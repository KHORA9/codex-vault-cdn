It was, however, the circumstance of my being situated\r\nin Manila for some years and thus having at my disposal the original\r\ndocuments bearing upon the history of the audiencia which was situated\r\nthere that led me to study this particular tribunal. At first sight it\r\nmay appear that something of direct applicability to Spanish-American\r\nconditions, which would have been gained by the study of the Audiencia\r\nof Mexico, or Guadalajara, or Lima, has thus been lost. Nevertheless,\r\nif it is borne in mind that the audiencia system was common to all the\r\nSpanish colonies, and that the laws by which it was constituted and\r\nregulated applied to the different political divisions of America as\r\nto the Philippines, the assumption will not seem wholly unjustified\r\nthat the Audiencia of Manila may be taken as a typical legal and\r\npolitical institution.\r\n\r\nA large part of the time expended in collecting the materials upon\r\nwhich this book is based was spent in the various depositories in\r\nManila. The most notable group of documents there is to be found in the\r\nPhilippines Library, and it is with pleasure that I express here my\r\nobligations to Dr. James Alexander Robertson, the librarian; for not\r\nonly did Dr. Robertson place at my disposal all the resources of the\r\nlibrary, but he contributed generously from his adequate knowledge of\r\nPhilippine history and afforded continual inspiration during the course\r\nof my labors in Manila. I am also deeply conscious of the assistance\r\nso kindly rendered by Don Manuel Artigas, chief of the Division of\r\nFilipiniana, and by Don Manuel Yriarte of the Philippine Archive.\r\n\r\nIn addition to research in the Philippines Library, the Philippine\r\nArchive, and the Audiencia Records in Manila approximately three years\r\nhave been spent in the archives of Spain. The main centre of my work,\r\nof course, has been the Archive of the Indies at Seville, where\r\nI was given free access to all the available materials, and every\r\nfacility was extended to me by the chief of the archive, Don Pedro\r\nTorres Lanzas, and by his obliging assistants. I am also indebted\r\nfor many courtesies to Don Miguel Gómez de Campillo of the National\r\nHistorical Archive at Madrid, and to Don Juan Montero, chief of the\r\narchive at Simancas.\r\n\r\nThe object of this prefatory note would not be achieved if I failed to\r\nexpress adequately my acknowledgment to my teacher and friend Professor\r\nFrederick J. Teggart, of the University of California. His inspiration\r\nled me to appreciate the importance of institutional studies; his\r\ncontinued encouragement has helped me over the hard places in the\r\nwork; and I am conscious now of the extent to which he has sought,\r\nby vigilant criticism, to guard me against precipitateness. I am\r\nindebted to Professor Herbert Bolton for valuable aid and for advice\r\nin the final presentation of the manuscript; to Dr. Charles Wilson\r\nHackett for a systematic revision of the Bibliography and of the\r\nfootnotes; to Professor E. C. Barker for advice and assistance; to\r\nProfessor W. R. Shepherd and Professor Francis S. Philbrick for their\r\ncriticism of portions of this book; and to Messrs. A. H. Allen and\r\nMorse A. Cartwright of the University of California Press for their\r\nmany manifestations of courtesy and patience in the supervision of\r\nits publication. To Professor H. Morse Stephens of the University of\r\nCalifornia and to the generous order of the Native Sons of the Golden\r\nWest I am indebted for the rare opportunity of two years of foreign\r\nresidence and research in the various archives of Spain.\r\n\r\nFinally, my greatest indebtedness is to my wife, who has cheerfully\r\ngiven up the pleasures and conveniences of life among friends in home\r\nsurroundings to accompany me to less pleasant places, in order that\r\nI might succeed in the work which I have undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 Charles H.

It has been considered\r\nalmost entirely as such by these modern historical writers who have\r\nreferred to it in passing. Its legislative, administrative, executive,\r\nand ecclesiastical functions have received little attention. This\r\nmay be owing to the fact that little or no documentary study of the\r\naudiencia has heretofore been made. A great deal of attention has been\r\ndevoted in this book to the non-judicial functions of the audiencia. A\r\nchapter has been given, indeed, to its purely judicial activities,\r\nbut the chief purpose of this investigation has been to show that\r\nthe audiencia was more than a court of justice, and to bring out its\r\ngovernmental and ecclesiastical functions.\r\n\r\nThis study will be confined, chronologically, to the period extending\r\nfrom the time of the creation of the audiencia, at the close of the\r\nsixteenth century, to the end of the eighteenth. This limitation is\r\nadvisable, first, because the vastness of the subject requires it, and\r\nsecond, because the audiencia became more concerned with judicial and\r\nless with administrative, political, and economic affairs through the\r\nconstitutional changes which were made at the close of the eighteenth\r\nand at the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. The audiencia thus\r\nloses its interest, from our present viewpoint, after the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Again, it may be said that owing to the loss of colonies by\r\nSpain in the early nineteenth century, and the general anarchy that\r\nprevailed after 1810, a continuation of an intensive study beyond\r\nthat period would be without value because its subject-matter would\r\nbe no longer characteristic.\r\n\r\nIn assuming that the Audiencia of Manila was typical of all the\r\naudiencias in the Spanish colonial system, it is not claimed that\r\nthe tribunal in the Philippines was identical in every function and\r\ndetail with those of the other colonies of Spain. It is no doubt\r\ntrue that local conditions brought about pronounced differences and\r\nthat each audiencia had its own local characteristics and powers,\r\nwhich differed from those of the others. The subject is so vast,\r\nhowever, and the research required for a comparative study of all\r\nthese institutions would be so extensive that it would occupy more\r\nthan a lifetime to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe main interest of this investigation does not lie in the\r\norganization, the scope, nature, or detailed powers of the audiencia\r\nas an institution of the Philippines, but in its larger relation\r\nto the general field of Spanish colonial history and government. It\r\napplies to the entire field of Spanish colonial administration. It\r\nis related to the government of Perú, New Spain, Cuba, and other\r\ncolonies wherein there were audiencias, and where functions similar\r\nto those of the Manila tribunal were exercised. The establishment of\r\nall these audiencias was part of the same movement, and the act of\r\ntheir creation was the product of experience gained in Spain through\r\nefforts at centralization there. The audiencias of the colonies were\r\nalike dependent on the Council of the Indies; common institutions\r\nand departments of government existed in Spain for the control\r\nand regulation of the tribunals of the colonies. All were of equal\r\njudicial rank before the Council of the Indies, and cases appealed to\r\nthe latter from the several audiencias were treated in the same manner\r\nand considered as having equal rank and importance. The general powers\r\nand attributes of these audiencias were prescribed in the same code,\r\nthe Recopilación, and general laws and cédulas of reform were expedited\r\nfrom time to time and sent to the tribunals of all the colonies. Such\r\nis the basis, therefore, of the claim that this is in reality a study\r\nof the audiencia as an institution, illustrated particularly by the\r\nhistory of that of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nA study of the audiencia of any colony is concerned with all of\r\nthe problems that came up in its life--with legal, political,\r\necclesiastical, and social conditions. It will be seen that the\r\naudiencia was the one tribunal which regulated, checked, and often\r\ncontrolled both church and state in the colonies; it represented the\r\nking, and its duty was to see that the royal commands were obeyed;\r\nit was the royal audiencia. Isolated as were the officials of the\r\nPhilippines, in those distant seas, removed from any but the most\r\nremote influence of the home government, beset on all sides by hostile\r\nforces, and dependent on themselves alone, conditions there present an\r\nespecially favorable field wherein to note the ultimate possibilities\r\nof the authority of the audiencia. It is the design of this treatise to\r\nexamine conditions in the Philippines under the aspects noted, and to\r\nassign them their place in the history of Spanish colonization. The\r\ninvestigation of what was, beyond doubt, the most important and\r\nmany-sided institution in the Spanish administration of the Philippines\r\nprovides a means of approach to that larger field of study.\r\n\r\nA survey of the Spanish colonial system or a study of the government\r\nof any one colony will reveal the fact that political life and\r\npower there were vested chiefly in three institutions. Upon\r\nthese the peace, prosperity and security of each colony largely\r\ndepended. These institutions were the audiencia, the office of viceroy,\r\nor captain-general, and the church. By means of the two former the\r\nroyal interests in the colony were represented, and through the latter\r\none of the chief aims of Spain's colonial system was effected, namely,\r\nthe conversion of infidels and the subsequent care of their souls. The\r\nchurch added to its own power in various ways. No study of Spanish\r\ncolonial institutions would be complete which failed to consider the\r\nchurch as a political power. It is to a consideration of these three\r\nchief factors of colonial government, and their interrelation, that\r\nthis study will be dedicated. After a review of the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the establishment of the Audiencia of Manila, we shall\r\ndevote ourselves to a detailed study of the audiencia itself. We\r\nshall first notice the audiencia's judicial functions as a court of\r\nordinary justice and secondarily as a court of residencia. The second\r\npart of this section will be concerned with the semi-judicial and\r\nadministrative functions of the audiencia.\r\n\r\nThe title of captain-general was primarily of military significance,\r\nand it was exercised alike by viceroys and governors; the official\r\ndesignation of the former being \"my viceroy and captain-general\"\r\nand that of the latter being \"my governor and captain-general.\" Not\r\nall governors were captains-general.\r\n\r\nThe viceroys in the larger divisions and the captains-general in the\r\nsmaller ones represented the king as head of the church and state\r\nin their several districts. Because these officials were so powerful\r\nand their duties so multitudinous, they came into contact with every\r\ndepartment of the government. The audiencias came into relation with\r\nthese officials most frequently. It is therefore necessary to study\r\nthe governor and captain-general first from the viewpoint of his\r\nposition as chief executive of the colony and as representative of\r\nthe king. The frequency of their relations and the identity of their\r\nspheres of authority suggest that we give attention to the conflicts\r\nof jurisdiction of the governor and audiencia; finally, we shall take\r\nnote of the occasions on which the audiencia assumed the government\r\non the event of a vacancy, noticing the laws authorizing such action\r\nand the principles underlying them.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the church in the Spanish colonial system has\r\nalready been alluded to. The extent of its power and the frequency\r\nand importance of its relations with the audiencia demand considerable\r\nattention. After studying the general phases of the relations of the\r\naudiencia and the church, we shall see that the tribunal exercised\r\necclesiastical authority of a very pronounced character. This power it\r\nderived from two sources: first, from the authority that was entrusted\r\nto it by virtue of the royal patronage; second, from its status as a\r\ncourt of justice with jurisdiction in ecclesiastical affairs similar\r\nto that which it had as an ordinary tribunal of justice. The above\r\nis an outline of the plan of this book.\r\n\r\nThat which impresses the modern student most with regard to Spanish\r\nadministrative machinery was its failure to effect deliberately the\r\ndivision of powers which, with our traditions, we consider essential\r\nto a well-balanced government. The terms \"executive\" and \"judicial\"\r\nare employed in this book, as they were in Spain's colonies, to\r\ndesignate functions rather than departments. The viceroy, as president\r\nof the audiencia, had cognizance of certain judicial matters, and\r\nmore or less participation in them, though he was forbidden to act\r\nas judge, especially over affairs in which he had already officiated\r\nas executive. The audiencia likewise shared many executive functions,\r\nyet it was not judge of its own acts, for when judgment was passed on\r\nthe administrative acts or judicial pronouncements of an oidor, either\r\non appeal or by review of sentence, that magistrate was expected to\r\nretire, or to be occupied with some other case. So, while there was no\r\njudicial department with solely judicial functions, or a legislative\r\nor executive department, as they are known in some modern states,\r\nthere existed certain interrelations which did not entirely result in\r\nconfusion, as one might suppose. On the contrary, it may be often noted\r\nthat as a resultant of this system, men and acts of an exceedingly\r\nwell-balanced and statesmanlike character were produced. We shall see,\r\nmoreover, that they were far from meriting the disapprobation that\r\nis frequently heaped upon so-called Spanish governmental incapacity.\r\n\r\nThe defects which appear so conspicuous in Spanish administration were\r\nlargely due to the extremely methodical turn of the Spanish official\r\nmind, the vastness of the empire which was to be governed, and the\r\nlack of facilities available for efficient administration. It was a\r\ngovernment of expedientes, literally a government on paper. All acts,\r\nestimates, budgets, and plans had to be drafted and written out,\r\nduplicates and triplicates of each report had to be made, advice\r\nhad to be taken, and opinions rendered, whether the matter went any\r\nfurther than the theoretical stage or not. We do much the same in our\r\nmodern age, but inventions and labor-saving devices have fortunately\r\nspared us much of the time and effort which a few centuries ago\r\nhad to be expended to accomplish proportionate results. The apparent\r\nunwieldiness of the Spanish colonial empire would have been materially\r\nreduced by the use of the telegraph, cable, steamship, typewriter\r\nand carbon-paper.\r\n\r\nAn effort has been made that this should be something more than\r\na theoretical dissertation. A knowledge that certain laws were\r\npromulgated is only half of what is necessary in a study of this\r\ncharacter. It is imperative to understand how these laws were applied,\r\nand whether they were efficiently and effectively carried out. Every\r\nphase of the audiencia's history has, therefore, been illustrated\r\nwherever possible with one or more concrete cases, taken from actual\r\npractice. Many of these illustrations are comparatively insignificant\r\nby themselves, involving persons of no historical importance and\r\nconcerning matters of a seemingly trivial nature. Nevertheless, it\r\nhas been necessary to consider these matters carefully because they\r\nwere typical and true to actual conditions, and because they reveal\r\nbetter than anything else could the affairs which were the concern\r\nof the audiencia, showing the part played by the tribunal in the life\r\nof the colony.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this work due deference has been paid to the\r\nstandard authorities usually cited by writers of Spanish-American\r\nhistory. So little attention has been given by students of Spanish\r\ncolonial history to the audiencia as an institution, however, that\r\nthe present writer has been obliged to depend almost entirely on the\r\nhitherto untouched documentary material in Spain and the Philippines,\r\nand to place almost his sole reliance upon it. This material consists\r\nof laws, cédulas, royal orders, ordinances, correspondence, and lastly,\r\nbut most important, records of cases and actual happenings in the\r\nform of letters, memorials, reports, complaints and contemporary\r\naccounts. These latter convey, as nothing else can, an idea of how\r\nthe laws were carried out, what was their effect, what part the\r\naudiencia played in the interpretation and execution of the law,\r\nand the relations of the tribunal to the other authorities and\r\ninstitutions of government. Of this sort of material there is much,\r\nand in its light the history of the Spanish colonies and of their\r\ninstitutions yet remains to be written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE AUDIENCIAS OF THE SPANISH COLONIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish system of colonial administration was an adaptation beyond\r\nthe seas of fundamental administrative, judicial and ecclesiastical\r\ninstitutions and principles which had grown up and had proved\r\nserviceable throughout a long period of successful use in Spain. As\r\nthe audiencias and their allied officials had shown themselves to be\r\nefficient as agencies of centralization in the isolated provinces\r\nof Spain, so they were utilized, by the organization which they\r\neffected, to bring the colonies nearer the mother country. When\r\nSpain was confronted with the necessity of governing her vast empire,\r\nit was natural that she should profit by her former administrative\r\nexperience, and make use of those institutions of government which\r\nhad proved successful at home.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the present chapter is to emphasize the fact that, these\r\ninstitutions which had served in Spain, and were still in process\r\nof development there, were utilized in all of the colonies. The\r\nPhilippine audiencia, which will be more particularly studied in\r\nsubsequent chapters, was not a rare and isolated exception, but\r\nrather an integral part of a great administrative system. [1] This\r\nwill more clearly appear from a sketch of the early development of\r\ncolonial administration.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the terms of the concession made by the Catholic\r\nMonarchs at Santa Fé on April 30, 1492, Columbus was given the title of\r\n\"Admiral, Viceroy, and Governor of the Undiscovered Lands and Seas of\r\nthe Indies.\" [2] He was likewise entrusted with the duty of proposing\r\nthree candidates for the government of each colony, and from these\r\nthree names the king was to select one. It was further provided that\r\nthe alcaldes and alguaciles for the administration of justice should\r\nbe named by Columbus, and that he should hear appeals from these\r\nminor judges in second instance. This is a brief outline of the first\r\ngovernment and judiciary provided for the New World. It is improbable\r\nthat this arrangement was the product of any great amount of study\r\nor reflection. It was formulated before the New World had even been\r\ndiscovered, and this scheme, as well as the conditions of commerce\r\nand tribute which went with it, were largely proposed by Columbus,\r\nand acceded to by the Catholic Monarchs without anticipation of\r\nthe tremendous consequences which were to come from that voyage of\r\ndiscovery and those which were to follow it.\r\n\r\nWhen Columbus undertook his second and later voyages the Catholic\r\nrulers began to modify the conditions of the original compact\r\nby sending royal representatives with him to take account of his\r\nexpeditions. The difficulties which Columbus had in the government of\r\nhis West Indian colony are too well known to be more than referred to\r\nhere. Through the influence of Fonseca, and the gradual realization of\r\nthe tremendous size and importance of the new dominions, the rulers\r\nof Spain began to feel that a mistake had been made in granting to\r\nthis Genoese sailor and to his heirs the complete proprietorship and\r\ngovernment of this distant empire. The abrogation of the contract was a\r\nnatural consequence. It was the repudiation of a colonial system which\r\nhad been created in the dark, and formulated without a knowledge of the\r\nconditions and problems to be met. Such an arrangement was foredoomed\r\nto failure, and if the colonies were to be administered successfully,\r\nreform was necessary.\r\n\r\nIn 1507, the towns of Española petitioned the king for the same\r\nprivileges and forms of government as were possessed by the towns of\r\nSpain. The request was granted, and municipal rights were bestowed upon\r\nfourteen towns. These concessions included the privilege of electing\r\ntheir own regidores and alcaldes ordinarios [3] and the rights of\r\nlocal legislation and administration of justice. The principle was\r\nsubsequently enunciated that,\r\n\r\n\r\n    inasmuch as the kingdoms of Castile and of the Indies are under\r\n    one crown, the laws and the order of government of one should be as\r\n    similar to and as much in agreement with the other as possible; our\r\n    royal council, in the laws and establishments which are ordered,\r\n    must strive to reduce the form and manner of their government to\r\n    the style and order by which the kingdoms of Castile and León\r\n    are governed and ruled, to the extent that the diversity and\r\n    difference of the lands and nations permit. [4]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1511, a tribunal of independent royal judges was constituted in the\r\ncolony of Española to try cases appealed from the town magistrates\r\nand the governor. [5] This judicial body may be considered as the\r\npredecessor of the royal audiencia which was established fifteen years\r\nlater. The organization and purpose of the tribunal were exactly\r\nsimilar to those of the courts existing in the frontier provinces\r\nof Spain before the establishment of audiencias. The chief reason\r\nfor its creation was the need of checking the abuses of an absolute\r\ngovernor. This tribunal was composed of three magistrates, who were\r\npossessed of the licentiate's degree, designated as alcaldes mayores,\r\nand appointed by the king. They were empowered to hear and determine\r\nappeals from the governor and from his tenientes and alcaldes. [6]\r\nThese magistrates, acting collectively, became at once official\r\norgans for the expression of the needs of the colony in non-judicial\r\nmatters, frequently presenting memorials to the Council of the Indies\r\nindependently of the governor. [7] The crown had already assumed\r\ndirection of the administrative and executive affairs of the colony of\r\nPuerto Rico, on August 15, 1509, by naming a special governor for that\r\nisland. On July 25, 1511, Diego Colón, son of the discoverer, was named\r\ngovernor of Española, and of the other islands and of the mainland\r\ndiscovered by his father. This latter act of royal intervention did\r\nnot confirm, but rather abrogated in practice, the claims of this same\r\nColón to the inheritance of the provinces which had been given formerly\r\nto his father. This act maintained the pre-eminence and authority of\r\nthe Spanish monarchs in these territories. [8] The further growth and\r\ndevelopment of the West Indian colonies, and especially the increasing\r\nSpanish population, called for the establishment of a more efficient\r\ntribunal of administration and justice. This need was met in the\r\ncreation of the first audiencia in America, that of Santo Domingo,\r\nwhich was established September 14, 1526.\r\n\r\nThe law, which has been cited already, providing that the\r\nadministration of the Indies should be patterned in all ways after\r\nthe governments of Castile and León, shows very clearly the natural\r\ninfluence of the early history and institutions of Spain. The\r\naudiencias established in the colonies were at first similar in\r\njurisdiction and organization to those of Spain, which country had\r\nalready succeeded in governing provinces that were, in effect, almost\r\nas isolated and as far from actual contact with the court as were the\r\nIndies. The audiencia of Spain had proved of immense value as an agency\r\nof direct control. It had been found satisfactory under conditions very\r\nsimilar to those in the Indies, which were not regarded as foreign\r\npossessions, but as integral parts of Castile, being the property of\r\nthe monarchs of that kingdom, and under their personal direction.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with a description of the growth of the audiencia\r\nsystem, it is desirable, first, to note the establishment in Spain\r\nof two organs for the administration of colonial affairs. These\r\nmay be examined here conveniently, because their creation\r\nantedated the institution of the audiencia in the colonies. The\r\nfirst, chronologically, as well as in importance, was the Casa de\r\nContratación, which was created January 10, 1503. [9] This essentially\r\ncommercial body was intended at first to supervise the import and\r\nexport trade of Spain with the colonies, and to arrange for the\r\nsale and distribution of imported articles, concessions of cargo to\r\nindividuals, the lading and discharging of cargo, and the collection of\r\nduties. The functions of this body were soon amplified to the extent\r\nthat it was given jurisdiction over emigration to the colonies. In\r\n1509 it was granted further authority over certain criminal cases\r\nrelating to trade, and in 1510, letrados were added to the tribunal\r\nof the Casa for the better determination of legal affairs.\r\n\r\nAs established in 1503, the Casa de Contratación consisted of a\r\ntreasurer, auditor (comptroller), and factor. [10] That the institution\r\nflourished and increased in importance may be deduced from the reform\r\nof Philip II, on September 25, 1583, whereby the above mentioned\r\nofficials were retained and a royal audiencia was created within\r\nthe Casa. This was composed of three jueces letrados and a fiscal,\r\nbesides the numerous subordinate officials who usually accompanied\r\nthe judicial tribunal. [11] Though at first it exercised some of the\r\nfunctions which belonged later to the Council of the Indies, it came\r\nsubsequently to be subordinate to that body. [12] It was transferred\r\nto Cádiz in 1717, and was suppressed by the royal decree of June 18,\r\n1790. [13] its remaining attributions being assumed by the Consulado\r\nof Seville. [14]\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of the Council of the Indies may be noted in the\r\ncreation of a special committee of the Council of Castile for the\r\nsupervision of administrative affairs in the colonies. This was\r\neight years after the establishment of the Casa de Contratación,\r\nwhen another need than the purely commercial, for which the Casa de\r\nContratación had served, began to be felt. [15] The inadequacy of\r\nthe system devised by the Catholic Monarchs at Santa Fé had already\r\nbecome evident. The problems of administration in the colonies were\r\nmaking clear the need of a more effective system of regulation. Just\r\nas the number of suits to be tried before the old tribunal de la cort\r\ndel rey had increased to such an extent that the king could no longer\r\nattend to them personally, so the problems of administration in the\r\nnew colonies demanded more attention and regulation than could be\r\nprovided by the administrative machinery at hand. The functions of\r\nthis new tribunal, if it may be designated as such at this time, do\r\nnot seem to have been clearly expressed at first, at least by any law\r\nor decree now at hand, but it appears that they were advisory rather\r\nthan administrative. It soon became evident that a distinction had\r\nto be made between the prerogatives of this council and those of the\r\nCasa de Contratación. During the early history of these two tribunals\r\nthere was considerable conflict of jurisdiction between them. It is\r\nprobable that until the reform of August 4, 1524, was promulgated,\r\nactive supervision of colonial affairs was maintained by the Council\r\nof Castile, both the Casa de Contratación and this new tribunal of\r\nthe Indies acting under its direction. Charles V gave new life to the\r\ntribunal of the Indies on the above date by assigning to it definite\r\nlegislative and administrative powers, putting at its head Loaysa,\r\nthe general of the Dominican order and his own confessor. The Council\r\nwas further modified by Charles V in 1542, and by Philip II in 1571,\r\nin the following terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is our royal will that the said council shall have the\r\n    supreme jurisdiction in all our occidental Indies ... and of the\r\n    affairs which result from them, ... and for the good government\r\n    and administration of justice, it may order and make with our\r\n    advice, the laws, pragmatics, ordinances and provisions, general\r\n    and particular, ... which ... may be required for the good of the\r\n    provinces ... and in the matters pertaining to the Indies, that the\r\n    said our council be obeyed and respected, and that its provisions\r\n    in all, and by all be fulfilled and obeyed in all particulars. [16]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Council of the Indies, as established in 1524, consisted of\r\na president, a high chancellor, eight members who were lawyers, a\r\nfiscal, two secretaries and a lieutenant chancellor. [17] All these\r\nwere required to be of noble birth and qualified by experience and\r\nability to carry to a successful issue the high responsibilities\r\nwhich they were called upon to discharge. [18] Besides there was a\r\ncorps of accountants, auditors, copyists, reporters and clerks. The\r\nnumber of these last-mentioned functionaries was enormous, especially\r\nin subsequent years, when correspondence with twelve or thirteen\r\ndifferent colonies was maintained.\r\n\r\nThe Council of the Indies was the high court of appeal to which all\r\ncases from the colonial audiencias came for final adjudication. It\r\nwas, however, not only a court of appeal in judicial matters, but\r\nalso a directive ministry for the supervision of the administrative\r\nacts of the colonial audiencias and executives.\r\n\r\nThe unqualified success of the Audiencia of Santo Domingo, both as a\r\ntribunal of justice and as an administrative organ, led to the general\r\nestablishment of the institution throughout the Spanish colonial\r\nempire. The audiencias which were created in Spain's colonies from\r\n1526 to 1893 follow in the order of their establishment. [19]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Santo Domingo, created September 14, 1526, consisting of a\r\n    president, four oidores, [20] and a fiscal.\r\n\r\n    Mexico, [21] created November 29, 1527, consisting of two chambers\r\n    or salas, a criminal and a civil, a president, eight oidores,\r\n    four alcaldes del crimen, and two fiscales for civil and criminal\r\n    cases respectively.\r\n\r\n    Panamá, created February 30, 1535, with a president, four oidores\r\n    and a fiscal.\r\n\r\n    Lima, created November 20, 1542, with two chambers, a civil and\r\n    a criminal, a president, eight oidores, four criminal alcaldes,\r\n    and two fiscales, as in Mexico.\r\n\r\n    Santiago de Guatemala, created September 13, 1543, with a\r\n    president, five oidores, and a fiscal.\r\n\r\n    Guadalajara, created February 15, 1548, with a president, four\r\n    oidores, and a fiscal.\r\n\r\n    Santa Fé (New Granada), created July 17, 1549, with a president,\r\n    four oidores, and a fiscal.\r\n\r\n    La Plata (Charcas), created September 4, 1559, with a president,\r\n    five oidores, and a fiscal.\r\n\r\n    San Francisco de Quito, created November 29, 1563, with a\r\n    president, four oidores, and a fiscal.\r\n\r\n    Manila, created May 5, 1583, with a president, four oidores,\r\n    and a fiscal.\r\n\r\n    Santiago de Chile, created February 17, 1609, with a president,\r\n    four oidores, and a fiscal.\r\n\r\n    Buenos Ayres, created November 2, 1661, with a president, three\r\n    oidores, and a fiscal; recreated July 2, 1778, when Buenos Ayres\r\n    was made a viceroyalty.\r\n\r\n    Caracas, created June 13, 1786, with a regent, three oidores,\r\n    and a fiscal.\r\n\r\n    Cuzco, created February 26, 1787, with a regent, three oidores,\r\n    and a fiscal.\r\n\r\n    Puerto Rico, created June 19, 1831, to consist of a president,\r\n    regent, three oidores, and a fiscal.\r\n\r\n    Havana, created September 26, 1835, reorganized June 16, 1838,\r\n    to consist of a regent, four oidores, and two fiscales. [22]\r\n\r\n    Puerto Príncipe, transferred in 1797 from Santo Domingo,\r\n    reorganized September 26, 1835, to consist of a regent, four\r\n    oidores, and a fiscal. This audiencia was suppressed and its\r\n    territory added to that of Havana on October 21, 1853. It was\r\n    recreated on February 22, 1878, and on May 23, 1879.\r\n\r\n    Santiago de Cuba, created September 26, 1835, to consist of\r\n    a regent, four oidores, and a fiscal. This audiencia was later\r\n    suppressed, and its territory was added to the Audiencia of Havana;\r\n    it was again reformed and added to Puerto Príncipe on February\r\n    22, 1878.\r\n\r\n    Cebú (Philippines), created February 26, 1886, to consist of a\r\n    president, four magistrates, a fiscal, and an assistant fiscal.\r\n\r\n    Vigán (Philippines) created on May 19, 1893, to consist of one\r\n    chief justice, two associates, a prosecuting attorney, and an\r\n    assistant prosecutor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the audiencias of Mexico and Lima contained\r\nthe greatest number of magistrates. They were divided into\r\ntwo salas, a civil and a criminal, with appropriate judges and\r\nfiscales for each. [23] The judges of the criminal branch were\r\ndesignated as alcaldes and not as oidores. These audiencias were at\r\nfirst conterminous in territorial jurisdiction with the respective\r\ncaptaincies-general of those names, but they enjoyed no greater power\r\nor pre-eminence before the Council of the Indies than the audiencias\r\nof the lesser captaincies-general. In the words of the royal decree\r\nof establishment,\r\n\r\n\r\n    there are founded twelve royal audiencias and chanceries ... in\r\n    order that our vassals may have persons to rule and govern them\r\n    in peace and justice, and their districts have been divided\r\n    into governments, corregimientos and alcaldes mayores who will\r\n    be provided in accordance with our orders and laws and will be\r\n    subordinate to our royal audiencias and to our Supreme Council\r\n    of the Indies ... and may no change be made without our express\r\n    order or that of the Council. [24]\r\n\r\n\r\nMany changes were made in the territorial jurisdiction of the\r\nvarious audiencias. The audiencias of Lima and Mexico, in addition\r\nto their jurisdiction over their respective viceroyalties, exercised\r\ngovernmental authority over the adjacent districts when the viceroys\r\nwere absent; the Audiencia of Lima over Charcas, Quito and Tierra\r\nFirme (Panamá), and that of Mexico over what was later Guadalajara,\r\nthe Philippines, and Yucatán. All of these, except the latter, came\r\nto have audiencias, with the usual powers and authority. [25]\r\n\r\nThe first seven audiencias were founded by Charles V. Three were\r\ncreated by Philip II. The audiencias of Santiago de Chile and Buenos\r\nAyres were established by Philip III and Philip IV, respectively. The\r\ngreater number of these audiencias was created at the time of the most\r\nrapid extension of the tribunals in Spain; their establishment was part\r\nof the same general tendency; they were therefore closely related. When\r\nthe audiencias of Santo Domingo and Mexico were formed, there had\r\nbeen already in existence in Spain the chanceries of Valladolid, and\r\nGranada. Thirteen audiencias were established in Spain after those\r\nof Santo Domingo and New Spain were created in the colonies. The two\r\nSpanish audiencias mentioned above were designated as models for the\r\ntribunals of the Indies, and the principle was laid down that if a\r\nnecessary provision was omitted from the laws of establishment of\r\nthe colonial audiencias, \"all the presidents and audiencias of those\r\nour realms are ordered to preserve the order and practices which are\r\nfollowed in the chanceries of Granada and Valladolid.\" [26]\r\n\r\nTerritorially, the audiencias of Santo Domingo, Mexico, and Lima were\r\nthe nucleii from which and around which most of the other audiencias\r\nwere established. Being the first in their respective sections,\r\nthey included more territory than they could govern with facility;\r\nthus it later became necessary to divide up their districts. Santo\r\nDomingo held sway at first over Española, Cuba, and Puerto Rico,\r\nwith authority also over Venezuela and subsequently over Louisiana\r\nand Florida. [27] New Granada was conceded an audiencia in 1549,\r\nand to this province were added the possessions of Panamá when the\r\naudiencia of that name was suppressed. The Audiencia of Mexico, created\r\neight years before New Spain was made a viceroyalty, had territorial\r\njurisdiction at first over a vast empire, which was later divided into\r\nsmaller governments with audiencias. Its limits, as defined in the\r\nlaws of the Indies, extended on both oceans from the Cape of Florida\r\nto the Cape of Honduras, and included Yucatán, and Tabasco. [28]\r\n\r\nThe audiencias of Guadalajara, Santiago de Guatemala, and Manila all\r\nset definite limits to the jurisdiction of the Audiencia of Mexico. The\r\nAudiencia of Lima had authority at first over most of Spanish South\r\nAmerica, but its scope was in the same manner diminished from time\r\nto time by the establishment of the audiencias of Santa Fé, La Plata\r\n(Charcas), Quito, Santiago de Chile, and Buenos Ayres. Before the\r\nAudiencia of Cuzco was instituted in 1787, jurisdiction over that\r\nancient city and district was divided between the audiencias of Lima\r\nand La Plata; Árica, although it belonged to the district of Lima,\r\nwas not governed under that jurisdiction, but was administered by\r\na corregidor directly responsible to the audiencia at Charcas. [29]\r\nChile and Panamá were subordinate governmentally to the viceroy of\r\nPerú, but the audiencias were independent. [30]\r\n\r\nCuba was early divided into two districts under the rule of\r\ncaptains-general, those of Havana and Santiago de Cuba. [31] By\r\ncédula of February 24, 1784, Havana was made independent of the\r\nAudiencia of Santo Domingo in administrative matters. Aside from the\r\none at Puerto Príncipe, audiencias were not created in Cuba, however,\r\nuntil 1835 and 1838, respectively. Prior to this, Cuba was subject to\r\nthe Audiencia of Puerto Príncipe, the successor of Santo Domingo, in\r\njudicial matters, as the governments in Cuba were military. However,\r\nmilitary cases were carried before the captains-general of Havana\r\nand of Santiago de Cuba, respectively. [32]\r\n\r\nAlthough all the audiencias had the same rank before the Council of\r\nthe Indies, both as political and judicial tribunals, those of Lima\r\nand Mexico may be said to have been tribunals of the first class, for\r\nreasons which we have noted. Indeed, it must be remembered that it\r\nwas the individual captaincy-general that had an audiencia, whether\r\nthe captaincy-general happened to be a viceroyalty or not. Judged\r\nby the amount of power they exercised, there were three classes of\r\naudiencias: those of the viceroyalties, of the captaincies-general, and\r\nof the presidencies. On this basis of classification, it may be said\r\nthat the first-mentioned were the superior institutions. In matters\r\nof military administration, the captains-general had the same power\r\nas the viceroys, while the audiencias exercised less intervention in\r\nthe government than in the presidencies. In the latter, the audiencias\r\n(and presidents) exercised governmental functions as well as judicial,\r\nwith appeal to the viceroy. Though they had no military power,\r\nand their scope was strictly limited in financial affairs, these\r\naudiencias actually governed their districts. This the audiencias of\r\nthe viceroyalties never did, except when they governed ad interim.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with a study of the powers and duties of the\r\ncolonial audiencias, it would be well to compare them, as to extent\r\nof jurisdiction and authority, with those which were in operation\r\nin Spain. Were they equal? Did the colonial institutions, on account\r\nof their isolation, exercise prerogatives which were unknown to the\r\ntribunals of the Peninsula, or vice versa? These questions were\r\nanswered by Juan de Solórzano y Pereyra, a distinguished Spanish\r\njurist, oidor of the Audiencia of Lima in 1610, and subsequently\r\ncouncillor of the Indies. [33] Solórzano y Pereyra illustrates\r\nfourteen points of difference wherein the audiencias of the\r\ncolonies exceeded those of the Peninsula in power and authority,\r\nin these matters exercising jurisdiction equal to the Council\r\nof Castile. This, he said, was \"on account of the great distance\r\nintervening between them and the king or his royal Council of the\r\nIndies, and the dangers which delay may occasion.\" Therefore, he said,\r\nthe audiencias had been permitted many privileges and powers denied\r\nto the audiencias of Spain. The most important of these powers were\r\nas follows: jurisdiction over residencias of corregidores; the right\r\nto send out special investigators (pesquisidores); supervision over\r\ninferior judges--seeing that they properly tried cases under their\r\nauthority, care for the education and good treatment of the Indians\r\nin spiritual and temporal matters, and the punishment of officials\r\nwho were remiss in that particular; the collection of tithes; the\r\nassumption of the rights and obligations of the royal patronage,\r\nas well as jurisdiction over cases affecting the same, the building\r\nof churches, the installment of curates and holders of benefices,\r\nand the inspection and possible retention of bulls and briefs.\r\n\r\nThe colonial audiencias were instructed to guard the royal prerogative,\r\nand were authorized to try all persons accused of usurping the royal\r\njurisdiction. They were to see that officials, lay and ecclesiastical,\r\ndid not charge excessive fees for their services, limiting especially\r\nthose exorbitant charges which priests were apt to demand at burials,\r\nfunerals, marriages and baptisms. The colonial audiencias were\r\ngiven supervision over espolios, [34] collecting, administering and\r\ndisposing of the properties left by deceased prelates, and paying\r\nclaims of heirs and creditors. Another duty was the restraining\r\nof ecclesiastical judges and dignitaries through the recurso de\r\nfuerza. [35] This authority had been permitted to the chanceries of\r\nValladolid and Granada, only.\r\n\r\nAlthough viceroys and governors were granted special jurisdiction over\r\nadministrative matters, they were authorized to call upon the acuerdos\r\n[36] of the audiencias for counsel and advice whenever an exceptionally\r\narduous case presented itself. The audiencias were permitted to\r\nentertain appeals against the rulings of viceroys and presidents, but\r\nthese appeals could be carried again to the Council of the Indies. In\r\nthe same manner that affairs of government belonged to the private\r\njurisdiction of the executive, so did financial matters, according\r\nto Solórzano y Pereyra. In these, however, the viceroy or governor\r\nwas assisted in the solution of perplexing problems by the acuerdo\r\ngeneral de hacienda, a body composed of oidores, oficiales reales [37]\r\nand contadores. On the death, disability, or absence of the viceroy or\r\ngovernor and captain-general it was ordered that the government should\r\npass under the charge of the entire audiencia. Lastly, Solórzano y\r\nPereyra pointed out that while the sole duty of the Spanish oidores\r\nwas to try cases, the magistrates of the colonial audiencias were\r\ncalled upon for a number of miscellaneous functions, such as those of\r\nvisitador, or inspector of the provinces, or of other departments of\r\nthe government, as asesor of the Santa Cruzada, [38] as inspector of\r\nships, as auditor de guerra, as asesor of the governor, and as juez\r\nde las executorías, under commission of the Council of the Indies\r\nto collect and remit to the government receiver all money derived\r\nfrom fines and penalties imposed by official visitors (visitadores),\r\njudges of residencia, etcetera. [39]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the entertainment of the recurso de fuerza,\r\nnone of the above-mentioned functions could be exercised by the\r\naudiencias of Spain. Although the colonial audiencias were to a\r\nlarge extent patterned after those of Spain, they had greater\r\npower and exercised more extensive functions almost from the\r\nbeginning. This was chiefly owing to the added responsibilities of\r\ngovernment resulting from the isolation of the colonies and their\r\ndistance from the home government. The audiencias in Spain remained\r\nalmost purely judicial. There was no need or opportunity for them\r\nto encroach upon the executive, or to usurp its functions, because\r\nof the control exercised by its immediate representatives. In the\r\ncolonies the audiencias were themselves established as the agents of\r\nthe royal authority, with the special duty of limiting the abuses\r\nof the officials of the crown. In this capacity, aside from their\r\ncustomary duties, the tribunals exercised far-reaching authority of\r\na non-judicial character.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to point out in this connection that all the\r\ncolonial audiencias utilized the same law in common. Cédulas,\r\nedicts, and decrees were issued to them from a common source, to\r\nbe executed under similar circumstances, or on particular occasions\r\nwhen local conditions demanded such action. The great code of 1680,\r\nthe Recopilación de leyes de los Reinos de las Indias, has already\r\nbeen described as containing laws, both general and particular,\r\nfor the regulation of the colonial audiencias. [40]\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing paragraphs attention has been directed briefly to\r\nthe relations of the audiencias and executives with each other, and\r\nwith the central government. Some notice at least should be given\r\nto the means by which the will of the executive and judiciary was\r\nenforced and executed upon and in the local units, the provinces and\r\ntowns. We have already seen that the offices of the corregidores,\r\nalcaldes mayores and the alcaldes ordinarios developed in Spain,\r\nthe first with jurisdiction over the larger districts, the alcaldes\r\nmayores over the smaller areas and large towns, and the alcaldes\r\nordinarios in the municipalities. In a general sense, this system\r\nwas carried into the colonies; the corregidores and alcaldes mayores\r\nwere in charge of the large provinces and districts, the alcaldes\r\nordinarios were the judges of the Spanish towns.\r\n\r\nMuch the same intercourse and relations existed between these officials\r\nin the colonies as had been characteristic of the similar ones of\r\nSpain. But there were some differences: while in Spain the alcaldes\r\nwere in most cases city judges, subject to the corregidores, [41]\r\nin the colonies there was little or no difference between alcaldes\r\nmayores and corregidores. They were most frequently appointed by the\r\nexecutive, sometimes independently, sometimes by the assistance and\r\nadvice of the audiencia, as judges and governors of the provinces,\r\nalthough the laws of the Indies provided for their appointment\r\nby the king. The practice developed of designating them locally,\r\nand of sending their names to Spain for confirmation. Each alcalde\r\nmayor or corregidor resided at the chief town of his province and\r\ncombined in himself the functions of judge, inspector of encomiendas,\r\nadministrator of hacienda and police, collector of tribute, vicepatron\r\nand captain-general. [42] He was assisted by officials of a minor\r\ncategory, frequently natives, who exercised jurisdiction over their\r\nfellows. The law also provided for a teniente letrado to assist the\r\nalcalde or corregidor, [43] but in the Philippines there was no such\r\nofficial, except at irregular intervals in the Visayas.\r\n\r\nThese chiefs of provinces were responsible to the audiencias\r\nin matters of justice and to the viceroys or captains-general\r\nin administrative affairs. In Indian relations and in questions\r\ninvolving encomiendas they were subject to the executive, who had\r\njurisdiction in first instance, with appeal to the audiencia. The\r\ntribunal could grant encomiendas in default of the regularly appointed\r\nexecutive. In financial matters the corregidores and alcaldes mayores\r\nwere responsible to the executive, but they acted as the agents of\r\nthe treasury officials (oficiales reales) in the collection of the\r\nrevenue. In their provinces they supervised the building of ships,\r\nthe construction of roads and bridges, the repartimientos or polos\r\n[44] of Indians, and the planting of tobacco when the tobacco monopoly\r\nexisted in the Philippines. In these matters they were responsible to\r\nthe governor, viceroy, or superintendent, and to the various juntas\r\nreales and committees, of which at least one oidor was always a member.\r\n\r\nTributes from the Indians, tithes from the encomenderos and other\r\nkinds of local taxes were collected by the alcaldes mayores and\r\ncorregidores. Acting for the vicepatron, these officials represented\r\nthe subdelegated authority of the king over the monasteries and\r\nchurches of their provinces. They officiated at the formal bestowal of\r\nbenefices, they were expected to maintain harmonious relations with\r\nthe priests and friars in their provinces, and to check, by their\r\npersonal presence and intervention, if necessary, any tendency on\r\nthe part of the churchmen to abuse the Indians or to impose upon them.\r\n\r\nIn like manner they were supposed to prevent the ecclesiastical judges\r\nfrom exceeding their power, and particularly from transgressing\r\nthe royal jurisdiction, which frequently occurred in the earlier\r\nyears when that authority had not become clearly defined or firmly\r\nestablished. As the churchmen with whom these officials had to deal\r\nderived their authority from the higher prelates and the provincials of\r\nthe orders and often acted by their direction, their opposition to the\r\nlocal officials of the civil government was frequently so effective\r\nthat the latter were obliged to appeal to the audiencia. The latter\r\ntribunal had the power necessary to deal with these cases, and to\r\nrestrain the offending churchmen, by bringing pressure to bear upon\r\ntheir prelates and superiors.\r\n\r\nThe provincial governors also had certain military duties. In the\r\nnorthern provinces of New Spain they had charge of defense, with\r\nresponsibility to the viceroy. [45] In the Philippines, however,\r\nand in certain parts of New Spain, where the captain-general took\r\nthe place of the viceroy, alcaldes mayores and corregidores acted\r\nas lieutenants of the captains-general, exercising authority of a\r\nmilitary character. [46] They were required to defend their provinces\r\nand districts against invasions, insurrections, Indian outbreaks,\r\nand disturbances. They were authorized to impress men for military\r\nservice. Local conditions in Mexico, Perú, Central America, and\r\nthe Philippines caused some differentiation in these matters. This\r\ndescription will serve to convey an impression of the nature of the\r\nduties of these officials and the way in which they acted as the\r\nagents of the captain-general, viceroy, and audiencia. [47]\r\n\r\nIt has been already pointed out that the alcaldes mayores and\r\ncorregidores had extensive judicial duties; a mere restatement of\r\nthat important fact will suffice at this time. In subsequent chapters\r\nwe shall study in detail numerous illustrations and instances of the\r\njudicial functions of the provincial judges. It has been noted also\r\nthat the alcaldes ordinarios were the judges of the Spanish towns. So\r\nthey were in the Philippines, but, as there were only four or five\r\nSpanish towns in the archipelago, the alcaldes ordinarios do not\r\nassume great prominence in this study. These alcaldes were usually\r\nchosen by the ayuntamientos (municipal councils), though they were\r\nappointed on some occasions by the governors. As the Spanish towns\r\nenjoyed special privileges conferred by the king, their judges were\r\nnot a part of the regular judicial hierarchy, but were dependent on\r\ntheir ayuntamientos or the governor. However, an oidor was usually\r\ndelegated to inspect the work of the alcalde ordinario.\r\n\r\nWith this introductory view of the general field of Spanish colonial\r\nadministration, and this presentation of the characters and elements\r\nwhich are to assume important roles in this discussion because of\r\ntheir frequent relations with the audiencia, we may enter upon a\r\nmore detailed study of a single institution. It has been emphasized\r\nespecially that the audiencia in the Philippines was only an integral\r\npart of the governmental machinery used in the colonial empire of\r\nSpain. It is clear, therefore, that we are not studying an isolated\r\ntribunal, for every royal cédula promulgated to the Philippine\r\naudiencia was in some way related to those issued to ten or eleven\r\nother audiencias of equal status or similar character. Although the\r\nPhilippines were apart physically, this institution, with its relation\r\nto the provincial and colonial governments on one hand, and the home\r\ngovernment on the other, brought the colony as close as possible to\r\nSpain, and to the other colonies.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the growth of audiencias was a part, not\r\nonly of colonial, but of Spanish historical and institutional\r\ndevelopment. These institutions served the same purpose in the\r\ncolonies that they accomplished in Spain; they were utilized for the\r\nadministration of justice, and to check the excesses and abuses of\r\nofficials. They were important because they facilitated a greater\r\ndegree of centralization. They converged the provincial, colonial,\r\nintercolonial and home governments in the same manner as the audiencias\r\nin Spain brought about unity in provincial and national judicial\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AUDIENCIA OF MANILA (1583-1598).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conditions which determined the establishment of an audiencia in\r\nthe Philippines differed little, if at all, from those in Spain's\r\nother colonies. All of Spain's dependencies were situated at great\r\ndistances from the mother country; the Philippines were farther away\r\nthan any. Furthermore, the Philippines were isolated and could not\r\nbe successfully maintained, if dependent on, or identified with any\r\nother colony; distance and other factors which we shall note made\r\nundesirable and impracticable a continuance of established relations\r\nwith New Spain. If, however, the governor of the Philippines came\r\nto be almost absolute in his authority, his absolutism differed in\r\ndegree rather than in kind from that of the governors and viceroys\r\nof other colonies. The contiguity of China and Japan, the constant\r\ndanger of military invasion and naval attack by outside enemies and\r\nthe dependence of the colony on the commerce of China also made the\r\ncase of the Philippines somewhat different from that of the colonies\r\nin America. In general, the situation in the Philippines called for a\r\ndistinct audiencia with the same powers and functions as were exercised\r\nby the audiencias of the other colonies.\r\n\r\nA system for the administration of justice in the Philippines had\r\nbeen definitely established and organized before the audiencia\r\nwas inaugurated in 1584. Many prominent features of the judicial\r\nand administrative systems of Spain and America had been already\r\nintroduced into the Islands. At the head of both judicial and\r\nadministrative affairs was the governor and captain-general, who\r\nwas practically absolute, and whose authority was  final except\r\nin certain matters of litigation which could be appealed to the\r\nAudiencia of Mexico. Subordinate to him were the alcaldes mayores\r\nand corregidores, whose functions have been already noted. In the\r\nPhilippines, as elsewhere, the latter officials acted as magistrates\r\nand governors of provinces, combining judicial and administrative\r\nattributes. Directly subordinate to them were the encomenderos, whose\r\nholdings, including lands and Indians, may be said to have constituted\r\nthe unit of the Spanish colonial land system until the close of the\r\neighteenth century. [48] As in Spain, so in the Spanish towns of the\r\nPhilippines, there were alcaldes ordinarios, or municipal judges,\r\nelected by the citizens in some cases, or appointed by the governor\r\nin others. [49]\r\n\r\nBut the system as established was defective in many respects. The\r\ngovernor and captain-general was chief judge, executive, and\r\ncommander of the military forces. In him were centralized all the\r\nfunctions of justice and government, exercised in the provinces\r\nthrough the alcaldes mayores and corregidores. The latter officials\r\nhe appointed ad interim, supervised their administrative duties,\r\nand heard judicial cases appealed from them. He likewise exercised\r\nsupervision over the oficiales reales, who were entrusted with the\r\ncollection, care and expenditure of the funds of the colony. [50]\r\nDuring the period before the establishment of the audiencia, the\r\ngovernor exercised complete control over all branches and departments\r\nof the government,--provincial, municipal, and insular--in matters\r\nof justice, administration, and finance. The centralization of\r\nall this authority in the person of one official made his position\r\nresponsible and powerful, but capable of much abuse. And it was the\r\nabuses incidental to the exercise of absolute power by the governor\r\nthat led to the establishment of the Audiencia of Manila.\r\n\r\nProbably the most important indirect reason for the establishment\r\nof an audiencia in the Philippines may be noted in the abuses\r\nconnected with the administration of the encomiendas. These may\r\nbe attributed both to the powerlessness and inefficiency of the\r\ngovernors, and to their cupidity and deliberate favoritism to the\r\nencomenderos. As a result of the rapid spread of these encomiendas,\r\n[51] settlements, or agricultural estates, for such they were,\r\nand their location in distant and widely separated parts of the\r\nArchipelago, the encomenderos came to have increased responsibilities\r\nand powers. They were far removed from the central authority at\r\nManila. They were infrequently inspected by the alcaldes mayores\r\nand corregidores in whose districts they were situated. Indeed,\r\nthe encomiendas had spread so rapidly in the Philippines that the\r\ngovernmental machinery provided by Spain was unable to provide for\r\nthem. In 1591, for example, there were 267 encomiendas containing\r\n667,612 souls. These were supervised by twelve alcaldes mayores. [52]\r\nOne hundred and forty priests were provided to minister to this large\r\ncongregation of natives. The Philippine government, with an autocratic\r\nmilitary governor at its head, had been originally designed for one\r\nsettlement or province, and not for an extensive military possession,\r\ndistributed over a widely separated area, with insufficient means of\r\ncommunication and transportation. Under the conditions outlined above,\r\nthe encomenderos were permitted to forget the benign purposes for\r\nwhich they had been originally entrusted with the care and protection\r\nof the natives. The Indians on the encomiendas were reduced to the\r\ncondition of slaves. They were mistreated, overtaxed, overworked,\r\ncheated, neglected, flogged, and abused. [53] Their protectors had\r\nbecome their exploiters. The churchmen who were supposed to act as\r\ntheir guardians and spiritual aids were insufficient in number to\r\nrender effective service. Many of the latter served the interests\r\nof the encomenderos, and the latter were decidedly unfavorable to\r\nthe introduction of more priests. The local officials of government\r\nand justice were in most cases too far away to care for and protect\r\nthe natives, or even to visit the more remote encomiendas in their\r\ndistricts. Moreover, many of them were themselves encomenderos,\r\nperpetrating abuses on their own tenants, and accordingly little\r\ninclined to sacrifice their own interests for the protection of the\r\nnatives on other encomiendas. Finally, the governor, located at the\r\ndistant capital, was possibly ignorant of the real state of affairs;\r\nat any rate, he failed to enforce the laws which commanded humane\r\ntreatment of the natives, leaving to the encomenderos, the alcaldes\r\nmayores, and corregidores the administration of the provinces and\r\nthe supervision of the encomiendas. [54]\r\n\r\nEfforts had been made for the correction of these abuses and to\r\nbring about a more effective control of the encomiendas by the\r\ngovernor. Early in the history of the Islands the king had empowered\r\ngovernors and viceroys to grant encomiendas for life, with thirty\r\nyears' remission of tribute, to those who had participated in the\r\nconquest. Legaspi and Lavezares, the first two governors of the\r\nPhilippines, had given encomiendas without limit to favorites,\r\nrelatives, and friends; consequently, when Sande became governor,\r\nhe was obliged to direct much of his attention to the eradication of\r\nthe resultant evils, and he attempted to establish the encomiendas on\r\na profitable and honest basis. He dispossessed many of the holders\r\nof these large tracts, and reserved them for the crown, as royal\r\nencomiendas, thus creating a revenue for the newly established and\r\nfinancially embarrassed government. [55] Sande made royal many of the\r\nhitherto unprofitable encomiendas which had been in private hands. [56]\r\nOn account of these acts Sande became very unpopular in Manila, and\r\nso unpleasant were his relations with the residents that, having\r\nno protection or recourse, he was obliged to give up his command,\r\npractically driven from the Islands by his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe only person in the Philippines who exercised any sort of check\r\non the governor was the bishop, with whom he was ordered to consult\r\nfrequently. These consultations were often productive of bitter\r\nquarrels. The first prelate of the Philippines, Bishop Salazar,\r\narrived in 1581, and throughout his ecclesiastical administration\r\nexercised influence of a far-reaching character. It was he who first\r\nshowed the need of a royal audiencia to check the encroachments of\r\nthe governor on the prerogatives of the church, for the protection of\r\nthe natives, and for the safeguarding of the royal interests. Bishop\r\nSalazar was a determined opponent of Governor Sande, whom he accused\r\nof excessive indulgence in trade and the extortion of large sums\r\nfrom the encomenderos. On June 20, 1582, he wrote to the Council:\r\n\"if I were as rich as Governor Sande, I would engage to pay any sum of\r\nmoney.\" He also testified that \"the government here is a place for the\r\nenrichment of governors; they carry away as much as 400,000 ducats,\r\nknowing that they will have to pay a share of it at the residencia,\r\nbut they steal enough to do that also.\" [57]\r\n\r\nThe government of the Philippines, prior to the establishment of the\r\nAudiencia of Manila, during the period 1565-1584, was subordinate\r\nto the viceroy and to the audiencia in Mexico. The time required\r\nfor the transmission of documents and correspondence, the fewness of\r\nships available for the voyage between the Philippines and New Spain,\r\nand the unsatisfactory means of communication resulting therefrom,\r\nseriously inconvenienced the residents of the colony. In matters\r\nof government and justice appeals had to be taken to Mexico. This\r\nproceeding involved great loss of time and expense, and was especially\r\ninimical to the administration of justice. The assignment and\r\nregulation of encomiendas, the supervision of financial affairs,\r\nthe control of the Chinese trade, the dispatch of the galleons to\r\nNew Spain, and the assignment of cargo-space on these ships, were\r\nall matters which, at that great distance, and at that time, called\r\nfor divided control. The execution of all these duties was too great\r\na charge for the human frailties of one man; the governor could do\r\nit neither honestly nor well. The necessity was apparent of having a\r\ncentral government in Manila which would be self-sufficient in itself;\r\nthat is, independent of New Spain, and at the same time capable of\r\nrepairing its own defects.\r\n\r\nThe relations which existed between the Manila government and\r\nthe authorities of New Spain are illustrated by a letter which\r\nGovernor Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa wrote a month later than\r\nthe correspondence above alluded to. In this letter he announced\r\nthe arrival of a ship from Mexico, which, he said, bore nothing\r\nbut charges against him. These complaints, he alleged, had been\r\nformulated by agents of Dr. Francisco de Sande, his predecessor,\r\nwhose residencia he had conducted and whom he had deprived of his\r\noffice as governor. Ronquillo wrote that\r\n\r\n\r\n    nevertheless, Sande has been received in that royal audiencia of\r\n    Mexico as oidor, as a result of which all those who love justice\r\n    may well despair. They meddle with my government from Mexico,\r\n    giving orders to my corregidores without consulting me, and\r\n    addressing private individuals in regard to the supplies, directing\r\n    them to keep watch over this or that matter; they impose grave\r\n    penalties upon me, and no matter how small the affair may be, they\r\n    refuse to listen to me or to hear my side of the question. [58]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe concluded by pointing out the inconsistency of his position,\r\nsubject as he was to Sande, the man whom he had displaced because\r\nof the former's unfitness to occupy the post of governor. Although\r\nGovernor Ronquillo de Peñalosa did not ask for an audiencia on this\r\noccasion, he did petition for an educated assistant to aid him in the\r\nadministration of justice. \"The trouble here,\" he wrote to the king,\r\nin the letter above quoted, \"is that the people are of such a nature\r\nthat, at the same time when justice is done to one, an enemy is made\r\nof another person.\" The rule of Ronquillo de Peñalosa as governor was\r\ndistinctly typical of the possibilities of an absolute executive, far\r\nremoved from the restraining influence of the courts, with scarcely\r\nany limitation upon his operations. Appointed as he had been for\r\nlife, with proprietary attributes, and with the power of naming his\r\nsuccessor, Ronquillo de Peñalosa was the first governor sent out from\r\nSpain in pursuance of the policy of entrusting frontier commands to\r\nmilitary men who were fitted by profession and experience to deal with\r\nsituations which demanded the qualities of the soldier, rather than\r\nthose of the administrator and politician. An attempt thus seems to\r\nhave been made to remedy the ills which had been characteristic of the\r\nadministration of Lavezares and Sande by entrusting the governor with\r\nmore centralized power--an attempt to correct the evils of absolutism\r\nwith the mailed fist and more absolutism, backed by military power.\r\n\r\nThe bishop, who at this time kept the court well informed of the\r\nweaknesses of the government, as they appeared to him, sent many\r\ncomplaints against Ronquillo de Peñalosa, as other churchmen had\r\ndone against former governors. Not only did the bishop himself write\r\nrepeatedly, but he influenced the municipal and ecclesiastical chapters\r\nof Manila to send protests against the governor's misrule. It was\r\nlargely owing to Salazar's influence that Captain Gabriel de Rivera\r\n(or Ribera) was sent to Spain with a petition signed by most of the\r\ninfluential men of the colony, asking for various reforms. Among these\r\nthe establishment of a royal audiencia was especially requested. [59]\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of Ronquillo's death in 1583, the bishop called\r\nattention to the straits into which the colony had fallen as a\r\nresult of the tyrannical methods of the deceased governor. [60] He\r\ndescribed Ronquillo's efforts to prevent residents from appealing to\r\nthe audiencia and viceroy of New Spain. He stated that the Indians\r\nhad been unjustly treated by the encomenderos and alcaldes mayores,\r\nfor when appeals had been made to the governor, the latter, on a\r\nplea of being too busy to occupy himself with such minute details,\r\nhad ordered the alcaldes mayores to settle the questions at issue\r\nwithout disturbing him. Ronquillo was said to have engaged extensively\r\nin commerce, monopolizing the ships to the exclusion of the merchants,\r\nand forcing large loans from the officials and residents, who did not\r\ndare to refuse him, lest all their privileges be taken from them. He\r\nhad established private encomiendas in nearly every town in Luzon,\r\nappropriating the income therefrom, instead of turning the proceeds\r\ninto the royal treasury. [61] This the prelate conceded to be in\r\naccordance with the conditions of the governor's appointment, but\r\nit was nevertheless unjust, as the privilege of holding encomiendas\r\nwas denied to other officials, and the treasury of the colony was in\r\nneed of the revenue which had been daily enriching the governor. The\r\nbishop accused the governor of seizing Indians, placing them en\r\nencomienda wherever and whenever he found them, irrespective of\r\nwhether they were already free, or whether they belonged on other\r\nencomiendas. These acts, he said, had caused the Indians to be\r\ndissatisfied and rebellious, and he evidently was of the opinion that\r\na revolt was impending when he penned this memorial. \"Many times I\r\nhave prayed,\" he wrote, \"that God should close the natives' eyes\r\nin order that they may not see the weakness and the little power\r\nwith which we might resist them in case they should arise to put\r\ndown these evils.\" The bishop closed this memorial with a vigorous\r\nprotest against the continuance of the hereditary principle in the\r\nsuccession of governors in the Philippines. He made the general\r\nrecommendation that in the future governors should be appointed by\r\nthe king, with a view to securing men of administrative and executive\r\nability. He brought forth strenuous objections to the accession of\r\nthe ex-governor's nephew. Diego Ronquillo de Peñalosa, who was not\r\nfitted to occupy the post of governor. If the latter assumed the\r\ngovernment, the bishop could see nothing in store for the colony but\r\na continuation of the evil days which had been extant throughout the\r\nadministration of the elder Ronquillo, \"who had spent all his time\r\nin gathering wealth for himself by means of trade, shutting his eyes\r\nand ears to those who asked justice of him.\" Salazar expressed the\r\nopinion that \"had Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa spent as much of his\r\ntime in making conquests and discoveries as he had in making packages\r\n[of merchandise], the prosperity of the Islands and the general\r\nwelfare would have been his chief aim.\" [62]\r\n\r\nAlthough the decree establishing an audiencia in the Philippines\r\nwas promulgated before the above memorial reached court, there is no\r\nquestion but that the influence of Bishop Salazar did much towards\r\nbringing about the creation of a tribunal in the Islands. Indeed,\r\nSalazar has been given all the credit for this by more than one\r\nauthority. [63] While the bishop did exert an important influence\r\nin bringing about this change, the support which he received\r\nfrom residents of the colony was also of immense advantage. Many\r\nindividuals, aggrieved by the abuses of the executive, wrote\r\nvigorous complaints against \"the tyranny of an absolute governor,\r\nwho alone and unchecked, reserves to himself excessive power.\" Their\r\nletters emphasize the injustice of having appeals carried to Mexico,\r\n\"where the people of Manila never get their deserts, and where they\r\nsuffer on account of the distance.\" Various encomenderos had been\r\nwronged by the acts of the governor in dividing their encomiendas, and\r\nreducing the number of Indians thereon; they had appealed to Mexico,\r\nand after waiting over two years, had despaired of ever getting any\r\nreturn for the money and the time which they had spent in litigation\r\nat the distant capital. As a possible means of relief they requested\r\nthe establishment of a royal audiencia at Manila. [64]\r\n\r\nAnother person who exerted considerable influence toward the\r\nestablishment of an audiencia in the Philippines was Captain\r\nGabriel de Rivera, who went to Madrid for that purpose. He was\r\nthe first procurador general de las islas del poniente, and it was\r\nhis duty to represent at court the needs of the colony, and of its\r\ninhabitants. [65] Rivera acted as the personal agent of Salazar in his\r\nadvocacy of the establishment of an audiencia, and it was largely due\r\nto his efforts that the institution was established when it was. In\r\nhis memorial of February 16, 1582, Rivera criticized the existing\r\nadministration in the Philippines, the proprietary governorship, and\r\nthe control over commerce which the governor had exercised. The latter\r\nhad levied the almojarifazgo and other customs duties in defiance of\r\nthe royal cédulas forbidding them, and without consulting the wishes\r\nof the merchants or officials. Rivera alleged that the almojarifazgo\r\nand the alcabala were ruining the commerce of the Islands. [66]\r\nHis memorial treated extensively of the abuses which had occurred in\r\nthe administration of the encomiendas, and he pointed out numerous\r\ndefects in the judicial system of the colonies.\r\n\r\nHe suggested the establishment of a royal audiencia to consist\r\nof three judges, having criminal and civil jurisdiction, without\r\nappeal to any other tribunal than the Council of the Indies. The\r\naudiencia as outlined by him was to have administrative powers as\r\nwell as judicial; it was to govern as a commission, with a governor\r\nat its head, chosen for a term of six years. [67] This scheme, he\r\nsaid, if put into operation, would result in no increased expense\r\nto the crown or colony. He proposed the abolition of the three\r\noficiales reales, suggesting the substitution of three oidores in\r\ntheir places, thus extending the jurisdiction of the audiencia to\r\nmatters of finance. The new tribunal should likewise take cognizance\r\nof the assignment of encomiendas, and see that in all cases the royal\r\nwill was obeyed. The audiencia should exercise supervision over the\r\nalcaldes mayores in their relation to the encomiendas, with a view to\r\nremedying the existing abuses and seeing that justice was done to the\r\nIndians. The audiencia should hear cases appealed from the alcaldes\r\nmayores and corregidores instead of allowing these suits to be heard\r\nby the governor or sent to Mexico. Rivera also urged that there should\r\nbe a special defender of the Indians as a part of the audiencia. [68]\r\n\r\nEnough has been noted of the evils of the government as it existed\r\nbefore the establishment of the audiencia to understand the reasons\r\nfor the creation of the tribunal. The whole matter summarizes itself\r\nin the excesses of the governor, and the necessity of protecting\r\nall classes of society from his absolutism. These abuses called for\r\nthe establishment of a tribunal nearer than New Spain, which would,\r\nin a safe and expeditious manner, impose the necessary limitations\r\nupon the governor, insure an equitable collection and an economical\r\nexpenditure of the public revenue, and bring about particularly\r\nthe elimination of official corruption. It was desirable to protect\r\nthe merchant in his legitimate business, to insure stability in the\r\nrelations of church and state, and to obviate the existing evils in\r\nthe administration of the provincial governments. The latter meant\r\nthe assignment of encomiendas in accordance with the law to deserving\r\nindividuals instead of to friends and relatives of the governors, or\r\nto other prominent officials of the colony. It also meant that the\r\nnatives on these encomiendas should be protected from the rapacity\r\nof the encomenderos. It was realized that an effort should be made\r\nto insure the imparting of religious instruction to the natives\r\nin partial return for tribute paid by them. Finally, it meant the\r\nestablishment of a tribunal which would have power to enforce the\r\nlaw prescribing that the alcaldes mayores and corregidores should\r\nexercise faithful supervision over these matters which were within\r\ntheir jurisdiction. A tribunal was needed, not merely to hear such\r\nappeals as might come to it by process of law, but with authority to\r\nintervene actively in affairs of government, checking the abuses of\r\nthe governor and protecting the community from his absolutism.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to establish an independent audiencia in Manila\r\nwas opposed by the viceroy and audiencia of New Spain. The latter\r\ntribunal wrote a letter of protest to the Council of the Indies,\r\ndemanding that in matters of government and justice the colony of\r\nthe Philippines should continue to bear the same relations to the\r\nviceroyalty of New Spain as did Guadalajara. [69] Rivera answered\r\nthese objections in a special memorial, stating that the isolation\r\nof the Philippines alone justified the establishment of an audiencia\r\nand an independent government. He also pointed out that the nearness\r\nof Japan and China and the necessity of dealing with them required the\r\npresence of a sovereign tribunal in Manila. He asserted that the colony\r\ncould deal directly with the Council of the Indies more profitably\r\nthan through the Audiencia of Mexico. The latter mode of procedure\r\nwas indirect and cumbersome and it exposed litigants to the meddling\r\nof the oidores of Mexico in matters which they did not understand. [70]\r\n\r\nFinally, the Audiencia of Manila was established by decree of Philip\r\nII on May 5, 1583, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whereas in the interests of good government and the administration\r\n    of our justice, we have accorded the establishment in the city of\r\n    Manila in the Island of Luzon of one of our royal audiencias and\r\n    chanceries, in which there shall be a president, three oidores,\r\n    a fiscal, and the necessary officials; and whereas we have\r\n    granted that this audiencia should have the same authority and\r\n    preeminence as each one of our royal audiencias which sit in the\r\n    town of Valladolid and the city of Granada of these our realms,\r\n    and the other audiencias of our Indies: now therefore we order\r\n    to be made and sent to the said Island our royal seal, with which\r\n    are to be stamped our decisions which are made and issued by the\r\n    said president and oidores in the said audiencia. [71]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the tribunal, it is to be noted, extended\r\nthroughout the Island of Luzon and the rest of the islands of the\r\nArchipelago, as well as over \"the mainland of China, whether discovered\r\nor yet to be discovered.\"\r\n\r\nThe decree which provided for the foundation of the Audiencia of\r\nManila consisted of three hundred and thirteen sections. Although\r\nthe audiencia was subsequently abolished for a few years, it was\r\nre-established in 1598 and these articles were again utilized. It\r\nis therefore worth while to notice the most important provisions\r\nof the law of establishment, which was to serve as a foundation\r\nfor the audiencia during a period of approximately three hundred\r\nyears. The first thirty-eight sections were devoted to the creation\r\nof the tribunal, to a definition of its jurisdiction over civil\r\nand criminal cases, and to a determination of the proper method of\r\nprocedure in them. The audiencia was to have authority to try cases\r\nof appeal from gobernadores, alcaldes mayores, and other magistrates\r\nof the provinces; it also had jurisdiction over civil cases appealed\r\nfrom the alcaldes ordinarios of the city and original jurisdiction\r\nover all criminal cases arising within five leagues of the city\r\nof Manila. Appeals were to be tried by revista (review) before the\r\ntribunal. Cases of first instance (vista) were not to be tried in\r\nthe tribunal, excepting those to which the government was a party,\r\nor the above-mentioned criminal cases. The judgment of the audiencia\r\nwas usually to be final in ordinary suits, and always in criminal\r\ncases. Those involving the government, and civil suits exceeding a\r\ncertain value were appealable to the Council of the Indies. Notice of\r\nappeal to the latter tribunal had to be served within one year after\r\nthe objectionable decision was rendered, and the party appealing\r\nthe case was obliged to post financial bonds covering the expenses\r\nof suit in case the final judgment were not favorable to him. The\r\ndecision of the audiencia was to be executed in all cases, even\r\nthough an appeal to the Council of the Indies had been made. The\r\nprocedure followed in the chanceries of Valladolid and Granada was to\r\nbe enforced in the Audiencia of Manila except when the contrary was\r\nespecially ordered. Investigations might be made by one judge, but\r\nthe concurrence of two was necessary for all decisions involving the\r\nreversal of a former judgment, or in cases wherein a certain amount\r\nwas at stake. In the latter case, an assistant judge might be chosen\r\nfrom outside the audiencia to assist the regular magistrate.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was forbidden to act alone in the selection of judges\r\nof residencias or pesquisidores; it was commanded not to interfere\r\nwith governors of provinces, but it had the right, when, charges\r\nhad been made by private individuals, to conduct investigations of\r\ngovernors' official conduct. The audiencia was empowered to investigate\r\nthe judges of provinces. Magistrates were forbidden to hear cases\r\naffecting themselves or their relatives, and when a case involving\r\nmore than one thousand pesos was before the tribunal, and no oidor was\r\neligible to try it, an alcalde ordinario might serve in the place of a\r\nregular magistrate, with appeal to the Council of the Indies. Criminal\r\ncharges against the oidores were to be tried by the president, with\r\nthe assistance, if need be, of such alcaldes ordinarios as the latter\r\nmight select. No relative of the president or of an oidor could be\r\nappointed legally to a corregidor-ship or to an encomienda. Oidores\r\nwere eligible for appointment by the president from time to time to\r\ninspect the administration of justice and government in the provinces.\r\n\r\nOidores were forbidden to receive fees from or to act as advocates for\r\nany private person, and they could not hold income-yielding estates in\r\narable land or cattle. Oidores were forbidden to engage in business,\r\neither singly or in partnership, nor could they avail themselves\r\nof the compulsory services of Indians under pain of deprivation of\r\noffice. Any person could bring suit against an oidor. As noted above,\r\nsuch cases would either be tried by the president or by an alcalde\r\nordinario on the president's designation. Such cases might be appealed\r\nto the Council of the Indies.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia, according to the terms of its establishment, had\r\nextensive authority over matters of government. In case of the\r\ndeath or incapacity of the president, the audiencia was to assume\r\ncontrol of affairs, the senior oidor filling the post of president\r\nand captain-general, with special charge over military matters. Under\r\nsuch circumstances the administrative and executive functions were\r\nto be administered by the audiencia as a body. The governor, who was\r\nalso president of the audiencia, was ordered to make a complete report\r\nannually to the Council of the Indies on the state of the government\r\nand the finances of the colony, including an account of the gross\r\nincome and expenditures, a survey of conditions of the encomiendas\r\nand corregimientos, as well as a report on the conduct of officials,\r\nincluding oidores. In fact, all matters that came regularly under the\r\ncare of the executive were to be covered in the annual report of the\r\ngovernor and captain-general of the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe president was empowered to delegate the oidores, in turn, to make\r\ntours of inspection in the provinces. The magistrates, as visitors,\r\nwere to inquire into the character of service rendered by the alcaldes\r\nmayores in the administration of government and justice. They were to\r\nnote the state of the towns and their needs, the means taken for the\r\nconstruction and preservation of public buildings, and the condition\r\nof the Indians on the encomiendas. They were to see whether they were\r\nfaithfully and efficiently instructed in religion, or whether they\r\nwere permitted to live in ignorance and idolatry. Reports were to\r\nbe made by the visitors on the state of the soil, the condition of\r\nthe crops and harvests, extent of mineral wealth and timber in the\r\nprovinces under investigation, weights and measures, and in fact,\r\neverything that had to do with the general welfare. On these trips\r\nthe oidores were authorized to take such action as they felt to be\r\nnecessary. Two oidores were also required to make weekly inspections\r\nof the prisons of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe decree of establishment also directed that certain phases\r\nof ecclesiastical affairs should claim the attention of the\r\naudiencia. The chief duty of the tribunal in that regard was to keep\r\nthe ecclesiastical judges from exceeding their authority, and the\r\npractices of the audiencias of Spain were especially prescribed as\r\na precedent for the local tribunal. The audiencia was charged with\r\nsupervision over the assignment of benefices, and especially with the\r\nsettlement of the property and estates of bishops and archbishops who\r\ndied in the Islands. The audiencia was ordered to permit nothing to\r\nbe done which would be in prejudice of the rights and prerogatives of\r\nthe church. The tribunal was instructed to assist the prelates on all\r\noccasions when they petitioned for royal aid. It was also to see that\r\nproperly accredited bulls were read and applied in the Spanish towns,\r\nbut not in the native villages.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, suits involving the royal treasury and the collection\r\nof money for the government were to be reviewed and decided before any\r\nother that might come up in the royal audiencia. It was the duty of the\r\nfiscal to prosecute these cases in the interest of the government. At\r\nthe beginning of each year the president and two magistrates were to\r\naudit the reports of the oficiales reales, and if these reports were\r\nnot duly and properly rendered, the salaries of these officials were\r\nto be withheld. After auditing the accounts the committee was to count\r\nthe money in the royal treasury. The oidores who did this extra work\r\nwere to receive an allowance of twenty-five thousand maravedís (about\r\n56 pesos) in addition to their regular salaries. The authorization of\r\nthe audiencia was necessary for the payment of extraordinary expenses\r\nnot appearing in the regular budget and these disbursements were\r\nmade subject to the later approval of the Council of the Indies. The\r\naudiencia was held responsible in these matters by the Council. Full\r\nreports of expenditures made on the responsibility of the audiencia\r\nwere to be made to the Council, and the oidores were held accountable\r\nin their residencias for their votes cast in the junta or acuerdo de\r\nhacienda, as the committee was called.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was given supervision over the administration of\r\nthe estates of deceased persons; it was to examine the accounts of\r\nexecutors and see that the wills of the deceased were faithfully\r\nexecuted and that all was done in accordance with the law. For this\r\npurpose an oidor was delegated each year with authority to dispose\r\nof these cases in the name of the audiencia. In a subsequent chapter\r\nthe duties and activities of this administrador or juez de bienes de\r\ndifuntos will be enlarged upon.\r\n\r\nConsiderable space in this decree was devoted to prescribing the\r\nrules for the trial of cases involving Indians, with a view to\r\nsecuring justice both in their administration by the encomenderos\r\nand in the supervision which the alcaldes mayores exercised over the\r\nencomenderos. The provision was made that \"our said president and\r\noidores shall always take great care to be informed of the crimes\r\nand abuses which are committed against the Indians under our royal\r\ncrown, or against those granted in encomiendas to other persons by\r\nthe governors.\" The audiencia was directed to exercise care that\r\n\"the said Indians shall be better treated and instructed in our Holy\r\nCatholic Faith, as our free vassals.\"\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was required to exercise care that suits involving\r\nIndians were neither lengthy nor involved, that decisions were\r\nreached promptly and without unnecessary litigation, and that the\r\nrites, customs, and practices to which the Indians had always been\r\naccustomed should be continued in so far as was practicable. The\r\naudiencia and the bishop were to see that there was a person appointed\r\nin each village to give instruction in religion. Alcaldes mayores were\r\nordered not to dispossess native chiefs of their rule or authority;\r\nthey were, on the contrary, to appeal cases involving them without\r\ndelay to the audiencia, or to the visiting oidor. The audiencia was\r\nto devote two days a week to hearing suits to which Indians were\r\nparties. Encomenderos were to be protected by the audiencia in the\r\npossession of their encomiendas.\r\n\r\nA proportionate amount of attention in this cédula is devoted to\r\noutlining the duties of the fiscal, who, from many points of view, was\r\nthe most important official directly connected with the tribunal. It\r\nwas his function to appear as prosecutor for the government in all\r\ncases tried before the audiencia, and he was forbidden to serve as the\r\nadvocate of any private person during his term of office. He should\r\ndevote his attention especially to matters involving the exchequer. He\r\nwas to prosecute all cases of appeal from the alcaldes mayores and\r\ncorregidores on behalf of the government, and \"he was to take care\r\nto assist and favor poor Indians in the suits that they have, and to\r\nsee that they are not oppressed, maltreated, or wronged.\" The fiscal,\r\nordinarily, was not to prosecute unless it were on the complaint of\r\nsome person, but in cases of notorious injustice, or when judicial\r\ninquiry was being made, he could take the initiative on his own\r\naccount. It was his duty to perform any and all legal acts which were\r\nconsistent with his position, and which were designed to bring about\r\njustice or to secure the royal interests.\r\n\r\nThe remaining sections of this decree, and, in fact, the greater part\r\nof it, are devoted to establishing the duties of the fiscal and the\r\nminor officials of the audiencia, to fixing a tariff of fees to be\r\ncharged for notarial and other legal work and to the determination\r\nof other matters which are of no great consequence to the purposes\r\nof this chapter.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor officials attached to the audiencia were the alguacil\r\nmayor and his two deputies. These were to act as the executive officers\r\nof the court and were empowered to make arrests, serve papers and\r\nexecute similar functions. Their duties, as a whole, were much like\r\nthose of the English or American constable or sheriff. They might\r\narrest, on their own initiative, persons whom they caught in crime, as,\r\nfor example, those playing forbidden games of chance, or indulging in\r\nimmoral practices, typical particularly of the Chinese. The alguacil\r\nwas responsible for the maintenance of the prison of the audiencia;\r\nfor this purpose he could appoint a certain number of jail-wardens.\r\n\r\nThere were also clerks of court and notaries, chosen by royal\r\nappointment. Their duties were those customarily required of such\r\nofficials, not differing from those of today. The audiencia likewise\r\nhad official reporters, similar to the court reporters of the present\r\nday. Advocates and attorneys practicing before the audiencia had\r\nto fulfill certain prescribed requirements in regard to learning,\r\ntraining, and general ability. Receivers, bailiffs, jail-wardens and\r\ninterpreters each received their due amount of space and attention\r\nin this cédula. The interpreters were to assist the Indians who\r\nwere defending themselves in a Spanish-speaking court. Among their\r\nduties was the translation of the testimony of witnesses, of the\r\nquestions of attorneys and the rulings of the courts into the native\r\ndialects, or into the Spanish language, as the circumstances might\r\nrequire. These interpreters were also required to assist the natives\r\nin the formulation of legal documents. All these minor officials were\r\nto be regulated in the collection of fees by a legal tariff. Finally,\r\nthe audiencia was provided with an archive within which were to be\r\ndeposited and kept the great seal of the government, and all official\r\npapers, including records of cases and official acts.\r\n\r\nThe new audiencia having been provided for, Santiago de Vera, the\r\nrecently appointed governor and captain-general of the Islands and\r\npresident of the new tribunal, arrived at Manila on May 28, 1584. In\r\naccordance with the new law, it was his duty to govern the Philippines\r\nin the capacity of executive and military commander, and at the same\r\ntime preside over the audiencia in its respective judicial, advisory,\r\nand administrative capacities. The first session of the audiencia was\r\nheld on June 15, 1584. [72] The new tribunal was officially brought\r\ninto being with much pomp and ceremony, including a procession of\r\nthe president and magistrates in their robes of office, and the\r\ncelebration of divine service in the cathedral by the bishop. The\r\npresident and each of the oidores subsequently made lengthy reports\r\nto the Council of the Indies on the inauguration of the tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe most direct and striking consequence of the establishment of\r\nthe audiencia in Manila was the discord which it engendered between\r\nthe various officials and functionaries of the government. Whereas,\r\nbefore the inauguration of the tribunal, the chief ill of the colony\r\nhad been the unrivaled absolutism and the high-handed proceedings\r\nof the governor, now, with the division of power newly effected,\r\nthe creation of new departments, and the checking of one official\r\nagainst another, strife and contention took the place of despotism.\r\n\r\nThere were but few misunderstandings between the oidores over their\r\njudicial duties. The functions of the audiencia, as a court, were\r\nclearly defined and distinctly understood. Although appeals were\r\nmade from the audiencia to the Council of the Indies, as appeals\r\nare always made from a minor court to a superior tribunal, there\r\nwas little dissatisfaction with the body in the exercise of its\r\npurely legal functions. Its value in protecting the natives on\r\nthe encomiendas from the tyranny of their masters, the facility\r\nrendered to the administration of justice by making appeal to New\r\nSpain unnecessary, and the advantage of having immediately at hand\r\na tribunal with plenary powers were readily recognized.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to the tribunal developed as a result\r\nof the audiencia's interference in matters of government and\r\nadministration. Disputes arose between the governor and the oidores,\r\nand among the oidores themselves. The lack of experience in the\r\nlocal field of the president and magistrates may have been one of\r\nthe causes of the unsatisfactory conditions immediately following\r\nthe establishment of the audiencia. Another and possibly a more\r\nimportant reason lay in the nature and wording of the articles of\r\nestablishment. A certain amount of confusion existed in the minds\r\nof all as to the extent of power which the audiencia should have in\r\ngovernmental and ecclesiastical affairs. No definite distinction had\r\nbeen drawn between the powers of the president and those of the oidores\r\nin matters of government, and the former at once accused the latter\r\nof infringing upon the jurisdiction of the executive. The oidores,\r\non the other hand, claimed that their advice should be taken in all\r\nmatters of appointment, defense, patronage--both ecclesiastical\r\nand secular--finance, commerce and interior administration. They\r\nbegan to intervene actively in those matters, to the displeasure\r\nof the governor and treasury officials. All the oidores as well\r\nas the fiscal, wrote lengthy memorials and reports to the king,\r\noffering advice on this affair or that, and criticising the governor,\r\nthe bishop, and the oficiales reales for acts done within their own\r\nspheres of authority. In sending these reports and in making these\r\nsuggestions, the magistrates did not question their own authority and\r\nthey resented exceedingly the objections and charges of interference\r\nby those concerned.\r\n\r\nAn illustration may be noted in the letter written on July 3, 1584,\r\nby Oidor Melchoir Dávalos to the king. After several clear intimations\r\nthat he would like to be governor in case a vacancy should arise\r\nand after modestly setting forth his own qualifications and virtues,\r\nDávalos wrote a faithful and vivid account of the expeditions which\r\nhad been made recently against the Mohammedan Sulus. He petitioned\r\nfor a suspension of the law forbidding slavery in order that Spaniards\r\nmight avail themselves of captive Moros as slaves. [73] He made several\r\nrecommendations in regard to the Chinese, stating particularly that he\r\nwas devoting himself to a study of the kind of government best fitted\r\nfor the Chinese in Manila. He complained that the Chinese merchants\r\nwere draining the Islands of silver, bringing as many as thirty-four\r\nshiploads of Chinese cargo a year. Since nothing of commercial value\r\nwas produced in the Philippines, they could take away nothing else\r\nthan silver. This incessant drain on the coin imported from Acapulco\r\nwas resulting in the impoverishment of the colony and constituted a\r\nsource of danger to New Spain as well. The exportation of money was\r\ncontrary to royal orders and distinctly prejudicial to the economic\r\ninterests of the realm. Dávalos recommended immediate action in the\r\nmatter. He then discussed military affairs, alleging that the pay of\r\nthe soldiers was insufficient, and their condition miserable. The first\r\nand third of the matters touched upon by the oidor in his memorial,\r\nnamely, the war in Mindanao and the condition of the soldiers, belonged\r\nto the private jurisdiction of the governor and captain-general,\r\n[74] the control of the Chinese coming later under the jurisdiction\r\nof the governor, as captain-general, with special inhibition of the\r\ninterference of the audiencia. [75]\r\n\r\nThis letter furnishes a good illustration of the interference of an\r\noidor in matters of government. The desire to interfere does not\r\nseem to have been confined to one individual, but was apparently\r\ncharacteristic of all the magistrates of the audiencia. [76]\r\n\r\nThe extensive field over which the oidores claimed cognizance is\r\nshown by a series of memorials which were sent by the audiencia as\r\na body to the court under the date of June 26, 1586. [77] They are\r\nnoted here because they illustrate the diversity of the interests of\r\nthe oidores, and because their devotion to these various matters was\r\ncharacterized as unjustified meddling by the governor and the other\r\nopponents of the audiencia. The concern which the oidores manifested\r\nin the miscellaneous affairs of government constituted, no doubt,\r\nan indirect reason for the temporary removal of the tribunal in 1589.\r\n\r\nThese memorials suggested reform in many departments of government. The\r\ninadequate state of defense and the demoralized condition into which\r\nthe garrison had fallen was the subject of one letter. Attention was\r\ncalled to the necessity of obtaining more funds for the fortifications\r\nof the Islands. Reference was made to the continual danger of Japanese\r\ninvasion. Another letter dealt with financial affairs. The public\r\nexchequer was reported to be in bad condition, as there was not\r\nenough money in the treasury to pay the expenses of government. The\r\noidores recommended that their own salaries should be paid out of the\r\ntreasury of Mexico. They suggested an increase of tribute as a means\r\nof securing more money. This, they alleged, could be done in justice,\r\nsince the amount of tribute paid by the natives of the Philippines\r\ndid not equal that levied upon the Indians of New Spain. [78] The\r\noidores reported an increase of 5000 pesos in the revenues of the\r\ncolony as profits from the sale of certain offices which had formerly\r\nbeen bestowed gratis by the governor upon his friends, the righting\r\nof this wrong being effected through the influence of the fiscal and\r\noidores who officiated as members of the junta de hacienda.\r\n\r\nWhile ostensibly seeking means for the enlargement of the income of\r\nthe Islands, as noted, the oidores protested against a recent royal\r\norder which had required that the proceeds returned from vacant\r\nencomiendas should be placed in the public treasury. They objected\r\nthat this would take away all hope of reward from soldiers and subjects\r\n\"who have served your Majesty, reducing them to poverty, with no means\r\nof support after a long career of service.\" [79] In other words, the\r\naudiencia is here seen registering its objections to the conversion\r\nof private into royal encomiendas, notwithstanding the fact that this\r\nwould mean greater revenue for the government. The inconsistency of\r\nthis attitude was pointed out by Magistrate Dávalos in his letter of\r\nJune 20, 1585. [80]\r\n\r\nAnother petition which may reflect some discredit upon the audiencia\r\nwas one which asked for the abolition of the one and one-half per\r\ncent tax on imported money, and for the elimination of the three per\r\ncent almojarifazgo. Both of these taxes bore heavily on the Chinese\r\nand on the Spanish merchants of Manila. \"These two taxes,\" wrote\r\nthe oidores, \"are drawing the life-blood from the Chinese, who would\r\notherwise bring products of great value to our shores.\" The oidores\r\nhad commenced this memorial by showing the financial needs of the\r\ncolony. They had requested assistance from the treasury of Mexico,\r\nyet, in the same communication, they proposed to abolish three of\r\nthe most profitable sources of colonial revenue that existed. These\r\nrecommendations not only illustrate the wide sphere of influence of\r\nthe magistrates, but they also seem to confirm the allegations which\r\nwere often brought against them, charges, indeed, which they proffered\r\nagainst one another--that each was more interested in trade than in the\r\nwelfare of the government. Notwithstanding the fact that the economic\r\nlife of the colony depended on the Chinese trade, the evidence seems\r\nto indicate that, even this early in the history of the tribunal, its\r\nmagistrates had personal interests to serve. In the letter referred\r\nto above, Dávalos, who seems to have been a dissenting party to all\r\nthese proceedings, charged his contemporaries with being guilty of\r\nundue mercantile activity.\r\n\r\nIn this same memorial the oidores warned the Council against the\r\nPortuguese influence in China, deploring the existence of Macao as\r\na rival to Manila as a trade emporium in the Orient. The audiencia\r\nwarned the court against the influence and operations of Pedro\r\nUnamanú, the successor to Captain Gali, who had gone to China and\r\nMacao, supposedly to take on a cargo of Chinese silks. This was\r\nin defiance of the law which forbade Spaniards to trade in China,\r\nand it was also contrary to the instructions of the viceroy and\r\naudiencia of New Spain. In this connection the oidores stated that\r\nthey had recommended to Governor Santiago de Vera that Unamanú should\r\nbe arrested and punished for diverting his voyage in the interests\r\nof private trade. In accordance with the advice of the tribunal\r\nthe governor had sent orders to Macao, summoning the leader of this\r\nexpedition back to Manila; these instructions, however, the governor\r\nof Macao was unable to fulfill. [81]\r\n\r\nThis memorial shows that the oidores considered it to be their\r\nduty to inform the court fully as to the part which the audiencia\r\nplayed in this affair. The matter at hand constituted a question\r\nof disobedience of the law, and the Audiencia of Manila had done\r\nwhat it could to enforce it. The tribunal had assumed a role quite\r\nas important as that of the governor. The episode shows also that\r\nthe audiencia was consulted by the governor in this matter, which\r\nwas purely governmental. It would not be unfair to suggest that a\r\npotential factor in stimulating the oidores and merchants of Manila\r\nto prevent the voyage of Pedro Unamanú or the Portuguese to China for\r\ntrading purposes must have been the desire to safeguard the Spanish\r\ninterests in the Chinese trade, and particularly those of Manila,\r\nwhich were the sole reliance of the colony. It was essential that\r\nthis commerce should be prevented from falling into the hands of\r\nother individuals or nations.\r\n\r\nThis memorial also dealt with ecclesiastical affairs. In it was\r\nset forth the audiencia's arguments in certain contentions which\r\nthe tribunal had had with the bishop, illustrating the fact that\r\nthe audiencia was opposed not only by the governor but also by the\r\necclesiastical authorities. It appears that the king had formerly\r\ngranted to the church courts a large share of temporal jurisdiction\r\nin the Islands. This former concession now stood in the way of the\r\nroyal prerogative and caused endless conflicts between the civil and\r\necclesiastical judges. The audiencia took the ground that by virtue of\r\nits own establishment the authority of the church courts over civil\r\nmatters was at an end. This the prelate declined to admit. Attention\r\nwas also directed by the audiencia to the opposition which Bishop\r\nSalazar had manifested toward the claims advanced by the civil\r\ngovernment for extending its jurisdiction over all the non-Christian\r\ntribes, the bishop alleging that Pope Alexander VI had ceded authority\r\nonly over such Indians as had been christianized. [82]\r\n\r\nIn truth, the bishop had found after two years of conflict that the\r\npresence of the audiencia had not entirely solved the problems of\r\nadministration, but, on the contrary, had increased the complexity\r\nof many of them. He had differed seriously with the oidores on\r\nseveral occasions. The ministers had opposed him not only in the\r\nlarger questions of government and ecclesiastical administration,\r\nbut in matters of ceremony as well. This was more than the prelate\r\ncould endure. He appealed some of these disputes to the governor\r\nand that official, after having neglected these matters for a long\r\nperiod, finally referred them to the audiencia, which promptly made\r\nthe settlements in its own favor. [83]\r\n\r\nSalazar's influence went far toward bringing about the removal of the\r\ntribunal, as it had helped in causing its establishment in 1584. The\r\ncomplaints of the bishop against the audiencia brought forth a royal\r\nreprimand for carrying on continual disputes with the audiencia. The\r\nprelate defended himself against these charges in a memorial dated June\r\n24, 1590. [84] He stated that these petty matters of form and ceremony\r\nwere of no great consequence. He accused the governor of seeking to\r\nstir up discord between him and the audiencia. As a matter of fact,\r\nhe said, the relations between him and the audiencia were far more\r\nharmonious than they had been between the tribunal and the governor,\r\nand on many occasions he had been called in to settle disputes between\r\nthe functionaries of the civil government. \"It is well known,\" he\r\nwrote, \"within the city and outside of it, that had I not entered\r\nas mediator between the president and oidores there would have been\r\nno peace. It would not have been possible for me to mediate if there\r\nhad not been friendly relations between them and me.\" [85]\r\n\r\nThe unpopularity of the audiencia from 1584 to 1586 is proved by\r\nthe fact that practically all the authorities in Manila--mercantile,\r\necclesiastical, political, and even the magistrates themselves--united\r\nin recommending its recall. On June 26, 1586, a series of petitions\r\nwas directed to the Council from various personages and organizations\r\nof the city asking that the audiencia be removed. These included\r\nthe municipal cabildo, the bishop, the governor, certain military\r\nofficials, and, lastly, several oidores (all, in fact, excepting\r\nDávalos). These greatly regretted the mistake which had been made\r\nin the establishment of the audiencia, conceded that it had been\r\na failure, and represented that the financial burden which its\r\npresence had imposed had been too great for the colony to bear. [86]\r\nIt is certain that the continual conflicts which had resulted from\r\nthe presence of the audiencia had not produced a salutary effect on\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia itself wrote to the Council at the same time: \"There\r\nhas been in this tribunal, between the oidores and the president,\r\ncontinual misunderstandings as to jurisdiction, which we have decided\r\nto submit to your Majesty to ascertain whether precedence in these\r\nmatters belongs to the president or to the oidores.\" The Manila cabildo\r\nrecommended the re-establishment of the governorship with centralized\r\nauthority: the power to grant titles, offices and encomiendas, with\r\nexclusive authority over the latter. This would include the power of\r\nappointing encomenderos in the name of the king. The recommendation\r\nwas made by the cabildo that consultative authority in matters of\r\ngovernment should be conferred on the ecclesiastical and military\r\nofficials. It was also suggested that a defender of the Indians should\r\nbe appointed other than the fiscal, for the latter, by nature of\r\nhis office, was their prosecutor rather than their defender. It was\r\nthe current opinion, this memorial went on to state, that the local\r\nprelate should be restored to his former place as defender of the\r\nIndians, and that he should have authority to dispossess encomenderos,\r\nif necessity for such action arose.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that Oidor Dávalos was the only official\r\nof importance who would not join in these representations. He believed\r\nthat the audiencia was necessary to the prosperity of the colony, and\r\nthat, if properly controlled, it would prove beneficial. He believed,\r\nmoreover, that the governor was the chief element of discord in the\r\ncolony, and that his influence had rendered inefficacious the efforts\r\nof the audiencia to keep peace and to enforce the laws. In a letter\r\nto the king, [87] just a year before the memorial described above,\r\nDávalos had represented Governor Santiago de Vera as a schemer,\r\naiming to get absolute control of the government. De Vera, he said,\r\nhad gone so far as to influence the bishop and clergy to recommend,\r\nagainst their better judgment, the abolition of the audiencia. The\r\ngovernor realized that the tribunal was the one obstacle in the way of\r\nthe fulfillment of his designs and had used every possible means to\r\ndiscredit and humiliate the audiencia and its magistrates. Dávalos\r\nasserted that the appeal of cases to Mexico would inflict great\r\ninconvenience on the people of Manila. He renewed the argument that\r\nSpain should have some sovereign body at that great distance from\r\nthe mother country. He enlarged on the future possibilities of the\r\nconquest and rule of the entire Orient by Spain, pointing out the\r\nvalue of the Philippines as a base of operations. It was, therefore,\r\nof the greatest importance that the Islands should be provided with\r\nthe proper sort of government.\r\n\r\nDávalos was especially bitter in his denunciation of Governor De Vera,\r\nwho, he said, had even resorted to force in order to intimidate the\r\nmagistrates and had called a council of military officials on one\r\noccasion for consultation in matters of justice and government. The\r\ngovernor was accused of violating the laws which had forbidden\r\nofficials to hold encomiendas; he had given the best posts in the\r\ngovernment to relatives, and had completely set aside the judgments\r\nwhich Dávalos had rendered in his capacity as juez y administrador de\r\nbienes de difuntos. The audiencia had been powerless to oppose De Vera,\r\nlargely, Dávalos inferred, because a majority of the magistrates were\r\nunder his influence.\r\n\r\nHowever unfavorable were the above comments on the governor, the\r\npicture which De Vera drew of himself in a letter to Archbishop\r\nContreras, [88] at that time viceroy of New Spain, is exceedingly\r\ninteresting by way of contrast. In his own words, the governor had\r\ngrown \"old and worn\" in his Majesty's service. According to him, the\r\naudiencia was of no service to the government, and only a drawback,\r\nmaking his own duties as governor doubly heavy, especially \"since the\r\nCouncil [of the Indias] so poorly seconds my efforts ... everything\r\nconcerning the government and war in these islands depends on the\r\npresident. He must attend to everything punctually; and, in order to\r\ncomply with his Majesty's commands, he must pay over and spend from\r\nthe royal treasury what is necessary for the affairs of government\r\nand of war.\"\r\n\r\nHe complained that the audiencia had interfered with his administration\r\nof the finances and had suspended the payment of the drafts which\r\nhe had drawn on the treasury. He had no recourse on account of the\r\ndelay necessary before an appeal to the Council of the Indies could\r\nbe answered. He complained that the audiencia had meddled with affairs\r\nof government on trivial pretexts, rendering him practically powerless.\r\n\r\nDuring this period the internal troubles of the colony were\r\nsupplemented by the interference of the viceroy and audiencia in\r\nMexico. The latter had been reluctant to surrender their former\r\nauthority over the Philippines. There were conflicts of jurisdiction\r\nbetween the viceroy and the governor and between the two audiencias\r\nover a number of matters, among which affairs of a commercial nature\r\nwere preëminent. Both the authorities at Manila and those of Mexico\r\nclaimed jurisdiction over the galleons which plied between Manila\r\nand Acapulco. [89] Numerous protests were made during this early\r\nperiod against what was considered the unauthorized interference of\r\nthe Mexican authorities. Those in Manila felt that inasmuch as they\r\nhad an audiencia which was co-equal in power with that of New Spain,\r\nthey should be independent of the viceroyalty in all the affairs of\r\njustice, government, and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe combined memorials of the residents and officials of Manila, which\r\nwe have already noted, were presented at court by a new procurator,\r\nFray Alonso Sánchez. The latter, a Jesuit, was a churchman of high\r\nstanding, and his abilities were recognized both at Madrid and in\r\nRome. Besides carrying commissions from the secular officials, he\r\nrepresented the bishop, but the latter, distrustful of the influence\r\nat court of a Jesuit commissioned by the secular government, with\r\nwhich the prelate was constantly at war, determined to send one of\r\nhis own supporters to Spain to represent his interests. The emissary\r\nof Salazar was Fray Francisco Ortega, of the Augustinian order. Ortega\r\nfollowed Sánchez to Spain and rendered valuable service as procurator\r\nof his order at Madrid. [90]\r\n\r\nIn written memorials and in personal interviews with the king\r\nand with members of the Council of the Indies, Sánchez summarized\r\nall the arguments heretofore given, asking for the abolition of\r\nthe audiencia. The newness of the country, the sparseness of the\r\npopulation and the poverty of the inhabitants, according to his\r\nargument, made such an institution a financial burden. If it were\r\ncontinued, the salaries of the magistrates would have to be paid\r\nfrom Mexico. An audiencia in Manila was not necessary, he urged,\r\nsince the chief element of the population was military, and hence\r\nunder martial law and jurisdiction. Even before the establishment\r\nof the audiencia it had been necessary to send but few cases to\r\nMexico; indeed, alleged Sánchez, lawsuits seldom arose in the colony,\r\nand the presence of the audiencia encouraged rather than prevented\r\nlitigation among the few merchants who lived in Manila. The discord\r\ncaused by the presence of the tribunal and the continual lawsuits\r\nwhich it encouraged among the Spaniards had a disquieting effect on\r\nthe natives, who had no need of such an institution, and who did not\r\neven understand its purposes. The audiencia, instead of serving as a\r\nprotection to the natives, was an instrument of tyranny. The Spaniards,\r\nunderstanding the use of a court which would enforce the contracts\r\nmade between them and the ignorant Indians, were often supported\r\nin the seizure of the latter's property, which act, in reality,\r\namounted to deprivation and legalized robbery. Sánchez stated that\r\nthe natives had been terrorized by the audiencia. The magistrates,\r\nversed in the legal customs and practices of Spain rather than of\r\nthe Indians, were unfit to administer justice in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nSánchez also emphasized the international phases of the audiencia's\r\nexistence in the Philippines, though with conclusions slightly\r\ndifferent from those which we have already noted. He stated that\r\nthe presence of the audiencia had caused the Portuguese, in China,\r\nformerly friendly, to be distrustful of the Spaniards, and this\r\nhad resulted in a considerable diminution of trade. This change of\r\nattitude he attributed to the wording of the cédula by which the\r\ntribunal had been created, extending its jurisdiction throughout the\r\n\"entire archipelago of China.\" Sánchez concluded his appeal with\r\nthe statement that some act was necessary to restore the confidence\r\nof the Portuguese, whose influence, exerted upon the Chinese, could\r\nspell ruin for Spain's Far Eastern colony. The cancellation of that\r\nclaim to China would remove all evidence of Spanish bad faith; it\r\nwould show to the Portuguese that the Spaniards had no desire to\r\nencroach on their rights, and through the restoration of commerce\r\nand prosperity the future of the colony would be assured. [91]\r\n\r\nSufficient has been presented to show that the audiencia, as\r\nestablished in 1584, was not a success. The chief objection to the\r\ntribunal was not its influence as a court; the real fault seems\r\nto have lain in the indefiniteness of the articles of establishment\r\nwhich gave it administrative powers, co-ordinate with the governor and\r\ncaptain-general. Almost every difficulty occurred in the administrative\r\nfield. The audiencia also failed to preserve harmony between church\r\nand state and added to these complexities by itself having dissensions\r\nwith the bishop. The petty character of the men who constituted this\r\nparticular government, their personal selfishness, and their eagerness\r\nto take advantage, in dishonest ways, of the time and the distance\r\nwhich separated the colony from the royal control, contributed to the\r\nfailure of the institution at that time. The audiencia was scarcely\r\nestablished, and it certainly did not have time to adjust itself to\r\nthe new conditions with which it found itself surrounded, before\r\nit was removed. It would seem that the authorities in Madrid were\r\nsomewhat hasty in withdrawing the audiencia, for it had proved its\r\nefficacy throughout the entire Spanish empire. The ill success of the\r\nAudiencia of Manila at this time does not prove that the institution\r\nwas a failure, or that its establishment was a mistake, for seven years\r\nlater it was returned and continued without interruption until 1898,\r\nand continues still as then reorganized. The statement of Philip II on\r\nNovember 25, 1595, \"that experience had proved it to be unnecessary\r\nin a land so new and unsettled\" [92] can hardly be justified in view\r\nof subsequent events.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the breakdown of the first audiencia may be found\r\nin the circumstances of the time, the personnel of the tribunal,\r\nthe indefiniteness of the laws which created it, the novelty of the\r\nsituation to magistrates and officials and their failure to adapt\r\nthemselves to their duties and to one another. As an institution\r\nof reform the audiencia did not have time to adjust itself to a\r\npermanent status.\r\n\r\nThe king, in compliance with the demands of the various organizations\r\nand individuals of Manila as communicated by their respective envoys,\r\nabolished the Audiencia of Manila by royal cédula on August 9, 1589,\r\nordering the Viceroy of New Spain to take the residencias of all\r\nofficials who had been identified with the Manila government. To\r\ncarry out these orders Licentiate Herver del Coral was sent from\r\nMexico to Manila, where he arrived in May, 1590, in company with\r\nthe new governor, Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas. [93] Santiago de Vera,\r\nthe ex-governor, was promoted to a magistracy in the Audiencia of\r\nMexico; the oidor, Pedro de Rojas, was made teniente and asesor\r\nto the governor, while the former oidor, Rivera, and Fiscal Ayala,\r\nwere left without office. [94]\r\n\r\nThe regular organization for the administration of justice in the\r\nprovinces was left precisely as it had been when the tribunal was in\r\nexistence. The alcaldes mayores and the corregidores still functioned\r\nas judges of first instance and as governors of the provinces. The\r\nalcaldes ordinarios remained the judges of first instance in the\r\ncity of Manila. These judges tried cases with appeal to the governor,\r\nand the judgment of the latter was final in cases involving a value\r\nof a thousand ducats or less. Cases of a higher category might be\r\nappealed from the decision of the governor to the Audiencia of Mexico,\r\nand thence, if again appealed, to the Council of the Indies.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia of three magistrates and a fiscal was replaced by a\r\ngovernor, who was both captain-general and sole judge. He was assisted\r\nin the latter capacity, as above noted, by a teniente and asesor,\r\na lawyer, who advised him in legal affairs and prepared his judicial\r\ndecisions for him. This reform was made on the representation of Fray\r\nSánchez, that Manila had no need of a judicial system more pretentious\r\nthan that of any Spanish provincial town. That city was accordingly\r\nreduced to the rank of a city or district, with dependence in judicial\r\nand administrative matters on New Spain, in whose audiencia appeals\r\nfrom the governor of the Philippines were heard.\r\n\r\nWith these new reforms the leading authorities in Manila professed\r\nto be greatly pleased. Bishop Salazar, who was the most influential\r\nperson in Manila at this time, expressed his satisfaction to the\r\nking in a letter dated June 24, 1590. [95] He suggested, however,\r\nthat the continuance of the audiencia might have been satisfactory\r\ncould its members have been paid from the treasury of New Spain. He\r\nreported the arrival of the new governor, and stated that the latter\r\nhad already given evidence of a desire to govern wisely and justly.\r\n\r\nSalazar's optimism in regard to the good intentions of the governor\r\ncould not have been long continued, for Morga tells us that in the\r\nfirst year of the government of Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas the need of\r\nan audiencia was felt by many. [96] At that time, all the powers\r\nof government were centralized in the governor, and there was no\r\nimmediate authority to which the people could apply for relief. Salazar\r\nhad many disputes with the governor over questions relating to the\r\nrespective spheres of the church and state, and from the decisions of\r\nthe executive the prelate had no recourse. Dasmariñas, on reporting\r\nthese matters to the king, stated that the bishop had interfered in\r\nthe matter of the collection of the tribute, the government of the\r\nencomiendas, the Chinese trade (in which, the governor alleged that\r\nthe prelate had an unpriestly interest), and in the administration of\r\njustice. [97] The prelate had interpreted the removal of the audiencia\r\nas constituting a re-establishment of the concession formerly made to\r\nthe church of extensive control in the administration of government\r\nand justice. He claimed that ecclesiastical judges should have the\r\nsame civil jurisdiction as they had exercised before the audiencia\r\nwas first founded. This, of course, the governor would not tolerate.\r\n\r\nBishop Salazar was so displeased with the turn which affairs had\r\ntaken in Manila that he determined to leave the Islands, and passage\r\nbeing placed at his disposal by the willing governor, the bishop set\r\nout in July, 1592. [98] On his arrival in Spain, Salazar concerned\r\nhimself principally with religious matters, securing some valuable\r\nreforms. Among the latter was the erection of the Philippines into an\r\narchbishopric and the creation of three subordinate bishoprics. Salazar\r\nshowed the desirability of the restoration of the audiencia as a\r\npreventive check on the excesses of the governor, but this change\r\nwas not made as an immediate consequence of his recommendations.\r\n\r\nA cédula was issued on January 17, 1593, which outlined with more\r\ndefiniteness a judicial system for the Islands. This reform confirmed\r\nthe position of the governor as nominal head of the judiciary, with\r\njurisdiction over appeals from the lower courts, but it decreed that\r\nthese cases should be tried by a letrado. The governor's final and\r\nconclusive jurisdiction was extended to all cases not exceeding a\r\nthousand ducats in value. Cases of a greater value might be appealed\r\nto the Audiencia of Mexico. [99] The governor was given authority to\r\nname a protector of the Indians. [100]\r\n\r\nThe above changes were followed shortly by the cédula of August 18,\r\n1593, by which the title of teniente de capitán-general y asesor\r\nde gobernador y capitán-general de las Islas Filipinas was bestowed\r\non Don Antonio de Morga, who was probably the most efficient jurist\r\nand one of the most versatile officials that Spain ever sent to her\r\nAsiatic dependency. [101] Morga was at this time not only successor\r\nto the audiencia in judicial matters, but also attorney-general and\r\nsole legal adviser to the governor. His predecessor, Pedro de Rojas,\r\nwas transferred to Mexico, in pursuance of the idea, as alleged in the\r\norder of transfer, of removing from the Philippines all the members of\r\nthe old audiencia, so that the new scheme, as revised at that time,\r\nmight be allowed to work itself out without prejudice. Before his\r\ndeparture, the residencia of Rojas was conducted by Morga.\r\n\r\nEven the reforms of 1593 did not suffice to make the administration\r\nof justice satisfactory to all parties. From the large amount of\r\ncorrespondence which exists, embodying complaints against the harsh\r\nmethods of Dasmariñas and his successor, Tello, three letters may\r\nbe cited which show the attitude of the various officials of the\r\ncolony towards the re-establishment of the audiencia. The first of\r\nthese was written by Governor Dasmariñas himself, and it may be in\r\nsome ways surprising to note that he asked for the restoration of the\r\naudiencia. His reasons, in part, however, were different from those\r\nadvanced by his contemporaries. Dasmariñas was of the opinion that an\r\naudiencia would be effective in the nullification of the interdicts\r\nand excommunications imposed by the archbishop and the local prelates,\r\nwhich he claimed were working havoc with the civil government. [102]\r\n\r\nThe treasury officials complained that the absolute government of\r\nthe executive was contrary to the interests of real hacienda. Their\r\nobjections to the prevailing system were voiced in the second\r\nof the memorials alluded to above, that of Francisco de la Misa,\r\nfactor of the royal treasury of Manila. [103] Misa said that under\r\nthe former arrangement the audiencia had audited the accounts of the\r\nroyal treasury and of the city of Manila each year. In this way the\r\naccounts had been well kept and the funds properly accounted for. The\r\nremoval of the audiencia had left the governor with authority over\r\nthe nomination of the officials of real hacienda, as well as the\r\nsupervision of the accounts. Since Dasmariñas had been governor, no\r\naccounts had been rendered by the minor officials of the treasury,\r\nand, as a consequence, their superiors had been unable to make up\r\ntheir reports for the Contaduría of Mexico. The governor's attention\r\nhad been called to this deficiency repeatedly, but the latter had\r\ndisplayed no interest in the state of the colony's finances, which,\r\nsaid Misa, exceeded all other matters in importance. \"This comes,\" the\r\nfactor observed, \"from placing in charge of Your Majesty's finances a\r\nsoldier, unfitted to do else than command troops, and then unchecked\r\nby an audiencia, so far distant from your royal person.\" The laxity\r\nof the governor and of his subordinates seems to have resulted in\r\nthe loss of much revenue.\r\n\r\nMisa also showed that there had been many irregularities in the\r\nsale of offices, deficiencies which the presence of an audiencia\r\nwould have checked. Instead of selling the minor clerkships of the\r\nexchequer, the governor had given them to his friends. Two offices,\r\nwhich were by no means insignificant, those of the chief clerkships\r\nof government and of justice, respectively, had been sold formerly\r\nfor four thousand pesos each. The governor, however, had preferred\r\nto have them on his civil patronage list; this would not have been\r\npermitted had an audiencia been present to enforce the law.\r\n\r\nThe governor was charged by Misa with extravagance in the expenditure\r\nof the revenue of the colony. The payment of the salaries of new\r\nappointees to offices, friends of the governor, had made heavy drains\r\non the treasury. The king, by repeated cédulas, had forbidden the\r\ndesignation of an excessive number of alcaldes and corregidores because\r\nof the desirability of economizing the resources of the colony. While\r\nthe audiencia was in existence its consent had been necessary for\r\nthe creation of new judicial districts, but since the recall of the\r\ntribunal, the governor had trebled the number of provincial officials,\r\nand, in addition, had permitted each to have a salaried assistant.\r\n\r\nAccording to Misa, various other evils had resulted from the\r\nabsolutism of the governor, among which were numerous abuses which\r\nhe had tolerated in the galleon trade. It was alleged that Spanish\r\nmerchants in Mexico had sent money to agents in Manila, and in that\r\nway had caused the legal amount brought from Acapulco for investment on\r\nthe annual galleon to be exceeded. [104] This, the factor stated, was\r\ndue partially to the laxity and corruption of the Acapulco officials,\r\nwho had permitted the galleon to leave that port with more than the\r\nauthorized amount of money. The governor of the Philippines, however,\r\ncould have prevented this abuse had he been so inclined, as the\r\nships' manifests were always subject to his inspection on arrival\r\nat Manila. The money sent by the merchants of Mexico was invested\r\nin merchandise in the Islands and these goods were shipped back to\r\nAcapulco on the galleon, thus excluding the commerce of the local\r\nmerchants. The latter were growing poorer daily while the governor\r\nand his friends were waxing richer. The governor had also exercised\r\nfavoritism in the distribution of cargo space, thus rewarding his\r\nfriends and punishing his enemies. [105] Since the suppression of the\r\naudiencia these abuses had increased, as there had been no authority\r\nin Manila to hold the governor in check.\r\n\r\nThis memorial, from Misa, which was carefully considered at court,\r\nwent far toward demonstrating that the restoration of the audiencia\r\nwould have beneficial results, so far as the administration of real\r\nhacienda was concerned.\r\n\r\nThe third of the letters referred to as reflecting the attitude of\r\nthe Manila officials toward the re-establishment of the audiencia\r\nand ultimately contributing to its restoration, was directed to the\r\ncourt by Antonio de Morga, the efficient lieutenant-governor. Morga,\r\nas did Misa, placed great emphasis on the need in Manila of a more\r\nefficient system for the administration of the exchequer. Morga\r\nwas moderate in his characterization of the governor, alleging that\r\nDasmariñas had been brought completely under the influence of the\r\necclesiastics. He expressed the belief that an audiencia would aid\r\nin combatting what he termed the retrogression of the colony under\r\nthe influence of the priests. \"There should be someone,\" he wrote,\r\n\"to oppose the ecclesiastics in a land so far away from the Audiencia\r\nof Mexico; for, no matter what question is sent there for decision, at\r\nleast two years must elapse before despatches can be returned.\" [106]\r\nNo official was better qualified to explain the needs of the colony\r\nin matters of justice than Morga, for he was at that time, in reality,\r\nthe supreme court of the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia, after an interregnum of seven years, was restored\r\nby a cédula promulgated by Philip II, November 26, 1595. [107] The\r\ntribunal was to consist of a president, who should also be governor and\r\ncaptain-general, four oidores, a fiscal, and various subordinates. The\r\nhistory of the former audiencia and the reasons for its suppression\r\nand re-establishment are summarized in the cédula as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I established an audiencia in that city and province in order\r\n    that everything might be governed by means of it, and that justice\r\n    might be administered with the same universal equality, mildness,\r\n    and satisfaction desirable; after its establishment I ordered\r\n    it suppressed as experience proved it unnecessary in a land so\r\n    new and unsettled; in its place I sent a governor, and though his\r\n    administration was excellent, yet, inasmuch as that community had\r\n    grown, and I hope that it will continue to grow, I have thought\r\n    it advisable to found and establish the said audiencia again.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this cédula, which was addressed to Governor Tello, the king\r\npointed to the increased importance of the Philippines, and to the\r\nmany expeditions by which the Island of Luzón and other islands of\r\nthe Archipelago had become pacified and more densely settled. The\r\nincrease of commerce with the Chinese was also cited as a reason\r\nfor providing the Islands with a more stable government. It was\r\nstated that in the administration of justice there should be as much\r\nefficiency as possible without the loss and inconvenience involved\r\nin appealing cases to Mexico. The governor would have more time for\r\nhis increasing administrative and military duties if disengaged from\r\nhis former judicial functions. The cédula continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n    You [the governor] may find it advisable to have by you persons\r\n    with whom to take counsel, in order that matters may be considered\r\n    with the requisite conformity and by a sufficiently large body of\r\n    advisers; for these reasons I have decided to form an audiencia;\r\n    ... you shall be its president, holding that office with those\r\n    of my governor and captain-general. [108]\r\n\r\n\r\nTogether with this decree of re-establishment the king issued special\r\ninstructions to Tello, prescribing in detail the relations which the\r\ngovernor was to observe with the audiencia. These instructions, in\r\ngeneral, sought to prevent the recurrence of the misunderstandings\r\nwhich had been so fatal to the earlier tribunal. The governor and\r\noidores were ordered to co-operate in the formulation of commercial\r\nregulations, with a view, particularly, to securing the Chinese trade,\r\nin the enforcement of the pancada, [109] the consideration of ways and\r\nmeans to prevent money from passing to China, in matters of taxation\r\nand finance, encomiendas, and the pacification and government of\r\nthe wild tribes. By these instructions, it is important to note,\r\nthe function of advising the governor in administrative matters was\r\ndefinitely bestowed upon the oidores. \"Matters of importance,\" the\r\ncédula prescribed, \"the said president-governor shall discuss with the\r\noidores of the said audiencia, so that the latter, after consultation,\r\nmay give him their opinion.\" [110]\r\n\r\nThe governor and the magistrates were jointly charged to do all\r\npossible to discourage Indians and Spaniards from wasting their\r\nmeans in fruitless and petty lawsuits. The natives, according to\r\nthis new reglamento, should always be protected against the designs\r\nof those who would take undue advantage of them. The governor was\r\nmoreover instructed to confer with the archbishop and audiencia in\r\necclesiastical affairs, and the prelates were especially forbidden\r\nto excommunicate and issue declamations from the pulpit against the\r\nofficials of the civil government, such as were constantly proclaimed\r\nwhen Salazar was bishop. Priests were not to meddle with the civil\r\ngovernment, or with the pancada, or with any form of trade.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia as reformed, with the powers and duties noted, began\r\nits life in Manila on May 8, 1598. The inauguration of the tribunal\r\nwas attended with general rejoicing, and a celebration characterized\r\nby great formality and pomp. The royal seal was conducted through\r\nthe city in a procession which was composed of all the royal and\r\nclerical dignitaries. Church, state, and citizenry united in expressing\r\nsatisfaction at the restoration of the tribunal, with its consequent\r\nprospect of an efficient government and administration of justice.\r\n\r\nReforms were made in the scope and composition of the audiencia at\r\nvarious times during its existence. It developed from a commission\r\nof three magistrates, with a president at its head, with definite\r\nand ill-expressed powers over a vast archipelago, whose population\r\nwas sparse and scattered, to a double-chambered tribunal of appeal\r\nin second and third instance, with definite jurisdiction over a\r\nwell-organized commonwealth. It would be highly desirable, did space\r\nallow, to review chronologically the important reforms which were\r\nmade in the organization, scope and jurisdiction of the Audiencia of\r\nManila throughout its history. The most important of these, however,\r\nwill be noted incidentally in the following pages.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia, from the time of its renewal onward, typified and\r\nrepresented the royal authority, and its tenure was more continuous\r\nthan the governorship. Eight times subsequently did the audiencia\r\nassume the reins of government in lieu of the governor. It became\r\nthe most reliable channel through which the royal authority made\r\nitself felt in the Islands, and it was especially utilized by the\r\ncourt as a check on the governor. [111] Whenever occasion arose,\r\nthe audiencia interposed as the intermediary and arbiter between\r\ndissenting parties in the name of the sovereign, and its decrees were\r\nlistened to with respect. It was no longer a temporary organization,\r\nand so firmly established was it henceforth that no person seriously\r\nconsidered its recall a possibility. Through a period of three\r\nhundred years the audiencia exercised its functions. It was first\r\nand always a judicial body. It shared executive and administrative\r\nduties with the governor. It frequently exercised attributes of an\r\nadvanced legislative character. It participated in the government of\r\nthe provinces. It shared the authority of the royal patronage in the\r\ncontrol of ecclesiastical affairs. These various activities will be\r\nstudied in subsequent chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE AUDIENCIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was first and always a tribunal of justice. It was\r\nestablished for the purpose of trying cases and settling disputes. Had\r\nit no other functions than the purely judicial, however, it would not\r\nhave played the important part which it did in colonial administration\r\nduring two hundred years of its existence. Its chief interest to the\r\nstudent of history and government will not be so much its activity as\r\na judicial institution as the relations it bore to other departments\r\nof the government. Its extraordinary powers and functions developed\r\nincidentally at first through the establishment of the institution in\r\ncolonies where no other agency existed to deal with the unforeseen\r\nproblems and necessities which arose from time to time. The gradual\r\nassumption and exercise of non-judicial functions are therefore the\r\nchief characteristics to be noted in the history of the Audiencia\r\nof Manila.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this chapter, however, will be to study the audiencia\r\nin its capacity as a civil judiciary and to clear the way for the\r\ndiscussion in subsequent chapters of the wider, and from the present\r\nviewpoint, more notable fields of its activity. An effort will be made\r\nto describe its judicial procedure, the kinds of cases which it tried,\r\nthe limitations on its jurisdiction--what courts were inferior to it,\r\nand what authority was superior. This investigation will be made from\r\nthe viewpoint of the historian, rather than from that of the student\r\nof jurisprudence, subject to such limitations as a lack of knowledge\r\nof the law may impose. We shall first consider the procedure of the\r\naudiencia as authorized by the laws of the Indies, illustrating this\r\nprocedure by the citation of actual cases in practice.\r\n\r\nThe powers and duties of the Audiencia of Manila as defined in the\r\nspecial decree of establishment of May 5, 1583, have been set forth\r\nin the preceding chapter. By this decree the audiencia was granted\r\ncivil and criminal jurisdiction in cases of appeal from the lower\r\ncourts and original jurisdiction in those affecting the government,\r\nand the conduct of its officials. The authority of the audiencia in\r\nthe latter cases was exercised through the appeals which came to it\r\nfrom the special investigators and visitors who tried these officials\r\nin first instance.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Indies, after prescribing the time of meeting and\r\nthe hours of the daily sessions of the audiencia, made their first\r\nimportant judicial regulation by forbidding viceroys and presidents\r\nto assist in the determination of suits. Cases must be tried by the\r\nproperly qualified oidores, yet the president (viceroy or governor)\r\nwas to sign the decisions with the magistrates. [112] Unless the\r\npresident were a lawyer, he was even denied cognizance of military\r\ncases. The audiencia had jurisdiction over appeals from the viceroy or\r\ngovernor in all government matters to which any official or private\r\ncitizen might take exception. [113] In case of disagreement between\r\nthe audiencia and the president, it was prescribed that the question\r\nat issue should be carried to the Council of the Indies. In case the\r\nmajority of the audiencia agreed to follow a certain course of action,\r\nthe viceroy or president was forbidden to contravene or oppose that\r\naction. Instead, he was ordered to abide by it, appealing to the\r\nCouncil of the Indies for final settlement of the contention. [114]\r\n\r\nThere were many laws regulating the relations between the audiencia\r\nand the governor, most of which will be noted in greater detail\r\nin a subsequent chapter. The most important were the laws which\r\nordered that the viceroys of New Spain and Perú should leave to the\r\naudiencias entire jurisdiction over residencias, questions involving\r\nthe marriage relation [115] and the administration of property of\r\ndeceased persons. [116] A law especially referring to the Philippines\r\nordered the Audiencia of Manila to abstain from interfering with the\r\ngovernment of the Chinese in the Parián. [117] This did not forbid the\r\ntrial on appeal of cases relating to the Chinese, since in practice\r\nthe audiencia had authority to take cognizance of such cases. Certain\r\nextra duties were required of the oldest oidor of the audiencia, who\r\nwas known as the decano. He was given complete authority over the\r\ntribunal in the absence of the president. He might assign cases to\r\nthe magistrates, designate judges for special duties and determine\r\nall matters relating to the interior organization and government\r\nof the tribunal. These functions were assumed, after 1776, by the\r\nregent, and the prerogatives of the office of decano became merely\r\nnominal, except when the regent was absent. In audiencias whose size\r\npermitted it, the oldest oidor, or the regent, after that office was\r\ncreated, could determine whether sessions should consist of one or two\r\nsalas. [118] An audiencia was legally constituted, however, if only\r\none magistrate were present. [119] The audiencia was commanded to guard\r\nits proceedings with great secrecy, and such rules were formulated for\r\nits magistrates as would enable the tribunal to uphold its dignity,\r\nand command the respect of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nCases of first instance were tried by inferior judges who were\r\nbelow the category of oidores. [120] As noted in a former chapter,\r\nthese judges were the alcaldes ordinarios, alcaldes mayores, and\r\ncorregidores. The former tried civil and criminal cases in the towns\r\nand cities and the last two exercised extensive jurisdiction in the\r\nprovinces. Cases were appealed from them to the audiencia. [121]\r\nThe audiencia was forbidden to concern itself with cases of first\r\ninstance, excepting certain criminal suits which originated within\r\nfive leagues of Manila. [122]\r\n\r\nA separate sala, for the trial of criminal cases was created in the\r\naudiencias of Lima and Mexico. The magistrates serving in these salas\r\nwere designated as alcaldes del crimen. They had jurisdiction in\r\nfirst instance over the criminal cases arising within five leagues\r\nof the capital, as referred to above, and in second instance over\r\nthose appealed from the provincial judges. [123] The oidores in these\r\naudiencias confined themselves to civil suits, but in audiencias where\r\nthere were no alcaldes del crimen, the oidores were authorized to try\r\nboth civil and criminal cases. [124] The magistrates of the Audiencia\r\nof Manila had both criminal and civil jurisdiction, as that tribunal\r\nbelonged to the latter class. When the number of oidores present was\r\ninsufficient to do the work of the audiencia, alcaldes ordinarios\r\nor alcaldes mayores who had the necessary qualifications might be\r\ntransferred temporarily to the tribunal. When acting as oidores they\r\ncould not try cases over which they had formerly exercised original\r\njurisdiction. [125]\r\n\r\nA system of procedure was prescribed for the trial of cases before\r\nthe audiencia and the order fixed in which these should come up for\r\nconsideration. It was ordered that two slates should be kept, one for\r\ncases classified according to their importance and another for those\r\nto be tried by rotation. Cases of the first category and those which\r\nwere especially urgent might supersede the latter, but when there\r\nwere none of the former the second slate was to be adhered to.\r\n\r\nCases relating to real hacienda took precedence over all others. The\r\npresident was instructed to see personally that these cases should\r\nnot be subjected to delay and that at least one day a week should\r\nbe set aside for their adjudication. Next in importance were cases\r\ninvolving infractions of royal ordinances and laws. Probate cases\r\nwere given one day a week. Two days weekly were set aside for the\r\nconsideration of suits which arose between Indians and between\r\nIndians and Spaniards. Cases involving the poor, however, were\r\nto take precedence over these. The audiencia was made responsible\r\nfor the good treatment of the Indians and it was charged with the\r\nobligation of seeing that all suits to which Indians were parties\r\nshould be tried without loss of time. Delays resulting from the\r\ncarelessness of lawyers and from their eagerness to profit at the\r\nexpense of the natives were discouraged. Matters of slight importance\r\nwhich pertained to the Indians were to be dispatched by decrees of\r\nthe audiencias and viceroys; this provision was designed to avoid\r\ncontentious litigation, to which the natives were characteristically\r\ninclined. It also sought thereby to protect them from dishonest judges\r\nand lawyers. Any and all of the cases mentioned in this paragraph were\r\nconsidered to be of such importance that they were classified among the\r\nfirst to be tried and determined prior to those involving property,\r\ncommercial affairs, and ordinary transactions. Of the latter cases\r\nthose already decided were to be reopened before the hearing of new\r\ncases of the same class. Cases involving the poor were to be given\r\nspeedy consideration. [126] Length of waiting should be the criterion\r\nfor the consideration of the remaining cases.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was empowered to compel testimony from all persons and\r\nauthorities. [127] As already noted, the oidores of audiencias which\r\ndid not contain alcaldes del crimen were authorized to entertain\r\nappeals from persons who had been condemned to death. [128] The\r\nsame was true of all other criminal cases that were admitted to\r\nappeal. Members of religious and military orders were not exempted\r\nfrom the jurisdiction of the audiencia. [129]\r\n\r\nThe laws regulating the audiencia's jurisdiction in civil cases seem to\r\nhave varied according to the time and the policy of the government. The\r\naudiencia exercised both original and appellate jurisdiction, as we\r\nhave already noted. Most of the civil suits tried by the tribunal were\r\nappealed to it from inferior judges. A law was made in 1563 ordering\r\nthat cases involving less than twenty pesos might be tried by verbal\r\nprocess. [130] This law would seem to have excluded cases of less than\r\nthat value from appeal to the audiencia, as the processes had to be\r\ncommitted to writing in order to be appealed. The cédulas of November\r\n26, 1573, and August 10, 1574, fixed the minimum amount that might\r\nbe appealed at six pesos of eight reales, or 3000 maravedís. [131]\r\nCharles V in 1542 promulgated an important law for the regulation of\r\nappeals to the audiencia. It provided that the smallest amount that\r\nmight be appealed should be 300,000 maravedís (667 pesos). [132]\r\nThis law was re-promulgated on September 24, 1568, and on September\r\n22, 1626. [133] The provisions of these laws, however, probably\r\napplied only to such cases as might come from provincial justices,\r\nsince appeals from city judges and ayuntamientos could be taken\r\nover by the audiencia with less trouble and expense, because of\r\nthe proximity of the tribunal. As a matter of fact, this opinion\r\nis seemingly substantiated by a new law, dated June 13, 1634, which\r\nordered that an appeal from an ayuntamiento should not be received\r\nin an audiencia unless the suit involved a sum greater than 60,000\r\nmaravedís, or 133 pesos. [134] This was considerably less, it will\r\nbe seen, than the amount fixed as the limit by the law immediately\r\npreceding it, which was promulgated in 1626.\r\n\r\nThe laws establishing the finality of the jurisdiction of the\r\naudiencia were also altered from time to time. The earliest law on\r\nthe subject, dated April 24, 1545, ordered that no appeal should be\r\nmade from the tribunal in cases involving less than 6000 maravedís\r\n(13.3 pesos). [135] This limit was raised to 200 pesos by cédulas of\r\nApril 4, 1558, and March 4, 1559, and by the ordinance of 1563. [136]\r\n\r\nIn 1542, the jurisdiction of the audiencia was made final in all\r\ncases appealed from the ordinary courts. [137] The execution of all\r\ndecisions which were not appealable was rigidly required. [138] By the\r\nordinance of 1563 it was stipulated that sentences of review which\r\nhad been confirmed by the audiencia could not be appealed again,\r\nno matter how large a sum was involved. [139] This was partially\r\nabrogated by the law of February 13, 1620, which ordered that cases\r\ninvolving 6000 pesos of 450 maravedís each, already terminated on\r\nreview by an audiencia, might be further appealed to the king. [140]\r\n\r\nDecisions were reached by the concurrence of a majority of the\r\nmagistrates trying the case. When there were only two oidores present\r\na decision had to be unanimous. In case the full quota of magistrates\r\nwere present and the votes were equally divided, the fiscal might\r\nbe called in to decide the case, but if the latter were prosecuting\r\nthe case, or were otherwise incapacitated, a duly qualified lawyer\r\nmight be chosen to serve as a special magistrate. [141] This rule\r\ndid not apply to the revision of sentences in civil cases wherein\r\nthe value exceeded 300,000 maravedís; in these the concurrence of\r\nthree magistrates was necessary. [142] A record of the judicial\r\ndecisions of the magistrates was kept in the official journal of\r\nthe audiencia. Decisions and legal papers had to be signed by the\r\nmagistrates involved. Oidores who registered dissenting opinions were\r\nobliged to affix their signatures to the autos with those who had voted\r\nin the affirmative, but the negative votes were also recorded. [143]\r\n\r\nWhile the audiencia might repeal the written opinion of an inferior\r\njudge in review of sentence, the revision of verbal decisions of\r\nalcaldes ordinarios could be accomplished only when the alcalde in\r\nquestion had been summoned before the tribunal and the reasons for his\r\ndecision had been investigated in his presence. [144] The audiencia,\r\ntherefore, exercised appellate jurisdiction over civil and criminal\r\ncases tried in first instance by the judges of the provinces.\r\n\r\nIf an alcalde mayor or other inferior judge failed to comply\r\nwith the instructions laid down for his guidance, or if he were\r\nguilty of an abuse in the administration of justice, he was held\r\nto account by the visiting oidor who was dispatched at regular\r\nintervals for the inspection of the provinces--and for the judicial\r\nscrutiny of the provincial courts. In cases of notorious injustice\r\nspecial pesquisidores, usually oidores, were sent at once for the\r\ncorrection of the abuse in question, at the expense of the offending\r\nofficials. [145] These, if found guilty of wilful disobedience,\r\nwere punished in accordance with the gravity of their offenses. The\r\naudiencia had appellate jurisdiction in these cases. [146] The\r\nvisiting oidores imposed fines in accordance with a tariff which\r\nhad been formulated by the audiencia and approved by the Council\r\nof the Indies. [147] All fines levied by the audiencia, either upon\r\nofficials or individuals could be remitted by the president with the\r\nconsent of the acuerdo. [148]\r\n\r\nIt was the policy of the government to give the audiencia final\r\njurisdiction in as many cases as possible. It was desirable to endow\r\nthe colonial tribunals and authorities with sufficient power to make\r\nthem worthy of respect. At the same time it was necessary to relieve\r\nthe Council of the Indies of the duty of hearing the vast number of\r\nindividual suits which would inevitably come to it if that tribunal\r\nwere made too accessible. The Council was occupied with appeals in\r\ngovernment and justice from all of Spain's colonies. It has been\r\nnoted that the limit of value of cases which could be appealed from\r\nthe audiencia to the Council of the Indies was raised in 1620 from\r\n200 to 6000 pesos. This would seem to indicate a growing tendency\r\nto confine suits involving individuals to the colonial tribunals,\r\nthus increasing the importance of the audiencias, and at the same\r\ntime making the Council of the Indies more exclusively a tribunal of\r\nadministration. This change, however, was never completely effected,\r\ndespite the various expedients adopted to discourage the appeal\r\nof individual cases. Persons appealing were obliged to guarantee\r\nthe expenses of suit. The great cost, the delays, and the distance\r\naltogether made appeal difficult. Appeals of longer standing than two\r\nyears were not received from the Philippines in the Council of the\r\nIndies. [149] An investigation of the records shows that most of the\r\ncases appealed to the Council of the Indies involved administrative law\r\nin some form, having to do either with the prosecution of officials,\r\ntheir removal from office, the prosecution of bondsmen, residencias,\r\nconflicts of jurisdiction, or with appeals from the decision of the\r\naudiencia in commercial and ecclesiastical matters.\r\n\r\nThe gradual extension of the jurisdiction of the audiencia over\r\nencomiendas may be cited as an example of the changes in the authority\r\nof the tribunal and in its relation to the Council of the Indies. The\r\nfirst important legislation in regulation of the encomienda was the\r\ncelebrated law of Malines, promulgated in that city by Charles V, on\r\nOctober 20, 1545, and enunciated at successive dates until 1610. The\r\nlaw prescribed the course which was to be pursued by the audiencia\r\nin suits between individuals relative to encomiendas or the Indians\r\nthereon. In these contentions the Council of the Indies and not the\r\naudiencia was the final arbiter. The duty of the latter tribunal was\r\nto collect evidence in these cases, taking the testimony of witnesses\r\nfor both sides and remitting all papers, sealed, to the Council of\r\nthe Indies. The council, on consideration of the evidence, rendered\r\nthe final decision. The audiencia had to conclude its part of the\r\ninvestigation and file its report within a period of three months. This\r\ntime limit was extended to six months in 1554. The purpose of this law\r\nwas to guarantee justice in the assignment and retention of encomiendas\r\nby removing them from the control of the audiencias, whose magistrates,\r\nas experience had proved, often allowed themselves to be influenced\r\nby local prejudices. Encomiendas were to be assigned by the king,\r\nin theory at least, and no other authority save the monarch and his\r\ncouncil could exercise jurisdiction over them. [150]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was, however, authorized to act as the protector of\r\npersons holding Indians on encomiendas, to see that they were not\r\nunjustly deprived of or wrongfully disturbed in their holdings. In\r\ncase a person were thus deprived of his Indians, the audiencia was\r\nempowered to restore conditions to their former state. If the aggressor\r\npersisted, or cared to contest the right of his opponent to the Indians\r\nin question, the audiencia was ordered to observe the law of Malines,\r\ncollecting all the evidence in the case, and forwarding it to the\r\nCouncil of the Indies for final decision. The frequency of litigation,\r\nhowever, and the vast number of unimportant cases which arose under\r\nthe provisions of the law of Malines came to demand too much of the\r\ntime and attention of the Council of the Indies, thereby causing\r\nmany delays in suits involving encomiendas. In order to remedy this\r\ndefect, Philip III, on April 17, 1609, conferred on the audiencia\r\njurisdiction over all cases involving encomiendas, repartimientos,\r\n[151] tributes, and despoliations of Indians up to the value of a\r\nthousand ducats. [152] Cases involving a greater value were still to\r\nbe settled in conformity with the law of Malines. Finally, in 1624\r\nit was ordered that in suits which did not involve more than three\r\nIndians and in cases wherein the costs of litigation exceeded the\r\namount in dispute, the decree of the governor should prevail. For\r\nobvious reasons, the audiencia could not concern itself with such\r\ncases, but when the value of the Indians justified the attention\r\nof the tribunal, its decisions were final, taking precedence over\r\nthose of the governor. [153] This, then, was the final status of the\r\njurisdiction of the audiencia over encomiendas as set forth in the laws\r\nof the Indies. In the Philippines the authority of the tribunal in\r\nregard to them was neither executive nor legislative, except in such\r\ncases and on such occasions as we shall refer to later. The judicial\r\nauthority of the Audiencia of Manila over encomiendas was indisputable.\r\n\r\nHaving indicated the general basis upon which the authority of the\r\naudiencia rested, we may more precisely define its jurisdiction by\r\nreviewing a few of the most characteristic cases which were tried\r\nin the tribunal in accordance with the laws already discussed. The\r\nstatement has been made that at the time of its establishment the\r\naudiencia was needed as a court of justice and that it was removed\r\nin 1589 for political reasons rather than because of the inadequacy\r\nor failure of the institution as a tribunal of justice. In the\r\npreceding chapter we saw that the audiencia was designed to relieve\r\nthe executive of judicial duties, such as the trial of cases appealed\r\nfrom the alcaldes mayores of the provinces and the alcaldes ordinarios\r\nof the city. These functions, up to the time of the establishment of\r\nthe audiencia, had been exercised by the governor. This had resulted\r\nin favoritism and in a perversion of justice to the private ends\r\nof the governor and of his friends. Perhaps the chief evil under\r\nthe system had proceeded from the governor's double jurisdiction,\r\nas both executive and judge, over cases involving encomiendas and\r\nencomenderos. The governor assigned encomiendas in the name of the\r\nking, and he was also judge with final jurisdiction over all suits\r\ninvolving them, the law of Malines being impossible of execution in\r\nthe Philippines before the establishment of the audiencia, and after\r\nits withdrawal in 1589. [154]\r\n\r\nThe same was true in regard to commercial cases, and complaints\r\nwere ever arising against the governor's high-handed proceedings\r\nin the allotment of cargo space on the galleons to his friends,\r\nand his monopolization of the best Chinese goods that came to\r\nManila. The governor, as in the assignment of encomiendas, enjoyed\r\nan undue advantage in these matters, for at the same time that he\r\nwas the executive with the power of bestowing these favors, he was\r\nthe sole judge in all contentions which arose regarding commerce. It\r\nwas therefore distinctly in the interests of justice that a supreme\r\ncourt should be established, and it is easy to understand why those\r\nwho had profited by the absence of the audiencia should oppose its\r\nrestoration, and why others should take the opposite view.\r\n\r\nSoon after the audiencia was abolished in 1589, arguments were\r\npresented at court for its restoration. From the large number of\r\npetitions that were presented, two, aside from those discussed in\r\nthe preceding chapter, may be cited here because they illustrate\r\nthe disadvantages from a judicial point of view of having the\r\nadministration of justice in the hands of the governor, with appeal\r\nto Mexico. Francisco de la Misa, factor of the treasury of Manila,\r\nwrote a memorial to the king on May 31, 1595, [155] referring to the\r\ndelay which had arisen in the trial of suits involving encomiendas: the\r\njurisdiction of the governor was not final; appeals had to be carried\r\nto the Audiencia of Mexico and cases involving a thousand ducats or\r\nmore had to be taken from that tribunal to the Council of the Indies;\r\n[156] this meant two appeals and much delay. He mentioned certain\r\ncases which had been pending two years, and showed that, because of\r\nthe delay to which they had been subjected in Mexico, it would be at\r\nleast two years more before the decisions could be returned. Misa said\r\nthat conditions had reverted to the state which had existed before the\r\naudiencia was established; a much larger number of cases was awaiting\r\ntrial than the governor and his lieutenant could attempt to try. These\r\ndifficulties were multiplied by the fact that there was no fiscal,\r\nan officer whose services as legal adviser to the government and as\r\nprosecuting attorney were indispensable. [157]\r\n\r\nMisa petitioned for a reform of the law which had established the\r\ngovernor as judge of ultimate recourse in cases involving one thousand\r\npesos (ducats) or less. He believed it advisable to reduce the limit\r\nof the value of cases settled in the colony from one thousand to four\r\nhundred pesos and appeal all those exceeding the latter sum to the\r\nAudiencia of Mexico. It would result in a more equitable administration\r\nof justice, he stated, if the trial of important cases were conducted\r\nin second instance before that tribunal. This practice, though subject\r\nto great delay, would have the advantage of guaranteeing the review\r\nof these cases by a competent and properly qualified magistracy\r\nrather than by a biased and tyrannical executive. He alleged that\r\nfour hundred pesos in the Philippines meant as much as a thousand\r\nelsewhere. Another suggestion advanced by Misa was that suits and\r\ninvestigations involving real hacienda should be tried by competent\r\njudges, rather than by the governor, whose own personal interest in the\r\ncases was often too great to ensure fair trial. Another evil pointed\r\nout by Misa, and a fairly typical one throughout the history of the\r\ncolony, was the delay and uncertainty of the residencia. This defect\r\nwas particularly apparent at this time because all cases of residencia\r\nhad to be sent to Mexico, since there was no tribunal in Manila\r\nwith jurisdiction on appeal over these official investigations. Misa\r\ndescribed the plight of various alcaldes mayores, corregidores, and\r\nother officials who had been investigated and suspended from office,\r\nawaiting the outcome of the residencia. There were no persons to take\r\ntheir places; as a result, the suspended officials were without gainful\r\nemployment, while their districts and offices reverted to a state\r\nof lawlessness, barbarism and disorder, without governor, judges,\r\nor incumbents. The governor had attempted to remedy the trouble\r\nby making temporary appointments from among the removed officials,\r\nbut this he had no authority to do; moreover, the reinstatement of\r\nofficials whose conduct was under investigation was subversive of\r\nthe best interests of government and justice. The governor's action\r\nin these cases had raised a storm of protest in the colony, yet he\r\nwas forced to take these steps in preference to leaving the natives\r\nwithout government and protection. Misa presented this picture of\r\nthe state of affairs in the colony to show the evil results of the\r\nabsence from the Philippines of a tribunal with authority to conduct\r\nresidencias and to provide offices.\r\n\r\nWhile this series of complaints was not followed by an open advocacy\r\nof the establishment of a royal audiencia in Manila, the defects\r\nwhich were pointed out showed the desirability of putting an end\r\nto the governor's intervention in judicial matters. There can be no\r\nquestion but that the arrival at court of such letters showed clearly\r\nthe need of a tribunal at Manila for the administration of justice.\r\n\r\nComplaints were also directed against this state of affairs by Antonio\r\nde Morga, lieutenant-governor of the Islands. This official argued\r\nthat the commonwealth required an audiencia in order to secure a more\r\nequitable administration of justice. [158] He called attention to the\r\novercrowded docket of the court over which he presided and emphasized\r\nthe impossibility of the satisfactory termination of the cases waiting\r\nto be tried. That the defects referred to in these communications\r\nwere appreciated at court is evidenced by the cédula of May 26,\r\n1595, which emphasized the necessity of administering justice in the\r\nPhilippines with \"universal equality, mildness and satisfaction.\" [159]\r\n\r\nNevertheless the presence of a tribunal had the effect of encouraging\r\nthe inhabitants of the Islands to litigation. It has been said that\r\nthere have been more lawsuits in the Philippines than in any other\r\ncountry of the same size and population, which remark probably would\r\napply to any country where the Spanish judicial system had lately\r\nobtained. This condition was no doubt due to the fact that adequate\r\nfacilities existed whereby the natives could go to law. Lawyers\r\nand judges were ever unduly ready to encourage and hear any suits\r\nwhich might arise if there were any way in which profit might be\r\nderived therefrom. Pardo de Tavera, in discussing these phases of\r\nthe legal history of the Islands, states that the laws protected the\r\nnative, but at the same time they kept him in a state of perpetual\r\ntutelage. Judgments were passed by native magistrates in suits\r\nbetween natives in the later days of Spanish rule, but in general\r\nthroughout the period of Spain's domination suits were prosecuted\r\nunder the direction of a protector of the Indians in case one party\r\nto a suit was a Spaniard, or when the rights of the natives were in\r\nany way jeopardized or injured by a Spaniard. \"In this manner Spanish\r\nprestige was preserved, inasmuch as it was no longer an Indian who\r\nasked for the punishment of one belonging to a superior race, but a\r\nSpaniard who took up the Indian's cause and conducted the suit against\r\nanother Spaniard.\" [160] Thus it may be seen that in Spain's judicial\r\nsystem the means were provided, in theory at least, whereby the meanest\r\nnative could obtain justice, not only among his fellows, but in cases\r\nto which members of the superior Spanish race were parties.\r\n\r\nThe declared purpose of the whole system of legislation for the Indies\r\nwas the material and spiritual well-being of the Indians. [161] The\r\nofficials of the government, the churchmen, and the encomenderos\r\nwere especially charged in their commissions and in official\r\ncorrespondence to make the protection and welfare of the Indians\r\ntheir chief concern. Attention has just been directed to the office\r\nof protector of the Indians. The fiscal, or one of his assistants,\r\nattended to that duty in the Audiencia of Manila, while agents\r\n(agentes fiscales) were especially commissioned by the fiscal to act\r\nin that capacity in the provinces. [162] We have also noted that the\r\noidores were charged with the duty of protecting the Indians when\r\nofficiating as visitors in the provinces. Such cases, also those\r\ninvolving decisions of corregidores and alcaldes mayores by which\r\nthe natives were dealt with unjustly, were appealable, under certain\r\ncircumstances, to the audiencia. These cases commanded the immediate\r\nattention of the tribunal, to the exclusion of other business. [163]\r\nAmong the vast number of cases at our disposal which illustrate the\r\njurisdiction of the tribunal over such matters, the following may be\r\nselected as typical. On May 16, 1796, the fiscal brought a charge in\r\nthe audiencia against the governor, exposing the sufferings inflicted\r\nupon the Indians of the barrio of Santa Ana by the corregidor of Tondo\r\n[164] in connection with the construction of a road. The audiencia\r\nrefused to consider the case in first instance, as the matter was not\r\ncontentious, but it recommended that the fiscal should make the charges\r\nbefore the governor and have him render a decision upon the matter; if\r\nexception were taken to his decision the case could be appealed to the\r\naudiencia. The oidores found that they were without jurisdiction over\r\nthe case in first instance and they declared that their entertainment\r\nof the suit would be in violation of the laws of the Indies. [165]\r\nThe fiscal appealed from the judgment of the audiencia. The Council\r\nof the Indies, in a return communication dated May 13, 1798, [166]\r\napproved the ruling of the audiencia, affirming that in cases of\r\nthe nature referred to, the fiscal, as protector of the Indians,\r\nshould submit testimony in behalf of the latter to the governor,\r\nwho should consider whether the Indians had been wronged and render\r\nhis decision accordingly. If exception were taken to the decision of\r\nthe governor, the case could then be appealed to the audiencia. While\r\nthese appeals and this litigation were in progress, the Indians were\r\nbeing subjected to repeated hardships.\r\n\r\nThis case is illustrative of the ineffectiveness of the system for the\r\nadministration of justice in Spain's colonies. It had taken two years\r\nfor this appeal to be carried to Spain and receive the attention of\r\nthe Council of the Indies. The answer had yet to be returned, probably\r\nrequiring at least a year more for the return of the Vera Cruz and\r\nAcapulco galleons and for the proper proceedings to be carried on\r\nin the Manila tribunal. It is questionable whether the Indians in\r\nwhose interests this was ultimately done ever received any benefit\r\nfrom these legal proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe case which has just been described involved the trial and\r\npunishment of a corregidor in the defense and protection of the\r\nnatives. It is important to note that this case was ordered to be\r\ntried in first instance by the governor and not by the audiencia. The\r\njurisdiction of the latter tribunal in second instance was confirmed\r\nby the king on this occasion. By the law of October 9, 1812, and by\r\nothers made pursuant to the Constitution of 1812, the audiencia was\r\ngiven jurisdiction in first instance over cases involving provincial\r\nofficials, and particularly judges. In regard to the care and\r\nprotection of the Indians, which was involved in this controversy,\r\nthe law provided that such cases should be treated originally by the\r\ncorregidores and alcaldes mayores with appeal to the audiencia. [167]\r\nBut this case dealt primarily with the official conduct of a\r\ncorregidor, over whom the governor had more direct jurisdiction. The\r\ncédula of May 13, 1798, which constituted the reply of the king to\r\nthe appeal of the fiscal in the case described above, ordered that\r\nhenceforth in cases affecting the relations of the corregidores and\r\nalcaldes mayores on the one part and the Indians on the other, the\r\nfiscal, audiencia, and governor should act in acuerdo, in that way\r\navoiding friction and quarrels over jurisdiction. [168]\r\n\r\nThat the audiencia did not always try cases relating to the Indians\r\nwith requisite promptness, is evidenced by the many and repeated\r\nletters of the king to the tribunal, to the fiscal, as protector of the\r\nIndians, and to the regent, chiding these officials for delay. On many\r\noccasions the royal zeal for justice in the treatment of the Indians,\r\nbased on a lack of knowledge of the true nature of the Filipino,\r\ncompletely overruled all considerations of practicability and common\r\nsense. As an illustration of this, on June 20, 1686, certain natives\r\nof the province of Bulacán sent false evidence to the Council of the\r\nIndies; this testimony was taken in preference to that remitted by\r\nthe audiencia, the decision of the latter body being reversed by the\r\nCouncil of the Indies. The audiencia refused to allow the execution of\r\nthe new judgment; the oidores all offered to resign in protest, and\r\nthe regent, at the risk of removal, reopened the case. It was proved\r\nby the testimony of a number of officials and by the confessions of\r\nthe natives who had perjured themselves that the evidence upon which\r\nthe Council had acted was false. [169] A record of these proceedings\r\nwas remitted to the Council and that tribunal promptly reversed its\r\nformer decision.\r\n\r\nFurther illustrations of the authority of the audiencia in cases\r\ninvolving natives may be seen in suits which arose from time to\r\ntime over the illegal treatment of the latter by the friars and the\r\nunjust occupation of the natives' lands by the religious orders. These\r\nsuits afford illustration, also, of the services of the audiencia as\r\nan agency to force persons to show their titles to lands which they\r\nheld. [170] This jurisdiction will be given more detailed treatment\r\nin the proper place, but the brief citation of one or two cases among\r\nmany seems advisable to illustrate the activity of the audiencia in\r\nprotecting the Indians, both by trying suits involving them and by\r\nactually intervening in their behalf.\r\n\r\nVarious revolts broke out among the Indians near Manila from 1740\r\nto 1750. These insurrections were said to have been provoked by the\r\nencroachments of the Augustinians and Dominicans on the lands of the\r\nnatives. The matter was called to the attention of the home government,\r\nand Pedro Calderón Enríquez, an oidor, was ordered to investigate\r\nthe charges made against these religious orders and to ascertain\r\nthe validity of their claims to the lands in question. The friars,\r\nwhen ordered to submit titles to a secular judge, refused to comply,\r\nclaiming ecclesiastical exemption. In the face of their opposition,\r\nCalderón dispossessed the friars of the lands which they were said to\r\nhave usurped and which they were continuing to hold without legitimate\r\ntitle, restoring the lands to the crown. The case was appealed to\r\nthe audiencia and that tribunal upheld the visitor.\r\n\r\nCalderón also found that the University of Santo Tomás and the\r\nDominicans, in collusion with a clerk of the audiencia, had taken\r\nlands from the native town of Sílang in 1743. Calderón restored the\r\nlands to their rightful owners and his act was approved in judicial\r\nreview by the audiencia. The friars took exception to this by appealing\r\nto the Council of the Indies. The Council notified the audiencia of\r\nits affirmation of the judgment of Calderón and further stated that\r\nthe lands of Sílang, Imús, San Nicolás, and Cavite had been unjustly\r\nseized and should be restored. This was not only an affirmation but\r\nan extension of the sentence of the oidor, made by the Council after\r\nthe royal fiscal (of the Council of the Indies) had reviewed all the\r\nevidence presented in the case. This suit shows the efforts made to\r\ncarry out the royal intention that the natives of Spain's colonies\r\nshould be justly treated. It also shows the respective jurisdictions\r\nof the audiencia and Council of the Indies as courts of review and\r\nappeal in adjusting disputes between the church and the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the audiencia exercised jurisdiction over the\r\nreligious themselves, both as individuals and as subjects of the king,\r\npunishing them for violation of the civil laws of the realm to which\r\nthey were amenable as subjects. An illustration of this is furnished by\r\nthe following case which occurred in 1617. Two Augustinian provincials\r\nwere murdered, one, Fray Gerónimo de Salas, by poisoning, and his\r\nsuccessor, Fray Vicente Sepúlveda, by strangulation. A tribunal of\r\nfriars, composed of nine prominent members of the Augustinian order,\r\nwas appointed by the bishop for the investigation of the crime. This\r\nbody, after due consideration, caused six members of the order to be\r\napprehended; four of them were believed to be guilty of the murder\r\nand two were suspected of connivance at the crime. On July 31, 1617,\r\nthese six culprits were handed over to the civil government, and on\r\nSeptember 2 of that year, the four guilty ecclesiastics were condemned\r\nto death by the audiencia, while the other two were sentenced to six\r\nyears of service in the galleys. This case illustrates the extent\r\nof ecclesiastical jurisdiction exercised respectively by the church\r\nand government tribunals under the fuero mixto. [171] The former,\r\non this occasion, made the preliminary investigations and handed the\r\nculprits over to the secular authority with recommendations; the latter\r\nconducted the trial, passed sentence and saw to its execution. The\r\ntrial and conclusion of this case covered the remarkably short period\r\nof thirty-three days. [172]\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the authority of the audiencia over ecclesiastical\r\naffairs extended to disputes between orders, between the government\r\nand the church, or its representatives, to cases relating to land\r\ntitles, to those alleging abuses of the Indians by the friars, to\r\ncases involving the royal patronage, and to cases of fuerza. [173]\r\nAs the question of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the audiencia\r\nwill be discussed more fully in subsequent chapters, no effort will\r\nbe made at this time to particularize concerning its authority over\r\nchurch affairs, it being merely desirable to suggest the fact here\r\nthat the audiencia had jurisdiction in suits involving the church and\r\nthe civil government and in those which had to do with the protection\r\nof the natives from the abuses of the ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\nRecords of thousands of cases exist to show the different kinds of\r\nsuits tried judicially in the audiencia. Civil and criminal matters\r\ncame up in the tribunal as in all other courts of law, and hence,\r\nas such, merit only passing attention. Among civil cases possibly the\r\nmost typical were those relating to encomiendas. It must be borne in\r\nmind that the Spaniard, however mistakenly from the theoretical point\r\nof view, regarded the encomiendas as property in the same sense as\r\na modern farmer regards his farm as property. He paid a rental or\r\ntax to the government, he engaged in agriculture for gain, and, as\r\nwe have seen, the moral duty of protecting, uplifting, or educating\r\nthe Indians rested but lightly on his conscience. Therefore, as these\r\ncases are discussed in the following pages, the value of the property\r\nand not the treatment of the Indians on the encomiendas is the first\r\nconsideration. As already stated, the law of Malines reserved for the\r\nCouncil of the Indies final action in all encomienda suits involving\r\nmore than one thousand ducats. [174]\r\n\r\nMany suits involving encomiendas came up prior to the establishment\r\nof the audiencia; the defects apparent in the trial of these cases by\r\nthe governor show clearly the need of an audiencia at that time. The\r\nearliest case noted in this connection was prosecuted in 1580 by the\r\nasesor of the governor against Doña Lucía de Loaxa, the widow of an\r\nencomendero, with the object of dispossessing her of an encomienda\r\nheld at Butuán, Mindanao. [175] She was charged with having nullified\r\nher title by marriage to another encomendero, since the law forbade\r\nmarried women to hold encomiendas. In her defense she alleged that\r\nthe desire of the governor to enforce the law was only pretense,\r\nsince many married women in the Philippines held encomiendas. She\r\nstated that the governor desired to deprive her of her property in\r\norder that he might bestow it upon a friend. This case was carried\r\nto the Council of the Indies, and it illustrates the effectiveness\r\nof the law of Malines, which took from the governor authority over\r\na case in which he was interested and gave final jurisdiction to the\r\ntribunal in Spain. The papers pertaining to this case were returned\r\nto the governor with orders to do as the law commanded. The defendant\r\nwas accordingly removed from the encomienda.\r\n\r\nAnother case was disposed of in a slightly different manner. On January\r\n22, 1581, Juan Gutiérrez de Figueroa, second husband of Magdalena\r\nRodríguez, widow of an encomendero of Mindanao, filed suit before the\r\ngovernor praying to be continued as possessor of an encomienda which\r\nhis wife had held prior to her marriage to him. He brought the suit\r\non the grounds that he was a soldier and was accordingly deserving\r\nof reward. This case, in accordance with the provisions of Malines,\r\ncame within the jurisdiction of the governor. He denied the petition,\r\nbut the soldier appealed the case to the Council of the Indies and that\r\ntribunal again reversed the decision of the governor on May 23, 1584.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1582, Bishop Salazar, as protector of the Indians,\r\nbrought suit before Governor Ronquillo de Peñalosa against Juan de\r\nAyala, a Spaniard holding various encomiendas in different parts of\r\nthe Island of Luzón, but resident in Manila. Two specific charges\r\nwere brought against Ayala. He was said to have reduced the Indians\r\non his encomiendas to the status of slaves, which was forbidden\r\nby the law of November 9, 1526. [176] He had also violated the law\r\nwhich prescribed that encomenderos should live on their encomiendas,\r\n[177] and give their personal attention to the Indians thereon. Ayala\r\nadduced testimony to prove that this law was a dead-letter and that\r\nit was disregarded by most of the encomenderos. He even showed that\r\nthere were many of them residing in Spain who held encomiendas in\r\nSpain and Perú. Governor Ronquillo felt that the evidence at hand was\r\ninsufficient to justify a decision in this case, so he permitted it to\r\nbe carried to the Council of the Indies. The latter tribunal rendered\r\nits decision on June 24, 1584, communicating to the Audiencia of Manila\r\nits ruling that Ayala should be allowed to retain the encomiendas in\r\nquestion, but the president and oidores were especially charged to\r\nenforce the law prohibiting slavery in the Indies.\r\n\r\nThe procedure in these cases confirms the laws already alluded to,\r\nwhich were promulgated before the establishment of the audiencia,\r\nthat the governor should have jurisdiction in suits involving less\r\nthan a thousand ducats, with appeal to the Council of the Indies. It\r\nwould also appear, from the data at our command, that the audiencia\r\ninherited the governor's former authority in these matters.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from 1583 to 1589, and after the re-establishment of\r\nthe audiencia in Manila, this tribunal exercised authority over suits\r\ninvolving encomiendas. There is so much sameness in the nature of these\r\ncases that little would be added by describing them. There appears\r\nevidence of considerable conflict of jurisdiction, however, between\r\nthe governor and the audiencia over the adjustment of the latter\r\nto the new situation relative to the encomiendas. Governors Acuña,\r\nTello and Fajardo sought on various occasions to retain jurisdiction\r\nover suits involving encomiendas on the basis of the law of Malines,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the audiencia had been given the duty of\r\ntrying such cases. When appeals were made to the Council of the Indies,\r\nthat tribunal made clear its determination that the audiencia should\r\ntry suits involving encomiendas, but that in administrative matters\r\nrelating thereto the will of the governor should prevail, unless\r\nhis decision were contested through legal channels. An illustration\r\nof such difference of opinion may be noted in the letter written by\r\nGovernor Juan Niño de Tavora on August 4, 1628, to the Council of the\r\nIndies. Tavora complained of the action of the audiencia in regard\r\nto the disposal of a case involving an encomendero who had married\r\nthe widow of another encomendero, and who had tried to unite and\r\nhold both their encomiendas after marriage. The governor contended\r\nthat two persons holding encomiendas by previous right should choose\r\nthe more desirable one and relinquish the other, in accordance with\r\nthe practice in other places. Especially should this be done in the\r\nPhilippines, he held, because there were so few encomiendas in the\r\nIslands. The fiscal approved of this suggestion and made a motion\r\nbefore the acuerdo of the audiencia that this course should be pursued,\r\nbut, as no laws had been promulgated on the subject, there was no\r\nprecedent to follow. The audiencia accordingly declared that such\r\na course as the governor had suggested would not be legal. Tavora\r\npetitioned the Council of the Indies for a ruling on the subject. The\r\nCouncil sustained the governor in its consulta of January 15, 1630.\r\n\r\nThere was apparently no limit to the value of suits involving\r\nencomiendas which might be tried in the audiencia, and appealed to\r\nthe Council of the Indies. There exists the record of one case in\r\nwhich the encomienda was valued at 223,000 pesos. In this suit the\r\nfiscal proceeded against Doña Juana Leal and Francisco de Rebolledo,\r\nresidents of Mexico, for possession of an encomienda held in the\r\nPhilippines. This case affords an illustration of the delays to\r\nwhich the course of justice was subject, it being appealed to the\r\nCouncil of the Indies in 1612, and not finally settled till 1620. A\r\nsuit involving an encomienda valued at 430,102 pesos came before\r\nthe audiencia in 1703, when two residents of Manila, named Delgado\r\nand Abaurrea, were dispossessed of an encomienda by the governor. The\r\nencomienda was awarded immediately to Juan de Echevarría and Antonio de\r\nEndaya. The latter were prosecuted in the audiencia by the dispossessed\r\nencomenderos, and the tribunal, in compliance with the law of Malines,\r\nmade the prescribed investigation, recommending that the governor's\r\naction should be disapproved, since the evidence showed that the\r\npersons installed on the encomienda were distant relatives of the\r\ngovernor. The Council adopted the recommendations of the audiencia in\r\nthis case, ordering that the original encomenderos should be restored\r\nto their estate, and that this breach of royal commands should be\r\nregistered against the governor to be answered in his residencia.\r\n\r\nAnother suit, of a similar nature to that described above, was\r\nbrought in the audiencia in 1713 against Juan de Rivas, who had\r\nbeen assigned two encomiendas in Leyte and Cebú, respectively,\r\nby the governor, thus depriving one Saramiento who had held them\r\nformerly. The plaintiff claimed that he had made great improvements\r\non these estates, spending all his income thereon, and as yet had\r\nreceived no profits from the lands. He petitioned, therefore, that\r\nthese encomiendas should be bestowed upon him for another term. [178]\r\nThe audiencia withheld its judgment on this case, referring it to the\r\nCouncil. That body, after seeking the advice of the royal fiscal and\r\ncontador, recommended to the king that Saramiento should be allowed to\r\nretain the encomiendas for another term, and it was accordingly done,\r\na royal order to that effect being expedited on May 29, 1715.\r\n\r\nIt is notable how frequently the action of the audiencia or that of\r\nthe governor was confirmed by the Council of the Indies. In most of\r\nthe cases which have been described, the original papers, including\r\nletters, autos and testimonios, each expediente [179] containing from\r\none hundred to two thousand pages, are marked \"seen by the Council\",\r\n\"action of the governor confirmed\", or \"no action to be taken\";\r\nthe original decisions being thus confirmed. It may be concluded,\r\ntherefore, from this brief study that the audiencia had appellate\r\njurisdiction as a court of law over suits involving encomiendas, and,\r\nfurthermore, that the tribunal acting in that capacity placed a very\r\neffective and definite check on the governor in his executive control\r\nover encomiendas.\r\n\r\nProperty suits, aside from those involving encomiendas, were\r\nnumerous. One noted case may be cited in which the heirs of Governor\r\nFausto Cruzat y Góngora in 1703 brought suit to recover money owed\r\nby Gaspar Sánchez and Bernardo de Guirós to the ex-governor. The\r\naudiencia failed to award the sum, which approximated 8000 pesos. The\r\ncase was appealed to the Council of the Indies and the decision was\r\nreversed, the plaintiffs being awarded the money originally sued for,\r\nwith costs of suit. A similar case was brought by the children and\r\nheirs of Governor Bustamante against Juan de Nebra, general of the\r\ngalleon. The case was tried in the audiencia and the tribunal decided\r\nin favor of the defendant. The case was appealed to the Council of\r\nthe Indies and the decision was reversed. [180] In 1736 Gaspar Thomé,\r\na Frenchman, sued the estate of a deceased debtor, Juan de Olerte,\r\nfor 2000 pesos. [181] The case was appealed to the Council of the\r\nIndies, and fully two hundred pages of documentary material exist,\r\ncarefully annotated and digested, to show how thoroughly and with\r\nwhat formality a suit of even that small import was tried. We have\r\nalready noted the tendency of the government to discourage the appeal\r\nof property suits to the Council of the Indies. The jurisdiction of\r\nthe audiencia was final, for the most part, in suits involving sums\r\nfrom 200 to 6000 pesos.\r\n\r\nAs matters of trade were always important in the life and politics of\r\nthe Islands, commercial suits commanded a large share of the attention\r\nof the audiencia. Up to 1769 the jurisdiction of the audiencia was\r\nsupreme in matters relating thereto, [182] but on December 13 of that\r\nyear a consulado was established at Manila, thereby relieving the\r\naudiencia of much of its former control over commercial affairs. [183]\r\nThe consulado, from the time of its establishment, was an ever-present\r\nthorn in the side of the audiencia and conflicts over the respective\r\njurisdictions of the tribunals [184] were continually arising. We\r\nmay briefly cite one or two cases to illustrate the respective\r\njurisdictions of the audiencia and the tribunal of the consulado. On\r\nDecember 26, 1806, action was brought by two Spaniards against the\r\nBritish firm of Jacob Smith and Company on account of the inferior\r\nquality of goods sold to the plaintiff by that firm. [185] Suit\r\nwas brought originally in the audiencia, but the consulado applied\r\nto the governor for jurisdiction in the case on the ground that,\r\nas a commercial suit, it should be tried in the consulado. [186]\r\nThe governor awarded jurisdiction to the audiencia. The consulado\r\nre-appealed the case, but the Council sustained the governor's decision\r\non the ground that this was a suit between a private individual and\r\na merchant which should be tried in the audiencia, the tribunal which\r\nusually tried cases between individuals. The function of the consulado,\r\nthe royal decree stated, was to try suits of a commercial character\r\nwhich arose between merchants. [187]\r\n\r\nAn occasion on which the jurisdiction of the audiencia was unquestioned\r\nmay be noted in the suit which was appealed to the Council of the\r\nIndies from the audiencia in 1698, over the wrecking of the galleon\r\n\"San Francisco Xavier\". The admiral, Don Esteban Ramos, was held\r\naccountable for the silver carried on the ship and the merchants of\r\nManila sued him for what they had lost in the wreck. [188] It was\r\ncharged that Ramos had landed the silver, but was seeking to conceal\r\nthat fact, claiming instead that it was lost. The case was appealed\r\nto the Council by the defendant. [189] The Council referred the case\r\nto the Junta de Guerra, [190] and that tribunal reversed the decision\r\nof the audiencia, declaring that Ramos was a faithful servant of His\r\nMajesty, and still a poor man. There was no possibility of his having\r\nthe silver. Ramos was transferred to the Atlantic flota. [191] The\r\nroyal fiscal, in the opinion rendered for the guidance of the junta,\r\nmade the comment that frequently the oidores of colonial audiencias\r\nwere influenced, against their own ideas of justice, by the opinions\r\nand wishes of the most powerful residents. Such was possibly the case\r\nin Manila on this occasion. This statement at least shows that those\r\nin control at Madrid were aware of some of the fundamental weaknesses\r\nof the colonial audiencias.\r\n\r\nAnother typical case, indirectly connected with commerce, occurred\r\nin 1713, when the fiscal of the audiencia prosecuted three captains,\r\nEnrique Boynont, Fernando Gall and Diego Brunet, who had arrived at\r\nCavite in command of French merchant and exploring ships, without the\r\nroyal permission to trade in the Islands. These captains, who were\r\nforeigners, of course, were charged with smuggling, and were brought\r\nbefore the royal audiencia. The charges against them were not proved,\r\nand in due time the cases were dismissed. [192] The laws of the Indies\r\nauthorized the governor and the alcaldes del crimen to try cases of\r\nstrangers, [193] but in Manila, where there were no magistrates of\r\nthis category, such cases were tried by the audiencia.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important commercial suit that was ever tried in the\r\nAudiencia of Manila, came before that tribunal in 1656, when several\r\nresidents of Mexico were excluded from the use of the galleon and\r\ntheir goods confiscated. This action was in accordance with repeated\r\ncédulas and regulations which reserved the space in the galleon for\r\nthe exclusive use of the Manila merchants and authorities. Mexican\r\ntraders, who had from time to time shipped goods on the galleons,\r\nwere forbidden to crowd out the Manila merchants, who depended on\r\nthat trade exclusively. The fine levied on this occasion amounted to\r\n273,133 pesos. The case was appealed to the Council of the Indies,\r\nthe aforesaid decision was upheld, and the sum was finally ordered\r\npaid in Mexico. [194]\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the audiencia's existence there was no\r\nconsulado in Manila and the jurisdiction of the audiencia in commercial\r\ncases extended to suits between merchants for space on the galleon. The\r\ntribunal had jurisdiction over the trial of officials for dishonesty in\r\nthe assignment of galleon space: investigations of officials charged\r\nwith reserving more than their due share of space, and such other\r\ncases as are mentioned in the laws of the Indies as being the concern\r\nof the consulados of Lima and Mexico. [195] Officers of the galleons\r\nwere tried for mistreating seamen, for smuggling, for exceeding the\r\nlimit of merchandise allowed, for giving passage to lewd women and\r\nto persons travelling on the galleons without permission. They were\r\ntried for carrying more slaves than they were allowed by law to carry,\r\nfor charging exorbitant prices of passage, and for failing to turn\r\nin accounts of money collected. Commanders were often held criminally\r\nresponsible for carelessness in navigation and for shipwrecks. These\r\ncases were tried in the tribunal of the consulado after 1769.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia had appellate jurisdiction over all residents of the\r\ncolony, both natives and Spaniards. All crimes committed within five\r\nleagues of the city of Manila were ordered to be tried by the oidores\r\nin first instance, [196] but unless they were of extraordinary\r\nimportance, special investigators, usually alcaldes mayores or\r\nalcaldes ordinarios, were delegated to try them in the name of the\r\naudiencia. [197] As already stated, most of the criminal cases arising\r\nin the colony were tried in first instance in the provinces by the\r\nalcaldes mayores. Cases appealed to the audiencia were reviewed in\r\nthat tribunal. The trial consisted of an examination of the summary\r\nor abstract of the case as it was originally tried by the lower judge\r\nand, if errors were found to exist, the decision was either reversed\r\nor the case was remanded to the judge who first had tried the case,\r\nfor second trial. [198] The audiencia did not try the case with the\r\ndefendant present. It merely reviewed the proceedings of the lower\r\njudge. Criminal cases were not ordinarily appealable to the Council\r\nof the Indies.\r\n\r\nThe procedure in criminal cases was generally so similar to that\r\nalready described that it is unnecessary to give any illustration\r\nof the audiencia's criminal jurisdiction. Most of the cases that\r\neventually reached the audiencia involved Spaniards, native caciques,\r\nand half-castes. Natives who were charged with robbery, murder, and\r\ncrimes of a depraved nature were usually of a class unable to finance\r\nappeals to the audiencia. This fact probably accounts for the scarcity\r\nof criminal cases appealed during the first two centuries of the\r\naudiencia's existence. [199] However, the reforms of the nineteenth\r\ncentury brought an increased number of cases into the audiencia by\r\nsystematizing the administration of justice, differentiating the\r\njudgeships from administrative offices, and providing for greater\r\nfacility of appeal. [200]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that in criminal as well as in civil cases, Spaniards\r\nderived considerable benefit from the fact that the audiencia was\r\ncomposed of magistrates of their own nationality. High officials, no\r\ndoubt, escaped the consequences of their misdeeds more easily than did\r\nmen of more modest social and political attainments. This is shown by\r\nthe well-known case of the murder by Governor Fajardo of his wife on\r\nJuly 21, 1621; this came up before an audiencia which was composed of\r\njudges who were largely under the governor's domination. The tribunal\r\ngave the matter a cursory investigation, after which the governor was\r\nallowed to go unpunished. [201] We shall see that proceedings were\r\ndifferent, however, when officials under investigation were charged\r\nwith offenses against the government. The residencia, which dealt\r\nwith such charges, was a pitiless form of inquisition in which the\r\nofficiating magistrate was in duty bound to find his victim guilty,\r\nif possible.\r\n\r\nCriminal cases of a character slightly different from those described\r\nabove were prosecuted by the government for the infraction of any\r\ngovernmental regulation, or for the evasion of the payment of taxes\r\nor duties. The collection of revenues devolved upon the oficiales\r\nreales and they were ordered to accomplish their duties in this\r\nparticular, if possible, without the assistance of the courts. [202]\r\nNumerous cases did come up in the audiencia, however, involving the\r\nprosecution of individuals for violations of the alcabala, quinto,\r\nand the tax on the export of silver (comisos). Persons assisting in\r\nthe apprehension of violators of these laws were rewarded with a part\r\nof the proceeds of the fine, the remainder becoming the property of\r\nreal hacienda. On October 6, 1783, the final jurisdiction in cases\r\nof smuggling and non-payment of the king's fifth was taken from the\r\naudiencia, appeals being authorized to the Council of the Indies. [203]\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the services of an oidor as\r\nspecial auditor de guerra. This, as well as other matters relating to\r\nthe jurisdiction of the governor and captain-general over military\r\nmatters, wherein the audiencia had no authority, will be noted when\r\nan examination is made of the relations of the governor and audiencia\r\nin a subsequent chapter. Suffice it to say here that the audiencia\r\ndid not have jurisdiction as a court over soldiers or military affairs.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the subject of the defense of the Islands, and\r\nthe exercise of judicial authority over soldiers was the special\r\njurisdiction which the governor had over matters relating to the\r\nChinese. This subject will be treated in greater detail when we\r\ndiscuss the relations of the audiencia and the governor.\r\n\r\nDuring the first two centuries of its existence the audiencia had\r\njurisdiction as a judicial tribunal in the cases and instances which\r\nhave been noted. It had civil and criminal authority, original and\r\nappellate. Its decisions were final in civil suits on claims for six\r\nthousand pesos or less. Criminal cases were settled in the audiencia.\r\n\r\nThe judicial authority of the audiencia was impeded during the greater\r\npart of its history by the failure of the government to entrust it\r\nwith complete jurisdiction in all civil and criminal matters, and\r\nby the tendency of the latter to interfere in matters of minute and\r\ninsignificant detail, which should have been left to the magistrates\r\nof the tribunal. The Constitution of 1812 and the reforms made in\r\npursuance thereof really effected the changes which had long been\r\nneeded. The audiencia's jurisdiction was made final in all civil suits\r\nand increased in administrative cases; thereafter no appeals were\r\nmade to the Council of the Indies unless they involved administrative\r\nlaw. Cases involving official dishonesty, incapacity, residencia,\r\npesquisas, treason, disputes between audiencias and other tribunals\r\nover conflicts of jurisdiction, and questions of the interpretation of\r\nthe law were still carried to Spain. These were important steps for the\r\nimprovement of colonial judicial procedure; they served to simplify it,\r\npreventing a multiplicity of cases from being carried to Spain which\r\nshould have been settled within the colony. These tardy reforms left to\r\nthe home government more time in which to occupy itself with questions\r\nof governmental policy, leaving to the audiencias more authority\r\nand responsibility in purely judicial matters, thus giving to them\r\na greater prestige in the commonwealths wherein they were situated.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications for the magistracy were also raised at this time,\r\nalthough it cannot be said that the magistrates of the audiencias were\r\nat any time incompetent or lacking in ability. The audiencias of the\r\ncolonies were given equal status with those of the Peninsula, and were\r\nthus elevated in dignity and standing to the rank of tribunals of the\r\nfirst order. The chief defects of the colonial judicial system of the\r\nseventeenth century were thus corrected, though somewhat tardily. It is\r\nunfortunate indeed that these changes applied only to a mere skeleton\r\nof Spain's former colonial empire.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we have discussed the audiencia as a formal court of\r\njustice, with methods, practices, and traditions little different from\r\nthose of any tribunal of justice. However, it had judicial authority\r\nmore extensive and far-reaching than has yet been indicated. Among the\r\ndifferent kinds of cases over which the audiencia had jurisdiction,\r\nperhaps none was more important, and certainly none was more\r\nexclusively peculiar to the Spanish judicial system than suits of\r\nresidencia. So distinct and extraordinary was that phase of judicial\r\nactivity that it merits consideration apart from a discussion of the\r\naudiencia's functions as an ordinary court of law. In the following\r\nsection we shall note its jurisdiction as an administrative court over\r\nsuits wherein the government was a party and wherein the object was\r\nnot only to punish offenders, but to act as a preventive of official\r\nmisconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE AUDIENCIA; THE RESIDENCIA [204]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the residencia was to uphold the morale of colonial\r\nservice by making officials answer for all their acts in a judicial\r\nexamination held at the close of their terms. It may be said that\r\nthe fear of the residencia was almost the sole incentive to righteous\r\nofficial conduct or efficient public service, and it will be seen that\r\nthe audiencia exercised very pronounced authority in this. Indeed,\r\nthe audiencia had general supervision in a semi-judicial capacity over\r\nthe services of officials and public servants in the colonies. It was\r\nthe function of the audiencia to send reports to the court relative\r\nto the conduct, work, or attitude of any employee or official of the\r\ngovernment, or of any resident of the colony. These reports were known\r\nas informaciones (pareceres) de servicio. [205] The tribunal itself\r\nwas ready at all times to hear complaints against provincial governors\r\nand judges, treasury officials, magistrates, governors, or, in fact,\r\nany and all officials holding their positions by virtue of the king's\r\ncommission. [206] Charges might be made by a wronged party or by anyone\r\nwhose knowledge of an abuse was sufficient to justify charges. Heavy\r\npenalties were imposed upon persons making false or unsubstantiated\r\ncharges. [207] Complaints against alcaldes mayores and corregidores\r\nwere most likely to be made during the regular investigation of the\r\nvisiting oidor, which, as we have noted, occurred every three years,\r\nbut sufficient complaint might be made to justify the dispatch of a\r\nspecial investigator at any time. [208]\r\n\r\nThe findings of the above inspections might be reviewed by the\r\naudiencia and lead to the suspension and dismissal of the official\r\nunder investigation. [209] The final action had to be confirmed by\r\nthe Council of the Indies in case the person concerned were a royal\r\nappointee, but in these matters the action of the local officials was\r\nusually approved. For the removal of oidores and oficiales reales a\r\nslightly different method was pursued. A magistrate of the audiencia\r\nwas designated to investigate the case, the evidence was submitted to\r\nthe Council of the Indies and final action was taken by it and not by\r\nthe audiencia. [210] Any and all charges brought against an official\r\nin these investigations, even though he were cleared at the time,\r\nmight be revived in the residencia.\r\n\r\nSuspensions from office were made by the governor with the advice and\r\nconsent of the audiencia. The governor had the legal right to make\r\ntemporary removals, but on account of the seriousness of such an act,\r\nand the considerations depending upon it, he usually preferred to\r\nhave the support of the magistrates in the matter. The governor, as\r\nvicepatron, could suspend prelates and other church officials, but he\r\nseldom, if ever, exercised his powers to the full extent. The audiencia\r\nat Manila, on the other hand, actually drove the archbishop from the\r\ncity on various occasions. The suspension and the removal of members\r\nof the ordinary clergy from their districts was a frequent occurrence,\r\nbut churchmen were not subject to residencia. The audiencia had no\r\nauthority to suspend or remove the governor, though the magistrates\r\ncould and frequently did bring charges against the governor which led\r\nto his dismissal. Governors actually suspended and removed oidores at\r\ntimes, though such acts were protested as violations of the law which\r\nauthorized only the Council of the Indies to remove these officials.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the procedure in making these removals was as follows:\r\nthe governor and audiencia investigated the conduct of an official\r\nwhenever circumstances demanded it; the latter was either suspended\r\nand recommended for removal, such recommendations being made by the\r\naudiencia to the governor or to the Council of the Indies, according\r\nto the rank of the official, or the tribunal could make the removal\r\nitself. [211] If exception to the action of the audiencia were taken,\r\nall the papers relative to the case were forwarded to the Council of\r\nthe Indies, and if good reasons were found to exist for the action\r\nof the lower court the Council approved its action. [212] This,\r\nwas not the residencia as usually considered.\r\n\r\nOf the various authorities at our disposal, Bancroft gives the most\r\nacceptable characterization of the residencia. He defines it as an\r\nexamination held, or an account taken, of the official acts of an\r\nexecutive or judicial official within the province of his jurisdiction\r\nduring the term of his incumbency. This, Bancroft says, was done\r\nat the expiration of the term of office or at stated periods, or,\r\nin case of malfeasance, at any time. [213] The principle underlying\r\nthe institution of the residencia was bequeathed to the Spaniards\r\nby the Romans, being similar to and probably derived from their law\r\nwhich gave the right of accusation to any Roman citizen against an\r\noffice-holder. The residencia was conducted by a judicial official,\r\nand it combined the features of a general survey of the career of the\r\nofficial under investigation, an auditing of his accounts and a formal\r\ntrial. Its purpose was to ascertain whether or not the official had\r\nfaithfully executed his duties and it served to clear him if he were\r\nproved honest, giving him a clean certificate of recommendation. If\r\nhe were found guilty of official misconduct or dishonesty he was\r\napprehended, degraded, and punished, according to his deserts.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bourne has written in regard to the residencia:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The residencia ... was an institution peculiar in modern times of\r\n    the Spanish colonial system. It was designed to provide a method\r\n    by which officials could be held to strict accountability for\r\n    all acts during their term of office.... To allow a contest in\r\n    the courts involving the governor's powers during his term of\r\n    office would be subversive of his authority. He was then to be\r\n    kept in bounds by realizing that a day of judgment was impending,\r\n    when everyone, even the poorest Indian, might in perfect security\r\n    bring forward his accusation. In the Philippines the residencia for\r\n    a governor lasted six months and was conducted by his successor\r\n    and all the charges made were forwarded to Spain.... The Italian\r\n    traveller Gemelli Careri who visited Manila in 1696 characterizes\r\n    the governor's residencia as a \"dreadful Trial\", the strain of\r\n    which would sometimes \"break their hearts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Bourne stated that it was the opinion of De Pons that\r\n\"the severities of the residencia could be mitigated, and no doubt\r\nsuch was the case in the Philippines. By the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury the residencia seems to have lost its efficacy.\" [214]\r\n\r\nIt is important to note at the outset that the residencia was not\r\nconducted periodically alone, but that it might be held at any time\r\nin the career of an official. The term pesquisa was applied to the\r\nform of residencia which was carried out by a special investigator\r\n(pesquisidor), sent when serious charges were made against the conduct\r\nof an official. [215] In the investigation which took place the\r\nofficial might be fined, or if grave offenses were proved, he might be\r\nremoved from office. Appeals might be made from the pesquisidor to the\r\naudiencia and to the Council of the Indies. In fact, the judgments of\r\nthe pesquisidor were always reviewed in the local tribunal unless the\r\ninvestigating judge had been commissioned by the Council of the Indies.\r\n\r\nThe distinction which has been made here between the formal residencia\r\nwhich occurred at the close of the term of office and the pesquisa\r\nwhich might take place whenever serious charges were made, was first\r\nemphasized in laws promulgated by Charles V in 1538, and by Philip\r\nII in 1591; these aimed to put a stop to the excesses of certain\r\ngovernors, corregidores, and ministers of justice, who, relying on\r\nthe practice then prevailing of taking residencias only at the close\r\nof the official term, had committed unlimited excesses. The new laws,\r\nabove referred to, stated that although it had never been the royal\r\nwish that residencias of royal appointees should be taken without\r\nnotice having been sent first to the monarch, the above circumstances\r\nhad made it necessary for them to be taken when charges were made. This\r\ncédula, therefore, authorized the taking of residencias whenever the\r\nbest interests of the service required it. [216]\r\n\r\nThis cédula was followed by another which forbade the sending of\r\nspecial investigators or judges of residencia against governors of\r\nprovinces, unless persons of responsible character presented charges\r\nagainst them, giving bonds to cover the costs. An investigator\r\nwas thereupon sent to conduct the trial of the official under\r\nexamination. [217] This matter is covered in slightly different\r\nterms in the law of June 19, 1620. According to that enactment, a\r\nreceptor [218] might be sent to conduct the preliminary investigations\r\nof corregidores and ordinary justices when these demanded instant\r\nattention and could not await the formal residencia. If, as a result\r\nof this inquiry, the guilt of the official seemed apparent, a more\r\ncomplete investigation was made by a judge appointed by the president\r\nand audiencia in acuerdo. [219]\r\n\r\nThe authority to determine whether cases merited investigation or\r\nnot and whether an inquiry should be made, belonged to the acuerdo,\r\nwhile the designation of the judge rested with the governor. [220]\r\nThe judges sent on these missions were not at first authorized to\r\npass final sentence, their decisions being subject to review in the\r\naudiencia before execution. However, by the law of May 5, 1576, this\r\nadded authority was bestowed upon the oidores who conducted special\r\ninvestigations, or residencias. [221] Appeals might be made to the\r\naudiencia and, if the sentence imposed the death penalty or permanent\r\nremoval from office, the appeal might be carried to the Council of the\r\nIndies. [222] The final approval of the Council was required before\r\naction could be taken with regard to any royal appointee, except in\r\nthose cases wherein the fine did not exceed one thousand pesos. [223]\r\n\r\nThe oidores, it seems, did not always act as impartial judges when\r\nentrusted with these investigations; they were often influenced\r\nby the extra reward obtained for these services, and frequently by\r\nprejudice against the officials under investigation. Such were the\r\ncharges implied by Governor Fajardo in 1619 when he wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is always to be believed that the auditors (oidores) to whom the\r\n    inquiries are entrusted, ought to make them, not only as judges,\r\n    but as interested parties, so that sinister inquiries should not\r\n    be sent to your Majesty's royal Council to defraud your royal\r\n    treasury and the merits of those who have served well. I assure\r\n    your Majesty that I have heard that many inquiries have been made\r\n    with less justification than might be advisable. [224]\r\n\r\n\r\nA typical illustration of the jurisdiction of the audiencia in an\r\ninvestigation of this sort, and of the delay to which the minor\r\nofficials were subjected, is shown in the case of Antonio Pimentel,\r\ngovernor of the Marianas, [225] whose residencia was taken in the\r\ndecade following 1711. In this case may be seen the distinction between\r\nthe formal residencia, conducted at the close of the regular term of\r\noffice, and an investigation of charges brought during the incumbency\r\nof the official. This case illustrates both forms of investigation,\r\nfor it originated in a charge of treason brought against Pimentel,\r\nwho, it was said, had furnished food and water to the crews of two\r\nEnglish vessels, enemies of Spain, and subsequently these same ships\r\nhad captured the galleon, \"Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación\". The\r\nconduct of the case was given to magistrate Torralba, who, on his\r\narrival at Guam, sent Pimentel in chains to Manila. Notwithstanding\r\nhis defense of ignorance of a state of war existing between Spain\r\nand England, he was sentenced to the forfeiture of the bonds which\r\nhe had posted on assuming office, and in addition was deprived of\r\nhis position as governor at Guam. This sentence was rendered January\r\n23, 1712, and was approved by the audiencia in review on July 24,\r\n1714. [226] The tribunal sentenced Pimentel to prison and ordered\r\nthat his residencia should be taken; accordingly, an examination\r\nwas made of all his official acts as governor. Pimentel, therefore,\r\nhad not only to stand investigation for the particular act which had\r\nbrought about his removal, but he was also subjected to a residencia\r\ncovering his entire career as governor. It may be noted that the two\r\nforms of investigation were separate and distinct on this occasion.\r\n\r\nOwing to the death of Governor Lizárraga, to the imprisonment of Oidor\r\nVilla, and to the state of anarchy surrounding the administration\r\nof Torralba as governor, Pimentel was forced to languish in prison\r\nseveral years while he waited residencia. The appointment of Luís de\r\nTagle as his successor and judge of residencia was dated June 25,\r\n1717. This occasion was one on which the successor of a governor\r\ntook his predecessor's residencia, owing, the commission said, to\r\nthe distance and the irregularity of communication between Manila\r\nand Guam. A letter of the audiencia, dated August 9, 1718, advised\r\nthe governor that there were 427 unfinished cases on the docket of\r\nthe tribunal, and chief among those that ought to be decided without\r\ndelay was the review of the residencia of Pimentel; it was added\r\nthat there seemed to be no prospect that a boat could get to Guam\r\nbefore 1719. The record of the termination of this case probably\r\nreposes somewhere in the archives, tied in an aged, yellow packet,\r\nbound by Spanish red tape.\r\n\r\nIn summary, it may be said that there were two kinds of investigations\r\nof official conduct, one taken at the completion of the regular term\r\nof office and the other at any time when the needs of the service\r\nrequired it. They both had the same ultimate purpose of holding\r\nofficials responsible for misconduct in office, of giving to all\r\npersons an opportunity of having justice done to them and of deterring\r\noffice-holders from future misdeeds.\r\n\r\nPractically all of the colonial officials were subject to\r\nresidencia. The most sensational and widely known residencias were,\r\nof course, those of viceroys and captains-general, but oidores,\r\ntreasury officials, encomenderos, alcaldes mayores, corregidores,\r\nadmirals, generals, captains, and constructors of galleons were\r\nlikewise examined in this way. [227] The visitors and special\r\ninvestigators who were sent to examine the government of the provinces\r\nand the state of the Indians on the encomiendas were also subject\r\nto residencia. Residencias were exacted of all minor officials at\r\nthe same time that their superiors were examined. [228] Clerks,\r\nnotaries, secretaries, alcaldes ordinarios, regidores, and other\r\nofficials of a minor category were investigated at the same time that\r\nthe governor was examined, an alcalde or an oidor being delegated by\r\nthe new president to review their official conduct. The examination of\r\nthese minor officials seems to have become more and more perfunctory\r\nand there was a tendency during the latter part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury to continue them in office, even without investigation. When,\r\nfor instance, Governors Basco y Vargas and Marquina gave up their\r\noffices this formality was omitted. [229] The practice of taking the\r\nresidencias of minor officials was definitely abandoned on August 24,\r\n1799, and a rigid inspection by the audiencia of their official acts\r\nwas authorized. [230]\r\n\r\nMuch contradictory legislation appears in the laws of the Indies\r\nrelative to the method of taking residencias; this due to the\r\nreforms made from time to time. These laws were formulated for a\r\ngrowing empire. A chronological review of them will show that the\r\nresidencia was at first more or less of an experiment. Indeed, all\r\nthe colonial institutions were in the early periods passing through\r\nan experimental stage and these seemingly contradictory laws were\r\npromulgated or repealed, according to their success or failure when put\r\ninto effect. Whenever, therefore, two laws appear to be in conflict,\r\nthe one of later date will be found to supersede and repeal the earlier\r\none. [231] In illustration of this characteristic of the laws of the\r\nIndies we may note the following example: The cédula of December 4,\r\n1630, ordered that the residencia of the governor should be taken\r\nby his successor. This law was seldom, if ever, observed. Owing to\r\nthe distance from Spain and New Spain, and the consequent length\r\nof time consumed in voyages, to the unhealthful climate, and to the\r\ndangerous military campaigns in which the governors were compelled\r\nto engage, death frequently intervened before the successor of a\r\ngovernor arrived. These conditions (which were characteristic of\r\nall of Spain's colonies) did not prevent the residencia from being\r\ntaken, but caused the law to be modified by the cédula of December\r\n28, 1667, according to which judges for the residencias of viceroys\r\nand presidents-governor and captains-general were to be designated\r\nby the court. The period of four months, which had been authorized\r\nfor the taking of residencias by the cédula of August 30, 1582, was\r\nextended to six months. [232] A change was necessary, the new law\r\ndeclared, in order to put a stop to the incessant strife, and the\r\nmalice which had been shown by viceroys, governors, and ministers in\r\nthe taking of residencias. The king determined that henceforth the\r\njudge of residencias should be designated by the court. The magistrate\r\nusually named was the decano. After 1776 the regent almost invariably\r\nconducted these investigations. The important reform of August 24,\r\n1799, ordered that judges of residencia for governors, viceroys,\r\npresidents, governors-intendant, corregidor-intendants, and presidents\r\nof the Council of the Indies should be appointed by the king. [233]\r\n\r\nThe first residencia to be conducted in the Philippines in accordance\r\nwith the new law of November 28, 1667, was that of Governor Salcedo,\r\nin 1670. This governor had been removed by the commissary of the\r\nInquisition on October 10, 1668, and Francisco Coloma, the decano,\r\nwas ordered to take his residencia. [234] Coloma's intervention in the\r\nmatter was protested by the audiencia in a letter to the Council of the\r\nIndies, dated April 7, 1670, on the grounds that the senior oidor was\r\nalso the asesor and possible successor of the governor, and for that\r\nreason he was disqualified from taking the latter's residencia. [235]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia suspended the proposed action of Coloma, pending the\r\nreply of the Council of the Indies. In addition to the protest of\r\nthe audiencia, the fiscal, on May 20, 1670, sent a report of the\r\ncase to the court, which act was in fulfillment of his regular\r\nduties as fiscal, as prescribed by the laws of the Indies. [236]\r\nThe notes from Manila were effective in bringing about the desired\r\nresults. Upon receipt of the communications, the Council of the\r\nIndies, on June 17, 1671, ordered the nullification of all former\r\ncédulas, cancelled Coloma's appointment to take the residencia in\r\nquestion, on the grounds that he had been the governor's asesor,\r\nand appointed Fernando de Montemayor, the oidor next in rank, to\r\nconduct the residencia of the governor. [237] Salcedo had already\r\nbeen dead three years, and two more transpired before his residencia\r\nwas completed and the autos thereof reviewed by the Council.\r\n\r\nThe laws provided ample opportunity for appeal in cases of\r\nresidencia. The cédula of November 17, 1526, ordered that appeals\r\nmight be made to the Council of the Indies from judges of residencia\r\nin cases involving liabilities in excess of 600 pesos. [238] Many\r\nappeals were made to the Council in accord with this law, and the\r\ntime of the tribunal was consumed in the consideration of matters\r\ncomparatively of small importance. To obviate this defect the law was\r\nchanged on August 7, 1568, to provide that no case could be appealed\r\nto the Council of the Indies unless the sentence imposed capital\r\npunishment or deprivation of office. [239] The cédula of June 23,\r\n1608, ordered that if the fine imposed upon the governor and ministers\r\nof the Philippines did not exceed one thousand pesos the case should\r\nbe finished in the audiencia. [240] Cases involving a greater amount\r\nwere to be appealed to the Council. Sentence of judges of residencia\r\nwere not to be executed pending the trial of appeals to the audiencia\r\nand the Council of the Indies. [241]\r\n\r\nPhilip IV initiated further reforms in regard to appeal in\r\n1636. Ordenanza LVI, promulgated at that time, provided that \"the said\r\nCouncil [of the Indies] may only have jurisdiction over the visits and\r\nresidencias of the viceroys, presidents, oidores, and officials of our\r\naudiencias and accountants and officials of the tribunals of accounts,\r\nofficials of the treasury and those of the governors provided by the\r\nCouncil with our titles.\" [242] Ordenanza LXII, issued at the same\r\ntime, ordered that \"in the visits and residencias which are seen\r\nand determined in our Council of the Indies,\" cases did not have to\r\nbe referred to the king for consultation, excepting when, in \"the\r\nresidencias of viceroys, presidents, and oidores, alcaldes del crimen,\r\nand fiscales of our royal audiencias of the Indies and governors of\r\nthe principal provinces there, condemnations of corporal punishment,\r\nprivation or suspension from office result against them.\" [243]\r\nIn these cases the Council was ordered to submit its decisions and\r\nall papers bearing thereon to the king before passing judgment,\r\nso that the final judgment might be rendered by the sovereign in\r\nperson. The Council could take final action in the residencias of\r\nmilitary and naval officials without consulting the king. It was, of\r\ncourse, impossible for the sovereign to give his personal attention\r\nto any of these matters, but the last word was pronounced in these\r\nsuits by responsible ministers of the court who stood high in the\r\nroyal estimation.\r\n\r\nOfficials were usually obliged to submit to residencia before leaving\r\nthe colony, also before their promotion to higher posts. [244] Owing,\r\nhowever, to the paucity of ships plying to New Spain and to the length\r\nof time elapsing between sailing dates, officials could give bonds and\r\nleave before the residencia was completed. [245] This was permitted\r\nonly to men of good character, whose services had been uniformly\r\nsatisfactory, and who were destined to some other post wherein their\r\nservices were indispensable. The investigation was then conducted in\r\nthe absence of the official concerned. [246] It was decreed by the\r\ncédula of December 30, 1776, that an annual deduction of one-fifth of\r\nthe total salary of the governors and viceroys respectively should\r\nbe made, until sufficient money had been taken out to cover the\r\nprobable costs and liabilities of their residencias. [247] This was a\r\nspecial assessment, distinct from the media anata, [248] and the money\r\ndeducted thereby was to be returned if nothing detrimental were proved\r\nin the residencia. The last year's salaries of alcaldes mayores and\r\ncorregidores were withheld, pending investigations of their official\r\nconduct and a rendering of accounts of collections made by them. [249]\r\nIf an official were cleared of all guilt, the money which had been\r\nwithheld was returned and the costs of residencia were defrayed by\r\nthe royal treasury. [250] In case the official were found guilty\r\nof misconduct, he had to forfeit his deposits, back-salary, bonds,\r\nand frequently to pay a large fine in addition. The amount of the\r\npenalty, of course, depended on the extent of the guilt. It may be\r\nsaid that in the Philippines the royal treasury suffered no serious\r\nembarrassment through having to bear costs of residencia.\r\n\r\nThe judges of residencia who served as such in addition to their\r\nregular duties, received an additional compensation which varied\r\naccording to the place where the residencia was held, its distance\r\nfrom the capital, and other circumstances. [251] This was modified by\r\na reform of the nineteenth century which awarded extra pay only in the\r\ncase the official were fined. This, of course, was intended to afford\r\nthe examining judge a stimulating interest in the case. Still later\r\nthe system of giving extra pay for residencias was abolished. [252]\r\n\r\nA detailed survey of the governor's residencia in the\r\nPhilippines would illustrate the influence of the audiencia in such\r\ninvestigations. Unfortunately the story would be long and little space\r\nremains for such a purpose. During the first two centuries of Spanish\r\nrule in the Islands the residencias of the governors were especially\r\nstringent, many of these officials suffering deprivation of office,\r\nimprisonment, and exile. The families and dependents of some were\r\nreduced to the last extreme of poverty, while the victims themselves\r\nspent years in some distant province, unable to defend themselves\r\nfrom their enemies. Many victims of the residencia were purposely\r\nput aside in order that no appeal could be heard from them. One would\r\noccasionally find relief at last in a tardy pardon or in a modification\r\nof sentence, obtained through friends at home, when these could be\r\nreached, but more often death would intervene before the exercise of\r\nexecutive clemency or revision of sentence could be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe factors of petty spite, malice, and personal ambition entered to\r\nan extensive degree in the rendering of testimony at a residencia. A\r\ngovernor, recently arrived in the colony, would be full of zeal\r\nand ardor to inaugurate a successful administration, and make a\r\ngood record for himself. The first duty that presented itself on\r\nhis arrival was that of taking or supervising his predecessor's\r\nresidencia. Frequently, before arriving at Manila, the new governor\r\nwould be in full possession of a complete record of the misdeeds\r\nof his predecessor, and the residencia of the latter was as good as\r\ntaken. [253] Oidores, merchants, alcaldes, treasury officials, and\r\nchurchmen, compelled to stand aside and see a governor take his choice\r\nout of the best things, leaving for them only the husks, were not slow\r\nin bringing charges at the official residencia. [254] A new governor,\r\ndesirous of demonstrating his intention of starting an honest and\r\nvigorous administration, hearing nothing but evil of his predecessor,\r\nwould naturally lend himself as an instrument to the malcontents. A\r\nfiscal, after spending six years in conflict with a governor, could be\r\ndepended on to bring strenuous prosecution against him. A magistrate\r\nwith enmity in his heart for the governor whose residencia he was to\r\ntake, was no fit person to conduct an impartial investigation.\r\n\r\nWhile as a rule the residencias of governors were severe,\r\ndue largely to the presence of the audiencia, that of Dr. Sande,\r\nthe first governor to submit to this investigation, illustrates\r\nthe evils of the residencia as conducted before the establishment\r\nof the audiencia. His successor, Governor Ronquillo de Peñalosa,\r\nconducted Sande's residencia and sentenced him to pay a heavy fine,\r\nbut he appealed the case to the Audiencia of Mexico, by which tribunal,\r\nin the meantime, he had been commissioned oidor. We have noted in an\r\nearlier chapter Ronquillo's comments on the abject state into which\r\nthe administration of justice had fallen when a man could be promoted\r\nto a magistracy in a tribunal which had jurisdiction over his own case\r\non appeal. [255] However, after the establishment of the audiencia,\r\nand until the close of the nineteenth century, the residencia went\r\nto the other extreme, and was, as a rule, exceedingly rigorous.\r\n\r\nWe may briefly note a few of the most severe residencias in which the\r\ninfluence of the audiencia told against the victim. In 1625, Gerónimo\r\nde Silva, temporary governor, was imprisoned by the audiencia because\r\nhe failed to pursue the Dutch after their defeat in 1617. The real\r\ndifficulty lay in the fact that Silva had incurred the enmity of the\r\nsenior oidor, who ultimately conducted the residencia, because Silva's\r\narrival in the Islands deprived that magistrate of the command of the\r\nmilitary and naval forces of the Islands. Again, Governor Corcuera,\r\nafter nine years of very successful rule, during which he distinguished\r\nhimself in several campaigns of conquest and incidentally aroused the\r\nhostility and jealousy of the oidores, was arrested on charges made\r\nby the audiencia on the arrival of Governor Diego Fajardo in 1644. An\r\noidor, who was the personal enemy of Corcuera, was designated to\r\nconduct the residencia, the ex-governor was fined 25,000 pesos and\r\nwas imprisoned five years while the magistrates of the audiencia\r\ndelayed the transmission of the papers which permitted a rehearing\r\nof the case. At last his defense was sent to the Council, the fine\r\nwas remitted, he was given salary for the period of his exile, and\r\nthe post of governor of the Canaries was conferred upon him. Although\r\nthe audiencia was responsible for the injustice in this case, Fajardo,\r\nas president and governor, was held answerable in his own residencia\r\nfor his conduct toward his predecessor.\r\n\r\nGovernor Simón de Anda y Salazar, one of the most successful\r\ngovernors the Islands had ever known, was made to suffer from the\r\npersonal malice of the oidores when he gave his last residencia in\r\n1776. [256] Among the offenses which were proved against him was\r\nthat of exercising prejudice in conducting the residencia of Oidor\r\nVillacorta, conducted under his supervision. The residencia had been\r\nrigorous, due no doubt to personal enmity between the oidor and the\r\ngovernor, extending over a period of many years. He was also fined\r\n4000 pesos as a price for his excessive zeal in the prosecution of\r\nthe residencia of his predecessor, Governor Raón, who had friends in\r\nthe audiencia to defend his memory and champion his cause. [257] Anda\r\nwas also shown to have absolved certain officials of real hacienda\r\nof financial responsibility, permitting them to leave the Islands\r\nwithout the consent of the audiencia. These and other charges proved\r\nagainst him were said to have caused his premature death in 1776.\r\n\r\nGovernor José Basco y Vargas, another very efficient governor,\r\n[258] but one who had been opposed throughout his term of office by\r\nthe audiencia, was heavily fined in 1787 by the oidor designated to\r\nconduct the investigation. The decision of the judge of residencia was\r\nreversed by the Council of the Indies, however, and Vargas' exceptional\r\nmerits were recognized to the extent of his being appointed to the\r\ngovernorship of Cartagena, with the rank of rear admiral. In taking\r\nthe residencia of Vargas, the audiencia had disagreed so completely\r\nthat the tribunal was obliged to resort to the extreme measure of\r\nappointing a churchman as arbiter. Fray Gerónimo Caraballo, the curate\r\nof Quiapo, was designated for that duty.\r\n\r\nAside from the above brief references to notable cases in which the\r\naudiencia exercised jurisdiction over the residencias of governors,\r\nallowing itself to be influenced by considerations other than those\r\nof justice, it seems desirable to review in detail at least one case\r\nof the residencia of a governor, to show more particularly just what\r\nauthority was exercised by the tribunal, and just how that authority\r\nwas exercised.\r\n\r\nWe may select for this purpose the residencia of Governor Felix\r\nBeringuer de Marquina, which was the last to be conducted under the\r\nold laws, and the last, accordingly, of the severe residencias. [259]\r\nAs governor and superintendent of real hacienda Marquina assumed\r\nsuch power as no other governor had ever exercised. He was opposed at\r\nevery turn by the audiencia and probably no other governor ever had\r\nso many of his measures vetoed or opposed by the home government as\r\nhe. The fiscal and oidores brought many charges against him; these\r\nfinally culminated, before the expiration of his term, in the royal\r\norder of February 19, 1792, for the taking of his residencia. The\r\nregent, Agustín de Amparán, was put in possession of the special\r\ncharges which had been made against Marquina. According to these the\r\ngovernor had been careless in defending the Islands against the Moros,\r\nwho had insulted and robbed with impunity the various settlements,\r\nwith no effort having been made to check their advance. The governor\r\nhad transgressed in numerous instances the sphere of the audiencia\r\nand had substituted his own authority. He was said to have been\r\nguilty of immoral relations with certain Spanish women of the colony,\r\nhaving deliberately and maliciously separated an intendant from his\r\nwife on one occasion by ordering the former to a post of duty where\r\nno woman could go; he had amassed a great fortune through trade and\r\nby diverting the proceeds of the royal revenue to his own private\r\nadvantage; he had permitted merchants to conduct business without\r\nproper licenses; he had allowed foreign merchants to remain in Manila\r\nunder conditions forbidden by law. [260] These and many others were\r\nthe charges brought against Governor Marquina. They may be considered\r\nas typical of the accusations which were usually brought against\r\ngovernors in their residencias.\r\n\r\nAmparán was commanded by the royal order above-mentioned to remove\r\nMarquina to some spot outside Manila where he could not interfere\r\nwith the residencia, but whence he could be summoned at any time,\r\nto give testimony in his own behalf. [261] The regent was instructed\r\nto ascertain from the treasury officials whether Marquina should not\r\nbe required to post more than the usual amount of bonds in view of\r\nthe grave charges against him. It seems that the law already cited\r\nrequiring an annual deduction of one-fifth of the governor's salary to\r\ncover residencia had been abrogated by a royal order dated February\r\n13, 1782; hence there was some apprehension lest Marquina had not\r\ndeposited sufficient money. [262]\r\n\r\nIn compliance with these orders Marquina was relieved of his office in\r\nSeptember, 1792, and was sent to Laguna de Bay, about thirty miles from\r\nManila. After five months' delay, the investigation was inaugurated\r\nand it was concluded by July 22, 1793, but Aguilar, the new governor,\r\nintervened and suspended the sentence on the ground that Marquina\r\nhad not been given sufficient opportunity to defend himself. Up to\r\nthis time Marquina had not testified directly. Aguilar ordered that\r\nthe ex-governor should be brought to Manila and that a lawyer should\r\nbe appointed for his defense. This was done and the charges which\r\nhad been made against him were duly answered. This evidence could\r\nnot be incorporated in the official papers of residencia, for they\r\nhad been finished and closed by the regent, but it was forwarded to\r\nSpain under separate cover. [263]\r\n\r\nThe official papers of Marquina's residencia, as formulated by the\r\nregent of the audiencia, arrived before the Council of the Indies\r\nin due time, together with Marquina's defense which had been sent\r\nseparately. The glaring injustice of the investigation as conducted\r\nby Amparán and of the official evidence transmitted, was patent to\r\nthe fiscal of the Council. He refused to receive any testimony not\r\nincorporated in the official papers of the case. Marquina was allowed\r\na retrial by the Council. This resulted in a further delay of three\r\nyears; during this period Marquina remained in the provinces with the\r\nexception of the time spent in Manila giving testimony in his second\r\nresidencia, which was taken under the direct supervision of Governor\r\nAguilar. Immediately after his second trial Marquina was transferred\r\nto Mexico, but he was obliged to deposit an additional 50,000 pesos\r\nbefore his departure from Manila.\r\n\r\nIn the ultimate judgment Marquina was pronounced guilty of many\r\noffenses in addition to those mentioned in the charges previously\r\noutlined. He had shown favoritism in the dispensation of official\r\nfavors; he had authorized the expenditure of public money for private\r\nends; he had neglected defense and agriculture; he had been negligent\r\nin the supervision of the various departments of real hacienda and\r\nparticularly of tobacco; he had infringed on the jurisdiction of the\r\nroyal audiencia. He had indulged in private trade and had granted\r\nspecial favors to foreign merchants. [264]\r\n\r\nThe regent fined him 40,000 pesos outright and, moreover, he was\r\ncondemned to pay into the royal treasury an additional fine of 16,000\r\npesos to cover certain illegitimate profits made through granting\r\nunlawful trading concessions to an Armenian merchant. This sentence\r\nwas not executed immediately, as it had to be confirmed by the Council\r\nof the Indies. On review of the findings and recommendations of the\r\nregent, the Council declared that since the proceedings at the trial\r\nof Marquina had been irregular and the governor had already suffered\r\nthe consequences of his own misdeeds, the fine imposed by the judge\r\nof the residencia in Manila might be reduced to 2000 pesos with costs\r\nof trial. Marquina on October 12, 1797, asked to be excused from\r\nthe payment of the 2000 pesos, but the Council denied his petition,\r\ndeclaring that he had been treated with great consideration and mercy\r\nand that nothing more could be done in his behalf, especially since\r\nhe had not been adjudged innocent of the charges which had been made\r\nagainst him. [265]\r\n\r\nMarquina's trial illustrates all the characteristics, the delays,\r\nterrors, and ramifications of a typical residencia of the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries. Continued complaints against him caused\r\nMarquina's residencia to be taken before the expiration of his\r\nofficial term. The regent of the audiencia was commissioned by the\r\ncourt to conduct the investigation because Marquina's successor\r\nhad not arrived. That magistrate was prejudiced against Marquina on\r\naccount of having witnessed the governor's continual malfeasance in\r\noffice. He was unable to conduct an impartial investigation, and\r\nthe audiencia, likewise prejudiced, would not intervene in behalf\r\nof the ex-governor. The wrongs done to Marquina in his trial were so\r\npatent that the Council of the Indies ordered a new hearing. A severe\r\nsentence was finally passed by the judge in Manila, but it was modified\r\nby the Council of the Indies through considerations of justice. The\r\nresidencia occupied ten years, and during the greater part of that\r\ntime the ex-governor remained in exile--a victim of his own misdeeds,\r\nthe faulty residencia system, and the hostility of the audiencia. The\r\ncustomary severity of the residencia was only mitigated in this case\r\nby the presence of an impartial governor, who, unlike most governors\r\nwhose desire was to harass their victims, sought to secure a fair\r\ntrial for his predecessor. To accomplish this he was obliged to work\r\nagainst, rather than in co-operation with the audiencia.\r\n\r\nThe above method of conducting residencias of governors, presidents,\r\nviceroys, and superintendents was modified, as already mentioned,\r\nby the reform of August 24, 1799. The new law provided that the\r\ncourt, instead of the new governor, should appoint the examining\r\njudge. The latter was no longer empowered to pronounce sentence of\r\nany sort. He was only to conduct the investigation in the future,\r\nremitting the autos of the case to the Council of the Indies\r\nfor final determination and sentence. [266] Again, on March 16,\r\n1797, the royal order of December 30, 1777, was re-enacted and the\r\npractice was revived of deducting annually one-fifth of the salaries\r\nof officials whose incomes were 8000 pesos a year or more. [267]\r\nThis law was again promulgated on January 18, 1848. Its purpose was\r\nto secure the retention of a sufficient sum of money to guarantee\r\nall losses incident to the residencia. It apparently continued in\r\nforce until July 7, 1860, when governors and captains-general were\r\ndeclared exempt from these discounts. [268]\r\n\r\nWe shall now examine more particularly the jurisdiction of the\r\naudiencia over the residencias of minor officials of the colony. It\r\nhas already been pointed out that the residencias of provincial\r\njudges and governors, alcaldes ordinarios and reales oficiales were\r\ntaken by judges appointed by the president of the audiencia, with\r\nappeal to the tribunal. These cases, under certain circumstances,\r\nmight be taken on second appeal to the Council of the Indies. The\r\npractice in these investigations may be best understood by noting the\r\ndevelopment of the law regarding them, for, as we have already noted,\r\nthe residencia was the product of years of administrative experience,\r\nduring which various methods were tried, and rejected or adopted as\r\nthey were found respectively inadvisable or efficacious.\r\n\r\nThe earliest cédula on the subject, that of November 17, 1526, ordered\r\nthat the audiencia should try all appeals from judges of residencia,\r\nwherein the amount involved did not exceed 600 pesos. A law of Philip\r\nII, dated 1563, forbade viceroys, presidents, and audiencias from\r\nsending judges of residencia or other investigators against judges of\r\nprovinces, unless complaint had been lodged against those officials by\r\na person willing to post bonds and pay the costs in case the charges\r\nproved to be false. [269]\r\n\r\nThe cédula of September 3, 1565, laid down the principle that the\r\nresidencias of officers appointed by viceroys and presidents should be\r\ntaken by commission of those who appointed them. [270] As regularly\r\nappointed corregidores and alcaldes mayores held royal commissions,\r\n[271] they did not, according to this law, give residencia to judges\r\nappointed by the governor. The Council of the Indies, therefore,\r\nshould name judges to investigate the official conduct of its own\r\nappointees. As a matter of fact, however, the Council delegated this\r\nauthority to the governor and audiencia. This latter practice was\r\nauthorized by a clause in the cédula of September 3, 1565, which\r\nprovided that residencias of the officials referred to should be\r\ntaken under supervision of the audiencias in the districts wherein\r\nthe officials resided. This meant that while the audiencia was not\r\nto interfere in the taking of the residencia itself, the tribunal\r\nwas to see that the laws regarding residencias were faithfully\r\nexecuted. The law of March 11, 1591, ordered that if the conduct of\r\ncorregidores, alcaldes mayores, and other magistrates demanded that\r\ntheir residencias should be taken before the completion of their term\r\nof office, the viceroys, presidents, or governors should appoint judges\r\nfor the purpose. [272] Nothing was said in this cédula relative to\r\nthe authority of the audiencia in this matter, but the law of January\r\n19, 1608, gave to the audiencia the right to try residencia cases on\r\nappeal from the sentences of these special judges.\r\n\r\nThe laws of June 3 and June 19, 1620, provided that the governor\r\nand audiencia should decide in acuerdo whether the residencia of a\r\ngobernador, corregidor, or an alcalde mayor should be taken. Neither\r\nthe governor nor the audiencia was to have complete authority in\r\nthe matter, but each should participate, the audiencia assisting in\r\nthe decision as to whether the case merited investigation and the\r\ngovernor making out the commission and appointing the judge if an\r\ninvestigation were necessary. The audiencia, alone, was authorized\r\nto appoint judges of residencia for judicial officers only. [273]\r\nThe interference of the audiencia in the residencias of governors,\r\ncorregidores, alcaldes mayores, and other justices and ministers\r\nprovided by royal appointment was definitely forbidden by the cédula\r\nof April 20, 1639, as this jurisdiction was declared to belong to\r\nthe Council of the Indies. [274] Although we have evidence that\r\nthe Council did exercise such jurisdiction, it was always on review\r\nof cases appealed from the audiencias. While the above prohibition\r\nforbade the audiencia from taking the residencias of these officials\r\nit did not restrain the tribunal from participating in the decision\r\nas to whether a residencia should be taken, or in the review of the\r\nautos of residencia.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the intervention of the Council of the Indies\r\nin residencias of alcaldes mayores is shown in the case of Josef\r\nTormento, alcalde of Caragara. On June 6, 1786, he was sentenced in\r\nresidencia to a pecuniary penalty, perpetual deprivation of office,\r\nand two years' exile from Manila. This sentence was confirmed in\r\nreview by the audiencia on October 8 of the same year. The Council\r\nmodified this sentence, however, approving the fine, but cancelling\r\nthe other provisions. [275] In 1803 the incumbent of the same post,\r\nAntonio Mateo, was incarcerated by order of the audiencia, pending\r\ninvestigation of the charge made against him that he had used\r\nthe funds of his office for private trade. It was shown, however,\r\nthat this official knew the location of a quicksilver deposit of\r\ngreat value, whereupon the governor had him removed from prison,\r\nordering the suspension of the charges against him, notwithstanding\r\nthe protests of the oidores. The fiscal concurred in the action of\r\nthe governor. The audiencia appealed the case to the Council of the\r\nIndies, alleging conspiracy between the governor and the fiscal. The\r\nCouncil, however, on examination of the case, approved their action,\r\nordered the charges to be dismissed, and gave directions that the\r\nalcalde mayor should be restored to his former position or given\r\nanother of equal category as soon as possible. [276]\r\n\r\nAlthough the cédula of August 24, 1799, gave the audiencia the right\r\nto conduct the residencias of corregidores and alcaldes mayores, this\r\ncase involved certain interesting features which should be pointed out\r\nin this connection. In the first place, it shows the manner in which\r\nthe Council of the Indies exercised ultimate authority in matters of\r\nresidencia. Again, it reveals the influence which the fiscal and even\r\nthe governor might have in determining whether suit should be brought,\r\n[277] and finally it indicates that expediency might constitute an\r\nimportant factor in the ultimate results of a case of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe practice of granting jurisdiction over the residencia of an\r\nofficial to the authority that appointed him seems to have been\r\nfollowed repeatedly. This principle was enunciated in the cédula of\r\nAugust 20, 1758, but on August 8, 1764, a royal decree authorized\r\nviceroys and presidents to name judges of residencia for all officials\r\nholding royal appointments, with the condition that the autos should\r\nbe forwarded to the Council of the Indies. This law was repealed on\r\nApril 23, 1769. [278]\r\n\r\nThe cédula of August 24, 1799, which has been mentioned several times\r\nin this chapter, was a reform of the greatest importance in the history\r\nof the residencia. Prior to its promulgation, all officials had to\r\ngive residencia, but this law abolished that universal requirement. It\r\nprovided that residencias of corregidores, alcaldes mayores, and\r\nsubdelegate-intendants should be taken only when charges had been\r\nmade against them. This might occur at any time during their term of\r\noffice, or at the close of their service. These investigations had to\r\nbe concluded within four months, but if charges were not made against\r\nan official his past record was not investigated.\r\n\r\nThe length of time consumed in all residencias except those of\r\nviceroys was limited to four months. The period allotted for these\r\ninvestigations was divided into two parts. [279] During the first half,\r\nedicts or notices of residencia were posted throughout the district\r\nof the official concerned. These were printed in Spanish and in the\r\ncommon dialect, so that natives and others concerned might read and\r\nknow that the official was giving up his post and that charges might\r\nbe brought against him, setting forth any misconduct, undue harshness,\r\ntyranny or dishonesty of which he had been guilty during his term\r\nof office. These notices invited them to register any complaints\r\nwhich they might wish to make and gave them sixty days in which to\r\ndo it. At the close of this period the judge of residencia opened an\r\ninvestigation in the town wherein the official under examination had\r\nresided, usually the capital of the province. The actual trial of\r\nresidencia might consume sixty days, or it might be perfunctory in\r\nits character and occupy a much shorter period, the entire question\r\nof time depending on the amount of evidence presented against the\r\nretiring official. On the other hand, as we have seen, the residencia\r\nof a governor might occupy ten years.\r\n\r\nIf the judge were taking a residencia in the provinces he was\r\nfrequently delayed in arriving at his post of duty, owing to the\r\npressure of other business, or to the uncertainty of transportation\r\nfacilities. In that event, he could not open the judicial investigation\r\nuntil the allotted period had almost transpired.\r\n\r\nIn the trial, two distinct lines of investigation were usually pursued:\r\ncharges which had been made against the official were investigated\r\nand the records of his office were examined. The discovery was\r\nfrequently made through this procedure that the official had embezzled\r\nmoney belonging to the government, usually investing it in private\r\nventures. The inquiry might show that he had been careless in the\r\nexecution of the duties of his office, remiss in his attention to\r\nencomiendas, particularly neglecting the Indians thereon, or too\r\nignorant and incompetent to try properly, record, and transmit the\r\nautos of the cases which had come to him in first instance. These\r\ndefects might not become apparent until they were revealed in this\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe judge of residencia would seem to have been well occupied during\r\nthe time that he was conducting the investigation. He received and\r\nreviewed all charges made. In addition to auditing the records of\r\nthe office, he had to pursue inquiries as to the truth of these\r\ncharges. He examined witnesses both for and against the defendant,\r\nand was supposed to give the official under investigation every\r\nopportunity to defend himself. He was relieved, however, of the\r\ntrouble and responsibility of checking up the financial accounts of the\r\nofficial under residencia. This important matter was turned over to the\r\ntreasury officials, who ascertained shortages, and held the bondsmen\r\nof the official under investigation responsible. [280] The judges\r\nof residencia, and the oidores making investigations and reviewing\r\ncases of residencia were ordered to confine their examinations to\r\n\"criminal and legal matters and charges which result against those\r\nunder residencia.\" [281]\r\n\r\nAfter all the evidence had been taken and the case had been duly tried,\r\nthe judge of residencia was authorized to render sentence. Sentences\r\nwere executed by the examining judge if the penalty did not\r\nexceed twenty-five thousand maravedís. The latter cases were not\r\nappealable. If the fine were less than two hundred ducats and the\r\ndefendant desired to appeal, he was obliged to pay the fine or deposit\r\nthe amount thereof. His case would then be reviewed by the audiencia\r\nand in order to effect this, notice of appeal had to be submitted in\r\nsufficient time to permit the record of the entire case to be reduced\r\nto writing. If, on review, the audiencia found that the defendant\r\nwas not guilty of the charges which had been brought against him,\r\nthe money taken as a fine or deposit was restored. If the amount\r\nof the fine exceeded two hundred ducats, or if the defendant had\r\nbeen convicted of serious crimes, the judge was authorized to take\r\nthe proper and necessary steps for the detention of the prisoner\r\nand the seizure of his property pending a new trial in the higher\r\ntribunal. [282] Cases involving more than one thousand pesos could\r\nbe carried to the Council of the Indies.\r\n\r\nA thoroughly typical case, illustrating all of the ramifications of\r\na provincial official's residencia, was that of Francisco Fernández\r\nZéndera, alcalde mayor and military captain of the province of\r\nIlocos. [283] It was investigated first by a judge appointed by the\r\nacuerdo, it was reviewed by the audiencia and it was finally carried\r\nto the Council of the Indies. It was characteristic in another sense,\r\nnamely, in that twelve years passed before the matter was settled.\r\n\r\nAfter Zéndera had occupied his post three years, complaints against\r\nhim were brought to the attention of the fiscal. In his capacity as\r\nprosecuting official and as protector of the Indians, he made a motion\r\nbefore the audiencia in acuerdo, that a judge of residencia should be\r\nsent to conduct an investigation of Zéndera's official conduct. The\r\nfollowing charges against Zéndera had been sent to the governor, and\r\non the basis of these, the fiscal, governor, and audiencia decided\r\nto conduct the investigation: First, Zéndera had compelled natives to\r\nwork for him on his own estates, building houses, granaries, fences,\r\ntilling the soil and planting crops, from two hundred to three hundred\r\nmen having worked for him continually, without pay or food; second,\r\nthe arbitrary methods of this alcalde mayor left the natives without\r\nmoney with which to buy their food or to pay their tribute; third,\r\nnot only were the men forced to labor, but the women were obliged to\r\nsew, spin and embroider without pay, and the product of their labor\r\nwas confiscated by the alcalde mayor.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia and the governor, in acuerdo, having taken note of\r\nthese charges, commissioned Angel Moguel, chief secretary of the\r\ngovernment, to conduct the residencia of the alcalde. Moguel was put in\r\npossession of the necessary documents and departed at once for Vigán,\r\nthe head city of the province. On November 7, 1782, he posted notices\r\nto the effect that Zéndera's residencia was to be taken, calling on\r\nthe residents to make formal charges against him. Moguel suspended\r\nZéndera from office and accepted 20,000 pesos from two of his friends\r\nas bonds to cover the residencia, this sum offsetting the valuation of\r\nthe properties for which Zéndera was responsible. These were additional\r\nto other bonds which Zéndera had posted on his accession to office.\r\n\r\nFor some unassigned reason, only twenty-five days were allowed for the\r\nfiling of complaints, but during this time eighty-eight charges were\r\nmade, most of which were variations of those mentioned above. Zéndera\r\nwas said to have been uncompromising in his administration of justice;\r\nhe had imposed excessive fines; he had imprisoned the natives without\r\ngiving them opportunities for defense; he had refused to allow them\r\nto appeal their cases. [284] Not being a lawyer, he lacked sufficient\r\nqualifications for the proper conduct of trials; moreover he had\r\nrefused to employ a teniente or asesor. He had failed to supervise\r\nand enforce the instruction of Spanish, and he had done nothing to\r\nassist in the education of the natives. Zéndera was charged with\r\nhaving suppressed all commerce except his own, going so far as to\r\narrest merchants of other provinces who came to Ilocos to trade. This\r\nhe had done to secure his own monopoly in commercial matters. He had,\r\nmoreover, suppressed the trade of the Ilocanos with the Igorrotes. He\r\nhad failed to segregate the men from the women in the provincial\r\nprison. It was said that he had neglected to publish the governor's\r\nedicts (bandos) from Manila. He had shown partiality to Spanish priests\r\nin preference to the native clergy. He was charged with having taken\r\nrice as tribute at a low price, turning it over to the treasury\r\nofficials at a higher rate, thereby making great profits for himself.\r\n\r\nZéndera was found guilty of almost every charge made against him. The\r\nsentence of residencia was pronounced by the judge commissioned for\r\nthe purpose on August 13, 1782. The defendant was fined 8000 pesos and\r\nsentenced to deprivation of office for a period of eight years. [285]\r\nThe audiencia, in turn, reviewed the case, and that tribunal, on May\r\n20, 1783, finding the autos of the case incomplete, ordered Moguel\r\nback to Vigán for a second time to complete the investigation. The\r\njudgment of residencia after this second investigation was made was\r\nthe same as before, and the case was carried to the Council of the\r\nIndies on November 7, 1785. It seems that in this case the audiencia\r\nwas somewhat slow in granting the appeal, for on February 19, 1788,\r\na cédula was expedited which ordered the audiencia to forward all the\r\nautos in its possession bearing on the case. The final judgment of the\r\nCouncil of the Indies was rendered March 23, 1794. The fine of 8000\r\npesos was reduced to 3000 pesos, and the portion of the sentence which\r\nhad ordered a deprivation of office was remitted altogether. [286]\r\n\r\nThe cédula of August 24, 1799, already referred to, greatly altered\r\nthe applicability of the residencias to provincial as well as\r\ninsular officials. Its greatest importance was due to the fact that\r\nit authorized investigations of corregidores, alcaldes mayores,\r\nand sub-delegate intendants only when charges were made against\r\nthem; otherwise it was assumed that their official conduct had been\r\nsatisfactory, and accordingly no residencias were held. Before the\r\nofficials could be transferred to other posts they were obliged to\r\nshow certificates of clearance from former positions. The audiencia\r\nwas given final jurisdiction over the residencias of these officials,\r\nwith inhibition of appeal. At the same time the tribunal was denied\r\njurisdiction in any instance over the residencias of viceroys,\r\ncaptains-general, presidents, governors, treasury officials, oidores,\r\nand intendants. [287] After the suppression of the Council of the\r\nIndies on March 24, 1834, the latter cases were finished in the\r\nSupreme Tribunal of Justice, and that tribunal continued to exercise\r\nthis jurisdiction till the close of the nineteenth century. [288]\r\n\r\nThe cédula above referred to abolished the residencias of tenientes\r\nletrados, alcaldes ordinarios, regidores, clerks, procurators,\r\nsyndics, alguaciles, and other minor officials. In place of the formal\r\ninvestigation and judgment after the term of office was completed,\r\nthe audiencia was given more complete control over their official acts,\r\nwith the duty of seeing that justice was administered, jails inspected\r\nand kept clean, prisoners given a speedy trial and not molested with\r\nundue exactions, and the police supervised. The tribunal was also\r\nempowered to see that the ayuntamientos conducted their elections\r\nimpartially and that the municipal officials executed their duties\r\nfaithfully. In this way the formal investigation at the close of\r\nthe term of these minor officials was replaced by a more efficient\r\nsupervision of their acts by the audiencia. The constitutional\r\nreforms of the early nineteenth century gave to the audiencia original\r\njurisdiction over the trial of judges of first instance, with appeal\r\nto the Supreme Tribunal of Justice. This authority was suppressed\r\nin 1815, and continued so until 1835, when it was restored to the\r\naudiencias of the colonies.\r\n\r\nAlthough the reform of August 24, 1799, recognized the residencias of\r\nalcaldes mayores, tenientes, and corregidores, merely transferring\r\njurisdiction over these to the audiencias, it would seem that this\r\ninvestigation retained less of its former severity from this time\r\nonwards. In fact, some authorities infer that the residencia was\r\nabolished after 1799. [289] This was not the case, however, as the\r\nresidencia was recognized by laws promulgated as lately as 1870. [290]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia also had jurisdiction over the residencias of galleon\r\nofficials. These had to submit to residencia at the termination of each\r\nvoyage. An oidor was designated by the governor for the inspection of\r\nthe ship, for the examination of its papers, for the consideration\r\nof complaints against the officers of ill-treatment of passengers\r\nand crews during the voyage. [291] An investigation was conducted on\r\nthe occasion of the loss of a ship. Then a thorough inquiry was made\r\nin an endeavor to discover negligence on the part of the admiral,\r\ngeneral, or other officials. The exercise of a similar authority\r\nover cases involving the loss of galleons has been discussed in the\r\npreceding chapter.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this authority, Magistrate Torralba was commissioned\r\nin 1710 to take the residencia of the officers of the galleon \"Nuestra\r\nSeñora del Rosario y San Vicente Ferrer\", which was wrecked in the\r\nStraits of San Bernardino on the voyage from Acapulco in 1709. [292]\r\nAs great diligence had been shown by them in landing the treasure and\r\nsending it overland, the matter was dropped. A similar investigation\r\nwas conducted in 1743 in the case of the galleon \"Cobadonga\", which\r\nwas captured by the British. The charge was made that neither the\r\n\"Cobadonga\" nor her convoy, \"El Pilar\", had offered any resistance,\r\nand that the latter had deserted the galleon and had taken refuge\r\nin flight. [293] The officers were arrested and thrown into prison\r\non charges brought by the fiscal, but they were cleared in the\r\ninvestigation which proved that the ships were not in a condition\r\nto fight.\r\n\r\nThe various laws and cases which have been cited in this chapter show\r\nthat the trial of residencia of captains-general, treasury officials,\r\noidores, intendants, alcaldes mayores, and alcaldes ordinarios was\r\na judicial function over which the audiencia had a large share of\r\nauthority. It is safe to say that no residencia was ever taken in\r\nthe Philippines, after the audiencia had been established there,\r\nin which that tribunal did not exercise some degree of authority. As\r\nthe laws and regulations of the residencia varied at different times,\r\nthe extent of the jurisdiction of the audiencia in this matter was\r\nnot always the same. The audiencia either assisted in the examination\r\nof the charges or in the designation of the judge. The magistrate\r\nselected was usually an oidor. Oidores were liable to designation to\r\nconduct inquiries, and the audiencia, as a tribunal, tried these cases\r\nin review. The tribunal exercised supervision over the work of the\r\ninvestigating judge. The case was either finished in the audiencia,\r\nor reviewed there and appealed to the Council of the Indies through\r\nthe action of the audiencia. The Council of the Indies was the supreme\r\narbiter in all cases, prior to 1799. Subsequently the Council, or the\r\nSupreme Tribunal of Justice after 1834, retained final jurisdiction\r\nover the residencias of the higher officials only. In the residencias\r\nof provincial or local officials the jurisdiction of the audiencia\r\nwas final.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE SEMI-JUDICIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE AUDIENCIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from the activities which have been described, the magistrates\r\nof the audiencia rendered important services in various administrative\r\ncapacities. From the beginning until the end of the eighteenth century\r\nthe oidores were assigned to special commissions or judgeships with\r\njurisdiction over such miscellaneous secular and ecclesiastical matters\r\nas did not come readily under any other department or authority. In\r\npractically all cases these functions involved the oidores in their\r\nindividual capacities rather than as magistrates of a tribunal of\r\njustice. Though their work was independent of the audiencia, their\r\ndecisions were reviewed in the audiencia in many cases. In short, it\r\nmay be said that when any unforeseen or unclassified matter came up\r\nfor solution, it was usually assigned to a magistrate of the audiencia.\r\n\r\nThe exercise of these extra functions was especially characteristic\r\nof the history of the audiencia down to 1785, when the reforms\r\nof the intendancy were introduced throughout the Spanish colonial\r\nempire. These important reforms grouped these administrative functions\r\nabout a central head, the superintendent, and lessened the duties\r\nof the oidores in these matters, confining the magistrates more\r\nparticularly to judicial duties. It may be said, however, that the\r\noidores exercised these extra functions practically till the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century, which period comprised the greater part of\r\nthe existence of the colonial audiencia.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Indies empowered the president of the audiencia\r\nto designate oidores to serve on these commissions. Additional\r\ncompensation and travelling expenses were given for these extra\r\nservices. [294] The president was forbidden to send magistrates on\r\ncommissions to places outside the district of the audiencia, which, of\r\ncourse, would have been impossible in the Philippines. Appointment to\r\nsome of these commissions was considered by the magistrates as highly\r\ndesirable. Frequent disagreements arose over these appointments, and\r\nthe king was obliged to issue pacificatory cédulas, from time to time,\r\nto allay the discord and strife which arose over the appointments\r\nto the more lucrative of these places. The principle was laid down\r\nrepeatedly that special commissions should be assigned fairly among\r\nthe ministers, and that in their distribution only the aptitude of\r\nthe magistrates for the particular tasks should be considered. [295]\r\nThe term of service for these special posts was a year. No change was\r\nallowed in the incumbency of a particular commission unless on account\r\nof death, sickness, or removal for incompetency. Appointments to these\r\nextra duties were made in the royal name, and appointees were obliged\r\nto make reports to the court on the termination of the commission\r\nheld. Magistrates were held responsible for their service in this\r\ncapacity in their residencias. In large audiencias such as Mexico,\r\nLima, and Buenos Ayres in the eighteenth century, many commissions\r\nof this character were served by regular commissioners who held no\r\nother posts, but in the smaller colonies such as the Philippines,\r\nPuerto Rico, and Cuba, they were held by oidores when the duties\r\nconnected with the commissions did not entail sufficient work to\r\noccupy all the time of the appointee.\r\n\r\nThe most important and profitable commissions were awarded to the\r\nsenior magistrate of the audiencia. He was charged permanently with\r\nthe duty of seeing that all the decrees, fines, and decisions of\r\nthe Council of the Indies were executed, collections being made\r\nin accordance with the instructions of that body. These included\r\nfines imposed in residencia and other penalties exacted on different\r\noccasions by the audiencia, or by the Council of the Indies. Among\r\nthe latter were confiscations of property and fines for smuggling,\r\nfor the illegal exportation of silver, and for the evasion of the\r\nking's fifth, [296] the alcabala and the almojarifazgo. The senior\r\nmagistrate was authorized to retain as compensation three per cent\r\nof the amount collected, and he was ordered to give account to the\r\naudiencia of collections made by him in accordance with the law. [297]\r\nAnother magistrate was asesor of the Santa Cruzada, and it was his duty\r\nto give legal advice and to act as special attorney for that department\r\nof ecclesiastical activity. [298] The president, fiscal, and the senior\r\noidor concurred in the acuerdos which treated of matters pertaining to\r\nreal hacienda. [299] This was known as the junta ordinaria. A tribunal\r\nof appeals above the junta ordinaria was created later, and in its\r\nactivities, also, the magistrates of the audiencia participated. [300]\r\nThe audiencia also heard judicially certain cases of appeal involving\r\nthe royal treasury, but magistrates who had participated in the junta\r\nmentioned above were not allowed to hear again the cases in which\r\ntheir previous vote had been given. Each oidor served in turn for the\r\nperiod of six months on the board of auctions. [301] Magistrates were\r\nappointed by the governor, yearly, in turn, to serve as inspectors\r\nof the government. In this capacity they were expected to examine\r\nand report on the administration of justice and on the work of the\r\naudiencia, the royal treasury and the officials connected therewith,\r\nvisitors, provincial officials and those of the city of Manila. The\r\ninspecting magistrate was authorized to examine the records of these\r\nofficials and to use any other legitimate means in performance of\r\nhis special duties. [302]\r\n\r\nAn oidor was designated by the president to make periodical inspections\r\nin the provinces. This official had to attend to a variety of matters\r\nwhile on visits of inspection. He was required to make a census\r\nof the towns, and inquire into the prosperity of the inhabitants;\r\nto audit the accounts of the town officials, and to see whether the\r\nprovincial governor or magistrate had been faithful in the execution\r\nof his duties. He was supposed to visit the encomiendas and note the\r\ntreatment of the Indians thereon, to find out whether the natives were\r\nproperly and sufficiently instructed, or whether they were permitted\r\nto remain in idolatry and idleness. He inspected the churches and\r\nmonasteries, seeing that they contained the requisite number of\r\nreligious and no more, and noting whether the natives under the charge\r\nof the ecclesiastics were well treated. In the same way he inspected\r\nthe curacies of the towns. The visiting oidor was especially required\r\nto give careful attention to the corregidores and alcaldes mayores,\r\ninspecting their judicial and administrative activities and holding\r\nthem responsible for any irregularities, especially with regard to\r\nthe treatment of the Indians. The visitor was required to inspect\r\ninns and taverns, to ascertain whether they observed the regular\r\ntariffs, and whether the drugs sold in the provinces were of good\r\nquality. He also inspected highways and bridges. If the visitor\r\nfound anything wrong he was authorized to take immediate steps, on\r\nhis own responsibility, to remedy the defects, reporting any action\r\ntaken to the audiencia without delay. As seen in the last chapter,\r\nthe immediate consequence of the visit was frequently the residencia\r\nof the official inspected. The visitor was provided with sufficient\r\nfunds to defray his expenses, so that he would not be a burden on the\r\nencomenderos or Indians. The president of the audiencia was forbidden\r\nto order visits to the same province more frequently than once every\r\nthree years, unless, after an investigation, such action was declared\r\nnecessary by vote of the acuerdo. [303]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia exercised supervision over certain matters of church\r\nfinance. These included tithes, the funds of temporalities, and of\r\ncertain charitable societies, and jurisdiction over the adjustment of\r\nestates and properties left by deceased prelates. In connection with\r\nthe latter was the duty of auditing the accounts of benefices which\r\nwere subject to the royal patronage whenever a transfer of occupants\r\nwas made. These matters, though miscellaneous in their character,\r\nand accordingly pertinent here, may be reserved for a subsequent\r\nchapter which will be dedicated to a discussion of the relations of\r\nthe audiencia and the Church.\r\n\r\nAn oidor in the Philippines served as judge of medias anatas. [304]\r\nThese taxes were levied upon the salaries of all officials of\r\nroyal appointment, except ecclesiastics, these exactions varying in\r\namount from one-half the first year's income to one-tenth of the\r\ngross salary of each official. The cédula of June 2, 1632, [305]\r\nordered the judge-commissioner of medias anatas to surrender the\r\nmoney which he had collected to the treasury officials who in turn\r\nwere to transmit it to Spain. [306] More definite information as to\r\nthe nature of the duties of the judge-commissioner of these funds may\r\nbe gathered from the cédula of December 14, 1776, by which Oidor Félix\r\nDíaz Quejada y Obrero was appointed as commissioner of medias anatas in\r\nthe Philippines. This magistrate was authorized to retain four per cent\r\nof all that he collected. This percentage, the cédula stated, was the\r\nsame as was paid to the commissioner of medias anatas of New Spain. The\r\ncédula ordered Quejada to collect this tax from all royal appointees,\r\nbut not from governors of towns or Indian caciques who were elected\r\nyearly, and who, of course, were not royal appointees. Appeals from\r\njudgments of the commissioner of medias anatas were to be entertained\r\nin the Council of the Indies only, and not in the audiencia. [307]\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out already in this chapter that the effect\r\nof the reforms of the intendancy was to limit the jurisdiction of\r\nthe oidores over special commissions. This is especially true of\r\nthose relating to finance. An illustration of this is shown in the\r\ndisputes which occurred between the oidores and the governor, over\r\nthe conservatorships of betel, [308] wine, tobacco, playing-cards,\r\nand cockpits. When these sources of income developed in the latter\r\npart of the seventeenth century, their supervision, as usual, had been\r\nconferred on oidores with title of asesores or jueces-conservadores\r\n(judge conservators). [309] This was done in disregard of the laws of\r\nthe Indies, wherein was expressed the desirability of conferring these\r\nassessorships, if possible, on properly qualified officials, other\r\nthan oidores. The magistrate holding a commission was to attend to\r\nthe legal duties and adjudicate all suits in connection therewith. The\r\nlatter regulation was made in order that when the cases were brought\r\nto trial the magistrate might not be incapacitated by having rendered\r\ndecisions in them ahead. The law continued in the following strain:\r\n\r\n\r\n    when a case so urgent and extraordinary offers itself that an\r\n    oidor must be appointed, warning is hereby given that ... the same\r\n    magistrate who tried the case originally may not be judge. [310]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis law conceded that oidores might serve when other magistrates\r\nwere not available.\r\n\r\nGovernor Marquina, superintendente subdelegado de real hacienda from\r\n1789 to 1793, refused to permit oidores to serve as asesores of the\r\nmonopolies of betel, wine, and tobacco. These magistrates claimed,\r\nhowever, that they were entitled to the appointments, since they\r\nhad occupied these positions before July 26, 1784, the date of the\r\ncreation of the intendancy in the Philippines. They conceded that\r\nthey had been relieved of jurisdiction over these rents on that date,\r\nand that the authority formerly exercised by them had been assumed by\r\nthe intendant. [311] By the cédula of November 23, 1787, however, the\r\nintendancy had been abolished and the government restored to \"the state\r\nand condition which had previously existed.\" [312] This would mean\r\nthat the oidores should again hold these asesorías, and on the basis\r\nof this reasoning they demanded that the governor should return them.\r\n\r\nThe oidores did not tamely submit to a deprivation of their posts as\r\nasesores on the occasion of the establishment of the intendancy. They\r\ncomplained to the king, alleging that these appointments belonged\r\nto them by their own right. The king inquired of Governor Basco y\r\nVargas why the oidores had not been designated for these duties. The\r\ngovernor replied that the supervision of the rents had been assumed by\r\nthe intendant, but that their direction belonged at that time to the\r\ngovernor and superintendent, by virtue of the cédula of November 23,\r\n1787. [313] He stated that the oidores had no right of their own to\r\nthese asesorías, since the faculty of appointing asesores had been\r\nconferred on the governor (or viceroy) by the laws of the Indies,\r\n[314] and in times past governors had appointed lawyers who were not\r\noidores. There was therefore no obligation on the part of the governor\r\nto give these places to oidores; indeed, the laws of the Indies had\r\nemphasized the undesirability of doing so. [315]\r\n\r\nBasco y Vargas, in pursuance of this conception of his rights and\r\nduties, combined all of these asesorías under the direction of one\r\noffice, placing them under the orders of his own asesor, leaving\r\noidores in charge of each minor asesoría, except that of tobacco,\r\nwhich was placed under the immediate direction of the governor's\r\nasesor. The king approved this action, giving the new official a\r\nnew title, that of asesor de todo lo directivo y lo económico de la\r\nsuperintendencia subdelegada de la real hacienda de Filipinas. [316]\r\nThe local authority appointed Magistrate Castillo y Negrete to this\r\nnew position at once, but the king, on the ground that the law [317]\r\nforbade an oidor to hold such an office, disapproved of the appointment\r\nand gave the place to Rufino de Rivera, who had formerly been auditor\r\nde guerra and asesor de gobierno.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Governor Marquina assumed office, he relieved the\r\nmagistrates of the audiencia of all share in the administration of\r\nthese monopolies, combining all these branches of real hacienda under\r\nthe asesor above mentioned. On August 3, 1791, the audiencia protested\r\nagainst the acts of the governor, basing its claims to a continuance\r\nof authority on the cédula of March 20, 1790, by which the king had\r\nauthorized the oidores to administer all the monopolies except tobacco.\r\n\r\nOn August 16, 1791, Governor Marquina answered the complaint of the\r\naudiencia in a memorial of his own, in which he set forth his position\r\nin summarized form, giving a history of the entire contention,\r\nand defining his position with precision and clarity. [318] He\r\nclaimed that the cédulas which had been issued up to that time had\r\nrecognized the right of the governor to dispose of these asesorías,\r\nwhich did not and never had belonged to the oidores by their own\r\nright. As superintendent of real hacienda, he (the governor) was\r\njudge-conservator of all the asesorías, and by cédula of March 20,\r\n1790, he had been authorized to control them through his asesor. The\r\nlatter official had also been ordered to administer the rent of tobacco\r\ndirectly as the agent of the governor and to supervise the others\r\nin the governor's name. The oidores had been forbidden to hold these\r\npositions, except under exceptional circumstances, which, in Marquina's\r\njudgment, did not exist at this time, [319] since there was present\r\nin the colony a special asesor whose duty it was to supervise these\r\nmonopolies. The audiencia would have to try certain cases on appeal\r\nas a judicial body, and oidores who had already rendered decisions\r\nas judge-conservators could not justly render decisions when the same\r\ncases were appealed. He declared that he had the approval of the king\r\nin his contention, and was therefore confident of his position.\r\n\r\nThe governor's will prevailed, and the magistrates were deprived of\r\nthe commissions which they had formerly held; these were given over\r\nto regular officials of real hacienda. Contentious cases, however,\r\nthat did not pertain exclusively to finance were tried on appeal\r\nin the audiencia and that body exercised regular, but not special,\r\njurisdiction in them thereafter.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important offices which the oidores were called on\r\nto perform was that of juez de difuntos. The duties of this office\r\nconsisted largely in the administration of the funds and property\r\nof persons who died intestate, or without heirs in the colony. This\r\nwork was entrusted to the colonial audiencia as a body in 1526,\r\nand any judge therein might be delegated from the tribunal for the\r\nadjustment of an estate.\r\n\r\nThe first law providing for a special administrator was proclaimed\r\nat Valladolid on April 16, 1550. It stated that many of the heirs of\r\npersons who died in the colonies had been defrauded of their rightful\r\ndues by the carelessness, omission, illegal procedure, and usurpation\r\nof the ministers who had diverted the property to their own uses; this\r\ncondition of affairs made reform imperative. Viceroys and presidents\r\nof royal audiencias, while retaining power of removal for cause,\r\nwere commanded henceforth to name, at the beginning of each year,\r\nan oidor from the local audiencia to act as juez de difuntos. [320]\r\nThis judge was authorized to collect, administer, rent, sell, and\r\nhave general supervision over the property of deceased persons to\r\nthe same extent that the audiencia previously had. The acts of the\r\njudge were appealable to the audiencia of the district wherein he\r\nofficiated. On December 15, 1609, a law was proclaimed by Philip\r\nIII which extended the term of this judge from one to two years. The\r\nearly laws provided no extra salary for the juez de difuntos. It was\r\nprescribed that his decisions should be respected by the audiencia and\r\nby the other officials of the government, the viceroys and presidents\r\nbeing especially instructed not to allow any other official to usurp\r\nhis functions.\r\n\r\nIn case the juez de difuntos should fail to execute his duties,\r\nor should exceed his powers, it was the duty of the fiscal to bring\r\nthe abuse to the attention of the audiencia, and that tribunal was\r\nsupposed to see that the proper methods were enforced. The jurisdiction\r\nof this special magistrate was to extend to the settling of the\r\nestates of intestates, and of testates leaving property to persons in\r\nSpain. His authority was valid over the property of deceased officials,\r\nmerchants, and encomenderos, and it might be extended to the cases\r\nof foreigners. He also assisted in the disposal of property left\r\nby clerics. When the latter died intestate, the proceeds of their\r\nestates were added to the fund known as the bienes de difuntos. No\r\ndistinction was made between property left by them and that left\r\nby civil employees of the government or private citizens. If these\r\npriests had made testaments, it was the duty of the juez de difuntos\r\nto see that the property reached the donees without the interference\r\nof the prelates. [321]\r\n\r\nAs in other cases noted in this and in former chapters, so in the\r\nadministration of the estates left by intestate decedents the laws\r\nseem to have undergone considerable change. In 1526, Charles V ordered\r\nthat such estates were to be administered under the supervision of the\r\naudiencia. In 1550, the place of special juez de difuntos was created\r\nin each audiencia, the post to be filled by a magistrate designated\r\nby the president. In 1653, Philip IV added to the importance of the\r\noffice by decreeing that all intestate cases should be administered by\r\na special juez de difuntos, irrespective as to whether the heirs were\r\nin Spain, or at the place where the death took place. [322] This law\r\nprovided that if children or descendants were left whose legitimacy\r\nwas unquestioned, the heirs being in the colony, or if a will legally\r\nattested and witnessed were left, the case was to be settled in the\r\nordinary courts. If there were doubt, however, as to the validity\r\nof the claims of persons representing themselves as descendants, or\r\nif there were no heirs, the case would then be administered by the\r\njuez de difuntos. Settlements made by the ordinary justices were not\r\nreviewed in the royal audiencia. The authority accorded them frequently\r\nafforded pretexts for their intervention in cases which should have\r\nbeen settled by the juez de difuntos, particularly when heirs were\r\nleft in Spain and in other colonies. A number of disagreements arose\r\nover this point, but all doubt was conclusively settled by the cédula\r\nof January 31, 1772, which awarded such jurisdiction to the juez\r\nde difuntos. [323] This was confirmed by the law of September 28,\r\n1797. Foreigners residing outside the dominions were not allowed to\r\ninherit property left to them in the colonies, even though they were\r\nlineal descendants. [324] Heirs or others claiming property left by\r\ndeceased persons must appear in person, or have others appear for\r\nthem, properly authorized, and must prove conclusively their rights\r\nas heirs or creditors.\r\n\r\nThe cédula of September 28, 1797, was a codification and a\r\nreclassification of all previous laws on the subject of this\r\njurisdiction. The provisions of this law, briefly stated, were as\r\nfollows: (1) These judges should not under any circumstances have\r\njurisdiction over property left by will, or without will, when the\r\nheirs were present and when there was no question of their right to the\r\nproperty. (2) In order that these judges have power of intervention,\r\nit must be well known or appear by judicial process that either all\r\nthe heirs or the greater number of them were absent. (3) They were not\r\nto have jurisdiction over property left by Indians or caciques. (4)\r\nThey should not usually have authority to settle up the estates or\r\nproperty of native clerics, because their heirs would presumably be\r\npresent. These cases were therefore subject to the jurisdiction of\r\nthe ordinary courts, unless it were shown that there were heirs in\r\nSpain. Under no circumstances should the ecclesiastical authorities\r\nhave intervention in these cases. (5) When the heirs were present, the\r\naudiencia was ordered to enforce the law which forbade the intervention\r\nof both the juez de difuntos and the ordinary judge. [325] In these\r\ncases the heirs were allowed to assume their property intact, without\r\nits being sold and thereby costs incurred. (6) The practice which had\r\nhitherto been followed by the juez de difuntos of diverting a fifth of\r\nthe property of those who died intestate for the repose of the souls\r\nof the dead should cease from that time onward, and the proceeds of\r\nsaid property should be handed over without deduction to the heirs and\r\nrelatives of the deceased, in accordance with the cédula of June 20,\r\n1766. [326] (7) The juez de difuntos was forbidden to intervene in\r\nthe settlement of estates or property left to heirs by will. [327]\r\n\r\nIt would appear, then, that the oidor detailed as juez de difuntos\r\nhad jurisdiction over cases of intestacy, over the settlement of\r\nproperty when no heirs were apparent, or when there was doubt as to\r\nthe existence of heirs, and in cases where the designated testamentary\r\ndonees were outside the colony. The ordinary justices administered\r\nestates in two capacities, namely, when testaments were to be executed,\r\nthe heirs being present, or when they acted as agents for the juez\r\nde difuntos. The latter was privileged to call upon the corregidores,\r\nalcaldes mayores, and other ordinary justices to execute provisions in\r\nthe provinces, and these officials were obliged, when so designated,\r\nto settle estates subject to the supervision of the juez. [328]\r\n\r\nWhen the heirs were resident in Spain, or in some colony other than\r\nthe Philippines, the estates of deceased persons were sold and the\r\nmoney was set aside to be remitted to Spain. The collective sum of\r\nthese properties, sold and unsold, was designated as the bienes de\r\ndifuntos. [329] At stated periods the juez de difuntos was required to\r\nturn over the funds that he had collected, or received in the execution\r\nof his duties, to the oficiales reales, first deducting three per\r\ncent of their gross amount for his services. [330] His accounts,\r\nwhich were sent to the Council of the Indies, were also audited by\r\nthese officials, and the audiencia likewise held him accountable for\r\nany abuses or errors other than financial. He was also held responsible\r\nin his residencia. The fiscal was his prosecutor in case of suit. The\r\njuez de difuntos, on his part, was authorized to require reports\r\nfrom the agents and administrators who served him in the provinces,\r\nand all necessary safeguards were taken for his protection. [331]\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the juez de difuntos, acting through the oficiales\r\nreales, sent such money as he had collected to the Casa de Contratación\r\nof Seville, or, after June 18, 1790, the date of the extinction of\r\nthat body, to the juez de arribadas in Cádiz. [332] Thence it was\r\ndistributed among the heirs in various parts of Spain, or, in case\r\nno heirs were found, it was to remain in a fund by itself, until\r\notherwise appropriated or disposed of by the crown. The money was sent\r\nat the risk of the heirs, eighteen per cent of the gross amount being\r\ndeducted to pay the costs of transfer. [333] In actual practice,\r\nhowever, the funds derived from the Philippines were retained at\r\nManila, itemized accounts of them being forwarded to Acapulco, the\r\nproper amount being deducted there from the annual subsidy. [334]\r\nThis rendered unnecessary the actual transfer of money. The juez de\r\ndifuntos in Mexico received the funds from the Philippines, together\r\nwith reports and accounts relating thereto, and remitted them to\r\nSpain. There occurred many instances in which this magistrate in\r\nMexico found mistakes in the reports rendered by his subordinate\r\nin Manila. A great deal of criticism was made from time to time, of\r\nalleged irregularities in the administration of these funds in the\r\nPhilippines; in fact, successive royal cédulas repeatedly charged\r\nthe Philippine officials with maladministration. [335] The general\r\nsuperintendent of finance, Aparici, in a report to the Council,\r\nstated on July 19, 1797, that these funds had never been properly\r\naccounted for, and that glaring defects--even dishonesty, had always\r\nexisted. [336] These faults, he alleged, were owing to the fact that\r\nthe funds were not directly administered, but were paid into the\r\ntreasury of Mexico, and that because of this roundabout method direct\r\ncontrol could not be exercised. Although this high official pointed\r\nout these defects and made recommendations for the betterment of the\r\nservice, no change was made, and the funds continued to be remitted\r\nto Mexico until 1815, when the suspension of the regular galleon\r\neliminated the possibility of this practice. [337]\r\n\r\nThe juez de difuntos was frequently opposed in the exercise of his\r\nspecial jurisdiction by other officials of the colony. Many cases\r\ninvolving these conflicts of jurisdiction were appealed to the Council\r\nof the Indies. Among the most frequent were the quarrels which took\r\nplace between the captain-general and the juez de difuntos over\r\nthe question of the special military jurisdiction of the latter,\r\nand the claim of the juez de difuntos to administer the property\r\nof military and galleon officials. For example, on July 6, 1757,\r\nthe juez appealed to the Council for jurisdiction over the property\r\nof a deceased galleon official on the basis of the rights conceded to\r\nhim by the laws of the Indies; [338] the governor claimed the right to\r\nadminister this property on the ground that the galleon officials were\r\nappointed by him, and that they were held by the laws of the Indies\r\nto be under the military jurisdiction. This case was decided in favor\r\nof the juez de difuntos, and may be considered as having established\r\na precedent for his subsequent jurisdiction over such cases. [339]\r\n\r\nProbably the most notable case of conflict between the civil and\r\nmilitary jurisdictions and one which involved the juez de difuntos\r\noccurred at the time of the death of the lieutenant-governor and king's\r\nlieutenant, Pedro Sarrio. The latter had left his property by will to\r\nhis brother, the Marqués de Algorja, a resident of Alicante. He had\r\nappointed a resident of Manila as executor. The governor claimed that\r\nthe right to administer the property belonged to the executor. The\r\njuez de difuntos, on the ground that Sarrio had left heirs in Spain,\r\ncontended that the funds should be administered by him, as the executor\r\ndid not have authority to transmit the property to Spain. This case\r\nwas carried to the Council of the Indies; no record appears of its\r\nultimate solution, but it is illustrative of the commonly accepted\r\nprinciple that the juez de difuntos should have authority over the\r\nadministration of all property which had to be transmitted to Spain for\r\ndistribution among heirs. [340] The governor's contention against it\r\nwas based on the fact that Sarrio was a military official. As we have\r\nalready seen, the law of August 29, 1798, authorized the settlement\r\nof the property of soldiers by special military courts. [341]\r\n\r\nOther sources of frequent dispute were the respective claims of the\r\njuez de difuntos and the oficiales reales for jurisdiction over\r\nproperty left by persons who were indebted to the royal treasury\r\nat the time of their death. On the occasion of the death of the\r\ncorregidores of Tondo and Ilocos, in 1776 and 1778, respectively,\r\nwithout having made wills, the oficiales reales took steps to make an\r\nimmediate seizure of the property of the deceased officials. They\r\ndemanded that all documents and papers pertaining to the cases\r\nshould be surrendered at once into their hands in order that the\r\namount owing to the government might be collected. Governor Basco y\r\nVargas interposed on the ground that since these officials had died\r\nintestate, the settlement of their property should be effected by\r\nthe juez de difuntos; it being incumbent upon the oficiales reales\r\nto present the claims to the judge. [342]\r\n\r\nShortly after this decision had been rendered, the alcalde mayor of\r\nTayabas died, leaving a deficit of 7000 pesos, and the officials of\r\nthe royal treasury immediately brought suit in the audiencia on the\r\nbasis of the laws of the Indies for jurisdiction in the case prior\r\nto that of the juez de difuntos. They alleged that the law provided\r\nthat the treasury officials should have precedence in collections,\r\nand that debts due to the real hacienda should be settled prior to\r\nall others. Moreover, they claimed that all officials should assist\r\nthem in making these collections and that no restrictions should\r\nbe placed upon their activities. Further evidence in support of the\r\ncontentions of the treasury officials was submitted in the substance\r\nof the royal cédula of April 23, 1770, which declared that these\r\njudges should be entrusted exclusively with the collection of royal\r\nfunds. \"Furthermore,\" the cédula stated, \"if any case shall arise which\r\npertains to finance and at the same time to the juez de difuntos, the\r\nlatter may not make the advocation, because, however favorable may be\r\nhis jurisdiction, that of the royal treasury is more favorable.\" [343]\r\nThe oficiales reales insisted that they should not be required to go\r\nbefore the juez de difuntos for any purpose, since the laws of the\r\nIndies [344] gave them the power of inspecting the accounts of the juez\r\nde difuntos and of keeping and administering these funds. [345] The\r\nmore recent cédula of October 13, 1780, had decreed that the accounts\r\nof the juez de difuntos should be approved by the treasury officials,\r\nand on this basis they were able to advance claims to seniority.\r\n\r\nThis dispute, though brought for adjudication before the audiencia,\r\nwas not settled by the tribunal. The evidence pertaining to the case\r\nwas collected and referred to the Council on December 22, 1786. The\r\ncédula which finally disposed of the matter was issued May 4, 1794,\r\nin the following terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is indisputable that the ministers of our real hacienda are\r\n    authorized to have jurisdiction over all debtors of my royal\r\n    treasury ... with preference to the ordinary jurisdiction of the\r\n    juez de difuntos, or to the judge commissioned to settle property\r\n    of intestates or to pay creditors; ... the accounts of my real\r\n    hacienda shall be settled by my royal judges before the juez de\r\n    difuntos may have cognizance. [346]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this decree it was definitely established that the treasury\r\nofficials should have precedence over the regular judges in the\r\nsettlements of estates of officials and individuals against whom\r\nthe royal treasury had claims. After the demands of the government\r\nwere paid, those of private individuals might be settled, and it was\r\nordered that the juez de difuntos, as the champion of individual\r\nclaims, should always give precedence to the oficiales reales who\r\nrepresented the interests of the government.\r\n\r\nThe organization for the administration of these funds presented a\r\ncomplete hierarchy. The actions of the juez de difuntos were subject\r\nto review by the Audiencia of Manila. The funds from the Philippines\r\nwere deducted from the subsidy at Acapulco, and forwarded to the Casa\r\nde Contratación of Seville (or the juez de arribadas at Cádiz, after\r\n1790) by the juez de difuntos of Mexico. The heirs in Spain were then\r\nfound, and the money transferred to them, less discounts covering costs\r\nof transmission to Spain. In case appeals were made from the decision\r\nor settlement of the juez de difuntos, the records of his proceedings\r\nin the case under consideration were reviewed by the Council of the\r\nIndies. The method of procedure there was to refer these documents and\r\naccounts to the Contaduría General, where all accounts for the Council\r\nwere audited and settled, and the recommendations of that tribunal were\r\naccepted. The constitutional reforms of the nineteenth century gave the\r\naudiencia increased authority in the final settlement of these matters,\r\nand its decision was made final in practically all contentious cases,\r\nthough, of course, final judgments involving heirs who were resident\r\nin Spain might still be appealed by them to the Council of the Indies\r\nor the Supreme Tribunal of Justice.\r\n\r\nAside from the activities of the magistrates as members of the juntas\r\nde hacienda, described earlier in this chapter, it would perhaps be\r\nsafe to assert that the tribunal exercised general supervision over\r\nfinancial affairs in the colony until the time of the establishment\r\nof the intendancy (1785-87). Correspondence between the Council of\r\nthe Indies and the Audiencia of Manila would seem to indicate that the\r\nmagistrates were expected to transmit, and did send, in fact, reports\r\non colonial finances to the Council of the Indies. Among the reports\r\nof the oidores about twenty of these periodical statements have been\r\nfound, covering irregularly the period from 1609 to 1780. No doubt a\r\ncomplete set exists. These generally embody a detailed audit of the\r\naccounts of the oficiales reales. Numerous commissions were also sent\r\nto the audiencia from time to time, ordering the magistrates to give\r\nspecial attention to financial affairs, such as the collection of\r\nlicenses from Chinese; to see that tithes were efficiently collected\r\nand reported, to see that the tax on metals (mined) was paid, and\r\noffering special rewards in case of apprehension. It has already been\r\nshown that the king on August 8, 1609, asked the audiencia whether\r\nthe king's fifth had been commuted to a tenth in the Philippines. On\r\nJuly 21, 1756, the audiencia reported on the number of ships that\r\nhad entered the harbor of Manila during the year before. On May 4,\r\n1760, Francisco Leandro de Viana, the fiscal, charged the merchants\r\nof Manila with wholesale fraud in the payment of the almojarifazgo,\r\npaying only 3% when the law of 1714, then in force, had ordered the\r\npayment of 8%. Viana's report charged the oidores with responsibility\r\nfor this deliberate violation of the law, alleging that the oidores\r\nhad been profiting thereby. It was on this occasion that the fiscal\r\nrecommended the establishment of a consulado at Manila, which would\r\nremove from the magistrates of the audiencia all temptation to use\r\ntheir positions for private profit in violation of the commercial\r\nlaws of the realm. [347] The part played by the magistrates in the\r\nadministration of the trade with Acapulco may also be mentioned\r\nhere. This will be discussed in a subsequent chapter. [348]\r\n\r\nApart from the extra duties and commissions already noted, the\r\naudiencia was utilized for a variety of purposes which are too\r\nmiscellaneous to be classified, but too important to be omitted\r\nfrom this discussion. Duplicates of executive orders relating to\r\nsubjects far removed from the jurisdiction of the audiencia as a\r\ncourt, were sent to it, with instructions that the tribunal take\r\nnote of numerous matters, such as seeing that the laws were properly\r\nexecuted, observing the effect of reforms, and reporting on their\r\navailability and adaptability at various times and places. Copies of\r\nnew laws relating to civil and ecclesiastical affairs were sent to\r\nthe audiencia for its information.\r\n\r\nThe above practices were never more prominently evident than during the\r\nconstitutional reforms from 1810 to 1823. [349] That period, of course,\r\nwas a time of change and stress, and the audiencia seems to have been\r\nregarded as the one stable authority in the Philippines. Cédulas and\r\nexecutive orders were issued to the audiencia without regard to the\r\ndepartment of government to which they applied. By the cédula of June\r\n14, 1811, the audiencia was made responsible for the execution of all\r\nthe orders of the superior government. On March 18, 1812, oaths of\r\nall civil and judicial officials were ordered to be administered by\r\nthe audiencia. A royal order was received by the Audiencia of Manila\r\non January 19, 1813, which forbade the existence of free-masonry in\r\nthe Islands. The audiencia was made responsible for the execution\r\nof all these cédulas and decrees. On August 6, 1813, the tribunal\r\nacknowledged receipt of the law of April 25, 1810, which forbade\r\nforeigners to land in the Islands without passports. The audiencia\r\nwas again made responsible for the execution of the reforms of 1812,\r\n1815, 1823, 1834, and 1835, by which the entire administrative and\r\njudicial systems of the colony were reorganized.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of officials was continually under the observation of\r\nthe oidores, and special reports were frequently sent to the Council\r\nfrom the audiencia in review of the progress of the government in\r\ngeneral, or in elucidation of some special phase of it. [350] A few\r\nmore examples of these investigations which were charged upon the\r\noidores may be reviewed here, together with the reports made by the\r\nmagistrates in compliance with royal instructions.\r\n\r\nThe king, on August 9, 1609, wrote to the audiencia, asking for\r\ninformation concerning the truth of a certain report which had come to\r\nhim regarding a custom practiced among the natives before the arrival\r\nof the Spaniards, and which was said still to be in operation. It\r\nhad been asserted that the children of a free man and a slave woman\r\nwould be half-slave and half-free, and the progeny of these children\r\nby subsequent marriage would be classed as a fourth, an eighth, or\r\na sixteenth slave or free. It was said that the natives recognized\r\nvarying degrees of freedom and slavery. The king, in the letter above\r\nreferred to, expressed a desire to know the truth of these reports,\r\nand he ordered the audiencia to instruct him fully concerning these\r\nalleged practices and customs. He called attention to the existing law\r\nwhich forbade Spaniards to hold slaves, and he requested information\r\nas to how great a hold this barbarous custom had upon the natives,\r\nand how it might be eradicated with the least possible inconvenience\r\nand loss. [351]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was required to submit data regularly concerning the\r\nreligious orders, showing the number of friars belonging to each order\r\nand designating the provinces that were held by each. The tribunal\r\nwas often asked to make recommendations for the regulation of the\r\nreligious. As we shall note in a subsequent chapter, one of the regular\r\nduties of the audiencia was to send in a yearly report on the number of\r\nreligious arriving in or departing from the Islands. The tribunal had\r\njurisdiction over the royal colleges and universities; it exercised\r\nsupervision over courses of study and instruction given in them,\r\nand the oidores reported concerning these matters from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia kept the court informed as to the number of Spaniards\r\nin the Islands, the occupation of each, and his attitude toward the\r\ngovernment. It reported on the number of Chinese and other foreigners\r\nin the Islands, the amount of tribute paid by the Chinese, and\r\nthe extent of the Chinese trade. From time to time the magistrates\r\nwere asked by the court to make special reports on these or other\r\nsubjects. They were required to report from time to time on the number\r\nand services of the officials of the government, major and subordinate,\r\nwhether they were all needed, the quality of their services, and what\r\nreforms could be made to effect greater economy and efficiency. The\r\naudiencia was especially charged with the duty of seeing that the\r\nprovincial officials were not so numerous as to be a burden on the\r\nnatives. The government realized that oppression of the Indians\r\nwould result from the presence of too many Spaniards among them,\r\nand the effort was continually made to limit the number of these\r\nundesirables. The audiencia, in short, was the representative of the\r\nking in all these matters.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions the audiencia assumed the initiative, or\r\nassisted materially, in the accomplishment of various functions of an\r\nextraordinary character. It played an important role in checking the\r\nepidemic of smallpox which ravaged the Islands from 1790 to 1794. On\r\nJanuary 18, 1790, Governor Marquina reported that this disease had been\r\nplaying havoc with the Indians in various parts of the Islands. [352]\r\nHe had raised 2385 pesos by voluntary contributions from different\r\nofficials and corporations, and had appointed a committee to administer\r\nthe funds. This committee consisted of representatives of the different\r\nreligious communities and the consulado, the archbishop, the chief\r\nof the contaduría, the fiscal, the regent and the magistrates of the\r\naudiencia. Soon after this letter was written Marquina's residencia was\r\ntaken, and the king, on January 24, 1794, wrote to the regent, asking\r\nhim to act as executive of the general committee already appointed\r\nto conduct the campaign against this epidemic, and to report what\r\nprogress had been made in combatting it, suggesting that a general\r\ncommittee of sanitation should be constituted to handle such cases\r\nin the future. [353]\r\n\r\nIn the cédula of November 26, 1765, we find another illustration of\r\nthe extraordinary functions of the magistrates of the audiencia. The\r\ngovernor was ordered on this occasion to appoint a committee to\r\nconsider ways and means of remedying the damage done to agriculture and\r\ncommerce in the Islands as a result of the depredations of the English\r\nupon their occupation of various parts of the Islands. This committee\r\nwas to consist of the fiscal as president, the oidores, the chief of\r\nthe contaduría, the alcaldes ordinarios of the city, and the alcaldes\r\nmayores of the districts immediately outside the city. It was ordered\r\nto meet at stated periods to discuss and recommend ways and means of\r\nimprovement, proper taxation, and other measures calculated to bring\r\nabout a revival of agriculture. This committee was the forerunner\r\nof the Sociedad de Amigos del País, which was established during the\r\nadministration of Governor José Basco y Vargas. [354]\r\n\r\nThe variety of the functions of the audiencia is well illustrated by\r\na report made on July 20, 1757, in compliance with a royal order of\r\ninquiry as to how much money should be expended by the Philippine\r\ngovernment on the inauguration ceremonies of the governor. [355]\r\nBesides noting an added duty of the tribunal, this is illustrative\r\nof the pomp and ceremony utilized to impress the inhabitants of the\r\ncolonies with the grandeur of Spain and her government. After a lengthy\r\ninvestigation, the audiencia stated in reply that the government of\r\nPerú had been authorized to spend 12,000 pesos in the reception of\r\na viceroy, while New Spain could spend 8000 pesos. As much as 4000\r\npesos had been spent in Manila in times past. Since the Philippines\r\nwas a colony of less importance than these, and the governor there\r\nwas of inferior rank to the viceroy, and as even these sums were\r\nextravagant, it was the opinion of the tribunal that the government at\r\nManila should limit itself to an expenditure of 2000 pesos. This may\r\nbe considered as an example of the work accomplished by the oidores\r\nin checking the excesses of the other officials and departments of\r\nthe government. [356]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia had general authority over the inspection and censorship\r\nof books which were printed in the colony or imported. This power was\r\nconceded by a series of laws promulgated at different times from 1556\r\nto 1668. [357] At the earlier date it was ordered that no book treating\r\nof the Indies should be printed without first having been inspected,\r\napproved, and licensed by the Council of the Indies, and none could\r\nbe introduced into the Indies without the express permission of that\r\nbody. [358] Books of fables and other profane publications were not\r\nallowed in the colonies under any circumstances. The Council of the\r\nIndies, by enactment of May 8, 1584, authorized the audiencia to\r\npublish books and dictionaries in the native dialects, and a later\r\nlaw stipulated that twenty copies of each book should be sent to the\r\nCouncil of the Indies to be placed on file there. [359] The oidores\r\nand the oficiales reales whose duty it was to inspect the ships\r\nwhich arrived from New Spain were ordered to search for forbidden and\r\nheretical books, but in doing this they must act in conformity with\r\nthe expurgatories of the Inquisition. [360] By cédula of October 10,\r\n1575, and of December 2, 1580, the right to print books of prayer\r\nand of divine service for Spain and the Indies was conceded to the\r\nmonastery of San Lorenzo. This same cédula ordered that viceroys,\r\npresidents, and oidores should see that no other service-books were\r\nused in the churches and monasteries, and that books printed by any\r\nother agency should not be permitted to enter the Islands. [361]\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the above regulations, the Audiencia of Manila,\r\non July 21, 1787, suppressed a book which had been written by the\r\ncommissary of the Inquisition, on the ground that this functionary\r\nhad published it on the authority of the archbishop alone, and without\r\nauthorization of the Council of the Indies, as was required by law. The\r\ncase was appealed by the commissary to the Council, and the latter\r\nbody, while approving the action of the audiencia in suppressing the\r\nbook, and reprimanding the archbishop, after an examination of the\r\nvolume, allowed its publication in conformity with the laws of the\r\nIndies. [362] Taken together, the relations of the audiencia and the\r\ncommissary of the Inquisition in most matters, and particularly in\r\nthe publication of books, were harmonious, and the same strife and\r\ntrouble did not occur in the Philippines that developed in Mexico,\r\nNaples, and Perú over the question. [363]\r\n\r\nOn January 26, 1816, the audiencia forbade the publication of any\r\nbook without its express permission. [364] As a result, considerable\r\ntrouble arose with the governor and the fiscal, neither of whom had\r\nbeen consulted when the auto was passed. The fiscal contended that the\r\naudiencia was violating the law which had reserved to the Council the\r\npower to give licenses for the publication of books; moreover, it was\r\nasserted, the law required the governor and audiencia to act in acuerdo\r\nin matters pertaining to the suppression and licensing of books,\r\nthe tribunal not being authorized to proceed alone. The audiencia\r\ncontended in reply that these laws could no longer be interpreted\r\nto mean that the governor should have authority over matters of a\r\npurely judicial nature, such as these were, because he was no longer\r\npresident of the audiencia, and hence not a judicial official. [365]\r\nThe tribunal furthermore based its contention on two enactments--one,\r\na royal order dated October 1, 1770, which directed certain prelates\r\nto apply to the audiencia for permission to have a religious work\r\npublished, and the other, dated July 21, 1787, already cited, by\r\nwhich the king confirmed the refusal of the audiencia to allow the\r\npublication of a work prepared by the commissary of the Inquisition,\r\nwhen he had failed to seek the authority of the audiencia. It is clear,\r\nhowever, that on this occasion the audiencia was guilty of deliberate\r\nmisinterpretation of the law in its own favor. The Council of the\r\nIndies had the final right to decide as to the contents of the book,\r\nand the audiencia merely suspended publication, pending the action of\r\nthe Council. The audiencia was never given the power to pass finally\r\non the contents of books, except those dealing with languages and\r\ndialects. The ultimate right of passing on all religious publications\r\nwas retained by the Council of the Indies, while the audiencia was\r\nauthorized merely to suspend the publication and circulation of books\r\nwhich had not complied with the above royal ordinances. After the\r\nsuppression of the Council of the Indies and the establishment of\r\nthe Supreme Tribunal of Justice, there was a tendency toward giving\r\nthe colonial governments a wider degree of latitude in such matters.\r\n\r\nIt has been noted already, in the cédula of October 9, 1812, and\r\nin subsequent reforms, that all matters of a contentious nature\r\nshould be settled in the audiencias and not carried to the tribunal\r\nin Spain. A further reform in the censorship of books was made on\r\nOctober 4, 1839, when the control of these matters was placed in the\r\nhands of two censors, appointed by the acuerdo and the archbishop,\r\nrespectively. In case a decision were made to suppress a certain book,\r\na legal proceeding had to be instituted before the fiscal, who became\r\nthe arbiter if a disagreement arose between the censors. Seizure was\r\njustified on the grounds that the publication contained something\r\ncontrary to the legitimate interests of the throne or of the\r\nreligion. Condemned books were not only seized, but sent from the\r\ncolony. [366] The responsibilities of censorship were thus shared\r\nuntil October 7, 1856, when, on account of the many disagreements\r\nwhich had arisen as a result of this divided authority, the superior\r\ngovernment decreed that a standing board of censors should be created,\r\nto consist of eight members, four to be appointed by the archbishop\r\nand four by the governor. This board was to be presided over by the\r\nfiscal of the audiencia. [367]\r\n\r\nAmong other important functions of a non-judicial character was\r\nthe audiencia's duty of keeping the archives of the government. The\r\ntribunal had a number of records in which entries were made concerning\r\nits work. [368] A registry was kept of the votes of the oidores\r\nin suits involving a hundred thousand maravedís or more. Further,\r\nseparate records were kept of all resolutions of the acuerdo relative\r\nto government and finance, respectively, Thursday afternoon of each\r\nweek being devoted to the latter. Likewise, a book of cédulas and royal\r\nprovisions was kept by the audiencia, and on the basis of these the\r\ntribunal formed all judgments and gave advice when requested. Separate\r\nfiles were kept for copies of all royal orders, cédulas and letters,\r\none for secret, and the other for open correspondence. In another\r\nvolume an account was kept of the amounts received from fines and\r\nfrom funds liquidated for the expenses of justice. As already stated,\r\nlists were also maintained of all persons residing in the colony,\r\nwith an account of their quality and work, their attitude toward the\r\ngovernment, their occupation, and, if they were officials, the nature\r\nand character of their services. [369] The audiencia kept a book\r\nof residencias, which has been described in a former chapter. Also\r\nrecords of persons coming to and leaving the Islands, with appropriate\r\nentries concerning them, were preserved in this archive.\r\n\r\nBesides the special duties of the oidores indicated in this chapter,\r\nthere were others which will be described later in more detail. The\r\nresidencia has been already treated. Other duties will be noted in\r\nconnection with the relation of the audiencia and the governor. Some\r\nare more closely related to the religious and the ecclesiastical\r\ninstitutions of the colony, and merit special treatment in that\r\nconnection. The audiencia, moreover, had extensive functions in\r\nrelation to the commercial and economic life of the colony. A fuller\r\ncomprehension of these numerous activities may be gained in the\r\nfollowing chapters where they are discussed in connection with two\r\nof the most powerful factors in the colony's life--the governor and\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE AUDIENCIA AND THE GOVERNOR: GENERAL RELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was brought into closer and more frequent relationship\r\nwith the governor than with any other authority in the colony. The\r\ngovernor was president of the royal audiencia and hence was nominally\r\nits chief magistrate. This brought him into touch with its functions\r\nas a court. The governor was chief executive of the colony, and\r\nin that capacity was responsible for administrative, financial, and\r\nmilitary affairs. It will be noted that the audiencia, in various ways,\r\nexercised powers of intervention in all of these matters.\r\n\r\nThe official title of the governor of the Philippines up to 1861 was\r\ngovernor, captain-general, and president of the royal audiencia. [370]\r\na combination of three important functions. In his capacity as\r\ngovernor, he was chief executive of the civil government, with\r\nauthority over all administrative departments, including finance,\r\nand over ecclesiastical affairs. As captain-general, the governor\r\nwas commander-in-chief of the military forces, with the special duty\r\nof providing for the defense of the Islands. As president of the\r\naudiencia, the governor retained his authority as executive while\r\nentering the field of the judiciary. Though he could not act as\r\njudge, himself, nevertheless we have seen in former chapters that\r\nhe exercised extensive authority over the tribunal, its procedure,\r\nand its magistrates.\r\n\r\nIt will accordingly be our aim in this chapter to discuss the\r\ngeneral relations of the audiencia and the governor. These include\r\nadministrative, financial, and ecclesiastical functions, and those\r\ninvolving the government of the provinces. To these will be added\r\nsuch further observations as remain to be made concerning the judicial\r\nrelations of the governor and audiencia, leaving apart for discussion\r\nin another chapter as an integral subject, the military jurisdiction\r\nand the respective participation of the audiencia and the governor\r\nin the matter of defense.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the governor of the Philippines occupied the same\r\nrelative position, within and without the colony, as did the viceroy in\r\nNew Spain, and during the greater part of the history of the Islands he\r\nwas independent of the government of New Spain and was responsible to\r\nthe Spanish court directly, in the same manner as the viceroy. [371]\r\nThe independence of the Philippine government may be said to have\r\nbeen practically complete, with such exceptions as will be mentioned\r\nin a subsequent chapter, treating of the ad interim rule, after the\r\nre-establishment of the audiencia in 1598. The governor was the chief\r\nadministrative official of the colony, and the provincial governments\r\nderived their authority from him; he was the royal vice-patron,\r\nand in this capacity he bore the same relation to the church in the\r\ncolony as the king did to the church in Spain. Likewise as the king\r\nwas the theoretical head of the state, and was limited and assisted\r\nin the exercise of his authority over the empire by the Council of\r\nthe Indies, so the governor and captain general of the Philippines\r\n(and the viceroy in New Spain and Perú) was the head of the colony,\r\nand was limited by the audiencia. The audiencias of all the colonies\r\nwere equally dependent on the Council of the Indies.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bourne very aptly characterizes the office of governor of\r\nthe Philippines and its relations to the audiencia. He writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Philippine Islands were constituted a kingdom and placed under\r\n    the charge of a governor and captain general, whose powers were\r\n    truly royal and limited only by the check imposed by the Supreme\r\n    Court (the Audiencia) and by the ordeal of the residencia at the\r\n    expiration of his term of office. Among his extensive prerogatives\r\n    was his appointing power which embraced all branches of the civil\r\n    service in the islands. He also was ex officio the President of\r\n    the Audiencia. His salary was $8000 a year, but his income might\r\n    be largely augmented by gifts or bribes. The limitations upon the\r\n    power of the Governor imposed by the Audiencia, in the opinion of\r\n    the French astronomer Le Gentil, were the only safeguard against\r\n    an arbitrary despotism, yet Zúñiga, a generation later pronounced\r\n    its efforts in this direction generally ineffectual. [372]\r\n\r\n\r\nJuan José Delgado, who gives us perhaps the most comprehensive and\r\nrealistic survey of the Philippines of any of the ecclesiastical\r\nhistorians of those Islands, describes the nature of the office of\r\ngovernor as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The governors of these Islands have absolute authority to\r\n    provide and to attend to all that pertains to the royal estate,\r\n    government, war; they have consultations in different matters with\r\n    the oidores of the royal audiencia; they try in the first instance\r\n    the criminal causes of the soldiers, and they appoint alcaldes,\r\n    corregidores, deputy and chief justices of all the Islands for\r\n    the exercise of government, justice, war, ... and besides many\r\n    other preëminences conceded by royal decrees to the presidency\r\n    of the royal audiencia and chancery. [373]\r\n\r\nThe governors of these Islands [he wrote] are almost absolute, and\r\nare like private masters of them. They exercise supreme authority,\r\nby reason of their charge, for receiving and sending embassies to\r\nthe neighboring kings and tyrants, ... they can make peace, make\r\nand declare war, and take vengeance on those who insult us, without\r\nawaiting any resolution from the Court for it. Therefore many kings\r\nhave rendered vassalage and paid tribute to the governors, have\r\nrecognized them as their superiors, have respected and feared their\r\narms, have solicited their friendship, and have tried to procure\r\nfriendly relations and commerce with them; and those who have broken\r\ntheir word with them have been punished. [374]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe governor of the Philippines, like the viceroy of New Spain,\r\nwas the administrative head of the colony, and as such exercised\r\nsupervision over all the departments of the government, likewise\r\nover ecclesiastical affairs. He was directed to devote himself to\r\nthe service of God, and to labor for the welfare of the souls of the\r\nnatives and inhabitants of the provinces, governing them in peace\r\nand quietude, endeavoring to bring about their spiritual and moral\r\nuplift and their numerical increase. The governors (or viceroys)\r\nwere instructed by the laws of the Indies\r\n\r\n\r\n    to provide all things which are convenient for the administration\r\n    and execution of justice, ... to maintain the government and\r\n    defense of their districts, exercising very special care for the\r\n    good treatment, conservation and augmentation of the Indians,\r\n    and especially the collection, administration, account and care\r\n    of the royal exchequer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were instructed, in short, to do all for the provinces under\r\ntheir charge [375] that the king, himself, might do. The laws of the\r\nIndies ordered the audiencia, the religious authorities and the civil\r\nofficials to acknowledge the governor [or viceroy] as their chief. The\r\nlaws emphasized as the special duties of the governor the supervision\r\nand augmentation of the finances, the defense of the colony, and\r\ngeneral supervision over all officials, executive and judicial,\r\ncentral and provincial.\r\n\r\nForemost among the responsibilities of the executive was that of\r\nsupervising the administration of the colonial exchequer. In this,\r\nhowever, he was assisted by the audiencia. The customary oficiales\r\nreales were among the first officials created for the Philippine\r\ngovernment, and they were responsible to the governor. At the time of\r\nthe creation of the audiencia, it was ordered that the governor and\r\ntwo oidores should audit the accounts of the oficiales reales, but\r\nthis power was transferred to Governor Dasmariñas when the audiencia\r\nwas removed in 1589. In 1602 the right of inspection of accounts was\r\nreturned to the oidores, [376] but the governor, it was stated, as\r\nexecutive head of the government, was responsible, and he exercised\r\ndirect intervention in these matters, limited only by the annual\r\ninspection of the oidores. During the greater part of the history of\r\nthe Islands the governor exercised supervision over the collection and\r\nthe administration of the public revenue, in accordance with the law,\r\n[377] and he was required to be present at the weekly meetings of the\r\njunta de hacienda, of which two magistrates were members, there to\r\npass on all financial measures and to authorize expenditures. [378]\r\nThe governor had control over the sale of offices, jointly with the\r\noficiales reales, but from the correspondence on these subjects it\r\nis clear that the audiencia was designed to check the governor's\r\nauthority in that particular. [379] The governor was forbidden to\r\nauthorize extraordinary expenditures from the treasury without express\r\nroyal permission, except in cases of riot, or invasion. [380] This\r\nregulation was almost impossible of faithful execution, and as his\r\nduties increased and became more complicated, the governor was unable\r\nto give as complete attention to these matters as the laws of the\r\nIndies prescribed. Although the governor had these financial powers,\r\nhe could not decide cases appealed from the oficiales reales. These\r\nwere regarded as contentious cases and as such were resolved by\r\nthe audiencia. [381] In Mexico and Lima, wherein there were higher\r\ntribunals of accounts than in Manila (contaduría mayor), the audiencia\r\ndid not have this jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nFrom 1784 to 1787 the governor was temporarily deprived of the\r\nleadership in financial matters by virtue of the Ordinance of\r\nIntendants, but the oidores retained membership in the colonial board\r\nof audits, together with the intendant, who had taken the governor's\r\nformer place as the responsible head of the colony's finances. In 1787\r\nthe governor was restored to his former position with respect to the\r\nexchequer, with the official title of superintendente subdelegado de\r\nreal hacienda. It is sufficient to say that the governor's relation\r\nto this new department did not materially lessen the authority of\r\nthe audiencia with regard to the finances of the colony.\r\n\r\nAlthough the appointing power was claimed by many governors as their\r\nsole prerogative, the audiencia imposed a very decided check on\r\ntheir exercise of this authority. The governor had the right to make\r\nappointments in all departments of the government, except in certain\r\nso-called offices of royal designation, to which the governor made\r\ntentative appointments, subject to subsequent royal confirmation. [382]\r\nAlthough the law of February 8, 1610, exempted appointments made by the\r\ngovernor of the Philippines from the necessity of royal confirmation,\r\n[383] in practice these nominations were sent to the court for approval\r\nin the same manner as were those from Spain's other colonies.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia intervened in the matter of appointments in two ways. In\r\ncase it succeeded to the government on the death of the governor\r\nthe tribunal exercised all the prerogatives of appointment. [384]\r\nWhen the governor was present he was obliged to refer the names\r\nof all candidates to the acuerdo. [385] This was made necessary\r\nbecause the governor, being new to the Islands and unfamiliar\r\nwith local conditions, was not so well fitted to pass upon the\r\nmerits of candidates for office as were the oidores who had become\r\npermanently identified with the interests of the colony and whose\r\nopinion was of weight in these matters. Thus it came about that\r\nthe audiencia exercised joint authority with the governor in making\r\nappointments. [386] The question of the relative authority of the\r\naudiencia and governor in making appointments was a source of conflict\r\nthroughout the history of the Islands.\r\n\r\nWhen the governor submitted the name of a candidate to the acuerdo it\r\nwas the duty of the magistrates to furnish all the information possible\r\nregarding the character, fitness, and ability of the person under\r\nconsideration for the position. If the audiencia and the governor\r\nshould disagree and the latter still persisted in an appointment,\r\nit was the duty of the audiencia to submit, forwarding all evidence\r\nrelative to the candidate to the Council of the Indies, the latter body\r\nultimately taking such action as it deemed best. When the nominations\r\nof the governor reached the Council of the Indies for confirmation,\r\nthat tribunal relied extensively upon information furnished by the\r\naudiencia concerning the candidates under consideration.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the king retained the right to appoint certain\r\nso-called \"officials of royal designation.\" These varied at different\r\ntimes, but, in general, included corregidores, alcaldes mayores,\r\noficiales reales, oidores, regents, and, of course, viceroys,\r\ngovernors, and captains-general. [387] All these officials,\r\nexcept those last named, could be temporarily designated by the\r\nexecutive. Although the law placed corregidores, alcaldes mayores,\r\nand oficiales reales in this category, their designation by the court,\r\nlike the confirmation of encomiendas, was usually nominal. Many of\r\nthese offices were filled in Spain and Mexico, while some appointees\r\nwere named from the Philippines, and probably in the majority of the\r\nlatter cases the royal appointment merely amounted to a confirmation of\r\na temporary appointment made by the governor. The post of governor of\r\nthe Philippines was filled temporarily by the viceroy of New Spain\r\nuntil about 1720. In the same manner the governor of Ternate was\r\nnamed by the Philippine executive, with the advice and consent of\r\nthe audiencia. These ad interim appointments were valid until the\r\nking made them regular by confirmation, or sent persons from Spain\r\nto hold them permanently.\r\n\r\nWhen a vacancy occurred among the offices of royal designation,\r\nit was the governor's duty to forward a list of candidates, or\r\nnominees, and from this list the king, or the Council of the Indies\r\nin his name, made a permanent appointment. [388] In the meantime\r\na temporary appointment was often made by the governor, in acuerdo\r\nwith the audiencia, and the name of the appointee was placed first\r\non the list remitted to the court. This procedure was followed in\r\nthe appointment of encomenderos, corregidores, alcaldes mayores, and\r\ntreasury officials. It was seldom done in the cases of oidores and\r\nfiscales, who, because of their special or professional character,\r\nwere usually sent directly from Spain or from New Spain. Unless there\r\nwere special reasons to the contrary, for instance, the filing of an\r\nadverse report by the audiencia, or a protest on the part of residents,\r\nthe governor's temporary appointments were usually confirmed and\r\nmade permanent. Temporary appointees with salaries exceeding 1000\r\npesos a year only received half-salary until their appointments were\r\nconfirmed. [389] At least two years and frequently four transpired\r\nbefore the regular appointment arrived, and as the terms were from\r\nthree to five years for the majority of these offices, the governor's\r\ncandidate was usually the incumbent a considerable portion of the time,\r\nwhether his nomination were confirmed or not. Neither relatives nor\r\ndependents of governors or oidores could be legally appointed to any\r\noffice. [390] This mandate was often violated, as we shall see. It\r\nwas the duty of the regent and the fiscal to certify to the court\r\nthat appointees were not relatives of the governor or oidores. [391]\r\n\r\nIn an instruction directed exclusively to the Philippine audiencia,\r\nthe king ordered the tribunal to see that offices were bestowed only\r\nupon persons \"who by fitness or qualifications are best able to hold\r\nthem.\" [392] It appears that this law, or another promulgated about\r\nthe same time, gave to the fiscal and the oidores the right to pass on\r\nthe qualifications of encomenderos, alcaldes mayores, corregidores,\r\nand other minor officials, on condition that preference should be\r\ngiven to conquerors, settlers, and their descendants. Governor Alonso\r\nFajardo remonstrated that this new practice hampered the work of the\r\ngovernor, and created difficulties between him and the oidores. [393]\r\nA yet later law, dated October 1, 1624, gave the governor (and viceroy)\r\nthe right to make temporary appointments of all judicial officials,\r\nwithout the interposition of the audiencia. [394] On February 22,\r\n1680, the power of making permanent appointments of alcaldes mayores\r\nand corregidores was vested in the governor and the audiencia. [395]\r\nIn view of this law, the Audiencia of Manila claimed and actually\r\nexercised authority in the appointment of provincial officials from\r\nthat time onward.\r\n\r\nVacancies in the audiencia itself were filled temporarily by the\r\ngovernor. In case the audiencia were governing ad interim it could\r\ndesignate magistrates from the outside to try cases, but the power\r\nof the audiencia, as provided by these laws, was secondary to that of\r\nthe governor if he were present. Under no circumstances were permanent\r\nappointments to the audiencia to be made by any authority other than\r\nthe king and Council. In case there were a vacancy in the office\r\nof fiscal the junior oidor was authorized to fill the place. [396]\r\nConversely, it also occurred that when an extra oidor was needed,\r\nthe fiscal might be temporarily designated to fill the place. [397]\r\nIt was also ordered that if the fiscal could not be spared from his\r\noffice on account of his numerous and important duties, a lawyer\r\nmight be named to act as fiscal ad interim. [398] In New Spain\r\nan alcalde del crimen took the place of the junior oidor when the\r\nlatter occupied the fiscalía. There were no alcaldes del crimen in\r\nthe Philippines, but the cédula of February 8, 1610, above cited,\r\nwas always quoted as furnishing justification for the appointment\r\nof oidores ad interim by the governor. [399] In a subsequent chapter\r\nwe shall refer to several occasions on which this was done; indeed,\r\nentire audiencias were re-constituted by certain governors.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was required to see that the appointees designated\r\nby the governor duly complied with the requirements of residencia;\r\nlikewise that they were properly installed in office, and that they\r\ndid not serve in offices for which they had neither authority nor\r\nqualifications. [400] Notwithstanding the variety and the conflicting\r\ncharacter of the laws bearing on matters of appointment, a careful\r\nconsideration of law and practice leads to the conclusion that the\r\ngovernor, as chief executive, had the power of making appointments,\r\nbut in the execution of this duty he was ordered to consult the\r\naudiencia, although, strictly speaking, he was not obliged to follow\r\nits advice. If there were good reasons for not appointing an official\r\nrecommended by the governor, the oidores could send representations\r\nto the Council of the Indies, setting forth their objections, and the\r\nCouncil might confirm or nullify the appointment, as it chose. The\r\naudiencia could make appointments if it were in temporary charge of\r\nthe government. The authority which the audiencia exercised in regard\r\nto appointments varied according to circumstances. If the governor\r\nwere new at his post, weak or indulgent, the audiencia exercised more\r\nextensive authority than was conceded by the laws. If the governor were\r\nexperienced, efficient, and a man of strong personality and dominating\r\ncharacter, the tribunal exercised less power in regard to appointments,\r\nand, in fact, in all other matters pertaining to government.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the appointing power was the duty which the governor\r\nhad of submitting annually to the court a list of all the officials\r\nof the colony, with comments on the character of their services, and\r\nwith recommendations for promotion or dismissal from office. [401] The\r\noidores were included in these reports. [402] It was also the function\r\nof the governor to report on the administration of justice. [403]\r\nThe governor was instructed to inform the court in case the oidores\r\nengaged in forbidden commercial ventures, either directly, through\r\nthe agency of their wives, or through other intermediaries. [404] He\r\nwas authorized, moreover, to investigate and report on the public and\r\nprivate conduct of the magistrates and of their wives as well [405]\r\nand to exert himself to see that their actions were at all times in\r\nconsonance with the dignity of their rank and positions and of such a\r\ncharacter as would reflect credit on the royal name and entitle them to\r\nthe respect of the residents of the colony. The confidential reports\r\nof the governor to the king might include all of these matters, and\r\nmany others too numerous to mention. On the other hand, the audiencia,\r\nas a body, was authorized to direct the attention of the Council to\r\nany irregularities of which the governor might be guilty, and thus\r\na system of checks and balances was maintained. [406] However, the\r\noidores were forbidden to make charges individually. This injunction\r\nwas so frequently disregarded that it was practically a dead-letter.\r\n\r\nTypical of the governor's authority over all the officials of the\r\ncolony, and incidentally over the oidores, was his power to grant\r\nor withhold permission to marry within the colony. The earlier laws\r\non this subject absolutely forbade viceroys, presidents, oidores,\r\nalcaldes, or their children to marry within their districts. [407]\r\nDeprivation of office and forfeiture of salary were the penalties\r\nfor infraction of these regulations. These laws were followed by\r\nothers which required the president (viceroy or governor) to report\r\nimmediately to the Council the case of any magistrate guilty of\r\nviolating the law forbidding the marriage of officials. [408] It\r\nwas not until 1754 that a law was promulgated providing for special\r\nmarriage dispensations to be granted by the Council of the Indies upon\r\nthe recommendation of the president of the audiencia. [409] In 1789\r\nthe president was authorized to concede permission to accountants\r\nand treasury officials, but not to oidores. [410] The prohibition\r\nwas applied to magistrates until 1843, and the only condition under\r\nwhich they were permitted to marry within the colony was by virtue\r\nof the express permission of the supreme tribunal in Spain. In 1848,\r\nthe president of the audiencia was authorized to grant marriage\r\nlicenses to magistrates on condition that the contracting parties\r\nwere \"of equal quality, customs, and of corresponding circumstances,\"\r\npermission having first been obtained from Spain, [411] the president\r\nalone passing upon the requisite qualifications.\r\n\r\nThe chief reason for the restrictions and prohibitions placed\r\non the marriage of magistrates seems to have been the conviction\r\nthat officers of justice would compromise themselves by marriage,\r\nacquiring vast numbers of relatives and dependents, thereby making\r\nit impossible to render impartial decisions or administer justice as\r\nevenly and dispassionately as they would were they not so familiarly\r\nknown in their districts. It was also necessary to prevent officials\r\nfrom lowering their dignity by union with natives and half-castes. The\r\nmarriage of officials with natives of the Philippines was not regarded\r\nwith favor at any time by the Spanish government.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the above prohibition did not apply with the same force\r\nto fiscales as to magistrates. This is illustrated by a case which\r\narose in 1804 when Fiscal Miguel Díaz de Rivera was deprived of his\r\noffice by royal decree for having married without the permission of\r\nthe Council of the Indies. [412] The fiscal had married the daughter\r\nof the corregidor of Pangasinán, who was a colonel in the Spanish\r\narmy. The mother of the girl was a Eurasian from Madras, and had\r\nbeen a subject of Great Britain. Under the date of May 27, 1805,\r\nDíaz sent a petition to the king, bearing the endorsement of Governor\r\nAguilar, demanding his restoration to office. Among the reasons cited\r\nfor the proposed reinstatement of the fiscal, it was said that Díaz,\r\nbeing a prosecutor and not a magistrate, was not subject to the same\r\nregulations and conditions as the oidores, whose judicial duties\r\nrendered impossible their marriage within the Islands. Aguilar stated\r\nthat the purpose of the law had been to debar ministers from making\r\nsuch marriage connections as would diminish the respect which the\r\ncommunity should have for them as oidores of a royal audiencia, thus\r\nundermining their standing as magistrates. In this instance there\r\ncould have been no case of degradation because of the high standing\r\nof the mother and father. Moreover, a fiscal could not be regarded\r\nas a magistrate, and the same laws did not apply to both classes of\r\nofficials. As an outcome of these representations Díaz was restored\r\nto office by the royal decree of October 13, 1806. [413]\r\n\r\nA duty similar to that just noted, inasmuch as it was indicative\r\nof the authority of the governor over the oidores, was his power\r\nto examine and try criminal charges against the magistrates. A law\r\nwhich was in force from 1550 to 1620 ordered that the president\r\nshould be assisted in the trial of criminal charges against oidores\r\nby alcaldes ordinarios. On September 5, 1620, this law was modified\r\nby the enactment of another, which ordered that in cases involving\r\nimprisonment, heavy fines, removal from office, or the death penalty,\r\nthe governor should make the investigation and refer the autos to\r\nthe Council of the Indies for final judgment.\r\n\r\nThis law still left the trial of oidores for misdemeanors in the\r\ngovernor's jurisdiction, but in cases of sedition or notorious offenses\r\nwhich required immediate action in order to furnish a public example\r\nfor its effect on the natives, the president was required to confer\r\nwith the audiencia, and to act in accordance with its judgment. By\r\nthis law the president was forbidden to make more than temporary\r\nsuspensions of oidores from their offices. In no case could they be\r\npermanent unless first approved by the Council of the Indies. [414]\r\nNotwithstanding this law, it may be noted that certain governors\r\nwent so far on some occasions as to remove, imprison, and exile\r\nmagistrates and to appoint a new audiencia. [415] The judicial power\r\nof the governor over such cases was further altered by the Royal\r\nInstruction of Regents of June 26, 1776, by which he was forbidden\r\nto impose any penalty on the oidores without the concurrence of the\r\nacuerdo and the regent. [416] The president and the acuerdo could\r\nrebuke and discipline oidores, privately, when their conduct demanded\r\nit. Even on such an occasion as this the magistrate was to be given\r\nfull opportunity to defend himself. If a private investigation of\r\nthe conduct of an oidor were necessary, the inquiry could be still\r\nconducted by the senior magistrate. [417] Oidores, on the other hand,\r\nhad no jurisdiction over the trial of charges against the president,\r\nunless it were in his residencia. In this event the investigation\r\nmight be conducted by a magistrate designated by the governor or by\r\nthe Council of the Indies. [418]\r\n\r\nAside from his executive and military duties, the governor was\r\npresident of the royal audiencia. This arrangement had the advantage\r\nof giving him an opportunity to know and appreciate the legal needs\r\nof the colony. It brought him in constant contact with judicial minds,\r\nand his position in this regard was no doubt calculated to keep him in\r\nthe straight and narrow path of the law. Nevertheless, the governor,\r\nwho was usually a soldier, but seldom a lawyer, did not participate\r\nas a magistrate in the trial of cases, and his activities in the\r\ntribunal were directive, rather than judicial. His opinions in all\r\nlegal and administrative matters were prepared by his asesor. [419]\r\n\r\nAs president of the audiencia the governor exercised two important\r\npowers. One authorized him to divide the audiencia into salas and to\r\ndesignate oidores to try cases within the tribunal, to inspect the\r\nprovinces, to take residencias, or to attend to semi-administrative\r\nmatters, such as have been noted in the preceding chapter. [420]\r\nThe other was the power to decide whether a contention was of\r\njudicial, governmental, military, or ecclesiastical character, and\r\nto assign it to the proper department or tribunal. [421] This power\r\nwas significant because it made the governor the supreme arbiter\r\nbetween all conflicting authorities in the colony. Frequently he\r\ndecided disputes between the audiencia and the ecclesiastical courts,\r\nbetween the audiencia and the consulado, or between the oidores and\r\nthe oficiales reales in matters relative to the jurisdiction of these\r\ntribunals over questions at issue.\r\n\r\nWhile the magistrates were allowed to proceed practically without\r\ninterference in affairs of justice, the governor was instructed to keep\r\nhimself informed concerning the judicial work of the audiencia. [422]\r\nWhile forbidden to alter the judgments of the tribunal or to tamper\r\nwith its sentences, [423] he could excuse or remit fines with the\r\nconsent of the oidores. The governor could commute sentences in\r\ncriminal cases. The final pardoning power rested with the king and it\r\nwas exercised upon the recommendation of the governor or the prelates\r\n[424] and the Council of the Indies. There were exceptional occasions,\r\nhowever, on which the governor assumed the responsibility of pardoning\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\nAfter the creation of the office of regent in the audiencias of\r\nthe colonies, in 1776, the governor's position as president of the\r\naudiencia became purely nominal, the regent actually officiating as\r\nchief justice, though the president was still legally required to\r\naffix his signature to all judicial decisions of the tribunal. The\r\nfrequent and extended absences of the governor from the capital and the\r\nmultiplicity of his administrative duties prevented him from attending\r\nto these matters with requisite promptness, and injustice consequently\r\nresulted from the requirement. Many complaints were made from 1776\r\nonward against this condition of affairs, with the result that a\r\nmodification in the existing law was made on October 24, 1803, making\r\nvalid the signature of the regent to all decisions of the audiencia,\r\nwhen the governor was absent from the colony on expeditions of conquest\r\nor tours of inspection. [425] At all other times the governor, as\r\npresident, affixed his signature to all legal acts and autos, although\r\nhe did not participate in their decisions. The law remained thus\r\nuntil 1861, when the governorship was separated from the presidency,\r\nthe acuerdo was abolished, and the regent was made president of the\r\naudiencia with authority to sign all judicial decisions. [426]\r\n\r\nWe have already noted that the governor exercised special judicial\r\npowers, independent of the audiencia. Among these the military\r\njurisdiction stands pre-eminent, and it will be discussed separately in\r\nthe following chapter. The governor was also empowered to try Indians\r\nin first instance, with appeal to the audiencia. [427] The actual\r\ntrial of these cases, however, was delegated to the alcaldes mayores\r\nand corregidores with appeal to the audiencia. It was impossible\r\nfor the governor, occupied as he was with the multitudinous affairs\r\nof his office, to concern himself personally with the thousands of\r\npetty cases among the Indians, or between Indians and Spaniards. He\r\nhad jurisdiction over suits involving the condemnation of property\r\nthrough which public roads were to pass. [428] The special jurisdiction\r\nof the governor, assisted by the audiencia, over cases affecting the\r\nroyal ecclesiastical patronage will be discussed later.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Indies would seem to indicate that both the\r\ngovernor and the audiencia exercised independently the power to\r\nexile undesirable residents from the colony. It was stipulated that\r\nif sentence of exile were passed by the governor and the offenders\r\nwere sent to Spain, the necessary papers, issued by the governor,\r\nshould accompany them. [429] If the decree of banishment were imposed\r\nby the audiencia in its judicial capacity, the governor was forbidden\r\nto commute the sentence or otherwise interfere in the matter. [430] The\r\naudiencia frequently sentenced criminals or other undesirables to spend\r\nterms of varying lengths in the provinces or in the Marianas. This,\r\nas we have seen, was commonly one of the trials connected with the\r\nresidencia. We have a noteworthy illustration of the action of the\r\naudiencia in acuerdo with the governor in the banishment of Archbishop\r\nFelipe Pardo, who was exiled by the acuerdo of the audiencia and\r\nGovernor Juan de Vargas Hurtado, in 1684. Vargas was succeeded the\r\nsame year by Governor Curuzaelegui, who recalled the prelate from\r\nexile and forced the audiencia to endorse the act of recall.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the governor's jurisdiction over banishment\r\nwas his jurisdiction over cases of persons entering the Islands or\r\ndeparting from them without royal permission. [431] He exercised\r\nfinal jurisdiction here over civil and ecclesiastical authorities,\r\nencomenderos, and private persons. The law forbade any person to enter\r\nor leave the Islands without the royal permission, and the governor\r\nwas charged with the execution of this law. Encomenderos were not to\r\nleave the Islands on pain of confiscation of their encomiendas. [432]\r\nWhile the laws of May 25, 1596, and of June 4, 1620, gave authority\r\nto the governor over the religious, relative to their entrance into\r\nthe Islands and departure therefrom, [433] the cédula of July 12,\r\n1640, authorized the audiencia to enforce the law on this subject;\r\nespecially was the tribunal to see that no ecclesiastics departed for\r\nJapan and China without the proper authority. [434] Although there\r\ncan be no doubt of the finality of the governor's jurisdiction in\r\nthis matter, yet the audiencia exercised an advisory power, and an\r\nauthority to check irregularities, particularly with a view to seeing\r\nthat the governor did his duty and fulfilled his obligations in the\r\nmatter. Numerous instances exist to show that whenever this subject was\r\ntreated in a royal order or decree, copies of the law were sent to the\r\naudiencia for its information. On other occasions when there was reason\r\nto believe that there had been irregularities in the procedure of a\r\ngovernor, the audiencia complained to the Council of the Indies. This\r\nwas done for example in 1779 when Governor Sarrio conceded permission\r\nfor several priests to go to Mexico. This action the audiencia claimed\r\nto be irregular, since the Council of the Indies had not been notified\r\nor consulted. The king, on March 6, 1781, approved the action of the\r\ngovernor on the basis of the laws above referred to. [435]\r\n\r\nBesides his judicial authority the governor shared legislative\r\nfunctions with the audiencia. We have noted in an earlier chapter\r\nthat the acuerdo passed ordinances for the domestic welfare and local\r\ngovernment of the colony. It prescribed rules and issued regulations\r\nfor merchants, encomenderos, and religious, in accordance with the\r\nrulings for royal ecclesiastical patronage. The acuerdo developed\r\nfrom the advisory power of the audiencia. The king in his first\r\ndecrees ordered the viceroys and presidents to consult with the\r\noidores whenever the interests of the government demanded it, [436]\r\nand if necessary the opinions of the magistrates could be required\r\nin writing. When an agreement was reached upon a given subject, they\r\nvoted in acuerdo and gradually that acuerdo came to have the force\r\nof law. On many occasions the acuerdo prevailed over the governor's\r\nwill. There was no constitutional basis for this, and the acuerdo,\r\nwhen it became a legislative function in passing ordinances and\r\noverruling the governor himself, assumed prerogatives which were\r\nnever exercised by the audiencias of Spain. [437]\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Indies established the governor as the sole executive,\r\nand forbade the audiencia to interfere with the government. [438]\r\nThe governor, occupied by his extensive administrative and military\r\nduties, came to devote less attention to the judicial side of his\r\noffice, which was left almost entirely to the audiencia. So it\r\ndeveloped that the acuerdos in reference to judicial matters--the\r\nestablishment of tariffs and rules for their observance and the\r\ndispatch of pesquisidores and visitors to the provinces, came in the\r\nlatter eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to be increasingly\r\nthe concern of the audiencia. The authority of the tribunal in these\r\nmatters was recognized by the Constitution of 1812 and the reforms\r\nmade in pursuance thereof. [439]\r\n\r\nIn the same manner the acuerdo came to be recognized in governmental\r\nand administrative matters. The enactments of these legislative\r\nsessions of the audiencia were known as autos acordados. They\r\nultimately came to embrace a wide field. The audiencia passed laws for\r\nthe regulation of the provinces; it made rulings which the alcaldes\r\nmayores and corregidores were to follow in the collection of tribute;\r\nit prescribed their relations with the parish priests; it issued\r\nregulations for the conduct of the friars and the ordinary clergy\r\nrelative to the royal patronage. Laws were passed for the encouragement\r\nof agriculture and industry and the regulation of commerce. Rice,\r\ntobacco and silk culture, the production of cinnamon and cocoanuts,\r\nthe breeding of fowls, the regulation of cock-fighting, cloth-making\r\nand ship-building all came in for their share of attention in the\r\nacuerdo. [440]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia, in the exercise of the acuerdo power, passed ordinances\r\nfor the enforcement of the laws forbidding the unauthorized departure\r\nof persons from the Islands; it helped to fix the rate of passage\r\non the galleons and on the coast-wise ships. It made regulations for\r\nthe Chinese in the Parián, it prescribed the conditions under which\r\nlicenses might be issued to Chinese merchants and it passed ordinances\r\nfor the better enforcement of the laws prohibiting the immigration\r\nof the Chinese. The acuerdo concerned itself with the maintenance\r\nof prisons and the care of prisoners, the residencias of provincial\r\nofficials, the auditing of accounts, the collection of the revenue,\r\nand the supervision of the officials of the treasury. Ordinances\r\nwere passed enforcing the general law which ordered that the natives\r\nshould not live together in Christian communities without marriage,\r\nthat they should attend religious ceremonies, that they should\r\nbe instructed in religion, and that they should not be exploited,\r\neither by the civil or ecclesiastical authorities. It is, of course,\r\nunderstood that the audiencia in no way trespassed the authority\r\nof the church in issuing these regulations; indeed it was quite the\r\ncontrary; these ordinances were passed on the basis of the authority\r\nof the royal patronage, with the design of assisting the vice-patron\r\n(the governor) in the execution of his duties, and the church was\r\naided rather than impeded thereby. It must be remembered, of course,\r\nthat the governor, as president of the audiencia, presided in these\r\nacuerdos, and that in most cases, actually, as well as in theory,\r\nthese autos acordados were his will.\r\n\r\nThere were many occasions in the history of the Islands when\r\nthe acuerdo was influential in the formulation of far-reaching\r\nreforms. The well-known \"Ordinances of Good Government,\" issued\r\nby Governor Corcuera in 1642 for the observance of the provincial\r\nofficials, and repromulgated with modifications by Cruzat y Góngora\r\nin 1696 and by Raón in 1768 were formulated by the acuerdo. [441]\r\nSimilarly were those formulated that were proposed by Marquina in\r\n1790. The local regulations for the consulado, established in 1769,\r\nwere formulated by the audiencia largely on the recommendations\r\nof the able fiscal, Francisco Leandro de Viana. In the same manner\r\nthe new plan of constitutional government given to the Philippines\r\nin 1812 was drafted by the audiencia at the request of the Council\r\nof the Indies. [442] Likewise the plans for the government of the\r\nintendancy were submitted to the acuerdo by Governor Basco y Vargas\r\nin 1785. Indeed, these, as well as the scheme of 1787-8, were actually\r\nwritten by two magistrates of the audiencia, the former plan by Oidor\r\nCiriaco Gonzales Carvajal, subsequently intendant, and the latter by\r\nOidor Castillo y Negrete. [443]\r\n\r\nThere were occasions when the audiencia enacted administrative\r\nmeasures in which the governor failed to participate. These were\r\nespecially noticeable during the administrations of Acuña, Fajardo, and\r\nCorcuera--governors who spent much of their time away from Manila. A\r\nmore recent instance of this occurred in 1790 when the natives of\r\nthe province of Ilocos revolted against a tyrannical and dissolute\r\nalcalde mayor. The acuerdo, notwithstanding the objection of Governor\r\nMarquina, removed the offending official and appointed another, and\r\nthis action was subsequently approved by the king. [444] According\r\nto the laws of the Indies the authority of removal and appointment\r\nof such officials rested with the governor. [445] The tendency of the\r\nacuerdo to act in civil affairs without the advice or presence of the\r\ngovernor was checked by the royal order of November 12, 1840, wherein\r\nthe audiencia was ordered not to attempt to carry its acuerdos into\r\nexecution without the authority of the superior government. [446]\r\nThe evil effects of the audiencia's intervention in provincial\r\ngovernment were pointed out in 1842 by Sinibaldo de Mas, when he wrote:\r\n\"the government of the provinces is in charge of an alcalde-mayor,\r\nwho is at once judge of first instance, chief of political matters,\r\nsubdelegate of the treasury, and war-captain or military commandant,\r\nfor whose different attributes he is subject to authorities distinct\r\nfrom one another.\" [447]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was deprived of its acuerdo power in governmental\r\nmatters by the Constitution of 1812, but it was still retained in\r\njudicial affairs. In 1815 and again in 1823 on the restoration of\r\nthe monarchy, the full acuerdo power as practiced before 1812 was\r\nresumed by the audiencia. Official recognition of the acuerdo was\r\nmade publicly by Governor Torres, who succeeded Enrile on March 18,\r\n1834. In his inaugural address this governor avowed his purpose to be\r\nthe extension and improvement of commerce, the army and agriculture,\r\n\"but, in order to develop these to their highest extent, and to\r\nrealize the utmost success in my administration,\" he said, \"I count\r\non the co-operation of all the authorities, and particularly of\r\nthe real acuerdo, of which I have the honor to be president.\" [448]\r\nThe audiencia was finally excluded from the acuerdo in administrative\r\nmatters by the reform of July 4, 1861; since then the tribunal has been\r\npurely judicial, the legislative functions of government having been\r\nassumed by the Administrative Council (Consejo de Administración) of\r\nwhich the president and fiscal, and usually two oidores at least were\r\nmembers. Thus, even after the reform of 1861, the oidores continued\r\nto participate in legislative functions, though the audiencia as a\r\nbody did not. [449]\r\n\r\nTypical of the multitudinous duties of the governor, and illustrative\r\nat the same time of his relations with the audiencia, were the various\r\nsubjects treated in the Instruction of the king to Governor Pedro de\r\nAcuña, dated February 16, 1602, [450] which is chosen for citation\r\nhere because of its comprehensive character, and also because of\r\nits availability. Beginning with the reminder that the governor\r\nshould confer with the Viceroy of New Spain whenever necessary, this\r\ncomprehensive paper treated first of the defense of the Islands against\r\nthe Japanese, and of the maintenance of a garrison in Mindanao. The\r\nmatter of tribute was taken up, and the desirability was shown of\r\nhaving the natives pay tribute in kind rather than in money. It was\r\nsaid that the latter method encouraged the natives to indolence,\r\nfor as soon as they had earned enough money to pay their tribute they\r\nceased work altogether. The governor was advised to consult with the\r\naudiencia in regard to this matter. The king ordered the governor\r\nto cut down expenses and to economize by the elimination of as many\r\noffices as possible. He recommended, in particular, the abolition of\r\nthe offices of corregidor and alcalde mayor.\r\n\r\nThe king warned Acuña against a continuation of the dishonesty of\r\npast governors in the lading of ships for New Spain. He declared that\r\nthereafter the allotment of freight should not be left to the friends\r\nof the governor, but the matter should be personally supervised by the\r\ngovernor and an oidor. The frauds which had been common also in the\r\nassignment of encomiendas in the colony must cease; to effect this the\r\ngovernor was temporarily deprived of jurisdiction over this matter. Who\r\nwas to assign the encomiendas in the future was not divulged. [451]\r\n\r\nThe governor was instructed to see that the salable offices were\r\nnot conferred on the relatives of the oidores, nor given to his own\r\nrelatives, but that they should be disposed of to persons offering\r\nthe most money for them. It had been charged that governors and\r\naudiencias had connived together in the past to deprive persons of\r\noffices to which they were legitimately entitled. This had been done\r\nby allowing favorites to hold more than one office, and by favoritism\r\nin the sale of these positions. These abuses must be stopped, the king\r\nsaid; it was ordered that in the future no person should be allowed\r\nto hold more than one office, that as many of these as possible should\r\nbe sold, with unrestricted competitive bidding.\r\n\r\nThe governor and the fiscal were ordered to exercise care and diligence\r\nin the inspection of the returning galleon, to see especially that\r\nit brought no unregistered money from persons in Mexico. Acuña's\r\npredecessor, Tello, had recommended that west-bound galleons should\r\nstop at the Ladrones to leave priests and soldiers, and to minister\r\nto the needs of Spaniards already there. This was authorized and\r\nthe governor was instructed to see that it was done. The governor\r\nwas also ordered on this occasion to make an investigation of the\r\naudiencia. Complaints had been coming to the court for a long time\r\nagainst the laxity of the tribunal in the administration of justice,\r\nand of the commercial activities of the oidores. The governor was to\r\naid the fiscal in the prosecution of any oidores who were remiss, to\r\nthe extent of sending them under arrest to New Spain if the charges\r\nagainst them justified such action.\r\n\r\nThis Instruction, it will be noted, required the governor to\r\nintervene actively in practically all the governmental affairs that\r\ncame up in the colony. He was to exercise authority with regard to\r\ndefense, finance, and revenue. He was to exercise supervision over\r\nprovincial affairs so as to insure the good treatment of the natives\r\nand the beneficent administration of the encomiendas. He was to give\r\nhis attention to the galleon trade and to the disposal of offices\r\nwithin the colony. If doubt or difficulty arose in any of these\r\nmatters of administration, he was to demand from the audiencia, its\r\nassistance, counsel, and support. The governor was also authorized\r\nto see that justice was administered effectively, though he was not\r\nto intervene directly in that matter, except to see that abuses were\r\neradicated. This Instruction shows that the governor was regarded as\r\nthe chief executive of the government. He was the responsible head in\r\nthe judicial, administrative, and military spheres. The audiencia,\r\non the other hand, had consultative functions, aimed to assist the\r\ngovernor when he required it, but to restrict him when he sought to\r\nexceed his powers. Instructions similar to this were given to many\r\nsucceeding governors. A citation of these would prove nothing new,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner that the Instruction to Acuña gives us an idea of\r\nthe relative functions of the audiencia and the governorship in 1602,\r\nso the criticisms of the able Spanish diplomat, Sinibaldo de Mas,\r\nwritten in 1842, aid us in estimating their respective spheres in the\r\nnineteenth century. This opinion is valuable because it summarizes\r\nthe result of two hundred and fifty years of the interaction of these\r\npolitical institutions in the Islands. Mas showed the reason for the\r\nestablishment of the intendancy, and the conferring of added powers\r\nupon the audiencia and criticized the relations existing between the\r\ngovernor and these institutions in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n    To set some balance to his power (that of the governor), because of\r\n    the distance from the throne, certain privileges and preëminences\r\n    have been granted to other persons, especially to the Audiencia,\r\n    even to the point of making of the latter a court of appeal\r\n    against the measures of the chief of the islands. Besides,\r\n    the revenues have been removed from his jurisdiction, and the\r\n    office of the intendant has been constituted, who obeys no\r\n    others than the orders communicated to him by the ministry of\r\n    the treasury from Madrid. It is very obvious that this single\r\n    point is quite sufficient to paralyze completely the action of\r\n    the governor-general. Besides, since there are many matters which\r\n    require to be passed on by distinct ministries, it happens that\r\n    two contrary orders touch the same matter, or that one order is\r\n    lacking, which is enough to render its execution impossible ... a\r\n    chief may detain a communication, even after he has received it,\r\n    if it does not suit him. This system of setting obstacles in the\r\n    way of the governor of a distant colony is wise and absolutely\r\n    necessary, ... there results rather than a balance among the\r\n    various departments of authority a confusion of jurisdictions,\r\n    the fatal fount of eternal discord. [452]\r\n\r\n\r\nMas made extensive quotations which were calculated to show \"the\r\ngreat confusion and contrariety of the orders to governor and\r\naudiencia.\" This characteristic of the laws of the Indies has\r\nrepeatedly been referred to in this treatise, and we shall note\r\nits results in a subsequent chapter dealing with the conflicts of\r\njurisdiction between the audiencia and the governor.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that the decision of the governor was not final\r\nin administrative affairs. Persons dissatisfied with his executive\r\nactions or decisions in such matters were privileged to appeal to the\r\naudiencia. If the findings of the tribunal differed from those of the\r\ngovernor, and if the governor were still unyielding, his will was to\r\nbe obeyed but the case was thereupon appealed to the Council of the\r\nIndies. [453] If the case were one of law and justice the governor,\r\non the other hand, was instructed to abide by the decision of the\r\naudiencia, but he was privileged to carry the case to the Council of\r\nthe Indies. Thus it was that each of these authorities had a sphere\r\nwherein its word was law, and its decisions final in the colony.\r\n\r\nIt was prescribed, however, that when there were differences of opinion\r\nbetween the governor and the audiencia an effort should be made both\r\nby the governor and the audiencia to avoid notorious disagreements\r\nwhich would furnish a bad example to the natives, or otherwise degrade\r\nthe dignity of the royal tribunal or governor. Viceroys, presidents,\r\nand audiencias were forbidden to take action in cases wherein there\r\nwas doubt as to their jurisdiction, or wherein there was a question\r\nas to the advisability of taking final action. [454]\r\n\r\nIt would appear, therefore, from this survey of the laws, that the\r\naudiencia was provided with ample means for restraining the action\r\nof the governor. This it could do either by admonition, by appealing\r\nfrom his decisions in administrative matters, or by blocking him in\r\nthe acuerdo. It was evidently the design of those who planned the\r\nlegislation of the Indies to guard at all times against the excesses\r\nof an all-powerful executive. Such was certainly the purpose of\r\nthe establishment of the audiencia, both in the Americas and in the\r\nPhilippines. Taking into consideration the three hundred years of\r\nPhilippine history, however, it cannot be said that in the actual\r\noperation of the government these precautions were entirely effective.\r\n\r\nAccording to the laws of the Indies the governor, as executive, had\r\nhis own sphere in which the oidores were forbidden to interfere. [455]\r\nIn the light of our investigation, however, it would appear that\r\nthis exclusive field was exceedingly limited, and that even it was\r\ncontinually subject to the encroachments of the audiencia. In the\r\nexercise of his military authority the governor was independent\r\nof the tribunal, although we shall see that on some occasions the\r\naudiencia exercised military jurisdiction in an executive capacity,\r\nand that there were times when the governor was glad to call upon\r\nthe audiencia for assistance in this matter. As president of the\r\naudiencia the governor exercised considerable authority during the\r\nfirst half of the history of the colony, but from 1776 to 1861 his\r\nposition as president was merely nominal, and at the latter date it\r\nwas abolished. He was the chief administrative official of the colony,\r\nand his authority in this particular was more far-reaching than in\r\nany other. In this, however, he was limited by the acuerdo of the\r\naudiencia, which developed, as we have seen, from an advisory to a\r\nlegislative function, and ultimately had the effect of limiting the\r\ngovernor in his hitherto exclusive field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE AUDIENCIA AND THE GOVERNOR: THE MILITARY JURISDICTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe isolation of the Philippines, their distance from the home\r\ncountry and New Spain, and their proximity to the colonies and trade\r\nroutes of rival nations, made the problem of defense the foremost\r\nconsideration. This was almost equally true of New Spain, Perú, and\r\nthe West Indian colonies, all of which were exposed to the attack\r\nof outside enemies, though, of course, they were neither as isolated\r\nnor as far away as the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of being ever on the alert, constantly prepared to resist\r\ninvasion and to put down insurrection, gave a military character to\r\nthe governments of these colonies. The viceroys and governors were in\r\nmost cases trained soldiers. In addition to their other prerogatives,\r\nthey exercised the office and title of captain-general and as such\r\nthey commanded the military and naval forces of their colonies,\r\ninadequate as these forces sometimes were. During the first two\r\nhundred years governors and viceroys were largely selected on the basis\r\nof their past military exploits on the continent or in America. The\r\nadministrations of the different Philippine governors of the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries were characterized rather by their devotion\r\nto military affairs than by economic improvements or administrative\r\nefficiency. The supervision of judicial and governmental affairs\r\nwas thus left for long periods in the hands of other officials and\r\nauthorities, to be reclaimed or fought over by the governors when\r\ntheir time was not taken up by military conquests.\r\n\r\nIt is practically agreed among all authorities who have written on\r\nthe Philippines that the leading consideration and necessity of the\r\ngovernment during two hundred years was military defense. These writers\r\ncomprise officials who saw service there and commentators who visited\r\nthe Islands and studied the government. In their recommendations and\r\ncomments they unite in urging that the defense of the Islands should\r\nnot be neglected; that the governor should be given adequate forces\r\nwith sufficient jurisdiction over them and over the other elements\r\nof the colony to defend it successfully from invasion or insurrection.\r\n\r\nIt was the policy of the government throughout the history of\r\nthe Islands to conserve and keep intact the governor's military\r\njurisdiction. We have noted in an earlier chapter that one of the\r\nmain reasons for the suppression of the audiencia in 1589 was that\r\nit interfered too extensively with the military jurisdiction of\r\nthe governor. During the decade following the extinction of the\r\ntribunal, the military governors were given almost unlimited powers,\r\nuntil their abuses led to the re-establishment of the tribunal to\r\nguard against these excesses. We shall see in the following chapter\r\nthat the limitations placed upon them by the audiencia were always a\r\nsource of complaint by the various governors. Governor Acuña went so\r\nfar as to recommend the suppression of the tribunal because the needs\r\nof the colony were military and had to be met by the firm action of\r\na soldier, without the interference of a body of magistrates. [456]\r\nSimilar recommendations were made by a majority of the succeeding\r\ngovernors, but more especially by Fajardo, Corcuera, Vargas, Arandía,\r\nand even by Anda who had risen from the post of oidor to that of\r\ngovernor and military commander. [457]\r\n\r\nThe conviction that the government should be pre-eminently military was\r\nnot held by governors alone. Fernando de los Ríos Coronel, procurator\r\nof the Philippines at the Court of Madrid in 1597, urged that the\r\ngovernment should be of a military character and that the practice\r\nof sending soldiers to govern the Islands should be continued. [458]\r\nThis opinion was also advanced by Fray Alonso Sánchez, procurator\r\nof the Islands at Madrid in 1589, and the emissary whose arguments\r\nwere chiefly instrumental in bringing about the suppression of the\r\naudiencia. [459] Francisco Leandro de Viana, the most efficient\r\nfiscal that the Islands ever had, and afterwards councillor of\r\nthe Indies, recognized the military attributes of the governor's\r\nposition. He urged a separation of the spheres of the governor and\r\nthe audiencia, recommending that the former should attend solely to\r\nwar and government, while the latter should confine itself to matters\r\nof justice. [460]\r\n\r\nThis opinion was shared by Juan José Delgado, the able Jesuit\r\nhistorian, who expressed the conviction that the \"islands need\r\ndisinterested military governors, not merchants; and men of resolution\r\nand character, not students, who are more fit to govern monasteries\r\nthan communities of heroes.\" [461] Delgado recommended that governors\r\nof the Philippines should be picked men, selected for their military\r\nqualities. The distance and isolation of the colony and its proximity\r\nto the great empires of China and Japan made defense the first\r\nrequisite. Delgado believed that a soldier would be less amenable\r\nto bribes and that commercial ventures would be less attractive to\r\nhim. [462] He recommended that governors should be absolute in affairs\r\nof government and war and that all departments and officials of the\r\ngovernment should be subject to him.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the independent commentators writing on the subject\r\nseem to have conceived of the duties of the governor as savoring\r\nmore of war than of peace, we may note that Manuel Bernáldez\r\nPizarro, for many years a resident and official in the Philippines,\r\nwriting in 1827, urged that the governors there should be efficient\r\nadministrators rather than soldiers. It must be remembered, however,\r\nthat the political conditions in the Philippines during his period\r\nwere widely different from those of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies when the Islands were constantly exposed to the attack\r\nof outside enemies and liable to insurrections within. The chief\r\nproblems of the nineteenth century were administrative, rather than\r\nmilitary. He pointed out that governors had already exhibited too much\r\nof the militant spirit in dealing with the problems of government,\r\n\"not heeding the opinions and customs of the country, but depending\r\non the force of arms,\" or their asesores. [463] This had the effect\r\nof causing dissensions between the governor and audiencia, and the\r\nresultant discord had furnished a very bad example for the natives\r\nand residents of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic tendency throughout the history, of the Islands\r\nto lay stress on the military side of the governor's position\r\nwas commented on by Montero y Vidal, the modern historian of the\r\nPhilippines, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The authority of the governor-general is complete, and so great a\r\n    number of attributes conferred on one functionary, incompetent,\r\n    as a general rule, for everything outside of military affairs,\r\n    is certainly prejudicial to the right exercise of his duty;\r\n    ... since 1822 the government has always devolved upon an official;\r\n    a general, and in the case of his death, a segundo cabo, and,\r\n    in case of the death of the latter, a commandant of the naval\r\n    station. [464]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the peace and the maintenance of the defense\r\nof the Islands was the chief responsibility and the most important\r\nduty of the governor and captain-general. Although the audiencia was\r\nordered to do all that it could to assist, nevertheless the tribunal\r\nwas strictly forbidden to restrict or hinder the governor in the\r\nexecution of his military duties. [465] The governor's position as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the king's forces, and his pre-eminence in\r\nmilitary affairs, were generally recognized.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the early laws conferred exclusive\r\nmilitary powers on the governor, a glance at three hundred years of\r\nSpanish colonial history will show that the audiencias participated\r\nin these matters in two different ways. In fact, an analysis of\r\nthe military jurisdiction shows the presence and the exercise,\r\nin general, of two kinds of activity. These consisted, first, of\r\na special judicial system for the trial of persons under military\r\nlaw and distinct from the civil jurisdiction, and second, of the\r\ncontrol and disposition of the military forces of the Islands, and\r\ntheir utilization for defense. One, therefore, was judicial, the\r\nother was administrative, but both of these forces of activity were\r\nwithin the military sphere. The problem of this chapter, therefore,\r\nconsists in determining the conditions, circumstances, and extent of\r\nthe audiencia's participation in military affairs, and of its relation\r\nto the authority and jurisdiction of the governor and captain-general.\r\n\r\nAs commander-in-chief, the governor was at the head of a special\r\njudicial system for the trial of soldiers under the military\r\nlaw. This judicial system was independent of the audiencia, and the\r\nlatter body, during the greater part of the history of the Islands,\r\nwas denied jurisdiction in these cases, even on appeal. [466] We\r\nhave already noted, however, the tendency of the law to excuse\r\nthese busy executives from direct participation in ordinary\r\njudicial activities. Notwithstanding the governor's status in the\r\nabove-mentioned particular, he seldom intervened personally in\r\nthe trial of such cases. His position with regard to the military\r\njurisdiction was similar to his relation with the audiencia, of which\r\nhe was president, but over which he seldom presided.\r\n\r\nThe actual trial of the criminal cases of soldiers was conducted in\r\nfirst instance by military tribunals and magistrates. Most prominent\r\namong the latter were the castellán and the maestre de campo. The\r\ncaptains, themselves, had certain judicial authority within their\r\ncompanies. [467] Appeals were made from these military judges of\r\nfirst instance to the captain-general. If there had been notorious\r\ninjustice or a grave infraction of the law in the trial of a case of\r\nfirst instance, it was the governor's duty either to refer the case\r\nto some other magistrate than to the one who originally tried it, or\r\nto a special judicial tribunal. An oidor might be designated to serve\r\nin this tribunal. When the magistrates served in this capacity they\r\nwere responsible entirely to the governor and were not identified\r\nwith the audiencia. Oidores frequently objected to this service,\r\nbut the governor was usually able to enforce these demands, which\r\nwere in accordance with the laws and approved by the home government.\r\n\r\nThe captain-general exercised the pardoning power. Under some\r\ncircumstances cases might be appealed to Spain, but in these suits,\r\nmost of which involved personal crimes and misdemeanors, the decision\r\nof the captain-general or the local military tribunal was usually\r\nfinal, if for no other reason than the fact that the soldiers in\r\nManila lacked the means to carry their cases further. Those cases\r\nwhich were appealed usually involved principles of law desirable to\r\nbe tested by reference to a higher tribunal. The junta de guerra\r\nde Indias received all appeals from the military officials of the\r\ncolonies and solved all questions of a judicial or administrative\r\ncharacter that were carried to it.\r\n\r\nThe junta de guerra consisted of four ministers of the Supreme Council\r\nof War who were designated to sit with an equal number of ministers\r\nof the Council of the Indies. [468] It was, in fact, the executive\r\ncommittee and at the same time the special tribunal of military affairs\r\nfor the Council of the Indies. It passed upon such military questions\r\nas were nominally referred to it by the president of the Council of\r\nthe Indies, although these cases automatically came to this junta\r\nwithout the intervention of the president of the Council. It had\r\njurisdiction over appeals in cases affecting soldiers tried in first\r\nor second instance in the colonies, over the administrative matters of\r\narmament and defense: the equipment of fleets and military operations,\r\ngarrisons, military supplies, and munitions. It also tried appeals from\r\nthe tribunal of the Casa de Contratación, and, in fact, it exercised\r\ngeneral supervision over that institution in its various activities.\r\n\r\nThis was the machinery which existed for the adjudication of military\r\ncases during the greater part of the history of the Islands, the\r\nmagistrates of the audiencia officiating as auditores de guerra when\r\ndesignated by the governor. [469] The royal decree of January 30, 1855,\r\nmade a radical reform in this particular, adding two new magistrates,\r\nan auditor de guerra and an auditor de marina and to some extent\r\nrelieving the ministers of the audiencia. These magistrates were\r\nappointed by the Minister of War and had original and secondary\r\njurisdiction over cases involving soldiers and sailors of the\r\nfleet. These new magistrates served as ministers of the audiencia\r\nwhen their special duties permitted, and they were ordered to consult\r\nwith the governor from time to time in regard to matters pertaining to\r\ntheir respective fields. Though the audiencia was forbidden to concern\r\nitself with cases which belonged to the military jurisdiction, the\r\nregent and two magistrates of the tribunal, acting with the auditor\r\nde guerra or the auditor de marina, could resolve themselves into a\r\nspecial court for the trial in second instance of cases pertaining\r\nto the respective fields of the last two officials. [470]\r\n\r\nTwo or three cases may be described here which illustrate the method of\r\nprocedure in the trial of military cases by the tribunals. On January\r\n22, 1787, a royal order was issued on the recommendation of the junta\r\nde guerra de Indias, approving of a sentence of death pronounced upon\r\na soldier in the Philippines four years before. This soldier had been\r\nsentenced in first instance by the castellán. The captain-general, on\r\nappeal, affirmed the sentence, and the junta de guerra approved the\r\nproceedings when the case was appealed a second time. [471] Another\r\ncase, and one which illustrates the slowness of the proceedings of\r\nthis junta, as well as the nature of its jurisdiction, was that of a\r\nsoldier who had set fire to a powder magazine, causing it to explode,\r\nthereby killing several persons. The culprit was sentenced by the\r\nconsejo ordinario de guerra, a sort of local military and strategic\r\ncommittee, composed of local military officers (in this case a kind\r\nof court-martial), [472] but Governor Basco y Vargas, upon the advice\r\nof his asesor, suspended sentence, directing the case to the junta de\r\nguerra. Nothing was done, however, and on December 10, 1788, Governor\r\nMarquina, successor to Basco y Vargas, wrote to the president of the\r\nCouncil of the Indies, calling attention to the fact that this soldier\r\nhad been in prison for six years awaiting the action of the Council\r\nof the Indies. [473] The matter was then referred to the junta and\r\nthe sentence was approved by that tribunal.\r\n\r\nAs in all other departments and activities of government, so\r\nin this, there were many opportunities for conflict between the\r\naudiencia and the governor as to authority over cases which by\r\ntheir nature bordered on the sphere of both the civil and military\r\njurisdictions. The governor who had the power to assign cases to\r\nwhatever tribunal he chose, often took advantage of his position to\r\nbring the trial of civil cases within his own military sphere. Among\r\nthese were suits involving the militiamen. These were subject to the\r\nmilitary jurisdiction when they were under arms, and at other times,\r\nbeing civilians, they were subject to the civil authorities. [474]\r\nAn instance of a case of this kind occurred in 1800. A militiaman,\r\nJosef Ruy, had killed an Indian, and the audiencia, on the basis of\r\nits authority over Indians, had sentenced the culprit to death. The\r\ngovernor, after sentence was passed, reopened the case on the ground\r\nthat as a member of the militia, Ruy was subject to the military\r\nand not to the civil jurisdiction, although the militia was not\r\nat that time in active service. The judgment of the audiencia was\r\ntherefore suspended. The case, meanwhile, had been appealed to the\r\nCouncil of the Indies, and that tribunal had approved the sentence of\r\nthe audiencia, apparently without taking note of the fact that the\r\ncase involved the military jurisdiction. A short time afterward the\r\nCouncil received a second report from the audiencia, stating that\r\njurisdiction over the case had been surrendered to the governor on\r\naccount of its military character. This procedure was accordingly\r\napproved by the Council. Soon after, report came of the receipt by\r\nthe audiencia of the former judgment of the Council, relative to the\r\naction first taken by the audiencia, with the information that since\r\nthe will of the Council was known, the governor had surrendered the\r\nprisoner again to the jurisdiction of the audiencia. Disgusted at\r\nthe contradiction and cross-purposes at which the authorities in\r\nthe Islands were working, the king decreed on March 27, 1802, that\r\ncases involving Indians should be tried in the audiencia, but that\r\nthis poor wretch had been tried and retried, condemned and condemned\r\nover again so often that he had already expatiated his crime. He was\r\naccordingly authorized to go free. [475]\r\n\r\nThe king administered a severe reprimand to the governor and oidores on\r\nthis occasion for their insistence on these small points of personal\r\ndignity in which the real purpose of the law was entirely overlooked\r\nin the pompous insistence of these officials on what they imagined\r\nto be their own particular rights. The case just alluded to began\r\nin 1792, and was carried through ten years of petty strife. The\r\nblame for this cannot be ascribed entirely to the magistrates of\r\nthe audiencia, or to the governor, who had to act in accordance with\r\nthe law as he interpreted it. The real fault lay in the failure of\r\nthe Spanish governmental system to place implicit confidence in the\r\njudgment and ability of its servants. Considering the final ends of\r\njustice, it made little difference whether sentence was pronounced\r\nupon this individual by the governor as military commander, or as\r\npresident of the audiencia. It is true that the authorities might\r\nhave compromised on many occasions; indeed, from the viewpoint of\r\nhistory it may be said that they should have done so, instead of so\r\noften wasting their energies on these petty battles. These incessant\r\ndisputes were encouraged and facilitated by the ease with which appeals\r\ncould be made to Spain, thus hindering the immediate execution of\r\ndecisions. The Council of the Indies interfered in details which should\r\nhave been left entirely to the colonial authorities. This interference\r\nencouraged appeal, and matters of no relative importance to Spain's\r\ncolonial empire frequently occupied a large share of the attention\r\nof the sovereign tribunal. Colonial officials were not entrusted with\r\nthe authority and responsibility which they should have had, and the\r\ncentral government wasted its time attending to small affairs which\r\nshould have been concluded by subordinates in the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe governor frequently claimed jurisdiction over cases involving\r\nretired soldiers on the grounds that they had once been under the\r\nfuero militar. He also claimed jurisdiction in suits affecting widows\r\nof soldiers, all of which, in accordance with the law of December\r\n11, 1788, should have been tried by the audiencia. [476] Another\r\nabuse frequently perpetrated by the governor was the assumption of\r\njurisdiction over suits for the payment by military officials of bonds\r\nwhich they had assumed for defaulted civil officials. [477] In doing\r\nthis he was encroaching on the rights of the oficiales reales, and\r\nthese were always supported by the audiencia in the contentions which\r\narose over this question. Cases involving conflicts of jurisdiction\r\nbetween the civil and military authorities were appealed to the Council\r\nof the Indies, and there, after considerable delay, the proper sphere\r\nof authority was always determined.\r\n\r\nWhile the audiencia as a tribunal was forbidden jurisdiction in the\r\ntrial of cases involving war, we have already shown that the governor\r\nexercised the right of designating oidores to try cases of this nature\r\non second appeal. The power of enforcing this right depended entirely\r\non the governor. Frequently the efforts of the governor along these\r\nlines were attended with much difficulty as were those of Governor\r\nMarquina in 1789 when he sought to designate an oidor to assist in the\r\ntrial of Antonio Callejo, naval artilleryman on a frigate of war. The\r\ncase had first been tried before the proper military judge, but it\r\nwas referred on appeal to a tribunal of which an alcalde ordinario of\r\nthe city was a member. The governor designated Oidor Yuguanzo to act\r\nas a member of this tribunal for the trial of the case of Callejo on\r\nreview. The magistrate begged to be excused on the ground that all his\r\ntime was occupied with the trial of civil cases in the audiencia. The\r\ngovernor called on all the other oidores successively, and all\r\ndeclined to act. At last he peremptorily ordered Yuguanzo to serve,\r\ntelling him that if he objected he might carry the matter to the king\r\nin the regular way, which, according to the laws of the Indies, was to\r\ncomply with the governor's demands, under protest, while appealing the\r\nquestion of disagreement to the Council of the Indies. [478] This was\r\naccordingly done, the magistrate basing his claim to exemption on the\r\nlaw which prohibited the governor from sending oidores on commissions\r\noutside the audiencia. [479] The governor at the same time filed a\r\nmemorial which forestalled all the arguments of the oidor. [480] He\r\nstated that the real cause of the disinclination of the magistrates of\r\nthe audiencia to serve as auditores de guerra was their indolence, and\r\nnot the pressure of their excessive duties. It was contrary to their\r\nideas of dignity to be associated with the acting auditor de guerra,\r\nwho was not a letrado, and it was therefore considered a sacrifice of\r\ntheir own personal dignity. The governor stated that no argument could\r\njustify such an attitude on the part of the oidores. The inconsistency\r\nof their position was further shown, he alleged, by the fact that they\r\nhad served regularly on the tribunal of appeals of the consulado, in\r\ncompany with two merchants who were not even lawyers. Hence there could\r\nbe no reason for their refusal to serve with an alcalde ordinario.\r\n\r\nThe governor based his right to call upon the regular magistrates for\r\nthis service on that section of the laws of the Indies applying\r\nto Española, Nuevo Reino, and Tierra Firme, which declared\r\nthat jurisdiction over cases affecting soldiers belonged to the\r\ncaptain-general with inhibition of the audiencia, and that soldiers,\r\nduring the time they were under arms, should not be tried on criminal\r\ncharges. [481] The governor, according to this law, might call\r\nupon a magistrate to serve as special auditor de guerra for the\r\ndetermination of cases in second instance. Finally, by April 20,\r\n1784, the king had extended this rule to all other colonies. [482]\r\nAlthough we have no record of the reply of the tribunal in Spain,\r\nthe strength of the governor's position could not well be questioned,\r\nespecially since he was resting his case on a law made in 1784,\r\nwhich was completely up-to-date, while the magistrate's contention\r\nwas based on one promulgated in 1609. [483]\r\n\r\nAside from the duty of the oidores to try military cases when\r\ncommissioned by the governor to do so, it will be seen that the\r\ntribunal itself exercised much more extensive authority in the\r\nactual administration of military affairs. Two factors may be said\r\nto have contributed to this. One was the fact that the audiencia\r\nwas frequently consulted by the king or governor in regard to\r\nthe defense of the colony. The other may be seen in the actual\r\nassumption of the government at various times by the audiencia, and\r\nthe successful defense of the Islands by the military forces under\r\nthe leadership of the oidores. Notwithstanding the fact that the\r\ngovernor's recognized sphere of action was military, and in spite of\r\nthe repeated prohibitions against the interference of the tribunal\r\nin these matters, the audiencia received considerable official\r\nencouragement and authorization to interest itself in military affairs.\r\n\r\nAs the problems of general administration were too serious for\r\nthe solution of one man without advisors, so the governor also\r\nfound it frequently undesirable to assume sole responsibility for\r\nmilitary affairs. The audiencia shared the acuerdo power in these\r\nmatters to a lesser degree than it did in government. The hostility\r\nof the Japanese in the early years, the fear of the Chinese, the\r\ndanger of native outbreaks, the raids of the Moro pirates, and the\r\nincursions of the Portuguese, Dutch, and English aroused the fears\r\nof the commonwealth to such an extent that defense was felt to be a\r\nmatter of common concern. The governor, upon whom legally rested the\r\nobligations and responsibilities of defense, was glad to share these\r\nduties with any authority that could be of assistance. The history\r\nof the Philippines is replete with instances in which the audiencia\r\neither gave counsel in matters pertaining to defense, or took an\r\nactive part in resistance. There were even occasions on which it\r\nadvocated offensive warfare. [484]\r\n\r\nWe have seen in an earlier chapter that the audiencia manifested a keen\r\ninterest in military affairs immediately upon its establishment. In the\r\nchapter on the establishment of the tribunal we noted the memorials\r\nof individual oidores and of the audiencia as a tribunal, advising\r\nthe governor and the king as to the necessity of conquering the Moros,\r\nand on the best way of putting down insurrections in the Islands. The\r\nquestion of defense against the Portuguese and the Dutch was also\r\ndiscussed in the letters of the oidores. In some cases their advice\r\nwas considered, on other occasions the governor complained against\r\nthem for exceeding their jurisdiction. One of the most noteworthy\r\ninstances of the recognized intervention of the oidores in military\r\nmatters was on April 19, 1586, when a council, called together by\r\nGovernor Sande and consisting of the governor, the bishop, and the\r\noidores, considered the immediate occupation of China. This was urged\r\nby Governor Sande, but he was overruled by the moderate counsels of\r\nthe bishop and magistrates. [485]\r\n\r\nNo better illustration of the willingness of the governor to share\r\nhis military responsibilities can be given than the reliance\r\nof Governor Dasmariñas on the religious authorities for advice\r\nin military affairs, after the suppression of the audiencia in\r\n1589. [486] He consulted with them on ways and means of defending the\r\ncolony against the Japanese, whose threatening attitude during his\r\nadministration rendered precarious the continuance of Spanish power\r\nin the Islands. On one occasion he consulted the religious orders\r\nas to the advisability of expelling all Japanese and Chinese traders\r\nfrom Manila. The accumulation of provisions against a possible siege,\r\nthe seizure of the persons and property of all Japanese residents,\r\nthe establishment of a place of refuge for women, children, and\r\nsick persons in case of invasion, and the appropriation of the\r\nproperty of the natives as a pledge of their good behavior in the\r\nevent of hostilities, were measures proposed by the governor to the\r\nreligious for their consideration. Dasmariñas, on another occasion,\r\nasked the advice of the Augustinians, Dominicans, and Jesuits as\r\nto the best manner of dealing with an insurrection in Zambales,\r\nand the religious authorities, after quoting scholars, saints, and\r\ntheologians, made lengthy recommendations. [487] These facts make\r\nclear the unwillingness of this governor to take the initiative in\r\naffairs pertaining to his own special province. He was content to ask\r\nand receive the advice of priests, monks, and magistrates, on military\r\naffairs. He was willing to seek the counsel of any and all available\r\npersons or authorities who could or would advise him. It is, of course,\r\nclear that the audiencia, when in existence, would be preferred as\r\na source of advice and counsel to a community of religious.\r\n\r\nNot only did the governor set a precedent of seeking the advice of\r\nthe audiencia during this early period, but the king often sought the\r\nopinion of the magistrates in regard to military affairs. Various\r\nmatters were referred by the sovereign to the oidores at different\r\ntimes: questions involving the building of walls and fortifications\r\nof Manila, and the number and size of cannon needed for the proper\r\nequipment of the latter; the audiencia was asked whether it would\r\nbe better to bring gunpowder from New Spain or to manufacture it in\r\nthe Islands; the magistrates were required on several occasions to\r\nfurnish information as to the number of men needed for the defense\r\nof the Islands, and whether the natives would make good soldiers. The\r\naudiencia furnished information to the king concerning the availability\r\nof the various Philippine woods for shipbuilding, and it furnished\r\nestimates as to the probable cost of ships both for commerce and\r\nwar. [488] All these matters were supposed to come within the special\r\nmilitary jurisdiction of the governor, yet, not only that official,\r\nbut the king himself, required the advice of the magistrates on\r\nthese questions.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Mindanao and the war in the Moluccas were also subjects\r\nof correspondence between the court and the local audiencia. [489]\r\nThe king, on various occasions, requested information of the oidores\r\nconcerning the natives and their attitude towards law and order,\r\nwhether the various tribes were quiet, by nature peaceful or warlike,\r\nand what measures, in the opinions of the magistrates, would be best in\r\ndealing with them. The audiencia was consulted on other occasions as to\r\nthe best manner of fortifying the Visayan Islands against the attacks\r\nof the Moros, and northern Luzón against the Chinese and Japanese,\r\nthe possible cost and most suitable locations of fortifications,\r\nand their availability and probable value in repelling invasions.\r\n\r\nThe reliance of the governor and the court upon the magistrates of the\r\naudiencia for advice in the matter of defense was not characteristic\r\nonly of the early years of Philippine history. In 1744 Governor Torre\r\nsubmitted his scheme for the fortification of the city of Manila to\r\nthe audiencia before he sent it to the king for final approval. [490]\r\nTorre was aided by a regular council of war (consejo de guerra) of\r\nwhich the oidores were members and he submitted questions relative\r\nto the defense of the Islands to this council. In 1746, this local\r\ncouncil of war reported on the advisability and feasibility of\r\nmanufacturing guns and powder in the colony. [491] Governor Obando,\r\nwriting in 1748 to the king, and commenting on the relationship of\r\nthe previous governor with the audiencia in the matter of defense,\r\ndivided between his predecessor and the audiencia the responsibility\r\nfor the payment of ten thousand pesos to bribe the Dutch to keep away\r\nfrom the city, and not to reduce it. [492] In a subsequent chapter we\r\nshall discuss the important part played by the audiencia in the defense\r\nand surrender of the Islands to the British in 1762. These incidents,\r\ntaken at random from various governors' administrations, show that the\r\naudiencia was required to do all that it could to assist the governor\r\nand captain-general in the defense of the colony. It was also called\r\nupon to advise the court on military affairs; thus it was frequently\r\nable to assist in formulating and guiding the policies of the home\r\ngovernment with regard to defense and military administration. In\r\nthis way an indirect, but distinct check was placed upon the governor\r\nin his own field, and an incapable or radical executive was thus\r\nprevented from endangering the peace and security of the colony.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of the audiencia operated much more effectively\r\nin defense of the colony than through the advice which it rendered\r\neither to the king or to the governor. From 1601 to 1625, during which\r\nperiod the residents of the colony were continually alarmed by the\r\nunceasing encroachments of the Dutch, the audiencia was frequently\r\nobliged to assume responsibility for the defense of the colony. In\r\n1600 and 1601, when Francisco Tello de Guzmán was governor, Antonio de\r\nMorga, the senior oidor, led an expedition against the Dutch pirate\r\nVan Noordt and defeated him in Manila Bay. In 1607, the audiencia,\r\nthen in charge of the government, maintained the defense of Manila\r\nand Cavite against the Dutch. [493] While Governor Pedro de Acuña\r\nwas absent in the Moluccas in 1605-1606 on a campaign of conquest,\r\nthe audiencia entertained and responded to a petition from the king\r\nof Tidore for assistance in resisting the oppression of the king\r\nof Ternate. The war in the Moluccas was continued by the interim\r\ngovernment of the audiencia (1606-1608).\r\n\r\nThe audiencia repeatedly assumed charge of the government during\r\nthe frequent absences of Governor Juan de Silva (1609-1616) on\r\nexpeditions of conquest; and it governed two years after his death\r\n(1616-1618). Under the leadership of Oidor Andrés de Alcaraz the\r\nmilitary and naval forces of the Islands repeatedly repelled the\r\ninvasions of the Dutch. [494] Of special merit was the work of this\r\noidor in the preparation and equipment of a fleet of seven galleons\r\nwhich he led in the battle of Playa Honda, on April 14, 1617. In\r\norder to raise money with which to meet the expenses of this campaign,\r\nthe audiencia was compelled to resort to the extraordinary recourse\r\nof seizing the money of Manila merchants on its arrival from Acapulco\r\non the galleon. It also forced loans from residents and officials who\r\nwere in the colony. The audiencia authorized the sale and the payment\r\nin advance for space on the galleon of the coming year. Alcaraz,\r\nin a report to the king, stated that the oidores had labored with\r\ndiligence for the defense of the colony, personally concerning\r\nthemselves with the casting of artillery, the drilling of soldiers,\r\nthe obtaining of supplies, and in otherwise preparing the city for\r\nmore adequate defense. [495]\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of the able soldiers and captains-general, Juan\r\nNiño de Tavora (1626-1632), Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera (1634-1635),\r\nand Diego Fajardo (1644-1653), the audiencia interfered but little\r\nwith the notable military operations of that period. Exception to this\r\nstatement must be made in the cases of the capture and relinquishment\r\nof the island of Formosa in 1629 and 1642, respectively. The audiencia\r\nwas unreservedly opposed to the proposed conquest of the island\r\nby Governor Tavora, who, nevertheless, undertook the expedition\r\nand carried it to a successful conclusion. When Governor Corcuera\r\ndecided that the position of the Spaniards in Formosa was untenable\r\nand resolved to withdraw the garrison, the audiencia was equally\r\nforceful in its remonstrances. It sent charges to the court against\r\nthe governor, alleging that this loss, and that of the Moluccas the\r\nyear before would assuredly lead to the greater disaster of the loss\r\nof the Philippines. [496]\r\n\r\nThe important part played by the audiencia in the defense of\r\nManila against the British in 1762 will be discussed in another\r\nchapter. While Governor Rojo and the majority of the oidores were\r\nin the city, surrounded by the enemy, Oidor Anda y Salazar, who had\r\nbeen sent to the provinces as visitor, organized and maintained a\r\ndefense against the enemy. When he was commanded by the governor to\r\nsurrender, he refused, successfully maintaining the claim that as\r\nthe sole, legally-appointed oidor who had not surrendered, he was\r\nboth audiencia and governor, and as such his actions were legal. His\r\nclaims were recognized and approved by the king. This is perhaps the\r\nmost peculiar and extraordinary example of the audiencia's assumption\r\nof military power.\r\n\r\nThe frequent assumption of the government by the audiencia, with\r\nresponsibility for matters of defense and military administration\r\nmay be cited as an additional reason for its reluctance to\r\nentirely abandon its interest in these affairs on the arrival of a\r\ngovernor. Notwithstanding this, and the additional fact that the king\r\nand governor frequently consulted the audiencia on military affairs,\r\nthe tribunal did not always seek to retain preëminence in military\r\naffairs. This fact is shown by a letter which the audiencia wrote in\r\n1598, acknowledging that \"the only cases in which the governor is\r\nentitled to entire jurisdiction are those over soldiers--and these\r\ncases he may try independently, since he is captain-general.\" [497]\r\nThere were numerous other occasions on which the audiencia unreservedly\r\nrecognized the jurisdiction of the governor, often protesting against\r\nhis excesses in military matters, but going no further than to register\r\nits protestations. For instance, it charged Governor Fajardo with\r\ncarelessness in the outfitting of ships to resist the Dutch. One\r\nship, it was said, was so poorly equipped that it sank before it\r\nleft port. Fajardo was moreover accused of removing the commander of\r\none of these ships, substituting his fifteen-year-old brother, Luís\r\nFajardo, at a salary of 40,000 pesos. The audiencia contented itself\r\nwith remonstrances against these wrongs, but it made no attempt to\r\ninterfere. [498] Fajardo had his way in these matters, but he would\r\nhave been compelled to answer for them personally in his residencia\r\nhad he not died before that investigation took place.\r\n\r\nThe governor's accountability for the government of the Chinese was\r\nclosely related to his jurisdiction over military affairs. The Chinese\r\nwere regarded with great suspicion by the residents of Manila, who\r\nlived in constant fear of an outbreak in the Parián, or of a descent\r\nupon the coast of Luzón by Chinese from without. The problem of the\r\nChinese was therefore essentially one of defense, and as such it\r\nwas entrusted to the governor and captain-general. Nevertheless, the\r\naudiencia claimed the right to intervene in many matters pertaining\r\nto the government of these people, and there was much dissension\r\nbetween the oidores and the governor over this question. The governor\r\non some occasions rigidly resisted the claims of the audiencia to\r\nexercise jurisdiction over the Chinese, and on others he invited\r\nthe participation of the tribunal. This state of affairs was brought\r\nabout by the seeming conflict of the laws bearing upon this question.\r\n\r\nThe earliest legislation to be found in the laws of the Indies dealing\r\nwith the government of the Chinese was enacted on April 15, 1603. [499]\r\nThis law forbade the alcaldes ordinarios to exercise jurisdiction\r\nover suits of the Chinese in the Parián, but it ordered that all cases\r\ninvolving them should be tried by a special alcalde of the Parián with\r\nright of appeal to the audiencia. A special judge was thus created\r\nby this law, with jurisdiction over the Chinese. [500] The purpose of\r\nthis enactment was to establish a system of judicial procedure for the\r\nChinese, whereby the latter might be kept apart from the Spaniards and\r\nnatives in judicial as well as in governmental administration. This\r\nnecessity was partly based on economic considerations, and partly\r\non racial and religious reasons; it was designed essentially for the\r\nprotection of the Spaniards. [501]\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the above law of April 15, 1603, the audiencia\r\nimmediately proceeded to concern itself with the government of the\r\nChinese. It claimed jurisdiction particularly over the right to issue\r\nlicenses allowing Chinese to reside and trade in the Philippines. This\r\nauthority was also claimed by the governor and captain-general,\r\nwho was responsible for the defense of the Islands. The audiencia\r\nalso proceeded to issue regulations for the Chinese trade, laying\r\nitself open to the charge of selfish interest in these commercial\r\nactivities. Complaints against the audiencia's intervention reaching\r\nthe court, new regulations were issued on November 4 and December 1,\r\n1606, which forbade the audiencia to concern itself with anything\r\nrelative to the government and administration of the Parián, or with\r\nthe Chinese who might come to the Islands for the purpose of trade,\r\nexcept at the solicitation of the governor. [502] In the letter\r\naccompanying these orders, the king informed Governor Acuña that\r\nalthough the Chinese in the Parián were under his charge, he was to\r\ntake no important steps for their government without first consulting\r\nthe audiencia. The inference of this law is clear, therefore, that the\r\naudiencia might have other activities than the purely judicial. This\r\nimplication gave rise later to a considerable difference of opinion,\r\nbut in consequence of this law the governor was established as the\r\nfountain of authority in Chinese affairs, with the oidores in a\r\nsecondary position.\r\n\r\nOn June 12, 1614, Philip III re-enacted the above law with some\r\nmodifications. The fiscal was made legal protector of the Chinese. He\r\nwas ordered to advise the alcalde of the Parián in legal matters\r\npertaining to them, and the alcalde was to take no important steps\r\nwithout the advice and assistance of the fiscal. [503] The governor\r\nwas ordered not to allow any ordinary or special judge, alcalde del\r\ncrimen, or oidor, to exercise jurisdiction in first instance over civil\r\nsuits or criminal cases of the Chinese, or to make inspections in the\r\nParián. The last clause of this law, however, qualified and rendered\r\ndubious the effect and meaning of the entire enactment, by adding,\r\n\"unless in a case so extraordinary, necessary and imperative that it\r\nmay appear convenient to limit this rule.\"\r\n\r\nIt will not be extraneous to point out here that this was a common\r\nweakness of many laws, by which they were frequently rendered\r\nentirely inapplicable. In this case, for example, the evident object\r\nwas to prevent the oidores from interfering in Chinese affairs,\r\nthus guaranteeing the government and administration by officials\r\nwho were endowed with knowledge and understanding of their racial\r\ncharacteristics and peculiarities, while centering the ultimate\r\nresponsibility for them in the governor. It was realized, however,\r\nthat exceptional cases might arise in which some other procedure\r\nmight be advisable, and accordingly a loophole was left whereby the\r\nentire law could be nullified. The audiencia was thus given a basis\r\nfor intervention in the government of the Chinese whenever it suited\r\nthe convenience of the magistrates. This defect is emphasized here\r\nbecause this particular exception justified the intervention of the\r\naudiencia on many occasions, and was a cause of continual contention\r\nbetween the governor and the audiencia in Chinese affairs.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is difficult to settle conclusively the question of\r\nthe extent of jurisdiction which the governor and the audiencia,\r\nrespectively, exercised over the Chinese in the Parián, a few cases\r\nmay be presented in this connection to show that both the governor and\r\nthe audiencia were justified by royal authority in advancing claims to\r\ncontrol. On December 4, 1630, the king wrote a scathing arraignment of\r\nthe audiencia for having entertained an appeal from the Chinese over\r\nthe head of the governor, practically disregarding the latter, and for\r\nmaking recommendations relative to the Chinese and to military affairs,\r\nwhich questions were entirely outside its province. [504] One of the\r\nitems of the report of the recent visitor-general to the Philippines,\r\nLicentiate Francisco de Rojas y Ornate in 1629, had been a charge that\r\nthe audiencia had condemned and fined a Chinese merchant for smuggling\r\nmunitions of war into the colony, after the latter had proved that he\r\nhad been acting under the instructions of Governor Silva. [505] The\r\nvisitor-general took the position that this case was entirely within\r\nthe military sphere; therefore the governor's decision was final,\r\nand the audiencia was proceeding without jurisdiction in attempting\r\nto deal with it. The king called upon the tribunal to justify its\r\naction in the matter. [506] It is to be noted that in this case the\r\npoint at issue was not that the audiencia was interfering with a\r\nChinaman who should have been punished by another authority, but that\r\nin assuming jurisdiction the audiencia had infringed on the special\r\nprerogatives of the governor with regard to war and government. The\r\nfrequency and seriousness of the Chinese insurrections in the early\r\nseventeenth century, and the fear of a hostile invasion from China,\r\nplaced all questions of dealing with the Chinese upon a military basis,\r\nhence the authority of the governor.\r\n\r\nMuch correspondence of various kinds might be cited to show that\r\nthe governor was encouraged to consult the audiencia on Chinese\r\naffairs. Not only was the governor expected to do this, but the\r\nking himself directed many letters to the \"governor and audiencia\"\r\nand to the \"governor and oidores,\" in which he asked for advice and\r\ninformation bearing upon Chinese affairs. As we have already seen,\r\ncédulas treating of these matters were frequently expedited to the\r\n\"governor and audiencia.\" The audiencia was requested by the royal\r\nauthority on August 8, 1609, to submit information as to the truth of\r\nvarious statements by persons in the Islands that the Chinese were\r\ncarrying away vast quantities of silver. The audiencia was ordered\r\nto enact measures which would stop this abuse, which, if persisted\r\nin, would inevitably result in an impoverishment of the Philippine\r\ncommunity and government. The oidores were asked to suggest a course\r\nof action which would result in the retention of the Chinese trade\r\nand at the same time prevent the Chinese from doing irreparable damage\r\nto the royal exchequer in the ways alluded to. [507]\r\n\r\nIn further illustration of the same subject, we may note the\r\ninstructions of the king to Governor Silva, dated March 27, 1616. On\r\nthis occasion the king prescribed a course of action for the governor\r\nto follow in case of the invasion of the Islands by the Chinese and\r\nJapanese. He was especially directed to prevent a union of the Chinese\r\nin the Parián with the forces of the expected invaders. Silva was\r\nordered to take no steps without first consulting the oidores. [508]\r\nOn July 25, 1619, having received news of the insubordination of the\r\nChinese in Manila and of the danger of a revolt among them, the king\r\nwrote to the \"president and oidores\" expressing the belief that too\r\nmany Chinese had been admitted to the Islands and that thereafter only\r\nenough should be permitted to man the ships and carry on trade. [509]\r\nThe authorities to whom this letter was directed were charged not\r\nto allow the royal will relative to this matter to be disregarded,\r\nwhich, of course, implied the exercise of an executive power on the\r\npart of the magistrates, in addition to consultative authority.\r\n\r\nAgain, on December 31, 1630, the king wrote to the governor and\r\naudiencia, stating that there had been received at the court from the\r\nChinese of the Parián, a series of memorials, letters and petitions,\r\ncomplaining against the rigor of Spanish administration and requesting\r\nthat they might be governed by mandarins, governors and alcaldes\r\nmayores of the \"Chinese nation.\" The king signified his unwillingness\r\nto comply with their request at this time, and accordingly ordered\r\nthe governor and audiencia to permit no changes to be made. [510]\r\nOn July 27, 1713, the tribunal, acting in a legislative capacity,\r\ndecreed that within thirty days \"all Moros, Armenians, Malabars,\r\nChinese and other enemies of the Holy Faith\" should be lodged in the\r\nParián when visiting Manila, or when living there temporarily for\r\npurposes of visit or trade. Penalties were also prescribed for the\r\ninfraction of the above law. [511] This affords one illustration out\r\nof many which could be cited of the legislation of the audiencia in\r\nChinese affairs. [512]\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 1790, the king wrote to the \"governor and president\r\nof the royal audiencia\" and also to the tribunal, ordering the\r\nre-establishment of the Parián. This Chinese quarter had been abolished\r\nsince 1756. It was agreed that the Chinese in this district should be\r\nruled by an alcalde, who should also hear cases in first instance,\r\nwith appeal to the audiencia. It was furthermore decreed that the\r\nChinese population in the Islands should be fixed at 4000 and that each\r\nindividual should be taxed at the rate of six pesos per capita. [513]\r\nThis tax was to be collected by the cabecilla of the Chinese, a sort\r\nof local leader, subject to the alcalde of the Parián. This cédula,\r\nthe king stated, was originally suggested by the acuerdo of the\r\naudiencia, and had been submitted for royal approval, which had been\r\nduly conceded. This correspondence, which shows the real operation\r\nof the government much more accurately than the citation of laws\r\nalone could do, makes it quite clear that throughout the history of\r\nthe Islands, notwithstanding the existence of many cédulas to the\r\ncontrary, the audiencia exercised advisory power in regard to the\r\ngovernment of the Chinese. This authority was repeatedly recognized\r\nby the governor and by the king himself.\r\n\r\nAfter the inauguration of the superintendency of real hacienda\r\nat Manila in 1787, the incumbent of that office was made largely\r\nresponsible for the Chinese. This was probably so arranged because the\r\ncare and administration of the Chinese at that time involved questions\r\nof finance rather than of war and defense. It will be remembered,\r\ntoo, that, during much of the time, the office of superintendent was\r\ncombined with that of governor. A number of disputes arose between the\r\ngovernor and the intendant after the latter office was created in 1785,\r\n[514] but after the union of the governorship with the superintendency,\r\nno further occasion of dispute arose. During the greater part of the\r\nnineteenth century, the peculiar nature of the office of intendant\r\ngave to the latter official the duty of collecting the licenses of\r\nthe Chinese, subject to the superintendent.\r\n\r\nThere yet remains something to be said regarding the administration of\r\njustice among the Chinese, and we must note certain typical disputes\r\nand disagreements which arose in that connection. That the audiencia\r\nhad authority to try cases in second instance involving the Chinese\r\nhas already been stated. Likewise the oidores were liable to special\r\ndelegation to try cases of an extraordinary character which arose\r\namong the Chinese, as, for example in 1786, when Oidor Bolívar y\r\nMeña was designated to try in first instance charges which had been\r\nmade against Chinese bakers in the Parián, who were said to have\r\nput a quantity of powdered glass in bread which they had made for\r\nthe Spaniards. This case was regarded as one of more than ordinary\r\nsignificance, as involving treason and insurrection, and it was\r\naccordingly tried by an oidor who had been especially delegated for\r\nthe purpose by the governor. [515]\r\n\r\nThe question of Chinese jurisdiction is further illustrated by\r\na dispute which arose in the colony between the audiencia and the\r\ngovernor, and which was carried to the king by the latter functionary\r\non June 30, 1793. Oidor Moreno had ordered the arrest of the Chinese\r\ncabecilla of the Parián on a criminal charge. [516] The detention of\r\nthe Chinaman was conceded to be justifiable, but Governor Marquina\r\nalleged that Moreno had entirely disregarded the cédula of October\r\n11, 1784, which had ordered that in case of the arrest of any royal\r\nofficial, notification should be served to the governor in sufficient\r\ntime for him to take the proper precautions for the safeguarding of\r\nany of His Majesty's property which might be in the care or under the\r\nprotection of the official in question. He said that this particular\r\narrest was typical of the petty interference of the oidores and\r\nillustrative of the slight pretexts upon which they frequently upset\r\nthe whole system of government and caused untold annoyances. On account\r\nof the many difficulties in the collection of the tribute which had\r\npresented themselves as a consequence of the arrest of this particular\r\nChinese official, and because the latter was especially efficient,\r\nthe governor had asked the audiencia to permit the cabecilla to be\r\nexcused on condition that he should bind himself to return to the\r\ncustody of the audiencia after he had collected the taxes. This the\r\ntribunal had refused. The government, as a consequence, had been put to\r\nmuch inconvenience in finding a substitute, and the sum collected had\r\nbeen considerably less than was usually obtained, owing to the lack\r\nof experience of the new collector. After the cabecilla had been in\r\nprison over four months, he was brought to trial, and nothing being\r\nproved against him, he was freed. The audiencia, however, had won\r\nits point, and had manifested its right to the last word in judicial\r\naffairs relating to the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the appellate jurisdiction of the audiencia in\r\ncontentious cases involving Chinese and in administrative matters which\r\nit did not have is illustrated by a case which came up in 1794 and\r\nlasted through twelve years of litigation. In the year aforementioned,\r\nthe ayuntamiento of Manila brought suit before an alcalde ordinario\r\nof the city against a Chinese, Augustín Chagisco, on a charge of\r\nthe failure of the latter properly to fulfill a contract which he\r\nhad made to supply the city with meat. The alcalde ordinario, before\r\nwhom suit had been brought in first instance, cancelled the contract,\r\nand the Chinese appealed to the audiencia. The tribunal, after due\r\nconsideration of the case, restored Chagisco to his status as provider\r\nof meats (abastecedor de carne) for the city. Instead of appealing\r\nthe case as one of law, the ayuntamiento wrote to the king on January\r\n19, 1796, alleging that the audiencia had interfered in behalf of a\r\nChinese whose services the ayuntamiento had discontinued as provider\r\nof meats, over which matter the audiencia had no jurisdiction. The\r\nking immediately gave expression of his approval of the stand of the\r\nayuntamiento, being of the impression that the question at stake was\r\none of appointment only. [517] At the same time the king demanded\r\na full explanation from the oidores as to why they had interfered\r\nin this matter which was so far removed from their jurisdiction. The\r\naudiencia, in reply, sent all the records and testimonios of the suit\r\nto the Council, and that tribunal called upon the ayuntamiento in\r\ndue time to explain why it had misrepresented the case. After a long\r\nperiod of acrimonious correspondence between the Manila authorities,\r\nthe case was concluded on February 19, 1806, by a reversal of the\r\nearlier decision, and His Majesty sent a letter of congratulation\r\nand approval to the audiencia in appreciation of its stand in the\r\nmatter. [518] The king informed the tribunal that it had been entirely\r\nregular in its proceedings, having reversed the decision of the alcalde\r\nordinario in a legal suit which had been appealed by the Chinese to the\r\naudiencia in protest against the adverse decision of the lower court.\r\n\r\nWithout carrying this discussion further, it is clear that the\r\naudiencia had general appellate jurisdiction in cases involving the\r\nChinese. These cases, when they originated in the Parián, were tried\r\nin first instance by special judges for the Chinese, but suits brought\r\nagainst a Chinese who lived outside, or suits of a semi-public nature,\r\nas the one just noted, might be tried in first instance by the ordinary\r\njudges. It has also been noted that oidores were sometimes delegated\r\nto try cases in first instance involving treason or insurrection of\r\nChinese. In regard to matters of government, it may be said that\r\nthe governor was held responsible, but even in these the oidores\r\nparticipated in an advisory capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE AUDIENCIA AND THE GOVERNOR: CONFLICTS OF JURISDICTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be said that the relations of the governor and the\r\naudiencia were comparatively peaceful and harmonious throughout the\r\nhistory of the Philippines, there were many conflicts of jurisdiction\r\nand these struggles for power assume great prominence on account of\r\ntheir bitterness. An investigation of the principles underlying them\r\nand the arguments advanced by the contending parties will go far\r\ntowards explaining the relationship of the audiencia with the governor.\r\n\r\nCertain factors and conditions were always prevalent in the colony\r\nto cause trouble and provoke enmity between the governor and\r\nthe oidores. Chief among these were the rivalry between them for\r\ncommercial profits, jealously of power and advancement, and the\r\ndesire on the part of all, and particularly of the governors, to\r\nenrich themselves. Officials tended to regard their appointments\r\nas commissions to engage in profitable ventures and business\r\nundertakings--opportunities which were to be immediately improved. It\r\nis probable that the presence of the audiencia did more to check\r\nthis tendency than any other agency, for the documents bearing on\r\nthe history of the colony are replete with charges made by oidores\r\nand fiscales against governors. It is also true that the oidores\r\ndid effective work in correcting the misdeeds of the provincial\r\ngovernors and justices on their official tours of inspection. That the\r\naudiencia should accomplish this result was to be expected, since the\r\nleading purpose of its establishment was to check the excesses of the\r\ngovernor. The other side of the question cannot be neglected, however,\r\nfor charges were made in sufficient number against the oidores. It\r\nis with these charges and counter-charges, memorials, complaints,\r\nand arguments that the present chapter is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe method to be pursued in this chapter will be that of indicating\r\nin all fairness both sides of these conflicts, not with the purpose\r\nof seeing which side was right, but with the object of obtaining\r\nthe respective viewpoints of the governors and magistrates. We shall\r\nfirst consider evidence which was submitted in behalf of the audiencia\r\nagainst the governor, and in turn, that of the governors against the\r\noidores. This method of procedure is the only one feasible since the\r\nmaterials here utilized consist mostly of arguments for or against\r\nthe governor or audiencia, respectively.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the first notorious disagreement in the\r\ncolony arose between Bishop Salazar and Governors Ronquillo de Peñalosa\r\nand Santiago de Vera. This occurred before the establishment of the\r\naudiencia. The audiencia was in fact established partly to have an\r\nimpartial tribunal present to arbitrate such disputes, and partly to\r\ncheck the excesses of the governor. [519] We have also given attention\r\nto the charges made by Oidor Dávalos against his fellow-magistrates\r\nand the governor shortly after the audiencia was established. It has\r\nbeen noted that the incessant quarreling between the governor and\r\nthe audiencia from 1584 to 1589 was one of the causes for abolishing\r\nthe tribunal at the latter date. From 1590 to 1595 the governor was\r\nsupreme in matters of government, war, and justice. It was clearly\r\nshown during this period that the discord of a quarrelsome tribunal\r\nwas eminently to be preferred to the unchecked abuses of an autocratic\r\ngovernor. In 1595 the audiencia was re-established by royal enactment;\r\nfrom that date onward it became a permanent part of the government,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that its relations with the other institutions\r\nof the colony were not harmonious.\r\n\r\nThere were two complaints most frequently made against governors. One\r\nof these was their commercial excesses and the other, their abuse\r\nof the power of appointment. The former consisted of the monopoly\r\nof galleon space for themselves, or their friends, the acceptance\r\nof bribes from merchants for various favors, or the manipulation of\r\nthe Chinese trade in some way for their own advantage. The tendency\r\nof governors to appoint their friends and relatives to office,\r\nnotwithstanding the royal prohibition, and the apparent inability of\r\nthe audiencia to prevent this was a source of complaint, especially\r\nduring the early years of the colony. [520] Dishonest proceedings in\r\nthe sale of offices, including the retention of the money received and\r\nthe disposal of offices to friends for nominal sums, were among the\r\nirregularities of the early governors. These abuses the magistrates\r\noften knowingly permitted in return for some favor allowed them\r\nby the governor. That the laws which forbade these abuses of the\r\npower of appointment had been openly and flagrantly violated was\r\na charge brought up repeatedly in the residencias of governors and\r\nmagistrates. An examination of the correspondence of the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries would almost lead to the belief that the\r\nhome government despaired of ever righting these wrongs, and left\r\nthem unpunished, rather directing efforts towards reform in other\r\nchannels in the hope of remedying greater defects.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no governor more flagrantly disregarded the audiencia\r\nand the royal authority which it represented, or more frequently\r\nlaid himself open to complaints on account of his violent conduct\r\nthan Alonso Fajardo, who ruled from 1618 to 1624. Numerous charges\r\nwere brought against him by the audiencia, some of which concerned\r\nitself, and some had to do with the general administration of the\r\ngovernment. It was charged that Fajardo sought to usurp the judicial\r\nfunctions of the tribunal, and to assume control of the administration\r\nof justice. He had on one occasion broken up a session of the court\r\nduring the trial of a certain person for murder, ordering a sergeant\r\nto take him out and hang him. Fajardo defended himself against this\r\naccusation by alleging that the criminal was a sailor from the royal\r\nfleet, whom he, as captain-general, had already condemned, and that\r\nthe audiencia was acting illegally in entertaining the case. Fajardo\r\nwas said to have released prisoners at his own pleasure, and to have\r\nabused the pardoning power. He had made threats of violence against\r\nthe magistrates in the court-room.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia not only complained against this governor's interference\r\nwith the exercise of its functions as a court, but it manifested a\r\nwider interest than the purely judicial by complaining against the\r\nexcesses of the governor in his own administrative field. The charge\r\nwas made that Fajardo had bought up due-bills and treasury certificates\r\nfrom the soldiers and other creditors of the government, at less than\r\ntheir face value, and had presented them to the oficiales reales,\r\nrealizing the full amount on them, and retaining the proceeds. He\r\nwas charged with exacting large sums from the Chinese in exchange for\r\ntrading privileges, retaining the money himself instead of putting it\r\ninto the treasury. He was said to have forced loans from the merchants\r\nin order to make up financial deficits, and to have taken money out of\r\nthe treasury, secretly, at night. Another charge brought against him\r\nwas that of allowing favorites to go out and meet the incoming ships\r\nof the Chinese, thereby obtaining for himself and for them the choice\r\nparts of the cargoes in advance of the merchants of Manila. [521]\r\nThere is no evidence that the tribunal was able to put a stop to\r\nthese abuses.\r\n\r\nOidor Álvaro Messa y Lugo, in a letter written to the king on July 20,\r\n1622, continued the campaign which had been started by the audiencia\r\nagainst this governor. He claimed that Fajardo had sought to prevent\r\nofficials and private citizens from sending complaints to Spain against\r\nhim by examining all the outgoing mail before it left the colony. The\r\noidor showed that wastefulness, private trade, bribery, carelessness\r\nin the administration of the exchequer, neglect of shipbuilding,\r\ncorruption, and personal violence were among the misdeeds of this\r\ngovernor. Messa reported that he had tried unsuccessfully to authorize\r\nthe auditing of the accounts of the galleon for two successive years,\r\nin accordance with the royal instructions which ordered that it\r\nshould be done at the termination of each voyage by the fiscal and\r\ntwo oidores. [522] Messa said that the governor feared to have the\r\ncolony's finances examined for it was well known that they were in\r\na deplorable state.\r\n\r\nOne instance of the governor's financial ingenuity which was given\r\nby Messa, illustrates the limitations placed by the audiencia on the\r\ngovernor's appointing power. The audiencia relieved the secretary of\r\ngovernment, Pedro Muñoz, of his office upon the expiration of his\r\nterm, selling the place to Diego de Rueda for 8000 pesos. Fajardo\r\ndispossessed Rueda and restored the office to its former incumbent\r\nfor 1500 pesos. The audiencia's action in disposing of this office\r\nwithout the consent of the governor was justified by a law promulgated\r\non November 13, 1581, ordering that offices should be bestowed only\r\nupon persons of such qualities and attributes as met with the approval\r\nof the royal justices. [523] The governor emerged triumphant in this\r\ncontest, however, because it was generally recognized at that time\r\nthat his word should be final in matters of appointment. Although\r\nwe have seen in a former chapter that the governor consulted with\r\nthe audiencia when an important appointment was to be made, the\r\naudiencia's intervention in matters of appointment depended largely\r\non the strength of the tribunal and the relations existing between\r\nit and the governor. During this administration the audiencia was\r\nnotoriously weak and harmony did not exist.\r\n\r\nThe memorial presented by Messa y Lugo was chiefly concerned with the\r\nstory of his own arbitrary arrest and imprisonment at the instigation\r\nof Fajardo on trumped-up charges, as he alleged. The judicial inquiry\r\nlasted two months, and it furnishes an excellent example of the power\r\nof a governor over a weak audiencia. The occasion for the investigation\r\nhad been a disagreement between the governor and the oidor over\r\nthe latter's claim to act as administrator of the property of Oidor\r\nAlcaraz, who had died in office. The governor, by the appointment\r\nof a magistrate favorable to himself as juez de difuntos, had hoped\r\nto control the administration of the property, since Messa was under\r\nsentence of residencia, and the remaining magistrates of the audiencia\r\nwere favorable to him. Moreover, Fajardo wished to forestall certain\r\ncharges of misgovernment which he knew that Messa was prepared to\r\nmake against him. Consequently the governor designated an alcalde of\r\nthe city to conduct the residencia. Messa was given practically no\r\nopportunity to defend himself. His property was sequestrated, even\r\nto his wife's clothing. Seeing that he could not obtain justice,\r\nhe escaped from prison and took refuge in a Dominican convent.\r\n\r\nMessa, from the seclusion of the monastery, challenged the legality of\r\nthe governor's procedure. According to his contention, the previous\r\nlaw authorizing the governor to name an alcalde ordinario to try\r\nan oidor, was now a dead-letter. Its chief defect had been that an\r\nalcalde, who was the creature of the governor, would always aim to\r\nrender a decision pleasing to his master. He urged that the law\r\nthen in force authorized the governor to proceed with the trial\r\nof an oidor, only upon consulting the audiencia, and moreover that\r\nresulting condemnations, if they were personal or corporal, should be\r\nconfirmed by the Council of the Indies. [524] Messa therefore claimed\r\nthat the governor had no authority to proceed with this case alone,\r\nsince \"those nearest (your Majesty), as are the auditors (oidores),\r\ncannot be imprisoned or proceeded against except by your Majesty or\r\nthe royal Council, or by your order.\"\r\n\r\nThe oidor then proceeded to show the extent to which, in his opinion,\r\nthe governor might intervene in the sessions and proceedings of the\r\naudiencia. He wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The president, in virtue of his superintendency over the Audiencia,\r\n    may ordain to the auditors what may be the just and reasonable\r\n    in matters that pertain to the government and its conservation;\r\n    and even, in the heated arguments that are wont to arise between\r\n    the auditors, has authority, in case the nature of the affair\r\n    might require it, to retire each auditor to his own house, until\r\n    they make up the quarrel; and, should he deem it advisable,\r\n    he may inform your Majesty. For the ordinance does not say that\r\n    the president and alcaldes shall proceed, arrest, sentence and\r\n    execute justice in criminal cases affecting the auditors. [525]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the interpretation which Messa placed upon the law giving\r\nauthority over the trial of magistrates of the audiencia to the\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nMessa then proceeded to discuss other matters relative to the\r\nrespective spheres of the governor and audiencia. The governor had\r\nbroken open the chest of the audiencia, extracting a large sum and\r\nspending it without accounting for the expenditure, and without\r\nany beneficial results. He was guilty of four murders, one of his\r\nvictims being his wife. The audiencia should be empowered to try him\r\nfor these crimes, but it lacked jurisdiction. During his term Fajardo\r\nhad exercised such absolute power that justice had been paralyzed and\r\nlitigants were holding back their suits from trial because justice\r\ncould not be obtained in the audiencia. The governor had sent from\r\nthe Islands more than a million pesos in goods and money, all of\r\nwhich he had obtained through fraudulent and illegitimate means.\r\n\r\nThe governor had quarreled finally with the oidores who had remained\r\nfaithful to him; one of these had become incapacitated through\r\nsickness, while the other had taken refuge in a Jesuit convent. The\r\naudiencia was thus dissolved. The governor, feeling the need of\r\na tribunal, withdrew the charges against Messa, and ordered the\r\nlatter to come back and resume his office. The oidor complied, but his\r\nhostility toward the governor had in no way abated. Messa concluded his\r\nmemorial with the request that a visitor should be sent to the colony\r\nto investigate the charges which had been made against the governor,\r\nand at the same time to restore the audiencia to its rightful position\r\nin the colony. He stated his conviction that the office of governor\r\nshould be abolished, and that the audiencia should be empowered to\r\nact in his place. This belief he justified by the statement that the\r\naudiencia had already successfully acted in the capacity of governor\r\nand had administered affairs with great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe power which the governor had of imprisoning and chastising\r\nmagistrates of the audiencia who dared to oppose him, enabled him to\r\nemerge victorious in his struggles with that body. He was even able\r\nto completely suppress the audiencia. Nevertheless he was obliged,\r\nthrough the need of the tribunal which he had vanquished, to restore\r\nit again, although it was opposed to him. In no less than three cases\r\ngovernors, in order to comply with the law requiring that there should\r\nbe at least one oidor of royal appointment, were obliged to restore to\r\nthe audiencia magistrates who had formerly been under arrest. Being in\r\npossession of all the powers of an executive, the governor was usually\r\nable to reduce the audiencia to subserviency, unless the dispositions\r\nof the opposing oidores were such that they would not submit. On\r\nthe whole, the audiencia seemed unable to check the excesses of the\r\ngovernor, by virtue of its authority, and the oidores were obliged\r\nto confine themselves to protests and appeals to the king; these,\r\nonly after years of delay, effected the removal or punishment of the\r\ngovernor and the appointment of another to continue his excesses.\r\n\r\nThe complaints which Messa made on this occasion resulted in bringing\r\nto the Islands a visitor who conducted a lengthy, though somewhat\r\ntardy, investigation. Fajardo was already beyond the punishment of\r\nearthy kings and tribunals. But his property was seized and his\r\nheirs were fined; aside, however, from the removal of various of\r\nFajardo's subordinates, the government was but little better for the\r\nprotestations and appeals made by the audiencia. The oidores, instead\r\nof obtaining the desired reform measures, were usually rewarded for\r\nopposing a tyrannical governor and appealing to the court for support,\r\nby a reprimand for quarreling and an admonition to be quiet and\r\npeaceful, to preserve harmony, to attend strictly to their own affairs,\r\nand to abstain from interference with the government. Indeed, judging\r\nfrom the many similar replies which the oidores received in answer to\r\ntheir charges against governors, it appears that the preservation of\r\nharmonious relations between the officials of the colony was much more\r\nimportant than good government. Usually, however, in these struggles\r\nbetween the audiencia and the governor the contentions of one side\r\nor the other were based on law and justice. The effectiveness of\r\nthe Spanish colonial government would have been greatly increased\r\nhad the Council of the Indies taken advantage of these opportunities\r\nto investigate the principles at stake and support the right side,\r\nrather than by issuing impotent injunctions and remonstrances.\r\n\r\nThe most significant controversy which ever occurred in the Philippines\r\nbetween the governor and the audiencia arose in connection with the\r\nbanishment of Archbishop Pardo in 1683. It is not the purpose here\r\nto give a detailed account of the Pardo controversy, which will be\r\ndiscussed again in connection with the relations of the audiencia and\r\nthe church. However, since this episode involves certain incidents\r\nillustrating important phases of the relationship of the governor and\r\nthe audiencia, it is desirable to refer to it here in considerable\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThe real occasion for this conflict was the defiance of the laws of\r\nthe royal ecclesiastical patronage by the archbishop, who insisted on\r\nmaking ecclesiastical appointments without consulting the governor. The\r\ngovernor appealed to the audiencia for support, and the tribunal\r\nexercised jurisdiction over the case on the basis of its right to try\r\ncases of fuerza and to prevent ecclesiastical judges from infringing on\r\nthe civil jurisdiction. Juan Sánchez, the secretary of the audiencia,\r\nrelates that, owing to the interference of the Dominicans and Jesuits,\r\nand their harsh public criticism from the pulpit of the audiencia and\r\ngovernment, \"the royal Audiencia felt obliged to advise its president,\r\nthen Don Juan de Vargas, that he should apply a corrective to these\r\nacts.\" [526] This corrective was the banishment to Spain of certain\r\nindividuals of the Dominican order to answer for their misdeeds\r\nand ultimately the exile of Archbishop Pardo from the city. It is\r\nenough to say that Governor Juan de Vargas Hurtado and the audiencia\r\nacted in harmony on this occasion, presenting a solid front to the\r\necclesiastical power. When the new governor, Curuzaelegui, arrived,\r\nhowever, he forced the audiencia to ask pardon and absolution from\r\nthe archbishop, which the magistrates did on their knees. The new\r\ngovernor disgraced Vargas in the residencia, waiving for a time\r\nthe residencias of the oidores. Pardo was recalled from exile, and\r\nthe audiencia was forced to legalize his restoration to his see on\r\nOctober 25, 1684. Thus the new governor and the archbishop triumphed\r\nover the combined forces of the ex-governor and the audiencia.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the power of the new governor was derived chiefly\r\nfrom his status as royal vicepatron, acting in conjunction with the\r\narchbishop. This power Vargas had formerly employed in co-operation\r\nwith the audiencia, and thereby both had gained their victory over\r\nthe prelate before the arrival of the new governor. Curuzaelegui used\r\nthe same authority to recall Pardo; and in so doing he was probably\r\nthe only governor in the history of the Islands who ever supported\r\na prelate against the advice of the audiencia. The combination of\r\na governor and an audiencia was much more frequent, as we shall\r\nsee. The position of the governor was strengthened, also, by his\r\ncommission to conduct the residencia of Vargas, and the respect\r\nwhich the audiencia had for him was increased by the fact that in\r\njudging the ex-governor's misdeeds he was also authorized to hold\r\nthe oidores responsible for all their official opinions and acts\r\nin acuerdo with the disgraced governor. [527] Another source of the\r\ngovernor's strength was to be found in the royal instructions which\r\nhe carried with him to stop the quarrels previously existing in the\r\ncolony. The oidores very prudently submitted to the new governor,\r\nand therefore, for a time, they were patronized by the latter, who\r\nutilized their intimate knowledge of local affairs to aid him in\r\nobtaining control of the government and familiarizing himself with\r\nit. Meanwhile he literally held the residencia over their heads.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the new governor toward the audiencia during the first\r\nsix months may be described as conciliatory. That he did not act with\r\nentire independence of it is attested by the fact that when Vargas\r\nappealed to the tribunal against the ecclesiastical penalties imposed\r\nby the archbishop, the governor signed the act ordering the absolution\r\nof his predecessor. When the archbishop persisted in his intention\r\nto humiliate Vargas on the ground that the Inquisition demanded such\r\naction, the new governor threatened again to expel the prelate if\r\nhe did not desist. [528] His pacificatory efforts also resulted in a\r\ntemporary cessation of the hostility between the archbishop and the\r\naudiencia; he held private conferences with the oidores, manifesting\r\nrepeatedly his determination to proceed harmoniously with them. As\r\na result of this treatment, the magistrates were emboldened to urge\r\nthat the return of the prelate was contrary to law, and inconsistent\r\nwith all precedent.\r\n\r\nFinally, unable to resist the pressure exerted by the archbishop,\r\nand obtaining advance information of the royal condemnation of the\r\naudiencia for its acts in the banishment of Pardo, the governor\r\narrested, imprisoned, and exiled the magistrates, temporarily\r\nreconstituting the tribunal with local and more subservient\r\nmembers. [529] Curuzaelegui's proceedings were thenceforth as\r\nhigh-handed as they had formerly been conciliatory, and from that\r\ntime onward the residents of the colony were subjected to the rule\r\nof an absolute governor, aided by an unscrupulous and vindictive\r\nprelate and a subservient audiencia. Just before his imprisonment,\r\nMagistrate Bolívar, in a letter to the Minister of the Indies,\r\ndescribed the chaos existent in Manila as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here there is no will, save that of a governor, since he is\r\n    absolute, we all had to acquiesce, under compulsion and pressure,\r\n    in the restitution of the archbishop; [530] ... to state the\r\n    case in few words, the archbishop does whatever suits his whim,\r\n    without there being anyone to restrain him. [531]\r\n\r\n\r\nFray Luís Pimentel, a Jesuit, in a letter which he wrote to a friend,\r\nstated that the arrest of the oidores by the governor had been inspired\r\nby personal spite and a desire for revenge. He had desired to punish\r\nmagistrates Viga and Bolívar, particularly for their opposition to him\r\nin matters of administration and in his trading-schemes. The governor\r\nwas also said to have been actuated by a suspicion that these oidores\r\nhad formulated elaborate charges of misgovernment against him, and\r\nhe desired to prevent these complaints from reaching the king. [532]\r\n\r\nPimentel proceeded to relate that the governor then found himself\r\nembarrassed without the aid of an audiencia, and had accordingly\r\nformed another of his own selection. This body was careful to execute\r\nthe governor's will in every particular; consequently there was no\r\ncheck on his misrule. This new audiencia approved all the acts of\r\nthe archbishop and refused to entertain the appeals of the ex-governor,\r\n\r\n\r\n    royal decrees were despatched against the preachers (Jesuits)\r\n    who zealously proclaimed from the pulpits the arbitrary and\r\n    malicious character of the recent acts, and the Dominicans alone\r\n    had the privilege to utter whatever absurdities they pleased in\r\n    the pulpits.... No authentic statement of the evil deeds of these\r\n    years can be sent to the court for the scriveners are intimidated\r\n    and will not give official statements of what occurs, except\r\n    what may be in favor of the governor and the archbishop. Item,\r\n    (this) is written in much distrust and fear, on account of the\r\n    numerous spies who go about prying into and noting everything\r\n    that is done. [533]\r\n\r\n\r\nPimentel stated that the archbishop, who was a Dominican, had used\r\nthis rupture between the governor and the audiencia, and the favor of\r\nthe governor, particularly, as an occasion and pretext for imposing\r\non the Jesuits and Franciscans. He had deprived them of their lands\r\nand parishes, and had obtained many favors for the Dominicans and\r\nAugustinians at the expense of the rival orders. \"It seems as if\r\nthe governor had come to the islands,\" Pimentel wrote, \"for nothing\r\nelse than to encourage the Dominicans in their rebellious acts, to\r\ntrample on the laws, to abolish recourse to the royal Audiencia, to\r\nsow dissension, to be a tyrant, to disturb the peace, and to enable\r\nthe archbishop to secure whatever he wishes, even though he imposes\r\nso grievous a captivity on the commonwealth.\" [534]\r\n\r\nThe Pardo controversy and its consequences show the extremes to which\r\na weakened audiencia was reduced on occasion by a new governor who\r\ncame to the Islands, armed with recent royal decrees instructing\r\nhim to bring about peace and order. Curuzaelegui, assisted by the\r\nroyal visitor, who bore instructions even more recent than those\r\nof the governor, imprisoned and exiled the oidores, confiscated\r\ntheir property and brought about their ruination and death. He\r\nthen appointed another audiencia of his own choice. All these acts\r\nwere strictly legal, and in accordance with his instructions. The\r\ngovernor's conduct before the appointment of the visitor was more\r\nlenient and tolerant than afterwards. This shows that he realized the\r\nnecessity of fulfilling the royal will, the policies of which were\r\nentrusted to Valdivia for execution, even at the expense of harmony\r\nwith the local tribunal. Had he not been assured of the support of\r\nthe church on the one hand, and of the royal approval on the other,\r\nas shown by the commission of Valdivia, it is improbable that he\r\nwould have broken with the audiencia, or would have attempted to use\r\nhis power so extensively. The presence of an audiencia was necessary\r\nto the government of Curuzaelegui. This is shown by his conciliatory\r\nattitude toward the tribunal of Vargas, until he knew that it was\r\nunder the condemnation of the king, also by his own act in forming\r\na new one. This controversy clearly illustrates the extent to which\r\na governor might use his power, and it shows, on the other hand,\r\nthe indispensable character of the audiencia, even at a time when it\r\nwas least powerful. Curuzaelegui, in the name of the king, completely\r\nobliterated the legally constituted audiencia, appointing another to\r\nserve until it could be legalized by regular appointment.\r\n\r\nChronologically speaking, the next great struggle which throws\r\nlight on the subject which we are considering, occurred during the\r\nadministration of Governor Bustamante (1717-1719). The audiencia was\r\nreduced to a deplorable state of helplessness and inefficiency on\r\nthis occasion, and the circumstances surrounding its relationship\r\nwith the governor were in many ways similar to those which have\r\nbeen described. For a period of two and a half years antecedent\r\nto the coming of Bustamante, the government of the Philippines had\r\nbeen nominally in the hands of the audiencia, but in reality, under\r\nthe control of the senior magistrate, Torralba. One of the first\r\nacts of Bustamante, after his arrival in the Islands, was to take\r\nthe residencia of Torralba, and this investigation led him to make\r\nserious charges against the other magistrates. In the residencia which\r\nfollowed, the finances of the colony were found to be in bad condition,\r\nand all the officials of the civil government, as well as many of\r\nthe churchmen, were discovered to be deeply interested in private\r\ntrade, to the neglect of their duties and to the detriment of the\r\ngovernment. Large amounts of money were found to have been smuggled\r\nwithout permission into the colony on the galleon from Mexico. The\r\naccounts of the treasury department were discovered to have been\r\nloosely kept, and many of the officials, including magistrates of the\r\naudiencia, were found to be serving without financial guarantees. [535]\r\n\r\nBustamante immediately took steps to re-organize the government and\r\nto place the finances of the colony on a sound footing. He put a stop\r\nto the smuggling, forced the merchants to pay the authorized duties,\r\nand imposed fines on those who had been guilty of negligence and\r\nmisconduct. At the end of six months the efforts of Bustamante had\r\nnetted a sum of 293,000 pesos to the royal treasury. His successful\r\nefforts towards clearing up the finances of the colony, making\r\nevery person pay his just dues without regard to position, rank,\r\nor affiliation, and the seeming harshness of his methods incurred\r\ngeneral hostility and contributed largely to his downfall. [536]\r\n\r\nHis investigation of the finances was said to have revealed a\r\nshortage of over 700,000 pesos, for which he held Torralba and the\r\nother magistrates responsible, putting, most of the blame, however, on\r\nTorralba. All but one of the magistrates were arrested and incarcerated\r\nin Fort Santiago. Before this was done, however, Bustamante asked\r\nthe advice of the archbishop, the religious corporations, and the\r\nuniversities, as to what steps he should take in the matter. He\r\nrecognized that he would be seriously embarrassed without an audiencia,\r\nbut the investigations which he had made showed that all of the oidores\r\nwere guilty of misappropriation of the government funds. Would he\r\nbe justified in forming an audiencia of his own selection, composed\r\nof duly qualified lawyers, with one minister of royal designation\r\nremaining? It was his opinion that the presence of one regularly\r\nappointed magistrate would lend legality to the entire tribunal, so he\r\nasked advice as to which of the three oidores would be most suitable to\r\nretain. He cited as a precedent in favor of his reconstitution of the\r\naudiencia the action of Governor Curuzaelegui in 1687 and 1688 when he\r\nexiled and imprisoned the oidores and reformed the audiencia with his\r\nown appointees. Bustamante proposed to do exactly what Curuzaelegui had\r\ndone, that is, to act as president himself, appointing the fiscal as\r\noidor, and designating a duly qualified lawyer and an assistant fiscal\r\nto fill the other vacant places. Bustamante expressed an apparently\r\nsincere desire to do justice to all. He desired, particularly, that the\r\nadministration of justice in the courts should be allowed to proceed\r\nwithout interruption and without that loss to the commonwealth which\r\nwould come from the absence of a tribunal. [537]\r\n\r\nThe replies given by the orders on this occasion involve important\r\nlaws and principles which underlie the nature of the audiencia and its\r\nrelation to the governorship. The archbishop, in a subsequent report to\r\nthe king on the government of Bustamante, stated that all the religious\r\nauthorities in the colony advised the governor against the destruction\r\nof the audiencia, and questioned the authority of the prelate to\r\nconstitute another. [538] It seems, however, from an investigation\r\nof the letters, that the Jesuits counseled the governor in favor of\r\nthe proposed action. The reasoning of the Jesuit theologians was as\r\nfollows: there should be retained in the Philippines, according to\r\nthe Recopilación de Indias, [539] four oidores and a fiscal for the\r\nproper administration of justice, and if the fiscal were the only\r\nremaining member of the old audiencia he would become an oidor in\r\ncase of a vacancy, by virtue of the recognized law. [540] Owing to\r\nthe multitudinous duties of the oidores and to the great importance\r\nof the audiencia, great harm would arise if there were not enough\r\nmagistrates. Since the governor's jurisdiction extended to all\r\ndepartments of government, it was the opinion of the Jesuits that\r\nit was incumbent on him to take such steps as might seem necessary\r\nfor the preservation of the government. This was specially imperative\r\nsince it was his duty to see that there was no delay or neglect in the\r\nadministration of justice. Inasmuch as the audiencia was indispensable\r\nto him as vicepatron in its jurisdiction over ecclesiastical affairs,\r\nand because of its consultative powers in all affairs of government\r\nand finance, the governor should have the right to create an audiencia,\r\nif one did not exist, or if the members who were regularly constituted\r\nby royal appointment were incapacitated from service. [541]\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the Dominicans of the University of Santo Tomás differed\r\nwidely from that advanced by the Jesuits. Their advice coincided\r\nwith that of the archbishop, being to the effect that it would not be\r\nconvenient to qualify one of the ministers alone, but that all of them\r\nshould be restored to the audiencia. This meant that Bustamante should\r\nrecede from his position, remove all the oidores from prison, and\r\naccept them as an audiencia. If the three oidores deserved punishment\r\nit would be unfair to the remaining two magistrates to exempt one,\r\nand such action would lay the governor open to charges of inconsistency\r\nand favoritism. The Dominicans contended that only the king in council\r\ncould suspend or remove oidores, and that such power was not given\r\nto any other authority, not even to a viceroy. [542] Though\r\n\r\n\r\n    in Sicily and Naples this right is granted, in the Indies the\r\n    contrary is true, because only the king that appointed them may\r\n    suspend them, and it is commanded that the viceroys must not\r\n    interfere with or impede their jurisdiction. [543]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dominicans were of the opinion that the governor had authority\r\nto discipline the oidores, but in so doing he could not go so far\r\nas to remove them from the tribunal unless commanded to do so by\r\nthe Council of the Indies. Whatever disciplinary action the governor\r\nmight decide on, it should not be taken on his own authority, but in\r\nthe execution of the orders of the Council of the Indies.\r\n\r\nThis opinion, the Dominicans alleged, was in accordance with the laws\r\nof the Indies. [544] They cited, in support of their argument, an\r\ninstance in which the king reproved Gálvez, the Viceroy of New Spain,\r\nbecause, without the authority of the Council, Gálvez had suspended a\r\nmagistrate of the Audiencia of Mexico, whom he should have honored and\r\nto \"whom he should have accorded the treatment of a colleague.\" [545]\r\nThe Dominicans expressed the opinion that the prosperity of the\r\nIslands and the welfare of the government depended on the audiencia,\r\nand though it might be desirable to remove the oidores for personal\r\nguilt, it could not be done in this case without wrecking the entire\r\ngovernment. The king, himself, had shown respect for the inviolability\r\nof the audiencia when, in 1710, he had judged all the ministers to be\r\nequally guilty of not having fulfilled the laws and ordinances on the\r\noccasion of the coming to the Islands of the Patriarch of Antioch,\r\n[546] satisfying himself with the removal of the decano only and\r\nallowing the other magistrates to remain.\r\n\r\nDisregarding the advice of this learned body, turning a deaf ear to\r\nthe protestations of the archbishop, and heeding only the counsel\r\nof the Jesuits, which was more favorable to his wishes, Bustamante\r\nproceeded to execute his own will in a manner which proved distasteful\r\neven to the order whose advice he was following. [547] He arrested\r\nand imprisoned the guilty magistrates and created a new tribunal\r\nout of his own clientele, leaving only Villa, a former magistrate,\r\nin office. The latter protested against the action of the governor,\r\nand retired to the convent of Guadalupe, near Pásig. Informed that\r\nthere was a conspiracy against his life and needing the counsel of some\r\nperson, or persons, on whom he could rely, Bustamante was well-nigh\r\ndesperate. His government, as it then stood, lacked the complexity of\r\nlegality which the presence of one oidor of royal nomination would\r\nhave given it. In order to remedy this defect he released Torralba,\r\nthe guiltiest of the former magistrates, and the man under arrest for\r\nthe defalcation of 700,000 pesos of the king's revenue. Torralba's\r\ncrimes had been notorious, and the act of Bustamante in associating\r\nhimself with a person of the unsavory reputation and the unpopularity\r\nof Torralba not only divorced him from whatever popular sympathy he\r\nmight have had among the residents of the colony, but it aroused the\r\nhostility and antagonism of the Jesuits who had been heretofore the\r\ngovernor's friends. Aside from the unfortunate character of the act,\r\nit was also illegal, being contrary to the law which directed that in\r\ncase an oidor were suspended from his place he should not be restored\r\nwithout the consent of the king and the Council of the Indies. [548]\r\n\r\nThe newly constituted audiencia busied itself at once with the task\r\nof government. Archbishop de la Cuesta, among others, questioned the\r\nlegality of the tribunal's opposition to the excommunication of its\r\nmembers. He was arrested by the governor, and then arose the contest\r\nwhich culminated in the murder of Bustamante, in the suppression of\r\nhis audiencia and in the first officially recognized government by a\r\nprelate in the Philippines. The archbishop reappointed all the former\r\nmagistrates to office, with the exception of Torralba, and the misdeeds\r\nof the government of Bustamante were saddled upon the ex-magistrate.\r\n\r\nTwo noteworthy considerations stand out prominently in connection\r\nwith this struggle; first, the influence of the governor over the\r\naudiencia, and his power to deprive regularly appointed magistrates\r\nof their positions and to constitute a new audiencia if he chose,\r\nnotwithstanding the prohibition of the laws, and, second, the complete\r\ncontrol by a governor over an audiencia which he had created. It is\r\nnot necessary to state that the Madrid government discredited all\r\nthe later acts of Bustamante's administration, including the recall\r\nof Torralba, who was a self-confessed criminal under arrest, when\r\nrestored by the governor. There is nothing to show, however, that the\r\nking disapproved of the acts of Bustamante in creating a new audiencia,\r\nunless it were the royal approval of Cuesta's act of reconstituting\r\nthe old tribunal. Torralba, in his residencia, was made to suffer for\r\nall the misdeeds of his government (in reality that of the audiencia,\r\nTorralba being decano, 1715-1717), as well as for those of Bustamante\r\n(1717-1719).\r\n\r\nThe audiencia, after it had been reconstituted by the\r\narchbishop-governor, neglected to investigate the causes of the\r\ngovernor's death, alleging as a reason that\r\n\r\n\r\n    this proceeding will greatly disturb the community; that to\r\n    proceed against these persons will be to cast odium on and grieve\r\n    nearly all the citizens, since the commotion was so general;\r\n    that all those who went out on that occasion did so \"in defense\r\n    of the ecclesiastical immunity, the preservation of this city,\r\n    the self-defense of its inhabitants, and the reputation of the\r\n    [Spanish] nation;\" and that to carry out this plan would be likely\r\n    to cause some disturbance of the public peace. [549]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a word, the influence of the archbishop was sufficient to keep\r\nthe audiencia from undertaking a formal investigation of the causes\r\nof the governor's death. It was quite generally recognized that the\r\nmurder had been committed in the interests of the prelate, probably\r\nby an assassin who had been in his pay, or in that of his friends,\r\nthe Jesuits. This is another illustration of the subserviency of\r\nthe audiencia to the governing power, on this occasion a churchman,\r\nwho had actively participated in the removal of his predecessor.\r\n\r\nAn interesting though ineffective protest was made by the audiencia\r\nagainst the appointment of José Basco y Vargas as Governor of the\r\nPhilippines in 1778. A communication was sent to the court describing\r\nthe abject state into which the king had degraded the audiencia by\r\nsubordinating it to a man whose title and rank as Captain of Frigate\r\ngave him only the right to be addressed as You, while each of the\r\nmagistrates enjoyed the title of Lordship. The Council rejected the\r\ncomplaint as an absurdity, after which certain oidores conspired\r\nto bring charges against Basco y Vargas, to arrest him and to make\r\nSarrio governor. The latter had been ad interim governor after the\r\ndeath of Anda, and he was at that time the beneficiary of the title and\r\nposition of segundo cabo, or second in command of the king's forces in\r\nthe Islands. Sarrio refused to join the magistrates in their revolt\r\nagainst the governor. Basco y Vargas was informed of their treason,\r\nand it is significant that he complied with the royal laws, not\r\nby attempting to punish the offenders himself, but by sending the\r\nrecalcitrant magistrates to Spain where they were dealt with by the\r\nCouncil of the Indies. [550]\r\n\r\nThis was only a prelude to the discord which existed throughout the\r\nadministration of this able governor. The king was obliged to issue\r\nspecial cédulas on various occasions, ordering a cessation of the\r\nperpetual discord. [551] Basco y Vargas formed a society for the\r\nadvancement of the economic interests of the Islands, [552] and in\r\nthat, as well as in his successful organization of the profitable\r\ntobacco monopoly, he was opposed by the audiencia. The tribunal claimed\r\nthat the governor was limiting its sphere of authority in inaugurating\r\nthese reforms. [553] Basco y Vargas recommended and brought about the\r\nseparation of the superintendency of real hacienda from the rest of\r\nthe government. This the audiencia also opposed, but in the contest\r\nover jurisdiction which ensued between the governor and the intendant,\r\nthe governor and the audiencia acted in complete harmony, because this\r\nnew official threatened their mutual interests and prerogatives. [554]\r\n\r\nOutlawry and highway robbery became so common throughout the Islands\r\nduring the term of Basco y Vargas that the governor appointed\r\nprosecutors, sheriffs, and judges-extraordinary to assist in the\r\npreservation of order, which the alcaldes mayores were not able\r\nto accomplish by themselves. The audiencia, feeling that this was\r\na grave intrusion upon its prerogatives, appealed to the king and\r\nsucceeded in bringing the sovereign displeasure upon the head of\r\nthe governor. The royal cédula stated that there was no need of\r\nthese additional officials. The judicial machinery which had been\r\nprovided for the Philippines from the beginning was sufficient. The\r\ngovernor was warned, furthermore, to abstain from meddling with the\r\njurisdiction of the audiencia. [555] This case confirms the statement\r\nalready made in this treatise that during this period and, in fact,\r\nafter the establishment of the regency in 1776, the governor exercised\r\na diminished authority in judicial affairs. When Basco y Vargas took\r\nhis office as governor of the Philippine Islands, he was obliged to\r\nsubscribe to two oaths, one as governor, and the other as president\r\nof the audiencia, but he was warned by a special decree of the king\r\nto keep from confusing these two functions as former governors had\r\ndone. [556]\r\n\r\nMany disagreements took place between the audiencia and Governor\r\nMarquina, who succeeded Basco y Vargas. Marquina quarreled with the\r\naudiencia over almost every act of government in which he had relations\r\nwith the tribunal. Marquina was said to have repeatedly disregarded\r\nthe acuerdo and to have done as he pleased in matters wherein the\r\naudiencia had been or should have been consulted. There was a bitter\r\ncontest in 1789, shortly after the arrival of this governor, because\r\nhe had excused various officials of real hacienda from appearing when\r\nsummoned to the audiencia to serve as witnesses. Marquina did this, he\r\nclaimed, because they were needed in the provinces as financial agents,\r\nand because their absence from their posts of duty would entail a grave\r\nloss to the government. The audiencia solved the matter by forwarding\r\nall the correspondence relative to these cases to the Council of the\r\nIndies. It may be said that Marquina, in exempting these witnesses,\r\nwas acting in his capacity as president of the audiencia, but in\r\nhis solicitude that no loss should occur to the royal exchequer he\r\nwas acting as superintendent of real hacienda, which was within his\r\nauthority. [557]\r\n\r\nIn 1790 Marquina recommended the abolition of the audiencia on the\r\ngrounds that its continued presence constituted an obstruction to\r\nthe harmonious working of the machinery of government. He said that\r\nthe tribunal was a powerful weapon in the hands of men who used it\r\nfor their own personal advancement. In the place of an audiencia\r\nhe suggested the substitution of three asesores, one for civil and\r\ncriminal cases, one for real hacienda, and another for commerce and the\r\nconsulado. These asesores would have jurisdiction over the cases which\r\ncorresponded to these three departments. This scheme, he believed,\r\nwould effectively provide for all the judicial cases arising in the\r\nIslands. [558] To this scheme, however, the Council paid no heed.\r\n\r\nConsiderable attention has been given in another chapter to\r\nthe charges made by the audiencia against Marquina at the\r\ntime of his residencia. These complaints show that a state of\r\ncontinual disagreement had existed between these two authorities\r\nthroughout the entire term of the governor, and the bringing of\r\nthese charges was instrumental in making Marquina undergo a very\r\nstrict investigation. Personal jealousy was no small factor in these\r\ncontinual recriminations. At no subsequent date, however, were the\r\nlarge issues at stake which were characteristic of the struggle between\r\nthe audiencia and the governor at the time of Fajardo, Curuzaelegui,\r\nand Bustamante. Those were death-struggles on the issue of whether\r\nthe audiencia should be an independent tribunal or whether it should\r\nbe subservient and subject to the governor. During those struggles the\r\ntribunal was momentarily suppressed, or converted into an instrument,\r\nin the hands of the governor. But these were exceptional cases, and\r\nduring the greater part of the long period of three hundred years\r\nthe relations between the audiencia and the executive were not so\r\ndiscordant as they would seem to have been, judging by the instances\r\ncited in this chapter. The audiencia, on all occasions of dispute\r\nwith the governor, was able to offer a formidable resistance to his\r\nso-called encroachments on the prerogatives of the tribunal. Although\r\nthe governor, on most of the occasions noted above, occupied the\r\nstronger position, owing to his more recent instructions, the support\r\ngiven to him by the church, and his control of the residencias of the\r\nmagistrates, nevertheless it may be said that either authority was\r\nsufficiently powerful and independent to be respected as an antagonist\r\nby the other, and each was indispensable to the other.\r\n\r\nThese disagreements have been discussed in the foregoing pages largely\r\nfrom the view-point of the audiencia. Practically all the charges and\r\ncomplaints which have been cited were made in behalf of the audiencia,\r\nand these show the magistrates in almost all cases to have been acting\r\nin defense of their rights against usurpation and tyranny. Fairness\r\ndemands, however, that the other side should be presented in the\r\nsame manner. [559] Reference will now be made to a few of the many\r\nmemorials heretofore unquoted, which were sent by various governors\r\nin protest against the alleged excesses of the audiencia.\r\n\r\nAs a first instance we may note the criticisms which Governor Gómez\r\nPérez Dasmariñas made of the first audiencia which served from 1584\r\nto 1589. We shall also consider the complaints which Dasmariñas made\r\nagainst Pedro de Rojas, former oidor and later teniente and asesor of\r\nthat governor (1589-1593). Dasmariñas came to the colony shortly after\r\nthe first audiencia had been suppressed and from his correspondence\r\none may estimate the prevailing opinion of the tribunal which had\r\nbeen recently removed. The governor wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    As the royal Audiencia was here so haughty and domineering, he\r\n    (Pedro de Rojas) retains that authority and harshness, with which\r\n    he tries to reduce all others as his vassals. In the matters of\r\n    justice that he discusses, he is unable to be impartial, but is\r\n    in many matters very biased. This is because of his trading and\r\n    trafficking, which the president and all the auditors (oidores)\r\n    carried on from the time of their arrival--and with so great\r\n    avidity, trying to secure it all to themselves, that I find no\r\n    rich men here beside them. This is the reason why Rojas ... and\r\n    the auditors opposed the pancada in order that the consignments\r\n    of money sent by them to China might not be known--which, at last,\r\n    have come to light. [560]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe governor charged the audiencia, moreover, with having opposed\r\nthe three per cent tax levied for the construction of the city\r\nwall. Indeed, he accused the magistrates of having influenced\r\nthe friars to oppose all his acts as governor. He referred to\r\nthe commercial excesses of the oidores, saying: \"If the matter of\r\ninspection and the residencia held here had fallen to my order and\r\ncommission, as it fell to that of the Viceroy of Nueva España, I\r\nwould have proved to your Majesty the investments of past years.\" He\r\nconcluded with the statement that Rojas had been so busy with gain that\r\nhe had been unable to attend to his other duties; he was \"puffed up\r\nwith the authority and name of auditor\" (i. e., oidor). He protested\r\nagainst the transfer of Rojas to an office in Mexico, \"for,\" he wrote,\r\n\"such men go delighted with their interests and gains from trade here,\r\nthey are fettered and biased by their relations with the trade of\r\nthis country.\"\r\n\r\nThus we see that even this early in the history of the Islands,\r\nthe oidores as well as the governors were accused of a predominating\r\ninterest in commercial affairs.\r\n\r\nGovernor Pedro de Acuña recommended the suppression of the audiencia\r\nin 1604, although he said that he had had no serious trouble with\r\nthat tribunal. His chief reason in favoring its removal was that\r\nan appreciable saving would be realized thereby. The audiencia was,\r\nmoreover, very unpopular in Manila. He alleged that the name of oidor\r\nwas so odious that it was in itself an offense. He stated that affairs\r\nhad come to such a pass that\r\n\r\n\r\n    because I, in conformity to what your Majesty has ordered, have\r\n    attempted to maintain and have maintained amicable relations\r\n    with the auditors; and have shown, on various occasions, more\r\n    patience and endurance than the people considered right; and more\r\n    than seemed fitting to my situation, in order not to give rise to\r\n    scandal; some have conceived hatred for me, publicly saying that\r\n    ... I was neglecting to look after them, and that I could correct\r\n    the evil which the Audiencia was doing. But as I cannot do that,\r\n    it has seemed to me the best means to let the public see that\r\n    there was good feeling between me and the Audiencia. [561]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we have the case of a governor, who, in order to get along in\r\nharmony with a quarrelsome and unpopular audiencia, gave way to it\r\non many occasions, and even incurred the displeasure of the residents\r\nof the colony on account of what seemed to them to be the governor's\r\neasy-going attitude. His zeal for the king's service, as he expressed\r\nit, moved him to recommend the abolition of the tribunal. He said that\r\nthe audiencia would not be missed if it were removed, since there\r\nwere only twelve hundred residents in the colony and there were few\r\ncases to be tried. Most of the suits arising in the Islands could\r\nbe adjudicated by the alcaldes ordinarios and appeals could be sent\r\nto Mexico. The acuerdo, or administrative session, Acuña alleged,\r\nexisted in name only.\r\n\r\nAcuña made practically the same charges that have been so often\r\nrepeated already in this chapter. The magistrates had interfered\r\nin the appointment of officials, which the governor claimed as his\r\nsole prerogative. Each magistrate was accompanied on his journey\r\nto the Islands by a vast company of relatives and dependents,\r\nwho came to get rich. These persons ultimately monopolized all the\r\noffices. Notwithstanding the king's orders which forbade that offices\r\nshould be held by relatives of oidores, the governor was placed in\r\nsuch a position that if he did not allow these persons to hold office,\r\nthe magistrates would take revenge by opposing him at every turn, thus\r\nruining the success of his administration. [562] The same was true of\r\ntrade, for these relatives had to live, and if the government could\r\nnot support them, they had to be assigned privileges and advantages\r\nin trade, which the oidores by virtue of their official positions\r\ncould guarantee. [563]\r\n\r\nIn view of all these abuses and evils which, directly or indirectly,\r\nproceeded from the audiencia, Acuña maintained that all the powers of\r\ngovernment, war and justice, should be concentrated in the office of\r\ngovernor and captain-general. The country, he said, was more at war\r\nthan at peace. It was essentially military, by virtue of its location\r\nand isolation. Acuña contended that all authorities and departments\r\nof the government should therefore be dependent on a military chief\r\nrather than on a high court of justice which was out of sympathy\r\nwith the spirit and needs of the colony. In a government so new as\r\nthat of the Philippines, the same laws and punishments should not\r\nbe enforced so rigidly as in more settled parts, yet the magistrates\r\nof the audiencia had failed to understand that their functions in a\r\ncolony of this character should be in any way different than those of\r\na similar tribunal in Spain. Acuña stated that there had been occasions\r\nin which the audiencia, in possession of partial evidence in regard to\r\na military matter, had interfered with an action which the governor\r\nhad wished to take. He had thus been rendered powerless to exercise\r\nsovereignty which rightfully belonged to him, and which, if put into\r\neffect, would no doubt have been for the best interests of the colony.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above representations, the governor laid great\r\nstress on the financial advantages which would be derived from a\r\nsuppression of the tribunal. He stated that the colony was short\r\nof money, a condition of which the magistrates were well aware,\r\nyet they always insisted on being the first to collect their own\r\nsalaries, to the exclusion, if necessary, of all other officials in the\r\ncolony. [564] With the money saved from the abolition of the audiencia,\r\nan armed fleet could be provided for the defense of the Islands. This\r\nwas badly needed, and there was no other way of obtaining the necessary\r\nships. The Chinese rebellion of the year before [565] had caused\r\na diminution of 46,000 pesos in the commercial duties collected,\r\n[566] and the consequent shortage of money in the treasury of the\r\ncolony furnished further reasons for the dismissal of this useless\r\nand burdensome tribunal. Acuña admitted that the institution of\r\nthe audiencia might be successful in larger dependencies of Spain,\r\nwhere the people were prosperous and where the government had an\r\nassured income, but in the Philippines, where the citizens were poor,\r\nwith scarcely any means of support, and harassed by many magistrates\r\nand their dependents, the audiencia had been a failure and a serious\r\nburden.\r\n\r\nAcuña's concluding statement very aptly sizes up the situation and\r\nvoices his demand for the abolition of the tribunal. He wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The difficulty which presents itself to me in this matter is\r\n    that, if the Audiencia is abolished and everything left in charge\r\n    of the governor, there will be but slow and poor remedy for the\r\n    grievances and disorders which may occur. For they must be taken to\r\n    the Audiencia of Mexico, which is so far away that the aggrieved\r\n    ones would consume both life and property before the business was\r\n    settled ... all say that they consider government by one person the\r\n    best, when he governs justly. These men (who believe in the above)\r\n    know what the governor can do without the Audiencia, and with it;\r\n    and they believe that it is better when there are not so many\r\n    to command them, for they have never seen the audiencias redress\r\n    illegal acts by the governors.... Although there is no doubt that\r\n    much of what this paper recounts occurs in other regions where\r\n    there are audiencias, it must be remembered that in this country,\r\n    which is the newest of all and more engaged in war than any of the\r\n    others; and where the hardships of conquest and maintenance are\r\n    so omnipresent; and your Majesty has little profit or advantage,\r\n    except the cargo of cloth which goes to Nueva Hespaña (sic), and\r\n    which is divided among all; and as the resources of the country are\r\n    so scant that there is no place to go in order to seek a livelihood\r\n    outside of Manila: there is much criticism in this matter, and the\r\n    people are much aggrieved at seeing themselves in the utmost part\r\n    of the world, harassed and troubled by so many magistrates and\r\n    officers and their dependents, and at having so many to satisfy;\r\n    and that matters are in such a state that he who has an auditor\r\n    for a protector may, it appears, go wherever he wishes and with\r\n    as much as he wishes, and he who has not must be ruined. [567]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the administration of Governor Alonso Fajardo\r\n(1618-1624), whose relations with the audiencia we have already\r\nshown to have been very unpleasant. Fully as many charges were\r\nbrought against the oidores by that governor as were put forward\r\nby the magistrates against him. According to Fajardo, the oidores\r\nhad so used their power of appointment that it amounted to virtual\r\ndictation. Fajardo, like Acuña, found his control over the filling\r\nof offices greatly diminished. He energetically protested against the\r\nproposition which had been made to increase the size of the court from\r\nfour to five magistrates. He stated that the amount of legal business\r\nwhich came before the tribunal did not justify an augmentation of\r\nthe number of oidores; he recommended that the magistrates should\r\nspend their time more advantageously, and waste less in quarreling\r\namong themselves and in wreaking their passions on their rivals. Like\r\nAcuña, Fajardo complained against the presence of so large a number\r\nof relatives and personal followers of the oidores, whose lust for\r\noffice had to be satisfied. [568] The magistrates had engaged in trade\r\nthrough intermediaries, and had spent the time which should have\r\nbeen devoted to the administration of justice in devising schemes\r\nwhereby they and their agents could get the most out of forbidden\r\ncommercial transactions, and at the same time be protected in their\r\nillicit activities. Fajardo claimed that the magistrates had abused\r\ntheir positions to such an extent that they had become an intolerable\r\nincumbrance to the colony.\r\n\r\nStrife and discord between the audiencia and the governor were perhaps\r\nmore bitter during the administration of Fajardo than at any other time\r\nin the history of the Islands. This governor accused the magistrates\r\nof deliberately attempting in all petty and inconsequential ways to\r\nharass him into compliance with its desires. He wrote that he had\r\ndone everything possible to keep peace with the oidores, even at a\r\nsacrifice of the respect of the other elements of the colony. [569]\r\nThis testimony is practically identical with that submitted by\r\nGovernor Acuña in 1604. The influence of the tribunal in the matter of\r\nappointments, judging by this and by other statements and allegations\r\nalready quoted, and by the laws themselves, must have been great.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to fill offices with friends and relatives was\r\ncharacteristic not only of the magistrates, but of the viceroys and\r\ngovernors as well. More laws are to be found in the Recopilación\r\nwhich guard against such abuses by governors and viceroys than by\r\nthe magistrates of the audiencia. [570] Bearing in mind, of course,\r\nthat there are two sides to the question, it is at least clear that\r\nthe audiencia was successful in one of the purposes for which it was\r\ncreated--namely, that of preventing the governor from exercising entire\r\ncontrol over appointments. We have the confession of Governor Fajardo\r\nhere and of Governor Acuña in the preceding paragraphs that those\r\ngovernors were unable to prevent the oidores from filling offices with\r\ntheir own friends. Although we have been following the governor's side\r\nof the question in these last few pages, we have noted in the preceding\r\nchapter that the laws of the Indies gave to the audiencia the right of\r\nparticipating in acuerdo with the governor in matters of appointment.\r\n\r\nGovernor Fajardo's method of referring matters to the audiencia\r\nfor advice is interesting. Instead of submitting questions to the\r\nacuerdo for the general advice and opinion of all the oidores, he was\r\nsaid to have sought to escape the obligation of acting in accordance\r\nwith the advice given him, by asking the oidores for their individual\r\nopinions concerning matters on which he desired advice. The audiencia\r\ntook exception to this method of procedure, alleging that he was\r\nthus escaping the responsibilities of the acuerdo. Fajardo defended\r\nhimself against the accusation by the statement that the oidores met\r\ntogether so seldom that he had been unable to submit questions to\r\nthe magistrates collectively in accordance with the law.\r\n\r\nFajardo also complained against the failure of the oidores to comply\r\nwith his instructions in regard to the inspection of the provinces. He\r\nstated that the magistrates disliked to bestir themselves from their\r\ninactive and indolent lives amid the comforts of Manila, and no\r\ninspections had been made during the three years prior to the date\r\nof this letter. Philip III, without raising his voice in indignation\r\nor decreeing any punishment upon those officials who had refused to\r\nexecute his decrees, mildly solicited that they should devote their\r\ncare and attention to the matter in the future. He remonstrated that\r\nthis was the only way in which the facts relating to the country and\r\nto the interests and needs of its people could be ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n    These inspections are very essential, since they are based on the\r\n    relief of miserable persons, and in no way can the condition of\r\n    affairs be fully ascertained unless by means of these inspections;\r\n    and the most advisable measures can hardly be well understood,\r\n    if the condition and facts of what ought to be remedied and\r\n    can be bettered are not known. Hence I again charge you to\r\n    pay especial attention to these inspections. The Audiencia\r\n    is commanded to observe the orders that you shall give in your\r\n    capacity as president so that each auditor, when it concerns him,\r\n    may observe his obligations and go out on the inspections. [571]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reply to these observations, the Council ordered Fajardo to\r\nmake recommendations for the reform of the government, stating\r\nthat such suggestions as he would make would be duly considered and\r\nobserved. [572]\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in the Islands, Fajardo, as yet unfamiliar with the\r\nduties and conditions of his office, expressed his unwillingness to\r\nrecommend the entire abolition of the audiencia, preferring to have\r\npresent a council which he could consult regarding the problems of\r\nhis new office. The tribunal in the Philippines was probably not so\r\nimportant as were those in Spain, under the immediate supervision of\r\nthe king, \"where,\" as he expressed it,\r\n\r\n\r\n    one obtains strict justice, administered by upright and holy\r\n    men--the people here considering that those who are farthest from\r\n    meriting that name are those who are farthest from the presence\r\n    of your Majesty and your royal counselors.... In what pertains\r\n    to me, I do not petition you for anything in this matter, since\r\n    in no respect can it be ill for me to have someone to consult,\r\n    and who will relieve me in matters of justice. [573]\r\n\r\n\r\nFajardo's act in forming a new audiencia after he had suppressed the\r\nreal one shows that the audiencia was essential to him in the two\r\nparticulars mentioned by him in the above letter.\r\n\r\nThat his attitude towards this question was somewhat altered by three\r\nyears' experience as governor of the Philippines is shown in his\r\nmemorial of July 21, 1621. On this occasion Fajardo argued against\r\nthe continuation of the tribunal, showing himself to be of the same\r\nopinion as Acuña, who, it will be remembered, contended that because\r\nthe colony was military in character, there should be one person to\r\ncontrol affairs, without any interference whatsoever. He wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I beg your Majesty that while it shall last (the war) you may\r\n    be pleased to discontinue the Audiencia here, as it is this that\r\n    most hinders and opposes the administration and the government,\r\n    ... This is the enemy which most afflicts this commonwealth, and\r\n    most causes dissensions, parties, factions, and hatred between\r\n    the citizens--each auditor persecuting those citizens who are not\r\n    wholly of his own faction, especially those who extend aid and\r\n    good-will toward the governor, against whom, as it seems, they\r\n    show themselves always in league. They always make declarations\r\n    of grievances [against him] because they are not each one given,\r\n    as used to be and is the custom here, whatever they may ask\r\n    for their sons, relatives and servants; and they habitually\r\n    discredit the governor by launching through secret channels false\r\n    and malicious reports, and afterward securing witnesses of their\r\n    publicity. They even, as I have written to your Majesty, manage to\r\n    have religious and preachers publish these reports to which end,\r\n    and for his own security, each one of the auditors has formed an\r\n    alliance with the religious order which receives him best. [574]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I consider this government much more difficult, with the auditors\r\n    of this Audiencia, than it is or would be even if there were more\r\n    war, for that war which they cause within its boundaries appears\r\n    beyond remedy, on account of their abilities and rank. [575]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn abundance of evidence exists on both sides of this controversy;\r\nletters of complaint against the governor and charges against the\r\noidores by the governor. The vividness and apparent directness of\r\nthe charges and the apparent sincerity of both the governor and the\r\noidores make it extremely difficult, and, in fact, quite impossible\r\nto decide on the basis of the evidence presented, who was right or\r\nwrong, which charges, true or untrue, and who was really responsible\r\nfor the difficulties. It would appear that the king was prone to\r\nsympathize with the governor rather than with the audiencia, for in\r\npractically all cases the decision of the sovereign was adverse to\r\nthe tribunal. The fact that the governor was the royal representative\r\nwas probably a large factor in securing him the support of the home\r\ngovernment. Yet, on the other hand, the audiencia was in the same\r\nsense the royal tribunal.\r\n\r\nGovernor Fajardo affords an example of a successful military man\r\nwho, having won fame for himself in the wars of the continent, but\r\nwithout legal knowledge or administrative experience, was called to the\r\ngovernment of a distant and isolated colony, with the responsibility of\r\ncontinuing in harmonious relations with a hostile civil and judicial\r\ntribunal on the one hand, with whose powers and functions he was\r\nnot familiar, and an equally hostile religious institution on the\r\nother. Men of military training usually had great contempt for the\r\nabilities and good intentions of priests and lawyers in those days,\r\nand it was frequently evident, both by their actions and by their\r\nown confessions, that conquistadores of the stamp of Fajardo, Acuña,\r\nand Corcuera were little fitted for the exercise of administrative\r\nand governmental functions, however useful they might be in adding\r\nto the domain of the Spanish empire.\r\n\r\nThus, there being present in the colony a tribunal of trained lawyers\r\nwho were at the same time capable and experienced administrators,\r\nthe governors became accustomed to rely on them for advice and\r\nassistance, in compliance with the commands of the laws of the\r\nIndies. As one governor of military tastes and training succeeded\r\nanother, each lacking administrative ability and experience, the\r\naudiencia came to assume an increased share in the governmental\r\nactivity of the colony. This tendency was accentuated by the fact\r\nthat the governor was absent from the capital city on campaigns of\r\nconquest and defense a large share of his time. Ability as a soldier\r\nand commander was always the chief criterion for the selection of a\r\ngovernor and captain-general, and military affairs were given more\r\nattention by far than matters of administration. Spain's policy\r\nof selecting soldiers instead of administrators for the post of\r\ngovernor went far towards making the audiencia more than a court of\r\njustice, and towards giving it a share in the executive functions\r\nof government. This tendency was also furthered by the fact that\r\nthe audiencia came to assume the entire administration on the death\r\nor absence of the governor, a power which it did not always exercise\r\nwell, but which it always relinquished with reluctance.\r\n\r\nThe Salcedo affair in 1668-1670 emphasizes other differences than\r\nthose of the audiencia and the governor, yet reference should be\r\nmade to it in this connection, because, after all, the oidores were\r\nconcerned indirectly in the struggle. An examination of the data at\r\nour command will reveal the fact that the refusal or failure of the\r\noidores to intervene in behalf of the governor led to his defeat and\r\nhumiliation by the commissary of the Inquisition. The audiencia might\r\nhave prevented that disaster had the magistrates been so inclined.\r\n\r\nBefore Governor Salcedo was arrested, imprisoned and sent to Mexico\r\nin 1668 by the commissary of the Inquisition on charges of a purely\r\necclesiastical character, the two oidores, Bónifaz and Montemayor,\r\nwere consulted by the enemies of the governor as to the legality\r\nof the proposed action. There is every reason to believe that the\r\nentire plot was worked out beforehand with the fore-knowledge and\r\nconsent of the oidores. Inharmonious relations had existed before the\r\narrest of the governor between Salcedo and his associates, because\r\nof his independence and his unwillingness to provide offices and\r\nopportunities for commercial profit for their relatives. The exact\r\npart which the audiencia played in the arrest of Salcedo is not known,\r\nsince the entire plot was schemed and executed under the cloak of the\r\nInquisition; but the fact remains that Oidores Montemayor and Bónifaz\r\neach hoped to assume the management of governmental affairs upon the\r\nexile of Salcedo. Indeed, the ambitions of Bónifaz were realized. The\r\nremoval of Salcedo culminated in the usurpation of the government by\r\nBónifaz, in the exile of Montemayor, his rival, to the provinces, and\r\nin the complete suppression of the audiencia for a year. It is said\r\nthat Bónifaz, through a usurper, ruled beneficently and well, and that\r\nhe little deserved the sentence of death which was pronounced on him\r\nby the Council of the Indies. The authority for the assertion that\r\nhis rule was meritorious was ecclesiastical and hence, in this case,\r\npossibly questionable. [576] It is certain, at least, that Bónifaz and\r\nhis government were under the complete domination of the church. [577]\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently stated in this chapter, that jealousy and\r\nrivalry were always determining factors in the relationship of\r\nthe audiencia and the governor. A new executive, until familiar\r\nwith the duties of his station, was always glad to seek the advice\r\nand assistance of the oidores, meanwhile permitting the audiencia\r\nto assume many functions which belonged to him as governor. A new\r\ngovernor was gracious, and agreeable to all, and we find that most\r\nof the favorable comments made concerning governors by magistrates,\r\nprelates, and officials were pronounced when the environment was new\r\nto them or to the governor. When the routine of official duties became\r\nirksome and opportunities for private profit presented themselves,\r\nas always happened in the course of time, friction arose, and jealousy\r\nand discord took the place of the goodwill and harmony which at first\r\nseemed so promising.\r\n\r\nThe most contaminating influence in the colony was the commercial\r\nspirit. Governors and magistrates engaged in trade on a large scale,\r\nand the churchmen also yielded to the commercial instinct. The latter\r\nassertion will be enlarged upon in its proper place; proof of the\r\ncommercial activities of governors and magistrates has already been\r\ngiven. The resentment of the oidores always led them to place every\r\nconceivable opposition in the way of the governor when it was seen\r\nthat he was obtaining more than his fair share of profit from trade,\r\nappointments, or indulgences to the Chinese. This led to a refusal\r\nto ratify his appointments in many cases, to oppose him in the\r\nacuerdo, to incite the residents of the colony against him, and to do\r\neverything possible to make a failure of his administration. Governors\r\non the other hand might employ one of two methods in dealing with the\r\nmagistrates. That most commonly pursued was to allow them a liberal\r\nshare of the booty, commercial or political, the latter obtained\r\nby permitting them to disregard the law by giving offices to their\r\nrelatives and followers, thereby purchasing their favor. The other\r\nmethod was to meet their charges with counter-charges, which were\r\nprobably as truthful, though usually not so serious as those which the\r\nmagistrates made against them. The administrations of those governors\r\nwho openly opposed the audiencia and sought to keep it within the\r\nlimits of its jurisdiction as a judicial tribunal, were most notable\r\nfor their conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Madrid was unable to remedy these defects in colonial\r\nadministration. It could and did discipline the officials by sending\r\nan occasional visitor, or by forcing them to give vigorous residencias,\r\nbut these punishments only led to greater abuses in order to reimburse\r\nthemselves for the fines which they had to pay. Officials were able\r\nto send away large sums of money and consignments of merchandise,\r\nand then, after having paid liberal penalties, they returned\r\nto Spain and lived in comfortable retirement. Acceptance of the\r\noffice of governor, oidor, corregidor, or alcalde mayor was made\r\nwith a foreknowledge that disputes would arise, enemies would bring\r\naccusations, and punishments would be meted out, whether deserved or\r\nnot. This condition led to the abuses which have been noted, and the\r\nrecriminations and struggles between authorities. From the view-point\r\nof these officials the Philippines were neither governed for the good\r\nof the natives nor for the residents, nor for the honor of Spain, nor\r\nfor the propagation of the Catholic religion, but merely for the profit\r\nand advancement of those who were on the ground to take advantage\r\nof their opportunities. They were struggles for profit; pure and\r\nsimple contests between the officials either to get all the proceeds\r\npossible from their offices or to keep other officials from getting\r\nall, and thus to get a share for themselves. There were exceptions,\r\nof course, to the conditions and circumstances just noted. Some\r\nable and well-intentioned men came to the Islands, as came to all of\r\nSpain's colonies, among whom may be mentioned Oidor Antonio de Morga,\r\nthe fiscal, Francisco Leandro de Viana, and Governors Anda y Salazar,\r\nBasco y Vargas, Aguilar, Enrile, and others of the nineteenth century\r\nwhen opportunities for gain were somewhat diminished. Some of these\r\nofficials erred on the side of over-strictness, and their efforts to\r\nrestrain the avarice of their colleagues and to infuse the spirit of\r\nhonesty into their administrations united the opposition and led to\r\nbattles as violent and unrelenting as those which were fought when\r\nall parties were dishonest.\r\n\r\nIn a chapter which deals alone with the conflicts of jurisdiction\r\nwhich occurred between the governor and the audiencia, it would be\r\npossible to arrive at an entirely mistaken conclusion. Disagreements\r\nand differences were frequent as well as pronounced, yet the history\r\nof the Philippines throughout the three hundred years of Spanish rule\r\nis not a record of perpetual strife. It is, of course, understood\r\nthat no effort has been made in this chapter to describe all the\r\nstruggles which occurred in the Islands between the audiencia and\r\nthe governor. Those which have been reviewed were selected for the\r\npurpose because they illustrate, in a general way, the subjects over\r\nwhich disagreements arose, and the principles underlying them.\r\n\r\nWe have noted, in general, that the audiencia exercised functions\r\nand prerogatives which were not conferred upon it by the laws of the\r\nIndies. The type of men who were appointed to the office of governor\r\nand captain-general made inevitable the accretion of power in the\r\nhands of the magistrates. The audiencia gradually came to assume\r\nmore attributes than the solely judicial ones. Necessity compelled\r\nthe governor in many instances to entrust the tribunal with many of\r\nhis own functions because of his lack of skill and experience as an\r\nadministrator or on account of his devotion to military affairs. In\r\nthese ways the acuerdo came to be legislative as well as advisory; the\r\nfrequent absence of the governor, or his death, led to the audiencia's\r\nassumption of the governorship and the tribunal was always reluctant\r\nto surrender the administrative powers once gained.\r\n\r\nJealousy between officials and the resultant conflicts of authority\r\nmay be classified together as a cause of strife. These difficulties\r\nresulted in part from the fact that the sphere of authority of each\r\nofficial was not defined with exactness in the laws of the Indies,\r\nand also because those laws were often countermanded by later\r\ncédulas of whose existence the colonial officials were not always\r\naware. Spanish laws were frequently repealed and subsequently put\r\nin force without notice; this was always a source of confusion. Then\r\nagain the exceptional opportunities for trade offered by the transfer\r\nof the rich oriental cargoes at Manila tempted oidores and governors\r\nalike. The trading privileges conceded by the government did not\r\nalways end when the limit of permission was reached. Some officials,\r\nand particularly governors, could command more than their rightful\r\nshare of galleon space; this led to disputes and recriminations which\r\noften interfered seriously with the government. We have noted that the\r\nappointing power which belonged nominally to the governor and which was\r\nshared by the oidores was also a source of much trouble. The knowledge\r\nthat the residencia would ultimately bring about the punishment of\r\nguilty officials and enemies, the distance and isolation of the colony,\r\nand the length of time necessary for communication--all these factors\r\nmade it possible for officials to commit excesses. Another cause of\r\ndiscord was what might be termed the reaction of the executive against\r\nthe increased power and authority of the audiencia. This accretion\r\nof power was due to the complete dependence of the governor on the\r\ntribunal in administrative matters, especially at the beginning of\r\nhis term, the increasing power of the acuerdo, the superiority of the\r\naudiencia as a court of appeals from the decisions of the governor,\r\nand the fact that the latter always needed the presence of the\r\naudiencia to lend legality to his government.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated, nevertheless, that the governor actually held the\r\nmore powerful position in the colony, and that he most frequently\r\nemerged victor in the various struggles with the audiencia. Various\r\nreasons may be assigned for this. The governor was the personal\r\nrepresentative of the king, and in this capacity he had the backing\r\nof the home government. He commanded the military forces in the\r\ncolony. The authority of the royal patronage was vested in the\r\ngovernor; he was thus often able to command the support of the church\r\nand clergy in his struggles with the audiencia. The authority over the\r\ndisposal of offices, either by sale or appointment belonged legally to\r\nthe governor, although this power was effectively disputed and often\r\nshared by the audiencia. The governor employed the last-mentioned power\r\non some occasions to the extent of reforming and reconstituting the\r\naudiencia, thus making the government entirely dependent on him. A\r\nnew governor always carried with him a more recent appointment than\r\nthose of the oidores whom he found in the colony, and aside from this\r\nhe usually possessed definite instructions embodying the royal will\r\non all current issues. The control of the residencias of the oidores\r\nwas usually in the hands of the governor, and lastly, the laissez\r\nfaire attitude of the Spanish government, its extreme conservatism,\r\nand its apparent reluctance to correct the evils and abuses which\r\nwere reported to it--all these were potent factors in leaving the\r\nbalance of power as it had been, in the hands of the governor,\r\nnotwithstanding the presence of the audiencia.\r\n\r\nA previously quoted statement made by a famous British historian in\r\nhis description of the relative powers of the viceroys of New Spain,\r\nand Perú, and their respective audiencias, may be used here, with\r\nequal effect, to characterize the situation in the Philippines, and\r\nto summarize this part of our discussion: \"They (the magistrates of\r\nthe audiencia) may advise, they may remonstrate; but in the event of\r\na direct collision between their opinion and the will of the viceroy\r\n(governor), what he determines must be brought into execution, and\r\nnothing remains for them but to lay the matter before the king and\r\nthe Council of the Indies.\" [578]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE AUDIENCIA AND THE GOVERNOR: THE AD INTERIM RULE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most extensive non-judicial activity in which the audiencia\r\nparticipated at any time was its assumption of the provisional\r\ngovernment of the colony during vacancies in the governorship. Aside\r\nfrom the ten different occasions on which this was done, the audiencia\r\nvery frequently assumed control of the government when the exigencies\r\nof defense and foreign conquest rendered necessary the temporary\r\nabsence of the governor. This was true at irregular intervals during\r\nthe administrations of Governors Pedro Bravo de Acuña (1602-1606),\r\nJuan de Silva (1609-1616), Juan Niño de Tavora (1626-1632), Sebastián\r\nHurtado de Corcuera (1635-1644) and Diego Fajardo (1644-1653). The\r\nadministrations of these several governors were characterized by\r\nextensive military operations, largely in a foreign field, and the\r\naudiencia not only took over governmental affairs but it assumed\r\nthe obligations of defense during their absence. On such occasions,\r\nof course, the tribunal retained its exercise of judicial functions.\r\n\r\nSince the audiencias in Perú and New Spain assumed the government\r\nmuch earlier than did the audiencia in the Philippines, and as the\r\nlaws authorizing the rule of the audiencia were promulgated first to\r\nmeet conditions in those viceroyalties, it seems advisable to inquire\r\ninto the circumstances surrounding the establishment and development\r\nof this practice there. Having done this, we shall proceed to a study\r\nof the ad interim rule of the Audiencia of Manila, noting particularly\r\nthe causes of the success or failure of its administration and the\r\neffect of this practice upon the subsequent relations of the audiencia\r\nand the governor.\r\n\r\nThe first law in the Recopilación authorizing the assumption of the\r\ngovernment by an audiencia was promulgated as early as March 19,\r\n1550. This law provided that in case of a vacancy in the office of\r\nViceroy of Perú, the audiencia there should succeed to the governments\r\nof Perú, Charcas, Quito and Tierra Firme, and that the three last-named\r\nsubordinate audiencias should obey the mandates of the Audiencia\r\nof Lima until a permanent successor to the viceroy was named. [579]\r\nThis law was proclaimed again on November 20, 1606.\r\n\r\nEven before the promulgation of the above law the audiencias of Lima\r\nand Mexico had assumed control of the government in their respective\r\nviceroyalties. Shortly after the death of Francisco Pizarro, the\r\nconqueror, an audiencia was sent to Perú, arriving at Lima in January,\r\n1544, in company with Blasco Núñez Vela, the first viceroy. The\r\nrigidity and thoroughness with which this new executive enforced the\r\nNew Laws which were entrusted to him met with the opposition of the\r\nresidents of the colony, and the audiencia accordingly removed him\r\nfrom his position as viceroy and suspended the operation of the code\r\nreferred to, assuming charge of affairs itself. [580] Its rule was\r\nbrief, however, for on October 28, 1544, it invited Gonzalo Pizarro,\r\nthe brother of the conqueror, into the city and turned the government\r\nover to him, proclaiming him Governor and Captain-General of Perú.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from 1544 to 1551, until the arrival in Perú of\r\nViceroy Mendoza, the audiencia exercised control of governmental\r\naffairs. It made and unmade captains-general and viceroys, irrespective\r\nof royal appointments. It suspended the New Laws of 1542 and its\r\ncommands were obeyed. From 1550 to 1551 it governed alone. In these\r\nincidents we note that the audiencia actually assumed the government\r\nad interim prior to the time of the promulgation of the law of March\r\n19, 1550, exercising administrative as well as judicial powers,\r\nthirty-five years before the Audiencia of Manila was created. \"To\r\nit (the audiencia) were confided in the beginning and later in\r\nthe absence of the viceroy,\" writes Moses, \"all matters with which\r\ngovernmental authority might properly deal.\" [581] He further states\r\nthat \"the audiencia in its executive capacity, failed to justify the\r\nexpectations of the king, and a new order of things was introduced\r\nby the appointment of a viceroy\" (Mendoza, April 17, 1535) for New\r\nSpain. [582]\r\n\r\nThese powers were not only exercised by the Audiencia of Lima, but\r\nalso by a second tribunal which was created in 1549 at Santa Fé de\r\nBogotá. The latter body was endowed permanently with both judicial\r\nand administrative powers, appealing important cases to the superior\r\ngovernment at Lima. This audiencia had the status of a presidency. Its\r\npresident was often captain-general, visitador, and senior magistrate,\r\nand in exercising the functions of these various offices he was in\r\nall respects the most powerful official in New Granada, always being\r\nable to enforce his will over the other magistrates. At times this\r\nofficial acted with entire independence of the Viceroy of Perú. [583]\r\nThe exercise of military functions by this president and audiencia\r\nis especially to be noticed in the part they played in putting down\r\nthe Pijáo Indian revolt in 1565. [584] On the whole, however, judging\r\nby the strife prevailing in the colony, the various struggles between\r\nthe oidores and the president, and between the audiencia or president\r\nand the archbishop, the government could never have been considered\r\nsuccessful. The official corruption which became apparent as a result\r\nof the pesquisas and residencias held during the rule of the Audiencia\r\nof Santa Fé could scarcely have encouraged the home government to\r\nentrust that tribunal with the administration of affairs in the future.\r\n\r\nThe defects referred to above in connection with the government\r\nof the Audiencia of Santa Fé did not deter the Spanish crown from\r\nfounding the Audiencia of Charcas in 1559. This tribunal, \"like\r\nthe audiencias established elsewhere, exercised not only judicial,\r\nbut also administrative powers.\" [585] It had jurisdiction over\r\nthe neighboring city of Potosí. Again we may note the case of the\r\nAudiencia of Santiago de Chile, which was established on August 27,\r\n1565. Its members arrived in 1567 and the audiencia was installed at\r\nConcepción \"as the supreme court of the colony, and, at the same time,\r\nin accordance with the royal decree, it became the administrative\r\nhead of the government. In this latter capacity it undertook to\r\nreorganize the military forces.\" Later, in 1568, Melchoir Bravo de\r\nSaravia assumed the office and functions of the governorship of Chile\r\n(1568-1575) and the audiencia became a judicial tribunal, without\r\nother attributes. [586]\r\n\r\nWe may gather from these various citations taken from the early\r\nhistory of the audiencias of South America that these tribunals not\r\nonly exercised the authority of governing ad interim, but that they\r\nhad permanent governmental and administrative powers as well. It\r\nwould seem, as Professor Moses has suggested, that the original\r\npurpose of the Spanish government had been to entrust the executive\r\nand administrative functions in the dependencies to the audiencia, and\r\nthat the endowment of the viceroys and captains-general with extensive\r\nexecutive powers was an expedient to which Spain was obliged to turn\r\nafter the breakdown of the audiencia as an administrative agency. The\r\nmain fact to be emphasized in this connection is that during the\r\nperiod of the promulgation of the laws which we are now studying,\r\nthe minor audiencias were exercising regular governmental powers.\r\n\r\nThe Audiencia of Mexico, which was created in 1527 to check the\r\nexcesses of Hernán Cortés, had participated in governmental affairs\r\neven before the events described above. This tribunal, which was\r\ncomposed of four magistrates, with the notorious Guzmán as president,\r\nconducted the residencias of Cortés and his followers, and after\r\nobtaining control of the government, administered affairs to suit\r\nits own convenience. [587] It was at this time, and as a result of\r\nthese abuses, Bancroft tells us, that the Spanish government decided\r\nto establish a viceroyalty in New Spain, with a semiregal court and\r\nregal pretensions. A new tribunal was left in charge of governmental\r\naffairs while this reform was being inaugurated. This second audiencia\r\ngoverned with great satisfaction, correcting the abuses of its\r\npredecessor and devoting itself to various improvements. [588]\r\n\r\nAlthough the audiencia of 1528-1535 exercised the administrative\r\nfunctions above mentioned, Bancroft brings forth no evidence in\r\nsupport of the theory that it was ever the royal intention to entrust\r\nthe institution of the audiencia permanently with administrative\r\nauthority. He states that as early as 1530, three years after the\r\nestablishment of the first tribunal in Mexico, the sovereigns had\r\nalready decided to establish a viceroyalty. Although the audiencia\r\nwas entrusted with the government for a few years, the above facts\r\nwould seem to indicate that this was only a temporary arrangement. The\r\naudiencia's chief attributes were judicial, and we have repeatedly\r\nnoted that the principal object of its establishment, aside from\r\nthe administration of justice, was to check the abuses of the\r\ncaptain-general.\r\n\r\nCortés retained his rank as captain-general after the audiencia\r\nwas established. The conqueror was in reality reduced to a secondary\r\nposition, and he was compelled repeatedly to acknowledge the supremacy\r\nof the audiencia. His commission was recognized by the tribunal on its\r\narrival, but soon after its establishment the oidores exhibited a royal\r\norder requiring that \"Cortés, in all his operations, should consult\r\nthe president and oidores and act only on their approval.\" [589]\r\nEven in his field, as commander of the military forces, Cortés was\r\nsubordinated to the tribunal, and the audiencia and the conqueror\r\nquarrelled bitterly over practically all matters which presented\r\nthemselves for solution. The audiencia had been created to meet\r\nextraordinary and unusual conditions. It was the business of the\r\ntribunal to correct the abuses which had previously been inflicted\r\non the colony by Cortés, and it did so. On the arrival of Mendoza in\r\n1535, however, the audiencia surrendered the control of administrative\r\naffairs, and it did not assume them again, except in the regular way\r\nin conjunction with the viceroy, until it next served to administer\r\nthe ad interim government. [590]\r\n\r\nThe first legal provision for the succession of the audiencia\r\nin Mexico, according to Bancroft, was contained in the royal\r\ninstructions to Visitor Valderrama, who arrived in Mexico in\r\n1563. These instructions, says Bancroft, provided that in the event\r\nof the death or inability of the viceroy to discharge his duties, the\r\naudiencia should rule temporarily. [591] This was indeed timely, in\r\nview of the death of Viceroy Velasco on July 31, 1564. The audiencia,\r\nwhich was legally authorized to take charge of the government,\r\nwas under investigation when the death of the viceroy occurred,\r\nand the tribunal was dominated during the first half of its rule by\r\nthe visitor, who, Bancroft tells us, was virtually viceroy. [592]\r\nValderrama dismissed two of the oidores, and sent them to Spain. The\r\naudiencia was even less able to administer justice during the early\r\npart of its ad interim government than it had been when the viceroy\r\nwas alive. After the departure of the visitor, however, the audiencia\r\ninaugurated a season of proscription and reprisal which bade fair\r\nto include every opponent of the oidores in the colony. Matters had\r\nreached a very unsatisfactory state, indeed, when the new viceroy,\r\nthe Marqués de Falcés, arrived at Mexico on October 14, 1566. [593]\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the next important law dealing with\r\nthe question of the succession was not promulgated until 1600,\r\na continuance of this survey of affairs in New Spain will not be\r\nnecessary. The audiencia there did not again assume the government\r\nuntil 1612, and then only for a very short period. We have already\r\nnoticed the conditions under which the Audiencia of Mexico was\r\ncreated, and the various occasions on which it assumed charge\r\nof the government. Though entrusted with the government upon its\r\nestablishment, the example set by three years of its unsatisfactory\r\nrule convinced the Spanish monarch of the unwisdom of entrusting such\r\ngovernmental authority to the audiencia permanently. Therefore, a\r\nviceroy was sent out in 1535, and it was not until 1563 that the first\r\nlaw was promulgated which provided for the temporary government by\r\nthe audiencia when there was a vacancy in the office of viceroy. This\r\nwas thirteen years after such a law had been promulgated for Perú,\r\nand fourteen years after an audiencia had been created, with all the\r\nfunctions of government, at Santa Fé de Bogotá.\r\n\r\nThe cédula of February 12, 1569, following in sequence that of March\r\n5, 1550, provided that the faculty of filling vacancies among the\r\noficiales reales, in case of death or removal from office, should\r\nrest with the viceroy, president, or the audiencia, if the latter\r\nbody were governing. [594] This, of course, was a recognition of the\r\nprinciple of the assumption of the government by the audiencia. This\r\nlaw was not confined in its application to any particular territory,\r\nbut was general in its scope and applicable wherever an audiencia\r\nexisted. It was later confirmed by the cédula of August 24, 1619. [595]\r\n\r\nThe next law dealing with the subject of succession was promulgated on\r\nJanuary 3, 1600. It applied especially to New Spain, and it provided\r\nthat in case of a vacancy in the office of viceroy, either by death or\r\nby promotion, the audiencia should assume charge of the government of\r\nthe provinces there, and it should execute the duties which ordinarily\r\ndevolved upon the viceroy, performing them \"as he could, would and\r\nought to do.\" It furthermore ordered the subordinate Audiencia of\r\nGuadalajara, under such circumstances, to obey and fulfill the orders\r\nwhich the Audiencia of Mexico might give or send, in the same manner\r\nas it would do, were those orders issued by the viceroy. [596] Under\r\na separate title on this same date the assumption of the government\r\nof the minor dependencies of Perú and New Spain by the respective\r\naudiencias was authorized in case of the illness or absence of the\r\nviceroy. In other words, this law authorized in New Spain the same\r\nprocedure in case of the death or absence of the viceroy as had\r\nalready prevailed in South America for half a century.\r\n\r\nThe above laws form a precedent for the subsequent authorization of\r\nthe Audiencia of Manila to assume charge of the government on the\r\ndeath of the governor. This authorization was given on April 12,\r\n1664, but the Audiencia of Manila, like those of Mexico and Lima,\r\nhad already assumed the functions of the executive on four earlier\r\noccasions, and the king, in the cédula of 1664, merely recognized,\r\nwith some qualifications, a practice which had been followed in the\r\nPhilippines for half a century. A cédula dated as early as September\r\n13, 1608, had authorized the nomination in advance by the Viceroy of\r\nNew Spain of a resident of the Islands to assume the governorship on\r\nthe death of the regular governor. [597] The intention of this law\r\nseems to have been to guard against the ills incident to a vacancy\r\nin the governorship by an arrangement whereby some person should be\r\nappointed in advance and thus be ready to assume the command without\r\ndelay. Whatever the royal intentions may have been, this law was never\r\neffective in bringing about the benefits for which it was designed. In\r\nfact, this particular provision met with general dissatisfaction\r\nin the Philippines, and the audiencia, acting in accordance with\r\nthe custom observed in other parts of Spain's dominions, continued\r\nto govern on the demise of the governor, ruling two or three years\r\non some occasions, until the arrival of a temporary governor, sent\r\nfrom New Spain. So flagrantly was the prescribed method of procedure\r\nviolated in the Philippines that in 1630, Visitor Francisco de Rojas\r\ny Ornate reminded the Council of the Indies of the existing law (that\r\nof 1608) and recommended that henceforth on the death of a governor\r\nthe audiencia should have nothing to do with administration, but that\r\none of three persons secretly designated by the viceroy should take\r\nover the government at once, thus eliminating all possibility of the\r\ninterference of the tribunal. [598]\r\n\r\nThe irregularities and inconveniences arising from the inefficacy\r\nof the law of 1608 led to the promulgation of the cédulas of January\r\n30, 1635, and of April 2, 1664, and to the enactment of the consulta\r\nof September 9, 1669. These regulations applied exclusively to the\r\nPhilippines, and they legalized the intervention of the audiencia\r\nin governmental affairs on the death of the governor. The first of\r\nthese admitted the right of the audiencia to administer political\r\naffairs, but ordered that military defense should be in the hands\r\nof a person appointed in advance by the Viceroy of New Spain. The\r\ncédula of April 2, 1664, ordered that the audiencia should serve\r\ntemporarily during vacancies in the governorship until the temporary\r\nappointee of the viceroy should arrive. This law further prescribed\r\nthat the audiencia should assume charge of political affairs while the\r\nsenior magistrate should take over the military command. He was to see\r\nthat the forces and defenses of the Islands were adequately kept up,\r\nand that the soldiers were disciplined; he was authorized to command\r\nthem in case of insurrection or invasion. The consulta of September\r\n9, 1669, above referred to, re-enacted the cédula of April 2, 1664,\r\nbut in addition it specifically ordered that the viceroy should not\r\ndesignate a temporary governor until news of the death of the regular\r\nincumbent was received, and then that no resident or native of the\r\nPhilippines should be appointed. [599]\r\n\r\nThe Council of the Indies, by the law of September 29, 1623, had\r\nalready sought to guard against any undue assumption of power on\r\nthe part of the audiencia by ordering that when the viceroy was\r\nabsent from the capital city, but within his own district, he should\r\nstill retain his status as governor, and neither the audiencia nor\r\nany of the oidores should interfere in governmental affairs. [600]\r\nThis law was not applicable to the Philippines alone, but it was of\r\ngeneral validity, throughout Spain's dominions. The control of the\r\naudiencia in governmental affairs was only to become effective when\r\nthe governor was absent from the colony, or incapacitated through\r\nsickness or death. Otherwise the governor's sphere of authority was\r\nto be recognized by the tribunal.\r\n\r\nA variety of laws exist in the Recopilación prescribing the duties and\r\nconduct of the audiencia when it had charge of governmental affairs,\r\nand defining the relationship which should exist between the oidores\r\nunder such conditions. The magistrates were ordered to proceed\r\nharmoniously and moderately both in the execution of governmental\r\naffairs and in the administration of justice, not erring either on the\r\nside of excessive severity, or of undue moderation. They were to devote\r\nspecial attention to the increase and care of the royal revenue during\r\nthese times. [601] The right to grant encomiendas, essentially the\r\nfunction of the governing authority, was conceded to the audiencia\r\nwhen it acted in the capacity of governor. All such concessions\r\nultimately had to be confirmed by the king. On these occasions,\r\nalso, the audiencia filled vacancies and made appointments. However,\r\nthe oidores were warned against discharging officials and vacating\r\noffices in order to fill them with their dependents and friends. [602]\r\nAll appointments made by the audiencia were to become void after the\r\narrival of a regular governor, unless they had subsequently received\r\nthe royal confirmation. When a vacancy arose, it was the duty of the\r\nsenior magistrate to propose a candidate, but the actual filling\r\nof the place was to be effected by the acuerdo vote of the entire\r\naudiencia. [603]\r\n\r\nThe laws provided that the audiencia, as a body, should exercise\r\ntwo distinct types or classes of powers when in charge of the\r\ngovernment. These were designated as governmental and military. The\r\nexercise of these functions was assigned respectively to the audiencia\r\nas a body, and to the senior magistrate, individually. While an\r\neffort was made to insure the fair and equal participation of all\r\nin government in case of a vacancy, the senior magistrate assumed\r\nthe position and honors of the executive, though not granted all the\r\ngovernor's powers. [604] In the functions and duties of administration\r\nall the magistrates were to participate. As noted above, each\r\nwas to have a share in the exercise of the appointing power, the\r\nadministration of colonial finances, participation in the acuerdo,\r\nand in every other function except defense, which was entrusted to the\r\nsenior oidor. In this capacity, the oidor was always the most prominent\r\nfigure in the government. Among those who distinguished themselves\r\nthrough the exercise of this power were Rojas, Morga, Alcaraz, Bónifaz,\r\nColoma, Montemayor, and above all, Anda. Although these men were\r\nassisted and supported by their colleagues of the audiencia, and the\r\nparts played by the latter were not without importance, the periods\r\nof rule of the audiencia are always identified with the names of the\r\nsenior oidores, while those of the ordinary magistrates are forgotten.\r\n\r\nA complete understanding of the governmental functions and authority of\r\nthe audiencia, and the relation of the latter to the other departments\r\nof government under these conditions may best be obtained by a review\r\nof the circumstances and conditions of the audiencia's rule during\r\nvacancies in the Philippines. The first occasion which in any way\r\napproached the temporary rule of an audiencia in the Philippines was\r\nin 1593, after the murder of Governor Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas. Pedro\r\nde Rojas, who had been a magistrate of the audiencia when it was\r\nsuppressed in 1589, was at that time sole judge, with the additional\r\nrank of lieutenant-governor and asesor, standing next to the governor\r\nin authority. [605] After the death of Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas,\r\nRojas had occupied the governor's chair less than a year when he was\r\nsucceeded by the deceased governor's son, Luís Pérez Dasmariñas,\r\nwho became governor on the authority of a royal order found among\r\nthe papers of his father, whereby he was given the power to name\r\nhis successor. [606] His tenure seems to have been only temporary,\r\nhowever, for as soon as news reached the court of the death of the\r\nelder Dasmariñas, Francisco Tello de Guzmán was appointed permanent\r\ngovernor and an audiencia was sent to the Islands, arriving at Manila\r\nin 1596. [607] Meanwhile Rojas was succeeded as lieutenant-governor and\r\nasesor by Antonio de Morga. According to Montero y Vidal, Dasmariñas\r\nturned over the government to Morga in 1595, but it is more probable\r\nthat Morga assumed the temporary governorship when Dasmariñas was\r\nin Cambodia and elsewhere fighting against the Dutch. In fact,\r\nthis conclusion is confirmed by Zúñiga. [608] At any rate, Morga\r\nadministered both governmental and military affairs on several\r\noccasions when the various governors were absent from the Islands,\r\nengaged in expeditions of conquest.\r\n\r\nOn the suppression of the audiencia in 1589, the administration of\r\njustice remained entirely in the hands of the lieutenant-governor\r\nand asesor. This position was first occupied by Rojas, and later by\r\nMorga, who succeeded to the same judicial duties and enjoyed the same\r\nprerogatives as had formerly belonged to the audiencia. In the absence\r\nof the tribunal, therefore, they assumed functions which elsewhere\r\nwere carried out by the audiencia on the death of the governor or\r\nviceroy, partly because they had taken the place of the audiencia, and\r\npartly because they were lieutenants-governor. After the audiencia was\r\nre-established in 1598, Morga continued in charge of military affairs\r\nwhen the governor was absent or dead, while the audiencia administered\r\nthe government, not by virtue of any laws relating especially to the\r\nPhilippines, but seemingly because this was the general practice in\r\nall of Spain's colonies. Morga's defense of Manila against the Dutch\r\nin 1600 has been referred to in an earlier chapter.\r\n\r\nNot only did the audiencia do much in defense against outside enemies\r\nat this time, but it carried on offensive operations against them\r\nin the Moluccas after the deaths of Governors Tello and Acuña. The\r\nJapanese who were residing in the city also caused trouble, and the\r\naudiencia was under the necessity of taking repressive measures against\r\nthem. [609] In 1606, while Governor Acuña was absent from the colony,\r\nthe fortification of Cavite, the equipment of a fleet and the defense\r\nof the city were undertaken and carried out successfully by Oidor\r\nAlmansa. [610] Then on the death of Governor Acuña the audiencia\r\nsucceeded to the government and it managed affairs from June 24,\r\n1606, to June 15, 1608, with Almansa in charge of military affairs.\r\n\r\nThe various governmental matters with which the audiencia concerned\r\nitself during this period are shown in a memorial which it sent\r\nto the king on July 6, 1606. After reporting the death of Governor\r\nAcuña, and its succession to the government, the audiencia took up\r\nquestions of finance and commerce. It stated that the money in the\r\ntreasury was insufficient for the necessary expenses of the colony,\r\nowing to the extraordinary outlays which had been necessary to defray\r\nthe costs of the wars and expeditions which had been undertaken\r\nat this time. The audiencia suggested that the galleon returns be\r\nincreased from 500,000 to 1,000,000 pesos a year. It was pointed out\r\nin this connection that the total cost of transporting goods from\r\nManila to Acapulco, including freight and duty, aggregated thirty\r\nper cent of their value, leaving to the merchants a profit of only\r\n350,000 pesos. The oidores admitted that this arrangement might have\r\nbeen ample and satisfactory when the colony was small or when there\r\nwas peace, but at that time, when the inhabitants of the colony\r\nhad been forced to expend so much of their revenue for defense, a\r\nlarger return was necessary. [611] Further recommendations were made\r\nregarding commerce and the management of the galleons. It was said\r\nthat their great size encouraged smuggling; in order to avoid this,\r\nand at the same time to contribute to the revenues of the colony,\r\nit was urged that the ships should carry cargo to the limit of their\r\ncapacity, instead of being restricted to an insufficient amount. Large\r\nreductions of salaries of ships' officers, soldiers, and sailors were\r\nurged. The oidores did not think it advisable to forbid the crews and\r\nofficers of the galleons to trade, however, since their interest in\r\nthe cargo would encourage them to be obedient and loyal. [612] The\r\naudiencia concluded its memorial with an appeal for the reform of the\r\nfreight and customs charges on the galleon. The abolition of all fixed\r\nduties was recommended; instead, it was suggested that these duties\r\nbe graduated to meet the regular expenses of the colony as they were\r\nincurred year by year. This recommendation was made on the basis of\r\nthe theory that duties should not be levied for the benefit of the\r\nking's exchequer, but only for the support and maintenance of the\r\nmerchants and inhabitants of the colony. [613] This memorial would\r\nseem to indicate that the audiencia, when acting in the capacity\r\nof governor, exercised considerable authority and assumed entire\r\nresponsibility for the commercial and financial affairs of the colony.\r\n\r\nZúñiga, after describing the success of Oidor Almansa in putting down\r\nan insurrection of the Japanese, characterized the administration of\r\naffairs by the audiencia during this period as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Royal Audience conducted themselves with great approbation in\r\n    the civil administration, until the year 1608, when Don Rodrigo\r\n    Vivero of Laredo, who was named by the Viceroy as Governor ad\r\n    interim, arrived at Manila, and having had great experience in\r\n    the management of the Indians in New Spain, he availed himself\r\n    of it on this occasion, giving instructions to that effect to\r\n    the chief judges, and other ministers of justice. He governed\r\n    with much satisfaction for one year, when he delivered up the\r\n    insignia of his office, and returned to Mexico. [614]\r\n\r\n\r\nVivero arrived in the colony on June 15, 1608. Vivero was the first\r\nof the military governors appointed from New Spain. Under this and\r\nsucceeding arrangements, these governors exercised absolute control\r\nof military affairs, while the audiencia concerned itself solely\r\nwith matters of government, the senior magistrate, of course, not\r\nparticipating in military affairs.\r\n\r\nVivero was relieved in 1609 by Governor Juan de Silva, who had\r\na permanent appointment and served for seven years. Silva's\r\nadministration was characterized by his military exploits, chief\r\namong which was his defense of the colony against the attacks of the\r\nDutch pirate, Wittert, and subsequently of Spielberg. These frequent\r\nexpeditions gave the audiencia many opportunities to assume charge of\r\naffairs, and after Silva's death in the Moluccas the tribunal ruled\r\nfrom April 19, 1616, to June 8, 1619. During a part of this time\r\nAndrés de Alcaraz, the senior magistrate, exercised the duties of\r\ncaptain-general, successfully defending the city against the Dutch. On\r\nSeptember 30, 1617, the office of military governor devolved on\r\nGerónimo de Silva, who was especially designated for the post by the\r\nroyal order of March 20, 1616. [615] He was not an oidor, however,\r\nbut had served as governor of Ternate, having recently returned from\r\nthe Moluccas. [616]\r\n\r\nWhile the post of captain-general devolved upon Silva, the audiencia\r\nretained control of administrative affairs in the colony until Alonso\r\nFajardo y Tenza, the next royal appointee, arrived on June 8, 1618,\r\nto enter upon the duties of governor and captain-general. As we have\r\nalready seen, Alcaraz was relieved of his military responsibilities on\r\nSeptember 30, 1617, and was at once obliged to submit to residencia. In\r\nthis trial he was compelled to answer for his failure to warn the\r\nChinese traders, who usually approached the Islands at that time of\r\nthe year, of the presence of the Dutch. As a result of his oversight\r\nin this matter, a large quantity of merchandise, including provisions\r\nfor the city, had fallen into the hands of the enemy. He was also held\r\naccountable for the disaster which had occurred to a portion of the\r\nSpanish fleet in the battle of Playa Honda through the appointment of\r\nthe son of one of the oidores to its command. [617] Alcaraz, senior\r\noidor, who was legally responsible for defense, was compelled to\r\nanswer for the failure of this inefficient commander. The choice of\r\na relative of one of the oidores was a violation of the laws of the\r\nIndies. [618] Although Oidor Alcaraz seems to have acquitted himself\r\nwell of his duties as commander of the military forces, seven galleons\r\nwere lost in an expedition to the Moluccas during the rule of the\r\naudiencia, and considerable difficulty was experienced in fixing\r\nresponsibility for this disaster. Alcaraz claimed that Silva was\r\nanswerable; the latter maintained that the audiencia was to blame,\r\nand the audiencia disclaimed responsibility because, it alleged,\r\n\"the audiencia was entrusted with government and not war.\" In an\r\ninvestigation ultimately made in 1625, Silva was deprived of his\r\noffice and was prevented from leaving the Islands.\r\n\r\nGovernor Fajardo has left us a number of comments and criticisms of\r\nthe work of the audiencia as governor. His observations are timely and\r\nappropriate, since the tribunal had been in charge of the government\r\nfor two years preceding his rule, and he was brought intimately in\r\ntouch with the deeds and mistakes of the previous administration. [619]\r\nFajardo's comments relate to the abuse of the appointing power by the\r\naudiencia, and the failure of that body to provide adequately for the\r\ndefense of the colony. In support of the former charge, Fajardo said\r\nthat the magistrates had appointed several officials for life, which\r\nwas forbidden by the laws, since the audiencia was only permitted\r\nto fill offices for the period of its rule. [620] The audiencia had\r\nalso infringed upon the prerogatives of the governor by the permanent\r\nbestowal of encomiendas. Fajardo stated that when he arrived in the\r\nIslands he found all the offices and encomiendas filled with friends\r\nand dependents of the oidores. Thus as a direct consequence the success\r\nof his administration was impaired by the presence of officials who\r\nregarded him, their chief, with hostility. He cited an instance in\r\nwhich similar infringements upon the rights of the viceroy by the\r\nAudiencia of Mexico had been nullified by the royal veto, and he urged\r\nthat some definite cédula or law should be promulgated relative to\r\nthese matters in the Philippines. [621]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of fixing responsibility for the loss of the galleons\r\nin the expedition to the Moluccas led Fajardo to criticise the\r\npractice of allowing the audiencia to assume control of affairs\r\nduring vacancies. He regarded it as a cumbrous proceeding which could\r\nonly result in chaotic and incompetent government. No better results\r\ncould be expected when a body of magistrates and lawyers undertook\r\nto rule an isolated colony, and especially when one of them assumed\r\nresponsibility for military affairs, which could not be successfully\r\ncarried out by any but a military man. He emphasized the necessity of\r\nlocating responsibility for every department of government in a central\r\nauthority. He recommended the designation of \"two military men of such\r\nstanding and ability that, when the governor and captain-general is\r\nabsent, they might succeed to those duties.\" [622] He considered it\r\nadvisable that during vacancies, as well as when the regular governor\r\nwas present, authority should rest with one person and not be scattered\r\nor divided among a number of magistrates.\r\n\r\nGerónimo de Silva had been given a commission from the viceroy to\r\nassume the post of captain-general, and upon the demise of Fajardo in\r\n1624, he took charge of military affairs, while the audiencia retained\r\nthe government. Silva's responsibility for the loss of the ships in\r\n1617, already referred to, as well as for other disasters in 1624,\r\ncaused him to be removed from the command and confined in Fort Santiago\r\nwhere he remained until released by the new temporary governor,\r\nFernando de Silva, who arrived in 1625. The latter commanded the\r\nmilitary forces, while the audiencia administered the government. [623]\r\n\r\nOf far-reaching importance was the action of the audiencia in 1624, in\r\nnullifying the action taken by the former governor, Alonso Fajardo,\r\nrelative to the construction of a seminary for Japanese priests\r\nand students. This edifice had been partially constructed when the\r\naudiencia took over the government. It is interesting to note that\r\nthe oidores, although not collectively responsible for the defense\r\nof the colony, took a stand on this occasion in a matter which had\r\nto do with the common security. The objections of the oidores were\r\nsignificant. The location of the seminary within three hundred feet\r\nof the wall was thought to be unwise in view of the danger of a\r\nJapanese revolt. The Japanese emperor had signified his disapproval\r\nof Christianity on many occasions by banishing and torturing numerous\r\nfriars who had gone to Japan from the Islands. He had forbidden the\r\nworship and propagation of Christianity in his empire. There were at\r\nthat time rumors of an impending conquest of China and the Philippines\r\nby the Japanese, consequently the audiencia did not wish to invite\r\nthe emperor's wrath upon the colony by attempting to proselyte\r\nhis subjects. The audiencia thought best to stop this before the\r\ndispleasure and enmity of the Japanese were incurred. Fear of the\r\nloss of trade with China, dread of an alliance of the Japanese with\r\nthe Dutch, making probable a concerted attack on the Philippines,\r\nand the danger of an outbreak of the Japanese already within the\r\ncolony in conjunction with an attack by those without, were all\r\nconsiderations which induced the audiencia to take responsibility\r\nupon itself in this matter. [624]\r\n\r\nThe official correspondence of the governor following immediately\r\nupon the administration of an audiencia is always valuable as showing\r\nthe state of affairs under the preceding rule. That of Fernando de\r\nSilva coincides closely with the correspondence of Governor Fajardo\r\nin charging the audiencia with many misdeeds, chief among which were\r\nthe abuse of the appointing power and the concession of encomiendas\r\nwithout authorization. Silva, on his accession to the governorship,\r\nalso found the finances of the colony in a bad condition, great waste\r\nhaving been incurred in their administration. There had been neither\r\npeace nor order; the oidores had quarreled among themselves, and\r\nresidents were leaving the city as a consequence of this turmoil. The\r\noidores had, without cause, dismissed all the officials appointed by\r\nFajardo, filling their places with their friends. [625] The following\r\naccount of the excesses of the audiencia was given by Silva:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Under pretext of the arrest and removal of Don Geronimo de Silva,\r\n    Licentiate Legaspi, ... exercised the office of captain-general,\r\n    carrying the staff of office and making them lower the banners\r\n    to him, and address him as \"your Lordship,\" and his wife as\r\n    \"my lady.\" He immediately appointed his elder son to the post of\r\n    sargento-mayor of this camp, and his younger son to a company,\r\n    while another company was assigned to a relative of Auditor Matias\r\n    Flores y Cassila (also an oidor). Others were assigned to brothers\r\n    of the said Don Matias, the fiscal, and other auditors, except\r\n    Don Albaro (Messa y Lugo), who refused to have anything given to\r\n    his household. Upon seeing the illegality of these appointments,\r\n    I issued an act declaring them vacant and restoring those posts\r\n    to those who had held them before. [626]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the king had not entirely lost confidence in the audiencia,\r\nnotwithstanding the above complaints, is attested by the instruction\r\nissued by the Council of the Indies to Francisco de Rojas y Ornate,\r\nroyal visitor to the Philippines. [627] This communication, which was\r\ndated August 17, 1628, approved the stand which the audiencia had taken\r\nin insisting that all money obtained from Chinese trading-licenses\r\nshould be put into the royal treasury and accounted for by the\r\noficiales reales before it was spent. It appears that the governor\r\nhad hitherto used this money as an extra fund upon which to draw for\r\nthe expenses of the colony. The king also approved the attitude of\r\nthe audiencia in denying to persons in New Spain the right of using\r\nthe Manila galleon for the shipment of their goods, and in refusing to\r\nallow money sent by them to the Islands to be invested in the Chinese\r\ntrade. Silva contended that the audiencia had no right to intervene\r\nin either of the above matters, but in this Silva was not sustained,\r\nRojas y Ornate being instructed to see that Governor Tavora respected\r\nthe action of the audiencia in the two particulars referred to. [628]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia assumed management of political affairs in 1632, on\r\nthe death of Governor Juan Niño de Tavora, but neither the audiencia\r\nas a body, nor the senior oidor personally were entrusted with the\r\nmilitary command. This responsibility devolved on Lorenzo de Olazo,\r\nthe maestre de campo, who had been designated by the viceroy of New\r\nSpain to assume temporary charge of military affairs. He was succeeded\r\nthe following year by Juan Cerezo de Salamanca, who had been sent from\r\nMexico by the viceroy as soon as the death of Tavora was announced in\r\nthat city. Cerezo served ad interim for three years, and during his\r\nadministration the audiencia acted solely as a judicial body, not\r\nattempting to interfere in governmental or military affairs. [629]\r\nIt was under the rule of this governor that important expeditions\r\nwere undertaken against the Moros in the South, and the first fort\r\nand settlement were made at Zamboanga.\r\n\r\nIt is to be especially noted that in the appointment of Olazo and\r\nCerezo in 1632 and 1633 respectively, the senior oidor was deprived\r\nof the control of military affairs. This had been done also in\r\n1617 and in 1624 when Gerónimo de Silva, governor of Ternate, had\r\ntaken charge of military affairs during vacancies in the regular\r\ngovernorship. Temporary appointments had been made on two different\r\noccasions by the Marqués de Cerralbo, Viceroy of New Spain, once in\r\nthe sending of Fernando de Silva after the death of Governor Fajardo,\r\nand on this occasion, when Cerezo de Salamanca took the place of\r\nGovernor Juan Niño de Tavora, after the audiencia had governed\r\na year. Experience had shown that the assumption of the military\r\ncommand by the senior oidor was not productive of the most satisfactory\r\nresults. It was not to be expected, of course, that a magistrate would\r\nadminister military affairs with the skill of a captain-general, and\r\nwe have seen that various governors recommended that the practice\r\nshould no longer be continued. So it came about that the law of\r\n1608 was revived, and the viceroy appointed a temporary governor to\r\nassume control of military affairs, the audiencia being restricted\r\nto judicial and administrative functions. In 1633, on the accession\r\nof Cerezo de Salamanca, the audiencia was deprived of the right of\r\nintervention in the last mentioned activity, and was confined to its\r\njudicial duties alone. This was confirmed by the cédula of January\r\n30, 1635, which relieved the Audiencia of Manila of all jurisdiction\r\nover military affairs during vacancies, ordering that they were to\r\nbe administered by a temporary appointee of the viceroy. [630]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, considerable opposition to this method of filling\r\nvacancies in the governorship had developed within the colony. This\r\nis shown in various protests which came from the Islands from time\r\nto time. These are set forth with great clarity in the correspondence\r\nof the governors. Corcuera, in a letter written to Philip IV on June\r\n30, 1636, stated that these temporary governors had allowed persons\r\nin Mexico to make large fortunes out of the Philippine trade, and\r\nthat the governors had devoted most of their time when in Manila to\r\nserving as agents of the residents of Mexico. Corcuera, however,\r\nseemed to regard the audiencia as incapable of government, for he\r\nclaimed that in the brief term of a year in which the tribunal had\r\nruled, three years prior to his accession, it had run the colony into\r\ndebt from 80,000 to 100,000 pesos. He charged the oidores with the\r\nsame dishonest practice as had been alleged against Governor Fajardo,\r\nnamely, that they had issued due-bills in payment of debts and had\r\nbought them up later at less than their face value, realizing the\r\nfull amount on them upon their presentation to the treasury later. He\r\nstated that these warrants were not only bought by the oidores, but\r\nby practically all the officials of the government. During Cerezo's\r\nterm a sum in excess of 100,000 pesos was said to have been paid out\r\nto officials as usury. [631]\r\n\r\nCorcuera presented a scheme of reform designed to remedy the evils\r\nresulting from the succession either of the audiencia or of an\r\nirresponsible military commander to the ad interim governorship. He\r\nrecommended that the regularly appointed governor should be assisted\r\nby five commissioners, who should be military men, holding the\r\nrespective commands of Fort Santiago, Cavite, the Port of Manila,\r\nFormosa, and the Parián. These were to be eligible in the order named\r\nin case of a vacancy. This plan, like so many of the schemes of the\r\nsoldier governors, only took cognizance of the military side of the\r\ngovernor's office. The marked tendency of these commanders was to\r\ncontinually underestimate the administrative and political phases\r\nof their positions. The plan of Corcuera was not adopted, however,\r\nand the viceroy continued to appoint temporary governors to succeed\r\nthe audiencia when it assumed the government ad interim.\r\n\r\nGovernor Diego Fajardo, on July 10, 1651, wrote a letter to the\r\nking protesting against the policy of appointment which was then in\r\nforce. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I should be unfaithful to Your Majesty if I did not advise you\r\n    of the inconveniences arising from the appointment of governors\r\n    by the Viceroy of New Spain; the practice of sending money from\r\n    Mexico for investment in this colony has continued and increased,\r\n    to the exclusion and deprivation of the merchants of these\r\n    Islands.... Investments have been made by the viceroys through\r\n    the agency of others. [632]\r\n\r\n\r\nFajardo urged that the audiencia should be permitted to retain the\r\ngovernment as it had done formerly. He showed the advantages accruing\r\nto the colony from a continuity of policy which would result from the\r\nrule of the oidores. He showed that the incursions of the viceroys\r\nand residents of Mexico upon the galleon trade would more likely be\r\nchecked by the oidores than by any other agency, adding moreover that\r\nthis particular matter should be attended to at once since the life and\r\nprosperity of the colony depended on the control of the Acapulco and\r\nChinese commerce by the merchants of Manila. [633] A similar argument\r\nwas presented by Governor Manrique de Lara in a letter written July 19,\r\n1654. This governor urged that a commission of magistrates, familiar\r\nwith the needs of the colony through experience and long residence, was\r\nbetter fitted to rule for the common good than a stranger, appointed\r\nby a distant viceroy, coming to the Islands as most of the temporary\r\ngovernors had done, with the sole purpose of exploitation. [634]\r\n\r\nProbably the sentiments of the residents and officials of the\r\nPhilippines were best and most effectively expressed on this subject in\r\nthe letter written by the audiencia to the king on July 19, 1654. [635]\r\nThe audiencia, on this occasion, described the inconveniences\r\nresulting from the appointment of a resident of the Islands by the\r\nViceroy of New Spain. It was alleged that these appointees, being\r\nalready established in the Islands as merchants, officials, lawyers,\r\nand even as soldiers, spent all their time in the service of their\r\nown special interests. The commercial abuses of these appointees were\r\nsaid to be notorious. The presence of so many relatives, friends, and\r\nbusiness connections made it impossible for these temporary rulers to\r\nofficiate properly as presidents of the audiencia, or to administer\r\nthe affairs of the government with diligence and impartiality.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the general dissatisfaction in the colony, which was\r\nreflected in the above letters, and in compliance with the repeated\r\nrequests previously made for reform, the law of April 2, 1664, was\r\nproclaimed, and followed by the consulta of September 9, 1669, which\r\nhas been already referred to. These laws still recognized the right of\r\nthe Viceroy of New Spain to appoint governors temporarily, but these\r\nwere no longer to be designated in advance from the residents of the\r\nIslands. While the senior magistrate was to have charge of military\r\naffairs, he was to seek the advice of such military officials as\r\nwere stationed in the colony, \"exercising very particular care and\r\nvigilance in all that pertains to military affairs, endeavoring to\r\nkeep the presidios well stocked and provided with all the defenses\r\nnecessary for whatever occasion may arise.\" This, then, was a return\r\nto the practice which had prevailed prior to September 13, 1608,\r\nwhen the Viceroy of New Spain was first authorized to appoint a\r\ntemporary governor in advance of the death of the incumbent. Although\r\nthe audiencia assumed the government with partial legal justification\r\nfrom 1593 onward, the period from 1664 to 1719 may rightly be said\r\nto constitute the era of the audiencia's authorized rule.\r\n\r\nAn occasion for the exercise of the new law occurred in 1668,\r\nwhen Governor Diego de Salcedo was arrested and imprisoned by the\r\ncommissary of the Inquisition. In accordance with the law of April\r\n2, 1664, just referred to, the audiencia was entitled to assume the\r\ngovernment until the arrival of the provisional governor from New\r\nSpain. A dispute arose between the two most eligible oidores, Francisco\r\nde Coloma and Francisco Montemayor y Mansilla, for the honors of the\r\nmilitary command. Coloma had been commissioned as magistrate of the\r\nAudiencia of Manila before Montemayor, who maintained his claim to the\r\nheadship of military affairs on the grounds that he had arrived in\r\nthe Philippines earlier than Coloma. [636] These two officials were\r\nunable to agree as to their respective rights, and Juan Manuel de la\r\nPeña Bónifaz, junior magistrate of the audiencia, took advantage of\r\nthe discord to further his own interests. Put forward by the commissary\r\nof the Inquisition and by the ecclesiastical element of the colony as\r\narbiter in the contention between his two colleagues, he solidified\r\nhis own power until he was able to usurp the entire government. He\r\nissued orders to the soldiers, compromised with Coloma, exiled\r\nMontemayor, enacted financial and governmental measures, appointed\r\nhis friends to office, and in general acted the part of a dictator,\r\ncombining in his own person all the functions of the military,\r\njudicial and executive departments. [637] The audiencia, of course,\r\nwas entirely suppressed. Certain ecclesiastical authorities state\r\nthat he governed with greater consideration and fairness than many\r\nof his predecessors, and that his rule was more just than that of\r\nthe audiencia had been. [638] The spirit of his administration was\r\nparticularly favorable to the churchmen, by whose favor he gained\r\noffice, and by whose aid he was able to retain his position. His\r\nsuccessor, Manuel de León, was appointed regular governor as soon as\r\nnews of the arrest of Salcedo reached Spain. Bónifaz was apprehended\r\nand sentenced to pay the customary penalty for treason, but death\r\nintervened and defrauded the king's justice. It may be considered, in\r\na sense, that Bónifaz conferred a service upon the colony by forcibly\r\nputting an end to the disputes which had been prevalent between the\r\nrival oidores whose claims could not have been settled for three\r\nyears at least--the time necessary for the Council of the Indies to\r\ntransmit to the distant colony a ruling on the points at issue.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia next took over the government in April, 1679, on the\r\ndeath of Governor León, and it retained control of affairs until the\r\narrival of Governor Juan de Vargas Hurtado in September, 1678. The\r\nrule of the tribunal on this occasion was without sensational\r\nfeatures. Oidor Francisco de Coloma, in whose favor the Council of\r\nthe Indies had declared in the dispute described above, assumed charge\r\nof military affairs, serving as captain-general until his death. His\r\nseniority was acknowledged by Montemayor, who was called back from\r\nexile to a place in the audiencia. [639]\r\n\r\nThe inefficiency of the audiencia as a governing agency as shown\r\nin the episode just described was surpassed by the state of utter\r\nimpotency to which the tribunal was reduced during the Pardo\r\ncontroversy in 1684. Though at first successful in exiling the\r\narchbishop, the audiencia and Governor Vargas were later completely\r\nundone by the intriguing of the new governor, Curuzaelegui, with\r\nthe prelate to discredit the previous administration. The struggle\r\nended in the restoration of the prelate, the residencia of Vargas\r\nand the appointment of a new tribunal which was calculated to be more\r\nsubservient to the commands of the new governor and the prelate. This\r\naudiencia assumed the government after the death of Curuzaelegui on\r\nApril 17, 1689, with Alonzo de Ávila as chief executive. [640]\r\n\r\nThe events of the Pardo controversy prepared the way for a period of\r\nrule by an audiencia in which the entire government was dominated\r\nby the ecclesiastics. Archbishop Pardo and his successors were\r\nthe real governors and the victory of the church over the various\r\nofficials of civil administration lowered the moral tone of the entire\r\ngovernment. Corruption flourished and the vigor of the administration\r\ndecayed. [641] It is clear that the depravity of the civil government\r\nproceeded largely from the weakness of the audiencia and its submission\r\nto the governor. The latter was under orders from no less an authority\r\nthan the king, himself, to put an end to the disputes between church\r\nand state in the colony and to bring about peace; it also happened\r\nthat the situation in the colony at that time caused the governor to\r\nlean towards the side of Pardo and his supporters. The audiencia was\r\nentirely disregarded both by Governor Curuzaelegui and by the court,\r\nwhich may be attributed in some measure to that policy of the Spanish\r\ngovernment previously alluded to--that of sacrificing principle in\r\norder to preserve harmony. There is no doubt but that the weakness\r\nand inefficiency of the audiencia during these two controversies\r\ncontributed largely to the subsequent decision of the court to deprive\r\nthe audiencia of the right of governing ad interim.\r\n\r\nThe last occasion on which the audiencia regularly assumed the\r\ngovernment of the Islands, and one which demonstrated still more\r\nconclusively the inefficiency of the audiencia as governor, occurred\r\nin 1715, after the death of Governor Lizarraga. His rule had been\r\nuncommonly quiet and peaceful, and the period of extortion and strife\r\nwhich succeeded it furnished a marked contrast to that governor's\r\nadministration. The audiencia ruled from February 4, 1715, to August\r\n9, 1717, with Oidor José Torralba as senior magistrate. The reports\r\nsent by Torralba to the court during the two years of his service\r\nas military commander show that the audiencia as a body played a\r\nvery small part in the government. This was again the rule of a\r\ndictator. We have seen in a former chapter that Torralba was held\r\naccountable in his residencia for a deficit of 700,000 pesos which\r\ndeveloped during this period; [642] it is difficult to understand\r\nhow this could have been possible had the senior magistrate concerned\r\nhimself solely with military affairs. Concepción states that Torralba,\r\ninflated by his position, and ambitious of getting absolute control\r\nof the government, drove from office the oidores who dared to oppose\r\nhim. [643] He refused to honor the royal cédula of April 15, 1713,\r\nwhich ordered the reinstatement of Oidor Pavón to his place as senior\r\noidor since the fulfillment of this order would have deprived Torralba\r\nof his command.\r\n\r\nTorralba reported great progress in the repair and restoration of\r\nroyal and municipal warehouses, hospitals, convents, and churches\r\nduring his administration. The wall of Manila was re-built and new\r\nbronze guns were cast and placed thereon. As acting captain-general,\r\nTorralba inspected Fort Santiago, and, \"noting grave needs both\r\nin construction and in the morale of troops,\" made the necessary\r\nrepairs, reforms and corrections. [644] He concerned himself also\r\nwith the promotion and appointment of military officials. These\r\nlatter acts were vigorously resisted by the maestre de campo, and by\r\nother military officials, as encroachments on their authority. They\r\nultimately sought to bring about the nullification of all Torralba's\r\n\"unjustifiable acts of interference within the military sphere.\" [645]\r\nWhether animated by a sincere desire to see the natives justly treated,\r\nor rather by his natural dislike of the friars, Torralba intervened\r\non various occasions for the protection of the Indians against the\r\nencroachments and abuses of the churchmen on the encomiendas and\r\nin the native towns. These acts were carried out in the name of the\r\naudiencia, and in accordance with the law, ultimately meeting with\r\nthe approval of the Council of the Indies. [646]\r\n\r\nA great deal of dissatisfaction, both at the court and in the colony,\r\nhad resulted from the audiencia's assumption of the government at\r\nvarious times since 1664. We have already noted that the restoration\r\nof this authority to the audiencia was attended by the disgraceful\r\nquarrel between Coloma and Montemayor and the usurpation of Bónifaz in\r\n1668. The Pardo controversy did not produce a favorable impression of\r\nthe activities of the audiencia. Torralba's dictatorship in the name\r\nof the audiencia from 1715 to 1717, conspicuous for the huge deficit\r\nin which it culminated, demonstrated the unfitness of the audiencia\r\nto be entrusted with the rule of the Islands.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it may be said that the various experiments made by the\r\nmonarchs during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries for\r\nthe purpose of perfecting a system whereby the governorship could\r\nbe satisfactorily filled ad interim had failed to demonstrate or\r\ndevelop any authority capable of maintaining harmony or decent\r\ngovernment. Co-operation among the authorities of the colony was\r\npractically unknown. The royal disapproval was passed upon practically\r\nall the official acts of these interim administrations. The thirst\r\nfor personal glory, and the desire for private gain invariably\r\ninduced some official who was stronger than his contemporaries to\r\nassume control of affairs; thus the government of the colony was made\r\nrepeatedly to subserve personal ends, and civil and political life\r\nwas characterized by its strife and discord. The probabilities that\r\nthe temporary administration of the audiencia would not be entirely\r\nsuccessful had been recognized from the beginning, and in order to\r\nguard against its misrule the king had authorized the appointment of\r\na temporary governor by the Viceroy of New Spain. It was unavoidable,\r\nhowever, that the audiencia should govern until the arrival of this\r\nofficial. For a time the alternative was tried of allowing the maestre\r\nde campo to assume the military command, but this resulted in such an\r\nincompetent rule that the former prerogatives of the audiencia were\r\nrestored. Whether the audiencia was capable of governing successfully\r\nor not, it certainly had the power to make or mar the government of\r\nany other person or authority, whether he was regularly appointed by\r\nthe king, or chosen temporarily by the viceroy.\r\n\r\nThe church, as represented by a succession of triumphant archbishops,\r\nhad exercised the preponderance of power and authority throughout the\r\nforty years of strife, ending with the death of Governor Bustamante. We\r\nneed not be concerned here with the various struggles and disagreements\r\nwith governors and audiencias, but the fact remains that the church\r\nwas the only institution existing during this period which was able to\r\npresent a solid and united front to its enemies, or which manifested\r\nany symptoms of power, unity or royal approbation. The culmination\r\nof ecclesiastical power was virtually reached on October 11, 1719,\r\nwhen Governor Bustamante was murdered by emissaries of the church\r\nand Fray Francisco de la Cuesta, Archbishop of Manila, assumed the\r\nvacant governorship.\r\n\r\nZúñiga, the Dominican historian, says that the archbishop declined the\r\ngovernorship on this occasion, but was subsequently prevailed upon\r\nto accept it. [647] It is certain that the tribunal was in no state\r\nor condition to take charge of affairs; its administration had been\r\ndiscredited by the murder of its protector, its senior magistrate had\r\nbeen proved an embezzler in his residencia, and the remaining members\r\nof the tribunal were not qualified to remain in office. Oidores\r\nVilla and Pavón, removed by Torralba and Bustamante, were restored\r\nby the archbishop, and were content to recognize him as president\r\nof the audiencia. Each of them had his own claims to the position of\r\nacting-governor and had Cuesta not occupied the governorship with their\r\nconsent, these oidores would either have been languishing in banishment\r\nas punishment for having resisted the prelate, or they would have\r\nbeen struggling for the honors of a position occupied by a pretended\r\nmediator, as on former occasions. So there can be no doubt that it\r\nwas best for all concerned that the church was powerful at this time;\r\nthe colony had had enough of strife and murder and there was urgent\r\nneed of some authority with sufficient power to bring about peace. It\r\nis sufficient to say that the audiencia renounced its claims to the\r\ngovernment, and, according to Zúñiga, who devotes an unusual amount\r\nof space to this important epoch in the ecclesiastical history of the\r\nIslands, the people were very content with the archbishop's rule after\r\nthe injustice and oppression of Bustamante. [648] It may be noted that\r\nthe archbishop exercised complete authority over the audiencia, even\r\nto the extent of restoring oidores who had been unlawfully dismissed,\r\nand of acting as an intermediary between magistrates. He was master\r\nof the situation and his interim rule was preferred by the sovereign\r\nand by the people to that of the audiencia.\r\n\r\nThe royal order of September 8, 1720, legalizing the government of\r\nthe prelates, applied not only to the administration of Cuesta, but it\r\nestablished a precedent for the temporary rule of four prelates. [649]\r\nIn compliance with this decree, three sealed envelopes (pliegos de\r\nprovidencia) were sent to the audiencia to be placed unopened in\r\nthe archives of that tribunal, and the seals were to be broken only\r\non the death of the governor. These envelopes were accompanied by an\r\norder from the king, directing that the person mentioned in the first\r\nenvelope should be recognized as temporary governor. In case of his\r\nabsence or incapacity to serve, the second envelope was to be opened\r\nand the directions contained therein were to be followed, and if\r\nthese could not be complied with, the third envelope was to be opened.\r\n\r\nNo further necessity for the observance of this law of succession\r\narose until after the death of Governor Gaspar de la Torre, when,\r\non August 15, 1745, the first envelope was opened in the presence of\r\nthe audiencia. The post of archbishop being vacant at this time it\r\nbecame necessary to follow the directions prescribed by the second\r\nenvelope. It was found that Fray Juan de Arrechedera, Bishop of\r\nNueva Segovia, had been designated as the governor's successor. The\r\naudiencia relinquished the control of affairs into his hands and he\r\ngoverned for a period of five years.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the ecclesiastical calling of this governor in no\r\nway incapacitated or hindered him in the execution of his duties. His\r\nadministration was characterized especially by various measures taken\r\nfor the defense and fortification of the Islands. He suppressed several\r\ninsurrections in Ilocos and Cagayán, dispatching military forces under\r\nthe command of alcaldes mayores against the revolting natives. He\r\nrepelled several Moro raids and made treaties of peace with the Sultan\r\nof Sulu. [650] There is no evidence of discord between the governor and\r\nthe audiencia during this period. Although Archbishop Trinidad arrived\r\nand took possession of his see on August 27, 1747, he made no attempt\r\nto take charge of political affairs. [651] He permitted Arrechedera\r\nto continue as governor for three years, handing over to him\r\n\r\n\r\n    a royal mandate, for the absolute expulsion of the Chinese\r\n    [which was never] ... carried into execution, the interest of\r\n    the Governor being too deeply involved in the suspension of it,\r\n    the Chinese paying him a contribution for his forbearance. The\r\n    Archbishop found that Arrechedera was strongly attached to this\r\n    nation, and he became so far a convert to his sentiments on this\r\n    subject that he did not put the royal order in force.... This\r\n    seems to have been the only error committed by this illustrious\r\n    prelate during the time he held the government. In all other\r\n    respects his conduct reflected the highest honour on him. [652]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third time the government was taken over by a prelate was in 1759\r\non the death of Governor Arandía. On this occasion it became necessary\r\nto open the third pliego de providencia. The metropolitan see of Manila\r\nand the diocese of Nueva Segovia being vacant, Bishop Espeleta of Cebú\r\nwas the senior prelate of the Islands. Shortly after the accession\r\nof Espeleta, Manuel Rojo, the new archbishop, arrived, commanding\r\nEspeleta to vacate the governorship at once. Rojo refused, citing the\r\nprecedent established by Bishop Arrechedera. Espeleta appealed to the\r\naudiencia for support, but the oidores were unable to agree on the\r\nquestion, two of them, Calderón and Galbán supporting Rojo, and the\r\nother two remaining in favor of the retention of the governorship by\r\nEspeleta. The question was left to the fiscal, Francisco Leandro de\r\nViana, who advised that the matter should be carried to the Council\r\nof the Indies for final settlement. [653] It transpired, therefore,\r\nthat Espeleta retained the governorship from 1759 until 1761, and he\r\ndid very effective work in repelling the raids of the Moros, who had\r\nbeen ravaging the provinces with impunity for some time.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of Dr. Santiago Orendaín occupied a large share of\r\nEspeleta's attention during his administration. This controversy\r\nshould be noted here because it illustrates the relations between\r\nthe audiencia and an ecclesiastical governor. Orendaín had been\r\nthe advisor (asesor) of Governor Arandía, and was held responsible\r\nfor the repressive measures taken against the church during the\r\nadministration of the latter. The rule of an unscrupulous prelate\r\npresented an excellent opportunity for revenge and Orendaín's\r\nprosecution was unanimously demanded by the ecclesiastical element of\r\nthe colony. The magistrates also welcomed the opportunity to retaliate\r\nupon a hitherto successful, but unpopular, rival. The fiscal brought\r\naction against Orendaín, who sought refuge in an Augustinian convent,\r\nwhereupon the civil authorities forced an entrance into the asylum,\r\nseizing Orendaín and imprisoning him in Fort Santiago. The provisor\r\nof the ecclesiastical court excommunicated Magistrate Villacorta,\r\nwho had exculpated Orendaín in his trial, but the ban was disregarded\r\nby the audiencia. A division over the question arose in the tribunal,\r\nand matters were assuming a threatening aspect, when the authorized\r\nappointment of Governor Rojo arrived. Espeleta gave up his office,\r\nand the first act of the new governor was to restore Orendaín to full\r\nfavor as his counsellor. The affair of Dr. Orendaín illustrates a phase\r\nof Spanish colonial administration which is too characteristic to be\r\nleft unnoticed here. Aside from the influence which Orendaín exercised\r\nover Governor Arandía, his persecution shows the measure of personal\r\nrancour which even a prelate might put into his administration,\r\nspending practically two years in the pursuit of revenge. In this he\r\nwas supported by the audiencia. In this affair neither the church nor\r\nthe audiencia were animated so much by motives of right and justice\r\nas they were influenced by personal feelings.\r\n\r\nThe rule of Archbishop Rojo from 1761 to 1764 was a notable one\r\nin the history of the Philippines. The principal event during\r\nhis administration was the capture of Manila by the British. This\r\nfurnished the occasion for the resistance of Oidor Simón de Anda y\r\nSalazar, in the name of the audiencia, both to the English and to\r\nthe archbishop who had ordered his surrender. These events show\r\nthe complete incapacity of an ecclesiastical governor of Rojo's\r\ntype and personality to fulfill the military requirements of his\r\nposition. In the operations of Anda we note how a man of decisive\r\naction, energy, courage, and loyalty was able to force the issue and\r\ndeprive the archbishop-governor of the executive functions which\r\nhe had assumed legally, but which he was unable to dispense. This\r\nepisode illustrates, furthermore, the general disregard of the laws\r\nwhich placed the governorship in the hands of a man who was unfit\r\nfor its exercise, showing again that in the selection of a person to\r\ncarry out the duties of governor the military side of the situation\r\ncould not be disregarded.\r\n\r\nAnda, at the time of the accession of Rojo, was a junior magistrate\r\nin the audiencia, having arrived in Manila on July 21, 1761. [654]\r\nThe British squadron entered Manila Bay on September 22, 1762. The\r\nBritish subsequently attacked the city, the fall of which seemed\r\nimminent on account of the neglectful state into which the defense had\r\nfallen. [655] The proposition was made to the archbishop-governor by\r\nFiscal Francisco Leandro de Viana and the audiencia that Oidor Anda\r\nshould be dispatched to the provinces with the title of Governor\r\nand Captain-general of the Islands for the purpose of maintaining\r\nand defending them under the sovereignty of the Spanish monarch,\r\n[656] and \"in order that he might keep the natives quiet in their\r\nChristian instruction and in their obedience to the king.\" [657] The\r\narchbishop refused to accede to this proposition on the grounds that\r\n\"neither he nor the Audiencia had any authority to create a governor\r\nand captain-general, which was the proper privilege of his Majesty;\r\nand that it was enough to give him the title of visitor of the land\r\n... and ... of lieutenant of the captain-general.\" [658] This was done,\r\ntherefore, and Anda left on the night of October 3, 1762, with these\r\ntitles and powers.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that Anda was not given the title of governor\r\nand captain-general, but that as oidor he was commissioned visitador\r\nde tierras and teniente de gobernador y capitán general. [659] The\r\nauthority to designate oidores as visitors of the provinces was\r\na function regularly exercised by the president of the audiencia\r\nand authorized by the laws of the Indies. [660] It appears from the\r\nabove that Anda was sent to the provinces to defend them against the\r\nEnglish. This was the main object as stated in the original proposition\r\nof the audiencia. Zúñiga states the purpose of the departure of Anda to\r\nhave been \"to maintain the islands in obedience to the King of Spain,\"\r\n[661] and this is corroborated by the testimonies of Anda, [662]\r\nViana [663] and of Rojo, [664] himself. In view of these facts, Rojo's\r\nfailure to co-operate with Anda, his proneness to listen to those who\r\ncounseled surrender, his complete reversal of tactics in repeatedly\r\nsummoning Anda to abdicate, and his willingness even to betray Anda\r\ninto the hands of the British are almost inexplicable. [665]\r\n\r\nAnda organized a provisional government in his capacity as\r\nlieutenant-governor. He disregarded the repeated summons of the\r\narchbishop to return to the city and surrender to the British. In\r\na letter to the archbishop, dated October 21, 1762, Anda justified\r\nhis position and made clear that he was not acting on the basis\r\nof any delegation of power as captain-general, which authority,\r\nhe acknowledged, still rested with Rojo. He stated that he had been\r\nappointed visitor-general of the provinces \"with the real mission\r\nof protecting them if the English captured Manila;\" in case this\r\nhappened he was to solicit the aid of prelates, religious and alcaldes\r\nmayores in defending the Islands. He complained that Rojo had already\r\n\"endeavored to influence the prelates, religious and natives to\r\nsubmit to the British.\" [666] He urged that Rojo should desist from\r\nhis opposition to his efforts, pointing out the great desirability\r\nof their co-operation.\r\n\r\nWhen Anda became convinced of the infirmity of Rojo and the uselessness\r\nof further attempts at co-operation with him he completely changed\r\nhis attitude towards his own position and towards the question of the\r\ndefense and government of the Islands. While he had hitherto recognized\r\nRojo as governor and captain-general, he now assumed the position that\r\nthe archbishop was a prisoner in the city and he therefore refused to\r\nrecognize the orders of the latter. Anda issued a call to all loyal\r\ninhabitants to defend the honor of Spain. He ordered the alcaldes\r\nmayores to pay no heed to the dispatches and commands issued by the\r\narchbishop or the British in the city. He set himself up as governor\r\nand captain-general of the Islands, subsequently moving his capital\r\nto Bacolor, Pampanga. He obtained possession of the funds of the\r\nroyal treasury, which had been sent to the province of Laguna when\r\nthe English had appeared, and he turned a deaf ear to the demands of\r\nthe archbishop that the money should be returned to the city in order\r\nthat it might be applied on the payment of the four million-peso war\r\nindemnity imposed by the victorious British. Anda enlisted a military\r\nforce aggregating eight thousand men, and he successfully prevented\r\nthe enemy from doing more than capture Cavite, Pásig, and a few other\r\nplaces of minor importance. Notwithstanding the demands of the British,\r\nwho had placed a price of four thousand pesos on his head, and the\r\nentreaties of the archbishop, Anda resisted until he was assured that\r\npeace was definitely arranged between Spain and Great Britain. [667]\r\n\r\nThe justification which Anda offered for his conduct was as follows:\r\nthe regular governor and the audiencia (excepting himself) were\r\nprisoners in the city of Manila; their positions and places\r\nwere therefore vacant, and Anda, as the sole oidor who was not\r\nincapacitated, should accordingly succeed and had succeeded to the\r\nmanagement of political affairs and defense. He was both audiencia\r\nand governor. In support of his contention that he himself was the\r\nlegally constituted audiencia, he cited the law promulgated by Philip\r\nIII on August 14, 1620, declaring that \"in some of the audiencias\r\nof the Indies it has happened, and it might happen still that the\r\noidores being absent and ... only one remaining, ... in such cases the\r\naudiencia is to be conserved and continued with only one oidor.\" [668]\r\nAnda had been a legally appointed oidor on special delegation to\r\nthe provinces when the city fell into the hands of the British;\r\nthe governor and the remaining oidores had become prisoners and\r\nwere civilly dead; being the only magistrate of the audiencia yet on\r\nduty, he was at once audiencia and governor. He stated that he would\r\nsurrender his office to the archbishop and audiencia when both had\r\nregained their liberty, but he warned the archbishop that if he went\r\nto the extreme of surrendering the Islands, he (Anda) \"would in no\r\nwise obey so unjust and absurd a treaty,\" and furthermore stated that\r\nif the British wished to rule the country, they would have to conquer\r\nit first. He expressed the conviction that neither the archbishop nor\r\nany other authority except the king had the power to surrender the\r\nIslands. [669] In these arguments and sentiments Anda was supported\r\nby the fiscal, Francisco Leandro de Viana, and by Oidores Galbán and\r\nVillacorta, who subsequently escaped from the city and joined him in\r\nthe provinces, aiding him in his resistance to the invaders.\r\n\r\nAlthough the British had agreed in their terms of capitulation that\r\nthe audiencia should continue in the exercise of its normal powers\r\nin Manila, [670] that tribunal and the archbishop were virtually\r\nprisoners; the idea of their recognition therefore appears almost\r\nan absurdity. The oidores acted as members of the council of\r\nwar which considered the proposition made by the British for the\r\nsurrender of the city, but if we may trust the testimony of Viana,\r\nthe archbishop, influenced by his favorites, Monroy and Orendaín,\r\nforced the magistrates to sign the articles of capitulation. Viana\r\nsays that in the various matters which came up for solution after the\r\ncity had surrendered, the oidores were formally consulted, but the\r\narchbishop followed his own counsel, or that of his favorites. [671]\r\n\r\nThe position of Rojo after the escape of the fiscal and the oidores\r\nwas an exceedingly unpleasant one. The English commander complained\r\nthat the prelate and the audiencia had failed to keep the agreement\r\nwhich had been made between them; in escaping, the fiscal and the\r\noidores had violated their oaths; the indemnity had not been paid;\r\nthe provinces had not surrendered and Anda was still continuing his\r\nresistance. The sack of the city was threatened. These conditions made\r\nRojo redouble his efforts to betray Anda and to get possession of\r\nthe treasure which had come on the patache, \"Filipino\". The British\r\noffered remission of tribute to all natives then in insurrection who\r\nwould surrender. Anda was charged with responsibility for the danger\r\nwith which the city was threatened. He was said to have prevented\r\nthe fulfillment of the treaty between Rojo and the British. To this\r\nAnda replied that he had not been a party to the treaty. The state\r\nof perpetual worry in which Rojo was kept brought about his death\r\non January 30, 1764. Even before this he had practically lost his\r\nstatus as governor and the British were treating with Anda for the\r\nsurrender of the Islands. [672] This continued until the legitimacy\r\nof the position of Anda was recognized by Governor Torre. [673]\r\n\r\nA statement of the above facts aids in clarifying our view of\r\nAnda's position. It certainly can be said that there was neither an\r\naudiencia nor a governor with sovereign powers in Manila; this lack\r\nfurnished a reasonable basis for Anda's claims. However clearly it was\r\nestablished that a vacancy existed in the governorship, his position\r\nwould have been sufficiently tenable had it been based solely on the\r\ngrounds that the archbishop had delegated him as lieutenant of the\r\ncaptain-general, with military powers. The archbishop-governor had\r\ngranted him that title and those powers for the very purpose for which\r\nhe had utilized them, namely, for the defense of the Islands against\r\nthe British. In view of the support which was extended to Anda in his\r\ncontention that he was governor and captain-general as long as the\r\narchbishop and the regularly constituted audiencia were prisoners,\r\nit is not easy to understand why it was necessary for him to justify\r\nhimself by advancing the claim, first, that he was the audiencia,\r\nand, second, that he was the governor because he had the authority\r\nof the audiencia. The only accountable reason for this was probably\r\nthe necessity of nullifying the commands of the archbishop which\r\nwere being issued from the captured city. He may have felt that such\r\nmeasures were imperative in order to gain and retain the respect of\r\nthe natives and provincial officials who were not under his immediate\r\ninfluence and who were consequently more independent and inclined to\r\nbe insurrectionary and riotous. Yet, it is hardly possible that the\r\nlegal arguments advanced in support of his claims were understood by\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear, moreover, that Anda was entirely justified in his\r\nargument by the laws. No doubt he was right in regarding himself as\r\nthe audiencia, on the basis of the laws cited by him. However, the\r\nlaw did not at that time authorize the succession of the audiencia\r\nto a vacancy in the governorship. The cédulas of September 8, 1720,\r\nand of August 15, 1731, were still in force in the Philippines, and\r\nby virtue of these and by the special cédula promulgated in 1761 in\r\nfavor of Rojo, an ecclesiastic was authorized to act as governor\r\nin case of a vacancy. According to law and precedent, the post\r\nvacated by the archbishop-governor should have been filled by the\r\nbishop of Nueva Segovia, and by the bishop of Cebú, respectively. It\r\nis true that neither of these ecclesiastics put forth any effort\r\nto maintain their legal rights, probably for the reason that they\r\nrealized their incapacity to organize and conduct the defense of the\r\nIslands as well as Anda had done. The audiencia had not succeeded to\r\nthe government since 1715; it had been forbidden to do so in 1720 and\r\nsubsequently. It is therefore difficult to understand how Anda could\r\nhave seriously advanced the claim that in his capacity as sole oidor\r\nhe should succeed to the government.\r\n\r\nAside from the opposition of the archbishop, there does not seem to\r\nhave been any great difference of opinion on the question of whether\r\nAnda could rightfully claim the prerogatives of the audiencia and\r\ngovernorship at the same time. Rojo paid no attention to the legal\r\narguments advanced by Anda, but contended that both the governor and\r\nthe audiencia were still in full possession of their powers and in\r\ncomplete enjoyment of their liberties within the city. No comment\r\nis to be found on Anda's contention in the royal dispatches which\r\nwere sent in answer to his reports. It is important to note, however,\r\nthat after the death of the archbishop, and after the restoration of\r\npeace, the fiscal was of the opinion that the government should go\r\nto Fray Ustáriz, bishop of Nueva Segovia. [674] In this opinion he\r\nwas seconded by Oidor Galbán.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that Anda was supported in his resistance to Archbishop\r\nRojo and the British largely on grounds of expediency. This is\r\nclearly brought out in a letter which Fiscal Viana wrote to the king\r\non October 30, 1762, stating his opinion that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Since the Audiencia and governor are unable to exercise their\r\n    duties, Anda, as the only active and unembarrassed minister who is\r\n    able to retain his place under the authority of Your Majesty, has\r\n    declared himself governor, royal audiencia and captain-general. It\r\n    is evident that, being a prisoner, the archbishop cannot be\r\n    governor and captain-general, and it is equally certain that\r\n    the government and office of captain-general falls back on the\r\n    audiencia and the oldest oidor. [675]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis argument savors of expediency and sound practicability rather\r\nthan of interest in the legal quibble. Had Viana been convinced of\r\nthe legality of Anda's claims he would not subsequently have supported\r\nUstáriz. Viana contended that neither the archbishop nor the audiencia\r\nenjoyed sovereign powers when they were prisoners. Anda, on the other\r\nhand, was in such a position that he could utilize his legal powers;\r\nhe used them to good advantage and effectively, therefore he was\r\nentitled to recognition.\r\n\r\nAside from the question of legality, it is important to note that Anda\r\nwas the only person who was able to exercise sovereign powers during\r\nthis time. It is certain, moreover, that he prevented the Islands\r\nfrom falling into the hands of the British and that he maintained the\r\ncontinuity of the sovereignty of Spain in the Islands from 1762 to\r\n1764. During his rule in the provinces he exercised practically all\r\nthe functions of a normal government. Aside from the management of\r\nmilitary affairs he administered the finances and levied tribute. As\r\nnoted above, he contrived to obtain possession of the royal treasure\r\nwhich had been sent to Laguna; he was consequently better equipped\r\nfinancially than he would have been otherwise, and better than his\r\nrivals in the city. His finances were also augmented by the favorable\r\ncircumstance of his capture of the \"Filipino\" which was returning\r\nfrom Acapulco with the proceeds of the sale of her former cargo. [676]\r\n\r\nOther functions of a semi-military and governmental character were\r\nexercised by Anda in his capacity as acting governor. In some of these\r\nmatters he was assisted by the fiscal and audiencia in the latter part\r\nof his administration. He regulated the prices of provisions in order\r\nto prevent them from attaining prohibitive proportions. He did all that\r\nhe could to further and encourage interprovincial trade. He issued\r\norders in regulation of wages. In order to discourage drunkenness\r\nhe forbade the sale of nipa wine except in small quantities. He\r\ndiscouraged the importation of wine from Laguna. He took measures\r\nto prevent the Chinese from counterfeiting or chipping coins, and\r\nhe declared what should be legal tender. He forbade the shipment of\r\nprovisions to the beleaguered city and refused to permit the natives\r\nunder his jurisdiction to shelter or otherwise assist an Englishman. He\r\nprevented secular priests from communicating with the archbishop. In\r\norder to encourage service in the army he exempted natives from the\r\npolo, or labor tax, and he also made certain exceptions to the general\r\nrule for the payment of tribute to offset the decree of the British\r\nwho had offered wholesale exemption from the payment of tribute\r\nin order to attract the natives. Anda issued very severe orders to\r\nprevent looting and extortion on the part of his soldiers. Because of\r\nthe alliance between the Chinese and the British, Anda was obliged\r\nto take repressive measures against the former. He forbade games of\r\ndice, cock-fighting and card-playing so as to raise the morale of\r\nthe natives, to prevent thefts and to encourage law and order. He\r\nprescribed the death penalty for theft. Anda's rule was little less\r\nthan a dictatorship, with all the powers of government centered in\r\nhimself and in his immediate advisors. [677]\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that when Anda's resistance gave\r\ncertain assurances of success, the fiscal, Viana, and the oidores,\r\nGalbán and Villacorta, escaped to his capital, attached themselves to\r\nhis cause and assumed a share in his government. Anda was willing\r\nto recognize them as magistrates of the audiencia, and as such\r\nthey officiated. Villacorta made some trouble for Anda, however,\r\nby claiming the right to act as governor on the ground that he was\r\nAnda's senior in the audiencia. This was generally recognized, but\r\nAnda refused to accede to his demands, and the matter was dropped\r\nfor a time. [678] Anda found that his colleagues, Viana and Galbán,\r\nwere of the opinion that Bishop Ustáriz was legally entitled to the\r\noffice of governor, but there was some doubt in their minds whether\r\nhe should be invited at that time to act as governor. Anda consulted\r\nthe Bishop of Camarines and that prelate expressed his willingness\r\nto submit to the decision of the audiencia. The Augustinians and\r\nDominicans were of the same opinion, but the Jesuits and Franciscans\r\n\r\n\r\n    told him, that in the then (sic) situation of the islands he alone\r\n    could preserve the public tranquillity, and on that account he\r\n    ought to retain the supreme authority. This diversity of opinion\r\n    was not very gratifying to Señor Anda, and although the troops\r\n    were in his favour, he was by no means desirous of having recourse\r\n    to violence. [679]\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after the death of Archbishop Rojo, Anda received dispatches\r\ninforming him that peace had been restored between Spain and England;\r\n[680] at the same time the British received orders to evacuate the\r\ncity. Now that Anda's presence in the field as military commander was\r\nno longer absolutely required, a three-cornered fight arose among the\r\nsupporters of Villacorta, Ustáriz and Anda. Each of these contenders\r\nwas able to advance a reasonable claim. Villacorta was certainly\r\nthe senior magistrate, and thus he had a better right legally to the\r\noffice than Anda. Ustáriz was bishop of Nueva Segovia and as such, was\r\nentitled to the governorship according to the most recent law. \"Anda\r\nhad in his favor the circumstance of having defended the islands,\r\nand of having prevented the English from advancing to the northern\r\nprovinces; and, above all, he commanded the troops, who were attached\r\nto him, and this served to check the pretensions of the others.\" [681]\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the interim governor, Francisco Xavier de la Torre,\r\nput an end to these disputes. He had been dispatched to the Islands\r\nby the Viceroy of New Spain with the title of teniente del rey\r\n(king's lieutenant), and in accordance with his instructions he\r\nassumed the temporary government on March 17, 1764, which he retained\r\nuntil the arrival of Governor Raón in July, 1765. Anda's residencia\r\nwas taken by his successor, and it was found that the finances of\r\nthe colony had been faithfully and honestly administered during his\r\nadministration. He was able to account for all of the money taken\r\nfrom the \"Filipino\", turning over two million pesos of these funds\r\nto the new governor, accounting for the balance. Anda was recalled\r\nto Spain, where he was presented at court, receiving the personal\r\nthanks of the sovereign. [682]\r\n\r\nTorre's accession to the governorship marks the discontinuance in\r\nthe Philippines of the practice of allowing the archbishop to take\r\ncharge of the government during vacancies. On no subsequent occasion\r\nin the history of the Islands did an ecclesiastic take over the rule\r\nof the Islands. [683] It would seem that this plan of succession was\r\nabandoned quite generally throughout Spain's dominions, though there\r\nis no instance in which the rule of a prelate ever resulted quite\r\nso disastrously as in the Philippines from 1762 to 1764. Torre's\r\naccession marks the return to the practice introduced in 1608 and\r\nfollowed from time to time throughout the history of the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia, as a tribunal, concerned itself no further with\r\nthe temporary government of the Islands. On September 30, 1762, a\r\nnew cédula authorized the appointment of a teniente del rey by the\r\nviceroy of New Spain, and the succession of this official was ordered\r\nin case of a vacancy. This law was repromulgated on two subsequent\r\noccasions, the first time on November 23, 1774, and again on July 2,\r\n1779. [684] The plan of succession which it authorized was followed\r\nquite generally in the subsequent history of the Islands, until the\r\nseparation of New Spain in 1821 rendered impossible the appointment of\r\na teniente by the viceroy. Anda's government was the last occasion on\r\nwhich the audiencia, in reality or in theory, ever attempted to rule\r\nby its own right, except by association with the teniente del rey,\r\nwith whom it acted in the usual advisory capacity, as authorized in\r\nthe above-mentioned laws.\r\n\r\nBy the Royal Instruction of Regents of 1776, the regent was authorized\r\nto act as president of the audiencia during the absence of the\r\ngovernor, and in case there were no regent, the senior magistrate of\r\nthe audiencia was to take his place. [685] This law was confirmed\r\nby the cédula of August 2, 1789, which ordered that viceroys and\r\npresidents, on going outside of their capitals, \"should assign to\r\nthe regents the faculties for the dispatch of the most important\r\nand immediate affairs.\" [686] A subsequent law, dated July 30, 1779,\r\nstated that \"these important and immediate affairs\" did not include\r\n\"the duties and functions of the captain-general.\" Again, the royal\r\norder of October 23, 1806, [687] commanded that the audiencia should\r\nin no case take control of the government when there was a vacancy,\r\nbut that the name of the temporary governor should be contained in\r\nan envelope which was to be opened on the death of the governor, or\r\non his absence from the district. In case provision had not been made\r\nin this way, it was ordered that the government should be taken over\r\nby the ranking military officer of the colony, if he were higher than\r\nthe grade of colonel; if not, the regent or decano should be temporary\r\npresident, governor and captain-general, without ceding the exercise\r\nof any of the functions of this office to the audiencia. [688] This\r\nlaw was suspended by the royal order of July 12, 1812, and by the\r\ndecree of November 2, 1834, which ordered that the segundo cabo, or\r\nlieutenant-commander of the king's forces should succeed the governor\r\nand captain-general. [689] It is important to note that these laws\r\nwere applicable throughout the Spanish colonial empire. Subsequent\r\nvacancies in the Philippines were filled by military men, and the\r\naudiencia refrained from interference with the government.\r\n\r\nConsidering the question in its broadest phases, it cannot be said that\r\nthe audiencia administered the ad interim rule with a great degree of\r\nsuccess. This method of filling vacancies in the governorship failed\r\nfor a number of reasons. Owing to the divided composition of the\r\ntribunal, the rivalry and personal jealousy of the magistrates and\r\nthe perpetual quarrels and struggles which arose as a consequence,\r\nthe periods of its rule became wild scrambles for power in which\r\nthe strongest survived and reaped all the benefits of office. By\r\ntheir example, the oidores stimulated others to wrong-doing, and in\r\ntheir efforts to secure advantages for themselves they oppressed the\r\nresidents, Spanish and native, with the burden of their misrule. They\r\ndid not scruple to indulge in dishonest practices whenever occasion\r\noffered; indeed, they went out of their way to seek such opportunities.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the gravest defect of the rule of the audiencia lay in\r\nits failure as an executive, owing to the divided character of\r\nits composition. There was much jealousy, but neither unity nor\r\ncentralized responsibility. In their governmental capacity the oidores\r\nfrequently enacted measures and made recommendations of a statesmanlike\r\ncharacter, although they did not always succeed in enforcing them. The\r\nmagistrates were neither experienced legislators nor trained soldiers,\r\nand the latter defect seems to have been a cause of considerable\r\ndissatisfaction, especially among the military classes. These were\r\nnaturally jealous of an assumption of military power by lawyers, whose\r\ncommands they refused to obey. Nevertheless it must be conceded that\r\nsuch individual oidores as Morga, Alcaraz, Almansa and Anda acquitted\r\nthemselves of their military duties with great credit when called upon.\r\n\r\nThe reform which gave the government to the churchmen was designed to\r\nobviate the defects expressed above. It was believed that a prelate\r\nwould not be open to so many ventures of a questionable and mainly\r\ncommercial character. Moreover, the archbishops in Mexico and elsewhere\r\nhad fulfilled the duties of the executive on former occasions with\r\na fair degree of success. The church was the most powerful, highly\r\ncentralized and unified institution in the Philippines at the time\r\nwhen both the audiencia and the governorship were weakest. The\r\necclesiastical authority had repeatedly triumphed over the civil\r\ngovernment, and the former gave promise of being able to control\r\nmatters more effectively in the future than the audiencia had done in\r\nthe past. The rule of the churchmen did not remedy matters, however,\r\nexcept that it produced harmony through the exercise of force. During\r\nthe rule of the archbishops, with the exception of that of Rojo, the\r\naudiencia was so completely dominated by the ecclesiastical power that\r\nthe tribunal could scarcely be considered a factor in the government.\r\n\r\nThere were various defects in the rule of the ecclesiastics. Of these,\r\nperhaps the most prominent was their failure to meet the military\r\nrequirements of the position. Because of the natural incongruity\r\nexisting between ecclesiastical and military duties, they were\r\nobliged to delegate the command of the troops to military leaders,\r\nwho thus exercised an influence never realized by them during the\r\nrule of the audiencia. Archbishop Rojo was unwilling to trust the\r\nproblem of defense to any other person, though unable to cope with\r\nthe situation himself. Hence Anda forced his way to the front because\r\nhe was fitted to command and Rojo was not. As administrators and\r\nexecutives the prelates were as efficient as any others, but they were\r\nnever able to reconcile successfully the opposition of the civil,\r\npolitical, and commercial elements, who were displeased with the\r\nrule of an ecclesiastic. Surprising as it may seem, the government\r\nof a prelate was usually most unsatisfactory to the churchmen and\r\nreligious authorities. If the prelate-governor were a friar, his rule\r\nwas resented by the members of all the rival orders. If he were a\r\nsecular priest, he was opposed by the friars of all the orders.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Rojo was enough to condemn the practice of permitting\r\necclesiastics to assume the government, but aside from that, there was\r\na more significant and fundamental reason. The increasing political\r\nauthority of the church at that time, both in the colonies and in the\r\nmother country, its widespread and almost irresistible dominance over\r\ntemporal affairs, demanded a radical change of policy whereby this\r\ndangerous ecclesiastical power could be checked. The rule of Anda,\r\nthough technically based on that law which gave the succession to\r\nthe tribunal, was not a typical instance of the government of the\r\naudiencia, nor did that period present all the features of such\r\na rule. The influence of the audiencia as a body was practically\r\nnil. Anda governed because he was a strong man, not because he was\r\nsole oidor or because he was lieutenant-governor. His government was\r\nvirtually a dictatorship, based on military power, but, nevertheless,\r\njust and benevolent. His extra-judicial actions met with the king's\r\napproval, because they were efficient.\r\n\r\nHistory will show that the Audiencia of Manila assumed temporary\r\ncharge of the government because the distance and isolation of the\r\ncolony rendered such a course necessary and because it was thought\r\nthat the audiencia was best fitted to assume control. The government\r\nby the audiencia in the Philippines was not an isolated incident,\r\nbut was typical of the entire Spanish colonial empire. Owing to the\r\nconditions which we have noted, and judged by the standards which\r\nconstitute good government, the rule of the audiencia was neither\r\nsuccessful nor satisfactory. Its most far-reaching defect, as far as\r\nthe relations of the audiencia and the governor were concerned, lay\r\nin the wholesale exercise of administrative and military functions by\r\nthe magistrates of the audiencia. This impaired the quality of their\r\nservices as impartial magistrates and contributed in most cases to an\r\ninsatiable thirst for power. The magistrates were loath to surrender\r\nthe exercise of these governmental activities on the accession of\r\nthe succeeding governor, the audiencia displaying a marked tendency\r\nto continue in the exercise of administrative control. This, then,\r\nwas a decided cause of strife and dissension between the audiencia\r\nand the governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE AUDIENCIA AND THE CHURCH: THE ROYAL PATRONAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was frequently brought into contact with the\r\npowerful ecclesiastical organization in the Philippines. We have\r\nalready referred in this book to some of the notable occasions of\r\nthis relationship. Before the establishment of the audiencia the\r\nchurch exercised an extensive authority in governmental affairs. The\r\necclesiastics aided the civil government by administering justice in\r\nthe provinces when there were no civil courts. The prelates of the\r\nIslands, the provincials of the religious orders and even the friars\r\nadvised the governors and provincial officials on Indian affairs\r\nand the administration of the encomiendas. When the advice of the\r\nchurch was solicited by the home government as to the advisability of\r\nremoving the audiencia, the suggestions of Fray Alonso Sánchez and\r\nBishop Salazar went far toward bringing about a final solution of\r\nthe problem of government in the Philippines. [690] These were some\r\nof the ways in which the influence of the church was impressed upon\r\nthe audiencia.\r\n\r\nThe creation of an audiencia, with judicial and advisory functions,\r\nput an end to the exercise of these extraordinary powers by the\r\nchurch and tended to confine its activities to the ecclesiastical\r\nfield. Nevertheless, the prelates continued to advise the governors\r\nin administrative matters throughout the entire history of the\r\nIslands. Their influence was especially strong in matters relating\r\nto the natives, their government and protection, and the archbishops\r\neven went so far at times as to give advice on questions of foreign\r\npolicy. Most of the time this counsel was solicited and was well\r\nreceived. From 1650 onwards, as we noted in the last chapter, the\r\nchurch waxed exceedingly strong in the Philippines and the prelates not\r\nonly advised, but dominated governors and audiencias. In 1668, Governor\r\nDiego Salcedo was unseated, imprisoned and exiled by the commissary\r\nof the Inquisition, while a pliant magistrate of the audiencia took\r\nover the government and administered affairs in a manner entirely\r\nsatisfactory to his ecclesiastical supporters. The period from 1684 to\r\n1690 showed the weakness of the audiencia when opposed by a powerful\r\nprelate allied to a hostile governor. And in 1719 the church reached\r\nthe climax of its power by bringing about the murder of a governor,\r\nand then succeeding him, overcoming every opposing element in the\r\ncolony, including the audiencia. From that time onward the prelates\r\ngoverned during vacancies in the governorship--something which the\r\naudiencia had failed to do. Finally, in 1762, Simón de Anda y Salazar\r\nassumed the reigns of government and the obligations of defense,\r\nan act which was sanctioned technically because he was an oidor but\r\nreally because he was an able man, capable of accomplishing what the\r\nchurch had failed to do.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter it is not our purpose to review the historical facts of\r\nthe relations of the audiencia and the church or the growth of clerical\r\ninfluence over the audiencia. These matters have been referred to in\r\nearlier chapters. It is rather the design to study here the influence\r\nwhich the audiencia, in its turn, exercised in ecclesiastical affairs,\r\nnoting whence it derived its authority and what was the nature of\r\nits powers.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was established as the ultimate local authority,\r\nco-ordinate with the governor (or the viceroy in New Spain or Perú),\r\nfor enforcing the laws of the royal patronage. [691] Not only was\r\nit authorized to act as a tribunal in these matters, but also to\r\nofficiate as an active executive agent. It is clear that although\r\nthe governor was the royal vicepatron, he was not expected to act\r\nalone and unsupported in dealing with the powerful and often hostile\r\necclesiastical authority. In former chapters of this treatise\r\nattention has been given to the considerations which forced him\r\nto share the duties and responsibilities of government, finance,\r\ncommercial supervision, and even military affairs with the audiencia;\r\nthe support of that body was even more necessary in dealing with the\r\npowerful ecclesiastical organization.\r\n\r\nThe authority which the audiencia exercised jointly with the royal\r\nvicepatron was based upon the law ordering\r\n\r\n\r\n    our viceroys, presidents, oidores and governors of the Indies\r\n    to see, guard, and fulfill (the laws), and in the provinces,\r\n    towns, and churches (in the Indies) to see that all laws and\r\n    pre-eminences which pertain to our royal patronage are guarded\r\n    and fulfilled, ... which they will do by the best means that may\r\n    appear to them convenient, giving all the orders and instructions\r\n    necessary to the end that all (the instructions) that we may give\r\n    shall be carried out in due form; and we pray and charge [692]\r\n    our bishops and archbishops, deans, and ecclesiastical chapters of\r\n    the metropolitan and cathedral churches and cathedrals and all the\r\n    curates and occupants of benefices, clerics, sacristans and other\r\n    ecclesiastical persons, and the provincials, guardians, priors\r\n    and other religious of the orders, in so far as it is incumbent\r\n    upon them, to guard and fulfill them (the laws and preëminences\r\n    of the king) and see them fulfilled and obeyed, conforming with\r\n    our viceroys, presidents, audiencias and governors as much as\r\n    may be appropriate and necessary. [693]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this law the audiencia exercised the right of\r\nintervention in practically all matters to which the authority of\r\nthe vicepatron extended. Foremost among these were the supervision\r\nand administration of ecclesiastical revenues, the administration\r\nof vacant benefices, the extension of missionary influences and the\r\nconstruction of churches and monasteries. The audiencia, moreover,\r\nhad authority over the reception and installation of prelates,\r\nparish priests, and regulars, and their removal for cause. In all\r\nthese matters the audiencia was responsible directly to the king and\r\nmade reports thereon; in fact, it may be said that the tribunal,\r\nin co-ordination with the vicepatron, served as a connecting link\r\nbetween the church in the Islands and the royal council in Spain.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the relations between the audiencia and the church\r\nwill show that the tribunal exercised two kinds of ecclesiastical\r\npowers. These may be regarded respectively as executive and\r\njudicial. Although it was in their union that the audiencia exercised\r\nits most extensive and far-reaching power of ecclesiastical control,\r\nit is advisable for several reasons that these powers should be\r\nconsidered as distinct from one another. They will therefore be\r\ndiscussed separately in this treatise. In this chapter we shall\r\nconsider only the first of these powers--the one which was most\r\ndirectly concerned with the maintenance of the royal patronage--namely,\r\nthe authority which the audiencia exercised co-ordinately with the\r\ngovernor in the supervision and control of the church in the colony.\r\n\r\nAlthough there appears to have been no conflict of authority between\r\nthe governor and the audiencia over their mutual relations under the\r\nlaws of the royal patronage, it is advisable at the outset to settle\r\none difficulty which may present itself in this connection. Many of\r\nthese powers which the audiencia exercised were conferred upon the\r\nvicepatron exclusively. Indeed, a study of the laws alone would suggest\r\nthe possibility of a conflict of jurisdiction between the governor and\r\nthe audiencia in matters relating to the royal patronage. In actual\r\npractice, however, the governor shared the powers of ecclesiastical\r\nsupervision with the audiencia, and their relations were harmonious\r\nin all matters appertaining thereto. Indeed, there is record of fewer\r\nconflicts between the audiencia and the governor in this field of\r\nactivity than in any other.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the intervention of the audiencia in ecclesiastical\r\nmatters developed in the same manner and for the same reason as\r\nit came to have authority in matters of government, finance and\r\nmilitary administration. The manifest impossibility of the successful\r\nadministration of the many affairs of civil and ecclesiastical\r\ngovernment by the governor (or viceroy in New Spain and Perú)\r\nmade inevitable the division of power, which, though real, was not\r\nalways formally recognized by the laws. The audiencia was the only\r\nbody available with which the governor (or viceroy) might share these\r\nresponsibilities. Its judicial character, and the talent, training, and\r\nadministrative ability and experience (wider than that of the governor\r\nhimself) of its members made it the logical institution to which\r\nthe executive should naturally turn for advice and assistance. Not\r\nonly did he require counsel, but the moral and physical support of a\r\ntribunal of weight and authority was invaluable in dealing with the\r\nunited forces of a powerful ecclesiastical hierarchy. This is the\r\nbest possible explanation of that gradual assumption of authority by\r\nthe audiencia which seems to have been so indefinitely, yet freely\r\nconceded, and which apparently grew up neither in conflict with the\r\nlaw nor yet entirely in accord with it, but which, now recognized,\r\nand now ignored, was never denied or prohibited.\r\n\r\nThe cédula of October 6, 1578, in explanation of the various forms of\r\naddress in the expedition of royal cédulas, was designed to make clear\r\nthe respective jurisdictions of the vicepatron and the audiencia\r\nin ecclesiastical as well as in other governmental affairs. It\r\nordered that\r\n\r\n\r\n    when our royal cédulas refer in particular to the viceroys, they\r\n    alone shall attend to their fulfillment without other intervention;\r\n    if they designate the viceroy, or president or audiencia, they\r\n    shall all attend to their execution in accordance with the opinion\r\n    of the greater part of them that are in the audiencia, and the\r\n    viceroy or president shall not have more than one vote like the\r\n    rest that may be present, provided that this do not contravene\r\n    the superior government which we regularly commit to our viceroys\r\n    and presidents. [694]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile more than a joint authority with the vicepatron cannot be claimed\r\nfor the audiencia, and that authority not necessarily coequal, this\r\ncédula established beyond question the royal intention of recognizing\r\nthe audiencia as a support and an aid to the governor. This law\r\napplied to all the affairs of government, not pertaining any more\r\nextensively to the ecclesiastical than to the administrative sphere,\r\nbut this cédula, together with what actually happened, may be taken\r\nas evidence that the audiencia was meant to have jurisdiction in\r\necclesiastical affairs when royal cédulas granting or assuming the\r\nexercise of such jurisdiction were addressed to it.\r\n\r\nThe right of the officials of the civil government to interfere\r\nin questions of patronage was seldom seriously questioned by the\r\nchurchmen, although there were some notable instances in which\r\nreligious authorities objected to this exercise of power. Bishop\r\nSalazar, in his opposition to the plan of Fray Alonso Sánchez\r\nat the court of Madrid (1593-1595), expressed his disapproval\r\nof the interference of the governor and audiencia in questions of\r\npatronage. His opposition is further attested by several of his letters\r\nand declarations enunciated previous to that time. [695] He admitted\r\nthat the civil government, by virtue of the bulls of Alexander VI and\r\nJulius II, should act as the defender and champion of the church, but\r\nhe opposed any further participation in ecclesiastical affairs by the\r\ncivil power. Salazar's arguments are worth noting because they were\r\nadvanced during the formative period of the Islands' history. It was\r\nduring his prelacy that the basis of all future relations of church and\r\nstate was established. The arguments of Bishop Salazar were repeated\r\nwith little variation by Archbishop Poblete in his controversy with\r\nGovernor Salcedo in 1665 and later by Archbishop Pardo in 1686. [696]\r\n\r\nIn considering this question, the calm and impartial judgment of\r\na scholar is eminently preferable to the passionate arguments of\r\na prelate deeply concerned in the outcome of the dispute. Let us\r\nturn from the field of original research to a modern Spanish writer\r\non church history and law. Fray Matias Gómez Zamora, writing from\r\nthe vantage ground of the modern day, characterizes the acts of the\r\ngovernment officials of the earlier era as excessive and unjustified by\r\npapal bull or ecclesiastical canon. He even goes a step farther when he\r\ndeclares that \"many royal decrees and cédulas were wrongfully issued,\r\nwithout proper basis.\" He cites examples to prove his contention and\r\namong these he points to the foundation of churches and monasteries by\r\ncivil authorities without the confirmation of the prelate, alleging\r\nthat such practices were entirely illegal. [697] In like manner,\r\nhe criticises the cédulas of October 19, 1756, and of June 24, 1762,\r\nwhich bestowed upon the governor jurisdiction as vicepatron, [698]\r\nwith the right of settling whatever questions might arise. \"But,\"\r\nhe writes, \"it is clear that the viceroys, the audiencias and the\r\ngovernors did not have, nor could they have spiritual jurisdiction\r\nover the persons or property of the ecclesiastics, because in no\r\ncase can power which is delegated be greater than he to whom it is\r\ndelegated.\" [699] Thus does this distinguished writer attack the\r\nfoundation of the entire institution whereby Spain controlled the\r\nchurch in her colonies during a period of three hundred years.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the governor was the civil head\r\nof the church in the colony, it would be possible to fill this\r\nchapter completely with quotations of laws which were addressed\r\nto the audiencia in recognition of its right of intervention\r\nin ecclesiastical matters. The necessity of reserving space for\r\nspecific cases illustrative of history and practice permits only a\r\nscanty summary of the most important of these laws. In practically\r\nall these cases the audiencia participated conjointly with the\r\nvicepatron. The interposition of the audiencia was authorized in\r\nthe calling of provincial councils and synods, and the resolutions\r\nof these bodies had to be examined by the viceroys, presidents,\r\nand oidores to see that they were in accordance with the laws of\r\nthe royal patronage. [700] The audiencia was empowered to examine\r\nall papal bulls and briefs and to suspend those which had not been\r\nproperly authorized by the Council of the Indies. Disputes between\r\nprelates and arguments of churchmen based on bulls and briefs were\r\nto be referred by the audiencia to the Council of the Indies. The\r\naudiencia was authorized to enforce all properly authorized bulls\r\nand briefs and to exercise care that the ecclesiastical courts were\r\ngranted their proper jurisdiction in accordance with canon law. [701]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was authorized to enforce the law which forbade laymen\r\nto trade with priests. Punishment in the latter case was not meted\r\nout by that tribunal, but the offending churchmen were handed over\r\nto the prelates. [702] The audiencia, viceroy, and governors were\r\ncommanded to exercise supervision over the prelates and provincials,\r\nreceiving from the latter annual reports on the state, membership, and\r\nprogress of the religious orders and the work performed by them, which\r\ninformation in turn was forwarded to the Council of the Indies. [703]\r\nAll possible assistance was to be furnished by the audiencia and\r\ngovernor to missionaries remaining in the Philippines or going to\r\nJapan. [704] The governor and audiencia were ordered to supervise\r\nclosely the work of ecclesiastical visitors in the provinces,\r\nexercising special care that the natives were not imposed on or\r\nabused. The oidores were prohibited from interference with the internal\r\ngovernment of the religious orders. [705] Members of orders could not\r\nusually be removed by their provincials without the consent of the\r\nvicepatron and the audiencia, the authority of the latter extending to\r\nthe removal and exile of offending priests. [706] The audiencia was\r\nordered to make every possible effort to preserve harmony among the\r\nreligious and to adjust all differences arising between the orders,\r\nor within them. [707] The tribunal was authorized to keep prelates\r\nfrom exceeding their authority in passing judgment on erring priests,\r\nespecially to see that no punishments were imposed such as would\r\ninterfere with the prerogatives of the civil government. [708]\r\n\r\nThe following brief summary of laws of the early period, although\r\npossibly repeating data already given, shows the extent of the\r\nparticipation of the audiencia in the regulation of ecclesiastical\r\naffairs: [709]\r\n\r\n\r\n    All ecclesiastics holding office were first to gain the recognition\r\n    of the viceroy, president, audiencia or whatever authority might\r\n    be in charge of the province.\r\n\r\n    A list of the members of each order was to be furnished by their\r\n    provincial to the governing authority. Any changes subsequently\r\n    made in the membership of the orders had to be reported in the\r\n    same way.\r\n\r\n    The names of all religious teachers were to be submitted to the\r\n    audiencia, governor or other authority in control, for inspection\r\n    and approval.\r\n\r\n    The audiencia was instructed to inform itself relative to the\r\n    efficiency of the clergy and of religious teachers working\r\n    among the Indians, and to see that those lacking in educational\r\n    qualifications or in general capacity were not permitted to enter\r\n    the Islands. [710]\r\n\r\n    Notices of removals or of new appointments made among the\r\n    clergy were to be sent to the governor, audiencia, and to the\r\n    bishop. [711]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the audiencia under the royal patronage extended\r\nto practically all classes of churchmen and church affairs. [712] By\r\nthe cédulas of August 4, 1574, and of October 25, 1667, the audiencia\r\nacquired the right of passing on the credentials of prelates who came\r\nto the Islands. That tribunal was entrusted with the duty of seeing\r\nthat bishops and archbishops carried with them the duly attested\r\nconfirmation of the Council of the Indies, and no prelate was allowed\r\nto leave the Islands unless he had the permission of the governor or\r\naudiencia. [713] The tribunal exercised a check on the governor in this\r\nparticular and saw to it that in granting this permission he did not\r\nshow favoritism or otherwise violate the laws of the royal patronage.\r\n\r\nTwo striking illustrations of the audiencia's jurisdiction over the\r\ninspection of the credentials of the prelates and higher churchmen\r\noccur in the history of the Philippines. In 1674, Francisco de Palóu,\r\na French bishop who had been engaged in missionary work in China,\r\nwas cast upon the shores of the Philippines. The audiencia immediately\r\ndispatched orders for his detention, and he was not permitted to return\r\nto his district on the ground that his presence and jurisdiction in\r\nChina constituted an encroachment on the rights of Spain. China had\r\nbeen conceded to Spain by Alexander VI, and by virtue of the royal\r\npatronage, the right of making ecclesiastical appointments and the\r\nexercise of jurisdiction there were prerogatives belonging to the\r\nSpanish crown. [714]\r\n\r\nA similar case occurred in 1704, when Archbishop Tourón, a French\r\ndelegate destined for China, arrived in Manila. He was received by\r\nthe governor and audiencia, as he bore a legally executed commission\r\nfrom the pope for the visitation of all the churches in the Orient,\r\nand for the settlement of all ecclesiastical controversies which had\r\narisen there. The royal acuerdo considered that the dispatches and\r\ncredentials which he carried were in accordance with the law. Tourón\r\nwas accordingly permitted to set up an ecclesiastical court. He\r\nsuspended Archbishop Camacho from his office and freed from prison\r\nsome of the worst criminals in the Islands. He ordered the regulars\r\nto submit to diocesan visitation; but they refused to obey him since\r\nthey had already rejected the efforts of the archbishop to enforce\r\nthe principle. The Council of the Indies ultimately disapproved of\r\nthe admission of this foreign ecclesiastic without the authorization\r\nof the Spanish government [715] and as a consequence ordered the\r\nremoval of the governor and senior oidor, heavily fined the remaining\r\nmagistrates and reduced Archbishop Camacho to the position of Bishop\r\nof Guadalajara. [716]\r\n\r\nIn its joint capacity as assistant to the vicepatron and as a high\r\ncourt with jurisdiction over ecclesiastical cases, the audiencia\r\nsettled disputes between rival claimants to positions of authority\r\nin the church, particularly to the position of archbishop. The law\r\nwhich had been in force up to 1619 prescribed that the ecclesiastical\r\nchapter should fill the vacancy with a temporary incumbent, but some\r\neffort had already been made to have the senior bishop succeed to the\r\npost. Bishop Arce of Cebú was opposed to this plan on the ground that\r\neach prelate had more than he could do in the proper administration\r\nof his own bishopric. [717] Nevertheless it may be noted that on\r\nJanuary 22, 1630, Arce was made acting archbishop of the metropolitan\r\nsee of Manila by virtue of the acuerdo of the audiencia and the\r\nvicepatron. [718] Arce's accession to the post was in accordance with\r\na papal bull which had been promulgated with the king's approval at\r\nsome date between 1619 and 1630. There had been a three-cornered\r\nfight between the ecclesiastical chapter, the Bishop of Cebú, and\r\nthe Bishop of Nueva Segovia, and this conflict had been settled\r\nby the acuerdo in favor of Arce, while the chapter appealed to the\r\nCouncil of the Indies. When Guerrero, the new appointee, arrived, he\r\nimmediately laid claim to the office, which Arce refused to surrender\r\non account of an irregularity in the archbishop's appointment. Arce\r\nappealed to the audiencia, but the tribunal refused to authorize\r\nany innovations. [719] In a statement to the king, dated October 17,\r\n1655, he related that in 1629 the governor and audiencia had solicited\r\nthat he come to Manila and take the place vacated through the death\r\nof Archbishop Serrano. This would seem to indicate that the audiencia\r\nhad acted solely on the basis of its authority derived from the royal\r\npatronage, but in settling the dispute among the various ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities it also acted judicially. Guerrero's credentials finally\r\ncame, apparently executed in the proper form and they were referred\r\nto the audiencia by the governor. The tribunal, when it had satisfied\r\nitself that the commission was valid, placed thereon the stamp of\r\nits approval and accepted Guerrero as archbishop. Then the latter,\r\nin the words of Governor Corcuera, presented himself \"in the royal\r\ncourt of justice (the audiencia) before which he appeared to be\r\npresented [to his see], he swore upon the gospels not to interfere\r\nwith your Majesty's jurisdiction, to respect your royal patronage,\r\nand to be always your royal vassal.\" [720] In other words, he took\r\nhis oath of office as archbishop in the audiencia.\r\n\r\nThe above may be considered as a typical case of the temporary\r\ndesignation of a prelate for the archbishopric of Manila by the\r\naudiencia. To cite further instances of a similar nature would be\r\nunnecessary. The tribunal continued to inspect the credentials of\r\nbishops and archbishops before they were admitted to their posts\r\nthroughout the history of the Islands. This practice was followed\r\neven during the period from 1660 to 1762 when the church counted\r\nfor more as a political institution than either the audiencia or the\r\ngovernor. [721]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia exercised intervention in the removal of curates from\r\ntheir parishes. [722] As noted, already, these removals were made by\r\nthe vicepatron upon the recommendation of the prelate concerned. Of\r\ncourse, when the audiencia was governing ad interim it made these\r\nremovals itself. It also intervened when the vicepatron was present\r\non occasions when he requested the support of the tribunal or failed\r\nto act himself. The judicial authority of the audiencia, exercised\r\nthrough its entertainment of appeals from curates who had been removed,\r\nwill be considered in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nA great many reasons for removals were purely ecclesiastical, such\r\nas questions of the private lives and conduct of priests and friars\r\nand their insubordination and non-compliance with ecclesiastical\r\nor monastic rules. With these matters the audiencia did not concern\r\nitself unless deportation was involved, or the offenses of the priests\r\nconstituted crimes against the civil government. There is record of\r\nmany removals from curacies because of infractions of the marriage\r\nlaws by priests, such, for instance, as uniting heathen Chinese with\r\nChristian women, which was a violation of the pragmatic law of March\r\n23, 1776. Such cases, and indeed all which had to do with removals\r\nfrom curacies after 1795, were settled by ecclesiastical tribunals\r\nwith appeal to the papal delegate, without the intervention of the\r\naudiencia. [723]\r\n\r\nThe operation of the removal of regulars for cause was slightly\r\ndifferent. Unless the regular was the holder of a parish and subject\r\nto episcopal visitation, the prelate had no jurisdiction over him,\r\nand neither the governor nor the audiencia could interfere in the\r\nmatter, unless such intervention was requested by the provincial. [724]\r\nWhen the deportation of regulars not holding curacies was decreed,\r\nthe consent of the vicepatron or audiencia, acting for him, was\r\nnecessary. This was usually given on the recommendation of the\r\nprovincial, and the exile accordingly became an act of the civil\r\ngovernment. The formal consent of the Council of the Indies was\r\nnecessary for all deportations of this character, but the complete\r\nexercise of this prerogative gradually devolved upon the vicepatron,\r\nwho notified the Council of the act. [725]\r\n\r\nThe crimes of priests or ecclesiastics against the law and order of\r\nthe realm were punishable in the same manner and by the same agency\r\nas the simpler violations of ordinary subjects. Attention has already\r\nbeen given in another part of this treatise to a case in which the\r\naudiencia, in 1617, tried and punished six Augustinian friars who had\r\nbeen convicted of murder. [726] Their guilt was first ascertained by\r\na preliminary investigation within the order, after which they were\r\nhanded over to the audiencia.\r\n\r\nThe statement has been made above that the audiencia was not allowed to\r\ninterfere in the internal régime of the convents or monasteries. [727]\r\nHowever, when the provincials of the orders were unable to keep\r\nthe friars in subordination they frequently called upon the civil\r\ngovernment for support and assistance. This was done in 1715 when the\r\nCastilian Recollects rebelled against their provincial, incorporated\r\nthemselves into a separate chapter, and entrenched themselves in\r\nthe convent at Bagumbayan, outside the Manila wall. Oidor Torralba,\r\nthen acting as governor and vicepatron, came to the support of the\r\nprovincial upon appeal. He cannonaded the recalcitrants, arresting\r\nand imprisoning them on their surrender, and finally banished their\r\nleaders. [728] On this same occasion, it may be noted, the provincial\r\nsolicited the aid of the archbishop, whose interference the rebellious\r\nfriars had resisted as an attempt at episcopal visitation.\r\n\r\nThe disciplinary jurisdiction over priests and friars referred to\r\nabove suggests a similar authority which the audiencia exercised over\r\nthe prelates. Within the period of one year after the installation of\r\nArchbishop Guerrero at Manila in 1636, the governor, with the support\r\nof the audiencia, had banished this same prelate and his ecclesiastical\r\nprovisor, [729] condemning the former to pay a fine of 2000 ducats. The\r\ngovernor contrived also to influence the judge-conservator [730]\r\nto pronounce a ban of excommunication upon them both, in return\r\nfor a like censure that had already been passed on the governor by\r\nthe prelate. [731] The banishment of Archbishop Poblete by Governor\r\nSalcedo and the audiencia prior to the arrest of that governor by\r\nthe commissary of the Inquisition, the exile of Archbishop Pardo in\r\n1684, and the imprisonment of Archbishop de la Cuesta by Governor\r\nBustamante and the audiencia in 1719, are incidents in the history\r\nof the Islands which serve well as illustrations of the disciplinary\r\nand coercive jurisdiction of the vicepatron and audiencia over the\r\nchurchmen. These events need only be referred to here, as they have\r\nalready been discussed in relation to other phases of the history of\r\nthe audiencia.\r\n\r\nAs visitors of the provinces, the oidores were required to inspect\r\nthe ecclesiastical work of the parish priests and to note their care\r\nand treatment of the Indians. [732] In the exercise of these duties\r\nthey were protected by a law which forbade prelates to proceed against\r\nthem with censures while they were carrying on such investigations. Le\r\nGentil, the noted French traveller, who visited the Islands during\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, testified that the oidores\r\ndid not fulfill their duty with great faithfulness. Le Gentil stated\r\nthat on account of their dependence on the hospitality of the priests\r\nwhen travelling from place to place in the provinces, the visitors'\r\ninspections were merely perfunctory and of little value. [733]\r\n\r\nThe above testimony is not corroborated, however, by the report of\r\nOidor Francisco Guerela who was sent to Camarines in 1702 to take\r\naccount of tribute and to inquire into the state of the encomiendas. He\r\nreported that in the curacies which were administered by the\r\nFranciscans there was an entire absence of religious instruction,\r\nthe natives were mistreated, and they were permitted to continue in\r\nidolatry, drunkenness, and superstition. Neither the priests nor the\r\nalcaldes mayores exerted any uplifting or civilizing influence. The\r\nalcaldes mayores, it was alleged, connived with the priests to\r\ndefraud the natives by the imposition of excessive tribute and by the\r\nexaction of all sorts of fraudulent ecclesiastical tithes. The oidor\r\nin this case sought to remedy this state of affairs by dispatching\r\nreformatory edicts against the friars, and by posting notices and\r\ncopies of royal decrees and cédulas designed to inform the natives\r\nof their rights under the law and to warn them against the imposture\r\nof the friars. Whereupon the Franciscans appealed to the Bishop of\r\nCamarines and persuaded him to excommunicate the oidor on the grounds\r\nthat he had usurped the ecclesiastical jurisdiction. This appeal to\r\nthe papal delegate was in direct violation of the cédula mentioned\r\nabove, protecting such visitations against ecclesiastical censure. The\r\noidor appealed to the audiencia and that body solicited the prelate\r\nby ruego y encargo to remove his censures. The audiencia would go no\r\nfurther, however, as two of the magistrates were personally hostile\r\nto Guerela, hence the oidor was obliged to remain in the provinces at\r\nthe mercy of the friars. After six months of isolation, Guerela, who\r\nwas broken in health, sent an appeal for aid to the king on June 20,\r\n1702. This memorial embodied a full account of his attempts to make\r\nnecessary reforms in the provinces subject to his visitation. [734] It\r\nwas presented to the Council of the Indies on October 14, 1706. [735]\r\nThree observations might be made from this incident. First, there was\r\nlittle vigor, promptitude, or effectiveness in the Spanish judicial\r\nsystem as therein exemplified. It took four years for this petition to\r\nbe presented to the Council and considerably more time for an answer\r\nto be made. Secondly, this affair shows to what extent petty spite\r\nand private quarrels interfered with good government and efficient\r\nadministration. Thirdly, it illustrates the fact that the entire\r\ncivil government, including the audiencia, was very much under the\r\ndomination and influence of the ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\nAn inspection which was similar to that just described was made\r\nby Oidor José Torralba, in 1713, in the provinces of Albay and\r\nCebú. Torralba was unable to complete his work, owing to his recall\r\nto Manila, where he was obliged to resume his place in the audiencia\r\non account of the insufficient number of magistrates present in the\r\ntribunal. It seems that in the provinces subject to his visitation,\r\nthe former charges of the Franciscans had been turned over to the\r\nseculars, most of whom were natives. Torralba reported that under\r\nthe careless and incompetent administration of the parish priests,\r\nthe churches had gone to ruin and all Indian instruction had been\r\nabandoned. In his report he commented unfavorably on the stupidity and\r\nimmorality of the native clergy, alleging that in them lay one of the\r\ncauses of the poverty and degradation of the people. He recommended\r\nthe restoration of the regulars. [736] Torralba's recommendations\r\nwere not followed. Either because of his hurried departure from\r\nthe provinces where he left his work unfinished, or because of the\r\ndisinclination or lack of authority of the audiencia and vicepatron,\r\nno definite steps were taken at this time for the amelioration of\r\nthe condition of the people or for the reform of the clergy.\r\n\r\nThat the interests of the friars were vigorously and effectively\r\nchampioned at the court is evidenced by the royal decree of June\r\n14, 1714, which was dispatched not alone to the Philippines, but\r\nwhich was made general in Perú and New Spain. [737] It forbade the\r\ngovernors and audiencias using their authority as vicepatrons to\r\njustify their interference with the interior administration of the\r\nconvents and monasteries of the orders, which it was complained they\r\nwere doing without authorization. This decree particularly emphasized\r\nthe principle which has already been set forth in this treatise that\r\nthe vicepatrons and audiencias should not concern themselves with\r\nthe discipline and punishment of friars not holding curacies. The\r\npromulgation of this decree was brought about as a result of the\r\nefforts of the commissary of the Franciscan order in Madrid.\r\n\r\nNot only were the oidores required to inspect the work of the parish\r\npriests, but the audiencia, in the exercise of the royal patronage,\r\nwas authorized to receive, assist, and supervise the ecclesiastical\r\nvisitors who came from Spain or Mexico, or were designated from the\r\nranks of the local clergy to inspect the orders. [738] These visitors\r\nwere also authorized to inspect friars who were in charge of parishes,\r\n[739] and when on these tours of inspection they might be accompanied\r\nby the prelate in charge of the curacies retained by the friars\r\nunder inspection. The audiencia was to co-operate in all possible\r\nways with these visitors, and should any question arise between them\r\nand a prelate over jurisdiction, the tribunal was to do everything\r\npossible to bring about a harmonious adjustment of the points of\r\ndifference. This is illustrated by a case which arose in 1776, when\r\nFray Joseph Pereyra was given a royal commission to make a general\r\ninvestigation of the Augustinian order in the Philippines. Fiscal\r\nAndrade of the audiencia demanded that Pereyra should submit all\r\nhis documents for inspection on the basis of the royal patronage\r\nand other laws, [740] but the audiencia, under the presidency of\r\nGovernor Anda, refused to support the fiscal. The king, on April 6,\r\n1778, rebuked the audiencia for its failure to support the royal\r\npatronage, citing two cédulas, those of July 2 and of October 14,\r\n1773, respectively, in which he had already admonished the vicepatron\r\nin that particular. [741] The failure of the audiencia and governor\r\nto exercise all their prerogatives in support of the royal patronage\r\non these various occasions can probably be attributed to dissensions\r\nwithin the tribunal and to the corrupting influence of the church.\r\n\r\nThe statement has frequently been made in this treatise that the\r\naudiencia served as a connecting link between the court and the\r\ncolony. It constituted a channel through which a large amount\r\nof correspondence was carried on, and one of the duties most\r\nfrequently required was that of furnishing special and regular\r\nreports and informaciones [742] on various subjects connected with the\r\nchurch. [743] Notwithstanding the vast number of ecclesiastics present\r\nin the colony, who could and did make special and regular reports,\r\nand were indeed required to make them, the audiencia was frequently\r\ncalled upon to render reports on precisely the same subjects as those\r\ncovered by the churchmen. In this way points of view other than\r\nthe ecclesiastical were obtained. Thus the advice of magistrates,\r\nlawyers and men in active touch with the government served to temper\r\necclesiastical opinion in the same way that the advice of prelates\r\nexercised an influence on matters purely governmental. Taking into\r\nconsideration their position in the colony, the oidores were better\r\nqualified to obtain and impart information concerning the church than\r\nmost authorities.\r\n\r\nTo indicate the vast field of special subjects in which the oidores\r\nwere required to report, various instances may be mentioned. On July\r\n1, 1598, the king desired information concerning the alleged need of a\r\ngreater amount of space on the galleon for the support of the bishopric\r\nof Nueva Segovia. The archbishop and the bishop of that diocese had\r\nboth recommended that more cargo-space be given to the church. The\r\nking desired to know whether, in the opinion of the oidores, the\r\nprivilege of shipping two hundred tons would be sufficient for the\r\nneeds of the bishopric in question. [744] Again, on December 7, 1610,\r\nthe audiencia was called upon to forward to the Council of the Indies\r\nevidence bearing upon a dispute between the natives of Quiapo and the\r\nJesuits over lands claimed by the latter society. [745] On another\r\noccasion the king requested of the audiencia a report concerning the\r\nwork, deserts, and financial condition of the convent of Santa Clara,\r\nwhich had asked for royal aid. [746] Frequently the audiencia was\r\ncalled upon to take a census of the number of priests, secular and\r\nregular, in the Islands and to report on the size of each order, the\r\nnumber of friars holding secular curacies in each, and the number of\r\nmissionaries. [747] It came to be its regular duty to furnish these\r\nreports at stated intervals, and when, for some reason, it failed\r\nto render them, a royal reprimand was forthcoming. A yearly report\r\nwas also made on the number of friars entering the Islands, how many\r\nhad gone to China, the number of souls ministered to by each order,\r\nhow large was each province, and how many people there were in each\r\ncuracy. [748]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that the churchmen were also held responsible\r\nfor this information and that reports on these same subjects were\r\nrequired of the prelates and provincials. [749] It is evident that\r\nthe report of the audiencia was utilized as a check to prevent\r\nmisrepresentation on the part of the friars, especially since it was\r\nalways the object of each order to prove that it was over-worked and\r\nin urgent need of more members. As friars were sent to the Islands\r\nat the royal expense, [750] and as they were supported after their\r\narrival by the royal treasury, the exercise of economy was always\r\ndesirable. On the other hand, it was to the interest of an order to\r\nmake its requirements and accomplishments appear as great as possible.\r\n\r\nAnother function which the audiencia came to exercise by virtue of\r\nits authority in behalf of the royal patronage was that of general\r\nsupervision over the colleges and universities. In the laws of\r\nthe Indies this duty was imposed upon the viceroys and governors,\r\n[751] and nothing was said of the authority of the audiencia in\r\nthat particular. According to the laws of the Indies, in fact,\r\nthe audiencia had little jurisdiction or authority over colleges,\r\nuniversities and seminaries, but as the administration of these was\r\nentirely in the hands of the church, the audiencia came to exercise\r\nmuch the same authority over education that it did over other\r\nchurch activities. [752] Oidores and fiscales were forbidden to act\r\nas rectors, but they might participate in the law examinations to\r\nsatisfy themselves whether the standard of instruction in the royal\r\nuniversities and colleges was sufficiently high, and whether the\r\neducation, training and ability of candidates for the licentiate's\r\ndegree gave evidence of their fitness. [753] According to the royal\r\ndecree of November 27, 1623, the University of Santo Tomás was founded\r\nin the Philippines with the advice of the governor and acuerdo of\r\nthe audiencia. [754] Here again that tribunal may be seen in the act\r\nof assuming non-judicial functions which primarily belonged to the\r\ngovernor through the unwillingness or inability of that official to\r\nact alone.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia early exercised advisory powers in educational\r\naffairs. The Jesuits as early as 1585 had requested permission to\r\nfound and establish a college or seminary in Manila, and the king,\r\non January 11, 1587, requested of the audiencia a report on the\r\ngeneral conduct, progress and accomplishments of the Jesuit order,\r\nasking in particular what benefit would accrue from the establishment\r\nof a Jesuit college in Manila. The audiencia, in its report of June\r\n25, 1588, characterized their work as very effective, the learning\r\nand ability of their personnel remarkable, but in the opinion of the\r\noidores there was scarcely any need of a college in Manila at that\r\ntime, and there were no means of supporting one. [755]\r\n\r\nWhen Santo Tomás became a royal university in 1648, the Jesuits were\r\nobliged to sue in the audiencia for the right to continue the bestowal\r\nof academic degrees. Their request was denied by the tribunal, but\r\nthe decision was reversed by the Council of the Indies in 1653. [756]\r\nOn May 3, 1722, San José was made a royal college and was subjected\r\nto the visitation and patronage of the audiencia. In 1769, when the\r\nJesuits were suppressed, an attempt was made to continue San José as\r\na secular institution under the supervision of the audiencia. This\r\nbrought forth such determined opposition from the Dominicans and\r\nfrom the friends and supporters of Santo Tomás that on June 30,\r\n1778, a cédula was issued ordering the audiencia to close San José\r\nand hand over all students in attendance there to the archbishop, so\r\nthat they might be placed in secular colleges and seminaries. [757]\r\nThis was done, and the audiencia rendered to the Council of the\r\nIndies a report on the administration of the finances pertaining\r\nto the transaction. The revenues derived from all unsold properties\r\nbelonging to the Jesuits were included in the temporalities, and the\r\nincome from these were transmitted to the royal treasury. Subsequently\r\nthe archbishop attempted to assume jurisdiction over these Jesuit\r\nproperties and funds, and to this the audiencia objected. In 1784\r\nthe matter was finally settled by the decree of the king in answer\r\nto an appeal which had been carried by the prelate from the audiencia\r\nto the Council of the Indies. He sustained the audiencia and forbade\r\nthe prelate from interfering with these temporalities.\r\n\r\nThe Dominicans were more successful in the maintenance of an\r\neducational institution. [758] On the occasion of the extension of\r\nthe charter of the University of Santo Tomás on May 17, 1680, the\r\nking ordered \"my president and the auditors of my Audiencia of that\r\ncity, and request and charge the archbishop of the city, the bishops\r\nof the said islands, the ecclesiastical and secular cabildos, the\r\nsuperiors of the orders, and any other of my judges and justices,\"\r\n... to acknowledge the University of Santo Tomás as a beneficiary of\r\nthe royal patronage. Its title was formally extended on June 21, 1681,\r\nby act of the audiencia. [759] The tribunal not only exercised the\r\nright of patronage over the Dominican university, but also over the\r\nCollege of San Juan de Letrán, a seminary for boys which was founded\r\nin 1640 and maintained by the Dominicans as an adjunct to Santo Tomás.\r\n\r\nReports, recommendations, and informaciones exist in abundance to\r\nprove that the audiencia exercised considerable influence in the life\r\nand history of these institutions. The tribunal celebrated acuerdos to\r\nimprove the instruction in mathematics, physics, law and medicine. It\r\nprovided for the examination of students, passed on their credentials,\r\nmade regulations for the bestowal of degrees and decided upon the\r\nfitness of prospective teachers. [760] It supervised the records\r\nof these institutions, audited their finances and sent reports to\r\nthe king and Council concerning the work of the universities and\r\ncolleges. In its jurisdiction and authority over these educational\r\ninstitutions the audiencia served in behalf of the sovereign as his\r\nroyal tribunal. These were royal universities, endowed with special\r\nroyal charters and privileges and it was fitting that they should\r\nbe controlled by the royal audiencia in the king's name. In addition\r\nto this, as they were administered by the church, the audiencia and\r\nthe vicepatron exercised joint control over them, in the name of\r\nthe royal patronage in the same manner that they supervised other\r\necclesiastical activities.\r\n\r\nAs we have already noted, the audiencia exercised jurisdiction over\r\nmatters of church finance. The most notable examples of its control\r\nmay be seen in the administration of tithes, [761] the funds of\r\ntemporalities, obras pias, funds of the Crusade, and espolios of\r\nthe prelates.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was authorized to guard the royal interest in the matter\r\nof the collection and the administration of tithes, particularly with\r\na view to seeing that over-ambitious churchmen did not obtain more\r\nthan their share, and that in the collection of the tithes they did\r\nnot oppress the natives. The special care of the oidores was to see\r\nthat tithes be not paid directly to the prelates. [762] In fact,\r\nthese funds were to be administered by the civil government, and\r\nprelates were not to be allowed to interfere with their collection. No\r\nchanges were to be made in the authorized manner of collecting these\r\nfunds on the responsibility of colonial officials. Recommendations\r\nfor reform should be made to the Council of the Indies either by\r\nthe prelate or by the audiencia. [763] The audiencia was ordered to\r\nsee that the proper division and distribution of tithes were made,\r\nand that the two-ninths of the gross sum collected was duly set aside\r\nfor the crown, in accordance with the law. [764]\r\n\r\nFurther evidence that the audiencia was regarded as the instrument\r\nof the royal will in these matters is afforded by the circumstances\r\nleading up to the reforms of 1768 and 1786; and it should be noted\r\nparticularly that the king and Council relied on that tribunal\r\nfor advice and assistance in the drafting and execution of these\r\nmeasures. A number of tentative laws and proposals for changes in the\r\nsystem of collection and administration of the tithes was sent to the\r\naudiencia, from time to time, prior to 1768, and the magistrates were\r\nrequired to submit opinions as to the availability and applicability\r\nof the proposed measures. In 1768 a decree was issued fixing the\r\ntithe at ten reales per Indian. Previous to that year a number of\r\nreligious orders owning large tracts of agricultural land had refused\r\nto pay these taxes, and the audiencia, by virtue of the royal order\r\nof September 25, 1768, was ordered to enforce the law, which it did,\r\neven proceeding to the seizure of the chattels of the recalcitrant\r\nfriars. [765] On December 11, 1775, the audiencia passed an ordinance\r\ndiminishing the tithes to be paid by natives, mestizos, Chinese\r\nand Japanese by one-half real per person. [766] On July 12, 1778,\r\nthe king asked the audiencia to submit evidence on the question of\r\nwhether the law worked any hardship on the inhabitants of the colony,\r\nand whether encomenderos and friars were paying their share. [767]\r\nAt the same time, and on the same date, the royal approval was given\r\nto the auto which the audiencia had enacted on December 11, 1775. The\r\nrecommendations of the audiencia were also largely followed in the\r\ndecree of January 20, 1786, which was merely a repromulgation of an\r\nearlier auto of the audiencia, which ordered that tithes should not\r\nbe collected directly from the Indians unless the latter were owners\r\nof lands. Otherwise they were to be collected from the landlords. [768]\r\n\r\nBy subsequent laws the audiencia was temporarily deprived of\r\nits jurisdiction over tithes. When the Philippine government was\r\nreorganized in 1787 by the Ordinance of Intendants, many of the special\r\ncommissions which had been previously retained by the magistrates were\r\nceded to the superintendent of real hacienda. The actual collection\r\nof tithes was made the duty of the superintendent by cédula of October\r\n6, 1792, [769] but because of its relation to the royal patronage the\r\naudiencia, in practice, found it convenient to retain control. Governor\r\nAguilar, who was also superintendent of real hacienda, wrote to the\r\nking on July 31, 1799, [770] alleging that there was no reason why\r\nthe audiencia should exercise this authority, when, by virtue of its\r\nfinancial nature, this duty belonged to the superintendent. He stated\r\nthat the audiencia had been given this jurisdiction when there had been\r\nno other authority for the collection of tithes, but that as it was\r\nnot a controversial matter, there was no reason for the continuance\r\nof this condition. In the letter referred to Aguilar stated that he\r\nhad attempted to put his interpretation of the law into execution,\r\nbut in so doing had been opposed by the audiencia. The answer to this\r\nappeal does not appear in connection with the original, but the royal\r\ncédula of April 21, 1803, restored to the audiencia jurisdiction over\r\nthe collection of tithes. [771]\r\n\r\nIt may be said, however, that with the creation of the superintendency\r\nthe audiencia was shorn of many of the miscellaneous functions with\r\nwhich it had been formerly endowed. The funds of the temporalities,\r\nhowever, did not come under this category. They were greatly augmented\r\nin 1767 when the Jesuits were suppressed, and as was usual with such\r\nmiscellaneous and unclassified duties, as well as on account of the\r\naudiencia's relation to the royal patronage, the administration of\r\nthese funds came under the charge of an oidor whose official title was\r\n\"administrator of the funds of the temporalities.\" [772]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the audiencia's share of direct control over these\r\nfunds was still considerable. On January 23, 1803, a cédula was issued\r\nordering that the money of the temporalities and obras pias should be\r\nput at the disposal of the acuerdo of the audiencia. [773] A report\r\nwas submitted to that tribunal by Superintendent Aguilar on July 20,\r\n1804, in accordance with this cédula. The report of Aguilar showed\r\na balance on hand of 151,625 pesos waiting to be sent to Spain\r\nby the first transportation. In 1809, the jurisdiction of these\r\nfunds was completely restored to the audiencia, with the provision\r\nthat the oidores who acted as their administrators should receive a\r\nthree per cent commission. As the funds were constantly drawn upon,\r\nand there were no further confiscations of property of this sort,\r\nthey can be accounted as of little importance, yielding practically\r\nno revenue from that date. Owing to the continual appeals of the\r\ngovernment for money with which to defray the expenses of putting\r\ndown the various insurrections from 1808 to 1814 and subsequently,\r\nthe funds of the temporalities, like every other peso that came into\r\nthe treasuries of the colonies, were sent to Spain as rapidly as they\r\nwere collected. [774]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia also audited the accounts of the obras pías, though\r\nits jurisdiction over these funds was often opposed. [775] The chief\r\nfoundations of the obras pías in Manila were the Santa Misericordia\r\nand San Juan de Diós. The wealth and power of the Misericordia became\r\nso great, [776] and so well did it profit by the various immunities\r\nextended to it, that by the early part of the eighteenth century\r\nit had become the object of the distrust and envy of all classes of\r\nManila society. It was chiefly disliked because it had been permitted\r\nto utilize so much free space on the galleon. Other inconveniences\r\nhad arisen from its participation in trade, wherein, possessed of so\r\nmany advantages, it was enabled to derive profits and benefits that\r\nwere denied to competing merchants in the colony. Complaints were made\r\nagainst it by certain religious orders, merchants, treasury officials,\r\noidores, and the governor, himself. It was the consensus of opinion\r\namong these that the accounts of this society should be inspected\r\nby the government, and, in accordance with these recommendations,\r\na cédula was expedited, ordering the society to submit its accounts\r\nto the audiencia for inspection and approval. [777]\r\n\r\nThe suspicions of the general public were confirmed, and the popular\r\ndistrust increased when the inspection of Oidor Calderón revealed\r\nthat the finances of the society had been carelessly kept, and that\r\nthe books contained numerous discrepancies. The scrutiny of the\r\noidor showed the existence of a deficit of 383,437 pesos; that is,\r\nthe records called for property in the hands of the society to the\r\nvalue of that sum which could not be found. The Misericordia, in a\r\nseries of protests, accounted for the discrepancies by alleging that\r\nthe audiencia had declared many of its debtors bankrupt. Relief from\r\nthe inspection was requested on the grounds that the local feeling\r\nand the prejudice of the oidores would cause them to be unfair to the\r\nsociety. It pleaded that the inspection should be made by the chief\r\naccountant of the Council of the Indies (contador de cuentas) once\r\nin five years. In this request it was supported by the recommendation\r\nof this official. [778]\r\n\r\nOn April 19, 1755, the cédula of November 9, 1747, was modified on\r\nthe basis of these protests, and in lieu of the annual inspection of\r\nthe oidor was substituted the requirement that once in three years the\r\nMisericordia should submit its own accounts. [779] This brought forth\r\na storm of protest from the residents of Manila, headed by Governor\r\nArandía, who went to some length to describe the abuses which had\r\narisen in the past from the unrestricted liberty which the Misericordia\r\nhad enjoyed. He accused the society of dishonest political practices,\r\ninterference with the government, bribery and corruption. He said that\r\nbehind its commercial operations there existed a veiled scheme by which\r\nthe church was seeking to monopolize the trade of the Islands. [780]\r\nThe opposition of the governor and residents bore fruit to the extent\r\nthat a compromise was made in the royal cédula of February 21, 1759,\r\nwhich restored the practice of having oidores inspect the accounts of\r\nthe Misericordia, though the examination was to be held only once in\r\nfive years. This, of course, was sufficiently lenient to defeat the\r\nentire scheme. Oidores were forbidden to interfere with the property\r\nof the society at any other time and in any other manner. [781]\r\n\r\nThe Misericordia maintained a stubborn and vigorous resistance to\r\nthe principle of visitation by the audiencia, but as far as may be\r\njudged by the data at hand, the law was not changed again, and the\r\naudiencia continued to exercise supervision. That the audiencia was\r\nprone to overstep its authority in the matter of these inspections\r\nis shown by an incident which occurred in 1776-1777. In the regular\r\nquinquennial inspection of the records of the Misericordia a number\r\nof abuses were uncovered. The funds were found to have been carelessly\r\nadministered, and the books inaccurately kept, owing to the negligence,\r\nincapacity, and corruption of the members to whom the funds had been\r\nentrusted. Governor Sarrio, as vicepatron, appointed Oidor Calderón\r\nas receiver and administrator of the funds, with the charge that the\r\noidor should suspend all payments until the accounts were straightened\r\nout. The Misericordia protested and on April 25, 1778, the king ordered\r\nthe governor and audiencia to desist from further interference with\r\nthe funds of the society, the royal disapproval being based on the\r\ncédula of February 21, 1759, which, while authorizing the inspection\r\nof the books of the society, forbade any minister \"to interfere with\r\nor interrupt said House in the administration or distribution of its\r\nfunds.\" [782]\r\n\r\nThe cédula of February 21, 1759, was reaffirmed on repeated occasions\r\nwhen the Misericordia refused to submit its books to the audiencia. The\r\nlast law touching upon this particular question was promulgated on\r\nAugust 2, 1787, when it was decreed that the accounts, books, records,\r\nand work of the Misericordia and its officials should be subject to\r\nthe inspection of the audiencia. [783]\r\n\r\nNot only was the opposition of the Misericordia a source of dispute\r\nbetween that society and the audiencia, but the matter of financial\r\ninspection caused disputes between the audiencia and other officials\r\nand departments of the government. The reforms of 1787 made trouble\r\nbetween the superintendent and the audiencia. Since this was a\r\nfinancial matter, the former claimed the right of auditing these\r\naccounts, which the audiencia refused to concede for the reason that\r\nit had always had supervision over these funds (when the right was\r\nexercised by any secular authority). The question was definitely\r\nsettled by the cédula of January 22, 1803, which ordered that \"the\r\nmoney of temporalities, pious funds, and charitable societies should be\r\nput at the disposal of the acuerdo, and that if any matters relative to\r\nthose branches were then pending before the superintendent, they should\r\nbe remitted at once to the audiencia.\" [784] This was accordingly\r\ndone by Governor (and Superintendent) Aguilar, [785] and after that\r\ntime the jurisdiction of the audiencia was no longer questioned.\r\n\r\nShortly after the establishment of the consulado of Manila in 1769,\r\na bitter dispute arose between that body and the audiencia for\r\njurisdiction over cases involving the commerce of the Misericordia. On\r\nthe basis of the cédula of July 8, 1774, the consulado claimed\r\nexclusive jurisdiction over all disputes involving trade which arose\r\nbetween merchants. It advanced the contention that in all suits\r\ninvolving losses of galleons the society should be considered in the\r\ncase of an individual merchant. The audiencia, basing its claims on the\r\nroyal patronage, declared the consulado to have exceeded its powers,\r\nin assuming the jurisdiction described above, and fined several of\r\nits members. The consulado appealed the case, and in reply the king\r\npromulgated a cédula on June 7, 1775, declaring that neither to the\r\naudiencia nor to the consulado belonged the jurisdiction over such\r\ncases, but that they should be tried in first instance by the Council\r\nof the Indies. [786] The reasons assigned for this decision were that\r\nthe consulado could not try such cases because merchants constituted\r\nits membership and because the fiscal and two oidores also belonged to\r\nits tribunal. Neither the audiencia nor the consulado, accordingly,\r\ncould impartially try commercial suits between merchants and the\r\nMisericordia; accordingly thereafter all evidence should be submitted\r\nto the Council for special action.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia and the governor had supervision over espolios and vacant\r\nbenefices. [787] When a prelate entered into office it was his duty to\r\nfile with the fiscal an inventory of all properties belonging to him\r\nat the time of his advent to the diocese. [788] On the occasion of his\r\ndeath a treasury official was designated to estimate and administer\r\nthe property left, pay the debts of the deceased churchman, execute\r\nhis will with regard to his property in accordance with the law,\r\nand turn over the residue to the royal treasury. This process was\r\nknown as taking the espolio.\r\n\r\nThe espolio of a deceased prelate was taken, according to the early\r\nlaws, by an official of the royal treasury, who was designated by the\r\npresident for the purpose, and who officiated under the supervision of\r\nthe audiencia. The tribunal verified the autos and substantiated the\r\nproceedings of the agent. [789] Whether any modifications in the manner\r\nof collecting, distributing or accounting for the funds or properties\r\nderived from these espolios were made elsewhere is not clear, but\r\nin the Philippines the abuses which arose in the settling of these\r\necclesiastical estates and benefices made the personal intervention\r\nof the oidores necessary on a number of occasions. By royal cédula\r\nof June 23, 1712, it was ordered that in all the audiencias of the\r\nIndies the magistrate next in rank to the senior oidor should be\r\nconstituted as the\r\n\r\n\r\n    private judge, who, with the concurrence of the oficiales reales,\r\n    should have jurisdiction over and should proceed against, receive\r\n    and collect all the products and rents of the vacant archbishoprics\r\n    and bishoprics until the day on which the new prelates should\r\n    take possession of their offices, proceeding with full cognizance\r\n    ... to the collection ... of whatever might be due, ... with the\r\n    assistance of the oficiales reales who in this matter are subject\r\n    to the royal audiencia. [790]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this same law the audiencias, viceroys, presidents and tribunals\r\nwere forbidden to interfere with this judge in the execution of\r\nhis duties, or to impede the execution or the law in any manner\r\nwhatsoever. The estates of prelates were thus placed on a basis similar\r\nto that occupied by the properties of civilians, which, we have noted,\r\nwere administered by a special magistrate of the audiencia. This cédula\r\nalso provided that all money left as a residue, after the debts of\r\nthe prelates were paid, should be sent to the king for distribution.\r\n\r\nIn view of the above-mentioned law, the practice followed in 1715,\r\non the death of Bishop Gorospe of Nueva Segovia, seems to have been a\r\ndirect violation of the royal command, and somewhat different from the\r\nusual method of settling the estates of prelates. As soon as Gorospe\r\ndied at Magaldán, Pangasinán, the alcalde mayor of the province sent\r\nimmediate notification to the governor and audiencia. The tribunal,\r\nin acuerdo, on the motion of the fiscal, authorized the alcalde mayor\r\nand the treasury officials to take the espolio of that prelate, which\r\norder was duly complied with. [791] The audiencia also dispatched a\r\nformal notification to Archbishop de la Cuesta and the metropolitan\r\nchapter, designating the former as the ecclesiastical governor of\r\nthe bishopric. [792]\r\n\r\nThe significant feature of this espolio is that it was taken by an\r\nofficial as inferior in rank as an alcalde mayor through the express\r\nauthorization of the audiencia, instead of being conducted by the\r\nsecond magistrate of the audiencia as the law directed. It is possible\r\nthat the arrival of the cédula of June 24, 1712, had been delayed, or\r\nthat this may have been a case, so frequent in the Spanish colonies,\r\nof compliance without obedience. Certain it is that the conditions\r\nof life and travel in the provinces were of such a character that an\r\noidor would have found it more comfortable to remain in the capital\r\nand delegate the disagreeable duties of the espolio in a far-distant\r\nprovince to the resident alcalde mayor. Attention has already been\r\ncalled to various complaints made by governors and others against the\r\ndisinclination of the magistrates to submit to the inconveniences of\r\nprovincial inspections. Again, it is very probable that the time and\r\nattention of the magistrate whose duty it should have been to take\r\nthis espolio were occupied with more important judicial duties. [793]\r\n\r\nThe citation or further multiplication of data relative to espolios\r\nwould be monotonous and unprofitable. Sufficient has been said\r\nalready to show the extensive participation of the audiencia in\r\nthe administration and settlement of the estates of prelates and the\r\nassignment and care of vacant benefices. It may be noted, however, that\r\nthe audiencia suffered little if any diminution of its authority over\r\nthe espolio through the Ordinance of Intendants. That code deprived\r\nthe oficiales reales and oidores of the duty, formerly incumbent on\r\nthem, of taking espolios and conferred it upon the intendants and\r\ncorregidor-intendants of provinces. However, it was still required\r\nthat the papers relative to the proceedings should be submitted\r\nafterward to the audiencia for legalization and approval. [794]\r\nAppeals and cases of litigation arising from them were to be settled\r\nin the audiencia. This decree made little difference in the procedure\r\nin the Philippines, as the corregidor-intendants were never instituted\r\nthere, and the oidores continued in the settlement of these matters,\r\nsubject to the designation of the superintendent, who, it will be\r\nremembered, was also governor and president of the audiencia. The\r\ntribunal passed, as always, on all acts of espolio and heard cases\r\naffecting them on appeal. In this manner the properties of the prelates\r\nwere administered in a conservative and legal manner and the interests\r\nof the crown were safeguarded.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia exercised joint authority with the vicepatron over\r\nquestions relating to the construction of churches and the conservation\r\nof ecclesiastical property. No monastery, convent, college, hospital,\r\nor other religious institution could be founded without the consent\r\nof the king, and this permission was obtained through the viceroy,\r\ngovernor, or audiencia upon the recommendation of the prelate of\r\nthe diocese. [795] The laws of the Indies conceded that matters\r\nwhich did not admit of delay could be settled by the president and\r\naudiencia. [796] In fact, as early as August 15, 1620, Governor Fajardo\r\nacknowledged receipt of a letter from the king in which occurred the\r\nstatement that \"no church or convent, not even a chapel, ought to be,\r\nor can be, founded unless concurrent with your permission, and that of\r\nthe Audiencia.\" [797] It was provided that all petitions of religious\r\norders for permission to construct convents and monasteries should be\r\nreferred to the council, with the recommendations of the audiencia,\r\nbut in actual practice, when the advice of the audiencia was in the\r\naffirmative, the vicepatron gave the desired consent, reporting on his\r\naction to the Council of the Indies. Thus we see that the governor and\r\naudiencia in reality exercised complete authority in uncontested cases.\r\n\r\nA large number of communications written to the audiencia by the royal\r\nauthorities exist, illustrating the nature and extent of the influence\r\nof the audiencia in these matters. In 1604, the king learned that the\r\nAugustinians of Cavite had founded a convent with no other authority\r\nthan that of the governor. This was contrary to the laws of the\r\nroyal patronage and the audiencia was ordered to correct the abuse,\r\nand to see that the royal orders were obeyed in the future. [798] On\r\nanother occasion the audiencia was ordered to correct certain abuses\r\nof the Jesuits, who had dispossessed the natives of their lands and\r\nhad built various structures thereon. The lands were ordered to be\r\nreturned to their rightful owners and the buildings destroyed. [799]\r\n\r\nThe ambitions of the friars to construct monasteries, convents and\r\nhospitals, and otherwise to manifest their powers and add to their\r\nincreasing strength had to be checked frequently. The audiencia was\r\ncalled upon to do this throughout the history of the Islands. Possibly\r\nthe best illustration of the authority of the audiencia in these\r\nmatters may be noted in the part which it played in restraining the\r\nAugustinians from the further extension of their influence during\r\nthe period from 1763 to 1778. The entire matter was summarized in the\r\nconsulta of the Council of the Indies dated December 10, 1777, and the\r\ncédula of April 6, 1778, with unfavorable results for the Augustinians.\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 1770, the provincial of this order applied for\r\npermission to construct a convent in Cavite and solicited an\r\nappropriation of four thousand pesos for this purpose. It was\r\nsuggested that the money should be supplied either by the income\r\nfrom vacant benefices or from the profits of the sale of betel to\r\nthe natives. The provincial laid special claim to royal aid on the\r\nextraordinary justification that the convent of his order at Imús,\r\nCavite, had been bombarded and destroyed by the British in 1763. On\r\nAugust 16, 1772, the Council of the Indies referred the matter to the\r\nAudiencia of Manila and the tribunal, after an exhaustive investigation\r\nof the subject, recommended non-compliance with the provincial's\r\nrequest. In its report, the audiencia reviewed the former attempts\r\nof this order to extend its power and influence. On December 2, 1765,\r\nit had tried to obtain permission to construct a convent at Nagtaján,\r\nwhich the audiencia and Fiscal Viana frustrated. The Augustinians\r\ntried again on February 20, 1766, asking for permission to build at\r\nBagumbayan. This plan the audiencia was also able to defeat. On August\r\n16, 1772, this same order, impatient at the delay of the Council in\r\nanswering its petition of November 17, 1770, and still persistent,\r\nsolicited permission from the governor alone, not alluding to the\r\nfact that a petition of this sort was at that time pending before\r\nthe Council of the Indies. This request was considered in the acuerdo\r\nwith unfavorable consequences for the Augustinians.\r\n\r\nThe report of the audiencia was forwarded to the court and was\r\nthere reviewed by Francisco Leandro de Viana, formerly fiscal of the\r\nAudiencia of Manila and at that time a member of the Council. Viana\r\nrecommended that not only should the desired permission be refused\r\nbut a rigid investigation of the legitimacy of titles to properties\r\nheld by the Augustinians should be made. He regarded as especially\r\nreprehensible the deliberate effort on the part of the provincial to\r\nobtain this permission from the governor in view of the unfavorable\r\nattitude of the Council of the Indies and of the laws ordering that\r\nlicenses for the construction of convents should be given only by\r\nthe Council of the Indies, after consultation with the prelate of\r\nthe ecclesiastical district and with the audiencia, governor, or\r\nviceroy. [800] In this way, due very largely to the influence of\r\nthe audiencia, the efforts of this order to extend its authority\r\nwere checkmated. This may be considered as a typical case of the\r\nintervention of the audiencia in behalf of the royal patronage.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted in another connection that the audiencia was called\r\nupon, from 1680 to 1720, partly as a tribunal of justice and partly as\r\nan agent of the royal patron, to investigate the titles of the lands of\r\nthe friars, and, by this proceeding, the tribunal deprived the orders\r\nof much of the property which they had usurped. [801] It may also be\r\nnoted that an oidor regularly inspected the royal hospital at Manila,\r\n[802] and when prelates and curates were transferred from one district\r\nor parish to another, property left by them was inventoried and\r\ntaken under the direction of the audiencia. [803] These measures were\r\ndesigned to insure the security and conservation of royal property.\r\n\r\nIn summary, it may be said that the audiencia possessed joint authority\r\nwith, but not equal to the vicepatron in the regulation and supervision\r\nof religious affairs. As a tribunal, and as an agent of the civil\r\ngovernment, the audiencia supported and assisted the vicepatron. At\r\ntimes, indeed, it acted in his stead. We have seen that the audiencia\r\nlabored in the interests of the royal authority when it passed on the\r\nacts of provincial synods and councils, and it inspected bulls and\r\nbriefs before they were allowed to become operative in the colony. It\r\nsought always to bring about a peaceful settlement of disputes between\r\nprelates, curates, and religious orders. Acting in the interests of the\r\ncivil government, the oidores made inspections in the provinces, noting\r\nthe work of the friars and parish priests in their particular fields,\r\ngiving special attention to the treatment afforded to the Indians by\r\ntheir ecclesiastical protectors. The tribunal acted as the patron of\r\nthe royal colleges and universities. It regulated the administration\r\nof ecclesiastical finances, devoting especial attention to tithes,\r\nobras pías and espolios. And finally, as we have just noted, it was\r\nendowed with considerable authority in determining the advisability of\r\nauthorizing the construction of churches, monasteries, and convents,\r\nor of permitting the orders to extend their influence in various parts\r\nof the colony. The intervention of the audiencia in these matters\r\nwas recognized by the court at Madrid and by the ecclesiastics of\r\nthe Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE AUDIENCIA AND THE CHURCH: THE ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same manner that the audiencia performed the functions of a\r\ncivil court, so did it exercise jurisdiction as a superior tribunal or\r\ncourt of appeal over prelates, church tribunals, and ecclesiastical\r\njudges. It will be our purpose in this chapter to determine the\r\nrelations of the audiencia with the various ecclesiastical tribunals\r\nand to direct attention to the occasions on which it acted as a court,\r\neither with original or appellate jurisdiction in ecclesiastical cases.\r\n\r\nIn this particular phase of the investigation an effort will be\r\nmade to distinguish between the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the\r\naudiencia and its acts relative to the royal patronage. Not only may\r\nthis distinction be made for conveniences of discussion, but it will\r\nbe readily seen that the character of the powers and jurisdiction\r\nexercised was widely different. When acting as a tribunal of appeal\r\nover prelates, provincials, and ecclesiastical courts the chief\r\nconcern of the audiencia was the administration of justice. When\r\nacting in defense of the royal patronage, as noted in the preceding\r\nchapter, its authority was primarily executive and administrative,\r\ndesigned always to safeguard the interests of the civil government.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, true that all the power exercised by the civil\r\ngovernment over the church proceeded from authority invested in the\r\nformer by the laws of the royal patronage. [804] Nevertheless, it must\r\nbe observed that there were times when the audiencia exercised the\r\nfunction of an impartial, disinterested court, with no aim or object\r\nother than that of maintaining simple justice. It may be conceded,\r\nfor example, that the authority which the audiencia exercised in\r\nthe settlement of disputes between religious orders and between the\r\nprelates and the regulars partook of the same judicial character\r\nas the jurisdiction which it had in settling disputes between civil\r\ncorporations and individuals. The intervention of the audiencia for\r\nthe protection of the Indians from the abuses of the churchmen,\r\n[805] its entertainment of the recurso de fuerza [806] and its\r\nfunction as a court of appeals for the protection of the natives\r\nagainst ecclesiastical tribunals may be said to have constituted acts\r\nin defense of the royal interests as well as in securing the ends of\r\ncommon justice. In restraining church authorities from the intemperate\r\nuse of the interdict, [807] or from a too liberal extension of the\r\nright of asylum, [808] the audiencia was not seeking the ends of\r\njustice (though judicial proceedings were instituted) so much as it\r\nwas defending the royal prerogative and protecting the officials of\r\nthe civil government. This may also be said of its efforts to prevent\r\nthe abuse of power by the commissary of the Inquisition. In these\r\nlast-mentioned activities, therefore, the audiencia may be said to\r\nhave acted in defense of the royal patronage, though in all these\r\ncases its method of procedure was that of a court of justice.\r\n\r\nThe church in the Spanish colonies had its own judicial tribunals\r\nfor the trial and settlement of cases arising within it which did not\r\nconcern the civil government. [809] The division of authority between\r\nthe civil and ecclesiastical courts and the respective jurisdictions\r\nof each are described by Professor Moses, who writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The courts of the civil government and not the ecclesiastical\r\n    authorities considered ... all questions involving the limits\r\n    of bishoprics, the rights and prerogatives of the holders of\r\n    benefices, controversies between ecclesiastical councils and\r\n    their bishops and archbishops concerning the administration\r\n    of the Church, all disputes between parish priests and their\r\n    parishes, in a word, all cases that in any manner touched the royal\r\n    patronage. Even matters spiritual and cases between persons of a\r\n    privileged tribunal were not excepted from the civil jurisdiction;\r\n    but certain cases might be brought before the viceroy, and, if\r\n    desired, an appeal might be taken from the viceroy's decision to\r\n    the audiencia. [810]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be our function in this chapter to determine the participation\r\nof the civil courts in these matters.\r\n\r\nThe power of intervention in ecclesiastical matters which was\r\nexercised by the civil tribunals was always a source of discord\r\nin the Philippines. The attitude of the churchmen on this question\r\nis well shown by a letter written January 20, 1688, by Fray Alonso\r\nLaudín, procurator in Madrid for the Franciscans of the Philippines,\r\nin protest against the encroachments of civil government. He wrote that\r\n\r\n\r\n    the principal causes of trouble in the Philippines are the\r\n    disagreements which continually exist between the royal audiencia\r\n    and the ecclesiastical judges; ... the ministers of the royal\r\n    audiencia, by virtue of the royal patronage of Your Majesty whom\r\n    they represent, ... hold ... that the audiencia has ecclesiastical\r\n    jurisdiction over the Church and over purely ecclesiastical\r\n    persons, over spiritual cases and the administration of the Holy\r\n    Sacrament, ... and spiritual and territorial jurisdiction in\r\n    regular and secular parishes. [811]\r\n\r\n\r\nLaudín described the helplessness of the ecclesiastical judges and the\r\nineffectiveness of their jurisdiction, circumscribed as it was by that\r\nof the civil magistrates. He stated that all the judicial acts of the\r\necclesiastical ordinaries were rendered null by the magistrates of\r\nthe audiencia and that the ecclesiastical authorities were reduced\r\nto such a condition that they did not know where to turn for relief\r\nor remedy, as even the papal decrees were rendered ineffectual by\r\nthe encroachments of the civil jurisdiction. He stated that \"the\r\necclesiastical judges see in all this a meddling and interference\r\nwith the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, which has always been allowed,\r\nbut they cannot hereafter give fulfillment to the provisions of the\r\naudiencia, even at the risk of expulsion from their districts.\" Laudín\r\nwas of the opinion that the laws had been misinterpreted by the civil\r\nofficials and that the king had never intended that the churchmen\r\nshould be so entirely shorn of their powers. He concluded his appeal\r\nwith the solicitation that such laws should be made as would determine\r\nthe questions at issue and bring about harmony between church and\r\nstate in the Islands. This should be done, he said, \"in order that\r\neach may be caused to see clearly the duties and jurisdiction which\r\nbelongs to him and that each may freely make use of his own powers\r\nand prerogatives, and thus avoid suits and other disagreements.\"\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Indies prescribed that the most harmonious\r\nrelations should prevail between the ecclesiastical and civil\r\nmagistrates. The audiencia was commanded to aid the prelates and\r\necclesiastical magistrates in the exercise of their jurisdiction,\r\nneither interfering with them nor permitting them to be molested by\r\nother civil authorities. [812] These laws, like those of the royal\r\npatronage, not only gave to the civil government a commanding position\r\nwith relation to the church, but they established the magistrates as\r\nthe supervisors and guardians of the church courts.\r\n\r\nIt was the duty of the audiencia, on the other hand, to guard strictly\r\nthe prerogatives of the civil magistrates, and, in fact, those of all\r\nofficials of the government, and not to allow the ecclesiastics to\r\ninfringe on their jurisdiction through acts of fuerza, interdicts,\r\nor by any other illegal means. [813] The ecclesiastical courts were\r\nforbidden to try laymen or those subject in first instance to the\r\njurisdiction of the civil courts. They were forbidden to imprison\r\nprivate subjects, or embargo or sell their property without first\r\nseeking the consent and co-operation of the secular arm. [814] They\r\nwere forbidden to try any cases except those involving the church, and\r\nthey could not, without the aid of the civil authorities, impose fines\r\nor condemn persons to labor. [815] In general, they were solicited\r\nto work in harmony with the audiencia, and to give all possible\r\nassistance to that body. [816] Wherein doubt existed or where there\r\nwas reason to believe that an action might constitute an interference\r\nwith the civil prerogative, the ecclesiastical judges were ordered\r\nto ask the advice of the secular authorities. The ecclesiastical and\r\nsecular magistrates were enjoined to aid each other actively when\r\noccasion demanded, the prelates supporting the audiencia, and the\r\nlatter dispatching provisions to its magistrates and subdelegates in\r\nsupport of the ecclesiastical judges and tribunals. [817]\r\n\r\nThe laws cited above did not become effective suddenly, but were\r\nevolved through a long period of dissension and dispute between\r\nthe ecclesiastical and the civil authorities. Before the audiencia\r\nwas established in the Islands, the parish priests, friars, and\r\necclesiastical ordinaries in many cases exercised the duties of local\r\njudges in both the spiritual and temporal spheres. There can be no\r\nquestion but that the church rendered very efficient service in this\r\nparticular, especially under the leadership of Bishop Salazar. [818]\r\n\r\nThe surrender of their prerogatives by the ecclesiastics was\r\ngradually though reluctantly made as the civil courts became more\r\nfirmly established in the Islands. At first, the entire clergy, with\r\nfew exceptions, from the bishop to the most isolated parish priest,\r\nopposed the change, and regarded the assumption of their former\r\npowers by the civil authorities as unauthorized usurpation. [819]\r\nIt was with great difficulty that the churchmen were able to adjust\r\nthemselves to the new conditions. They were required frequently\r\nto aid the civil authorities in the apprehension of criminals and\r\nin the obtaining of testimony, thus co-operating generally in the\r\nadministration of justice. [820] A noteworthy conflict arose when the\r\naudiencia summoned Bishop Salazar before it to testify as an ordinary\r\nwitness, and to explain his own actions on various occasions, in\r\nretarding the work of the civil courts. These summonses he regarded\r\nas detracting from his ecclesiastical immunity. Subsequently, the\r\naudiencia was admonished that on no occasion should churchmen be\r\ncalled to act as witnesses. [821] So it came about that although the\r\nintervention of the audiencia was prescribed by the laws of the Indies\r\nand admitted elsewhere in the Philippines, owing to the strength of\r\nthe ecclesiastical organization, and its former prominence in affairs\r\nof government, the assumption of its legal power by the audiencia was\r\nnecessarily gradual. Nevertheless, the tribunal ultimately attained\r\nextensive authority in ecclesiastical affairs, an analysis of which\r\nwill now be made.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia exercised jurisdiction as a high court of appeal over\r\nsuits to which the religious orders were parties. Most of these cases\r\noriginated in misunderstandings or contentions over jurisdiction,\r\ntitles to land, and over the claims relating to occupation of provinces\r\nunder the royal patronage, which the various orders advanced. Most\r\nfrequent of all were the suits between the orders, as to jurisdiction\r\nover provinces. An example of this is furnished by the contention\r\nwhich arose in 1736 between the Jesuits and the Recollects for the\r\nexclusive right to minister in Mindanao. Another case of a similar\r\nnature was the adjudication of a dispute between the Recollects and\r\nthe Dominicans for spiritual jurisdiction in the province of Zambales,\r\nas a result of which the Recollects were finally ordered to confine\r\ntheir missionary activities to Mindoro. [822] Another case was the\r\ndispute between the Franciscans and the Observant friars. A large\r\nnumber of the latter arrived in the Islands in 1648 with letters from\r\nthe Viceroy of New Spain. They were at once given territory which had\r\nbeen previously assigned to the Franciscans. On the basis of a brief\r\nof Urban VIII, prohibiting the occupation of the same province by\r\ntwo different orders, the Franciscans brought suit in the audiencia\r\nwith the result that the newcomers were not only dispossessed of the\r\nprovince that had been assigned to them, but their patents and briefs\r\nwere cancelled on the grounds that they were not properly authorized\r\nby the Council of the Indies. [823]\r\n\r\nReference was made in the last chapter to the suits which occurred\r\nbetween the Jesuits and Dominicans, the two orders most extensively\r\ninterested in higher education, for the right to maintain universities\r\nin Manila. The greater number of these disputes, in fact all of them,\r\nseem to have been based on the rivalry of their two colleges and on\r\ntheir zeal for royal favor and patronage. When Santo Tomás became a\r\nroyal university in 1648, and was empowered to grant degrees as such,\r\nthe Jesuits brought suit in the audiencia for the right to confer\r\nhonors of a like character in their college of San José. The audiencia\r\ndenied their petition; the case was appealed to the Council of the\r\nIndies, and the higher authority decided that both institutions should\r\nenjoy equally the privilege of conferring scholastic honors. [824]\r\nThe rivalry and bitter feeling between these two orders did not\r\ncease with this settlement, but in 1683 the Dominicans again brought\r\nsuit in the audiencia, seeking to limit the educational activities\r\nof the Jesuits. The matter was again carried to the Council of the\r\nIndies. Although the decision was made in favor of the Jesuits, the\r\ndisagreements between the two orders, the charges and counter-charges,\r\nand the influence of Archbishop Pardo, a Dominican, in behalf of\r\nhis own order, went far beyond the authority of the audiencia, whose\r\nefforts to restrain them were entirely ineffectual. [825]\r\n\r\nEven the natives themselves, at times, went so far as to sue the\r\nreligious orders in the audiencia. This was done in 1738 when the\r\nmestizos of Santa Cruz brought suit against the Jesuits, because the\r\nlatter had sought to make the residents of Santa Cruz pay for certain\r\nimprovements in the parishes of that district. These improvements had\r\nbeen authorized by the Jesuits, and from them the society had derived\r\ngreat benefit, while the residents had derived no particular good from\r\nthem. [826] In 1737, on complaint of the natives, an investigation was\r\nconducted by Oidor Calderón which put a check upon certain transactions\r\nof the Jesuits in the province of Batangas. It was proved that they\r\nhad collected rents repeatedly from the Indians for lands to which\r\nthey had no title.\r\n\r\nThe most significant and decisive judicial authority which the\r\naudiencia exercised in ecclesiastical matters, and that which was\r\nproductive of more conflicts and opposition on the part of the church\r\nthan any other cause, was the jurisdiction of the tribunal over\r\nthe secular church courts, at the head of which was the metropolitan\r\ntribunal of the archbishop. The method of intervention most frequently\r\nfollowed in cases appealed from the archbishop was by the entertainment\r\nof the recurso de fuerza. [827] In this way the civil jurisdiction,\r\nacting through the audiencia, could intervene for its own protection,\r\nand by means of this special procedure that tribunal actually did\r\nrestrain the ecclesiastical judges more frequently and effectively\r\nin important cases than in any other way. It was on the grounds of\r\nfuerza that the audiencia justified its action in practically all\r\ncases of interference with the jurisdiction of the church courts.\r\n\r\nCases of fuerza were those which came to the audiencia through the\r\nabuse of their judicial powers by prelates or ecclesiastical judges;\r\ncases, literally, in which the latter had usurped or trespassed the\r\nauthority of the civil courts or government. [828] The execution of\r\nthe decision of an ecclesiastical judge could be suspended by an edict\r\nof the audiencia on the grounds of fuerza, while the case was being\r\ninvestigated by that tribunal. [829] The civil government usually\r\ntook the initiative in these appeals, but there were occasions in\r\nthe history of the Islands in which ecclesiastical authorities and\r\ntribunals interposed recursos de fuerza against the archbishop. In\r\ndealing with these cases the audiencia first ascertained whether fuerza\r\nhad been committed and then, if the results of the investigation\r\nwere affirmative, the tribunal was empowered to raise the fuerza\r\n(alzar or quitar la fuerza) [830] and place limitations upon\r\nthe ecclesiastical authority in order to prevent future abuse of\r\npower. [831] The audiencia was without authority to fine prelates,\r\nbishops, or ecclesiastical judges, but it had sufficient jurisdiction\r\nto remedy excesses and restore conditions to their former state. The\r\ntribunal was urged to use the utmost discretion in dispossessing\r\noffending prelates and judges of their benefices or positions, [832]\r\nas a punishment for fuerza, and not to proceed to such lengths except\r\nin exceptional cases, wherein the strictest measures were necessary. On\r\nsuch occasions the audiencia might exile the offending ecclesiastic,\r\ngiving account of its act to the Council of the Indies. [833] All\r\nproceedings of this nature had to be carried on secretly and with\r\nthe greatest possible dispatch and brevity, [834] and all churchmen\r\nwho were deprived of their benefices through the recurso de fuerza\r\nhad the privilege of an appeal to the Council of the Indies. [835]\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of cases of fuerza an informal judicial hearing\r\nwas given; the spirit of the proceeding was supposed to be that of\r\na harmonious investigation, in which both sides, ecclesiastical and\r\ncivil, were mutually and equally concerned in the solution of a given\r\nproblem, and in ascertaining wherein error had been committed. The\r\nobject of this proceeding was said to be the furtherance of the\r\ninterests of the crown, the salvation of souls and the spread of\r\nthe benevolent influence of the church. That the spirit of peace and\r\nharmony failed to manifest itself at many of these investigations,\r\nis shown by the bitter contests which arose between the civil and\r\necclesiastical judges as results of the entertainment of the recurso\r\nde fuerza. The spiritual authorities alleged on these occasions that\r\nthey regarded the restraining action of the government as presumption,\r\nunauthorized by ecclesiastical canons.\r\n\r\nIn the well-known Pardo controversy (1683-1689), references to which\r\nmay be found in any history of the Philippines, there occurred many\r\noccasions on which the audiencia was obliged to avail itself of the\r\nrecurso de fuerza. By this means the audiencia sought to restrain\r\nArchbishop Pardo from usurping the civil jurisdiction and that of the\r\nreligious orders and of the metropolitan chapter. Interference with\r\nthese orders was in violation of the royal patronage, the ultimate\r\nauthority over them being the patron and not the archbishop. Such\r\naction, therefore, became a civil offense, punishable by the civil\r\ntribunals, the highest of which and the one properly equipped to\r\ndeal with such cases, was the audiencia. It will be noted that Pardo\r\npaid the penalty of exile for repeatedly ignoring the audiencia and\r\nits right of interposition through the recurso de fuerza, and the\r\nsubsequent ineffectiveness of the audiencia was due to reasons and\r\nconditions other than the decline of the authority and importance of\r\nthe recurso de fuerza. This controversy which is more fully described\r\nin preceding chapters affords the best example extant of the operation\r\nof the recurso de fuerza, its nature and effects, hence the citation\r\nof minor cases is rendered unnecessary.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the question of fuerza as illustrating the\r\njurisdiction of the audiencia over the church courts, occurs that\r\nof the interdict. A price which the civil authorities frequently\r\nhad to pay for the entertainment of the recurso de fuerza, or any\r\nother opposition, in fact, to the unrestricted authority of the\r\necclesiastics, was the penalty which usually accompanied the interdict,\r\nof being forbidden to participate in religious rites and ceremonies,\r\nor to continue receiving the customary spiritual consolations and\r\nbenefits of the church. [836] The authority of the audiencia to\r\nrestrain the excessive use of this weapon by the ecclesiastics may be\r\nconsidered to have been judicial in its nature, since the prelates, by\r\nundue use of the episcopal censure, went beyond their ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction and encroached upon the royal prerogative. A form of\r\njudicial inquiry was instituted to ascertain the act and degree\r\nof encroachment; indeed, the excessive use of the interdict was\r\ninterpreted to constitute fuerza, and the method just described was\r\nemployed by the tribunal to combat it.\r\n\r\nWe may turn again to the Pardo controversy for an example of the\r\nintervention of the audiencia to restrain a prelate from excessive\r\nuse of the interdict. Pardo, after his return from exile, fulminated\r\ncensures against ex-Governor Juan de Vargas and the entire audiencia\r\nwhich had supported him against the archbishop. The ban against\r\nthe oidores was quickly removed, technically on the grounds that\r\nthe magistrates were still royal officials, but in reality for the\r\nsake of expediency. Vargas, however, was not absolved. The audiencia,\r\naccording to the existing laws, had the right to force the prelate to\r\nremove the ban, [837] but owing to dissensions within the tribunal, the\r\nopposition of the new governor, the increasing power of the archbishop,\r\nthe certainty that the royal authority had already disapproved of its\r\nacts, and the impending visitation of a royal commissioner (Valdivia),\r\nwho had instructions to settle the discord and strife at Manila at\r\nany cost, the oidores thought it best not to take this step. The\r\narchbishop refused to absolve Vargas because of the technical reason\r\nthat his case came under the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe audiencia was expected to restrain the interdict whenever\r\nthis ecclesiastical prohibition interfered with the government or\r\nincapacitated the officials thereof from executing their duties. The\r\ninterdict was not to interfere with the royal prerogative, nor was\r\nit to be imposed for insignificant causes or personal reasons. [838]\r\nThe audiencia was given the special injunction not to interfere\r\nwith censures generally, but to permit them to be applied in needful\r\ncases, the oidores bearing in mind only the requirement that these\r\necclesiastical measures should not be allowed to interfere with the\r\ncivil government. [839]\r\n\r\nIt had frequently been the practice of the prelates to pronounce\r\ncensures against oidores and alcaldes, who, in proceeding with\r\ntheir duties as inspectors of the provinces, encroached upon\r\nwhat the churchmen regarded as their own particular and private\r\njurisdiction. This, of course, was forbidden, and the audiencia,\r\nby way of fuerza, usually entertained appeals from these officials\r\nof the civil government and set aside all such acts on the part\r\nof the representatives of the church. Reference was made in the\r\nlast chapter to the circumstances surrounding the effort of Oidor\r\nGuerela to inspect the province of Camarines. This magistrate was\r\nexcommunicated by the bishop of that diocese and was compelled to\r\nremain in banishment five months, the audiencia refusing to set aside\r\nthe censure on account of the personal animosity of the magistrates\r\ntoward Guerela. Nevertheless, prelates were enjoined to obey the\r\naudiencia when that tribunal ordered the cancellation or suspension\r\nof an episcopal censure or prohibition. [840] When an appeal was\r\nmade to the audiencia from such an act by an alcalde, oidor, visitor,\r\nor other official at some distance from the capital, the prelate was\r\nexpected, upon the judicial summons of the audiencia, to suspend his\r\ncensure until the facts of the case had been ascertained, and the\r\ndecision of the tribunal had been rendered. [841] This was the law,\r\nbut occasionally, as in the case of Guerela, local circumstances\r\nrendered impossible or undesirable the fulfillment of the law.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in the preceding chapter that before the coming of\r\nthe audiencia, the church had utilized the weapon of excommunication\r\non very slight pretext, and it had been partly for the purpose of\r\nrestraining this abuse that the audiencia was established. [842] The\r\nearly governors, especially, had many difficulties with this phase of\r\necclesiastical high-handedness and the letters of such executives as\r\nDe Vera, Tello, Dasmariñas, and Morga complained continually against\r\nthis particular abuse of power by the prelates, [843] regretting\r\nthe lack of any authority to set aside these excessive acts on the\r\npart of the churchmen. All the above-mentioned governors had been\r\nexcommunicated for various acts in opposition to the ecclesiastical\r\npower. Governor Ronquillo, in the characteristic letter which is\r\nquoted in another part of this treatise, reported that the audiencia,\r\nafter its establishment, had effectively restrained the excesses\r\nof excommunication on the part of the church. [844] Indeed, during\r\nthe twenty-five years succeeding Ronquillo's term as governor, the\r\naudiencia had so frequently set aside ecclesiastical censures, and\r\nso completely terminated the abuses of the privilege of sanctuary by\r\nfriars and priests, in fact so generally held at naught the principle\r\nof ecclesiastical immunity, that the king, on November 13, 1626, was\r\nobliged to issue a special cédula in restraint of his Manila tribunal\r\nand for the protection of the ecclesiastical jurisdictions. [845]\r\n\r\nExamination of a large number of cases shows that the method by which\r\nthe audiencia set aside excommunication was usually through an ultimate\r\nreliance on force. Nevertheless, taking three hundred years of the\r\nhistory of the Philippines into consideration, there were relatively\r\nfew cases in which matters went so far that the audiencia actually had\r\nto use force, the case being usually that the judicial protest of the\r\ntribunal against an abuse of this kind was sufficient. Theoretically,\r\nany act of excommunication or interdict was suspended, ipso facto,\r\nby the intervention of the audiencia pending further investigation,\r\nand the prelate was required to abide by the decision of the tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe following typical cases may be cited to show that the audiencia\r\nfrequently did rely on the civil power, as a last resort, for the\r\nenforcement of its injunctions. In 1623, an oidor was excommunicated\r\nfor having violated the ecclesiastical sanctuary in seizing Juan\r\nSoto de Vega, a fugitive from justice, who had taken refuge in the\r\ncathedral. The audiencia, finding itself opposed by the metropolitan\r\ncourt, sent a constable to arrest the provisor who had fulminated\r\nthe excommunication, threatening the latter with a fine of two\r\nthousand pesos and banishment if he did not desist and cancel the\r\ncensure. The archbishop, who at first supported the provisor, was put\r\nunder military guard at the behest of the audiencia. The Jesuits then\r\nused their good offices in behalf of the government, as a result of\r\nwhich the matter was arbitrated and peace was brought about. [846]\r\nIn 1636, however, the archbishop and provisor were banished and fined\r\nheavily, because they persisted in a censure which the audiencia\r\nhad restrained. Their continual refusal to harken to the commands\r\nof the vicepatron and the royal tribunal and their insistence on the\r\ncensure were adjudged to constitute fuerza. This case originated in\r\nthe violation of the right of asylum by the governor and the arrest\r\nof a murderer who had taken refuge in the Augustinian convent. So\r\nopen was the defiance of the civil government that the criminal was\r\nexecuted in the courtyard, under the very windows of the convent\r\nwherein were congregated the prelate and his supporters who were\r\ncommanded not to touch the body for three days. [847] The archbishop\r\nwas removed from his convent by soldiers at the command of the acuerdo\r\nand banished to the island of Corregidor, where he remained twenty-six\r\ndays, after which mediation was effected and the weak old prelate,\r\ntottering with age, was restored to his metropolitan capital. [848]\r\nMontero y Vidal states that this case is interesting and important as\r\na test of the power of the governor; for many persons, he alleges,\r\ndid not believe that the governor could raise an interdict. [849]\r\nThat he was enabled to do so, with the support of the audiencia and\r\nwith the aid of his military forces there can be no question.\r\n\r\nSome reference should be made at this time to the abuses of the\r\ninterdict by Archbishop Pardo. This prelate went so far as to place\r\na ban upon the church of the Jesuits because it contained the dead\r\nbody of an offending oidor. For reasons other than the lack of legal\r\nauthority, the audiencia was powerless to restrain his censures at\r\nthat time. On another occasion the audiencia and governor, by placing\r\narmed guards at the doors of the Dominican church and preventing\r\nthe celebration of services therein, suppressed an interdict which\r\nhad been issued through the influence of that order on behalf of\r\nArchbishop Pardo. Governor Bustamante claimed that he was acting\r\nin accordance with his own properly constituted authority in 1719,\r\nwhen he appointed his own audiencia, set aside repeated interdicts,\r\npenetrated the asylum of the church, arrested the archbishop and defied\r\nthe entire ecclesiastical organization. He seems to have exceeded\r\nhis powers no more flagrantly than did some of his predecessors\r\nunder like circumstances; yet, for personal and political reasons,\r\nhe was unable to count on the support of the other elements of the\r\ncolony in this struggle with the ecclesiastical power and the battle\r\nended disastrously for him. Acting-Governor Anda, relying on armed\r\nforce alone, defended Manila against the British, achieved victory\r\nfor his cause and secured the approbation of the king in the face of\r\nrepeated ecclesiastical censures from Archbishop Rojo. These incidents,\r\nwhich occupy a prominent place in the history of the Philippines,\r\nillustrate the usual method by which ecclesiastical censures were set\r\naside in actual practice, either by the audiencia or by the vicepatron,\r\nwho was supported by the tribunal.\r\n\r\nA department of the church over which the audiencia did not have\r\nsuch complete authority, either judicially or administratively, was\r\nthe Inquisition. Properly speaking, there was no tribunal of the Holy\r\nOffice in the Philippines, the Inquisition being represented in Manila\r\nby a commissary. [850] This representative was sufficiently powerful,\r\nhowever, to constitute a worthy opponent for the civil power and one\r\nwho, on account of the immunities which he enjoyed and because of the\r\nsecret methods which he was able to employ, kept all the tribunals\r\nand authorities of the civil government at a respectful distance.\r\n\r\nAlthough the laws of the Indies directed that the inquisitors who were\r\nsent to the colonies should present their titles to the audiencias and\r\nviceroys, this did not give the civil authorities any advantage over\r\nthem. The audiencia was expected to formally receive the inquisitors\r\nand to pay them all due respect. [851] At the time of the establishment\r\nof the Inquisition in Manila, no audiencia as yet existed. From the\r\nvery beginning, however, the dignitaries of the Inquisition were\r\nplaced under special royal protection, with complete power over\r\ntheir own sphere. Officials of the government and all other persons\r\nwere warned and enjoined not to interfere with or oppose them in any\r\nway. As early as May 22, 1610, the Council of the Indies placed itself\r\nand all subordinate audiencias and governors in a position inferior\r\nto that of the Inquisition. The interference of civil magistrates\r\nwith the inquisitors in behalf of the government was forbidden, [852]\r\neven the ordinary means of protection were denied them. The recurso\r\nde fuerza could not be employed, nor could the interdicts of the\r\ninquisitors be raised, even in notorious cases of their infringement\r\nupon the royal jurisdiction. [853] Little change was made in these\r\nlaws until the latter part of the eighteenth century. The oidores\r\nwere ordered to lend such secular aid as might be required, and were\r\noriginally instructed to obey the mandates and carry out the orders of\r\nthe inquisitors without inquiries into the religious reason for any\r\naction the latter might take. Each judge, ecclesiastical or royal,\r\nwas to limit himself strictly to his own particular field and thus\r\nconflicts of authority were to be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Indies prescribed many regulations which were\r\ndesigned to induce harmony and co-operation between the officials\r\nof the Inquisition and those of the civil government. Viceroys,\r\naudiencias and governors were authorized to execute the sentences of\r\nthe representatives of the Inquisition and to extend to them every\r\nfacility and assistance. [854] Oidores and executives were forbidden\r\nto open the mail or tamper with the correspondence or legal documents\r\nof the inquisitors. [855] Oidores and fiscales were authorized to\r\ngive legal advice to the judges of the Inquisition when counsel\r\nof this kind was required. [856] The inquisitors were to be given\r\nprecedence over the officials of the civil government in everything\r\npertaining to the official duties of the former, but in questions of\r\ncivil administration and in matters of ceremony, the oidores took\r\nprecedence over inquisitors, unless the latter enjoyed higher rank\r\nby virtue of some other office. [857]\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the laws, however, through a period of two hundred\r\nyears, was to delimit and circumscribe the authority of the Inquisition\r\nin matters bordering on the jurisdiction of the civil government. This\r\nis seen, especially, in the offense of polygamy, which, up to 1754,\r\nwas dealt with solely by the Inquisition. By the cédula of March\r\n19th of that year, polygamy was brought under the fuero mixto;\r\n[858] the same law ordered that prisoners, after punishment by the\r\ninquisitorial tribunal for heresy, should be dealt with by civil\r\njudges for an offense against the laws of the realm. On September 7,\r\n1766, this crime was again made punishable solely by the Inquisition,\r\nbut on August 10, 1788, jurisdiction over cases of polygamy was taken\r\nentirely from the Inquisition and given to the royal justices. [859]\r\nThis may be considered as indicative of the decline of the authority\r\nof the Inquisition in the eighteenth century. The inquisitors, of\r\ncourse, were not permitted to exercise jurisdiction over the Chinese,\r\nor over the aboriginal inhabitants of the Islands. [860]\r\n\r\nIn its relations with the civil power in the Philippines, and\r\nparticularly with the audiencia, two charges have been brought\r\nagainst the Inquisition. The first was that in the early years of\r\nthe Islands' history, it was utilized by the prelates for the more\r\ncomplete usurpation of powers belonging to the civil government and the\r\naudiencia. The tribunal, of course, was left entirely without recourse,\r\nby virtue of the exemptions and immunities of the Inquisition mentioned\r\nabove. On July 20, 1585, the audiencia, in a letter to the king,\r\ncited several instances in which Bishop Salazar, unwilling to cede his\r\nclaims to jurisdiction over certain civil offenders, handed them over\r\nto the commissary of the Inquisition, instead of surrendering them\r\nto the audiencia, to which jurisdiction over such cases belonged. The\r\naudiencia, appealing to the king for aid, alleged that the prelate had\r\ntaken undue advantage of the civil power, \"by sheltering himself behind\r\nthe Inquisition, ... where the audiencia has no jurisdiction.\" [861]\r\nThis charge was also brought against Salazar by the Jesuit, Sánchez,\r\nin his memorial of 1591. [862] It is significant that no decree was\r\nissued during the earlier era which authorized the audiencia to repair\r\nthe abuses of the inquisitors, although on many occasions the audiencia\r\nand the local court of the Inquisition were respectively enjoined to\r\nconfine themselves to their own particular fields of authority. [863]\r\n\r\nThe second charge made against the Inquisition was that it allowed\r\nitself to be influenced, utilized, and possessed by individuals\r\nand private interests for their own selfish ends. Under these\r\nconditions the audiencia was powerless; the Inquisition openly\r\nfought the government and vanquished it entirely on various notable\r\noccasions. There may be found no better illustration of this than\r\nthe Salcedo affair in 1667 and 1668, during which the commissary\r\nof the Inquisition was the instrument of the governor's enemies,\r\nproceeding to such excesses in his zeal that he ultimately proved to\r\nbe the agent of his own downfall. [864]\r\n\r\nThe various sacerdotal historians of the Philippines, in treating\r\nof the Salcedo affair, agree that the failure of the audiencia to\r\ndo its duty in checking the so-called excesses of the governor led\r\nthe prelate and the ecclesiastical dignitaries of the colony to\r\nturn to the Inquisition for relief. [865] Among the acts of treason\r\nand heresy of which Governor Salcedo was said to have been guilty,\r\nthe most conspicuous were his negotiations with the Dutch at Batavia\r\nfor the conquest by them of the city of Manila. [866] This was the\r\nleading pretext for his arrest. We have already mentioned in a former\r\nchapter that the conduct of the oidores was not above reproach on this\r\noccasion. Immediately after the removal of the governor, a dispute\r\narose between magistrates Coloma and Montemayor for the control of\r\naffairs, only to be settled by the usurpation of the government by\r\nthe ecclesiastical candidate, Bónifaz. With Salcedo out of the way\r\nand the audiencia intimidated and powerless, the Inquisition and the\r\necclesiastics ruled with a high hand for a period of three years,\r\nuntil the arrival of the new governor, Manuel de León, in 1671. [867]\r\n\r\nThe audiencia, after it had been reconstructed by Governor León,\r\ngave some account to the king of the excesses of \"Fray Joseph de\r\nPaternina, religious of the order of San Agustín, and commissary\r\nof the Holy Inquisition, who has been so vain and haughty since\r\nthe imprisonment of Governor Salcedo, a thing very unfortunate\r\nfor these Islands.\" [868] The most harmful result of the affair,\r\nin the estimation of the audiencia, was the growing feeling on the\r\npart of the people of the Philippines \"that the Inquisition (was)\r\nthe most powerful agency there, and that every person in the colony\r\nwas subject to it.\" The effrontery of the commissary was said to have\r\ngone so far on one occasion that he entered the acuerdo session of\r\nthe audiencia and violently interfered with its proceedings, forcibly\r\narresting and carrying away persons attendant thereupon. This defiant\r\nand insolent act was the greatest offense that could be offered to\r\nthe royal authority, and the audiencia felt that if a continuance of\r\nthese excesses were tolerated the royal tribunal would be despised\r\nand held at naught by the very citizens who should regard it with\r\nthe most veneration.\r\n\r\nA list of the acts of aggression on the part of the commissary was\r\nsubmitted by the audiencia at this time. He had commuted a sentence\r\npronounced by the tribunal and had excused various fines imposed\r\nby the tribunal, declaring publicly that it was not necessary to\r\nobey the acts of this body of lawyers. He had excommunicated all the\r\nmagistrates of the audiencia, who remained for a long period without\r\nrecourse and without the privileges of religious communion. He had\r\ninterfered on behalf of an encomendero who was on trial before\r\nthe audiencia. He had produced such a state of affairs that the\r\nimpotence of the civil government was a subject of common jest, even\r\nin the mouths of the natives. The supporters of the government had\r\nbeen reduced to a panic of fear, not knowing where the wrath of the\r\nInquisition would fall next. The commissary, on the other hand, had\r\nfortified himself with claims of immunity and had acted in defiance\r\nof royal and ecclesiastical law by erecting a tribunal of which he\r\nwas the head, notwithstanding the fact that such an institution was\r\nforbidden in the Philippines. The audiencia presented this picture\r\nof affairs in its memorial, admitting its incapacity to cope with\r\nthis powerful institution, whose acts were prepared and executed in\r\nsecrecy. The evil situation for which he was responsible could only be\r\nrepaired by an appeal to Mexico. Meanwhile the government and people\r\nin the Philippines were compelled to suffer the consequences of his\r\nassumption of authority.\r\n\r\nThere was no tribunal or any other agency in the Philippines able to\r\nplace an effective check on the triumphant inquisitor. The only relief\r\nthat could come was furnished on June 4, 1671, in the appointment of a\r\nnew commissary, who was ordered to arrest Paternina and send him back\r\nto New Spain. This timely relief emanated from the tribunal of the\r\nInquisition of Mexico, which by this act manifested its disapproval\r\nof all that had been done by its ambitious agent. On August 12, 1672,\r\nthe Council of the Indies also disapproved of Paternina's acts in\r\nconnection with the establishment of a Philippine tribunal. [869]\r\nThe new commissary did nothing toward the continuance of the tribunal\r\nwhich his predecessor had established illegally.\r\n\r\nWith these manifestations of the royal support, the audiencia,\r\nwhich had been reconstituted on the arrival of Governor León,\r\nregained its authority and proceeded ably to second the executive\r\nin his struggle with the powerful ecclesiastical organization. The\r\nnew commissary, who had lost his papers in a shipwreck, appealed to\r\nthe tribunal for recognition and support in a struggle which he had\r\nundertaken against the Franciscans. Through the aid given him by\r\nthe audiencia, he imprisoned the provincial and definitor of that\r\norder. Then the audiencia reconsidered its decision and effected\r\nthe liberation of the two prisoners on the ground that the title of\r\nthe commissary did not authorize him to act at this time. [870] In\r\ninterfering with and actually cancelling the acts of the commissary,\r\nthe audiencia was exceeding its authority, for the laws prescribed\r\nthat his decisions could be reversed only by his immediate superior,\r\nthe tribunal of Mexico. However, the audiencia maintained that it\r\nwas acting in accordance with the law which authorized it to receive\r\nand recognize inquisitors. On this occasion it was merely deciding\r\nthat the commissary was acting without proper authority since his\r\ncredentials had never arrived. [871] At this time, the moral standing\r\nof the Philippine agent of the Inquisition was at a very low ebb,\r\nboth in Manila and Madrid, which, of course, influenced the decision\r\nof the audiencia.\r\n\r\nThe Salcedo affair and the succeeding events make it clear that\r\nneither the authority of the audiencia nor of the Inquisition was\r\nunlimited. The fear and respect with which the latter institution\r\nwas regarded contributed to its momentary triumph. The audiencia did\r\nnot interfere with or seek to restrain the acts of the commissary;\r\nindeed, the tribunal connived at the exile of the vicepatron since the\r\noidores expected to profit from the act. During these three years the\r\nInquisition allied itself practically to every interest in the colony\r\nwhich had been opposed to the governor. The royal interests were\r\nfor a time forgotten and wholly unchampioned, owing to the weakness\r\nof the audiencia, the removal of the governor, and the united front\r\npresented by the ecclesiastical element. This condition was altered by\r\nthe arrival of a new governor who bore evidence of the disapprobation\r\nof the superior government. The tribunal of Mexico discountenanced the\r\nacts of its former representative, and that disapproval was further\r\nemphasized by the adverse attitude of the Council of the Indies. The\r\naudiencia was restored to its proper position, and, in conjunction\r\nwith the vicepatron, it resumed its status as the agent of the royal\r\nwill. So it may be asserted that the supremacy of both authorities\r\nwas relative, recognition depending partially on local circumstances\r\nand ultimately on the attitude of the superior government. In fact, it\r\nmay be said that the latter was the deciding factor. In the struggle\r\nitself, before the decision of the home authorities was rendered,\r\nthe preponderance of power was enjoyed by the Inquisition. This was\r\nowing to the advantages which law and precedent had given to it as\r\na privileged ecclesiastical tribunal, although the efficacy of the\r\nInquisition lay for the most part in the immunities which were extended\r\nto it and in its swift, unexpected and secret methods. Its ultimate\r\ndefeat on this occasion, and the continued abuse of its power, did much\r\nto detract from its prestige and authority in the Philippines. [872]\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century considerable authority over the\r\nInquisition was given to the civil courts. The former position of\r\nsupremacy, wherein its authority could not be so much as questioned\r\nby a secular tribunal, was gone forever. On August 2, 1748, a decree\r\nwas promulgated whereby chanceries, audiencias, and corregidores were\r\nauthorized to restrain any inquisitorial tribunal from maltreating\r\nits own prisoners. [873] This same law provided for the punishment by\r\nthe civil courts of inquisitors who contravened this law. This was the\r\nfirst regulation which really gave to the audiencia the power necessary\r\nto restrain the acts of the Inquisition. We find no indication of any\r\nsuch liberal legislation in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\r\nbut by the time this law was promulgated, the power of the church in\r\nSpain was considerably reduced and that of the Inquisition was already\r\non the decline. By a number of subsequent laws the Inquisition was\r\ngradually but surely limited in power and authority. We have already\r\nnoted that on August 10, 1788, jurisdiction over the crime of polygamy\r\nand over cases involving the infraction of the marriage relation\r\nwas taken from the Inquisition and given to the civil courts. [874]\r\nBy the cédula of December 12, 1807, authority was given to the royal\r\njustices to receive inquisitors, inspect their titles and to assign\r\nthem to their districts, assisting them in all possible ways. The civil\r\nauthorities were ordered to guard against an excessive number of these\r\nfunctionaries. The magistrates were especially instructed to act as\r\nguardians of the royal prerogative in dealing with the representative\r\nof the Inquisition and to report to the superior government on their\r\nrelations with them. By this cédula the authority of the inquisitorial\r\nagents was distinctly limited to matters of faith, with appeal to\r\nthe tribunal of the Inquisition. The magistrates were ordered to see\r\nthat these instructions were followed. [875] In this way the civil\r\nauthorities, and particularly the magistrates of the audiencias,\r\nbecame the guardians of the royal prerogative against the agents of\r\nthe Inquisition, who were kept within the proper bounds of a purely\r\nreligious jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable, did time and space allow it, to illustrate\r\nfurther the jurisdiction of the audiencia over ecclesiastical affairs\r\nby showing in detail the part which the tribunal played in the friar\r\nlands litigation [876] and in the disputes over ecclesiastical\r\nvisitation in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the\r\nPhilippines. It will be sufficient here to state that the government\r\nsought at irregular intervals and with varying degrees of success,\r\nto make the orders prove titles to lands in the same manner that was\r\nrequired of other corporations and individuals. [877] The audiencia,\r\nas a tribunal, and the individual magistrates as special commissioners,\r\nparticipated judicially in the examination of these titles and in\r\nthe correction of the abuses which were discovered. The oidores, when\r\nserving as special magistrates for the verification of these titles,\r\nofficiated in a double capacity. By the very nature of the services\r\nrendered they were judges. They were also agents of the royal patron\r\nand as such they represented the person of the king, ascertaining\r\nwhether the royal rights had been usurped or infringed upon.\r\n\r\nClosely similar to the jurisdiction of the audiencia as a court\r\nof final resort in the testing of the titles to lands occupied\r\nby religious orders was that which it exercised in the matter of\r\necclesiastical visitation. This was a question of a more thoroughly\r\nreligious character which did not concern the civil government\r\nas intimately as did the matter of friar lands. In general,\r\nit may be said that the audiencia was utilized by both sides in\r\nthe various disputes which arose in connection with ecclesiastical\r\nvisitation. During the ecclesiastical administrations of Archbishops\r\nSalazar, Serrano, Poblete, Camacho, Pardo and Justa y Rufina,\r\npractically until the end of the eighteenth century, this question\r\nwas continually agitated. These archbishops attempted to visit and\r\ninspect the curacies which were held by friars in lieu of secular\r\npriests. [878] The archbishops relied on the audiencia for assistance\r\nin the enforcement of their claims and the friars sought its protection\r\nas a court of justice to shield them from the visitation of the\r\nprelate. As in the matter of the friar lands, so in this question,\r\nthe audiencia acted both as a tribunal of justice and as an agent\r\nand champion of the royal patronage. Indeed, the laws of the Indies\r\nestablished the audiencia as a tribunal and as a compelling authority\r\nfor the enforcement of ecclesiastical visitation. [879] The archbishop\r\nwas directed to appeal to the audiencia or vicepatron for assistance\r\nin the subjection of offending curates, [880] but he was forbidden\r\nto visit the regulars in their convents, [881] which, of course,\r\ndid not prevent his visiting them when in charge of curacies. On the\r\nother hand, the audiencia was forbidden to entertain appeals on the\r\nground of fuerza from regulars who objected to the visitation of the\r\nprelates. [882]\r\n\r\nLocal conditions in the Philippines did much toward determining\r\nthe character of the support rendered by the audiencia both to the\r\narchbishops and to the friars. During the later months of the Pardo\r\ncontroversy, when the audiencia had been demoralized by the triumph of\r\nthe archbishop and the visitor, Valdivia, the decision of the tribunal\r\nhad but little weight and the prelate did as he wished in regard to\r\nthe matter of visitation. In Camacho's time, when the friars were on\r\nthe point of leaving the Islands rather than submit to visitation, the\r\naudiencia and the governor wisely counseled moderation and completely\r\nabandoned the obstinate prelate. During Anda's term of office the\r\nquestion was again taken up, but the effort to enforce the principle\r\nwas abandoned because the government could not find seculars, either\r\nSpanish or native, to take the place of the friars who threatened to\r\nleave the Islands if visitation were insisted upon. The magistrates\r\nlikewise rendered invaluable service in imparting legal advice to the\r\nvicepatron, friars and others interested. They also kept the court\r\ninformed as to what was actually transpiring in the colony. It may\r\nbe seen, therefore, that the audiencia participated in two important\r\nways in the enforcement of episcopal visitation. It was primarily a\r\ncourt; it acted as agent of the royal patron. In these capacities the\r\ninfluence of the tribunal was greatest. It also exercised functions of\r\nan advisory character in aiding the authorities concerned to ascertain\r\ntheir rights according to the existing law. [883]\r\n\r\nIn summarizing the results of the investigation with which this chapter\r\nhas been concerned, it may be said that the audiencia constituted a\r\ncourt of appeal in ecclesiastical cases wherein the services of an\r\nimpartial, non-ecclesiastical tribunal were required, or wherein\r\nthe defense of the royal jurisdiction against the aggression of\r\nthe churchmen was involved. In defending the civil government from\r\necclesiastical usurpation the audiencia acted in defense of the royal\r\npatronage. Nevertheless, in the cases noted, namely, in settling\r\ndisputes between orders, between the secular church and the orders,\r\nbetween either of these and the civil government, in entertaining\r\nrecursos de fuerza, in restraining the interdict, and the abuses of the\r\nInquisition, the audiencia acted by judicial process as a tribunal of\r\njustice, and not in the capacity of an administrative committee or an\r\nexecutive agent, as in the cases which have been heretofore described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF PRINTED WORKS CITED\r\n\r\n\r\nAlcedo, Antonio de\r\n\r\n    Diccionario geográfico-histórico de las Indias Occidentales ó\r\n    América. 5 vols.

It is true\r\nthat the jurisdiction of the Audiencia of Manila was confined to a\r\nterritory which was politically and economically of less importance\r\nto Spain and to the world in general than New Spain and Perú. It is\r\nthe conviction of the writer that the distance and isolation of the\r\nPhilippines, their proximity to Japan, China, and the hostile colonies\r\nof the Portuguese and the Dutch, the necessities of self-dependence\r\nand defense, the corruption of the governors and officials and the\r\nproblem of dealing independently with the ecclesiastical organization\r\nwithin the colony, forced the Audiencia of Manila to take upon itself\r\npowers and responsibilities as extensive, at least, as were assumed\r\nby the Audiencia of Mexico.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Título expedido por los Reyes Católicos, 30 de Abril, 1492,\"\r\nin Navarrete, Colección de viages, II, 9-11; also see Vander Linden,\r\nop. cit., 277-283; 338.\r\n\r\n[3] See Altamira, Historia de la civilización española, II, 477-480;\r\nBancroft, History of Central America, I, 247-288; Helps, Spanish\r\nconquest, (1856), I, 187-227:\r\n\r\nIn the Spanish colonies an alcalde was usually an ordinary judge,\r\nnot always trained in the law to the extent of being a letrado or\r\ntogado. An alcalde ordinario or an alcalde de ayuntamiento tried cases\r\nin first instance. An alcalde mayor or an alcalde de partido might try\r\ncases on appeal from these. Generally speaking, alcaldes ordinarios\r\nwere town judges, in contrast to alcaldes mayores who had provincial\r\njurisdiction as well. Alcaldes ordinarios and regidores were members\r\nof the town ayuntamientos or cabildos (municipal councils). Regidores\r\ndid not exercise judicial functions.\r\n\r\n[4] Recopilación de leyes de los reinos de las Indias (hereinafter\r\nto be referred to as the Recopilación), lib. 2, tit. 2, ley 13. For\r\nan account of the Recopilación, see footnote 40, below.\r\n\r\n[5] Bancroft, History of Central America, I, 269; see note 27 of\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\n[6] In some of the early Spanish colonies the alcalde was elected\r\nby his fellow-townsmen. He exercised the functions of judge and\r\nchief executive, subject to the governor, or adelantado, and in the\r\nabsence of the latter assumed the government of the colony. Alcaldes\r\nin new settlements or on expeditions were different in character and\r\nexercised functions distinct from those of the alcaldes of the later\r\nperiods. This earlier type probably existed in Española under Columbus\r\n(see Bancroft, History of Central America, I, 175, 330, note 7). That\r\ntheir duties varied in different colonies may be deduced from the\r\nstatement of Bancroft that \"the alcaldes mayores of New Spain under\r\nCortés were merely entrusted with judicial powers ... later those\r\nof San Luís Potosí and other places acted also as lieutenants for\r\ncaptains-general, and exercised, in other respects, the duties and\r\nceremonies of governors\" (Bancroft, History of Mexico, III, 520). The\r\nterm, therefore, does not always convey a clear impression of the\r\nexact nature of the duties attached to the office.\r\n\r\n[7] Bancroft, History of Central America, I, 269.\r\n\r\n[8] Altamira, Historia, II, 479.\r\n\r\n[9] Bourne, Spain in America. 222; Vander Linden, L'expansion coloniale\r\nde l'Espagne, 339; see note in Bancroft, History of Central America,\r\nI. 280-283.\r\n\r\n[10] Bourne, Spain in America, 222; Moses, The Spanish dependencies\r\nin South America.

In place of these was\r\ncreated the Tribunal Supremo de España é Indias, with judicial\r\nfunctions and a Consejo Real de España é Indias for governmental\r\nand administrative affairs. On September 28, 1836, the Consejo Real\r\nde España é Indias was suppressed. On July 6, 1845, the Consejo de\r\nEstado assumed charge of affairs pertaining to the Indies, with\r\na separate Ministerio de Ultramar. This reform was re-enacted on\r\nSeptember 24, 1853 (Martínez Alcubilla, Diccionario, III, 313-315;\r\nEscriche, Diccionario, I, 578-579).\r\n\r\n[18] It became the practice in later years to reward successful\r\ncolonial administrators, including viceroys, governors, and\r\nmagistrates, with membership in this council. Among those so elevated\r\nwere Juan Solórzano y Pereyra, magistrate of the Audiencia of Perú,\r\nJosé de Gálvez, visitor of New Spain, Governor Simón de Anda y\r\nSalazar, and the able fiscal, Francisco Leandro de Viana, of the\r\nPhilippines. These men rendered very distinguished service in the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\n[19] Recopilación, 2-15-2 to 14; see Danvila y Collado, Reinado de\r\nCarlos III, III, 151-157.

Oidor is sometimes incorrectly\r\ntranslated into \"auditor\", which in English means a reviewer of\r\naccounts (Spanish, contador). The Spanish term auditor has a special\r\nmeaning, referring to a particular kind of magistrate, as auditor de\r\nguerra, auditor de marina or auditor de rota (Escriche, Diccionario, I,\r\n369-371). Blair and Robertson, in their Philippine Islands (Cleveland,\r\n1908), have used the terms oidor and \"auditor\" interchangeably, or\r\nrather, in almost all cases they have translated oidor as \"auditor\",\r\nbut this usage will not be followed here for the reasons given.\r\n\r\n    The oidor is also to be distinguished from the alcalde del\r\n    crimen. The latter existed only in the larger audiencias of\r\n    Mexico and Perú, or in Manila, Havana or Puerto Rico in the\r\n    later nineteenth century. Alcaldes del crimen in the sixteenth,\r\n    seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were subordinate in rank to\r\n    oidores, but by virtue of the reforms of 1812, 1836 and 1837, the\r\n    latter were required to be togados, and the ministers of all the\r\n    audiencias were placed in the same class. (Escriche, Diccionario,\r\n    I, 154; I, 363-369; II, 661; Bancroft, History of Central America,\r\n    I, 297; see also Pérez y López, Teatro de la legislación, XXI,\r\n    351-369; IV, 525-528; Martínez Alcubilla, Diccionario, I, 525-526.)\r\n\r\n[21] The original cédulas refer to this audiencia as La Audiencia\r\nReal de la Nueva España--see Puga, Provisiones, cédulas, f. 7.\r\n\r\n[22] Zamora y Coronado, Biblioteca, I, 452; I, 483-486; Martínez\r\nAlcubilla, Diccionario, VIII, under \"Justicia\".

This\r\nwas the first great general work on the political institutions\r\nof the Indies, and probably the most valuable and comprehensive\r\nof its kind ever published, barring possibly the Recopilación. It\r\ncomprises history, description, law, discussions of suits and cases,\r\nlitigation and legal citations. Its ample title-page states that\r\nit is \"divided into six books, in which, with great distinction\r\nand study, are treated and resolved all matters relating to the\r\ndiscovery, description, acquisition and retention of the Indies,\r\nand their peculiar government, as well as concerning the persons of\r\nthe Indians and their services, tributes, tithes and encomiendas,\r\nas concerning spiritual and ecclesiastical affairs and doctrine,\r\ninquisitors, commissaries of crusade and of the religious. And in\r\nregard to temporal affairs, concerning the secular magistrates,\r\nviceroys, presidents, audiencias, the Supreme Council and its junta\r\nde guerra, including a setting forth of the many royal cédulas which\r\nhave been despatched for the latter.\" Solórzano y Pereyra contributed\r\nlargely to the codification of the laws of the Indies.\r\n\r\n[34] See Chapter X of this book.\r\n\r\n[35] Recurso de fuerza, see footnote 3, Chapter XI of this work.\r\n\r\n[36] The origin and nature of the acuerdo is explained in Chapter VI,\r\nnote 78, of this book; see also Chapter III, note 37.\r\n\r\n[37] The oficiales reales consisted of the tesorero (treasurer),\r\ncontador (accountant) and factor (disbursing officer and supply\r\nagent). See Recopilación, 8-4-34, 35; 8-2-5, 6.\r\n\r\nThe laws of March 2, 1618, and of November 17, 1626, ordered that in\r\ncolonies having audiencias the acuerdos de real hacienda should be\r\nattended by the president (governor or viceroy), fiscal, senior oidor,\r\nand oficial real, respectively. In case there were no audiencia,\r\nthe session should then consist of all the oficiales reales and the\r\ngovernor, and then the votes of the treasury officials should be final\r\n(Recopilación, 8-3-8, 11, 12). Under certain circumstances the factor\r\nwas assisted by a veedor and a proveedor. The duties of the latter\r\nofficials were largely administrative (ibid., 8-4-38 to 39).\r\n\r\nBancroft (History of Mexico, III, 520) states that \"the provinces of\r\nroyal officials [oficiales reales] were merely revenue districts whose\r\nheads received their appointment from the king, and administered\r\ntheir office under a certain supervision from the viceroy and\r\ngovernors attending their councils; yet they were responsible only\r\nto the tribunal of finance in the viceregal capital, and this again\r\nreported direct to Spain.\" See also Priestley, José de Gálvez, 76-82.\r\n\r\n[38] Bull of the Santa Cruzada, the apostolic bull by which the popes\r\nconceded certain indulgences to those who went to the conquest of\r\nJerusalem, and later to the Spaniards who contributed alms to aid\r\nin the war against the Africans. It was called cruzada because\r\nthe soldiers wore crosses as emblems (Escriche, Diccionario, I,\r\n462). Funds for this purpose were raised in the Philippines, paid\r\ninto the insular treasury and deducted from the subsidy at Acapulco\r\n(Recopilación, 1-20-24). As noted above, an oidor acted as asesor of\r\nthese funds (ibid., 2-16-23).\r\n\r\n[39] Solórzano y Pereyra, Política Indiana, II, 271-279.\r\n\r\n[40] The first attempt at the codification of the laws for the\r\ngoverning of the colonies was made in New Spain in 1545, when the\r\nordinances for the government of that viceroyalty and audiencia\r\nwere printed. This collection was given the royal approval in\r\n1548. A similar compilation was made in Perú in 1552 by Viceroy\r\nMendoza. The first intimation of a universal code is to be found\r\nin the recommendations of the fiscal of the Council of the Indies,\r\nFrancisco Hernández de Liebana, in 1552. On September 4, 1560, Luís\r\nVelasco, viceroy of New Spain, was ordered to print a compilation\r\nof laws for the Audiencia of Mexico. This commission was given to\r\nOidor Puga of that tribunal and executed in 1563. In 1569 Viceroy\r\nFrancisco Toledo was ordered to make a similar compilation for Perú,\r\nbut the work was not completed at that time. The first volume actually\r\nprinted by authority of the Council was accomplished in 1593. This\r\nwas the beginning of the code of the Indies, but the volume which was\r\npublished pertained only to the regimen of the Council of the Indies\r\nitself, and made no regulations for the colonies. A more extensive\r\ncollection of provisions, letters, orders and cédulas was published\r\non the authority of the Council by Diego de Encinas, a clerk of that\r\ntribunal, in 1596. In 1603, the Ordenanzas reales para la Casa de\r\nContratación de Sevilla y para otras cosas de las Indias were printed\r\nin the same city. Another ordinance was published for the regulation\r\nof the contaduría mayor.\r\n\r\nVarious compilations were made by the oidores from time to time, either\r\nfor their own use, or in compliance with the royal commands. Among\r\nthe latter, perhaps the most famous and certainly the most useful was\r\nthat of Juan de Solórzano y Pereyra, oidor of the Audiencia of Perú\r\nand later a member of the Council of the Indies. This collection\r\nwas made at Lima in compliance with the commission of Philip IV,\r\nissued in 1610. The work, consisting of six volumes, received\r\nthe stamp of royal approval on July 3, 1627. In 1623 León Pinelo\r\npublished a Discurso sobre la importancia, forma, y disposición de la\r\nrecopilación de leyes de Indias. On April 19 of that year Pinelo was\r\nordered to make an examination of all the existing laws and cédulas\r\nrelative to the government of the colonies, printed or in manuscript,\r\nwith a view to codification. A magistrate named Aguilar y Acuña was\r\nordered to collaborate with him. The result of these proceedings was\r\na Sumario de la Recopilación General, which continued under process of\r\ncompilation for a half century. It was finally perfected and published\r\nin 1677. In 1668 Pinelo's work was issued as the Autos acordados y\r\ndecretos de gobierno del Real y Supremo Consejo de las Indias.\r\n\r\nAlthough the collection was practically ready by 1677, it was not\r\nofficially accepted until May 18, 1680. On that day it was promulgated\r\nby Charles II, king of Spain. On November 1, 1681, the work was ordered\r\npublished by the India House, and the Recopilación de los Reynos de\r\nIndias was issued at Madrid in four volumes. Subsequent editions were\r\nprinted in 1754, 1774, 1791 and 1841. The last-mentioned contains in\r\nits index reforms down to 1820. A Recopilación Sumaria was published in\r\nMexico in two volumes in 1787. The compilations of Zamora y Coronado,\r\nRodríguez San Pedro and Pérez y López, cited repeatedly in this work,\r\ncontain later laws, and serve in the place of the Recopilación for\r\nthe more recent periods.\r\n\r\nAuthorities: Solórzano y Pereyra, Política Indiana, I, Introduction;\r\nG.

See\r\nBancroft, History of Mexico, III, 520; History of Central America,\r\nI, 297; Moses, Establishment of Spanish rule in America, 83.\r\n\r\n[47] Bancroft (History of Central America, I, 297) defines the\r\ncorregidor as a magistrate with civil and criminal jurisdiction in\r\nthe first instance, and gubernatorial inspection in the political\r\nand economic government of all the towns of the district assigned\r\nto him. There were corregidores letrados (learned in the law),\r\ncorregidores políticos (political and administrative), de capa\r\ny espada (military) and políticos y militares (administrative and\r\nmilitary). When the corregidor was not a lawyer by profession, unless\r\nhe had an asesor of his own, the alcalde mayor, if possessed of legal\r\nknowledge, became his advisor, which greatly increased the importance\r\nof the last-mentioned official. The alcalde mayor was appointed by\r\nthe king. It was required that he should be a lawyer by profession,\r\ntwenty-six years of age, and of good character. Practically, in cases\r\nof this kind, when the governor was not a letrado, civil, criminal,\r\nand some phases of military authority devolved on the alcalde mayor;\r\nthe first two ex-officio, and the latter as the legal advisor of the\r\nmilitary chief. In new colonies this officer was invested with powers\r\nalmost equal to those of the governor.--See Recopilación, 5-2.\r\n\r\n[48] The first encomiendas in the Philippines were granted by\r\nLegaspi in 1572 (Montero y Vidal, Historia general, I, 42-43). The\r\nencomenderos ruled the Indians in their care with little interference\r\nfrom alcaldes mayores, corregidores, or governors. Vander Linden\r\nespecially emphasizes the fact that the encomenderos were not supposed\r\nto act as the private masters of the Indians on their holdings,\r\nbut were to act as the representatives of the king (Vander Linden,\r\nL'expansion coloniale de l'Espagne, 345-346). The laws of the Indies\r\nspecified that the encomenderos were to protect, aid and educate\r\nthem, seeing particularly that they were taught the Catholic Faith\r\n(Recopilación, 6-8, 9, 10, 11; esp. tit. 9, laws 1-4).\r\n\r\nThe encomenderos, in the guise of benefactors, guardians and protectors\r\nof the Indians, supervised the labor of the latter on the encomiendas,\r\ndrawing remuneration therefrom, collecting tribute from them, and\r\nretaining a share of that. Aside from the very intimate relationship\r\nof the encomenderos as the guardians of the Indians in spiritual and\r\ntemporal things, they were not considered as officials in the same\r\nsense as were the alcaldes mayores and corregidores.\r\n\r\nDr. Pardo de Tavera characterizes the duties and relations of the\r\nencomenderos to the Indians as follows: \"The encomenderos were the\r\nfirst Spaniards after the conquest and pacification of the colony who\r\nrepresented the civil authority of Spain in the Islands: they were\r\nobliged to maintain order and secure the well-being of the Indian\r\nresidents of their encomiendas or holdings, and to defend their\r\ntenants against any encroachments on their rights by the Spaniards,\r\nsoldiers, alcaldes, and judges; and to endeavor to bring their tenants\r\ntogether in towns and furnish them with opportunities to be converted\r\nto the Christian religion, and to help them build churches and convents\r\n... encomenderos were charged with the succor and support of the people\r\non their holdings in case of any calamity, famine or public disaster,\r\nand they were prohibited from charging tribute in bulk against the\r\nvarious barangayes, that is to say, they should not make the chiefs of\r\na family or tribe responsible for the payment of tribute by the various\r\nmembers, nor were the encomenderos allowed to use force to secure the\r\npayment of a tribute. When an encomendero received a tribute from his\r\npeople, he thereupon was considered to have assumed the duty of acting\r\nas their protector\" (Pardo de Tavera, Philippines census [1905], I,\r\n330). Suffice it to say that, theoretically, the encomenderos were\r\nthe fatherly protectors and benefactors of the helpless, childlike\r\nnatives, and their every act was to be for the good of their wards.\r\n\r\n[49] Antequera, Historia de la legislation española, 486-487; Bourne,\r\n\"Historical introduction,\" in Blair and Robertson, I, 56.\r\n\r\n[50] Recopilación, 6-8-38 to 39; 8-9-20 to 24. It seems that the\r\noficiales reales merely supervised the collection of tribute, which\r\nwas really accomplished in the provinces by the alcaldes mayores\r\nand corregidores, who acted as their agents. Martinez de Zúñiga, An\r\nhistorical view of the Philippine Islands, I, 2; Ordinances of Good\r\nGovernment, Blair and Robertson, L, 191-264; Recopilación. 6-5-64;\r\nMontero y Vidal, Historia general, I, 380-385.\r\n\r\n[51] The Relación of Miguél de Loarca, alcalde mayor of Arévalo, Panay,\r\ngives us a good idea of the rapidity with which this institution spread\r\nwithin ten years in the Philippines. It indicates the extent to which\r\nthe encomienda was utilized as a means of opening up and settling the\r\ncountry. This report is dated June 12, 1582. At that time there were\r\nthree principal centers of administration in the Islands: Manila,\r\nCebú and Arévalo. About thirty encomiendas were located close to\r\nManila, ten were near to Cebú, and fifteen near to Arévalo under the\r\njurisdiction of Loarca. The latter group consisted of about 20,000\r\nIndians. Encomiendas varied in size from 250 to 1500 natives, but\r\nthe ideal encomienda was supposed to contain 500 souls. By cédula,\r\nof August 9, 1589, royal authority was extended for the increase of\r\nthe size of encomiendas in the Philippines to 800 or 1000 persons,\r\nif necessary, in order to bear the greater expenses of instruction and\r\ndefense. This was bitterly opposed by the churchmen on account of the\r\nadditional missionary labors incumbent on the priests assigned to these\r\nlarger encomiendas (Cédula of August 9, 1589, A. I., 105-2-11). Philip\r\nII, on November 30, 1568, had ordered that no encomienda should yield\r\nmore than 2000 pesos (Recopilación, 6-8-30).\r\n\r\nLoarca states that there were also encomiendas in the Camarines\r\nprovinces in southeast Luzon and in IIocos, in the north of the same\r\nisland. These encomiendas were under the jurisdiction of the alcaldes\r\nmayores and corregidores governing those provinces.

These\r\nare examples of the hundreds of complaints, mostly by churchmen,\r\nagainst the abuses of the encomenderos. It would be impossible to\r\ncite them all.\r\n\r\nThe Zulueta Papers are transcripts from the Archive of the Indies of\r\nSeville, the National Library of Madrid, and the British Museum. They\r\nwere copied under the direction of a Filipino scholar, Señor\r\nZulueta. These Papers are now in the Philippines Library at Manila.\r\n\r\n[54] On June 4, 1620, the governor of the Philippines was authorized\r\nto bestow encomiendas, with the provision that if he neglected\r\nto do so for a period of sixty days the vacant holdings should be\r\nbestowed by the audiencia. On October 24, 1655, Philip IV ordered\r\nthat acting viceroys and acting governors should be limited to the\r\nfaculty of providing encomiendas ad interim, subject to the subsequent\r\nratification of the Council of the Indies (Recopilación, 6-8-8, 1-4,\r\n5, 8, 11, 22).\r\n\r\n[55] Blair and Robertson, III, 304-306.\r\n\r\n[56] In this connection may be noted the distinction between\r\nthe two classes of encomiendas which was made for purposes of\r\nadministration. Private encomiendas were those which had been\r\ngranted to private persons, conquerors, discoverers, soldiers, or\r\npersons who paid a regular rent, usually a third of the gross tribute\r\ncollected. These were originally granted for life, and might be held\r\nfor two subsequent generations. Later (after 1655), the usual period\r\nof confirmation was ten years, for persons who rented encomiendas\r\nas a business proposition. The royal encomiendas were situated near\r\ncities or ports and the income from them was reserved for the expenses\r\nand necessities of the royal estate, the payment of salaries, and\r\nother governmental expenses. Private encomiendas became royal on the\r\ndeath of an incumbent if he had no heirs, or on the expiration of the\r\ncontract. The tribute from royal encomiendas was collected by the royal\r\ntreasury. Morga's Sucesos, Blair and Robertson, XVI, 157; also ibid.,\r\nVIII, 27; see Bourne, \"Historical introduction,\" ibid., I, 39-40.\r\n\r\nOn June 7, 1597, the king, as a suggestion for the increase of funds\r\nfor the maintenance of the government, wrote to the audiencia that a\r\ngreater number of royal encomiendas should be established, and that\r\nthe governor should not be permitted to assign so many to private\r\npersons (King to the Audiencia, June 7, 1597, A. I., 105-2-1). On\r\nFebruary 16, 1602, the king again addressed the audiencia on the\r\nsubject of the royal encomiendas, desiring to know why the tribute\r\nfrom them had so materially decreased, it having reached the low mark\r\nof 2500 pesos. In answer, the same reason for this falling off was\r\nsuggested as in the letter above quoted, namely, that the governor\r\nhad assigned many encomiendas to his friends (King to the Audiencia,\r\nFebruary 16, 1602, A. I., 105-2-1). Francisco de la Misa, factor of\r\nthe royal treasury of Manila, in a letter to the king, dated May 31,\r\n1595, stated that the royal encomiendas, which had been established to\r\nprovide revenue for the payment of the salaries of alcaldes mayores,\r\ntenientes, oficiales reales, and even that of the governor, had\r\ndiminished greatly in number, so that not enough revenue was derived\r\nfrom them to meet the expenses for which they had been created. Misa\r\nconcluded with a recommendation that eight royal encomiendas of the\r\nvalue of 8000 pesos a year should be established out of the first\r\nprivate encomiendas that were vacated (Misa to the King, May 31,\r\n1595, A. I. 67-6-29).\r\n\r\n[57] Salazar to the Council of the Indies, June 20, 1582, A. I.,\r\n68-1-32.\r\n\r\n[58] Ronquillo de Peñalosa to the King, July 15, 1582, A.

The associated merchants had one or more, the consulado,\r\neach religious order, etc. These procuradores were usually lawyers,\r\nnot infrequently men who had been in the islands. An interesting\r\nparallel might be noted between the procuradores and the American\r\ncolonial agents of prerevolutionary days. Zúñiga here gives Rivera\r\nentire credit for the bringing of the audiencia to Manila--op. cit.,\r\nI, 175. See note 16, supra.\r\n\r\n[66] The alcabala (al que vale, \"according to value\") was a\r\npercentage tax levied on goods (movable and immovable) sold or\r\nexchanged. Merchants were held accountable for the payment of this tax,\r\nand for this purpose their accounts were examined by royal officials\r\nat regular intervals (Escriche, Diccionario, I, 143). It was first\r\nintroduced into the Indies by Philip II in 1574, having been levied in\r\nSpain as early as 1079, though not in its perfected form. In accordance\r\nwith the tariff of November 1, 1591, it was exacted from merchants,\r\napothecaries, encomenderos (having farms and cattle-ranches),\r\nragpickers, cloth-makers, silversmiths, goldsmiths, blacksmiths,\r\nand shoemakers. An alcabala was paid on wine. By the cédula of June\r\n7, 1576, the rate of alcabala was fixed at two per cent. In Perú it\r\nwas raised to four per cent during the administration of the Conde\r\nde Chinchón as viceroy and was collected at that rate there until the\r\ncédula of July 26, 1776, raised it to six per cent. This rate was paid\r\nthereafter in the Spanish colonies (Recopilación, 8-13-1 to 14, notes,\r\n2 and 4), except for an increase in the rate to 8 per cent in 1782, to\r\nmeet the added expenses of war. The old rate of 6 per cent was restored\r\nin 1791 (transcripts of these cédulas exist in A. I., 87-1-20).\r\n\r\nExemptions from this tax were made in favor of churches, monasteries,\r\nand prelates when they bought or sold goods not for profit. When they\r\nengaged in commerce for its own sake they were obliged to pay the\r\nalcabala in the same way as laymen (Recopilación, 8-13-17). Goods\r\nbelonging to the Santa Cruzada, provisions bought, sold or stored\r\nwhich were destined for the poor, and munitions of war paid no alcabala\r\n(ibid., 18-23). Indians were also exempted under certain circumstances\r\n(ibid., 24; see entire Title 13 of Book 8, Recopilación, for further\r\nspecifications regarding the payment of this tax). In 1568 Philip\r\nII exempted the Philippines for thirty years. As noted above, the\r\nalcabala was not introduced regularly into the Indies until 1574,\r\nthough it was levied in individual cases as early as 1558. Even\r\nearlier than this Pizarro had obtained the right to levy it in Perú\r\nfor a period of a hundred years (ibid., 8-13-1; note 1), but Philip II\r\nordered it paid in the Philippines on August 9, 1589 (ibid., 9-45-66).\r\n\r\nThe almojarifazgo, like the alcabala, had been utilized early in the\r\nhistory of the Peninsula and because a productive source of revenue,\r\nit was introduced into the Indies. The earliest law dealing with\r\nthis tax in New Spain was promulgated by Charles V on October 18,\r\n1553, exempting cargoes which had already paid the tax in Spain. On\r\nJune 24, 1566, and on December 28, 1568, Philip II ordered a five\r\nper cent export tax on all goods leaving Seville for the Indies\r\n(the ordinance of December 28, 1562, having fixed it at two and a\r\nhalf per cent) and an import tax in the Indies on these same goods\r\nof ten per cent, making in all a tax of fifteen per cent. Wine was\r\nto pay a ten per cent import and export tax respectively, making a\r\ntotal of twenty per cent paid on that commodity (ibid., 8-15-1, 2,\r\n8). The law of April 21, 1574, ordered a two and a half export and\r\na five per cent import tax on goods shipped between colonies (ibid.,\r\n10). On August 9, 1589, a three per cent almojarifazgo was authorized\r\nin the Philippines, with exemptions on provisions, munitions, and\r\nother specified articles brought to the Islands by the Chinese,\r\nJapanese, Siamese, and Borneans (ibid., 22, 24). The tax on Chinese\r\nmerchandise was raised from three to six per cent on November 20,\r\n1606 (ibid., 23). Chinese goods from the Philippines paid a ten per\r\ncent almojarifazgo at Acapulco. This tax was also paid on leaving\r\nthe Philippines or other New Spain ports and on entrance at Acapulco\r\n(ibid., 21). For exemptions see Recopilación, 8-15-26 to 30.\r\n\r\n[67] Rivera to the King, February 16, 1582, A. I., 1-1-2/24.\r\n\r\n[68] A legal defender of the Indians was wanted in this case to serve\r\nthem in the courts. The bishop, at this time, was protector of the\r\nIndians and in that capacity had protested against the abuses of the\r\nencomenderos. The bishop, of course, could not enter the courts and\r\ndefend the Indians in litigation.\r\n\r\nThe law of March 17, 1593, which ultimately established a defender\r\nof the Indians in Manila, filled the need voiced by Rivera. The\r\nlaw referred to read as follows: \"The protection and defense of the\r\nIndians in the Philippines was entrusted by us to the bishops there,\r\nbut having recognized that the latter cannot conform to the demands,\r\nautos and judicial summons which require their personal presence,\r\nwe order that our president-governor shall name a protector and\r\ndefender of the Indians, assigning to him a sufficient salary from\r\nthe taxes levied pro rata upon the Indians who are under the royal\r\njurisdiction and on private encomiendas, without touching the revenues\r\nof our royal hacienda which are for other purposes. And we declare that\r\nthis does not signify that it is our intention to deprive the bishops\r\nof the superintendence and protection of the Indians in general\"\r\n(Recopilación, 6-6-8).\r\n\r\nPhilip II, on January 10, 1589, restored the office of protector or\r\ndefender of the Indians in the Indies generally. It was stated in\r\nthis law that as a result of the earlier abolition of the office\r\nmany inconveniences and injustices had arisen. The law authorized\r\nthe appointment of a person of good character and morals to the\r\noffice (ibid., 1). The reform of April 9, 1591, required that the\r\nappointee should be a lawyer, and that there should be a defender of\r\nthe Indians attached to each audiencia (ibid., 3). The reform of March\r\n11, 1784, provided that the fiscales should name these protectors in\r\nthe future. (Ibid., note 1.)\r\n\r\n[69] The Audiencia of Guadalajara was at that time subordinate to\r\nthe Viceroy of New Spain in matters of war, government, and finance\r\n(hacienda).

A second cédula permitting the Spaniards in\r\nthe Philippines to do this was promulgated by Philip III on May 29,\r\n1620. This act was rendered justifiable in the eyes of the Spaniards\r\nby the fact that they were dealing with semi-savages who were of\r\nthe Mohammedan faith, and accordingly the ceaseless enemies of the\r\nSpaniards.

I.,\r\n67-6-18.\r\n\r\n[78] The Recopilación is singularly indefinite regarding the rate or\r\namount of tribute to be assessed in New Spain. Beyond the stipulation\r\nthat tribute levied under the supervision of viceroys, presidents,\r\nand audiencias should be moderate and just, practically nothing is\r\nsaid as to the amount that should be collected (See cédulas of June 19,\r\n1536, and September 29, 1555, Recopilación, 6-5-21), excepting certain\r\nincreases as stipulated in the law of November 1, 1591 (ley 16).\r\n\r\nAccording to the laws just cited, the rate was to be fixed by the\r\nofficials mentioned above. By cédula of December 19, 1534, the\r\noficiales reales were empowered to fix the rate of tribute (ibid.,\r\n28). Reductions in the rate of tribute were to be authorized by\r\nthe fiscal and oficiales reales (ibid., 29). Apparently the rate\r\nvaried according to the locality (ibid., 1 to 5, 16, 17), and in the\r\ncédulas of 1536 and 1555, cited above, consideration was given to\r\nthe rate formerly paid by the Indians to their caciques. Fonseca y\r\nUrrutia (Historia de la real hacienda, I, 417 et seq.) tell us that\r\nthe tribute paid in the province of Tlascala in 1572 was 13 reales;\r\nin 1564 the rate for New Spain was fixed at two pesos, and in 1600 it\r\nwas reduced to one peso of eight reales. (Bancroft, History of Mexico,\r\nII, 586-9.) Humboldt (Political Essay, II, 431-2) states that there\r\nhad been a gradual diminution of tribute paid by the Indians during\r\nthe hundred years preceding his visit. In 1601, he states, Indians\r\npaid 32 reales tribute and 4 reales additional, de servicio, in all,\r\nabout 23 francs. It had been reduced, little by little, till the\r\namount actually paid was from 5 to 15 francs, and, \"in the greater\r\npart of Mexico,\" he states, \"the head-tax amounts to 11 francs.\"\r\n\r\nArchbishop Benavides, of Manila, writing in 1600 (Zulueta Papers,\r\ndate and place number not given) pleaded for the abolition of the\r\ntribute in the Philippines, stating that while the collection of\r\ntribute in New Spain was justifiable because the natives had been\r\naccustomed to paying tribute before the Spaniards came, the custom was\r\nentirely new in the Philippines, since the native princes had never\r\nlevied tribute. On the other hand, various persons writing from the\r\nPhilippines at different times urged that the tribute there should\r\nbe increased to the rate imposed in New Spain.\r\n\r\nThe money value of the tribute in the Philippines was fixed at eight\r\nreales by Legaspi. It could be paid either in gold or in kind. De\r\nMorga tells us that the encomenderos made great profit by receiving\r\nthe payment in rice, cotton, cloth, fowls, and other commodities, at\r\na cheap rate, selling those same articles later to the improvident\r\nnatives at greatly increased prices (Morga's Sucesos, Blair and\r\nRobertson, XVI, 159). When Dasmariñas arrived as governor in 1590,\r\nthe tribute was raised from eight to ten reales (cédula of August 9,\r\n1589, Recopilación, 6-5-65, also A. I., 105-2-11). While the eight\r\nreales were to be appropriated by the encomenderos, the additional\r\ntwo reales were to be distributed between the religious and military\r\ngovernments in proportions of one-half to one and a half (Blair and\r\nRobertson, XVI, 160).\r\n\r\nIn the instructions of May 23, 1593, to Governor Dasmariñas, reference\r\nwas made to a current rate of eight reales (ibid., IX, 249), so it\r\nwould seem that the local rate had been reduced from ten to eight\r\nreales at some date between 1589 and 1593. On February 16, 1602,\r\nthe rate was restored at ten reales (Recopilación, 6-5-65), and was\r\nso continued until a subsequent regulation made optional on the part\r\nof the natives the payment of the ten reales or four reales and a\r\nfowl. On August 19, 1623, Fray Juan de Balmaseda complained that the\r\nencomenderos were making the natives pay ten reales in addition to\r\nthe fowl and that the above law was thus resulting in the payment of\r\nsixteen reales tribute (A. I., 68-1-63). Accordingly, on November 21,\r\n1625, a cédula was issued which eliminated the substitution of the\r\nfowl, and the rate was restored at ten reales, payable in gold or\r\nsilver (A. I., 105-2-1). The king, in response to complaints against\r\nthe collection of tributes in the provinces of Camarines and Albay,\r\nissued a cédula on September 25, 1697, ordering the observance in\r\nthe Philippines of Book 6, Title 5, of the Recopilación de Indias,\r\nwhich meant the correction of the abuse above referred to (A. I.,\r\n68-4-12). It would seem that the rate of ten reales was levied\r\nthroughout the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[79] Audiencia to the Council of the Indies, June 26, 1586, A.

This\r\nregulation was first enacted January 11, 1593 (Recopilación 9-45-6,\r\n9). On the same date residents of New Spain were forbidden to trade\r\nin the Philippines and the entire Philippine and Chinese trade was\r\nexpressly reserved to subjects in the Philippines. The latter were\r\ngiven the exclusive privilege of sending goods to New Spain (ibid.,\r\n1). They were permitted to buy only from the Chinese merchants who came\r\nto Manila (ibid., 34).--See Martinez de Zúñiga, Estadismo, I, 266-270.\r\n\r\n[105] Cédula of January 11, 1593, Recopilación, 9-45-44.\r\n\r\n[106] Morga to Philip II, July 6, 1596, Blair and Robertson, IX, 271.\r\n\r\n[107] Ordinance for the re-establishment of the Audiencia of Manila,\r\nNovember 26, 1595, A.

It is certain, too, that the audiencia\r\nwas also destined to champion the royal prerogative in the face of\r\nthe encroachments of the higher officials of the church. This need\r\nwas especially urged by Morga.\r\n\r\n    Grao y Monfalcón, the procurator of the merchants of Manila at the\r\n    court in 1636, wrote on June 13 of that year: \"In the year 590 the\r\n    royal Audiencia of Manila was suppressed ... and its suppression\r\n    must also be reckoned among the hardships of that city ... because\r\n    of those which it suffered until the year 597, when the Audiencia\r\n    was reëstablished (sic).\" (Blair and Robertson, XXVII, 189).\r\n\r\n[109] Pancada, the wholesale purchase of the goods brought to Manila\r\nby the Chinese. These goods were bought by a committee of two or\r\nthree persons, acting for the governor and ayuntamiento, then sold\r\nor apportioned among the merchants of the city in proportion to the\r\namount of money which they were able to invest. This arrangement\r\nwas designed to give all the merchants a chance to buy and at the\r\nsame time to prevent the Chinese from selling at exorbitant prices\r\n(Cédula of January 11, 1593, Recopilación, 9-45-34.)\r\n\r\n[110] Cédulas of May 5, 1583, and May 25, 1596, Recopilación,\r\n2-15-11.

Helps (Spanish conquest, I, 102, 103-104)\r\nstates that the repartimiento system was originated in 1496, from\r\nthe requirement of Columbus that the natives of Hispaniola should pay\r\nhim a certain quantity of gold as tribute. In view of the inability\r\nof the natives to meet the demands of the Spaniards in regard to\r\nthe precious metal, \"the villagers were ordered to make (and work)\r\nthe farms in the Spanish settlements. This may be considered as the\r\nbeginning of the system of repartimientos, or encomiendas, as they\r\nwere afterwards called.\"\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent chapter the same author tells of the difficulty which\r\nOvando had in compelling the Indians to live among the Spaniards, to\r\npay tribute and accept religious teaching. Ferdinand and Isabella,\r\nin a letter dated December 20, 1503, directed Ovando to compel the\r\nIndians to deal with the Spaniards, to work for wages, to go to mass,\r\nto be instructed in the faith, and further, that they should do all\r\nthese things \"as free persons, for so they are.\" ... \"Ovando adopted\r\nthe following system,\" says Helps; \"he distributed Indians amongst\r\nthe Castillians, giving to one man fifty, to another a hundred; with\r\na deed that ran thus: 'to you, such a one, is given an encomienda\r\nof so many Indians, with such a Cacique, and you are to teach them\r\nthe things of our Holy Catholic Faith'. The word encomienda ... was a\r\nterm belonging to the military orders, corresponding to our commandery\r\nor preceptory; and this term naturally enough came into use with the\r\nappointment, as governors in the Indies, of men, who held authority\r\nin those orders, such as Bobadilla and Ovando.\" (See also Bancroft,\r\nHistory of Central America, I, 262.) \"With respect to the implied\r\ncondition of teaching the Indians 'the Holy Catholic Faith' it was\r\nno more attended to from the first than any formal clause in a deed,\r\nwhich is supposed by the parties concerned to be a mere formality.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have now arrived,\" continues Helps, \"at the climax of the\r\nrepartimiento system. That which Bobadilla did illegally, was now done\r\nwith proper formalities on parchment: ... We may notice again that the\r\nfirst repartimientos made by Columbus ... apportioned to any Spaniard,\r\nwhom he thought fit, such and such lands, to be worked by such a\r\nCacique and his people--a very different procedure to giving men--a\r\nfeudal system, not a system of slavery.\"--Helps, Spanish conquest,\r\nI, 138-139.\r\n\r\n[152] Recopilación, 2-15-129.\r\n\r\n[153] Ibid., 127.\r\n\r\n[154] Ibid., 5-15-181.\r\n\r\n[155] Francisco de la Misa to the King, May 31, 1595, A.

According to law 181 (1589), the authority of the governor (the\r\naudiencia had been suppressed) was extended to cases of the same value.\r\n\r\n[157] It is probable that Misa meant that there was not sufficient\r\ndistinction between the governor's asesor and the teniente de\r\ngobierno.

We have record of the extension of an\r\nencomienda in the Philippines to the Hospital of San Juan de Diós for\r\nfour years by Governor Marquina on July 10, 1789. The cofradía had\r\nheld this encomienda for ten years, and on its petition the governor\r\nmade this additional concession, subject to royal confirmation (A. I.,\r\n107-5-18). The above episode is at variance with the statement of\r\nBancroft (History of Central America, I, 264) that the encomienda\r\nsystem came to an end in 1721.

At the end of this period there were\r\n122 cases waiting on the docket. In the chamber of first instance\r\nof the same audiencia 72 cases were tried and 124 remained to be\r\ntried at the end of approximately the same period. In the criminal\r\nsala during the year 1788, there were 7 death sentences rendered,\r\n16 sentences for robbery, 14 cases tried involving personal injury,\r\n15 for carrying arms in face of the prohibition of the law, and 6\r\ncases of adultery. The magistrates excused themselves for this rather\r\ncontemptible showing by alleging that the membership of the tribunal\r\nhad not been complete, to which the king made answer that there would\r\nhave been sufficient judges had not the latter continually absented\r\nthemselves on the smallest pretexts.

Special emphasis\r\nshould be placed upon the last clause of the above definition. The\r\nperiodical residencia was not the sole means for the removal of\r\nofficials in the Spanish colonies. The conclusion seems to have been\r\nreached by many historians that officials were permitted to conduct\r\nthemselves carelessly, running their offices to suit their own personal\r\nconvenience from the date of their appointment, in the assurance that\r\ntheir tenure was sure until the termination of a specified term,\r\nand that the periodical residencia was the only occasion on which\r\nthey might be held to answer for their sins.

Up to the present,\r\nLatin American scholarship has been content with a rehashing of Helps\r\nand Prescott, for the early periods, omitting the seventeenth century\r\nand the greater part of the eighteenth altogether, and fixing on\r\nJuan y Ulloa, Robertson, and Humboldt as the great all-determining\r\nauthorities for the latter periods of Spanish colonization. These,\r\nindeed, have been supplemented by a few ecclesiastical histories, each\r\nof which has been written to prove a particular thesis. The present\r\nwriter dares to believe, after some attempt to harmonize the laws\r\nof the Indies with actual practice, that these laws were actually\r\nused as a basis of colonial government, and that, while not always\r\neffectively enforced, they were by no means a dead-letter until Spain\r\nactually lost her colonies and are not today, for it is easy to see\r\nin the laws of the Indies the fundamentals of the institutions of\r\npresent-day Spanish America.\r\n\r\n[232] Recopilación, 5-15-1.\r\n\r\n[233] Cédula of August 24, 1799, in Rodríguez San Pedro, Legislación\r\nultramarina, III, 280-281.\r\n\r\n[234] Papeles relativos á la residencia del gobernador\r\nSalcedo.

I.,\r\n107-5-20). These annual deductions of one-fifth were first authorized\r\non August 26, 1757, on the recommendation of the Council of the\r\nIndies. They were discontinued by the consulta of March 2, 1773,\r\nit being ordered that governors should only post the customary bonds\r\nwith the president of the Council of the Indies. We see here that the\r\npractice was restored on December 30, 1776. This requirement seems to\r\nhave been confined to governors of the Philippines (A. I., 105-2-21).\r\n\r\n[248] Recopilación, 8-19; see notes 11 and 13, Chapter V of this book.\r\n\r\n[249] Recopilación, 8-26-17.\r\n\r\n[250] Ibid., 5-15-42.\r\n\r\n[251] Ibid., note 12.\r\n\r\n[252] Royal decree of November 20, 1841, in Rodríguez San Pedro,\r\nLegislación ultramarina, I, 282; see also royal order of December 3,\r\n1844 (for Cuba), ibid., 287.\r\n\r\n[253] Officials, desirous of ingratiating themselves into the favor\r\nof the new executive, frequently journeyed by land and sea from Manila\r\nas far as the Straits of San Bernardino. The privilege thus gained of\r\nreturning to Manila in company with the new governor, gave them the\r\nunrestricted or unqualified opportunity to poison his mind with tales\r\nof the misdeeds of the incumbent, and insinuations as to the wealth\r\nwhich the latter had heaped up for himself through the exercise of\r\ndishonest methods.\r\n\r\n[254] The residencia of a governor presented a splendid opportunity\r\nto his enemies for revenge. A governor was always in a fair way to\r\nmake enemies; consequently any such awaited the residencia of their\r\nformer oppressor with great eagerness. In case a governor did make\r\nfair profit out of his office, and there were many opportunities for\r\nprofit, commercial and otherwise, legitimate and illegitimate, his\r\nenemies gave him no rest at the time of his residencia. (According to\r\nMartínez de Zúñiga [Estadismo. I, 242] the emoluments of the governor,\r\naside from his salary, aggregated 20,000 pesos a year.) It is probable\r\nthat most of the governors were dishonest, as the opportunities for\r\ncorruption were numerous, and the temptations offered by the position\r\nwere too powerful to be resisted by any human being. Thousands of\r\nmiles from Spain, in an age of slow communication, entrusted with\r\nthe assignment of all sorts of lucrative offices, encomiendas, and\r\ncommercial privileges, and having friends, relatives, and special\r\ninterests to serve, a governor was surrounded by countless officials\r\nwho were eagerly awaiting their share of booty, and who were ready\r\nat a moment's notice to turn traitor if they could gain by such an\r\nact. It may be said of the Spanish colonial governor as was said of\r\nVerres of old, that in stealing, one must steal threefold, once for\r\nhimself, once for his judges, and once to pay the penalty.\r\n\r\n[255] Chapter II of this book.\r\n\r\n[256] Montero y Vidal, Historia general, II, 253-258. Anda, as it will\r\nbe noted later, spent an earlier term of service in the Philippines. He\r\nfirst came to the Philippines during the administration of Governor\r\nArandía, as oidor of the audiencia. He had therefore been obliged\r\nto submit to residencia on a previous occasion; in 1764 a review was\r\nmade of his official conduct as oidor, and especially of his acts in\r\ndefiance of Archbishop Rojo, in setting up claims to the governorship\r\nof the Islands and resisting the British. His conduct was approved,\r\nand he received high honor and promotion at the court, being advanced\r\nto membership in the Council of Castile. On November 19, 1769, he was\r\ngranted an annual pension of 3000 pesos for life. On September 8, 1777,\r\nthis pension was continued in favor of his eldest son (A. I., 106-4-4).\r\n\r\n[257] Anda had more than the usual number of residencias to supervise\r\nat the beginning of his term. Owing to some misapprehension on the\r\npart of his predecessor, Governor Raón, no residencia was required\r\nof La Torre, the teniente del rey who took over the government in\r\n1764. Owing to the anarchical condition in Manila consequent upon the\r\ninvasion of the British, and the ecclesiastical rule preceding that\r\nevent, neither Arandía, Espeleta, nor Rojo had given residencia. The\r\naudiencia and Raón in acuerdo on October 26, 1768, voted that\r\ngovernors' residencias should be dispensed with, and apparently\r\nbelieved that this action settled the matter. On November 9, 1770,\r\nthe Council of the Indies disapproved of this stand, fined Raón (who\r\nhad died the preceding July), and ordered Anda to take the residencias\r\nof Arandía (governor, 1754-1759), Espeleta (archbishop-governor,\r\n1759-1761), Rojo (archbishop-governor, 1761-1764), Oidor Villacorta,\r\nand Governor Raón. These orders he complied with, conducting the\r\ninvestigations with his characteristic thoroughness, though Rojo\r\nand Raón were dead. Villacorta was imprisoned and heavily fined. The\r\nsentences against Arandía, Raón and Villacorta were moderated by the\r\nCouncil of the Indies on September 9, 1772.--A. I., 105-2-31.\r\n\r\n[258] As we shall note in another chapter, José Basco y Vargas\r\ninaugurated the reforms of the intendancy in the Philippines,\r\nretaining the post of governor, while Ciriaco Gonzales Carvajal\r\nwas first intendente de guerra y real hacienda.--A. I., 105-3-5 and\r\n107-5-19; see Chapter V, note 20, of this work.\r\n\r\n[259] This residencia was held under the same laws that had prevailed\r\nthroughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. A feature common\r\nto them all, particularly, was the fact that the regent, or some other\r\ncolonial magistrate conducted the investigation and gave sentence,\r\nwhich might be appealed to the Council of the Indies. This gave an\r\nopportunity for great injustice to be done to the governor by his\r\nenemies, and it did not give him an impartial hearing. The laws of\r\n1799 still permitted a local magistrate to collect the evidence,\r\nbut the decision was rendered by the Council of the Indies.\r\n\r\n[260] Audiencia to the King, June 28, 1791, A. I., 108-4-18.\r\n\r\n[261] Instructions to Amparán, February 19, 1792, A. I., 105-2-10.\r\n\r\n[262] Instructions were also given at the same time for investigations\r\nof the official conduct of numerous persons who had been identified\r\nwith the government of Marquina. Among these were Helarión\r\nPastor, fiscal de la real hacienda. Manuel de Sota, contador de\r\ncuentas. Francisco Múñoz, teniente del rey. Rufino Suárez Rivera,\r\nasesor, and Miguel Formento, clerk of the treasury. A separate\r\ncommission was made for the residencia of each of these.\r\n\r\n[263] The just and honorable conduct of Marquina's successor on this\r\noccasion may be contrasted with that of his various predecessors,\r\nwhose unfairness, bigotry, and stupidity had caused governors\r\nCorcuera, Silva, and Torralba, victims of residencia, to be seized,\r\nimprisoned, and exiled without opportunities for defense, while\r\ntheir investigations were being conducted. This case serves well to\r\nillustrate the fact that by the close of the eighteenth century the\r\nresidencia had grown more humane.\r\n\r\n[264] He was charged with having entered into a conspiracy with an\r\nArmenian merchant to secure trade which should have gone to Spanish\r\nmerchants. In this particular venture he had made a profit of 16,000\r\npesos and in so doing he had not only violated the laws of the Indies\r\nwhich forbade officials to trade (Recopilación, 2-16-54, 62), but he\r\nhad connived at the infraction of another law which forbade trade to\r\nforeigners (ibid., 9-27-1, 5, 7 and note 2).\r\n\r\n[265] It is an interesting commentary on Spanish methods that,\r\nnotwithstanding Marquina's misgovernment in the Philippines, he was\r\npromoted to the post of viceroy of New Spain, which position he held\r\nfrom 1800 to 1803.\r\n\r\nDesdevises du Dezert, in his article on \"Vice-rois et capitaines\r\ngénéraux des Indes espagnoles\" (Revue historique, CXXV, 241), shows\r\nthat Marquina continued his peculations while viceroy of New Spain,\r\nengaging in the smuggling trade with Jamaica, and enriching himself\r\nto the extent that in thirty-two months he was able to send twelve\r\nmillion pesos on his own account to Spain. Desdevises du Dezert\r\ninadvertently refers to Marquina as having come from the Marianas to\r\nMexico. He came from the Philippines and not from the Marianas.\r\n\r\n[266] Recopilación, 5-15, notes 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n[267] Reales resoluciones del Consejo, 4 de Marzo, 1794, A.

The\r\npapers relating to this trial easily aggregate 4000 pages.\r\n\r\n[284] It was said that he had shown favoritism in his dealings with\r\nsome of the barangay (district) chiefs, allowing them unbridled\r\nlicense in the collection of tribute and in the enforcement of\r\ncompulsory labor, most of which they utilized for their own, or for\r\nhis, benefit. One chief was said to have gone so far as to forcibly\r\ntake carabaos from the natives when the latter were working them\r\nin the fields. Zéndera had, of course, extended favors to these\r\nbarangay chiefs in exchange for reciprocal advantages. (The alcaldes\r\nmayores ruled the native population through these chiefs at this\r\ntime. Later they utilized the gobernadorcillos, who were native or\r\nmestizo governors of the small towns.--See Malcolm, The government\r\nof the Philippine Islands, 64-72.)\r\n\r\nIt was also charged that he had allowed cock-fights whenever\r\nrequested, instead of restricting these to holidays and Sundays\r\nas the law prescribed. On these occasions he collected two reales\r\nfrom each entrant, and in addition he took the slain birds, alleging\r\nthat they were for the consumption of the inmates of the provincial\r\nprison. Testimony was produced to show that the prisoners had never\r\neaten fowl.\r\n\r\n[285] In taking the residencias of corregidores and alcaldes mayores\r\nthe audiencia frequently took great responsibility upon itself. On\r\nJuly 10, 1800, on taking the residencia of Luís Rodríguez Varela,\r\nalcalde mayor of Pangasinán, the audiencia suspended the decoration\r\nof the pequeña cruz, which had been conferred upon this official by\r\nthe royal authority. The deprivation, in this case, was tentative,\r\npending the investigation of the charges which had been made of\r\nshortages in the finances of his province.--Audiencia to the King,\r\nJuly 10, 1800, A. I., 106-4-18.\r\n\r\n[286] The original sentence probably denied to Zéndera the privilege\r\nof holding the office of alcalde mayor only, since he occupied the\r\npost of regidor of the city of Manila, pending the appeal of his\r\ncase to the Council of the Indies. It is evident, therefore, that\r\nthe sentence which was pronounced upon Zéndera did not apply to all\r\npositions of honor and trust.\r\n\r\n[287] Cédula of August 24, 1799, Recopilación, 5-15, notes 4 and 5;\r\nsee also Rodríguez San Pedro, Legislación ultramarina, I, 282.\r\n\r\n[288] Escriche, Diccionario. I, 578; see also royal order of November\r\n20, 1841, and of January 18, 1848, in Rodríguez San Pedro, Legislación\r\nultramarina, I, 282; 290. When the Intendancy was established in\r\n1784-7, an effort was made by the newly created officials to escape\r\nthe residencia. The entire term of the first intendant, Carvajal (or\r\nCarbajal), had been devoted to an assertion of his independence of\r\nthe governor and audiencia. Carvajal interpreted the law requiring all\r\nofficials of the government to give residencia every five years to the\r\nDepartment of Justice as not applying to him or his subordinates. He\r\npointed to the stipulation in the ordinance which created his\r\ndepartment, and established its independence of the executive and\r\njudiciary. The king disapproved of his attitude and ordered that\r\nhenceforth the officials of real hacienda should give residencia\r\nin the same manner as other officials, in accordance with the laws\r\nof the Indies. (King to Carvajal. July 29, 1788, A. I., 107-5-19,\r\nciting Recopilación, 2-15-69; 5-15-15 and Ordenanza de Intendentes\r\nde Buenos Ayres, Art. 305.) This decree ordered that the residencias\r\nof the intendants and their assistants should be submitted to the\r\naudiencia. The cédula of August 24, 1799, so frequently cited in this\r\nchapter, gave final jurisdiction to the audiencia over the residencias\r\nof intendentes-corregidores, but it decreed that superintendents\r\nshould give residencia directly to the Council of the Indies.\r\n\r\n[289] Martínez Alcubilla (Diccionario, XI, 477) and Escriche\r\n(Diccionario, II, 819) state that the cédula of August 24, 1799,\r\nabolished the residencia. The latter states that the residencia\r\nwas eliminated because of the corruption of judges, and as the\r\njudges of residencia had proved to be a grave infliction on the\r\ntowns, mistreating witnesses and defendants on many occasions,\r\nit was thought advisable to discontinue the practice of holding\r\nthese investigations. Escriche also quotes extracts from the laws\r\nof August 24, 1799, September 26, 1835, and November 20, 1841,\r\nwherein were provided regulations for the future continuance of the\r\nresidencia. Cases involving viceroys, captains-general, and presidents\r\nof audiencias were to be tried in the Supreme Tribunal of Justice in\r\nfirst instance. Alcaldes mayores, corregidores, military and political\r\ngovernors who were not presidents were to be tried in the audiencias\r\nwhich exercised jurisdiction over their districts.\r\n\r\n[290] See Cédula of July 7, 1860, in Rodríguez San Pedro, Legislación\r\nultramarina, III, 287; royal order of July 25, 1865, ibid., X, 99;\r\nroyal order of October 25, 1870, Colección legislativa, CV, 442-465.\r\n\r\nThe eminent authority, Manuel Bernáldez Pizarro, writing from Manila\r\non April 26, 1827, deplored the laxity which was characteristic\r\nof the method of conducting trials of residencia, and recommended\r\nthat they be made more effective and just. He criticized especially\r\nthe prevailing system of holding the alcaldes mayores to a strict\r\naccountability; who, he wrote, \"as they have permission to trade,\r\nare more tempted to evade or infringe the laws; and many persons are\r\nappointed to that office 'who lack all the qualifications necessary\r\nfor any public office whatever,' ... not only have they used their\r\nauthority to possess themselves of the property of the Indians\r\n... and defrauded the Indians with unjust exactions; but they have\r\nhumiliated the religious, stolen moneys from the king ... [and]\r\nhave thrown the provinces into a condition of effervescence and of\r\nconspiracy against the government.\" (Blair and Robertson, LI, 212,\r\n212-213.) Pizarro recommended a more stringent residencia as a means\r\nof remedying these defects.\r\n\r\n[291] Recopilación, 5-15-17 and 18; 9-45-42.\r\n\r\n[292] Governor to Council of the Indies, January 4, 1710, A.

This tax was first authorized on February 5, 1504\r\n(Recopilación, 8-10-1). Philip II conceded a commutation of this tax to\r\nten per cent in favor of adelantados, their successors and other early\r\nsettlers (ibid., 4-3-19). A draft of a letter exists in A. I., 106-6-6,\r\nwritten about 1585 by Governor Sande of the Philippines, asking for\r\nan extension of this dispensation.--See Blair and Robertson, IV, 87,\r\npar. 114 and note. On August 8, 1609, the king inquired of the Manila\r\naudiencia whether the tax was a fifth or a tenth.--A.

This junta is to be distinguished from the real\r\ncontaduría, which was composed of the oficiales reales. See Martínez\r\nde Zúñiga, Estadismo, 246.\r\n\r\n[300] This was the junta superior de la real hacienda, created\r\nfor Manila by the law of July 24, 1784. It was one of the reforms\r\nof the intendancy. It cannot be said, however, that these reforms\r\nbecame effective until 1787, though the cédulas of July 17 and 24,\r\n1784, which ordered them, were received in Manila on December 5,\r\n1785. These cédulas ordered the formation of a government locally,\r\nwhich would conform to the general principles of the intendancy and\r\nwhich were laid down in the cédulas referred to. These plans had\r\nto be referred to Spain on appeal. Subsequently the Ordinance of\r\nIntendants of Buenos Ayres was applied to the Philippines.--A. I.,\r\n107-5-14. Until January 11, 1791, all appeals from the junta superior\r\nwere heard in the Audiencia of Manila. The cédula of that date,\r\nreceived in Manila on June 30, 1793, ordered that such appeals should\r\nbe carried to the Council of the Indies.--A. I., 107-5-22. The junta\r\nsuperior de real hacienda did much toward relieving the audiencia of\r\nits advisory functions as in matters of finance and commerce. Many\r\nevidences of this may be noted in the reports and correspondence of the\r\nsuperintendente de real hacienda de Manila.--A. I., 107-5-14; 107-5-15\r\nto 31; 107-6-1 to 31; 107-7-1 to 21. Priestley (José de Gálvez,\r\n338-9) shows that even after the establishment of the intendancy in\r\nNew Spain, the audiencia retained the administration of crown lands,\r\nnotwithstanding the provisions of the new laws which ordered that\r\nthey should be controlled by the junta superior.

Holders of\r\necclesiastical benefices were subsequently obliged to pay the media\r\nanata, although they were especially exempted by the cédula of\r\nJune 2, 1632. The media anata (civil and ecclesiastical) was paid\r\nuntil December 28, 1846, when this tax, together with the lanza (a\r\ntax formerly paid by the nobility, but subsequently required of all\r\nclasses in lieu of military service) was abolished (Martínez Alcubilla,\r\nDiccionario, I, 407).\r\n\r\n[305] Ibid., 8-19-1 and 2.\r\n\r\n[306] The cédula of July 3, 1664, reorganized the system of medias\r\nanatas, authorizing their division into two separate allotments,\r\none payable at the court on the appointment of the official\r\nconcerned, and the second within or at the end of eighteen months\r\nafter his appointment, at the capital of the district wherein he\r\nserved. Guarantees had to be given that the second payment would be\r\nmade when due, and interest was charged at the rate of eight per cent\r\na year on the amount remaining to be paid (ibid., 4).\r\n\r\n[307] Cédula of December 14, 1776, A.

In\r\n1786 the profit from the sale of betel was 16,770 pesos (Report of\r\nIntendant, January 8, 1788, A.

The cédula of July 16, 1776, ordered the\r\nconfiscation of property left by foreigners, forbidding that it\r\nshould be sent outside of the realm either by the juez de difuntos\r\nor by the testamentary executor. In accordance with this regulation\r\nthe superintendent, in 1800, seized the property of a Spaniard who\r\nhad married a lady of Madras. The Spaniard had left a will providing\r\nfor the transfer of his property to his wife, naming an executor\r\nto administer the will. This was opposed by the juez de difuntos,\r\nbut when the case was appealed the action of the superintendent was\r\napproved (Aguilar to Soler, July 8, 1800, A. I., 107-5-24).\r\n\r\n[325] See Recopilación, 2-32-42.\r\n\r\n[326] A case appealed to the Council of the Indies on June 4,\r\n1806, involved the property of Antonio Rodríguez de la Peña,\r\ndeceased.

This report was submitted to cover the\r\nadministration of the property of Alberto Reyes, who died in Manila\r\nin 1803. The statement was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Total property left                            123,700 r.\r\n    Executor's commission             741 r. 16 m.\r\n    Administration                  1,237 r.\r\n    Expenses                          123 r. 18 m.\r\n    Total deductions                                 2,102 r.\r\n    Balance to be distributed among heirs          121,598 r.\r\n    Two-thirds left to brother as per will          81,066 r.\r\n    One-third left to parents as per will           40,532 r.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of the disposal of money left under slightly\r\ndifferent circumstances may be noted in the Royal Order of February\r\n14, 1800, to the juez de arribadas at Cádiz. The king ordered the\r\ntransmission of 8024 pesos to the royal treasury because of the\r\nimpossibility of finding the heirs of Antonio Manuel Pereda, who\r\ndied at Manila in 1767. By the terms of his will, 2000 pesos had been\r\nleft to the Third Order of St. Francis, 200 pesos to poor widows and\r\norphans, and the balance was left to his mother. The lady had died,\r\nhowever, and as there were no heirs apparent, the money was ordered\r\ntransferred to the royal treasury (A. I., 107-3-9).\r\n\r\nThese large sums, constantly on hand, intact and available, were always\r\na source of grave temptation to governors and treasury officials. Loans\r\nwere frequently taken from this fund for ordinary or unusual expenses\r\nof the government. At first the juez de difuntos objected forcibly to\r\nthe governor's seeming disregard of the royal instructions regarding\r\nthese funds. The laws of the Indies had commanded that they should be\r\nheld inviolable (Recopilación, 57, 70). As noted above, the practice\r\nhad arisen of making deductions from the subsidy equivalent to the\r\namount of bienes de difuntos produced in the Philippines, and of\r\nretaining the money in Acapulco. This practice worked havoc with the\r\nfulfillment of the law which had ordered that these funds be preserved\r\nintact. The governor and the treasury officials had fallen into the\r\npractice of appropriating such available funds as existed in the caja\r\nde difuntos for purposes of local administration, with the assurance\r\nthat the money would be properly accounted for in Mexico. Governor\r\nAnda seems to have been a leading offender in this matter. In 1767 he\r\nborrowed 19,729 pesos from the juez de difuntos and in 1768 another\r\nsum of 30,000 pesos was taken (Landazurri to the Council of the\r\nIndies, May 22, 1770, A. I., 107-3-9). By the cédula of October 9,\r\n1777, the king approved the action of Governor Anda in borrowing\r\nfrom these funds on three other occasions to the extent of 25,000,\r\n14,206, and 24,477 pesos, respectively, for the fortification of the\r\ncity. It was ordered that this should not be done again, however,\r\nexcept under extraordinary circumstances (A. I., 107-3-9).\r\n\r\nAfter being permitted for a long period of time, the practice which the\r\nManila authorities had followed of making these deductions was finally\r\ndisapproved by the home government. In 1806, because of the non-arrival\r\nof the galleon with the subsidy, the governor (and superintendent)\r\nauthorized an advance of 54,049 pesos from the bienes de difuntos,\r\nwhich sum constituted the entire amount on hand. On April 25, 1815,\r\nthe fiscal of the contaduría general de las Indias handed down an\r\nadverse opinion on this action (A. I., 107-3-9). Although the practice\r\nof allowing small loans from the funds of deceased persons had been\r\npracticed in the Philippines in case of exceptional circumstances,\r\nit was his opinion that the whole proceeding had been contrary to\r\nthe laws of the Indies (Recopilación, 2-32-57). He advised that in\r\nthe future there should be no interference with this money until the\r\ndeduction had been authorized by the juez de difuntos in Mexico,\r\nand the judge should act only after he had received the report of\r\nthe corresponding official in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIf the above advice were followed, at least a year would pass before\r\nthe report of the Manila judge could reach Mexico, and be returned. It\r\nwas not to be supposed that the officials in the Philippines would\r\nwait for any such formality when in need of money for the current\r\nexpenses of government. This is another example of the cumbrousness\r\nand lack of expedition of Spanish colonial administration, as affected\r\nby time and distance. It will be noted, also, that this practice\r\nhad been going on since the time of Anda (1768), and the Council of\r\nthe Indies did not pronounce against it decisively until 1815. The\r\nparticular litigation which brought about its condemnation arose in\r\n1806 and continued throughout a period of nine years.\r\n\r\n[334] Ibid., 60.

A. I., 107-3-9). The total receipts of the office of juez\r\nde difuntos in Manila for the year terminating January 25, 1819, were\r\n10,750 pesos. Payments against the fund that year were 27,747 pesos,\r\nwhich were made possible by a balance on hand at the beginning of the\r\nyear of 52,900 pesos (Report of Vicente de Posadas, Juez de Difuntos\r\nde Manila, January 25, 1819, A. I., 107-3-9). On March 31, 1828,\r\nthe funds of this department amounted to 32,657 pesos (A.

Note the brief discussion of this\r\nrelationship in Smith, The viceroy of New Spain, 152-156. Dr. Smith\r\nshows that the chief purpose of the Spanish government in establishing\r\nthe viceroy and audiencia together was to guarantee a check and\r\nbalance of one upon the other. Quoting Revilla Gigedo (Instruction,\r\nArticle 20), he says: \"The presidency of the audiencia places the\r\nviceroy at the head of that body but not to give orders to it, as\r\neven his acts in matters of justice are subject to it; and although\r\nhe is present at its sessions, which is very difficult, considering\r\nthe grave and continuous occupations which so vast a command imposes\r\nupon him, he does not have a vote in matters which are regularly\r\ndealt with there--that is, matters of justice.\" Dr. Smith shows (162)\r\nthat the effect of the later laws of the eighteenth century was to\r\ndeprive \"the viceroys absolutely of any part in the procedure of the\r\nadministration of justice, either alone or in company with the other\r\njudges, voting with them in the audiencia\" (from Revilla Gigedo,\r\nInstruction, Article 64). The limitation of the governor of the\r\nPhilippines in legal matters is discussed further on in this chapter.\r\n\r\n[371] See Moses, Establishment of Spanish rule in America, 70-71.\r\n\r\nPhilip III ordered the viceroy of New Spain to \"give aid to the\r\ngovernor and captain-general of the Philippines in whatever may occur,\r\nand above all ... to send him on demand whatever may seem necessary\r\nof arms, men, munitions, and money for the conservation of those\r\nIslands, salaries, and presidios, and other matters under his care\r\n(Recopilación, 3-4-13).\" The viceroys also exercised a certain degree\r\nof authority over the despatch of the galleons from Acapulco (ibid.,\r\n9-45-25 to 31, 47, 74 to 76). Aside from the points indicated, the\r\nPhilippines were normally as independent of New Spain as the latter\r\nwas independent of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[372] Bourne, \"Historical introduction,\" Blair and Robertson, I, 49-50.\r\n\r\n[373] Delgado, Historia de Filipinas, 212-215.\r\n\r\n[374] Delgado illustrates this statement as follows: \"The legitimate\r\nKing of Borney, who had been dispossessed of his kingdom ... begged\r\nfor help from Don Francisco Sande, Governor of these Islands. Governor\r\nSande went with his fleet, fought with and drove away the tyrant, and\r\nput the legitimate king in possession; the latter rendered obedience\r\nto the governor, appointed in the place of the King of España, and\r\nsubjected himself to this crown as vassal and tributary.\" Further on\r\nhe writes, \"His Majesty also ordered Sande, by a decree of April 9,\r\n1586, to sustain friendship with China, and forbade him to make war;\r\nfor, as some authors say, Sande had the intention of conquering\r\nthat Empire, ... although it may be said that the idea was simply\r\nspeculative; the Council forbade it, and ordered him thenceforth to\r\nobserve what was prescribed\" (ibid., see Blair and Robertson, XVII,\r\n317-320, whose translation differs slightly from the above).\r\n\r\n[375] Recopilación, 3-3-2; 63, 64; 3-14-1, 33.\r\n\r\n[376] Instructions to Acuña, February 16, 1602, Blair and Robertson,\r\nXI, 273-4.\r\n\r\n[377] Recopilación, 3-3-55; 3-2-33.\r\n\r\n[378] Ibid., 3-3-56; 2-15-159.\r\n\r\n[379] King to the Audiencia, December 4, 1777, A.

The observation of this law in Chile was commanded in\r\na royal order expedited to the president of the audiencia there on\r\nSeptember 22, 1725; see Recopilación, 2-16, note 13.\r\n\r\n[416] Ibid., note 14.\r\n\r\n[417] Ibid., 2-16-51.\r\n\r\n[418] Discussed in Chapter IV of this treatise.\r\n\r\n[419] Governors, captains-general, and viceroys were assisted by\r\nan asesor, or legal adviser, who gave his opinion in all matters\r\nof law that came up for solution. The necessity for this official\r\ndeveloped through the fact that as most governors were soldiers,\r\nthey were incapable of rendering judgment on legal and administrative\r\nquestions. As counselor to the governor, this official bore the same\r\nrelation to the executive as the fiscal did to the audiencia. The\r\nasesor was held responsible in the residencia for all decisions\r\nrendered by the governor in matters of justice, and in governmental\r\naffairs the governor and asesor were jointly responsible. Frequently\r\nthe asesor was able to block completely the work of the audiencia and\r\nhis opinion nullified the judgments of magistrates who were as learned\r\nin the law and as well qualified, if not better, than he. Martínez de\r\nZúñiga (Estadismo, I, 224) discusses the influence of the asesor in the\r\nfollowing terms: \"Expedientes are sent to one of the two royal fiscales\r\nto ascertain their legality; afterwards they are sent to the asesor\r\nwhom the governors must consult; the latter place (of asesor) is a very\r\ngood one, ... besides 2000 pesos as salary it has its private revenues\r\nin addition to 500 pesos yearly from each of the royal monopolies\r\n(discussed in Chapter V of this volume). There are many persons in\r\nManila who are exempted from ordinary justice through their military\r\nconnections or on account of being employed in the royal monopolies,\r\nand as they depend on him, he exercises great power; ... there are few\r\nwho desire him for an enemy, for when they least think of it they are\r\nin need of his favorable opinion in some expediente which they have\r\nbrought before the government.\" The laws of the Indies forbade that an\r\noidor should act as the governor's asesor if any other appointee with\r\nthe requisite qualifications were available (Recopilación, 3-3-35,\r\nand note). See cédula (and accompanying expedientes) of September 26,\r\n1756, A. I., 106-4-16.\r\n\r\n[420] Recopilación, 2-15-61 to 63, 169; 2-16-12, 31, 32.\r\n\r\n[421] Ibid., 2-15-38.\r\n\r\n[422] Ibid., 3-3-36, 38.\r\n\r\n[423] Ibid., 3-3-60. Relative to the relations of the viceroys and\r\naudiencias of the Spanish colonies, Robertson (The History of America,\r\nIV, 19-20) says: \"The Spanish viceroys have often attempted to intrude\r\nthemselves into the seat of justice, and with an ambition which\r\ntheir distance from the controul (sic) of a superior rendered bold,\r\nhave aspired at a power which their master does not venture to assume\r\n... the viceroys have been prohibited, in the most explicit terms,\r\nby repeated laws, from interfering in the judicial proceedings of the\r\ncourts of Audience, or from delivering an opinion, or giving a voice\r\nwith respect to any point litigated before them. In some particular\r\ncases, in which any question of civil right is involved, even the\r\npolitical regulations of the viceroy may be brought under review of\r\nthe court of Audience, which in those instances, may be deemed an\r\nintermediate power between him and the people, as a constitutional\r\nbarrier to circumscribe his jurisdiction. But as legal restraints\r\non a person who represents the sovereign, and is clothed with his\r\nauthority, are little suited to the genius of Spanish policy; the\r\nhesitation and reserve with which it confers this power on the courts\r\nof Audience are remarkable. They may advise, they may remonstrate;\r\nbut in the event of a direct collision between their opinion and the\r\nwill of the viceroy, what he determines must be brought into execution,\r\nand nothing remains for them, but to lay the matter before the king\r\nand the Council of the Indies.\"\r\n\r\n[424] Recopilación. 3-3-27, promulgated July 19, 1614, conferred\r\ngeneral pardoning power on the viceroy.\r\n\r\n[425] Regent to the King, July 9, 1793, A.

It is to be noted that the New Laws\r\nof 1542 conferred on the audiencias the duty of protecting the\r\nIndians. Professor Moses, in his Spanish dependencies in South America,\r\nI, (212-3), says: \"The audiencias were commanded to inquire into the\r\ntreatment which the Indians had received at the hands of governors\r\nand private persons; and, in case of excesses and ill-treatment, the\r\nguilty parties should be punished.... While it was acknowledged that\r\nsome persons had a sufficient title to hold Indians, it was ordered\r\nthat when the number held was excessive, the audiencia should gather\r\nthe necessary information and reduce the allotments made to the said\r\npersons in a fair and moderate quantity 'and place the rest under\r\nthe Crown'.\"\r\n\r\n[428] Ibid., 53.\r\n\r\n[429] Ibid., 3-3-61; 3-4-7. We have a notable illustration of this in\r\nthe banishment of Archbishop Poblete by Governor Salcedo (1663-1668) as\r\na result of the resistance of the former to Salcedo's intervention in\r\necclesiastical matters on the basis of the royal patronage.

Mas was a Spanish diplomatic official\r\nstationed in China, who visited the Islands in 1842 on a semi-official\r\nmission. This writer was not favorably impressed with the effectiveness\r\nof the acuerdo. He wrote: \"Whatever difficulty occurs in the fulfilment\r\nof an order, it must be solved by means of a conference and advice\r\n[consulta], from which a reply is not obtained until from twelve\r\nto fourteen months.\" Instead of governmental matters being referred\r\nto the acuerdo, Mas stated that they were referred to Spain, hence\r\nthere was great delay. He stated that the governor scarcely decided\r\nany question by himself, and those which were solved in the colony\r\nwere referred to the asesor, and \"from this practice,\" he continued,\r\n\"arises the system of expedientes, which reigns, and which is so fatal\r\nto the prosperity and good government of the country, since very often\r\nthe arrangement that appears good to some, is contrary to the opinions\r\nor interests of others.... Thus much valuable time is lost and the\r\nexpedientes result in only a waste of paper, besides great injury\r\nto the islands. The governor often has to conform to the opinions\r\nexpressed in the expediente, although he knows they will be the cause\r\nof injustice. On the other hand, the governor is often directly at\r\nfault, because he enforces his own opinion on his assessor (sp.), who\r\nhas often obtained his position through favoritism and is not a lawyer,\r\nand decides questions according to the will of the governor.... The\r\nchiefs of the various departments carry on correspondence with the\r\ndirectors-general of their respective departments in Madrid, without\r\nthe knowledge of the governor, a fact that increases the confusion\r\nand disorder.\" (See also Revilla Gigedo's description of the evils of\r\nthe expediente in New Spain [1790]. Smith, The viceroy of New Spain,\r\n190-191.)\r\n\r\nThis description of the Philippine government in 1842 would seem\r\nto indicate that aside from the limitations imposed upon his rule\r\nby the audiencia, the governor was obliged to contend with a number\r\nof other officials, departments, and regulations, which effectively\r\nprevented him from exercising absolute power, even at the sacrifice\r\nof efficiency. We note in this description, moreover, that tendency\r\nof Spanish colonial government which has been emphasized so often in\r\nthis treatise--namely, the failure of the home government to leave\r\nto the colonial officials sufficient scope of action or authority\r\nto deal adequately with the ordinary problems of government. Up to\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century the audiencia was the only civil\r\nauthority or tribunal present to exercise any check on the executive\r\nin administrative affairs. However, in the last century the importance\r\nof the audiencia in this regard was diminished by the creation of\r\nother departments, ministries, and offices, by the elimination of\r\ntime and space, due to the progress of invention, which brought the\r\ncolonies nearer to Spain, and finally by the fact that the tribunal\r\nitself was more and more confined to judicial affairs.\r\n\r\n[448] Governor Torres to the Queen, March 18, 1835, A. I., 106-4-21.\r\n\r\n[449] Colección legislativa de España, LXXXVI, 1-45. Elliott, in\r\nhis Philippines to the end of the military regime, p. 242, states\r\nincorrectly that this reform took place in 1865. Mr. Elliott did not\r\nmake use of the sources. It is to be noted, too, that Dr. Barrows\r\nin his article on \"The governor general of the Philippines,\" in The\r\nPacific Ocean in history makes contradictory statements relative to\r\nthis matter. On page 242 he asserts that the governor was president\r\nof the audiencia till 1844, and on page 248 the statement occurs that\r\n\"a further specialization of 1861 deprived the governor-general of\r\nhis judicial powers.\"\r\n\r\n[450] Instruction of the King to Governor Acuña, February 16, 1602,\r\nBlair and Robertson, XI, 263-88.\r\n\r\n[451] Fray Sánchez, in his memorial of July 26, 1586, stated that\r\nthe audiencia had stopped the practice of conceding encomiendas\r\n(A. I., 67-6-27), which the governors had followed prior to its\r\nestablishment. Nevertheless the governor's authority to bestow\r\nencomiendas was recognized by the royal instructions to Governor\r\nDasmariñas, issued May 25, 1593 (Blair and Robertson, IX, 232). The\r\nstatement of Sánchez may be interpreted to mean that the audiencia\r\nhad stopped the abuses which had been perpetrated by various governors\r\nin bestowing encomiendas on their friends. Encomiendas were conceded\r\nby different governors in the Philippines throughout the eighteenth\r\ncentury. This matter has been discussed in an earlier note.\r\n\r\n[452] Mas, \"Internal political conditions of the Philippines, 1842,\"\r\nBlair and Robertson, LII, 69-70 and note. The keen observations of this\r\nofficial on social and governmental conditions in the Philippines are\r\npeculiarly pertinent, and they are as true in many regards today as\r\nthey were seventy-five years ago. He recommended a regency to govern\r\nthe Philippines, consisting of the governor as president, a military\r\ncommander and an intendant of finance. The audiencia, according to his\r\nplan of reform, was to be limited to judicial affairs, with appellate\r\njurisdiction over civil, criminal, and commercial cases. Instead of\r\nthe audiencia as a court of appeals against the governor, the regency\r\nwas to entertain appeals from the audiencia. Many of his ideas were\r\nincorporated into the new laws of the last half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury (ibid., 78-85).\r\n\r\n[453] Recopilación, 5-12-22; 2-15-35; 36, 41.\r\n\r\n[454] Ibid., 3-3-51.\r\n\r\n[455] Ibid., 2-15-35, 36, 41; 3-3-2, 34, 42; 3-14-1; 5-12-22.\r\n\r\n[456] Acuña to Felipe III, July 15, 1604, Blair and Robertson,\r\nXIII, 235.

He stated that it was the opinion of all right-thinking men\r\nthat soldiers were of more use in the colony than judges (ibid., 237).\r\n\r\n[457] The terms of these governors were as follows: Fajardo, 1618-1624;\r\nCorcuera, 1635-1644; Vargas, 1678-1684; Arandía, 1754-1759; Anda,\r\n1762-1764, 1770-1776.\r\n\r\n[458] Rios Coronel to the King, June 27, 1597, A.

This was\r\nthe practice followed in other parts, he said, but it was undesirable\r\nin the Philippines on account of the isolation and the distance. He\r\nrecommended instead that these cases should be appealed to a board\r\nconsisting of the governor and two asesores--one his own, and the\r\nother an oidor to be designated by him.

He said that the lack of time alleged by the oidor was\r\na mere pretense, as the regular sessions of the audiencia did not\r\nexceed three hours a day. The governor stated that none of the oidores\r\nwere occupied more than that length of time, excepting those who\r\nhad special conservatorships of cockpits, tobacco, cards, betel, and\r\nwine. The suits of Spaniards and Indians were few, he alleged, since\r\nmost of the questions involving commerce were tried in the tribunal\r\nof the consulado (Governor Marquina to the superintendent-general,\r\nJuly 10, 1789, A.

Delgado says\r\nthat Governor Sande called this council together on April 9, 1586,\r\nevidently meaning Santiago de Vera, as the latter became governor\r\nin 1584, and Sande left the Islands in 1580.

On\r\nthe occasion referred to, it acted as a courtmartial. It also had power\r\nto advise the governor, and even to prevent the military officials from\r\ntaking steps which would inflict injustice on the natives in connection\r\nwith military operations. Here it may be seen that magistrates were\r\nactually members of this council, and in this capacity they advised\r\nthe governor as to the best means of fortifying and defending the\r\nIslands.

Don Antonio de Morga, writing in his\r\nSucesos in 1609, described the Chinese government of the Parián as\r\nfollows: \"The Chinese have a governor of their own race, a Christian,\r\nwho has his officials and assistants. He hears their cases in affairs\r\nof justice, in their domestic and business affairs; appeals from him\r\ngo to the alcalde-mayor of Tondo, or of the Parián, and from all these\r\nto the Audiencia, which also gives especial attention to this nation\r\nand whatever pertains to it\" (Morga's Sucesos, Blair and Robertson,\r\nXVI, 197). See W. L. Schurz, \"The Chinese in the Philippines,\" in\r\nThe Pacific Ocean in history, 214-222.\r\n\r\n[501] The Chinese were altogether too shrewd in business for the other\r\nresidents of Manila. The desire to avoid trouble and to keep from\r\nprovoking the Chinese to rebellion were also factors, and there were\r\ninstitutional and religious reasons. The Chinese were of different\r\nrace and heritage and their practices and beliefs were regarded by\r\nthe Catholic Spaniards as altogether heathenish and heretical, and\r\njudging by almost any standard of morality and cleanliness it must\r\nbe conceded that some of them at least were indecent and revolting.\r\n\r\n[502] Cédula of December 1, 1606, A.

Chinese who\r\nwere engaged in agriculture paid merely the tribute of twelve reales,\r\nwhich was collected from natives as well. In addition to the tax of\r\nsix dollars (probably Mexican, which were equivalent to the silver\r\npeso) merchants paid an industrial tax of twelve, thirty, sixty, or\r\none hundred dollars, according to the amount of business transacted\r\n(Blair and Robertson, LII, 57-58, note).\r\n\r\n[514] Consulta of June 28, 1786; Intendant Carvajal to King, December\r\n31, 1787, and other letters; A.

Wholesale bribery was the leading charge against\r\nhim. He had levied blackmail on alcaldes mayores, encomenderos, and\r\nChinese and Spanish merchants. He was also charged with the misuse of\r\ngovernment funds, and was held responsible for large deficits. It was\r\nsaid that he had sent his wife to Macao with most of this ill-gotten\r\nmoney. In his residencia he was fined 120,000 pesos, exiled forever\r\nfrom Madrid, Manila and New Spain, and was reduced subsequently to\r\nsuch poverty that he was compelled to beg.

I.,\r\n68-2-8. In this consulta an effort is made to fix responsibility for\r\nthe murder of the governor, and to determine the legality of his acts.\r\n\r\n[546] This refers to the reception of the French papal delegate,\r\nTourón, who came to the Islands to inspect the archbishopric, and who\r\nwas received by the audiencia without the authority of the Council\r\nof the Indies. This will be treated further in Chapter X of this book.\r\n\r\n[547] Fr. Diego de Otazo, the Jesuit confessor of Bustamante, in a\r\nletter to his superior, described the power of the governor and his\r\ntreatment of the audiencia as follows: \"Here, my father,\" he wrote,\r\n\"the governor takes away and establishes, gives, commands, unmakes and\r\nmakes more despotically than does the king himself;... Royal decrees\r\nare not sufficient; for either he hides them, or he does not fulfill\r\nthem as he ought. The Audiencia does not serve [as a check] on him,\r\nfor he suppresses and he establishes it, when and how he pleases;\r\nnor do other bodies, whether chapters or [religious] communities\r\n(dare to oppose him), ... for he does the same thing [with them]. And\r\nnever do there lack pretexts for doing thus, even though such bodies\r\nare appointed by the king; and with the pretext that account of the\r\nmatter has already been rendered to Madrid, what he has begun remains\r\npermanently done, or else he proceeds to change it, as seems good to\r\nhim.\" (Letter of Diego de Otazo, S.

Accordingly the governors, in order not to\r\ndisplease the auditors, give up their claims and dare not insist upon\r\nthem\" (ibid., 234).\r\n\r\n[563] Acuña further commented on their commercial abuses: \"The said\r\ncreatures and connections of the said auditors trade and traffic a\r\ngreat deal in merchandise from China; and the citizens complain that\r\nit is with the auditors' money (their own or borrowed), and that with\r\nthe favor they receive they cause great injury to the commonwealth, for\r\nthey take up the whole cargo. They desire to be preferred therein, and\r\nin buying the cloth and in every other way, try to take advantage. If\r\nthe president wishes to remedy this they do not cease to offer him\r\nlittle annoyances; for the auditors know how to magnify themselves,\r\nin such a manner that they give one to understand that any one of\r\nthem is greater than he; and they attain this by saying that what\r\nthe president or governor does they can cancel, and that what the\r\nauditors decree has no appeal, recourse, or redress\" (ibid., 234-5).\r\n\r\nAcuña testified that the magistrates had rendered life unpleasant\r\nfor the residents of the colony, because of their selfishness. He\r\ncontinued: \"the resources of this land are scanty, but if there is\r\nanything good the auditors also say that they want it for themselves;\r\nand when there is a Chinese embroiderer, tailor, carver, or other\r\nworkman, they proceed to take him.... Such benefits do not extend\r\nto the citizens; but rather, if any of these things are available,\r\nthe said auditors demand them and by entreaty and intimidation get\r\npossession of them. It is the same thing in regard to jewels, slave men\r\nand women, articles of dress, and other things.... We are compelled\r\nto overlook these things, and others of more importance, that we may\r\nnot experience worse trouble; ... as your Majesty is five thousand\r\nleguas from here and redress comes so slowly\" (ibid., 235-236).\r\n\r\n[564] Their salaries must be preferred, he wrote, \"even if it be\r\nfrom the stated fund for the religious orders, bishops, ministers\r\nof instruction, and for the military forces, who are before them in\r\norder,--they have difficulties and misunderstandings with the royal\r\nofficials (ibid., 236) ... as the treasury is always straitened\r\n(sic), and, on account of the great care which the auditors take\r\nto collect their salaries, as it cannot be so prompt as they would\r\nwish, they seek borrowed money from the citizens--who give it to\r\nthem, willingly or unwillingly, each one according to his means or\r\ndesigns. From this follow difficulties, to which they pay no heed;\r\nas some of them demand these loans from persons who are parties to\r\nsuits at the time, who grant these to the auditors in order to place\r\nthem under obligations, and profit by them\" (ibid., 239).\r\n\r\n[565] The rebellion referred to here occurred in 1603. It was said to\r\nhave been instigated by two mysterious mandarins who came to Manila for\r\nthe alleged purpose of searching for a mountain of silver, which was\r\nlocated near Cavite. On the Eve of St. Francis the Chinese made their\r\nattack with great success, owing, the ecclesiastical element claimed,\r\nto the personal intervention of St. Francis, who appeared on the\r\nwalls and led his followers to victory. In this revolt 24,000 Chinese\r\nwere hunted down and slain. In 1639 another rebellion occurred. A\r\nthird insurrection of the Chinese took place in 1660. In 1763 the\r\nChinese joined with the British in their attack on the city. It is\r\nestimated that Anda, in his campaign in the provinces, put an end\r\nto 6,000 Chinese. Another massacre, and the last in the history of\r\nthe Islands, took place in 1820. This was an uprising of the natives\r\nagainst all foreigners who were thought to be responsible for the\r\nplague of cholera then raging (Foreman, Philippine Islands, 108-119;\r\nA. I., 105-1 to 10 and 68-1-27).\r\n\r\n[566] The entire dependence of the colony on the Chinese trade is\r\nattested by Concepción (Historia general, IV, 53). He states that:\r\n\"Without the trade and commerce of the Chinese these dominions could\r\nnot have subsisted.\" Morga, in his Sucesos (349), further testifies:\r\n\"It is true the town cannot exist without the Chinese, as they are\r\nthe workers in all trades and business, and are very industrious,\r\nworking for small wages.\"\r\n\r\n[567] Acuña to Felipe III, July 15, 1604, Blair and Robertson, XIII,\r\n239-241.\r\n\r\n[568] Fajardo described \"the oppression caused by the multitude of\r\nrelatives and followers (of the auditors); their appropriation of\r\nthe offices and emoluments, to the injury of the meritorious; their\r\nhatred and hostility to those who unfortunately fall out with them;\r\ntheir trading and trafficking, although it be by an intermediary, since\r\nthey, being men of influence, buy the goods at wholesale and protect\r\ntheir agents.\" He stated that this caused him great embarrassment and\r\nmade good government almost an impossibility (Fajardo to Felipe III,\r\nAugust 10, 1618, Blair and Robertson, XVIII, 126).\r\n\r\n[569] \"The auditors,\" Fajardo wrote, \"have few important matters that\r\noblige them to close application, (and) they must apply the greater\r\npart of their time to devising petty tricks on the president in order\r\nto vex and weary him, until, [as they hope] not only will he allow them\r\nto live according to their own inclination but also their relatives\r\nand followers shall, in whatever posts they desire, be employed and\r\nprofited. And since harmony has never been seen here without this\r\nexpedient, one would think it easy to believe such a supposition\"\r\n(Fajardo to the King, August 15, 1620, Blair and Robertson, XIX,\r\n120-121).\r\n\r\n[570] Recopilación, 8-20, 21, 22.\r\n\r\n[571] Decree written on margin of letter: Fajardo to the King, August\r\n15, 1620, Blair and Robertson, XIX, 136.\r\n\r\n[572] Ibid., 122.\r\n\r\n[573] Fajardo to Felipe III, August 10, 1618, Blair and Robertson,\r\nXVIII, 126.\r\n\r\n[574] Fajardo to the King, July 21, 1621, Blair and Robertson, XX, 53.\r\n\r\n[575] Ibid., 54.

But may God not\r\nchoose that I should be relieved from the service of your Majesty,\r\nin which from the age of fifteen years I have been engaged; ... It\r\nwould be no little pleasure to me to be employed in naval and military\r\naffairs and other things in which, with my counsel and my personal\r\naid, I might be able to help; and to know that the matter of auditors\r\nand their demands, their rivalries, and their faultfinding, should\r\nconcern another.\"--Ibid., 55-56.\r\n\r\n[576] Concepción, Historia general.

Gasca was ordered to restore that viceroyalty\r\nto the sovereignty of Spain, and to do whatever the king would do under\r\nlike circumstances. This was in May, 1546. \"He (Gasca) was at the head\r\nof every department of the administration,\" writes Professor Moses;\r\n\"he might raise troops, appoint and remove officers, and declare war;\r\nhe might exercise the royal prerogative of pardoning offenses; and was\r\nespecially commissioned to grant an amnesty to all who had been engaged\r\nin the rebellion. He was authorized to revoke the ordinances which\r\nhad caused the popular uprising and the overthrow of Blasco Núñez;\r\nand, returning to the earlier practice, he might make repartimientos,\r\nor confirm those which had been previously made.

This tribunal bore the same relation to the audiencia and viceroy\r\nin Mexico as did that of Santa Fé de Bogotá to those in Lima. The\r\nAudiencia of Nueva Galicia had both judicial and administrative\r\nfunctions, exercising its jurisdiction over the partidos and\r\ncorregimientos, with their respective alcaldes and corregidores. It\r\nconcerned itself, moreover, with projects of conquest, discovery,\r\nthe development of mines, and internal improvement. Subsequently this\r\naudiencia was transferred to Guadalajara and given that name. See\r\nRecopilación, 2-15-7.\r\n\r\n[591] Bancroft, History of Mexico, II, 586.\r\n\r\n[592] Ibid., II, 602-7.\r\n\r\n[593] It is interesting to note that in 1564, while the Audiencia of\r\nMexico was governing ad interim, the voyage of Legaspi and Urdaneta\r\nwas undertaken, and the first permanent settlement was made in the\r\nPhilippines by authorization of that tribunal. Bancroft (History of\r\nMexico, II, 599-600) is both indefinite and inaccurate in his account\r\nof the expedition of Legaspi and Urdaneta to the Philippines. He\r\nsays: \"Finally on the 21st of November, 1564, the squadron sailed,\r\nand after a prosperous voyage, reached Luzón, where Legaspi founded\r\nthe city of Manila.\" It is well known that Legaspi did not sail\r\ndirectly to Luzón, as Bancroft implies, but he visited a number of\r\nislands in the Archipelago before he settled at Cebú on April 27,\r\n1565. Manila was not formally claimed until May 19, 1571 (Montero y\r\nVidal, Historia general, I, 39; Martínez de Zúñiga, An historical view,\r\n113-119). Bancroft (op. cit., II, 743) states that Manila was founded\r\nin 1564 by Miguel de Legaspi. Manila was a prosperous commercial center\r\nbefore the Spaniards came to the Islands. Dr. James A. Robertson in his\r\narticle entitled \"Legaspi and Philippine colonization\" (see American\r\nHistorical Association, Annual report, 1907, I, 154), states on the\r\nbasis of original documents that \"this well-situated and busy trade\r\ncenter was erected into a Spanish city on June 3, 1571, and on the\r\n24th the necessary officials were appointed.\" Dr. Robertson states\r\nin a note (p. 154) that \"possession was taken of Luzon, June 6, 1570.\"\r\n\r\n[594] Recopilación, 8-4-24.\r\n\r\n[595] Ibid., 3-2-47.\r\n\r\n[596] Ibid., 2-15-47 and 48.\r\n\r\n[597] King to the Audiencia, November 23, 1774, quotes the cédula\r\nof September 13, 1608, as testimonio; A.

The fiscal objected to this illegal procedure, as he termed it,\r\nalleging that the governor was not authorized by law to choose his\r\nown successor. He pointed out that, according to the existing laws,\r\nthe senior magistrate should succeed to the military command by his\r\nown right, without the interference either of the governor or the\r\naudiencia. Notwithstanding this protest, Almansa continued to hold\r\nthe post of acting captain-general, for which it was said that he\r\nwas better fitted than Maldonado.\r\n\r\n[611] Audiencia to Felipe III, July 6, 1606, Blair and Robertson,\r\nXIV, 140-148. These demands were ultimately met by a subsidy from\r\nthe treasury of New Spain. It may be remarked in this connection,\r\nthat the oidores were probably interested in somewhat more than\r\nincreased revenue for defense, since they were known to have been\r\nabsorbed in commercial ventures. This episode marks the beginning of\r\na struggle on the part of the Manila merchants for increased trading\r\nprivileges--a battle which continued until the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. They were opposed by the merchants of Cádiz and Seville,\r\nand it was in the interest of these last-mentioned cities that the\r\nManila trade was restricted (Royal order of November 10, 1605, and\r\nKing to the Audiencia, February 6, 1606, A. I., 105-2-1).\r\n\r\n[612] Although the laws of the Indies forbade the oidores from trading\r\n(Recopilación, 2-16-59, 60, 62, 64, 66), and the correspondence of the\r\nperiod shows that the oidores were at first denied trading privileges,\r\n(King to Conde de Monterrey, April 14, 1597; A. I., 105-2-1), they\r\nwere allowed to send to Spain sufficient cloth, silk and other\r\ndress materials for their own use and for that of their families\r\n(Recopilación, 2-16-63). This last-mentioned privilege was abused,\r\nhowever, until the right of each official to send only a limited\r\namount of cargo on the galleon was generally recognized. For example,\r\nthe cargo list of the galleon \"Trinidad\" in 1753, shows that ministers\r\nwere assigned six boletas, or bales, of the nominal value of 125 pesos\r\neach--that being only half the amount usually allowed. This reduction,\r\neffected by Governor Arandía, caused much opposition on the part of\r\nthe audiencia (Expediente of January 30, 1754; A. I., 108-3-11). The\r\nofficials having first claim on the right to send goods in the galleon\r\nwere those of the municipal cabildo of Manila. On March 27, 1714, they\r\nwere conceded the right to ship 132 fardillos, the specifications of\r\nwhich were not given. It was mentioned, however, in the consulta which\r\nrecommended this bestowal that this was a re-enactment of the grant\r\nof 1699, and that it was the policy of the king to be generous to the\r\nregidores in this matter because they were not given salaries (A. I.,\r\n68-2-8). The royal order of June 30, 1786, bestowed on the regidores\r\nthe right to ship one ton of goods. This right was confirmed by the\r\nconsulta of October 7, 1789 (A. I., 105-3-5). The cédula of April\r\n25, 1803, conceded five boletas, each valued at one hundred pesos,\r\nto each regidor. The oidores were each allowed ten boletas by this\r\ncédula (A. I., 106-2-15).\r\n\r\n[613] Audiencia to Felipe III, July 6, 1606, Blair and Robertson,\r\nXIV, 147.\r\n\r\n[614] Martínez de Zúñiga, An historical view, I, 230-331.\r\n\r\n[615] Ibid., I, 239, et seq.; Montero y Vidal, Historia general, I,\r\n162, et seq.\r\n\r\n[616] Martínez de Zúñiga, op. cit., I, 241; Montero y Vidal, op. cit.,\r\nI, 166.\r\n\r\n[617] Inventario de Residencias, A.

The power to grant encomiendas for the period of its\r\ntemporary rule was granted October 24, 1655. Moreover, by cédulas of\r\nMay 25, 1596, August 24, 1619, and September 5, 1620, the audiencia\r\nwas conceded authority to make temporary appointments to offices when\r\nit assumed the government ad interim (Recopilación, 2-15-56; 3-2-47;\r\n3-2-11 and 12).\r\n\r\n[622] Fajardo to Felipe III, August 10, 1618, Blair and Robertson,\r\nXVIII, 124-125.\r\n\r\n[623] Martínez de Zúñiga, An historical view, I, 250-251. The latter\r\nSilva was a relative of the viceroy, the Marqués de Cerralbo. He\r\nwas well known in the Philippines, where he had formerly resided and\r\nmarried the daughter of an influential resident. He held the temporary\r\ngovernorship about a year. It was during his administration, and\r\nthrough his efforts, that the first Spanish expedition was made to\r\nFormosa, Silva having ordered the alcalde mayor of Cagayán to land\r\nthere with a military force and establish fortifications. This was\r\ndone; thereupon a large number of Dominican friars sought and obtained\r\npermission for the spiritual conquest of the Island. Zúñiga says that\r\nthe latter \"exerted themselves with such zeal, that in a short time\r\nthey built several towns, and were able to number the greater part\r\nof the natives among the professors of our faith\" (ibid., I, 252-253;\r\nMontero y Vidal, Historia general, I, 180-181).\r\n\r\n[624] Audiencia to the King, July 24 and August 15, 1624, Blair and\r\nRobertson, XXI, 84-97.\r\n\r\n[625] Silva to Felipe IV, August 4, 1625, Blair and Robertson,\r\nXXII, 62-78.\r\n\r\n[626] Ibid., XXII, 66. The governor estimated the services of the\r\nmagistrates in a special report to the king on July 30, 1626. He\r\nstated that Messa was \"an upright judge, and zealous in the service\r\nof your Majesty.\" His comments on the other three were as follows:\r\n\"Geronimo de Lagaspi does what his two sons wish, whom, on account\r\nof their reckless lives, the governors cannot employ, and thus they\r\nare unable to satisfy their father, who is not contented except with\r\nfavors. Don Juan de Valderrama does as his wife says; and Don Matias\r\nFlores, although a young man, is less harmful;... He makes all the\r\nprofit he can from the office, and on the whole is not acceptable to\r\nthe community, which is always disturbed by him\" (Silva to Felipe IV,\r\nJuly 30, 1626, Blair and Robertson, XXII, 102).\r\n\r\n[627] Instructions to Francisco de Rojas y Ornate, August 17, 1628,\r\nA.

He wrote: \"Your Majesty has conceded to your viceroys of Nueva\r\nEspaña authority, in case of deaths and vacancies in this government,\r\nto send commissions to those who are to have charge of military\r\nmatters; and until the arrival of the regularly appointed governor\r\nyou order them to send another governor from Mexico\" (Corcuera to\r\nFelipe IV, June 30, 1636, Blair and Robertson, XXVI, 150).\r\n\r\n[630] Cédula of January 30, 1635, A.

On June 30, 1716, Torralba forwarded\r\nan elaborate memorial to the king, showing that the finances were\r\nin an excellent state, a net gain of 38,554 pesos having accrued to\r\nthe treasury since the beginning of the audiencia's rule. On the day\r\nthat this report was filed there existed in the treasury, according to\r\nTorralba's figures, a favorable balance of 294,000 pesos. This report\r\ncontains the following interesting data: Income from the subsidy,\r\n250,000 pesos; betel monopoly, 13,167 pesos; tributes, 109,152\r\npesos; royal auctions, 20,377 pesos; medias anatas, 16,373 pesos;\r\nalmojarifazgo, 20,377 pesos; wine monopoly, 14,000 pesos (Report of\r\nTorralba on Financial Affairs, June 30, 1716, A.

In a\r\nletter dated July 8, 1716, Torralba reported his compliance with the\r\ncédula of October 10, 1713, by means of which the king had appealed\r\nfor a \"free gift or contribution on the part of the inhabitants of the\r\nIslands to assist in putting down a Catalonian conspiracy.\" Torralba\r\nstated that the audiencia had seen to the fulfillment of this command\r\nand had collected the sum of 7,042 pesos (Torralba to King, July 8,\r\n1716, A. I., 68-4-18).\r\n\r\n[643] Concepción, Historia general, IX, 44, et seq.

The archbishop,\r\nwho had assumed the reins of government, was the only person\r\nwhose mind was not at ease; but in a short time he was restored to\r\ntranquillity by the arrival of a royal order, enjoining him to suspend\r\nthe Governor from his office, and imprison him; replace the Royal\r\nAudience on the same footing as before; set at liberty Señor Velasco\r\n(an oidor who had been imprisoned by Torralba), and assume the reins\r\nof government himself, which was exactly what had been effected by\r\nthe late disturbance.\"--Martínez de Zúñiga, op. cit., II, 39-40.\r\n\r\n[649] Royal order of September 8, 1720, A.

Two years later, the home\r\ngovernment showed its disapprobation of the rigorous acts of Cuesta\r\nby demoting him from his place as Archbishop of the Philippines to\r\nthe minor post of Bishop of Mechoacán in New Spain (Montero y Vidal,\r\nHistoria general, I, 432). The assumption of the government by Cuesta\r\ninvited the suspicion that he had been a party to the murder of the\r\ngovernor. Seven archbishops had already ruled on various occasions\r\nin New Spain (Bolton, Guide, 469-470).

Evidently he had all the qualifications necessary to fill\r\nthe office of governor, for he had been a member of the Audiencia of\r\nQuito for seventeen years, and had been also a member of the Council\r\nof the Indies (Blair and Robertson, XLVIII, 145-146).\r\n\r\n[652] Martínez de Zúñiga, An historical view, II, 89-90.\r\n\r\n[653] Opinion of Pedro Calderón Enríquez, July 26, 1759.

His obstinacy in submitting the Islands to the dominion\r\nof the English; his struggles against Anda ... his absolute ignorance\r\nof his powers ... his pardonable ignorance of whatever concerned the\r\nmilitary defense of the archipelago, his calm submission to whatever\r\nthe English advised, even in matters clearly opposed to the integrity\r\nand interests of Spain ... give an exact idea of the capacity and\r\ncharacter of the unfortunate one who had the misfortune in such\r\nan anxious time to exercise a command for which he was lacking in\r\nintelligence, valor and in all other attributes necessary to its\r\nsuccessful accomplishment.\"\r\n\r\nLe Gentil (Voyage, II, 252) characterizes him as follows: \"Archbishop\r\nRojo was a capable man for the management of finances; he was clever\r\nin business and very zealous for the service of the king; but he did\r\nnot understand anything of military affairs; ... he was between two\r\nfires, and being of an irresolute disposition, he did not know which\r\nway to turn, ... besieged on one side by oidores, on the other side\r\nby monks, he would not (otherwise) have waited till the English were\r\non the assault.\"\r\n\r\nCharges of indecent living and riotous conduct were made by Anda in\r\nhis various letters to the Archbishop. While the English were at the\r\ngates of the city, the prelate was passing his hours with indecent\r\nwomen. Anda stated that Rojo alternated between the dance-hall and\r\nthe pulpit, leaving to others the question of defense. Anda stated\r\nthat Rojo had allowed himself to be influenced by the traitorous\r\nSantiago de Orendaín, refusing to listen to the more loyal counsel\r\nof the king's ministers (Blair and Robertson, XLIX, 132-160).\r\n\r\nFrancisco Leandro de Viana, the fiscal, believed that the archbishop\r\nneither wished to be a traitor to the king nor to his country, but\r\nhe asserted that he (Viana) was the only person in the colony who was\r\nso charitable in his opinion. He felt that Rojo's stand was a result\r\nof his incapacity, timorousness, irresolution and ignorance. Viana,\r\nlike Anda, commented on the archbishop's lasciviousness and immorality\r\n(Viana to Rojo, March 1, 1763, A. I., 107-3-2).\r\n\r\nZúñiga, the ecclesiastical historian, seeing through priestly eyes,\r\naffirmed that Rojo was guilty of only one error during his rule. This\r\nwas his engagement to pay four millions of pesos to the English and\r\nto deliver up the Islands to them (Martínez de Zúñiga, An historical\r\nview, II, 239).\r\n\r\n[666] Anda to Rojo, October 20, 1762, Blair and Robertson, XLIX,\r\n153-154.\r\n\r\n[667] When news of the temporary suspension of hostilities reached\r\nhim in July, 1763, Anda refused to place confidence in the assurances\r\neither of the British or of the archbishop. He held out until the\r\narrival of the new governor, Francisco Xavier de la Torre. See Anda\r\nto Rojo, July 29, 1763, A.

On October 20, 1762,\r\nAnda wrote as follows: \"I said and I repeat that the presidency and\r\ngovernment fell to the royal Audiencia; and I add that the latter is\r\nconserved and continued in me, that I am the sole and only minister,\r\nthat by my absence from that capital because of the commissions\r\nconfided to me at a convenient time, I remained free from the enemies\r\n... so that in my person is met the prescriptions of law clxxx of\r\nthe above-cited book and título, since my associates are lacking and\r\nhave been imprisoned with your Excellency in the fatal loss of that\r\ncapital.\" (Blair and Robertson, XLIX, 136).\r\n\r\n[670] Relación de la conquista de Manila por los Ingleses,\r\n... 1761-1764, A.

Anda subsequently\r\nreported to Governor Torre that the capture of the treasure of the\r\n\"Filipino\" made possible the conservation of the Islands, \"and that\r\nthe English did not leave them completely desolate, since without this\r\naid, the subsistence of the state would have been impossible.\" (Anda\r\nto Carlos III, June and July, 1764, Blair and Robertson, XLIX, 299).\r\n\r\nThe fact that the galleon carried a cargo of over two million pesos\r\naffords no small insight into the way in which the merchants and\r\nofficials obeyed the law which forbade an annual return exceeding\r\n1,000,000 pesos.

Notice had been\r\nserved on Anda several times that suspensions of military operations\r\nhad been authorized, but the oidor-gobernador was suspicious, and\r\nwould not respond to the overtures of the British. The Spanish troops\r\nunder Anda's command entered Manila on June 10, 1764, and the British\r\nforces evacuated the same day. Montero y Vidal (op. cit., II, 71)\r\nstates that the new governor, Torre, feigned illness on the day of\r\nthe transfer of sovereignty that Anda might be enabled to receive the\r\nkeys of the city and thus not be deprived of the honors which he had\r\nso faithfully earned.\r\n\r\n[681] Martínez de Zúñiga, An historical view, II, 241.\r\n\r\n[682] Anda was made Councillor of Castile on November 6, 1767.

This is\r\ndiscussed in Chapter II of this volume. Original materials exist in\r\nA.

By the first two bulls the temporal and\r\nspiritual jurisdiction of the Indies was conceded to the monarchs of\r\nSpain and by the last one the universal patronato was given. Aside from\r\nthe responsibilities of government, this concession involved the duty\r\nof christianizing the natives and the right of collecting tithes from\r\nthem. By virtue of these papal bulls the Spanish rulers were granted\r\nthe right of nominating prelates for the Indies, the assignment of\r\nbenefices and provinces to the different orders, the confirmation of\r\nminor ecclesiastical appointments, and, in fact, general supervision\r\nand control over the regular and secular clergy in the colonies\r\n(Recopilación, 1-6-1 to 7). By these acts the pope was relieved of\r\nall direct responsibility for the spiritual government of Spain's\r\nover-sea dominions, his authority being limited to the approval of\r\nprelates nominated by the Spanish king and to other ecclesiastical\r\nduties of a nominal character.\r\n\r\nThe patronato real in Spain furnished a precedent for that of her\r\ncolonial empire. Although the royal patronage in Spain and in the\r\ncolonies were closely associated, the beginning of this relationship\r\nmay be found in the early years of Spanish history, when concessions\r\nwere granted by the king to nobles, cities, and similarly, to\r\nchurchmen, in exchange for fealty of some sort. For example, the\r\nvast tracts of land in Spain were received by the church as a gift\r\nfrom the state, wherefore the state reserved the right to declare who\r\nshould hold these lands and enjoy these privileges and also the power\r\nto dictate the conditions under which they were to be held. The right\r\nof appointment by the crown to vacant benefices and to all the higher\r\nchurch offices were applications of this principle. (See Cunningham,\r\n\"The institutional background of Latin American history,\" in the\r\nHispanic American historical review, Vol, I, pp. 24-39.)\r\n\r\nThe concession of 1501 by Alexander VI was only one of a number of\r\nprivileges of the sort accorded by the popes to the Spanish crown. The\r\nemperor, Charles V, obtained from Pope Hadrian VI the perpetual\r\nright to nominate prelates and abbots to vacant benefices. In 1543\r\nthe Spanish government further demanded and received the concession\r\nthat all posts within the church in Spain and her colonies should be\r\nheld by Spaniards. In 1538 the right of the church to issue bulls and\r\nbriefs affecting the colonies was limited. In 1574 Philip II declared\r\nthat the right of patronage belonged privately to the king. As a result\r\nof this, says Professor Altamira, \"the Spanish clergy considered itself\r\nmore closely bound to the king than to the pope, ... more dependent on\r\nthe court than on the curia, ... more eager for the privileges of the\r\ncrown than for the rights of the church, ... the bishops were obliged\r\nto obey the monarch more than the archbishop.\" (Altamira y Crevea,\r\nHistória, III, 418-19.)\r\n\r\nThe laws of the royal patronage centralized the supervision and control\r\nof the clergy of the Philippines in the person of the governor of the\r\nIslands. The latter was vicepatron and representative of the king in\r\necclesiastical matters. He was the responsible head of church affairs\r\nin the Islands so far as these matters concerned the government. He\r\nwas legally authorized and required to receive and assign prelates, to\r\nconfirm minor appointments by the prelates to parishes and curacies,\r\nto make removals from the same when necessary, to make temporary\r\nassignments of provinces to the regulars and to support the prelates in\r\nthe exercise of episcopal visitation. His consent was necessary to the\r\nsuppression, division, or union of districts, curacies and parishes,\r\nand no priest could leave the Islands without his consent. The\r\nking was patron, but the exercise of his authority in the colonies\r\nwas delegated to the respective viceroys and governors. See entire\r\ntitle of Recopilación, 1-6; for general observations on the royal\r\npatronage see Gómez Zamora, Regio patronato: Parrás, El gobierno de\r\nlos regulares de la América, I, 2-16; Mendieta, Historia eclesiástica,\r\n20-21, 186-196; Hernáez, Colección de bulas, 12-28.\r\n\r\n[692] This is a translation of ruego y encargo, which form civil\r\nofficials were required to employ on all occasions in addressing\r\necclesiastical officials. The king himself observed this rule and\r\nhis act was supposed to form a precedent for general use within the\r\nSpanish colonial empire.\r\n\r\n[693] Recopilación, 1-6-47.\r\n\r\n[694] Ibid., 2-1-10. Laws 11 and 12 of the same title did not in any\r\nway diminish the authority of the royal audiencia. Law 11, dated May\r\n16, 1571, antedating the one above quoted, declared that although\r\ncédulas on governmental subjects were occasionally addressed to the\r\n\"president and oidores,\" the viceroys and presidents might have\r\nprivate jurisdiction over these matters. Law 12, dated April 6,\r\n1638, recognized the fact that ministers of justice were frequently\r\naddressed on (governmental) subjects, which, it declared, should not\r\nbe construed to prejudice the viceroy's pre-eminence in these matters.\r\n\r\n[695] Concepción, as cited in note 1 of this chapter. Salazar's\r\narguments are outlined in Chapter II of this treatise.\r\n\r\n[696] Archbishop Pardo's well known opposition to the exercise of\r\ngovernmental control on the basis of the royal patronage and his\r\nresistance to the pretensions of ultimate superiority over the church\r\nwhich the temporal government claimed and assumed are referred to in\r\nanother part of this treatise. In a letter written by the archbishop\r\nrelative to the ecclesiastical controversy bearing his name, Pardo\r\nmade the assertion that no person was more zealous to encourage or\r\nconform to the royal authority than he, for he realized the necessity\r\nof complete temporal jurisdiction over all things secular. He stated\r\nthat he had always encouraged the ecclesiastics to comply with the\r\njust demands of the civil government, \"for it is just,\" he wrote to\r\nthe king, \"to observe the temporal things over which Your Majesty has\r\nprovidence, since the secular power must be obeyed, ... yet I cannot\r\noffend the royal person by allowing him or his servants to transgress\r\nthe rules or authority of God without interposing my influence against\r\nit, even at the risk of being disgraced; ... while I am allied to\r\nthe civil authority in things secular, I am the superior in spiritual\r\nmatters.\" He continued: \"God has placed side by side the ecclesiastical\r\nand temporal authorities and the latter were intended to be subject\r\nto the former, and therefore, the temporal ministers ought to cede to\r\nthe spiritual, according to the rules of the Holy Catholic Church. It\r\nis manifestly unjust, therefore, that a governor, maestre de campo,\r\nor other royal official should command or summon to justice a prelate\r\nwho is charged with the welfare of the souls of the people of his\r\ncommonwealth\" (Pardo to King, September 7, 1686, A. I., 68-1-44).\r\n\r\nA violent, though ineffective resistance was maintained by the church\r\nwhen Governor Simón de Anda y Salazar sought to abolish certain\r\npractices observed in the chanting of mass. Anda based his action\r\non his authority as vicepatron. In his stand he was supported by the\r\narchbishop and by two suffragan bishops. However, Bishop de Luna, of\r\nCamarines, who was also papal delegate, violently opposed \"sending\r\n[a copy of] this scandalous mandate to the royal Audiencia--a body\r\nconsisting of three magistrates, to whom an appeal may lie against the\r\ngovernor\" (Letter of a Franciscan Friar, December 13, 1771, Blair and\r\nRobertson, L, 318-319.) That a soldier should be the final arbiter in\r\na question belonging so pre-eminently to the ecclesiastical sphere,\r\nseemed to this bishop to be entirely subversive of the interests of\r\nreligion and he turned to the audiencia for protection and support. The\r\ngovernor sent a squad of soldiers to arrest the prelate, and the\r\nlatter was forced to leave the Islands.\r\n\r\nIn 1770, Governor Anda was vehemently opposed by the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities of the colony in his efforts, as the churchmen described\r\nit, \"to interfere in the governmental and judicial rights and\r\npre-eminences of the church.\" This was during the struggle over the\r\nquestion of episcopal visitation; in this matter the governor supported\r\nthe archbishop. The former had gone so far as to declare that the\r\nfriars had neither the right nor the authority to administer the\r\nsacraments. The replies of Fray Sebastián de Asunción, a Recollect,\r\nand of Antonio de San Próspero, of the Augustinians, attacked the\r\nwhole foundation of the royal patronage, claiming that the church\r\nshould be given entire control in ecclesiastical matters. According\r\nto their views the attention of the governor should be confined to\r\nadministrative affairs (Expediente de los provinciales de Filipinas, 15\r\nde Julio, 1772, A. I., 107-7-6). As these friars were the provincials\r\nof their orders, their opinions are of value in reflecting the\r\nideas of the religious in the Islands on the subject of episcopal\r\nvisitation. These opinions were contrary to the accepted practices\r\nand to the ideas of men of higher standing in Spain's colonial empire.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Pardo's well-known opposition to the exercise of\r\ngovernmental control on the basis of the royal patronage gave him\r\npre-eminence in these same matters.\r\n\r\n[697] Gómez Zamora, Regio patronato, 330 et seq.\r\n\r\n[698] Ibid., 330-354.\r\n\r\n[699] Ibid., 378.\r\n\r\n[700] Recopilación, 1-8-2, 3, 6. A dispute concerning the jurisdiction\r\nof the audiencia over the findings of synods arose in 1773 and again\r\nin 1776, when the Bishop of Nueva Segovia protested against the ruling\r\nof the audiencia that all the deliberations of a provincial synod\r\nwhich had been held in that bishopric should be submitted for its\r\napproval. The bishop appealed to the Council of the Indies and that\r\nbody approved the action of the audiencia (King to the Audiencia,\r\nOctober 19, 1776, A. I., 105-2-9).\r\n\r\n[701] Recopilación, 1-9-2, 7, 10.\r\n\r\n[702] Recopilación, 1-13-23.\r\n\r\n[703] Ibid., 1-14-1, 20, 42; 3-14-3.\r\n\r\n[704] Ibid., 1-14-34, 38.\r\n\r\n[705] Ibid., 44, 67.\r\n\r\n[706] This law was nullified by the cédula of August 1, 1795, which\r\nforbade the intervention of the vicepatron and audiencia in these\r\nmatters.

Illustrative of\r\nthis same authority on the part of the audiencia and the Council of the\r\nIndies was the consulta of the latter tribunal, enacted January 22,\r\n1781. The Audiencia of Manila had called the attention of the home\r\ngovernment to the fact that the nomination of Fray Manuel de Obelar,\r\na Dominican, to the post of apostolic vicar of the province of Fukien,\r\nChina, had been irregular because it had lacked the formality of\r\npresentation by the Spanish monarch. Other nominations, namely, those\r\nof 1753 and 1759, were cited as examples wherein this formality had\r\nnot been lacking. The Council of the Indies recommended to the King\r\nthat the nomination should be accepted and that an ayuda de costa\r\nshould be voted, but that His Holiness should be notified through the\r\nSpanish ambassador in Rome that in the future the requirements of the\r\nroyal patronage should be observed, and that no appointments in China,\r\nSpain, or in the Spanish colonies should be made without the consent\r\nof the Spanish monarch (A. I., 105-3-2).\r\n\r\n[715] Recopilación, 1-6-31 and 1-14-12, treat of the admission of\r\nforeign prelates and visitors to ecclesiastical posts within the\r\nSpanish colonial empire. The latter law stipulates, in addition,\r\nthat all bulls must be confirmed by the Council of the Indies before\r\ntheir introduction into the Indies.\r\n\r\n[716] Tourón proceeded to China, where he continued his inspection. He\r\nrevoked many of the privileges of the Spanish friars there and forced\r\ntheir retirement to Manila (consulta of the Council of the Indies on\r\nthe report of the proceedings of Cardinal Tourón in China, February\r\n24, 1710, A. I., 68-2-8). That his proceedings were recognized by\r\nthe Spanish government is shown by the consulta of April 21, 1708,\r\nwhereby 4000 pesos were voted to defray the expenses of Tourón in\r\nthe Philippines and China. This money was added to the Philippine\r\nsubsidy in Mexico (ibid.).\r\n\r\n[717] Arce to Philip III, July 30, 1619, Blair and Robertson, XVIII,\r\n238-239.\r\n\r\n[718] Díaz, Conquistas, II, 267, et seq.; Martínez de Zúñiga, An\r\nhistorical view, I, 259.\r\n\r\n[719] Tavora to Philip IV, July 8, 1632, Blair and Robertson, XXIV,\r\n224-228.\r\n\r\n[720] Corcuera to Philip IV, June 30, 1636, Blair and Robertson,\r\nXXVII, 21.\r\n\r\n[721] The cédula of December 15, 1797, authorized the installation of\r\nthe Bishop of Nueva Segovia as archbishop in the vacant see of Manila,\r\non the death of the incumbent, in accordance with the requirements\r\nof the royal patronage. On September 8, 1800, the Bishop of Cebú\r\nwas designated as archbishop in the same manner. The installations\r\nwere made by the vicepatron on the strength of these cédulas, with\r\nthe understanding that the latter were to be followed by the proper\r\npapal bulls, executed in due form.

The\r\nmethod of procedure in such cases may be illustrated by the efforts\r\nof the government to correct the abuses of Fray Alonso Zamudio, an\r\nAugustinian, who was in charge of a parish, and who therefore was\r\nsubject to episcopal visitation. He was charged with immoral and\r\nvicious conduct. The provincial of his order made an investigation\r\nand reported that the evidence brought against him would warrant his\r\nprosecution. He recommended the removal of the friar, which, he stated,\r\nhe could not himself bring about because Zamudio was acting as a parish\r\npriest. The provisor of the archbishopric recommended the banishment\r\nof Zamudio, which act was carried out by the governor in acuerdo with\r\nthe audiencia. A ruego y encargo was dispatched by the tribunal,\r\nsoliciting the surrender of the friar. He was accordingly handed\r\nover to the civil authorities and was incarcerated in Fort Santiago\r\nuntil the sentence could be executed (Información del juez-provisor,\r\ny testimonio de los abusos del fraile Alonso Zamudio, May 21, 1650,\r\nA. I., 67-6-9).\r\n\r\n[725] Recopilación, 1-14-71, 72. An illustration of the operation of\r\nthis sort of banishment may be noted in the case of three Augustinian\r\nfriars whose deportation was requested by their provincial. The request\r\nwas ignored by Governor Anda, whereupon the provincial wrote directly\r\nto the court; consequently on April 13, 1777, the king ordered the\r\naudiencia to see that these three friars were returned to Spain;\r\nAnda was advised to give more attention in the future to matters\r\npertaining to the royal patronage (King to the Audiencia, April 13,\r\n1777, A.

I., 105-2-6 bearing on\r\nsuits of natives and Chinese mestizos who aspired to enter the royal\r\nuniversity. In later years they were admitted, but these institutions\r\nwere primarily intended for the children of Spaniards. Of especial\r\ninterest was the suit brought in the audiencia by the Chinese mestizo,\r\nFrancisco de Borja, against the University of Santo Tomás for the\r\ndegree of master of arts, which the educational institution refused\r\nto grant on account of the nationality of the plaintiff. The suit\r\nwas carried to the Council of the Indies, and that tribunal, after\r\nrequiring the opinion of the royal fiscal, declared in its consulta\r\nof July 17, 1780, that the laws of the Indies (Recopilación, 1-22-57)\r\ndenied to mestizos, Chinese, and mulattoes the right of studying in\r\nthe royal universities, but once having qualified, however, there\r\nwas nothing in the origin or nature of an infidel that should prevent\r\nhis receiving his degree (A. I., 105-3-1). Another question which was\r\ndeliberated with much care was whether illegitimate children should\r\nbe admitted as students or qualified as licentiates.\r\n\r\n[761] Ecclesiastical tithes (diezmos), according to Martínez Alcubilla,\r\nwere \"taxes upon the products of the earth which the producers paid\r\nfrom the entire product of their labor, without deduction of the\r\nexpenses to which they were put, or consideration of the capital\r\ninvested\" (Martínez Alcubilla, Diccionario, V, 412). Escriche defines\r\nthe ecclesiastical tithe as \"the part which is paid by the faithful for\r\nthe maintenance of the ministers of the church,\" usually consisting\r\nof a tenth of their products, although at times it was less, varying\r\nwith the use and custom of the locality (Escriche, Diccionario,\r\nI, 638). This payment was required from merchants, farmers and\r\nencomenderos (Recopilación, 1-16-1 to 10). In 1537 Viceroy Mendoza was\r\ndirected to exact tithes from the natives (Bancroft, History of Mexico,\r\nIII, 666). This was again ordered by the cédulas of July 12, 1778,\r\nand January 20, 1786 (A. I., 105-2-9). Subsequently the agricultural\r\nestates of friars were made liable to the payment of tithes. As early\r\nas 1655 the Jesuits in New Spain were obliged to pay tithes on all\r\ncrops and productions of their estates (Bancroft, History of Mexico,\r\nIII, 668).\r\n\r\nThe purpose to which these funds were theoretically devoted was the\r\nsupport and maintenance of the church. The right of collecting and\r\nadministering them was conceded to the crown by Pope Alexander VI\r\nin the bull of November 16, 1501, in \"full, absolute and irrevocable\r\nownership, with the condition that the crown should assist the church\r\nwith a sum sufficient for the decent support of divine worship, its\r\nprelates and ministers\" (Recopilación, 1-16-1 and 23). The cédula\r\nof April 29, 1648 reaffirmed and amplified this bull, ordering in\r\naddition that one-third of all money arising from vacant benefices\r\nshould be set aside for the support of the church, while the residue\r\nshould be sent to Spain (ibid., 1-7-41; see also 1-16-28 and Article\r\n8, Real Ordenanza de Intendentes de Buenos Ayres; Robertson, History\r\nof America, IV [Bk. viii], note XXXII).\r\n\r\nOn February 3, 1541, Charles V prescribed that the tithes should be\r\ndivided into four equal parts, two of which were to go to the prelate\r\nand chapter of the diocese, while the remaining two parts were to\r\nbe further separated into ninths (novenos), of which two were to\r\nbe reserved for the crown, three for the construction of churches\r\nand hospitals, two for salaries of curates, and the remaining two\r\nportions were to be set aside to pay the dignitaries and subalterns\r\nof the diocese (Recopilación, 1-16-23).\r\n\r\nIn case the portion reserved for the salaries of curates proved\r\ninsufficient, the royal treasury guaranteed a yearly stipend of from\r\none hundred to a hundred and twenty pesos to each priest. This cédula\r\nwas amended by the regulation of March 28, 1620, which provided that\r\nthe royal ninths should be taken from the gross amount of tithes paid\r\nin (Recopilación, 1-16-25). So it developed that the crown came to\r\nassume entire jurisdiction over the administration of the tithes,\r\nretaining a portion of these episcopal rents for non-ecclesiastical\r\npurposes. The royal share was placed in the treasury and was\r\nadministered by the oficiales reales, leaving only seven-ninths of\r\nthe money actually obtained to be expended for the support of the\r\nchurch. These funds were collected in the provinces by the provincial\r\nrevenue officials, subject to the supervision of the alcaldes mayores,\r\nwho were responsible in turn for this particular matter to an oidor\r\nand a royal treasury official of the central government (Ibid.,\r\n1-16-1, 30).\r\n\r\nThese novenos were not infrequently farmed out in New Spain, and at the\r\nauctions thereof frauds were as repeatedly committed as at the sales\r\nof other royalties. Instructions were issued ordering the Audiencia\r\nof Mexico to investigate the nature of these transactions. In March,\r\n1728, the royal novenos were leased for a period of nine years at\r\n$19,000 annually. When this lease expired they were let again for\r\na similar period at $20,000 a year (Bancroft, History of Mexico,\r\nIII, 666-668 and note 57); see Priestley, José de Gálvez, 249-253,\r\nfor data on the administration of tithes in New Spain.\r\n\r\n[762] Recopilación, 1-16-11, 3.\r\n\r\n[763] Ibid., 13.\r\n\r\n[764] Ibid., 24; also Real Ordenanza de Intendentes de Nueva España,\r\nArt., 193.\r\n\r\n[765] Royal order of September 25, 1768, A.

While the laws of the Indies make no mention of the\r\nrequirement that the natives should pay tithes, the above cédulas\r\nexpressly order it. This is interesting, in view of the fact that\r\nGómez Zamora, in his Regio Patronato (381 et seq.) says that in the\r\nPhilippines the natives were not called upon for tithes. Montero y\r\nVidal (Historia general, III, 179) cites the cédula of May 23, 1801,\r\nwhich exempted Indians from the payment of tithes.\r\n\r\n[769] Montero y Vidal, Historia general, III, 179; also King to the\r\nAudiencia, October 6, 1792, A. I., 105-2-10.\r\n\r\n[770] Aguilar to Soler, July 31, 1799, A. I., 107-5-23.\r\n\r\n[771] On August 17, 1853, the superintendent of real hacienda of Manila\r\nmade an effort to revive the payment of tithes, which practice had\r\nbecome extinct. He ordered the religious provincials to present in\r\nthe administración general de tributos lists of all taxable property\r\nunder their jurisdiction (Montero y Vidal, Historia general, III, 178).\r\n\r\n[772] While the temporalities were originally the endowments of\r\nthe sovereign for the support of the clergy, in the Philippines at\r\nthis time they were chiefly derived from the sale of jewels, lands,\r\nlive-stock, and other chattel properties of the Jesuit order, which\r\nhad been suppressed in 1769. Property to the value of 2,000,000\r\npesos fell into the hands of the government on this occasion. The\r\ntemporalities did not include convents, school buildings, colleges,\r\nchurches and church furnishings. The latter were turned over to the\r\narchbishop and the secular church.\r\n\r\n[773] Cédula of January 22, 1803, A. I. 107-5-29.\r\n\r\n[774] A very instructive and hitherto unexplored field of investigation\r\nlies in the reports of the different officials and bodies in\r\nthe colonies which were entrusted with the duty of collecting and\r\nforwarding money to help Spain in putting down the various revolts of\r\nthe late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. We may note the\r\nletter of Governor Aguilar, dated July 20, 1804, in which he reported\r\ncompliance with the royal order of June 20, 1798, relative to the\r\nraising of money for the purposes indicated. He had opened two public\r\nsubscriptions for \"voluntary offerings\" to aid in putting down the\r\nCatalonian revolt of 1798. In the first subscription, 80,946 pesos\r\nwere raised and in the second, 15,397 pesos. The Dominicans alone\r\ngave 5000 pesos, the magistrates of the audiencia, the members of the\r\nconsulado, the contadores, oficiales, reales, obras pías, prelates,\r\ntemporalities, the Compañia de Filipinas, the monte pio militar,\r\nthe veteran soldiers, religious orders and other organizations and\r\nindividuals each contributing their share. Aguilar reported that\r\nsubscriptions had been opened in all the provinces by the corregidores,\r\nalcaldes mayores and intendentes. The various provinces and districts\r\ncontributed on this occasion as follows: Tondo, 11,059 pesos; Laguna,\r\n2768 pesos; Cebú, 300 pesos; Albay, 85 pesos; Cápiz, 318 pesos;\r\nLeyte, 21 pesos; Antique, 4 pesos; Samar, 1090 pesos; Zambales, 41\r\npesos; Calamianes, 1607 pesos; Mindoro, 221 pesos. This money was\r\nsent to the Viceroy of New Spain, and was forwarded to Spain by him\r\ntogether with the remittances collected for the same purposes in that\r\nviceroyalty. Reports of alcaldes mayores show that these assessments\r\n(contribuciones voluntarias or directas, or donativos voluntarios)\r\nvaried from half a real from the poorest Indian to five hundred\r\npesos from the wealthier landlords and merchants. In many cases these\r\nassessments practically amounted to confiscations (Aguilar to the King,\r\nJuly 20, 1804, A. I., 105-3-23).\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 1806, the king acknowledged receipt of money which had\r\nbeen confiscated from the common funds of the village communities\r\n(King to Aguilar, June 18, 1806, A. I., 105-2-18).\r\n\r\nHume, in his Modern Spain (158), says that in 1809 the colonies\r\ncontributed 3,000,000 pounds sterling for the relief of the home\r\ngovernment. Priestley, José de Gálvez, 370-71, sheds some light on\r\nthe matter of these forced contributions in New Spain.\r\n\r\n[775] Martínez Alcubilla, Diccionario, X, 719. The obras pías were\r\ncharitable associations or corporations, usually under ecclesiastical\r\ncontrol, which were founded and supported by persons who contributed\r\nor willed their money for beneficent objects. In Manila there were two\r\nleading societies of this character, the Santa Misericordia and San\r\nJuan de Diós. The former was a branch of a larger organization of the\r\nsame name, which had originated in Portugal, and was quite generally\r\nestablished throughout Spain, Portugal and their colonies. A branch was\r\nfounded in Manila in 1596, with the object, as stated in the articles\r\nof establishment, of erecting and maintaining a college for orphan\r\nchildren, the support of the poor, and particularly of the orphans and\r\nwidows of soldiers. This society flourished from the beginning under\r\nthe favor of certain governors and oidores and by their assistance and\r\nby that of other friends, and through the endowment by the government\r\nof a large amount of free space on the galleon, it became a wealthy\r\nand powerful institution. San Juan de Diós, which was organized as a\r\nbrotherhood, was established in the Philippines in 1617 with avowed\r\ncharitable purposes. In the cédula of February 10, 1617, the king\r\nordered the audiencia at Manila to place the hospitals under the care\r\nof this brotherhood (Blair and Robertson, XLVII, 164-165). Though it\r\ndid not attain the wealth or importance of the Misericordia and it\r\nnever had the extensive relations with the government of the other\r\nsociety, it did exceedingly valuable work in the Islands, going far\r\ntoward accomplishing the purposes for which it was founded.\r\n\r\n[776] By 1660, the Misericordia had received in contributions the\r\nsum of 356,363 pesos. In 1619, the treasury at Manila had become so\r\nexhausted by the expenses involved in resisting the Dutch that Governor\r\nFajardo borrowed from the society the sum of 39,599 pesos. Later\r\nGovernor Corcuera exacted a loan of 104,609 pesos. In all, up to 1670,\r\nan aggregate of 441,909 pesos had been borrowed from this wealthy\r\nsociety for the current expenses of the government. In 1762-3 the\r\nMisericordia contributed the sum of 195,588 pesos as tribute money\r\nto the British and was, according to its own accounts, despoiled of\r\n301,597 pesos, making a total of 506,184 pesos, and leaving a balance\r\nof 193,246 pesos (Procurador de la Misericordia de Manila al Rey,\r\n23 de Julio, 1764, A. I., 106-5-8).\r\n\r\nThe capital of the Misericordia of Manila on January 31, 1755,\r\nwas estimated at 701,477 pesos (Informe del Contador de Cuentas,\r\n31 de Enero, 1755, A. I., 106-5-8). In the occupation of Manila by\r\nthe British and in the loss and despoliation of property suffered\r\nthereby, the Misericordia received a blow from which it never entirely\r\nrecovered. By July 20, 1804, the capital of the society had dwindled\r\nto 151,625 pesos (Aguilar to the King, July 20, 1804, A. I., 107-5-29).\r\n\r\n[777] Cédula of November 8, 1747, with testimonios of previous\r\ncorrespondence, A.

I.,\r\n105-2-9.\r\n\r\n[787] The term espolio was applied to the properties which archbishops\r\nand bishops left at the time of their death, such property having\r\naccumulated when they were in office. All possessions of deceased\r\nprelates reverted to the crown in accordance with the cédula of March\r\n25, 1620. The rents from vacant benefices accumulated from the time\r\nof the death of a prelate to the appointment of another to succeed\r\nhim (Escriche, Diccionario, I, 735; Bancroft, History of Mexico,\r\nIII, 699). The money derived from espolios and vacant benefices was\r\naggregated to the royal treasury for such subsequent distribution as\r\nappeared necessary for the relief of cathedrals, parishes, colleges,\r\nasylums, and charitable institutions.\r\n\r\n[788] Recopilación, 1-7-38, 39.\r\n\r\n[789] Ibid., 37, 40.\r\n\r\n[790] Cédula of June 24, 1712, A.

I., 68-4-18.\r\n\r\n[792] In the colonial bishoprics the temporary successor of a deceased\r\nprelate was usually designated by the local diocesan chapter. If,\r\nas was the case in the Philippines, the latter body were lacking, the\r\narchbishop, by virtue of his position, became temporary ecclesiastical\r\ngovernor, with jurisdiction over the revenues of the diocese. The\r\nbenefice was considered vacant until the appointment of a regular\r\nbishop.\r\n\r\n[793] A fairly typical example of an espolio was that of Bishop Arévalo\r\nof Nueva Cáceres, rendered by the audiencia on July 19, 1759. The total\r\nsum left by that prelate was 19,000 pesos. The leading items of the\r\nespolio were: costs, 1919 pesos; bequest to College of Santo Tomás,\r\n2000 pesos; bequest to the cathedral of Nueva Cáceres, 400 pesos;\r\nbequest to the brother of the deceased, the Marquis of Monte Castro,\r\n1000 pesos. The remaining portion was paid to creditors in sums\r\nvarying from 20 to 300 pesos, leaving something over 6000 pesos for\r\nthe crown (Auto de Espolio, 20 de Julio, 1759, Audiencia de Manila,\r\nA. I., 106-4-16).\r\n\r\nOn June 14, 1774, the audiencia reviewed the autos of espolio of\r\nthe Bishop of Cebú, the total of which aggregated 11,210 pesos. The\r\npapers were duly forwarded to the Contaduría General, at Madrid,\r\nand were approved by that tribunal on June 20, 1778 (A. I., 105-2-9).\r\n\r\nOwing to the anarchical conditions prevailing at the time of the\r\ndeath of Archbishop Rojo, his espolio had to be postponed until June\r\n26, 1777, and the royal treasury received 3078 pesos therefrom. The\r\nprelate left a valuable library to the College of San Ildefonso in\r\nthe city of Mexico, and 13,617 pesos in money to be distributed among\r\nhis personal creditors and heirs (Consultas del Consejo, 20 de Marzo,\r\n1778, A. I., 108-7-1 and 2; 105-3-2).\r\n\r\nThe large sum of 12,000 pesos was netted to the royal treasury\r\nby the espolio of Bishop Espeleta of Cebú on May 6, 1783 (A. I.,\r\n105-2-10). By way of contrast, the fact may be noted that the espolio\r\nof Archbishop Santos y Rufina yielded 92 pesos. (Auto de Espolio del\r\nArzobispo Santos y Rufina, 20 de Octubre, 1792, A.

P. Cushing, in Blair and Robertson, V,\r\n292. Escriche (Diccionario, I, 838-9) defines fuerza as \"the wrong\r\nwhich an ecclesiastical judge does to a party when he assumes\r\njurisdiction over a case which does not belong to him, or when\r\nhe fails to observe the rules prescribed by the laws and canons,\r\nor when he unjustly denies appeal.\" Recurso de fuerza is defined as\r\nthe reclamation to a civil judge, made by a person believing himself\r\naggrieved by an ecclesiastical judge, imploring the protection of\r\nthe former in order that the fuerza or violence may be terminated\r\nor undone. There are three ways mentioned by Alcubilla in which an\r\necclesiastical judge may commit fuerza: 1. When he assumes jurisdiction\r\nin a purely temporal case, which by its very nature is not rightfully\r\nsubject to his authority. 2. When, by trying a case whose jurisdiction\r\nbelongs to him, he fails to observe the method and form prescribed\r\nby the laws and canons. 3. When he refuses to allow appeals which\r\nshould be rightfully allowed (Martínez Alcubilla, Diccionario, V, 807).\r\n\r\n[807] Recopilación, 2-15-148, 149. The interdict, as defined\r\nby Escriche (Diccionario, I, 712), is a prohibition, mandate,\r\nor censure, pronounced by an ecclesiastical authority by which is\r\nprohibited the use of certain spiritual privileges which are common\r\nto all. The effect of the interdict may be to prohibit Christian\r\nburial, the administration of the sacraments or the celebration of\r\ndivine services. Exception may be made in rare cases of baptisms,\r\nconfirmation and confession for the dying. Even though the interdict\r\nmay be pronounced it does not prohibit the saying of mass in a\r\nlow voice behind closed doors and without the ringing of bells. A\r\npriest who violates the interdict may be pronounced \"irregular\",\r\nbut a layman who does so may incur the penalty of excommunication\r\n(see Catholic Encyclopedia, under \"Interdict\").\r\n\r\n[808] This refers to the privilege extended by the church to offenders\r\nagainst the laws of the realm, who were allowed to take refuge from\r\nthe civil authorities in a church or convent. This practice was\r\nrecognized by the government. By a bull of Clement XIV, the right of\r\nextending asylum was limited to a few churches only, the number of\r\nthese depending on the population of the town or city. Those guilty\r\nof certain specified crimes of the most heinous character were\r\ndenied the privilege of sanctuary. The act of sheltering oneself\r\nunder the protection of God was supposed to be spontaneous and not\r\npremeditated. The privilege was often abused by individual churchmen\r\n(Escriche, Diccionario, I, 353).\r\n\r\n[809] A clarifying description of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction\r\nhas been given by Escriche. He defines it as \"the power of the\r\nChurch for the trial and adjudication of civil and criminal affairs\r\nexercised either by its own right or by concession of princes.\" This\r\njurisdiction, says Escriche, is of two kinds, inherent (spiritual)\r\nand privileged (temporal). After classifying the different cases which\r\nfall naturally under each category, he describes the tribunals for\r\nthe interpretation of canon law. \"The ecclesiastical jurisdiction,\"\r\nhe writes, \"the inherent, as well as the privileged, is exercised,\r\nin first instance, by the bishops and archbishops in their respective\r\ndioceses, in the second, by the metropolitan with respect to the\r\nsuffragans, and in the third, by the papal delegate. The bishops\r\nand archbishops do not exercise the jurisdiction by themselves\r\nbut by means of their provisores or vicarios. These latter may be\r\neither generales or foráneos.... The term provisor or vicar-general\r\nis used to designate him who exercises the ordinary ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction in the entire territory of the diocese and resides in\r\nthe episcopal city situated therein; ... foráneos are the others\r\nestablished as delegates in certain parts of the diocese in order to\r\nfacilitate the administration of justice; no appointments to these\r\noffices may be made without the royal approbation. The authority\r\nof the provisores and vicarios cease by death of the prelate from\r\nwhom they obtained the nomination, and is reassumed by the cabildo\r\nor chapter, sede vacante, which selects persons to succeed them\"\r\n(Escriche, Diccionario, II, 453).\r\n\r\nEscriche further describes this hierarchy of ecclesiastical judges:\r\n\"The metropolitans, then, are the ordinary judges of first instance\r\nwith regard to the archbishoprics and at the same time they are\r\nthe judges of appeal from the suffragans, and, accordingly, they\r\nare accustomed to appoint, aside from the provisores or vicarios,\r\nordinarios who discharge the functions of judges of first instance. As\r\nthe obispos exentos are not subject to a metropolitan, but directly\r\nto the holy see, recourses of appeals from their decisions go to the\r\npapal delegate.\" The cases of appeal from the metropolitans and other\r\necclesiastical judges were heard in third and last instance by the\r\ntribunal known as the rota of the papal delegate, which was composed\r\nof the nuncio of the pope, and the ecclesiastical auditors appointed\r\nby the crown.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical courts of the Philippines conformed generally, in\r\norganization and limits of jurisdiction, to the scheme outlined in the\r\npreceding paragraphs. The three bishops of Nueva Segovia, Camarines,\r\nand Cebú had their courts in the chief towns of their respective\r\ndioceses. They were assisted by the customary provisores. Appeals\r\nwere carried from them to the court of the metropolitan which was\r\nlocated in Manila; this latter tribunal consisted of the archbishop,\r\nthe vicar-general, and a notary. Above this court was that of the\r\npapal delegate who tried cases of appeal from the lower tribunal in\r\naccordance with canon law. In conformity with a bull of Gregory XIII,\r\ndated May 15, 1572, the authority of the papal delegate in appeal cases\r\nwas final; \"he might overrule and even supersede the metropolitan,\r\nas being the judge in final appeal.\" The Bishop of Camarines most\r\nfrequently acted as papal delegate (Blair and Robertson, XLII, 27,\r\nNote 4). Aside from these courts there was that of the commissary of\r\nthe Inquisition whose jurisdiction will be subsequently noted.\r\n\r\nEach order, also, had its own judicial machinery for the settlement\r\nof cases arising within it. The courts of the orders were presided\r\nover by their provincials, generals and commissaries, and were\r\ncomposed of those dignitaries and other magistrates selected in\r\naccordance with their own rules. Special investigators or visitors\r\nwere also delegated to try cases arising within the orders, and to\r\nmake inspections, ascertaining the general character of the work of\r\nthe orders, the conduct of their dignitaries and the regularity of\r\ntheir administration.\r\n\r\n[810] Moses, South America on the eve of emancipation, 126.\r\n\r\n[811] Carta de Fr.

This was in\r\n1581, before the audiencia was established. The offending encomenderos\r\nwere brought to Manila and tried by Bishop Salazar, who temporarily\r\ndeprived them of their holdings and sentenced them to imprisonment and\r\nfines (Governor to the King [day and month not given], A. I., 67-6-6).\r\n\r\n[819] The opposition of Salazar to what he termed the encroachment\r\nof the civil jurisdiction was based on the assumption that the royal\r\npatronage did not extend to tribes which lived in an uncivilized\r\nand savage state. He contended that the pope had not conceded\r\nthis, consequently, as bishop, he had entire jurisdiction without\r\ninterference from the audiencia or governor over the Mohammedans\r\n(as he termed all non-Christians) and the Chinese (A. I., 1-1-3/25).\r\n\r\n[820] Cabildo de Manila to the King, A. I, 68-1-35.\r\n\r\n[821] Fajardo to Felipe III, August 15, 1620, Blair and Robertson,\r\nXIX, 155. The pendulum seems, however, to have swung in the other\r\ndirection at times. In 1604, the audiencia was charged with having\r\ntried members of religious orders in absentia without giving them a\r\nchance to summon witnesses or otherwise to defend themselves (King\r\nto Audiencia, October 30, 1604, A. I., 105-2-1). That the audiencia\r\ndid not always have power to discipline the friars for infractions of\r\nthe royal laws in 1626, is attested by the case of an Augustinian who\r\nled an assault on an alcalde mayor in Batangas, destroyed his house,\r\nmaltreated his person, and, in the presence of the natives, publicly\r\naccomplished his disgrace. The king demanded from the audiencia a\r\nstatement of all the facts of the case so that he and the Council\r\nmight take proper steps for the punishment of the offending religious\r\nand the protection of His Majesty's servants in the future (King to\r\nAudiencia, May 21, 1623, A. I., 105-2-1). The audiencia conducted an\r\ninvestigation and forwarded the papers relative to the case to the\r\ncourt for final action.

The commissary of the Inquisition had\r\nfor his special field all questions of faith and heresy, clearing\r\naway the errors and superstitions against the dogma and the lax\r\nopinions which pervert Christian morals (Pérez y López, Teatro,\r\nXXVIII, 208). The Inquisitor of the Philippines was instructed,\r\non his arrival, to present his papers \"to the ecclesiastical and\r\nlay chapters in order that they might receive him and recognize\r\nhim in so high and holy an office.\" The Inquisition was represented\r\ncontinuously in the Philippines until 1813. With the introduction\r\nof this dignitary may be noted the presence in the Philippines of\r\nat least five authorities with ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The\r\nordinary ecclesiastical tribunals dealt with contentions within\r\nthe Church. The papal delegate tried cases which had been appealed\r\nfrom these ecclesiastical courts. The regular orders had their own\r\nparticular tribunals for the rule and discipline of their members\r\nand the audiencia exercised such ecclesiastical jurisdiction as we\r\nhave noted in this chapter. There may be slight wonder, therefore,\r\nin view of the presence of so many ecclesiastical tribunals with\r\nsimilar powers, that there were frequent conflicts of authority.\r\n\r\n[851] Recopilación, 1-19-1.\r\n\r\n[852] Law of May 22, 1610, Recopilación, 1-19-2.\r\n\r\n[853] The authorized proceeding in such a case was to appeal to\r\nthe General Council of the Inquisition, which held its sessions at\r\nthe court. This tribunal was authorized to nullify or reverse any\r\nharmful act or decision which the ordinary inquisitors might resolve\r\nupon. (Cédula of March 10, 1553, Recopilación, 1-19-4).\r\n\r\n[854] Recopilación, 1-19-18, 19.\r\n\r\n[855] Ibid., 16.\r\n\r\n[856] Ibid., 21 and 22.\r\n\r\n[857] Ibid., 3-15-78.\r\n\r\n[858] \"When a case may be tried indistinctly either by an\r\necclesiastical or lay judge it is said that the case is of the\r\nfuero mixto and then either of the two judges may take up the case,\r\nbut the judge who begins it must be the last to try it\" (Escriche,\r\nDiccionario, I, 832-833).\r\n\r\n[859] See note to Recopilación, 1-19-4.\r\n\r\n[860] Le Gentil, II, 172. Recopilación, 6-1-35.\r\n\r\n[861] Audiencia to the King, July 20, 1585, A. I., 67-6-18. On\r\nJune 26, 1586, the audiencia recommended the discontinuance of\r\nthe Inquisition in the Philippines on the ground that it had\r\nbeen utilized \"as a citadel for the shelter of those desirous\r\nof resisting the royal authority\" (Audiencia to the King, A. I.,\r\n68-1-33). Archbishop Santibañez, on the other hand, was desirous of\r\nconverting the inquisitorial authority into a tribunal to consist\r\nof two ecclesiastics and one oidor. He argued that the distance from\r\nMexico made procedure cumbersome, and it was manifestly unjust that\r\nresidents of the Philippines should be judged by a foreign court\r\n(referring to the tribunal in Mexico.--Santibañez to Philip II,\r\nJune 24, 1598, Blair and Robertson, X, 151). These same sentiments\r\nwere expressed sixty years later by Francisco Bello, procurator at\r\nMadrid for the religious orders. The Council of the Indies returned\r\nthe petition which had been submitted by this last-named ecclesiastic,\r\nto the Viceroy of New Spain, and to the Audiencia and Archbishop of\r\nManila, respectively, for their advice. The consensus of opinion\r\nwas against the idea of creating a tribunal in Manila, partially\r\non account of the expense. It was also shown that such a reform\r\nwould have meant a loss of power to the viceroyalty of New Spain,\r\nand by the adoption of such a suggestion there would be created a\r\npowerful tribunal which would seriously inconvenience the authority\r\nand supremacy of the audiencia and the archbishop at Manila (Consulta\r\nof the Council of the Indies, March 15, 1659, A. I., 67-6-22).\r\n\r\n[862] Cited already in various connections, particularly in Chapters\r\nII and X of this treatise.\r\n\r\n[863] In the Philippines, archbishops were frequently able to combine\r\nthe functions and offices of metropolitan prelate and commissary of\r\nthe Inquisition. This gave greater pre-eminence to the archbishop and\r\nmade the situation more difficult for the civil authorities. We have\r\nalready noted an illustration of this in the case of Archbishop Pardo\r\n(1683-1689). Being also commissary of the Inquisition, he refused to\r\ngrant absolution to ex-Governor Vargas, claiming that his authority\r\nas sole inquisitor was not sufficient to justify such action on his\r\npart without first receiving advice from the tribunal in Mexico.\r\n\r\n[864] Lea, in his well-known work on The inquisition in the Spanish\r\ndependencies says that \"while this branch of the Inquisition (referring\r\nto that in the Philippines) accomplished so little for the faith,\r\nit was eminently successful in the function of contributing to\r\nthe disorder and confusion which so disastrously affected Spanish\r\ncolonial administration\" (p. 308). For a more detailed account of\r\nthis episode see Cunningham, \"The inquisition in the Philippines:\r\nthe Salcedo affair,\" in The Catholic historical review, III, 417-445.\r\n\r\n[865] The leading church historians of the Philippines--Martínez de\r\nZúñiga, Salazar, Fonseca and Concepción--were naturally unfavorable\r\nto Salcedo in their accounts of the events of his administration. All\r\nagree, however, that Salcedo was a man of energy and precision, who, at\r\nthe beginning of his rule, gave promise of universal satisfaction. The\r\ncorrespondence of the civil officials who were contemporaneous with\r\nthe governor, and the letters of Salcedo himself show that his chief\r\nconcern was the enforcement of the laws and the elimination of the\r\necclesiastical and commercial graft with which the administration of\r\nthe government of the Philippines was permeated on his arrival in\r\nthe Islands (Letters of Coloma, Bónifaz, Montemayor, León, and the\r\nMunicipal Cabildo, 1670-1, A. I., 67-6-3; see also note to Ventura\r\ndel Arco Mss., in Blair and Robertson, XXXVII, 262).\r\n\r\nZúñiga, however, states that Salcedo's commercial reforms were\r\nonly intended for the benefit of himself and his friends, and that\r\nhe reserved the chief articles of trade for himself, leaving only\r\nsecond-rate and spoiled goods for the merchants. This same historian\r\nstates that the governor arranged for the early departure of the\r\ngalleon on one occasion, with his goods on board, leaving those\r\nof the majority of the merchants unshipped (Martínez de Zúñiga,\r\nAn historical view, I, 307-308). Fonseca charges him with avarice,\r\nmaintaining that all classes of society in Manila were disgusted\r\nwith the governor's commercial transactions and were shocked at his\r\nexile of the archbishop. This historian relates that \"the magistracy,\r\nthe army, the merchants, arts and industries, ... all raised their\r\nvoices against the badly directed government of Salcedo, determining\r\nto over-turn him; representative citizens of Manila petitioned the\r\naudiencia, asking that it deprive him of the government, ... and the\r\nroyal acuerdo determined to do so, but at the last moment the judges\r\ndisagreed over the question of whose signature should precede the\r\nothers; this question remained in litigation, and blocked the action\r\nof the royal acuerdo\" (Fonseca, Historia de la provincia de santissimo\r\nRosario. Libro V, Capítulo VIII, quoted in Sobre una reseña histórica,\r\n92). Concepción, the Augustinian historian, confirms the above, and\r\ngives a more clarifying reason for the failure of the audiencia to\r\noust the governor--namely, that the latter was sharing his commercial\r\nprofits with the magistrates, thereby purchasing their favors; the\r\noidores were therefore reluctant to take action against the governor\r\n(Concepción, Historia general, VII, 137-138, 162-200).\r\n\r\n[866] Salcedo was charged with plotting to sell the Islands to the\r\nDutch and with surrounding himself with Flemings, one of whom was a\r\nCalvinist. It was alleged that he had already sent large sums of money\r\nto Macao, including a large part of the funds in the Manila treasury,\r\nand that he was preparing to depart in person. It was said moreover\r\nthat he intended to return in command of a Dutch squadron and capture\r\nthe colony for Holland. It is evident that there was no lack of charges\r\nagainst Salcedo (The original correspondence and consultas of the\r\nvarious tribunals which considered the charges against Salcedo may\r\nbe noted in A. I., 67-6-3. See Blair and Robertson, XXXVII, 37-60,\r\nLea, The inquisition in the Spanish dependencies, 299-318, and the\r\necclesiastical authorities mentioned in the preceding note).\r\n\r\nDr. Pardo de Tavera, in his account of the arrest of Governor Salcedo,\r\nsays that \"in 1668, Governor Salcedo had some difference with (the\r\nfriars) ... and the archbishop and as a result, the latter decided to\r\navenge themselves, plotting with the military officials, regidores and\r\nmerchants to bring him before the Inquisition. They made a conspiracy\r\nand, one night while the governor slept, the conspirators, among\r\nwhom were the provincial of the Franciscans, the guardián of the\r\nconvent of that order in Manila, and various other ecclesiastics,\r\nentered his room, surprising him while he slept, and placed him in\r\nirons. He was thus taken to the convent of the Franciscans, but\r\nconsidering the latter insecure, they carried him to that of San\r\nAugustín, loading him with a heavy chain\" (Pardo de Tavera, Reseña\r\nHistórica, 37). After a period of imprisonment in Manila, Salcedo\r\nwas ordered to Mexico for trial by the tribunal of the Inquisition,\r\nas the local authority was without authority to take further action\r\nin the matter. Salcedo never reached his destination, however,\r\nas he died at sea. This was subsequently the fate of Paternina,\r\nthe inquisitor who was responsible for his disgrace.\r\n\r\n[867] That Governor León had a trying position to fill may be\r\nbelieved by his description of affairs as he found them in Manila,\r\nand of his struggles to restore the royal authority to its proper\r\nstatus. He gave a full account of \"the excessive presumption of the\r\ncommissary of the Inquisition in the arrest of Don Diego Salcedo,\r\nmy (his) predecessor, and his interference in matters wherein he had\r\nno real jurisdiction.\" León reported having prevailed upon the royal\r\naudiencia to order the commissary to refrain from meddling in affairs\r\nwhich did not concern the Inquisition. The ways of the Inquisition he\r\ndescribed as \"dark and secret;\" it was \"a danger and a fearful power,\"\r\na \"monster, feared by all,\" working, not in the light of day, but\r\ninsidiously, constituting a sinister power whose strength was not\r\nfully realized (León to Council, June 10, 1671, and July 4, 1672;\r\nConsulta of the Council of the Indies, July 16, 1674, A. I., 67-6-3).\r\n\r\n[868] Audiencia to the King, June 15, 1671, A. I., 67-6-10.\r\n\r\n[869] Consulta of the Council, August 12, 1672, A.

I., 67-6-10.\r\n\r\n[872] While the Salcedo affair accurately depicts the power which the\r\nInquisition assumed on a particular occasion, the episode cannot be\r\nsaid to illustrate its power and influence throughout the history of\r\nthe Islands. Indeed, never on any former or subsequent occasion did the\r\nInquisition constitute such a menace to the state. It was generally\r\nprevented from exercising too much power in the Philippines by its\r\nown isolation. Represented by a single agent, who was not always on\r\ngood terms with the other ecclesiastical authorities there, and who\r\nwas thousands of miles from his immediate superior, the tribunal of\r\nMexico, he was confronted and opposed by the combined civil, secular\r\nand monastic powers. Owing to these circumstances, the commissary\r\nof the Inquisition in the Philippines could not, single-handed and\r\nunaided, constitute a long-continued danger to the commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[873] Reales resoluciones no recopiladas, Pérez y López, Teatro,\r\nXXVIII, 207.\r\n\r\n[874] Recopilación, 1-19, note 2.\r\n\r\n[875] Ibid., note 1. This tendency culminated in the decree of February\r\n22, 1813, which suppressed the Supreme Tribunal of the Inquisition and\r\nrenewed the jurisdiction of bishops and vicars over cases involving\r\nthe faith, as had been the practice before the Inquisition was\r\ninstituted. All property belonging to the Inquisition reverted to the\r\ncrown. Soon after the restoration of Ferdinand VII the Inquisition\r\nwas revived, against the will of that monarch, it is said, but it\r\nwas again abolished by the decrees of March 9, 1820, and July 1, 1835.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the suppression of the Tribunal of the Inquisition\r\non March 9, 1820, and the transfer of its authority over matters of\r\nfaith to the vicars and bishops, Escriche says that \"in the exercise\r\nof their jurisdiction some of these prelates exceeded their authority\r\nand established in their respective dioceses juntas de fé, which turned\r\nout to be in reality inquisitorial tribunals with practically the same\r\nauthority which former tribunals had exercised. They inflicted corporal\r\nand spiritual punishments and guarded in their ministry the most\r\ninviolable secrecy.\" As soon as reports of this unexpected assumption\r\nof authority came to the notice of the government, Ferdinand hastened\r\nto order the suppression of these self-constituted tribunals, without\r\nimmediate success, however. Escriche tells us that they continued\r\ntheir excesses for some time, \"depriving accused persons of the\r\nmeans of defense, keeping from them the names of persons testifying\r\nagainst them,\" flagrantly disregarding the dispositions of the brief\r\nof Pius VII, dated October 5, 1829, in prohibition of exactly these\r\nabuses. On February 6, 1830, a cédula was expedited which authorized\r\nappeals in cases of this nature until three conforming decisions were\r\nrendered. The decree of July 1, 1835, abolished these tribunals,\r\nordering the prelates to exercise jurisdiction with appeal to the\r\nDepartment of Grace and Justice (Escriche, Diccionario, I, 773).\r\n\r\n[876] The author has treated this subject in a separate monograph\r\nentitled \"The origin of the friar lands question in the Philippines,\"\r\nin The American political science review, X, 463-480.\r\n\r\n[877] The friar lands litigation began in 1687 and continued\r\nuntil 1751. The efforts of the government met with considerable\r\nopposition. The oidores who were charged with the inspection of the\r\ntitles to these lands frequently abandoned their commissions and\r\nrecommended that the friars be left alone. However, in the year last\r\nmentioned, the opposition of the Franciscans, the last of the resisting\r\norders, was overcome (Correspondence regarding friar lands exists in\r\nA. I., 68-4-12 and 68-6-26).

According to the canon law they were\r\nnot able to hold beneficed curacies, but the extent of the American\r\nfield, and the limited number of the clergy available to occupy it,\r\ninduced Leo X, Adrian VI, Paul III, Clement VIII, and Pius V to permit\r\nthem to become parish priests. Under this order a very large number\r\nof these parishes in America in the first century were occupied by\r\nfriars. But in the middle of the eighteenth century, this privilege\r\nwas withdrawn, leaving them only two friars in a conventual province\"\r\n(Moses, South America on the eve of emancipation, 138-139).\r\n\r\n[879] See Cunningham, \"The question of ecclesiastical visitation in\r\nthe Philippines,\" in The Pacific Ocean in history, 223-237.\r\n\r\n[880] Recopilación, 1-15-28.\r\n\r\n[881] Ibid., 29.\r\n\r\n[882] Ibid., 31.\r\n\r\n[883] Valuable materials, for the most part original, on the visitation\r\ncontroversy may be found in Blair and Robertson, XXIV, 247; XXIX,\r\n191; XLII, 25-116; XX, 87; XXI, 32-78; XXXVII, 193-200.
