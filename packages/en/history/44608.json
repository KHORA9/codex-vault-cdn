O Source of power to Be!\r\n   Each line, each thought I dedicate to Thee;\r\n   Each time I fail, the failure is my own,\r\n   But each success, a jewel in Thy Throne.\r\n\r\n   JESSIE E. CADELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nThis book is a translation of Babur Padshah's Autobiography, made from\r\nthe original Turki text. It was undertaken after a purely-Turki\r\nmanuscript had become accessible in England, the Haidarabad Codex (1915)\r\nwhich, being in Babur's _ipsissima verba_, left to him the control of\r\nhis translator's diction—a control that had been impracticable from the\r\ntime when, under Akbar (1589), his book was translated into Persian.\r\nWhat has come down to us of pure text is, in its shrunken amount, what\r\nwas translated in 1589. It is difficult, here and there, to interpret\r\nowing to its numerous and in some places extensive _lacunae_, and\r\npresents more problems than one the solution of which has real\r\nimportance because they have favoured suggestions of malfeasance by\r\nBabur.\r\n\r\nMy translation has been produced under considerable drawback, having\r\nbeen issued in four _fasciculi_, at long intervals, respectively in June\r\n1912, May 1914, October 1917, and September 1921. I have put with it of\r\nsupplementary matter what may be of service to those readers whom\r\nBabur's personality attracts and to those who study Turki as a\r\nlinguistic entertainment, but owing to delays in production am unable to\r\ninclude the _desiderata_ of maps.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nBABUR'S EXEMPLARS IN THE ARTS OF PEACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBabur's civilian aptitudes, whether of the author and penman, the maker\r\nof gardens, the artist, craftsman or sportsman, were nourished in a\r\nfertile soil of family tradition and example. Little about his teaching\r\nand training is now with his mutilated book, little indeed of any kind\r\nabout his præ-accession years, not the date of his birth even, having\r\nescaped destruction.[4] Happily Haidar Mirza (_q.v._) possessed a more\r\ncomplete Codex than has come down to us through the Timurid libraries,\r\nand from it he translated many episodes of Baburiana that help to bridge\r\ngaps and are of special service here where the personalities of Bābur's\r\nearly environment are being named.\r\n\r\nBabur's home-milieu favoured excellence in the quiet Arts and set before\r\nits children high standard and example of proficiency. Moreover, by\r\nschooling him in obedience to the Law, it planted in him some of Art's\r\nessentials, self-restraint and close attention. Amongst primal\r\ninfluences on him, his mother Qut-luq-nigar's ranked high; she,\r\nwell-born and a scholar's daughter, would certainly be educated in Turki\r\nand Persian and in the home-accomplishments her governess possessed\r\n_(ātūn_ q.v.). From her and her mother Aisan-daulat, the child would\r\nlearn respect for the attainments of his wise old grandfather Yunas\r\nKhan. Aisan-daulat herself brought to her grandson much that goes to the\r\nmaking of a man; nomad-born and sternly-bred, she was brave to obey her\r\nopinion of right, and was practically the boy's ruling counsellor\r\nthrough his early struggle to hold Farghana. With these two in fine\r\ninfluence must be counted Khan-zada, his five-years elder sister who\r\nfrom his birth to his death proved her devotion to him. Her life-story\r\ntempts, but is too long to tell; her girlish promise is seen fulfilled\r\nin Gul-badan's pages. `Umar Shaikh's own mother Shah Sultan Begim\r\nbrought in a type of merit widely differing from that of Aisan-daulat\r\nBegim; as a town-lady of high Tarkhan birth, used to the amenities of\r\nlife in a wealthy house of Samarkand, she was, doubtless, an\r\naccomplished and cultured woman.\r\n\r\n`Umar Shaikh's environment was dominated for many years by two great\r\nmen, the scholar and lover of town-life Yunas Khan and the saintly\r\nAhrari (_i.e._ Khwaja `Ubaidu'l-lah) who were frequently with him in\r\ncompany, came at Babur's birth and assisted at his naming. Ahrari died\r\nin 895-1491 when the child was about seven years old but his influence\r\nwas life-long; in 935-1529 he was invoked as a spiritual helper by the\r\nfever-stricken Babur and his mediation believed efficacious for recovery\r\n(pp. 619, 648). For the babe or boy to be where the three friends held\r\nsocial session in high converse, would be thought to draw blessing on\r\nhim; his hushed silence in the presence would sow the seed of reverence\r\nfor wisdom and virtue, such, for example, as he felt for Jami (_q.v._).\r\nIt is worth while to tell some part at least of Yunas' attainments in\r\nthe gentler Arts, because the biography from which they are quoted may\r\nwell have been written on the information of his wife Aisan-daulat, and\r\nit indicates the breadth of his exemplary influence. Yunas was many\r\nthings—penman, painter, singer, instrumentalist, and a past master in\r\nthe crafts. He was an expert in good companionship, having even temper\r\nand perfect manners, quick perception and conversational charm. His\r\nintellectual distinction was attributed to his twelve years of wardship\r\nunder the learned and highly honoured Yazdi (Sharafu'd-din 'Ali), the\r\nauthor of the _Zafar-nama_ [Timur's Book of Victory]. That book was in\r\nhand during four years of Yunas' education; he will thus have known it\r\nand its main basis Timur's Turki _Malfūzāt_ (annals). What he learned of\r\neither book he would carry with him into `Umar Shaikh's environment,\r\nthus magnifying the family stock of Timuriya influence. He lived to be\r\nsome 74 years old, a length of days which fairly bridged the gap between\r\nTimur's death [807-1404] and Babur's birth (888-1483). It is said that\r\nno previous Khan of his (Chaghatai) line had survived his 40th year; his\r\nexceptional age earned him great respect and would deepen his influence\r\non his restless young son-in-law `Umar Shaikh. It appears to have been\r\nin `Umar's 20th year (_cir._) that Yunas Khan began the friendly\r\nassociation with him that lasted till Yunas' death (892-1483), a\r\nfriendship which, as disparate ages would dictate, was rather that of\r\nfather and son than of equal companionship. One matter mentioned in the\r\nKhan's biography would come to Babur's remembrance in the future days\r\nwhen he, like Yunas, broke the Law against intoxicants and, like him,\r\nrepented and returned.\r\n\r\nThat two men of the calibre and high repute of Ahrari and Yunas\r\nmaintained friendly guidance so long over `Umar cannot but be held an\r\naccreditment and give fragrance of goodness to his name. Apart from the\r\nhigh justice and generosity his son ascribes to him, he could set other\r\nexample, for he was a reader of great books, the Qoran and the _Masnawi_\r\nbeing amongst his favourites. This choice, it may be, led Abu'l-faẓl to\r\nsay he had the darwesh-mind. Babur was old enough before `Umar's death\r\nto profit by the sight of his father enjoying the perusal of such books.\r\nAs with other parents and other children, there would follow the happy\r\nstilling to a quiet mood, the piquing of curiosity as to what was in the\r\nbook, the sight of refuge taken as in a haven from self and care, and\r\nperhaps, Babur being intelligent and of inquiring mind and `Umar a\r\nskilled reciter, the boy would marvel at the perennial miracle that a\r\nlifeless page can become eloquent—gentle hints all, pointers of the way\r\nto literary creation.\r\n\r\nFew who are at home in Baburiana but will take Timur as Babur's great\r\nexemplar not only as a soldier but as a chronicler. Timur cannot have\r\nseemed remote from that group of people so well-informed about him and\r\nhis civilian doings; his Shahrukhi grandchildren in Samarkand had\r\ncarried on his author-tradition; the 74 years of Yunas Khan's life had\r\nbridged the gap between Timur's death in 807-1405 and Babur's birth in\r\n888-1483. To Babur Timur will have been exemplary through his grandson\r\nAulugh Beg who has two productions to his credit, the _Char-ulus_ (Four\r\nHordes) and the Kurkani Astronomical Tables. His sons, again, Babur\r\n(_qalandar_) and Ibrahim carried on the family torch of letters, the\r\nfirst in verse and the second by initiating and fostering Yazdi's\r\nlabours on the _Zafar-nama_. Wide-radiating and potent influence for the\r\nArts of Peace came forth from Herat during the reign of that Sultan\r\nHusain Mirza whose Court Babur describes in one of the best supplements\r\nto his autobiography. Husain was a Timurid of the elder branch of\r\nBai-qara, an author himself but far more effective as a Macænas; one man\r\nof the shining galaxy of competence that gave him fame, set pertinent\r\nexample for Babur the author, namely, the Andijani of noble Chaghatai\r\nfamily, 'Ali-sher _Nawa'i_ who, in classic Turki verse was the master\r\nBabur was to become in its prose. That the standard of effort was high\r\nin Herat is clear from Babur's dictum (p. 233) that whatever work a man\r\ntook up, he aspired to bring it to perfection. Elphinstone varies the\r\nsame theme to the tune of equality of excellence apart from social\r\nstatus, writing to Erskine (August, 1826), that \"it gives a high notion\r\nof the time to find\" (in Babur's account of Husain's Court) \"artists,\r\nmusicians and others, described along with the learned and great of the\r\nAge\".\r\n\r\nMy meagre summary of Babur's exemplars would be noticeably incomplete if\r\nit omitted mention of two of his life-long helpers in the gentler Arts,\r\nhis love of Nature and his admiration for great architectural creations.\r\nThe first makes joyous accompaniment throughout his book; the second is\r\nspecially called forth by Timur's ennoblement of Samarkand. Timur had\r\nbuilt magnificently and laid out stately gardens; Babur made many a\r\nfruitful pleasaunce and gladdened many an arid halting-place; he built a\r\nlittle, but had small chance to test his capacity for building greatly;\r\nnever rich, he was poor in Kabul and several times destitute in his\r\nhome-lands. But his sword won what gave wealth to his Indian Dynasty,\r\nand he passed on to it the builder's unused dower, so that Samarkand was\r\nsurpassed in Hindustan and the spiritual conception Timur's creations\r\nembodied took perfect form at Sikandra where Akbar lies entombed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS OF THE MUTILATED BABUR-NAMA.\r\n\r\nLosses from the text of Babur's book are the more disastrous because it\r\ntruly embodies his career. For it has the rare distinction of being\r\ncontemporary with the events it describes, is boyish in his boyhood,\r\ngrows with his growth, matures as he matured. Undulled by retrospect, it\r\nis a fresh and spontaneous recital of things just seen, heard or done.\r\nIt has the further rare distinction of shewing a boy who, setting a\r\nfuture task before him—in his case the revival of Timurid power,—began\r\nto chronicle his adventure in the book which through some 37 years was\r\nhis twinned comrade, which by its special distinctions has attracted\r\nreaders for nearly a half-millennium, still attracts and still is a\r\nthing apart from autobiographies which look back to recall dead years.\r\n\r\nMuch circumstance makes for the opinion that Babur left his life-record\r\ncomplete, perhaps repaired in places and recently supplemented, but\r\ncontinuous, orderly and lucid; this it is not now, nor has been since it\r\nwas translated into Persian in 1589, for it is fissured by _lacunæ_, has\r\nneither Preface nor Epilogue,[5] opens in an oddly abrupt and\r\nincongruous fashion, and consists of a series of fragments so\r\ndisconnected as to demand considerable preliminary explanation. Needless\r\nto say, its dwindled condition notwithstanding, it has place amongst\r\ngreat autobiographies, still revealing its author playing a man's part\r\nin a drama of much historic and personal interest. Its revelation is\r\nhowever now like a portrait out of drawing, because it has not kept the\r\nrecord of certain years of his manhood in which he took momentous\r\ndecisions,(1) those of 1511-12 (918) in which he accepted\r\nreinforcement—at a great price—from Isma`il the Shi`a Shah of Persia,\r\nand in which, if my reading be correct, he first (1512) broke the Law\r\nagainst the use of wine,[6] (2) those of 1519-1525 [926-932], in which\r\nhis literary occupations with orthodox Law (_see Mubin_) associated with\r\ncognate matters of 932 AH. indicate that his return to obedience had\r\nbegun, in which too was taken the decision that worked out for his fifth\r\nexpedition across the Indus with its sequel of the conquest of Hind.—The\r\nloss of matter so weighty cannot but destroy the balance of his record\r\nand falsify the drawing of his portrait.\r\n\r\n\r\na. _Problem of Titles._\r\n\r\nAs nothing survives to decide what was Babur's chosen title for his\r\nautobiography, a modern assignment of names to distinguish it from its\r\nvarious descendants is desirable, particularly so since the revival of\r\ninterest in it towards which the Facsimile of its Haidarabad Codex has\r\ncontributed.[7]\r\n\r\n_Babur-nama_ (History of Babur) is a well-warranted name by which to\r\ndistinguish the original Turki text, because long associated with this\r\nand rarely if ever applied to its Persian translation.[8] It is not\r\ncomprehensive because not covering supplementary matter of biography\r\nand description but it has use for modern readers of classing\r\nBabur's with other Timuriya and Timurid histories such as the\r\n_Zafar-Humayun-Akbar-namas_.\r\n\r\n_Waqi`āt-i-baburi_ (Babur's Acts), being descriptive of the book and in\r\ncommon use for naming both the Turki and Persian texts, might usefully\r\nbe reserved as a title for the latter alone.\r\n\r\nAmongst European versions of the book _Memoirs of Baber_ is Erskine's\r\npeculium for the Leyden and Erskine Perso-English translation—_Mémoires\r\nde Baber_ is Pavet de Courteille's title for his French version of the\r\nBukhara [Persified-Turki] compilation—_Babur-nama in English_ links the\r\ntranslation these volumes contain with its purely-Turki source.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. _Problems of the Constituents of the Books._\r\n\r\nIntact or mutilated, Babur's material falls naturally into three\r\nterritorial divisions, those of the lands of his successive rule,\r\nFarghana (with Samarkand), Kabul and Hindustan. With these are distinct\r\nsub-sections of description of places and of obituaries of kinsmen.\r\n\r\nThe book might be described as consisting of annals and diary, which\r\nonce met within what is now the gap of 1508-19 (914-925). Round this\r\ngap, amongst others, bristle problems of which this change of literary\r\nstyle is one; some are small and concern the mutilation alone, others\r\nare larger, but all are too intricate for terse statement and all might\r\nbe resolved by the help of a second MS. _e.g._ one of the same strain as\r\nHaidar's.\r\n\r\nWithout fantasy another constituent might be counted in with the three\r\nterritorial divisions, namely, the grouped _lacunæ_ which by their\r\nengulfment of text are an untoward factor in an estimate either of Babur\r\nor of his book. They are actually the cardinal difficulty of the book as\r\nit now is; they foreshorten purview of his career and character and\r\ndetract from its merits; they lose it perspective and distort its\r\nproportions. That this must be so is clear both from the value and the\r\npreponderating amount of the lost text. It is no exaggeration to say\r\nthat while working on what survives, what is lost becomes like a\r\nhaunting presence warning that it must be remembered always as an\r\nintegral and the dominant part of the book.\r\n\r\nThe relative proportions of saved and lost text are highly\r\nsignificant:—Babur's commemorable years are about 47 and 10 months,\r\n_i.e._ from his birth on Feb. 14th 1483 to near his death on Dec. 26th\r\n1530; but the aggregate of surviving text records some 18 years only,\r\nand this not continuously but broken through by numerous gaps. That\r\nthese gaps result from loss of pages is frequently shewn by a broken\r\nsentence, an unfinished episode. The fragments—as they truly may be\r\ncalled—are divided by gaps sometimes seeming to remove a few pages only\r\n(cf. _s.a._ 935 AH.), sometimes losing the record of 6 and _cir._ 18\r\nmonths, sometimes of 6 and 11 years; besides these actual clefts in the\r\nnarrative there are losses of some 12 years from its beginning and some\r\n16 months from its end. Briefly put we now have the record of _cir._ 18\r\nyears where that of over 47 could have been.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nc. _Causes of the gaps._\r\n\r\nVarious causes have been surmised to explain the _lacunæ_; on the plea\r\nof long intimacy with Babur's and Haidar's writings, I venture to say\r\nthat one and all appear to me the result of accident. This opinion rests\r\non observed correlations between the surviving and the lost record,\r\nwhich demand complement—on the testimony of Haidar's extracts, and\r\nfirmly on Babur's orderly and persistent bias of mind and on the\r\nprideful character of much of the lost record. Moreover occasions of\r\nrisk to Babur's papers are known.\r\n\r\nOf these occasions the first was the destruction of his camp near Hisar\r\nin 1512 (918; p. 357) but no information about his papers survives; they\r\nmay not have been in his tent but in the fort. The second was a case of\r\nrecorded damage to \"book and sections\" (p. 679) occurring in 1529 (935).\r\nFrom signs of work done to the Farghana section in Hindustan, the damage\r\nmay be understood made good at the later date. To the third exposure to\r\ndamage, namely, the attrition of hard travel and unsettled life during\r\nHumayun's 14 years of exile from rule in Hindustan (1441-1555) it is\r\nreasonable to attribute even the whole loss of text. For, assuming—as\r\nmay well be done—that Babur left (1530) a complete autobiography, its\r\nvolume would be safe so long as Humayun was in power but after the\r\nTimurid exodus (1441) his library would be exposed to the risks detailed\r\nin the admirable chronicles of Gul-badan, Jauhar and Bayazid (_q.v._).\r\nHe is known to have annotated his father's book in 1555 (p. 466 n. 1)\r\njust before marching from Kabul to attempt the re-conquest of Hindustan.\r\nHis Codex would return to Dihli which he entered in July 1555, and there\r\nwould be safe from risk of further mutilation. Its condition in 1555 is\r\nlikely to have remained what it was found when `Abdu'r-rahim translated\r\nit into Persian by Akbar's orders (1589) for Abu'l-faẓl's use in the\r\n_Akbar-nama_. That Persian translation with its descendant the _Memoirs\r\nof Baber_, and the purely-Turki Haidarabad Codex with its descendant the\r\n_Babur-nama in English_, contain identical contents and, so doing, carry\r\nthe date of the mutilation of Babur's Turki text back through its years\r\nof safety, 1589 to 1555, to the period of Humayun's exile and its\r\ndangers for camel-borne or deserted libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\nd. _Two misinterpretations of lacunæ._\r\n\r\nNot unnaturally the frequent interruptions of narrative caused by\r\n_lacunæ_ have been misinterpreted occasionally, and sometimes\r\ndetractory comment has followed on Babur, ranking him below the\r\naccomplished and lettered, steadfast and honest man he was. I select two\r\nexamples of this comment neither of which has a casual origin.\r\n\r\nThe first is from the _B.M. Cat. of Coins of the Shahs of Persia_ p.\r\nxxiv, where after identifying a certain gold coin as shewing vassalage\r\nby Babur to Isma`il _Safawi_, the compiler of the Catalogue notes, \"We\r\ncan now understand the omission from Babar's 'Memoirs' of the\r\noccurrences between 914 H. and 925 H.\" Can these words imply other than\r\nthat Babur suppressed mention of minting of the coins shewing\r\nacknowledgment of Shi`a suzerainty? Leaving aside the delicate topic of\r\nthe detraction the quoted words imply, much negatives the surmise that\r\nthe gap is a deliberate \"omission\" of text:—(1) the duration of the\r\nShi`a alliance was 19-20 months of 917-918 AH. (p. 355), why omit the\r\npeaceful or prideful and victorious record of some 9-10 years on its\r\neither verge? (2) Babur's Transoxus campaign was an episode in the\r\nstruggle between Shaibaq Khan (Shaibani) _Auzbeg_ and Shah\r\nIsma`il—between Sunni and Shi`a; how could \"omission\" from his book,\r\nalways a rare one, hide what multitudes knew already? \"Omission\" would\r\nhave proved a fiasco in another region than Central Asia, because the\r\nBabur-Haidar story of the campaign, vassal-coinage included,[10] has\r\nbeen brought into English literature by the English translation of the\r\n_Tarikh-i rashidi_. Babur's frank and self-judging habit of mind would,\r\nI think, lead him to write fully of the difficulties which compelled the\r\nhated alliance and certainly he would tell of his own anger at the\r\nconduct of the campaign by Isma`il's Commanders. The alliance was a\r\ntactical mistake; it would have served Babur better to narrate its\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nThe second misinterpretation, perhaps a mere surmising gloss, is\r\nErskine's (_Memoirs_ Supp. p. 289) who, in connection with `Alam Khan's\r\nrequest to Babur for reinforcement in order to oust his nephew Ibrahim,\r\nobserves that \"Babur probably flattered `Alam Khan with the hope of\r\nsuccession to the empire of Hindustan.\" This idea does not fit the\r\nrecord of either man. Elphinstone was angered by Erskine's remark which,\r\nhe wrote (Aug. 26th 1826) \"had a bad effect on the narrative by\r\nweakening the implicit confidence in Babur's candour and veracity which\r\nhis frank way of writing is so well-calculated to command.\"\r\nElphinstone's opinion of Babur is not that of a reader but of a student\r\nof his book; he was also one of Erskine's staunchest helpers in its\r\nproduction. From Erskine's surmise others have advanced on the\r\ndetractor's path saying that Babur used and threw over `Alam Khan\r\n(_q.v._).\r\n\r\n\r\ne. _Reconstruction._\r\n\r\nAmongst the problems mutilation has created an important one is that of\r\nthe condition of the beginning of the book (p. 1 to p. 30) with its\r\nplunge into Babur's doings in his 12th year without previous mention of\r\neven his day and place of birth, the names and status of his parents, or\r\nany occurrences of his præ-accession years. Within those years should be\r\nentered the death of Yunas Khan (1487) with its sequent obituary notice,\r\nand the death of [Khwaja `Ubaidu'l-lah] Ahrari (1491). Not only are\r\nthese customary entries absent but the very introductions of the two\r\ngreat men are wanting, probably with the also missing account of their\r\nnaming of the babe Babur. That these routine matters are a part of an\r\nautobiography planned as Babur's was, makes for assured opinion that the\r\nrecord of more than his first decade of life has been lost, perhaps by\r\nthe attrition to which its position in the volume exposed it.\r\n\r\nUseful reconstruction if merely in tabulated form, might be effected in\r\na future edition. It would save at least two surprises for readers, one\r\nthe oddly abrupt first sentence telling of Babur's age when he became\r\nruler in Farghana (p. 1), which is a misfit in time and order, another\r\nthat of the sudden interruption of `Umar Shaikh's obituary by a fragment\r\nof Yunas Khan's (p. 19) which there hangs on a mere name-peg, whereas\r\nits place according to Babur's elsewhere unbroken practice is directly\r\nfollowing the death. The record of the missing præ-accession years will\r\nhave included at the least as follows:—Day of birth and its place—names\r\nand status of parents—naming and the ceremonial observances proper for\r\nMuhammadan children—visits to kinsfolk in Tashkint, and to Samarkand\r\n(æt. 5, p. 35) where he was betrothed—his initiation in school\r\nsubjects, in sport, the use of arms—names of teachers—education in the\r\nrules of his Faith (p. 44), appointment to the Andijan Command _etc._,\r\n_etc._\r\n\r\nThere is now no fit beginning to the book; the present first sentence\r\nand its pendent description of Farghana should be removed to the\r\nposition Babur's practice dictates of entering the description of a\r\nterritory at once on obtaining it (cf. Samarkand, Kabul, Hindustan). It\r\nmight come in on p. 30 at the end of the topic (partly omitted on p. 29\r\nwhere no ground is given for the manifest anxiety about Babur's safety)\r\nof the disputed succession (Haidar, trs. p. 135) Babur's partisan begs\r\nhaving the better of Jahangir's (_q.v._), and having testified\r\nobeisance, he became ruler in Farghana; his statement of age (12 years),\r\ncomes in naturally and the description of his newly acquired territory\r\nfollows according to rule. This removal of text to a later position has\r\nthe advantage of allowing the accession to follow and not precede\r\nBabur's father's death.\r\n\r\nBy the removal there is left to consider the historical matter of pp.\r\n12-13. The first paragraph concerns matter of much earlier date than\r\n`Umar's death in 1494 (p. 13); it may be part of an obituary notice,\r\nperhaps that of Yunas Khan. What follows of the advance of displeased\r\nkinsmen against `Umar Shaikh would fall into place as part of Babur's\r\nrecord of his boyhood, and lead on to that of his father's death.\r\n\r\nThe above is a bald sketch of what might be effected in the interests of\r\nthe book and to facilitate its pleasant perusal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE TURKI MSS. AND WORK CONNECTING WITH THEM.\r\n\r\nThis chapter is a literary counterpart of \"Babur Padshah's Stone-heap,\"\r\nthe roadside cairn tradition says was piled by his army, each man laying\r\nhis stone when passing down from Kabul for Hindustan in the year of\r\nvictory 1525 (932).[11]\r\n\r\nFor a title suiting its contents is \"Babur Padshah's Book-pile,\" because\r\nit is fashioned of item after item of pen-work done by many men in\r\nobedience to the dictates given by his book. Unlike the cairn, however,\r\nthe pile of books is not of a single occasion but of many, not of a\r\nsingle year but of many, irregularly spacing the 500 years through which\r\nhe and his autobiography have had Earth's immortality.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart I. The MSS. themselves.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary._—Much of the information given below was published in the\r\nJournal of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1900 onwards, as it came into\r\nmy possession during a search for reliable Turki text of the\r\n_Babur-nama_. My notes were progressive; some MSS. were in distant\r\nplaces, some not traceable, but in the end I was able to examine in\r\nEngland all of whose continued existence I had become aware. It was\r\ninevitable that some of my earlier statements should be superseded\r\nlater; my Notes (_see s.n._ JRAS.) need clearing of transitory matter\r\nand summarizing, in particular those on the Elphinstone Codex and\r\nKlaproth's articles. Neither they nor what is placed here makes claim to\r\nbe complete. Other workers will supplement them when the World has\r\nrenewed opportunity to stroll in the bye-paths of literature.\r\n\r\nFew copies of the _Babur-nama_ seem to have been made; of the few I have\r\ntraced as existing, not one contains the complete autobiography, and one\r\nalone has the maximum of dwindled text shewn in the Persian translation\r\n(1589). Two books have been reputed to contain Babur's authentic text,\r\none preserved in Hindustan by his descendants, the other issuing from\r\nBukhara. They differ in total contents, arrangement and textual worth;\r\nmoreover the Bukhara book compiles items of divers diction and origin\r\nand date, manifestly not from one pen.\r\n\r\nThe Hindustan book is a record—now mutilated—of the Acts of Babur alone;\r\nthe Bukhara book as exhibited in its fullest accessible example, Kehr's\r\nCodex, is in two parts, each having its preface, the first reciting\r\nBabur's Acts, the second Humayun's.\r\n\r\nThe Bukhara book is a compilation of oddments, mostly translated from\r\ncompositions written after Babur's death. Textual and circumstantial\r\ngrounds warrant the opinion that it is a distinct work mistakenly\r\nbelieved to be Babur's own; to these grounds was added in 1903 the\r\nauthoritative verdict of collation with the Haidarabad Codex, and in\r\n1921 of the colophon of its original MS. in which its author gives his\r\nname, with the title and date of his compilation (JRAS. 1900, p. 474).\r\nWhat it is and what are its contents and history are told in Part III of\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II. Work on the Hindustan MSS.\r\n\r\nBABUR'S ORIGINAL CODEX.\r\n\r\nMy latest definite information about Babur's autograph MS. comes from\r\nthe _Padshah-nama_ (Bib. Ind. ed. ii, 4), whose author saw it in\r\nShah-i-jahan's private library between 1628 and 1638. Inference is\r\njustified, however, that it was the archetype of the Haidarabad Codex\r\nwhich has been estimated from the quality of its paper as dating _cir._\r\n1700 (JRAS. 1906, p. 97). But two subsequent historic disasters\r\ncomplicate all questions of MSS. missing from Indian libraries, namely,\r\nNadir Shah's vengeance on Dihli in 1739 and the dispersions and fires of\r\nthe Mutiny. Faint hope is kept alive that the original Codex may have\r\ndrifted into private hands, by what has occurred with the Rampur MS. of\r\nBabur's Hindustan verses (App. J), which also appears once to have\r\nbelonged to Shah-i-jahan.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAmongst items of work done during Babur's life are copies of his book\r\n(or of the Hindustan section of it) he mentions sending to sons and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe _Tabaqat-i-baburi_ was written during Babur's life by his Persian\r\nsecretary Shaikh Zainu'd-din of Khawaf; it paraphrases in rhetorical\r\nPersian the record of a few months of Hindustan campaigning, including\r\nthe battle of Panipat.\r\n\r\n  TABLE OF THE HINDUSTAN MSS.

It meets the need of an archetype, one marginally\r\n  annotated by Humayun, for the Elphinstone Codex in which a few\r\n  notes are marginal and signed, others are pell-mell,\r\n  interpolated in the text but attested by a scrutineer as having\r\n  been marginal in its archetype and mistakenly copied into its\r\n  text. This second set has been ineffectually sponged over. Thus\r\n  double collation is indicated (i) with Babur's autograph MS. to\r\n  clear out extra Babur matter, and (ii) with its archetype, to\r\n  justify the statement that in this the interpolations were\r\n  marginal.—No colophon survives with the much dwindled Elph.\r\n  Codex, but one, suiting the situation, has been observed, where\r\n  it is a complete misfit, appended to the Alwar Codex of the\r\n  second Persian translation, (estimated as copied in 1589). Into\r\n  the incongruities of that colophon it is not necessary to\r\n  examine here, they are too obvious to aim at deceit; it appears\r\n  fitly to be an imperfect translation from a Turki original,\r\n  this especially through its odd fashion of entitling \"Humayun\r\n  Padshah.\" It can be explained as translating the colophon of\r\n  the Codex (No. 2) which, as his possession, Humayun allowably\r\n  annotated and which makes it known that he had ordered\r\n  `Ali'u-'l-katib to copy his father's Turki book, and that it\r\n  was finished in February, 1531, some six weeks after Babur's\r\n  death.[15]\r\n\r\n  The later copy made in Humayun's first decade is Haidar Mirza's\r\n  (_infra_).\r\n\r\n\r\n  IV\r\n\r\n  Muhammad Haidar Mirza _Dughlat's_ possession of a copy of the\r\n  Autobiography is known both from his mention of it and through\r\n  numerous extracts translated from it in his _Tarikh-i-rashidi_.\r\n  As a good boy-penman (p. 22) he may have copied down to 1512\r\n  (918) while with Babur (p. 350), but for obtaining a transcript\r\n  of it his opportunity was while with Humayun before the\r\n  Timurid exodus of 1541. He died in 1551; his Codex is likely to\r\n  have found its way back from Kashmir to his ancestral home in\r\n  the Kashghar region and there it may still be. (_See_ T.R. trs.\r\n  Ney Elias' biography of him).\r\n\r\n\r\n  V\r\n\r\n  The Elphinstone Codex[16] has had an adventurous career. The\r\n  enigma of its archetype is posed above; it may have been copied\r\n  during Akbar's first decade (1556-67); its, perhaps first,\r\n  owner was a Bai-qara rebel (d. 1567) from amongst whose\r\n  possessions it passed into the Royal Library, where it was\r\n  cleared of foreign matter by the expunction of Humayun's\r\n  marginal notes which its scribe had interpolated into its text.\r\n  At a date I do not know, it must have left the Royal Library\r\n  for its fly-leaves bear entries of prices and in 1810 it was\r\n  found and purchased in Peshawar by Elphinstone. It went with\r\n  him to Calcutta, and there may have been seen by Leyden during\r\n  the short time between its arrival and the autumn month of the\r\n  same year (1810) when he sailed for Java. In 1813 Elphinstone\r\n  in Poona sent it to Erskine in Bombay, saying that he had\r\n  fancied it gone to Java and had been writing to `Izzatu'l-lah\r\n  to procure another MS. for Erskine in Bukhara, but that all the\r\n  time it was on his own shelves. Received after Erskine had\r\n  dolefully compared his finished work with Leyden's (tentative)\r\n  translation, Erskine sadly recommenced the review of his own\r\n  work. The Codex had suffered much defacement down to 908 (1502)\r\n  at the hands of \"a Persian Turk of Ganj\" who had interlined it\r\n  with explanations. It came to Scotland (with Erskine?) who in\r\n  1826 sent it with a covering letter (Dec. 12th, 1826), at its\r\n  owner's desire, to the Advocates' Library where it now is. In\r\n  1907 it was fully described by me in the JRAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VI\r\n\r\n  Of two _Waqi'at-i-baburi_ (Pers. trs.) made in Akbar's reign,\r\n  the earlier was begun in 1583, at private instance, by two\r\n  Mughuls Payanda-hasan of Ghazni and Muhammad-quli of Hisar.\r\n  The Bodleian and British Museum Libraries have copies of it,\r\n  very fragmentary unfortunately, for it is careful, likeable,\r\n  and helpful by its small explanatory glosses. It has the great\r\n  defect of not preserving autobiographic quality in its diction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VII\r\n\r\n  The later _Waqi'at-i-baburi_ translated by `Abdu'r-rahim Mirza\r\n  is one of the most important items in Baburiana, both by its\r\n  special characteristics as the work of a Turkman and not of a\r\n  Persian, and by the great service it has done. Its origin is\r\n  well-known; it was made at Akbar's order to help Abu'l-faẓl in\r\n  the Akbar-nāma account of Babur and also to facilitate perusal\r\n  of the _Babur-nama_ in Hindustan. It was presented to Akbar, by\r\n  its translator who had come up from Gujrat, in the last week of\r\n  November, 1589, on an occasion and at a place of admirable\r\n  fitness. For Akbar had gone to Kabul to visit Babur's tomb, and\r\n  was halting on his return journey at Barik-ab where Babur had\r\n  halted on his march down to Hindustan in the year of victory\r\n  1525, at no great distance from \"Babur Padshah's Stone-heap\".\r\n  Abu'l-faẓl's account of the presentation will rest on\r\n  `Abdu'r-rahim's information (A.N. trs. cap. ci). The diction of\r\n  this translation is noticeable; it gave much trouble to Erskine\r\n  who thus writes of it (_Memoirs_ Preface, lx), \"Though simple\r\n  and precise, a close adherence to the idioms and forms of\r\n  expression of the Turki original joined to a want of\r\n  distinctness in the use of the relatives, often renders the\r\n  meaning extremely obscure, and makes it difficult to discover\r\n  the connexion of the different members of the sentence.[17] The\r\n  style is frequently not Persian.... Many of the Turki words are\r\n  untranslated.\"\r\n\r\n  Difficult as these characteristics made Erskine's\r\n  interpretation, it appears to me likely that they indirectly\r\n  were useful to him by restraining his diction to some extent in\r\n  their Turki fettering.—This Turki fettering has another aspect,\r\n  apart from Erskine's difficulties, _viz_. it would greatly\r\n  facilitate re-translation into Turki, such as has been\r\n  effected, I think, in the Farghana section of the Bukhara\r\n  compilation.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n  VIII\r\n\r\n  This item of work, a harmless attempt of Salim (_i.e_. Jahangir\r\n  Padshah; 1605-28) to provide the ancestral autobiography with\r\n  certain stop-gaps, has caused much needless trouble and\r\n  discussion without effecting any useful result. It is this:—In\r\n  his own autobiography, the _Tuzuk-i-jahangiri s.a_. 1607, he\r\n  writes of a Babur-nama Codex he examined, that it was all in\r\n  Babur's \"blessed handwriting\" except four portions which were\r\n  in his own and each of which he attested in Turki as so being.\r\n  Unfortunately he did not specify his topics; unfortunately also\r\n  no attestation has been found to passages reasonably enough\r\n  attributable to his activities. His portions may consist of the\r\n  \"Rescue-passage\" (App. D) and a length of translation from the\r\n  _Akbar-nāma_, a continuous part of its Babur chapter but broken\r\n  up where only I have seen it, _i.e._ the Bukhara compilation,\r\n  into (1) a plain tale of Kanwa (1527), (2) episodes of Babur's\r\n  latter months (1529)—both transferred to the first person—and\r\n  (3) an account of Babur's death (December 26th, 1530) and\r\n  Court.\r\n\r\n  Jahangir's occupation, harmless in itself, led to an imbroglio\r\n  of Langlés with Erskine, for the former stating in the\r\n  _Biographie Universelle_ art. Babour, that Babour's\r\n  Commentaries \"_augmentés par Jahangir_\" were translated into\r\n  Persian by `Abdu'r-rahim. Erskine made answer, \"I know not on\r\n  what authority the learned Langlés hazarded this assertion,\r\n  which is certainly incorrect\" (_Memoirs_, Preface, p. ix). Had\r\n  Langlés somewhere met with Jahangir's attestations? He had\r\n  authority if he had seen merely the statement of 1607, but\r\n  Erskine was right also, because the Persian translation\r\n  contains no more than the unaugmented Turki text. The royal\r\n  stop-gaps are in Kehr's MS. and through Ilminski reached De\r\n  Courteille, whence the biting and thorough analysis of the\r\n  three \"Fragments\" by Teufel. Both episodes—the Langlés and the\r\n  Teufel ones—are time-wasters but they are comprehensible in\r\n  the circumstances that Jahangir could not foresee the\r\n  consequences of his doubtless good intentions.\r\n\r\n  If the question arise of how writings that had had place in\r\n  Jahangir's library reached Bukhara, their open road is through\r\n  the Padshah's correspondence (App. Q and references), with a\r\n  descendant of Ahrari in whose hands they were close to\r\n  Bukhara.[19]\r\n\r\n  It groups scattered information to recall that Salim (Jahangir)\r\n  was `Abdu'r-rahim's ward, that then, as now, Babur's\r\n  Autobiography was the best example of classic Turki, and that\r\n  it would appeal on grounds of piety—as it did appeal on some\r\n  sufficient ground—to have its broken story made good. Also that\r\n  for three of the four \"portions\" Abu'l-fazl's concise matter\r\n  was to hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n  IX\r\n\r\n  My information concerning Baburiana under Shah-i-jahan Padshah\r\n  (1628-58) is very meagre. It consists of (1) his attestation of\r\n  a signature of Babur (App. Q and photo), (2) his possession of\r\n  Babur's autograph Codex (_Padshah-nama_, Bib. Ind. ed., ii, 4),\r\n  and (3) his acceptance, and that by his literary entourage, of\r\n  Mir Abu-talib _Husaini's_ Persian translation of Timur's\r\n  Annals, the _Malfuzat_ whose preparation the _Zafar-nama_\r\n  describes and whose link with Babur's writings is that of the\r\n  exemplar to the emulator.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n  X\r\n\r\n  The Haidarabad Codex may have been inscribed under Aurang-zib\r\n  Padshah (1655-1707). So many particulars about it have been\r\n  given already that little needs saying here.[21] It was the\r\n  _grande trouvaille_ of my search for Turki text wherewith to\r\n  revive Babur's autobiography both in Turki and English. My\r\n  husband in 1900 saw it in Haidarabad; through the kind offices\r\n  of the late Sayyid Ali _Bilgrami_ it was lent to me; it proved\r\n  to surpass, both in volume and quality, all other Babur-nama\r\n  MSS. I had traced; I made its merits known to Professor Edward\r\n  Granville Browne, just when the E. J. Wilkinson Gibb Trust was\r\n  in formation, with the happy and accordant result that the best\r\n  prose book in classic Turki became the first item in the\r\n  Memorial—_matris ad filium_—of literary work done in the name\r\n  of the Turkish scholar, and Babur's very words were safeguarded\r\n  in hundred-fold facsimile. An event so important for\r\n  autobiography and for Turki literature may claim more than the\r\n  bald mention of its occurrence, because sincere autobiography,\r\n  however ancient, is human and social and undying, so that this\r\n  was no mere case of multiplying copies of a book, but was one\r\n  of preserving a man's life in his words. There were, therefore,\r\n  joyful red-letter days in the English story of the\r\n  Codex—outstanding from others being those on which its merits\r\n  revealed themselves (on Surrey uplands)—the one which brought\r\n  Professor Browne's acceptance of it for reproduction by the\r\n  Trust—and the day of pause from work marked by the accomplished\r\n  fact of the safety of the _Babur-nama._\r\n\r\n\r\n  XI\r\n\r\n  The period from _cir._ 1700, the date of the Haidarabad Codex,\r\n  and 1810, when the Elphinstone Codex was purchased by its\r\n  sponsor at Peshawar, appears to have been unfruitful in work on\r\n  the Hindustan MSS. Causes for this may connect with historic\r\n  events, _e.g._ Nadir Shah's desolation of Dihli and the rise of\r\n  the East India Company, and, in Baburiana, with the\r\n  disappearance of Babur's autograph Codex (it was unknown to the\r\n  Scots of 1800-26), and the transfer of the Elphinstone Codex\r\n  from royal possession—this, possibly however, an accident of\r\n  royal travel to and from Kabul at earlier dates.\r\n\r\n  The first quarter of the nineteenth century was, on the\r\n  contrary, most fruitful in valuable work, useful impulse to\r\n  which was given by Dr. John Leyden who in about 1805 began to\r\n  look into Turki. Like his contemporary Julius Klaproth\r\n  (_q.v._), he was avid of tongues and attracted by Turki and by\r\n  Babur's writings of which he had some knowledge through the\r\n  `Abdu'r-rahim (Persian) translation. His Turki text-book would\r\n  be the MS. of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,[22] a part-copy of\r\n  the Bukhara compilation, from which he had the India Office MS.\r\n  copied. He took up Turki again in 1810, after his return from\r\n  Malay and whilst awaiting orders in Calcutta for departure to\r\n  Java. He sailed in the autumn of the year and died in August\r\n  1811. Much can be learned about him and his Turki occupations\r\n  from letters (_infra_ xiii) written to Erskine by him and by\r\n  others of the Scottish band which now achieved such fine\r\n  results for Babur's Autobiography.\r\n\r\n  It is necessary to say something of Leyden's part in producing\r\n  the _Memoirs_, because Erskine, desiring to \"lose nothing that\r\n  might add to Leyden's reputation\", has assigned to him an undue\r\n  position of collaboration in it both by giving him premier\r\n  place on its title-page and by attributing to him the beginning\r\n  the translation. What one gleans of Leyden's character makes an\r\n  impression of unassumption that would forbid his acceptance of\r\n  the posthumous position given to him, and, as his translation\r\n  shews the tyro in Turki, there can be no ground for supposing\r\n  he would wish his competence in it over-estimated. He had, as\r\n  dates show, nothing to do with the actual work of the _Memoirs_\r\n  which was finished before Erskine had seen in 1813 what Leyden\r\n  had set down before he died in 1811. As the _Memoirs_ is now a\r\n  rare book, I quote from it what Erskine says (Preface, p. ix)\r\n  of Leyden's rough translation:—\"This acquisition (_i.e_. of\r\n  Leyden's trs.) reduced me to rather an awkward dilemma. The two\r\n  translations (his own and Leyden's) differed in many important\r\n  particulars; but as Dr. Leyden had the advantage of translating\r\n  from the original, I resolved to adopt his translation as far\r\n  as it went, changing only such expressions in it as seemed\r\n  evidently to be inconsistent with the context, or with other\r\n  parts of the _Memoirs_, or such as seemed evidently to\r\n  originate in the oversights that are unavoidable in an\r\n  unfinished work.[23] This labour I had completed with some\r\n  difficulty, when Mr. Elphinstone sent me the copy of the\r\n  _Memoirs of Baber_ in the original Tūrkī (_i.e._ The\r\n  Elphinstone Codex) which he had procured when he went to\r\n  Peshawar on his embassy to Kabul. This copy, which he had\r\n  supposed to have been sent with Dr. Leyden's manuscripts from\r\n  Calcutta, he was now fortunate enough to recover (in his own\r\n  library at Poona). The discovery of this valuable manuscript\r\n  reduced me, though heartily sick of the task, to the necessity\r\n  of commencing my work once more.\"\r\n\r\n  Erskine's Preface (pp. x, xi) contains various other references\r\n  to Leyden's work which indicate its quality as tentative and\r\n  unrevised. It is now in the British Museum Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XII\r\n\r\n  Little need be said here about the _Memoirs of Baber_.[24]\r\n  Erskine worked on a basis of considerable earlier acquaintance\r\n  with his Persian original, for, as his Preface tells, he had\r\n  (after Leyden's death) begun to translate this some years\r\n  before he definitely accepted the counsel of Elphinstone and\r\n  Malcolm to undertake the _Memoirs_. He finished his translation\r\n  in 1813, and by 1816 was able to dedicate his complete volume\r\n  to Elphinstone, but publication was delayed till 1826. His was\r\n  difficult pioneer-work, and carried through with the drawback\r\n  of working on a secondary source. It has done yeoman service,\r\n  of which the crowning merit is its introduction of Babur's\r\n  autobiography to the Western world.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XIII\r\n\r\n  Amongst Erskine's literary remains are several bound volumes of\r\n  letters from Elphinstone, Malcolm, Leyden, and others of that\r\n  distinguished group of Scots who promoted the revival of\r\n  Babur's writings. Erskine's grandson, the late Mr. Lestocq\r\n  Erskine, placed these, with other papers, at our disposal, and\r\n  they are now located where they have been welcomed as\r\n  appropriate additions:—Elphinstone's are in the Advocates'\r\n  Library, where already (1826) he, through Erskine, had\r\n  deposited his own Codex—and with his letters are those of\r\n  Malcolm and more occasional correspondents; Leyden's letters\r\n  (and various papers) are in the Memorial Cottage maintained in\r\n  his birthplace Denholm (Hawick) by the Edinburgh Border\r\n  Counties Association; something fitting went to the Bombay\r\n  Asiatic Society and a volume of diary to the British Museum.\r\n  Leyden's papers will help his fuller biography; Elphinstone's\r\n  letters have special value as recording his co-operation with\r\n  Erskine by much friendly criticism, remonstrance against delay,\r\n  counsels and encouragement. They, moreover, shew the estimate\r\n  an accomplished man of modern affairs formed of Babur Padshah's\r\n  character and conduct; some have been quoted in Colebrooke's\r\n  _Life of Elphinstone_, but there they suffer by detachment from\r\n  the rest of his Baburiana letters; bound together as they now\r\n  are, and with brief explanatory interpolations, they would make\r\n  a welcome item for \"Babur Padshah's Book-pile\".\r\n\r\n\r\n  XIV\r\n\r\n  In May 1921 the contents of these volumes were completed,\r\n  namely, the _Babur-nama in English_ and its supplements, the\r\n  aims of which are to make Babur known in English diction\r\n  answering to his _ipsissima verba_, and to be serviceable to\r\n  readers and students of his book and of classic Turki.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XV\r\n\r\n  Of writings based upon or relating to Babur's the following\r\n  have appeared:—\r\n\r\n   Denkwurdigkeiten des Zahir-uddin Muhammad Babar—A.

The \"Bukhara Babur-nama\".\r\n\r\nThis is a singular book and has had a career as singular as its\r\ncharacteristics, a very comedy of (blameless) errors and mischance. For\r\nit is a compilation of items diverse in origin, diction, and age,\r\nplanned to be a record of the Acts of Babur and Humayun, dependent\r\nthrough its Babur portion on the `Abdu'r-rahim Persian translation for\r\nre-translation, or verbatim quotation, or dove-tailing effected on the\r\ntattered fragments of what had once been Kamran's Codex of the\r\nBabur-nama proper, the whole interspersed by stop-gaps attributable to\r\nJahangir. These and other specialities notwithstanding, it ranked for\r\nnearly 200 years as a reproduction of Babur's authentic text, as such\r\nwas sent abroad, as such was reconstructed and printed in Kasan (1857),\r\ntranslated in Paris (1871), catalogued for the Petrograd Oriental School\r\n(1894), and for the India Office (1903).[25]\r\n\r\nManifest causes for the confusion of identity are, (1) lack of the\r\nguidance in Bukhara and Petrograd of collation with the true text, (2)\r\nwant of information, in the Petrograd of 1700-25, about Babur's career,\r\ncoupled with the difficulties of communication with Bukhara, (3) the\r\nmisleading feature in the compiled book of its author's retention of the\r\nautobiographic form of his sources, without explanation as to whether he\r\nentered surviving fragments of Kamran's Codex, patchings or extracts\r\nfrom `Abdu'r-rahim's Persian translation, or quotations of Jahangir's\r\nstop-gaps. Of these three causes for error the first is dominant,\r\nentailing as it does the drawbacks besetting work on an inadequate\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to enumerate the items of the Compilation here as they\r\nare arranged in Kehr's autograph Codex, because that codex (still in\r\nLondon) may not always be accessible,[26] and because the imprint does\r\nnot obey its model, but aims at closer agreement of the Bukhara\r\nCompilation with Ilminski's gratefully acknowledged guide—_The Memoirs\r\nof Baber_. Distinction in commenting on the Bukhara and the Kasan\r\nversions is necessary; their discrepancy is a scene in the comedy of\r\nerrors.[27][28][29][30]\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF THE HISTORY OF THE COMPILATION.\r\n\r\nAn impelling cause for the production of the Bukhara compilation is\r\nsuggested by the date 1709 at which was finished the earliest example\r\nknown to me. For in the first decade of the eighteenth century Peter the\r\nGreat gave attention to Russian relations with foreign states of Central\r\nAsia and negociated with the Khan of Bukhara for the reception of a\r\nRussian mission.[31] Political aims would be forwarded if envoys were\r\nfamiliar with Turki; books in that tongue for use in the School of\r\nOriental Languages would be desired; thus the Compilation may have been\r\nprompted and, as will be shown later, it appears to have been produced,\r\nand not merely copied, in 1709. The Mission's despatch was delayed till\r\n1719;[32] it arrived in Bukhara in 1721; during its stay a member of its\r\nsecretariat bought a Compilation MS. noted as finished in 1714 and on a\r\nfly-leaf of it made the following note:—\r\n\r\n\"_I, Timur-pulad son of Mirza Rajab son of Pay-chin, bought this book\r\nBabur-nama after coming to Bukhara with [the] Russian Florio Beg\r\nBeneveni, envoy of the Padshah ... whose army is numerous as the\r\nstars.... May it be well received! Amen! O Lord of both Worlds!_\"\r\n\r\nTimur-pulad's hope for a good reception indicates a definite recipient,\r\nperhaps a commissioned purchase. The vendor may have been asked for a\r\nhistory of Babur; he sold one, but \"Babur-nama\" is not necessarily a\r\ntitle, and is not suitable for the Compilation; by conversational\r\nmischance it may have seemed so to the purchaser and thus have initiated\r\nthe mistake of confusing the \"Bukhara Babur-nama\" with the true one.\r\n\r\nThus endorsed, the book in 1725 reached the Foreign Office; there in\r\n1737 it was obtained by George Jacob Kehr, a teacher of Turki, amongst\r\nother languages, in the Oriental School, who copied it with meticulous\r\ncare, understanding its meaning imperfectly, in order to produce a Latin\r\nversion of it. His Latin rendering was a fiasco, but his reproduction of\r\nthe Arabic forms of his archetype was so obedient that on its sole basis\r\nIlminski edited the Kasan Imprint (1857). A collateral copy of the\r\nTimur-pulad Codex was made in 1742 (as has been said).\r\n\r\nIn 1824 Klaproth (who in 1810 had made a less valuable extract perhaps\r\nfrom Kehr's Codex) copied from the Timur-pulad MS. its purchaser's note,\r\nthe Auzbeg?(?) endorsement as to the transfer of the \"Kamran-docket\" and\r\nBabur's letter to Kamran (_Mémoires relatifs à l'Asie_ Paris).\r\n\r\nIn 1857 Ilminski, working in Kasan, produced his imprint, which became\r\nde Courteille's source for _Les Mémoires de Baber_ in 1871. No worker in\r\nthe above series shews doubt about accepting the Compilation as\r\ncontaining Babur's authentic text. Ilminski was in the difficult\r\nposition of not having entire reliance on Kehr's transcription, a\r\nnatural apprehension in face of the quality of the Latin version, his\r\ndoubts sum up into his words that a reliable text could not be made from\r\nhis source (Kehr's MS.), but that a Turki reading-book could—and was. As\r\nhas been said, he did not obey the dual plan of the Compilation Kehr's\r\ntranscript reveals, this, perhaps, because of the misnomer Babur-nama\r\nunder which Timur-pulad's Codex had come to Petrograd; this, certainly,\r\nbecause he thought a better history of Babur could be produced by\r\nfollowing Erskine than by obeying Kehr—a series of errors following the\r\nverbal mischance of 1725. Ilminski's transformation of the items of his\r\nsource had the ill result of misleading Pavet de Courteille to\r\nover-estimate his Turki source at the expense of Erskine's Persian one\r\nwhich, as has been said, was Ilminski's guide—another scene in the\r\ncomedy. A mischance hampering the French work was its falling to be done\r\nat a time when, in Paris 1871, there can have been no opportunity\r\navailable for learning the contents of Ilminski's Russian Preface or for\r\nquiet research and the examination of collateral aids from abroad.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR OF THE COMPILATION.\r\n\r\nThe Haidarabad Codex having destroyed acquiescence in the phantasmal\r\nview of the Bukhara book, the question may be considered, who was its\r\nauthor?\r\n\r\nThis question a convergence of details about the Turki MSS. reputed to\r\ncontain the _Babur-nama_, now allows me to answer with some semblance of\r\ntruth. Those details have thrown new light upon a colophon which I\r\nreceived in 1900 from Mr. C. Salemann with other particulars concerning\r\nthe \"_Senkovski Babur-nama_,\" this being an extract from the\r\nCompilation; its archetype reached Petrograd from Bukhara a century\r\nafter Kehr's [_viz._ the Timur-pulad Codex]; it can be taken as a direct\r\ncopy of the Mulla's original because it bears his colophon.[34] In 1900\r\nI accepted it as merely that of a scribe who had copied Senkovski's\r\narchetype, but in 1921 reviewing the colophon for this Preface, it seems\r\nto me to be that of the original autograph MS. of the Compilation and to\r\ntell its author's name, his title for his book, and the year (1709) in\r\nwhich he completed it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF BUKHARA REPUTED-BABUR-NAMA MSS.

J.\r\nSenkovski._\"\r\n\r\nThe colophon Senkovski copied from his archetype is to the following\r\npurport:—\r\n\r\n\"_Known and entitled Waqi`nama-i-padshahi (Record of Royal Acts), [this]\r\nautograph and composition (bayad u navisht) of Mulla `Abdu'l-wahhāb the\r\nTeacher, of Ghaj-davan in Bukhara—God pardon his mistakes and the\r\nweakness of his endeavour!—was finished on Monday, Rajab 5, 1121 (Aug.\r\n31st, 1709).—Thank God!_\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the title Waqi`nama-i-padshahi suits the plan\r\nof dual histories (of Babur and Humayun) better than does the\r\n\"Babur-nama\" of Timur-pulad's note, that the colophon does not claim for\r\nthe Mulla to have copied the elder book (1494-1530) but to have written\r\ndown and composed one under a differing title suiting its varied\r\ncontents; that the Mulla's deprecation and thanks tone better with\r\nperplexing work, such as his was, than with the steadfast patience of a\r\ngood scribe; and that it exonerates the Mulla from suspicion of having\r\ncaused his compilation to be accepted as Babur's authentic text. Taken\r\nwith its circumstanding matters, it may be the dénoument of the play.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE LEYDEN AND ERSKINE MEMOIRS OF BABER.\r\n\r\nThe fame and long literary services of the _Memoirs of Baber_ compel me\r\nto explain why these volumes of mine contain a verbally new English\r\ntranslation of the _Babur-nama_ instead of a second edition of the\r\n_Memoirs_. My explanation is the simple one of textual values, of the\r\nadvantage a primary source has over its derivative, Babur's original\r\ntext over its Persian translation which alone was accessible to Erskine.\r\n\r\nIf the _Babur-nama_ owed its perennial interest to its valuable\r\nmultifarious matter, the _Memoirs_ could suffice to represent it, but\r\nthis it does not; what has kept interest in it alive through some four\r\ncenturies is the autobiographic presentment of an arresting personality\r\nits whole manner, style and diction produce. It is characteristic\r\nthroughout, from first to last making known the personal quality of its\r\nauthor. Obviously that quality has the better chance of surviving a\r\ntransfer of Babur's words to a foreign tongue when this can be effected\r\nby imitation of them. To effect this was impracticable to Erskine who\r\ndid not see any example of the Turki text during the progress of his\r\ntranslation work and had little acquaintance with Turki. No blame\r\nattaches to his results; they have been the one introduction of Babur's\r\nwritings to English readers for almost a century; but it would be as\r\nsensible to expect a potter to shape a vessel for a specific purpose\r\nwithout a model as a translator of autobiography to shape the new verbal\r\ncontainer for Babur's quality without seeing his own. Erskine was the\r\npioneer amongst European workers on Baburiana—Leyden's fragment of\r\nunrevised attempt to translate the Bukhara Compilation being a\r\nnegligible matter, notwithstanding friendship's deference to it; he had\r\nready to his hand no such valuable collateral help as he bequeathed to\r\nhis successors in the Memoirs volume. To have been able to help in the\r\nrenewal of his book by preparing a second edition of it, revised under\r\nthe authority of the Haidarabad Codex, would have been to me an act of\r\nliterary piety to an old book-friend; I experimented and failed in the\r\nattempt; the wording of the Memoirs would not press back into the Turki\r\nmould. Being what it is, sound in its matter and partly representative\r\nof Babur himself, the all-round safer plan, one doing it the greater\r\nhonour, was to leave it unshorn of its redundance and unchanged in its\r\nwording, in the place of worth and dignity it has held so long.\r\n\r\nBrought to this point by experiment and failure, the way lay open to\r\nmake bee-line over intermediaries back to the fountain-head of\r\nre-discovered Turki text preserved in the Haidarabad Codex. Thus I have\r\nenjoyed an advantage no translator has had since `Abdu'r-rahim in 1589.\r\n\r\nConcerning matters of style and diction, I may mention that three\r\ndistinct impressions of Babur's personality are set by his own,\r\nErskine's and de Courteille's words and manner. These divergencies,\r\nwhile partly due to differing textual bases, may result mainly from the\r\nuse by the two Europeans of unsifted, current English and French. Their\r\nportrayal might have been truer, there can be no doubt, if each had\r\nrestricted himself to such under-lying component of his mother-tongue as\r\napproximates in linguistic stature to classic Turki. This probability\r\nErskine could not foresee for, having no access during his work to a\r\nTurki source and no familiarity with Turki, he missed their lessoning.\r\n\r\nTurki, as Babur writes it—terse, word-thrifty, restrained and\r\nlucid,—comes over neatly into Anglo-Saxon English, perhaps through\r\nprimal affinities. Studying Babur's writings in verbal detail taught me\r\nthat its structure, idiom and vocabulary dictate a certain mechanism for\r\na translator's imitation. Such are the simple sentence, devoid of\r\nrelative phrasing, copied in the form found, whether abrupt and brief\r\nor, ranging higher with the topic, gracious and dignified—the retention\r\nof Babur's use of \"we\" and \"I\" and of his frequent impersonal\r\nstatement—the matching of words by their root-notion—the strict\r\nobservance of Babur's limits of vocabulary, effected by allotting to one\r\nTurki word one English equivalent, thus excluding synonyms for which\r\nTurki has little use because not shrinking from the repeated word;\r\nlastly, as preserving relations of diction, the replacing of Babur's\r\nArabic and Persian aliens by Greek and Latin ones naturalized in\r\nEnglish. Some of these aids towards shaping a counterpart of Turki may\r\nbe thought small, but they obey a model and their aggregate has power to\r\nmake or mar a portrait.\r\n\r\n(1) Of the uses of pronouns it may be said that Babur's \"we\" is neither\r\nregal nor self-magnifying but is co-operative, as beseems the chief\r\nwhose volunteer and nomad following makes or unmakes his power, and who\r\ncan lead and command only by remittent consent accorded to him. His \"I\"\r\nis individual. The _Memoirs_ varies much from these uses.\r\n\r\n(2) The value of reproducing impersonal statements is seen by the\r\nfollowing example, one of many similar:—When Babur and a body of men,\r\nmaking a long saddle-journey, halted for rest and refreshment by the\r\nroad-side; \"There was drinking,\" he writes, but Erskine, \"I drank\"; what\r\nis likely being that all or all but a few shared the local _vin du\r\npays_.\r\n\r\n(3) The importance of observing Babur's limits of vocabulary needs no\r\nstress, since any man of few words differs from any man of many.\r\nMeasured by the Babur-nama standard, the diction of the _Memoirs_ is\r\nredundant throughout, and frequently over-coloured. Of this a pertinent\r\nexample is provided by a statement of which a minimum of seven\r\noccurrences forms my example, namely, that such or such a man whose life\r\nBabur sketches was vicious or a vicious person (_fisq_, _fāsiq_).\r\nErskine once renders the word by \"vicious\" but elsewhere enlarges to\r\n\"debauched, excess of sensual enjoyment, lascivious, libidinous,\r\nprofligate, voluptuous\". The instances are scattered and certainly\r\nErskine could not feel their collective effect, but even scattered, each\r\ndoes its ill-part in distorting the Memoirs portraiture of the man of\r\nthe one word.[35]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT OF THANKS.\r\n\r\nI take with gratitude the long-delayed opportunity of finishing my book\r\nto express the obligation I feel to the Council of the Royal Asiatic\r\nSociety for allowing me to record in the Journal my Notes on the Turki\r\nCodices of the _Babur-nama_ begun in 1900 and occasionally appearing\r\ntill 1921. In minor convenience of work, to be able to gather those\r\nprogressive notes together and review them, has been of value to me in\r\nnoticeable matters, two of which are the finding and multiplying of the\r\nHaidarabad Codex, and the definite clearance of the confusion which had\r\nmade the Bukhara (reputed) _Babur-nama_ be mistaken for a reproduction\r\nof Babur's true text.\r\n\r\nImmeasurable indeed is the obligation laid on me by the happy community\r\nof interests which brought under our roof the translation of the\r\nbiographies of Babur, Humayun, and Akbar. What this has meant to my own\r\nwork may be surmised by those who know my husband's wide reading in many\r\ntongues of East and West, his retentive memory and his generous\r\ncommunism in knowledge. One signal cause for gratitude to him from those\r\ncaring for Baburiana, is that it was he made known the presence of the\r\nHaidarabad Codex in its home library (1899) and thus led to its\r\npreservation in facsimile.\r\n\r\nIt would be impracticable to enumerate all whose help I keep in grateful\r\nmemory and realize as the fruit of the genial camaraderie of letters.\r\n\r\n   ANNETTE S. BEVERIDGE.\r\n\r\n   PITFOLD, SHOTTERMILL, HASLEMERE.\r\n   _August, 1921._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEMOIRS OF BABUR\r\n\r\nSECTION I. FARGHĀNA.\r\n\r\n\r\n   In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn[36] the month of Ramẓān of the year 899 (June 1494) and [Sidenote:\r\nḤaidarābād MS. fol. 1b.] in the twelfth year of my age,[37] I became\r\nruler[38] in the country of Farghāna.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Description of Farghāna._)\r\n\r\nFarghāna is situated in the fifth climate[39] and at the limit of\r\nsettled habitation. On the east it has Kāshghar; on the west, Samarkand;\r\non the south, the mountains of the Badakhshān border; on the north,\r\nthough in former times there must have been towns such as Ālmālīgh,\r\nĀlmātū and Yāngī which in books they write Tarāz,[40] at the present\r\ntime all is desolate, no settled population whatever remaining, because\r\nof the Mughūls and the Aūzbegs.[41]\r\n\r\nFarghāna is a small country,[42] abounding in grain and fruits. It is\r\ngirt round by mountains except on the west, _i.e._ towards Khujand and\r\nSamarkand, and in winter[43] an enemy can enter only on that side.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 2.] The Saiḥūn River (_daryā_) commonly known as the\r\nWater of Khujand, comes into the country from the north-east, flows\r\nwestward through it and after passing along the north of Khujand and the\r\nsouth of Fanākat,[44] now known as Shāhrukhiya, turns directly north and\r\ngoes to Turkistān. It does not join any sea[45] but sinks into the\r\nsands, a considerable distance below [the town of] Turkistān.\r\n\r\nFarghāna has seven separate townships,[46] five on the south and two on\r\nthe north of the Saiḥūn.\r\n\r\nOf those on the south, one is Andijān. It has a central position and is\r\nthe capital of the Farghāna country. It produces much grain, fruits in\r\nabundance, excellent grapes and melons. In the melon season, it is not\r\ncustomary to sell them out at the beds.[47] Better than the Andijān\r\n_nāshpātī_,[48] there is none. After Samarkand and Kesh, the fort[49] of\r\nAndijān is the largest in Mawārā'u'n-nahr (Transoxiana). It has three\r\ngates. Its citadel (_ark_) is on its south side. Into it water goes by\r\nnine channels; out of it, it is strange that none comes at even a single\r\nplace.[50] Round the outer edge of the ditch[51] runs a gravelled\r\nhighway; the width of this highway divides the fort from the suburbs\r\nsurrounding it.\r\n\r\nAndijān has good hunting and fowling; its pheasants grow [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n2b.] so surprisingly fat that rumour has it four people could not\r\nfinish one they were eating with its stew.[52]\r\n\r\nAndijānīs are all Turks, not a man in town or bāzār but knows Turkī. The\r\nspeech of the people is correct for the pen; hence the writings of Mīr\r\n`Alī-shīr _Nawā'ī_,[53] though he was bred and grew up in Hīrī (Harāt),\r\nare one with their dialect. Good looks are common amongst them. The\r\nfamous musician, Khwāja Yūsuf, was an Andijānī.[54] The climate is\r\nmalarious; in autumn people generally get fever.[55]\r\n\r\nAgain, there is Aūsh (Ūsh), to the south-east, inclining to east, of\r\nAndijān and distant from it four _yīghāch_ by road.[56] It has a fine\r\nclimate, an abundance of running waters[57] and a most beautiful spring\r\nseason. Many traditions have their rise in its excellencies.[58] To the\r\nsouth-east of the walled town (_qūrghān_) lies a symmetrical mountain,\r\nknown as the Barā Koh;[59] on the top of this, Sl. Maḥmūd Khān built a\r\nretreat (_ḥajra_) and lower down, on its shoulder, I, in 902AH.\r\n(1496AD.) built another, having a porch. Though his lies the higher,\r\nmine is the better placed, the whole of the town and the suburbs being\r\nat its foot.\r\n\r\nThe Andijān torrent[60] goes to Andijān after having traversed\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 3.] the suburbs of Aūsh. Orchards (_bāghāt_)[61] lie\r\nalong both its banks; all the Aūsh gardens (_bāghlār_) overlook it;\r\ntheir violets are very fine; they have running waters and in spring are\r\nmost beautiful with the blossoming of many tulips and roses.\r\n\r\nOn the skirt of the Barā-koh is a mosque called the Jauza Masjid (Twin\r\nMosque).[62] Between this mosque and the town, a great main canal flows\r\nfrom the direction of the hill. Below the outer court of the mosque lies\r\na shady and delightful clover-meadow where every passing traveller takes\r\na rest. It is the joke of the ragamuffins of Aūsh to let out water from\r\nthe canal[63] on anyone happening to fall asleep in the meadow. A very\r\nbeautiful stone, waved red and white[64] was found in the Barā Koh in\r\n`Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's latter days; of it are made knife handles, and\r\nclasps for belts and many other things. For climate and for\r\npleasantness, no township in all Farghāna equals Aūsh.\r\n\r\nAgain there is Marghīnān; seven _yīghāch_[65] by road to the west of\r\nAndijān,—a fine township full of good things. Its apricots (_aūrūk_) and\r\npomegranates are most excellent. One sort of pomegranate, they call the\r\nGreat Seed (_Dāna-i-kalān_); its sweetness has a little of the pleasant\r\nflavour of the small apricot (_zard-alū_) and it may be thought better\r\nthan the Semnān pomegranate. [Sidenote: Fol. 3b.] Another kind of\r\napricot (_aūrūk_) they dry after stoning it and putting back the\r\nkernel;[66] they then call it _subḥānī_; it is very palatable. The\r\nhunting and fowling of Marghīnān are good; _āq kīyīk_[67] are had close\r\nby. Its people are Sārts,[68] boxers, noisy and turbulent. Most of the\r\nnoted bullies (_jangralār_) of Samarkand and Bukhārā are Marghīnānīs.\r\nThe author of the Hidāyat[69] was from Rashdān, one of the villages of\r\nMarghīnān.\r\n\r\nAgain there is Asfara, in the hill-country and nine _yīghāch_[70] by\r\nroad south-west of Marghīnān. It has running waters, beautiful little\r\ngardens (_bāghcha_) and many fruit-trees but almonds for the most part\r\nin its orchards. Its people are all Persian-speaking[71] Sārts. In the\r\nhills some two miles (_bīrshar`ī_) to the south of the town, is a piece\r\nof rock, known as the Mirror Stone.[72] It is some 10 arm-lengths\r\n(_qārī_) long, as high as a man in parts, up to his waist in others.\r\nEverything is reflected by it as by a mirror. The Asfara district\r\n(_wilāyat_) is in four subdivisions (_balūk_) in the hill-country, one\r\nAsfara, one Warūkh, one Sūkh and one Hushyār. When Muḥammad _Shaibānī_\r\nKhān defeated Sl. Maḥmūd Khān and Alacha Khān and took Tāshkīnt and\r\nShāhrukhiya,[73] I went into the Sūkh and Hushyār [Sidenote: Fol. 4.]\r\nhill-country and from there, after about a year spent in great misery, I\r\nset out _(`azīmat_) for Kābul.[74]\r\n\r\nAgain there is Khujand,[75] twenty-five _yīghāch_ by road to the west\r\nof Andijān and twenty-five _yīghāch_ east of Samarkand.[76] Khujand is\r\none of the ancient towns; of it were Shaikh Maṣlaḥat and Khwāja\r\nKamāl.[77] Fruit grows well there; its pomegranates are renowned for\r\ntheir excellence; people talk of a Khujand pomegranate as they do of a\r\nSamarkand apple; just now however, Marghīnān pomegranates are much met\r\nwith.[78] The walled town (_qūrghān_) of Khujand stands on high ground;\r\nthe Saiḥūn River flows past it on the north at the distance, may be, of\r\nan arrow's flight.[79] To the north of both the town and the river lies\r\na mountain range called Munūghul;[80] people say there are turquoise and\r\nother mines in it and there are many snakes. The hunting and\r\nfowling-grounds of Khujand are first-rate; _āq kīyīk_,[81]\r\n_būghū-marāl_,[82] pheasant and hare are all had in great plenty. The\r\nclimate is very malarious; in autumn there is much fever;[83] people\r\nrumour it about that the very sparrows get fever and say that the cause\r\nof the malaria is the mountain range on the north (_i.e._ Munūghul).\r\n\r\nKand-i-badām (Village of the Almond) is a dependency of Khujand; though\r\nit is not a township (_qaṣba_) it is rather a good approach to one\r\n(_qaṣbacha_). Its almonds are excellent, hence its name; they all go to\r\nHormuz or to Hindūstān. It is five or [Sidenote: Fol. 4b.] six\r\n_yīghāch_[84] east of Khujand.\r\n\r\nBetween Kand-i-badām and Khujand lies the waste known as Hā Darwesh. In\r\nthis there is always (_hamesha_) wind; from it wind goes always\r\n(_hameshā_) to Marghīnān on its east; from it wind comes continually\r\n(_dā'im_) to Khujand on its west.[85] It has violent, whirling winds.\r\nPeople say that some darweshes, encountering a whirlwind in this\r\ndesert,[86] lost one another and kept crying, \"Hāy Darwesh! Hāy\r\nDarwesh!\" till all had perished, and that the waste has been called Hā\r\nDarwesh ever since.\r\n\r\nOf the townships on the north of the Saiḥūn River one is Akhsī. In books\r\nthey write it Akhsīkīt[87] and for this reason the poet As̤iru-d-dīn is\r\nknown as _Akhsīkītī_. After Andijān no township in Farghāna is larger\r\nthan Akhsī. It is nine _yīghāch_[88] by road to the west of Andijān.\r\n`Umar Shaikh Mīrzā made it his capital.[89] The Saiḥūn River flows below\r\nits walled town (_qūrghān_). This stands above a great ravine (_buland\r\njar_) and it has deep ravines (_`uṃiq jarlār_) in place of a moat. When\r\n`Umar Shaikh Mīrzā made it his capital, he once or twice cut other\r\nravines from the outer ones. In all Farghāna no fort is so strong as\r\nAkhsī. *Its suburbs extend some two miles further [Sidenote: Fol. 5.]\r\nthan the walled town.* People seem to have made of Akhsī the saying\r\n(_mis̤al_), \"Where is the village? Where are the trees?\" (_Dih kujā?\r\nDirakhtān kujā?_) Its melons are excellent; they call one kind Mīr\r\nTīmūrī; whether in the world there is another to equal it is not known.\r\nThe melons of Bukhārā are famous; when I took Samarkand, I had some\r\nbrought from there and some from Akhsī; they were cut up at an\r\nentertainment and nothing from Bukhārā compared with those from Akhsī.\r\nThe fowling and hunting of Akhsī are very good indeed; _āq kīyīk_ abound\r\nin the waste on the Akhsī side of the Saihūn; in the jungle on the\r\nAndijān side _būghū-marāl_,[90] pheasant and hare are had, all in very\r\ngood condition.\r\n\r\nAgain there is Kāsān, rather a small township to the north of Akhsī.\r\nFrom Kāsān the Akhsī water comes in the same way as the Andijān water\r\ncomes from Aūsh. Kāsān has excellent air and beautiful little gardens\r\n(_bāghcha_). As these gardens all lie along the bed of the torrent\r\n(_sā'ī_) people call them the \"fine front of the coat.\"[91] Between\r\nKāsānīs and Aūshīs there is rivalry about the beauty and climate of\r\ntheir townships.\r\n\r\nIn the mountains round Farghāna are excellent summer-pastures (_yīlāq_).\r\nThere, and nowhere else, the _tabalghū_[92]grows, a tree (_yīghāch_)\r\nwith red bark; they make staves of it; they [Sidenote: Fol. 5b.] make\r\nbird-cages of it; they scrape it into arrows;[93] it is an excellent\r\nwood (_yīghāch_) and is carried as a rarity[94] to distant places. Some\r\nbooks write that the mandrake[95] is found in these mountains but for\r\nthis long time past nothing has been heard of it. A plant called _Āyīq\r\naūtī_[96] and having the qualities of the mandrake (_mihr-giyāh_), is\r\nheard of in Yītī-kīnt;[97] it seems to be the mandrake (_mihr-giyāh_)\r\nthe people there call by this name (_i.e._ _āyīq aūtī_). There are\r\nturquoise and iron mines in these mountains.\r\n\r\nIf people do justly, three or four thousand men[98] may be maintained by\r\nthe revenues of Farghāna.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Historical narrative resumed._)[99]\r\n\r\nAs `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā was a ruler of high ambition and great pretension,\r\nhe was always bent on conquest. On several occasions he led an army\r\nagainst Samarkand; sometimes he was beaten, sometimes retired against\r\nhis will.[100] More than once he asked his father-in-law into the\r\ncountry, that is to say, my grandfather, Yūnas Khān, the then Khān of\r\nthe Mughūls in the camping ground (_yūrt_) of his ancestor, Chaghatāī\r\nKhān, the second son of Chīngīz Khān. Each time the Mīrzā brought The\r\nKhān into the Farghāna country he gave him lands, but, partly owing to\r\nhis misconduct, partly to the thwarting of the [Sidenote: Fol. 6.]\r\nMughūls,[101] things did not go as he wished and Yūnas Khān, not being\r\nable to remain, went out again into Mughūlistān. When the Mīrzā last\r\nbrought The Khān in, he was in possession of Tāshkīnt, which in books\r\nthey write Shash, and sometimes Chāch, whence the term, a Chāchī,\r\nbow.[102] He gave it to The Khān, and from that date (890AH.-1485AD.)\r\ndown to 908AH. (1503AD.) it and the Shāhrukhiya country were held by the\r\nChaghatāī Khāns.\r\n\r\nAt this date (_i.e._, 899AH.-1494AD.) the Mughūl Khānship was in Sl.\r\nMaḥ=mūd Khān, Yūnas Khān's younger son and a half-brother of my mother.\r\nAs he and `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's elder brother, the then ruler of\r\nSamarkand, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā were offended by the Mīrzā's behaviour, they\r\ncame to an agreement together; Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā had already given a\r\ndaughter to Sl. Maḥmūd Khān;[103] both now led their armies against\r\n`Umar Shaikh Mīrzā, the first advancing along the south of the Khujand\r\nWater, the second along its north.\r\n\r\nMeantime a strange event occurred. It has been mentioned [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n6b] that the fort of Akhsī is situated above a deep ravine;[104] along\r\nthis ravine stand the palace buildings, and from it, on Monday, Ramẓān\r\n4, (June 8th.) `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā flew, with his pigeons and their\r\nhouse, and became a falcon.[105]\r\n\r\nHe was 39 (lunar) years old, having been born in Samarkand, in 860AH.\r\n(1456AD.) He was Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā's fourth son,[106] being younger\r\nthan Sl. Aḥmad M. and Sl. Muḥammad M. and Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā. His father,\r\nSl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā, was the son of Sl. Muḥammad Mīrzā, son of Tīmūr\r\nBeg's third son, Mīrān-shāh M. and was younger than `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā,\r\n(the elder) and Jahāngīr M. but older than Shāhrukh Mīrzā.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's country._\r\n\r\nHis father first gave him Kābul and, with Bābā-i-Kābulī[107] for his\r\nguardian, had allowed him to set out, but recalled him from the Tamarisk\r\nValley[108] to Samarkand, on account of the Mīrzās' Circumcision Feast.\r\nWhen the Feast was over, he gave him Andijān with the appropriateness\r\nthat Tīmūr Beg had given Farghāna (Andijān) to his son, the elder `Umar\r\nShaikh Mīrzā. This done, he sent him off with Khudāī-bīrdī _Tūghchī\r\nTīmūr-tāsh_[109] for his guardian.\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. His appearance and characteristics._\r\n\r\nHe was a short and stout, round-bearded and fleshy-faced [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n7.] person.[110] He used to wear his tunic so very tight that to fasten\r\nthe strings he had to draw his belly in and, if he let himself out after\r\ntying them, they often tore away. He was not choice in dress or food. He\r\nwound his turban in a fold (_dastar-pech_); all turbans were in four\r\nfolds (_chār-pech_) in those days; people wore them without twisting\r\nand let the ends hang down.[111] In the heats and except in his Court,\r\nhe generally wore the Mughūl cap.\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. His qualities and habits._\r\n\r\nHe was a true believer (_Ḥanafī maẕhablīk_) and pure in the Faith, not\r\nneglecting the Five Prayers and, his life through, making up his\r\nOmissions.[112] He read the Qur'ān very frequently and was a disciple of\r\nhis Highness Khwāja `Ubaidu'l-lāh (_Aḥrārī_) who honoured him by visits\r\nand even called him son. His current readings[113] were the two Quintets\r\nand the _Mas̤nawī_;[114] of histories he read chiefly the _Shāh-nāma_.\r\nHe had a poetic nature, but no taste for composing verses. He was so\r\njust that when he heard of a caravan returning from Khitāī as\r\noverwhelmed by snow in the mountains of Eastern Andijān,[115] and that\r\nof its thousand heads of houses (_awīlūq_) two only had escaped, he sent\r\nhis overseers to take charge of all goods and, though no heirs were\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 7b.] near and though he was in want himself, summoned\r\nthe heirs from Khurāsān and Samarkand, and in the course of a year or\r\ntwo had made over to them all their property safe and sound.\r\n\r\nHe was very generous; in truth, his character rose altogether to the\r\nheight of generosity. He was affable, eloquent and sweet-spoken, daring\r\nand bold. Twice out-distancing all his braves,[116] he got to work with\r\nhis own sword, once at the Gate of Akhsī, once at the Gate of\r\nShāhrukhiya. A middling archer, he was strong in the fist,—not a man but\r\nfell to his blow. Through his ambition, peace was exchanged often for\r\nwar, friendliness for hostility.\r\n\r\nIn his early days he was a great drinker, later on used to have a party\r\nonce or twice a week. He was good company, on occasions reciting verses\r\nadmirably. Towards the last he rather preferred intoxicating\r\nconfects[117] and, under their sway, used to lose his head. His\r\ndisposition[118] was amorous, and he bore many a lover's mark.[119] He\r\nplayed draughts a good deal, sometimes even threw the dice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_f. His battles and encounters._\r\n\r\nHe fought three ranged battles, the first with Yūnas Khān, [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 8.] on the Saiḥūn, north of Andijān, at the Goat-leap,[120] a\r\nvillage so-called because near it the foot-hills so narrow the flow of\r\nthe water that people say goats leap across.[121] There he was beaten\r\nand made prisoner. Yūnas Khān for his part did well by him and gave him\r\nleave to go to his own district (Andijān). This fight having been at\r\nthat place, the Battle of the Goat-leap became a date in those parts.\r\n\r\nHis second battle was fought on the Urūs,[122] in Turkistān, with\r\nAūzbegs returning from a raid near Samarkand. He crossed the river on\r\nthe ice, gave them a good beating, separated off all their prisoners and\r\nbooty and, without coveting a single thing for himself, gave everything\r\nback to its owners.\r\n\r\nHis third battle he fought with (his brother) Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā at a\r\nplace between Shāhrukhiya and Aūrā-tīpā, named Khwāṣ.[123] Here he was\r\nbeaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n_g. His country._\r\n\r\nThe Farghāna country his father had given him; Tāshkīnt and Sairām, his\r\nelder brother, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā gave, and they were in his possession for\r\na time; Shāhrukhiya he took by a ruse and held awhile. Later on,\r\nTāshkīnt and Shāhrukhiya passed out of his hands; there then remained\r\nthe Farghāna country and Khujand,—some do not include Khujand in\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 8b.] Farghāna,—and Aūrā-tīpā, of which the original name\r\nwas Aūrūshnā and which some call Aūrūsh. In Aūrā-tīpā, at the time Sl.\r\nAḥmad Mīrzā went to Tāshkīnt against the Mughūls, and was beaten on the\r\nChīr[124] (893AH.-1488AD.) was Ḥafiẓ Beg _Dūldāī_; he made it over to\r\n`Umar Shaikh M. and the Mīrzā held it from that time forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_h. His children._\r\n\r\nThree of his sons and five of his daughters grew up. I, Z̤ahīru'd-dīn\r\nMuḥammad Bābur,[125] was his eldest son; my mother was Qūtlūq-nigār\r\nKhānīm. Jahāngīr Mīrzā was his second son, two years younger than I; his\r\nmother, Fāṯima-sulṯān by name, was of the Mughūl _tūmān_-begs.[126]\r\nNāṣir Mīrzā was his third son; his mother was an Andijānī, a\r\nmistress,[127] named Umīd. He was four years younger than I.\r\n\r\n`Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's eldest daughter was Khān-zāda Begīm,[128] my full\r\nsister, five years older than I. The second time I took Samarkand\r\n(905AH.-1500AD.), spite of defeat at Sar-i-pul,[129] I went back and\r\nheld it through a five months' siege, but as no sort of help or\r\nreinforcement came from any beg or ruler thereabouts, I left it in\r\ndespair and got away; in that throneless time (_fatrat_) Khān-zāda Begīm\r\nfell[130] to Muḥammad _Shaibānī_ Khān. She had one child by him, a\r\npleasant boy,[131] [Sidenote: Fol. 9.] named Khurram Shāh. The Balkh\r\ncountry was given to him; he went to God's mercy a few years after the\r\ndeath of his father (916AH.-1510AD.). Khān-zāda Begīm was in Merv when\r\nShāh Ismā`īl (_Ṣafawī_) defeated the Aūzbegs near that town\r\n(916AH.-1510AD.); for my sake he treated her well, giving her a\r\nsufficient escort to Qūndūz where she rejoined me. We had been apart for\r\nsome ten years; when Muḥammadī _kūkūldāsh_ and I went to see her,\r\nneither she nor those about her knew us, although I spoke. They\r\nrecognized us after a time.\r\n\r\nMihr-bānū Begīm was another daughter, Nāṣir Mīrzā's full-sister, two\r\nyears younger than I. Shahr-bānū Begīm was another, also Nāṣir Mīrzā's\r\nfull-sister, eight years younger than I. Yādgār-sulṯān Begīm was\r\nanother, her mother was a mistress, called Āghā-sulṯān. Ruqaiya-sulṯān\r\nBegīm was another; her mother, Makhdūm-sulṯān Begīm, people used to call\r\nthe Dark-eyed Begīm. The last-named two were born after the Mīrzā's\r\ndeath. Yādgār-sulṯān Begīm was brought up by my grandmother,\r\nAīsān-daulat Begīm; she fell to `Abdu'l-laṯīf Sl., a son of Ḥamza Sl.\r\nwhen Shaibānī Khān took Andijān and Akhsī (908AH.-1503AD.). She rejoined\r\nme when (917AH.-1511AD.) in Khutlān I defeated Ḥamza Sl. and other\r\nsulṯāns and took Ḥiṣār. Ruqaiya-sulṯān Begīm fell in that [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 9b.] same throneless time (_fatrat_) to Jānī Beg Sl. (_Aūzbeg_). By\r\nhim she had one or two children who did not live. In these days of our\r\nleisure (_furṣatlār_)[132] has come news that she has gone to God's\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_i. His ladies and mistresses._\r\n\r\nQūtlūq-nigār Khānīm was the second daughter of Yūnas Khān and the eldest\r\n(half-) sister of Sl. Maḥmūd Khān and Sl. Aḥmad Khān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Interpolated account of Bābur's mother's family._)\r\n\r\nYūnas Khān descended from Chaghatāī Khān, the second son of Chīngīz Khān\r\n(as follows,) Yūnas Khān, son of Wais Khān, son of Sher-`alī _Aūghlān_,\r\nson of Muḥammad Khān, son of Khiẓr Khwāja Khān, son of Tūghlūq-tīmūr\r\nKhān, son of Aīsān-būghā Khān, son of Dāwā Khān, son of Barāq Khān, son\r\nof Yīsūntawā Khān, son of Mūātūkān, son of Chaghatāī Khān, son of\r\nChīngīz Khān.\r\n\r\nSince such a chance has come, set thou down[133] now a summary of the\r\nhistory of the Khāns.\r\n\r\nYūnas Khān (d. 892 AH.-1487 AD.) and Aīsān-būghā Khān (d. 866 AH.-1462\r\nAD.) were sons of Wais Khān (d. 832 AH.-1428 AD.).[134] Yūnas Khān's\r\nmother was either a daughter or a grand-daughter of Shaikh Nūru'd-dīn\r\nBeg, a Turkistānī Qīpchāq favoured by Tīmūr Beg. When Wais Khān died,\r\nthe Mughūl horde split in two, one portion being for Yūnas Khān, the\r\ngreater for Aīsān-būghā Khān. For help in getting the upper hand in the\r\nhorde, Aīrzīn (var. Aīrāzān) one of the Bārīn _tūmān_-begs and Beg Mīrik\r\n_Turkmān_, one of the Chīrās _tūmān_-begs, took Yūnas Khān (aet. 13) and\r\nwith him [Sidenote: Fol. 10.] three or four thousand Mughūl heads of\r\nhouses (_awīlūq_), to Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā (_Shāhrukhī_) with the\r\nfittingness that Aūlūgh Beg M. had taken Yūnas Khān's elder sister for\r\nhis son, `Abdu'l-`azīz Mīrzā. Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā did not do well by them;\r\nsome he imprisoned, some scattered over the country[135] one by one. The\r\nDispersion of Aīrzīn became a date in the Mughūl horde.\r\n\r\nYūnas Khān himself was made to go towards `Irāq; one year he spent in\r\nTabrīz where Jahān Shāh _Barānī_ of the Black Sheep Turkmāns was ruling.\r\nFrom Tabrīz he went to Shīrāz where was Shāhrukh Mīrzā's second son,\r\nIbrāhīm Sulṯān Mīrzā.[136] He having died five or six months later\r\n(Shawwal 4, 838 AH.-May 3rd, 1435 AD.), his son, `Abdu'l-lāh Mīrzā sat\r\nin his place. Of this `Abdu'l-lāh Mīrzā Yūnas Khān became a retainer and\r\nto him used to pay his respects. The Khān was in those parts for 17 or\r\n18 years.\r\n\r\nIn the disturbances between Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā and his sons, Aīsān-būghā\r\nKhān found a chance to invade Farghāna; he plundered as far as\r\nKand-i-badām, came on and, having plundered Andijān, led all its people\r\ninto captivity.[137] Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā, after seizing the throne of\r\nSamarkand, led an army out to beyond Yāngī (Tarāz) to Aspara in\r\nMughūlistān, [Sidenote: Fol. 10b.] there gave Aīsān-būghā a good beating\r\nand then, to spare himself further trouble from him and with the\r\nfittingness that he had just taken to wife[138] Yūnas Khān's elder\r\nsister, the former wife of `Abdu'l-`azīz Mīrzā (_Shāhrukhī_), he invited\r\nYūnas Khān from Khurāsān and `Irāq, made a feast, became friends and\r\nproclaimed him Khān of the Mughūls. Just when he was speeding him forth,\r\nthe Sāghārīchī _tūmān_-begs had all come into Mughūlistān, in anger with\r\nAīsān-būghā Khān.[139] Yūnas Khān went amongst them and took to wife\r\nAīsān-daulat Begīm, the daughter of their chief, `Alī-shīr Beg. They\r\nthen seated him and her on one and the same white felt and raised him to\r\nthe Khānship.[140]\r\n\r\nBy this Aīsān-daulat Begīm, Yūnas Khān had three daughters. Mihr-nigār\r\nKhānīm was the eldest; Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā set her aside[141] for his\r\neldest son, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā; she had no child. In a throneless time (905\r\nAH.) she fell to Shaibānī Khān; she left Samarkand[142] with Shāh Begīm\r\nfor Khurāsān (907 AH.) and both came on to me in Kābul (911 AH.). At the\r\ntime Shaibānī Khān was besieging Nāṣir Mīrzā in Qandahār and I set out\r\nfor Lamghān[143] (913 AH.) they went to Badakhshān with Khān Mīrzā\r\n(Wais).[144] When Mubārak Shāh invited Khān Mīrzā into Fort\r\nVictory,[145] they were [Sidenote: Fol. 11.] captured, together with the\r\nwives and families of all their people, by marauders of Ābā-bikr\r\n_Kāshgharī_ and, as captives to that ill-doing miscreant, bade farewell\r\nto this transitory world (_circa_ 913 AH.-1507 AD.).\r\n\r\nQūtlūq-nigār Khānīm, my mother, was Yūnas Khān's second daughter. She\r\nwas with me in most of my guerilla expeditions and throneless times. She\r\nwent to God's mercy in Muḥarram 911 AH. (June 1505 AD.) five or six\r\nmonths after the capture of Kābul.\r\n\r\nKhūb-nigār Khānīm was his third daughter. Her they gave to Muḥammad\r\nḤusain _Kūrkān Dūghlāt_ (899 AH.). She had one son and one daughter by\r\nhim. `Ubaid Khān (_Aūzbeg_) took the daughter (Ḥabība).[146] When I\r\ncaptured Samarkand and Bukhārā (917 AH.-1511 AD.), she stayed\r\nbehind,[147] and when her paternal uncle, Sayyid Muḥammad _Dūghlāt_ came\r\nas Sl. Sa`īd Khān's envoy to me in Samarkand, she joined him and with\r\nhim went to Kāshghar where (her cousin), Sl. Sa`īd Khān took her.\r\nKhūb-nigār's son was Ḥaidar Mīrzā.[148] He was in my service for three\r\nor four years after the Aūzbegs slew his father, then (918 AH.-1512 AD.)\r\nasked leave to go to Kāshghar to the presence of Sl. Sa`īd Khān.\r\n\r\n   \"Everything goes back to its source.\r\n    Pure gold, or silver or tin.\"[149]\r\n\r\nPeople say he now lives lawfully (_tā'ib_) and has found the right way\r\n(_ṯarīqā_).[150] He has a hand deft in everything, penmanship and\r\npainting, and in making arrows and arrow-barbs [Sidenote: Fol. 11b.] and\r\nstring-grips; moreover he is a born poet and in a petition written to\r\nme, even his style is not bad.[151]\r\n\r\nShāh Begīm was another of Yūnas Khān's ladies. Though he had more, she\r\nand Aīsān-daulat Begīm were the mothers of his children. She was one of\r\nthe (six) daughters of Shāh Sulṯān Muḥammad, Shāh of Badakhshān.[152]\r\nHis line, they say, runs back to Iskandar Fīlkūs.[153] Sl. Abū-sa`īd\r\nMīrzā took another daughter and by her had Ābā-bikr Mīrzā.[154] By this\r\nShāh Begīm Yūnas Khān had two sons and two daughters. Her first-born\r\nbut younger than all Aīsān-daulat Begīm's daughters, was Sl. Maḥmūd\r\nKhān, called Khānika Khān[155] by many in and about Samarkand. Next\r\nyounger than he was Sl. Aḥmad Khān, known as Alacha Khān. People say he\r\nwas called this because he killed many Qālmāqs on the several occasions\r\nhe beat them. In the Mughūl and Qālmāq tongues, one who will kill\r\n(_aūltūrgūchī_) is called _ālāchī_; Alāchī they called him therefore and\r\nthis by repetition, became Alacha.[156] As occasion arises, the acts and\r\ncircumstances of these two Khāns will find mention in this history\r\n(_tārīkh_).\r\n\r\nSulṯān-nigār Khānīm was the youngest but one of Yūnas Khān's children.\r\nHer they made go forth (_chīqārīb īdīlār_) [Sidenote: Fol. 12.] to Sl.\r\nMaḥmūd Mīrzā; by him she had one child, Sl. Wais (Khān Mīrzā), mention\r\nof whom will come into this history. When Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā died (900\r\nAH.-1495 AD.), she took her son off to her brothers in Tāshkīnt without\r\na word to any single person. They, a few years later, gave her to Adik\r\n(Aūng) Sulṯān,[157] a Qāzāq sulṯān of the line of Jūjī Khān, Chīngīz\r\nKhān's eldest son. When Shaibānī Khān defeated the Khāns (her brothers),\r\nand took Tāshkīnt and Shāhrukhiya (908 AH.), she got away with 10 or 12\r\nof her Mughūl servants, to (her husband), Adik Sulṯān. She had two\r\ndaughters by Adik Sulṯān; one she gave to a Shaibān sulṯān, the other to\r\nRashīd Sulṯān, the son of (her cousin) Sl. Sa`īd Khān. After Adik\r\nSulṯān's death, (his brother), Qāsim Khān, Khān of the Qāzāq horde, took\r\nher.[158] Of all the Qāzāq khāns and sulṯāns, no one, they say, ever\r\nkept the horde in such good order as he; his army was reckoned at\r\n300,000 men. On his death the Khānīm went to Sl. Sa`īd Khān's presence\r\nin Kāshghar. Daulat-sulṯān Khānīm was Yūnas Khān's youngest child.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 12b.] In the Tāshkīnt disaster (908 AH.) she fell to\r\nTīmūr Sulṯān, the son of Shaibānī Khān. By him she had one daughter;\r\nthey got out of Samarkand with me (918 AH.-1512 AD.), spent three or\r\nfour years in the Badakhshān country, then went (923 AH.-1420 AD.) to\r\nSl. Sa`īd Khān's presence in Kāshghar.[159]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Account resumed of Bābur's father's family._)\r\n\r\nIn `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's _ḥaram_ was also Aūlūs Āghā, a daughter of\r\nKhwāja Ḥusain Beg; her one daughter died in infancy and they sent her\r\nout of the _ḥaram_ a year or eighteen months later. Fāṯima-sulṯān Āghā\r\nwas another; she was of the Mughūl _tūmān_-begs and the first taken of\r\nhis wives. Qarāgūz (Makhdūm sulṯān) Begīm was another; the Mīrzā took\r\nher towards the end of his life; she was much beloved, so to please him,\r\nthey made her out descended from (his uncle) Minūchihr Mīrzā, the elder\r\nbrother of Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā. He had many mistresses and concubines;\r\none, Umīd Āghāchā died before him. Latterly there were also Tūn-sulṯān\r\n(var. Yun) of the Mughūls and Āghā Sulṯān.\r\n\r\n\r\n_l. `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's Amīrs._\r\n\r\nThere was Khudāī-bīrdī _Tūghchī Tīmūr-tāsh_, a descendant of the brother\r\nof Āq-būghā Beg, the Governor of Hīrī (Herāt, for Timūr Beg.) When Sl.\r\nAbū-sa`īd Mīrzā, after besieging Jūkī Mīrzā (_Shāhrukhī_) in Shāhrukhiya\r\n(868AH.-1464AD.) gave the Farghāna country to `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā, he put\r\nthis Khudāī-bīrdī [Sidenote: Fol. 13.] Beg at the head of the Mīrzā's\r\nGate.[160] Khudāī-bīrdī was then 25 but youth notwithstanding, his\r\nrules and management were very good indeed. A few years later when\r\nIbrāhīm _Begchīk_ was plundering near Aūsh, he followed him up, fought\r\nhim, was beaten and became a martyr. At the time, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā was in\r\nthe summer pastures of Āq Qāchghāī, in Aūrā-tīpā, 18 _yīghāch_ east of\r\nSamarkand, and Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā was at Bābā Khākī, 12 _yīghāch_ east\r\nof Hīrī. People sent the news post-haste to the Mīrzā(s),[161] having\r\nhumbly represented it through `Abdu'l-wahhāb _Shaghāwal_. In four days\r\nit was carried those 120 _yīghāch_ of road.[162]\r\n\r\nḤāfiẓ Muḥammad Beg _Dūldāī_ was another, Sl. Malik _Kāshgharī's_ son and\r\na younger brother of Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg. After the death of Khudāī-bīrdī\r\nBeg, they sent him to control `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's Gate, but he did not\r\nget on well with the Andijān begs and therefore, when Sl. Abū-sa`īd\r\nMīrzā died, went to Samarkand and took service with Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā. At\r\nthe time of the disaster on the Chīr, he was in Aūrā-tīpā and made it\r\nover to `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā when the Mīrzā passed through on his way to\r\nSamarkand, himself taking [Sidenote: Fol. 13b.] service with him. The\r\nMīrzā, for his part, gave him the Andijān Command. Later on he went to\r\nSl. Maḥmūd Khān in Tāshkīnt and was there entrusted with the\r\nguardianship of Khān Mīrzā (Wais) and given Dīzak. He had started for\r\nMakka by way of Hind before I took Kābul (910AH. Oct. 1504AD.), but he\r\nwent to God's mercy on the road. He was a simple person, of few words\r\nand not clever.\r\n\r\nKhwāja Ḥusain Beg was another, a good-natured and simple person. It is\r\nsaid that, after the fashion of those days, he used to improvise very\r\nwell at drinking parties.[163]\r\n\r\nShaikh Mazīd Beg was another, my first guardian, excellent in rule and\r\nmethod. He must have served (_khidmat qīlghān dūr_) under Bābur Mīrzā\r\n(_Shāhrukhī_). There was no greater beg in `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's\r\npresence. He was a vicious person and kept catamites.\r\n\r\n`Alī-mazīd _Qūchīn_ was another;[164] he rebelled twice, once at Akhsī,\r\nonce at Tāshkīnt. He was disloyal, untrue to his salt, vicious and\r\ngood-for-nothing.\r\n\r\nḤasan (son of) Yaq`ūb was another, a small-minded, good-tempered, smart\r\nand active man. This verse is his:—\r\n\r\n   \"Return, O Huma, for without the parrot-down of thy lip,\r\n    The crow will assuredly soon carry off my bones.\"[165]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 14.] He was brave, a good archer, played polo\r\n(_chaughān_) well and leapt well at leap-frog.[166] He had the control\r\nof my Gate after `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's accident. He had not much sense,\r\nwas narrow-minded and somewhat of a strife-stirrer.\r\n\r\nQāsim Beg _Qūchīn_, of the ancient army-begs of Andijān, was another. He\r\nhad the control of my Gate after Ḥasan Yaq`ūb Beg. His life through, his\r\nauthority and consequence waxed without decline. He was a brave man;\r\nonce he gave some Aūzbegs a good beating when he overtook them raiding\r\nnear Kāsān; his sword hewed away in `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's presence; and\r\nin the fight at the Broad Ford (Yāsī-kījīt _circa_ 904AH.-July, 1499AD.)\r\nhe hewed away with the rest. In the guerilla days he went to Khusrau\r\nShāh (907AH.) at the time I was planning to go from the Macha\r\nhill-country[167] to Sl. Maḥmūd Khān, but he came back to me in 910AH.\r\n(1504AD.) and I shewed him all my old favour and affection. When I\r\nattacked the Turkmān Hazāra raiders in Dara-i-khwush (911AH.) he made\r\nbetter advance, spite of his age, than the younger men; I gave him\r\nBangash as a reward and later on, after returning to Kābul, made him\r\nHumāyūn's guardian. He went to God's mercy [Sidenote: Fol. 14b.] about\r\nthe time Zamīn-dāwar was taken (_circa_ 928AH.-1522AD.). He was a pious,\r\nGod-fearing Musalmān, an abstainer from doubtful aliments; excellent in\r\njudgment and counsel, very facetious and, though he could neither read\r\nnor write (_ummiy_), used to make entertaining jokes.\r\n\r\nBābā Beg's Bābā Qulī (`Alī) was another, a descendant of Shaikh `Alī\r\n_Bahādur_.[168] They made him my guardian when Shaikh Mazīd Beg died. He\r\nwent over to Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā when the Mīrzā led his army against Andijān\r\n(899AH.), and gave him Aūrā-tīpā. After Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā's death, he\r\nleft Samarkand and was on his way to join me (900AH.) when Sl. `Alī\r\nMīrzā, issuing out of Aūrā-tīpā, fought, defeated and slew him. His\r\nmanagement and equipment were excellent and he took good care of his\r\nmen. He prayed not; he kept no fasts; he was like a heathen and he was a\r\ntyrant.\r\n\r\n`Alī-dost T̤aghāī[169] was another, one of the Sāghārīchī _tumān_-begs\r\nand a relation of my mother's mother, Aīsān-daulat Begīm. I favoured him\r\nmore than he had been favoured in `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's time. People\r\nsaid, \"Work will come from his hand.\" But in the many years he was\r\nin my presence, no work to speak of[170] came to sight. He must have\r\nserved Sl. [Sidenote: Fol. 15.] Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā. He claimed to have\r\npower to bring on rain with the jade-stone. He was the Falconer\r\n(_qūshchī_),worthless by nature and habit, a stingy, severe,\r\nstrife-stirring person, false, self-pleasing, rough of tongue and\r\ncold-of-face.\r\n\r\nWais _Lāgharī_,[171] one of the Samarkand _Tūghchī_ people, was another.\r\nLatterly he was much in `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's confidence; in the guerilla\r\ntimes he was with me. Though somewhat factious, he was a man of good\r\njudgment and counsel.\r\n\r\nMīr Ghiyās̤ T̤aghāi was another, a younger brother of `Ali-dost T̤aghāī.\r\nNo man amongst the leaders in Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā's Gate was more to the\r\nfront than he; he had charge of the Mīrzā's square seal[172] and was\r\nmuch in his confidence latterly. He was a friend of Wais _Lāgharī_. When\r\nKāsān had been given to Sl. Maḥmūd Khān (899AH.-1494AD. ), he was\r\ncontinuously in The Khān's service and was in high favour. He was a\r\nlaugher, a joker and fearless in vice.\r\n\r\n`Ali-darwesh _Khurāsānī_ was another. He had served in the Khurāsān\r\nCadet Corps, one of two special corps of serviceable young men formed by\r\nSl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā when he first began [Sidenote: Fol. 15b.] to arrange\r\nthe government of Khurāsān and Samarkand, and, presumably, called by him\r\nthe Khurāsān Corps and the Samarkand Corps. `Alī-darwesh was a brave\r\nman; he did well in my presence at the Gate of Bīshkārān.[173] He wrote\r\nthe _naskh ta`līq_ hand clearly.[174] His was the flatterer's tongue and\r\nin his character avarice was supreme.\r\n\r\nQaṃbar-`alī _Mughūl_ of the Equerries (_akhtachī_) was another. People\r\ncalled him The Skinner because his father, on first coming into the\r\n(Farghāna) country, worked as a skinner. Qaṃbar-`alī had been Yūnas\r\nKhān's water-bottle bearer,[175] later on he became a beg. Till he was a\r\nmade man, his conduct was excellent; once arrived, he was slack. He was\r\nfull of talk and of foolish talk,—a great talker is sure to be a foolish\r\none,—his capacity was limited and his brain muddy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Historical narrative._)\r\n\r\nAt the time of `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's accident, I was in the Four Gardens\r\n(_Chār-bāgh_) of Andijān.[176] The news reached Andijān on Tuesday,\r\nRamẓan 5 (June 9th); I mounted at once, with my followers and retainers,\r\nintending to go into the fort but, on our getting near the Mīrzā's Gate,\r\nShīrīm T̤aghāī[177] took hold of my bridle and moved off towards the\r\nPraying Place.[178] It had crossed his mind that if a great ruler like\r\nSl. Aḥmad Mīrzā came in force, the Andijān begs would make over to him\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 16.] me and the country,[179] but that if he took me to\r\nAūzkīnt and the foothills thereabouts, I, at any rate, should not be\r\nmade over and could go to one of my mother's (half-) brothers, Sl.\r\nMaḥmūd Khān or Sl. Aḥmad Khān.[180] When Khwāja Maulānā-i-qāẓī[181] and\r\nthe begs in the fort heard of (the intended departure), they sent after\r\nus Khwāja Muḥammad, the tailor,[184] an old servant (_bāyrī_) of my\r\nfather and the foster-father of one of his daughters. He dispelled our\r\nfears and, turning back from near the Praying [Sidenote: Fol. 16b.]\r\nPlace, took me with him into the citadel (_ark_) where I dismounted.\r\nKhwāja Maulānā-i-qāẓī and the begs came to my presence there and after\r\nbringing their counsels to a head,[185] busied themselves in making good\r\nthe towers and ramparts of the fort.[186] A few days later, Ḥasan, son\r\nof Yaq`ūb, and Qāsim _Qūchīn_, arrived, together with other begs who had\r\nbeen sent to reconnoitre in Marghīnān and those parts.[187] They also,\r\nafter waiting on me, set themselves with one heart and mind and with\r\nzeal and energy, to hold the fort.\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on Khwāja Maulānā-i-qāẓī._) He was the son of\r\n   Sl. Aḥmad Qāẓī, of the line of Burhānu'd-dīn `Alī\r\n   _Qīlīch_[182] and through his mother, traced back to Sl. Aīlīk\r\n   _Māẓī_.[183] By hereditary right (_yūsūnlūq_) his high family\r\n   (_khānwādalār_) must have come to be the Refuge (_marji`_) and\r\n   Pontiffs (_Shaikhu'l-islām_) of the (Farghāna) country.\r\n\r\nMeantime Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā took Aūrā-tīpā, Khujand and Marghīnān, came on\r\nto Qabā,[188] 4 _yīghāch_ from Andijān and there made halt. At this\r\ncrisis, Darwesh Gau, one of the Andijān notables, was put to death on\r\naccount of his improper proposals; his punishment crushed the rest.\r\n\r\nKhwāja Qāẓī and Aūzūn (Long) Ḥasan,[189] (brother) of Khwāja Ḥusain,\r\nwere then sent to Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā to say in effect that, as he himself\r\nwould place one of his servants in the country and as I was myself both\r\na servant and (as) a son, he would attain his end most readily and\r\neasily if he entrusted the service to me. He was a mild, weak man, of\r\nfew words who, without his begs, decided no opinion or compact (_aun_),\r\naction or move; they paid attention to our proposal, gave it a harsh\r\nanswer and moved forward.\r\n\r\nBut the Almighty God, who, of His perfect power and without mortal aid,\r\nhas ever brought my affairs to their right issue, made such things\r\nhappen here that they became disgusted at having advanced (_i.e._ from\r\nQabā), repented indeed that they had ever set out on this expedition and\r\nturned back with nothing done.\r\n\r\nOne of those things was this: Qabā has a stagnant, morass-like\r\nWater,[190] passable only by the bridge. As they were many, there was\r\ncrowding on the bridge and numbers of horses and [Sidenote: Fol. 17.]\r\ncamels were pushed off to perish in the water. This disaster recalling\r\nthe one they had had three or four years earlier when they were badly\r\nbeaten at the passage of the Chīr, they gave way to fear. Another thing\r\nwas that such a murrain broke out amongst their horses that, massed\r\ntogether, they began to die off in bands.[191] Another was that they\r\nfound in our soldiers and peasants a resolution and single-mindedness\r\nsuch as would not let them flinch from making offering of their\r\nlives[192] so long as there was breath and power in their bodies. Need\r\nbeing therefore, when one _yīghāch_ from Andijān, they sent Darwesh\r\nMuḥammad Tarkhān[193] to us; Ḥasan of Yaq'ūb went out from those in the\r\nfort; the two had an interview near the Praying Place and a sort of\r\npeace was made. This done, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā's force retired.\r\n\r\nMeantime Sl. Maḥmūd Khān had come along the north of the Khujand Water\r\nand laid siege to Akhsī.[194] In Akhsī was Jahāngīr Mīrzā (aet. 9) and\r\nof begs, `Alī-darwesh Beg, Mīrzā Qulī _Kūkūldāsh_, Muḥ. Bāqir Beg and\r\nShaikh `Abdu'l-lāh, Lord of the Gate. Wais _Lāgharī_ and Mīr Ghiyās̤\r\nT̤aghāī had been there too, but being afraid of the (Akhsī) begs had\r\ngone off to Kāsān, Wais _Lāgharī's_ district, where, he being Nāṣir\r\nMīrzā's guardian, the Mīrzā was.[195] They went over to Sl. Maḥmūd Khān\r\nwhen he got near Akhsī; Mīr Ghiyās̤ entered his service; [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n17b.] Wais _Lāgharī_ took Nāṣir Mīrzā to Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā, who entrusted\r\nhim to Muh. Mazīd Tarkhān's charge. The Khān, though he fought several\r\ntimes near Akhsī, could not effect anything because the Akhsī begs and\r\nbraves made such splendid offering of their lives. Falling sick, being\r\ntired of fighting too, he returned to his own country (_i.e._ Tāshkīnt).\r\n\r\nFor some years, Ābā-bikr _Kāshgharī Dūghlāt_,[196] bowing the head to\r\nnone, had been supreme in Kāshgar and Khutan. He now, moved like the\r\nrest by desire for my country, came to the neighbourhood of Aūzkīnt,\r\nbuilt a fort and began to lay the land waste. Khwāja Qāzī and several\r\nbegs were appointed to drive him out. When they came near, he saw\r\nhimself no match for such a force, made the Khwāja his mediator and, by\r\na hundred wiles and tricks, got himself safely free.\r\n\r\nThroughout these great events, `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's former begs and\r\nbraves had held resolutely together and made daring offer of their\r\nlives. The Mīrzā's mother, Shāh Sulṯān Begīm,[197] and Jaḥāngīr Mīrzā\r\nand the _ḥaram_ household and the begs came from Akhsī to Andijān; the\r\ncustomary mourning was fulfilled and food and victuals spread for the\r\npoor and destitute.[198]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 18.] In the leisure from these important matters,\r\nattention was given to the administration of the country and the\r\nordering of the army. The Andijān Government and control of my Gate were\r\nsettled (_mukarrar_) for Ḥasan (son) of Yaq'ūb; Aūsh was decided on\r\n(_qarār_) for Qāsim _Qūchīn_; Akhsī and Marghīnān assigned (_ta'īn_) to\r\nAūzun Ḥasan and `Alī-dost T̤aghāī. For the rest of `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā's\r\nbegs and braves, to each according to his circumstances, were settled\r\nand assigned district (_wilāyat_) or land (_yīr_) or office (_mauja_) or\r\ncharge (_jīrga_) or stipend (_wajh_).\r\n\r\nWhen Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā had gone two or three stages on his return-march,\r\nhis health changed for the worse and high fever appeared. On his\r\nreaching the Āq Sū near Aūrā-tīpā, he bade farewell to this transitory\r\nworld, in the middle of Shawwāl of the date 899 (mid July 1494 AD.)\r\nbeing then 44 (lunar) years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n_m. Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā's birth and descent._\r\n\r\nHe was born in 855 AH. (1451 AD.) the year in which his father took the\r\nthrone (_i.e._ Samarkand). He was Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā's eldest son; his\r\nmother was a daughter of Aūrdū-būghā Tarkhān (_Arghūn_), the elder\r\nsister of Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān, and the most honoured of the Mīrzā's\r\nwives.\r\n\r\n\r\n_n. His appearance and habits._\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, stout, brown-bearded and red-faced man. He had beard on\r\nhis chin but none on his cheeks. He had very [Sidenote: Fol. 18b.]\r\npleasing manners. As was the fashion in those days, he wound his turban\r\nin four folds and brought the end forward over his brows.\r\n\r\n\r\n_o. His characteristics and manners._\r\n\r\nHe was a True Believer, pure in the Faith; five times daily, without\r\nfail, he recited the Prayers, not omitting them even on drinking-days.\r\nHe was a disciple of his Highness Khwāja `Ubaidu'l-lāh (_Aḥrārī_), his\r\ninstructor in religion and the strengthener of his Faith. He was very\r\nceremonious, particularly when sitting with the Khwāja. People say he\r\nnever drew one knee over the other[199] at any entertainment of the\r\nKhwāja. On one occasion contrary to his custom, he sat with his feet\r\ntogether. When he had risen, the Khwāja ordered the place he had sat in\r\nto be searched; there they found, it may have been, a bone.[200] He had\r\nread nothing whatever and was ignorant (_`amī_), and though town-bred,\r\nunmannered and homely. Of genius he had no share. He was just and as his\r\nHighness the Khwāja was there, accompanying him step by step,[201] most\r\nof his affairs found lawful settlement. He was true and faithful to his\r\nvow and word; nothing was ever seen to the contrary. He had courage, and\r\nthough he never happened to get in his own hand to work, gave sign of\r\nit, they say, in some of his encounters. [Sidenote: Fol. 19.] He drew a\r\ngood bow, generally hitting the duck[202] both with his arrows (_aūq_)\r\nand his forked-arrows (_tīr-giz_), and, as a rule, hit the gourd[203] in\r\nriding across the lists (_maidān_). Latterly, when he had grown stout,\r\nhe used to take quail and pheasant with the goshawks,[204] rarely\r\nfailing. A sportsman he was, hawking mostly and hawking well; since\r\nAūlūgh Beg Mīrzā, such a sporting _pādshāh_ had not been seen. He was\r\nextremely decorous; people say he used to hide his feet even in the\r\nprivacy of his family and amongst his intimates. Once settled down to\r\ndrink, he would drink for 20 or 30 days at a stretch; once risen, would\r\nnot drink again for another 20 or 30 days. He was a good drinker;[205]\r\non non-drinking days he ate without conviviality (_basīṯ_). Avarice was\r\ndominant in his character. He was kindly, a man of few words whose will\r\nwas in the hands of his begs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_p. His battles._\r\n\r\nHe fought four battles. The first was with Ni'mat _Arghūn_, Shaikh Jamāl\r\n_Arghūn's_ younger brother, at Āqār-tūzī, near Zamīn. This he won. The\r\nsecond was with `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā at Khwaṣ; this also he won. The third\r\naffair was when he encountered Sl. Maḥmūd Khān on the Chīr, near\r\nTāshkīnt [Sidenote: Fol. 19b.](895 AH.-1469 AD.). There was no real\r\nfighting, but some Mughūl plunderers coming up, by ones and twos, in his\r\nrear and laying hands on his baggage, his great army, spite of its\r\nnumbers, broke up without a blow struck, without an effort made,\r\nwithout a coming face to face, and its main body was drowned in the\r\nChīr.[206] His fourth affair was with Ḥaidar _Kūkūldāsh_ (_Mughūl_),\r\nnear Yār-yīlāq; here he won.\r\n\r\n\r\n_q. His country._\r\n\r\nSamarkand and Bukhārā his father gave him; Tāshkīnt and Sairām he took\r\nand held for a time but gave them to his younger brother, `Umar Shaikh\r\nMīrzā, after `Abdu'l-qadūs (_Dūghlāt_) slew Shaikh Jamāl (_Arghūn_);\r\nKhujand and Aūrātīpā were also for a time in his possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n_r. His children._\r\n\r\nHis two sons did not live beyond infancy. He had five daughters, four by\r\nQātāq Begīm.[207]\r\n\r\nRābi`a-sulṯān Begīm, known as the Dark-eyed Begīm, was his eldest. The\r\nMīrzā himself made her go forth to Sl. Maḥmūd Khān;[208] she had one\r\nchild, a nice little boy, called Bābā Khān. The Aūzbegs killed him and\r\nseveral others of age as unripe as his when they martyred (his father)\r\nThe Khān, in Khujand, (914 AH.-1508 AD.). At that time she fell to Jānī\r\nBeg Sulṯān (_Aūzbeg_). [Sidenote: Fol. 20.]\r\n\r\nṢāliḥa-sulṯān (Ṣalīqa) Begīm was his second daughter; people called her\r\nthe Fair Begīm. Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā, after her father's death, took her for\r\nhis eldest son, Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā and made the wedding feast (900 AH.).\r\nLater on she fell to the Kāshgharī with Shāh Begīm and Mihr-nigār\r\nKhānim.\r\n\r\n`Āyisha-sulṯān Begīm was the third. When I was five and went to\r\nSamarkand, they set her aside for me; in the guerilla times[209] she\r\ncame to Khujand and I took her (905 AH.); her one little daughter, born\r\nafter the second taking of Samarkand, went in a few days to God's mercy\r\nand she herself left me at the instigation of an older sister.\r\n\r\nSulṯānīm Begīm was the fourth daughter; Sl. `Alī Mīrzā took her; then\r\nTīmūr Sulṯān (_Aūzbeg_) took her and after him, Mahdī Sulṯān (_Aūzbeg_).\r\n\r\nMa`sūma-sulṯān Begīm was the youngest of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā's daughters.\r\nHer mother, Ḥabība-sulṯān Begīm, was of the Arghūns, a daughter of Sl.\r\nḤusain _Arghūn's_ brother. I saw her when I went to Khurāsān (912\r\nAH.-1506 AD.), liked her, asked for her, had her brought to Kābul and\r\ntook her (913 AH.-1507 AD.). She had one daughter and there and then,\r\nwent to God's mercy, through the pains of the birth. Her name was at\r\nonce given to her child.\r\n\r\n\r\n_s. His ladies and mistresses._\r\n\r\nMihr-nigār Khānīm was his first wife, set aside for him by his father,\r\nSl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā. She was Yūnas Khān's eldest [Sidenote: Fol. 20b.]\r\ndaughter and my mother's full-sister.\r\n\r\nTarkhān Begīm of the Tarkhāns was another of his wives.\r\n\r\nQātāq Begīm was another, the foster-sister of the Tarkhān Begīm just\r\nmentioned. Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā took her _par amours_ (_`āshiqlār bīlā_): she\r\nwas loved with passion and was very dominant. She drank wine. During the\r\ndays of her ascendancy (_tīrīklīk_), he went to no other of his _ḥaram_;\r\nat last he took up a proper position (_aūlnūrdī_) and freed himself from\r\nhis reproach.[210]\r\n\r\nKhān-zāda Begīm, of the Tīrmīẕ Khāns, was another. He had just taken her\r\nwhen I went, at five years old, to Samarkand; her face was still veiled\r\nand, as is the Turkī custom, they told me to uncover it.[211]\r\n\r\nLaṯīf Begīm was another, a daughter's child of Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg _Dūldāī_\r\n(_Barlās_). After the Mīrzā's death, Ḥamza Sl. took her and she had\r\nthree sons by him. They with other sulṯāns' children, fell into my hands\r\nwhen I took Ḥiṣār (916 AH.-1510 AD.) after defeating Ḥamza Sulṯān and\r\nTīmūr Sulṯān. I set all free.\r\n\r\nḤabība-sulṯān Begīm was another, a daughter of the brother of Sl. Ḥusain\r\n_Arghūn_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_t. His amīrs._\r\n\r\nJānī Beg _Dūldāī_ (_Barlās_) was a younger brother of Sl. Malik\r\n_Kāshgharī_. Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā gave him the Government of Samarkand\r\nand Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā gave him the control of his own Gate.[212] He must\r\nhave had singular habits and [Sidenote: Fol. 21.] manners;[213] many\r\nstrange stories are told about him. One is this:—While he was Governor\r\nin Samarkand, an envoy came to him from the Aūzbegs renowned, as it\r\nwould seem, for his strength. An Aūzbeg, is said to call a strong man a\r\nbull (_būkuh_). \"Are you a _būkuh_?\" said Jānī Beg to the envoy, \"If you\r\nare, come, let's have a friendly wrestle together (_kūrāshālīng_).\"\r\nWhatever objections the envoy raised, he refused to accept. They\r\nwrestled and Jānī Beg gave the fall. He was a brave man.\r\n\r\nAḥmad Ḥājī (_Dūldāī Barlās_) was another, a son of Sl. Malik\r\n_Kāshgharī_. Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā gave him the Government of Hīrī (Harāt)\r\nfor a time but sent him when his uncle, Jānī Beg died, to Samarkand\r\nwith his uncle's appointments. He was pleasant-natured and brave. Wafā'ī\r\nwas his pen-name and he put together a dīwān in verse not bad. This\r\ncouplet is his:\r\n\r\n   \"I am drunk, Inspector, to-day keep your hand off me,\r\n   \"Inspect me on the day you catch me sober.\"\r\n\r\nMīr `Alī-sher Nāwā'ī when he went from Hīrī to Samarkand, was with Aḥmad\r\nḤājī Beg but he went back to Hīrī when Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā (Bāī-qarā)\r\nbecame supreme (873 AH.-1460 AD.) and he there received exceeding\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 21b.] Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg kept and rode excellent\r\n_tīpūchāqs_,[214] mostly of his own breeding. Brave he was but his power\r\nto command did not match his courage; he was careless and what was\r\nnecessary in his affairs, his retainers and followers put through. He\r\nfell into Sl. `Alī Mīrzā's hands when the Mīrzā defeated Bāī-sunghar\r\nMīrzā in Bukhārā (901 AH.), and was then put to a dishonourable death on\r\nthe charge of the blood of Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān.[215]\r\n\r\nDarwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān (_Arghūn_) was another, the son of Aūrdū-būghā\r\nTarkhān and full-brother of the mother of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā and Sl. Maḥmūd\r\nMīrzā.[216] Of all begs in Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā's presence, he was the\r\ngreatest and most honoured. He was an orthodox Believer, kindly and\r\ndarwesh-like, and was a constant transcriber of the Qu'rān.[217] He\r\nplayed chess often and well, thoroughly understood the science of\r\nfowling and flew his birds admirably. He died in the height of his\r\ngreatness, with a bad name, during the troubles between Sl. `Alī Mīrzā\r\nand Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā.[218]\r\n\r\n`Abdu'l-`alī Tarkhān was another, a near relation of Darwesh Muḥammad\r\nTarkhān, possessor also of his younger sister,[219] that is to say, Bāqī\r\nTarkhān's mother. Though both by the Mughūl rule (_tūrā_) and by his\r\nrank, Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān was the superior of `Abdu'l-`alī\r\nTarkhān, this Pharoah regarded him not at all. For some years he had the\r\nGovernment of Bukhārā. His retainers were reckoned at [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n22.] 3,000 and he kept them well and handsomely. His gifts\r\n(_bakhshīsh_), his visits of enquiry (_purshīsh_), his public audience\r\n(_dīwān_), his work-shops (_dast-gāh_), his open-table (_shīlān_) and\r\nhis assemblies (_majlis_) were all like a king's. He was a strict\r\ndisciplinarian, a tyrannical, vicious, self-infatuated person. Shaibānī\r\nKhān, though not his retainer, was with him for a time; most of the\r\nlesser (Shaibān) sulṯāns did themselves take service with him. This same\r\n`Abdu'l-`alī Tarkhān was the cause of Shaibānī Khān's rise to such a\r\nheight and of the downfall of such ancient dynasties.[220]\r\n\r\nSayyid Yūsuf, the Grey Wolfer[221] was another; his grandfather will\r\nhave come from the Mughūl horde; his father was favoured by Aūlūgh Beg\r\nMīrzā (_Shāhrukhī_). His judgment and counsel were excellent; he had\r\ncourage too. He played well on the guitar (_qūbuz_). He was with me when\r\nI first went to Kābul; I shewed him great favour and in truth he was\r\nworthy of favour. I left him in Kābul the first year the army rode out\r\nfor Hindūstān; at that time he went to God's mercy.[222]\r\n\r\nDarwesh Beg was another; he was of the line of Aīku-tīmūr Beg,[223] a\r\nfavourite of Tīmūr Beg. He was a disciple of his Highness Khwāja\r\n`Ubaidu'l-lāh (_Aḥrārī_), had knowledge of the science of music, played\r\nseveral instruments and was naturally [Sidenote: Fol. 22b.] disposed to\r\npoetry. He was drowned in the Chīr at the time of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā's\r\ndiscomfiture.\r\n\r\nMuḥammad Mazīd Tarkhān was another, a younger full-brother of Darwesh\r\nMuḥ. Tarkhān. He was Governor in Turkistān for some years till Shaibānī\r\nKhān took it from him. His judgment and counsel were excellent; he was\r\nan unscrupulous and vicious person. The second and third times I took\r\nSamarkand, he came to my presence and each time I shewed him very great\r\nfavour. He died in the fight at Kūl-i-malik (918 AH.-1512 AD.).\r\n\r\nBāqī Tarkhān was another, the son of `Abdu'l-`alī Tarkhān and Sl. Aḥmad\r\nMīrzā's aunt. When his father died, they gave him Bukhārā. He grew in\r\ngreatness under Sl. `Alī Mīrzā, his retainers numbering 5 or 6,000. He\r\nwas neither obedient nor very submissive to Sl. `Alī Mīrzā. He fought\r\nShaibānī Khān at Dabūsī (905 AH.) and was crushed; by the help of this\r\ndefeat, Shaibānī Khān went and took Bukhārā. He was very fond of\r\nhawking; they say he kept 700 birds. His manners and habits were not\r\nsuch as may be told;[224] he grew up with a Mīrzā's state and splendour.\r\nBecause his father had shewn favour to Shaibānī Khān, he went to the\r\nKhān's presence, but that inhuman ingrate made him no sort of return in\r\nfavour and kindness. [Sidenote: Fol. 23.] He left the world at Akhsī, in\r\nmisery and wretchedness.\r\n\r\nSl. Ḥusain _Arghūn_ was another. He was known as Qarā-kūlī because he\r\nhad held the Qarā-kūl government for a time. His judgment and counsel\r\nwere excellent; he was long in my presence also.\r\n\r\nQulī Muḥammad _Būghdā_[225] was another, a _qūchīn_; he must have been a\r\nbrave man.\r\n\r\n`Abdu'l-karīm _Ishrit_[226] was another; he was an Aūīghūr, Sl. Aḥmad\r\nMīrzā's Lord of the Gate, a brave and generous man.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_u. Historical narrative resumed._)\r\n\r\nAfter Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā's death, his begs in agreement, sent a courier by\r\nthe mountain-road to invite Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā.[227]\r\n\r\nMalik-i-Muḥammad Mīrzā, the son of Minūchihr Mīrzā, Sl. Abū-sa`īd\r\nMīrzā's eldest brother, aspired for his own part to rule. Having drawn a\r\nfew adventurers and desperadoes to himself, they dribbled away[228] from\r\n(Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā's) camp and went to Samarkand. He was not able to\r\neffect anything, but he brought about his own death and that of several\r\ninnocent persons of the ruling House.\r\n\r\nAt once on hearing of his brother's death, Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā went off to\r\nSamarkand and there seated himself on the throne, without difficulty.\r\nSome of his doings soon disgusted and alienated high and low, soldier\r\nand peasant. The first of these was that he sent the above-named\r\nMalik-i-Muḥammad to the [Sidenote: Fol. 23b.] Kūk-sarāī,[229] although\r\nhe was his father's brother's son and his own son-in-law.[230] With him\r\nhe sent others, four Mīrzās in all. Two of these he set aside;\r\nMalik-i-Muḥammad and one other he martyred. Some of the four were not\r\neven of ruling rank and had not the smallest aspiration to rule; though\r\nMalik-i-Muḥammad Mīrzā was a little in fault, in the rest there was no\r\nblame whatever. A second thing was that though his methods and\r\nregulations were excellent, and though he was expert in revenue matters\r\nand in the art of administration, his nature inclined to tyranny and\r\nvice. Directly he reached Samarkand, he began to make new regulations\r\nand arrangements and to rate and tax on a new basis. Moreover the\r\ndependants of his (late) Highness Khwāja `Ubaid'l-lāh, under whose\r\nprotection formerly many poor and destitute persons had lived free from\r\nthe burden of dues and imposts, were now themselves treated with\r\nharshness and oppression. On what ground should hardship have touched\r\nthem? Nevertheless oppressive exactions were made from them, indeed from\r\nthe Khwāja's very children. Yet another thing was that just as he was\r\nvicious and tyrannical, so were his begs, small and great, and his\r\nretainers and followers. The Ḥiṣārīs and in particular the followers of\r\nKhusrau Shāh engaged themselves unceasingly with wine and fornication.\r\nOnce one of them enticed and took away a certain man's wife. [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 24.]When her husband went to Khusrau Shāh and asked for justice, he\r\nreceived for answer: \"She has been with you for several years; let her\r\nbe a few days with him.\" Another thing was that the young sons of the\r\ntownsmen and shopkeepers, nay! even of Turks and soldiers could not go\r\nout from their houses from fear of being taken for catamites. The\r\nSamarakandīs, having passed 20 or 25 years under Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā in ease\r\nand tranquillity, most matters carried through lawfully and with justice\r\nby his Highness the Khwāja, were wounded and troubled in heart and soul,\r\nby this oppression and this vice. Low and high, the poor, the destitute,\r\nall opened the mouth to curse, all lifted the hand for redress.\r\n\r\n   \"Beware the steaming up of inward wounds,\r\n    For an inward wound at the last makes head;\r\n    Avoid while thou canst, distress to one heart,\r\n    For a single sigh will convulse a world.\"[231]\r\n\r\nBy reason of his infamous violence and vice Sl. Maḥmud Mīrzā did not\r\nrule in Samarkand more than five or six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n900 AH.-OCT. 2ND. 1494 TO SEP. 21ST. 1495 AD.[232]\r\n\r\nThis year Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā sent an envoy, named `Abdu'l-qadūs Beg,[233]\r\nto bring me a gift from the wedding he had made with splendid festivity\r\nfor his eldest son, Mas`ūd Mīrzā with (Ṣāliḥa-sulṯān), the Fair Begīm,\r\nthe second daughter of his elder brother, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā. They had sent\r\ngold and silver almonds and pistachios.\r\n\r\nThere must have been relationship between this envoy and Ḥasan-i-yaq`ūb,\r\nand on its account he will have been the man sent to make\r\nḤasan-i-yaq`ūb, by fair promises, look towards Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā.\r\nḤasan-i-yaq`ūb returned him a smooth answer, made indeed as though won\r\nover to his side, and gave him leave to go. Five or six months later,\r\nhis manners changed entirely; he began to behave ill to those about me\r\nand to others, and he carried matters so far that he would have\r\ndismissed me in order to put Jahāngīr Mīrzā in my place. Moreover his\r\nconversation with the whole body of begs and soldiers was not what\r\nshould be; every-one came to know what was in his mind. Khwāja-i-Qāzī\r\nand (Sayyid) Qāsim _Qūchīn_ and `Alī-dost T̤aghāī met other well-wishers\r\nof mine in the presence of my grandmother, Āīsān-daulat Begīm and\r\ndecided to give quietus to Ḥasan-i-yaq`ūb's disloyalty by his\r\ndeposition.\r\n\r\nFew amongst women will have been my grandmother's equals for judgment\r\nand counsel; she was very wise and far-sighted and most affairs of mine\r\nwere carried through under her advice. She and my mother were (living)\r\nin the Gate-house of the outer fort;[234] Ḥasan-i-yaq`ūb was in the\r\ncitadel.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to the citadel, in pursuance of our decision, he had ridden\r\nout, presumably for hawking, and as soon as he had [Sidenote: Fol. 25.]\r\nour news, went off from where he was towards Samarkand. The begs and\r\nothers in sympathy with him,[235] were arrested; one was Muḥammad Bāqir\r\nBeg; Sl. Maḥmud _Dūldāī_, Sl. Muḥammad _Dūldāī's_ father, was another;\r\nthere were several more; to some leave was given to go for Samarkand.\r\nThe Andijān Government and control of my Gate were settled on (Sayyid)\r\nQāsim _Qūchīn_.\r\n\r\nA few days after Ḥasan-i-yaq`ūb reached Kand-i-badām on the Samarkand\r\nroad, he went to near the Khūqān sub-division (_aūrchīn_) with\r\nill-intent on Akhsī. Hearing of it, we sent several begs and braves to\r\noppose him; they, as they went, detached a scouting party ahead; he,\r\nhearing this, moved against the detachment, surrounded it in its\r\nnight-quarters[236] and poured flights of arrows (_shība_) in on it. In\r\nthe darkness of the night an arrow (_aūq_), shot by one of his own men,\r\nhit him just (_aūq_) in the vent (_qāchār_) and before he could take\r\nvent (_qāchār_),[237] he became the captive of his own act.\r\n\r\n   \"If you have done ill, keep not an easy mind,\r\n    For retribution is Nature's law.\"[238]\r\n\r\nThis year I began to abstain from all doubtful food, my obedience\r\nextended even to the knife, the spoon and the table-cloth;[239] also the\r\nafter-midnight Prayer (_taḥajjud_) was [Sidenote: Fol. 25b.] less\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Death of Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā._)\r\n\r\nIn the month of the latter Rabī` (January 1495 AD.), Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā\r\nwas confronted by violent illness and in six days, passed from the\r\nworld. He was 43 (lunar) years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. His birth and lineage._\r\n\r\nHe was born in 857 AH. (1453 AD.), was Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā's third son\r\nand the full-brother of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā.[240]\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. His appearance and characteristics._\r\n\r\nHe was a short, stout, sparse-bearded and somewhat ill-shaped person.\r\nHis manners and his qualities were good, his rules and methods of\r\nbusiness excellent; he was well-versed in accounts, not a _dinār_ or a\r\n_dirhām_[241] of revenue was spent without his knowledge. The pay of his\r\nservants was never disallowed. His assemblies, his gifts, his open\r\ntable, were all good. Everything of his was orderly and\r\nwell-arranged;[242] no soldier or peasant could deviate in the slightest\r\nfrom any plan of his. Formerly he must have been hard set (_qātīrār_) on\r\nhawking but latterly he very frequently hunted driven game.[243] He\r\ncarried violence and vice to frantic excess, was a constant wine-bibber\r\nand kept many catamites. If anywhere in his territory, there was a\r\nhandsome boy, he used, by whatever means, to have him brought for a\r\ncatamite; of his begs' sons and of his sons' begs' sons he made\r\ncatamites; and laid command for this service on [Sidenote: Fol. 26.] his\r\nvery foster brothers and on their own brothers. So common in his day was\r\nthat vile practice, that no person was without his catamite; to keep one\r\nwas thought a merit, not to keep one, a defect. Through his infamous\r\nviolence and vice, his sons died in the day of their strength (_tamām\r\njuwān_).\r\n\r\nHe had a taste for poetry and put a _dīwān_[244] together but his verse\r\nis flat and insipid,—not to compose is better than to compose verse such\r\nas his. He was not firm in the Faith and held his Highness Khwāja\r\n`Ubaidu'l-lāh (_Aḥrārī_) in slight esteem. He had no heart (_yūruk_) and\r\nwas somewhat scant in modesty,—several of his impudent buffoons used to\r\ndo their filthy and abominable acts in his full Court, in all men's\r\nsight. He spoke badly, there was no understanding him at first.\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. His battles._\r\n\r\nHe fought two battles, both with Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā (_Bāīqarā_). The first\r\nwas in Astarābād; here he was defeated. The second was at Chīkman\r\n(Sarāī),[245] near Andikhūd; here also he was defeated. He went twice to\r\nKāfiristān, on the [Sidenote: Fol. 26b.] south of Badakhshān, and made\r\nHoly War; for this reason they wrote him Sl. Maḥmūd _Ghāzī_ in the\r\nheadings of his public papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. His countries._\r\n\r\nSl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā gave him Astarābād.[246] After the `Irāq disaster\r\n(_i.e._, his father's death,) he went into Khurāsān. At that time,\r\nQaṃbar-`alī Beg, the governor of Ḥiṣār, by Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā's orders,\r\nhad mobilized the Hindūstān[247] army and was following him into `Irāq;\r\nhe joined Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā in Khurāsān but the Khurāsānīs, hearing of\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's approach, rose suddenly and drove them out of the\r\ncountry. On this Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā went to his elder brother, Sl. Aḥmad\r\nMīrzā in Samarkand. A few months later Sayyid Badr and Khusrau Shāh and\r\nsome braves under Aḥmad _Mushtāq_[248] took him and fled to Qaṃbar-`alī\r\nin Ḥiṣār. From that time forth, Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā possessed the countries\r\nlying south of Quhqa (Quhlugha) and the Kohtin Range as far as the\r\nHindū-kush Mountains, such as Tīrmīẕ, Chaghānīān, Ḥiṣār, Khutlān, Qūndūz\r\nand Badakhshān. He also held Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā's lands, after his\r\nbrother's death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_f. His children._\r\n\r\nHe had five sons and eleven daughters.\r\n\r\nSl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā was his eldest son; his mother was Khān-zāda [Sidenote:\r\nFol 27.] Begīm, a daughter of the Great Mīr of Tīrmīẕ. Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā\r\nwas another; his mother was Pasha (or Pāshā) Begīm. Sl. `Alī Mīrzā was\r\nanother; his mother was an Aūzbeg, a concubine called Zuhra Begī Āghā.\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā was another; his mother was Khān-zāda Begīm, a\r\ngrand-daughter of the Great Mīr of Tīrmīẕ; he went to God's mercy in his\r\nfather's life-time, at the age of 13. Sl. Wais Mīrzā (Mīrzā Khān) was\r\nanother; his mother, Sulṯān-nigār Khānīm was a daughter of Yūnas Khān\r\nand was a younger (half-) sister of my mother. The affairs of these four\r\nMīrzās will be written of in this history under the years of their\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nOf Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā's daughters, three were by the same mother as\r\nBāī-sunghar Mīrzā. One of these, Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā's senior, Sl. Maḥmūd\r\nMīrzā made to go out to Malik-i-muḥammad Mīrzā, the son of his paternal\r\nuncle, Minūchihr Mīrzā.[249]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive other daughters were by Khān-zāda Begīm, the grand-daughter of the\r\nGreat Mīr of Tīrmīẕ. The oldest of these, (Khān-zāda Begīm)[250] was\r\ngiven, after her father's death, to Abā-bikr [Sidenote: Fol. 27b.]\r\n(_Dūghlāt_) _Kāshgharī_. The second was Bega Begīm. When Sl. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā besieged Ḥiṣār (901 AH.), he took her for Ḥaidar Mīrzā, his son by\r\nPāyanda Begīm, Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā's daughter, and having done so, rose\r\nfrom before the place.[251] The third daughter was Āq (Fair) Begīm; the\r\nfourth[252]—,was betrothed to Jahāngīr Mīrzā (_aet._ 5, _circa_ 895 AH.)\r\nat the time his father, `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā sent him to help Sl. Maḥmūd\r\nMīrzā with the Andijān army, against Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, then attacking\r\nQūndūz.[253] In 910 AH. (1504 AD.) when Bāqī _Chaghānīānī_[254] waited\r\non me on the bank of the Amū (Oxus), these (last-named two) Begīms were\r\nwith their mothers in Tīrmīẕ and joined me then with Bāqī's family. When\r\nwe reached Kahmard, Jahāngīr Mīrzā took —-- Begīm; one little daughter\r\nwas born; she now[255] is in the Badakhshān country with her\r\ngrandmother. The fifth daughter was Zainab-sulṯān Begīm; under my\r\nmother's insistence, I took her at the time of the capture of Kābul (910\r\nAH.-Oct. 1504 AD.). She did not become very congenial; two or three\r\nyears later, she left the world, through small-pox. Another daughter was\r\nMakhdūm-sulṯān Begīm, Sl. `Alī Mīrzā's full-sister; she is now in the\r\nBadakhshān country. Two others of his daughters, Rajab-sulṯān and\r\nMuḥibb-sulṯān, were by mistresses (_ghūnchachī_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_g. His ladies_ (_khwātīnlār_) _and concubines_ (_sarārī_).\r\n\r\nHis chief wife, Khān-zāda Begīm, was a daughter of the [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n28.] Great Mīr of Tirmīẕ; he had great affection for her and must have\r\nmourned her bitterly; she was the mother of Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā. Later on,\r\nhe took her brother's daughter, also called Khān-zāda Begīm, a\r\ngrand-daughter of the Great Mīr of Tīrmīẕ. She became the mother of\r\nfive of his daughters and one of his sons. Pasha (or Pāshā) Begīm was\r\nanother wife, a daughter of `Alī-shukr Beg, a Turkmān Beg of the Black\r\nSheep Bahārlū Aīmāq.[256] She had been the wife of Jahān-shāh (_Barānī_)\r\nof the Black Sheep Turkmāns. After Aūzūn (Long) Ḥasan Beg of the White\r\nSheep had taken Āẕar-bāījān and `Irāq from the sons of this Jahān-shāh\r\nMīrzā (872 AH.-1467 AD.), `Alī-shukr Beg's sons went with four or five\r\nthousand heads-of-houses of the Black Sheep Turkmāns to serve Sl.\r\nAbū-sa`īd Mīrzā and after the Mīrzā's defeat (873 AH. by Aūzūn Ḥasan),\r\ncame down to these countries and took service with Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā.\r\nThis happened after Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā came to Ḥiṣār from Samarkand, and\r\nthen it was he took Pasha Begīm. She became the mother of one of his\r\nsons and three of his daughters. Sulṯān-nigār Khānīm was another of his\r\nladies; her descent has been mentioned already in the account of the\r\n(Chaghatāī) Khāns. [Sidenote: Fol. 28b.]\r\n\r\nHe had many concubines and mistresses. His most honoured concubine\r\n(_mu`atabar ghūma_) was Zuhra Begī Āghā; she was taken in his father's\r\nlife-time and became the mother of one son and one daughter. He had many\r\nmistresses and, as has been said, two of his daughters were by two of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_h. His amirs._\r\n\r\nKhusrau Shāh was of the Turkistānī Qīpchāqs. He had been in the intimate\r\nservice of the Tarkhān begs, indeed had been a catamite. Later on he\r\nbecame a retainer of Mazīd Beg (Tarkhān) _Arghūn_ who favoured him in\r\nall things. He was favoured by Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā on account of services\r\ndone by him when, after the `Irāq disaster, he joined the Mīrzā on his\r\nway to Khurāsān. He waxed very great in his latter days; his retainers,\r\nunder Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā, were a clear five or six thousand. Not only\r\nBadakhshān but the whole country from the Amū to the Hindū-kush\r\nMountains depended on him and he devoured its whole revenue (_darobast\r\nyīr īdī_). His open table was good, so too his open hand; though he was\r\na rough getter,[257] what he got, he spent liberally. He waxed\r\nexceeding great after Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā's death, in whose sons' time his\r\nretainers approached 20,000. Although he prayed and abstained from\r\nforbidden aliments, yet was he black-souled and vicious, [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n29.] dunder-headed and senseless, disloyal and a traitor to his salt.\r\nFor the sake of this fleeting, five-days world,[258] he blinded one of\r\nhis benefactor's sons and murdered another. A sinner before God,\r\nreprobate to His creatures, he has earned curse and execration till the\r\nvery verge of Resurrection. For this world's sake he did his evil deeds\r\nand yet, with lands so broad and with such hosts of armed retainers, he\r\nhad not pluck to stand up to a hen. An account of him will come into\r\nthis history.\r\n\r\nPīr-i-muḥammad _Aīlchī-būghā[259] Qūchīn_ was another. In Hazārāspī's\r\nfight[260] he got in one challenge with his fists in Sl. Abū-sa`īd\r\nMīrzā's presence at the Gate of Balkh. He was a brave man, continuously\r\nserving the Mīrzā (Maḥmūd) and guiding him by his counsel. Out of\r\nrivalry to Khusrau Shāh, he made a night-attack when the Mīrzā was\r\nbesieging Qūndūz, on Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, with few men, without arming[261]\r\nand without plan; he could do nothing; what was there he could do\r\nagainst such and so large a force? He was pursued, threw himself into\r\nthe river and was drowned.\r\n\r\nAyūb (_Begchīk Mughūl_)[262] was another. He had served in Sl. Abū-sa`īd\r\nMīrzā's Khurāsān Cadet Corps, a brave man, Bāīsunghar Mīrzā's guardian.\r\nHe was choice in dress and food; a jester and talkative, nicknamed\r\nImpudence, perhaps because the Mīrzā called him so. [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n29b.]\r\n\r\nWalī was another, the younger, full-brother of Khusrau Shāh. He kept his\r\nretainers well. He it was brought about the blinding of Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā\r\nand the murder of Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā. He had an ill-word for every-one\r\nand was an evil-tongued, foul-mouthed, self-pleasing and dull-witted\r\nmannikin. He approved of no-one but himself. When I went from the Qūndūz\r\ncountry to near Dūshī (910 AH.-1503 AD.), separated Khusrau Shāh from\r\nhis following and dismissed him, this person (_i.e._, Walī) had come to\r\nAndar-āb and Sīr-āb, also in fear of the Aūzbegs. The Aīmāqs of those\r\nparts beat and robbed him[263] then, having let me know, came on to\r\nKābul. Walī went to Shaibānī Khān who had his head struck off in the\r\ntown of Samarkand.\r\n\r\nShaikh `Abdu'l-lāh _Barlās_[264] was another; he had to wife one of the\r\ndaughters of Shāh Sulṯān Muḥammad (_Badakhshī_) _i.e._, the maternal\r\naunt of Abā-bikr Mīrzā (_Mīrān-shāhī_) and of Sl. Maḥmūd Khān. He wore\r\nhis tunic narrow and _pur shaqq_[265]; he was a kindly well-bred man.\r\n\r\nMaḥmūd _Barlās_ of the Barlāses of Nūndāk (Badakhshān) was another. He\r\nhad been a beg also of Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā and had surrendered Karmān to\r\nhim when the Mīrzā took the `Irāq countries. When Abā-bikr Mīrzā\r\n(_Mīrān-shāhī_) came [Sidenote: Fol. 30.] against Ḥiṣār with Mazīd Beg\r\nTarkhān and the Black Sheep Turkmāns, and Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā went off to\r\nhis elder brother, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā in Samarkand, Maḥmūd _Barlās_ did not\r\nsurrender Ḥiṣār but held out manfully.[266] He was a poet and put a\r\n_dīwān_ together.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Historical narrative resumed_).\r\n\r\nWhen Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā died, Khusrau Shāh kept the event concealed and\r\nlaid a long hand on the treasure. But how could such news be hidden? It\r\nspread through the town at once. That was a festive day for the\r\nSamarkand families; soldier and peasant, they uprose in tumult against\r\nKhusrau Shāh. Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg and the Tarkhānī begs put the rising down\r\nand turned Khusrau Shāh out of the town with an escort for Ḥiṣār.\r\n\r\nAs Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā himself after giving Ḥiṣār to Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā and\r\nBukhārā to Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā, had dismissed both to their governments,\r\nneither was present when he died. The Ḥiṣār and Samarkand begs, after\r\nturning Khusrau Shāh out, agreed to send for Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā from\r\nBukhārā, brought him to Samarkand and seated him on the throne. When he\r\nthus became supreme (_pādshāh_), he was 18 (lunar) years old.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis, Sl. Maḥmūd Khān (_Chaghatāī_), acting on the [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 30b.] word of Junaid _Barlās_ and of some of the notables of\r\nSamarkand, led his army out to near Kān-bāī with desire to take that\r\ntown. Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā, on his side, marched out in force. They fought\r\nnear Kān-bāī. Ḥaidar _Kūkūldāsh_, the main pillar of the Mughūl army,\r\nled the Mughūl van. He and all his men dismounted and were pouring in\r\nflights of arrows (_shība_) when a large body of the mailed braves of\r\nḤiṣār and Samarkand made an impetuous charge and straightway laid them\r\nunder their horses' feet. Their leader taken, the Mughūl army was put to\r\nrout without more fighting. Masses (_qālīn_) of Mughūls were wiped out;\r\nso many were beheaded in Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā's presence that his tent was\r\nthree times shifted because of the number of the dead.\r\n\r\nAt this same crisis, Ibrāhīm _Sārū_ entered the fort of Asfara, there\r\nread Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā's name in the _Khuṯba_ and took up a position of\r\nhostility to me.\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note._) Ibrāhīm _Sārū_ is of the Mīnglīgh\r\n   people;[267] he had served my father in various ways from his\r\n   childhood but later on had been dismissed for some fault.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 31.] The army rode out to crush this rebellion in the\r\nmonth of Sha'bān (May) and by the end of it, had dismounted round\r\nAsfara. Our braves in the wantonness of enterprise, on the very day of\r\narrival, took the new wall[268] that was in building outside the fort.\r\nThat day Sayyid Qāsim, Lord of my Gate, out-stripped the rest and got in\r\nwith his sword; Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_ and Muḥammad-dost T̤aghāī got theirs\r\nin also but Sayyid Qāsim won the Champion's Portion. He took it in\r\nShāhrukhiya when I went to see my mother's brother, Sl. Maḥmūd Khān.\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note._) The Championship Portion[269] is an ancient\r\n   usage of the Mughūl horde. Whoever outdistanced his tribe and\r\n   got in with his own sword, took the portion at every feast and\r\n   entertainment.\r\n\r\nMy guardian, Khudāī-bīrdī Beg died in that first day's fighting, struck\r\nby a cross-bow arrow. As the assault was made without armour, several\r\nbare braves (_yīkīt yīlāng_)[270] perished and many were wounded. One of\r\nIbrāhīm _Sārū's_ cross-bowmen was an excellent shot; his equal had never\r\nbeen seen; he it was hit most of those wounded. When Asfara had been\r\ntaken, he entered my service.\r\n\r\nAs the siege drew on, orders were given to construct head-strikes[271]\r\nin two or three places, to run mines and to make every [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n31b.] effort to prepare appliances for taking the fort. The siege lasted\r\n40 days; at last Ibrāhīm _Sārū_ had no resource but, through the\r\nmediation of Khwāja Moulānā-i-qāẓī, to elect to serve me. In the month\r\nof Shawwāl (June 1495 A.D.) he came out, with his sword and quiver\r\nhanging from his neck, waited on me and surrendered the fort.\r\n\r\nKhujand for a considerable time had been dependent on `Umar Shaikh\r\nMīrzā's Court (_dīwān_) but of late had looked towards Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā\r\non account of the disturbance in the Farghāna government during the\r\ninterregnum.[272] As the opportunity offered, a move against it also\r\nwas now made. Mīr Mughūl's father, `Abdu'l-wahhāb _Shaghāwal_[273] was\r\nin it; he surrendered without making any difficulty at once on our\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nJust then Sl. Maḥmūd Khān was in Shāhrukhiya. It has been said already\r\nthat when Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā came into Andijān (899 AH.), he also came and\r\nthat he laid siege to Akhsī. It occurred to me that if since I was so\r\nclose, I went and waited on him, he being, as it were, my father and my\r\nelder brother, and if bye-gone resentments were laid aside, it would be\r\ngood hearing and seeing for far and near. So said, I went.\r\n\r\nI waited on The Khān in the garden Ḥaidar _Kūkūldāsh_ had made outside\r\nShāhrukhiya. He was seated in a large four-doored [Sidenote: Fol. 32.]\r\ntent set up in the middle of it. Having entered the tent, I knelt three\r\ntimes,[274] he for his part, rising to do me honour. We looked one\r\nanother in the eyes;[275] and he returned to his seat. After I had\r\nkneeled, he called me to his side and shewed me much affection and\r\nfriendliness. Two or three days later, I set off for Akhsī and Andijān\r\nby the Kīndīrlīk Pass.[276] At Akhsī I made the circuit of my Father's\r\ntomb. I left at the hour of the Friday Prayer (_i.e._, about midday)\r\nand reached Andijān, by the Band-i-sālār Road between the Evening and\r\nBedtime Prayers. This road _i.e._ the Band-i-sālār, people call a nine\r\n_yīghāch_ road.[277]\r\n\r\nOne of the tribes of the wilds of Andijān is the Jīgrāk[278] a numerous\r\npeople of five or six thousand households, dwelling in the mountains\r\nbetween Kāshghar and Farghāna. They have many horses and sheep and also\r\nnumbers of yāks (_qūtās_), these hill-people keeping yāks instead of\r\ncommon cattle. As their mountains are border-fastnesses, they have a\r\nfashion of not paying tribute. An army was now sent against them under\r\n(Sayyid) Qāsim Beg in order that out of the tribute taken from them\r\nsomething might reach the soldiers. He took about 20,000 of their sheep\r\nand between 1000 and 1500 of their horses and shared all out to the men.\r\n\r\nAfter its return from the Jīgrāk, the army set out for Aūrā-tīpā.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 34.] Formerly this was held by `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā but it\r\nhad gone out of hand in the year of his death and Sl. `Alī Mīrzā was now\r\nin it on behalf of his elder brother, Bāīsunghar Mīrzā. When Sl. `Alī\r\nMīrzā heard of our coming, he went off himself to the Macha\r\nhill-country, leaving his guardian, Shaikh Ẕū'n-nūn _Arghūn_ behind.\r\nFrom half-way between Khujand and Aūrā-tīpā, Khalīfa[279] was sent as\r\nenvoy to Shaikh Ẕū'n-nūn but that senseless mannikin, instead of giving\r\nhim a plain answer, laid hands on him and ordered him to death. For\r\nKhalīfa to die cannot have been the Divine will; he escaped and came to\r\nme two or three days later, stripped bare and having suffered a hundred\r\n_tūmāns_ (1,000,000) of hardships and fatigues. We went almost to\r\nAūrā-tīpā but as, winter being near, people had carried away their corn\r\nand forage, after a few days we turned back for Andijān. After our\r\nretirement, The Khān's men moved on the place when the Aūrā-tīpā\r\nperson[280] unable to make a stand, surrendered and came out. The Khān\r\nthen gave it to Muḥammad Ḥusain _Kūrkān Dūghlāt_ and in his hands it\r\nremained till 908 AH. (1503).[281]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n901 AH.—SEP. 21ST. 1495 TO SEP. 9TH. 1496 AD.[282]\r\n\r\n(_a. Sulṯān Ḥusain Mīrzā's campaign against Khusrau Shāh_).\r\n\r\nIn the winter of this year, Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā led his army out of\r\nKhurāsān against Ḥiṣār and went to opposite Tīrmīẕ. Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā,\r\nfor his part, brought an army (from Ḥiṣār) and sat down over against him\r\nin Tīrmīẕ. Khusrau Shāh strengthened himself in Qūndūz and to help Sl.\r\nMas`ūd Mīrzā sent his younger brother, Walī. They (_i.e._, the opposed\r\nforces) spent most of that winter on the river's banks, no crossing\r\nbeing effected. Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā was a shrewd and experienced commander;\r\nhe marched up the river,[283] his face set for Qūndūz and by this having\r\nput Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā off his guard, sent `Abdu'l-laṯīf _Bakhshī_\r\n(pay-master) with 5 or 600 serviceable men, down the river to the Kilīf\r\nferry. These crossed and had entrenched themselves on the other bank\r\nbefore Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā had heard of their movement. When he did hear of\r\nit, whether because of pressure put upon him by Bāqī _Chaghānīānī_ to\r\nspite (his half-brother) Walī, or whether from his own want of heart, he\r\ndid not march against those who had crossed but disregarding Walī's\r\nurgency, at once broke up his camp and turned for Ḥiṣār.[284]\r\n\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā crossed the river and then sent, (1) against Khusrau\r\nShāh, Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā and Ibrāhīm Ḥusain Mīrzā with Muḥammad Walī\r\nBeg and Ẕū'n-nūn _Arghūn_, and [Sidenote: Fol. 33b.] (2) against\r\nKhutlān, Muz̤affar Ḥusain Mīrzā with Muḥammad _Barandūq Barlās_. He\r\nhimself moved for Ḥiṣār.\r\n\r\nWhen those in Ḥiṣār heard of his approach, they took their precautions;\r\nSl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā did not judge it well to stay in the fort but went off\r\nup the Kām Rūd valley[285] and by way of Sara-tāq to his younger\r\nbrother, Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā in Samarkand. Walī, for his part drew off to\r\n(his own district) Khutlān. Bāqī _Chaghānīānī_, Maḥmūd _Barlās_ and Qūch\r\nBeg's father, Sl. Aḥmad strengthened the fort of Ḥiṣār. Ḥamza Sl. and\r\nMahdī Sl. (_Aūzbeg_) who some years earlier had left Shaibānī Khān for\r\n(the late) Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā's service, now, in this dispersion, drew off\r\nwith all their Aūzbegs, for Qarā-tīgīn. With them went Muḥammad\r\n_Dūghlāt_[286] and Sl. Ḥusain _Dūghlāt_ and all the Mughūls located in\r\nthe Ḥiṣār country.\r\n\r\nUpon this Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā sent Abū'l-muḥsin Mīrzā after Sl. Mas`ūd\r\nMīrzā up the Kām Rūd valley. They were not strong enough for such work\r\nwhen they reached the defile.[287] There Mīrzā Beg _Fīringī-bāz_[288]\r\ngot in his sword. In pursuit of Ḥamza Sl. into Qarā-tīgīn, Sl. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā sent Ibrāhīm Tarkhān and Yaq`ūb-i-ayūb. They overtook the sulṯāns\r\nand [Sidenote: Fol. 33.] fought. The Mīrzā's detachment was defeated;\r\nmost of his begs were unhorsed but all were allowed to go free.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Bābur's reception of the Aūzbeg sulṯāns._)\r\n\r\nAs a result of this exodus, Ḥamza Sl. with his son, Mamāq Sl., and Mahdī\r\nSl. and Muḥammad _Dūghlāt_, later known as _Ḥiṣārī_ and his brother, Sl.\r\nḤusain _Dūghlāt_ with the Aūzbegs dependent on the sulṯāns and the\r\nMughūls who had been located in Ḥiṣār as (the late) Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā's\r\nretainers, came, after letting me know (their intention), and waited\r\nupon me in Ramẓān (May-June) at Andijān. According to the custom of\r\nTīmūriya sulṯāns on such occasions, I had seated myself on a raised seat\r\n(_tūshāk_); when Ḥamza Sl. and Mamāq Sl. and Mahdī Sl. entered, I rose\r\nand went down to do them honour; we looked one another in the eyes and I\r\nplaced them on my right, _bāghīsh dā_.[289] A number of Mughūls also\r\ncame, under Muḥammad _Ḥiṣārī_; all elected for my service.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's affairs resumed_).\r\n\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, on reaching Ḥiṣār, settled down at once to besiege it.\r\nThere was no rest, day nor night, from the labours of mining and attack,\r\nof working catapults and mortars. Mines were run in four or five places.\r\nWhen one had gone well forward towards the Gate, the townsmen,\r\ncountermining, struck it and forced smoke down on the Mīrzā's men; they,\r\nin turn, [Sidenote: Fol. 34b.] closed the hole, thus sent the smoke\r\nstraight back and made the townsmen flee as from the very maw of death.\r\nIn the end, the townsmen drove the besiegers out by pouring jar after\r\njar of water in on them. Another day, a party dashed out from the town\r\nand drove off the Mīrzā's men from their own mine's mouth. Once the\r\ndischarges from catapults and mortars in the Mīrzā's quarters on the\r\nnorth cracked a tower of the fort; it fell at the Bed-time Prayer; some\r\nof the Mīrzā's braves begged to assault at once but he refused, saying,\r\n\"It is night.\" Before the shoot of the next day's dawn, the besieged had\r\nrebuilt the whole tower. That day too there was no assault; in fact, for\r\nthe two to two and a half months of the siege, no attack was made except\r\nby keeping up the blockade,[290] by mining, rearing head-strikes,[291]\r\nand discharging stones.\r\n\r\nWhen Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā and whatever (_nī kīm_) troops had been sent\r\nwith him against Khusrau Shāh, dismounted some 16 m. (3 to 4 _yīghāch_)\r\nbelow Qūndūz,[292] Khusrau Shāh arrayed whatever men (_nī kīm_) he had,\r\nmarched out, halted one night on the way, formed up to fight and came\r\ndown upon the Mīrzā and his men. The Khurāsānīs may not have been twice\r\nas many as his men but what question is there they were half [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 35.] as many more? None the less did such Mīrzās and such\r\nCommander-begs elect for prudence and remain in their entrenchments!\r\nGood and bad, small and great, Khusrau Shāh's force may have been of 4\r\nor 5,000 men!\r\n\r\nThis was the one exploit of his life,—of this man who for the sake of\r\nthis fleeting and unstable world and for the sake of shifting and\r\nfaithless followers, chose such evil and such ill-repute, practised such\r\ntyranny and injustice, seized such wide lands, kept such hosts of\r\nretainers and followers,—latterly he led out between 20 and 30,000 and\r\nhis countries and his districts (_parganāt_) exceeded those of his own\r\nruler and that ruler's sons,[293]—for an exploit such as this his name\r\nand the names of his adherents were noised abroad for generalship and\r\nfor this they were counted brave, while those timorous laggards, in the\r\ntrenches, won the resounding fame of cowards.\r\n\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā marched out from that camp and after a few stages\r\nreached the Alghū Mountain of Tāliqān[294] and there made halt. Khusrau\r\nShāh, in Qūndūz, sent his brother, Walī, with serviceable men, to\r\nIshkīmīsh, Fulūl and the hill-skirts thereabouts to annoy and harass the\r\nMīrzā from outside also. Muḥibb-`alī, the armourer, (_qūrchī_) for his\r\npart, came down [Sidenote: Fol. 35b.] (from Walī's Khutlān) to the bank\r\nof the Khutlān Water, met in with some of the Mīrzā's men there,\r\nunhorsed some, cut off a few heads and got away. In emulation of this,\r\nSayyidīm `Alī[295] the door-keeper, and his younger brother, Qulī Beg\r\nand Bihlūl-i-ayūb and a body of their men got to grips with the\r\nKhurāsānīs on the skirt of `Aṃbar Koh, near Khwāja Changāl but, many\r\nKhurāsānīs coming up, Sayyidīm `Alī and Bābā Beg's (son) Qulī Beg and\r\nothers were unhorsed.\r\n\r\nAt the time these various news reached Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, his army was\r\nnot without distress through the spring rains of Ḥiṣār; he therefore\r\nbrought about a peace; Maḥmūd _Barlās_ came out from those in the fort;\r\nḤājī Pīr the Taster went from those outside; the great commanders and\r\nwhat there was (_nī kīm_) of musicians and singers assembled and the\r\nMīrzā took (Bega Begīm), the eldest[296] daughter of Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā by\r\nKhān-zāda Begīm, for Ḥaidar Mīrzā, his son by Pāyanda Begīm and through\r\nher the grandson of Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā. This done, he rose from before\r\nḤiṣār and set his face for Qūndūz.\r\n\r\nAt Qūndūz also Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā made a few trenches and took up the\r\nbesieger's position but by Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's intervention peace at\r\nlength was made, prisoners were exchanged and the Khurāsānīs retired.\r\nThe twice-repeated[297] attacks made by Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā on Khusrau Shāh\r\nand his unsuccessful retirements were the cause of Khusrau Shāh's\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 36.] great rise and of action of his so much beyond his\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mīrzā reached Balkh, he, in the interests of [M.]ā\r\nwarā'u'n-nahr gave it to Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā, gave Badī`u'z-zamān\r\nMīrzā's district of Astarābād to (a younger son), Muz̤affar Ḥusain Mīrzā\r\nand made both kneel at the same assembly, one for Balkh, the other for\r\nAstarābād. This offended Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā and led to years of\r\nrebellion and disturbance.[298]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Revolt of the Tarkhānīs in Samarkand_).\r\n\r\nIn Ramẓān of this same year, the Tarkhānīs revolted in Samarkand. Here\r\nis the story:—Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā was not so friendly and familiar with\r\nthe begs and soldiers of Samarkand as he was with those of Ḥiṣār.[299]\r\nHis favourite beg was Shaikh `Abdu'l-lāh _Barlās_[300] whose sons were\r\nso intimate with the Mīrzā that it made a relation as of Lover and\r\nBeloved. These things displeased the Tarkhāns and the Samarkandī begs;\r\nDarwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān went from Bukhārā to Qarshī, brought Sl. `Alī\r\nMīrzā to Samarkand and raised him to be supreme. People then went to the\r\nNew Garden where Bāī-sunghar [Sidenote: Fol. 36b.] Mīrzā was, treated\r\nhim like a prisoner, parted him from his following and took him to the\r\ncitadel. There they seated both mīrzās in one place, thinking to send\r\nBāī-sunghar Mīrzā to the Gūk Sarāī close to the Other Prayer. The Mīrzā,\r\nhowever, on plea of necessity, went into one of the palace-buildings on\r\nthe east side of the Bū-stān Sarāī. Tarkhānīs stood outside the door and\r\nwith him went in Muḥammad Qulī _Qūchīn_ and Ḥasan, the sherbet-server.\r\nTo be brief:—A gateway, leading out to the back, must have been bricked\r\nup for they broke down the obstacle at once. The Mīrzā got out of the\r\ncitadel on the Kafshīr side, through the water-conduit (_āb-mūrī_),\r\ndropped himself from the rampart of the water-way (_dū-tahī_), and went\r\nto Khwājakī Khwāja's[301] house in Khwāja Kafshīr. When the Tarkhānīs,\r\nin waiting at the door, took the precaution of looking in, they found\r\nhim gone. Next day the Tarkhānīs went in a large body to Khwājakī\r\nKhwāja's gate but the Khwāja said, \"No!\"[302] and did not give him up.\r\nEven they could not take him by force, the Khwāja's dignity was too\r\ngreat for them to be able to use force. A few days later, Khwāja\r\nAbu'l-makāram[303] and Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg and other begs, great and\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 37.] small, and soldiers and townsmen rose in a mass,\r\nfetched the Mīrzā away from the Khwāja's house and besieged Sl. `Ali\r\nMīrzā and the Tarkhāns in the citadel. They could not hold out for even\r\na day; Muḥ. Mazīd Tarkhān went off through the Gate of the Four Roads\r\nfor Bukhārā; Sl. `Alī Mīrzā and Darwesh Muḥ. Tarkhān were made\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nBāī-sunghar Mīrzā was in Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg's house when people brought\r\nDarwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān in. He put him a few questions but got no good\r\nanswer. In truth Darwesh Muḥammad's was a deed for which good answer\r\ncould not be made. He was ordered to death. In his helplessness he clung\r\nto a pillar[304] of the house; would they let him go because he clung to\r\na pillar? They made him reach his doom (_siyāsat_) and ordered Sl. `Alī\r\nMīrzā to the Gūk Sarāī there to have the fire-pencil drawn across his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note._) The Gūk Sarāī is one of Tīmūr Beg's great\r\n   buildings in the citadel of Samarkand. It has this singular\r\n   and special characteristic, if a Tīmūrid is to be seated on\r\n   the throne, here he takes his seat; if one lose his head,\r\n   coveting the throne, here he loses it; therefore the name Gūk\r\n   Sarāī has a metaphorical sense (_kināyat_) and to say of any\r\n   ruler's son, \"They have taken him to the Gūk Sarāī,\" means, to\r\n   death.[305]\r\n\r\nTo the Gūk Sarāī accordingly Sl. `Alī Mīrzā was taken but when the\r\nfire-pencil was drawn across his eyes, whether by the surgeon's choice\r\nor by his inadvertence, no harm was done. [Sidenote: Fol. 37b.] This the\r\nMīrzā did not reveal at once but went to Khwāja Yahya's house and a few\r\ndays later, to the Tarkhāns in Bukhārā.\r\n\r\nThrough these occurrences, the sons of his Highness Khwāja `Ubaidu'l-lāh\r\nbecame settled partisans, the elder (Muḥammad `Ubaidu'l-lāh, Khwājakī\r\nKhwāja) becoming the spiritual guide of the elder prince, the younger\r\n(Yahya) of the younger. In a few days, Khwāja Yahya followed Sl. `Alī\r\nMīrzā to Bukhārā.\r\n\r\nBāī-sunghar Mīrzā led out his army against Bukhārā. On his approach, Sl.\r\n`Alī Mīrzā came out of the town, arrayed for battle. There was little\r\nfighting; Victory being on the side of Sl. `Alī Mīrzā, Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā\r\nsustained defeat. Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg and a number of good soldiers were\r\ntaken; most of the men were put to death. Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg himself the\r\nslaves and slave-women of Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān, issuing out of\r\nBukhārā, put to a dishonourable death on the charge of their master's\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Bābur moves against Samarkand._)\r\n\r\nThese news reached us in Andijān in the month of Shawwāl (mid-June to\r\nmid-July) and as we (_act._ 14) coveted Samarkand, we got our men to\r\nhorse. Moved by a like desire, Sl. Mas'ūd Mīrzā, his mind and Khusrau\r\nShāh's mind set at ease by Sl. [Sidenote: Fol. 38.] Ḥusain Mīrzā's\r\nretirement, came over by way of Shahr-i-sabz.[306] To reinforce him,\r\nKhusrau Shāh laid hands (_qāptī_) on his younger brother, Walī. We\r\n(three mīrzās) beleaguered the town from three sides during three or\r\nfour months; then Khwāja Yahya came to me from Sl. `Alī Mīrzā to mediate\r\nan agreement with a common aim. The matter was left at an interview\r\narranged (_kūrūshmak_); I moved my force from Soghd to some 8m. below\r\nthe town; Sl. `Alī Mīrzā from his side, brought his own; from one bank,\r\nhe, from the other, I crossed to the middle of[307] the Kohik water,\r\neach with four or five men; we just saw one another (_kūrūshūb_), asked\r\neach the other's welfare and went, he his way, I mine.\r\n\r\nI there saw, in Khwāja Yahya's service, Mullā _Binā'ī_ and Muḥammad\r\nṢāliḥ;[308] the latter I saw this once, the former was long in my\r\nservice later on. After the interview (_kūrūshkān_) with Sl. `Alī Mīrzā,\r\nas winter was near and as there was no great scarcity amongst the\r\nSamarkandīs, we retired, he to Bukhārā, I to Andijān.\r\n\r\nSl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā had a penchant for a daughter of Shaikh `Abdu'l-lāh\r\n_Barlās_, she indeed was his object in coming to Samarkand. He took her,\r\nlaid world-gripping ambition aside [Sidenote: Fol. 38b.] and went back\r\nto Ḥiṣār.\r\n\r\nWhen I was near Shīrāz and Kān-bāī, Mahdī Sl. deserted to Samarkand;\r\nḤamza Sl. went also from near Zamīn but with leave granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n902 AH.—SEP. 9TH. 1496 TO AUG. 30TH. 1497 AD.[309]\r\n\r\n(_a. Bābur's second attempt on Samarkand._)\r\n\r\nThis winter, Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā's affairs were altogether in a good way.\r\nWhen `Abdu'l-karīm _Ushrit_ came on Sl. `Alī Mīrzā's part to near Kūfīn,\r\nMahdī Sl. led out a body of Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā's troops against him. The\r\ntwo commanders meeting exactly face to face, Mahdī Sl. pricked\r\n`Abdu'l-karīm's horse with his Chirkas[310] sword so that it fell, and\r\nas `Abdu'l-karīm was getting to his feet, struck off his hand at the\r\nwrist. Having taken him, they gave his men a good beating.\r\n\r\nThese (Aūzbeg) sulṯāns, seeing the affairs of Samarkand and the Gates of\r\nthe (Tīmūrid) Mīrzās tottering to their fall, went off in good time\r\n(_āīrtā_) into the open country (?)[311] for Shaibānī.\r\n\r\nPleased[312] with their small success (over `Abdu'l-karīm), the\r\nSamarkandīs drew an army out against Sl. `Alī Mīrzā; Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā\r\nwent to Sar-i-pul (Bridge-head), Sl. `Alī Mīrzā to Khwāja Kārzūn.\r\nMeantime, Khwāja Abū'l-makāram, at the instigation of Khwāja Munīr of\r\nAūsh, rode light against [Sidenote: Fol. 39.] Bukhārā with Wais\r\n_Lāgharī_ and Muḥammad Bāqir of the Andijān begs, and Qāsim _Dūldāī_ and\r\nsome of the Mīrzā's household. As the Bukhāriots took precautions when\r\nthe invaders got near the town, they could make no progress. They\r\ntherefore retired.\r\n\r\nAt the time when (last year) Sl. `Alī Mīrzā and I had our interview, it\r\nhad been settled[313] that this summer he should come from Bukhārā and I\r\nfrom Andijān to beleaguer Samarkand. To keep this tryst, I rode out in\r\nRamẓān (May) from Andijān. Hearing when close to Yār Yīlāq, that the\r\n(two) Mīrzās were lying front to front, we sent Tūlūn Khwāja\r\n_Mūghūl_[314] ahead, with 2 or 300 scouting braves (_qāzāq yīkītlār_).\r\nTheir approach giving Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā news of our advance, he at once\r\nbroke up and retired in confusion. That same night our detachment\r\novertook his rear, shot a mass (_qālīn_) of his men and brought in\r\nmasses of spoil.\r\n\r\nTwo days later we reached Shīrāz. It belonged to Qāsim Beg _Dūldāī_; his\r\n_dārogha_ (Sub-governor) could not hold it and surrendered.[315] It was\r\ngiven into Ibrāhīm _Sārū's_ charge. After making there, next day, the\r\nPrayer of the Breaking of the Fast (_`Īdu'l-fiṯr_), we moved for\r\nSamarkand and dismounted in the reserve (_qūrūgh_) of Āb-i-yār (Water of\r\nMight). That day waited on me with 3 or 400 men, Qāsim _Dūldāī_,\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 39b.] Wais _Lāgharī_, Muḥammad Sīghal's grandson,\r\nḤasan,[316] and Sl. Muḥammad Wais. What they said was this: 'Bāī-sunghar\r\nMīrzā came out and has gone back; we have left him therefore and are\r\nhere for the _pādshāh's_ service,' but it was known later that they must\r\nhave left the Mīrzā at his request to defend Shīrāz, and that the Shīrāz\r\naffair having become what it was, they had nothing for it but to come to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nWhen we dismounted at Qarā-būlāq, they brought in several Mughūls\r\narrested because of senseless conduct to humble village elders coming in\r\nto us.[317] Qāsim Beg _Qūchīn_ for discipline's sake (_siyāsat_) had\r\ntwo or three of them cut to pieces. It was on this account he left me\r\nand went to Ḥiṣār four or five years later, in the guerilla times, (907\r\nAH.) when I was going from the Macha country to The Khān.[318]\r\n\r\nMarching from Qarā-būlāq, we crossed the river (_i.e._ the Zar-afshān)\r\nand dismounted near Yām.[319] On that same day, our men got to grips\r\nwith Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā's at the head of the Avenue. Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_\r\nwas struck in the neck by a spear but not unhorsed. Khwājakī\r\nMullā-i-ṣadr, Khwāja-i-kalān's eldest brother, was pierced in the nape\r\nof the neck[320] by an arrow and went straightway to God's mercy. An\r\nexcellent soldier, my father before me had favoured him, making him\r\nKeeper of the Seal; he was a student of theology, had great [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 40.] acquaintance with words and a good style; moreover he\r\nundertook hawking and rain-making with the jade-stone.\r\n\r\nWhile we were at Yām, people, dealers and other, came out in crowds so\r\nthat the camp became a bazar for buying and selling. One day, at the\r\nOther Prayer, suddenly, a general hubbub arose and all those Musalmān\r\n(traders) were plundered. Such however was the discipline of our army\r\nthat an order to restore everything having been given, the first watch\r\n(_pahār_) of the next day had not passed before nothing, not a tag of\r\ncotton, not a broken needle's point, remained in the possession of any\r\nman of the force, all was back with its owners.\r\n\r\nMarching from Yām, it was dismounted in Khān Yūrtī (The Khān's Camping\r\nGround),[321] some 6 m. (3 _kuroh_) east of Samarkand. We lay there for\r\n40 or 50 days. During the time, men from their side and from ours\r\nchopped at one another (_chāpqū-lāshtīlār_) several times in the Avenue.\r\nOne day when Ibrāhīm _Begchīk_ was chopping away there, he was cut on\r\nthe face; thereafter people called him _Chāpūk_ (_Balafré_). Another\r\ntime, this also in the Avenue, at the Maghāk (Fosse) Bridge[322]\r\nAbū'l-qāsim (_Kohbur Chaghatāī_) got in with his mace. Once, again\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 40b.] in the Avenue, near the Mill-sluice, when Mīr Shāh\r\n_Qūchīn_ also got in with his mace, they cut his neck almost\r\nhalf-through; most fortunately the great artery was not severed.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in Khān Yūrtī, some in the fort sent the deceiving\r\nmessage,[323] 'Come you to-night to the Lovers' Cave side and we will\r\ngive you the fort.' Under this idea, we went that night to the Maghāk\r\nBridge and from there sent a party of good horse and foot to the\r\nrendezvous. Four or five of the household foot-soldiers had gone forward\r\nwhen the matter got wind. They were very active men; one, known as Ḥājī,\r\nhad served me from my childhood; another people called Maḥmūd\r\n_Kūndūr-sangak_.[324] They were all killed.\r\n\r\nWhile we lay in Khān Yūrtī, so many Samarkandīs came out that the camp\r\nbecame a town where everything looked for in a town was to be had.\r\nMeantime all the forts, Samarkand excepted, and the Highlands and the\r\nLowlands were coming in to us. As in Aūrgūt, however, a fort on the\r\nskirt of the Shavdār (var. Shādwār) range, a party of men held\r\nfast[325], of necessity we moved out from Khān Yūrtī against them. They\r\ncould not maintain themselves, and surrendered, making [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n41.] Khwāja-i-qāẓī their mediator. Having pardoned their offences\r\nagainst ourselves, we went back to beleaguer Samarkand.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Affairs of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā and his son, Badī`u'z-zamān\r\nMīrzā._)[326]\r\n\r\nThis year the mutual recriminations of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā and\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā led on to fighting; here are the particulars:—Last\r\nyear, as has been mentioned, Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā and Muz̤affar Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā had been made to kneel for Balkh and Astarābād. From that time\r\ntill this, many envoys had come and gone, at last even `Alī-sher Beg had\r\ngone but urge it as all did, Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā would not consent to\r\ngive up Astarābād. 'The Mīrzā,' he said, 'assigned[327] it to my son,\r\nMuḥammad Mū`min Mīrzā at the time of his circumcision.' A conversation\r\nhad one day between him and `Alī-sher Beg testifies to his acuteness and\r\nto the sensibility of `Alī-sher Beg's feelings. After saying many things\r\nof a private nature in the Mīrzā's ear, `Alī-sher Beg added, 'Forget\r\nthese matters.'[328] 'What matters?' rejoined the Mīrzā instantly.\r\n`Alī-sher Beg was much affected and cried a good deal.\r\n\r\nAt length the jarring words of this fatherly and filial discussion went\r\nso far that _his_ father against his father, and _his_ son against his\r\nson drew armies out for Balkh and Astarābād.[329]\r\n\r\nUp (from Harāt) to the Pul-i-chirāgh meadow, below Garzawān,[330] went\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā; down (from Balkh) came [Sidenote: Fol. 41b.]\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā. On the first day of Ramẓān (May 2nd.) Abū'l-muḥsin\r\nMīrzā advanced, leading some of his father's light troops. There was\r\nnothing to call a battle; Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā was routed and of his\r\nbraves masses were made prisoner. Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā ordered that all\r\nprisoners should be beheaded; this not here only but wherever he\r\ndefeated a rebel son, he ordered the heads of all prisoners to be struck\r\noff. And why not? Right was with him. The (rebel) Mīrzās were so given\r\nover to vice and social pleasure that even when a general so skilful and\r\nexperienced as their father was within half-a-day's journey of them, and\r\nwhen before the blessed month of Ramẓān, one night only remained, they\r\nbusied themselves with wine and pleasure, without fear of their father,\r\nwithout dread of God. Certain it is that those so lost (_yūtkān_) will\r\nperish and that any hand can deal a blow at those thus going to\r\nperdition (_aūtkān_). During the several years of Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's\r\nrule in Astarābād, his coterie and his following, his bare (_yālāng_)\r\nbraves even, were in full splendour[4] and adornment. He had many gold\r\nand silver drinking cups [Sidenote: Fol. 42.] and utensils, much silken\r\nplenishing and countless tīpūchāq horses. He now lost everything. He\r\nhurled himself in his flight down a mountain track, leading to a\r\nprecipitous fall. He himself got down the fall, with great difficulty,\r\nbut many of his men perished there.[331]\r\n\r\nAfter defeating Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā, Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā moved on to\r\nBalkh. It was in charge of Shaikh `Alī T̤aghāī; he, not able to defend\r\nit, surrendered and made his submission. The Mīrzā gave Balkh to Ibrāhīm\r\nḤusain Mīrzā, left Muḥammad Walī Beg and Shāh Ḥusain, the page, with him\r\nand went back to Khurāsān.\r\n\r\nDefeated and destitute, with his braves bare and his bare\r\nfoot-soldiers[332], Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā drew off to Khusrau Shāh in\r\nQūndūz. Khusrau Shāh, for his part, did him good service, such service\r\nindeed, such kindness with horses and camels, tents and pavilions and\r\nwarlike equipment of all sorts, both for himself and those with him,\r\nthat eye-witnesses said between this and his former equipment the only\r\ndifference might be in the gold and silver vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Dissension between Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā and Khusrau Shāh._)\r\n\r\nIll-feeling and squabbles had arisen between Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā and\r\nKhusrau Shāh because of the injustices of the one and the\r\nself-magnifyings of the other. Now therefore Khusrau Shāh joined his\r\nbrothers, Walī and Bāqī to Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā and sent the three\r\nagainst Ḥiṣār. They could not even [Sidenote: Fol. 42b.] get near the\r\nfort, in the outskirts swords were crossed once or twice; one day at the\r\nBird-house[333] on the north of Ḥiṣār, Muḥibb-`alī, the armourer\r\n(_qūrchī_), outstripped his people and struck in well; he fell from his\r\nhorse but at the moment of his capture, his men attacked and freed him.\r\nA few days later a somewhat compulsory peace was made and Khusrau Shāh's\r\narmy retired.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā drew off by the mountain-road\r\nto Ẕū'n-nūn _Arghūn_ and his son, Shujā` _Arghūn_ in Qandahār and\r\nZamīn-dāwar. Stingy and miserly as Ẕū'n-nūn was, he served the Mīrzā\r\nwell, in one single present offering 40,000 sheep.\r\n\r\nAmongst curious happenings of the time one was this: Wednesday was the\r\nday Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā beat Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā; Wednesday was the day\r\nMuz̤affar Ḥusain Mīrzā beat Muḥammad Mū`min Mīrzā; Wednesday, more\r\ncurious still, was the name of the man who unhorsed and took prisoner,\r\nMuḥammad Mū`min Mīrzā.[334]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n903 AH.—AUG. 30TH. 1497 TO AUG. 19TH. 1498 AD.[335]\r\n\r\n(_a. Resumed account of Bābur's second attempt on Samarkand._)\r\n\r\nWhen we had dismounted in the Qulba (Plough) meadow,[336] behind the\r\nBāgh-i-maidān (Garden of the plain), the Samarkandīs came out in great\r\nnumbers to near Muḥammad Chap's [Sidenote: Fol. 43.] Bridge. Our men\r\nwere unprepared; and before they were ready, Bābā `Alī's (son) Bābā Qulī\r\nhad been unhorsed and taken into the fort. A few days later we moved to\r\nthe top of Qulba, at the back of Kohik.[337] That day Sayyid Yūsuf,[338]\r\nhaving been sent out of the town, came to our camp and did me obeisance.\r\n\r\nThe Samarkandīs, fancying that our move from the one ground to the other\r\nmeant, 'He has given it up,' came out, soldiers and townsmen in alliance\r\n(through the Turquoise Gate), as far as the Mīrzā's Bridge and, through\r\nthe Shaikh-zāda's Gate, as far as Muḥammad Chap's. We ordered our braves\r\nto arm and ride out; they were strongly attacked from both sides, from\r\nMuḥammad Chap's Bridge and from the Mīrzā's, but God brought it right!\r\nour foes were beaten. Begs of the best and the boldest of braves our men\r\nunhorsed and brought in. Amongst them Ḥāfiẓ _Dūldāī's_ (son) Muḥammad\r\n_Mīskin_[339] was taken, after his index-finger had been struck off;\r\nMuḥammad Qāsim _Nabīra_ also was unhorsed and brought in by his own\r\nyounger brother, Ḥasan _Nabīra_.[340] There were many other such\r\nsoldiers and known men. Of the town-rabble, were brought in Diwāna, the\r\ntunic-weaver and _Kālqāshūq_,[341] headlong leaders both, in brawl and\r\ntumult; they [Sidenote: Fol. 43b.] were ordered to death with torture in\r\nblood-retaliation for our foot-soldiers, killed at the Lovers'\r\nCave.[342] This was a complete reverse for the Samarkandīs; they came\r\nout no more even when our men used to go to the very edge of the ditch\r\nand bring back their slaves and slave-women.\r\n\r\nThe Sun entered the Balance and cold descended on us.[343] I therefore\r\nsummoned the begs admitted to counsel and it was decided, after\r\ndiscussion, that although the towns-people were so enfeebled that, by\r\nGod's grace, we should take Samarkand, it might be to-day, it might be\r\nto-morrow, still, rather than suffer from cold in the open, we ought to\r\nrise from near it and go for winter-quarters into some fort, and that,\r\neven if we had to leave those quarters later on, this would be done\r\nwithout further trouble. As Khwāja Dīdār seemed a suitable fort, we\r\nmarched there and having dismounted in the meadow lying before it, went\r\nin, fixed on sites for the winter-houses and covered shelters,[344] left\r\noverseers and inspectors of the work and returned to our camp in the\r\nmeadow. There we lay during the few days before the winter-houses were\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nMeantime Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā had sent again and again to ask help from\r\nShaibānī Khān. On the morning of the very day on which, our quarters\r\nbeing ready, we had moved into Khwāja Dīdār, the Khān, having ridden\r\nlight from Turkistān, [Sidenote: Fol. 44.] stood over against our\r\ncamping-ground. Our men were not all at hand; some, for winter-quarters,\r\nhad gone to Khwāja Rabāṯī, some to Kabud, some to Shīrāz. None-the-less,\r\nwe formed up those there were and rode out. Shaibānī Khān made no stand\r\nbut drew off towards Samarkand. He went right up to the fort but because\r\nthe affair had not gone as Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā wished, did not get a good\r\nreception. He therefore turned back for Turkistān a few days later, in\r\ndisappointment, with nothing done.\r\n\r\nBāī-sunghar Mīrzā had sustained a seven months' siege; his one hope had\r\nbeen in Shaibānī Khān; this he had lost and he now with 2 or 300 of his\r\nhungry suite, drew off from Samarkand, for Khusrau Shāh in Qūndūz.\r\n\r\nWhen he was near Tīrmīẕ, at the Amū ferry, the Governor of Tīrmīẕ,\r\nSayyid Ḥusain Akbar, kinsman and confidant both of Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā,\r\nheard of him and went out against him. The Mīrzā himself got across the\r\nriver but Mīrīm Tarkhān was drowned and all the rest of his people were\r\ncaptured, together with his baggage and the camels loaded with his\r\npersonal effects; even his page, Muḥammad T̤āhir, falling into Sayyid\r\nḤusain Akbar's hands. Khusrau Shāh, for his part, looked kindly on the\r\nMīrzā.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 44b.] When the news of his departure reached us, we got\r\nto horse and started from Khwāja Dīdār for Samarkand. To give us\r\nhonourable meeting on the road, were nobles and braves, one after\r\nanother. It was on one of the last ten days of the first Rabī` (end of\r\nNovember 1497 AD.), that we entered the citadel and dismounted at the\r\nBū-stān Sarāī. Thus, by God's favour, were the town and the country of\r\nSamarkand taken and occupied.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Description of Samarkand._)[345]\r\n\r\nFew towns in the whole habitable world are so pleasant as Samarkand. It\r\nis of the Fifth Climate and situated in lat. 40° 6' and long. 99°.[346]\r\nThe name of the town is Samarkand; its country people used to call Mā\r\nwarā'u'n-nahr (Transoxania).\r\n\r\nThey used to call it _Baldat-i-maḥfūẓa_ because no foe laid hands on it\r\nwith storm and sack.[347] It must have become[348] Musalmān in the time\r\nof the Commander of the Faithful, his Highness `Usmān. Qus̤am ibn\r\n`Abbās, one of the Companions[349] must have gone there; his\r\nburial-place, known as the Tomb of Shāh-i-zinda (The Living Shāh,\r\n_i.e._, Fāqīr) is outside the Iron Gate. Iskandar must have founded\r\nSamarkand. The Turk and Mughūl hordes call it Sīmīz-kīnt.[350] Tīmūr Beg\r\nmade it his capital; no ruler so great will ever have made it a capital\r\nbefore (_qīlghān aīmās dūr_). I ordered people to pace round the\r\nramparts of the walled-town; it came out at 10,000 steps.[351]\r\nSamarkandīs are all orthodox (_sunnī_), pure-in-the Faith, law-abiding\r\nand religious. The number of Leaders [Sidenote: Fol. 45.] of Islām said\r\nto have arisen in Mā warā'u'n-nahr, since the days of his Highness the\r\nProphet, are not known to have arisen in any other country.[352] From\r\nthe Mātarīd suburb of Samarkand came Shaikh Abū'l-manṣūr, one of the\r\nExpositors of the Word.[353] Of the two sects of Expositors, the\r\nMātarīdiyah and the Ash`ariyah,[354] the first is named from this\r\nShaikh Abū'l-manṣūr. Of Mā warā'u'n-nahr also was Khwāja Ismā`īl\r\n_Khartank_, the author of the _Ṣāḥiḥ-i-bukhārī_.[355] From the Farghāna\r\ndistrict, Marghīnān—Farghāna, though at the limit of settled habitation,\r\nis included in Mā warā'u'n-nahr,—came the author of the _Hidāyat_,[356]\r\na book than which few on Jurisprudence are more honoured in the sect of\r\nAbū Ḥanīfa.\r\n\r\nOn the east of Samarkand are Farghāna and Kāshghar; on the west, Bukhārā\r\nand Khwārizm; on the north, Tāshkīnt and Shāhrukhiya,—in books written\r\nShāsh and Banākat; and on the south, Balkh and Tīrmīẕ.\r\n\r\nThe Kohik Water flows along the north of Samarkand, at the distance of\r\nsome 4 miles (2 _kuroh_); it is so-called because it comes out from\r\nunder the upland of the Little Hill (_Kohik_)[357] lying between it and\r\nthe town. The Dar-i-gham Water (canal) flows along the south, at the\r\ndistance of some two miles (1 _sharī`_). This is a large and swift\r\ntorrent,[358] indeed it is like a large river, cut off from the Kohik\r\nWater. All the gardens and suburbs and some of the _tūmāns_ of Samarkand\r\nare cultivated by it. By the Kohik Water a stretch of from 30 to 40\r\n_yīghāch_,[359] by road, is made habitable and cultivated, as far as\r\nBukhārā and Qarā-kūl. Large as the river is, it is not too large for\r\nits dwellings and its culture; during three or four months of the\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 45b.] year, indeed, its waters do not reach\r\nBukhārā.[360] Grapes, melons, apples and pomegranates, all fruits\r\nindeed, are good in Samarkand; two are famous, its apple and its\r\n_ṣāḥibī_ (grape).[361] Its winter is mightily cold; snow falls but not\r\nso much as in Kābul; in the heats its climate is good but not so good as\r\nKābul's.\r\n\r\nIn the town and suburbs of Samarkand are many fine buildings and gardens\r\nof Tīmur Beg and Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā.[362]\r\n\r\nIn the citadel,[363] Tīmūr Beg erected a very fine building, the great\r\nfour-storeyed kiosque, known as the Gūk Sarāī.[364] In the walled-town,\r\nagain, near the Iron Gate, he built a Friday Mosque[365] of stone\r\n(_sangīn_); on this worked many stone-cutters, brought from Hindūstān.\r\nRound its frontal arch is inscribed in letters large enough to be read\r\ntwo miles away, the Qu'rān verse, _Wa az yerfa` Ibrāhīm al Qawā`id alī\r\nakhara_.[366] This also is a very fine building. Again, he laid out two\r\ngardens, on the east of the town, one, the more distant, the\r\nBāgh-i-bulandī,[367] the other and nearer, the Bāgh-i-dilkushā.[368]\r\nFrom Dilkushā to the Turquoise Gate, he planted an Avenue of White\r\nPoplar,[369] and in the garden itself erected a great kiosque, painted\r\ninside [Sidenote: Fol. 46.] with pictures of his battles in Hindūstān.\r\nHe made another garden, known as the Naqsh-i-jahān (World's Picture), on\r\nthe skirt of Kohik, above the Qarā-sū or, as people also call it, the\r\nĀb-i-raḥmat (Water-of-mercy) of Kān-i-gil.[370] It had gone to ruin when\r\nI saw it, nothing remaining of it except its name. His also are the\r\nBāgh-i-chanār,[371] near the walls and below the town on the south,[372]\r\nalso the Bāgh-i-shamāl (North Garden) and the Bāgh-i-bihisht (Garden of\r\nParadise). His own tomb and those of his descendants who have ruled in\r\nSamarkand, are in a College, built at the exit (_chāqār_) of the\r\nwalled-town, by Muḥammad Sulṯān Mīrzā, the son of Tīmūr Beg's son,\r\nJahāngīr Mīrzā.[373]\r\n\r\nAmongst Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā's buildings inside the town are a College and a\r\nmonastery (_Khānqāh_). The dome of the monastery is very large, few so\r\nlarge are shown in the world. Near these two buildings, he constructed\r\nan excellent Hot Bath (_ḥammām_) known as the Mīrzā's Bath; he had the\r\npavements in this made of all sorts of stone (? mosaic); such another\r\nbath is not known in Khurāsān or in Samarkand.[374] [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n46b.] Again;—to the south of the College is his mosque, known as the\r\nMasjid-i-maqaṯa` (Carved Mosque) because its ceiling and its walls are\r\nall covered with _islīmī_[375] and Chinese pictures formed of segments\r\nof wood.[376] There is great discrepancy between the _qibla_ of this\r\nmosque and that of the College; that of the mosque seems to have been\r\nfixed by astronomical observation.\r\n\r\nAnother of Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā's fine buildings is an observatory, that is,\r\nan instrument for writing Astronomical Tables.[377] This stands three\r\nstoreys high, on the skirt of the Kohik upland. By its means the Mīrzā\r\nworked out the Kūrkānī Tables, now used all over the world. Less work is\r\ndone with any others. Before these were made, people used the Aīl-khānī\r\nTables, put together at Marāgha, by Khwāja Naṣīr _Tūsī_,[378] in the\r\ntime of Hulākū Khān. Hulākū Khān it is, people call _Aīl-khānī_.[379]\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note._) Not more than seven or eight observatories\r\n   seem to have been constructed in the world. Māmūm Khalīfa[380]\r\n   (Caliph) made one with which the _Mamūmī_ Tables were written.\r\n   Batalmūs (Ptolemy) constructed another. Another was made, in\r\n   Hindūstān, in the time of Rājā Vikramāditya _Hīndū_, in Ujjain\r\n   and Dhar, that is, the Mālwa country, now known as Māndū. The\r\n   Hindūs of Hindūstān use the Tables of this Observatory. They\r\n   were put together 1,584 years ago.[381] [Sidenote: Fol. 47.]\r\n   Compared with others, they are somewhat defective.\r\n\r\nAūlūgh Beg Mīrzā again, made the garden known as the Bāgh-i-maidān\r\n(Garden of the Plain), on the skirt of the Kohik upland. In the middle\r\nof it he erected a fine building they call Chihil Sitūn (Forty Pillars).\r\nOn both storeys are pillars, all of stone (_tāshdīn_).[382] Four\r\nturrets, like minarets, stand on its four corner-towers, the way up into\r\nthem being through the towers. Everywhere there are stone pillars, some\r\nfluted, some twisted, some many-sided. On the four sides of the upper\r\nstorey are open galleries enclosing a four-doored hall (_chār-dara_);\r\ntheir pillars also are all of stone. The raised floor of the building is\r\nall paved with stone.\r\n\r\nHe made a smaller garden, out beyond Chihil Sitūn and towards Kohik,\r\nalso having a building in it. In the open gallery of this building he\r\nplaced a great stone throne, some 14 or 15 yards (_qārī_) long, some 8\r\nyards wide and perhaps 1 yard high. They brought a stone so large by a\r\nvery long road.[383] There is a crack in the middle of it which people\r\nsay must have come after it was brought here. In the same [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 47b.] garden he also built a four-doored hall, know as the\r\nChīnī-khāna (Porcelain House) because its _īzāra_[384] are all of\r\nporcelain; he sent to China for the porcelain used in it. Inside the\r\nwalls again, is an old building of his, known as the Masjid-i-laqlaqa\r\n(Mosque of the Echo). If anyone stamps on the ground under the middle of\r\nthe dome of this mosque, the sound echoes back from the whole dome; it\r\nis a curious matter of which none know the secret.\r\n\r\nIn the time also of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā the great and lesser begs laid out\r\nmany gardens, large and small.[385] For beauty, and air, and view, few\r\nwill have equalled Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān's Chār-bāgh (Four\r\nGardens).[386] It lies overlooking the whole of Qulba Meadow, on the\r\nslope below the Bāgh-i-maidān. Moreover it is arranged symmetrically,\r\nterrace above terrace, and is planted with beautiful _nārwān_[387] and\r\ncypresses and white poplar. A most agreeable sojourning place, its one\r\ndefect is the want of a large stream.\r\n\r\nSamarkand is a wonderfully beautified town. One of its specialities,\r\nperhaps found in few other places,[388] is that the different trades are\r\nnot mixed up together in it but each has its own _bāzār_, a good sort of\r\nplan. Its bakers and its cooks are good. The best paper in the world is\r\nmade there; the water for the paper-mortars[389] all comes from\r\nKān-i-gil,[390] a meadow on the banks of the Qarā-sū (Blackwater) or\r\nĀb-i-raḥmat (Water of Mercy). [Sidenote: Fol. 48.] Another article of\r\nSamarkand trade, carried to all sides and quarters, is cramoisy velvet.\r\n\r\nExcellent meadows lie round Samarkand. One is the famous Kān-i-gil, some\r\n2 miles east and a little north of the town. The Qarā-sū or Āb-i-raḥmat\r\nflows through it, a stream (with driving power) for perhaps seven or\r\neight mills. Some say the original name of the meadow must have been\r\nKān-i-ābgīr (Mine of Quagmire) because the river is bordered by\r\nquagmire, but the histories all write Kān-i-gil (Mine of clay). It is an\r\nexcellent meadow. The Samarkand sulṯans always made it their\r\nreserve,[391] going out to camp in it each year for a month or two.\r\n\r\nHigher up (on the river) than Kān-i-gil and to the s.e. of it is a\r\nmeadow some 4 miles east of the town, known as Khān Yūrtī (Khān's\r\nCamping-ground). The Qarā-sū flows through this meadow before entering\r\nKān-i-gil. When it comes to Khān Yūrtī it curves back so far that it\r\nencloses, with a very narrow outlet, enough ground for a camp. Having\r\nnoticed these advantages, we camped there for a time during [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 48b.] the siege of Samarkand.[392]\r\n\r\nAnother meadow is the Būdana Qūrūgh (Quail Reserve), lying between\r\nDil-kushā and the town. Another is the Kūl-i-maghāk (Meadow of the deep\r\npool) at some 4 miles from the town. This also is a round[393] meadow.\r\nPeople call it Kul-i-maghāk meadow because there is a large pool on one\r\nside of it. Sl. `Alī Mīrzā lay here during the siege, when I was in Khān\r\nYūrtī. Another and smaller meadow is Qulba (Plough); it has Qulba\r\nVillage and the Kohik Water on the north, the Bāgh-i-maidān and Darwesh\r\nMuḥammad Tarkhān's Chār-bāgh on the south, and the Kohik upland on the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nSamarkand has good districts and _tūmāns_. Its largest district, and one\r\nthat is its equal, is Bukhārā, 25 _yīghāch_[394] to the west. Bukhārā in\r\nits turn, has several _tūmāns_; it is a fine town; its fruits are many\r\nand good, its melons excellent; none in Mā warā'u'n-nahr matching them\r\nfor quality and quantity. Although the Mīr Tīmūrī melon of Akhsī[395] is\r\nsweeter and more delicate than any Bukhārā melon, still in Bukhārā many\r\nkinds of melon are good and plentiful. The Bukhārā plum is famous; no\r\nother equals it. They skin it,[396] dry it and [Sidenote: Fol. 49.]\r\ncarry it from land to land with rarities (_tabarrūklār bīla_); it is an\r\nexcellent laxative medicine. Fowls and geese are much looked after\r\n(_parwārī_) in Bukhārā. Bukhārā wine is the strongest made in Mā\r\nwarā'u'n-nahr; it was what I drank when drinking in those countries at\r\nSamarkand.[397]\r\n\r\nKesh is another district of Samarkand, 9 _yīghāch_[398] by road to the\r\nsouth of the town. A range called the Aītmāk Pass (_Dābān_)[399] lies\r\nbetween Samarkand and Kesh; from this are taken all the stones for\r\nbuilding. Kesh is called also Shahr-i-sabz (Green-town) because its\r\nbarren waste (_ṣahr_) and roofs and walls become beautifully green in\r\nspring. As it was Tīmūr Beg's birth-place, he tried hard to make it his\r\ncapital. He erected noble buildings in it. To seat his own Court, he\r\nbuilt a great arched hall and in this seated his Commander-begs and his\r\nDīwān-begs, on his right and on his left. For those attending the Court,\r\nhe built two smaller halls, and to seat petitioners to his Court, built\r\nquite small recesses on the four sides of the Court-house.[400] Few\r\narches so fine can be shown in the world. It is said to be higher than\r\nthe Kisrī Arch.[401] Tīmūr Beg also built in Kesh a college and a\r\nmausoleum, in which are the tombs of Jahāngīr Mīrzā and others of his\r\ndescendants.[402] As Kesh did not offer the same facilities as\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 49b.] Samarkand for becoming a town and a capital, he\r\nat last made clear choice of Samarkand.\r\n\r\nAnother district is Qarshī, known also as Nashaf and Nakhshab.[403]\r\nQarshī is a Mughūl name. In the Mughūl tongue they call a _kūr-khāna_\r\nQarshī.[404] The name must have come in after the rule of Chīngīz Khān.\r\nQarshī is somewhat scantily supplied with water; in spring it is very\r\nbeautiful and its grain and melons are good. It lies 18 _yīghāch_[405]\r\nby road south and a little inclined to west of Samarkand. In the\r\ndistrict a small bird, known as the _qīl-qūyīrūgh_ and resembling the\r\n_bāghrī qarā_, is found in such countless numbers that it goes by the\r\nname of the Qarshī birdie (_murghak_).[406]\r\n\r\nKhozār is another district; Karmīna another, lying between Samarkand and\r\nBukhārā; Qarā-kūl another, 7 _yīghāch_[407] n.w. of Bukhārā and at the\r\nfurthest limit of the water.\r\n\r\nSamarkand has good _tūmāns_. One is Soghd with its dependencies. Its\r\nhead Yār-yīlāq, its foot Bukhārā, there may be not one single _yīghāch_\r\nof earth without its village and its cultivated lands. So famous is it\r\nthat the saying attributed to Tīmūr Beg, 'I have a garden 30 _yīghāch_\r\nlong,[408] must have been spoken of Soghd. Another _tūmān_ is Shāvdār\r\n(var. Shādwār), an excellent one adjoining the town-suburbs. On one side\r\nit has the range (Aītmāk Dābān), lying between Samarkand and [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 50.] Shahr-i-sabz, on the skirts of which are many of its villages.\r\nOn the other side is the Kohik Water (_i.e._ the Dar-i-gham canal).\r\nThere it lies! an excellent _tūmān_, with fine air, full of beauty,\r\nabounding in waters, its good things cheap. Observers of Egypt and Syria\r\nhave not pointed out its match.\r\n\r\nThough Samarkand has other _tūmāns_, none rank with those enumerated;\r\nwith so much, enough has been said.\r\n\r\nTīmūr Beg gave the government of Samarkand to his eldest son, Jahāngīr\r\nMīrzā (in 776 AH.-1375 AD.); when Jahāngīr Mīrzā died (805 AH.-1403\r\nAD.), he gave it to the Mīrzā's eldest son, Muḥammad Sulṯān-i-jahāngīr;\r\nwhen Muḥammad Sulṯān Mīrzā died, it went to Shāh-rukh Mīrzā, Tīmūr Beg's\r\nyoungest son. Shāh-rukh Mīrzā gave the whole of Mā warā'u'n-nahr (in 872\r\nAH.-1467 AD.) to his eldest son, Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā. From him his own son,\r\n`Abdu'l-laṯīf Mīrzā took it, (853 AH.-1449 AD.), for the sake of this\r\nfive days' fleeting world martyring a father so full of years and\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe following chronogram gives the date of Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā's death:—\r\n\r\n   Aūlūgh Beg, an ocean of wisdom and science,\r\n   The pillar of realm and religion,\r\n   Sipped from the hand of `Abbās, the mead of martyrdom,\r\n   And the date of the death is _`Abbās kasht_ (`Abbās slew).[409]\r\n\r\nThough `Abdu'l-laṯīf Mīrzā did not rule more than five or six months,\r\nthe following couplet was current about him:—\r\n\r\n   Ill does sovereignty befit the parricide;\r\n   Should he rule, be it for no more than six months.[410]\r\n\r\nThis chronogram of the death of `Abdu'l-laṯīf Mīrzā is also well done:—\r\n\r\n   `Abdu'l-laṯīf, in glory a Khusrau and Jamshīd, [Sidenote: Fol. 50b.]\r\n   In his train a Farīdūn and Zardusht,\r\n   Bābā Ḥusain slew on the Friday Eve,\r\n   With an arrow. Write as its date, _Bābā Ḥusain kasht_ (Bābā\r\n     Ḥusain slew).[411]\r\n\r\nAfter `Abdu'l-laṯīf Mīrzā's death, (Jumāda I, 22, 855 AH.-June 22nd.\r\n1450 AD.), (his cousin) `Abdu'l-lāh Mīrzā, the grandson of Shāh-rukh\r\nMīrzā through Ibrāhīm Mīrzā, seated himself on the throne and ruled for\r\n18 months to two years.[412] From him Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā took it (855\r\nAH.-1451 AD.). He in his life-time gave it to his eldest son, Sl. Aḥmad\r\nMīrzā; Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā continued to rule it after his father's death\r\n(873 AH.-1469 AD.). On his death (899 AH.-1494 AD.) Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā was\r\nseated on the throne and on his death (900 AH.-1495 AD.) Bāī-sunghar\r\nMīrzā. Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā was made prisoner for a few days, during the\r\nTarkhān rebellion (901 AH.-1496 AD.), and his younger brother, Sl. `Alī\r\nMīrzā was seated on the throne, but Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā, as has been\r\nrelated in this history, took it again directly. From Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā\r\nI took it (903 AH.-1497 AD.). Further details will be learned from the\r\nensuing history.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Bābur's rule in Samarkand._)\r\n\r\nWhen I was seated on the throne, I shewed the Samarkand begs precisely\r\nthe same favour and kindness they had had before. I bestowed rank and\r\nfavour also on the begs with me, [Sidenote: Fol. 51.] to each according\r\nto his circumstances, the largest share falling to Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_;\r\nhe had been in the household begs' circle; I now raised him to that of\r\nthe great begs.\r\n\r\nWe had taken the town after a seven months' hard siege. Things of one\r\nsort or other fell to our men when we got in. The whole country, with\r\nexception of Samarkand itself, had come in earlier either to me or to\r\nSl. `Alī Mīrzā and consequently had not been over-run. In any case\r\nhowever, what could have been taken from districts so long subjected to\r\nraid and rapine? The booty our men had taken, such as it was, came to an\r\nend. When we entered the town, it was in such distress that it needed\r\nseed-corn and money-advances; what place was this to take anything from?\r\nOn these accounts our men suffered great privation. We ourselves could\r\ngive them nothing. Moreover they yearned for their homes and, by ones\r\nand twos, set their faces for flight. The first to go was Bayān Qulī's\r\n(son) Khān Qulī; Ibrāhīm _Begchīk_ was another; all the Mughūls went off\r\nand, a little later, Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_.\r\n\r\nAūzūn Ḥasan counted himself a very sincere and faithful friend of\r\nKhwāja-i-qāẓī; we therefore, to put a stop to these desertions, sent the\r\nKhwāja to him (in Andijān) so that they, [Sidenote: Fol. 51b.] in\r\nagreement, might punish some of the deserters and send others back to\r\nus. But that very Aūzūn Ḥasan, that traitor to his salt, may have been\r\nthe stirrer-up of the whole trouble and the spur-to-evil of the\r\ndeserters from Samarkand. Directly Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_ had gone, all the\r\nrest took up a wrong position.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Andijān demanded of Bābur by The Khān, and also for Jahāngīr\r\nMīrzā._)\r\n\r\nAlthough, during the years in which, coveting Samarkand, I had\r\npersistently led my army out, Sl. Maḥmūd Khān[413] had provided me with\r\nno help whatever, yet, now it had been taken, he wanted Andijān.\r\nMoreover, Aūzūn Ḥasan and Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_, just when soldiers of ours\r\nand all the Mughūls had deserted to Andijān and Akhsī, wanted those two\r\ndistricts for Jahāngīr Mīrzā. For several reasons, those districts could\r\nnot be given to them. One was, that though not promised to The Khān, yet\r\nhe had asked for them and, as he persisted in asking, an agreement with\r\nhim was necessary, if they were to be given to Jahāngīr Mīrzā. A further\r\nreason was that to ask for them just when deserters from us had fled to\r\nthem, was very like a command. If the matter had been brought forward\r\nearlier, some way of tolerating a command might have been found. At\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 52.] the moment, as the Mughūls and the Andijān army and\r\nseveral even of my household had gone to Andijān, I had with me in\r\nSamarkand, beg for beg, good and bad, somewhere about 1000 men.\r\n\r\nWhen Aūzūn Ḥasan and Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_ did not get what they wanted,\r\nthey invited all those timid fugitives to join them. Just such a\r\nhappening, those timid people, for their own sakes, had been asking of\r\nGod in their terror. Hereupon, Aūzūn Ḥasan and Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_,\r\nbecoming openly hostile and rebellious, led their army from Akhsī\r\nagainst Andijān.\r\n\r\nTūlūn Khwāja was a bold, dashing, eager brave of the Bārīn (Mughūls). My\r\nfather had favoured him and he was still in favour, I myself having\r\nraised him to the rank of beg. In truth he deserved favour, a\r\nwonderfully bold and dashing brave! He, as being the man I favoured\r\namongst the Mughūls, was sent (after them) when they began to desert\r\nfrom Samarkand, to counsel the clans and to chase fear from their hearts\r\nso that [Sidenote: Fol. 52b.] they might not turn their heads to the\r\nwind.[414] Those two traitors however, those false guides, had so\r\nwrought on the clans that nothing availed, promise or entreaty, counsel\r\nor threat. Tūlūn Khwāja's march lay through Aīkī-sū-ārāsī,[415] known\r\nalso as Rabāṯik-aūrchīnī. Aūzūn Ḥasan sent a skirmishing party against\r\nhim; it found him off his guard, seized and killed him. This done, they\r\ntook Jahāngīr Mīrzā and went to besiege Andijān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Bābur loses Andijān._)\r\n\r\nIn Andijān when my army rode out for Samarkand, I had left Aūzūn Ḥasan\r\nand `Alī-dost T̤aghāī (Ramẓān 902 AH.-May 1497 AD.). Khwāja-i-qāẓī had\r\ngone there later on, and there too were many of my men from Samarkand.\r\nDuring the siege, the Khwāja, out of good-will to me, apportioned 18,000\r\nof his own sheep to the garrison and to the families of the men still\r\nwith me. While the siege was going on, letters kept coming to me from my\r\nmothers[416] and from the Khwāja, saying in effect, 'They are besieging\r\nus in this way; if at our cry of distress you do not come, things will\r\ngo all to ruin. Samarkand was taken [Sidenote: Fol. 53.] by the strength\r\nof Andijān; if Andijān is in your hands, God willing, Samarkand can be\r\nhad again.' One after another came letters to this purport. Just then I\r\nwas recovering from illness but, not having been able to take due care\r\nin the days of convalescence, I went all to pieces again and this time,\r\nbecame so very ill that for four days my speech was impeded and they\r\nused to drop water into my mouth with cotton. Those with me, begs and\r\nbare braves alike, despairing of my life, began each to take thought for\r\nhimself. While I was in this condition, the begs, by an error of\r\njudgment, shewed me to a servant of Aūzūn Ḥasan's, a messenger come with\r\nwild proposals, and then dismissed him. In four or five days, I became\r\nsomewhat better but still could not speak, in another few days, was\r\nmyself again.\r\n\r\nSuch letters! so anxious, so beseeching, coming from my mothers, that is\r\nfrom my own and hers, Aīsān-daulat Begīm, and from my teacher and\r\nspiritual guide, that is, Khwāja-i-maulānā-i-qāẓī, with what heart would\r\na man not move? We left Samarkand for Andijān on a Saturday in Rajab\r\n(Feb.-March), when I had ruled 100 days in the town. It was [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 53b.] Saturday again when we reached Khujand and on that day a\r\nperson brought news from Andijān, that seven days before, that is on the\r\nvery day we had left Samarkand, `Alī-dost T̤aghāī had surrendered\r\nAndijān.\r\n\r\nThese are the particulars;—The servant of Aūzūn Ḥasan who, after seeing\r\nme, was allowed to leave, had gone to Andijān and there said, 'The\r\n_pādshāh_ cannot speak and they are dropping water into his mouth with\r\ncotton.' Having gone and made these assertions in the ordinary way, he\r\ntook oath in `Alī-dost T̤aghāī's presence. `Alī-dost T̤aghāī was in the\r\nKhākān Gate. Becoming without footing through this matter, he invited\r\nthe opposite party into the fort, made covenant and treaty with them,\r\nand surrendered Andijān. Of provisions and of fighting men, there was no\r\nlack whatever; the starting point of the surrender was the cowardice of\r\nthat false and faithless manikin; what was told him, he made a pretext\r\nto put himself in the right.\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy, after taking possession of Andijān, heard of my arrival\r\nin Khujand, they martyred Khwāja-i-maulānā-i-qāẓī by hanging him, with\r\ndishonour, in the Gate of the citadel. [Sidenote: Fol. 54.] He had come\r\nto be known as Khwāja-maulānā-i-qāẓī but his own name was `Abdu'l-lāh.\r\nOn his father's side, his line went back to Shaikh Burhānu'd-dīn `Alī\r\n_Qīlīch_, on his mother's to Sl. Aīlīk _Māẓī_. This family had come to\r\nbe the Religious Guides (_muqtadā_) and pontiff (_Shaikhu'l-islām_) and\r\nJudge (_qāẓī_) in the Farghāna country.[417] He was a disciple of his\r\nHighness `Ubaidu'l-lāh (_Aḥrārī_) and from him had his upbringing. I\r\nhave no doubt he was a saint (_walī_); what better witnesses to his\r\nsanctity than the fact that within a short time, no sign or trace\r\nremained of those active for his death? He was a wonderful man; it was\r\nnot in him to be afraid; in no other man was seen such courage as his.\r\nThis quality is a further witness to his sanctity. Other men, however\r\nbold, have anxieties and tremours; he had none. When they had killed\r\nhim, they seized and plundered those connected with him, retainers and\r\nservants, tribesmen and followers.\r\n\r\nIn anxiety for Andijān, we had given Samarkand out of our hands; then\r\nheard we had lost Andijān. It was like the saying, 'In ignorance, made\r\nto leave this place, shut out from that' (_Ghafil az īn jā rānda, az ān\r\njā mānda_). It was very hard and vexing to me; for why? never since I\r\nhad ruled, had I been cut [Sidenote: Fol. 54b.] off like this from my\r\nretainers and my country; never since I had known myself, had I known\r\nsuch annoyance and such hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Bābur's action from Khujand as his base._)\r\n\r\nOn our arrival in Khujand, certain hypocrites, not enduring to see\r\nKhalīfa in my Gate, had so wrought on Muḥammad Ḥusain Mīrzā _Dūghlāt_\r\nand others that he was dismissed towards Tāshkīnt. To Tāshkīnt also\r\nQāsim Beg _Qūchīn_ had been sent earlier, in order to ask The Khān's\r\nhelp for a move on Andijān. The Khān consented to give it and came\r\nhimself by way of the Ahangarān Dale,[418] to the foot of the Kīndīrlīk\r\nPass.[419] There I went also, from Khujand, and saw my Khān dādā.[420]\r\nWe then crossed the pass and halted on the Akhsī side. The enemy for\r\ntheir part, gathered their men and went to Akhsī.\r\n\r\nJust at that time, the people in Pāp[421] sent me word they had made\r\nfast the fort but, owing to something misleading in The Khān's advance,\r\nthe enemy stormed and took it. Though The Khān had other good qualities\r\nand was in other ways businesslike, he was much without merit as a\r\nsoldier and commander. Just when matters were at the point that if he\r\nmade one more march, it was most probable the country would be had\r\nwithout fighting, at such a time! he gave ear to what the enemy said\r\nwith alloy of deceit, spoke of peace and, as his messengers, sent them\r\nKhwāja Abū'l-makāram and his own [Sidenote: Fol. 55.] Lord of the Gate,\r\nBeg _Tilba_ (Fool), _Taṃbal's_ elder brother. To save themselves those\r\nothers (_i.e._ Ḥasan and Taṃbal) mixed something true with what they\r\nfabled and agreed to give gifts and bribes either to The Khān or to his\r\nintermediaries. With this, The Khān retired.\r\n\r\nAs the families of most of my begs and household and braves were in\r\nAndijān, 7 or 800 of the great and lesser begs and bare braves, left us\r\nin despair of our taking the place. Of the begs were `Alī-darwesh Beg,\r\n`Alī-mazīd _Qūchīn_, Muḥammad Bāqir Beg, Shaikh `Abdu'l-lāh, Lord of the\r\nGate and Mīrīm _Lāgharī_. Of men choosing exile and hardship with me,\r\nthere may have been, of good and bad, between 200 and 300. Of begs there\r\nwere Qāsim _Qūchīn_ Beg, Wais _Lāgharī_ Beg, Ibrāhīm _Sārū Mīnglīgh_\r\nBeg, Shīrīm T̤aghāī, Sayyidī Qarā Beg; and of my household, Mīr Shāh\r\n_Qūchīn_, Sayyid Qāsim _Jalāīr_, Lord of the Gate, Qāsim-`ajab,\r\n`Alī-dost T̤aghāī's (son) Muḥammad-dost, Muḥammad-`alī _Mubashir_,[422]\r\nKhudāī-bīrdī _Tūghchī Mughūl_, Yārīk T̤aghāī, Bābā `Alī's (son) Bābā\r\nQulī, Pīr Wais, Shaikh Wais, [Sidenote: Fol. 55b.] Yār-`alī\r\n_Balāl_,[423] Qāsim _Mīr Akhwūr_ (Chief Equerry) and Ḥaidar _Rikābdār_\r\n(stirrup-holder).\r\n\r\nIt came very hard on me; I could not help crying a good deal. Back I\r\nwent to Khujand and thither they sent me my mother and my grandmother\r\nand the families of some of the men with me.\r\n\r\nThat Ramẓān (April-May) we spent in Khujand, then mounted for Samarkand.\r\nWe had already sent to ask The Khān's help; he assigned, to act with us\r\nagainst Samarkand, his son, Sl. Muḥammad (Sulṯānīm) Khānika and (his\r\nson's guardian) Aḥmad Beg with 4 or 5000 men and rode himself as far as\r\nAūrā-tīpā. There I saw him and from there went on by way of Yār-yīlāq,\r\npast the Būrka-yīlāq Fort, the head-quarters of the sub-governor\r\n(_dārogha_) of the district. Sl. Muḥammad Sulṯān and Aḥmad Beg, riding\r\nlight and by another road, got to Yār-yīlāq first but on their hearing\r\nthat Shaibānī Khān was raiding Shīrāz and thereabouts, turned back.\r\nThere was no help for it! Back I too had to go. Again I went to Khujand!\r\n\r\nAs there was in me ambition for rule and desire of conquest, I did not\r\nsit at gaze when once or twice an affair had made no progress. Now I\r\nmyself, thinking to make another move for [Sidenote: Fol. 56.] Andijān,\r\nwent to ask The Khān's help. Over and above this, it was seven or eight\r\nyears since I had seen Shāh Begīm[424] and other relations; they also\r\nwere seen under the same pretext. After a few days, The Khān appointed\r\nSayyid Muḥammad Ḥusain (_Dūghlāt_) and Ayūb _Begchīk_ and Jān-ḥasan\r\n_Bārīn_ with 7 or 8000 men to help us. With this help we started, rode\r\nlight, through Khujand without a halt, left Kand-i-badām on the left and\r\nso to Nasūkh, 9 or 10 _yīghāch_ of road beyond Khujand and 3 _yīghāch_\r\n(12-18 m.) from Kand-i-badām, there set our ladders up and took the\r\nfort. It was the melon season; one kind grown here, known as Ismā`īl\r\nShaikhī, has a yellow rind, feels like shagreen leather, has seeds like\r\nan apple's and flesh four fingers thick. It is a wonderfully delicate\r\nmelon; no other such grows thereabout. Next day the Mughūl begs\r\nrepresented to me, 'Our fighting men are few; to what would holding this\r\none fort lead on?' In truth they were right; of what use was it to make\r\nthat fort fast and stay there? Back once more to Khujand!\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Affairs of Khusrau Shāh and the Tīmūrid Mīrzās_.)[425]\r\n\r\nThis year Khusrau Shāh, taking Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā with him, led his army\r\n(from Qūndūz) to Chaghānīān and with false and treacherous intent, sent\r\nthis message to Ḥiṣār for Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā, 'Come, betake yourself to\r\nSamarkand; if [Sidenote: Fol. 56b.] Samarkand is taken, one Mīrzā may\r\nseat himself there, the other in Ḥiṣār.' Just at the time, the Mīrzā's\r\nbegs and household were displeased with him, because he had shewn\r\nexcessive favour to his father-in-law, Shaikh `Abdu'l-lāh _Barlās_ who\r\nfrom Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā had gone to him. Small district though Ḥiṣār is,\r\nthe Mīrzā had made the Shaikh's allowance 1,000 _tūmāns_ of _fulūs_[426]\r\nand had given him the whole of Khutlān in which were the holdings of\r\nmany of the Mīrzā's begs and household. All this Shaikh `Abdu'l-lāh had;\r\nhe and his sons took also in whole and in part, the control of the\r\nMīrzā's gate. Those angered began, one after the other, to desert to\r\nBāī-sunghar Mīrzā.\r\n\r\nBy those words of false alloy, having put Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā off his\r\nguard, Khusrau Shāh and Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā moved light out of Chaghānīān,\r\nsurrounded Ḥiṣār and, at beat of morning-drum, took possession of it.\r\nSl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā was in Daulat Sarāī, a house his father had built in\r\nthe suburbs. Not being able to get into the fort, he drew off towards\r\nKhutlān with Shaikh `Abu'l-lāh _Barlās_, parted from him half-way,\r\ncrossed the river at the Aūbāj ferry and betook himself to Sl. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā. Khusrau Shāh, having taken Ḥiṣār, set Bāī-sunghar [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n57.] Mīrzā on the throne, gave Khutlān to his own younger brother, Walī\r\nand rode a few days later, to lay siege to Balkh where, with many of his\r\nfather's begs, was Ibrāhīm Ḥusain Mīrzā (_Bāī-qarā_). He sent Naẕar\r\n_Bahādur_, his chief retainer, on in advance with 3 or 400 men to near\r\nBalkh, and himself taking Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā with him, followed and laid\r\nthe siege.\r\n\r\nWalī he sent off with a large force to besiege Shabarghān and raid and\r\nravage thereabouts. Walī, for his part, not being able to lay close\r\nsiege, sent his men off to plunder the clans and hordes of the Zardak\r\nChūl, and they took him back over 100,000 sheep and some 3000 camels. He\r\nthen came, plundering the Sān-chīrīk country on his way, and raiding and\r\nmaking captive the clans fortified in the hills, to join Khusrau Shāh\r\nbefore Balkh.\r\n\r\nOne day during the siege, Khusrau Shāh sent the Naẕar _Bahādur_ already\r\nmentioned, to destroy the water-channels[427] of [Sidenote: Fol. 57b.]\r\nBalkh. Out on him sallied Tīngrī-bīrdī _Samānchī_,[428] Sl. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā's favourite beg, with 70 or 80 men, struck him down, cut off his\r\nhead, carried it off, and went back into the fort. A very bold sally,\r\nand he did a striking deed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Affairs of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā and Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā._)\r\n\r\nThis same year, Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā led his army out to Bast and there\r\nencamped,[429] for the purpose of putting down Ẕū'n-nūn _Arghūn_ and his\r\nson, Shāh Shujā`, because they had become Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's\r\nretainers, had given him a daughter of Ẕū'n-nūn in marriage and taken up\r\na position hostile to himself. No corn for his army coming in from any\r\nquarter, it had begun to be distressed with hunger when the sub-governor\r\nof Bast surrendered. By help of the stores of Bast, the Mīrzā got back\r\nto Khurāsān.\r\n\r\nSince such a great ruler as Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā had twice led a splendid\r\nand well-appointed army out and twice retired, without taking Qūndūz, or\r\nḤiṣār or Qandahār, his sons and his begs waxed bold in revolt and\r\nrebellion. In the spring of this year, he sent a large army under\r\nMuḥammad Walī Beg to put down (his son) Muḥammad Ḥusain Mīrzā who,\r\nsupreme in Astarābād, had taken up a position hostile to himself. While\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā was still lying in the Nīshīn meadow (near Harāt), he\r\nwas surprised by Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā and Shāh Shujā` Beg (_Arghūn_). By\r\nunexpected good-fortune, he had been [Sidenote: Fol. 58.] joined that\r\nvery day by Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā, a refugee after bringing about the loss of\r\nḤiṣār,[430] and also rejoined by a force of his own returning from\r\nAstarābād. There was no question of fighting. Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā and\r\nShāh Beg, brought face to face with these armies, took to flight.\r\n\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā looked kindly on Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā, made him kneel as a\r\nson-in-law and gave him a place in his favour and affection.\r\nNone-the-less Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā, at the instigation of Bāqī\r\n_Chaghānīānī_, who had come earlier into Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's service,\r\nstarted off on some pretext, without asking leave, and went from the\r\npresence of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā to that of Khusrau Shāh!\r\n\r\nKhusrau Shāh had already invited and brought from Ḥiṣār, Bāī-sunghar\r\nMīrzā; to him had gone Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā's son,[431] Mīrān-shāh Mīrzā\r\nwho, having gone amongst the Hazāra in rebellion against his father, had\r\nbeen unable to remain amongst them because of his own immoderate acts.\r\nSome short-sighted persons were themselves ready to kill these three\r\n(Tīmūrid) Mīrzās and to read Khusrau Shāh's name in the _khuṯba_ but he\r\nhimself did not think this combination desirable. The ungrateful\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 58b.] manikin however, for the sake of gain in this five\r\ndays' fleeting world,—it was not true to him nor will it be true to any\r\nman soever,—seized that Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā whom he had seen grow up in his\r\ncharge from childhood, whose guardian he had been, and blinded him with\r\nthe lancet.\r\n\r\nSome of the Mīrzā's foster-brethren and friends of affection and old\r\nservants took him to Kesh intending to convey him to his (half)-brother\r\nSl. `Alī Mīrzā in Samarkand but as that party also (_i.e._ `Alī's)\r\nbecame threatening, they fled with him, crossed the river at the Aūbāj\r\nferry and went to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā.\r\n\r\nA hundred thousand curses light on him who planned and did a deed so\r\nhorrible! Up to the very verge of Resurrection, let him who hears of\r\nthis act of Khusrau Shāh, curse him; and may he who hearing, curses not,\r\nknow cursing equally deserved!\r\n\r\nThis horrid deed done, Khusrau Shāh made Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā ruler in\r\nḤiṣār and dismissed him; Mīrān-shāh Mīrzā he despatched for Bāmīān with\r\nSayyid Qāsim to help him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n904 AH.—AUG. 19TH. 1498 TO AUG. 8TH. 1499 AD.[432]\r\n\r\n(_a. Bābur borrows Pashāghar and leaves Khujand._)\r\n\r\nTwice we had moved out of Khujand, once for Andijān, once for Samarkand,\r\nand twice we had gone back to it because our work was not opened\r\nout.[433] Khujand is a poor place; a man with 2 or 300 followers would\r\nhave a hard time there; with [Sidenote: Fol. 59.] what outlook would an\r\nambitious man set himself down in it?\r\n\r\nAs it was our wish to return to Samarkand, we sent people to confer with\r\nMuḥammad Ḥusain _Kūrkān Dūghlāt_ in Aūrā-tīpā and to ask of him the loan\r\nfor the winter of Pashāghar where we might sit till it was practicable\r\nto make a move on Samarkand. He consenting, I rode out from Khujand for\r\nPashāghar.\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on Pashāghar._) Pashāghar is one of the\r\n   villages of Yār-yīlāq; it had belonged to his Highness the\r\n   Khwāja,[434] but during recent interregna,[435] it had become\r\n   dependent on Muḥammad Ḥusain Mīrzā.\r\n\r\nI had fever when we reached Zamīn, but spite of my fever we hurried off\r\nby the mountain road till we came over against Rabāṯ-i-khwāja, the\r\nhead-quarters of the sub-governor of the Shavdār _tūmān_, where we hoped\r\nto take the garrison at unawares, set our ladders up and so get into the\r\nfort. We reached it at dawn, found its men on guard, turned back and\r\nrode without halt to Pashāghar. The pains and misery of fever\r\nnotwithstanding, I had ridden 14 or 15 _yīghāch_ (70 to 80 miles).\r\n\r\nAfter a few days in Pashāghar, we appointed Ibrāhīm _Sārū_, [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 59b.] Wais _Lāgharī_, Sherīm T̤aghāī and some of the household and\r\nbraves to make an expedition amongst the Yār-yīlāq forts and get them\r\ninto our hands. Yār-yīlāq, at that time was Sayyid Yūsuf Beg's,[436] he\r\nhaving remained in Samarkand at the exodus and been much favoured by Sl.\r\n`Ali Mīrzā. To manage the forts, Sayyid Yūsuf had sent his younger\r\nbrother's son, Aḥmad-i-yūsuf, now[437] Governor of Sialkot, and\r\nAḥmad-i-yūsuf was then in occupation. In the course of that winter, our\r\nbegs and braves made the round, got possession of some of the forts\r\npeacefully, fought and took others, gained some by ruse and craft. In\r\nthe whole of that district there is perhaps not a single village without\r\nits defences because of the Mughūls and the Aūzbegs. Meantime Sl. `Alī\r\nMīrzā became suspicious of Sayyid Yūsuf and his nephew on my account and\r\ndismissed both towards Khurāsān.\r\n\r\nThe winter passed in this sort of tug-of-war; with the oncoming\r\nheats,[438] they sent Khwāja Yaḥya to treat with me, while they, urged\r\non by the (Samarkand) army, marched out to near Shīrāz and Kabud. I may\r\nhave had 200 or 300 soldiers (_sipāhī_); powerful foes were on my every\r\nside; Fortune had [Sidenote: Fol. 60.] not favoured me when I turned to\r\nAndijān; when I put a hand out for Samarkand, no work was opened out. Of\r\nnecessity, some sort of terms were made and I went back from Pashāghar.\r\n\r\nKhujand is a poor place; one beg would have a hard time in it; there we\r\nand our families and following had been for half a year[439] and during\r\nthe time the Musalmāns of the place had not been backward in bearing our\r\ncharges and serving us to the best of their power. With what face could\r\nwe go there again? and what, for his own part, could a man do there? 'To\r\nwhat home to go? For what gain to stay?'[440]\r\n\r\nIn the end and with the same anxieties and uncertainty, we went to the\r\nsummer-pastures in the south of Aūrā-tīpā. There we spent some days in\r\namazement at our position, not knowing where to go or where to stay, our\r\nheads in a whirl. On one of those days, Khwāja Abū'l-makāram came to see\r\nme, he like me, a wanderer, driven from his home.[441] He questioned us\r\nabout our goings and stayings, about what had or had not been done and\r\nabout our whole position. He was touched with compassion for our state\r\nand recited the _fātiḥa_ for me before he left. I also was much touched;\r\nI pitied him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Bābur recovers Marghīnān._)\r\n\r\nNear the Afternoon Prayer of that same day, a horseman appeared at the\r\nfoot of the valley. He was a man named Yūl-chūq, presumably `Ali-dost\r\nT̤aghāī's own servant, and had been sent with this written message,\r\n'Although many great misdeeds have had their rise in me, yet, if you\r\nwill do me the [Sidenote: Fol. 60b.] favour and kindness of coming to\r\nme, I hope to purge my offences and remove my reproach, by giving you\r\nMarghīnān and by my future submission and single-minded service.'\r\n\r\nSuch news! coming on such despair and whirl-of-mind! Off we hurried,\r\nthat very hour,—it was sun-set,—without reflecting, without a moment's\r\ndelay, just as if for a sudden raid, straight for Marghīnān. From where\r\nwe were to Marghīnān may have been 24 or 25 _yīghāch_ of road.[442]\r\nThrough that night it was rushed without delaying anywhere, and on next\r\nday till at the Mid-day Prayer, halt was made at Tang-āb (Narrow-water),\r\none of the villages of Khujand. There we cooled down our horses and gave\r\nthem corn. We rode out again at beat of (twilight-) drum[443] and on\r\nthrough that night till shoot of dawn, and through the next day till\r\nsunset, and on through that night till, just before dawn, we were one\r\n_yīghāch_ from Marghīnān. Here Wais Beg and others represented to me\r\nwith some anxiety what sort of an evil-doer `Ali-dost was. 'No-one,'\r\nthey said, 'has come and gone, time and again, between him and us; no\r\nterms and compact have been made; trusting to what are we going?' In\r\ntruth their fears were just! After waiting awhile to consult, we at last\r\nagreed that [Sidenote: Fol. 61.] reasonable as anxiety was, it ought to\r\nhave been earlier; that there we were after coming three nights and two\r\ndays without rest or halt; in what horse or in what man was any strength\r\nleft?—from where we were, how could return be made? and, if made, where\r\nwere we to go?—that, having come so far, on we must, and that nothing\r\nhappens without God's will. At this we left the matter and moved on, our\r\ntrust set on Him.\r\n\r\nAt the Sunnat Prayer[444] we reached Fort Marghīnān. `Alī-dost T̤aghāī\r\nkept himself behind (_arqa_) the closed gate and asked for terms; these\r\ngranted, he opened it. He did me obeisance between the (two) gates.[445]\r\nAfter seeing him, we dismounted at a suitable house in the walled-town.\r\nWith me, great and small, were 240 men.\r\n\r\nAs Aūzūn Ḥasan and Taṃbal had been tyrannical and oppressive, all the\r\nclans of the country were asking for me. We therefore, after two or\r\nthree days spent in Marghīnān, joined to Qāsim Beg over a hundred men of\r\nthe Pashāgharīs, the new retainers of Marghīnān and of `Alī-dost's\r\nfollowing, and sent them to bring over to me, by force or fair words,\r\nsuch hill-people of the south of Andijān as the Ashpārī, Tūrūqshār,\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 61b.] Chīkrāk and others roundabout. Ibrāhīm Sārū and\r\nWais _Lāgharī_ and Sayyidī Qarā were also sent out, to cross the\r\nKhujand-water and, by whatever means, to induce the people on that side\r\nto turn their eyes to me.\r\n\r\nAūzūn Ḥasan and Taṃbal, for their parts, gathered together what soldiers\r\nand Mughūls they had and called up the men accustomed to serve in the\r\nAndijān and Akhsī armies. Then, bringing Jahāngīr Mīrzā with them, they\r\ncame to Sapān, a village 2 m. east of Marghīnān, a few days after our\r\narrival, and dismounted there with the intention of besieging Marghīnān.\r\nThey advanced a day or two later, formed up to fight, as far as the\r\nsuburbs. Though after the departure of the Commanders, Qāsim Beg,\r\nIbrāhīm _Sārū_ and Wais _Lāgharī_, few men were left with me, those\r\nthere were formed up, sallied out and prevented the enemy from advancing\r\nbeyond the suburbs. On that day, Page Khalīl, the turban-twister, went\r\nwell forward and got his hand into the work. They had come; they could\r\ndo nothing; on two other days they failed to get near the fort.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 62.]\r\n\r\nWhen Qāsim Beg went into the hills on the south of Andijān, all the\r\nAshpārī, Tūrūqshār, Chīkrāk, and the peasants and highland and lowland\r\nclans came in for us. When the Commanders, Ibrāhīm _Sārū_ and Wais\r\n_Lāgharī_, crossed the river to the Akhsī side, Pāp and several other\r\nforts came in.\r\n\r\nAūzūn Ḥasan and Taṃbal being the heathenish and vicious tyrants they\r\nwere, had inflicted great misery on the peasantry and clansmen.\r\nOne of the chief men of Akhsī, Ḥasan-dīkcha by name,[446] gathered\r\ntogether his own following and a body of the Akhsī mob and rabble,\r\nblack-bludgeoned[447] Aūzūn Ḥasan's and Taṃbal's men in the outer fort\r\nand drubbed them into the citadel. They then invited the Commanders,\r\nIbrāhīm _Sārū_, Wais _Lāgharī_ and Sayyidī Qarā and admitted them into\r\nthe fort.\r\n\r\nSl. Maḥmūd Khān had appointed to help us, Ḥaidar _Kūkūldāsh's_ (son)\r\nBanda-`alī and Ḥājī Ghāzī _Manghīt_,[448] the latter just then a\r\nfugitive from Shaibānī Khān, and also the Bārīn _tūmān_ with its begs.\r\nThey arrived precisely at this time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 62b.] These news were altogether upsetting to Aūzūn\r\nḤasan; he at once started off his most favoured retainers and most\r\nserviceable braves to help his men in the citadel of Akhsī. His force\r\nreached the brow of the river at dawn. Our Commanders and the (Tāshkīnt)\r\nMughūls had heard of its approach and had made some of their men strip\r\ntheir horses and cross the river (to the Andijān side). Aūzūn Ḥasan's\r\nmen, in their haste, did not draw the ferry-boat up-stream;[449] they\r\nconsequently went right away from the landing-place, could not cross for\r\nthe fort and went down stream.[450] Here-upon, our men and the\r\n(Tāshkīnt) Mughūls began to ride bare-back into the water from both\r\nbanks. Those in the boat could make no fight at all. Qārlūghāch (var.\r\nQārbūghāch) _Bakhshī_ (Pay-master) called one of Mughūl Beg's sons to\r\nhim, took him by the hand, chopped at him and killed him. Of what use\r\nwas it? The affair was past that! His act was the cause why most of\r\nthose in the boat went to their death. Instantly our men seized them all\r\n(_arīq_) and killed all (but a few).[451] Of Aūzūn Ḥasan's confidants\r\nescaped Qārlūghāch _Bakhshī_ and Khalīl _Dīwān_ and Qāẓī _Ghulām_, the\r\nlast getting off by pretending to be a slave (_ghulām_); and of his\r\ntrusted braves, Sayyid `Alī, now in trust in my own service,[452] and\r\nḤaidar-i-qulī and Qilka _Kāshgharī_ escaped. Of his 70 or 80 men, no\r\nmore than this [Sidenote: Fol. 63.] same poor five or six got free.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of this affair, Aūzūn Ḥasan and Taṃbal, not being able to\r\nremain near Marghīnān, marched in haste and disorder for Andijān. There\r\nthey had left Nāṣir Beg, the husband of Aūzūn Ḥasan's sister. He, if not\r\nAūzūn Ḥasan's second, what question is there he was his third?[453] He\r\nwas an experienced man, brave too; when he heard particulars, he knew\r\ntheir ground was lost, made Andijān fast and sent a man to me. They\r\nbroke up in disaccord when they found the fort made fast against them;\r\nAūzūn Ḥasan drew off to his wife in Akhsī, Taṃbal to his district of\r\nAūsh. A few of Jahāngīr Mīrzā's household and braves fled with him from\r\nAūzūn Ḥasan and joined Taṃbal before he had reached Aūsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Bābur recovers Andijān._)\r\n\r\nDirectly we heard that Andijān had been made fast against them, I rode\r\nout, at sun-rise, from Marghīnān and by mid-day was in Andijān.[454]\r\nThere I saw Nāṣir Beg and his two sons, that is to say, Dost Beg and\r\nMīrīm Beg, questioned them and uplifted their heads with hope of favour\r\nand kindness. In this way, by God's grace, my father's country, lost to\r\nme for two years, was regained and re-possessed, in the month Ẕū'l-qa`da\r\nof [Sidenote: Fol. 63b.] the date 904 (June 1498).[455]\r\n\r\nSl. Aḥmad Taṃbal, after being joined by Jahāngīr Mīrzā, drew away for\r\nAūsh. On his entering the town, the red rabble (_qīzīl ayāq_) there, as\r\nin Akhsī, black-bludgeoned (_qarā tīyāq qīlīb_) and drubbed his men out,\r\nblow upon blow, then kept the fort for me and sent me a man. Jahāngīr\r\nand Taṃbal went off confounded, with a few followers only, and entered\r\nAūzkīnt Fort.\r\n\r\nOf Aūzūn Ḥasan news came that after failing to get into Andijān, he had\r\ngone to Akhsī and, it was understood, had entered the citadel. He had\r\nbeen head and chief in the rebellion; we therefore, on getting this\r\nnews, without more than four or five days' delay in Andijān, set out for\r\nAkhsī. On our arrival, there was nothing for him to do but ask for peace\r\nand terms, and surrender the fort.\r\n\r\nWe stayed in Akhsī[456] a few days in order to settle its affairs and\r\nthose of Kāsān and that country-side. We gave the Mughūls who had come\r\nin to help us, leave for return (to Tāshkīnt), then went back to\r\nAndijān, taking with us Aūzūn Ḥasan and his family and dependants. In\r\nAkhsī was left, for a time, Qāsim-i-`ajab (Wonderful Qāsim), formerly\r\none of the household circle, now arrived at beg's rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Renewed rebellion of the Mughūls._)\r\n\r\nAs terms had been made, Aūzūn Ḥasan, without hurt to life [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 64.] or goods, was allowed to go by the Qarā-tīgīn road for Ḥiṣār.\r\nA few of his retainers went with him, the rest parted from him and\r\nstayed behind. These were the men who in the throneless times had\r\ncaptured and plundered various Musalmān dependants of my own and of the\r\nKhwāja. In agreement with several begs, their affair was left at\r\nthis;—'This very band have been the captors and plunderers of our\r\nfaithful Musalmān dependants;[457] what loyalty have they shown to their\r\nown (Mughūl) begs that they should be loyal to us? If we had them seized\r\nand stripped bare, where would be the wrong? and this especially because\r\nthey might be going about, before our very eyes, riding our horses,\r\nwearing our coats, eating our sheep. Who could put up with that? If, out\r\nof humanity, they are not imprisoned and not plundered, they certainly\r\nought to take it as a favour if they get off with the order to give back\r\nto our companions of the hard guerilla times, whatever goods of theirs\r\nare known to be here.'\r\n\r\nIn truth this seemed reasonable; our men were ordered to take what they\r\nknew to be theirs. Reasonable and just though the order was, (I now)\r\nunderstand that it was a little hasty. [Sidenote: Fol. 64b.] With a\r\nworry like Jahāngīr seated at my side, there was no sense in frightening\r\npeople in this way. In conquest and government, though many things may\r\nhave an outside appearance of reason and justice, yet 100,000\r\nreflections are right and necessary as to the bearings of each one of\r\nthem. From this single incautious order of ours,[458] what troubles!\r\nwhat rebellions arose! In the end this same ill-considered order was\r\nthe cause of our second exile from Andijān. Now, through it, the Mughūls\r\ngave way to anxiety and fear, marched through Rabāṯik-aūrchīnī, that is,\r\nAīkī-sū-ārāsī, for Aūzkīnt and sent a man to Taṃbal.\r\n\r\nIn my mother's service were 1500 to 2000 Mughūls from the horde; as many\r\nmore had come from Ḥiṣār with Ḥamza Sl. and Mahdī Sl. and Muḥammad\r\n_Dūghlāt Ḥiṣārī_.[459] Mischief and devastation must always be expected\r\nfrom the Mughūl horde. Up to now[460] they have rebelled five times\r\nagainst me. It must not be understood that they rebelled through not\r\ngetting on with me; they have done the same thing with their own Khāns,\r\nagain and again. Sl. Qulī _Chūnāq_[461] brought me the news. His late\r\nfather, Khudāī-bīrdī _Būqāq_[462] I had favoured amongst the Mughūls; he\r\nwas himself with the (rebel) Mughūls [Sidenote: Fol. 65.] and he did\r\nwell in thus leaving the horde and his own family to bring me the news.\r\nWell as he did then however, he, as will be told,[463] did a thing so\r\nshameful later on that it would hide a hundred such good deeds as this,\r\nif he had done them. His later action was the clear product of his\r\nMughūl nature. When this news came, the begs, gathered for counsel,\r\nrepresented to me, 'This is a trifling matter; what need for the pādshāh\r\nto ride out? Let Qāsim Beg go with the begs and men assembled here.' So\r\nit was settled; they took it lightly; to do so must have been an error\r\nof judgment. Qāsim Beg led his force out that same day; Taṃbal meantime\r\nmust have joined the Mughūls. Our men crossed the Aīlāīsh river[464]\r\nearly next morning by the Yāsī-kījīt (Broad-crossing) and at once came\r\nface to face with the rebels. Well did they chop at one another\r\n(_chāpqūlāshūrlār_)! Qāsim Beg himself came face to face with Muḥammad\r\n_Arghūn_ and did not desist from chopping at him in order to cut off his\r\nhead.[465] Most of our braves exchanged [Sidenote: Fol. 65b.] good blows\r\nbut in the end were beaten. Qāsim Beg, `Alī-dost T̤aghāī, Ibrāhīm\r\n_Sārū_, Wais _Lāgharī_, Sayyidī Qarā and three or four more of our begs\r\nand household got away but most of the rest fell into the hands of the\r\nrebels. Amongst them were `Alī-darwesh Beg and Mīrīm _Lāgharī_ and\r\n(Sherīm?) T̤aghāī Beg's (son) Tūqā[466] and `Alī-dost's son,\r\nMuḥammad-dost and Mīr Shāh _Qūchīn_ and Mīrīm Dīwān.\r\n\r\nTwo braves chopped very well at one another; on our side, Samad, Ibrāhīm\r\n_Sārū's_ younger brother, and on their side, Shāh-suwār, one of the\r\nḤiṣārī Mughūls. Shāh-suwār struck so that his sword drove through\r\nSamad's helm and seated itself well in his head; Samad, spite of his\r\nwound, struck so that his sword cut off Shāh-suwār's head a piece of\r\nbone as large as the palm of a hand. Shāh-suwār must have worn no helm;\r\nthey trepanned his head and it healed; there was no one to trepan\r\nSamad's and in a few days, he departed simply through the wound.[467]\r\n\r\nAmazingly unseasonable was this defeat, coming as it did just in the\r\nrespite from guerilla fighting and just when we had regained the\r\ncountry. One of our great props, Qaṃbar-`alī _Mughūl_ (the Skinner) had\r\ngone to his district when Andijān [Sidenote: Fol. 66.] was occupied and\r\ntherefore was not with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Taṃbal attempts to take Andijān._)\r\n\r\nHaving effected so much, Taṃbal, bringing Jahāngīr Mīrzā with him, came\r\nto the east of Andijān and dismounted 2 miles off, in the meadow lying\r\nin front of the Hill of Pleasure (`Aīsh).[468]\r\n\r\nOnce or twice he advanced in battle-array, past Chihil-dukhterān[469]\r\nto the town side of the hill but, as our braves went out arrayed to\r\nfight, beyond the gardens and suburbs, he could not advance further and\r\nreturned to the other side of the hill. On his first coming to those\r\nparts, he killed two of the begs he had captured, Mīrīm _Lāgharī_ and\r\nTūqā Beg. For nearly a month he lay round-about without effecting\r\nanything; after that he retired, his face set for Aūsh. Aūsh had been\r\ngiven to Ibrāhīm _Sārū_ and his man in it now made it fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n905 AH. AUG. 8TH. 1499 TO JULY 28TH. 1500 AD.[470]\r\n\r\n(_a. Bābur's campaign against Aḥmad Taṃbal Mughūl._)\r\n\r\n\r\nCommissaries were sent gallopping off at once, some to call up the horse\r\nand foot of the district-armies, others to urge return on Qaṃbar-`alī\r\nand whoever else was away in his own district, while energetic people\r\nwere told off to get together mantelets (_tūra_), shovels, axes and the\r\nwhat-not of war-material and stores for the men already with us.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the horse and foot, called up from the various districts to\r\njoin the army, and the soldiers and retainers who had been scattered to\r\nthis and that side on their own affairs, were gathered together, I went\r\nout, on Muḥarram 18th. (August 25th.), putting my trust in God, to Ḥāfiẓ\r\nBeg's Four-gardens [Sidenote: Fol. 66b.] and there stayed a few days in\r\norder to complete our equipment. This done, we formed up in array of\r\nright and left, centre and van, horse and foot, and started direct for\r\nAūsh against our foe.\r\n\r\nOn approaching Aūsh, news was had that Taṃbal, unable to make stand in\r\nthat neighbourhood, had drawn off to the north, to the Rabāṯ-i-sarhang\r\nsub-district, it was understood. That night we dismounted in Lāt-kīnt.\r\nNext day as we were passing through Aūsh, news came that Taṃbal was\r\nunderstood to have gone to Andijān. We, for our part, marched on as for\r\nAūzkīnt, detaching raiders ahead to over-run those parts.[471] Our\r\nopponents went to Andijān and at night got into the ditch but being\r\ndiscovered by the garrison when they set their ladders up against the\r\nramparts, could effect no more and retired. Our raiders retired also\r\nafter over-running round about Aūzkīnt without getting into their hands\r\nanything worth their trouble.\r\n\r\nTaṃbal had stationed his younger brother, Khalīl, with 200 or 300 men,\r\nin Māḏū,[472] one of the forts of Aūsh, renowned in that centre (_ārā_)\r\nfor its strength. We turned back (on the [Sidenote: Fol. 67.] Aūzkīnt\r\nroad) to assault it. It is exceedingly strong. Its northern face stands\r\nvery high above the bed of a torrent; arrows shot from the bed might\r\nperhaps reach the ramparts. On this side is the water-thief,[473] made\r\nlike a lane, with ramparts on both sides carried from the fort to the\r\nwater. Towards the rising ground, on the other sides of the fort, there\r\nis a ditch. The torrent being so near, those occupying the fort had\r\ncarried stones in from it as large as those for large mortars.[474] From\r\nno fort of its class we have ever attacked, have stones been thrown so\r\nlarge as those taken into Māḏū. They dropped such a large one on\r\n`Abdu'l-qāsim _Kohbur_, Kitta (Little) Beg's elder brother,[475] when he\r\nwent up under the ramparts, that he spun head over heels and came\r\nrolling and rolling, without once getting to his feet, from that great\r\nheight down to the foot of the glacis (_khāk-rez_). He did not trouble\r\nhimself about it at all but just got on his horse and rode off. Again, a\r\nstone flung from the double water-way, hit Yār-`alī _Balāl_ so hard on\r\nthe head that in the end it had to be trepanned.[476] Many of our men\r\nperished by their stones. The assault began at dawn; the water-thief\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 67b.] had been taken before breakfast-time;[477]\r\nfighting went on till evening; next morning, as they could not hold out\r\nafter losing the water-thief, they asked for terms and came out. We took\r\n60 or 70 or 80 men of Khalīl's command and sent them to Andijān for\r\nsafe-keeping; as some of our begs and household were prisoners in their\r\nhands, the Māḏū affair fell out very well.[478]\r\n\r\nFrom there we went to Unjū-tūpa, one of the villages of Aūsh, and there\r\ndismounted. When Taṃbal retired from Andijān and went into the\r\nRabāṯ-i-sarhang sub-district, he dismounted in a village called\r\nĀb-i-khān. Between him and me may have been one _yīghāch_ (5 m.?). At\r\nsuch a time as this, Qaṃbar-`alī (the Skinner) on account of some\r\nsickness, went into Aūsh.\r\n\r\nIt was lain in Unjū-tūpa a month or forty days without a battle, but day\r\nafter day our foragers and theirs got to grips. All through the time our\r\ncamp was mightily well watched at night; a ditch was dug; where no ditch\r\nwas, branches were set close together;[479] we also made our soldiers go\r\nout in their mail [Sidenote: Fol. 68.] along the ditch. Spite of such\r\nwatchfulness, a night-alarm was given every two or three days, and the\r\ncry to arms went up. One day when Sayyidī Beg T̤aghāī had gone out with\r\nthe foragers, the enemy came up suddenly in greater strength and took\r\nhim prisoner right out of the middle of the fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā murdered by Khusrau Shāh._)\r\n\r\nKhusrau Shāh, having planned to lead an army against Balkh, in this same\r\nyear invited Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā to go with him, brought him[480] to\r\nQūndūz and rode out with him for Balkh. But when they reached the Aubāj\r\nferry, that ungrateful infidel, Khusrau Shāh, in his aspiration to\r\nsovereignty,—and to what sort of sovereignty, pray, could such a no-body\r\nattain? a person of no merit, no birth, no lineage, no judgment, no\r\nmagnanimity, no justice, no legal-mindedness,—laid hands on Bāī-sunghar\r\nMīrzā with his begs, and bowstrung the Mīrzā. It was upon the 10th. of\r\nthe month of Muḥarram (August 17th.) that he martyred that scion of\r\nsovereignty, so accomplished, so sweet-natured and so adorned by birth\r\nand lineage. He killed also a few of the Mīrzā's begs and household.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā's birth and descent._)\r\n\r\nHe was born in 882 (1477 AD.), in the Ḥiṣār district. He was Sl. Maḥmūd\r\nMīrzā's second son, younger than Sl. Mas`ud M. and older than Sl. `Alī\r\nM. and Sl. Ḥusain M. and Sl. Wais M. known as Khān Mīrzā. His mother was\r\nPasha Begīm. [Sidenote: Fol. 68b.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. His appearance and characteristics._)\r\n\r\nHe had large eyes, a fleshy face[481] and Turkmān features, was of\r\nmiddle height and altogether an elegant young man (_aet._ 22).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. His qualities and manners._)\r\n\r\nHe was just, humane, pleasant-natured and a most accomplished scion of\r\nsovereignty. His tutor, Sayyid Maḥmūd,[482] presumably was a Shī`a;\r\nthrough this he himself became infected by that heresy. People said that\r\nlatterly, in Samarkand, he reverted from that evil belief to the pure\r\nFaith. He was much addicted to wine but on his non-drinking days, used\r\nto go through the Prayers.[483] He was moderate in gifts and liberality.\r\nHe wrote the _naskh-ta`līq_ character very well; in painting also his\r\nhand was not bad. He made `Ādilī his pen-name and composed good verses\r\nbut not sufficient to form a _dīwān_. Here is the opening couplet\r\n(_maṯla`_) of one of them[484];—\r\n\r\n   Like a wavering shadow I fall here and there;\r\n   If not propped by a wall, I drop flat on the ground.\r\n\r\nIn such repute are his odes held in Samarkand, that they are to be found\r\nin most houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. His battles._)\r\n\r\nHe fought two ranged battles. One, fought when he was first seated on\r\nthe throne (900 AH.-1495 AD.), was with Sl. Maḥmūd Khān[485] who,\r\nincited and stirred up by Sl. Junaid _Barlās_ and others to desire\r\nSamarkand, drew an army out, [Sidenote: Fol. 69.] crossed the Āq-kutal\r\nand went to Rabāṯ-i-soghd and Kān-bāī. Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā went out from\r\nSamarkand, fought him near Kān-bāī, beat him and beheaded 3 or 4000\r\nMughūls. In this fight died Ḥaidar _Kūkūldāsh_, the Khān's looser and\r\nbinder (_ḥall u`aqdī_). His second battle was fought near Bukhārā with\r\nSl. `Alī Mīrzā (901 AH.-1496 AD.); in this he was beaten.[486]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. His countries._)\r\n\r\nHis father, Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā, gave him Bukhārā; when Sl. Maḥmūd M. died,\r\nhis begs assembled and in agreement made Bāī-sunghar M. ruler in\r\nSamarkand. For a time, Bukhārā was included with Samarkand in his\r\njurisdiction but it went out of his hands after the Tarkhān rebellion\r\n(901 AH.-1496 AD.). When he left Samarkand to go to Khusrau Shāh and I\r\ngot possession of it (903 AH.-1497 AD.), Khusrau Shāh took Ḥiṣār and\r\ngave it to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Other details concerning him._)\r\n\r\nHe left no child. He took a daughter of his paternal uncle, Sl. Khalīl\r\nMīrzā, when he went to Khusrau Shāh; he had no other wife or concubine.\r\n\r\nHe never ruled with authority so independent that any beg was heard of\r\nas promoted by him to be his confidant; his begs [Sidenote: Fol. 69b.]\r\nwere just those of his father and his paternal uncle (Aḥmad).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Resumed account of Bābur's campaign against Taṃbal._)\r\n\r\nAfter Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā's death, Sl. Aḥmad _Qarāwal_,[487] the father of\r\nQūch (Qūj) Beg, sent us word (of his intention) and came to us from\r\nḤiṣār through the Qarā-tīgīn country, together with his brethren, elder\r\nand younger, and their families and dependants. From Aūsh too came\r\nQaṃbar-`alī, risen from his sickness. Arriving, as it did, at such a\r\nmoment, we took the providential help of Sl. Aḥmad and his party for a\r\nhappy omen. Next day we formed up at dawn and moved direct upon our foe.\r\nHe made no stand at Āb-i-khān but marched from his ground, leaving many\r\ntents and blankets and things of the baggage for our men. We dismounted\r\nin his camp.\r\n\r\nThat evening Taṃbal, having Jahāngīr with him, turned our left and went\r\nto a village called Khūbān (var. Khūnān), some 3 _yīghāch_ from us (15\r\nm.?) and between us and Andijān. Next day we moved out against him,\r\nformed up with right and left, centre and van, our horses in their mail,\r\nour men in theirs, and with foot-soldiers, bearing mantelets, flung to\r\nthe front. Our right was `Alī-dost and his dependants, our left Ibrāhīm\r\n_Sārū_, Wais _Lāgharī_, Sayyidī Qarā, Muḥammad-`alī _Mubashir_, and\r\nKhwāja-i-kalān's elder brother, Kīchīk Beg, with several of [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 70.] the household. In the left were inscribed[488] also Sl. Aḥmad\r\n_Qarāwal_ and Qūch Beg with their brethren. With me in the centre was\r\nQāsim Beg _Qūchīn_; in the van were Qaṃbar-`alī (the Skinner) and some\r\nof the household. When we reached Sāqā, a village two miles east of\r\nKhūbān, the enemy came out of Khūbān, arrayed to fight. We, for our\r\npart, moved on the faster. At the time of engaging, our foot-soldiers,\r\nprovided how laboriously with the mantelets! were quite in the rear! By\r\nGod's grace, there was no need of them; our left had got hands in with\r\ntheir right before they came up. Kīchīk Beg chopped away very well; next\r\nto him ranked Muḥammad `Alī _Mubashir_. Not being able to bring equal\r\nzeal to oppose us, the enemy took to flight. The fighting did not reach\r\nthe front of our van or right. Our men brought in many of their braves;\r\nwe ordered the heads of all to be struck off. Favouring caution and good\r\ngeneralship, our begs, Qāsim Beg and, especially, `Alī-dost did not\r\nthink it advisable to send far in pursuit; for [Sidenote: Fol. 70b.]\r\nthis reason, many of their men did not fall into our hands. We\r\ndismounted right in Khūbān village. This was my first ranged battle; the\r\nMost High God, of His own favour and mercy, made it a day of victory and\r\ntriumph. We accepted the omen.\r\n\r\nOn the next following day, my father's mother, my grandmother, Shāh\r\nSulṯān Begīm[489] arrived from Andijān, thinking to beg off Jahāngīr\r\nMīrzā if he had been taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Bābur goes into winter-quarters in Between-the-two-rivers._)\r\n\r\nAs it was now almost winter and no grain or fruits[490] remained in the\r\nopen country, it was not thought desirable to move against (Taṃbal in)\r\nAūzkīnt but return was made to Andijān. A few days later, it was settled\r\nafter consultation, that for us to winter in the town would in no way\r\nhurt or hamper the enemy, rather that he would wax the stronger by it\r\nthrough raids and guerilla fighting; moreover on our own account, it was\r\nnecessary that we should winter where our men would not become enfeebled\r\nthrough want of grain and where we could straiten the enemy by some sort\r\nof blockade. For these desirable [Sidenote: Fol. 71.] ends we marched\r\nout of Andijān, meaning to winter near Armiyān and Nūsh-āb in the\r\nRabāṯik-aūrchīnī, known also as Between-the-two-rivers. On arriving in\r\nthe two villages above-mentioned, we prepared winter-quarters.\r\n\r\nThe hunting-grounds are good in that neighbourhood; in the jungle near\r\nthe Aīlāīsh river is much _būghū-marāl_[491] and pig; the small\r\nscattered clumps of jungle are thick with hare and pheasant; and on the\r\nnear rising-ground, are many foxes[492] of fine colour and swifter than\r\nthose of any other place. While we were in those quarters, I used to\r\nride hunting every two or three days; we would beat through the great\r\njungle and hunt _būghū-marāl_, or we would wander about, making a circle\r\nround scattered clumps and flying our hawks at the pheasants. The\r\npheasants are unlimited[493] there; pheasant-meat was abundant as long\r\nas we were in those quarters.\r\n\r\nWhile we were there, Khudāī-bīrdī _Tūghchī_, then newly-favoured with\r\nbeg's rank, fell on some of Taṃbal's raiders and brought in a few heads.\r\nOur braves went out also from Aūsh and Andijān and raided untiringly on\r\nthe enemy, driving in his herds of horses and much enfeebling him. If\r\nthe whole winter had been passed in those quarters, the more probable\r\nthing is [Sidenote: Fol. 71b.] that he would have broken up simply\r\nwithout a fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Qaṃbar-`alī again asks leave._)\r\n\r\nIt was at such a time, just when our foe was growing weak and helpless,\r\nthat Qaṃbar-`alī asked leave to go to his district. The more he was\r\ndissuaded by reminder of the probabilities of the position, the more\r\nstupidity he shewed. An amazingly fickle and veering manikin he was! It\r\nhad to be! Leave for his district was given him. That district had been\r\nKhujand formerly but when Andijān was taken this last time, Asfara and\r\nKand-i-badām were given him in addition. Amongst our begs, he was the\r\none with large districts and many followers; no-one's land or following\r\nequalled his. We had been 40 or 50 days in those winter-quarters. At his\r\nrecommendation, leave was given also to some of the clans in the army.\r\nWe, for our part, went into Andijān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Sl. Maḥmūd Khān sends Mughūls to help Taṃbal._)\r\n\r\nBoth while we were in our winter-quarters and later on in Andijān,\r\nTaṃbal's people came and went unceasingly between him and The Khān in\r\nTāshkīnt. His paternal uncle of the full-blood, Aḥmad Beg, was guardian\r\nof The Khān's son, Sl. Muḥammad Sl. and high in favour; his elder\r\nbrother of the full-blood, Beg Tīlba (Fool), was The Khān's Lord of the\r\nGate. After all the comings and goings, these two brought The Khān to\r\nthe point of reinforcing Taṃbal. Beg Tīlba, leaving his wife and\r\ndomestics and family in Tāshkīnt, came on ahead of the [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n72.] reinforcement and joined his younger brother, Taṃbal,—Beg Tīlba!\r\nwho from his birth up had been in Mughūlistān, had grown up amongst\r\nMughūls, had never entered a cultivated country or served the rulers of\r\none, but from first to last had served The Khāns!\r\n\r\nJust then a wonderful (_`ajab_) thing happened;[494] Qāsim-i-`ajab\r\n(wonderful Qāsim) when he had been left for a time in Akhsī, went out\r\none day after a few marauders, crossed the Khujand-water by Bachrātā,\r\nmet in with a few of Taṃbal's men and was made prisoner.\r\n\r\nWhen Taṃbal heard that our army was disbanded and was assured of The\r\nKhān's help by the arrival of his brother, Beg Tīlba, who had talked\r\nwith The Khān, he rode from Aūzkīnt into Between-the-two-rivers.\r\nMeantime safe news had come to us from Kāsān that The Khān had appointed\r\nhis son, Sl. Muḥ. Khānika, commonly known as Sulṯānīm,[495] and Aḥmad\r\nBeg, with 5 or 6000 men, to help Taṃbal, that they had crossed by the\r\nArcha-kīnt road[496] and were laying siege to Kāsān. Hereupon we,\r\nwithout delay, without a glance at our absent men, just with those there\r\nwere, in the hard cold of winter, put our [Sidenote: Fol. 72b.] trust in\r\nGod and rode off by the Band-i-sālār road to oppose them. That night we\r\nstopped no-where; on we went through the darkness till, at dawn, we\r\ndismounted in Akhsī.[497] So mightily bitter was the cold that night\r\nthat it bit the hands and feet of several men and swelled up the ears of\r\nmany, each ear like an apple. We made no stay in Akhsī but leaving there\r\nYārak T̤aghāī, temporarily also, in Qāsim-i-`ajab's place, passed on for\r\nKāsān. Two miles from Kāsān news came that on hearing of our approach,\r\nAḥmad Beg and Sulṯānīm had hurried off in disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Bābur and Taṃbal again opposed._)\r\n\r\nTaṃbal must have had news of our getting to horse for he had hurried to\r\nhelp his elder brother.[498] Somewhere between the two Prayers of the\r\nday,[499] his blackness[500] became visible towards Nū-kīnt. Astonished\r\nand perplexed by his elder brother's light departure and by our quick\r\narrival, he stopped short. Said we, 'It is God has brought them in this\r\nfashion! here they have come with their horses' necks at full\r\nstretch;[501] if we join hands[502] and go out, and if God bring it\r\nright, not a man of them will get off.' But Wais _Lāgharī_ and some\r\nothers said, 'It is late in the day; even if we do not go out today,\r\nwhere can they go tomorrow? Wherever it is, we will meet [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n73.] them at dawn.' So they said, not thinking it well to make the joint\r\neffort there and then; so too the enemy, come so opportunely, broke up\r\nand got away without any hurt whatever. The (Turkī) proverb is, 'Who\r\ndoes not snatch at a chance, will worry himself about it till old age.'\r\n\r\n   _(Persian) couplet._  Work must be snatched at betimes,\r\n                         Vain is the slacker's mistimed work.\r\n\r\nSeizing the advantage of a respite till the morrow, the enemy slipped\r\naway in the night, and without dismounting on the road, went into Fort\r\nArchīān. When a morrow's move against a foe was made, we found\r\nno foe; after him we went and, not thinking it well to lay close\r\nsiege to Archīān, dismounted two miles off (one _shar`ī_) in\r\nGhazna-namangān.[503] We were in camp there for 30 or 40 days, Taṃbal\r\nbeing in Fort Archīān. Every now and then a very few would go from our\r\nside and come from theirs, fling themselves on one another midway and\r\nreturn. They made one night-attack, rained arrows in on us and retired.\r\nAs the camp was encircled by a ditch or by branches close-set, and as\r\nwatch was kept, they could effect no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. Qaṃbar-`alī, the Skinner, again gives trouble._)\r\n\r\nTwo or three times while we lay in that camp, Qaṃbar-`alī, [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 73b.] in ill-temper, was for going to his district; once he even\r\nhad got to horse and started in a fume, but we sent several begs after\r\nhim who, with much trouble, got him to turn back.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. Further action against Taṃbal and an accommodation made._)\r\n\r\nMeantime Sayyid Yūsuf of Macham had sent a man to Taṃbal and was looking\r\ntowards him. He was the head-man of one of the two foot-hills of\r\nAndijān, Macham and Awīghūr. Latterly he had become known in my Gate,\r\nhaving outgrown the head-man and put on the beg, though no-one ever had\r\nmade him a beg. He was a singularly hypocritical manikin, of no standing\r\nwhatever. From our last taking of Andijān (June 1499) till then (Feb.\r\n1500), he had revolted two or three times from Taṃbal and come to me,\r\nand two or three times had revolted from me and gone to Taṃbal. This was\r\nhis last change of side. With him were many from the (Mughūl) horde and\r\ntribesmen and clansmen. 'Don't let him join Taṃbal,' we said and rode in\r\nbetween them. We got to Bīshkhārān with one night's halt. Taṃbal's men\r\nmust have come earlier and entered the fort. A party of our begs,\r\n`Alī-darwesh Beg and Qūch Beg, with his brothers, went close up to the\r\nGate of [Sidenote: Fol. 74.] Bīshkhārān and exchanged good blows with\r\nthe enemy. Qūch Beg and his brothers did very well there, their hands\r\ngetting in for most of the work. We dismounted on a height some two\r\nmiles from Bīshkhārān; Taṃbal, having Jahāngīr with him, dismounted with\r\nthe fort behind him.\r\n\r\nThree or four days later, begs unfriendly to us, that is to say,\r\n`Alī-dost and Qaṃbar-`alī, the Skinner, with their followers and\r\ndependants, began to interpose with talk of peace. I and my well-wishers\r\nhad no knowledge of a peace and we all[504] were utterly averse from the\r\nproject. Those two manikins however were our two great begs; if we gave\r\nno ear to their words and if we did not make peace, other things from\r\nthem were probable! It had to be! Peace was made in this fashion;—the\r\ndistricts on the Akhsī side of the Khujand-water were to depend on\r\nJahāngīr, those on the Andijān side, on me; Aūzkīnt was to be left in my\r\njurisdiction after they had removed their families from it; when the\r\ndistricts were settled and I and Jahāngīr had made our agreement, we\r\n(_bīz_) should march together against Samarkand; and when I was in\r\npossession of Samarkand, Andijān was to be given to Jahāngīr. So the\r\naffair was settled. [Sidenote: Fol. 74b.] Next day,—it was one of the\r\nlast of Rajab, (end of Feb. 1500) Jahāngīr Mīrzā and Taṃbal came and did\r\nme obeisance; the terms and conditions were ratified as stated above;\r\nleave for Akhsī was given to Jahāngīr and I betook myself to Andijān.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival, Khalīl-of-Taṃbal and our whole band of prisoners were\r\nreleased; robes of honour were put on them and leave to go was given.\r\nThey, in their turn, set free our begs and household, _viz._ the\r\ncommanders[505] (Sherīm?) T̤aghāī Beg, Muḥammad-dost, Mīr Shāh _Qūchīn_,\r\nSayyidī Qarā Beg, Qāsim-i-`ajab, Mīr Wais, Mīrīm _Dīwān_, and those\r\nunder them.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. The self-aggrandizement of `Alī-dost T̤aghāī._)\r\n\r\nAfter our return to Andijān, `Alī-dost's manners and behaviour changed\r\nentirely. He began to live ill with my companions of the guerilla days\r\nand times of hardship. First, he dismissed Khalīfa; next seized and\r\nplundered Ibrāhīm _Sārū_ and Wais _Lāgharī_, and for no fault or cause\r\ndeprived them of their districts and dismissed them. He entangled\r\nhimself with Qāsim Beg and _he_ was made to go; he openly declared,\r\n'Khalīfa and Ibrāhīm are in sympathy about Khwāja-i-qāẓī; they will\r\navenge him on me.'[506] His son, Muḥammad-dost set himself up on a regal\r\nfooting, starting receptions and a public table and a [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n75.] Court and workshops, after the fashion of sulṯāns. Like father,\r\nlike son, they set themselves up in this improper way because they had\r\nTaṃbal at their backs. No authority to restrain their unreasonable\r\nmisdeeds was left to me; for why? Whatever their hearts desired, that\r\nthey did because such a foe of mine as Taṃbal was their backer. The\r\nposition was singularly delicate; not a word was said but many\r\nhumiliations were endured from that father and that son alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_q. Bābur's first marriage._)\r\n\r\n`Āyisha-sulṯān Begīm whom my father and hers, _i.e._ my uncle, Sl. Aḥmad\r\nMīrzā had betrothed to me, came (this year) to Khujand[507] and I took\r\nher in the month of Sha`bān. Though I was not ill-disposed towards her,\r\nyet, this being my first marriage, out of modesty and bashfulness, I\r\nused to see her once in 10, 15 or 20 days. Later on when even my first\r\ninclination did not last, my bashfulness increased. Then my mother\r\nKhānīm used to send me, once a month or every 40 [Sidenote: Fol. 75b.]\r\ndays, with driving and driving, dunnings and worryings.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_r. A personal episode and some verses by Bābur._)\r\n\r\nIn those leisurely days I discovered in myself a strange inclination,\r\nnay! as the verse says, 'I maddened and afflicted myself' for a boy in\r\nthe camp-bazar, his very name, Bāburī, fitting in. Up till then I had\r\nhad no inclination for any-one, indeed of love and desire, either by\r\nhear-say or experience, I had not heard, I had not talked. At that time\r\nI composed Persian couplets, one or two at a time; this is one of the\r\nthem:—\r\n\r\n   May none be as I, humbled and wretched and love-sick;\r\n   No beloved as thou art to me, cruel and careless.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Bāburī used to come to my presence but out of modesty\r\nand bashfulness, I could never look straight at him; how then could I\r\nmake conversation (_ikhtilāṯ_) and recital (_hikāyat_)? In my joy and\r\nagitation I could not thank him (for coming); how was it possible for me\r\nto reproach him with going away? What power had I to command the duty of\r\nservice to myself?[508] One day, during that time of desire and passion\r\nwhen I was going with companions along a lane and suddenly met him face\r\nto face, I got into such a state of confusion that I almost went right\r\noff. To look straight at him [Sidenote: Fol. 76.] or to put words\r\ntogether was impossible. With a hundred torments and shames, I went on.\r\nA (Persian) couplet of Muḥammad Ṣāliḥ's[509] came into my mind:—\r\n\r\n   I am abashed with shame when I see my friend;\r\n   My companions look at me, I look the other way.\r\n\r\nThat couplet suited the case wonderfully well. In that frothing-up of\r\ndesire and passion, and under that stress of youthful folly, I used to\r\nwander, bare-head, bare-foot, through street and lane, orchard and\r\nvineyard. I shewed civility neither to friend nor stranger, took no care\r\nfor myself or others.\r\n\r\n   (_Turkī_) Out of myself desire rushed me, unknowing\r\n             That this is so with the lover of a fairy-face.\r\n\r\nSometimes like the madmen, I used to wander alone over hill and plain;\r\nsometimes I betook myself to gardens and the suburbs, lane by lane. My\r\nwandering was not of my choice, not I decided whether to go or stay.\r\n\r\n   (_Turkī_) Nor power to go was mine, nor power to stay;\r\n             I was just what you made me, o thief of my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_s. Sl. `Alī Mīrzā's quarrels with the Tarkhāns._)\r\n\r\nIn this same year, Sl. `Alī Mīrzā fell out with Muḥammad Mazīd Tarkhān\r\nfor the following reasons;—The Tarkhāns had risen to over-much\r\npredominance and honour; Bāqī had taken the whole revenue of the Bukhārā\r\nGovernment and gave not a [Sidenote: Fol. 76b.] half-penny (_dāng_)[510]\r\nto any-one else; Muḥammad Mazīd, for his part, had control in Samarkand\r\nand took all its districts for his sons and dependants; a small sum only\r\nexcepted, fixed by them, not a farthing (_fils_) from the town reached\r\nthe Mīrzā by any channel. Sl. `Alī Mīrzā was a grown man; how was he to\r\ntolerate such conduct as theirs? He and some of his household formed a\r\ndesign against Muḥ. Mazīd Tarkhān; the latter came to know of it and\r\nleft the town with all his following and with whatever begs and other\r\npersons were in sympathy with him,[511] such as Sl. Ḥusain _Arghūn_, Pīr\r\nAḥmad, Aūzūn Ḥasan's younger brother, Khwāja Ḥusain, Qarā _Barlās_,\r\nṢāliḥ Muḥammad[512] and some other begs and braves.\r\n\r\nAt the time The Khān had joined to Khān Mīrzā a number of Mughūl begs\r\nwith Muḥ. Ḥusain _Dūghlāt_ and Aḥmad Beg, and had appointed them to act\r\nagainst Samarkand.[513] Khān Mīrzā's guardians were Ḥāfiẓ Beg _Dūldāī_\r\nand his son, T̤āhir Beg; because of relationship to them, (Muḥ.\r\nSīghal's) grandson, Ḥasan and Hindū Beg fled with several braves from\r\nSl. `Alī [Sidenote: Fol. 77.] Mīrzā's presence to Khān Mīrzā's.\r\n\r\nMuḥammad Mazīd Tarkhān invited Khān Mīrzā and the Mughūl army, moved to\r\nnear Shavdār, there saw the Mīrzā and met the begs of the Mughūls. No\r\nsmall useful friendlinesses however, came out of the meeting between his\r\nbegs and the Mughūls; the latter indeed seem to have thought of making\r\nhim a prisoner. Of this he and his begs coming to know, separated\r\nthemselves from the Mughūl army. As without him the Mughūls could make\r\nno stand, they retired. Here-upon, Sl. `Alī Mīrzā hurried light out of\r\nSamarkand with a few men and caught them up where they had dismounted in\r\nYār-yīlāq. They could not even fight but were routed and put to flight.\r\nThis deed, done in his last days, was Sl. `Alī Mīrzā's one good little\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nMuḥ. Mazīd Tarkhān and his people, despairing both of the Mughūls and of\r\nthese Mīrzās, sent Mīr Mughūl, son of `Abdu'l-wahhāb _Shaghāwal_[514] to\r\ninvite me (to Samarkand). Mīr Mughūl had already been in my service; he\r\nhad risked his life in good accord with Khwāja-i-qāẓī during the siege\r\nof Andijān (903 AH.-1498 AD.).\r\n\r\nThis business hurt us also[515] and, as it was for that purpose we had\r\nmade peace (with Jahāngīr), we resolved to move on Samarkand. We sent\r\nMīr Mughūl off at once to give rendezvous[516] [Sidenote: Fol. 77b.] to\r\nJahāngīr Mīrzā and prepared to get to horse. We rode out in the month\r\nof Ẕū'l-qa`da (June) and with two halts on the way, came to Qabā and\r\nthere dismounted.[517] At the mid-afternoon Prayer of that day, news\r\ncame that Taṃbal's brother, Khalīl had taken Aūsh by surprise.\r\n\r\nThe particulars are as follows;—As has been mentioned, Khalīl and those\r\nunder him were set free when peace was made. Taṃbal then sent Khalīl to\r\nfetch away their wives and families from Aūzkīnt. He had gone and he\r\nwent into the fort on this pretext. He kept saying untruthfully, 'We\r\nwill go out today,' or 'We will go out tomorrow,' but he did not go.\r\nWhen we got to horse, he seized the chance of the emptiness of Aūsh to\r\ngo by night and surprise it. For several reasons it was of no advantage\r\nfor us to stay and entangle ourselves with him; we went straight on\r\ntherefore. One reason was that as, for the purpose of making ready\r\nmilitary equipment, all my men of name had scattered, heads of houses to\r\ntheir homes, we had no news of them because we had relied on the peace\r\nand were by this off our guard against the treachery and falsity of the\r\nother party. Another reason was that for some time, as has been\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 78.] said, the misconduct of our great begs, `Alī-dost\r\nand Qaṃbar-`alī had been such that no confidence in them was left. A\r\nfurther reason was that the Samarkand begs, under Muḥ. Mazīd Tarkhān had\r\nsent Mīr Mughūl to invite us and, so long as a capital such as Samarkand\r\nstood there, what would incline a man to waste his days for a place like\r\nAndijān?\r\n\r\nFrom Qabā we moved on to Marghīnān (20 m.). Marghīnān had been given to\r\nQūch Beg's father, Sl. Aḥmad _Qarāwal_, and he was then in it. As he,\r\nowing to various ties and attachments, could not attach himself to\r\nme,[518] he stayed behind while his son, Qūch Beg and one or two of his\r\nbrethren, older and younger, went with me.\r\n\r\nTaking the road for Asfara, we dismounted in one of its villages, called\r\nMahan. That night there came and joined us in Mahan, by splendid chance,\r\njust as if to a rendezvous, Qāsim Beg _Qūchīn_ with his company,\r\n`Alī-dost with his, and Sayyid Qāsim with a large body of braves. We\r\nrode from Mahan by the Khasbān (var. Yasān) plain, crossed the Chūpān\r\n(Shepherd)-bridge and so to Aūrā-tīpā.[519]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_t. Qaṃbar-`alī punishes himself._)\r\n\r\nTrusting to Taṃbal, Qaṃbar-`alī went from his own district (Khujand) to\r\nAkhsī in order to discuss army-matters with him. [Sidenote: Fol. 78b.]\r\nSuch an event happening,[520] Taṃbal laid hands on Qaṃbar-`alī, marched\r\nagainst his district and carried him along. Here the (Turkī) proverb\r\nfits, 'Distrust your friend! he'll stuff your hide with straw.' While\r\nQaṃbar-`alī was being made to go to Khujand, he escaped on foot and\r\nafter a hundred difficulties reached Aūrā-tīpā.\r\n\r\nNews came to us there that Shaibānī Khān had beaten Bāqī Tarkhān in\r\nDabūsī and was moving on Bukhārā. We went on from Aūrā-tīpā, by way of\r\nBurka-yīlāq, to Sangzār[521] which the sub-governor surrendered. There\r\nwe placed Qaṃbar-`alī, as, after effecting his own capture and betrayal,\r\nhe had come to us. We then passed on.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_u. Affairs of Samarkand and the end of `Alī-dost._)\r\n\r\nOn our arrival in Khān-yūrtī, the Samarkand begs under Muḥ. Mazīd\r\nTarkhān came and did me obeisance. Conference was held with them as to\r\ndetails for taking the town; they said, 'Khwāja Yaḥya also is wishing\r\nfor the _pādshāh_;[522] with his consent the town may be had easily\r\nwithout fighting or disturbance.' The Khwāja did not say decidedly to\r\nour messengers that he had resolved to admit us to the town but at the\r\nsame time, he said nothing likely to lead us to despair.\r\n\r\nLeaving Khān-yūrtī, we moved to the bank of the Dar-i-gham (canal) and\r\nfrom there sent our librarian, Khwāja Muḥammad [Sidenote: Fol. 79.] `Alī\r\nto Khwāja Yaḥya. He brought word back, 'Let them come; we will give them\r\nthe town.' Accordingly we rode from the Dar-i-gham straight for the\r\ntown, at night-fall, but our plan came to nothing because Sl. Muḥammad\r\n_Dūldāī's_ father, Sl. Maḥmūd had fled from our camp and given such\r\ninformation to (Sl. `Alī's party) as put them on their guard. Back we\r\nwent to the Dar-i-gham bank.\r\n\r\nWhile I had been in Yār-yīlāq, one of my favoured begs, Ibrāhīm _Sārū_\r\nwho had been plundered and driven off by `Alī-dost,[523] came and did me\r\nobeisance, together with Muḥ. Yūsuf, the elder son of Sayyid Yūsuf\r\n(_Aūghlāqchī_). Coming in by ones and twos, old family servants and begs\r\nand some of the household gathered back to me there. All were enemies of\r\n`Alī-dost; some he had driven away; others he had plundered; others\r\nagain he had imprisoned. He became afraid. For why? Because with\r\nTaṃbal's backing, he had harassed and persecuted me and my well-wishers.\r\nAs for me, my very nature sorted ill with the manikin's! From shame and\r\nfear, he could stay no longer with us; he asked leave; I took it as a\r\npersonal favour; I gave it. On this leave, he and his son, Muḥammad-dost\r\nwent to Taṃbal's presence. They became his intimates, [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n79b.] and from father and son alike, much evil and sedition issued.\r\n`Alī-dost died a few years later from ulceration of the hand.\r\nMuḥammad-dost went amongst the Aūzbegs; that was not altogether bad but,\r\nafter some treachery to his salt, he fled from them and went into the\r\nAndijān foot-hills.[524] There he stirred up much revolt and trouble. In\r\nthe end he fell into the hands of Aūzbeg people and they blinded him.\r\nThe meaning of 'The salt took his eyes,' is clear in his case.[525]\r\n\r\nAfter giving this pair their leave, we sent Ghūrī _Barlās_ toward\r\nBukhārā for news. He brought word that Shaibānī Khān had taken Bukhārā\r\nand was on his way to Samarkand. Here-upon, seeing no advantage in\r\nstaying in that neighbourhood, we set out for Kesh where, moreover, were\r\nthe families of most of the Samarkand begs.\r\n\r\nWhen we had been a few weeks there, news came that Sl. `Alī Mīrzā had\r\ngiven Samarkand to Shaibānī Khān. The particulars are these;—The Mīrzā's\r\nmother, Zuhra Begī Āghā (_Aūzbeg_), in her ignorance and folly, had\r\nsecretly written to [Sidenote: Fol. 80.] Shaibānī Khān that if he would\r\ntake her (to wife) her son should give him Samarkand and that when\r\nShaibānī had taken (her son's) father's country, he should give her son\r\na country.[526] Sayyid Yūsuf _Arghūn_ must have known of this plan,\r\nindeed will have been the traitor inventing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n906 AH.—JULY 28TH. 1500 TO JULY 17TH. 1501 AD.[527]\r\n\r\n(_a. Samarkand in the hands of the Aūzbegs._)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, acting on that woman's promise, Shaibānī Khān went to Samarkand,\r\nhe dismounted in the Garden of the Plain. About mid-day Sl. `Alī Mīrzā\r\nwent out to him through the Four-roads Gate, without a word to any of\r\nhis begs or unmailed braves, without taking counsel with any-one soever\r\nand accompanied only by a few men of little consideration from his own\r\nclose circle. The Khān, for his part, did not receive him very\r\nfavourably; when they had seen one another, he seated him on his less\r\nhonourable hand.[528] Khwāja Yaḥya, on hearing of the Mīrzā's departure,\r\nbecame very anxious but as he could find no remedy,[529] went out also.\r\nThe Khān looked at him without rising and said a few words in which\r\nblame had part, but when the Khwāja rose to leave, showed him the\r\nrespect of rising.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Khwāja `Alī[530] Bāy's[531] son, Jān-`alī heard in\r\nRabāṯ-i-khwāja of the Mīrzā's going to Shaibānī Khān, he also went. As\r\nfor that calamitous woman who, in her folly, gave her son's [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 80b.] house and possessions to the winds in order to get herself a\r\nhusband, Shaibānī Khān cared not one atom for her, indeed did not regard\r\nher as the equal of a mistress or a concubine.[532]\r\n\r\nConfounded by his own act, Sl. `Alī Mīrzā's repentance was extreme. Some\r\nof his close circle, after hearing particulars, planned for him to\r\nescape with them but to this he would not agree; his hour had come; he\r\nwas not to be freed. He had dismounted in Tīmūr Sulṯān's quarters; three\r\nor four days later they killed him in Plough-meadow.[533] For a matter\r\nof this five-days' mortal life, he died with a bad name; having entered\r\ninto a woman's affairs, he withdrew himself from the circle of men of\r\ngood repute. Of such people's doings no more should be written; of acts\r\nso shameful, no more should be heard.\r\n\r\nThe Mīrzā having been killed, Shaibānī Khān sent Jān-`alī after his\r\nMīrzā. He had apprehensions also about Khwāja Yaḥya and therefore\r\ndismissed him, with his two sons, Khwāja Muḥ. Zakarīya and Khwāja Bāqī,\r\ntowards Khurāsān.[534] A few Aūzbegs followed them and near Khwāja\r\nKārdzan martyred both the Khwāja and his two young sons. Though\r\nShaibānī's [Sidenote: Fol. 81.] words were, 'Not through me the Khwāja's\r\naffair! Qaṃbar Bī and Kūpuk Bī did it,' this is worse than that! There\r\nis a proverb,[535] 'His excuse is worse than his fault,' for if begs,\r\nout of their own heads, start such deeds, unknown to their Khāns or\r\nPādshāhs, what becomes of the authority of khānship and sovereignty?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Bābur leaves Kesh and crosses the Mūra pass._)\r\n\r\nSince the Aūzbegs were in possession of Samarkand, we left Kesh and went\r\nin the direction of Ḥiṣār. With us started off Muḥ. Mazīd Tārkhān and\r\nthe Samarkand begs under his command, together with their wives and\r\nfamilies and people, but when we dismounted in the Chultū meadow of\r\nChaghānīān, they parted from us, went to Khusrau Shāh and became his\r\nretainers.\r\n\r\nCut off from our own abiding-town and country,[536] not knowing where\r\n(else) to go or where to stay, we were obliged to traverse the very\r\nheart of Khusrau Shāh's districts, spite of what measure of misery he\r\nhad inflicted on the men of our dynasty!\r\n\r\nOne of our plans had been to go to my younger Khān dādā, _i.e._ Alacha\r\nKhān, by way of Qarā-tīgīn and the Alāī,[537] but this was not managed.\r\nNext we were for going up the valley of the Kām torrent and over the\r\nSara-tāq pass (_dābān_). When we were near Nūnḍāk, a servant of Khusrau\r\nShāh brought me one set of nine horses[538] and one of nine pieces of\r\ncloth. When we dismounted at the mouth of the Kām valley, Sher-`alī.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 81b.] the page, deserted to Khusrau Shāh's brother, Walī\r\nand, next day, Qūch Beg parted from us and went to Ḥiṣār.[539]\r\n\r\nWe entered the valley and made our way up it. On its steep and narrow\r\nroads and at its sharp and precipitous saddles[540] many horses and\r\ncamels were left. Before we reached the Sara-tāq pass we had (in 25 m.)\r\nto make three or four night-halts. A pass! and what a pass! Never was\r\nsuch a steep and narrow pass seen; never were traversed such ravines and\r\nprecipices. Those dangerous narrows and sudden falls, those perilous\r\nheights and knife-edge saddles, we got through with much difficulty and\r\nsuffering, with countless hardships and miseries. Amongst the Fān\r\nmountains is a large lake (Iskandar); it is 2 miles in circumference, a\r\nbeautiful lake and not devoid of marvels.[541]\r\n\r\nNews came that Ibrāhīm Tarkhān had strengthened Fort Shīrāz and was\r\nseated in it; also that Qaṃbar-`alī (the Skinner) and Abū'l-qāsim\r\n_Kohbur_, the latter not being able to stay in Khwāja Dīdār with the\r\nAūzbegs in Samarkand,—had both come into Yār-yīlāq, strengthened its\r\nlower forts and occupied them.\r\n\r\nLeaving Fān on our right, we moved on for Keshtūd. The head-man of Fān\r\nhad a reputation for hospitality, generosity, [Sidenote: Fol. 82.]\r\nserviceableness and kindness. He had given tribute of 70 or 80 horses to\r\nSl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā at the time the Mīrzā, when Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā made\r\nattack on Ḥiṣār, went through Fān on his way to his younger brother,\r\nBāī-sunghar Mīrzā in Samarkand. He did like service to others. To me he\r\nsent one second-rate horse; moreover he did not wait on me himself. So\r\nit was! Those renowned for liberality became misers when they had to do\r\nwith me, and the politeness of the polite was forgotten. Khusrau Shāh\r\nwas celebrated for liberality and kindness; what service he did\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā has been mentioned; to Bāqī Tarkhān and other begs\r\nhe shewed great generosity also. Twice I happened to pass through his\r\ncountry;[542] not to speak of courtesy shewn to my peers, what he shewed\r\nto my lowest servants he did not shew to me, indeed he shewed less\r\nregard for us than for them.\r\n\r\n   (_Turkī_) Who, o my heart! has seen goodness from worldlings?\r\n             Look not for goodness from him who has none.\r\n\r\nUnder the impression that the Aūzbegs were in Keshtūd, we made an\r\nexcursion to it, after passing Fān. Of itself it seemed [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n82b.] to have gone to ruin; no-one seemed to be occupying it. We went on\r\nto the bank of the Kohik-water (Zar-afshān) and there dismounted. From\r\nthat place we sent a few begs under Qāsim _Qūchīn_ to surprise\r\nRabāṯ-i-khwāja; that done, we crossed the river by a bridge from\r\nopposite Yārī, went through Yārī and over the Shunqār-khāna\r\n(Falcons'-home) range into Yār-yīlāq. Our begs went to Rabāṯ-i-khwāja\r\nand had set up ladders when the men within came to know about them and\r\nforced them to retire. As they could not take the fort, they rejoined\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Bābur renews attack on Samarkand._)\r\n\r\nQaṃbar-`alī (the Skinner) was (still) holding Sangzār; he came and saw\r\nus; Abū'l-qāsim _Kohbur_ and Ibrāhīm Tarkhān showed loyalty and\r\nattachment by sending efficient men for our service. We went into\r\nAsfīdik (var. Asfīndik), one of the Yār-yīlāq villages. At that time\r\nShaibāq Khān lay near Khwāja Dīdār with 3 or 4000 Aūzbegs and as many\r\nmore soldiers gathered in locally. He had given the Government of\r\nSamarkand to Jān-wafā, and Jān-wafā was then in the fort with 500 or 600\r\nmen. Ḥamza Sl. and Mahdī Sl. were lying near the fort, in the\r\nQuail-reserve. Our men, good and bad were 240. [Sidenote: Fol. 83.]\r\n\r\nHaving discussed the position with all my begs and unmailed braves, we\r\nleft it at this;—that as Shaibānī Khān had taken possession of Samarkand\r\nso recently, the Samarkandīs would not be attached to him nor he to\r\nthem; that if we made an effort at once, we might do the thing; that if\r\nwe set ladders up and took the fort by surprise, the Samarkandīs would\r\nbe for us; how should they not be? even if they gave us no help, they\r\nwould not fight us for the Aūzbegs; and that Samarkand once in our\r\nhands, whatever was God's will, would happen.\r\n\r\nActing on this decision, we rode out of Yār-yīlāq after the Mid-day\r\nPrayer, and on through the dark till mid-night when we reached\r\nKhān-yūrtī. Here we had word that the Samarkandīs knew of our coming;\r\nfor this reason we went no nearer to the town but made straight back\r\nfrom Khān-yūrtī. It was dawn when, after crossing the Kohik-water below\r\nRabāṯ-i-khwāja, we were once more in Yār-yīlāq.\r\n\r\nOne day in Fort Asfīdik a household party was sitting in my presence;\r\nDost-i-nāṣir and Nuyān[543] _Kūkūldāsh_ and Khān-qulī-i-Karīm-dād and\r\nShaikh Darwesh and Mīrīm-i-nāṣir were all there. Words were crossing\r\nfrom all sides when (I said), 'Come now! say when, if God bring it\r\nright, we shall take [Sidenote: Fol. 83b.] Samarkand.' Some said, 'We\r\nshall take it in the heats.' It was then late in autumn. Others said,\r\n'In a month,' 'Forty days,' 'Twenty days.' Nuyān _Kūkūldāsh_ said, 'We\r\nshall take it in 14.' God shewed him right! we did take it in exactly 14\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nJust at that time I had a wonderful dream;—His Highness Khwāja\r\n`Ubaid'l-lāh (_Aḥrārī_) seemed to come; I seemed to go out to give him\r\nhonourable meeting; he came in and seated himself; people seemed to lay\r\na table-cloth before him, apparently without sufficient care and, on\r\naccount of this, something seemed to come into his Highness Khwāja's\r\nmind. Mullā Bābā (? _Pashāgharī_) made me a sign; I signed back, 'Not\r\nthrough me! the table-layer is in fault!' The Khwāja understood and\r\naccepted the excuse.[544] When he rose, I escorted him out. In the hall\r\nof that house he took hold of either my right or left arm and lifted me\r\nup till one of my feet was off the ground, saying, in Turkī, 'Shaikh\r\nMaṣlaḥat has given (Samarkand).'[545] I really took Samarkand a few days\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Bābur takes Samarkand by surprise._)\r\n\r\nIn two or three days move was made from Fort Asfīdik to Fort Wasmand.\r\nAlthough by our first approach, we had let [Sidenote: Fol. 84.] our plan\r\nbe known, we put our trust in God and made another expedition to\r\nSamarkand. It was after the Mid-day Prayer that we rode out of Fort\r\nWasmand, Khwāja Abū'l-makāram accompanying us. By mid-night we reached\r\nthe Deep-fosse-bridge in the Avenue. From there we sent forward a\r\ndetachment of 70 or 80 good men who were to set up ladders opposite the\r\nLovers'-cave, mount them and get inside, stand up to those in the\r\nTurquoise Gate, get possession of it and send a man to me. Those braves\r\nwent, set their ladders up opposite the Lovers'-cave, got in without\r\nmaking anyone aware, went to the Gate, attacked Fāẓil Tarkhān, chopped\r\nat him and his few retainers, killed them, broke the lock with an axe\r\nand opened the Gate. At that moment I came up and went in.\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on Fāẓil Tarkhān._) He was not one of those\r\n   (Samarkand) Tarkhāns; he was a merchant-tarkhān of Turkistān.\r\n   He had served Shaibānī Khān in Turkistān and had found favour\r\n   with him.[546]\r\n\r\nAbū'l-qāsim _Kohbur_ himself had not come with us but had sent 30 or 40\r\nof his retainers under his younger brother, Aḥmad-i-qāsim. No man of\r\nIbrāhīm Tarkhān's was with us; his younger brother, Aḥmad Tarkhān came\r\nwith a few retainers after I had entered the town and taken post in the\r\nMonastery. [Sidenote: Fol. 84b.]\r\n\r\nThe towns-people were still slumbering; a few traders peeped out of\r\ntheir shops, recognized me and put up prayers. When, a little later, the\r\nnews spread through the town, there was rare delight and satisfaction\r\nfor our men and the towns-folk. They killed the Aūzbegs in the lanes and\r\ngullies with clubs and stones like mad dogs; four or five hundred were\r\nkilled in this fashion. Jān-wafā, the then governor, was living in\r\nKhwāja Yaḥya's house; he fled and got away to Shaibāq Khān.[547]\r\n\r\nOn entering the Turquoise Gate I went straight to the College and took\r\npost over the arch of the Monastery. There was a hubbub and shouting of\r\n'Down! down!' till day-break. Some of the notables and traders, hearing\r\nwhat was happening, came joyfully to see me, bringing what food was\r\nready and putting up prayers for me. At day-light we had news that the\r\nAūzbegs were fighting in the Iron Gate where they had made themselves\r\nfast between the (outer and inner) doors. With 10, 15 or 20 men, I at\r\nonce set off for the Gate but before I came up, the town-rabble, busy\r\nransacking every corner of the newly-taken town for loot, had driven the\r\nAūzbegs out through [Sidenote: Fol. 85.] it. Shaibāq Khān, on hearing\r\nwhat was happening, hurried at sun-rise to the Iron Gate with 100 or 140\r\nmen. His coming was a wonderful chance but, as has been said, my men\r\nwere very few. Seeing that he could do nothing, he rode off at once.\r\nFrom the Iron Gate I went to the citadel and there dismounted, at the\r\nBū-stān palace. Men of rank and consequence and various head-men came to\r\nme there, saw me and invoked blessings on me.\r\n\r\nSamarkand for nearly 140 years had been the capital of our dynasty. An\r\nalien, and of what stamp! an Aūzbeg foe, had taken possession of it! It\r\nhad slipped from our hands; God gave it again! plundered and ravaged,\r\nour own returned to us.\r\n\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā took Harāt[548] as we took Samarkand, by surprise, but\r\nto the experienced, and discerning, and just, it will be clear that\r\nbetween his affair and mine there are distinctions and differences, and\r\nthat his capture and mine are things apart.\r\n\r\nFirstly there is this;—He had ruled many years, passed through much\r\nexperience and seen many affairs.\r\n\r\nSecondly;—He had for opponent, Yādgār Muḥ. Nāṣir Mīrzā, [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n85b.] an inexperienced boy of 17 or 18.\r\n\r\nThirdly;—(Yādgār Mīrzā's) Head-equerry, Mīr `Alī, a person\r\nwell-acquainted with the particulars of the whole position, sent a man\r\nout from amongst Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's opponents to bring him to surprise\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFourthly;—His opponent was not in the fort but was in the\r\nRavens'-garden. Moreover Yādgār Muḥ. Nāṣir Mīrzā and his followers are\r\nsaid to have been so prostrate with drink that three men only were in\r\nthe Gate, they also drunk.\r\n\r\nFifthly;—he surprised and captured Harāt the first time he approached\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand: firstly;—I was 19 when I took Samarkand.\r\n\r\nSecondly;—I had as my opponent, such a man as Shaibāq Khān, of mature\r\nage and an eye-witness of many affairs.\r\n\r\nThirdly;—No-one came out of Samarkand to me; though the heart of its\r\npeople was towards me, no-one could dream of coming, from dread of\r\nShaibāq Khān.\r\n\r\nFourthly;—My foe was in the fort; not only was the fort taken but he was\r\ndriven off.\r\n\r\nFifthly;—I had come once already; my opponent was on his guard about me.\r\nThe second time we came, God brought it right! Samarkand was won.\r\n\r\nIn saying these things there is no desire to be-little the reputation of\r\nany man; the facts were as here stated. In [Sidenote: Fol. 86.] writing\r\nthese things, there is no desire to magnify myself; the truth is set\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe poets composed chronograms on the victory; this one remains in my\r\nmemory;—Wisdom answered, 'Know that its date is the _Victory_ (_Fatḥ_)\r\n_of Bābur Bahādur_.'\r\n\r\nSamarkand being taken, Shavdār and Soghd and the _tūmāns_ and nearer\r\nforts began, one after another, to return to us. From some their Aūzbeg\r\ncommandants fled in fear and escaped; from others the inhabitants drove\r\nthem and came in to us; in some they made them prisoner, and held the\r\nforts for us.\r\n\r\nJust then the wives and families of Shaibāq Khān and his Aūzbegs arrived\r\nfrom Turkistān;[549] he was lying near Khwāja Dīdār and `Alī-ābād but\r\nwhen he saw the forts and people returning to me, marched off towards\r\nBukhārā. By God's grace, all the forts of Soghd and Miyān-kāl returned\r\nto me within three or four months. Over and above this, Bāqī Tarkhān\r\nseized this opportunity to occupy Qarshī; Khuzār and Qarshī (? Kesh)\r\nboth went out of Aūzbeg hands; Qarā-kūl [Sidenote: Fol. 86b.] also was\r\ntaken from them by people of Abū'l-muḥsin Mīrzā (_Bāī-qarā_), coming up\r\nfrom Merv. My affairs were in a very good way.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Birth of Bābur's first child._)\r\n\r\nAfter our departure (last year) from Andijān, my mothers and my wife and\r\nrelations came, with a hundred difficulties and hardships, to Aūrātīpā.\r\nWe now sent for them to Samarkand. Within a few days after their\r\narrival, a daughter was born to me by `Āyisha-sulṯān Begīm, my first\r\nwife, the daughter of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā. They named the child\r\nFakhru'n-nisā' (Ornament of women); she was my first-born, I was 19. In\r\na month or 40 days, she went to God's mercy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Bābur in Samarkand._)\r\n\r\nOn taking Samarkand, envoys and summoners were sent off at once, and\r\nsent again and again, with reiterated request for aid and reinforcement,\r\nto the khāns and sulṯāns and begs and marchers on every side. Some,\r\nthough experienced men, made foolish refusal; others whose relations\r\ntowards our family had been discourteous and unpleasant, were afraid for\r\nthemselves and took no notice; others again, though they sent help, sent\r\nit insufficient. Each such case will be duly mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhen Samarkand was taken the second time, `Alī-sher Beg [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n87.] was alive. We exchanged letters once; on the back of mine to him I\r\nwrote one of my Turkī couplets. Before his reply reached me, separations\r\n(_tafarqa_) and disturbances (_ghūghā_) had happened.[550] Mullā Binā'ī\r\nhad been taken into Shaibāq Khān's service when the latter took\r\npossession of Samarkand; he stayed with him until a few days after I\r\ntook the place, when he came into the town to me. Qāsim Beg had his\r\nsuspicions about him and consequently dismissed him towards Shahr-i-sabz\r\nbut, as he was a man of parts, and as no fault of his came to light, I\r\nhad him fetched back. He constantly presented me with odes (_qaṣīda u\r\nghazal_). He brought me a song in the Nawā mode composed to my name and\r\nat the same time the following quatrain;—[551]\r\n\r\n   No grain (_ghala_) have I by which I can be fed (_noshīd_);\r\n   No rhyme of grain (_mallah_, nankeen) wherewith I can be\r\n     clad (_poshīd_);\r\n   The man who lacks both food and clothes,\r\n   In art or science where can he compete (_koshīd_)?\r\n\r\nIn those days of respite, I had written one or two couplets but had not\r\ncompleted an ode. As an answer to Mullā Binā'ī I made up and set this\r\npoor little Turkī quatrain;—[552]\r\n\r\n   As is the wish of your heart, so shall it be (_būlghūsīdūr_);\r\n   For gift and stipend both an order shall be made (_buyurūlghūsīdūr_);\r\n   I know the grain and its rhyme you write of;\r\n   The garments, you, your house, the corn shall fill (_tūlghūsīdūr_).\r\n\r\nThe Mullā in return wrote and presented a quatrain to me in [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 87b.] which for his refrain, he took a rhyme to (the _tūlghūsīdūr_\r\nof) my last line and chose another rhyme;—\r\n\r\n   Mīrzā-of-mine, the Lord of sea and land shall be (_yīr būlghūsīdūr_);\r\n   His art and skill, world o'er, the evening tale shall be\r\n     (_samar būlghūsīdūr_);\r\n   If gifts like these reward one rhyming (_or_ pointless) word;\r\n   For words of sense, what guerdon will there be (_nilār būlghūsīdūr_)?\r\n\r\nAbū'l-barka, known as _Farāqi_ (Parted), who just then had come to\r\nSamarkand from Shahr-i-sabz, said Binā'ī ought to have rhymed. He made\r\nthis verse;—\r\n\r\n   Into Time's wrong to you quest shall be made (_sūrūlghūsīdūr_);\r\n   Your wish the Sulṯān's grace from Time shall ask (_qūlghūsīdūr_);\r\n   O Ganymede! our cups, ne'er filled as yet,\r\n   In this new Age, brimmed-up, filled full shall be (_tūlghūsīdūr_).\r\n\r\nThough this winter our affairs were in a very good way and Shaibāq\r\nKhān's were on the wane, one or two occurrences were somewhat of a\r\ndisservice; (1) the Merv men who had taken Qarā-kūl, could not be\r\npersuaded to stay there and it went back into the hands of the Aūzbegs;\r\n(2) Shaibāq Khān besieged Ibrāhīm Tarkhān's younger brother, Aḥmad in\r\nDabūsī, stormed the place and made a general massacre of its inhabitants\r\nbefore the army we were collecting was ready to march.\r\n\r\nWith 240 proved men I had taken Samarkand; in the next [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n88.] five or six months, things so fell out by the favour of the Most\r\nHigh God, that, as will be told, we fought the arrayed battle of\r\nSar-i-pul with a man like Shaibāq Khān. The help those round-about gave\r\nus was as follows;—From The Khān had come, with 4 or 5000 Bārīns, Ayūb\r\n_Begchīk_ and Qashka Maḥmūd; from Jahāngīr Mīrzā had come Khalīl,\r\nTaṃbal's younger brother, with 100 or 200 men; not a man had come from\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, that experienced ruler, than whom none knew better the\r\ndeeds and dealings of Shaibāq Khān; none came from Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā;\r\nnone from Khusrau Shāh because he, the author of what evil done,—as has\r\nbeen told,—to our dynasty! feared us more than he feared Shaibāq Khān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Bābur defeated at Sar-i-pul._)\r\n\r\nI marched out of Samarkand, with the wish of fighting Shaibāq Khān, in\r\nthe month of Shawwāl[553] and went to the New-garden where we lay four\r\nor five days for the convenience of gathering our men and completing our\r\nequipment. We took the precaution of fortifying our camp with ditch and\r\nbranch. From the New-garden we advanced, march by march, to beyond\r\nSar-i-pul (Bridge-head) and there dismounted. [Sidenote: Fol. 88b.]\r\nShaibāq Khān came from the opposite direction and dismounted at Khwāja\r\nKārdzan, perhaps one _yīghāch_ away (? 5 m.). We lay there for four or\r\nfive days. Every day our people went from our side and his came from\r\ntheirs and fell on one another. One day when they were in unusual force,\r\nthere was much fighting but neither side had the advantage. Out of that\r\nengagement one of our men went rather hastily back into the\r\nentrenchments; he was using a standard; some said it was Sayyidī Qarā\r\nBeg's standard who really was a man of strong words but weak sword.\r\nShaibāq Khān made one night-attack on us but could do nothing because\r\nthe camp was protected by ditch and close-set branches. His men raised\r\ntheir war-cry, rained in arrows from outside the ditch and then retired.\r\n\r\nIn the work for the coming battle I exerted myself greatly and took all\r\nprecautions; Qaṃbar-`alī also did much. In Kesh lay Bāqī Tarkhān with\r\n1000 to 2000 men, in a position to join us after a couple of days. In\r\nDiyūl, 4 _yīghāch_ off (? 20 m.), lay Sayyid Muḥ. Mīrzā _Dūghlāt_,\r\nbringing me 1000 to 2000 men from my Khān dādā; he would have joined me\r\nat [Sidenote: Fol. 89.] dawn. With matters in this position, we hurried\r\non the fight!\r\n\r\n   Who lays with haste his hand on the sword,\r\n   Shall lift to his teeth the back-hand of regret.[554]\r\n\r\nThe reason I was so eager to engage was that on the day of battle, the\r\nEight stars[555] were between the two armies; they would have been in\r\nthe enemy's rear for 13 or 14 days if the fight had been deferred. I now\r\nunderstand that these considerations are worth nothing and that our\r\nhaste was without reason.\r\n\r\nAs we wished to fight, we marched from our camp at dawn, we in our mail,\r\nour horses in theirs, formed up in array of right and left, centre and\r\nvan. Our right was Ibrāhīm _Sārū_, Ibrāhīm Jānī, Abū'l-qāsim _Kohbur_\r\nand other begs. Our left was Muḥ. Mazīd Tarkhān, Ibrāhīm Tarkhān and\r\nother Samarkandī begs, also Sl. Ḥusain _Arghūn_, Qarā (Black) _Barlās_,\r\nPīr Aḥmad and Khwāja Ḥusain. Qāsim Beg was (with me) in the centre and\r\nalso several of my close circle and household. In the van were inscribed\r\nQaṃbar-`alī the Skinner, Banda-`alī, Khwāja `Alī, Mīr Shāh _Qūchīn_,\r\nSayyid Qāsim, Lord of the Gate,—Banda-`alī's younger brother Khaldar\r\n(mole-marked) and Ḥaidar-i-qāsim's son Qūch, together with all the good\r\nbraves there were, and the rest of the household.\r\n\r\nThus arrayed, we marched from our camp; the enemy, also in array,\r\nmarched out from his. His right was Maḥmūd and Jānī and Tīmūr Sulṯāns;\r\nhis left, Ḥamza and Mahdī and some [Sidenote: Fol. 89b.] other sulṯāns.\r\nWhen our two armies approached one another, he wheeled his right towards\r\nour rear. To meet this, I turned; this left our van,—in which had been\r\ninscribed what not of our best braves and tried swordsmen!—to our right\r\nand bared our front (_i.e._ the front of the centre). None-the-less we\r\nfought those who made the front-attack on us, turned them and forced\r\nthem back on their own centre. So far did we carry it that some of\r\nShaibāq Khān's old chiefs said to him, 'We must move off! It is past a\r\nstand.' He however held fast. His right beat our left, then wheeled\r\n(again) to our rear.\r\n\r\n(As has been said), the front of our centre was bare through our van's\r\nbeing left to the right. The enemy attacked us front and rear, raining\r\nin arrows on us. (Ayūb _Begchīk's_) Mughūl army, come for our help! was\r\nof no use in fighting; it set to work forthwith to unhorse and plunder\r\nour men. Not this [Sidenote: Fol. 90.] once only! This is always the way\r\nwith those ill-omened Mughūls! If they win, they grab at booty; if they\r\nlose, they unhorse and pilfer their own side! We drove back the Aūzbegs\r\nwho attacked our front by several vigorous assaults, but those who had\r\nwheeled to our rear came up and rained arrows on our standard. Falling\r\non us in this way, from the front and from the rear, they made our men\r\nhurry off.\r\n\r\nThis same turning-movement is one of the great merits of Aūzbeg\r\nfighting; no battle of theirs is ever without it. Another merit of\r\ntheirs is that they all, begs and retainers, from their front to their\r\nrear, ride, loose-rein at the gallop, shouting as they come and, in\r\nretiring, do not scatter but ride off, at the gallop, in a body.\r\n\r\nTen or fifteen men were left with me. The Kohik-water was close by,—the\r\npoint of our right had rested on it. We made straight for it. It was the\r\nseason when it comes down in flood. We rode right into it, man and horse\r\nin mail. It was just fordable for half-way over; after that it had to be\r\nswum. For more than an arrow's flight[556] we, man and mount in mail!\r\nmade our horses swim and so got across. Once out of the water, we cut\r\noff the horse-armour and let it lie. By thus [Sidenote: Fol. 90b.]\r\npassing to the north bank of the river, we were free of our foes, but at\r\nonce Mughūl wretches were the captors and pillagers of one after another\r\nof my friends. Ibrāhīm Tarkhān and some others, excellent braves all,\r\nwere unhorsed and killed by Mughūls.[557] We moved along the north bank\r\nof the Kohik-river, recrossed it near Qulba, entered the town by the\r\nShaikh-zāda's Gate and reached the citadel in the middle of the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nBegs of our greatest, braves of our best and many men perished in that\r\nfight. There died Ibrāhīm Tarkhān, Ibrāhīm _Sārū_ and Ibrāhīm Jānī;\r\noddly enough three great begs named Ibrāhīm perished. There died also\r\nḤaidar-i-qāsim's eldest son, Abū'l-qāsim _Kohbur_, and Khudāī-bīrdī\r\n_Tūghchī_ and Khalīl, Taṃbal's younger brother, spoken of already\r\nseveral times. Many of our men fled in different directions;\r\nMuḥ. Mazīd Tarkhān went towards Qūndūz and Ḥiṣār for Khusrau Shāh.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 91.] Some of the household and of the braves, such as\r\nKarīm-dad-i-Khudāī-bīrdī _Turkmān_ and Jānaka _Kūkūldāsh_ and Mullā Bābā\r\nof Pashāghar got away to Aūrā-tīpā. Mullā Bābā at that time was not in\r\nmy service but had gone out with me in a guest's fashion. Others again,\r\ndid what Sherīm T̤aghāī and his band did;—though he had come back with\r\nme into the town and though when consultation was had, he had agreed\r\nwith the rest to make the fort fast, looking for life or death within\r\nit, yet spite of this, and although my mothers and sisters, elder and\r\nyounger, stayed on in Samarkand, he sent off their wives and families to\r\nAūrā-tīpā and remained himself with just a few men, all unencumbered.\r\nNot this once only! Whenever hard work had to be done, low and\r\ndouble-minded action was the thing to expect from him!\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Bābur besieged in Samarkand._)\r\n\r\nNext day, I summoned Khwāja Abū'l-makāram, Qāsim and the other begs, the\r\nhousehold and such of the braves as were admitted to our counsels, when\r\nafter consultation, we resolved to make the fort fast and to look for\r\nlife or death within it. I and Qāsim Beg with my close circle and\r\nhousehold were the reserve. For convenience in this I took up quarters\r\nin the middle of the town, in tents pitched on the roof of Aūlūgh Beg\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 91b.] Mīrzā's College. To other begs and braves posts\r\nwere assigned in the Gates or on the ramparts of the walled-town.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days later, Shaibāq Khān dismounted at some distance from\r\nthe fort. On this, the town-rabble came out of lanes and wards, in\r\ncrowds, to the College gate, shouted good wishes for me and went out to\r\nfight in mob-fashion. Shaibāq Khān had got to horse but could not so\r\nmuch as approach the town. Several days went by in this fashion. The mob\r\nand rabble, knowing nothing of sword and arrow-wounds, never witnesses\r\nof the press and carnage of a stricken field, through these incidents,\r\nbecame bold and began to sally further and further out. If warned by the\r\nbraves against going out so incautiously, they broke into reproach.\r\n\r\nOne day when Shaibāq Khān had directed his attack towards the Iron Gate,\r\nthe mob, grown bold, went out, as usual, daringly and far. To cover\r\ntheir retreat, we sent several braves towards the Camel's-neck,[558]\r\nfoster-brethren and some of the close household-circle, such as Nuyān\r\n_Kūkūldāsh_, Qul-naẕar (son of Sherīm?) T̤aghāī Beg, and Mazīd. An\r\nAūzbeg or two [Sidenote: Fol. 92.] put their horses at them and with\r\nQul-naẕar swords were crossed. The rest of the Aūzbegs dismounted and\r\nbrought their strength to bear on the rabble, hustled them off and\r\nrammed them in through the Iron Gate. Qūch Beg and Mīr Shāh _Qūchīn_ had\r\ndismounted at the side of Khwāja Khiẓr's Mosque and were making a stand\r\nthere. While the townsmen were being moved off by those on foot, a party\r\nof mounted Aūzbegs rode towards the Mosque. Qūch Beg came out when they\r\ndrew near and exchanged good blows with them. He did distinguished work;\r\nall stood to watch. Our fugitives below were occupied only with their\r\nown escape; for them the time to shoot arrows and make a stand had gone\r\nby. I was shooting with a slur-bow[559] from above the Gate and some of\r\nmy circle were shooting arrows (_aūq_). Our attack from above kept the\r\nenemy from advancing beyond the Mosque; from there he retired.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege, the round of the ramparts was made each night;\r\nsometimes I went, sometimes Qāsim Beg, sometimes one of the household\r\nBegs. Though from the Turquoise to the Shaikh-zāda's Gate may be ridden,\r\nthe rest of the way must be [Sidenote: Fol. 92b.] walked. When some men\r\nwent the whole round on foot, it was dawn before they had finished.[560]\r\n\r\nOne day Shaibāq Khān attacked between the Iron Gate and the\r\nShaikh-zāda's. I, as the reserve, went to the spot, without anxiety\r\nabout the Bleaching-ground and Needle-makers' Gates. That day, (?) in a\r\nshooting wager (_aūq aūchīdā_), I made a good shot with a slur-bow, at a\r\nCenturion's horse.[561] It died at once (_aūq bārdī_) with the arrow\r\n(_aūq bīla_). They made such a vigorous attack this time that they got\r\nclose under the ramparts. Busy with the fighting and the stress near the\r\nIron Gate, we were entirely off our guard about the other side of the\r\ntown. There, opposite the space between the Needle-makers' and\r\nBleaching-ground Gates, the enemy had posted 7 or 800 good men in\r\nambush, having with them 24 or 25 ladders so wide that two or three\r\ncould mount abreast. These men came from their ambush when the attack\r\nnear the Iron Gate, by occupying all our men, had left those other posts\r\nempty, and quickly set up their ladders between the two Gates,\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 93.] just where a road leads from the ramparts to Muḥ.\r\nMazīd Tarkhān's houses. That post was Qūch Beg's and Muḥammad-qulī\r\n_Qūchīn's_, with their detachment of braves, and they had their quarters\r\nin Muḥ. Mazīd's houses. In the Needle-makers' Gate was posted Qarā\r\n(Black) _Barlās_, in the Bleaching-ground Gate, Qūtlūq Khwāja\r\n_Kūkūldāsh_ with Sherīm T̤aghāī and his brethren, older and younger. As\r\nattack was being made on the other side of the town, the men attached to\r\nthese posts were not on guard but had scattered to their quarters or to\r\nthe bazar for necessary matters of service and servants' work. Only the\r\nbegs were at their posts, with one or two of the populace. Qūch Beg and\r\nMūhammad-qulī and Shāh Ṣufī and one other brave did very well and\r\nboldly. Some Aūzbegs were on the ramparts, some were coming up, when\r\nthese four men arrived at a run, dealt them blow upon blow, and, by\r\nenergetic drubbing, forced them all down and put them to flight. Qūch\r\nBeg did best; this was his out-standing and approved good deed; twice\r\nduring this siege he got his hand into the work. Qarā _Barlās_ had been\r\nleft alone in the Needle-makers' Gate; he also held out well to the end.\r\nQūtlūq Khwāja and Qul-naẕar Mīrzā were also at their posts in the\r\nBleaching-ground Gate; they held out well too, and charged the foe in\r\nhis rear.\r\n\r\nAnother time Qāsim Beg led his braves out through the [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n93b.] Needle-makers' Gate, pursued the Aūzbegs as far as Khwāja Kafsher,\r\nunhorsed some and returned with a few heads.\r\n\r\nIt was now the time of ripening rain but no-one brought new corn\r\ninto the town. The long siege caused great privation to the\r\ntowns-people;[562] it went so far that the poor and destitute began to\r\neat the flesh of dogs and asses and, as there was little grain for the\r\nhorses, people fed them on leaves. Experience shewed that the leaves\r\nbest suiting were those of the mulberry and elm (_qarā-yīghāch_). Some\r\npeople scraped dry wood and gave the shavings, damped, to their horses.\r\n\r\nFor three or four months Shaibāq Khān did not come near the fort but had\r\nit invested at some distance and himself moved round it from post to\r\npost. Once when our men were off their guard, at mid-night, the enemy\r\ncame near to the Turquoise [Sidenote: Fol. 94.] Gate, beat his drums and\r\nflung his war-cry out. I was in the College, undressed. There was great\r\ntrepidation and anxiety. After that they came night after night,\r\ndisturbing us by drumming and shouting their war-cry.\r\n\r\nAlthough envoys and messengers had been sent repeatedly to all sides and\r\nquarters, no help and reinforcement arrived from any-one. No-one had\r\nhelped or reinforced me when I was in strength and power and had\r\nsuffered no sort of defeat or loss; on what score would any-one help me\r\nnow? No hope in any-one whatever recommended us to prolong the siege.\r\nThe old saying was that to hold a fort there must be a head, two hands\r\nand two legs, that is to say, the Commandant is the head; help and\r\nreinforcement coming from two quarters are the two arms and the food and\r\nwater in the fort are the two legs. While we looked for help from those\r\nround about, their thoughts were elsewhere. That brave and experienced\r\nruler, Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, gave us not even the help of an encouraging\r\nmessage, but none-the-less he sent Kamālu'd-dīn Ḥusain _Gāzur-gāhī_[563]\r\nas an envoy to Shaibāq Khān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Taṃbal's proceedings in Farghāna._)[564]\r\n\r\n(This year) Taṃbal marched from Andijān to near Bīsh-kīnt.[565] Aḥmad\r\nBeg and his party, thereupon, made The Khān move out against him. The\r\ntwo armies came face to face near [Sidenote: Fol. 94b.] Lak-lakān and\r\nthe Tūrāk Four-gardens but separated without engaging. Sl. Maḥmūd was\r\nnot a fighting man; now when opposed to Taṃbal, he shewed want of\r\ncourage in word and deed. Aḥmad Beg was unpolished[566] but brave and\r\nwell-meaning. In his very rough way, he said, 'What's the measure of\r\nthis person, Taṃbal? that you are so tormented with fear and fright\r\nabout him. If you are afraid to look at him, bandage your eyes before\r\nyou go out to face him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n907 AH.—JULY 17TH. 1501 TO JULY 7TH. 1502 AD.[567]\r\n\r\n(_a. Surrender of Samarkand to Shaibānī._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe siege drew on to great length; no provisions and supplies came in\r\nfrom any quarter, no succour and reinforcement from any side. The\r\nsoldiers and peasantry became hopeless and, by ones and twos, began to\r\nlet themselves down outside[568] the walls and flee. On Shaibāq Khān's\r\nhearing of the distress in the town, he came and dismounted near the\r\nLovers'-cave. I, in turn, went to Malik-muḥammad Mīrzā's dwellings in\r\nLow-lane, over against him. On one of those days, Khwāja Ḥusain's\r\nbrother, Aūzūn Ḥasan[569] came into the town with 10 or 15 of his\r\nmen,—he who, as has been told, had been the cause of Jahāngīr Mīrzā's\r\nrebellion, of my exodus from Samarkand (903 AH.—March 1498 AD.) and,\r\nagain! of what an amount of sedition and [Sidenote: Fol. 95.]\r\ndisloyalty! That entry of his was a very bold act.[570]\r\n\r\nThe soldiery and townspeople became more and more distressed. Trusted\r\nmen of my close circle began to let themselves down from the ramparts\r\nand get away; begs of known name and old family servants were amongst\r\nthem, such as Pīr Wais, Shaikh Wais and Wais _Lāgharī_.[571] Of help\r\nfrom any side we utterly despaired; no hope was left in any quarter; our\r\nsupplies and provisions were wretched, what there was was coming to an\r\nend; no more came in. Meantime Shaibāq Khān interjected talk of\r\npeace.[572] Little ear would have been given to his talk of peace, if\r\nthere had been hope or food from any side. It had to be! a sort of peace\r\nwas made and we took our departure from the town, by the Shaikh-zāda's\r\nGate, somewhere about midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Bābur leaves Samarkand._)\r\n\r\nI took my mother Khānīm out with me; two other women-folk went too, one\r\nwas Bīshka (var. Peshka)-i-Khalīfa, the other, Mīnglīk _Kūkūldāsh_.[573]\r\nAt this exodus, my elder sister, Khān-zāda Begīm fell into Shaibāq\r\nKhān's hands.[574] In the darkness of that night we lost our way[575]\r\nand wandered about amongst the main irrigation channels of Soghd. At\r\nshoot of dawn, after a hundred difficulties, we got past Khwāja Dīdār.\r\nAt the Sunnat Prayer we scrambled up the rising-ground of Qarā-būgh.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 95b.] From the north slope of Qarā-būgh we hurried on\r\npast the foot of Judūk village and dropped down into Yīlān-aūtī. On the\r\nroad I raced with Qāsim Beg and Qaṃbar-`alī (the Skinner); my horse was\r\nleading when I, thinking to look at theirs behind, twisted myself round;\r\nthe girth may have slackened, for my saddle turned and I was thrown on\r\nmy head to the ground. Although I at once got up and remounted, my brain\r\ndid not steady till the evening; till then this world and what went on\r\nappeared to me like things felt and seen in a dream or fancy. Towards\r\nafternoon we dismounted in Yīlān-aūtī, there killed a horse, spitted\r\nand roasted its flesh, rested our horses awhile and rode on. Very weary,\r\nwe reached Khalīla-village before the dawn and dismounted. From there it\r\nwas gone on to Dīzak.\r\n\r\nIn Dīzak just then was Ḥāfiẓ Muḥ. _Dūldāī's_ son, T̤āhir. There, in\r\nDīzak, were fat meats, loaves of fine flour, plenty of sweet melons and\r\nabundance of excellent grapes. From what privation we came to such\r\nplenty! From what stress to what repose!\r\n\r\n   From fear and hunger rest we won (_amānī tāptūq_);\r\n     A fresh world's new-born life we won (_jahānī tāptūq_).\r\n   From out our minds, death's dread was chased [Sidenote: Fol. 96.]\r\n      (_rafa` būldī_);\r\n     From our men the hunger-pang kept back (_dafa` būldī_).[576]\r\n\r\nNever in all our lives had we felt such relief! never in the whole\r\ncourse of them have we appreciated security and plenty so highly. Joy is\r\nbest and more delightful when it follows sorrow, ease after toil. I have\r\nbeen transported four or five times from toil to rest and from hardship\r\nto ease.[577] This was the first. We were set free from the affliction\r\nof such a foe and from the pangs of hunger and had reached the repose of\r\nsecurity and the relief of abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Bābur in Dikh-kat._)\r\n\r\nAfter three or four days of rest in Dīzak, we set out for Aūrā-tīpā.\r\nPashāghar is a little[578] off the road but, as we had occupied it for\r\nsome time (904 AH.), we made an excursion to it in passing by. In\r\nPashāghar we chanced on one of Khānīm's old servants, a teacher[579] who\r\nhad been left behind in Samarkand from want of a mount. We saw one\r\nanother and on questioning her, I found she had come there on foot.\r\n\r\nKhūb-nigār Khānīm, my mother Khānīm's younger sister[580] already must\r\nhave bidden this transitory world farewell; for they let Khānīm and me\r\nknow of it in Aūrā-tīpā. My father's mother also must have died in\r\nAndijān; this too they let us [Sidenote: Fol. 96b.] know in\r\nAūrā-tīpā.[581] Since the death of my grandfather, Yūnas Khān (892 AH.),\r\nKhānīm had not seen her (step-)mother or her younger brother and\r\nsisters, that is to say, Shāh Begīm, Sl. Maḥmūd Khān, Sulṯān-nīgār\r\nKhānīm and Daulat-sulṯān Khānīm. The separation had lasted 13 or 14\r\nyears. To see these relations she now started for Tāshkīnt.\r\n\r\nAfter consulting with Muḥ. Ḥusain Mīrzā, it was settled for us to winter\r\nin a place called Dikh-kat[582] one of the Aūrā-tīpā villages. There I\r\ndeposited my impedimenta (_aūrūq_); then set out myself in order to\r\nvisit Shāh Begīm and my Khān dādā and various relatives. I spent a few\r\ndays in Tāshkīnt and waited on Shāh Begīm and my Khān dādā. My mother's\r\nelder full-sister, Mihr-nigār Khānīm[583] had come from Samarkand and\r\nwas in Tāshkīnt. There my mother Khānīm fell very ill; it was a very bad\r\nillness; she passed through mighty risks.\r\n\r\nHis Highness Khwājaka Khwāja, having managed to get out of Samarkand,\r\nhad settled down in Far-kat; there I visited him. I had hoped my Khān\r\ndādā would shew me affection and kindness and would give me a country or\r\na district (_pargana_). He did promise me Aūrā-tīpā but Muḥ. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā. did not make it over, whether acting on his own account\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 97.] or whether upon a hint from above, is not known.\r\nAfter spending a few days with him (in Aūrā-tīpā), I went on to\r\nDikh-kat.\r\n\r\nDikh-kat is in the Aūrā-tīpā hill-tracts, below the range on the other\r\nside of which is the Macha[584] country. Its people, though Sārt,\r\nsettled in a village, are, like Turks, herdsmen and shepherds. Their\r\nsheep are reckoned at 40,000. We dismounted at the houses of the\r\npeasants in the village; I stayed in a head-man's house. He was old, 70\r\nor 80, but his mother was still alive. She was a woman on whom much life\r\nhad been bestowed for she was 111 years old. Some relation of hers may\r\nhave gone, (as was said), with Tīmūr Beg's army to Hindūstān;[585] she\r\nhad this in her mind and used to tell the tale. In Dikh-kat alone were\r\n96 of her descendants, hers and her grandchildren, great-grandchildren\r\nand grandchildren's grandchildren. Counting in the dead, 200 of her\r\ndescendants were reckoned up. Her grandchild's grandson was a strong\r\nyoung man of 25 or 26, with full black beard. While in Dikh-kat, I\r\nconstantly made excursions amongst the mountains round [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n97b.] about. Generally I went bare-foot and, from doing this so much, my\r\nfeet became so that rock and stone made no difference to them.[586] Once\r\nin one of these wanderings, a cow was seen, between the Afternoon and\r\nEvening prayers, going down by a narrow, ill-defined road. Said I, 'I\r\nwonder which way that road will be going; keep your eye on that cow;\r\ndon't lose the cow till you know where the road comes out.' Khwāja\r\nAsadu'l-lāh made his joke, 'If the cow loses her way,' he said, 'what\r\nbecomes of us?'\r\n\r\nIn the winter several of our soldiers asked for leave to Andijān because\r\nthey could make no raids with us.[587] Qāsim Beg said, with much\r\ninsistance, 'As these men are going, send something special of your own\r\nwear by them to Jahāngīr Mīrzā.' I sent my ermine cap. Again he urged,\r\n'What harm would there be if you sent something for Taṃbal also?' Though\r\nI was very unwilling, yet as he urged it, I sent Taṃbal a large\r\nbroad-sword which Nuyān _Kūkūldāsh_ had had made for himself in\r\nSamarkand. This very sword it was which, as will be told with the\r\nevents of next year, came down on my own head![588]\r\n\r\nA few days later, my grandmother, Aīsān-daulat Begīm, who, when I left\r\nSamarkand, had stayed behind, arrived in Dikh-kat [Sidenote: Fol. 98.]\r\nwith our families and baggage (_aūrūq_) and a few lean and hungry\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Shaibāq Khān raids in The Khān's country._)\r\n\r\nThat winter Shaibāq Khān crossed the Khujand river on the ice and\r\nplundered near Shāhrukhiya and Bīsh-kīnt. On hearing news of this, we\r\ngallopped off, not regarding the smallness of our numbers, and made for\r\nthe villages below Khujand, opposite Hasht-yak (One-eighth). The cold\r\nwas mightily bitter,[589] a wind not less than the Hā-darwesh[590]\r\nraging violently the whole time. So cold it was that during the two or\r\nthree days we were in those parts, several men died of it. When, needing\r\nto make ablution, I went into an irrigation-channel, frozen along both\r\nbanks but because of its swift current, not ice-bound in the middle, and\r\nbathed, dipping under 16 times, the cold of the water went quite through\r\nme. Next day we crossed the river on the ice from opposite Khaṣlār and\r\nwent on through the dark to Bīsh-kīnt.[591] Shaibāq Khān, however, must\r\nhave gone straight back after plundering the neighbourhood of\r\nShāhrukhiya.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Death of Nuyān Kūkūldāsh._)\r\n\r\nBīsh-kīnt, at that time, was held by Mullā Ḥaidar's son, `Abdu'l-minān.\r\nA younger son, named Mūmin, a worthless and dissipated person, had come\r\nto my presence in Samarkand and had received all kindness from me. This\r\nsodomite, Mūmin, for what sort of quarrel between them is not known,\r\ncherished [Sidenote: Fol. 98b.] rancour against Nuyān _Kūkūldāsh_. At\r\nthe time when we, having heard of the retirement of the Aūzbegs, sent a\r\nman to The Khān and marched from Bīsh-kīnt to spend two or three days\r\namongst the villages in the Blacksmith's-dale,[592] Mullā Ḥaidar's son,\r\nMūmin invited Nuyān _Kūkūldāsh_ and Aḥmad-i-qāsim and some others in\r\norder to return them hospitality received in Samarkand. When I left\r\nBīsh-kīnt, therefore they stayed behind. Mūmin's entertainment to this\r\nparty was given on the edge of a ravine (_jar_). Next day news was\r\nbrought to us in Sām-sīrak, a village in the Blacksmith's-dale, that\r\nNuyān was dead through falling when drunk into the ravine. We sent his\r\nown mother's brother, Ḥaq-naẕar and others, who searched out where he\r\nhad fallen. They committed Nuyān to the earth in Bīsh-kīnt, and came\r\nback to me. They had found the body at the bottom of the ravine an\r\narrow's flight from the place of the entertainment. Some suspected that\r\nMūmin, nursing his trumpery rancour, had taken Nuyān's life. None knew\r\nthe truth. His death made me strangely sad; for few men have I felt such\r\ngrief; I wept unceasingly for a week or [Sidenote: Fol. 99.] ten days.\r\nThe chronogram of his death was found in _Nuyān is dead_.[593]\r\n\r\nWith the heats came the news that Shaibāq Khān was coming up into\r\nAūrā-tīpā. Hereupon, as the land is level about Dikh-kat, we crossed the\r\nĀb-burdan pass into the Macha hill-country.[594] Āb-burdan is the last\r\nvillage of Macha; just below it a spring sends its water down (to the\r\nZar-afshān); above the stream is included in Macha, below it depends on\r\nPalghar. There is a tomb at the spring-head. I had a rock at the side of\r\nthe spring-head shaped (_qātīrīb_) and these three couplets inscribed on\r\nit;—\r\n\r\n   I have heard that Jamshīd, the magnificent,\r\n   Inscribed on a rock at a fountain-head[595]\r\n   'Many men like us have taken breath at this fountain,\r\n   And have passed away in the twinkling of an eye;\r\n   We took the world by courage and might,\r\n   But we took it not with us to the tomb.'\r\n\r\nThere is a custom in that hill-country of cutting verses and things[596]\r\non the rocks.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in Macha, Mullā Hijrī,[597] the poet, came from Ḥiṣār and\r\nwaited on me. At that time I composed the following opening lines;—\r\n\r\n   Let your portrait flatter you never so much, than it you are more\r\n     (_āndīn artūqsīn_);\r\n   Men call you their Life (_Jān_), than Life, without doubt, you are\r\n     more (_jāndīn artūqsīn_).[598]\r\n\r\nAfter plundering round about in Aūrā-tīpā, Shaibāq Khān retired.[599]\r\nWhile he was up there, we, disregarding the fewness [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n99b.] of our men and their lack of arms, left our impedimenta (_aūrūq_)\r\nin Macha, crossed the Āb-burdan pass and went to Dikh-kat so that,\r\ngathered together close at hand, we might miss no chance on one of the\r\nnext nights. He, however, retired straightway; we went back to Macha.\r\n\r\nIt passed through my mind that to wander from mountain to mountain,\r\nhomeless and houseless, without country or abiding-place, had nothing to\r\nrecommend it. 'Go you right off to The Khān,' I said to myself. Qāsim\r\nBeg was not willing for this move, apparently being uneasy because, as\r\nhas been told, he had put Mughūls to death at Qarā-būlāq, by way of\r\nexample. However much we urged it, it was not to be! He drew off for\r\nḤiṣār with all his brothers and his whole following. We for our part,\r\ncrossed the Āb-burdan pass and set forward for The Khān's presence in\r\nTāshkīnt.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Bābur with The Khān._)\r\n\r\nIn the days when Taṃbal had drawn his army out and gone into the\r\nBlacksmith's-dale,[600] men at the top of his army, such as Muḥ.\r\n_Dūghlāt_, known as _Ḥiṣārī_, and his younger brother Ḥusain, and also\r\nQaṃbar-`alī, the Skinner, conspired to attempt his life. When he\r\ndiscovered this weighty matter, they, unable to remain with him, had\r\ngone to The Khān.\r\n\r\nThe Feast of Sacrifices (`Īd-i-qurbān) fell for us in Shāh-rukhiya\r\n(Ẕū'l-ḥijja 10th.-June 16th. 1502).\r\n\r\nI had written a quatrain in an ordinary measure but was in some doubt\r\nabout it, because at that time I had not studied [Sidenote: Fol. 100.]\r\npoetic idiom so much as I have now done. The Khān was good-natured and\r\nalso he wrote verses, though ones somewhat deficient in the requisites\r\nfor odes. I presented my quatrain and I laid my doubts before him but\r\ngot no reply so clear as to remove them. His study of poetic idiom\r\nappeared to have been somewhat scant. Here is the verse;—\r\n\r\n   One hears no man recall another in trouble (_miḥnat-ta kīshī_);\r\n   None speak of a man as glad in his exile (_ghurbat-ta kīshī_);\r\n   My own heart has no joy in this exile;\r\n   Called glad is no exile, man though he be (_albatta kīshī_).\r\n\r\nLater on I came to know that in Turkī verse, for the purpose of rhyme,\r\n_ta_ and _da_ are interchangeable and also _ghain_, _qāf_ and\r\n_kāf_.[601]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. The acclaiming of the standards._)\r\n\r\nWhen, a few days later, The Khān heard that Taṃbal had gone up into\r\nAūrā-tīpā, he got his army to horse and rode out from Tāshkīnt. Between\r\nBīsh-kīnt and Sām-sīrak he formed up into array of right and left and\r\nsaw the count[602] of his men. This done, the standards were acclaimed\r\nin Mughūl fashion.[603] The Khān dismounted and nine standards were set\r\nup in front of him. A Mughūl tied a long strip of white cloth to the\r\nthigh-bone (_aūrta aīlīk_) of a cow and took the other end in his hand.\r\nThree other long strips of white cloth were tied to the staves of three\r\nof the (nine) standards, just below the yak-tails, and their other ends\r\nwere brought for The Khān to stand on one and for me and Sl. Muḥ.\r\nKhānika to stand each on one of the two others. The Mughūl who had hold\r\nof the strip of cloth [Sidenote: Fol. 100b.] fastened to the cow's leg,\r\nthen said something in Mughūl while he looked at the standards and made\r\nsigns towards them. The Khān and those present sprinkled _qumīz_[604] in\r\nthe direction of the standards; hautbois and drums were sounded towards\r\nthem;[605] the army flung the war-cry out three times towards them,\r\nmounted, cried it again and rode at the gallop round them.\r\n\r\nPrecisely as Chīngīz Khān laid down his rules, so the Mughūls still\r\nobserve them. Each man has his place, just where his ancestors had it;\r\nright, right,—left, left,—centre, centre. The most reliable men go to\r\nthe extreme points of the right and left. The Chīrās and Begchīk clans\r\nalways demand to go to the point in the right.[606] At that time the Beg\r\nof the Chīrās tūmān was a very bold brave, Qāshka (Mole-marked) Maḥmud\r\nand the beg of the renowned Begchīk tūmān was Ayūb _Begchīk_. These two,\r\ndisputing which should go out to the point, drew swords on one another.\r\nAt last it seems to have been settled that one should take the highest\r\nplace in the hunting-circle, the other, in the battle-array.\r\n\r\nNext day after making the circle, it was hunted near Sāmsīrak;\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 101.] thence move was made to the Tūrāk Four-gardens.\r\nOn that day and in that camp, I finished the first ode I ever finished.\r\nIts opening couplet is as follows;—\r\n\r\n   Except my soul, no friend worth trust found I (_wafādār tāpmādīm_);\r\n   Except my heart, no confidant found I (_asrār tāpmādīm_).\r\n\r\nThere were six couplets; every ode I finished later was written just on\r\nthis plan.\r\n\r\nThe Khān moved, march by march, from Sām-sīrak to the bank of the\r\nKhujand-river. One day we crossed the water by way of an excursion,\r\ncooked food and made merry with the braves and pages. That day some-one\r\nstole the gold clasp of my girdle. Next day Bayān-qulī's Khān-qulī and\r\nSl. Muḥ. Wais fled to Taṃbal. Every-one suspected them of that bad deed.\r\nThough this was not ascertained, Aḥmad-i-qāsim _Kohbur_ asked leave and\r\nwent away to Aūrā-tīpā. From that leave he did not return; he too went\r\nto Taṃbal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n908 AH.—JULY 7TH. 1502 TO JUNE 26TH. 1503 AD.[607]\r\n\r\n(_a. Bābur's poverty in Tāshkīnt._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis move of The Khān's was rather unprofitable; to take no fort, to\r\nbeat no foe, he went out and went back.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay in Tāshkīnt, I endured much poverty and humiliation. No\r\ncountry or hope of one! Most of my retainers dispersed, those left,\r\nunable to move about with me because of their destitution! If I went to\r\nmy Khān dādā's Gate,[608] I went sometimes with one man, sometimes with\r\ntwo. It was well he was no stranger but one of my own blood. [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 101b.] After showing myself[609] in his presence, I used to go to\r\nShāh Begīm's, entering her house, bareheaded and barefoot, just as if it\r\nwere my own.\r\n\r\nThis uncertainty and want of house and home drove me at last to despair.\r\nSaid I, 'It would be better to take my head[610] and go off than live in\r\nsuch misery; better to go as far as my feet can carry me than be seen of\r\nmen in such poverty and humiliation.' Having settled on China to go to,\r\nI resolved to take my head and get away. From my childhood up I had\r\nwished to visit China but had not been able to manage it because of\r\nruling and attachments. Now sovereignty itself was gone! and my mother,\r\nfor her part, was re-united to her (step)-mother and her younger\r\nbrother. The hindrances to my journey had been removed; my anxiety for\r\nmy mother was dispelled. I represented (to Shāh Begīm and The Khān)\r\nthrough Khwāja Abū'l-makāram that now such a foe as Shaibāq Khān had\r\nmade his appearance, Mughūl and Turk[611] alike must guard against him;\r\nthat thought about him must be taken while he had not well-mastered the\r\n(Aūzbeg) horde or grown very strong, for as they have said;—[612]\r\n\r\n   To-day, while thou canst, quench the fire,\r\n   Once ablaze it will burn up the world;\r\n   Let thy foe not fix string to his bow,\r\n   While an arrow of thine can pierce him;\r\n\r\nthat it was 20 or 25 years[613] since they had seen the Younger Khān\r\n(Aḥmad _Alacha_) and that I had never seen him; should I be able, if I\r\nwent to him, not only to see him myself, but to bring about the meeting\r\nbetween him and them?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 102.] Under this pretext I proposed to get out of those\r\nsurroundings;[614] once in Mughūlistān and Turfān, my reins would be in\r\nmy own hands, without check or anxiety. I put no-one in possession of my\r\nscheme. Why not? Because it was impossible for me to mention such a\r\nscheme to my mother, and also because it was with other expectations\r\nthat the few of all ranks who had been my companions in exile and\r\nprivation, had cut themselves off with me and with me suffered change of\r\nfortune. To speak to them also of such a scheme would be no pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe Khwāja, having laid my plan before Shāh Begīm and The Khān,\r\nunderstood them to consent to it but, later, it occurred to them that I\r\nmight be asking leave a second time,[615] because of not receiving\r\nkindness. That touching their reputation, they delayed a little to give\r\nthe leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. The Younger Khān comes to Tāshkīnt._)\r\n\r\nAt this crisis a man came from the Younger Khān to say that he was\r\nactually on his way. This brought my scheme to naught. When a second\r\nman announced his near approach, we all went out to give him honourable\r\nmeeting, Shāh Begīm and his younger sisters, Sulṯān-nigār Khānīm and\r\nDaulat-sulṯān Khānīm, and I and Sl. Muḥ. Khānika and Khān Mīrzā (Wais).\r\n\r\nBetween Tāshkīnt and Sairām is a village called Yagha (var. Yaghma),\r\nwith some smaller ones, where are the tombs of Father Abraham and Father\r\nIsaac. So far we went out. Knowing nothing exact about his coming,[616]\r\nI rode out for an [Sidenote: Fol. 102b.] excursion, with an easy mind.\r\nAll at once, he descended on me, face to face. I went forward; when I\r\nstopped, he stopped. He was a good deal perturbed; perhaps he was\r\nthinking of dismounting in some fixed spot and there seated, of\r\nreceiving me ceremoniously. There was no time for this; when we were\r\nnear each other, I dismounted. He had not time even to dismount;[617] I\r\nbent the knee, went forward and saw him. Hurriedly and with agitation,\r\nhe told Sl. Sa`īd Khān and Bābā Khān Sl. to dismount, bend the knee with\r\n(_bīla_) me and make my acquaintance.[618] Just these two of his sons\r\nhad come with him; they may have been 13 or 14 years old. When I had\r\nseen them, we all mounted and went to Shāh Begīm's presence. After he\r\nhad seen her and his sisters, and had renewed acquaintance, they all sat\r\ndown and for half the night told one another particulars of their past\r\nand gone affairs.\r\n\r\nNext day, my Younger Khān dādā bestowed on me arms of his own and one of\r\nhis own special horses saddled, and a Mughūl head-to-foot dress,—a\r\nMughūl cap,[619] a long coat of Chinese satin, with broidering of\r\nstitchery,[620] and Chinese armour; in the old fashion, they had hung,\r\non the left side, a haversack (_chantāī_) and an outer bag,[621] and\r\nthree or four things such as women usually hang on their collars,\r\nperfume-holders and various receptacles;[622] in the same way, three or\r\nfour things hung on the right side also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 103.] From there we went to Tāshkīnt. My Elder Khān dādā\r\nalso had come out for the meeting, some 3 or 4 _yīghāch_ (12 to 15 m.)\r\nalong the road. He had had an awning set up in a chosen spot and was\r\nseated there. The Younger Khān went up directly in front of him; on\r\ngetting near, fetched a circle, from right to left, round him; then\r\ndismounted before him. After advancing to the place of interview\r\n(_kūrūshūr yīr_), he nine times bent the knee; that done, went close and\r\nsaw (his brother). The Elder Khān, in his turn, had risen when the\r\nYounger Khān drew near. They looked long at one another (_kūrūshtīlār_)\r\nand long stood in close embrace (_qūchūshūb_). The Younger Khān again\r\nbent the knee nine times when retiring, many times also on offering his\r\ngift; after that, he went and sat down.\r\n\r\nAll his men had adorned themselves in Mughūl fashion. There they were in\r\nMughūl caps (_būrk_); long coats of Chinese satin, broidered with\r\nstitchery, Mughūl quivers and saddles of green shagreen-leather, and\r\nMughūl horses adorned in a unique fashion. He had brought rather few\r\nmen, over 1000 and under 2000 may-be. He was a man of singular manners,\r\na mighty master of the sword, and brave. Amongst arms he preferred to\r\ntrust to the sword. He used to say that of arms there are, the\r\n_shash-par_[623] (six-flanged mace), the _piyāzī_ (rugged mace), the\r\n_kīstin_,[624] the _tabar-zīn_ (saddle-hatchet) and the _bāltū_\r\n(battle-axe), all, if they strike, work only with what of them first\r\ntouches, but the sword, if it touch, works from point to hilt. He never\r\nparted with his keen-edged sword; it was either at his waist or to his\r\nhand. He was a little rustic and rough-of-speech, [Sidenote: Fol. 103b.]\r\nthrough having grown up in an out-of-the-way place.\r\n\r\nWhen, adorned in the way described, I went with him to The Khān, Khwāja\r\nAbū'l-makāram asked, 'Who is this honoured sulṯān?' and till I spoke,\r\ndid not recognize me.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. The Khāns march into Farghāna against Taṃbal._)\r\n\r\nSoon after returning to Tāshkīnt, The Khān led out an army for Andikān\r\n(Andijān) direct against Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_.[625] He took the road over\r\nthe Kīndīrlīk-pass and from Blacksmiths'-dale (Āhangarān-julgasī) sent\r\nthe Younger Khān and me on in advance. After the pass had been crossed,\r\nwe all met again near Zarqān (var. Zabarqān) of Karnān.\r\n\r\nOne day, near Karnān, they numbered their men[626] and reckoned them up\r\nto be 30,000. From ahead news began to come that Taṃbal also was\r\ncollecting a force and going to Akhsī. After having consulted together,\r\nThe Khāns decided to join some of their men to me, in order that I might\r\ncross the Khujand-water, and, marching by way of Aūsh and Aūzkīnt, turn\r\nTaṃbal's rear. Having so settled, they joined to me Ayūb _Begchīk_ with\r\nhis _tūmān_, Jān-ḥasan Bārīn (var. Nārīn) with his Bārīns, Muḥ. _Ḥiṣārī\r\nDūghlāt_, Sl. Ḥusain _Dūghlāt_ and Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā _Dūghlāt_, not in\r\ncommand of the Dūghlāt _tūmān_,—and Qaṃbar-`alī Beg (the Skinner). The\r\ncommandant (_darogha_) of their force was Sārīgh-bāsh (Yellow-head)\r\nMīrza _Itārchī_.[627]\r\n\r\nLeaving The Khāns in Karnān, we crossed the river on rafts near Sakan,\r\ntraversed the Khūqān sub-district (_aūrchīn_), crushed [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n104.] Qabā and by way of the Alāī sub-districts[628] descended suddenly\r\non Aūsh. We reached it at dawn, unexpected; those in it could but\r\nsurrender. Naturally the country-folk were wishing much for us, but they\r\nhad not been able to find their means, both through dread of Taṃbal and\r\nthrough our remoteness. After we entered Aūsh, the hordes and the\r\nhighland and lowland tribes of southern and eastern Andijān came in to\r\nus. The Aūzkīnt people also, willing to serve us, sent me a man and came\r\nin.\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on Aūzkīnt._) Aūzkīnt formerly must have been\r\n   a capital of Farghāna;[629] it has an excellent fort and is\r\n   situated on the boundary (of Farghāna).\r\n\r\nThe Marghīnānīs also came in after two or three days, having beaten and\r\nchased their commandant (_darogha_). Except Andijān, every fort south of\r\nthe Khujand-water had now come in to us. Spite of the return in those\r\ndays of so many forts, and spite of risings and revolt against him,\r\nTaṃbal did not yet come to his senses but sat down with an army of horse\r\nand foot, fortified with ditch and branch, to face The Khāns, between\r\nKarnān and Akhsī. Several times over there was a little fighting and\r\npell-mell but without decided success to either side.\r\n\r\nIn the Andijān country (_wilāyat_), most of the tribes and [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 104b.] hordes and the forts and all the districts had come in to\r\nme; naturally the Andijānīs also were wishing for me. They however could\r\nnot find their means.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Bābur's attempt to enter Andijān frustrated by a mistake._)\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that if we went one night close to the town and sent a\r\nman in to discuss with the Khwāja[630] and notables, they might perhaps\r\nlet us in somewhere. With this idea we rode out from Aūsh. By midnight\r\nwe were opposite Forty-daughters (Chihil-dukhterān) 2 miles (one\r\n_kuroh_) from Andijān. From that place we sent Qaṃbar-`alī Beg forward,\r\nwith some other begs, who were to discuss matters with the Khwāja after\r\nby some means or other getting a man into the fort. While waiting for\r\ntheir return, we sat on our horses, some of us patiently humped up, some\r\nwrapt away in dream, when suddenly, at about the third watch, there rose\r\na war-cry[631] and a sound of drums. Sleepy and startled, ignorant\r\nwhether the foe was many or few, my men, without looking to one another,\r\ntook each his own road and turned for flight. There was no time for me\r\nto get at them; I went straight for the enemy. Only Mīr Shāh _Qūchīn_\r\nand Bābā Sher-zād (Tiger-whelp) and Nāṣir's Dost sprang forward; we four\r\nexcepted, every man set his face for flight. I had gone a little way\r\nforward, when the enemy rode rapidly up, flung out his war-cry and\r\npoured arrows on us. One man, on a horse with a starred forehead,[632]\r\ncame close to me; I shot at it; it rolled over and died. They made a\r\nlittle as if to retire. The three [Sidenote: Fol. 105.] with me said,\r\n'In this darkness it is not certain whether they are many or few; all\r\nour men have gone off; what harm could we four do them? Fighting must be\r\nwhen we have overtaken our run-aways and rallied them.' Off we hurried,\r\ngot up with our men and beat and horse-whipped some of them, but, do\r\nwhat we would, they would not make a stand. Back the four of us went to\r\nshoot arrows at the foe. They drew a little back but when, after a\r\ndischarge or two, they saw we were not more than three or four, they\r\nbusied themselves in chasing and unhorsing my men. I went three or four\r\ntimes to try to rally my men but all in vain! They were not to be\r\nbrought to order. Back I went with my three and kept the foe in check\r\nwith our arrows. They pursued us two or three _kuroh_ (4-6 m.), as far\r\nas the rising ground opposite Kharābūk and Pashāmūn. There we met Muḥ.\r\n`Alī _Mubashir_. Said I, 'They are only few; let us stop and put our\r\nhorses at them.' So we did. When we got up to them, they stood\r\nstill.[633]\r\n\r\nOur scattered braves gathered in from this side and that, but several\r\nvery serviceable men, scattering in this attack, went right away to\r\nAūsh.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the affair seemed to be that some of Ayūb _Begchīk's_\r\nMughūls had slipped away from Aūsh to raid near Andijān and, hearing the\r\nnoise of our troop, came somewhat stealthily towards us; then there\r\nseems to have been confusion about the pass-word. The pass-words settled\r\non for use during this movement of ours were Tāshkīnt and Sairām. If\r\nTāshkīnt were said, Sairām would be answered; if Sairām, Tāshkīnt. In\r\nthis muddled affair, Khwāja Muḥ. `Ali seems to have been somewhat in\r\nadvance of our party and to have got bewildered,—he was a Sārt\r\nperson,[635]—when the Mughūls came up saying, 'Tāshkīnt, Tāshkīnt,' for\r\nhe gave them 'Tāshkīnt, Tāshkīnt,' as the counter-sign. Through this\r\nthey took him for an enemy, raised their war-cry, beat their\r\nsaddle-drums and poured arrows on us. It was through this we gave way,\r\nand through this false alarm were scattered! We went back to Aūsh.\r\n\r\n   [Sidenote: Fol. 105b.] (_Author's note on pass-words._)\r\n   Pass-words are of two kinds;—in each tribe there is one for\r\n   use in the tribe, such as _Darwāna_ or _Tūqqāī_ or\r\n   _Lūlū_;[634] and there is one for the use of the whole army.\r\n   For a battle, two words are settled on as pass-words so that\r\n   of two men meeting in the fight, one may give the one, the\r\n   other give back the second, in order to distinguish friends\r\n   from foes, own men from strangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Bābur again attempts Andijān._)\r\n\r\nThrough the return to me of the forts and the highland and lowland\r\nclans, Taṃbal and his adherents lost heart and footing. His army and\r\npeople in the next five or six days began to desert him and to flee to\r\nretired places and the open country.[636] Of his household some came and\r\nsaid, 'His affairs are nearly ruined; he will break up in three or four\r\ndays, utterly ruined.' On hearing this, we rode for Andijān.\r\n\r\nSl. Muḥ. _Galpuk_[637] was in Andijān,—the younger of Taṃbal's cadet\r\nbrothers. We took the Mulberry-road and at the Mid-day Prayer came to\r\nthe Khākān (canal), south of the town. A [Sidenote: Fol. 106.]\r\nforaging-party was arranged; I followed it along Khākān to the skirt of\r\n`Aīsh-hill. When our scouts brought word that Sl. Muḥ. _Galpuk_ had come\r\nout, with what men he had, beyond the suburbs and gardens to the skirt\r\nof `Aīsh, I hurried to meet him, although our foragers were still\r\nscattered. He may have had over 500 men; we had more but many had\r\nscattered to forage. When we were face to face, his men and ours may\r\nhave been in equal number. Without caring about order or array, down we\r\nrode on them, loose rein, at the gallop. When we got near, they could\r\nnot stand; there was not so much fighting as the crossing of a few\r\nswords. My men followed them almost to the Khākān Gate, unhorsing one\r\nafter another.\r\n\r\nIt was at the Evening Prayer that, our foe outmastered, we reached\r\nKhwāja Kitta, on the outskirts of the suburbs. My idea was to go quickly\r\nright up to the Gate but Dost Beg's father, Nāṣir Beg and Qaṃbar-`alī\r\nBeg, old and experienced begs both, represented to me, 'It is almost\r\nnight; it would be ill-judged to go in a body into the fort in the dark;\r\nlet us withdraw a little and dismount. What can they do to-morrow but\r\nsurrender the place?' Yielding at once to the opinion of these\r\nexperienced persons, we forthwith retired to the outskirts of the\r\nsuburbs. If we had gone to the Gate, undoubtedly, Andijān [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 106b.] would have come into our hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Bābur surprised by Taṃbal._)\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Khākān-canal, we dismounted, near the Bed-time\r\nprayer, at the side of the village of Rabāṯ-i-zauraq (var. rūzaq).\r\nAlthough we knew that Taṃbal had broken camp and was on his way to\r\nAndijān, yet, with the negligence of inexperience, we dismounted on\r\nlevel ground close to the village, instead of where the defensive canal\r\nwould have protected us.[638] There we lay down carelessly, without\r\nscouts or rear-ward.\r\n\r\nAt the top (_bāsh_) of the morning, just when men are in sweet sleep,\r\nQaṃbar-`alī Beg hurried past, shouting, 'Up with you! the enemy is\r\nhere!' So much he said and went off without a moment's stay. It was my\r\nhabit to lie down, even in times of peace, in my tunic; up I got\r\ninstanter, put on sword and quiver and mounted. My standard-bearer had\r\nno time to adjust my standard,[639] he just mounted with it in his hand.\r\nThere were ten or fifteen men with me when we started toward the enemy;\r\nafter riding an arrow's flight, when we came up with his scouts, there\r\nmay have been ten. Going rapidly forward, we overtook him, poured in\r\narrows on him, over-mastered his foremost men and hurried them off. We\r\nfollowed them for another arrow's flight and came up with his centre\r\nwhere Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_ himself was, with as many as [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n107.] 100 men. He and another were standing in front of his array, as if\r\nkeeping a Gate,[640] and were shouting, 'Strike, strike!' but his men,\r\nmostly, were sidling, as if asking themselves, 'Shall we run away? Shall\r\nwe not?' By this time three were left with me; one was Nāṣir's Dost,\r\nanother, Mīrzā Qulī _Kūkūldāsh_, the third, Khudāī-bīrdī _Turkmān's_\r\nKarīm-dād.[641] I shot off the arrow on my thumb,[642] aiming at\r\nTaṃbal's helm. When I put my hand into my quiver, there came out a quite\r\nnew _gosha-gīr_[643] given me by my Younger Khān dādā. It would have\r\nbeen vexing to throw it away but before I got it back into the quiver,\r\nthere had been time to shoot, maybe, two or three arrows. When once more\r\nI had an arrow on the string, I went forward, my three men even holding\r\nback. One of those two in advance, Taṃbal seemingly,[644] moved forward\r\nalso. The high-road was between us; I from my side, he, from his, got\r\nupon it and came face to face, in such a way that his right hand was\r\ntowards me, mine towards him. His horse's mail excepted, he was fully\r\naccoutred; but for sword and quiver, I was unprotected. I shot off the\r\narrow in my hand, adjusting for the attachment of his shield. With\r\nmatters in this position, they shot my right leg through. I had on the\r\ncap of my helm;[645] Taṃbal chopped [Sidenote: Fol. 107b.] so violently\r\nat my head that it lost all feeling under the blow. A large wound was\r\nmade on my head, though not a thread of the cap was cut.[646] I had not\r\nbared[647] my sword; it was in the scabbard and I had no chance to draw\r\nit. Single-handed, I was alone amongst many foes. It was not a time to\r\nstand still; I turned rein. Down came a sword again; this time on my\r\narrows. When I had gone 7 or 8 paces, those same three men rejoined\r\nme.[648] After using his sword on me, Taṃbal seems to have used it on\r\nNāṣir's Dost. As far as an arrrow flies to the butt, the enemy followed\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe Khākān-canal is a great main-channel, flowing in a deep cutting, not\r\neverywhere to be crossed. God brought it right! we came exactly opposite\r\na low place where there was a passage over. Directly we had crossed, the\r\nhorse Nāṣir's Dost was on, being somewhat weakly, fell down. We stopped\r\nand remounted him, then drew off for Aūsh, over the rising-ground\r\nbetween Farāghīna and Khirābūk. Out on the rise, Mazīd T̤aghāī came up\r\nand joined us. An arrow had pierced his right leg also and though it had\r\nnot gone through and come out again, he got to Aūsh with difficulty. The\r\nenemy unhorsed (_tūshūrdīlār_) good men of mine; Nāṣir Beg, Muḥ. `Alī\r\n_Mubashir_, Khwāja Muḥ. `Alī, Khusrau _Kūkūldāsh_, Na`man the page, all\r\nfell (to them, _tūshtīlār_), and also many unmailed braves.[649]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. The Khāns move from Kāsān to Andijān._)\r\n\r\nThe Khāns, closely following on Taṃbal, dismounted near Andijān,—the\r\nElder at the side of the Reserve (_qūrūq_) in the [Sidenote: Fol. 108.]\r\ngarden, known as Birds'-mill (_Qūsh-tīgīrmān_), belonging to my\r\ngrandmother, Aīsān-daulat Begīm,—the Younger, near Bābā Tawakkul's\r\nAlms-house. Two days later I went from Aūsh and saw the Elder Khān in\r\nBirds'-mill. At that interview, he simply gave over to the Younger Khān\r\nthe places which had come in to me. He made some such excuse as that for\r\nour advantage, he had brought the Younger Khān, how far! because such a\r\nfoe as Shaibāq Khān had taken Samarkand and was waxing greater; that the\r\nYounger Khān had there no lands whatever, his own being far away; and\r\nthat the country under Andijān, on the south of the Khujand-water, must\r\nbe given him to encamp in. He promised me the country under Akhsī, on\r\nthe north of the Khujand-water. He said that after taking a firm grip of\r\nthat country (Farghāna), they would move, take Samarkand, give it to me\r\nand then the whole of the Farghāna country was to be the Younger Khan's.\r\nThese words seem to have been meant to deceive me, since there is no\r\nknowing what they would have done when they had attained their object.\r\nIt had to be however! willy-nilly, I agreed.\r\n\r\nWhen, leaving him, I was on my way to the Younger Khān's presence,\r\nQaṃbar-`alī, known as the Skinner, joined me in a friendly way and said,\r\n'Do you see? They have taken the whole of the country just become yours.\r\nThere is no opening for you through them. You have in your hands Aūsh,\r\nMarghīnān, [Sidenote: Fol. 108b.] Aūzkīnt and the cultivated land and\r\nthe tribes and the hordes; go you to Aūsh; make that fort fast; send a\r\nman to Taṃbal, make peace with him, then strike at the Mughūl and drive\r\nhim out. After that, divide the districts into an elder and a younger\r\nbrother's shares.' 'Would that be right?' said I. 'The Khāns are my\r\nblood relations; better serve them than rule for Taṃbal.' He saw that\r\nhis words had made no impression, so turned back, sorry he had spoken. I\r\nwent on to see my Younger Khān Dādā. At our first interview, I had come\r\nupon him without announcement and he had no time to dismount, so it was\r\nall rather unceremonious. This time I got even nearer perhaps, and he\r\nran out as far as the end of the tent-ropes. I was walking with some\r\ndifficulty because of the wound in my leg. We met and renewed\r\nacquaintance; then he said, 'You are talked about as a hero, my young\r\nbrother!' took my arm and led me into his tent. The tents pitched were\r\nrather small and through his having grown up in an out-of-the-way place,\r\nhe let the one he sat in be neglected; it was like a raider's, melons,\r\ngrapes, saddlery, every sort of thing, in his sitting-tent. I went from\r\nhis presence straight back to my own camp and there he sent his Mughūl\r\nsurgeon to examine my wound. Mughūls call a surgeon also a _bakhshī_;\r\nthis one was called Ātākā Bakhshī.[650]\r\n\r\nHe was a very skilful surgeon; if a man's brains had come [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 109.] out, he would cure it, and any sort of wound in an artery he\r\neasily healed. For some wounds his remedy was in form of a plaister, for\r\nsome medicines had to be taken. He ordered a bandage tied on[651] the\r\nwound in my leg and put no seton in; once he made me eat something like\r\na fibrous root (_yīldīz_). He told me himself, 'A certain man had his\r\nleg broken in the slender part and the bone was shattered for the\r\nbreadth of the hand. I cut the flesh open and took the bits of bone out.\r\nWhere they had been, I put a remedy in powder-form. That remedy simply\r\nbecame bone where there had been bone before.' He told many strange and\r\nmarvellous things such as surgeons in cultivated lands cannot match.\r\n\r\nThree or four days later, Qaṃbar-`alī, afraid on account of what he had\r\nsaid to me, fled (to Taṃbal) in Andijān. A few days later, The Khāns\r\njoined to me Ayūb _Begchīk_ with his _tūmān_, and Jān-ḥasan _Bārīn_ with\r\nthe Bārīn _tūmān_ and, as their army-beg, Sārīgh-bāsh Mīrzā,—1000 to\r\n2000 men in all, and sent us towards Akhsī.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Bābur's expedition to Akhsī._)\r\n\r\nShaikh Bāyazīd, a younger brother of Taṃbal, was in Akhsī; Shahbāz\r\n_Qārlūq_ was in Kāsān. At the time, Shahbāz was lying before Nū-kīnt\r\nfort; crossing the Khujand-water opposite Bīkhrātā, we hurried to fall\r\nupon him there. When, a little [Sidenote: Fol. 109b.] before dawn, we\r\nwere nearing the place, the begs represented to me that as the man would\r\nhave had news of us, it was advisable not to go on in broken array. We\r\nmoved on therefore with less speed. Shahbāz may have been really unaware\r\nof us until we were quite close; then getting to know of it, he fled\r\ninto the fort. It often happens so! Once having said, 'The enemy is on\r\nguard!' it is easily fancied true and the chance of action is lost. In\r\nshort, the experience of such things is that no effort or exertion must\r\nbe omitted, once the chance for action comes. After-repentance is\r\nuseless. There was a little fighting round the fort at dawn but we\r\ndelivered no serious attack.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of foraging, we moved from Nū-kīnt towards the hills\r\nin the direction of Bīshkhārān. Seizing his opportunity, Shahbāz\r\n_Qārlūq_ abandoned Nū-kīnt and returned to Kāsān. We went back and\r\noccupied Nū-kīnt. During those days, the army several times went out and\r\nover-ran all sides and quarters. Once they over-ran the villages of\r\nAkhsī, once those of Kāsān. Shahbāz and Long Ḥasan's adopted son, Mīrīm\r\ncame out of Kāsān to fight; they fought, were beaten, and there Mīrīm\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. The affairs of Pāp._)\r\n\r\nPāp is a strong fort belonging to Akhsī. The Pāpīs made it fast and sent\r\na man to me. We accordingly sent Sayyid Qāsim with a few braves to\r\noccupy it. They crossed the river [Sidenote: Fol. 110.] (_daryā_)\r\nopposite the upper villages of Akhsī and went into Pāp.[652] A few days\r\nlater, Sayyid Qāsim did an astonishing thing. There were at the time\r\nwith Shaikh Bāyazīd in Akhsī, Ibrāhīm _Chāpūk_ (Slash-face)\r\nT̤aghāī,[653] Aḥmad-of-qāsim _Kohbur_, and Qāsim Khitika (?) _Arghūn_.\r\nTo these Shaikh Bāyazīd joins 200 serviceable braves and one night sends\r\nthem to surprise Pāp. Sayyid Qāsim must have lain down carelessly to\r\nsleep, without setting a watch. They reach the fort, set ladders up, get\r\nup on the Gate, let the drawbridge down and, when 70 or 80 good men in\r\nmail are inside, goes the news to Sayyid Qāsim! Drowsy with sleep, he\r\ngets into his vest (_kūnglāk_), goes out, with five or six of his men,\r\ncharges the enemy and drives them out with blow upon blow. He cut off a\r\nfew heads and sent to me. Though such a careless lying down was bad\r\nleadership, yet, with so few, just by force of drubbing, to chase off\r\nsuch a mass of men in mail was very brave indeed.\r\n\r\nMeantime The Khāns were busy with the siege of Andijān but the garrison\r\nwould not let them get near it. The Andijān braves used to make sallies\r\nand blows would be exchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Bābur invited into Akhsī._)\r\n\r\nShaikh Bāyazīd now began to send persons to us from Akhsī to testify to\r\nwell-wishing and pressingly invite us to Akhsī. His object was to\r\nseparate me from The Khāns, by any artifice, because without me, they\r\nhad no standing-ground. [Sidenote: Fol. 110b] His invitation may have\r\nbeen given after agreeing with his elder brother, Taṃbal that if I were\r\nseparated from The Khāns, it might be possible, in my presence, to come\r\nto some arrangement with them. We gave The Khāns a hint of the\r\ninvitation. They said, 'Go! and by whatever means, lay hands on Shaikh\r\nBāyazīd.' It was not my habit to cheat and play false; here above all\r\nplaces, when promises would have been made, how was I to break them? It\r\noccurred to me however, that if we could get into Akhsī, we might be\r\nable, by using all available means, to detach Shaikh Bāyazīd from\r\nTaṃbal, when he might take my side or something might turn up to favour\r\nmy fortunes. We, in our turn, sent a man to him; compact was made, he\r\ninvited us into Akhsī and when we went, came out to meet us, bringing my\r\nyounger brother, Nāṣir Mīrzā with him. Then he took us into the town,\r\ngave us ground to camp in (_yūrt_) and to me one of my father's houses\r\nin the outer fort[654] where I dismounted.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Taṃbal asks help of Shaibāq Khān._)\r\n\r\nTaṃbal had sent his elder brother, Beg Tīlba, to Shaibāq Khān with\r\nproffer of service and invitation to enter Farghāna. At this very time\r\nShaibāq Khān's answer arrived; 'I will come,' he wrote. On hearing this,\r\nThe Khāns were all upset; they could sit no longer before Andijān and\r\nrose from before it.\r\n\r\nThe Younger Khān himself had a reputation for justice and orthodoxy, but\r\nhis Mughūls, stationed, contrary to the expectations of the\r\ntowns-people, in Aūsh, Marghīnān and other places,—places that had come\r\nin to me,—began to behave ill [Sidenote: Fol. 111.] and oppressively.\r\nWhen The Khāns had broken up from before Andijān, the Aūshīs and\r\nMarghīnānīs, rising in tumult, seized the Mughūls in their forts,\r\nplundered and beat them, drove them out and pursued them.\r\n\r\nThe Khāns did not cross the Khujand-water (for the Kīndīrlīk-pass) but\r\nleft the country by way of Marghīnān and Kand-i-badām and crossed it at\r\nKhujand, Taṃbal pursuing them as far as Marghīnān. We had had much\r\nuncertainty; we had not had much confidence in their making any stand,\r\nyet for us to go away, without clear reason, and leave them, would not\r\nhave looked well.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Bābur attempts to defend Akhsī._)\r\n\r\nEarly one morning, when I was in the Hot-bath, Jahāngīr Mīrzā came into\r\nAkhsī, from Marghīnān, a fugitive from Taṃbal. We saw one another,\r\nShaikh Bāyazīd also being present, agitated and afraid. The Mīrzā and\r\nIbrāhīm Beg said, 'Shaikh Bāyazīd must be made prisoner and we must get\r\nthe citadel into our hands.' In good sooth, the proposal was wise. Said\r\nI, 'Promise has been made; how can we break it?' Shaikh Bāyazīd went\r\ninto the citadel. Men ought to have been posted on the bridge; not even\r\nthere did we post any-one! These blunders were the fruit of\r\ninexperience. At the top of the morning came Taṃbal himself with 2 or\r\n3000 men in mail, crossed the bridge and went into the citadel. To begin\r\nwith I had had rather few men; when I first went into Akhsī some had\r\nbeen sent to other forts and some had been made commandants and\r\nsummoners all round. Left with me in Akhsī may have been something over\r\n100 men. We [Sidenote: Fol. 111b.] had got to horse with these and were\r\nposting braves at the top of one lane after another and making ready for\r\nthe fight, when Shaikh Bāyazīd and Qaṃbar-`alī (the Skinner), and\r\nMuḥammad-dost[655] came gallopping from Taṃbal with talk of peace.\r\n\r\nAfter posting those told off for the fight, each in his appointed place,\r\nI dismounted at my father's tomb for a conference, in which I invited\r\nJahāngīr Mīrzā to join. Muḥammad-dost went back to Taṃbal but\r\nQaṃbar-`alī and Shaikh Bāyazīd were present. We sat in the south porch\r\nof the tomb and were in consultation when the Mīrzā, who must have\r\nsettled beforehand with Ibrāhīm _Chāpūk_ to lay hands on those other\r\ntwo, said in my ear, 'They must be made prisoner.' Said I, 'Don't hurry!\r\nmatters are past making prisoners. See here! with terms made, the affair\r\nmight be coaxed into something. For why? Not only are they many and we\r\nfew, but they with their strength are in the citadel, we with our\r\nweakness, in the outer fort.' Shaikh Bāyazīd and Qaṃbar-`alī both being\r\npresent, Jahāngīr Mīrzā looked at Ibrāhīm Beg and made him a sign to\r\nrefrain. Whether he misunderstood to the contrary or whether he\r\npretended to misunderstand, is not known; suddenly he did the ill-deed\r\nof seizing Shaikh Bāyazīd. Braves [Sidenote: Fol. 112.] closing in from\r\nall sides, flung those two to the ground. Through this the affair was\r\ntaken past adjustment; we gave them into charge and got to horse for the\r\ncoming fight.\r\n\r\nOne side of the town was put into Jahāngīr Mīrzā's charge; as his men\r\nwere few, I told off some of mine to reinforce him. I went first to his\r\nside and posted men for the fight, then to other parts of the town.\r\nThere is a somewhat level, open space in the middle of Akhsī; I had\r\nposted a party of braves there and gone on when a large body of the\r\nenemy, mounted and on foot, bore down upon them, drove them from their\r\npost and forced them into a narrow lane. Just then I came up (the lane),\r\ngallopped my horse at them, and scattered them in flight. While I was\r\nthus driving them out from the lane into the flat, and had got my sword\r\nto work, they shot my horse in the leg; it stumbled and threw me there\r\namongst them. I got up quickly and shot one arrow off. My squire, Kahil\r\n(lazy) had a weakly pony; he got off and led it to me. Mounting this, I\r\nstarted for another lane-head. Sl. Muḥ. Wais noticed the weakness of my\r\nmount, dismounted and led me his own. I mounted that horse. Just then,\r\nQāsim Beg's son, Qaṃbar-`alī came, wounded, from Jahāngīr Mīrzā and said\r\nthe Mīrzā had [Sidenote: Fol. 112b.] been attacked some time before,\r\ndriven off in panic, and had gone right away. We were thunderstruck! At\r\nthe same moment arrived Sayyid Qāsim, the commandant of Pāp! His was a\r\nmost unseasonable visit, since at such a crisis it was well to have such\r\na strong fort in our hands. Said I to Ibrāhīm Beg, 'What's to be done\r\nnow?' He was slightly wounded; whether because of this or because of\r\nstupefaction, he could give no useful answer. My idea was to get across\r\nthe bridge, destroy it and make for Andijān. Bābā Sher-zād did very well\r\nhere. 'We will storm out at the gate and get away at once,' he said. At\r\nhis word, we set off for the Gate. Khwāja Mīr Mīrān also spoke boldly at\r\nthat crisis. In one of the lanes, Sayyid Qāsim and Nāṣir's Dost chopped\r\naway at Bāqī Khīz,[656] I being in front with Ibrāhīm Beg and Mīrzā Qulī\r\n_Kūkūldāsh_.\r\n\r\nAs we came opposite the Gate, we saw Shaikh Bāyazīd, wearing his\r\npull-over shirt[657] above his vest, coming in with three or four\r\nhorsemen. He must have been put into the charge of Jahāngīr's men in the\r\nmorning when, against my will, he was made prisoner, and they must have\r\ncarried him off when they got away. They had thought it would be well to\r\nkill him; they set him free alive. He had been released just when I\r\nchanced upon him in the Gate. I drew and shot off the arrow on my thumb;\r\nit grazed his neck, a good shot! He came confusedly in at the Gate,\r\nturned to the right and fled down a lane. We followed him instantly.\r\nMīrzā Qulī _Kūkūldāsh_ got at one man with his rugged-mace and went on.\r\nAnother man took [Sidenote: Fol. 113.] aim at Ibrāhīm Beg, but when the\r\nBeg shouted 'Hāī! Hāī!' let him pass and shot me in the arm-pit, from as\r\nnear as a man on guard at a Gate. Two plates of my Qālmāq mail were cut;\r\nhe took to flight and I shot after him. Next I shot at a man running\r\naway along the ramparts, adjusting for his cap against the battlements;\r\nhe left his cap nailed on the wall and went off, gathering his\r\nturban-sash together in his hand. Then again,—a man was in flight\r\nalongside me in the lane down which Shaikh Bāyazīd had gone. I pricked\r\nthe back of his head with my sword; he bent over from his horse till he\r\nleaned against the wall of the lane, but he kept his seat and with some\r\ntrouble, made good his flight. When we had driven all the enemy's men\r\nfrom the Gate, we took possession of it but the affair was past\r\ndiscussion because they, in the citadel, were 2000 or 3000, we, in the\r\nouter fort, 100 or 200. Moreover they had chased off Jahāngīr Mīrzā, as\r\nlong before as it takes milk to boil, and with him had gone half my men.\r\nThis notwithstanding, we sent a man, while we were in the Gate, to say\r\nto him, 'If you are near at hand, come, let us attack again.' But the\r\nmatter had gone past that! Ibrāhīm Beg, either because his horse was\r\nreally weak or because of his wound, said, 'My horse is done.' On this,\r\nSulaimān, one of Muḥ. `Alī's _Mubashir's_ servants, did a plucky thing,\r\nfor with matters [Sidenote: Fol. 113b.] as they were and none\r\nconstraining him, while we were waiting in the Gate, he dismounted and\r\ngave his horse to Ibrāhīm Beg. Kīchīk (little) `Alī, now the Governor of\r\nKoel,[658] also shewed courage while we were in the Gate; he was a\r\nretainer of Sl. Muḥ. Wais and twice did well, here and in Aūsh. We\r\ndelayed in the Gate till those sent to Jahāngīr Mīrzā came back and said\r\nhe had gone off long before. It was too late to stay there; off we\r\nflung; it was ill-judged to have stayed as long as we did. Twenty or\r\nthirty men were with me. Just as we hustled out of the Gate, a number of\r\narmed men[659] came right down upon us, reaching the town-side of the\r\ndrawbridge just as we had crossed. Banda-`alī, the maternal grandfather\r\nof Qāsim Beg's son, Ḥamza, called out to Ibrāhīm Beg, 'You are always\r\nboasting of your zeal! Let's take to our swords!' 'What hinders? Come\r\nalong!' said Ibrāhīm Beg, from beside me. The senseless fellows were for\r\ndisplaying their zeal at a time of such disaster! Ill-timed zeal! That\r\nwas no time to make stand or delay! We went off quickly, the enemy\r\nfollowing and unhorsing our men.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Bābur a fugitive before Taṃbal's men._)\r\n\r\nWhen we were passing Meadow-dome (Guṃbaz-i-chaman), two miles out of\r\nAkhsī, Ibrāhīm Beg called out to me. Looking [Sidenote: Fol. 114.] back,\r\nI saw a page of Shaikh Bāyazīd's striking at him and turned rein, but\r\nBayān-qulī's Khān-qulī, said at my side, 'This is a bad time for going\r\nback,' seized my rein and pushed ahead. Many of our men had been\r\nunhorsed before we reached Sang, 4 miles (2 _shar`ī_) out of Akhsī.[660]\r\nSeeing no pursuers at Sang, we passed it by and turned straight up its\r\nwater. In this position of our affairs there were eight men of\r\nus;—Nāṣir's Dost, Qāsim Beg's Qaṃbar-`alī, Bayān-qulī's Khān-qulī, Mīrzā\r\nQulī _Kūkūldāsh_, Nāṣir's Shāham, Sayyidī Qarā's `Abdu'l-qadūs, Khwāja\r\nḤusainī and myself, the eighth. Turning up the stream, we found, in the\r\nbroad valley, a good little road, far from the beaten track. We made\r\nstraight up the valley, leaving the stream on the right, reached its\r\nwaterless part and, near the Afternoon Prayer, got up out of it to level\r\nland. When we looked across the plain, we saw a blackness on it, far\r\naway. I made my party take cover and myself had gone to look out from\r\nhigher ground, when a number of men came at a gallop up the hill behind\r\nus. Without waiting to know whether they were many or few, we mounted\r\nand rode off. There were 20 or 25; we, as has been said, were eight. If\r\nwe had known their number at first, we should have made a good stand\r\nagainst them but we thought they would not be pursuing us, unless they\r\nhad good support behind. A [Sidenote: Fol. 114b.] fleeing foe, even if\r\nhe be many, cannot face a few pursuers, for as the saying is, '_Hāī_ is\r\nenough for the beaten ranks.'[661]\r\n\r\nKhān-qulī said, 'This will never do! They will take us all. From amongst\r\nthe horses there are, you take two good ones and go quickly on with\r\nMīrzā Qulī _Kūkūldāsh_, each with a led horse. May-be you will get\r\naway.' He did not speak ill; as there was no fighting to hand, there was\r\na chance of safety in doing as he said, but it really would not have\r\nlooked well to leave any man alone, without a horse, amongst his foes.\r\nIn the end they all dropped off, one by one, of themselves. My horse was\r\na little tired; Khān-qulī dismounted and gave me his; I jumped off at\r\nonce and mounted his, he mine. Just then they unhorsed Sayyidī Qarā's\r\n`Abdu'l-qadūs and Nāṣir's Shāham who had fallen behind. Khān-qulī also\r\nwas left. It was no time to profer help or defence; on it was gone, at\r\nthe full speed of our mounts. The horses began to flag; Dost Beg's\r\nfailed and stopped. Mine began to tire; Qaṃbar-`alī got off and gave me\r\nhis; I mounted his, he mine. He was left. Khwāja Ḥusainī was a lame man;\r\nhe turned aside to the higher ground. I was left with Mīrzā Qulī\r\n_Kūkūldāsh_. Our [Sidenote: Fol. 115.] horses could not possibly gallop,\r\nthey trotted. His began to flag. Said I, 'What will become of me, if you\r\nfall behind? Come along! let's live or die together.' Several times I\r\nlooked back at him; at last he said, 'My horse is done! It can't go on.\r\nNever mind me! You go on, perhaps you will get away.' It was a miserable\r\nposition for me; he remained behind, I was alone.\r\n\r\nTwo of the enemy were in sight, one Bābā of Sairām, the other\r\nBanda-`alī. They gained on me; my horse was done; the mountains were\r\nstill 2 miles (1 _kuroh_) off. A pile of rock was in my path. Thought I\r\nto myself, 'My horse is worn out and the hills are still somewhat far\r\naway; which way should I go? In my quiver are at least 20 arrows; should\r\nI dismount and shoot them off from this pile of rock?' Then again, I\r\nthought I might reach the hills and once there, stick a few arrows in my\r\nbelt and scramble up. I had a good deal of confidence in my feet and\r\nwent on, with this plan in mind. My horse could not possibly trot; the\r\ntwo men came within arrow's reach. [Sidenote: Fol. 115b.] For my own\r\nsake sparing my arrows, I did not shoot; they, out of caution, came no\r\nnearer. By sunset I was near the hills. Suddenly they called out, 'Where\r\nare you going in this fashion? Jahāngīr Mīrzā has been brought in a\r\nprisoner; Nāṣir Mīrzā also is in their hands.' I made no reply and went\r\non towards the hills. When a good distance further had been gone, they\r\nspoke again, this time more respectfully, dismounting to speak. I gave\r\nno ear to them but went on up a glen till, at the Bed-time prayer, I\r\nreached a rock as big as a house. Going behind it, I saw there were\r\nplaces to be jumped, where no horse could go. They dismounted again and\r\nbegan to speak like servants and courteously. Said they, 'Where are you\r\ngoing in this fashion, without a road and in the dark? Sl. Aḥmad Taṃbal\r\nwill make you _pādshāh_.' They swore this. Said I, 'My mind is not easy\r\nas to that. I cannot go to him. [Sidenote: Fol. 116.] If you think to do\r\nme timely service, years may pass before you have such another chance.\r\nGuide me to a road by which I can go to The Khān's presence. If you\r\nwill do this, I will shew you favour and kindness greater than your\r\nheart's-desire. If you will not do it, go back the way you came; that\r\nalso would be to serve me well.' Said they, 'Would to God we had never\r\ncome! But since we are here, after following you in the way we have\r\ndone, how can we go back from you? If you will not go with us, we are at\r\nyour service, wherever you go.' Said I, 'Swear that you speak the\r\ntruth.' They, for their part, made solemn oath upon the Holy Book.\r\n\r\nI at once confided in them and said, 'People have shewn me a road\r\nthrough a broad valley, somewhere near this glen; take me to it.' Spite\r\nof their oath, my trust in them was not so complete but that I gave them\r\nthe lead and followed. After 2 to 4 miles (1-2 _kuroh_), we came to the\r\nbed of a torrent. 'This will not be the road for the broad valley,' I\r\nsaid. They drew back, saying, 'That road is a long way ahead,' but it\r\nreally must have been the one we were on and they have been concealing\r\nthe fact, in order to deceive me. About half through the night, we\r\nreached another stream. This time they said, 'We have been negligent; it\r\nnow seems to us that the road through the broad valley is behind.' Said\r\nI, 'What is to be done?' Said they, 'The Ghawā road is certainly in\r\nfront; by it people cross for Far-kat.[662] They guided me for that and\r\nwe went on till in [Sidenote: Fol. 116b.] the third watch of the night\r\nwe reached the Karnān gully which comes down from Ghawā. Here Bābā\r\nSairāmī said, 'Stay here a little while I look along the Ghawā road.' He\r\ncame back after a time and said, 'Some men have gone along that road,\r\nled by one wearing a Mughūl cap; there is no going that way.' I took\r\nalarm at these words. There I was, at dawn, in the middle of the\r\ncultivated land, far from the road I wanted to take. Said I, 'Guide me\r\nto where I can hide today, and tonight when you will have laid hands on\r\nsomething for the horses, lead me to cross the Khujand-water and along\r\nits further bank.' Said they, 'Over there, on the upland, there might be\r\nhiding.'\r\n\r\nBanda-`alī was Commandant in Karnān. 'There is no doing without food for\r\nourselves or our horses;' he said, 'let me go into Karnān and bring\r\nwhat I can find.' We stopped 2 miles (1 _kuroh_) out of Karnān; he went\r\non. He was a long time away; near dawn there was no sign of him. The day\r\nhad shot when he hurried up, bringing three loaves of bread but no corn\r\nfor the horses. Each of us putting a loaf into the breast of his tunic,\r\nwe went quickly up the rise, tethered our horses there in the open\r\nvalley and went to higher ground, each to keep watch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 117.] Near mid-day, Aḥmad the Falconer went along the\r\nGhawā road for Akhsī. I thought of calling to him and of saying, with\r\npromise and fair word, 'You take those horses,' for they had had a day\r\nand a night's strain and struggle, without corn, and were utterly done.\r\nBut then again, we were a little uneasy as we did not entirely trust\r\nhim. We decided that, as the men Bābā Sairāmī had seen on the road would\r\nbe in Karnān that night, the two with me should fetch one of their\r\nhorses for each of us, and that then we should go each his own way.\r\n\r\nAt mid-day, a something glittering was seen on a horse, as far away as\r\neye can reach. We were not able to make out at all what it was. It must\r\nhave been Muḥ. Bāqir Beg himself; he had been with us in Akhsī and when\r\nwe got out and scattered, he must have come this way and have been\r\nmoving then to a hiding-place.[663]\r\n\r\nBanda-`alī and Bābā Sairāmī said, 'The horses have had no corn for two\r\ndays and two nights; let us go down into the dale and put them there to\r\ngraze.' Accordingly we rode down and put them to the grass. At the\r\nAfternoon Prayer, a horseman passed along the rising-ground where we had\r\nbeen. We recognized him for Qādīr-bīrdī, the head-man of Ghawā. 'Call\r\nhim,' I said. They called; he came. After questioning him, and speaking\r\nto him of favour and kindness, and giving him promise and fair word, I\r\nsent him to bring rope, and a grass-hook, and an axe, and material for\r\ncrossing water,[664] and corn [Sidenote: Fol. 117b.] for the horses, and\r\nfood and, if it were possible, other horses. We made tryst with him for\r\nthat same spot at the Bed-time Prayer.\r\n\r\nNear the Evening Prayer, a horseman passed from the direction of Karnān\r\nfor Ghawā. 'Who are you?' we asked. He made some reply. He must have\r\nbeen Muḥ. Bāqir Beg himself, on his way from where we had seen him\r\nearlier, going at night-fall to some other hiding-place, but he so\r\nchanged his voice that, though he had been years with me, I did not know\r\nit. It would have been well if I had recognized him and he had joined\r\nme. His passing caused much anxiety and alarm; tryst could not be kept\r\nwith Qādīr-bīrdī of Ghawā. Banda-`alī said, 'There are retired gardens\r\nin the suburbs of Karnān where no one will suspect us of being; let us\r\ngo there and send to Qādīr-bīrdī and have him brought there.' With this\r\nidea, we mounted and went to the Karnān suburbs. It was winter and very\r\ncold. They found a worn, coarse sheepskin coat and brought it to me; I\r\nput it on. They brought me a bowl of millet-porridge; I ate it and was\r\nwonderfully refreshed. 'Have you sent off the man to Qādīr-bīrdī?' said\r\nI to Banda-`alī. 'I have sent,' he said. But those luckless, clownish\r\nmannikins seem to have agreed together to send the man to Taṃbal in\r\nAkhsī!\r\n\r\nWe went into a house and for awhile my eyes closed in sleep. Those\r\nmannikins artfully said to me, 'You must not bestir yourself to leave\r\nKarnān till there is news of Qādīr-bīrdī but this house is right amongst\r\nthe suburbs; on the outskirts the orchards are empty; no-one will\r\nsuspect if we go [Sidenote: Fol. 118.] there.' Accordingly we mounted at\r\nmid-night and went to a distant orchard. Bābā Sairāmī kept watch from\r\nthe roof of a house. Near mid-day he came down and said, 'Commandant\r\nYūsuf is coming.' Great fear fell upon me! 'Find out,' I said, 'whether\r\nhe comes because he knows about me.' He went and after some exchange of\r\nwords, came back and said, 'He says he met a foot-soldier in the Gate of\r\nAkhsī who said to him, \"The pādshāh is in such a place,\" that he told\r\nno-one, put the man with Walī the Treasurer whom he had made prisoner in\r\nthe fight, and then gallopped off here.' Said I, 'How does it strike\r\nyou?' 'They are all your servants,' he said, 'you must go. What else can\r\nyou do? They will make you their ruler.' Said I, 'After such rebellion\r\nand fighting, with what confidence could I go?' We were saying this,\r\nwhen Yūsuf knelt before me, saying, 'Why should it be hidden? Sl. Aḥmad\r\nTaṃbal has no news of you, but Shaikh Bāyazīd has and he sent me here.'\r\nOn hearing this, my state of mind was miserable indeed, for well is it\r\nunderstood that nothing in the world is worse than fear for one's life.\r\n'Tell the truth!' I said, 'if the affair is likely to go on to worse, I\r\nwill make [Sidenote: Fol. 118b.] ablution.' Yūsuf swore oaths, but who\r\nwould trust them? I knew the helplessness of my position. I rose and\r\nwent to a corner of the garden, saying to myself, 'If a man live a\r\nhundred years or a thousand years, at the last nothing ...'[665]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S NOTE.\r\n\r\nFriends are likely to have rescued Bābur from his dangerous isolation.\r\nHis presence in Karnān was known both in Ghawā and in Akhsī; Muḥ. Bāqir\r\nBeg was at hand (f. 117); some of those he had dropped in his flight\r\nwould follow him when their horses had had rest; Jahāngīr was somewhere\r\nnorth of the river with the half of Bābur's former force (f. 112); The\r\nKhāns, with their long-extended line of march, may have been on the main\r\nroad through or near Karnān. If Yūsuf took Bābur as a prisoner along the\r\nAkhsī road, there were these various chances of his meeting friends.\r\n\r\nHis danger was evaded; he joined his uncles and was with them, leading\r\n1000 men (Sh. N. p. 268), when they were defeated at Archīān just before\r\nor in the season of Cancer, _i.e._ _circa_ June (T. R. p. 164). What he\r\nwas doing between the winter cold of Karnān (f. 117b) and June might\r\nhave been known from his lost pages. Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ writes at length of one\r\naffair falling within the time,—Jahāngīr's occupation of Khujand, its\r\nsiege and its capture by Shaibānī. This capture will have occurred\r\nconsiderably more than a month before the defeat of The Khāns (Sh. N. p.\r\n230).\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to decide in what month of 908 AH. they went into\r\nFarghāna or how long their campaign lasted. Bābur chronicles a series of\r\noccurrences, previous to the march of the army, which must have filled\r\nsome time. The road over the Kīndīrlīk-pass was taken, one closed in\r\nBābur's time (f. 1b) though now open through the winter. Looking at the\r\nrapidity of his own movements in Farghāna, it seems likely that the pass\r\nwas crossed after and not before its closed time. If so, the campaign\r\nmay have covered 4 or 5 months. Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ's account of Shaibāq's\r\noperations strengthens this view. News that Aḥmad had joined Maḥmūd in\r\nTāshkīnt (f. 102) went to Shaibānī in Khusrau Shāh's territories; he saw\r\nhis interests in Samarkand threatened by this combination of the\r\nChaghatāī brothers to restore Bābur in Farghāna, came north therefore in\r\norder to help Taṃbal. He then waited a month in Samarkand (Sh. N. p.\r\n230), besieged Jahāngīr, went back and stayed in Samarkand long enough\r\nto give his retainers time to equip for a year's campaigning (l. c. p.\r\n244) then went to Akhsī and so to Archīān.\r\n\r\nBābur's statement (f. 110b) that The Khāns went from Andijān to the\r\nKhujand-crossing over the Sīr attracts attention because this they might\r\nhave done if they had meant to leave Farghāna by Mīrzā-rabāṯ but they\r\nare next heard of as at Akhsī. Why did they make that great détour? Why\r\nnot have crossed opposite Akhsī or at Sang? Or if they had thought of\r\nretiring, what turned them east again? Did they place Jahāngīr in\r\nKhujand? Bābur's missing pages would have answered these questions no\r\ndoubt. It was useful for them to encamp where they did, east of Akhsī,\r\nbecause they there had near them a road by which reinforcement could\r\ncome from Kāshghar or retreat be made. The Akhsī people told Shaibānī\r\nthat he could easily overcome The Khāns if he went without warning, and\r\nif they had not withdrawn by the Kulja road (Sh. N. p. 262). By that\r\nroad the few men who went with Aḥmad to Tāshkīnt (f. 103) may have been\r\naugmented to the force, enumerated as his in the battle by Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ\r\n(Sh. N. cap. LIII.).\r\n\r\nWhen The Khāns were captured, Bābur escaped and made 'for Mughūlistān,'\r\na vague direction seeming here to mean Tāshkīnt, but, finding his road\r\nblocked, in obedience to orders from Shaibāq that he and Abū'l-makāram\r\nwere to be captured, he turned back and, by unfrequented ways, went into\r\nthe hill-country of Sūkh and Hushīār. There he spent about a year in\r\ngreat misery (f. 14 and Ḥ. S. ii, 318). Of the wretchedness of the time\r\nḤaidar also writes. If anything was attempted in Farghāna in the course\r\nof those months, record of it has been lost with Bābur's missing pages.\r\nHe was not only homeless and poor, but shut in by enemies. Only the\r\nloyalty or kindness of the hill-tribes can have saved him and his few\r\nfollowers. His mother was with him; so also were the families of his\r\nmen. How Qūtlūq-nigār contrived to join him from Tāshkīnt, though\r\nhistorically a small matter, is one he would chronicle. What had\r\nhappened there after the Mughūl defeat, was that the horde had marched\r\naway for Kāshghar while Shāh Begīm remained in charge of her daughters\r\nwith whom the Aūzbeg chiefs intended to contract alliance. Shaibānī's\r\norders for her stay and for the general exodus were communicated to her\r\nby her son, The Khān, in what Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ, quoting its purport, describes\r\nas a right beautiful letter (p. 296).\r\n\r\nBy some means Qūtlūq-nigār joined Bābur, perhaps helped by the\r\ncircumstance that her daughter, Khān-zāda was Shaibāq's wife. She spent\r\nat least some part of those hard months with him, when his fortunes were\r\nat their lowest ebb. A move becoming imperative, the ragged and\r\ndestitute company started in mid-June 1504 (Muḥ. 910 AH.) on that\r\nperilous mountain journey to which Ḥaidar applies the Prophet's dictum,\r\n'Travel is a foretaste of Hell,' but of which the end was the\r\nestablishment of a Tīmūrid dynasty in Hindūstān. To look down the years\r\nfrom the destitute Bābur to Akbar, Shāh-jahān and Aurangzīb is to see a\r\ngreat stream of human life flow from its source in his resolve to win\r\nupward, his quenchless courage and his abounding vitality. Not yet 22,\r\nthe sport of older men's intrigues, he had been tempered by failure,\r\nprivation and dangers.\r\n\r\nHe left Sūkh intending to go to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā in Khurāsān but he\r\nchanged this plan for one taking him to Kābul where a Tīmūrid might\r\nclaim to dispossess the Arghūns, then holding it since the death, in 907\r\nAH. of his uncle, Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā _Kābulī_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEMOIRS OF BABUR\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II. KĀBUL[666]\r\n\r\n910 AH.-JUNE 14TH 1504 TO JUNE 4TH 1505 AD.[667]\r\n\r\n(_a. Bābur leaves Farghāna._)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of Muḥarram, after leaving the Farghāna country [Sidenote:\r\nḤaidarābād MS. Fol. 120.] intending to go to Khurāsān, I dismounted at\r\nAīlāk-yīlāq,[668] one of the summer pastures of Ḥiṣār. In this camp I\r\nentered my 23rd year, and applied the razor to my face.[669] Those who,\r\nhoping in me, went with me into exile, were, small and great, between 2\r\nand 300; they were almost all on foot, had walking-staves in their\r\nhands, brogues[670] on their feet, and long coats[671] on their\r\nshoulders. So destitute were we that we had but two tents (_chādar_)\r\namongst us; my own used to be pitched for my mother, and they set an\r\n_ālāchūq_ at each stage for me to sit in.[672]\r\n\r\nThough we had started with the intention of going into Khurāsān, yet\r\nwith things as they were[673] something was hoped for from the Ḥiṣār\r\ncountry and Khusrau Shāh's retainers. Every few days some-one would come\r\nin from the country or a tribe or the (Mughūl) horde, whose words made\r\nit probable that we had growing ground for hope. Just then Mullā Bābā of\r\nPashāghar came back, who had been our envoy to Khusrau Shāh; from\r\nKhusrau Shāh he brought nothing likely to please, but he did from the\r\ntribes and the horde.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 120b.] Three or four marches beyond Aīlāk, when halt was\r\nmade at a place near Ḥiṣār called Khwāja `Imād, Muḥibb-`alī, the\r\nArmourer, came to me from Khusrau Shāh. Through Khusrau Shāh's\r\nterritories I have twice happened to pass;[674] renowned though he was\r\nfor kindness and liberality, he neither time showed me the humanity he\r\nhad shown to the meanest of men.\r\n\r\nAs we were hoping something from the country and the tribes, we made\r\ndelay at every stage. At this critical point Sherīm T̤aghāī, than whom\r\nno man of mine was greater, thought of leaving me because he was not\r\nkeen to go into Khurāsān. He had sent all his family off and stayed\r\nhimself unencumbered, when after the defeat at Sar-i-pul (906 AH.) I\r\nwent back to defend Samarkand; he was a bit of a coward and he did this\r\nsort of thing several times over.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Bābur joined by one of Khusrau Shāh's kinsmen._)\r\n\r\nAfter we reached Qabādīān, a younger brother of Khusrau Shāh, Bāqī\r\n_Chaghānīānī_, whose holdings were Chaghānīān,[675] Shahr-i-ṣafā and\r\nTīrmīẕ, sent the _khatīb_[676] of Qarshī to me to express his good\r\nwishes and his desire for alliance, and, after we had crossed the Amū at\r\nthe Aūbāj-ferry, he came himself to wait on me. By his wish we moved\r\ndown the river to opposite Tīrmīẕ, where, without fear [or, without\r\ngoing over himself],[677] he had their families[678] and their goods\r\nbrought across to join us. This done, we set out together for Kāhmard\r\nand Bāmīān, then held by his son[679] Aḥmad-i-qāsim, the son of Khusrau\r\nShāh's sister. Our plan was to leave the households (_awī-aīl_) safe in\r\nFort Ajar of the Kāhmard-valley and to take action wherever [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 121.] action might seem well. At Aībak, Yār-`alī Balāl,[680] who\r\nhad fled from Khusrau Shāh, joined us with several braves; he had been\r\nwith me before, and had made good use of his sword several times in my\r\npresence, but was parted from me in the recent throneless times[681] and\r\nhad gone to Khusrau Shāh. He represented to me that the Mughūls in\r\nKhusrau Shāh's service wished me well. Moreover, Qaṃbar-`alī Beg, known\r\nalso as Qaṃbar-`alī _Silākh_ (Skinner), fled to me after we reached the\r\nZindān-valley.[682]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Occurrences in Kākmard._)\r\n\r\nWe reached Kāhmard with three or four marches and deposited our\r\nhouseholds and families in Ajar. While we stayed there, Jahāngīr Mīrzā\r\nmarried (Aī Begīm) the daughter of Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā and Khān-zāda Begīm,\r\nwho had been set aside for him during the lifetime of the Mīrzās.[683]\r\n\r\nMeantime Bāqī Beg urged it upon me, again and again, that two rulers in\r\none country, or two chiefs in one army are a source of faction and\r\ndisorder—a foundation of dissension and ruin. \"For they have said, 'Ten\r\ndarwīshes can sleep under one blanket, but two kings cannot find room in\r\none clime.'\r\n\r\n   If a man of God eat half a loaf,\r\n   He gives the other to a darwīsh;\r\n   Let a king grip the rule of a clime,\r\n   He dreams of another to grip.\"[684]\r\n\r\nBāqī Beg urged further that Khusrau Shāah's retainers and followers\r\nwould be coming in that day or the next to take service with the Pādshāh\r\n(_i.e._ Bābur); that there were such [Sidenote: Fol. 121b.]\r\nsedition-mongers with them as the sons of Ayūb _Begchīk_, besides other\r\nwho had been the stirrers and spurs to disloyalty amongst their\r\nMīrzās,[685] and that if, at this point, Jahāngīr Mīrzā were dismissed,\r\non good and friendly terms, for Khurāsān, it would remove a source of\r\nlater repentance. Urge it as he would, however, I did not accept his\r\nsuggestion, because it is against my nature to do an injury to my\r\nbrethren, older or younger,[686] or to any kinsman soever, even when\r\nsomething untoward has happened. Though formerly between Jahāngīr Mīrzā\r\nand me, resentments and recriminations had occurred about our rule and\r\nretainers, yet there was nothing whatever then to arouse anger against\r\nhim; he had come out of that country (_i.e._ Farghāna) with me and was\r\nbehaving like a blood-relation and a servant. But in the end it was just\r\nas Bāqī Beg predicted;—those tempters to disloyalty, that is to say,\r\nAyūb's Yūsuf and Ayūb's Bihlūl, left me for Jahāngīr Mīrzā, took up a\r\nhostile and mutinous position, parted him from me, and conveyed him into\r\nKhurāsān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Co-operation invited against Shaibāq Khān._)\r\n\r\nIn those days came letters from Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, long and far-fetched\r\nletters which are still in my possession and in that [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n122.] of others, written to Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā, myself, Khusrau Shāh\r\nand Ẕū'n-nūn Beg, all to the same purport, as follows:—\"When the three\r\nbrothers, Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā, and Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā,\r\njoined together and advanced against me, I defended the bank of the\r\nMurgh-āb[687] in such a way that they retired without being able to\r\neffect anything. Now if the Aūzbegs advance, I might myself guard the\r\nbank of the Murgh-āb again; let Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā leave men to defend\r\nthe forts of Balkh, Shibarghān, and Andikhūd while he himself guards\r\nGirzawān, the Zang-valley, and the hill-country thereabouts.\" As he had\r\nheard of my being in those parts, he wrote to me also, \"Do you make fast\r\nKāhmard, Ajar, and that hill-tract; let Khusrau Shāh place trusty men in\r\nḤiṣār and Qūndūz; let his younger brother Walī make fast Badakhshān and\r\nthe Khutlān hills; then the Aūzbeg will retire, able to do nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThese letters threw us into despair;—for why? Because at that time there\r\nwas in Tīmūr Beg's territory (_yūrt_) no ruler so great as Sl. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā, whether by his years, armed strength, or dominions; it was to be\r\nexpected, therefore, that envoys would go, treading on each other's\r\nheels, with clear and sharp orders, such as, \"Arrange for so many boats\r\nat the Tīrmīz, [Sidenote: Fol. 122b.] Kilīf, and Kīrkī ferries,\" \"Get\r\nany quantity of bridge material together,\" and \"Well watch the ferries\r\nabove Tūqūz-aūlūm,\"[688] so that men whose spirit years of Aūzbeg\r\noppression had broken, might be cheered to hope again.[689] But how\r\ncould hope live in tribe or horde when a great ruler like Sl. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā, sitting in the place of Tīmūr Beg, spoke, not of marching forth\r\nto meet the enemy, but only of defence against his attack?\r\n\r\nWhen we had deposited in Ajar what had come with us of hungry train (_aj\r\naūrūq_) and household (_awī-aīl_), together with the families of Bāqī\r\nBeg, his son, Muḥ. Qāsim, his soldiers and his tribesmen, with all their\r\ngoods, we moved out with our men.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Increase of Bābur's following._)\r\n\r\nOne man after another came in from Khusrau Shāh's Mughūls and said, \"We\r\nof the Mughūl horde, desiring the royal welfare, have drawn off from\r\nT̤āīkhān (T̤ālīkān) towards Ishkīmīsh and Fūlūl. Let the Pādshāh advance\r\nas fast as possible, for the greater part of Khusrau Shāh's force has\r\nbroken up and is ready to take service with him.\" Just then news arrived\r\nthat Shaibāq Khān, after taking Andijān,[690] was getting to horse again\r\nagainst Ḥiṣār and Qūndūz. On hearing [Sidenote: Fol. 123.] this, Khusrau\r\nShāh, unable to stay in Qūndūz, marched out with all the men he had, and\r\ntook the road for Kābul. No sooner had he left than his old servant, the\r\nable and trusted Mullā Muḥammad _Turkistānī_ made Qūndūz fast for\r\nShaibāq Khān.\r\n\r\nThree or four thousand heads-of-houses in the Mughūl horde, former\r\ndependants of Khusrau Shāh, brought their families and joined us when,\r\ngoing by way of Sham-tū, we were near the Qīzīl-sū.[691]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Qaṃbar-`alī, the Skinner, dismissed._)\r\n\r\nQaṃbar-`alī Beg's foolish talk has been mentioned several times already;\r\nhis manners were displeasing to Bāqī Beg; to gratify Bāqī Beg, he was\r\ndismissed. Thereafter his son, `Abdu'l-shukūr, was in Jahāngīr Mīrzā's\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Khusrau Shāh waits on Bābur._)\r\n\r\nKhusrau Shāh was much upset when he heard that the Mughūl horde had\r\njoined me; seeing nothing better to do for himself, he sent his\r\nson-in-law, Ayūb's Yaq`ūb, to make profession of well-wishing and\r\nsubmission to me, and respectfully to represent that he would enter my\r\nservice if I would make terms and compact with him. His offer was\r\naccepted, because Bāqī _Chaghānīānī_ was a man of weight, and, however\r\nsteady in his favourable disposition to me, did not overlook his\r\nbrother's side in this matter. Compact was made that Khusrau Shāh's\r\nlife should be safe, and that whatever amount of his goods he selected,\r\nshould not be refused him. After giving Yaq`ūb leave to go, we marched\r\ndown the Qīzīl-sū and dismounted near to where it joins the water of\r\nAndar-āb. [Sidenote: Fol. 123b.]\r\n\r\nNext day, one in the middle of the First Rabī` (end of August, 1504\r\nAD.), riding light, I crossed the Andar-āb water and took my seat under\r\na large plane-tree near Dūshī, and thither came Khusrau Shāh, in pomp\r\nand splendour, with a great company of men. According to rule and\r\ncustom, he dismounted some way off and then made his approach. Three\r\ntimes he knelt when we saw one another, three times also on taking\r\nleave; he knelt once when asking after my welfare, once again when he\r\noffered his tribute, and he did the same with Jahāngīr Mīrzā and with\r\nMīrzā Khān (Wais). That sluggish old mannikin who through so many years\r\nhad just pleased himself, lacking of sovereignty one thing only, namely,\r\nto read the _Khuṯba_ in his own name, now knelt 25 or 26 times in\r\nsuccession, and came and went till he was so wearied out that he\r\ntottered forward. His many years of begship and authority vanished from\r\nhis view. When we had seen one another and he had offered his gift, I\r\ndesired him to be seated. We stayed in that place for one or two\r\n_garīs_,[692] exchanging tale and talk. His conversation was vapid and\r\nempty, presumably because he was a coward and false to his salt. Two\r\nthings he said were extraordinary for the time when, under his eyes, his\r\ntrusty and trusted retainers were becoming mine, and when his affairs\r\nhad reached the point that he, the sovereign-aping mannikin, had had to\r\ncome, willy-nilly, abased and unhonoured, to what sort [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n124.] of an interview! One of the things he said was this:—When condoled\r\nwith for the desertion of his men, he replied, \"Those very servants have\r\nfour times left me and returned.\" The other was said when I had asked\r\nhim where his brother Walī would cross the Amū and when he would arrive.\r\n\"If he find a ford, he will soon be here, but when waters rise, fords\r\nchange; the (Persian) proverb has it, 'The waters have carried down the\r\nfords.'\" These words God brought to his tongue in that hour of the\r\nflowing away of his own authority and following!\r\n\r\nAfter sitting a _garī_ or two, I mounted and rode back to camp, he for\r\nhis part returning to his halting-place. On that day his begs, with\r\ntheir servants, great and small, good and bad, and tribe after tribe\r\nbegan to desert him and come, with their families, to me. Between the\r\ntwo Prayers of the next afternoon not a man remained in his presence.\r\n\r\n\"Say,—O God! who possessest the kingdom! Thou givest it to whom Thou\r\nwilt and Thou takest it from whom Thou wilt! In Thy hand is good, for\r\nThou art almighty.\"[693]\r\n\r\nWonderful is His power! This man, once master of 20 or 30,000 retainers,\r\nonce owning Sl. Maḥmūd's dominions from Qaḥlūgha,—known also as the\r\nIron-gate,—to the range of [Sidenote: Fol. 124b.] Hindū-kush, whose old\r\nmannikin of a tax-gatherer, Ḥasan _Barlās_ by name, had made us march,\r\nhad made us halt, with all the tax-gatherer's roughness, from Aīlāk to\r\nAūbāj,[694] that man He so abased and so bereft of power that, with no\r\nblow struck, no sound made, he stood, without command over servants,\r\ngoods, or life, in the presence of a band of 200 or 300 men, defeated\r\nand destitute as we were.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the day on which we had seen Khusrau Shāh and gone\r\nback to camp, Mīrzā Khān came to my presence and demanded vengeance on\r\nhim for the blood of his brothers.[695] Many of us were at one with him,\r\nfor truly it is right, both by Law and common justice, that such men\r\nshould get their desserts, but, as terms had been made, Khusrau Shāh was\r\nlet go free. An order was given that he should be allowed to take\r\nwhatever of his goods he could convey; accordingly he loaded up, on\r\nthree or four strings of mules and camels, all jewels, gold, silver, and\r\nprecious things he had, and took them with him.[696] Sherīm T̤aghāī was\r\ntold off to escort him, who after setting Khusrau Shāh on his road for\r\nKhurāsān, by way of Ghūrī and Dahānah, was to go to Kāhmard and bring\r\nthe families after us to Kābul.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Bābur marches for Kābul._)\r\n\r\nMarching from that camp for Kābul, we dismounted in Khwāja Zaid.\r\n\r\nOn that day, Ḥamza Bī _Mangfīt_,[697] at the head of Aūzbeg raiders, was\r\nover-running round about Dūshī. Sayyid Qāsim, the Lord of the Gate, and\r\nAḥmad-i-qāsim _Kohbur_ were sent [Sidenote: Fol. 125.] with several\r\nbraves against him; they got up with him, beat his Aūzbegs well, cut off\r\nand brought in a few heads.\r\n\r\nIn this camp all the armour (_jība_) of Khusrau Shāh's armoury was\r\nshared out. There may have been as many as 7 or 800 coats-of-mail\r\n(_joshan_) and horse accoutrements (_kūhah_);[698] these were the one\r\nthing he left behind; many pieces of porcelain also fell into our hands,\r\nbut, these excepted, there was nothing worth looking at.\r\n\r\nWith four or five marches we reached Ghūr-bund, and there dismounted in\r\nUshtur-shahr. We got news there that Muqīm's chief beg, Sherak (var.\r\nSherka) _Arghūn_, was lying along the Bārān, having led an army out, not\r\nthrough hearing of me, but to hinder `Abdu'r-razzāq Mīrzā from passing\r\nalong the Panjhīr-road, he having fled from Kābul[699] and being then\r\namongst the Tarkalānī Afghāns towards Lamghān. On hearing this we\r\nmarched forward, starting in the afternoon and pressing on through the\r\ndark till, with the dawn, we surmounted the Hūpīān-pass.[700]\r\n\r\nI had never seen Suhail;[701] when I came out of the pass I saw a star,\r\nbright and low. \"May not that be Suhail?\" said I. Said they, \"It is\r\nSuhail.\" Bāqī _Chaghānīānī_ recited this couplet;—[702]\r\n\r\n   \"How far dost thou shine, O Suhail, and where dost thou rise?\r\n    A sign of good luck is thine eye to the man on whom it may light.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sun was a spear's-length high[703] when we reached the foot of the\r\nSanjid (Jujube)-valley and dismounted. Our scouting [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n125b.] braves fell in with Sherak below the Qarā-bāgh,[704] near\r\nAīkarī-yār, and straightway got to grips with him. After a little of\r\nsome sort of fighting, our men took the upper hand, hurried their\r\nadversaries off, unhorsed 70-80 serviceable braves and brought them in.\r\nWe gave Sherak his life and he took service with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Death of Walī of Khusrau._)\r\n\r\nThe various clans and tribes whom Khusrau Shāh, without troubling\r\nhimself about them, had left in Qūndūz, and also the Mughūl horde, were\r\nin five or six bodies (_būlāk_). One of those belonging to\r\nBadakhshān,—it was the Rūstā-hazāra,:—came, with Sayyidīm `Alī\r\n_darbān_,[705] across the Panjhīr-pass to this camp, did me obeisance\r\nand took service with me. Another body came under Ayūb's Yūsuf and\r\nAyūb's Bihlūl; it also took service with me. Another came from Khutlān,\r\nunder Khusrau Shāh's younger brother, Walī; another, consisting of the\r\n(Mughūl) tribesmen (_aīmāq_) who had been located in Yīlānchaq, Nikdiri\r\n(?), and the Qūndūz country, came also. The last-named two came by\r\nAndar-āb and Sar-i-āb,[706] meaning to cross by the Panjhīr-pass; at\r\nSar-i-āb the tribesmen were ahead; Walī came up behind; they held the\r\nroad, fought and beat him. He himself fled to the Aūzbegs,[707] and\r\nShaibāq Khān had his head struck off in the Square (_Chār-sū_) of\r\nSamarkand; his followers, beaten and plundered, came on with the\r\ntribesmen, and like these, took service with me. With them came Sayyid\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 126.] Yūsuf Beg (the Grey-wolfer).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Kābul gained._)\r\n\r\nFrom that camp we marched to the Āq-sarāī meadow of the Qarā-bāgh and\r\nthere dismounted. Khusrau Shāh's people were well practised in\r\noppression and violence; they tyrannized over one after another till at\r\nlast I had up one of Sayyidīm `Alī's good braves to my Gate[708] and\r\nthere beaten for forcibly taking a jar of oil. There and then he just\r\ndied under the blows; his example kept the rest down.\r\n\r\nWe took counsel in that camp whether or not to go at once against Kābul.\r\nSayyid Yūsuf and some others thought that, as winter was near, our first\r\nmove should be into Lamghān, from which place action could be taken as\r\nadvantage offered. Bāqī Beg and some others saw it good to move on Kābul\r\nat once; this plan was adopted; we marched forward and dismounted in\r\nĀbā-qūrūq.\r\n\r\nMy mother and the belongings left behind in Kāhmard rejoined us at\r\nĀbā-qūrūq. They had been in great danger, the particulars of which are\r\nthese:—Sherīm T̤aghāī had gone to set Khusrau Shāh on his way for\r\nKhurāsān, and this done, was to fetch the families from Kāhmard. When he\r\nreached Dahānah, he found he was not his own master; Khusrau Shāh went\r\non with him into Kāhmard, where was his sister's son, Aḥmad-i-qāsim.\r\nThese two took up an altogether wrong [Sidenote: Fol. 126b.] position\r\ntowards the families in Kāhmard. Hereupon a number of Bāqī Beg's\r\nMughūls, who were with the families, arranged secretly with Sherīm\r\nT̤aghāī to lay hands on Khusrau Shāh and Aḥmad-i-qāsim. The two heard of\r\nit, fled along the Kāhmard-valley on the Ajar side[709] and made for\r\nKhurāsān. To bring this about was really what Sherīm T̤aghāī and the\r\nMughūls wanted. Set free from their fear of Khusrau Shāh by his flight,\r\nthose in charge of the families got them out of Ajar, but when they\r\nreached Kāhmard, the Sāqānchī (var. Asīqanchī) tribe blocked the road,\r\nlike an enemy, and plundered the families of most of Bāqī Beg's\r\nmen.[710] They made prisoner Qul-i-bāyazīd's little son, Tīzak; he came\r\ninto Kābul three or four years later. The plundered and unhappy families\r\ncrossed by the Qībchāq-pass, as we had done, and they rejoined us in\r\nĀbā-qūrūq.\r\n\r\nLeaving that camp we went, with one night's halt, to the Chālāk-meadow,\r\nand there dismounted. After counsel taken, it was decided to lay siege\r\nto Kābul, and we marched forward. With what men of the centre there\r\nwere, I dismounted between Ḥaidar _Tāqī's_[711] garden and the tomb of\r\nQul-i-bāyazīd, the Taster (_bakāwal_);[712] Jahāngīr Mīrzā, with the men\r\nof the right, [Sidenote: Fol. 127.] dismounted in my great Four-gardens\r\n(_Chār-bāgh_), Nāṣir Mīrzā, with the left, in the meadow of\r\nQūtlūq-qadam's tomb. People of ours went repeatedly to confer with\r\nMuqīm; they sometimes brought excuses back, sometimes words making for\r\nagreement. His tactics were the sequel of his dispatch, directly after\r\nSherak's defeat, of a courier to his father and elder brother (in\r\nQandahār); he made delays because he was hoping in them.\r\n\r\nOne day our centre, right, and left were ordered to put on their mail\r\nand their horses' mail, to go close to the town, and to display their\r\nequipment so as to strike terror on those within. Jahāngīr Mīrzā and the\r\nright went straight forward by the Kūcha-bāgh;[713] I, with the centre,\r\nbecause there was water, went along the side of Qūtlūq-qadam's tomb to a\r\nmound facing the rising-ground;[714] the van collected above\r\nQūtlūq-qadam's bridge,—at that time, however, there was no bridge. When\r\nthe braves, showing themselves off, galloped close up to the\r\nCurriers'-gate,[715] a few who had come out through it fled in again\r\nwithout making any stand. A crowd of Kābulīs who had come out to see the\r\nsight raised a great dust when they ran away from the high slope of the\r\nglacis of the citadel (_i.e._ Bālā-ḥiṣār). A number of pits had been dug\r\nup the rise [Sidenote: Fol. 127b.] between the bridge and the gate, and\r\nhidden under sticks and rubbish; Sl. Qulī _Chūnāq_ and several others\r\nwere thrown as they galloped over them. A few braves of the right\r\nexchanged sword-cuts with those who came out of the town, in amongst\r\nthe lanes and gardens, but as there was no order to engage, having done\r\nso much, they retired.\r\n\r\nThose in the fort becoming much perturbed, Muqīm made offer through the\r\nbegs, to submit and surrender the town. Bāqī Beg his mediator, he came\r\nand waited on me, when all fear was chased from his mind by our entire\r\nkindness and favour. It was settled that next day he should march out\r\nwith retainers and following, goods and effects, and should make the\r\ntown over to us. Having in mind the good practice Khusrau Shāh's\r\nretainers had had in indiscipline and longhandedness, we appointed\r\nJahāngīr Mīrzā and Nāṣir Mīrzā with the great and household begs, to\r\nescort Muqīm's family out of Kābul[716] and to bring out Muqīm himself\r\nwith his various dependants, goods and effects. Camping-ground was\r\nassigned to him at Tīpa.[717] When the Mīrzās and the Begs went at dawn\r\nto the Gate, they saw much mobbing and tumult of the common people, so\r\nthey sent me a man to say, \"Unless you come yourself, there will be no\r\nholding these people in.\" In the end I got to horse, had two or three\r\npersons shot, two or three cut in pieces, and so stamped the rising\r\ndown. Muqīm and his belongings then got out, safe and sound, [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 128.] and they betook themselves to Tīpa.\r\n\r\nIt was in the last ten days of the Second Rabī` (Oct. 1504 AD.)[718]\r\nthat without a fight, without an effort, by Almighty God's bounty and\r\nmercy, I obtained and made subject to me Kābul and Ghaznī and their\r\ndependent districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF KĀBUL[719]\r\n\r\nThe Kābul country is situated in the Fourth climate and in the midst of\r\ncultivated lands.[720] On the east it has the Lamghānāt,[721]\r\nParashāwar (Pashāwar), Hash(t)-nagar and some of the countries of\r\nHindūstān. On the west it has the mountain region in which are Karnūd\r\n(?) and Ghūr, now the refuge and dwelling-places of the Hazāra and\r\nNikdīrī (var. Nikudārī) tribes. On the north, separated from it by the\r\nrange of Hindū-kush, it has the Qūndūz and Andar-āb countries. On the\r\nsouth, it has Farmūl, Naghr (var. Naghz), Bannū and Afghānistān.[722]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Town and environs of Kābul._)\r\n\r\nThe Kābul district itself is of small extent, has its greatest length\r\nfrom east to west, and is girt round by mountains. Its walled-town\r\nconnects with one of these, rather a low one known as Shāh-of-Kābul\r\nbecause at some time a (Hindū) Shāh of Kābul built a residence on its\r\nsummit.[723] Shāh-of-Kābul begins at the Dūrrīn narrows and ends at\r\nthose of Dih-i-yaq`ūb[724]; it may be 4 miles (2 _shar`ī_) round; its\r\nskirt is covered with gardens fertilized from a canal which was brought\r\nalong the hill-slope in the time of my paternal uncle, Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā\r\nby his guardian, Wais Atāka.[725] The water of this canal comes to an\r\nend in a retired corner, a quarter known as Kul-kīna[726] where much\r\ndebauchery has gone on. About this place it [Sidenote: Fol. 128b.]\r\nsometimes used to be said, in jesting parody of Khwāja Ḥāfiẓ[727],—\"Ah!\r\nthe happy, thoughtless time when, with our names in ill-repute, we lived\r\ndays of days at Kul-kīna!\"\r\n\r\nEast of Shāh-of-Kabūl and south of the walled-town lies a large\r\npool[728] about a 2 miles [_shar`ī_] round. From the town side of the\r\nmountain three smallish springs issue, two near Kul-kīna; Khwāja\r\nShamū's[729] tomb is at the head of one; Khwāja Khiẓr's Qadam-gāh[730]\r\nat the head of another, and the third is at a place known as Khwāja\r\nRaushānāī, over against Khwāja `Abdu'ṣ-ṣamad. On a detached rock of a\r\nspur of Shāh-of-Kābul, known as `Uqābain,[731] stands the citadel of\r\nKābul with the great walled-town at its north end, lying high in\r\nexcellent air, and overlooking the large pool already mentioned, and\r\nalso three meadows, namely, Siyāh-sang (Black-rock), Sūng-qūrghān\r\n(Fort-back), and Chālāk (Highwayman?),—a most beautiful outlook when the\r\nmeadows are green. The north-wind does not fail Kābul in the heats;\r\npeople call it the Parwān-wind[732]; it makes a delightful temperature\r\nin the windowed houses on the northern part of the citadel. In praise of\r\nthe citadel of Kābul, Mullā Muḥammad _T̤ālib Mu`ammāī_ (the\r\nRiddler)[733]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 129.] used to recite this couplet, composed on\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's name:—\r\n\r\n   Drink wine in the castle of Kābul and send the cup round\r\n     without pause;\r\n   For Kābul is mountain, is river, is city, is lowland in one.[734]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Kābul as a trading-town._)\r\n\r\nJust as `Arabs call every place outside `Arab (Arabia), `Ajam, so\r\nHindūstānīs call every place outside Hindūstān, Khurāsān. There are two\r\ntrade-marts on the land-route between Hindūstān and Khurāsān; one is\r\nKābul, the other, Qandahār. To Kābul caravans come from Kāshghar,[735]\r\nFarghāna,Turkistān, Samarkand, Bukhārā, Balkh, Ḥiṣār and Badakhshān. To\r\nQandahār they come from Khurāsān. Kābul is an excellent trading-centre;\r\nif merchants went to Khīta or to Rūm,[736] they might make no higher\r\nprofit. Down to Kābul every year come 7, 8, or 10,000 horses and up to\r\nit, from Hindūstān, come every year caravans of 10, 15 or 20,000\r\nheads-of-houses, bringing slaves (_barda_), white cloth, sugar-candy,\r\nrefined and common sugars, and aromatic roots. Many a trader is not\r\ncontent with a profit of 30 or 40 on 10.[737] In Kābul can be had the\r\nproducts of Khurāsān, Rūm, `Irāq and Chīn (China); while it is\r\nHindūstān's own market.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Products and climate of Kābul._)\r\n\r\nIn the country of Kābul, there are hot and cold districts close to one\r\nanother. In one day, a man may go out of the town of Kābul to where snow\r\nnever falls, or he may go, in two sidereal [Sidenote: Fol. 129b.] hours,\r\nto where it never thaws, unless when the heats are such that it cannot\r\npossibly lie.\r\n\r\nFruits of hot and cold climates are to be had in the districts near the\r\ntown. Amongst those of the cold climate, there are had in the town the\r\ngrape, pomegranate, apricot, apple, quince, pear, peach, plum,\r\n_sinjid_, almond and walnut.[738] I had cuttings of the _ālū-bālū_[739]\r\nbrought there and planted; they grew and have done well. Of fruits of\r\nthe hot climate people bring into the town;—from the Lamghānāt, the\r\norange, citron, _amlūk_ (_diospyrus lotus_), and sugar-cane; this last I\r\nhad had brought and planted there;[740]—from Nijr-au (Nijr-water), they\r\nbring the _jīl-ghūza,[741] and, from the hill-tracts, much honey.\r\nBee-hives are in use; it_ is only from towards Ghaznī, that no honey\r\ncomes.\r\n\r\nThe rhubarb[742] of the Kābul district is good, its quinces and plums\r\nvery good, so too its _badrang_;[743] it grows an excellent grape, known\r\nas the water-grape.[744] Kābul wines are heady, those of the Khwāja\r\nKhāwand Sa`īd hill-skirt being famous for their strength; at this time\r\nhowever I can only repeat the praise of others about them:—[745]\r\n\r\n   The flavour of the wine a drinker knows;\r\n   What chance have sober men to know it?\r\n\r\nKābul is not fertile in grain, a four or five-fold return is reckoned\r\ngood there; nor are its melons first-rate, but they are not altogether\r\nbad when grown from Khurāsān seed.\r\n\r\nIt has a very pleasant climate; if the world has another so pleasant, it\r\nis not known. Even in the heats, one cannot sleep at night without a\r\nfur-coat.[746] Although the snow in most places lies deep in winter, the\r\ncold is not excessive; whereas in [Sidenote: Fol. 130.] Samarkand and\r\nTabrīz, both, like Kābul, noted for their pleasant climate, the cold is\r\nextreme.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Meadows of Kābul._)\r\n\r\nThere are good meadows on the four sides of Kābul. An excellent one,\r\nSūng-qūrghān, is some 4 miles (2 _kuroh_) to the north-east; it has\r\ngrass fit for horses and few mosquitos. To the north-west is the Chālāk\r\nmeadow, some 2 miles (1 _shar`ī_) away, a large one but in it mosquitos\r\ngreatly trouble the horses. On the west is the Dūrrīn, in fact there are\r\ntwo, Tīpa and Qūsh-nādir (var. nāwar),—if two are counted here, there\r\nwould be five in all. Each of these is about 2 miles from the town; both\r\nare small, have grass good for horses, and no mosquitos; Kābul has no\r\nothers so good. On the east is the Siyāh-sang meadow with Qūtlūq-qadam's\r\ntomb[747] between it and the Currier's-gate; it is not worth much\r\nbecause, in the heats, it swarms with mosquitos. Kamarī[748] meadow\r\nadjoins it; counting this in, the meadows of Kābul would be six, but\r\nthey are always spoken of as four.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Mountain-passes into Kābul._)\r\n\r\nThe country of Kābul is a fastness hard for a foreign foe to make his\r\nway into.\r\n\r\nThe Hindū-kush mountains, which separate Kābul from Balkh, Qūndūz and\r\nBadakhshān, are crossed by seven roads.[749] Three of these lead out of\r\nPanjhīr (Panj-sher), _viz._ Khawāk, the uppermost, T̤ūl, the next lower,\r\nand Bāzārak.[750] Of the passes on them, the one on the T̤ūl road is the\r\nbest, but the road itself is rather [Sidenote: Fol. 130b.] the longest\r\nwhence, seemingly, it is called T̤ūl. Bāzārak is the most direct; like\r\nT̤ūl, it leads over into Sar-i-āb; as it passes through Pārandī, local\r\npeople call its main pass, the Pārandī. Another road leads up\r\nthrough Parwān; it has seven minor passes, known as Haft-bacha\r\n(Seven-younglings), between Parwān and its main pass (Bāj-gāh). It is\r\njoined at its main pass by two roads from Andar-āb, which go on to\r\nParwān by it. This is a road full of difficulties. Out of Ghūr-bund,\r\nagain, three roads lead over. The one next to Parwān, known as the\r\nYāngī-yūl pass (New-road), goes through Wālīān to Khinjan; next above\r\nthis is the Qīpchāq road, crossing to where the water of Andar-āb meets\r\nthe Sūrkh-āb (Qīzīl-sū); this also is an excellent road; and the third\r\nleads over the Shibr-tū pass;[751] those crossing by this in the heats\r\ntake their way by Bāmīān and Saighān, but those crossing by it in\r\nwinter, go on by Āb-dara (Water-valley).[752] Shibr-tū excepted, all the\r\nHindū-kush roads are closed for three or four months in winter,[753]\r\nbecause no road through a valley-bottom is passable when the waters are\r\nhigh. If any-one thinks to cross the Hindū-kush at that time, over the\r\nmountains instead of through a valley-bottom, his journey is hard\r\nindeed. The time to cross is during the three or four autumn months when\r\nthe snow is less and the waters are low. [Sidenote: Fol. 131.] Whether\r\non the mountains or in the valley-bottoms, Kāfir highwaymen are not few.\r\n\r\nThe road from Kābul into Khurāsān passes through Qandahār; it is quite\r\nlevel, without a pass.\r\n\r\nFour roads lead into Kābul from the Hindūstān side; one by rather a low\r\npass through the Khaibar mountains, another by way of Bangash, another\r\nby way of Naghr (var. Naghz),[754] and another through Farmūl;[755] the\r\npasses being low also in the three last-named. These roads are all\r\nreached from three ferries over the Sind. Those who take the Nīl-āb[756]\r\nferry, come on through the Lamghānāt.[757] In winter, however, people\r\nford the Sind-water (at Hāru) above its junction with the\r\nKābul-water,[758] and ford this also. In most of my expeditions into\r\nHindūstān, I crossed those fords, but this last time (932 AH.-1525 AD.),\r\nwhen I came, defeated Sl. Ibrāhīm and conquered the country, I crossed\r\nby boat at Nīl-āb. Except at the one place mentioned above, the\r\nSind-water can be crossed only by boat. Those again, who cross at\r\nDīn-kot[759] go on through Bangash. Those crossing at Chaupāra, if they\r\ntake the Farmūl road, go on to Ghaznī, or, if they go by the Dasht, go\r\non to Qandahār.[760]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Inhabitants of Kābul._)\r\n\r\nThere are many differing tribes in the Kābul country; in its dales and\r\nplains are Turks and clansmen[761] and `Arabs; in its town and in many\r\nvillages, Sārts; out in the districts and also [Sidenote: Fol. 131b.] in\r\nvillages are the Pashāī, Parājī, Tājīk, Bīrkī and Afghān tribes. In the\r\nwestern mountains are the Hazāra and Nikdīrī tribes, some of whom speak\r\nthe Mughūlī tongue. In the north-eastern mountains are the places of the\r\nKāfirs, such as Kitūr (Gawār?) and Gibrik. To the south are the places\r\nof the Afghān tribes.\r\n\r\nEleven or twelve tongues are spoken in Kābul,—`Arabī, Persian, Turkī,\r\nMughūlī, Hindī, Afghānī, Pashāī, Parājī, Gibrī, Bīrkī and Lamghānī. If\r\nthere be another country with so many differing tribes and such a\r\ndiversity of tongues, it is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Sub-divisions of the Kābul country._)\r\n\r\nThe [Kābul] country has fourteen _tūmāns_.[762]\r\n\r\nBajaur, Sawād and Hash-nagar may at one time have been dependencies of\r\nKābul, but they now have no resemblance to cultivated countries\r\n(_wilāyāt_), some lying desolate because of the Afghāns, others being\r\nnow subject to them.\r\n\r\nIn the east of the country of Kābul is the Lamghānāt, 5 _tūmāns_ and 2\r\n_bulūks_ of cultivated lands.[763] The largest of these is Nīngnahār,\r\nsometimes written Nagarahār in the histories.[764] Its _dārogha's_\r\nresidence is in Adīnapūr,[765] some 13 _yīghāch_ east of Kābul by a very\r\nbad and tiresome road, going in three or four places over small\r\nhill-passes, and in three or four others, through [Sidenote: Fol. 132.]\r\nnarrows.[766] So long as there was no cultivation along it, the\r\nKhirilchī and other Afghān thieves used to make it their beat, but it\r\nhas become safe[767] since I had it peopled at Qarā-tū,[768] below\r\nQūrūq-sāī. The hot and cold climates are separated on this road by the\r\npass of Bādām-chashma (Almond-spring); on its Kābul side snow falls,\r\nnone at Qūrūq-sāī, towards the Lamghānāt.[769] After descending this\r\npass, another world comes into view, other trees, other plants (or\r\ngrasses), other animals, and other manners and customs of men. Nīngnahār\r\nis nine torrents (_tūqūz-rūd_).[770] It grows good crops of rice and\r\ncorn, excellent and abundant oranges, citrons and pomegranates. In 914\r\nAH. (1508-9 AD.) I laid out the Four-gardens, known as the Bāgh-i-wafā\r\n(Garden-of-fidelity), on a rising-ground, facing south and having the\r\nSūrkh-rūd between it and Fort Adīnapūr.[771] There oranges, citrons and\r\npomegranates grow in abundance. The year I defeated Pahār Khān and took\r\nLāhor and Dipālpūr,[772] I had plantains (bananas) brought and planted\r\nthere; they did very well. The year before I had had sugar-cane planted\r\nthere; it also did well; some of it was sent to Bukhārā and\r\nBadakhshān.[773] The garden lies high, has running-water close at hand,\r\nand a mild winter [Sidenote: Fol. 132b.] climate. In the middle of it, a\r\none-mill stream flows constantly past the little hill on which are the\r\nfour garden-plots. In the south-west part of it there is a reservoir, 10\r\nby 10,[774] round which are orange-trees and a few pomegranates, the\r\nwhole encircled by a trefoil-meadow. This is the best part of the\r\ngarden, a most beautiful sight when the oranges take colour. Truly that\r\ngarden is admirably situated!\r\n\r\nThe Safed-koh runs along the south of Nīngnahār, dividing it from\r\nBangash; no riding-road crosses it; nine torrents (_tūqūz-rūd_) issue\r\nfrom it.[775] It is called Safed-koh[776] because its snow never\r\nlessens; none falls in the lower parts of its valleys, a half-day's\r\njourney from the snow-line. Many places along it have an excellent\r\nclimate; its waters are cold and need no ice.\r\n\r\nThe Sūrkh-rūd flows along the south of Adīnapūr. The fort stands on a\r\nheight having a straight fall to the river of some 130 ft. (40-50\r\n_qārī_) and isolated from the mountain behind it on the north; it is\r\nvery strongly placed. That mountain runs between Nīngnahār and\r\nLamghān[777]; on its head snow falls when it snows [Sidenote: Fol. 133.]\r\nin Kābul, so Lamghānīs know when it has snowed in the town.\r\n\r\nIn going from Kābul into the Lamghānāt,[778]—if people come by\r\nQūrūq-sāī, one road goes on through the Dīrī-pass, crosses the\r\nBārān-water at Būlān, and so on into the Lamghānāt,—another goes through\r\nQarā-tū, below Qūrūq-sāī, crosses the Bārān-water at Aūlūgh-nūr\r\n(Great-rock?), and goes into Lamghān by the pass of Bād-i-pīch.[779] If\r\nhowever people come by Nijr-aū, they traverse Badr-aū (Tag-aū), and\r\nQarā-nakariq (?), and go on through the pass of Bād-i-pīch.\r\n\r\nAlthough Nīngnahār is one of the five _tūmāns_ of the Lamghān _tūmān_\r\nthe name Lamghānāt applies strictly only to the three (mentioned below).\r\n\r\nOne of the three is the `Alī-shang _tūmān_, to the north of which are\r\nfastness-mountains, connecting with Hindū-kush and inhabited by Kāfirs\r\nonly. What of Kāfiristān lies nearest to `Alī-shang, is Mīl out of which\r\nits torrent issues. The tomb of Lord Lām,[780] father of his Reverence\r\nthe prophet Nuḥ (Noah), is in this _tūmān_. In some histories he is\r\ncalled Lamak and Lamakān. Some people are observed often to change _kāf_\r\nfor _ghain_ (_k_ for _gh_); it would seem to be on this account that the\r\ncountry is called Lamghān.\r\n\r\nThe second is Alangār. The part of Kāfiristān nearest to it is Gawār\r\n(Kawār), out of which its torrent issues (the Gau or Kau). This torrent\r\njoins that of `Alī-shang and flows with it [Sidenote: Fol. 133b.] into\r\nthe Bārān-water, below Mandrāwar, which is the third _tūmān_ of the\r\nLamghānāt.\r\n\r\nOf the two _bulūks_ of Lamghān one is the Nūr-valley.[781] This is a\r\nplace (_yīr_) without a second[782]; its fort is on a beak (_tūmshūq_)\r\nof rock in the mouth of the valley, and has a torrent on each side; its\r\nrice is grown on steep terraces, and it can be traversed by one road\r\nonly.[783] It has the orange, citron and other fruits of hot climates in\r\nabundance, a few dates even. Trees cover the banks of both the torrents\r\nbelow the fort; many are _amlūk_, the fruit of which some Turks call\r\n_qarā-yīmīsh_;[784] here they are many, but none have been seen\r\nelsewhere. The valley grows grapes also, all trained on trees.[785] Its\r\nwines are those of Lamghān that have reputation. Two sorts of grapes are\r\ngrown, the _arah-tāshī_ and the _sūhān-tāshī_;[786] the first are\r\nyellowish, the second, full-red of fine colour. The first make the more\r\ncheering wine, but it must be said that neither wine equals its\r\nreputation for cheer. High up in one of its glens, apes (_maimūn_) are\r\nfound, none below. Those people (_i.e._ Nūrīs) used to keep swine but\r\nthey have given it up in our time.[787]\r\n\r\nAnother _tūmān_ of Lamghān is Kūnār-with-Nūr-gal. It lies somewhat\r\nout-of-the-way, remote from the Lamghānāt, with its borders in amongst\r\nthe Kāfir lands; on these accounts its people give in tribute rather\r\nlittle of what they have. The Chaghān-sarāī [Sidenote: Fol. 134.] water\r\nenters it from the north-east, passes on into the _bulūk_ of Kāma, there\r\njoins the Bārān-water and with that flows east.\r\n\r\nMīr Sayyid `Alī _Hamadānī_,[788]—God's mercy on him!—coming here as he\r\njourneyed, died 2 miles (1 _shar`ī_) above Kūnār. His disciples carried\r\nhis body to Khutlān. A shrine was erected at the honoured place of his\r\ndeath, of which I made the circuit when I came and took Chaghān-sarāī in\r\n920 AH.[789]\r\n\r\nThe orange, citron and coriander[790] abound in this _tūmān_. Strong\r\nwines are brought down into it from Kāfiristān.\r\n\r\nA strange thing is told there, one seeming impossible, but one told to\r\nus again and again. All through the hill-country above Multa-kundī,\r\n_viz._ in Kūnār, Nūr-gal, Bajaur, Sawād and thereabouts, it is commonly\r\nsaid that when a woman dies and has been laid on a bier, she, if she has\r\nnot been an ill-doer, gives the bearers such a shake when they lift the\r\nbier by its four sides, that against their will and hindrance, her\r\ncorpse falls to the ground; but, if she has done ill, no movement\r\noccurs. This was heard not only from Kūnārīs but, again and again, in\r\nBajaur, [Sidenote: Fol. 134b.] Sawād and the whole hill-tract.\r\nḤaidar-`alī _Bajaurī_,—a sulṯān who governed Bajaur well,—when his\r\nmother died, did not weep, or betake himself to lamentation, or put on\r\nblack, but said, \"Go! lay her on the bier! if she move not, I will have\r\nher burned.\"[792] They laid her on the bier; the desired movement\r\nfollowed; when he heard that this was so, he put on black and betook\r\nhimself to lamentation.\r\n\r\n   (_Authors note to Multa-kundī._) As Multa-kundī is known the\r\n   lower part of the _tūmān_ of Kūnār-with-Nūr-gal; what is below\r\n   (_i.e._ on the river) belongs to the valley of Nūr and to\r\n   Atar.[791]\r\n\r\nAnother _bulūk_ is Chaghān-sarāī,[793] a single village with little\r\nland, in the mouth of Kāfiristān; its people, though Muṣalmān, mix with\r\nthe Kāfirs and, consequently, follow their customs.[794] A great torrent\r\n(the Kūnār) comes down to it from the north-east from behind Bajaur, and\r\na smaller one, called Pīch, comes down out of Kāfiristān. Strong\r\nyellowish wines are had there, not in any way resembling those of the\r\nNūr-valley, however. The village has no grapes or vineyards of its own;\r\nits wines are all brought from up the Kāfiristān-water and from\r\nPīch-i-kāfiristānī.\r\n\r\nThe Pīch Kāfirs came to help the villagers when I took the place. Wine\r\nis so commonly used there that every Kāfir has his leathern wine-bag\r\n(_khīg_) at his neck, and drinks wine instead of water.[795]\r\n\r\nKāma, again, though not a separate district but dependent on Nīngnahār,\r\nis also called a _bulūk_.[796] [Sidenote: Fol. 135.]\r\n\r\nNijr-aū[797] is another _tūmān_. It lies north of Kābul, in the\r\nKohistān, with mountains behind it inhabited solely by Kāfirs; it is a\r\nquite sequestered place. It grows grapes and fruits in abundance. Its\r\npeople make much wine but, they boil it. They fatten many fowls in\r\nwinter, are wine-bibbers, do not pray, have no scruples and are\r\nKāfir-like.[798]\r\n\r\nIn the Nijr-aū mountains is an abundance of _archa_, _jīlghūza_, _bīlūt_\r\nand _khanjak_.[799] The first-named three do not grow above Nigr-aū but\r\nthey grow lower, and are amongst the trees of Hindūstān. _Jīlghūza_-wood\r\nis all the lamp the people have; it burns like a candle and is very\r\nremarkable. The flying-squirrel[800] is found in these mountains, an\r\nanimal larger than a bat and having a curtain (_parda_), like a bat's\r\nwing, between its arms and legs. People often brought one in; it is said\r\nto fly, downward from one tree to another, as far as a _giz_ flies;[801]\r\nI myself have never seen one fly. Once we put one to a tree; it\r\nclambered up directly and got away, but, when people went after it, it\r\nspread its wings and came down, without hurt, as if it had flown.\r\nAnother of the curiosities of the Nijr-aū mountains is the _lūkha_\r\n(var. _lūja_) bird, called also _bū-qalamūn_ (chameleon) because,\r\nbetween head and tail, it has four or five changing colours,\r\nresplendent like a pigeon's throat.[802] It is about as large as the\r\n_kabg-i-darī_ and seems to be the _kabg-i-darī_ of Hindūstān.[803]\r\nPeople tell this wonderful thing about it:—When the birds, at [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 135b.] the on-set of winter, descend to the hill-skirts, if they\r\ncome over a vineyard, they can fly no further and are taken.[804] There\r\nis a kind of rat in Nijr-aū, known as the musk-rat, which smells of\r\nmusk; I however have never seen it.[805]\r\n\r\nPanjhīr (Panj-sher) is another _tūmān_; it lies close to Kāfiristān,\r\nalong the Panjhīr road, and is the thoroughfare of Kāfir highwaymen who\r\nalso, being so near, take tax of it. They have gone through it, killing\r\na mass of persons, and doing very evil deeds, since I came this last\r\ntime and conquered Hindūstān (932 AH.-1526 AD.).[806]\r\n\r\nAnother is the _tūmān_ of Ghūr-bund. In those countries they call a\r\n_kūtal_ (_koh_?) a _bund_;[807] they go towards Ghūr by this pass\r\n(_kūtal_); apparently it is for this reason that they have called (the\r\n_tūmān_?) Ghūr-bund. The Hazāra hold the heads of its valleys.[808] It\r\nhas few villages and little revenue can be raised from it. There are\r\nsaid to be mines of silver and lapis lazuli in its mountains.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are the villages on the skirts of the (Hindū-kush)\r\nmountains,[809] with Mīta-kacha and Parwān at their head, and\r\nDūr-nāma[810] at their foot, 12 or 13 in all. They are fruit-bearing\r\nvillages, and they grow cheering wines, those of Khwāja Khāwand Sa`īd\r\nbeing reputed the strongest roundabouts. The villages all lie on the\r\nfoot-hills; some pay taxes but not all are taxable because they lie so\r\nfar back in the mountains.\r\n\r\nBetween the foot-hills and the Bārān-water are two detached stretches of\r\nlevel land, one known as _Kurrat-tāziyān_,[811] the other as\r\n_Dasht-i-shaikh_ (Shaikh's-plain). As the green grass of the millet[812]\r\ngrows well there, they are the resort of Turks and [Sidenote: Fol. 136.]\r\n(Mughūl) clans (_aīmāq_).\r\n\r\nTulips of many colours cover these foot-hills; I once counted them up;\r\nit came out at 32 or 33 different sorts. We named one the Rose-scented,\r\nbecause its perfume was a little like that of the red rose; it grows by\r\nitself on Shaikh's-plain, here and nowhere else. The Hundred-leaved\r\ntulip is another; this grows, also by itself, at the outlet of the\r\nGhūr-bund narrows, on the hill-skirt below Parwān. A low hill known as\r\nKhwāja Reg-i-rawān (Khwāja-of-the-running-sand), divides the afore-named\r\ntwo pieces of level land; it has, from top to foot, a strip of sand from\r\nwhich people say the sound of nagarets and tambours issues in the\r\nheats.[813]\r\n\r\nAgain, there are the villages depending on Kābul itself. South-west from\r\nthe town are great snow mountains[814] where snow falls on snow, and\r\nwhere few may be the years when, falling, it does not light on last\r\nyear's snow. It is fetched, 12 miles may-be, from these mountains, to\r\ncool the drinking water when ice-houses in Kābul are empty. Like the\r\nBāmiān mountains, these are fastnesses. Out of them issue the Harmand\r\n(Halmand), Sind, Dūghāba of Qūndūz, and Balkh-āb,[815] so that in a\r\nsingle day, a man might drink of the water of each of these four rivers.\r\n\r\nIt is on the skirt of one of these ranges (Pamghān) that most of the\r\nvillages dependent on Kābul lie.[816] Masses of grapes ripen in their\r\nvineyards and they grow every sort of fruit in abundance. No-one of them\r\nequals Istālīf or Astar-ghach; these must be the [Sidenote: Fol. 136b.]\r\ntwo which Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā used to call his Khurāsān and Samarkand.\r\nPamghān is another of the best, not ranking in fruit and grapes with\r\nthose two others, but beyond comparison with them in climate. The\r\nPamghān mountains are a snowy range. Few villages match Istālīf, with\r\nvineyards and fine orchards on both sides of its great torrent, with\r\nwaters needing no ice, cold and, mostly, pure. Of its Great garden\r\nAūlūgh Beg Mīrzā had taken forcible possession; I took it over, after\r\npaying its price to the owners. There is a pleasant halting-place\r\noutside it, under great planes, green, shady and beautiful. A one-mill\r\nstream, having trees on both banks, flows constantly through the middle\r\nof the garden; formerly its course was zig-zag and irregular; I had it\r\nmade straight and orderly; so the place became very beautiful. Between\r\nthe village and the valley-bottom, from 4 to 6 miles down the slope, is\r\na spring, known as Khwāja Sih-yārān (Three-friends), round which three\r\nsorts of tree grow. A group of planes gives pleasant shade above it;\r\nholm-oak [Sidenote: Fol. 137.] (_quercus bīlūt_) grows in masses on the\r\nslope at its sides,—these two oaklands (_bīlūtistān_) excepted, no\r\nholm-oak grows in the mountains of western Kābul,—and the Judas-tree\r\n(_arghwān_)[817] is much cultivated in front of it, that is towards the\r\nlevel ground,—cultivated there and nowhere else. People say the three\r\ndifferent sorts of tree were a gift made by three saints,[818] whence\r\nits name. I ordered that the spring should be enclosed in mortared\r\nstone-work, 10 by 10, and that a symmetrical, right-angled platform\r\nshould be built on each of its sides, so as to overlook the whole field\r\nof Judas-trees. If, the world over, there is a place to match this when\r\nthe _arghwāns_ are in full bloom, I do not know it. The yellow _arghwān_\r\ngrows plentifully there also, the red and the yellow flowering at the\r\nsame time.[819]\r\n\r\nIn order to bring water to a large round seat which I had built on the\r\nhillside and planted round with willows, I had a channel dug across the\r\nslope from a half-mill stream, constantly flowing in a valley to the\r\nsouth-west of Sih-yārān. The date of cutting this channel was found in\r\n_jūī-khūsh_ (kindly channel).[820]\r\n\r\nAnother of the _tūmāns_ of Kābul is Luhūgur (mod. Logar). Its one large\r\nvillage is Chīrkh from which were his Reverence Maulānā Ya`qūb and\r\nMullā-zāda `Us̤mān.[821] Khwāja Aḥmad [Sidenote: Fol. 137b.] and Khwāja\r\nYūnas were from Sajāwand, another of its villages. Chīrkh has many\r\ngardens, but there are none in any other village of Luhūgur. Its people\r\nare Aūghān-shāl, a term common in Kābul, seeming to be a\r\nmispronouncement of Aūghān-sha`ār.[822]\r\n\r\nAgain, there is the _wilāyat_, or, as some say, _tūmān_ of Ghaznī, said\r\nto have been[823] the capital of Sabuk-tīgīn, Sl. Maḥmūd and their\r\ndescendants. Many write it Ghaznīn. It is said also to have been the\r\nseat of government of Shihābu'd-dīn _Ghūrī_,[824] styled Mu`iz̤z̤u'd-dīn\r\nin the _T̤abaqāt-i-nāṣirī_ and also some of the histories of Hind.\r\n\r\nGhaznī is known also as _Zābulistān_; it belongs to the Third climate.\r\nSome hold that Qandahār is a part of it. It lies 14 _yīghāch_ (south-)\r\nwest of Kābul; those leaving it at dawn, may reach Kābul between the Two\r\nPrayers (_i.e._ in the afternoon); whereas the 13 _yīghāch_ between\r\nAdīnapūr and Kābul can never be done in one day, because of the\r\ndifficulties of the road.\r\n\r\nGhaznī has little cultivated land. Its torrent, a four-mill or five-mill\r\nstream may-be, makes the town habitable and fertilizes four or five\r\nvillages; three or four others are cultivated from under-ground\r\nwater-courses (_kārez_). Ghaznī grapes are better than those of Kābul;\r\nits melons are more abundant; its apples [Sidenote: Fol. 138.] are very\r\ngood, and are carried to Hindūstān. Agriculture is very laborious in\r\nGhaznī because, whatever the quality of the soil, it must be newly\r\ntop-dressed every year; it gives a better return, however, than Kābul.\r\nGhaznī grows madder; the entire crop goes to Hindūstān and yields\r\nexcellent profit to the growers. In the open-country of Ghaznī dwell\r\nHazāra and Afghāns. Compared with Kābul, it is always a cheap place. Its\r\npeople hold to the Ḥanafī faith, are good, orthodox Muṣalmāns, many keep\r\na three months' fast,[825] and their wives and children live modestly\r\nsecluded.\r\n\r\nOne of the eminent men of Ghaznī was Mullā `Abdu'r-raḥmān, a learned man\r\nand always a learner (_dars_), a most orthodox, pious and virtuous\r\nperson; he left this world the same year as Nāṣir Mīrzā (921 AH.-1515\r\nAD.). Sl. Maḥmūd's tomb is in the suburb called Rauẓa,[826] from which\r\nthe best grapes come; there also are the tombs of his descendants, Sl.\r\nMas`ūd and Sl. Ibrāhīm. Ghaznī has many blessed tombs. The year[827] I\r\ntook Kābul and Ghaznī, over-ran Kohāt, the plain of Bannū and lands of\r\nthe Afghāns, and went on to Ghaznī by way of Dūkī (Dūgī) and Āb-istāda,\r\npeople told me there was a tomb, in a village of Ghaznī, which moved\r\nwhen a benediction on the Prophet was [Sidenote: Fol. 138b.] pronounced\r\nover it. We went to see it. In the end I discovered that the movement\r\nwas a trick, presumably of the servants at the tomb, who had put a sort\r\nof platform above it which moved when pushed, so that, to those on it,\r\nthe tomb seemed to move, just as the shore does to those passing in a\r\nboat. I ordered the scaffold destroyed and a dome built over the tomb;\r\nalso I forbad the servants, with threats, ever to bring about the\r\nmovement again.\r\n\r\nGhaznī is a very humble place; strange indeed it is that rulers in whose\r\nhands were Hindūstān and Khurāsānāt,[828] should have chosen it for\r\ntheir capital. In the Sulṯān's (Maḥmūd's) time there may have been three\r\nor four dams in the country; one he made, some three _yīghāch_ (18 m.?)\r\nup the Ghaznī-water to the north; it was about 40-50 _qārī_ (yards) high\r\nand some 300 long; through it the stored waters were let out as\r\nrequired.[829] It was destroyed by `Alāu'u'd-dīn _Jahān-soz Ghūrī_ when\r\nhe conquered the country (550 AH.-1152 AD.), burned and ruined the tombs\r\nof several descendants of Sl. Maḥmūd, sacked and burned the town, in\r\nshort, left undone no tittle of murder and rapine. Since [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n139.] that time, the Sulṯān's dam has lain in ruins, but, through God's\r\nfavour, there is hope that it may become of use again, by means of the\r\nmoney which was sent, in Khwāja Kalān's hand, in the year Hindūstān was\r\nconquered (932 AH.-1526 AD.).[830] The Sakhandam is another, 2 or 3\r\n_yīghāch_ (12-18 m.), may-be, on the east of the town; it has long been\r\nin ruins, indeed is past repair. There is a dam in working order at\r\nSar-i-dih (Village-head).\r\n\r\nIn books it is written that there is in Ghaznī a spring such that, if\r\ndirt and foul matter be thrown into it, a tempest gets up instantly,\r\nwith a blizzard of rain and wind. It has been seen said also in one of\r\nthe histories that Sabuk-tīgīn, when besieged by the Rāī (Jāī-pāl) of\r\nHind, ordered dirt and foulness to be thrown into the spring, by this\r\naroused, in an instant, a tempest with blizzard of rain and snow, and,\r\nby this device, drove off his foe.[831] Though we made many enquiries,\r\nno intimation of the spring's existence was given us.\r\n\r\nIn these countries Ghaznī and Khwārizm are noted for cold, in the same\r\nway that Sulṯānīā and Tabrīz are in the two `Irāqs and Aẕarbāījān.\r\n\r\nZurmut is another _tūmān_, some 12-13 _yīghāch_ south of Kābul and 7-8\r\nsouth-east of Ghaznī.[832] Its _dārogha's_ head-quarters are [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 139b.] in Gīrdīz; there most houses are three or four storeys high.\r\nIt does not want for strength, and gave Nāṣir Mīrzā trouble when it went\r\ninto hostility to him. Its people are Aūghān-shāl; they grow corn but\r\nhave neither vineyards nor orchards. The tomb of Shaikh Muḥammad\r\n_Muṣalmān_ is at a spring, high on the skirt of a mountain, known as\r\nBarakistān, in the south of the _tūmān_.\r\n\r\nFarmūl is another _tūmān_,[833] a humble place, growing not bad apples\r\nwhich are carried into Hindūstān. Of Farmūl were the Shaikh-zādas,\r\ndescendants of Shaikh Muḥammad _Muṣalmān_, who were so much in favour\r\nduring the Afghān period in Hindūstān.\r\n\r\nBangash is another _tūmān_.[834] All round about it are Afghān\r\nhighwaymen, such as the Khūgīānī, Khirilchī, Tūrī and Landar. Lying\r\nout-of-the-way, as it does, its people do not pay taxes willingly. There\r\nhas been no time to bring it to obedience; greater tasks have fallen to\r\nme,—the conquests of Qandahār, Balkh, Badakhshān and Hindūstān! But, God\r\nwilling! when I get the chance, I most assuredly will take order with\r\nthose Bangash thieves.\r\n\r\nOne of the _bulūks_ of Kābul is Ālā-sāī,[835] 4 to 6 miles (2-3\r\n_shar`ī_) east of Nijr-aū. The direct road into it from Nijr-aū leads,\r\nat a place called Kūra, through the quite small pass which in that\r\nlocality separates the hot and cold climates. Through this pass the\r\nbirds migrate at the change of the seasons, and at those times many are\r\ntaken by the people of Pīchghān, one of the dependencies of Nijr-aū, in\r\nthe following manner:—From [Sidenote: Fol. 140.] distance to distance\r\nnear the mouth of the pass, they make hiding-places for the\r\nbird-catchers. They fasten one corner of a net five or six yards away,\r\nand weight the lower side to the ground with stones. Along the other\r\nside of the net, for half its width, they fasten a stick some 3 to 4\r\nyards long. The hidden bird-catcher holds this stick and by it, when the\r\nbirds approach, lifts up the net to its full height. The birds then go\r\ninto the net of themselves. Sometimes so many are taken by this\r\ncontrivance that there is not time to cut their throats.[836]\r\n\r\nThough the Ālā-sāī pomegranates are not first-rate, they have local\r\nreputation because none are better there-abouts; they are carried into\r\nHindūstān. Grapes also do not grow badly, and the wines of Ālā-sāī are\r\nbetter and stronger than those of Nijr-aū.\r\n\r\nBadr-aū (Tag-aū) is another _bulūk_; it runs with Ālā-sāī, grows no\r\nfruit, and for cultivators has corn-growing Kāfirs.[837]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Tribesmen of Kābul._)\r\n\r\nJust as Turks and (Mughūl) clans (_aīmāq_) dwell in the open country of\r\nKhurāsān and Samarkand, so in Kābul do the Hazāra and Afghāns. Of the\r\nHazāra, the most widely-scattered are the Sulṯān-mas`ūdi Hazāra, of\r\nAfghāns, the Mahmand.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Revenue of Kābul._)\r\n\r\nThe revenues of Kābul, whether from the cultivated lands or from tolls\r\n(_tamghā_) or from dwellers in the open country, amount to 8 _laks_ of\r\n_shāhrukhīs_.[838] [Sidenote: Fol. 140b.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. The mountain-tracts of Kābul._)\r\n\r\nWhere the mountains of Andar-āb, Khwāst,[839] and the Badakh-shānāt have\r\nconifers (_archa_), many springs and gentle slopes, those of eastern\r\nKābul have grass (_aūt_), grass like a beautiful floor, on hill, slope\r\nand dale. For the most part it is _būta-kāh_ grass (_aūt_), very\r\nsuitable for horses. In the Andijān country they talk of _būta-kāh_, but\r\nwhy they do so was not known (to me?); in Kābul it was heard-say to be\r\nbecause the grass comes up in tufts (_būta, būta_).[840] The alps of\r\nthese mountains are like those of Ḥiṣār, Khutlān, Farghāna, Samarkand\r\nand Mughūlistān,—all these being alike in mountain and alp, though the\r\nalps of Farghāna and Mughūlistān are beyond comparison with the rest.\r\n\r\nFrom all these the mountains of Nijr-aū, the Lamghānāt and Sawād differ\r\nin having masses of cypresses,[841] holm-oak, olive and mastic\r\n(_khanjak_); their grass also is different,—it is dense, it is tall, it\r\nis good neither for horse nor sheep. Although these mountains are not so\r\nhigh as those already described, indeed they look to be low,\r\nnone-the-less, they are strongholds; what to the eye is even slope,\r\nreally is hard rock on which it is impossible to ride. Many of the\r\nbeasts and birds of Hindūstān [Sidenote: Fol. 141.] are found amongst\r\nthem, such as the parrot, _mīna_, peacock and _lūja_ (_lūkha_), the ape,\r\n_nīl-gāu_ and hog-deer (_kūta-pāī_);[842] some found there are not found\r\neven in Hindūstān.\r\n\r\nThe mountains to the west of Kābul are also all of one sort, those of\r\nthe Zindān-valley, the Ṣūf-valley, Garzawān and Gharjistān\r\n(Gharchastān).[843] Their meadows are mostly in the dales; they have not\r\nthe same sweep of grass on slope and top as some of those described\r\nhave; nor have they masses of trees; they have, however, grass suiting\r\nhorses. On their flat tops, where all the crops are grown, there is\r\nground where a horse can gallop. They have masses of _kīyik_.[844] Their\r\nvalley-bottoms are strongholds, mostly precipitous and inaccessible from\r\nabove. It is remarkable that, whereas other mountains have their\r\nfastnesses in their high places, these have theirs below.\r\n\r\nOf one sort again are the mountains of Ghūr, Karnūd (var. Kuzūd) and\r\nHazāra; their meadows are in their dales; their trees are few, not even\r\nthe _archa_ being there;[845] their grass is fit for horses and for the\r\nmasses of sheep they keep. They differ from those last described in\r\nthis, their strong places are not below.\r\n\r\nThe mountains (south-east of Kābul) of Khwāja Ismā`īl, Dasht, Dūgī\r\n(Dūkī)[846] and Afghānistān are all alike; all low, scant of vegetation,\r\nshort of water, treeless, ugly and good-for-nothing. Their people take\r\nafter them, just as has been said, _Tīng būlmā-ghūncha_ [Sidenote: Fol\r\n141b.] _tūsh būlmās_.[847] Likely enough the world has few mountains so\r\nuseless and disgusting.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Fire-wood of Kabul._)\r\n\r\nThe snow-fall being so heavy in Kābul, it is fortunate that excellent\r\nfire-wood is had near by. Given one day to fetch it, wood can be had of\r\nthe _khanjak_ (mastic), _bīlūt_ (holm-oak), _bādāmcha_ (small-almond)\r\nand _qarqand_.[848] Of these _khanjak_ wood is the best; it burns with\r\nflame and nice smell, makes plenty of hot ashes and does well even if\r\nsappy. Holm-oak is also first-rate fire-wood, blazing less than mastic\r\nbut, like it, making a hot fire with plenty of hot ashes, and nice\r\nsmell. It has the peculiarity in burning that when its leafy branches\r\nare set alight, they fire up with amazing sound, blazing and crackling\r\nfrom bottom to top. It is good fun to burn it. The wood of the\r\nsmall-almond is the most plentiful and commonly-used, but it does not\r\nmake a lasting fire. The _qarqand_ is quite a low shrub, thorny, and\r\nburning sappy or dry; it is the fuel of the Ghaznī people.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Fauna of Kābul._)\r\n\r\nThe cultivated lands of Kābul lie between mountains which are like great\r\ndams[849] to the flat valley-bottoms in which most villages and peopled\r\nplaces are. On these mountains _kīyik_ and _āhū_[850] are scarce.\r\nAcross them, between its summer and winter quarters, the dun sheep,[851]\r\nthe _arqārghalcha_, have their regular track,[852] to which braves go\r\nout with dogs and birds[853] to take them. [Sidenote: Fol. 142.] Towards\r\nKhūrd-kābul and the Sūrkh-rūd there is wild-ass, but there are no white\r\n_kīyik_ at all; Ghaznī has both and in few other places are white\r\n_kīyik_ found in such good condition.[854]\r\n\r\nIn the heats the fowling-grounds of Kābul are crowded. The birds take\r\ntheir way along the Bārān-water. For why? It is because the river has\r\nmountains along it, east and west, and a great Hindū-kush pass in a line\r\nwith it, by which the birds must cross since there is no other\r\nnear.[855] They cannot cross when the north wind blows, or if there is\r\neven a little cloud on Hindū-kush; at such times they alight on the\r\nlevel lands of the Bārān-water and are taken in great numbers by the\r\nlocal people. Towards the end of winter, dense flocks of mallards\r\n(_aūrdūq_) reach the banks of the Bārān in very good condition. Follow\r\nthese the cranes and herons,[856] great birds, in large flocks and\r\ncountless numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Bird-catching._)\r\n\r\nAlong the Bārān people take masses of cranes (_tūrna_) with the cord;\r\nmasses of _aūqār_, _qarqara_ and _qūṯān_ also.[857] This method of\r\nbird-catching is unique. They twist a cord as long as the arrow's[858]\r\nflight, tie the arrow at one end and a _bīldūrga_[859] at the other, and\r\nwind it up, from the arrow-end, on a piece of wood, span-long and\r\nwrist-thick, right up to the _bīldūrga_. They [Sidenote: Fol. 142b.]\r\nthen pull out the piece of wood, leaving just the hole it was in. The\r\n_bīldūrga_ being held fast in the hand, the arrow is shot off[860]\r\ntowards the coming flock. If the cord twists round a neck or wing, it\r\nbrings the bird down. On the Bārān everyone takes birds in this way; it\r\nis difficult; it must be done on rainy nights, because on such nights\r\nthe birds do not alight, but fly continually and fly low till dawn, in\r\nfear of ravening beasts of prey. Through the night the flowing river is\r\ntheir road, its moving water showing through the dark; then it is, while\r\nthey come and go, up and down the river, that the cord is shot. One\r\nnight I shot it; it broke in drawing in; both bird and cord were brought\r\nin to me next day. By this device Bārān people catch the many herons\r\nfrom which they take the turban-aigrettes sent from Kābul for sale in\r\nKhurāsān.\r\n\r\nOf bird-catchers there is also the band of slave-fowlers, two or three\r\nhundred households, whom some descendant of Tīmūr Beg made migrate from\r\nnear Multān to the Bārān.[861] Bird-catching [Sidenote: Fol. 143.] is\r\ntheir trade; they dig tanks, set decoy-birds[862] on them, put a net\r\nover the middle, and in this way take all sorts of birds. Not fowlers\r\nonly catch birds, but every dweller on the Bārān does it, whether by\r\nshooting the cord, setting the springe, or in various other ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Fishing._)\r\n\r\nThe fish of the Bārān migrate at the same seasons as birds. At those\r\ntimes many are netted, and many are taken on wattles (_chīgh_) fixed in\r\nthe water. In autumn when the plant known as _wild-ass-tail_[863] has\r\ncome to maturity, flowered and seeded, people take 10-20 loads (of\r\nseed?) and 20-30 of green branches (_gūk-shībāk_) to some head of water,\r\nbreak it up small and cast it in. Then going into the water, they can at\r\nonce pick up drugged fish. At some convenient place lower down, in a\r\nhole below a fall, they will have fixed beforehand a wattle of\r\nfinger-thick willow-withes, making it firm by piling stones on its\r\nsides. The water goes rushing and dashing through the wattle, but leaves\r\non it any fish that may have come floating down. This way of catching\r\nfish is practised in Gul-bahār, Parwān and Istālīf.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 143b.] Fish are had in winter in the Lamghānāt by this\r\ncurious device:—People dig a pit to the depth of a house, in the bed of\r\na stream, below a fall, line it with stones like a cooking-place, and\r\nbuild up stones round it above, leaving one opening only, under water.\r\nExcept by this one opening, the fish have no inlet or outlet, but the\r\nwater finds its way through the stones. This makes a sort of fish-pond\r\nfrom which, when wanted in winter, fish can be taken, 30-40 together.\r\nExcept at the opening, left where convenient, the sides of the fish-pond\r\nare made fast with rice-straw, kept in place by stones. A piece of\r\nwicker-work is pulled into the said opening by its edges, gathered\r\ntogether, and into this a second piece, (a tube,) is inserted, fitting\r\nit at the mouth but reaching half-way into it only.[864] The fish go\r\nthrough the smaller piece into the larger one, out from which they\r\ncannot get. The second narrows towards its inner mouth, its pointed ends\r\nbeing drawn so close that the fish, once entered, cannot [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n144.] turn, but must go on, one by one, into the larger piece. Out of\r\nthat they cannot return because of the pointed ends of the inner, narrow\r\nmouth. The wicker-work fixed and the rice-straw making the pond fast,\r\nwhatever fish are inside can be taken out;[865] any also which, trying\r\nto escape may have gone into the wicker-work, are taken in it, because\r\nthey have no way out. This method of catching fish we have seen nowhere\r\nelse.[866]\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NARRATIVE RESUMED.[867]\r\n\r\n(_a. Departure of Muqīm and allotment of lands._)\r\n\r\nA few days after the taking of Kābul, Muqīm asked leave to set off for\r\nQandahār. As he had come out of the town on terms and conditions, he was\r\nallowed to go to his father (Ẕu'n-nūn) and his elder brother (Shāh Beg),\r\nwith all his various people, his goods and his valuables, safe and\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nDirectly he had gone, the Kābul-country was shared out to the Mīrzās and\r\nthe guest-begs.[868] To Jahāngīr Mīrzā was given Ghaznī with its\r\ndependencies and appurtenancies; to Nāṣir Mīrzā, the Nīngnahār _tūmān_,\r\nMandrāwar, Nūr-valley, Kūnār, Nūr-gal (Rock-village?) and Chīghān-sarāī.\r\nTo some of the begs who had been with us in the guerilla-times and had\r\ncome to Kābul with us, were given villages, fief-fashion.[869] _Wilāyat_\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 144b.] itself was not given at all.[870] It was not only\r\nthen that I looked with more favour on guest-begs and stranger-begs than\r\nI did on old servants and Andijānīs; this I have always done whenever\r\nthe Most High God has shown me His favour; yet it is remarkable that,\r\nspite of this, people have blamed me constantly as though I had favoured\r\nnone but old servants and Andijānīs. There is a proverb, (Turkī) \"What\r\nwill a foe not say? what enters not into dream?\" and (Persian) \"A\r\ntown-gate can be shut, a foe's mouth never.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. A levy in grain._)\r\n\r\nMany clans and hordes had come from Samarkand, Ḥiṣār and Qūndūz into the\r\nKābul-country. Kābul is a small country; it is also of the sword, not of\r\nthe pen;[871] to take in money from it for all these tribesmen was\r\nimpossible. It therefore seemed advisable to take in grain, provision\r\nfor the families of these clans so that their men could ride on forays\r\nwith the army. Accordingly it was decided to levy 30,000 ass-loads[872]\r\nof grain on Kābul, Ghaznī and their dependencies; we knew nothing at\r\nthat time about the harvests and incomings; the impost was excessive,\r\nand under it the country suffered very grievously.\r\n\r\nIn those days I devised the Bāburī script.[873]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Foray on the Hazāra._)\r\n\r\nA large tribute in horses and sheep had been laid on the Sulṯān Mas`ūdī\r\nHazāras;[874] word came a few days after collectors [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n145.] had gone to receive it, that the Hazāras were refractory and would\r\nnot give their goods. As these same tribesmen had before that come down\r\non the Ghaznī and Gīrdīz roads, we got to horse, meaning to take them by\r\nsurprise. Riding by the Maidān-road, we crossed the Nirkh-pass[875] by\r\nnight and at the Morning-prayer fell upon them near Jāl-tū (var.\r\nChā-tū). The incursion was not what was wished.[876] We came back by the\r\nTunnel-rock (Sang-i-sūrākh); Jahāngīr Mīrzā (there?) took leave for\r\nGhaznī. On our reaching Kābul, Yār-i-ḥusain, son of Daryā Khān, coming\r\nin from Bhīra, waited on me.[877]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Bābur's first start for Hindūstān._)\r\n\r\nWhen, a few days later, the army had been mustered, persons acquainted\r\nwith the country were summoned and questioned about its every side and\r\nquarter. Some advised a march to the Plain (Dasht);[878] some approved\r\nof Bangash; some wished to go into Hindūstān. The discussion found\r\nsettlement in a move on Hindūstān.\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of Sha`bān (910 AH.-Jan. 1505 AD.), the Sun being in\r\nAquarius, that we rode out of Kābul for Hindūstān. We took the road\r\nby Bādām-chashma and Jagdālīk and reached Adīnapūr in six marches. Till\r\nthat time I had never seen a hot country or the Hindūstān border-land.\r\nIn Nīngnahār[879] another world came to view,—other grasses, other\r\ntrees, other animals, other birds, and other manners and customs of clan\r\nand horde. We were amazed, and truly there was ground for amaze.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 145b.]\r\n\r\nNāṣir Mīrzā, who had gone earlier to his district, waited on me in\r\nAdīnapūr. We made some delay in Adīnapūr in order to let the men from\r\nbehind join us, also a contingent from the clans which had come with us\r\ninto Kābul and were wintering in the Lamghānāt.[880] All having joined\r\nus, we marched to below Jūī-shāhī and dismounted at Qūsh-guṃbaz.[881]\r\nThere Nāṣir Mīrzā asked for leave to stay behind, saying he would follow\r\nin a few days after making some sort of provision for his dependants and\r\nfollowers. Marching on from Qūsh-guṃbaz, when we dismounted at\r\nHot-spring (Garm-chashma), a head-man of the Gāgīānī was brought in, a\r\n_Fajjī_[882] presumably with his caravan. We took him with us to point\r\nout the roads. Crossing Khaibar in a march or two, we dismounted at\r\nJām.[883]\r\n\r\nTales had been told us about Gūr-khattrī;[884] it was said to be a holy\r\nplace of the Jogīs and Hindūs who come from long distances to shave\r\ntheir heads and beards there. I rode out at once from Jām to visit\r\nBīgrām,[885] saw its great tree,[886] and all the country round, but,\r\nmuch as we enquired about Gūr-khattrī, our guide, one Malik Bū-sa`īd\r\n_Kamarī_,[887] would say nothing [Sidenote: Fol. 146.] about it. When we\r\nwere almost back in camp, however, he told Khwāja Muḥammad-amīn that it\r\nwas in Bīgrām and that he had said nothing about it because of its\r\nconfined cells and narrow passages. The Khwāja, having there and then\r\nabused him, repeated to us what he had said, but we could not go back\r\nbecause the road was long and the day far spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Move against Kohāt._)\r\n\r\nWhether to cross the water of Sind, or where else to go, was discussed\r\nin that camp.[888] Bāqī _Chaghānīānī_ represented that it seemed we\r\nmight go, without crossing the river and with one night's halt, to a\r\nplace called Kohāt where were many rich tribesmen; moreover he brought\r\nKābulīs forward who represented the matter just as he had done. We had\r\nnever heard of the place, but, as he, my man in great authority, saw it\r\ngood to go to Kohāt and had brought forward support of his\r\nrecommendation,—this being so! we broke up our plan of crossing the\r\nSind-water into Hindūstān, marched from Jām, forded the Bāra-water, and\r\ndismounted not far from the pass (_dābān_) through the Muḥammad-mountain\r\n(_fajj_). At the time the Gāgīānī Afghāns were located in Parashawār\r\nbut, in dread of our army, had drawn off to the skirt-hills. One of\r\ntheir headmen, coming into this camp, did me obeisance; we took him, as\r\nwell as the Fajjī, with us, so that, between them, they might\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 146b.] point out the roads. We left that camp at\r\nmidnight, crossed Muḥammad-fajj at day-rise[889] and by breakfast-time\r\ndescended on Kohāt. Much cattle and buffalo fell to our men; many\r\nAfghāns were taken but I had them all collected and set them free. In\r\nthe Kohāt houses corn was found without limit. Our foragers raided as\r\nfar as the Sind-river (_daryā_), rejoining us after one night's halt. As\r\nwhat Bāqī _Chaghānīānī_ had led us to expect did not come to hand, he\r\ngrew rather ashamed of his scheme.\r\n\r\nWhen our foragers were back and after two nights in Kohāt, we took\r\ncounsel together as to what would be our next good move, and we decided\r\nto over-run the Afghāns of Bangash and the Bannū neighbourhood, then to\r\ngo back to Kābul, either through Naghr (Bāghzān?), or by the Farmūl-road\r\n(Tochī-valley?).\r\n\r\nIn Kohāt, Daryā Khān's son, Yār-i-ḥusain, who had waited on me in Kābul\r\nmade petition, saying, \"If royal orders were given me for the\r\nDilazāk,[890] the Yūsuf-zāī, and the Gāgīānī, these would not go far\r\nfrom my orders if I called up the Pādshāh's swords on the other side of\r\nthe water of Sind.\"[891] The farmān he petitioned for being given, he\r\nwas allowed to go from Kohāt.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. March to Thāl._)\r\n\r\nMarching out of Kohāt, we took the Hangū-road for Bangash. [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 147.] Between Kohāt and Hangū that road runs through a valley shut\r\nin on either hand by the mountains. When we entered this valley, the\r\nAfghāns of Kohāt and thereabouts who were gathered on both hill-skirts,\r\nraised their war-cry with great clamour. Our then guide, Malik Bū-sa`īd\r\n_Kamarī_ was well-acquainted with the Afghān locations; he represented\r\nthat further on there was a detached hill on our right, where, if the\r\nAfghāns came down to it from the hill-skirt, we might surround and take\r\nthem. God brought it right! The Afghāns, on reaching the place, did come\r\ndown. We ordered one party of braves to seize the neck of land between\r\nthat hill and the mountains, others to move along its sides, so that\r\nunder attack made from all sides at once, the Afghāns might be made to\r\nreach their doom. Against the allround assault, they could not even\r\nfight; a hundred or two were taken, some were brought in alive but of\r\nmost, the heads only were brought. We had been told that when Afghāns\r\nare powerless to resist, they go before their foe with grass between\r\ntheir teeth, this being as much as to say, \"I am your cow.\"[892] Here\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 147b.] we saw this custom; Afghāns unable to make\r\nresistance, came before us with grass between their teeth. Those our men\r\nhad brought in as prisoners were ordered to be beheaded and a pillar of\r\ntheir heads was set up in our camp.[893]\r\n\r\nNext day we marched forward and dismounted at Hangū, where local Afghāns\r\nhad made a _sangur_ on a hill. I first heard the word _sangur_ after\r\ncoming to Kābul where people describe fortifying themselves on a hill as\r\nmaking a _sangur_. Our men went straight up, broke into it and cut off a\r\nhundred or two of insolent Afghān heads. There also a pillar of heads\r\nwas set up.\r\n\r\nFrom Hangū we marched, with one night's halt, to Tīl (Thāl),[894] below\r\nBangash; there also our men went out and raided the Afghāns near-by;\r\nsome of them however turned back rather lightly from a _sangur_.[895]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Across country into Bannū._)\r\n\r\nOn leaving Tīl (Thāl) we went, without a road, right down a steep\r\ndescent, on through out-of-the-way narrows, halted one night, and next\r\nday came down into Bannū,[896] man, horse and camel all worn out with\r\nfatigue and with most of the booty in cattle left on the way. The\r\nfrequented road must have been a few miles to our right; the one we came\r\nby did not seem a riding-road at all; it was understood to be called\r\nthe Gosfandliyār [Sidenote: Fol. 148.] (Sheep-road),—_liyār_ being\r\nAfghānī for a road,—because sometimes shepherds and herdsmen take their\r\nflocks and herds by it through those narrows. Most of our men regarded\r\nour being brought down by that left-hand road as an ill-design of Malik\r\nBū-sa`īd _Kamarī_.[897]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Bannū and the `Īsa-khail country._)\r\n\r\nThe Bannū lands lie, a dead level, immediately outside the Bangash and\r\nNaghr hills, these being to their north. The Bangash torrent (the Kūrām)\r\ncomes down into Bannū and fertilizes its lands. South(-east) of them are\r\nChaupāra and the water of Sind; to their east is Dīn-kot; (south-)west\r\nis the Plain (Dasht), known also as Bāzār and Tāq.[898] The Bannū lands\r\nare cultivated by the Kurānī, Kīwī, Sūr, `Īsa-khail and Nīā-zāī of the\r\nAfghān tribesmen.\r\n\r\nAfter dismounting in Bannū, we heard that the tribesmen in the Plain\r\n(Dasht) were for resisting and were entrenching themselves on a hill to\r\nthe north. A force headed by Jahāngīr Mīrzā, went against what seemed to\r\nbe the Kīwī _sangur_, took it at once, made general slaughter, cut off\r\nand brought in many heads. Much white cloth fell into (their) hands. In\r\nBannū also a pillar of heads was set up. After the _sangur_ had been\r\ntaken, the Kīwī head-man, Shādī Khān, came to my presence, with grass\r\nbetween his teeth, and did me obeisance. I pardoned all the prisoners.\r\n\r\nAfter we had over-run Kohāt, it had been decided that Bangash and Bannū\r\nshould be over-run, and return to Kābul [Sidenote: Fol. 148b.] made\r\nthrough Naghr or through Farmūl. But when Bannū had been over-run,\r\npersons knowing the country represented that the Plain was close by,\r\nwith its good roads and many people; so it was settled to over-run the\r\nPlain and to return to Kābul afterwards by way of Farmūl.[899]\r\n\r\nMarching next day, we dismounted at an `Īsa-khail village on that same\r\nwater (the Kūrām) but, as the villagers had gone into the Chaupāra hills\r\non hearing of us, we left it and dismounted on the skirt of Chaupāra.\r\nOur foragers went from there into the hills, destroyed the `Īsa-khail\r\n_sangur_ and came back with sheep, herds and cloth. That night the\r\n`Īsa-khail made an attack on us but, as good watch was kept all through\r\nthese operations, they could do nothing. So cautious were we that at\r\nnight our right and left, centre and van were just in the way they had\r\ndismounted, each according to its place in battle, each prepared for its\r\nown post, with men on foot all round the camp, at an arrow's distance\r\nfrom the tents. Every night the army was posted in this way and every\r\nnight three or four of my household [Sidenote: Fol. 149.] made the\r\nrounds with torches, each in his turn. I for my part made the round once\r\neach night. Those not at their posts had their noses slit and were led\r\nround through the army. Jahāngīr Mīrzā was the right wing, with Bāqī\r\n_Chaghānīānī_, Sherīm T̤aghāī, Sayyid Ḥusain Akbar, and other begs.\r\nMīrzā Khān was the left wing, with `Abdu'r-razzāq Mīrzā, Qāsīm Beg and\r\nother begs. In the centre there were no great begs, all were\r\nhousehold-begs. Sayyid Qāsim Lord-of-the-gate, was the van, with Bābā\r\nAūghūlī, Allāh-bīrdī (var. Allāh-qulī Purān), and some other begs. The\r\narmy was in six divisions, each of which had its day and night on guard.\r\n\r\nMarching from that hill-skirt, our faces set west, we dismounted on a\r\nwaterless plain (_qūl_) between Bannū and the Plain. The soldiers got\r\nwater here for themselves, their herds and so on, by digging down, from\r\none to one-and-a-half yards, into the dry water-course, when water came.\r\nNot here only did this happen for all the rivers of Hindūstān have the\r\npeculiarity that water is safe to be found by digging down from one to\r\none-and-a-half yards in their beds. It is a wonderful provision\r\nof God that where, except for the great rivers, there are no\r\nrunning-waters,[900] water should be so placed within reach in dry\r\nwater-courses.\r\n\r\nWe left that dry channel next morning. Some of our men, riding light,\r\nreached villages of the Plain in the afternoon, raided a few, and\r\nbrought back flocks, cloth and horses bred for trade.[901] Pack-animals\r\nand camels and also the braves we had outdistanced, kept coming into\r\ncamp all through that night till dawn and on till that morrow's noon.\r\nDuring our stay there, the foragers [Sidenote: Fol. 149b.] brought in\r\nfrom villages in the Plain, masses of sheep and cattle, and, from Afghān\r\ntraders met on the roads, white cloths, aromatic roots, sugars,\r\n_tīpūchāqs_, and horses bred for trade. Hindī (var. Mindī) _Mughūl_\r\nunhorsed Khwāja Khiẓr _Lūhānī_, a well-known and respected Afghān\r\nmerchant, cutting off and bringing in his head. Once when Sherīm T̤aghāī\r\nwent in the rear of the foragers, an Afghān faced him on the road and\r\nstruck off his index-finger.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Return made for Kābul._)\r\n\r\nTwo roads were heard of as leading from where we were to Ghaznī; one was\r\nthe Tunnel-rock (Sang-i-sūrākh) road, passing Birk (Barak) and going on\r\nto Farmūl; the other was one along the Gūmāl, which also comes out at\r\nFarmūl but without touching Birk (Barak).[902] As during our stay in the\r\nPlain rain had fallen incessantly, the Gūmāl was so swollen that it\r\nwould have been difficult to cross at the ford we came to; moreover\r\npersons well-acquainted with the roads, represented that going by the\r\nGūmāl road, this torrent must be crossed several times, that this was\r\nalways difficult when the waters were so high and that there was always\r\nuncertainty on the Gūmāl road. Nothing was settled then as to which of\r\nthese two roads to take; I expected it to be settled next day when,\r\nafter the drum of departure had sounded, [Sidenote: Fol. 150.] we talked\r\nit over as we went.[903] It was the `Īd-i-fitr (March 7th 1505 AD.);\r\nwhile I was engaged in the ablutions due for the breaking of the fast,\r\nJahāngīr Mīrzā and the begs discussed the question of the roads.\r\nSome-one said that if we were to turn the bill[904] of the Mehtar\r\nSulaimān range, this lying between the Plain and the Hill-country\r\n(_desht u dūkī_),[905] we should get a level road though it might make\r\nthe difference of a few marches. For this they decided and moved off;\r\nbefore my ablutions were finished the whole army had taken the road and\r\nmost of it was across the Gūmāl. Not a man of us had ever seen the road;\r\nno-one knew whether it was long or short; we started off just on a\r\nrumoured word!\r\n\r\nThe Prayer of the `Id was made on the bank of the Gūmāl. That year\r\nNew-year's Day[906] fell close to the `Id-i-fitr, there being only a few\r\ndays between; on their approximation I composed the following (Turkī)\r\node:—\r\n\r\n   Glad is the Bairām-moon for him who sees both the face of the Moon and\r\n     the Moon-face of his friend;\r\n   Sad is the Bairām-moon for me, far away from thy face and from\r\n     thee.[907]\r\n\r\n   O Bābur! dream of your luck when your Feast is the meeting,\r\n     your New-year the face;\r\n   For better than that could not be with a hundred New-years\r\n     and Bairāms.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Gūmāl torrent, we took our way along the skirt of the\r\nhills, our faces set south. A mile or two further on, [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n150b.] some death-devoted Afghāns shewed themselves on the lower edge of\r\nthe hill-slope. Loose rein, off we went for them; most of them fled but\r\nsome made foolish stand on rocky-piles[908] of the foot-hills. One took\r\npost on a single rock seeming to have a precipice on the further side of\r\nit, so that he had not even a way of escape. Sl. Qulī _Chūnāq_\r\n(One-eared), all in his mail as he was, got up, slashed at, and took\r\nhim. This was one of Sl. Qulī's deeds done under my own eyes, which led\r\nto his favour and promotion.[909] At another pile of rock, when\r\nQūtlūq-qadam exchanged blows with an Afghān, they grappled and came down\r\ntogether, a straight fall of 10 to 12 yards; in the end Qūtlūq-qadam\r\ncut off and brought in his man's head. Kūpūk Beg got hand-on-collar with\r\nan Afghān at another hill; both rolled down to the bottom; that head\r\nalso was brought in. All Afghāns taken prisoner were set free.\r\n\r\nMarching south through the Plain, and closely skirting Mehtar Sulaimān,\r\nwe came, with three nights' halt, to a small township, called Bīlah, on\r\nthe Sind-water and dependent on Multān.[910] The villagers crossed the\r\nwater, mostly taking to their boats, but some flung themselves in to\r\ncross. Some were seen standing on an island in front of Bīlah. Most of\r\nour men, man and horse in [Sidenote: Fol. 151.] mail, plunged in and\r\ncrossed to the island; some were carried down, one being Qul-i-arūk\r\n(thin slave), one of my servants, another the head tent-pitcher, another\r\nJahāngīr Mīrzā's servant, Qāītmās _Turkmān_.[911] Cloth and things of\r\nthe baggage (_partaldīk nīma_) fell to our men. The villagers all\r\ncrossed by boat to the further side of the river; once there, some of\r\nthem, trusting to the broad water, began to make play with their swords.\r\nQul-i-bāyazīd, the taster, one of our men who had crossed to the island,\r\nstripped himself and his horse and, right in front of them, plunged by\r\nhimself into the river. The water on that side of the island may have\r\nbeen twice or thrice as wide as on ours. He swum his horse straight for\r\nthem till, an arrow's-flight away, he came to a shallow where his weight\r\nmust have been up-borne, the water being as high as the saddle-flap.\r\nThere he stayed for as long as milk takes to boil; no-one supported him\r\nfrom behind; he had not a chance of support. He made a dash at them;\r\nthey shot a few arrows at him but, this not checking him, they took to\r\nflight. To swim such a river as the Sind, alone, bare on a bare-backed\r\nhorse, no-one behind him, and to chase off a foe and occupy his ground,\r\nwas a mightily bold deed! He having driven the enemy off, other soldiers\r\nwent over who [Sidenote: Fol. 151b.] returned with cloth and droves of\r\nvarious sorts. Qul-i-bāyazīd had already his place in my favour and\r\nkindness on account of his good service, and of courage several times\r\nshewn; from the cook's office I had raised him to the royal taster's;\r\nthis time, as will be told, I took up a position full of bounty, favour\r\nand promotion,—in truth he was worthy of honour and advancement.\r\n\r\nTwo other marches were made down the Sind-water. Our men, by perpetually\r\ngallopping off on raids, had knocked up their horses; usually what they\r\ntook, cattle mostly, was not worth the gallop; sometimes indeed in the\r\nPlain there had been sheep, sometimes one sort of cloth or other, but,\r\nthe Plain left behind, nothing was had but cattle. A mere servant would\r\nbring in 3 or 400 head during our marches along the Sind-water, but\r\nevery march many more would be left on the road than they brought in.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. The westward march._)\r\n\r\nHaving made three more marches[912] close along the Sind, we left it\r\nwhen we came opposite Pīr Kānū's tomb.[913] Going to the tomb, we there\r\ndismounted. Some of our soldiers having injured [Sidenote: Fol. 152.]\r\nseveral of those in attendance on it, I had them cut to pieces. It is a\r\ntomb on the skirt of one of the Mehtar Sulaimān mountains and held in\r\nmuch honour in Hindūstān.\r\n\r\nMarching on from Pīr Kānū, we dismounted in the (Pawat) pass; next again\r\nin the bed of a torrent in Dūkī.[914] After we left this camp there were\r\nbrought in as many as 20 to 30 followers of a retainer of Shāh Beg,\r\nFāẓil _Kūkūldāsh_, the dārogha of Sīwī. They had been sent to\r\nreconnoitre us but, as at that time, we were not on bad terms with Shāh\r\nBeg, we let them go, with horse and arms. After one night's halt, we\r\nreached Chūtīālī, a village of Dūkī.\r\n\r\nAlthough our men had constantly gallopped off to raid, both before we\r\nreached the Sind-water and all along its bank, they had not left horses\r\nbehind, because there had been plenty of green food and corn. When,\r\nhowever, we left the river and set our faces for Pīr Kānū, not even\r\ngreen food was to be had; a little land under green crop might be found\r\nevery two or three marches, but of horse-corn, none. So, beyond the\r\ncamps mentioned, there began the leaving of horses behind. After passing\r\nChūtīālī, my own felt-tent[915] had to be left from want of\r\nbaggage-beasts. One night at that time, it rained so much, that water\r\nstood knee-deep in my tent (_chādār_); I watched the night out till\r\ndawn, uncomfortably sitting on a pile of blankets.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Bāqī Chaghānīānī's treachery._)\r\n\r\nA few marches further on came Jahāngīr Mīrzā, saying, \"I [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n152b.] have a private word for you.\" When we were in private, he said,\r\n\"Bāqī _Chaghānīānī_ came and said to me, 'You make the Pādshāh cross the\r\nwater of Sind with 7, 8, 10 persons, then make yourself Pādshāh.'\" Said\r\nI, \"What others are heard of as consulting with him?\" Said he, \"It was\r\nbut a moment ago Bāqī Beg spoke to me; I know no more.\" Said I, \"Find\r\nout who the others are; likely enough Sayyid Ḥusain Akbar and Sl. `Alī\r\nthe page are in it, as well as Khusrau Shāh's begs and braves.\" Here the\r\nMīrzā really behaved very well and like a blood-relation; what he now\r\ndid was the counterpart of what I had done in Kāhmard,[916] in this same\r\nill-fated mannikin's other scheme of treachery.[917]\r\n\r\nOn dismounting after the next march, I made Jahāngīr Mīrzā lead a body\r\nof well-mounted men to raid the Aūghāns (Afghāns) of that neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nMany men's horses were now left behind in each camping-ground, the day\r\ncoming when as many as 2 or 300 were left. Braves of the first rank went\r\non foot; Sayyid Maḥmūd _Aūghlāqchī_, one of the best of the\r\nhousehold-braves, left his horses behind and walked. In this state as to\r\nhorses we went all the rest of the way to Ghaznī.\r\n\r\nThree or four marches further on, Jahāngīr Mīrzā plundered [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 153.] some Afghāns and brought in a few sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. The Āb-i-istāda._)\r\n\r\nWhen, with a few more marches, we reached the Standing-water\r\n(_Āb-i-istāda_) a wonderfully large sheet of water presented itself to\r\nview; the level lands on its further side could not be seen at all; its\r\nwater seemed to join the sky; the higher land and the mountains of that\r\nfurther side looked to hang between Heaven and Earth, as in a mirage.\r\nThe waters there gathered are said to be those of the spring-rain floods\r\nof the Kattawāz-plain, the Zurmut-valley, and the Qarā-bāgh meadow of\r\nthe Ghaznī-torrent,—floods of the spring-rains, and the over-plus[918]\r\nof the summer-rise of streams.\r\n\r\nWhen within two miles of the Āb-i-istāda, we saw a wonderful\r\nthing,—something as red as the rose of the dawn kept shewing and\r\nvanishing between the sky and the water. It kept coming and going. When\r\nwe got quite close we learned that what seemed the cause were flocks of\r\ngeese,[919] not 10,000, not 20,000 in a flock, but geese innumerable\r\nwhich, when the mass of birds flapped their wings in flight, sometimes\r\nshewed red feathers, sometimes not. Not only was this bird there in\r\ncountless numbers, but birds of every sort. Eggs lay in masses on the\r\nshore. When two Afghāns, come there to collect eggs, saw us, [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 153b.] they went into the water half a _kuroh_ (a mile). Some of\r\nour men following, brought them back. As far as they went the water was\r\nof one depth, up to a horse's belly; it seemed not to lie in a hollow,\r\nthe country being flat.\r\n\r\nWe dismounted at the torrent coming down to the Āb-i-istāda from the\r\nplain of Kattawāz. The several other times we have passed it, we have\r\nfound a dry channel with no water whatever,[920] but this time, there\r\nwas so much water, from the spring-rains, that no ford could be found.\r\nThe water was not very broad but very deep. Horses and camels were made\r\nto swim it; some of the baggage was hauled over with ropes. Having got\r\nacross, we went on through Old Nānī and Sar-i-dih to Ghaznī where for a\r\nfew days Jahāngīr Mīrzā was our host, setting food before us and\r\noffering his tribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Return to Kābul._)\r\n\r\nThat year most waters came down in flood. No ford was found through the\r\nwater of Dih-i-yaq`ūb.[921] For this reason we went straight on to\r\nKamarī, through the Sajāwand-pass. At Kamarī I had a boat fashioned in a\r\npool, brought and set on the Dih-i-yaq`ūb-water in front of Kamarī. In\r\nthis all our people were put over.\r\n\r\nWe reached Kābul in the month of Ẕū'l-ḥijja (May 1505 AD.).[922] A few\r\ndays earlier Sayyid Yūsuf _Aūghlāqchī_ had gone to God's [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n154.] mercy through the pains of colic.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. Misconduct of Nāṣīr Mīrzā._)\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that at Qūsh-guṃbaz, Nāṣir Mīrzā asked leave to\r\nstay behind, saying that he would follow in a few days after taking\r\nsomething from his district for his retainers and followers.[923] But\r\nhaving left us, he sent a force against the people of Nūr-valley, they\r\nhaving done something a little refractory. The difficulty of moving in\r\nthat valley owing to the strong position of its fort and the\r\nrice-cultivation of its lands, has already been described.[924] The\r\nMīrzā's commander, Faẓlī, in ground so impracticable and in that\r\none-road tract, instead of safe-guarding his men, scattered them to\r\nforage. Out came the valesmen, drove the foragers off, made it\r\nimpossible to the rest to keep their ground, killed some, captured a\r\nmass of others and of horses,—precisely what would happen to any army\r\nchancing to be under such a person as Faẓlī! Whether because of this\r\naffair, or whether from want of heart, the Mīrzā did not follow us at\r\nall; he stayed behind.\r\n\r\nMoreover Ayūb's sons, Yūsuf and Bahlūl (Begchīk), more seditious, silly\r\nand arrogant persons than whom there may not exist,—to whom I had given,\r\nto Yūsuf Alangār, to Bahlūl `Alī-shang, they like Nāṣir Mīrzā, were to\r\nhave taken something from [Sidenote: Fol. 154b.] their districts and to\r\nhave come on with him, but, he not coming, neither did they. All that\r\nwinter they were the companions of his cups and social pleasures. They\r\nalso over-ran the Tarkalānī Afghāns in it.[925] With the on-coming\r\nheats, the Mīrzā made march off the families of the clans,\r\noutside-tribes and hordes who had wintered in Nīngnahār and the\r\nLamghānāt, driving them like sheep before him, with all their goods, as\r\nfar as the Bārān-water.[926]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. Affairs of Badakhshān._)\r\n\r\nWhile Nāṣir Mīrzā was in camp on the Bārān-water, he heard that the\r\nBadakhshīs were united against the Aūzbegs and had killed some of them.\r\n\r\nHere are the particulars:—When Shaibāq Khān had given Qūndūz to Qaṃbar\r\nBī and gone himself to Khwārizm[927]; Qaṃbar Bī, in order to conciliate\r\nthe Badakhshīs, sent them a son of Muḥammad-i-makhdūmī, Maḥmūd by name,\r\nbut Mubārak Shāh,—whose ancestors are heard of as begs of the Badakhshān\r\nShāhs,—having uplifted his own head, and cut off Maḥmūd's and those of\r\nsome Aūzbegs, made himself fast in the fort once known as Shāf-tiwār but\r\nre-named by him Qila`-i-ẕafar. Moreover, in Rustāq Muḥammad _qūrchī_, an\r\narmourer of Khusrau Shāh, then occupying Khamalangān, slew Shaibāq\r\nKhān's _ṣadr_ and some Aūzbegs and made that place fast. Zubair of Rāgh,\r\nagain, [Sidenote: Fol. 155.] whose forefathers also will have been begs\r\nof the Badakhshān Shāhs, uprose in Rāgh.[928] Jahāngīr _Turkmān_, again,\r\na servant of Khusrau Shāh's Walī, collected some of the fugitive\r\nsoldiers and tribesmen Walī had left behind, and with them withdrew into\r\na fastness.[929]\r\n\r\nNāṣir Mīrzā, hearing these various items of news and spurred on by the\r\ninstigation of a few silly, short-sighted persons to covet Badakhshān,\r\nmarched along the Shibr-tū and Āb-dara road, driving like sheep before\r\nhim the families of the men who had come into Kābul from the other side\r\nof the Amū.[930]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. Affairs of Khusrau Shāh._)\r\n\r\nAt the time Khusrau Shāh and Aḥmad-i-qāsim were in flight from Ājar for\r\nKhurāsān,[931] they meeting in with Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā and Ẕū'n-nūn\r\nBeg, all went on together to the presence of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā in Herī.\r\nAll had long been foes of his; all had behaved unmannerly to him; what\r\nbrands had they not set on his heart! Yet all now went to him in their\r\ndistress, and all went through me. For it is not likely they would have\r\nseen him if I had not made Khusrau Shāh helpless by parting him from his\r\nfollowing, and if I had not taken Kābul from Ẕū'n'nūn's son, Muqīm.\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā himself was as dough in the [Sidenote: Fol. 155b.]\r\nhands of the rest; beyond their word he could not go. Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā\r\ntook up a gracious attitude towards one and all, mentioned no-one's\r\nmisdeeds, even made them gifts.\r\n\r\nShortly after their arrival Khusrau Shāh asked for leave to go to his\r\nown country, saying, \"If I go, I shall get it all into my hands.\" As he\r\nhad reached Herī without equipment and without resources, they finessed\r\na little about his leave. He became importunate. Muḥammad Barandūq\r\nretorted roundly on him with, \"When you had 30,000 men behind you and\r\nthe whole country in your hands, what did you effect against the Aūzbeg?\r\nWhat will you do now with your 500 men and the Aūzbegs in possession?\"\r\nHe added a little good advice in a few sensible words, but all was in\r\nvain because the fated hour of Khusrau Shāh's death was near. Leave was\r\nat last given because of his importunity; Khusrau Shāh with his 3 or 400\r\nfollowers, went straight into the borders of Dahānah. There as Nāṣir\r\nMīrzā had just gone across, these two met.\r\n\r\nNow the Badakhshī chiefs had invited only the Mīrzā; they had not\r\ninvited Khusrau Shāh. Try as the Mīrzā did to persuade Khusrau Shāh to\r\ngo into the hill-country,[932] the latter, quite understanding the whole\r\ntime, would not consent to go, his own idea being that if he marched\r\nunder the Mīrzā, he would get the [Sidenote: Fol. 156.] country into his\r\nown hands. In the end, unable to agree, each of them, near Ishkīmīsh,\r\narrayed his following, put on mail, drew out to fight, and—departed.\r\nNāṣir Mīrzā went on for Badakhshān; Khusrau Shāh after collecting a\r\ndisorderly rabble, good and bad of some 1,000 persons, went, with the\r\nintention of laying siege to Qūndūz, to Khwāja Chār-tāq, one or two\r\n_yīghāch_ outside it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_q. Death of Khusrau Shāh._)\r\n\r\nAt the time Shaibāq Khān, after overcoming Sulṯān Aḥmad _Taṃbal_ and\r\nAndijān, made a move on Ḥiṣār, his Honour Khusrau Shāh[933] flung away\r\nhis country (Qūndūz and Ḥiṣār) without a blow struck, and saved himself.\r\nThereupon Shaibāq Khān went to Ḥiṣār in which were Sherīm the page and a\r\nfew good braves. _They_ did not surrender Ḥiṣār, though their honourable\r\nbeg had flung _his_ country away and gone off; they made Ḥiṣār fast. The\r\nsiege of Ḥiṣār Shaibāq Khān entrusted to Ḥamza Sl. and Mahdī\r\nSulṯān,[934] went to Qūndūz, gave Qūndūz to his younger brother, Maḥmūd\r\nSulṯān and betook himself without delay to Khwārizm against Chīn Ṣūfī.\r\nBut as, before he reached Samarkand on his way to Khwārizm, he heard of\r\nthe death in Qūndūz of his brother, Maḥmūd Sulṯān, he gave that place to\r\nQaṃbar Bī of Marv.[935]\r\n\r\nQaṃbar Bī was in Qūndūz when Khusrau Shāh went against it; he at once\r\nsent off galloppers to summon Ḥamza Sl. and the [Sidenote: Fol. 156b.]\r\nothers Shaibāq Khān had left behind. Ḥamza Sl. came himself as far as\r\nthe _sarāī_ on the Amū bank where he put his sons and begs in command of\r\na force which went direct against Khusrau Shāh. There was neither fight\r\nnor flight for that fat, little man; Ḥamza Sulṯān's men unhorsed him,\r\nkilled his sister's son, Aḥmad-i-qāsim, Sherīm the page and several good\r\nbraves. Him they took into Qūndūz, there struck his head off and from\r\nthere sent it to Shaibāq Khān in Khwārizm.[936]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_r. Conduct in Kābul of Khusrau Shāh's retainers._)\r\n\r\nJust as Khusrau Shāh had said they would do, his former retainers and\r\nfollowers, no sooner than he marched against Qūndūz, changed in their\r\ndemeanour to me,[937] most of them marching off to near\r\nKhwāja-i-riwāj.[938] The greater number of the men in my service had\r\nbeen in his. The Mughūls behaved well, taking up a position of adherence\r\nto me.[939] On all this the news of Khusrau Shāh's death fell like water\r\non fire; it put his men out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n911 AH.—JUNE 4TH 1505 TO MAY 24TH 1506 AD.[940]\r\n\r\n(_a. Death of Qūtlūq-nigār Khānīm._)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of Muḥarram my mother had fever. Blood was let without\r\neffect and a Khurāsānī doctor, known as Sayyid T̤abīb, in accordance\r\nwith the Khurāsān practice, gave her water-melon, but her time to die\r\nmust have come, for on the [Sidenote: Fol. 157.] Saturday after six days\r\nof illness, she went to God's mercy.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday I and Qāsim Kūkūldāsh conveyed her to the New-year's Garden on\r\nthe mountain-skirt[941] where Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā had built a house, and\r\nthere, with the permission of his heirs,[942] we committed her to the\r\nearth. While we were mourning for her, people let me know about (the\r\ndeath of) my younger Khān _dādā_ Alacha Khān, and my grandmother\r\nAīsān-daulat Begīm.[943] Close upon Khānīm's Fortieth[944] arrived from\r\nKhurāsān Shāh Begīm the mother of the Khāns, together with my\r\nmaternal-aunt Mihr-nigār Khānīm, formerly of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā's _ḥaram_,\r\nand Muḥammad Ḥusain _Kūrkān Dūghlāt_.[945] Lament broke out afresh; the\r\nbitterness of these partings was extreme. When the mourning-rites had\r\nbeen observed, food and victuals set out for the poor and destitute, the\r\nQorān recited, and prayers offered for the departed souls, we steadied\r\nourselves and all took heart again.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. A futile start for Qandahār._)\r\n\r\nWhen set free from these momentous duties, we got an army to horse for\r\nQandahār under the strong insistance of Bāqī _Chaghānīānī_. At the\r\nstart I went to Qūsh-nādir (var. nāwar) where on dismounting I got\r\nfever. It was a strange sort of illness for whenever with much trouble I\r\nhad been awakened, my eyes closed again in sleep. In four or five days I\r\ngot quite well.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. An earthquake._)\r\n\r\nAt that time there was a great earthquake[946] such that most of the\r\nramparts of forts and the walls of gardens fell down; houses were\r\nlevelled to the ground in towns and villages and many persons lay dead\r\nbeneath them. Every house fell in Paghmān-village, [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n157b.] and 70 to 80 strong heads-of-houses lay dead under their walls.\r\nBetween Pagh-mān and Beg-tūt[947] a piece of ground, a good\r\nstone-throw[948] wide may-be, slid down as far as an arrow's-flight;\r\nwhere it had slid springs appeared. On the road between Istarghach and\r\nMaidān the ground was so broken up for 6 to 8 _yīghāch_ (36-48 m.) that\r\nin some places it rose as high as an elephant, in others sank as deep;\r\nhere and there people were sucked in. When the Earth quaked, dust rose\r\nfrom the tops of the mountains. Nūru'l-lāh the _ṯambourchī_[949] had\r\nbeen playing before me; he had two instruments with him and at the\r\nmoment of the quake had both in his hands; so out of his own control was\r\nhe that the two knocked against each other. Jahāngīr Mīrzā was in the\r\nporch of an upper-room at a house built by Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā in Tīpa;\r\nwhen the Earth quaked, he let himself down and was not hurt, but the\r\nroof fell on some-one with him in that upper-room, presumably one of his\r\nown circle; that this person was not hurt in the least must have been\r\nsolely through God's mercy. In Tīpa most of the houses were levelled to\r\nthe ground. The Earth quaked 33 times on the first day, and for a month\r\nafterwards used to quake two or three times in the 24 hours. The begs\r\nand soldiers having been ordered to repair the breaches made in the\r\ntowers and ramparts [Sidenote: Fol. 158.] of the fort (Kābul),\r\neverything was made good again in 20 days or a month by their industry\r\nand energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Campaign against Qalāt-i-ghilzāī._)\r\n\r\nOwing to my illness and to the earthquake, our plan of going to Qandahār\r\nhad fallen somewhat into the background. The illness left behind and the\r\nfort repaired, it was taken up again. We were undecided at the time we\r\ndismounted below Shniz[950] whether to go to Qandahār, or to over-run\r\nthe hills and plains. Jahāngīr Mīrzā and the begs having assembled,\r\ncounsel was taken and the matter found settlement in a move on Qalāt. On\r\nthis move Jahāngīr Mīrzā and Bāqī _Chaghānīānī_ insisted strongly.\r\n\r\nAt Tāzī[951] there was word that Sher-i-`alī the page with Kīchīk Bāqī\r\n_Diwāna_ and others had thoughts of desertion; all were arrested;\r\nSher-i-`alī was put to death because he had given clear signs of\r\ndisloyalty and misdoing both while in my service and not in mine, in\r\nthis country and in that country.[952] The others were let go with loss\r\nof horse and arms.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Qalāt we attacked at once and from all sides, without our\r\nmail and without siege-appliances. As has been mentioned in this\r\nHistory, Kīchīk Khwāja, the elder brother of Khwāja Kalān, was a most\r\ndaring brave; he had used his sword [Sidenote: Fol. 158b.] in my\r\npresence several times; he now clambered up the south-west tower of\r\nQalāt, was pricked in the eye with a spear when almost up, and died of\r\nthe wound two or three days after the place was taken. Here that Kīchīk\r\nBāqī _Dīwāna_ who had been arrested when about to desert with\r\nSher-i-`alī the page, expiated his baseness by being killed with a stone\r\nwhen he went under the ramparts. One or two other men died also.\r\nFighting of this sort went on till the Afternoon Prayer when, just as\r\nour men were worn-out with the struggle and labour, those in the fort\r\nasked for peace and made surrender. Qalāt had been given by Ẕū'n-nūn\r\n_Arghūn_ to Muqīm, and in it now were Muqīm's retainers, Farrukh\r\n_Arghūn_ and Qarā _Bīlūt_ (Afghān). When they came out with their swords\r\nand quivers hanging round their necks, we forgave their offences.[953]\r\nIt was not my wish to reduce this high family[954] to great straits; for\r\nwhy? Because if we did so when such a foe as the Aūzbeg was at our side,\r\nwhat would be said by those of far and near, who saw and heard?\r\n\r\nAs the move on Qalāt had been made under the insistance of Jahāngīr\r\nMīrzā and Bāqī _Chaghānīānī_, it was now made over to the Mīrzā's\r\ncharge. He would not accept it; Bāqī also could give no good answer in\r\nthe matter. So, after such a storming and assaulting of Qalāt, its\r\ncapture was useless.\r\n\r\nWe went back to Kābul after over-running the Afghāns of Sawā-sang and\r\nĀlā-tāgh on the south of Qalāt. [Sidenote: Fol. 159.]\r\n\r\nThe night we dismounted at Kābul I went into the fort; my tent and\r\nstable being in the Chār-bāgh, a Khirilchī thief going into the garden,\r\nfetched out and took away a bay horse of mine with its accoutrements,\r\nand my _khachar_.[955]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Death of Bāqī Chaghānīānī._)\r\n\r\nFrom the time Bāqī _Chaghānīanī_ joined me on the Amū-bank, no man of\r\nmine had had more trust and authority.[956] If a word were said, if an\r\nact were done, that word was his word, that act, his act. Spite of this,\r\nhe had not done me fitting service, nor had he shewn me due civility.\r\nQuite the contrary! he had done things bad and unmannerly. Mean he was,\r\nmiserly and malicious, ill-tongued, envious and cross-natured. So\r\nmiserly was he that although when he left Tīrmīẕ, with his family and\r\npossessions, he may have owned 30 to 40,000 sheep, and although those\r\nmasses of sheep used to pass in front of us at every camping-ground, he\r\ndid not give a single one to our bare braves, tortured as they were by\r\nthe pangs of hunger; at last in Kāh-mard, he gave 50!\r\n\r\nSpite of acknowledging me for his chief (_pādshāh_), he had nagarets\r\nbeaten at his own Gate. He was sincere to none, had regard for none.\r\nWhat revenue there is from Kābul (town) comes from the _ṯamghā_[957];\r\nthe whole of this he had, together [Sidenote: Fol. 159b.] with the\r\n_dārogha_-ship in Kābul and Panjhīr, the Gadai (var. Kidī) Hazāra, and\r\n_kūshlūk_[958] and control of the Gate.[959] With all this favour and\r\nfinding, he was not in the least content; quite the reverse! What medley\r\nof mischief he planned has been told; we had taken not the smallest\r\nnotice of any of it, nor had we cast it in his face. He was always\r\nasking for leave, affecting scruple at making the request. We used to\r\nacknowledge the scruple and excuse ourselves from giving the leave. This\r\nwould put him down for a few days; then he would ask again. He went too\r\nfar with his affected scruple and his takings of leave! Sick were we too\r\nof his conduct and his character. We gave the leave; he repented asking\r\nfor it and began to agitate against it, but all in vain! He got written\r\ndown and sent to me, \"His Highness made compact not to call me to\r\naccount till nine[960] misdeeds had issued from me.\" I answered with a\r\nreminder of eleven successive faults and sent this to him through Mullā\r\nBābā of Pashāghar. He submitted and was allowed to go towards Hindūstān,\r\ntaking his family and possessions. A few of his retainers escorted him\r\nthrough Khaibar and returned; he joined Bāqī _Gāgīānī's_ caravan and\r\ncrossed at Nīl-āb.\r\n\r\nDaryā Khān's son, Yār-i-ḥusain was then in Kacha-kot,[961] having drawn\r\ninto his service, on the warrant of the _farmān_ taken from me in Kohāt,\r\na few Afghāns of the Dilazāk (var. Dilah-zāk) and Yūsuf-zāī and also a\r\nfew Jats and Gujūrs.[962] With these he beat the roads, taking toll with\r\nmight and main. Hearing about Bāqī, he blocked the road, made the whole\r\nparty [Sidenote: Fol. 160.] prisoner, killed Bāqī and took his wife.\r\n\r\nWe ourselves had let Bāqī go without injuring him, but his own misdeeds\r\nrose up against him; his own acts defeated him.\r\n\r\n   Leave thou to Fate the man who does thee wrong;\r\n   For Fate is an avenging servitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Attack on the Turkmān Hazāras._)\r\n\r\nThat winter we just sat in the Chār-bāgh till snow had fallen once or\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\nThe Turkmān Hazāras, since we came into Kābul, had done a variety of\r\ninsolent things and had robbed on the roads. We thought therefore of\r\nover-running them, went into the town to Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā's house at the\r\nBūstān-sarāī, and thence rode out in the month of Sha`bān (Feb. 1506\r\nAD.).\r\n\r\nWe raided a few Hazāras at Janglīk, at the mouth of the Dara-i-khūsh\r\n(Happy-valley).[963] Some were in a cave near the valley-mouth, hiding\r\nperhaps. Shaikh Darwīsh Kūkūldāsh went incautiously right (_auq_) up to\r\nthe cave-mouth, was shot (_aūqlāb_) in the nipple by a Hazāra inside and\r\ndied there and then (_aūq_).[964]\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on Shaikh Darwīsh._) He had been with me in\r\n   the guerilla-times, was Master-armourer (_qūr-begī_), drew a\r\n   strong bow and shot a good shaft.\r\n\r\nAs most of the Turkmān Hazāras seemed to be wintering inside the\r\nDara-i-khūsh, we marched against them.\r\n\r\nThe valley is shut in,[965] by a mile-long gully stretching inwards from\r\nits mouth. The road engirdles the mountain, having [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n160b.] a straight fall of some 50 to 60 yards below it and above it a\r\nprecipice. Horsemen go along it in single-file. We passed the gully and\r\nwent on through the day till between the Two Prayers (3 p.m.) without\r\nmeeting a single person. Having spent the night somewhere, we found a\r\nfat camel[966] belonging to the Hazāras, had it killed, made part of its\r\nflesh into _kabābs_[967] and cooked part in a ewer (_aftāb_). Such good\r\ncamel-flesh had never been tasted; some could not tell it from mutton.\r\n\r\nNext day we marched on for the Hazāra winter-camp. At the first watch (9\r\na.m.) a man came from ahead, saying that the Hazāras had blocked a ford\r\nin front with branches, checked our men and were fighting. That winter\r\nthe snow lay very deep; to move was difficult except on the road. The\r\nswampy meadows (_tuk-āb_) along the stream were all frozen; the stream\r\ncould only be crossed from the road because of snow and ice. The Hazāras\r\nhad cut many branches, put them at the exit from the water and were\r\nfighting in the valley-bottom with horse and foot or raining [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 161.] arrows down from either side.\r\n\r\nMuḥammad `Alī _Mubashshir_[968] Beg, one of our most daring braves,\r\nnewly promoted to the rank of beg and well worthy of favour, went along\r\nthe branch-blocked road without his mail, was shot in the belly and\r\ninstantly surrendered his life. As we had gone forward in haste, most of\r\nus were not in mail. Shaft after shaft flew by and fell; with each one\r\nYūsuf's Aḥmad said anxiously, \"Bare[969] like this you go into it! I\r\nhave seen two arrows go close to your head!\" Said I, \"Don't fear! Many\r\nas good arrows as these have flown past my head!\" So much said, Qāsim\r\nBeg, his men in full accoutrement,[970] found a ford on our right and\r\ncrossed. Before their charge the Hazāras could make no stand; they fled,\r\nswiftly pursued and unhorsed one after the other by those just up with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn guerdon for this feat Bangash was given to Qāsim Beg. Ḥātim the\r\narmourer having been not bad in the affair, was promoted to Shaikh\r\nDarwīsh's office of _qūr-begī_. Bābā Qulī's Kīpik (_sic_) also went well\r\nforward in it, so we entrusted Muḥ. `Alī _Mubashshir's_ office to him.\r\n\r\nSl. Qulī _Chūnāq_ (one-eared) started in pursuit of the Hazāras but\r\nthere was no getting out of the hollow because of the snow. [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 161b.] For my own part I just went with these braves.\r\n\r\nNear the Hazāra winter-camp we found many sheep and herds of horses. I\r\nmyself collected as many as 4 to 500 sheep and from 20 to 25 horses.\r\nSl. Qulī _Chūnāq_ and two or three of my personal servants were with me.\r\nI have ridden in a raid twice[971]; this was the first time; the other\r\nwas when, coming in from Khurāsān (912 AH.), we raided these same\r\nTurkmān Hazāras. Our foragers brought in masses of sheep and horses. The\r\nHazāra wives and their little children had gone off up the snowy slopes\r\nand stayed there; we were rather idle and it was getting late in the\r\nday; so we turned back and dismounted in their very dwellings. Deep\r\nindeed was the snow that winter! Off the road it was up to a horse's\r\n_qāptāl_,[972] so deep that the night-watch was in the saddle all\r\nthrough till shoot of dawn.\r\n\r\nGoing out of the valley, we spent the next night just inside the mouth,\r\nin the Hazāra winter-quarters. Marching from there, we dismounted at\r\nJanglīk. At Janglīk Yārak T̤aghāī and other late-comers were ordered to\r\ntake the Hazāras who had killed Shaikh Darwīsh and who, luckless and\r\ndeath-doomed, seemed still to be in the cave. Yārak T̤aghāī and his band\r\nby sending smoke into the cave, took 70 to 80 Hazāras who mostly died by\r\nthe sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Collection of the Nijr-aū tribute._)\r\n\r\nOn the way back from the Hazāra expedition we went to the Āī-tūghdī\r\nneighbourhood below Bārān[973] in order to collect the revenue of\r\nNijr-aū. Jahāngīr Mīrzā, come up from Ghaznī, [Sidenote: Fol. 162.]\r\nwaited on me there. At that time, on Ramẓān 13th (Feb. 7th) such\r\nsciatic-pain attacked me that for 40 days some-one had to turn me over\r\nfrom one side to the other.\r\n\r\nOf the (seven) valleys of the Nijr-water the Pīchkān-valley,—and of the\r\nvillages in the Pīchkān-valley Ghain,—and of Ghain its head-man Ḥusain\r\n_Ghainī_ in particular, together with his elder and younger brethren,\r\nwere known and notorious for obstinacy and daring. On this account a\r\nforce was sent under Jahāngīr Mīrzā, Qāsim Beg going too, which went to\r\nSar-i-tūp (Hill-top), stormed and took a _sangur_ and made a few meet\r\ntheir doom.\r\n\r\nBecause of the sciatic pain, people made a sort of litter for me in\r\nwhich they carried me along the bank of the Bārān and into the town to\r\nthe Būstān-sarāī. There I stayed for a few days; before that trouble was\r\nover a boil came out on my left cheek; this was lanced and for it I also\r\ntook a purge. When relieved, I went out into the Chār-bāgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Misconduct of Jahāngīr Mīrzā._)\r\n\r\nAt the time Jahāngīr Mīrzā waited on me, Ayūb's sons Yūsuf and Buhlūl,\r\nwho were in his service, had taken up a strifeful and seditious attitude\r\ntowards me; so the Mīrzā was not found to be what he had been earlier.\r\nIn a few days he marched out of Tīpa in his mail,[974] hurried back to\r\nGhaznī, there took Nānī, killed some of its people and plundered all.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 162b.] After that he marched off with whatever men he\r\nhad, through the Hazāras,[975] his face set for Bāmīān. God knows that\r\nnothing had been done by me or my dependants to give him ground for\r\nanger or reproach! What was heard of later on as perhaps explaining his\r\ngoing off in the way he did, was this;—When Qāsim Beg went with other\r\nbegs, to give him honouring meeting as he came up from Ghaznī, the Mīrzā\r\nthrew a falcon off at a quail. Just as the falcon, getting close, put\r\nout its pounce to seize the quail, the quail dropped to the ground.\r\nHereupon shouts and cries, \"Taken! is it taken?\" Said Qāsim Beg, \"Who\r\nlooses the foe in his grip?\" Their misunderstanding of this was their\r\nsole reason for going off, but they backed themselves on one or two\r\nother worse and weaker old cronish matters.[976] After doing in Ghaznī\r\nwhat has been mentioned, they drew off through the Hazāras to the Mughūl\r\nclans.[977] These clans at that time had left Nāṣir Mīrzā but had not\r\njoined the Aūzbeg, and were in Yāī, Astar-āb and the summer-pastures\r\nthereabouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā calls up help against Shaibāq Khān._)\r\n\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, having resolved to repel Shaibāq Khān, summoned all\r\nhis sons; me too he summoned, sending to me Sayyid Afẓal, son of Sayyid\r\n`Alī _Khwāb-bīn_ (Seer-of-dreams). It was right on several grounds for\r\nus to start for Khurāsān. One ground was that when a great ruler,\r\nsitting, as Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā sat, in Tīmūr Beg's place, had resolved to\r\nact against [Sidenote: Fol. 163.] such a foe as Shaibāq Khān and had\r\ncalled up many men and had summoned his sons and his begs, if there were\r\nsome who went on foot it was for us to go if on our heads! if some took\r\nthe bludgeon, we would take the stone! A second ground was that, since\r\nJahāngīr Mīrzā had gone to such lengths and had behaved so badly,[978]\r\nwe had either to dispel his resentment or to repel his attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Chīn Ṣūfī's death._)\r\n\r\nThis year Shaibāq Khān took Khwārizm after besieging Chīn Sūfī in it for\r\nten months. There had been a mass of fighting during the siege; many\r\nwere the bold deeds done by the Khwārizmī braves; nothing soever did\r\nthey leave undone. Again and again their shooting was such that their\r\narrows pierced shield and cuirass, sometimes the two cuirasses.[979] For\r\nten months they sustained that siege without hope in any quarter. A few\r\nbare braves then lost heart, entered into talk with the Aūzbeg and were\r\nin the act of letting him up into the fort when Chīn Ṣūfī had the news\r\nand went to the spot. Just as he was beating and forcing down the\r\nAūzbegs, his own page, in a discharge of arrows, shot him from behind.\r\nNo man was left to fight; the Aūzbegs took Khwārizm. God's mercy on\r\nChīn Ṣūfī, who never for one moment ceased to stake his life [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 163b.] for his chief![980]\r\n\r\nShaibāq Khān entrusted Khwārizm to Kūpuk (_sic_) Bī and went back to\r\nSamarkand.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Death of Sultān Ḥusain Mīrzā._)\r\n\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā having led his army out against Shaibāq Khān as far as\r\nBābā Ilāhī[981] went to God's mercy, in the month of Ẕū'l-ḥijja\r\n(Ẕū'l-ḥijja 11th 911 AH.-May 5th 1506 AD.).\r\n\r\n\r\nSULT̤ĀN ḤUSAIN MĪRZĀ AND HIS COURT.[982]\r\n\r\n(_a._) _His birth and descent._\r\n\r\nHe was born in Herī (Harāt), in (Muḥarram) 842 (AH.-June-July, 1438 AD.)\r\nin Shāhrukh Mīrzā's time[983] and was the son of Manṣūr Mīrzā, son of\r\nBāī-qarā Mīrzā, son of `Umar Shaikh Mīrzā, son of Amīr Tīmūr. Manṣūr\r\nMīrzā and Bāī-qarā Mīrzā never reigned.\r\n\r\nHis mother was Fīrūza Begīm, a (great-)grandchild (_nabīra_) of Tīmūr\r\nBeg; through her he became a grandchild of Mīrān-shāh also.[984] He was\r\nof high birth on both sides, a ruler of royal lineage.[985] Of the\r\nmarriage (of Manṣūr with Fīrūza) were born two sons and two daughters,\r\nnamely, Bāī-qarā Mīrzā and Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, Ākā Begīm and another\r\ndaughter, Badka Begīm whom Aḥmad Khān took.[986]\r\n\r\nBāī-qarā Mīrzā was older than Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā; he was his younger\r\nbrother's retainer but used not to be present as head of the Court;[987]\r\nexcept in Court, he used to share his brother's divan (_tūshak_). He was\r\ngiven Balkh by his younger brother and was its Commandant for several\r\nyears. He had three sons, Sl. Muḥammad Mīrzā, Sl. Wais Mīrzā and Sl.\r\nIskandar Mīrzā.[988]\r\n\r\nĀkā Begīm was older than the Mīrzā; she was taken by [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n164.] Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā,[989] a grandson (_nabīra_) of Mīrān-shāh; by him\r\nshe had a son (Muḥammad Sulṯān Mīrzā), known as Kīchīk (Little) Mīrzā,\r\nwho at first was in his maternal-uncle's service, but later on gave up\r\nsoldiering to occupy himself with letters. He is said to have become\r\nvery learned and also to have taste in verse.[990] Here is a Persian\r\nquatrain of his:—\r\n\r\n   For long on a life of devotion I plumed me,\r\n   As one of the band of the abstinent ranged me;\r\n   Where when Love came was devotion? denial?\r\n   By the mercy of God it is I have proved me!\r\n\r\nThis quatrain recalls one by the Mullā.[991] Kīchīk Mīrzā made the\r\ncircuit of the _ka'ba_ towards the end of his life.\r\n\r\nBadka (Badī`u'l-jamāl) Begīm also was older[992] than the Mīrzā. She was\r\ngiven in the guerilla times to Aḥmad Khān of Ḥājī-tarkhān;[993] by him\r\nshe had two sons (Sl. Maḥmūd Khān and Bahādur Sl.) who went to Herī and\r\nwere in the Mīrzā's service.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b._) _His appearance and habits._\r\n\r\nHe was slant-eyed (_qīyik gūzlūq_) and lion-bodied, being slender from\r\nthe waist downwards. Even when old and white-bearded, he wore silken\r\ngarments of fine red and green. He used to wear either the black\r\nlambskin cap (_būrk_) or the _qālpāq_,[994] but on a Feast-day would\r\nsometimes set up a little three-fold turban, wound broad and badly,[995]\r\nstick a heron's plume in it and so go to Prayers.\r\n\r\nWhen he first took Herī, he thought of reciting the names of [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 164b.] the Twelve Imāms in the _khuṯba_,[996] but `Alī-sher Beg and\r\nothers prevented it; thereafter all his important acts were done in\r\naccordance with orthodox law. He could not perform the Prayers on\r\naccount of a trouble in the joints,[997] and he kept no fasts. He was\r\nlively and pleasant, rather immoderate in temper, and with words that\r\nmatched his temper. He shewed great respect for the law in several\r\nweighty matters; he once surrendered to the Avengers of blood a son of\r\nhis own who had killed a man, and had him taken to the Judgment-gate\r\n(_Dāru'l-qaẓā_). He was abstinent for six or seven years after he took\r\nthe throne; later on he degraded himself to drink. During the almost 40\r\nyears of his rule[998] in Khurāsān, there may not have been one single\r\nday on which he did not drink after the Mid-day prayer; earlier than\r\nthat however he did not drink. What happened with his sons, the soldiers\r\nand the town was that every-one pursued vice and pleasure to excess.\r\nBold and daring he was! Time and again he got to work with his own\r\nsword, getting his own hand in wherever he arrayed to fight; no man of\r\nTīmūr Beg's line has been known to match him in the slashing of swords.\r\nHe had a leaning to poetry and even put a _dīwān_ together, writing in\r\nTurkī with Ḥusainī for his pen-name.[999] Many couplets in his _dīwān_\r\nare not bad; it is however in one and the same metre throughout. Great\r\nruler though he was, [Sidenote: Fol. 165.] both by the length of his\r\nreign (_yāsh_) and the breadth of his dominions, he yet, like little\r\npeople kept fighting-rams, flew pigeons and fought cocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c._) _His wars and encounters._[1000]\r\n\r\nHe swam the Gurgān-water[1001] in his guerilla days and gave a party of\r\nAūzbegs a good beating.\r\n\r\nAgain,—with 60 men he fell on 3000 under Pay-master Muḥammad `Alī, sent\r\nahead by Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā, and gave them a downright good beating\r\n(868 AH.). This was his one fine, out-standing feat-of-arms.[1002]\r\n\r\nAgain,—he fought and beat Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā near Astarābād (865\r\nAH.).[1003]\r\n\r\nAgain,—this also in Astarābād, he fought and beat Sa`īdlīq Sa`īd, son of\r\nḤusain _Turkmān_ (873 AH.?).\r\n\r\nAgain,—after taking the throne (of Herī in Ramẓān 873 AH.-March 1469\r\nAD.), he fought and beat Yādgār-i-muḥammad Mīrzā at Chanārān (874\r\nAH.).[1004]\r\n\r\nAgain,—coming swiftly[1005] from the Murgh-āb bridge-head (Sar-i-pul),\r\nhe fell suddenly on Yādgār-i-muḥammad Mīrzā where he lay drunk in the\r\nRavens'-garden (875 AH.), a victory which kept all Khurāsān quiet.\r\n\r\nAgain,—he fought and beat Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā at Chīkmān-sarāī in the\r\nneighbourhood of Andikhūd and Shibrghān (876 AH.).[1006]\r\n\r\nAgain,—he fell suddenly on Abā-bikr Mīrzā[1007] after that Mīrzā, joined\r\nby the Black-sheep Turkmāns, had come out of `Irāq, beaten Aūlūgh Beg\r\nMīrzā (_Kābulī_) in Takāna and Khimār (var. Ḥimār), taken Kābul, left it\r\nbecause of turmoil in `Irāq, crossed Khaibar, gone on to Khūsh-āb and\r\nMultān, on again to [Sidenote: Fol. 165b.] Sīwī,[1008] thence to Karmān\r\nand, unable to stay there, had entered the Khurāsān country (884\r\nAH.).[1009]\r\n\r\nAgain,—he defeated his son Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā at Pul-i-chirāgh (902\r\nAH.); he also defeated his sons Abū'l-muḥsin Mīrzā and Kūpuk\r\n(Round-shouldered) Mīrzā at Ḥalwā-spring (904 AH.).[1010]\r\n\r\nAgain,—he went to Qūndūz, laid siege to it, could not take it, and\r\nretired; he laid siege to Ḥiṣār, could not take that either, and rose\r\nfrom before it (901 AH.); he went into Ẕū'n-nūn's country, was given\r\nBast by its _dārogha_, did no more and retired (903 AH.).[1011] A ruler\r\nso great and so brave, after resolving royally on these three movements,\r\njust retired with nothing done!\r\n\r\nAgain,—he fought his son Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā in the Nīshīn-meadow, who\r\nhad come there with Ẕū'n-nūn's son, Shāh Beg (903 AH.). In that affair\r\nwere these curious coincidences:—The Mīrzā's force will have been small,\r\nmost of his men being in Astarābād; on the very day of the fight, one\r\nforce rejoined him coming back from Astarābād, and Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā\r\narrived to join Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā after letting Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā take\r\nḤiṣār, and Ḥaidar Mīrzā came back from reconnoitring Badī`u'z-zamān\r\nMīrzā at Sabzawār.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d._) _His countries._\r\n\r\nHis country was Khurāsān, with Balkh to the east, Bistām and Damghān to\r\nthe west, Khwārizm to the north, Qandahār [Sidenote: Fol. 166.] and\r\nSīstān to the south. When he once had in his hands such a town as Herī,\r\nhis only affair, by day and by night, was with comfort and pleasure; nor\r\nwas there a man of his either who did not take his ease. It followed of\r\ncourse that, as he no longer tolerated the hardships and fatigue of\r\nconquest and soldiering, his retainers and his territories dwindled\r\ninstead of increasing right down to the time of his departure.[1012]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e._) _His children._\r\n\r\nFourteen sons and eleven daughters were born to him.[1013] The oldest of\r\nall his children was Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā; (Bega Begīm) a daughter of\r\nSl. Sanjar of Marv, was his mother.\r\n\r\nShāh-i-gharīb Mīrzā was another; he had a stoop (_būkūrī_); though ill\r\nto the eye, he was of good character; though weak of body, he was\r\npowerful of pen. He even put a _dīwān_ together, using Gharbatī\r\n(Lowliness) for his pen-name and writing both Turkī and Persian verse.\r\nHere is a couplet of his:—\r\n\r\n   Seeing a peri-face as I passed, I became its fool;\r\n   Not knowing what was its name, where was its home.\r\n\r\nFor a time he was his father's Governor in Herī. He died before his\r\nfather, leaving no child.\r\n\r\nMuz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā was another; he was his father's favourite son,\r\nbut though this favourite, had neither accomplishments nor character. It\r\nwas Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's over-fondness for this son that led his other\r\nsons into rebellion. The mother of Shāh-i-gharīb Mīrzā and of\r\nMuz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā was [Sidenote: Fol. 166b.] Khadīja Begīm, a\r\nformer mistress of Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā by whom she had had a daughter\r\nalso, known as Āq (Fair) Begīm.\r\n\r\nTwo other sons were Abū'l-ḥusain Mīrzā and Kūpuk (var. Kīpik) Mīrzā\r\nwhose name was Muḥammad Muḥsin Mīrzā; their mother was Laṯīf-sulṯān\r\nĀghācha.\r\n\r\nAbū-turāb Mīrzā was another. From his early years he had an excellent\r\nreputation. When the news of his father's increased illness[1014]\r\nreached him and other news of other kinds also, he fled with his younger\r\nbrother Muḥammad-i-ḥusain Mīrzā into `Irāq,[1015] and there abandoned\r\nsoldiering to lead the darwish-life; nothing further has been heard\r\nabout him.[1016] His son Sohrāb was in my service when I took Ḥiṣār\r\nafter having beaten the sulṯāns led by Ḥamza Sl. and Mahdī Sl. (917\r\nAH.-1511 AD.); he was blind of one eye and of wretchedly bad aspect; his\r\ndisposition matched even his ill-looks. Owing to some immoderate act\r\n(_bī i`tidāl_), he could not stay with me, so went off. For some of his\r\nimmoderate doings, Nijm S̤ānī put him to death near Astarābād.[1017]\r\n\r\nMuḥammad-i-ḥusain Mīrzā was another. He must have been shut up (_bund_)\r\nwith Shāh Ismā`īl at some place in `Irāq and have become his\r\ndisciple;[1018] he became a rank heretic later on and became this\r\nalthough his father and brethren, older and younger, were all orthodox.\r\nHe died in Astarābād, still on the same wrong road, still with the same\r\nabsurd opinions. A good deal is heard about his courage and heroism, but\r\nno deed of his stands out as worthy of record. He may have been\r\npoetically-disposed; here is a couplet of his:—\r\n\r\n   Grimed with dust, from tracking what game dost thou come?\r\n   Steeped in sweat, from whose heart of flame dost thou come?\r\n\r\nFarīdūn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā was another. He drew a very strong [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 167.] bow and shot a first-rate shaft; people say his cross-bow\r\n(_kamān-i-guroha_) may have been 40 _bātmāns_.[1019] He himself was very\r\nbrave but he had no luck in war; he was beaten wherever he fought. He\r\nand his younger brother Ibn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā were defeated at Rabāṯ-i-dūzd\r\n(var. Dudūr) by Tīmūr Sl. and `Ubaid Sl. leading Shaibāq Khān's advance\r\n(913 AH.?), but he had done good things there.[1020] In Dāmghān he and\r\nMuḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā[1021] fell into the hands of Shaibāq Khān who,\r\nkilling neither, let both go free. Farīdūn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā went later on\r\nto Qalāt[1022] where Shāh Muḥammad _Diwāna_ had made himself fast; there\r\nwhen the Aūzbegs took the place, he was captured and killed. The three\r\nsons last-named were by Mīnglī Bībī Āghācha, Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's Aūzbeg\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nḤaidar Mīrzā was another; his mother Payānda-sulṯān Begīm was a daughter\r\nof Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā. Ḥaidar Mīrzā was Governor of Balkh and Mashhad\r\nfor some time during his father's life. For him his father, when\r\nbesieging Ḥiṣār (901 AH.) took (Bega Begīm) a daughter of Sl. Maḥmūd\r\nMīrzā and Khān-zāda Begīm; this done, he rose from before Ḥiṣār. One\r\ndaughter only[1023] was born of that marriage; she was named Shād (Joy)\r\nBegīm and given to `Ādil Sl.[1024] when she came to Kābul later on.\r\nḤaidar Mīrzā departed from the world in his father's [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n167b.] life-time.\r\n\r\nMuḥammad Ma`ṣūm Mīrzā was another. He had Qandahār given to him and, as\r\nwas fitting with this, a daughter of Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā, (Bega Begīm), was\r\nset aside for him; when she went to Herī (902 AH.), Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā\r\nmade a splendid feast, setting up a great _chār-ṯāq_ for it.[1025]\r\nThough Qandahār was given to Muḥ. Ma`ṣūm Mīrzā, he had neither power nor\r\ninfluence there, since, if black were done, or if white were done, the\r\nact was Shāh Beg _Arghūn's_. On this account the Mīrzā left Qandahār and\r\nwent into Khurāsān. He died before his father.\r\n\r\nFarrukh-i-ḥusain Mīrzā was another. Brief life was granted to him; he\r\nbade farewell to the world before his younger brother Ibrāhīm-i-ḥusain\r\nMīrzā.\r\n\r\nIbrāhīm-i-ḥusain Mīrzā was another. They say his disposition was not\r\nbad; he died before his father from bibbing and bibbing Herī wines.\r\n\r\nIbn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā and Muḥ. Qāsim Mīrzā were others;[1026] their story\r\nwill follow. Pāpā Āghācha was the mother of the five sons last-named.\r\n\r\nOf all the Mīrzā's daughters, Sulṯānīm Begīm was the oldest. She had no\r\nbrother or sister of the full-blood. Her mother, known as Chūlī (Desert)\r\nBegīm, was a daughter of one of the Aẕāq begs. Sulṯānīm Begīm had great\r\nacquaintance with words (_soz bīlūr aīdī_); she was never at fault for a\r\nword. Her father sent her out[1027] to Sl. Wais Mīrzā, the middle son of\r\nhis own elder brother Bāī-qarā Mīrzā; she had a son and a daughter by\r\nhim; the daughter was sent out to Aīsān-qulī Sl. younger brother of\r\nYīlī-bārs of the Shabān sulṯāns;[1028] the son is that Muḥammad Sl.\r\nMīrzā to whom I have given the Qanauj district.[1029] At that same date\r\nSulṯānīm Begīm, when on her way with her grandson [Sidenote: Fol. 168.]\r\nfrom Kābul to Hindūstān, went to God's mercy at Nīl-āb. Her various\r\npeople turned back, taking her bones; her grandson came on.[1030]\r\n\r\nFour daughters were by Payānda-sulṯān Begīm. Āq Begīm, the oldest, was\r\nsent out to Muḥammad Qāsim _Arlāt_, a grandson of Bega Begīm the younger\r\nsister of Bābur Mīrzā;[1031] there was one daughter (_bīr gīna qīz_),\r\nknown as Qarā-gūz (Dark-eyed) Begīm, whom Nāṣir Mīrzā (_Mīrān-shāhī_)\r\ntook. Kīchīk Begīm was the second; for her Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā had great\r\ndesire but, try as he would, Payānda-sulṯān Begīm, having an aversion\r\nfor him, would not give her to him;[1032] she sent Kīchīk Begīm out\r\nafterwards to Mullā Khwāja of the line of Sayyid Ātā.[1033] Her third\r\nand fourth daughters Bega Begīm and Āghā Begīm, she gave to Bābur Mīrzā\r\nand Murād Mīrzā the sons of her younger sister, Rābī`a-sulṯān\r\nBegīm.[1034]\r\n\r\nTwo other daughters of the Mīrzā were by Mīnglī Bībī Āghācha. They gave\r\nthe elder one, Bairam-sulṯān Begīm to Sayyid `Abdu'l-lāh, one of the\r\nsayyids of Andikhūd who was a grandson of Bāī-qarā Mīrzā[1035] through a\r\ndaughter. A son of this marriage, Sayyid Barka[1036] was in my service\r\nwhen Samarkand was taken (917 AH.-1511 AD.); he went to Aūrganj later\r\nand there made claim to rule; the Red-heads[1037] killed him in\r\nAstarābād. Mīnglī Bībī's second daughter was Fāṯima-sulṯān Begīm; her\r\nthey gave to Yādgār(-i-farrukh) Mīrzā of Tīmūr Beg's line.[1038]\r\n\r\nThree daughters[1039] were by Pāpā Āghācha. Of these the oldest,\r\nSulṯān-nizhād Begīm was made to go out to Iskandar Mīrzā, youngest son\r\nof Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's elder brother Bāī-qarā Mīrzā. The second,\r\n(Sa`ādat-bakht, known as) Begīm Sulṯān, [Sidenote: Fol. 168b.] was given\r\nto Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā after his blinding.[1040] By Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā she\r\nhad one daughter and one son. The daughter was brought up by Apāq Begīm\r\nof Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's _ḥaram_; from Herī she came to Kābul and was there\r\ngiven to Sayyid Mīrzā Apāq.[1041] (Sa`ādat-bakht) Begīm Sulṯān after the\r\nAūzbeg killed her husband, set out for the _ka`ba_ with her son.[1042]\r\nNews has just come (_circa_ 934 AH.) that they have been heard of as in\r\nMakka and that the boy is becoming a bit of a great personage.[1043]\r\nPāpā Āghācha's third daughter was given to a sayyid of Andikhūd,\r\ngenerally known as Sayyid Mīrzā.[1044]\r\n\r\nAnother of the Mīrzā's daughters, `Āyisha-sulṯān Begīm, was by a\r\nmistress, Zubaida Āghācha the grand-daughter of Ḥusain-i-Shaikh\r\nTīmūr.[1045] They gave her to Qāsim Sl. of the Shabān sulṯāns; she had\r\nby him a son, named Qāsim-i-ḥusain Sl. who came to serve me in\r\nHindūstān, was in the Holy Battle with Rānā Sangā, and was given\r\nBadāyūn.[1046] When Qāsim Sl. died, (his widow) `Āyisha-sulṯān Begīm was\r\ntaken by Būrān Sl. one of his relations,[1047] by whom she had a son,\r\nnamed `Abdu'l-lāh Sl. now serving me and though young, not doing badly.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. His wives and concubines._)\r\n\r\nThe wife he first took was Bega Sulṯān Begīm, a daughter of Sl. Sanjar\r\nof Marv. She was the mother of Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā. She was very\r\ncross-tempered and made the Mīrzā endure much wretchedness, until\r\ndriven at last to despair, he set himself [Sidenote: Fol. 169.] free by\r\ndivorcing her. What was he to do? Right was with him.[1048]\r\n\r\n   A bad wife in a good man's house\r\n   Makes this world already his hell.[1049]\r\n\r\nGod preserve every Musalmān from this misfortune! Would that not a\r\nsingle cross or ill-tempered wife were left in the world!\r\n\r\nChūlī Begīm was another; she was a daughter of the Aẕāq begs and was the\r\nmother of Sulṯānīm Begīm.\r\n\r\nShahr-bānū Begīm was another; she was Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā's daughter,\r\ntaken after Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā took the throne (873 AH.). When the Mīrzā's\r\nother ladies got out of their litters and mounted horses, at the battle\r\nof Chīkmān, Shahr-bānū Begīm, putting her trust in her younger brother\r\n(Sl. Maḥmūd M.), did not leave her litter, did not mount a horse;[1050]\r\npeople told the Mīrzā of this, so he divorced her and took her younger\r\nsister Payānda-sulṯān Begīm. When the Aūzbegs took Khurāsān (913 AH.),\r\nPayānda-sulṯān Begīm went into `Irāq, and in `Irāq she died in great\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nKhadīja Begīm was another.[1051] She had been a mistress of Sl.\r\nAbū-sa`īd Mīrzā and by him had had a daughter, Āq Begīm; after his\r\ndefeat (873 AH.-1468 AD.) she betook herself to Herī where Sl. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā took her, made her a great favourite, and promoted her to the rank\r\nof Begīm. Very dominant indeed she became later on; she it was wrought\r\nMuḥ. Mūmin Mīrzā's death;[1052] she in chief it was caused Sl. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā's sons to rebel against him. She took herself for a sensible woman\r\nbut was a silly chatterer, may also have been a heretic. Of her were\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 169b.] born Shāh-i-gharīb Mīrzā and Muz̤affar-i-ḥusain\r\nMīrzā.\r\n\r\nApāq Begīm was another;[1053] she had no children; that Pāpā Āghācha the\r\nMīrzā made such a favourite of was her foster-sister. Being childless,\r\nApāq Begīm brought up as her own the children of Pāpā Āghācha. She\r\nnursed the Mīrzā admirably when he was ill; none of his other wives\r\ncould nurse as she did. The year I came into Hindūstān (932 AH.)[1054]\r\nshe came into Kābul from Herī and I shewed her all the honour and\r\nrespect I could. While I was besieging Chandīrī (934 AH.) news came that\r\nin Kābul she had fulfilled God's will.[1055]\r\n\r\nOne of the Mīrzā's mistresses was Laṯīf-sulṯān Āghācha of the\r\nChār-shamba people[1056]; she became the mother of Abū'l-muḥsin Mīrzā\r\nand Kūpuk (or Kīpik) Mīrzā (_i.e._ Muḥammad Muḥsin).\r\n\r\nAnother mistress was Mīnglī Bībī Āghācha,[1057] an Aūzbeg and one of\r\nShahr-bānū Begīm's various people. She became the mother of Abū-turāb\r\nMīrzā, Muḥammad-i-ḥusain Mīrzā, Farīdūn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā and of two\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nPāpā Āghācha, the foster-sister of Apāq Begīm was another mistress. The\r\nMīrzā saw her, looked on her with favour, took her and, as has been\r\nmentioned, she became the mother of five of his sons and four of his\r\ndaughters.[1058]\r\n\r\nBegī Sulṯān Āghācha was another mistress; she had no child. There were\r\nalso many concubines and mistresses held in little respect; those\r\nenumerated were the respected wives and mistresses of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā.\r\n\r\nStrange indeed it is that of the 14 sons born to a ruler so great as Sl.\r\nḤusain Mīrzā, one governing too in such a town as Herī, three only were\r\nborn in legal marriage.[1059] In him, in his sons, and in his tribes and\r\nhordes vice and debauchery were [Sidenote: Fol. 170.] extremely\r\nprevalent. What shews this point precisely is that of the many sons born\r\nto his dynasty not a sign or trace was left in seven or eight years,\r\nexcepting only Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā.[1060]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. His amīrs._)\r\n\r\nThere was Muḥammad Barandūq _Barlās_, descending from Chākū _Barlās_ as\r\nfollows,—Muḥammad Barandūq, son of `Alī, son of Barandūq, son of\r\nJahān-shāh, son of Chākū _Barlās_.[1061] He had been a beg of Bābur\r\nMīrzā's presence; later on Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā favoured him, gave him\r\nKābul conjointly with Jahāngīr _Barlās_, and made him Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā's\r\nguardian. After the death of Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā, Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā\r\nformed designs against the two Barlās; they got to know this, kept tight\r\nhold of him, made the tribes and hordes march,[1062] moved as for\r\nQūndūz, and when up on Hindū-kush, courteously compelled Aūlūgh Beg\r\nMīrzā to start back for Kābul, they themselves going on to Sl. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā in Khurāsān, who, in his turn, shewed them great favour. Muḥammad\r\nBarandūq was remarkably intelligent, a very leaderlike man indeed! He\r\nwas extravagantly fond of a hawk; so much so, they say, that if a hawk\r\nof his had strayed or had died, he would ask, taking the names of his\r\nsons on his lips, what it would have mattered if such or such a son had\r\ndied or had broken his neck, rather than this or that bird had died or\r\nhad strayed.\r\n\r\nMuz̤affar _Barlās_ was another.[1063] He had been with the Mīrzā in the\r\nguerilla fighting and, for some cause unknown, had received extreme\r\nfavour. In such honour was he in those guerilla days that the compact\r\nwas for the Mīrzā to take four _dāng_ (sixths) [Sidenote: Fol. 170b.] of\r\nany country conquered, and for him to take two _dāng_. A strange compact\r\nindeed! How could it be right to make even a faithful servant a\r\nco-partner in rule? Not even a younger brother or a son obtains such a\r\npact; how then should a beg?[1064] When the Mīrzā had possession of the\r\nthrone, he repented the compact, but his repentance was of no avail;\r\nthat muddy-minded mannikin, favoured so much already, made growing\r\nassumption to rule. The Mīrzā acted without judgment; people say\r\nMuz̤affar _Barlās_ was poisoned in the end.[1065] God knows the truth!\r\n\r\n`Alī-sher _Nawā'ī_ was another, the Mīrzā's friend rather than his beg.\r\nThey had been learners together in childhood and even then are said to\r\nhave been close friends. It is not known for what offence Sl. Abū-sa`īd\r\nMīrzā drove `Alī-sher Beg from Herī; he then went to Samarkand where he\r\nwas protected and supported by Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg during the several years\r\nof his stay.[1066] He was noted for refinement of manner; people fancied\r\nthis due to the pride of high fortune but it may not have been so, it\r\nmay have been innate, since it was equally noticeable also in\r\nSamarkand.[1067] `Alī-sher Beg had no match. For as long as verse has\r\nbeen written in the Turkī tongue, no-one has written so much or so well\r\nas he. He wrote six books of poems (mas̤nawī), five of them answering to\r\nthe Quintet (_Khamsah_),[1068] the sixth, entitled the _Lisānu'ṯ-ṯair_\r\n(Tongue of the birds), was in the same metre as the _Manṯiqu'ṯ-ṯair_\r\n(Speech of the birds).[1069] He put together four _dīwāns_ (collections)\r\nof odes, bearing the names, _Curiosities of Childhood_, _Marvels of\r\nYouth_, _Wonders of Manhood_ and _Advantages of Age_.[1070] There are\r\ngood quatrains of his also. Some others of his compositions rank below\r\nthose [Sidenote: Fol. 171.] mentioned; amongst them is a collection of\r\nhis letters, imitating that of Maulānā `Abdu'r-raḥmān _Jāmī_ and aiming\r\nat gathering together every letter on any topic he had ever written to\r\nany person. He wrote also the _Mīzānu'l-aūzān_ (Measure of measures) on\r\nprosody; it is very worthless; he has made mistake in it about the\r\nmetres of four out of twenty-four quatrains, while about other measures\r\nhe has made mistake such as any-one who has given attention to prosody,\r\nwill understand. He put a Persian _dīwān_ together also, Fānī\r\n(transitory) being his pen-name for Persian verse.[1071] Some couplets\r\nin it are not bad but for the most part it is flat and poor. In music\r\nalso he composed good things (_nīma_), some excellent airs and preludes\r\n(_nakhsh u peshrau_). No such patron and protector of men of parts and\r\naccomplishments is known, nor has one such been heard of as ever\r\nappearing. It was through his instruction and support that Master\r\n(Ustād) Qul-i-muḥammad the lutanist, Shaikhī the flautist, and Ḥusain\r\nthe lutanist, famous performers all, rose to eminence and renown. It was\r\nthrough his effort and supervision that Master Bih-zād and Shāh\r\nMuz̤affar became so distinguished in painting. Few are heard of as\r\nhaving helped to lay the good foundation for future excellence he helped\r\nto lay. He had neither son nor daughter, wife or family; he let the\r\nworld pass by, alone and unencumbered. At first he was Keeper of the\r\nSeal; in middle-life he became a beg and for a time was Commandant in\r\nAstarābād; later on he forsook soldiering. He took nothing from the\r\nMīrzā, on the contrary, he each year [Sidenote: Fol. 171b.] offered\r\nconsiderable gifts. When the Mīrzā was returning from the Astarābād\r\ncampaign, `Alī-sher Beg went out to give him meeting; they saw one\r\nanother but before `Alī-sher Beg should have risen to leave, his\r\ncondition became such that he could not rise. He was lifted up and\r\ncarried away; the doctors could not tell what was wrong; he went to\r\nGod's mercy next day,[1072] one of his own couplets suiting his case:—\r\n\r\n   I was felled by a stroke out of their ken and mine;\r\n   What, in such evils, can doctors avail?\r\n\r\nAḥmad the son of Tawakkal _Barlās_ was another;[1073] for a time he held\r\nQandahār.\r\n\r\nWalī Beg was another; he was of Ḥājī Saifu'd-dīn Beg's line,[1074] and\r\nhad been one of the Mīrzā's father's (Manṣūr's) great begs.[1075] Short\r\nlife was granted to him after the Mīrzā took the throne (973 AH.); he\r\ndied directly afterwards. He was orthodox and made the Prayers, was\r\nrough (_turk_) and sincere.\r\n\r\nḤusain of Shaikh Tīmūr was another; he had been favoured and raised to\r\nthe rank of beg[1076] by Bābur Mīrzā.\r\n\r\nNuyān Beg was another. He was a Sayyid of Tīrmīẕ on his father's side;\r\non his mother's he was related both to Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā and to Sl.\r\nḤusain Mīrzā.[1077] Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā had favoured him; he was the beg\r\nhonoured in Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā's presence and he met with very great favour\r\nwhen he went to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's. He was a bragging, easy-going,\r\nwine-bibbing, jolly person. Through being in his father's service,[1078]\r\nḤasan of Ya`qūb used to be called also Nuyān's Ḥasan.\r\n\r\nJahāngīr _Barlās_ was another.[1079] For a time he shared the Kābul\r\ncommand with Muḥammad Barandūq _Barlās_, later on [Sidenote: Fol. 172.]\r\nwent to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's presence and received very great favour. His\r\nmovements and poses (_ḥarakāt u sakanāt_) were graceful and charming; he\r\nwas also a man of pleasant temper. As he knew the rules of hunting and\r\nhawking, in those matters the Mīrzā gave him chief charge. He was a\r\nfavourite of Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā and, bearing that Mīrzā's friendliness\r\nin mind, used to praise him.\r\n\r\nMīrzā Aḥmad of `Alī _Farsī Barlās_ was another. Though he wrote no\r\nverse, he knew what was poetry. He was a gay-hearted, elegant person,\r\none by himself.\r\n\r\n`Abdu'l-khalīq Beg was another. Fīrūz Shāh, Shāhrukh Mīrzā's greatly\r\nfavoured beg, was his grandfather;[1080] hence people called him Fīrūz\r\nShāh's `Abdu'l-khalīq. He held Khwārizm for a time.\r\n\r\nIbrāhīm _Dūldāī_ was another. He had good knowledge of revenue matters\r\nand the conduct of public business; his work was that of a second Muḥ.\r\nBarandūq.\r\n\r\nẔū'n-nūn _Arghūn_ was another.[1081] He was a brave man, using his sword\r\nwell in Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā's presence and later on getting his hand\r\ninto the work whatever the fight. As to his courage there was no\r\nquestion at all, but he was a bit of a fool. After he left our\r\n(_Mīrān-shāhī_) Mīrzās to go to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, the Mīrzā gave him\r\nGhūr and the Nikdīrīs. He did [Sidenote: Fol. 172b.] excellent work in\r\nthose parts with 70 to 80 men, with so few beating masses and masses of\r\nHazāras and Nikdīrīs; he had not his match for keeping those tribes in\r\norder. After a while Zamīn-dāwar was given to him. His son Shāh-i-shujā`\r\n_Arghūn_ used to move about with him and even in childhood used to chop\r\naway with his sword. The Mīrzā favoured Shāh-i-shujā` and, somewhat\r\nagainst Ẕū'n-nūn Beg's wishes, joined him with his father in the\r\ngovernment of Qandahār. Later on this father and son made dissension\r\nbetween that father and that son,[1082] and stirred up much commotion.\r\nAfter I had overcome Khusrau Shāh and parted his retainers from him, and\r\nafter I had taken Kābul from Ẕū'n-nūn _Arghūn_'s son Muqīm, Ẕū'n-nūn Beg\r\nand Khusrau Shāh both went, in their helplessness, to see Sl. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā. Ẕū'n-nūn _Arghūn_ grew greater after the Mīrzā's death when they\r\ngave him the districts of the Herī Koh-dāman, such as Aūba (Ubeh) and\r\nChachcharān.[1083] He was made Lord of Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's Gate[1084]\r\nand Muḥammad Barandūq _Barlās_ Lord of Muz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā's, when\r\nthe two Mīrzās became joint-rulers in Herī. Brave though he was, he was\r\na little crazed and shallow-pated; if he had not been so, would he have\r\naccepted flattery as he did? would he have made himself so contemptible?\r\nHere are the details of the matter:—While he was so dominant and so\r\ntrusted in Herī, a few shaikhs and mullās went to him and said, \"The\r\nSpheres are holding commerce with us; you are to be styled\r\n_Hizabru'l-lāh_ (Lion of God); you will overcome the Aūzbeg.\" Fully\r\naccepting this flattery, he put his _fūṯa_ (bathing-cloth) round his\r\nneck[1085] and gave thanks. Then, after Shaibāq Khān, coming against the\r\nMīrzās, had beaten them one [Sidenote: Fol. 173.] by one near Bādghīs,\r\nẔū'n-nūn _Arghūn_ met him face to face near Qarā-rabāṯ and, relying on\r\nthat promise, stood up against him with 100 to 150 men. A mass of\r\nAūzbegs came up, overcame them and hustled them off; he himself was\r\ntaken and put to death.[1086] He was orthodox and no neglecter of the\r\nPrayers, indeed made the extra ones. He was mad for chess; he played it\r\naccording to his own fancy and, if others play with one hand, he played\r\nwith both.[1087] Avarice and stinginess ruled in his character.\r\n\r\nDarwīsh-i-`alī Beg was another,[1088] the younger full-brother of\r\n`Alī-sher Beg. He had the Balkh Command for a time and there did good\r\nbeg-like things, but he was a muddle-head and somewhat wanting in merit.\r\nHe was dismissed from the Balkh Command because his muddle-headedness\r\nhad hampered the Mīrzā in his first campaign against Qūndūz and Ḥiṣār.\r\nHe came to my presence when I went to Qūndūz in 916 AH. (1510 AD.),\r\nbrutalized and stupefied, far from capable begship and out-side peaceful\r\nhome-life. Such favour as he had had, he appears to have had for\r\n`Alī-sher Beg's sake.\r\n\r\nMughūl Beg was another. He was Governor of Herī for a time, later on was\r\ngiven Astarābād, and from there fled to Ya`qūb Beg in `Irāq. He was of\r\namorous disposition[1089] and an incessant dicer.\r\n\r\nSayyid Badr (Full-moon) was another, a very strong man, [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n173b.] graceful in his movements and singularly well-mannered. He danced\r\nwonderfully well, doing one dance quite unique and seeming to be his own\r\ninvention.[1090] His whole service was with the Mīrzā whose comrade he\r\nwas in wine and social pleasure.\r\n\r\nIslīm _Barlās_ was another, a plain (_turk_) person who understood\r\nhawking well and did some things to perfection. Drawing a bow of 30 to\r\n40 _bātmāns_ strength,[1091] he would make his shaft pass right through\r\nthe target (_takhta_). In the gallop from the head of the\r\n_qabaq-maidān_,[1092] he would loosen his bow, string it again, and then\r\nhit the gourd (_qabaq_). He would tie his string-grip (_zih-gīr_) to the\r\none end of a string from 1 to 1-1/2 yards long, fasten the other end to\r\na tree, let his shaft fly, and shoot through the string-grip while it\r\nrevolved.[1093] Many such remarkable feats he did. He served the Mīrzā\r\ncontinuously and was at every social gathering.\r\n\r\nSl. Junaid _Barlās_ was another;[1094] in his latter days he went to Sl.\r\nAḥmad Mīrzā's presence.[1095] He is the father of the Sl. Junaid\r\n_Barlās_ on whom at the present time[1096] the joint-government of\r\nJaunpūr depends.\r\n\r\nShaikh Abū-sa`īd Khān _Dar-miyān_ (In-between) was another. It is not\r\nknown whether he got the name of Dar-miyān because he took a horse to\r\nthe Mīrzā _in the middle_ of a fight, or whether because he put himself\r\n_in between_ the Mīrzā and some-one designing on his life.[1097]\r\n\r\nBih-būd Beg was another. He had served in the pages' circle (_chuhra\r\njīrgasī_) during the guerilla times and gave such [Sidenote: Fol. 174.]\r\nsatisfaction by his service that the Mīrzā did him the favour of putting\r\nhis name on the stamp (_tamghā_) and the coin (_sikka_).[1098]\r\n\r\nShaikhīm Beg was another.[1099] People used to call him Shaikhīm\r\n_Suhailī_ because Suhailī was his pen-name. He wrote all sorts of verse,\r\nbringing in terrifying words and mental images. Here is a couplet of\r\nhis:—\r\n\r\n   In the anguish of my nights, the whirlpool of my sighs engulphs\r\n     the firmament;\r\n   Like a dragon, the torrent of my tears swallows the quarters of\r\n     the world.\r\n\r\nWell-known it is that when he once recited that couplet in Maulānā\r\n`Abdu'r-raḥmān _Jāmī's_ presence, the honoured Mullā asked him whether\r\nhe was reciting verse or frightening people. He put a _dīwān_ together;\r\n_mas̤nawīs_ of his are also in existence.\r\n\r\nMuḥammad-i-walī Beg was another, the son of the Walī Beg already\r\nmentioned. Latterly he became one of the Mīrzā's great begs but, great\r\nbeg though he was, he never neglected his service and used to recline\r\n(_yāstānīb_) day and night in the Gate. Through doing this, his free\r\nmeals and open table were always set just outside the Gate. Quite\r\ncertainly a man who was so constantly in waiting, _would_ receive the\r\nfavour he received! It is an evil noticeable today that effort must be\r\nmade before the man, dubbed Beg because he has five or six of the bald\r\nand blind at his back, can be got into the Gate at all! Where this sort\r\nof service is, it must be to their own misfortune! Muḥammad-i-walī Beg's\r\npublic table and free meals were good; he kept his servants neat and\r\nwell-dressed and with his own hands gave [Sidenote: Fol. 174b.] ample\r\nportion to the poor and destitute, but he was foul-mouthed and\r\nevil-spoken. He and also Darwīsh-i-`alī the librarian were in my service\r\nwhen I took Samarkand in 917 AH. (Oct. 1511 AD.); he was palsied then;\r\nhis talk lacked salt; his former claim to favour was gone. His assiduous\r\nwaiting appears to have been the cause of his promotion.\r\n\r\nBābā `Alī the Lord of the Gate was another. First, `Alī-sher Beg showed\r\nhim favour; next, because of his courage, the Mīrzā took him into\r\nservice, made him Lord of the Gate, and promoted him to be a beg. One of\r\nhis sons is serving me now (_circa_ 934 AH.), that Yūnas of `Alī who is\r\na beg, a confidant, and of my household. He will often be\r\nmentioned.[1100]\r\n\r\nBadru'd-dīn (Full-moon of the Faith) was another. He had been in the\r\nservice of Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā's Chief Justice Mīrak `Abdu'r-raḥīm; it\r\nis said he was very nimble and sure-footed, a man who could leap over\r\nseven horses at once. He and Bābā `Alī were close companions.\r\n\r\nḤasan of `Alī _Jalāīr_ was another. His original name was Ḥusain\r\n_Jalāīr_ but he came to be called `Alī's Ḥasan.[1101] His father `Alī\r\n_Jalāīr_ must have been favoured and made a beg by Bābur Mīrzā; no man\r\nwas greater later on when Yādgār-i-muḥammad M. took Herī. Ḥasan-i-`alī\r\nwas Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's _Qūsh-begī_.[1102] He made T̤ufailī\r\n(Uninvited-guest) his pen-name; wrote good odes and was the Master of\r\nthis art in his day. He wrote odes on my name when he came to my\r\npresence at the time I took Samarkand in 917 AH. (1511 AD.). Impudent\r\n(_bī bāk_) and [Sidenote: Fol. 175.] prodigal he was, a keeper of\r\ncatamites, a constant dicer and draught-player.\r\n\r\nKhwāja `Abdu'l-lāh _Marwārīd_ (Pearl)[1103] was another; he was at first\r\nChief Justice but later on became one of the Mīrzā's favourite\r\nhousehold-begs. He was full of accomplishments; on the dulcimer he had\r\nno equal, and he invented the shake on the dulcimer; he wrote in several\r\nscripts, most beautifully in the _ta`līq_; he composed admirable\r\nletters, wrote good verse, with Bayānī for his pen-name, and was a\r\npleasant companion. Compared with his other accomplishments, his verse\r\nranks low, but he knew what was poetry. Vicious and shameless, he became\r\nthe captive of a sinful disease through his vicious excesses, outlived\r\nhis hands and feet, tasted the agonies of varied torture for several\r\nyears, and departed from the world under that affliction.[1104]\r\n\r\nSayyid Muḥammad-i-aūrūs was another; he was the son of that Aūrūs\r\n(Russian?) _Arghūn_ who, when Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā took the throne, was\r\nhis beg in chief authority. At that time there were excellent\r\narcher-braves; one of the most distinguished was Sayyid\r\nMuḥammad-i-aūrūs. His bow strong, his shaft long, he must have been a\r\nbold (_yūrak_) shot and a good one. He was Commandant in Andikhūd for\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\nMir (Qaṃbar-i-)`alī the Master of the Horse was another. He it was who,\r\nby sending a man to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, brought him down on the\r\ndefenceless Yādgār-i-muḥammad Mīrzā.\r\n\r\nSayyid Ḥasan _Aūghlāqchī_ was another, a son of Sayyid _Aūghlāqchī_ and\r\na younger brother of Sayyid Yūsuf Beg.[1105] He was the father of a\r\ncapable and accomplished son, named Mīrzā Farrukh. He had come to my\r\npresence before I took Samarkand [Sidenote: Fol. 175b.] in 917 AH. (1511\r\nAD.). Though he had written little verse, he wrote fairly; he understood\r\nthe astrolabe and astronomy well, was excellent company, his talk good\r\ntoo, but he was rather a bad drinker (_bad shrāb_). He died in the fight\r\nat Ghaj-dawān.[1106]\r\n\r\nTīngrī-bīrdī the storekeeper (_sāmānchī_) was another; he was a plain\r\n(_turk_), bold, sword-slashing brave. As has been said, he charged out\r\nof the Gate of Balkh on Khusrau Shāh's great retainer Naẕar Bahādur and\r\novercame him (903 AH.).\r\n\r\nThere were a few Turkmān braves also who were received with great favour\r\nwhen they came to the Mīrzā's presence. One of the first to come was\r\n`Alī Khān _Bāyandar_.[1107] Asad Beg and Taham-tan (Strong-bodied) Beg\r\nwere others, an elder and younger brother these; Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā\r\ntook Taham-tan Beg's daughter and by her had Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā. Mīr\r\n`Umar Beg was another; later on he was in Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's\r\nservice; he was a brave, plain, excellent person. His son, Abū'l-fatḥ\r\nby name, came from `Irāq to my presence, a very soft, unsteady and\r\nfeeble person; such a son from such a father!\r\n\r\nOf those who came into Khurāsān after Shāh Ismā`īl took `Irāq and\r\nAẕarbāījān (_circa_ 906 AH.-1500 AD.), one was `Abdu'l-bāqī Mīrzā of\r\nTīmūr Beg's line. He was a Mīrān-shāhī[1108] whose ancestors will have\r\ngone long before into those parts, put thought [Sidenote: Fol. 176.] of\r\nsovereignty out of their heads, served those ruling there, and from them\r\nhave received favour. That Tīmūr `Us̤mān who was the great, trusted beg\r\nof Ya`qūb Beg (_White-sheep Turkmān_) and who had once even thought of\r\nsending against Khurāsān the mass of men he had gathered to himself,\r\nmust have been this `Abdu'l-bāqī Mīrzā's paternal-uncle. Sl. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā took `Abdu'l-bāqī Mīrzā at once into favour, making him a\r\nson-in-law by giving him Sulṯānīm Begīm, the mother of Muḥammad Sl.\r\nMīrzā.[1109] Another late-comer was Murād Beg _Bāyandarī_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. His Chief Justices_ (_ṣadūr_).)\r\n\r\nOne was Mīr Sar-i-barahna (Bare-head)[1110]; he was from a village in\r\nAndijān and appears to have made claim to be a sayyid (_mutasayyid_). He\r\nwas a very agreeable companion, pleasant of temper and speech. His were\r\nthe judgment and rulings that carried weight amongst men of letters and\r\npoets of Khurāsān. He wasted his time by composing, in imitation of the\r\nstory of Amīr Ḥamza,[1111] a work which is one long, far-fetched lie,\r\nopposed to sense and nature.\r\n\r\nKamālu'd-dīn Ḥusain _Gāzur-gāhī_[1112] was another. Though not a Ṣūfī,\r\nhe was mystical.[1113] Such mystics as he will have gathered in\r\n`Alī-sher Beg's presence and there have gone into their raptures and\r\necstacies. Kamālu'd-dīn will have been better-born than most of them;\r\nhis promotion will have been due to his good birth, since he had no\r\nother merit to speak of.[1114] A production of his exists, under the\r\nname _Majālisu'l-`ushshāq_ (Assemblies of lovers), the authorship of\r\nwhich he ascribes (in its preface) to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā.[1115] It is\r\nmostly a lie and a tasteless lie. He has written such irreverent things\r\nin it that some [Sidenote: Fol. 176b.] of them cast doubt upon his\r\northodoxy; for example, he represents the Prophets,—Peace be on\r\nthem,—and Saints as subject to earthly passion, and gives to each a\r\nminion and a mistress. Another and singularly absurd thing is that,\r\nalthough in his preface he says, \"This is Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's own written\r\nword and literary composition,\" he, never-the-less, enters, in the body\r\nof the book, \"All by the sub-signed author\", at the head of odes and\r\nverses well-known to be his own. It was his flattery gave Ẕū'n-nūn\r\n_Arghūn_ the title Lion of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. His wazīrs._)\r\n\r\nOne was Majdu'd-dīn Muḥammad, son of Khwāja Pīr Aḥmad of Khwāf, the one\r\nman (_yak-qalam_) of Shāhrukh Mīrzā's Finance-office.[1116] In Sl.\r\nḤusain Mīrzā's Finance-office there was not at first proper order or\r\nmethod; waste and extravagance resulted; the peasant did not prosper,\r\nand the soldier was not satisfied. Once while Majdu'd-dīn Muḥammad was\r\nstill _parwānchī_[1117] and styled Mīrak (Little Mīr), it became a\r\nmatter of importance to the Mīrzā to have some money; when he asked the\r\nFinance-officials for it, they said none had been collected and that\r\nthere was none. Majdu'd-dīn Muḥammad must have heard this and have\r\nsmiled, for the Mīrzā asked him why he smiled; privacy was made and he\r\ntold Mīrzā what was in his mind. Said he, \"If the honoured Mīrzā will\r\npledge himself to strengthen [Sidenote: Fol. 177.] my hands by not\r\nopposing my orders, it shall so be before long that the country shall\r\nprosper, the peasant be content, the soldier well-off, and the Treasury\r\nfull.\" The Mīrzā for his part gave the pledge desired, put Majdu'd-dīn\r\nMuḥammad in authority throughout Khurāsān, and entrusted all public\r\nbusiness to him. He in his turn by using all possible diligence and\r\neffort, before long had made soldier and peasant grateful and content,\r\nfilled the Treasury to abundance, and made the districts habitable and\r\ncultivated. He did all this however in face of opposition from the begs\r\nand men high in place, all being led by `Alī-sher Beg, all out of temper\r\nwith what Majdu'd-dīn Muḥammad had effected. By their effort and evil\r\nsuggestion he was arrested and dismissed.[1118] In succession to him\r\nNiẕāmu'l-mulk of Khwāf was made Dīwān but in a short time they got him\r\narrested also, and him they got put to death.[1119] They then brought\r\nKhwāja Afẓal out of `Irāq and made him Dīwān; he had just been made a\r\nbeg when I came to Kābul (910 AH.), and he also impressed the Seal in\r\nDīwān.\r\n\r\nKhwāja `Atā[1120] was another; although, unlike those already mentioned,\r\nhe was not in high office or Finance-minister (_dīwān_), nothing was\r\nsettled without his concurrence the whole Khura-sānāt over. He was a\r\npious, praying, upright (_mutadaiyin_) person; he must have been\r\ndiligent in business also.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Others of the Court._)\r\n\r\nThose enumerated were Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's retainers and followers.[1121]\r\nHis was a wonderful Age; in it Khurāsān, and [Sidenote: Fol. 177b.] Herī\r\nabove all, was full of learned and matchless men. Whatever the work a\r\nman took up, he aimed and aspired at bringing that work to perfection.\r\nOne such man was Maulānā `Abdu'r-raḥmān _Jāmī_, who was unrivalled in\r\nhis day for esoteric and exoteric knowledge. Famous indeed are his\r\npoems! The Mullā's dignity it is out of my power to describe; it has\r\noccurred to me merely to mention his honoured name and one atom of his\r\nexcellence, as a benediction and good omen for this part of my humble\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nShaikhu'l-islām Saifu'd-dīn Aḥmad was another. He was of the line of\r\nthat Mullā Sa`du'd-dīn (Mas`ūd) _Taftazānī_[1122] whose descendants from\r\nhis time downwards have given the Shaikhu'l-islām to Khurāsān. He was a\r\nvery learned man, admirably versed in the Arabian sciences[1123] and the\r\nTraditions, most God-fearing and orthodox. Himself a Shafi`ī,[1124] he\r\nwas tolerant of all the sects. People say he never once in 70 years\r\nomitted the Congregational Prayer. He was martyred when Shāh Ismā`īl\r\ntook Herī (916 AH.); there now remains no man of his honoured\r\nline.[1125]\r\n\r\nMaulānā Shaikh Ḥusain was another; he is mentioned here, although his\r\nfirst appearance and his promotion were under Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā,\r\nbecause he was living still under Sl. Ḥusain [Sidenote: Fol. 178.]\r\nMīrzā. Being well-versed in the sciences of philosophy, logic and\r\nrhetoric, he was able to find much meaning in a few words and to bring\r\nit out opportunely in conversation. Being very intimate and influential\r\nwith Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā, he took part in all momentous affairs of the\r\nMīrzā's dominions; there was no better _muḥtasib_[1126]; this will have\r\nbeen why he was so much trusted. Because he had been an intimate of that\r\nMīrzā, the incomparable man was treated with insult in Sl. Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā's time.\r\n\r\nMullā-zāda Mullā `Us̤mān was another. He was a native of Chīrkh, in the\r\nLuhūgur _tūmān_ of the _tūmān_ of Kābul[1127] and was called the Born\r\nMullā (_Mullā-zāda_) because in Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā's time he used to give\r\nlessons when 14 years old. He went to Herī on his way from Samarkand to\r\nmake the circuit of the _ka`ba_, was there stopped, and made to remain\r\nby Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā. He was very learned, the most so of his time.\r\nPeople say he was nearing the rank of Ijtihād[1128] but he did not reach\r\nit. It is said of him that he once asked, \"How should a person forget a\r\nthing heard?\" A strong memory he must have had!\r\n\r\nMīr Jamālu'd-dīn the Traditionalist[1129] was another. He had no equal\r\nin Khurāsān for knowledge of the Muḥammadan Traditions. He was advanced\r\nin years and is still alive (934 to 937 AH.).\r\n\r\nMīr Murtāẓ was another. He was well-versed in the sciences [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 178b.] of philosophy and metaphysics; he was called _murtāẓ_\r\n(ascetic) because he fasted a great deal. He was madly fond of chess, so\r\nmuch so that if he had met two players, he would hold one by the skirt\r\nwhile he played his game out with the other, as much as to say, \"Don't\r\ngo!\"\r\n\r\nMīr Mas`ūd of Sherwān was another.[1130]\r\n\r\nMīr `Abdu'l-ghafūr of Lār was another. Disciple and pupil both of\r\nMaulānā `Abdu'r-raḥmān _Jāmī_, he had read aloud most of the Mullā's\r\npoems (_mas̤nawī_) in his presence, and wrote a plain exposition of the\r\n_Nafaḥāt_.[1131] He had good acquaintance with the exoteric sciences,\r\nand in the esoteric ones also was very successful. He was a curiously\r\ncasual and unceremonious person; no person styled Mullā by any-one\r\nsoever was debarred from submitting a (Qorān) chapter to him for\r\nexposition; moreover whatever the place in which he heard there was a\r\ndarwīsh, he had no rest till he had reached that darwīsh's presence. He\r\nwas ill when I was in Khurāsān (912 AH.); I went to enquire for him\r\nwhere he lay in the Mullā's College,[1132] after I had made the circuit\r\nof the Mullā's tomb. He died a few days later, of that same illness.\r\n\r\nMīr `Atā'u'l-lāh of Mashhad was another.[1133] He knew the Arabian\r\nsciences well and also wrote a Persian treatise on rhyme. That treatise\r\nis well-done but it has the defect that he brings into it, as his\r\nexamples, couplets of his own and, assuming them [Sidenote: Fol. 179.]\r\nto be correct, prefixes to each, \"As must be observed in the following\r\ncouplet by your slave\" (_banda_). Several rivals of his find deserved\r\ncomment in this treatise. He wrote another on the curiosities of verse,\r\nentitled _Badāi`u's-sanāi_; a very well-written treatise. He may have\r\nswerved from the Faith.\r\n\r\nQāẓī Ikhtiyār was another. He was an excellent Qāẓī and wrote a treatise\r\nin Persian on Jurisprudence, an admirable treatise; he also, in order to\r\ngive elucidation (_iqtibās_), made a collection of homonymous verses\r\nfrom the Qorān. He came with Muḥammad-i-yūsuf to see me at the time I\r\nmet the Mīrzās on the Murgh-āb (912 AH.). Talk turning on the Bāburī\r\nscript,[1134] he asked me about it, letter by letter; I wrote it out,\r\nletter by letter; he went through it, letter by letter, and having\r\nlearned its plan, wrote something in it there and then.\r\n\r\nMīr Muḥammad-i-yūsuf was another; he was a pupil of the\r\nShaikhu'l-islām[1135] and afterwards was advanced to his place. In some\r\nassemblies he, in others, Qāẓī Ikhtiyār took the higher place. Towards\r\nthe end of his life he was so infatuated with soldiering and military\r\ncommand, that except of those two tasks, what could be learned from his\r\nconversation? what known from his pen? Though he failed in both, those\r\ntwo ambitions ended by giving to the winds his goods and his life, his\r\nhouse and his home. He may have been a Shī`a.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. The Poets._)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 179b.] The all-surpassing head of the poet-band was\r\nMaulānā `Abdu'r-raḥmān _Jāmī_. Others were Shaikhīm Suhailī and Ḥasan of\r\n`Alī _Jalāīr_[1136] whose names have been mentioned already as in the\r\ncircle of the Mīrzā's begs and household.\r\n\r\nĀṣafī was another,[1137] he taking Āṣafī for his pen-name because he was\r\na wazīr's son. His verse does not want for grace or sentiment, but has\r\nno merit through passion and ecstacy. He himself made the claim, \"I have\r\nnever packed up (_būlmādī_) my odes to make the oasis (_wādī_) of a\r\ncollection.\"[1138] This was affectation, his younger brothers and his\r\nintimates having collected his odes. He wrote little else but odes. He\r\nwaited on me when I went into Khurāsān (912 AH.).\r\n\r\nBanā'i was another; he was a native of Herī and took such a pen-name\r\n(Banā'i) on account of his father Ustād Muḥammad _Sabz-banā_.[1139] His\r\nodes have grace and ecstacy. One poem (_mas̤nawī_) of his on the topic\r\nof fruits, is in the _mutaqārib_ measure;[1140] it is random and not\r\nworked up. Another short poem is in the _khafīf_ measure, so also is a\r\nlonger one finished towards the end of his life. He will have known\r\nnothing of music in his young days and `Alī-sher Beg seems to have\r\ntaunted him about it, so one winter when the Mīrzā, taking `Alī-sher Beg\r\nwith him, went to winter in Merv, Banā'i stayed behind in Herī and so\r\napplied himself to study music that before the heats he had composed\r\nseveral works. These he played and sang, airs with variations, when the\r\nMīrzā came back to Herī in the heats. [Sidenote: Fol. 180.] All amazed,\r\n`Alī-sher Beg praised him. His musical compositions are perfect; one was\r\nan air known as _Nuh-rang_ (Nine modulations), and having both the theme\r\n(_tūkānash_) and the variation (_yīla_) on the note called _rāst_(?).\r\nBanā'i was `Alī-sher Beg's rival; it will have been on this account he\r\nwas so much ill-treated. When at last he could bear it no longer, he\r\nwent into Aẕarbāījān and `Irāq to the presence of Ya'qūb Beg; he did not\r\nremain however in those parts after Ya`qūb Beg's death (896 AH.-1491\r\nAD.) but went back to Herī, just the same with his jokes and retorts.\r\nHere is one of them:—`Alī-sher at a chess-party in stretching his leg\r\ntouched Banā'i on the hinder-parts and said jestingly, \"It is the sad\r\nnuisance of Herī that a man can't stretch his leg without its touching a\r\npoet's backside.\" \"Nor draw it up again,\" retorted Banā'i.[1141] In the\r\nend the upshot of his jesting was that he had to leave Herī again; he\r\nwent then to Samarkand.[1142] A great many good new things used to be\r\nmade for `Alī-sher Beg, so whenever any-one produced a novelty, he\r\ncalled it `Alī-sher's in order to give it credit and vogue.[1143] Some\r\nthings were called after him in compliment _e.g._ because when he had\r\near-ache, he wrapped his head up in one of the blue triangular kerchiefs\r\nwomen tie over their heads in winter, that kerchief was called\r\n`Alī-sher's comforter. Then again, Banā'i when he had decided to leave\r\nHerī, ordered a quite new kind of pad for his ass and [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n180b.] dubbed it `Alī-sher's.\r\n\r\nMaulānā Saifī of Bukhārā was another;[1144] he was a Mullā\r\ncomplete[1145] who in proof of his mullā-ship used to give a list of the\r\nbooks he had read. He put two _dīwāns_ together, one being for the use\r\nof tradesmen (_ḥarfa-kar_), and he also wrote many fables. That he wrote\r\nno _mas̤nawī_ is shewn by the following quatrain:—\r\n\r\n   Though the _mas̤nawī_ be the orthodox verse,\r\n     _I_ know the ode has Divine command;\r\n   Five couplets that charm the heart\r\n     _I_ know to outmatch the Two Quintets.[1146]\r\n\r\nA Persian prosody he wrote is at once brief and prolix, brief in the\r\nsense of omitting things that should be included, and prolix in the\r\nsense that plain and simple matters are detailed down to the diacritical\r\npoints, down even to their Arabic points.[1147] He is said to have been\r\na great drinker, a bad drinker, and a mightily strong-fisted man.\r\n\r\n`Abdu'l-lāh the _mas̤nawī_-writer was another.[1148] He was from Jām and\r\nwas the Mullā's sister's son. Hātifī was his pen-name. He wrote poems\r\n(_mas̤nawī_) in emulation of the Two Quintets,[1149] and called them\r\n_Haft-manẕar_ (Seven-faces) in imitation of the _Haft-paikar_\r\n(Seven-faces). In emulation of the _Sikandar-nāma_ he composed the\r\n_Tīmūr-nāma_. His most renowned _mas̤nawī_ is _Laila and Majnūn_, but\r\nits reputation is greater than its charm.\r\n\r\nMīr Ḥusain the Enigmatist[1150] was another. He seems to have had no\r\nequal in making riddles, to have given his whole time to it, and to have\r\nbeen a curiously humble, disconsolate (_nā-murād_) [Sidenote: Fol. 181.]\r\nand harmless (_bī-bad_) person.\r\n\r\nMīr Muḥammad _Badakhshī_ of Ishkīmīsh was another. As Ishkīmīsh is not\r\nin Badakhshān, it is odd he should have made it his pen-name. His verse\r\ndoes not rank with that of the poets previously mentioned,[1151] and\r\nthough he wrote a treatise on riddles, his riddles are not first-rate.\r\nHe was a very pleasant companion; he waited on me in Samarkand (917\r\nAH.).\r\n\r\nYūsuf the wonderful (_badī_)[1152] was another. He was from the Farghāna\r\ncountry; his odes are said not to be bad.\r\n\r\nĀhī was another, a good ode-writer, latterly in Ibn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā's\r\nservice, and _ṣāḥib-i-dīwān_.[1153]\r\n\r\nMuḥammad _Ṣāliḥ_ was another.[1154] His odes are tasty but\r\nbetter-flavoured than correct. There is Turkī verse of his also, not\r\nbadly written. He went to Shaibāq Khān later on and found complete\r\nfavour. He wrote a Turkī poem (_mas̤nawī_), named from Shaibāq Khān, in\r\nthe _raml masaddas majnūn_ measure, that is to say the metre of the\r\n_Subḥat_.[1155] It is feeble and flat; Muḥammad _Ṣāliḥ_'s reader soon\r\nceases to believe in him.[1156] Here is one of his good couplets:—\r\n\r\n   A fat man (Taṃbal) has gained the land of Farghāna,\r\n   Making Farghāna the house of the fat-man (Taṃbal-khāna).\r\n\r\nFarghāna is known also as Taṃbal-khāna.[1157] I do not know whether the\r\nabove couplet is found in the _mas̤nawī_ mentioned.\r\n\r\nMuḥammad _Ṣāliḥ_ was a very wicked, tyrannical and heartless\r\nperson.[1158]\r\n\r\nMaulānā Shāh Ḥusain _Kāmī_[1159] was another. There are not-bad verses\r\nof his; he wrote odes, and also seems to have put a _dīwān_ together.\r\n\r\nHilālī (New-moon) was another; he is still alive.[1160] Correct and\r\ngraceful though his odes are, they make little impression. There is a\r\n_dīwān_ of his;[1161] and there is also the poem (_mas̤nawī_) in the\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 181b.] _khafīf_ measure, entitled _Shāh and Darwīsh_ of\r\nwhich, fair though many couplets are, the basis and purport are hollow\r\nand bad. Ancient poets when writing of love and the lover, have\r\nrepresented the lover as a man and the beloved as a woman; but Hilālī\r\nhas made the lover a darwīsh, the beloved a king, with the result that\r\nthe couplets containing the king's acts and words, set him forth as\r\nshameless and abominable. It is an extreme effrontery in Hilālī that for\r\na poem's sake he should describe a young man and that young man a king,\r\nas resembling the shameless and immoral.[1162] It is heard-said that\r\nHilālī had a very retentive memory, and that he had by heart 30 or\r\n40,000 couplets, and the greater part of the Two Quintets,—all most\r\nuseful for the minutiae of prosody and the art of verse.\r\n\r\nAhlī[1163] was another; he was of the common people (_`āmī_), wrote\r\nverse not bad, even produced a _dīwān_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Artists._)\r\n\r\nOf fine pen-men there were many; the one standing-out in _nakhsh ta`līq_\r\nwas Sl. `Alī of Mashhad[1164] who copied many books for the Mīrzā and\r\nfor `Alī-sher Beg, writing daily 30 couplets for the first, 20 for the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nOf the painters, one was Bih-zād.[1165] His work was very dainty but he\r\ndid not draw beardless faces well; he used greatly to lengthen the\r\ndouble chin (_ghab-ghab_); bearded faces he drew admirably.\r\n\r\nShāh Muz̤affar was another; he painted dainty portraits, [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n182.] representing the hair very daintily.[1166] Short life was granted\r\nhim; he left the world when on his upward way to fame.\r\n\r\nOf musicians, as has been said, no-one played the dulcimer so well as\r\nKhwāja `Abdu'l-lāh _Marwārīd_.\r\n\r\nQul-i-muḥammad the lutanist (_`aūdī_) was another; he also played the\r\nguitar (_ghichak_) beautifully and added three strings to it. For many\r\nand good preludes (_peshrau_) he had not his equal amongst composers or\r\nperformers, but this is only true of his preludes.\r\n\r\nShaikhī the flautist (_nāyī_) was another; it is said he played also the\r\nlute and the guitar, and that he had played the flute from his 12th or\r\n13th year. He once produced a wonderful air on the flute, at one of\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's assemblies; Qul-i-muḥammad could not reproduce it\r\non the guitar, so declared this a worthless instrument; Shaikhī _Nāyī_\r\nat once took the guitar from Qul-i-muḥammad's hands and played the air\r\non it, well and in perfect tune. They say he was so expert in music that\r\nhaving once heard an air, he was able to say, \"This or that is the tune\r\nof so-and-so's or so-and-so's flute.\"[1167] He composed few works; one\r\nor two airs are heard of.\r\n\r\nShāh Qulī the guitar-player was another; he was of `Irāq, came into\r\nKhurāsān, practised playing, and succeeded. He composed many airs,\r\npreludes and works (_nakhsh, peshrau u aīshlār_).\r\n\r\nḤusain the lutanist was another; he composed and played with taste; he\r\nwould twist the strings of his lute into one and play on that. His fault\r\nwas affectation about playing. He [Sidenote: Fol. 182b.] made a fuss\r\nonce when Shaibāq Khān ordered him to play, and not only played badly\r\nbut on a worthless instrument he had brought in place of his own. The\r\nKhān saw through him at once and ordered him to be well beaten on the\r\nneck, there and then. This was the one good action Shaibāq Khān did in\r\nthe world; it was well-done truly! a worse chastisement is the due of\r\nsuch affected mannikins!\r\n\r\nGhulām-i-shādī (Slave of Festivity), the son of Shādī the reciter, was\r\nanother of the musicians. Though he performed, he did it less well than\r\nthose of the circle just described. There are excellent themes (_ṣūt_)\r\nand beautiful airs (_nakhsh_) of his; no-one in his day composed such\r\nairs and themes. In the end Shaibāq Khān sent him to the Qāzān Khān,\r\nMuḥammad Amīn; no further news has been heard of him.\r\n\r\nMīr Azū was another composer, not a performer; he produced few works but\r\nthose few were in good taste.\r\n\r\nBanā'i was also a musical composer; there are excellent airs and themes\r\nof his.\r\n\r\nAn unrivalled man was the wrestler Muḥammad Bū-sa`īd; he was foremost\r\namongst the wrestlers, wrote verse too, composed themes and airs, one\r\nexcellent air of his being in _chār-gāh_ (four-time),—and he was\r\npleasant company. It is extraordinary that such accomplishments as his\r\nshould be combined with wrestling.[1168]\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NARRATIVE RESUMED.\r\n\r\n(_a. Burial of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā._)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā took his departure from the world, there\r\nwere present of the Mīrzās only Badī'u'z-zamān Mīrzā and\r\nMuz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā. The latter had been his father's favourite\r\nson; his leading beg was Muḥammad Barandūq _Barlās_; his mother Khadīja\r\nBegīm had been the Mīrzā's most influential wife; and to him the\r\nMīrzā's people had gathered. [Sidenote: Fol. 183.] For these reasons\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā had anxieties and thought of not coming,[1169] but\r\nMuz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā and Muḥammad Barandūq Beg themselves rode out,\r\ndispelled his fears and brought him in.\r\n\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā was carried into Herī and there buried in his own\r\nCollege with royal rites and ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. A dual succession._)\r\n\r\nAt this crisis Ẕū'n-nūn Beg was also present. He, Muḥ. Barandūq Beg, the\r\nlate Mīrzā's begs and those of the two (young) Mīrzās having assembled,\r\ndecided to make the two Mīrzās joint-rulers in Herī. Ẕū'n-nūn Beg was to\r\nhave control in Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's Gate, Muḥ. Barandūq Beg, in\r\nMuz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā's. Shaikh `Alī T̤aghāī was to be _dārogha_ in\r\nHerī for the first, Yūsuf-i-`alī for the second. Theirs was a strange\r\nplan! Partnership in rule is a thing unheard of; against it stand Shaikh\r\nSa'dī's words in the Gulistān:—\"Ten darwishes sleep under a blanket\r\n(_gilīm_); two kings find no room in a clime\" (_aqlīm_).[1170]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n912 AH.-MAY 24TH 1506 TO MAY 13TH 1507 AD.[1171]\r\n\r\n(_a. Bābur starts to join Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā._)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of Muḥarram we set out by way of Ghūr-bund [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n183b.] and Shibr-tū to oppose the Aūzbeg.\r\n\r\nAs Jahāngīr Mīrzā had gone out of the country in some sort of\r\ndispleasure, we said, \"There might come much mischief and trouble if he\r\ndrew the clans (_aīmāq_) to himself;\" and \"What trouble might come of\r\nit!\" and, \"First let's get the clans in hand!\" So said, we hurried\r\nforward, riding light and leaving the baggage (_aūrūq_) at Ushtur-shahr\r\nin charge of Walī the treasurer and Daulat-qadam of the scouts. That day\r\nwe reached Fort [Z.]aḥāq; from there we crossed the pass of the\r\nLittle-dome (Guṃbazak-kūtal), trampled through Sāīghān, went over the\r\nDandān-shikan pass and dismounted in the meadow of Kāhmard. From Kāhmard\r\nwe sent Sayyid Afẓal the Seer-of-dreams (_Khwāb-bīn_) and Sl. Muḥammad\r\n_Dūldāī_ to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā with a letter giving the particulars of our\r\nstart from Kābul.[1172]\r\n\r\nJahāngīr Mīrzā must have lagged on the road, for when he got opposite\r\nBāmīān and went with 20 or 30 persons to visit it, he saw near it the\r\ntents of our people left with the baggage. Thinking we were there, he\r\nand his party hurried back to their camp and, without an eye to\r\nanything, without regard for their own people marching in the rear, made\r\noff for Yaka-aūlāng.[1173]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Action of Shaibāq Khān._)\r\n\r\nWhen Shaibāq Khān had laid siege to Balkh, in which was Sl.\r\nQul-i-nachāq,[1174] he sent two or three sulṯāns with 3 or 4000 men to\r\noverrun Badakhshān. At the time Mubārak Shāh and Zubair had again\r\njoined Nāṣir Mīrzā, spite of former resentments and bickerings, and they\r\nall were lying at Shakdān, below Kishm [Sidenote: Fol. 184.] and east of\r\nthe Kishm-water. Moving through the night, one body of Aūzbegs crossed\r\nthat water at the top of the morning and advanced on the Mīrzā; he at\r\nonce drew off to rising-ground, mustered his force, sounded trumpets,\r\nmet and overcame them. Behind the Aūzbegs was the Kishm-water in flood,\r\nmany were drowned in it, a mass of them died by arrow and sword, more\r\nwere made prisoner. Another body of Aūzbegs, sent against Mubārak Shāh\r\nand Zubair where they lay, higher up the water and nearer Kishm, made\r\nthem retire to the rising-ground. Of this the Mīrzā heard; when he had\r\nbeaten off his own assailants, he moved against theirs. So did the\r\nKohistān begs, gathered with horse and foot, still higher up the river.\r\nUnable to make stand against this attack, the Aūzbegs fled, but of this\r\nbody also a mass died by sword, arrow, and water. In all some 1000 to\r\n1500 may have died. This was Nāṣir Mīrzā's one good success; a man of\r\nhis brought us news about it while we were in the dale of Kāhmard.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Bābur moves on into Khurāsān._)\r\n\r\nWhile we were in Kāhmard, our army fetched corn from Ghūrī and Dahāna.\r\nThere too we had letters from Sayyid [Sidenote: Fol. 184b.] Afẓal and\r\nSl. Muḥammad _Dūldāī_ whom we had sent into Khurāsān; their news was of\r\nSl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's death.\r\n\r\nThis news notwithstanding, we set forward for Khurāsān; though there\r\nwere other grounds for doing this, what decided us was anxious thought\r\nfor the reputation of this (Tīmūrid) dynasty. We went up the trough\r\n(_aīchī_) of the Ājar-valley, on over Tūp and Mandaghān, crossed the\r\nBalkh-water and came out on Ṣāf-hill. Hearing there that Aūzbegs were\r\noverrunning Sān and Chār-yak,[1175] we sent a force under Qāsim Beg\r\nagainst them; he got up with them, beat them well, cut many heads off,\r\nand returned.\r\n\r\nWe lay a few days in the meadow of Ṣāf-hill, waiting for news of\r\nJahāngīr Mīrzā and the clans (_aīmāq_) to whom persons had been sent.\r\nWe hunted once, those hills being very full of wild sheep and goats\r\n(_kiyīk_). All the clans came in and waited on me within a few days; it\r\nwas to me they came; they had not gone to Jahāngīr Mīrzā though he had\r\nsent men often enough to them, once sending even `Imādu'd-dīn Mas`ūd. He\r\nhimself was forced to come at last; he saw me at the foot of the valley\r\nwhen I came down off Ṣāf-hill. Being anxious about Khurāsān, we neither\r\npaid him attention nor took thought for the clans, but went right on\r\nthrough Gurzwān, Almār, Qaiṣār, Chīchīk-tū, and Fakhru'd-dīn's-death\r\n(_aūlūm_) into the Bām-valley, [Sidenote: Fol. 185.] one of the\r\ndependencies of Bādghīs.\r\n\r\nThe world being full of divisions,[1176] things were being taken from\r\ncountry and people with the long arm; we ourselves began to take\r\nsomething, by laying an impost on the Turks and clans of those parts, in\r\ntwo or three months taking perhaps 300 _tūmāns_ of _kipkī_.[1177]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Coalition of the Khurāsān Mīrzās._)\r\n\r\nA few days before our arrival (in Bām-valley?) some of the Khurāsān\r\nlight troops and of Ẕū'n-nūn Beg's men had well beaten Aūzbeg raiders in\r\nPand-dih (Panj-dih?) and Marūchāq, killing a mass of men.[1178]\r\n\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā and Muz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā with Muḥammad Barandūq\r\n_Barlās_, Ẕū'n-nūn _Arghūn_ and his son Shāh Beg resolved to move on\r\nShaibāq Khān, then besieging Sl. Qul-i-nachāq (?) in Balkh. Accordingly\r\nthey summoned all Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's sons, and got out of Herī to effect\r\ntheir purpose. At Chihil-dukhtarān Abū'l-muḥsin M. joined them from\r\nMarv; Ibn-i-ḥusain M. followed, coming up from Tūn and Qāīn. Kūpuk\r\n(Kīpik) M. was in Mashhad; often though they sent to him, he behaved\r\nunmanly, spoke senseless words, and did not come. Between him and\r\nMuz̤affar Mīrzā, there was jealousy; when Muz̤affar M. was made\r\n(joint-)ruler, he said, \"How should _I_ go to _his_ presence?\" Through\r\nthis disgusting jealousy he did not come now, even at this crisis when\r\nall his brethren, older and younger, were assembling in concord,\r\nresolute against such a foe [Sidenote: Fol. 185b.] as Shaibāq Khān.\r\nKūpuk M. laid his own absence to rivalry, but everybody else laid it to\r\nhis cowardice. One word! In this world acts such as his outlive the man;\r\nif a man have any share of intelligence, why try to be ill-spoken of\r\nafter death? if he be ambitious, why not try so to act that, he gone,\r\nmen will praise him? In the honourable mention of their names, wise men\r\nfind a second life!\r\n\r\nEnvoys from the Mīrzās came to me also, Mūh. Barandūq _Barlās_ himself\r\nfollowing them. As for me, what was to hinder my going? It was for that\r\nvery purpose I had travelled one or two hundred _yīghāch_ (500-600\r\nmiles)! I at once started with Muḥ. Barandūq Beg for Murgh-āb[1179]\r\nwhere the Mīrzās were lying.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Bābur meets the Mīrzās._)\r\n\r\nThe meeting with the Mīrzās was on Monday the 8th of the latter Jumāda\r\n(Oct. 26th 1506 AH.). Abū'l-muḥsin Mīrzā came out a mile to meet me; we\r\napproached one another; on my side, I dismounted, on his side, he; we\r\nadvanced, saw one another and remounted. Near the camp Muz̤affar Mīrzā\r\nand Ibn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā met us; they, being younger than Abū'l-muḥsin\r\nMīrzā ought to have come out further than he to meet me.[1180] Their\r\ndilatoriness may not have been due to pride, but to heaviness [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 186.] after wine; their negligence may have been no slight on me,\r\nbut due to their own social pleasures. On this Muz̤affar Mīrzā laid\r\nstress;[1181] we two saw one another without dismounting, so did\r\nIbn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā and I. We rode on together and, in an amazing crowd\r\nand press, dismounted at Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's Gate. Such was the\r\nthrong that some were lifted off the ground for three or four steps\r\ntogether, while others, wishing for some reason to get out, were\r\ncarried, willy-nilly, four or five steps the other way.\r\n\r\nWe reached Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's Audience-tent. It had been agreed that\r\nI, on entering, should bend the knee (_yūkūnghāī_) once, that the Mīrzā\r\nshould rise and advance to the edge of the estrade,[1182] and that we\r\nshould see one another there. I went in, bent the knee once, and was\r\ngoing right forward; the Mīrzā rose rather languidly and advanced rather\r\nslowly; Qāsim Beg, as he was my well-wisher and held my reputation as\r\nhis own, gave my girdle a tug; I understood, moved more slowly, and so\r\nthe meeting was on the appointed spot.\r\n\r\nFour divans (_tūshuk_) had been placed in the tent. Always in the\r\nMīrzā's tents one side was like a gate-way[1183] and at the edge of this\r\ngate-way he always sat. A divan was set there now [Sidenote: Fol. 186b.]\r\non which he and Muz̤affar Mīrzā sat together. Abū'l-muḥsin, Mīrzā and I\r\nsat on another, set in the right-hand place of honour (_tūr_). On\r\nanother, to Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's left, sat Ibn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā with\r\nQāsim Sl. _Aūzbeg_, a son-in-law of the late Mīrzā and father of\r\nQāsim-i-ḥusain Sulṯān. To my right and below my divan was one on which\r\nsat Jahāngīr Mīrzā and `Abdu'r-razzāq Mīrzā. To the left of Qāsim Sl.\r\nand Ibn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā, but a good deal lower, were Muḥ. Barandūq Beg,\r\nẔū'n-nūn Beg and Qāsim Beg.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was not a social gathering, cooked viands were brought in,\r\ndrinkables[1184] were set with the food, and near them gold and silver\r\ncups. Our forefathers through a long space of time, had respected the\r\nChīngīz-tūrā (ordinance), doing nothing opposed to it, whether in\r\nassembly or Court, in sittings-down or risings-up. Though it has not\r\nDivine authority so that a man obeys it of necessity, still good rules\r\nof conduct must be obeyed by whom-soever they are left; just in the same\r\nway that, if a forefather have done ill, his ill must be changed for\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal I rode from the Mīrzā's camp some 2 miles to [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 187.] our own dismounting-place.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Bābur claims due respect._)\r\n\r\nAt my second visit Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā shewed me less respect than at\r\nmy first. I therefore had it said to Muḥ. Barandūq Beg and to Ẕū'n-nūn\r\nBeg that, small though my age was (_aet._ 24), my place of honour was\r\nlarge; that I had seated myself twice on the throne of our forefathers\r\nin Samarkand by blow straight-dealt; and that to be laggard in shewing\r\nme respect was unreasonable, since it was for this (Tīmūrid) dynasty's\r\nsake I had thus fought and striven with that alien foe. This said, and\r\nas it was reasonable, they admitted their mistake at once and shewed the\r\nrespect claimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Bābur's temperance._)\r\n\r\nThere was a wine-party (_chāghīr-majlisī_) once when I went after the\r\nMid-day Prayer to Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's presence. At that time I drank\r\nno wine. The party was altogether elegant; every sort of relish to wine\r\n(_gazak_) was set out on the napery, with brochettes of fowl and goose,\r\nand all sorts of viands. The Mīrzā's entertainments were much renowned;\r\ntruly was this one free from the pang of thirst (_bī ghall_), reposeful\r\nand tranquil. I was at two or three of his wine-parties while we were on\r\nthe bank of the Murgh-āb; once it was known I did not drink, no pressure\r\nto do so was put on me.\r\n\r\nI went to one wine-party of Muz̤affar Mīrzā's. Ḥusain of `Alī _Jalāīr_\r\nand Mīr Badr were both there, they being in his service. When Mīr Badr\r\nhad had enough (_kaifīyat_), he danced, [Sidenote: Fol. 187b.] and\r\ndanced well what seemed to be his own invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Comments on the Mīrzās._)\r\n\r\nThree months it took the Mīrzās to get out of Herī, agree amongst\r\nthemselves, collect troops, and reach Murgh-āb. Meantime Sl.\r\nQul-i-nachāq (?), reduced to extremity, had surrendered Balkh to the\r\nAūzbeg but that Aūzbeg, hearing of our alliance against him, had hurried\r\nback to Samarkand. The Mīrzās were good enough as company and in social\r\nmatters, in conversation and parties, but they were strangers to war,\r\nstrategy, equipment, bold fight and encounter.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Winter plans._)\r\n\r\nWhile we were on the Murgh-āb, news came that Ḥaq-naẕīr _Chapā_ (var.\r\nḤiān) was over-running the neighbourhood of Chīchīk-tū with 4 or 500\r\nmen. All the Mīrzās there present, do what they would, could not manage\r\nto send a light troop against those raiders! It is 10 _yīghāch_ (50-55\r\nm.) from Murgh-āb to Chīchīk-tū. I asked the work; they, with a thought\r\nfor their own reputation, would not give it to me.\r\n\r\nThe year being almost at an end when Shaibāq Khān retired, the Mīrzās\r\ndecided to winter where it was convenient and to reassemble next summer\r\nin order to repel their foe.\r\n\r\nThey pressed me to winter in Khurāsān, but this not one of my\r\nwell-wishers saw it good for me to do because, while Kābul and Ghaznī\r\nwere full of a turbulent and ill-conducted medley of [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n188.] people and hordes, Turks, Mughūls, clans and nomads (_aīmāq u\r\naḥsham_), Afghāns and Hazāra, the roads between us and that not yet\r\ndesirably subjected country of Kābul were, one, the mountain-road, a\r\nmonth's journey even without delay through snow or other cause,—the\r\nother, the low-country road, a journey of 40 or 50 days.\r\n\r\nConsequently we excused ourselves to the Mīrzās, but they would accept\r\nno excuse and, for all our pleas, only urged the more. In the end\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā, Abū'l-muḥsin Mīrzā and Muz̤affar Mīrzā themselves\r\nrode to my tent and urged me to stay the winter. It was impossible to\r\nrefuse men of such ruling position, come in person to press us to stay\r\non. Besides this, the whole habitable world has not such a town as Herī\r\nhad become under Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, whose orders and efforts had\r\nincreased its splendour and beauty as ten to one, rather, as twenty to\r\none. As I greatly wished to stay, I consented to do so.\r\n\r\nAbū'l-muḥsin M. went to Marv, his own district; Ibn-i-ḥusain M. went to\r\nhis, Tūn and Qāīn; Badī`u'z-zamān M. and Muz̤affar M. set off for Herī;\r\nI followed them a few days later, taking the road by Chihil-dukhtarān\r\nand Tāsh-rabāṯ.[1185]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Bābur visits the Begīms in Herī._)\r\n\r\nAll the Begīms, _i.e._ my paternal-aunt Pāyanda-sulṯān Begīm, Khadīja\r\nBegīm, Apāq Begīm, and my other paternal-aunt Begīms, daughters of Sl.\r\nAbū-sa`īd Mīrzā,[1186] were gathered together, at the time I went to see\r\nthem, in Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's College at his [Sidenote: Fol. 188b.]\r\nMausoleum. Having bent the knee with (_yūkūnūb bīla_) Pāyanda-sulṯān\r\nBegīm first of all, I had an interview with her; next, not bending the\r\nknee,[1187] I had an interview with Apāq Begīm; next, having bent the\r\nknee with Khadīja Begīm, I had an interview with her. After sitting\r\nthere for some time during recitation of the Qorān,[1188] we went to the\r\nSouth College where Khadīja Begīm's tents had been set up and where food\r\nwas placed before us. After partaking of this, we went to Pāyanda-sulṯān\r\nBegīm's tents and there spent the night.\r\n\r\nThe New-year's Garden was given us first for a camping-ground; there our\r\ncamp was arranged; and there I spent the night of the day following my\r\nvisit to the Begīms, but as I did not find it a convenient place,\r\n`Alī-sher Beg's residence was assigned to me, where I was as long as I\r\nstayed in Herī, every few days shewing myself in Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's\r\npresence in the World-adorning Garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. The Mīrzās entertain Bābur in Herī._)\r\n\r\nA few days after Muz̤affar Mīrzā had settled down in the White-garden,\r\nhe invited me to his quarters; Khadīja Begīm was also there, and with me\r\nwent Jahāngīr Mīrzā. When we had eaten a meal in the Begīm's\r\npresence,[1189] Muz̤affar Mīrzā took me to where there was a wine-party,\r\nin the T̤arab-khāna (Joy-house) built by Bābur Mīrzā, a sweet little\r\nabode, a smallish, two-storeyed house in the middle of a smallish\r\ngarden. Great pains have been taken with its upper storey; this has a\r\nretreat (_ḥujra_) in each of its four corners, the space between each\r\ntwo retreats being like a _shāh-nīshīn_[1190]; in between these retreats\r\nand [Sidenote: Fol. 189.] _shāh-nīshīns_ is one large room on all sides\r\nof which are pictures which, although Bābur Mīrzā built the house, were\r\ncommanded by Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā and depict his own wars and encounters.\r\n\r\nTwo divans had been set in the north _shāh-nīshīn_, facing each other,\r\nand with their sides turned to the north. On one Muz̤affar Mīrzā and I\r\nsat, on the other Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā[1191] and Jahāngīr Mīrzā. We being\r\nguests, Muz̤affar Mīrzā gave me place above himself. The social cups\r\nwere filled, the cup-bearers ordered to carry them to the guests; the\r\nguests drank down the mere wine as if it were water-of-life; when it\r\nmounted to their heads, the party waxed warm.\r\n\r\nThey thought to make me also drink and to draw me into their own circle.\r\nThough up till then I had not committed the sin of wine-drinking[1192]\r\nand known the cheering sensation of comfortable drunkenness, I was\r\ninclined to drink wine and my heart was drawn to cross that stream\r\n(_wāda_). I had had no inclination for wine in my childhood; I knew\r\nnothing of its cheer and pleasure. If, as sometimes, my father pressed\r\nwine on me, I excused myself; I did not commit the sin. After he\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 189b.] died, Khwāja Qāẓī's right guidance kept me\r\nguiltless; as at that time I abstained from forbidden viands, what room\r\nwas there for the sin of wine? Later on when, with the young man's lusts\r\nand at the prompting of sensual passion, desire for wine arose, there\r\nwas no-one to press it on me, no-one indeed aware of my leaning towards\r\nit; so that, inclined for it though my heart was, it was difficult of\r\nmyself to do such a thing, one thitherto undone. It crossed my mind now,\r\nwhen the Mīrzās were so pressing and when too we were in a town so\r\nrefined as Herī, \"Where should I drink if not here? here where all the\r\nchattels and utensils of luxury and comfort are gathered and in use.\" So\r\nsaying to myself, I resolved to drink wine; I determined to cross that\r\nstream; but it occurred to me that as I had not taken wine in\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's house or from his hand, who was to me as an elder\r\nbrother, things might find way into his mind if I took wine in his\r\nyounger brother's house and from his hand. Having so said to myself, I\r\nmentioned my doubt and difficulty. Said they, \"Both the excuse and the\r\nobstacle are reasonable,\" pressed me no more to drink then but settled\r\nthat when I was in company with both Mīrzās, I should drink under the\r\ninsistance of both.\r\n\r\nAmongst the musicians present at this party were Ḥāfiẓ Ḥājī, [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 190.] Jalālu'd-dīn Maḥmūd the flautist, and Ghulām _shādī_'s\r\nyounger brother, Ghulām _bacha_ the Jews'-harpist. Ḥāfiẓ Ḥājī sang well,\r\nas Herī people sing, quietly, delicately, and in tune. With Jahāngīr\r\nMīrzā was a Samarkandī singer Mīr Jān whose singing was always loud,\r\nharsh and out-of-tune. The Mīrzā, having had enough, ordered him to\r\nsing; he did so, loudly, harshly and without taste. Khurāsānīs have\r\nquite refined manners; if, under this singing, one did stop his ears,\r\nthe face of another put question, not one could stop the singer, out of\r\nconsideration for the Mīrzā.\r\n\r\nAfter the Evening Prayer we left the T̤arab-khāna for a new house in\r\nMuz̤affar Mīrzā's winter-quarters. There Yūsuf-i-`alī danced in the\r\ndrunken time, and being, as he was, a master in music, danced well. The\r\nparty waxed very warm there. Muz̤affar Mīrzā gave me a sword-belt, a\r\nlambskin surtout, and a grey _tīpūchāq_ (horse). Jānak recited in\r\nTurkī. Two slaves of the Mīrzā's, known as Big-moon and Little-moon, did\r\noffensive, drunken tricks in the drunken time. The party was warm till\r\nnight when those assembled scattered, I, however, staying the night in\r\nthat house.\r\n\r\nQāsim Beg getting to hear that I had been pressed to drink wine, sent\r\nsome-one to Ẕū'n-nūn Beg with advice for him and for Muz̤affar Mīrzā,\r\ngiven in very plain words; the result was [Sidenote: Fol. 190b.] that\r\nthe Mīrzās entirely ceased to press wine upon me.\r\n\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā, hearing that Muz̤affar M. had entertained me,\r\nasked me to a party arranged in the Maqauwī-khāna of the World-adorning\r\nGarden. He asked also some of my close circle[1193] and some of our\r\nbraves. Those about me could never drink (openly) on my own account; if\r\nthey ever did drink, they did it perhaps once in 40 days, with doorstrap\r\nfast and under a hundred fears. Such as these were now invited; here too\r\nthey drank with a hundred precautions, sometimes calling off my\r\nattention, sometimes making a screen of their hands, notwithstanding\r\nthat I had given them permission to follow common custom, because this\r\nparty was given by one standing to me as a father or elder brother.\r\nPeople brought in weeping-willows....[1194]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this party they set a roast goose before me but as I was no carver or\r\ndisjointer of birds, I left it alone. \"Do you not like it?\" inquired the\r\nMīrzā. Said I, \"I am a poor carver.\" On this he at once disjointed the\r\nbird and set it again before [Sidenote: Fol. 191.] me. In such matters\r\nhe had no match. At the end of the party he gave me an enamelled\r\nwaist-dagger, a _chār-qāb_,[1195] and a _tīpūchāq_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Bābur sees the sights of Herī._)\r\n\r\nEvery day of the time I was in Herī I rode out to see a new sight; my\r\nguide in these excursions was Yūsuf-i-`alī Kūkūldāsh; wherever we\r\ndismounted, he set food before me. Except Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's Almshouse,\r\nnot one famous spot, maybe, was left unseen in those 40 days.\r\n\r\nI saw the Gāzur-gāh,[1196] `Alī-sher's Bāghcha (Little-garden), the\r\nPaper-mortars,[1197] Takht-astāna (Royal-residence), Pul-i-gāh,\r\nKahad-stān,[1198] Naẕar-gāh-garden, Ni`matābād (Pleasure-place),\r\nGāzur-gāh Avenue, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā's Ḥaẕirat,[1199] Takht-i-safar,[1200]\r\nTakht-i-nawā'ī, Takht-i-barkar, Takht-i-Ḥājī Beg, Takht-i-Bahā'u'd-dīn\r\n`Umar, Takht-i-Shaikh Zainu'd-dīn, Maulānā `Abdu'r-raḥmān _Jāmī_'s\r\nhonoured shrine and tomb,[1201] Namāz-gāh-i-mukhtār,[1202] the\r\nFish-pond,[1203] Sāq-i-sulaimān,[1204] Bulūrī (Crystal) which\r\noriginally may have been Abū'l-walīd,[1205] Imām Fakhr,[1206]\r\nAvenue-garden, Mīrzā's Colleges and tomb, Guhār-shād Begīm's College,\r\ntomb,[1207] and Congregational Mosque, the Ravens'-garden, New-garden,\r\nZubaida-garden,[1208] Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā's White-house [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n191b.] outside the `Iraq-gate, Pūrān,[1209] the Archer's-seat, Chargh\r\n(hawk)-meadow, Amīr Wāḥid,[1210] Mālān-bridge,[1211] Khwāja-tāq,[1212]\r\nWhite-garden, T̤arab-khāna, Bāgh-i-jahān-ārā, Kūshk,[1213]\r\nMaqauwī-khāna, Lily-house, Twelve-towers, the great tank to the north of\r\nJahān-ārā and the four dwellings on its four sides, the five Fort-gates,\r\n_viz._ the Malik, `Irāq, Fīrūzābād, Khūsh[1214] and Qībchāq Gates,\r\nChārsū, Shaikhu'l-islām's College, Maliks' Congregational Mosque,\r\nTown-garden, Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's College on the bank of the\r\nAnjīl-canal, `Alī-sher Beg's dwellings where we resided and which people\r\ncall Unsīya (Ease), his tomb and mosque which they call Qudsīya (Holy),\r\nhis College and Almshouse which they call Khalāṣīya and Akhlāṣīya\r\n(Freedom and Sincerity), his Hot-bath and Hospital which they call\r\nṢafā'īya and Shafā'īya. All these I visited in that space of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Bābur engages Ma`ṣūma-sulṯān in marriage._)\r\n\r\nIt must have been before those throneless times[1215] that Ḥabība-sulṯān\r\nBegīm, the mother of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā's youngest daughter Ma`ṣūma-sulṯān\r\nBegīm, brought her daughter into Herī. One day when I was visiting my\r\nĀkā, Ma`ṣūma-sulṯān Begīm came there with her mother and at once felt\r\narise in her a great inclination towards me. Private messengers having\r\nbeen sent, my Ākā and my Yīnkā, as I used to call Pāyanda-sulṯān Begīm\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 192.] and Habība-sulṯān Begīm, settled between them that\r\nthe latter should bring her daughter after me to Kābul.[1216]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. Bābur leaves Khurāsān._)\r\n\r\nVery pressingly had Muḥ Barandūq Beg and Ẕū'n-nūn _Arghūn_ said, \"Winter\r\nhere!\" but they had given me no winter-quarters nor had they made any\r\nwinter-arrangements for me. Winter came on; snow fell on the mountains\r\nbetween us and Kābul; anxiety grew about Kābul; no winter-quarters were\r\noffered, no arrangements made! As we could not speak out, of necessity\r\nwe left Herī!\r\n\r\nOn the pretext of finding winter-quarters, we got out of the town on the\r\n7th day of the month of Sha`bān (Dec. 24th 1506 AD.), and went to near\r\nBādghīs. Such were our slowness and our tarryings that the Ramẓān-moon\r\nwas seen a few marches only beyond the Langar of Mir Ghiyāṣ.[1217] Of\r\nour braves who were absent on various affairs, some joined us, some\r\nfollowed us into Kābul 20 days or a month later, some stayed in Herī and\r\ntook service with the Mīrzās. One of these last was Sayyidīm `Alī the\r\ngate-ward, who became Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā's retainer. To no servant of\r\nKhusrau Shāh had I shewn so much favour as to him; he had been given\r\nGhaznī when Jahāngīr Mīrzā abandoned it, and in it when he came away\r\nwith the army, had left his younger brother Dost-i-anjū (?) Shaikh.\r\nThere were in truth [Sidenote: Fol. 192b.] no better men amongst Khusrau\r\nShāh's retainers than this man Sayyidīm `Alī the gate-ward and\r\nMuḥibb-i-`alī the armourer. Sayyidīm was of excellent nature and\r\nmanners, a bold swordsman, a singularly competent and methodical man.\r\nHis house was never without company and assembly; he was greatly\r\ngenerous, had wit and charm, a variety of talk and story, and was a\r\nsweet-natured, good-humoured, ingenious, fun-loving person. His fault\r\nwas that he practised vice and pederasty. He may have swerved from the\r\nFaith; may also have been a hypocrite in his dealings; some of what\r\nseemed double-dealing people attributed to his jokes, but, still, there\r\nmust have been a something![1218] When Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā had let\r\nShaibāq Khān take Herī and had gone to Shāh Beg (_Arghūn_), he had\r\nSayyidīm `Alī thrown into the Harmand because of his double-dealing\r\nwords spoken between the Mīrzā and Shāh Beg. Muḥibb-i-`alī's story will\r\ncome into the narrative of events hereafter to be written.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. A perilous mountain-journey._)\r\n\r\nFrom the Langar of Mīr Ghiyās̤ we had ourselves guided past the\r\nborder-villages of Gharjistān to Chach-charān.[1219] From the almshouse\r\nto Gharjistān was an unbroken sheet of snow; it was deeper further on;\r\nnear Chach-charān itself it was above the horses' knees. Chach-charān\r\ndepended on Ẕū'n-nūn _Arghūn_; his retainer Mīr Jān-aīrdī was in it now;\r\nfrom him we took, on payment, the whole of Ẕū'n-nūn Beg's store of\r\nprovisions. A march or two further on, the snow was very deep, being\r\nabove [Sidenote: Fol. 193.] the stirrup, indeed in many places the\r\nhorses' feet did not touch the ground.\r\n\r\nWe had consulted at the Langar of Mīr Ghiyās̤ which road to take for\r\nreturn to Kābul; most of us agreed in saying, \"It is winter, the\r\nmountain-road is difficult and dangerous; the Qandahār road, though a\r\nlittle longer, is safe and easy.\" Qāsim Beg said, \"That road is long;\r\nyou will go by this one.\" As he made much dispute, we took the\r\nmountain-road.\r\n\r\nOur guide was a Pashāī named Pīr Sulṯān (Old sultan?). Whether it was\r\nthrough old age, whether from want of heart, whether because of the deep\r\nsnow, he lost the road and could not guide us. As we were on this route\r\nunder the insistance of Qāsim Beg, he and his sons, for his name's sake,\r\ndismounted, trampled the snow down, found the road again and took the\r\nlead. One day the snow was so deep and the way so uncertain that we\r\ncould not go on; there being no help for it, back we turned, dismounted\r\nwhere there was fuel, picked out 60 or 70 good men and sent them down\r\nthe valley in our tracks to fetch any one soever of the Hazāra,\r\nwintering in the valley-bottom, who might shew us the road. That place\r\ncould not be left till our men returned three or four days later. They\r\nbrought no [Sidenote: Fol. 193b.] guide; once more we sent Sulṯān\r\n_Pashāī_ ahead and, putting our trust in God, again took the road by\r\nwhich we had come back from where it was lost. Much misery and hardship\r\nwere endured in those few days, more than at any time of my life. In\r\nthat stress I composed the following opening couplet:—\r\n\r\n   Is there one cruel turn of Fortune's wheel unseen of me?\r\n   Is there a pang, a grief my wounded heart has missed?\r\n\r\nWe went on for nearly a week, trampling down the snow and not getting\r\nforward more than two or three miles a day. I was one of the\r\nsnow-stampers, with 10 or 15 of my household, Qāsim Beg, his sons\r\nTīngrī-bīrdī and Qaṃbar-i-`alī and two or three of their retainers.\r\nThese mentioned used to go forward for 7 or 8 yards, stamping the snow\r\ndown and at each step sinking to the waist or the breast. After a few\r\nsteps the leading man would stand still, exhausted by the labour, and\r\nanother would go forward. By the time 10, 15, 20, men on foot had\r\nstamped the snow down, it became so that a horse might be led over it. A\r\nhorse would be led, would sink to the stirrups, could do no more than 10\r\nor 12 steps, and would be drawn aside to let another go on. After we,\r\n10, 15, 20, men had stamped down the snow and had led horses forward in\r\nthis fashion, very serviceable [Sidenote: Fol. 194.] braves and men of\r\nrenowned name would enter the beaten track, hanging their heads. It was\r\nnot a time to urge or compel! the man with will and hardihood for such\r\ntasks does them by his own request! Stamping the snow down in this way,\r\nwe got out of that afflicting place (_ānjūkān yīr_) in three or four\r\ndays to a cave known as the Khawāl-i-qūtī (Blessed-cave), below the\r\nZirrīn-pass.\r\n\r\nThat night the snow fell in such an amazing blizzard of cutting wind\r\nthat every man feared for his life. The storm had become extremely\r\nviolent by the time we reached the _khawāl_, as people in those parts\r\ncall a mountain-cave (_ghar_) or hollow (_khāwāk_). We dismounted at its\r\nmouth. Deep snow! a one-man road! and even on that stamped-down and\r\ntrampled road, pitfalls for horses! the days at their shortest! The\r\nfirst arrivals reached the cave by daylight; others kept coming in from\r\nthe Evening Prayer till the Bed-time one; later than that people\r\ndismounted wherever they happened to be; dawn shot with many still in\r\nthe saddle.\r\n\r\nThe cave seeming to be rather small, I took a shovel and shovelled out a\r\nplace near its mouth, the size of a sitting-mat [Sidenote: Fol. 194b.]\r\n(_takiya-namad_), digging it out breast-high but even then not reaching\r\nthe ground. This made me a little shelter from the wind when I sat right\r\ndown in it. I did not go into the cave though people kept saying, \"Come\r\ninside,\" because this was in my mind, \"Some of my men in snow and storm,\r\nI in the comfort of a warm house! the whole horde (_aūlūs_) outside in\r\nmisery and pain, I inside sleeping at ease! That would be far from a\r\nman's act, quite another matter than comradeship! Whatever hardship and\r\nwretchedness there is, I will face; what strong men stand, I will stand;\r\nfor, as the Persian proverb says, to die with friends is a nuptial.\"\r\nTill the Bed-time Prayer I sat through that blizzard of snow and wind in\r\nthe dug-out, the snow-fall being such that my head, back, and ears were\r\noverlaid four hands thick. The cold of that night affected my ears. At\r\nthe Bed-time Prayer some-one, looking more carefully at the cave,\r\nshouted out, \"It is a very roomy cave with place for every-body.\" On\r\nhearing this I shook off my roofing of snow and, asking the braves near\r\nto come also, went inside. There was room for 50 or 60! People brought\r\nout their rations, cold meat, parched grain, whatever they had. From\r\nsuch cold and tumult to a place so warm, cosy and quiet![1220]\r\n\r\nNext day the snow and wind having ceased, we made an early start and we\r\ngot to the pass by again stamping down [Sidenote: Fol. 195.] a road in\r\nthe snow. The proper road seems to make a détour up the flank of the\r\nmountain and to go over higher up, by what is understood to be called\r\nthe Zirrīn-pass. Instead of taking that road, we went straight up the\r\nvalley-bottom (_qūl_).[1221] It was night before we reached the further\r\nside of the (Bakkak-)pass; we spent the night there in the mouth of the\r\nvalley, a night of mighty cold, got through with great distress and\r\nsuffering. Many a man had his hands and feet frost-bitten; that night's\r\ncold took both Kīpa's feet, both Sīūndūk _Turkmān_'s hands, both Āhī's\r\nfeet. Early next morning we moved down the valley; putting our trust in\r\nGod, we went straight down, by bad slopes and sudden falls, knowing and\r\nseeing it could not be the right way. It was the Evening Prayer when we\r\ngot out of that valley. No long-memoried old man knew that any-one had\r\nbeen heard of as crossing that pass with the snow so deep, or indeed\r\nthat it had ever entered the heart of man to cross it at that time of\r\nyear. Though for a few days we had suffered greatly through the depth of\r\nthe snow, yet its depth, in the end, enabled us to reach our\r\ndestination. For why? How otherwise should we have traversed those\r\npathless slopes and sudden falls? [Sidenote: Fol. 195b.]\r\n\r\n   All ill, all good in the count, is gain if looked at aright!\r\n\r\nThe Yaka-aūlāng people at once heard of our arrival and our dismounting;\r\nfollowed, warm houses, fat sheep, grass and horse-corn, water without\r\nstint, ample wood and dried dung for fires! To escape from such snow and\r\ncold to such a village, to such warm dwellings, was comfort those will\r\nunderstand who have had our trials, relief known to those who have felt\r\nour hardships. We tarried one day in Yaka-aūlāng, happy-of-heart and\r\neasy-of-mind; marched 2 _yīghāch_ (10-12 m.) next day and dismounted.\r\nThe day following was the Ramẓān Feast[1222]; we went on through Bāmīān,\r\ncrossed by Shibr-tū and dismounted before reaching Janglīk.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. Second raid on the Turkmān Hazāras._)\r\n\r\nThe Turkmān Hazāras with their wives and little children must have made\r\ntheir winter-quarters just upon our road[1223]; they had no word about\r\nus; when we got in amongst their cattle-pens and tents (_alāchūq_) two\r\nor three groups of these went to ruin and plunder, the people themselves\r\ndrawing off with their little children and abandoning houses and goods.\r\nNews was [Sidenote: Fol. 196.] brought from ahead that, at a place where\r\nthere were narrows, a body of Hazāras was shooting arrows, holding up\r\npart of the army, and letting no-one pass. We, hurrying on, arrived to\r\nfind no narrows at all; a few Hazāras were shooting from a naze,\r\nstanding in a body on the hill[1224] like very good soldiers.[1225]\r\n\r\n   They saw the blackness of the foe;\r\n     Stood idle-handed and amazed;\r\n   I arriving, went swift that way,\r\n     Pressed on with shout, \"Move on! move on!\"\r\n   I wanted to hurry my men on,\r\n     To make them stand up to the foe.\r\n   With a \"Hurry up!\" to my men,\r\n     I went on to the front.\r\n   Not a man gave ear to my words.\r\n     I had no armour nor horse-mail nor arms,\r\n   I had but my arrows and quiver.\r\n     I went, the rest, maybe all of them, stood,\r\n   Stood still as if slain by the foe!\r\n     Your servant you take that you may have use\r\n   Of his arms, of his life, the whole time;\r\n     Not that the servant stand still\r\n   While the beg makes advance to the front;\r\n     Not that the servant take rest\r\n   While his beg is making the rounds.\r\n     From no such a servant will come\r\n   Speed, or use in your Gate, or zest for your food.\r\n     At last I charged forward myself,\r\n   [Sidenote: Fol. 196b.] Herding the foe up the hill;\r\n     Seeing me go, my men also moved,\r\n   Leaving their terrors behind.\r\n     With me they swift spread over the slope,\r\n   Moving on without heed to the shaft;\r\n     Sometimes on foot, mounted sometimes,\r\n   Boldly we ever moved on,\r\n     Still from the hill poured the shafts.\r\n   Our strength seen, the foe took to flight.\r\n     We got out on the hill; we drove the Hazāras,\r\n   Drove them like deer by valley and ridge;\r\n     We shot those wretches like deer;\r\n   We shared out the booty in goods and in sheep;\r\n     The Turkmān Hazāras' kinsfolk we took;\r\n   We made captive their people of sorts (_qarā_);\r\n     We laid hands on their men of renown;\r\n   Their wives and their children we took.\r\n\r\nI myself collected a few of the Hazāras' sheep, gave them into Yārak\r\nT̤aghāī's charge, and went to the front. By ridge and valley, driving\r\nhorses and sheep before us, we went to Tīmūr Beg's Langar and there\r\ndismounted. Fourteen or fifteen Hazāra thieves had fallen into our\r\nhands; I had thought of having them put to death when we next\r\ndismounted, with various torture, as a warning to all highwaymen and\r\nrobbers, but Qāsim Beg came across them on the road and, with mistimed\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 197.] compassion, set them free.\r\n\r\n   To do good to the bad is one and the same\r\n     As the doing of ill to the good;\r\n   On brackish soil no spikenard grows,\r\n     Waste no seed of toil upon it.[1226]\r\n\r\nOut of compassion the rest of the prisoners were released also.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Disloyalty in Kābul._)\r\n\r\nNews came while we were raiding the Turkmān Hazāras, that Muḥammad\r\nḤusain Mīrzā _Dūghlāt_ and Sl. Sanjar _Barlās_ had drawn over to\r\nthemselves the Mughūls left in Kābul, declared Mīrzā Khān (Wais) supreme\r\n(_pādshāh_), laid siege to the fort and spread a _report_ that\r\nBadī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā and Muz̤affar Mīrzā had sent me, a prisoner, to\r\nFort Ikhtiyāru'd-dīn, now known as Ālā-qūrghān.\r\n\r\nIn command of the Kābul-fort there had been left Mullā Bābā of\r\nPashāghar, Khalīfa, Muḥibb-i-`alī the armourer, Aḥmad-i-yūsuf and\r\nAḥmad-i-qāsim. They did well, made the fort fast, strengthened it, and\r\nkept watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Bābur's advance to Kābul._)\r\n\r\nFrom Tīmūr Beg's Langar we sent Qāsim Beg's servant, Muḥ. of Andijān, a\r\n_Tūqbāī_, to the Kābul begs, with written details of our arrival and of\r\nthe following arrangements:—\"When we are out of the Ghūr-bund\r\nnarrows,[1227] we will fall on them suddenly; let our signal to you be\r\nthe fire we will light directly we have passed Minār-hill; do you in\r\nreply light one in the citadel, on [Sidenote: Fol. 197b.] the old Kūshk\r\n(kiosk),\" now the Treasury, \"so that we may be sure you know of our\r\ncoming. We will come up from our side; you come out from yours; neglect\r\nnothing your hands can find to do!\" This having been put into writing,\r\nMuḥammad _Andijānī_ was sent off.\r\n\r\nRiding next dawn from the Langar, we dismounted over against\r\nUshtur-shahr. Early next morning we passed the Ghūr-bund narrows,\r\ndismounted at Bridge-head, there watered and rested our horses, and at\r\nthe Mid-day Prayer set forward again. Till we reached the\r\n_tūtqāwal_,[1228] there was no snow, beyond that, the further we went\r\nthe deeper the snow. The cold between Ẕamma-yakhshī and Minār was such\r\nas we had rarely felt in our lives.\r\n\r\nWe sent on Aḥmad the messenger (_yāsāwal_) and Qarā Aḥmad\r\n_yūrūnchī_[1229] to say to the begs, \"Here we are at the time promised;\r\nbe ready! be bold! \"After crossing Minār-hill[1230] and dismounting on\r\nits skirt, helpless with cold, we lit fires to warm ourselves. It was\r\nnot time to light the signal-fire; we just lit these because we were\r\nhelpless in that mighty cold. Near shoot of dawn we rode on from\r\nMinār-hill; between it and Kābul the snow was up to the horses' knees\r\nand had hardened, so off the road to move was difficult. Riding\r\nsingle-file the whole way, we got to Kābul [Sidenote: Fol. 198.] in good\r\ntime undiscovered.[1231] Before we were at Bībī Māh-rūī (Lady\r\nMoon-face), the blaze of fire on the citadel let us know that the begs\r\nwere looking out.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Attack made on the rebels._)\r\n\r\nOn reaching Sayyid Qāsim's bridge, Sherīm T̤aghāī and the men of the\r\nright were sent towards Mullā Bābā's bridge, while we of the left and\r\ncentre took the Bābā Lūlī road. Where Khalīfa's garden now is, there was\r\nthen a smallish garden made by Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā for a Langar\r\n(almshouse); none of its trees or shrubs were left but its enclosing\r\nwall was there. In this garden Mīrzā Khān was seated, Muḥ. Ḥusain Mīrzā\r\nbeing in Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā's great Bāgh-i-bihisht. I had gone as far\r\nalong the lane of Mullā Bābā's garden as the burial-ground when four men\r\nmet us who had hurried forward into Mīrzā Khān's quarters, been beaten,\r\nand forced to turn back. One of the four was Sayyid Qāsim Lord of the\r\nGate, another was Qāsim Beg's son Qaṃbar-i-`alī, another was Sher-qulī\r\nthe scout, another was Sl. Aḥmad _Mughūl_ one of Sher-qulī's band. These\r\nfour, without a \"God forbid!\" (_taḥāshī_) had gone right into Mīrzā\r\nKhān's quarters; thereupon he, hearing an uproar, had mounted and got\r\naway. Abū'l-ḥasan the armourer's younger brother even, Muḥ. Ḥusain by\r\nname, had taken service with Mīrzā Khān; he had slashed at Sher-qulī,\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 198b.] one of those four, thrown him down, and was just\r\nstriking his head off, when Sher-qulī freed himself. Those four, tasters\r\nof the sword, tasters of the arrow, wounded one and all, came pelting\r\nback on us to the place mentioned.\r\n\r\nOur horsemen, jammed in the narrow lane, were standing still, unable to\r\nmove forward or back. Said I to the braves near, \"Get off and force a\r\nroad\". Off got Nāṣir's Dost, Khwāja Muḥammad `Alī the librarian, Bābā\r\nSher-zād (Tiger-whelp), Shāh Maḥmūd and others, pushed forward and at\r\nonce cleared the way. The enemy took to flight.\r\n\r\nWe had looked for the begs to come out from the Fort but they could not\r\ncome in time for the work; they only dropped in, by ones and twos, after\r\nwe had made the enemy scurry off. Aḥmad-i-yūsuf had come from them\r\nbefore I went into the Chār-bāgh where Mīrzā Khān had been; he went in\r\nwith me, but we both turned back when we saw the Mīrzā had gone off.\r\nComing in at the garden-gate was Dost of Sar-i-pul, a foot-soldier I had\r\npromoted for his boldness to be Kotwāl and had left in Kābul; he made\r\nstraight for me, sword in hand. I had my cuirass on but had not fastened\r\nthe _gharīcha_[1232] nor had I put on [Sidenote: Fol. 199.] my helm.\r\nWhether he did not recognize me because of change wrought by cold and\r\nsnow, or whether because of the flurry of the fight, though I shouted\r\n\"Hāī Dost! hāī Dost!\" and though Aḥmad-i-yūsuf also shouted, he, without\r\na \"God forbid!\" brought down his sword on my unprotected arm. Only by\r\nGod's grace can it have been that not a hairbreadth of harm was done to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n   If a sword shook the Earth from her place,\r\n   Not a vein would it cut till God wills.\r\n\r\nIt was through the virtue of a prayer I had repeated that the Great God\r\naverted this danger and turned this evil aside. That prayer was as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n   \"O my God! Thou art my Creator; except Thee there is no God.\r\n   On Thee do I repose my trust; Thou art the Lord of the mighty\r\n   throne. What God wills comes to pass; and what he does not\r\n   will comes not to pass; and there is no power or strength but\r\n   through the high and exalted God; and, of a truth, in all\r\n   things God is almighty; and verily He comprehends all things\r\n   by his knowledge, and has taken account of everything. O my\r\n   Creator! as I sincerely trust in Thee, do Thou seize by the\r\n   forelock all evil proceeding from within myself, and all evil\r\n   coming from without, and all evil proceeding from every man\r\n   who can be the occasion of evil, and all such evil as can\r\n   proceed from any living thing, and remove them far from me;\r\n   since, of a truth, Thou art the Lord of the exalted\r\n   throne!\"[1233]\r\n\r\nOn leaving that garden we went to Muḥ. Ḥusain Mīrzā's quarters in the\r\nBāgh-i-bihisht, but he had fled and gone off to hide himself. Seven or\r\neight men stood in a breach of the [Sidenote: Fol. 199b.] garden-wall; I\r\nspurred at them; they could not stand; they fled; I got up with them and\r\ncut at one with my sword; he rolled over in such a way that I fancied\r\nhis head was off, passed on and went away; it seems he was Mīrzā Khān's\r\nfoster-brother, Tūlik Kūkūldāsh and that my sword fell on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nAt the gate of Muḥ. Ḥusain Mīrzā's quarters, a Mughūl I recognized for\r\none of my own servants, drew his bow and aimed at my face from a place\r\non the roof as near me as a gate-ward stands to a Gate. People on all\r\nsides shouted, \"Hāi! hāi! it is the Pādshāh.\" He changed his aim, shot\r\noff his arrow and ran away. The affair was beyond the shooting of\r\narrows! His Mīrzā, his leaders, had run away or been taken; why was he\r\nshooting?\r\n\r\nThere they brought Sl. Sanjar _Barlās_, led in by a rope round his neck;\r\nhe even, to whom I had given the Nīngnahār _tūmān_, had had his part in\r\nthe mutiny! Greatly agitated, he kept crying out, \"Hāi! what fault is in\r\nme?\" Said I, \"Can there be one clearer than that you are higher than the\r\npurpose and counsels of this crew?\"[1234] But as he was the sister's son\r\nof my Khān _dādā's_ mother, Shāh Begīm, I gave the order, \"Do not lead\r\nhim with such dishonour; it is not death.\"\r\n\r\nOn leaving that place, I sent Aḥmad-i-qasim _Kohbur_, one of the begs of\r\nthe Fort, with a few braves, in pursuit of [Sidenote: Fol. 200.] Mīrzā\r\nKhān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Bābur's dealings with disloyal women._)\r\n\r\nWhen I left the Bāgh-i-bihisht, I went to visit Shāh Begīm and\r\n(Mihr-nigār) Khānīm who had settled themselves in tents by the side of\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nAs townspeople and black-bludgeoners had raised a riot, and were putting\r\nhands out to pillage property and to catch persons in corners and\r\noutside places, I sent men, to beat the rabble off, and had it herded\r\nright away.[1235]\r\n\r\nShāh Begīm and Khānīm were seated in one tent. I dismounted at the usual\r\ndistance, approached with my former deference and courtesy, and had an\r\ninterview with them. They were extremely agitated, upset, and ashamed;\r\ncould neither excuse themselves reasonably[1236] nor make the enquiries\r\nof affection. I had not expected this (disloyalty) of them; it was not\r\nas though that party, evil as was the position it had taken up,\r\nconsisted of persons who would not give ear to the words of Shāh Begīm\r\nand Khānīm; Mīrzā Khān was the begīm's grandson, in her presence night\r\nand day; if she had not fallen in with the affair, she could have kept\r\nhim with her.\r\n\r\nTwice over when fickle Fortune and discordant Fate had parted\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 200b.] me from throne and country, retainer and\r\nfollowing, I, and my mother with me, had taken refuge with them and had\r\nhad no kindness soever from them. At that time my younger brother\r\n(_i.e._ cousin) Mīrzā Khān and his mother Sulṯān-nigār Khānīm held\r\nvaluable cultivated districts; yet my mother and I,—to leave all\r\nquestion of a district aside,—were not made possessors of a single\r\nvillage or a few yoke of plough-oxen.[1237] Was my mother not Yūnas\r\nKhān's daughter? was I not his grandson?\r\n\r\nIn my days of plenty I have given from my hand what matched the\r\nblood-relationship and the position of whatsoever member of that\r\n(Chaghatāī) dynasty chanced down upon me. For example, when the honoured\r\nShāh Begīm came to me, I gave her Pamghān, one of the best places in\r\nKābul, and failed in no sort of filial duty and service towards her.\r\nAgain, when Sl. Sa`īd Khān, Khān in Kāshghar, came [914 _AH._] with five\r\nor six naked followers on foot, I looked upon him as an honoured guest\r\nand gave him Mandrāwar of the Lamghān _tūmāns_. Beyond this also, when\r\nShāh Ismā`īl had killed Shaibāq Khān in Marv and I crossed over to\r\nQūndūz (916 _AH._-1511 _AD._), the Andijānīs, some driving their\r\n(Aūzbeg) _dāroghas_ out, some making their places fast, turned their\r\neyes to me and sent me a man; at that time I trusted those old family\r\nservants to that same Sl. Sa`īd Khān, gave him a force, made him Khān\r\nand sped him forth. Again, down to the present time (_circa_ 934 _AH._)\r\nI have not looked upon any member of that family who has come to me, in\r\nany other light than as a blood-relation. For example, there [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 201.] are now in my service Chīn-tīmūr Sulṯān; Aīsān-tīmūr Sulṯān,\r\nTūkhtā-būghā Sulṯān, and Bābā Sulṯān;[1238] on one and all of these I\r\nhave looked with more favour than on blood-relations of my own.\r\n\r\nI do not write this in order to make complaint; I have written the plain\r\ntruth. I do not set these matters down in order to make known my own\r\ndeserts; I have set down exactly what has happened. In this History I\r\nhave held firmly to it that the truth should be reached in every matter,\r\nand that every act should be recorded precisely as it occurred. From\r\nthis it follows of necessity that I have set down of good and bad\r\nwhatever is known, concerning father and elder brother, kinsman and\r\nstranger; of them all I have set down carefully the known virtues and\r\ndefects. Let the reader accept my excuse; let the reader pass on from\r\nthe place of severity!\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. Letters of victory._)\r\n\r\nRising from that place and going to the Chār-bāgh where Mīrzā Khān had\r\nbeen, we sent letters of victory to all the countries, clans, and\r\nretainers. This done, I rode to the citadel.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. Arrest of rebel leaders._)\r\n\r\nMuḥammad Ḥusain Mīrzā in his terror having run away into Khānīm's\r\nbedding-room and got himself fastened up in a bundle of bedding, we\r\nappointed Mīrīm _Dīwān_ with other begs of the fort, to take control in\r\nthose dwellings, capture, and bring him in. Mīrīm _Dīwān_ said some\r\nplain rough words at Khānīm's [Sidenote: Fol. 201b.] gate, by some means\r\nor other found the Mīrzā, and brought him before me in the citadel. I\r\nrose at once to receive the Mīrzā with my usual deference, not even\r\nshewing too harsh a face. If I had had that Muḥ. Ḥusain M. cut in\r\npieces, there was the ground for it that he had had part in base and\r\nshameful action, started and spurred on mutiny and treason. Death he\r\ndeserved with one after another of varied pain and torture, but because\r\nthere had come to be various connexion between us, his very sons and\r\ndaughters being by my own mother's sister Khūb-nigār Khānīm, I kept this\r\njust claim in mind, let him go free, and permitted him to set out\r\ntowards Khurāsān. The cowardly ingrate then forgot altogether the good I\r\ndid him by the gift of his life; he blamed and slandered me to Shaibāq\r\nKhān. Little time passed, however, before the Khān gave him his deserts\r\nby death.\r\n\r\n   Leave thou to Fate the man who does thee wrong,\r\n   For Fate is an avenging servitor.[1239]\r\n\r\nAḥmad-i-qāsim _Kohbur_ and the party of braves sent in pursuit of Mīrzā\r\nKhān, overtook him in the low hills of Qargha-yīlāq, not able even to\r\nrun away, without heart or force to stir a finger! [Sidenote: Fol. 202.]\r\nThey took him, and brought him to where I sat in the northeast porch of\r\nthe old Court-house. Said I to him, \"Come! let's have a look at one\r\nanother\" (_kūrūshālīng_), but twice before he could bend the knee and\r\ncome forward, he fell down through agitation. When we had looked at one\r\nanother, I placed him by my side to give him heart, and I drank first of\r\nthe sherbet brought in, in order to remove his fears.[1240]\r\n\r\nAs those who had joined him, soldiers, peasants, Mughūls and\r\nChaghatāīs,[1241] were in suspense, we simply ordered him to remain for\r\na few days in his elder sister's house; but a few days later he was\r\nallowed to set out for Khurāsān[1242] because those mentioned above were\r\nsomewhat uncertain and it did not seem well for him to stay in Kābul.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. Excursion to Koh-dāman._)\r\n\r\nAfter letting those two go, we made an excursion to Bārān, Chāsh-tūpa,\r\nand the skirt of Gul-i-bahār.[1243] More beautiful in Spring than any\r\npart even of Kābul are the open-lands of Bārān, the plain of Chāsh-tūpa,\r\nand the skirt of Gul-i-bahār. Many sorts of tulip bloom there; when I\r\nhad them counted once, it came out at 34 different kinds as [has been\r\nsaid].[1244] This couplet has been written in praise of these places,—\r\n\r\n   Kābul in Spring is an Eden of verdure and blossom;\r\n   Matchless in Kābul the Spring of Gul-i-bahār and Bārān.\r\n\r\nOn this excursion I finished the ode,—\r\n\r\n   _My heart, like the bud of the red, red rose,\r\n   Lies fold within fold aflame; [Sidenote: Fol. 202b.]\r\n   Would the breath of even a myriad Springs\r\n   Blow my heart's bud to a rose?_\r\n\r\nIn truth, few places are quite equal to these for spring-excursions, for\r\nhawking (_qūsh sālmāq_) or bird-shooting (_qūsh ātmāq_), as has been\r\nbriefly mentioned in the praise and description of the Kābul and Ghaznī\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_q. Nāṣir Mīrzā expelled from Badakhshān._)\r\n\r\nThis year the begs of Badakhshān _i.e._ Muḥammad the armourer, Mubārak\r\nShāh, Zubair and Jahāngīr, grew angry and mutinous because of the\r\nmisconduct of Nāṣir Mīrzā and some of those he cherished. Coming to an\r\nagreement together, they drew out an army of horse and foot, arrayed it\r\non the level lands by the Kūkcha-water, and moved towards Yaftal and\r\nRāgh, to near Khamchān, by way of the lower hills. The Mīrzā and his\r\ninexperienced begs, in their thoughtless and unobservant fashion, came\r\nout to fight them just in those lower hills. The battle-field was uneven\r\nground; the Badakhshīs had a dense mass of men on foot who stood firm\r\nunder repeated charges by the Mīrzā's horse, and returned such attack\r\nthat the horsemen fled, unable to keep their ground. Having beaten the\r\nMīrzā, the Badakhshīs plundered his dependants and connexions.\r\n\r\nBeaten and stripped bare, he and his close circle took the road through\r\nIshkīmīsh and Nārīn to Kīlā-gāhī, from there followed the Qīzīl-sū up,\r\ngot out on the Āb-dara road, crossed at Shibr-tū, and so came to Kābul,\r\nhe with 70 or 80 followers, worn-out, naked and famished.\r\n\r\nThat was a marvellous sign of the Divine might! Two or three years\r\nearlier the Mīrzā had left the Kābul country like a [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n203.] foe, driving tribes and hordes like sheep before him, reached\r\nBadakhshān and made fast its forts and valley-strongholds. With what\r\nfancy in his mind had he marched out?[1245] Now he was back, hanging the\r\nhead of shame for those earlier misdeeds, humbled and distraught about\r\nthat breach with me!\r\n\r\nMy face shewed him no sort of displeasure; I made kind enquiry about\r\nhimself, and brought him out of his confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n913 AH.-MAY 13TH 1507 TO MAY 2ND 1508 AD.[1246]\r\n\r\n(_a. Raid on the Ghiljī Afghāns._)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had ridden out of Kābul with the intention of over-running the\r\nGhiljī;[1247] when we dismounted at Sar-i-dih news was brought that a\r\nmass of Mahmands (Afghāns) was lying in Masht and Sih-kāna one _yīghāch_\r\n(_circa_ 5 m.) away from us.[1248] Our begs and braves agreed in saying,\r\n\"The Mahmands must be over-run\", but I said, \"Would it be right to turn\r\naside and raid our own peasants instead of doing what we set out to do?\r\nIt cannot be.\"\r\n\r\nRiding at night from Sar-i-dih, we crossed the plain of Kattawāz in the\r\ndark, a quite black night, one level stretch of land, no mountain or\r\nrising-ground in sight, no known road or track, not a man able to lead\r\nus! In the end I took the lead. I had been in those parts several times\r\nbefore; drawing inferences from those times, I took the Pole-star on my\r\nright shoulder-blade[1249] and, with some anxiety, moved on. God brought\r\nit right! We went straight to the Qīāq-tū and the Aūlābā-tū torrent,\r\nthat is to say, straight for Khwāja Ismā`īl _Sirītī_ where the Ghiljīs\r\nwere lying, the road to which crosses the torrent named. Dismounting\r\nnear the torrent, we let ourselves and our horses sleep a little,\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 203b.] took breath, and bestirred ourselves at shoot of\r\ndawn. The Sun was up before we got out of those low hills and\r\nvalley-bottoms to the plain on which the Ghiljī lay with a good\r\n_yīghāch_[1250] of road between them and us; once out on the plain we\r\ncould see their blackness, either their own or from the smoke of their\r\nfires.\r\n\r\nWhether bitten by their own whim,[1251] or whether wanting to hurry, the\r\nwhole army streamed off at the gallop (_chāpqūn qūīdīlār_); off galloped\r\nI after them and, by shooting an arrow now at a man, now at a horse,\r\nchecked them after a _kuroh_ or two (3 m.?). It is very difficult indeed\r\nto check 5 or 6000 braves galloping loose-rein! God brought it right!\r\nThey were checked! When we had gone about one _shar`ī_ (2 m.) further,\r\nalways with the Afghān blackness in sight, the raid[1252] was allowed.\r\nMasses of sheep fell to us, more than in any other raid.\r\n\r\nAfter we had dismounted and made the spoils turn back,[1253] one body of\r\nAfghāns after another came down into the plain, provoking a fight. Some\r\nof the begs and of the household went against one body and killed every\r\nman; Nāṣir Mīrzā did the same with another, and a pillar of Afghān heads\r\nwas set up. An arrow pierced the foot of that foot-soldier Dost the\r\nKotwāl who has been mentioned already;[1254] when we reached Kābul, he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nMarching from Khwāja Ismā`īl, we dismounted once more at Aūlābā-tū. Some\r\nof the begs and of my own household were ordered to go forward and\r\ncarefully separate off the Fifth (_Khums_) of the enemy's spoils. By way\r\nof favour, we did not [Sidenote: Fol. 204.] take the Fifth from Qāsim\r\nBeg and some others.[1255] From what was written down,[1256] the Fifth\r\ncame out at 16,000, that is to say, this 16,000 was the fifth of 80,000\r\nsheep; no question however but that with those lost and those not asked\r\nfor, a _lak_ (100,000) of sheep had been taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. A hunting-circle._)\r\n\r\nNext day when we had ridden from that camp, a hunting-circle was formed\r\non the plain of Kattawāz where deer (_kiyīk_)[1257] and wild-ass are\r\nalways plentiful and always fat. Masses went into the ring; masses were\r\nkilled. During the hunt I galloped after a wild-ass, on getting near\r\nshot one arrow, shot another, but did not bring it down, it only running\r\nmore slowly for the two wounds. Spurring forwards and getting into\r\nposition[1258] quite close to it, I chopped at the nape of its neck\r\nbehind the ears, and cut through the wind-pipe; it stopped, turned over\r\nand died. My sword cut well! The wild-ass was surprisingly fat. Its rib\r\nmay have been a little under one yard in length. Sherīm T̤aghāī and\r\nother observers of _kiyīk_ in Mughūlistān said with surprise, \"Even in\r\nMughūlistān we have seen few _kiyīk_ so fat!\" I shot another wild-ass;\r\nmost of the wild-asses and deer brought down in that hunt were fat, but\r\nnot one of them was so fat as the one I first killed.\r\n\r\nTurning back from that raid, we went to Kābul and there dismounted.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Shaibāq Khān moves against Khurāsān._)\r\n\r\nShaibāq Khān had got an army to horse at the end of last year, meaning\r\nto go from Samarkand against Khurāsān, his [Sidenote: Fol. 204b.] march\r\nout being somewhat hastened by the coming to him of a servant of that\r\nvile traitor to his salt, Shāh Manṣūr the Paymaster, then in Andikhūd.\r\nWhen the Khān was approaching Andikhūd, that vile wretch said, \"I have\r\nsent a man to the Aūzbeg,\" relied on this, adorned himself, stuck up an\r\naigrette on his head, and went out, bearing gift and tribute. On this\r\nthe leaderless[1259] Aūzbegs poured down on him from all sides, and\r\nturned upside down (_tart-part_) the blockhead, his offering and his\r\npeople of all sorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Irresolution of the Khurāsān Mīrzās._)\r\n\r\nBadī`u´z-zamān Mīrzā, Muz̤affar Mīrzā, Muḥ. Barandūq _Barlās_ and\r\nẔū´n-nūn _Arghūn_ were all lying with their army in Bābā Khākī,[1260]\r\nnot decided to fight, not settled to make (Herī) fort fast, there they\r\nsat, confounded, vague, uncertain what to do. Muḥammad Barandūq _Barlās_\r\nwas a knowledgeable man; he kept saying, \"You let Muz̤affar Mīrzā and me\r\nmake the fort fast; let Badī`u´z-zamān Mīrzā and Ẕū´n-nūn Beg go into\r\nthe mountains near Herī and gather in Sl. `Alī _Arghūn_ from Sīstān and\r\nZamīn-dāwar, Shāh Beg and Muqīm from Qandahār with all their armies, and\r\nlet them collect also what there is of Nikdīrī and Hazāra force; this\r\ndone, let them make a swift and telling move. The enemy would find it\r\ndifficult to go into the mountains, and could not come against the\r\n(Herī) fort because [Sidenote: Fol. 205.] he would be afraid of the army\r\noutside.\" He said well, his plan was practical.\r\n\r\nBrave though Ẕū´n-nūn _Arghūn_ was, he was mean, a lover-of-goods, far\r\nfrom businesslike or judicious, rather shallow-pated, and a bit of a\r\nfool. As has been mentioned,[1261] when that elder and that younger\r\nbrother became joint-rulers in Herī, he had chief authority in\r\nBadī`u´z-zamān Mīrzā's presence. He was not willing now for Muḥ.\r\nBarandūq Beg to remain inside Herī town; being the lover-of-goods he\r\nwas, he wanted to be there himself. But he could not make this seem one\r\nand the same thing![1262] Is there a better sign of his shallow-pate and\r\ncraze than that he degraded himself and became contemptible by accepting\r\nthe lies and flattery of rogues and sycophants? Here are the\r\nparticulars[1263]:—While he was so dominant and trusted in Herī, certain\r\nShaikhs and Mullās went to him and said, \"The Spheres are holding\r\ncommerce with us; you are styled _Hizabru´l-lāh_ (Lion of God); you will\r\novercome the Aūzbeg.\" Believing these words, he put his bathing-cloth\r\nround his neck and gave thanks. It was through this he did not accept\r\nMuḥammad Barandūq Beg's sensible counsel, did not strengthen the works\r\n(_aīsh_) of the fort, get ready fighting equipment, set scout or\r\nrearward to warn of the foe's approach, or plan out such method of array\r\nthat, should the foe appear, his men would fight with ready heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Shaibāq Khān takes Herī._)\r\n\r\nShaibāq Khān passed through Murgh-āb to near Sīr-kāī[1264] in [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 205b.] the month of Muḥarram (913 AH. May-June 1507 AD.). When the\r\nMīrzās heard of it, they were altogether upset, could not act, collect\r\ntroops, array those they had. Dreamers, they moved through a\r\ndream![1265] Ẕū'n-nūn _Arghūn_, made glorious by that flattery, went out\r\nto Qarā-rabāṯ, with 100 to 150 men, to face 40,000 to 50,000 Aūzbegs: a\r\nmass of these coming up, hustled his off, took him, killed him and cut\r\noff his head.[1266]\r\n\r\nIn Fort Ikhtiyāru'd-dīn, it is known as Ālā-qūrghān,[1267] were the\r\nMīrzās' mothers, elder and younger sisters, wives and treasure. The\r\nMīrzās reached the town at night, let their horses rest till midnight,\r\nslept, and at dawn flung forth again. They could not think about\r\nstrengthening the fort; in the respite and crack of time there was, they\r\njust ran away,[1268] leaving mother, sister, wife and little child to\r\nAūzbeg captivity.\r\n\r\nWhat there was of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's _ḥaram_, Pāyanda-sulṯān Begīm and\r\nKhadīja Begīm at the head of it, was inside Ālā-qūrghān; there too were\r\nthe _ḥarams_ of Badī`u'z-zamān Mīrzā[1269] and Muz̤affar Mīrzā with\r\ntheir little children, treasure, and households (_biyutāt_). What was\r\ndesirable for making the fort fast had not been done; even braves to\r\nreinforce it had not arrived. `Āshiq-i-muḥammad _Arghūn_, the younger\r\nbrother of Mazīd Beg, had fled from the army on foot and gone into it;\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 206.] in it was also Amīr `Umar Beg's son `Alī Khān\r\n(_Turkmān_); Shaikh `Abdu'l-lāh the taster was there; Mīrzā Beg\r\n_Kāī-khusraūī_ was there; and Mīrak _Gūr_ (or _Kūr_) the Dīwān was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWhen Shaibāq Khān arrived two or three days later; the Shaikhu'l-islām\r\nand notables went out to him with the keys of the outer-fort. That same\r\n`Āshiq-i-muḥammad held Ālā-qūrghān for 16 or 17 days; then a mine, run\r\nfrom the horse-market outside, was fired and brought a tower down; the\r\ngarrison lost heart, could hold out no longer, so let the fort be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Shaibāq Khān in Herī._)\r\n\r\nShaibāq Khān, after taking Herī,[1270] behaved badly not only to the\r\nwives and children of its rulers but to every person soever. For the\r\nsake of this five-days' fleeting world, he earned himself a bad name.\r\nHis first improper act and deed in Herī was that, for the sake of this\r\nrotten world (_chirk dunyā_), he caused Khadīja Begīm various miseries,\r\nthrough letting the vile wretch Pay-master Shāh Manṣūr get hold of her\r\nto loot. Then he let `Abdu'l-wahhāb _Mughūl_ take to loot a person so\r\nsaintly and so revered as Shaikh Pūrān, and each one of Shaikh Pūrān's\r\nchildren be taken by a separate person. He let the band of poets be\r\nseized by Mullā Banā'ī, a matter about which this verse is well-known in\r\nKhurāsān:—\r\n\r\n   Except `Abdu'l-lāh the stupid fool (_kīr-khar_),\r\n     Not a poet to-day sees the colour of gold;\r\n   From the poets' band Banā'ī would get gold,\r\n     All he will get is _kīr-khar_.[1271] [Sidenote: Fol. 206b.]\r\n\r\nDirectly he had possession of Herī, Shaibāq Khān married and took\r\nMuz̤affar Mīrzā's wife, Khān-zāda Khānīm, without regard to the\r\nrunning-out of the legal term.[1272] His own illiteracy not forbidding,\r\nhe instructed in the exposition of the Qoran, Qāẓī Ikhtiyār and Muḥammad\r\nMīr Yūsuf, two of the celebrated and highly-skilled mullās of Herī; he\r\ntook a pen and corrected the hand-writing of Mullā Sl. `Alī of Mashhad\r\nand the drawing of Bih-zād; and every few days, when he had composed\r\nsome tasteless couplet, he would have it read from the pulpit, hung in\r\nthe Chār-sū [Square], and for it accept the offerings of the\r\ntowns-people![1273] Spite of his early-rising, his not neglecting the\r\nFive Prayers, and his fair knowledge of the art of reciting the Qorān,\r\nthere issued from him many an act and deed as absurd, as impudent, and\r\nas heathenish as those just named.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Death of two Mīrzās._)\r\n\r\nTen or fifteen days after he had possession of Herī, Shaibāq Khān came\r\nfrom Kahd-stān[1274] to Pul-i-sālār. From that place he sent Tīmūr Sl.\r\nand `Ubaid Sl. with the army there present, against Abū'l-muḥsin Mīrzā\r\nand Kūpuk (Kīpik) Mīrzā then seated carelessly in Mashhad. The two\r\nMīrzās had thought at one time of making Qalāt[1275] fast; at another,\r\nthis after they had had news of the approach of the Aūzbeg, they were\r\nfor moving on Shaibāq Khān himself, by forced marches and along a\r\ndifferent road,[1276]—which might have turned out an amazingly good\r\nidea! But while they sit still there in Mashhad with nothing decided,\r\nthe Sulṯāns arrive by forced marches. The Mīrzās for their part\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 207.] array and go out; Abū'l-muḥsin Mīrzā is quickly\r\novercome and routed; Kūpuk Mīrzā charges his brother's assailants with\r\nsomewhat few men; him too they carry off; both brothers are dismounted\r\nand seated in one place; after an embrace (_qūchūsh_), they kiss\r\nfarewell; Abū'l-muḥsin shews some want of courage; in Kūpuk Mirza it all\r\nmakes no change at all. The heads of both are sent to Shaibāq Khān in\r\nPul-i-sālār.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Bābur marches for Qandahār._)\r\n\r\nIn those days Shāh Beg and his younger brother Muḥammad Muqīm, being\r\nafraid of Shaibāq Khān, sent one envoy after another to me with dutiful\r\nletters (_`arz-dāsht_), giving sign of amity and good-wishes. Muqīm, in\r\na letter of his own, explicitly invited me. For us to look on at the\r\nAūzbeg over-running the whole country, was not seemly; and as by letters\r\nand envoys, Shāh Beg and Muqīm had given me invitation, there remained\r\nlittle doubt they would wait upon me.[1277] When all begs and\r\ncounsellors had been consulted, the matter was left at this:—We were to\r\nget an army to horse, join the Arghūn begs and decide in accord and\r\nagreement with them, whether to move into Khurāsān or elsewhere as might\r\nseem good.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. In Ghasnī and Qalāt-i-ghilzāī._)\r\n\r\nḤabība-sulṯān Begīm, my aunt (_yīnkā_) as I used to call her, met us in\r\nGhaznī, having come from Herī, according to arrangement, in order to\r\nbring her daughter Maṣ`ūma-sulṯān Begīm. [Sidenote: Fol. 207b.] With the\r\nhonoured Begīm came Khusrau Kūkūldāsh, Sl. Qulī _Chūnāq_ (One-eared) and\r\nGadāī _Balāl_ who had returned to me after flight from Herī, first to\r\nIbn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā then to Abū'l-muḥsin Mīrzā,[1278] with neither of\r\nwhom they could remain.\r\n\r\nIn Qalāt the army came upon a mass of Hindūstān traders, come there to\r\ntraffic and, as it seemed, unable to go on. The general opinion about\r\nthem was that people who, at a time of such hostilities, are coming into\r\nan enemy's country[1279] must be plundered. With this however I did not\r\nagree; said I, \"What is the traders' offence? If we, looking to God's\r\npleasure, leave such scrapings of gain aside, the Most High God will\r\napportion our reward. It is now just as it was a short time back when we\r\nrode out to raid the Ghiljī; many of you then were of one mind to raid\r\nthe Mahmand Afghāns, their sheep and goods, their wives and families,\r\njust because they were within five miles of you! Then as now I did not\r\nagree with you. On the very next day the Most High God apportioned you\r\nmore sheep belonging to Afghān enemies, than had ever before fallen to\r\nthe share of the army.\" Something by way of _peshkash_ (offering) was\r\ntaken from each trader when we dismounted on the other side of Qalāt.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Further march south._)\r\n\r\nBeyond Qalāt two Mīrzās joined us, fleeing from Qandahār. One was Mīrzā\r\nKhān (Wais) who had been allowed to go into Khurāsān after his defeat at\r\nKābul. The other was `Abdu'r-razzāq [Sidenote: Fol. 208.] Mīrzā who had\r\nstayed on in Khurāsān when I left. With them came and waited on me the\r\nmother of Jahāngīr Mīrzā's son Pīr-i-muḥammad, a grandson of Pahār\r\nMīrzā.[1280]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Behaviour of the Arghūn chiefs._)\r\n\r\nWhen we sent persons and letters to Shāh Beg and Muqīm, saying, \"Here we\r\nare at your word; a stranger-foe like the Aūzbeg has taken Khurāsān;\r\ncome! let us settle, in concert and amity, what will be for the general\r\ngood,\" they returned a rude and ill-mannered answer, going back from the\r\ndutiful letters they had written and from the invitations they had\r\ngiven. One of their incivilities was that Shāh Beg stamped his letter to\r\nme in the middle of its reverse, where begs seal if writing to begs,\r\nwhere indeed a great beg seals if writing to one of the lower\r\ncircle.[1281] But for such ill-manners and his rude answers, his affair\r\nwould never have gone so far as it did, for, as they say,—\r\n\r\n   A strife-stirring word will accomplish the downfall of\r\n     an ancient line.\r\n\r\nBy these their headstrong acts they gave to the winds house, family, and\r\nthe hoards of 30 to 40 years.\r\n\r\nOne day while we were near Shahr-i-ṣafā[1282] a false alarm being given\r\nin the very heart of the camp, the whole army was made to arm and mount.\r\nAt the time I was occupied with a bath [Sidenote: Fol. 208b.] and\r\npurification; the begs were much flurried; I mounted when I was ready;\r\nas the alarm was false, it died away after a time.\r\n\r\nMarch by march we moved on to Guzar.[1283] There we tried again to\r\ndiscuss with the Arghūns but, paying no attention to us, they maintained\r\nthe same obstinate and perverse attitude. Certain well-wishers who knew\r\nthe local land and water, represented to me, that the head of the\r\ntorrents (_rūdlār_) which come down to Qandahār, being towards Bābā\r\nḤasan Abdāl and Khalishak,[1284] a move ought to be made in that\r\ndirection, in order to cut off (_yīqmāq_) all those torrents.[1285]\r\nLeaving the matter there, we next day made our men put on their mail,\r\narrayed in right and left, and marched for Qandahār.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Battle of Qandahār._)\r\n\r\nShāh Beg and Muqīm had seated themselves under an awning which was set\r\nin front of the naze of the Qandahār-hill where I am now having a\r\nrock-residence cut out.[1286] Muqīm's men pushed forward amongst the\r\ntrees to rather near us. T̤ūfān _Arghūn_ had fled to us when we were\r\nnear Shahr-i-ṣafā; he now betook himself alone close up to the Arghūn\r\narray to where one named `Ashaqu'l-lāh was advancing rather fast leading\r\n7 or 8 men. Alone, T̤ūfān _Arghūn_ faced him, slashed swords with him,\r\nunhorsed him, cut off his head and brought it to me as we were passing\r\nSang-i-lakhshak;[1287] an omen we accepted! Not thinking it well to\r\nfight where we were, amongst suburbs and trees, we went on along the\r\nskirt of the hill. Just as we had settled on ground for the camp, in a\r\nmeadow on the Qandahār side of the [Sidenote: Fol. 209.] torrent,[1288]\r\nopposite Khalishak, and were dismounting, Sher Qulī the scout hurried up\r\nand represented that the enemy was arrayed to fight and on the move\r\ntowards us.\r\n\r\nAs on our march from Qalāt the army had suffered much from hunger and\r\nthirst, most of the soldiers on getting near Khalishak scattered up and\r\ndown for sheep and cattle, grain and eatables. Without looking to\r\ncollect them, we galloped off. Our force may have been 2000 in all, but\r\nperhaps not over 1000 were in the battle because those mentioned as\r\nscattering up and down could not rejoin in time to fight.\r\n\r\nThough our men were few I had them organized and posted on a first-rate\r\nplan and method; I had never arrayed them before by such a good one. For\r\nmy immediate command (_khāṣa tābīn_) I had selected braves from whose\r\nhands comes work[1289] and had inscribed them by tens and fifties, each\r\nten and each fifty under a leader who knew the post in the right or left\r\nof the centre for his ten or his fifty, knew the work of each in the\r\nbattle, and was there on the observant watch; so that, after mounting,\r\nthe right and left, right and left hands, right and left sides, charged\r\nright and left without the trouble of arraying them or the need of a\r\n_tawāchī_.[1290]\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on his terminology._) [Sidenote: Fol. 209b.]\r\n   Although _barānghār_, _aūng qūl_, _aūng yān_ and _aūng_ (right\r\n   wing, right hand, right side and right) all have the same\r\n   meaning, I have applied them in different senses in order to\r\n   vary terms and mark distinctions. As, in the battle-array, the\r\n   (Ar.) _maimana_ and _maisara_ _i.e._ what people call (Turkī)\r\n   _barānghār_ and _jawānghār_ (r. and l. wings) are not included\r\n   in the (Ar.) _qalb_, _i.e._ what people call (T.) _ghūl_\r\n   (centre), so it is in arraying the centre itself. Taking the\r\n   array of the centre only, its (Ar.) _yamīn_ and _yasār_ (r.\r\n   and l.) are called (by me) _aūng qūl_ and _sūl qūl_ (r. and l.\r\n   hands). Again,—the (Ar.) _khāṣa tābīn_ (royal troop) in the\r\n   centre has its _yamīn_ and _yasār_ which are called (by me)\r\n   _aūng yān_ and _sūl yān_ (r. and l. sides, T. _yān_).\r\n   Again,—in the _khāṣa tābīn_ there is the (T.) _būī_ (_nīng_)\r\n   _tīkīnī_ (close circle); its _yamīn_ and _yasār_ are called\r\n   _sūng_ and _sūl_. In the Turkī tongue they call one single\r\n   thing a _būī_,[1291] but that is not the _būī_ meant here;\r\n   what is meant here is close (_yāqīn_).\r\n\r\nThe right wing (_barānghār_) was Mīrzā Khān (Wais), Sherīm T̤aghāī,\r\nYārak T̤aghāī with his elder and younger brethren, Chilma _Mughūl_, Ayūb\r\nBeg, Muḥammad Beg, Ibrāhīm Beg, `Alī Sayyid _Mughūl_ with his Mughūls,\r\nSl. Qulī _chuhra_, Khudā-bakhsh and Abū'l-ḥasan with his elder and\r\nyounger brethren.\r\n\r\nThe left (_jawānghār_) was `Abdu'r-razzāq Mīrzā, Qāsim Beg,\r\nTīngrī-bīrdī, Qaṃbar-i-`alī, Aḥmad _Aīlchī-būghā_, Ghūrī _Barlās_,\r\nSayyid Ḥusain Akbar, and Mīr Shāh _Qūchin_.\r\n\r\nThe advance (_aīrāwal_) was Nāṣir Mīrzā, Sayyid Qāsim Lord of the Gate,\r\nMuḥibb-i-`alī the armourer, Pāpā Aūghulī (Pāpā's son?), Allāh-wairan\r\n_Turkmān_, Sher Qulī _Mughūl_ the scout with his elder and younger\r\nbrethren, and Muḥammad `Alī.\r\n\r\nIn the centre (_ghūl_), on my right hand, were Qāsim Kūkūldāsh, Khusrau\r\nKūkūldāsh, Sl. Muḥammad _Dūldāī_, Shāh Maḥmūd the secretary,\r\nQūl-i-bāyazīd the taster, and Kamāl the sherbet-server [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n210.] server; on my left were Khwāja Muḥammad `Alī, Nāṣir's Dost,\r\nNāṣir's Mīrīm, Bābā Sher-zād, Khān-qulī, Walī the treasurer,\r\nQūtlūq-qadam the scout, Maqsūd the water-bearer (_sū-chī_), and Bābā\r\nShaikh. Those in the centre were all of my household; there were no\r\ngreat begs; not one of those enumerated had reached the rank of beg.\r\nThose inscribed in this _būī_[1292] were Sher Beg, Ḥātim the\r\nArmoury-master, Kūpuk, Qulī Bābā, Abū'l-ḥasan the armourer;—of the\r\nMughūls, Aūrūs (Russian) `Alī Sayyid,[1293] Darwīsh-i-`alī Sayyid,\r\nKhūsh-kīldī, Chilma, Dost-kīldī, Chilma _Tāghchī_, Dāmāchī, Mindī;—of\r\nthe Turkmāns, Manṣūr, Rustam-i-`alī with his elder and younger brother,\r\nand Shāh Nāẕir and Sīūndūk.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was in two divisions, one under Shāh Shujā' _Arghūn_, known as\r\nShāh Beg and hereafter to be written of simply as Shāh Beg, the other\r\nunder his younger brother Muqīm.\r\n\r\nSome estimated the dark mass of Arghūns[1294] at 6 or 7000 men; no\r\nquestion whatever but that Shāh Beg's own men in mail were 4 or 5000. He\r\nfaced our right, Muqīm with a force smaller may-be than his brother's,\r\nfaced our left. Muqīm made a mightily strong attack on our left, that is\r\non Qāsim Beg from whom two or three persons came before fighting began,\r\nto ask for reinforcement; we however could not detach a man because in\r\nfront of us also the enemy was very strong. We made our onset without\r\nany delay; the enemy fell suddenly on our van, [Sidenote: Fol. 210b.]\r\nturned it back and rammed it on our centre. When we, after a discharge\r\nof arrows, advanced, they, who also had been shooting for a time,\r\nseemed likely to make a stand (_tūkhtaghāndīk_). Some-one, shouting to\r\nhis men, came forward towards me, dismounted and was for adjusting his\r\narrow, but he could do nothing because we moved on without stay. He\r\nremounted and rode off; it may have been Shāh Beg himself. During the\r\nfight Pīrī Beg _Turkmān_ and 4 or 5 of his brethren turned their faces\r\nfrom the foe and, turban in hand,[1295] came over to us.\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on Pīrī Beg._) This Pīrī Beg was one of those\r\n   Turkmāns who came [into Herī] with the Turkmān Begs led by\r\n   `Abdu'l-bāqī Mīrzā and Murād Beg, after Shāh Ismā`īl\r\n   vanquished the Bāyandar sulṯāns and seized the `Irāq\r\n   countries.[1296]\r\n\r\nOur right was the first to overcome the foe; it made him hurry off. Its\r\nextreme point had gone pricking (_sānjīlīb_)[1297] as far as where I\r\nhave now laid out a garden. Our left extended as far as the great\r\ntree-tangled[1298] irrigation-channels, a good way below Bābā Ḥasan\r\nAbdāl. Muqīm was opposite it, its numbers very small compared with his.\r\nGod brought it right! Between it and Muqīm were three or four of the\r\ntree-tangled water-channels going on to Qandahār;[1299] it held the\r\ncrossing-place and allowed no passage; small body though it was, it made\r\nsplendid stand [Sidenote: Fol. 211.] and kept its ground. Ḥalwāchī\r\nTarkhān[1300] slashed away in the water with Tīngrī-bīrdī and\r\nQaṃbar-i-`alī. Qaṃbar-i-`alī was wounded; an arrow stuck in Qāsim Beg's\r\nforehead; another struck Ghūrī _Barlās_ above the eyebrow and came out\r\nabove his cheek.[1301]\r\n\r\nWe meantime, after putting our adversary to flight, had crossed those\r\nsame channels towards the naze of Murghān-koh (Birds'-hill). Some-one on\r\na grey _tīpūchāq_ was going backwards and forwards irresolutely along\r\nthe hill-skirt, while we were getting across; I likened him to Shāh\r\nBeg; seemingly it was he.\r\n\r\nOur men having beaten their opponents, all went off to pursue and\r\nunhorse them. Remained with me eleven to count, `Abdu'l-lāh the\r\nlibrarian being one. Muqīm was still keeping his ground and fighting.\r\nWithout a glance at the fewness of our men, we had the nagarets sounded\r\nand, putting our trust in God, moved with face set for Muqīm.\r\n\r\n   (Turkī) For few or for many God is full strength;\r\n              No man has might in His Court.\r\n\r\n   (Arabic) How often, God willing it, a small force has vanquished\r\n              a large one!\r\n\r\nLearning from the nagarets that we were approaching, Muqīm forgot his\r\nfixed plan and took the road of flight. God brought it right!\r\n\r\nAfter putting our foe to flight, we moved for Qandahār and dismounted in\r\nFarrukh-zād Beg's Chār-bāgh, of which at this time not a trace remains!\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Bābur enters Qandahār._) [Sidenote: Fol. 211b.]\r\n\r\nShāh Beg and Muqīm could not get into Qandahār when they took to flight;\r\nShāh Beg went towards Shāl and Mastūng (Quetta), Muqīm towards\r\nZamīn-dāwar. They left no-one able to make the fort fast. Aḥmad `Alī\r\nTarkhān was in it together with other elder and younger brethren of Qulī\r\nBeg _Arghūn_ whose attachment and good-feeling for me were known. After\r\nparley they asked protection for the families of their elder and younger\r\nbrethren; their request was granted and all mentioned were encompassed\r\nwith favour. They then opened the Māshūr-gate of the town; with\r\nleaderless men in mind, no other was opened. At that gate were posted\r\nSherīm T̤aghāī and Yārīm Beg. I went in with a few of the household,\r\ncharged the leaderless men and had two or three put to death by way of\r\nexample.[1302]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. The spoils of Qandahār._)\r\n\r\nI got to Muqīm's treasury first, that being in the outer-fort;\r\n`Abdu'r-razzāq Mīrzā must have been quicker than I, for he was just\r\ndismounting there when I arrived; I gave him a few things from it. I put\r\nDost-i-nāṣir Beg, Qul-i-bāyazīd the taster and, of pay-masters, Muḥammad\r\n_bakhshī_ in charge of it, then passed on into the citadel and posted\r\nKhwāja Muḥammad `Alī, Shāh Maḥmūd and, of the pay-masters, T̤aghāī Shāh\r\n_bakhshī_ in charge of Shāh Beg's treasury.\r\n\r\nNāṣir's Mīrīm and Maqṣūd the sherbet-server were sent to keep the house\r\nof Ẕū'n-nūn's _Dīwān_ Mīr Jān for Nāṣir Mīrzā; for Mīrzā Khān was kept\r\nShaikh Abū-sa`īd _Tarkhānī's_; for `Abdu'r-razzāq Mīrzā ... 's.[1303]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 212.] Such masses of white money had never been seen in\r\nthose countries; no-one indeed was to be heard of who had seen so much.\r\nThat night, when we ourselves stayed in the citadel, Shāh Beg's slave\r\nSaṃbhal was captured and brought in. Though he was then Shāh Beg's\r\nintimate, he had not yet received his later favour.[1304] I had him\r\ngiven into someone's charge but as good watch was not kept, he was\r\nallowed to escape. Next day I went back to my camp in Farrukh-zād Beg's\r\nChār-bāgh.\r\n\r\nI gave the Qandahār country to Nāṣir Mīrzā. After the treasure had been\r\ngot into order, loaded up and started off, he took the loads of white\r\n_tankas_ off a string of camels (_i.e._ _7_ beasts) at the\r\ncitadel-treasury, and kept them. I did not demand them back; I just gave\r\nthem to him.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Qandahār, we dismounted in the Qūsh-khāna meadow. After\r\nsetting the army forward, I had gone for an excursion, so I got into\r\ncamp rather late. It was another camp! not to be recognized! Excellent\r\n_tīpūchāqs_, strings and strings of he-camels, she-camels, and mules,\r\nbearing saddle-bags (_khurzīn_) of silken stuffs and cloth,—tents of\r\nscarlet (cloth) and velvet, all sorts of awnings, every kind of\r\nwork-shop, ass-load after ass-load of chests! The goods of the elder and\r\nyounger (Arghūn) brethren had been kept in separate treasuries; out of\r\neach had come chest upon chest, bale upon bale of stuffs and\r\nclothes-in-wear (_artmāq artmāq_), sack upon sack of white _tankas_. In\r\n_aūtāgh_ and _chādar_ (lattice-tent and pole-tent) was much spoil for\r\nevery man soever; many sheep also had been taken but sheep were less\r\ncared about!\r\n\r\nI made over to Qāsim Beg Muqīm's retainers in Qalāt, under [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 212b.] Qūj _Arghūn_ and Tāju'd-dīn Maḥmūd, with their goods and\r\neffects. Qāsim Beg was a knowing person; he saw it unadvisable for us to\r\nstay long near Qandahār, so, by talking and talking, worrying and\r\nworrying, he got us to march off. As has been said, I had bestowed\r\nQandahār on Nāṣir Mīrzā; he was given leave to go there; we started for\r\nKābul.\r\n\r\nThere had been no chance of portioning out the spoils while we were near\r\nQandahār; it was done at Qarā-bāgh where we delayed two or three days.\r\nTo count the coins being difficult, they were apportioned by weighing\r\nthem in scales. Begs of all ranks, retainers and household (_tābīn_)\r\nloaded up ass-load after ass-load of sacks full of white _tankas_, and\r\ntook them away for their own subsistence and the pay of their soldiers.\r\n\r\nWe went back to Kābul with masses of goods and treasure, great honour\r\nand reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. Bābur's marriage with Ma`ṣūma-sulṯān._)\r\n\r\nAfter this return to Kābul I concluded alliance (_`aqd qīldīm_) with Sl.\r\nAḥmad Mīrzā's daughter Ma`ṣūma-sulṯān Begīm whom I had asked in marriage\r\nat Khurāsān, and had had brought from there.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. Shaibāq Khān before Qandahār._)\r\n\r\nA few days later a servant of Nāṣir Mīrzā brought the news that Shaibāq\r\nKhān had come and laid siege to Qandahār. That Muqīm had fled to\r\nZamīn-dāwar has been said already; from there he went on and saw Shaibāq\r\nKhān. From Shāh Beg also one person after another had gone to Shaibāq\r\nKhān. At the instigation and petition of these two, the Khān came\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 213.] swiftly down on Qandahār by the mountain\r\nroad,[1305] thinking to find me there. This was the very thing that\r\nexperienced person Qāsim Beg had in his mind when he worried us into\r\nmarching off from near Qandahār.\r\n\r\n   (Persian) What a mirror shews to the young man,\r\n             A baked brick shews to the old one!\r\n\r\nShaibāq Khān arriving, besieged Nāṣir Mīrzā in Qandahār.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_q. Alarm in Kābul._)\r\n\r\nWhen this news came, the begs were summoned for counsel. The matters for\r\ndiscussion were these:—Strangers and ancient foes, such as are Shaibāq\r\nKhān and the Aūzbegs, are in possession of all the countries once held\r\nby Tīmūr Beg's descendants; even where Turks and Chaghatāīs[1306]\r\nsurvive in corners and border-lands, they have all joined the Aūzbeg,\r\nwillingly or with aversion; one remains, I myself, in Kābul, the foe\r\nmightily strong, I very weak, with no means of making terms, no strength\r\nto oppose; that, in the presence of such power and potency, we had to\r\nthink of some place for ourselves and, at this crisis and in the crack\r\nof time there was, to put a wider space between us and the strong\r\nfoeman; that choice lay between Badakhshān and Hindūstān and that\r\ndecision must now be made.\r\n\r\nQāsim Beg and Sherīm T̤aghāī were agreed for Badakhshān;\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on Badakhshān._) Those holding their heads up\r\n   in Badakhshān at this crisis were, of Badakhshīs, Mubārak Shāh\r\n   and Zubair, Jahāngīr _Turkmān_ and Muḥammad the armourer. They\r\n   had driven Nāṣir Mīrzā out but had not joined the Aūzbeg.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 213b.] I and several household-begs preferred going\r\ntowards Hindūstān and were for making a start to Lamghān.[1307]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_r. Movements of some Mīrzās._)\r\n\r\nAfter taking Qandahār, I had bestowed Qalāt and the Turnūk (Tarnak)\r\ncountry on `Abdu'r-razzāq Mīrzā and had left him in Qalāt, but with the\r\nAūzbeg besieging Qandahār, he could not stay in Qalāt, so left it and\r\ncame to Kābul. He arriving just as we were marching out, was there left\r\nin charge.[1308]\r\n\r\nThere being in Badakhshān no ruler or ruler's son, Mīrzā Khān inclined\r\nto go in that direction, both because of his relationship to Shāh\r\nBegīm[1309] and with her approval. He was allowed to go and the honoured\r\nBegīm herself started off with him. My honoured maternal-aunt Mihr-nigār\r\nKhānīm also wished to go to Badakhshān, notwithstanding that it was more\r\nseemly for her to be with me, a blood-relation; but whatever objection\r\nwas made, she was not to be dissuaded; she also betook[1310] herself to\r\nBadakhshān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_s. Bābur's second start for Hindūstān._)\r\n\r\nUnder our plan of going to Hindūstān, we marched out of Kābul in the\r\nmonth of the first Jumāda (September 1507 AD.), taking the road through\r\nLittle Kābul and going down by Sūrkh-rabāṯ to Qūrūq-sāī.\r\n\r\nThe Afghāns belonging between Kābul and Lamghān (Ningnahār) are thieves\r\nand abettors of thieves even in quiet times; for just such a happening\r\nas this they had prayed in vain. Said they, \"He has abandoned Kābul\",\r\nand multiplied their misdeeds by ten, changing their very merits for\r\nfaults. To such [Sidenote: Fol. 214.] lengths did things go that on the\r\nmorning we marched from Jagdālīk, the Afghāns located between it and\r\nLamghān, such as the Khiẓr-khail, Shimū-khail, Khirilchī and Khūgīanī,\r\nthought of blocking the pass, arrayed on the mountain to the north, and\r\nadvancing with sound of tambour and flourish of sword, began to shew\r\nthemselves off. On our mounting I ordered our men to move along the\r\nmountain-side, each man from where he had dismounted;[1311] off they set\r\nat the gallop up every ridge and every valley of the saddle.[1312] The\r\nAfghāns stood awhile, but could not let even one arrow fly,[1313] and\r\nbetook themselves to flight. While I was on the mountain during the\r\npursuit, I shot one in the hand as he was running back below me. That\r\narrow-stricken man and a few others were brought in; some were put to\r\ndeath by impalement, as an example.\r\n\r\nWe dismounted over against the Adīnapūr-fort in the Nīngnahār _tūmān_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_t. A raid for winter stores._)\r\n\r\nUp till then we had taken no thought where to camp, where to go, where\r\nto stay; we had just marched up and down, camping in fresh places, while\r\nwaiting for news.[1314] It was late in the autumn; most lowlanders had\r\ncarried in their rice. People knowing the local land and water\r\nrepresented that the Mīl Kāfirs up the water of the `Alīshang _tūmān_\r\ngrow great quantities of rice, so that we might be able to collect\r\nwinter supplies from them for the army. Accordingly we rode out of the\r\nNīngnahār dale (_julga_), crossed (the Bārān-water) at Sāīkal, and went\r\nswiftly as far as the Pūr-amīn (easeful) valley. [Sidenote: Fol. 214b.]\r\nThere the soldiers took a mass of rice. The rice-fields were all at the\r\nbottom of the hills. The people fled but some Kāfirs went to their\r\ndeath. A few of our braves had been sent to a look-out (_sar-kūb_)[1315]\r\non a naze of the Pūr-anīm valley; when they were returning to us, the\r\nKāfirs rushed from the hill above, shooting at them. They overtook Qāsim\r\nBeg's son-in-law Pūrān, chopped at him with an axe, and were just taking\r\nhim when some of the braves went back, brought strength to bear, drove\r\nthem off and got Pūrān away. After one night spent in the Kāfirs'\r\nrice-fields, we returned to camp with a mass of provisions collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_u. Marriage of Muqīm's daughter._)\r\n\r\nWhile we were near Mandrāwar in those days, an alliance was concluded\r\nbetween Muqīm's daughter Māh-chūchūk, now married to Shāh Ḥasan\r\n_Arghūn_, and Qāsim Kūkūldāsh.[1316]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_v. Abandonment of the Hindūstān project._)\r\n\r\nAs it was not found desirable to go on into Hindūstān, I sent Mullā Bābā\r\nof Pashāghar back to Kābul with a few braves. Meantime I marched from\r\nnear Mandrāwar to Atar and Shīwa and lay there for a few days. From Atar\r\nI visited Kūnār and Nūr-gal; from Kūnār I went back to camp on a raft;\r\nit was the first time I had sat on one; it pleased me much, and the raft\r\ncame into common use thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_w. Shaibāq Khān retires from Qandahār._)\r\n\r\nIn those same days Mullā Bābā of Farkat came from Nāṣir Mīrzā with news\r\nin detail that Shaibāq Khān, after taking the outer-fort of Qandahār,\r\nhad not been able to take the citadel but had retired; also that the\r\nMīrzā, on various accounts, had left Qandahār and gone to Ghaznī.\r\n\r\nShaibāq Khān's arrival before Qandahār, within a few days [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 215.] of our own departure, had taken the garrison by surprise, and\r\nthey had not been able to make fast the outer-fort. He ran mines several\r\ntimes round about the citadel and made several assaults. The place was\r\nabout to be lost. At that anxious time Khwāja Muḥ. Amīn, Khwāja Dost\r\nKhāwand, Muḥ. `Alī, a foot-soldier, and Shāmī (Syrian?) let themselves\r\ndown from the walls and got away. Just as those in the citadel were\r\nabout to surrender in despair, Shaibāq Khān interposed words of peace\r\nand uprose from before the place. Why he rose was this:—It appears that\r\nbefore he went there, he had sent his _ḥaram_ to Nīrah-tū,[1317] and\r\nthat in Nīrah-tū some-one lifted up his head and got command in the\r\nfort; the Khān therefore made a sort of peace and retired from Qandahār.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_x. Bābur returns to Kābul._)\r\n\r\nMid-winter though it was we went back to Kābul by the Bād-i-pīch road. I\r\nordered the date of that transit and that crossing of the pass to be cut\r\non a stone above Bād-i-pīch;[1318] Ḥāfiẓ Mīrak wrote the inscription,\r\nUstād Shāh Muḥammad did the cutting, not well though, through haste.\r\n\r\nI bestowed Ghaznī on Nāṣir Mīrzā and gave `Abdu'r-razzāq Mīrzā the\r\nNīngnahār _tūmān_ with Mandrāwar, Nūr-valley, Kūnār and Nūr-gal.[1319]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_y. Bābur styles himself Pādshāh._)\r\n\r\nUp to that date people had styled Tīmūr Beg's descendants _Mīrzā_, even\r\nwhen they were ruling; now I ordered that people should style me\r\n_Pādshāh_.[1320]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_z. Birth of Bābur's first son._)\r\n\r\nAt the end of this year, on Tuesday the 4th day of the month of\r\nẔū'l-qa`da (March 6th 1506 AD.), the Sun being in Pisces [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n215b.] (_Ḥūt_), Humāyūn was born in the citadel of Kābul. The date of\r\nhis birth was found by the poet Maulānā Masnadī in the words _Sulṯān\r\nHumāyūn Khān_,[1321] and a minor poet of Kābul found it in\r\n_Shāh-i-fīrūs-qadr_ (Shāh of victorious might). A few days later he\r\nreceived the name Humāyūn; when he was five or six days old, I went out\r\nto the Chār-bāgh where was had the feast of his nativity. All the begs,\r\nsmall and great, brought gifts; such a mass of white _tankas_ was heaped\r\nup as had never been seen before. It was a first-rate feast!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n914 AH.—MAY 2ND 1508 TO APRIL 21ST 1509 AD.[1322]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis spring a body of Mahmand Afghāns was over-run near Muqur.[1323]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. A Mughūl rebellion._)\r\n\r\nA few days after our return from that raid, Qūj Beg, Faqīr-i-`alī,\r\nKarīm-dād and Bābā _chuhra_ were thinking about deserting, but their\r\ndesign becoming known, people were sent who took them below Astar-ghach.\r\nAs good-for-nothing words of theirs had been reported to me, even during\r\nJahāngīr M.'s life-time,[1324] I ordered that they should be put to\r\ndeath at the top of the _bāzār_. They had been taken to the place; the\r\nropes had been fixed; and they were about to be hanged when Qāsim Beg\r\nsent Khalīfa to me with an urgent entreaty that I would pardon their\r\noffences. To please him I gave them their lives, but I ordered them kept\r\nin custody.\r\n\r\nWhat there was of Khusrau Shāh's retainers from Ḥiṣār and Qūndūz,\r\ntogether with the head-men of the Mughūls, Chilma, [Sidenote: Fol. 216.]\r\n`Alī Sayyid,[1325] Sakma (?), Sher-qulī and Aīkū-sālam (?), and also\r\nKhusrau Shāh's favourite Chaghatāī retainers under Sl. `Alī _chuhra_ and\r\nKhudabakhsh, with also 2 or 3000 serviceable Turkmān braves led by\r\nSīūndūk and Shāh Naẕar,[1326] the whole of these, after consultation,\r\ntook up a bad position towards me. They were all seated in front of\r\nKhwāja Riwāj, from the Sūng-qūrghān meadow to the Chālāk; `Abdu'r-razzāq\r\nMīrzā, come in from Nīng-nahār, being in Dih-i-afghān.[1327]\r\n\r\nEarlier on Muḥibb-i-`alī the armourer had told Khalīfa and Mullā Bābā\r\nonce or twice of their assemblies, and both had given me a hint, but the\r\nthing seeming incredible, it had had no attention. One night, towards\r\nthe Bed-time Prayer, when I was sitting in the Audience-hall of the\r\nChār-bāgh, Mūsa Khwāja, coming swiftly up with another man, said in my\r\near, \"The Mughūls are really rebelling! We do not know for certain\r\nwhether they have got `Abdu'r-razzāq M. to join them. They have\r\nnot settled to rise to-night.\" I feigned disregard and a little\r\nlater went towards the _ḥarams_ which at the time were in the\r\nYūrūnchqa-garden[1328] and the Bāgh-i-khilwat, but after page, servitor\r\nand messenger (_yasāwal_) had turned back on getting [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n216b.] near them, I went with the chief-slave towards the town, and on\r\nalong the ditch. I had gone as far as the Iron-gate when Khwāja Muḥ.\r\n`Alī[1329] met me, he coming by the _bāzār_ road from the opposite\r\ndirection. He joined me ... of the porch of the Hot-bath\r\n(_ḥammām_)....[1330]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S NOTE ON 914 TO 925 AH.—1508 TO 1519 AD.\r\n\r\nFrom several references made in the _Bābur-nāma_ and from a passage in\r\nGul-badan's _Humāyūn-nāma_ (f. 15), it is inferrible that Bābur was\r\ncomposing the annals of 914 AH. not long before his last illness and\r\ndeath.[1331]\r\n\r\nBefore the diary of 925 AH. (1519 AD.) takes up the broken thread of his\r\nautobiography, there is a _lacuna_ of narrative extending over nearly\r\neleven years. The break was not intended, several references in the\r\n_Bābur-nāma_ shewing Bābur's purpose to describe events of the\r\nunchronicled years.[1332] Mr. Erskine, in the Leyden and Erskine\r\n_Memoirs_, carried Bābur's biography through the major _lacunæ_, but\r\nwithout firsthand help from the best sources, the _Habību's-siyar_ and\r\n_Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_. He had not the help of the first even in his\r\n_History of India_. M. de Courteille working as a translator only, made\r\nno attempt to fill the gaps.\r\n\r\nBābur's biography has yet to be completed; much time is demanded by the\r\ntask, not only in order to exhaust known sources and seek others further\r\nafield, but to weigh and balance the contradictory statements of writers\r\ndeep-sundered in sympathy and outlook. To strike such a balance is\r\nessential when dealing with the events of 914 to 920 AH. because in\r\nthose years Bābur had part in an embittered conflict between Sunni and\r\nShī`a. What I offer below, as a stop-gap, is a mere summary of events,\r\nmainly based on material not used by Mr. Erskine, with a few comments\r\nprompted by acquaintance with Bāburiana.\r\n\r\n\r\n_USEFUL SOURCES_\r\n\r\nCompared with what Bābur could have told of this most interesting period\r\nof his life, the yield of the sources is scant, a natural sequel from\r\nthe fact that no one of them had his biography for its main theme, still\r\nless had his own action in crises of enforced ambiguity.\r\n\r\nOf all known sources the best are Khwānd-amīr's _Ḥabību's-siyar_ and\r\nḤaidar Mīrzā _Dūghlāt's Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_. The first was finished\r\nnominally in 930 AH. (1524-5 AD.), seven years therefore before Bābur's\r\ndeath, but it received much addition of matter concerning Bābur after\r\nits author went to Hindūstān in 934 AH. (f. 339). Its fourth part, a\r\nlife of Shāh Ismā`īl _Ṣafawī_ is especially valuable for the years of\r\nthis _lacuna_. Ḥaidar's book was finished under Humāyūn in 953 AH. (1547\r\nAD.), when its author had reigned five years in Kashmīr. It is the most\r\nvaluable of all the sources for those interested in Bābur himself, both\r\nbecause of Ḥaidar's excellence as a biographer, and through his close\r\nacquaintance with Bābur's family. From his eleventh to his thirteenth\r\nyear he lived under Bābur's protection, followed this by 19 years\r\nservice under Sa`īd Khān, the cousin of both, in Kāshghar, and after\r\nthat Khān's death, went to Bābur's sons Kāmrān and Humāyūn in Hindūstān.\r\n\r\nA work issuing from a Sunnī Aūzbeg centre, Faẓl bin Ruzbahān _Isfahānī's\r\nSūlūku'l-mulūk_, has a Preface of special value, as shewing one view of\r\nwhat it writes of as the spread of heresy in Māwarā'u'n-nahr through\r\nBābur's invasions. The book itself is a Treatise on Musalmān Law, and\r\nwas prepared by order of `Ubaidu'l-lāh Khān _Aūzbeg_ for his help in\r\nfulfilling a vow he had made, before attacking Bābur in 918 AH., at the\r\nshrine of Khwāja Aḥmad _Yasawī_ [in Haẓrat Turkistān], that, if he were\r\nvictorious, he would conform exactly with the divine Law and uphold it\r\nin Māwarā'u'n-nahr (Rieu's Pers. Cat. ii, 448).\r\n\r\nThe _Tārīkh-i Ḥājī Muḥammad `Ārif Qandahārī_ appears, from the frequent\r\nuse Firishta made of it, to be a useful source, both because its author\r\nwas a native of Qandahār, a place much occupying Bābur's activities, and\r\nbecause he was a servant of Bairām Khān-i-khānān, whose assassination\r\nunder Akbar he witnessed.[1333] Unfortunately, though his life of Akbar\r\nsurvives no copy is now known of the section of his General History\r\nwhich deals with Bābur's.\r\n\r\nAn early source is Yahya _Kazwīnī's Lubbu't-tawārīkh_, written in 948\r\nAH. (1541 AD.), but brief only in the Bābur period. It issued from a\r\nShī`a source, being commanded by Shāh Ismā`īl _Ṣafawī_'s son Bahrām.\r\n\r\nAnother work issuing also from a _Ṣafawī_ centre is Mīr Sikandar's\r\n_Tārīkh-i-`ālam-arāī_, a history of Shāh `Abbas I, with an introduction\r\ntreating of his predecessors which was completed in 1025 AH. (1616 AD.).\r\nIts interest lies in its outlook on Bābur's dealings with Shāh Ismā`īl.\r\n\r\nA later source, brief only, is Firishta's _Tārīkh-i-firishta_, finished\r\nunder Jahāngīr in the first quarter of the 17th century.\r\n\r\nMr. Erskine makes frequent reference to Kh(w)āfī Khān's _Tārīkh_, a\r\nsecondary authority however, written under Aurangzīb, mainly based on\r\nFirishta's work, and merely summarizing Bābur's period. References to\r\ndetached incidents of the period are found in Shaikh `Abdu'l-qādir's\r\n_Tārīkh-i-badāyūnī_ and Mīr Ma`ṣūm's _Tārīkh-i-sind_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_EVENTS OF THE UNCHRONICLED YEARS_\r\n\r\n914 AH.-MAY 2ND 1508 TO APRIL 21ST 1509 AD.\r\n\r\nThe mutiny, of which an account begins in the text, was crushed by the\r\nvictory of 500 loyalists over 3,000 rebels, one factor of success being\r\nBābur's defeat in single combat of five champions of his\r\nadversaries.[1334] The disturbance was not of long duration; Kābul was\r\ntranquil in Sha`bān (November) when Sl. Sa`īd Khān _Chaghatāī_, then 21,\r\narrived there seeking his cousin's protection, after defeat by his\r\nbrother Manṣūr at Almātū, escape from death, commanded by Shaibānī, in\r\nFarghāna, a winter journey through Qarā-tīgīn to Mīrzā Khān in\r\nQilā'-i-ẓafar, refusal of an offer to put him in that feeble Mīrzā's\r\nplace, and so on to Kābul, where he came a destitute fugitive and\r\nenjoyed a freedom from care never known by him before (f. 200_b_; T.R.\r\np. 226). The year was fatal to his family and to Ḥaidar's; in it\r\nShaibānī murdered Sl. Maḥmūd Khān and his six sons, Muḥammad Ḥusain\r\nMīrzā and other Dūghlāt sulṯāns.\r\n\r\n\r\n915 AH.-APRIL 21ST 1509 TO APRIL 11TH 1510 AD.\r\n\r\nIn this year hostilities began between Shāh Ismā`īl _Ṣafawī_ and Muḥ.\r\nShaibānī Khān _Aūzbeg_, news of which must have excited keen interest in\r\nKābul.\r\n\r\nIn it occurred also what was in itself a minor matter of a child's\r\nsafety, but became of historical importance, namely, the beginning of\r\npersonal acquaintance between Bābur and his sympathetic biographer\r\nḤaidar Mīrzā _Dūghlāt_. Ḥaidar, like Sa`īd, came a fugitive to the\r\nprotection of a kinsman; he was then eleven, had been saved by servants\r\nfrom the death commanded by Shaibānī, conveyed to Mīrzā Khān in\r\nBadakhshān, thence sent for by Bābur to the greater security of Kābul\r\n(f. 11; Index _s.n._; T.R. p. 227).\r\n\r\n\r\n916 AH.-APRIL 11TH 1510 TO MARCH 31ST 1510 AD.\r\n\r\n_a. News of the battle of Merv._\r\n\r\nOver half of this year passed quietly in Kābul; Ramẓān (December)\r\nbrought from Mīrzā Khān (Wāis) the stirring news that Ismā`īl had\r\ndefeated Shaibānī near Merv.[1335] \"It is not known,\" wrote the Mīrzā,\r\n\"whether Shāhī Beg Khān has been killed or not. All the Aūzbegs have\r\ncrossed the Amū. Amīr Aūrūs, who was in Qūndūz, has fled. About 20,000\r\nMughūls, who left the Aūzbeg at Merv, have come to Qūndūz. I have come\r\nthere.\" He then invited Bābur to join him and with him to try for the\r\nrecovery of their ancestral territories (T.R. p. 237).\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Bābur's campaign in Transoxiana begun._\r\n\r\nThe Mīrzā's letter was brought over passes blocked by snow; Bābur, with\r\nall possible speed, took the one winter-route through Āb-dara, kept the\r\nRamẓān Feast in Bāmīān, and reached Qūndūz in Shawwāl (Jan. 1511 AD.).\r\nḤaidar's detail about the Feast seems likely to have been recorded\r\nbecause he had read Bābur's own remark, made in Ramẓān 933 AH. (June\r\n1527) that up to that date, when he kept it in Sīkrī, he had not since\r\nhis eleventh year kept it twice in the same place (f. 330).\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Mughūl affairs._\r\n\r\nOutside Qūndūz lay the Mughūls mentioned by Mīrzā Khān as come from Merv\r\nand so mentioned, presumably, as a possible reinforcement. They had been\r\nservants of Bābur's uncles Maḥmūd and Aḥmad, and when Shaibānī defeated\r\nthose Khāns at Akhsī in 908 AH., had been compelled by him to migrate\r\ninto Khurāsān to places remote from Mughūlistān. Many of them had served\r\nin Kāshghar; none had served a Tīmūrid Mīrzā. Set free by Shaibānī's\r\ndeath, they had come east, a Khān-less 20,000 of armed and fully\r\nequipped men and they were there, as Ḥaidar says, in their strength\r\nwhile of Chaghatāīs there were not more than 5,000. They now, and with\r\nthem the Mughūls from Kābul, used the opportunity offering for return to\r\na more congenial location and leadership, by the presence in Qūndūz of a\r\nlegitimate Khāqān and the clearance in Andijān, a threshold of\r\nMughūlistān, of its Aūzbeg governors (f. 200_b_). The chiefs of both\r\nbodies of Mughūls, Sherīm Taghāī at the head of one, Ayūb _Begchīk_ of\r\nthe other, proffered the Mughūl Khānship to Sa`īd with offer to set\r\nBābur aside, perhaps to kill him. It is improbable that in making their\r\noffer they contemplated locating themselves in the confined country of\r\nKābul; what they seem to have wished was what Bābur gave, Sa`īd for\r\ntheir Khāqān and permission to go north with him.\r\n\r\nSa`īd, in words worth reading, rejected their offer to injure Bābur,\r\ndoing so on the grounds of right and gratitude, but, the two men\r\nagreeing that it was now expedient for them to part, asked to be sent to\r\nact for Bābur where their friendship could be maintained for their\r\ncommon welfare. The matter was settled by Bābur's sending him into\r\nAndijān in response to an urgent petition for help there just arrived\r\nfrom Ḥaidar's uncle. He \"was made Khān\" and started forth in the\r\nfollowing year, on Ṣafar 14th 917 AH. (May 13th 1511 AD.); with him went\r\nmost of the Mughūls but not all, since even of those from Merv, Ayūb\r\n_Begchīk_ and others are found mentioned on several later occasions as\r\nbeing with Bābur.\r\n\r\nBābur's phrase \"I made him Khān\" (f. 200_b_) recalls his earlier mention\r\nof what seems to be the same appointment (f. 10_b_), made by Abū-sa`īd\r\nof Yūnas as Khān of the Mughūls; in each case the meaning seems to be\r\nthat the Tīmūrid Mīrzā made the Chaghatāī Khān Khāqān of the Mughūls.\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. First attempt on Ḥiṣār._\r\n\r\nAfter spending a short time in Qūndūz, Bābur moved for Ḥiṣār in which\r\nwere the Aūzbeg sulṯāns Mahdī and Ḥamza. They came out into Wakhsh to\r\nmeet him but, owing to an imbroglio, there was no encounter and each\r\nside retired (T.R. p. 238).\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. Intercourse between Bābur and Ismā`īl Ṣafawī._\r\n\r\nWhile Bābur was now in Qūndūz his sister Khān-zāda arrived there,\r\nsafe-returned under escort of the Shāh's troops, after the death in the\r\nbattle of Merv of her successive husbands Shaibānī and Sayyid Hādī, and\r\nwith her came an envoy from Ismā`īl proffering friendship, civilities\r\ncalculated to arouse a hope of Persian help in Bābur. To acknowledge his\r\ncourtesies, Bābur sent Mīrzā Khān with thanks and gifts; Ḥaidar says\r\nthat the Mīrzā also conveyed protestations of good faith and a request\r\nfor military assistance. He was well received and his request for help\r\nwas granted; that it was granted under hard conditions then stated later\r\noccurrences shew.\r\n\r\n\r\n917 AH.-MARCH 31ST 1511 TO MARCH 19TH 1512 AD.\r\n\r\n_a. Second attempt on Ḥiṣār._\r\n\r\nIn this year Bābur moved again on Ḥiṣār. He took post, where once his\r\nforbear Tīmūr had wrought out success against great odds, at the\r\nPul-i-sangīn (Stone-bridge) on the Sūrkh-āb, and lay there a month\r\nawaiting reinforcement. The Aūzbeg sulṯāns faced him on the other side\r\nof the river, they too, presumably, awaiting reinforcement. They moved\r\nwhen they felt themselves strong enough to attack, whether by addition\r\nto their own numbers, whether by learning that Bābur had not largely\r\nincreased his own. Concerning the second alternative it is open to\r\nsurmise that he hoped for larger reinforcement than he obtained; he\r\nappears to have left Qūndūz before the return of Mīrzā Khān from his\r\nembassy to Ismā`īl, to have expected Persian reinforcement with the\r\nMīrzā, and at Pul-i-sangīn, where the Mīrzā joined him in time to fight,\r\nto have been strengthened by the Mīrzā's own following, and few, if any,\r\nforeign auxiliaries. These surmises are supported by what Khwānd-amīr\r\nrelates of the conditions [specified later] on which the Shāh's main\r\ncontingent was despatched and by his shewing that it did not start until\r\nafter the Shāh had had news of the battle at Pul-i-sangīn.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the month of waiting, the Aūzbegs one morning swam the\r\nSūrkh-āb below the bridge; in the afternoon of the same day, Bābur\r\nretired to better ground amongst the mountain fastnesses of a local\r\nĀb-dara. In the desperate encounter which followed the Aūzbegs were\r\nutterly routed with great loss in men; they were pursued to\r\nDarband-i-ahanīn (Iron-gate) on the Ḥiṣār border, on their way to join a\r\ngreat force assembled at Qarshī under Kūchūm Khān, Shaibānī's successor\r\nas Aūzbeg Khāqān. The battle is admirably described by Ḥaidar, who was\r\nthen a boy of 12 with keen eye watching his own first fight, and that\r\nfight with foes who had made him the last male survivor of his line. In\r\nthe evening of the victory Mahdī, Ḥamza and Ḥamza's son Mamak were\r\nbrought before Bābur who, says Ḥaidar, did to them what they had done to\r\nthe Mughūl Khāqāns and Chaghatāī Sulṯāns, that is, he retaliated in\r\nblood for the blood of many kinsmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Persian reinforcement._\r\n\r\nAfter the battle Bābur went to near Ḥiṣār, was there joined by many\r\nlocal tribesmen, and, some time later, by a large body of Ismā`īl's\r\ntroops under Aḥmad Beg _Ṣafawī_, `Alī Khān _Istiljū_ and Shāhrukh Sl.\r\n_Afshār_, Ismā`īl's seal-keeper. The following particulars, given by\r\nKhwānd-amīr, about the despatch of this contingent help to fix the order\r\nof occurrences, and throw light on the price paid by Bābur for his\r\nauxiliaries. He announced his victory over Mahdī and Ḥamza to the Shāh,\r\nand at the same time promised that if he reconquered the rest of\r\nTransoxiana by the Shāh's help, he would read his name in the _khuṯba_,\r\nstamp it on coins together with those of the Twelve Imāms, and work to\r\ndestroy the power of the Aūzbegs. These undertakings look like a\r\nresponse to a demand; such conditions cannot have been proffered; their\r\nacceptance must have been compelled. Khwānd-amīr says that when Ismā`īl\r\nfully understood the purport of Bābur's letter, [by which would seem to\r\nbe meant, when he knew that his conditions of help were accepted,] he\r\ndespatched the troops under the three Commanders named above.\r\n\r\nThe Persian chiefs advised a move direct on Bukhārā and Samarkand; and\r\nwith this Bābur's councillors concurred, they saying, according to\r\nḤaidar, that Bukhārā was then empty of troops and full of fools. `Ubaid\r\nKhān had thrown himself into Qarshī; it was settled not to attack him\r\nbut to pass on and encamp a stage beyond the town. This was done; then\r\nscout followed scout, bringing news that he had come out of Qarshī and\r\nwas hurrying to Bukhārā, his own fief. Instant and swift pursuit\r\nfollowed him up the 100 miles of caravan-road, into Bukhārā, and on\r\nbeyond, sweeping him and his garrison, plundered as they fled, into the\r\nopen land of Turkistān. Many sulṯāns had collected in Samarkand, some no\r\ndoubt being, like Tīmūr its governor, fugitives escaped from\r\nPul-i-sangīn. Dismayed by Bābur's second success, they scattered into\r\nTurkistān, thus leaving him an open road.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Samarkand re-occupied and relations with Ismā`īl Ṣafawī._\r\n\r\nHe must now have hoped to be able to dispense with his dangerous\r\ncolleagues, for he dismissed them when he reached Bukhārā, with gifts\r\nand thanks for their services. It is Ḥaidar, himself present, who fixes\r\nBukhārā as the place of the dismissal (T.R. p. 246).\r\n\r\nFrom Bukhārā Bābur went to Samarkand. It was mid-Rajab 917 AH. (October\r\n1511 AD.), some ten months after leaving Kābul, and after 9 years of\r\nabsence, that he re-entered the town, itself gay with decoration for his\r\nwelcome, amidst the acclaim of its people.[1336]\r\n\r\nEight months were to prove his impotence to keep it against the forces\r\nranged against him,—Aūzbeg strength in arms compacted by Sunnī zeal,\r\nSunnī hatred of a Shī`a's suzerainty intensified by dread lest that\r\npotent Shī`a should resolve to perpetuate his dominance. Both as a Sunnī\r\nand as one who had not owned a suzerain, the position was unpleasant for\r\nBābur. That his alliance with Ismā`īl was dangerous he will have known,\r\nas also that his risks grew as Transoxiana was over-spread by news of\r\nIsmā`īl's fanatical barbarism to pious and learned Sunnīs, notably in\r\nHerī. He manifested desire for release both now and later,—now when he\r\nnot only dismissed his Persian helpers but so behaved to the Shāh's\r\nenvoy Muḥammad Jān,—he was Najm S̤ānī's Lord of the Gate,—that the envoy\r\nfelt neglect and made report of Bābur as arrogant, in opposition, and\r\nunwilling to fulfil his compact,—later when he eagerly attempted success\r\nunaided against `Ubaid Khān, and was then worsted. It illustrates the\r\nShāh's view of his suzerain relation to Bābur that on hearing Muḥammad\r\nJān's report, he ordered Najm S̤ānī to bring the offender to order.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Shāh's conditions seem to have been carried out in\r\nSamarkand and Bābur's subservience clearly shewn.[1337] Of this there\r\nare the indications,—that Bābur had promised and was a man of his word;\r\nthat Sunnī irritation against him waxed and did not wane as it might\r\nhave done without food to nourish it; that Bābur knew himself impotent\r\nagainst the Aūzbegs unless he had foreign aid, expected attack, knew it\r\nwas preparing; that he would hear of Muḥammad Jān's report and of Najm\r\nS̤ānī's commission against himself. Honesty, policy and necessity\r\ncombined to enforce the fulfilment of his agreement. What were the\r\nprecise terms of that agreement beyond the two as to the _khuṯba_ and\r\nthe coins, it needs close study of the wording of the sources to decide,\r\nlest metaphor be taken for fact. Great passions,—ambition, religious\r\nfervour, sectarian bigotry and fear confronted him. His problem was\r\ngreater than that of Henry of Navarre and of Napoleon in Egypt; they had\r\nbut to seem what secured their acceptance; he had to put on a guise that\r\nbrought him hate.\r\n\r\nKhān-zāda was not the only member of Bābur's family who now rejoined him\r\nafter marriage with an Aūzbeg. His half-sister Yādgār-sulṯān had fallen\r\nto the share of Ḥamza Sulṯān's son `Abdu'l-laṯīf in 908 AH. when\r\nShaibānī defeated the Khāns near Akhsī. Now that her half-brother had\r\ndefeated her husband's family, she returned to her own people (f. 9).\r\n\r\n\r\n918 AH.-MARCH 19TH 1512 TO MARCH 9TH 1513 AD.\r\n\r\n_a. Return of the Aūzbegs._\r\n\r\nEmboldened by the departure of the Persian troops, the Aūzbegs, in the\r\nspring of the year, came out of Turkistān, their main attack being\r\ndirected on Tāshkīnt, then held for Bābur.[1338] `Ubaid Khān moved for\r\nBukhārā. He had prefaced his march by vowing that, if successful, he\r\nwould thenceforth strictly observe Musalmān Law. The vow was made in\r\nḤaẓrat Turkistān at the shrine of Khwāja Aḥmad _Yasawī_, a saint revered\r\nin Central Asia through many centuries; he had died about 1120 AD.;\r\nTīmūr had made pilgrimage to his tomb, in 1397 AD., and then had founded\r\nthe mosque still dominating the town, still the pilgrim's\r\nland-mark.[1339] `Ubaid's vow, like Bābur's of 933 AH., was one of\r\nreturn to obedience. Both men took oath in the Ghāzī's mood, Bābur's set\r\nagainst the Hindū whom he saw as a heathen, `Ubaid's set against Bābur\r\nwhom he saw as a heretic.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Bābur's defeat at Kul-i-malik._\r\n\r\nIn Ṣafar (April-May) `Ubaid moved swiftly down and attacked the Bukhārā\r\nneighbourhood. Bābur went from Samarkand to meet him. Several details of\r\nwhat followed, not given by Ḥaidar and, in one particular, contradicting\r\nhim, are given by Khwānd-amīr. The statement in which the two historians\r\ncontradict one another is Ḥaidar's that `Ubaid had 3000 men only, Bābur\r\n40,000. Several considerations give to Khwānd-amīr's opposed statement\r\nthat Bābur's force was small, the semblance of being nearer the fact.\r\nḤaidar, it may be said, did not go out on this campaign; he was ill in\r\nSamarkand and continued ill there for some time; Khwānd-amīr's details\r\nhave the well-informed air of things learned at first-hand, perhaps from\r\nsome-one in Hindūstān after 934 AH.\r\n\r\nMatters which make against Bābur's having a large effective force at\r\nKul-i-malik, and favour Khwānd-amīr's statement about the affair are\r\nthese:—`Ubaid must have formed some estimate of what he had to meet, and\r\nhe brought 3000 men. Where could Bābur have obtained 40,000 men worth\r\nreckoning in a fight? In several times of crisis his own immediate and\r\never-faithful troop is put at 500; as his cause was now unpopular, local\r\naccretions may have been few. Some Mughūls from Merv and from Kābul were\r\nnear Samarkand (T.R. pp. 263, 265); most were with Sa`īd in Andijān; but\r\nhowever many Mughūls may have been in his neighbourhood, none could be\r\ncounted on as resolute for his success. If too, he had had more than a\r\nsmall effective force, would he not have tried to hold Samarkand with\r\nthe remnant of defeat until Persian help arrived? All things considered,\r\nthere is ground for accepting Khwānd-amīr's statement that Bābur met\r\n`Ubaid with a small force.\r\n\r\nFollowing his account therefore:—Bābur in his excess of daring, marched\r\nto put the Aūzbeg down with a small force only, against the advice of\r\nthe prudent, of whom Muḥammad Mazīd Tarkhān was one, who all said it was\r\nwrong to go out unprepared and without reinforcement. Paying them no\r\nattention, Bābur marched for Bukhārā, was rendered still more daring by\r\nnews had when he neared it, that the enemy had retired some stages, and\r\nfollowed him up almost to his camp. `Ubaid was in great force; many\r\nAūzbegs perished but, in the end, they were victors and Bābur was\r\ncompelled to take refuge in Bukhārā. The encounter took place near\r\nKul-i-malik (King's-lake) in Ṣafar 918 AH. (April-May 1512 AD.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Bābur leaves Samarkand._\r\n\r\nIt was not possible to maintain a footing in Samarkand; Bābur therefore\r\ncollected his family and train[1340] and betook himself to Ḥiṣār. There\r\nwent with him on this expedition Māhīm and her children Humāyūn,\r\nMihr-jahān and Bārbūl,—the motherless Ma`ṣūma,—Gul-rukh with her son\r\nKāmrān (Gulbadan f. 7). I have not found any account of his route;\r\nḤaidar gives no details about the journey; he did not travel with Bābur,\r\nbeing still invalided in Samarkand. Perhaps the absence of information\r\nis a sign that the Aūzbegs had not yet appeared on the direct road for\r\nḤiṣār. A local tradition however would make Bābur go round through\r\nFarghāna. He certainly might have gone into Farghāna hoping to\r\nco-operate with Sa`īd Khān; Tāshkīnt was still holding out under\r\nAḥmad-i-qāsim _Kohbur_ and it is clear that all activity in Bābur's\r\nforce had not been quenched because during the Tāshkīnt siege, Dost Beg\r\nbroke through the enemy's ranks and made his way into the town. Sairām\r\nheld out longer than Tāshkīnt. Of any such move by Bābur into Andijān\r\nthe only hint received is given by what may be a mere legend.[1341]\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. Bābur in Ḥiṣār._\r\n\r\nAfter experiencing such gains and such losses, Bābur was still under 30\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nThe Aūzbegs, after his departure, re-occupied Bukhārā and Samarkand\r\nwithout harm done to the towns-people, and a few weeks later, in Jumāda\r\nI (July-August) followed him to Ḥiṣār. Meantime he with Mīrzā Khān's\r\nhelp, had so closed the streets of the town by massive earth-works that\r\nthe sulṯāns were convinced its defenders were ready to spend the last\r\ndrop of their blood in holding it, and therefore retired without\r\nattack.[1342] Some sources give as their reason for retirement that\r\nBābur had been reinforced from Balkh; Bairām Beg, it is true, had sent a\r\nforce but one of 300 men only; so few cannot have alarmed except as the\r\nharbinger of more. Greater precision as to dates would shew whether they\r\ncan have heard of Najm S̤ānī's army advancing by way of Balkh.\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. Qarshī and Ghaj-davān._\r\n\r\nMeantime Najm S̤ānī, having with him some 11,000 men, had started on his\r\ncorrective mission against Bābur. When he reached the Khurāsān frontier,\r\nhe heard of the defeat at Kul-i-malik and the flight to Ḥiṣār, gathered\r\nother troops from Harāt and elsewhere, and advanced to Balkh. He stayed\r\nthere for 20 days with Bairām Beg, perhaps occupied, in part, by\r\ncommunications with the Shāh and Bābur. From the latter repeated request\r\nfor help is said to have come; help was given, some sources say without\r\nthe Shāh's permission. A rendezvous was fixed, Najm S̤ānī marched to\r\nTīrmīẕ, there crossed the Amū and in Rajab (Sep.-Oct.) encamped near the\r\nDarband-i-ahanīn. On Bābur's approach through the Chak-chaq pass, he\r\npaid him the civility of going several miles out from his camp to give\r\nhim honouring reception.\r\n\r\nAdvancing thence for Bukhārā, the combined armies took Khuzār and moved\r\non to Qarshī. This town Bābur wished to pass by, as it had been passed\r\nby on his previous march for Bukhārā; each time perhaps he wished to\r\nspare its people, formerly his subjects, whom he desired to rule again,\r\nand who are reputed to have been mostly his fellow Turks. Najm S̤ānī\r\nrefused to pass on; he said Qarshī must be taken because it was\r\n`Ubaidu'l-lāh Khān's nest; in it was `Ubaid's uncle Shaikhīm Mīrzā; it\r\nwas captured; the Aūzbeg garrison was put to the sword and, spite of\r\nBābur's earnest entreaties, all the towns-people, 15,000 persons it is\r\nsaid, down to the \"suckling and decrepit\", were massacred. Amongst the\r\nvictims was Banā'ī who happened to be within it. This action roused the\r\nutmost anger against Najm S̤ānī; it disgusted Bābur, not only through\r\nits merciless slaughter but because it made clear the disregard in which\r\nhe was held by his magnificent fellow-general.\r\n\r\nFrom murdered Qarshī Najm S̤ānī advanced for Bukhārā. On getting within\r\na few miles of it, he heard that an Aūzbeg force was approaching under\r\nTīmūr and Abū-sa`īd, presumably from Samarkand therefore. He sent Bairām\r\nBeg to attack them; they drew off to the north and threw themselves into\r\nGhaj-davān, the combined armies following them. This move placed Najm\r\nS̤ānī across the Zar-afshān, on the border of the desert with which the\r\nAūzbegs were familiar, and with `Ubaid on his flank in Bukhārā.\r\n\r\nAs to what followed the sources vary; they are brief; they differ less\r\nin statement of the same occurrence than in their choice of details to\r\nrecord; as Mr. Erskine observes their varying stories are not\r\nincompatible. Their widest difference is a statement of time but the two\r\nperiods named, one a few days, the other four months, may not be meant\r\nto apply to the same event. Four months the siege is said to have\r\nlasted; this could not have been said if it had been a few days only.\r\nThe siege seems to have been of some duration.\r\n\r\nAt first there were minor engagements, ending with varying success;\r\nprovisions and provender became scarce; Najm S̤ānī's officers urged\r\nretirement, so too did Bābur. He would listen to none of them. At length\r\n`Ubaid Khān rode out from Bukhārā at the head of excellent troops; he\r\njoined the Ghaj-davān garrison and the united Aūzbegs posted themselves\r\nin the suburbs where walled lanes and gardens narrowed the field and\r\nlessened Najm S̤ānī's advantage in numbers. On Tuesday Ramẓān 3rd (Nov.\r\n12th)[1343] a battle was fought in which his army was routed and he\r\nhimself slain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_f. Bābur and Yār-i-aḥmad Najm Sānī._\r\n\r\nSome writers say that Najm S̤ānī's men did not fight well; it must be\r\nremembered that they may have been weakened by privation and that they\r\nhad wished to retire. Of Bābur it is said that he, who was the reserve,\r\ndid not fight at all; it is difficult to see good cause why, under all\r\nthe circumstances, he should risk the loss of his men. It seems likely\r\nthat Ḥaidar's strong language about this defeat would suit Bābur's\r\ntemper also. \"The victorious breezes of Islām overturned the banners of\r\nthe schismatics.... Most of them perished on the field; the rents made\r\nby the sword at Qarshī were sewn up at Ghaj-davān by the arrow-stitches\r\nof vengeance. Najm S̤ānī and all the Turkmān amīrs were sent to hell.\"\r\n\r\nThe belief that Bābur had failed Najm S̤ānī persisted at the Persian\r\nCourt, for his inaction was made a reproach to his son Humāyūn in 951\r\nAH. (1544 AD.), when Humāyūn was a refugee with Ismā`īl's son T̤ahmāsp.\r\nBadāyūnī tells a story which, with great inaccuracy of name and place,\r\nrepresents the view taken at that time. The part of the anecdote\r\npertinent here is that Bābur on the eve of the battle at Ghaj-davān,\r\nshot an arrow into the Aūzbeg camp which carried the following couplet,\r\nexpressive of his ill-will to the Shāh and perhaps also of his rejection\r\nof the Shī`a guise he himself had worn.\r\n\r\n   I made the Shāh's Najm road-stuff for the Aūzbegs;\r\n   If fault has been mine, I have now cleansed the road.[1344]\r\n\r\n\r\n_g. The Mughūls attack Bābur._\r\n\r\nOn his second return to Ḥiṣār Bābur was subjected to great danger by a\r\nsudden attack made upon him by the Mughūls where he lay at night in his\r\ncamp outside the town. Firishta says, but without particulars of their\r\noffence, that Bābur had reproached them for their misconduct; the\r\nabsence of detail connecting the affair with the defeat just sustained,\r\nleads to the supposition that their misdeeds were a part of the tyranny\r\nover the country-people punished later by `Ubaidu'l-lāh Khān. Roused\r\nfrom his sleep by the noise of his guards' resistance to the Mughūl\r\nattack, Bābur escaped with difficulty and without a single\r\nattendant[1345] into the fort. The conspirators plundered his camp and\r\nwithdrew to Qarā-tīgīn. He was in no position to oppose them, left a few\r\nmen in Ḥiṣār and went to Mīrzā Khān in Qūndūz.\r\n\r\nAfter he left, Ḥiṣār endured a desolating famine, a phenomenal snowfall\r\nand the ravages of the Mughūls. `Ubaid Khān avenged Bābur on the horde;\r\nhearing of their excesses, he encamped outside the position they had\r\ntaken up in Wakhsh defended by river, hills and snow, waited till a road\r\nthawed, then fell upon them and avenged the year's misery they had\r\ninflicted on the Ḥiṣārīs. Ḥaidar says of them that it was their villainy\r\nlost Ḥiṣār to Bābur and gained it for the Aūzbeg.[1346]\r\n\r\nThese Mughūls had for chiefs men who when Sa`īd went to Andijān, elected\r\nto stay with Bābur. One of the three named by Ḥaidar was Ayūb _Begchīk_.\r\nHe repented his disloyalty; when he lay dying some two years later (920\r\nAH.) in Yāngī-ḥiṣār, he told Sa`īd Khān who visited him, that what was\r\n\"lacerating his bowels and killing him with remorse\", was his\r\nfaithlessness to Bābur in Ḥiṣār, the oath he had broken at the\r\ninstigation of those \"hogs and bears\", the Mughūl chiefs (T.R. p. 315).\r\n\r\nIn this year but before the Mughūl treachery to Bābur, Ḥaidar left him,\r\nstarting in Rajab (Sep.-Oct.) to Sa`id in Andijān and thus making a\r\nbeginning of his 19 years spell of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n919 AH.-MARCH 9TH 1513 TO FEB. 26TH 1514 AD.\r\n\r\nBābur may have spent this year in Khishm (Ḥ.S. iii, 372). During two or\r\nthree months of it, he had one of the Shāh's retainers in his service,\r\nKhwāja Kamālu'd-dīn Maḥmūd, who had fled from Ghaj-davān to Balkh, heard\r\nthere that the Balkhīs favoured an Aūzbeg chief whose coming was\r\nannounced, and therefore went to Bābur. In Jumāda 11 (August), hearing\r\nthat the Aūzbeg sultan had left Balkh, he returned there but was not\r\nadmitted because the Balkhīs feared reprisals for their welcome to the\r\nAūzbeg, a fear which may indicate that he had taken some considerable\r\nreinforcement to Bābur. He went on into Khurāsān and was there killed;\r\nBalkh was recaptured for the Shāh by Deo Sulṯān, a removal from Aūzbeg\r\npossession which helps to explain how Bābur came to be there in 923 AH.\r\n\r\n\r\n920 AH.—FEB. 26TH 1514 TO FEB. 15TH 1515 AD.\r\n\r\nḤaidar writes of Bābur as though he were in Qūndūz this year (TR. p.\r\n263), says that he suffered the greatest misery and want, bore it with\r\nhis accustomed courtesy and patience but, at last, despairing of success\r\nin recovering Ḥiṣār, went back to Kābul. Now it seems to be that he made\r\nthe stay in Khwāst to which he refers later (f. 241_b_) and during which\r\nhis daughter Gul-rang was born, as Gul-badan's chronicle allows known.\r\n\r\nIt was at the end of the year, after the privation of winter therefore,\r\nthat he reached Kābul. When he re-occupied Samarkand in 917 AH., he had\r\ngiven Kābul to his half-brother Nāṣir Mīrzā; the Mīrzā received him now\r\nwith warm welcome and protestations of devotion and respect, spoke of\r\nhaving guarded Kābul for him and asked permission to return to his own\r\nold fief Ghaznī. His behaviour made a deep impression on Bābur; it would\r\nbe felt as a humane touch on the sore of failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n921 AH.—FEB. 15TH 1515 TO FEB. 5TH 1516 AD.\r\n\r\n_a. Rebellion of chiefs in Ghaznī._\r\n\r\nNāṣir Mīrzā died shortly after (_dar hamān ayyām_) his return to Ghaznī.\r\nDisputes then arose amongst the various commanders who were in Ghaznī;\r\nSherīm T̤aghāī was one of them and the main strength of the tumult was\r\ngiven by the Mughūls. Many others were however involved in it, even such\r\nan old servant as Bābā of Pashāghar taking part (f. 234_b_; T.R. p.\r\n356). Ḥaidar did not know precisely the cause of the dispute, or shew\r\nwhy it should have turned against Bābur, since he attributes it to\r\npossession taken by Satan of the brains of the chiefs and a consequent\r\naccess of vain-glory and wickedness. Possibly some question of\r\nsuccession to Nāṣir arose. Dost Beg distinguished himself in the regular\r\nbattle which ensued; Qāsim Beg's son Qaṃbar-i-`alī hurried down from\r\nQūndūz and also did his good part to win it for Bābur. Many of the\r\nrioters were killed, others fled to Kāshghar. Sherīm T̤aghāī was one of\r\nthe latter; as Sa`īd Khān gave him no welcome, he could not stay there;\r\nhe fell back on the much injured Bābur who, says Ḥaidar, showed him his\r\nusual benevolence, turned his eyes from his offences and looked only at\r\nhis past services until he died shortly afterwards (T.R. p. 357).[1347]\r\n\r\n\r\n922 AH.—FEB. 5TH 1516 TO JAN. 24TH 1517 AD.\r\n\r\nThis year may have been spent in and near Kābul in the quiet promoted by\r\nthe dispersion of the Mughūls.\r\n\r\nIn this year was born Bābur's son Muḥammad known as _`Askarī_from his\r\nbeing born in camp. He was the son of Gulrukh _Begchīk_ and full-brother\r\nof Kāmrān.\r\n\r\n\r\n923 AH.—JAN. 24TH 1517 TO JAN. 13TH 1518 AD.\r\n\r\n_a. Bābur visits Balkh._\r\n\r\nKhwānd-amīr is the authority for the little that is known of Bābur's\r\naction in this year (Ḥ.S. iii, 367 _et seq._). It is connected with the\r\ndoings of Badī`u'z-zamān _Bāī-qarā's_ son Muḥammad-i-zamān. This Mīrzā\r\nhad had great wanderings, during a part of which Khwānd-amīr was with\r\nhim. In 920 AH. he was in Shāh Ismā`īl's service and in Balkh, but was\r\nnot able to keep it. Bābur invited him to Kābul,—the date of invitation\r\nwill have been later therefore than Bābur's return there at the end of\r\n920 AH. The Mīrzā was on his way but was dissuaded from going into Kābul\r\nby Mahdī Khwāja and went instead into Ghurjistān. Bābur was angered by\r\nhis non-arrival and pursued him in order to punish him but did not\r\nsucceed in reaching Ghurjistān and went back to Kābul by way of\r\nFīrūz-koh and Ghūr. The Mīrzā was captured eventually and sent to Kābul.\r\nBābur treated him with kindness, after a few months gave him his\r\ndaughter Ma`ṣūma in marriage, and sent him to Balkh. He appears to have\r\nbeen still in Balkh when Khwānd-amīr was writing of the above\r\noccurrences in 929 AH. The marriage took place either at the end of 923\r\nor beginning of 924 AH. The Mīrzā was then 21, Ma`ṣūma 9; she almost\r\ncertainly did not then go to Balkh. At some time in 923 AH. Bābur is\r\nsaid by Khwānd-amīr to have visited that town.[1348]\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Attempt on Qandahār._\r\n\r\nIn this year Bābur marched for Qandahār but the move ended peacefully,\r\nbecause a way was opened for gifts and terms by an illness which befell\r\nhim when he was near the town.\r\n\r\nThe _Tārīkh-i-sind_ gives what purports to be Shāh Beg's explanation of\r\nBābur's repeated attempts on Qandahār. He said these had been made and\r\nwould be made because Bābur had not forgiven Muqīm for taking Kābul 14\r\nyears earlier from the Tīmūrid `Abdu'r-razzāq; that this had brought him\r\nto Qandahār in 913 AH., this had made him then take away Māhchuchak,\r\nMuqīm's daughter; that there were now (923 AH.) many unemployed Mīrzās\r\nin Kābul for whom posts could not be found in regions where the Persians\r\nand Aūzbegs were dominant; that an outlet for their ambitions and for\r\nBābur's own would be sought against the weaker opponent he himself was.\r\n\r\nBābur's decision to attack in this year is said to have been taken while\r\nShāh Beg was still a prisoner of Shāh Ismā`īl in the Harāt country; he\r\nmust have been released meantime by the admirable patience of his slave\r\nSaṃbhal.\r\n\r\n\r\n924 AH.—JAN. 13TH 1518 TO JAN. 3RD 1519 AD.\r\n\r\nIn this year Shāh Beg's son Shāh Ḥasan came to Bābur after quarrel with\r\nhis father. He stayed some two years, and during that time was married\r\nto Khalīfa's daughter Gul-barg (Rose-leaf). His return to Qandahār will\r\nhave taken place shortly before Bābur's campaign of 926 A.H. against it,\r\na renewed effort which resulted in possession on Shawwāl 13th 928 AH.\r\n(Sep. 6th 1522 AD.).[1349]\r\n\r\nIn this year began the campaign in the north-east territories of Kābul,\r\nan account of which is carried on in the diary of 925 AH. It would seem\r\nthat in the present year Chaghān-sarāī was captured, and also the\r\nfortress at the head of the valley of Bābā-qarā, belonging to\r\nḤaidar-i-`alī _Bajaurī_ (f. 216_b_).[1350]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from above Babur's Grave and Shah-jahan's\r\nMosque.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n925 AH.-JAN. 3RD TO DEC. 23RD 1519 AD.[1351]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Bābur takes the fort of Bajaur._)\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 3rd_) On Monday[1352] the first day of the month of Muḥarram,\r\nthere was a violent earthquake in the lower part of the dale (_julga_)\r\nof Chandāwal,[1353] which lasted nearly half an astronomical hour.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 4th_) Marching at dawn from that camp with the intention of\r\nattacking the fort of Bajaur,[1354] we dismounted near it and sent a\r\ntrusty man of the Dilazāk[1355] Afghāns to advise its sulṯān[1356] and\r\npeople to take up a position of service (_qullūq_) and surrender the\r\nfort. Not accepting this counsel, that stupid and ill-fated band sent\r\nback a wild answer, where-upon the army was ordered to make ready\r\nmantelets, ladders and other appliances for taking a fort. For this\r\npurpose a day's (_Jan. 5th_) halt was made on that same ground.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 6th_) On Thursday the 4th of Muḥarram, orders were given that the\r\narmy should put on mail, arm and get to horse;[1357] that the left wing\r\nshould move swiftly to the upper side of the fort, cross the water at\r\nthe water-entry,[1358] and dismount on the [Sidenote: Fol. 217.] north\r\nside of the fort; that the centre, not taking the way across the water,\r\nshould dismount in the rough, up-and-down land to the north-west of the\r\nfort; and that the right should dismount to the west of the lower gate.\r\nWhile the begs of the left under Dost Beg were dismounting, after\r\ncrossing the water, a hundred to a hundred and fifty men on foot came\r\nout of the fort, shooting arrows. The begs, shooting in their turn,\r\nadvanced till they had forced those men back to the foot of the\r\nramparts, Mullā `Abdu'l-malūk of Khwāst, like a madman,[1359] going up\r\nright under them on his horse. There and then the fort would have been\r\ntaken if the ladders and mantelets had been ready, and if it had not\r\nbeen so late in the day. Mullā Tirik-i-`alī[1360] and a servant of\r\nTīngrī-bīrdī crossed swords with the enemy; each overcame his man, cut\r\noff and brought in his head; for this each was promised a reward.\r\n\r\nAs the Bajaurīs had never before seen matchlocks (_tufang_) they at\r\nfirst took no care about them, indeed they made fun when they heard the\r\nreport and answered it by unseemly gestures. On that day[1361] Ustād\r\n`Alī-qulī shot at and brought down five men with his matchlock; Walī the\r\nTreasurer, for his part, brought down two; other matchlockmen were also\r\nvery active in firing and did well, shooting through shield, through\r\ncuirass, through _kusarū_,[1362] and bringing down one man after\r\nanother. Perhaps 7, 8, or 10 Bajaurīs had fallen to the matchlock-fire\r\n(_ẓarb_) before night. After that it so became that not a head could be\r\nput out because of the fire. The order [Sidenote: Fol. 217b.] was given,\r\n\"It is night; let the army retire, and at dawn, if the appliances are\r\nready, let them swarm up into the fort.\"\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 7th_) At the first dawn of light (_farẓ waqt_) on Friday the 5th\r\nof Muḥarram, orders were given that, when the battle-nagarets had\r\nsounded, the army should advance, each man from his place to his\r\nappointed post (_yīrlīk yīrdīn_) and should swarm up. The left and\r\ncentre advanced from their ground with mantelets in place all along\r\ntheir lines, fixed their ladders, and swarmed up them. The whole left\r\nhand of the centre, under Khalīfa, Shāh Ḥasan _Arghūn_ and Yūsuf's\r\nAḥmad, was ordered to reinforce the left wing. Dost Beg's men went\r\nforward to the foot of the north-eastern tower of the fort, and busied\r\nthemselves in undermining and bringing it down. Ustād `Alī-qulī was\r\nthere also; he shot very well on that day with his matchlock, and he\r\ntwice fired off the _firingī_.[1363] Walī the Treasurer also brought\r\ndown a man with his matchlock. Malik `Alī _quṯnī_[1364] was first up a\r\nladder of all the men from the left hand of the centre, and there was\r\nbusy with fight and blow. At the post of the centre, Muḥ. `Alī\r\n_Jang-jang_[1365] and his younger brother Nau-roz got up, each by a\r\ndifferent ladder, and made lance and sword to touch. Bābā the waiting\r\nman (_yasāwal_), getting up by another ladder, occupied himself in\r\nbreaking down the fort-wall with his [Sidenote: Fol. 218.] axe. Most of\r\nour braves went well forward, shooting off dense flights of arrows and\r\nnot letting the enemy put out a head; others made themselves desperately\r\nbusy in breaching and pulling down the fort, caring naught for the\r\nenemy's fight and blow, giving no eye to his arrows and stones. By\r\nbreakfast-time Dost Beg's men had undermined and breached the\r\nnorth-eastern tower, got in and put the foe to flight. The men of the\r\ncentre got in up the ladders by the same time, but those (_aūl_) others\r\nwere first (_awwal_?) in.[1366] By the favour and pleasure of the High\r\nGod, this strong and mighty fort was taken in two or three astronomical\r\nhours! Matching the fort were the utter struggle and effort of our\r\nbraves; distinguish themselves they did, and won the name and fame of\r\nheroes.\r\n\r\nAs the Bajaurīs were rebels and at enmity with the people of Islām, and\r\nas, by reason of the heathenish and hostile customs prevailing in their\r\nmidst, the very name of Islām was rooted out from their tribe, they were\r\nput to general massacre and their wives and children were made captive.\r\nAt a guess more than 3000 men went to their death; as the fight did not\r\nreach to the eastern side of the fort, a few got away there.\r\n\r\nThe fort taken, we entered and inspected it. On the walls, in houses,\r\nstreets and alleys, the dead lay, in what numbers! Comers and goers to\r\nand fro were passing over the bodies. [Sidenote: Fol. 218b.] Returning\r\nfrom our inspection, we sat down in the Bajaur sulṯān's residence. The\r\ncountry of Bajaur we bestowed on Khwāja Kalān,[1367] assigning a large\r\nnumber of braves to reinforce him. At the Evening Prayer we went back to\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Movements in Bajaur._)\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 8th_) Marching at dawn (Muḥ. 6th), we dismounted by the\r\nspring[1368] of Bābā Qarā in the dale of Bajaur. At Khwāja Kalān's\r\nrequest the prisoners remaining were pardoned their offences, reunited\r\nto their wives and children, and given leave to go, but several sulṯāns\r\nand of the most stubborn were made to reach their doom of death. Some\r\nheads of sulṯāns and of others were sent to Kābul with the news of\r\nsuccess; some also to Badakhshān, Qūndūz and Balkh with the\r\nletters-of-victory.\r\n\r\nShāh Manṣūr _Yūsuf-zāī_,—he was with us as an envoy from his\r\ntribe,—[1369] was an eye-witness of the victory and general massacre. We\r\nallowed him to leave after putting a coat (_tūn_) on him and after\r\nwriting orders with threats to the Yūsuf-zāī.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 11th_) With mind easy about the important affairs of the Bajaur\r\nfort, we marched, on Tuesday the 9th of Muḥarram, one _kuroh_ (2 m.)\r\ndown the dale of Bajaur and ordered that a tower of heads should be set\r\nup on the rising-ground.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 12th_) On Wednesday the 10th of Muḥarram, we rode out to visit\r\nthe Bajaur fort. There was a wine-party in Khwāja Kalān's house,[1370]\r\nseveral goat-skins of wine having been brought down by Kāfirs\r\nneighbouring on Bajaur. All wine and fruit [Sidenote: Fol. 219.] had in\r\nBajaur comes from adjacent parts of Kāfiristān.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 13th_) We spent the night there and after inspecting the towers\r\nand ramparts of the fort early in the morning (Muḥ. 11th), I mounted and\r\nwent back to camp.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 14th_) Marching at dawn (Muḥ. 12th), we dismounted on the bank of\r\nthe Khwāja Khiẓr torrent.[1371]\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 15th_) Marching thence, we dismounted (Muḥ. 13th) on the bank of\r\nthe Chandāwal torrent. Here all those inscribed in the Bajaur\r\nreinforcement, were ordered to leave.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 16th_) On Sunday the 14th of Muḥarram, a standard was bestowed on\r\nKhwāja Kalān and leave given him for Bajaur. A few days after I had let\r\nhim go, the following little verse having come into my head, it was\r\nwritten down and sent to him:—[1372]\r\n\r\n   Not such the pact and bargain betwixt my friend and me,\r\n     At length the tooth of parting, unpacted grief for me!\r\n   Against caprice of Fortune, what weapons (_chāra_) arm the man?\r\n     At length by force of arms (_ba jaur_) my friend is snatched from me!\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 19th_) On Wednesday the 17th of Muḥarram, Sl. `Alā'u'd-dīn of\r\nSawād, the rival (_mu`āriẓ_) of Sl. Wais of Sawād,[1373] came and waited\r\non me.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 20th_) On Thursday the 18th of the month, we hunted the hill\r\nbetween Bajaur and Chandāwal.[1374] There the _būghū-marāl_[1375] have\r\nbecome quite black, except for the tail which is of another colour;\r\nlower down, in Hindūstān, they seem to become black all over.[1376]\r\nToday a _sārīq-qūsh_[1377] was taken; that was black all over, its very\r\neyes being black! Today an eagle (_būrkūt_)[1378] took a deer (_kīyīk_).\r\n\r\nCorn being somewhat scarce in the army, we went into the Kahrāj-valley,\r\nand took some. [Sidenote: Fol. 219b.]\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 21st_) On Friday (Muḥ. 19th) we marched for Sawād, with the\r\nintention of attacking the Yūsuf-zāī Afghāns, and dismounted in\r\nbetween[1379] the water of Panj-kūra and the united waters of Chandāwal\r\nand Bajaur. Shāh Manṣūr _Yūsuf-zāī_ had brought a few well-flavoured and\r\nquite intoxicating confections (_kamālī_); making one of them into\r\nthree, I ate one portion, Gadāī T̤aghāī another, `Abdu'l-lāh the\r\nlibrarian another. It produced remarkable intoxication; so much so that\r\nat the Evening Prayer when the begs gathered for counsel, I was not able\r\nto go out. A strange thing it was! If in these days[1380] I ate the\r\nwhole of such a confection, I doubt if it would produce half as much\r\nintoxication.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. An impost laid on Kahrāj._)\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 22nd_) Marching from that ground, (Muḥ. 20th), we dismounted over\r\nagainst Kahrāj, at the mouth of the valleys of Kahrāj and\r\nPeshgrām.[1381] Snow fell ankle-deep while we were on that ground; it\r\nwould seem to be rare for snow to fall thereabouts, for people were much\r\nsurprised. In agreement with Sl. Wais of Sawād there was laid on the\r\nKahrāj people an impost of 4000 ass-loads of rice for the use of the\r\narmy, and he himself was sent to collect it. Never before had those rude\r\nmountaineers borne such a burden; they could not give (all) the grain\r\nand were brought to ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_cc. Raid on Panj-kūra._)\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 25th_) On Tuesday the 23rd of Muḥarram an army was [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 220.] sent under Hindū Beg to raid Panj-kūra. Panj-kūra lies more\r\nthan half-way up the mountain;[1382] to reach its villages a person must\r\ngo for nearly a _kuroh_ (2 m.) through a pass. The people had fled and\r\ngot away; our men brought a few beasts of sorts, and masses of corn from\r\ntheir houses.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 26th_) Next day (Muḥ. 24th) Qūj Beg was put at the head of a\r\nforce and sent out to raid.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 27th_) On Thursday the 25th of the month, we dismounted at the\r\nvillage of Māndīsh, in the trough of the Kahrāj-valley, for the purpose\r\nof getting corn for the army.\r\n\r\n(_d. Māhīm's adoption of Dil-dār's unborn child._)\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 28th_) Several children born of Humāyūn's mother had not lived.\r\nHind-āl was not yet born.[1383] While we were in those parts, came a\r\nletter from Māhīm in which she wrote, \"Whether it be a boy, whether it\r\nbe a girl, is my luck and chance; give it to me; I will declare it my\r\nchild and will take charge of it.\" On Friday the 26th of the month, we\r\nbeing still on that ground, Yūsuf-i-`alī the stirrup-holder was sent off\r\nto Kābul with letters[1384] bestowing Hind-āl, not yet born, on Māhīm.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_dd. Construction of a stone platform._)\r\n\r\nWhile we were still on that same ground in the Māndīsh-country, I had a\r\nplatform made with stones (_tāsh bīla_) on a height in the middle of the\r\nvalley, so large that it held the tents of the advance-camp. All the\r\nhousehold and soldiers carried the stones for it, one by one like ants.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Bābur's marriage with his Afghān wife, Bībī Mubāraka._)\r\n\r\nIn order to conciliate the Yūsuf-zāī horde, I had asked for a daughter\r\nof one of my well-wishers, Malik Sulaimān Shāh's son Malik Shāh Manṣūr,\r\nat the time he came to me as envoy [Sidenote: Fol. 220b.] from the\r\nYūsuf-zāī Afghāns.[1385]\r\n\r\nWhile we were on this ground news came that his daughter[1386] was on\r\nher way with the Yūsuf-zāī tribute. At the Evening Prayer there was a\r\nwine-party to which Sl. `Alā'u'd-dīn (of Sawād) was invited and at which\r\nhe was given a seat and special dress of honour (_khilcat-i-khāṣa_).\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 30th_) On Sunday the 28th, we marched from that valley. Shāh\r\nManṣūr's younger brother T̤āūs (Handsome) Khān brought the\r\nabove-mentioned daughter of his brother to our ground after we had\r\ndismounted.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Repopulation of the fort of Bajaur._)\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of having the Bī-sūt people in Bajaur-fort,[1387]\r\nYūsuf'i-`alī the taster was sent from this camp to get them on the march\r\nand take them to that fort. Also, written orders were despatched to\r\nKābul that the army there left should join us.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 4th_) On Friday the 3rd of the month of Ṣafar, we dismounted at\r\nthe confluence of the waters of Bajaur and Panj-kūra.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 6th_) On Sunday the 5th of the month, we went from that ground to\r\nBajaur where there was a drinking-party in Khwāja Kalān's house.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Expedition against the Afghān clans._)\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 8th_) On Tuesday the 7th of the month the begs and the Dilazāk\r\nAfghān headmen were summoned, and, after consultation, matters were left\r\nat this:—\"The year is at its end,[1388] only a few days of the Fish are\r\nleft; the plainsmen have carried in all their corn; if we went now into\r\nSawād, the army would [Sidenote: Fol. 221.] dwindle through getting no\r\ncorn. The thing to do is to march along the Aṃbahar and Pānī-mānī road,\r\ncross the Sawād-water above Hash-nagar, and surprise the Yūsuf-zāī and\r\nMuḥammadī Afghāns who are located in the plain over against the\r\nYūsuf-zāī _sangur_ of Māhūrā. Another year, coming earlier in the\r\nharvest-time, the Afghāns of this place must be our first thought.\" So\r\nthe matter was left.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 9th_) Next day, Wednesday, we bestowed horses and robes on Sl.\r\nWais and Sl. `Alā'u'u-dīn of Sawād, gave them leave to go, marched off\r\nourselves and dismounted over against Bajaur.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 10th_) We marched next day, leaving Shāh Manṣūr's daughter in\r\nBajaur-fort until the return of the army. We dismounted after passing\r\nKhwāja Khiẓr, and from that camp leave was given to Khwāja Kalān; and\r\nthe heavy baggage, the worn-out horses and superfluous effects of the\r\narmy were started off into Lamghān by the Kūnār road.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 11th_) Next morning Khwāja Mīr-i-mīrān was put in charge of the\r\ncamel baggage-train and started off by the Qūrghā-tū and Darwāza road,\r\nthrough the Qarā-kūpa-pass. Riding light for the raid, we ourselves\r\ncrossed the Ambahar-pass, and yet another great pass, and dismounted at\r\nPānī-mālī nearer[1389] the Afternoon Prayer. Aūghān-bīrdī was sent\r\nforward with a few others to learn[1390] how things were.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 12th_) The distance between us and the Afghāns being\r\nshort, we did not make an early start. Aūghān-bīrdī came back at\r\nbreakfast-time.[1391] He had got the better of an Afghān and had cut\r\nhis head off, but had dropped it on the road. He [Sidenote: Fol. 221b.]\r\nbrought no news so sure as the heart asks (_kūnkūl-tīladīk_). Midday\r\ncome, we marched on, crossed the Sawād-water, and dismounted\r\nnearer[1392] the Afternoon Prayer. At the Bed-time Prayer, we remounted\r\nand rode swiftly on.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 13th_) Rustam _Turkmān_ had been sent scouting; when the Sun was\r\nspear-high he brought word that the Afghāns had heard about us and were\r\nshifting about, one body of them making off by the mountain-road. On\r\nthis we moved the faster, sending raiders on ahead who killed a few, cut\r\noff their heads and brought a band of prisoners, some cattle and flocks.\r\nThe Dilazāk Afghāns also cut off and brought in a few heads. Turning\r\nback, we dismounted near Kātlāng and from there sent a guide to meet the\r\nbaggage-train under Khwāja Mīr-i-mīrān and bring it to join us in\r\nMaqām.[1393]\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 14th_) Marching on next day, we dismounted between Kātlāng and\r\nMaqām. A man of Shāh Manṣūr's arrived. Khusrau Kūkūldāsh and Aḥmadī the\r\nsecretary were sent with a few more to meet the baggage-train.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 15th_) On Wednesday the 14th of the month, the baggage-train\r\nrejoined us while we were dismounting at Maqām.\r\n\r\nIt will have been within the previous 30 or 40 years that a heretic\r\nqalandar named Shahbāz perverted a body of Yūsuf-zāī and another of\r\nDilazāk. His tomb was on a free and dominating height of the lower hill\r\nat the bill (_tūmshūq_) of the [Sidenote: Fol. 222.] Maqām mountain.\r\nThought I, \"What is there to recommend the tomb of a heretic qalandar\r\nfor a place in air so free?\" and ordered the tomb destroyed and levelled\r\nwith the ground. The place was so charming and open that we elected to\r\nsit there some time and to eat a confection (_ma'jūn_).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Bābur crosses the Indus for the first time._)\r\n\r\nWe had turned off from Bajaur with Bhīra in our thoughts.[1394] Ever\r\nsince we came into Kābul it had been in my mind to move on Hindūstān,\r\nbut this had not been done for a variety of reasons. Nothing to count\r\nhad fallen into the soldiers' hands during the three or four months we\r\nhad been leading this army. Now that Bhīra, the borderland of Hindūstān,\r\nwas so near, I thought a something might fall into our men's hands if,\r\nriding light, we went suddenly into it. To this thought I clung, but\r\nsome of my well-wishers, after we had raided the Afghāns and dismounted\r\nat Maqām, set the matter in this way before me:—\"If we are to go into\r\nHindūstān, it should be on a proper basis; one part of the army stayed\r\nbehind in Kābul; a body of effective braves was left behind in Bajaur; a\r\ngood part of this army has gone into Lamghān because its horses were\r\nworn-out; and the horses of those who have come this far, are so poor\r\nthat they have not a day's hard riding in them.\" Reasonable as these\r\nconsiderations were, yet, having made the start, we paid no [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 222b.] attention to them but set off next day for the ford through\r\nthe water of Sind.[1395] Mīr Muḥammad the raftsman and his elder and\r\nyounger brethren were sent with a few braves to examine the Sind-river\r\n(_daryā_), above and below the ford.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 16th_) After starting off the camp for the river, I went to hunt\r\nrhinoceros on the Sawātī side which place people call also Karg-khāna\r\n(Rhino-home).[1396] A few were discovered but the jungle was dense and\r\nthey did not come out of it. When one with a calf came into the open and\r\nbetook itself to flight, many arrows were shot at it and it rushed into\r\nthe near jungle; the jungle was fired but that same rhino was not had.\r\nAnother calf was killed as it lay, scorched by the fire, writhing and\r\npalpitating. Each person took a share of the spoil. After leaving\r\nSawātī, we wandered about a good deal; it was the Bed-time Prayer when\r\nwe got to camp.\r\n\r\nThose sent to examine the ford came back after doing it.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 17th_) Next day, Thursday the 16th,[1397] the horses and\r\nbaggage-camels crossed through the ford and the camp-bazar and\r\nfoot-soldiers were put over on rafts. Some Nīl-ābīs came and saw me at\r\nthe ford-head (_guẕar-bāshī_), bringing a horse in mail and 300\r\n_shāhrukhīs_ as an offering. At the Mid-day Prayer of this same day,\r\nwhen every-one had crossed the river, we marched on; we went on until\r\none watch of the night had passed (_circa_ 9 p.m.) when we dismounted\r\nnear the water of Kacha-kot.[1398]\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 18th_) Marching on next day, we crossed the Kacha-kot-water; noon\r\nreturning, went through the Sangdakī-pass and dismounted. While Sayyid\r\nQāsim Lord of the Gate was [Sidenote: Fol. 223.] in charge of the rear\r\n(_chāghdāwal_) he overcame a few Gujūrs who had got up with the rear\r\nmarch, cut off and brought in 4 or 5 of their heads.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 19th_) Marching thence at dawn and crossing the Sūhān-water, we\r\ndismounted at the Mid-day Prayer. Those behind kept coming in till\r\nmidnight; the march had been mightily long, and, as many horses were\r\nweak and out-of-condition, a great number were left on the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. The Salt-range._)\r\n\r\nFourteen miles (_7 kos_) north of Bhīra lies the mountain-range written\r\nof in the _Z̤afar-nāma_ and other books as the Koh-i-jūd.[1399] I had\r\nnot known why it was called this; I now knew. On it dwell two tribes,\r\ndescendants from one parent-source, one is called Jūd, the other\r\nJanjūha. These two from of old have been the rulers and lawful\r\ncommanders of the peoples and hordes (_aūlūs_) of the range and of the\r\ncountry between Bhīra and Nīl-āb. Their rule is friendly and brotherly\r\nhowever; they cannot take what their hearts might desire; the portion\r\nancient custom has fixed is given and taken, no less and no more. The\r\nagreement is to give one _shāhrukhī_[1400] for each yoke of oxen and\r\nseven for headship in a household; there is also service in the army.\r\nThe Jūd and Janjūha both are divided into several clans. The Koh-i-jūd\r\nruns for 14 miles along the Bhīra country, taking off from those Kashmīr\r\nmountains that are one with [Sidenote: Fol. 223b.] Hindū-kūsh, and it\r\ndraws out to the south-west as far as the foot of Dīn-kot on the\r\nSind-river.[1401] On one half of it are the Jūd, the Janjūha on the\r\nother. People call it Koh-i-jūd through connecting it with the Jūd\r\ntribe.[1402] The principal headman gets the title of Rāī; others, his\r\nyounger brothers and sons, are styled Malik. The Janjūha headmen are\r\nmaternal uncles of Langar Khan. The ruler of the people and horde near\r\nthe Sūhān-water was named Malik Hast. The name originally was Asad but\r\nas Hindūstānīs sometimes drop a vowel _e.g._ they say _khabr_ for\r\n_khabar_ (news), they had said Asd for Asad, and this went on to Hast.\r\n\r\nLangar Khān was sent off to Malik Hast at once when we dismounted. He\r\ngalloped off, made Malik Hast hopeful of our favour and kindness, and at\r\nthe Bed-time Prayer, returned with him. Malik Hast brought an offering\r\nof a horse in mail and waited on me. He may have been 22 or 23 years\r\nold.[1403]\r\n\r\nThe various flocks and herds belonging to the country-people were close\r\nround our camp. As it was always in my heart to possess Hindūstān, and\r\nas these several countries, Bhīra, Khūsh-āb, Chīn-āb and Chīnīūt[1404]\r\nhad once been held by the Turk, I pictured them as my own and was\r\nresolved to get them into my hands, whether peacefully or by force. For\r\nthese reasons it being imperative to treat these hillmen well, this\r\nfollowing [Sidenote: Fol. 224.] order was given:—\"Do no hurt or harm to\r\nthe flocks and herds of these people, nor even to their cotton-ends and\r\nbroken needles!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. The Kalda-kahār lake_.)\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 20th_) Marching thence next day, we dismounted at the Mid-day\r\nPrayer amongst fields of densely-growing corn in Kalda-kahār.\r\n\r\nKalda-kahār is some 20 miles north of Bhīra, a level land shut in[1405]\r\namongst the Jūd mountains. In the middle of it is a lake some six miles\r\nround, the in-gatherings of rain from all sides. On the north of this\r\nlake lies an excellent meadow; on the hill-skirt to the west of it there\r\nis a spring[1406] having its source in the heights overlooking the lake.\r\nThe place being suitable I have made a garden there, called the\r\nBāgh-i-ṣafā,[1407] as will be told later; it is a very charming place\r\nwith good air.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 21st_) We rode from Kalda-kahār at dawn next day. When we reached\r\nthe top of the Hamtātū-pass a few local people waited on me, bringing a\r\nhumble gift. They were joined with `Abdu'r-raḥīm the chief-scribe\r\n(_shaghāwal_) and sent with him to speak the Bhīra people fair and say,\r\n\"The possession of this country by a Turk has come down from of old;\r\nbeware not to bring ruin on its people by giving way to fear and\r\nanxiety; our eye is on this land and on this people; raid and rapine\r\nshall not be.\"\r\n\r\nWe dismounted near the foot of the pass at breakfast-time, [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 224b.] and thence sent seven or eight men ahead, under Qurbān of\r\nChīrkh and `Abdu'l-malūk of Khwāst. Of those sent one Mīr Muḥammad (a\r\nservant ?) of Mahdī Khwāja[1408] brought in a man. A few Afghān headmen,\r\nwho had come meantime with offerings and done obeisance, were joined\r\nwith Langar Khān to go and speak the Bhīra people fair.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the pass and getting out of the jungle, we arrayed in\r\nright and left and centre, and moved forward for Bhīra. As we got near\r\nit there came in, of the servants of Daulat Khān _Yūsuf-khail's_ son\r\n`Alī Khān, Sīktū's son Dīwa _Hindū_; with them came several of the\r\nnotables of Bhīra who brought a horse and camel as an offering and did\r\nme obeisance. At the Mid-day Prayer we dismounted on the east of Bhīra,\r\non the bank of the Bahat (Jehlam), in a sown-field, without hurt or harm\r\nbeing allowed to touch the people of Bhīra.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. History of Bhīra._)\r\n\r\nTīmūr Beg had gone into Hindūstān; from the time he went out again these\r\nseveral countries _viz._ Bhīra, Khūsh-āb, Chīn-āb and Chīnīūt, had been\r\nheld by his descendants and the dependants and adherents of those\r\ndescendants. After the death of Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā and his son `Alī\r\n_Asghar_ Mīrzā, the sons of Mīr `Alī Beg [Sidenote: Fol. 225.] _viz._\r\nBābā-i-kābulī, Daryā Khān and Apāq Khān, known later as Ghāzī Khān, all\r\nof whom Sl. Mas`ūd M. had cherished, through their dominant position,\r\ngot possession of Kābul, Zābul and the afore-named countries and\r\n_parganas_ of Hindūstān. In Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā's time, Kābul and Zābul\r\nwent from their hands, the Hindūstān countries remaining. In 910 AH.\r\n(1504 AD.) the year I first came into Kābul, the government of Bhīra,\r\nKhūsh-āb and Chīn-āb depended on Sayyid `Alī Khān, son of Ghāzī Khān and\r\ngrandson of Mīr `Alī Beg, who read the _khuṯba_ for Sikandar son of\r\nBuhlūl (_Lūdī Afghān_) and was subject to him. When I led that army out\r\n(910 AH.) Sayyid `Alī Khān left Bhīra in terror, crossed the\r\nBahat-water, and seated himself in Sher-kot, one of the villages of\r\nBhīra. A few years later the Afghāns became suspicious about him on my\r\naccount; he, giving way to his own fears and anxieties, made these\r\ncountries over to the then governor [Sidenote: Fol. 225b.] in Lāhūr,\r\nDaulat Khān, son of Tātār Khān _Yūsuf-khail_, who gave them to his own\r\neldest son `Alī Khān, and in `Alī Khān's possession they now were.\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on Sl. Mas`ūd Mīrzā._) He was the son of\r\n   Sūyūrghatmīsh Mīrzā, son of Shāhrukh Mīrzā, (son of Tīmūr),\r\n   and was known as Sl. Mas`ūd _Kābulī_ because the government\r\n   and administration of Kābul and Zābul were then dependent on\r\n   him (deposed 843 AH.-1440 AD.)\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note to 910 AH._) That year, with the wish to enter\r\n   Hindūstān, Khaibar had been crossed and Parashāwūr (_sic_) had\r\n   been reached, when Bāqī _Chaghānīānī_ insisted on a move\r\n   against Lower Bangash _i.e._ Kohāt, a mass of Afghāns were\r\n   raided and scraped clean (_qīrīb_), the Bannū plain was raided\r\n   and plundered, and return was made through Dūkī (Dūgī).\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on Daulat Khān Yūsuf-khail._) This Tātār Khān,\r\n   the father of Daulat Khān, was one of six or seven _sardārs_\r\n   who, sallying out and becoming dominant in Hindūstān, made\r\n   Buhlūl Pādshāh. He held the country north of the Satluj\r\n   (_sic_) and Sahrind,[1409] the revenues of which exceeded 3\r\n   _krūrs_.[1410] On Tātār Khān's death, Sl. Sikandar (_Lūdī_),\r\n   as over-lord, took those countries from Tātār Khān's sons and\r\n   gave Lāhūr only to Daulat Khān. That happened a year or two\r\n   before I came into the country of Kābul (910 AH.).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Bābur's journey resumed._)\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 22nd_) Next morning foragers were sent to several convenient\r\nplaces; on the same day I visited Bhīra; and on the same day Sangur Khān\r\n_Janjūha_ came, made offering of a horse, and did me obeisance.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 23rd_) On Wednesday the 22nd of the month, the headmen and\r\n_chauderis_[1411] of Bhīra were summoned, a sum of 400,000\r\n_shāhrukhīs_[1412] was agreed on as the price of peace _(māl-i-amān)_,\r\nand collectors were appointed. We also made an excursion, going in a\r\nboat and there eating a confection.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 24th_) Ḥaidar the standard-bearer had been sent to the Bilūchīs\r\nlocated in Bhīra and Khūsh-āb; on Thursday morning they made an offering\r\nof an almond-coloured _tīpūchāq_ [horse], and did obeisance. As it was\r\nrepresented to me that some of the soldiery were behaving without sense\r\nand were laying-hands on Bhīra people, persons were sent who caused some\r\nof those [Sidenote: Fol. 226.] senseless people to meet their\r\ndeath-doom, of others slit the noses and so led them round the camp.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 25th_) On Friday came a dutiful letter from the Khūshābīs; on\r\nthis Shāh Shujā` _Arghūn's_ son Shāh Ḥasan was appointed to go to\r\nKhūsh-āb.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 26th_) On Saturday the 25th of the month,[1413] Shāh Ḥasan was\r\nstarted for Khūsh-āb.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 27th_) On Sunday so much rain fell[1414] that water covered all\r\nthe plain. A small brackish stream[1415] flowing between Bhīra and the\r\ngardens in which the army lay, had become like a great river before the\r\nMid-day Prayer; while at the ford near Bhīra there was no footing for\r\nmore than an arrow's flight; people crossing had to swim. In the\r\nafternoon I rode out to watch the water coming down (_kīrkān sū_); the\r\nrain and storm were such that on the way back there was some fear about\r\ngetting in to camp. I crossed that same water (_kīrkān sū_) with my\r\nhorse swimming. The army-people were much alarmed; most of them\r\nabandoned tents and heavy baggage, shouldered armour, horse-mail and\r\narms, made their horses swim and crossed bare-back. Most streams flooded\r\nthe plain.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 28th_) Next day boats were brought from the river (Jehlam), and\r\nin these most of the army brought their tents and baggage over. Towards\r\nmid-day, Qūj Beg's men went 2 miles up the water and there found a ford\r\nby which the rest crossed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 226b.] (_March 1st_) After a night spent in Bhīra-fort,\r\nJahān-nūma they call it, we marched early on the Tuesday morning out of\r\nthe worry of the rain-flood to the higher ground north of Bhīra.\r\n\r\nAs there was some delay about the moneys asked for and agreed to\r\n(_taqabbul_), the country was divided into four districts and the begs\r\nwere ordered to try to make an end of the matter. Khalīfa was appointed\r\nto one district, Qūj Beg to another, Nāṣir's Dost to another, Sayyid\r\nQāsim and Muḥibb-i-`alī to another. Picturing as our own the countries\r\nonce occupied by the Turk, there was to be no over-running or\r\nplundering.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Envoys sent to the court in Dihlī._)\r\n\r\n(_March 3rd_) People were always saying, \"It could do no harm to send an\r\nenvoy, for peace' sake, to countries that once depended on the Turk.\"\r\nAccordingly on Thursday the 1st of Rabī`u'l-awwal, Mullā Murshid was\r\nappointed to go to Sl. Ibrāhīm who through the death of his father Sl.\r\nIskandar had attained to rule in Hindūstān some 5 or 6 months\r\nearlier(?). I sent him a goshawk (_qārchīgha_) and asked for the\r\ncountries which from of old had depended on the Turk. Mullā Murshid was\r\ngiven charge of writings (_khāṯt̤lār_) for Daulat Khān (_Yūsuf-khail_)\r\nand writings for Sl. Ibrāhīm; matters were sent also by word-of-mouth;\r\nand he was given leave to go. Far from sense and wisdom, shut off from\r\njudgment and counsel must people in Hindūstān be, the Afghāns above all;\r\nfor they could not move and make stand like a foe, nor did they know\r\nways and rules of friendliness. [Sidenote: Fol. 227.] Daulat Khān kept\r\nmy man several days in Lāhūr without seeing him himself or speeding him\r\non to Sl. Ibrāhīm; and he came back to Kābul a few months later without\r\nbringing a reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. Birth of Hind-āl._)\r\n\r\n(_March 4th_) On Friday the 2nd of the month, the foot-soldiers Shaibak\r\nand Darwesh-i-`alī,—he is now a matchlockman,—bringing dutiful letters\r\nfrom Kābul, brought news also of Hind-āl's birth. As the news came\r\nduring the expedition into Hindūstān, I took it as an omen, and gave the\r\nname Hind-āl (Taking of Hind). Dutiful letters came also from\r\nMuḥammad-i-zamān M. in Balkh, by the hand of Qaṃbar Beg.\r\n\r\n(_March 5th_) Next morning when the Court rose, we rode out for an\r\nexcursion, entered a boat and there drank _`araq_.[1416] The people of\r\nthe party were Khwāja Dost-khāwand, Khusrau, Mīrīm, Mīrzā Qulī,\r\nMuḥammadī, Aḥmadī, Gadāī, Na`man, Langar Khān, Rauh-dam,[1417]\r\nQāsim-i-`alī the opium-eater (_tariyākī_), Yūsuf-i-`alī and Tīngrī-qulī.\r\nTowards the head of the boat there was a _tālār_[1418] on the flat top\r\nof which I sat with a few people, a few others sitting below. There was\r\na sitting-place also at the tail of the boat; there Muḥammadī, Gadāī and\r\nNa`man sat. _`Araq_ was drunk till the Other Prayer when, disgusted by\r\nits bad flavour, by consent of those at the head of the boat, _ma'jūn_\r\nwas preferred. [Sidenote: Fol. 227b.] Those at the other end, knowing\r\nnothing about our _ma'jūn_ drank _`araq_ right through. At the Bed-time\r\nPrayer we rode from the boat and got into camp late. Thinking I had been\r\ndrinking _`araq_ Muḥammadī and Gadāī had said to one another, \"Let's do\r\nbefitting service,\" lifted a pitcher of _`araq_ up to one another in\r\nturn on their horses, and came in saying with wonderful joviality and\r\nheartiness and speaking together, \"Through this dark night have we come\r\ncarrying this pitcher in turns!\" Later on when they knew that the party\r\nwas (now) meant to be otherwise and the hilarity to differ, that is to\r\nsay, that [there would be that] of the _ma'jūn_ band and that of the\r\ndrinkers, they were much disturbed because never does a _ma'jūn_ party\r\ngo well with a drinking-party. Said I, \"Don't upset the party! Let those\r\nwho wish to drink _`araq_, drink _`araq_; let those who wish to eat\r\n_ma'jūn_, eat _ma'jūn_. Let no-one on either side make talk or allusion\r\nto the other.\" Some drank _`araq_, some ate _ma'jūn_, and for a time the\r\nparty went on quite politely. Bābā Jān the _qabūz_-player had not been\r\nof our party (in the boat); we invited him when we reached the tents. He\r\nasked to drink _`araq_. We invited Tardī Muḥammad _Qībchāq_ also and\r\nmade him a comrade of the drinkers. A _ma'jūn_ party never goes well\r\nwith an _`araq_ or a wine-party; the drinkers began to make wild talk\r\nand chatter from all sides, mostly in allusion to _ma'jūn_ and\r\n_ma'jūnīs_. Bābā Jān even, when drunk, said many wild things. The\r\ndrinkers soon made Tardī Khān mad-drunk, by giving him one full bowl\r\nafter another. Try as we did [Sidenote: Fol. 228.] to keep things\r\nstraight, nothing went well; there was much disgusting uproar; the party\r\nbecame intolerable and was broken up.\r\n\r\n(_March 7th_) On Monday the 5th of the month, the country of Bhīra was\r\ngiven to Hindū Beg.\r\n\r\n(_March 8th_) On Tuesday the Chīn-āb country was bestowed on Ḥusain\r\n_Aīkrak_(?) and leave was given to him and the Chīn-āb people to set\r\nout. At this time Sayyid `Alī Khān's son Minūchihr Khān, having let us\r\nknow (his intention), came and waited on me. He had started from\r\nHindūstān by the upper road, had met in with Tātār Khān _Kakar_;[1419]\r\nTātār Khān had not let him pass on, but had kept him, made him a\r\nson-in-law by giving him his own daughter, and had detained him for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. The Kakars._)\r\n\r\nIn amongst the mountains of Nīl-āb and Bhīra which connect with those of\r\nKashmīr, there are, besides the Jūd and Janjūha tribes, many Jats,\r\nGujūrs, and others akin to them, seated in villages everywhere on every\r\nrising-ground. These are governed by headmen of the Kakar tribes, a\r\nheadship like that over the Jūd and Janjūha. At this time (925 AH.) the\r\nheadmen of the people of those hill-skirts were Tātār _Kakar_ and Hātī\r\n_Kakar_, two descendants of one forefather; being paternal-uncles'\r\nsons.[1420] Torrent-beds and ravines are their strongholds. Tātār's\r\nplace, named Parhāla,[1421] is a good deal below the snow-mountains;\r\nHātī's country connects with the mountains and also he had made Bābū\r\nKhān's fief Kālanjar,[1422] look towards himself. Tātār [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n228b.] _Kakar_ had seen Daulat Khān (_Yūsuf-khail_) and looked to him\r\nwith complete obedience. Hātī had not seen Daulat Khān; his attitude\r\ntowards him was bad and turbulent. At the word of the Hindūstān begs and\r\nin agreement with them, Tātār had so posted himself as to blockade Hātī\r\nfrom a distance. Just when we were in Bhīra, Hātī moved on pretext of\r\nhunting, fell unexpectedly on Tātār, killed him, and took his country,\r\nhis wives and his having (_būlghāni_).[1423]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. Bābur's journey resumed._)\r\n\r\nHaving ridden out at the Mid-day Prayer for an excursion, we got on a\r\nboat and _`araq_ was drunk. The people of the party were Dost Beg, Mīrzā\r\nQulī, Aḥmadī, Gadāī, Muḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang_, `Asas,[1424] and\r\nAūghān-bīrdī _Mughūl_. The musicians were Rauḥ-dam, Bābā Jān,\r\nQāsim-i-`alī, Yūsuf-i-`alī, Tīngrī-qulī, Abū'l-qāsim, Rāmẓān _Lūlī_. We\r\ndrank in the boat till the Bed-time Prayer; then getting off it, full of\r\ndrink, we mounted, took torches in our hands, and went to camp from the\r\nriver's bank, leaning over from our horses on this side, leaning over\r\nfrom that, at one loose-rein gallop! Very drunk I must have been for,\r\nwhen they told me next day that we had galloped loose-rein into camp,\r\ncarrying torches, I could not recall it in the very least. After\r\nreaching my quarters, I vomited a good deal.\r\n\r\n(_March 11th_) On Friday we rode out on an excursion, crossed the water\r\n(Jehlam) by boat and went about amongst the orchards (_bāghāt_) of\r\nblossoming trees and the lands of the sugar-cultivation. We saw the\r\nwheel with buckets, had water drawn, and asked [Sidenote: Fol. 229.]\r\nparticulars about getting it out; indeed we made them draw it again and\r\nagain. During this excursion a confection was preferred. In returning we\r\nwent on board a boat. A confection (_ma'jūn_) was given also to\r\nMinūchihr Khān, such a one that, to keep him standing, two people had to\r\ngive him their arms. For a time the boat remained at anchor in\r\nmid-stream; we then went down-stream; after a while had it drawn\r\nup-stream again, slept in it that night and went back to camp near dawn.\r\n\r\n(_March 12th_) On Saturday the 10th of the first Rabī`, the Sun entered\r\nthe Ram. Today we rode out before mid-day and got into a boat where\r\n_`araq_ was drunk. The people of the party were Khwāja Dost-khāwand,\r\nDost Beg, Mīrīm, Mīrzā Qulī, Muḥammadī, Aḥmadī, Yūnas-i-`alī, Muḥ. `Alī\r\n_Jang-jang_, Gadāī T̤aghāī, Mīr Khurd (and ?) `Asas. The musicians were\r\nRauḥdam, Bābā Jān, Qāsim, Yūsuf-i-`alī, Tīngrī-qulī and Ramẓān. We got\r\ninto a branch-water (_shakh-i-āb_), for some time went down-stream,\r\nlanded a good deal below Bhīra and on its opposite bank, and went late\r\ninto camp.\r\n\r\nThis same day Shāh Ḥasan returned from Khūsh-āb whither he had been sent\r\nas envoy to demand the countries which from of old had depended on the\r\nTurk; he had settled peaceably with them and had in his hands a part of\r\nthe money assessed on them.\r\n\r\nThe heats were near at hand. To reinforce Hindū Beg (in Bhīra) were\r\nappointed Shāh Muḥammad Keeper of the Seal and his younger brother Dost\r\nBeg Keeper of the Seal, together with several suitable braves; an\r\naccepted (_yārāsha_) stipend [Sidenote: Fol. 229b.] was fixed and\r\nsettled in accordance with each man's position. Khūsh-āb was bestowed,\r\nwith a standard, on Langar Khān, the prime cause and mover of this\r\nexpedition; we settled also that he was to help Hindū Beg. We appointed\r\nalso to help Hindū Beg, the Turk and local soldiery of Bhīra, increasing\r\nthe allowances and pay of both. Amongst them was the afore-named\r\nMinūchihr Khān whose name has been mentioned; there was also\r\nNaẕar-i-`alī _Turk_, one of Minūchihr Khān's relations; there were also\r\nSangar Khān _Janjūha_ and Malik Hast _Janjūha_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_pp. Return for Kābul._)\r\n\r\n(_March 13th_) Having settled the country in every way making for hope\r\nof peace, we marched for Kābul from Bhīra on Sunday the 11th of the\r\nfirst Rabī`. We dismounted in Kaldah-kahār. That day too it rained\r\namazingly; people with rain-cloaks[1425] were in the same case as those\r\nwho had none! The rear of the camp kept coming in till the Bed-time\r\nPrayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_q. Action taken against Hātī Kakar._)\r\n\r\n(_March 14th_) People acquainted with the honour and glory (_āb u tāb_)\r\nof this land and government, especially the Janjūhas, old foes of these\r\nKakars, represented, \"Hātī is the bad man round-about; he it is robs on\r\nthe roads; he it is brings men to ruin; he ought either to be driven out\r\nfrom these parts, or to be severely punished.\" Agreeing with this, we\r\nleft Khwāja Mīr-i-mīrān and Nāṣir's Mīrīm next day with the camp,\r\nparting from them at big breakfast,[1426] and moved on Hātī _Kakar_. As\r\nhas been said, he had killed Tātār a few days earlier, and having taken\r\npossession of Parhāla, was in it now. Dismounting at the Other\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 230.] Prayer, we gave the horses corn; at the Bed-time\r\nPrayer we rode on again, our guide being a Gujūr servant of Malik Hast,\r\nnamed Sar-u-pā. We rode the night through and dismounted at dawn, when\r\nBeg Muḥammad _Mughūl_ was sent back to the camp, and we remounted when\r\nit was growing light. At breakfast-time (9 a.m.) we put our mail on and\r\nmoved forward faster. The blackness of Parhāla shewed itself from 2\r\nmiles off; the gallop was then allowed (_chāpqūn qūīūldī_); the right\r\nwent east of Parhāla, Qūj Beg, who was also of the right, following as\r\nits reserve; the men of the left and centre went straight for the fort,\r\nDost Beg being their rear-reserve.\r\n\r\nParhāla stands amongst ravines. It has two roads; one, by which we came,\r\nleads to it from the south-east, goes along the top of ravines and on\r\neither hand has hollows worn out by the torrents. A mile from Parhāla\r\nthis road, in four or five places before it reaches the Gate, becomes a\r\none-man road with a ravine falling from its either side; there for more\r\nthan an arrow's flight men must ride in single file. The other road\r\ncomes from the north-west; it gets up to Parhāla by the trough of a\r\nvalley and it also is a one-man road. There is no other road on any\r\nside. Parhāla though without breast-work or battlement, has no\r\nassailable place, its sides shooting perpendicularly [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n230b.] down for 7, 8, 10 yards.\r\n\r\nWhen the van of our left, having passed the narrow place, went in a body\r\nto the Gate, Hātī, with whom were 30 to 40 men in armour, their horses\r\nin mail, and a mass of foot-soldiers, forced his assailants to retire.\r\nDost Beg led his reserve forward, made a strong attack, dismounted a\r\nnumber of Hātī's men, and beat him. All the country-round, Hātī was\r\ncelebrated for his daring, but try as he did, he could effect nothing;\r\nhe took to flight; he could not make a stand in those narrow places; he\r\ncould not make the fort fast when he got back into it. His assailants\r\nwent in just behind him and ran on through the ravine and narrows of the\r\nnorth-west side of the fort, but he rode light and made his flight good.\r\nHere again, Dost Beg did very well and recompense was added to\r\nrenown.[1427]\r\n\r\nMeantime I had gone into the fort and dismounted at Tātār _Kakar's_\r\ndwelling. Several men had joined in the attack for whom to stay with me\r\nhad been arranged; amongst them were Amīn-i-muḥammad Tarkhān _Argkūn_\r\nand Qarācha.[1428] For this fault they were sent to meet the camp,\r\nwithout _sar-u-pā_, into the wilds and open country with Sar-u-pā[1429]\r\nfor their guide, the Gujūr mentioned already.\r\n\r\n(_March 16th_) Next day we went out by the north-west ravine and\r\ndismounted in a sown field. A few serviceable braves under Wālī the\r\ntreasurer were sent out to meet the camp.[1430]\r\n\r\n(_March 17th_) Marching on Thursday the 15th, we dismounted at Andarāba\r\non the Sūhān, a fort said to have depended from [Sidenote: Fol. 231.] of\r\nold on ancestors of Malik Hast. Hātī _Kakar_ had killed Malik Hast's\r\nfather and destroyed the fort; there it now lay in ruins.\r\n\r\nAt the Bed-time Prayer of this same day, those left at Kalda-kahār with\r\nthe camp rejoined us.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_r. Submissions to Bābur._)\r\n\r\nIt must have been after Hātī overcame Tātār that he started his kinsman\r\nParbat to me with tribute and an accoutred horse. Parbat did not light\r\nupon us but, meeting in with the camp we had left behind, came on in the\r\ncompany of the train. With it came also Langar Khān up from Bhīra on\r\nmatters of business. His affairs were put right and he, together with\r\nseveral local people, was allowed to leave.\r\n\r\n(_March 18th_) Marching on and crossing the Sūhān-water, we dismounted\r\non the rising-ground. Here Hātī's kinsman (Parbat) was robed in an\r\nhonorary dress (_khil`at_), given letters of encouragement for Hātī, and\r\ndespatched with a servant of Muḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang_. Nīl-āb and the\r\nQārlūq (Himalayan?) Hazāra had been given to Humāyūn (_aet._ 12); some\r\nof his servants under Bābā Dost and Halāhil came now for their\r\ndarogha-ship.[1431]\r\n\r\n(_March 19th_) Marching early next morning, we dismounted after riding 2\r\nmiles, went to view the camp from a height and ordered that the\r\ncamp-camels should be counted; it came out at 570. [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n231b.]\r\n\r\nWe had heard of the qualities of the saṃbhal plant[1432]; we saw it on\r\nthis ground; along this hill-skirt it grows sparsely, a plant here, a\r\nplant there; it grows abundantly and to a large size further along the\r\nskirt-hills of Hindūstān. It will be described when an account is given\r\nof the animals and plants of Hindūstān.[1433]\r\n\r\n(_March 20th_) Marching from that camp at beat of drum (_i.e._ one hour\r\nbefore day), we dismounted at breakfast-time (9 a.m.) below the\r\nSangdakī-pass, at mid-day marched on, crossed the pass, crossed the\r\ntorrent, and dismounted on the rising-ground.\r\n\r\n(_March 21st_) Marching thence at midnight, we made an excursion to the\r\nford[1434] we had crossed when on our way to Bhīra. A great raft of\r\ngrain had stuck in the mud of that same ford and, do what its owners\r\nwould, could not be made to move. The corn was seized and shared out to\r\nthose with us. Timely indeed was that corn!\r\n\r\nNear noon we were a little below the meeting of the waters of Kābul and\r\nSind, rather above old Nīl-āb; we dismounted there between two\r\nwaters.[1435] From Nīl-āb six boats were brought, and were apportioned\r\nto the right, left and centre, who busied themselves energetically in\r\ncrossing the river (Indus). We got there on a Monday; they kept on\r\ncrossing the water through the night preceding Tuesday (_March 22nd_),\r\nthrough Tuesday and up to Wednesday (_March 23rd_) and on Thursday\r\n(_24th_) also a few crossed.\r\n\r\nHātl's kinsman Parbat, he who from Andarāba was sent to [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n232.] Hātī with a servant of Muḥ. `Alī _Jang-jang_, came to the bank of\r\nthe river with Hātī's offering of an accoutred horse. Nīlābīs also came,\r\nbrought an accoutred horse and did obeisance.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_s. Various postings._)\r\n\r\nMuḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang_ had wished to stay in Bhīra but Bhīra being\r\nbestowed on Hindū Beg, he was given the countries between it and the\r\nSind-river, such as the Qārlūq Hazāra, Hātī, Ghiyāṣ-wāl and Kīb\r\n(Kitib):—\r\n\r\n   Where one is who submits like a _ra`iyat_, so treat him;\r\n   But him who submits not, strike, strip, crush and force to obey.\r\n\r\nHe also received a special head-wear in black velvet, a special Qīlmāq\r\ncorselet, and a standard. When Hātī's kinsman was given leave to go he\r\ntook for Hātī a sword and head-to-foot (_bāsh-ayāq_) with a royal letter\r\nof encouragement.\r\n\r\n(_March 24th_) On Thursday at sunrise we marched from the river's bank.\r\nThat day confection was eaten. While under its influence[1436] wonderful\r\nfields of flowers were enjoyed. In some places sheets of yellow flowers\r\nbloomed in plots; in others sheets of red (_arghwānī_) flowers in plots,\r\nin some red and yellow bloomed together. We sat on a mound near the camp\r\nto enjoy the sight. There were flowers on all sides of the mound, yellow\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 232b.] here, red there, as if arranged regularly to form\r\na sextuple. On two sides there were fewer flowers but as far as the eye\r\nreached, flowers were in bloom. In spring near Parashāwar the fields of\r\nflowers are very beautiful indeed.\r\n\r\n(_March 25th_) We marched from that ground at dawn. At one place on the\r\nroad a tiger came out and roared. On hearing it, the horses,\r\nwilly-nilly, flung off in terror, carrying their riders in all\r\ndirections, and dashing into ravines and hollows. The tiger went again\r\ninto the jungle. To bring it out, we ordered a buffalo brought and put\r\non the edge of the jungle. The tiger again came out roaring. Arrows were\r\nshot at it from all sides[1437]; I shot with the rest. Khalwī (var.\r\nKhalwā) a foot-soldier, pricked it with a spear; it bit the spear and\r\nbroke off the spearhead. After tasting of those arrows, it went into the\r\nbushes (_būta_) and stayed there. Bābā the waiting-man [_yasāwal_] went\r\nwith drawn sword close up to it; it sprang; he chopped at its head; `Alī\r\n_Sīstānī_[1438] chopped at its loins; it plunged into the river and was\r\nkilled right in the water. It was got out and ordered to be skinned.\r\n\r\n(_March 26th_) Marching on next day, we reached Bīgrām and went to see\r\nGūr-khattrī. This is a smallish abode, after the fashion of a hermitage\r\n(_ṣauma`at_), rather confined and dark. After entering at the door and\r\ngoing down a few steps, one must lie full length to get beyond. There is\r\nno getting in without a lamp. All round near the building there is let\r\nlie an enormous quantity of hair of the head and beard which men have\r\nshaved off there. There are a great many retreats (_ḥujra_) near\r\nGūr-khattrī [Sidenote: Fol. 233.] like those of a rest-house or a\r\ncollege. In the year we came into Kābul (910 AH.) and over-ran Kohāt,\r\nBannū and the plain, we made an excursion to Bīgrām, saw its great tree\r\nand were consumed with regret at not seeing Gūr-khattrī, but it does not\r\nseem a place to regret not-seeing.[1439]\r\n\r\nOn this same day an excellent hawk of mine went astray out of Shaikhīm\r\nthe head-falconer's charge; it had taken many cranes and storks and had\r\nmoulted (_tūlāb_) two or three times. So many things did it take that it\r\nmade a fowler of a person so little keen as I!\r\n\r\nAt this place were bestowed 100 mis̤qāls of silver, clothing (_tūnlūq_),\r\nthree bullocks and one buffalo, out of the offerings of Hindūstān, on\r\neach of six persons, the chiefs of the Dilazāk Afghāns under Malik Bū\r\nKhān and Malik Mūsa; to others, in their degree, were given money,\r\npieces of cloth, a bullock and a buffalo.\r\n\r\n(_March 27th_) When we dismounted at `Alī-masjid, a Dilazāk Afghān of\r\nthe Yaq`ūb-khail, named Ma`rūf, brought an offering of 10 sheep, two\r\nass-loads of rice and eight large cheeses.\r\n\r\n(_March 28th_) Marching on from `Alī-masjid, we dismounted at Yada-bīr;\r\nfrom Yada-bīr Jūī-shāhī was reached by the Midday Prayer and we there\r\ndismounted. Today Dost Beg was attacked by burning fever.\r\n\r\n(_March 29th_) Marching from Jūī-shāhī at dawn, we ate our mid-day meal\r\nin the Bāgh-i-wafā. At the Mid-day Prayer we betook ourselves out of the\r\ngarden, close to the Evening Prayer forded the Siyāh-āb at Gandamak,\r\nsatisfied our horses' hunger in a field of green corn, and rode on in a\r\n_garī_ or two (24-48 min.).\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Sūrkh-āb, we dismounted at Kark and took [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 233b.] a sleep.\r\n\r\n(_March 30th_) Riding before shoot of day from Kark, I went with 5 or 6\r\nothers by the road taking off for Qarā-tū in order to enjoy the sight of\r\na garden there made. Khalīfa and Shāh Ḥasan Beg and the rest went by the\r\nother road to await me at Qūrūq-sāī.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Qarā-tū, Shāh Beg _Arghūn's_ commissary (_tawāchī_)\r\nQīzīl (Rufus) brought word that Shāh Beg had taken Kāhān, plundered it\r\nand retired.\r\n\r\nAn order had been given that no-one soever should take news of us ahead.\r\nWe reached Kābul at the Mid-day Prayer, no person in it knowing about us\r\ntill we got to Qūtlūq-qadam's bridge. As Humāyūn and Kāmrān heard about\r\nus only after that, there was not time to put them on horseback; they\r\nmade their pages carry them, came, and did obeisance between the gates\r\nof the town and the citadel.[1440] At the Other Prayer there waited on\r\nme Qāsim Beg, the town Qāẓī, the retainers left in Kābul and the\r\nnotables of the place.\r\n\r\n(_April 2nd_) At the Other Prayer of Friday the 1st of the second Rabī`\r\nthere was a wine-party at which a special head-to-foot (_bāsh-ayāq_) was\r\nbestowed on Shāh Ḥasan.\r\n\r\n(_April 3rd_) At dawn on Saturday we went on board a boat and took our\r\nmorning.[1441] Nūr Beg, then not obedient (_tā'īb_), played the lute at\r\nthis gathering. At the Mid-day Prayer we left the boat to visit the\r\ngarden made between Kul-kīna[1442] and the mountain (Shāh-i-kābul). At\r\nthe Evening Prayer we went to the Violet-garden where there was drinking\r\nagain. From Kul-kīna I got in by the rampart and went into the citadel.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_u. Dost Beg's death._)\r\n\r\n(_April 6th_) On the night of Tuesday the 5th of the month,[1443] Dost\r\nBeg, who on the road had had fever, went to God's mercy. [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n234.]\r\n\r\nSad and grieved enough we were! His bier and corpse were carried to\r\nGhaznī where they laid him in front of the gate of the Sulṯān's garden\r\n(_rauza_).\r\n\r\nDost Beg had been a very good brave (_yīkīt_) and he was still rising in\r\nrank as a beg. Before he was made a beg, he did excellent things several\r\ntimes as one of the household. One time was at Rabāṯ-i-zauraq,[1444] one\r\n_yīghāch_ from Andijān when Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_ attacked me at night (908\r\nAH.). I, with 10 to 15 men, by making a stand, had forced his gallopers\r\nback; when we reached his centre, he made a stand with as many as 100\r\nmen; there were then three men with me, _i.e._ there were four counting\r\nmyself. Nāṣir's Dost (_i.e._ Dost Beg) was one of the three; another was\r\nMīrzā Qulī _Kūkūldāsh_; Karīm-dād _Turkmān_ was the other. I was just in\r\nmy _jība_[1445]; Taṃbal and another were standing like gate-wards in\r\nfront of his array; I came face to face with Taṃbal, shot an arrow\r\nstriking his helm; shot another aiming at the attachment of his\r\nshield;[1446] they shot one through my leg (_būtūm_); Taṃbal chopped at\r\nmy head. It was wonderful! The (under)-cap of my helm was on my head;\r\nnot a thread of it was cut, but on the head itself was a very bad wound.\r\nOf other help came none; no-one was left with me; of necessity I brought\r\nmyself to gallop back. Dost Beg had been a little in my rear; (Taṃbal)\r\non leaving me alone, chopped at him.[1447]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 234b.] Again, when we were getting out of Akhsī [908\r\nAH.],[1448] Dost Beg chopped away at Bāqī _Ḥīz_[1449] who, although\r\npeople called him _Ḥīz_, was a mighty master of the sword. Dost Beg was\r\none of the eight left with me after we were out of Akhsī; he was the\r\nthird they unhorsed.\r\n\r\nAgain, after he had become a beg, when Sīūnjuk Khān (_Aūzbeg_), arriving\r\nwith the (Aūzbeg) sulṯāns before Tāshkīnt, besieged Aḥmad-i-qāsim\r\n[_Kohbur_] in it [918 AH.],[1450] Dost Beg passed through them and\r\nentered the town. During the siege he risked his honoured life\r\nsplendidly, but Aḥmad-i-qāsim, without a word to this honoured\r\nman,[1451] flung out of the town and got away. Dost Beg for his own part\r\ngot the better of the Khān and sulṯāns and made his way well out of\r\nTāshkīnt.\r\n\r\nLater on when Sherīm T̤aghāī, Mazīd and their adherents were in\r\nrebellion,[1452] he came swiftly up from Ghaznī with two or three\r\nhundred men, met three or four hundred effective braves sent out by\r\nthose same Mughūls to meet him, unhorsed a mass of them near\r\nSherūkān(?), cut off and brought in a number of heads.\r\n\r\nAgain, his men were first over the ramparts at the fort of Bajaur (925\r\nAH.). At Parhāla, again, he advanced, beat Hātī, put him to flight, and\r\nwon Parhāla.\r\n\r\nAfter Dost Beg's death, I bestowed his district on his younger brother\r\nNāṣir's Mīrīm.[1453]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_v. Various incidents._)\r\n\r\n(_April 9th_) On Friday the 8th of the second Rabī`, the walled-town was\r\nleft for the Chār-bāgh.\r\n\r\n(_April 13th_) On Tuesday the 12th there arrived in Kābul the honoured\r\nSulṯānīm Begīm, Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā's eldest daughter, the mother of\r\nMuḥammad Sulṯān Mīrzā. During those throneless times,[1454] she had\r\nsettled down in Khwārizm where Yīlī-pārs [Sidenote: Fol. 235.] Sulṯān's\r\nyounger brother Aīsān-qulī Sl. took her daughter. The Bāgh-i-khilwat was\r\nassigned her for her seat. When she had settled down and I went to see\r\nher in that garden, out of respect and courtesy to her, she being as my\r\nhonoured elder sister, I bent the knee. She also bent the knee. We both\r\nadvancing, saw one another mid-way. We always observed the same ceremony\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n(_April 18th_) On Sunday the 17th, that traitor to his salt, Bābā\r\nShaikh[1455] was released from his long imprisonment, forgiven his\r\noffences and given an honorary dress.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_w. Visit to the Koh-dāman._)\r\n\r\n(_April 20th_) On Tuesday the 19th of the month, we rode out at the\r\nreturn of noon for Khwāja Sih-yārān. This day I was fasting. All\r\nastonished, Yūnas-i-`alī and the rest said, \"A Tuesday! a journey! and a\r\nfast! This is amazing!\" At Bīhzādī we dismounted at the Qāẓī's house. In\r\nthe evening when a stir was made for a social gathering, the Qāẓī set\r\nthis before me, \"In my house such things never are; it is for the\r\nhonoured Pādshāh to command!\" For his heart's content, drink was left\r\nout, though all the material for a party was ready.\r\n\r\n(_April 21st_) On Wednesday we went to Khwāja Sih-yārān.\r\n\r\n(_April 22nd_) On Thursday the 22nd of the month, we had a large round\r\nseat made in the garden under construction on the mountain-naze.[1456]\r\n\r\n(_April 23rd_) On Friday we got on a raft from the bridge. On our coming\r\nopposite the fowlers' houses, they brought a _dang_ [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n235b.] (or _ding_)[1457] they had caught. I had never seen one before;\r\nit is an odd-looking bird. It will come into the account of the birds of\r\nHindustan.[1458]\r\n\r\n(_April 24th_) On Saturday the 23rd of the month cuttings were planted,\r\npartly of plane, partly of _tāl_,[1459] above the round seat. At the\r\nMid-day Prayer there was a wine-party at the place.\r\n\r\n(_April 25th_) At dawn we took our morning on the new seat. At noon we\r\nmounted and started for Kābul, reached Khwāja Ḥasan quite drunk and\r\nslept awhile, rode on and by midnight got to the Chār-bāgh. At Khwāja\r\nḤasan, `Abdu'l-lāh, in his drunkenness, threw himself into water just as\r\nhe was in his _tūn aūfrāghī_.[1460] He was frozen with cold and could\r\nnot go on with us when we mounted after a little of the night had\r\npassed. He stayed on Qūtlūq Khwāja's estate that night. Next day,\r\nawakened to his past intemperance, he came on repentant. Said I, \"At\r\nonce! will this sort of repentance answer or not? Would to God you would\r\nrepent now at once in such a way that you would drink nowhere except at\r\nmy parties!\" He agreed to this and kept the rule for a few months, but\r\ncould not keep it longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_x. Hindū Beg abandons Bhīra._)\r\n\r\n(_April 26th_) On Monday the 25th came Hindū Beg. There having been hope\r\nof peace, he had been left in those countries with somewhat scant\r\nsupport. No sooner was our back turned than a mass of Hindūstānīs and\r\nAfghāns gathered, disregarded us and, not listening to our words, moved\r\nagainst Hindū Beg in Bhīra. The local peoples also went over to the\r\nAfghāns. Hindū Beg could make no stand in Bhīra, came to Khūsh-āb, came\r\nthrough the Dīn-kot country, came to Nīl-āb, came on to Kābul.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 236.] Sīktū's son Dīwa _Hindū_ and another Hindū had\r\nbeen brought prisoner from Bhīra. Each now giving a considerable ransom,\r\nthey were released. Horses and head-to-foot dresses having been given\r\nthem, leave to go was granted.\r\n\r\n(_April 30th_) On Friday the 29th of the month, burning fever appeared\r\nin my body. I got myself let blood. I had fever with sometimes two,\r\nsometimes three days between the attacks. In no attack did it cease till\r\nthere had been sweat after sweat. After 10 or 12 days of illness, Mullā\r\nKhwāja gave me narcissus mixed with wine; I drank it once or twice; even\r\nthat did no good.\r\n\r\n(_May 15th_) On Sunday the 15th of the first Jumāda[1461] Khwāja\r\nMuḥammad `Alī came from Khwāst, bringing a saddled horse as an offering\r\nand also _taṣadduq_ money.[1462] Muḥ. Sharīf the astrologer and the\r\nMīr-zādas of Khwāst came with him and waited on me.\r\n\r\n(_May 16th_) Next day, Monday, Mullā Kabīr came from Kāshghar; he had\r\ngone round by Kāshghar on his way from Andijān to Kābul.\r\n\r\n(_May 23rd_) On Monday the 23rd of the month, Malik Shāh Manṣūr\r\n_Yūsuf-zāī_ arrived from Sawād with 6 or 7 Yūsuf-zāī chiefs, and did\r\nobeisance.\r\n\r\n(_May 31st_) On Monday the 1st of the second Jumāda, the chiefs of the\r\nYūsuf-zāī Afghāns led by Malik Shāh Manṣūr were dressed in robes of\r\nhonour (_khil`at_). To Malik Shāh Manṣūr was given a long silk coat and\r\nan under-coat (? _jība_) with its buttons; to one of the other chiefs\r\nwas given a coat with silk sleeves, and to six others silk coats. To all\r\nleave to go was granted. Agreement was made with them that they were not\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 236b.] to reckon as in the country of Sawād what was\r\nabove Abuha (?), that they should make all the peasants belonging to it\r\ngo out from amongst themselves, and also that the Afghān cultivators of\r\nBajaur and Sawād should cast into the revenue 6000 ass-loads of rice.\r\n\r\n(_June 2nd_) On Wednesday the 3rd, I drank _jul-āb_.[1463]\r\n\r\n(_June 5th_) On Saturday the 6th, I drank a working-draught\r\n(_dārū-i-kār_).\r\n\r\n(_June 7th_) On Monday the 8th, arrived the wedding-gift for the\r\nmarriage of Qāsim Beg's youngest son Ḥamza with Khalīfa's eldest\r\ndaughter. It was of 1000 _shāhrukhī_; they offered also a saddled horse.\r\n\r\n(_June 8th_) On Tuesday Shāh Beg's Shāh Ḥasan asked for permission to go\r\naway for a wine-party. He carried off to his house Khwāja Muḥ. `Alī and\r\nsome of the household-begs. In my presence were Yūnas-i-`alī and Gadāī\r\nT̤aghāī. I was still abstaining from wine. Said I, \"Not at all in this\r\nway is it (_hech andāq būlmāī dūr_) that I will sit sober and the party\r\ndrink wine, I stay sane, full of water, and that set (_būlāk_) of people\r\nget drunk; come you and drink in my presence! I will amuse myself a\r\nlittle by watching what intercourse between the sober and the drunk is\r\nlike.\"[1464] The party was held in a smallish tent in which I sometimes\r\nsat, in the Plane-tree garden south-east of the Picture-hall. Later on\r\nGhiyāṣ the house-buffoon (_kīdī_) arrived; several times for fun he was\r\nordered kept out, but at last he made a great disturbance and his\r\nbuffooneries found him a way in. We invited Tardī Muḥammad _Qībchāq_\r\nalso and Mullā _kitāb-dār_ (librarian). The following quatrain, written\r\nimpromptu, was sent to Shāh Ḥasan and those gathered in his [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 237.] house:—\r\n\r\n   In your beautiful flower-bed of banquetting friends,\r\n           Our fashion it is not to be;\r\n   If there be ease (_ḥuzūr_) in that gathering of yours,\r\n   Thank God! there is here no un-ease [_bī ḥuzūr_].[1465]\r\n\r\nIt was sent by Ibrāhīm _chuhra_. Between the two Prayers (_i.e._\r\nafternoon) the party broke up drunk.\r\n\r\nI used to go about in a litter while I was ill. The wine-mixture was\r\ndrunk on several of the earlier days, then, as it did no good I left it\r\noff, but I drank it again at the end of my convalescence, at a party had\r\nunder an apple-tree on the south-west side of the Tālār-garden.\r\n\r\n(_June 11th_) On Friday the 12th came Aḥmad Beg and Sl. Muḥammad\r\n_Dūldāī_ who had been left to help in Bajaur.\r\n\r\n(_June 16th_) On Wednesday the 17th of the month, Tīngrī-bīrdī and other\r\nbraves gave a party in Ḥaidar _Tāqi's_ garden; I also went and there\r\ndrank. We rose from it at the Bed-time Prayer when a move was made to\r\nthe great tent where again there was drinking.\r\n\r\n(_June 23rd_) On Thursday the 25th of the month, Mullā Maḥmūd was\r\nappointed to read extracts from the Qorān[1466] in my presence.\r\n\r\n(_June 28th_) On Tuesday the last day of the month, Abū'l-muslim\r\nKūkūldāsh arrived as envoy from Shāh Shujā` _Arghūn_ bringing a\r\n_tīpūchāq_. After bargain made about swimming the reservoir in the\r\nPlane-tree garden, Yūsuf-i-`alī the stirrup-holder swam round it today\r\n100 times and received a gift of a head-to-foot (dress), a saddled horse\r\nand some money.\r\n\r\n(_July 6th_) On Wednesday the 8th of Rajab, I went to Shāh Ḥasan's house\r\nand drank there; most of the household and of [Sidenote: Fol. 237b.] the\r\nbegs were present.\r\n\r\n(_July 9th_) On Saturday the 11th, there was drinking on the\r\nterrace-roof of the pigeon-house between the Afternoon and Evening\r\nPrayers. Rather late a few horsemen were observed, going from\r\nDih-i-afghān towards the town. It was made out to be Darwīsh-i-muḥammad\r\n_Sārbān_, on his way to me as the envoy of Mīrzā Khān (Wais). We shouted\r\nto him from the roof, \"Drop the envoy's forms and ceremonies! Come! come\r\nwithout formality!\" He came and sat down in the company. He was then\r\nobedient and did not drink. Drinking went on till the end of the\r\nevening. Next day he came into the Court Session with due form and\r\nceremony, and presented Mīrzā Khān's gifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_y. Various incidents._)\r\n\r\nLast year[1467] with 100 efforts, much promise and threats, we had got\r\nthe clans to march into Kābul from the other side (of Hindū-kush). Kābul\r\nis a confined country, not easily giving summer and winter quarters to\r\nthe various flocks and herds of the Turks and (Mughūl?) clans. If the\r\ndwellers in the wilds follow their own hearts, they do not wish for\r\nKābul! They now waited (_khidmat qīlīb_) on Qāsim Beg and made him their\r\nmediator with me for permission to re-cross to that other side. He tried\r\nvery hard, so in the end, they were allowed to cross over to the Qūndūz\r\nand Bāghlān side.\r\n\r\nḤāfiẕ the news-writer's elder brother had come from Samarkand; when I\r\nnow gave him leave to return, I sent my _Dīwān_ by him to Pūlād\r\nSulṯān.[1468] On the back of it I wrote the following [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n238.] verse:—\r\n\r\n   O breeze! if thou enter that cypress' chamber (_ḥarīm_)\r\n   Remind her of me, my heart reft by absence;\r\n   She yearns not for Bābur; he fosters a hope\r\n   That her heart of steel God one day may melt.[1469]\r\n\r\n(_July 15th_) On Friday the 17th of the month, Shaikh Mazīd Kūkūldāsh\r\nwaited on me from Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā, bringing _taṣadduq_ tribute\r\nand a horse.[1470] Today Shāh Beg's envoy Abū'l-muslim Kūkūldāsh was\r\nrobed in an honorary dress and given leave to go. Today also leave was\r\ngiven for their own districts of Khwāst and Andar-āb to Khwāja Muḥammad\r\n`Alī and Tīngrī-bīrdī.\r\n\r\n(_July 21st_) On Thursday the 23rd came Muḥ. `Alī _Jang-jang_ who had\r\nbeen left in charge of the countries near Kacha-kot and the Qārlūq. With\r\nhim came one of Hātī's people and Mīrzā-i-malū-i-qārlūq's son Shāh\r\nḤasan. Today Mullā `Alī-jān waited on me, returned from fetching his\r\nwife from Samarkand.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_z. The `Abdu'r-raḥman Afghāns and Rustam-maidān._)\r\n\r\n(_July 27th_) The `Abdu'r-raḥman Afghāns on the Gīrdīz border were\r\nsatisfactory neither in their tribute nor their behaviour; they were\r\nhurtful also to the caravans which came and went. On Wednesday the 29th\r\nof Rajab we rode out to over-run them. We dismounted and ate food near\r\nTang-i-waghchān,[1471] and rode on again at the Mid-day Prayer. In the\r\nnight we lost the road and got much bewildered in the ups and downs of\r\nthe land to the south-east of Pātakh-i-āb-i-shakna.[1472] After a time\r\nwe lit on [Sidenote: Fol. 238b.] a road and by it crossed the\r\nChashma-i-tūra[1473] pass.\r\n\r\n(_July 28th_) At the first prayer (_farẓ-waqt_) we got out from the\r\nvalley-bottom adjacent[1474] to the level land, and the raid was\r\nallowed. One detachment galloped towards the Kar-māsh[1475] mountain,\r\nsouth-east of Gīrdīz, the left-hand of the centre led by Khusrau, Mīrzā\r\nQulī and Sayyid `Alī in their rear. Most of the army galloped up the\r\ndale to the east of Gīrdīz, having in their rear men under Sayyid Qāsim\r\nLord of the Gate, Mīr Shāh _Qūchīn_, Qayyām (Aūrdū-shāh Beg?), Hindū\r\nBeg, Qūtlūq-qadam and Ḥusain [Ḥasan?]. Most of the army having gone up\r\nthe dale, I followed at some distance. The dalesmen must have been a\r\ngood way up; those who went after them wore their horses out and nothing\r\nto make up for this fell into their hands.\r\n\r\nSome Afghāns on foot, some 40 or 50 of them, having appeared on the\r\nplain, the rear-reserve went towards them. A courier was sent to me and\r\nI hastened on at once. Before I got up with them, Ḥusain Ḥāsan, all\r\nalone, foolishly and thoughtlessly, put his horse at those Afghāns, got\r\nin amongst them and began to lay on with his sword. They shot his horse,\r\nthus made him fall, slashed at him as he was getting up, flung him down,\r\nknifed him from all sides and cut him to pieces, while the other braves\r\nlooked on, standing still and reaching him no helping hand! On hearing\r\nnews of it, I hurried still faster forward, and sent some of the\r\nhousehold and braves galloping loose-rein ahead [Sidenote: Fol. 239.]\r\nunder Gadāī T̤aghāī, Payānda-i-muḥammad _Qīplān_, Abū'l-ḥasan the\r\narmourer and Mūmin Ātāka. Mūmin Ātāka was the first of them to bring an\r\nAfghān down; he speared one, cut off his head and brought it in.\r\nAbū'l-ḥasan the armourer, without mail as he was, went admirably\r\nforward, stopped in front of the Afghāns, laid his horse at them,\r\nchopped at one, got him down, cut off and brought in his head. Known\r\nthough both were for bravelike deeds done earlier, their action in this\r\naffair added to their fame. Every one of those 40 or 50 Afghāns, falling\r\nto the arrow, falling to the sword, was cut in pieces. After making a\r\nclean sweep of them, we dismounted in a field of growing corn and\r\nordered a tower of their heads to be set up. As we went along the road I\r\nsaid, with anger and scorn, to the begs who had been with Ḥusain, \"You!\r\nwhat men! there you stood on quite flat ground, and looked on while a\r\nfew Afghāns on foot overcame such a brave in the way they did! Your rank\r\nand station must be taken from you; you must lose _pargana_ and country;\r\nyour beards must be shaved off and you must be exhibited in towns; for\r\nthere shall be punishment assuredly for him who looks on while such a\r\nbrave is beaten by such a foe [Sidenote: Fol. 239b.] on dead-level land,\r\nand reaches out no hand to help!\" The troop which went to Kar-māsh\r\nbrought back sheep and other spoil. One of them was Bābā Qashqa[1476]\r\n_Mughūl_; an Afghān had made at him with a sword; he had stood still to\r\nadjust an arrow, shot it off and brought his man down.\r\n\r\n(_July 29th_) Next day at dawn we marched for Kābul. Pay-aster Muḥammad,\r\n`Abdu'l-`azīz Master of the Horse, and Mīr Khūrd the taster were ordered\r\nto stop at Chashma-tūra, and get pheasants from the people there.\r\n\r\nAs I had never been along the Rustam-maidān road,[1477] I went with a\r\nfew men to see it. Rustam-plain (_maidān_) lies amongst mountains and\r\ntowards their head is not a very charming place. The dale spreads rather\r\nbroad between its two ranges. To the south, on the skirt of the\r\nrising-ground is a smallish spring, having very large poplars near it.\r\nThere are many trees also, but not so large, at the source on the way\r\nout of Rustam-maidān for Gīrdīz. This is a narrower dale, but still\r\nthere is a plot of green meadow below the smaller trees mentioned, and\r\nthe little dale is charming. From the summit of the range, looking\r\nsouth, the Karmāsh and Bangash mountains are seen at one's feet; and\r\nbeyond the Karmāsh show pile upon pile of the rain-clouds of Hindūstān.\r\nTowards those other lands where no rain falls, not [Sidenote: Fol. 240.]\r\na cloud is seen.\r\n\r\nWe reached Hūnī at the Mid-day Prayer and there dismounted.\r\n\r\n(_July 30th_) Dismounting next day at Muḥammad Āghā's village,[1478] we\r\nperpetrated (_irtqāb_) a _ma'jūn_. There we had a drug thrown into water\r\nfor the fish; a few were taken.[1479]\r\n\r\n(_July 31st_) On Sunday the 3rd of Sha`bān, we reached Kābul.\r\n\r\n(_August 2nd_) On Tuesday the 5th of the month, Darwīsh-i-muḥammad\r\n_Faẓlī_ and Khusrau's servants were summoned and, after enquiry made\r\ninto what short-comings of theirs there may have been when Ḥusain was\r\novercome, they were deprived of place and rank. At the Mid-day Prayer\r\nthere was a wine-party under a plane-tree, at which an honorary dress\r\nwas given to Bābā Qashqa _Mughūl_.\r\n\r\n(_August 5th_) On Friday the 8th Kīpa returned from the presence of\r\nMīrzā Khān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_aa. Excursion to the Koh-dāman._)\r\n\r\n(_August 11th_) On Thursday at the Other Prayer, I mounted for an\r\nexcursion to the Koh-dāman, Bārān and Khwāja Sih-yārān.[1480] At the\r\nBed-time Prayer, we dismounted at Māmā Khātūn.[1481]\r\n\r\n(_August 12th_) Next day we dismounted at Istālīf; a confection was\r\neaten on that day.\r\n\r\n(_August 13th_) On Saturday there was a wine-party at Istālīf.\r\n\r\n(_August 14th_) Riding at dawn from Istālīf, we crossed the space\r\nbetween it and the Sinjid-valley. Near Khwāja Sih-yārān a great snake\r\nwas killed as thick, it may be, as the fore-arm and as long as a\r\n_qūlāch_.[1482] From its inside came out a slenderer snake, that seemed\r\nto have been just swallowed, every part of it being [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n240b.] whole; it may have been a little shorter than the larger one.\r\nFrom inside this slenderer snake came out a little mouse; it too was\r\nwhole, broken nowhere.[1483]\r\n\r\nOn reaching Khwāja Sih-yārān there was a wine-party. Today orders were\r\nwritten and despatched by Kīch-kīna the night-watch (_tūnqṯār_) to the\r\nbegs on that side (_i.e._ north of Hindū-kush), giving them a rendezvous\r\nand saying, \"An army is being got to horse, take thought, and come to\r\nthe rendezvous fixed.\"\r\n\r\n(_August 15th_) We rode out at dawn and ate a confection. At the infall\r\nof the Parwān-water many fish were taken in the local way of casting a\r\nfish-drug into the water.[1484] Mīr Shāh Beg set food and water (_āsh u\r\nāb_) before us; we then rode on to Gul-bahār. At a wine-party held after\r\nthe Evening Prayer, Darwīsh-i-muḥammad (_Sārbān_) was present. Though a\r\nyoung man and a soldier, he had not yet committed the sin (_irtqāb_) of\r\nwine, but was in obedience (_tā'ib_). Qūtlūq Khwāja _Kūkūldāsh_ had long\r\nbefore abandoned soldiering to become a darwīsh; moreover he was very\r\nold, his very beard was quite white; nevertheless he took his share of\r\nwine at these parties. Said I to Darwīsh-i-muḥammad, \"Qūtlūq Khwāja's\r\nbeard shames you! He, a darwīsh and an old man, always drinks wine; you,\r\na soldier, a young man, your beard quite black, never drink! What does\r\nit mean?\" My custom being not to press wine on a non-drinker, with so\r\nmuch said, it all passed off as a joke; he was not pressed to drink.\r\n\r\n(_August 16th_) At dawn we made our morning (_ṣubāḥī ṣubūḥī qīldūk_).\r\n\r\n(_August 17th_) Riding on Wednesday from Gul-i-bahār, we [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n241.] dismounted in Abūn-village[1485], ate food, remounted, went to a\r\nsummer-house in the orchards (_bāghāt-i-kham_) and there dismounted.\r\nThere was a wine-party after the Mid-day Prayer.\r\n\r\n(_August 18th_) Riding on next day, we made the circuit of Khwāja\r\nKhāwand Sa`īd's tomb, went to China-fort and there got on a raft. Just\r\nwhere the Panjhīr-water comes in, the raft struck the naze of a hill and\r\nbegan to sink. Rauḥ-dam, Tīngrī-qulī and Mīr Muḥammad the raftsman were\r\nthrown into the water by the shock; Rauḥ-dam and Tīngrī-qulī were got on\r\nthe raft again; a China cup and a spoon and a ṯambour went into the\r\nwater. Lower down, the raft struck again opposite the Sang-i-barīda (the\r\ncut-stone), either on a branch in mid-stream or on a stake stuck in as a\r\nstop-water (_qāqghān qāzūq_). Right over on his back went Shāh Beg's\r\nShāh Ḥasan, clutching at Mīrzā Qulī Kūkūldāsh and making him fall too.\r\nDarwīsh-i-muḥammad _Sārbān_ was also thrown into the water. Mīrzā Qulī\r\nwent over in his own fashion! Just when he fell, he was cutting a melon\r\nwhich he had in his hand; as he went over, he stuck his knife into the\r\nmat of the raft. He swam in his _tūn aūfrāghī_[1486] and got out of the\r\nwater without coming on the raft again. Leaving it that night, we slept\r\nat raftsmen's houses. Darwīsh-i-muḥammad _Sārbān_ presented me with a\r\nseven-coloured cup exactly like the one lost in the water.\r\n\r\n(_August 19th_) On Friday we rode away from the river's bank and\r\ndismounted below Aīndīkī on the skirt of Koh-i-bacha where, with our own\r\nhands, we gathered plenty of tooth-picks.[1487] [Sidenote: Fol. 241b.]\r\nPassing on, food was eaten at the houses of the Khwāja Khiẓr people. We\r\nrode on and at the Mid-day Prayer, dismounted in a village of Qūtlūq\r\nKhwāja's fief in Lamghān where he made ready a hasty meal (_mā ḥaẓirī_);\r\nafter partaking of this, we mounted and went to Kābul.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_bb. Various incidents._)\r\n\r\n(_August 22nd_) On Monday the 25th, a special honorary dress and a\r\nsaddled horse were bestowed on Darwīsh-i-muḥammad _Sārbān_ and he was\r\nmade to kneel as a retainer (_naukar_).\r\n\r\n(_August 24th_) For 4 or 5 months I had not had my head shaved; on\r\nWednesday the 27th, I had it done. Today there was a wine-party.\r\n\r\n(_August 26th_) On Friday the 29th, Mīr Khūrd was made to kneel as\r\nHind-āl's guardian.[1488] He made an offering of 1000 _shāhrukhīs_\r\n(_circa_ £50).\r\n\r\n(_August 31st_) On Wednesday the 5th of Ramẓān, a dutiful letter was\r\nbrought by Tūlik Kūkūldāsh's servant Barlās Jūkī(?). Aūzbeg raiders had\r\ngone into those parts (Badakhshān); Tūlik had gone out, fought and\r\nbeaten them. Barlās Jūkī brought one live Aūzbeg and one head.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 2nd_) In the night of Saturday the 8th, we broke our fast[1489]\r\nin Qāsim Beg's house; he led out a saddled horse for me.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 3rd_) On Sunday night the fast was broken in Khalīfa's house; he\r\noffered me a saddled horse.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 4th_) Next day came Khwāja Muḥ. `Alī and Jān-i-nāṣir who had been\r\nsummoned from their districts for the good of the army.[1490]\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 7th_) On Wednesday the 12th, Kāmrān's maternal uncle [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 242.] Sl. `Alī Mīrzā arrived.[1491] As has been mentioned,[1492] he\r\nhad gone to Kāshghar in the year I came from Khwāst into Kābul.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_cc. A Yūsuf-zāī campaign._)\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 8th_) We rode out on Thursday the 13th of the month of Ramẓān,\r\nresolved and determined to check and ward off the Yūsuf-zāī, and we\r\ndismounted in the meadow on the Dih-i-yaq`ūb side of Kābul. When we were\r\nmounting, the equerry Bābā Jān led forward a rather good-for-nothing\r\nhorse; in my anger I struck him in the face a blow which dislocated my\r\nfist below the ring-finger.[1493] The pain was not much at the time, but\r\nwas rather bad when we reached our encampment-ground. For some time I\r\nsuffered a good deal and could not write. It got well at last.\r\n\r\nTo this same assembly-ground were brought letters and presents (_bīlāk_)\r\nfrom my maternal-aunt Daulat-sulṯān Khānīm[1494] in Kāshghar, by her\r\nfoster-brother Daulat-i-muḥammad. On the same day Bū Khān and Mūsa,\r\nchiefs of the Dilazāk, came, bringing tribute, and did obeisance.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 11th_) On Sunday the 16th Qūj Beg came.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 14th_) Marching on Wednesday the 19th we passed through Būt-khāk\r\nand, as usual, dismounted on the Būt-khāk water.[1495]\r\n\r\nAs Qūj Beg's districts, Bāmīān, Kāh-mard and Ghūrī, are close to the\r\nAūzbeg, he was excused from going with this army and given leave to\r\nreturn to them from this ground. I bestowed on him a turban twisted for\r\nmyself, and also a head-to-foot (_bāsh-ayāq_).\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 16th_) On Friday the 21st, we dismounted at Badām-chashma.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 242b.]\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 17th_) Next day we dismounted on the Bārīk-āb, I reaching the\r\ncamp after a visit to Qarā-tū. On this ground honey was obtained from a\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 20th_) We went on march by march till Wednesday the 26th, and\r\ndismounted in the Bāgh-i-wafā.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 21st_) Thursday we just stayed in the garden.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 22nd_) On Friday we marched out and dismounted beyond Sulṯānpūr.\r\nToday Shāh Mīr Ḥusain came from his country. Today came also Dilazāk\r\nchiefs under Bū Khān and Mūsa. My plan had been to put down the\r\nYūsuf-zāī in Sawād, but these chiefs set forth to me that there was a\r\nlarge horde (_aūlūs_) in Hash-naghar and that much corn was to be had\r\nthere. They were very urgent for us to go to Hash-naghar. After\r\nconsultation the matter was left in this way:—As it is said there is\r\nmuch corn in Hash-naghar, the Afghāns there shall be overrun; the forts\r\nof Hash-naghar and Parashāwar shall be put into order; part of the corn\r\nshall be stored in them and they be left in charge of Shāh Mīr Ḥusain\r\nand a body of braves. To suit Shāh Mīr Ḥusain's convenience in this, he\r\nwas given 15 days leave, with a rendezvous named for him to come to\r\nafter going to his country and preparing his equipment.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 23rd_) Marching on next day, we reached Jūī-shāhī and there\r\ndismounted. On this ground Tīngrī-bīrdī and Sl. Muḥammad _Dūldāī_\r\novertook us. Today came also Ḥamza from Qūndūz.[1496]\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 25th_) On Sunday the last day of the month (Ramẓān), we marched\r\nfrom Jūī-shāhī and dismounted at Qīrīq-arīq (forty-conduits), [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 243.] I going by raft, with a special few. The new moon of the\r\nFeast was seen at that station.[1497] People had brought a few\r\nbeast-loads of wine from Nūr-valley;[1498] after the Evening Prayer\r\nthere was a wine-party, those present being Muḥibb-i-`alī the armourer,\r\nKhwāja Muḥ. `Alī the librarian, Shāh Beg's Shāh Ḥasan, Sl. Muḥ. _Dūldāī_\r\nand Darwīsh-i-muḥ. _Sārbān,_ then obedient (_tā'ib_). From my childhood\r\nup it had been my rule not to press wine on a non-drinker;\r\nDarwīsh-i-muḥammad was at every party and no pressure was put on him (by\r\nme), but Khwāja Muḥ. `Alī left him no choice; he pressed him and pressed\r\nhim till he made him drink.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 26th_) On Monday we marched with the dawn of the Feast-day,[1499]\r\neating a confection on the road to dispel crop-sickness. While under its\r\ncomposing influence (_nāklīk_), we were brought a colocynth-apple\r\n(_khunṯul_). Darwīsh-i-muḥammad had never seen one; said I, \"It is a\r\nmelon of Hindūstān,\" sliced it and gave him a piece. He bit into it at\r\nonce; it was night before the bitter taste went out of his mouth. At\r\nGarm-chashma we dismounted on rising-ground where cold meat was being\r\nset out for us when Langar Khān arrived to wait on me after being for a\r\ntime at his own place (Koh-i-jūd). He brought an offering of a horse and\r\na few confections. Passing on, we dismounted at Yada-bīr, at the Other\r\nPrayer got on a raft there, went for as much as two miles on it, then\r\nleft it.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 27th_) Riding on next morning, we dismounted below the\r\nKhaibar-pass. Today arrived Sl. Bāyazīd, come up by the [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n243b.] Bāra-road after hearing of us; he set forth that the Afrīdī\r\nAfghāns were seated in Bāra with their goods and families and that they\r\nhad grown a mass of corn which was still standing (lit. on foot). Our\r\nplan being for the Yūsuf-zāī Afghāns of Hash-naghar, we paid him no\r\nattention. At the Mid-day Prayer there was a wine-party in Khwāja\r\nMuḥammad `Alī's tent. During the party details about our coming in this\r\ndirection were written and sent off by the hand of a sulṯān of Tīrah to\r\nKhwāja Kalān in Bajaur. I wrote this couplet on the margin of the letter\r\n(_farmān_):—\r\n\r\n   Say sweetly o breeze, to that beautiful fawn,\r\n   Thou hast given my head to the hills and the wild.[1500]\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 28th_) Marching on at dawn across the pass, we got through the\r\nKhaibar-narrows and dismounted at `Alī-masjid. At the Mid-day Prayer we\r\nrode on, leaving the baggage behind, reached the Kābul-water at the\r\nsecond watch (midnight) and there slept awhile.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 29th_) A ford[1501] was found at daylight; we had forded the\r\nwater (_sū-dīn kīchīldī_), when news came from our scout that the\r\nAfghāns had heard of us and were in flight. We went on, passed through\r\nthe Sawād-water and dismounted amongst the Afghān corn-fields. Not a\r\nhalf, not a fourth indeed of the promised corn was had. The plan of\r\nfitting-up Hash-naghar, made under the hope of getting corn here, came\r\nto nothing. [Sidenote: Fol. 244.] The Dilazāk Afghāns, who had urged it\r\non us, were ashamed. We next dismounted after fording the water of Sawād\r\nto its Kābul side.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 30th_) Marching next morning from the Sawād-water, we crossed the\r\nKābul-water and dismounted. The Begs admitted to counsel were summoned\r\nand a consultation having been had, the matter was left at this:—that\r\nthe Afrīdī Afghāns spoken of by Sl. Bāyazīd should be over-run,\r\nPūrshāwūr-fort be fitted up on the strength of their goods and corn, and\r\nsome-one left there in charge.\r\n\r\nAt this station Hindū Beg _Qūchīn_ and the Mīr-zādas of Khwāst overtook\r\nus. Today _ma'jūn_ was eaten, the party being Darwesh-i-muḥammad\r\n_Sārbān_, Muḥammad Kūkūldāsh, Gadāī T̤aghāī and `Asas; later on we\r\ninvited Shāh Ḥasan also. After food had been placed before us, we went\r\non a raft, at the Other Prayer. We called Langar Khān _Nīa-zāī_ on also.\r\nAt the Evening Prayer we got off the raft and went to camp.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 1st_) Marching at dawn, in accordance with the arrangement made\r\non the Kābul-water, we passed Jām and dismounted at the outfall of the\r\n`Alī-masjid water.[1502]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_dd. Badakhshān affairs._)\r\n\r\nSl. `Alī (T̤aghāī's servant ?) Abū'l-hāshim overtaking us, said, \"On the\r\nnight of `Arafa,[1503] I was in Jūī-shāhī with a person from Badakhshān;\r\nhe told me that Sl. Sa`īd Khān had come with designs on Badakhshān, so I\r\ncame on from Jūī-shāhī along the Jām-rūd, to give the news to the\r\nPādshāh.\" On this the begs were summoned and advice was taken. In\r\nconsequence of this [Sidenote: Fol. 244b.] news, it seemed inadvisable\r\nto victual the fort (Pūrshāwūr), and we started back intending to go to\r\nBadakhshān.[1504] Langar Khān was appointed to help Muḥ. `Alī\r\n_Jang-jang_; he was given an honorary dress and allowed to go.\r\n\r\nThat night a wine-party was held in Khwāja Muḥ. `Alī's tent. We marched\r\non next day, crossed Khaibar and dismounted below the pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ee. The Khiẓr-khail Afghāns._)\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 3rd_) Many improper things the Khiẓr-khail had done! When the\r\narmy went to and fro, they used to shoot at the laggards and at those\r\ndismounted apart, in order to get their horses. It seemed lawful\r\ntherefore and right to punish them. With this plan we marched from below\r\nthe pass at daybreak, ate our mid-day meal in Dih-i-ghulāmān\r\n(Basaul),[1505] and after feeding our horses, rode on again at the\r\nMid-day Prayer.\r\n\r\nMuḥ Ḥusain the armourer was made to gallop off to Kābul with orders to\r\nkeep prisoner all Khiẓr-khailīs there, and to submit to me an account of\r\ntheir possessions; also, to write a detailed account of whatever news\r\nthere was from Badakhshān and to send a man off with it quickly from\r\nKābul to me.\r\n\r\nThat night we moved on till the second watch (midnight), got a little\r\nbeyond Sulṯānpūr, there slept awhile, then rode on again. The\r\nKhiẓr-khail were understood to have their seat from Bahār (Vihāra?) and\r\nMīch-grām to Karā-sū (_sic_). Arriving before dawn, (_Oct. 4th_) the\r\nraid was allowed. Most of the goods of the Khiẓr-khailīs and their small\r\nchildren fell into the army's hands; a few tribesmen, being near the\r\nmountains, drew off to [Sidenote: Fol. 245.] them and were left.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 5th_) We dismounted next day at Qīlaghū where pheasants were\r\ntaken on our ground. Today the baggage came up from the rear and was\r\nunloaded here. Owing to this punitive raid, the Wazīrī Afghāns who never\r\nhad given in their tribute well, brought 300 sheep.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 9th_) I had written nothing since my hand was dislocated; here I\r\nwrote a little, on Sunday the 14th of the month.[1506]\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 10th_) Next day came Afghān chiefs leading the Khirilchī [and]\r\nSamū-khail. The Dilazāk Afghāns entreated pardon for them; we gave it\r\nand set the captured free, fixed their tribute at 4000 sheep, gave coats\r\n(_tūn_) to their chiefs, appointed and sent out collectors.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 13th_) These matters settled, we marched on Thursday the 18th,\r\nand dismounted at Bahār (Vihāra?) and Mīch-grām.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 14th_) Next day I went to the Bāgh-i-wafā. Those were the days of\r\nthe garden's beauty; its lawns were one sheet of trefoil; its\r\npomegranate-trees yellowed to autumn splendour,[1507] their fruit full\r\nred; fruit on the orange-trees green and glad (_khurram_), countless\r\noranges but not yet as yellow as our hearts desired! The pomegranates\r\nwere excellent, not equal, however, to the best ones of Wilāyat.[1508]\r\nThe one excellent and blessed content we have had from the Bāgh-i-wafā\r\nwas had at this time. [Sidenote: Fol. 245b.] We were there three or four\r\ndays; during the time the whole camp had pomegranates in abundance.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 17th_) We marched from the garden on Monday. I stayed in it till\r\nthe first watch (9 a.m.) and gave away oranges; I bestowed the fruit of\r\ntwo trees on Shāh Ḥasan; to several begs I gave the fruit of one tree\r\neach; to some gave one tree for two persons. As we were thinking of\r\nvisiting Lamghān in the winter, I ordered that they should reserve\r\n(_qūrūghlāīlār_) at least 20 of the trees growing round the reservoir.\r\nThat day we dismounted at Gandamak.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 18th_) Next day we dismounted at Jagdālīk. Near the Evening\r\nPrayer there was a wine-party at which most of the household were\r\npresent. After a time Qāsim Beg's sister's son Gadāī _bihjat_[1509] used\r\nvery disturbing words and, being drunk, slid down on the cushion by my\r\nside, so Gadāī T̤aghāī picked him up and carried him out from the party.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 19th_) Marching next day from that ground, I made an excursion up\r\nthe valley-bottom of the Bārīk-āb towards Qūrūq-sāī. A few purslain\r\ntrees were in the utmost autumn beauty. On dismounting, seasonable[1510]\r\nfood was set out. The vintage was the cause! wine was drunk! A sheep\r\nwas ordered brought from the road and made into _kabābs_ (_brochettes_).\r\nWe amused ourselves by setting fire to branches of holm-oak.[1511]\r\n\r\nMullā `Abdu'l-malik _dīwāna_[1512] having begged to take the news of our\r\ncoming into Kābul, was sent ahead. To this place came Ḥasan Nabīra from\r\nMīrzā Khān's presence; he must have come after letting me know [his\r\nintention of coming].[1513] There was [Sidenote: Fol. 246.] drinking\r\ntill the Sun's decline; we then rode off. People in our party had become\r\nvery drunk, Sayyid Qāsim so much so, that two of his servants mounted\r\nhim and got him into camp with difficulty. Muḥ. Bāqir's Dost was so\r\ndrunk that people, headed by Amīn-i-muḥammad Tarkhān and Mastī _chuhra_,\r\ncould not get him on his horse; even when they poured water on his head,\r\nnothing was effected. At that moment a body of Afghāns appeared.\r\nAmīn-i-muḥammad, who had had enough himself, had this idea, \"Rather than\r\nleave him here, as he is, to be taken, let us cut his head off and carry\r\nit with us.\" At last after 100 efforts, they mounted him and brought him\r\nwith them. We reached Kābul at midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ff. Incidents in Kābul._)\r\n\r\nIn Court next morning Qulī Beg waited on me. He had been to Sl. Sa'īd\r\nKhān's presence in Kāshghar as my envoy. To him as envoy to me had been\r\nadded Bīshka Mīrzā _Itārchī_[1514] who brought me gifts of the goods of\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 25th_) On Wednesday the 1st of Ẕū'l-qa`da, I went by myself to\r\nQābil's tomb[1515] and there took my morning. The people of the party\r\ncame later by ones and twos. When the Sun waxed hot, we went to the\r\nViolet-garden and drank there, by the side of the reservoir. Mid-day\r\ncoming on, we slept. At the Mid-day Prayer we drank again. At this\r\nmid-day party I gave wine to Tīngrī-qulī Beg and to Mahndī (?) to whom\r\nat any earlier party, wine had not been given. At the Bed-time\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 246b.] Prayer, I went to the Hot-bath where I stayed the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 26th_) On Thursday honorary dresses were bestowed on the\r\nHindūstānī traders, headed by Yaḥya _Nūḥānī_, and they were allowed to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 28th_) On Saturday the 4th, a dress and gifts were bestowed on\r\nBīshka Mīrzā, who had come from Kāshghar, and he was given leave to go.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 29th_) On Sunday there was a party in the little Picture-hall\r\nover the (Chār-bāgh) gate; small retreat though it is, 16 persons were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_gg. Excursion to the Koh-dāman._)\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 30th_) Today we went to Istālīf to see the harvest (_khizān_).\r\nToday was done the sin (? _irtikāb qīlīb aīdī_) of _ma'jūn_. Much rain\r\nfell; most of the begs and the household came into my tent, outside the\r\nBāgh-i-kalān.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 31st_) Next day there was a wine-party in the same garden,\r\nlasting till night.\r\n\r\n(_November 1st_) At dawn we took our morning (_ṣubāḥī ṣubūḥī qīldūk_)\r\nand got drunk, took a sleep, and at the Mid-day Prayer rode from\r\nIstālīf. On the road a confection was eaten. We reached Bih-zādī at the\r\nOther Prayer. The harvest-crops were very beautiful; while we were\r\nviewing them those disposed for wine began to agitate about it. The\r\nharvest-colour was extremely beautiful; wine was drunk, though _ma'jūn_\r\nhad been eaten, sitting under autumnal trees. The party lasted till the\r\nBed-time Prayer. Khalīfa's Mullā Maḥmūd arriving, we had him summoned to\r\njoin the party. `Abdu'l-lāh was very drunk [Sidenote: Fol. 247.] indeed;\r\na word affecting Khalīfa (_ṯarfidīn_) being said, `Abdu'l-lāh forgot\r\nMullā Maḥmūd and recited this line:—\r\n\r\n   Regard whom thou wilt, he suffers from the same wound.[1516]\r\n\r\nMullā Maḥmūd was sober; he blamed `Abdu'l-lāh for repeating that line in\r\njest; `Abdu'l-lāh came to his senses, was troubled in mind, and after\r\nthis talked and chatted very sweetly.\r\n\r\nOur excursion to view the harvest was over; we dismounted, close to the\r\nEvening Prayer, in the Chār-bāgh.\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 12th_) On Friday the 16th, after eating a confection\r\n\r\nwith a few special people in the Violet-garden, we went on a boat.\r\nHumāyūn and Kāmrān were with us later; Humāyūn made a very good shot at\r\na duck.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_hh. A Bohemian episode._)\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 14th_) On Saturday the 18th, I rode out of the Chār-bāgh at\r\nmidnight, sent night-watch and groom back, crossed Mullā Bābā's bridge,\r\ngot out by the Dīūrīn-narrows, round by the bāzārs and _kārez_ of\r\nQūsh-nādur (var.), along the back of the Bear-house (_khirs-khāna_), and\r\nnear sunrise reached Tardī Beg _Khāk-sār's[1517] kārez_. He ran out\r\nquickly on hearing of me. His shortness (_qālāshlīghī_) was known; I had\r\ntaken 100 _shāhrukhīs_ (£5) with me; I gave him these and told him to\r\nget wine and other things ready as I had a fancy for a private and\r\nunrestrained party. He went for wine towards Bih-zādī[1518]; I sent my\r\nhorse by his slave to the valley-bottom and sat down on the slope behind\r\nthe _kārez_. At the first watch (9 a.m.) Tardī Beg brought [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 247b.] a pitcher of wine which we drank by turns. After him came\r\nMuḥammad-i-qāsim _Barlās_ and Shāh-zāda who had got to know of his\r\nfetching the wine, and had followed him, their minds quite empty of any\r\nthought about me. We invited them to the party. Said Tardī Beg, \"Hul-hul\r\nAnīga wishes to drink wine with you.\" Said I, \"For my part, I never saw\r\na woman drink wine; invite her.\" We also invited Shāhī a qalandar, and\r\none of the _kārez_-men who played the rebeck. There was drinking till\r\nthe Evening Prayer on the rising-ground behind the _kārez_; we then went\r\ninto Tardī Beg's house and drank by lamp-light almost till the Bed-time\r\nPrayer. The party was quite free and unpretending. I lay down, the\r\nothers went to another house and drank there till beat of drum\r\n(midnight). Hul-hul Anīga came in and made me much disturbance; I got\r\nrid of her at last by flinging myself down as if drunk. It was in my\r\nmind to put people off their guard, and ride off alone to Astar-ghach,\r\nbut it did not come off because they got to know. In the end, I rode\r\naway at beat of drum, after letting Tardī Beg and Shāh-zāda know. We\r\nthree mounted and made for Astar-ghach.\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 15th_) We reached Khwāja Ḥasan below Istālīf by the first prayer\r\n(_farẓ waqt_); dismounted for a while, ate a confection, [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n248.] and went to view the harvest. When the Sun was up, we dismounted\r\nat a garden in Istālīf and ate grapes. We slept at Khwāja Shahāb, a\r\ndependency of Astar-ghach. Ātā, the Master of the Horse, must have had a\r\nhouse somewhere near, for before we were awake he had brought food and a\r\npitcher of wine. The vintage was very fine. After drinking a few cups,\r\nwe rode on. We next dismounted in a garden beautiful with autumn; there\r\na party was held at which Khwāja Muḥammad Amīn joined us. Drinking went\r\non till the Bed-time Prayer. During that day and night `Abdu'l-lāh,\r\n`Asas, Nūr Beg and Yūsuf-i-`alī all arrived from Kābul.\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 16th_) After food at dawn, we rode out and visited the\r\nBāgh-i-pādshāhī below Astar-ghach. One young apple-tree in it had turned\r\nan admirable autumn-colour; on each branch were left 5 or 6 leaves in\r\nregular array; it was such that no painter trying to depict it could\r\nhave equalled. After riding from Astar-ghach we ate at Khwāja Ḥasan, and\r\nreached Bih-zādī at the Evening Prayer. There we drank in the house of\r\nKhwāja Muḥ. Amīn's servant Imām-i-muḥammad.\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 17th_) Next day, Tuesday, we went into the Chār-bāgh of Kābul.\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 18th_) On Thursday the 23rd, having marched (_kūchūb_), the fort\r\nwas entered.\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 19th_) On Friday Muḥammad `Alī (son of ?) Ḥaidar the\r\nstirrup-holder brought, as an offering, a _tūīgūn_[1519] he had caught.\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 20th_) On Saturday the 25th, there was a party in the Plane-tree\r\ngarden from which I rose and mounted at the Bed-time Prayer. Sayyid\r\nQāsim being in shame at past occurrences,[1520] we dismounted at his\r\nhouse and drank a few cups.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 248b.] (_Nov. 24th_) On Thursday the 1st of Ẕū'l-ḥijja,\r\nTāju'd-dīn Maḥmūd, come from Qandahār, waited on me.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 12th_) On Monday the 19th, Muḥ. `Alī _Jang-jang_ came from\r\nNīl-āb.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 13th_) On Tuesday the ... of the month, Sangar Khān _Janjūha_,\r\ncome from Bhīra, waited on me.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 16th_) On Friday the 23rd, I finished (copying?) the odes and\r\ncouplets selected according to their measure from `Alī-sher Beg's four\r\nDīwāns.[1521]\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 20th_) On Tuesday the 27th there was a social-gathering in the\r\ncitadel, at which it was ordered that if any-one went out from it drunk,\r\nthat person should not be invited to a party again.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 23rd_) On Friday the 30th of Ẕū'l-ḥijja it was ridden out with\r\nthe intention of making an excursion to Lamghān.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n926 AH.-DEC. 23RD 1519 TO DEC. 12TH 1520 AD.[1522]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Excursion to the Koh-dāman and Kohistān._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 23rd_) On Saturday Muḥarram 1st Khwāja Sih-yārān was reached. A\r\nwine-party was had on the bank of the conduit, where this comes out on\r\nthe hill.[1523]\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 24th_) Riding on next morning (2nd), we visited the moving sands\r\n(_reg-i-rawān_). A party was held in Sayyid Qāsim's _Bulbul's_\r\nhouse.[1524]\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 25th_) Riding on from there, we ate a confection (_ma'jūn_), went\r\nfurther and dismounted at Bilkir (?).\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 26th_) At dawn (4th) we made our morning [_ṣubāḥī ṣubūḥī\r\nqīldūk_], although there might be drinking at night. We rode on at the\r\nMid-day Prayer, dismounted at Dūr-nāma[1525] and there had a wine party.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 27th_) We took our morning early. Ḥaq-dād, the headman of\r\nDūr-namā made me an offering (_pesh-kash_) of his garden.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 28th_) Riding thence on Thursday (6th), we dismounted at the\r\nvillages of the Tājiks in Nijr-aū.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 29th_) On Friday (7th) we hunted the hill between Forty-ploughs\r\n(_Chihil-qulba_) and the water of Bārān; many deer fell. [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n249.] I had not shot an arrow since my hand was hurt; now, with an\r\neasy[1526] bow, I shot a deer in the shoulder, the arrow going in to\r\nhalf up the feather. Returning from hunting, we went on at the Other\r\nPrayer in Nijr-aū.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 30th_) Next day (Saturday 8th) the tribute of the Nijr-aū people\r\nwas fixed at 60 gold mis̤qāls.[1527]\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 1st_) On Monday (10th) we rode on intending to visit\r\nLamghān.[1528] I had expected Humāyūn to go with us, but as he inclined\r\nto stay behind, leave was given him from Kūra-pass. We went on and\r\ndismounted in Badr-aū (Tag-aū).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Excursions in Lamghān._)\r\n\r\n(_Jan. ..._) Riding on, we dismounted at Aūlūgh-nūr.[1529] The fishermen\r\nthere took fish at one draught[1530] from the water of Bārān. At the\r\nOther Prayer (afternoon) there was drinking on the raft; and there was\r\ndrinking in a tent after we left the raft at the Evening Prayer.\r\n\r\nḤaidar the standard-bearer had been sent from Dāwar[1531] to the Kāfirs;\r\nseveral Kāfir headmen came now to the foot of Bād-i-pīch (pass), brought\r\na few goat-skins of wine, and did obeisance. In descending that pass a\r\nsurprising number of ...[1532] was seen.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. ..._) Next day getting on a raft, we ate a confection, got off\r\nbelow Būlān and went to camp. There were two rafts.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 5th_) Marching on Friday (14th), we dismounted below Mandrāwar on\r\nthe hill-skirt. There was a late wine-party.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 6th_) On Saturday (15th), we passed through the Darūta narrows by\r\nraft, got off a little above Jahān-namā'ī (Jalālābād) and went to the\r\nBāgh-i-wafā in front of Adīnapūr. When we were leaving the raft the\r\ngovernor of Nīngnahār Qayyām Aūrdū Shāh came and did obeisance. Langar\r\nKhān _Nīā-zāī_,—he had [Sidenote: Fol. 249b.] been in Nīl-āb for a\r\ntime,—waited upon me on the road. We dismounted in the Bāgh-i-wafā; its\r\noranges had yellowed beautifully; its spring-bloom was well-advanced,\r\nand it was very charming. We stayed in it five or six days.\r\n\r\nAs it was my wish and inclination (_jū dagh-dagha_)to return to\r\nobedience (_tā'ib_) in my 40th year, I was drinking to excess now that\r\nless than a year was left.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 7th_) On Sunday the 16th, having made my morning (_ṣubūḥī_) and\r\nbecame sober. Mullā Yārak played an air he had composed in five-time and\r\nin the five-line measure (_makhammas_), while I chose to eat a\r\nconfection (_ma'jūn_). He had composed an excellent air. I had not\r\noccupied myself with such things for some time; a wish to compose came\r\nover me now, so I composed an air in four-time, as will be mentioned in\r\ntime.[1533]\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 10th_) On Wednesday (19th) it was said for fun, while we\r\nwere making our morning (_ṣubūḥī_), \"Let whoever speaks like a\r\nSārt (_i.e._ in Persian) drink a cup.\" Through this many drank. At\r\n_sunnat-waqt_[1534] again, when we were sitting under the willows in the\r\nmiddle of the meadow, it was said, \"Let whoever speaks like a Turk,\r\ndrink a cup!\" Through this also numbers drank. After the sun got up, we\r\ndrank under the orange-trees on the reservoir-bank.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 11th_) Next day (20th) we got on a raft from Darūta; got off\r\nagain below Jūī-shāhī and went to Atar.\r\n\r\n(_Jan...._) We rode from there to visit Nūr-valley, went as far as Sūsān\r\n(lily)-village, then turned back and dismounted in Amla.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 250.] (_Jan. 14th_) As Khwāja Kalān had brought Bajaur\r\ninto good order, and as he was a friend of mine, I had sent for him and\r\nhad made Bajaur over to Shāh Mīr Ḥusain's charge. On Saturday the 22nd\r\nof the month (Muḥarram), Shāh Mīr Ḥusain was given leave to go. That day\r\nin Amla we drank.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 15th_) It rained (_yāmghūr yāghdūrūb_) next day (23rd).\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Kula-grām in Kūnār[1535] where Malik `Alī's house is,\r\nwe dismounted at his middle son's house, overlooking an orange-orchard.\r\nWe did not go into the orchard because of the rain but just drank where\r\nwe were. The rain was very heavy. I taught Mullā `Alī Khān a ṯalisman I\r\nknew; he wrote it on four pieces of paper and hung them on four sides;\r\nas he did it, the rain stopped and the air began to clear.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 16th_) At dawn (24th) we got on a raft; on another several braves\r\nwent. People in Bajaur, Sawād, Kūnār and thereabouts make a beer (_bīr\r\nbūza_)[1536] the ferment of which is a thing they call _kīm_.[1537] This\r\n_kīm_ they make of the roots of herbs and several simples, shaped like a\r\nloaf, dried and kept by them. Some sorts of beer are surprisingly\r\nexhilarating, but bitter and distasteful. We had thought of drinking\r\nbeer but, because of its bitter taste, preferred a confection. `Asas,\r\nḤasan _Aīkirik_,[1538] and Mastī, on the other raft, were ordered to\r\ndrink some; they did so and became quite drunk. Ḥasan _Aīkirik_ set up a\r\ndisgusting disturbance; `Asas, very drunk, did such [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n250b.] unpleasant things that we were most uncomfortable (_ba tang_). I\r\nthought of having them put off on the far side of the water, but some of\r\nthe others begged them off.\r\n\r\nI had sent for Khwāja Kalān at this time and had bestowed Bajaur on Shāh\r\nMīr Ḥusain. For why? Khwāja Kalān was a friend; his stay in Bajaur had\r\nbeen long; moreover the Bajaur appointment appeared an easy one.\r\n\r\nAt the ford of the Kūnār-water Shāh Mīr Ḥusain met me on his way to\r\nBajaur. I sent for him and said a few trenchant words, gave him some\r\nspecial armour, and let him go.\r\n\r\nOpposite Nūr-gal (Rock-village) an old man begged from those on the\r\nrafts; every-one gave him something, coat (_tūn_), turban, bathing-cloth\r\nand so on, so he took a good deal away.\r\n\r\nAt a bad place in mid-stream the raft struck with a great shock; there\r\nwas much alarm; it did not sink but Mīr Muḥammad the raftsman was thrown\r\ninto the water. We were near Atar that night.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 17th_) On Tuesday (25th) we reached Mandrāwar.[1539] Qūtlūq-qadam\r\nand his father had arranged a party inside the fort; though the place\r\nhad no charm, a few cups were drunk there to please them. We went to\r\ncamp at the Other Prayer.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 18th_) On Wednesday (26th) an excursion was made to\r\nKind-kir[1540] spring. Kind-kir is a dependent village of the Mandrāwar\r\n_tūmān_, the one and only village of the Lamghānāt [Sidenote: Fol. 251.]\r\nwhere dates are grown. It lies rather high on the mountain-skirt, its\r\ndate lands on its east side. At one edge of the date lands is the\r\nspring, in a place aside (_yān yīr_). Six or seven yards below the\r\nspring-head people have heaped up stones to make a shelter[1541] for\r\nbathing and by so-doing have raised the water in the reservoir high\r\nenough for it to pour over the heads of the bathers. The water is very\r\nsoft; it is felt a little cold in wintry days but is pleasant if one\r\nstays in it.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 19th_) On Thursday (27th) Sher Khān _Tarkalānī_ got us to\r\ndismount at his house and there gave us a feast (_ẓiyāfat_). Having\r\nridden on at the Mid-day Prayer, fish were taken out of the fish-ponds\r\nof which particulars have been given.[1542]\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 20th_) On Friday (28th) we dismounted near Khwāja Mīr-i-mīrān's\r\nvillage. A party was held there at the Evening Prayer.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 21st_) On Saturday (29th) we hunted the hill between `Alī-shang\r\nand Alangār. One hunting-circle having been made on the `Alī-shang side,\r\nanother on the Alangār, the deer were driven down off the hill and many\r\nwere killed. Returning from hunting, we dismounted in a garden belonging\r\nto the Maliks of Alangār and there had a party.\r\n\r\nHalf of one of my front-teeth had broken off, the other half remaining;\r\nthis half broke off today while I was eating food.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 22nd_) At dawn (Ṣafar 1st) we rode out and had a fishing-net\r\ncast, at mid-day went into `Alī-shang and drank in a garden.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 23rd_) Next day (Ṣafar 2nd) Ḥamza Khān, Malik of `Alī-shang was\r\nmade over to the avengers-of-blood[1543] for his evil deeds in shedding\r\ninnocent blood, and retaliation was made.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 24th_) On Tuesday, after reading a chapter of the Qorān\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 251b.] (_wird_), we turned for Kābul by the Yān-būlāgh\r\nroad. At the Other Prayer, we passed the [Bārān]-water from Aūlūgh-nūr\r\n(Great-rock); reached Qarā-tū by the Evening Prayer, there gave our\r\nhorses corn and had a hasty meal prepared, rode on again as soon as they\r\nhad finished their barley.[1544]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S NOTE ON 926 TO 932 AH.-1520 TO 1525 AD.\r\n\r\nBābur's diary breaks off here for five years and ten months.[1545] His\r\nactivities during the unrecorded period may well have left no time in\r\nwhich to keep one up, for in it he went thrice to Qandahār, thrice into\r\nIndia, once to Badakhshān, once to Balkh; twice at least he punished\r\nrefractory tribesmen; he received embassies from Hindūstān, and must\r\nhave had much to oversee in muster and equipment for his numerous\r\nexpeditions. Over and above this, he produced the _Mubīn_, a Turkī poem\r\nof 2000 lines.\r\n\r\nThat the gap in his autobiography is not intentional several passages in\r\nhis writings show;[1546] he meant to fill it; there is no evidence that\r\nhe ever did so; the reasonable explanation of his failure is that he\r\ndied before he had reached this part of his book.\r\n\r\nThe events of these unrecorded years are less interesting than those of\r\nthe preceding gap, inasmuch as their drama of human passion is simpler;\r\nit is one mainly of cross-currents of ambition, nothing in it matching\r\nthe maelstrom of sectarian hate, tribal antipathy, and racial struggle\r\nwhich engulphed Bābur's fortunes beyond the Oxus.\r\n\r\nNone-the-less the period has its distinctive mark, the biographical one\r\nset by his personality as his long-sustained effort works out towards\r\nrule in Hindūstān. He becomes felt; his surroundings bend to his\r\npurpose; his composite following accepts his goal; he gains the southern\r\nkey of Kābul and Hindūstān and presses the Arghūns out from his rear; in\r\nthe Panj-āb he becomes a power; the Rājpūt Rānā of Chitor proffers him\r\nalliance against Ibrāhīm; and his intervention is sought in those\r\nwarrings of the Afghāns which were the matrix of his own success.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a. Dramatis personae._\r\n\r\nThe following men played principal parts in the events of the\r\nunchronicled years:—\r\n\r\nBābur in Kābul, Badakhshān and Balkh,[1547] his earlier following purged\r\nof Mughūl rebellion, and augmented by the various Mīrzās-in-exile in\r\nwhose need of employment Shāh Beg saw Bābur's need of wider\r\nterritory.[1548]\r\n\r\nSulṯān Ibrāhīm _Lūdī_ who had succeeded after his father Sikandar's\r\ndeath (Sunday Ẕū'l-qa`da 7th 923 _AH._-Nov. 21st 1517 AD.)[1549], was\r\nnow embroiled in civil war, and hated for his tyranny and cruelty.\r\n\r\nShāh Ismā`īl _Ṣafawī_, ruling down to Rajab 19th 930 AH. (May 24th 1524\r\nAD.) and then succeeded by his son T̤ahmāsp _aet._ 10.\r\n\r\nKūchūm (Kūchkūnjī) Khān, Khāqān of the Aūzbegs, Shaibānī's successor,\r\nnow in possession of Transoxiana.\r\n\r\nSulṯān Sa`īd Khān _Chaghatāī_, with head-quarters in Kāshghar, a ruler\r\namongst the Mughūls but not their Khāqān, the supreme Khānship being his\r\nelder brother Manṣūr's.\r\n\r\nShāh Shujā' Beg _Arghūn_, who, during the period, at various times held\r\nQandahār, Shāl, Mustang, Sīwīstān, and part of Sind. He died in 930 AH.\r\n(1524 AD.) and was succeeded by his son Ḥasan who read the _khuṯba_ for\r\nBābur.\r\n\r\nKhān Mīrzā _Mīrānshāhī_, who held Badakhshān from Bābur, with\r\nhead-quarters in Qūndūz; he died in 927 AH. (1520 AD.) and was succeeded\r\nin his appointment by Humāyūn _aet._ 13.\r\n\r\nMuḥammad-i-zamān _Bāī-qarā_ who held Balkh perhaps direct from Bābur,\r\nperhaps from Ismā`īl through Bābur.\r\n\r\n`Alā'u'd-dīn `Ālam Khān _Lūdī_, brother of the late Sulṯān Sikandar\r\n_Lūdī_ and now desiring to supersede his nephew Ibrāhīm.\r\n\r\nDaulat Khān _Yūsuf-khail_ (as Bābur uniformly describes him), or _Lūdī_\r\n(as other writers do), holding Lāhor for Ibrāhīm _Lūdī_ at the beginning\r\nof the period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SOURCES FOR THE EVENTS OF THIS GAP_\r\n\r\nA complete history of the events the _Bābur-nāma_ leaves unrecorded has\r\nyet to be written. The best existing one, whether Oriental or European,\r\nis Erskine's _History of India_, but this does not exhaust the\r\nsources—notably not using the _Ḥabību's-siyar_—and could be revised here\r\nand there with advantage.\r\n\r\nMost of the sources enumerated as useful for filling the previous gap\r\nare so here; to them must be added, for the affairs of Qandahār,\r\nKhwānd-amīr's _Ḥabību's-siyar_. This Mīr Ma`ṣūm's _Tārīkh-i-sind_\r\nsupplements usefully, but its brevity and its discrepant dates make it\r\ndemand adjustment; in some details it is expanded by Sayyid Jamāl's\r\n_Tarkhān-_ or _Arghūn-nāma_.\r\n\r\nFor the affairs of Hindūstān the main sources are enumerated in Elliot\r\nand Dowson's _History of India_ and in Nassau Lees' _Materials for the\r\nhistory of India_. Doubtless all will be exhausted for the coming\r\n_Cambridge History of India_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_EVENTS OF THE UNCHRONICLED YEARS_\r\n\r\n926 AH.-DEC. 23RD 1519 TO DEC. 12TH 1520 AD.\r\n\r\nThe question of which were Bābur's \"Five expeditions\" into Hindūstān has\r\nbeen often discussed; it is useful therefore to establish the dates of\r\nthose known as made. I have entered one as made in this year for the\r\nfollowing reasons;—it broke short because Shāh Beg made incursion into\r\nBābur's territories, and that incursion was followed by a siege of\r\nQandahār which several matters mentioned below show to have taken place\r\nin 926 AH.\r\n\r\n_a. Expedition into Hindūstān._\r\n\r\nThe march out from Kābul may have been as soon as muster and equipment\r\nallowed after the return from Lamghān chronicled in the diary. It was\r\nmade through Bajaur where refractory tribesmen were brought to order.\r\nThe Indus will have been forded at the usual place where, until the last\r\none of 932 AH. (1525 AD.), all expeditions crossed on the outward march.\r\nBhīra was traversed in which were Bābur's own Commanders, and advance\r\nwas made, beyond lands yet occupied, to Sīālkot, 72 miles north of Lāhor\r\nand in the Rechna _dū-āb_. It was occupied without resistance; and a\r\nfurther move made to what the MSS. call Sayyidpūr; this attempted\r\ndefence, was taken by assault and put to the sword. No place named\r\nSayyidpūr is given in the Gazetteer of India, but the _Āyīn-i-akbarī_\r\nmentions a Sidhpūr which from its neighbourhood to Sīālkot may be what\r\nBābur took.\r\n\r\nNothing indicates an intention in Bābur to join battle with Ibrāhīm at\r\nthis time; Lāhor may have been his objective, after he had made a\r\ndemonstration in force to strengthen his footing in Bhīra. Whatever he\r\nmay have planned to do beyond Sidhpūr(?) was frustrated by the news\r\nwhich took him back to Kābul and thence to Qandahār, that an incursion\r\ninto his territory had been made by Shāh Beg.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Shāh Shujā` Beg's position._\r\n\r\nShāh Beg was now holding Qandahār, Shāl, Mustang and Sīwīstān.[1550] He\r\nknew that he held Qandahār by uncertain tenure, in face of its\r\ndesirability for Bābur and his own lesser power. His ground was further\r\nweakened by its usefulness for operations on Harāt and the presence with\r\nBābur of Bāī-qarā refugees, ready to seize a chance, if offered by\r\nIsmā`īl's waning fortunes, for recovery of their former seat. Knowing\r\nhis weakness, he for several years had been pushing his way out into\r\nSind by way of the Bolān-pass.\r\n\r\nHis relations with Bābur were ostensibly good; he had sent him envoys\r\ntwice last year, the first time to announce a success at Kāhān had in\r\nthe end of 924 AH. (Nov. 1519 AD.). His son Ḥasan however, with whom he\r\nwas unreconciled, had been for more than a year in Bābur's company,—a\r\nmatter not unlikely to stir under-currents of unfriendliness on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\nHis relations with Shāh Ismā`īl were deferential, in appearance even\r\nvassal-like, as is shewn by Khwānd-amīr's account of his appeal for\r\nintervention against Bābur to the Shāh's officers in Harāt. Whether he\r\nread the _khuṯba_ for any suzerain is doubtful; his son Ḥasan, it may be\r\nsaid, read it later on for Bābur.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. The impelling cause of this siege of Qandahār._\r\n\r\nPrecisely what Shāh Beg did to bring Bābur back from the Panj-āb and\r\ndown upon Qandahār is not found mentioned by any source. It seems likely\r\nto have been an affair of subordinates instigated by or for him. Its\r\nimmediate agents may have been the Nīkdīrī (Nūkdīrī) and Hazāra tribes\r\nBābur punished on his way south. Their location was the western\r\nborder-land; they may have descended on the Great North Road or have\r\nraided for food in that famine year. It seems certain that Shāh Beg made\r\nno serious attempt on Kābul; he was too much occupied in Sind to allow\r\nhim to do so. Some unused source may throw light on the matter\r\nincidentally; the offence may have been small in itself and yet\r\nsufficient to determine Bābur to remove risk from his rear.[1551]\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. Qandahār._\r\n\r\nThe Qandahār of Bābur's sieges was difficult of capture; he had not\r\ntaken it in 913 AH. (f. 208_b_) by siege or assault, but by default\r\nafter one day's fight in the open. The strength of its position can be\r\njudged from the following account of its ruins as they were seen in 1879\r\nAD., the military details of which supplement Bellew's description\r\nquoted in Appendix J.\r\n\r\nThe fortifications are of great extent with a treble line of bastioned\r\nwalls and a high citadel in the centre. The place is in complete ruin\r\nand its locality now useful only as a grazing ground.... \"The town is in\r\nthree parts, each on a separate eminence, and capable of mutual\r\ndefence. The mountain had been covered with towers united by curtains,\r\nand the one on the culminating point may be called impregnable. It\r\ncommanded the citadel which stood lower down on the second eminence, and\r\nthis in turn commanded the town which was on a table-land elevated above\r\nthe plain. The triple walls surrounding the city were at a considerable\r\ndistance from it. After exploring the citadel and ruins, we mounted by\r\nthe gorge to the summit of the hill with the impregnable fort. In this\r\ngorge are the ruins of two tanks, some 80 feet square, all destroyed,\r\nwith the pillars fallen; the work is _pukka_ in brick and _chunām_\r\n(cement) and each tank had been domed in; they would have held about\r\n400,000 gallons each.\" (Le Messurier's _Kandahar in 1879 AD._ pp. 223,\r\n245.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. Bābur's sieges of Qandahār._\r\n\r\nThe term of five years is found associated with Bābur's sieges of\r\nQandahār, sometimes suggesting a single attempt of five years' duration.\r\nThis it is easy to show incorrect; its root may be Mīr Ma`ṣūm's\r\nerroneous chronology.\r\n\r\nThe day on which the keys of Qandahār were made over to Bābur is known,\r\nfrom the famous inscription which commemorates the event (Appendix J),\r\nas Shawwāl 13th 928 AH. Working backwards from this, it is known that in\r\n927 AH. terms of surrender were made and that Bābur went back to Kābul;\r\nhe is besieging it in 926 AH.—the year under description; his annals of\r\n925 AH. are complete and contain no siege; the year 924 AH. appears to\r\nhave had no siege, Shāh Beg was on the Indus and his son was for at\r\nleast part of it with Bābur; 923 AH. was a year of intended siege,\r\nfrustrated by Bābur's own illness; of any siege in 922 AH. there is as\r\nyet no record known. So that it is certain there was no unremitted\r\nbeleaguerment through five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_f. The siege of 926 AH. (1520 AD.)._\r\n\r\nWhen Bābur sat down to lay regular siege to Qandahār, with mining and\r\nbattering of the walls,[1552] famine was desolating the country round.\r\nThe garrison was reduced to great distress; \"pestilence,\" ever an ally\r\nof Qandahār, broke out within the walls, spread to Bābur's camp, and in\r\nthe month of Tīr (June) led him to return to Kābul.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding months of respite, Shāh Beg pushed on in Sind and his\r\nformer slave, now commander, Mehtar Saṃbhal revictualled the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n927 AH.—DEC. 12TH 1520 TO DEC. 1ST 1521 AD.\r\n\r\n_a. The manuscript sources._\r\n\r\nTwo accounts of the sieges of Qandahār in this and next year are\r\navailable, one in Khwānd-amīr's _Ḥabību's-siyar_, the other in Ma`ṣūm\r\n_Bhakkarī's Tārīkh-i-sind_. As they have important differences, it is\r\nnecessary to consider the opportunities of their authors for\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nKhwānd-amīr finished his history in 1524-29 AD. His account of these\r\naffairs of Qandahār is contemporary; he was in close touch with several\r\nof the actors in them and may have been in Harāt through their course;\r\none of his patrons, Amīr Ghiyāṣu'd-dīn, was put to death in this year in\r\nHarāt because of suspicion that he was an ally of Bābur; his nephew,\r\nanother Ghiyāṣu'd-dīn was in Qandahār, the bearer next year of its keys\r\nto Bābur; moreover he was with Bābur himself a few years later in\r\nHindūstān.\r\n\r\nMīr Ma`ṣūm wrote in 1600 AD. 70 to 75 years after Khwānd-amīr. Of these\r\nsieges he tells what may have been traditional and mentions no\r\nmanuscript authorities. Blochmann's biography of him (_Āyīn-i-akbarī_ p.\r\n514) shews his ample opportunity of learning orally what had happened in\r\nthe Arghūn invasion of Sind, but does not mention the opportunity for\r\nhearing traditions about Qandahār which his term of office there allowed\r\nhim. During that term it was that he added an inscription, commemorative\r\nof Akbar's dominion, to Bābur's own at Chihil-zīna, which records the\r\ndate of the capture of Qandahār (928 AH.-1522 AD.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. The Ḥabību's-siyar account_ (lith. ed. iii, part 4, p. 97).\r\n\r\nKhwānd-amīr's contemporary narrative allows Ma`ṣūm's to dovetail into it\r\nas to some matters, but contradicts it in the important ones of date,\r\nand mode of surrender by Shāh Beg to Bābur. It states that Bābur was\r\nresolved in 926 AH. (1520 AD.) to uproot Shāh Shujā` Beg from Qandahār,\r\nled an army against the place, and \"opened the Gates of war\". It gives\r\nno account of the siege of 926 AH. but passes on to the occurrences of\r\n927 AH. (1521 AD.) when Shāh Beg, unable to meet Bābur in the field,\r\nshut himself up in the town and strengthened the defences. Bābur put his\r\nutmost pressure on the besieged, \"often riding his piebald horse close\r\nto the moat and urging his men to fiery onset.\" The garrison resisted\r\nmanfully, breaching the \"life-fortresses\" of the Kābulīs with sword,\r\narrow, spear and death-dealing stone, but Bābur's heroes were most often\r\nvictorious, and drove their assailants back through the Gates.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Death of Khān Mīrzā reported to Bābur._\r\n\r\nMeantime, continues Khwānd-amīr, Khān Mīrzā had died in Badakhshān; the\r\nnews was brought to Bābur and caused him great grief; he appointed\r\nHumāyūn to succeed the Mīrzā while he himself prosecuted the siege of\r\nQandahār and the conquest of the Garm-sīr.[1553]\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. Negociations with Bābur._\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Harāt at this time was Shāh Ismā`īl's son T̤ahmāsp,\r\nbetween six and seven years old. His guardian Amīr Khān took chief part\r\nin the diplomatic intervention with Bābur, but associated with him was\r\nAmīr Ghiyāṣu'd-dīn—the patron of Khwānd-amīr already mentioned—until put\r\nto death as an ally of Bābur. The discussion had with Bābur reveals a\r\ncomplexity of motives demanding attention. Nominally undertaken though\r\nintervention was on behalf of Shāh Beg, and certainly so at his request,\r\nthe Persian officers seem to have been less anxious on his account than\r\nfor their own position in Khurāsān, their master's position at the time\r\nbeing weakened by ill-success against the Sulṯān of Rūm. To Bābur, Shāh\r\nBeg is written of as though he were an insubordinate vassal whom Bābur\r\nwas reducing to order for the Shāh, but when Amīr Khān heard that Shāh\r\nBeg was hard pressed, he was much distressed because he feared a\r\nvictorious Bābur might move on Khurāsān. Nothing indicates however that\r\nBābur had Khurāsān in his thoughts; Hindūstān was his objective, and\r\nQandahār a help on the way; but as Amīr Khān had this fear about him, a\r\nprobable ground for it is provided by the presence with Bābur of\r\nBāī-qarā exiles whose ambition it must have been to recover their former\r\nseat. Whether for Harāt, Kābul, or Hindūstān, Qandahār was strength.\r\nAnother matter not fitting the avowed purpose of the diplomatic\r\nintervention is the death of Ghiyāṣu'd-dīn because an ally of Bābur;\r\nthis makes Amīr Khān seem to count Bābur as Ismā`īl's enemy.\r\n\r\nShāh Beg's requests for intervention began in 926 AH. (1520 AD.), as\r\nalso did the remonstrance of the Persian officers with Bābur; his\r\ncouriers followed one another with entreaty that the Amīrs would\r\ncontrive for Bābur to retire, with promise of obeisance and of yearly\r\ntribute. The Amīrs set forth to Bābur that though Shāh Shujā` Beg had\r\noffended and had been deserving of wrath and chastisement, yet, as he\r\nwas penitent and had promised loyalty and tribute, it was now proper for\r\nBābur to raise the siege (of 926 AH.) and go back to Kābul. To this\r\nBābur answered that Shāh Beg's promise was a vain thing, on which no\r\nreliance could be placed; please God!, said he, he himself would take\r\nQandahār and send Shāh Beg a prisoner to Harāt; and that he should be\r\nready then to give the keys of the town and the possession of the\r\nGarm-sīr to any-one appointed to receive them.\r\n\r\nThis correspondence suits an assumption that Bābur acted for Shāh\r\nIsmā`īl, a diplomatic assumption merely, the verbal veil, on one side,\r\nfor anxiety lest Bābur or those with him should attack Harāt,—on the\r\nother, for Bābur's resolve to hold Qandahār himself.\r\n\r\nAmīr Khān was not satisfied with Bābur's answer, but had his attention\r\ndistracted by another matter, presumably `Ubaidu'l-lāh Khān's attack on\r\nHarāt in the spring of the year (March-April 1521 AD.). Negociations\r\nappear to have been resumed later, since Khwānd-amīr claims it as their\r\nresult that Bābur left Qandahār this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. The Tārīkh-i-sind account._\r\n\r\nMīr Ma`ṣūm is very brief; he says that in this year (his 922 AH.), Bābur\r\nwent down to Qandahār before the year's tribute in grain had been\r\ncollected, destroyed the standing crops, encompassed the town, and\r\nreduced it to extremity; that Shāh Beg, wearied under reiterated attack\r\nand pre-occupied by operations in Sind, proposed terms, and that these\r\nwere made with stipulation for the town to be his during one year more\r\nand then to be given over to Bābur. These terms settled, Bābur went to\r\nKābul, Shāh Beg to Sīwī.\r\n\r\nThe Arghūn families were removed to Shāl and Sīwī, so that the year's\r\ndelay may have been an accommodation allowed for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_f. Concerning dates._\r\n\r\nThere is much discrepancy between the dates of the two historians.\r\nKhwānd-amīr's agree with the few fixed ones of the period and with the\r\ncourse of events; several of Ma`ṣūm's, on the contrary, are _seriatim_\r\nfive (lunar) years earlier. For instance, events Khwānd-amīr places\r\nunder 927 AH. Ma`ṣūm places under 922 AH. Again, while Ma`ṣūm correctly\r\ngives 913 AH. (1507 AD.) as the year of Bābur's first capture of\r\nQandahār, he sets up a discrepant series later, from the success Shāh\r\nBeg had at Kāhān; this he allots to 921 AH. (1515 AD.) whereas Bābur\r\nreceived news of it (f. 233_b_) in the beginning of 925 AH. (1519 AD.).\r\nAgain, Ma`ṣūm makes Shāh Ḥasan go to Bābur in 921 AH. and stay two\r\nyears; but Ḥasan spent the whole of 925 AH. with Bābur and is not\r\nmentioned as having left before the second month of 926 AH. Again,\r\nMa`ṣūm makes Shāh Beg surrender the keys of Qandahār in 923 AH. (1517\r\nAD.), but 928 AH. (1522 AD.) is shewn by Khwānd-amīr's dates and\r\nnarrative, and is inscribed at Chihil-zīna.[1554]\r\n\r\n\r\n928 AH.-DEC. 1ST 1521 TO NOV. 20TH 1522 AD.\r\n\r\n_a. Bābur visits Badakhshān._\r\n\r\nEither early in this year or late in the previous one, Bābur and Māhīm\r\nwent to visit Humāyūn in his government, probably to Faizābād, and\r\nstayed with him what Gul-badan calls a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Expedition to Qandahār._\r\n\r\nThis year saw the end of the duel for possession of Qandahār.\r\nKhwānd-amīr's account of its surrender differs widely from Ma`ṣūm's. It\r\nclaims that Bābur's retirement in 927 AH. was due to the remonstrances\r\nfrom Harāt, and that Shāh Beg, worn out by the siege, relied on the\r\narrangement the Amīrs had made with Bābur and went to Sīwī, leaving one\r\n`Abdu'l-bāqī in charge of the place. This man, says Khwānd-amīr, drew\r\nthe line of obliteration over his duty to his master, sent to Bābur,\r\nbrought him down to Qandahār, and gave him the keys of the town—by the\r\nhand of Khwānd-amīr's nephew Ghiyāṣu'd-dīn, specifies the\r\n_Tarkhān-nāma_. In this year messengers had come and gone between Bābur\r\nand Harāt; two men employed by Amīr Khān are mentioned by name; of them\r\nthe last had not returned to Harāt when a courier of Bābur's, bringing a\r\ntributary gift, announced there that the town was in his master's hands.\r\nKhwānd-amīr thus fixes the year 928 AH. as that in which the town passed\r\ninto Bābur's hands; this date is confirmed by the one inscribed in the\r\nmonument of victory at Chihil-zīna which Bābur ordered excavated on the\r\nnaze of the limestone ridge behind the town. The date there given is\r\nShawwāl 13th 928 AH. (Sep. 6th 1522 AD.).\r\n\r\nMa`ṣūm's account, dated 923 AH. (1517 AD.), is of the briefest:—Shāh Beg\r\nfulfilled his promise, much to Bābur's approval, by sending him the keys\r\nof the town and royal residence.\r\n\r\nAlthough Khwānd-amīr's account has good claim to be accepted, it must be\r\nadmitted that several circumstances can be taken to show that Shāh Beg\r\nhad abandoned Qandahār, _e.g._ the removal of the families after Bābur's\r\nretirement last year, and his own absence in a remote part of Sind this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. The year of Shāh Beg's death._\r\n\r\nOf several variant years assigned for the death of Shāh Beg in the\r\nsources, two only need consideration.[1555] There is consensus of\r\nopinion about the month and close agreement about the day, Sha`bān 22nd\r\nor 23rd. Ma`ṣūm gives a chronogram, _Shahr-Sha`bān_, (month of Sha`bān)\r\nwhich yields 928, but he does not mention where he obtained it, nor does\r\nanything in his narrative shew what has fixed the day of the month.\r\n\r\nTwo objections to 928 are patent: (1) the doubt engendered by Ma`ṣūm's\r\nearlier ante-dating; (2) that if 928 be right, Shāh Beg was already dead\r\nover two months when Qandahār was surrendered. This he might have been\r\naccording to Khwānd-amīr's narrative, but if he died on Sha`bān 22nd 928\r\n(July 26th 1522), there was time for the news to have reached Qandahār,\r\nand to have gone on to Harāt before the surrender. Shāh Beg's death at\r\nthat time could not have failed to be associated in Khwānd-amīr's\r\nnarrative with the fate of Qandahār; it might have pleaded some excuse\r\nwith him for `Abdu'l-bāqī, who might even have had orders from Shāh\r\nḤasan to make the town over to Bābur whose suzerainty he had\r\nacknowledged at once on succession by reading the _khuṯba_ in his name.\r\nKhwānd-amīr however does not mention what would have been a salient\r\npoint in the events of the siege; his silence cannot but weigh against\r\nthe 928 AH.\r\n\r\nThe year 930 AH. is given by Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad's _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_\r\n(lith. ed. p. 637), and this year has been adopted by Erskine, Beale,\r\nand Ney Elias, perhaps by others. Some light on the matter may be\r\nobtained incidentally as the sources are examined for a complete history\r\nof India, perhaps coming from the affairs of Multān, which was attacked\r\nby Shāh Ḥasan after communication with Bābur.\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. Bābur's literary work in 928 AH. and earlier._\r\n\r\n1. The _Mubīn_. This year, as is known from a chronogram within the\r\nwork, Bābur wrote the Turkī poem of 2000 lines to which Abū'l-faẓl and\r\nBadāyūnī give the name _Mubīn_ (The Exposition), but of which the true\r\ntitle is said by the _Nafā'isu'l-ma`āsir_ to be _Dar fiqa mubaiyan_ (The\r\nLaw expounded). Sprenger found it called also _Fiqa-i-bāburī_ (Bābur's\r\nLaw). It is a versified and highly orthodox treatise on Muḥammadan Law,\r\nwritten for the instruction of Kāmrān. A Commentary on it, called also\r\n_Mubīn_, was written by Shaikh Zain. Bābur quotes from it (f. 351_b_)\r\nwhen writing of linear measures. Berézine found and published a large\r\nportion of it as part of his _Chrestomathie Turque_ (Kazan 1857); the\r\nsame fragment may be what was published by Ilminsky. Teufel remarks that\r\nthe MS. used by Berézine may have descended direct from one sent by\r\nBābur to a distinguished legist of Transoxiana, because the last words\r\nof Berézine's imprint are Bābur's _Begleitschreiben_ (_envoi_); he adds\r\nthe expectation that the legist's name might be learned. Perhaps this\r\nrecipient was the Khwāja Kalān, son of Khwāja Yaḥya, a Samarkandī to\r\nwhom Bābur sent a copy of his Memoirs on March 7th 1520 (935 AH. f.\r\n363).[1556]\r\n\r\n2. The _Bābur-nāma_ diary of 925-6 AH. (1519-20 AD.). This is almost\r\ncontemporary with the _Mubīn_ and is the earliest part of the\r\n_Bābur-nāma_ writings now known. It was written about a decade earlier\r\nthan the narrative of 899 to 914 AH. (1494 to 1507 AD.), carries later\r\nannotations, and has now the character of a draft awaiting revision.\r\n\r\n3. A _Dīwān_ (Collection of poems). By dovetailing a few fragments of\r\ninformation, it becomes clear that by 925 AH. (1519 AD.) Bābur had made\r\na Collection of poetical compositions distinct from the Rāmpūr _Dīwān_;\r\nit is what he sent to Pūlād Sulṯan in 925 AH. (f. 238). Its date\r\nexcludes the greater part of the Rāmpūr one. It may have contained those\r\nverses to which my husband drew attention in the Asiatic Quarterly\r\nReview of 1911, as quoted in the _Abūshqa_; and it may have contained,\r\nin agreement with its earlier date, the verses Bābur quotes as written\r\nin his earlier years. None of the quatrains found in the _Abūshqa_ and\r\nthere attributed to \"Bābur Mīrzā\", are in the Rāmpūr _Dīwān_; nor are\r\nseveral of those early ones of the _Bābur-nāma_. So that the Dīwān sent\r\nto Pūlād Sulṯān may be the source from which the _Abūshqa_ drew its\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nOn first examining these verses, doubt arose as to whether they were\r\nreally by Bābur _Mīrānshāhī_; or whether they were by \"Bābur Mīrzā\"\r\n_Shāhrukhī_. Fortunately my husband lighted on one of them quoted in the\r\n_Sanglakh_ and there attributed to Bābur Pādshāh. The _Abūshqa_\r\nquatrains are used as examples in de Courteille's _Dictionary_, but\r\nwithout an author's name; they can be traced there through my husband's\r\narticles.[1557]\r\n\r\n\r\n929 AH.—NOV. 20TH 1522 TO NOV. 10TH 1523 AD.\r\n\r\n_a. Affairs of Hindūstān._\r\n\r\nThe centre of interest in Bābur's affairs now moves from Qandahār to a\r\nHindūstān torn by faction, of which faction one result was an appeal\r\nmade at this time to Bābur by Daulat Khān _Lūdī_ (_Yūsuf-khail_) and\r\n`Alāu'd-dīn `Ālam Khān _Lūdī_ for help against Ibrāhīm.[1558]\r\n\r\nThe following details are taken mostly from Aḥmad Yādgār's\r\n_Tārīkh-i-salāṯīn-i-afāghana_[1559]:—Daulat Khān had been summoned to\r\nIbrāhīm's presence; he had been afraid to go and had sent his son\r\nDilāwar in his place; his disobedience angering Ibrāhīm, Dilāwar had a\r\nbad reception and was shewn a ghastly exhibit of disobedient commanders.\r\nFearing a like fate for himself, he made escape and hastened to report\r\nmatters to his father in Lāhor. His information strengthening Daulat\r\nKhān's previous apprehensions, decided the latter to proffer allegiance\r\nto Bābur and to ask his help against Ibrāhīm. Apparently `Ālam Khān's\r\ninterests were a part of this request. Accordingly Dilāwar (or Apāq)\r\nKhān went to Kābul, charged with his father's message, and with intent\r\nto make known to Bābur Ibrāhīm's evil disposition, his cruelty and\r\ntyranny, with their fruit of discontent amongst his Commanders and\r\nsoldiery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Reception of Dilāwar Khān in Kābul._\r\n\r\nWedding festivities were in progress[1560] when Dilāwar Khān reached\r\nKābul. He presented himself, at the Chār-bāgh may be inferred, and had\r\nword taken to Bābur that an Afghān was at his Gate with a petition. When\r\nadmitted, he demeaned himself as a suppliant and proceeded to set forth\r\nthe distress of Hindūstān. Bābur asked why he, whose family had so long\r\neaten the salt of the Lūdīs, had so suddenly deserted them for himself.\r\nDilāwar answered that his family through 40 years had upheld the Lūdī\r\nthrone, but that Ibrāhīm maltreated Sikandar's amīrs, had killed 25 of\r\nthem without cause, some by hanging some burned alive, and that there\r\nwas no hope of safety in him. Therefore, he said, he had been sent by\r\nmany amīrs to Bābur whom they were ready to obey and for whose coming\r\nthey were on the anxious watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Bābur asks a sign._\r\n\r\nAt the dawn of the day following the feast, Bābur prayed in the garden\r\nfor a sign of victory in Hindūstān, asking that it should be a gift to\r\nhimself of mango or betel, fruits of that land. It so happened that\r\nDaulat Khān had sent him, as a present, half-ripened mangoes preserved\r\nin honey; when these were set before him, he accepted them as the sign,\r\nand from that time forth, says the chronicler, made preparation for a\r\nmove on Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. `Ālam Khān._\r\n\r\nAlthough `Ālam Khān seems to have had some amount of support for his\r\nattempt against his nephew, events show he had none valid for his\r\npurpose. That he had not Daulat Khān's, later occurrences make clear.\r\nMoreover he seems not to have been a man to win adherence or to be\r\naccepted as a trustworthy and sensible leader.[1561] Dates are uncertain\r\nin the absence of Bābur's narrative, but it may have been in this year\r\nthat `Ālam Khān went in person to Kābul and there was promised help\r\nagainst Ibrāhīm.\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. Birth of Gul-badan._\r\n\r\nEither in this year or the next was born Dil-dār's third daughter\r\nGul-badan, the later author of an _Humāyūn-nāma_ written at her nephew\r\nAkbar's command in order to provide information for the _Akbar-nāma_.\r\n\r\n\r\n930 AH.—NOV. 10TH 1523 TO OCT. 29TH 1524 AD.\r\n\r\n_a. Bābur's fourth expedition to Hindūstān._\r\n\r\nThis expedition differs from all earlier ones by its co-operation with\r\nAfghān malcontents against Ibrāhīm _Lūdī_, and by having for its\r\ndeclared purpose direct attack on him through reinforcement of `Ālam\r\nKhān.\r\n\r\nExactly when the start from Kābul was made is not found stated; the\r\nroute taken after fording the Indus, was by the sub-montane road through\r\nthe Kakar country; the Jīhlam and Chīn-āb were crossed and a move was\r\nmade to within 10 miles of Lāhor.\r\n\r\nLāhor was Daulat Khān's head-quarters but he was not in it now; he had\r\nfled for refuge to a colony of Bilūchīs, perhaps towards Multān, on the\r\napproach against him of an army of Ibrāhīm's under Bihār Khān _Lūdī_. A\r\nbattle ensued between Bābur and Bihār Khān; the latter was defeated with\r\ngreat slaughter; Bābur's troops followed his fugitive men into Lāhor,\r\nplundered the town and burned some of the _bāzārs_.\r\n\r\nFour days were spent near Lāhor, then move south was made to Dībālpūr\r\nwhich was stormed, plundered and put to the sword. The date of this\r\ncapture is known from an incidental remark of Bābur about chronograms\r\n(f. 325), to be mid-Rabī`u'l-awwal 930 AH. (_circa_ Jan. 22nd 1524\r\nAD.).[1562] From Dībālpūr a start was made for Sihrind but before this\r\ncould be reached news arrived which dictated return to Lāhor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. The cause of return._\r\n\r\nDaulat Khān's action is the obvious cause of the retirement. He and his\r\nsons had not joined Bābur until the latter was at Dībālpūr; he was not\r\nrestored to his former place in charge of the important Lāhor, but was\r\ngiven Jalandhar and Sulṯānpūr, a town of his own foundation. This\r\nangered him extremely but he seems to have concealed his feelings for\r\nthe time and to have given Bābur counsel as if he were content. His son\r\nDilāwar, however, represented to Bābur that his father's advice was\r\ntreacherous; it concerned a move to Multān, from which place Daulat Khān\r\nmay have come up to Dībālpūr and connected with which at this time,\r\nsomething is recorded of co-operation by Bābur and Shāh Ḥasan _Arghūn_.\r\nBut the incident is not yet found clearly described by a source. Dilāwar\r\nKhān told Bābur that his father's object was to divide and thus weaken\r\nthe invading force, and as this would have been the result of taking\r\nDaulat Khān's advice, Bābur arrested him and Apāq on suspicion of\r\ntreacherous intent. They were soon released, and Sulṯānpūr was given\r\nthem, but they fled to the hills, there to await a chance to swoop on\r\nthe Panj-āb. Daulat Khān's hostility and his non-fulfilment of his\r\nengagement with Bābur placing danger in the rear of an eastward advance,\r\nthe Panj-āb was garrisoned by Bābur's own followers and he himself went\r\nback to Kābul.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from what followed that Daulat Khān commanded much\r\nstrength in the Panj-āb; evident also that something counselled delay in\r\nthe attack on Ibrāhīm, perhaps closer cohesion in favour of `Ālam Khān,\r\ncertainly removal of the menace of Daulat Khān in the rear; there may\r\nhave been news already of the approach of the Aūzbegs on Balkh which\r\ntook Bābur next year across Hindū-kush.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. The Panj-āb garrison._\r\n\r\nThe expedition had extended Bābur's command considerably, notably by\r\nobtaining possession of Lāhor. He now posted in it Mīr `Abdu'l-`azīz his\r\nMaster of the Horse; in Dībālpūr he posted, with `Ālam Khān, Bābā Qashqa\r\n_Mughūl_; in Sīālkot, Khusrau Kūkūldāsh, in Kalanūr, Muḥammad `Alī\r\n_Tājik_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. Two deaths._\r\n\r\nThis year, on Rajab 19th (May 23rd) died Ismā`īl _Ṣafawī_ at the age of\r\n38, broken by defeat from Sulṯān Salīm of Rūm.[1563] He was succeeded by\r\nhis son T̤ahmāsp, a child of ten.\r\n\r\nThis year may be that of the death of Shāh Shujā` _Arghūn_,[1564] on\r\nSha`bān 22nd (July 18th), the last grief of his burden being the death\r\nof his foster-brother Fāẓil concerning which, as well as Shāh Beg's own\r\ndeath, Mīr Ma`ṣūm's account is worthy of full reproduction. Shāh Beg was\r\nsucceeded in Sind by his son Ḥasan, who read the _khuṯba_ for Bābur and\r\ndrew closer links with Bābur's circle by marrying, either this year or\r\nthe next, Khalīfa's daughter Gul-barg, with whom betrothal had been made\r\nduring Ḥasan's visit to Bābur in Kābul. Moreover Khalīfa's son\r\nMuḥibb-i-`alī married Nāhīd the daughter of Qāsim Kūkūldāsh and\r\nMāh-chūchūk _Arghūn_ (f. 214_b_). These alliances were made, says\r\nMa`ṣūm, to strengthen Ḥasan's position at Bābur's Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. A garden detail._\r\n\r\nIn this year and presumably on his return from the Panj-āb, Bābur, as he\r\nhimself chronicles (f. 132), had plantains (bananas) brought from\r\nHindūstān for the Bāgh-i-wafā at Adīnapūr.\r\n\r\n\r\n931 AH.—OCT. 29TH 1524 TO OCT. 18TH 1525 AD.\r\n\r\n_a. Daulat Khān._\r\n\r\nDaulat Khān's power in the Panj-āb is shewn by what he effected after\r\ndispossessed of Lāhor. On Bābur's return to Kābul, he came down from the\r\nhills with a small body of his immediate followers, seized his son\r\nDilāwar, took Sulṯānpūr, gathered a large force and defeated `Ālam Khān\r\nin Dībālpūr. He detached 5000 men against Sīālkot but Bābur's begs of\r\nLāhor attacked and overcame them. Ibrāhīm sent an army to reconquer the\r\nPanj-āb; Daulat Khān, profiting by its dissensions and discontents, won\r\nover a part to himself and saw the rest break up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. `Ālam Khān._\r\n\r\nFrom his reverse at Dībālpūr, `Ālam Khān fled straight to Kābul. The\r\nfurther help he asked was promised under the condition that while he\r\nshould take Ibrāhīm's place on the throne of Dihlī, Bābur in full\r\nsuzerainty should hold Lāhor and all to the west of it. This arranged,\r\n`Ālam Khān was furnished with a body of troops, given a royal letter to\r\nthe Lāhor begs ordering them to assist him, and started off, Bābur\r\npromising to follow swiftly.\r\n\r\n`Ālam Khān's subsequent proceedings are told by Bābur in the annals of\r\n932 AH. (1525 AD.) at the time he received details about them (f.\r\n255_b_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Bābur called to Balkh._\r\n\r\nAll we have yet found about this affair is what Bābur says in\r\nexplanation of his failure to follow `Ālam Khān as promised (f. 256),\r\nnamely, that he had to go to Balkh because all the Aūzbeg Sulṯāns and\r\nKhāns had laid siege to it. Light on the affair may come from some\r\nPersian or Aūzbeg chronicle; Bābur's arrival raised the siege; and risk\r\nmust have been removed, for Bābur returned to Kābul in time to set out\r\nfor his fifth and last expedition to Hindūstān on the first day of the\r\nsecond month of next year (932 AH. 1525). A considerable body of troops\r\nwas in Badakhshān with Humāyūn; their non-arrival next year delaying his\r\nfather's progress, brought blame on himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Babur's Grave.\r\n\r\n  _To face p. 445._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEMOIRS OF BĀBUR\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III. HINDŪSTĀN\r\n\r\n\r\n932 AH.-OCT. 18TH 1525 TO OCT. 8TH 1526 AD.[1565]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Fifth expedition into Hindūstān._)\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 17th_) On Friday the 1st of the month of Ṣafar at the [Sidenote:\r\nḤaidarābād MS. Fol. 251b.] date 932, the Sun being in the Sign of the\r\nArcher, we set out for Hindūstān, crossed the small rise of Yak-langa,\r\nand dismounted in the meadow to the west of the water of\r\nDih-i-ya`qūb.[1566] `Abdu'l-malūk the armourer came into this camp; he\r\nhad gone seven or eight months earlier as my envoy to Sulṯān Sa`īd Khān\r\n(in Kāshghar), and now brought one of the Khān's men, styled Yāngī Beg\r\n(new beg) Kūkūldāsh who conveyed letters, and small presents, and\r\nverbal messages[1567] from the Khānīms and the Khān.[1568]\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 18th to 21st_) After staying two days in that camp for the\r\nconvenience of the army,[1569] we marched on, halted one night,[1570]\r\nand next dismounted at Bādām-chashma. There we ate a confection\r\n(_ma`jūn_).\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 22nd_) On Wednesday (Ṣafar 6th), when we had dismounted at\r\nBārīk-āb, the younger brethren of Nūr Beg—he himself remaining in\r\nHindūstān—brought gold _ashrafīs_ and _tankas_[1571] to the value of\r\n20,000 _shāhrukhīs_, sent from the Lāhor revenues by Khwāja Ḥusain. The\r\ngreater part of these moneys was despatched by Mullā Aḥmad, one of the\r\nchief men of Balkh, for the benefit of Balkh.[1572]\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 24th_) On Friday the 8th of the month (Ṣafar), after [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 252.] dismounting at Gandamak, I had a violent discharge;[1573] by\r\nGod's mercy, it passed off easily.\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 25th_) On Saturday we dismounted in the Bāgh-i-wafā. We delayed\r\nthere a few days, waiting for Humāyūn and the army from that side.[1574]\r\nMore than once in this history the bounds and extent, charm and delight\r\nof that garden have been described; it is most beautifully placed; who\r\nsees it with the buyer's eye will know the sort of place it is. During\r\nthe short time we were there, most people drank on drinking-days[1575]\r\nand took their morning; on non-drinking days there were parties for\r\n_ma`jūn_.\r\n\r\nI wrote harsh letters to Humāyūn, lecturing him severely because of his\r\nlong delay beyond the time fixed for him to join me.[1576]\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 3rd_) On Sunday the 17th of Ṣafar, after the morning had been\r\ntaken, Humāyūn arrived. I spoke very severely to him at once. Khwāja\r\nKalān also arrived to-day, coming up from Ghaznī. We marched in the\r\nevening of that same Sunday, and dismounted in a new garden between\r\nSulṯānpur and Khwāja Rustam.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 6th_) Marching on Wednesday (Ṣafar 20th), we got on a raft, and,\r\ndrinking as we went reached Qūsh-guṃbaz,[1577] there landed and joined\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 7th_) Starting off the camp at dawn, we ourselves went on a raft,\r\nand there ate confection (_ma`jūn_). Our encamping-ground was always\r\nQīrīq-ārīq, but not a sign or trace of the camp could [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n252b.] be seen when we got opposite it, nor any appearance of our\r\nhorses. Thought I, \"Garm-chashma (Hot-spring) is close by; they may have\r\ndismounted there.\" So saying, we went on from Qīrīq-ārīq. By the time we\r\nreached Garm-chashma, the very day was late;[1578] we did not stop\r\nthere, but going on in its lateness (_kīchīsī_), had the raft tied up\r\nsomewhere, and slept awhile.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 8th_) At day-break we landed at Yada-bīr where, as the day wore\r\non, the army-folks began to come in. The camp must have been at\r\nQīrīq-ārīq, but out of our sight.\r\n\r\nThere were several verse-makers on the raft, such as Shaikh\r\nAbū'l-wajd,[1579] Shaikh Zain, Mullā `Alī-jān, Tardī Beg _Khāksār_ and\r\nothers. In this company was quoted the following couplet of Muḥammad\r\nṢāliḥ:—[1580]\r\n\r\n   (Persian) With thee, arch coquette, for a sweetheart, what can man do?\r\n             With another than thou where thou art, what can man do?\r\n\r\nSaid I, \"Compose on these lines\";[1581] whereupon those given to\r\nversifying, did so. As jokes were always being made at the expense of\r\nMullā `Alī-jān, this couplet came off-hand into my head:—\r\n\r\n   (Persian) With one all bewildered as thou, what can man do?\r\n             .    .    .    .    .    .     , what can man do?[1582]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Mention of the Mubīn._[1583])\r\n\r\nFrom time to time before it,[1584] whatever came into my head, of good\r\nor bad, grave or jest, used to be strung into verse and written down,\r\nhowever empty and harsh the verse might be, but while I was composing\r\nthe _Mubīn_, this thought pierced through my dull wits and made way into\r\nmy troubled heart, \"A pity it [Sidenote: Fol. 253.] will be if the\r\ntongue which has treasure of utterances so lofty as these are, waste\r\nitself again on low words; sad will it be if again vile imaginings find\r\nway into the mind that has made exposition of these sublime\r\nrealities.\"[1585] Since that time I had refrained from satirical and\r\njesting verse; I was repentant (_ta'īb_); but these matters were totally\r\nout of mind and remembrance when I made that couplet (on Mullā\r\n`Alī-jān).[1586] A few days later in Bīgrām when I had fever and\r\ndischarge, followed by cough, and I began to spit blood each time I\r\ncoughed, I knew whence my reproof came; I knew what act of mine had\r\nbrought this affliction on me.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever shall violate his oath, will violate it to the hurt of his own\r\nsoul; but whoever shall perform that which he hath covenanted with God,\r\nto that man surely will He give great reward\" (_Qorān_ cap. 48 v. 10).\r\n\r\n   (_Turkī_)    What is it I do with thee, ah! my tongue?\r\n                My entrails bleed as a reckoning for thee.\r\n                Good once[1587] as thy words were, has followed\r\n                  this verse\r\n                Jesting, empty,[1588] obscene, has followed a lie.\r\n                If thou say, \"Burn will I not!\" by keeping this vow\r\n                Thou turnest thy rein from this field of strife.[1589]\r\n\r\n\"O Lord! we have dealt unjustly with our own souls; if Thou forgive us\r\nnot, and be not merciful unto us, we shall surely be of those that\r\nperish\"[1590] (_Qorān_ cap. 7 v. 22).\r\n\r\nTaking anew the place of the penitent pleading for pardon, I gave my\r\nmind rest[1591] from such empty thinking and such unlawful occupation. I\r\nbroke my pen. Made by that Court, such reproof of sinful slaves is for\r\ntheir felicity; happy are the highest and the slave when such reproof\r\nbrings warning and its profitable fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Narrative resumed._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 8th continued_) Marching on that evening, we dismounted at\r\n`Alī-masjid. The ground here being very confined, I always [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 253b.] used to dismount on a rise overlooking the camp in the\r\nvalley-bottom.[1592] The camp-fires made a wonderful illumination there\r\nat night; assuredly it was because of this that there had always been\r\ndrinking there, and was so now.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 9th and 10th_) To-day I rode out before dawn; I preferred a\r\nconfection (_ma`jūn_)[1593] and also kept this day a fast. We dismounted\r\nnear Bīgrām (Peshāwar); and next morning, the camp remaining on that\r\nsame ground, rode to Karg-awī.[1594] We crossed the Siyāh-āb in front of\r\nBīgrām, and formed our hunting-circle looking down-stream. After a\r\nlittle, a person brought word that there was a rhino in a bit of jungle\r\nnear Bīgrām, and that people had been stationed near-about it. We betook\r\nourselves, loose rein, to the place, formed a ring round the jungle,\r\nmade a noise, and brought the rhino out, when it took its way across the\r\nplain. Humāyūn and those come with him from that side (Tramontana), who\r\nhad never seen one before, were much entertained. It was pursued for two\r\nmiles; many arrows were shot at it; it was brought down without having\r\nmade a good set at man or horse. Two others were killed. I had often\r\nwondered how a rhino and an elephant would behave if brought face to\r\nface; this time one came out right in front of some elephants the\r\nmahauts were bringing along; it did not face them [Sidenote: Fol. 254.]\r\nwhen the mahauts drove them towards it, but got off in another\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Preparations for ferrying the Indus._[1595])\r\n\r\nOn the day we were in Bīgrām, several of the begs and household were\r\nappointed, with pay-masters and dīwāns, six or seven being put in\r\ncommand, to take charge of the boats at the Nīl-āb crossing, to make a\r\nlist of all who were with the army, name by name, and to count them up.\r\n\r\nThat evening I had fever and discharge[1596] which led on to cough and\r\nevery time I coughed, I spat blood. Anxiety was great but, by God's\r\nmercy, it passed off in two or three days.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 11th_) It rained when we left Bīgrām; we dismounted on the\r\nKābul-water.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. News from Lāhor._)\r\n\r\nNews came that Daulat Khān[1597] and (Apāq) Ghāzī Khān, having collected\r\nan army of from 20 to 30,000, had taken Kilānūr, and intended to move on\r\nLāhor. At once Mumin-i-`alī the commissary was sent galloping off to\r\nsay, \"We are advancing march by march;[1598] do not fight till we\r\narrive.\"\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 14th_) With two night-halts on the way, we reached the water of\r\nSind (Indus), and there dismounted on Thursday the 28th (of Ṣafar).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Ferrying the Indus._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 16th_) On Saturday the 1st of the first Rabī`, we crossed the\r\nSind-water, crossed the water of Kacha-kot (Hārū), and dismounted on the\r\nbank of the river.[1599] The begs, pay-masters and dīwāns who had been\r\nput in charge of the boats, reported that the number of those come with\r\nthe army, great and small, good and bad, retainer and non-retainer, was\r\nwritten down as 12,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. The eastward march._)\r\n\r\nThe rainfall had been somewhat scant in the plains, but [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n254b.] seemed to have been good in the cultivated lands along the\r\nhill-skirts; for these reasons we took the road for Sīālkot along the\r\nskirt-hills. Opposite Hātī _Kakar's_ country[1600] we came upon a\r\ntorrent[1601] the waters of which were standing in pools. Those pools\r\nwere all frozen over. The ice was not very thick, as thick as the hand\r\nmay-be. Such ice is unusual in Hindūstān; not a sign or trace of any was\r\nseen in the years we were (_aīdūk_) in the country.[1602]\r\n\r\nWe had made five marches from the Sind-water; after the sixth (_Dec.\r\n22nd_—Rabī` I. 7th) we dismounted on a torrent in the camping-ground\r\n(_yūrt_) of the Bugīāls[1603] below Balnāth Jogī's hill which connects\r\nwith the Hill of Jūd.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 23rd_) In order to let people get provisions, we stayed the next\r\nday in that camp. _`Araq_ was drunk on that day. Mullā Muḥ. _Pargharī_\r\ntold many stories; never had he been so talkative. Mullā Shams himself\r\nwas very riotous; once he began, he did not finish till night.\r\n\r\nThe slaves and servants, good and bad, who had gone out after\r\nprovisions, went further than this[1604] and heedlessly scattered over\r\njungle and plain, hill and broken ground. Owing to this, a few were\r\novercome; Kīchkīna _tūnqiṯār_ died there.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 24th_) Marching on, we crossed the Bihat-water at a ford below\r\nJīlam (Jīhlam) and there dismounted. Walī _Qīzīl_ (Rufus) came there to\r\nsee me. He was the Sīālkot reserve, and held the parganas of Bīmrūkī and\r\nAkrīāda. Thinking about Sīālkot, [Sidenote: Fol. 255.] I took towards\r\nhim the position of censure and reproach. He excused himself, saying \"I\r\nhad come to my _pargana_ before Khusrau Kūkūldāsh left Sīālkot; he did\r\nnot even send me word.\" After listening to his excuse, I said, \"Since\r\nthou hast paid no attention to Sīālkot, why didst thou not join the begs\r\nin Lāhor?\" He was convicted, but as work was at hand, I did not trouble\r\nabout his fault.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Scouts sent with orders to Lāhor._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 25th_) Sayyid T̤ūfān and Sayyid Lāchīn were sent galloping off,\r\neach with a pair-horse,[1605] to say in Lāhor, \"Do not join battle; meet\r\nus at Sīālkot or Parsrūr\" (mod. Pasrūr). It was in everyone's mouth that\r\nGhāzī Khān had collected 30 to 40,000 men, that Daulat Khān, old as he\r\nwas, had girt two swords to his waist, and that they were resolved to\r\nfight. Thought I, \"The proverb says that ten friends are better than\r\nnine; do you not make a mistake: when the Lāhor begs have joined you,\r\nfight there and then!\"\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 26th and 27th_) After starting off the two men to the begs, we\r\nmoved forward, halted one night, and next dismounted on the bank of the\r\nChīn-āb (Chan-āb).\r\n\r\nAs Buhlūlpūr was _khalṣa_,[1606] we left the road to visit it. Its fort\r\nis situated above a deep ravine, on the bank of the Chīn-āb. It pleased\r\nus much. We thought of bringing Sīālkot to it. Please God! the chance\r\ncoming, it shall be done straightway! [Sidenote: Fol. 255b.] From\r\nBuhlūlpūr we went to camp by boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Jats and Gujūrs._[1607])\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 29th_) On Friday the 14th of the first Rabī` we dismounted at\r\nSīālkot. If one go into Hindūstān the Jats and Gujūrs always pour down\r\nin countless hordes from hill and plain for loot in bullock and buffalo.\r\nThese ill-omened peoples are just senseless oppressors! Formerly their\r\ndoings did not concern us much because the country was an enemy's, but\r\nthey began the same senseless work after we had taken it. When we\r\nreached Sīālkot, they fell in tumult on poor and needy folks who were\r\ncoming out of the town to our camp, and stripped them bare. I had the\r\nsilly thieves sought for, and ordered two or three of them cut to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nFrom Sīālkot Nūr Beg's brother Shāham also was made to gallop off to the\r\nbegs in Lāhor to say, \"Make sure where the enemy is; find out from some\r\nwell-informed person where he may be met, and send us word.\"\r\n\r\nA trader, coming into this camp, represented that `Ālam Khān had let Sl.\r\nIbrāhīm defeat him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. `Ālam Khān's action and failure._[1608])\r\n\r\nHere are the particulars:—`Ālam Khān, after taking leave of me (in\r\nKābul, 931 AH.), went off in that heat by double marches, regardless of\r\nthose with him.[1609] As at the time I gave him leave to go, all the\r\nAūzbeg khāns and sulṯāns had laid siege to Balkh, [Sidenote: Fol. 256.]\r\nI rode for Balkh as soon as I had given him his leave. On his reaching\r\nLāhor, he insisted to the begs, \"You reinforce me; the Pādshāh said so;\r\nmarch along with me; let us get (Apāq) Ghāzī Khān to join us; let us\r\nmove on Dihlī and Āgra.\" Said they, \"Trusting to what, will you join\r\nGhāzī Khān? Moreover the royal orders to us were, 'If at any time Ghāzī\r\nKhān has sent his younger brother Ḥājī Khān with his son to Court, join\r\nhim; or do so, if he has sent them, by way of pledge, to Lāhor; if he\r\nhas done neither, do not join him.' You yourself only yesterday fought\r\nhim and let him beat you! Trusting to what, will you join him now?\r\nBesides all this, it is not for your advantage to join him!\" Having said\r\nwhat-not of this sort, they refused `Ālam Khān. He did not fall in with\r\ntheir views, but sent his son Sher Khān to speak with Daulat Khān and\r\nwith Ghāzī Khān, and afterwards all saw one another.\r\n\r\n`Ālam Khān took with him Dilāwar Khān, who had come into Lāhor two or\r\nthree months earlier after his escape from prison; he took also Maḥmūd\r\nKhān (son of) Khān-i-jahān,[1610] to whom a _pargana_ in the Lāhor\r\ndistrict had been given. They seem to have left matters at this:—Daulat\r\nKhān with Ghāzī Khān was to take all the begs posted in Hindūstān to\r\nhimself, indeed he was to take everything on that side;[1611] while\r\n`Ālam [Sidenote: Fol. 256b.] Khān was to take Dilāwar Khān and Ḥājī Khān\r\nand, reinforced by them, was to capture Dihlī and Āgra. Ismā`īl\r\n_Jilwānī_ and other amīrs came and saw `Ālam Khān; all then betook\r\nthemselves, march by march, straight for Dihlī. Near Indrī came also\r\nSulaimān Shaikh-zāda.[1612] Their total touched 30 to 40,000 men.\r\n\r\nThey laid siege to Dihlī but could neither take it by assault nor do\r\nhurt to the garrison.[1613] When Sl. Ibrāhīm heard of their assembly, he\r\ngot an army to horse against them; when they heard of his approach, they\r\nrose from before the place and moved to meet him. They had left matters\r\nat this:—\"If we attack by day-light, the Afghāns will not desert (to\r\nus), for the sake of their reputations with one another; but if we\r\nattack at night when one man cannot see another, each man will obey his\r\nown orders.\" Twice over they started at fall of day from a distance of\r\n12 miles (6 _kurohs_), and, unable to bring matters to a point, neither\r\nadvanced nor retired; but just sat on horseback for two or three\r\nwatches. On a third occasion they delivered an attack when one watch of\r\nnight remained—their purpose seeming to be the burning of tents and\r\nhuts! They went; they set fire from every end; they made a disturbance.\r\nJalāl Khān _Jig-hat_[1614] came with other amīrs and saw `Ālam Khān.\r\n\r\nSl. Ibrāhīm did not bestir himself till shoot of dawn from where he was\r\nwith a few of his own family[1615] within his own enclosure (_sarācha_).\r\nMeantime `Ālam Khān's people were busy [Sidenote: Fol. 257.] with\r\nplunder and booty. Seeing the smallness of their number, Sl. Ibrāhīm's\r\npeople moved out against them in rather small force with one elephant.\r\n`Ālam Khān's party, not able to make stand against the elephant, ran\r\naway. He in his flight crossed over into the Mīān-dū-āb and crossed back\r\nagain when he reached the Pānīpat neighbourhood. In Indrī he contrived\r\non some pretext to get 4 _laks_ from Mīān Sulaimān.[1616] He was\r\ndeserted by Ismā`īl _Jilwānī_, by Biban[1617] and by his own oldest son\r\nJalāl, who all withdrew into the Mīān-dū-āb; and he had been deserted\r\njust before the fighting, by part of his troops, namely, by Daryā Khān\r\n(_Nūḥānī_)'s son Saif Khān, by Khān-i-jahān (_Nūḥānī_)'s son Maḥmūd\r\nKhān, and by Shaikh Jamāl _Farmulī_. When he was passing through Sihrind\r\nwith Dilāwar Khān, he heard of our advance and of our capture of Milwat\r\n(Malot).[1618] On this Dilāwar Khān—who always had been my well-wisher\r\nand on my account had dragged out three or four months in prison,—left\r\n`Ālam Khān and the rest and went to his family in Sulṯānpūr. He waited\r\non me three or four days after we took Milwat. `Ālam Khān and Ḥājī Khān\r\ncrossed the Shatlut (_sic_)-water and went into Gingūta,[1619] one of\r\nthe strongholds in the range that lies between the valley and the\r\nplain.[1620] There our Afghān and Hazāra[1621] troops besieged them, and\r\nhad [Sidenote: Fol. 257b] almost taken that strong fort when night came\r\non. Those inside were thinking of escape but could not get out because\r\nof the press of horses in the Gate. There must have been elephants also;\r\nwhen these were urged forward, they trod down and killed many horses.\r\n`Ālam Khān, unable to escape mounted, got out on foot in the darkness.\r\nAfter a _lak_ of difficulties, he joined Ghāzī Khān, who had not gone\r\ninto Milwat but had fled into the hills. Not being received with even a\r\nlittle friendliness by Ghāzī Khān; needs must! he came and waited on me\r\nat the foot of the dale[1622] near Pehlūr.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Diary resumed._)\r\n\r\nA person came to Sīālkot from the Lāhor begs to say they would arrive\r\nearly next morning to wait on me.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 30th_) Marching early next day (Rabī` I. 15th), we dismounted at\r\nParsrūr. There Muḥ. `Alī _Jang-jang_, Khwāja Ḥusain and several braves\r\nwaited on me. As the enemy's camp seemed to be on the Lāhor side of the\r\nRāvī, we sent men out under Būjka for news. Near the third watch of the\r\nnight they brought word that the enemy, on hearing of us, had fled, no\r\nman looking to another.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 31st_) Getting early to horse and leaving baggage and train in\r\nthe charge of Shāh Mīr Ḥusain and Jān Beg, we bestirred ourselves. We\r\nreached Kalānūr in the afternoon, and there dismounted. Muḥammad Sl.\r\nMīrzā and `Ādil Sl.[1623] came [Sidenote: Fol. 258.] to wait on me\r\nthere, together with some of the begs.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 1st 1526 AD._) We marched early from Kalānūr. On the road people\r\ngave us almost certain news of Ghāzī Khān and other fugitives.\r\nAccordingly we sent, flying after those fliers, the commanders\r\nMuḥammadī, Aḥmadī, Qūtlūq-qadam, Treasurer Walī and most of those begs\r\nwho, in Kābul, had recently bent the knee for their begship. So far it\r\nwas settled:—That it would be good indeed if they could overtake and\r\ncapture the fugitives; and that, if they were not able to do this, they\r\nwere to keep careful watch round Milwat (Malot), so as to prevent those\r\ninside from getting out and away. Ghāzī Khān was the object of this\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Capture of Milwat._)\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 2nd and 3rd_) After starting those begs ahead, we crossed the\r\nBīāh-water (Beas) opposite Kanwāhīn[1624] and dismounted. From there we\r\nmarched to the foot of the valley of Fort Milwat, making two night-halts\r\non the way. The begs who had arrived before us, and also those of\r\nHindūstān were ordered to dismount in such a way as to besiege the place\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\nA grandson of Daulat Khān, son of his eldest son `Alī Khān, Ismā`īl Khān\r\nby name, came out of Milwat to see me; he took back promise mingled with\r\nthreat, kindness with menace.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 5th_) On Friday (Rabī` I. 21st) I moved camp forward to within a\r\nmile of the fort, went myself to examine the place, posted right, left\r\nand centre, then returned to camp.\r\n\r\nDaulat Khān sent to represent to me that Ghāzī Khān had [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n258b.] fled into the hills, and that, if his own faults were pardoned,\r\nhe would take service with me and surrender Milwat. Khwāja Mīr-i-mīrān\r\nwas sent to chase fear from his heart and to escort him out; he came,\r\nand with him his son `Alī Khān. I had ordered that the two swords he had\r\ngirt to his waist to fight me with, should be hung from his neck. Was\r\nsuch a rustic blockhead possible! With things as they were, he still\r\nmade pretensions! When he was brought a little forward, I ordered the\r\nswords to be removed from his neck. At the time of our seeing one\r\nanother[1625] he hesitated to kneel; I ordered them to pull his leg and\r\nmake him do so. I had him seated quite in front, and ordered a person\r\nwell acquainted with Hindūstānī to interpret my words to him, one after\r\nanother. Said I, \"Thus speak:—I called thee Father. I shewed thee more\r\nhonour and respect than thou couldst have asked. Thee and thy sons I\r\nsaved from door-to-door life amongst the Balūchīs.[1626] Thy family and\r\nthy _ḥaram_ I freed from Ibrāhīm's prison-house.[1627] Three _krors_ I\r\ngave thee on Tātār Khān's lands.[1628] What ill sayest thou I have done\r\nthee, that thus thou shouldst hang a sword on thy either side,[1629]\r\nlead an army out, fall on lands of ours,[1630] and stir strife and\r\ntrouble?\" Dumbfounded, the old man [Sidenote: Fol. 259.] stuttered a\r\nfew words, but, he gave no answer, nor indeed could answer be given to\r\nwords so silencing. He was ordered to remain with Khwāja Mīr-i-mīrān.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 6th_) On Saturday the 22nd of the first Rabī`, I went myself to\r\nsafeguard the exit of the families and _ḥarams_[1631] from the fort,\r\ndismounting on a rise opposite the Gate. To me there came `Alī Khān and\r\nmade offering of a few _ashrafīs_. People began to bring out the\r\nfamilies just before the Other Prayer. Though Ghāzī Khān was reported to\r\nhave got away, there were some who said they had seen him in the fort.\r\nFor this reason several of the household and braves[1632] were posted at\r\nthe Gate, in order to prevent his escape by a ruse, for to get away was\r\nhis full intention.[1633] Moreover if jewels and other valuables were\r\nbeing taken away by stealth, they were to be confiscated. I spent that\r\nnight in a tent pitched on the rise in front of the Gate.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 7th_) Early next morning, Muḥammadī, Aḥmadī, Sl. Junaid,\r\n`Abdu'l-`azīz, Muḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang_ and Qūtlūq-qadam were ordered\r\nto enter the fort and take possession of all [Sidenote: Fol. 259b.]\r\neffects. As there was much disturbance at the Gate, I shot off a few\r\narrows by way of chastisement. Humāyūn's story-teller (_qiṣṣa-khẉān_)\r\nwas struck by the arrow of his destiny and at once surrendered his life.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 7th and 8th_) After spending two nights[1634] on the rise, I\r\ninspected the fort. I went into Ghāzī Khān's book-room;[1635] some of\r\nthe precious things found in it, I gave to Humāyūn, some sent to Kāmrān\r\n(in Qandahār). There were many books of learned contents,[1636] but not\r\nso many valuable ones as had at first appeared. I passed that night in\r\nthe fort; next morning I went back to camp.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 9th_) It had been in our minds that Ghāzī Khān was in the fort,\r\nbut he, a man devoid of nice sense of honour, had escaped to the hills,\r\nabandoning father, brethren and sisters in Milwat.\r\n\r\n   See that man without honour who never\r\n   The face of good luck shall behold;\r\n   Bodily ease he chose for himself,\r\n   In hardship he left wife and child (_Gulistān_ cap. i, story 17).\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 10th_) Leaving that camp on Wednesday, we moved towards the hills\r\nto which Ghāzī Khān had fled. When we dismounted in the valley-bottom\r\ntwo miles from the camp in the mouth of Milwat,[1637] Dilāwar Khān came\r\nand waited on me. Daulat Khān, `Alī Khān and Ismā`īl Khān, with other\r\nchiefs, were given into Kitta Beg's charge who was to convey them to the\r\nBhīra fort of Milwat (Malot),[1638] and there keep guard over [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 260.] them. In agreement with Dilāwar Khān, blood-ransom was fixed\r\nfor some who had been made over each to one man; some gave security,\r\nsome were kept prisoner. Daulat Khān died when Kitta Beg reached\r\nSulṯānpūr with the prisoners.[1639]\r\n\r\nMilwat was given into the charge of Muḥ. `Alī _Jang-jang_ who, pledging\r\nhis own life for it, left his elder brother Arghūn and a party of braves\r\nin it. A body of from 200 to 250 Afghāns were told off to reinforce him.\r\n\r\nKhwāja Kalān had loaded several camels with Ghaznī wines. A party was\r\nheld in his quarters overlooking the fort and the whole camp, some\r\ndrinking _`araq_, some wine. It was a varied party.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Jaswān-valley._)\r\n\r\nMarching on, we crossed a low hill of the grazing-grounds\r\n(_arghā-dāl-līq_) of Milwat and went into the _dūn_, as Hindūstānīs\r\nare understood to call a dale (_julga_).[1640] In this dale is a\r\nrunning-water[1641] of Hindūstān; along its sides are many villages; and\r\nit is said to be the pargana of the Jaswāl, that is to say, of Dilāwar\r\nKhān's maternal uncles. It lies there shut-in, with meadows along its\r\ntorrent, rice cultivated here and there, a three or four mill-stream\r\nflowing in its trough, its width from two to [Sidenote: Fol. 260b.] four\r\nmiles, six even in places, villages on the skirts of its hills—hillocks\r\nthey are rather—where there are no villages, peacocks, monkeys, and many\r\nfowls which, except that they are mostly of one colour, are exactly like\r\nhouse-fowls.\r\n\r\nAs no reliable news was had of Ghāzī Khān, we arranged for Tardīka to go\r\nwith Bīrīm Deo _Malinhās_ and capture him wherever he might be found.\r\n\r\nIn the hills of this dale stand thoroughly strong forts; one on the\r\nnorth-east, named Kūtila, has sides 70 to 80 yards (_qārī_) of straight\r\nfall, the side where the great gate is being perhaps 7 or 8 yards.[1642]\r\nThe width of the place where the draw-bridge is made, may be 10 to 12\r\nyards. Across this they have made a bridge of two tall trees[1643] by\r\nwhich horses and herds are taken over. This was one of the local forts\r\nGhāzī Khān had strengthened; his man will have been in it now. Our\r\nraiders (_chāpqūnchī_) assaulted it and had almost taken it when night\r\ncame on. The garrison abandoned this difficult place and went off. Near\r\nthis dale is also the stronghold of Ginguta; it is girt round by\r\nprecipices as Kūtila is, but is not so strong as Kūtila. As has been\r\nmentioned `Ālam Khān went into it.[1644] [Sidenote: Fol. 261.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. Bābur advances against Ibrāhīm._)\r\n\r\nAfter despatching the light troop against Ghāzī Khān, I put my foot in\r\nthe stirrup of resolution, set my hand on the rein of trust in God, and\r\nmoved forward against Sulṯān Ibrāhīm, son of Sulṯān Sikandar, son of\r\nBuhlūl _Lūdī Afghān_, in possession of whose throne at that time were\r\nthe Dihlī capital and the dominions of Hindūstān, whose standing-army\r\nwas called a _lak_ (100,000), whose elephants and whose begs' elephants\r\nwere about 1,000.\r\n\r\nAt the end of our first stage, I bestowed Dībālpūr on Bāqī\r\n_shaghāwal_[1645] and sent him to help Balkh[1646]; sent also gifts,\r\ntaken in the success of Milwat, for (my) younger children and various\r\ntrain in Kābul.\r\n\r\nWhen we had made one or two marches down the (Jaswān) _dūn_, Shāh `Imād\r\n_Shīrāzī_ arrived from Araish Khān and Mullā Muḥammad _Maẕhab_,[1647]\r\nbringing letters that conveyed their good wishes for the complete\r\nsuccess of our campaign and indicated their effort and endeavour towards\r\nthis. In response, we sent, by a foot-man, royal letters expressing our\r\nfavour. We then marched on.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. `Ālam Khān takes refuge with Bābur._)\r\n\r\nThe light troop we had sent out from Milwat (Malot), took Hurūr, Kahlūr\r\nand all the hill-forts of the neighbourhood—places to which because of\r\ntheir strength, no-one seemed to have gone for a long time—and came back\r\nto me after plundering a little. Came also `Ālam Khān, on foot, ruined,\r\nstripped bare. We sent some of the begs to give him honourable meeting,\r\nsent horses too, and he waited (_malāẓamat qīldī_) in that [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 261b.] neighbourhood.[1648]\r\n\r\nRaiders of ours went into the hills and valleys round-about, but after a\r\nfew nights' absence, came back without anything to count. Shāh Mīr\r\nḤusain, Jān Beg and a few of the braves asked leave and went off for a\r\nraid.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. Incidents of the march for Pānī-pat._)\r\n\r\nWhile we were in the (Jaswān) _dūn_, dutiful letters had come more than\r\nonce from Ismā`īl _Jilwānī_ and Biban; we replied to them from this\r\nplace by royal letters such as their hearts desired. After we got out of\r\nthe dale to Rūpar, it rained very much and became so cold that a mass of\r\nstarved and naked Hindūstānīs died.\r\n\r\nWhen we had left Rūpar and were dismounted at Karal,[1649] opposite\r\nSihrind, a Hindūstānī coming said, \"I am Sl. Ibrāhīm's envoy,\" and\r\nthough he had no letter or credentials, asked for an envoy from us. We\r\nresponded at once by sending one or two Sawādī night-guards\r\n(_tunqiṯār_).[1650] These humble persons Ibrāhīm put in prison; they\r\nmade their escape and came back to us on the very day we beat him.\r\n\r\nAfter having halted one night on the way, we dismounted on the bank of\r\nthe torrent[1651] of Banūr and Sanūr. Great rivers apart, one running\r\nwater there is in Hindūstān, is this[1652]; they call it the water of\r\nKakar (Ghaggar). Chitr also is on its bank. We rode up it for an\r\nexcursion. The rising-place (_zih_) of the water of this torrent (_rūd_)\r\nis 3 or 4 _kurohs_ (6-8 m.) above Chitr. Going up the (Kakar) torrent,\r\nwe came to where a 4 or 5 millstream issues from a broad (side-)valley\r\n(_dara_), up which there [Sidenote: Fol. 262.] are very pleasant places,\r\nhealthy and convenient. I ordered a Chār-bāgh to be made at the mouth of\r\nthe broad valley of this (tributary) water, which falls into the\r\n(Kakar-) torrent after flowing for one or two _kurohs_ through level\r\nground. From its infall to the springs of the Kakar the distance may be\r\n3 to 4 _kurohs_ (6-8 m.). When it comes down in flood during the rains\r\nand joins the Kakar, they go together to Sāmāna and Sanām.[1653]\r\n\r\nIn this camp we heard that Sl. Ibrāhīm had been on our side of\r\nDihlī and had moved on from that station, also that Ḥamīd Khān\r\n_khāṣa-khail_,[1654] the military-collector (_shiqdār_) of Ḥiṣār-fīrūza,\r\nhad left that place with its army and with the army of its\r\nneighbourhood, and had advanced 10 or 15 _kurohs_ (20-30 m.). Kitta Beg\r\nwas sent for news to Ibrāhīm's camp, and Mumin Ātaka to the Ḥiṣār-fīrūza\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_q. Humāyūn moves against Ḥamīd Khān._)\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 25th_) Marching from Aṃbāla, we dismounted by the side of a lake.\r\nThere Mumin Ātāka and Kitta Beg rejoined us, both on the same day,\r\nSunday the 13th of the first Jumāda.\r\n\r\nWe appointed Humāyūn to act against Ḥamīd Khān, and joined the whole of\r\nthe right (wing) to him, that is to say, Khwāja Kalān, Sl. Muḥammad\r\n_Dūldāī_, Treasurer Walī, and also some of the begs whose posts were in\r\nHindūstān, namely, Khusrau, Hindū Beg,`Abdu'l-'azīz and Muḥammad `Alī\r\n_Jang-jang_, with also, from the household and braves of the centre,\r\nShāh Manṣūr _Barlās_, Kitta Beg and Muḥibb-i `alī. [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n262b.]\r\n\r\nBiban waited on me in this camp. These Afghāns remain very rustic and\r\ntactless! This person asked to sit although Dilāwar Khān, his superior\r\nin following and in rank, did not sit, and although the sons of `Ālam\r\nKhān, who are of royal birth, did not sit. Little ear was lent to his\r\nunreason!\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 26th_) At dawn on Monday the 14th Humāyūn moved out against Ḥamīd\r\nKhān. After advancing for some distance, he sent between 100 and 150\r\nbraves scouting ahead, who went close up to the enemy and at once got to\r\ngrips. But when after a few encounters, the dark mass of Humāyūn's\r\ntroops shewed in the rear, the enemy ran right away. Humāyūn's men\r\nunhorsed from 100 to 200, struck the heads off one half and brought the\r\nother half in, together with 7 or 8 elephants.\r\n\r\n(_March 2nd_) On Friday the 18th of the month, Beg Mīrak _Mughūl_\r\nbrought news of Humāyūn's victory to the camp. He (Humāyūn?) was there\r\nand then given a special head-to-foot and a special horse from the royal\r\nstable, besides promise of guerdon (_juldū_).\r\n\r\n(_March 5th_) On Monday the 25th of the month, Humāyūn arrived to wait\r\non me, bringing with him as many as 100 prisoners and 7 or 8 elephants.\r\nUstād `Alī-qulī and the [Sidenote: Fol. 263.] matchlockmen were ordered\r\nto shoot all the prisoners, by way of example. This had been Humāyūn's\r\nfirst affair, his first experience of battle; it was an excellent omen!\r\n\r\nOur men who had gone in pursuit of the fugitives, took Ḥiṣār-fīrūza at\r\nonce on arrival, plundered it, and returned to us. It was given in\r\nguerdon to Humāyūn, with all its dependencies and appurtenances, with it\r\nalso a _kror_ of money.\r\n\r\nWe marched from that camp to Shāhābād. After we had despatched a\r\nnews-gatherer (_tīl-tūtār kīshī_) to Sl. Ibrāhīm's camp, we stayed a few\r\ndays on that ground. Raḥmat the foot-man was sent with the letters of\r\nvictory to Kābul.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_r. News of Ibrāhīm._)\r\n\r\n(_March 13th_) On Monday the 28th of the first Jumāda,[1655] we being in\r\nthat same camp, the Sun entered the Sign of the Ram. News had come\r\nagain and again from Ibrāhīm's camp, \"He is coming, marching two miles\"\r\nor \"four miles\", \"stopping in each camp two days,\" or \"three days\". We\r\nfor our part advanced from Shāhābād and after halting on two nights,\r\nreached the bank of the Jūn-river (Jumna) and encamped opposite Sarsāwa.\r\nFrom that ground Khwāja Kalān's servant Ḥaidar-qulī was sent to get news\r\n(_tīl tūtā_).\r\n\r\nHaving crossed the Jūn-river at a ford, I visited Sarsāwa. That day also\r\nwe ate _ma`jūn_. Sarsāwa[1656] has a source (_chashma_) from which a\r\nsmallish stream issues, not a bad place! Tardī Beg _khāksār_ praising\r\nit, I said, \"Let it be thine!\" so just [Sidenote: Fol. 263b.] because he\r\npraised it, Sarsāwa was given to him!\r\n\r\nI had a platform fixed in a boat and used to go for excursions on the\r\nriver, sometimes too made the marches down it. Two marches along its\r\nbank had been made when, of those sent to gather news, Ḥaidar-qulī\r\nbrought word that Ibrāhīm had sent Daud Khān (_Lūdī_) and Ḥātīm Khān\r\n(_Lūdī_) across the river into the Mīān-dū-āb (Tween-waters) with 5 or\r\n6000 men, and that these lay encamped some 6 or 7 miles from his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_s. A successful encounter._)\r\n\r\n(_April 1st_) On Sunday the 18th of the second Jumāda, we sent, to ride\r\nlight against this force, Chīn-tīmūr Sulṯān,[1657] Mahdī Khwāja,\r\nMuḥammad Sl. Mīrzā, `Ādil Sulṯān, and the whole of the left, namely, Sl.\r\nJunaid, Shāh Mīr Ḥusain, Qūtlūq-qadam, and with them also sent\r\n`Abdu'l-lāh and Kitta Beg (of the centre). They crossed from our side of\r\nthe water at the Mid-day Prayer, and between the Afternoon and the\r\nEvening Prayers bestirred themselves from the other bank. Biban having\r\ncrossed the water on pretext of this movement, ran away.\r\n\r\n(_April 2nd_) At day-break they came upon the enemy;[1658] he made as if\r\ncoming out in a sort of array, but our men closed with his at once,\r\novercame them, hustled them off, pursued and unhorsed them till they\r\nwere opposite Ibrāhīm's own camp. Ḥātim Khān was one of those unhorsed,\r\nwho was Daud Khān (_Lūdī_)'s elder brother and one of his commanders.\r\nOur men brought him in when they waited on me. They brought also\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 264.] 60-70 prisoners and 6 or 7 elephants. Most of the\r\nprisoners, by way of warning, were made to reach their death-doom.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_t. Preparations for battle._)\r\n\r\nWhile we were marching on in array of right, left and centre, the army\r\nwas numbered;[1659] it did not count up to what had been estimated.\r\n\r\nAt our next camp it was ordered that every man in the army should\r\ncollect carts, each one according to his circumstances. Seven hundred\r\ncarts (_arāba_) were brought[1660] in. The order given to Ustād\r\n`Alī-qulī was that these carts should be joined together in\r\nOttoman[1661] fashion, but using ropes of raw hide instead of chains,\r\nand that between every two carts 5 or 6 mantelets should be fixed,\r\nbehind which the matchlockmen were to stand to fire. To allow of\r\ncollecting all appliances, we delayed 5 or 6 days in that camp. When\r\neverything was ready, all the begs with such braves as had had\r\nexperience in military affairs were summoned to a General Council where\r\nopinion found decision at this:—Pānī-pat[1662] is there with its crowded\r\nhouses and suburbs. It would be on one side of us; our other sides must\r\nbe protected by carts and mantelets behind which our foot and\r\nmatchlockmen would stand. With so much settled we marched forward,\r\nhalted one night on the way, and reached Pānī-pat on Thursday the last\r\nday (29th) of the second Jumāda (April 12th).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_u. The opposed forces._)\r\n\r\nOn our right was the town of Pānī-pat with its suburbs; in front of us\r\nwere the carts and mantelets we had prepared; on our left and elsewhere\r\nwere ditch and branch. At distances of [Sidenote: Fol. 264b.] an arrow's\r\nflight[1663] sally-places were left for from 100 to 200 horsemen.\r\n\r\nSome in the army were very anxious and full of fear. Nothing recommends\r\nanxiety and fear. For why? Because what God has fixed in eternity cannot\r\nbe changed. But though this is so, it was no reproach to be afraid and\r\nanxious. For why? Because those thus anxious and afraid were there with\r\na two or three months' journey between them and their homes; our affair\r\nwas with a foreign tribe and people; none knew their tongue, nor did\r\nthey know ours:—\r\n\r\n   A wandering band, with mind awander;\r\n   In the grip of a tribe, a tribe unfamiliar.[1664]\r\n\r\nPeople estimated the army opposing us at 100,000 men; Ibrāhīm's\r\nelephants and those of his amīrs were said to be about 1000. In his\r\nhands was the treasure of two forbears.[1665] In Hindūstān, when work\r\nsuch as this has to be done, it is customary to pay out money to hired\r\nretainers who are known as _b:d-hindī_.[1666] If it had occurred to\r\nIbrāhīm to do this, he might have had another _lak_ or two of troops.\r\nGod brought it right! Ibrāhīm could neither content his braves, nor\r\nshare out his treasure. How should he content his braves when he was\r\nruled by avarice and had a craving insatiable to pile coin on coin? He\r\nwas an unproved brave[1667]; he provided nothing for his [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n265.] military operations, he perfected nothing, nor stand, nor move,\r\nnor fight.\r\n\r\nIn the interval at Pānī-pat during which the army was preparing defence\r\non our every side with cart, ditch and branch, Darwīsh-i-muḥammad\r\n_Sārbān_ had once said to me, \"With such precautions taken, how is it\r\npossible for him to come?\" Said I, \"Are you likening him to the Aūzbeg\r\nkhāns and sulṯāns? In what of movement under arms or of planned\r\noperations is he to be compared with them?\" God brought it right! Things\r\nfell out just as I said!\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on the Aūzbeg chiefs._) When I reached Ḥiṣār\r\n   in the year I left Samarkand (918 AH.-1512 AD.), and all the\r\n   Aūzbeg khāns and sulṯāns gathered and came against us, we\r\n   brought the families and the goods of the Mughūls and soldiers\r\n   into the Ḥiṣār suburbs and fortified these by closing the\r\n   lanes. As those khāns and sulṯāns were experienced in\r\n   equipment, in planned operations, and in resolute resistance,\r\n   they saw from our fortification of Ḥiṣār that we were\r\n   determined on life or death within it, saw they could not\r\n   count on taking it by assault and, therefore, retired at once\r\n   from near Nūndāk of Chaghānīān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_v. Preliminary encounters._)\r\n\r\nDuring the 7 or 8 days we lay in Pānī-pat, our men used to go, a few\r\ntogether, close up to Ibrāhīm's camp, rain arrows down on his massed\r\ntroops, cut off and bring in heads. Still he made [Sidenote: Fol. 265b.]\r\nno move; nor did his troops sally out. At length, we acted on the advice\r\nof several Hindūstānī well-wishers and sent out 4 or 5000 men to deliver\r\na night-attack on his camp, the leaders of it being Mahdī Khwāja,\r\nMuḥammad Sl. Mīrzā, `Ādil Sulṯān, Khusrau, Shāh Mīr Ḥusain, Sl. Junaid\r\n_Barlās_, `Abdu'l-`azīz the Master of the Horse, Muḥ. `Alī _Jang-jang_,\r\nQūtlūq-qadam, Treasurer Walī, Khalīfa's Muḥibb-i-`alī, Pay-master\r\nMuḥammad, Jān Beg and Qarā-qūzī. It being dark, they were not able to\r\nact together well, and, having scattered, could effect nothing on\r\narrival. They stayed near Ibrāhīm's camp till dawn, when the nagarets\r\nsounded and troops of his came out in array with elephants. Though our\r\nmen did not do their work, they got off safe and sound; not a man of\r\nthem was killed, though they were in touch with such a mass of foes. One\r\narrow pierced Muḥ. `Alī _Jang-jang_'s leg; though the wound was not\r\nmortal, he was good-for-nothing on the day of battle.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of this affair, I sent off Humāyūn and his troops to go 2 or\r\n3 miles to meet them, and followed him myself with the rest of the army\r\nin battle-array. The party of the night-attack joined him and came back\r\nwith him. The enemy making no further advance, we returned to camp and\r\ndismounted. That night a false alarm fell on the camp; for some 20\r\nminutes (one _garī_) there were uproar and call-to-arms; the disturbance\r\ndied down after a time. [Sidenote: Fol. 266.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_w. Battle of Pānī-pat._[1668])\r\n\r\n(_April 20th_) On Friday the 8th of Rajab,[1669] news came, when it was\r\nlight enough to distinguish one thing from another (_farẓ-waqtī_) that\r\nthe enemy was advancing in fighting-array. We at once put on mail,[1670]\r\narmed and mounted.[1671] Our right was Humāyūn, Khwāja Kalān, Sulṯān\r\nMuḥammad _Dūldāī_, Hindū Beg, Treasurer Walī and Pīr-qulī _Sīstānī_; our\r\nleft was Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā, Mahdī Khwāja, `Ādil Sulṯān, Shāh Mīr\r\nḤusain, Sl. Junaid _Barlās_, Qūtlūq-qadam, Jān Beg, Pay-master Muḥammad,\r\nand Shāh Ḥusain (of) Yāragī _Mughūl Ghānchī_(?).[1672] The right hand of\r\nthe centre[1673] was Chīn-tīmūr Sulṯān, Sulaimān Mīrzā,[1674] Muḥammadī\r\nKūkūldāsh, Shāh Manṣūr _Barlās_, Yūnas-i-`alī, Darwīsh-i-muḥammad\r\n_Sārbān_ and `Abdu'l-lāh the librarian. The left of the centre was\r\nKhalīfa, Khwāja Mīr-i-mīrān, Secretary Aḥmadī, Tardī Beg (brother) of\r\nQūj Beg, Khalīfa's Muḥibb-i-`alī and Mīrzā Beg Tarkhān. The advance was\r\nKhusrau Kūkūldāsh and Muḥ. `Alī _Jang-jang_. `Abdu'l-'azīz the Master\r\nof the Horse was posted as the reserve. For the turning-party\r\n(_tūlghuma_) at the point of the right wing,[1675] we fixed on Red Walī\r\nand Malik Qāsim (brother) of Bābā _Qashqa_, with their Mughūls; for the\r\nturning-party at the point of the left wing, we arrayed Qarā-qūzī,\r\nAbū'l-muḥammad the lance-player, Shaikh Jamāl _Bārīn's_ Shaikh `Alī,\r\nMahndī(?) and Tīngrī-bīrdī _Bashaghī_(?) _Mughūl_; these two parties,\r\ndirectly the enemy got near, were to turn his rear, one from the right,\r\nthe other from the left. [Sidenote: Fol. 266b.]\r\n\r\nWhen the dark mass of the enemy first came in sight, he seemed to\r\nincline towards our right; `Abdu'l-`azīz, who was the right-reserve, was\r\nsent therefore to reinforce the right. From the time that Sl. Ibrāhīm's\r\nblackness first appeared, he moved swiftly, straight for us, without a\r\ncheck, until he saw the dark mass of our men, when his pulled up and,\r\nobserving our formation and array,[1676] made as if asking, \"To stand or\r\nnot? To advance or not?\" They could not stand; nor could they make their\r\nformer swift advance.\r\n\r\nOur orders were for the turning-parties to wheel from right and left to\r\nthe enemy's rear, to discharge arrows and to engage in the fight; and\r\nfor the right and left (wings) to advance and join battle with him. The\r\nturning-parties wheeled round and began to rain arrows down. Mahdī\r\nKhwāja was the first of the left to engage; he was faced by a troop\r\nhaving an elephant with it; his men's flights of arrows forced it to\r\nretire. To reinforce the left I sent Secretary Aḥmadī and also Qūj Beg's\r\nTardī Beg and Khalīfa's Muḥibb-i-'alī. On the right also there was some\r\nstubborn fighting. Orders were given for Muḥammadī Kūkūldāsh, Shāh\r\nManṣūr _Barlās_, Yūnas-i-`alī and `Abdu'l-lāh to engage those facing\r\nthem in front of the centre. From that same position Ustād `Alī-qulī\r\nmade good discharge of _firingī_ shots;[1677]\r\n\r\nMusṯafa the commissary for his part made excellent discharge [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 267.] of _zarb-zan_ shots from the left hand of the centre. Our\r\nright, left, centre and turning-parties having surrounded the enemy,\r\nrained arrows down on him and fought ungrudgingly. He made one or two\r\nsmall charges on our right and left but under our men's arrows, fell\r\nback on his own centre. His right and left hands (_qūl_) were massed in\r\nsuch a crowd that they could neither move forward against us nor force a\r\nway for flight.\r\n\r\nWhen the incitement to battle had come, the Sun was spear-high; till\r\nmid-day fighting had been in full force; noon passed, the foe was\r\ncrushed in defeat, our friends rejoicing and gay. By God's mercy and\r\nkindness, this difficult affair was made easy for us! In one half-day,\r\nthat armed mass was laid upon the earth. Five or six thousand men were\r\nkilled in one place close to Ibrāhīm. Our estimate of the other dead,\r\nlying all over the field, was 15 to 16,000, but it came to be known,\r\nlater in Āgra from the statements of Hindūstānīs, that 40 or 50,000 may\r\nhave died in that battle.[1678]\r\n\r\nThe foe defeated, pursuit and unhorsing of fugitives began. Our men\r\nbrought in amīrs of all ranks and the chiefs they captured; _mahauts_\r\nmade offering of herd after herd of elephants.\r\n\r\nIbrāhīm was thought to have fled; therefore, while pursuing [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 267b.] the enemy, we told off Qismatāī Mīrzā, Bābā _chuhra_ and\r\nBūjka of the _khaṣa-tābīn_[1679] to lead swift pursuit to Āgra and try\r\nto take him. We passed through his camp, looked into his own enclosure\r\n(_sarācha_) and quarters, and dismounted on the bank of standing-water\r\n(_qarā-sū_).\r\n\r\nIt was the Afternoon Prayer when Khalīfa's younger brother-in-law T̤āhir\r\nTībrī[1680] who had found Ibrāhīm's body in a heap of dead, brought in\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_x. Detachments sent to occupy Dihlī and Āgra._)\r\n\r\nOn that very same day we appointed Humāyūn Mīrzā[1681] to ride fast and\r\nlight to Āgra with Khwāja Kalān, Muḥammadī, Shāh Manṣūr _Barlās_,\r\nYūnas-i-`alī, `Abdu'l-lah and Treasurer Walī, to get the place into\r\ntheir hands and to mount guard over the treasure. We fixed on Mahdī\r\nKhwāja, with Muḥammad Sl. Mīrza, `Ādil Sulṯān, Sl. Junaid _Barlās_ and\r\nQūtlūq-qadam to leave their baggage, make sudden incursion on Dihlī, and\r\nkeep watch on the treasuries.[1682]\r\n\r\n(_April 21st_) We marched on next day and when we had gone 2 miles,\r\ndismounted, for the sake of the horses, on the bank of the Jūn (Jumna).\r\n\r\n(_April 24th_) On Tuesday (Rajab 12th), after we had halted on two\r\nnights and had made the circuit of Shaikh Niẓāmu'd-dīn _Auliyā_'s\r\ntomb[1683] we dismounted on the bank of the Jūn over against\r\nDihlī.[1684] That same night, being Wednesday-eve, we made an excursion\r\ninto the fort of Dihlī and there spent the night.\r\n\r\n(_April 25th_) Next day (Wednesday Rajab 13th) I made the circuit of\r\nKhwāja Quṯbu'd-dīn's[1685] tomb and visited the tombs and residences of\r\nSl. Ghiyāṣu'd-dīn _Balban_[1686] and Sl. `Alāu'u'd-dīn [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n268.] _Khiljī_,[1687] his Minār, and the Ḥauẓ-shamsī, Ḥauẓ-i-khaṣ and\r\nthe tombs and gardens of Sl. Buhlūl and Sl. Sikandar (_Lūdī_). Having\r\ndone this, we dismounted at the camp, went on a boat, and there _`araq_\r\nwas drunk.\r\n\r\nWe bestowed the Military Collectorate (_shiqdārlīghī_) of Dihlī on Red\r\nWalī, made Dost Dīwān in the Dihlī district, sealed the treasuries, and\r\nmade them over to their charge.\r\n\r\n(_April 26th_) On Thursday we dismounted on the bank of the Jūn, over\r\nagainst Tūghlūqābād.[1688]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_y. The khuṯba read for Bābur in Dihlī._)\r\n\r\n(_April 27th_) On Friday (Rajab 15th) while we remained on the same\r\nground, Maulānā Maḥmūd and Shaikh Zain went with a few others into Dihlī\r\nfor the Congregational Prayer, read the _khuṯba_ in my name, distributed\r\na portion of money to the poor and needy,[1689] and returned to camp.\r\n\r\n(_April 28th_) Leaving that ground on Saturday (Rajab 16th), we advanced\r\nmarch by march for Āgra. I made an excursion to Tūghlūqābād and rejoined\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\n(_May 4th_) On Friday (Rajab 22nd), we dismounted at the mansion\r\n(_manzil_) of Sulaimān _Farmulī_ in a suburb of Āgra, but as the place\r\nwas far from the fort, moved on the following day to Jalāl Khān\r\n_Jig:hat's_ house.\r\n\r\nOn Humāyūn's arrival at Āgra, ahead of us, the garrison had made excuses\r\nand false pretexts (about surrender). He and his noticing the want of\r\ndiscipline there was, said, \"The long hand may be laid on the Treasury\"!\r\nand so sat down to watch the roads out of Āgra till we should come.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_z. The great diamond._)\r\n\r\nIn Sultan Ibrāhīm's defeat the Rāja of Gūālīār Bikramājīt the Hindū had\r\ngone to hell.[1690] [Sidenote: Fol. 268b.]\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on Bikramājīt._) The ancestors of Bikramājīt\r\n   had ruled in Gūālīār for more than a hundred years.[1691]\r\n   Sikandar (_Lūdī_) had sat down in Āgra for several years in\r\n   order to take the fort; later on, in Ibrāhīm's time, `Aẕim\r\n   Humāyūn _Sarwānī_[1692] had completely invested it for some\r\n   while; following this, it was taken on terms under which\r\n   Shamsābād was given in exchange for it.[1693]\r\n\r\nBikramājīt's children and family were in Āgra at the time of Ibrāhīm's\r\ndefeat. When Humāyūn reached Āgra, they must have been planning to flee,\r\nbut his postings of men (to watch the roads) prevented this and guard\r\nwas kept over them. Humāyūn himself did not let them go (_bārghālī\r\nqūīmās_). They made him a voluntary offering of a mass of jewels and\r\nvaluables amongst which was the famous diamond which `Alāu'u'd-dīn must\r\nhave brought.[1694] Its reputation is that every appraiser has estimated\r\nits value at two and a half days' food for the whole world. Apparently\r\nit weighs 8 _mis̤qāls_.[1695] Humāyūn offered it to me when I arrived at\r\nĀgra; I just gave it him back.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_aa. Ibrāhīm's mother and entourage._)\r\n\r\nAmongst men of mark who were in the fort, there were Malik Dād _Karānī_,\r\nMillī _Sūrdūk_ and Fīrūz Khān _Mīwātī_. They, being convicted of false\r\ndealing, were ordered out for capital punishment. Several persons\r\ninterceded for Malik Dād _Karānī_ and four or five days passed in\r\ncomings and goings before the matter was arranged. We then shewed to\r\nthem (all?) kindness and favour in agreement with the petition made for\r\nthem, and we restored them all their goods.[1696] A _pargana_ worth 7\r\n_laks_[1697] was bestowed on Ibrāhīm's mother; _parganas_ were given\r\nalso to these begs of his.[1698] She was sent out of the fort with her\r\nold servants and given encamping-ground (_yūrt_) two miles below\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 269.] Āgra.\r\n\r\n(_May 10th_) I entered Āgra at the Afternoon Prayer of Thursday (Rajab\r\n28th) and dismounted at the mansion (_manzil_) of Sl. Ibrāhīm.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPEDITIONS OF TRAMONTANE MUḤAMMADANS INTO HIND.\r\n\r\n(_a. Bābur's five attempts on Hindūstān._)\r\n\r\nFrom the date 910 at which the country of Kābul was conquered, down to\r\nnow (932 AH.) (my) desire for Hindūstān had been constant, but owing\r\nsometimes to the feeble counsels of begs, sometimes to the\r\nnon-accompaniment of elder and younger brethren,[1699] a move on\r\nHindūstān had not been practicable and its territories had remained\r\nunsubdued. At length no such obstacles were left; no beg, great or small\r\n(_beg begāt_) of lower birth,[1700] could speak an opposing word. In 925\r\nAH. (1519 AD.) we led an army out and, after taking Bajaur by storm in\r\n2-3 _garī_ (44-66 minutes), and making a general massacre of its people,\r\nwent on into Bhīra. Bhīra we neither over-ran nor plundered; we imposed\r\na ransom on its people, taking from them in money and goods to the value\r\nof 4 _laks_ of _shāhrukhīs_ and having shared this out to the army and\r\nauxiliaries, returned to Kābul. From then till now we laboriously held\r\ntight[1701] to Hindūstān, five times leading an army into it.[1702] The\r\nfifth time, God the Most High, by his own mercy and favour, made such a\r\nfoe as Sl. Ibrāhīm the vanquished and loser, such a realm as Hindūstān\r\nour conquest and possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Three invaders from Tramontana._)\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the revered Prophet down till now[1703] three men from\r\nthat side[1704] have conquered and ruled Hindūstān. Sl. Maḥmūd\r\n_Ghāzī_[1705] was the first, who and whose descendants sat long on the\r\nseat of government in Hindūstān. Sl. Shihābu'd-dīn [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n269b.] of Ghūr was the second,[1706] whose slaves and dependants royally\r\nshepherded[1707] this realm for many years. I am the third.\r\n\r\nBut my task was not like the task of those other rulers. For why?\r\nBecause Sl. Maḥmūd, when he conquered Hindūstān, had the throne of\r\nKhurāsān subject to his rule, vassal and obedient to him were the\r\nsulṯāns of Khwārizm and the Marches (_Dāru'l-marz_), and under his hand\r\nwas the ruler of Samarkand. Though his army may not have numbered 2\r\n_laks_, what question is there that it[1708] was one. Then again, rājas\r\nwere his opponents; all Hindūstān was not under one supreme head\r\n(_pādshāh_), but each rāja ruled independently in his own country. Sl.\r\nShihābu'd-dīn again,—though he himself had no rule in Khurāsān, his\r\nelder brother Ghiyās̱u'd-dīn had it. The _T̤abaqāt-i-nāṣirī_[1709]\r\nbrings it forward that he once led into Hindūstān an army of 120,000\r\nmen and horse in mail.[1710] His opponents also were rāīs and rājas; one\r\nman did not hold all Hindūstān.\r\n\r\nThat time we came to Bhīra, we had at most some 1500 to 2000 men. We had\r\nmade no previous move on Hindūstān with an army equal to that which came\r\nthe fifth time, when we beat Sl. Ibrāhīm and conquered the realm of\r\nHindūstān, the total written down for which, taking one retainer with\r\nanother, and [Sidenote: Fol. 270.] with traders and servants, was\r\n12,000. Dependent on me were the countries of Badakhshān, Qūndūz, Kābul\r\nand Qandahār, but no reckonable profit came from them, rather it was\r\nnecessary to reinforce them fully because several lie close to an enemy.\r\nThen again, all Māwarā'u'n-nahr was in the power of the Aūzbeg khāns and\r\nsulṯāns, an ancient foe whose armies counted up to 100,000. Moreover\r\nHindūstān, from Bhīra to Bihār, was in the power of the Afghāns and in\r\nit Sl. Ibrāhīm was supreme. In proportion to his territory his army\r\nought to have been 5 _laks_, but at that time the Eastern amīrs were in\r\nhostility to him. His army was estimated at 100,000 and people said his\r\nelephants and those of his amīrs were 1000.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions, in this strength, and having in my rear 100,000\r\nold enemies such as are the Aūzbegs, we put trust in God and faced the\r\nruler of such a dense army and of domains so wide. As our trust was in\r\nHim, the most high God did not make our labour and hardships vain, but\r\ndefeated that powerful foe and conquered that broad realm. Not as due to\r\nstrength and effort of our own do we look upon this good fortune, but as\r\nhad solely through God's pleasure and kindness. We know that this\r\nhappiness was not the fruit of our own ambition and resolve, but that it\r\nwas purely from His mercy and favour.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF HINDŪSTĀN.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Hindūstān._)\r\n\r\nThe country of Hindūstān is extensive, full of men, and full [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 270b.] of produce. On the east, south, and even on the west, it\r\nends at its great enclosing ocean (_muḥiṯ daryā-sī-gha_). On the north\r\nit has mountains which connect with those of Hindū-kush, Kāfiristān and\r\nKashmīr. North-west of it lie Kābul, Ghaznī and Qandahār. Dihlī is held\r\n(_aīrīmīsh_) to be the capital of the whole of Hindūstān. From the death\r\nof Shihābu'd-dīn _Ghūrī_ (d. 602 AH.-1206 AD.) to the latter part of the\r\nreign of Sl. Fīrūz Shāh (_Tūghlūq Turk_ d. 790 AH.-1388 AD.), the\r\ngreater part of Hindūstān must have been under the rule of the sulṯāns\r\nof Dihlī.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Rulers contemporary with Bābur's conquest._)\r\n\r\nAt the date of my conquest of Hindūstān it was governed by five Musalmān\r\nrulers (_pādshāh_)[1711] and two Pagans (_kāfir_). These were the\r\nrespected and independent rulers, but there were also, in the hills and\r\njungles, many rāīs and rājas, held in little esteem (_kīchīk karīm_).\r\n\r\nFirst, there were the Afghāns who had possession of Dihlī, the capital,\r\nand held the country from Bhīra to Bihār. Jūnpūr, before their time, had\r\nbeen in possession of Sl. Ḥusain _Sharqī_ (Eastern)[1712] whose dynasty\r\nHindūstānīs call Pūrabī (Eastern). His ancestors will have been\r\ncup-bearers in the presence of Sl. Fīrūz Shāh and those (Tūghlūq)\r\nsulṯāns; they became supreme in Jūnpūr after his death.[1713] At that\r\ntime Dihlī was in the hands of Sl. `Alāu'u'd-dīn (`Ālam Khān) of the\r\nSayyid dynasty to whose ancestor Tīmūr Beg had given it when, after\r\nhaving captured it, he went away.[1714] Sl. Buhlūl _Lūdī_ and his son\r\n(Sikandar) got possession of the capital Jūnpūr and the capital Dihlī,\r\nand brought both under one government (881 AH.-1476 AD.).\r\n\r\nSecondly, there was Sl. Muḥammad Muz̤affer in Gujrāt; he departed from\r\nthe world a few days before the defeat of Sl. Ibrāhīm. He was skilled in\r\nthe Law, a ruler (_pādshāh_) seeking [Sidenote: Fol. 271.] after\r\nknowledge, and a constant copyist of the Holy Book. His dynasty people\r\ncall Tānk.[1715] His ancestors also will have been wine-servers to Sl.\r\nFīrūz Shāh and those (Tūghlūq) sulṯāns; they became possessed of Gujrāt\r\nafter his death.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there were the Bāhmanīs of the Dakkan (Deccan, _i.e._ South),\r\nbut at the present time no independent authority is left them; their\r\ngreat begs have laid hands on the whole country, and must be asked for\r\nwhatever is needed.[1716]\r\n\r\nFourthly, there was Sl. Maḥmūd in the country of Malwā, which people\r\ncall also Mandāū.[1717] His dynasty they call Khilīj (_Turk_). Rānā\r\nSangā had defeated Sl. Maḥmūd and taken possession of most of his\r\ncountry. This dynasty also has become feeble. Sl. Maḥmūd's ancestors\r\nalso must have been cherished by Sl. Fīrūz Shāh; they became possessed\r\nof the Malwā country after his death.[1718]\r\n\r\nFifthly, there was Naṣrat Shāh[1719] in the country of Bengal. His\r\nfather (Ḥusain Shāh), a sayyid styled `Alāu'u'd-dīn, had ruled in Bengal\r\nand Naṣrat Shāh attained to rule by inheritance. A surprising custom in\r\nBengal is that hereditary succession is rare. The royal office is\r\npermanent and there are permanent offices of amīrs, wazīrs and\r\nmanṣab-dārs (officials). It is the office that Bengalis regard with\r\nrespect. Attached to each office is a body of obedient, subordinate\r\nretainers and servants. If the royal heart demand that a person should\r\nbe dismissed [Sidenote: Fol. 271b.] and another be appointed to sit in\r\nhis place, the whole body of subordinates attached to that office become\r\nthe (new) office-holder's. There is indeed this peculiarity of the royal\r\noffice itself that any person who kills the ruler (_pādshāh_) and seats\r\nhimself on the throne, becomes ruler himself; amīrs, wazīrs, soldiers\r\nand peasants submit to him at once, obey him, and recognize him for the\r\nrightful ruler his predecessor in office had been.[1720] Bengalis say,\r\n\"We are faithful to the throne; we loyally obey whoever occupies it.\"\r\nAs for instance, before the reign of Naṣrat Shāh's father `Alāu'u'd-dīn,\r\nan Abyssinian (_Ḥabshī_, named Muz̤affar Shāh) had killed his sovereign\r\n(Maḥmūd Shāh _Ilyās_), mounted the throne and ruled for some time.\r\n`Alāu'u'd-dīn killed that Abyssinian, seated himself on the throne and\r\nbecame ruler. When he died, his son (Naṣrat) became ruler by\r\ninheritance. Another Bengali custom is to regard it as a disgraceful\r\nfault in a new ruler if he expend and consume the treasure of his\r\npredecessors. On coming to rule he must gather treasure of his own. To\r\namass treasure Bengalis regard as a glorious distinction. Another custom\r\nin Bengal is that from ancient times _parganas_ have been assigned to\r\nmeet the charges of the treasury, stables, and all royal expenditure and\r\nto defray these charges no impost is laid on other lands.\r\n\r\nThese five, mentioned above, were the great Musalmān rulers, honoured in\r\nHindūstān, many-legioned, and broad-landed. Of the Pagans the greater\r\nboth in territory and army, is the Rāja of Bījānagar.[1721] [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 272.]\r\n\r\nThe second is Rānā Sangā who in these latter days had grown great by his\r\nown valour and sword. His original country was Chitūr; in the downfall\r\nfrom power of the Mandāū sulṯāns, he became possessed of many of their\r\ndependencies such as Rantanbūr, Sārangpūr, Bhīlsān and Chandīrī.\r\nChandīrī I stormed in 934 AH. (1528 A.D.)[1722] and, by God's pleasure,\r\ntook it in a few hours; in it was Rānā Sangā's great and trusted man\r\nMidnī Rāo; we made general massacre of the Pagans in it and, as will be\r\nnarrated, converted what for many years had been a mansion of hostility,\r\ninto a mansion of Islām.\r\n\r\nThere are very many rāīs and rājas on all sides and quarters of\r\nHindūstān, some obedient to Islām, some, because of their remoteness or\r\nbecause their places are fastnesses, not subject to Musalmān rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Of Hindūstān._)\r\n\r\nHindūstān is of the first climate, the second climate, and the third\r\nclimate; of the fourth climate it has none. It is a wonderful country.\r\nCompared with our countries it is a different world; its mountains,\r\nrivers, jungles and deserts, its towns, its cultivated lands, its\r\nanimals and plants, its peoples and their tongues, its rains, and its\r\nwinds, are all different. In some respects the hot-country (_garm-sīl_)\r\nthat depends on Kābul, is like Hindūstān, but in others, it is\r\ndifferent. Once the water of Sind is crossed, everything is in the\r\nHindūstān way (_ṯāriq_) [Sidenote: Fol. 272b.] land, water, tree, rock,\r\npeople and horde, opinion and custom.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Of the northern mountains._)\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Sind-river (eastwards), there are countries, in the\r\nnorthern mountains mentioned above, appertaining to Kashmīr and once\r\nincluded in it, although most of them, as for example, Paklī and\r\nShahmang (?), do not now obey it. Beyond Kashmīr there are countless\r\npeoples and hordes, _parganas_ and cultivated lands, in the mountains.\r\nAs far as Bengal, as far indeed as the shore of the great ocean, the\r\npeoples are without break. About this procession of men no-one has been\r\nable to give authentic information in reply to our enquiries and\r\ninvestigations. So far people have been saying that they call these\r\nhill-men Kas.[1723] It has struck me that as a Hindūstānī pronounces\r\n_shīn_ as _sīn_ (_i.e._ _sh_ as _s_), and as Kashmīr is the one\r\nrespectable town in these mountains, no other indeed being heard of,\r\nHindūstānīs might pronounce it Kasmīr.[1724] These people trade in\r\nmusk-bags, _b:ḥrī-qūṯās_,[1725] saffron, lead and copper.\r\n\r\nHindīs call these mountains Sawālak-parbat. In the Hindī tongue\r\n_sawāī-lak_ means one lak and a quarter, that is, 125,000, and _parbat_\r\nmeans a hill, which makes 125,000 hills.[1726] The snow on these\r\nmountains never lessens; it is seen white from many districts of Hind,\r\nas, for example, Lāhor, Sihrind and Saṃbal. The range, which in Kābul is\r\nknown as Hindū-kush, comes from Kābul eastwards into Hindūstān, with\r\nslight inclination to the south. The Hindūstānāt[1727] are to the south\r\nof it. Tībet lies to the north of it and of that unknown horde called\r\nKas. [Sidenote: Fol. 273.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Of rivers._)\r\n\r\nMany rivers rise in these mountains and flow through Hindūstān. Six rise\r\nnorth of Sihrind, namely Sind, Bahat (Jīlam), Chān-āb [_sic_], Rāwī,\r\nBīāh, and Sutluj[1728]; all meet near Multān, flow westwards under the\r\nname of Sind, pass through the Tatta country and fall into the\r\n`Umān(-sea).\r\n\r\nBesides these six there are others, such as Jūn (Jumna), Gang (Ganges),\r\nRahap (Raptī?), Gūmtī, Gagar (Ghaggar), Sirū, Gandak, and many more; all\r\nunite with the Gang-daryā, flow east under its name, pass through the\r\nBengal country, and are poured into the great ocean. They all rise in\r\nthe Sawālak-parbat.\r\n\r\nMany rivers rise in the Hindūstān hills, as, for instance, Chaṃbal,\r\nBanās, Bītwī, and Sūn (Son). There is no snow whatever on these\r\nmountains. Their waters also join the Gang-daryā.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Of the Arāvallī._)\r\n\r\nAnother Hindūstān range runs north and south. It begins in the Dihlī\r\ncountry at a small rocky hill on which is Fīrūz Shāh's residence, called\r\nJahān-nāma,[1729] and, going on from there, appears near Dihlī in\r\ndetached, very low, scattered here and there, rocky [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n273b.] little hills.[1730] Beyond Mīwāt, it enters the Bīāna country.\r\nThe hills of Sīkrī, Bārī and Dūlpūr are also part of this same including\r\n(tūtā) range. The hills of Gūālīār—they write it Gālīūr—although they do\r\nnot connect with it, are off-sets of this range; so are the hills of\r\nRantanbūr, Chitūr, Chandīrī, and Mandāū. They are cut off from it in\r\nsome places by 7 to 8 _kurohs_ (14 to 16 m.). These hills are very low,\r\nrough, rocky and jungly. No snow whatever falls on them. They are the\r\nmakers, in Hindūstān, of several rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Irrigation._)\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the Hindūstān country is situated on level land.\r\nMany though its towns and cultivated lands are, it nowhere has running\r\nwaters.[1731] Rivers and, in some places, standing-waters are its\r\n\"running-waters\" (_āqār-sūlār_). Even where, as for some towns, it is\r\npracticable to convey water by digging channels (_ārīq_), this is not\r\ndone. For not doing it there may be several reasons, one being that\r\nwater is not at all a necessity in cultivating crops and orchards.\r\nAutumn crops grow by the downpour of the rains themselves; and strange\r\nit is that spring crops grow even when no rain falls. To young trees\r\nwater is made to flow by means of buckets or a wheel. They are given\r\nwater constantly during two or three years; after which they need no\r\nmore. Some vegetables are watered constantly.\r\n\r\nIn Lāhor, Dībālpūr and those parts, people water by means of a wheel.\r\nThey make two circles of ropes long enough to suit the depth of the\r\nwell, fix strips of wood between them, and on these fasten pitchers. The\r\nropes with the wood and attached [Sidenote: Fol. 274.] pitchers are put\r\nover the well-wheel. At one end of the wheel-axle a second wheel is\r\nfixed, and close (_qāsh_) to it another on an upright axle. This last\r\nwheel the bullock turns; its teeth catch in the teeth of the second, and\r\nthus the wheel with the pitchers is turned. A trough is set where the\r\nwater empties from the pitchers and from this the water is conveyed\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nIn Āgra, Chandwār, Bīāna and those parts, again, people water with a\r\nbucket; this is a laborious and filthy way. At the well-edge they set up\r\na fork of wood, having a roller adjusted between the forks, tie a rope\r\nto a large bucket, put the rope over the roller, and tie its other end\r\nto the bullock. One person must drive the bullock, another empty the\r\nbucket. Every time the bullock turns after having drawn the bucket out\r\nof the well, that rope lies on the bullock-track, in pollution of urine\r\nand dung, before it descends again into the well. To some crops needing\r\nwater, men and women carry it by repeated efforts in pitchers.[1732]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Other particulars about Hindūstān._)\r\n\r\nThe towns and country of Hindūstān are greatly wanting in charm. Its\r\ntowns and lands are all of one sort; there are no walls to the orchards\r\n(_bāghāt_), and most places are on the dead level plain. Under the\r\nmonsoon-rains the banks of some of its rivers and torrents are worn into\r\ndeep channels, difficult and [Sidenote: Fol. 274b.] troublesome to pass\r\nthrough anywhere. In many parts of the plains thorny jungle grows,\r\nbehind the good defence of which the people of the _pargana_ become\r\nstubbornly rebellious and pay no taxes.\r\n\r\nExcept for the rivers and here and there standing-waters, there is\r\nlittle \"running-water\". So much so is this that towns and countries\r\nsubsist on the water of wells or on such as collects in tanks during the\r\nrains.\r\n\r\nIn Hindūstān hamlets and villages, towns indeed, are depopulated and set\r\nup in a moment! If the people of a large town, one inhabited for years\r\neven, flee from it, they do it in such a way that not a sign or trace of\r\nthem remains in a day or a day and a half.[1733] On the other hand, if\r\nthey fix their eyes on a place in which to settle, they need not dig\r\nwater-courses or construct dams because their crops are all\r\nrain-grown,[1734] and as the population of Hindūstān is unlimited, it\r\nswarms in. They make a tank or dig a well; they need not build houses or\r\nset up walls—_khas_-grass (_Andropogon muricatum_) abounds, wood is\r\nunlimited, huts are made, and straightway there is a village or a town!\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Fauna of Hindūstān:—Mammals._)\r\n\r\nThe elephant, which Hindūstānīs call _hāt(h)ī_, is one of the wild\r\nanimals peculiar to Hindūstān. It inhabits the (western?) borders of the\r\nKālpī country, and becomes more numerous in its wild state the further\r\neast one goes (in Kālpī?). From this tract it is that captured elephants\r\nare brought; in Karrah and [Sidenote: Fol. 275.] Mānikpūr\r\nelephant-catching is the work of 30 or 40 villages.[1735] People answer\r\n(_jawāb bīrūrlār_) for them direct to the exchequer.[1736] The elephant\r\nis an immense animal and very sagacious. If people speak to it, it\r\nunderstands; if they command anything from it, it does it. Its value is\r\naccording to its size; it is sold by measure (_qārīlāb_); the larger it\r\nis, the higher its price. People rumour that it is heard of in some\r\nislands as 10 _qārī_[1737] high, but in this tract it[1738] is not seen\r\nabove 4 or 5. It eats and drinks entirely with its trunk; if it lose the\r\ntrunk, it cannot live. It has two great teeth (tusks) in its upper jaw,\r\none on each side of its trunk; by setting these against walls and trees,\r\nit brings them down; with these it fights and does whatever hard tasks\r\nfall to it. People call these ivory (_`āj_, var. _ghāj_); they are\r\nhighly valued by Hindūstānīs. The elephant has no hair.[1739] It is much\r\nrelied on by Hindūstānīs, accompanying every troop of their armies. It\r\nhas some useful qualities:—it crosses great rivers with ease, carrying a\r\nmass of baggage, and three or four have gone dragging without trouble\r\nthe cart of the mortar (_qazān_) it takes four or five hundred men to\r\nhaul.[1740] But its stomach is large; one elephant eats the corn\r\n(_būghūz_) of two strings (_qiṯār_) of camels.[1741]\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceros is another. This also is a large animal, equal [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 275b.] in bulk to perhaps three buffaloes. The opinion current in\r\nthose countries (Tramontana) that it can lift an elephant on its horn,\r\nseems mistaken. It has a single horn on its nose, more than nine inches\r\n(_qārīsh_) long; one of two _qārīsh_ is not seen.[1742] Out of one large\r\nhorn were made a drinking-vessel[1743] and a dice-box, leaving over [the\r\nthickness of] 3 or 4 hands.[1744] The rhinoceros' hide is very thick;\r\nan arrow shot from a stiff bow, drawn with full strength right up to the\r\narm-pit, if it pierce at all, might penetrate 4 inches (_aīlīk_, hands).\r\nFrom the sides (_qāsh_) of its fore and hind legs,[1745] folds hang\r\nwhich from a distance look like housings thrown over it. It resembles\r\nthe horse more than it does any other animal.[1746] As the horse has a\r\nsmall stomach (appetite?), so has the rhinoceros; as in the horse a\r\npiece of bone (pastern?) grows in place of small bones (T. _āshūq_, Fr.\r\n_osselets_ (Zenker), knuckles), so one grows in the rhinoceros; as in\r\nthe horse's hand (_aīlīk_, Pers. _dast_) there is _kūmūk_ (or _gūmūk_, a\r\n_tibia_, or marrow), so there is in the rhinoceros.[1747] It is more\r\nferocious than the elephant and cannot be made obedient and submissive.\r\nThere are masses of it in the Parashāwar and Hashnagar jungles, so too\r\nbetween the Sind-river and the jungles of the Bhīra country. Masses\r\nthere are also on the banks of [Sidenote: Fol. 276.] the Sārū-river in\r\nHindūstān. Some were killed in the Parashāwar and Hashnagar jungles in\r\nour moves on Hindūstān. It strikes powerfully with its horn; men and\r\nhorses enough have been horned in those hunts.[1748] In one of them the\r\nhorse of a _chuhra_ (brave) named Maqṣūd was tossed a spear's-length,\r\nfor which reason the man was nick-named the rhino's aim\r\n(_maqṣūd-i-karg_).\r\n\r\nThe wild-buffalo[1749] is another. It is much larger than the (domestic)\r\nbuffalo and its horns do not turn back in the same way.[1750] It is a\r\nmightily destructive and ferocious animal.\r\n\r\nThe _nīla-gāū_ (blue-bull)[1751] is another. It may stand as high as a\r\nhorse but is somewhat lighter in build. The male is bluish-gray, hence,\r\nseemingly, people call it nīla-gāū. It has two rather small horns. On\r\nits throat is a tuft of hair, nine inches long; (in this) it resembles\r\nthe yak.[1752] Its hoof is cleft (_aīrī_) like the hoof of cattle. The\r\ndoe is of the colour of the _būghū-marāl_[1753]; she, for her part, has\r\nno horns and is plumper than the male.\r\n\r\nThe hog-deer (_kotah-pāīcha_) is another.[1754] It may be of the size of\r\nthe white deer (_āq kiyīk_). It has short legs, hence its name,\r\nlittle-legged. Its horns are like a _būghū_'s but smaller; like the\r\n_būghū_ it casts them every year. Being rather a poor runner, it does\r\nnot leave the jungle.\r\n\r\nAnother is a deer (_kiyīk_) after the fashion of the male deer (_aīrkākī\r\nhūna_) of the _jīrān_.[1755] Its back is black, its belly white, its\r\nhorns longer than the _hūna's_, but more crooked. A Hindūstānī\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 276b.] calls it _kalahara_,[1756] a word which may have\r\nbeen originally _kālā-haran_, black-buck, and which has been softened in\r\npronunciation to _kalahara_. The doe is light-coloured. By means of this\r\n_kalahara_ people catch deer; they fasten a noose (_ḥalqa_) on its\r\nhorns, hang a stone as large as a ball[1757] on one of its feet, so as\r\nto keep it from getting far away after it has brought about the capture\r\nof a deer, and set it opposite wild deer when these are seen. As these\r\n(_kalahara_) deer are singularly combative, advance to fight is made at\r\nonce. The two deer strike with their horns and push one another\r\nbackwards and forwards, during which the wild one's horns become\r\nentangled in the net that is fast to the tame one's. If the wild one\r\nwould run away, the tame one does not go; it is impeded also by the\r\nstone on its foot. People take many deer in this way; after capture they\r\ntame them and use them in their turn to take others;[1758] they also set\r\nthem to fight at home; the deer fight very well.\r\n\r\nThere is a smaller deer (_kiyīk_) on the Hindūstān hill-skirts, as large\r\nmay-be as the one year's lamb of the _arqārghalcha_ (_Ovis poli_).\r\n\r\nThe _gīnī-cow_[1759] is another, a very small one, perhaps as large as\r\nthe _qūchqār_ (ram) of those countries (Tramontana). Its flesh is very\r\ntender and savoury.\r\n\r\nThe monkey (_maimūn_) is another—a Hindūstānī calls it _bandar_. Of this\r\ntoo there are many kinds, one being what people [Sidenote: Fol. 277.]\r\ntake to those countries. The jugglers (_lūlī_) teach them tricks. This\r\nkind is in the mountains of Nūr-dara, in the skirt-hills of Safīd-koh\r\nneighbouring on Khaibar, and from there downwards all through Hindūstān.\r\nIt is not found higher up. Its hair is yellow, its face white, its tail\r\nnot very long.—Another kind, not found in Bajaur, Sawād and those parts,\r\nis much larger than the one taken to those countries (Tramontana). Its\r\ntail is very long, its hair whitish, its face quite black. It is in the\r\nmountains and jungles of Hindūstān.[1760]—Yet another kind is\r\ndistinguished (_būlā dūr_), quite black in hair, face and limbs.[1761]\r\n\r\nThe _nawal_ (_nūl_)[1762] is another. It may be somewhat smaller than\r\nthe _kīsh_. It climbs trees. Some call it the _mūsh-i-khūrma_\r\n(palm-rat). It is thought lucky.\r\n\r\nA mouse (T. _sīchqān_) people call _galāhrī_ (squirrel) is another. It\r\nis just always in trees, running up and down with amazing alertness and\r\nspeed.[1763]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Fauna of Hindūstān:—Birds._)[1764]\r\n\r\nThe peacock (Ar. _ṯāūs_) is one. It is a beautifully coloured and\r\nsplendid animal. Its form (_andām_) is not equal to its colouring and\r\nbeauty. Its body may be as large as the crane's (_tūrna_) but it is not\r\nso tall. On the head of both cock and hen are 20 to 30 feathers rising\r\nsome 2 or 3 inches high. The hen has neither colour nor beauty. The head\r\nof the cock has an iridescent collar (_ṯauq sūsanī_); its neck is of a\r\nbeautiful blue; [Sidenote: Fol. 277b.] below the neck, its back is\r\npainted in yellow, parrot-green, blue and violet colours. The\r\nflowers[1765] on its back are much the smaller; below the back as far as\r\nthe tail-tips are [larger] flowers painted in the same colours. The tail\r\nof some peacocks grows to the length of a man's extended arms.[1766] It\r\nhas a small tail under its flowered feathers, like the tail of other\r\nbirds; this ordinary tail and its primaries[1767] are red. It is in\r\nBajaur and Sawād and below them; it is not in Kunur [Kūnūr] and the\r\nLamghānāt or any place above them. Its flight is feebler than the\r\npheasant's (_qīrghāwal_); it cannot do more than make one or two short\r\nflights.[1768] On account of its feeble flight, it frequents the hills\r\nor jungles, which is curious, since jackals abound in the jungles it\r\nfrequents. What damage might these jackals not do to birds that trail\r\nfrom jungle to jungle, tails as long as a man's stretch (_qūlāch_)!\r\nHindūstānīs call the peacock _mor_. Its flesh is lawful food, according\r\nto the doctrine of Imām Abū Ḥanīfa; it is like that of the partridge and\r\nnot unsavoury, but is eaten with instinctive aversion, in the way\r\ncamel-flesh is.\r\n\r\nThe parrot (H. _ṯūṯī_) is another. This also is in Bajaur and countries\r\nlower down. It comes into Nīngnahār and the Lamghānāt in the heats when\r\nmulberries ripen; it is not there at other times. It is of many, many\r\nkinds. One sort is that which people carry into those (Tramontane)\r\ncountries. They [Sidenote: Fol. 278.] make it speak words.—Another sort\r\nis smaller; this also they make speak words. They call it the\r\njungle-parrot. It is numerous in Bajaur, Sawād and that neighbourhood,\r\nso much so that 5 or 6000 fly in one flock (_khail_). Between it and the\r\none first-named the difference is in bulk; in colouring they are just\r\none and the same.—Another sort is still smaller than the jungle-parrot.\r\nIts head is quite red, the top of its wings (_i.e._ the primaries) is\r\nred also; the tip of its tail for two hands'-thickness is\r\nlustrous.[1769] The head of some parrots of this kind is iridescent\r\n(_sūsanī_). It does not become a talker. People call it the Kashmīr\r\nparrot.—Another sort is rather smaller than the jungle-parrot; its beak\r\nis black; round its neck is a wide black collar; its primaries are red.\r\nIt is an excellent learner of words.—We used to think that whatever a\r\nparrot or a _shārak_ (_mīna_) might say of words people had taught it,\r\nit could not speak of any matter out of its own head. At this\r\njuncture[1770] one of my immediate servants Abū'l-qāsim _Jalāīr_,\r\nreported a singular thing to me. A parrot of this sort whose cage must\r\nhave been covered up, said, \"Uncover my face; I am stifling.\" And\r\nanother time when palkī bearers sat down to take breath, this parrot,\r\npresumably on hearing wayfarers pass by, said, \"Men are going past, are\r\nyou not going on?\" Let credit rest with the narrator,[1771] but\r\nnever-the-less, so long as a person has not heard with his own ears, he\r\nmay not believe!—Another kind is of a beautiful [Sidenote: Fol. 278b.]\r\nfull red; it has other colours also, but, as nothing is distinctly\r\nremembered about them, no description is made. It is a very beautiful\r\nbird, both in colour and form. People are understood to make this also\r\nspeak words.[1772] Its defect is a most unpleasant, sharp voice, like\r\nthe drawing of broken china on a copper plate.[1773]\r\n\r\nThe (P.) _shārak_[1774] is another. It is numerous in the Lamghānāt and\r\nabounds lower down, all over Hindūstān. Like the parrot, it is of many\r\nkinds.—The kind that is numerous in the Lamghānāt has a black head; its\r\nprimaries (_qānāt_) are spotted, its body rather larger and\r\nthicker[1775] than that of the (T.) _chūghūr-chūq_.[1776] People teach\r\nit to speak words.—Another kind they call _p:ndāwalī_[1777]; they bring\r\nit from Bengal; it is black all over and of much greater bulk than the\r\n_shārak_ (here, house-_mīna_). Its bill and foot are yellow and on each\r\near are yellow wattles which hang down and have a bad appearance.[1778]\r\nIt learns to speak well and clearly.—Another kind of _shārak_ is\r\nslenderer than the last and is red round the eyes. It does not learn to\r\nspeak. People call it the wood-_shārak_.[1779] Again, at the time when\r\n(934 AH.) I had made a bridge over Gang (Ganges), crossed it, and put my\r\nadversaries to flight, a kind of _shārak_ was seen, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Laknau and Aūd (Oude), for the first time, which had a white breast,\r\npiebald head, and black back. This kind does not learn to speak.[1780]\r\n\r\nThe _lūja_[1781] is another. This bird they call (Ar.) _bū-qalamūn_\r\n(chameleon) because, between head and tail, it has five or six changing\r\ncolours, resplendent (_barrāq_) like a pigeon's throat. [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n279.] It is about as large as the _kabg-i-darī_[1782] and seems to be\r\nthe _kabg-i-darī_ of Hindūstān. As the _kabg-i-darī_ moves (_yūrūr_) on\r\nthe heads (_kulah_) of mountains, so does this. It is in the Nijr-aū\r\nmountains of the countries of Kābul, and in the mountains lower down but\r\nit is not found higher up. People tell this wonderful thing about\r\nit:—When the birds, at the onset of winter, descend to the hill-skirts,\r\nif they come over a vineyard, they can fly no further and are taken. God\r\nknows the truth! The flesh of this bird is very savoury.\r\n\r\nThe partridge (_durrāj_)[1783] is another. This is not peculiar to\r\nHindūstān but is also in the _Garm-sīr_ countries[1784]; as however some\r\nkinds are only in Hindūstān, particulars of them are given here. The\r\n_durrāj_ (_Francolinus vulgaris_) may be of the same bulk as the\r\n_kīklīk_[1785]; the cock's back is the colour of the hen-pheasant\r\n(_qīrghāwal-ning māda-sī_); its throat and breast are black, with quite\r\nwhite spots.[1786] A red line comes down on both sides of both\r\neyes.[1787] It is named from its cry[1788] which is something like _Shir\r\ndāram shakrak_.[1789] It pronounces _shir_ short; _dāram shakrak_ it\r\nsays distinctly. Astarābād partridges are said to cry _Bāt mīnī tūtīlār_\r\n(Quick! they have caught me). The partridge of Arabia and those parts is\r\nunderstood to cry, _Bi'l_ _shakar tadawm al ni`am_ (with sugar pleasure\r\nendures)! The hen-bird has the colour of the young pheasant. These birds\r\nare found below Nijr-aū.—Another kind is called _kanjāl_. Its bulk may\r\nbe that of the one already described. Its voice is very like that of the\r\n_kīklīk_ but much shriller. There is little [Sidenote: Fol. 279b.]\r\ndifference in colour between the cock and hen. It is found in\r\nParashāwar, Hashnagar and countries lower down, but not higher up.\r\n\r\nThe _p(h)ūl-paikār_[1790] is another. Its size may be that of the\r\n_kabg-i-darī_; its shape is that of the house-cock, its colour that of\r\nthe hen. From forehead (_tūmāgh_) to throat it is of a beautiful colour,\r\nquite red. It is in the Hindūstān mountains.\r\n\r\nThe wild-fowl (_ṣaḥrāī-tāūgh_)[1791] is another. It flies like a\r\npheasant, and is not of all colours as house-fowl are. It is in the\r\nmountains of Bajaur and lower down, but not higher up.\r\n\r\nThe _chīlsī_ (or _jīlsī_)[1792] is another. In bulk it equals the\r\n_p(h)ūl-paikār_ but the latter has the finer colouring. It is in the\r\nmountains of Bajaur.\r\n\r\nThe _shām_[1793] is another. It is about as large as a house-fowl; its\r\ncolour is unique (_ghair mukarrar_).[1794] It also is in the mountains\r\nof Bajaur.\r\n\r\nThe quail (P. _būdana_) is another. It is not peculiar to Hindūstān but\r\nfour or five kinds are so.—One is that which goes to our countries\r\n(Tramontana), larger and more spreading than the (Hindūstān)\r\nquail.[1795]—Another kind[1796] is smaller than the one first named. Its\r\nprimaries and tail are reddish. It flies in flocks like the _chīr_\r\n(_Phasianus Wallichii_).—Another kind is smaller than that which goes to\r\nour countries and is darker on throat [Sidenote: Fol. 280.] and\r\nbreast.[1797]—Another kind goes in small numbers to Kābul; it is very\r\nsmall, perhaps a little larger than the yellow wag-tail\r\n(_qārcha_)[1798]; they call it _qūrātū_ in Kābul.\r\n\r\nThe Indian bustard (P. _kharchāl_)[1799] is another. It is about as\r\nlarge as the (T.) _tūghdāq_ (_Otis tarda_, the great bustard), and seems\r\nto be the _tūghdāq_ of Hindūstān.[1800] Its flesh is delicious; of some\r\nbirds the leg is good, of others, the wing; of the bustard all the meat\r\nis delicious and excellent.\r\n\r\nThe florican (P. _charz_)[1801] is another. It is rather less than the\r\n_tūghdīrī_ (_houbara_)[1802]; the cock's back is like the _tūghdīrī's_,\r\nand its breast is black. The hen is of one colour.\r\n\r\nThe Hindūstān sand-grouse (T. _bāghrī-qarā_)[1803] is another. It is\r\nsmaller and slenderer than the _bāghrī-qarā_ [_Pterocles arenarius_] of\r\nthose countries (Tramontana). Also its cry is sharper.\r\n\r\nOf the birds that frequent water and the banks of rivers, one is the\r\n_dīng_,[1804] an animal of great bulk, each wing measuring a _qūlāch_\r\n(fathom). It has no plumage (_tūqī_) on head or neck; a thing like a bag\r\nhangs from its neck; its back is black; its breast is white. It goes\r\nsometimes to Kābul; one year people brought one they had caught. It\r\nbecame very tame; if meat were thrown to it, it never failed to catch\r\nit in its bill. Once it swallowed a six-nailed shoe, another time a\r\nwhole fowl, wings [Sidenote: Fol. 280b.] and feathers, all right down.\r\n\r\nThe _sāras_ (_Grus antigone_) is another. Turks in Hindūstān call it\r\n_tīwa-tūrnā_ (camel-crane). It may be smaller than the _dīng_ but its\r\nneck is rather longer. Its head is quite red.[1805] People keep this\r\nbird at their houses; it becomes very tame.\r\n\r\nThe _mānek_[1806] is another. In stature it approaches the _sāras_, but\r\nits bulk is less. It resembles the _lag-lag_ (_Ciconia alba_, the white\r\nstork) but is much larger; its bill is larger and is black. Its head is\r\niridescent, its neck white, its wings partly-coloured; the tips and\r\nborder-feathers and under parts of the wings are white, their middle\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nAnother stork (_lag-lag_) has a white neck and all other parts black. It\r\ngoes to those countries (Tramontana). It is rather smaller than the\r\n_lag-lag_ (_Ciconia alba_). A Hindūstānī calls it _yak-rang_ (one\r\ncolour?).\r\n\r\nAnother stork in colour and shape is exactly like the storks that go to\r\nthose countries. Its bill is blacker and its bulk much less than the\r\n_lag-lag_'s (_Ciconia alba_).[1807]\r\n\r\nAnother bird resembles the grey heron (_aūqār_) and the _lag-lag_; but\r\nits bill is longer than the heron's and its body smaller than the white\r\nstork's (_lag-lag_).\r\n\r\nAnother is the large _buzak_[1808] (black ibis). In bulk it may equal\r\nthe buzzard (Turkī, _sār_). The back of its wings is white. It has a\r\nloud cry.\r\n\r\nThe white _buzak_[1809] is another. Its head and bill are black.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 281.] It is much larger than the one that goes to those\r\ncountries,[1810] but smaller than the Hindūstān _buzak_.[1811]\r\n\r\nThe _gharm-pāī_[1812] (spotted-billed duck) is another. It is larger\r\nthan the _sūna būrchīn_[1813] (mallard). The drake and duck are of one\r\ncolour. It is in Hashnagar at all seasons, sometimes it goes into the\r\nLamghānāt. Its flesh is very savoury.\r\n\r\nThe _shāh-murgh_ (_Sarcidiornis melanonotus_, comb duck or _nukta_) is\r\nanother. It may be a little smaller than a goose. It has a swelling on\r\nits bill; its back is black; its flesh is excellent eating.\r\n\r\nThe _zummaj_ is another. It is about as large as the _būrgūt_ (_Aquila\r\nchrysaetus_, the golden eagle).\r\n\r\nThe (T.) _ālā-qārgha_ of Hindūstān is another (_Corvus cornix_, the pied\r\ncrow). This is slenderer and smaller than the _ālā-qārgha_ of those\r\ncountries (Tramontana). Its neck is partly white.\r\n\r\nAnother Hindūstān bird resembles the crow (T. _qārcha_, _C. splendens_)\r\nand the magpie (Ar. _`aqqa_). In the Lamghānāt people call it the\r\njungle-bird (P. _murgh-i-jangal_).[1814] Its head and breast are black;\r\nits wings and tail reddish; its eye quite red. Having a feeble flight,\r\nit does not come out of the jungle, whence its name.\r\n\r\nThe great bat (P. _shapara_)[1815] is another. People call it (Hindī)\r\n_chumgādur_. It is about as large as the owl (T. _yāpālāq_, _Otus\r\nbrachyotus_), and has a head like a puppy's. When it is thinking of\r\nlodging for the night on a tree, it takes hold of a branch, turns\r\nhead-downwards, and so remains. It has much singularity.\r\n\r\nThe magpie (Ar. _`aqqa_) is another. People call it (H.?) _matā_\r\n(_Dendrocitta rufa_, the Indian tree-pie). It may be somewhat less than\r\nthe _`aqqa_ (_Pica rustica_), which moreover is pied black and white,\r\nwhile the _matā_ is pied brown and black.[1816]\r\n\r\nAnother is a small bird, perhaps of the size of the (T.)\r\n_sāndūlāch_.[1817] [Sidenote: Fol. 281b.] It is of a beautiful red with\r\na little black on its wings.\r\n\r\nThe _karcha_[1818] is another; it is after the fashion of a swallow (T.\r\n_qārlūghāch_), but much larger and quite black.\r\n\r\nThe _kūīl_[1819] (_Eudynamys orientalis_, the koel) is another. It may\r\nbe as large as the crow (P. _zāg_) but is much slenderer. It has a kind\r\nof song and is understood to be the bulbul of Hindūstān. Its honour with\r\nHindūstānīs is as great as is the bulbul's. It always stays in\r\nclosely-wooded gardens.\r\n\r\nAnother bird is after the fashion of the (Ar.) _shiqarrāk_ (_Cissa\r\nchinensis_, the green-magpie). It clings to trees, is perhaps as large\r\nas the green-magpie, and is parrot-green (_Gecinus striolatus_, the\r\nlittle green-woodpecker?).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Fauna of Hindūstān:—Aquatic animals._)\r\n\r\nOne is the water-tiger (P. _shīr-ābī_, _Crocodilus palustris_).[1820]\r\nThis is in the standing-waters. It is like a lizard (T. _gīlās_).[1821]\r\nPeople say it carries off men and even buffaloes.\r\n\r\nThe (P.) _siyāh-sār_ (black-head) is another. This also is like a\r\nlizard. It is in all rivers of Hindūstān. One that was taken and brought\r\nin was about 4-5 _qārī_ (_cir._ 13 feet) long and as thick perhaps as a\r\nsheep. It is said to grow still larger. Its snout is over half a yard\r\nlong. It has rows of small teeth in its upper and lower jaws. It comes\r\nout of the water and sinks into the mud (_bātā_).\r\n\r\nThe (Sans.) _g[h]aṛīāl_ (_Gavialus gangeticus_) is another.[1822] It is\r\nsaid to grow large; many in the army saw it in the Sarū (Gogra) river.\r\nIt is said to take people; while we were on that river's banks (934-935\r\nA.H.), it took one or two slave-women (_dādūk_), and it took three or\r\nfour camp-followers between Ghāzīpūr and Banāras. In that neighbourhood\r\nI saw one but from a distance only and not quite clearly.\r\n\r\nThe water-hog (P. _khūk-ābī_, _Platanista gangetica_, the porpoise) is\r\nanother. This also is in all Hindūstān rivers. It comes up suddenly out\r\nof the water; its head appears and disappears; it [Sidenote: Fol. 282.]\r\ndives again and stays below, shewing its tail. Its snout is as long as\r\nthe _siyāh-sār's_ and it has the same rows of small teeth. Its head and\r\nthe rest of its body are fish-like. When at play in the water, it looks\r\nlike a water-carrier's bag (_mashak_). Water-hogs, playing in the Sarū,\r\nleap right out of the water; like fish, they never leave it.\r\n\r\nAgain there is the _kalah_ (or _galah_)-fish [_bāligh_].[1823] Two bones\r\neach about 3 inches (_aīlīk_) long, come out in a line with its ears;\r\nthese it shakes when taken, producing an extraordinary noise, whence,\r\nseemingly, people have called it _kalah_ [or _galah_].\r\n\r\nThe flesh of Hindūstān fishes is very savoury; they have no odour\r\n(_aīd_) or tiresomeness.[1824] They are surprisingly active. On one\r\noccasion when people coming, had flung a net across a stream, leaving\r\nits two edges half a yard above the water, most fish passed by leaping a\r\nyard above it. In many rivers are little fish which fling themselves a\r\nyard or more out of the water if there be harsh [Sidenote: Fol. 282b.]\r\nnoise or sound of feet.\r\n\r\nThe frogs of Hindūstān, though otherwise like those others (Tramontane),\r\nrun 6 or 7 yards on the face of the water.[1825]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Vegetable products of Hindūstān: Fruits._)\r\n\r\nThe mango (P. _anbah_) is one of the fruits peculiar to Hindūstān.\r\nHindūstānīs pronounce the _b_ in its name as though no vowel followed it\r\n(_i.e._ Sans. _anb_);[1826] this being awkward to utter, some people\r\ncall the fruit [P.] _naghzak_[1827] as Khwāja Khusrau does:—\r\n\r\n   _Naghzak-i mā_ [var. _khẉash_] _naghz-kun-i būstān,\r\n   Naghztarīn mewa_ [var. _na`mat_]_-i-Hindūstān_.[1828]\r\n\r\nMangoes when good, are very good, but, many as are eaten, few are\r\nfirst-rate. They are usually plucked unripe and ripened in the house.\r\nUnripe, they make excellent condiments (_qātīq_), are good also\r\npreserved in syrup.[1829] Taking it altogether, the mango is the best\r\nfruit of Hindūstān. Some so praise it as to give it preference over all\r\nfruits except the musk-melon (T. _qāwūn_), but such praise outmatches\r\nit. It resembles the _kārdī_ peach.[1830] It ripens in the rains. It is\r\neaten in two ways: one is to squeeze it to a pulp, make a hole in it,\r\nand suck out the juice,—the other, to peel and eat it like the _kārdī_\r\npeach. Its tree grows very large[1831] and has a leaf somewhat\r\nresembling the peach-tree's. The trunk is ill-looking and ill-shaped,\r\nbut in Bengāl and Gujrāt is heard of as growing handsome (_khūb_).[1832]\r\n\r\nThe plantain (Sans. _kelā_, _Musa sapientum_) is another.[1833] An\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 283.] `Arab calls it _mauz_.[1834] Its tree is not very\r\ntall, indeed is not to be called a tree, since it is something between a\r\ngrass and a tree. Its leaf is a little like that of the\r\n_amān-qarā_[1835] but grows about 2 yards (_qārī_) long and nearly\r\none broad. Out of the middle of its leaves rises, heart-like, a bud\r\nwhich resembles a sheep's heart. As each leaf (petal) of this bud\r\nexpands, there grows at its base a row of 6 or 7 flowers which become\r\nthe plantains. These flowers become visible with the lengthening of the\r\nheart-like shoot and the opening of the petals of the bud. The tree is\r\nunderstood to flower once only.[1836] The fruit has two pleasant\r\nqualities, one that it peels easily, the other that it has neither stone\r\nnor fibre.[1837] It is rather longer and thinner than the egg-plant (P.\r\n_bādanjān_; _Solanum melongena_). It is not very sweet; the Bengāl\r\nplantain (_i.e._ _chīnī-champa_) is, however, said to be very sweet.\r\nThe plantain is a very good-looking tree, its broad, broad, leaves of\r\nbeautiful green having an excellent appearance.\r\n\r\nThe _anblī_ (H. _imlī_, _Tamarindus indica_, the tamarind) is another.\r\nBy this name (_anblī_) people call the _khurmā-i-hind_ (Indian\r\ndate-tree).[1838] It has finely-cut leaves (leaflets), precisely like\r\nthose of the (T.) _būīā_, except that they are not so finely-cut.[1839]\r\nIt is a very good-looking tree, giving dense shade. It grows wild in\r\nmasses too.\r\n\r\nThe (Beng.) _mahuwā_ (_Bassia latifolia_) is another.[1840] People call\r\nit also (P.) _gul-chikān_ (or _chigān_, distilling-flower). This also is\r\na very large tree. Most of the wood in the houses of Hindūstānīs\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 283b.] is from it. Spirit (_`araq_) is distilled from\r\nits flowers,[1841] not only so, but they are dried and eaten like\r\nraisins, and from them thus dried, spirit is also extracted. The dried\r\nflowers taste just like _kishmish_;[1842] they have an ill-flavour. The\r\nflowers are not bad in their natural state[1843]; they are eatable. The\r\n_mahuwā_ grows wild also. Its fruit is tasteless, has rather a large\r\nseed with a thin husk, and from this seed, again,[1844] oil is\r\nextracted.\r\n\r\nThe mimusops (Sans. _khirnī_, _Mimusops kauki_) is another. Its tree,\r\nthough not very large, is not small. The fruit is yellow and thinner\r\nthan the red jujube (T. _chīkdā_, _Elæagnus angustifolia_). It has just\r\nthe grape's flavour, but a rather bad after-taste; it is not bad,\r\nhowever, and is eatable. The husk of its stone is thin.\r\n\r\nThe (Sans.) _jāman_ (_Eugenia jambolana_)[1845] is another. Its leaf,\r\nexcept for being thicker and greener, is quite like the willow's (T.\r\n_tāl_). The tree does not want for beauty. Its fruit is like a black\r\ngrape, is sourish, and not very good.\r\n\r\nThe (H.) _kamrak_ (Beng. _kamrunga_, _Averrhoa carambola_) is another.\r\nIts fruit is five-sided, about as large as the _`ain-ālū_[1846] and some\r\n3 inches long. It ripens to yellow; gathered unripe, it is very bitter;\r\ngathered ripe, its bitterness has become sub-acid, not bad, not wanting\r\nin pleasantness.[1847]\r\n\r\nThe jack-fruit (H. _kadhil_, B. _kanthal_, _Artocarpus integrifolia_) is\r\nanother.[1848] This is a fruit of singular form and flavour; it looks\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 284.] like a sheep's stomach stuffed and made into a\r\nhaggis (_gīpa_);[1849] and it is sickeningly-sweet. Inside it are\r\nfilbert-like stones[1850] which, on the whole, resemble dates, but are\r\nround, not long, and have softer substance; these are eaten. The\r\njack-fruit is very adhesive; for this reason people are said to oil\r\nmouth and hands before eating of it. It is heard of also as growing, not\r\nonly on the branches of its tree, but on trunk and root too.[1851] One\r\nwould say that the tree was all hung round with haggises.[1852]\r\n\r\nThe monkey-jack (H. _badhal_, B. _burhul_, _Artocarpus lacoocha_) is\r\nanother. The fruit may be of the size of a quince (var. apple). Its\r\nsmell is not bad.[1853] Unripe it is a singularly tasteless and\r\nempty[1854] thing; when ripe, it is not so bad. It ripens soft, can be\r\npulled to pieces and eaten anywhere, tastes very much like a rotten\r\nquince, and has an excellent little austere flavour.\r\n\r\nThe lote-fruit (Sans. _ber_, _Zizyphus jujuba_) is another. Its Persian\r\nname is understood to be _kanār_.[1855] It is of several kinds: of one\r\nthe fruit is larger than the plum (_ālūcha_)[1856]; another is shaped\r\nlike the Ḥusainī grape. Most of them are not very good; we saw one in\r\nBāndīr (Gūālīār) that was really good. The lote-tree sheds its leaves\r\nunder the Signs _S̤aur_ and _Jauzā_ (Bull and Twins), burgeons under\r\n_Saraṯān_ and _Asad_ (Crab and Lion) which are the true\r\nrainy-season,—then becoming fresh and green, and it ripens its fruit\r\nunder _Dalū_ and _Ḥaut_ (Bucket _i.e._ Aquarius, and Fish).\r\n\r\nThe (Sans.) _karaūndā_ (_Carissa carandas_, the corinda) is another. It\r\ngrows in bushes after the fashion of the (T.) _chīka_ of our\r\ncountry.[1857] but the _chīka_ grows on mountains, the _karaūndā_ on the\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 284b.] plains. In flavour it is like the rhubarb\r\nitself,[1858] but is sweeter and less juicy.\r\n\r\nThe (Sans.) _pānīyālā_ (_Flacourtia cataphracta_)[1859] is another. It\r\nis larger than the plum (_ālūcha_) and like the red-apple unripe.[1860]\r\nIt is a little austere and is good. The tree is taller than the\r\npomegranate's; its leaf is like that of the almond-tree but smaller.\r\n\r\nThe (H.) _gūlar_ (_Ficus glomerata_, the clustered fig)[1861] is\r\nanother. The fruit grows out of the tree-trunk, resembles the fig (P.\r\n_anjīr_), but is singularly tasteless.\r\n\r\nThe (Sans.) _āmlā_ (_Phyllanthus emblica_, the myrobalan-tree) is\r\nanother. This also is a five-sided fruit.[1862] It looks like the\r\nunblown cotton-pod. It is an astringent and ill-flavoured thing, but\r\nconfiture made of it is not bad. It is a wholesome fruit. Its tree is of\r\nexcellent form and has very minute leaves.\r\n\r\nThe (H.) _chirūnjī_ (_Buchanania latifolia_)[1863] is another. This tree\r\nhad been understood to grow in the hills, but I knew later about it,\r\nbecause there were three or four clumps of it in our gardens. It is much\r\nlike the _mahuwā_. Its kernel is not bad, a thing between the walnut and\r\nthe almond, not bad! rather smaller than the pistachio and round; people\r\nput it in custards (P. _pālūda_) and sweetmeats (Ar. _ḥalwa_).\r\n\r\nThe date-palm (P. _khurmā_, _Phœnix dactylifera_) is another. This is\r\nnot peculiar to Hindūstān, but is here described because it is not in\r\nthose countries (Tramontana). It grows in Lamghān also.[1864] Its\r\nbranches (_i.e._ leaves) grow from just one place at its top; its leaves\r\n(_i.e._ leaflets) grow on both sides of the branches (midribs) from neck\r\n(_būīn_) to tip; its trunk is rough and ill-coloured; [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n285.] its fruit is like a bunch of grapes, but much larger. People say\r\nthat the date-palm amongst vegetables resembles an animal in two\r\nrespects: one is that, as, if an animal's head be cut off, its life is\r\ntaken, so it is with the date-palm, if its head is cut off, it dries\r\noff; the other is that, as the offspring of animals is not produced\r\nwithout the male, so too with the date-palm, it gives no good fruit\r\nunless a branch of the male-tree be brought into touch with the\r\nfemale-tree. The truth of this last matter is not known (to me). The\r\nabove-mentioned head of the date-palm is called its cheese. The tree so\r\ngrows that where its leaves come out is cheese-white, the leaves\r\nbecoming green as they lengthen. This white part, the so-called cheese,\r\nis tolerable eating, not bad, much like the walnut. People make a wound\r\nin the cheese, and into this wound insert a leaf(let), in such a way\r\nthat all liquid flowing from the wound runs down it.[1865] The tip of\r\nthe leaflet is set over the mouth of a pot suspended to the tree in such\r\na way that it collects whatever liquor is yielded by the wound. This\r\nliquor is rather pleasant if drunk at once; if drunk after two or three\r\ndays, people say it is quite exhilarating (_kaifīyat_). Once when I had\r\ngone to visit Bārī,[1866] and made an [Sidenote: Fol. 285b.] excursion\r\nto the villages on the bank of the Chaṃbal-river, we met in with people\r\ncollecting this date-liquor in the valley-bottom. A good deal was drunk;\r\nno hilarity was felt; much must be drunk, seemingly, to produce a little\r\ncheer.\r\n\r\nThe coco-nut palm (P. _nārgīl_, _Cocos nucifera_) is another. An `Arab\r\ngives it Arabic form[1867] and says _nārjīl_; Hindūstān people say\r\n_nālīr_, seemingly by popular error.[1868] Its fruit is the Hindī-nut\r\nfrom which black spoons (_qarā qāshūq_) are made and the larger ones of\r\nwhich serve for guitar-bodies. The coco-palm has general resemblance to\r\nthe date-palm, but has more, and more glistening leaves. Like the\r\nwalnut, the coco-nut has a green outer husk; but its husk is of fibre on\r\nfibre. All ropes for ships and boats and also cord for sewing boat-seams\r\nare heard of as made from these husks. The nut, when stripped of its\r\nhusk, near one end shews a triangle of hollows, two of which are solid,\r\nthe third a nothing (_būsh_), easily pierced. Before the kernel forms,\r\nthere is fluid inside; people pierce the soft hollow and drink this; it\r\ntastes like date-palm cheese in solution, and is not bad.\r\n\r\nThe (Sans.) _tāṛ_ (_Borassus flabelliformis_, the Palmyra-palm) is\r\nanother. Its branches (_i.e._ leaves) also are quite at its top. Just as\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 286.] with the date-palm, people hang a pot on it, take\r\nits juice and drink it. They call this liquor _tāṛī_;[1869] it is said\r\nto be more exhilarating than date liquor. For about a yard along its\r\nbranches (_i.e._ leaf-stems)[1870] there are no leaves; above this, at\r\nthe tip of the branch (stem), 30 or 40 open out like the spread palm of\r\nthe hand, all from one place. These leaves approach a yard in length.\r\nPeople often write Hindī characters on them after the fashion of account\r\nrolls (_daftar yūsūnlūq_).\r\n\r\nThe orange (Ar. _nāranj_, _Citrus aurantium_) and orange-like fruits are\r\nothers of Hindūstān.[1871] Oranges grow well in the Lamghānāt, Bajaur\r\nand Sawād. The Lamghānāt one is smallish, has a navel,[1872] is very\r\nagreeable, fragile and juicy. It is not at all like the orange of\r\nKhurāsān and those parts, being so fragile that many spoil before\r\nreaching Kābul from the Lamghānāt which may be 13-14 _yīghāch_ (65-70\r\nmiles), while the Astarābād orange, by reason of its thick skin and\r\nscant juice, carries with [Sidenote: Fol. 286b.] less damage from there\r\nto Samarkand, some 270-280 _yīghāch_.[1873] The Bajaur orange is about\r\nas large as a quince, very juicy and more acid than other oranges.\r\nKhwāja Kalān once said to me, \"We counted the oranges gathered from a\r\nsingle tree of this sort in Bajaur and it mounted up to 7,000.\" It had\r\nbeen always in my mind that the word _nāranj_ was an Arabic form;[1874]\r\nit would seem to be really so, since every-one in Bajaur and Sawād says\r\n(P.) _nārang_.[1875]\r\n\r\nThe lime (B. _līmū_, _C. acida_) is another. It is very plentiful, about\r\nthe size of a hen's egg, and of the same shape. If a person poisoned\r\ndrink the water in which its fibres have been boiled, danger is\r\naverted.[1876]\r\n\r\nThe citron (P. _turunj_,[1877] _C. medica_) is another of the fruits\r\nresembling the orange. Bajaurīs and Sawādīs call it _bālang_ and hence\r\ngive the name _bālang-marabbā_ to its marmalade (_marabbā_) confiture.\r\nIn Hindūstān people call the _turunj bajaurī_.[1878] There are two kinds\r\nof _turunj_: one is sweet, flavourless and nauseating, of no use for\r\neating but with peel that may be good for marmalade; it has the same\r\nsickening sweetness as the Lamghānāt _turunj_; the other, that of\r\nHindūstān and Bajaur, is acid, quite deliciously acid, and makes\r\nexcellent sherbet, well-flavoured, and wholesome drinking. Its size may\r\nbe that of the Khusrawī melon; it has a thick skin, wrinkled and uneven,\r\nwith one end thinner and beaked. It is of a deeper yellow than the\r\norange (_nāranj_). Its tree has no trunk, is rather low, grows in\r\nbushes, and has a larger [Sidenote: Fol. 287.] leaf than the orange.\r\n\r\nThe _sangtāra_[1879] is another fruit resembling the orange (_nāranj_).\r\nIt is like the citron (_turunj_) in colour and form, but has both ends\r\nof its skin level;[1880] also it is not rough and is somewhat the\r\nsmaller fruit. Its tree is large, as large as the apricot (_aūrūq_),\r\nwith a leaf like the orange's. It is a deliciously acid fruit, making a\r\nvery pleasant and wholesome sherbet. Like the lime it is a powerful\r\nstomachic, but not weakening like the orange (_nāranj_).\r\n\r\nThe large lime which they call (H.) _gal-gal_[1881] in Hindūstān is\r\nanother fruit resembling the orange. It has the shape of a goose's egg,\r\nbut unlike that egg, does not taper to the ends. Its skin is smooth like\r\nthe _sangtāra's_; it is remarkably juicy.\r\n\r\nThe (H.) _jānbīrī_ lime[1882] is another orange-like fruit. It is\r\norange-shaped and, though yellow, not orange-yellow. It smells like the\r\ncitron (_turunj_); it too is deliciously acid.\r\n\r\nThe (Sans.) _sadā-fal_ (_phal_)[1883] is another orange-like fruit. This\r\nis pear-shaped, colours like the quince, ripens sweet, but not to the\r\nsickly-sweetness of the orange (_nāranj_).\r\n\r\nThe _amrd-fal_ (sic. Ḥai. MS.—Sans. _amrit-phal_)[1884] is another\r\norange-like fruit.\r\n\r\nThe lemon (H. _karnā_, _C. limonum_) is another fruit resembling the\r\norange (_nāranj_); it may be as large as the _gal-gal_ and is also acid.\r\n\r\nThe (Sans.) _amal-bīd_[1885] is another fruit resembling the orange.\r\nAfter three years (in Hindūstān), it was first seen to-day.[1886] They\r\nsay a needle melts away if put inside it,[1887] either from its acidity\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 287b.] or some other property. It is as acid, perhaps,\r\nas the citron and lemon (_turunj_ and _līmū_).[1888]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Vegetable products of Hindūstān:—Flowers._)\r\n\r\nIn Hindūstān there is great variety of flowers. One is the (D.) _jāsūn_\r\n(_Hibiscus rosa sinensis_), which some Hindūstānīs call (Hindī)\r\n_gaẕhal_.[1889] *It is not a grass (_giyāh_); its tree (is in stems like\r\nthe bush of the red-rose; it) is rather taller than the bush of the\r\nred-rose.[1890]* The flower of the _jāsūn_ is fuller in colour than that\r\nof the pomegranate, and may be of the size of the red-rose, but, the\r\nred-rose, when its bud has grown, opens simply, whereas, when the\r\n_jāsūn_-bud opens, a stem on which other petals grow, is seen like a\r\nheart amongst its expanded petals. Though the two are parts of the one\r\nflower, yet the outcome of the lengthening and thinning of that\r\nstem-like heart of the first-opened petals gives the semblance of two\r\nflowers.[1891] It is not a common matter. The beautifully coloured\r\nflowers look very well on the tree, but they do not last long; they\r\nfade in just one day. The _jāsūn_ blossoms very well through the four\r\nmonths of the rains; it seems indeed to flower all through the year;\r\nwith this profusion, however, it gives no perfume.\r\n\r\nThe (H.) _kanīr_ (_Nerium odorum_, the oleander)[1892] is another. It\r\ngrows both red and white. Like the peach-flower, it is five petalled. It\r\nis like the peach-bloom (in colour?), but opens 14 or 15 flowers from\r\none place, so that seen from a distance, they look like one great\r\nflower. The oleander-bush is taller than the rose-bush. The red oleander\r\nhas a sort of scent, faint and agreeable. (Like the _jāsūn_,) it also\r\nblooms well and profusely in the [Sidenote: Fol. 288.] rains, and it\r\nalso is had through most of the year.\r\n\r\nThe (H.) (_kīūrā_) (_Pandanus odoratissimus_, the screw-pine) is\r\nanother.[1893] It has a very agreeable perfume.[1894] Musk has the\r\ndefect of being dry; this may be called moist musk—a very agreeable\r\nperfume. The tree's singular appearance notwithstanding, it has flowers\r\nperhaps 1-1/2 to 2 _qārīsh_ (13-1/2 to 18 inches) long. It has long\r\nleaves having the character of the reed (P.) _gharau_[1895] and having\r\nspines. Of these leaves, while pressed together bud-like, the outer ones\r\nare the greener and more spiny; the inner ones are soft and white. In\r\namongst these inner leaves grow things like what belongs to the middle\r\nof a flower, and from these things comes the excellent perfume. When the\r\ntree first comes up not yet shewing any trunk, it is like the bush\r\n(_būta_) of the male-reed,[1896] but with wider and more spiny leaves.\r\nWhat serves it for a trunk is very shapeless, its roots remaining shewn.\r\n\r\nThe (P.) _yāsman_ (jasmine) is another; the white they call (B.)\r\n_champa_.[1897] It is larger and more strongly scented than our\r\n_yāsman_-flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. Seasons of the year._)\r\n\r\nAgain:—whereas there are four seasons in those countries,[1898] there\r\nare three in Hindūstān, namely, four months are summer; four are the\r\nrains; four are winter. The beginning of their months is from the\r\nwelcome of the crescent-moons.[1899] Every three years they add a month\r\nto the year; if one had been added to the rainy season, the next is\r\nadded, three years later, to the winter months, the next, in the same\r\nway, to the hot months. This is their mode of intercalation.[1900]\r\n(_Chait_, _Baisākh_, _Jeṭh_ and [Sidenote: Fol. 288b.] _Asāṛh_) are the\r\nhot months, corresponding with the Fish, (Ram, Bull and Twins; _Sāwan_,\r\n_Bhādoṅ_, _Kū,ār_ and _Kātik_) are the rainy months, corresponding with\r\nthe Crab, (Lion, Virgin and Balance; _Aghan_, _Pūs_, _Māgh_ and\r\n_Phālgun_) are the cold months, corresponding with the Scorpion,\r\n(Archer, Capricorn, and Bucket or Aquarius).\r\n\r\nThe people of Hind, having thus divided the year into three seasons of\r\nfour months each, divide each of those seasons by taking from each, the\r\ntwo months of the force of the heat, rain,[1901] and cold. Of the hot\r\nmonths the last two, _i.e. Jeṭh_ and _Asāṛh_ are the force of the heat;\r\nof the rainy months, the first two, _i.e. Sāwan_ and _Bhādoṅ_ are the\r\nforce of the rains; of the cold season, the middle two, _i.e. Pūs_ and\r\n_Māgh_ are the force of the cold. By this classification there are six\r\nseasons in Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. Days of the week._)\r\n\r\nTo the days also they have given names:—[1902] (_Sanīchar_ is Saturday;\r\n_Rabī-bār_ is Sunday; _Som-wār_ is Monday; _Mangal-wār_ is Tuesday;\r\n_Budh-bār_ is Wednesday; _Brihaspat-bār_ is Thursday; _Shukr-bār_ is\r\nFriday).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. Divisions of time._)\r\n\r\n   [Sidenote: Fol. 289.] (_Author's note on the daqīqa._) The\r\n   _daqīqa_ is about as long as six repetitions of the _Fātiḥa_\r\n   with the _Bismillāh_, so that a day-and-night is as long as\r\n   8640 repetitions of the _Fātiḥa_ with the _Bismillāh._\r\n\r\nAs in our countries what is known by the (Turkī) term _kīcha-gūndūz_ (a\r\nday-and-night, nycthemeron) is divided into 24 parts, each called an\r\nhour (Ar. _sā`at_), and the hour is divided into 60 parts, each called a\r\nminute (Ar. _daqīqa_), so that a day-and-night consists of 1440\r\nminutes,—so the people of Hind divide the night-and-day into 60 parts,\r\neach called a (S.) _g'harī_.[1903] They also divide the night into four\r\nand the day into four, calling each part a (S.) _pahr_ (watch) which in\r\nPersian is a _pās_. A watch and watchman (_pās u pāsbān_) had been heard\r\nabout (by us) in those countries (Transoxania), but without these\r\nparticulars. Agreeing with the division into watches, a body of\r\n_g'harīālīs_[1904] is chosen and appointed in all considerable towns of\r\nHindūstān. They cast a broad brass (plate-) thing,[1905] perhaps as\r\nlarge as a tray (_ṯabaq_) and about two hands'-thickness; this they call\r\na _g'harīāl_ and hang up in a high place (_bīr buland yīr-dā_). Also\r\nthey have a vessel perforated at the bottom like an hour-cup[1906] and\r\nfilling in one _g'harī_ (_i.e._ 24 minutes). The _g'harīālīs_ put this\r\ninto water and wait till it fills. For example, they will put the\r\nperforated [Sidenote: Fol. 289b.] cup into water at day-birth; when it\r\nfills the first time, they strike the gong once with their mallets; when\r\na second time, twice, and so on till the end of the watch. They announce\r\nthe end of a watch by several rapid blows of their mallets. After these\r\nthey pause; then strike once more, if the first day-watch has ended,\r\ntwice if the second, three times if the third, and four times if the\r\nfourth. After the fourth day-watch, when the night-watches begin, these\r\nare gone through in the same way. It used to be the rule to beat the\r\nsign of a watch only when the watch ended; so that sleepers chancing to\r\nwake in the night and hear the sound of a third or fourth _g'harī_,\r\nwould not know whether it was of the second or third night-watch. I\r\ntherefore ordered that at night or on a cloudy day the sign of the watch\r\nshould be struck after that of the _g'harī_, for example, that after\r\nstriking the third _g'harī_ of the first night-watch, the _g'harīālīs_\r\nwere to pause and then strike the sign of the watch, in order to make it\r\nknown that this third _g'harī_ was of the first night-watch,—and that\r\nafter striking four _g'harīs_ of the third night-watch, they should\r\npause and then strike the sign of the third watch, in order to make it\r\nknown that this fourth _g'harī_ was of the third night-watch. It did\r\nvery well; anyone happening to wake in the night and hear the gong,\r\nwould know what _g'harī_ of what watch of night it was.\r\n\r\nAgain, they divide the _g'harī_ into 60 parts, each part being called a\r\n_pal_;[1907] by this each night-and-day will consist of 3,500 _pals_.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 290.]\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on the pal._) They say the length of a _pal_\r\n   is the shutting and opening of the eyelids 60 times, which in\r\n   a night-and-day would be 216,000 shuttings and openings of the\r\n   eyes. Experiment shews that a _pal_ is about equal to 8\r\n   repetitions of the _Qul-huwa-allāh_[1908] and _Bismillāh_;\r\n   this would be 28,000 repetitions in a night-and-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_q. Measures._)\r\n\r\nThe people of Hind have also well-arranged measures:—[1909] 8 _ratīs_ =\r\n1 _māsha_; 4 _māsha_ = 1 _tānk_ = 32 _ratīs_; 5 _māsha_ = 1 _miṣqāl_ =\r\n40 _ratīs_; 12 _māsha_ = 1 _tūla_ = 96 _ratīs_; 14 _tūla_ = 1 _ser_.\r\n\r\nThis is everywhere fixed:—40 _ser_ = 1 _mānbān_; 12 _mānbān_ = 1\r\n_mānī_; 100 _mānī_ they call a _mīnāsa_.[1910]\r\n\r\nPearls and jewels they weigh by the _tānk_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_r. Modes of reckoning._)\r\n\r\nThe people of Hind have also an excellent mode of reckoning: 100,000\r\nthey call a _lak_; 100 _laks_, a _krūr_; 100 _krūrs_, an _arb_; 100\r\n_arbs_, 1 _karb_; 100 _karb's_, 1 _nīl_; 100 _nīls_, 1 _padam_; 100\r\n_padams_, 1 _sāng_. The fixing of such high reckonings as these is proof\r\nof the great amount of wealth in Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_s. Hindū inhabitants of Hindūstān._)\r\n\r\nMost of the inhabitants of Hindūstān are pagans; they call a pagan a\r\nHindū. Most Hindūs believe in the transmigration of souls. All artisans,\r\nwage-earners, and officials are Hindūs. In our countries dwellers in the\r\nwilds (_i.e._ nomads) get tribal names; [Sidenote: Fol. 290b.] here the\r\nsettled people of the cultivated lands and villages get tribal\r\nnames.[1911] Again:—every artisan there is follows the trade that has\r\ncome down to him from forefather to forefather.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_t. Defects of Hindūstān._)\r\n\r\nHindūstān is a country of few charms. Its people have no good looks; of\r\nsocial intercourse, paying and receiving visits there is none; of genius\r\nand capacity none; of manners none; in handicraft and work there is no\r\nform or symmetry, method or quality; there are no good horses, no good\r\ndogs, no grapes, musk-melons or first-rate fruits, no ice or cold water,\r\nno good bread or cooked food in the _bāzārs_, no Hot-baths, no Colleges,\r\nno candles, torches or candlesticks.\r\n\r\nIn place of candle and torch they have a great dirty gang they call\r\nlamp-men (_diwatī_), who in the left hand hold a smallish wooden tripod\r\nto one corner of which a thing like the top of a candlestick is fixed,\r\nhaving a wick in it about as thick as the thumb. In the right hand they\r\nhold a gourd, through a narrow slit made in which, oil is let trickle in\r\na thin thread when the wick needs it. Great people keep a hundred or two\r\nof these lamp-men. This is the Hindūstān substitute for lamps and\r\ncandlesticks! If their rulers and begs have work at night needing\r\ncandles, these dirty lamp-men bring these lamps, go close up and\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 291.] there stand.\r\n\r\nExcept their large rivers and their standing-waters which flow in\r\nravines or hollows (there are no waters). There are no running-waters in\r\ntheir gardens or residences (_`imāratlār_).[1912] These residences have\r\nno charm, air (_hawā_), regularity or symmetry.\r\n\r\nPeasants and people of low standing go about naked. They tie on a thing\r\ncalled _lungūtā_,[1913] a decency-clout which hangs two spans below the\r\nnavel. From the tie of this pendant decency-clout, another clout is\r\npassed between the thighs and made fast behind. Women also tie on a\r\ncloth (_lung_), one-half of which goes round the waist, the other is\r\nthrown over the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_u. Advantages of Hindūstān._)\r\n\r\nPleasant things of Hindūstān are that it is a large country and has\r\nmasses of gold and silver. Its air in the Rains is very fine. Sometimes\r\nit rains 10, 15 or 20 times a day; torrents pour down all at once and\r\nrivers flow where no water had been. While it rains and through the\r\nRains, the air is remarkably fine, not to be surpassed for healthiness\r\nand charm. The fault is that the air becomes very soft and damp. A bow\r\nof those (Transoxanian) countries after going through the Rains in\r\nHindūstān, may not be drawn even; it is ruined; not only the bow,\r\neverything is [Sidenote: Fol. 291b.] affected, armour, book, cloth, and\r\nutensils all; a house even does not last long. Not only in the Rains\r\nbut also in the cold and the hot seasons, the airs are excellent; at\r\nthese times, however, the north-west wind constantly gets up laden with\r\ndust and earth. It gets up in great strength every year in the heats,\r\nunder the Bull and Twins when the Rains are near; so strong and carrying\r\nso much dust and earth that there is no seeing one another. People call\r\nthis wind Darkener of the Sky (H. _āndhī_). The weather is hot under the\r\nBull and Twins, but not intolerably so, not so hot as in Balkh and\r\nQandahār and not for half so long.\r\n\r\nAnother good thing in Hindūstān is that it has unnumbered and endless\r\nworkmen of every kind. There is a fixed caste (_jam`ī_) for every sort\r\nof work and for every thing, which has done that work or that thing from\r\nfather to son till now. Mullā Sharaf, writing in the _Z̤afar-nāma_ about\r\nthe building of Tīmūr Beg's Stone Mosque, lays stress on the fact that\r\non it 200 stone-cutters worked, from Āẕarbāījān, Fars, Hindūstān and\r\nother countries. But 680 men worked daily on my buildings in Āgra and of\r\nĀgra stone-cutters only; while 1491 stone-cutters worked daily on my\r\nbuildings in Āgra, Sīkrī, Bīāna, Dūlpūr, Gūālīār and Kūīl. In [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 292.] the same way there are numberless artisans and workmen of\r\nevery sort in Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_v. Revenues of Hindūstān._)\r\n\r\nThe revenue of the countries now held by me (935 AH.-1528 AD.) from\r\nBhīra to Bihār is 52 _krūrs_,[1914] as will be known in detail from the\r\nfollowing summary.[1915] Eight or nine _krūrs_ of this are from\r\nparganas of rāīs and rājas who, as obedient from of old, receive\r\nallowance and maintenance.\r\n\r\nREVENUES OF HINDŪSTĀN FROM WHAT HAS SO FAR COME UNDER THE VICTORIOUS\r\nSTANDARDS\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------+---------+-----+----------\r\n              Sarkārs.            | Krūrs.  |Laks.| Tankas.\r\n  --------------------------------+---------+-----+----------\r\n  Trans-sutluj:--Bhīra,           |         |     |\r\n    Lāhūr, Sīālkūt,               |         |     |\r\n    Dībālpūr, etc.                |    3    |  33 |15,989\r\n  Sihrind                         |    1    |  29 |31,985\r\n  Ḥiṣār-fīrūza                    |    1    |  30 |75,174\r\n  The capital Dihlī and           |         |     |\r\n    Mīān-dū-āb                    |    3    |  69 |50,254\r\n  Mīwāt, not included in          |         |     |\r\n    Sikandar's time               |    1    |  69 |81,000\r\n  Bīāna                           |    1    |  44 |14,930 [Sidenote:\r\n  Āgra                            |         |  29 |76,919 Fol. 292b.]\r\n  Mīān-wilāyat (Midlands)         |    2    |  91 |    19\r\n  Gūālīār                         |    2    |  23 |57,450\r\n  Kālpī and Seho[n.]da            |         |     |\r\n    (Seondhā)                     |    4    |  28 |55,950\r\n  Qanauj                          |    1    |  36 |63,358\r\n  Saṃbhal                         |    1    |  38 |44,000\r\n  Laknūr and Baksar               |    1    |  39 |82,433\r\n  Khairābād                       |         |  12 |65,000\r\n  Aūd (Oude) and Bahraj           |         |     |\r\n    (Baraich)                     |    1    |  17 | 1,369 [Sidenote:\r\n  Jūnpūr                          |    4    |  ·0 |88,333 Fol. 293.]\r\n  Karra and Mānikpūr              |    1    |  63 |27,282\r\n  Bihār                           |    4    |   5 |60,000\r\n  Sarwār                          |    1    |  55 |17,506-1/2\r\n  Sāran                           |    1    |  10 |18,373\r\n  Champāran                       |    1    |  90 |86,060\r\n  Kandla                          |         |  43 |30,300\r\n  Tirhut from Rāja                |         |     |\r\n    Rup-narāīn's tribute,         |         |     |\r\n    silver                        |         |   2 |55,000\r\n            black (i.e. copper)   |         |  27 |50,000\r\n  Rantanbhūr from Būlī,           |         |     |\r\n    Chātsū, and Malarna           |         |  20 |?00,000\r\n  Nagūr                           |   --    |  -- |  --\r\n  Rāja Bikrāmajīt in              |         |     |\r\n    Rantanbhūr                    |   --    |  -- |  --\r\n  Kalanjarī                       |   --    |  -- |  --\r\n  Rāja Bīr-sang-deo (or,          |         |     |\r\n    Sang only)                    |   --    |  -- |  --\r\n  Rāja Bikam-deo                  |   --    |  -- |  --\r\n  Rāja Bikam-chand                |   --    |  -- |  --\r\n  --------------------------------+---------+-----+----------\r\n\r\n[1916] So far as particulars and details about the land and people of\r\nthe country of Hindūstān have become definitely known, they have been\r\nnarrated and described; whatever matters worthy of record may come to\r\nview hereafter, I shall write down.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NARRATIVE RESUMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Distribution of treasure in Āgra._)[1917]\r\n\r\n(_May 12th_) On Saturday the 29th[1918] of Rajab the examination and\r\ndistribution of the treasure were begun. To Humāyūn were given 70 laks\r\nfrom the Treasury, and, over and above this, a treasure house was\r\nbestowed on him just as it was, without ascertaining and writing down\r\nits contents. To some begs 10 laks were given, 8, 7, or 6 to\r\nothers.[1919] Suitable money-gifts were bestowed from the Treasury on\r\nthe whole army, to every tribe there was, Afghān, Hazāra, `Arab, Bīlūch\r\n_etc._ to each according to its position. Every trader and student,\r\nindeed every man who had come with the army, took ample portion and\r\nshare of bounteous gift and largess. To those not with the army went a\r\nmass of treasure in gift and largess, as for instance, 17 laks to\r\nKāmran, 15 laks to Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā, while to `Askarī, Hindāl and\r\nindeed to the whole various train of relations and younger\r\nchildren[1920] went masses of red and white (gold and silver), of\r\nplenishing, jewels and slaves.[1921] Many gifts went to the begs and\r\nsoldiery on that side (Tramontana). Valuable gifts (_saughāt_)\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 294.] were sent for the various relations in Samarkand,\r\nKhurāsān, Kāshghar and `Irāq. To holy men belonging to Samarkand and\r\nKhurāsān went offerings vowed to God (_nuẕūr_); so too to Makka and\r\nMadīna. We gave one _shāhrukhi_ for every soul in the country of Kābul\r\nand the valley-side[1922] of Varsak, man and woman, bond and free, of\r\nage or non-age.[1923]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Disaffection to Bābur._)\r\n\r\nOn our first coming to Āgra, there was remarkable dislike and hostility\r\nbetween its people and mine, the peasantry and soldiers running away in\r\nfear of our men. Dilhī and Āgra excepted, not a fortified town but\r\nstrengthened its defences and neither was in obedience nor submitted.\r\nQāsim Saṃbhalī was in Saṃbhal; Niẕām Khān was in Bīāna; in Mīwāt was\r\nḤasan Khān Mīwātī himself, impious mannikin! who was the sole leader of\r\nthe trouble and mischief.[1924] Muḥammad _Zaitun_ was in Dūlpūr; Tātār\r\nKhān _Sārang-khānī_[1925] was in Gūālīār; Ḥusain Khān _Nuḥānī_ was in\r\nRāprī; Quṯb Khān was in Itāwa (Etāwa); `Ālam Khān (_Kālpī_) was in\r\nKālpī. Qanauj and the other side of Gang (Ganges) was all held by\r\nAfghāns in independent hostility,[1926] such as Naṣīr Khān _Nuḥānī_,\r\nMa`rūf _Farmūlī_ and a crowd of other amīrs. These had been in rebellion\r\nfor three or four years before Ibrāhīm's death and when I defeated him,\r\nwere holding Qanauj and the whole country beyond it. At the present time\r\nthey were lying two or three marches on our side of Qanauj and had made\r\nBihār Khān the son of Daryā Khān _Nuḥānī_ their _pādshāh_, under the\r\nstyle Sulṯān Muḥammad. [Sidenote: Fol. 294b.] Marghūb the slave was in\r\nMahāwīn (_Muttra_?); he remained there, thus close, for some time but\r\ncame no nearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Discontent in Bābur's army._)\r\n\r\nIt was the hot-season when we came to Āgra. All the inhabitants\r\n(_khalāīq_) had run away in terror. Neither grain for ourselves nor corn\r\nfor our horses was to be had. The villages, out of hostility and hatred\r\nto us had taken to thieving and highway-robbery; there was no moving on\r\nthe roads. There had been no chance since the treasure was distributed\r\nto send men in strength into the parganas and elsewhere. Moreover the\r\nyear was a very hot one; violent pestilential winds struck people down\r\nin heaps together; masses began to die off.\r\n\r\nOn these accounts the greater part of the begs and best braves became\r\nunwilling to stay in Hindūstān, indeed set their faces for leaving it.\r\nIt is no reproach to old and experienced begs if they speak of such\r\nmatters; even if they do so, this man (Bābur) has enough sense and\r\nreason to get at what is honest or what is mutinous in their\r\nrepresentations, to distinguish between loss and gain. But as this man\r\nhad seen his task whole, for himself, when he resolved on it, what taste\r\nwas there in their reiterating that things should be done differently?\r\nWhat recommends the expression of distasteful opinions by men of little\r\nstanding [Sidenote: Fol. 295.] (_kīchīk karīm_)? Here is a curious\r\nthing:—This last time of our riding out from Kābul, a few men of little\r\nstanding had just been made begs; what I looked for from them was that\r\nif I went through fire and water and came out again, they would have\r\ngone in with me unhesitatingly, and with me have come out, that wherever\r\nI went, there at my side would they be,—not that they would speak\r\nagainst my fixed purpose, not that they would turn back from any task or\r\ngreat affair on which, all counselling, all consenting, we had resolved,\r\nso long as that counsel was not abandoned. Badly as these new begs\r\nbehaved, Secretary Aḥmadī and Treasurer Walī behaved still worse. Khwāja\r\nKalān had done well in the march out from Kābul, in Ibrāhīm's defeat and\r\nuntil Āgra was occupied; he had spoken bold words and shewn ambitious\r\nviews. But a few days after the capture of Āgra, all his views\r\nchanged,—the one zealous for departure at any price was Khwāja\r\nKalān.[1927]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Bābur calls a council._)\r\n\r\nWhen I knew of this unsteadiness amongst (my) people, I summoned all the\r\nbegs and took counsel. Said I, \"There is no supremacy and grip on the\r\nworld without means and resources; without lands and retainers\r\nsovereignty and command (_pādshāhlīq u amīrlīq_) are impossible. By the\r\nlabours of several years, by encountering hardship, by long travel, by\r\nflinging myself and the army into battle, and by deadly slaughter, we,\r\nthrough God's [Sidenote: Fol. 295b.] grace, beat these masses of enemies\r\nin order that we might take their broad lands. And now what force\r\ncompels us, what necessity has arisen that we should, without cause,\r\nabandon countries taken at such risk of life? Was it for us to remain in\r\nKābul, the sport of harsh poverty? Henceforth, let no well-wisher of\r\nmine speak of such things! But let not those turn back from going who,\r\nweak in strong persistence, have set their faces to depart!\" By these\r\nwords, which recalled just and reasonable views to their minds, I made\r\nthem, willy-nilly, quit their fears.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Khwāja Kalān decides to leave Hindūstān._)\r\n\r\nAs Khwāja Kalān had no heart to stay in Hindūstān, matters were settled\r\nin this way:—As he had many retainers, he was to convoy the gifts, and,\r\nas there were few men in Kābul and Ghaznī, was to keep these places\r\nguarded and victualled. I bestowed on him Ghaznī, Girdīz and the Sulṯān\r\nMas`ūdī Hazāra, gave also the Hindūstān _pargana_ of G'hūram,[1928]\r\nworth 3 or 4 _laks_. It was settled for Khwāja Mīr-i-mīrān also to go to\r\nKābul; the gifts were put into his immediate charge, under the custody\r\nof Mullā Ḥasan the banker (_ṣarrāf_) and Tūka[1929] _Hindū_.\r\n\r\nLoathing Hindūstān, Khwāja Kalān, when on his way, had the following\r\ncouplet inscribed on the wall of his residence [Sidenote: Fol. 296.]\r\n(_`imāratī_) in Dihlī:—\r\n\r\n   If safe and sound I cross the Sind,\r\n   Blacken my face ere I wish for Hind!\r\n\r\nIt was ill-mannered in him to compose and write up this partly-jesting\r\nverse while I still stayed in Hind. If his departure\r\n\r\ncaused me one vexation, such a jest doubled it.[1930] I composed the\r\nfollowing off-hand verse, wrote it down and sent it to him:—\r\n\r\n   Give a hundred thanks, Bābur, that the generous Pardoner\r\n   Has given thee Sind and Hind and many a kingdom.\r\n   If thou (_i.e._ the Khwāja) have not the strength for their heats,\r\n   If thou say, \"Let me see the cold side (_yūz_),\" Ghaznī is there.[1931]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Accretions to Bābur's force._)\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, Mullā Apāq was sent into Kūl with royal letters of\r\nfavour for the soldiers and quiver-wearers (_tarkash-band_) of that\r\nneighbourhood. Shaikh Gūran (G'hūran)[1932] came trustfully and loyally\r\nto do obeisance, bringing with him from 2 to 3,000 soldiers and\r\nquiver-wearers from Between-two-waters (_Mīān-dū-āb_).\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on Mullā Apāq._) Formerly he had been in a\r\n   very low position indeed, but two or three years before this\r\n   time, had gathered his elder and younger brethren into a\r\n   compact body and had brought them in (to me), together with\r\n   the Aūrūq-zāī and other Afghāns of the banks of the Sind.\r\n\r\nYūnas-i-`alī when on his way from Dihlī to Āgra[1933] had lost his way a\r\nlittle and got separated from Humāyūn; he then met in with `Alī Khān\r\n_Farmūlī's_ sons and train,[1934] had a small affair with them, took\r\nthem prisoners and brought them in. Taking advantage of this, one of the\r\nsons thus captured was sent to his [Sidenote: Fol. 296b.] father in\r\ncompany with Daulat-qadam _Turk's_ son Mīrzā _Mughūl_ who conveyed royal\r\nletters of favour to `Alī Khān. At this time of break-up, `Alī Khān had\r\ngone to Mīwāt; he came to me when Mīrzā _Mughūl_ returned, was\r\npromoted, and given valid(?) _parganas_[1935] worth 25 laks.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Action against the rebels of the East._)\r\n\r\nSl. Ibrāhīm had appointed several amīrs under Muṣṯafa _Farmūlī_ and\r\nFīrūz Khān _Sārang-khānī_, to act against the rebel amīrs of the East\r\n(_Pūrab_). Muṣṯafa had fought them and thoroughly drubbed them, giving\r\nthem more than one good beating. He dying before Ibrāhīm's defeat, his\r\nyounger brother Shaikh Bāyazīd—Ibrāhīm being occupied with a momentous\r\nmatter[1936]—had led and watched over his elder brother's men. He now\r\ncame to serve me, together with Fīrūz Khān, Maḥmūd Khān _Nuḥānī_ and\r\nQāẓī Jīā. I shewed them greater kindness and favour than was their\r\nclaim; giving to Fīrūz Khān 1 _krūr_, 46 _laks_ and 5000 _tankas_ from\r\nJūnpūr, to Shaikh Bāyazīd 1 _krūr_, 48 _laks_ and 50,000 _tankas_ from\r\nAūd (Oude), to Maḥmūd Khān 90 _laks_ and 35,000 _tankas_ from Ghāzīpūr,\r\nand to Qāẓī Jīā 20 _laks_.[1937]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Gifts made to various officers._)\r\n\r\nIt was a few days after the `Īd of Shawwāl[1938] that a large party was\r\nheld in the pillared-porch of the domed building standing in the middle\r\nof Sl. Ibrāhīm's private apartments. At this party there were bestowed\r\non Humāyūn a _chār-qab_,[1939] a sword-belt,[1940] a _tīpūchāq_ horse\r\nwith saddle mounted in gold; on Chīn-tīmūr Sulṯān, Mahdī Khwāja and\r\nMuḥammad Sl. Mīrzā _chār-qabs_, sword-belts and dagger-belts; and to the\r\nbegs and [Sidenote: Fol. 297.] braves, to each according to his rank,\r\nwere given sword-belts, dagger-belts, and dresses of honour, in all to\r\nthe number specified below:—\r\n\r\n    2 items (_rā's_) of _tīpūchāq_ horses with saddles.\r\n   16 items (_qabẓa_) of poinards, set with jewels, etc.\r\n    8 items (_qabẓa_) of purpet over-garments.\r\n    2 items (_tob_) of jewelled sword-belts.\r\n   —— items (_qabẓa_) of broad daggers (_jamd'kar_) set with jewels.\r\n   25 items of jewelled hangers (_khanjar_).\r\n   —— items of gold-hilted Hindī knives (_kārd_).\r\n   51 pieces of purpet.\r\n\r\nOn the day of this party it rained amazingly, rain falling thirteen\r\ntimes. As outside places had been assigned to a good many people, they\r\nwere drowned out (_gharaq_).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Of various forts and postings._)\r\n\r\nSamāna (in Patīāla) had been given to Muḥammadī Kūkūldāsh and it had\r\nbeen arranged for him to make swift descent on Saṃbal (Saṃbhal), but\r\nSaṃbal was now bestowed on Humāyūn, in addition to his guerdon of\r\nḤiṣār-fīrūza, and in his service was Hindū Beg. To suit this, therefore,\r\nHindū Beg was sent to make the incursion in Muḥammadī's place, and with\r\nhim Kitta Beg, Bābā _Qashqa's_ (brother) Malik Qāsim and his elder and\r\nyounger brethren, Mullā Apāq and Shaikh Gūran (G'hūran) with the\r\nquiver-wearers from Between-two-waters (_Mīān-dū-āb_). [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n297b.] Three or four times a person had come from Qāsim _Saṃbalī_,\r\nsaying, \"The renegade Bīban is besieging Saṃbal and has brought it to\r\nextremity; come quickly.\" Bīban, with the array and the preparation\r\n(_hayāt_) with which he had deserted us,[1941] had gone skirting the\r\nhills and gathering up Afghān and Hindūstānī deserters, until, finding\r\nSaṃbal at this juncture ill-garrisoned, he laid siege to it. Hindū Beg\r\nand Kitta Beg and the rest of those appointed to make the incursion, got\r\nto the Ahār-passage[1942] and from there sent ahead Bābā _Qashqa's_\r\nMalik Qāsim with his elder and younger brethren, while they themselves\r\nwere getting over the water. Malik Qāsim crossed, advanced swiftly with\r\nfrom 100 to 150 men—his own and his brethren's—and reached Saṃbal by the\r\nMid-day Prayer. Bīban for his part came out of his camp in array. Malik\r\nQāsim and his troop moved rapidly forward, got the fort in their rear,\r\nand came to grips. Bīban could make no stand; he fled. Malik Qāsim cut\r\noff the heads of part of his force, took many horses, a few elephants\r\nand a mass of booty. Next day when the other begs arrived, Qāsim\r\n_Saṃbalī_ came out and saw them, but not liking to surrender the fort,\r\nmade them false pretences. One day Shaikh Gūran (G'hūran) and Hindū Beg\r\nhaving talked the matter over with them, got Qāsim _Saṃbalī_ out to the\r\npresence of the begs, and took men of ours into the fort. They brought\r\nQāsim's wife and dependents safely out, and sent Qāsim (to Court).[1943]\r\n\r\nQalandar the foot-man was sent to Niẕām Khān in Bīāna with royal letters\r\nof promise and threat; with these was sent [Sidenote: Fol. 298.] also\r\nthe following little off-hand (Persian) verse:—[1944]\r\n\r\n   Strive not with the Turk, o Mīr of Bīāna!\r\n   His skill and his courage are obvious.\r\n   If thou come not soon, nor give ear to counsel,—\r\n   What need to detail (_bayān_) what is obvious?\r\n\r\nBīāna being one of the famous forts of Hindūstān, the senseless\r\nmannikin, relying on its strength, demanded what not even its strength\r\ncould enforce. Not giving him a good answer, we ordered siege apparatus\r\nto be looked to.\r\n\r\nBābā Qulī Beg was sent with royal letters of promise and threat to\r\nMuḥammad _Zaitūn_ (in Dūlpūr); Muḥammad _Zaitūn_ also made false\r\nexcuses.\r\n\r\nWhile we were still in Kābul, Rānā Sangā had sent an envoy to testify to\r\nhis good wishes and to propose this plan: \"If the honoured Pādshāh will\r\ncome to near Dihlī from that side, I from this will move on Āgra.\" But I\r\nbeat Ibrāhīm, I took Dihlī and Āgra, and up to now that Pagan has given\r\nno sign soever of moving. After a while he went and laid siege to\r\nKandār[1945] a fort in which was Makan's son, Ḥasan by name. This\r\nḤasan-of-Makan had sent a person to me several times, but had not shewn\r\nhimself. We had not been able to detach [Sidenote: Fol. 298b.]\r\nreinforcement for him because, as the forts round-about—Atāwa (Etāwa),\r\nDūlpūr, and Bīāna—had not yet surrendered, and the Eastern Afghāns were\r\nseated with their army in obstinate rebellion two or three marches on\r\nthe Āgra side of Qanūj, my mind was not quite free from the whirl and\r\nstrain of things close at hand. Makan's Ḥasan therefore, becoming\r\nhelpless, had surrendered Kandār two or three months ago.\r\n\r\nḤusain Khān (_Nuḥānī_) became afraid in Rāprī, and he abandoning it, it\r\nwas given to Muḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang_.\r\n\r\nTo Quṯb Khān in Etāwa royal letters of promise and threat had been sent\r\nseveral times, but as he neither came and saw me, nor abandoned Etāwa\r\nand got away, it was given to Mahdī Khwāja and he was sent against it\r\nwith a strong reinforcement of begs and household troops under the\r\ncommand of Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā, Sl. Muḥammad _Dūldāī_, Muḥammad `Alī\r\n_Jang-jang_ and `Abdu'l-`azīz the Master of the Horse. Qanūj was given\r\nto Sl. Muḥammad _Dūldāī_; he was also (as mentioned) appointed against\r\nEtāwa; so too were Fīrūz Khān, Maḥmūd Khān, Shaikh Bāyazīd and Qāẓī Jīā,\r\nhighly favoured commanders to whom Eastern _parganas_ had been given.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 299.] Muḥammad _Zaitūn_, who was seated in Dūlpūr,\r\ndeceived us and did not come. We gave Dūlpūr to Sl. Junaid _Barlās_ and\r\nreinforced him by appointing `Ādil Sulṯān, Muḥammadī Kūkūldāsh, Shāh\r\nManṣūr _Barlās_, Qūtlūq-qadam, Treasurer Walī, Jān Beg, `Abdu'l-lāh,\r\nPīr-qulī, and Shāh Ḥasan _Yāragī_ (or _Bāragī_), who were to attack\r\nDūlpūr, take it, make it over to Sl. Junaid _Barlās_ and advance on\r\nBīāna.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Plan of operations adopted._)\r\n\r\nThese armies appointed, we summoned the Turk amīrs[1946] and the\r\nHindūstān amīrs, and tossed the following matters in amongst them:—The\r\nvarious rebel amīrs of the East, that is to say, those under Nāṣir Khān\r\n_Nuḥānī_ and Ma`rūf _Farmūlī_, have crossed Gang (Ganges) with 40 to\r\n50,000 men, taken Qanūj, and now lie some three miles on our side of the\r\nriver. The Pagan Rānā Sangā has captured Kandār and is in a hostile and\r\nmischievous attitude. The end of the Rains is near. It seems expedient\r\nto move either against the rebels or the Pagan, since the task of the\r\nforts near-by is easy; when the great foes are got rid of, what road\r\nwill remain open for the rest? Rānā Sangā is thought not to be the equal\r\nof the rebels.\r\n\r\nTo this all replied unanimously, \"Rānā Sangā is the most distant, and it\r\nis not known that he will come nearer; the enemy who is closest at hand\r\nmust first be got rid of. We are for riding against the rebels.\" Humāyūn\r\nthen represented, [Sidenote: Fol. 299b.] \"What need is there for the\r\nPādshāh to ride out? This service I will do.\" This came as a pleasure to\r\nevery-one; the Turk and Hind amīrs gladly accepted his views; he was\r\nappointed for the East. A Kābulī of Aḥmad-i-qāsim's was sent galloping\r\noff to tell the armies that had been despatched against Dūlpūr to join\r\nHumāyūn at Chandwār;[1947] also those sent against Etāwa under Mahdī\r\nKhwāja and Muḥammad Sl. M. were ordered to join him.\r\n\r\n(_August 21st_) Humāyūn set out on Thursday the 13th of Ẕū'l-qa´da,\r\ndismounted at a little village called Jilīsīr (Jalesar) some 3 _kurohs_\r\nfrom Āgra, there stayed one night, then moved forward march by march.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Khwāja Kalān's departure._)\r\n\r\n(_August 28th_) On Thursday the 20th of this same month, Khwāja Kalān\r\nstarted for Kābul.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Of gardens and pleasaunces._)\r\n\r\nOne of the great defects of Hindūstān being its lack of\r\nrunning-waters,[1948] it kept coming to my mind that waters should be\r\nmade to flow by means of wheels erected wherever I might settle down,\r\nalso that grounds should be laid out in an orderly and symmetrical way.\r\nWith this object in view, we crossed the Jūn-water to look at\r\ngarden-grounds a few days after entering Āgra. Those grounds were so bad\r\nand unattractive that we traversed them with a hundred disgusts and\r\nrepulsions. So ugly and displeasing were they, that the idea of making a\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 300.] Chār-bāgh in them passed from my mind, but needs\r\nmust! as there was no other land near Āgra, that same ground was taken\r\nin hand a few days later.\r\n\r\nThe beginning was made with the large well from which water comes for\r\nthe Hot-bath, and also with the piece of ground where the\r\ntamarind-trees and the octagonal tank now are. After that came the large\r\ntank with its enclosure; after that the tank and _tālār_[1949] in front\r\nof the outer(?) residence[1950]; after that the private-house\r\n(_khilwat-khāna_) with its garden and various dwellings; after that the\r\nHot-bath. Then in that charmless and disorderly Hind, plots of\r\ngarden[1951] were seen laid out with order and symmetry, with suitable\r\nborders and parterres in every corner, and in every border rose and\r\nnarcissus in perfect arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Construction of a chambered-well._)\r\n\r\nThree things oppressed us in Hindūstān, its heat, its violent winds, its\r\ndust. Against all three the Bath is a protection, for in it, what is\r\nknown of dust and wind? and in the heats it is so chilly that one is\r\nalmost cold. The bath-room in which the heated tank is, is altogether of\r\nstone, the whole, except for the _īzāra_ (dado?) of white stone, being,\r\npavement and roofing, of red Bīāna stone.\r\n\r\nKhalīfa also and Shaikh Zain, Yūnas-i-`alī and whoever got [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 300b.] land on that other bank of the river laid out regular and\r\norderly gardens with tanks, made running-waters also by setting up\r\nwheels like those in Dīpālpūr and Lāhor. The people of Hind who had\r\nnever seen grounds planned so symmetrically and thus laid out, called\r\nthe side of the Jūn where (our) residences were, Kābul.\r\n\r\nIn an empty space inside the fort, which was between Ibrāhīm's residence\r\nand the ramparts, I ordered a large chambered-well (_wāīn_) to be made,\r\nmeasuring 10 by 10,[1952] a large well with a flight of steps, which in\r\nHindūstān is called a _wāīn_.[1953] This well was begun before the\r\nChār-bāgh[1954]; they were busy digging it in the true Rains (_`aīn\r\nbīshkāl_, Sāwan and Bhadon); it fell in several times and buried the\r\nhired workmen; it was finished after the Holy Battle with Rānā Sangā, as\r\nis stated in the inscription on the stone that bears the chronogram of\r\nits completion. It is a complete _wāīn_, having a three-storeyed house\r\nin it. The lowest storey consists of three rooms, each of which opens on\r\nthe descending steps, at intervals of three steps from one another. When\r\nthe water is at its lowest, it is one step below the bottom chamber;\r\nwhen it rises in the Rains, it sometimes goes into the top storey. In\r\nthe middle storey an inner chamber has been excavated which connects\r\nwith the domed building in which the bullock turns the well-wheel. The\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 301.] top storey is a single room, reached from two\r\nsides by 5 or 6 steps which lead down to it from the enclosure\r\noverlooked from the well-head. Facing the right-hand way down, is the\r\nstone inscribed with the date of completion. At the side of this well is\r\nanother the bottom of which may be at half the depth of the first, and\r\ninto which water comes from that first one when the bullock turns the\r\nwheel in the domed building afore-mentioned. This second well also is\r\nfitted with a wheel, by means of which water is carried along the\r\nramparts to the high-garden. A stone building (_tāshdīn `imārat_) stands\r\nat the mouth of the well and there is an outer(?) mosque[1955] outside\r\n(_tāshqārī_) the enclosure in which the well is. The mosque is not well\r\ndone; it is in the Hindūstānī fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. Humāyūn's campaign._)\r\n\r\nAt the time Humāyūn got to horse, the rebel amīrs under Naṣīr Khān\r\n_Nuḥānī_ and Ma`rūf _Farmūlī_ were assembled at Jājmāū.[1956] Arrived\r\nwithin 20 to 30 miles of them, he sent out Mūmin Ātāka for news; it\r\nbecame a raid for loot; Mūmin Ātāka was not able to bring even the least\r\nuseful information. The rebels heard about him however, made no stay but\r\nfled and got away. After Mūmin Ātāka, Qusm-nāī(?) was sent for news,\r\nwith Bābā Chuhra[1957] and Būjka; they brought it of the breaking-up and\r\nflight of the rebels. Humāyūn advancing, took Jājmāū [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n301b.] and passed on. Near Dilmāū[1958] Fatḥ Khān _Sarwānī_ came and saw\r\nhim, and was sent to me with Mahdī Khwāja and Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. News of the Aūzbegs._)\r\n\r\nThis year 'Ubaidu'l-lāh Khān (_Aūzbeg_) led an army out of Bukhārā\r\nagainst Marv. In the citadel of Marv were perhaps 10 to 15 peasants whom\r\nhe overcame and killed; then having taken the revenues of Marv in 40 or\r\n50 days,[1959] he went on to Sarakhs. In Sarakhs were some 30 to 40\r\nRed-heads (_Qīzīl-bāsh_) who did not surrender, but shut the Gate; the\r\npeasantry however scattered them and opened the Gate to the Aūzbeg who\r\nentering, killed the Red-heads. Sarakhs taken, he went against T̤ūs and\r\nMashhad. The inhabitants of Mashhad being helpless, let him in. T̤ūs he\r\nbesieged for 8 months, took possession of on terms, did not keep those\r\nterms, but killed every man of name and made their women captive.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. Affairs of Gujrāt._)\r\n\r\nIn this year Bahādur Khān,—he who now rules in Gujrāt in the place of\r\nhis father Sl. Muz̤affar _Gujrātī_—having gone to Sl. Ibrāhīm after\r\nquarrel with his father, had been received without honour. He had sent\r\ndutiful letters to me while I was near Pānī-pat; I had replied by royal\r\nletters of favour and kindness summoning him to me. He had thought of\r\ncoming, but changing his mind, drew off from Ibrāhīm's army towards\r\nGujrāt. Meantime his father Sl. Muz̤affar had died (Friday Jumāda II.\r\n2nd AH.-March 16th 1526 AD.); his elder brother Sikandar Shāh who was\r\nSl. Muz̤affar's eldest son, had become ruler in their father's place\r\nand, owing to his evil disposition, [Sidenote: Fol. 302.] had been\r\nstrangled by his slave `Imādu'l-mulk, acting with others (Sha`ban\r\n14th—May 25th). Bahādur Khān, while he was on his road for Gujrāt, was\r\ninvited and escorted to sit in his father's place under the style\r\nBahādur Shāh (Ramẓān 26th—July 6th). He for his part did well; he\r\nretaliated by death on `Imādu'l-mulk for his treachery to his salt, and\r\nkilled some others of his father's begs.[1960] People point at him as a\r\ndreadnaught (_bī bāk_) youth and a shedder of much blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n933 AH.-OCT. 8TH 1526 TO SEP. 27TH 1527 AD.[1961]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Announcement of the birth of a son._)\r\n\r\nIn Muḥarram Beg Wais brought the news of Fārūq's birth; though a\r\nfoot-man had brought it already, he came this month for the gift to the\r\nmessenger of good tidings.[1962] The birth must have been on Friday eve,\r\nShawwāl 23rd (932 AH.-August 2nd 1526 AD.); the name given was Fārūq.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Casting of a mortar._)\r\n\r\n(_October 22nd-Muḥarram 15th_) Ustād `Alī-qulī had been ordered to cast\r\na large mortar for use against Bīāna and other forts which had not yet\r\nsubmitted. When all the furnaces and materials were ready, he sent a\r\nperson to me and, on Monday the 15th of the month, we went to see the\r\nmortar cast. Round the mortar-mould he had had eight furnaces made in\r\nwhich [Sidenote: Fol. 302b.] were the molten materials. From below each\r\nfurnace a channel went direct to the mould. When he opened the\r\nfurnace-holes on our arrival, the molten metal poured like water through\r\nall these channels into the mould. After awhile and before the mould was\r\nfull, the flow stopped from one furnace after another. Ustād `Alī-qulī\r\nmust have made some miscalculation either as to the furnaces or the\r\nmaterials. In his great distress, he was for throwing himself into the\r\nmould of molten metal, but we comforted him, put a robe of honour on\r\nhim, and so brought him out of his shame. The mould was left a day or\r\ntwo to cool; when it was opened, Ustād `Alī-qulī with great delight sent\r\nto say, \"The stone-chamber (_tāsh-awī_) is without defect; to cast the\r\npowder-compartment (_dārū-khāna_) is easy.\" He got the stone-chamber\r\nout and told off a body of men to accoutre[1963] it, while he busied\r\nhimself with casting the powder-compartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Varia._)\r\n\r\nMahdī Khwāja arrived bringing Fatḥ Khān _Sarwānī_ from Humāyūn's\r\npresence, they having parted from him in Dilmāū. I looked with favour on\r\nFatḥ Khān, gave him the _parganas_ that had been his father\r\n`Aẕam-humāyūn's, and other lands also, one _pargana_ given being worth a\r\n_krūr_ and 60 _laks_.[1964]\r\n\r\nIn Hindūstān they give permanent titles [_muqarrarī khiṯāblār_] to\r\nhighly-favoured amīrs, one such being `Aẕam-humāyūn (_August Might_),\r\none Khān-i-jahān (Khan-of-the-world), another [Sidenote: Fol. 303.]\r\nKhān-i-khānān (Khān-of-khāns). Fatḥ Khān's father's title was\r\n`Aẕam-humāyūn but I set this aside because on account of Humāyūn it was\r\nnot seemly for any person to bear it, and I gave Fatḥ Khān _Sarwānī_ the\r\ntitle of Khān-i-jahān.\r\n\r\n(_November 14th_) On Wednesday the 8th of Ṣafar[1965] awnings were set\r\nup (in the Chār-bāgh) at the edge of the large tank beyond the\r\ntamarind-trees, and an entertainment was prepared there. We invited Fatḥ\r\nKhān _Sarwānī_ to a wine-party, gave him wine, bestowed on him a turban\r\nand head-to-foot of my own wearing, uplifted his head with kindness and\r\nfavour[1966] and allowed him to go to his own districts. It was arranged\r\nfor his son Maḥmūd to remain always in waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Various military matters._)\r\n\r\n(_November 30th_) On Wednesday the 24th of Muḥarram[1967] Muḥammad `Alī\r\n(son of Mihtar) Ḥaidar the stirrup-holder was sent (to Humāyūn) with\r\nthis injunction, \"As—thanks be to God!—the rebels have fled, do you, as\r\nsoon as this messenger arrives, appoint a few suitable begs to Jūnpūr,\r\nand come quickly to us yourself, for Rānā Sangā the Pagan is\r\nconveniently close; let us think first of him!\"\r\n\r\nAfter (Humāyūn's) army had gone to the East, we appointed, to make a\r\nplundering excursion into the Bīāna neighbourhood, Tardī Beg (brother)\r\nof Qūj Beg with his elder brother Sher-afgan, Muḥammad Khalīl the\r\nmaster-gelder (_akhta-begī_) with his brethren and the gelders\r\n(_akhtachīlār_),[1968] Rustam _Turkmān_ with his brethren, and also, of\r\nthe Hindūstānī people, Daud _Sarwānī_. [Sidenote: Fol. 303b.] If they,\r\nby promise and persuasion, could make the Bīāna garrison look towards\r\nus, they were to do so; if not, they were to weaken the enemy by raid\r\nand plunder.\r\n\r\nIn the fort of Tahangar[1969] was `Ālam Khān the elder brother of that\r\nsame Niẕām Khān of Bīāna. People of his had come again and again to set\r\nforth his obedience and well-wishing; he now took it on himself to say,\r\n\"If the Pādshāh appoint an army, it will be my part by promise and\r\npersuasion to bring in the quiver-weavers of Bīāna and to effect the\r\ncapture of that fort.\" This being so, the following orders were given to\r\nthe braves of Tardī Beg's expedition, \"As `Ālam Khān, a local man, has\r\ntaken it on himself to serve and submit in this manner, act you with him\r\nand in the way he approves in this matter of Bīāna.\" Swordsmen though\r\nsome Hindūstānīs may be, most of them are ignorant and unskilled in\r\nmilitary move and stand (_yūrūsh u tūrūsh_), in soldierly counsel and\r\nprocedure. When our expedition joined `Ālam Khān, he paid no attention\r\nto what any-one else said, did not consider whether his action was good\r\nor bad, but went close up to Bīāna, taking our men with him. Our\r\nexpedition numbered from 250 to 300 Turks with somewhat over 2000\r\nHindūstānīs and local people, while Niẕām Khān of Bīāna's Afghāns and\r\n_sipāhīs[1970]_ were an army of over 4000 horse and of [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n304.] foot-men themselves again, more than 10,000. Niẕām Khān looked\r\nhis opponents over, sallied suddenly out and, his massed horse charging\r\ndown, put our expeditionary force to flight. His men unhorsed his elder\r\nbrother `Ālam Khān, took 5 or 6 others prisoner and contrived to capture\r\npart of the baggage. As we had already made encouraging promises to\r\nNiẕām Khān, we now, spite of this last impropriety, pardoned all earlier\r\nand this later fault, and sent him royal letters. As he heard of Rānā\r\nSangā's rapid advance, he had no resource but to call on Sayyid\r\nRafī`[1971] for mediation, surrender the fort to our men, and come in\r\nwith Sayyid Rafī`, when he was exalted to the felicity of an\r\ninterview.[1972] I bestowed on him a pargana in Mīān-dū-āb worth 20\r\n_laks_.[1973] Dost, Lord-of-the-gate was sent for a time to Bīāna, but a\r\nfew days later it was bestowed on Madhī Khwāja with a fixed allowance of\r\n70 _laks_,[1974] and he was given leave to go there.\r\n\r\nTātār Khān _Sārang-khānī_, who was in Gūālīār, had been sending\r\nconstantly to assure us of his obedience and good-wishes. After the\r\npagan took Kandār and was close to Bīāna, Dharmankat, one of the Gūālīār\r\nrājas, and another pagan styled Khān-i-jahān, went into the Gūālīār\r\nneighbourhood and, coveting the fort, began to stir trouble and tumult.\r\nTātār Khān, thus placed in difficulty, was for surrendering Gūālīār (to\r\nus). Most of our begs, household and best braves being away with\r\n(Humāyūn's) army or on various raids, we joined to Raḥīm-dād [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 304b.] a few Bhīra men and Lāhorīs with Hastachī[1975] _tūnqiṯār_\r\nand his brethren. We assigned _parganas_ in Gūālīār itself to all those\r\nmentioned above. Mullā Apāq and Shaikh Gurān (G'hurān) went also with\r\nthem, they to return after Raḥīm-dād was established in Gūālīār. By the\r\ntime they were near Gūālīār however, Tātār Khān's views had changed, and\r\nhe did not invite them into the fort. Meantime Shaikh Muḥammad _Ghaus̤_\r\n(Helper), a darwīsh-like man, not only very learned but with a large\r\nfollowing of students and disciples, sent from inside the fort to say to\r\nRaḥīm-dād, \"Get yourselves into the fort somehow, for the views of this\r\nperson (Tātār Khān) have changed, and he has evil in his mind.\" Hearing\r\nthis, Raḥīm-dād sent to say to Tātār Khān, \"There is danger from the\r\nPagan to those outside; let me bring a few men into the fort and let the\r\nrest stay outside.\" Under insistence, Tātār Khān agreed to this, and\r\nRaḥīm-dād went in with rather few men. Said he, \"Let our people stay\r\nnear this Gate,\" posted them near the Hātī-pul (Elephant-gate) and\r\nthrough that Gate during that same night brought in the whole of his\r\ntroop. Next day, Tātār Khān, reduced to helplessness, willy-nilly, made\r\nover the fort, and set out to come and wait on me in Āgra. A subsistence\r\nallowance of 20 _laks_ was assigned to him on Bīānwān _pargana_.[1976]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 305.] Muḥammad _Zaitūn_ also took the only course open\r\nto him by surrendering Dūlpūr and coming to wait on me. A _pargana_\r\nworth a few _laks_ was bestowed on him. Dūlpūr was made a royal domain\r\n(_khālṣa_) with Abū'l-fatḥ _Turkmān_[1977] as its military-collector\r\n(_shiqdār_).\r\n\r\nIn the Ḥiṣār-fīrūza neighbourhood Ḥamīd Khān _Sārang-khānī_ with a body\r\nof his own Afghāns and of the Panī Afghāns he had collected—from 3 to\r\n4,000 in all—was in a hostile and troublesome attitude. On Wednesday the\r\n15th Ṣafar (Nov. 21st) we appointed against him Chīn-tīmūr Sl.\r\n(_Chaghatāī_) with the commanders Secretary Aḥmadī, Abū'l-fatḥ\r\n_Turkmān_, Malik Dād _Kararānī_[1978] and Mujāhid Khān of Multān. These\r\ngoing, fell suddenly on him from a distance, beat his Afghāns well,\r\nkilled a mass of them and sent in many heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Embassy from Persia._)\r\n\r\nIn the last days of Ṣafar, Khwājagī Asad who had been sent to Shāh-zāda\r\nT̤ahmāsp[1979] in `Irāq, returned with a Turkmān named Sulaimān who\r\namongst other gifts brought two Circassian girls (_qīzlār_).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Attempt to poison Bābur._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 21st_) On Friday the 16th of the first Rabī` a strange event\r\noccurred which was detailed in a letter written to Kābul. That letter is\r\ninserted here just as it was written, without addition or taking-away,\r\nand is as follows:—[1980]\r\n\r\n\"The details of the momentous event of Friday the 16th of the first\r\nRabī` in the date 933 [Dec. 21st 1526 AD.] are as follows:—The\r\nill-omened old woman[1981] Ibrāhim's mother heard [Sidenote: Fol. 305b.]\r\nthat I ate things from the hands of Hindūstānīs—the thing being that\r\nthree or four months earlier, as I had not seen Hindūstānī dishes, I had\r\nordered Ibrāhīm's cooks to be brought and out of 50 or 60 had kept four.\r\nOf this she heard, sent to Atāwa (Etāwa) for Aḥmad the _chāshnīgīr_—in\r\nHindūstān they call a taster (_bakāwal_) a _chāshnīgīr_—and, having got\r\nhim,[1982] gave a _tūla_ of poison, wrapped in a square of paper,—as has\r\nbeen mentioned a _tūla_ is rather more than 2 _mis̤qāls_[1983]—into the\r\nhand of a slave-woman who was to give it to him. That poison Aḥmad gave\r\nto the Hindūstānī cooks in our kitchen, promising them four _parganas_\r\nif they would get it somehow into the food. Following the first\r\nslave-woman that ill-omened old woman sent a second to see if the first\r\ndid or did not give the poison she had received to Aḥmad. Well was it\r\nthat Aḥmad put the poison not into the cooking-pot but on a dish! He did\r\nnot put it into the pot because I had strictly ordered the tasters to\r\ncompel any Hindūstānīs who were present while food was cooking in the\r\npots, to taste that food.[1984] Our graceless tasters were neglectful\r\nwhen the food _(āsh_) was being dished up. Thin slices of bread were put\r\non a porcelain dish; on these less than half of the paper packet of\r\npoison was sprinkled, and over this buttered [Sidenote: Fol. 306.]\r\nfritters were laid. It would have been bad if the poison had been strewn\r\non the fritters or thrown into the pot. In his confusion, the man threw\r\nthe larger half into the fire-place.\"\r\n\r\n\"On Friday, late after the Afternoon Prayer, when the cooked meats were\r\nset out, I ate a good deal of a dish of hare and also much fried carrot,\r\ntook a few mouthfuls of the poisoned Hindūstānī food without noticing\r\nany unpleasant flavour, took also a mouthful or two of dried-meat\r\n(_qāq_). Then I felt sick. As some dried meat eaten on the previous day\r\nhad had an unpleasant taste, I thought my nausea due to the dried-meat.\r\nAgain and again my heart rose; after retching two or three times I was\r\nnear vomiting on the table-cloth. At last I saw it would not do, got up,\r\nwent retching every moment of the way to the water-closet (_āb-khāna_)\r\nand on reaching it vomited much. Never had I vomited after food, used\r\nnot to do so indeed while drinking. I became suspicious; I had the cooks\r\nput in ward and ordered some of the vomit given to a dog and the dog to\r\nbe watched. It was somewhat out-of-sorts near the first watch of the\r\nnext day; its belly was swollen and however much people threw stones at\r\nit and turned it over, it did not get up. In that state it remained till\r\nmid-day; it then got up; it did not die. [Sidenote: Fol. 306b.] One or\r\ntwo of the braves who also had eaten of that dish, vomited a good deal\r\nnext day; one was in a very bad state. In the end all escaped.\r\n(_Persian_) 'An evil arrived but happily passed on!' God gave me\r\nnew-birth! I am coming from that other world; I am born today of my\r\nmother; I was sick; I live; through God, I know today the worth of\r\nlife!\"[1985]\r\n\r\n\"I ordered Pay-master Sl. Muḥammad to watch the cook; when he was taken\r\nfor torture (_qīn_), he related the above particulars one after\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monday being Court-day, I ordered the grandees and notables, amīrs and\r\nwazīrs to be present and that those two men and two women should be\r\nbrought and questioned. They there related the particulars of the\r\naffair. That taster I had cut in pieces, that cook skinned alive; one of\r\nthose women I had thrown under an elephant, the other shot with a\r\nmatch-lock. The old woman (_būā_) I had kept under guard; she will meet\r\nher doom, the captive of her own act.\"[1986]\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday I drank a bowl of milk, on Sunday _`araq_ in which\r\nstamped-clay was dissolved.[1987] On Monday I drank milk in which were\r\ndissolved stamped-clay and the best theriac,[1988] a strong purge. As on\r\nthe first day, Saturday, something very dark like parched bile was\r\nvoided.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks be to God! no harm has been done. Till now I had not known so\r\nwell how sweet a thing life can seem! As the line has it, 'He who has\r\nbeen near to death knows the worth of life.' Spite of myself, I am all\r\nupset whenever the dreadful [Sidenote: Fol. 307.] occurrence comes back\r\nto my mind. It must have been God's favour gave me life anew; with what\r\nwords can I thank him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Although the terror of the occurrence was too great for words, I have\r\nwritten all that happened, with detail and circumstance, because I said\r\nto myself, 'Don't let their hearts be kept in anxiety!' Thanks be to\r\nGod! there may be other days yet to see! All has passed off well and for\r\ngood; have no fear or anxiety in your minds.\"\r\n\r\n\"This was written on Tuesday the 20th of the first Rabī`, I being then\r\nin the Chār-bāgh.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we were free from the anxiety of these occurrences, the above\r\nletter was written and sent to Kābul.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Dealings with Ibrāhīm's family._)\r\n\r\nAs this great crime had raised its head through that ill-omened old\r\nwoman (_būā-i-bad-bakht_), she was given over to Yūnas-i-`alī and\r\nKhwājagī Asad who after taking her money and goods, slaves and\r\nslave-women (_dādūk_), made her over for careful watch to `Abdu'r-raḥīm\r\n_shaghāwal_.[1989] Her grandson, Ibrāhīm's son had been cared for with\r\nmuch respect and delicacy, but as the attempt on my life had been made,\r\nclearly, by that family, it did not seem advisable to keep him in Agra;\r\nhe was joined therefore to Mullā Sarsān—who had come from Kāmrān on\r\nimportant business—and was started off with the Mullā to Kāmrān on\r\nThursday Rabī` I. 29th (Jan. 3rd 1527 AD.).[1990]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Humāyūn's campaign._)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 307b.] Humāyūn, acting against the Eastern rebels[1991]\r\ntook Jūna-pūr (_sic_), went swiftly against Naṣīr Khān (_Nūḥānī_) in\r\nGhāzī-pūr and found that he had gone across the Gang-river, presumably\r\non news* of Humāyūn's approach. From Ghāzī-pūr Humāyūn went against\r\nKharīd[1992] but the Afghāns of the place had crossed the Sārū-water\r\n(Gogra) presumably on the news* of his coming. Kharīd was plundered and\r\nthe army turned back.\r\n\r\nHumāyūn, in accordance with my arrangements, left Shāh Mīr Ḥusain and\r\nSl. Junaid with a body of effective braves in Jūna-pūr, posted Qāẓī Jīā\r\nwith them, and placed Shaikh Bāyazīd [_Farmūlī_] in Aude (Oude). These\r\nimportant matters settled, he crossed Gang from near Karrah-Mānikpūr and\r\ntook the Kālpī road. When he came opposite Kālpī, in which was Jalāl\r\nKhān _Jik-hat's_ (son) `Ālam Khān who had sent me dutiful letters but\r\nhad not waited on me himself, he sent some-one to chase fear from `Ālam\r\nKhān's heart and so brought him along (to Āgra).\r\n\r\nHumāyūn arrived and waited on me in the Garden of Eight-paradises[1993]\r\non Sunday the 3rd of the 2nd Rabī` (Jan. 6th 1527 AD.). On the same day\r\nKhwāja Dost-i-khāwand arrived from Kābul.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Rānā Sangā's approach._)[1994]\r\n\r\nMeantime Mahdī Khwāja's people began to come in, treading on one\r\nanother's heels and saying, \"The Rānā's advance is certain. Ḥasan Khān\r\n_Mīwātī_ is heard of also as likely to join him. They must be thought\r\nabout above all else. It would favour our fortune, if a troop came ahead\r\nof the army to reinforce Bīāna.\" [Sidenote: Fol. 308.]\r\n\r\nDeciding to get to horse, we sent on, to ride light to Bīāna, the\r\ncommanders Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā, Yūnas-i-`alī, Shāh Manṣūr _Barlās_, Kitta\r\nBeg, Qismatī[1995] and Būjka.\r\n\r\nIn the fight with Ibrāhīm, Ḥasan Khān _Mīwātī's_ son Nāhar Khān had\r\nfallen into our hands; we had kept him as an hostage and, ostensibly on\r\nhis account, his father had been making comings-and-goings with us,\r\nconstantly asking for him. It now occurred to several people that if\r\nḤasan Khān were conciliated by sending him his son, he would thereby be\r\nthe more favourably disposed and his waiting on me might be the better\r\nbrought about. Accordingly Nāhar Khān was dressed in a robe of honour;\r\npromises were made to him for his father, and he was given leave to go.\r\nThat hypocritical mannikin [Ḥasan Khān] must have waited just till his\r\nson had leave from me to go, for on hearing of this and while his son as\r\nyet had not joined him, he came out of Alūr (Alwar) and at once joined\r\nRānā Sangā in Toda(bhīm, Āgra District). It must have been ill-judged to\r\nlet his son go just then.\r\n\r\nMeantime much rain was falling; parties were frequent; even Humāyūn was\r\npresent at them and, abhorrent though it was to him, sinned[1996] every\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Tramontane affairs._)\r\n\r\nOne of the strange events in these days of respite[1997] was this:—When\r\nHumāyūn was coming from Fort Victory. (Qila`-i-ẕafar) to join the\r\nHindūstān army, (Muḥ. 932 AH.-Oct. 1525 AD.) [Sidenote: Fol. 308b.]\r\nMullā Bābā of Pashāghar (_Chaghatāī_) and his younger brother Bābā\r\nShaikh deserted on the way, and went to Kītīn-qarā Sl. (_Aūzbeg_), into\r\nwhose hands Balkh had fallen through the enfeeblement of its\r\ngarrison.[1998] This hollow mannikin and his younger brother having\r\ntaken the labours of this side (Cis-Balkh?) on their own necks, come\r\ninto the neighbourhood of Aībak, Khurram and Sār-bāgh.[1999]\r\n\r\nShāh Sikandar—his footing in Ghūrī lost through the surrender of\r\nBalkh—is about to make over that fort to the Aūzbeg, when Mullā Bābā and\r\nBābā Shaikh, coming with a few Aūzbegs, take possession of it. Mīr\r\nHamah, as his fort is close by, has no help for it; he is for submitting\r\nto the Aūzbeg, but a few days later Mullā Bābā and Bābā Shaikh come with\r\na few Aūzbegs to Mīr Hamah's fort, purposing to make the Mīr and his\r\ntroop march out and to take them towards Balkh. Mīr Hamah makes Bābā\r\nShaikh dismount inside the fort, and gives the rest felt huts (_aūtāq_)\r\nhere and there. He slashes at Bābā Shaikh, puts him and some others in\r\nbonds, and sends a man galloping off to Tīngrī-bīrdī (_Qūchīn_, in\r\nQūndūz). Tīngrī-bīrdī sends off Yār-i-`alī and `Abdu'l-laṯīf with a few\r\neffective braves, but before they reach Mīr Hamah's fort, Mullā Bābā has\r\narrived there with his Aūzbegs; he had thought of a hand-to-hand fight\r\n(_aūrūsh-mūrūsh_), but he can do nothing. Mīr Hamah and his men joined\r\nTīngrī-bīrdī's and came to Qūndūz. Bābā Shaikh's wound must have been\r\nsevere; they cut his head off and Mīr Hamah brought [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n309.] it (to Āgra) in these same days of respite. I uplifted his head\r\nwith favour and kindness, distinguishing him amongst his fellows and\r\nequals. When Bāqī _shaghāwal_ went [to Balkh][2000] I promised him a\r\n_ser_ of gold for the head of each of the ill-conditioned old couple;\r\none _ser_ of gold was now given to Mīr Hamah for Bābā Shaikh's head,\r\nover and above the favours referred to above.[2001]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Action of part of the Bīāna reinforcement._)\r\n\r\nQismatī who had ridden light for Bīāna, brought back several heads he\r\nhad cut off; when he and Būjka had gone with a few braves to get news,\r\nthey had beaten two of the Pagan's scouting-parties and had made 70 to\r\n80 prisoners. Qismatī brought news that Ḥasan Khān _Mīwātī_ really had\r\njoined Rānā Sangā.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Trial-test of the large mortar of f. 302._)\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 10th_) On Sunday the 8th of the month (Jumāda I.), I went to see\r\nUstād `Alī-qulī discharge stones from that large mortar of his in\r\ncasting which the stone-chamber was without defect and which he had\r\ncompleted afterwards by casting the powder-compartment. It was\r\ndischarged at the Afternoon Prayer; the throw of the stone was 1600\r\npaces. A gift was made to the Master of a sword-belt, robe of honour,\r\nand _tīpūchāq_ (horse).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Bābur leaves Āgra against Rānā Sangā._)\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 11th_) On Monday the 9th of the first Jumāda, we got out of the\r\nsuburbs of Āgra, on our journey (_safar_) for the Holy War, and\r\ndismounted in the open country, where we remained three or four days to\r\ncollect our army and be its rallying-point.[2002] As little confidence\r\nwas placed in Hindūstānī people, the Hindūstān amīrs were inscribed for\r\nexpeditions to this or to that side:—`Ālam Khān (_Tahangarī_) was sent\r\nhastily to Gūālīār to [Sidenote: Fol. 309b.] reinforce Raḥīm-dād; Makan,\r\nQāsim Beg _Sanbalī_ (_Saṃbhalī_), Ḥamīd with his elder and younger\r\nbrethren and Muḥammad _Zaitūn_ were inscribed to go swiftly to Sanbal.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. Defeat of the advance-force._)\r\n\r\nInto this same camp came the news that owing to Rānā Sangā's swift\r\nadvance with all his army,[2003] our scouts were able neither to get\r\ninto the fort (Bīāna) themselves nor to send news into it. The Bīāna\r\ngarrison made a rather incautious sally too far out; the enemy fell on\r\nthem in some force and put them to rout.[2004] There Sangur Khān\r\n_Janjūha_ became a martyr. Kitta Beg had galloped into the pell-mell\r\nwithout his cuirass; he got one pagan afoot (_yāyāglātīb_) and was\r\novercoming him, when the pagan snatched a sword from one of Kitta Beg's\r\nown servants and slashed the Beg across the shoulder. Kitta Beg suffered\r\ngreat pain; he could not come into the Holy-battle with Rānā Sangā, was\r\nlong in recovering and always remained blemished.\r\n\r\nWhether because they were themselves afraid, or whether to frighten\r\nothers is not known but Qismatī, Shāh Manṣūr _Barlās_ and all from Bīāna\r\npraised and lauded the fierceness and valour of the pagan army.\r\n\r\nQāsim Master-of-the-horse was sent from the starting-ground (_safar\r\nqīlghān yūrt_) with his spadesmen, to dig many wells where the army was\r\nnext to dismount in the Madhākūr _pargana_.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 16th_) Marching out of Āgra on Saturday the 14th of the first\r\nJumāda, dismount was made where the wells had been [Sidenote: Fol. 310.]\r\ndug. We marched on next day. It crossed my mind that the well-watered\r\nground for a large camp was at Sīkrī.[2005] It being possible that the\r\nPagan was encamped there and in possession of the water, we arrayed\r\nprecisely, in right, left and centre. As Qismatī and Darwīsh-i-muḥammad\r\n_Sārbān_ in their comings and goings had seen and got to know all sides\r\nof Bīāna, they were sent ahead to look for camping-ground on the bank of\r\nthe Sīkrī-lake (_kūl_). When we reached the (Madhākūr) camp, persons\r\nwere sent galloping off to tell Mahdī Khwāja and the Bīāna garrison to\r\njoin me without delay. Humāyūn's servant Beg Mīrak _Mughūl_ was sent out\r\nwith a few braves to get news of the Pagan. They started that night, and\r\nnext morning brought word that he was heard of as having arrived and\r\ndismounted at a place one _kuroh_ (2 miles) on our side (_aīlkārāk_) of\r\nBasāwar.[2006] On this same day Mahdī Khwāja and Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā\r\nrejoined us with the troops that had ridden light to Bīāna.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. Discomfiture of a reconnoitring party._)\r\n\r\nThe begs were appointed in turns for scouting-duty. When it was\r\n`Abdu'l-`azīz's turn, he went out of Sīkrī, looking neither before nor\r\nbehind, right out along the road to Kanwā which is 5 _kuroh_ (10 m.)\r\naway. The Rānā must have been marching forward; he heard of our men's\r\nmoving out in their reinless (_jalāū-sīz_) way, and made 4 or 5,000 of\r\nhis own fall suddenly on them. With `Abdu'l-`azīz and Mullā Apāq may\r\nhave been 1000 to 1500 men; they took no stock of their opponents but\r\njust [Sidenote: Fol. 310b.] got to grips; they were hurried off at once,\r\nmany of them being made prisoner.\r\n\r\nOn news of this, we despatched Khalīfa's Muḥibb-i-`alī with Khalīfa's\r\nretainers. Mullā Ḥusain and some others _aūbrūqsūbrūq_[2007]* were sent\r\nto support them,[2008] and Muḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang_ also. Presumably it\r\nwas before the arrival of this first, Muḥibb-i-`alī's, reinforcement\r\nthat the Pagan had hurried off `Abdu'l-`azīz and his men, taken his\r\nstandard, martyred Mullā Ni`mat, Mullā Dāūd and the younger brother\r\nof Mullā Apāq, with several more. Directly the reinforcement\r\narrived the pagans overcame T̤āhir-tibrī, the maternal uncle of\r\nKhalīfa's Muḥibb-i-`alī, who had not got up with the hurrying\r\nreinforcement[?].[2009] Meantime Muḥibb-i-`alī even had been thrown\r\ndown, but Bāltū getting in from the rear, brought him out. The enemy\r\npursued for over a _kuroh_ (2 m.), stopped however at the sight of the\r\nblack mass of Muḥ. `Alī _Jang-jang's_ troops.\r\n\r\nFoot upon foot news came that the foe had come near and nearer. We put\r\non our armour and our horses' mail, took our arms and, ordering the\r\ncarts to be dragged after us, rode out at the gallop. We advanced one\r\n_kuroh_. The foe must have turned aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. Bābur fortifies his camp._)\r\n\r\nFor the sake of water, we dismounted with a large lake (_kūl_) on one\r\nside of us. Our front was defended by carts chained together*, the space\r\nbetween each two, across which the chains stretched, being 7 or 8 _qārī_\r\n(_circa_ yards). Musṯafa _Rūmī_ had [Sidenote: Fol. 311.] had the carts\r\nmade in the Rūmī way, excellent carts, very strong and suitable.[2010]\r\nAs Ustād `Alī-qulī was jealous of him, Musṯafa was posted to the right,\r\nin front of Humāyūn. Where the carts did not reach to, Khurāsānī and\r\nHindūstānī spadesmen and miners were made to dig a ditch.\r\n\r\nOwing to the Pagan's rapid advance, to the fighting-work in Bīāna and to\r\nthe praise and laud of the pagans made by Shāh Manṣūr, Qismatī and the\r\nrest from Bīāna, people in the army shewed sign of want of heart. On the\r\ntop of all this came the defeat of `Abdu'l-`azīz. In order to hearten\r\nour men, and give a look of strength to the army, the camp was defended\r\nand shut in where there were no carts, by stretching ropes of raw hide\r\non wooden tripods, set 7 or 8 _qārī_ apart. Time had drawn out to 20 or\r\n25 days before these appliances and materials were fully ready.[2011]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_q. A reinforcement from Kābul._)\r\n\r\nJust at this time there arrived from Kābul Qāsim-i-ḥusain Sl. (_Aūzbeg\r\nShaibān_) who is the son of a daughter of Sl. Ḥusain M. (_Bāī-qarā_),\r\nand with him Aḥmad-i-yūsuf (_Aūghlāqchī_), Qawwām-i-aūrdū Shāh and also\r\nseveral single friends of mine, counting up in all to 500 men. Muḥammad\r\nSharīf, the astrologer of ill-augury, came with them too, so did Bābā\r\nDost the water-bearer (_sūchī_) who, having gone to Kābul for wine, had\r\nthere [Sidenote: Fol. 311b.] loaded three strings of camels with\r\nacceptable Ghaznī wines.\r\n\r\nAt a time such as this, when, as has been mentioned, the army was\r\nanxious and afraid by reason of past occurrences and vicissitudes, wild\r\nwords and opinions, this Muḥammad Sharīf, the ill-augurer, though he had\r\nnot a helpful word to say to me, kept insisting to all he met, \"Mars is\r\nin the west in these days;[2012] who comes into the fight from this\r\n(east) side will be defeated.\" Timid people who questioned the\r\nill-augurer, became the more shattered in heart. We gave no ear to his\r\nwild words, made no change in our operations, but got ready in earnest\r\nfor the fight.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 24th_) On Sunday the 22nd (of Jumāda 1.) Shaikh Jamāl was sent to\r\ncollect all available quiver-wearers from between the two waters (Ganges\r\nand Jumna) and from Dihlī, so that with this force he might over-run and\r\nplunder the Mīwāt villages, leaving nothing undone which could awaken\r\nthe enemy's anxiety for that side. Mullā Tark-i-`alī, then on his way\r\nfrom Kābul, was ordered to join Shaikh Jamāl and to neglect nothing of\r\nruin and plunder in Mīwāt; orders to the same purport were given also to\r\nMaghfūr the Dīwān. They went; they over-ran and raided a few villages in\r\nlonely corners (_būjqāq_); they took some prisoners; but their passage\r\nthrough did not arouse much anxiety!\r\n\r\n\r\n(_r. Bābur renounces wine._)\r\n\r\nOn Monday the 23rd of the first Jumāda (Feb. 25th), when [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n312.] I went out riding, I reflected, as I rode, that the wish to cease\r\nfrom sin had been always in my mind, and that my forbidden acts had set\r\nlasting stain upon my heart. Said I, \"Oh! my soul!\"\r\n\r\n   (_Persian_) \"How long wilt thou draw savour from sin?\r\n                Repentance is not without savour, taste it!\"[2013]\r\n\r\n   (_Turkī_)    Through years how many has sin defiled thee?\r\n                How much of peace has transgression given thee?\r\n                How much hast thou been thy passions' slave?\r\n                How much of thy life flung away?\r\n\r\n                With the Ghāzī's resolve since now thou hast marched,\r\n                Thou hast looked thine own death in the face!\r\n                Who resolves to hold stubbornly fast to the death,\r\n                Thou knowest what change he attains,\r\n\r\n                That far he removes him from all things forbidden,\r\n                That from all his offences he cleanses himself.\r\n                With my own gain before me, I vowed to obey,\r\n                In this my transgression,[2014] the drinking\r\n                  of wine.[2015]\r\n\r\n                The flagons and cups of silver and gold, the vessels\r\n                  of feasting,\r\n                I had them all brought;\r\n                I had them all broken up[2016] then and there.\r\n                Thus eased I my heart by renouncement of wine.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of the gold and silver vessels were shared out to\r\ndeserving persons and to darwīshes. The first to agree in renouncing\r\nwine was `Asas;[2017] he had already agreed also about leaving his beard\r\nuntrimmed.[2018] That night and next day some [Sidenote: Fol. 312b.] 300\r\nbegs and persons of the household, soldiers and not soldiers, renounced\r\nwine. What wine we had with us was poured on the ground; what Bābā Dost\r\nhad brought was ordered salted to make vinegar. At the place where the\r\nwine was poured upon the ground, a well was ordered to be dug, built up\r\nwith stone and having an almshouse beside it. It was already finished in\r\nMuḥarram 935 (AH.-Sep. 1528 AD.) at the time I went to Sīkrī from Dūlpūr\r\non my way back from visiting Gūālīār.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_s. Remission of a due._)\r\n\r\nI had vowed already that, if I gained the victory over Sangā the pagan,\r\nI would remit the _tamghā_[2019] to all Musalmāns. Of this vow\r\nDarwīsh-i-muḥammad _Sārbān_ and Shaikh Zain reminded me at the time I\r\nrenounced wine. Said I, \"You do well to remind me.\"\r\n\r\n*_The tamghā_ was remitted to all Musalmāns of the dominions I\r\nheld.[2020] I sent for the clerks (_munshīlār_), and ordered them to\r\nwrite for their news-letters (_akhbar_) the _farmān_ concerning the two\r\nimportant acts that had been done. Shaikh Zain wrote the _farmān_ with\r\nhis own elegance (_inshāsī bīla_) and his fine letter (_inshā_) was sent\r\nto all my dominions. It is as follows:—[2021]\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMĀN ANNOUNCING BĀBUR'S RENUNCIATION OF WINE.[2022]\r\n\r\n[2023] _Let us praise the Long-suffering One who loveth the penitent and\r\nwho loveth the cleansers of themselves; and let thanks be rendered to\r\nthe Gracious One who absolveth His debtors, and forgiveth those who seek\r\nforgiveness. Blessings be upon Muḥammad the Crown of Creatures, on the\r\nHoly family, on the pure Companions_, and on the mirrors of the glorious\r\ncongregation, to wit, the Masters of Wisdom who are treasure-houses of\r\nthe pearls of purity and who bear the impress of the sparkling jewels of\r\nthis purport:—that the nature of man is prone to evil, and that the\r\nabandonment of sinful appetites is only feasible by Divine aid\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 313.] and the help that cometh from on high. \"_Every\r\nsoul is prone unto evil_,\"[2024] (and again) \"_This is the bounty of\r\nGod_; _He will give the same unto whom He pleaseth_; _and God is endued\r\nwith great bounty_.\"[2025]\r\n\r\nOur motive for these remarks and for repeating these statements is that,\r\nby reason of human frailty, of the customs of kings and of the great,\r\nall of us, from the Shāh to the sipāhī, in the heyday of our youth, have\r\ntransgressed and done what we ought not to have done. After some days of\r\nsorrow and repentance, we abandoned evil practices one by one, and the\r\ngates of retrogression became closed. But the renunciation of wine, the\r\ngreatest and most indispensable of renunciations, remained under a veil\r\nin the chamber of deeds _pledged to appear in due season_, and did not\r\nshow its countenance until the glorious hour when we had put on the garb\r\nof the holy warrior and had encamped with the army of Islām over against\r\nthe infidels in order to slay them. On this occasion I received a secret\r\ninspiration and heard an infallible voice say \"_Is not the time yet come\r\nunto those who believe, that their hearts should humbly submit to the\r\nadmonition of God, and that truth which hath been revealed?_\"[2026]\r\nThereupon we set ourselves to extirpate the things of wickedness, and we\r\nearnestly knocked at the gates of repentance. The Guide of Help assisted\r\nus, according to the saying \"_Whoever knocks and re-knocks, to him it\r\nwill be opened_\", and an order was given that with the Holy War there\r\nshould [Sidenote: Fol. 313b.] begin the still greater war which has to\r\nbe waged against sensuality. In short, we declared with sincerity that\r\n_we would subjugate our passions_, and I engraved on the tablet of my\r\nheart \"_I turn unto Thee with repentance, and I am the first of true\r\nbelievers_\".[2027] And I made public the resolution to abstain from\r\nwine, which had been hidden in the treasury of my breast. The victorious\r\nservants, in accordance with the illustrious order, dashed upon the\r\nearth of contempt and destruction the flagons and the cups, and the\r\nother utensils in gold and silver, which in their number and their\r\nbrilliance were like the stars of the firmament. They dashed them in\r\npieces, as, God willing! soon will be dashed the gods of the\r\nidolaters,—and they distributed the fragments among the poor and needy.\r\nBy the blessing of this acceptable repentance, many of the courtiers, by\r\nvirtue of the saying that _men follow the religion of their kings_,\r\nembraced abstinence at the same assemblage, and entirely renounced the\r\nuse of wine, and up till now crowds of our subjects hourly attain this\r\nauspicious happiness. I hope that in accordance with the saying \"_He who\r\nincites to good deeds has the same reward as he who does them_\" the\r\nbenefit of this action will react on the royal fortune and increase it\r\nday by day by victories.\r\n\r\nAfter carrying out this design an universal decree was issued that in\r\nthe imperial dominions—May God protect them from [Sidenote: Fol. 314.]\r\nevery danger and calamity—no-one shall partake of strong drink, or\r\nengage in its manufacture, nor sell it, nor buy it or possess it, nor\r\nconvey it or fetch it. \"_Beware of touching it._\" \"_Perchance this will\r\ngive you prosperity._\"[2028]\r\n\r\nIn thanks for these great victories,[2029] and as a thank-offering for\r\nGod's acceptance of repentance and sorrow, the ocean of the royal\r\nmunificence became commoved, and those waves of kindness, which are the\r\ncause of the civilization of the world and of the glory of the sons of\r\nAdam, were displayed,—and throughout all the territories the tax\r\n(_tamghā_) on Musalmāns was abolished,—though its yield was more than\r\nthe dreams of avarice, and though it had been established and maintained\r\nby former rulers,—for it is a practice outside of the edicts of the\r\nPrince of Apostles (Muḥammad). So a decree was passed that in no city,\r\ntown, road, ferry, pass, or port, should the tax be levied or exacted.\r\nNo alteration whatsoever of this order is to be permitted. \"_Whoever\r\nafter hearing it makes any change therein, the sin of such change will\r\nbe upon him._\"[2030]\r\n\r\nThe proper course (_sabīl_) for all who shelter under the shade of the\r\nroyal benevolence, whether they be Turk, Tājik, `Arab, Hindī, or Fārsī\r\n(Persian), peasants or soldiers, of every nation or tribe of the sons\r\nof Adam, is to strengthen themselves by the tenets of religion, and to\r\nbe full of hope and prayer for the dynasty which is linked with\r\neternity, and to adhere to these ordinances, and not in any way to\r\ntransgress them. It behoves all to act according to this _farmān_; they\r\nare to accept it as authentic when it comes attested by the Sign-Manual.\r\n\r\nWritten by order of the Exalted one,—May his excellence endure for ever!\r\non the 24th of Jumāda I. 933 (February 26th 1527).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_t. Alarm in Bābur's camp._)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 314b.] In these days, as has been mentioned, (our\r\npeople) great and small, had been made very anxious and timid by past\r\noccurrences. No manly word or brave counsel was heard from any one\r\nsoever. What bold speech was there from the wazīrs who are to speak out\r\n(_dīgūchī_), or from the amīrs who will devour the land\r\n(_wilāyat-yīghūchī_)?[2031] None had advice to give, none a bold plan of\r\nhis own to expound. Khalīfa (however) did well in this campaign,\r\nneglecting nothing of control and supervision, painstaking and\r\ndiligence.\r\n\r\nAt length after I had made enquiry concerning people's want of heart and\r\nhad seen their slackness for myself, a plan occurred to me; I summoned\r\nall the begs and braves and said to them, \"Begs and braves!\r\n\r\n   (_Persian_) Who comes into the world will die;\r\n               What lasts and lives will be God.\r\n\r\n   (_Turkī_)   He who hath entered the assembly of life,\r\n               Drinketh at last of the cup of death.\r\n\r\n               He who hath come to the inn of life,\r\n               Passeth at last from Earth's house of woe.\r\n\r\n\"Better than life with a bad name, is death with a good one.\r\n\r\n   (_Persian_) Well is it with me, if I die with good name!\r\n               A good name must I have, since the body is death's.[2032]\r\n\r\n\"God the Most High has allotted to us such happiness and has created for\r\nus such good-fortune that we die as martyrs, we kill as avengers of His\r\ncause. Therefore must each of you take oath [Sidenote: Fol. 315.] upon\r\nHis Holy Word that he will not think of turning his face from this foe,\r\nor withdraw from this deadly encounter so long as life is not rent from\r\nhis body.\" All those present, beg and retainer, great and small, took\r\nthe Holy Book joyfully into their hands and made vow and compact to this\r\npurport. The plan was perfect; it worked admirably for those near and\r\nafar, for seërs and hearers, for friend and foe.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_u. Bābur's perilous position._)\r\n\r\nIn those same days trouble and disturbance arose on every side:—Ḥusain\r\nKhān _Nuḥānī_ went and took Rāprī; Quṯb Khān's man took Chandwār[2033];\r\na mannikin called Rustam Khān who had collected quiver-wearers from\r\nBetween-the-two-waters (Ganges and Jamna), took Kūl (Koel) and made\r\nKīchīk 'Alī prisoner; Khwāja Zāhid abandoned Saṃbal and went off; Sl.\r\nMuḥammad _Dūldāī_ came from Qanūj to me; the Gūālīār pagans laid siege\r\nto that fort; 'Ālam Khān when sent to reinforce it, did not go to\r\nGūālīār but to his own district. Every day bad news came from every\r\nside. Desertion of many Hindūstānīs set in; Haibat Khān\r\n_Karg-andāz_[2034] deserted and went to Saṃbal; Ḥasan Khān of Bārī\r\ndeserted and joined the Pagan. We gave attention to none of them but\r\nwent straight on with our own affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_v. Bābur advances to fight._)\r\n\r\nThe apparatus and appliances, the carts and wheeled tripods being ready,\r\nwe arrayed in right, left and centre, and marched forward on New Year's\r\nDay,[2035] Tuesday, the 9th of the second [Sidenote: Fol. 315b.] Jumāda\r\n(March 13th), having the carts[2036] and wheeled tripods moving in\r\nfront of us, with Ustād `Alī-qulī and all the matchlock-men ranged\r\nbehind them in order that these men, being on foot, should not be left\r\nbehind the array but should advance with it.\r\n\r\nWhen the various divisions, right, left and centre, had gone each to its\r\nplace, I galloped from one to another to give encouragement to begs,\r\nbraves, and _sipāhīs_. After each man had had assigned to him his post\r\nand usual work with his company, we advanced, marshalled on the plan\r\ndetermined, for as much as one _kuroh_ (2 m.)[2037] and then dismounted.\r\n\r\nThe Pagan's men, for their part, were on the alert; they came from their\r\nside, one company after another.\r\n\r\nThe camp was laid out and strongly protected by ditch and carts. As we\r\ndid not intend to fight that day, we sent a few unmailed braves ahead,\r\nwho were to get to grips with the enemy and thus take an omen. They made\r\na few pagans prisoner, cut off and brought in their heads. Malik Qāsim\r\nalso cut off and brought in a few heads; he did well. By these successes\r\nthe hearts of our men became very strong.\r\n\r\nWhen we marched on next day, I had it in my mind to fight, but Khalīfa\r\nand other well-wishers represented that the camping-ground previously\r\ndecided on was near and that it would favour our fortunes if we had a\r\nditch and defences made there and went there direct. Khalīfa accordingly\r\nrode off to get [Sidenote: Fol. 316.] the ditch dug; he settled its\r\nposition with the spades-men, appointed overseers of the work and\r\nreturned to us. (_w. The battle of Kānwa._)[2038]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the 13th of the second Jumāda (March 17th, 1527 AD.) we had\r\nthe carts dragged in front of us (as before), made a _kuroh_ (2 m.) of\r\nroad, arrayed in right, left and centre, and dismounted on the ground\r\nselected.\r\n\r\nA few tents had been set up; a few were in setting up when news of the\r\nappearance of the enemy was brought. Mounting instantly, I ordered every\r\nman to his post and that our array should be protected with the\r\ncarts.[2039]\r\n\r\n*As the following Letter-of-victory (_Fatḥ-nāma_) which is what Shaikh\r\nZain had indited, makes known particulars about the army of Islām, the\r\ngreat host of the pagans with the position of their arrayed ranks, and\r\nthe encounters had between them and the army of Islām, it is inserted\r\nhere without addition or deduction.[2040]\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAIKH ZAIN'S LETTER-OF-VICTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Introduction._)\r\n\r\n_Praise be to God the Faithful Promiser, the Helper of His servants, the\r\nSupporter of His armies, the Scatterer of hostile hosts, the One alone\r\nwithout whom there is nothing._ [Sidenote: Fol. 316b.]\r\n\r\n_O Thou the Exalter of the pillars of Islām, Helper of thy faithful\r\nminister, Overthrower of the pedestals of idols, Overcomer of rebellious\r\nfoes, Exterminator to the uttermost of the followers of darkness!_\r\n\r\n_Lauds be to God the Lord of the worlds, and may the blessing of God be\r\nupon the best of His creatures Muḥammad, Lord of ghāzīs and champions of\r\nthe Faith, and upon his companions, the pointers of the way, until the\r\nDay of judgment._\r\n\r\nThe successive gifts of the Almighty are the cause of frequent praises\r\nand thanksgivings, and the number of these praises and thanksgivings is,\r\nin its turn, the cause of the constant succession of God's mercies. For\r\nevery mercy a thanksgiving is due, and every thanksgiving is followed by\r\na mercy. To render full thanks is beyond men's power; the mightiest are\r\nhelpless to discharge their obligations. Above all, adequate thanks\r\ncannot be rendered for a benefit than which none is greater in the world\r\nand nothing is more blessed, in the world to come, to wit, victory over\r\nmost powerful infidels and dominion over wealthiest heretics, \"_these\r\nare the unbelievers_, _the wicked_.\"[2041] In the eyes of the judicious,\r\nno blessing can be greater than this. Thanks be to God! that this great\r\nblessing and mighty boon, which from the cradle until now has been the\r\nreal object of this right-thinking mind (Bābur's), has now manifested\r\nitself by the graciousness of the King of the worlds; the Opener who\r\ndispenses his treasures without awaiting solicitation, hath opened them\r\nwith a master-key before our victorious Nawāb (Bābur),[2042] so that the\r\nnames of our[2043] conquering heroes have been emblazoned in the records\r\nof glorious _ghāzīs_. By the help of our victorious soldiers the\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 317.] standards of Islām have been raised to the highest\r\npinnacles. The account of this auspicious fortune is as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Rānā Sangā and his forces._)\r\n\r\nWhen the flashing-swords of our Islām-guarded soldiers had illuminated\r\nthe land of Hindūstān with rays of victory and conquest, as has been\r\nrecorded in former letters-of-victory,[2044] the Divine favour caused\r\nour standards to be upreared in the territories of Dihlī, Āgra, Jūn-pūr,\r\nKharīd,[2045] Bihār, _etc._, when many chiefs, both pagans and\r\nMuḥammadans submitted to our generals and shewed sincere obedience to\r\nour fortunate Nawāb. But Rānā Sangā the pagan who in earlier times\r\nbreathed submissive to the Nawāb,[2046] now _was puffed up with pride\r\nand became of the number of unbelievers_.[2047] Satan-like he threw back\r\nhis head and collected an army of accursed heretics, thus gathering a\r\nrabble-rout of whom some wore the accursed torque (_ṯauq_), the\r\n_zīnār_,[2048] on the neck, some had in the skirt the calamitous thorn\r\nof apostacy.[2049] Previous to the rising in Hindūstān of the Sun of\r\ndominion and the emergence there of the light of the Shāhanshāh's\r\nKhalīfate [_i.e._ Bābur's] the authority of that execrated pagan\r\n(Sangā)—_at the Judgment Day he shall have no friend_,[2050] was such\r\nthat not one of all the exalted sovereigns of this wide realm, such as\r\nthe Sulṯān of Dihlī, the [Sidenote: Fol. 317b.] Sulṯān of Gujrāt and the\r\nSulṯān of Mandū, could cope with this evil-dispositioned one, without\r\nthe help of other pagans; one and all they cajoled him and temporized\r\nwith him; and he had this authority although the rājas and rāīs of high\r\ndegree, who obeyed him in this battle, and the governors and commanders\r\nwho were amongst his followers in this conflict, had not obeyed him in\r\nany earlier fight or, out of regard to their own dignity, been friendly\r\nwith him. Infidel standards dominated some 200 towns in the territories\r\nof Islām; in them mosques and shrines fell into ruin; from them the\r\nwives and children of the Faithful were carried away captive. So greatly\r\nhad his forces grown that, according to the Hindū calculation by which\r\none _lak_ of revenue should yield 100 horsemen, and one _krūr_ of\r\nrevenue, 10,000 horsemen, the territories subject to the Pagan (Sangā)\r\nyielding 10 _krūrs_, should yield him 100,000 horse. Many noted pagans\r\nwho hitherto had not helped him in battle, now swelled his ranks out of\r\nhostility to the people of Islām. Ten powerful chiefs, each the leader\r\nof a pagan host, uprose in rebellion, as smoke rises, and linked\r\nthemselves, as though [Sidenote: Fol. 318.] enchained, to that perverse\r\none (Sangā); and this infidel decade who, unlike the blessed ten,[2051]\r\nuplifted misery-freighted standards which _denounce unto them\r\nexcruciating punishment_,[2052] had many dependants, and troops, and\r\nwide-extended lands. As, for instance, Ṣalāḥu'd-dīn[2053] had territory\r\nyielding 30,000 horse, Rāwal Ūdai Sīngh of Bāgar had 12,000, Medinī Rāī\r\nhad 12,000, Ḥasan Khān of Mīwāt had 12,000, Bār-mal of Īdr had 4,000,\r\nNarpat Hāra had 7,000, Satrvī of Kach (Cutch) had 6,000, Dharm-deo had\r\n4,000, Bīr-sing-deo had 4,000, and Maḥmūd Khān, son of Sl. Sikandar, to\r\nwhom, though he possessed neither district nor _pargana_, 10,000 horse\r\nhad gathered in hope of his attaining supremacy. Thus, according to the\r\ncalculation of Hind, 201,000 was the total of those sundered from\r\nsalvation. In brief, that haughty pagan, inwardly blind, and hardened of\r\nheart, having joined with other pagans, dark-fated and doomed to\r\nperdition, advanced to contend with the followers of Islām and to\r\ndestroy the foundations of the law of the Prince of Men (Muḥammad), on\r\nwhom be God's blessing! The protagonists of the royal forces fell, like\r\ndivine destiny, on that one-eyed Dajjāl[2054] who, to understanding men,\r\nshewed the truth of the saying, _When Fate arrives, the eye becomes\r\nblind_, and, setting before their eyes the scripture which saith,\r\n_Whosoever striveth to promote the true religion, striveth for the good\r\nof his own soul_,[2055] [Sidenote: Fol. 318b.] they acted on the precept\r\nto which obedience is due, _Fight against infidels and hypocrites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Military movements._)\r\n\r\n(_March 17th, 1527_) On Saturday the 13th day of the second Jumāda of\r\nthe date 933, a day blessed by the words, _God hath blessed your\r\nSaturday_, the army of Islām was encamped near the village of Kānwa, a\r\ndependency of Bīāna, hard by a hill which was 2 _kurohs_ (4 m.) from the\r\nenemies of the Faith. When those accursed infidel foes of Muḥammad's\r\nreligion heard the reverberation of the armies of Islām, they arrayed\r\ntheir ill-starred forces and moved forward with one heart, relying on\r\ntheir mountain-like, demon-shaped elephants, as had relied the Lords of\r\nthe Elephant[2056] who went to overthrow the sanctuary (_ka`ba_) of\r\nIslām.\r\n\r\n   \"Having these elephants, the wretched Hindus\r\n    Became proud, like the Lords of the Elephant;\r\n    Yet were they odious and vile as is the evening of death,\r\n    Blacker[2057] than night, outnumbering the stars,\r\n    All such as fire is[2058] but their heads upraised\r\n    In hate, as rises its smoke in the azure sky,\r\n    Ant-like they come from right and from left,\r\n    Thousands and thousands of horse and foot.\"\r\n\r\nThey advanced towards the victorious encampment, intending [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 319.] to give battle. The holy warriors of Islām, trees in the\r\ngarden of valour, moved forward in ranks straight as serried pines and,\r\nlike pines uplift their crests to heaven, uplifting their helmet-crests\r\nwhich shone even as shine the hearts of those _that strive in the way of\r\nthe Lord_; their array was like Alexander's iron-wall,[2059] and, as is\r\nthe way of the Prophet's Law, straight and firm and strong, _as though\r\nthey were a well-compacted building_;[2060] and they became fortunate\r\nand successful in accordance with the saying, _They are directed by\r\ntheir Lord, and they shall prosper_.[2061]\r\n\r\n   In that array no rent was frayed by timid souls;\r\n   Firm was it as the Shāhanshāh's resolve, strong as the Faith;\r\n   Their standards brushed against the sky;\r\n   _Verily we have granted thee certain victory_.[2062]\r\n\r\nObeying the cautions of prudence, we imitated the _ghāzīs_ of Rūm[2063]\r\nby posting matchlockmen (_tufanchīān_) and cannoneers (_ra`d-andāzān_)\r\nalong the line of carts which were chained to one another in front of\r\nus; in fact, Islām's army was so arrayed and so steadfast that primal\r\nIntelligence[2064] and the firmament (_`aql-i-pīr u charkh-i-as̤īr_)\r\napplauded the marshalling thereof. To effect this arrangement and\r\norganization, Niẕāmu'd-dīn `Alī Khalīfa, the pillar of the Imperial\r\nfortune, exerted himself strenuously; his efforts were in accord with\r\nDestiny, and were approved by his sovereign's luminous judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Commanders of the centre._)\r\n\r\nHis Majesty's post was in the centre. In the right-hand of the centre\r\nwere stationed the illustrious and most upright [Sidenote: Fol. 319b.]\r\nbrother, the beloved friend of Destiny, the favoured of Him whose aid is\r\nentreated (_i.e._ God), Chīn-tīmūr Sulṯān,[2065]—the illustrious son,\r\naccepted in the sight of the revered Allāh, Sulaimān Shāh,[2066]—the\r\nreservoir of sanctity, the way-shower, Khwāja Kamālu'd-dīn\r\n(Perfect-in-the Faith) Dost-i-khāwand,—the trusted of the sulṯānate, the\r\nabider near the sublime threshold, the close companion, the cream of\r\nassociates, Kamālu'd-dīn Yūnas-i-`alī,—the pillar of royal retainers,\r\nthe perfect in friendship, Jalālu'd-dīn (Glory-of-the-Faith) Shāh Manṣūr\r\n_Barlās_,—the pillar of royal retainers, most excellent of servants,\r\nNiẕāmu'd-dīn (Upholder-of-the-Faith) Darwīsh-i-muḥammad _Sārbān_,—the\r\npillars of royal retainers, the sincere in fidelity, Shihābu'd-dīn\r\n(Meteor-of-the-Faith) `Abdu'l-lāh the librarian and Nīẕāmu'd-dīn Dost\r\nLord-of-the-Gate.\r\n\r\nIn the left-hand of the centre took each his post, the reservoir of\r\nsovereignty, ally of the Khalīfate, object of royal favour, Sulṯān\r\n`Alā'u'd-dīn `Ālam Khān son of Sl. Bahlūl _Lūdī_,—the intimate of\r\nillustrious Majesty, the high priest (_dastūr_) of _ṣadrs_ amongst men,\r\nthe refuge of all people, the pillar of Islām, Shaikh Zain of\r\nKhawāf,[2067]—the pillar of the nobility, Kamālu'd-dīn Muḥibb-i-`alī,\r\nson of the intimate counsellor named above (_i.e._ Khalīfa),—the pillar\r\nof royal retainers, Niẕāmu'd-dīn Tardī Beg brother of Qūj (son of)\r\nAḥmad, whom God hath taken into His mercy,—Shīrafgan [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n320.] son of the above-named Qūj Beg deceased,—the pillar of great ones,\r\nthe mighty khān, Ārāīsh Khān,[2068]—the wazīr, greatest of wazīrs\r\namongst men, Khwāja Kamālu'd-dīn Ḥusain,—and a number of other\r\nattendants at Court (_dīwanīān_).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Commanders of the right wing._)\r\n\r\nIn the right wing was the exalted son, honourable and fortunate, the\r\nbefriended of Destiny, the Star of the Sign of sovereignty and success,\r\nSun of the sphere of the Khalīfate, lauded of slave and free, Muḥammad\r\nHumāyūn Bahādur. On that exalted prince's right hand there were, one\r\nwhose rank approximates to royalty and who is distinguished by the\r\nfavour of the royal giver of gifts, Qāsim-i-ḥusain Sulṯān,—the pillar of\r\nthe nobility Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad-ī-yūsuf _Aūghlāqchī_,[2069]—the trusted\r\nof royalty, most excellent of servants, Jalālu'd-dīn Hindū Beg\r\n_qūchīn_,[2070]—the trusted of royalty, perfect in loyalty, Jalālu'd-dīn\r\nKhusrau Kūkūldāsh,—the trusted of royalty, Qawām (var. Qiyām) Beg\r\n_Aūrdū-shāh_,—the pillar of royal retainers, of perfect sincerity, Walī\r\n_Qarā-qūzī_ the treasurer,[2071]—the pillar of royal retainers,\r\nNiẕāmu'd-dīn Pīr-qulī of Sīstān,—the pillar of wazīrs, Khwāja\r\nKamālu'd-dīn _pahlawān_ (champion) of Badakhshān,—the pillar of royal\r\nretainers, `Abdu'l-sḥakūr,—the pillar of the nobility, most excellent of\r\nservants, the envoy from `Irāq Sulaimān Āqā,—and Ḥusain Āqā the envoy\r\nfrom Sīstān. On [Sidenote: Fol. 320b.] the victory-crowned left of the\r\nfortunate son already named there were, the sayyid of lofty birth, of\r\nthe family of Murtiẓā (`Alī), Mīr Hama (or Hāma),—the pillar of royal\r\nretainers, the perfect in sincerity, Shamsu'd-dīn Muḥammadī Kūkūldāsh\r\nand Niẕāmu'd-dīn Khwājagī Asad _jān-dār_.[2072] In the right wing there\r\nwere, of the amīrs of Hind,—the pillar of the State, the Khān-of-Khāns,\r\nDilāwar Khān,[2073]—the pillar of the nobility, Malik Dād\r\n_Kararānī_,—and the pillar of the nobility, the Shaikh-of-shaikhs,\r\nShaikh Gūran, each standing in his appointed place.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Commanders of the left wing._)\r\n\r\nIn the left wing of the armies of Islām there extended their ranks,—the\r\nlord of lofty lineage, the refuge of those in authority, the ornament of\r\nthe family of _T̤a Ha_ and _Ya Sin_,[2074] the model for the descendants\r\nof the prince of ambassadors (Muḥammad), Sayyid Mahdī Khwāja,—the\r\nexalted and fortunate brother, the well-regarded of his Majesty,\r\nMuḥammad Sl. Mīrzā,[2075]—the personage approximating to royalty, the\r\ndescended of monarchs, `Ādil Sulṯān son of Mahdī Sulṯān,[2076]—the\r\ntrusted in the State, perfect in attachment, `Abdu'l-'azīz Master of the\r\nHorse,—the trusted in the State, the pure in friendship, Shamsu'd-dīn\r\nMuḥammad `Ali _Jang-jang_,[2077]—the pillar of royal retainers,\r\nJalālu'd-dīn Qūtlūq-qadam _qarāwal_ (scout),—the pillar of royal\r\nretainers, the perfect in sincerity, Jalālu'd-dīn Shāh Ḥusain _yārāgī\r\nMughūl Ghānchī_(?),[2078]—and Niẕāmu'd-dīn Jān-i-muḥammad _Beg Ātāka_.\r\n\r\nOf amīrs of Hind there were in this division, the scions of sulṯāns,\r\nKamāl Khān and Jamāl Khān sons of the Sl. `Alā'u'd-dīn [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n321.] above-mentioned,—the most excellent officer `Alī Khān Shaikh-zāda\r\nof Farmūl,—and the pillar of the nobility, Niẕām Khān of Bīāna.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. The flanking parties._)\r\n\r\nFor the flank-movement (_tūlghāma_) of the right wing there were posted\r\ntwo of the most trusted of the household retainers, Tardīka[2079] and\r\nMalik Qāsim the brother of Bābā Qashqa, with a body of Mughūls; for the\r\nflank-movement of the left wing were the two trusted chiefs Mūmin Ātāka\r\nand Rustam _Turkmān_, leading a body of special troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. The Chief of the Staff._)\r\n\r\nThe pillar of royal retainers, the perfect in loyalty, the cream of\r\nprivy-counsellors, Niẕāmu'd-dīn Sulṯān Muḥammad _Bakhshī_, after posting\r\nthe _ghāzīs_ of Islām, came to receive the royal commands. He despatched\r\nadjutants (_tawāchī_) and messengers (_yasāwal_) in various directions\r\nto convey imperative orders concerning the marshalling of the troops to\r\nthe great sulṯāns and amīrs. And when the Commanders had taken up their\r\npositions, an imperative order was given that none should quit his post\r\nor, uncommanded, stretch forth his arm to fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. The battle._)\r\n\r\nOne watch[2080] of the afore-mentioned day had elapsed when the opposing\r\nforces approached each other and the battle began. As Light opposes\r\nDarkness, so did the centres of the two [Sidenote: Fol. 321b.] armies\r\noppose one another. Fighting began on the right and left wings, such\r\nfighting as shook the Earth and filled highest Heaven with clangour.\r\n\r\nThe left wing of the ill-fated pagans advanced against the right wing of\r\nthe Faith-garbed troops of Islām and charged down on Khusrau Kūkūldāsh\r\nand Bābā Qashqa's brother Malik Qāsim. The most glorious and most\r\nupright brother Chīn-tīmūr Sulṯān, obeying orders, went to reinforce\r\nthem and, engaging in the conflict with bold attack, bore the pagans\r\nback almost to the rear of their centre. Guerdon was made for the\r\nbrother's glorious fame.[2081] The marvel of the Age, Muṣṯafa of Rūm,\r\nhad his post in the centre (of the right wing) where was the exalted\r\nson, upright and fortunate, the object of the favourable regard of\r\nCreative Majesty (_i.e._ God), the one _distinguished by the particular\r\ngrace of the mighty Sovereign who commands to do and not to do_ (_i.e._\r\nBābur), Muḥammad Humāyūn Bahādur. This Muṣṯafa of Rūm had the carts\r\n(_arābahā_)[2082] brought forward and broke the ranks of pagans with\r\nmatchlock and culverin dark like their hearts(?).[2083] In the thick of\r\nthe fight, the most glorious brother Qāsim-i-ḥusain Sulṯān and the\r\npillars of royal retainers, Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad-i-yūsuf and Qawām Beg,\r\nobeying orders, hastened to their help. And since band after band of\r\npagan troops followed each other to help their men, so we, in our turn,\r\nsent the trusted in the State, the glory of the Faith, Hindū Beg, and,\r\nafter him, the pillars of the nobility, Muhammadī Kūkūldāsh and Khwājagī\r\nAsad _jān-dār_, and, after them, the trusted in [Sidenote: Fol. 322.]\r\nthe State, the trustworthy in the resplendent Court, the most\r\nconfided-in of nobles, the elect of confidential servants, Yūnas-i-'alī,\r\ntogether with the pillar of the nobility, the perfect in friendship,\r\nShāh Manṣūr _Barlās_ and the pillar of the grandees, the pure in\r\nfidelity, `Abdu'l-lāh the librarian, and after these, the pillar of the\r\nnobles, Dost the Lord-of-the-Gate, and Muḥammad Khalil the master-gelder\r\n(_akhta-begī_).[2084]\r\n\r\nThe pagan right wing made repeated and desperate attack on the left wing\r\nof the army of Islām, falling furiously on the holy warriors, possessors\r\nof salvation, but each time was made to turn back or, smitten with the\r\narrows of victory, was _made to descend into Hell, the house of\r\nperdition; they shall be thrown to burn therein, and an unhappy dwelling\r\nshall it be_.[2085] Then the trusty amongst the nobles, Mūmin Ātāka and\r\nRustam _Turkmān_ betook themselves to the rear[2086] of the host of\r\ndarkened pagans; and to help them were sent the Commanders Khwāja Maḥmūd\r\nand `Alī Ātāka, servants of him who amongst the royal retainers is near\r\nthe throne, the trusted of the Sulṯānate, Niẕāmu'd-din `Alī Khalīfa.\r\n\r\nOur high-born brother[2087] Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā, and the representative\r\nof royal dignity, `Ādil Sulṯān, and the trusted in the State, the\r\nstrengthener of the Faith, `Abdu'l-`azīz, the Master of the Horse, and\r\nthe glory of the Faith, Qūtlūq-qadam _qarāwal_, and the meteor of the\r\nFaith, Muḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang_, and the pillar of royal retainers,\r\nShāh Ḥusain _yāragī Mughūl Ghānchī_(?) stretched out the arm to fight\r\nand stood firm. To support them we sent the _Dastūr_, the highest of\r\nwazīrs, Khwāja [Sidenote: Fol. 322b.] Kamālu'd-dīn Ḥusain with a body of\r\n_dīwānīs_.[2088] Every holy warrior was eager to show his zeal, entering\r\nthe fight with desperate joy as if approving the verse, _Say, Do you\r\nexpect any other should befall us than one of the two most excellent\r\nthings, victory or martyrdom?_[2089] and, with display of life-devotion,\r\nuplifted the standard of life-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAs the conflict and battle lasted long, an imperative order was issued\r\nthat the special royal corps (_tābīnān-i-khāṣa-i-pādshāhī_)[2090] who,\r\nheroes of one hue,[2091] were standing, like tigers enchained, behind\r\nthe carts,[2092] should go out on the right and the left of the\r\ncentre,[2093] leaving the matchlockmen's post in-between, and join\r\nbattle on both sides. As the True Dawn emerges from its cleft in the\r\nhorizon, so they emerged from behind the carts; they poured a ruddy\r\ncrepuscule of the blood of those ill-fated pagans on the nadir of the\r\nHeavens, that battle-field; they made fall from the firmament of\r\nexistence many heads of the headstrong, as stars fall from the firmament\r\nof heaven. The marvel of the Age, Ustād `Alī-qulī, who with his own\r\nappurtenances stood in front of the centre, did deeds of valour,\r\ndischarging against the iron-mantled forts of the infidels[2094] stones\r\nof such size that were (one) put into a scale of the Balance in which\r\nactions are weighed, that _scale shall be heavy with good works and he_\r\n(_i.e._ its owner) _shall lead a pleasing life_[2095]; and were such\r\nstones discharged against a hill, broad of base and high of summit, it\r\nwould _become like carded wool_.[2096] Such stones Ustād `Alī-qulī\r\ndischarged at the iron-clad fortress of the pagan ranks and by this\r\ndischarge of stones, and abundance of culverins and matchlocks(?)[2097]\r\ndestroyed many of the builded bodies of the [Sidenote: Fol. 323.]\r\npagans. The matchlockmen of the royal centre, in obedience to orders,\r\ngoing from behind the carts into the midst of the battle, each one of\r\nthem made many a pagan taste of the poison of death. The foot-soldiers,\r\ngoing into a most dangerous place, made their names to be blazoned\r\namongst those of the forest-tigers (_i.e._ heroes) of valour and the\r\nchampions in the field of manly deeds. Just at this time came an order\r\nfrom his Majesty the Khāqān that the carts of the centre should be\r\nadvanced; and the gracious royal soul (_i.e._ Bābur) moved towards the\r\npagan soldiers, Victory and Fortune on his right, Prestige and Conquest\r\non his left. On witnessing this event, the victorious troops followed\r\nfrom all sides; the whole surging ocean of the army rose in mighty\r\nwaves; the courage of all the crocodiles[2098] of that ocean was\r\nmanifested by the strength of their deeds; an obscuring cloud of dust\r\no'erspread the sky(?). The dust that gathered over the battle-field was\r\ntraversed by the lightning-flashes of the sword; the Sun's face was\r\nshorn of light as is a mirror's back; the striker and the struck, the\r\nvictor and the vanquished were commingled, all distinction between them\r\nlost. The Wizard of Time produced such a night that its only planets\r\nwere arrows,[2099] its only constellations of fixed stars were the\r\nsteadfast squadrons.\r\n\r\n   Upon that day of battle sank and rose\r\n   Blood to the Fish and dust-clouds to the Moon,\r\n   While through the horse-hoofs on that spacious plain,\r\n     [Sidenote: Fol. 323b.]\r\n   One Earth flew up to make another Heaven.[2100]\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the holy warriors were heedlessly flinging away\r\ntheir lives, they heard a secret voice say, _Be not dismayed, neither be\r\ngrieved, for, if ye believe, ye shall be exalted above the\r\nunbelievers_,[2101] and from the infallible Informer heard the joyful\r\nwords, _Assistance is from God, and a speedy victory! And do thou bear\r\nglad tidings to true believers._[2102] Then they fought with such\r\ndelight that the plaudits of the saints of the Holy Assembly reached\r\nthem and the angels from near the Throne, fluttered round their heads\r\nlike moths. Between the first and second Prayers, there was such blaze\r\nof combat that the flames thereof raised standards above the heavens,\r\nand the right and left of the army of Islām rolled back the left and\r\nright of the doomed infidels in one mass upon their centre.\r\n\r\nWhen signs were manifest of the victory of the Strivers and of the\r\nup-rearing of the standards of Islām, those accursed infidels and wicked\r\nunbelievers remained for one hour confounded. At length, their hearts\r\nabandoning life, they fell upon the right and left of our centre. Their\r\nattack on the left was the more vigorous and there they approached\r\nfurthest, but the holy warriors, their minds set on the reward, planted\r\nshoots (_nihāl_) of arrows in the field of the breast of each one of\r\nthem, and, such being their gloomy fate, overthrew them. In this state\r\nof affairs, the breezes of victory and fortune blew over the meadow of\r\nour [Sidenote: Fol. 324.] happy Nawāb, and brought the good news,\r\n_Verily we have granted thee a manifest victory_.[2103] And Victory the\r\nbeautiful woman (_shāhid_) whose world-adornment of waving tresses was\r\nembellished by _God will aid you with a mighty aid_,[2104] bestowed on\r\nus the good fortune that had been hidden behind a veil, and made it a\r\nreality. The absurd (_bāṯil_) Hindūs, knowing their position perilous,\r\n_dispersed like carded wool before the wind_, and _like moths scattered\r\nabroad_.[2105] Many fell dead on the field of battle; others, desisting\r\nfrom fighting, fled to the desert of exile and became the food of crows\r\nand kites. Mounds were made of the bodies of the slain, pillars of their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Hindū chiefs killed in the battle._)\r\n\r\nḤasan Khān of Mīwāt was enrolled in the list of the dead by the force of\r\na matchlock (_ẓarb-i-tufak_); most of those headstrong chiefs of tribes\r\nwere slain likewise, and ended their days by arrow and matchlock (_tīr u\r\ntufak_). Of their number was Rāwal Ūdī Sīngh of Bāgar,[2106] ruler\r\n(_wālī_) of the Dungarpūr country, who had 12,000 horse, Rāī Chandrabān\r\n_Chūhān_ who had 4,000 horse, Bhūpat Rāo son of that Ṣalāḥu'd-dīn\r\nalready mentioned, who was lord of Chandīrī and had 6,000 horse,\r\nMānik-chand _Chūhān_ and Dilpat Rāo who had each 4,000 horse, Kankū (or\r\nGangū) and Karm Sīngh and Dankūsī(?)[2107] who had each 3,000 horse, and\r\na number of others, each one of whom was leader of a great [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 324b.] command, a splendid and magnificent chieftain. All these\r\ntrod the road to Hell, removing from this house of clay to the pit of\r\nperdition. The enemy's country (_dāru'l-ḥarb_) was full, as Hell is\r\nfull, of wounded who had died on the road. The lowest pit was gorged\r\nwith miscreants who had surrendered their souls to the lord of Hell. In\r\nwhatever direction one from the army of Islām hastened, he found\r\neverywhere a self-willed one dead; whatever march the illustrious camp\r\nmade in the wake of the fugitives, it found no foot-space without its\r\nprostrate foe.\r\n\r\n   All the Hindūs slain, abject (_khwār_, var. _zār_) and mean,\r\n   By matchlock-stones, like the Elephants' lords,[2108]\r\n   Many hills of their bodies were seen,\r\n   And from each hill a fount of running blood.\r\n   Dreading the arrows of (our) splendid ranks,\r\n   Passed[2109] they in flight to each waste and hill.\r\n\r\nThey turn their backs. The command of God is to be performed. Now praise\r\nbe to God, All-hearing and All-wise, for victory is from God alone, the\r\nMighty, the Wise.[2110] Written Jumāda II. 25th 933 (AH.-March 29th 1527\r\nA.D.).[2111]\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR SEQUELS OF VICTORY.\r\n\r\n(_a. Bābur assumes the title of Ghāzī._)\r\n\r\nAfter this success _Ghāzī_ (Victor in a Holy-war) was written amongst\r\nthe royal titles.\r\n\r\nBelow the titles (_ṯughrā_)[2112] entered on the _Fatḥ-nāma_, I wrote\r\nthe following quatrain:—[2113]\r\n\r\n   For Islām's sake, I wandered in the wilds,\r\n   Prepared for war with pagans and Hindūs,\r\n   Resolved myself to meet the martyr's death. [Sidenote: Fol. 325.]\r\n   Thanks be to God! a _ghāzī_ I became.\r\n\r\n(_b. Chronograms of the victory._)\r\n\r\nShaikh Zain had found (_tāpīb aīdī_) the words\r\n_Fatḥ-i-pādshāḥ-i-islām_[2114] (Victory of the Pādshāh of the Faith) to\r\nbe a chronogram of the victory. Mīr Gesū, one of the people come from\r\nKābul, had also found these same words to be a chronogram, had composed\r\nthem in a quatrain and sent this to me. It was a coincidence that Shaikh\r\nZain and Mīr Gesū should bring forward precisely the same words in the\r\nquatrains they composed to embellish their discoveries.[2115] Once\r\nbefore when Shaikh Zain found the date of the victory at Dībālpūr in the\r\nwords _Wasaṯ-i-shahr Rabī`u'l-awwal_[2116] (Middle of the month Rabī`\r\nI.), Mīr Gesū had found it in the very same words.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NARRATIVE RESUMED.\r\n\r\n(_a. After the victory._)\r\n\r\nThe foes beaten, we hurried them off, dismounting one after another. The\r\nPagan's encirclement[2117] may have been 2 _kurohs_ from our camp\r\n(_aūrdū_); when we reached his camp (_aūrdū_), we sent Muḥammadī,\r\n`Abdu'l-`azīz, `Alī Khān and some others in pursuit of him. There was a\r\nlittle slackness;[2118] I ought to have gone myself, and not have left\r\nthe matter to what I expected from other people. When I had gone as much\r\nas a _kuroh_ (2 m.) beyond the Pagan's camp, I turned back because it\r\nwas late in the day; I came to our camp at the Bed-time Prayer.\r\n\r\nWith what ill-omened words Muḥammad Sharīf the astrologer had fretted\r\nme! Yet he came at once to congratulate me! I emptied my inwards[2119]\r\nin abuse of him, but, spite of his being heathenish, ill-omened of\r\nspeech, extremely self-satisfied, and a most disagreeable person, I\r\nbestowed a _lak_ upon him because there had been deserving service from\r\nhim in former times, and, [Sidenote: Fol. 325b.] after saying he was not\r\nto stay in my dominions, I gave him leave to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Suppression of a rebellion._)\r\n\r\n(_March 17th_) We remained next day (_Jumāda II. 14th_) on that\r\nsame ground. Muḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang_ and Shaikh Gūran and\r\n`Abdu'l-malik[2120] the armourer were sent off with a dense (_qālīn_)\r\narmy against Ilīās Khān who, having rebelled in Between-the-two-waters\r\n(Ganges and Jumna), had taken Kūl (Koel) and made Kīchīk `Alī\r\nprisoner.[2121] He could not fight when they came up; his force\r\nscattered in all directions; he himself was taken a few days later and\r\nbrought into Āgra where I had him flayed alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. A trophy of victory._)\r\n\r\nAn order was given to set up a pillar of pagan heads on the infant-hill\r\n(_koh-bacha_) between which and our camp the battle had been fought.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Bīāna visited._)\r\n\r\n(_March 20th_) Marching on from that ground, and after halting on two\r\nnights, we reached Bīāna (_Sunday_, _Jumāda II. 17th_). Countless\r\nnumbers of the bodies of pagans and apostates[2122] who had fallen in\r\ntheir flight, lay on the road as far as Bīāna, indeed as far as Alūr and\r\nMīwāt.[2123]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Discussion of plans._)\r\n\r\nOn our return to camp, I summoned the Turk amīrs and the amīrs of Hind\r\nto a consultation about moving into the Pagan (Sangā)'s country; the\r\nplan was given up because of the little water and much heat on the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Mīwāt._)\r\n\r\nNear Dihlī lies the Mīwāt country which yields revenue of 3 or 4\r\n_krūrs_.[2124] Ḥasan Khān _Mīwātī_[2125] and his ancestors one after\r\nanother had ruled it with absolute sway for a hundred years or two. They\r\nmust have made[2126] imperfect submission to the Dihlī Sulṯāns; the\r\nSulṯāns of Hind,[2127] whether because their [Sidenote: Fol. 326.] own\r\ndominions were wide, or because their opportunity was narrow, or because\r\nof the Mīwāt hill-country,[2128] did not turn in the Mīwāt direction,\r\ndid not establish order in it, but just put up with this amount of\r\n(imperfect) submission. For our own part, we did after the fashion of\r\nearlier Sulṯāns; having conquered Hind, we shewed favour to Ḥasan Khān,\r\nbut that thankless and heathenish apostate disregarded our kindness and\r\nbenefits, was not grateful for favour and promotion, but became the\r\nmover of all disturbance and the cause of all misdoing.\r\n\r\nWhen, as has been mentioned, we abandoned the plan (against Rānā Sangā),\r\nwe moved to subdue Mīwāt. Having made 4 night-halts on the way, we\r\ndismounted on the bank of the Mānas-nī[2129] 6 _kurohs_ (12 m.) from\r\nAlūr, the present seat of government in Mīwāt. Ḥasan Khān and his\r\nforefathers must have had their seat[2130] in Tijāra, but when I turned\r\ntowards Hindūstan, beat Pahār (or Bihār) Khān and took Lāhor and\r\nDībālpūr (930 AH.-1524 AD.), he bethought himself betimes and busied\r\nhimself for a residence (_`imārat_) in Fort Alūr (Alwar).\r\n\r\nHis trusted man, Karm-chand by name, who had come from him to me in Āgra\r\nwhen his son (Nāhar _i.e._ Tiger) was with me there,[2131] came now from\r\nthat son's presence in Alūr and asked [Sidenote: Fol. 326b.] for peace.\r\n`Abdu'r-raḥīm _shaghāwal_ went with him to Alūr, conveying letters of\r\nroyal favour, and returned bringing Nāhar Khān who was restored to\r\nfavour and received _parganas_ worth several _laks_ for his support.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Rewards to officers._)\r\n\r\nThinking, \"What good work Khusrau did in the battle!\" I named him for\r\nAlūr and gave him 50 _laks_ for his support, but unluckily for himself,\r\nhe put on airs and did not accept this. Later on it [_khẉud_, itself]\r\ncame to be known that Chīn-tīmūr must have done[2132] that work; guerdon\r\nwas made him for his renown(?);[2133] Tijāra-town, the seat of\r\ngovernment in Mīwāt, was bestowed on him together with an allowance of\r\n50 _laks_ for his support.\r\n\r\nAlūr and an allowance of 15 _laks_ was bestowed on Tardīka (or, Tardī\r\n_yakka_) who in the flanking-party of the right-hand (_qūl_) had done\r\nbetter than the rest. The contents of the Alūr treasury were bestowed on\r\nHumāyūn.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Alwar visited._)\r\n\r\n(_April 13th_) Marching from that camp on Wednesday the 1st of the month\r\nof Rajab, we came to within 2 _kurohs_ (4 m.) of Alūr. I went to see the\r\nfort, there spent the night, and next day went back to camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Leave given to various followers._)\r\n\r\nWhen the oath before-mentioned[2134] was given to great and small before\r\nthe Holy-battle with Rānā Sangā, it had been mentioned[2135] that there\r\nwould be nothing to hinder leave after [Sidenote: Fol. 327.] this\r\nvictory, and that leave would be given to anyone wishing to go away\r\n(from Hindūstān). Most of Humāyūn's men were from Badakhshān or\r\nelsewhere on that side (of Hindū-kūsh); they had never before been of an\r\narmy led out for even a month or two; there had been weakness amongst\r\nthem before the fight; on these accounts and also because Kābul was\r\nempty of troops, it was now decided to give Humāyūn leave for Kābul.\r\n\r\n(_April 11th_) Leaving the matter at this, we marched from Alūr on\r\nThursday the 9th of Rajab, did 4 or 5 _kurohs_ (8-10 m.) and dismounted\r\non the bank of the Mānas-water.\r\n\r\nMahdī Khwāja also had many discomforts; he too was given leave for\r\nKābul. The military-collectorate of Bīāna [he held] was bestowed on Dost\r\nLord-of-the-gate, and, as previously Etāwa had been named for Mahdī\r\nKhwāja,[2136] Mahdī Khwāja's son Ja`far Khwāja was sent there in his\r\nfather's place when (later) Quṯb Khān abandoned it and went off.[2137]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Despatch of the Letter-of-victory._)\r\n\r\nBecause of the leave given to Humāyūn, two or three days were spent on\r\nthis ground. From it Mūmin-i-`alī the messenger (_tawāchī_) was sent off\r\nfor Kābul with the _Fatḥ-nāma_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Excursions and return to Āgra._)\r\n\r\nPraise had been heard of the Fīrūzpūr-spring and of the great lake of\r\nKūtila.[2138] Leaving the camp on that same ground, I rode out on Sunday\r\n(_Rajab 12th-April 14th_) both to visit [Sidenote: Fol. 327b.] these\r\nplaces and to set Humāyūn on his way. After visiting Fīrūzpūr and its\r\nspring on that same day, _ma'jūn_ was eaten. In the valley where the\r\nspring rises, oleanders (_kanīr_) were in bloom; the place is not\r\nwithout charm but is over-praised. I ordered a reservoir of hewn stone,\r\n10 by 10[2139] to be made where the water widened, spent the night in\r\nthat valley, next day rode on and visited the Kūtila lake. It is\r\nsurrounded by mountain-skirts. The Mānas-nī is heard-say to go into\r\nit.[2140] It is a very large lake, from its one side the other side is\r\nnot well seen. In the middle of it is rising ground. At its sides are\r\nmany small boats, by going off in which the villagers living near it are\r\nsaid to escape from any tumult or disturbance. Even on our arrival a few\r\npeople went in them to the middle of the lake.\r\n\r\nOn our way back from the lake, we dismounted in Humāyūn's camp. There we\r\nrested and ate food, and after having put robes of honour on him and his\r\nbegs, bade him farewell at the Bed-time Prayer, and rode on. We slept\r\nfor a little at some place on the road, at shoot of day passed through\r\nthe _pargana_ of Kharī, again slept a little, and at length got to our\r\ncamp which had dismounted at Toda-(bhim).[2141] After leaving Toda, we\r\ndismounted at Sūnkār; there Ḥasan Khān _Mīwātī's_ son [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n328.] Nāhar Khān escaped from `Abdu'r-raḥīm's charge.\r\n\r\nGoing on from that place, we halted one night, then dismounted at a\r\nspring situated on the bill of a mountain between Busāwar and\r\nChausa[2142] (or Jūsa); there awnings were set up and we committed the\r\nsin of _ma'jūn_. When the army had passed by this spring, Tardī Beg\r\n_khāksār_ had praised it; he (or we) had come and seen it from on\r\nhorse-back (_sar-asbgi_) and passed on. It is a perfect spring. In\r\nHindūstān where there are never running-waters,[2143] people seek out\r\nthe springs themselves. The rare springs that are found, come oozing\r\ndrop by drop (_āb-zih_) out of the ground, not bubbling up like springs\r\nof those lands.[2144] From this spring comes about a half-mill-water. It\r\nbubbles up on the hill-skirt; meadows lie round it; it is very\r\nbeautiful. I ordered an octagonal reservoir of hewn stone made\r\nabove[2145] it. While we were at the border of the spring, under the\r\nsoothing influence of _ma'jūn_, Tardī Beg, contending for its surpassing\r\nbeauty, said again and again, (_Persian_) \"Since I am celebrating the\r\nbeauty of the place,[2146] a name ought to be settled for it\".\r\n`Abdu'l-lāh said, \"It must be called the Royal-spring approved of by\r\nTardī Beg.\" This saying caused much joke and laughter.\r\n\r\nDost Lord-of-the-gate coming up from Bīāna, waited on me at this\r\nspring-head. Leaving this place, we visited Bīāna again, [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n328b.] went on to Sīkrī, dismounted there at the side of a garden which\r\nhad been ordered made, stayed two days supervising the garden, and on\r\nThursday the 23rd of Rajab (_April 25th_), reached Āgra.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Chandwār and Rāprī regained._)\r\n\r\nDuring recent disturbances, the enemy, as has been mentioned,[2147] had\r\npossessed themselves of Chandwār[2148] and Rāprī. Against those places\r\nwe now sent Muḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang_, Qūj Beg's (brother) Tardī Beg,\r\n`Abdu'l-malik the armourer, and Ḥasan Khān with his Daryā-khānīs. When\r\nthey were near Chandwār, Quṯb Khān's people in it got out and away. Our\r\nmen laid hands on it, and passed on to Rāprī. Here Ḥusain Khān\r\n_Nūḥānī's_ people came to the lane-end[2149] thinking to fight a little,\r\ncould not stand the attack of our men, and took to flight. Ḥusain Khān\r\nhimself with a few followers went into the Jūn-river (Jumna) on an\r\nelephant and was drowned. Quṯb Khān, for his part, abandoned Etāwa on\r\nhearing these news, fled with a few and got away. Etāwa having been\r\nnamed for Mahdī Khwāja, his son Ja`far Khwāja was sent there in his\r\nplace.[2150]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Apportionment of fiefs._)\r\n\r\nWhen Rānā Sangā sallied out against us, most Hindūstānīs and Afghāns, as\r\nhas been mentioned,[2151] turned round against us and took possession of\r\ntheir _parganas_ and districts.[2152]\r\n\r\nSl. Muḥammad _Dūldāī_ who had abandoned Qanūj and come [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n329.] to me, would not agree to go there again, whether from fear or for\r\nhis reputation's sake; he therefore exchanged the 30 _laks_ of Qanūj for\r\nthe 15 of Sihrind, and Qanūj was bestowed with an allowance of 30 _laks_\r\non Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā. Badāūn[2153] was given to Qāsim-i-ḥusain Sulṯān\r\nand he was sent against Bīban who had laid siege to Luknūr[2154] during\r\nthe disturbance with Rānā Sangā, together with Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā, and,\r\nof Turk amīrs, Bābā Qashqa's Malik Qāsim with his elder and younger\r\nbrethren and his Mughūls, and Abū'l-muḥammad the lance-player, and\r\nMu'yad with his father's Daryā-khānīs and those of Ḥusain Khān\r\n_Daryā-khānī_ and the retainers of Sl. Muḥammad _Dūldāī_, and again, of\r\namīrs of Hind, `Alī Khān _Farmūlī_ and Malik Dād _Kararānī_ and Shaikh\r\nMuḥammad of Shaikh _Bhakhārī_(?) and Tātār Khān Khān-i-jahān.\r\n\r\nAt the time this army was crossing the Gang-river (Ganges), Bīban,\r\nhearing about it, fled, abandoning his baggage. Our army followed him to\r\nKhairābād,[2155] stayed there a few days and then turned back.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. Appointments and dispersion for the Rains._)\r\n\r\nAfter the treasure had been shared out,[2156] Rānā Sangā's great affair\r\nintervened before districts and _parganas_ were apportioned. During the\r\nrespite now from Holy-war against the Pagan (Sangā), this apportionment\r\nwas made. As the Rains were near, it was settled for every-one to go to\r\nhis _pargana_, get equipment [Sidenote: Fol. 329b.] ready, and be\r\npresent when the Rains were over.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. Misconduct of Humāyūn._)\r\n\r\nMeantime news came that Humāyūn had gone into Dihlī, there opened\r\nseveral treasure-houses and, without permission, taken possession of\r\ntheir contents. I had never looked for such a thing from him; it grieved\r\nme very much; I wrote and sent off to him very severe reproaches.[2157]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. An embassy to `Irāq._)\r\n\r\nKhwājagī Asad who had already gone as envoy to `Irāq and returned with\r\nSulaimān _Turkmān_,[2158] was again joined with him and on the 15th of\r\nSha`bān (_May 17th_) sent with befitting gifts to Shāh-zāda T̤ahmāsp.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_q. Tardī Beg khāksār resigns service._)\r\n\r\nI had brought Tardī Beg out from the darwīsh-life and made a soldier of\r\nhim; for how many years had he served me! Now his desire for the\r\ndarwīsh-life was overmastering and he asked for leave. It was given and\r\nhe was sent as an envoy to Kāmrān conveying 3 _laks_ from the Treasury\r\nfor him.[2159]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_r. Lines addressed to deserting friends._)\r\n\r\nA little fragment[2160] had been composed suiting the state of those who\r\nhad gone away during the past year; I now addressed it to Mullā `Alī\r\nKhān and sent it to him by Tardī Beg. It is as follows:—[2161]\r\n\r\n   Ah you who have gone from this country of Hind,\r\n   [Sidenote: Fol. 330.] Aware for yourselves of its woe and its pain,\r\n   With longing desire for Kābul's fine air,\r\n   You went hot-foot forth out of Hind.\r\n   The pleasure you looked for you will have found there\r\n   With sociable ease and charm and delight;\r\n   As for us, God be thanked! we still are alive,\r\n   In spite of much pain and unending distress;\r\n   Pleasures of sense and bodily toil\r\n   Have been passed-by by you, passed-by too by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_s. Of the Ramẓān Feast._)\r\n\r\nRamẓān was spent this year with ablution and _tarāwiḥ_[2162] in the\r\nGarden-of-eight-paradises. Since my 11th year I had not kept the Ramẓān\r\nFeast for two successive years in the same place; last year I had kept\r\nit in Āgra; this year, saying, \"Don't break the rule!\" I went on the\r\nlast day of the month to keep it in Sīkrī. Tents were set up on a stone\r\nplatform made on the n.e. side of the Garden-of-victory which is now\r\nbeing laid out at Sīkrī, and in them the Feast was held.[2163]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_t. Playing cards._)\r\n\r\nThe night we left Āgra Mīr `Alī the armourer was sent to Shāh Ḥasan\r\n(_Arghūn_) in Tatta to take him playing-cards [_ganjīfa_] he much liked\r\nand had asked for.[2164]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_u. Illness and a tour._)\r\n\r\n(_August 3rd_) On Sunday the 5th of Ẕū'l-qa`da I fell ill; the illness\r\nlasted 17 days.\r\n\r\n(_August 24th_) On Friday the 24th of the same month we set out to visit\r\nDūlpūr. That night I slept at a place half-way; [Sidenote: Fol. 330b.]\r\nreached Sikandar's dam[2165] at dawn, and dismounted there.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the hill below the dam the rock is of building-stone. I\r\nhad Ustād Shāh Muḥammad the stone-cutter brought and gave him an order\r\nthat if a house could be cut all in one piece in that rock, it was to be\r\ndone, but that if the rock were too low for a residence (_`imārat_), it\r\nwas to be levelled and have a reservoir, all in one piece, cut out of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFrom Dūlpūr we went on to visit Bārī. Next morning (_August 26th_) I\r\nrode out from Bārī through the hills between it and the Chaṃbal-river in\r\norder to view the river. This done I went back to Bārī. In these hills\r\nwe saw the ebony-tree, the fruit of which people call _tindū_. It is\r\nsaid that there are white ebony-trees also and that most ebony-trees in\r\nthese hills are of this kind.[2166] On leaving Bārī we went to Sīkrī; we\r\nreached Āgra on the 29th of the same month (_August 28th_).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_v. Doubts about Shaikh Bāyazīd Farmūlī._)\r\n\r\nAs in these days people were telling wild news about Shaikh Bāyazīd, Sl.\r\nQulī _Turk_ was sent to him to give him tryst[2167] in 20 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_w. Religious and metrical exercises._)\r\n\r\n(_August 28th_) On Friday the 2nd of Ẕū'l-ḥijja I began what one is made\r\nto read 41 times.[2168]\r\n\r\nIn these same days I cut up [_taqṯi`_] the following couplet of mine\r\ninto 504 measures[2169]:—\r\n\r\n   \"Shall I tell of her eye or her brow, her fire or her speech?\r\n   Shall I tell of her stature or cheek, of her hair or her waist?\"\r\n\r\nOn this account a treatise[2170] was arranged.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_x. Return of illness._)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 331.] On this day (_i.e._ 2nd Ẕū'l-ḥijja) I fell ill\r\nagain; the illness lasted nine days.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_y. Start for Saṃbal._)\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 24th_) On Thursday the 29th of Ẕū'l-ḥijja we rode out for an\r\nexcursion to Kūl and Saṃbal.\r\n\r\n\r\n934 AH.-SEP. 27TH 1527 TO SEP. 15TH 1528 AD.[2171]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Visit to Kūl (Aligarh) and Saṃbal._)\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 27th_) On Saturday the 1st of Muḥarram we dismounted in Kūl\r\n(Koel). Humāyūn had left Darwīsh(-i-`alī) and Yūsuf-i-`alī[2172] in\r\nSaṃbal; they crossed one river,[2173] fought Quṯb _Sīrwānī_[2174] and a\r\nparty of rājas, beat them well and killed a mass of men. They sent a few\r\nheads and an elephant into Kūl while we were there. After we had gone\r\nabout Kūl for two days, we dismounted at Shaikh Gūran's house by his\r\ninvitation, where he entertained us hospitably and laid an offering\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 30th-Muḥ. 4th_) Riding on from that place, we dismounted at\r\nAūtrūlī (Atrauli).[2175]\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 1st-Muḥ. 5th_) On Wednesday we crossed the river Gang (Ganges)\r\nand spent the night in villages of Saṃbal.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 2nd-Muḥ. 6th_) On Thursday we dismounted in Saṃbal. After going\r\nabout in it for two days, we left on Saturday.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 5th-Muḥ. 9th_) On Sunday we dismounted in Sikandara[2176]\r\n\r\nat the house of Rāo _Sīrwānī_ who set food before us and served us.\r\nWhen we rode out at dawn, I made some pretext to leave the rest, and\r\ngalloped on alone to within a _kuroh_ of Āgra where they overtook me. At\r\nthe Mid-day Prayer we dismounted in Āgra.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Illness of Bābur._)\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 12th_) On Sunday the 16th of Muḥarram I had fever and ague. This\r\nreturned again and again during the next 25 or 26 days. I drank\r\noperative medicine and at last relief came. I suffered much from thirst\r\nand want of sleep.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 331b.] While I was ill, I composed a quatrain or two;\r\nhere is one of them:—[2177]\r\n\r\n   Fever grows strong in my body by day,\r\n   Sleep quits my eyes as night comes on;\r\n   Like to my pain and my patience the pair,\r\n   For while that goes waxing, this wanes.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Arrival of kinswomen._)\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 23rd_) On Saturday the 28th of Ṣafar there arrived two of the\r\npaternal-aunt begīms, Fakhr-i-jahān Begīm and Khadīja-sulṯān\r\nBegīm.[2178] I went to above Sikandarābād to wait on them.[2179]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Concerning a mortar._)\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 24th-Ṣafar 29th_) On Sunday Ustād `Alī-qulī discharged a stone\r\nfrom a large mortar; the stone went far but the mortar broke in pieces,\r\none of which, knocking down a party of men, killed eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Visit to Sīkrī._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 1st_) On Monday the 7th of the first Rabī` I rode out to visit\r\nSīkrī. The octagonal platform ordered made in the middle of the lake was\r\nready; we went over by boat, had an awning set up on it and elected for\r\n_ma'jūn_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Holy-war against Chandīrī._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 9th_) After returning from Sīkrī we started on Monday night the\r\n14th of the first Rabī`,[2180] with the intention of making Holy-war\r\nagainst Chandīrī, did as much as 3 _kurohs_ (6 m.) and dismounted in\r\nJalīsīr.[2181] After staying there two days for people to equip and\r\narray, we marched on Thursday (_Dec. 12th-Rabī` I. 17th_) and dismounted\r\nat Anwār. I left Anwār by boat, and disembarked beyond Chandwār.[2182]\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 23rd_) Advancing march by march, we dismounted at the\r\nKanār-passage[2183] on Monday the 28th.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 26th_) On Thursday the 2nd of the latter Rabī` I crossed the\r\nriver; there was 4 or 5 days delay on one bank or the other before the\r\narmy got across. On those days we went more than [Sidenote: Fol. 332.]\r\nonce on board a boat and ate _ma'jūn_. The junction of the river Chaṃbal\r\nis between one and two _kurohs_ (2-4 m.) above the Kanār-passage; on\r\nFriday I went into a boat on the Chaṃbal, passed the junction and so to\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. Troops sent against Shaikh Bāyazīd Farmūlī._)\r\n\r\nThough there had been no clear proof of Shaikh Bāyazīd's hostility, yet\r\nhis misconduct and action made it certain that he had hostile\r\nintentions. On account of this Muḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang_ was detached\r\nfrom the army and sent to bring together from Qanūj Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā\r\nand the sulṯāns and amīrs of that neighbourhood, such as Qāsim-i-ḥusain\r\nSulṯān, Bī-khūb (or, Nī-khūb) Sulṯān, Malik Qāsim, Kūkī, Abū'l-muḥammad\r\nthe lancer, and Minūchihr Khān with his elder and younger brethren and\r\nDaryā-khānīs, so that they might move against the hostile Afghāns. They\r\nwere to invite Shaikh Bāyazīd to go with them; if he came frankly, they\r\nwere to take him along; if not, were to drive him off. Muḥammad `Alī\r\nasking for a few elephants, ten were given him. After he had leave to\r\nset off, Bābā Chuhra (the Brave) was sent to and ordered to join him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. Incidents of the journey to Chandīrī._)\r\n\r\nFrom Kanār one _kuroh_ (2 m.) was done by boat.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 1st 1528 AD._) On Wednesday the 8th of the latter Rabī` we\r\ndismounted within a _kuroh_ of Kālpī. Bābā Sl. came to wait on me in\r\nthis camp; he is a son of Khalīl Sl. who is a younger brother of the\r\nfull-blood of Sl. Sa`īd Khān. Last [Sidenote: Fol. 332b.] year he fled\r\nfrom his elder brother[2184] but, repenting himself, went back from the\r\nAndar-āb border; when he neared Kāshghar, The Khān (Sa`īd) sent Ḥaidar\r\nM. to meet him and take him back.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 2nd-Rabī` II. 9th_) Next day we dismounted at `Ālam Khān's house\r\nin Kālpī where he set Hindūstānī food before us and made an offering.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 6th_) On Monday the 13th of the month we marched from Kālpī.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 10th-Rabī` II. 17th_) On Friday we dismounted at Īrij.[2185]\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 11th_) On Saturday we dismounted at Bāndīr.[2186]\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 12th_) On Sunday the 19th of the month Chīn-tīmūr Sl. was put at\r\nthe head of 6 or 7000 men and sent ahead against Chandīrī. With him went\r\nthe begs Bāqī _mīng-bāshī_ (head of a thousand), Qūj Beg's (brother)\r\nTardī Beg, `Āshiq the taster, Mullā Apāq, Muḥsin[2187] _Dūldāī_ and, of\r\nthe Hindūstānī begs, Shaikh Gūran.\r\n\r\n(_Jan 17th_) On Friday the 24th of the month we dismounted near Kachwa.\r\nAfter encouraging its people, it was bestowed on the son of\r\nBadru'd-dīn.[2188]\r\n\r\nKachwa[2189] is a shut-in place, having lowish hills all round it. A\r\ndam has been thrown across between hills on the south-east of it, and\r\nthus a large lake made, perhaps 5 or 6 _kurohs_ (10-12 m.) round. This\r\nlake encloses Kachwa on three sides; on the north-west a space of ground\r\nis kept dry;[2190] here, therefore is its Gate. On the lake are a great\r\nmany very small boats, able to hold 3 or 4 persons; in these the\r\ninhabitants go out on the lake, if they have to flee. There are two\r\nother lakes before Kachwa is [Sidenote: Fol. 333.] reached, smaller than\r\nits own and, like that, made by throwing a dam across between hills.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 18th_) We waited a day in Kachwa in order to appoint active\r\noverseers and a mass of spadesmen to level the road and cut jungle down,\r\nso that the carts and mortar[2191] might pass along it easily. Between\r\nKachwa and Chandīrī the country is jungly.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 19th-Rabī` II. 26th_) After leaving Kachwa we halted one night,\r\npassed the Burhānpūr-water (Bhurānpūr)[2192] and dismounted within 3\r\n_kurohs_ (6 m.) of Chandīrī.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Chandīrī and its capture._)\r\n\r\nThe citadel of Chandīrī stands on a hill; below it are the town\r\n(_shahr_) and outer-fort (_tāsh-qūrghān_), and below these is the level\r\nroad along which carts pass.[2193] When we left Burhānpūr (_Jan. 10th_)\r\nwe marched for a _kuroh_ below Chandīrī for the convenience of the\r\ncarts.[2194]\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 21st_) After one night's halt we dismounted beside Bahjat Khān's\r\ntank[2195] on the top of its dam, on Tuesday the 28th of the month.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 22nd-Rabī` II. 29th_) Riding out at dawn, we assigned post after\r\npost (_būljār_, _būljār_),[2196] round the walled town (_qūrghān_) to\r\ncentre, right, and left. Ustād `Alī-qulī chose, for his stone-discharge,\r\nground that had no fall[2197]; overseers and spadesmen were told off to\r\nraise a place (_m:ljār_) for the mortar to rest on, and the whole army\r\nwas ordered to get ready appliances for taking a fort, mantelets,\r\nladders[2198] and ... -mantelets (_tūra_).[2199]\r\n\r\nFormerly Chandīrī will have belonged to the Sulṯāns of Mandāū (Mandū).\r\nWhen Sl. Nāṣiru'd-dīn passed away,[2200] one [Sidenote: Fol. 333b.] of\r\nhis sons Sl. Maḥmūd who is now holding Mandū, took possession of it and\r\nits neighbouring parts, and another son called Muḥammad Shāh laid hands\r\non Chandīrī and put it under Sl. Sikandar _(Lūdī)'s_ protection, who, in\r\nhis turn, took Muḥammad Shāh's side and sent him large forces. Muḥammad\r\nShāh survived Sl. Sikandar and died in Sl. Ibrāhīm's time, leaving a\r\nvery young son called Aḥmad Shāh whom Sl. Ibrāhīm drove out and replaced\r\nby a man of his own. At the time Rānā Sangā led out an army against Sl.\r\nIbrāhīm and Ibrāhīm's begs turned against him at Dūlpūr, Chandīrī fell\r\ninto the Rānā's hands and by him was given to Medinī [Mindnī] Rāo[2201]\r\nthe greatly-trusted pagan who was now in it with 4 or 5000 other pagans.\r\n\r\nAs it was understood there was friendship between Medinī Rāo and Ārāīsh\r\nKhān, the latter was sent with Shaikh Gūran to speak to Medinī Rāo with\r\nfavour and kindness, and promise Shamsābād[2202] in exchange for\r\nChandīrī. One or two of his trusted men got out(?).[2203] No adjustment\r\nof matters was reached, it is not known whether because Medinī Rāo did\r\nnot trust what was said, or whether because he was buoyed up by delusion\r\nabout the strength of the fort.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 28th_) At dawn on Tuesday the 6th of the first Jumāda we marched\r\nfrom Bahjat Khān's tank intending to assault Chandīrī. We dismounted at\r\nthe side of the middle-tank near [Sidenote: Fol. 334.] the fort.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Bad news._)\r\n\r\nOn this same morning after reaching that ground, Khalīfa brought a\r\nletter or two of which the purport was that the troops appointed for the\r\nEast[2204] had fought without consideration, been beaten, abandoned\r\nLaknau, and gone to Qanūj. Seeing that Khalīfa was much perturbed and\r\nalarmed by these news, I said,[2205] (_Persian_) \"There is no ground for\r\nperturbation or alarm; nothing comes to pass but what is predestined of\r\nGod. As this task (Chandīrī) is ahead of us, not a breath must be drawn\r\nabout what has been told us. Tomorrow we will assault the fort; that\r\ndone, we shall see what comes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Siege of Chandīrī, resumed._)\r\n\r\nThe enemy must have strengthened just the citadel, and have posted men\r\nby twos and threes in the outer-fort for prudence' sake. That night our\r\nmen went up from all round; those few in the outer-fort did not fight;\r\nthey fled into the citadel.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 29th_) At dawn on Wednesday the 7th of the first Jumāda, we\r\nordered our men to arm, go to their posts, provoke to fight, and attack\r\neach from his place when I rode out with drum and standard.\r\n\r\nI myself, dismissing drum and standard till the fighting should grow\r\nhot, went to amuse myself by watching Ustād `Alī-qulī's\r\nstone-discharge.[2206] Nothing was effected by it because his ground had\r\nno fall (_yāghdā_) and because the fort-walls, being entirely [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 334b.] of stone, were extremely strong.\r\n\r\nThat the citadel of Chandīrī stands on a hill has been said already.\r\nDown one side of this hill runs a double-walled road (_dū-tahī_) to\r\nwater.[2207] This is the one place for attack; it had been assigned as\r\nthe post of the right and left hands and royal corps of the\r\ncentre.[2208] Hurled though assault was from every side, the greatest\r\nforce was here brought to bear. Our braves did not turn back, however\r\nmuch the pagans threw down stones and flung flaming fire upon them. At\r\nlength Shāhīm the centurion[2209] got up where the _dū-tahī_ wall\r\ntouches the wall of the outer fort; braves swarmed up in other places;\r\nthe _dū-tahī_ was taken.\r\n\r\nNot even as much as this did the pagans fight in the citadel; when a\r\nnumber of our men swarmed up, they fled in haste.[2210] In a little\r\nwhile they came out again, quite naked, and renewed the fight; they put\r\nmany of our men to flight; they made them fly (_āuchūrdīlār_) over the\r\nramparts; some they cut down and killed. Why they had gone so suddenly\r\noff the walls seems to have been that they had taken the resolve of\r\nthose who give up a place as lost; they put all their ladies and\r\nbeauties (_ṣūratīlār_) to death, then, looking themselves to die, came\r\nnaked out to fight. Our men attacking, each one from his post, drove\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 335.] them from the walls whereupon 2 or 300 of them\r\nentered Medinī Rāo's house and there almost all killed one another in\r\nthis way:—one having taken stand with a sword, the rest eagerly\r\nstretched out the neck for his blow.[2211] Thus went the greater number\r\nto hell.\r\n\r\nBy God's grace this renowned fort was captured in 2 or 3 _garīs_[2212]\r\n(_cir._ an hour), without drum and standard,[2213] with no hard fighting\r\ndone. A pillar of pagan-heads was ordered set up on a hill north-west of\r\nChandīrī. A chronogram of this victory having been found in the words\r\n_Fatḥ-i-dāru'l-ḥarb_[2214] (Conquest of a hostile seat), I thus composed\r\nthem:—\r\n\r\n   Was for awhile the station Chandīrī\r\n   Pagan-full, the seat of hostile force;\r\n   By fighting, I vanquished its fort,\r\n   The date was _Fatḥ-i-dāru'l-ḥarb_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Further description of Chandīrī._)\r\n\r\nChandīrī is situated (in) rather good country,[2215] having much\r\nrunning-water round about it. Its citadel is on a hill and inside it\r\nhas a tank cut out of the solid rock. There is another large tank[2216]\r\nat the end of the _dū-tahī_ by assaulting which the fort was taken. All\r\nhouses in Chandīrī, whether of high or low, are built of stone, those of\r\nchiefs being laboriously carved;[2217] those of the lower classes are\r\nalso of stone but are not carved. They are covered in [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n335b.] with stone-slabs instead of with earthen tiles. In front of the\r\nfort are three large tanks made by former governors who threw dams\r\nacross and made tanks round about it; their ground lies high.[2218] It\r\nhas a small river (_daryācha_), Betwa[2219] by name, which may be some 3\r\n_kurohs_ (6 m.) from Chandīrī itself; its water is noted in Hindūstān as\r\nexcellent and pleasant drinking. It is a perfect little river\r\n(_daryā-ghīna_). In its bed lie piece after piece of sloping rock\r\n(_qīālār_)[2220] fit for making houses.[2221] Chandīrī is 90 _kurohs_\r\n(180 m.) by road to the south of Āgra. In Chandīrī the altitude of the\r\nPole-star (?) is 25 degrees.[2222]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Enforced change of campaign._)\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 30th-Jumāda I. 8th_) At dawn on Thursday we went round the fort\r\nand dismounted beside Mallū Khān's tank.[2223]\r\n\r\nWe had come to Chandīrī meaning, after taking it, to move against\r\nRāīsīng, Bhīlsān, and Sārangpūr, pagan lands dependent on the pagan\r\nṢalāḥu'd-dīn, and, these taken, to move on Rānā Sangā in Chītūr. But as\r\nthat bad news had come, the begs were summoned, matters were discussed,\r\nand decision made that the proper course was first to see to the\r\nrebellion of those malignants. Chandīrī was given to the Aḥmad Shāh\r\nalready mentioned, a grandson of Sl. Nāṣiru'd-dīn; 50 _laks_ from it\r\nwere made _khalṣa_;[2224] Mullā Apāq was entrusted with its\r\nmilitary-collectorate, and left to reinforce Aḥmad Shāh with from 2 to\r\n3000 Turks and Hindūstānīs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 336.] (_Feb. 2nd_) This work finished, we marched from\r\nMallū Khān's tank on Sunday the 11th of the first Jumāda, with the\r\nintention of return (north), and dismounted on the bank of the\r\nBurhānpūr-water.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 9th_) On Sunday again, Yakka Khwāja and Ja`far Khwāja were sent\r\nfrom Bāndīr to fetch boats from Kālpī to the Kanār-passage.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 22nd_) On Saturday the 24th of the month we dismounted at the\r\nKanār-passage, and ordered the army to begin to cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. News of the rebels._)\r\n\r\nNews came in these days that the expeditionary force[2225] had abandoned\r\nQanūj also and come to Rāprī, and that a strong body of the enemy had\r\nassaulted and taken Shamsābād although Abū'l-muḥammad the lancer must\r\nhave strengthened it.[2226] There was delay of 3 or 4 days on one side\r\nor other of the river before the army got across. Once over, we moved\r\nmarch by march towards Qanūj, sending scouting braves (_qāzāq yīgītlār_)\r\nahead to get news of our opponents. Two or three marches from Qanūj,\r\nnews was brought that Ma`rūf's son had fled on seeing the dark mass of\r\nthe news-gatherers, and got away. Bīban, Bāyazīd and Ma`rūf, on hearing\r\nnews of us, crossed Gang (Ganges) and seated themselves on its eastern\r\nbank opposite Qanūj, thinking to prevent our passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. A bridge made over the Ganges._)\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 27th_) On Thursday the 6th of the latter Jumāda we passed Qanūj\r\nand dismounted on the western bank of Gang. Some of the braves went up\r\nand down the river and took boats [Sidenote: Fol. 336b.] by force,[2227]\r\nbringing in 30 or 40, large or small. Mīr Muḥammad the raftsman was sent\r\nto find a place convenient for making a bridge and to collect requisites\r\nfor making it. He came back approving of a place about a _kuroh_ (2 m.)\r\nbelow the camp. Energetic overseers were told off for the work. Ustād\r\n`Alī-qulī placed the mortar for his stone-discharge near where the\r\nbridge was to be and shewed himself active in discharging it. Muṣṯafa\r\n_Rūmī_ had the culverin-carts crossed over to an island below the place\r\nfor the bridge, and from that island began a culverin-discharge.\r\nExcellent matchlock fire was made from a post[2228] raised above the\r\nbridge. Malik Qāsim _Mughūl_ and a very few men went across the river\r\nonce or twice and fought excellently (_yakhshīlār aūrūshtīlār_). With\r\nequal boldness Bābā Sl. and Darwīsh Sl. also crossed, but went with the\r\ninsufficient number of from 10 to 15 men; they went after the Evening\r\nPrayer and came back without fighting, with nothing done; they were much\r\nblamed for this crossing of theirs. At last Malik Qāsim, grown bold,\r\nattacked the enemy's camp and, by shooting arrows into it, drew him out\r\n(?);[2229] he came with a mass of men and an elephant, fell on Malik\r\nQāsim and hurried him off. Malik Qāsim got into a boat, but before it\r\ncould put off, the elephant [Sidenote: Fol. 337.] came up and swamped\r\nit. In that encounter Malik Qāsim died.\r\n\r\nIn the days before the bridge was finished Ustād `Alī-qulī did good\r\nthings in stone-discharge (_yakhshīlār tāsh aītī_), on the first day\r\ndischarging 8 stones, on the second 16, and going on equally well for 3\r\nor 4 days. These stones he discharged from the Ghāzī-mortar which is\r\nso-called because it was used in the battle with Rānā Sangā the pagan.\r\nThere had been another and larger mortar which burst after discharging\r\none stone.[2230] The matchlockmen made a mass (_qālīn_) of discharges,\r\nbringing down many men and horses; they shot also slave-workmen running\r\nscared away (?) and men and horses passing-by.[2231]\r\n\r\n(_March 11th_) On Wednesday the 19th of the latter Jumāda the bridge\r\nbeing almost finished, we marched to its head. The Afghāns must have\r\nridiculed the bridge-making as being far from completion.[2232]\r\n\r\n(_March 12th_) The bridge being ready on Thursday, a small body of\r\nfoot-soldiers and Lāhorīs went over. Fighting as small followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. Encounter with the Afghāns._)\r\n\r\n(_March 13th_) On Friday the royal corps, and the right and left hands\r\nof the centre crossed on foot. The whole body of Afghāns, armed,\r\nmounted, and having elephants with them, attacked us. They hurried off\r\nour men of the left hand, but our centre itself (_i.e._ the royal corps)\r\nand the right hand stood [Sidenote: Fol. 337b.] firm, fought, and forced\r\nthe enemy to retire. Two men from these divisions had galloped ahead of\r\nthe rest; one was dismounted and taken; the horse of the other was\r\nstruck again and again, had had enough,[2233] turned round and when\r\namongst our men, fell down. On that day 7 or 8 heads were brought in;\r\nmany of the enemy had arrow or matchlock wounds. Fighting went on till\r\nthe Other Prayer. That night all who had gone across were made to\r\nreturn; if (more) had gone over on that Saturday's eve,[2234] most of\r\nthe enemy would probably have fallen into our hands, but this was in my\r\nmind:—Last year we marched out of Sīkrī to fight Rānā Sangā on Tuesday,\r\nNew-year's-day, and crushed that rebel on Saturday; this year we had\r\nmarched to crush these rebels on Wednesday, New-year's-day,[2235] and it\r\nwould be one of singular things, if we beat them on Sunday. So thinking,\r\nwe did not make the rest of the army cross. The enemy did not come to\r\nfight on Saturday, but stood arrayed a long way off.\r\n\r\n(_Sunday March 15th-Jumāda II. 23rd_) On this day the carts were taken\r\nover, and at this same dawn the army was ordered to cross. At beat of\r\ndrum news came from our scouts that the enemy had fled. Chīn-tīmūr Sl.\r\nwas ordered to lead his army in pursuit and the following leaders also\r\nwere made pursuers who should move with the Sulṯān and not go beyond his\r\nword:—Muḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang_, Ḥusamu'd-dīn `Alī (son) of Khalīfa,\r\nMuḥibb-i-`alī (son) of Khalīfa, Kūkī (son) of Bābā Qashqa,\r\nDost-i-muḥammad (son) of Bābā Qashqa, Bāqī of [Sidenote: Fol. 338.]\r\nTāshkīnt, and Red Walī. I crossed at the Sunnat Prayer. The camels were\r\nordered to be taken over at a passage seen lower down. That Sunday we\r\ndismounted on the bank of standing-water within a _kuroh_ of\r\nBangarmāwū.[2236] Those appointed to pursue the Afghāns were not doing\r\nit well; they had dismounted in Bangarmāwū and were scurrying off at the\r\nMid-day Prayer of this same Sunday.\r\n\r\n(_March 16th-Jumāda II. 24th_) At dawn we dismounted on the bank of a\r\nlake belonging to Bangarmāwū.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_q. Arrival of a Chaghatāī cousin._)\r\n\r\nOn this same day (_March 16th_) Tūkhtā-būghā Sl. a son of my mother's\r\nbrother (_dādā_) the Younger Khān (_Aḥmad Chaghatāī_) came and waited on\r\nme.\r\n\r\n(_March 21st_) On Saturday the 29th of the latter Jumāda I visited\r\nLaknau, crossed the Gūī-water[2237] and dismounted. This day I bathed in\r\nthe Gūī-water. Whether it was from water getting into my ear, or whether\r\nit was from the effect of the climate, is not known, but my right ear\r\nwas obstructed and for a few days there was much pain.[2238]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_r. The campaign continued._)\r\n\r\nOne or two marches from Aūd (Oudh) some-one came from Chīn-tīmūr Sl. to\r\nsay, \"The enemy is seated on the far side of the river Sīrd[a?];[2239]\r\nlet His Majesty send help.\" We detached a reinforcement of 1000 braves\r\nunder Qarācha.\r\n\r\n(_March 28th_) On Saturday the 7th of Rajab we dismounted [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 338b.] 2 or 3 _kurohs_ from Aūd above the junction of the Gagar\r\n(Gogra) and Sīrd[a]. Till today Shaikh Bāyazīd will have been on the\r\nother side of the Sīrd[a] opposite Aūd, sending letters to the Sulṯān\r\nand discussing with him, but the Sulṯān getting to know his\r\ndeceitfulness, sent word to Qarācha at the Mid-day Prayer and made ready\r\nto cross the river. On Qarācha's joining him, they crossed at once to\r\nwhere were some 50 horsemen with 3 or 4 elephants. These men could make\r\nno stand; they fled; a few having been dismounted, the heads cut off\r\nwere sent in.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Sulṯān there crossed over Bī-khūb (var. Nī-khūb) Sl. and\r\nTardī Beg (the brother) of Qūj Beg, and Bābā Chuhra (the Brave), and\r\nBāqī _shaghāwal_. Those who had crossed first and gone on, pursued\r\nShaikh Bāyazīd till the Evening Prayer, but he flung himself into the\r\njungle and escaped. Chīn-tīmūr dismounted late on the bank of\r\nstanding-water, rode on at midnight after the rebel, went as much as 40\r\n_kurohs_ (80 m.), and came to where Shaikh Bāyazīd's family and\r\nrelations (_nisba_?) had been; they however must have fled. He sent\r\ngallopers off in all directions from that place; Bāqī _shaghāwal_ and a\r\nfew braves drove the enemy like sheep before them, overtook the family\r\nand brought in some Afghān prisoners.\r\n\r\nWe stayed a few days on that ground (near Aūd) in order to settle the\r\naffairs of Aūd. People praised the land lying along the Sīrd[a] 7 or 8\r\n_kurohs_ (14-16 m.) above Aūd, saying it was hunting-ground. Mīr\r\nMuḥammad the raftsman was sent out and returned after looking at the\r\ncrossings over the Gagar-water (Gogra) and the Sīrd[a]-water (Chauka?).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 339.] (_April 2nd_) On Thursday the 12th of the month I\r\nrode out intending to hunt.[2240]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S NOTE.\r\n\r\nHere, in all known texts of the _Bābur-nāma_ there is a break of the\r\nnarrative between April 2nd and Sep. 18th 1528 AD.-Jumāda II. 12th 934\r\nAH. and Muḥarram 3rd 935 AH., which, whether intentional or accidental,\r\nis unexplained by Bābur's personal circumstances. It is likely to be due\r\nto a loss of pages from Bābur's autograph manuscript, happening at some\r\ntime preceding the making of either of the Persian translations of his\r\nwritings and of the Elphinstone and Ḥaidarābād transcripts. Though such\r\na loss might have occurred easily during the storm chronicled on f.\r\n376_b_, it seems likely that Bābur would then have become aware of it\r\nand have made it good. A more probable explanation of the loss is the\r\ndanger run by Humāyūn's library during his exile from rule in Hindūstān,\r\nat which same time may well have occurred the seeming loss of the record\r\nof 936 and 937 AH.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Transactions of the period of the lacuna._)\r\n\r\nMr. Erskine notes (_Mems._ p. 381 n.) that he found the gap in all MSS.\r\nhe saw and that historians of Hindūstān throw no light upon the\r\ntransactions of the period. Much can be gleaned however as to Bābur's\r\noccupations during the 5-1/2 months of the _lacuna_ from his chronicle\r\nof 935 AH. which makes several references to occurrences of \"last year\"\r\nand also allows several inferences to be drawn. From this source it\r\nbecomes known that the Afghān campaign the record of which is broken by\r\nthe gap, was carried on and that in its course Bābur was at Jūn-pūr (f.\r\n365), Chausa (f. 365_b_) and Baksara (f. 366-366_b_); that he swam the\r\nGanges (f. 366_b_), bestowed Sarūn on a Farmūlī Shaikh-zāda (f. 374_b_\r\nand f. 377), negociated with Rānā Sangā's son Bikramājīt (f. 342_b_),\r\nordered a Chār-bāgh laid out (f. 340), and was ill for 40 days (f.\r\n346_b_). It may be inferred too that he visited Dūlpūr (f. 353_b_)\r\nrecalled `Askarī (f. 339), sent Khwāja Dost-i-khāwand on family affairs\r\nto Kābul (f. 345_b_), and was much pre-occupied by the disturbed state\r\nof Kābul (_see_ his letters to Humāyūn and Khwāja Kālan written in 935\r\nAH.).[2241]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to follow the dates of events in 935 AH. because in many\r\ninstances only the day of the week or a \"next day\" is entered. I am far\r\nfrom sure that one passage at least now found _s.a._ 935 AH. does not\r\nbelong to 934 AH. It is not in the Ḥai. Codex (where its place would\r\nhave been on f. 363_b_), and, so far as I can see, does not fit with the\r\ndates of 935 AH. It will be considered with least trouble with its\r\ncontext and my notes (_q.v._ f. 363_b_ and ff. 366-366_b_).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Remarks on the lacuna._)\r\n\r\nOne interesting biographical topic is likely to have found mention in\r\nthe missing record, _viz._ the family difficulties which led to\r\n`Askarī's supersession by Kāmrān in the government of Multān (f. 359).\r\n\r\nAnother is the light an account of the second illness of 934 AH. might\r\nhave thrown on a considerable part of the Collection of verses already\r\nwritten in Hindūstān and now known to us as the _Rāmpūr Dīwān_. The\r\n_Bābur-nāma_ allows the dates of much of its contents to be known, but\r\nthere remain poems which seem prompted by the self-examination of some\r\nillness not found in the _B.N._ It contains the metrical version of\r\nKhwāja `Ubaidu'l-lāh's _Wālidiyyah_ of which Bābur writes on f. 346 and\r\nit is dated Monday Rabī` II. 15th 935 AH. (Dec. 29th 1528 AD.). I\r\nsurmise that the reflective verses following the _Wālidiyyah_ belong to\r\nthe 40 days' illness of 934 AH. _i.e._ were composed in the period of\r\nthe _lacuna_. The Collection, as it is in the \"Rāmpūr Dīwān\", went to a\r\nfriend who was probably Khwāja Kalān; it may have been the only such\r\ncollection made by Bābur. No other copy of it has so far been found. It\r\nhas the character of an individual gift with verses specially addressed\r\nto its recipient. Any light upon it which may have vanished with pages\r\nof 934 AH. is an appreciable loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n935 AH.-SEP. 15TH 1528 TO SEP. 5TH 1529 AD.[2242]\r\n\r\n(_a. Arrivals at Court._)\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 18th_) On Friday the 3rd[2243] of Muḥarram, `Askarī whom I had\r\nsummoned for the good of Multān[2244] before I moved out for Chandīrī,\r\nwaited on me in the private-house.[2245]\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 19th_) Next day waited on me the historian Khwānd-amīr, Maulānā\r\nShihāb[2246] the enigmatist, and Mīr Ibrāhīm the harper a relation of\r\nYūnas-i-`alī, who had all come out of Herī long before, wishing to wait\r\non me.[2247]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b. Bābur starts for Gūālīār._)[2248]\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 20th_) With the intention of visiting Gūālīār which in books they\r\nwrite Gālīūr,[2249] I crossed the Jūn at the Other Prayer of Sunday the\r\n5th of the month, went into the fort of Āgra to bid farewell to\r\nFakhr-i-jahān Begīm and Khadīja-sulṯān Begīm who were to start for Kābul\r\nin a few days, and got to horse. Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā asked for leave\r\nand stayed behind in Āgra. That night we did 3 or 4 _kurohs_ (6-8 m.) of\r\nthe road, dismounted near a large lake (_kūl_) and there slept.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 21st_) We got through the Prayer somewhat before time\r\n(_Muḥ. 6th_) and rode on, nooned[2250] on the bank of the\r\nGamb[h]īr-water[2251], and went on shortly after the Mid-day Prayer. On\r\nthe way we ate[2252] powders mixed with the flour of parched [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 339b.] grain,[2253] Mullā Rafī` having prepared them for raising\r\nthe spirits. They were found very distasteful and unsavoury. Near the\r\nOther Prayer we dismounted a _kuroh_ (2 m.) west of Dūlpūr, at a place\r\nwhere a garden and house had been ordered made.[2254]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c. Work in Dūlpūr (Dhūlpūr)._)\r\n\r\nThat place is at the end of a beaked hill,[2255] its beak being of solid\r\nred building-stone (_`imārat-tāsh_). I had ordered the (beak of the)\r\nhill cut down (dressed down?) to the ground-level and that if there\r\nremained a sufficient height, a house was to be cut out in it, if not,\r\nit was to be levelled and a tank (_ḥauẓ_) cut out in its top. As it was\r\nnot found high enough for a house, Ūstād Shāh Muḥammad the stone-cutter\r\nwas ordered to level it and cut out an octagonal, roofed tank. North of\r\nthis tank the ground is thick with trees, mangoes, _jāman_ (_Eugenia\r\njambolana_), all sorts of trees; amongst them I had ordered a well made,\r\n10 by 10; it was almost ready; its water goes to the afore-named tank.\r\nTo the north of this tank Sl. Sikandar's dam is flung across (the\r\nvalley); on it houses have been built, and above it the waters of the\r\nRains gather into a great lake. On the east of this lake is a garden; I\r\nordered a seat and four-pillared platform (_tālār_) to be cut out in\r\nthe solid rock on that same side, and a mosque [Sidenote: Fol. 340.]\r\nbuilt on the western one.\r\n\r\n(_Sept. 22nd and 23rd—Muḥ. 7th and 8th_) On account of these various\r\nworks, we stayed in Dūlpūr on Tuesday and Wednesday.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d. Journey to Gūālīār resumed._)\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 24th_) On Thursday we rode on, crossed the Chaṃbal-river and made\r\nthe Mid-day Prayer on its bank, between the two Prayers (the Mid-day and\r\nthe Afternoon) bestirred ourselves to leave that place, passed the\r\nKawārī and dismounted. The Kawārī-water being high through rain, we\r\ncrossed it by boat, making the horses swim over.\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 25th_) Next day, Friday which was 'Āshūr (_Muḥ. 10th_), we rode\r\non, took our nooning at a village on the road, and at the Bed-time\r\nPrayer dismounted a _kuroh_ north of Gūālīār, in a Chār-bāgh ordered\r\nmade last year.[2256]\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 26th_) Riding on next day after the Mid-day Prayer, we visited\r\nthe low hills to the north of Gūālīār, and the Praying-place, went into\r\nthe fort[2257] through the Gate called Hātī-pūl which joins Mān-sing's\r\nbuildings (_`imārāt_[2258]), and dismounted, close to the Other Prayer,\r\nat those (_`imāratlār_)[2259] of Rāja Bikramājīt in which\r\nRaḥīm-dād[2260] had settled himself.\r\n\r\nTo-night I elected to take opium because of ear-ache; another reason was\r\nthe shining of the moon.[2261]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e. Visit to the Rājas' palaces._)\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 27th_) Opium sickness gave me much discomfort next day (_Muḥ.\r\n12th_); I vomited a good deal. Sickness notwithstanding, I visited the\r\nbuildings (_`imāratlār_) of Mān-sing and [Sidenote: Fol. 340b.]\r\nBikramājīt thoroughly. They are wonderful buildings, entirely of hewn\r\nstone, in heavy and unsymmetrical blocks however.[2262] Of all the\r\nRājas' buildings Mān-sing's is the best and loftiest.[2263] It is more\r\nelaborately worked on its eastern face than on the others. This face may\r\nbe 40 to 50 _qārī_ (yards) high,[2264] and is entirely of hewn stone,\r\nwhitened with plaster.[2265] In parts it is four storeys high; the lower\r\ntwo are very dark; we went through them with candles.[2266] On one (or,\r\nevery) side of this building are five cupolas[2267] having between each\r\ntwo of them a smaller one, square after the fashion of Hindūstān. On the\r\nlarger ones are fastened sheets of gilded copper. On the outside of the\r\nwalls is painted-tile work, the semblance of plantain-trees being shewn\r\nall round with green tiles. In a bastion of the eastern front is the\r\nHātī-pūl,[2268] _hātī_ being what these people call an elephant, _pūl_,\r\na gate. A sculptured image of an elephant with two drivers\r\n(_fīl-bān_)[2269] stands at the out-going (_chīqīsh_) of this Gate; it\r\nis exactly like an elephant; from it the gate is called Hātī-pūl. A\r\nwindow in the [Sidenote: Fol. 341.] lowest storey where the building has\r\nfour, looks towards this elephant and gives a near view of it.[2270] The\r\ncupolas which have been mentioned above are themselves the topmost stage\r\n(_murtaba_) of the building;[2271] the sitting-rooms are on the second\r\nstorey (_ṯabaqat_), in a hollow even;[2272] they are rather airless\r\nplaces although Hindūstānī pains have been taken with them.[2273] The\r\nbuildings of Mān-sing's son Bikramājīt are in a central position (_aūrta\r\ndā_) on the north side of the fort.[2274] The son's buildings do not\r\nmatch the father's. He has made a great dome, very dark but growing\r\nlighter if one stays awhile in it.[2275] Under it is a smaller building\r\ninto which no light comes from any side. When Raḥīm-dād settled down in\r\nBikramājīt's buildings, he made a rather small hall [_kīchīkrāq\r\ntālārghīna_] on the top of this dome.[2276] From Bikramājīt's buildings\r\na road has been made to his father's, a road such that nothing is seen\r\nof it from outside and nothing known of it inside, a quite enclosed\r\nroad.[2277]\r\n\r\nAfter visiting these buildings, we rode to a college Raḥīm-dād\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 341b.] had made by the side of a large tank, there\r\nenjoyed a flower-garden[2278] he had laid out, and went late to where\r\nthe camp was in the Chārbāgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f. Raḥīm-dād's flower-garden._)\r\n\r\nRaḥīm-dād has planted a great numbers of flowers in his garden\r\n(_bāghcha_), many being beautiful red oleanders. In these places the\r\noleander-flower is peach,[2279] those of Gūālīār are beautiful, deep\r\nred. I took some of them to Āgra and had them planted in gardens there.\r\nOn the south of the garden is a large lake[2280] where the waters of the\r\nRains gather; on the west of it is a lofty idol-house,[2281] side by\r\nside with which Sl. Shihābu'd-dīn Aīltmīsh (Altamsh) made a Friday\r\nmosque; this is a very lofty building (_`imārat_), the highest in the\r\nfort; it is seen, with the fort, from the Dūlpūr-hill (_cir._ 30 m.\r\naway). People say the stone for it was cut out and brought from the\r\nlarge lake above-mentioned. Raḥīm-dād has made a wooden (_yīghāch_)\r\n_tālār_ in his garden, and porches at the gates, which, after the\r\nHindūstānī fashion, are somewhat low and shapeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g. The Urwāh-valley._)\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 28th_) Next day (_Muḥ. 13th_) at the Mid-day Prayer we rode out\r\nto visit places in Gūālīār we had not yet seen. We saw the _`imārat_\r\ncalled Bādalgar[2282] which is part of Mān-sing's fort (_qila`_), went\r\nthrough the Hātī-pūl and across the fort to a place called Urwā (Urwāh),\r\nwhich is a valley-bottom (_qūl_) on its western side. Though Urwā is\r\noutside the fort-wall running along the top of the hill, it has two\r\nstages (_murtaba_) of high wall at its mouth. The higher of these walls\r\nis some 30 or 40 _qārī_ (yards) high; this is the longer one; at each\r\nend it joins [Sidenote: Fol. 342.] the wall of the fort. The second wall\r\ncurves in and joins the middle part of the first; it is the lower and\r\nshorter of the two. This curve of wall will have been made for a\r\nwater-thief;[2283] within it is a stepped well (_wā'īn_) in which water\r\nis reached by 10 or 15 steps. Above the Gate leading from the valley to\r\nthis walled-well the name of Sl. Shihābu'd-dīn Aīltmīsh (Altamsh) is\r\ninscribed, with the date 630 (AH.-1233 AD.). Below this outer wall and\r\noutside the fort there is a large lake which seems to dwindle (at times)\r\ntill no lake remains; from it water goes to the water-thief. There are\r\ntwo other lakes inside Urwā the water of which those who live in the\r\nfort prefer to all other.\r\n\r\nThree sides of Urwā are solid rock, not the red rock of Bīāna but one\r\npaler in colour. On these sides people have cut out idol-statues, large\r\nand small, one large statue on the south side being perhaps 20 _qārī_\r\n(yds.) high.[2284] These idols are shewn quite naked without covering\r\nfor the privities. Along the sides of [Sidenote: Fol. 342b.] the two\r\nUrwā lakes 20 or 30 wells have been dug, with water from which useful\r\nvegetables (_sabzī kārlīklār_), flowers and trees are grown. Urwā is not\r\na bad place; it is shut in (T. _tūr_); the idols are its defect; I, for\r\nmy part, ordered them destroyed.[2285]\r\n\r\nGoing out of Urwā into the fort again, we enjoyed the window[2286] of\r\nthe Sultānī-pūl which must have been closed through the pagan time till\r\nnow, went to Raḥīm-dād's flower-garden at the Evening Prayer, there\r\ndismounted and there slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h. A son of Rānā Sangā negociates with Bābur._)\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 29th_) On Tuesday the 14th of the month came people from Rānā\r\nSangā's second son, Bikramājīt by name, who with his mother Padmāwatī\r\nwas in the fort of Rantanbūr. Before I rode out for Gūālīār,[2287]\r\nothers had come from his great and trusted Hindū, Asūk by name, to\r\nindicate Bikramājīt's submission and obeisance and ask a\r\nsubsistence-allowance of 70 _laks_ for him; it had been settled at that\r\ntime that _parganas_ to the amount he asked should be bestowed on him,\r\nhis men were given leave to go, with tryst for Gūālīār which we were\r\nabout to visit. They came into Gūālīār somewhat after the trysting-day.\r\nThe Hindū Asūk[2288] is said to be a near relation of Bikramājīt's\r\nmother Padmāwatī; he, for his part, set these particulars forth\r\nfather-like [Sidenote: Fol. 343.] and son-like;[2289] they, for theirs,\r\nconcurring with him, agreed to wish me well and serve me. At the time\r\nwhen Sl. Maḥmūd (_Khīljī_) was beaten by Rānā Sangā and fell into pagan\r\ncaptivity (925 AH.-1519 AD.) he possessed a famous crown-cap\r\n(_tāj-kula_) and golden belt, accepting which Sangā let him go free.\r\nThat crown-cap and golden belt must have become Bikramājīt's; his elder\r\nbrother Ratan-sī, now Rānā of Chītūr in his father's place, had asked\r\nfor them but Bikramājīt had not given them up,[2290] and now made the\r\nmen he sent to me, speak to me about them, and ask for Bīāna in place of\r\nRantanbūr. We led them away from the Bīāna question and promised\r\nShamsābād in exchange for Rantanbūr. To-day (_Muḥ. 14th_) they were\r\ngiven a nine days' tryst for Bīāna, were dressed in robes of honour, and\r\nallowed to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i. Hindū temples visited._)\r\n\r\nWe rode from the flower-garden to visit the idol-houses of Gūālīār. Some\r\nare two, and some are three storeys high, each storey rather low, in the\r\nancient fashion. On their stone plinths (_izāra_) are sculptured images.\r\nSome idol-houses, College-fashion, have a portico, large high\r\ncupolas[2291] and _madrāsa_-like cells, each topped by a slender stone\r\ncupola.[2292] In the lower cells are idols carved in the rock.\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 343b.]\r\n\r\nAfter enjoying the sight of these buildings (_`imāratlār_) we left the\r\nfort by the south Gate,[2293] made an excursion to the south, and went\r\n(north) to the Chār-bāgh Raḥim-dād had made over-against the\r\nHātī-pūl.[2294] He had prepared a feast of cooked-meat (_āsh_) for us\r\nand, after setting excellent food before us, made offering of a mass of\r\ngoods and coin worth 4 _laks._ From his Chār-bāgh I rode to my own.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j. Excursion to a waterfall._)\r\n\r\n(_Sep. 30th._) On Wednesday the 15th of the month I went to see a\r\nwaterfall 6 _kurohs_ (12 m.) to the south-east of Gūālīār. Less than\r\nthat must have been ridden;[2295] close to the Mid-day Prayer we reached\r\na fall where sufficient water for one mill was coming down a slope\r\n(_qīā_) an _arghamchī_[2296] high. Below the fall there is a large lake;\r\nabove it the water comes flowing through solid rock; there is solid rock\r\nalso below the fall. A lake forms wherever the water falls. On the banks\r\nof the water lie piece after piece of rock as if for seats, but the\r\nwater is said not always to be there. We sat down above the fall and ate\r\n_ma`jūn_, went up-stream to visit its source (_badayat_), returned, got\r\nout on higher ground, and stayed while musicians played and reciters\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 344.] repeated things (_nīma aītīlār_). The Ebony-tree\r\nwhich Hindīs call _tindū_, was pointed out to those who had not seen it\r\nbefore. We went down the hill and, between the Evening and Bed-time\r\nPrayers, rode away, slept at a place reached near the second watch\r\n(midnight), and with the on-coming of the first watch of day (6 a.m.\r\n_Muḥ. 16th-Oct. 1st_) reached the Chār-bāgh and dismounted.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k. Ṣalāḥu'd-dīn's birth-place._)[2297]\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 2nd_) On Friday the 17th of the month, I visited the garden of\r\nlemons and pumeloes (_sadā-fal_) in a valley-bottom amongst the hills\r\nabove a village called Sūkhjana (?)[2298] which is Ṣalāḥu'd-dīn's\r\nbirth-place. Returning to the Chār-bāgh, I dismounted there in the first\r\nwatch.[2299]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l. Incidents of the march from Gūālīār._)\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 4th_) On Sunday the 19th of the month, we rode before dawn from\r\nthe Chār-bāgh, crossed the Kawārī-water and took our nooning\r\n(_tūshlāndūk_). After the Mid-day Prayer we rode on, at sunset passed\r\nthe Chaṃbal-water, between the Evening and Bed-time Prayers entered\r\nDulpūr-fort, there, by lamp-light, visited a Hot-bath which Abū'l-fatḥ\r\nhad made, rode on, and dismounted at the dam-head where the new\r\nChār-bāgh is in making.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 5th_) Having stayed the night there, at dawn (_Monday 20th_) I\r\nvisited what places had been ordered made.[2300] The face (_yūz_) of the\r\nroofed-tank, ordered cut in the solid rock, was not being got up quite\r\nstraight; more stone-cutters were sent for who were to make the\r\ntank-bottom level, pour in water, and, by help of the water, to get the\r\nsides to one height. They got the face up straight just before the Other\r\nPrayer, were then ordered to fill the tank with water, by help of the\r\nwater made the sides [Sidenote: Fol. 344b.] match, then busied\r\nthemselves to smooth them. I ordered a water-chamber (_āb-khāna_) made\r\nat a place where it would be cut in the solid rock; inside it was to be\r\na small tank also cut in the solid rock.\r\n\r\n   (_Here the record of 6 days is wanting._)[2301]\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 12th_?) To-day, Monday (_27th_?), there was a _ma`jūn_ party.\r\n(_Oct. 13th_) On Tuesday I was still in that same place. (_Oct. 14th_)\r\nOn the night of Wednesday,[2302] after opening the mouth and eating\r\nsomething[2303] we rode for Sīkrī. Near the second watch (midnight), we\r\ndismounted somewhere and slept; I myself could not sleep on account of\r\npain in my ear, whether caused by cold, as is likely, I do not know. At\r\nthe top of the dawn, we bestirred ourselves from that place, and in the\r\nfirst watch dismounted at the garden now in making at Sīkrī. The\r\ngarden-wall and well-buildings were not getting on to my satisfaction;\r\nthe overseers therefore were threatened and punished. We rode on from\r\nSīkrī between the Other and Evening Prayers, passed through Marhākūr,\r\ndismounted somewhere and slept.\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 15th_) Riding on (_Thursday 30th_), we got into Āgra during the\r\nfirst watch (6-9 a.m.). In the fort I saw the honoured Khadīja-sulṯān\r\nBegīm who had stayed behind for several reasons when Fakhr-i-jahān Begīm\r\nstarted for Kābul. Crossing Jūn (Jumna), I went to the Garden-of-eight\r\nparadises.[2304]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m. Arrival of kinswomen._)\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 17th_) On Saturday the 3rd of Ṣafar, between the Other and\r\nEvening Prayers, I went to see three of the great-aunt begīms,[2305]\r\nGauhar-shād Begīm, Badī`u'l-jamāl Begīm, and Āq Begīm, with also, of\r\nlesser begīms,[2306] Sl. Maṣ`ūd Mīrzā's daughter Khān-zāda Begīm, and\r\nSulṯān-bakht Begīm's daughter, and my _yīnkā chīcha's_ grand-daughter,\r\nthat is to say, Zaināb-sulṯān Begīm.[2307] They had come past Tūta and\r\ndismounted at a small [Sidenote: Fol. 345.] standing-water (_qarā sū_)\r\non the edge of the suburbs. I came back direct by boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n. Despatch of an envoy to receive charge of Ranthaṃbhor._)\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 19th_) On Monday the 5th of the month of Ṣafar, Hāmūsī son of\r\nDīwa, an old Hindū servant from Bhīra, was joined with Bikramājīt's\r\nformer[2308] and later envoys in order that pact and agreement for the\r\nsurrender of Ranthanbūr and for the conditions of Bikramājīt's service\r\nmight be made in their own (hindū) way and custom. Before our man\r\nreturned, he was to see, and learn, and make sure of matters; this done,\r\nif that person (_i.e._ Bikramājīt) stood fast to his spoken word, I,\r\nfor my part, promised that, God bringing it aright, I would set him in\r\nhis father's place as Rānā of Chitūr.[2309]\r\n\r\n   (_Here the record of 3 days is wanting._)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_o. A levy on stipendiaries._)\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 22nd_) By this time the treasure of Iskandar and Ibrāhīm in Dihlī\r\nand Āgra was at an end. Royal orders were given therefore, on Thursday\r\nthe 8th of Ṣafar, that each stipendiary (_wajhdār_) should drop into the\r\nDīwān, 30 in every 100 of his allowance, to be used for war-material and\r\nappliances, for equipment, for powder, and for the pay of gunners and\r\nmatchlockmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_p. Royal letters sent into Khurāsān._)\r\n\r\n(_Oct. 24th_) On Saturday the 10th of the month, Pay-master Sl.\r\nMuḥammad's foot-man Shāh Qāsim who once before had taken letters of\r\nencouragement to kinsfolk in Khurāsān,[2310] was sent to Herī with other\r\nletters to the purport that, through God's grace, our hearts were at\r\nease in Hindūstān about the rebels and [Sidenote: Fol. 345b.] pagans of\r\neast and west; and that, God bringing it aright, we should use every\r\nmeans and assuredly in the coming spring should touch the goal of our\r\ndesire.[2311] On the margin of a royal letter sent to Ahmad _Afshār_\r\n(_Turk_) a summons to Farīdūn the _qabūz_-player was written with my own\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n   (_Here the record of 11 days is wanting._)\r\n\r\nIn today's forenoon (_Tuesday 20th_?) I made a beginning of eating\r\nquicksilver.[2312]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_q. News from Kābul and Khurāsān._)[2313]\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 4th_) On Wednesday the 21st of the month (_Ṣafar_) a Hindūstānī\r\nfoot-man (_pīāda_) brought dutiful letters (_`arẓ-dāshtlār_) from Kāmrān\r\nand Khwāja Dost-i-khāwand. The Khwāja had reached Kābul on the 10th of\r\nẔū'l-ḥijja[2314] and will have been anxious to go on[2315] to Humāyūn's\r\npresence, but there comes to him a man from Kāmrān, saying, \"Let the\r\nhonoured Khwāja come (to see me); let him deliver whatever royal orders\r\nthere may be; let him go on to Humāyūn when matters have been talked\r\nover.\"[2316] Kāmrān will have gone into Kābul on the 17th of Ẕū'l-ḥijja\r\n(_Sep. 2nd_), will have talked with the Khwāja and, on the 28th of the\r\nsame month, will have let him go on for Fort Victory (_Qila'-i-ẕafar_).\r\n\r\nThere was this excellent news in the dutiful letters received:—that\r\nShāh-zāda T̤ahmāsp, resolute to put down the Aūzbeg,[2317] had overcome\r\nand killed Rīnīsh (var. Zīnīsh) _Aūzbeg_ in Dāmghān and made a general\r\nmassacre of his people; that 'Ubaid Khān, getting sure news about the\r\n_Qīzīl-bāsh_ (Red-head) had risen from round Herī, gone to Merv, called\r\nup to him there all the sulṯāns of Samarkand and those parts, and that\r\nall the sulṯāns of Mā warā'u'n-nahr had gone to help him.[2318]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 346.] This same foot-man brought the further news that\r\nHumāyūn was said to have had a son by the daughter of Yādgār T̤aghāī,\r\nand that Kāmrān was said to be marrying in Kābul, taking the daughter\r\nof his mother's brother Sl. `Alī Mīrzā (_Begchīk_).[2319]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_r. Honours for an artificer._)[2320]\r\n\r\nOn this same day Sayyid Daknī of Shīrāz the diviner (_ghaiba-gar_?) was\r\nmade to wear a dress of honour, given presents, and ordered to finish\r\nthe arched(?) well (_khwāralīq-chāh_) as he best knew how.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_s. The Wālidiyyah-risāla (Parental-tract)._)\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 6th_) On Friday the 23rd of the month[2321] such heat[2322]\r\nappeared in my body that with difficulty I got through the\r\nCongregational Prayer in the Mosque, and with much trouble through the\r\nMid-day Prayer, in the book-room, after due time, and little by little.\r\nThereafter[2323] having had fever, I trembled less on Sunday (_Nov.\r\n28th_). During the night of Tuesday[2324] the 27th of the month Ṣafar,\r\nit occurred to me to versify (_naẕm qīlmāq_)\r\n\r\nthe _Wālidiyyah-risāla_ of his Reverence Khwāja 'Ubaidu'l-lāh.[2325] I\r\nlaid it to heart that if I, going to the soul of his Reverence[2326] for\r\nprotection, were freed from this disease, it would be a sign that my\r\npoem was accepted, just as the author of the _Qaṣīdatu'l-būrda_[2327]\r\nwas freed from the affliction of paralysis when his poem [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n346b.] had been accepted. To this end I began to versify the tract,\r\nusing the metre[2328] of Maulānā 'Abdu´r-raḥīm _Jāmī's Subḥatu'l-abrār_\r\n(Rosary of the Righteous). Thirteen couplets were made in that same\r\nnight. I tasked myself not to make fewer than 10 a day; in the end one\r\nday had been omitted. While last year every time such illness had\r\nhappened, it had persisted at least a month or 40 days,[2329] this year,\r\nby God's grace and his Reverence's favour, I was free, except for a\r\nlittle depression (_afsurda_), on Thursday the 29th of the month (_Nov.\r\n12th_). The end of versifying the contents of the tract was reached on\r\nSaturday the 8th of the first Rabī' (_Nov. 20th_). One day 52 couplets\r\nhad been made.[2330]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_t. Troops warned for service._)\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 11th_) On Wednesday the 28th of the month royal orders were sent\r\non all sides for the armies, saying, \"God bringing it about, at an\r\nearly opportunity my army will be got to horse. Let all come soon,\r\nequipped for service.\"\r\n\r\n   (_Here the record of 9 days is wanting._)[2331]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_u. Messengers from Humāyūn._)\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 21st_) On Sunday the 9th of the first Rabī`, Beg Muḥammad\r\n_ta`alluqchī_[2332] came, who had been sent last year (934 AH.) at the\r\nend of Muḥarram to take a dress of honour and a horse to Humāyūn.[2333]\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 22nd_) On Monday the 10th of the month there came from Humāyūn's\r\npresence Wais _Lāgharī's_ (son) Beg-gīna (Little Beg) and Bīān Shaikh,\r\none of Humāyūn's servants who had come as the messenger of the good\r\ntidings of the birth of Humāyūn's son whose name he gave as Al-amān.\r\nShaikh Abū'l-wajd found _Shăh sa`ādatmand_[2334] to be the date of his\r\nbirth. [Sidenote: Fol. 347.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_v. Rapid travel._)\r\n\r\nBīān Shaikh set out long after Beg-gīna. He parted from Humāyūn on\r\nFriday the 9th of Ṣafar (_Oct. 23rd_) at a place below Kishm called\r\nDū-shaṃba (Monday); he came into Āgra on Monday the 10th of the first\r\nRabī` (_Nov. 23rd_). He came very quickly! Another time he actually came\r\nfrom Qila`-i-ẕafar to Qandahār in 11 days.[2335]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_w. News of T̤ahmāsp's victory over the Aūzbegs._)\r\n\r\nBīān Shaikh brought news about Shāh-zāda T̤ahmāsp's advancing\r\nout of `Irāq and defeating the Aūzbeg.[2336] Here are his\r\nparticulars:—Shāh-zāda T̤ahmāsp, having come out of `Irāq with 40,000\r\nmen arrayed in Rūmī fashion of matchlock and cart,[2337] advances with\r\ngreat speed, takes Basṯām, slaughters Rīnīsh (var. Zīnīsh) _Aūzbeg_ and\r\nhis men in Dāmghān, and from there passes right swiftly on.[2338] Kīpīk\r\nBī's son Qaṃbar-i-`alī Beg is beaten by one of the _Qīzīl-bāsh_\r\n(Red-head)'s men, and with his few followers goes to `Ubaid Khān's\r\npresence. `Ubaid Khān finds it undesirable to stay near Herī, hurriedly\r\nsends off gallopers to all the sulṯāns of Balkh, Ḥiṣār, Samarkand, and\r\nTāshkend (Tāshkīnt) and goes himself to Merv. Sīūnjak Sl.'s younger son\r\nBārāq Sl. from Tāshkend, Kūchūm Khān, with (his sons) Abū-sa`īd Sl. and\r\nPūlad Sl., and Jānī Beg Sl. with his sons, from [Sidenote: Fol. 347b.]\r\nSamarkand and Mīān-kāl, Mahdī Sl.'s and Ḥamza Sl.'s sons from Ḥiṣār,\r\nKītīn-qarā Sl. from Balkh, all these sulṯāns assemble right swiftly in\r\nMerv. To them their informers (_tīl-chī_) take news that Shāh-zāda,\r\nafter saying, \"`Ubaid Khān is seated near Herī with few men only,\" had\r\nbeen advancing swiftly with his 40,000 men, but that when he heard of\r\nthis assembly (_i.e._ in Merv), he made a ditch in the meadow of\r\nRādagān[2339] and seated himself there.[2340] Here-upon the Aūzbegs,\r\nwith entire disregard of their opponents,[2341] left their counsels at\r\nthis:—\"Let all of us sulṯāns and khāns seat ourselves in Mashhad;[2342]\r\nlet a few of us be told off with 20,000 men to go close to the\r\nQīzīl-bāsh camp[2343] and not let them put head out; let us order\r\nmagicians[2344] to work their magic directly Scorpio appears;[2345] by\r\nthis stratagem the enemy will be enfeebled, and we shall overcome.\" So\r\nsaid, they march from Merv. Shāh-zāda gets out of Mashhad.[2346] He\r\nconfronts them near Jām-and-Khirgird.[2347] There defeat befalls the\r\nAūzbeg side.[2348] A mass of sulṯāns are overcome and slaughtered.\r\n\r\nIn one letter it (_khūd_) was written, \"It is not known for certain\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 348.] that any sulṯān except Kūchūm Khān has escaped;\r\nnot a man who went with the army has come back up to now.\" The sulṯāns\r\nwho were in Ḥiṣār abandoned it. Ibrāhīm _Jānī's_ son Chalma, whose real\r\nname is Ismā`īl, must be in the fort.[2349]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_x. Letters written by Bābur._)\r\n\r\n(_Nov. 27th and 28th_) This same Bīān Shaikh was sent quite quickly back\r\nwith letters. for Humāyūn and Kāmrān. These and other writings being\r\nready by Friday the 14th of the month (_Nov. 27th_) were entrusted to\r\nhim, his leave was given, and on Saturday the 15th he got well out of\r\nĀgra.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPY OF A LETTER TO HUMĀYŪN.[2350]\r\n\r\n\"The first matter, after saying, 'Salutation' to Humāyūn whom I am\r\nlonging to see, is this:—\r\n\r\n\"Exact particulars of the state of affairs on that side and on this[2351]\r\nhave been made known by the letters and dutiful representations brought\r\non Monday the 10th of the first Rabī` by Beg-gīna and Bīān Shaikh.\r\n\r\n   (_Turkī_) Thank God! a son is born to thee!\r\n             A son to thee, to me a heart-enslaver (_dil-bandī_).\r\n\r\n\"May the Most High ever allot to thee and to me tidings as joyful! So may\r\nit be, O Lord of the two worlds!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou sayest thou hast called him Al-amān; God bless and prosper this!\r\nThou writest it so thyself (_i.e._ Al-amān), but hast over-looked that\r\ncommon people mostly say _alāmā_ or _aīlāmān_.[2352] [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n348b.] Besides that, this _Al_ is rare in names.[2353] May God bless and\r\nprosper him in name and person; may He grant us to keep Al-amān (peace)\r\nfor many years and many decades of years![2354] May He now order our\r\naffairs by His own mercy and favour; not in many decades comes such a\r\nchance as this!\"[2355]\r\n\r\n\"Again:—On Tuesday the 11th of the month (_Nov. 23rd_) came the false\r\nrumour that the Balkhīs had invited and were fetching Qurbān[2356] into\r\nBalkh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again:—Kāmrān and the Kābul begs have orders to join thee; this done,\r\nmove on Ḥiṣār, Samarkand, Herī or to whatever side favours fortune.\r\nMayst thou, by God's grace, crush foes and take lands to the joy of\r\nfriends and the down-casting of adversaries! Thank God! now is your time\r\nto risk life and slash swords.[2357] Neglect not the work chance has\r\nbrought; slothful life in retirement befits not sovereign rule:—\r\n\r\n   (_Persian_) He grips the world who hastens;\r\n               Empire yokes not with delay;\r\n               All else, confronting marriage, stops,\r\n               Save only sovereignty.[2358]\r\n\r\n\"If through God's grace, the Balkh and Ḥiṣār countries be won and held,\r\nput men of thine in Ḥiṣār, Kāmrān's men in Balkh. Should Samarkand also\r\nbe won, there make thy seat. Ḥiṣār, [Sidenote: Fol. 349.] God willing, I\r\nshall make a crown-domain. Should Kāmrān regard Balkh as small,\r\nrepresent the matter to me; please God! I will make its defects good at\r\nonce out of those other countries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again:—As thou knowest, the rule has always been that when thou hadst\r\nsix parts, Kāmrān had five; this having been constant, make no change.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again:—Live well with thy younger brother. Elders must bear the\r\nburden![2359] I have the hope that thou, for thy part, wilt keep on good\r\nterms with him; he, who has grown up an active and excellent youth,\r\nshould not fail, for his part, in loyal duty to thee.\"[2360]\r\n\r\n\"Again:—Words from thee are somewhat few; no person has [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n349b.] come from thee for two or three years past; the man I sent to\r\nthee (Beg Muḥammad _ta`alluqchī_) came back in something over a year; is\r\nthis not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Again:—As for the \"retirement\", \"retirement\", spoken of in thy\r\nletters,—retirement is a fault for sovereignty; as the honoured (Sa`dī)\r\nsays:—[2361]\r\n\r\n   (_Persian_) If thy foot be fettered, choose to be resigned;\r\n               If thou ride alone, take thou thine own head.\r\n\r\n\"No bondage equals that of sovereignty; retirement matches not with\r\nrule.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again:—Thou hast written me a letter, as I ordered thee to do; but why\r\nnot have read it over? If thou hadst thought of reading it, thou couldst\r\nnot have done it, and, unable thyself to read it, wouldst certainly have\r\nmade alteration in it. Though by taking trouble it can be read, it is\r\nvery puzzling, and who ever saw an enigma in prose?[2362] Thy spelling,\r\nthough not bad, is not quite correct; thou writest _iltafāt_ with _ṯā_\r\n(_iltafāṯ_) and _qūlinj_ with _yā_ (_qīlinj_?).[2363] Although thy\r\nletter can be read if every sort of pains be taken, yet it cannot be\r\nquite understood because of that obscure wording of thine. Thy\r\nremissness in letter-writing seems to be due to the thing which makes\r\nthee obscure, that is to say, to elaboration. In future write without\r\nelaboration; use plain, clear words. So will thy trouble and thy\r\nreader's be less.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again:—Thou art now to go on a great business;[2364] take counsel with\r\nprudent and experienced begs, and act as they say. If thou seek to\r\npleasure me, give up sitting alone and avoiding society. Summon thy\r\nyounger brother and the begs twice daily to thy presence, not leaving\r\ntheir coming to choice; be the business what it may, take counsel and\r\nsettle every word and act in agreement with those well-wishers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again:—Khwāja Kalān has long had with me the house-friend's intimacy;\r\nhave thou as much and even more with him. [Sidenote: Fol. 350.] If, God\r\nwilling, the work becomes less in those parts, so that thou wilt not\r\nneed Kāmrān, let him leave disciplined men in Balkh and come to my\r\npresence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again:—Seeing that there have been such victories, and such conquests,\r\nsince Kābul has been held, I take it to be well-omened; I have made it a\r\ncrown-domain; let no one of you covet it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again:—Thou hast done well (_yakhshī qīlīb sīn_); thou hast won the\r\nheart of Sl. Wais;[2365] get him to thy presence; act by his counsel,\r\nfor he knows business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Until there is a good muster of the army, do not move out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bīān Shaikh is well-apprized of word-of-mouth matters, and will inform\r\nthee of them. These things said, I salute thee and am longing to see\r\nthee.\"—\r\n\r\nThe above was written on Thursday the 13th of the first Rabi` (_Nov.\r\n26th_). To the same purport and with my own hand, I wrote also to Kāmrān\r\nand Khwāja Kalān, and sent off the letters (by Bīān Shaikh).\r\n\r\n   (_Here the record fails from Rabī` 15th to 19th._)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_y. Plans of campaign._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 2nd_) On Wednesday the 19th of the month (_Rabī` I._) the mīrzās,\r\nsulṯāns, Turk and Hind amīrs were summoned for counsel, and left the\r\nmatter at this:—That this year the army must move in some direction;\r\nthat `Askarī should go in advance towards the East, be joined by the\r\nsulṯāns and amīrs from beyond Gang (Ganges), and march in whatever\r\ndirection favoured fortune. These particulars having been written down,\r\nGhīāṣu'd-dīn the [Sidenote: Fol. 350b.] armourer was given rendezvous\r\nfor 16 days,[2366] and sent galloping off, on Saturday the 22nd of the\r\nmonth, to the amīrs of the East headed by Sl. Junaid _Barlās_. His\r\nword-of-mouth message was, that `Askarī was being sent on before the\r\nfighting apparatus, culverin, cart and matchlock, was ready; that it was\r\nthe royal order for the sulṯāns and amīrs of the far side of Gang to\r\nmuster in `Askarī's presence, and, after consultation with well-wishers\r\non that side, to move in whatever direction, God willing! might favour\r\nfortune; that if there should be work needing me, please God! I would\r\nget to horse as soon as the person gone with the (16 days) tryst\r\n(_mī`ād_) had returned; that explicit representation should be made as\r\nto whether the Bengali (Nas̤rat Shāh) were friendly and single-minded;\r\nthat, if nothing needed my presence in those parts, I should not make\r\nstay, but should move elsewhere at once;[2367] and that after consulting\r\nwith well-wishers, they were to take `Askarī with them, and, God\r\nwilling! settle matters on that side.\r\n\r\n   (_Here the record of 5 days is wanting._)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_z. `Askarī receives the insignia and rank of a royal commander._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 12th_) On Saturday the 29th of the first Rabī`, `Askarī was made\r\nto put on a jewelled dagger and belt, and a royal dress of honour, was\r\npresented with flag, horse-tail standard, [Sidenote: Fol. 351.] drum, a\r\nset (6-8) of _tīpūchāq_ (horses), 10 elephants, a string of camels, one\r\nof mules, royal plenishing, and royal utensils. Moreover he was ordered\r\nto take his seat at the head of a _Dīwān_.

After spreading a\r\ncarpet, he brought gifts. His offering in money and goods was more than\r\n2 _laks_.[2370] When food and offering had been set out, we went into\r\nanother room where sitting, we ate _ma`jūn_. We came away at the 3rd\r\nwatch (midnight?), crossed the water, and went to the private house.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_bb. The Āgra-Kābul road measured._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 17th_) On Thursday the 4th of the latter Rabī`, it was settled\r\nthat Chīqmāq Beg with Shāhī _ṯamghāchī's_[2371] clerkship, should\r\nmeasure the road between Āgra and Kābul. At every 9th _kuroh_ (_cir._\r\n18m.), a tower was to be erected 12 _qārīs_ high[2372] and having a\r\n_chār-dara_[2373] on the top; at every 18th _kuroh_ (_cir._ 36m.),[2374]\r\n6 post-horses were to be kept fastened; and arrangement was to be made\r\nfor the payment of post-masters and grooms, and for horse-corn. The\r\norder was, \"If the place where the horses are fastened up,[2375] be near\r\na crown-domain, let those there provide for the matters mentioned; if\r\nnot, let the cost be charged on the beg in whose _pargana_ the\r\npost-house may be.\" Chīqmāq Beg got out of Āgra with Shāhī on that same\r\nday.\r\n\r\n   [Sidenote: Fol. 351b.] (_Author's note on the kuroh._) These\r\n   _kurohs_ were established in relation to the _mīl_, in the way\r\n   mentioned in the _Mubīn_:—[2376]\r\n\r\n   (_Turkī_) Four thousand paces (_qadam_) are one _mīl_;\r\n               Know that Hind people call this a _kuroh_;\r\n             The pace (_qadam_) they say is a _qārī_ and a half (36 in.);\r\n               Know that each _qārī_ (24 in.) is six hand-breadths\r\n                (_tūtām_)\r\n             That each _tūtām_ is four fingers (_aīlīk_),\r\n               Each _aīlīk_, six barley-corns. Know this\r\n                     knowledge.[2377]\r\n\r\n\r\n   The measuring-cord (_ṯanāb_)[2378] was fixed at 40 _qārī_,\r\n   each being the one-and-a-half _qārī_ mentioned above, that is\r\n   to say, each is 9 hand-breadths.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_cc. A feast._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 18th_) On Saturday the 6th of the month (Rabī` II.) there was a\r\nfeast[2379] at which were present Qīzīl-bāsh (Red-head), and Aūzbeg, and\r\nHindū envoys.[2380] The Qīzīl-bāsh envoys sat under an awning placed\r\nsome 70-80 _qārīs_[2381] on my right, of the begs Yūnas-i-`alī being\r\nordered to sit with them. On my left the Aūzbeg envoys sat in the same\r\nway, of the begs `Abdu'l-lāh being ordered to sit with them. I sat on\r\nthe north side of a newly-erected octagonal pavilion (_tālār_) covered\r\nin with _khas_[2382]. Five or six _qārīs_ on my right sat Tūkhtā-būgha\r\nSl. and `Askarī, with Khwāja `Abdu'sh-shahīd and Khwāja Kalān,\r\ndescendants of his Reverence the Khwāja,[2383] and Khwāja Chishtī (var.\r\nḤusainī), and Khalīfa, together with the _ḥāfiẕes_ and _mullās_\r\ndependent on the Khwājas who had come from Samarkand. Five or six\r\n_qārīs_ on my left sat Muḥammad-i-zamān M. and Tāng-ātmīsh Sl.[2384]\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 352.] and Sayyid Rafī`, Sayyid Rūmī, Shaikh Abū'l-fatḥ,\r\nShaikh Jamālī, Shaikh Shihābu'd-dīn _`Arab_ and Sayyid Daknī (var.Zaknī,\r\nRuknī). Before food all the sulṯāns, khāns, grandees, and amīrs brought\r\ngifts[2385] of red, of white, of black,[2386] of cloth and various other\r\ngoods. They poured the red and white on a carpet I had ordered spread,\r\nand side by side with the gold and silver piled plenishing, white cotton\r\npiece-cloth and purses (_badra_) of money. While the gifts were being\r\nbrought and before food, fierce camels and fierce elephants[2387] were\r\nset to fight on an island opposite,[2388] so too a few rams; thereafter\r\nwrestlers grappled. After the chief of the food had been set out,\r\nKhwāja `Abdu'sh-shahīd and Khwāja Kalān were made to put on surtouts\r\n(_jabbah_) of fine muslin,[2389] spotted with gold-embroidery, and\r\nsuitable dresses of honour, and those headed by Mullā Farrūkh and\r\n_Ḥāfiẕ_[2390] had jackets put on them. On Kūchūm Khān's envoy[2391] and\r\non Ḥasan _Chalabi's_ younger brother[2392] were bestowed silken\r\nhead-wear (_bāshlīq_) and gold-embroidered surtouts of fine muslin, with\r\nsuitable dresses of honour. Gold-embroidered jackets and silk coats were\r\npresented to the envoys of Abū-sa`īd Sl. (_Aūzbeg_), of Mihr-bān Khānīm\r\nand her son Pulād Sl., and of Shāh Ḥasan [Sidenote: Fol. 352b.]\r\n(_Arghūn_). The two Khwājas and the two chief envoys, that is to say\r\nKūchūm Khān's retainer and Ḥasan _Chalabī's_ younger brother, were\r\npresented with a silver stone's weight of gold and a gold stone's weight\r\nof silver.\r\n\r\n   (_Author's note on the Turkī stone-weight._) The gold stone\r\n   (_tāsh_) is 500 _mis̤qāls_, that is to say, one Kābul _sīr_;\r\n   the silver stone is 250 _mis̤qāls_, that is to say, half a\r\n   Kābul _sīr_.[2393]\r\n\r\nTo Khwāja Mīr Sulṯān and his sons, to Ḥāfiẕ of Tāshkīnt, to Mullā\r\nFarrūkh at the head of the Khwājas' servants, and also to other envoys,\r\nsilver and gold were given with a quiver.[2394] Yādgār-i-nāṣir[2395] was\r\npresented with a dagger and belt. On Mīr Muḥammad the raftsman who was\r\ndeserving of reward for the excellent bridge he had made over the river\r\nGang (Ganges),[2396] a dagger was bestowed, so too on the matchlockmen\r\nChampion [_pahlawān_] Ḥājī Muḥammad and Champion Buhlūl and on Walī the\r\ncheeta-keeper (_pārschī_); one was given to Ustād `Alī's son also. Gold\r\nand silver were presented to Sayyid Daud _Garmsīrī_. Jackets having\r\nbuttons,[2397] and silk dresses of honour were presented to the servants\r\nof my daughter Ma`ṣūma[2398] and my son Hind-āl. Again:—presents of\r\njackets and silk dresses of honour, of gold and silver, of plenishing\r\nand various goods were given to those from Andijān, and to those who had\r\ncome from Sūkh and Hushīār, the places whither we had gone landless and\r\nhomeless.[2399] Gifts of the same kind were given to the servants of\r\nQurbān and Shaikhī and the peasants of Kāhmard.[2400] [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n353.]\r\n\r\nAfter food had been sent out, Hindūstānī players were ordered to come\r\nand show their tricks. Lūlīs came.[2401] Hindūstānī performers shew\r\nseveral feats not shewn by (Tramontane) ones. One is this:—They arrange\r\nseven rings, one on the forehead, two on the knees, two of the remaining\r\nfour on fingers, two on toes, and in an instant set them turning\r\nrapidly. Another is this:—Imitating the port of the peacock, they place\r\none hand on the ground, raise up the other and both legs, and then in an\r\ninstant make rings on the uplifted hand and feet revolve rapidly.\r\nAnother is this:—In those (Tramontane) countries two people grip one\r\nanother and turn two somersaults, but Hindūstānī _lūlīs_, clinging\r\ntogether, go turning over three or four times. Another is this:—a _lūlī_\r\nsets the end of a 12 or 14 foot pole on his middle and holds it upright\r\nwhile another climbs up it and does his [Sidenote: Fol. 353b.] tricks up\r\nthere. Another is this:—A small _lūlī_ gets upon a big one's head, and\r\nstands there upright while the big one moves quickly from side to side\r\nshewing his tricks, the little one shewing his on the big one's head,\r\nquite upright and without tottering. Many dancing-girls came also and\r\ndanced.\r\n\r\nA mass of red, white, and black was scattered (_sāchīldī_) on which\r\nfollowed amazing noise and pushing. Between the Evening and Bed-time\r\nPrayers I made five or six special people sit in my presence for over\r\none watch. At the second watch of the day (9 a.m., _Sunday, Rabi` II.\r\n7th_) having sat in a boat, I went to the Eight-Paradises.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_dd. `Askarī starts eastwards._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 20th_) On Monday (_8th_) `Askarī who had got (his army) out (of\r\nĀgra) for the expedition, came to the Hot-bath, took leave of me and\r\nmarched for the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ee. A visit to Dhūlpūr._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 21st_) On Tuesday (_Rabī` II. 9th_) I went to see the buildings\r\nfor a reservoir and well at Dūlpūr.[2402] I rode from the (Āgra) garden\r\nat one watch (_pahr_) and one _garī_ (9.22 a.m.), and I entered the\r\nDūlpūr garden when 5 _garīs_ of the 1st night-watch (_pās_)[2403] had\r\ngone (7.40 p.m.).[2404]\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 23rd_) On Thursday the 11th day of the month the stone-well\r\n(_sangīn-chāh_), the 26 rock-spouts (_tāsh-tār-nau_) and rock-pillars\r\n(_tāsh-sitūn_), and the water-courses (_ārīqlār_) cut on the solid slope\r\n(_yak pāra qīā_) were all ready.[2405] At the 3rd watch (_pahr_) of this\r\nsame day preparation for drawing water from the well was made. On\r\naccount of a smell (_aīd_) in the water, it was ordered, for prudence'\r\nsake, that they should turn the well-wheel without rest for 15\r\ndays-and-nights, and so draw off the water. Gifts were made to the\r\nstone-cutters, and labourers, [Sidenote: Fol. 354.] and the whole body\r\nof workmen in the way customary for master-workmen and wage-earners of\r\nĀgra.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 24th_) We rode from Dūlpūr while one _garī_ of the 1st watch\r\n(_pahr_) of Friday remained (_cir._ 8.40 a.m.), and we crossed the river\r\n(Jumna) before the Sun had set.\r\n\r\n   (_Here the record of 3 days is wanting._)[2406]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ff. A Persian account of the battle of Jām._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 28th_) On Tuesday the 16th of the month (_Rabī` II._) came one of\r\nDīv Sl.'s[2407] servants, a man who had been in the fight between the\r\nQīzīl-bāsh and Aūzbeg, and who thus described it:—The battle between the\r\nAūzbegs and Turkmāns[2408] took place on `Āshūr-day (_Muḥ. 10th_) near\r\nJām-and-Khirgird.[2409] They fought from the first dawn till the Mid-day\r\nPrayer. The Aūzbegs were 300,000; the Turkmāns may have been (as is\r\nsaid?) 40 to 50,000; he said that he himself estimated their dark mass\r\nat 100,000; on the other hand, the Aūzbegs said they themselves were\r\n100,000. The Qīzīl-bāsh leader (_ādam_) fought after arraying cart,\r\nculverin and matchlockmen in the Rūmī fashion, and after protecting\r\nhimself.[2410] Shāh-zāda[2411] and Jūha Sl. stood behind the carts with\r\n20,000 good braves. The rest of the begs were posted right and left\r\nbeyond the carts. [Sidenote: Fol. 354b.] These the Aūzbeg beat at once\r\non coming up, dismounted and overcame many, making all scurry off. He\r\nthen wheeled to the (Qīzīl-bāsh) rear and took loot in camel and\r\nbaggage. At length those behind the carts loosed the chains and came\r\nout. Here also the fight was hard. Thrice they flung the Aūzbeg back; by\r\nGod's grace they beat him. Nine sulṯāns, with Kūchūm Khān, `Ubaid Khān\r\nand Abū-sa`īd Sl. at their head, were captured; one, Abū-sa`īd Sl. is\r\nsaid to be alive; the rest have gone to death.[2412] `Ubaid Khān's body\r\nwas found, but not his head. Of Aūzbegs 50,000, and of Turkmāns 20,000\r\nwere slain.[2413]\r\n\r\n   (_Here matter seems to have been lost._)[2414]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_gg. Plan of campaign._)\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 30th_) On this same day (Thursday _Rabī` II. 18th_) came\r\nGhīāṣu'd-dīn the armourer[2415] who had gone to Jūna-pūr (Jūnpūr) with\r\ntryst of 16 days,[2416] but, as Sl. Junaid and the rest had led out\r\ntheir army for Kharīd,[2417] he (Ghīāṣu'd-dīn) was not able to be back\r\nat the time fixed.[2418] Sl. Junaid said, by word-of-mouth, \"Thank God!\r\nthrough His grace, no work worth the Pādshāh's attention has shewn\r\nitself in these parts; if the honoured Mīrzā (`Askarī) come, and if the\r\nsulṯāns, khāns and amīrs here-abouts be ordered to move in his steps,\r\nthere is hope that everything in these parts will be arranged with\r\nease.\" Though such was Sl. [Sidenote: Fol. 355.] Junaid's answer,yet, as\r\npeople were saying that Mullā Muḥammad Maẕhab, who had been sent as\r\nenvoy to Bengal after the Holy-battle with Sangā the Pagan,[2419] would\r\narrive today or tomorrow, his news also was awaited.\r\n\r\n(_Dec. 31st_) On Friday the 19th of the month I had eaten ma`jūn and was\r\nsitting with a special few in the private house, when Mullā Maẕhab who\r\nhad arrived late, that is to say, in the night of Saturday,[2420] came\r\nand waited on me. By asking one particular after another, we got to know\r\nthat the attitude of the Bengalī[2421] was understood to be loyal and\r\nsingle-minded.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 2nd_) On Sunday (_Rabī` II. 21st_), I summoned the Turk and Hind\r\namīrs to the private house, when counsel was taken and the following\r\nmatters were brought forward:—As the Bengalī (Naṣrat Shāh) has sent us\r\nan envoy[2422] and is said to be loyal and single-minded, to go to\r\nBengal itself would be improper; if the move be not on Bengal, no other\r\nplace on that side has treasure helpful for the army; several places to\r\nthe west are both rich and near,\r\n\r\n   (_Turkī_) Abounding wealth, a pagan people, a short road;\r\n             Far though the East lie, this is near.\r\n\r\nAt length the matter found settlement at this:—As our westward road is\r\nshort, it will be all one if we delay a few days, so that our minds may\r\nbe at ease about the East. Again Ghīāṣu'd-dīn [Sidenote: Fol. 355b.] the\r\narmourer was made to gallop off, with tryst of 20 days,[2423] to convey\r\nwritten orders to the eastern amīrs for all the sulṯāns, khāns, and\r\namīrs who had assembled in `Askarī's presence, to move against those\r\nrebels.[2424] The orders delivered, he was to return by the trysted day\r\nwith what ever news there might be.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_hh. Balūchī incursions._)\r\n\r\nIn these days Muḥammadī Kūkūldāsh made dutiful representation that again\r\nBalūchīs had come and overrun several places. Chīn-tīmūr Sl. was\r\nappointed for the business; he was to gather to his presence the amīrs\r\nfrom beyond Sihrind and Samāna and with them, equipped for 6 months, to\r\nproceed against the Balūchīs; namely, such amīrs as `Ādil Sulṯān, Sl.\r\nMuḥ. _Dūldāī_, Khusrau Kūkūldāsh, Muḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang_,\r\n`Abdu'l-`azīz the Master-of-the-horse, Sayyid `Alī, Walī Qīzil, Qarācha,\r\nHalāhil, `Āshiq the House-steward, Shaikh `Alī, Kitta (_Beg Kuhbur_),\r\nGujūr Khān, Ḥasan `Alī _Sīwādī_. These were to present themselves at the\r\nSulṯān's call and muster and not to transgress his word by road or in\r\nhalt.[2425] The messenger[2426] appointed to carry these orders was\r\n`Abdu'l-ghaffār; he was to deliver them first to Chīn-tīmūr Sl.,\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 356.] then to go on and shew them to the afore-named\r\nbegs who were to present themselves with their troops at whatever place\r\nthe Sulṯān gave rendezvous (_būljār_);[2427] `Abdu'l-ghaffār himself was\r\nto remain with the army and was to make dutiful representation of\r\nslackness or carelessness if shewn by any person soever; this done, we\r\nshould remove the offender from the circle of the approved\r\n(_muwajjah-jīrgāsī_) and from his country or _pargana_. These orders\r\nhaving been entrusted to `Abdu'l-ghaffār, words-of-mouth were made known\r\nto him and he was given leave to go.\r\n\r\n   (_The last explicit date is a week back._)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ii. News of the loss of Bihār reaches Dhūlpūr._)\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 9th_) On the eve of Sunday the 28th of the month (_Rabi` II._) we\r\ncrossed the Jūn (Jumna) at the 6th _garī_ of the 3rd watch (2.15 a.m.)\r\nand started for the Lotus-garden of Dūlpūr. The 3rd watch was near[2428]\r\n(Sunday mid-day) when we reached it. Places were assigned on the border\r\nof the garden, where begs and the household might build or make\r\ncamping-grounds for themselves.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 13th_) On Thursday the 3rd of the first Jumāda, a place was fixed\r\nin the s.e. of the garden for a Hot-bath; the ground was to be levelled;\r\nI ordered a plinth(?) (_kursī_) erected on the levelled ground, and a\r\nBath to be arranged, in one room of which was to be a reservoir 10 X 10.\r\n\r\nOn this same day Khalīfa sent from Āgra dutiful letters of Qāẓī Jīā and\r\nBīr-sing Deo, saying it had been heard said that Iskandar's son Maḥmūd\r\n(_Lūdī_) had taken Bihār (town). This news decided for getting the army\r\nto horse.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 14th_) On Friday (_Jumāda I. 4th_), we rode out from the\r\nLotus-garden at the 6th _garī_ (8.15 a.m.); at the Evening Prayer we\r\nreached Āgra. We met Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā on the road who would have\r\ngone to Dūlpūr, Chīn-tīmūr also who must have been coming into\r\nAgra.[2429]\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 15th_) On Saturday (_5th_) the counselling begs having been\r\nsummoned, it was settled to ride eastwards on Thursday the 10th of the\r\nmonth (_Jan. 21st_).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_jj. News of Badakhshān._)\r\n\r\nOn this same Saturday letters came from Kābul with news [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n356b.] that Humāyūn, having mustered the army on that side (Tramontana),\r\nand joined Sl. Wais to himself, had set out with 40,000 men for\r\nSamarkand;[2430] on this Sl. Wais' younger brother Shāh-qūlī goes and\r\nenters Ḥiṣār, Tarsūn Muḥammad leaves Tirmiẕ, takes Qabādīān and asks for\r\nhelp; Humāyūn sends Tūlik Kūkūldāsh and Mīr Khẉurd[2431] with many of\r\nhis men and what Mughūls there were, then follows himself.[2432]\r\n\r\n   (_Here 4 days record is wanting._)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_kk. Bābur starts for the East._)\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 20th_) On Thursday the 10th of the first Jumāda, I set [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 357.] out for the East after the 3rd _garī_ (_cir._ 7.10 a.m.),\r\ncrossed Jūn by boat a little above Jalīsīr, and went to the\r\nGold-scattering-garden.[2433] It was ordered that the standard (_tūgh_),\r\ndrum, stable and all the army-folk should remain on the other side of\r\nthe water, opposite to the garden, and that persons coming for an\r\ninterview[2434] should cross by boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ll. Arrivals._)\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 22nd_) On Saturday (_12th_) Ismā`īl Mītā, the Bengal envoy\r\nbrought the Bengalī's offering (Naṣrat Shāh's), and waited on me in\r\nHindūstān fashion, advancing to within an arrow's flight, making his\r\nreverence, and retiring. They then put on him the due dress of honour\r\n(_khi`lat_) which people call * * * *[2435], and brought him before me.\r\nHe knelt thrice in our fashion, advanced, handed Naṣrat Shāh's letter,\r\nset before me the offering he had brought, and retired.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 24th_) On Monday (_14th_) the honoured Khwāja `Abdu'l-ḥaqq having\r\narrived, I crossed the water by boat, went to his tents and waited on\r\nhim.[2436]\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 25th_) On Tuesday (_15th_) Ḥasan _Chalabī_ arrived and waited on\r\nme.[2437]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_mm. Incidents of the eastward march._)\r\n\r\nOn account of our aims (_chāpdūq_) for the army,[2438] some days were\r\nspent in the Chār-bāgh.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 27th_) On Thursday the 17th of the month, that ground was left\r\nafter the 3rd _garī_ (7.10 a.m.), I going by boat. It was dismounted 7\r\n_kurohs_ (14 m.) from Āgra, at the village of Anwār.[2439]\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 30th_) On Sunday (_Jumāda I. 20th_), the Aūzbeg envoys were given\r\ntheir leave. To Kūchūm Khān's envoy Amīn Mīrzā were presented a dagger\r\nwith belt, cloth of gold,[2440] and 70,000 _tankas_.[2441] Abū-sa`īd's\r\nservant Mullā T̤aghāī and the servants of [Sidenote: Fol. 357b.]\r\nMihr-bān Khānim and her son Pūlād Sl. were made to put on dresses of\r\nhonour with gold-embroidered jackets, and were presented also with money\r\nin accordance with their station.\r\n\r\n(_Jan. 31st_?) Next morning[2442] (_Monday 21st_?) leave was given to\r\nKhwāja `Abdu'l-ḥaqq for stay in Āgra and to Khwāja Yaḥyā's grandson\r\nKhwāja Kalān for Samarkand, who had come by way of a mission from Aūzbeg\r\nkhāns and sulṯāns.[2443]\r\n\r\nIn congratulation on the birth of Humāyūn's son and Kāmrān's marriage,\r\nMullā Tabrīzī and Mīrzā Beg T̤aghāī[2444] were sent with gifts\r\n(_sāchāq_) to each Mīrzā of 10,000 _shāhrukhīs_, a coat I had worn, and\r\na belt with clasps. Through Mullā Bihishtī were sent to Hind-āl an\r\ninlaid dagger with belt, an inlaid ink-stand, a stool worked in\r\nmother-o'pearl, a tunic and a girdle,[2445] together with the alphabet\r\nof the Bāburī script and fragments (_qiṯa`lār_) written in that script.\r\nTo Humāyūn were sent the translation (_tarjuma_) and verses made in\r\nHindūstān.[2446] To Hind-āl and Khwāja Kalān also the translation and\r\nverses were sent. They were sent too to Kāmrān, through Mīrzā Beg\r\nT̤aghāī, together with head-lines (_sar-khaṯ_) in the Bāburī\r\nscript.[2447]\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 1st_) On Tuesday, after writing letters to be taken by those\r\ngoing to Kābul, the buildings in hand at Āgra and Dūlpūr [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n358.] were recalled to mind, and entrusted to the charge of Mullā Qāsim,\r\nUstād Shāh Muḥammad the stone-cutter, Mīrak, Mīr Ghīāṣ, Mīr Sang-tarāsh\r\n(stone-cutter) and Shāh Bābā the spadesman. Their leave was then given\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 2nd_) The first watch (6 a.m.) was near[2448] when we rode out\r\nfrom Anwār (_Wednesday, Jumāda I. 23rd_); in the end,[2449] we\r\ndismounted, at the Mid-day Prayer, in the village of Ābāpūr, one _kuroh_\r\n(2 m.) from Chandawār.[2450]\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 3rd_) On the eve of Thursday (_24th_)[2451] `Abdu'l-malūk the\r\narmourer[2452] was joined with Ḥasan _Chalabī_ and sent as envoy to the\r\nShāh[2453]; and Chāpūq[2454] was joined with the Aūzbeg envoys and sent\r\nto the Aūzbeg khāns and sulṯāns.\r\n\r\nWe moved from Ābāpūr while 4 _garīs_ of the night remained (4.30 a.m.).\r\nAfter passing Chandawār at the top of the dawn, I got into a boat. I\r\nlanded in front of Rāprī and at the Bed-time Prayer got to the camp\r\nwhich was at Fatḥpūr.[2455]\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 4th and 5th_) Having stayed one day (_Friday_) at Fatḥpūr, we got\r\nto horse on Saturday (_26th_) after making ablution (_waẓū_) at dawn. We\r\nwent through the Morning Prayer in assembly near Rāprī, Maulānā Muḥammad\r\nof Fārāb being the leader (_imām_). At sun-rise I got into a boat below\r\nthe great crook[2456] of Rāprī.\r\n\r\nToday I put together a line-marker (_misṯar_) of eleven lines[2457] in\r\norder to write the mixed hands of the translation.[2458] Today the\r\nwords of the honoured man-of-God admonished my heart.[2459]\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 6th_) Opposite Jākīn,[2460] one of the Rāprī _parganas_, we\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 358b.] had the boats drawn to the bank and just spent\r\nthe night in them. We had them moved on from that place before the dawn\r\n(_Sunday 27th_), after having gone through the Morning Prayer. When I\r\nwas again on board, Pay-master Sl. Muḥammad came, bringing a servant of\r\nKhwāja Kalān, Shamsu'd-dīn Muḥammad, from whose letters and information\r\nparticulars about the affairs of Kābul became known.[2461] Mahdī Khwāja\r\nalso came when I was in the boat.[2462] At the Mid-day Prayer I landed\r\nin a garden opposite Etāwa, there bathed (_ghusl_) in the Jūn, and\r\nfulfilled the duty of prayer. Moving nearer towards Etāwa, we sat down\r\nin that same garden under trees on a height over-looking the river, and\r\nthere set the braves to amuse us.[2463] Food ordered by Mahdī Khwāja,\r\nwas set before us. At the Evening Prayer we crossed the river; at the\r\nbed-time one we reached camp.\r\n\r\nThere was a two or three days' delay on that ground both to collect the\r\narmy, and to write letters in answer to those brought by Shamsu'd-dīn\r\nMuḥammad.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_nn. Letters various._)\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 9th_) On Wednesday the last day (_30th_) of the 1st Jumāda, we\r\nmarched from Etāwa, and after doing 8 _kurohs_ (16m.), dismounted at\r\nMūrī-and-Adūsa.[2464]\r\n\r\nSeveral remaining letters for Kābul were written on this same ground.\r\nOne to Humāyūn was to this purport:—If the work have not yet been done\r\nsatisfactorily, stop the raiders and thieves thyself; do not let them\r\nembroil the peace now descending amongst the peoples.[2465] Again, there\r\nwas this:—I have made [Sidenote: Fol. 359.] Kābul a crown-domain, let no\r\nson of mine covet it. Again:—that I had summoned Hind-āl.\r\n\r\nKāmrān, for his part, was written to about taking the best of care in\r\nintercourse with the Shāh-zāda,[2466] about my bestowal on himself of\r\nMultān, making Kābul a crown-domain, and the coming of my family and\r\ntrain.[2467]\r\n\r\nAs my letter to Khwāja Kalān makes several particulars known, it is\r\ncopied in here without alteration:—[2468]\r\n\r\n\r\n[COPY OF A LETTER TO KHWĀJA KALĀN.]\r\n\r\n\"After saying 'Salutation to Khwāja Kalān', the first matter is that\r\nShamsu'd-dīn Muḥammad has reached Etāwa, and that the particulars about\r\nKābul are known.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boundless and infinite is my desire to go to those parts.[2469] Matters\r\nare coming to some sort of settlement in Hindūstān; there is hope,\r\nthrough the Most High, that the work here will soon be arranged. This\r\nwork brought to order, God willing! my start will be made at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"How should a person forget the pleasant things of those countries,\r\nespecially one who has repented and vowed to sin no more? How should he\r\nbanish from his mind the permitted flavours of melons and grapes? Taking\r\nthis opportunity,[2470] a melon was brought to me; to cut and eat it\r\naffected me strangely; I was all tears!\"\r\n\r\n\"The unsettled state[2471] of Kābul had already been written of\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 359b.] to me. After thinking matters over, my choice\r\nfell on this:—How should a country hold together and be strong (_marbūṯ\r\nu maẓbūṯ_), if it have seven or eight Governors? Under this aspect of\r\nthe affair, I have summoned my elder sister (Khān-zāda) and my wives to\r\nHindūstān, have made Kābul and its neighbouring countries a\r\ncrown-domain, and have written in this sense to both Humāyūn and Kāmrān.\r\nLet a capable person take those letters to the Mīrzās. As you may know\r\nalready, I had written earlier to them with the same purport. About the\r\nsafe-guarding and prosperity of the country, there will now be no\r\nexcuse, and not a word to say. Henceforth, if the town-wall[2472] be not\r\nsolid or subjects not thriving, if provisions be not in store or the\r\nTreasury not full, it will all be laid on the back of the inefficiency\r\nof the Pillar-of-the State.\"[2473]\r\n\r\n\"The things that must be done are specified below; for some of them\r\norders have gone already, one of these being, 'Let treasure accumulate.'\r\nThe things which must be done are these:—First, the repair of the fort;\r\nagain:—the provision of stores; again:—the daily allowance and\r\nlodging[2474] of envoys going backwards and forwards[2475]; again:—let\r\nmoney, taken legally from revenue,[2476] be spent for building the\r\nCongregational Mosque; again:—the repairs of the Kārwan-sarā\r\n(Caravan-sarai) and the Hot-baths; again:—the completion of the\r\nunfinished building [Sidenote: Fol. 360.] made of burnt-brick which\r\nŪstād Ḥasan `Alī was constructing in the citadel. Let this work be\r\nordered after taking counsel with Ūstād Sl. Muḥammad; if a design exist,\r\ndrawn earlier by Ūstād Ḥasan `Alī, let Ūstād Sl. Muḥammad finish the\r\nbuilding precisely according to it; if not, let him do so, after making\r\na gracious and harmonious design, and in such a way that its floor shall\r\nbe level with that of the Audience-hall; again:—the Khẉurd-Kābul dam\r\nwhich is to hold up the But-khāk-water at its exit from the Khẉurd-Kābul\r\nnarrows; again:—the repair of the Ghaznī dam[2477]; again:—the\r\nAvenue-garden in which water is short and for which a one-mill stream\r\nmust be diverted[2478]; again:—I had water brought from Tūtūm-dara to\r\nrising ground south-west of Khwāja Basta, there made a reservoir and\r\nplanted young trees. The place got the name of Belvedere,[2479] because\r\nit faces the ford and gives a first-rate view. The best of young trees\r\nmust be planted there, lawns arranged, and borders set with sweet-herbs\r\nand with flowers of beautiful colour and scent; again:—Sayyid Qāsim has\r\nbeen named to reinforce thee; again:—do not neglect the condition of\r\nmatchlockmen and of Ūstād Muḥammad Amīn the armourer[2480];\r\nagain:—directly this letter arrives, thou must get my elder sister\r\n(Khān-zāda Begīm) and my wives right out of Kābul, and escort them to\r\nNīl-āb. However averse they may still be, they most certainly must start\r\nwithin a week of the arrival of [Sidenote: Fol. 360b.] this letter. For\r\nwhy? Both because the armies which have gone from Hindūstān to escort\r\nthem are suffering hardship in a cramped place (_tār yīrdā_), and also\r\nbecause they[2481] are ruining the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again:—I made it clear in a letter written to `Abdu'l-lāh (_`asas_),\r\nthat there had been very great confusion in my mind (_dúghdugha_), to\r\ncounterbalance being in the oasis (_wādī_) of penitence. This quatrain\r\nwas somewhat dissuading (_mānī`_):—[2482]\r\n\r\n   Through renouncement of wine bewildered am I;\r\n   How to work know I not, so distracted am I;\r\n   While others repent and make vow to abstain,\r\n   I have vowed to abstain, and repentant am I.\r\n\r\n\"A witticism of Banāī's came back to my mind:—One day when he had been\r\njoking in `Alī-sher Beg's presence, who must have been wearing a jacket\r\nwith buttons,[2483] `Alī-sher Beg said, 'Thou makest charming jokes; but\r\nfor the buttons, I would give thee the jacket; they are the hindrance\r\n(_māni`_).' Said Banāī, 'What hindrance are buttons? It is button-holes\r\n(_mādagī_) that hinder.'[2484] Let responsibility for this story lie on\r\nthe teller! hold me excused for it; for God's sake do not be offended by\r\nit.[2485] Again:—that quatrain was made before last year, and in truth\r\nthe longing and craving for a wine-party has been infinite and endless\r\nfor two years past, so much so that sometimes the craving for wine\r\nbrought me to the verge of tears. Thank God! this year that trouble has\r\npassed from my mind, perhaps by virtue of the [Sidenote: Fol. 361.]\r\nblessing and sustainment of versifying the translation.[2486] Do thou\r\nalso renounce wine! If had with equal associates and boon-companions,\r\nwine and company are pleasant things; but with whom canst thou now\r\nassociate? with whom drink wine? If thy boon-companions are Sher-i-aḥmad\r\nand Ḥaidar-qulī, it should not be hard for thee to forswear wine. So\r\nmuch said, I salute thee and long to see thee.\"[2487]\r\n\r\nThe above letter was written on Thursday the 1st of the latter Jumāda\r\n(_Feb. 10th_). It affected me greatly to write concerning those\r\nmatters, with their mingling of counsel. The letters were entrusted to\r\nShamsu'd-dīn Muḥammad on Friday night,[2488] he was apprized of\r\nword-of-mouth messages and given leave to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_oo. Complaints from Balkh._)\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 11th_) On Friday (_Jumāda II. 2nd_) we did 8 _kurohs_ (16m.) and\r\ndismounted at Jumandnā.[2489] Today a servant of Kītīn-qarā Sl. arrived\r\nwhom the Sulṯān had sent to his retainer and envoy Kamālu'd-din\r\n_Qīāq_,[2490] with things written concerning the behaviour of the begs\r\nof the (Balkh) border, their intercourse with himself, and complaints of\r\ntheft and raid. Leave to go was given to _Qīāq_, and orders were issued\r\nto the begs of the border to put an end to raiding and thieving, to\r\nbehave well and to maintain intercourse with Balkh. These orders were\r\nentrusted to Kītīn-qarā Sl.'s servant and he was dismissed from this\r\nground.\r\n\r\nA letter, accepting excuse for the belated arrival of Ḥasan\r\n_Chalabī_,[2491] was sent to the Shāh today by one Shāh-qulī who had\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 361b.] come to me from Ḥasan _Chalabī_ and reported the\r\ndetails of the battle (of Jām).[2492] Shāh-qulī was given his leave on\r\nthis same day, the 2nd of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_pp. Incidents of the eastward march resumed._)\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 12th_) On Saturday (_3rd_) we did 8 _kurohs_ (16m.) and\r\ndismounted in the Kakūra and Chachāwalī[2493] _parganas_ of Kālpī.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 13th_) On Sunday the 4th of the month, we did 9 _kurohs_ (18m.)\r\nand dismounted in Dīrapūr[2494] a _pargana_ of Kālpī. Here I shaved my\r\nhead,[2495] which I had not done for the past two months, and bathed in\r\nthe Sīngar-water (Sengar).\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 14th_) On Monday (_5th_) we did 14 _kurohs_ (28m.), and\r\ndismounted in Chaparkada[2496] one of the _parganas_ of Kālpī.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 15th_) At the dawn of Tuesday (_6th_), a Hindūstānī servant of\r\nQarācha's arrived who had taken a command (_farmān_) from Māhīm to\r\nQarācha from which it was understood that she was on the road. She had\r\nsummoned escort from people in Lāhor, Bhīra and those parts in the\r\nfashion I formerly wrote orders (_parwānas_) with my own hand. Her\r\ncommand had been written in Kābul on the 7th of the 1st Jumāda (_Jan.\r\n17th_).[2497]\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 16th_) On Wednesday (_7th_) we did 7 _kurohs_ (14m.), and\r\ndismounted in the Ādampūr _pargana_.[2498] Today I mounted before dawn,\r\ntook the road[2499] alone, reached the Jūn (Jumna), and went on along\r\nits bank. When I came opposite to Ādampūr, I had awnings set up on an\r\nisland (_ārāl_) near the camp and seated there, ate _ma`jūn_.\r\n\r\nToday we set Ṣādiq to wrestle with Kalāl who had come to [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n362.] Āgra with a challenge.[2500] In Āgra he had asked respite for 20\r\ndays on the plea of fatigue from his journey; as now 40-50 days had\r\npassed since the end of his respite, he was obliged to wrestle. Ṣādiq\r\ndid very well, throwing him easily. Ṣādiq was given 10,000 _tankas_, a\r\nsaddled horse, a head-to-foot, and a jacket with buttons; while Kalāl,\r\nto save him from despair, was given 3000 _tankas_, spite of his fall.\r\n\r\nThe carts and mortar were ordered landed from the boats, and we spent 3\r\nor 4 days on this same ground while the road was made ready, the ground\r\nlevelled and the landing effected.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 21st_) On Monday the 12th of the month (_Jumāda II._), we did 12\r\n_kurohs_ (24 m.) and dismounted at Kūrarah.[2501] Today I travelled by\r\nlitter.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 22nd-25th_) After marching 12 _kurohs_ (24 m.) from Kūrarah\r\n(_13th_), we dismounted in Kūrīa[2502] a _pargana_ of Karrah. From Kūrīa\r\nwe marched 8 _kurohs_ (16m.) and dismounted (_14th_) in\r\nFatḥpūr-Aswa.[2503] After 8 _kurohs_ (16m.) done from Fatḥpūr, we\r\ndismounted (_15th_) at Sarāī Munda.[2504]... Today at the Bedtime Prayer\r\n(_Friday 16th_, _after dark_), Sl. Jalālu'd-dīn (_Sharqī_)[2505] came\r\nwith his two young sons to wait on me.\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 26th_) Next day, Saturday the 17th of the month, we did 8\r\n_kurohs_ (16m.), and dismounted at Dugdugī a Karrah _pargana_ on the\r\nbank of the Gang.[2506]\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 27th_) On Sunday (_18th_) came to this ground Muḥammad Sl. M.,\r\nNī-khūb (or, Bī-khūb) Sl. and Tardīka (or, Tardī _yakka_, [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 362b.] champion).\r\n\r\n(_Feb. 28th_) On Monday (_19th_) `Askarī also waited on me. They all\r\ncame from the other side of Gang (Ganges). `Askarī and his various\r\nforces were ordered to march along the other bank of the river keeping\r\nopposite the army on this side, and wherever our camp might be, to\r\ndismount just opposite it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_qq. News of the Afghāns._)\r\n\r\nWhile we were in these parts news came again and again that Sl. Maḥmūd\r\n(_Lūdī_) had collected 10,000 Afghāns; that he had detached Shaikh\r\nBāyazīd and Bīban with a mass of men towards Sarwār [Gorakhpūr];\r\nthat he himself with Fatḥ Khān _Sarwānī_ was on his way along the\r\nriver for Chunār; that Sher Khān _Sūr_ whom I had favoured last year\r\nwith the gift of several _parganas_ and had left in charge of this\r\nneighbourhood,[2507] had joined these Afghāns who thereupon had made him\r\nand a few other amīrs cross the water; that Sl. Jalālu'd-dīn's man in\r\nBenares had not been able to hold that place, had fled, and got away;\r\nwhat he was understood to have said being, that he had left soldiers\r\n(_sipahīlār_) in Benares-fort and gone along the river to fight Sl.\r\nMaḥmūd.[2508]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_rr. Incidents of the march resumed._)\r\n\r\n(_March 1st_) Marching from Dugdugī (_Tuesday, Jumāda II. 20th_) the\r\narmy did 6 _kurohs_ (12m.) and dismounted at Kusār,[2509] 3 or 4\r\n_kurohs_ from Karrah. I went by boat. We stayed here 3 or 4 [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 363.] days because of hospitality offered by Sl. Jalālu'd-dīn.\r\n\r\n(_March 4th_) On Friday (_23rd_), I dismounted at Sl. Jalālu'd-dīn's\r\nhouse inside Karrah-fort where, host-like, he served me a portion of\r\ncooked meat and other viands.[2510] After the meal, he and his sons were\r\ndressed in unlined coats (_yaktāī jāmah_) and short tunics\r\n(_nīmcha_).[2511] At his request his elder son was given the style Sl.\r\nMaḥmūd.[2512] On leaving Karrah, I rode about one _kuroh_ (2m.) and\r\ndismounted on the bank of Gang.\r\n\r\nHere letters were written and leave was given to Shahrak Beg who had\r\ncome from Māhīm to our first camp on Gang (_i.e._ Dugdugī). As Khwāja\r\nYaḥyā's grandson Khwāja Kalān had been asking for the records I was\r\nwriting,[2513] I sent him by Shahrak a copy I had had made.\r\n\r\n(_March 5th_) On Saturday move was made at dawn (_24th_), I going by\r\nboat direct, and after 4 _kurohs_ done (8m.), halt was made at\r\nKoh.[2514] Our ground, being so near, was reached quite early. After\r\nawhile, we seated ourselves inside[2515] a boat where we ate _ma`jūn_.\r\nWe invited the honoured Khwāja `Abdu'sh-shahīd[2516] who was said to be\r\nin Nūr Beg's quarters (_awī_), invited also Mullā Maḥmūd (_Farābī_?),\r\nbringing him from Mullā `Alī Khān's. After staying for some time on that\r\nspot, we crossed the river, and on the other side, set wrestlers to\r\nwrestle. In opposition to the rule of gripping the strongest first,\r\nDost-i-yāsīn-khair [Sidenote: Fol. 363b.] was told not to grapple with\r\nChampion Ṣādiq, but with others; he did so very well with eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ss. News of the Afghān enemy._)\r\n\r\nAt the Afternoon Prayer, Sl. Muḥammad the Pay-master came by boat from\r\nthe other side of the river, bringing news that the army of Sl.\r\nIskandar's son Maḥmūd Khān whom rebels style Sl. Maḥmūd,[2517] had\r\nbroken up. The same news was brought in by a spy who had gone out at the\r\nMid-day Prayer from where we were; and a dutiful letter, agreeing with\r\nwhat the spy had reported, came from Tāj Khān _Sārang-khānī_ between the\r\nAfternoon and Evening Prayers. Sl. Muḥammad gave the following\r\nparticulars:—that the rebels on reaching Chunār seemed to have laid\r\nsiege to it and to have done a little fighting, but had risen in\r\ndisorderly fashion when they heard of our approach; that Afghāns who had\r\ncrossed the river for Benares, had turned back in like disorder; that\r\ntwo of their boats had sunk in crossing and a body of their men been\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_tt. Incidents of the eastward march resumed._)\r\n\r\n(_March 6th_) After marching at Sunday's dawn (_25th_) and doing 6\r\n_kurohs_ (12m.), Sīr-auliya,[2518] a _pargana_ of Pīāg*[2519] was\r\nreached. I went direct by boat.\r\n\r\nAīsan-tīmūr Sl. and Tūkhta-būghā Sl. had dismounted half-way, and were\r\nwaiting to see me.[2520] I, for my part, invited them into the boat.\r\nTūkhta-būghā Sl. must have wrought magic, for a bitter wind rose and\r\nrain began to fall. It became quite windy(?)[2521] on which account I\r\nate _ma`jūn_, although I had done so on the previous day. Having come to\r\nthe encamping-ground....[2522]\r\n\r\n(_March 7th_?) Next day (_Monday 26th_?) we remained on the same ground.\r\n\r\n(_March 8th_?) On Tuesday (_27th_?) we marched on.\r\n\r\nOpposite the camp was what may be an island,[2523] large and verdant. I\r\nwent over by boat to visit it, returning to the boat during the 1st\r\nwatch (6-9 a.m.). While I rode carelessly along the ravine (_jar_) of\r\nthe river, my horse got to where it was fissured and had begun to give\r\nway. I leapt off at once and flung myself on the bank; even the horse\r\ndid not go down; probably, however, if I had stayed on its back, it and\r\nI would have gone down together.\r\n\r\nOn this same day, I swam the Gang-river (Ganges), counting every\r\nstroke;[2524] I crossed with 33, then, without resting, swam back. I had\r\nswum the other rivers, Gang had remained to do.[2525]\r\n\r\nWe reached the meeting of the waters of Gang and Jūn at the Evening\r\nPrayer, had the boat drawn to the Pīāg side, and got to camp at 1 watch,\r\n4 _garīs_ (10.30 p.m.).\r\n\r\n(_March 9th_) On Wednesday (_Jumāda II. 28th_) from the 1st watch\r\nonwards, the army began to cross the river Jūn; there were 420\r\nboats.[2526]\r\n\r\n(_March 11th_) On Friday, the 1st of the month of Rajab, I crossed the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n(_March 14th_) On Monday, the 4th of the month, the march for Bihār\r\nbegan along the bank of Jūn. After 5 _kurohs_ (10m.) done, halt was made\r\nat Lawāīn.[2527] I went by boat. The people of the army were crossing\r\nthe Jūn up to today. They were ordered to put the culverin-carts[2528]\r\nwhich had been landed at Ādampūr, into boats again and to bring them on\r\nby water from Pīāg.\r\n\r\nOn this ground we set wrestlers to wrestle. Dost-i-yāsīn-khair gripped\r\nthe boatman Champion of Lāhor; the contest was stubborn; it was with\r\ngreat difficulty that Dost gave the throw. A head-to-foot was bestowed\r\non each.\r\n\r\n(_March 15th and 16th_) People said that ahead of us was a swampy,\r\nmuddy, evil river called Tūs.[2529] In order to examine the ford*[2530]\r\nand repair the road, we waited two days (_Tuesday Ramzān 5th and\r\nWednesday 6th_) on this ground. For the horses and camels a ford was\r\nfound higher up, but people said laden carts could not get through it\r\nbecause of its uneven, stony bottom. [Sidenote: Fol. 364.] They were\r\njust ordered to get them through.\r\n\r\n(_March 17th_) On Thursday (_7th_) we marched on. I myself went by boat\r\ndown to where the Tūs meets the Gang (Ganges), there landed, thence rode\r\nup the Tūs, and, at the Other Prayer, reached where the army had\r\nencamped after crossing the ford. Today 6 _kurohs_ (12 m.) were done.\r\n\r\n(_March 18th_) Next day (_Friday 8th_), we stayed on that ground.\r\n\r\n(_March 19th_) On Saturday (_9th_), we marched 12 _kurohs_ and got to\r\nthe bank of Gang again at Nulibā.[2531]\r\n\r\n(_March 20th_) Marching on (_Sunday 10th_), we did 6 _kurohs_ of road,\r\nand dismounted at Kintit.[2532]\r\n\r\n(_March 21st_) Marching on (_Monday 11th_), we dismounted at\r\nNānāpur.[2533] Tāj Khān _Sārang-khānī_ came from Chunār to this ground\r\nwith his two young sons, and waited on me.\r\n\r\nIn these days a dutiful letter came from Pay-master Sl. Muḥammad, saying\r\nthat my family and train were understood to be really on their way from\r\nKābul.[2534]\r\n\r\n(_March 23rd_) On Wednesday (_13th_) we marched from that ground. I\r\nvisited the fort of Chunār, and dismounted about one _kuroh_ beyond it.\r\n\r\nDuring the days we were marching from Pīāg, painful boils had come out\r\non my body. While we were on this ground, an Ottoman Turk (Rūmī) used a\r\nremedy which had been recently discovered in Rūm. He boiled pepper in a\r\npipkin; I held the sores in the steam and, after steaming ceased, laved\r\nthem with the hot water. The treatment lasted 2 sidereal hours.\r\n\r\nWhile we were on this ground, a person said he had seen tiger and\r\nrhinoceros on an _ārāl_[2535] by the side of the camp.\r\n\r\n(_March 24th_?) In the morning (_14th_?), we made the\r\nhunting-circle[2536] [Sidenote: Fol. 364b.] on that _ārāl_, elephants\r\nalso being brought. Neither tiger nor rhino appeared; one wild buffalo\r\ncame out at the end of the line. A bitter wind rising and the whirling\r\ndust being very troublesome, I went back to the boat and in it to the\r\ncamp which was 2 _kurohs_ (4m.) above Banāras.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_uu. News of the Afghāns._)\r\n\r\n(_March 25th_ (?) _and 26th_) Having heard there were many elephants in\r\nthe Chunār jungles, I had left (Thursday's) ground thinking to hunt\r\nthem, but Tāj Khān bringing the news (_Friday 15th_(?)) that Maḥmūd Khān\r\n(_Lūdi_) was near the Son-water, I summoned the begs and took counsel as\r\nto whether to fall upon him suddenly. In the end it was settled to march\r\non continuously, fast[2537] and far.\r\n\r\n(_March 27th_) Marching on (_Sunday 17th_), we did 9 _kurohs_ (18m.),\r\nand dismounted at the Bilwah-ferry.[2538]\r\n\r\n(_March 28th_) On Monday night[2539] the 18th of the month, T̤āhir was\r\nstarted for Āgra from this camp (Bilwah-ferry), taking money-drafts for\r\nthe customary gifts of allowance and lodging[2540] to those on their way\r\nfrom Kābul.\r\n\r\nBefore dawn next morning (Monday) I went on by boat. When we came to\r\nwhere the Gūī-water (Gūmtī) which is the water of Jūnpūr, meets the\r\nGang-water (Ganges), I went a little [Sidenote: Fol. 365.] way up it and\r\nback. Narrower[2541] though it is, it has no ford; the army-folk crossed\r\nit (last year) by boat, by raft, or by swimming their horses.\r\n\r\nTo look at our ground of a year ago,[2542] from which we had started for\r\nJūnpūr,[2543] I went to about a _kuroh_ lower than the mouth of the\r\nJūnpūr-water (Gūmtī). A favourable wind getting up behind, our larger\r\nboat was tied to a smaller Bengalī one which, spreading its sail, made\r\nvery quick going. Two _garīs_ of day remained (5.15 p.m.) when we had\r\nreached that ground (Sayyidpur?), we went on without waiting there, and\r\nby the Bed-time Prayer had got to camp, which was a _kuroh_ above\r\nMadan-Benāres,[2544] long before the boats following us. Mughūl Beg had\r\nbeen ordered to measure all marches from Chunār on the direct road,\r\nLuṯfī Beg to measure the river's bank whenever I went by boat. The\r\ndirect road today was said to be 11 _kurohs_ (22m.), the distance along\r\nthe river, 18 (36m.).\r\n\r\n(_March 29th_) Next day (_Tuesday 19th_), we stayed on that ground.\r\n\r\n(_March 30th_) On Wednesday (_20th_), we dismounted a _kuroh_ (2m.)\r\nbelow Ghāzīpūr, I going by boat.\r\n\r\n(_March 31st_) On Thursday (_21st_) Maḥmūd Khān _Nuḥānī_[2545] waited\r\non me on that ground. On this same day dutiful letters[2546] came\r\nfrom Bihār Khān _Bihārī's_ son Jalāl Khān (_Nuḥānī_),[2547] from\r\nNaṣīr Khān (_Nūḥānī_)'s son Farīd Khān,[2548] from Sher Khān _Sūr_,\r\nfrom `Alāūl Khān _Sūr_ also, and from other Afghān amīrs. Today\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 365b.] came also a dutiful letter from `Abdu'l-`azīz\r\n_Master-of-the-horse_, which had been written in Lāhor on the 20th of\r\nthe latter Jumāda (_Feb. 29th_), the very day on which Qarācha's\r\nHindūstānī servant whom we had started off from near Kālpī,[2549]\r\nreached Lāhor. `Abdu'l-`azīz wrote that he had gone with the others\r\nassigned to meet my family at Nīl-āb, had met them there on the 9th of\r\nthe latter Jumāda (_Feb. 18th_), had accompanied them to Chīn-āb\r\n(Chan-āb), left them there, and come ahead to Lāhor where he was writing\r\nhis letter.\r\n\r\n(_April 1st_) We moved on, I going by boat, on Friday (_Rajab 22nd_). I\r\nlanded opposite Chausā to look at the ground of a year ago[2550] where\r\nthe Sun had been eclipsed and a fast kept.[2551] After I got back to the\r\nboat, Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā, coming up behind by boat, overtook me; at\r\nhis suggestion _ma`jūn_ was eaten.\r\n\r\nThe army had dismounted on the bank of the Karmā-nā['s]ā-river, about\r\nthe water of which Hindūs are understood to be extremely scrupulous.\r\nThey do not cross it, but go past its mouth by boat along the Gang\r\n(Ganges). They firmly believe that, if its water touch a person, the\r\nmerit of his works is destroyed; with this belief its name\r\naccords.[2552] I went some way up it by [Sidenote: Fol. 366.] boat,\r\nturned back, went over to the north bank of Gang, and tied up. There the\r\nbraves made a little fun, some wrestling. Muḥsin the cup-bearer\r\nchallenged, saying, \"I will grapple with four or five.\" The first he\r\ngripped, he threw; the second, who was Shādmān (Joyous), threw him, to\r\nMuḥsin's shame and vexation. The (professional) wrestlers came also and\r\nset to.\r\n\r\n(_April 2nd_) Next morning, Saturday (_23rd_) we moved, close to the 1st\r\nwatch (6 a.m.), in order to get people off to look at the ford through\r\nthe Karmā-nā['s]ā-water. I rode up it for not less than a _kuroh_ (2\r\nm.), but the ford being still far on,[2553] took boat and went to the\r\ncamp below Chausā.\r\n\r\nToday I used the pepper remedy again; it must have been somewhat hotter\r\nthan before, for it blistered (_qāpārdī_) my body, giving me much pain.\r\n\r\n(_April 3rd_) We waited a day for a road to be managed across a\r\nsmallish, swampy rivulet heard to be ahead.[2554]\r\n\r\n(_April 4th_) On the eve of Monday (_25th_),[2555] letters were written\r\nand sent off in answer to those brought by the Hindūstānī footman of\r\n`Abdu'l-`azīz.\r\n\r\nThe boat I got into at Monday's dawn, had to be towed because of the\r\nwind. On reaching the ground opposite Baksara (Buxar) [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n366b.] where the army had been seated many days last year,[2556] we went\r\nover to look at it. Between 40 and 50 landing-steps had been then made\r\non the bank; of them the upper two only were left, the river having\r\ndestroyed the rest. _Ma`jūn_ was eaten after return to the boat. We tied\r\nup at an _ārāl_[2557] above the camp, set the champions to wrestle, and\r\nwent on at the Bed-time Prayer. A year ago (_yīl-tūr_), an excursion had\r\nbeen made to look at the ground on which the camp now was, I passing\r\nthrough Gang swimming (? _dastak bīla_),[2558] some coming mounted on\r\nhorses, some on camels. That day I had eaten opium.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_vv. Incidents of the military operations._)\r\n\r\n(_April 5th_) At Tuesday's dawn (_26th_), we sent out for news not under\r\n200 effective braves led by Karīm-bīrdī and Ḥaidar the stirrup-holder's\r\nson Muḥammad `Alī and Bābā Shaikh.\r\n\r\nWhile we were on this ground, the Bengal envoy was commanded to set\r\nforth these three articles:—[2559]\r\n\r\n(_April 6th_) On Wednesday (_27th_) Yūnas-i-`alī who had been sent to\r\ngather Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā's objections to Bihār, brought back rather\r\na weak answer.\r\n\r\nDutiful letters from the (Farmūlī) Shaikh-zādas of Bihār gave news that\r\nthe enemy had abandoned the place and gone off.\r\n\r\n(_April 7th_) On Thursday (_28th_) as many as 2000 men of the Turk and\r\nHind amīrs and quiver-wearers were joined to Muḥammad `Alī _Jang-jang's_\r\nson Tardī-muḥammad, and he was [Sidenote: Fol. 367.] given leave to go,\r\ntaking letters of royal encouragement to people in Bihār. He was joined\r\nalso by Khwāja Murshid _`Irāqī_ who had been made Dīwān of Bihār.\r\n\r\n(_April 8th_ (?)) Muḥammad-i-zamān M. who had consented to go to Bihār,\r\nmade representation of several matters through Shaikh Zain and\r\nYūnas-i-`alī. He asked for reinforcement; for this several braves were\r\ninscribed and several others were made his own retainers.\r\n\r\n(_April 9th_)[2560] On Saturday the 1st of the month of Sha`bān, we left\r\nthat ground where we had been for 3 or 4 days. I rode to visit Bhūjpūr\r\nand Bihiya,[2561] thence went to camp.\r\n\r\nMuḥammad `Alī and the others, who had been sent out for news, after\r\nbeating a body of pagans as they went along, reached the place where Sl.\r\nMaḥmūd (_Lūdī_) had been with perhaps 2000 men. He had heard of our\r\nreconnaissance, had broken up, killed two elephants of his, and marched\r\noff. He seemed to have left braves and an elephant[2562] scout-fashion;\r\nthey made no stand when our men came up but took to flight. Ours\r\nunhorsed a few of his, cut one head off, brought in a few good men\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ww. Incidents of the eastward march resumed._)\r\n\r\n(_April 10th_) We moved on next day (_Sunday 2nd_), I going by boat.\r\nFrom our today's ground Muḥammad-i-zamān M. crossed (his army) over the\r\nriver (Son), leaving none behind. We spent 2 or 3 days on this ground in\r\norder to put his work through and [Sidenote: Fol. 367b.] get him off.\r\n\r\n(_April 13th_) On Wednesday the 4th[2563] of the month, Muḥammad-i-zamān\r\nM. was presented with a royal head-to-foot, a sword and belt, a\r\n_tīpūchāq_ horse and an umbrella.[2564] He also was made to kneel\r\n(_yūkūndūrūldī_) for the Bihār country. Of the Bihār revenues one _krūr_\r\nand 25 _laks_ were reserved for the Royal Treasury; its Dīwānī was\r\nentrusted to Murshid _`Irāqī_.\r\n\r\n(_April 14th_) I left that ground by boat on Thursday (_6th_). I had\r\nalready ordered the boats to wait, and on getting up with them, I had\r\nthem fastened together abreast in line.[2565] Though all were not\r\ncollected there, those there were greatly exceeded the breadth of the\r\nriver. They could not move on, however, so-arranged, because the water\r\nwas here shallow, there deep, here swift, there still. A crocodile\r\n(_gharīāl_) shewing itself, a terrified fish leaped so high as to fall\r\ninto a boat; it was caught and brought to me.\r\n\r\nWhen we were nearing our ground, we gave the boats names:—a [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 368.] large[2566] one, formerly the Bāburī,[2567] which had been\r\nbuilt in Āgra before the Holy-battle with Sangā, was named Asāīsh\r\n(Repose).[2568] Another, which Arāīsh Khān had built and presented to me\r\nthis year before our army got to horse, one in which I had had a\r\nplatform set up on our way to this ground, was named Arāīsh (Ornament).\r\nAnother, a good-sized one presented to me by Jalālu'd-dīn _Sharqī_, was\r\nnamed the Gunjāīsh (Capacious); in it I had ordered a second platform\r\nset up, on the top of the one already in it. To a little skiff, having a\r\n_chaukandī_,[2569] one used for every task (_har āīsh_) and duty, was\r\ngiven the name Farmāīsh (Commissioned).\r\n\r\n(_April 15th_) Next day, Friday (_7th_), no move was made.\r\nMuḥammad-i-zamān M. who, his preparations for Bihār complete, had\r\ndismounted one or two _kurohs_ from the camp, came today to take leave\r\nof me.[2570]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_xx. News of the army of Bengal._)\r\n\r\nTwo spies, returned from the Bengal army, said that Bengalīs[2571] under\r\nMakhdūm-i-`ālam were posted in 24 places on the Gandak and there raising\r\ndefences; that they had hindered the Afghāns from carrying out their\r\nintention to get their families across the river (Ganges?), and had\r\njoined them to themselves.[2572] This news making fighting probable, we\r\ndetained Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā, and sent Shāh Iskandar to Bihār with 3\r\nor 400 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_yy. Incidents of the eastward march resumed._)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 368b.] (_April 16th_) On Saturday (_8th_) a person came\r\nin from Dūdū and her son Jalāl Khān (son) of Bihār Khān[2573] whom the\r\nBengalī (Naṣrat Shāh) must have held as if eye-bewitched.[2574] After\r\nletting me know they were coming,[2575] they had done some straight\r\nfighting to get away from the Bengalīs, had crossed the river,[2576]\r\nreached Bihār, and were said now to be on their way to me.\r\n\r\nThis command was given today for the Bengal envoy Ismā`īl\r\nMītā:—Concerning those three articles, about which letters have already\r\nbeen written and despatched, let him write that an answer is long in\r\ncoming, and that if the honoured (Naṣrat Shāh) be loyal and of\r\nsingle-mind towards us, it ought to come soon.\r\n\r\n(_April 17th_) In the night of Sunday (_9th_)[2577] a man came in from\r\nTardī-muḥammad _Jang-jang_ to say that when, on Wednesday the 5th of the\r\nmonth Sha`bān, his scouts reached Bihār from this side, the Shiqdār of\r\nthe place went off by a gate on the other side.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning we marched on and dismounted in the _pargana_ of Ārī\r\n(Ārrah).[2578]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_zz. News and negotiations._)\r\n\r\nTo this ground came the news that the Kharīd[2579] army, with 100-150\r\nboats, was said to be on the far side of the Sarū near the meeting of\r\nSarū and Gang (Ghogrā and Ganges). As a sort of peace existed between us\r\nand the Bengalī (Naṣrat Shāh _Afghān_), and as, for the sake of a\r\nbenediction, peace was our first endeavour whenever such work was toward\r\nas we were now on, we kept to our rule, notwithstanding his unmannerly\r\nconduct in setting himself on our road;[2580] we associated Mullā Maẕhab\r\nwith his envoy Ismā`īl Mītā, spoke once more about those three articles\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 369.] (_faṣl soz_), and decided to let the envoy go.\r\n\r\n(_April 18th_) On Monday (_10th_) when the Bengal envoy came to wait on\r\nme, he was let know that he had his leave, and what follows was\r\nmentioned:[2581]—\"We shall be going to this side and that side, in\r\npursuit of our foe, but no hurt or harm will be done to any dependency\r\nof yours. As one of those three articles said,[2582] when you have told\r\nthe army of Kharīd to rise off our road and to go back to Kharīd, let a\r\nfew Turks be joined with it to reassure these Kharīd people and to\r\nescort them to their own place.[2583] If they quit not the ferry-head,\r\nif they cease not their unbecoming words, they must regard as their own\r\nact any ill that befalls them, must count any misfortune they confront\r\nas the fruit of their own words.\"\r\n\r\n(_April 20th_) On Wednesday (_12th_) the usual dress of honour was put\r\non the Bengal envoy, gifts were bestowed on him and his leave to go was\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n(_April 21st_) On Thursday (_13th_) Shaikh Jamālī was sent with royal\r\nletters of encouragement to Dūdū and her son Jalāl Khān.\r\n\r\nToday a servant of Māhīm's came, who will have parted from the\r\nWālī(?)[2584] on the other side of the Bāgh-i-ṣafā.\r\n\r\n(_April 23rd_) On Saturday (_15th_) an envoy from `Irāq, Murād\r\n_Qajar_[2585] the life-guardsman, was seen.\r\n\r\n(_April 24th_) On Sunday (_16th_) Mullā Maẕhab received his usual\r\nkeepsakes (_yādgārlār_) and was given leave to go.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 369b.] (_April 25th_) On Monday (_17th_) Khalīfa was\r\nsent, with several begs, to see where the river (Ganges) could be\r\ncrossed.\r\n\r\n(_April 27th_) On Wednesday, (_19th_) Khalīfa again was sent out, to\r\nlook at the ground between the two rivers (Ganges and Ghogrā).\r\n\r\nOn this same day I rode southward in the Ārī (Ārrah) _pargana_ to visit\r\nthe sheets of lotus[2586] near Ārī. During the excursion Shaikh Gūran\r\nbrought me fresh-set lotus-seeds, first-rate little things just like\r\npistachios. The flower, that is to say, the _nīlūfar_ (lotus),\r\nHindūstānīs call _kuwul-kikrī_ (lotus-pistachio), and its seed _dūdah_\r\n(soot).\r\n\r\nAs people said, \"The Son is near,\" we went to refresh ourselves on it.\r\nMasses of trees could be seen down-stream; \"Munīr is there,\" said they,\r\n\"where the tomb is of Shaikh Yaḥyā the father of Shaikh Sharafu'd-dīn\r\n_Munīrī_.\"[2587] It being so close, I crossed the Son, went 2 or 3\r\n_kurohs_ down it, traversed the Munīr orchards, made the circuit of the\r\ntomb, returned to the Son-bank, made ablution, went through the Mid-day\r\nPrayer before time, and made for camp. Some of our horses, being\r\nfat,[2588] had fallen behind; some were worn out; a few people were left\r\nto gather them together, water them, rest them, and bring them on\r\nwithout pressure; but for this many would have been ruined.\r\n\r\nWhen we turned back from Munīr, I ordered that some-one [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n370.] should count a horse's steps between the Son-bank and the camp.\r\nThey amounted to 23,100, which is 46,200 paces, which is 11-1/2\r\n_kurohs_ (23m.).[2589] It is about half a _kuroh_ from Munīr to the\r\nSon; the return journey from Munīr to the camp was therefore 12 _kurohs_\r\n(24m.). In addition to this were some 15-16 _kurohs_ done in visiting\r\nthis and that place; so that the whole excursion was one of some 30\r\n_kurohs_ (60m.). Six _garīs_ of the 1st night-watch had passed [8.15\r\np.m.] when we reached the camp.\r\n\r\n(_April 28th_) At the dawn of Thursday (_Sha`bān 19th_) Sl. Junaid\r\n_Barlās_ came in with the Jūnpūr braves from Jūnpūr. I let him know my\r\nblame and displeasure on account of his delay; I did not see him. Qāẓī\r\nJīā I sent for and saw.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_aaa. Plan of the approaching battle with the Bengal army._)\r\n\r\nOn the same day the Turk and Hind amīrs were summoned for a consultation\r\nabout crossing Gang (Ganges), and matters found settlement at\r\nthis[2590]:—that Ūstād `Alī-qulī should collect mortar, _firingī_,[2591]\r\nand culverin[2592] to the point of rising ground between the rivers Sarū\r\nand Gang, and, having many matchlockmen with him, should incite to\r\nbattle from that place;[2593] that Muṣṯafa, he also having many\r\nmatchlockmen, should get his material and implements ready on the Bihār\r\nside of Gang, a little below the meeting of the waters and opposite to\r\nwhere on an island the Bengalīs had an elephant and a mass of boats tied\r\nup, and that he should engage battle from this place;[2594] that\r\nMuḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā and the others inscribed for the work should take\r\npost behind Muṣṯafa as his reserve; that both for Ūstād `Alī-qulī and\r\nMuṣṯafa shelters (_muljār_) for the culverin-firers should be raised by\r\na mass of spadesmen and coolies (_kahār_) [Sidenote: Fol. 370b.] under\r\nappointed overseers; that as soon as these shelters were ready, `Askarī\r\nand the sulṯāns inscribed for the work should cross quickly at the\r\nHaldī-passage[2595] and come down on the enemy; that meantime, as Sl.\r\nJunaid and Qāẓī Jīā had given information about a crossing-place[2596] 8\r\n_kurohs_ (16 m.) higher up,[2597] Zard-rūī(Pale-face?) should go with a\r\nfew raftsmen and some of the people of the Sulṯān, Maḥmūd Khān _Nūḥānī_\r\nand Qāẓī Jīā to look at that crossing; and that, if crossing there were,\r\nthey should go over at once, because it was rumoured that the Bengalīs\r\nwere planning to post men at the Haldī-passage.\r\n\r\nA dutiful letter from Maḥmūd Khān the Military-collector (_shiqdār_) of\r\nSikandarpūr now came, saying that he had collected as many as 50 boats\r\nat the Haldī-passage and had given wages to the boatmen, but that these\r\nwere much alarmed at the rumoured approach of the Bengalīs.\r\n\r\n(_April 30th_) As time pressed[2598] for crossing the Sarū, I did not\r\nwait for the return of those who had gone to look at the passage, but\r\non Saturday (_21st_) summoned the begs for consultation and said, \"As it\r\nhas been reported that there are (no?) crossing-places (fords?) along\r\nthe whole of the ground from Chatur-mūk in Sikandarpūr to Barāīch and\r\nAūd,[2599] let us, while seated here, assign the large force to cross at\r\nthe Haldī-passage by boat and from there [Sidenote: Fol. 371.] to come\r\ndown on the enemy; let Ūstād `Alī-qulī and Muṣṯafa engage battle with\r\ngun (_top_), matchlock, culverin and _firingī_, and by this draw the\r\nenemy out before `Askarī comes up.[2600] Let us after crossing the river\r\n(Ganges) and assigning reinforcement to Ūstād `Alī-qulī, take our stand\r\nready for whatever comes; if `Askarī's troops get near, let us fling\r\nattack from where we are, cross over and assault; let Muḥammad-i-zamān\r\nMīrzā and those appointed to act with him, engage battle from near\r\nMuṣṯafa on the other side of Gang.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter having been left at this, the force for the north of the Gang\r\nwas formed into four divisions to start under `Askarī's command for the\r\nHaldī-passage. One division was of `Askarī and his retainers; another\r\nwas Sl. Jalālu'd-dīn _Sharqī_; another was of the Aūzbeg sulṯāns\r\nQāsim-i-ḥusain Sulṯān, Bī-khūb Sulṯān and Tāng-aītmīsh Sulṯān, together\r\nwith Maḥmūd Khān _Nūḥānī_ of Ghāzīpūr, Bābā Qashqa's Kūkī, Tūlmīsh\r\n_Aūzbeg_, Qurbān of Chīrkh, and the Daryā-khānīs led by Ḥasan Khān;\r\nanother was of Mūsā Sl. (_Farmūlī_) and Sl. Junaid with what-not of the\r\nJūnpūr army, some 20,000 men. Officers were appointed to oversee the\r\ngetting of the force to horse that very night, that is to say, the\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 371b.] night of Sunday.[2601]\r\n\r\n(_May 1st_) The army began to cross Gang at the dawn of Sunday (_Sha`bān\r\n22nd_); I went over by boat at the 1st watch (6a.m.). Zard-rūī and his\r\nparty came in at mid-day; the ford itself they had not found but they\r\nbrought news of boats and of having met on the road the army getting\r\nnear them.[2602]\r\n\r\n(_May 3rd_) On Tuesday (_Sha`bān 24th_) we marched from where the river\r\nhad been crossed, went on for nearly one _kuroh_ (2 m.) and dismounted\r\non the fighting-ground at the confluence.[2603] I myself went to enjoy\r\nŪstād `Alī-qulī's firing of culverin and _firingī_; he hit two boats\r\ntoday with _firingī_-stones, broke them and sank them. Muṣṯafa did the\r\nsame from his side. I had the large mortar[2604] taken to the\r\nfighting-ground, left Mullā Ghulām to superintend the making of its\r\nposition, appointed a body of _vasāwals_[2605] and active braves to help\r\nhim, went to an island facing the camp and there ate _ma`jūn_.\r\n\r\nWhilst still under the influence of the confection[2606] I had the boat\r\ntaken to near the tents and there slept. A strange thing happened in the\r\nnight, a noise and disturbance arising about the 3rd watch (midnight)\r\nand the pages and others snatching up pieces of wood from the boat, and\r\nshouting \"Strike! strike!\" [Sidenote: Fol. 372.] What was said to have\r\nled to the disturbance was that a night-guard who was in the Farmāīsh\r\nalong-side the Asāīsh in which I was sleeping,[2607] opening his eyes\r\nfrom slumber, sees a man with his hand on the Asāīsh as if meaning to\r\nclimb into her. They fall on him;[2608] he dives, comes up again, cuts\r\nat the night-guard's head, wounding it a little, then runs off at once\r\ntowards the river.[2609] Once before, on the night we returned from\r\nMunīr, one or two night-guards had chased several Hindūstānīs from near\r\nthe boats, and had brought in two swords and a dagger of theirs. The\r\nMost High had me in His Keeping!\r\n\r\n   (_Persian_) Were the sword of the world to leap forth,\r\n               It would cut not a vein till God will.[2610]\r\n\r\n(_May 4th_) At the dawn of Wednesday (_25th_), I went in the boat\r\nGunjāīsh to near the stone-firing ground (_tāsh-ātār-yīr_) and there\r\nposted each soever to his work.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_bbb. Details of the engagement._)\r\n\r\nAūghān-bīrdī _Mughūl_, leading not less than 1,000 men, had been sent to\r\nget, in some way or other, across the river (Sarū) one, two, three\r\n_kurohs_ (2, 4, 6m.) higher up. A mass of foot-soldiers, crossing from\r\nopposite `Askarī's camp,[2611] landed from 20-30 boats on his road,\r\npresumably thinking to show their superiority, but Aūghān-bīrdī and his\r\nmen charged them, put them to flight, took a few and cut their heads\r\noff, shot many with arrows, and got possession of 7 or 8 boats. Today\r\nalso Bengalīs crossed in a few boats to Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā's side,\r\nthere landed and [Sidenote: Fol. 372b.] provoked to fight. When attacked\r\nthey fled, and three boat-loads of them were drowned. One boat was\r\ncaptured and brought to me. In this affair Bābā the Brave went forward\r\nand exerted himself excellently.\r\n\r\nOrders were given that in the darkness of night the boats Aūghān-bīrdī\r\nhad captured should be drawn[2612] up-stream, and that in them there\r\nshould cross Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā, Yakka Khwāja, Yūnas-i-`alī,\r\nAūghān-bīrdī and those previously assigned to go with them.\r\n\r\nToday came a man from `Askarī to say that he had crossed the\r\n[Sarū]-water, leaving none behind, and that he would come down on the\r\nenemy at next day's dawn, that is to say, on Thursday's. Here-upon those\r\nalready ordered to cross over were told to join `Askarī and to advance\r\nupon the enemy with him.\r\n\r\nAt the Mid-day Prayer a person came from Ūstā, saying \"The stone is\r\nready; what is the order?\" The order was, \"Fire this stone off; keep the\r\nnext till I come.\" Going at the Other Prayer in a very small Bengalī\r\nskiff to where shelter (_muljār_) had been raised, I saw Ūstā fire off\r\none large stone and several small _firingī_ ones. Bengalīs have a\r\nreputation for fire-working;[2613] we tested it now; they do not fire\r\ncounting to hit a particular spot, but fire at random.\r\n\r\nAt this same Other Prayer orders were given to draw a few boats\r\nup-stream along the enemy's front. A few were got past without a \"God\r\nforbid!\"[2614] from those who, all unprotected, drew [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n373.] them up. Aīsān-tīmūr Sl. and Tūkhta-būghā Sl. were ordered to stay\r\nat the place those boats reached, and to keep watch over them. I got\r\nback to camp in the 1st night-watch of Thursday.[2615]\r\n\r\nNear midnight came news from (Aūghān-bīrdī's) boats which were being\r\ndrawn up-stream, \"The force appointed had gone somewhat ahead; we were\r\nfollowing, drawing the boats, when the Bengalīs got to know where we\r\nwere drawing them and attacked. A stone hit a boatman in the leg and\r\nbroke it, we could not pass on.\"\r\n\r\n(_May 5th_) At dawn on Thursday (_Sha`bān 26th_) came the news from\r\nthose at the shelter, \"All the boats have come from above.[2616] The\r\nenemy's horse has ridden to meet our approaching army.\" On this, I got\r\nour men mounted quickly and rode out to above those boats[2617] that had\r\nbeen drawn up in the night. A galloper was sent off with an order for\r\nMuḥammad Sl. M. and those appointed to cross with him, to do it at once\r\nand join `Askarī. The order for Aīsān-tīmūr Sl. and Tūkhta-būghā Sl. who\r\nwere above these boats,[2618] was that they should busy themselves to\r\ncross. Bābā Sl. was not at his post.[2619]\r\n\r\nAīsān-tīmūr Sl. at once crosses, in one boat with 30-40 of his retainers\r\nwho hold their horses by the mane at the boat-side. [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n373b.] A second boat follows. The Bengalīs see them crossing and start\r\noff a mass of foot-soldiers for them. To meet these go 7 or 8 of\r\nAīsān-tīmūr Sl.'s retainers, keeping together, shooting off arrows,\r\ndrawing those foot-soldiers towards the Sulṯān who meantime is getting\r\nhis men mounted; meantime also the second boat is moving (_rawān_). When\r\nhis 30-35 horsemen charge those foot-soldiers, they put them well to\r\nflight. Aīsān-tīmūr did distinguished work, first in crossing before the\r\nrest, swift, steady, and without a \"God forbid!\", secondly in his\r\nexcellent advance, with so few men, on such a mass of foot, and by\r\nputting these to flight. Tūkhta-būghā Sl. also crossed. Then boats\r\nfollowed one after another. Lāhorīs and Hindūstānīs began to cross from\r\ntheir usual posts[2620] by swimming or on bundles of reeds.[2621] Seeing\r\nhow matters were going, the Bengalīs of the boats opposite the shelter\r\n(Muṣṯafa's), set their faces for flight down-stream.\r\n\r\nDarwīsh-i-muḥammad _Sārbān_, Dost Lord-of-the-gate, Nūr Beg and several\r\nbraves also went across the river. I made a man gallop off to the\r\nSulṯāns to say, \"Gather well together those who [Sidenote: Fol. 374.]\r\ncross, go close to the opposing army, take it in the flank, and get to\r\ngrips.\" Accordingly the Sulṯāns collected those who crossed, formed up\r\ninto 3 or 4 divisions, and started for the foe. As they draw near, the\r\nenemy-commander, without breaking his array, flings his foot-soldiers to\r\nthe front and so comes on. Kūkī comes up with a troop from `Askarī's\r\nforce and gets to grips on his side; the Sulṯāns get to grips on theirs;\r\nthey get the upper hand, unhorse man after man, and make the enemy\r\nscurry off. Kūkī's men bring down a Pagan of repute named Basant Rāō\r\nand cut off his head; 10 or 15 of his people fall on Kūkī's, and are\r\ninstantly cut to pieces. Tūkhta-būghā Sl. gallops along the enemy's\r\nfront and gets his sword well in. Mughūl `Abdu'l-wahhāb and his younger\r\nbrother gets theirs in well too. Mughūl though he did not know how to\r\nswim, had crossed the river holding to his horse's mane.\r\n\r\nI sent for my own boats which were behind;[2622] the Farmāīsh coming up\r\nfirst, I went over in it to visit the Bengalīs' encamping-grounds. I\r\nthen went into the Gunjāīsh. \"Is there a crossing-place higher up?\" I\r\nasked. Mīr Muḥammad the raftsman represented that the Sarū was better to\r\ncross higher up;[2623] accordingly the army-folk[2624] were ordered to\r\ncross at the higher place he named.\r\n\r\nWhile those led by Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā were crossing the [Sidenote: Fol.\r\n374b.] river,[2625] the boat in which Yakka Khwāja was, sank and he went\r\nto God's mercy. His retainers and lands were bestowed on his younger\r\nbrother Qāsim Khwāja.\r\n\r\nThe Sulṯāns arrived while I was making ablution for the Mid-day Prayer;\r\nI praised and thanked them and led them to expect guerdon and kindness.\r\n`Askarī also came; this was the first affair he had seen; one\r\nwell-omened for him!\r\n\r\nAs the camp had not yet crossed the river, I took my rest in the boat\r\nGunjāīsh, near an island.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ccc. Various incidents of the days following the battle._)\r\n\r\n(_May 6th_) During the day of Friday (_Sha`bān 27th_) we landed at a\r\nvillage named Kūndīh[2626] in the Nirhun _pargana_ of Kharīd on the\r\nnorth side of the Sarū.[2627]\r\n\r\n(_May 8th_) On Sunday (_29th_) Kūkī was sent to Ḥājīpūr for news.\r\n\r\nShāh Muḥammad (son) of Ma`rūf to whom in last year's campaign (934 AH.)\r\nI had shown great favour and had given the Sāran-country, had done well\r\non several occasions, twice fighting and overcoming his father\r\nMa`rūf.[2628] At the time when Sl. Maḥmūd _Lūdī_ perfidiously took\r\npossession of Bihār and was opposed by Shaikh Bāyazīd and Bīban, Shāh\r\nMuḥammad had no help for it, he had to join them; but even then, when\r\npeople were saying wild words about him, he had written dutifully to me.\r\nWhen `Askarī crossed at the Haldī-passage, Shāh [Sidenote: Fol. 375.]\r\nMuḥammad had come at once with a troop, seen him and with him gone\r\nagainst the Bengalīs. He now came to this ground and waited on me.\r\n\r\nDuring these days news came repeatedly that Bīban and Shaikh Bāyazīd\r\nwere meaning to cross the Sarū-river.\r\n\r\nIn these days of respite came the surprising news from Sanbal (Saṃbhal)\r\nwhere `Alī-i-yūsuf had stayed in order to bring the place into some sort\r\nof order, that he and a physician who was by way of being a friend of\r\nhis, had gone to God's mercy on one and the same day. `Abdu'l-lāh\r\n(_kitābdār_) was ordered to go and maintain order in Sanbal.\r\n\r\n(_May 13th_) On Friday the 5th of the month Ramẓān, `Abdu'l-lāh was\r\ngiven leave for Sanbal.[2629]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ddd. News from the westward._)\r\n\r\nIn these same days came a dutiful letter from Chīn-tīmūr Sl. saying that\r\non account of the journey of the family from Kābul, several of the begs\r\nwho had been appointed to reinforce him, had not been able to join\r\nhim;[2630] also that he had gone out with Muḥammadī and other begs and\r\nbraves, not less than 100 _kurohs_ (200m.), attacked the Balūchīs and\r\ngiven them a good beating.[2631] Orders were sent through `Abdu'l-lāh\r\n(_kitābdār_) for the Sulṯān that he and Sl. Muḥammad _Dūldāī_,\r\nMuḥammadī, and some of the begs and braves of that country-side should\r\nassemble in Āgra and there remain ready to move to wherever an enemy\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_eee. Settlement with the Nūḥānī Afghāns._)\r\n\r\n(_May 16th_) On Monday the 8th of the month, Daryā Khān's [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 375b.] grandson Jalāl Khān to whom Shaikh Jamālī had gone, came in\r\nwith his chief amīrs and waited on me.[2632] Yaḥyā _Nūḥānī_ also came,\r\nwho had already sent his younger brother in sign of submission and had\r\nreceived a royal letter accepting his service. Not to make vain the hope\r\nwith which some 7 or 8,000 _Nūḥānī_ Afghāns had come in to me, I\r\nbestowed 50 _laks_ from Bīhār on Maḥmūd Khān _Nūḥānī_, after reserving\r\none _krūr_ for Government uses (_khalṣa_), and gave the remainder of the\r\nBihār revenues in trust for the above-mentioned Jalāl Khān who for his\r\npart agreed to pay one _krūr_ of tribute. Mullā Ghulām _yasāwal_ was\r\nsent to collect this tribute.[2633] Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā received the\r\nJūnapūr-country.[2634]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_fff.

As the object of this campaign\r\nwas to put down the rebel Afghāns of whom some had taken their heads\r\nand gone off, some had come in submissive and accepting my service, and\r\nthe remaining few were in the hands of the Bengalī [Sidenote: Fol. 376.]\r\n(Naṣrat Shāh) who had taken them in charge, and as, moreover, the Rains\r\nwere near, we in our turn wrote and despatched words for peace on the\r\nconditions mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ggg_. _Submissions and guerdon._)\r\n\r\n(_May 21st_) On Saturday (_13th_) Ismā`īl _Jālwānī_, `Alāūl Khān\r\n_Nūḥānī_, Auliya Khān _Ashrāqī_(?) and 5 and 6 amīrs came in and waited\r\non me.\r\n\r\nToday guerdon was bestowed on Aīsān-tīmūr Sl. and Tūkhta-būghā Sl., of\r\nswords and daggers with belts, cuirasses, dresses of honour, and\r\n_tīpūchāq_ horses; also they were made to kneel, Aīsān-tīmūr Sl. for the\r\ngrant of 36 _laks_ from the Nārnūl _pargana_, Tūkhta-bughā Sl. for 30\r\n_laks_ from that of Shamsābād.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_hhh_. _Pursuit of Bāyazīd and Bīban._)\r\n\r\n(_May 23rd_) On Monday the 15th of the month (_Ramẓān_), we marched from\r\nour ground belonging to Kūndbah (or Kūndīh) on the Sarū-river, with easy\r\nmind about Bihār and Bengal, and resolute to crush the traitors Bīban\r\nand Shaikh Bāyazīd.\r\n\r\n(_May 25th_) On Wednesday (_17th_) after making two night-halts by the\r\nway, we dismounted at a passage across the Sarū, called\r\nChaupāra-Chaturmūk of Sikandarpūr.[2636] From today people were busy in\r\ncrossing the river.\r\n\r\nAs news began to come again and again that the traitors, after crossing\r\nSarū and Gogar,[2637] were going toward Luknū,[2638] the following\r\nleaders were appointed to bar (their) crossing[2639]:—The Turk and Hind\r\namīrs Jalālu'd-dīn _Sharqī_, `Alī Khān _Farmūlī_; Tardīka (or, Tardī\r\n_yakka_), Nizām Khān of Bīāna, together with Tūlmīsh _Aūzbeg_, Qurbān of\r\nChīrk and Daryā Khān (of Bhīra's [Sidenote: Fol. 376b.] son) Ḥasan Khān.\r\nThey were given leave to go on the night of Thursday.[2640]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_iii.

I was in\r\nthe Audience-tent, about to write (_kitābat qīlā dūr aīdīm_); before I\r\ncould collect papers and sections,[2642] the tent came down, with its\r\nporch, right on my head. The _tūnglūq_ went to pieces.[2643] God\r\npreserved me! no harm befell me! Sections and book[2644] were drenched\r\nunder water and gathered together with much difficulty. We laid them in\r\nthe folds of a woollen throne-carpet,[2645] put this on the throne and\r\non it piled blankets. The storm quieted down in about 2 _garīs_ (45m.);\r\nthe bedding-tent was set up, a lamp lighted, and, after much trouble, a\r\nfire kindled. We, without sleep, were busy till shoot of day drying\r\nfolios and sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_jjj.

As had been done last year (934 AH.), an\r\nallowance from Sāran and Kūndla[2649] was bestowed on him for the\r\nmaintenance of quiver-wearers. Today too an allowance of 72 _laks_[2650]\r\nfrom Sarwār and a _tīpūchāq_ horse were bestowed on Ismā`īl _Jalwānī_,\r\nand his leave was given.\r\n\r\nAbout the boats Gunjāīsh and Arāīsh it was settled with Bengalīs that\r\nthey should take them to Ghāzīpūr by way of Tīr-mūhānī.[2651] The boats\r\nAsāīsh and Farmāīsh were ordered taken up the Sarū with the camp.\r\n\r\n(_May 30th_) On Monday (_Ramẓān 22nd_) we marched from the\r\nChaupāra-Chaturmūk passage along the Sarū, with mind at ease about Bihār\r\nand Sarwār,[2652] and after doing as much as 10 _kurohs_\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 377b.] (20m.) dismounted on the Sarū in a village\r\ncalled Kilirah (?) dependent on Fatḥpūr.[2653]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_kkk.

We marched at dawn; I got into the Asāīsh\r\nhalf-way and had it towed to our ground higher up.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_mmm. Details of the capture of a fort by Bīban and Bāyazīd._)\r\n\r\nOn the way up, Khalīfa brought Shāh Muḥammad _dīwāna's_ son who had come\r\nfrom Bāqī bringing this reliable news about Luknūr[2657]:—They (_i.e._\r\nBīban and Bāyazīd) hurled their assault on Saturday the 13th of the\r\nmonth Ramẓān (_May 21st_) but could do nothing by fighting; while the\r\nfighting was going on, a collection of wood-chips, hay, and thorns in\r\nthe fort took fire, so that inside the walls it became as hot as an oven\r\n(_tanūrdīk tafsān_); the garrison could not move round the rampart; the\r\nfort was lost. When the enemy heard, two or three days later, of our\r\nreturn (westwards), he fled towards Dalmau.[2658]\r\n\r\nToday after doing as much as 10 _kurohs_ (20m.), we dismounted beside a\r\nvillage called Jalisir,[2659] on the Sarū-bank, in the Sagrī _pargāna_.\r\n\r\n(_June 1st_) We stayed on the same ground through Wednesday (_24th_), in\r\norder to rest our cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_nnn.

I like others took fish in my hands.[2662]\r\n\r\n(_June 3rd_) On Friday (_26th_) we dismounted on a very slender stream,\r\nthe head-water of a branch of the Parsarū. In order not to be disturbed\r\nby the comings and goings of the army-folk, [Sidenote: Fol. 378b.] I had\r\nit dammed higher up and had a place, 10 by 10, made for ablution. The\r\nnight of the 27th[2663] was spent on this ground.\r\n\r\n(_June 4th_) At the dawn of the same day (_Saturday 27th_) we left that\r\nwater, crossed the Tūs and dismounted on its bank.[2664]\r\n\r\n(_June 5th_) On Sunday (_28th_) we dismounted on the bank of the same\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n(_June 6th_) On Monday the 29th of the month (_Ramẓān_), our station was\r\non the bank of the same Tūs-water. Though tonight the sky was not quite\r\nclear, a few people saw the Moon, and so testifying to the Qāẓī, fixed\r\nthe end of the month (_Ramẓān_).\r\n\r\n(_June 7th_) On Tuesday (_Shawwāl 1st_) we made the Prayer of the\r\nFestival, at dawn rode on, did 10 _kurohs_ (20 m.), and dismounted on\r\nthe bank of the Gūī (Gūmtī), a _kuroh_ (2 m.) from Māīng.[2665] The sin\r\nof _ma`jūn_ was committed (_irtikāb qīlīldī_) near the Mid-day Prayer; I\r\nhad sent this little couplet of invitation to Shaikh Zain, Mullā Shihāb\r\nand Khwānd-amīr:—\r\n\r\n   (_Turkī_) Shaikh and Mullā Shihāb and Khwānd-amir,\r\n             Come all three, or two, or one.\r\n\r\nDarwīsh-i-muḥammad (_Sārbān_), Yūnas-i-`alī and `Abdu'l-lāh\r\n(_`asas_)[2666] were also there. At the Other Prayer the wrestlers set\r\nto.\r\n\r\n(_June 8th_) On Wednesday (_2nd_) we stayed on the same ground. Near\r\nbreakfast-time _ma`jūn_ was eaten. Today Malik Sharq came in who had\r\nbeen to get Tāj Khān out of Chunār.[2667] When the wrestlers set to\r\ntoday, the Champion of Aūd who had come earlier, grappled with and threw\r\na Hindūstānī wrestler who had [Sidenote: Fol. 379.] come in the\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\nToday Yaḥyā _Nuḥāni_ was granted an allowance of 15 _laks_ from\r\nParsarūr,[2668] made to put on a dress of honour, and given his leave.\r\n\r\n(_June 9th_) Next day (_Thursday 3rd_) we did 11 _kurohs_ (22 m.),\r\ncrossed the Gūī-water (Gūmtī), and dismounted on its bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ppp. Concerning the pursuit of Bīban and Bāyazīd._)\r\n\r\nNews came in about the sulṯāns and begs of the advance that they had\r\nreached Dalmūd (Dalmau), but were said not yet to have crossed the water\r\n(Ganges). Angered by this (delay), I sent orders, \"Cross the water at\r\nonce; follow the track of the rebels; cross Jūn (Jumna) also; join `Ālam\r\nKhān to yourselves; be energetic and get to grips with the adversary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(_qqq.

While the camp was being got\r\nover, _ma`jūn_ was eaten on an island (_ārāl_) below the ford.\r\n\r\n(_June 13th_) After crossing, we waited one day (_Monday 7th_) for all\r\nthe army-folk to get across. Today Bāqī _Tāshkīndī_ came in with the\r\narmy of Aūd (Ajodhya) and waited on me.\r\n\r\n(_June 14th_) Leaving the Gang-water (Ganges, _Tuesday 8th_), we made\r\none night-halt, then dismounted (_June 15th-Shawwāl 9th_) beside Kūrarah\r\n(Kūra Khāṣ) on the Arind-water. The distance from Dalmūd (Dalmau) to\r\nKūrarah came out at 22 _kurohs_ (44 m.).[2669]\r\n\r\n(_June 16th_) On Thursday (_10th_) we marched early from that ground and\r\ndismounted opposite the Ādampūr _pargana_.[2670]\r\n\r\nTo enable us to cross (Jūn) in pursuit of our adversaries, a few\r\n[Sidenote: Fol. 379b.] raftsmen had been sent forward to collect at\r\nKālpī what boats were to be had; some boats arrived the night we\r\ndismounted, moreover a ford was found through the Jūn-river.\r\n\r\nAs the encamping-place was full of dust, we settled ourselves on an\r\nisland and there stayed the several days we were on that ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_rrr. Concerning Bīban and Bāyazīd._)\r\n\r\nNot getting reliable news about the enemy, we sent Bāqī _shaghāwal_ with\r\na few braves of the interior[2671] to get information about him.\r\n\r\n(_June 17th_) Next day (_Friday 11th_) at the Other Prayer, one of Bāqī\r\nBeg's retainers came in. Bāqī had beaten scouts of Bīban and Bāyazīd,\r\nkilled one of their good men, Mubārak Khān _Jalwānī_, and some others,\r\nsent in several heads, and one man alive.\r\n\r\n(_June 18th_) At dawn (_Saturday 12th_) Paymaster Shāh Ḥusain came in,\r\ntold the story of the beating of the scouts, and gave various news.\r\n\r\nTonight, that is to say, the night of Sunday the 13th of the\r\nmonth,[2672] the river Jūn came down in flood, so that by the dawn, the\r\nwhole of the island on which I was settled, was under water. I moved to\r\nanother an arrow's-flight down-stream, there had a tent set up and\r\nsettled down.\r\n\r\n(_June 20th_) On Monday (_14th_) Jalāl _Tāshkīndī_ came from the begs\r\nand sulṯāns of the advance. Shaikh Bāyazīd and Bīban, on hearing of\r\ntheir expedition, had fled to the _pargana_ of Mahūba.[2673] [Sidenote:\r\nFol. 380.]\r\n\r\nAs the Rains had set in and as after 5 or 6 months of active service,\r\nhorses and cattle in the army were worn out, the sulṯāns and begs of the\r\nexpedition were ordered to remain where they were till they received\r\nfresh supplies from Āgra and those parts. At the Other Prayer of the\r\nsame day, leave was given to Bāqī and the army of Aūd (Ajodhya). Also an\r\nallowance of 30 _lāks_[2674] from Amrohā was assigned to Mūsa (son) of\r\nMa`rūf _Farmūlī_, who had waited on me at the time the returning army\r\nwas crossing the Sarū-water,[2675] a special head-to-foot and saddled\r\nhorse were bestowed on him, and he was given his leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_sss.

Towards the Mid-day Prayer, having\r\ncrossed Jūn, I waited on Khwāja `Abdu'l-ḥaqq, went into the Fort and saw\r\nthe begīms my paternal-aunts.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_ttt.

To have\r\ngrapes and melons grown in this way in Hindūstān filled my measure of\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_uuu.

On account of these matters\r\nQaṃbar-i-`alī _Arghūn_ was started off on Sunday the 11th of the month\r\n(_Ẕū'l-qa`da_), to arrest Shaikh Sharaf, the Lāhor _imāms_ with their\r\nassociates, and `Abdu'l-`azīz, and to bring them all to Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_xxx.

He went;\r\nand in a few days came back bringing Raḥīm-dād's son, but, though the\r\nson came, Raḥīm-dād himself had no thought of coming. On Wednesday the\r\n5th of _Ẕū'l-ḥijja_, Nūr Beg was sent to Gūālīār to allay Raḥīm-dād's\r\nfears, came back in a few days, and laid requests from Raḥīm-dād before\r\nus. Orders in accordance with those requests had been written and were\r\non the point of despatch when one of Raḥīm-dād's servants arriving,\r\nrepresented that he had come to effect the escape of the son and that\r\nRaḥīm-dād himself had no thought of coming in. I was for riding out at\r\nonce to Gūālīār, but Khalīfa set it forth to me, \"Let me write one more\r\nletter commingled with good counsel; he may even yet come peacefully.\"\r\nOn this mission Khusrau's (son?)

(Sept. 7th 1529 AD.) and down to the date of his\r\ndeath on Jumāda 1. 6th 937 AH. (Dec. 26th 153O AD.). The known original\r\nsources are few, their historical matter scant, their contents mainly\r\nbiographical. Gleanings may yet be made, however, in unexpected places,\r\nsuch gleanings as are provided by Aḥmad-i-yādgār's interpolation of\r\nTīmūrid history amongst his lives of Afghān Sulṯāns.\r\n\r\nThe earliest original source which helps to fill the gap of 936 AH. is\r\nḤaidar Mīrzā's _Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_, finished as to its Second Part which\r\ncontains Bābur's biography, in 948 AH. (1541 AD.), 12 years therefore\r\nafter the year of the gap 936 AH. It gives valuable information about\r\nthe affairs of Badakhshān, based on its author's personal experience at\r\n30 years of age, and was Abū'l-faẓl's authority for the _Akbar-nāma_.\r\n\r\nThe next in date of the original sources is Gul-badan Begīm's\r\n_Humāyūn-nāma_, a chronicle of family affairs, which she wrote in\r\nobedience to her nephew Akbar's command, given in about 995 AH. (1587\r\nAD.), some 57 years after her Father's death, that whatever any person\r\nknew of his father (Humāyūn) and grandfather (Bābur) should be written\r\ndown for Abū'l-faẓl's use. It embodies family memories and traditions,\r\nand presumably gives the recollections of several ladies of the royal\r\ncircle.[2693]\r\n\r\nThe _Akbar-nāma_ derives much of its narrative for 936-937 AH. from\r\nḤaidar Mīrzā and Gul-badan Begīm, but its accounts of Bābur's\r\nself-surrender and of his dying address to his chiefs presuppose the\r\nhelp of information from a contemporary witness. It is noticeable that\r\nthe _Akbar-nāma_ records no public events as occurring in Hindūstān\r\nduring 936-937 AH., nothing of the sequel of rebellion by\r\nRaḥīm-dād[2694] and `Abdu'l-`azīz, nothing of the untiring Bīban and\r\nBāyazīd. That something could have been told is shown by what\r\nAḥmad-i-yādgār has preserved (_vide post_); but 50 years had passed\r\nsince Bābur's death and, manifestly, interest in filling the _lacunæ_ in\r\nhis diary was then less keen than it is over 300 years later. What in\r\nthe _Akbar-nāma_ concerns Bābur is likely to have been written somewhat\r\nearly in the _cir._ 15 years of its author's labours on it,[2695] but,\r\neven so, the elder women of the royal circle had had rest after the\r\nmiseries Humāyūn had wrought, the forgiveness of family affection would\r\nveil his past, and certainly has provided Abū'l-faẓl with an\r\nover-mellowed estimate of him, one ill-assorting with what is justified\r\nby his Bābur-nāma record.\r\n\r\nThe contribution made towards filling the gap of 936-937 AH. in the body\r\nof Niẕāmu-'d-dīn Aḥmad's _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_ is limited to a curious and\r\ndoubtfully acceptable anecdote about a plan for the supersession of\r\nHumāyūn as Pādshāh, and about the part played by Khwāja Muqīm _Harāwī_\r\nin its abandonment. A further contribution is made, however, in Book VII\r\nwhich contains the history of the Muḥammadan Kings of Kashmīr, namely,\r\nthat Bābur despatched an expedition into that country. As no such\r\nexpedition is recorded or referred to in surviving Bābur-nāma writings,\r\nit is likely to have been sent in 936 AH. during Bābur's tour to and\r\nfrom Lāhor. If it were made with the aim of extending Tīmūrid authority\r\nin the Himālayan borderlands, a hint of similar policy elsewhere may be\r\ngiven by the ceremonious visit of the Rāja of Kahlūr to Bābur,\r\nmentioned by Aḥmad-i-yādgār (_vide post_).[2696] The T̤.-i-A. was\r\nwritten within the term of Abū'l-faẓl's work on the _Akbar-nāma_, being\r\nbegun later, and ended about 9 years earlier, in 1002 AH.-1593 AD. It\r\nappears to have been Abū'-l-faẓl's authority for his account of the\r\ncampaign carried on in Kashmīr by Bābur's chiefs (_Āyīn-i-akbarī_ vol.\r\nii, part i, Jarrett's trs. p. 389).\r\n\r\nAn important contribution, seeming to be authentic, is found\r\ninterpolated in Aḥmad-i-yādgār's _Tārīkh-i-salāṯīn-i-afāghana_, one\r\nwhich outlines a journey made by Bābur to Lāhor in 936 AH. and gives\r\ncircumstantial details of a punitive expedition sent by him from Sihrind\r\nat the complaint of the Qāẓī of Samāna against a certain Mundāhir\r\nRājpūt. The whole contribution dovetails into matters found elsewhere.\r\nIts precision of detail bespeaks a closely-contemporary written\r\nsource.[2697] As its fullest passage concerns the Samāna Qāẓī's affair,\r\nits basis of record may have been found in Samāna. Some considerations\r\nabout the date of Aḥmad-i-yādgār's own book and what Niamatu'l-lāh says\r\nof Haibat Khān of Samāna, his own generous helper in the\r\n_Tārīkhi-Khan-i-jahān Lūdī_, point towards Haibat Khān as providing the\r\ndetails of the Qāẓī's wrongs and avenging. The indication is\r\nstrengthened by the circumstance that what precedes and what follows the\r\naccount of the punitive expedition is outlined only.[2698]\r\nAḥmad-i-yādgār interpolates an account of Humāyūn also, which is a frank\r\nplagiarism from the _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_. He tells too a story purporting\r\nto explain why Bābur \"selected\" Humāyūn to succeed him, one parallel\r\nwith Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad's about what led Khalīfa to abandon his plan of\r\nsetting the Mīrzā aside. Its sole value lies in its testimony to a\r\nbelief, held by its first narrator whoever he was, that choice was\r\nexercised in the matter by Bābur. Reasons for thinking Niẕāmu'd-dīn's\r\nstory, as it stands, highly improbable, will be found later in this\r\nnote.\r\n\r\nMuḥammad Qāsim Hindū Shāh _Firishta's Tārīkh-i-firishta_ contains an\r\ninteresting account of Bābur but contributes towards filling the gap in\r\nthe events of 936-937 AH. little that is not in the earlier sources. In\r\nM. Jules Mohl's opinion it was under revision as late as 1623 AD.\r\n(1032-3 AH.).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a. Humāyūn and Badakhshān._)\r\n\r\nAn occurrence which had important results, was the arrival of Humāyūn in\r\nĀgra, unsummoned by his Father, from the outpost station of Badakhshān.\r\nIt will have occurred early in 936 AH. (autumn 1529 AD.), because he was\r\nin Kābul in the first ten days of the last month of 935 AH. (_vide\r\npost_). Curiously enough his half-sister Gul-badan does not mention his\r\ncoming, whether through avoidance of the topic or from inadvertence; the\r\nomission may be due however to the loss of a folio from the only known\r\nMS. of her book (that now owned by the British Museum), and this is the\r\nmore likely that Abū'l-faẓl writes, at some length, about the arrival\r\nand its motive, what the Begīm might have provided, this especially by\r\nhis attribution of filial affection as Humāyūn's reason for coming to\r\nĀgra.\r\n\r\nḤaidar Mīrzā is the authority for the Akbar-nāma account of Humāyūn's\r\ndeparture from Qila`-i-ẕafar and its political and military sequel. He\r\nexplains the departure by saying that when Bābur had subdued Hindūstān,\r\nhis sons Humāyūn and Kāmrān were grown-up; and that wishing to have one\r\nof them at hand in case of his own death, he summoned Humāyūn, leaving\r\nKāmrān in Qandahār. No doubt these were the contemporary impressions\r\nconveyed to Ḥaidar, and strengthened by the accomplished fact before he\r\nwrote some 12 years later; nevertheless there are two clear indications\r\nthat there was no royal order for Humāyūn to leave Qila`-i-ẕafar, _viz._\r\nthat no-one had been appointed to relieve him even when he reached Āgra,\r\nand that Abū'l-faẓl mentions no summons but attributes the Mīrzā's\r\ndeparture from his post to an overwhelming desire to see his Father.\r\nWhat appears probable is that Māhīm wrote to her son urging his coming\r\nto Āgra, and that this was represented as Bābur's wish. However little\r\nweight may be due to the rumour, preserved in anecdotes recorded long\r\nafter 935 AH., that any-one, Bābur or Khalīfa, inclined against\r\nHumāyūn's succession, that rumour she would set herself to falsify by\r\nreconciliation.[2699]\r\n\r\nWhen the Mīrzā's intention to leave Qila`-i-ẕafar became known there,\r\nthe chiefs represented that they should not be able to withstand the\r\nAūzbeg on their frontier without him (his troops implied).[2700] With\r\nthis he agreed, said that still he must go, and that he would send a\r\nMīrzā in his place as soon as possible. He then rode, in one day, to\r\nKābul, an item of rapid travel preserved by Abū'l-faẓl.\r\n\r\nHumāyūn's departure caused such anxiety in Qila`-i-ẕafar that some (if\r\nnot all) of the Badakhshī chiefs hurried off an invitation to Sa`īd Khān\r\n_Chaghatāī_, the then ruler in Kāshghar in whose service Ḥaidar Mīrzā\r\nwas, to come at once and occupy the fort. They said that Faqīr-i-`alī\r\nwho had been left in charge, was not strong enough to cope with the\r\nAūzbeg, begged Sa`īd to come, and strengthened their petition by\r\nreminding him of his hereditary right to Badakhshān, derived from Shāh\r\nBegīm _Badakhshī_. Their urgency convincing the Khān that risk\r\nthreatened the country, he started from Kāshghar in Muḥarram 936 AH.\r\n(Sept-Oct. 1529 AD.). On reaching Sārīgh-chūpān which by the annexation\r\nof Abā-bakr Mīrzā _Dūghlāt_ was now his own most western territory[2701]\r\nbut which formerly was one of the upper districts of Badakhshān, he\r\nwaited while Ḥaidar went on towards Qila`-i-ẕafar only to learn on his\r\nroad, that Hind-āl (_æt._ 10) had been sent from Kābul by Humāyūn and\r\nhad entered the fort 12 days before.\r\n\r\nThe Kāshgharīs were thus placed in the difficulty that the fort was\r\noccupied by Bābur's representative, and that the snows would prevent\r\ntheir return home across the mountains till winter was past.\r\nWinter-quarters were needed and asked for by Ḥaidar, certain districts\r\nbeing specified in which to await the re-opening of the Pāmīr routes. He\r\nfailed in his request, \"They did not trust us,\" he writes, \"indeed\r\nsuspected us of deceit.\" His own account of Sa`īd's earlier invasion of\r\nBadakhshān (925 AH.-1519 AD.) during Khān Mīrzā's rule, serves to\r\nexplain Badakhshī distrust of Kāshgharīs. Failing in his negotiations,\r\nhe scoured and pillaged the country round the fort, and when a few days\r\nlater the Khān arrived, his men took what Ḥaidar's had left.\r\n\r\nSa`īd Khān is recorded to have besieged the fort for three months, but\r\nnothing serious seems to have been attempted since no mention of\r\nfighting is made, none of assault or sally, and towards the end of the\r\nwinter he was waited on by those who had invited his presence, with\r\napology for not having admitted him into the fort, which they said they\r\nwould have done but for the arrival of Hind-āl Mīrzā. To this the Khān\r\nreplied that for him to oppose Bābur Pādshāh was impossible; he reminded\r\nthe chiefs that he was there by request, that it would be as hurtful for\r\nthe Pādshāh as for himself to have the Aūzbeg in Badakhshān and,\r\nfinally, he gave it as his opinion that, as matters stood, every man\r\nshould go home. His view of the general duty may include that of\r\nBadakhshī auxiliaries such as Sulṯān Wais of Kūl-āb who had reinforced\r\nthe garrison. So saying, he himself set out for Kāshghar, and at the\r\nbeginning of Spring reached Yārkand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Humāyūn's further action._\r\n\r\nHumāyūn will have reached Kābul before Ẕū'l-ḥijja 10th 935 AH. (Aug.\r\n26th 1529 AD.) because it is on record that he met Kāmrān on the Kābul\r\n'Īd-gāh, and both will have been there to keep the `Īdu'l-kabīr, the\r\nGreat Festival of Gifts, which is held on that day. Kāmrān had come from\r\nQandahār, whether to keep the Feast, or because he had heard of\r\nHumāyūn's intended movement from Badakhshān, or because changes were\r\nforeseen and he coveted Kābul, as the _Bābur-nāma_ and later records\r\nallow to be inferred. He asked Humāyūn, says Abū'l-faẓl, why he was\r\nthere and was told of his brother's impending journey to Āgra under\r\noverwhelming desire to see their Father.[2702] Presumably the two Mīrzās\r\ndiscussed the position in which Badakhshān had been left; in the end\r\nHind-āl was sent to Qila'-i-ẕafar, notwithstanding that he was under\r\norders for Hindūstān.\r\n\r\nHumāyūn may have stayed some weeks in Kābul, how many those familiar\r\nwith the seasons and the routes between Yārkand and Qila`-i-ẕafar,\r\nmight be able to surmise if the date of Hind-āl's start northward for\r\nwhich Humāyūn is likely to have waited, were found by dovetailing the\r\nMuḥarram of Sa`īd's start, the approximate length of his journey to\r\nSārīgh-chūpān, and Ḥaidar's reception of news that Hind-āl had been 12\r\ndays in the fort.\r\n\r\nHumāyūn's arrival in Āgra is said by Abū'l-faẓl to have been cheering to\r\nthe royal family in their sadness for the death of Alwar (end of 935\r\nAH.) and to have given pleasure to his Father. But the time is all too\r\nnear the date of Bābur's letter (f.348) to Humāyūn, that of a\r\ndissatisfied parent, to allow the supposition that his desertion of his\r\npost would fail to displease.\r\n\r\nThat it was a desertion and not an act of obedience seems clear from the\r\ncircumstance that the post had yet to be filled. Khalīfa is said to have\r\nbeen asked to take it and to have refused;[2703] Humāyūn to have been\r\nsounded as to return and to have expressed unwillingness. Bābur then did\r\nwhat was an honourable sequel to his acceptance in 926 AH. of the charge\r\nof the fatherless child Sulaimān, by sending him, now about 16, to take\r\ncharge where his father Khān Mīrzā had ruled, and by still keeping him\r\nunder his own protection.\r\n\r\nSulaimān's start from Āgra will not have been delayed, and (accepting\r\nAḥmad-i-yādgār's record,) Bābur himself will have gone as far as Lāhor\r\neither with him or shortly after him, an expedition supporting Sulaimān,\r\nand menacing Sa`īd in his winter leaguer round Qila`-i-ẕafar. Meantime\r\nHumāyūn was ordered to his fief of Saṃbhal.\r\n\r\nAfter Sulaimān's appointment Bābur wrote to Sa`īd a letter of which\r\nḤaidar gives the gist:—It expresses surprise at Sa`īd's doings in\r\nBadakhshān, says that Hind-āl has been recalled and Sulaimān sent, that\r\nif Sa`īd regard hereditary right, he will leave \"Sulaimān Shāh\r\nMīrzā\"[2704] in possession, who is as a son to them both,[2705] that\r\nthis would be well, that otherwise he (Bābur) will make over\r\nresponsibility to the heir (Sulaimān);[2706] and, \"The rest you\r\nknow.\"[2707]\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Bābur visits Lāhor._\r\n\r\nIf Aḥmad-i-yādgār's account of a journey made by Bābur to Lāhor and the\r\nPanj-āb be accepted, the _lacuna_ of 936 AH. is appropriately filled. He\r\nplaces the expedition in the 3rd year of Bābur's rule in Hindūstān,\r\nwhich, counting from the first reading of the _khuṯba_ for Bābur in\r\nDihlī (f. 286), began on Rajab 15th 935 AH. (March 26th 1529 AD.). But\r\nas Bābur's diary-record for 935 AH. is complete down to end of the year,\r\n(minor _lacunæ_ excepted), the time of his leaving Āgra for Lāhor is\r\nrelegated to 936 AH. He must have left early in the year, (1) to allow\r\ntime, before the occurrence of the known events preceding his own death,\r\nfor the long expedition Aḥmad-i-yādgār calls one of a year, and (2)\r\nbecause an early start after Humāyūn's arrival and Sulaimān's departure\r\nwould suit the position of affairs and the dates mentioned or implied by\r\nḤaidar's and by Aḥmad-i-yādgār's narratives.\r\n\r\nTwo reasons of policy are discernible, in the known events of the time,\r\nto recommend a journey in force towards the North-west; first, the\r\nsedition of `Abdu'l-`azīz in Lāhor (f. 381), and secondly, the invasion\r\nof Badakhshān by Sa`īd Khān with its resulting need of supporting\r\nSulaimān by a menace of armed intervention.[2708]\r\n\r\nIn Sihrind the Rāja of Kahlūr, a place which may be one of the Simla\r\nhill-states, waited on Bābur, made offering of 7 falcons and 3\r\n_mans_[2709] of gold, and was confirmed in his fief.[2710]\r\n\r\nIn Lāhor Kāmrān is said to have received his Father, in a garden of his\r\nown creation, and to have introduced the local chiefs as though he were\r\nthe Governor of Lāhor some writers describe him as then being. The best\r\nsources, however, leave him still posted in Qandahār. He had been\r\nappointed to Multān (f. 359) when `Askarī was summoned to Āgra (f. 339),\r\nbut whether he actually went there is not assured; some months later\r\n(Ẕū'l-ḥijja 10th 935 AH.) he is described by Abū'l-faẓl as coming to\r\nKābul from Qandahār. He took both Multān[2711] and Lāhor by force from\r\nhis (half-)brother Humāyūn in 935 AH. (1531 AD.) the year after their\r\nFather's death. That he should wait upon his Father in Lāhor would be\r\nnatural, Hind-āl did so, coming from Kābul. Hind-āl will have come to\r\nLāhor after making over charge of Qila`-i-ẕafar to Sulaimān, and he went\r\nback at the end of the cold season, going perhaps just before his Father\r\nstarted from Lāhor on his return journey, the gifts he received before\r\nleaving being 2 elephants, 4 horses, belts and jewelled daggers.[2712]\r\n\r\nBābur is said to have left Lāhor on Rajab 4th (936 AH.)-(March 4th, 1530\r\nAD.). From Aḥmad-i-yādgār's outline of Bābur's doings in Lāhor, he, or\r\nhis original, must be taken as ill-informed or indifferent about them.\r\nHis interest becomes greater when he writes of Samāna.\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. Punishment of the Mundāhirs._\r\n\r\nWhen Bābur, on his return journey, reached Sihrind, he received a\r\ncomplaint from the Qāẓī of Samāna against one Mohan _Mundāhir_ (or\r\n_Mundhār_)[2713] _Rājpūt_ who had attacked his estates, burning and\r\nplundering, and killed his son. Here-upon `Alī-qulī of Hamadān[2714] was\r\nsent with 3000 horse to avenge the Qāzī's wrongs, and reached Mohan's\r\nvillage, in the Kaithal _pargana_, early in the morning when the cold\r\nwas such that the archers \"could not pull their bows.\"[2715] A marriage\r\nhad been celebrated over-night; the villagers, issuing from warm houses,\r\nshot such flights of arrows that the royal troops could make no stand;\r\nmany were killed and nothing was effected; they retired into the jungle,\r\nlit fires, warmed themselves(?), renewed the attack and were again\r\nrepulsed. On hearing of their failure, Bābur sent off, perhaps again\r\nfrom Sihrind, Tarsam Bahādur and Naurang Beg with 6000 horse and many\r\nelephants. This force reached the village at night and when marriage\r\nfestivities were in progress. Towards morning it was formed into three\r\ndivisions,[2716] one of which was ordered to go to the west of the\r\nvillage and show itself. This having been done, the villagers advanced\r\ntowards it, in the pride of their recent success. The royal troops, as\r\nordered beforehand, turned their backs and fled, the Mundāhirs pursuing\r\nthem some two miles. Meantime Tarsam Bahādur had attacked and fired the\r\nvillage, killing many of its inhabitants. The pursuers on the west saw\r\nthe flames of their burning homes, ran back and were intercepted on\r\ntheir way. About 1000 men, women and children were made prisoner; there\r\nwas also great slaughter, and a pillar of heads was raised. Mohan was\r\ncaptured and later on was buried to the waist and shot to death with\r\narrows.[2717] News of the affair was sent to the Pādshāh.[2718]\r\n\r\nAs after being in Sihrind, Bābur is said to have spent two months\r\nhunting near Dihlī, it may be that he followed up the punitive\r\nexpedition sent into the Kaithal _pargana_ of the Karnāl District, by\r\nhunting in Nardak, a favourite ground of the Tīmūrids, which lies in\r\nthat district.\r\n\r\nThus the gap of 936 AH. with also perhaps a month of 937 AH. is filled\r\nby the \"year's\" travel west of Dihlī. The record is a mere outline and\r\nin it are periods of months without mention of where Bābur was or what\r\naffairs of government were brought before him. At some time, on his\r\nreturn journey presumably, he will have despatched to Kashmīr the\r\nexpedition referred to in the opening section of this appendix.\r\nSomething further may yet be gleaned from local chronicles, from\r\nunwritten tradition, or from the witness of place-names commemorating\r\nhis visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. Bābur's self-surrender to save Humāyūn._\r\n\r\nThe few months, perhaps 4 to 5, between Bābur's return to Āgra from his\r\nexpedition towards the North-west, and the time of his death are filled\r\nby Gul-badan and Abū'l-faẓl with matters concerning family interests\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nThe first such matter these authors mention is an illness of Humāyūn\r\nduring which Bābur devoted his own life to save his son's.[2719] Of this\r\nthe particulars are, briefly:—That Humāyūn, while still in Saṃbhal, had\r\nhad a violent attack of fever; that he was brought by water to Āgra, his\r\nmother meeting him in Muttra; and that when the disease baffled medical\r\nskill, Bābur resolved to practise the rite believed then and now in the\r\nEast to be valid, of intercession and devotion of a suppliant's most\r\nvalued possession in exchange for a sick man's life. Rejecting counsel\r\nto offer the Koh-i-nūr for pious uses, he resolved to supplicate for the\r\nacceptance of his life. He made intercession through a saint his\r\ndaughter names, and moved thrice round Humāyūn's bed, praying, in\r\neffect, \"O God! if a life may be exchanged for a life, I, who am Bābur,\r\ngive my life and my being for Humāyūn.\" During the rite fever surged\r\nover him, and, convinced that his prayer and offering had prevailed, he\r\ncried out, \"I have borne it away! I have borne it away!\"[2720] Gul-badan\r\nsays that he himself fell ill on that very day, while Humāyūn poured\r\nwater on his head, came out and gave audience; and that they carried her\r\nFather within on account of his illness, where he kept his bed for 2 or\r\n3 months.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt as to Bābur's faith in the rite he had practised,\r\nor as to his belief that his offering of life was accepted; moreover\r\nactual facts would sustain his faith and belief. Onlookers also must\r\nhave believed his prayer and offering to have prevailed, since Humāyūn\r\nwent back to Saṃbhal,[2721] while Bābur fell ill at once and died in a\r\nfew weeks.[2722]\r\n\r\n\r\n_f. A plan to set Bābur's sons aside from the succession._\r\n\r\nReading the _Akbar-nāma_ alone, there would seem to be no question about\r\nwhether Bābur ever intended to give Hindūstān, at any rate, to Humāyūn,\r\nbut, by piecing together various contributory matters, an opposite\r\nopinion is reached, _viz._ that not Khalīfa only whom Abū'l-faẓl names\r\nperhaps on Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad's warrant, but Bābur also, with some\r\nconsiderable number of chiefs, wished another ruler for Hindūstān. The\r\nstarting-point of this opinion is a story in the _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_\r\nand, with less detail, in the _Akbar-nāma_, of which the gist is that\r\nKhalīfa planned to supersede Humāyūn and his three brothers in their\r\nFather's succession.[2723]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BĀBUR IN PRAYER, DEVOTING HIMSELF FOR HIS SON.\r\n\r\n   _To face p. 702._]\r\n\r\nThe story, in brief, is as follows:—At the time of Bābur's death\r\nNiẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad's father Khwāja Muḥammad Muqīm _Harāwī_ was in the\r\nservice of the Office of Works.[2724] Amīr Niẕāmu'd-dīn `Alī Khalīfa,\r\nthe Chief of the Administration, had dread and suspicion about Humāyūn\r\nand did not favour his succession as Pādshāh. Nor did he favour that of\r\nBābur's other sons. He promised \"Bābur Pādshāh's son-in-law (_dāmād_)\"\r\nMahdī Khwāja who was a generous young man, very friendly to himself,\r\nthat he would make him Pādshāh. This promise becoming known, others made\r\ntheir _salām_ to the Khwāja who put on airs and accepted the position.\r\nOne day when Khalīfa, accompanied by Muqīm, went to see Mahdī Khwāja in\r\nhis tent, no-one else being present, Bābur, in the pangs of his disease,\r\nsent for him[2725] when he had been seated a few minutes only. When\r\nKhalīfa had gone out, Mahdī Khwāja remained standing in such a way that\r\nMuqīm could not follow but, the Khwāja unaware, waited respectfully\r\nbehind him. The Khwāja, who was noted for the wildness of youth, said,\r\nstroking his beard, \"Please God! first, I will flay thee!\" turned round\r\nand saw Muqīm, took him by the ear, repeated a proverb of menace, \"The\r\nred tongue gives the green head to the wind,\" and let him go. Muqīm\r\nhurried to Khalīfa, repeated the Khwāja's threat against him, and\r\nremonstrated about the plan to set all Bābur's sons aside in favour of a\r\nstranger-house.[2726] Here-upon Khalīfa sent for Humāyūn,[2727] and\r\ndespatched an officer with orders to the Khwāja to retire to his house,\r\nwho found him about to dine and hurried him off without ceremony.\r\nKhalīfa also issued a proclamation forbidding intercourse with him,\r\nexcluded him from Court, and when Bābur died, supported Humāyūn.\r\n\r\nAs Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad was not born till 20 years after Bābur died, the\r\nstory will have been old before he could appreciate it, and it was some\r\n60 years old when it found way into the _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_ and, with\r\nless detail, into the _Akbar-nāma_.\r\n\r\nTaken as it stands, it is incredible, because it represents Khalīfa, and\r\nhim alone, planning to subject the four sons of Bābur to the suzerainty\r\nof Mahdī Khwāja who was not a Tīmūrid, who, so far as well-known sources\r\nshow, was not of a ruling dynasty or personally illustrious,[2728] and\r\nwho had been associated, so lately as the autumn of 1529 AD., with his\r\nnephew Raḥīm-dād in seditious action which had so angered Bābur that,\r\nwhatever the punishment actually ordered, rumour had it both men were to\r\ndie.[2729] In two particulars the only Mahdī Khwāja then of Bābur's\r\nfollowing, does not suit the story; he was not a young man in 1530\r\nAD.,[2730] and was not a _dāmād_ of Bābur, if that word be taken in its\r\nusual sense of son-in-law, but he was a _yazna_, husband of a Pādshāh's\r\nsister, in his case, of Khān-zāda Begīm.[2731] Some writers style him\r\nSayyid Mahdī Khwāja, a double title which may indicate descent on both\r\nsides from religious houses; one is suggested to be that of Tirmiẕ by\r\nthe circumstance that in his and Khān-zāda Begīm's mausoleum was buried\r\na Tirmiẕ sayyid of later date, Shāh Abū'l-ma`ālī. But though he were of\r\nTirmiẕ, it is doubtful if that religious house would be described by the\r\nword _khānwāda_ which so frequently denotes a ruling dynasty.\r\n\r\nHis name may have found its way into Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad's story as a\r\ngloss mistakenly amplifying the word _dāmād_, taken in its less usual\r\nsense of brother-in-law. To Bābur's contemporaries the expression \"Bābur\r\nPādshāh's _dāmād_\" (son-in-law) would be explicit, because for some 11\r\nyears before he lay on his death-bed, he had one son-in-law only, _viz._\r\nMuḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā _Bāī-qarā_,[2732] the husband of Ma`ṣūma Sulṯān\r\nBegīm. If that Mīrzā's name were where Mahdī Khwāja's is entered, the\r\nstory of an exclusion of Bābur's sons from rule might have a core of\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nIt is incredible however that Khālīfa, with or without Bābur's\r\nconcurrence, made the plan attributed to him of placing any man not a\r\nTīmūrid in the position of Pādshāh over all Bābur's territory. I suggest\r\nthat the plan concerned Hindūstān only and was one considered in\r\nconnection with Bābur's intended return to Kābul, when he must have left\r\nthat difficult country, hardly yet a possession, in charge of some man\r\ngiving promise of power to hold it. Such a man Humāyūn was not. My\r\nsuggestion rests on the following considerations:—\r\n\r\n(1) Bābur's outlook was not that of those in Āgra in 1587 AD. who gave\r\nAbū'l-faẓl his Bāburiana material, because at that date Dihlī had become\r\nthe pivot of Tīmūrid power, so that not to hold Hindūstān would imply\r\nnot to be Pādshāh. Bābur's outlook on his smaller Hindūstān was\r\ndifferent; his position in it was precarious, Kābul, not Dihlī, was his\r\nchosen centre, and from Kābul his eyes looked northwards as well as to\r\nthe East. If he had lost the Hindūstān which was approximately the\r\nmodern United Provinces, he might still have held what lay west of it to\r\nthe Indus, as well as Qandahār.\r\n\r\n(2) For several years before his death he had wished to return to Kābul.\r\nAmple evidence of this wish is given by his diary, his letters, and some\r\npoems in his second _Dīwān_ (that found in the Rāmpūr MS.). As he told\r\nhis sons more than once, he kept Kābul for himself.[2733] If, instead\r\nof dying in Āgra, he had returned to Kābul, had pushed his way on from\r\nBadakhshān, whether as far as Samarkand or less, had given Humāyūn a\r\nseat in those parts,—action foreshadowed by the records—a reasonable\r\ninterpretation of the story that Humāyūn and his brothers were not to\r\ngovern Hindūstān, is that he had considered with Khalīfa the\r\napportionment of his territories according to the example of his\r\nancestors Chīngīz Khān, Tīmūr and Abū-sa`īd; that by his plan of\r\napportionment Humāyūn was not to have Hindūstān but something\r\nTramontane; Kāmrān had already Qandahār; Sulaimān, if Humāyūn had moved\r\nbeyond the out-post of Badakhshān, would have replaced him there; and\r\nHindūstān would have gone to \"Bābur Pādshāh's _dāmād_\".\r\n\r\n(3) Muḥammad-i-zamān had much to recommend him for\r\nHindūstān:—Tīmūrid-born, grandson and heir of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, husband\r\nof Ma`ṣūma who was a Tīmūrid by double descent,[2734] protected by Bābur\r\nafter the Bāī-qarā _débacle_ in Herāt, a landless man leading such other\r\nexiles as Muḥammad Sulṯān Mīrzā,[2735] `Ādil Sulṯān, and Qāsim-i-ḥusain\r\nSulṯān, half-Tīmūrids all, who with their Khurāsānī following, had been\r\nBābur's guests in Kābul, had pressed on its poor resources, and thus had\r\nhelped in 932 AH. (1525 AD.) to drive him across the Indus. This\r\nBāī-qarā group needed a location; Muḥammad-i-zamān's future had to be\r\ncared for and with his, Ma`ṣūma's.\r\n\r\n(4) It is significant of intention to give Muḥammad-i-zamān ruling\r\nstatus that in April 1529 AD. (Sha`bān 935 AH.) Bābur bestowed on him\r\nroyal insignia, including the umbrella-symbol of sovereignty.[2736] This\r\nwas done after the Mīrzā had raised objections, unspecified now in the\r\n_Bābur-nāma_ against Bihār; they were overcome, the insignia were given\r\nand, though for military reasons he was withheld from taking up that\r\nappointment, the recognition of his royal rank had been made. His next\r\nappointment was to Jūnpūr, the capital of the fallen Sharqī dynasty. No\r\nother chief is mentioned by Bābur as receiving the insignia of royalty.\r\n\r\n(5) It appears to have been within a Pādshāh's competence to select his\r\nsuccessor; and it may be inferred that choice was made between Humāyūn\r\nand another from the wording of more than one writer that Khalīfa\r\n\"supported\" Humāyūn, and from the word \"selected\" used in\r\nAḥmad-i-yādgār's anecdote.[2737] Much more would there be freedom of\r\nchoice in a division of territory such as there is a good deal to\r\nsuggest was the basis of Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad's story. Whatever the extent\r\nof power proposed for the _dāmād_, whether, as it is difficult to\r\nbelieve, the Pādshāh's whole supremacy, or whether the limited\r\nsovereignty of Hindūstān, it must have been known to Bābur as well as to\r\nKhalīfa. Whatever their earlier plan however, it was changed by the\r\nsequel of Humāyūn's illness which led to his becoming Pādshāh. The\r\n_dāmād_ was dropped, on grounds it is safe to believe more impressive\r\nthan his threat to flay Khalīfa or than the remonstrance of that high\r\nofficial's subordinate Muqīm of Herāt.\r\n\r\nHumāyūn's arrival and continued stay in Hindūstān modified earlier\r\ndispositions which included his remaining in Badakhshān. His actions may\r\nexplain why Bābur, when in 936 AH. he went as far as Lāhor, did not go\r\non to Kābul. Nothing in the sources excludes the surmise that Māhīm knew\r\nof the bestowal of royal insignia on the Bāī-qarā Mīrzā, that she\r\nsummoned her son to Āgra and there kept him, that she would do this the\r\nmore resolutely if the _dāmād_ of the plan she must have heard of, were\r\nthat Bāī-qarā, and that but for Humāyūn's presence in Āgra and its\r\nattendant difficulties, Bābur would have gone to Kābul, leaving his\r\n_dāmād_ in charge of Hindūstān.\r\n\r\nBābur, however, turned back from Lāhor for Āgra, and there he made the\r\nself-surrender which, resulting in Humāyūn's \"selection\" as Pādshāh,\r\nbecame a turning point in history.\r\n\r\nHumāyūn's recovery and Bābur's immediate illness will have made the\r\nson's life seem Divinely preserved, the father's as a debt to be paid.\r\nBābur's impressive personal experience will have dignified Humāyūn as\r\none whom God willed should live. Such distinction would dictate the\r\nbestowal on him of all that fatherly generosity had yet to give. The\r\nimminence of death defeating all plans made for life, Humāyūn was\r\nnominated to supreme power as Pādshāh.\r\n\r\n\r\n_g. Bābur's death._\r\n\r\nAmongst other family matters mentioned by Gul-badan as occurring shortly\r\nbefore her Father's death, was his arrangement of marriages for Gul-rang\r\nwith Aīsān-tīmūr and for Gul-chihra with Tūkhta-būghā _Chaghatāī_. She\r\nalso writes of his anxiety to see Hind-āl who had been sent for from\r\nKābul but did not arrive till the day after the death.\r\n\r\nWhen no remedies availed, Humāyūn was summoned from Saṃbhal. He reached\r\nĀgra four days before the death; on the morrow Bābur gathered his chiefs\r\ntogether for the last of many times, addressed them, nominated Humāyūn\r\nhis successor and bespoke their allegiance for him. Abū'l-faẓl thus\r\nsummarizes his words, \"Lofty counsels and weighty mandates were\r\nimparted. Advice was given (to Humāyūn) to be munificent and just, to\r\nacquire God's favour, to cherish and protect subjects, to accept\r\napologies from such as had failed in duty, and to pardon transgressors.\r\nAnd, he (Bābur) exclaimed, the cream of my testamentary dispositions is\r\nthis, 'Do naught against your brothers, even though they may deserve\r\nit.' In truth,\" continues the historian, \"it was through obedience to\r\nthis mandate that his Majesty Jannat-ashiyānī suffered so many injuries\r\nfrom his brothers without avenging himself.\" Gul-badan's account of her\r\nFather's last address is simple:—\"He spoke in this wise, 'For years it\r\nhas been in my heart to make over the throne to Humāyūn and to retire to\r\nthe Gold-scattering Garden. By the Divine grace I have obtained in\r\nhealth of body everything but the fulfilment of this wish. Now that\r\nillness has laid me low, I charge you all to acknowledge Humāyūn in my\r\nstead. Fail not in loyalty towards him. Be of one heart and mind towards\r\nhim. I hope to God that he, for his part, will bear himself well towards\r\nmen. Moreover, Humāyūn, I commit you and your brothers and all my\r\nkinsfolk and your people and my people to God's keeping, and entrust\r\nthem all to you.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was on Monday Jumāda 1. 5th 937 AH. (Dec. 26th 153O AD.) that Bābur\r\nmade answer to his summons with the _Adsum_ of the Musalmān, \"Lord! I am\r\nhere for Thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Black fell the day for children and kinsfolk and all,\" writes his\r\ndaughter;\r\n\r\n   \"Alas! that time and the changeful heaven should exist without thee;\r\n    Alas! and Alas! that time should remain and thou shouldst be gone;\"\r\n\r\nmourns Khwāja Kalān in the funeral ode from which Badāyūnī quoted these\r\nlines.[2738]\r\n\r\nThe body was laid in the Garden-of-rest (_Ārām-bāgh_) which is opposite\r\nto where the Tāj-i-maḥāll now stands. Khwāja Muḥammad `Alī _`asas_[2739]\r\nwas made the guardian of the tomb, and many well-voiced readers and\r\nreciters were appointed to conduct the five daily Prayers and to offer\r\nsupplication for the soul of the dead. The revenues of Sīkrī and 5\r\n_laks_ from Bīāna were set aside for the endowment of the tomb, and\r\nMāhīm Begīm, during the two and a half years of her remaining life, sent\r\ntwice daily from her own estate, an allowance of food towards the\r\nsupport of its attendants.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the directions of his will, Bābur's body was to be\r\nconveyed to Kābul and there to be laid in the garden of his choice, in a\r\ngrave open to the sky, with no building over it, no need of a\r\ndoor-keeper.\r\n\r\nPrecisely when it was removed from Āgra we have not found stated. It is\r\nknown from Gul-badan that Kāmrān visited his Father's tomb in Āgra in\r\n1539 AD. (946 AH.) after the battle of Chausa; and it is known from\r\nJauhar that the body had been brought to Kābul before 1544 AD. (952\r\nAH.), at which date Humāyūn, in Kābul, spoke with displeasure of\r\nKāmrān's incivility to \"Bega Begīm\", the \"Bībī\" who had conveyed their\r\nFather's body to that place.[2740] That the widow who performed this\r\nduty was the Afghān Lady, Bībī Mubārika[2741] is made probable by\r\nGul-badan's details of the movements of the royal ladies. Bābur's family\r\nleft Āgra under Hind-āl's escort, after the defeat at Chausa (June 7th,\r\n1539 AD.); whoever took charge of the body on its journey to Kābul must\r\nhave returned at some later date to fetch it. It would be in harmony\r\nwith Sher Shāh's generous character if he safe-guarded her in her task.\r\n\r\nThe terraced garden Bābur chose for his burial-place lies on the slope\r\nof the hill Shāh-i-Kābul, the Sher-darwāza of European writers.[2742] It\r\nhas been described as perhaps the most beautiful of the Kābul gardens,\r\nand as looking towards an unsurpassable view over the Chār-dih plain\r\ntowards the snows of Paghmān and the barren, rocky hills which have been\r\nthe hunting-grounds of rulers in Kābul. Several of Bābur's descendants\r\ncoming to Kābul from Āgra have visited and embellished his\r\nburial-garden. Shāh-i-jahān built the beautiful mosque which stands near\r\nthe grave; Jahāngīr seems to have been, if not the author, at least the\r\nprompter of the well-cut inscription adorning the upright slab of white\r\nmarble of Māīdān, which now stands at the grave-head. The tomb-stone\r\nitself is a low grave-covering, not less simple than those of relations\r\nand kin whose remains have been placed near Bābur's. In the thirties of\r\nthe last century [the later Sir] Alexander Burnes visited and admirably\r\ndescribed the garden and the tomb. With him was Munshī Mohan Lāl who\r\nadded to his own account of the beauties of the spot, copies of the\r\ninscriptions on the monumental slab and on the portal of the\r\nMosque.[2743] As is shown by the descriptions these two visitors give,\r\nand by Daniel's drawings of the garden and the tomb, there were in their\r\ntime two upright slabs, one behind the other, near the head of the\r\ngrave. Mr. H. H. Hayden who visited the garden in the first decade of\r\nthe present century, shows in his photograph of the grave, one upright\r\nstone only, the place of one of the former two having been taken by a\r\nwhite-washed lamp holder (_chirāghdān_).\r\n\r\nThe purport of the verses inscribed on the standing-slab is as follows:—\r\n\r\n   A ruler from whose brow shone the Light of God was that[2744]\r\n   Back-bone of the Faith (_ẕahīru'd-dīn_) Muḥammad Bābur\r\n   Pādshāh. Together with majesty, dominion, fortune, rectitude,\r\n   the open-hand and the firm Faith, he had share in prosperity,\r\n   abundance and the triumph of victorious arms. He won the\r\n   material world and became a moving light; for his every\r\n   conquest he looked, as for Light, towards the world of souls.\r\n   When Paradise became his dwelling and Ruẓwān[2745] asked me\r\n   the date, I gave him for answer, \"Paradise is forever Bābur\r\n   Pādshāh's abode.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_h. Bābur's wives and children._[2746]\r\n\r\nBābur himself mentions several of his wives by name, but Gul-badan is\r\nthe authority for complete lists of them and their children.\r\n\r\n1. `Āyisha Sulṯān Begīm, daughter of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā _Mīrān-shāhī_ was\r\nbetrothed, when Bābur was _cir._ 5 years old, in 894 AH. (1488-89 AD.),\r\nbore Fakhru'n-nisa' in 906 AH. [who died in about one month], left Bābur\r\nbefore 909 AH. (1503 AD.).\r\n\r\n2. Zainab Sl. Begīm, daughter of Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā _Mīrān-shāhī_, was\r\nmarried in 910 AH. (1504-5 AD.), died childless two or three years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n3. Māhīm Begīm, whose parentage is not found stated, was married in 912\r\nAH. (1506 AD.), bore Bār-būd, Mihr-jān, Āīsān-daulat, Farūq [who all\r\ndied in infancy], and Humāyūn.\r\n\r\n4. Ma`ṣūma Sl. Begīm, daughter of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā _Mīrān-shāhī_, was\r\nmarried in 913 AH. (1507 AD.), bore Ma`ṣūma and died at her birth,\r\npresumably early in the _lacuna_ of 914-925 AH. (1508-19 AD.).\r\n\r\n5. Gul-rukh Begīm, whose parentage is not found stated, was perhaps a\r\nBegchīk Mughūl, was married between 914 AH. and 925 AH. (1508-19 AD.),\r\nprobably early in the period, bore Shāh-rukh, Aḥmad [who both died\r\nyoung], Gul`iẕār [who also may have died young], Kamrān and `Askarī.\r\n\r\n6. Dil-dār Begīm, whose parentage is not found stated, was married in\r\nthe same period as Gul-rukh, bore Gul-rang, Gul-chihra, Hind-āl,\r\nGul-badan and Alwar, [who died in childhood].\r\n\r\n7. The Afghān Lady (Afghānī Āghācha), Bībī Mubārika _Yūsufzāī_, was\r\nmarried in 925 AH. (1519 AD.), and died childless.\r\n\r\nThe two Circassian slaves Gul-nār Āghācha and Nār-gul Āghācha of whom\r\nT̤ahmāsp made gift to Bābur in 933 AH. (f. 305), became recognized\r\nladies of the royal household. They are mentioned several times by\r\nGul-badan as taking part in festivities and in family conferences under\r\nHumāyūn. Gul-nār is said by Abū'l-faẓl to have been one of Gul-badan's\r\npilgrim band in 983 AH. (1575 AD.).\r\n\r\nThe above list contains the names of three wives whose parentage is not\r\ngiven or is vaguely given by the well-known sources,—namely, Māhīm,\r\nGul-rukh and Dil-dār. What would sufficiently explain the absence of\r\nmention by Bābur of the parentage of Gul-rukh and Dil-dār is that his\r\nrecord of the years within which the two Begīms were married is not now\r\nwith the _Bābur-nāma_. Presumably it has been lost, whether in diary or\r\nnarrative form, in the _lacuna_ of 914-25 AH. (1508-19 AD.). Gul-rukh\r\nappears to have belonged to the family of Begchīk Mughūls described by\r\nḤaidar Mīrzā[2747]; her brothers are styled Mīrzā; she was of good but\r\nnot royal birth. Dil-dār's case is less simple. Nothing in her daughter\r\nGul-badan's book suggests that she and her children were other than of\r\nthe highest rank; numerous details and shades of expression show their\r\nease of equality with royal personages. It is consistent with\r\nGul-badan's method of enumerating her father's wives that she should not\r\nstate her own mother's descent; she states it of none of her \"mothers\".\r\nThere is this interest in trying to trace Dil-dār's parentage, that she\r\nmay have been the third daughter of Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā and Pasha Begīm,\r\nand a daughter of hers may have been the mother of Salīma Sulṯān Begīm\r\nwho was given in marriage by Humāyūn to Bairām Khān, later was married\r\nby Akbar, and was a woman of charm and literary accomplishments. Later\r\nhistorians, Abū'l-faẓl amongst their number, say that Salīma's mother\r\nwas a daughter of Bābur's wife Sālḥa Sulṯān Begīm, and vary that\r\ndaughter's name as Gul-rang-rukh-barg or -`iẕār (the last form being an\r\nequivalent of _chihra_, face). As there cannot have been a wife with her\r\ndaughter growing up in Bābur's household, who does not appear in some\r\nway in Gul-badan's chronicle, and as Salīma's descent from Bābur need\r\nnot be questioned, the knot is most readily loosened by surmising that\r\n\"Sālḥa\" is the real name of Gul-badan's \"Dildār\". Instances of double\r\nnames are frequent, _e.g._ Māhīm, Māh-chīchām, Qarā-gūz, Āq, (My Moon,\r\nMy Moon sister, Black-eyed, Fair). \"Heart-holding\" (Dil-dār) sounds like\r\na home-name of affection. It is the _Ma`āsir-ī-raḥīmī_ which gives Sālḥa\r\nas the name of Bābur's wife, Pasha's third daughter. Its author may be\r\nwrong, writing so late as he did (1025 AH.-1616 AD.), or may have been\r\nunaware that Sālḥa was (if she were) known as Dil-dār. It would not war\r\nagainst seeming facts to take Pasha's third daughter to be Bābur's wife\r\nDil-dār, and Dil-dār's daughter Gul-chihra to be Salīma's mother.\r\nGul-chihra was born in about 1516 AD., married to Tūkhta-būghā in 1530\r\nAD., widowed in cir. 1533 AD., might have remarried with Nūru'd-dīn\r\n_Chaqānīānī_ (Sayyid Amīr), and in 945 AH. might have borne him Salīma;\r\nshe was married in 1547 AD. (954 AH.) to `Abbās Sulṯān _Aūzbeg_.[2748]\r\nTwo matters, neither having much weight, make against taking Dil-dār to\r\nbe a _Mīrān-shāhī_; the first being that the anonymous annotator who\r\nadded to the archetype of Kehr's Codex what is entered in Appendix\r\nL.—_On Māhīm's adoption of Hind-āl_, styles her Dil-dār Āghācha; he,\r\nhowever, may have known no more than others knew of her descent; the\r\nsecond, that Māhīm forcibly took Dil-dār's child Hind-āl to rear; she\r\nwas the older wife and the mother of the heir, but could she have taken\r\nthe upper hand over a Mīrān-shāhī? A circumstance complicating the\r\nquestion of Salīma's maternal descent is, that historians searching the\r\n_Bābur-nāma_ or its Persian translation the _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_ for\r\ninformation about the three daughters of Maḥmūd _Mīrān-shāhī_ and Pasha\r\n_Bahārlū Turkmān_, would find an incomplete record, one in which the\r\nhusbands of the first and second daughters are mentioned and nothing is\r\nsaid about the third who was Bābur's wife and the grandmother of Salīma.\r\nBābur himself appears to have left the record as it is, meaning to fill\r\nit in later; presumably he waited for the names of the elder two sisters\r\nto complete his details of the three. In the Ḥaidarabad Codex, which\r\nthere is good ground for supposing a copy of his original manuscript,\r\nabout three lines are left blank (f. 27) as if awaiting information; in\r\nmost manuscripts, however, this indication of intention is destroyed by\r\nrunning the defective passage on to join the next sentence. Some chance\r\nremark of a less well-known writer, may clear up the obscurity and show\r\nthat Sālḥa was Dil-dār.\r\n\r\nMāhīm's case seems one having a different cause for silence about her\r\nparentage. When she was married in Herāt, shortly after the death of Sl.\r\nḤusain Mīrzā, Bābur had neither wife nor child. What Abū'l-faẓl tells\r\nabout her is vague; her father's name is not told; she is said to have\r\nbelonged to a noble Khurāsān family, to have been related\r\n(_nisbat-i-khwesh_) to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā and to have traced her descent\r\nto Shaikh Aḥmad of Jām. If her birth had been high, even though not\r\nroyal, it is strange that it is not stated by Bābur when he records the\r\nbirth of her son Humāyūn, incidentally by Gul-badan, or more precisely\r\nby Abū'l-faẓl. Her brothers belonged to Khost, and to judge from a\r\nconsiderable number of small records, seem to have been quiet, unwarlike\r\nKhwājas. Her marriage took place in a year of which a full record\r\nsurvives; it is one in the composed narrative, not in the diary. In the\r\nfollowing year, this also being one included in the composed narrative,\r\nBābur writes of his meeting with Ma`ṣūma _Mīrān-shāhī_ in Herāt, of\r\ntheir mutual attraction, and of their marriage. If the marriage with\r\nHumāyūn's mother had been an equal alliance, it would agree with Bābur's\r\ncustom to mention its occurrence, and to give particulars about Māhīm's\r\ndescent.[2749]\r\n\r\n\r\n_i. Mr. William Erskine's estimate of Bābur._\r\n\r\n\"Z̤ahīru'd-dīn Muḥammad Bābur was undoubtedly one of the most\r\nillustrious men of his age, and one of the most eminent and accomplished\r\nprinces that ever adorned an Asiatic throne. He is represented as having\r\nbeen above the middle size, of great vigour of body, fond of all field\r\nand warlike sports, an excellent swordsman, and a skilful archer. As a\r\nproof of his bodily strength, it is mentioned, that he used to leap from\r\none pinnacle to another of the pinnacled ramparts used in the East, in\r\nhis double-soled boots; and that he even frequently took a man under\r\neach arm and went leaping along the rampart from one of the pointed\r\npinnacles to another. Having been early trained to the conduct of\r\nbusiness, and tutored in the school of adversity, the powers of his mind\r\nreceived full development. He ascended the throne at the age of twelve,\r\nand before he had attained his twentieth year, had shared every variety\r\nof fortune; he had not only been the ruler of subject provinces but had\r\nbeen in thraldom to his own ambitious nobles, and obliged to conceal\r\nevery sentiment of his heart; he had been alternately hailed and obeyed\r\nas a conqueror and deliverer by rich and extensive kingdoms, and forced\r\nto lurk in the deserts and mountains of Farghāna as a houseless\r\nwanderer. Down to the last dregs of life, we perceive in him strong\r\nfeelings of affection for his early friends and early enjoyments. * * *\r\nHe had been taught betimes, by the voice of events that cannot lie, that\r\nhe was a man dependent on the kindness and fidelity of other men; and,\r\nin his dangers and escapes with his followers, had learned that he was\r\nonly one of an association. * * * The native benevolence and gaiety of\r\nhis disposition seems ever to overflow on all around him; * * * of his\r\ncompanions in arms he speaks with the frank gaiety of a soldier. * * *\r\nAmbitious he was and fond of conquest and glory in all its shapes; the\r\nenterprise in which he was for a season engaged, seems to have absorbed\r\nhis whole soul, and all his faculties were exerted to bring it to a\r\nfortunate issue. His elastic mind was not broken by discomfiture, and\r\nfew who have achieved such glorious conquests, have suffered more\r\nnumerous or more decisive defeats. His personal courage was conspicuous\r\nduring his whole life. Upon the whole, if we review with impartiality\r\nthe history of Asia, we find few princes entitled to rank higher than\r\nBābur in genius and accomplishments. * * * In activity of mind, in the\r\ngay equanimity and unbroken spirit with which he bore the extremes of\r\ngood and bad fortune, in the possession of the manly and social virtues,\r\nin his love of letters and his success in the cultivation of them, we\r\nshall probably find no other Asiatic prince who can justly be placed\r\nbeside him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.—THE SITE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF OLD AKHSĪ.\r\n\r\nSome modern writers, amongst whom are Dr. Schuyler, General Nalivkine\r\nand Mr. Pumpelly, have inferred from the Bābur-nāma account of Akhsī,\r\n(in its translations?) that the landslip through which Bābur's father\r\ndied and the disappearance of old Akhsī were brought about by erosion.\r\nSeen by the light of modern information, this erosion theory does not\r\nseem to cover the whole ground and some other cause seems necessary in\r\nexplanation of both events.\r\n\r\nFor convenience of reference, the Bābur-nāma passages required, are\r\nquoted here, with their translations.\r\n\r\n   Ḥai.

Sh.

Mīrzā jardīn\r\n   kabūtar u kabūtar-khāna bīla aūchūb shunqār būldī_;—'It has been\r\n   mentioned that the walled-town of Akhsī is situated above\r\n   ravine(s). The royal dwellings are along a ravine. The Mīrzā,\r\n   having flown with his pigeons and their house from the ravine,\r\n   became a falcon (_i.e._ died).'\r\n\r\nA few particulars about Akhsī will shew that, in the translations just\r\nquoted, certain small changes of wording are dictated by what, amongst\r\nother writers, Kostenko and von Schwarz have written about the oases of\r\nTurkistān.\r\n\r\nThe name Akhsī, as used by Ibn Haukal, Yāqūt and Bābur, describes an\r\noasis township, _i.e._ a walled-town with its adjacent cultivated lands.\r\nIn Yāqūt's time Akhsī had a second circumvallation, presumably less for\r\ndefence than for the protection of crops against wild animals. The oasis\r\nwas created by the Kāsān-water,[2750] upon the riverain loess of the\r\nright and higher bank of the Saiḥūn (Sīr), on level ground west of the\r\njunction of the Nārīn and the Qarā-daryā, west too of spurs from the\r\nnorthern hills which now abut upon the river. Yāqūt locates it in the\r\n12th century, at one _farsākh_ (_circa_ 4 m.) north of the river.[2751]\r\nDepending as it did solely on the Kāsān-water, nothing dictated its\r\nlocation close to the Sīr, along which there is now, and there seems to\r\nhave been in the 12th century, a strip of waste land. Bābur says of\r\nAkhsī what Kostenko says (i, 321) of modern Tāshkīnt, that it stood\r\nabove ravines (_jarlār_). These were natural or artificial channels of\r\nthe Kāsān-water.[2752]\r\n\r\nTo turn now to the translations;—Mr. Erskine imaged Akhsī as a castle,\r\nhigh on a precipice in process of erosion by the Sīr. But Bābur's word,\r\n_qūrghān_ means the walled-town; his word for a castle is _ark_,\r\ncitadel; and his _jar_, a cleft, is not rendered by 'precipice.'\r\nAgain;—it is no more necessary to understand that the Sīr flowed close\r\nto the walls than it is to understand, when one says the Thames flows\r\npast below Richmond, that it washes the houses on the hill.\r\n\r\nThe key to the difficulties in the Turkī passage is provided by a\r\nspecial use of the word _jar_ for not only natural ravines but\r\nartificial water-cuts for irrigation. This use of it makes clear that\r\nwhat `Umar Shaikh did at Akhsī was not to make escarpments but to cut\r\nnew water-channels. Presumably he joined those 'further out' on the\r\ndeltaic fan, on the east and west of the town, so as to secure a\r\ncontinuous defensive cleft round the town[2753] or it may be, in order\r\nto bring it more water.\r\n\r\nConcerning the historic pigeon-house (f. 6_b_), it can be said safely\r\nthat it did not fall into the Sīr; it fell from a _jar_, and in this\r\npart of its course, the river flows in a broad bed, with a low left\r\nbank. Moreover the Mīrzā's residence was in the walled-town (f. 110_b_)\r\nand there his son stayed 9 years after the accident. The slip did not\r\naffect the safety of the residence therefore; it may have been local to\r\nthe birds' house. It will have been due to some ordinary circumstance\r\nsince no cause for it is mentioned by Bābur, Ḥaidar or Abū'l-faẓl. If it\r\nhad marked the crisis of the Sīr's approach, Akhsī could hardly have\r\nbeen described, 25 years later, as a strong fort.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething is known of Akhsī, in the 10th, the 12th, the 15th and the\r\n19th centuries, which testifies to sæcular decadence. Ibn Haukal and\r\nYāqūt give the township an extent of 3 _farsākh_ (12 miles), which may\r\nmean from one side to an opposite one. Yāqūt's description of it\r\nmentions four gates, each opening into well-watered lands extending a\r\nwhole _farsākh_, in other words it had a ring of garden-suburb four\r\nmiles wide.\r\n\r\nTwo meanings have been given to Bābur's words indicating the status of\r\nthe oasis in the 15th century. They are, _maḥallātī qūrghān-dīn bīr\r\nshar`ī yurāqrāq tūshūb tūr_. They have been understood as saying that\r\nthe suburbs were two miles from their _urbs_. This may be right but I\r\nhesitate to accept it without pointing out that the words may mean, 'Its\r\nsuburbs extend two miles farther than the walled-town.' Whichever verbal\r\nreading is correct, reveals a decayed oasis.\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century, Nalivkine and Ujfalvy describe the place then\r\nbearing the name Akhsī, as a small village, a mere winter-station, at\r\nsome distance from the river's bank, that bank then protected from\r\ndenudation by a sand-bank.\r\n\r\nThree distinctly-marked stages of decadence in the oasis township are\r\nthus indicated by Yāqūt, Bābur and the two modern travellers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to say something further about the position of the\r\nsuburbs in the 15th century. Bābur quotes as especially suitable to\r\nAkhsī, the proverbial questions, 'Where is the village?'[2754] (qy.\r\nAkhsī-kīnt.) 'Where are the trees?' and these might be asked by some-one\r\nin the suburbs unable to see Akhsī or _vice versâ_. But granting that\r\nthere were no suburbs within two miles of the town, why had the whole\r\ninner circle, two miles of Yāqūt's four, gone out of cultivation?\r\nErosion would have affected only land between the river and the town.\r\n\r\nAgain;—if the Sīr only were working in the 15th century to destroy a\r\ntown standing on the Kāsān-water, how is it that this stream does not\r\nyet reach the Sīr?\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious ingatherings of information create the impression that failure\r\nof Kāsān-water has been the dominant factor in the loss of the Akhsī\r\ntownship. Such failure might be due to the general desiccation of\r\nCentral Asia and also to increase of cultivation in the Kāsān-valley\r\nitself. There may have been erosion, and social and military change may\r\nhave had its part, but for the loss of the oasis lands and for, as a\r\nsequel, the decay of the town, desiccation seems a sufficient cause.\r\n\r\nThe Kāsān-water still supports an oasis on its riverain slope, the large\r\nAūzbeg town of Tūpa-qūrghān (Town-of-the-hill), from the modern castle\r\nof which a superb view is had up the Kāsān-valley, now thickly studded\r\nwith villages.[2755]\r\n\r\n\r\nB.—THE BIRDS, QĪL QŪYIRŪGH AND BĀGHRĪ QARĀ.\r\n\r\nDescribing a small bird (_qūsh-qīna_), abundant in the Qarshī district\r\n(f. 49_b_), Bābur names it the _qīl-qūyirūgh_, horse-tail, and says it\r\nresembles the _bāghrī qarā_.\r\n\r\nLater on he writes (f. 280) that the _bāghrī qarā_ of India is smaller\r\nand more slender than 'those' _i.e._ of Transoxiana (f. 49_b_, n. 1),\r\nthe blackness of its breast less deep, and its cry less piercing.\r\n\r\nWe have had difficulty in identifying the birds but at length conclude\r\nthat the _bāghrī qarā_ of Transoxiana is _Pterocles arenarius_, Pallas's\r\nblack-bellied sand-grouse and that the Indian one is a smaller\r\nsand-grouse, perhaps a _Syrrhaptes_. As the _qīl qūyirūgh_ resembles the\r\nother two, it may be a yet smaller _Syrrhaptes_.\r\n\r\nMuḥ. Ṣāliḥ, writing of sport Shaibāq Khān had in Qarshī\r\n(_Shaibānī-nāma_, Vambéry, p. 192) mentions the 'Little bird (_murghak_)\r\nof Qarshī,' as on all sides making lament. The Sang-lākh[2756] gives its\r\nPersian name as _khar-pala_, ass-hair, says it flies in large flocks\r\nand resembles the _bāghrī qarā_. Of the latter he writes as abundant in\r\nthe open country and as making noise (_bāghīr_).\r\n\r\nThe Sang-lākh (f. 119) gives the earliest and most informing account we\r\nhave found of the _bāghrī qarā_. Its says the bird is larger than a\r\npigeon, marked with various colours, yellow especially, black-breasted\r\nand a dweller in the stony and waterless desert. These details are\r\nfollowed by a quotation from `Alī-sher _Nawā'ī_, in which he likens his\r\nown heart to that of the bird of the desert, presumably referring to the\r\ngloom of the bird's plumage. Three synonyms are then given; Ar. _qiṯā_,\r\none due to its cry (Meninsky); Pers. _sang-shikan_, stone-eating,\r\n(Steingass, _sang-khwāra_, stone-eating); and Turkī _bāghīr-tīlāq_ which\r\nrefers, I think, to its cry.\r\n\r\nMorier (Ḥājī Bābā) in his _Second journey through Persia_ (Lond. 1818,\r\np. 181), mentions that a bird he calls the black-breasted partridge,\r\n(_i.e._ _Francolinus vulgaris_) is known in Turkish as _bokara kara_ and\r\nin Persian as _siyāh-sīna_, both names, (he says), meaning black-breast;\r\nthat it has a horse-shoe of black feathers round the forepart of the\r\ntrunk, more strongly marked in the female than in the male; that they\r\nfly in flocks of which he saw immense numbers near Tabrīz (p. 283), have\r\na soft note, inhabit the plains, and, once settled, do not run. Cock and\r\nhen alike have a small spur,—a characteristic, it may be said,\r\nidentifying rather with _Francolinus vulgaris_ than with _Pterocles\r\narenarius_. Against this identification, however, is Mr. Blandford's\r\nstatement that _siyāh-sīna_ (Morier's _bokara kara_) is _Pterocles\r\narenarius_ (Report of the Persian Boundary Commission, ii, 271).\r\n\r\nIn Afghānistān and Bikanir, the sand-grouse is called _tūtūrak_ and\r\n_boora kurra_ (Jerdon, ii, 498). Scully explains _baghītāq_ as\r\n_Pterocles arenarius_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may mention something making me doubt whether it is correct to\r\ntranslate _bāghrī qarā_ by _black-liver_ and _gorge-noir_ or other names\r\nin which the same meaning is expressed. To translate thus, is to\r\nunderstand a Turkī noun and adjective in Persian construction, and to\r\nmake exception to the rule, amply exemplified in lists of birds, that\r\nTurkī names of birds are commonly in Turkī construction, _e.g._ _qarā\r\nbāsh_ (black-head), _āq-bāsh_ (white-head), _sārīgh-sūndūk_\r\n(yellow-headed wagtail). _Bāghīr_ may refer to the cry of the bird. We\r\nlearn from Mr. Ogilvie Grant that the Mongol name for the sand-grouse\r\n_njūpterjūn_, is derived from its cry in flight, _truck_, _truck_, and\r\nits Arabic name _qiṯā_ is said by Meninsky to be derived from its cry\r\n_kaetha_, _kaetha_. Though the dissimilarity of the two cries is against\r\ntaking the _njūpterjūn_ and the _qiṯā_ to be of one class of\r\nsand-grouse, the significance of the derivation of the names remains,\r\nand shows that there are examples in support of thinking that when a\r\nsand-grouse is known as _bāghrī qarā_, it may be so known because of its\r\ncry (_bāghir_).\r\n\r\nThe word _qarā_ finds suggestive interpretation in a B. N. phrase (f.\r\n72_b_) _Taṃbal-nīng qarā-sī_, Taṃbal's blackness, _i.e._ the dark mass\r\nof his moving men, seen at a distance. It is used also for an indefinite\r\nnumber, _e.g._ 'family, servants, retainers, followers, _qarā_,' and I\r\nthink it may imply a massed flock.\r\n\r\nBābur's words (f. 280) _bāghrī-nīng qarā-sī ham kam dūr_, [its belly\r\n(lit. liver) also is less black], do not necessarily contradict the view\r\nthat the word _bāghrī_ in the bird's name means crying. The root _bāgh_\r\nhas many and pliable derivatives; I suspect both Bābur (here) and Muḥ.\r\nṢāliḥ (l. c.) of ringing changes on words.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted for kind reply to our questions to Mr. Douglas\r\nCarruthers, Mr. Ogilvie Grant and to our friend, Mr. R. S. Whiteway.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.—ON THE GOSHA-GĪR.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to my husband's examination of two Persian MSS. on\r\narchery for an explanation of the word _gosha-gīr_, in its technical\r\nsense in archery. The works consulted are the Cyclopædia of\r\nArchery (_Kulliyatu'r-rāmī_ I. O. 2771) and the Archer's Guide\r\n(_Hidāyatu'r-rāmī_ I. O. 2768).\r\n\r\nIt should be premised that in archery, the word _gosha_ describes, in\r\nthe arrow, the notch by which it grips and can be carried on the string,\r\nand, in the bow, both the tip (horn) and the notch near the tip in which\r\nthe string catches. It is explained by Vullers as _cornu et crena arcûs\r\ncui immititur nervus_.\r\n\r\nTwo passages in the Cyclopædia of Archery (f. 9 and f. 36_b_) shew\r\n_gosha_ as the bow-tip. One says that to bend the bow, two men must\r\ngrasp the two _gosha_; the other reports a tradition that the Archangel\r\nGabriel brought a bow having its two _gosha_ (tips) made of ruby. The\r\nsame book directs that the _gosha_ be made of seasoned ivory, the\r\nArcher's Guide prescribing seasoned mulberry wood.\r\n\r\nThe C. of A. (f. 125_b_) says that a bowman should never be without two\r\nthings, his arrows and his _gosha-gīr_. The _gosha-gīr_ may be called an\r\nitem of the repairing kit; it is an implement (f. 53) for making good a\r\nwarped bow-tip and for holding the string into a displaced notch. It is\r\nknown also as the _chaprās_, brooch or buckle, and the _kardāng_; and is\r\nsaid to bear these names because it fastens in the string. Its shape is\r\nthat of the upper part of the Ar. letter _jīm_, two converging lines of\r\nwhich the lower curves slightly outward. It serves to make good a warped\r\nbow, without the use of fire and it should be kept upon the bow-tip till\r\nthis has reverted to its original state. Until the warp has been\r\nstraightened by the _gosha-gīr_, the bow must be kept from the action of\r\nfire because it, (composite of sinew and glutinous substance,) is of the\r\nnature of wax.\r\n\r\nThe same implement can be used to straighten the middle of the bow, the\r\n_kamān khāna_. It is then called _kar-dāng_. It can be used there on\r\ncondition that there are not two _daur_ (curves) in the bow. If there\r\nare two the bow cannot be repaired without fire. The _halāl daur_ is\r\nsaid to be characteristic of the Turkish bow. There are three _daur_. I\r\nam indebted to Mr. Inigo Simon for the suggestions that _daur_ in this\r\nconnection means _warp_ and that the three twists (_daur_) may be those\r\nof one horn (_gosha_), of the whole bow warped in one curve, and of the\r\ntwo horns warped in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nOf repair to the _kamān-khāna_ it is said further that if no _kardāng_\r\nbe available, its work can be done by means of a stick and string, and\r\nif the damage be slight only, the bow and the string can be tightly tied\r\ntogether till the bow comes straight. 'And the cure is with God!'\r\n\r\nBoth manuscripts named contain much technical information. Some parts of\r\nthis are included in my husband's article, _Oriental Crossbows_ (A. Q.\r\nR. 1911, p. 1). Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey's interesting book on the\r\nCross-bow allows insight into the fine handicraft of Turkish bow-making.\r\n\r\n\r\nD.—ON THE RESCUE PASSAGE.\r\n\r\nI have omitted from my translation an account of Bābur's rescue from\r\nexpected death, although it is with the Ḥaidarābād Codex, because closer\r\nacquaintance with its details has led both my husband and myself to\r\njudge it spurious. We had welcomed it because, being with the true\r\nBābur-nāma text, it accredited the same account found in the\r\nKehr-Ilminsky text, and also because, however inefficiently, it did\r\nsomething towards filling the gap found elsewhere within 908 AH.\r\n\r\nIt is in the Ḥaidarābād MS. (f. 118_b_), in Kehr's MS. (p. 385), in\r\nIlminsky's imprint (p. 144), in _Les Mémoires de Bābour_ (i, 255) and\r\nwith the St. P. University Codex, which is a copy of Kehr's.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is not with the Elphinstone Codex (f. 89_b_); that\r\nit was not with the archetype of that codex the scribe's note shews (f.\r\n90); it is with neither of the _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_ (Pers. translations)\r\nnor with Leyden and Erskine's _Memoirs_ (p. 122).[2757]\r\n\r\nBefore giving our grounds for rejecting what has been offered to fill\r\nthe gap of 908 AH. a few words must be said about the lacuna itself.\r\nNothing indicates that Bābur left it and, since both in the Elphinstone\r\nCodex and its archetype, the sentence preceding it lacks the terminal\r\nverb, it seems due merely to loss of pages. That the loss, if any, was\r\nof early date is clear,—the Elph. MS. itself being copied not later than\r\n1567 AD. (JRAS. 1907, p. 137).\r\n\r\nTwo known circumstances, both of earlier date than that of the\r\nElphinstone Codex, might have led to the loss,—the first is the storm\r\nwhich in 935 AH. scattered Bābur's papers (f. 376_b_), the second, the\r\nvicissitudes to which Humāyūn's library was exposed in his exile.[2758]\r\nOf the two the first seems the more probable cause.\r\n\r\nThe rupture of a story at a point so critical as that of Bābur's danger\r\nin Karnān would tempt to its completion; so too would wish to make good\r\nthe composed part of the Bābur-nāma. Humāyūn annotated the archetype of\r\nthe Elphinstone Codex a good deal but he cannot have written the Rescue\r\npassage if only because he was in a position to avoid some of its\r\ninaccuracies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTEXT AND TRANSLATION OF THE RESCUE PASSAGE.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate reference, I quote the last words preceding the gap\r\npurported to be filled by the Rescue passage, from several texts;—\r\n\r\n(_a_) Elphinstone MS. f. 89_b_,—_Qūptūm. Bāgh gosha-sī-gha bārdīm. Aūzūm\r\nbīla andesha qīldīm. Dīdīm kīm kīshī agar yūz u agar mīng yāshāsā, ākhir\r\nhech...._\r\n\r\n(_b_) The Ḥai. MS. (f. 118_b_) varies from the Elphinstone by omitting\r\nthe word _hech_ and adding _aūlmāk kīrāk_, he must die.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Pāyanda-ḥasan's _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_ (I. O. 215, f.\r\n96_b_),—_Barkhwāstam u dar gosha-i bāgh raftam. Ba khūd andesha karda,\r\nguftam kah agar kase ṣad sāl yā hazār sāl `umr dāshta bāshad, ākhir hech\r\nast._ (It will be seen that this text has the _hech_ of the Elph. MS.)\r\n\r\n(_d_) `Abdu'r-raḥīm's _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_ (I. O. 217, f.\r\n79),—_Barkhwāstam u ba gosha-i-bāgh raftam. Ba khūd andeshīdam u guftam\r\nkah agar kase ṣad sāl u agar hazār sāl `umr bayābad ākhir...._\r\n\r\n(_e_) Muḥ. _Shīrāzī's_ lith. ed. (p. 75) finishes the sentence with\r\n_ākhir khūd bāyad murd_, at last one must die,—varying as it frequently\r\ndoes, from both of the _Wāqi`āt_.\r\n\r\n(_f_) Kehr's MS. (p. 383-454), Ilminsky, p. 144,—_Qūpūb bāghnīng bīr\r\nbūrjī-ghā bārīb, khāṯirīm-ghā kīltūrdīm kīm agar adam yūz yīl u agar\r\nmīng yīl tīrīk būlsā, ākhir aūlmāk dīn aūzkā chāra yūq tūr._ (I rose.\r\nHaving gone to a tower of the garden, I brought it to my mind that if a\r\nperson be alive 100 years or a thousand years, at last he has no help\r\nother than to die.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rescue passage is introduced by a Persian couplet, identified by my\r\nhusband as from Niẕāmī's _Khusrau u Shīrīn_, which is as follows;—\r\n\r\n     If you stay a hundred years, and if one year,\r\n     Forth you must go from this heart-delighting palace.\r\n\r\n   I steadied myself for death (_qarār bīrdīm_). In that garden a stream\r\n   came flowing;[2759] I made ablution; I recited the prayer of two\r\n   inclinations (_ra`kat_); having raised my head for silent prayer, I\r\n   was making earnest petition when my eyes closed in sleep.[2760] I am\r\n   seeing[2761] that Khwāja Yaq`ūb, the son of Khwāja Yaḥyā and\r\n   grandson of His Highness Khwāja `Ubaidu'l-lāh, came facing me,\r\n   mounted on a piebald horse, with a large company of piebald horsemen\r\n   (_sic_).[2762] He said: 'Lay sorrow aside! Khwāja _Aḥrār_ (_i.e._\r\n   `Ubaidu'l-lāh) has sent me to you; he said, \"We, having asked help\r\n   for him (_i.e._ Bābur), will seat him on the royal throne;[2763]\r\n   wherever difficulty befalls him, let him look towards us (lit. bring\r\n   us to sight) and call us to mind; there will we be present.\" Now, in\r\n   this hour, victory and success are on your side; lift up your head!\r\n   awake!'\r\n\r\n   At that time I awoke happy, when Yūsuf and those with him[2764] were\r\n   giving one another advice. 'We will make a pretext to deceive; to\r\n   seize and bind[2765] is necessary.' Hearing these words, I said,\r\n   'Your words are of this sort, but I will see which of you will come\r\n   to my presence to take me.' I was saying this when outside the garden\r\n   wall[2766] came the noise of approaching horsemen. Yūsuf _darogha_\r\n   said, 'If we had taken you to Taṃbal our affairs would have gone\r\n   forward. Now he has sent again many persons to seize you.' He was\r\n   certain that this noise might be the footfall of the horses of those\r\n   sent by Taṃbal. On hearing those words anxiety grew upon me; what to\r\n   do I did not know. At this time those horsemen, not happening to find\r\n   the garden gate, broke down the wall where it was old (and) came in.\r\n   I saw (_kūrsām_, lit. might see) that Qutluq Muḥ. _Barlās_ and Bābā-i\r\n   _Pargharī_, my life-devoted servants, having arrived [with], it may\r\n   be, ten, fifteen, twenty persons, were approaching. Having flung\r\n   themselves from their horses,[2767] bent the knee from afar and\r\n   showed respect, they fell at my feet. In that state (_ḥal_) such\r\n   ecstasy (_ḥāl_) came over me that you might say (_goyā_) God gave me\r\n   life from a new source (_bāsh_). I said, 'Seize and bind that Yūsuf\r\n   _darogha_ and these here (_tūrghān_) hireling mannikins.' These same\r\n   mannikins had taken to flight. They (_i.e._ the rescuers), having\r\n   taken them, one by one, here and there, brought them bound. I said,\r\n   'Where do you come from? How did you get news?' Qutluq Muḥ. _Barlās_\r\n   said: 'When, having fled from Akhsī, we were separated from you in\r\n   the flight, we went to Andijān when the Khāns also came to Andijān. I\r\n   saw a vision that Khwāja `Ubaidu'l-lāh said, \"Bābur _pādshāh_[2768]\r\n   is in a village called Karnān; go and bring him, since the royal seat\r\n   (_masnad_) has become his possession (_ta`alluq_).\" I having seen\r\n   this vision and become happy, represented (the matter) to the Elder\r\n   Khān (and) the Younger Khān. I said to the Khāns, \"I have five or six\r\n   younger brothers (and) sons; do you add a few soldiers. I will go\r\n   through the Karnān side and bring news.\" The Khāns said, \"It occurs\r\n   to our minds also that (he) may have gone that same road (?).\" They\r\n   appointed ten persons; they said, \"Having gone in that direction\r\n   (_sārī_) and made very sure, bring news. Would to God you might get\r\n   true news!\" We were saying this when Bābā-i _Parghārī_ said, \"I too\r\n   will go and seek.\" He also having agreed with two young men, (his)\r\n   younger brothers, we rode out. It is three days to-day that we are\r\n   on the road. Thank God! we have found you.' They said (_dīdīlār_, for\r\n   _dīb_). They spoke (_aītīlār_), 'Make a move! Ride off! Take these\r\n   bound ones with you! To stay here is not well; Taṃbal has had news of\r\n   your coming here; go, in whatever way, and join yourself to the\r\n   Khāns!' At that time we having ridden out, moved towards Andijān. It\r\n   was two days that we had eaten no food; the evening prayer had come\r\n   when we found a sheep, went on, dismounted, killed, and roasted. Of\r\n   that same roast we ate as much as a feast. After that we rode on,\r\n   hurried forward, made a five days' journey in a day and two nights,\r\n   came and entered Andijān. I saluted my uncle the Elder Khān (and) my\r\n   uncle the Younger Khān, and made recital of past days. With the Khāns\r\n   I spent four months. My servants, who had gone looking in every\r\n   place, gathered themselves together; there were more than 300\r\n   persons. It came to my mind (_kīm_), 'How long must I wander, a\r\n   vagabond (_sar-gardān_),[2769] in this Farghāna country? I will make\r\n   search (_ṯalab_) on every side (_dīb_).' Having said, I rode out in\r\n   the month of Muḥarram to seek Khurāsān, and I went out from the\r\n   country of Farghāna.[2770]\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AGAINST THE REJECTION OF THE RESCUE PASSAGE.\r\n\r\nTwo circumstances have weight against rejecting the passage, its\r\npresence with the Ḥaidarābād Codex and its acceptance by Dr. Ilminsky\r\nand M. de Courteille.\r\n\r\nThat it is with the Codex is a matter needing consideration and this the\r\nmore that it is the only extra matter there found. Not being with the\r\nPersian translations, it cannot be of early date. It seems likely to owe\r\nits place of honour to distinguished authorship and may well be one of\r\nthe four portions (_juzwe_) mentioned by Jahāngīr in the\r\nTuzūk-i-jahāngīrī,[2771] as added by himself to his ancestor's book. If\r\nso, it may be mentioned, it will have been with Bābur's autograph MS.\r\n[now not to be found], from which the Ḥaidarābād Codex shews signs of\r\nbeing a direct copy.[2772]\r\n\r\n[The incongruity of the Rescue passage with the true text has been\r\nindicated by foot-notes to the translation of it already given. What\r\ncondemns it on historic and other grounds will follow.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn linguistic grounds it is a strong argument in its favour that Dr.\r\nIlminsky and M. de Courteille should have accepted it but the argument\r\nloses weight when some of the circumstances of their work are taken into\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is not strictly accurate to regard Dr. Ilminsky\r\nas accepting it unquestioned, because it is covered by his depreciatory\r\nremarks, made in his preface, on Kehr's text. He, like M. de Courteille,\r\nworked with a single Turkī MS. and neither of the two ever saw a\r\ncomplete true text. When their source (the Kehr-Ilminsky) was able to be\r\ncollated with the Elph. and Ḥai. MSS. much and singular divergence was\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nI venture to suggest what appears to me to explain M. de Courteille's\r\nacceptance of the Rescue passage. Down to its insertion, the\r\nKehr-Ilminsky text is so continuously and so curiously corrupt that it\r\nseems necessary to regard it as being a re-translation into Turkī from\r\none of the Persian translations of the _Bābur-nāma_. There being these\r\ntextual defects in it, it would create on the mind of a reader initiated\r\nthrough it, only, in the book, an incorrect impression of Bābur's style\r\nand vocabulary, and such a reader would feel no transition when passing\r\non from it to the Rescue passage.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this explanation, it might be said that a wrong\r\nstandard set up by the corrupt text, would or could be changed by the\r\nexcellence of later parts of the Kehr-Ilminsky one. In words, this is\r\nsound, no doubt, and such reflex criticism is now easy, but more than\r\nthe one defective MS. was wanted even to suggest the need of such reflex\r\ncriticism. The _Bābur-nāma_ is lengthy, ponderous to poise and grasp,\r\nand work on it is still tentative, even with the literary gains since\r\nthe Seventies.\r\n\r\nFew of the grounds which weigh with us for the rejection of the Rescue\r\npassage were known to Dr. Ilminsky or M. de Courteille;—the two good\r\nCodices bring each its own and varied help; Teufel's critique on the\r\n'Fragments,' though made without acquaintance with those adjuncts as\r\nthey stand in Kehr's own volume, is of much collateral value; several\r\nuseful oriental histories seem not to have been available for M. de\r\nCourteille's use. I may add, for my own part, that I have the great\r\nadvantage of my husband's companionship and the guidance of his wide\r\nacquaintance with related oriental books. In truth, looking at the\r\ndrawbacks now removed, an earlier acceptance of the passage appears as\r\nnatural as does today's rejection.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUNDS FOR REJECTING THE RESCUE PASSAGE.\r\n\r\nThe grounds for rejecting the passage need here little more than\r\nrecapitulation from my husband's article in the JASB. 1910, p. 221, and\r\nare as follows;—\r\n\r\n   i. The passage is in neither of the _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_.\r\n\r\n   ii. The dreams detailed are too à propos and marvellous for\r\n   credence.\r\n\r\n   iii. Khwāja Yaḥyā is not known to have had a son, named\r\n   Ya`qūb.\r\n\r\n   iv. The _Bābur-nāma_ does not contain the names assigned to\r\n   the rescuers.\r\n\r\n   v. The Khāns were not in Andijān and Bābur did not go there.\r\n\r\n   vi. He did not set out for Khurāsān after spending 4 months\r\n   with The Khāns but after Aḥmad's death (end of 909 AH.), while\r\n   Maḥmud was still in Eastern Turkistān and after about a year's\r\n   stay in Sūkh.\r\n\r\n   vii. The followers who gathered to him were not 'more than\r\n   300' but between 2 and 300.\r\n\r\n   viii. The '3 days,' and the 'day and two nights,' and the '5\r\n   days' journey was one of some 70 miles, and one recorded as\r\n   made in far less time.\r\n\r\n   ix. The passage is singularly inadequate to fill a gap of 14\r\n   to 16 months, during which events of the first importance\r\n   occurred to Bābur and to the Chaghatāī dynasty.\r\n\r\n   x. Khwāja _Aḥrārī's_ promises did nothing to fulfil Bābur's\r\n   wishes for 908 AH. while those of Ya`qūb for immediate victory\r\n   were closely followed by defeat and exile. Bābur knew the\r\n   facts; the passage cannot be his. It looks as though the\r\n   writer saw Bābur in Karnān across Tīmūrid success in\r\n   Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n   xi. The style and wording of the passage are not in harmony\r\n   with those of the true text.\r\n\r\nOther reasons for rejection are marked change in choice of the details\r\nchosen for commemoration, _e.g._ when Bābur mentions prayer, he does so\r\nsimply; when he tells a dream, it seems a real one. The passage leaves\r\nthe impression that the writer did not think in Turkī, composed in it\r\nwith difficulty, and looked at life from another view-point than\r\nBābur's.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn these various grounds, we have come to the conclusion that it is no\r\npart of the _Bābur-nāma_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[APPENDICES TO THE KĀBUL SECTION.]\r\n\r\nE.—NAGARAHĀR, AND NĪNG-NAHĀR\r\n\r\nThose who consult books and maps about the riverain tract between the\r\nSafed-koh (Spīn-ghur) and (Anglicé) the Kābul-river find its name in\r\nseveral forms, the most common being Nangrahār and Nangnahār (with\r\nvariant vowels). It would be useful to establish a European book-name\r\nfor the district. As European opinion differs about the origin and\r\nmeaning of the names now in use, and as a good deal of interesting\r\ncircumstance gathers round the small problem of a correct form (there\r\nmay be two), I offer about the matter what has come into the restricted\r\nfield of my own work, premising that I do this merely as one who drops a\r\ncasual pebble on the cairn of observation already long rising for\r\nscholarly examination.\r\n\r\n_a. The origin and meaning of the names._\r\n\r\nI have met with three opinions about the origin and meaning of the names\r\nfound now and earlier. To each one of them obvious objection can be\r\nmade. They are:—\r\n\r\n   1. That all forms now in use are corruptions of the Sanscrit\r\n   word Nagarahāra, the name of the Town-of-towns which in the\r\n   _dū-āb_ of the Bārān-sū and Sūrkh-rūd left the ruins Masson\r\n   describes in Wilson's _Ariana Antigua_. But if this is so, why\r\n   is the Town-of-towns multiplied into the nine of Na-nagrahār\r\n   (Nangrahār)?[2773]\r\n\r\n   2. That the names found represent Sanscrit _nawā vihāra_, nine\r\n   monasteries, an opinion the Gazetteer of India of 1907 has\r\n   adopted from Bellew. But why precisely nine monasteries? Nine\r\n   appears an understatement.\r\n\r\n   3. That Nang (Ning or Nung) -nahār verbally means nine\r\n   streams, (Bābur's Tūqūz-rūd,) an interpretation of long\r\n   standing (Section _b infra_). But whence _nang_, _ning_,\r\n   _nung_, for nine? Such forms are not in Persian, Turkī or\r\n   Pushtu dictionaries, and, as Sir G. A. Grierson assures me, do\r\n   not come into the Linguistic Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. On nang, ning, nung for nine._\r\n\r\nSpite of their absence from the natural homes of words, however, the\r\nabove sounds have been heard and recorded as symbols of the number nine\r\nby careful men through a long space of time.\r\n\r\nThe following instances of the use of \"Nangnahār\" show this, and also\r\nshow that behind the variant forms there may be not a single word but\r\ntwo of distinct origin and sense.\r\n\r\n   1. In Chinese annals two names appear as those of the district\r\n   and town (I am not able to allocate their application with\r\n   certainty). The first is Na-kie-lo-ho-lo, the second\r\n   Nang-g-lo-ho-lo and these, I understand to represent\r\n   Nagara-hāra and Nang-nahār, due allowance being made for\r\n   Chinese idiosyncrasy.[2774]\r\n\r\n   2. Some 900 years later (1527-30 AD.) Bābur also gives two\r\n   names, Nagarahār (as the book-name of his _tūmān_) and\r\n   Nīng-nahār.[2775] He says the first is found in several\r\n   histories (B.N. f. 131_b_); the second will have been what he\r\n   heard and also presumably what appeared in revenue accounts;\r\n   of it he says, \"it is nine torrents\" (_tūqūz-rūd_).\r\n\r\n   3. Some 300 years after Bābur, Elphinstone gives two names\r\n   for the district, neither of them being Bābur's book-name,\r\n   \"Nangrahaur[2776] or Nungnahaur, from the nine streams which\r\n   issue from the Safed-koh, _nung_ in Pushtoo signifying _nine_,\r\n   and _nahaura_, a stream\" (_Caubul_, i, 160).\r\n\r\n   4. In 1881 Colonel H. S. Tanner had heard, in Nūr-valley on\r\n   the north side of the Kābul-water, that the name of the\r\n   opposite district was Nīng-nahār and its meaning Nine-streams.\r\n   He did not get a list of the nine and all he heard named do\r\n   not flow from Safed-koh.\r\n\r\n   5. In 1884 Colonel H. G. McGregor gives two names with their\r\n   explanation, \"Ningrahar and Nungnihar; the former is a\r\n   corruption of the latter word[2777] which in the Afghān\r\n   language signifies nine rivers or rivulets.\" He names nine,\r\n   but of them six only issue from Safed-koh.\r\n\r\n   6. I have come across the following instances in which the\r\n   number nine is represented by other words than _na_ (_ni_ or\r\n   _nu_); _viz._ the _nenhan_ of the Chitrālī Kāfir and the\r\n   _noun_ of the Panjābi, recorded by Leech,—the _nyon_ of the\r\n   Khowārī and the _huncha_ of the Boorishki, recorded by Colonel\r\n   Biddulph.\r\n\r\nThe above instances allow opinion that in the region concerned and\r\nthrough a long period of time, nine has been expressed by _nang_ (_ning_\r\nor _nung_) and other nasal or high palatal sounds, side by side with\r\n_na_ (_ni_ or _nu_). The whole matter may be one of nasal\r\nutterance,[2778] but since a large number of tribesmen express nine by a\r\nword containing a nasal sound, should that word not find place in lists\r\nof recognized symbols of sounds?\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Are there two names of distinct origin?_\r\n\r\n1. Certainly it makes a well-connected story of decay in the Sanscrit\r\nword Nagarahāra to suppose that tribesmen, prone by their organism to\r\nnasal utterance, pronounced that word Nangrahār, and by force of their\r\nnumbers made this corruption current,—that this was recognized as the\r\nname of the town while the Town-of-towns was great or in men's memory,\r\nand that when through the decay of the town its name became a\r\nmeaningless husk, the wrong meaning of the Nine-streams should enter\r\ninto possession.\r\n\r\nBut as another and better one can be put together, this fair-seeming\r\nstory may be baseless. Its substitute has the advantage of explaining\r\nthe double sequence of names shown in Section _b_.\r\n\r\nThe second story makes all the variant names represent one or other of\r\ntwo distinct originals. It leaves Nagrahār to represent Nagarahāra, the\r\ndead town; it makes the nine torrents of Safed-koh the primeval sponsors\r\nof Nīng-nahār, the name of the riverain tract. Both names, it makes\r\ncontemporary in the relatively brief interlude of the life of the town.\r\nFor the fertilizing streams will have been the dominant factors of\r\nsettlement and of revenue from the earliest times of population and\r\ngovernment. They arrest the eye where they and their ribbons of\r\ncultivation space the riverain waste; they are obvious units for\r\ngrouping into a sub-government. Their name has a counterpart in adjacent\r\nPanj-āb; the two may have been given by one dominant power, how long\r\nago, in what tongue matters not. The riverain tract, by virtue of its\r\nplace on a highway of transit, must have been inhabited long before the\r\ntown Nagarahāra was built, and must have been known by a name. What\r\nbetter one than Nine-streams can be thought of?\r\n\r\n2. Bellew is quoted by the Gazetteer of India (ed. 1907) as saying, in\r\nhis argument in favour of _nawā vihāra_, that no nine streams are found\r\nto stand sponsor, but modern maps shew nine outflows from Safed-koh to\r\nthe Kābul-river between the Sūrkh-rūd and Daka, while if affluents to\r\nthe former stream be reckoned, more than nine issue from the\r\nrange.[2779]\r\n\r\nAgainst Bellew's view that there are not nine streams, is the long\r\npersistence of the number nine in the popular name (Sect. _b_).\r\n\r\nIt is also against his view that he supposes there were nine\r\nmonasteries, because each of the nine must have had its fertilizing\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBābur says there were nine; there must have been nine of significance;\r\nhe knew his _tūmān_ not only by frequent transit but by his revenue\r\naccounts. A supporting point in those accounts is likely to have been\r\nthat the individual names of the villages on the nine streams would\r\nappear, with each its payment of revenue.\r\n\r\n3. In this also is some weight of circumstance against taking Nagarahāra\r\nto be the parent of Nīng-nahār:—An earlier name of the town is said to\r\nbe Udyānapūra, Garden town.[2780] Of this Bābur's Adīnapūr is held to be\r\na corruption; the same meaning of garden has survived on approximately\r\nthe same ground in Bālā-bāgh and Roẓābād.\r\n\r\nNagarahāra is seen, therefore, to be a parenthetical name between others\r\nwhich are all derived from gardens. It may shew the promotion of a\r\n\"Garden-town\" to a \"Chief-town\". If it did this, there was relapse of\r\nname when the Chief-town lost status. Was it ever applied beyond the\r\ndelta? If it were, would it, when dead in the delta, persist along the\r\nriverain tract? If it were not, _cadit quæstio_; the suggestion of two\r\nnames distinct in origin, is upheld.\r\n\r\nCertainly the riverain tract would fall naturally under the government\r\nof any town flourishing in the delta, the richest and most populous part\r\nof the region. But for this very reason it must have had a name older\r\nthan parenthetical Nagarahāra. That inevitable name would be\r\nappropriately Nīng-nahār (or Na-nahār) Nine-streams; and for a period\r\nNagarahāra would be the Chief-town of the district of Na-nahār\r\n(Nine-streams).[2781]\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. Bābur's statements about the name._\r\n\r\nWhat the cautious Bābur says of his _tūmān_ of Nīng-nahār has weight:—\r\n\r\n   1. That some histories write it Nagarahār (Ḥaidarābād Codex,\r\n   f. 131_b_);\r\n\r\n   2. That Nīng-nahār is nine torrents, _i.e._ mountain streams,\r\n   _tūquz-rud_;\r\n\r\n   3. That (the) nine torrents issue from Safed-koh (f. 132_b_).\r\n\r\nOf his first statement can be said, that he will have seen the book-name\r\nin histories he read, but will have heard Nīng-nahār, probably also have\r\nseen it in current letters and accounts.\r\n\r\nOf his second,—that it bears and may be meant to bear two senses, (_a_)\r\nthat the _tūmān_ consisted of nine torrents,—their lands implied; just\r\nas he says \"Asfara is four _būlūks_\" (sub-divisions f. 3_b_)—(_b_) that\r\n_tūqūz rūd_ translates _nīng-nahār_.\r\n\r\nOf his third,—that in English its sense varies as it is read with or\r\nwithout the definite article Turkī rarely writes, but that either sense\r\nhelps out his first and second, to mean that verbally and by its\r\nconstituent units Nīng-nahār is nine-torrents; as verbally and by its\r\nconstituents Panj-āb is five-waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. Last words._\r\n\r\nDetailed work on the Kābul section of the _Bābur-nāma_ has stamped two\r\nimpressions so deeply on me, that they claim mention, not as novel or as\r\nspecial to myself, but as set by the work.\r\n\r\nThe first is of extreme risk in swift decision on any problem of words\r\narising in North Afghānistān, because of its local concourse of tongues,\r\nthe varied utterance of its unlettered tribes resident or nomad, and the\r\nfrequent translation of proper names in obedience to their verbal\r\nmeanings. Names lie there too in _strata_, relics of successive\r\noccupation—Greek, Turkī, Hindī, Pushtū and tribes _galore_.\r\n\r\nThe second is that the region is an exceptionally fruitful field for\r\nfirst-hand observation of speech, the movent ocean of the uttered word,\r\nfree of the desiccated symbolism of alphabets and books.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books, amongst others, have prompted the above note:—\r\n\r\n   Ghoswāra Inscription, Kittoe, JASB., 1848, and Kielhorn,\r\n   _Indian Antiquary_, 1888, p. 311.\r\n\r\n   H.

Jalalābād.\r\n\r\n   Bellew's _Races of Afghānistān_.\r\n\r\n\r\nF.—ON THE NAME DARA-I-NŪR\r\n\r\nSome European writers have understood the name Dara-i-nūr to mean Valley\r\nof Light, but natural features and also the artificial one mentioned by\r\nColonel H. G. Tanner (_infra_), make it better to read the component\r\n_nūr_, not as Persian _nūr_, light, but as Pushtū _nūr_, rock. Hence it\r\ntranslates as Valley of Rocks, or Rock-valley. The region in which the\r\nvalley lies is rocky and boulder-strewn; its own waters flow to the\r\nKābul-river east of the water of Chitrāl. It shews other names composed\r\nwith _nūr_, in which _nūr_ suits if it means rock, but is inexplicable\r\nif it means light, _e.g._ Nūr-lām (Nūr-fort), the master-fort in the\r\nmouth of Nūr-valley, standing high on a rock between two streams, as\r\nBābur and Tanner have both described it from eye-witness,—Nūr-gal\r\n(village), a little to the north-west of the valley,—Aūlūgh-nūr (great\r\nrock), at a crossing mentioned by Bābur, higher up the Bārān-water,—and\r\nKoh-i-nūr (Rocky-mountains), which there is ground for taking as the\r\ncorrect form of the familiar \"Kunar\" of some European writers (Raverty's\r\n_Notes_, p. 106). The dominant feature in these places dictates reading\r\n_nūr_ as rock; so too the work done in Nūr-valley with boulders, of\r\nwhich Colonel H. G. Tanner's interesting account is subjoined (P.R.G.S.\r\n1881, p. 284).\r\n\r\n\"Some 10 miles from the source of the main stream of the Nur-valley the\r\nDameneh stream enters, but the waters of the two never meet; they flow\r\nside by side about three-quarters of a mile apart for about 12 miles and\r\nempty themselves into the Kunar river by different mouths, each torrent\r\nhugging closely the foot of the hills at its own side of the valley.\r\nNow, except in countries where terracing has been practised continuously\r\nfor thousands of years, such unnatural topography as exists in the\r\nvalley of Nur is next to impossible. The forces which were sufficient to\r\nscoop out the valley in the first instance, would have kept a water-way\r\nat the lowest part, into which would have poured the drainage of the\r\nsurrounding mountains; but in the Nur-valley long-continued terracing\r\nhas gradually raised the centre of the valley high above the edges. The\r\npopulation has increased to its maximum limit and every available inch\r\nof ground is required for cultivation; the people, by means of\r\nterrace-walls built of ponderous boulders in the bed of the original\r\nsingle stream, have little by little pushed the waters out of their true\r\ncourse, until they run, where now found, in deep rocky cuttings at the\r\nfoot of the hills on either side\" (p. 280).\r\n\r\n\"I should like to go on and say a good deal more about boulders; and\r\nwhile I am about it I may as well mention one that lies back from a\r\nhamlet in Shulut, which is so big that a house is built in a fault or\r\ncrack running across its face. Another pebble lies athwart the village\r\nand covers the whole of the houses from that side.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nG.—ON THE NAMES OF TWO DARA-I-NŪR WINES.\r\n\r\nFrom the two names, Arat-tāshī and Sūhān (Suhār) -tāshī, which Bābur\r\ngives as those of two wines of the Dara-i-nūr, it can be inferred that\r\nhe read _nūr_ to mean rock. For if in them Turkī _tāsh_, rock, be\r\nreplaced by Pushtū _nūr_, rock, two place-names emerge, Arat (-nūrī) and\r\nSūhān (-nūrī), known in the Nūr-valley.\r\n\r\nThese may be villages where the wines were grown, but it would be quite\r\nexceptional for Bābur to say that wines are called from their villages,\r\nor indeed by any name. He says here not where they grow but what they\r\nare called.\r\n\r\nI surmise that he is repeating a joke, perhaps his own, perhaps a\r\nstanding local one, made on the quality of the wines. For whether with\r\n_tāsh_ or with _nūr_ (rock), the names can be translated as Rock-saw and\r\nRock-file, and may refer to the rough and acid quality of the wines,\r\nrasping and setting the teeth on edge as does iron on stone.\r\n\r\nThe villages themselves may owe their names to a serrated edge or\r\nsplintered pinnacle of weathered granite, in which local people, known\r\nas good craftsmen, have seen resemblance to tools of their trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.—ON THE COUNTERMARK BIH BŪD ON COINS.\r\n\r\nAs coins of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā _Bāī-qarā_ and other rulers do actually\r\nbear the words _Bih būd_, Bābur's statement that the name of Bihbūd Beg\r\nwas on the Mīrzā's coins acquires a numismatic interest which may make\r\nserviceable the following particulars concerning the passage and the\r\nbeg.[2782]\r\n\r\n   _a. The Turkī passage_ (Elph. MS. f. 135_b_; Ḥaidarābād Codex\r\n   f. 173_b_; Ilminsky p. 217).\r\n\r\nFor ease of reference the Turkī, Persian and English version are\r\nsubjoined:—\r\n\r\n(1) _Yana Bihbūd Beg aīdī. Būrūnlār chuhra-jīrga-sī-dā khidmat qīlūr\r\naīdī. Mīrzā-nīng qāzāqlīqlārīdā khidmatī bāqīb Bihbūd Beg-kā bū\r\n`ināyatnī qīlīb aīdī kīm tamghā u sikka-dā ānīng ātī aīdī._\r\n\r\n(2) The Persian translation of `Abdu'r-raḥīm (Muḥ. Shīrāzī's lith. ed.\r\np. 110):—\r\n\r\n_Dīgar Bihbūd Beg būd. Auwalhā dar jīrga-i-chuhrahā khidmat mikard. Chūn\r\ndar qāzāqīhā Mīrzārā khidmat karda būd u ānrā mulāḥaẓa namūda, aīnrā\r\n`ināyat karda būd kah dar tamghānāt sikka_[2783] _nām-i-au būd._\r\n\r\n(3) A literal English translation of the Turkī:—\r\n\r\nAnother was Bihbūd Beg. He served formerly in the _chuhra-jīrga-sī_\r\n(corps of braves). Looking to his service in the Mīrzā's guerilla-times,\r\nthe favour had been done to Bihbūd Beg that his name was on the stamp\r\nand coin.[2784]\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Of Bihbūd Beg._\r\n\r\nWe have found little so far to add to what Bābur tells of Bihbūd Beg and\r\nwhat he tells we have not found elsewhere. The likely sources of his\r\ninformation are Daulat Shāh and Khwānd-amīr who have written at length\r\nof Ḥusain _Bāī-qarā_. Considerable search in the books of both men has\r\nfailed to discover mention of signal service or public honour connected\r\nwith the beg. Bābur may have heard what he tells in Harāt in 912 AH.\r\n(1506 AD.) when he would see Ḥusain's coins presumably; but later\r\nopportunity to see them must have been frequent during his campaigns and\r\nvisits north of Hindū-kush, notably in Balkh.\r\n\r\nThe sole mention we have found of Bihbūd Beg in the _Ḥabību's-siyar_ is\r\nthat he was one of Ḥusain's commanders at the battle of Chīkmān-sarāī\r\nwhich was fought with Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā _Mīrānshāhī_ in Muḥarram 876 AH.\r\n(June-July 1471 AD.).[2785] His place in the list shews him to have had\r\nimportance. \"Amīr Niẕāmu'd-dīn `Alī-sher's brother Darwesh-i-`alī the\r\nlibrarian (_q.v._ Ḥai. Codex Index), and Amīr Bihbūd, and Muḥ. `Alī\r\n_ātāka_, and Bakhshīka and Shāh Walī _Qīpchāq_, and Dost-i-muḥammad\r\n_chuhra_, and Amīr Qul-i-`alī, and\" (another).\r\n\r\nThe total of our information about the man is therefore:—\r\n\r\n(1) That when Ḥusain[2786] from 861 to 873 AH. (1457 to 1469 AD.) was\r\nfighting his way up to the throne of Harāt, Bihbūd served him well in\r\nthe corps of braves, (as many others will have done).\r\n\r\n(2) That he was a beg and one of Ḥusain's commanders in 876 AH. (1471\r\nAD.).\r\n\r\n(3) That Bābur includes him amongst Ḥusain's begs and says of him what\r\nhas been quoted, doing this _circa_ 934 AH. (1528 AD.), some 56 years\r\nafter Khwānd-amīr's mention of him _s.a._ 876 AH. (1471 AD.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Of the term chuhra-jīrga-sī used by Bābur._\r\n\r\nOf this term Bābur supplies an explicit explanation which I have not\r\nfound in European writings. His own book amply exemplifies his\r\nexplanation, as do also Khwānd-amīr's and Ḥaidar's.\r\n\r\nHe gives the explanation (f. 15_b_) when describing a retainer of his\r\nfather's who afterwards became one of his own begs. It is as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"`Alī-darwesh of Khurāsān served in the Khurāsān _chuhra-jīrga-sī_, one\r\nof two special corps (_khāṣa tābīn_) of serviceable braves (_yārār\r\nyīgītlār_) formed by Sl. Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā when he first began to arrange\r\nthe government of Khurāsān and Samarkand and, presumably, called by him\r\nthe Khurāsān corps and the Samarkand corps.\"\r\n\r\nThis shews the circle to have consisted of fighting-men, such\r\nserviceable braves as are frequently mentioned by Bābur; and his words\r\n\"_yārār yīgīt_\" make it safe to say that if instead of using a Persian\r\nphrase, he had used a Turkī one, _yīgīt_, brave would have replaced\r\n_chuhra_, \"young soldier\" (Erskine). A considerable number of men on\r\nactive service are styled _chuhra_, one at least is styled _yīgīt_, in\r\nthe same way as others are styled _beg_.[2787]\r\n\r\nThree military circles are mentioned in the _Bābur-nāma_, consisting\r\nrespectively of braves, household begs (under Bābur's own command), and\r\ngreat begs. Some men are mentioned who never rose from the rank of brave\r\n(_yīgīt_), some who became household-begs, some who went through the\r\nthree grades.\r\n\r\nOf the corps of braves Bābur conveys the information that Abū-sa`īd\r\nfounded it at a date which will have lain between 1451 and 1457 AD.;\r\nthat `Umar Shaikh's man `Alī-darwesh belonged to it; and that Ḥusain's\r\nman Bihbūd did so also. Both men, `Ali-darwesh and Bihbūd, when in its\r\ncircle, would appropriately be styled _chuhra_ as men of the beg-circle\r\nwere styled beg; the Dost-i-muḥammad _chuhra_ who was a commander, (he\r\nwill have had a brave's command,) at Chīkmān-sarāī (_see_ list _supra_)\r\nwill also have been of this circle. Instances of the use by Bābur of the\r\nname _khaṣa-tābīn_ and its equivalent _būītīkīnī_ are shewn on f. 209\r\nand f. 210_b_. A considerable number of Bābur's fighting men, the braves\r\nhe so frequently mentions as sent on service, are styled _chuhra_ and\r\ninferentially belong to the same circle.[2788]\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. Of Bih būd on Ḥusain Bāī-qarā's coins._\r\n\r\nSo far it does not seem safe to accept Bābur's statement literally. He\r\nmay tell a half-truth and obscure the rest by his brevity.\r\n\r\nNothing in the sources shows ground for signal and public honour to\r\nBihbūd Beg, but a good deal would allow surmise that jesting allusion to\r\nhis name might decide for _Bih būd_ as a coin mark when choice had to be\r\nmade of one, in the flush of success, in an assembly of the begs, and,\r\namongst those begs, lovers of word-play and enigma.\r\n\r\nThe personal name is found written Bihbūd, as one word and with medial\r\n_h_; the mark is _Bih būd_ with the terminal _h_ in the _Bih_. There\r\nhave been discussions moreover as to whether to read on the coins _Bih\r\nbūd_, it was good, or _Bih buvad_, let it be, or become, good (valid for\r\ncurrency?).\r\n\r\nThe question presents itself; would the beg's name have appeared on the\r\ncoins, if it had not coincided in form with a suitable coin-mark?\r\n\r\nAgainst literal acceptance of Bābur's statement there is also doubt of a\r\nthing at once so _ben trovato_ and so unsupported by evidence.\r\n\r\nAnother doubt arises from finding _Bih būd_ on coins of other rulers,\r\none of Iskandar Khan's being of a later date,[2789] others, of Tīmūr,\r\nShāhrukh and Abū-sa`īd, with nothing to shew who counterstruck it on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn some of Ḥusain's coins the sentence _Bih būd_ appears as part of the\r\nlegend and not as a counterstrike. This is a good basis for finding a\r\nhalf-truth in Bābur's statement. It does not allow of a whole-truth in\r\nhis statement because, as it is written, it is a coin-mark, not a name.\r\n\r\nAn interesting matter as bearing on Ḥusain's use of _Bih būd_ is that in\r\n865 AH. (1461 AD.) he had an incomparable horse named Bihbūd, one he\r\ngave in return for a falcon on making peace with Mustapha Khān.[2790]\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. Of Bābur's vassal-coinage._\r\n\r\nThe following historical details narrow the field of numismatic\r\nobservation on coins believed struck by Bābur as a vassal of Ismā`īl\r\n_Ṣafawī_. They are offered because not readily accessible.\r\n\r\nThe length of Bābur's second term of rule in Transoxiana was not the\r\nthree solar years of the B.M. Coin Catalogues but did not exceed eight\r\nmonths. He entered Samarkand in the middle of Rajab 917 AH. (_c._ Oct.\r\n1st, 1511 AD.). He returned to it defeated and fled at once, after the\r\nbattle of Kūl-i-malik which was fought in Ṣafar 918 AH. (mid-April to\r\nmid-May 1512 AD.). Previous to the entry he was in the field, without a\r\nfixed base; after his flight he was landless till at the end both of 920\r\nAH. and of 1514 AD. he had returned to Kābul.\r\n\r\nHe would not find a full Treasury in Samarkand because the Aūzbegs\r\nevacuated the fort at their own time; eight months would not give him\r\nlarge tribute in kind. He failed in Transoxiana because he was the ally\r\nof a Shī`a; would coins bearing the Shī`a legend have passed current\r\nfrom a Samarkand mint? These various circumstances suggest that he could\r\nnot have struck many coins of any kind in Samarkand.\r\n\r\nThe coins classed in the B.M. Catalogues as of Bābur's vassalage, offer\r\na point of difficulty to readers of his own writings, inasmuch as\r\nneither the \"Sulṯān Muḥammad\" of No. 652 (gold), nor the \"Sulṯān Bābur\r\nBahādur\" of the silver coins enables confident acceptance of them as\r\nnames he himself would use.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.—ON THE WEEPING-WILLOWS OF f. 190_b_.\r\n\r\nThe passage omitted from f. 190_b_, which seems to describe something\r\ndecorative done with weeping willows, (_bed-i-mawallah_) has been\r\ndifficult to all translators. This may be due to inaccurate pointing in\r\nBābur's original MS. or may be what a traveller seeing other willows at\r\nanother feast could explain.\r\n\r\nThe first Persian translation omits the passage (I.O. 215 f. 154_b_);\r\nthe second varies from the Turkī, notably by changing _sāch_ and _sāj_\r\nto _shākh_ throughout (I.O. 217 f. 150_b_). The English and French\r\ntranslations differ much (_Memoirs_ p. 206, _Mémoires_ i, 414), the\r\nlatter taking the _mawallah_ to be _mūla_, a hut, against which much is\r\nclear in the various MSS.\r\n\r\nThree Turkī sources[2791] agree in reading as follows:—\r\n\r\n_Mawallahlār-nī_ (or _muwallah_ Ḥai. MS.) _kīltūrdīlār. Bīlmān\r\nsāchlārī-nīng yā `amlī sāchlārī-nīng ārālārīgha k:msān-nī_ (Ilminsky,\r\n_kamān_) _shākh-nīng_ (Ḥai. MS. _șākh_) _aūzūnlūghī bīla aīnjīga aīnjīga\r\nkīsīb, qūīūb tūrlār._\r\n\r\nThe English and French translations differ from the Turkī and from one\r\nanother:—\r\n\r\n(_Memoirs_, p. 206) They brought in branching willow-trees. I do not\r\nknow if they were in the natural state of the tree, or if the branches\r\nwere formed artificially, but they had small twigs cut the length of the\r\nears of a bow and inserted between them.\r\n\r\n(_Mémoires_ i, 434) On façonna des huttes (_mouleh_). Ils les\r\nétablissent en taillant des baguettes minces, de la longeur du bout\r\nrecourbé de l'arc, qu'on place entre des branches naturelles ou\r\nfaçonnées artificiellement, je l'ignore.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the sentence appears to be thus:—_Mawal-lahlār-nī\r\nkīltūrdīlār_, they brought weeping-willows; _k:msān-nī_ _qūīūbtūrlār_,\r\nthey had put _k:msān-nī_; _aīnjīga aīnjīga kīsīb_, cut very fine (or\r\nslender); _shākh_ (or _șākh_)_-nīng aūzūnlūghī_, of the length of a\r\n_shākh_, bow, or _șākh_ ...; _bīlmān sāchlārī-nīng yā `amlī\r\nsāchlārī-nīng ārālārīgha_, to (or at) the spaces of the _sāchlār_\r\nwhether their (_i.e._ the willows') own or artificial _sāchlār_.\r\n\r\nThese translations clearly indicate felt difficulty. Mr. Erskine does\r\nnot seem to have understood that the trees were _Salix babylonica_. The\r\ncrux of the passage is the word _k:msān-nī_, which tells what was placed\r\nin the spaces. It has been read as _kamān_, bow, by all but the scribes\r\nof the two good Turkī MSS. and as in a phrase _horn of a bow_. This\r\nhowever is not allowed by the Turkī, for the reason that _k:msān-nī_ is\r\nnot in the genitive but in the accusative case. (I may say that Bābur\r\ndoes not use _nī_ for _nīng_; he keeps strictly to the prime uses of\r\neach enclitic, _nī_ accusative, _nīng_ genitive.) Moreover, if\r\n_k:msān-nī_ be taken as a genitive, the verbs _qūīūb-tūrlār_ and _kīsīb_\r\nhave no object, no other accusative appearing in the sentence than\r\n_k:msān-nī_.\r\n\r\nA weighty reason against changing _sāch_ into _shākh_ is that Dr.\r\nIlminsky has not done so. He must have attached meaning to _sāch_ since\r\nhe uses it throughout the passage. He was nearer the region wherein the\r\noriginal willows were seen at a feast. Unfortunately nothing shows how\r\nhe interpreted the word.\r\n\r\n_Sāchmāq_ is a tassel; is it also a catkin and were there decorations,\r\n_kimsān-nī_ (things _kimsa_, or flowers Ar. _kim_, or something shining,\r\n_kimcha_, gold brocade) hung in between the catkins?\r\n\r\nIlminsky writes _mu'lah_ (with _ḥamza_) and this de Courteille\r\ntranslates by hut. The Ḥai. MS. writes _muwallah_ (marking the _ẓamma_).\r\n\r\nIn favour of reading _mawallah_ (_mulah_) as a tree and that tree _Salix\r\nbabylonica_ the weeping-willow, there are annotations in the Second\r\nPersian translation and, perhaps following it, in the Elphinstone MS. of\r\n_nām-i-dirakht_, name of a tree, _dīdān-i-bed_, sight of the willow,\r\n_bed-i-mawallah_, mournful-willow. Standing alone _mawallah_ means\r\nweeping-willow, in this use answering to _majnūn_ the name Panj-ābīs\r\ngive the tree, from Leila's lover the distracted _i.e._ Majnūn\r\n(Brandis).\r\n\r\nThe whole question may be solved by a chance remark from a traveller\r\nwitnessing similar festive decoration at another feast in that\r\nconservative region.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.—ON BĀBUR'S EXCAVATED CHAMBER AT QANDAHĀR (f. 208_b_).\r\n\r\nSince making my note (f. 208_b_) on the wording of the passage in which\r\nBābur mentions excavation done by him at Qandahār, I have learned that\r\nhe must be speaking of the vaulted chamber containing the celebrated\r\ninscriptions about which much has been written.[2792]\r\n\r\nThe primary inscription, the one commemorating Bābur's final possession\r\nof Qandahār, gives the chamber the character of a Temple of Victory and\r\nspeaks of it as _Rawāq-i-jahān namāī_, World-shewing-portal,[2793]\r\ndoubtless because of its conspicuous position and its extensive view,\r\nprobably also in allusion to its declaration of victory. Mīr Ma`ṣūm\r\nwrites of it as a Pesh-ṯāq, frontal arch, which, coupled with Mohan\r\nLall's word arch (_ṯāq_) suggests that the chamber was entered through\r\nan arch pierced in a parallelogram smoothed on the rock and having\r\nresemblance to the _pesh-tāq_ of buildings, a suggestion seeming the\r\nmore probable that some inscriptions are on the \"wings\" of the arch. But\r\nby neither of the above-mentioned names do Mohan Lall and later\r\ntravellers call the chamber or write of the place; all describe it by\r\nits approach of forty steps, Chihil-zīna.[3]\r\n\r\nThe excavation has been chipped out of the white-veined limestone of the\r\nbare ridge on and below which stood Old Qandahār.[2794] It does not\r\nappear from the descriptions to have been on the summit of the ridge;\r\nBellew says that the forty steps start half-way up the height. I have\r\nfound no estimate of the height of the ridge, or statement that the\r\nsteps end at the chamber. The ridge however seems to have been of\r\nnoticeably dominating height. It rises steeply to the north and there\r\nends in the naze of which Bābur writes. The foot of the steps is guarded\r\nby two towers. Mohan Lall, unaccustomed to mountains, found their ascent\r\nsteep and dizzy. The excavated chamber of the inscriptions, which Bellew\r\ndescribes as \"bow-shaped and dome-roofed\", he estimated as 12 feet at\r\nthe highest point, 12 feet deep and 8 feet wide. Two sculptured beasts\r\nguard the entrance; Bellew calls them leopards but tigers would better\r\nsymbolize the watch and ward of the Tiger Bābur. In truth the whole\r\nwork, weary steps of approach, tiger guardians, commemorative chamber,\r\nlaboriously incised words, are admirably symbolic of his long-sustained\r\nresolve and action, taken always with Hindūstān as the goal.\r\n\r\nThere are several inscriptions of varying date, within and without the\r\nchamber. Mohan Lall saw and copied them; Darmesteter worked on a copy;\r\nthe two English observers Lumsden and Bellew made no attempt at correct\r\ninterpretation. In the versions all give there are inaccuracies, arising\r\nfrom obvious causes, especially from want of historical _data_. The last\r\nword has not been said; revision awaits photography and the leisured\r\nexpert. A part of the needed revision has been done by Beames, who deals\r\nwith the geography of what Mīr Ma`ṣūm himself added under Akbar after he\r\nhad gone as Governor to Qandahār in 1007 AH. (1598 AD.). This\r\ncommemorates not Bābur's but Akbar's century of cities.\r\n\r\nIt is the primary inscription only which concerns this Appendix. This is\r\none in relief in the dome of the chamber, recording in florid Persian\r\nthat Abū'l-ghāzī Bābur took possession of Qandahār on Shawwāl 13th 928\r\nAH. (Sep. 1st 1522 AD.), that in the same year he commanded the\r\nconstruction of this _Rawāq-i-jahān-namāī_, and that the work had been\r\ncompleted by his son Kāmrān at the time he made over charge of Qandahār\r\nto his brother `Askarī in 9 ... (mutilated). After this the gravure\r\nchanges in character.\r\n\r\nIn the above, Bābur's title Abū'l-ghāzī fixes the date of the\r\ninscription as later than the battle of Kanwāha (f. 324_b_), because it\r\nwas assumed in consequence of this victory over a Hindū, in March 1527\r\n(Jumāda II 933 AH.).\r\n\r\nThe mutilated date 9 ... is given by Mohan Lall as 952 AH. but this does\r\nnot suit several circumstances, _e.g._ it puts completion too far beyond\r\nthe time mentioned as consumed by the work, nine years,—and it was not\r\nthat at which Kāmrān made over charge to `Askarī, but followed the\r\nexpulsion of both full-brothers from Qandahār by their half-brother\r\nHumāyūn.\r\n\r\nThe mutilated date 9 ... is given by Darmesteter as 933 AH. but this\r\nagain does not fit the historical circumstance that Kāmrān was in\r\nQandahār after that date and till 937 AH. This date (937 AH.) we suggest\r\nas fitting to replace the lost figures, (1) because in that year and\r\nafter his father's death, Kāmrān gave the town to `Askarī and went\r\nhimself to Hindūstān, and (2) because work begun in 928 AH. and recorded\r\nas occupying 70-80 men for nine years would be complete in 937 AH.[2795]\r\nThe inscription would be one of the last items of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following matters are added here because indirectly connected with\r\nwhat has been said and because not readily accessible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a. Birth of Kāmrān._\r\n\r\nKāmrān's birth falling in a year of one of the _Bābur-nāma_ gaps, is\r\nnowhere mentioned. It can be closely inferred as 914 or 915 AH. from the\r\ncircumstances that he was younger than Humāyūn born late in 913 AH.,\r\nthat it is not mentioned in the fragment of the annals of 914 AH., and\r\nthat he was one of the children enumerated by Gul-badan as going with\r\nher father to Samarkand in 916 AH. (Probably the children did not start\r\nwith their father in the depth of winter across the mountains.) Possibly\r\nthe joyful name Kāmrān is linked to the happy issue of the Mughūl\r\nrebellion of 914 AH. Kāmrān would thus be about 18 when left in charge\r\nof Kābul and Qandahār by Bābur in 932 AH. before the start for the fifth\r\nexpedition to Hindūstān.\r\n\r\nA letter from Bābur to Kāmrān in Qandahār is with Kehr's Latin version\r\nof the _Bābur-nāma_, in Latin and entered on the lining of the cover. It\r\nis shewn by its main topic _viz._ the despatch of Ibrāhīm _Lūdī_'s son\r\nto Kāmrān's charge, to date somewhere close to Jan. 3rd 1527\r\n(Rabī`u'l-awwal 29th 933 AH.) because on that day Bābur writes of the\r\ndespatch (Ḥai. Codex f. 306_b_ foot).\r\n\r\nPresumably the letter was with Kāmrān's own copy of the _Bābur-nāma_.\r\nThat copy may have reached Humāyūn's hands (JRAS 1908 p. 828 _et\r\nseq._). The next known indication of the letter is given in St.\r\nPetersburg by Dr. Kehr. He will have seen it or a copy of it with the\r\nB.N. Codex he copied (one of unequaled correctness), and he, no doubt,\r\ncopied it in its place on the fly-leaf or board of his own transcript,\r\nbut if so, it has disappeared.\r\n\r\nFuller particulars of it and of other items accompanying it are given in\r\nJRAS 1908 p. 828 _et seq._\r\n\r\n\r\nK.—AN AFGHĀN LEGEND.\r\n\r\nMy husband's article in the Asiatic Quarterly Review of April 1901\r\nbegins with an account of the two MSS. from which it is drawn, _viz._\r\nI.O. 581 in Pushtū, I.O. 582 in Persian. Both are mainly occupied with\r\nan account of the Yūsuf-zāī. The second opens by telling of the power of\r\nthe tribe in Afghānistān and of the kindness of Malik Shāh Sulaimān, one\r\nof their chiefs, to Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā _Kābulī_, (Bābur's paternal uncle,)\r\nwhen he was young and in trouble, presumably as a boy ruler.\r\n\r\nIt relates that one day a wise man of the tribe, Shaikh `Us̤mān saw\r\nSulaimān sitting with the young Mīrzā on his knee and warned him that\r\nthe boy had the eyes of Yazīd and would destroy him and his family as\r\nYazīd had destroyed that of the Prophet. Sulaimān paid him no attention\r\nand gave the Mīrzā his daughter in marriage. Subsequently the Mīrzā\r\nhaving invited the Yūsuf-zāī to Kābul, treacherously killed Sulaimān and\r\n700 of his followers. They were killed at the place called Siyāh-sang\r\nnear Kābul; it is still known, writes the chronicler in about 1770 AD.\r\n(1184 AH.), as the Grave of the Martyrs. Their tombs are revered and\r\nthat of Shaikh `Us̤mān in particular.\r\n\r\nShāh Sulaimān was the eldest of the seven sons of Malik Tāju'd-dīn; the\r\nsecond was Sulṯān Shāh, the father of Malik Aḥmad. Before Sulaimān was\r\nkilled he made three requests of Aūlūgh Beg; one of them was that his\r\nnephew Aḥmad's life might be spared. This was granted.\r\n\r\nAūlūgh Beg died (after ruling from 865 to 907 AH.), and Bābur defeated\r\nhis son-in-law and successor M. Muqīm (_Arghūn_, 910 AH.). Meantime the\r\nYūsuf-zāī had migrated to Pashāwar but later on took Sawād from Sl. Wais\r\n(Ḥai. Codex ff. 219, 220_b_, 221).\r\n\r\nWhen Bābur came to rule in Kābul, he at first professed friendship for\r\nthe Yūsuf-zāī but became prejudiced against them through their enemies\r\nthe Dilazāk[2796] who gave force to their charges by a promised subsidy\r\nof 70,000 _shāhrukhī_. Bābur therefore determined, says the Yūsuf-zāī\r\nchronicler, to kill Malik[2797] Aḥmad and so wrote him a friendly\r\ninvitation to Kābul. Aḥmad agreed to go, and set out with four brothers\r\nwho were famous musicians. Meanwhile the Dilazāk had persuaded Bābur to\r\nput Aḥmad to death at once, for they said Aḥmad was so clever and\r\neloquent that if allowed to speak, he would induce the Pādshāh to pardon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOn Aḥmad's arrival in Kābul, he is said to have learned that Bābur's\r\nreal object was his death. His companions wanted to tie their turbans\r\ntogether and let him down over the wall of the fort, but he rejected\r\ntheir proposal as too dangerous for him and them, and resolved to await\r\nhis fate. He told his companions however, except one of the musicians,\r\nto go into hiding in the town.\r\n\r\nNext morning there was a great assembly and Bābur sat on the\r\ndaïs-throne. Aḥmad made his reverence on entering but Bābur's only\r\nacknowledgment was to make bow and arrow ready to shoot him. When Aḥmad\r\nsaw that Bābur's intention was to shoot him down without allowing him to\r\nspeak, he unbuttoned his jerkin and stood still before the Pādshāh.\r\nBābur, astonished, relaxed the tension of his bow and asked Aḥmad what\r\nhe meant. Aḥmad's only reply was to tell the Pādshāh not to question him\r\nbut to do what he intended. Bābur again asked his meaning and again got\r\nthe same reply.\r\n\r\nBābur put the same question a third time, adding that he could not\r\ndispose of the matter without knowing more. Then Aḥmad opened the mouth\r\nof praise, expatiated on Bābur's excellencies and said that in this\r\ngreat assemblage many of his subjects were looking on to see the\r\nshooting; that his jerkin being very thick, the arrow might not pierce\r\nit; the shot might fail and the spectators blame the Pādshāh for missing\r\nhis mark; for these reasons he had thought it best to bare his breast.\r\nBābur was so pleased by this reply that he resolved to pardon Aḥmad at\r\nonce, and laid down his bow.\r\n\r\nSaid he to Aḥmad, \"What sort of man is Buhlūl _Lūdī_?\" \"A giver of\r\nhorses,\" said Aḥmad.\r\n\r\n\"And of what sort his son Sikandar?\" \"A giver of robes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And of what sort is Bābur?\" \"He,\" said Aḥmad, \"is a giver of heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" rejoined Bābur, \"I give you yours.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pādshāh now became quite friendly with Aḥmad, came down from his\r\nthrone, took him by the hand and led him into another room where they\r\ndrank together. Three times did Bābur have his cup filled, and after\r\ndrinking a portion, give the rest to Aḥmad. At length the wine mounted\r\nto Bābur's head; he grew merry and began to dance. Meantime Aḥmad's\r\nmusician played and Aḥmad who knew Persian well, poured out an eloquent\r\nharangue. When Bābur had danced for some time, he held out his hands to\r\nAḥmad for a reward (_bakhshīsh_), saying, \"I am your performer.\" Three\r\ntimes did he open his hands, and thrice did Aḥmad, with a profound\r\nreverence, drop a gold coin into them. Bābur took the coins, each time\r\nplacing his hand on his head. He then took off his robe and gave it to\r\nAḥmad; Aḥmad took off his own coat, gave it to Adu the musician, and put\r\non what the Pādshāh had given.\r\n\r\nAḥmad returned safe to his tribe. He declined a second invitation to\r\nKābul, and sent in his stead his brother Shāh Manṣūr. Manṣūr received\r\nspeedy dismissal as Bābur was displeased at Aḥmad's not coming. On his\r\nreturn to his tribe Manṣūr advised them to retire to the mountains and\r\nmake a strong _sangur_. This they did; as foretold, Bābur came into\r\ntheir country with a large army. He devastated their lands but could\r\nmake no impression on their fort. In order the better to judge of its\r\ncharacter, he, as was his wont, disguised himself as a Qalandar, and\r\nwent with friends one dark night to the Mahūra hill where the stronghold\r\nwas, a day's journey from the Pādshāh's camp at Dīārūn.\r\n\r\nIt was the `Īd-i-qurbān and there was a great assembly and feasting at\r\nShāh Manṣūr's house, at the back of the Mahūra-mountain, still known as\r\nShāh Manṣūr's throne. Bābur went in his disguise to the back of the\r\nhouse and stood among the crowd in the courtyard. He asked servants as\r\nthey went to and fro about Shāh Manṣūr's family and whether he had a\r\ndaughter. They gave him straightforward answers.\r\n\r\nAt the time Musammat Bībī Mubāraka, Shāh Manṣur's daughter was sitting\r\nwith other women in a tent. Her eye fell on the qalandars and she sent a\r\nservant to Bābur with some cooked meat folded between two loaves. Bābur\r\nasked who had sent it; the servant said it was Shāh Manṣūr's daughter\r\nBībī Mubāraka. \"Where is she?\" \"That is she, sitting in front of you in\r\nthe tent.\" Bābur Pādshāh became entranced with her beauty and asked the\r\nwoman-servant, what was her disposition and her age and whether she was\r\nbetrothed. The servant replied by extolling her mistress, saying that\r\nher virtue equalled her beauty, that she was pious and brimful of\r\nrectitude and placidity; also that she was not betrothed. Bābur then\r\nleft with his friends, and behind the house hid between two stones the\r\nfood that had been sent to him.\r\n\r\nHe returned to camp in perplexity as to what to do; he saw he could not\r\ntake the fort; he was ashamed to return to Kābul with nothing effected;\r\nmoreover he was in the fetters of love. He therefore wrote in friendly\r\nfashion to Malik Aḥmad and asked for the daughter of Shāh Manṣūr, son of\r\nShāh Sulaimān. Great objection was made and earlier misfortunes accruing\r\nto Yūsuf-zāī chiefs who had given daughters to Aūlūgh Beg and Sl. Wais\r\n(Khān Mīrzā?) were quoted. They even said they had no daughter to give.\r\nBābur replied with a \"beautiful\" royal letter, told of his visit\r\ndisguised to Shāh Manṣūr's house, of his seeing Bībī Mubāraka and as\r\ntoken of the truth of his story, asked them to search for the food he\r\nhad hidden. They searched and found. Aḥmad and Manṣūr were still\r\naverse, but the tribesmen urged that as before they had always made\r\nsacrifice for the tribe so should they do now, for by giving the\r\ndaughter in marriage, they would save the tribe from Bābur's anger. The\r\nMaliks then said that it should be done \"for the good of the tribe\".\r\n\r\nWhen their consent was made known to Bābur, the drums of joy were beaten\r\nand preparations were made for the marriage; presents were sent to the\r\nbride, a sword of his also, and the two Maliks started out to escort\r\nher. They are said to have come from Thana by M`amūra (?), crossed the\r\nriver at Chakdara, taken a narrow road between two hills and past\r\nTalāsh-village to the back of Tīrī (?) where the Pādshāh's escort met\r\nthem. The Maliks returned, spent one night at Chakdara and next morning\r\nreached their homes at the Mahūra _sangur_.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Runa the nurse who had control of Malik Manṣūr's household,\r\nwith two other nurses and many male and female servants, went on with\r\nBībī Mubāraka to the royal camp. The bride was set down with all honour\r\nat a large tent in the middle of the camp.\r\n\r\nThat night and on the following day the wives of the officers came to\r\nvisit her but she paid them no attention. So, they said to one another\r\nas they were returning to their tents, \"Her beauty is beyond question,\r\nbut she has shewn us no kindness, and has not spoken to us; we do not\r\nknow what mystery there is about her.\"\r\n\r\nNow Bībī Mubāraka had charged her servants to let her know when the\r\nPādshāh was approaching in order that she might receive him according to\r\nMalik Aḥmad's instructions. They said to her, \"That was the pomp just\r\nnow of the Pādshāh's going to prayers at the general mosque.\" That same\r\nday after the Mid-day Prayer, the Pādshāh went towards her tent. Her\r\nservants informed her, she immediately left her divan and advancing,\r\nlighted up the carpet by her presence, and stood respectfully with\r\nfolded hands. When the Pādshāh entered, she bowed herself before him.\r\nBut her face remained entirely covered. At length the Pādshāh seated\r\nhimself on the divan and said to her, \"Come Afghāniya, be seated.\" Again\r\nshe bowed before him, and stood as before. A second time he said,\r\n\"Afghāniya, be seated.\" Again she prostrated herself before him and came\r\na little nearer, but still stood. Then the Pādshāh pulled the veil from\r\nher face and beheld incomparable beauty. He was entranced, he said\r\nagain, \"O, Afghāniya, sit down.\" Then she bowed herself again, and said,\r\n\"I have a petition to make. If an order be given, I will make it.\" The\r\nPādshāh said kindly, \"Speak.\" Whereupon she with both hands took up her\r\ndress and said, \"Think that the whole Yūsuf-zāī tribe is enfolded in my\r\nskirt, and pardon their offences for my sake.\" Said the Pādshāh, \"I\r\nforgive the Yūsuf-zāī all their offences in thy presence, and cast them\r\nall into thy skirt. Hereafter I shall have no ill-feeling to the\r\nYūsuf-zāī.\" Again she bowed before him; the Pādshāh took her hand and\r\nled her to the divan.\r\n\r\nWhen the Afternoon Prayer time came and the Pādshāh rose from the divan\r\nto go to prayers, Bībī Mubāraka jumped up and fetched him his\r\nshoes.[2798] He put them on and said very pleasantly, \"I am extremely\r\npleased with you and your tribe and I have pardoned them all for your\r\nsake.\" Then he said with a smile, \"We know it was Malik Aḥmad taught you\r\nall these ways.\" He then went to prayers and the Bībī remained to say\r\nhers in the tent.\r\n\r\nAfter some days the camp moved from Dīārūn and proceeded by Bajaur and\r\nTankī to Kābul.[2799]...\r\n\r\nBībī Mubāraka, the Blessed Lady, is often mentioned by Gul-badan; she\r\nhad no children; and lived an honoured life, as her chronicler says,\r\nuntil the beginning of Akbar's reign, when she died. Her brother Mīr\r\nJamāl rose to honour under Bābur, Humāyūn and Akbar.\r\n\r\n\r\nL.—ON MĀHĪM'S ADOPTION OF HIND-ĀL.\r\n\r\nThe passage quoted below about Māhīm's adoption of the unborn Hind-āl we\r\nhave found so far only in Kehr's transcript of the _Bābur-nāma_ (_i.e._\r\nthe St. Petersburg Foreign Office Codex). Ilminsky reproduced it (Kāsān\r\nimprint p. 281) and de Courteille translated it (ii, 45), both with\r\nendeavour at emendation. It is interpolated in Kehr's MS. at the wrong\r\nplace, thus indicating that it was once marginal or apart from the text.\r\n\r\nI incline to suppose the whole a note made by Humāyūn, although part of\r\nit might be an explanation made by Bābur, at a later date, of an\r\nover-brief passage in his diary. Of such passages there are several\r\ninstances. What is strongly against its being Bābur's where otherwise it\r\nmight be his, is that Māhīm, as he always calls her simply, is there\r\nwritten of as Ḥaẓrat Wālida, Royal Mother and with the honorific plural.\r\nThat plural Bābur uses for his own mother (dead 14 years before 925 AH.)\r\nand never for Māhīm. The note is as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"The explanation is this:—As up to that time those of one birth\r\n(_tūqqān_, womb) with him (Humāyūn), that is to say a son Bār-būl, who\r\nwas younger than he but older than the rest, and three daughters,\r\nMihr-jān and two others, died in childhood, he had a great wish for one\r\nof the same birth with him.[2800] I had said 'What it would have been if\r\nthere had been one of the same birth with him!' (Humāyūn). Said the\r\nRoyal Mother, 'If Dil-dār Āghācha bear a son, how is it if I take him\r\nand rear him?' 'It is very good' said I.\"\r\n\r\nSo far doubtfully _might_ be Bābur's but it may be Humāyūn's written as\r\na note for Bābur. What follows appears to be by some-one who knew the\r\ndetails of Māhīm's household talk and was in Kābul when Dil-dār's child\r\nwas taken from her.\r\n\r\n\"Seemingly women have the custom of taking omens in the following\r\nway:—When they have said, 'Is it to be a boy? is it to be a girl?' they\r\nwrite `Alī or Ḥasan on one of two pieces of paper and Fāṯima on the\r\nother, put each paper into a ball of clay and throw both into a bowl of\r\nwater. Whichever opens first is taken as an omen; if the man's, they say\r\na man-child will be born; if the woman's, a girl will be born. They took\r\nthe omen; it came out a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"On this glad tidings we at once sent letters off.[2801] A few days\r\nlater God's mercy bestowed a son. Three days before the news[2802] and\r\nthree days after the birth, they[2803] took the child from its mother,\r\n(she) willy-nilly, brought it to our house[2804] and took it in their\r\ncharge. When we sent the news of the birth, Bhīra was being taken. They\r\nnamed him Hind-āl for a good omen and benediction.\"[2805]\r\n\r\nThe whole may be Humāyūn's, and prompted by a wish to remove an\r\nobscurity his father had left and by sentiment stirred through\r\nreminiscence of a cherished childhood.\r\n\r\nWhether Humāyūn wrote the whole or not, how is it that the passage\r\nappears only in the Russian group of Bāburiana?\r\n\r\nAn apparent answer to this lies in the following little mosaic of\r\ncircumstances:—The St. Petersburg group of Bāburiana[2806] is linked to\r\nKāmrān's own copy of the _Bābur-nāma_ by having with it a letter of\r\nBābur to Kāmrān and also what _may be_ a note indicating its passage\r\ninto Humāyūn's hands (JRAS 1908 p. 830). If it did so pass, a note by\r\nHumāyūn may have become associated with it, in one of several obvious\r\nways. This would be at a date earlier than that of the Elphinstone MS.\r\nand would explain why it is found in Russia and not in Indian MSS.[2807]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[APPENDICES TO THE HINDŪSTĀN SECTION.]\r\n\r\nM.—ON THE TERM _BAḤRĪ QŪT̤ĀS_.\r\n\r\nThat the term _baḥrī qūṯās_ is interpreted by Meninski, Erskine, and de\r\nCourteille in senses so widely differing as _equus maritimus_,\r\nmountain-cow, and _bœuf vert de mer_ is due, no doubt, to their writing\r\nwhen the _qūṯās_, the yāk, was less well known than it now is.\r\n\r\nThe word _qūṯās_ represents both the yāk itself and its neck-tassel and\r\ntail. Hence Meninski explains it by _nodus fimbriatus ex cauda seu\r\ncrinibus equi maritimi_. His \"sea-horse\" appears to render _baḥrī\r\nqūṯās_, and is explicable by the circumstance that the same purposes are\r\nserved by horse-tails and by yāk-tails and tassels, namely, with both,\r\nstandards are fashioned, horse-equipage is ornamented or perhaps\r\nfurnished with fly-flappers, and the ordinary hand-fly-flappers are\r\nmade, _i.e._ the _chowries_ of Anglo-India.\r\n\r\nErskine's \"mountain-cow\" (_Memoirs_ p. 317) may well be due to his\r\n_munshī's_ giving the yāk an alternative name, _viz._ _Kosh-gau_ (Vigne)\r\nor _Khāsh-gau_ (Ney Elias), which appears to mean mountain-cow (cattle,\r\noxen).[2808]\r\n\r\nDe Courteille's _Dictionary_ p. 422, explains _qūtās_ (_qūṯās_) as _bœuf\r\nmarin_ (_baḥrī qūṯās_) and his _Mémoires_ ii, 191, renders Bābur's\r\n_baḥrī qūṯās_ by _bœuf vert de mer_ (f. 276, p. 490 and n. 8).\r\n\r\nThe term _baḥrī qūṯās_ could be interpreted with more confidence if one\r\nknew where the seemingly Arabic-Turkī compound originated.[2809] Bābur\r\nuses it in Hindūstān where the neck-tassel and the tail of the domestic\r\nyāk are articles of commerce, and where, as also probably in Kābul, he\r\nwill have known of the same class of yāk as a saddle-animal and as a\r\nbeast of burden into Kashmīr and other border-lands of sufficient\r\naltitude to allow its survival. A part of its wide Central Asian habitat\r\nabutting on Kashmīr is Little Tibet, through which flows the upper Indus\r\nand in which tame yāk are largely bred, Skardo being a place specially\r\nmentioned by travellers as having them plentifully. This suggests that\r\nthe term _baḥrī qūṯās_ is due to the great river (_baḥr_) and that those\r\nof which Bābur wrote in Hindūstān were from Little Tibet and its great\r\nriver. But _baḥrī_ may apply to another region where also the domestic\r\nyāk abounds, that of the great lakes, inland seas such as Pangong,\r\nwhence the yāk comes and goes between _e.g._ Yārkand and the Hindūstān\r\nborder.\r\n\r\nThe second suggestion, _viz._ that \"_baḥrī qūṯās_\" refers to the habitat\r\nof the domestic yāk in lake and marsh lands of high altitude (the wild\r\nyāk also but, as Tibetan, it is less likely to be concerned here) has\r\nsupport in Dozy's account of the _baḥrī_ falcon, a bird mentioned also\r\nby Abū'l-faẓl amongst sporting birds (_Āyīn-i-akbarī_, Blochmann's trs.\r\np. 295):—\"_Baḥrī, espèce de faucon le meilleur pour les oiseaux de\r\nmarais. Ce renseignment explique peut-être l'origine du mot. Marguerite\r\nen donne la même etymologie que Tashmend et le Père Guagix. Selon lui ce\r\nfaucon aurait été appelé ainsi parce qu'il vient de l'autre côté de la\r\nmer, mais peut-être dériva-t-il de baḥrī dans le sens de marais, flaque,\r\nétang._\"\r\n\r\nDr. E. Denison Ross' _Polyglot List of Birds_ (_Memoirs of the Asiatic\r\nSociety of Bengal_ ii, 289) gives to the _Qarā Qīrghāwal_ (Black\r\npheasant) the synonym \"Sea-pheasant\", this being the literal translation\r\nof its Chinese name, and quotes from the Manchū-Chinese \"Mirror\" the\r\nremark that this is a black pheasant but called \"sea-pheasant\" to\r\ndistinguish it from other black ones.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that Bābur writes of the yāk once only and then of\r\nthe _baḥrī qūṯās_ so that there is no warrant from him for taking the\r\nterm to apply to the wild yāk. His cousin and contemporary Ḥaidar\r\nMīrzā, however, mentions the wild yāk twice and simply as the wild\r\n_qūṯās_.\r\n\r\nThe following are random gleanings about \"_baḥrī_\" and the yāk:—\r\n\r\n(1) An instance of the use of the Persian equivalent _daryā'ī_ of\r\n_baḥrī_, sea-borne or over-sea, is found in the _Akbar-nāma_ (Bib. Ind.\r\ned. ii, 216) where the African elephant is described as _fīl-i-daryā'ī_.\r\n\r\n(2) In Egypt the word _baḥrī_ has acquired the sense of northern,\r\npresumably referring to what lies or is borne across its northern sea,\r\nthe Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n(3) Vigne (_Travels in Kashmīr_ ii, 277-8) warns against confounding the\r\n_qūch-qār_ _i.e._ the gigantic _moufflon_, Pallas' _Ovis ammon_, with\r\nthe _Kosh-gau_, the cow of the Kaucasus, _i.e._ the yāk. He says,\r\n\"Kaucasus (_hodie_ Hindū-kush) was originally from Kosh, and Kosh is\r\napplied occasionally as a prefix, _e.g._ _Kosh-gau_, the yāk or ox of\r\nthe mountain or Kaucasus.\" He wrote from Skardo in Little Tibet and on\r\nthe upper Indus. He gives the name of the female yāk as _yāk-mo_ and of\r\nthe half-breeds with common cows as _bzch_, which class he says is\r\ncommon and of \"all colours\".\r\n\r\n(4) Mr. Ney Elias' notes (_Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_ trs. pp. 302 and 466) on\r\nthe _qūṯās_ are of great interest. He gives the following synonymous\r\nnames for the wild yāk, _Bos Poëphagus_, _Khāsh-gau_, the Tibetan yāk or\r\nDong.\r\n\r\n(5) Hume and Henderson (_Lāhor to Yārkand_ p. 59) write of the numerous\r\nblack yāk-hair tents seen round the Pangong Lake, of fine saddle yāks,\r\nand of the tame ones as being some white or brown but mostly black.\r\n\r\n(6) Olufsen's _Through the Unknown Pamirs_ (p. 118) speaks of the large\r\nnumbers of _Bos grunniens_ (yāk) domesticated by the Kirghiz in the\r\nPamirs.\r\n\r\n(7) Cf. Gazetteer of India _s.n._ yāk.\r\n\r\n(8) Shaikh Zain applies the word _baḥrī_ to the porpoise, when\r\nparaphrasing the _Bābur-nāma_ f. 281_b_.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.—NOTES ON A FEW BIRDS.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to identify some of the birds of Bābur's lists difficulty\r\narises from the variety of names provided by the different tongues of\r\nthe region concerned, and also in some cases by the application of one\r\nname to differing birds. The following random gleanings enlarge and, in\r\npart, revise some earlier notes and translations of Mr. Erskine's and my\r\nown. They are offered as material for the use of those better acquainted\r\nwith bird-lore and with Himālayan dialects.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a._ _Concerning the lūkha_, _lūja_, _lūcha_, _kūja_ (f.135 and\r\nf.278_b_).\r\n\r\nThe nearest word I have found to _lūkha_ and its similars is _likkh_, a\r\nflorican (Jerdon, ii, 615), but the florican has not the chameleon\r\ncolours of the _lūkha_ (var.). As Bābur when writing in Hindūstān, uses\r\nsuch \"book-words\" as Ar. _baḥrī_ (_qūṯās_) and Ar. _bū-qalamūn_\r\n(chameleon), it would not be strange if his name for the \"_lūkha_\" bird\r\nrepresented Ar. _awja_, very beautiful, or connected with Ar. _loḥ_,\r\nshining splendour.\r\n\r\nThe form _kūja_ is found in Ilminsky's imprint p.361 (_Mémoires_ ii,\r\n198, _koudjeh_).\r\n\r\nWhat is confusing to translators is that (as it now seems to me) Bābur\r\nappears to use the name _kabg-i-darī_ in both passages (f.135 and\r\nf.278_b_) to represent two birds; (1) he compares the _lūkha_ as to size\r\nwith the _kabg-i-darī_ of the Kābul region, and (2) for size and colour\r\nwith that of Hindūstān. But the bird, of the Western Himālayas known by\r\nthe name _kabg-i-darī_ is the Himālayan snow-cock, _Tetraogallus\r\nhimālayensis_, Turkī, _aūlār_ and in the Kābul region, _chīūrtika_\r\n(f.249, Jerdon, ii, 549-50); while the _kabg-i-darī_ (syn. _chikor_) of\r\nHindūstān, whether of hill or plain, is one or more of much smaller\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nThe snow-cock being 28 inches in length, the _lūkha_ bird must be of\r\nthis size. Such birds as to size and plumage of changing colour are the\r\n_Lophophori_ and _Trapagons_, varieties of which are found in places\r\nsuiting Bābur's account of the _lūkha_.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that the Himālayan snow-cock is still called\r\n_kabg-i-darī_ in Afghānistān (Jerdon, ii, 550) and in Kashmīr (Vigne's\r\n_Travels in Kashmīr_ ii, 18). As its range is up to 18,000 feet, its\r\nPersian name describes it correctly whether read as \"of the mountains\"\r\n(_dari_), or as \"royal\" (_darī_) through its splendour.\r\n\r\n\r\nI add here the following notes of Mr. Erskine's, which I have not quoted\r\nalready where they occur (cf. f. 135 and f. 278_b_):—\r\n\r\n   On f. 135, \"_lokheh_\" is said to mean _hill-chikor_.\r\n\r\n   On f. 278_b_, to \"_lūjeh_\", \"The Persian has _lūkheh_.\"\r\n\r\n         \"     to \"_kepki durrī_\", \"The _kepkī deri_, or _durri_ is\r\n               much larger than the common _kepk_ of Persia\r\n               and is peculiar to Khorāsān. It is said to be\r\n               a beautiful bird. The common _kepk_ of Persia\r\n               and Khorāsān is the _hill-chikor_ of India.\"\r\n\r\n         \"     to \"higher up\", \"The _lujeh_ may be the _chikor_\r\n               of the plains which Hunter calls bartavelle or\r\n               Greek partridge.\"\r\n\r\nThe following corrections are needed about my own notes:—(1) on f. 135\r\n(p. 213) n. 7 is wrongly referred; it belongs to the first word, _viz._\r\n_kabg-i-darī_, of p. 214; (2) on f. 279 (p. 496) n. 2 should refer to\r\nthe second _kabg-i-darī_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Birds called mūnāl (var. monāl and moonaul)._\r\n\r\nYule writing in _Hobson Jobson_ (p. 580) of the \"_moonaul_\" which he\r\nidentifies as _Lophophorus Impeyanus_, queries whether, on grounds he\r\ngives, the word _moonaul_ is connected etymologically with Sanscrit\r\n_muni_, an \"eremite\". In continuation of his topic, I give here the\r\nnames of other birds called _mūnāl_, which I have noticed in various\r\nornithological works while turning their pages for other information.\r\n\r\nBesides _L. Impeyanus_ and _Trapagon Ceriornis satyra_ which Yule\r\nmentions as called \"_moonaul_\", there are _L. refulgens_, _mūnāl_ and\r\n_Ghūr_ (mountain)-_mūnāl_; _Trapagon Ceriornis satyra_, called _mūnāl_\r\nin Nipāl; _T. C. melanocephalus_, called _sing_ (horned)-_mūnāl_ in the\r\nN.W. Himālayas; _T. himālayensis_, the _jer_- or _cher-mūnāl_ of the\r\nsame region, known also as _chikor_; and _Lerwa nevicola_, the\r\nsnow-partridge known in Garhwal as _Quoir_- or _Qūr-mūnāl_. Do all these\r\nbirds behave in such a way as to suggest that _mūnāl_ may imply the\r\nindividual isolation related by Jerdon of _L. Impeyanus_, \"In the\r\nautumnal and winter months numbers are generally collected in the same\r\nquarter of the forest, though often so widely scattered that each bird\r\nappears to be alone?\" My own search amongst vocabularies of\r\nhill-dialects for the meaning of the word has been unsuccessful, spite\r\nof the long range _mūnāls_ in the Himālayas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Concerning the word chīūrtika, chourtka._\r\n\r\nJerdon's entry (ii, 549, 554) of the name _chourtka_ as a synonym of\r\n_Tetraogallus himālayensis_ enables me to fill a gap I have left on f.\r\n249 (p. 491 and n. 6),[2810] with the name Himālayan snow-cock, and to\r\nallow Bābur's statement to be that he, in January 1520 AD. when coming\r\ndown from the _Bād-i-pīch_ pass, saw many snow-cocks. The _Memoirs_\r\n(p.282) has \"_chikors_\", which in India is a synonym for _kabg-i-darī_;\r\nthe _Mémoires_ (ii, 122) has _sauterelles_, but this meaning of\r\n_chīūrtika_ does not suit wintry January. That month would suit for the\r\ndescent from higher altitudes of snow-cocks. Griffith, a botanist who\r\ntravelled in Afghānistān _cir._ 1838 AD., saw myriads of _cicadæ_\r\nbetween Qilat-i-ghilzai and Ghazni, but the month was July.\r\n\r\n_d._ _On the qūṯān_ (f. 142, p. 224; _Memoirs_, p. 153; _Mémoires_ ii,\r\n313).\r\n\r\nMr. Erskine for _qūṯān_ enters _khawāṣil_ [gold-finch] which he will\r\nhave seen interlined in the Elphinstone Codex (f. 109_b_) in explanation\r\nof _qūṯān_.\r\n\r\nShaikh Effendi (Kunos' ed., p. 139) explains _qūṯān_ to be the\r\ngold-finch, _Steiglitz_.\r\n\r\nIlminsky's _qūtān_ (p. 175) is translated by M. de Courteille as\r\n_pélicane_ and certainly some copies of the 2nd Persian translation\r\n[Muḥ. _Shīrāzi's_ p. 90] have _ḥawāṣil_, pelican.\r\n\r\nThe pelican would class better than the small finch with the\r\n\r\nherons and egrets of Bābur's trio; it also would appear a more likely\r\nbird to be caught \"with the cord\".\r\n\r\nThat Bābur's _qūṯān_ (_ḥawāṣil_) migrated in great numbers is however\r\nagainst supposing it to be _Pelicanus onocrotatus_ which is seen in\r\nIndia during the winter, because it appears there in moderate numbers\r\nonly, and Blanford with other ornithologists states that no western\r\npelican migrates largely into India.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the _qūṯān_ was Linnæus' _Pelicanus carbo_ of which one synonym\r\nis _Carbo comoranus_, the cormorant, a bird seen in India in large\r\nnumbers of both the large and small varieties. As cormorants are not\r\nknown to breed in that country, they will have migrated in the masses\r\nBābur mentions.\r\n\r\nA translation matter falls to mention here:—After saying that the\r\n_aūqār_ (grey heron), _qarqara_ (egret), and _qūtān_ (cormorant) are\r\ntaken with the cord, Bābur says that this method of bird-catching is\r\nunique (_bū nūḥ qūsh tūtmāq ghair muqarrar dūr_) and describes it. The\r\nPersian text omits to translate the _tūtmāq_ (by _P. giriftan_); hence\r\nErskine (_Mems._ p. 153) writes, \"The last mentioned fowl\" (_i.e._ the\r\n_qūṯān_) \"is rare,\" notwithstanding Bābur's statement that all three of\r\nthe birds he names are caught in masses. De Courteille (p. 313) writes,\r\nas though only of the _qūtān_, \"_ces derniers toutefois ne se prennent\r\nqu'accidentelment_,\" perhaps led to do so by knowledge of the\r\ncircumstance that _Pelicanus onocrotatus_ is rare in India.\r\n\r\n\r\nO.—NOTES BY HUMĀYŪN ON SOME HINDŪSTĀN FRUITS.\r\n\r\nThe following notes, which may be accepted as made by Humāyūn and in the\r\nmargin of the archetype of the Elphinstone Codex, are composed in Turkī\r\nwhich differs in diction from his father's but is far closer to that\r\nclassic model than is that of the producer [Jahāngīr?] of the\r\n\"Fragments\" (Index _s.n._). Various circumstances make the notes\r\ndifficult to decipher _verbatim_ and, unfortunately, when writing in\r\nJan. 1917, I am unable to collate with its original in the Advocates\r\nLibrary, the copy I made of them in 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a._ _On the kadhil_, _jack-fruit_, _Artocarpus integrifolia_ (f.\r\n283_b_, p. 506; Elphinstone MS. f. 235_b_).[2811]\r\n\r\nThe contents of the note are that the strange-looking pumpkin (_qar`_,\r\nwhich is also Ibn Batuta's word for the fruit), yields excellent white\r\njuice, that the best fruit grows from the roots of the tree,[2812] that\r\nmany such grow in Bengal, and that in Bengal and Dihli there grows a\r\n_kadhil_-tree covered with hairs (_Artocarpus hirsuta_?).\r\n\r\n\r\n_b._ _On the amrit-phal_, _mandarin-orange_, _Citrus aurantium_ (f. 287,\r\np. 512; Elphinstone Codex, f. 238_b_, l. 12).\r\n\r\nThe interest of this note lies in its reference to Bābur.\r\n\r\nA Persian version of it is entered, without indication of what it is or\r\nof who was its translator, in one of the volumes of Mr. Erskine's\r\nmanuscript remains, now in the British Museum (Add. 26,605, p. 88).\r\nPresumably it was made by his Turkish _munshi_ for his note in the\r\nMemoirs (p. 329).\r\n\r\nVarious difficulties oppose the translation of the Turkī note; it is\r\nwritten into the text of the Elphinstone Codex in two instalments,\r\nneither of them in place, the first being interpolated in the account of\r\nthe _amil-bīd_ fruit, the second in that of the _jāsūn_ flower; and\r\nthere are verbal difficulties also. The Persian translation is not\r\nliteral and in some particulars Mr. Erskine's rendering of this differs\r\nfrom what the Turkī appears to state.\r\n\r\nThe note is, tentatively, as follows:[2813]—\"His honoured Majesty\r\nFirdaus-makān[2814]—may God make his proof clear!—did not\r\nfavour the _amrit-phal_;[2815] as he considered it insipid,[2816] he\r\nlikened it to the mild-flavoured[2817] orange and did not make choice of\r\nit. So much was the mild-flavoured orange despised that if any person\r\nhad disgusted (him) by insipid flattery(?) he used to say, 'He is like\r\norange-juice.'\"[2818]\r\n\r\n\"The _amrit-phal_ is one of the very good fruits. Though its juice is\r\nnot relishing (? _chūchūq_), it is extremely pleasant-drinking. Later\r\non, in my own time, its real merit became known. Its tartness may be\r\nthat of the orange (_nāranj_)and _lemu_.\"[2819]\r\n\r\nThe above passage is followed, in the text of the Elphinstone Codex, by\r\nBābur's account of the _jāsūn_ flower, and into this a further\r\ninstalment of Humāyūn's notes is interpolated, having opposite its first\r\nline the marginal remark, \"This extra note, seemingly made by Humāyūn\r\nPādshāh, the scribe has mistakenly written into the text.\" Whether its\r\nfirst sentence refer to the _amrit-phal_ or to the _amil-bīd_ must be\r\nleft for decision to those well acquainted with the orange-tribe. It is\r\nobscure in my copy and abbreviated in its Persian translation;\r\nsummarized it may state that when the fruit is unripe, its acidity is\r\nharmful to the digestion, but that it is very good when ripe.—The note\r\nthen continues as below:—\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. The kāmila, H. kauṅlā, the orange._[2820]\r\n\r\n\"There are in Bengal two other fruits of the acid kind. Though the\r\n_amrit-phal_ be not agreeable, they have resemblance to it (?).\"\r\n\r\n\"One is the _kāmila_ which may be as large as an orange (_nāranj_); some\r\ntook it to be a large _nārangī_ (orange) but it is much pleasanter\r\neating than the _nārangī_ and is understood not to have the skin of that\r\n(fruit).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. The samṯara._[2821]\r\n\r\n\"The other is the _samṯara_ which is larger than the orange (_nāranj_)\r\nbut is not tart; unlike the _amrit-phal_ it is not of poor flavour (_kam\r\nmaza_) or little relish (_chūchūk_). In short a better fruit is not\r\nseen. It is good to see, good to eat, good to digest. One does not\r\nforget it. If it be there, no other fruit is chosen. Its peel may be\r\ntaken off by the hand. However much of the fruit be eaten, the heart\r\ncraves for it again. Its juice does not soil the hand at all. Its skin\r\nseparates easily from its flesh. It may be taken during and after food.\r\nIn Bengal the _samṯara_ is rare (_ghārib_) (or excellent, _`asīz_). It\r\nis understood to grow in one village Sanārgām (Sonargaon) and even\r\ntherein a special quarter. There seems to be no fruit so entirely good\r\nas the _samṯara_ amongst fruits of its class or, rather, amongst fruits\r\nof all kinds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corrigendum_:—In my note on the _turunj bajāurī_ (p. 511, n. 3) for\r\n_bijaurā_ read _bījaurā_; and on p. 510, l. 2, for _palm_ read\r\n_fingers_.\r\n\r\n_Addendum_:—p. 510, l. 5. After _yūsūnlūk_ add:—\"The natives of\r\nHindūstān when not wearing their ear-rings, put into the large ear-ring\r\nholes, slips of the palm-leaf bought in the bāzārs, ready for the\r\npurpose. The trunk of this tree is handsomer and more stately than that\r\nof the date.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nP.—REMARKS ON BĀBUR'S REVENUE LIST (fol. 292).\r\n\r\n_a. Concerning the date of the List._\r\n\r\nThe Revenue List is the last item of Bābur's account of Hindūstān and,\r\nwith that account, is found _s.a._ 932 AH., manifestly too early, (1)\r\nbecause it includes districts and their revenues which did not come\r\nunder Bābur's authority until subdued in his Eastern campaigns of 934\r\nand 935 AH., (2) because Bābur's statement is that the \"countries\" of\r\nthe List \"are _now_ in my possession\" (_in loco_ p. 520).\r\n\r\nThe List appears to be one of revenues realized in 936 or 937 AH. and\r\nnot one of assessment or estimated revenue, (1) because Bābur's wording\r\nstates as a fact that the revenue was 52 _krūrs_; (2) because the\r\nPersian heading of the (Persian) List is translatable as \"Revenue\r\n(_jama`_)[2822] of Hindūstān from what has so far come under the\r\nvictorious standards\".\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. The entry of the List into European Literature._\r\n\r\nReaders of the L. and E. _Memoirs of Bābur_ are aware that it does not\r\ncontain the Revenue List (p. 334). The omission is due to the absence of\r\nthe List from the Elphinstone Codex and from the `Abdu'r-raḥīm Persian\r\ntranslation. Since the _Memoirs of Bābur_ was published in 1826 AD., the\r\nList has come from the _Bābur-nāma_ into European literature by three\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nOf the three the one used earliest is Shaikh Zain's _T̤abaqāt-i-bāburī_\r\nwhich is a Persian paraphrase of part of Bābur's Hindūstān section. This\r\nwork provided Mr. Erskine with what he placed in his _History of India_\r\n(London 1854, i, 540, Appendix D), but his manuscript, now B.M. Add.\r\n26,202, is not the best copy of Shaikh Zain's book, being of far less\r\nimportance than B.M. Or. 1999, [as to which more will be said.][2823]\r\n\r\nThe second channel is Dr. Ilminsky's imprint of the Turkī text (Kāsān\r\n1857, p. 379), which is translated by the _Mémoires de Bāber_ (Paris\r\n1871, ii, 230).\r\n\r\nThe third channel is the Ḥaidarābād Codex, in the English translation of\r\nwhich [_in loco_] the List is on p. 521.\r\n\r\nShaikh Zain may have used Bābur's autograph manuscript for his\r\nparaphrase and with it the Revenue List. His own autograph manuscript\r\nwas copied in 998 AH. (1589-90 AD.) by Khwānd-amīr's grandson\r\n`Abdu'l-lāh who may be the scribe \"Mīr `Abdu'l-lāh\" of the\r\n_Āyīn-i-akbarī_ (Blochmann's trs. p. 109). `Abdu'l-lāh's transcript\r\n(from which a portion is now absent,) after having been in Sir Henry\r\nElliot's possession, has become B.M. Or. 1999. It is noticed briefly by\r\nProfessor Dowson (_l.c._ iv, 288), but he cannot have observed that the\r\n\"old, worm-eaten\" little volume contains Bābur's Revenue List, since he\r\ndoes not refer to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Agreement and variation in copies of the List._\r\n\r\nThe figures in the two copies (Or. 1999 and Add. 26,202) of the\r\n_T̤abaqāt-i-bāburī_ are in close agreement. They differ, however, from\r\nthose in the Ḥaidarābād Codex, not only in a negligible unit and a ten\r\nof _tankas_ but in having 20,000 more _tankas_ from Oudh and Baraich and\r\n30 _laks_ of _tankas_ more from Trans-sutlej.\r\n\r\nThe figures in the two copies of the _Bābur-nāma_, _viz._ the Ḥaidarābād\r\nCodex and the Kehr-Ilminsky imprint are not in agreement throughout, but\r\nare identical in opposition to the variants (20,000 _t._ and 30 _l._)\r\nmentioned above. As the two are independent, being collateral\r\ndescendants of Bābur's original papers, the authority of the Ḥaidarābād\r\nCodex in the matter of the List is still further enhanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. Varia._\r\n\r\n(1) The place-names of the List are all traceable, whatever their varied\r\nforms. About the entry L:knū [or L:knūr] and B:ks:r [or M:ks:r] a\r\ndifficulty has been created by its variation in manuscripts, not only in\r\nthe List but where the first name occurs _s.a._ 934 and 935 AH. In the\r\nḤaidarābād List and in that of Or. 1999 L:knūr is clearly written and\r\nmay represent (approximately) modern Shahābād in Rāmpūr. Erskine and de\r\nCourteille, however, have taken it to be Lakhnau in Oudh. [The\r\ndistinction of Lakhnaur from Lakhnau in the historical narrative is\r\ndiscussed in Appendix T.]\r\n\r\n(2) It may be noted, as of interest, that the name Sarwār is an\r\nabbreviation of Sarjūpār which means \"other side of Sarjū\" (Sarū,\r\nGoghrā; E. and D.'s H. of I. i, 56, n.4).\r\n\r\n(3) Rūp-narā[:i]n (Deo or Dev) is mentioned in Ajodhya Prasad's short\r\nhistory of Tirhut and Darbhanga, the _Gulzār-i-Bihār_ (Calcutta 1869,\r\nCap. v, 88) as the 9th of the Brahman rulers of Tirhut and as having\r\nreigned for 25 years, from 917 to 942 _Faslī_(?). If the years were\r\nḤijrī, 917-42 AH. would be 1511-1535.[2824]\r\n\r\n(4) Concerning the _tanka_ the following modern description is quoted\r\nfrom Mr. R. Shaw's _High Tartary_ (London 1871, p. 464) \"The _tanga_\"\r\n(or _tanka_) \"is a nominal coin, being composed of 25 little copper\r\ncash, with holes pierced in them and called _dahcheen_. These are strung\r\ntogether and the quantity of them required to make up the value of one\r\nof these silver ingots\" (\"_kooroos_ or _yamboo_, value nearly _£_17\")\r\n\"weighs a considerable amount. I once sent to get change for a\r\n_kooroos_, and my servants were obliged to charter a donkey to bring it\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\n(5) The following interesting feature of Shaikh Zain's\r\n_T̤abaqāt-i-bāburī_ has been mentioned to me by my husband:—Its author\r\noccasionally reproduces Bābur's Turkī words instead of paraphrasing them\r\nin Persian, and does this for the noticeable passage in which Bābur\r\nrecords his dissatisfied view of Hindūstān (f. 290_b_, _in loco_ p.\r\n518), prefacing his quotation with the remark that it is best and will\r\nbe nearest to accuracy not to attempt translation but to reproduce the\r\nPādshāh's own words. The main interest of the matter lies in the motive\r\nfor reproducing the _ipsissima verba_. Was that motive deferential? Did\r\nthe revelation of feeling and opinion made in the quoted passage clothe\r\nit with privacy so that Shaikh Zain reserved its perusal from the larger\r\npublic of Hindūstān who might read Persian but not Turkī? Some such\r\nmotive would explain the insertion untranslated of Bābur's letters to\r\nHumāyūn and to Khwāja Kalān which are left in Turkī by `Abdu'r-raḥīm\r\nMīrzā.[2825]\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.—CONCERNING THE \"RĀMPŪR DĪWĀN\".\r\n\r\nPending the wide research work necessary to interpret Bābur's Hindūstān\r\npoems which the Rāmpūr manuscript preserves, the following comments,\r\nsome tentative and open to correction, may carry further in making the\r\npoems publicly known, what Dr. E. Denison Ross has effected by\r\npublishing his Facsimile of the manuscript.[2826] It is legitimate to\r\nassociate comment on the poems with the _Bābur-nāma_ because many of\r\nthem are in it with their context of narrative; most, if not all,\r\nconnect with it; some without it, would be dull and vapid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a. An authorized English title._\r\n\r\nThe contents of the Rāmpūr MS. are precisely what Bābur describes\r\nsending to four persons some three weeks after the date attached to the\r\nmanuscript,[2827] _viz._ \"the Translation and whatnot of poems made on\r\ncoming to Hindūstān\";[2828] and a similar description may be meant in\r\nthe curiously phrased first clause of the colophon, but without mention\r\nof the Translation (of the _Wālidiyyah-risāla_).[2829] Hence, if the\r\npoems, including the Translation, became known as the _Hindūstān Poems_\r\nor _Poems made in Hindūstān_, such title would be justified by their\r\nauthor's words. Bābur does not call the Hindūstān poems a _dīwān_ even\r\nwhen, as in the above quotation, he speaks of them apart from his\r\nversified translation of the Tract. In what has come down to us of his\r\nautobiography, he applies the name _Dīwān_ to poems of his own once\r\nonly, this in 925 AH. (f. 237_b_) when he records sending \"my _dīwān_\"\r\nto Pūlād Sl. _Aūzbeg_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. The contents of the Rāmpūr MS._\r\n\r\nThere are three separate items of composition in the manuscript, marked\r\nas distinct from one another by having each its ornamented frontispiece,\r\neach its scribe's sign (_mīm_) of Finis, each its division from its\r\nneighbour by a space without entry. The first and second sections bear\r\nalso the official sign [_ṣaḥ[h.]_] that the copy has been inspected and\r\nfound correct.\r\n\r\n(1) The first section consists of Bābur's metrical translation of Khwāja\r\n`Ubaidu'l-lāh _Aḥrārī's Parental Tract_ (_Wālidiyyah-risāla_), his\r\nprologue in which are his reasons for versifying the Tract and his\r\nepilogue which gives thanks for accomplishing the task. It ends with the\r\ndate 935 (Ḥai. MS. f. 346). Below this are _mīm_ and _ṣaḥ[h.]_, the\r\nlatter twice; they are in the scribe's handwriting, and thus make\r\nagainst supposing that Bābur wrote down this copy of the Tract or its\r\narchetype from which the official _ṣaḥ[h.]_ will have been copied.\r\nMoreover, spite of bearing two vouchers of being a correct copy, the\r\nTranslation is emended, in a larger script which may be that of the\r\nwriter of the marginal quatrain on the last page of the [Rāmpūr] MS. and\r\nthere attested by Shāh-i-jahān as Bābur's autograph entry. His also may\r\nhave been the now expunged writing on the half-page left empty of text\r\nat the end of the Tract. Expunged though it be, fragments of words are\r\nvisible.[2830]\r\n\r\n(2) The second section has in its frontispiece an inscription illegible\r\n(to me) in the Facsimile. It opens with a _masnawī_ of 41 couplets which\r\nis followed by a _ghazel_ and numerous poems in several measures, down\r\nto a triad of rhymed couplets (_matla`_?), the whole answering to\r\ndescriptions of a _Dīwān_ without formal arrangement. After the last\r\ncouplet are _mīm_ and _ṣaḥ[h.]_ in the scribe's hand-writing, and a\r\nblank quarter-page. Mistakes in this section have been left uncorrected,\r\nwhich supports the view that its _ṣaḥ[h.]_ avouches the accuracy of its\r\narchetype and not its own.[2831]\r\n\r\n(3) The third section shows no inscription on its frontispiece. It opens\r\nwith the _masnawī_ of eight couplets, found also in the _Bābur-nāma_ (f.\r\n312), one of earlier date than many of the poems in the second section.\r\nIt is followed by three _rubā`ī_ which complete the collection of poems\r\nmade in Hindūstān. A prose passage comes next, describing the\r\ncomposition and transposition-in-metre of a couplet of 16 feet, with\r\nexamples in three measures, the last of which ends in l. 4 of the\r\nphotograph.—While fixing the date of this metrical game, Bābur\r\nincidentally allows that of his _Treatise on Prosody_ to be inferred\r\nfrom the following allusive words:—\"When going to Saṃbhal (f. 330_b_) in\r\nthe year (933 AH.) after the conquest of Hindūstān (932 AH.), two years\r\nafter writing the _`Arūẓ_, I composed a couplet of 16 feet.\"—From this\r\nthe date of the Treatise is seen to be 931 AH., some two years later\r\nthan that of the _Mubīn_. The above metrical exercise was done about the\r\nsame time as another concerning which a Treatise was written, viz. that\r\nmentioned on f. 330_b_, when a couplet was transposed into 504 measures\r\n(Section _f_, p. lxv).—The Facsimile, it will be noticed, shows\r\nsomething unusual in the last line of the prose passage on Plate XVIII\r\nB, where the scattering of the words suggests that the scribe was trying\r\nto copy page _per_ page.\r\n\r\nThe colophon (which begins on l. 5 of the photograph) is curiously\r\nworded, as though the frequent fate of last pages had befallen its\r\narchetype, that of being mutilated and difficult for a scribe to make\r\ngood; it suggests too that the archetype was verse.[2832] Its first\r\nclause, even if read as _Hind-stān jānibī `azīmat qīlghānī_ (i.e. not\r\n_qīlghālī_, as it can be read), has an indirectness unlike Bābur's\r\ncorresponding \"after coming to Hindūstān\" (f. 357_b_), and is not\r\ndefinite; (2) _bū aīrdī_ (these were) is not the complement suiting _aūl\r\ndūrūr_ (those are); (3) Bābur does not use the form _dūrūr_ in prose;\r\n(4) the undue space after _dūrūr_ suggests connection with verse; (5)\r\nthere is no final verb such as prose needs. The meaning, however, may be\r\nas follows:—The poems made after resolving on (the)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHindūstān parts (_jānibī_?) were these I have written down (_taḥrīr\r\nqīldīm_), and past events are those I have narrated (_taqrīr_) in the\r\nway that (_nī-chūk kīm_) (has been) written in these folios (_aūrāq_)\r\nand recorded in those sections (_ajzā'_).—From this it would appear that\r\nsections of the _Bābur-nāma_ (f. 376_b_, p. 678) accompanied the\r\nHindūstān poems to the recipient of the message conveyed by the\r\ncolophon.\r\n\r\nClose under the colophon stands _Ḥarara-hu Bābur_ and the date Monday,\r\nRabī` II. 15th 935 (Monday, December 27th 1528 AD.), the whole\r\npresumably brought over from the archetype. To the question whether a\r\nsignature in the above form would be copied by a scribe, the Elphinstone\r\nCodex gives an affirmative answer by providing several examples of\r\nnotes, made by Humāyūn in its archetype, so-signed and brought over\r\neither into its margin or interpolated in its text. Some others of\r\nHumāyūn's notes are not so-signed, the scribe merely saying they are\r\nHumāyūn Pādshāh's.—It makes against taking the above entry of Bābur's\r\nname to be an autograph signature, (1) that it is enclosed in an\r\nornamented border, as indeed is the case wherever it occurs throughout\r\nthe manuscript; (2) that it is followed by the scribe's _mīm_. [See end\r\nof following section.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. The marginal entries shown in the photograph._\r\n\r\nThe marginal note written length-wise by the side of the text is signed\r\nby Shāh-i-jahān and attests that the _rubā`ī_ and the signature to which\r\nit makes reference are in Bābur's autograph hand-writing. His note\r\ntranslates as follows:—This quatrain and blessed name are in the actual\r\nhand-writing of that Majesty (_ān ḥaẓrat_) _Firdaus-makānī_ Bābur\r\nPādshāh _Ghāzī_—May God make his proof clear!—Signed (_Ḥararā-hu_),\r\nShāh-i-jahān son of Jahāngīr Pādshāh son of Akbar Pādshāh son of Humāyūn\r\nPādshāh son of Bābur Pādshāh.[2833]\r\n\r\nThe second marginal entry is the curiously placed _rubā`ī_, which is now\r\nthe only one on the page, and now has no signature attaching to it. It\r\nhas the character of a personal message to the recipient of one of more\r\nbooks having identical contents. That these two entries are there while\r\nthe text seems so clearly to be written by a scribe, is open to the\r\nexplanation that when (as said about the colophon, p. lx) the rectangle\r\nof text was made good from a mutilated archetype, the original margin\r\nwas placed round the _rifacimento_? This superposition would explain the\r\nentries and seal-like circles, discernible against a strong light, on\r\nthe reverse of the margin only, through the _rifacimento_ page. The\r\nupper edge of the rectangle shows sign that the margin has been adjusted\r\nto it [so far as one can judge from a photograph]. Nothing on the face\r\nof the margin hints that the text itself is autograph; the words of the\r\ncolophon, _taḥrīr qīldīm_ (_i.e._ I have written down) cannot hold good\r\nagainst the cumulative testimony that a scribe copied the whole\r\nmanuscript.—The position of the last syllable [_nī_] of the _rubā`ī_\r\nshows that the signature below the colophon was on the margin before the\r\ndiagonal couplet of the _rubā`ī_ was written,—therefore when the margin\r\nwas fitted, as it looks to have been fitted, to the _rifacimento_. If\r\nthis be the order of the two entries [_i.e._ the small-hand signature\r\nand the diagonal couplet], Shāh-i-jahān's \"blessed name\" may represent\r\nthe small-hand signature which certainly shows minute differences from\r\nthe writing of the text of the MS. in the name Bābur (_q.v. passim_ in\r\nthe Rāmpūr MS.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. The Bāburī-khat̤t̤_ (_Bābūr's script_).\r\n\r\nSo early as 910 AH. the year of his conquest of Kābul, Bābur devised\r\nwhat was probably a variety of _nakhsh_, and called it the\r\n_Bāburī-khat̤t̤_ (f. 144_b_), a name used later by Ḥaidar Mīrzā,\r\nNiẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad and `Abdu'l-qādir _Badāyūnī_. He writes of it again\r\n(f. 179) _s.a._ 911 AH. when describing an interview had in 912 AH. with\r\none of the Harāt Qāẓīs, at which the script was discussed, its\r\nspecialities (_mufradāt_) exhibited to, and read by the Qāẓī who there\r\nand then wrote in it.[2834] In what remains to us of the _Bābur-nāma_\r\nit is not mentioned again till 935 AH. (fol. 357_b_) but at some\r\nintermediate date Bābur made in it a copy of the Qorān which he sent to\r\nMakka.[2835] In 935 AH. (f. 357_b_) it is mentioned in significant\r\nassociation with the despatch to each of four persons of a copy of the\r\nTranslation (of the _Wālidiyyah-risāla_) and the Hindūstān poems, the\r\nsignificance of the association being that the simultaneous despatch\r\nwith these copies of specimens of the _Bāburī-khat̤t̤_ points to its use\r\nin the manuscripts, and at least in Hind-āl's case, to help given for\r\nreading novel forms in their text. The above are the only instances now\r\nfound in the _Bābur-nāma_ of mention of the script.\r\n\r\nThe little we have met with—we have made no search—about the character\r\nof the script comes from the _Abūshqa_, _s.n._ _sīghnāq_, in the\r\nfollowing entry:—\r\n\r\n_Sīghnāq ber nū`ah khat̤t̤ der Chaghatāīda khat̤t̤ Bāburī u ghairī kibī\r\nki Bābur Mīrzā ash`ār'nda kīlūr bait_\r\n\r\n   _Khūblār khat̤t̤ī naṣīb'ng būlmāsā Bābur nī tāng?_\r\n\r\n   _Bāburī khat̤t̤ī aīmās dūr khat̤t̤ sīghnāqī mū dūr?_[2836]\r\n\r\nThe old Osmanli-Turkish prose part of this appears to mean:—\"_Sīghnāq_\r\nis a sort of hand-writing, in Chaghatāī the _Bāburī-khat̤t̤_ and others\r\nresembling it, as appears in Bābur Mīrzā's poems. Couplet\":—\r\n\r\nWithout knowing the context of the couplet I make no attempt\r\nto translate it because its words _khat̤t̤_ or _khaṭ_ and _sīghnāq_\r\nlend themselves to the kind of pun (_īhām_) \"which consists\r\nin the employment of a word or phrase having more than one appropriate\r\nmeaning, whereby the reader is often left in doubt as to the real\r\nsignificance of the passage.\"[2837] The rest of the _rubā`ī_ may be\r\ngiven [together with the six other quotations of Bābur's verse now known\r\nonly through the _Abūshqa_], in early _Taẕkirātu 'sh-shu`āra_ of date\r\nearlier than 967 AH.\r\n\r\nThe root of the word _sīghnāq_ will be _sīq_, pressed together, crowded,\r\nincluded, _etc._; taking with this notion of compression, the\r\nexplanations _feine Schrift_ of Shaikh Effendi (Kunos) and Vambéry's\r\n_pétite écriture_, the Sīghnāqī and Bāburī Scripts are allowed to have\r\nbeen what that of the Rāmpūr MS. is, a small, compact, elegant\r\nhand-writing.—A town in the Caucasus named Sīghnākh, \"_située à peu près\r\nà 800 mètres d'altitude, commença par être une forteresse et un lieu de\r\nrefuge, car telle est la signification de son nom tartare_.\"[2838]\r\n_Sīghnāqī_ is given by de Courteille (Dict. p. 368) as meaning a place\r\nof refuge or shelter.\r\n\r\nThe _Bāburī-khat̤t̤_ will be only one of the several hands Bābur is\r\nreputed to have practised; its description matches it with other\r\nniceties he took pleasure in, fine distinctions of eye and ear in\r\nmeasure and music.\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. Is the Rāmpūr MS. an example of the Bāburī-khat̤t̤?_\r\n\r\nThough only those well-acquainted with Oriental manuscripts dating\r\nbefore 910 AH. (1504 AD.) can judge whether novelties appear in the\r\nscript of the Rāmpūr MS. and this particularly in its head-lines, there\r\nare certain grounds for thinking that though the manuscript be not\r\nBābur's autograph, it may be in his script and the work of a specially\r\ntrained scribe.\r\n\r\nI set these grounds down because although the signs of a scribe's work\r\non the manuscript seem clear, it is \"locally\" held to be Bābur's\r\nautograph. Has a tradition of its being in the _Bāburī-khat̤t̤_ glided\r\ninto its being in the _khat̤t̤-i-Bābur_? Several circumstances suggest\r\nthat it may be written in the _Bāburī-khat̤t̤:_—(1) the script is\r\nspecially associated with the four transcripts of the Hindūstān poems\r\n(f. 357_b_), for though many letters must have gone to his sons, some\r\nindeed are mentioned in the _Bābur-nāma_, it is only with the poems that\r\nspecimens of it are recorded as sent; (2) another matter shows his\r\npersonal interest in the arrangement of manuscripts, namely, that as he\r\nhimself about a month after the four books had gone off, made a new\r\nruler, particularly on account of the head-lines of the Translation, it\r\nmay be inferred that he had made or had adopted the one he superseded,\r\nand that his plan of arranging the poems was the model for copyists; the\r\nRāmpūr MS. bearing, in the Translation section, corrections which may be\r\nhis own, bears also a date earlier than that at which the four gifts\r\nstarted; it has its headlines ill-arranged and has throughout 13 lines\r\nto the page; his new ruler had 11; (3) perhaps the words _taḥrīr qīldīm_\r\nused in the colophon of the Rāmpūr MS. should be read with their full\r\nconnotation of careful and elegant writing, or, put modestly, as saying,\r\n\"I wrote down in my best manner,\" which for poems is likely to be in the\r\n_Bāburī-khat̤t̤_.[2839]\r\n\r\nPerhaps an example of Bābur's script exists in the colophon, if not in\r\nthe whole of the _Mubīn_ manuscript once owned by Berézine, by him used\r\nfor his _Chréstomathie Turque_, and described by him as \"unique\". If\r\nthis be the actual manuscript Bābur sent into Mā warā'u'n-nahr\r\n(presumably to Khwāja Aḥrārī's family), its colophon which is a personal\r\nmessage addressed to the recipients, is likely to be autograph.\r\n\r\n\r\n_f. Metrical amusements._\r\n\r\n(1) Of two instances of metrical amusements belonging to the end of 933\r\nAH. and seeming to have been the distractions of illness, one is a\r\nsimple transposition \"in the fashion of the circles\" (_dawā'ir_) into\r\nthree measures (Rāmpūr MS. Facsimile, Plate XVIII and p. 22); the other\r\nis difficult because of the high number of 504 into which Bābur says (f.\r\n330_b_) he cut up the following couplet:—\r\n\r\n   _Gūz u qāsh u soz u tīlīnī mū dī?\r\n   Qad u khadd u saj u bīlīnī mū dī?_\r\n\r\nAll manuscripts agree in having 504, and Bābur wrote a tract (_risāla_)\r\nupon the transpositions.[2840] None of the modern treatises on Oriental\r\nProsody allow a number so high to be practicable, but Maulānā Saifī of\r\nBukhārā, of Bābur's own time (f. 180_b_) makes 504 seem even moderate,\r\nsince after giving much detail about _rubā`ī_ measures, he observes,\r\n\"Some say there are 10,000\" (_Arūẓ-i-Saifī_, Ranking's trs. p. 122).\r\nPresumably similar possibilities were open for the couplet in question.\r\nIt looks like one made for the game, asks two foolish questions and\r\ngives no reply, lends itself to poetic license, and, if permutation of\r\nwords have part in such a game, allows much without change of sense. Was\r\nBābur's cessation of effort at 504 capricious or enforced by the\r\nexhaustion of possible changes? Is the arithmetical statement 9 × 8 × 7\r\n= 504 the formula of the practicable permutations?\r\n\r\n(2) To improvise verse having a given rhyme and topic must have demanded\r\nquick wits and much practice. Bābur gives at least one example of it (f.\r\n252_b_) but Jahāngīr gives a fuller and more interesting one, not only\r\nbecause a _rubā`ī_ of Bābur's was the model but from the circumstances\r\nof the game:[2841]—It was in 1024 AH. (1615 AD.) that a letter reached\r\nhim from Māwarā'u'n-nahr written by Khwāja Hāshim _Naqsh-bandī_ [who by\r\nthe story is shown to have been of Aḥrārī's line], and recounting the\r\nlong devotion of his family to Jahāngīr's ancestors. He sent gifts and\r\nenclosed in his letter a copy of one of Bābur's quatrains which he said\r\nḤaẓrat Firdaus-makānī had written for Ḥaẓrat Khwājagī (Aḥrārī's eldest\r\nson; f. 36_b_, p. 62 n. 2). Jahāngīr quotes a final hemistich only,\r\n\"_Khwājagīra mānda'īm, Khwājagīrā banda'īm_\" and thereafter made an\r\nimpromptu verse upon the one sent to him.\r\n\r\nA curious thing is that the line he quotes is not part of the quatrain\r\nhe answered, but belongs to another not appropriate for a message\r\nbetween _darwesh_ and _pādshāh_, though likely to have been sent by\r\nBābur to Khwājagī. I will quote both because the matter will come up\r\nagain for who works on the Hindūstān poems.[2842]\r\n\r\n(1) The quatrain from the _Hindūstān Poems_ is:—\r\n\r\n   _Dar hawā'ī nafs gumrah `umr ẓāi` karda'īm_ [_kanda'īm_?];\r\n   _Pesh ahl-i-allāh az af`āl-i-khūd sharmanda'īm;\r\n   Yak naẕr bā mukhlaṣān-i-khasta-dil farmā ki mā\r\n   Khwājagīrā mānda'īm u Khwājagīrā banda'īm._\r\n\r\n(2) That from the _Akbar-nāma_ is:—\r\n\r\n   _Darweshānrā agarcha nah as khweshānīm,\r\n   Lek az dil u jān mu`taqid eshānīm;\r\n   Dūr ast magū`ī shāhī az darweshī,\r\n   Shāhīm walī banda-i-darweshānīm._\r\n\r\nThe greater suitability of the second is seen from Jahāngīr's answering\r\nimpromptu for which by sense and rhyme it sets the model; the meaning,\r\nhowever, of the fourth line in each may be identical, namely, \"I remain\r\nthe ruler but am the servant of the _darwesh_.\" Jahāngīr's impromptu is\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n   _Āī ānki marā mihr-i-tū besh az besh ast,\r\n   Az daulat yād-i-būdat āī darwesh ast;\r\n   Chandānki'z muẕẖ dahāt dilam shād shavad\r\n   Shadīm az ānki laṯif az ḥadd besh ast._\r\n\r\nHe then called on those who had a turn for verse to \"speak one\" _i.e._\r\nto improvise on his own; it was done as follows:—\r\n\r\n   _Dārīm agarcha shaghal-i-shāhī dar pesh,\r\n   Har laḥẕa kunīm yād-i-darweshān besh;\r\n   Gar shād shavad'z mā dil-i-yak darwesh,\r\n   Ānra shumarīm ḥaṣil-i-shāhī khwesh._\r\n\r\n\r\nR.—CHANDĪRĪ AND GŪĀLĪĀR.\r\n\r\nThe courtesy of the Government of India enables me to reproduce from the\r\n_Archæological Survey Reports_ of 1871, Sir Alexander Cunningham's plans\r\nof Chandīrī and Gūālīār, which illustrate Bābur's narrative on f. 333,\r\np. 592, and f. 340, p. 607.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP of the FORT and CITY of CHÂNDERI]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP of the FORT and CITY of CHÂNDERI]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORTRESS OF GWALIOR]\r\n\r\n\r\nS.—CONCERNING THE BĀBUR-NĀMA DATING OF 935 AH.\r\n\r\nThe dating of the diary of 935 AH. (f. 339 _et seq._) is several times\r\nin opposition to what may be distinguished as the \"book-rule\" that the\r\n12 lunar months of the Ḥijra year alternate in length between 30 and 29\r\ndays (intercalary years excepted), and that Muḥarram starts the\r\nalternation with 30 days. An early book stating the rule is Gladwin's\r\n_Bengal Revenue Accounts_; a recent one, Ranking's ed. of Platts'\r\n_Persian Grammar_.\r\n\r\nAs to what day of the week was the initial day of some of the months in\r\n935 AH. Bābur's days differ from Wüstenfeld's who gives the full list of\r\ntwelve, and from Cunningham's single one of Muḥarram 1st.\r\n\r\nIt seems worth while to draw attention to the flexibility, within\r\nlimits, of Bābur's dating, [not with the object of adversely criticizing\r\na rigid and convenient rule for common use, but as supplementary to that\r\nrule from a somewhat special source], because he was careful and\r\nobservant, his dating was contemporary, his record, as being _de die in\r\ndiem_, provides a check of consecutive narrative on his dates, which,\r\nmoreover, are all held together by the external fixtures of Feasts and\r\nby the marked recurrence of Fridays observed. Few such writings as the\r\nBābur-nāma diaries appear to be available for showing variation within a\r\nyear's limit.\r\n\r\nIn 935 AH. Bābur enters few full dates, _i.e._ days of the week and\r\nmonth. Often he gives only the day of the week, the safest, however, in\r\na diary. He is precise in saying at what time of the night or the day an\r\naction was done; this is useful not only as helping to get over\r\ndifficulties caused by minor losses of text, but in the more general\r\nmatter of the transference of a Ḥijra night-and-day which begins after\r\nsunset, to its Julian equivalent, of a day-and-night which begins at 12\r\na.m. This sometimes difficult transference affords a probable\r\nexplanation of a good number of the discrepant dates found in\r\nOriental-Occidental books.\r\n\r\nTwo matters of difference between the Bābur-nāma dating and that of some\r\nEuropean calendars are as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n_a. Discrepancy as to the day of the week on which Muḥ 935_ AH. _began._\r\n\r\nThis discrepancy is not a trivial matter when a year's diary is\r\nconcerned. The record of Muḥ. 1st and 2nd is missing from the\r\n_Bābur-nāma_; Friday the 3rd day of Muḥarram is the first day specified;\r\nthe 1st was a Wednesday therefore. Erskine accepted this day; Cunningham\r\nand Wüstenfeld give Tuesday. On three grounds Wednesday seems right—at\r\nany rate at that period and place:—(1) The second Friday in Muḥarram was\r\n`Āshūr, the 10th (f. 240); (2) Wednesday is in serial order if reckoning\r\nbe made from the last surviving date of 934 AH. with due allowance of an\r\nintercalary day to Ẕū'l-ḥijja (Gladwin), _i.e._ from Thursday Rajab 12th\r\n(April 2nd 1528 AD. f. 339, p. 602); (3) Wednesday is supported by the\r\ndaily record of far into the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Variation in the length of the months of 935_ AH.\r\n\r\nThere is singular variation between the _Bābur-nāma_ and Wüstenfeld's\r\n_Tables_, both as to the day of the week on which months began, and as\r\nto the length of some months. This variation is shown in the following\r\ntable, where asterisks mark agreement as to the days of the week, and\r\nthe capital letters, quoted from W.'s _Tables_, denote A, Sunday;\r\nB, Tuesday, _etc._ (the bracketed names being of my entry).\r\n\r\n             _Bābur-nāma._               _Wüstenfeld_\r\n                           Days.

(This is seen readily by following the initial\r\ndays of the week.) Again:—these eight months are in pairs having\r\nrespectively 29 and 30 days, and the year's total is 364.—Four months\r\nfollow the fixed rule, _i.e._ as though the year had begun Muḥ. 30 days,\r\nṢafar 29 days—namely, the two months of Rabī` and the two of\r\nJumāda.—Ramẓān to which under \"book-rule\" 30 days are due, had 29 days,\r\nbecause, as Bābur records, the Moon was seen on the 29th.—In the other\r\nthree instances of the reversed 30 and 29, one thing is common, _viz._\r\nMuḥarram, Rajab, Ẕū'l-qa`da (as also Ẕū'l-ḥijja) are \"honoured\"\r\nmonths.—It would be interesting if some expert in this Musalmān matter\r\nwould give the reasons dictating the changes from rule noted above as\r\noccurring in 935 AH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Varia._\r\n\r\n(1) On f. 367 Saturday is entered as the 1st day of Sha`bān and\r\nWednesday as the 4th, but on f. 368_b_ stands Wednesday 5th, as suits\r\nthe serial dating. If the mistake be not a mere slip, it may be due to\r\nconfusion of hours, the ceremony chronicled being accomplished on the\r\neve of the 5th, Anglicé, after sunset on the 4th.\r\n\r\n(2) A fragment only survives of the record of Ẕū'l-ḥijja 935 AH. It\r\ncontains a date, Thursday 7th, and mentions a Feast which will be that\r\nof the _`Īdu'l-kabīr_ on the 10th (Sunday). Working on from this to the\r\nfirst-mentioned day of 936 AH. _viz._ Tuesday, Muḥarram 3rd, the month\r\n(which is the second of a pair having 29 and 30 days) is seen to have 30\r\ndays and so to fit on to 936 AH. The series is Sunday 10th, 17th, 24th\r\n(Sat. 30th) Sunday 1st, Tuesday 3rd.\r\n\r\nTwo clerical errors of mine in dates connecting with this Appendix are\r\ncorrected here:—(1) On p. 614 n. 5, for Oct. 2nd read Oct. 3rd; (2) on\r\np. 619 penultimate line of the text, for Nov. 28th read Nov. 8th.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.—ON L:KNŪ (LAKHNAU) AND L:KNŪR (LAKHNŪR, NOW SHĀHĀBĀD IN RĀMPŪR).\r\n\r\nOne or other of the above-mentioned names occurs eight times in the\r\n_Bābur-nāma_ (_s.a._ 932, 934, 935 AH.), some instances being shown by\r\ntheir context to represent Lakhnau in Oudh, others inferentially and by\r\nthe verbal agreement of the Ḥaidarābād Codex and Kehr's Codex to stand\r\nfor Lakhnūr (now Shāhābād in Rāmpūr). It is necessary to reconsider the\r\nidentification of those not decided by their context, both because there\r\nis so much variation in the copies of the `Abdu'r-raḥīm Persian\r\ntranslation that they give no verbal help, and because Mr. Erskine and\r\nM. de Courteille are in agreement about them and took the whole eight to\r\nrepresent Lakhnau. This they did on different grounds, but in each case\r\ntheir agreement has behind it a defective textual basis.—Mr. Erskine, as\r\nis well known, translated the `Abdu'r-raḥīm Persian text without access\r\nto the original Turkī but, if he had had the Elphinstone Codex when\r\ntranslating, it would have given him no help because all the eight\r\ninstances occur on folios not preserved by that codex. His only sources\r\nwere not-first-rate Persian MSS. in which he found casual variation from\r\nterminal _nū_ to _nūr_, which latter form may have been read by him as\r\n_nūū_ (whence perhaps the old Anglo-Indian transliteration he uses,\r\nLuknow).[2843]—M. de Courteille's position is different; his uniform\r\n_Lakhnau_ obeyed the same uniformity in his source the Kāsān Imprint,\r\nand would appear to him the more assured for the concurrence of the\r\n_Memoirs_. His textual basis, however, for these words is Dr. Ilminsky's\r\nand not Kehr's. No doubt the uniform _Lakhnū_ of the Kāsān Imprint is\r\nthe result of Dr. Ilminsky's uncertainty as to the accuracy of his\r\nsingle Turkī archetype [Kehr's MS.], and also of his acceptance of Mr.\r\nErskine's uniform _Luknow_.[2844]—Since the Ḥaidarābād Codex became\r\navailable and its collation with Kehr's Codex has been made, a better\r\nbasis for distinguishing between the L:knū and L:knūr of the Persian\r\nMSS. has been obtained.[2845] The results of the collation are entered\r\nin the following table, together with what is found in the Kāsān Imprint\r\nand the _Memoirs_. [N.B. The two sets of bracketed instances refer each\r\nto one place; the asterisks show where Ilminsky varies from Kehr.]\r\n\r\n                 _Ḥai.

The Turkī\r\ncodices are supported by B.M. Or. 1999, which is a direct copy of Shaikh\r\nZain's autograph _T̤ābaqāt-i-bāburī_, all three having L:knūr. Kehr's\r\nMS. and Or. 1999 are descendants of the second degree from the original\r\nList; that the Ḥai. Codex is a direct copy is suggested by its\r\npseudo-tabular arrangement of the various items.—An important\r\nconsideration supporting _L:knūr_, is that the List is in Persian and\r\nmay reasonably be accepted as the one furnished officially for the\r\nPādshāh's information when he was writing his account of Hindūstān (cf.\r\nAppendix P, p. liv). This official character disassociates it from any\r\nsuch doubtful spelling by the foreign Pādshāh as cannot but suggest\r\nitself when the variants of _e.g._ Dalmau and Bangarmau are considered.\r\nL:knūr is what three persons copying independently read in the official\r\nList, and so set down that careful scribes _i.e._ Kehr and `Abdu'l-lāh\r\n(App. P) again wrote L:knūr.[2846]—Another circumstance favouring L:knūr\r\n(Lakhnūr) is that the place assigned to it in the List is its\r\ngeographical one between Saṃbhal and Khairābād.—Something for [or\r\nperhaps against] accepting Lakhnūr as the _sarkār_ of the List may be\r\nknown in local records or traditions. It had been an important place,\r\nand later on it paid a large revenue to Akbar [as part of Saṃbhal].—It\r\nappears to have been worth the attention of Bīban _Jalwānī_ (f.\r\n329).—Another place is associated with L:knūr in the Revenue List, the\r\nforms of which are open to a considerable number of interpretations\r\nbesides that of Baksar shown _in loco_ on p. 521. Only those well\r\nacquainted with the United Provinces or their bye-gone history can offer\r\nuseful suggestion about it. Maps show a \"Madkar\" 6 m. south of old\r\nLakhnūr; there are in the United Provinces two Baksars and as many other\r\nLakhnūrs (none however being so suitable as what is now Shāhābād).\r\nPerhaps in the archives of some old families there may be help found to\r\ninterpret the entry _L:knūr u B:ks:r_ (var.), a conjecture the less\r\nimprobable that the _Gazetteer of the Province of Oude_ (ii, 58)\r\nmentions a _farmān_ of Bābur Pādshāh's dated 1527 AD. and upholding a\r\ngrant to Shaikh Qāẓī of Bīlgrām.\r\n\r\nThe fourth instance (f. 329) is fairly confirmed as Lakhnūr by its\r\ncontext, _viz._ an officer received the district of Badāyūn from the\r\nPādshāh and was sent against Bīban who had laid siege to L:knūr on which\r\nBadāyūn bordered.—At the time Lakhnau may have been held from Bābur by\r\nShaikh Bāyazīd _Farmūlī_ in conjunction with Aūd. Its estates are\r\nrecorded as still in Farmūlī possession, that of the widow of \"Kala\r\nPahār\" _Farmūlī_.—(_See infra._)\r\n\r\nThe fifth instance (f. 334) connects with Aūd (Oudh) because royal\r\ntroops abandoning the place L:knū were those who had been sent against\r\nShaikh Bāyazīd in Aūd.\r\n\r\nThe remaining three instances (f. 376, f. 376_b_, f. 377_b_) appear to\r\nconcern one place, to which Bīban and Bāyazīd were rumoured to intend\r\ngoing, which they captured and abandoned. As the table of variants\r\nshows, Kehr's MS. reads Lakhnūr in all three places, the Ḥai. MS. once\r\nonly, varying from itself as it does in Nos. 1 and 2.—A circumstance\r\nsupporting _Lakhnūr_ is that one of the messengers sent to Bābur with\r\ndetails of the capture was the son of Shāh Muḥ. _Dīwāna_ whose record\r\nassociates him rather with Badakhshān, and with Humāyūn and Saṃbhal\r\n[perhaps with Lakhnūr itself] than with Bābur's own army.—Supplementing\r\nmy notes on these three instances, much could be said in favour of\r\nreading Lakhnūr, about time and distance done by the messengers and by\r\n`Abdu'l-lah _kitābdār_, on his way to Saṃbhal and passing near Lakhnūr;\r\nmuch too about the various rumours and Bābur's immediate counter-action.\r\nBut to go into it fully would need lengthy treatment which the\r\nhistorical unimportance of the little problem appears not to\r\ndemand.—Against taking the place to be Lakhnau there are the\r\nconsiderations (_a_) that Lakhnūr was the safer harbourage for the Rains\r\nand less near the westward march of the royal troops returning from the\r\nbattle of the Goghrā; (_b_) that the fort of Lakhnau was the renowned\r\nold Machchi-bawan (cf. _Gazetteer of the Province of Oude_, 3 vols.,\r\n1877, ii, 366).—So far as I have been able to fit dates and transactions\r\ntogether, there seems no reason why the two Afghāns should not have gone\r\nto Lakhnūr, have crossed the Ganges near it, dropped down south [perhaps\r\neven intending to recross at Dalmau] with the intention of getting back\r\nto the Farmūlīs and Jalwānīs perhaps in Sārwār, perhaps elsewhere to\r\nBāyazīd's brother Ma`rūf.\r\n\r\n\r\nU.—THE INSCRIPTIONS ON BĀBUR'S MOSQUE IN AJODHYA (OUDH).\r\n\r\nThanks to the kind response made by the Deputy-Commissioner of Fyzābād\r\nto my husband's enquiry about two inscriptions mentioned by several\r\nGazetteers as still existing on \"Bābur's Mosque\" in Oudh, I am able to\r\nquote copies of both.[2847]\r\n\r\n_a._ The inscription inside the Mosque is as follows:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3 lines of Arabic script]\r\n\r\n   1. _Ba farmūda-i-Shāh Bābur ki `ādilash\r\n         Banā'īst tā kākh-i-gardūn mulāqī_,\r\n\r\n   2. _Banā kard īn muhbiṯ-i-qudsiyān\r\n         Amīr-i-sa`ādat-nishān Mīr Bāqī_\r\n\r\n   3. _Bavad khair bāqī! chū sāl-i-banā'īsh\r\n         `Iyān shud ki guftam_,—_Buvad khair bāqī_ (935).\r\n\r\nThe translation and explanation of the above, manifestly made by a\r\nMusalmān and as such having special value, are as follows:—[2848]\r\n\r\n1. By the command of the Emperor Bābur whose justice is an edifice\r\nreaching up to the very height of the heavens,\r\n\r\n2. The good-hearted Mīr Bāqī built this alighting-place of angels;[2849]\r\n\r\n3. _Bavad khāir bāqī!_ (May this goodness last for ever!)[2850]\r\n\r\nThe year of building it was made clear likewise when I said, _Buvad\r\nkhair bāqī_ ( = 935).[2851]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this is:—\r\n\r\n1st couplet:—The poet begins by praising the Emperor Bābur under whose\r\norders the mosque was erected. As justice is the (chief) virtue of\r\nkings, he naturally compares his (Bābur's) justice to a palace reaching\r\nup to the very heavens, signifying thereby that the fame of that justice\r\nhad not only spread in the wide world but had gone up to the heavens.\r\n\r\n2nd couplet:—In the second couplet, the poet tells who was entrusted\r\nwith the work of construction. Mīr Bāqī was evidently some nobleman of\r\ndistinction at Bābur's Court.—The noble height, the pure religious\r\natmosphere, and the scrupulous cleanliness and neatness of the mosque\r\nare beautifully suggested by saying that it was to be the abode of\r\nangels.\r\n\r\n3rd couplet:—The third couplet begins and ends with the expression\r\n_Buvad khair bāqī_. The letters forming it by their numerical values\r\nrepresent the number 935, thus:—\r\n\r\n   _B_ = 2, _v_ = 6, _d_ = 4                  total  12\r\n   _Kh_ = 600, _ai_ = 10, _r_ = 200             \"   810\r\n   _B_ = 2, _ā_ = 1, _q_ = 100, _r_ = 10        \"   113\r\n                                                    ___\r\n                                            Total   935\r\n\r\nThe poet indirectly refers to a religious commandment (_dictum_?) of the\r\nQorān that a man's good deeds live after his death, and signifies that\r\nthis noble mosque is verily such a one.\r\n\r\n_b._ The inscription outside the Mosque is as follows:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3 lines of Arabic script]\r\n\r\n   1. _Ba nām-i-anki dānā hast akbar\r\n         Ki khāliq-i-jamla `ālam lā-makānī_\r\n\r\n   2. _Durūd Muṣṯafá ba`d az sitāyish\r\n         Ki sarwar-i-aṃbiyā' dū jahānī_\r\n\r\n   3. _Fasāna dar jahān Bābur qalandar\r\n         Ki shud dar daur gītī kāmrānī._[2852]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the above is as follows:—\r\n\r\nIn the first couplet the poet praises God, in the second Muḥammad, in\r\nthe third Bābur.—There is a peculiar literary beauty in the use of the\r\nword _lā-makānī_ in the 1st couplet. The author hints that the mosque is\r\nmeant to be the abode of God, although He has no fixed abiding-place.—In\r\nthe first hemistich of the 3rd couplet the poet gives Bābur the\r\nappellation of _qalandar_, which means a perfect devotee, indifferent to\r\nall worldly pleasures. In the second hemistich he gives as the reason\r\nfor his being so, that Bābur became and was known all the world over as\r\na _qalandar_, because having become Emperor of India and having thus\r\nreached the summit of worldly success, he had nothing to wish for on\r\nthis earth.[2853]\r\n\r\nThe inscription is incomplete and the above is the plain interpretation\r\nwhich can be given to the couplets that are to hand. Attempts may be\r\nmade to read further meaning into them but the language would not\r\nwarrant it.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.—BĀBUR'S GARDENS IN AND NEAR KĀBUL.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars about gardens made by Bābur in or near Kābul,\r\nare given in Muḥammad Amīr of Kazwīn's _Pādshāh-nāma_ (Bib. Ind. ed. p.\r\n585, p. 588).\r\n\r\nTen gardens are mentioned as made:—the Shahr-ārā (Town-adorning) which\r\nwhen Shāh-i-jahān first visited Kābul in the 12th year of his reign\r\n(1048 AH.-1638 AD.) contained very fine plane-trees Bābur had planted,\r\nbeautiful trees having magnificent trunks,[2854]—the Chār-bāgh,—the\r\nBāgh-i-jalau-khāna,[2855]—the Aūrta-bāgh (Middle-garden),—the\r\nṢaurat-bāgh,—the Bāgh-i-mahtāb (Moonlight-garden),—the Bāgh-i-āhū-khāna\r\n(Garden-of-the-deer-house),—and three smaller ones. Round these gardens\r\nrough-cast walls were made (renewed?) by Jahāngīr (1016 AH.).\r\n\r\nThe above list does not specify the garden Bābur made and selected for\r\nhis burial; this is described apart (_l.c._ p. 588) with details of its\r\nrestoration and embellishment by Shāh-i-jahān the master-builder of his\r\ntime, as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe burial-garden was 500 yards (_gaz_) long; its ground was in 15\r\nterraces, 30 yards apart(?). On the 15th terrace is the tomb of Ruqaiya\r\nSulṯān Begam[2856]; as a small marble platform (_chabūṭra_) had been\r\nmade near it by Jahāngīr's command, Shāh-i-jahān ordered (both) to be\r\nenclosed by a marble screen three yards high.—Bābur's tomb is on the\r\n14th terrace. In accordance with his will, no building was erected over\r\nit, but Shāh-i-jahān built a small marble mosque on the terrace\r\nbelow.[2857] It was begun in the 17th year (of Shāh-i-jahān's reign) and\r\nwas finished in the 19th, after the conquest of Balkh and Badakhshān, at\r\na cost of 30,000 _rūpīs_. It is admirably constructed.—From the 12th\r\nterrace running-water flows along the line (_rasta_) of the\r\navenue;[2858] but its 12 water-falls, because not constructed with\r\ncemented stone, had crumbled away and their charm was lost; orders were\r\ngiven therefore to renew them entirely and lastingly, to make a small\r\nreservoir below each fall, and to finish with Kābul marble the edges of\r\nthe channel and the waterfalls, and the borders of the reservoirs.—And\r\non the 9th terrace there was to be a reservoir 11 x 11 yards, bordered\r\nwith Kābul marble, and on the 10th terrace one 15 x 15, and at the\r\nentrance to the garden another 15 x 15, also with a marble border.—And\r\nthere was to be a gateway adorned with gilded cupolas befitting that\r\nplace, and beyond (_pesh_) the gateway a square station,[2859] one side\r\nof which should be the garden-wall and the other three filled with\r\ncells; that running-water should pass through the middle of it, so that\r\nthe destitute and poor people who might gather there should eat their\r\nfood in those cells, sheltered from the hardship of snow and rain.[2860]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n   [1] From Atkinson's _Sketches in Afghanistan_ (I.O.

Erskine's Preface _passim_, and _in loco_ item XI,\r\n   cap. iv. _The Memoirs of Baber_, and Index _s.n._\r\n\r\n   [25] The last blow was given to the phantasmal reputation of\r\n   the book by the authoritative Haidarabad Codex which now can\r\n   be seen in facsimile in many Libraries.\r\n\r\n   [26] But for present difficulties of intercourse with\r\n   Petrograd, I would have re-examined with Kehr's the collateral\r\n   Codex of 1742 (copied in 1839 and now owned by the Petrograd\r\n   University). It might be useful; as Kehr's volume has lost\r\n   pages and may be disarranged here and there.\r\n\r\n   The list of Kehr's items is as follows:—\r\n\r\n     1 (_not in the Imprint_). A letter from Babur to Kamran the\r\n     date of which is fixed as 1527 by its committing Ibrahim\r\n     _Ludi's_ son to Kamran's charge (p. 544). It is heard of again\r\n     in the Bukhara Compilation, is lost from Kehr's Codex, and\r\n     preserved from his archetype by Klaproth who translated it.\r\n     Being thus found in Bukhara in the first decade of the\r\n     eighteenth century (our earliest knowledge of the Compilation\r\n     is 1709), the inference is allowed that it went to Bukhara as\r\n     loot from the defeated Kamran's camp and that an endorsement\r\n     its companion Babur-nama (proper) bears was made by the Auzbeg\r\n     of two victors over Kamran, both of 1550, both in\r\n     Tramontana.(1)\r\n\r\n     2 (_not in Imp._). Timur-pulad's memo. about the purchase of\r\n     his Codex in cir. 1521 (_eo cap. post_).\r\n\r\n     3 (_Imp. 1_). Compiler's Preface of Praise (JRAS. 1900, p.\r\n     474).\r\n\r\n     4 (_Imp. 2_). Babur's Acts in Farghana, in diction such as to\r\n     seem a re-translation of the Persian translation of 1589. How\r\n     much of Kamran's MS. was serviceable is not easy to decide,\r\n     because the Turki fettering of `Abdu'r-rahim's Persian lends\r\n     itself admirably to re-translation.(2)\r\n\r\n     5 (_Imp. 3_). The \"Rescue-passage\" (App. D) attributable to\r\n     Jahangir.\r\n\r\n     6 (_Imp. 4_). Babur's Acts in Kabul, seeming (like No. 4) a\r\n     re-translation or patching of tattered pages. There are also\r\n     passages taken verbatim from the Persian.\r\n\r\n     7 (_Imp. omits_). A short length of Babur's Hindustan Section,\r\n     carefully shewn damaged by dots and dashes.\r\n\r\n     8 (_Imp. 5_). Within 7, the spurious passage of App. L and\r\n     also scattered passages about a feast, perhaps part of 7.\r\n\r\n     9 (_Imp. separates off at end of vol._). Translated passage\r\n     from the _Akbar-nāma_, attributable to Jahangir, briefly\r\n     telling of Kanwa (1527), Babur's latter years (both changed to\r\n     first person), death and court.(3)\r\n\r\n     [Babur's history has been thus brought to an end, incomplete\r\n     in the balance needed of 7. In Kehr's volume a few pages are\r\n     left blank except for what shews a Russian librarian's opinion\r\n     of the plan of the book, \"Here end the writings of Shah\r\n     Babur.\"]\r\n\r\n     10 (_Imp. omits_). Preface to the history of Humayun,\r\n     beginning at the Creation and descending by giant strides\r\n     through notices of Khans and Sultans to \"Babur Mirza who was\r\n     the father of Humayun Padshah\". Of Babur what further is said\r\n     connects with the battle of Ghaj-davan (918-1512 _q.v._). It\r\n     is ill-informed, laying blame on him as if he and not Najm\r\n     Sani had commanded—speaks of his preference for the counsel of\r\n     young men and of the numbers of combatants. It is noticeable\r\n     for more than its inadequacy however; its selection of the\r\n     Ghaj-davan episode from all others in Babur's career supports\r\n     circumstantially what is dealt with later, the Ghaj-davani\r\n     authorship of the Compilation.\r\n\r\n     11 (_Imp. omits_). Under a heading \"Humayun Padshah\" is a\r\n     fragment about (his? Accession) Feast, whether broken off by\r\n     loss of his pages or of those of his archetype examination of\r\n     the P. Univ. Codex may show.\r\n\r\n     12 (_Imp. 6_). An excellent copy of Babur's Hindustan Section,\r\n     perhaps obtained from the Ahrari house. [This Ilminski places\r\n     (I think) where Kehr has No. 7.] From its position and from\r\n     its bearing a scribe's date of completion (which Kehr brings\r\n     over), _viz._ _Tamt shud 1126_ (Finished 1714), the compiler\r\n     may have taken it for Humayun's, perhaps for the account of\r\n     his reconquest of Hind in 1555.\r\n\r\n     [The remaining entries in Kehr's volume are a quatrain which\r\n     may make jesting reference to his finished task, a librarian's\r\n     Russian entry of the number of pages (831), and the words\r\n     _Etablissement Orientale, Fr. v. Adelung_, 1825 (the Director\r\n     of the School from 1793).(4)]\r\n\r\n   [27] That Babur-nama of the \"Kamran-docket\" is the mutilated\r\n   and tattered basis, allowed by circumstance, of the compiled\r\n   history of Babur, filled out and mended by the help of the\r\n   Persian translation of 1589.

Like\r\n   others who have made statements resting on the mistaken\r\n   identity of the Bukhara Compilation, many of mine are now\r\n   given to the winds.\r\n\r\n   [31] _See_ Gregorief's \"Russian policy regarding Central\r\n   Asia\", quoted in Schuyler's Turkistan, App. IV.\r\n\r\n   [32] The Mission was well received, started to return to\r\n   Petrograd, was attacked by Turkmans, went back to Bukhara, and\r\n   there stayed until it could attempt the devious route which\r\n   brought it to the capital in 1725.\r\n\r\n   [33] One might say jestingly that the spirit in the book had\r\n   rebelled since 1725 against enforced and changing masquerade\r\n   as a phantasm of two other books!\r\n\r\n   [34] Neither Ilminski nor Smirnov mentions another\r\n   \"Babur-nama\" Codex than Kehr's.\r\n\r\n   [35] A Correspondent combatting my objection to publishing a\r\n   second edition of the _Memoirs_, backed his favouring opinion\r\n   by reference to `Umar Khayyam and Fitzgerald. Obviously no\r\n   analogy exists; Erskine's redundance is not the flower of a\r\n   deft alchemy, but is the prosaic consequence of a secondary\r\n   source.\r\n\r\n   [36] The manuscripts relied on for revising the first section\r\n   of the Memoirs, (_i.e._ 899 to 908 AH.-1494 to 1502 AD.) are\r\n   the Elphinstone and the Ḥaidarābād Codices. To variants from\r\n   them occurring in Dr. Kehr's own transcript no authority can\r\n   be allowed because throughout this section, his text appears\r\n   to be a compilation and in parts a retranslation from one or\r\n   other of the two Persian translations (_Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_) of\r\n   the _Bābur-nāma_. Moreover Dr. Ilminsky's imprint of Kehr's\r\n   text has the further defect in authority that it was helped\r\n   out from the Memoirs, itself not a direct issue from the Turkī\r\n   original.\r\n\r\n   Information about the manuscripts of the _Bābur-nāma_ can be\r\n   found in the JRAS for 1900, 1902, 1905, 1906, 1907 and 1908.\r\n\r\n   The foliation marked in the margin of this book is that of the\r\n   Ḥaidarābād Codex and of its facsimile, published in 1905 by\r\n   the Gibb Memorial Trust.\r\n\r\n   [37] Bābur, born on Friday, Feb. 14th. 1483 (Muḥarram 6, 888\r\n   AH.), succeeded his father, `Umar Shaikh who died on June 8th.\r\n   1494 (Ramẓān 4, 899 AH.).\r\n\r\n   [38] _pād-shāh_, protecting lord, supreme. It would be an\r\n   anachronism to translate _pādshāh_ by King or Emperor,\r\n   previous to 913 AH. (1507 AD.) because until that date it was\r\n   not part of the style of any Tīmūrid, even ruling members of\r\n   the house being styled Mīrzā. Up to 1507 therefore Bābur's\r\n   correct style is Bābur Mīrzā. (_Cf._ f. 215 and note.)\r\n\r\n   [39] See _Āyīn-i-akbarī_, Jarrett, p. 44.\r\n\r\n   [40] The Ḥai. MS. and a good many of the W.-i-B. MSS. here\r\n   write Aūtrār. [Aūtrār like Tarāz was at some time of its\r\n   existence known as Yāngī (New).] Tarāz seems to have stood\r\n   near the modern Auliya-ātā; Ālmālīgh,—a Metropolitan see of\r\n   the Nestorian Church in the 14th. century,—to have been the\r\n   old capital of Kuldja, and Ālmātū (var. Ālmātī) to have been\r\n   where Vernoe (Vierny) now is. Ālmālīgh and Ālmātū owed their\r\n   names to the apple (_ālmā_). _Cf._ Bretschneider's Mediæval\r\n   Geography p. 140 and T.R.

Of this compulsion Bābur's bald phrase _Mughūl u\r\n   Aūzbeg jihatdīn_ provides an illustration. Each earlier\r\n   translator has expressed his meaning with more finish than he\r\n   himself; `Abdu'r-raḥīm, by _az jihat `ubūr-i_ (_Mughūl u_)\r\n   _Aūzbeg_, improves on Bābur, since the three towns lay in the\r\n   tideway of nomad passage (_`ubūr_) east and west; Erskine\r\n   writes \"in consequence of the incursions\" etc. and de C.\r\n   \"_grace aux ravages commis_\" etc.\r\n\r\n   [42] Schuyler (ii, 54) gives the extreme length of the valley\r\n   as about 160 miles and its width, at its widest, as 65 miles.\r\n\r\n   [43] Following a manifestly clerical error in the Second\r\n   W.-i-B. the _Akbar-nāma_ and the Mems. are without the\r\n   seasonal limitation, \"in winter.\" Bābur here excludes from\r\n   winter routes one he knew well, the Kīndīrlīk Pass; on the\r\n   other hand Kostenko says that this is open all the year round.\r\n   Does this contradiction indicate climatic change? (_Cf._ f.\r\n   54b and note; A.N. Bib. Ind. ed. i, 85 (H. Beveridge i, 221)\r\n   and, for an account of the passes round Farghāna, Kostenko's\r\n   _Turkistān Region_, Tables of Contents.)\r\n\r\n   [44] Var. Banākat, Banākas̤, Fīākat, Fanākand. Of this place\r\n   Dr. Rieu writes (Pers. cat. i, 79) that it was also called\r\n   Shāsh and, in modern times, Tāshkīnt. Bābur does not identify\r\n   Fanākat with the Tāshkīnt of his day but he identifies it with\r\n   Shāhrukhiya (_cf._ Index _s.nn._) and distinguishes between\r\n   Tāshkīnt-Shāsh and Fanākat-Shāhrukhiya. It may be therefore\r\n   that Dr. Rieu's Tāshkīnt-Fanākat was Old Tāshkīnt,—(Does\r\n   Fanā-kīnt mean Old Village?) some 14 miles nearer to the\r\n   Saiḥūn than the Tāshkīnt of Bābur's day or our own.\r\n\r\n   [45] _ hech daryā qātīlmās._ A gloss of _dīgar_ (other) in the\r\n   Second W.-i-B. has led Mr. Erskine to understand \"meeting with\r\n   no other river in its course.\" I understand Bābur to contrast\r\n   the destination of the Saiḥūn which he [erroneously] says\r\n   sinks into the sands, with the outfall of _e.g._ the Amū into\r\n   the Sea of Aral.\r\n\r\n   _Cf._ First W.-i-B. I.O. MS. 215 f. 2; Second W.-i-B. I.O.

Of frontiers he\r\n   says nothing.\r\n\r\n   [47] _i.e._ they are given away or taken. Bābur's interest in\r\n   fruits was not a matter of taste or amusement but of food.\r\n   Melons, for instance, fresh or stored, form during some months\r\n   the staple food of Turkistānīs. _Cf._ T.R. p. 303 and (in\r\n   Kāshmīr) 425; Timkowski's _Travels of the Russian Mission_ i,\r\n   419 and Th.

I understand Bābur\r\n   to mean that all the water entering was consumed in the town.\r\n   The supply of Andijān, in the present day, is taken both from\r\n   the Āq Būrā (_i.e._ the Aūsh Water) and, by canal, from the\r\n   Qarā Daryā.\r\n\r\n   [51] _khandaqnīng tāsh yānī._ Second W.-i-B.

Bābur's adjective\r\n   _stone_ is _sangīn_ (f. 45b l. 8). His point here is the\r\n   unusual circumstance of a high-road running round the outer\r\n   edge of the ditch. Moreover Andijān is built on and of loess.\r\n   Here, obeying his Persian source, Mr. Erskine writes\r\n   \"stone-faced ditch\"; M. de C. obeying his Turkī one, \"_bord\r\n   extérieur_.\"\r\n\r\n   [52] _qīrghāwal āsh-kīnasī bīla.

It has here a gloss not in the\r\n   Ḥaidarābād or Kehr's MSS. (_Cf_. Mems. p. 4 note.) This gloss\r\n   may be one of Humāyūn's numerous notes and may have been\r\n   preserved in the Elphinstone Codex, but the fact cannot now be\r\n   known because of the loss of the two folios already noted.\r\n   (_See_ Von Schwarz and Kostenko concerning the autumn fever of\r\n   Transoxiana.)\r\n\r\n   [56] The Pers. trss. render _yīghāch_ by _farsang_; Ujfalvy\r\n   also takes the _yīghāch_ and the _farsang_ as having a common\r\n   equivalent of about 6 _kilomètres_. Bābur's statements in\r\n   _yīghāch_ however, when tested by ascertained distances, do\r\n   not work out into the _farsang_ of four miles or the\r\n   _kilomètre_ of 8 _kil._ to 5 miles. The _yīghāch_ appears to\r\n   be a variable estimate of distance, sometimes indicating the\r\n   time occupied on a given journey, at others the distance to\r\n   which a man's voice will carry. (_Cf._ Ujfalvy _Expédition\r\n   scientifique_ ii, 179; Von Schwarz p. 124 and de C.'s Dict.\r\n   _s.n._ _yīghāch_. In the present instance, if Bābur's 4 y.\r\n   equalled 4 f. the distance from Aūsh to Andijān should be\r\n   about 16 m.; but it is 33 m. 1-3/4 fur. _i.e._ 50 _versts_.\r\n   Kostenko ii, 33.) I find Bābur's _yīghāch_ to vary from about\r\n   4 m. to nearly 8 m.\r\n\r\n   [57] _āqār sū_, the irrigation channels on which in Turkistān\r\n   all cultivation depends. Major-General Gérard writes, (Report\r\n   of the Pamir Boundary Commission, p. 6,) \"Osh is a charming\r\n   little town, resembling Islāmābād in Kāshmīr,—everywhere the\r\n   same mass of running water, in small canals, bordered with\r\n   willow, poplar and mulberry.\" He saw the Āq Būrā, the _White\r\n   wolf_, mother of all these running waters, as a \"bright,\r\n   stony, trout-stream;\" Dr. Stein saw it as a \"broad, tossing\r\n   river.\" (Buried Cities of Khotan, p. 45.) _Cf_.

(p. 3) \"The excellencies of Ush are celebrated even in\r\n   the sacred traditions.\" _Méms._ (i, 2) \"_On cite beaucoup de\r\n   traditions qui célèbrent l'excellence de ce climat._\" Aūsh may\r\n   be mentioned in the traditions on account of places of\r\n   pilgrimage near it; Bābur's meaning may be merely that its\r\n   excellencies are traditional. _Cf._ Ujfalvy ii, 172.\r\n\r\n   [59] Most travellers into Farghāna comment on Bābur's account\r\n   of it. One much discussed point is the position of the Barā\r\n   Koh. The personal observations of Ujfalvy and Schuyler led\r\n   them to accept its identification with the rocky ridge known\r\n   as the Takht-i-sulaimān. I venture to supplement this by the\r\n   suggestion that Bābur, by Barā Koh, did not mean the whole of\r\n   the rocky ridge, the name of which, Takht-i-sulaimān, an\r\n   ancient name, must have been known to him, but one only of its\r\n   four marked summits. Writing of the ridge Madame Ujfalvy says,\r\n   \"_Il y a quatre sommets dont le plus élevé est le troisième\r\n   comptant par le nord_.\" Which summit in her sketch (p. 327) is\r\n   the third and highest is not certain, but one is so shewn that\r\n   it may be the third, may be the highest and, as being a peak,\r\n   can be described as symmetrical _i.e._ Bābur's _mauzūn_. For\r\n   this peak an appropriate name would be Barā Koh.\r\n\r\n   If the name Barā Koh could be restricted to a single peak of\r\n   the Takht-i-sulaimān ridge, a good deal of earlier confusion\r\n   would be cleared away, concerning which have written, amongst\r\n   others, Ritter (v, 432 and 732); Réclus (vi. 54); Schuyler\r\n   (ii, 43) and those to whom these three refer. For an excellent\r\n   account, graphic with pen and pencil, of Farghāna and of Aūsh\r\n   _see_ Madame Ujfalvy's _De Paris à Samarcande_ cap. v.\r\n\r\n   [60] _rūd._ This is a precise word since the Āq Būrā (the\r\n   White Wolf), in a relatively short distance, falls from the\r\n   Kūrdūn Pass, 13,400 ft. to Aūsh, 3040 ft. and thence to\r\n   Andijān, 1380 ft. _Cf._ Kostenko i, 104; Huntingdon in\r\n   Pumpelly's _Explorations in Turkistān_ p. 179 and the French\r\n   military map of 1904.\r\n\r\n   [61] Whether Bābur's words, _bāghāt_, _bāghlār_ and _bāghcha_\r\n   had separate significations, such as orchard, vineyard and\r\n   ordinary garden _i.e._ garden-plots of small size, I am not\r\n   able to say but what appears fairly clear is that when he\r\n   writes _bāghāt u bāghlār_ he means _all sorts of gardens_,\r\n   just as when he writes _begāt u beglār_, he means _begs of all\r\n   ranks_.\r\n\r\n   [62] Madame Ujfalvy has sketched a possible successor.\r\n   Schuyler found two mosques at the foot of Takht-i-sulaimān,\r\n   perhaps Bābur's Jauza Masjid.\r\n\r\n   [63] _aūl shāh-jū'īdīn sū qūyārlār._\r\n\r\n   [64] Ribbon Jasper, presumably.\r\n\r\n   [65] Kostenko (ii, 30), 71-3/4 versts _i.e._ 47 m. 4-1/2 fur.\r\n   by the Postal Road.\r\n\r\n   [66] Instead of their own kernels, the Second W.-i-B. stuffs\r\n   the apricots, in a fashion well known in India by _khūbānī_,\r\n   with almonds (_maghz-i badām_). The Turkī wording however\r\n   allows the return to the apricots of their own kernels and Mr.\r\n   Rickmers tells me that apricots so stuffed were often seen by\r\n   him in the Zar-afshān Valley. My husband has shewn me that\r\n   Niẕāmī in his Haft Paikar appears to refer to the other\r\n   fashion, that of inserting almonds:—\r\n\r\n     \"I gave thee fruits from the garden of my heart,\r\n     Plump and sweet as honey in milk;\r\n     Their substance gave the lusciousness of figs,\r\n     In their hearts were the kernels of almonds.\"\r\n\r\n   [67] What this name represents is one of a considerable number\r\n   of points in the _Bābur-nāma_ I am unable to decide. _Kīyīk_\r\n   is a comprehensive name (_cf._ Shaw's Vocabulary); _āq kīyīk_\r\n   might mean _white sheep_ or _white deer_. It is rendered in\r\n   the Second W.-i-B., here, by _ahū-i-wāriq_ and on f. 4, by\r\n   _ahū-i-safed_. Both these names Mr. Erskine has translated by\r\n   \"white deer,\" but he mentions that the first is said to mean\r\n   _argālī_ _i.e._ _ovis poli_, and refers to _Voyages de Pallas_\r\n   iv, 325.\r\n\r\n   [68] Concerning this much discussed word, Bābur's testimony is\r\n   of service. It seems to me that he uses it merely of those\r\n   settled in towns (villages) and without any reference to tribe\r\n   or nationality. I am not sure that he uses it always as a\r\n   noun; he writes of a _Sārt kīshī_, a Sārt person. His Asfara\r\n   Sārts may have been Turkī-speaking settled Turks and his\r\n   Marghīnānī ones Persian-speaking Tājiks. _Cf._ Shaw's\r\n   Vocabulary; _s.n._ Sārt; Schuyler i, 104 and note; Nalivkine's\r\n   _Histoire du Khanat de Khokand_ p. 45 n.

It is rendered the less applicable\r\n   by the variability of the _yīghāch_, the equivalent for a\r\n   _farsang_ presumed by the Persian translator.\r\n\r\n   [71] Ḥai. MS. _Farsī-gū'ī_. The Elph. MS. and all those\r\n   examined of the W.-i-B. omit the word _Farsī_; some writing\r\n   _kohī_ (mountaineer) for _gū'ī_. I judge that Bābur at first\r\n   omitted the word _Farsī_, since it is entered in the Ḥai. MS.\r\n   above the word _gū'ī_. It would have been useful to Ritter\r\n   (vii, 733) and to Ujfalvy (ii, 176). _Cf._ Kostenko i, 287 on\r\n   the variety of languages spoken by Sārts.\r\n\r\n   [72] Of the Mirror Stone neither Fedtschenko nor Ujfalvy could\r\n   get news.\r\n\r\n   [73] Bābur distinguishes here between Tāshkīnt and\r\n   Shāhrukhiya. _Cf._ f. 2 and note to Fanākat.\r\n\r\n   [74] He left the hill-country above Sūkh in Muḥarram 910 AH.\r\n   (mid-June 1504 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [75] For a good account of Khujand _see_ Kostenko i, 346.\r\n\r\n   [76] Khujand to Andijān 187 m. 2 fur.

MS.,\r\n   M:nūgh:l; Pers. trans. and Mems., Myoghil; Ilminsky, M:tugh:l;\r\n   _Méms._ Mtoughuil; Réclus, Schuyler and Kostenko, Mogul Tau;\r\n   Nalivkine, \"d'apres Fedtschenko,\" Mont Mogol; Fr. Map of 1904,\r\n   M. Muzbek. It is the western end of the Kurāma Range (Kīndīr\r\n   Tau), which comes out to the bed of the Sīr, is 26-2/3 miles\r\n   long and rises to 4000 ft. (Kostenko, i, 101). Von Schwarz\r\n   describes it as being quite bare; various writers ascribe\r\n   climatic evil to it.\r\n\r\n   [81] Pers. trans. _ahū-i-safed_. _Cf._ f. 3b note.\r\n\r\n   [82] These words translate into _Cervus marāl_, the Asiatic\r\n   Wapiti, and to this Bābur may apply them. Dictionaries explain\r\n   _marāl_ as meaning _hind_ or _doe_ but numerous books of\r\n   travel and Natural History show that it has wider application\r\n   as a generic name, _i.e._ deer. The two words _būghū_ and\r\n   _marāl_ appear to me to be used as _e.g._ drake and duck are\r\n   used. _Marāl_ and duck can both imply the female sex, but also\r\n   both are generic, perhaps primarily so. _Cf._ for further\r\n   mention of _būghū-marāl_ f. 219 and f. 276. For uses of the\r\n   word _marāl_, _see_ the writings _e.g._ of Atkinson, Kostenko\r\n   (iii, 69), Lyddeker, Littledale, Selous, Ronaldshay, Church\r\n   (Chinese Turkistan), Biddulph (Forsyth's Mission).\r\n\r\n   [83] _Cf._ f. 2 and note.\r\n\r\n   [84] Schuyler (ii, 3), 18 m.\r\n\r\n   [85] Ḥai. MS. _Hamesha bū deshttā yīl bār dūr. Marghīnānghā\r\n   kīm sharqī dūr, hamesha mūndīn yīl bārūr; Khujandghā kīm\r\n   gharībī dūr, dā'im mūndīn yīl kīlūr._\r\n\r\n   This is a puzzling passage. It seems to say that wind always\r\n   goes east and west from the steppe as from a generating\r\n   centre. E. and de C. have given it alternative directions,\r\n   east or west, but there is little point in saying this of wind\r\n   in a valley hemmed in on the north and the south. Bābur limits\r\n   his statement to the steppe lying in the contracted mouth of\r\n   the Farghāna valley (_pace_ Schuyler ii, 51) where special\r\n   climatic conditions exist such as (_a_) difference in\r\n   temperature on the two sides of the Khujand narrows and\r\n   currents resulting from this difference,—(_b_) the heating of\r\n   the narrows by sun-heat reflected from the Mogol-tau,—and\r\n   (_c_) the inrush of westerly wind over Mīrzā Rabāṯ. Local\r\n   knowledge only can guide a translator safely but Bābur's\r\n   directness of speech compels belief in the significance of his\r\n   words and this particularly when what he says is unexpected.\r\n   He calls the Hā Darwesh a whirling wind and this it still is.\r\n   Thinkable at least it is that a strong westerly current (the\r\n   prevailing wind of Farghāna) entering over Mīrzā Rabāṯ and\r\n   becoming, as it does become, the whirlwind of Hā Darwesh on\r\n   the hemmed-in steppe,—becoming so perhaps by conflict with the\r\n   hotter indraught through the Gates of Khujand—might force that\r\n   indraught back into the Khujand Narrows (in the way _e.g._\r\n   that one Nile in flood forces back the other), and at Khujand\r\n   create an easterly current. All the manuscripts agree in\r\n   writing to (_ghā_) Marghīnān and to (_ghā_) Khujand. It may be\r\n   observed that, looking at the map, it appears somewhat strange\r\n   that Bābur should take, for his wind objective, a place so\r\n   distant from his (defined) Hā Darwesh and seemingly so\r\n   screened by its near hills as is Marghīnān. But that westerly\r\n   winds are prevalent in Marghīnān is seen _e.g._ in\r\n   Middendorff's _Einblikke in den Farghāna Thal_ (p. 112). _Cf._\r\n   Réclus vi, 547; Schuyler ii, 51; Cahun's _Histoire du Khanat\r\n   de Khokand_ p. 28 and Sven Hedin's _Durch Asien's Wüsten s.n.\r\n   būrān_.\r\n\r\n   [86] _bādiy__a_; a word perhaps selected as punning on _bād_,\r\n   wind.\r\n\r\n   [87] _i.e._ Akhsī Village. This word is sometimes spelled\r\n   Akhsīkīs̤ but as the old name of the place was Akhsī-kīnt, it\r\n   may be conjectured at least that the _s̤ā'ī mas̤allas̤a_ of\r\n   Akhsīkīs̤ represents the three points due for the _nūn_ and\r\n   _tā_ of _kīnt_. Of those writing Akhsīkīt may be mentioned the\r\n   Ḥai. and Kehr's MSS. (the Elph. MS. here has a lacuna) the\r\n   _Z̤afar-nāma_ (Bib. Ind. i, 44) and Ibn Haukal (Ouseley p.\r\n   270); and of those writing the word with the _s̤ā'ī\r\n   muṣallas̤a_ (_i.e._ as Akhsīkīs̤), Yāqūt's Dict, i, 162,\r\n   Reinaud's Abū'l-feda I. ii, 225-6, Ilminsky (p. 5) departing\r\n   from his source, and I.O. Cat. (Ethé) No. 1029. It may be\r\n   observed that Ibn Haukal (Ouseley p. 280) writes Banākaṣ for\r\n   Banākat. For As̤īru'd-dīn _Akhsīkītī_, _see_ Rieu ii, 563;\r\n   Daulat Shāh (Browne) p. 121 and Ethé I.O. Cat. No. 1029.\r\n\r\n   [88] Measured on the French military map of 1904, this may be\r\n   80 kil. _i.e._ 50 miles.\r\n\r\n   [89] Concerning several difficult passages in the rest of\r\n   Bābur's account of Akhsī, _see_ Appendix A.\r\n\r\n   [90] The W.-i-B. here translates _būghū-marāl_ by _gazawn_ and\r\n   the same word is entered, under-line, in the Ḥai. MS. _Cf._ f.\r\n   3b and note and f. 4 and note.\r\n\r\n   [91] _postīn pesh b:r:h._ This obscure Persian phrase has been\r\n   taken in the following ways:—\r\n\r\n     (_a_) W.-i-B.

C, i, 9, _fourrure d'agneau de la première qualité_.\r\n\r\n   The \"lambskins\" of L. and E. carry on a notion of comfort\r\n   started by their having read _sayāh_, shelter, for Turkī\r\n   _sā'ī_, torrent-bed; de C. also lays stress on fur and warmth,\r\n   but would not the flowery border of a mountain stream prompt\r\n   rather a phrase bespeaking ornament and beauty than one\r\n   expressing warmth and textile softness? If the phrase might be\r\n   read as _postīn pesh perā_, what adorns the front of a coat,\r\n   or as _postīn pesh bar rah_, the fine front of the coat, the\r\n   phrase would recall the gay embroidered front of some leathern\r\n   postins.\r\n\r\n   [92] Var. _tabarkhūn_. The explanation best suiting its uses,\r\n   enumerated here, is Redhouse's second, the Red Willow. My\r\n   husband thinks it may be the Hyrcanian Willow.\r\n\r\n   [93] Steingass describes this as \"an arrow without wing or\r\n   point\" (barb?) and tapering at both ends; it may be the\r\n   practising arrow, _t`alīm aūqī_, often headless.\r\n\r\n   [94] _tabarraklūq._ Cf. f. 48b foot, for the same use of the\r\n   word.\r\n\r\n   [95] _yabrūju'ṣ-ṣannam._ The books referred to by Bābur may\r\n   well be the _Rauzatu'ṣ-ṣafā_ and the _Ḥabību's-siyār_, as\r\n   both mention the plant.\r\n\r\n   [96] The Turkī word _āyīq_ is explained by Redhouse as _awake_\r\n   and _alert_; and by Meninski and de Meynard as _sobered_ and\r\n   as _a return to right senses_. It may be used here as a\r\n   equivalent of _mihr_ in _mihr-giyāh_, the plant of love.\r\n\r\n   [97] Mr. Ney Elias has discussed the position of this group of\r\n   seven villages. (_Cf._ T. R. p. 180 n.) Arrowsmith's map\r\n   places it (as Iti-kint) approximately where Mr. Th. Radloff\r\n   describes seeing it _i.e._ on the Farghāna slope of the Kurāma\r\n   range. (_Cf. Réceuil d'Itinéraires_ p. 188.) Mr. Th. Radloff\r\n   came into Yītī-kīnt after crossing the Kīndīrlīk Pass from\r\n   Tāshkīnt and he enumerates the seven villages as traversed by\r\n   him before reaching the Sīr. It is hardly necessary to say\r\n   that the actual villages he names may not be those of Bābur's\r\n   Yītī-kint. Wherever the word is used in the _Bābur-nāma_ and\r\n   the _Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_, it appears from the context allowable\r\n   to accept Mr. Radloff's location but it should be borne in\r\n   mind that the name Yītī-kīnt (Seven villages or towns) might\r\n   be found as an occasional name of Altī-shahr (Six towns).\r\n   _See_ T.R. _s.n._ Altī-shahr.\r\n\r\n   [98] _kīshī_, person, here manifestly fighting men.\r\n\r\n   [99] Elph.

Codex but also Shaibānī's Boswell, Muḥammad Ṣāliḥ Mīrzā.\r\n   The Elph. MS. frequently uses _Shaibāq_ but its authority down\r\n   to f. 198 (Ḥai. MS. f. 243b) is not so great as it is after\r\n   that folio, because not till f. 198 is it a direct copy of\r\n   Bābur's own. It may be more correct to write \"the Shaibānī\r\n   Khān\" and perhaps even \"the Shaibānī.\"\r\n\r\n   [100] _bī murād_, so translated because retirement was caused\r\n   once by the overruling of Khwāja `Ubaidu'l-lāh _Aḥrārī_. (T.R.\r\n   p. 113.)\r\n\r\n   [101] Once the Mīrzā did not wish Yūnas to winter in Akhsī;\r\n   once did not expect him to yield to the demand of his Mughūls\r\n   to be led out of the cultivated country (_wilāyat_). His own\r\n   misconduct included his attack in Yūnas on account of Akhsī\r\n   and much falling-out with kinsmen. (T.R. _s.nn._)\r\n\r\n   [102] _i.e._ one made of non-warping wood (Steingass), perhaps\r\n   that of the White Poplar. The _Shāh-nāma_ (Turner, Maçon ed.\r\n   i, 71) writes of a Chāchī bow and arrows of _khadang_, _i.e._\r\n   white poplar. (H.B.)\r\n\r\n   [103] _i.e._ Rābī`a-sulṯān, married _circa_ 893 AH.-1488 AD.\r\n   For particulars about her and all women mentioned in the B.N.\r\n   and the T.R. see Gulbadan Begīm's _Humāyūn-nāma_, Or. Trs.\r\n   Series.\r\n\r\n   [104] _jar_, either that of the Kāsān Water or of a\r\n   deeply-excavated canal. The palace buildings are mentioned\r\n   again on f. 110b. _Cf._ Appendix A.\r\n\r\n   [105] _i.e._ soared from earth, died. For some details of the\r\n   accident _see_ A.N. (H. Beveridge, i, 220.)\r\n\r\n   [106] Ḥ.S. ii,-192, Firishta, lith. ed. p. 191 and D'Herbélot,\r\n   sixth.\r\n\r\n   It would have accorded with Bābur's custom if here he had\r\n   mentioned the parentage of his father's mother. Three times\r\n   (fs. 17b, 70b, 96b) he writes of \"Shāh Sulṯan Begīm\" in a way\r\n   allowing her to be taken as `Umar Shaikh's own mother.\r\n   Nowhere, however, does he mention her parentage. One even\r\n   cognate statement only have we discovered, _viz._\r\n   Khwānd-amīr's (Ḥ.S. ii, 192) that `Umar Shaikh was the own\r\n   younger brother (_barādar khurdtar khūd_) of Aḥmad and Maḥmūd.\r\n   If his words mean that the three were full-brothers, `Umar\r\n   Shaikh's own mother was Ābū-sa`īd's Tarkhān wife. Bābur's\r\n   omission (f. 21b) to mention his father with A. and M. as a\r\n   nephew of Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān would be negative testimony\r\n   against taking Khwānd-amīr's statement to mean \"full-brother,\"\r\n   if clerical slips were not easy and if Khwānd-amir's means of\r\n   information were less good. He however both was the son of\r\n   Maḥmūd's wāzir (Ḥ.S. ii, 194) and supplemented his book in\r\n   Bābur's presence.\r\n\r\n   To a statement made by the writer of the biographies included\r\n   in Kehr's B.N. volume, that `U.S.'s family (_aūmāgh_) is not\r\n   known, no weight can be attached, spite of the co-incidence\r\n   that the Mongol form of _aūmāgh_, _i.e._ _aūmāk_ means\r\n   _Mutter-leib_. The biographies contain too many known mistakes\r\n   for their compiler to outweigh Khwānd-amīr in authority.\r\n\r\n   [107] _Cf._ _Rauzatu'ṣ-ṣafā_ vi, 266. (H.B.)\r\n\r\n   [108] Dara-i-gaz, south of Balkh. This historic feast took\r\n   place at Merv in 870 AH. (1465 AD.). As `Umar Shaikh was then\r\n   under ten, he may have been one of the Mīrzās concerned.\r\n\r\n   [109] Khudāī-bīrdī is a Pers.-Turkī hybrid equivalent of\r\n   Theodore; _tūghchī_ implies the right to use or (as hereditary\r\n   standard-bearer,) to guard the _tūgh_; Timūr-tāsh may mean\r\n   _i.a._ Friend of Tīmūr (a title not excluded here as borne by\r\n   inheritance. _Cf._ f. 12b and note), Sword-friend (_i.e._\r\n   Companion-in-arms), and Iron-friend (_i.e._ stanch). _Cf._\r\n   Dict. _s.n._ Tīmūr-bāsh, a sobriquet of Charles XII.\r\n\r\n   [110] Elph. and Ḥai.

The four earlier trss. _viz._ the two W.-i-B.,\r\n   the English and the French, have variants in this passage.\r\n\r\n   [111] The apposition may be between placing the turban-sash\r\n   round the turban-cap in a single flat fold and winding it four\r\n   times round after twisting it on itself. _Cf._ f. 18 and\r\n   Hughes _Dict. of Islām s.n._ turban.\r\n\r\n   [112] _qaẓālār_, the prayers and fasts omitted when due,\r\n   through war, travel sickness, etc.\r\n\r\n   [113] _rawān sawādī bār īdī_; perhaps, wrote a running hand.\r\n   De C. i, 13, _ses lectures courantes étaient...._\r\n\r\n   [114] The dates of `Umar Shaikh's limits of perusal allow the\r\n   Quintets (_Khamsatīn_) here referred to to be those of Niẕāmī\r\n   and Amīr Khusrau of Dihlī. The _Maṣnawī_ must be that of\r\n   Jalālu'd-dīn _Rūmī_. (H.B.)\r\n\r\n   [115] Probably below the Tīrāk (Poplar) Pass, the caravan\r\n   route much exposed to avalanches.\r\n\r\n   Mr. Erskine notes that this anecdote is erroneously told as of\r\n   Bābur by Firishta and others. Perhaps it has been confused\r\n   with the episode on f. 207b. Firishta makes another mistaken\r\n   attribution to Bābur, that of Ḥasan of Yaq`ūb's couplet.\r\n   (H.B.) _Cf._ f. 13b and Dow's _Hindustan_ ii, 218.\r\n\r\n   [116] _yīgītlār_, young men, the modern _jighit_. Bābur uses\r\n   the word for men on the effective fighting strength. It\r\n   answers to the \"brave\" of North. American Indian story; here\r\n   de C. translates it by _braves_.\r\n\r\n   [117] _ma`jūn._ _Cf._ Von Schwarz p. 286 for a recipe.\r\n\r\n   [118] _mutaiyam._ This word, not clearly written in all MSS.,\r\n   has been mistaken for _yītīm_. _Cf._ JRAS 1910 p. 882 for a\r\n   note upon it by my husband to whom I owe the emendation.\r\n\r\n   [119] _na'l u dāghī bisyār īdī_, that is, he had inflicted on\r\n   himself many of the brands made by lovers and enthusiasts.\r\n   _Cf._ Chardin's _Voyages_ ii, 253 and Lady M. Montague's\r\n   _Letters_ p. 200.\r\n\r\n   [120] _tīka sīkrītkū_, lit. likely to make goats leap, from\r\n   _sīkrīmāk_ to jump close-footed (Shaw).\r\n\r\n   [121] _sīkrīkān dūr._ Both _sīkrītkū_ and _sīkrīkān dūr_,\r\n   appear to dictate translation in general terms and not by\r\n   reference to a single traditional leap by one goat.\r\n\r\n   [122] _i.e._ Russian; it is the Arys tributary of the Sīr.\r\n\r\n   [123] The Fr. map of 1904 shows Kas, in the elbow of the Sīr,\r\n   which seems to represent Khwāṣ.\r\n\r\n   [124] _i.e._ the Chīr-chīk tributary of the Sīr.\r\n\r\n   [125] Concerning his name, _see_ T.R. p. 173.\r\n\r\n   [126] _i.e._ he was a head-man of a horde sub-division,\r\n   nominally numbering 10,000, and paying their dues direct to\r\n   the supreme Khān. (T.R. p. 301.)\r\n\r\n   [127] _ghūnchachī i.e._ one ranking next to the four legal\r\n   wives, in Turkī _aūdālīq_, whence odalisque. Bābur and\r\n   Gul-badan mention the promotion of several to Begīm's rank by\r\n   virtue of their motherhood.\r\n\r\n   [128] One of Bābur's quatrains, quoted in the _Abūshqa_, is\r\n   almost certainly addressed to Khān-zāda. _Cf._ A.Q. Review,\r\n   Jan. 1911, p. 4; H. Beveridge's _Some verses of Bābur_. For an\r\n   account of her marriage _see Shaibānī-nāma_ (Vambéry) cap.\r\n   xxxix.\r\n\r\n   [129] Kehr's MS. has a passage here not found elsewhere and\r\n   seeming to be an adaptation of what is at the top of Ḥai. MS.\r\n   f. 88. (Ilminsky, p. 10, _ba wujūd ... tāpīb_.)\r\n\r\n   [130] _tūshtī_, which here seems to mean that she fell to his\r\n   share on division of captives. Muḥ. Ṣaliḥ makes it a\r\n   love-match and places the marriage before Bābur's departure.\r\n   _Cf._ f. 95 and notes.\r\n\r\n   [131] _aūgāhlān._ Khurram would be about five when given Balkh\r\n   in _circa_ 911 AH. (1505 AD.). He died when about 12. _Cf._\r\n   Ḥ.S. ii, 364.\r\n\r\n   [132] This _fatrat_ (interregnum) was between Bābur's loss of\r\n   Farghāna and his gain of Kābul; the _furṣatlār_ were his days\r\n   of ease following success in Hindūstān and allowing his book\r\n   to be written.\r\n\r\n   [133] _qīlālīng_, lit. do thou be (setting down), a verbal\r\n   form recurring on f. 227b l. 2. With the same form\r\n   (_aīt_)_ālīng_, lit. do thou be saying, the compiler of the\r\n   _Abūshqa_ introduces his quotations. Shaw's paradigm, _qīlīng_\r\n   only. _Cf._ A.Q.R. Jan. 1911, p. 2.\r\n\r\n   [134] Kehr's MS. (Ilminsky p. 12) and its derivatives here\r\n   interpolate the erroneous statement that the sons of Yūnas\r\n   were Afāq and Bābā Khāns.\r\n\r\n   [135] _i.e._ broke up the horde. _Cf._ T.R. p. 74.\r\n\r\n   [136] _See_ f. 50b for his descent.\r\n\r\n   [137] Descendants of these captives were in Kāshghar when\r\n   Ḥaidar was writing the T.R. It was completed in 953 AH. (1547\r\n   AD.). _Cf._ T.R. pp. 81 and 149.\r\n\r\n   [138] An omission from his Persian source misled Mr. Erskine\r\n   here into making Abū-sa`īd celebrate the Khānīm's marriage,\r\n   not with himself but with his defeated foe, `Abdu'l-`azīz who\r\n   had married her 28 years earlier.\r\n\r\n   [139] Aīsān-būghā was at Āq Sū in Eastern Turkistān; Yūnas\r\n   Khān's head-quarters were in Yītī-kīnt. The Sāghārīchī _tūmān_\r\n   was a subdivision of the Kūnchī Mughūls.\r\n\r\n   [140] _Khān kūtārdīlār._ The primitive custom was to lift the\r\n   Khān-designate off the ground; the phrase became metaphorical\r\n   and would seem to be so here, since there were two upon the\r\n   felt. _Cf._, however, Th. Radloff's _Récueil d'Itinéraires_ p.\r\n   326.\r\n\r\n   [141] _qūyūb īdī_, probably in childhood.\r\n\r\n   [142] She was divorced by Shaibānī Khān in 907 AH. in order to\r\n   allow him to make lawful marriage with her niece, Khān-zāda.\r\n\r\n   [143] This was a prudential retreat before Shaibānī Khān.\r\n   _Cf._ f. 213.\r\n\r\n   [144] The \"Khān\" of his title bespeaks his Chaghatāī-Mughūl\r\n   descent through his mother, the \"Mīrzā,\" his Tīmūrid-Turkī,\r\n   through his father. The capture of the women was facilitated\r\n   by the weakening of their travelling escort through his\r\n   departure. _Cf._ T.R. p. 203.\r\n\r\n   [145] Qila`-i-ẕafar. Its ruins are still to be seen on the\r\n   left bank of the Kukcha. _Cf._ T.R. p. 220 and Kostenko i,\r\n   140. For Mubārak Shāh _Muẓaffarī_ _see_ f. 213 and T.R. _s.n._\r\n\r\n   [146] Ḥabība, a child when captured, was reared by Shaibānī\r\n   and by him given in marriage to his nephew. _Cf._ T.R. p. 207\r\n   for an account of this marriage as saving Ḥaidar's life.\r\n\r\n   [147] _i.e._ she did not take to flight with her husband's\r\n   defeated force, but, relying on the victor, her cousin Bābur,\r\n   remained in the town. _Cf._ T.R. p. 268. Her case receives\r\n   light from Shahr-bānū's (f. 169).\r\n\r\n   [148] Muḥammad Ḥaidar Mīrzā _Kūrkān Dūghlāt Chaghatāī Mūghūl_,\r\n   the author of the _Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_; b. 905 AH. d. 958 AH.\r\n   (b. 1499 d. 1551 AD.). Of his clan, the \"Oghlāt\" (Dūghlāt)\r\n   Muḥ. ṣāliḥ says that it was called \"Oghlāt\" by Mughūls but\r\n   Qūngūr-āt (Brown Horse) by Aūzbegs.\r\n\r\n   [149] _Baz garadad ba aṣl-i-khūd hama chīz,\r\n         Zar-i-ṣāfī u naqra u airzīn._\r\n\r\n   These lines are in Arabic in the introduction to the\r\n   _Anwār-i-suhailī_. (H.B.) The first is quoted by Ḥaidar (T.R.\r\n   p. 354) and in Field's _Dict. of Oriental Quotations_ (p.\r\n   160). I understand them to refer here to Ḥaidar's return to\r\n   his ancestral home and nearest kin as being a natural act.\r\n\r\n   [150] _tā'ib_ and _ṯarīqā_ suggest that Ḥaidar had become an\r\n   orthodox Musalmān in or about 933 AH. (1527 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [151] Abū'l-faẓl adds music to Ḥaidar's accomplishments and\r\n   Ḥaidar's own Prologue mentions yet others.\r\n\r\n   [152] _Cf._ T.R. _s.n._ and Gul-badan's H.N. _s.n._ Ḥaram\r\n   Begīm.\r\n\r\n   [153] _i.e._ Alexander of Macedon. For modern mention of\r\n   Central Asian claims to Greek descent _see i.a._ Kostenko, Von\r\n   Schwarz, Holdich and A. Durand. _Cf._ Burnes' _Kābul_ p. 203\r\n   for an illustration of a silver _patera_ (now in the V. and A.\r\n   Museum), once owned by ancestors of this Shāh Sulṯān Muḥammad.\r\n\r\n   [154] _Cf._ f. 6b note.\r\n\r\n   [155] _i.e._ Khān's child.\r\n\r\n   [156] The careful pointing of the Ḥai. MS. clears up earlier\r\n   confusion by showing the narrowing of the vowels from _ālāchī_\r\n   to _alacha_.\r\n\r\n   [157] The Elph. MS. (f. 7) writes _Aūng_, Khān's son, Prester\r\n   John's title, where other MSS. have Adik. Bābur's brevity has\r\n   confused his account of Sulṯān-nigār. Widowed of Maḥmūd in 900\r\n   AH. she married Adik; Adik, later, joined Shaibānī Khān but\r\n   left him in 908 AH. perhaps secretly, to join his own Qāzāq\r\n   horde. He was followed by his wife, apparently also making a\r\n   private departure. As Adik died shortly after 908 AH. his\r\n   daughters were born before that date and not after it as has\r\n   been understood. _Cf._ T.R. and G.B.'s H.N. _s.nn._; also\r\n   Mems. p. 14 and _Méms._ i, 24.\r\n\r\n   [158] Presumably by tribal custom, _yīnkālīk_, marriage with a\r\n   brother's widow. Such marriages seem to have been made\r\n   frequently for the protection of women left defenceless.\r\n\r\n   [159] Sa`īd's power to protect made him the refuge of several\r\n   kinswomen mentioned in the B.N. and the T.R. This mother and\r\n   child reached Kāshghar in 932 AH. (1526 AD.).\r\n\r\n   Here Bābur ends his [interpolated] account of his mother's\r\n   family and resumes that of his father's.\r\n\r\n   [160] Bābur uses a variety of phrases to express Lordship in\r\n   the Gate. Here he writes _aīshīknī bāshlātīb_; elsewhere,\r\n   _aīshīk ikhtiyārī qīlmāq_ and _mīnīng aīshīkīmdā ṣāḥib\r\n   ikhtiyārī qīlmāq_. Von Schwarz (p. 159) throws light on the\r\n   duties of the Lord of the Gate (_Aīshīk Āghāsī_). \"Das Thür\r\n   ... führt in eine grosse, vier-eckige, höhe Halle, deren Boden\r\n   etwa 2 m. über den Weg erhoben ist. In dieser Halle, welche\r\n   alle passieren muss, der durch das Thor eingeht, reitet oder\r\n   fahrt, ist die Thorwache placiert. Tagsüber sind die Thore\r\n   beständig öffen, nach Eintritt der Dunkelheit aber werden\r\n   dieselben geschlossen und die Schlüssel dem zuständigen\r\n   Polizeichef abgeliefert.... In den erwähnten Thorhallen nehmen\r\n   in den hoch unabhängigen Gebieten an Bazar-tagen haufig die\r\n   Richter Platz, um jedem der irgend ein Anliegen hat, so fort\r\n   Recht zu sprechen.

Moreover the only\r\n   accusative of the participle and of the verb is _khabarnī_.\r\n   `Abdu'l-wahhāb had been `Umar Shaikh's and was now Aḥmad's\r\n   officer in Khujand, on the main road for Aūrā-tīpā whence the\r\n   courier started on the rapid ride.

The couplet appears to be addressed\r\n   to some man, under the name Hūma, from whom Ḥasan of Yaq`ūb\r\n   hoped for benefit.\r\n\r\n   [166] _khāk-bīla_; the _Sanglākh_, (quoting this passage)\r\n   gives _khāk-p:l:k_ as the correct form of the word.\r\n\r\n   [167] _Cf._ f. 99b.\r\n\r\n   [168] One of Tīmūr's begs.\r\n\r\n   [169] _i.e._ uncle on the mother's side, of any degree, here a\r\n   grandmother's brother. The title appears to have been given\r\n   for life to men related to the ruling House. Parallel with it\r\n   are Madame Mère, Royal Uncle, Sulṯān Wālida.\r\n\r\n   [170] _kīm dīsā būlghāī_, perhaps meaning, \"Nothing of service\r\n   to me.\"\r\n\r\n   [171] Wais the Thin.\r\n\r\n   [172] _Cf._ Chardin ed.

Ḥai MS., erroneously,\r\n   Samarkand.\r\n\r\n   [174] An occasional doubt arises as to whether a _ṯaurī_ of\r\n   the text is Arabic and dispraises or Turkī and laudatory.\r\n   _Cf._ Mems. p. 17 and _Méms._ i, 3.\r\n\r\n   [175] Elph. and Ḥai. MSS. _aftābachī_, water-bottle bearer on\r\n   journeys; Kehr (p. 82) _aftābchī_, ewer-bearer; Ilminsky (p.\r\n   19) _akhtachi_, squire or groom. Circumstances support\r\n   _aftābachī_. Yūnas was town-bred, his ewer-bearer would hardly\r\n   be the rough Mughūl, Qaṃbar-`alī, useful as an _aftābachī_.\r\n\r\n   [176] Bābur was Governor of Andijān and the month being June,\r\n   would be living out-of-doors. _Cf._ Ḥ.S. ii. 272 and Schuyler\r\n   ii, 37.\r\n\r\n   [177] To the word Sherīm applies Abū'l-ghāzī's explanation of\r\n   Nurūm and Ḥājīm, namely, that they are abbreviations of Nūr\r\n   and Ḥājī Muḥammad. It explains Sulṯānīm also when used (f. 72)\r\n   of Sl. Muḥammad Khānika but of Sulṯānīm as the name is common\r\n   with Bābur, Ḥaidar and Gul-badan, _i.e._ as a woman's,\r\n   Busbecq's explanation is the better, namely, that it means My\r\n   Sulṯān and is applied to a person of rank and means. This\r\n   explains other women's titles _e.g._ Khānīm, my Khān and Ākām\r\n   (Ākīm), My Lady. A third group of names formed like the last\r\n   by enclitic _'m_ (my), may be called names of affection,\r\n   _e.g._ Māhīm, My Moon, Jānīm, My Life. (_Cf._ Persian\r\n   equivalents.) Cf. Abū'l-ghāzī's _Shajarat-i-Turkī_ (Désmaisons\r\n   p. 272); and Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq's _Life and Letters_\r\n   (Forster and Daniel i, 38.)\r\n\r\n   [178] _Namāz-gāh_; generally an open terrace, with a wall\r\n   towards the Qibla and outside the town, whither on festival\r\n   days the people go out in crowds to pray. (Erskine.)\r\n\r\n   [179] _Bēglār (nīng) mīnī u wilāyatnī tāpshūrghūlārī dūr_;\r\n   a noticeably idiomatic sentence. _Cf._ f. 16b 1. 6 and 1. 7\r\n   for a repetition.\r\n\r\n   [180] Maḥmūd was in Tāshkīnt, Aḥmad in Kāshghār or on the\r\n   Āq-sū.\r\n\r\n   [181] The B.N. contains a considerable number of what are\r\n   virtually footnotes. They are sometimes, as here, entered in\r\n   the middle of a sentence and confuse the narrative; they are\r\n   introduced by _kīm_, a mere sign of parenthetical matter to\r\n   follow, and some certainly, known not to be Bābur's own, must\r\n   have stood first on the margin of his text. It seems best to\r\n   enter them as Author's notes.\r\n\r\n   [182] _i.e._ the author of the Hidāyat. _Cf._ f. 3b and note;\r\n   Blochmann _Āyīn-i-akbarī s.n. qulij_ and note; Bellew's\r\n   _Afghan Tribes_ p. 100, _Khilich_.\r\n\r\n   [183] Ar. dead, gone. The precision of Bābur's words\r\n   _khānwādalār_ and _yūsūnlūq_ is illustrated by the existence\r\n   in the days of Tīmūr, in Marghīnān, (Burhānu'd-dīn's township)\r\n   of a ruler named Aīlīk Khān, apparently a descendant of\r\n   Sātūq-būghrā Khān (b. 384 AH.-994 AD.) so that in Khwāja Qāẓī\r\n   were united two dynasties, (_khānwādalār_), one priestly,\r\n   perhaps also regal, the other of bye-gone ruling Khāns. Cf.\r\n   D'Herbélot p. 433; _Yarkand Mission_, Bellew p. 121;\r\n   _Taẕkirat-i Sulṯān Sātūq-būghrā Khān Ghāzī Pādshāh_ and\r\n   _Tārīkh-i-nāṣirī_ (Raverty _s.n._)\r\n\r\n   [184] _darzī_; Ḥ.S. _khaiyāṯ_.\r\n\r\n   [185] _bīr yīrgā_ (_qūyūb_), lit. to one place.\r\n\r\n   [186] _i.e._ reconstructed the earthern defences. _Cf._ Von\r\n   Schwarz _s.n._ loess.\r\n\r\n   [187] They had been sent, presumably, before `Umar Shaikh's\r\n   death, to observe Sl. Aḥmad M.'s advance. _Cf._ f. 6.\r\n\r\n   [188] The time-table of the Andijān Railway has a station,\r\n   Kouwa (Qabā).\r\n\r\n   [189] Bābur, always I think, calls this man Long Ḥasan;\r\n   Khwānd-amīr styles him Khwāja Ḥasan; he seems to be the\r\n   brother of one of `Umar Shaikh's fathers-in-law, Khwāja\r\n   Ḥusain.\r\n\r\n   [190] _bātqāq._ This word is underlined in the Elph. MS. by\r\n   _dil-dil_ and in the Ḥai. MS. by _jam-jama_. It is translated\r\n   in the W.-i-B. by _āb pur hīla_, water full of deceit; it is\r\n   our Slough of Despond. It may be remarked that neither Zenker\r\n   nor Steingass gives to _dil-dil_ or _jam-jama_ the meaning of\r\n   morass; the _Akbar-nāma_ does so. (H.B. ii, 112.)\r\n\r\n   [191] _ṯawīla ṯawīla ātlār yīghīlīb aūlā kīrīshtī_. I\r\n   understand the word _yīghīlīb_ to convey that the massing led\r\n   to the spread of the murrain.\r\n\r\n   [192] _jān tārātmāqlār_ _i.e._ as a gift to their over-lord.\r\n\r\n   [193] Perhaps, Bābur's maternal great-uncle. It would suit the\r\n   privileges bestowed on Tarkhāns if their title meant _Khān of\r\n   the Gifts_ (Turkī _tar_, gift). In the _Bāburnāma_, it\r\n   excludes all others. Most of Aḥmad's begs were Tarkhāns,\r\n   Arghūns and Chīngīz Khānids, some of them ancestors of later\r\n   rulers in Tatta and Sind. Concerning the Tarkhāns _see_ T.R.\r\n   p. 55 and note; A.N.

Aḥmad would appear to have\r\n   maintained the deferential attitude by kneeling and sitting\r\n   back upon his heels.\r\n\r\n   [200] _bīr sūnkāk bār īkān dūr._ I understand that something\r\n   defiling must have been there, perhaps a bone.\r\n\r\n   [201] _Khwājanīng ham āyāghlārī ārādā īdī._\r\n\r\n   [202] _īlbāsūn_, a kind of mallard (_Abūshqa_), here perhaps a\r\n   popinjay. _Cf._ Ḥ.S. ii, 193 for Aḥmad's skill as an archer,\r\n   and Payne-Gallwey's _Cross-bow_ p. 225.\r\n\r\n   [203] _qabāq_, an archer's mark. Abū'l-ghāzī (Kāsān ed. p.\r\n   181. 5) mentions a hen (_tūqūq_) as a mark. _Cf._\r\n   Payne-Gallwey _l.c._ p. 231.\r\n\r\n   [204] _qīrghīcha, astar palumbarius._ (Shaw's Voc. Scully.)\r\n\r\n   [205] Perhaps, not quarrelsome.\r\n\r\n   [206] The T.R. (p. 116) attributes the rout to Shaibānī's\r\n   defection. The Ḥ.S. (ii, 192) has a varied and confused\r\n   account. An error in the T.R. trs. making Shaibānī plunder the\r\n   Mughūls, is manifestly clerical.\r\n\r\n   [207] _i.e._ condiment, _ce qu'on ajoute au pain_.\r\n\r\n   [208] _Cf._ f. 6.\r\n\r\n   [209] _qāzāqlār_; here, if Bābur's, meaning his conflicts with\r\n   Taṃbal, but as the Begīm may have been some time in Khujand,\r\n   the _qāzāqlār_ may be of Samarkand.\r\n\r\n   [210] All the (Turkī) Bābur-nāma MSS. and those examined of\r\n   the W.-i-B. by writing _aūltūrdī_ (killed) where I suggest to\r\n   read _aūlnūrdī_ (_devenir comme il faut_) state that Aḥmad\r\n   killed Qātāq. I hesitate to accept this (1) because the only\r\n   evidence of the murder is one diacritical point, the removal\r\n   of which lifts Aḥmad's reproach from him by his return to the\r\n   accepted rules of a polygamous household; (2) because no\r\n   murder of Qātāq is chronicled by Khwānd-amīr or other writers;\r\n   and (3) because it is incredible that a mild, weak man living\r\n   in a family atmosphere such as Bābur, Ḥaidar and Gul-badan\r\n   reproduce for us, should, while possessing facility for\r\n   divorce, kill the mother of four out of his five children.\r\n\r\n   Reprieve must wait however until the word _tīrīklīk_ is\r\n   considered. This Erskine and de C. have read, with\r\n   consistency, to mean _life-time_, but if _aūlnūrdī_ be read in\r\n   place of _aūltūrdī_ (killed), _tīrīklīk_ may be read,\r\n   especially in conjunction with Bābur's _`āshīqlīklār_, as\r\n   meaning _living power_ or _ascendancy_. Again, if read as from\r\n   _tīrik_, a small arrow and a consuming pain, _tīrīklīk_ may\r\n   represent Cupid's darts and wounds. Again it might be taken as\r\n   from _tīrāmāk_, to hinder, or forbid.\r\n\r\n   Under these considerations, it is legitimate to reserve\r\n   judgment on Aḥmad.\r\n\r\n   [211] It is customary amongst Turks for a bride, even amongst\r\n   her own family, to remain veiled for some time after marriage;\r\n   a child is then told to pluck off the veil and run away, this\r\n   tending, it is fancied, to the child's own success in\r\n   marriage. (Erskine.)\r\n\r\n   [212] Bābur's anecdote about Jānī Beg well illustrates his\r\n   caution as a narrator. He appears to tell it as one who\r\n   knowing the point of a story, leads up to it. He does not\r\n   affirm that Jānī Beg's habits were strange or that the envoy\r\n   was an athlete but that both things must have been (_īkān\r\n   dūr_) from what he had heard or to suit the point of the\r\n   anecdote. Nor does he affirm as of his own knowledge that\r\n   Aūzbegs calls a strong man (his _zor kīshī_) a _būkuh_ (bull)\r\n   but says it is so understood (_dīr īmīsh_).\r\n\r\n   [213] _Cf._ f. 170.\r\n\r\n   [214] The points of a _tīpūchāq_ are variously stated. If the\r\n   root notion of the name be movement (_tīp_), Erskine's\r\n   observation, that these horses are taught special paces, is to\r\n   the point. To the verb _tīprāmāq_ dictionaries assign the\r\n   meaning of _movement with agitation of mind_, an explanation\r\n   fully illustrated in the B.N. The verb describes fittingly the\r\n   dainty, nervous action of some trained horses. Other meanings\r\n   assigned to _tūpūchāq_ are roadster, round-bodied and swift.\r\n\r\n   [215] _Cf._ f. 37b.\r\n\r\n   [216] _Cf._ f. 6b and note.\r\n\r\n   [217] _mashaf kitābat qīlūr īdī._\r\n\r\n   [218] _Cf._ f. 36 and Ḥ.S. ii. 271.\r\n\r\n   [219] _sīnkīlīsī ham mūndā īdī._\r\n\r\n   [220] _khāna-wādalār_, _viz._ the Chaghatāī, the Tīmūrid in\r\n   two Mīrān-shāhī branches, `Alī's and Bābur's and the Bāī-qarā\r\n   in Harāt.\r\n\r\n   [221] _aūghlāqchī_ _i.e._ player at _kūk-būrā_. Concerning the\r\n   game, _see_ Shaw's Vocabulary; Schuyler i, 268; Kostenko iii,\r\n   82; Von Schwarz _s.n. baiga_.\r\n\r\n   [222] Ẕū'l-ḥijja 910 AH.-May 1505 AD. _Cf._ f. 154. This\r\n   statement helps to define what Bābur reckoned his expeditions\r\n   into Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n   [223] Aīkū (Ayāgū)-tīmūr _Tarkhān Arghūn_ d. _circa_ 793\r\n   AH.-1391 AD. He was a friend of Tīmūr. _See_ Z̤.N. i, 525 etc.\r\n\r\n   [224] _āndāq ikhlāq u aṯawārī yūq īdī kīm dīsā būlghāī._ The\r\n   _Shāh-nāma_ cap. xviii, describes him as a spoiled child and\r\n   man of pleasure, caring only for eating, drinking and hunting.\r\n   The _Shaibānī-nāma_ narrates his various affairs.\r\n\r\n   [225] _i.e._, _cutlass_, a parallel sobriquet to _qīlīch_,\r\n   sword. If it be correct to translate by \"cutlass,\" the\r\n   nickname may have prompted Bābur's brief following comment,\r\n   _mardāna īkān dūr_, _i.e._ Qulī Muḥ. must have been brave\r\n   because known as the Cutlass. A common variant in MSS. from\r\n   _Būghdā_ is Bāghdād; Bāghdād was first written in the Ḥai. MS.\r\n   but is corrected by the scribe to _būghdā_.\r\n\r\n   [226] So pointed in the Ḥai. MS. I surmise it a clan-name.\r\n\r\n   [227] _i.e._ to offer him the succession. The mountain road\r\n   taken from Aūrā-tīpā would be by Āb-burdan, Sara-tāq and the\r\n   Kām Rūd defile.\r\n\r\n   [228] _īrīldī._ The departure can hardly have been open\r\n   because Aḥmad's begs favoured Maḥmūd; Malik-i-Muḥammad's party\r\n   would be likely to slip away in small companies.\r\n\r\n   [229] This well-known Green, Grey or Blue palace or\r\n   halting-place was within the citadel of Samarkand. _Cf._ f.\r\n   37. It served as a prison from which return was not expected.\r\n\r\n   [230] _Cf._ f. 27. He married a full-sister of Bāī-sunghar.\r\n\r\n   [231] _Gulistān_ Part I. Story 27.

The places\r\n   contrasted here are the citadel (_ark_) and the walled-town\r\n   (_qūrghān_). The _chīqār_ (exit) is the fortified Gate-house\r\n   of the mud circumvallation. _Cf._ f. 46 for another example of\r\n   _chīqār_.\r\n\r\n   [235] Elph. Ḥai.

MS. produces the statement that\r\n   when Ḥasan fled, his begs returned to Andijān.\r\n\r\n   [236] Ḥai. MS. _awī mūnkūzī_, underlined by _sāgh-i-gāū_,\r\n   cows' thatched house.

Maḥmūd _æt._ 7, was given Astarābād in 864 AH.\r\n   (1459-60 AD.); it was lost to Ḥusain at Jauz-wilāyat and\r\n   Maḥmūd went into Khurāsān in 865 AH.; he was restored by his\r\n   father in 866 AH.; on his father's death (873 AH.-1469 AD.) he\r\n   fled to Harāt, thence to Samarkand and from there was taken to\r\n   Ḥiṣār _æt._ 16. _Cf._ D'Herbélot _s.n._ Abū-sa`ad; Ḥ.S. i,\r\n   209; Browne's D.S. p. 522.\r\n\r\n   [247] Presumably the \"Hindūstān the Less\" of Clavijo (Markham\r\n   p. 3 and p. 113), approx. Qaṃbar-`alī's districts. Clavijo\r\n   includes Tīrmīẕ under the name.\r\n\r\n   [248] Perhaps a Ṣufī term,—longing for the absent friend. For\r\n   particulars about this man _see_ Ḥ.S. ii, 235 and Browne's\r\n   D.S. p. 533.\r\n\r\n   [249] Here in the Ḥai. MS. is one of several blank spaces,\r\n   waiting for information presumably not known to Bābur when\r\n   writing. The space will have been in the archetype of the Ḥai.\r\n   MS. and it makes for the opinion that the Ḥai. MS. is a direct\r\n   copy of Bābur's own. This space is not left in the Elph. MS.\r\n   but that MS. is known from its scribe's note (f. 198) down to\r\n   f. 198 (Ḥai.

This was a betrothal only, the marriage\r\n   being made in 903 AH. _Cf._ Ḥ.S. ii, 260 and Gul-badan's H.N.\r\n   f. 24b.\r\n\r\n   [252] Kehr's MS. supplies Aī (Moon) as her name but it has no\r\n   authority. The Elph. MS. has what may be _lā nām_, no name, on\r\n   its margin and over _tūrūtūnchī_ (4th.) its usual sign of what\r\n   is problematical.\r\n\r\n   [253] _See_ Ḥ.S. ii, 250. Here Pīr-i-Muḥammad _Aīlchī-būghā_\r\n   was drowned. _Cf._ f. 29.\r\n\r\n   [254] Chaghānīān is marked in Erskine's (Mems.) map as\r\n   somewhere about the head of (Fr. map 1904) the Ilyak Water, a\r\n   tributary of the Kāfir-nighān.\r\n\r\n   [255] _i.e._ when Bābur was writing in Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n   [256] For his family _see_ f. 55b note to Yār-`alī _Balāl_.\r\n\r\n   [257] _bā wujūd turklūk muhkam paidā kunanda īdī._\r\n\r\n   [258] Roebuck's _Oriental Proverbs_ (p. 232) explains the\r\n   _five_ of this phrase where _seven_ might be expected, by\r\n   saying that of this Seven days' world (qy. days of Creation)\r\n   one is for birth, another for death, and that thus five only\r\n   are left for man's brief life.\r\n\r\n   [259] The cognomen _Aīlchī-būghā_, taken with the bearer's\r\n   recorded strength of fist, may mean Strong man of Aīlchī (the\r\n   capital of Khutan). One of Tīmūr's commanders bore the name.\r\n   _Cf._ f. 21b for _būghū_ as _athlete_.\r\n\r\n   [260] Hazārāspī seems to be Mīr Pīr Darwesh Hazārāspī. With\r\n   his brother, Mīr `Alī, he had charge of Balkh. _See\r\n   Rauzatu'ṣ-ṣafā_ B.M. Add. 23506, f. 242b; Browne's D.S. p.\r\n   432. It may be right to understand a hand-to-hand fight\r\n   between Hazārāspī and Aīlchī-būghā. The affair was in 857 AH.\r\n   (1453 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [261] _yārāq sīz_, perhaps trusting to fisticuffs, perhaps\r\n   without mail. Bābur's summary has confused the facts. Muḥ.\r\n   Aīlchī-būghā was sent by Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā from Ḥiṣār with\r\n   1,000 men and did not issue out of Qūndūz. (Ḥ.S. ii, 251.) His\r\n   death occurred not before 895 AH.\r\n\r\n   [262] _See_ T.R. _s.nn._ Mīr Ayūb and Ayūb.\r\n\r\n   [263] This passage is made more clear by f. 120b and f. 125b.\r\n\r\n   [264] He is mentioned in _`Alī-sher Nawā'ī's\r\n   Majālis-i-nafā'is_; _see_ B.M. Add. 7875, f. 278 and Rieu's\r\n   Turkish Catalogue.\r\n\r\n   [265] ? full of splits or full handsome.\r\n\r\n   [266] This may have occurred after Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā's death\r\n   whose son Abā-bikr was. _Cf._ f. 28. If so, over-brevity has\r\n   obscured the statement.\r\n\r\n   [267] _mīnglīgh aīldīn dūr_, perhaps of those whose hereditary\r\n   Command was a Thousand, the head of a Mīng (Pers. Hazāra),\r\n   _i.e._ of the tenth of a _tūmān_.\r\n\r\n   [268] _qūrghān-nīng tāshīdā yāngī tām qūpārīb sālā dūr._ I\r\n   understand, that what was taken was a new circumvallation in\r\n   whole or in part. Such double walls are on record. _Cf._\r\n   Appendix A.\r\n\r\n   [269] _bahādurlūq aūlūsh_, an actual portion of food.\r\n\r\n   [270] _i.e._ either unmailed or actually naked.\r\n\r\n   [271] The old English noun _strike_ expresses the purpose of\r\n   the _sar-kob_. It is \"an instrument for scraping off what\r\n   rises above the top\" (Webster, whose example is grain in a\r\n   measure). The _sar-kob_ is an erection of earth or wood, as\r\n   high as the attacked walls, and it enabled besiegers to strike\r\n   off heads appearing above the ramparts.\r\n\r\n   [272] _i.e._ the dislocation due to `Umar Shaikh's death.\r\n\r\n   [273] _Cf._ f. 13. The Ḥ.S. (ii, 274) places his son, Mīr\r\n   Mughūl, in charge, but otherwise agrees with the B.N.\r\n\r\n   [274] _Cf._ Clavijo, Markham p. 132. Sir Charles Grandison\r\n   bent the knee on occasions but illustrated MSS. _e.g._ the\r\n   B.M. _Tawārīkh-i-guzīda Naṣrat-nāma_ show that Bābur would\r\n   kneel down on both knees. _Cf._ f. 123b for the fatigue of the\r\n   genuflection.\r\n\r\n   [275] I have translated _kūrūshūb_ thus because it appears to\r\n   me that here and in other places, stress is laid by Bābur upon\r\n   the mutual gaze as an episode of a ceremonious interview. The\r\n   verb _kūrūshmak_ is often rendered by the Persian translators\r\n   as _daryāftan_ and by the L. and E. Memoirs as _to embrace_. I\r\n   have not found in the B.N. warrant for translating it as _to\r\n   embrace_; _qūchūshmāq_ is Bābur's word for this (f. 103).\r\n   _Daryāftan_, taken as to grasp or see with the mind, to\r\n   understand, well expresses mutual gaze and its sequel of\r\n   mutual understanding. Sometimes of course, _kūrūsh_, the\r\n   interview does not imply _kūrūsh_, the silent looking in the\r\n   eyes with mutual understanding; it simply means _se voyer_\r\n   _e.g._ f. 17. The point is thus dwelt upon because the\r\n   frequent mention of an embrace gives a different impression of\r\n   manners from that made by \"interview\" or words expressing\r\n   mutual gaze.\r\n\r\n   [276] _dābān._ This word Réclus (vi, 171) quoting from\r\n   Fedschenko, explains as a difficult rocky defile; _art_,\r\n   again, as a dangerous gap at a high elevation; _bel_, as an\r\n   easy low pass; and _kūtal_, as a broad opening between low\r\n   hills. The explanation of _kūtal_ does not hold good for\r\n   Bābur's application of the word (f. 81b) to the Sara-tāq.\r\n\r\n   [277] _Cf._ f. 4b and note. From Bābur's special mention of\r\n   it, it would seem not to be the usual road.\r\n\r\n   [278] The spelling of this name is uncertain. Variants are\r\n   many. Concerning the tribe _see_ T.R. p. 165 n.\r\n\r\n   [279] Niẕāmu'd-dīn `Alī _Barlās_: _see_ Gul-badan's H.N.\r\n   _s.n._ He served Bābur till the latter's death.\r\n\r\n   [280] _i.e._ Ẕū'n-nūn or perhaps the garrison.\r\n\r\n   [281] _i.e._ down to Shaibānī's destruction of Chaghatāī rule\r\n   in Tāshkīnt in 1503 AD.\r\n\r\n   [282] Elph. MS. f. 23; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 26 and 217 f. 21;\r\n   Mems. p. 35.\r\n\r\n   Bābur's own affairs form a small part of this year's record;\r\n   the rest is drawn from the Ḥ.S. which in its turn, uses\r\n   Bābur's f. 34 and f. 37b. Each author words the shared\r\n   material in his own style; one adding magniloquence, the other\r\n   retracting to plain statement, indeed summarizing at times to\r\n   obscurity. Each passes his own judgment on events, _e.g._ here\r\n   Khwānd-amīr's is more favourable to Ḥusain Bāī-qarā's conduct\r\n   of the Ḥiṣār campaign than Bābur's. _Cf._ Ḥ.S. ii, 256-60 and\r\n   274.\r\n\r\n   [283] This feint would take him from the Oxus.\r\n\r\n   [284] Tīrmīẕ to Ḥiṣār, 96m. (Réclus vi, 255).\r\n\r\n   [285] Ḥ.S. Wazr-āb valley. The usual route is up the Kām Rūd\r\n   and over the Mūra pass to Sara-tāq. _Cf._ f. 81b.\r\n\r\n   [286] _i.e._ the Ḥiṣārī mentioned a few lines lower and on f.\r\n   99b. Nothing on f. 99b explains his cognomen.\r\n\r\n   [287] The road is difficult. _Cf._ f. 81b.\r\n\r\n   [288] Khwānd-amīr also singles out one man for praise, Sl.\r\n   Maḥmūd _Mīr-i-ākhwur_; the two names probably represent one\r\n   person. The sobriquet may refer to skill with a matchlock, to\r\n   top-spinning (_firnagī-bāz_) or to some lost joke. (Ḥ.S. ii,\r\n   257.)\r\n\r\n   [289] This pregnant phrase has been found difficult. It may\r\n   express that Bābur assigned the sulṯāns places in their due\r\n   precedence; that he seated them in a row; and that they sat\r\n   cross-legged, as men of rank, and were not made, as inferiors,\r\n   to kneel and sit back on their heels. Out of this last\r\n   meaning, I infer comes the one given by dictionaries, \"to sit\r\n   at ease,\" since the cross-legged posture is less irksome than\r\n   the genuflection, not to speak of the ease of mind produced by\r\n   honour received. _Cf._ f. 18b and note on Aḥmad's posture;\r\n   Redhouse _s.nn. bāghīsh_ and _bāghdāsh_; and B.M.\r\n   Tawārīkh-i-guzīda naṣrat-nāma, in the illustrations of which\r\n   the chief personage, only, sits cross-legged.\r\n\r\n   [290] _siyāsat._ My translation is conjectural only.\r\n\r\n   [291] _sar-kob._ The old English noun _strike_, \"an instrument\r\n   for scraping off what appears above the top,\" expresses the\r\n   purpose of the wall-high erections of wood or earth (_L.\r\n   agger_) raised to reach what shewed above ramparts. _Cf._\r\n   Webster.\r\n\r\n   [292] Presumably lower down the Qūndūz Water.\r\n\r\n   [293] _aūz pādshāhī u mīrzālārīdīn artīb._\r\n\r\n   [294] _sic._ Ḥai.

Muḥammad Ṣāliḥ also\r\n   marking the tottering Gate of Sl. `Alī Mīrzā, left him now,\r\n   also for Shaibānī.

(_see supra_), f. 123b foot, the\r\n   information that he was the grandson of Ya`qūb Beg. Zenker\r\n   explains _Sīghalī_ as the name of a Chaghatāī family. An\r\n   _Ayūb-i-Ya`qūb Begchīk Mughūl_ may be an uncle. See f. 43 for\r\n   another grandson.\r\n\r\n   [317] _baẓ'ī kīrkān-kīnt-kīsākkā bāsh-sīz-qīlghān Mughūllārnī\r\n   tūtūb._ I take the word _kīsāk_ in this highly idiomatic\r\n   sentence to be a diminutive of _kīs_, old person, on the\r\n   analogy of _mīr_, _mīrāk_, _mard_, _mardak_. [The Ḥ.S. uses\r\n   _Kīsāk_ (ii, 261) as a proper noun.] The alliteration in _kāf_\r\n   and the mighty adjective here are noticeable.\r\n\r\n   [318] Qāsim feared to go amongst the Mughūls lest he should\r\n   meet retaliatory death. _Cf._ f. 99b.\r\n\r\n   [319] This appears from the context to be Yām (Jām) -bāī and\r\n   not the Djouma (Jām) of the Fr. map of 1904, lying farther\r\n   south. The Avenue named seems likely to be Tīmūr's of f. 45b\r\n   and to be on the direct road for Khujand. _See_ Schuyler i,\r\n   232.\r\n\r\n   [320] _būghān buyīnī._ W.-i-B. 215, _yān_, thigh, and 217\r\n   _gardan_, throat. I am in doubt as to the meaning of _būghān_;\r\n   perhaps the two words stand for joint at the nape of the neck.\r\n   Khwāja-i-kalān was one of seven brothers, six died in Bābur's\r\n   service, he himself served till Bābur's death.\r\n\r\n   [321] _Cf._ f. 48.\r\n\r\n   [322] Khorochkine (Radlov's _Réceuil d'Itinéraires_ p. 241)\r\n   mentions Pul-i-mougak, a great stone bridge thrown across a\r\n   deep ravine, east of Samarkand. _For_ Kūl-i-maghāk, deep pool,\r\n   or pool of the fosse, _see_ f. 48b.\r\n\r\n   [323] From Khwānd-amīr's differing account of this affair, it\r\n   may be surmised that those sending the message were not\r\n   treacherous; but the message itself was deceiving inasmuch as\r\n   it did not lead Bābur to expect opposition. _Cf._ f. 43 and\r\n   note.\r\n\r\n   [324] Of this nick-name several interpretations are allowed by\r\n   the dictionaries.\r\n\r\n   [325] _See_ Schuyler i, 268 for an account of this beautiful\r\n   Highland village.\r\n\r\n   [326] Here Bābur takes up the thread, dropped on f. 36, of the\r\n   affairs of the Khurāsānī mīrzās. He draws on other sources\r\n   than the Ḥ.S.; perhaps on his own memory, perhaps on\r\n   information given by Khurāsānīs with him in Hindūstān _e.g._\r\n   Ḥusain's grandson. _See_ f. 167b. _Cf._ Ḥ.S. ii, 261.\r\n\r\n   [327] _bāghīshlāb tūr._ _Cf._ f. 34 note to _bāghīsh dā_.\r\n\r\n   [328] _Bū sozlār aūnūlūng._ Some W.-i-B. MSS., _Farāmosh\r\n   bakunīd_ for _nakunīd_, thus making the Mīrzā not acute but\r\n   rude, and destroying the point of the story _i.e._ that the\r\n   Mīrzā pretended so to have forgotten as to have an empty mind.\r\n   Khwānd-amīr states that `Alī-sher prevailed at first; his\r\n   tears therefore may have been of joy at the success of his\r\n   pacifying mission.\r\n\r\n   [329] _i.e._ B.Z.'s father, Ḥusain, against Mū`min's father,\r\n   B.Z. and Ḥusain's son, Muz̤affar Ḥusain against B.Z.'s son\r\n   Mū`min;—a veritable conundrum.\r\n\r\n   [330] Garzawān lies west of Balkh. Concerning Pul-i-chirāgh\r\n   Col. Grodekoff's _Ride to Harāt_ (Marvin p. 103 ff.) gives\r\n   pertinent information. It has also a map showing the\r\n   Pul-i-chirāgh meadow. The place stands at the mouth of a\r\n   triply-bridged defile, but the name appears to mean Gate of\r\n   the Lamp (_cf._ Gate of Tīmūr), and not Bridge of the Lamp,\r\n   because the Ḥ.S. and also modern maps write _bīl_ (_bel_),\r\n   pass, where the Turkī text writes _pul_, bridge, narrows,\r\n   pass.\r\n\r\n   The lamp of the name is one at the shrine of a saint, just at\r\n   the mouth of the defile. It was alight when Col. Grodekoff\r\n   passed in 1879 and to it, he says, the name is due now—as it\r\n   presumably was 400 years ago and earlier.\r\n\r\n   [331] Khwānd-amīr heard from the Mīrzā on the spot, when later\r\n   in his service, that he was let down the precipice by help of\r\n   turban-sashes tied together.\r\n\r\n   [332] _yīkīt yīlāng u yāyāq yālīng_; a jingle made by due\r\n   phonetic change of vowels; a play too on _yālāng_, which first\r\n   means stripped _i.e._ robbed and next unmailed, perhaps\r\n   sometimes bare-bodied in fight.\r\n\r\n   [333] _qūsh-khāna._ As the place was outside the walls, it may\r\n   be a good hawking ground and not a falconry.\r\n\r\n   [334] The Ḥ.S. mentions (ii, 222) a Sl. Aḥmad of Chār-shaṃba,\r\n   a town mentioned _e.g._ by Grodekoff p. 123. It also spoils\r\n   Bābur's coincidence by fixing Tuesday, Shab`ān 29th. for the\r\n   battle. Perhaps the commencement of the Muḥammadan day at\r\n   sunset, allows of both statements.\r\n\r\n   [335] Elph. MS. f. 30b; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 34 and 217 f. 26b;\r\n   Mems. p. 46.\r\n\r\n   The abruptness of this opening is due to the interposition of\r\n   Sl. Ḥusain M.'s affairs between Bābur's statement on f. 41\r\n   that he returned from Aūrgūt and this first of 903 AH. that on\r\n   return he encamped in Qulba.\r\n\r\n   [336] _See_ f. 48b.\r\n\r\n   [337] _i.e._ Chūpān-ātā; _see_ f. 45 and note.\r\n\r\n   [338] _Aūghlāqchī_, the Grey Wolfer of f. 22.\r\n\r\n   [339] A sobriquet, the _suppliant_ or perhaps something having\r\n   connection with musk.

The choice here of \"town-rabble\" for retaliatory death\r\n   supports the account of Ḥ.S. ii.\r\n\r\n   [343] \"It was the end of September or beginning of October\"\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [344] _awī u kīpa yīrlār._ _Awī_ is likely to represent\r\n   _kibitkas_.

The\r\n   second appears to give, by abjad, lat. 40° 6\" and long. 99'.\r\n   Mr. Erskine (p. 48) gives lat. 39' 57\" and long. 99' 16\",\r\n   noting that this is according to Ūlūgh Beg's Tables and that\r\n   the long. is calculated from Ferro. The Ency. Br. of 1910-11\r\n   gives lat. 39' 39\" and long. 66' 45\".\r\n\r\n   [347] The enigmatical cognomen, Protected Town, is of early\r\n   date; it is used _i.a._ by Ibn Batūta in the 14th. century.\r\n   Bābur's tense refers it to the past. The town had frequently\r\n   changed hands in historic times before he wrote. The name may\r\n   be due to immunity from damage to the buildings in the town.\r\n   Even Chīngīz Khān's capture (1222 AD.) left the place\r\n   well-preserved and its lands cultivated, but it inflicted\r\n   great loss of men. _Cf._ Schuyler i, 236 and his authorities,\r\n   especially Bretschneider.\r\n\r\n   [348] Here is a good example of Bābur's caution in narrative.\r\n   He does not affirm that Samarkand became Musalmān, or\r\n   (_infra_) that Quṣam ibn `Abbās went, or that Alexander\r\n   founded but in each case uses the presumptive past tense,\r\n   resp. _būlghān dūr_, _bārghān dūr_, _bīnā qīlghān dūr_, thus\r\n   showing that he repeats what may be inferred or presumed and\r\n   not what he himself asserts.\r\n\r\n   [349] _i.e._ of Muḥammad. See Z̤.N. ii, 193.\r\n\r\n   [350] _i.e._ Fat Village. His text misleading him, Mr. Erskine\r\n   makes here the useful irrelevant note that Persians and Arabs\r\n   call the place Samar-qand and Turks, Samar-kand, the former\r\n   using _qaf_ (q), the latter _kaf_ (k). Both the Elph. and the\r\n   Ḥai. MSS. write Samarqand.\r\n\r\n   For use of the name Fat Village, _see_ Clavijo (Markham p.\r\n   170), Simesquinte, and Bretschneider's _Mediæval Geography_\r\n   pp. 61, 64, 66 and 163.\r\n\r\n   [351] _qadam._ Kostenko (i, 344) gives 9 m. as the\r\n   circumference of the old walls and 1-2/3m. as that of the\r\n   citadel. _See_ Mde.

He passed a\r\n   short period, only, of his life in Khartank, a suburb of\r\n   Samarkand.\r\n\r\n   [356] _Cf._ f. 3b and n. 1.\r\n\r\n   [357] This though 2475 ft. above the sea is only some 300 ft.\r\n   above Samarkand. It is the Chūpān-ātā (Father of Shepherds) of\r\n   maps and on it Tīmūr built a shrine to the local patron of\r\n   shepherds. The Zar-afshān, or rather, its Qarā-sū arm, flows\r\n   from the east of the Little Hill and turns round it to flow\r\n   west. Bābur uses the name _Kohik Water_ loosely; _e.g._ for\r\n   the whole Zar-afshān when he speaks (_infra_) of cutting off\r\n   the Dar-i-gham canal but for its southern arm only, the\r\n   Qarā-sū in several places, and once, for the Dar-i-gham canal.\r\n   _See_ f. 49b and Kostenko i. 192.\r\n\r\n   [358] _rūd._ The Zar-afshān has a very rapid current. _See_\r\n   Kostenko i, 196, and for the canal, i, 174. The name\r\n   Dar-i-gham is used also for a musical note having charm to\r\n   witch away grief; and also for a town noted for its wines.\r\n\r\n   [359] What this represents can only be guessed; perhaps 150 to\r\n   200 miles. Abū'l-fidā (Reinaud ii, 213) quotes Ibn Haukal as\r\n   saying that from Bukhārā up to \"Bottam\" (this seems to be\r\n   where the Zar-afshān emerges into the open land) is eight\r\n   days' journey through an unbroken tangle of verdure and\r\n   gardens.\r\n\r\n   [360] _See_ Schuyler i, 286 on the apportionment of water to\r\n   Samarkand and Bukhārā.\r\n\r\n   [361] It is still grown in the Samarkand region, and in Mr.\r\n   Erskine's time a grape of the same name was cultivated in\r\n   Aurangābād of the Deccan.\r\n\r\n   [362] _i.e._ _Shāhrukhī_, Tīmūr's grandson, through Shāhrukh.\r\n   It may be noted here that Bābur never gives Tīmūr any other\r\n   title than Beg and that he styles all Tīmūrids, Mīrzā\r\n   (Mīr-born).\r\n\r\n   [363] Mr. Erskine here points out the contradiction between\r\n   the statements (i) of Ibn Haukal, writing, in 367 AH. (977\r\n   AD.), of Samarkand as having a citadel (_ark_), an outer-fort\r\n   (_qūrghān_) and Gates in both circumvallations; and (2) of\r\n   Sharafu'd-dīn _Yazdī_ (Z̤.N.) who mentions that when, in\r\n   Tīmūr's day, the Getes besieged Samarkand, it had neither\r\n   walls nor gates. _See_ Ouseley's Ibn Haukal p. 253; Z̤.N. Bib.\r\n   Ind. ed. i, 109 and Pétis de la Croix's Z̤.N. (_Histoire de\r\n   Tīmūr Beg_) i, 91.\r\n\r\n   [364] Here still lies the Ascension Stone, the _Gūk-tāsh_, a\r\n   block of greyish white marble. Concerning the date of the\r\n   erection of the building and meaning of its name, _see_ _e.g._\r\n   Pétis de la Croix's _Histoire de Chīngīz Khān_ p. 171; Mems.\r\n   p. 40 note; and Schuyler _s.n._\r\n\r\n   [365] This seems to be the Bībī Khānīm Mosque. The author of\r\n   _Les Mosquées de Samarcande_ states that Tīmūr built Bībī\r\n   Khānīm and the Gūr-i-amīr (Amīr's tomb); decorated\r\n   Shāh-i-zinda and set up the Chūpān-ātā shrine. _Cf._ f. 46 and\r\n   note to Jahāngīr Mīrzā, as to the Gūr-i-amīr.\r\n\r\n   [366] Cap. II. Quoting from Sale's _Qur'ān_ (i, 24) the verse\r\n   is, \"And Ibrāhīm and Ismā`īl raised the foundations of the\r\n   house, saying, 'Lord! accept it from us, for Thou art he who\r\n   hearest and knowest; Lord! make us also resigned to Thee, and\r\n   show us Thy holy ceremonies, and be turned to us, for Thou art\r\n   easy to be reconciled, and merciful.'\"\r\n\r\n   [367] or, _buland_, Garden of the Height or High Garden. The\r\n   Turkī texts have what can be read as _buldī_ but the Z̤.N.\r\n   both when describing it (ii, 194) and elsewhere (_e.g._ ii,\r\n   596) writes _buland_. _Buldī_ may be a clerical error for\r\n   _bulandī_, the height, a name agreeing with the position of\r\n   the garden.\r\n\r\n   [368] In the Heart-expanding Garden, the Spanish Ambassadors\r\n   had their first interview with Tīmūr. _See_ Clavijo (Markham\r\n   p. 130). Also the Z̤.N. ii, 6 for an account of its\r\n   construction.\r\n\r\n   [369] Judging from the location of the gardens and of Bābur's\r\n   camps, this appears to be the Avenue mentioned on f. 39b and\r\n   f. 40.\r\n\r\n   [370] _See_ _infra_ f. 48 and note.\r\n\r\n   [371] The Plane-tree Garden. This seems to be Clavijo's\r\n   _Bayginar_, laid out shortly before he saw it (Markham p.\r\n   136).\r\n\r\n   [372] The citadel of Samarkand stands high; from it the ground\r\n   slopes west and south; on these sides therefore gardens\r\n   outside the walls would lie markedly below the outer-fort\r\n   (_tāsh-qūrghān_). Here as elsewhere the second W.-i-B. reads\r\n   _stone_ for _outer_ (_Cf._ index _s.n._ _tāsh_). For the\r\n   making of the North garden _see_ Z̤.N. i, 799.\r\n\r\n   [373] Tīmūr's eldest son, d. 805 AH. (1402 AD.), before his\r\n   father, therefore. Bābur's wording suggests that in his day,\r\n   the Gūr-i-amīr was known as the Madrāsa. _See_ as to the\r\n   buildings Z̤.N. i, 713 and ii, 492, 595, 597, 705; Clavijo\r\n   (Markham p. 164 and p. 166); and _Les Mosquées de Samarcande_.\r\n\r\n   [374] Hindūstān would make a better climax here than Samarkand\r\n   does.\r\n\r\n   [375] These appear to be pictures or ornamentations of carved\r\n   wood. Redhouse describes _islīmī_ as a special kind of\r\n   ornamentation in curved lines, similar to Chinese methods.\r\n\r\n   [376] _i.e._ the Black Stone (_ka'ba_) at Makkah to which\r\n   Musalmāns turn in prayer.\r\n\r\n   [377] As ancient observatories were themselves the instruments\r\n   of astronomical observation, Bābur's wording is correct.\r\n   Aūlūgh Beg's great quadrant was 180 ft. high; Abū-muḥammad\r\n   _Khujandī's_ sextant had a radius of 58 ft. Jā'ī Singh made\r\n   similar great instruments in Jā'īpūr, Dihlī has others. _Cf._\r\n   Greaves Misc.

(833 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [381] Mr. Erskine notes that this remark would seem to fix the\r\n   date at which Bābur wrote it as 934 AH. (1527 AD.), that being\r\n   the 1584th. year of the era of Vikramāditya, and therefore at\r\n   three years before Bābur's death. (The Vikramāditya era began\r\n   57 BC.)\r\n\r\n   [382] _Cf._ index _s.n._ _tāsh_.\r\n\r\n   [383] This remark may refer to the 34 miles between the town\r\n   and the quarries of its building stone. _See_ f. 49 and note\r\n   to Aītmāk Pass.\r\n\r\n   [384] Steingass, any support for the back in sitting, a low\r\n   wall in front of a house. _See_ Vullers p. 148 and\r\n   _Burhān-i-qāṯi`_; p. 119. Perhaps a _dado_.\r\n\r\n   [385] _beg u begāt, bāgh u bāghcha._\r\n\r\n   [386] Four Gardens, a quadrilateral garden, laid out in four\r\n   plots. The use of the name has now been extended for any\r\n   well-arranged, large garden, especially one belonging to a\r\n   ruler (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [387] As two of the trees mentioned here are large, it may be\r\n   right to translate _nārwān_, not by pomegranate, but as the\r\n   hard-wood elm, Madame Ujfalvy's '_karagatche_' (p. 168 and p.\r\n   222). The name _qarā-yīghāch_ (_karagatch_), dark tree, is\r\n   given to trees other than this elm on account of their deep\r\n   shadow.\r\n\r\n   [388] Now a common plan indeed! _See_ Schuyler i, 173.\r\n\r\n   [389] _juwāz-i-kaghazlār_ (_nīng_) _sū'ī_, _i.e._ the water of\r\n   the paper-(pulping)-mortars. Owing to the omission from some\r\n   MSS. of the word _sū_, water, _juwāz_ has been mistaken for a\r\n   kind of paper. _See_ Mems. p. 52 and _Méms_. i, 102; A.Q.R.\r\n   July 1910, p. 2, art. Paper-mills of Samarkand (H.B.); and\r\n   Madame Ujfalvy p. 188. Kostenko, it is to be noted, does not\r\n   include paper in his list (i, 346) of modern manufactures of\r\n   Samarkand.\r\n\r\n   [390] Mine of mud or clay. My husband has given me support for\r\n   reading _gil_, and not _gul_, rose;—(1) In two good MSS. of\r\n   the W.-i-B. the word is pointed with _kasra_, _i.e._ as for\r\n   _gil_, clay; and (2) when describing a feast held in the\r\n   garden by Tīmūr, the Z̤.N. says the mud-mine became a\r\n   rose-mine, _shuda Kān-i-gil Kān-i-gul_. [Mr. Erskine refers\r\n   here to Pétis de la Croix's _Histoire de Tīmūr Beg_ (_i.e._\r\n   Z̤.N.) i, 96 and ii, 133 and 421.]\r\n\r\n   [391] _qūrūgh._ Vullers, classing the word as Arabic, Zenker,\r\n   classing it as Eastern Turkī, and Erskine (p. 42 n.) explain\r\n   this as land reserved for the summer encampment of princes.\r\n   Shaw (Voc. p. 155), deriving it from _qūrūmāq_, to frighten,\r\n   explains it as a fenced field of growing grain.\r\n\r\n   [392] _Cf._ f. 40. There it is located at one _yīghāch_ and\r\n   here at 3 _kurohs_ from the town.\r\n\r\n   [393] _ṯaur._ _Cf._ Zenker _s.n._ I understand it to lie, as\r\n   Khān Yūrtī did, in a curve of the river.\r\n\r\n   [394] 162 m. by rail.\r\n\r\n   [395] _Cf._ f. 3.\r\n\r\n   [396] _tīrīsīnī sūīūb._ The verb _sūīmāk_, to despoil, seems\r\n   to exclude the common plan of stoning the fruit. _Cf._ f. 3b,\r\n   _dānasīnī alīp_, taking out the stones.\r\n\r\n   [397] _Mīn Samarkandtā aūl (or auwal) aīchkāndā Bukhārā\r\n   chāghīrlār nī aīchār aīdīm._ These words have been understood\r\n   to refer to Bābur's initial drinking of wine but this reading\r\n   is negatived by his statement (f. 189) that he first drank\r\n   wine in Harāt in 912 AH. I understand his meaning to be that\r\n   the wine he drank in Samarkand was Bukhārā wine. The time\r\n   cannot have been earlier than 917 AH. The two words _aūl\r\n   aīchkāndā_, I read as parallel to _aūl_ (_bāghrī qarā_) (f.\r\n   280) 'that drinking,' 'that bird,' _i.e._ of those other\r\n   countries, not of Hindūstān where he wrote.\r\n\r\n   It may be noted that Bābur's word for wine, _chāghīr_, may not\r\n   always represent wine of the grape but may include wine of the\r\n   apple and pear (cider and perry), and other fruits. Cider, its\r\n   name seeming to be a descendant of _chāghīr_, was introduced\r\n   into England by Crusaders, its manufacture having been learned\r\n   from Turks in Palestine.\r\n\r\n   [398] 48 m. 3 fur. by way of the Aītmāk Pass (mod. Takhta\r\n   Qarachi), and, Réclus (vi, 256) Buz-gala-khāna, Goat-house.\r\n\r\n   [399] The name Aītmāk, to build, appears to be due to the\r\n   stone quarries on the range. The pass-head is 34 m. from\r\n   Samarkand and 3000 ft. above it. _See_ Kostenko ii, 115 and\r\n   Schuyler ii, 61 for details of the route.\r\n\r\n   [400] The description of this hall is difficult to translate.\r\n   Clavijo (Markham 124) throws light on the small recesses.\r\n   _Cf._ Z̤.N. i, 781 and 300 and Schuyler ii, 68.\r\n\r\n   [401] The Tāq-i-kisrī, below Bāghdād, is 105 ft. high, 84 ft.\r\n   span and 150 ft. in depth (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [402] _Cf._ f. 46. Bābur does not mention that Tīmūr's father\r\n   was buried at Kesh. Clavijo (Markham p. 123) says it was\r\n   Tīmūr's first intention to be buried near his father, in Kesh.\r\n\r\n   [403] Abū'l-fidā (Reinaud II, ii, 21) says that Nasaf is the\r\n   Arabic and Nakhshab the local name for Qarshī. Ibn Haukal\r\n   (Ouseley p. 260) writes Nakhshab.\r\n\r\n   [404] This word has been translated _burial-place_ and\r\n   _cimetière_ but Qarshī means castle, or royal-residence. The\r\n   Z̤.N. (i, 111) says that Qarshī is an equivalent for Ar.\r\n   _qaṣr_, palace, and was so called, from one built there by\r\n   Qublāī Khān (d. 1294 AD.). Perhaps Bābur's word is connected\r\n   with Gūrkhān, the title of sovereigns in Khutan, and means\r\n   great or royal-house, _i.e._ palace.\r\n\r\n   [405] 94 m. 6-1/2 fur. via Jām (Kostenko i, 115.)\r\n\r\n   [406] See Appendix B.\r\n\r\n   [407] some 34 m. (Kostenko i, 196). Schuyler mentions that he\r\n   heard in Qarā-kūl a tradition that the district, in bye-gone\r\n   days, was fertilized from the Sīr.\r\n\r\n   [408] _Cf._ f. 45.\r\n\r\n   [409] By _abjad_ the words _`Abbās kasht_ yield 853. The date\r\n   of the murder was Ramẓān 9, 853 AH. (Oct. 27th. 1449 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [410] This couplet is quoted in the _Rauẓatu'ṣ-ṣafā_ (lith.\r\n   ed. vi, f. 234 foot) and in the Ḥ.S. ii, 44. It is said, in\r\n   the R.Ṣ. to be by Niẕāmī and to refer to the killing by\r\n   Shīrūya of his father, Khusrau Parwīz in 7 AH. (628 AD.). The\r\n   Ḥ.S. says that `Abdu'l-laṯīf constantly repeated the couplet,\r\n   after he had murdered his father. [See also Daulat Shāh\r\n   (Browne p. 356 and p. 366.) H.B.]\r\n\r\n   [411] By _abjad_, _Bābā Ḥusain kasht_ yields 854. The death\r\n   was on Rabi` I, 26, 854 AH. (May 9th. 1450 AD.). See R.Ṣ. vi,\r\n   235 for an account of this death.\r\n\r\n   [412] This overstates the time; dates shew 1 yr. 1 mth. and a\r\n   few days.\r\n\r\n   [413] _i.e._ The Khān of the Mughūls, Bābur's uncle.\r\n\r\n   [414] Elph. MS. _aūrmaghāīlār_, might not turn; Ḥai. and\r\n   Kehr's MSS. (_sar bā bād_) _bīrmāghāīlār_, might not give.\r\n   Both metaphors seem drawn from the protective habit of man and\r\n   beast of turning the back to a storm-wind.\r\n\r\n   [415] _i.e._ betwixt two waters, the Miyān-i-dū-āb of India.\r\n   Here, it is the most fertile triangle of land in Turkistān\r\n   (Réclus, vi, 199), enclosed by the eastern mountains, the\r\n   Nārīn and the Qarā-sū; Rabāṯik-aūrchīnī, its alternative name,\r\n   means Small Station sub-district. From the uses of _aūrchīn_ I\r\n   infer that it describes a district in which there is no\r\n   considerable head-quarters fort.\r\n\r\n   [416] _i.e._ his own, Qūtlūq-nigār Khānīm and hers,\r\n   Aīsān-daulat Begīm, with perhaps other widows of his father,\r\n   probably Shāh Sulṯān Begīm.\r\n\r\n   [417] _Cf._ f. 16 for almost verbatim statements.\r\n\r\n   [418] Blacksmith's Dale. _Ahangarān_ appears corrupted in\r\n   modern maps to _Angren_. _See_ Ḥ.S. ii, 293 for Khwānd-amīr's\r\n   wording of this episode.\r\n\r\n   [419] _Cf._ f. 1b and Kostenko i, 101.\r\n\r\n   [420] _i.e._ Khān Uncle (Mother's brother).\r\n\r\n   [421] n.w. of the Sang ferry over the Sīr.\r\n\r\n   [422] perhaps, messenger of good tidings.\r\n\r\n   [423] This man's family connections are interesting. He was\r\n   `Alī-shukr Beg _Bahārlū's_ grandson, nephew therefore of Pāshā\r\n   Begīm; through his son, Saif-`alī Beg, he was the grandfather\r\n   of Bairām Khān-i-khānān and thus the g.g.f. of `Abdu'r-raḥīm\r\n   Mīrzā, the translator of the Second _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_. _See_\r\n   Firishta lith. ed. p. 250.\r\n\r\n   [424] Bābur's (step-)grandmother, co-widow with Aīsān-daulat\r\n   of Yūnas Khān and mother of Aḥmad and Maḥmud _Chaghatāī_.\r\n\r\n   [425] Here the narrative picks up the thread of Khusrau Shāh's\r\n   affairs, dropped on f. 44.\r\n\r\n   [426] _mīng tūmān fulūs_, _i.e._ a thousand\r\n   sets-of-ten-thousand small copper coins. Mr. Erskine (Mems. p.\r\n   61) here has a note on coins. As here the _tūmān_ does not\r\n   seem to be a coin but a number, I do not reproduce it,\r\n   valuable as it is _per se_.\r\n\r\n   [427] _ārīqlār_; this the annotator of the Elph. MS. has\r\n   changed to _āshlīq_, provisions, corn.\r\n\r\n   [428] _Samān-chī_ may mean Keeper of the Goods. Tīngrī-bīrdī,\r\n   Theodore, is the purely Turkī form of the Khudāī-bīrdī,\r\n   already met with several times in the B.N.\r\n\r\n   [429] Bast (Bost) is on the left bank of the Halmand.\r\n\r\n   [430] _Cf._ f. 56b.\r\n\r\n   [431] known as _Kābulī_. He was a son of Abū-sa`īd and thus an\r\n   uncle of Bābur. He ruled Kābul and Ghaznī from a date previous\r\n   to his father's death in 873 AH. (perhaps from the time `Umar\r\n   Shaikh was _not_ sent there, in 870 AH. _See_ f. 6b) to his\r\n   death in 907 AH. Bābur was his virtual successor in Kābul, in\r\n   910 AH.\r\n\r\n   [432] Elph. MS. f. 42; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 47b and 217 f. 38;\r\n   Mems. p. 63. Bābur here resumes his own story, interrupted on\r\n   f. 56.\r\n\r\n   [433] _aīsh achīlmādī_, a phrase recurring on f. 59b foot. It\r\n   appears to imply, of trust in Providence, what the English\r\n   \"The way was not opened,\" does. _Cf._ f. 60b for another\r\n   example of trust, there clinching discussion whether to go or\r\n   not to go to Marghīnān.\r\n\r\n   [434] _i.e._ _Aḥrārī_. He had been dead some 10 years. The\r\n   despoilment of his family is mentioned on f. 23b.\r\n\r\n   [435] _fatratlār_, here those due to the deaths of Aḥmad and\r\n   Maḥmūd with their sequel of unstable government in Samarkand.\r\n\r\n   [436] _Aūghlāqchī_, the player of the kid-game, the\r\n   gray-wolfer. Yār-yīlāq will have gone with the rest of\r\n   Samarkand into `Alī's hands in Rajab 903 AH. (March 1498).\r\n   Contingent terms between him and Bābur will have been made;\r\n   Yūsuf may have recognized some show of right under them, for\r\n   allowing Bābur to occupy Yār-yīlāq.\r\n\r\n   [437] _i.e._ after 933 AH. _Cf._ f. 46b and note concerning\r\n   the Bikramāditya era. See index _s.n._ Aḥmad-i-yūsuf and Ḥ.S.\r\n   ii, 293.\r\n\r\n   [438] This plural, unless ironical, cannot be read as\r\n   honouring `Alī; Bābur uses the honorific plural most rarely\r\n   and specially, _e.g._ for saintly persons, for The Khān and\r\n   for elder women-kinsfolk.\r\n\r\n   [439] _bīr yārīm yīl._ Dates shew this to mean six months. It\r\n   appears a parallel expression to Pers. _hasht-yak_,\r\n   one-eighth.\r\n\r\n   [440] Ḥ.S. ii, 293, in place of these two quotations, has a\r\n   _misra`_,—_Na rāy ṣafar kardan u na rūy iqāmat_, (Nor resolve\r\n   to march, nor face to stay).\r\n\r\n   [441] _i.e._ in Samarkand.\r\n\r\n   [442] Point to point, some 145 m. but much further by the\r\n   road. Tang-āb seems likely to be one of the head-waters of\r\n   Khwāja Bikargān-water. Thence the route would be by\r\n   unfrequented hill-tracks, each man leading his second horse.\r\n\r\n   [443] _tūn yārīmī naqāra waqtīdā._ _Tūn yārīmī_ seems to mean\r\n   half-dark, twilight. Here it cannot mean mid-night since this\r\n   would imply a halt of twelve hours and Bābur says no halt was\r\n   made. The drum next following mid-day is the one beaten at\r\n   sunset.\r\n\r\n   [444] The voluntary prayer, offered when the sun has well\r\n   risen, fits the context.\r\n\r\n   [445] I understand that the obeisance was made in the\r\n   Gate-house, between the inner and outer doors.\r\n\r\n   [446] This seeming sobriquet may be due to eloquence or to\r\n   good looks.\r\n\r\n   [447] _qarā tīyāq._ _Cf._ f. 63 where black bludgeons are used\r\n   by a red rabble.\r\n\r\n   [448] He was head-man of his clan and again with Shaibānī in\r\n   909 AH. (Sh. N. Vambéry, p. 272). Erskine (p. 67) notes that\r\n   the Manghīts are the modern Nogais.\r\n\r\n   [449] _i.e._ in order to allow for the here very swift\r\n   current. The Ḥ.S. varying a good deal in details from the B.N.\r\n   gives the useful information that Aūzūn Ḥasan's men knew\r\n   nothing of the coming of the Tāshkīnt Mughūls.\r\n\r\n   [450] _Cf._ f. 4b and App. A. as to the position of Akhsī.\r\n\r\n   [451] _bārīnī qīrdīlār._ After this statement the five\r\n   exceptions are unexpected; Bābur's wording is somewhat\r\n   confused here.\r\n\r\n   [452] _i.e._ in Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n   [453] Taṃbal would be the competitor for the second place.\r\n\r\n   [454] 47 m. 4-1/2 fur.\r\n\r\n   [455] Bābur had been about two lunar years absent from Andijān\r\n   but his loss of rule was of under 16 months.\r\n\r\n   [456] A scribe's note entered here on the margin of the Ḥai.\r\n   MS. is to the effect that certain words are not in the noble\r\n   archetype (_nashka sharīf_); this supports other circumstances\r\n   which make for the opinion that this Codex is a direct copy of\r\n   Bābur's own MS. _See_ Index s.n. Ḥai. MS. and JRAS 1906, p.\r\n   87.\r\n\r\n   [457] _Musalmān_ here seems to indicate mental contrast with\r\n   Pagan practices or neglect of Musalmān observances amongst\r\n   Mughūls.\r\n\r\n   [458] _i.e._ of his advisors and himself.\r\n\r\n   [459] _Cf._ f. 34.\r\n\r\n   [460] _circa_ 933 AH. All the revolts chronicled by Bābur as\r\n   made against himself were under Mughūl leadership. Long Ḥasan,\r\n   Taṃbal and `Alī-dost were all Mughūls. The worst was that of\r\n   914 AH. (1518 AD.) in which Qulī _Chūnāq_ disgraced himself\r\n   (T.R. p. 357).\r\n\r\n   [461] _Chūnāq_ may indicate the loss of one ear.\r\n\r\n   [462] _Būqāq_, amongst other meanings, has that of _one who\r\n   lies in ambush_.\r\n\r\n   [463] This remark has interest because it shews that (as Bābur\r\n   planned to write more than is now with the B.N. MSS.) the\r\n   first gap in the book (914 AH. to 925 AH.) is accidental. His\r\n   own last illness is the probable cause of this gap. _Cf._ JRAS\r\n   1905, p. 744. Two other passages referring to unchronicled\r\n   matters are one about the Bāgh-i-ṣafā (f. 224), and one about\r\n   Sl. `Alī T̤aghāī (f. 242).\r\n\r\n   [464] I surmise Aīlāīsh to be a local name of the Qarā-daryā\r\n   affluent of the Sīr.\r\n\r\n   [465] _aīkī aūch naubat chāpqūlāb bāsh chīqārghalī qūīmās._ I\r\n   cannot feel so sure as Mr. E. and M. de C. were that the man's\r\n   head held fast, especially as for it to fall would make the\r\n   better story.\r\n\r\n   [466] Tūqā appears to have been the son of a T̤aghāī, perhaps\r\n   of Sherīm; his name may imply blood-relationship.\r\n\r\n   [467] For the verb _awīmāq_, to trepan, _see_ f. 67 note 5.\r\n\r\n   [468] The Fr. map of 1904 shews a hill suiting Bābur's\r\n   location of this Hill of Pleasure.\r\n\r\n   [469] A place near Kābul bears the same name; in both the name\r\n   is explained by a legend that there Earth opened a refuge for\r\n   forty menaced daughters.\r\n\r\n   [470] Elph.

Qulī\r\n   _Chūnāq_ (T.R. _s.n._).\r\n\r\n   [476] _awīdī._ The head of Captain Dow, fractured at Chunār by\r\n   a stone flung at it, was trepanned (_Saiyār-i-muta`akhirīn_,\r\n   p. 577 and Irvine l .c. p. 283). Yār-`alī was alive in 910 AH.\r\n   He seems to be the father of the great Bairām Khān-i-khānān of\r\n   Akbar's reign.\r\n\r\n   [477] _chasht-gāh_; midway between sunrise and noon.\r\n\r\n   [478] _ṯaurī_; because providing prisoners for exchange.\r\n\r\n   [479] _shakh tūtūlūr īdī_, perhaps a palisade.\r\n\r\n   [480] _i.e._ from Ḥiṣār where he had placed him in 903 AH.\r\n\r\n   [481] _qūba yūzlūq_ (f. 6b and note 4). The Turkmān features\r\n   would be a maternal inheritance.\r\n\r\n   [482] He is \"Saifī Maulānā `Arūzī\" of Rieu's Pers. Cat. p.\r\n   525. _Cf._ Ḥ.S. ii, 341. His book, _`Arūz-i-saifī_ has been\r\n   translated by Blochmann and by Ranking.\r\n\r\n   [483] _namāz aūtār īdī._ I understand some irony from this (de\r\n   Meynard's Dict. _s.n._ _aūtmāq_).\r\n\r\n   [484] The _maṯla`_ of poems serve as an index of first lines.\r\n\r\n   [485] _Cf._ f. 30.\r\n\r\n   [486] _Cf._ f. 37b.\r\n\r\n   [487] _i.e._ scout and in times of peace, huntsman.

Hamesha * * * dar khāna Shaham Khān * * *_.\r\n\r\n   [488] _pītīldī_; W.-i-B. _navishta shud_, words indicating the\r\n   use by Bābur of a written record.\r\n\r\n   [489] _Cf._ f. 6b and note and f. 17 and note.\r\n\r\n   [490] _tūlūk_; _i.e._ other food than grain. Fruit, fresh or\r\n   preserved, being a principal constituent of food in Central\r\n   Asia, _tūlūk_ will include several, but chiefly melons. \"Les\r\n   melons constituent presque seuls vers le fin d'été, la\r\n   nourriture des classes pauvres\" (Th. Radloff. l.c. p. 343).\r\n\r\n   [491] _Cf._ f. 6b and note.\r\n\r\n   [492] _tūlkī_ var. _tūlkū_, the yellow fox. Following this\r\n   word the Ḥai. MS. has _u dar kamīn dūr_ instead of _u rangīn\r\n   dūr_.\r\n\r\n   [493] _bī ḥadd_; with which I.O. 215 agrees but I.O. 217 adds\r\n   _farbih_, fat, which is right in fact (f. 2b) but less\r\n   pertinent here than an unlimited quantity.\r\n\r\n   [494] Here a pun on _`ajab_ may be read.\r\n\r\n   [495] _Cf._ f. 15, note to T̤aghāī.\r\n\r\n   [496] Apparently not the usual Kīndīr-līk pass but one n.w. of\r\n   Kāsān.\r\n\r\n   [497] A ride of at least 40 miles, followed by one of 20 to\r\n   Kāsān.\r\n\r\n   [498] _Cf._ f. 72 and f. 72b. Tīlba would seem to have left\r\n   Taṃbal.\r\n\r\n   [499] _Taṃbalnīng qarāsī._\r\n\r\n   [500] _i.e._ the Other (Mid-afternoon) Prayer.\r\n\r\n   [501] _ātīnīng būīnīnī qātīb._ _Qātmāq_ has also the\r\n   here-appropriate meaning of _to stiffen_.\r\n\r\n   [502] _aīlīk qūshmāq_, _i.e._ Bābur's men with the Kāsān\r\n   garrison. But the two W.-i-B. write merely _dast burd_ and\r\n   _dast kardan_.\r\n\r\n   [503] The meaning of _Ghazna_ here is uncertain. The Second\r\n   W.-i-B. renders it by ar. _qaryat_ but up to this point Bābur\r\n   has not used _qaryat_ for _village_. Ghazna-namangān cannot be\r\n   modern Namangān. It was 2 m. from Archīān where Taṃbal was,\r\n   and Bābur went to Bīshkhārān to be between Taṃbal and Machamī,\r\n   coming from the south. Archīān and Ghazna-namangān seem both\r\n   to have been n. or n.w. of Bīshkārān (see maps).\r\n\r\n   It may be mentioned that at Archīān, in 909 AH. the two\r\n   Chaghatāī Khāns and Bābur were defeated by Shaibānī.\r\n\r\n   [504] _bīzlār._ The double plural is rare with Bābur; he\r\n   writes _bīz_, we, when action is taken in common; he rarely\r\n   uses _mīn_, I, with autocratic force; his phrasing is largely\r\n   impersonal, _e.g._ with rare exceptions, he writes the\r\n   impersonal passive verb.\r\n\r\n   [505] _bāshlīghlār._ Teufel was of opinion that this word is\r\n   not used as a noun in the B.N. In this he is mistaken; it is\r\n   so used frequently, as here, in apposition. _See_ ZDMG,\r\n   xxxvii, art. Bābur und Abū`l-faẓl.\r\n\r\n   [506] _Cf._ f. 54 foot.\r\n\r\n   [507] _Cf._ f. 20. She may have come from Samarkand and `Alī's\r\n   household or from Kesh and the Tarkhān households.\r\n\r\n   [508] _Cf._ f. 26 l. 2 for the same phrase.\r\n\r\n   [509] He is the author of the _Shaibānī-nāma_.\r\n\r\n   [510] _dāng_ and _fils_ (_infra_) are small copper coins.\r\n\r\n   [511] _Cf._ f. 25 l. 1 and note 1.\r\n\r\n   [512] Probably the poet again; he had left Harāt and was in\r\n   Samarkand (Sh. N. Vambéry, p. 34 l. 14).\r\n\r\n   [513] From what follows, this Mughūl advance seems a sequel to\r\n   a Tarkhān invitation.\r\n\r\n   [514] By omitting the word _Mīr_ the Turkī text has caused\r\n   confusion between this father and son (Index _s.nn._).\r\n\r\n   [515] _bīz khūd kharāb bū mu`āmla aīdūk._ These words have\r\n   been understood earlier, as referring to the abnormal state of\r\n   Bābur's mind described under Sec. _r_. They better suit the\r\n   affairs of Samarkand because Bābur is able to resolve on\r\n   action and also because he here writes _bīz_, we, and not\r\n   _mīn_, I, as in Sec. _r_.\r\n\r\n   [516] For _būlghār_, rendezvous, _see_ also f. 78 l. 2 fr. ft.\r\n\r\n   [517] 25 m. only; the halts were due probably to belated\r\n   arrivals.\r\n\r\n   [518] Some of his ties would be those of old acquaintance in\r\n   Ḥiṣār with `Alī's father's begs, now with him in Samarkand.\r\n\r\n   [519] Point to point, some 90 m. but further by road.\r\n\r\n   [520] _Bū waqi` būlghāch_, manifestly ironical.\r\n\r\n   [521] Sangzār to Aūrā-tīpā, by way of the hills, some 50\r\n   miles.\r\n\r\n   [522] The Sh. N. Vambéry, p. 60, confirms this.\r\n\r\n   [523] _Cf._ f. 74b.\r\n\r\n   [524] Macham and Awīghūr, presumably.\r\n\r\n   [525] _gūzlār tūz tūtī_, _i.e._ he was blinded for some\r\n   treachery to his hosts.\r\n\r\n   [526] Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ's well-informed account of this episode has\r\n   much interest, filling out and, as by Shaibānī's Boswell,\r\n   balancing Bābur's. Bābur is obscure about what country was to\r\n   be given to `Alī. Pāyanda-ḥasan paraphrases his brief\r\n   words;—Shaibānī was to be as a father to `Alī and when he had\r\n   taken `Alī's father's _wilāyāt_, he was to give a country to\r\n   `Alī. It has been thought that the gift to `Alī was to follow\r\n   Shaibānī's recovery of his own ancestral camping-ground\r\n   (_yūrt_) but this is negatived, I think, by the word,\r\n   _wilāyāt_, cultivated land.\r\n\r\n   [527] Elp. MS. f. 57b; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 63b and I.O. 217 f.\r\n   52; Mems. p. 82.\r\n\r\n   Two contemporary works here supplement the B.N.; (1) the\r\n   (_Tawārikh-i-guzīda_) _Naṣrat-nāma_, dated 908 AH. (B.M. Turkī\r\n   Or. 3222) of which Berezin's _Shaibāni-nāma_ is an abridgment;\r\n   (2) Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ Mīrzā's _Shaibānī-nāma_ (Vambéry trs. cap. xix\r\n   _et seq._). The Ḥ.S. (Bomb. ed. p. 302, and Tehran ed. p. 384)\r\n   is also useful.\r\n\r\n   [528] _i.e._ on his right. The Ḥ.S. ii, 302 represents that\r\n   `Alī was well-received. After Shaibāq had had Zuhra's\r\n   overtures, he sent an envoy to `Alī and Yaḥya; the first was\r\n   not won over but the second fell in with his mother's scheme.\r\n   This difference of view explains why `Alī slipped away while\r\n   Yaḥya was engaged in the Friday Mosque. It seems likely that\r\n   mother and son alike expected their Aūzbeg blood to stand them\r\n   in good stead with Shaibāq.\r\n\r\n   [529] He tried vainly to get the town defended. \"Would to God\r\n   Bābur Mīrzā were here!\" he is reported as saying, by Muḥ.\r\n   Ṣāliḥ.\r\n\r\n   [530] Perhaps it is for the play of words on `Alī and `Alī's\r\n   life (_jān_) that this man makes his sole appearance here.\r\n\r\n   [531] _i.e._ rich man or merchant, but _Bī_ (_infra_) is an\r\n   equivalent of Beg.\r\n\r\n   [532] Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ, invoking curses on such a mother, mentions\r\n   that Zuhra was given to a person of her own sort.\r\n\r\n   [533] The Sh. N. and _Naṣrat-nāma_ attempt to lift the blame\r\n   of `Alī's death from Shaibāq; the second saying that he fell\r\n   into the Kohik-water when drunk.\r\n\r\n   [534] Harāt might be his destination but the Ḥ.S. names Makka.\r\n   Some dismissals towards Khurāsān may imply pilgrimage to\r\n   Meshhed.\r\n\r\n   [535] Used also by Bābur's daughter, Gul-badan (l.c. f. 31).\r\n\r\n   [536] Cut off by alien lands and weary travel.\r\n\r\n   [537] The Pers. annotator of the Elph. Codex has changed Alāī\r\n   to _wīlāyat_, and _dābān_ (pass) to _yān_, side. For the\r\n   difficult route _see_ Schuyler, i, 275, Kostenko, i, 129 and\r\n   Rickmers, JRGS. 1907, art. Fan Valley.\r\n\r\n   [538] Amongst Turks and Mughūls, gifts were made by nines.\r\n\r\n   [539] Ḥiṣār was his earlier home.\r\n\r\n   [540] Many of these will have been climbed in order to get\r\n   over places impassable at the river's level.\r\n\r\n   [541] Schuyler quotes a legend of the lake. He and Kostenko\r\n   make it larger.\r\n\r\n   [542] The second occasion was when he crossed from Sūkh for\r\n   Kābul in 910 AH. (fol. 120).\r\n\r\n   [543] This name appears to indicate a Command of 10,000\r\n   (Bretschneider's _Mediæval Researches_, i, 112).\r\n\r\n   [544] It seems likely that the cloth was soiled. _Cf._ f. 25\r\n   and Hughes Dict. of Islām _s.n._ Eating.\r\n\r\n   [545] As, of the quoted speech, one word only, of three, is\r\n   Turkī, others may have been dreamed. Shaikh Maṣlaḥat's tomb is\r\n   in Khujand where Bābur had found refuge in 903 AH.; it had\r\n   been circumambulated by Tīmūr in 790 AH. (1390 AD.) and is\r\n   still honoured.\r\n\r\n   This account of a dream compares well for naturalness with\r\n   that in the seemingly-spurious passage, entered with the Ḥai.\r\n   MS. on f. 118. For examination of the passage _see_ JRAS, Jan.\r\n   1911, and App. D.\r\n\r\n   [546] He was made a Tarkhān by diploma of Shaibānī (Ḥ.S. ii,\r\n   306, l. 2).\r\n\r\n   [547] Here the Ḥai. MS. begins to use the word _Shaibāq_ in\r\n   place of its previously uniform _Shaibānī_. As has been noted\r\n   (f. 5b n. 2), the Elph. MS. writes _Shaibāq_. It may be\r\n   therefore that a scribe has changed the earlier part of the\r\n   Ḥai. MS. and that Bābur wrote _Shaibāq_. From this point my\r\n   text will follow the double authority of the Elph. and Ḥai.\r\n   MSS.\r\n\r\n   [548] In 875 AH. (1470 AD.). Ḥusain was then 32 years old.\r\n   Bābur might have compared his taking of Samarkand with Tīmūr's\r\n   capture of Qarshī, also with 240 followers (Z̤.N. i, 127).\r\n   Firishta (lith. ed. p. 196) ascribes his omission to do so to\r\n   reluctance to rank himself with his great ancestor.\r\n\r\n   [549] This arrival shews that Shaibānī expected to stay in\r\n   Samarkand. He had been occupying Turkistān under The Chaghatāī\r\n   Khān.\r\n\r\n   [550] `Alī-sher died Jan. 3rd. 1501. It is not clear to what\r\n   disturbances Bābur refers. He himself was at ease till after\r\n   April 20th. 1502 and his defeat at Sar-i-pul. Possibly the\r\n   reference is to the quarrels between Binā'ī and `Alī-sher.\r\n   _Cf._ Sām Mīrzā's Anthology, trs. S. de Saçy, _Notices et\r\n   Extraits_ iv, 287 _et seq._\r\n\r\n   [551] I surmise a double play-of-words in this verse. One is\r\n   on two rhyming words, _ghala_ and _mallah_ and is illustrated\r\n   by rendering them as _oat_ and _coat_. The other is on pointed\r\n   and unpointed letters, _i.e._ _ghala_ and _`ala_. We cannot\r\n   find however a Persian word _`ala_, meaning garment.\r\n\r\n   [552] Bābur's refrain is _ghūsīdūr_, his rhymes _būl_,\r\n   _(buyur)ūl_ and _tūl_. Binā'ī makes _būlghūsīdūr_ his refrain\r\n   but his rhymes are not true _viz._ _yīr_, _(sa)mar_ and _lār_.\r\n\r\n   [553] Shawwāl 906 AH. began April 20th. 1501.\r\n\r\n   [554] From the _Bū-stān_, Graf ed. p. 55, l. 246.\r\n\r\n   [555] Sīkīz Yīldūz. _See_ Chardin's _Voyages_, v, 136 and\r\n   Table; also Stanley Lane Poole's _Bābur_, p. 56.\r\n\r\n   [556] In 1791 AD. Muḥ. Effendi shot 482 yards from a Turkish\r\n   bow, before the R. Tox. S.; not a good shot, he declared.\r\n   Longer ones are on record. _See_ Payne-Gallwey's _Cross-bow_\r\n   and AQR. 1911, H. Beveridge's _Oriental Cross-bows_.\r\n\r\n   [557] In the margin of the Elph. Codex, here, stands a Persian\r\n   verse which appears more likely to be Humāyūn's than Bābur's.\r\n   It is as follows:\r\n\r\n     Were the Mughūl race angels, they would be bad;\r\n     Written in gold, the name Mughūl would be bad;\r\n     Pluck not an ear from the Mughūl's corn-land,\r\n     What is sown with Mughūl seed will be bad.\r\n\r\n   This verse is written into the text of the First W.-i-B. (I.O.\r\n   215 f. 72) and is introduced by a scribe's statement that it\r\n   is by _ān Ḥaẓrat_, much as notes known to be Humāyūn's are\r\n   elsewhere attested in the Elph. Codex. It is not in the Ḥai.\r\n   and Kehr's MSS. nor with, at least many, good copies of the\r\n   Second W.-i-B.\r\n\r\n   [558] This subterranean water-course, issuing in a flowing\r\n   well (Erskine) gave its name to a bastion (Ḥ.S. ii, 300).\r\n\r\n   [559] _nāwak_, a diminutive of _nāo_, a tube. It is described,\r\n   in a MS. of Bābur's time, by Muḥ. Budhā'ī, and, in a second of\r\n   later date, by Amīnu'd-dīn (AQR 1911, H.B.'s _Oriental\r\n   Cross-bows_).\r\n\r\n   [560] Kostenko, i, 344, would make the rounds 9 m.\r\n\r\n   [561] _bīr yūz ātliqnīng ātinī nāwak aūqī bila yakhshī atīm._\r\n   This has been read by Erskine as though _būz āt_, pale horse,\r\n   and not _yūz ātlīq_, Centurion, were written. De. C.\r\n   translates by Centurion and a marginal note of the Elph. Codex\r\n   explains _yūz ātlīq_ by _ṣad aspagī_.\r\n\r\n   [562] The Sh. N. gives the reverse side of the picture, the\r\n   plenty enjoyed by the besiegers.\r\n\r\n   [563] He may have been attached to the tomb of Khwāja\r\n   `Abdu'l-lāh _Anṣārī_ in Harāt.\r\n\r\n   [564] The brusque entry here and elsewhere of _e.g._ Taṃbal's\r\n   affairs, allows the inference that Bābur was quoting from\r\n   perhaps a news-writer's, contemporary records. For a different\r\n   view of Taṃbal, the Sh. N. cap. xxxiii should be read.\r\n\r\n   [565] Five-villages, on the main Khujand-Tāshkīnt road.\r\n\r\n   [566] _turk_, as on f. 28 of Khusrau Shāh.\r\n\r\n   [567] Elph. MS. f. 68b; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 78 and 217 f. 61b;\r\n   Mems. p. 97.\r\n\r\n   The Kehr-Ilminsky text shews, in this year, a good example of\r\n   its Persification and of Dr. Ilminsky's dealings with his\r\n   difficult archetype by the help of the Memoirs.\r\n\r\n   [568] _tāshlāb._ The Sh. N. places these desertions as after\r\n   four months of siege.\r\n\r\n   [569] It strikes one as strange to find Long Ḥasan described,\r\n   as here, in terms of his younger brother. The singularity may\r\n   be due to the fact that Ḥusain was with Bābur and may have\r\n   invited Ḥasan. It may be noted here that Ḥusain seems likely\r\n   to be that father-in-law of `Umar Shaikh mentioned on f. 12b\r\n   and 13b.\r\n\r\n   [570] This laudatory comment I find nowhere but in the Ḥai.\r\n   Codex.\r\n\r\n   [571] There is some uncertainty about the names of those who\r\n   left.\r\n\r\n   [572] The Sh. N. is interesting here as giving an eye-witness'\r\n   account of the surrender of the town and of the part played in\r\n   the surrender by Khān-zāda's marriage (cap. xxxix).\r\n\r\n   [573] The first seems likely to be a relation of Niẕāmu'd-dīn\r\n   `Alī Khalīfa; the second was Mole-marked, a foster-sister. The\r\n   party numbered some 100 persons of whom Abū'l-makāram was one\r\n   (Ḥ.S. ii, 310).\r\n\r\n   [574] Bābur's brevity is misleading; his sister was not\r\n   captured but married with her own and her mother's consent\r\n   before attempt to leave the town was made. _Cf._ Gul-badan's\r\n   H.N. f. 3b and Sh. N. Vambéry, p. 145.\r\n\r\n   [575] The route taken avoided the main road for Dīzak; it can\r\n   be traced by the physical features, mentioned by Bābur, on the\r\n   Fr. map of 1904. The Sh. N. says the night was extraordinarily\r\n   dark. Departure in blinding darkness and by unusual ways shews\r\n   distrust of Shaibāq's safe-conduct suggesting that Yaḥyā's\r\n   fate was in the minds of the fugitives.\r\n\r\n   [576] The texts differ as to whether the last two lines are\r\n   prose or verse. All four are in Turkī, but I surmise a\r\n   clerical error in the refrain of the third, where _būlūb_ is\r\n   written for _būldī_.\r\n\r\n   [577] The second was in 908 AH. (f. 18_b_); the third in 914\r\n   AH. (f. 216 _b_); the fourth is not described in the B.N.; it\r\n   followed Bābur's defeat at Ghaj-diwān in 918 AH. (Erskine's\r\n   _History of India_, i, 325). He had a fifth, but of a\r\n   different kind, when he survived poison in 933 AH. (f. 305).\r\n\r\n   [578] Ḥai. MS. _qāqāsrāq_; Elph. MS. _yānasrāq_.\r\n\r\n   [579] _ātūn_, one who instructs in reading, writing and\r\n   embroidery. _Cf._ Gulbadan's H.N. f. 26. The distance walked\r\n   may have been 70 or 80 m.\r\n\r\n   [580] She was the wife of the then Governor of Aūrā-tīpā, Muḥ.\r\n   Ḥusain _Dūghlāt_.\r\n\r\n   [581] It may be noted here that in speaking of these elder\r\n   women Bābur uses the honorific plural, a form of rare\r\n   occurrence except for such women, for saintly persons and\r\n   exceptionally for The supreme Khān. For his father he has\r\n   never used it.\r\n\r\n   [582] This name has several variants. The village lies, in a\r\n   valley-bottom, on the Aq-sū and on a road. _See_ Kostenko, i,\r\n   119.\r\n\r\n   [583] She had been divorced from Shaibānī in order to allow\r\n   him to make legal marriage with her niece, Khān-zāda.\r\n\r\n   [584] Amongst the variants of this name, I select the modern\r\n   one. Macha is the upper valley of the Zar-afshān.\r\n\r\n   [585] Tīmūr took Dihlī in 801 AH. (Dec. 1398), _i.e._ 103\r\n   solar and 106 lunar years earlier. The ancient dame would then\r\n   have been under 5 years old. It is not surprising therefore\r\n   that in repeating her story Bābur should use a tense\r\n   betokening hear-say matter (_bārib īkān dūr_).\r\n\r\n   [586] The anecdote here following, has been analysed in JRAS\r\n   1908, p. 87, in order to show warrant for the opinion that\r\n   parts of the Kehr-Ilminsky text are retranslations from the\r\n   Persian W.-i-B.\r\n\r\n   [587] Amongst those thus leaving seem to have been Qaṃbar-`alī\r\n   (f. 99b).\r\n\r\n   [588] _Cf._ f. 107 foot.\r\n\r\n   [589] The Sh. N. speaks of the cold in that winter (Vambéry,\r\n   p. 160). It was unusual for the Sīr to freeze in this part of\r\n   its course (Sh. N. p. 172) where it is extremely rapid\r\n   (Kostenko, i, 213).\r\n\r\n   [590] _Cf._ f. 4b.\r\n\r\n   [591] Point to point, some 50 miles.\r\n\r\n   [592] _Āhangarān-julgasī_, a name narrowed on maps to Angren\r\n   (valley).\r\n\r\n   [593] _Faut shūd Nuyān._ The numerical value of these words is\r\n   907. Bābur when writing, looks back 26 years to the death of\r\n   this friend.\r\n\r\n   [594] Āb-burdan village is on the Zar-afshān; the pass is\r\n   11,200 ft. above the sea. Bābur's boundaries still hold good\r\n   and the spring still flows. _See_ Ujfalvy _l.c._ i. 14;\r\n   Kostenko, i, 119 and 193; Rickmers, JRGS 1907, p. 358.\r\n\r\n   [595] From the _Bū-stān_ (Graf's ed. Vienna 1858, p. 561). The\r\n   last couplet is also in the _Gulistān_ (Platts' ed. p. 72).\r\n   The Bombay lith. ed. of the _Bū-stān_ explains (p. 39) that\r\n   the \"We\" of the third couplet means Jamshīd and his\r\n   predecessors who have rested by his fountain.\r\n\r\n   [596] _nīma._ The First W.-i-B. (I.O. 215 f. 81 l. 8) writes\r\n   _tawārīkh_, annals.\r\n\r\n   [597] This may be the Khwāja Hijrī of the A.N. (index _s.n._);\r\n   and Badāyūnī's Ḥasan _Hijrī_, Bib. Ind. iii, 385; and Ethé's\r\n   Pers. Cat. No. 793; and Bod. Cat. No. 189.\r\n\r\n   [598] The Ḥai. MS. points in the last line as though punning\r\n   on Khān and Jān, but appears to be wrong.\r\n\r\n   [599] For an account of the waste of crops, the Sh. N. should\r\n   be seen (p. 162 and 180).\r\n\r\n   [600] I think this refers to last year's move (f. 94 foot).\r\n\r\n   [601] In other words, the T. preposition, meaning E. in, at,\r\n   _etc._ may be written with t or d, as _ta(tā)_ or as _da(dā)_.\r\n   Also the one meaning E. towards, may be _gha_, _qa_, or _ka_\r\n   (with long or short vowel).\r\n\r\n   [602] _dīm_, a word found difficult. It may be a derivative of\r\n   root _de_, tell, and a noun with the meaning of English tale\r\n   (number). The First W.-i-B. renders it by _san_, and by _san_,\r\n   Abū'l-ghāzī expresses what Bābur's _dīm_ expresses, the\r\n   numbering of troops. It occurs thrice in the B.N. (here, on f.\r\n   183b and on f. 264b). In the Elphinstone Codex it has been\r\n   written-over into _Ivīm_, once resembles _vīm_ more than _dīm_\r\n   and once is omitted. The L. and E. _Memoirs_ (p. 303) inserts\r\n   what seems a gloss, saying that a whip or bow is used in the\r\n   count, presumably held by the teller to 'keep his place' in\r\n   the march past. The _Siyāsat-nāma_ (Schefer, trs. p. 22) names\r\n   the whip as used in numbering an army.\r\n\r\n   [603] The acclamation of the standards is depicted in B.M.\r\n   W.-i-B. Or. 3714 f. 128b. One cloth is shewn tied to the off\r\n   fore-leg of a live cow, above the knee, Bābur's word being\r\n   _aūrtā aīlīk_ (middle-hand).\r\n\r\n   [604] The libation was of fermented mares'-milk.\r\n\r\n   [605] _lit._ their one way.\r\n\r\n   [606] _Cf._ T.R. p. 308.\r\n\r\n   [607] Elph. MS. f. 74; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 83 and 217 f. 66;\r\n   Mems. p. 104.\r\n\r\n   [608] It may be noted that Bābur calls his mother's brothers,\r\n   not _ṯaghāī_ but _dādā_ father. I have not met with an\r\n   instance of his saying 'My ṯaghāī' as he says 'My dādā.' _Cf._\r\n   index _s.n._ _taghāī_.\r\n\r\n   [609] _kūrūnūsh qīlīb_, reflective from _kūrmak_, to see.\r\n\r\n   [610] A rider's metaphor.\r\n\r\n   [611] As touching the misnomer, 'Mughūl dynasty' for the\r\n   Tīmūrid rulers in Hindūstān, it may be noted that here, as\r\n   Bābur is speaking to a Chaghatāī Mughūl, his 'Turk' is left to\r\n   apply to himself.\r\n\r\n   [612] Gulistān, cap. viii, Maxim 12 (Platts' ed. p. 147).\r\n\r\n   [613] This backward count is to 890 AH. when Aḥmad fled from\r\n   cultivated lands (T.R. p. 113).\r\n\r\n   [614] It becomes clear that Aḥmad had already been asked to\r\n   come to Tāshkīnt.\r\n\r\n   [615] _Cf._ f. 96b for his first departure without help.\r\n\r\n   [616] Yagha (Yaghma) is not on the Fr. map of 1904, but\r\n   suitably located is Turbat (Tomb) to which roads converge.\r\n\r\n   [617] Elph. MS. _tūshkūcha_; Ḥai. MS. _yūkūnchā_. The\r\n   importance Aḥmad attached to ceremony can be inferred by the\r\n   details given (f. 103) of his meeting with Maḥmūd.\r\n\r\n   [618] _kūrūshkāīlār._ _Cf._ Redhouse who gives no support for\r\n   reading the verb _kūrmak_ as meaning _to embrace_.\r\n\r\n   [619] _būrk_, a tall felt cap (Redhouse). In the adjective\r\n   applied to the cap there are several variants. The Ḥai. MS.\r\n   writes _muftūl_, solid or twisted. The Elph. MS. has\r\n   _muftūn-lūq_ which has been understood by Mr. Erskine to mean,\r\n   gold-embroidered.\r\n\r\n   [620] The wording suggests that the decoration is in\r\n   chain-stitch, pricked up and down through the stuff.\r\n\r\n   [621] _tāsh chantāī._ These words have been taken to mean\r\n   whet-stone (_bilgū-tāsh_). I have found no authority for\r\n   reading _tāsh_ as whet-stone. Moreover to allow 'bag of the\r\n   stone' to be read would require _tāsh (nīng) chantāī-sī_ in\r\n   the text.\r\n\r\n   [622] lit. bag-like things. Some will have held spare\r\n   bow-strings and archers' rings, and other articles of\r\n   'repairing kit.' With the gifts, it seems probable that the\r\n   _gosha-gīr_ (f. 107) was given.\r\n\r\n   [623] Vullers, _clava sex foliis_.\r\n\r\n   [624] Zenker, _casse-tête_. _Kīstin_ would seem to be formed\r\n   from the root, _kīs_, cutting, but M. de C. describes it as a\r\n   ball attached by a strap or chain to a handle. _Sanglākh_, a\r\n   sort of mace (_gurz_).\r\n\r\n   [625] The _Rauzatu'ṣ-ṣafā_ states that The Khāns left Tāshkīnt\r\n   on Muḥarram 15th (July 21st. 1502), in order to restore Bābur\r\n   and expel Taṃbal (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [626] lit. saw the count (_dīm_). _Cf._ f. 100 and note\r\n   concerning the count. Using a Persian substitute, the\r\n   Kehr-Ilminsky text writes _san_ (_kūrdīlār_).\r\n\r\n   [627] Elph. MS. _aṃbārchī_, steward, for Itārchī, a\r\n   tribal-name. The 'Mīrzā' and the rank of the army-begs are\r\n   against supposing a steward in command. Here and just above,\r\n   the texts write Mīrzā-i-Itārchī and Mīrzā-i-Dūghlāt, thus\r\n   suggesting that in names not ending with a vowel, the _iẓāfat_\r\n   is required for exact transliteration, _e.g._\r\n   Muḥammad-i-dūghlāt.\r\n\r\n   [628] _Alāī-līq aūrchīnī._ I understand the march to have been\r\n   along the northern slope of the Little Alāī, south of Aūsh.\r\n\r\n   [629] As of Ālmālīgh and Ālmātū (fol. 2b) Bābur reports a\r\n   tradition with caution. The name Aūz-kīnt may be read to mean\r\n   'Own village,' independent, as _Aūz-beg_, Own-beg.\r\n\r\n   [630] He would be one of the hereditary Khwājas of Andijān (f.\r\n   16).\r\n\r\n   [631] For several battle-cries _see_ Th. Radloff's _Réceuils_\r\n   etc. p. 322.\r\n\r\n   [632] _qāshqa ātlīq kīshī._ For a parallel phrase _see_ f.\r\n   92b.\r\n\r\n   [633] Bābur does not explain how the imbroglio was cleared up;\r\n   there must have been a dramatic moment when this happened.\r\n\r\n   [634] _Darwāna_ (a trap-door in a roof) has the variant\r\n   _dur-dāna_, a single pearl; _tūqqāī_ perhaps implies\r\n   relationship; _lūlū_ is a pearl, a wild cow etc.\r\n\r\n   [635] Ḥai. MS. _sāīrt kīshī_. Muḥ. `Alī is likely to be the\r\n   librarian (_cf._ index _s.n._).\r\n\r\n   [636] Elph. MS. _ramāqgha u tūr-gā_; Ḥai. MS. _tārtātgha u\r\n   tūr-gā_. Ilminsky gives no help, varying much here from the\r\n   true text. The archetype of both MSS. must have been difficult\r\n   to read.\r\n\r\n   [637] The Ḥai. MS.'s pointing allows the sobriquet to mean\r\n   'Butterfly.' His family lent itself to nick-names; in it three\r\n   brothers were known respectively as Fat or Lubberly, Fool and,\r\n   perhaps, Butterfly.\r\n\r\n   [638] _bīrk ārīgh_, doubly strong by its trench and its\r\n   current.\r\n\r\n   [639] I understand that time failed to set the standard in its\r\n   usual rest. E. and de C. have understood that the yak-tail\r\n   (_qūtās tūghī_ f. 100) was apart from the staff and that time\r\n   failed to adjust the two parts. The _tūgh_ however is the\r\n   whole standard; moreover if the tail were ever taken off at\r\n   night from the staff, it would hardly be so treated in a mere\r\n   bivouac.\r\n\r\n   [640] _aīshīklīk tūrlūq_, as on f. 113. I understand this to\r\n   mean that the two men were as far from their followers as\r\n   sentries at a Gate are posted outside the Gate.\r\n\r\n   [641] So too 'Piero of Cosimo' and 'Lorenzo of Piero of the\r\n   Medici.' _Cf._ the names of five men on f. 114.\r\n\r\n   [642] _shashtīm._ The _shasht_ (thumb) in archery is the\r\n   thumb-shield used on the left hand, as the _zih-gīr_\r\n   (string-grip), the archer's ring, is on the right-hand thumb.\r\n\r\n   It is useful to remember, when reading accounts of shooting\r\n   with the Turkī (Turkish) bow, that the arrows (_aūq_) had\r\n   notches so gripping the string that they kept in place until\r\n   released with the string.\r\n\r\n   [643] _sar-i-sabz gosha gīr._ The _gosha-gīr_ is an implement\r\n   for remedying the warp of a bow-tip and string-notch. For\r\n   further particulars _see_ Appendix C.\r\n\r\n   The term _sar-i-sabz_, lit. green-head, occurs in the sense of\r\n   'quite young' or 'new,' in the proverb, 'The red tongue loses\r\n   the green head,' quoted in the _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_ account of\r\n   Bābur's death. Applied here, it points to the _gosha-gīr_ as\r\n   part of the recent gift made by Aḥmad to Bābur.\r\n\r\n   [644] _Taṃbal aīkāndūr._ By this tense I understand that Bābur\r\n   was not at first sure of the identity of the pseudo-sentries,\r\n   partly because of their distance, partly, it may be presumed,\r\n   because of concealment of identity by armour.\r\n\r\n   [645] _dūwulgha būrkī_; _i.e._ the soft cap worn under the\r\n   iron helm.\r\n\r\n   [646] Nūyān's sword dealt the blow (f. 97b). Gul-badan also\r\n   tells the story (f. 77) à propos of a similar incident in\r\n   Humāyūn's career. Bābur repeats the story on f. 234.\r\n\r\n   [647] _yāldāghlāmāī dūr aīdīm._ The Second W.-i-B. has taken\r\n   this as from _yāltūrmāq_, to cause to glisten, and adds the\r\n   gloss that the sword was rusty (I.O. 217 f. 70b).\r\n\r\n   [648] The text here seems to say that the three men were on\r\n   foot, but this is negatived by the context.\r\n\r\n   [649] Amongst the various uses of the verb _tūshmak_, to\r\n   descend in any way, the B.N. does not allow of 'falling\r\n   (death) in battle.' When I made the index of the Ḥai. MS.\r\n   facsimile, this was not known to me; I therefore erroneously\r\n   entered the men enumerated here as killed at this time.\r\n\r\n   [650] Elph. MS. _yakhshī_. Zenker explains _bakhshī_\r\n   (pay-master) as meaning also a Court-physician.\r\n\r\n   [651] The Ḥai. Elph. and Kehr's MS. all have _pūchqāq tāqmāq_\r\n   or it may be _pūḥqāq tāqmāq_. T. _būkhāq_ means bandage,\r\n   _pūchāq_, rind of fruit, but the word clear in the three Turkī\r\n   MSS. means, skin of a fox's leg.\r\n\r\n   [652] The _daryā_ here mentioned seems to be the Kāsān-water;\r\n   the route taken from Bīshkhārān to Pāp is shewn on the Fr. map\r\n   to lead past modern Tūpa-qūrghān. Pāp is not marked, but was,\r\n   I think, at the cross-roads east of Touss (Karnān).\r\n\r\n   [653] Presumably Jahāngīr's.\r\n\r\n   [654] Here his father was killed (f. 6b). _Cf._ App. A.\r\n\r\n   [655] `Alī-dost's son (f. 79b).\r\n\r\n   [656] The sobriquet _Khīz_ may mean Leaper, or Impetuous.\r\n\r\n   [657] _kūīlāk_, syn. _kūnglāk_, a shirt not opening at the\r\n   breast. It will have been a short garment since the under-vest\r\n   was visible.\r\n\r\n   [658] _i.e._ when Bābur was writing in Hindūstān. Exactly at\r\n   what date he made this entry is not sure. `Alī was in Koel in\r\n   933 AH. (f. 315) and then taken prisoner, but Bābur does not\r\n   say he was killed,—as he well might say of a marked man, and,\r\n   as the captor was himself taken shortly after, `Alī may have\r\n   been released, and may have been in Koel again. So that the\r\n   statement 'now in Koel' may refer to a time later than his\r\n   capture. The interest of the point is in its relation to the\r\n   date of composition of the _Bābur-nāma_.\r\n\r\n   No record of `Alī's bravery in Aūsh has been preserved. The\r\n   reference here made to it may indicate something attempted in\r\n   908 AH. after Bābur's adventure in Karnān (f. 118b) or in 909\r\n   AH. from Sūkh. _Cf._ Translator's note f. 118b.\r\n\r\n   [659] _aūpchīnlīk._ Vambéry, _gepanzert_; Shaw, four\r\n   horse-shoes and their nails; Steingass, _aūpcha-khāna_, a\r\n   guard-house.\r\n\r\n   [660] Sang is a ferry-station (Kostenko, i, 213). Pāp may well\r\n   have been regretted (f. 109b and f. 112b)! The well-marked\r\n   features of the French map of 1904 allows Bābur's flight to be\r\n   followed.\r\n\r\n   [661] In the Turkī text this saying is in Persian; in the\r\n   Kehr-Ilminsky, in Turkī, as though it had gone over with its\r\n   Persian context of the W.-i-B. from which the K.-I. text here\r\n   is believed to be a translation.\r\n\r\n   [662] _Cf._ f. 96b and Fr. Map for route over the Kīndīr-tau.\r\n\r\n   [663] This account of Muḥ. Bāqir reads like one given later to\r\n   Bābur; he may have had some part in Bābur's rescue (_cf._\r\n   Translator's Note to f. 118b).\r\n\r\n   [664] Perhaps reeds for a raft. Sh. N. p. 258, _Sāl aūchūn bār\r\n   qāmīsh_, reeds are there also for rafts.\r\n\r\n   [665] Here the Turkī text breaks off, as it might through loss\r\n   of pages, causing a blank of narrative extending over some 16\r\n   months. _Cf._ App. D. for a passage, supposedly spurious,\r\n   found with the Ḥaidarābād Codex and the Kehr-Ilminsky text,\r\n   purporting to tell how Bābur was rescued from the risk in\r\n   which the lacuna here leaves him.\r\n\r\n   [666] As in the Farghāna Section, so here, reliance is on the\r\n   Elphinstone and Ḥaidarābād MSS. The Kehr-Ilminsky text still\r\n   appears to be a retranslation from the _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_ and\r\n   verbally departs much from the true text; moreover, in this\r\n   Section it has been helped out, where its archetype was\r\n   illegible or has lost fragmentary passages, from the Leyden\r\n   and Erskine _Memoirs_. It may be mentioned, as between the\r\n   First and the Second _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_, that several obscure\r\n   passages in this Section are more explicit in the First\r\n   (Pāyanda-ḥasan's) than in its successor (`Abdu-r-raḥīm's).\r\n\r\n   [667] Elph. MS. f. 90b; W.-i-B. I.O. 215, f. 96b and 217, f.\r\n   79; Mems. p. 127. \"In 1504 AD. Ferdinand the Catholic drove\r\n   the French out of Naples\" (Erskine). In England, Henry VII was\r\n   pushing forward a commercial treaty, the _Intercursus malus_,\r\n   with the Flemings and growing in wealth by the exactions of\r\n   Empson and Dudley.\r\n\r\n   [668] presumably the pastures of the \"Ilak\" Valley. The route\r\n   from Sūkh would be over the `Alā`u'd-dīn-pass, into the\r\n   Qīzīl-sū valley, down to Āb-i-garm and on to the Aīlāq-valley,\r\n   Khwāja `Imād, the Kāfirnigān, Qabādīān, and Aūbāj on the Amū.\r\n   See T.R. p. 175 and Farghāna Section, p. 184, as to the\r\n   character of the journey.\r\n\r\n   [669] Amongst the Turkī tribes, the time of first applying the\r\n   razor to the face is celebrated by a great entertainment.\r\n   Bābur's miserable circumstances would not admit of this\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   The text is ambiguous here, reading either that Sūkh was left\r\n   or that Aīlāq-yīlāq was reached in Muḥarram. As the birthday\r\n   was on the 8th, the journey very arduous and, for a party\r\n   mostly on foot, slow, it seems safest to suppose that the\r\n   start was made from Sūkh at the end of 909 AH. and not in\r\n   Muḥarram, 910 AH.\r\n\r\n   [670] _chārūq_, rough boots of untanned leather, formed like a\r\n   moccasin with the lower leather drawn up round the foot; they\r\n   are worn by Khīrghīz mountaineers and caravan-men on journeys\r\n   (Shaw).\r\n\r\n   [671] _chāpān_, the ordinary garment of Central Asia (Shaw).\r\n\r\n   [672] The _ālāchūq_, a tent of flexible poles, covered with\r\n   felt, may be the _khargāh_ (kibitka); Persian _chādar_ seems\r\n   to represent Turkī _āq awī_, white house.\r\n\r\n   [673] _i.e._ with Khusrau's power shaken by Aūzbeg attack,\r\n   made in the winter of 909 AH. (_Shaibānī-nāma_ cap. lviii).\r\n\r\n   [674] Cf. ff. 81 and 81b. The armourer's station was low for\r\n   an envoy to Bābur, the superior in birth of the armourer's\r\n   master.\r\n\r\n   [675] var. Chaqānīān and Saghānīān. The name formerly\r\n   described the whole of the Ḥiṣār territory (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [676] the preacher by whom the _Khuṯba_ is read (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [677] _bī bāqī_ or _bī Bāqī_; perhaps a play of words with the\r\n   double meaning expressed in the above translation.\r\n\r\n   [678] Amongst these were widows and children of Bābur's uncle,\r\n   Maḥmūd (f. 27b).\r\n\r\n   [679] _aūghūl._ As being the son of Khusrau's sister, Aḥmad\r\n   was nephew to Bāqī; there may be in the text a scribe's slip\r\n   from one _aūghūl_ to another, and the real statement be that\r\n   Aḥmad was the son of Bāqī's son, Muḥ. Qāsim, which would\r\n   account for his name Aḥmad-i-qāsim.\r\n\r\n   [680] Cf. f. 67.\r\n\r\n   [681] Bābur's loss of rule in Farghāna and Samarkand.\r\n\r\n   [682] about 7 miles south of Aībak, on the road to Sar-i-tāgh\r\n   (mountain-head, Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [683] _viz._ the respective fathers, Maḥmūd and `Umar Shaikh.\r\n   The arrangement was made in 895 AH. (1490 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [684] _Gulistān_ cap. i, story 3. Part of this quotation is\r\n   used again on f. 183.\r\n\r\n   [685] Maḥmūd's sons under whom Bāqī had served.\r\n\r\n   [686] Uncles of all degrees are included as elder brethren,\r\n   cousins of all degrees, as younger ones.\r\n\r\n   [687] Presumably the ferries; perhaps the one on the main road\r\n   from the north-east which crosses the river at Fort Murgh-āb.\r\n\r\n   [688] Nine deaths, perhaps where the Amū is split into nine\r\n   channels at the place where Mīrzā Khān's son Sulaimān later\r\n   met his rebel grandson Shāh-rukh (_T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_, Elliot\r\n   & Dowson, v, 392, and A.N. Bib. Ind., 3rd ed., 441).\r\n   Tūqūz-aūlūm is too far up the river to be Arnold's \"shorn and\r\n   parcelled Oxus\".\r\n\r\n   [689] Shaibāq himself had gone down from Samarkand in 908 AH.\r\n   and in 909 AH. and so permanently located his troops as to\r\n   have sent their families to them. In 909 AH. he drove Khusrau\r\n   into the mountains of Badakhshān, but did not occupy Qūndūz;\r\n   thither Khusrau returned and there stayed till now, when\r\n   Shaibāq again came south (fol. 123). See Sh. N. cap. lviii _et\r\n   seq._\r\n\r\n   [690] From Taṃbal, to put down whom he had quitted his army\r\n   near Balkh (Sh. N. cap. lix).\r\n\r\n   [691] This, one of the many Red-rivers, flows from near\r\n   Kāhmard and joins the Andar-āb water near Dūshī.\r\n\r\n   [692] A _garī_ is twenty-four minutes.\r\n\r\n   [693] Qorān, _Surat_ iii, verse 25; Sale's Qorān, ed. 1825, i,\r\n   56.\r\n\r\n   [694] Cf. f. 82.\r\n\r\n   [695] _viz._ Bāī-sanghar, bowstrung, and Mas`ūd, blinded.\r\n\r\n   [696] Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ is florid over the rubies of Badakhshān he\r\n   says Bābur took from Khusrau, but Ḥaidar says Bābur not only\r\n   had Khusrau's property, treasure, and horses returned to him,\r\n   but refused all gifts Khusrau offered. \"This is one trait out\r\n   of a thousand in the Emperor's character.\" Ḥaidar mentions,\r\n   too, the then lack of necessaries under which Bābur suffered\r\n   (Sh. N., cap. lxiii, and T.R. p. 176).\r\n\r\n   [697] Cf. T. R. p. 134 n. and 374 n.\r\n\r\n   [698] _Jība_, so often used to describe the quilted corselet,\r\n   seems to have here a wider meaning, since the _jība-khāna_\r\n   contained both _joshan_ and _kūhah_, _i.e._ coats-of-mail and\r\n   horse-mail with accoutrements. It can have been only from this\r\n   source that Bābur's men obtained the horse-mail of f. 127.\r\n\r\n   [699] He succeeded his father, Aūlūgh Beg _Kābulī_, in 907\r\n   AH.; his youth led to the usurpation of his authority by\r\n   Sherīm Ẕikr, one of his begs; but the other begs put Sherīm to\r\n   death. During the subsequent confusions Muḥ. Muqīm _Arghūn_,\r\n   in 908 AH., got possession of Kābul and married a sister of\r\n   `Abdu'r-razzāq. Things were in this state when Bābur entered\r\n   the country in 910 AH. (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [700] var. Ūpīān, a few miles north of Chārikār.\r\n\r\n   [701] Suhail (Canopus) is a most conspicuous star in\r\n   Afghānistān; it gives its name to the south, which is never\r\n   called Janūb but Suhail; the rising of Suhail marks one of\r\n   their seasons (Erskine). The honour attaching to this star is\r\n   due to its seeming to rise out of Arabia Felix.\r\n\r\n   [702] The lines are in the Preface to the _Anwār-i-suhailī_\r\n   (Lights of Canopus).\r\n\r\n   [703] \"Die Kirghis-qazzāq drücken die Sonnen-höhe in Pikenaus\"\r\n   (von Schwarz, p. 124).\r\n\r\n   [704] Presumably, dark with shade, as in _qarā-yīghāch_, the\r\n   hard-wood elm (f. 47b and note to _narwān_).\r\n\r\n   [705] _i.e._ Sayyid Muḥammad `Alī, the door-ward. These\r\n   _būlāks_ seem likely to have been groups of 1,000 fighting-men\r\n   (Turki _Mīng_).\r\n\r\n   [706] In-the-water and Water-head.\r\n\r\n   [707] Walī went from his defeat to Khwāst; wrote to Maḥmūd\r\n   _Aūzbeg_ in Qūndūz to ask protection; was fetched to Qūndūz by\r\n   Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ, the author of the _Shaibānī-nāma_, and forwarded\r\n   from Qūndūz to Samarkand (Sh. N. cap. lxiii). Cf. f. 29b.\r\n\r\n   [708] _i.e._ where justice was administered, at this time,\r\n   outside Bābur's tent.\r\n\r\n   [709] They would pass Ajar and make for the main road over the\r\n   Dandān-shikan Pass.\r\n\r\n   [710] The clansmen may have obeyed Aḥmad's orders in thus\r\n   holding up the families.\r\n\r\n   [711] The name may be from Turkī _tāq_, a horse-shoe, but I.O.\r\n   215 f. 102 writes Persian _naqīb_, the servant who announces\r\n   arriving guests.\r\n\r\n   [712] Here, as immediately below, when mentioning the\r\n   Chār-bāgh and the tomb of Qūtlūq-qadam, Bābur uses names\r\n   acquired by the places at a subsequent date. In 910 AH. the\r\n   Taster was alive; the Chār-bāgh was bought by Bābur in 911\r\n   AH., and Qūtlūq-qadam fought at Kānwāha in 933 AH.\r\n\r\n   [713] The Kūcha-bāgh is still a garden about 4 miles from\r\n   Kābul on the north-west and divided from it by a low\r\n   hill-pass. There is still a bridge on the way (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [714] Presumably that on which the Bālā-ḥiṣār stood, the\r\n   glacis of a few lines further.\r\n\r\n   [715] Cf. f. 130.\r\n\r\n   [716] One of Muqīm's wives was a Tīmūrid, Bābur's\r\n   first-cousin, the daughter of Aūlūgh Beg _Kābulī_; another was\r\n   Bībī Zarīf Khātūn, the mother of that Māh-chūchūq, whose anger\r\n   at her marriage to Bābur's faithful Qāsim Kūkūldāsh has filled\r\n   some pages of history (Gulbadan's H.N. _s.n._ Māh-chūchūq and\r\n   Erskine's B. and H. i, 348).\r\n\r\n   [717] Some 9 m. north of Kābul on the road to Āq-sarāī.\r\n\r\n   [718] The Ḥai. MS. (only) writes First Rabī but the Second\r\n   better suits the near approach of winter.\r\n\r\n   [719] Elph. MS. fol. 97; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 102b and 217 f.\r\n   85; Mems. p. 136. Useful books of the early 19th century, many\r\n   of them referring to the _Bābur-nāma_, are Conolly's\r\n   _Travels_, Wood's _Journey_, Elphinstone's _Caubul_, Burnes'\r\n   _Cabool_, Masson's _Narrative_, Lord's and Leech's articles in\r\n   JASB 1838 and in Burnes' _Reports_ (India Office Library),\r\n   Broadfoot's _Report_ in RGS Supp. Papers vol. I.\r\n\r\n   [720] f. 1b where Farghāna is said to be on the limit of\r\n   cultivation.\r\n\r\n   [721] f. 131b. To find these _tūmāns_ here classed with what\r\n   was not part of Kābul suggest a clerical omission of \"beyond\"\r\n   or \"east of\" (Lamghānāt). It may be more correct to write\r\n   Lāmghānāt, since the first syllable may be _lām_, fort. The\r\n   modern form Laghmān is not used in the _Bābur-nāma_, nor, it\r\n   may be added is Paghmān for Pamghān.\r\n\r\n   [722] It will be observed that Bābur limits the name\r\n   Afghānistān to the countries inhabited by Afghān tribesmen;\r\n   they are chiefly those south of the road from Kābul to\r\n   Pashāwar (Erskine). See Vigne, p. 102, for a boundary between\r\n   the Afghāns and Khurāsān.\r\n\r\n   [723] Al-birūnī's _Indika_ writes of both Turk and Hindū-shāhī\r\n   Kings of Kābul. See Raverty's _Notes_ p. 62 and Stein's _Shāhī\r\n   Kings of Kābul_. The mountain is 7592 ft. above the sea, some\r\n   1800 ft. therefore above the town.\r\n\r\n   [724] The Kābul-river enters the Chār-dih plain by the\r\n   Dih-i-yaq`ūb narrows, and leaves it by those of Dūrrīn. Cf.\r\n   _S.A. War_, Plan p. 288 and Plan of action at Chār-āsiyā\r\n   (Four-mills), the second shewing an off-take which may be Wais\r\n   Ātāka's canal. See Vigne, p. 163 and Raverty's _Notes_ pp. 69\r\n   and 689.\r\n\r\n   [725] This, the Bālā-jūī (upper-canal) was a four-mill stream\r\n   and in Masson's time, as now, supplied water to the gardens\r\n   round Bābur's tomb. Masson found in Kābul honoured descendants\r\n   of Wais Ātāka (ii, 240).\r\n\r\n   [726] But for a, perhaps negligible, shortening of its first\r\n   vowel, this form of the name would describe the normal end of\r\n   an irrigation canal, a little pool, but other forms with other\r\n   meanings are open to choice, _e.g._ small hamlet (Pers.\r\n   _kul_), or some compound containing Pers. _gul_, a rose, in\r\n   its plain or metaphorical senses. Jarrett's _Āyīn-i-akbarī_\r\n   writes Gul-kīnah, little rose (?). Masson (ii, 236) mentions a\r\n   similar pleasure-resort, Sanjī-tāq.\r\n\r\n   [727] The original ode, with which the parody agrees in rhyme\r\n   and refrain, is in the _Dīwān, s.l. Dāl_ (Brockhaus ed. 1854,\r\n   i, 62 and lith. ed. p. 96). See Wilberforce Clarke's literal\r\n   translation i, 286 (H. B.). A marginal note to the Ḥaidarābād\r\n   Codex gives what appears to be a variant of one of the rhymes\r\n   of the parody.\r\n\r\n   [728] _aūlūgh kūl_; some 3 m. round in Erskine's time; mapped\r\n   as a swamp in _S.A. War_ p. 288.\r\n\r\n   [729] A marginal note to the Ḥai. Codex explains this name to\r\n   be an abbreviation of Khwāja Shamsū'd-dīn _Jān-bāz_ (or\r\n   _Jahān-bāz_; Masson, ii, 279 and iii, 93).\r\n\r\n   [730] _i.e_. the place made holy by an impress of saintly\r\n   foot-steps.\r\n\r\n   [731] Two eagles or, Two poles, used for punishment. Vigne's\r\n   illustration (p. 161) clearly shows the spur and the detached\r\n   rock. Erskine (p. 137 n.) says that `Uqābain seems to be the\r\n   hill, known in his day as `Āshiqān-i-`ārifān, which connects\r\n   with Bābur Bādshāh. See Raverty's _Notes_ p. 68.\r\n\r\n   [732] During most of the year this wind rushes through the\r\n   Hindū-kush (Parwān)-pass; it checks the migration of the birds\r\n   (f. 142), and it may be the cause of the deposit of the\r\n   Running-sands (Burnes, p. 158). Cf. Wood, p. 124.\r\n\r\n   [733] He was Badī`u'z-zamān's _Ṣadr_ before serving Bābur; he\r\n   died in 918 AH. (1512 AD.), in the battle of Kūl-i-malik where\r\n   `Ubaidu'l-lāh _Aūzbeg_ defeated Bābur. He may be identical\r\n   with Mīr Ḥusain the Riddler of f. 181, but seems not to be\r\n   Mullā Muḥ. _Badakhshī_, also a Riddler, because the\r\n   _Ḥabību's-siyār_ (ii, 343 and 344) gives this man a separate\r\n   notice. Those interested in enigmas can find one made by\r\n   T̤ālib on the name Yaḥya (Ḥ.S. ii, 344). Sharafu'd-dīn `Alī\r\n   _Yazdī_, the author of the _Z̤afar-nāma_, wrote a book about a\r\n   novel kind of these puzzles (T.R. p. 84).\r\n\r\n   [734] The original couplet is as follows:—\r\n\r\n     _Bakhūr dar arg-i Kābul mai, bagardān kāsa pāy dar pāy,\r\n     Kah ham koh ast, u ham daryā, u ham shahr ast, u ham ṣaḥrā'._\r\n\r\n   What T̤ālib's words may be inferred to conceal is the opinion\r\n   that like Badī`u'z-zamān and like the meaning of his name,\r\n   Kābul is the Wonder-of-the-world. (Cf. M. Garçin de Tassy's\r\n   _Rhétorique_ [p. 165], for _ces combinaisons énigmatiques_.)\r\n\r\n   [735] All MSS. do not mention Kāshghar.\r\n\r\n   [736] Khīta (Cathay) is Northern China; Chīn (_infra_) is\r\n   China; Rūm is Turkey and particularly the provinces near\r\n   Trebizond (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [737] 300% to 400% (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [738] Persian _sinjid_, Brandis, _elæagnus hortensis_; Erskine\r\n   (Mems. p. 138) jujube, presumably the _zizyphus jujuba_ of\r\n   Speede, Supplement p. 86. Turkī _yāngāq_, walnut, has several\r\n   variants, of which the most marked is _yānghkāq_. For a good\r\n   account of Kābul fruits _see_ Masson, ii, 230.\r\n\r\n   [739] a kind of plum (?). It seems unlikely to be a cherry\r\n   since Bābur does not mention cherries as good in his old\r\n   dominions, and Firminger (p. 244) makes against it as\r\n   introduced from India. Steingass explains _alū-bālū_ by\r\n   \"sour-cherry, an armarylla\"; if sour, is it the Morello\r\n   cherry?\r\n\r\n   [740] The sugar-cane was seen in abundance in Lan-po (Lamghān)\r\n   by a Chinese pilgrim (Beale, p. 90); Bābur's introduction of\r\n   it may have been into his own garden only in Nīngnahār (f.\r\n   132b).\r\n\r\n   [741] _i.e._ the seeds of _pinus Gerardiana_.\r\n\r\n   [742] _rawāshlār._ The green leaf-stalks (_chūkrī_) of _ribes\r\n   rheum_ are taken into Kābul in mid-April from the\r\n   Pamghān-hills; a week later they are followed by the blanched\r\n   and tended _rawāsh_ (Masson, ii, 7). _See_ Gul-badan's H.N.\r\n   trs. p. 188, Vigne, p. 100 and 107, Masson, ii, 230, Conolly,\r\n   i, 213.\r\n\r\n   [743] a large green fruit, shaped something like a citron;\r\n   also a large sort of cucumber (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [744] The _ṣāḥibī_, a grape praised by Bābur amongst\r\n   Samarkandī fruits, grows in Koh-dāman; another well-known\r\n   grape of Kābul is the long stoneless _ḥusainī_, brought by\r\n   Afghān traders into Hindūstān in round, flat boxes of poplar\r\n   wood (Vigne, p. 172).\r\n\r\n   [745] An allusion, presumably, to the renouncement of wine\r\n   made by Bābur and some of his followers in 933 AH. (1527 AD.\r\n   f. 312). He may have had `Umar _Khayyām's_ quatrain in mind,\r\n   \"Wine's power is known to wine-bibbers alone\" (Whinfield's 2nd\r\n   ed. 1901, No. 164).\r\n\r\n   [746] _pūstīn_, usually of sheep-skin. For the wide range of\r\n   temperature at Kābul in 24 hours, _see_ Ency. Brtt. art.\r\n   Afghānistān. The winters also vary much in severity (Burnes,\r\n   p. 273).\r\n\r\n   [747] Index _s.n._ As he fought at Kānwāha, he will have been\r\n   buried after March 1527 AD.; this entry therefore will have\r\n   been made later. The Curriers'-gate is the later Lahor-gate\r\n   (Masson, ii, 259).\r\n\r\n   [748] Index _s.n._\r\n\r\n   [749] For lists of the Hindū-kush passes _see_ Leech's Report\r\n   VII; Yule's _Introductory Essay_ to Wood's _Journey_ 2nd ed.;\r\n   PRGS 1879, Markham's art. p. 121.\r\n\r\n   The highest _cols_ on the passes here enumerated by Bābur\r\n   are,—Khawāk 11,640 ft.—T̤ūl, height not known,—Pārandī 15,984\r\n   ft.—Bāj-gāh (Toll-place) 12,000 ft.—Walīān (Saints) 15,100\r\n   ft.—Chahār-dār (Four-doors) 18,900 ft. and Shibr-tū 9800 ft.\r\n   In considering the labour of their ascent and descent, the\r\n   general high level, north and south of them, should be borne\r\n   in mind; _e.g._ Chārikār (Chār-yak-kār) stands 5200 ft. and\r\n   Kābul itself at 5780 ft. above the sea.\r\n\r\n   [750] _i.e._ the hollow, long, and small-bāzār roads\r\n   respectively. Panjhīr is explained by Hindūs to be Panj-sher,\r\n   the five lion-sons of Pandu (Masson, iii, 168).\r\n\r\n   [751] Shibr is a Hazāra district between the head of the\r\n   Ghūr-bund valley and Bāmīān. It does not seem to be correct to\r\n   omit the _tū_ from the name of the pass. Persian _tū_, turn,\r\n   twist (syn. _pīch_) occurs in other names of local passes; to\r\n   read it here as a _turn_ agrees with what is said of Shibr-tū\r\n   pass as not crossing but turning the Hindū-kush (Cunningham).\r\n   Lord uses the same wording about the Ḥājī-ghāt (var. -kāk\r\n   etc.) traverse of the same spur, which \"turns the extremity of\r\n   the Hindū-kush\". _See_ Cunningham's _Ancient Geography_, i,\r\n   25; Lord's _Ghūr-bund_ (JASB 1838 p. 528), Masson, iii, 169\r\n   and Leech's _Report_ VII.\r\n\r\n   [752] Perhaps through Jālmīsh into Saighān.\r\n\r\n   [753] _i.e._ they are closed.\r\n\r\n   [754] It was unknown in Mr. Erskine's day (Mems. p. 140).\r\n   Several of the routes in Raverty's _Notes_ (p. 92 etc.) allow\r\n   it to be located as on the Īrī-āb, near to or identical with\r\n   Bāghzān, 35 _kurohs_ (70 m.) s.s.e. of Kābul.\r\n\r\n   [755] Farmūl, about the situation of which Mr. Erskine was in\r\n   doubt, is now marked in maps, Ūrghūn being its principal\r\n   village.\r\n\r\n   [756] 15 miles below Atak (Erskine). Mr. Erskine notes that he\r\n   found no warrant, previous to Abū'l-faẓl's, for calling the\r\n   Indus the Nīl-āb, and that to find one would solve an ancient\r\n   geographical difficulty. This difficulty, my husband suggests,\r\n   was Alexander's supposition that the Indus was the Nile. In\r\n   books grouping round the _Bābur-nāma_, the name Nīl-āb is not\r\n   applied to the Indus, but to the ferry-station on that river,\r\n   said to owe its name to a spring of azure water on its eastern\r\n   side. (Cf. Afẓal Khān _Khattak_, R.'s _Notes_ p. 447.)\r\n\r\n   I find the name Nīl-āb applied to the Kābul-river:—1. to its\r\n   Arghandī affluent (Cunningham, p. 17, Map); 2. through its\r\n   boatman class, the Nīl-ābīs of Lālpūra, Jalālābād and Kūnār\r\n   (G. of I. 1907, art. Kābul); 3. inferentially to it as a\r\n   tributary of the Indus (D'Herbélot); 4. to it near its\r\n   confluence with the grey, silt-laden Indus, as blue by\r\n   contrast (Sayyid Ghulām-i-muḥammad, R.'s _Notes_ p. 34). (For\r\n   Nīl-āb (Naulibis?) in Ghūr-bund _see_ Cunningham, p. 32 and\r\n   Masson, iii, 169.)\r\n\r\n   [757] By one of two routes perhaps,—either by the\r\n   Khaibar-Nīngnahār-Jagdālīk road, or along the north bank of\r\n   the Kābul-river, through Goshṭa to the crossing where, in\r\n   1879, the 10th Hussars met with disaster. _See_ _S.A. War_,\r\n   Map 2 and p. 63; Leech's _Reports_ II and IV (Fords of the\r\n   Indus); and R.'s _Notes_ p. 44.\r\n\r\n   [758] Hāru, Leech's Harroon, apparently, 10 m. above Atak. The\r\n   text might be read to mean that both rivers were forded near\r\n   their confluence, but, finding no warrant for supposing the\r\n   Kābul-river fordable below Jalālābād, I have guided the\r\n   translation accordingly; this may be wrong and may conceal a\r\n   change in the river.\r\n\r\n   [759] Known also as Dhān-kot and as Mu`az̤z̤am-nagar\r\n   (_Ma`āṣiru'l-`umrā_ i, 249 and A.N. trs. H.B. index _s.n._\r\n   Dhān-kot). It was on the east bank of the Indus, probably near\r\n   modern Kālā-bāgh, and was washed away not before 956 AH. (1549\r\n   AD. H. Beveridge).\r\n\r\n   [760] Chaupāra seems, from f. 148b, to be the Chapari of\r\n   Survey Map 1889. Bābur's _Dasht_ is modern Dāman.\r\n\r\n   [761] _aīmāq_, used usually of Mughūls, I think. It may be\r\n   noted that Lieutenant Leech compiled a vocabulary of the\r\n   tongue of the Mughūl Aīmāq in Qandahār and Harāt (JASB 1838,\r\n   p. 785).\r\n\r\n   [762] The _Āyīn-i-akbarī_ account of Kābul both uses and\r\n   supplements the _Bābur-nāma_.\r\n\r\n   [763] _viz._ `Alī-shang, Alangār and Mandrāwar (the Lamghānāt\r\n   proper), Nīngnahār (with its _bulūk_, Kāma),\r\n   Kūnār-with-Nūr-gal, (and the two _bulūks_ of Nūr-valley and\r\n   Chaghān-sarāī).\r\n\r\n   [764] _See_ Appendix E, _On Nagarahāra_.\r\n\r\n   [765] The name Adīnapūr is held to be descended from ancient\r\n   Udyānapūra (Garden-town); its ancestral form however was\r\n   applied to Nagarahāra, apparently, in the Bārān-Sūrkh-rūd\r\n   _dū-āb_, and not to Bābur's _dārogha's_ seat. The Sūrkh-rūd's\r\n   deltaic mouth was a land of gardens; when Masson visited\r\n   Adīnapūr he went from Bālā-bāgh (High-garden); this appears to\r\n   stand where Bābur locates his Bāgh-i-wafā, but he was shown a\r\n   garden he took to be this one of Bābur's, a mile higher up the\r\n   Sūrkh-rūd. A later ruler made the Chār-bāgh of maps. It may be\r\n   mentioned that Bālā-bāgh has become in some maps Rozābād\r\n   (Garden-town). _See_ Masson, i, 182 and iii, 186; R.'s\r\n   _Notes_; and Wilson's _Ariana Antiqua_, Masson's art.\r\n\r\n   [766] One of these _tangī_ is now a literary asset in Mr.\r\n   Kipling's _My Lord the Elephant_. Bābur's 13 y. represent some\r\n   82 miles; on f. 137b the Kābul-Ghaznī road of 14 y. represents\r\n   some 85; in each case the _yīghāch_ works out at over six\r\n   miles (Index _s.n._ _yīghāch_ and Vigne, p. 454). Sayyid\r\n   Ghulām-i-muḥammad traces this route minutely (R.'s _Notes_ pp.\r\n   57, 59).\r\n\r\n   [767] Masson was shewn \"Chaghatai castles\", attributed to\r\n   Bābur (iii, 174).\r\n\r\n   [768] Dark-turn, perhaps, as in Shibr-tū, Jāl-tū, _etc._ (f.\r\n   130b and note to Shibr-tū).\r\n\r\n   [769] f. 145 where the change is described in identical words,\r\n   as seen south of the Jagdālīk-pass. The Bādām-chashma pass\r\n   appears to be a traverse of the eastern rampart of the\r\n   Tīzīn-valley.\r\n\r\n   [770] Appendix E, _On Nagarahāra_.\r\n\r\n   [771] No record exists of the actual laying-out of the garden;\r\n   the work may have been put in hand during the Mahmand\r\n   expedition of 914 AH. (f. 216); the name given to it suggests\r\n   a gathering there of loyalists when the stress was over of the\r\n   bad Mughūl rebellion of that year (f. 216b where the narrative\r\n   breaks off abruptly in 914 AH. and is followed by a gap down\r\n   to 925 AH.-1519 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [772] No annals of 930 AH. are known to exist; from Ṣafar 926\r\n   AH. to 932 AH. (Jan. 1520-Nov. 1525 AD.) there is a lacuna.\r\n   Accounts of the expedition are given by Khāfī Khān, i, 47 and\r\n   Firishta, lith. ed. p. 202.\r\n\r\n   [773] Presumably to his son, Humāyūn, then governor in\r\n   Badakhshān; Bukhārā also was under Bābur's rule.\r\n\r\n   [774] Here, _qārī_, yards. The dimensions 10 by 10, are those\r\n   enjoined for places of ablution.\r\n\r\n   [775] Presumably those of the _tūqūz-rūd_, _supra_. Cf.\r\n   Appendix E, _On Nagarahāra_.\r\n\r\n   [776] White-mountain; Pushtū, Spīn-ghur (or ghar).\r\n\r\n   [777] _i.e._ the Lamghānāt proper. The range is variously\r\n   named; in (Persian) Siyāh-koh (Black-mountain), which like\r\n   Turkī Qarā-tāgh may mean non-snowy; by Tājīks, Bāgh-i-ātāka\r\n   (Foster-father's garden); by Afghāns, Kanda-ghur, and by\r\n   Lamghānīs Koh-i-būlān,—Kanda and Būlān both being\r\n   ferry-stations below it (Masson, iii, 189; also the Times Nov.\r\n   20th 1912 for a cognate illustration of diverse naming).\r\n\r\n   [778] A comment made here by Mr. Erskine on changes of name is\r\n   still appropriate, but some seeming changes may well be due to\r\n   varied selection of land-marks. Of the three routes next\r\n   described in the text, one crosses as for Mandrāwar; the\r\n   second, as for `Alī-shang, a little below the outfall of the\r\n   Tīzīn-water; the third may take off from the route, between\r\n   Kābul and Tag-aū, marked in Col. Tanner's map (PRGS 1881 p.\r\n   180). Cf. R's Route 11; and for Aūlūgh-nūr, Appendix F, _On\r\n   the name Nūr_.\r\n\r\n   [779] The name of this pass has several variants. Its second\r\n   component, whatever its form, is usually taken to mean _pass_,\r\n   but to read it here as pass would be redundant, since Bābur\r\n   writes \"pass (_kūtal_) of Bād-i-pīch\". Pich occurs as a place\r\n   name both east (Pīch) and west (Pīchghān) of the _kūtal_, but\r\n   what would suit the bitter and even fatal winds of the pass\r\n   would be to read the name as Whirling-wind (_bād-i-pīch_).\r\n   Another explanation suggests itself from finding a\r\n   considerable number of pass-names such as Shibr-tū, Jāi-tū,\r\n   Qarā-tū, in which _tū_ is a synonym of _pīch_, turn, twist;\r\n   thus Bād-i-pīch may be the local form of Bād-tū, Windy-turn.\r\n\r\n   [780] _See_ Masson, iii, 197 and 289. Both in Pashāī and\r\n   Lamghānī, _lām_ means fort.\r\n\r\n   [781] _See_ Appendix F, _On the name Dara-i-nūr_.\r\n\r\n   [782] _ghair mukarrar._ Bābur may allude to the remarkable\r\n   change men have wrought in the valley-bottom (Appendix F, for\r\n   Col. Tanner's account of the valley).\r\n\r\n   [783] f. 154.\r\n\r\n   [784] _diospyrus lotus_, the European date-plum, supposed to\r\n   be one of the fruits eaten by the Lotophagi. It is purple, has\r\n   bloom and is of the size of a pigeon's egg or a cherry. See\r\n   Watts' _Economic Products of India_; Brandis' _Forest Trees_,\r\n   Illustrations; and Speede's _Indian Hand-book_.\r\n\r\n   [785] As in Lombardy, perhaps; in Luhūgur vines are clipped\r\n   into standards; in most other places in Afghānistān they are\r\n   planted in deep trenches and allowed to run over the\r\n   intervening ridges or over wooden framework. In the narrow\r\n   Khūlm-valley they are trained up poplars so as to secure them\r\n   the maximum of sun. _See_ Wood's _Report_ VI p. 27; Bellew's\r\n   _Afghānistān_ p. I75 and _Mems_. p. 142 note.\r\n\r\n   [786] Appendix G, _On the names of two Nūrī wines_.\r\n\r\n   [787] This practice Bābur viewed with disgust, the hog being\r\n   an impure animal according to Muḥammadan Law (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [788] The _Khazīnatu'l-asfiyā_ (ii, 293) explains how it came\r\n   about that this saint, one honoured in Kashmīr, was buried in\r\n   Khutlān. He died in Hazāra (Paklī) and there the Paklī Sulṯān\r\n   wished to have him buried, but his disciples, for some\r\n   unspecified reason, wished to bury him in Khutlān. In order to\r\n   decide the matter they invited the Sultān to remove the bier\r\n   with the corpse upon it. It could not be stirred from its\r\n   place. When, however, a single one of the disciples tried to\r\n   move it, he alone was able to lift it, and to bear it away on\r\n   his head. Hence the burial in Khutlān. The death occurred in\r\n   786 AH. (1384 AD.). A point of interest in this legend is\r\n   that, like the one to follow, concerning dead women, it shews\r\n   belief in the living activities of the dead.\r\n\r\n   [789] The MSS. vary between 920 and 925 AH.—neither date seems\r\n   correct. As the annals of 925 AH. begin in Muḥarram, with\r\n   Bābur to the east of Bājaur, we surmise that the Chaghān-sarāī\r\n   affair may have occurred on his way thither, and at the end of\r\n   924 AH.\r\n\r\n   [790] _karanj_, _coriandrum sativum_.\r\n\r\n   [791] Some 20-24 m. north of Jalālābād. The name Multa-kundī\r\n   may refer to the Rām-kundī range, or mean Lower district, or\r\n   mean Below Kundī. _See_ Biddulph's _Khowārī Dialect s.n_\r\n   under; R.'s _Notes_ p. 108 and _Dict. s.n. kund_; Masson, i,\r\n   209.\r\n\r\n   [792] _i.e._ treat her corpse as that of an infidel (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [793] It would suit the position of this village if its name\r\n   were found to link to the Turkī verb _chaqmāq_, to go out,\r\n   because it lies in the mouth of a defile (Dahānah-i-koh,\r\n   Mountain-mouth) through which the road for Kāfiristān goes out\r\n   past the village. A not-infrequent explanation of the name to\r\n   mean White-house, Āq-sarāī, may well be questioned. _Chaghān_,\r\n   white, is Mughūlī and it would be less probable for a Mughūlī\r\n   than for a Turkī name to establish itself. Another explanation\r\n   may lie in the tribe name Chugānī. The two forms _chaghān_ and\r\n   _chaghār_ may well be due to the common local interchange in\r\n   speech of _n_ with _r_. (For Dahānah-i-koh _see_ [some] maps\r\n   and Raverty's Bājaur routes.)\r\n\r\n   [794] Nīmchas, presumably,—half-bred in custom, perhaps in\r\n   blood—; and not improbably, converted Kāfirs. It is useful to\r\n   remember that Kāfiristān was once bounded, west and south, by\r\n   the Bārān-water.\r\n\r\n   [795] Kāfir wine is mostly poor, thin and, even so, usually\r\n   diluted with water. When kept two or three years, however, it\r\n   becomes clear and sometimes strong. Sir G. S. Robertson never\r\n   saw a Kāfir drunk (_Kāfirs of the Hindū-kush_, p. 591).\r\n\r\n   [796] Kāma might have classed better under Nīngnahār of which\r\n   it was a dependency.\r\n\r\n   [797] _i.e._ water-of-Nijr; so too, Badr-aū and Tag-aū.\r\n   Nijr-aū has seven-valleys (JASB 1838 p. 329 and Burnes'\r\n   _Report X_). Sayyid Ghulām-i-muḥammad mentions that Bābur\r\n   established a frontier-post between Nijr-aū and Kāfiristān\r\n   which in his own day was still maintained. He was an envoy of\r\n   Warren Hastings to Tīmūr Shāh _Sadozī_ (R.'s _Notes_ p. 36 and\r\n   p. 142).\r\n\r\n   [798] _Kāfirwash_; they were Kafirs converted to\r\n   Muḥammadanism.\r\n\r\n   [799] _Archa_, if not inclusive, meaning conifer, may\r\n   represent _juniperus excelsa_, this being the common local\r\n   conifer. The other trees of the list are _pinus Gerardiana_\r\n   (Brandis, p. 690), _quercus bīlūt_, the holm-oak, and\r\n   _pistacia mutica_ or _khanjak_, a tree yielding mastic.\r\n\r\n   [800] _rūba-i-parwān_, _pteromys inornatus_, the large, red\r\n   flying-squirrel (Blandford's _Fauna of British India_,\r\n   _Mammalia_, p. 363).\r\n\r\n   [801] The _giz_ is a short-flight arrow used for shooting\r\n   small birds _etc._ Descending flights of squirrels have been\r\n   ascertained as 60 yards, one, a record, of 80 (Blandford).\r\n\r\n   [802] Apparently _tetrogallus himalayensis_, the Himalayan\r\n   snow-cock (Blandford, iv, 143).Burnes (_Cabool_ p. 163)\r\n   describes the _kabg-i-darī_ as the _rara avis_ of the Kābul\r\n   Kohistān, somewhat less than a turkey, and of the _chikor_\r\n   (partridge) species. It was procured for him first in\r\n   Ghūr-bund, but, when snow has fallen, it could be had nearer\r\n   Kābul. Bābur's _bū-qalamūn_ may have come into his vocabulary,\r\n   either as a survival direct from Greek occupation of Kābul and\r\n   Panj-āb, or through Arabic writings. PRGS 1879 p. 251, Kaye's\r\n   art. and JASB 1838 p. 863, Hodgson's art.\r\n\r\n   [803] Bartavelle's _Greek-partridge_, _tetrao-_ or\r\n   _perdrix-rufus_ [f. 279 and Mems. p. 320 n.].\r\n\r\n   [804] A similar story is told of some fields near\r\n   Whitby:—\"These wild geese, which in winter fly in great flocks\r\n   to the lakes and rivers unfrozen in the southern parts, to the\r\n   great amazement of every-one, fall suddenly down upon the\r\n   ground when they are in flight over certain neighbouring\r\n   fields thereabouts; a relation I should not have made, if I\r\n   had not received it from several credible men.\" See _Notes to\r\n   Marmion_ p. xlvi (Erskine); Scott's _Poems_, Black's ed. 1880,\r\n   vii, 104.\r\n\r\n   [805] Are we to infer from this that the musk-rat (_Crocidura\r\n   cœrulea_, Lydekker, p. 626) was not so common in Hindūstān in\r\n   the age of Bābur as it has now become? He was not a careless\r\n   observer (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [806] Index _s.n._ _Bābur-nāma_, date of composition; also f.\r\n   131.\r\n\r\n   [807] In the absence of examples of _bund_ to mean _kūtal_,\r\n   and the presence \"in those countries\" of many in which _bund_\r\n   means _koh_, it looks as though a clerical error had here\r\n   written _kūtal_ for _koh_. But on the other hand, the wording\r\n   of the next passage shows just the confusion an author's\r\n   unrevised draft might shew if a place were, as this is, both a\r\n   _tūmān_ and a _kūtal_ (_i.e._ a steady rise to a traverse). My\r\n   impression is that the name Ghūr-bund applies to the embanking\r\n   spur at the head of the valley-_tūmān_, across which roads\r\n   lead to Ghūrī and Ghūr (PRGS 1879, Maps; Leech's Report VII;\r\n   and Wood's VI).\r\n\r\n   [808] So too when, because of them, Leech and Lord turned\r\n   back, _re infectâ_.\r\n\r\n   [809] It will be noticed that these villages are not classed\r\n   in any _tūmān_; they include places \"rich without parallel\" in\r\n   agricultural products, and level lands on which towns have\r\n   risen and fallen, one being Alexandria ad Caucasum. They\r\n   cannot have been part of the unremunerative Ghūr-bund _tūmān_;\r\n   from their place of mention in Bābur's list of _tūmāns_, they\r\n   may have been part of the Kābul _tūmān_ (f. 178), as was\r\n   Koh-dāman (Burnes' _Cabool_ p. 154; Haughton's _Charikar_ p.\r\n   73; and Cunningham's _Ancient History_, i, 18).\r\n\r\n   [810] Dūr-namāī, seen from afar (Masson, iii, 152) is not\r\n   marked on the Survey Maps; Masson, Vigne and Haughton locate\r\n   it. Bābur's \"head\" and \"foot\" here indicate status and not\r\n   location.\r\n\r\n   [811] Mems. p. 146 and _Méms_, i, 297, Arabs' encampment and\r\n   _Cellule des Arabes_. Perhaps the name may refer to uses of\r\n   the level land and good pasture by horse _qāfilas_, since\r\n   _Kurra_ is written with _tashdīd_ in the Ḥaidarābād Codex, as\r\n   in _kurra-tāz_, a horse-breaker. Or the _tāziyān_ may be the\r\n   fruit of a legend, commonly told, that the saint of the\r\n   neighbouring Running-sands was an Arabian.\r\n\r\n   [812] Presumably this is the grass of the millet, the growth\r\n   before the ear, on which grazing is allowed (Elphinstone, i,\r\n   400; Burnes, p. 237).\r\n\r\n   [813] Wood, p. 115; Masson, iii, 167; Burnes, p. 157 and JASB\r\n   1838 p. 324 with illustration; Vigne, pp. 219, 223; Lord, JASB\r\n   1838 p. 537; _Cathay and the way thither_, Hakluyt Society\r\n   vol. I. p. xx, para. 49; _History of Musical Sands_, C.\r\n   Carus-Wilson.\r\n\r\n   [814] _West_ might be more exact, since some of the group are\r\n   a little north, others a little south of the latitude of\r\n   Kābul.\r\n\r\n   [815] Affluents and not true sources in some cases (Col.\r\n   Holdich's _Gates of India_, _s.n._ Koh-i-bābā; and PRGS 1879,\r\n   maps pp. 80 and 160).\r\n\r\n   [816] The Pamghān range. These are the villages every\r\n   traveller celebrates. Masson's and Vigne's illustrations\r\n   depict them well.\r\n\r\n   [817] _Cercis siliquastrum_, the Judas-tree. Even in 1842 it\r\n   was sparingly found near Kābul, adorning a few tombs, one\r\n   Bābur's own. It had been brought from Sih-yārān where, as also\r\n   at Chārikār, (Chār-yak-kār) it was still abundant and still a\r\n   gorgeous sight. It is there a tree, as at Kew, and not a bush,\r\n   as in most English gardens (Masson, ii, 9; Elphinstone, i,\r\n   194; and for the tree near Harāt, f. 191 n. to Ṣafar).\r\n\r\n   [818] Khwāja Maudūd of Chisht, Khwāja Khāwand Sa`īd and the\r\n   Khwāja of the Running-sands (Elph. MS. f. 104b, marginal\r\n   note).\r\n\r\n   [819] The yellow-flowered plant is not _cercis siliquastrum_\r\n   but one called _mahaka_(?) in Persian, a shrubby plant with\r\n   pea-like blossoms, common in the plains of Persia, Bilūchistān\r\n   and Kābul (Masson, iii, 9 and Vigne, p. 216).\r\n\r\n   [820] The numerical value of these words gives 925 (Erskine).\r\n   F. 246b _et seq._ for the expedition.\r\n\r\n   [821] f. 178. I.O. MS. No. 724, _Haft-iqlīm_ f. 135 (Ethé, p.\r\n   402); Rieu, pp. 21_a_, 1058_b_.\r\n\r\n   [822] of Afghan habit. The same term is applied (f. 139b) to\r\n   the Zurmutīs; it may be explained in both places by Bābur's\r\n   statement that Zurmutīs grow corn, but do not cultivate\r\n   gardens or orchards.\r\n\r\n   [823] _aīkān dūr._ Sabuk-tīgīn, d. 387 AH.-997 AD., was the\r\n   father of Sl. Maḥmūd _Ghaznawī_, d. 421 AH.-1030 AD.\r\n\r\n   [824] d. 602 AH.-1206 AD.\r\n\r\n   [825] Some Musalmāns fast through the months of Rajab, Sha`bān\r\n   and Ramẓān; Muḥammadans fast only by day; the night is often\r\n   given to feasting (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [826] The Garden; the tombs of more eminent Muṣalmāns are\r\n   generally in gardens (Erskine). See Vigne's illustrations, pp.\r\n   133, 266.\r\n\r\n   [827] _i.e._ the year now in writing. The account of the\r\n   expedition, Bābur's first into Hindūstān, begins on f. 145.\r\n\r\n   [828] _i.e._ the countries groupable as Khurāsān.\r\n\r\n   [829] For picture and account of the dam, _see_ Vigne, pp.\r\n   138, 202.\r\n\r\n   [830] f. 295b.\r\n\r\n   [831] The legend is told in numerous books with varying\r\n   location of the spring. One narrator, Zakarīyā _Qazwīnī_,\r\n   reverses the parts, making Jāī-pāl employ the ruse; hence\r\n   Leyden's note (Mems. p. 150; E. and D.'s _History of India_\r\n   ii, 20, 182 and iv, 162; for historical information, R.'s\r\n   _Notes_ p. 320). The date of the events is shortly after 378\r\n   AH.-988 AD.\r\n\r\n   [832] R.'s _Notes_ _s.n._ Zurmut.\r\n\r\n   [833] The question of the origin of the Farmūlī has been\r\n   written of by several writers; perhaps they were Turks of\r\n   Persia, Turks and Tājīks.\r\n\r\n   [834] This completes the list of the 14 _tūmāns_ of Kābul,\r\n   _viz._ Nīngnahār, `Alī-shang, Alangār, Mandrāwar,\r\n   Kūnār-with-Nūr-gal, Nijr-aū, Panjhīr, Ghūr-bund, Koh-dāman\r\n   (with Kohistān?), Luhūgur (of the Kābul _tūmān_), Ghaznī,\r\n   Zurmut, Farmūl and Bangash.\r\n\r\n   [835] Between Nijr-aū and Tag-aū (Masson, iii, 165). Mr.\r\n   Erskine notes that Bābur reckoned it in the hot climate but\r\n   that the change of climate takes place further east, between\r\n   `Alī-shang and Aūzbīn (_i.e._ the valley next eastwards from\r\n   Tag-aū).\r\n\r\n   [836] _būghūzlārīghā furṣat būlmās_; _i.e._ to kill them in\r\n   the lawful manner, while pronouncing the _Bi'smi'llāh_.\r\n\r\n   [837] This completes the _bulūks_ of Kābul _viz._ Badr-aū\r\n   (Tag-aū), Nūr-valley, Chaghān-sarāī, Kāma and Ālā-sāī.\r\n\r\n   [838] The _rūpī_ being equal to 2-1/2 _shāhrukhīs_, the\r\n   _shāhrukhī_ may be taken at 10_d._ thus making the total\r\n   revenue only £33,333 6_s._ 8_d._ See _Āyīn-i-akbarī_ ii, 169\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [839] _sic_ in all B. N. MSS. Most maps print Khost. Muḥ.\r\n   Ṣāliḥ says of Khwāst, \"Who sees it, would call it a Hell\"\r\n   (Vambéry, p. 361).\r\n\r\n   [840] Bābur's statement about this fodder is not easy to\r\n   translate; he must have seen grass grow in tufts, and must\r\n   have known the Persian word _būta_ (bush). Perhaps _kāh_\r\n   should be read to mean plant, not grass. Would Wood's _bootr_\r\n   fit in, a small furze bush, very plentiful near Bāmiān?\r\n   (Wood's Report VI, p. 23; and for regional grasses,\r\n   Aitchison's _Botany of the Afghān Delimitation Commission_, p.\r\n   122.)\r\n\r\n   [841] _nāzū_, perhaps _cupressus torulosa_ (Brandis, p.693).\r\n\r\n   [842] f. 276.\r\n\r\n   [843] A laborious geographical note of Mr. Erskine's is here\r\n   regretfully left behind, as now needless (Mems. p. 152).\r\n\r\n   [844] Here, mainly wild-sheep and wild-goats, including\r\n   _mār-khẉār_.\r\n\r\n   [845] Perhaps, no conifers; perhaps none of those of the\r\n   contrasted hill-tract.\r\n\r\n   [846] While here _dasht_ (plain) represents the eastern skirt\r\n   of the Mehtar Sulaimān range, _dūkī_ or _dūgī_ (desert) seems\r\n   to stand for the hill tracts on the west of it, and not, as on\r\n   f. 152, for the place there specified.\r\n\r\n   [847] Mems. p. 152, \"A narrow place is large to the\r\n   narrow-minded\"; _Méms._ i, 311, \"Ce qui n'est pas trop large,\r\n   ne reste pas vide.\" Literally, \"So long as heights are not\r\n   equal, there is no vis-a-vis,\" or, if _tāng_ be read for\r\n   _tīng_, \"No dawn, no noon,\" _i.e._ no effect without a cause.\r\n\r\n   [848] I have not lighted on this name in botanical books or\r\n   explained by dictionaries. Perhaps it is a Cis-oxanian name\r\n   for the _sax-aol_ of Transoxania. As its uses are enumerated\r\n   by some travellers, it might be _Haloxylon ammodendron_,\r\n   _ta-ghas etc._ and _sax-aol_ (Aitchison, p. 102).\r\n\r\n   [849] f. 135b note to Ghūr-bund.\r\n\r\n   [850] I understand that wild-goats, wild-sheep and deer\r\n   (_āhū_) were not localized, but that the dun-sheep migrated\r\n   through. Antelope (_āhū_) was scarce in Elphinstone's time.\r\n\r\n   [851] _qīzīl kīyik_ which, taken with its alternative name,\r\n   _arqārghalcha_, allows it to be the dun-sheep of Wood's\r\n   _Journey_ p. 241. From its second name it may be _Ovis amnon_\r\n   (_Raos_), or _O. argalī_.\r\n\r\n   [852] _tusqāwal_, var. _tutqāwal_, _tus̱aqāwal_ and\r\n   _tūshqāwal_, a word which has given trouble to scribes and\r\n   translators. As a sporting-term it is equivalent to\r\n   _shikār-i-nihilam_; in one or other of its forms I find it\r\n   explained as _Weg-hüter_, _Fahnen-hüter_, _Zahl-meister_,\r\n   _Schlucht_, _Gefahrlicher-weg_ and _Schmaler-weg_. It recurs\r\n   in the B.N. on f. 197b l. 5 and l. 6 and there might mean\r\n   either a narrow road or a _Weg-hüter_. If its Turkī root be\r\n   _tūs_, the act of stopping, all the above meanings can follow,\r\n   but there may be two separate roots, the second, _tūsh_, the\r\n   act of descent (JRAS 1900 p. 137, H. Beveridge's art. _On the\r\n   word nihilam_).\r\n\r\n   [853] _qūshlīk_, _aītlīk_. Elphinstone writes (i, 191) of the\r\n   excellent greyhounds and hawking birds of the region; here the\r\n   bird may be the _charkh_, which works with the dogs, fastening\r\n   on the head of the game (Von Schwarz, p. 117, for the same use\r\n   of eagles).\r\n\r\n   [854] An antelope resembling the usual one of Hindūstān is\r\n   common south of Ghaznī (Vigne, p. 110); what is not found may\r\n   be some classes of wild-sheep, frequent further north, at\r\n   higher elevation, and in places more familiar to Bābur.\r\n\r\n   [855] The Parwān or Hindū-kush pass, concerning the winds of\r\n   which _see_ f. 128.\r\n\r\n   [856] _tūrnā u qarqara_; the second of which is the Hindī\r\n   _būglā_, heron, _egret ardea gazetta_, the furnisher of the\r\n   aigrette of commerce.\r\n\r\n   [857] The _aūqār_ is _ardea cinerea_, the grey heron; the\r\n   _qarqara_ is _ardea gazetta_, the egret. _Qūṯān_ is explained\r\n   in the Elph. Codex (f. 110) by _khawāsil_, goldfinch, but the\r\n   context concerns large birds; Scully (Shaw's Voc.) has\r\n   _qodan_, water-hen, which suits better.\r\n\r\n   [858] _giz_, the short-flight arrow.\r\n\r\n   [859] a small, round-headed nail with which a whip-handle is\r\n   decorated (Vambéry). Such a stud would keep the cord from\r\n   slipping through the fingers and would not check the\r\n   arrow-release.\r\n\r\n   [860] It has been understood (Mems. p. 158 and _Méms._ i, 313)\r\n   that the arrow was flung by hand but if this were so,\r\n   something heavier than the _giz_ would carry the cord better,\r\n   since it certainly would be difficult to direct a missile so\r\n   light as an arrow without the added energy of the bow. The\r\n   arrow itself will often have found its billet in the\r\n   closely-flying flock; the cord would retrieve the bird. The\r\n   verb used in the text is _aītmāq_, the one common to express\r\n   the discharge of arrows _etc._\r\n\r\n   [861] For Tīmūrids who may have immigrated the fowlers _see_\r\n   Raverty's _Notes_ p. 579 and his Appendix p. 22.\r\n\r\n   [862] _milwāh_; this has been read by all earlier translators,\r\n   and also by the Persian annotator of the Elph. Codex, to mean\r\n   _shākh_, bough. For decoy-ducks _see_ Bellew's _Notes on\r\n   Afghānistān_ p. 404.\r\n\r\n   [863] _qūlān qūyirūghī._ Amongst the many plants used to drug\r\n   fish I have not found this one mentioned. _Khār-zāhra_ and\r\n   _khār-fāq_ approach it in verbal meaning; the first describes\r\n   colocynth, the second, wild rue. See Watts' _Economic Products\r\n   of India_ iii, 366 and Bellew's _Notes_ pp. 182, 471 and 478.\r\n\r\n   [864] Much trouble would have been spared to himself and his\r\n   translators, if Bābur had known a lobster-pot.\r\n\r\n   [865] The fish, it is to be inferred, came down the fall into\r\n   the pond.\r\n\r\n   [866] Burnes and Vigne describe a fall 20 miles from Kābul, at\r\n   \"Tangī Gharoi\", [below where the Tag-aū joins the\r\n   Bārān-water,] to which in their day, Kābulīs went out for the\r\n   amusement of catching fish as they try to leap up the fall.\r\n   Were these migrants seeking upper waters or were they captives\r\n   in a fish-pond?\r\n\r\n   [867] Elph. MS. f. 111; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 116b and 217 f.\r\n   97b; Mems. p. 155; _Méms._ i, 318.\r\n\r\n   [868] _mihmān-beglār_, an expression first used by Bābur here,\r\n   and due, presumably, to accessions from Khusrau Shāh's\r\n   following. A parallel case is given in Max Müller's _Science\r\n   of Language_ i, 348 ed. 1871, \"Turkmān tribes ... call\r\n   themselves, not subjects, but guests of the Uzbeg Khāns.\"\r\n\r\n   [869] _tiyūl-dīk_ in all the Turkī MSS. Ilminsky, de\r\n   Courteille and Zenker, _yitūl-dīk_, Turkī, a fief.\r\n\r\n   [870] _Wilāyat khūd hech bīrīlmādī_; W.-i-B. 215 f. 116b,\r\n   _Wilāyat dāda na shuda_ and 217 f. 97b, _Wilāyat khūd hech\r\n   dāda na shud_. By this I understand that he kept the lands of\r\n   Kābul itself in his own hands. He mentions (f. 350) and\r\n   Gul-badan mentions (H.N. f. 40b) his resolve so to keep Kābul.\r\n   I think he kept not only the fort but all lands constituting\r\n   the Kābul _tūmān_ (f. 135b and note).\r\n\r\n   [871] _Saifī dūr, qalamī aīmās_, _i.e._ tax is taken by force,\r\n   not paid on a written assessment.\r\n\r\n   [872] _khar-wār_, about 700 lbs Averdupois (Erskine). Cf.\r\n   _Āyīn-i-akbarī_ (Jarrett, ii, 394).\r\n\r\n   [873] Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad and Badāyūnī both mention this script\r\n   and say that in it Bābur transcribed a copy of the Qorān for\r\n   presentation to Makka. Badāyūnī says it was unknown in his\r\n   day, the reign of Akbar (_T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_, lith. ed. p.\r\n   193, and _Muntakhabu't-tawārīkh_ Bib. Ind. ed. iii, 273).\r\n\r\n   [874] Bābur's route, taken with one given by Raverty (_Notes_\r\n   p. 691), allows these Hazāras, about whose location Mr.\r\n   Erskine was uncertain, to be located between the Takht-pass\r\n   (Arghandī-Maidān-Unai road), on their east, and the Sang-lākh\r\n   mountains, on their west.\r\n\r\n   [875] The Takht-pass, one on which from times immemorial, toll\r\n   (_nirkh_) has been taken.\r\n\r\n   [876] _khāṯir-khwāh chāpīlmādī_, which perhaps implies mutual\r\n   discontent, Bābur's with his gains, the Hazāras' with their\r\n   losses. As the second Persian translation omits the negative,\r\n   the Memoirs does the same.\r\n\r\n   [877] Bhīra being in Shāhpūr, this Khān's _daryā_ will be the\r\n   Jehlam.\r\n\r\n   [878] Bābur uses Persian _dasht_ and Hindī _dūkī_, plain and\r\n   hill, for the tracts east and west of Mehtar Sulaimān. The\r\n   first, _dasht_, stands for Dāman (skirt) and Dara-i-jāt, the\r\n   second, _dūkī_, indefinitely for the broken lands west of the\r\n   main range, but also, in one instance for the Dūkī [Dūgī]\r\n   district of Qandahār, as will be noted.\r\n\r\n   [879] f. 132. The Jagdālīk-pass for centuries has separated\r\n   the districts of Kābul and Nīngnahār. Forster (_Travels_ ii,\r\n   68), making the journey the reverse way, was sensible of the\r\n   climatic change some 3m. east of Gandamak. Cf. Wood's _Report_\r\n   I. p. 6.\r\n\r\n   [880] These are they whose families Nāṣir Mīrzā shepherded out\r\n   of Kābul later (f. 154, f. 155).\r\n\r\n   [881] Bird's-dome, opposite the mouth of the Kūnār-water\r\n   (_S.A. War_, Map p. 64).\r\n\r\n   [882] This word is variously pointed and is uncertain. Mr.\r\n   Erskine adopted \"Pekhi\", but, on the whole, it may be best to\r\n   read, here and on f. 146, Ar. _fajj_ or pers. _paj_, mountain\r\n   or pass. To do so shews the guide to be one located in the\r\n   Khaibar-pass, a _Fajjī_ or _Pajī_.\r\n\r\n   [883] mod. Jām-rūd (Jām-torrent), presumably.\r\n\r\n   [884] G. of I. xx, 125 and Cunningham's _Ancient History_ i,\r\n   80. Bābur saw the place in 925 AH. (f. 232b).\r\n\r\n   [885] Cunningham, p. 29. Four ancient sites, not far removed\r\n   from one another, bear this name, Bīgrām, _viz._ those near\r\n   Hūpīān, Kābul, Jalālābād and Pashāwar.\r\n\r\n   [886] Cunningham, i, 79.\r\n\r\n   [887] Perhaps a native of Kamarī on the Indus, but _kamarī_ is\r\n   a word of diverse application (index _s.n._).\r\n\r\n   [888] The annals of this campaign to the eastward shew that\r\n   Bābur was little of a free agent; that many acts of his own\r\n   were merciful; that he sets down the barbarity of others as it\r\n   was, according to his plan of writing (f. 86); and that he had\r\n   with him undisciplined robbers of Khusrau Shāh's former\r\n   following. He cannot be taken as having power to command or\r\n   control the acts of those, his guest-begs and their following,\r\n   who dictated his movements in this disastrous journey, one\r\n   worse than a defeat, says Ḥaidar Mīrzā.\r\n\r\n   [889] For the route here _see_ Masson, i, 117 and Colquhoun's\r\n   _With the Kuram Field-force_ p. 48.\r\n\r\n   [890] The Ḥai. MS. writes this Dilah-zāk.\r\n\r\n   [891] _i.e._ raised a force in Bābur's name. He took advantage\r\n   of this _farmān_ in 911 AH. to kill Bāqī _Chagkānīānī_ (f.\r\n   159b-160).\r\n\r\n   [892] Of the Yūsuf-zāī and Ranjīt-sīngh, Masson says, (i, 141)\r\n   \"The miserable, hunted wretches threw themselves on the\r\n   ground, and placing a blade or tuft of grass in their mouths,\r\n   cried out, \"I am your cow.\" This act and explanation, which\r\n   would have saved them from an orthodox Hindū, had no effect\r\n   with the infuriated Sikhs.\" This form of supplication is at\r\n   least as old as the days of Firdausī (Erskine, p. 159 n.). The\r\n   _Bahār-i-`ajam_ is quoted by Vullers as saying that in India,\r\n   suppliants take straw in the mouth to indicate that they are\r\n   blanched and yellow from fear.\r\n\r\n   [893] This barbarous custom has always prevailed amongst the\r\n   Tartar conquerors of Asia (Erskine). For examples under Timūr\r\n   _see_ Raverty's _Notes_ p. 137.\r\n\r\n   [894] For a good description of the road from Kohāt to Thāl\r\n   _see_ Bellew's _Mission_ p. 104.\r\n\r\n   [895] F. 88b has the same phrase about the doubtful courage of\r\n   one Sayyidī Qarā.\r\n\r\n   [896] Not to the mod. town of Bannū, [that having been begun\r\n   only in 1848 AD.] but wherever their wrong road brought them\r\n   out into the Bannū amphitheatre. The Survey Map of 1868, No.\r\n   15, shews the physical features of the wrong route.\r\n\r\n   [897] Perhaps he connived at recovery of cattle by those\r\n   raided already.\r\n\r\n   [898] Tāq is the Tank of Maps; Bāzār was s.w. of it. Tank for\r\n   Tāq looks to be a variant due to nasal utterance (Vigne, p.\r\n   77, p. 203 and Map; and, as bearing on the nasal, _in loco_,\r\n   Appendix E).\r\n\r\n   [899] If return had been made after over-running Bannū, it\r\n   would have been made by the Tochī-valley and so through\r\n   Farmūl; if after over-running the Plain, Bābur's details shew\r\n   that the westward turn was meant to be by the Gūmāl-valley and\r\n   one of two routes out of it, still to Farmūl; but the extended\r\n   march southward to near Dara-i-Ghazī Khān made the westward\r\n   turn be taken through the valley opening at Sakhī-sawār.\r\n\r\n   [900] This will mean, none of the artificial runlets familiar\r\n   where Bābur had lived before getting to know Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n   [901] _sauda-āt_, perhaps, pack-ponies, perhaps, bred for sale\r\n   and not for own use. Burnes observes that in 1837 Lūhānī\r\n   merchants carried precisely the same articles of trade as in\r\n   Bābur's day, 332 years earlier (_Report_ IX p. 99).\r\n\r\n   [902] Mr. Erskine thought it probable that the first of these\r\n   routes went through Kanigūram, and the second through the\r\n   Ghwālirī-pass and along the Gūmāl. _Birk_, fastness, would\r\n   seem an appropriate name for Kanigūram, but, if Bābur meant to\r\n   go to Ghaznī, he would be off the ordinary Gūmāl-Ghaznī route\r\n   in going through Farmūl (Aūrgūn). Raverty's _Notes_ give much\r\n   useful detail about these routes, drawn from native sources.\r\n   For Barak (Birk) _see_ _Notes_ pp. 88, 89; Vigne, p. 102.\r\n\r\n   [903] From this it would seem that the alternative roads were\r\n   approached by one in common.\r\n\r\n   [904] _tūmshūq_, a bird's bill, used here, as in Selsey-bill,\r\n   for the naze (nose), or snout, the last spur, of a range.\r\n\r\n   [905] Here these words may be common nouns.\r\n\r\n   [906] Nū-roz, the feast of the old Persian New-year (Erskine);\r\n   it is the day on which the Sun enters Aries.\r\n\r\n   [907] In the [Turkī] Elph. and Ḥai. MSS. and in some Persian\r\n   ones, there is a space left here as though to indicate a known\r\n   omission.\r\n\r\n   [908] _kamarī_, sometimes a cattle-enclosure, which may serve\r\n   as a _sangur_. The word may stand in one place of its\r\n   _Bābur-nāma_ uses for Gum-rāhī (R.'s _Notes_ _s.n._\r\n   Gum-rāhān).\r\n\r\n   [909] Index _s.n._\r\n\r\n   [910] Vigne, p. 241.\r\n\r\n   [911] This name can be translated \"He turns not back\" or \"He\r\n   stops not\".\r\n\r\n   [912] _i.e._ five from Bīlah.\r\n\r\n   [913] Raverty gives the saint's name as Pīr Kānūn (Ar.\r\n   _kānūn_, listened to). It is the well-known Sakhī-sarwār,\r\n   honoured hy Hindūs and Muḥammadans. (G. of I., xxi, 390; R.'s\r\n   _Notes_ p. 11 and p. 12 and JASB 1855; Calcutta Review 1875,\r\n   Macauliffe's art. _On the fair at Sakhi-sarwar_; Leech's\r\n   _Report_ VII, for the route; _Khazīnatu 'l-asfiyā_ iv, 245.)\r\n\r\n   [914] This seems to be the sub-district of Qandahār, Dūkī or\r\n   Dūgī.\r\n\r\n   [915] _khar-gāh_, a folding tent on lattice frame-work,\r\n   perhaps a _khibitka_.\r\n\r\n   [916] It may be more correct to write Kāh-mard, as the Ḥai.\r\n   MS. does and to understand in the name a reference to the\r\n   grass(_kāh_)-yielding capacity of the place.\r\n\r\n   [917] f. 121.\r\n\r\n   [918] This may mean, what irrigation has not used.\r\n\r\n   [919] Mr. Erskine notes that the description would lead us to\r\n   imagine a flock of flamingoes. Masson found the lake filled\r\n   with red-legged, white fowl (i, 262); these and also what\r\n   Bābur saw, may have been the China-goose which has body and\r\n   neck white, head and tail russet (Bellew's _Mission_ p. 402).\r\n   Broadfoot seems to have visited the lake when migrants were\r\n   few, and through this to have been led to adverse comment on\r\n   Bābur's accuracy (p. 350).\r\n\r\n   [920] The usual dryness of the bed may have resulted from the\r\n   irrigation of much land some 12 miles from Ghaznī.\r\n\r\n   [921] This is the Luhūgur (Logar) water, knee-deep in winter\r\n   at the ford but spreading in flood with the spring-rains.\r\n   Bābur, not being able to cross it for the direct roads into\r\n   Kābul, kept on along its left bank, crossing it eventually at\r\n   the Kamarī of maps, s.e. of Kābul.\r\n\r\n   [922] This disastrous expedition, full of privation and loss,\r\n   had occupied some four months (T.R. p. 201).\r\n\r\n   [923] f. 145b.\r\n\r\n   [924] f. 133b and Appendix F.\r\n\r\n   [925] They were located in Mandrāwar in 926 AH. (f. 251).\r\n\r\n   [926] This was done, manifestly, with the design of drawing\r\n   after the families their fighting men, then away with Bābur.\r\n\r\n   [927] f. 163. Shaibāq Khān besieged Chīn Ṣufī, Sl. Ḥusain\r\n   Mīrzā's man in Khwārizm (T. R. p. 204; _Shaibānī-nāma_,\r\n   Vambéry, Table of Contents and note 89).\r\n\r\n   [928] Survey Map 1889, Sadda. The Rāgh-water flows n.w. into\r\n   the Oxus (Amū).\r\n\r\n   [929] _birk_, a mountain stronghold; cf. f. 149b note to Birk\r\n   (Barak).\r\n\r\n   [930] They were thus driven on from the Bārān-water (f. 154b).\r\n\r\n   [931] f. 126b.\r\n\r\n   [932] Ḥiṣār, presumably.\r\n\r\n   [933] Here \"His Honour\" translates Bābur's clearly ironical\r\n   honorific plural.\r\n\r\n   [934] These two sulṯāns, almost always mentioned in alliance,\r\n   may be Tīmūrids by maternal descent (Index _s.nn._). So far I\r\n   have found no direct statement of their parentage. My husband\r\n   has shewn me what may be one indication of it, _viz._ that two\r\n   of the uncles of Shaibāq Khān (whose kinsmen the sulṯāns seem\r\n   to be), Qūj-kūnjī and Sīūnjak, were sons of a daughter of the\r\n   Tīmūrid Aūlūgh Beg _Samarkandī_ (Ḥ.S. ii, 318). _See_\r\n   Vambéry's _Bukhārā_ p. 248 note.\r\n\r\n   [935] For the deaths of Taṃbal and Maḥmūd, mentioned in the\r\n   above summary of Shaibāq Khān's actions, _see_ the\r\n   _Shaibānī-nāma_, Vambéry, p. 323.\r\n\r\n   [936] Ḥ.S. ii, 323, for Khusrau Shāh's character and death.\r\n\r\n   [937] f. 124.\r\n\r\n   [938] Khwāja-of-the-rhubarb, presumably a shrine near\r\n   rhubarb-grounds (f. 129b).\r\n\r\n   [939] _yakshī bārdīlār_, lit. went well, a common expression\r\n   in the _Bābur-nāma_, of which the reverse statement is\r\n   _yamānlīk bīla bārdī_ (f. 163). Some Persian MSS. make the\r\n   Mughūls disloyal but this is not only in opposition to the\r\n   Turkī text, it is a redundant statement since if disloyal,\r\n   they are included in Bābur's previous statement, as being\r\n   Khusrau Shāh's retainers. What might call for comment in\r\n   Mughūls would be loyalty to Bābur.\r\n\r\n   [940] Elph. MS. f. 121b: W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 126 and 217 f.\r\n   106b; Mems. p. 169.\r\n\r\n   [941] _tāgh-dāmanasī_, presumably the Koh-dāman, and the\r\n   garden will thus be the one of f. 136b.\r\n\r\n   [942] If these heirs were descendants of Aūlūgh Beg M. one\r\n   would be at hand in `Abdu'r-razzāq, then a boy, and another, a\r\n   daughter, was the wife of Muqīm _Arghūn_. As Mr. Erskine\r\n   notes, Musalmāns are most scrupulous not to bury their dead in\r\n   ground gained by violence or wrong.\r\n\r\n   [943] The news of Aḥmad's death was belated; he died some 13\r\n   months earlier, in the end of 909 AH. and in Eastern\r\n   Turkistān. Perhaps details now arrived.\r\n\r\n   [944] _i.e._ the fortieth day of mourning, when alms are\r\n   given.\r\n\r\n   [945] Of those arriving, the first would find her\r\n   step-daughter dead, the second her sister, the third, his late\r\n   wife's sister (T. R. p. 196).\r\n\r\n   [946] This will be the earthquake felt in Agra on Ṣafar 3rd\r\n   911 AH. (July 5th 1505 AD. Erskine's _History of India_ i, 229\r\n   note). Cf. Elliot and Dowson, iv, 465 and v, 99.\r\n\r\n   [947] Raverty's _Notes_ p. 690.\r\n\r\n   [948] _bīr kitta tāsh ātīmī_; var. _bāsh ātīmī_. If _tāsh_ be\r\n   right, the reference will probably be to the throw of a\r\n   catapult.\r\n\r\n   [949] Here almost certainly, a drummer, because there were two\r\n   tambours and because also Bābur uses _`aūdī_ & _ghachakī_ for\r\n   the other meanings of _ṯambourchi_, lutanist and guitarist.\r\n   The word has found its way, as _tambourgi_, into Childe\r\n   Harold's Pilgrimage (Canto ii, lxxii. H. B.).\r\n\r\n   [950] Kābul-Ghaznī road (R.'s _Notes_ index _s.n._).\r\n\r\n   [951] var. Yārī. Tāzī is on the Ghaznī-Qalāt-i-ghilzāī road\r\n   (R.'s _Notes_, Appendix p. 46).\r\n\r\n   [952] _i.e._ in Kābul and in the Trans-Himalayan country.\r\n\r\n   [953] These will be those against Bābur's suzerainty done by\r\n   their defence of Qalāt for Muqīm.\r\n\r\n   [954] _tabaqa_, dynasty. By using this word Bābur shews\r\n   recognition of high birth. It is noticeable that he usually\r\n   writes of an Arghūn chief either simply as \"Beg\" or without a\r\n   title. This does not appear to imply admission of equality,\r\n   since he styles even his brothers and sisters Mīrzā and Begīm;\r\n   nor does it shew familiarity of intercourse, since none seems\r\n   to have existed between him and Ẕū'n-nūn or Muqīm. That he did\r\n   not admit equality is shewn on f. 208. The T.R. styles\r\n   Ẕū'n-nūn \"Mīrzā\", a title by which, as also by Shāh, his\r\n   descendants are found styled (A.-i-a. Blochmann, _s.n._).\r\n\r\n   [955] Turkī _khachar_ is a camel or mule used for carrying\r\n   personal effects. The word has been read by some scribes as\r\n   _khanjar_, dagger.\r\n\r\n   [956] In 910 AH. he had induced Bābur to come to Kābul instead\r\n   of going into Khurāsān (Ḥ.S. iii, 319); in the same year he\r\n   dictated the march to Kohāt, and the rest of that disastrous\r\n   travel. His real name was not Bāqī but Muḥammad Bāqir (Ḥ.S.\r\n   iii, 311).\r\n\r\n   [957] These transit or custom duties are so called because the\r\n   dutiable articles are stamped with a _ṯamghā_, a wooden stamp.\r\n\r\n   [958] Perhaps this word is an equivalent of Persian _goshī_, a\r\n   tax on cattle and beasts of burden.\r\n\r\n   [959] Bāqī was one only and not the head of the Lords of the\r\n   Gate.\r\n\r\n   [960] The choice of the number nine, links on presumably to\r\n   the mystic value attached to it _e.g._ Tarkhāns had nine\r\n   privileges; gifts were made by nines.\r\n\r\n   [961] It is near Ḥasan-abdāl (A.-i-A. Jarrett, ii, 324).\r\n\r\n   [962] For the _farmān_, f. 146b; for Gujūrs, G. of I.\r\n\r\n   [963] var. Khwesh. Its water flows into the Ghūr-bund stream;\r\n   it seems to be the Dara-i-Turkmān of Stanford and the Survey\r\n   Maps both of which mark Janglīk. For Hazāra turbulence, f.\r\n   135b and note.\r\n\r\n   [964] The repetition of _aūq_ in this sentence can hardly be\r\n   accidental.\r\n\r\n   [965] _ṯaur_ [_dara_], which I take to be Turkī, round,\r\n   complete.\r\n\r\n   [966] Three MSS. of the Turkī text write _bīr sīmīzlūq tīwah_;\r\n   but the two Persian translations have _yak shuturlūq farbīh_,\r\n   a _shuturlūq_ being a baggage-camel with little hair\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [967] _brochettes_, meat cut into large mouthfuls, spitted and\r\n   roasted.\r\n\r\n   [968] Perhaps he was officially an announcer; the word means\r\n   also bearer of good news.\r\n\r\n   [969] _yīlāng_, without mail, as in the common phrase _yīgīt\r\n   yīlāng_, a bare brave.\r\n\r\n   [970] _aūpchīn_, of horse and man (f. 113b and note).\r\n\r\n   [971] Manifestly Bābur means that he twice actually helped to\r\n   collect the booty.\r\n\r\n   [972] This is that part of a horse covered by the two\r\n   side-pieces of a Turkī saddle, from which the side-arch\r\n   springs on either side (Shaw).\r\n\r\n   [973] _Bārān-nīng ayāghī._ Except the river I have found\r\n   nothing called Bārān; the village marked Baian on the French\r\n   Map would suit the position; it is n.e. of Chār-yak-kār (f.\r\n   184b note).\r\n\r\n   [974] _i.e._ prepared to fight.\r\n\r\n   [975] For the Hazāra (Turkī, Mīng) on the Mīrzā's road _see_\r\n   Raverty's routes from Ghaznī to the north. An account given by\r\n   the _Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_ (p. 196) of Jahāngīr's doings is\r\n   confused; its parenthetical \"(at the same time)\" can hardly be\r\n   correct. Jahāngīr left Ghaznī now, (911 AH.), as Bābur left\r\n   Kābul in 912 AH. without knowledge of Ḥusain's death (911\r\n   AH.). Bābur had heard it (f. 183b) before Jahāngīr joined him\r\n   (912 AH.); after their meeting they went on together to Herī.\r\n   The petition of which the T. R. speaks as made by Jahāngīr to\r\n   Bābur, that he might go into Khurāsān and help the Bāī-qarā\r\n   Mīrzās must have been made after the meeting of the two at\r\n   Ṣaf-hill (f. 184b).\r\n\r\n   [976] The plurals _they_ and _their_ of the preceding sentence\r\n   stand no doubt for the Mīrzā, Yūsuf and Buhlūl who all had\r\n   such punishment due as would lead them to hear threat in\r\n   Qāsim's words now when all were within Bābur's pounce.\r\n\r\n   [977] These are the _aīmāqs_ from which the fighting-men went\r\n   east with Bābur in 910 AH. and the families in which Nāṣir\r\n   shepherded across Hindu-kush (f. 154 and f. 155).\r\n\r\n   [978] _yamānlīk bīla bārdī_; cf. f. 156b and n. for its\r\n   opposite, _yakhshī bārdīlār_; and T. R. p. 196.\r\n\r\n   [979] One might be of mail, the other of wadded cloth.\r\n\r\n   [980] Chīn Ṣūfī was Ḥusain _Bāī-qarā's_ man (T.R. p. 204). His\r\n   arduous defence, faithfulness and abandonment recall the\r\n   instance of a later time when also a long road stretched\r\n   between the man and the help that failed him. But the Mīrzā\r\n   was old, his military strength was, admittedly, sapped by\r\n   ease; hence his elder Khartum, his neglect of his Gordon.\r\n\r\n   It should be noted that no mention of the page's fatal arrow\r\n   is made by the _Shaibānī-nāma_ (Vambéry, p. 442), or by the\r\n   _Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_ (p. 204). Chīn Ṣūfī's death was on the 21st\r\n   of the Second Rabī 911 AH. (Aug. 22nd 1505 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [981] This may be the \"Baboulei\" of the French Map of 1904, on\r\n   the Herī-Kushk-Marūchāq road.\r\n\r\n   [982] Elph. MS. f. 127; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 132 and 217 f.\r\n   111b; Mems. p. 175; _Méms._ i, 364.\r\n\r\n   That Bābur should have given his laborious account of the\r\n   Court of Herī seems due both to loyalty to a great Tīmūrid,\r\n   seated in Tīmūr Beg's place (f. 122b), and to his own\r\n   interest, as a man-of-letters and connoisseur in excellence,\r\n   in that ruler's galaxy of talent. His account here opening is\r\n   not complete; its sources are various; they include the\r\n   _Ḥabību's-siyār_ and what he will have learned himself in Herī\r\n   or from members of the Bāī-qarā family, knowledgeable women\r\n   some of them, who were with him in Hindūstān. The narrow scope\r\n   of my notes shews that they attempt no more than to indicate\r\n   further sources of information and to clear up a few\r\n   obscurities.\r\n\r\n   [983] Tīmūr's youngest son, d. 850 AH. (1446 AD.). Cf. Ḥ.S.\r\n   iii, 203. The use in this sentence of Amīr and not Beg as\r\n   Tīmūr's title is, up to this point, unique in the\r\n   _Bābur-nāma_; it may be a scribe's error.\r\n\r\n   [984] Fīrūza's paternal line of descent was as\r\n   follows:—Fīrūza, daughter of Sl. Ḥusain _Qānjūt_, son of Ākā\r\n   Begīm, daughter of Tīmūr. Her maternal descent was:—Fīrūza, d.\r\n   of Qūtlūq-sulṯān Begīm, d. of Mīrān-shāh, s. of Tīmūr. She\r\n   died Muḥ. 24th 874 AH. (July 25th 1489 AD. Ḥ.S. iii, 218).\r\n\r\n   [985] \"No-one in the world had such parentage\", writes\r\n   Khwānd-amīr, after detailing the Tīmūrid, Chīngīz-khānid, and\r\n   other noted strains meeting in Ḥusain _Bāī-qarā_ (Ḥ.S. iii,\r\n   204).\r\n\r\n   [986] The Elph. MS. gives the Begīm no name; Badī`u'l-jamāl is\r\n   correct (Ḥ.S. iii, 242). The curious \"Badka\" needs\r\n   explanation. It seems probable that Bābur left one of his\r\n   blanks for later filling-in; the natural run of his sentence\r\n   here is \"Ākā B. and Badī`u'l-jamāl B.\" and not the detail,\r\n   which follows in its due place, about the marriage with Aḥmad.\r\n\r\n   [987] _Dīwān bāshīdā ḥāṣir būlmās aīdī_; the sense of which\r\n   may be that Bāī-qarā did not sit where the premier retainer\r\n   usually sat at the head of the Court (Pers. trs.\r\n   _sar-i-dīwān_).\r\n\r\n   [988] From this Wais and Sl. Ḥusain M.'s daughter Sulṯānīm (f.\r\n   167b) were descended the Bāī-qarā Mīrzās who gave Akbar so\r\n   much trouble.\r\n\r\n   [989] As this man might be mistaken for Bābur's uncle (_q.v._)\r\n   of the same name, it may be well to set down his parentage. He\r\n   was a s. of Mīrzā Sayyidī Aḥmad, s. of Mīrān-shāh, s. of Tīmūr\r\n   (Ḥ.S. iii, 217, 241). I have not found mention elsewhere of\r\n   \"Aḥmad s. of Mīrān-shāh\"; the _sayyidī_ in his style points to\r\n   a sayyida mother. He was Governor of Herī for a time, for Sl.\r\n   H.M.; `Alī-sher has notices of him and of his son, Kīchīk\r\n   Mīrzā (_Journal Asiatique_ xvii, 293, M. Belin's art. where\r\n   may be seen notices of many other men mentioned by Bābur).\r\n\r\n   [990] He collected and thus preserved `Alī-sher's earlier\r\n   poems (Rieu's Pers. Cat. p. 294). Mu'inu'd-dīn al Zamji writes\r\n   respectfully of his being worthy of credence in some Egyptian\r\n   matters with which he became acquainted in twice passing\r\n   through that country on his Pilgrimage (_Journal Asiatique_\r\n   xvi, 476, de Meynard's article).\r\n\r\n   [991] Kīchīk M.'s quatrain is a mere plagiarism of Jāmī's\r\n   which I am indebted to my husband for locating as in the\r\n   _Dīwān_ I.O. MS. 47 p. 47; B.M. Add. 7774 p. 290; and Add.\r\n   7775 p. 285. M. Belin interprets the verse as an expression of\r\n   the rise of the average good man to mystical rapture, not as\r\n   his lapse from abstinence to indulgence (l.c. xvii, 296 and\r\n   notes).\r\n\r\n   [992] Elph.

Ḥusain's guerilla wars were those\r\n   through which he cut his way to the throne of Herī. This begīm\r\n   was married first to Pīr Budāgh Sl. (Ḥ.S. iii, 242); he dying,\r\n   she was married by Aḥmad, presumably by levirate custom\r\n   (_yīnkālīk_; f. 12 and note). By Aḥmad she had a daughter,\r\n   styled Khān-zāda Begīm whose affairs find comment on f. 206\r\n   and Ḥ.S. iii, 359. (The details of this note negative a\r\n   suggestion of mine that Badka was the Rābī`a-sulṯān of f. 168\r\n   (Gul-badan, App. _s. nn._).)\r\n\r\n   [994] This is a felt wide-awake worn by travellers in hot\r\n   weather (Shaw); the Turkmān bonnet (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [995] Ḥai. MS. _yamānlīk_, badly, but Elph. MS. _namāyan_,\r\n   whence Erskine's _showy_.\r\n\r\n   [996] This was a proof that he was then a Shī`a (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [997] The word _perform_ may be excused in speaking of\r\n   Musalmān prayers because they involve ceremonial bendings and\r\n   prostrations (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [998] If Bābur's 40 include rule in Herī only, it over-states,\r\n   since Yādgār died in 875 AH. and Ḥusain in 911 AH. while the\r\n   intervening 36 years include the 5 or 6 temperate ones. If the\r\n   40 count from 861 AH. when Ḥusain began to rule in Merv, it\r\n   under-states. It is a round number, apparently.\r\n\r\n   [999] Relying on the Ilminsky text, Dr. Rieu was led into the\r\n   mistake of writing that Bābur gave Ḥusain the wrong pen-name,\r\n   _i.e._ Ḥusain, and not Ḥusainī (Turk. Cat. p. 256).\r\n\r\n   [1000] Daulat-shāh says that as he is not able to enumerate\r\n   all Ḥusain's feats-of-arms, he, Turkmān fashion, offers a gift\r\n   of Nine. The Nine differ from those of Bābur's list in some\r\n   dates; they are also records of victory only (Browne, p. 521;\r\n   _Not. et Extr._ iv, 262, de Saçy's article).\r\n\r\n   [1001] Wolves'-water, a river and its town at the s.e. corner\r\n   of the Caspian, the ancient boundary between Russia and\r\n   Persia.

The weight seems likely to refer to the\r\n   strength demanded for rounding the bow (_kamān guroha-sī_)\r\n   _i.e._ as much strength as to lift 40 _bātmāns_. Rounding or\r\n   bending might stand for stringing or drawing. The meaning can\r\n   hardly be one of the weight of the cross-bow itself. Erskine\r\n   read _gūrdehieh_ for _guroha_ (p. 180) and translated by\r\n   \"double-stringed bow\"; de Courteille (i, 373) read\r\n   _guirdhiyeh, arrondi, circulaire_, in this following Ilminsky\r\n   who may have followed Erskine. The Elph. and Ḥai. MSS. and the\r\n   first W.-i-B. (I.O. 215 f. 113b) have _kamān guroha-sī_; the\r\n   second W.-i-B. omits the passage, in the MSS. I have seen.\r\n\r\n   [1020] _yakhshīlār bārīb tūr_; lit. good things went (on); cf.\r\n   f. 156b and note.\r\n\r\n   [1021] Badī`u'z-zamān's son, drowned at Chausa in 946 AH.\r\n   (1539 AD.) A.N. (H. Beveridge, i, 344).\r\n\r\n   [1022] Qalāt-i-nādirī, in Khurāsān, the birth-place of Nādir\r\n   Shāh (T.R. p. 209).\r\n\r\n   [1023] _bīr gīna qīz_, which on f. 86b can fitly be read to\r\n   mean daughterling, _Töchterchen, fillette_, but here and\r\n   _i.a._ f. 168, must have another meaning than diminutive and\r\n   may be an equivalent of German _Stück_ and mean _one only_.\r\n   Gul-badan gives an account of Shād's manly pursuits (H.N. f.\r\n   25b).\r\n\r\n   [1024] He was the son of Mahdī Sl. (f. 320b) and the father of\r\n   `Āqil Sl. _Aūzbeg_ (A.N. index _s.n._). Several matters\r\n   suggest that these men were of the Shabān Aūzbegs who\r\n   intermarried with Ḥusain _Bāī-qarā's_ family and some of whom\r\n   went to Bābur in Hindūstān. One such matter is that Kābul was\r\n   the refuge of dispossessed Harātīs, after the Aūzbeg conquest;\r\n   that there `Āqil married Shād _Bāī-qarā_ and that `Ādil went\r\n   on to Bābur. Moreover Khāfī Khān makes a statement which (if\r\n   correct) would allow `Ādil's father Mahdī to be a grandson of\r\n   Ḥusain _Bāī-qarā_; this statement is that when Bābur defeated\r\n   the Aūzbegs in 916 AH. (1510 AD.), he freed from their\r\n   captivity two sons (descendants) of his paternal uncle, named\r\n   Mahdī Sl. and Sulṯān Mīrzā. [Leaving the authenticity of the\r\n   statement aside for a moment, it will be observed that this\r\n   incident is of the same date and place as another well-vouched\r\n   for, namely that Bābur then and there killed Mahdī Sl.\r\n   _Aūzbeg_ and Ḥamza Sl. _Aūzbeg_ after defeating them.] What\r\n   makes in favour of Khāfī Khān's correctness is, not only that\r\n   Bābur's foe Mahdī is not known to have had a son `Ādil, but\r\n   also that his \"Sulṯān Mīrzā\" is not a style so certainly\r\n   suiting Ḥamza as it does a Shabān sulṯān, one whose father was\r\n   a Shabān sulṯān, and whose mother was a Mīrzā's daughter.\r\n   Moreover this point of identification is pressed by the\r\n   correctness, according to oriental statement of relationship,\r\n   of Khāfī Khān's \"paternal uncle\" (of Bābur), because this\r\n   precisely suits Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā with whose family these\r\n   Shabān sulṯāns allied themselves. On the other hand it must be\r\n   said that Khāfī Khān's statement is not in the English text of\r\n   the _Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_, the book on which he mostly relies at\r\n   this period, nor is it in my husband's MS. [a copy from the\r\n   Rampūr Codex]; and to this must be added the verbal objection\r\n   that a modicum of rhetoric allows a death to be described both\r\n   in Turkī and Persian, as a release from the captivity of a\r\n   sinner's own acts (f. 160). Still Khāfī Khān may be right; his\r\n   statement may yet be found in some other MS. of the T. R. or\r\n   some different source; it is one a scribe copying the T. R.\r\n   might be led to omit by reason of its coincidences. The\r\n   killing and the release may both be right; `Ādil's Mahdī may\r\n   be the Shabān sulṯān inference makes him seem. This little\r\n   _crux_ presses home the need of much attention to the\r\n   _lacunae_ in the _Bābur-nāma_, since in them are lost some\r\n   exits and some entries of Bābur's _dramatis personae_,\r\n   pertinently, mention of the death of Mahdī with Ḥamza in 916\r\n   AH., and possibly also that of `Ādil's Mahdī's release.\r\n\r\n   [1025] A _chār-ṯāq_ may be a large tent rising into four domes\r\n   or having four porches.\r\n\r\n   [1026] Ḥ.S. iii, 367.\r\n\r\n   [1027] This phrase, common but not always selected, suggests\r\n   unwillingness to leave the paternal roof.\r\n\r\n   [1028] Abū'l-ghāzī's _History of the Mughūls_, Désmaisons, p.\r\n   207.\r\n\r\n   [1029] The appointment was made in 933 AH. (1527 AD.) and\r\n   seems to have been held still in 934 AH. (ff. 329, 332).\r\n\r\n   [1030] This grandson may have been a child travelling with his\r\n   father's household, perhaps Aūlūgh Mīrzā, the oldest son of\r\n   Muḥammad Sulṯān Mīrzā (A. A. Blochmann, p. 461). No mention is\r\n   made here of Sulṯānīm Begīm's marriage with `Abdu'l-bāqī Mīrzā\r\n   (f. 175).\r\n\r\n   [1031] Abū'l-qāsim Bābur _Shāhrukhī_ presumably.\r\n\r\n   [1032] The time may have been 902 AH. when Mas`ūd took his\r\n   sister Bega Begīm to Herī for her marriage with Ḥaidar (Ḥ.S.\r\n   iii, 260).\r\n\r\n   [1033] Khwāja Aḥmad _Yāsawī_, known as Khwāja Ātā, founder of\r\n   the Yāsawī religious order.\r\n\r\n   [1034] Not finding mention of a daughter of Abū-sa`id named\r\n   Rābī`a-sulṯān, I think she may be the daughter styled Āq Begīm\r\n   who is No. 3 in Gul-badan's guest-list for the Mystic Feast.\r\n\r\n   [1035] This man I take to be Ḥusain's grandfather and not\r\n   brother, both because `Abdu'l-lāh was of Ḥusain's and his\r\n   brother's generation, and also because of the absence here of\r\n   Bābur's usual defining words \"elder brother\" (of Sl. Ḥusain\r\n   Mīrzā). In this I have to differ from Dr. Rieu (Pers. Cat. p.\r\n   152).\r\n\r\n   [1036] So-named after his ancestor Sayyid Barka whose body was\r\n   exhumed from Andikhūd for reburial in Samarkand, by Tīmūr's\r\n   wish and there laid in such a position that Tīmūr's body was\r\n   at its feet (_Z̤afar-nāma_ ii, 719; Ḥ.S. iii, 82). (For the\r\n   above interesting detail I am indebted to my husband.)\r\n\r\n   [1037] _Qīzīl-bāsh_, Persians wearing red badges or caps to\r\n   distinguish them as Persians.\r\n\r\n   [1038] Yādgār-i-farrukh _Mīrān-shāhī_ (Ḥ.S. iii, 327). He may\r\n   have been one of those Mīrān-shāhīs of `Irāq from whom came\r\n   Ākā's and Sulṯānīm's husbands, Aḥmad and `Abdu'l-bāqī (ff.\r\n   164, 175_b_).\r\n\r\n   [1039] This should be four (f. 169_b_). The Ḥ.S. (iii, 327)\r\n   also names three only when giving Pāpā Āghācha's daughters\r\n   (the omission linking it with the B.N.), but elsewhere (iii,\r\n   229) it gives an account of a fourth girl's marriage; this\r\n   fourth is needed to make up the total of 11 daughters. Bābur's\r\n   and Khwānd-amīr's details of Pāpā Āghācha's quartette are\r\n   defective; the following may be a more correct list:—(1) Begīm\r\n   Sulṯān (a frequent title), married to Abā-bikr _Mīrān-shāhī_\r\n   (who died 884 AH.) and seeming too old to be the one [No. 3]\r\n   who married Mas`ūd (Ḥ.S. iii, 229); (2) Sulṯān-nizhād, married\r\n   to Iskandar _Bāī-qarā_; (3) Sa`ādat-bakht also known as Begīm\r\n   Sulṯān, married to Mas'ūd _Mīrān-shāhī_ (Ḥ.S. iii, 327); (4)\r\n   Manauwar-sulṯān, married to a son of Aūlūgh Beg _Kābulī_ (Ḥ.S.\r\n   iii, 327).\r\n\r\n   [1040] This \"after\" seems to contradict the statement (f. 58)\r\n   that Mas`ūd was made to kneel as a son-in-law (_kūyādlīk-kā\r\n   yūkūndūrūb_) at a date previous to his blinding, but the\r\n   seeming contradiction may be explained by considering the\r\n   following details; he left Herī hastily (f. 58), went to\r\n   Khusrau Shāh and was blinded by him,—all in the last two\r\n   months of 903 AH. (1498 AD.), after the kneeling on Ẕū'l-qa`da\r\n   3rd, (June 23rd) in the Ravens'-garden. Here what Bābur says\r\n   is that the Begīm was given (_bīrīb_) after the blinding, the\r\n   inference allowed being that though Mas`ūd had kneeled before\r\n   the blinding, she had remained in her father's house till his\r\n   return after the blinding.\r\n\r\n   [1041] The first W.-i-B. writes \"Apāq Begīm\" (I.O. 215 f. 136)\r\n   which would allow Sayyid Mīrzā to be a kinsman of Apāq Begīm,\r\n   wife of Ḥusain _Bāī-qarā_.\r\n\r\n   [1042] This brief summary conveys the impression that the\r\n   Begīm went on her pilgrimage shortly after Mas`ūd's death (913\r\n   AH. ?), but may be wrong:—After Mas`ūd's murder, by one Bīmāsh\r\n   Mīrzā, _dārogha_ of Sarakhs, at Shaibāq Khān's order, she was\r\n   married by Bīmāsh M. (Ḥ.S. iii, 278). How long after this she\r\n   went to Makka is not said; it was about 934 AH. when Bābur\r\n   heard of her as there.\r\n\r\n   [1043] This clause is in the Ḥai. MS. but not in the Elph. MS.\r\n   (f. 131), or Kehr's (Ilminsky, p. 210), or in either Persian\r\n   translation. The boy may have been 17 or 18.\r\n\r\n   [1044] This appears a mistake (f. 168 foot, and note on Pāpā's\r\n   daughters).\r\n\r\n   [1045] f. 171b.\r\n\r\n   [1046] 933 AH.-1527 AD. (f. 329).\r\n\r\n   [1047] Presumably this was a _yīnkālīk_ marriage; it differs\r\n   from some of those chronicled and also from a levirate\r\n   marriage in not being made with a childless wife. (Cf. index\r\n   _s.n._ _yīnkālīk_.)\r\n\r\n   [1048] Khwānd-amīr says that Bega Begīm was jealous, died of\r\n   grief at her divorce, and was buried in a College, of her own\r\n   erection, in 893 AH. (1488 AD. ḤS. iii, 245).\r\n\r\n   [1049] _Gulistān_ Cap. II, Story 31 (Platts, p. 114).\r\n\r\n   [1050] _i.e._ did not get ready to ride off if her husband\r\n   were beaten by her brother (f. 11 and note to Ḥabība).\r\n\r\n   [1051] Khadīja Begī Āghā (Ḥ.S. ii, 230 and iii, 327); she\r\n   would be promoted probably after Shāh-i-gharīb's birth.\r\n\r\n   [1052] He was a son of Badī`u'z-zamān.\r\n\r\n   [1053] It is singular that this honoured woman's parentage is\r\n   not mentioned; if it be right on f. 168b (_q.v._ with note) to\r\n   read Sayyid Mīrzā of Apāq Begīm, she may be a sayyida of\r\n   Andikhūd.\r\n\r\n   [1054] As Bābur left Kābul on Ṣafar 1st (Nov. 17th 1525 AD.),\r\n   the Begīm must have arrived in Muḥarram 932 AH. (Oct. 18th to\r\n   Nov. 17th).\r\n\r\n   [1055] f. 333. As Chandīrī was besieged in Rabī`u'l-ākhar 934\r\n   AH. this passage shews that, as a minimum estimate, what\r\n   remains of Bābur's composed narrative (_i.e._ down to f. 216b)\r\n   was written after that date (Jan. 1528).\r\n\r\n   [1056] _Chār-shambalār._ Mention of another inhabitant of this\r\n   place with the odd name, Wednesday (Chār-shamba), is made on\r\n   f. 42b.\r\n\r\n   [1057] Mole-marked Lady; most MSS. style her Bī but Ḥ.S. iii,\r\n   327, writes Bībī; it varies also by calling her a Turk. She\r\n   was a purchased slave of Shahr-bānū's and was given to the\r\n   Mīrzā by Shahr-bānū at the time of her own marriage with him.\r\n\r\n   [1058] As noted already, f. 168b enumerates three only.\r\n\r\n   [1059] The three were almost certainly Badī`u'z-zamān, Ḥaidar,\r\n   son of a Tīmūrid mother, and Muz̤affar-i-ḥusain, born after\r\n   his mother had been legally married.\r\n\r\n   [1060] Seven sons predeceased him:—Farrukh, Shāh-i-gharīb,\r\n   Muḥ. Ma`ṣūm, Ḥaidar, Ibrāhīm-i-ḥusain, Muḥ. Ḥusain and\r\n   Abū-turāb. So too five daughters:—Āq, Bega, Āghā, Kīchīk and\r\n   Fāṯima-sulṯān Begīms. So too four wives:—Bega-sulṯān and Chūlī\r\n   Begīms, Zubaida and Laṯīf-sulṯān Āghāchas (Ḥ.S. iii, 327).\r\n\r\n   [1061] Chākū, a Barlās, as was Tīmūr, was one of Tīmūr's noted\r\n   men.\r\n\r\n   At this point some hand not the scribe's has entered on the\r\n   margin of the Ḥai. MS. the descendants of Muḥ. Barandūq down\r\n   into Akbar's reign:—Muḥ. Farīdūn, bin Muḥ. Qulī Khān, bin\r\n   Mīrzā `Alī, bin Muḥ. Barandūq _Barlās_. Of these Farīdūn and\r\n   Muḥ. Qulī are amīrs of the _Āyīn-i-akbarī_ list (Blochmann,\r\n   pp. 341, 342; Ḥ.S. iii, 233).\r\n\r\n   [1062] Enforced marches of Mughūls and other nomads are\r\n   mentioned also on f. 154b and f. 155.\r\n\r\n   [1063] Ḥ.S. iii, 228, 233, 235.\r\n\r\n   [1064] _beg kīshī_, beg-person.\r\n\r\n   [1065] Khwānd-amīr says he died a natural death (Ḥ.S. iii,\r\n   235).\r\n\r\n   [1066] f. 21. For a fuller account of Nawā'i, _J. Asiatique_\r\n   xvii, 175, M. Belin's article.\r\n\r\n   [1067] _i.e._ when he was poor and a beg's dependant. He went\r\n   back to Herī at Sl. Ḥusain M.'s request in 873 AH.\r\n\r\n   [1068] Niẕāmī's (Rieu's Pers. Cat. s.n.).\r\n\r\n   [1069] Farīdu'd-dīn-`at̤t̤ar's (Rieu l.c. and Ency.

(Dec.\r\n   1500 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [1073] Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad bin Tawakkal _Barlās_ (Ḥ.S. iii,\r\n   229).\r\n\r\n   [1074] This may be that uncle of Tīmūr who made the Ḥaj (T. R.\r\n   p. 48, quoting the _Z̤afar-nāma_).\r\n\r\n   [1075] Some MSS. omit the word \"father\" here but to read it\r\n   obviates the difficulty of calling Walī a great beg of Sl.\r\n   Ḥusain Mīrzā although he died when that mīrzā took the throne\r\n   (973 AH.) and although no leading place is allotted to him in\r\n   Bābur's list of Herī begs. Here as in other parts of Bābur's\r\n   account of Herī, the texts vary much whether Turkī or Persian,\r\n   _e.g._ the Elph. MS. appears to call Walī a blockhead (_dūnkūz\r\n   dūr_), the Ḥai. MS. writing _n:kūz dūr_(?).\r\n\r\n   [1076] He had been Bābur _Shāhrukhī's yasāwal_\r\n   (Court-attendant), had fought against Ḥusain for\r\n   Yādgār-i-muḥammad and had given a daughter to Ḥusain (Ḥ.S.\r\n   iii, 206, 228, 230-32; D.S. in _Not. et Ex._ de Saçy p. 265).\r\n\r\n   [1077] f. 29b.\r\n\r\n   [1078] _Sic_, Elph. MS. and both Pers. trss. but the Ḥai. MS.\r\n   omits \"father\". To read it, however, suits the circumstance\r\n   that Ḥasan of Ya`qūb was not with Ḥusain and in Harāt but was\r\n   connected with Maḥmūd _Mīrānshāhī_ and Tīrmīẕ (f. 24). Nuyān\r\n   is not a personal name but is a title; it implies good-birth;\r\n   all uses of it I have seen are for members of the religious\r\n   family of Tīrmīẕ.\r\n\r\n   [1079] He was the son of Ibrāhīm _Barlās_ and a Badakhshī\r\n   begīm (T.R. p. 108).\r\n\r\n   [1080] He will have been therefore a collateral of Daulat-shāh\r\n   whose relation to Fīrūz-shāh is thus expressed by Nawā'i:—_Mīr\r\n   Daulat-shāh Fīrūz-shāh Beg-nīng `amm-zāda-sī Amīr\r\n   `Alā'u'd-daula Isfārayīnī-nīng aūghūlī dur_, _i.e._ Mīr\r\n   Daulat-shāh was the son of Fīrūz-shāh Beg's paternal uncle's\r\n   son, Amir `Alā'u'd-daula _Isfārayīnī_. Thus, Fīrūz-shāh and\r\n   Isfārayīnī were first cousins; Daulat-shāh and\r\n   `Abdu'l-khalīq's father were second cousins; while Daulat-shāh\r\n   and Fīrūz-shāh were first cousins, once removed (Rieu's Pers.\r\n   Cat. p. 534; Browne's D.S. English preface p. 14 and its\r\n   reference to the Pers. preface).\r\n\r\n   [1081] _Tarkhān-nāma_, E. & D.'s _History of India_ i, 303;\r\n   Ḥ.S. iii, 227.\r\n\r\n   [1082] f. 41 and note.\r\n\r\n   [1083] Both places are in the valley of the Herī-rūd.\r\n\r\n   [1084] Badī`u'z-zamān married a daughter of Ẕū'n-nūn; she died\r\n   in 911 AH. (E. & D. i, 305; Ḥ.S. iii, 324).\r\n\r\n   [1085] This indicates, both amongst Musalmāns and Hindūs,\r\n   obedience and submission. Several instances occur in\r\n   Macculloch's _Bengali Household Stories_.\r\n\r\n   [1086] T.R. p. 205.\r\n\r\n   [1087] This is an idiom expressive of great keenness\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1088] Ḥ.S. iii, 250, _kitābdār_, librarian; so too Ḥai. MS.\r\n   f. 174b.\r\n\r\n   [1089] _mutaiyam_ (f. 7b and note). Mīr Mughūl Beg was put to\r\n   death for treachery in `Irāq (Ḥ.S. iii, 227, 248).\r\n\r\n   [1090] Bābur speaks as an eye-witness (f. 187b). For a single\r\n   combat of Sayyid Badr, Ḥ. S. iii, 233.\r\n\r\n   [1091] f. 157 and note to _bātmān_.\r\n\r\n   [1092] A level field in which a gourd (_qabaq_) is set on a\r\n   pole for an archer's mark to be hit in passing at the gallop\r\n   (f. 18b and note).\r\n\r\n   [1093] Or possibly during the gallop the archer turned in the\r\n   saddle and shot backwards.\r\n\r\n   [1094] Junaid was the father of Niẕāmu'd-dīn `Alī, Bābur's\r\n   Khalīfa (Vice-gerent). That Khalīfa was of a religious house\r\n   on his mother's side may be inferred from his being styled\r\n   both Sayyid and Khwāja neither of which titles could have come\r\n   from his Turkī father. His mother may have been a sayyida of\r\n   one of the religious families of Marghīnān (f. 18 and note),\r\n   since Khalīfa's son Muḥibb-i-`alī writes his father's name\r\n   \"Niẕāmu'd-din `Alī _Marghīlānī_\" (_Marghīnānī_) in the Preface\r\n   of his _Book on Sport_ (Rieu's Pers. Cat. p. 485).\r\n\r\n   [1095] This northward migration would take the family into\r\n   touch with Bābur's in Samarkand and Farghāna.\r\n\r\n   [1096] He was left in charge of Jaunpūr in Rabī` I, 933 AH.\r\n   (Jan. 1527 AD.) but exchanged for Chunār in Ramẓān 935 AH.\r\n   (June 1529 AD.); so that for the writing of this part of the\r\n   _Bābur-nāma_ we have the major and minor limits of Jan. 1527\r\n   and June 1529.\r\n\r\n   [1097] Ḥ.S. iii, 227.\r\n\r\n   [1098] _See_ Appendix H, _On the counter-mark Bih-būd on\r\n   coins_.\r\n\r\n   [1099] Niẕāmu'd-dīn Amīr Shaikh Aḥmadu's-suhailī was surnamed\r\n   Suhailī through a _fāl_ (augury) taken by his spiritual guide,\r\n   Kamālu'd-dīn Ḥusain _Gāzur-gāhī_; it was he induced Ḥusain\r\n   _Kashīfī_ to produce his _Anwār-i-suhailī_ (Lights of Canopus)\r\n   (f. 125 and note; Rieu's Pers. Cat. p. 756; and for a couplet\r\n   of his, Ḥ.S. iii, 242 l. 10).\r\n\r\n   [1100] Index _s.n._\r\n\r\n   [1101] Did the change complete an analogy between `Alī\r\n   _Jalāīr_ and his (perhaps) elder son with `Alī Khalīfa and his\r\n   elder son Ḥasan?\r\n\r\n   [1102] The Qūsh-begī is, in Central Asia, a high official who\r\n   acts for an absent ruler (Shaw); he does not appear to be the\r\n   Falconer, for whom Bābur's name is Qūshchī (f. 15 n.).\r\n\r\n   [1103] He received this sobriquet because when he returned\r\n   from an embassy to the Persian Gulf, he brought, from Bahrein,\r\n   to his Tīmūrid master a gift of royal pearls (Sām Mīrzā). For\r\n   an account of Marwārīd _see_ Rieu's Pers. Cat. p. 1094 and\r\n   (_re_ portrait) p. 787.\r\n\r\n   [1104] Sām Mīrzā specifies this affliction as _ābla-i-farang_,\r\n   thus making what may be one of the earliest Oriental\r\n   references to _morbus gallicus_ [as de Saçy here translates\r\n   the name], the foreign or European pox, the \"French disease of\r\n   Shakespeare\" (H.B.).\r\n\r\n   [1105] Index _s.n._ Yūsuf.\r\n\r\n   [1106] Ramẓān 3rd 918 AH.-Nov. 12th 1512.\r\n\r\n   [1107] _i.e._ of the White-sheep Turkmāns.\r\n\r\n   [1108] His paternal line was, `Abdu'l-bāqī, son of `Us̤mān,\r\n   son of Sayyidī Aḥmad, son of Mīrān-shāh. His mother's people\r\n   were begs of the White-sheep (Ḥ.S. iii, 290).\r\n\r\n   [1109] Sulṯānīm had married Wais (f. 157) not later than 895\r\n   or 896 AH. (Ḥ. S. iii, 253); she married `Abdu'l-bāqī in 908\r\n   AH. (1502-3 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [1110] Sayyid Shamsu'd-dīn Muḥammad, Mīr Sayyid\r\n   _Sar-i-barahna_ owed his sobriquet of Bare-head to love-sick\r\n   wanderings of his youth (Ḥ.S. iii, 328). The Ḥ.S. it is clear,\r\n   recognizes him as a sayyid.\r\n\r\n   [1111] Rieu's Pers. Cat. p. 760; it is immensely long and\r\n   \"filled with tales that shock all probability\" (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1112] f. 94 and note. Sl. Ḥusain M. made him curator of\r\n   Anṣārī's shrine, an officer represented, presumably, by Col.\r\n   Yate's \"Mīr of Gāzur-gāh\", and he became Chief Justice in 904\r\n   AH. (1498-99 AD.). _See_ Ḥ.S. iii, 330 and 340; JASB 1887,\r\n   art. _On the city of Harāt_ (C. E. Yate) p. 85.\r\n\r\n   [1113] _mutasauwif_, perhaps meaning not a professed Ṣūfī.\r\n\r\n   [1114] He was of high birth on both sides, of religious houses\r\n   of T̤abas and Nishāpūr (D.S. pp. 161, 163).\r\n\r\n   [1115] In agreement with its preface, Dr. Rieu entered the\r\n   book as written by Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā; in his Addenda, however,\r\n   he quotes Bābur as the authority for its being by Gāzur-gāhī;\r\n   Khwānd-amīr's authority can be added to Bābur's (Ḥ.S. 340;\r\n   Pers. Cat. pp. 351, 1085).\r\n\r\n   [1116] _Dīwān._ The Wazīr is a sort of Minister of Finance;\r\n   the Dīwān is the office of revenue receipts and issues\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1117] a secretary who writes out royal orders (Ḥ.S. iii,\r\n   244).\r\n\r\n   [1118] Count von Noer's words about a cognate reform of later\r\n   date suit this man's work, it also was \"a bar to the\r\n   defraudment of the Crown, a stumbling-block in the path of\r\n   avaricious chiefs\" (_Emperor Akbar_ trs. i, 11). The\r\n   opposition made by `Alī-sher to reform so clearly to Ḥusain's\r\n   gain and to Ḥusain's begs' loss, stirs the question, \"What was\r\n   the source of his own income?\" Up to 873 AH. he was for some\r\n   years the dependant of Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg; he took nothing from\r\n   the Mīrzā, but gave to him; he must have spent much in\r\n   benefactions. The question may have presented itself to M.\r\n   Belin for he observes, \"`Alī-sher qui sans doute, à son retour\r\n   de l'exil, recouvra l'héritage de ses pères, et depuis occupa\r\n   de hautes positions dans le gouvernement de son pays, avait\r\n   acquis une grande fortune\" (_J. Asiatique_ xvii, 227). While\r\n   not contradicting M. Belin's view that vested property such as\r\n   can be described as \"paternal inheritance\", may have passed\r\n   from father to son, even in those days of fugitive prosperity\r\n   and changing appointments, one cannot but infer, from Nawā'i's\r\n   opposition to Majdu'd-dīn, that he, like the rest, took a\r\n   partial view of the \"rights\" of the cultivator.\r\n\r\n   [1119] This was in 903 AH. after some 20 years of service\r\n   (Ḥ.S. iii, 231; Ethé I.O. Cat. p. 252).\r\n\r\n   [1120] Amīr Jamālu'd-dīn `Atā'u'l-lāh, known also as\r\n   Jamālu'd-dīn Ḥusain, wrote a _History of Muhammad_ (Ḥ.S. iii,\r\n   345; Rieu's Pers. Cat. p. 147 & (a correction) p. 1081).\r\n\r\n   [1121] Amongst noticeable omissions from Bābur's list of Herī\r\n   celebrities are Mīr Khwānd Shāh (\"Mirkhond\"), his grandson\r\n   Khwānd-amīr, Ḥusain _Kashifī_ and Muinu'd-dīn al Zamjī, author\r\n   of a _History of Harāt_ which was finished in 897 AH.\r\n\r\n   [1122] Sa'du`d-dīn Mas`ūd, son of `Umar, was a native of Taft\r\n   in Yazd, whence his cognomen (Bahār-i-`ajam); he died in 792\r\n   AH.-1390 AD. (Ḥ.S. iii, 59, 343; T.R. p. 236; Rieu's Pers.\r\n   Cat. pp. 352, 453).\r\n\r\n   [1123] These are those connected with grammar and rhetoric\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1124] This is one of the four principal sects of\r\n   Muḥammadanism (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1125] T.R. p. 235, for Shāh Ismā`īl's murders in Herī.\r\n\r\n   [1126] Superintendent of Police, who examines weights,\r\n   measures and provisions, also prevents gambling, drinking and\r\n   so on.\r\n\r\n   [1127] f. 137.\r\n\r\n   [1128] The rank of Mujtahid, which is not bestowed by any\r\n   individual or class of men but which is the result of slow and\r\n   imperceptible opinion, finally prevailing and universally\r\n   acknowledged, is one of the greatest peculiarities of the\r\n   religion of Persia. The Mujtahid is supposed to be elevated\r\n   above human fears and human enjoyments, and to have a certain\r\n   degree of infallibility and inspiration. He is consulted with\r\n   reverence and awe. There is not always a Mujtahid necessarily\r\n   existing. _See_ Kaempfer, _Amoenitates Exoticae_ (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1129] _muḥaddas̤_, one versed in the traditional sayings and\r\n   actions of Muḥammad.\r\n\r\n   [1130] Ḥ.S. iii, 340.\r\n\r\n   [1131] B.M.

The Commentary\r\n   was made in order to explain the _Nafaḥāt_ to Jāmī's son.\r\n\r\n   [1132] He was buried by the Mullā's side.\r\n\r\n   [1133] Amīr Burhānu'd-dīn `Atā'u'l-lāh bin Maḥmūdu'l-ḥusainī\r\n   was born in Nishāpūr but known as Mashhadī because he retired\r\n   to that holy spot after becoming blind.\r\n\r\n   [1134] f. 144_b_ and note. Qāẓī Ikhtiyāru'd-dīn Ḥasan (Ḥ.S.\r\n   iii, 347) appears to be the Khwāja Ikhtiyār of the\r\n   _Āyīn-i-akbarī_, and, if so, will have taken professional\r\n   interest in the script, since Abū'l-faẓl describes him as a\r\n   distinguished calligrapher in Sl. Ḥusain M.'s presence\r\n   (Blochmann, p. 101).\r\n\r\n   [1135] Saifu'd-dīn (Sword of the Faith) Aḥmad, presumably.\r\n\r\n   [1136] A sister of his, Apāq Bega, the wife of `Alī-sher's\r\n   brother Darwīsh-i-`alī _kitābdār_, is included as a poet in\r\n   the _Biography of Ladies_ (Sprenger's Cat. p. 11). Amongst the\r\n   20 women named one is a wife of Shaibāq Khān, another a\r\n   daughter of Hilālī.\r\n\r\n   [1137] He was the son of Khw. Ni`amatu'l-lāh, one of Sl.\r\n   Abū-sa`īd M.'s wazīrs. When dying _aet._ 70 (923 AH.), he made\r\n   this chronogram on his own death, \"With 70 steps he measured\r\n   the road to eternity.\" The name Āsaf, so frequent amongst\r\n   wazīrs, is that of Solomon's wazīr.\r\n\r\n   [1138] Other interpretations are open; _wādī_, taken as\r\n   _river_, might refer to the going on from one poem to another,\r\n   the stream of verse; or it might be taken as _desert_, with\r\n   disparagement of collections.\r\n\r\n   [1139] Maulānā Jamālu'd-dīn _Banā'i_ was the son of a\r\n   _sabz-banā_, an architect, a good builder.\r\n\r\n   [1140] Steingass's Dictionary allows convenient reference for\r\n   examples of metres.\r\n\r\n   [1141] Other jokes made by _Banā'i_ at the expense of Nawā'i\r\n   are recorded in the various sources.\r\n\r\n   [1142] Bābur saw Banā'i in Samarkand at the end of 901 AH.\r\n   (1496 AD. f. 38).\r\n\r\n   Here Dr. Leyden's translation ends; one other fragment which\r\n   he translated will be found under the year 925 AH. (Erskine).\r\n   This statement allows attention to be drawn to the inequality\r\n   of the shares of the work done for the Memoirs of 1826 by\r\n   Leyden and by Erskine. It is just to Mr. Erskine, but a\r\n   justice he did not claim, to point out that Dr. Leyden's share\r\n   is slight both in amount and in quality; his essential\r\n   contribution was the initial stimulus he gave to the great\r\n   labours of his collaborator.\r\n\r\n   [1143] So of Lope de Vega (b. 1562; d. 1635 AD.), \"It became a\r\n   common proverb to praise a good thing by calling it _a Lope_,\r\n   so that jewels, diamonds, pictures, _etc._ were raised into\r\n   esteem by calling them his\" (Montalvan in Ticknor's _Spanish\r\n   Literature_ ii, 270).\r\n\r\n   [1144] Maulānā Saifī, known as 'Arūẓī from his mastery in\r\n   prosody (Rieu's Pers.

The B.M. and\r\n   I.O. have several of his books.\r\n\r\n   [1149] _Khamsatīn._ Hātifī regarded himself as the successor\r\n   of Niẕāmī and Khusrau; this, taken with Bābur's use of the\r\n   word _Khamsatīn_ on f. 7 and here, and Saifī's just above,\r\n   leads to the opinion that the _Khamsatīn_ of the _Bābur-nāma_\r\n   are always those of Niẕāmī and Khusrau, _the_ Two Quintets\r\n   (Rieu's Pers. Cat. p. 653).\r\n\r\n   [1150] Maulānā Mīr Kamālu'd-dīn Ḥusain of Nishāpūr (Rieu l.c.\r\n   index s.n.; Ethé's I.O. Cat. pp. 433 and 1134).\r\n\r\n   [1151] One of his couplets on good and bad fortune is\r\n   striking; \"The fortune of men is like a sand-glass; one hour\r\n   up, the next down.\" _See_ D'Herbélot in his article (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1152] Ḥ.S. iii, 336; Rieu's Pers. Cat. p. 1089.\r\n\r\n   [1153] Āhī (sighing) was with Shāh-i-gharīb before\r\n   Ibn-i-ḥusain and to him dedicated his _dīwān_. The words\r\n   _sāḥib-i-dīwān_ seem likely to be used here with double\r\n   meaning _i.e._ to express authorship and finance office.\r\n   Though Bābur has made frequent mention of authorship of a\r\n   _dīwān_ and of office in the _Dīwān_, he has not used these\r\n   words hitherto in either sense; there may be a play of words\r\n   here.\r\n\r\n   [1154] Muḥammad _Ṣāliḥ_ Mīrzā _Khwārizmī_, author of the\r\n   _Shaibānī-nāma_ which manifestly is the poem (_mas̤nawī_)\r\n   mentioned below. This has been published with a German\r\n   translation by Professor Vambéry and has been edited with\r\n   Russian notes by Mr. Platon Melioransky (Rieu's Turkish Cat.\r\n   p. 74; Ḥ.S. iii, 301).\r\n\r\n   [1155] Jāmī's _Subḥatu'l-abrār_ (Rosary of the righteous).\r\n\r\n   [1156] The reference may be to things said by Muḥ. _Ṣāliḥ_ the\r\n   untruth of which was known to Bābur through his own part in\r\n   the events. A crying instance of misrepresentation is Ṣāliḥ's\r\n   assertion, in rhetorical phrase, that Bābur took booty in\r\n   jewels from Khusrau Shāh; other instances concern the affairs\r\n   of The Khāns and of Bābur in Transoxiana (f. 124b and index\r\n   _s.nn._ Aḥmad and Maḥmūd _Chaghatāī_ _etc._; T.R. index\r\n   _s.nn._)\r\n\r\n   [1157] The name Fat-land (Taṃbal-khāna) has its parallel in\r\n   Fat-village (Sīmīz-kīnt) a name of Samarkand; in both cases\r\n   the nick-name is accounted for by the fertility of irrigated\r\n   lands. We have not been able to find the above-quoted couplet\r\n   in the _Shaibānī-nāma_ (Vambéry); needless to say, the pun is\r\n   on the nick-name (_taṃbal_, fat) of Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_.\r\n\r\n   [1158] Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ does not show well in his book; he is\r\n   sometimes coarse, gloats over spoil whether in human captives\r\n   or goods, and, his good-birth not-forbidding, is a servile\r\n   flatterer. Bābur's word \"heartless\" is just; it must have had\r\n   sharp prompting from Ṣāliḥ's rejoicing in the downfall of The\r\n   Khāns, Bābur's uncles.\r\n\r\n   [1159] the Longer (Ḥ.S. iii, 349).\r\n\r\n   [1160] Maulānā Badru'd-dīn (Full-moon of the Faith) whose\r\n   pen-name was Hilālī, was of Astarābād. It may be noted that\r\n   two dates of his death are found, 936 and 939 AH. the first\r\n   given by de Saçy, the second by Rieu, and that the second\r\n   seems to be correct (_Not. et Extr._ p. 285; Pers. Cat. p.\r\n   656; Hammer's _Geschichte_ p. 368).\r\n\r\n   [1161] B.M. Add. 7783.\r\n\r\n   [1162] Opinions differ as to the character of this\r\n   work:—Bābur's is uncompromising; von Hammer (p. 369) describes\r\n   it as \"_ein romantisches Gedicht, welches eine sentimentale\r\n   Männerliebe behandelt_\"; Sprenger (p. 427), as a mystical\r\n   _mas̤nawī_ (poem); Rieu finds no spiritual symbolism in it and\r\n   condemns it (Pers. Cat. p. 656 and, quoting the above passage\r\n   of Bābur, p. 1090); Ethé, who has translated it, takes it to\r\n   be mystical and symbolic (I.O. Cat. p. 783).\r\n\r\n   [1163] Of four writers using the pen-name Ahlī\r\n   (Of-the-people), _viz._ those of Turān, Shīrāz, Tarshīz (in\r\n   Khurāsān), and 'Irāq, the one noticed here seems to be he of\r\n   Tarshīz. Ahlī of Tarshīz was the son of a locally-known pious\r\n   father and became a Superintendent of the Mint; Bābur's `_āmī_\r\n   may refer to Ahlī's first patrons, tanners and shoe-makers by\r\n   writing for whom he earned his living (Sprenger, p. 319).\r\n   Erskine read _'ummī_, meaning that Ahlī could neither read nor\r\n   write; de Courteille that he was _un homme du commun_.\r\n\r\n   [1164] He was an occasional poet (Ḥ.S. iii, 350 and iv, 118;\r\n   Rieu's Pers. Cat. p. 531; Ethé's I.O. Cat. p. 428).\r\n\r\n   [1165] Ustād Kamālu'd-dīn Bih-zād (well-born; Ḥ.S. iii, 350).\r\n   Work of his is reproduced in Dr. Martin's _Painting and\r\n   Painters of Persia_ of 1913 AD.\r\n\r\n   [1166] This sentence is not in the Elph. MS.\r\n\r\n   [1167] Perhaps he could reproduce tunes heard and say where\r\n   heard.\r\n\r\n   [1168] M. Belin quotes quatrains exchanged by `Alī-sher and\r\n   this man (_J. Asiatique_ xvii, 199).\r\n\r\n   [1169] _i.e._ from his own camp to Bābā Ilāhī.\r\n\r\n   [1170] f. 121 has a fuller quotation. On the dual succession,\r\n   _see_ T.R. p. 196.\r\n\r\n   [1171] Elph. MS. f. 144; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 148_b_ and 217 f.\r\n   125_b_; Mems. p. 199.\r\n\r\n   [1172] News of Ḥusain's death in 911 AH. (f. 163b) did not\r\n   reach Bābur till 912 AH. (f. 184_b_).\r\n\r\n   [1173] Lone-meadow (f. 195_b_). Jahāngīr will have come over\r\n   the `Irāq-pass, Bābur's baggage-convoy, by Shibr-tū. Cf. T. R.\r\n   p. 199 for Bābur and Jahāngīr at this time.\r\n\r\n   [1174] Servant-of-the-mace; but perhaps, Qilinj-chāq,\r\n   swords-man.\r\n\r\n   [1175] One of four, a fourth. Chār-yak may be a component of\r\n   the name of the well-known place, n. of Kābul, \"Chārikār\"; but\r\n   also the _Chār_ in it may be Hindūstānī and refer to the\r\n   permits-to-pass after tolls paid, given to caravans halted\r\n   there for taxation. Raverty writes it Chārlākār.\r\n\r\n   [1176] Amongst the disruptions of the time was that of the\r\n   Khānate of Qībchāq (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1177] The nearest approach to _kipkī_ we have found in\r\n   Dictionaries is _kupaki_, which comes close to the Russian\r\n   _copeck_. Erskine notes that the _casbeké_ is an oval copper\r\n   coin (Tavernier, p. 121); and that a _tūmān_ is a myriad\r\n   (10,000). _Cf._ Manucci (Irvine), i, 78 and iv, 417 note;\r\n   Chardin iv, 278.\r\n\r\n   [1178] Muḥarram 912 AH.-June 1506 AD. (Ḥ.S. iii, 353).\r\n\r\n   [1179] I take Murgh-āb here to be the fortified place at the\r\n   crossing of the river by the main n.e. road; Bābur when in\r\n   Dara-i-bām was on a tributary of the Murgh-āb. Khwānd-amīr\r\n   records that the information of his approach was hailed in the\r\n   Mīrzās' camp as good news (Ḥ.S. iii, 354).\r\n\r\n   [1180] Bābur gives the Mīrzās precedence by age, ignoring\r\n   Muz̤affar's position as joint-ruler.\r\n\r\n   [1181] _mubālgha qīldī_; perhaps he laid stress on their\r\n   excuse; perhaps did more than was ceremonially incumbent on\r\n   him.\r\n\r\n   [1182] _`irq_, to which estrade answers in its sense of a\r\n   carpet on which stands a raised seat.\r\n\r\n   [1183] Perhaps it was a recess, resembling a gate-way (W.-i-B.\r\n   I.O. 215 f. 151 and 217 f. 127_b_). The impression conveyed by\r\n   Bābur's words here to the artist who in B.M. Or. 3714, has\r\n   depicted the scene, is that there was a vestibule opening into\r\n   the tent by a door and that the Mīrzā sat near that door. It\r\n   must be said however that the illustration does not closely\r\n   follow the text, in some known details.\r\n\r\n   [1184] _shīra_, fruit-syrups, sherbets. Bābur's word for wine\r\n   is _chāghīr_ (_q.v._ index) and this reception being public,\r\n   wine could hardly have been offered in Sunnī Herī. Bābur's\r\n   strictures can apply to the vessels of precious metal he\r\n   mentions, these being forbidden to Musalmāns; from his\r\n   reference to the Tūra it would appear to repeat the same\r\n   injunctions. Bābur broke up such vessels before the battle of\r\n   Kanwāha (f. 315). Shāh-i-jahān did the same; when sent by his\r\n   father Jahāngīr to reconquer the Deccan (1030 AH.-1621 AD.) he\r\n   asked permission to follow the example of his ancestor Bābur,\r\n   renounced wine, poured his stock into the Chaṃbal, broke up\r\n   his cups and gave the fragments to the poor (_`Amal-i-ṣāliḥ_,\r\n   Hughes' _Dict. of Islām_ quoting the _Hidāyah_ and _Mishkāt_,\r\n   _s.nn._ Drinkables, Drinking-vessels, and Gold; Lane's _Modern\r\n   Egyptians_ p. 125 n.).\r\n\r\n   [1185] This may be the Rabāṯ-i-sanghī of some maps, on a near\r\n   road between the \"Forty-daughters\" and Harāt; or Bābur may\r\n   have gone out of his direct way to visit Rabāṯ-i-sang-bast, a\r\n   renowned halting place at the Carfax of the Herī-T̤ūs and\r\n   Nishāpūr-Mashhad roads, built by one Arslān _Jazāla_ who lies\r\n   buried near, and rebuilt with great magnificence by `Alī-sher\r\n   _Nawā'i_ (Daulat-shāh, Browne, p. 176).\r\n\r\n   [1186] The wording here is confusing to those lacking family\r\n   details. The paternal-aunt begīms can be Pāyanda-sulṯān\r\n   (named), Khadīja-sulṯān, Apāq-sulṯān, and Fakhr-jahān Begīms,\r\n   all daughters of Abū-sa`īd. The Apāq Begīm named above (also\r\n   on f. 168_b_ _q.v._) does not now seem to me to be Abū-sa`īd's\r\n   daughter (Gul-badan, trs. Bio. App.).\r\n\r\n   [1187] _yūkūnmāī._ Unless all copies I have seen reproduce a\r\n   primary clerical mistake of Bābur's, the change of salutation\r\n   indicated by there being no kneeling with Apāq Begīm, points\r\n   to a _nuance_ of etiquette. Of the verb _yūkūnmāk_ it may be\r\n   noted that it both describes the ceremonious attitude of\r\n   intercourse, _i.e._ kneeling and sitting back on both heels\r\n   (Shaw), and also the kneeling on meeting. From Bābur's phrase\r\n   _Begīm bīla yūkūnūb_ [having kneeled with], it appears that\r\n   each of those meeting made the genuflection; I have not found\r\n   the phrase used of other meetings; it is not the one used when\r\n   a junior or a man of less degree meets a senior or superior in\r\n   rank (_e.g._ Khusrau and Bābur f. 123, or Bābur and\r\n   Badī`u'z-zamān f. 186).\r\n\r\n   [1188] Musalmāns employ a set of readers who succeed one\r\n   another in reading (reciting) the Qorān at the tombs of their\r\n   men of eminence. This reading is sometimes continued day and\r\n   night. The readers are paid by the rent of lands or other\r\n   funds assigned for the purpose (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1189] A suspicion that Khadīja put poison in Jahāngīr's wine\r\n   may refer to this occasion (T.R. p. 199).\r\n\r\n   [1190] These are _jharokha-i-darsān_, windows or balconies\r\n   from which a ruler shews himself to the people.\r\n\r\n   [1191] Mas`ūd was then blind.\r\n\r\n   [1192] Bābur first drank wine not earlier than 917 AH. (f. 49\r\n   and note), therefore when nearing 30.\r\n\r\n   [1193] _aīchkīlār_, French, _intérieur_.\r\n\r\n   [1194] The obscure passage following here is discussed in\r\n   Appendix I, _On the weeping-willows of_ f. 190_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1195] Here this may well be a gold-embroidered garment.\r\n\r\n   [1196] This, the tomb of Khwāja `Abdu'l-lāh _Anṣari_ (d. 481\r\n   AH.) stands some 2m. north of Herī. Bābur mentions one of its\r\n   numerous attendants of his day, Kamālu'd-dīn Ḥusain\r\n   _Gāzur-gāhī_. Mohan Lall describes it as he saw it in 1831;\r\n   says the original name of the locality was Kār-zār-gāh,\r\n   place-of-battle; and, as perhaps his most interesting detail,\r\n   mentions that Jalālu'd-dīn _Rūmī's Maṣnawī_ was recited every\r\n   morning near the tomb and that people fainted during the\r\n   invocation (_Travels in the Panj-āb_ etc. p. 252). Colonel\r\n   Yate has described the tomb as he saw it some 50 years later\r\n   (JASB 1887); and explains the name Gāzur-gāh (lit.\r\n   bleaching-place) by the following words of an inscription\r\n   there found; \"His tomb (Anṣarī's) is a washing-place\r\n   (_gāzur-gāh_) wherein the cloud of the Divine forgiveness\r\n   washes white the black records of men\" (p. 88 and p. 102).\r\n\r\n   [1197] _juāz-i-kaghazlār_ (f. 47_b_ and note).\r\n\r\n   [1198] The _Ḥabību's-siyār_ and Ḥai. MS. write this name with\r\n   medial \"round _hā_\"; this allows it to be Kahad-stān, a\r\n   running-place, race-course. Khwānd-amīr and Daulat-shāh call\r\n   it a meadow (_aūlāng_); the latter speaks of a feast as held\r\n   there; it was Shaibānī's head-quarters when he took Harāt.\r\n\r\n   [1199] _var._ Khatīra; either an enclosure (_qūrūq_?) or a\r\n   fine and lofty building.\r\n\r\n   [1200] This may have been a usual halting-place on a journey\r\n   (_safar_) north. It was built by Ḥusain _Bāī-qarā_, overlooked\r\n   hills and fields covered with _arghwān_ (f. 137_b_) and seems\r\n   once to have been a Paradise (Mohan Lall, p. 256).\r\n\r\n   [1201] Jāmī's tomb was in the `Īd-gah of Herī (Ḥ.S. ii, 337),\r\n   which appears to be the Muṣalla (Praying-place) demolished by\r\n   Amīr `Abdu'r-raḥmān in the 19th century. Col. Yate was shewn a\r\n   tomb in the Muṣalla said to be Jāmī's and agreeing in the age,\r\n   81, given on it, with Jāmī's at death, but he found a _crux_\r\n   in the inscription (pp. 99, 106).\r\n\r\n   [1202] This may be the Muṣalla (Yate, p. 98).\r\n\r\n   [1203] This place is located by the Ḥ.S. at 5 _farsakh_ from\r\n   Herī (de Meynard at 25 _kilomètres_). It appears to be rather\r\n   an abyss or fissure than a pond, a crack from the sides of\r\n   which water trickles into a small bason in which dwells a\r\n   mysterious fish, the beholding of which allows the attainment\r\n   of desires. The story recalls Wordsworth's undying fish of\r\n   Bow-scale Tarn. (_Cf._ Ḥ.S. Bomb. ed. ii, _Khatmat_ p. 20 and\r\n   de Meynard, _Journal Asiatique_ xvi, 480 and note.)\r\n\r\n   [1204] This is on maps to the north of Herī.\r\n\r\n   [1205] d. 232 AH. (847 AD.). _See_ Yate, p. 93.\r\n\r\n   [1206] Imām Fakhru'd-dīn _Raẓī_ (de Meynard, _Journal\r\n   Asiatique_ xvi, 481).\r\n\r\n   [1207] d. 861 AH.-1457 AD. Guhār-shād was the wife of Tīmūr's\r\n   son Shāhrukh. _See_ Mohan Lall, p. 257 and Yate, p. 98.\r\n\r\n   [1208] This Marigold-garden may be named after\r\n   Hārūnu'r-rashīd's wife Zubaida.\r\n\r\n   [1209] This will be the place n. of Herī from which Maulānā\r\n   Jalālu'd-dīn _Pūrānī_ (d. 862 AH.) took his cognomen, as also\r\n   Shaikh Jamālu'd-dīn Abū-sa`īd _Pūrān_ (f. 206) who was visited\r\n   there by Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, ill-treated by Shaibānī (f. 206),\r\n   left Herī for Qandahār, and there died, through the fall of a\r\n   roof, in 921 AH. (Ḥ.S. iii, 345; _Khazīnatu'l-asfiya_ ii,\r\n   321).\r\n\r\n   [1210] His tomb is dated 35 or 37 AH. (656 or 658 AD.; Yate,\r\n   p. 94).\r\n\r\n   [1211] Mālān was a name of the Herī-rūd (_Journal Asiatique_\r\n   xvi, 476, 511; Mohan Lall, p. 279; Ferrier, p. 261; _etc._).\r\n\r\n   [1212] Yate, p. 94.\r\n\r\n   [1213] The position of this building between the Khūsh and\r\n   Qībchāq Gates (de Meynard, l.c. p. 475) is the probable\r\n   explanation of the variant, noted just below, of Kushk for\r\n   Khūsh as the name of the Gate. The _Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_ (p.\r\n   429), mentions this kiosk in its list of the noted ones of the\r\n   world.\r\n\r\n   [1214] var. Kushk (de Meynard, l.c. p. 472).\r\n\r\n   [1215] The reference here is, presumably, to Bābur's own\r\n   losses of Samarkand and Andijān.\r\n\r\n   [1216] Ākā or Āgā is used of elder relations; a _yīnkā_ or\r\n   _yīngā_ is the wife of an uncle or elder brother; here it\r\n   represents the widow of Bābur's uncle Aḥmad _Mīrān-shāhī_.\r\n   From it is formed the word _yīnkālīk_, levirate.\r\n\r\n   [1217] The almshouse or convent was founded here in Tīmūr's\r\n   reign (de Meynard, l.c. p. 500).\r\n\r\n   [1218] _i.e._ No smoke without fire.\r\n\r\n   [1219] This name may be due to the splashing of water. A\r\n   Langar which may be that of Mīr Ghiyās̤, is shewn in maps in\r\n   the Bām valley; from it into the Herī-rūd valley Bābur's route\r\n   may well have been the track from that Langar which, passing\r\n   the villages on the southern border of Gharjistān, goes to\r\n   Ahangarān.\r\n\r\n   [1220] This escape ought to have been included in the list of\r\n   Bābur's transportations from risk to safety given in my note\r\n   to f. 96.\r\n\r\n   [1221] The right and wrong roads are shewn by the Indian\r\n   Survey and French Military maps. The right road turns off from\r\n   the wrong one, at Daulat-yār, to the right, and mounts\r\n   diagonally along the south rampart of the Herī-rūd valley, to\r\n   the Zirrīn-pass, which lies above the Bakkak-pass and carries\r\n   the regular road for Yaka-aūlāng. It must be said, however,\r\n   that we are not told whether Yaka-aūlāng was Qāsim Beg's\r\n   objective; the direct road for Kābul from the Herī-rūd valley\r\n   is not over the Zirrīn-pass but goes from Daulat-yār by\r\n   \"Āq-zarat\", and the southern flank of Koh-i-bābā (bābār) to\r\n   the Unai-pass (Holdich's _Gates of India_ p. 262).\r\n\r\n   [1222] _circa_ Feb. 14th 1507, Bābur's 24th birthday.\r\n\r\n   [1223] The Hazāras appear to have been wintering outside their\r\n   own valley, on the Ghūr-bund road, in wait for travellers\r\n   [_cf._ T.R. p. 197]. They have been perennial highwaymen on\r\n   the only pass to the north not closed entirely in winter.\r\n\r\n   [1224] The Ghūr-bund valley is open in this part; the Hazāras\r\n   may have been posted on the naze near the narrows leading into\r\n   the Janglīk and their own side valleys.\r\n\r\n   [1225] Although the verses following here in the text are with\r\n   the Turkī Codices, doubt cannot but be felt as to their\r\n   authenticity. They do not fit verbally to the sentence they\r\n   follow; they are a unique departure from Bābur's plain prose\r\n   narrative and nothing in the small Hazāra affair shews cause\r\n   for such departure; they differ from his usual topics in their\r\n   bombast and comment on his men (_cf._ f. 194 for comment on\r\n   shirking begs). They appear in the 2nd Persian translation\r\n   (217 f. 134) in Turkī followed by a prose Persian rendering\r\n   (_khalāṣa_). They are not with the 1st Pers. trs. (215 f.\r\n   159), the text of which runs on with a plain prose account\r\n   suiting the size of the affair, as follows:—\"The braves,\r\n   seeing their (the Hazāras) good soldiering, had stopped\r\n   surprised; wishing to hurry them I went swiftly past them,\r\n   shouting 'Move on! move on!' They paid me no attention. When,\r\n   in order to help, I myself attacked, dismounting and going up\r\n   the hill, they shewed courage and emulation in following.\r\n   Getting to the top of the pass, we drove that band off,\r\n   killing many, capturing others, making their families prisoner\r\n   and plundering their goods.\" This is followed by \"I myself\r\n   collected\" _etc._ as in the Turkī text after the verse. It\r\n   will be seen that the above extract is not a translation of\r\n   the verse; no translator or even summariser would be likely to\r\n   omit so much of his original. It is just a suitably plain\r\n   account of a trivial matter.\r\n\r\n   [1226] _Gulistān_ Cap. I. Story 4.\r\n\r\n   [1227] Bābur seems to have left the Ghūr-bund valley, perhaps\r\n   pursuing the Hazāras towards Janglīk, and to have come \"by\r\n   ridge and valley\" back into it for Ushtur-shahr. I have not\r\n   located Tīmūr Beg's Langar. As has been noted already (_q.v._\r\n   index) the Ghūr-bund narrows are at the lower end of the\r\n   valley; they have been surmised to be the fissured rampart of\r\n   an ancient lake.\r\n\r\n   [1228] Here this may represent a guard- or toll-house (Index\r\n   _s.n._).\r\n\r\n   [1229] As _yūrūn_ is a patch, the bearer of the sobriquet\r\n   might be Black Aḥmad the repairing-tailor.\r\n\r\n   [1230] _Second Afghān War_, Map of Kābul and its environs.\r\n\r\n   [1231] I understand that the arrival undiscovered was a result\r\n   of riding in single-file and thus shewing no black mass.\r\n\r\n   [1232] or _gharbīcha_, which Mr. Erskine explains to be the\r\n   four plates of mail, made to cover the back, front and sides;\r\n   the _jība_ would thus be the wadded under-coat to which they\r\n   are attached.\r\n\r\n   [1233] This prayer is composed of extracts from the Qorān\r\n   (_Méms_, i, 454 note); it is reproduced as it stands in Mr.\r\n   Erskine's wording (p. 216).\r\n\r\n   [1234] Bābur's reference may well be to Sanjar's birth as well\r\n   as to his being the holder of Nīngnahār. Sanjar's father had\r\n   been thought worthy to mate with one of the six Badakhshī\r\n   begīms whose line traced back to Alexander (T. R. p. 107); and\r\n   his father was a Barlās, seemingly of high family.\r\n\r\n   [1235] It may be inferred that what was done was for the\r\n   protection of the two women.\r\n\r\n   [1236] Not a bad case could have been made out for now putting\r\n   a Tīmūrid in Bābur's place in Kābul; _viz._ that he was\r\n   believed captive in Herī and that Mīrzā Khān was an effective\r\n   _locum tenens_ against the Arghūns. Haidar sets down what in\r\n   his eyes pleaded excuse for his father Muḥ. Ḥusain (T.R. p.\r\n   198).\r\n\r\n   [1237] _qūsh_, not even a little plough-land being given\r\n   (_chand qulba dihya_, 215 f. 162).\r\n\r\n   [1238] They were sons of Sl. Aḥmad Khān _Chaghatāī_.\r\n\r\n   [1239] f. 160.\r\n\r\n   [1240] Ḥaidar's opinion of Bābur at this crisis is of the more\r\n   account that his own father was one of the rebels let go to\r\n   the mercy of the \"avenging servitor\". When he writes of Bābur,\r\n   as being, at a time so provoking, gay, generous, affectionate,\r\n   simple and gentle, he sets before us insight and temper in\r\n   tune with Kipling's \"If....\"\r\n\r\n   [1241] Bābur's distinction, made here and elsewhere, between\r\n   Chaghatāī and Mughūl touches the old topic of the right or\r\n   wrong of the term \"Mughūl dynasty\". What he, as also Ḥaidar,\r\n   allows said is that if Bābur were to describe his mother in\r\n   tribal terms, he would say she was half-Chaghatāī,\r\n   half-Mughūl; and that if he so described himself, he would say\r\n   he was half-Tīmūrid-Turk, half-Chaghatāī. He might have called\r\n   the dynasty he founded in India Turkī, might have called it\r\n   Tīmūriya; he would never have called it Mughūl, after his\r\n   maternal grandmother.\r\n\r\n   Ḥaidar, with imperfect classification, divides Chīngīz Khān's\r\n   \"Mughūl horde\" into Mughūls and Chaghatāīs and of this\r\n   Chaghatāī offtake says that none remained in 953 _AH._ (1547\r\n   _AD._) except the rulers, _i.e._ sons of Sl. Aḥmad Khan (T.R.\r\n   148). Manifestly there was a body of Chaghatāīs with Bābur and\r\n   there appear to have been many near his day in the Herī\r\n   region,—`Alī-sher _Nawā`i_ the best known.\r\n\r\n   Bābur supplies directions for naming his dynasty when, as\r\n   several times, he claims to rule in Hindūstān where the \"Turk\"\r\n   had ruled (f. 233_b_, f. 224_b_, f. 225). To call his dynasty\r\n   Mughūl seems to blot out the centuries, something as we should\r\n   do by calling the English Teutons. If there is to be such\r\n   blotting-out, Abū'l-ghāzī would allow us, by his tables of\r\n   Turk descent, to go further, to the primal source of all the\r\n   tribes concerned, to Turk, son of Japhet. This traditional\r\n   descent is another argument against \"Mughūl dynasty.\"\r\n\r\n   [1242] They went to Qandahār and there suffered great\r\n   privation.\r\n\r\n   [1243] Bārān seems likely to be the Baian of some maps.\r\n   Gul-i-bahār is higher up on the Panjhīr road. Chāsh-tūpa will\r\n   have been near-by; its name might mean _Hill of the heap of\r\n   winnowed-corn_.\r\n\r\n   [1244] f. 136.\r\n\r\n   [1245] Answer; Visions of his father's sway.\r\n\r\n   [1246] Elph. MS. f. 161; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 164 and 217 f.\r\n   139_b_; Mems. p. 220.\r\n\r\n   [1247] The narrative indicates the location of the tribe, the\r\n   modern Ghilzāī or Ghilzī.\r\n\r\n   [1248] Sih-kāna lies s.e. of Shorkach, and near Kharbīn.\r\n   Sar-i-dih is about 25 or 30 miles s. of Ghaznī (Erskine). A\r\n   name suiting the pastoral wealth of the tribe _viz._\r\n   Mesh-khail, Sheep-tribe, is shewn on maps somewhat s. from\r\n   Kharbīn. _Cf._ Steingass _s.n._ Masht.\r\n\r\n   [1249] _yāghrūn_, whence _yāghrūnchī_, a diviner by help of\r\n   the shoulder-blades of sheep. The defacer of the Elphinstone\r\n   Codex has changed _yāghrūn_ to _yān_, side, thus making Bābur\r\n   turn his side and not his half-back to the north, altering his\r\n   direction, and missing what looks like a jesting reference to\r\n   his own divination of the road. The Pole Star was seen,\r\n   presumably, before the night became quite black.\r\n\r\n   [1250] From the subsequent details of distance done, this must\r\n   have been one of those good _yīghāch_ of perhaps 5-6 miles,\r\n   that are estimated by the ease of travel on level lands (Index\r\n   _s.v._ _yīghāch_).\r\n\r\n   [1251] I am uncertain about the form of the word translated by\r\n   \"whim\". The Elph. and Ḥai. Codices read _khūd d:lma_ (altered\r\n   in the first to _y:lma_); Ilminsky (p. 257) reads _khūd l:ma_\r\n   (de C. ii, 2 and note); Erskine has been misled by the Persian\r\n   translation (215 f. 164_b_ and 217 f. 139_b_). Whether\r\n   _khūd-dilma_ should be read, with the sense of \"out of their\r\n   own hearts\" (spontaneously), or whether _khūd-yalma_, own pace\r\n   (Turkī, _yalma_, pace) the contrast made by Bābur appears to\r\n   be between an unpremeditated gallop and one premeditated for\r\n   haste. Persian _dalama_, tarantula, also suggests itself.\r\n\r\n   [1252] _chāpqūn_, which is the word translated by gallop\r\n   throughout the previous passage. The Turkī verb _chāpmāq_ is\r\n   one of those words-of-all-work for which it is difficult to\r\n   find a single English equivalent. The verb _qūīmāq_ is\r\n   another; in its two occurrences here the first may be a\r\n   metaphor from the pouring of molten metal; the second\r\n   expresses that permission to gallop off for the raid without\r\n   which to raid was forbidden. The root-notion of _qūīmāq_ seems\r\n   to be letting-go, that of _chāpmāq_, rapid motion.\r\n\r\n   [1253] _i.e._ on the raiders' own road for Kābul.\r\n\r\n   [1254] f. 198_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1255] The Fifth taken was manifestly at the ruler's\r\n   disposition. In at least two places when dependants send gifts\r\n   to Bābur the word [_tassaduq_] used might be rendered as\r\n   \"gifts for the poor\". Does this mean that the _pādshāh_ in\r\n   receiving this stands in the place of the Imām of the Qorān\r\n   injunction which orders one-fifth of spoil to be given to the\r\n   Imām for the poor, orphans, and travellers,—four-fifths being\r\n   reserved for the troops? (Qorān, Sale's ed. 1825, i, 212 and\r\n   Hidāyat, Book ix).\r\n\r\n   [1256] This may be the sum of the separate items of sheep\r\n   entered in account-books by the commissaries.\r\n\r\n   [1257] Here this comprehensive word will stand for deer, these\r\n   being plentiful in the region.\r\n\r\n   [1258] Three Turkī MSS. write _ṣīghīnīb_, but the Elph. MS.\r\n   has had this changed to _yītīb_, having reached.\r\n\r\n   [1259] _bāsh-sīz_, lit. without head, doubtless a pun on\r\n   Aūz-beg (own beg, leaderless). B.M. Or. 3714 shows an artist's\r\n   conception of this _tart-part_.\r\n\r\n   [1260] Bābā Khākī is a fine valley, some 13 _yīghāch_ e. of\r\n   Herī (f. 13) where the Herī sulṯāns reside in the heats (_J.\r\n   Asiatique_ xvi, 501, de Meynard's article; Ḥ.S. iii, 356).\r\n\r\n   [1261] f. 172_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1262] _aūkhshātā almādī._ This is one of many passages which\r\n   Ilminsky indicates he has made good by help of the Memoirs (p.\r\n   261; _Mémoires_ ii, 6).\r\n\r\n   [1263] They are given also on f. 172.\r\n\r\n   [1264] This may be Sirakhs or Sirakhsh (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1265] _Tūshlīq tūshdīn yūrdī bīrūrlār._ At least two meanings\r\n   can be given to these words. Circumstances seem to exclude the\r\n   one in which the Memoirs (p. 222) and _Mémoires_ (ii, 7) have\r\n   taken them here, _viz._ \"each man went off to shift for\r\n   himself\", and \"chacun s'en alla de son côté et s'enfuit comme\r\n   il put\", because Ẕū'n-nūn did not go off, and the Mīrzās broke\r\n   up after his defeat. I therefore suggest another reading, one\r\n   prompted by the Mīrzās' vague fancies and dreams of what they\r\n   might do, but did not.\r\n\r\n   [1266] The encounter was between \"Belāq-i-marāl and\r\n   Rabāṯ-i-`alī-sher, near Bādghīs\" (Raverty's _Notes_ p. 580).\r\n   For particulars of the taking of Herī _see_ Ḥ.S. iii, 353.\r\n\r\n   [1267] One may be the book-name, the second the name in common\r\n   use, and due to the colour of the buildings. But Bābur may be\r\n   making an ironical jest, and nickname the fort by a word\r\n   referring to the defilement (_ālā_) of Aūzbeg possession. (Cf.\r\n   Ḥ.S. iii, 359.)\r\n\r\n   [1268] Mr. Erskine notes that Badī`u'z-zamān took refuge with\r\n   Shāh Ismā`īl _Ṣafawī_ who gave him Tabrīz. When the Turkish\r\n   Emperor Sālim took Tabrīz in 920 AH. (1514 AD.), he was taken\r\n   prisoner and carried to Constantinople, where he died in 923\r\n   AH. (1517 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [1269] In the fort were his wife Kābulī Begīm, d. of Aūlūgh\r\n   Beg M. _Kābulī_ and Ruqaiya Āghā, known as the Nightingale. A\r\n   young daughter of the Mīrzā, named the Rose-bud (Chūchak), had\r\n   died just before the siege. After the surrender of the fort,\r\n   Kābulī Begīm was married by Mīrzā Kūkūldāsh (perhaps\r\n   `Āshiq-i-muḥammad _Arghūn_); Ruqaiya by Tīmūr Sl. _Aūzbeg_\r\n   (Ḥ.S. iii, 359).\r\n\r\n   [1270] The _Khuṯba_ was first read for Shaibāq Khān in Herī on\r\n   Friday Muḥarram 15th 913 AH. (May 27th 1507 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [1271] There is a Persian phrase used when a man engages in an\r\n   unprofitable undertaking _Kīr-i-khar gerift_, _i.e._ _Asini\r\n   nervum deprehendet_ (Erskine). The Ḥ.S. does not mention\r\n   Banā'i as fleecing the poets but has much to say about one\r\n   Maulānā `Abdu'r-raḥīm a Turkistānī favoured by Shaibānī, whose\r\n   victim Khwānd-amīr was, amongst many others. Not infrequently\r\n   where Bābur and Khwānd-amīr state the same fact, they\r\n   accompany it by varied details, as here (Ḥ.S. iii, 358, 360).\r\n\r\n   [1272] _`adat._ Muḥammadan Law fixes a term after widowhood or\r\n   divorce within which re-marriage is unlawful. Light is thrown\r\n   upon this re-marriage by Ḥ.S. iii, 359. The passage, a\r\n   somewhat rhetorical one, gives the following details:—\"On\r\n   coming into Her[i.] on Muḥarram 11th, Shaibānī at once set\r\n   about gathering in the property of the Tīmūrids. He had the\r\n   wives and daughters of the former rulers brought before him.\r\n   The great lady Khān-zāda Begīm (f. 163_b_) who was daughter of\r\n   Aḥmad Khān, niece of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, and wife of Muz̤affar\r\n   Mīrzā, shewed herself pleased in his presence. Desiring to\r\n   marry him, she said Muz̤affar M. had divorced her two years\r\n   before. Trustworthy persons gave evidence to the same effect,\r\n   so she was united to Shaibānī in accordance with the glorious\r\n   Law. Mihr-angez Begīm, Muẓaffar M.'s daughter, was married to\r\n   `Ubaidu'llāh Sl. (_Aūzbeg_); the rest of the chaste ladies\r\n   having been sent back into the city, Shaibānī resumed his\r\n   search for property.\" Manifestly Bābur did not believe in the\r\n   divorce Khwānd-amīr thus records.\r\n\r\n   [1273] A sarcasm this on the acceptance of literary honour\r\n   from the illiterate.\r\n\r\n   [1274] f. 191 and note; Pul-i-sālār may be an irrigation-dam.\r\n\r\n   [1275] Qalāt-i-nādirī, the birth-place of Nādir Shāh, n. of\r\n   Mashhad and standing on very strong ground (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1276] This is likely to be the road passing through the\r\n   Carfax of Rabāṯ-i-sangbast, described by Daulat-shāh (Browne,\r\n   p. 176).\r\n\r\n   [1277] This will mean that the Arghūns would acknowledge his\r\n   suzerainty; Ḥaidar Mīrzā however says that Shāh Beg had higher\r\n   views (T. R. p. 202). There had been earlier negotiations\r\n   between Ẕū'n-nūn with Badī`u'z-zamān and Bābur which may have\r\n   led to the abandonment of Bābur's expedition in 911 AD. (f.\r\n   158; Ḥ.S. iii, 323; Raverty's account (_Notes_ p. 581-2) of\r\n   Bābur's dealings with the Arghūn chiefs needs revision).\r\n\r\n   [1278] They will have gone first to Tūn or Qāīn, thence to\r\n   Mashhad, and seem likely to have joined the Begīm after\r\n   cross-cutting to avoid Herī.\r\n\r\n   [1279] _yāghī wilāyatī-ghā kīlādūrghān._ There may have been\r\n   an accumulation of caravans on their way to Herāt, checked in\r\n   Qalāt by news of the Aūzbeg conquest.\r\n\r\n   [1280] Jahāngīr's son, thus brought by his mother, will have\r\n   been an infant; his father had gone back last year with Bābur\r\n   by the mountain road and had been left, sick and travelling in\r\n   a litter, with the baggage when Bābur hurried on to Kābul at\r\n   the news of the mutiny against him (f. 197); he must have died\r\n   shortly afterwards, seemingly between the departure of the two\r\n   rebels from Kābul (f. 201_b_-202) and the march out for\r\n   Qandahār. Doubtless his widow now brought her child to claim\r\n   his uncle Bābur's protection.\r\n\r\n   [1281] Persians pay great attention in their correspondence\r\n   not only to the style but to the kind of paper on which a\r\n   letter is written, the place of signature, the place of the\r\n   seal, and the situation of the address. Chardin gives some\r\n   curious information on the subject (Erskine). Bābur marks the\r\n   distinction of rank he drew between the Arghūn chiefs and\r\n   himself when he calls their letter to him, _`arẓ-dāsht_, his\r\n   to them _khat̤t̤_. His claim to suzerainty over those chiefs\r\n   is shewn by Ḥaidar Mīrzā to be based on his accession to\r\n   Tīmūrid headship through the downfall of the Bāī-qarās, who\r\n   had been the acknowledged suzerains of the Arghūns now\r\n   repudiating Bābur's claim. Cf. Erskine's _History of India_ i,\r\n   cap. 3.\r\n\r\n   [1282] on the main road, some 40 miles east of Qandahār.\r\n\r\n   [1283] var. Kūr or Kawar. If the word mean _ford_, this might\r\n   well be the one across the Tarnak carrying the road to Qarā\r\n   (maps). Here Bābur seems to have left the main road along the\r\n   Tarnak, by which the British approach was made in 1880 AD.,\r\n   for one crossing west into the valley of the Argand-āb.\r\n\r\n   [1284] Bābā Ḥasan _Abdāl_ is the Bābā Walī of maps. The same\r\n   saint has given his name here, and also to his shrine east of\r\n   Atak where he is known as Bābā Walī of Qandahār. The torrents\r\n   mentioned are irrigation off-takes from the Argand-āb, which\r\n   river flows between Bābā Walī and Khalishak. Shāh Beg's force\r\n   was south of the torrents (cf. Murghān-koh on S.A.W. map).\r\n\r\n   [1285] The narrative and plans of _Second Afghan War_ (Murray\r\n   1908) illustrate Bābur's movements and show most of the places\r\n   he names. The end of the 280 mile march, from Kābul to within\r\n   sight of Qandahār, will have stirred in the General of 1507\r\n   what it stirred in the General of 1880. Lord Roberts speaking\r\n   in May 1913 in Glasgow on the rapid progress of the movement\r\n   for National Service thus spoke:—\"A memory comes over me which\r\n   turns misgiving into hope and apprehension into confidence. It\r\n   is the memory of the morning when, accompanied by two of\r\n   Scotland's most famous regiments, the Seaforths and the\r\n   Gordons, at the end of a long and arduous march, _I saw in the\r\n   distance the walls and minarets of Qandahar, and knew that the\r\n   end of a great resolve and a great task was near._\"\r\n\r\n   [1286] _mīn tāsh `imārat qāzdūrghān tūmshūghī-nīng alīdā_; 215\r\n   f. l68_b_, _`imarātī kah az sang yak pāra farmūda būdīm_; 217\r\n   f. 143_b_, _jāy kah man `imāratī sākhtam_; Mems. p. 226, where\r\n   I have built a palace; _Méms._ ii, 15, _l'endroit même où j'ai\r\n   bâti un palais_. All the above translations lose the sense of\r\n   _qāzdūrghān_, am causing to dig out, to quarry stone. Perhaps\r\n   for coolness' sake the dwelling was cut out in the living\r\n   rock. That the place is south-west of the main _ạrīqs_, near\r\n   Murghān-koh or on it, Bābur's narrative allows. Cf. Appendix\r\n   J.\r\n\r\n   [1287] _sic_, Ḥai. MS. There are two Lakhshas, Little Lakhsha,\r\n   a mile west of Qandahār, and Great Lakhsha, about a mile s.w.\r\n   of Old Qandahār, 5 or 6 m. from the modern one (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1288] This will be the main irrigation channel taken off from\r\n   the Argand-āb (Maps).\r\n\r\n   [1289] _tamām aīlīkīdīn—aīsh-kīlūr yīkītlār_, an idiomatic\r\n   phrase used of `Alī-dost (f. 14_b_ and n.), not easy to\r\n   express by a single English adjective.\r\n\r\n   [1290] The _tawāchī_ was a sort of adjutant who attended to\r\n   the order of the troops and carried orders from the general\r\n   (Erskine). The difficult passage following gives the Turkī\r\n   terms Bābur selected to represent Arabic military ones.\r\n\r\n   [1291] Ar. _aḥad_ (_Āyīn-i-akbarī_, Blochmann, index _s.n._).\r\n   The word _būī_ recurs in the text on f. 210.\r\n\r\n   [1292] _i.e._ the _būī tīkīnī_ of f. 209_b_, the _khāṣa\r\n   tābīn_, close circle.\r\n\r\n   [1293] As Mughūls seem unlikely to be descendants of Muḥammad,\r\n   perhaps the title Sayyid in some Mughūl names here, may be a\r\n   translation of a Mughūl one meaning Chief.\r\n\r\n   [1294] _Arghūn-nīng qarāsī_, a frequent phrase.\r\n\r\n   [1295] in sign of submission.\r\n\r\n   [1296] f. 176. It was in 908 AH. [1502 AD.].\r\n\r\n   [1297] This word seems to be from _sānjmāq_, to prick or stab;\r\n   and here to have the military sense of _prick_, _viz._ riding\r\n   forth. The Second Pers. trs. (217 f. 144_b_) translates it by\r\n   _ghauta khūrda raft_, went tasting a plunge under water (215\r\n   f. 170; Muḥ. _Shīrāzī_'s lith. ed. p. 133). Erskine (p. 228),\r\n   as his Persian source dictates, makes the men sink into the\r\n   soft ground; de Courteille varies much (ii, 21).\r\n\r\n   [1298] Ar. _akhmail_, so translated under the known presence\r\n   of trees; it may also imply soft ground (Lane p. 813 col. b)\r\n   but soft ground does not suit the purpose of _arīqs_\r\n   (channels), the carrying on of water to the town.\r\n\r\n   [1299] The S.A.W. map is useful here.\r\n\r\n   [1300] That he had a following may be inferred.\r\n\r\n   [1301] Ḥai.

The second Pers. trs. (217 f. 145_b_) has a gloss of\r\n   _ātqū u tika_; this consequently Erskine follows (p. 229) and\r\n   adds a note explaining the punishment. Ilminsky has the gloss\r\n   also (p. 269), thus indicating Persian and English influence.\r\n\r\n   [1303] No MS. gives the missing name.\r\n\r\n   [1304] The later favour mentioned was due to Saṃbhal's\r\n   laborious release of his master from Aūzbeg captivity in 917\r\n   AH. (1511 AD.) of which Erskine quotes a full account from the\r\n   _Tārīkh-i-sind_ (History of India i, 345).\r\n\r\n   [1305] Presumably he went by Sabzār, Daulatābād, and Washīr.\r\n\r\n   [1306] f. 202 and note to _Chaghatāī_.\r\n\r\n   [1307] This will be for the Nīngnahār _tūmān_ of Lamghān.\r\n\r\n   [1308] He was thus dangerously raised in his father's place of\r\n   rule.\r\n\r\n   [1309] ff. 10_b_, 11_b_. Ḥaidar M. writes, \"Shāh Begīm laid\r\n   claim to Badakhshān, saying, \"It has been our hereditary\r\n   kingdom for 3000 years; though I, being a woman, cannot myself\r\n   attain sovereignty, yet my grandson Mīrzā Khān can hold it\"\r\n   (T. R. p. 203).\r\n\r\n   [1310] _tībrādīlār._ The agitation of mind connoted, with\r\n   movement, by this verb may well have been, here, doubt of\r\n   Bābur's power to protect.\r\n\r\n   [1311] _tūshlūq tūshdīn tāghghā yūrūkāīlār._ Cf. 205_b_ for\r\n   the same phrase, with supposedly different meaning.\r\n\r\n   [1312] _qāngshār_ lit. ridge of the nose.\r\n\r\n   [1313] _bīr aūq ham qūīā-ālmādīlār_ (f. 203_b_ note to\r\n   _chāpqūn_).\r\n\r\n   [1314] This will have been news both of Shaibāq Khān and of\r\n   Mīrzā Khān. The Pers. trss. vary here (215 f. 173 and 217 f.\r\n   148).\r\n\r\n   [1315] Index _s.n._\r\n\r\n   [1316] Māh-chūchūk can hardly have been married against her\r\n   will to Qāsim. Her mother regarded the alliance as a family\r\n   indignity; appealed to Shāh Beg and compassed a rescue from\r\n   Kābul while Bābur and Qāsim were north of the Oxus [_circa_\r\n   916 AH.]. Māh-chūchūk quitted Kābul after much hesitation, due\r\n   partly to reluctance to leave her husband and her infant of 18\r\n   months, [Nāhīd Begīm,] partly to dread less family honour\r\n   might require her death (Erskine's _History_, i, 348 and\r\n   Gul-badan's _Humāyūn-nāma_).\r\n\r\n   [1317] Erskine gives the fort the alternative name \"Kaliūn\",\r\n   locates it in the Bādghīs district east of Herī, and quotes\r\n   from Abū'l-ghāzī in describing its strong position (_History_\r\n   i, 282). Ḥ.S. Tīrah-tū.\r\n\r\n   [1318] f. 133 and note. Abū'l-faẓl mentions that the\r\n   inscription was to be seen in his time.\r\n\r\n   [1319] This fief ranks in value next to the Kābul _tūmān_.\r\n\r\n   [1320] Various gleanings suggest motives for Bābur's assertion\r\n   of supremacy at this particular time. He was the only Tīmūrid\r\n   ruler and man of achievement; he filled Ḥusain _Bāī-qarā_'s\r\n   place of Tīmūrid headship; his actions through a long period\r\n   show that he aimed at filling Tīmūr Beg's. There were those\r\n   who did not admit his suzerainty,—Tīmūrids who had rebelled,\r\n   Mughūls who had helped them, and who would also have helped\r\n   Sa`īd Khān _Chaghatāī_, if he had not refused to be\r\n   treacherous to a benefactor; there were also the Arghūns,\r\n   Chīngīz-khānids of high pretensions. In old times the Mughūl\r\n   Khāqāns were _pādshāh_ (supreme); Pādshāh is recorded in\r\n   history as the style of at least Sātūq-būghra Khān Pādshāh\r\n   Ghāzī; no Tīmūrid had been lifted by his style above all\r\n   Mīrzās. When however Tīmūrids had the upper hand, Bābur's\r\n   Tīmūrid grandfather Abū-sa`īd asserted his _de facto_\r\n   supremacy over Bābur's Chaghatāī grandfather Yūnas (T. R. p.\r\n   83). For Bābur to re-assert that supremacy by assuming the\r\n   Khāqān's style was highly opportune at this moment. To be\r\n   Bābur Supreme was to declare over-lordship above Chaghatāī and\r\n   Mughūl, as well as over all Mīrzās. It was done when his sky\r\n   had cleared; Mīrzā Khān's rebellion was scotched; the Arghūns\r\n   were defeated; he was the stronger for their lost possessions;\r\n   his Aūzbeg foe had removed to a less ominous distance; and\r\n   Kābul was once more his own.\r\n\r\n   Gul-badan writes as if the birth of his first-born son Humāyūn\r\n   were a part of the uplift in her father's style, but his\r\n   narrative does not support her in this, since the order of\r\n   events forbids.\r\n\r\n   [1321] The \"Khān\" in Humāyūn's title may be drawn from his\r\n   mother's family, since it does not come from Bābur. To whose\r\n   family Māhīm belonged we have not been able to discover. It is\r\n   one of the remarkable omissions of Bābur, Gul-badan and\r\n   Abū'l-faẓl that they do not give her father's name. The topic\r\n   of her family is discussed in my Biographical Appendix to\r\n   Gul-badan's _Humāyūn-nāma_ and will be taken up again, here,\r\n   in a final Appendix on Bābur's family.\r\n\r\n   [1322] Elph. MS. f. 172_b_; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 174_b_ and 217\r\n   f. 148_b_; Mems. p. 234.\r\n\r\n   [1323] on the head-waters of the Tarnak (R.'s _Notes_ App. p.\r\n   34).\r\n\r\n   [1324] Bābur has made no direct mention of his half-brother's\r\n   death (f. 208 and n. to Mīrzā).\r\n\r\n   [1325] This may be Darwesh-i-`alī of f. 210; the Sayyid in his\r\n   title may merely mean chief, since he was a Mughūl.\r\n\r\n   [1326] Several of these mutineers had fought for Bābur at\r\n   Qandahār.\r\n\r\n   [1327] It may be useful to recapitulate this Mīrzā's\r\n   position:—In the previous year he had been left in charge of\r\n   Kābul when Bābur went eastward in dread of Shaibānī, and, so\r\n   left, occupied his hereditary place. He cannot have hoped to\r\n   hold Kābul if the Aūzbeg attacked it; for its safety and his\r\n   own he may have relied, and Bābur also in appointing him, upon\r\n   influence his Arghūn connections could use. For these, one was\r\n   Muqim his brother-in-law, had accepted Shaibānī's suzerainty\r\n   after being defeated in Qandahār by Bābur. It suited them\r\n   better no doubt to have the younger Mīrzā rather than Bābur in\r\n   Kābul; the latter's return thither will have disappointed them\r\n   and the Mīrzā; they, as will be instanced later, stood ready\r\n   to invade his lands when he moved East; they seem likely to\r\n   have promoted the present Mughūl uprising. In the battle which\r\n   put this down, the Mīrzā was captured; Bābur pardoned him; but\r\n   he having rebelled again, was then put to death.\r\n\r\n   [1328] Bāgh-i-yūrūnchqā may be an equivalent of Bāgh-i-safar,\r\n   and the place be one of waiting \"up to\" (_ūnchqā_) the journey\r\n   (_yūr_). _Yūrūnchqā_ also means _clover_ (De Courteille).\r\n\r\n   [1329] He seems to have been a brother or uncle of Humāyūn's\r\n   mother Māhīm (Index; A. N. trs. i, 492 and note).\r\n\r\n   [1330] In all MSS. the text breaks off abruptly here, as it\r\n   does on f. 118_b_ as though through loss of pages, and a blank\r\n   of narrative follows. Before the later gap of f. 251_b_\r\n   however the last sentence is complete.\r\n\r\n   [1331] Index _s. n. Bābur-nāma_, date of composition and gaps.\r\n\r\n   [1332] _ibid._\r\n\r\n   [1333] Jumāda I, 14th 968 AH.-Jan. 31st 1561 AD. Concerning\r\n   the book _see_ Elliot and Dowson's _History of India_ vi, 572\r\n   and JRAS 1901 p. 76, H. Beveridge's art. _On Persian MSS. in\r\n   Indian Libraries_.\r\n\r\n   [1334] The T. R. gives the names of two only of the champions\r\n   but Firishta, writing much later gives all five; we surmise\r\n   that he found his five in the book of which copies are not now\r\n   known, the _Tārīkh-i Muḥ. `Ārif Qandahārī_. Firishta's five\r\n   are `Ali _shab-kūr_ (night-blind), `Alī _Sīstānī_, Naẕar\r\n   Bahādur _Aūzbeg_, Ya`qūb _tez-jang_ (swift in fight), and\r\n   Aūzbeg Bahādur. Ḥaidar's two names vary in the MSS. of the T.\r\n   R. but represent the first two of Firishta's list.\r\n\r\n   [1335] There are curious differences of statement about the\r\n   date of Shaibānī's death, possibly through confusion between\r\n   this and the day on which preliminary fighting began near\r\n   Merv. Ḥaidar's way of expressing the date carries weight by\r\n   its precision, he giving _roz-i-shakk_ of Ramẓān, _i.e._ a day\r\n   of which there was doubt whether it was the last of Sha`bān or\r\n   the first of Ramẓān (Lane, _yauma'u'l-shakk_). As the sources\r\n   support Friday for the day of the week and on a Friday in the\r\n   year 915 AH. fell the 29th of Sha`bān, the date of Shaibānī's\r\n   death seems to be Friday Sha`bān 29th 915 AH. (Friday December\r\n   2nd 1510 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [1336] If my reading be correct of the Turkī passage\r\n   concerning wines drunk by Bābur which I have noted on f. 49\r\n   (_in loco_ p. 83 n. 1), it was during this occupation of Kābul\r\n   that Bābur first broke the Law against stimulants.\r\n\r\n   [1337] Mr. R. S. Poole found a coin which he took to be one\r\n   struck in obedience to Bābur's compact with the Shāh (B.M.Cat.\r\n   of the coins of Persian Shāhs 1887, pp. xxiv _et seq._; T.R.\r\n   p. 246 n.).\r\n\r\n   [1338] It was held by Aḥmad-i-qāsim _Kohbur_ and is referred\r\n   to on f. 234_b_, as one occasion of those in which Dost Beg\r\n   distinguished himself.\r\n\r\n   [1339] Schuyler's _Turkistān_ has a good account and picture\r\n   of the mosque. `Ubaid's vow is referred to in my earlier\r\n   mention of the _Sūlūku'l-mulūk_. It may be noted here that\r\n   this MS. supports the spelling _Bābur_ by making the second\r\n   syllable rhyme to _pūr_, as against the form _Bābar_.\r\n\r\n   [1340] _aūrūq._ Bābur refers to this exodus on f. 12_b_ when\r\n   writing of Daulat-sulṯān Khānīm.\r\n\r\n   [1341] It is one recorded with some variation, in Niyāz\r\n   Muḥammad _Khukandī's Tārīkh-i-shāhrukhī_ (Kazan, 1885) and\r\n   Nalivkine's _Khānate of Khokand_ (p. 63). It says that when\r\n   Bābur in 918 AH. (1512 AD.) left Samarkand after defeat by the\r\n   Aūzbegs, one of his wives, Sayyida Āfāq who accompanied him in\r\n   his flight, gave birth to a son in the desert which lies\r\n   between Khujand and Kand-i-badām; that Bābur, not daring to\r\n   tarry and the infant being too young to make the impending\r\n   journey, left it under some bushes with his own girdle round\r\n   it in which were things of price; that the child was found by\r\n   local people and in allusion to the valuables amongst which it\r\n   lay, called Altūn bīshik (golden cradle); that it received\r\n   other names and was best known in later life as Kḥudāyān\r\n   Sulṯān. He is said to have spent most of his life in Akhsī; to\r\n   have had a son Tīngrī-yār; and to have died in 952 AH. (1545\r\n   AD.). His grandson Yār-i-muḥammad is said to have gone to\r\n   India to relations who was descendants of Bābur (JASB 1905 p.\r\n   137 H. Beveridge's art. _The Emperor Bābur_). What is against\r\n   the truth of this tradition is that Gul-badan mentions no such\r\n   wife as Sayyida Āfāq. Māhīm however seems to have belonged to\r\n   a religious family, might therefore be styled Sayyida, and, as\r\n   Bābur mentions (f. 220), had several children who did not live\r\n   (a child left as this infant was, might if not heard of, be\r\n   supposed dead). There is this opening allowed for considering\r\n   the tradition.\r\n\r\n   [1342] Bābur refers to this on f. 265.\r\n\r\n   [1343] The _Lubbu't-tawārīkh_ would fix Ramẓān 7th.\r\n\r\n   [1344] Mr. Erskine's quotation of the Persian original of the\r\n   couplet differs from that which I have translated (_History of\r\n   India_ ii, 326; _Tārīkh-i-badāyūnī_ Bib. Ind. ed. f. 444).\r\n   Perhaps in the latter a pun is made on Najm as the leader's\r\n   name and as meaning _fortune_; if so it points the more\r\n   directly at the Shāh. The second line is quoted by Badāyūnī on\r\n   his f. 362 also.\r\n\r\n   [1345] Some translators make Bābur go \"naked\" into the fort\r\n   but, on his own authority (f. 106_b_), it seems safer to\r\n   understand what others say, that he went stripped of\r\n   attendance, because it was always his habit even in times of\r\n   peace to lie down in his tunic; much more would he have done\r\n   so at such a crisis of his affairs as this of his flight to\r\n   Ḥiṣār.\r\n\r\n   [1346] Ḥaidar gives a graphic account of the misconduct of the\r\n   horde and of their punishment (T.R. p. 261-3).\r\n\r\n   [1347] One of the mutineers named as in this affair (T.R. p.\r\n   257) was Sl. Qulī _chūnāq_, a circumstance attracting\r\n   attention by its bearing on the cause of the _lacunae_ in the\r\n   _Bābur-nāma_, inasmuch as Bābur, writing at the end of his\r\n   life, expresses (f. 65) his intention to tell of this man's\r\n   future misdeeds. These misdeeds may have been also at Ḥiṣār\r\n   and in the attack there made on Bābur; they are known from\r\n   Ḥaidar to have been done at Ghaznī; both times fall within\r\n   this present gap. Hence it is clear that Bābur meant to write\r\n   of the events falling in the gap of 914 AH. onwards.\r\n\r\n   [1348] In 925 AH. (ff. 227 and 238) mention is made of\r\n   courtesies exchanged between Bābur and Muḥammad-i-zamān in\r\n   Balkh. The Mīrzā was with Bābur later on in Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n   [1349] Mīr Ma`ṣūm's _Tārīkh-i-sind_ is the chief authority for\r\n   Bābur's action after 913 AH. against Shāh Beg in Qandahār; its\r\n   translation, made in 1846 by Major Malet, shews some\r\n   manifestly wrong dates; they appear also in the B. M. MS. of\r\n   the work.\r\n\r\n   [1350] f. 216_b_ and note to \"Monday\".\r\n\r\n   [1351] Elph. MS. f. 173_b_; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 178 and 217 f.\r\n   149; Mems. p. 246. The whole of the Ḥijra year is included in\r\n   1519 AD. (Erskine). What follows here and completes the Kābul\r\n   section of the _Bābur-nāma_ is a diary of a little over 13\r\n   months' length, supplemented by matter of later entry. The\r\n   product has the character of a draft, awaiting revision to\r\n   harmonize it in style and, partly, in topic with the composed\r\n   narrative that breaks off under 914 AH.; for the diary,\r\n   written some 11 years earlier than that composed narrative,\r\n   varies, as it would be expected _à priori_ to vary, in style\r\n   and topic from the terse, lucid and idiomatic output of\r\n   Bābur's literary maturity. A good many obscure words and\r\n   phrases in it, several new from Bābur's pen, have opposed\r\n   difficulty to scribes and translators. Interesting as such\r\n   _minutiae_ are to a close observer of Turkī and of Bābur's\r\n   diction, comment on all would be tedious; a few will be found\r\n   noted, as also will such details as fix the date of entry for\r\n   supplementary matter.\r\n\r\n   [1352] Here Mr. Erskine notes that Dr. Leyden's translation\r\n   begins again; it broke off on f. 180_b_, and finally ends on\r\n   f. 223_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1353] This name is often found transliterated as Chandul or\r\n   [mod.] Jandul but the Ḥai. MS. supports Raverty's opinion that\r\n   Chandāwal is correct.\r\n\r\n   The year 925 AH. opens with Bābur far from Kābul and east of\r\n   the Khahr (fort) he is about to attack. Afghān and other\r\n   sources allow surmise of his route to that position; he may\r\n   have come down into the Chandāwal-valley, first, from taking\r\n   Chaghān-sarāī (f. 124, f. 134 and n.), and, secondly, from\r\n   taking the Gibrī stronghold of Ḥaidar-i-`alī _Bajaurī_ which\r\n   stood at the head of the Bābā Qarā-valley. The latter surmise\r\n   is supported by the romantic tales of Afghān chroniclers which\r\n   at this date bring into history Bābur's Afghān wife, Bībī\r\n   Mubāraka (f. 220_b_ and note; Mems. p. 250 n.; and Appendix K,\r\n   _An Afghān legend_). (It must be observed here that R.'s\r\n   _Notes_ (pp. 117, 128) confuse the two sieges, _viz._ of the\r\n   Gibrī fort in 924 AH. and of the Khahr of Bajaur in 925 AH.)\r\n\r\n   [1354] Raverty lays stress on the circumstance that the fort\r\n   Bābur now attacks has never been known as Bajaur, but always\r\n   simply as Khahr, the fort (the Arabic name for the place\r\n   being, he says, plain _Shahr_); just as the main stream is\r\n   called simply Rūd (the torrent). The name Khahr is still used,\r\n   as modern maps shew. There are indeed two neighbouring places\r\n   known simply as Khahr (Fort), _i.e._ one at the mouth of the\r\n   \"Mahmand-valley\" of modern campaigns, the other near the\r\n   Malakand (Fincastle's map).\r\n\r\n   [1355] This word the Ḥai. MS. writes, _passim_, Dilah-zāk.\r\n\r\n   [1356] Either Ḥaidar-i-`alī himself or his nephew, the latter\r\n   more probably, since no name is mentioned.\r\n\r\n   [1357] Looking at the position assigned by maps to Khahr, in\r\n   the _dū-āb_ of the Charmanga-water and the Rūd of Bajaur, it\r\n   may be that Bābur's left moved along the east bank of the\r\n   first-named stream and crossed it into the _dū-āb_, while his\r\n   centre went direct to its post, along the west side of the\r\n   fort.\r\n\r\n   [1358] _sū-kīrīshī_; to interpret which needs local knowledge;\r\n   it might mean where water entered the fort, or where water\r\n   disembogued from narrows, or, perhaps, where water is entered\r\n   for a ford. (The verb _kīrmāk_ occurs on f. 154_b_ and f. 227\r\n   to describe water coming down in spate.)\r\n\r\n   [1359] _dīwānawār_, perhaps a jest on a sobriquet earned\r\n   before this exploit, perhaps the cause of the man's later\r\n   sobriquet _dīwāna_ (f. 245_b_).\r\n\r\n   [1360] Text, t:r:k, read by Erskine and de Courteille as Turk;\r\n   it might however be a Turkī component in Jān-i-`alī or\r\n   Muḥibb-i-`alī. (Cf. Zenker _s.n. tirik_.)\r\n\r\n   [1361] _aūshūl gūnī_, which contrasts with the frequent\r\n   _aūshbū gūnī_ (this same day, today) of manifestly diary\r\n   entries; it may indicate that the full account of the siege is\r\n   a later supplement.\r\n\r\n   [1362] This puzzling word might mean cow-horn (_kau-sarū_) and\r\n   stand for the common horn trumpet. Erskine and de Courteille\r\n   have read it as _gau-sar_, the first explaining it as\r\n   _cow-head_, surmised to be a protection for matchlockmen when\r\n   loading; the second, as _justaucorps de cuir_. That the word\r\n   is baffling is shewn by its omission in I.O. 215 (f. 178_b_),\r\n   in 217 (f. 149_b_) and in Muḥ. _Shīrāzī_'s lith. ed. (p. 137).\r\n\r\n   [1363] or _farangī._ Much has been written concerning the\r\n   early use of gun-powder in the East. There is, however, no\r\n   well-authenticated fact to prove the existence of anything\r\n   like artillery there, till it was introduced from Europe.\r\n   Bābur here, and in other places (f. 267) calls his larger\r\n   ordnance Firingī, a proof that they were then regarded as\r\n   owing their origin to Europe. The Turks, in consequence of\r\n   their constant intercourse with the nations of the West, have\r\n   always excelled all the other Orientals in the use of\r\n   artillery; and, when heavy cannon were first used in India,\r\n   Europeans or Turks were engaged to serve them (Erskine). It is\r\n   owing no doubt to the preceding gap in his writings that we\r\n   are deprived of Bābur's account of his own introduction to\r\n   fire-arms. _See_ E. & D.'s _History of India_, vi, Appendix\r\n   _On the early use of gunpowder in India_.\r\n\r\n   [1364] var. _quṯbī_, _qūchīnī_.\r\n\r\n   [1365] This sobriquet might mean \"ever a fighter\", or an\r\n   \"argle-bargler\", or a brass shilling (Zenker), or (if written\r\n   _jing-jing_) that the man was visaged like the bearded reeding\r\n   (Scully in Shaw's Vocabulary). The _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_\r\n   includes a Mīrak Khān _Jang-jang_ in its list of Akbar's\r\n   Commanders.\r\n\r\n   [1366] _ghūl-dīn (awwal) aūl qūrghān-gha chīqtī._ I suggest to\r\n   supply _awwal_, first, on the warrant of Bābur's later\r\n   statement (f. 234_b_) that Dost was first in.\r\n\r\n   [1367] He was a son of Maulānā Muḥ. _Ṣadr_, one of the chief\r\n   men of `Umar-shaikh M.'s Court; he had six brothers, all of\r\n   whom spent their lives in Bābur's service, to whom, if we may\r\n   believe Abū'l-faẓl, they were distantly related (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1368] Bābur now returns towards the east, down the Rūd. The\r\n   _chashma_ by which he encamped, would seem to be near the\r\n   mouth of the valley of Bābā Qarā, one 30 miles long; it may\r\n   have been, anglicé, a spring [not that of the main stream of\r\n   the long valley], but the word may be used as it seems to be\r\n   of the water supplying the Bāgh-i-ṣafā (f. 224), _i.e._ to\r\n   denote the first considerable gathering-place of small\r\n   head-waters. It will be observed a few lines further on that\r\n   this same valley seems to be meant by \"Khwāja Khiẓr\".\r\n\r\n   [1369] He will have joined Bābur previous to Muḥarram 925 AH.\r\n\r\n   [1370] This statement, the first we have, that Bābur has\r\n   broken Musalmān Law against stimulants (f. 49 and n.), is\r\n   followed by many others more explicit, jotting down where and\r\n   what and sometimes why he drank, in a way which arrests\r\n   attention and asks some other explanation than that it is an\r\n   unabashed record of conviviality such conceivably as a\r\n   non-Musalmān might write. Bābur is now 37 years old; he had\r\n   obeyed the Law till past early manhood; he wished to return to\r\n   obedience at 40; he frequently mentions his lapses by a word\r\n   which can be translated as \"commitment of sin\" (_irtqāb_); one\r\n   gathers that he did not at any time disobey with easy\r\n   conscience. Does it explain his singular record,—one made in\r\n   what amongst ourselves would be regarded as a private\r\n   diary,—that his sins were created by Law? Had he a balance of\r\n   reparation in his thoughts?\r\n\r\n   Detaching into their separate class as excesses, all his\r\n   instances of confessed drunkenness, there remains much in his\r\n   record which, seen from a non-Musalmān point of view, is\r\n   venial; _e.g._ his _ṣubūhī_ appears to be the \"morning\" of the\r\n   Scot, the _Morgen-trank_ of the Teuton; his afternoon cup, in\r\n   the open air usually, may have been no worse than the sober\r\n   glass of beer or local wine of modern Continental Europe. Many\r\n   of these legal sins of his record were interludes in the day's\r\n   long ride, stirrup-cups some of them, all in a period of\r\n   strenuous physical activity. Many of his records are\r\n   collective and are phrased impersonally; they mention that\r\n   there was drinking, drunkenness even, but they give details\r\n   sometimes such as only a sober observer could include.\r\n\r\n   Bābur names a few men as drunkards, a few as entirely\r\n   obedient; most of his men seem not to have obeyed the Law and\r\n   may have been \"temperate drinkers\"; they effected work, Bābur\r\n   amongst them, which habitual drunkards could not have\r\n   compassed. Spite of all he writes of his worst excesses, it\r\n   must be just to remember his Musalmān conscience, and also the\r\n   distorting power of a fictitious sin. Though he broke the law\r\n   binding all men against excess, and this on several confessed\r\n   occasions, his rule may have been no worse than that of the\r\n   ordinarily temperate Western. It cannot but lighten judgment\r\n   that his recorded lapses from Law were often prompted by the\r\n   bounty and splendour of Nature; were committed amidst the\r\n   falling petals of fruit-blossom, the flaming fire of autumn\r\n   leaves, where the eye rested on the _arghwān_ or the orange\r\n   grove, the coloured harvest of corn or vine.\r\n\r\n   [1371] As Mr. Erskine observes, there seems to be no valley\r\n   except that of Bābā Qarā, between the Khahr and the\r\n   Chandāwal-valley; \"Khwāja Khiẓr\" and \"Bābā Qarā\" may be one\r\n   and the same valley.\r\n\r\n   [1372] Time and ingenuity would be needed to bring over into\r\n   English all the quips of this verse. The most obvious pun is,\r\n   of course, that on Bajaur as the compelling cause (_ba jaur_)\r\n   of the parting; others may be meant on _guzīd_ and _gazīd_, on\r\n   _sazīd_ and _chāra_. The verse would provide the holiday\r\n   amusement of extracting from it two justifiable translations.\r\n\r\n   [1373] His possessions extended from the river of Sawād to\r\n   Bāramūla; he was expelled from them by the Yūsuf-zāī\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1374] This will be the naze of the n.e. rampart of the Bābā\r\n   Qarā valley.\r\n\r\n   [1375] f. 4 and note; f. 276. Bābur seems to use the name for\r\n   several varieties of deer.\r\n\r\n   [1376] There is here, perhaps, a jesting allusion to the\r\n   darkening of complexion amongst the inhabitants of countries\r\n   from west to east, from Highlands to Indian plains.\r\n\r\n   [1377] In Dr. E. D. Ross' _Polyglot list of birds_ the\r\n   _sārigh(sārīq)-qūsh_ is said to frequent fields of ripening\r\n   grain; this suggests to translate its name as Thief-bird.\r\n\r\n   [1378] _Aquila chrysaetus_, the hunting eagle.\r\n\r\n   [1379] This _ārālīgh_ might be identified with the \"Miankalai\"\r\n   of maps (since Soghd, lying between two arms of the Zar-afshān\r\n   is known also as Mīānkal), but Raverty explains the Bajaur\r\n   Miankalai to mean Village of the holy men (_mīān_).\r\n\r\n   [1380] After 933 AH. presumably, when final work on the B.N.\r\n   was in progress.\r\n\r\n   [1381] Mr. Erskine notes that Pesh-grām lies north of Mahyar\r\n   (on the Chandāwal-water), and that he has not found Kahrāj (or\r\n   Kohrāj). Judging from Bābur's next movements, the two valleys\r\n   he names may be those in succession east of Chandāwal.\r\n\r\n   [1382] There is hardly any level ground in the cleft of the\r\n   Panj-kūra (R.'s _Notes_ p. 193); the villages are perched high\r\n   on the sides of the valley. The pass leading to them may be\r\n   Katgola (Fincastle's Map).\r\n\r\n   [1383] This account of Hind-āl's adoption is sufficiently\r\n   confused to explain why a note, made apparently by Humāyūn,\r\n   should have been appended to it (Appendix L, _On Hind-āl's\r\n   adoption_). The confusion reminds the reader that he has\r\n   before him a sort of memorandum only, diary jottings, apt to\r\n   be allusive and abbreviated. The expected child was Dil-dār's;\r\n   Māhīm, using her right as principal wife, asked for it to be\r\n   given to her. That the babe in question is here called Hind-āl\r\n   shews that at least part of this account of his adoption was\r\n   added after the birth and naming (f. 227).\r\n\r\n   [1384] One would be, no doubt, for Dil-dār's own information.\r\n   She then had no son but had two daughters, Gul-rang and\r\n   Gul-chihra. News of Hind-āl's birth reached Bābur in Bhīra,\r\n   some six weeks later (f. 227).\r\n\r\n   [1385] f. 218_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1386] Bībī Mubāraka, the Afghānī Aghācha of Gul-badan. An\r\n   attractive picture of her is drawn by the\r\n   _Tāwārikh-i-ḥāfi-i-raḥmat-khānī_. As this gives not only one\r\n   of Bābur's romantic adventures but historical matter, I append\r\n   it in my husband's translation [(A.Q.R. April 1901)] as\r\n   Appendix K, _An Afghān Legend_.\r\n\r\n   [1387] _Bī-sūt aīlī-nīng Bajaur-qūrghānī-dā manāsabatī-bār\r\n   jīhatī_; a characteristic phrase.\r\n\r\n   [1388] Perhaps the end of the early spring-harvest and the\r\n   spring harvesting-year. It is not the end of the campaigning\r\n   year, manifestly; and it is at the beginning of both the solar\r\n   and lunar years.\r\n\r\n   [1389] Perhaps, more than half-way between the Mid-day and\r\n   Afternoon Prayers. So too in the annals of Feb. 12th.\r\n\r\n   [1390] _tīl ālghālī_ (Pers. _zabān-gīrī_), a new phrase in the\r\n   B.N.\r\n\r\n   [1391] _chāsht_, which, being half-way between sunrise and the\r\n   meridian, is a variable hour.\r\n\r\n   [1392] See n. 2, f. 221.\r\n\r\n   [1393] Perhaps Maqām is the Mardān of maps.\r\n\r\n   [1394] Bhīra, on the Jehlam, is now in the Shāhpūr district of\r\n   the Panj-āb.\r\n\r\n   [1395] This will be the ford on the direct road from Mardān\r\n   for the eastward (Elphin-stone's _Caubul_ ii, 416).\r\n\r\n   [1396] The position of Sawātī is represented by the Suābī of\r\n   the G. of I. map (1909 AD.). Writing in about 1813 AD. Mr.\r\n   Erskine notes as worthy of record that the rhinoceros was at\r\n   that date no longer found west of the Indus.\r\n\r\n   [1397] Elph. MS. _ghura_, the 1st, but this is corrected to\r\n   16th by a marginal note. The Ḥai. MS. here, as in some other\r\n   places, has the context for a number, but omits the figures.\r\n   So does also the Elph. MS. in a good many places.\r\n\r\n   [1398] This is the Harru. Mr. Erskine observes that Bābur\r\n   appears to have turned sharp south after crossing it, since he\r\n   ascended a pass so soon after leaving the Indus and reached\r\n   the Sūhān so soon.\r\n\r\n   [1399] _i.e._ the Salt-range.\r\n\r\n   [1400] Mr. Erskine notes that (in his day) a _shāhrukhī_ may\r\n   be taken at a shilling or eleven pence sterling.\r\n\r\n   [1401] It is somewhat difficult not to forget that a man who,\r\n   like Bābur, records so many observations of geographical\r\n   position, had no guidance from Surveys, Gazetteers and Books\r\n   of Travel. Most of his records are those of personal\r\n   observation.\r\n\r\n   [1402] In this sentence Mr. Erskine read a reference to the\r\n   Musalmān Ararat, the Koh-i-jūd on the left bank of the Tigris.\r\n   What I have set down translates the Turkī words but, taking\r\n   account of Bābur's eye for the double use of a word, and\r\n   Erskine's careful work, done too in India, the Turkī may imply\r\n   reference to the Ararat-like summit of Sakeswar.\r\n\r\n   [1403] Here Dr. Leyden's version finally ends (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1404] Bhīra, as has been noted, is on the Jehlam; Khūsh-āb is\r\n   40 m. lower down the same river; Chīnīūt (Chīnī-wat?) is 50\r\n   miles south of Bhīra; Chīn-āb (China-water?) seems the name of\r\n   a tract only and not of a residential centre; it will be in\r\n   the Bar of Kipling's border-thief. Concerning Chīnīūt _see_ D.\r\n   G. Barkley's letter, JRAS 1899 p. 132.\r\n\r\n   [1405] _ṯaur yīrī waqī` būlūb tūr._ As on f. 160 of the valley\r\n   of Khwesh, I have taken _ṯaur_ to be Turkī, complete, shut in.\r\n\r\n   [1406] _chashma_ (f. 218_b_ and note).\r\n\r\n   [1407] The promised description is not found; there follows a\r\n   mere mention only of the garden [f. 369]. This entry can be\r\n   taken therefore as shewing an intention to write what is still\r\n   wanting from Ṣafar 926 AH. to Ṣafar 932 AH.\r\n\r\n   [1408] Mīr Muḥ. may have been a kinsman or follower of Mahdī\r\n   Khwāja. The entry on the scene, unannounced by introduction as\r\n   to parentage, of the Khwāja who played a part later in Bābur's\r\n   family affairs is due, no doubt, to the last gap of annals. He\r\n   is mentioned in the Translator's Note, _s.a._ 923 AH. (_See_\r\n   Gul-badan's H.N. Biographical Appendix _s.n._)\r\n\r\n   [1409] or Sihrind, mod. Sirhind or Sar-i-hind (Head of Hind).\r\n   It may be noted here, for what it may be found worth, that\r\n   Kh(w)āfī Khān [i, 402] calls Sar-i-hind the old name, says\r\n   that the place was once held by the Ghaznī dynasty and was its\r\n   Indian frontier, and that Shāh-jahān changed it to Sahrind.\r\n   The W.-i-B. I.O. 217 f. 155 writes Shahrind.\r\n\r\n   [1410] Three krores or crores of dāms, at 40 to the rupee,\r\n   would make this 750,000 rupees, or about £75,000 sterling\r\n   (Erskine); a statement from the ancient history of the rupī!\r\n\r\n   [1411] This Hindustānī word in some districts signifies the\r\n   head man of a trade, in others a landholder (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1412] In Mr. Erskine's time this sum was reckoned to be\r\n   nearly £20,000.\r\n\r\n   [1413] Here originally neither the Elph. MS. nor the Ḥai. MS.\r\n   had a date; it has been added to the former.\r\n\r\n   [1414] This rain is too early for the s.w. monsoon; it was\r\n   probably a severe fall of spring rain, which prevails at this\r\n   season or rather earlier, and extends over all the west of\r\n   Asia (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1415] _az ghīna shor sū._ Streams rising in the Salt-range\r\n   become brackish on reaching its skirts (G. of I.).\r\n\r\n   [1416] Here this will be the fermented juice of rice or of the\r\n   date-palm.\r\n\r\n   [1417] _Rauḥ_ is sometimes the name of a musical note.\r\n\r\n   [1418] a platform, with or without a chamber above it, and\r\n   supported on four posts.\r\n\r\n   [1419] so-written in the MSS. Cf. Raverty's _Notes_ and G. of\r\n   I.\r\n\r\n   [1420] Anglicé, cousins on the father's side.\r\n\r\n   [1421] The G. of I. describes it.\r\n\r\n   [1422] Elph. MS. f. 183b, _manṣūb_; Ḥai. MS. and 2nd W.-i-B.\r\n   _bīsūt_. The holder might be Bābā-i-kābulī of f. 225.\r\n\r\n   [1423] The 1st Pers. trs. (I.O. 215 f. 188b) and Kehr's MS.\r\n   [Ilminsky p. 293] attribute Hātī's last-recorded acts to Bābur\r\n   himself. The two mistaken sources err together elsewhere. M.\r\n   de Courteille corrects the defect (ii, 67).\r\n\r\n   [1424] night-guard. He is the old servant to whom Bābur sent a\r\n   giant _ashrafī_ of the spoils of India (Gul-badan's H.N.\r\n   _s.n._).\r\n\r\n   [1425] The _kīping_ or _kīpik_ is a kind of mantle covered\r\n   with wool (Erskine); the root of the word is _kīp_, dry.\r\n\r\n   [1426] _aūlūgh chāsht_, a term suggesting that Bābur knew the\r\n   _chota ḥāẓirī_, little breakfast, of Anglo-India. It may be\r\n   inferred, from several passages, that the big breakfast was\r\n   taken after 9 a.m. and before 12 p.m. Just below men are said\r\n   to put on their mail at _chāsht_ in the same way as, _passim_,\r\n   things other than prayer are said to be done at this or that\r\n   Prayer; this, I think, always implies that they are done after\r\n   the Prayer mentioned; a thing done shortly before a Prayer is\r\n   done \"close to\" or \"near\" or when done over half-way to the\r\n   following Prayer, the act is said to be done \"nearer\" to the\r\n   second (as was noted on f. 221).\r\n\r\n   [1427] _Juldū Dost Beg-nīng ātī-gha būldī._\r\n\r\n   [1428] The disarray of these names in the MSS. reveals\r\n   confusion in their source. Similar verbal disarray occurs in\r\n   the latter part of f. 229.\r\n\r\n   [1429] Manifestly a pun is made on the guide's name and on the\r\n   _cap-à-pié_ robe of honour the offenders did not receive.\r\n\r\n   [1430] _aūrdū-nīng aldī-gha_, a novel phrase.\r\n\r\n   [1431] I understand that the servants had come to do their\r\n   equivalent for \"kissing hands\" on an appointment _viz._ to\r\n   kneel.\r\n\r\n   [1432] spikenard. Speede's _Indian Handbook on Gardening_\r\n   identifies _saṃbhal_ with _Valeriana jatmansi_ (Sir W. Jones &\r\n   Roxburgh); \"it is the real spikenard of the ancients, highly\r\n   esteemed alike as a perfume and as a stimulant medicine;\r\n   native practitioners esteeming it valuable in hysteria and\r\n   epilepsy.\" Bābur's word _dirakht_ is somewhat large for the\r\n   plant.\r\n\r\n   [1433] It is not given, however.\r\n\r\n   [1434] _i.e._ through the Indus.\r\n\r\n   [1435] Perhaps this _aīkī-sū-ārāsī_ (_miyān-dū-āb_) was the\r\n   angle made by the Indus itself below Atak; perhaps one made by\r\n   the Indus and an affluent.\r\n\r\n   [1436] _ma'jūnī nāklīkī_, presumably under the tranquillity\r\n   induced by the drug.\r\n\r\n   [1437] _massadus_, the six sides of the world, _i.e._ all\r\n   sides.\r\n\r\n   [1438] This is the name of one of the five champions defeated\r\n   by Bābur in single combat in 914 AH. (Translator's Note _s.a._\r\n   914 AH.).\r\n\r\n   [1439] f. 145_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1440] Humāyūn was 12, Kāmrān younger; one surmises that Bābur\r\n   would have walked under the same circumstances.\r\n\r\n   [1441] _ṣabuḥī_, the morning-draught. In 1623 AD. Pietro della\r\n   Vallé took a _ṣabuḥī_ with Mr. Thomas Rastel, the head of the\r\n   merchants of Surat, which was of hot spiced wine and sipped in\r\n   the mornings to comfort the stomach (Hakluyt ed. p. 20).\r\n\r\n   [1442] f. 128 and note.\r\n\r\n   [1443] Anglicé, in the night preceding Tuesday.\r\n\r\n   [1444] f. 106b.\r\n\r\n   [1445] This would be the under-corselet to which the four\r\n   plates of mail were attached when mail was worn. Bābur in this\r\n   adventure wore no mail, not even his helm; on his head was the\r\n   under cap of the metal helm.\r\n\r\n   [1446] Index s.n. _gharīcha_.\r\n\r\n   [1447] The earlier account helps to make this one clearer (f.\r\n   106b).\r\n\r\n   [1448] f. 112 _et seq._\r\n\r\n   [1449] Catamite, mistakenly read as _khīz_ on f. 112b\r\n   (_Mémoires_ ii, 82).\r\n\r\n   [1450] He was acting for Bābur (Translator's Note _s.a._; Ḥ.S.\r\n   iii, 318; T.R. pp. 260, 270).\r\n\r\n   [1451] \"Honoured,\" in this sentence, represents Bābur's\r\n   honorific plural.\r\n\r\n   [1452] in 921 AH. (Translator's Note _s.a._; T.R. p. 356).\r\n\r\n   [1453] _i.e._ Mīr Muḥammad son of Nāṣir.\r\n\r\n   [1454] _i.e._ after the dethronement of the Bāī-qarā family by\r\n   Shaibānī.\r\n\r\n   [1455] He had been one of rebels of 921 AH. (Translator's Note\r\n   _s.a._; T.R. p. 356).\r\n\r\n   [1456] f. 137.\r\n\r\n   [1457] This is the Adjutant-bird, Pīr-i-dang and Hargila\r\n   (Bone-swallower) of Hindūstān, a migrant through Kābul. The\r\n   fowlers who brought it would be the Multänīs of f. 142_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1458] f. 280.\r\n\r\n   [1459] _Memoirs_, p. 267, sycamore; _Mémoires_ ii, 84,\r\n   _saules_; f. 137.\r\n\r\n   [1460] Perhaps with his long coat out-spread.\r\n\r\n   [1461] The fortnight's gap of record, here ended, will be due\r\n   to illness.\r\n\r\n   [1462] f. 203_b_ and n. to _Khams_, the Fifth. _Taṣadduq_\r\n   occurs also on f. 238 denoting money sent to Bābur. Was it\r\n   sent to him as Pādshāh, as the Qorān commands the _Khams_ to\r\n   be sent to the Imām, for the poor, the traveller and the\r\n   orphan?\r\n\r\n   [1463] Rose-water, sherbet, a purgative; English, jalap,\r\n   julep.\r\n\r\n   [1464] Mr. Erskine understood Bābur to say that he never had\r\n   sat sober while others drank; but this does not agree with the\r\n   account of Harāt entertainments [912 AH.], or with the tenses\r\n   of the passage here. My impression is that he said in effect\r\n   \"Every-one here shall not be deprived of their wine\".\r\n\r\n   [1465] This verse, a difficult one to translate, may refer to\r\n   the unease removed from his attendants by Bābur's permission\r\n   to drink; the pun in it might also refer to _well_ and _not\r\n   well_.\r\n\r\n   [1466] Presumably to aid his recovery.\r\n\r\n   [1467] _aūtkān yīl_, perhaps in the last and unchronicled\r\n   year; perhaps in earlier ones. There are several references in\r\n   the B.N. to the enforced migrations and emigrations of tribes\r\n   into Kābul.\r\n\r\n   [1468] Pūlād (Steel) was a son of Kūchūm, the then Khāqān of\r\n   the Aūzbegs, and Mihr-bānū who may be Bābur's half-sister.\r\n   [Index _s.n._]\r\n\r\n   [1469] This may be written for Mihr-bānū, Pūlād's mother and\r\n   Bābur's half-sister (?) and a jest made on her heart as\r\n   Pūlād's and as steel to her brother. She had not left husband\r\n   and son when Bābur got the upper hand, as his half-sister\r\n   Yādgār-sulṯān did and other wives of capture _e.g._ Ḥaidar's\r\n   sister _Ḥabība_. Bābur's rhymes in this verse are not of his\r\n   later standard, _āī ṣubāḥ, kūnkūīkā, kūnkūlī-kā_.\r\n\r\n   [1470] _Taṣadduq_ sent to Bābur would seem an acknowledgment\r\n   of his suzerainty in Balkh [Index _s.n._].\r\n\r\n   [1471] This is the Gīrdīz-pass [Raverty's _Notes_, Route 101].\r\n\r\n   [1472] Raverty (p. 677) suggests that Pātakh stands for\r\n   _bātqāq_, a quagmire (f. 16 and n.).\r\n\r\n   [1473] the dark, or cloudy spring.\r\n\r\n   [1474] _yāqīsh-līq qūl_, an unusual phrase.\r\n\r\n   [1475] var. Karmān, Kurmāh, Karmās. M. de C. read Kīr-mās, the\r\n   impenetrable. The forms would give Garm-ās, hot embers.\r\n\r\n   [1476] _balafré_; marked on the face; of a horse, starred.\r\n\r\n   [1477] Raverty's _Notes_ (p. 457) give a full account of this\r\n   valley; in it are the head-waters of the Tochī and the Zurmut\r\n   stream; and in it R. locates Rustam's ancient Zābul.\r\n\r\n   [1478] It is on the Kābul side of the Gīrdīz-pass and stands\r\n   on the Luhugūr-water (Logar).\r\n\r\n   [1479] f. 143.\r\n\r\n   [1480] At this point of the text there occurs in the Elph. MS.\r\n   (f. 195_b_) a note, manifestly copied from one marginal in an\r\n   archetype, which states that what follows is copied from\r\n   Bābur's own MS. The note (and others) can be seen in JRAS 1905\r\n   p. 754 _et seq._\r\n\r\n   [1481] Masson, iii, 145.\r\n\r\n   [1482] A _qūlāch_ is from finger-tip to finger-tip of the\r\n   outstretched arms (Zenker p. 720 and _Méms._ ii, 98).\r\n\r\n   [1483] Neither _interne_ is said to have died!\r\n\r\n   [1484] f. 143.\r\n\r\n   [1485] or Atūn's-village, one granted to Bābur's mother's old\r\n   governess (f. 96); Gul-badan's guest-list has also an Atūn\r\n   Māmā.\r\n\r\n   [1486] f. 235_b_ and note.\r\n\r\n   [1487] _miswāk_; _On les tire principalement de l'arbuste\r\n   épineux appelé capparis-sodata_ (de C. ii, 101 n.).\r\n\r\n   [1488] Gul-badan's H.N. Index s.n.\r\n\r\n   [1489] This being Ramẓān, Bābur did not break his fast till\r\n   sun-set. In like manner, during Ramẓān they eat in the morning\r\n   before sun-rise (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1490] A result, doubtless, of the order mentioned on f.\r\n   240_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1491] Bābur's wife Gul-rukh appears to have been his sister\r\n   or niece; he was a Begchīk. Cf. Gul-badan's H.N. trs. p. 233,\r\n   p. 234; T.R. p. 264-5.\r\n\r\n   [1492] This remark bears on the question of whether we now\r\n   have all Bābur wrote of Autobiography. It refers to a date\r\n   falling within the previous gap, because the man went to\r\n   Kāshghar while Bābur was ruling in Samarkand (T.R. p. 265).\r\n   The last time Bābur came from Khwāst to Kābul was probably in\r\n   920 AH.; if later, it was still in the gap. But an alternative\r\n   explanation is that looking over and annotating the diary\r\n   section, Bābur made this reference to what he fully meant to\r\n   write but died before being able to do so.\r\n\r\n   [1493] Anglicé, the right thumb, on which the archer's ring\r\n   (_zih-gīr_) is worn.\r\n\r\n   [1494] a daughter of Yūnas Khān, Ḥaidar's account of whom is\r\n   worth seeing.\r\n\r\n   [1495] _i.e._ the water of Luhugūr (Logar). Tradition says\r\n   that Būt-khāk (Idol-dust) was so named because there Sl.\r\n   Maḥmūd of Ghaznī had idols, brought by him out of Hindūstān,\r\n   pounded to dust. Raverty says the place is probably the site\r\n   of an ancient temple (_vahāra_).\r\n\r\n   [1496] Qāsim Beg's son, come, no doubt, in obedience to the\r\n   order of f. 240_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1497] The `Īd-i-fitr is the festival at the conclusion of the\r\n   feast of Ramẓān, celebrated on seeing the new moon of Shawwāl\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1498] f. 133_b_ and Appendix G, _On the names of the wines of\r\n   Nūr-valley_.\r\n\r\n   [1499] _i.e._ of the new moon of Shawwāl. The new moon having\r\n   been seen the evening before, which to Musalmāns was Monday\r\n   evening, they had celebrated the `Īd-i-fitr on Monday eve\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1500] Dīwān of Hāfiẕ lith. ed. p. 22. The couplet seems to be\r\n   another message to a woman (f. 238); here it might be to Bībī\r\n   Mubāraka, still under Khwāja Kalān's charge in Bajaur (f.\r\n   221).\r\n\r\n   [1501] Here and under date Sep. 30th the wording allows a\r\n   ford.\r\n\r\n   [1502] This may be what Masson writes of (i, 149) \"We reached\r\n   a spot where the water supplying the rivulet (of `Alī-masjid)\r\n   gushes in a large volume from the rocks to the left. I slaked\r\n   my thirst in the living spring and drank to repletion of the\r\n   delightfully cool and transparent water.\"\r\n\r\n   [1503] Mr. Erskine here notes, \"This appears to be a mistake\r\n   or oversight of Bābur. The eve of `Arafa\" (9th of Ẕū'l-ḥijja)\r\n   \"was not till the evening of Dec. 2nd 1519. He probably meant\r\n   to say the `Id-i-fitr which had occurred only five days\r\n   before, on Sep. 26th.\"\r\n\r\n   [1504] This was an affair of frontiers (T.R. p. 354).\r\n\r\n   [1505] Manucci gives an account of the place (Irvine iv, 439\r\n   and ii, 447).\r\n\r\n   [1506] Sep. 8th to Oct. 9th.\r\n\r\n   [1507] _khūsh rang-i khizān._ Sometimes Bābur's praise of\r\n   autumn allows the word _khizān_ to mean the harvest-crops\r\n   themselves, sometimes the autumnal colouring.\r\n\r\n   [1508] This I have taken to mean the Kābul _tūmān_. The Ḥai.\r\n   MS. writes _wilāyatlār_ (plural) thus suggesting that _aūl_\r\n   (those) may be omitted, and those countries (Transoxiana) be\r\n   meant; but the second Pers. trs. (I.O. 217 f. 169) supports\r\n   _wilāyat_, Kābul.\r\n\r\n   [1509] joyous, happy.\r\n\r\n   [1510] _y:lk:rān._ This word has proved a difficulty to all\r\n   translators. I suggest that it stands for _aīlīkarān_, what\r\n   came to hand (_aīlīk see_ de C.'s Dict.); also that it\r\n   contains puns referring to the sheep taken from the road\r\n   (_yūlkarān_) and to the wine of the year's yield (_yīlkarān_).\r\n   The way-side meal was of what came to hand, mutton and wine,\r\n   probably local.\r\n\r\n   [1511] f. 141_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1512] f. 217 and n.\r\n\r\n   [1513] I think Bābur means that the customary announcement of\r\n   an envoy or guest must have reached Kābul in his absence.\r\n\r\n   [1514] He is in the T.R. list of the tribe (p. 307); to it\r\n   belonged Sl. Aḥmad _Taṃbal_ (_ib._ p. 316).\r\n\r\n   [1515] _Qābil-nīng kūrī-nīng qāshī-ka_, lit. to the presence\r\n   of the tomb of Qābil, _i.e._ Cain the eponymous hero of Kābul.\r\n   The Elph. MS. has been altered to \"Qābil Beg\"!\r\n\r\n   [1516] Mr. Erskine surmised that the line was from some\r\n   religious poem of mystical meaning and that its profane\r\n   application gave offence.\r\n\r\n   [1517] His sobriquet _khāksār_, one who sits in the dust,\r\n   suits the excavator of a _kārez_. Bābur's route can be\r\n   followed in Masson's (iii, 110), apparently to the very\r\n   _kārez_.\r\n\r\n   [1518] In Masson's time this place was celebrated for vinegar.\r\n   To reach it and return must have occupied several hours.\r\n\r\n   [1519] Kunos, _āq tūīgūn_, white falcon; _`Amal-i-ṣāliḥ_ (I.O.\r\n   MS. No. 857, f. 45_b_), _taus tūīghūn_.\r\n\r\n   [1520] f. 246.\r\n\r\n   [1521] Nawā'ī himself arranged them according to the periods\r\n   of his life (Rieu's Pers. Cat. p. 294).\r\n\r\n   [1522] Elph. MS. f. 202_b_; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 175\r\n   (misplaced) and 217 f. 172; Mems. p. 281.\r\n\r\n   [1523] _pushta aūstīda_; the Jūī-khwūsh of f. 137.\r\n\r\n   [1524] The Ḥai. MS. omits a passage here; the Elph. MS. reads\r\n   _Qāsim Bulbulī nīng awī_, thus making \"nightingale\" a\r\n   sobriquet of Qāsim's own. Erskine (p. 281) has \"Bulbulī-hall\";\r\n   Ilminsky's words translate as, the house of Sayyid Qāsim's\r\n   nightingale (p. 321).\r\n\r\n   [1525] or Dūr-namā'ī, seen from afar.\r\n\r\n   [1526] _narm-dīk_, the opposite of a _qātīq yāī_, a stiff bow.\r\n   Some MSS. write _lāzim-dīk_ which might be read to mean such a\r\n   bow as his disablement allowed to be used.\r\n\r\n   [1527] Mr. Erskine, writing early in the 19th century, notes\r\n   that this seems an easy tribute, about 400 _rupīs_ _i.e._ £40.\r\n\r\n   [1528] This is one of the three routes into Lamghān of f. 133.\r\n\r\n   [1529] f. 251_b_ and Appendix F, _On the name Dara-i-nūr_.\r\n\r\n   [1530] This passage will be the basis of the account on f.\r\n   143_b_ of the winter-supply of fish in Lamghān.\r\n\r\n   [1531] This word or name is puzzling. Avoiding extreme detail\r\n   as to variants, I suggest that it is Dāūr-bīn for Dūr-namā'ī\r\n   if a place-name; or, if not, _dūr-bīn_, foresight (in either\r\n   case the preposition requires to be supplied), and it may\r\n   refer to foreseen need of and curiosity about Kāfir wines.\r\n\r\n   [1532] _chīūrtika_ or _chīūr-i-tika_, whether _sauterelle_ as\r\n   M. de Courteille understood, or _jānwār-i-ranga_ and _chīkūr_,\r\n   partridge as the 1st Persian trs. and as Mr. Erskine\r\n   (explaining _chūr-i-tīka_) thought, must be left open. Two\r\n   points arise however, (1) the time is January, the place the\r\n   deadly Bād-i-pīch pass; would these suit locusts? (2) If\r\n   Bābur's account of a splendid bird (f. 135) were based on this\r\n   experience, this would be one of several occurrences in which\r\n   what is entered in the Description of Kābul of 910 AH. is\r\n   found as an experience in the diary of 925-6 AH.\r\n\r\n   [1533] Ḥai. MS. _maḥali-da maẕkūr būlghūsīdūr_, but W.-i-B.\r\n   I.O. 215 f. 176 for _maḥali-da_, in its place, has _dar\r\n   majlis_ [in the collection], which may point to an intended\r\n   collection of Bābur's musical compositions. Either reading\r\n   indicates intention to write what we now have not.\r\n\r\n   [1534] Perhaps an equivalent for _farẓ-waqt_, the time of the\r\n   first obligatory prayer. Much seems to happen before the sun\r\n   got up high!\r\n\r\n   [1535] Koh-i-nūr, Rocky-mountains (?). _See_ Appendix F, _On\r\n   the name Dara-i-nūr_.\r\n\r\n   [1536] Steingass gives _būza_ as made of rice, millet, or\r\n   barley.\r\n\r\n   [1537] Is this connected with Arabic _kīmiyā'_, alchemy,\r\n   chemistry?\r\n\r\n   [1538] Turkī, a whirlpool; but perhaps the name of an office\r\n   from _aīgar_, a saddle.\r\n\r\n   [1539] The river on which the rafts were used was the Kūnār,\r\n   from Chītrāl.\r\n\r\n   [1540] An uncertain name. I have an impression that these\r\n   waters are medicinal, but I cannot trace where I found the\r\n   information. The visit paid to them, and the arrangement made\r\n   for bathing set them apart. The name of the place may convey\r\n   this speciality.\r\n\r\n   [1541] _panāhī_, the word used for the hiding-places of\r\n   bird-catchers on f. 140.\r\n\r\n   [1542] This will be the basis of the details about fishing\r\n   given on f. 143 and f. 143_b_. The statement that particulars\r\n   have been given allows the inference that the diary was\r\n   annotated after the _Description of Kābul_, in which the\r\n   particulars are, was written.\r\n\r\n   [1543] _qānlīqlār._ This right of private revenge which forms\r\n   part of the law of most rude nations, exists in a mitigated\r\n   form under the Muhammadan law. The criminal is condemned by\r\n   the judge, but is delivered up to the relations of the person\r\n   murdered, to be ransomed or put to death as they think fit\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1544] Here the text breaks off and a _lacuna_ separates the\r\n   diary of 11 months length which ends the Kābul section of the\r\n   _Bābur-nāma_ writings, from the annals of 932 AH. which begin\r\n   the Hindūstān section. There seems no reason why the diary\r\n   should have been discontinued.\r\n\r\n   [1545] Jan. 2nd 1520 to Nov. 17th 1525 AD. (Ṣafar 926 to Ṣafar\r\n   1st 932 AH.).\r\n\r\n   [1546] Index _s.nn._ Bāgh-i-ṣafā and B.N. _lacunae_.\r\n\r\n   [1547] Nominally Balkh seems to have been a Ṣafawī possession;\r\n   but it is made to seem closely dependent on Bābur by his\r\n   receipt from Muḥammad-i-zamān in it of _taṣadduq_ (money for\r\n   alms), and by his action connected with it (_q.v._).\r\n\r\n   [1548] _Tārīkh-i-sind_, Malet's trs. p. 77 and _in loco_, p.\r\n   365.\r\n\r\n   [1549] A chronogram given by Badāyūnī decides the vexed\r\n   question of the date of Sikandar _Lūdī's_\r\n   death—_Jannātu'l-firdūs nazlā_ = 923 (Bib. Ind. ed. i, 322,\r\n   Ranking trs. p. 425 n. 6). Erskine supported 924 AH. (i, 407),\r\n   partly relying on an entry in Bābur's diary (f. 226_b_) _s.d._\r\n   Rabī`u'l-awwal 1st 925 AH. (March 3rd 1519 AD.) which states\r\n   that on that day Mullā Murshid was sent to Ibrāhīm whose\r\n   father _Sikandar had died five or six months before_.\r\n\r\n   Against this is the circumstance that the entry about Mullā\r\n   Murshid is, perhaps entirely, certainly partly, of later entry\r\n   than what precedes and what follows it in the diary. This can\r\n   be seen on examination; it is a passage such as the diary\r\n   section shews in other places, added to the daily record and\r\n   giving this the character of a draft waiting for revision and\r\n   rewriting (fol. 216_b_ n.).\r\n\r\n   (To save difficulty to those who may refer to the L. & E.\r\n   _Memoirs_ on the point, I mention that the whole passage about\r\n   Mullā Murshid is displaced in that book and that the date\r\n   March 3rd is omitted.)\r\n\r\n   [1550] Shāl (the local name of English Quetta) was taken by\r\n   Ẕū'l-nūn in 884 AH. (1479 AD.); Sīwīstān Shāh Beg took, in\r\n   second capture, about 917 AH. (1511 AD.), from a colony of\r\n   Barlās Turks under Pīr Walī _Barlās_.\r\n\r\n   [1551] Was the attack made in reprisal for Shāh Beg's further\r\n   aggression on the Barlās lands and Bābur's hereditary\r\n   subjects? Had these appealed to the head of their tribe?\r\n\r\n   [1552] Le Messurier writes (_l.c._ p. 224) that at Old\r\n   Qandahār \"many stone balls lay about, some with a diameter of\r\n   18 inches, others of 4 or 5, chiselled out of limestone. These\r\n   were said to have been used in sieges in the times of the\r\n   Arabs and propelled from a machine called _manjanic_ a sort of\r\n   balista or catapult.\" Meantime perhaps they served Bābur!\r\n\r\n   [1553] \"Just then came a letter from Badakhshān saying, 'Mīrzā\r\n   Khān is dead; Mīrzā Sulaimān (his son) is young; the Aūzbegs\r\n   are near; take thought for this kingdom lest (which God\r\n   forbid) Badakhshān should be lost.'

Of these\r\n   last, special help in supplementary details is given for 932\r\n   AH. and part of 933 AH. by Shaikh Zain [_Khawāfi_]'s\r\n   _T̤abaqāt-i-bāburī_, which is a highly rhetorical paraphrase\r\n   of Bābur's narrative, requiring familiarity with ornate\r\n   Persian to understand. For all my references to it, I am\r\n   indebted to my husband. It may be mentioned as an interesting\r\n   circumstance that the B.M. possesses in Or. 1999 a copy of\r\n   this work which was transcribed in 998 AH. by one of\r\n   Khwānd-amīr's grandsons and, judging from its date, presumably\r\n   for Abū'l-faẓl's use in the _Akbar-nāma_.\r\n\r\n   Like part of the Kābul section, the Hindūstān one is in\r\n   diary-form, but it is still more heavily surcharged with\r\n   matter entered at a date later than the diary. It departs from\r\n   the style of the preceding diary by an occasional lapse into\r\n   courtly phrase and by exchange of some Turkī words for Arabic\r\n   and Persian ones, doubtless found current in Hind, _e.g._\r\n   _fauj_, _dīra_, _manzil_, _khail-khāna_.\r\n\r\n   [1566] This is the Logar affluent of the Bārān-water\r\n   (Kābul-river). Masson describes this haltingplace (iii, 174).\r\n\r\n   [1567] _muḥaqqar saughāt u bīlāk or tīlāk._ A small verbal\r\n   point arises about _bīlāk_ (or _tīlāk_). _Bīlāk_ is said by\r\n   Quatremère to mean a gift (N. et E. xiv, 119 n.) but here\r\n   _muḥaqqar saughāt_ expresses gift. Another meaning can be\r\n   assigned to _bīlāk_ here, [one had also by _tīlāk_,] _viz._\r\n   that of word-of-mouth news or communication, sometimes\r\n   supplementing written communication, possibly secret\r\n   instructions, possibly small domestic details. In _bīlāk_, a\r\n   gift, the root may be _bīl_, the act of knowing, in _tīlāk_ it\r\n   is _tīl_, the act of speaking [whence _tīl_, the tongue, and\r\n   _tīl tūtmāk_, to get news]. In the sentence noted, either word\r\n   would suit for a verbal communication. Returning to _bīlāk_ as\r\n   a gift, it may express the _nuance_ of English _token_, the\r\n   maker-known of friendship, affection and so-on. This\r\n   differentiates _bīlāk_ from _saughāt_, used in its frequent\r\n   sense of ceremonial and diplomatic presents of value and\r\n   importance.\r\n\r\n   [1568] With Sa`īd at this time were two Khānīms Sulṯān-nigār\r\n   and Daulat-sulṯān who were Bābur's maternal-aunts. Erskine\r\n   suggested Khūb-nigār, but she had died in 907 AH. (f. 96).\r\n\r\n   [1569] Humāyūn's non-arrival would be the main cause of delay.\r\n   Apparently he should have joined before the Kābul force left\r\n   that town.\r\n\r\n   [1570] The halt would be at Būt-khāk, the last station before\r\n   the Adīnapūr road takes to the hills.\r\n\r\n   [1571] Discussing the value of coins mentioned by Bābur,\r\n   Erskine says in his _History of India_ (vol. i, Appendix E.)\r\n   which was published in 1854 AD. that he had come to think his\r\n   estimates of the value of the coins was set too low in the\r\n   _Memoirs_ (published in 1826 AD.). This sum of 20,000\r\n   _shāhrukhīs_ he put at £1000. Cf. E. Thomas' _Pathan Kings of\r\n   Dihli and Resources of the Mughal Empire_.\r\n\r\n   [1572] One of Masson's interesting details seems to fit the\r\n   next stage of Bābur's march (iii, 179). It is that after\r\n   leaving Būt-khāk, the road passes what in the thirties of the\r\n   19th Century, was locally known as Bābur Pādshāh's Stone-heap\r\n   (cairn) and believed piled in obedience to Bābur's order that\r\n   each man in his army should drop a stone on it in passing. No\r\n   time for raising such a monument could be fitter than that of\r\n   the fifth expedition into Hindūstān when a climax of\r\n   opportunity allowed hope of success.\r\n\r\n   [1573] _rezāndalīk._ This Erskine translates, both here and on\r\n   ff. 253, 254, by _defluxion_, but de Courteille by _rhume de\r\n   cerveau_. Shaikh Zain supports de Courteille by writing, not\r\n   _rezāndalīk_, but _nuzla_, catarrh. De Courteille, in\r\n   illustration of his reading of the word, quotes Burnes'\r\n   account of an affection common in the Panj-āb and there called\r\n   _nuzla_, which is a running at the nostrils, that wastes the\r\n   brain and stamina of the body and ends fatally (_Travels in\r\n   Bukhara_ ed. 1839, ii, 41).\r\n\r\n   [1574] Tramontana, north of Hindū-kush.\r\n\r\n   [1575] Shaikh Zain says that the drinking days were Saturday,\r\n   Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday.\r\n\r\n   [1576] The Elph. Codex (f. 208_b_) contains the following note\r\n   of Humāyūn's about his delay; it has been expunged from the\r\n   text but is still fairly legible:—\"The time fixed was after\r\n   `Āshūrā (10th Muḥarram, a voluntary fast); although we arrived\r\n   after the next-following 10th (_`āshūr_, _i.e._ of Ṣafar), the\r\n   delay had been necessary. The purpose of the letters (Bābur's)\r\n   was to get information; (in reply) it was represented that the\r\n   equipment of the army of Badakhshān caused delay. If this\r\n   slave (Humāyūn), trusting to his [father's] kindness, caused\r\n   further delay, he has been sorry.\"\r\n\r\n   Bābur's march from the Bāgh-i-wafā was delayed about a month;\r\n   Humāyūn started late from Badakhshān; his force may have\r\n   needed some stay in Kābul for completion of equipment; his\r\n   personal share of blame for which he counted on his father's\r\n   forgiveness, is likely to have been connected with his\r\n   mother's presence in Kābul.\r\n\r\n   Humāyūn's note is quoted in Turkī by one MS. of the Persian\r\n   text (B.M. W.-i-B. 16,623 f. 128); and from certain\r\n   indications in Muḥammad _Shīrāzī_'s lithograph (p. 163),\r\n   appears to be in his archetype the Udaipūr Codex; but it is\r\n   not with all MSS. of the Persian text _e.g._ not with I.O. 217\r\n   and 218. A portion of it is in Kehr's MS. (p. 1086).\r\n\r\n   [1577] Bird's-dome [f. 145_b_, n.] or The pair (_qūsh_) of\r\n   domes.\r\n\r\n   [1578] _gūn khūd kīch būlūb aīdī_; a little joke perhaps at\r\n   the lateness both of the day and the army.\r\n\r\n   [1579] Shaikh Zain's maternal-uncle.\r\n\r\n   [1580] Shaikh Zain's useful detail that this man's pen-name\r\n   was Sharaf distinguishes him from Muḥammad Ṣāliḥ the author of\r\n   the _Shaibānī-nāma_.\r\n\r\n   [1581] _gosha_, angle (_cf._ _gosha-i-kār_, limits of work).\r\n   Parodies were to be made, having the same metre, rhyme, and\r\n   refrain as the model couplet.\r\n\r\n   [1582] I am unable to attach sense to Bābur's second line;\r\n   what is wanted is an illustration of two incompatible things.\r\n   Bābur's reflections [_infra_] condemned his verse. Shaikh Zain\r\n   describes the whole episode of the verse-making on the raft,\r\n   and goes on with, \"He (Bābur) excised this choice couplet from\r\n   the pages of his Acts (_Wāqi`āt_) with the knife of censure,\r\n   and scratched it out from the tablets of his noble heart with\r\n   the finger-nails of repentance. I shall now give an account of\r\n   this spiritual matter\" (_i.e._ the repentance), \"by presenting\r\n   the recantations of his Solomon-like Majesty in his very own\r\n   words, which are weightier than any from the lips of Aesop.\"\r\n   Shaikh Zain next quotes the Turkī passage here translated in\r\n   _b. Mention of the Mubīn_.\r\n\r\n   [1583] The _Mubīn_ (_q.v._ Index) is mentioned again and\r\n   quoted on f. 351_b_. In both places its name escaped the\r\n   notice of Erskine and de Courteille, who here took it for\r\n   _mīn_, I, and on f. 351_b_ omitted it, matters of which the\r\n   obvious cause is that both translators were less familiar with\r\n   the poem than it is now easy to be. There is amplest textual\r\n   warrant for reading _Mubīn_ in both the places indicated\r\n   above; its reinstatement gives to the English and French\r\n   translations what they have needed, namely, the clinch of a\r\n   definite stimulus and date of repentance, which was the\r\n   influence of the Mubīn in 928 AH. (1521-2 AD.). The whole\r\n   passage about the peccant verse and its fruit of contrition\r\n   should be read with others that express the same regret for\r\n   broken law and may all have been added to the diary at the\r\n   same time, probably in 935 AH. (1529 AD.). They will be found\r\n   grouped in the Index _s.n._ Bābur.\r\n\r\n   [1584] _mūndīn būrūn_, by which I understand, as the\r\n   grammatical construction will warrant, _before writing the\r\n   Mubīn_. To read the words as referring to the peccant verse,\r\n   is to take the clinch off the whole passage.\r\n\r\n   [1585] _i.e._ of the _Qorān_ on which the _Mubīn_ is based.\r\n\r\n   [1586] Dropping down-stream, with wine and good company, he\r\n   entirely forgot his good resolutions.\r\n\r\n   [1587] This appears to refer to the good thoughts embodied in\r\n   the _Mubīn_.\r\n\r\n   [1588] This appears to contrast with the \"sublime realities\"\r\n   of the _Qorān_.\r\n\r\n   [1589] In view of the interest of the passage, and because\r\n   this verse is not in the Rāmpūr _Dīwān_, as are many contained\r\n   in the Hindūstān section, the Turkī original is quoted. My\r\n   translation differs from those of Mr. Erskine and M. de\r\n   Courteille; all three are tentative of a somewhat difficult\r\n   verse.\r\n\r\n     _Nī qīlā mīn sīnīng bīla āī tīl?\r\n     Jihatīng dīn mīnīng aīchīm qān dūr.\r\n     Nīcha yakhshī dīsāng bū hazl aīla shi`r\r\n     Bīrī-sī faḥash ū bīrī yālghān dūr.\r\n     Gar dīsāng kūīmā mīn, bū jazm bīla\r\n     Jalāu'īngnī bū `arṣa dīn yān dūr._\r\n\r\n   [1590] The Qorān puts these sayings into the mouths of Adam\r\n   and Eve.\r\n\r\n   [1591] Ḥai. MS. _tīndūrūb_; Ilminsky, p. 327, _yāndūrūb_;\r\n   W.-i-B. I.O. 217, f. 175, _sard sākhta_.\r\n\r\n   [1592] Of `Alī-masjid the _Second Afghān War_ (official\r\n   account) has a picture which might be taken from Bābur's camp.\r\n\r\n   [1593] Shaikh Zain's list of the drinking-days (f. 252 note)\r\n   explains why sometimes Bābur says he preferred _ma`jūn_. In\r\n   the instances I have noticed, he does this on a drinking-day;\r\n   the preference will be therefore for a confection over wine.\r\n   December 9th was a Saturday and drinking-day; on it he\r\n   mentions the preference; Tuesday Nov. 21st was a drinking day,\r\n   and he states that he ate _ma`jūn_.\r\n\r\n   [1594] presumably the _karg-khāna_ of f. 222_b_,\r\n   rhinoceros-home in both places. A similar name applies to a\r\n   tract in the Rawalpindi District,—Bābur-khāna, Tiger-home,\r\n   which is linked to the tradition of Buddha's self-sacrifice to\r\n   appease the hunger of seven tiger-cubs. [In this Bābur-khāna\r\n   is the town Kacha-kot from which Bābur always names the river\r\n   Hārū.]\r\n\r\n   [1595] This is the first time on an outward march that Bābur\r\n   has crossed the Indus by boat; hitherto he has used the ford\r\n   above Attock, once however specifying that men on foot were\r\n   put over on rafts.\r\n\r\n   [1596] f. 253.\r\n\r\n   [1597] In my Translator's Note (p. 428), attention was drawn\r\n   to the circumstance that Bābur always writes Daulat Khān\r\n   _Yūsuf-khail_, and not Daulat Khān _Lūdī_. In doing this, he\r\n   uses the family- or clan-name instead of the tribal one,\r\n   _Lūdī_.\r\n\r\n   [1598] _i.e._ day by day.\r\n\r\n   [1599] _daryā_, which Bābur's precise use of words _e.g._ of\r\n   _daryā_, _rūd_, and _sū_, allows to apply here to the Indus\r\n   only.\r\n\r\n   [1600] Presumably this was near Parhāla, which stands, where\r\n   the Sūhān river quits the hills, at the eastern entrance of a\r\n   wild and rocky gorge a mile in length. It will have been up\r\n   this gorge that Bābur approached Parhāla in 925 AH.\r\n   (Rawalpindi Gazetteer p. 11).\r\n\r\n   [1601] _i.e._ here, bed of a mountain-stream.\r\n\r\n   [1602] The Elphinstone Codex here preserves the following\r\n   note, the authorship of which is attested by the scribe's\r\n   remark that it is copied from the handwriting of Humāyūn\r\n   Pādshāh:—As my honoured father writes, we did not know until\r\n   we occupied Hindūstān (932 AH.), but afterwards did know, that\r\n   ice does form here and there if there come a colder year. This\r\n   was markedly so in the year I conquered Gujrāt (942 AH.-1535\r\n   AD.) when it was so cold for two or three days between Bhūlpūr\r\n   and Guālīār that the waters were frozen over a hand's\r\n   thickness.\r\n\r\n   [1603] This is a Kakar (Gakkhar) clan, known also as\r\n   Baragowah, of which the location in Jahāngīr Pādshāh's time\r\n   was from Rohtās to Hātya, _i.e._ about where Bābur encamped\r\n   (_Memoirs of Jahāngīr_, Rogers and Beveridge, p. 97; E. and D.\r\n   vi, 309; Provincial Gazetteers of Rawalpindi and Jihlam, p. 64\r\n   and p. 97 respectively).\r\n\r\n   [1604] _āndīn aūtūb_, a reference perhaps to going out beyond\r\n   the corn-lands, perhaps to attempt for more than provisions.\r\n\r\n   [1605] _qūsh-āt_, a led horse to ride in change.\r\n\r\n   [1606] According to Shaikh Zain it was in this year that Bābur\r\n   made Buhlūlpūr a royal domain (B.M. Add. 26,202 f. 16), but\r\n   this does not agree with Bābur's explanation that he visited\r\n   the place because it was _khalṣa_. Its name suggests that it\r\n   had belonged to Buhlūl _Lūdī_; Bābur may have taken it in 930\r\n   AH. when he captured Sīālkot. It never received the population\r\n   of Sīālkot, as Bābur had planned it should do because\r\n   pond-water was drunk in the latter town and was a source of\r\n   disease. The words in which Bābur describes its situation are\r\n   those he uses of Akhsī (f. 4_b_); not improbably a resemblance\r\n   inclined his liking towards Buhlūlpūr. (It may be noted that\r\n   this Buhlūlpūr is mentioned in the _Āyīn-i-akbarī_ and marked\r\n   on large maps, but is not found in the G. of I. 1907.)\r\n\r\n   [1607] Both names are thus spelled in the _Bābur-nāma_. In\r\n   view of the inclination of Turkī to long vowels, Bābur's short\r\n   one in Jat may be worth consideration since modern usage of\r\n   Jat and Jāt varies. Mr. Crooke writes the full vowel, and\r\n   mentions that Jāts are Hindūs, Sikhs, and Muḥammadans (_Tribes\r\n   and Castes of the North-western Provinces and Oude_, iii, 38).\r\n   On this point and on the orthography of the name, Erskine's\r\n   note (_Memoirs_ p. 294) is as follows: \"The Jets or Jats are\r\n   the Muḥammadan peasantry of the Panj-āb, the bank of the\r\n   Indus, Sīwīstān _etc._ and must not be confounded with the\r\n   Jāts, a powerful Hindū tribe to the west of the Jamna, about\r\n   Agra _etc._ and which occupies a subordinate position in the\r\n   country of the Rājpūts.\"\r\n\r\n   [1608] The following section contains a later addition to the\r\n   diary summarizing the action of `Ālam Khān before and after\r\n   Bābur heard of the defeat from the trader he mentions. It\r\n   refutes an opinion found here and there in European writings\r\n   that Bābur used and threw over `Ālam Khān. It and Bābur's\r\n   further narrative shew that `Ālam Khān had little valid\r\n   backing in Hindūstān, that he contributed nothing to Bābur's\r\n   success, and that no abstention by Bābur from attack on\r\n   Ibrāhīm would have set `Ālam Khān on the throne of Dihlī. It\r\n   and other records, Bābur's and those of Afghān chroniclers,\r\n   allow it to be said that if `Ālam Khān had been strong enough\r\n   to accomplish his share of the compact that he should take and\r\n   should rule Dihlī, Bābur would have kept to his share, namely,\r\n   would have maintained supremacy in the Panj-āb. He advanced\r\n   against Ibrāhīm only when `Ālam Khān had totally failed in\r\n   arms and in securing adherence.\r\n\r\n   [1609] This objurgation on over-rapid marching looks like the\r\n   echo of complaint made to Bābur by men of his own whom he had\r\n   given to `Ālam Khān in Kābul.\r\n\r\n   [1610] Maḥmūd himself may have inherited his father's title\r\n   Khān-i-jahān but a little further on he is specifically\r\n   mentioned as the son of Khān-i-jahān, presumably because his\r\n   father had been a more notable man than he was. Of his tribe\r\n   it may be noted that the Ḥaidarābād MS. uniformly writes\r\n   Nuḥānī and not Luḥānī as is usual in European writings, and\r\n   that it does so even when, as on f. 149_b_, the word is\r\n   applied to a trader. Concerning the tribe, family, or caste\r\n   _vide_ G. of I. _s.n._ Lohānas and Crooke _l.c._ _s.n._\r\n   Pathān, para. 21.\r\n\r\n   [1611] _i.e._ west of Dihlī territory, the Panj-āb.\r\n\r\n   [1612] He was of the Farmul family of which Bābur says (f.\r\n   139_b_) that it was in high favour in Hindūstān under the\r\n   Afghāns and of which the author of the _Wāqi`āt-i-mushtāqī_\r\n   says that it held half the lands of Dihlī in _jāgīr_ (E. and\r\n   D. iv, 547).\r\n\r\n   [1613] Presumably he could not cut off supplies.\r\n\r\n   [1614] The only word similar to this that I have found is one\r\n   \"Jaghat\" said to mean serpent and to be the name of a Hindū\r\n   sub-caste of Nats (Crooke, iv, 72 & 73). The word here might\r\n   be a nick-name. Bābur writes it as two words.\r\n\r\n   [1615] _khaṣa-khail_, presumably members of the Sāhū-khail\r\n   (family) of the Lūdī tribe of the Afghān race.\r\n\r\n   [1616] Erskine suggested that this man was a rich banker, but\r\n   he might well be the Farmulī Shaikh-zāda of f. 256_b_, in view\r\n   of the exchange Afghān historians make of the Farmulī title\r\n   Shaikh for Mīān (_Tārīkh-i-sher-shāhī_, E. & D. iv, 347 and\r\n   _Tārīkh-i-daudī_ ib. 457).\r\n\r\n   [1617] This Biban, or Bīban, as Bābur always calls him without\r\n   title, is Malik Biban _Jilwānī_. He was associated with Shaikh\r\n   Bāyazīd _Farmulī_ or, as Afghān writers style him, Mīān\r\n   Bāyazīd _Farmulī_. (Another of his names was Mīān Biban, son\r\n   of Mīān Āṭā _Sāhū-khail_ (E. & D. iv, 347).)\r\n\r\n   [1618] This name occurs so frequently in and about the Panj-āb\r\n   as to suggest that it means a fort (Ar. _maluẕat_?). This one\r\n   in the Siwāliks was founded by Tātār Khān _Yūsuf-khail_\r\n   (_Lūdī_) in the time of Buhlūl _Lūdī_ (E. and D. iv, 415).\r\n\r\n   [1619] In the Beth Jalandhar _dū-āb_.\r\n\r\n   [1620] _i.e._ on the Siwāliks, here locally known as Katār\r\n   Dhār.\r\n\r\n   [1621] Presumably they were from the Hazāra district east of\r\n   the Indus. The _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_ mentions that this\r\n   detachment was acting under Khalīfa apart from Bābur and\r\n   marching through the skirt-hills (lith. ed. p. 182).\r\n\r\n   [1622] _dūn_, f. 260 and note.\r\n\r\n   [1623] These were both refugees from Harāt.\r\n\r\n   [1624] Sarkār of Baṭāla, in the Bārī _dū-āb_ (A.-i-A. Jarrett,\r\n   p. 110).\r\n\r\n   [1625] _kūrūshūr waqt_ (Index _s.n._ _kūrūsh_).\r\n\r\n   [1626] Bābur's phrasing suggests beggary.\r\n\r\n   [1627] This might refer to the time when Ibrāhīm's commander\r\n   Bihār (Bahādur) Khān _Nūḥānī_ took Lāhor (Translator's Note\r\n   _in loco_ p. 441).\r\n\r\n   [1628] They were his father's. Erskine estimated the 3 _krors_\r\n   at £75,000.\r\n\r\n   [1629] _shiqq_, what hangs on either side, perhaps a satirical\r\n   reference to the ass' burden.\r\n\r\n   [1630] As illustrating Bābur's claim to rule as a Tīmūrid in\r\n   Hindūstān, it may be noted that in 814 AH. (1411 AD.), Khiẓr\r\n   Khān who is allowed by the date to have been a Sayyid ruler in\r\n   Dihlī, sent an embassy to Shāhrukh Mīrzā the then Tīmūrid\r\n   ruler of Samarkand to acknowledge his suzerainty\r\n   (_Maṯla`u's-sa`dain_, Quatremère, N. et Ex. xiv, 196).\r\n\r\n   [1631] Firishta says that Bābur mounted for the purpose of\r\n   preserving the honour of the Afghāns and by so doing enabled\r\n   the families in the fort to get out of it safely (lith. ed. p.\r\n   204).\r\n\r\n   [1632] _chuhra_; they will have been of the Corps of braves\r\n   (_yīgīt_; Appendix H. section _c._).\r\n\r\n   [1633] _kīm kullī gharẓ aul aīdī_; Pers. trs. _ka\r\n   gharẓ-i-kullī-i-au būd_.\r\n\r\n   [1634] Persice, the eves of Sunday and Monday; Anglice,\r\n   Saturday and Sunday nights.\r\n\r\n   [1635] Ghāzī Khān was learned and a poet (Firishta ii, 42).\r\n\r\n   [1636] _mullayāna khūd_, perhaps books of learned topic but\r\n   not in choice copies.\r\n\r\n   [1637] f. 257. It stands in 31° 50' N. and 76° E. (G. of I.).\r\n\r\n   [1638] This is on the Salt-range, in 32° 42' N. and 72° 50' E.\r\n   (_Āyīn-i-akbarī_ trs. Jarrett, i, 325; Provincial Gazetteer,\r\n   Jīhlam District).\r\n\r\n   [1639] He died therefore in the town he himself built. Kitta\r\n   Beg probably escorted the Afghān families from Milwat also;\r\n   Dilāwar Khān's own seems to have been there already (f. 257).\r\n\r\n   The _Bābur-nāma_ makes no mention of Daulat Khān's relations\r\n   with Nānak, the founder of the Sikh religion, nor does it\r\n   mention Nānak himself. A tradition exists that Nānak, when on\r\n   his travels, made exposition of his doctrines to an attentive\r\n   Bābur and that he was partly instrumental in bringing Bābur\r\n   against the Afghāns. He was 12 years older than Bābur and\r\n   survived him nine. (Cf. _Dabistān_ lith. ed. p. 270; and, for\r\n   Jahāngīr Pādshāh's notice of Daulat Khān, _Tūzūk-i-jahāngīrī_,\r\n   Rogers and Beveridge, p. 87).\r\n\r\n   [1640] I translate _dūn_ by _dale_ because, as its equivalent,\r\n   Bābur uses _julga_ by which he describes a more pastoral\r\n   valley than one he calls a _dara_.\r\n\r\n   [1641] _bīr āqār-sū._ Bābur's earlier uses of this term\r\n   [_q.v._ index] connect it with the swift flow of water in\r\n   irrigation channels; this may be so here but also the term may\r\n   make distinction between the rapid mountain-stream and the\r\n   slow movement of rivers across plains.\r\n\r\n   [1642] There are two readings of this sentence; Erskine's\r\n   implies that the neck of land connecting the fort-rock with\r\n   its adjacent hill measures 7-8 _qārī_ (yards) from side to\r\n   side; de Courteille's that where the great gate was, the\r\n   perpendicular fall surrounding the fort shallowed to 7-8\r\n   yards. The Turkī might be read, I think, to mean whichever\r\n   alternative was the fact. Erskine's reading best bears out\r\n   Bābur's account of the strength of the fort, since it allows\r\n   of a cleft between the hill and the fort some 140-160 feet\r\n   deep, as against the 21-24 of de Courteille's. Erskine may\r\n   have been in possession of information [in 1826] by which he\r\n   guided his translation (p. 300), \"At its chief gate, for the\r\n   space of 7 or 8 _gez_ (_qārī_), there is a place that admits\r\n   of a draw-bridge being thrown across; it may be 10 or 12 _gez_\r\n   wide.\" If de Courteille's reading be correct in taking 7-8\r\n   _qārī_ only to be the depth of the cleft, that cleft may be\r\n   artificial.\r\n\r\n   [1643] _yīghāch_, which also means wood.\r\n\r\n   [1644] f. 257.\r\n\r\n   [1645] Chief scribe (f. 13 n. to `Abdu'l-wahhāb). Shaw's\r\n   Vocabulary explains the word as meaning also a \"high official\r\n   of Central Asian sovereigns, who is supreme over all _qāzīs_\r\n   and _mullās_.\"\r\n\r\n   [1646] Bābur's persistent interest in Balkh attracts\r\n   attention, especially at this time so shortly before he does\r\n   not include it as part of his own territories (f. 270).\r\n\r\n   Since I wrote of Balkh _s.a._ 923 AH. (1517 AD.), I have\r\n   obtained the following particulars about it in that year; they\r\n   are summarized from the _Ḥabību's-siyar_ (lith. ed. iii, 371).\r\n   In 923 AH. Khwānd-amīr was in retirement at Pasht in\r\n   Ghūrjistān where also was Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā. The two went\r\n   in company to Balkh where the Mīrzā besieged Bābur's man\r\n   Ibrāhīm _chāpūk_ (Slash-face), and treacherously murdered one\r\n   Aūrdū-shāh, an envoy sent out to parley with him. Information\r\n   of what was happening was sent to Bābur in Kābul. Bābur\r\n   reached Balkh when it had been besieged a month. His presence\r\n   caused the Mīrzā to retire and led him to go into the\r\n   Darā-i-gaz (Tamarind-valley). Bābur, placing in Balkh\r\n   Faqīr-i-`alī, one of those just come up with him, followed the\r\n   Mīrzā but turned back at Āq-guṃbaz (White-dome) which lies\r\n   between Chāch-charān in the Herī-rūd valley and the Ghūrjistān\r\n   border, going no further because the Ghūrjistānīs favoured the\r\n   Mīrzā. Bābur went back to Kābul by the Fīrūz-koh, Yaka-aūlāng\r\n   (cf. f. 195) and Ghūr; the Mīrzā was followed up by others,\r\n   captured and conveyed to Kābul.\r\n\r\n   [1647] Both were amīrs of Hind. I understand the cognomen\r\n   Maẕhab to imply that its bearer occupied himself with the\r\n   Muḥammadan Faith in its exposition by divines of Islām\r\n   (_Hughes' Dictionary of Islām_).\r\n\r\n   [1648] These incidents are included in the summary of `Ālam\r\n   Khān's affairs in section _i_ (f. 255_b_). It will be observed\r\n   that Bābur's wording implies the \"waiting\" by one of lower\r\n   rank on a superior.\r\n\r\n   [1649] Elph. MS. Karnāl, obviously a clerical error.\r\n\r\n   [1650] Shaikh Sulaimān Effendi (Kunos) describes a _tunqiṯār_\r\n   as the guardian in war of a prince's tent; a night-guard; and\r\n   as one who repeats a prayer aloud while a prince is mounting.\r\n\r\n   [1651] _rūd_, which, inappropriate for the lower course of the\r\n   Ghaggar, may be due to Bābur's visit to its upper course\r\n   described immediately below. As has been noted, however, he\r\n   uses the word _rūd_ to describe the empty bed of a\r\n   mountain-stream as well as the swift water sometimes filling\r\n   that bed. The account, here-following, of his visit to the\r\n   upper course of the Ghaggar is somewhat difficult to\r\n   translate.\r\n\r\n   [1652] _Hindūstāndā daryālārdīn bāshqa, bīr āqār-sū kīm bār_\r\n   (_dūr_, is added by the Elph. MS.), _bū dūr_. Perhaps the\r\n   meaning is that the one (chief?) irrigation stream, apart from\r\n   great rivers, is the Ghaggar. The bed of the Ghaggar is\r\n   undefined and the water is consumed for irrigation (G. of I.\r\n   xx, 33; Index _s.n._ _āqār-sū_).\r\n\r\n   [1653] in Patiāla. Maps show what may be Bābur's strong\r\n   millstream joining the Ghaggar.\r\n\r\n   [1654] Presumably he was of Ibrāhīm's own family, the\r\n   Sāhū-khail. His defeat was opportune because he was on his way\r\n   to join the main army.\r\n\r\n   [1655] At this place the Elphinstone Codex has preserved,\r\n   interpolated in its text, a note of Humāyūn's on his first use\r\n   of the razor. Part of it is written as by Bābur:—\"Today in\r\n   this same camp the razor or scissors was applied to Humāyūn's\r\n   face.\" Part is signed by Humāyūn:—\"As the honoured dead,\r\n   earlier in these Acts (_wāqi`āt_) mentions the first\r\n   application of the razor to his own face (f. 120), so in\r\n   imitation of him I mention this. I was then at the age of 18;\r\n   now I am at the age of 48, I who am the sub-signed Muḥammad\r\n   Humāyūn.\" A scribe's note attests that this is \"copied from\r\n   the hand-writing of that honoured one\". As Humāyūn's 48th\r\n   (lunar) birthday occurred a month before he left Kābul, to\r\n   attempt the re-conquest of Hindūstān, in November 1554 AD. (in\r\n   the last month of 961 AH.), he was still 48 (lunar) years old\r\n   on the day he re-entered Dihlī on July 23rd 1555 AD. (Ramẓān\r\n   1st 962 AH.), so that this \"shaving passage\" will have been\r\n   entered within those dates. That he should study his Father's\r\n   book at that time is natural; his grandson Jahāngīr did the\r\n   same when going to Kābul; so doubtless would do its author's\r\n   more remote descendants, the sons of Shāh-jahān who\r\n   reconquered Transoxiana.\r\n\r\n   (Concerning the \"shaving passage\" _vide_ the notes on the\r\n   Elphinstone Codex in JRAS. 1900 p. 443, 451; 1902 p. 653; 1905\r\n   p. 754; and 1907 p. 131.)\r\n\r\n   [1656] This ancient town of the Sahāranpūr district is\r\n   associated with a saint revered by Hindūs and Muḥammadans. Cf.\r\n   W. Crooke's _Popular Religion of Northern India_ p. 133. Its\r\n   _chashma_ may be inferred (from Bābur's uses of the word\r\n   _q.v._ Index) as a water-head, a pool, a gathering place of\r\n   springs.\r\n\r\n   [1657] He was the eighth son of Bābur's maternal-uncle Sl.\r\n   Aḥmad Khān _Chaghatāī_ and had fled to Bābur, other brothers\r\n   following him, from the service of their eldest brother\r\n   Manṣūr, Khāqān of the Mughūls (_Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_ trs. p.\r\n   161).\r\n\r\n   [1658] _fars̱-waqtī_, when there is light enough to\r\n   distinguish one object from another.\r\n\r\n   [1659] _dīm kūrūldī_ (Index _s.n._ _dīm_). Here the L. & E.\r\n   _Memoirs_ inserts an explanatory passage in Persian about the\r\n   _dīm_. It will have been in one of the _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī MSS._\r\n   Erskine used; it is in Muḥ. _Shīrāzī_'s lithograph copy of the\r\n   Udaipūr Codex (p. 173). It is not in the Turkī text or in all\r\n   the MSS. of the Persian translation. Manifestly, it was\r\n   entered at a time when Bābur's term _dīm kūrūldī_ requires\r\n   explanation in Hindustan. The writer of it himself does not\r\n   make details clear; he says only, \"It is manifest that people\r\n   declare (the number) after counting the mounted army in the\r\n   way agreed upon amongst them, with a whip or a bow held in the\r\n   hand.\" This explanation suggests that in the march-past the\r\n   troops were measured off as so many bow- or whip-lengths\r\n   (Index _s.n._ _dīm_).\r\n\r\n   [1660] These _arāba_ may have been the baggage-carts of the\r\n   army and also carts procured on the spot. Erskine omits\r\n   (_Memoirs_ p. 304) the words which show how many carts were\r\n   collected and from whom. Doubtless it would be through not\r\n   having these circumstances in his mind that he took the\r\n   _arāba_ for gun-carriages. His incomplete translation, again,\r\n   led Stanley Lane-Poole to write an interesting note in his\r\n   _Bābur_ (p. 161) to support Erskine against de Courteille\r\n   (with whose rendering mine agrees) by quoting the circumstance\r\n   that Humāyūn had 700 guns at Qanauj in 1540 AD. It must be\r\n   said in opposition to his support of Erskine's \"gun-carriages\"\r\n   that there is no textual or circumstantial warrant for\r\n   supposing Bābur to have had guns, even if made in parts, in\r\n   such number as to demand 700 gun-carriages for their\r\n   transport. What guns Bābur had at Pānī-pat will have been\r\n   brought from his Kābul base; if he had acquired any, say from\r\n   Lāhor, he would hardly omit to mention such an important\r\n   reinforcement of his armament; if he had brought many guns on\r\n   carts from Kābul, he must have met with transit-difficulties\r\n   harassing enough to chronicle, while he was making that long\r\n   journey from Kābul to Pānī-pat, over passes, through\r\n   skirt-hills and many fords. The elephants he had in Bīgrām may\r\n   have been his transport for what guns he had; he does not\r\n   mention his number at Pānī-pat; he makes his victory a\r\n   bow-man's success; he can be read as indicating that he had\r\n   two guns only.\r\n\r\n   [1661] These Ottoman (text, _Rūmī_, Roman) defences Ustād\r\n   `Alī-qulī may have seen at the battle of Chāldirān fought some\r\n   40 leagues from Tābrīz between Sl. Salīm _Rūmī_ and Shāh\r\n   Ismā`īl _Ṣafawī_ on Rajab 1st 920 AH. (Aug. 22nd 1514 AD.). Of\r\n   this battle Khwānd-amīr gives a long account, dwelling on the\r\n   effective use made in it of chained carts and palisades\r\n   (_Ḥabību's-siyar_ iii, part 4, p. 78; _Akbar-nāma_ trs. i,\r\n   241).\r\n\r\n   [1662] Is this the village of the Pānī Afghāns?\r\n\r\n   [1663] Index _s.n._ arrow.\r\n\r\n   [1664] _Pareshān jam`ī u jam`ī pareshān;\r\n          Giriftār qaumī u qaumī `ajā'ib._\r\n\r\n   These two lines do not translate easily without the context of\r\n   their original place of occurrence. I have not found their\r\n   source.\r\n\r\n   [1665] _i.e._ of his father and grandfather, Sikandar and\r\n   Buhlūl.\r\n\r\n   [1666] As to the form of this word the authoritative MSS. of\r\n   the Turkī text agree and with them also numerous good ones of\r\n   the Persian translation. I have made careful examination of\r\n   the word because it is replaced or explained here and there in\r\n   MSS. by _s:hb:ndī_, the origin of which is said to be obscure.\r\n   The sense of _b:d-hindī_ and of _s:hb:ndī_ is the same, _i.e._\r\n   irregular levy. The word as Bābur wrote it must have been\r\n   understood by earlier Indian scribes of both the Turkī and\r\n   Persian texts of the _Bābur-nāma_. Some light on its\r\n   correctness may be thought given by Hobson Jobson (Crooke's\r\n   ed. p. 136) _s.n._ Byde or Bede Horse, where the word Byde is\r\n   said to be an equivalent of _pindārī_, _lūtī_, and _qāzzāq_,\r\n   raider, plunderer, so that Bābur's word _b:d-hindī_ may mean\r\n   _qāzzāq_ of Hind. Wherever I have referred to the word in many\r\n   MSS. it is pointed to read _b:d_, and not _p:d_, thus\r\n   affording no warrant for understanding _pad_, foot, foot-man,\r\n   infantry, and also negativing the spelling _bīd_, _i.e._ with\r\n   a long vowel as in _Byde_.\r\n\r\n   It may be noted here that Muḥ. _Shīrāzī_ (p. 174) substituted\r\n   _s:hb:ndī_ for Bābur's word and that this led our friend the\r\n   late William Irvine to attribute mistake to de Courteille who\r\n   follows the Turkī text (_Army of the Mughūls_ p. 66 and\r\n   _Mémoires_ ii, 163).\r\n\r\n   [1667] _bī tajarba yīgīt aīdī_ of which the sense may be that\r\n   Bābur ranked Ibrāhīm, as a soldier, with a brave who has not\r\n   yet proved himself deserving of the rank of beg. It cannot\r\n   mean that he was a youth (_yīgīt_) without experience of\r\n   battle.\r\n\r\n   [1668] Well-known are the three decisive historical battles\r\n   fought near the town of Pānī-pat, _viz._ those of Bābur and\r\n   Ibrāhīm in 1526, of Akbar and Hīmū in 1556, and of Aḥmad\r\n   _Abdālī_ with the Mahratta Confederacy in 1761. The following\r\n   lesser particulars about the battle-field are not so\r\n   frequently mentioned:—(_i_) that the scene of Bābur's victory\r\n   was long held to be haunted, Badāyūnī himself, passing it at\r\n   dawn some 62 years later, heard with dismay the din of\r\n   conflict and the shouts of the combatants; (_ii_) that Bābur\r\n   built a (perhaps commemorative) mosque one mile to the n.e. of\r\n   the town; (_iii_) that one of the unaccomplished desires of\r\n   Sher Shāh _Sūr_, the conqueror of Bābur's son Humāyūn, was to\r\n   raise two monuments on the battle-field of Pānī-pat, one to\r\n   Ibrāhīm, the other to those Chaghatāī sulṯāns whose martyrdom\r\n   he himself had brought about; (_iv_) that in 1910 AD. the\r\n   British Government placed a monument to mark the scene of Shāh\r\n   _Abdālī's_ victory of 1761 AD. This monument would appear,\r\n   from Sayyid Ghulām-i-`alī's _Nigār-nāma-i-hind_, to stand\r\n   close to the scene of Bābur's victory also, since the\r\n   Mahrattas were entrenched as he was outside the town of\r\n   Pānī-pat. (Cf. E. & D. viii, 401.)\r\n\r\n   [1669] This important date is omitted from the L. & E.\r\n   _Memoirs_.\r\n\r\n   [1670] This wording will cover armour of man and horse.\r\n\r\n   [1671] _ātlāndūk_, Pers. trs. _sūwār shudīm_. Some later\r\n   oriental writers locate Bābur's battle at two or more miles\r\n   from the town of Pānī-pat, and Bābur's word _ātlāndūk_ might\r\n   imply that his cavalry rode forth and arrayed outside his\r\n   defences, but his narrative allows of his delivering attack,\r\n   through the wide sally-ports, after arraying behind the carts\r\n   and mantelets which checked his adversary's swift advance. The\r\n   Mahrattas, who may have occupied the same ground as Bābur,\r\n   fortified themselves more strongly than he did, as having\r\n   powerful artillery against them. Aḥmad Shāh _Abdālī's_ defence\r\n   against them was an ordinary ditch and _abbattis_, [Bābur's\r\n   ditch and branch,] mostly of _dhāk_ trees (_Butea frondosa_),\r\n   a local product Bābur also is likely to have used.\r\n\r\n   [1672] The preceding three words seem to distinguish this Shāh\r\n   Ḥusain from several others of his name and may imply that he\r\n   was the son of _Yāragī Mughūl Ghānchī_ (Index and I.O. 217 f.\r\n   184b l. 7).\r\n\r\n   [1673] For Bābur's terms _vide_ f. 209_b_\r\n\r\n   [1674] This is Mīrzā Khān's son, _i.e._ Wais _Mīrān-shāhī's_.\r\n\r\n   [1675] A dispute for this right-hand post of honour is\r\n   recorded on f. 100_b_, as also in accounts of Culloden.\r\n\r\n   [1676] _tartīb u yāsāl_, which may include, as Erskine took it\r\n   to do, the carts and mantelets; of these however, Ibrāhīm can\r\n   hardly have failed to hear before he rode out of camp.\r\n\r\n   [1677] f. 217_b_ and note; Irvine's _Army of the Indian\r\n   Mughuls_ p. 133. Here Erskine notes (_Mems._ p. 306) \"The size\r\n   of these artillery at this time is very uncertain. The word\r\n   _firingī_ is now (1826 AD.) used in the Deccan for a swivel.\r\n   At the present day, _zarb-zan_ in common usage is a small\r\n   species of swivel. Both words in Bābur's time appear to have\r\n   been used for field-cannon.\" (For an account of guns,\r\n   intermediate in date between Bābur and Erskine, _see_ the\r\n   _Āyīn-i-akbarī_. Cf. f. 264 n. on the carts (_arāba_).)\r\n\r\n   [1678] Although the authority of the\r\n   _Tārīkh-i-salāṯīn-i-afaghāna_ is not weighty its reproduction\r\n   of Afghān opinion is worth consideration. It says that\r\n   astrologers foretold Ibrāhīm's defeat; that his men, though\r\n   greatly outnumbering Bābur's, were out-of-heart through his\r\n   ill-treatment of them, and his amīrs in displeasure against\r\n   him, but that never-the-less, the conflict at Pānī-pat was\r\n   more desperate than had ever been seen. It states that Ibrāhīm\r\n   fell where his tomb now is (_i.e._ in _circa_ 1002 AH.-1594\r\n   AD.); that Bābur went to the spot and, prompted by his tender\r\n   heart, lifted up the head of his dead adversary, and said,\r\n   \"Honour to your courage!\", ordered brocade and sweetmeats made\r\n   ready, enjoined Dilāwar Khān and Khalīfa to bathe the corpse\r\n   and to bury it where it lay (E. & D. v, 2). Naturally, part of\r\n   the reverence shewn to the dead would be the burial together\r\n   of head and trunk.\r\n\r\n   [1679] f. 209_b_ and App. H. section _c._ Bābā _chuhra_ would\r\n   be one of the corps of braves.\r\n\r\n   [1680] He was a brother of Muḥibb-i-`alī's mother.\r\n\r\n   [1681] To give Humāyūn the title Mīrzā may be a scribe's\r\n   lapse, but might also be a _nuance_ of Bābur's, made to shew,\r\n   with other _minutiae_, that Humāyūn was in chief command. The\r\n   other minute matters are that instead of Humāyūn's name being\r\n   the first of a simple series of commanders' names with the\r\n   enclitic accusative appended to the last one (here Walī), as\r\n   is usual, Humāyūn's name has its own enclitic _nī_; and,\r\n   again, the phrase is \"_Humāyūn with_\" such and such begs, a\r\n   turn of expression differentiating him from the rest. The same\r\n   unusual variations occur again, just below, perhaps with the\r\n   same intention of shewing chief command, there of Mahdī\r\n   Khwāja.\r\n\r\n   [1682] A small matter of wording attracts attention in the\r\n   preceding two sentences. Bābur, who does not always avoid\r\n   verbal repetition, here constructs two sentences which, except\r\n   for the place-names Dihlī and Āgra, convey information of\r\n   precisely the same action in entirely different words.\r\n\r\n   [1683] d. 1325 AD. The places Bābur visited near Dihlī are\r\n   described in the _Reports of the Indian Archaeological\r\n   Survey_, in Sayyid Aḥmad's _As̤ār Sanādīd_ pp. 74-85, in\r\n   Keene's _Hand-book to Dihlī_ and Murray's _Hand-book to Bengal\r\n   etc._ The last two quote much from the writings of Cunningham\r\n   and Fergusson.\r\n\r\n   [1684] and on the same side of the river.\r\n\r\n   [1685] d. 1235 AD. He was a native of Aūsh [Ush] in Farghāna.\r\n\r\n   [1686] d. 1286 AD. He was a Slave ruler of Dihlī.\r\n\r\n   [1687] `Alāu'u'd-dīn Muḥ. Shāh _Khiljī Turk_ d. 1316 AD. It is\r\n   curious that Bābur should specify visiting his Minār\r\n   (_minārī_, Pers. trs. I.O. 217 f. 185_b_, _minār-i-au_) and\r\n   not mention the Quṯb Minār. Possibly he confused the two. The\r\n   `Alāī Minār remains unfinished; the Quṯb is judged by\r\n   Cunningham to have been founded by Quṯbu'd-dīn Aībak _Turk_,\r\n   _circa_ 1200 AD. and to have been completed by Sl.\r\n   Shamsu'd-dīn Altamsh (Aīltimīsh?) _Turk_, _circa_ 1220 AD. Of\r\n   the two tanks Bābur visited, the Royal-tank (_ḥauẓ-i-khāẓ_)\r\n   was made by `Alāu'u'd-dīn in 1293 AD.\r\n\r\n   [1688] The familiar Turkī word Tūghlūq would reinforce much\r\n   else met with in Dihlī to strengthen Bābur's opinion that, as\r\n   a Turk, he had a right to rule there. Many, if not all, of the\r\n   Slave dynasty were Turks; these were followed by the Khiljī\r\n   Turks, these again by the Tūghlūqs. Moreover the Panj-āb he\r\n   had himself taken, and lands on both sides of the Indus\r\n   further south had been ruled by Ghaznawid Turks. His latest\r\n   conquests were \"where the Turk had ruled\" (f. 226_b_) long,\r\n   wide, and with interludes only of non-Turkī sway.\r\n\r\n   [1689] Perhaps this charity was the _Khams_ (Fifth) due from a\r\n   victor.\r\n\r\n   [1690] Bikramājīt was a Tūnūr Rājpūt. Bābur's unhesitating\r\n   statement of the Hindu's destination at death may be called a\r\n   fruit of conviction, rather than of what modern opinion calls\r\n   intolerance.\r\n\r\n   [1691] 120 years (Cunningham's _Report of the Archaeological\r\n   Survey_ ii, 330 _et seq._).\r\n\r\n   [1692] The _Tārīkh-i-sher-shāhī_ tells a good deal about the\r\n   man who bore this title, and also about others who found\r\n   themselves now in difficulty between Ibrāhīm's tyranny and\r\n   Bābur's advance (E. & D. iv, 301).\r\n\r\n   [1693] Gūālīār was taken from Bikramājīt in 1518 AD.\r\n\r\n   [1694] _i.e._ from the Deccan of which `Alāu'u'd-dīn is said\r\n   to have been the first Muḥammadan invader. An account of this\r\n   diamond, identified as the Koh-i-nūr, is given in _Hobson\r\n   Jobson_ but its full history is not told by Yule or by\r\n   Streeter's _Great Diamonds of the World_, neither mentioning\r\n   the presentation of the diamond by Humāyūn to Taḥmāsp of which\r\n   Abū'l-faẓl writes, dwelling on its overplus of payment for all\r\n   that Humāyūn in exile received from his Persian host\r\n   (_Akbar-nāma_ trs. i, 349 and note; _Asiatic Quarterly\r\n   Review_, April 1899 H. Beveridge's art. _Bābur's diamond_;\r\n   _was it the Koh-i-nūr?_).\r\n\r\n   [1695] 320 _ratīs_ (Erskine). The _ratī_ is 2.171 Troy grains,\r\n   or in picturesque primitive equivalents, is 8 grains of rice,\r\n   or 64 mustard seeds, or 512 poppy-seeds,—uncertain weights\r\n   which Akbar fixed in cat's-eye stones.\r\n\r\n   [1696] Bābur's plurals allow the supposition that the three\r\n   men's lives were spared. Malik Dād served him thenceforth.\r\n\r\n   [1697] Erskine estimated these as _dams_ and worth about\r\n   £1750, but this may be an underestimate (_H. of I._ i, App.\r\n   E.).\r\n\r\n   [1698] \"These begs of his\" (or hers) may be the three written\r\n   of above.\r\n\r\n   [1699] These will include cousins and his half-brothers\r\n   Jahāngīr and Nāṣir as opposing before he took action in 925\r\n   AH. (1519 AD.). The time between 910 AH. and 925 AH. at which\r\n   he would most desire Hindūstān is after 920 AH. in which year\r\n   he returned defeated from Transoxiana.\r\n\r\n   [1700] _kīchīk karīm_, which here seems to make contrast\r\n   between the ruling birth of members of his own family and the\r\n   lower birth of even great begs still with him. Where the\r\n   phrase occurs on f. 295, Erskine renders it by \"down to the\r\n   dregs\", and de Courteille (ii, 235) by \"_de toutes les\r\n   bouches_\" but neither translation appears to me to suit\r\n   Bābur's uses of the term, inasmuch as both seem to go too low\r\n   (cf. f. 270_b_).\r\n\r\n   [1701] _aīūrūshūb_, Pers. trs. _chaspīda_, stuck to.\r\n\r\n   [1702] The first expedition is fixed by the preceding passage\r\n   as in 925 AH. which was indeed the first time a passage of the\r\n   Indus is recorded. Three others are found recorded, those of\r\n   926, 930 and 932 AH. Perhaps the fifth was not led by Bābur in\r\n   person, and may be that of his troops accompanying `Ālam Khān\r\n   in 931 AH. But he may count into the set of five, the one made\r\n   in 910 AH. which he himself meant to cross the Indus. Various\r\n   opinions are found expressed by European writers as to the\r\n   dates of the five.\r\n\r\n   [1703] Muḥammad died 632 AD. (11 AH.).\r\n\r\n   [1704] Tramontana, n. of Hindū-kush. For particulars about the\r\n   dynasties mentioned by Bābur see Stanley Lane-Poole's\r\n   _Muḥammadan Dynasties_.\r\n\r\n   [1705] Maḥmūd of Ghaznī, a Turk by race, d. 1030 AD. (421\r\n   AH.).\r\n\r\n   [1706] known as Muḥ. _Ghūrī_, d. 1206 AD. (602 AH.).\r\n\r\n   [1707] _sūrūbtūrlār_, lit. drove them like sheep (cf. f.\r\n   154b).\r\n\r\n   [1708] _khūd_, itself, not Bābur's only Hibernianism.\r\n\r\n   [1709] \"This is an excellent history of the Musalmān world\r\n   down to the time of Sl. Nāṣir of Dihlī A.D. 1252. It was\r\n   written by Abū `Umar Minḥāj al Jūrjānī. See Stewart's\r\n   catalogue of Tipoo's Library, p. 7\" (Erskine). It has been\r\n   translated by Raverty.\r\n\r\n   [1710] _bargustwān-wār_; Erskine, cataphract horse.\r\n\r\n   [1711] The numerous instances of the word _pādshāh_ in this\r\n   part of the _Bābur-nāma_ imply no such distinction as attaches\r\n   to the title Emperor by which it is frequently translated\r\n   (Index _s.n._ _pādshāh_).\r\n\r\n   [1712] d. 1500 AD. (905 AH.).\r\n\r\n   [1713] d. 1388 AD. (790 AH.).\r\n\r\n   [1714] The ancestor mentioned appears to be Naṣrat Shāh, a\r\n   grandson of Fīrūz Shāh _Tūghlūq_ (S. L. Poole p. 300 and\r\n   Beale, 298).\r\n\r\n   [1715] His family belonged to the Rājpūt sept of Tānk, and had\r\n   become Muḥammadan in the person of Sadharān the first ruler of\r\n   Gujrāt (Crooke's _Tribes and Castes; Mirāt-i-sikandarī_,\r\n   Bayley p. 67 and n.).\r\n\r\n   [1716] S. L.-Poole p. 316-7.\r\n\r\n   [1717] Mandāū (Mandū) was the capital of Malwā.\r\n\r\n   [1718] Stanley Lane-Poole shews (p. 311) a dynasty of three\r\n   Ghūrīs interposed between the death of Fīrūz Shāh in 790 AH.\r\n   and the accession in 839 AH. of the first Khiljī ruler of\r\n   Gujrāt Maḥmūd Shāh.\r\n\r\n   [1719] He reigned from 1518 to 1532 AD. (925 to 939 AH.\r\n   S.L.-P. p. 308) and had to wife a daughter of Ibrāhīm _Lūdī_\r\n   (_Riyaẓu's-salāṯīn_). His dynasty was known as the\r\n   Ḥusain-shāhī, after his father.\r\n\r\n   [1720] \"Strange as this custom may seem, a similar one\r\n   prevailed down to a very late period in Malabar. There was a\r\n   jubilee every 12 years in the Samorin's country, and any-one\r\n   who succeeded in forcing his way through the Samorin's guards\r\n   and slew him, reigned in his stead. 'A jubilee is proclaimed\r\n   throughout his dominions at the end of 12 years, and a tent is\r\n   pitched for him in a spacious plain, and a great feast is\r\n   celebrated for 10 or 12 days with mirth and jollity, guns\r\n   firing night and day, so, at the end of the feast, any four of\r\n   the guests that have a mind to gain a throne by a desperate\r\n   action in fighting their way through 30 or 40,000 of his\r\n   guards, and kill the Samorin in his tent, he that kills him,\r\n   succeeds him in his empire.' See Hamilton's _New Account of\r\n   the East Indies_ vol. i. p. 309. The attempt was made in 1695,\r\n   and again a very few years ago, but without success\" (Erskine\r\n   p. 311).\r\n\r\n   The custom Bābur writes of—it is one dealt with at length in\r\n   Frazer's _Golden Bough_—would appear from Blochmann's\r\n   _Geography and History of Bengal_ (JASB 1873 p. 286) to have\r\n   been practised by the Habshī rulers of Bengal of whom he\r\n   quotes Faria y Souza as saying, \"They observe no rule of\r\n   inheritance from father to son, but even slaves sometimes\r\n   obtain it by killing their master, and whoever holds it three\r\n   days, they look upon as established by divine providence. Thus\r\n   it fell out that in 40 years space they had 13 kings\r\n   successively.\"\r\n\r\n   [1721] No doubt this represents Vijāyanagar in the Deccan.\r\n\r\n   [1722] This date places the composition of the _Description of\r\n   Hindustan_ in agreement with Shaikh Zain's statement that it\r\n   was in writing in 935 AH.\r\n\r\n   [1723] Are they the Khas of Nepal and Sikkim? (G. of I.).\r\n\r\n   [1724] Here Erskine notes that the Persian (trs.) adds, \"_mīr_\r\n   signifying a hill, and _kas_ being the name of the natives of\r\n   the hill-country.\" This may not support the name _kas_ as\r\n   correct but may be merely an explanation of Bābur's meaning.\r\n   It is not in I.O. 217 f. 189 or in Muḥ. _Shīrāzī_'s\r\n   lithographed _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_ p. 190.\r\n\r\n   [1725] Either yak or the tassels of the yak. See Appendix M.\r\n\r\n   [1726] My husband tells me that Bābur's authority for this\r\n   interpretation of Sawālak may be the _Z̤afar-nāma_ (Bib. Ind.\r\n   ed. ii, 149).\r\n\r\n   [1727] _i.e._ the countries of Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n   [1728] so pointed, carefully, in the Ḥai. MS. Mr. Erskine\r\n   notes of these rivers that they are the Indus, Hydaspes,\r\n   Ascesines, Hydraotes, Hesudrus and Hyphasis.\r\n\r\n   [1729] _Āyīn-i-akbarī_, Jarrett 279.\r\n\r\n   [1730] _pārcha pārcha_, _kīchīkrāk kīchīkrāk_, _āndā mūndā_,\r\n   _tāshlīq tāqghīna_. The Gazetteer of India (1907 i, 1) puts\r\n   into scientific words, what Bābur here describes, the ruin of\r\n   a great former range.\r\n\r\n   [1731] Here _āqār-sūlār_ might safely be replaced by\r\n   \"irrigation channels\" (Index _s.n._).\r\n\r\n   [1732] The verb here is _tāshmāq_; it also expresses to carry\r\n   like ants (f. 220), presumably from each person's carrying a\r\n   pitcher or a stone at a time, and repeatedly.\r\n\r\n   [1733] \"This\" notes Erskine (p. 315) \"is the _wulsa_ or\r\n   _walsa_, so well described by Colonel Wilks in his Historical\r\n   Sketches vol. i. p. 309, note 'On the approach of an hostile\r\n   army, the unfortunate inhabitants of India bury under ground\r\n   their most cumbrous effects, and each individual, man, woman,\r\n   and child above six years of age (the infant children being\r\n   carried by their mothers), with a load of grain proportioned\r\n   to their strength, issue from their beloved homes, and take\r\n   the direction of a country (if such can be found,) exempt from\r\n   the miseries of war; sometimes of a strong fortress, but more\r\n   generally of the most unfrequented hills and woods, where they\r\n   prolong a miserable existence until the departure of the\r\n   enemy, and if this should be protracted beyond the time for\r\n   which they have provided food, a large portion necessarily\r\n   dies of hunger.' See the note itself. The Historical Sketches\r\n   should be read by every-one who desires to have an accurate\r\n   idea of the South of India. It is to be regretted that we do\r\n   not possess the history of any other part of India, written\r\n   with the same knowledge or research.\"\r\n\r\n   \"The word _wulsa_ or _walsa_ is Dravidian. Telugu has\r\n   _valasa_, 'emigration, flight, or removing from home for fear\r\n   of a hostile army.' Kanarese has _valasĕ_, _ŏlasĕ_, and\r\n   _ŏlisĕ_, 'flight, a removing from home for fear of a hostile\r\n   army.' Tamil has _valasei_, 'flying for fear, removing\r\n   hastily.' The word is an interesting one. I feel pretty sure\r\n   it is not Aryan, but Dravidian; and yet it stands alone in\r\n   Dravidian, with nothing that I can find in the way of a root\r\n   or affinities to explain its etymology. Possibly it may be a\r\n   borrowed word in Dravidian. Malayalam has no corresponding\r\n   word. Can it have been borrowed from Kolarian or other\r\n   primitive Indian speech?\" (Letter to H. Beveridge from Mr. F.\r\n   E. Pargiter, 8th August, 1914.)\r\n\r\n   _Wulsa_ seems to be a derivative from Sanscrit _ūlvash_, and\r\n   to answer to Persian _wairānī_ and Turkī _būzūghlūghī_.\r\n\r\n   [1734] _lalmī_, which in Afghānī (Pushtū) signifies grown\r\n   without irrigation.\r\n\r\n   [1735] \"The improvement of Hindūstān since Bābur's time must\r\n   be prodigious. The wild elephant is now confined to the\r\n   forests under Hemāla, and to the Ghats of Malabar. A wild\r\n   elephant near Karrah, Mānikpūr, or Kālpī, is a thing, at the\r\n   present day (1826 AD.), totally unknown. May not their\r\n   familiar existence in these countries down to Bābur's days, be\r\n   considered rather hostile to the accounts given of the\r\n   superabundant population of Hindūstān in remote times?\"\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1736] _dīwān._ I.O. 217 f. 190b, _dar dīwān fīl jawāb\r\n   mīgūīnd_; Mems. p. 316. They account to the government for the\r\n   elephants they take; _Méms._ ii, 188, _Les habitants payent\r\n   l'impôt avec le produit de leur chasse_. Though de\r\n   Courteille's reading probably states the fact, Erskine's\r\n   includes de C.'s and more, inasmuch as it covers all captures\r\n   and these might reach to a surplusage over the imposts.\r\n\r\n   [1737] Pers. trs. _gaz_=24 inches. _Il est bon de rappeler que\r\n   le mot turk qārī, que la version persane rend par gaz, désigne\r\n   proprement l'espace compris entre le haut de l'épaule jusqu'au\r\n   bout des doigts_ (de Courteille, ii, 189 note). The _qārī_\r\n   like one of its equivalents, the ell (Zenker), is a variable\r\n   measure; it seems to approach more nearly to a yard than to a\r\n   _gaz_ of 24 inches. See _Memoirs of Jahāngīr_ (R. & B. pp. 18,\r\n   141 and notes) for the heights of elephants, and for\r\n   discussion of some measures.\r\n\r\n   [1738] _khūd_, itself.\r\n\r\n   [1739] _i.e._ pelt; as Erskine notes, its skin is scattered\r\n   with small hairs. Details such as this one stir the question,\r\n   for whom was Bābur writing? Not for Hindūstān where what he\r\n   writes is patent; hardly for Kābul; perhaps for Transoxiana.\r\n\r\n   [1740] Shaikh Zain's wording shows this reference to be to a\r\n   special piece of artillery, perhaps that of f. 302.\r\n\r\n   [1741] A string of camels contains from five to seven, or, in\r\n   poetry, even more (Vullers, ii, 728, _sermone poetico series\r\n   decem camelorum_). The item of food compared is corn only\r\n   (_būghūz_) and takes no account therefore of the elephant's\r\n   green food.\r\n\r\n   [1742] The Ency. Br. states that the horn seldom exceeds a\r\n   foot in length; there is one in the B.M. measuring 18 inches.\r\n\r\n   [1743] āb-khẉura kishtī, water-drinker's boat, in which name\r\n   kishtī may be used with reference to shape as boat is in\r\n   _sauce-boat_. Erskine notes that rhinoceros-horn is supposed\r\n   to sweat on approach of poison.\r\n\r\n   [1744] _aīlīk_, Pers. trs. _angusht_, finger, each seemingly\r\n   representing about one inch, a hand's thickness, a finger's\r\n   breadth.\r\n\r\n   [1745] lit. hand (_qūl_) and leg (_būt_).\r\n\r\n   [1746] The anatomical details by which Bābur supports this\r\n   statement are difficult to translate, but his grouping of the\r\n   two animals is in agreement with the modern classification of\r\n   them as two of the three _Ungulata vera_, the third being the\r\n   tapir (Fauna of British India:—Mammals, Blanford 467 and,\r\n   illustration, 468).\r\n\r\n   [1747] De Courteille (ii, 190) reads _kūmūk_, osseuse; Erskine\r\n   reads _gūmūk_, marrow.\r\n\r\n   [1748] Index _s.n._ rhinoceros.\r\n\r\n   [1749] _Bos bubalus._\r\n\r\n   [1750] \"so as to grow into the flesh\" (Erskine, p. 317).\r\n\r\n   [1751] _sic_ in text. It may be noted that the name _nīl-gāī_,\r\n   common in general European writings, is that of the cow;\r\n   _nīl-gāū_, that of the bull (Blanford).\r\n\r\n   [1752] _b:ḥ:rī qūṯās_; _see_ Appendix M.\r\n\r\n   [1753] The doe is brown (Blanford, p. 518). The word _būghū_\r\n   (stag) is used alone just below and seems likely to represent\r\n   the bull of the Asiatic wapiti (f. 4 n. on _būghū-marāl_.)\r\n\r\n   [1754] _Axis porcinus_ (Jerdon, _Cervus porcinus_).\r\n\r\n   [1755] _Saiga tartarica_ (Shaw). Turkī _hūna_ is used, like\r\n   English deer, for male, female, and both. Here it seems\r\n   defined by _aīrkākī_ to mean stag or buck.\r\n\r\n   [1756] _Antelope cervicapra_, black-buck, so called from the\r\n   dark hue of its back (Yule's H.J. _s.n._ Black-buck).\r\n\r\n   [1757] _tūyūq_, underlined in the Elph. MS. by _kura_,\r\n   cannon-ball; Erskine, foot-ball, de Courteille, _pierre plus\r\n   grosse que la cheville_ (_tūyāq_).\r\n\r\n   [1758] This mode of catching antelopes is described in the\r\n   _Āyīn-i-akbarī_, and is noted by Erskine as common in his day.\r\n\r\n   [1759] _H. gainā._ It is 3 feet high (Yule's H.J. _s.n._\r\n   Gynee). Cf. A. A. Blochmann, p. 149. The ram with which it is\r\n   compared may be that of _Ovis ammon_ (Vigné's _Kashmīr etc._\r\n   ii, 278).\r\n\r\n   [1760] Here the Pers. trs. adds:—They call this kind of monkey\r\n   _langūr_ (baboon, I.O. 217 f. 192).\r\n\r\n   [1761] Here the Pers. trs. adds what Erskine mistakenly\r\n   attributes to Bābur:—People bring it from several\r\n   islands.—They bring yet another kind from several islands,\r\n   yellowish-grey in colour like a _pūstīn tīn_ (leather coat of\r\n   ?; Erskine, skin of the fig, _tīn_). Its head is broader and\r\n   its body much larger than those of other monkeys. It is very\r\n   fierce and destructive. It is singular _quod penis ejus semper\r\n   sit erectus, et nunquam non ad coitum idoneus_ [Erskine].\r\n\r\n   [1762] This name is explained on the margin of the Elph. MS.\r\n   as \"_rāsū_, which is the weasel of Tartary\" (Erskine). _Rāsū_\r\n   is an Indian name for the squirrel _Sciurus indicus_. The\r\n   _kīsh_, with which Bābur's _nūl_ is compared, is explained by\r\n   de C. as _belette_, weasel, and by Steingass as a fur-bearing\r\n   animal; the fur-bearing weasel is (_Mustelidae_) _putorius\r\n   ermina_, the ermine-weasel (Blanford, p. 165), which thus\r\n   seems to be Bābur's _kīsh_. The alternative name Bābur gives\r\n   for his _nūl_, _i.e._ _mūsh-i-khūrma_, is, in India, that of\r\n   _Sciurus palmarum_, the palm-squirrel (G. of I. i, 227); this\r\n   then, it seems that Bābur's _nūl_ is. Erskine took _nūl_ here\r\n   to be the mongoose (_Herpestes mūngūs_) (p. 318); and\r\n   Blanford, perhaps partly on Erskine's warrant, gives\r\n   _mūsh-i-khūrma_ as a name of the lesser _mungūs_ of Bengal. I\r\n   gather that the name _nawal_ is not exclusively confined even\r\n   now to the (_mungūs_.)\r\n\r\n   [1763] If this be a tree-mouse and not a squirrel, it may be\r\n   _Vandeleuria oleracea_ (G. of I. i, 228).\r\n\r\n   [1764] The notes to this section are restricted to what serves\r\n   to identify the birds Bābur mentions, though temptation is\r\n   great to add something to this from the mass of interesting\r\n   circumstance scattered in the many writings of observers and\r\n   lovers of birds. I have thought it useful to indicate to what\r\n   language a bird's name belongs.\r\n\r\n   [1765] Persian, _gul_; English, eyes.\r\n\r\n   [1766] _qūlāch_ (Zenker, p. 720); Pers. trs. (217 f. 192_b_)\r\n   _yak qad-i-adm_; de Courteille, _brasse_ (fathom). These three\r\n   are expressions of the measure from finger-tip to finger-tip\r\n   of a man's extended arms, which should be his height, a fathom\r\n   (6 feet).\r\n\r\n   [1767] _qānāt_, of which here \"primaries\" appears to be the\r\n   correct rendering, since Jerdon says (ii, 506) of the bird\r\n   that its \"wings are striated black and white, primaries and\r\n   tail deep chestnut\".\r\n\r\n   [1768] The _qīrghāwal_, which is of the pheasant species, when\r\n   pursued, will take several flights immediately after each\r\n   other, though none long; peacocks, it seems, soon get tired\r\n   and take to running (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1769] Ar. _barrāq_, as on f. 278_b_ last line where the Elph.\r\n   MS. has _barrāq_, marked with the _tashdīd_.\r\n\r\n   [1770] This was, presumably, just when Bābur was writing the\r\n   passage.\r\n\r\n   [1771] This sentence is in Arabic.\r\n\r\n   [1772] A Persian note, partially expunged from the text of the\r\n   Elph. MS. is to the effect that 4 or 5 other kinds of parrot\r\n   are heard of which the revered author did not see.\r\n\r\n   [1773] Erskine suggests that this may be the _loory_\r\n   (_Loriculus vernalis_, Indian loriquet).\r\n\r\n   [1774] The birds Bābur classes under the name _shārak_ seem to\r\n   include what Oates and Blanford (whom I follow as they give\r\n   the results of earlier workers) class under _Sturnus_,\r\n   _Eulabes_ and _Calornis_, starling, grackle and mīna, and\r\n   tree-stare (_Fauna of British India_, Oates, vols. i and ii,\r\n   Blanford, vols. iii and iv).\r\n\r\n   [1775] Turkī, _qabā_; Ilminsky, p. 361, _tang_ (_tund_?).\r\n\r\n   [1776] E. D. Ross's _Polyglot List of Birds_, p. 314,\r\n   _Chighīr-chīq_, Northern swallow; Elph. MS. f. 230_b_\r\n   interlined _jil_ (Steingass lark). The description of the bird\r\n   allows it to be _Sturnus humii_, the Himālayan starling\r\n   (Oates, i, 520).\r\n\r\n   [1777] Elph. and Ḥai. MSS. (Sans. and Bengālī) _p:ndūī_; two\r\n   good MSS. of the Pers. trs. (I.O. 217 and 218) _p:ndāwalī_;\r\n   Ilminsky (p. 361) _mīnā_; Erskine (_Mems._ p. 319)\r\n   _pindāwelī_, but without his customary translation of an\r\n   Indian name. The three forms shewn above can all mean \"having\r\n   protuberance or lump\" (_pinḍā_) and refer to the bird's\r\n   wattle. But the word of the presumably well-informed scribes\r\n   of I.O. 217 and 218 can refer to the bird's sagacity in speech\r\n   and be _panḍāwalī_, possessed of wisdom. With the same\r\n   spelling, the word can translate into the epithet _religiosa_,\r\n   given to the wattled _mīnā_ by Linnæus. This epithet Mr.\r\n   Leonard Wray informs me has been explained to him as due to\r\n   the frequenting of temples by the birds; and that in Malāya\r\n   they are found living in cotes near Chinese temples.—An\r\n   alternative name (one also connecting with _religiosa_)\r\n   allowed by the form of the word is _bīnḍā-walī_. H. _bīnḍā_ is\r\n   a mark on the forehead, made as a preparative to devotion by\r\n   Hindus, or in Sans. and _Bengālī_, is the spot of paint made\r\n   on an elephant's trunk; the meaning would thus be \"having a\r\n   mark\". Cf. Jerdon and Oates _s.n._ _Eulabes religiosa_.\r\n\r\n   [1778] _Eulabes intermedia_, the Indian grackle or hill-mīna.\r\n   Here the Pers. trs. adds that people call it _mīna_.\r\n\r\n   [1779] _Calornis chalybeius_, the glossy starling or\r\n   tree-stare, which never descends to the ground.\r\n\r\n   [1780] _Sturnopastor contra_, the pied mīna.\r\n\r\n   [1781] Part of the following passage about the _lūja_ (var.\r\n   _lūkha_, _lūcha_) is _verbatim_ with part of that on f. 135;\r\n   both were written about 934-5 AH. as is shewn by Shaikh Zain\r\n   (Index _s.n._) and by inference from references in the text\r\n   (Index _s.n._ B.N. date of composition). _See_ Appendix N.\r\n\r\n   [1782] Lit. mountain-partridge. There is ground for\r\n   understanding that one of the birds known in the region as\r\n   _monals_ is meant. _See_ Appendix N.\r\n\r\n   [1783] Sans. _chakora_; Ar. _durrāj_; P. _kabg_; T. _kīklīk_.\r\n\r\n   [1784] Here, probably, southern Afghānistān.\r\n\r\n   [1785] _Caccabis chukūr_ (Scully, Shaw's Vocabulary) or _C.\r\n   pallescens_ (Hume, quoted under No. 126 E. D. Ross' _Polyglot\r\n   List_).\r\n\r\n   [1786] \"In some parts of the country (_i.e._ India before 1841\r\n   AD.), tippets used to be made of the beautiful black,\r\n   white-spotted feathers of the lower plumage (of the _durrāj_),\r\n   and were in much request, but they are rarely procurable now\"\r\n   (_Bengal Sporting Magazine_ for 1841, quoted by Jerdon, ii,\r\n   561).\r\n\r\n   [1787] A broad collar of red passes round the whole neck\r\n   (Jerdon, ii, 558).\r\n\r\n   [1788] Ar. _durrāj_ means one who repeats what he hears, a\r\n   tell-tale.\r\n\r\n   [1789] Various translations have been made of this passage, \"I\r\n   have milk and sugar\" (Erskine), \"_J'ai du lait, un peu de\r\n   sucre_\" (de Courteille), but with short _sh:r_, it might be\r\n   read in more than one way ignoring milk and sugar. See Jerdon,\r\n   ii, 558 and Hobson Jobson _s.n._ Black-partridge.\r\n\r\n   [1790] Flower-faced, _Trapogon melanocephala_, the horned\r\n   (_sing_)-monal. It is described by Jahāngīr (_Memoirs_, R. and\r\n   B., ii, 220) under the names [H. and P.] _phūl-paikār_ and\r\n   Kashmīrī, _sonlū_.\r\n\r\n   [1791] _Gallus sonneratii_, the grey jungle-fowl.\r\n\r\n   [1792] Perhaps _Bambusicola fytchii_, the western\r\n   bambu-partridge. For _chīl_ see E. D. Ross, _l.c._ No. 127.\r\n\r\n   [1793] Jahāngīr (_l.c._) describes, under the Kashmīrī name\r\n   _pūṯ_, what may be this bird. It seems to be _Gallus\r\n   ferrugineus_, the red jungle-fowl (Blanford, iv, 75).\r\n\r\n   [1794] Jahāngīr helps to identify the bird by mentioning its\r\n   elongated tail-feathers,—seasonal only.\r\n\r\n   [1795] The migrant quail will be _Coturnix communis_, the grey\r\n   quail, 8 inches long; what it is compared with seems likely to\r\n   be the bush-quail, which is non-migrant and shorter.\r\n\r\n   [1796] Perhaps _Perdicula argunda_, the rock bush-quail, which\r\n   flies in small coveys.\r\n\r\n   [1797] Perhaps _Coturnix coromandelica_, the black-breasted or\r\n   rain quail, 7 inches long.\r\n\r\n   [1798] Perhaps _Motacilla citreola_, a yellow wag-tail which\r\n   summers in Central Asia (Oates, ii, 298). If so, its Kābul\r\n   name may refer to its flashing colour. Cf. E. D. Ross, _l.c._\r\n   No. 301; de Courteille's _Dictionary_ which gives _qārcha_,\r\n   wag-tail, and Zenker's which fixes the colour.\r\n\r\n   [1799] _Eupodotis edwardsii_; Turkī, _tūghdār_ or _tūghdīrī_.\r\n\r\n   [1800] Erskine noting (Mems. p. 321), that the bustard is\r\n   common in the Dakkan where it is bigger than a turkey, says it\r\n   is called _tūghdār_ and suggests that this is a corruption of\r\n   _tūghdāq_. The uses of both words are shewn by Bābur, here,\r\n   and in the next following, account of the _charz_. Cf. G. of\r\n   I. i, 260 and E. D. Ross _l.c._ Nos. 36, 40.\r\n\r\n   [1801] _Sypheotis bengalensis_ and _S. aurita_, which are both\r\n   smaller than _Otis houbara_ (_tūghdīrī_). In Hindustan _S.\r\n   aurita_ is known as _līkh_ which name is the nearest approach\r\n   I have found to Bābur's [_lūja_] _lūkha_.\r\n\r\n   [1802] Jerdon mentions (ii, 615) that this bird is common in\r\n   Afghānistān and there called _dugdaor_ (_tūghdār_,\r\n   _tūghdīrī_).\r\n\r\n   [1803] _Cf._ Appendix B, since I wrote which, further\r\n   information has made it fairly safe to say that the Hindūstān\r\n   _bāghrī-qarā_ is _Pterocles exustus_, the common sand-grouse\r\n   and that the one of f. 49b is _Pterocles arenarius_, the\r\n   larger or black-bellied sand-grouse. _P. exustus_ is said by\r\n   Yule (H. J. _s.n._ Rock-pigeon) to have been miscalled\r\n   rock-pigeon by Anglo-Indians, perhaps because its flight\r\n   resembles the pigeon's. This accounts for Erskine's rendering\r\n   (p. 321) _bāghrī-qarā_ here by rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n   [1804] _Leptoptilus dubius_, Hind. _hargīlā_. Hindūstānīs call\r\n   it _pīr-i-dīng_ (Erskine) and _peda dhauk_ (Blanford), both\r\n   names referring, perhaps, to its pouch. It is the adjutant of\r\n   Anglo-India. Cf. f. 235.\r\n\r\n   [1805] only when young (Blanford, ii, 188).\r\n\r\n   [1806] Elph. MS. _mank:sā_ or _mankīā_; Ḥai. MS. _m:nk_.\r\n   Haughton's _Bengali Dictionary_ gives two forms of the name\r\n   _mānek-jur_ and _mānak-yoī_. It is _Dissura episcopus_, the\r\n   white-necked stork (Blanford iv, 370, who gives _manik-jor_\r\n   amongst its Indian names). Jerdon classes it (ii, 737) as\r\n   _Ciconia leucocephala_. It is the beefsteak bird of\r\n   Anglo-India.\r\n\r\n   [1807] _Ciconia nigra_ (Blanford, iv, 369).\r\n\r\n   [1808] Under the Hindūstānī form, _būza_, of Persian _buzak_\r\n   the birds Bābur mentions as _buzak_ can be identified. The\r\n   large one is _Inocotis papillosus_, _būza_, _kāla būza_, black\r\n   curlew, king-curlew. The bird it equals in size is a buzzard,\r\n   Turkī _sār_ (not Persian _sār_, starling). The king-curlew has\r\n   a large white patch on the inner lesser and marginal coverts\r\n   of its wings (Blanford, iv, 303). This agrees with Bābur's\r\n   statement about the wings of the large _buzak_. Its length is\r\n   27 inches, while the starling's is 9-1/2 inches.\r\n\r\n   [1809] _Ibis melanocephala_, the white ibis, Pers. _safed\r\n   buzak_, Bengali _sabut būza_. It is 30 inches long.\r\n\r\n   [1810] Perhaps, _Plegadis falcinellus_, the glossy ibis, which\r\n   in most parts of India is a winter visitor. Its length is 25\r\n   inches.\r\n\r\n   [1811] Erskine suggests that this is _Platalea leucorodia_,\r\n   the _chamach-būza_, spoon-bill. It is 33 inches long.\r\n\r\n   [1812] _Anas poecilorhyncha._ The Ḥai. MS. writes _gharm-pāī_,\r\n   and this is the Indian name given by Blanford (iv, 437).\r\n\r\n   [1813] _Anas boschas._ Dr. Ross notes (No. 147), from the\r\n   _Sanglākh_, that _sūna_ is the drake, _būrchīn_, the duck and\r\n   that it is common in China to call a certain variety of bird\r\n   by the combined sex-names. Something like this is shewn by the\r\n   uses of _būghā_ and _marāl_ _q.v._ Index.\r\n\r\n   [1814] _Centropus rufipennis_, the common coucal (Yule's H.J.\r\n   _s.n._ Crow-pheasant); H. _makokhā_, _Cuculus castaneus_\r\n   (Buchanan, quoted by Forbes).\r\n\r\n   [1815] _Pteropus edwardsii_, the flying-fox. The inclusion of\r\n   the bat here amongst birds, may be a clerical accident, since\r\n   on f. 136 a flying-fox is not written of as a bird.\r\n\r\n   [1816] Bābur here uses what is both the Kābul and Andijān name\r\n   for the magpie, Ar. _`aqqa_ (Oates, i, 31 and Scully's Voc),\r\n   instead of T. _sāghizghān_ or P. _dam-sīcha_ (tail-wagger).\r\n\r\n   [1817] The Pers. trs. writes _sāndūlāch mamūlā_, _mamūlā_\r\n   being Arabic for wag-tail. De Courteille's Dictionary\r\n   describes the _sāndūlāch_ as small and having a long tail, the\r\n   cock-bird green, the hen, yellow. The wag-tail suiting this in\r\n   colouring is _Motacilla borealis_ (Oates, ii, 294; syn.\r\n   _Budytes viridis_, the green wag-tail); this, as a migrant,\r\n   serves to compare with the Indian \"little bird\", which seems\r\n   likely to be a red-start.\r\n\r\n   [1818] This word may represent Scully's _kirich_ and be the\r\n   Turkī name for a swift, perhaps _Cypselus affinis_.\r\n\r\n   [1819] This name is taken from its cry during the breeding\r\n   season (Yule's H.J. _s.n._ Koel).\r\n\r\n   [1820] Bābur's distinction between the three crocodiles he\r\n   mentions seems to be that of names he heard, _shīr-ābī_,\r\n   _siyāh-sār_, and _ghaṛīāl_.\r\n\r\n   [1821] In this passage my husband finds the explanation of two\r\n   somewhat vague statements of later date, one made by\r\n   Abū'l-faẓl (A. A. Blochmann, p. 65) that Akbar called the\r\n   _kīlās_ (cherry) the _shāh-ālū_ (king-plum), the other by\r\n   Jahāngīr that this change was made because _kīlās_ means\r\n   lizard (_Jahāngīr's Memoirs_, R. & B. i, 116). What Akbar did\r\n   is shewn by Bābur; it was to reject the _Persian_ name\r\n   _kīlās_, cherry, because it closely resembled _Turkī gīlās_,\r\n   lizard. There is a lizard _Stellio Lehmanni_ of Transoxiana\r\n   with which Bābur may well have compared the crocodile's\r\n   appearance (Schuyler's _Turkistān_, i, 383). Akbar in\r\n   Hindūstān may have had _Varanus salvator_ (6 ft. long) in\r\n   mind, if indeed he had not the great lizard, _al lagarto_, the\r\n   alligator itself in his thought. The name _kīlās_ evidently\r\n   was banished only from the Court circle, since it is still\r\n   current in Kashmīr (Blochmann _l.c._ p. 616); and Speede (p.\r\n   201) gives _keeras_, cherry, as used in India.\r\n\r\n   [1822] This name as now used, is that of the purely\r\n   fish-eating crocodile. [In the Turkī text Bābur's account of\r\n   the _ghaṛīāl_ follows that of the porpoise; but it is grouped\r\n   here with those of the two other crocodiles.]\r\n\r\n   [1823] As the Ḥai. MS. and also I.O. 216 f. 137 (Pers. trs.)\r\n   write _kalah_ (_galah_)-fish, this may be a large cray-fish.\r\n   One called by a name approximating to _galah_-fish is found in\r\n   Malāyan waters, _viz._ the _galah_-prawn (_hūdang_) (cf.\r\n   Bengālī _gūla-chingrī_, _gūla_-prawn, Haughton). _Galah_ and\r\n   _gūla_ may express lament made when the fish is caught\r\n   (Haughton pp. 931, 933, 952); or if _kalah_ be read, this may\r\n   express scolding. Two good MSS. of the _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_\r\n   (Pers. trs.) write _kaka_; and their word cannot but have\r\n   weight. Erskine reproduces _kaka_ but offers no explanation of\r\n   it, a failure betokening difficulty in his obtaining one. My\r\n   husband suggests that _kaka_ may represent a stuttering sound,\r\n   doing so on the analogy of Vullers' explanation of the\r\n   word,—_Vir ridiculus et facetus qui simul balbutiat_; and also\r\n   he inclines to take the fish to be a crab (_kakra_). Possibly\r\n   _kaka_ is a popular or vulgar name for a cray-fish or a crab.\r\n   Whether the sound is lament, scolding, or stuttering the\r\n   fisherman knows! Shaikh Zain enlarges Bābur's notice of this\r\n   fish; he says the bones are prolonged (_bar āwarda_) from the\r\n   ears, that these it agitates at time of capture, making a\r\n   noise like the word _kaka_ by which it is known, that it is\r\n   two _wajab_ (18 in.) long, its flesh surprisingly tasty, and\r\n   that it is very active, leaping a _gaz_ (_cir._ a yard) out of\r\n   the water when the fisherman's net is set to take it. For\r\n   information about the Malāyan fish, I am indebted to Mr. Cecil\r\n   Wray.\r\n\r\n   [1824] T. _qiyünlīghī_, presumably referring to spines or\r\n   difficult bones; T. _qīn_, however, means a scabbard [Shaw].\r\n\r\n   [1825] One of the common frogs is a small one which, when\r\n   alarmed, jumps along the surface of the water (G. of I. i,\r\n   273).\r\n\r\n   [1826] _Anb_ and _anbah_ (pronounced _aṃb_ and _aṃbah_) are\r\n   now less commonly used names than _ām_. It is an interesting\r\n   comment on Bābur's words that Abū'l-faẓl spells _anb_, letter\r\n   by letter, and says that the _b_ is quiescent (_Āyīn_ 28; for\r\n   the origin of the word mango, _vide_ Yule's H.J. _s.n._).\r\n\r\n   [1827] A corresponding diminutive would be fairling.\r\n\r\n   [1828] The variants, entered in parenthesis, are found in the\r\n   Bib. Ind. ed. of the _Āyīn-i-akbarī_ p. 75 and in a (bazar)\r\n   copy of the _Qurānu's-sā`dain_ in my husband's possession. As\r\n   Amīr Khusrau was a poet of Hindūstān, either _khẉash_\r\n   (_khẉesh_) [our own] or _mā_ [our] would suit his meaning. The\r\n   couplet is, literally:—\r\n\r\n     Our fairling, [_i.e._ mango] beauty-maker of the garden,\r\n     Fairest fruit of Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n   [1829] Daulat Khān _Yūsuf-khail Lūdī_ in 929 AH. sent Bābur a\r\n   gift of mangoes preserved in honey (_in loco_ p. 440).\r\n\r\n   [1830] I have learned nothing more definite about the word\r\n   _kārdī_ than that it is the name of a superior kind of peach\r\n   (_Ghiyās̤u'l-lughat_).\r\n\r\n   [1831] The preceding sentence is out of place in the Turkī\r\n   text; it may therefore be a marginal note, perhaps not made by\r\n   Bābur.\r\n\r\n   [1832] This sentence suggests that Bābur, writing in Āgra or\r\n   Fatḥpūr did not there see fine mango-trees.\r\n\r\n   [1833] See Yule's H.J. on the plantain, the banana of the\r\n   West.\r\n\r\n   [1834] This word is a descendant of Sanscrit _mocha_, and\r\n   parent of _musa_ the botanical name of the fruit (Yule).\r\n\r\n   [1835] Shaikh Effendī (Kunos), Zenker and de Courteille say of\r\n   this only that it is the name of a tree. Shaw gives a name\r\n   that approaches it, _ārman_, a grass, a weed; Scully explains\r\n   this as _Artemisia vulgaris_, wormwood, but Roxburgh gives no\r\n   _Artemisia_ having a leaf resembling the plantain's. Scully\r\n   has _arāmadān_, unexplained, which, like _amān-qarā_, may\r\n   refer to comfort in shade. Bābur's comparison will be with\r\n   something known in Transoxiana. Maize has general resemblance\r\n   with the plantain. So too have the names of the plants, since\r\n   _mocha_ and _mauz_ stand for the plantain and (Hindī) _mukā'ī_\r\n   for maize. These incidental resemblances bear, however\r\n   lightly, on the question considered in the Ency. Br. (art.\r\n   maize) whether maize was early in Asia or not; some writers\r\n   hold that it was; if Bābur's _amān-qarā_ were maize, maize\r\n   will have been familiar in Transoxiana in his day.\r\n\r\n   [1836] Abū'l-faẓl mentions that the plantain-tree bears no\r\n   second crop unless cut down to the stump.\r\n\r\n   [1837] Bābur was fortunate not to have met with a seed-bearing\r\n   plantain.\r\n\r\n   [1838] The ripe \"dates\" are called P. _tamar-i Hind_, whence\r\n   our tamarind, and _Tamarindus Indica_.\r\n\r\n   [1839] _Sophora alopecuroides_, a leguminous plant (Scully).\r\n\r\n   [1840] Abū'l-faẓl gives _galaundā_ as the name of the \"fruit\"\r\n   [_mewa_],—Forbes, as that of the fallen flower. Cf. Brandis p.\r\n   426 and Yule's H.J. _s.n._ Mohwa.\r\n\r\n   [1841] Bābur seems to say that spirit is extracted from both\r\n   the fresh and the dried flowers. The fresh ones are favourite\r\n   food with deer and jackals; they have a sweet spirituous\r\n   taste. Erskine notes that the spirit made from them was\r\n   well-known in Bombay by the name of Moura, or of Parsi-brandy,\r\n   and that the farm of it was a considerable article of revenue\r\n   (p. 325 n.). Roxburgh describes it as strong and intoxicating\r\n   (p. 411).\r\n\r\n   [1842] This is the name of a green, stoneless grape which when\r\n   dried, results in a raisin resembling the sultanas of Europe\r\n   (_Jahāngīr's Memoirs_ and Yule's H.J. _s.n._; Griffiths'\r\n   _Journal of Travel_ pp. 359, 388).\r\n\r\n   [1843] _Aūl_, lit. the _aūl_ of the flower. The Persian\r\n   translation renders _aūl_ by _bū_ which may allow both words\r\n   to be understood in their (root) sense of _being_, _i.e._\r\n   natural state. De Courteille translates by _quand la fleur est\r\n   fraîche_ (ii, 210); Erskine took _bū_ to mean smell (_Memoirs_\r\n   p. 325), but the _aūl_ it translates, does not seem to have\r\n   this meaning. For reading _aūl_ as \"the natural state\", there\r\n   is circumstantial support in the flower's being eaten raw\r\n   (Roxburgh). The annotator of the Elphinstone MS. [whose\r\n   defacement of that Codex has been often mentioned], has added\r\n   points and _tashdīd_ to the _aūl-ī_ (_i.e._ its _aūl_), so as\r\n   to produce _awwalī_ (first, f. 235). Against this there are\r\n   the obvious objections that the Persian translation does not\r\n   reproduce, and that its _bū_ does not render _awwalī_; also\r\n   that _aūl-ī_ is a noun with its enclitic genitive _yā_ (_i_).\r\n\r\n   [1844] This word seems to be meant to draw attention to the\r\n   various merits of the _mahuwā_ tree.\r\n\r\n   [1845] Erskine notes that this is not to be confounded with E.\r\n   _jāmbū_, the rose-apple (_Memoirs_ p. 325 n.). Cf. Yule's H.J.\r\n   _s.n. Jambu_.\r\n\r\n   [1846] var. _ghat-ālū_, _ghab-ālū_, _ghain-ālū_, _shafl-ālū_.\r\n   Scully enters _`ain-ālū_ (true-plum?) unexplained. The\r\n   _kamrak_ fruit is 3 in. long (Brandis) and of the size of a\r\n   lemon (Firminger); dimensions which make Bābur's 4 _aīlīk_\r\n   (hand's-thickness) a slight excess only, and which thus allow\r\n   _aīlīk_, with its Persion translation, _angusht_, to be\r\n   approximately an inch.\r\n\r\n   [1847] Speede, giving the fruit its Sanscrit name _kamarunga_,\r\n   says it is acid, rather pleasant, something like an insipid\r\n   apple; also that its pretty pink blossoms grow on the trunk\r\n   and main branches (i, 211).\r\n\r\n   [1848] Cf. Yule's H.J. _s.n._ jack-fruit. In a Calcutta\r\n   nurseryman's catalogue of 1914 AD. three kinds of jack-tree\r\n   are offered for sale, viz. \"Crispy or Khaja, Soft or Neo,\r\n   Rose-scented\" (Seth, Feronia Nursery).\r\n\r\n   [1849] The _gīpa_ is a sheep's stomach stuffed with rice,\r\n   minced meat, and spices, and boiled as a pudding. The\r\n   resemblance of the jack, as it hangs on the tree, to the\r\n   haggis, is wonderfully complete (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1850] These when roasted have the taste of chestnuts.\r\n\r\n   [1851] Firminger (p. 186) describes an ingenious method of\r\n   training.\r\n\r\n   [1852] For a note of Humāyūn's on the jack-fruit _see_\r\n   Appendix O.\r\n\r\n   [1853] _aīd-ī-yamān aīmās._ It is somewhat curious that Bābur\r\n   makes no comment on the odour of the jack itself.\r\n\r\n   [1854] _būsh_, English bosh (Shaw). The Persian translation\r\n   inserts no more about this fruit.\r\n\r\n   [1855] Steingass applies this name to the plantain.\r\n\r\n   [1856] Erskine notes that \"this is the bullace-plum, small,\r\n   not more than twice as large as the sloe and not so\r\n   high-flavoured; it is generally yellow, sometimes red.\" Like\r\n   Bābur, Brandis enumerates several varieties and mentions the\r\n   seasonal changes of the tree (p. 170).\r\n\r\n   [1857] This will be Kābul, probably, because Transoxiana is\r\n   written of by Bābur usually, if not invariably, as \"that\r\n   country\", and because he mentions the _chīkda_ (_i.e.\r\n   chīka?_), under its Persian name _sinjid_, in his _Description\r\n   of Kābul_ (f. 129_b_).\r\n\r\n   [1858] P. _mar manjān_, which I take to refer to the\r\n   _rīwājlār_ of Kābul. (Cf. f. 129_b_, where, however, (note 5)\r\n   are _corrigenda_ of Masson's _rawash_ for _rīwāj_, and his\r\n   third to second volume.) Kehr's Codex contains an extra\r\n   passage about the _karaūn dā_, _viz._ that from it is made a\r\n   tasty fritter-like dish, resembling a rhubarb-fritter\r\n   (Ilminsky, p. 369).\r\n\r\n   [1859] People call it (P.) _pālasa_ also (Elph. MS. f. 236,\r\n   marginal note).\r\n\r\n   [1860] Perhaps the red-apple of Kābul, where two sorts are\r\n   common, both rosy, one very much so, but much inferior to the\r\n   other (Griffith's _Journal of Travel_ p. 388).\r\n\r\n   [1861] Its downy fruit grows in bundles from the trunk and\r\n   large branches (Roxburgh).\r\n\r\n   [1862] The reference by \"also\" (_ham_) will be to the _kamrak_\r\n   (f. 283_b_), but both Roxburgh and Brandis say the _amla_ is\r\n   six striated.\r\n\r\n   [1863] The Sanscrit and Bengālī name for the chirūnjī-tree is\r\n   _pīyala_ (Roxburgh p. 363).\r\n\r\n   [1864] Cf. f. 250_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1865] The leaflet is rigid enough to serve as a runlet, but\r\n   soon wears out; for this reason, the usual practice is to use\r\n   one of split bamboo.\r\n\r\n   [1866] This is a famous hunting-ground between Bīāna and\r\n   Dhūlpūr, Rājpūtāna, visited in 933 AH. (f. 33O_b_). Bābur's\r\n   great-great-grandson Shāh-jahān built a hunting-lodge there\r\n   (G. of I.).\r\n\r\n   [1867] Ḥai. MS. _mu`arrab_, but the Elph. MS. _maghrib_,\r\n   [occidentalizing]. The Ḥai. MS. when writing of the orange\r\n   (_infra_) also has _maghrib_. A distinction of locality may be\r\n   drawn by _maghrib_.\r\n\r\n   [1868] Bābur's \"Hindūstān people\" (_aīl_) are those neither\r\n   Turks nor Afghāns.\r\n\r\n   [1869] This name, with its usual form _tāḍī_ (toddy), is used\r\n   for the fermented sap of the date, coco, and _mhār_ palms also\r\n   (cf. Yule's H.J. _s.n._ toddy).\r\n\r\n   [1870] Bābur writes of the long leaf-stalk as a branch\r\n   (_shākh_); he also seems to have taken each spike of the\r\n   fan-leaf to represent a separate leaf. [For two omissions from\r\n   my trs. _see_ Appendix O.]\r\n\r\n   [1871] Most of the fruits Bābur describes as orange-like are\r\n   named in the following classified list, taken from Watts'\r\n   _Economic Products of India_:—\"+Citrus aurantium+, _narangi_,\r\n   _sangtara_, _amrit-phal_; +C. decumana+, _pumelo_, shaddock,\r\n   forbidden-fruit, _sada-phal_; +C. medica+ proper, _turunj_,\r\n   _limu_; +C. medica limonum+, _jambhira_, _karna-nebu_.\" Under\r\n   _C. aurantium_ Brandis enters both the sweet and the Seville\r\n   oranges (_nārangī_); this Bābur appears to do also.\r\n\r\n   [1872] _kīndīklīk_, explained in the Elph. Codex by _nāfwār_\r\n   (f. 238). This detail is omitted by the Persian translation.\r\n   Firminger's description (p. 221) of Aurangābād oranges\r\n   suggests that they also are navel-oranges. At the present time\r\n   one of the best oranges had in England is the navel one of\r\n   California.\r\n\r\n   [1873] Useful addition is made to earlier notes on the\r\n   variability of the _yīghāch_, a variability depending on time\r\n   taken to cover the ground, by the following passage from\r\n   Henderson and Hume's _Lahor to Yarkand_ (p. 120), which shews\r\n   that even in the last century the _farsang_ (the P. word used\r\n   in the Persian translation of the _Bābur-nāma_ for T.\r\n   _yīghāch_) was computed by time. \"All the way from Kargallik\r\n   (Qārghalīq) to Yarkand, there were tall wooden mile-posts\r\n   along the roads, at intervals of about 5 miles, or rather one\r\n   hour's journey, apart. On a board at the top of each post, or\r\n   _farsang_ as it is called, the distances were very legibly\r\n   written in Turki.\"\r\n\r\n   [1874] _ma`rib_, Elph. MS. _magharrib_; (cf. f. 285_b_ note).\r\n\r\n   [1875] _i.e. nārang_ (Sans. _nārangā_) has been changed to\r\n   _nāranj_ in the `Arab mouth. What is probably one of Humāyūn's\r\n   notes preserved by the Elph. Codex (f. 238), appears to say—it\r\n   is mutilated—that _nārang_ has been corrupted into _nāranj_.\r\n\r\n   [1876] The Elph. Codex has a note—mutilated in early\r\n   binding—which is attested by its scribe as copied from\r\n   Humāyūn's hand-writing, and is to the effect that once on his\r\n   way from the Hot-bath, he saw people who had taken poison and\r\n   restored them by giving lime-juice.\r\n\r\n   Erskine here notes that the same antidotal quality is ascribed\r\n   to the citron by Virgil:—\r\n\r\n     Media fert tristes succos. tardumque saporem\r\n     Felicis mali, quo non praesentius ullum,\r\n     Pocula si quando saevae infecere novercae,\r\n     Miscueruntque herbas et non innoxia verba,\r\n     Auxilium venit, ac membris agit atra venena.\r\n\r\n     Georgics II. v. 126.\r\n\r\n     _Vide_ Heyne's note i, 438.\r\n\r\n   [1877] P. _turunj_, wrinkled, puckered; Sans. _vījāpūra_ and\r\n   H. _bijaurā_ (_Āyīn_ 28), seed-filled.\r\n\r\n   [1878] Bābur may have confused this with H. _bijaurā_; so too\r\n   appears to have done the writer (Humāyūn?) of a [now\r\n   mutilated] note in the Elph. Codex (f. 238), which seems to\r\n   say that the fruit or its name went from Bajaur to Hindūstān.\r\n   Is the country of Bajaur so-named from its indigenous orange\r\n   (_vījāpūra_, whence _bijaurā_)? The name occurs also north of\r\n   Kangra.\r\n\r\n   [1879] Of this name variants are numerous, _santra_,\r\n   _santhara_, _samtara_, etc. Watts classes it as a _C.\r\n   aurantium_; Erskine makes it the common sweet orange;\r\n   Firminger, quoting Ross (p. 221) writes that, as grown in the\r\n   Nagpur gardens it is one of the finest Indian oranges, with\r\n   rind thin, smooth and close. The Emperor Muḥammad Shāh is said\r\n   to have altered its name to _rang-tāra_ because of its fine\r\n   colour (_rang_) (Forbes). Speede (ii, 109) gives both names.\r\n   As to the meaning and origin of the name _santara_ or\r\n   _santra_, so suggestive of Cintra, the Portuguese home of a\r\n   similar orange, it may be said that it looks like a hill-name\r\n   used in N. E. India, for there is a village in the Bhutan\r\n   Hills, (Western Duars) known from its orange groves as\r\n   Santra-bārī, Abode of the orange. To this (mentioned already\r\n   as my husband's suggestion in Mr. Crooke's ed. of Yule's H.J.)\r\n   support is given by the item \"Suntura, famous Nipal variety\",\r\n   entered in Seth's Nursery-list of 1914 (Feronia Nurseries,\r\n   Calcutta). Light on the question of origin could be thrown, no\r\n   doubt, by those acquainted with the dialects of the hill-tract\r\n   concerned.\r\n\r\n   [1880] This refers, presumably, to the absence of the beak\r\n   characteristic of all citrons.\r\n\r\n   [1881] melter, from the Sans. root _gal_, which provides the\r\n   names of several lemons by reason of their solvent quality,\r\n   specified by Bābur (_infra_) of the _amal-bīd_. Erskine notes\r\n   that in his day the _gal-gal_ was known as _kilmek_\r\n   (_galmak_?).\r\n\r\n   [1882] Sans. _jambīrā_, H. _jambīr_, classed by Abū'l-faẓl as\r\n   one of the somewhat sour fruits and by Watts as _Citrus medica\r\n   limonum_.\r\n\r\n   [1883] Watts, _C. decumana_, the shaddock or pumelo; Firminger\r\n   (p. 223) has _C. decumana pyriformis_ suiting Bābur's\r\n   \"pear-shaped\". What Bābur compared it with will be the\r\n   Transoxanian pear and quince (_P. amrūd_ and _bihī_) and not\r\n   the Indian guava and Bengal quince (_P. amrūd_ and _H. bael_).\r\n\r\n   [1884] The Turkī text writes _amrd_. Watts classes the\r\n   _amrit-phal_ as a _C. aurantium_. This supports Erskine's\r\n   suggestion that it is the mandarin-orange. Humāyūn describes\r\n   it in a note which is written pell-mell in the text of the\r\n   Elph. Codex and contains also descriptions of the _kāmila_ and\r\n   _santara_ oranges; it can be seen translated in Appendix O.\r\n\r\n   [1885] So spelled in the Turkī text and also in two good MSS.\r\n   of the Pers. trs. I.O. 217 and 218, but by Abū'l-faẓl\r\n   _amal-bīt_. Both P. _bīd_ and P. _bīt_ mean willow and cane\r\n   (ratan), so that _amal-bīd_ (_bīt_) can mean acid-willow and\r\n   acid-cane. But as Bābur is writing of a fruit like an orange,\r\n   the cane that bears an acid fruit, _Calamus rotang_, can be\r\n   left aside in favour of _Citrus medica acidissima_. Of this\r\n   fruit the solvent property Bābur mentions, as well as the\r\n   commonly-known service in cleansing metal, link it, by these\r\n   uses, with the willow and suggest a ground for understanding,\r\n   as Erskine did, that _amal-bīd_ meant acid-willow; for\r\n   willow-wood is used to rub rust off metal.\r\n\r\n   [1886] This statement shows that Bābur was writing the\r\n   _Description of Hindūstān_ in 935 AH. (1528-9 AD.), which is\r\n   the date given for it by Shaikh Zain.\r\n\r\n   [1887] This story of the needle is believed in India of all\r\n   the citron kind, which are hence called _sūī-gal_\r\n   (needle-melter) in the Dakhin (Erskine). Cf. Forbes, p. 489\r\n   _s.n. sūī-gal_.\r\n\r\n   [1888] Erskine here quotes information from Abū'l-faẓl (_Āyīn_\r\n   28) about Akbar's encouragement of the cultivation of fruits.\r\n\r\n   [1889] Hindustani (Urdu) _gaṛhal_. Many varieties of Hibiscus\r\n   (syn. Althea) grow in India; some thrive in Surrey gardens;\r\n   the _jāsūn_ by name and colour can be taken as what is known\r\n   in Malayan, Tamil, etc., as the shoe-flower, from its use in\r\n   darkening leather (Yule's H.J.).\r\n\r\n   [1890] I surmise that what I have placed between asterisks\r\n   here belongs to the next-following plant, the oleander. For\r\n   though the branches of the _jāsūn_ grow vertically, the bush\r\n   is a dense mass upon one stout trunk, or stout short stem. The\r\n   words placed in parenthesis above are not with the Ḥaidarabad\r\n   but are with the Elphinstone Codex. There would seem to have\r\n   been a scribe's skip from one \"rose\" to the other. As has been\r\n   shewn repeatedly, this part of the Bābur-nāma has been much\r\n   annotated; in the Elph. Codex, where only most of the notes\r\n   are preserved, some are entered by the scribe pell-mell into\r\n   Bābur's text. The present instance may be a case of a marginal\r\n   note, added to the text in a wrong place.\r\n\r\n   [1891] The peduncle supporting the plume of medial petals is\r\n   clearly seen only when the flower opens first. The plumed\r\n   Hibiscus is found in florists' catalogues described as\r\n   \"double\".\r\n\r\n   [1892] This Anglo-Indians call also rose-bay. A Persian name\r\n   appears to be _zahr-giyāh_, poison-grass, which makes it the\r\n   more probable that the doubtful passage in the previous\r\n   description of the _jāsūn_ belongs to the rod-like oleander,\r\n   known as the poison-grass. The oleander is common in\r\n   river-beds over much country known to Bābur, outside India.\r\n\r\n   [1893] Roxburgh gives a full and interesting account of this\r\n   tree.\r\n\r\n   [1894] Here the Elph. Codex, only, has the (seeming) note, \"An\r\n   'Arab calls it _kāẕī_\" (or _kāwī_). This fills out Steingass'\r\n   part-explanation of _kāwī_, \"the blossom of the fragrant\r\n   palm-tree, _armāṯ_\" (p. 1010), and of _armāṯ_, \"a kind of\r\n   date-tree with a fragrant blossom\" (p. 39), by making _armāṯ_\r\n   and _kāwī_ seem to be the _Pandanus_ and its flower.\r\n\r\n   [1895] _Calamus scriptorius_ (Vullers ii, 607. H. B.).\r\n   Abū'l-faẓl compares the leaves to _jawārī_, the great millet\r\n   (Forbes); Blochmann (A. A. p. 83) translates _jawārī_ by\r\n   _maize_ (_juwārā_, Forbes).\r\n\r\n   [1896] T. _aīrkāk-qūmūsh_, a name Scully enters unexplained.\r\n   Under _qūmūsh_ (reed) he enters _Arundo madagascarensis_;\r\n   Bābur's comparison will be with some Transoxanian _Arundo_ or\r\n   _Calamus_, presumably.\r\n\r\n   [1897] _Champa_ seems to have been Bābur's word (Elph. and\r\n   Ḥai. MSS.), but is the (B.) name for _Michelia champaka_; the\r\n   Pers. translation corrects it by (B.) _chambelī_, (_yāsman_,\r\n   jasmine).\r\n\r\n   [1898] Here, \"outside India\" will be meant, where Hindū rules\r\n   do not prevail.\r\n\r\n   [1899] _Hind aīlārī-nīng ibtidā-sī hilāl aīlār-nīng\r\n   istiqbāl-dīn dūr._ The use here of _istiqbāl_, welcome,\r\n   attracts attention; does it allude to the universal welcome of\r\n   lighter nights? or is it reminiscent of Muḥammadan welcome to\r\n   the Moon's crescent in Shawwāl?\r\n\r\n   [1900] For an exact statement of the intercalary months _vide_\r\n   Cunningham's _Indian Eras_, p. 91. In my next sentence\r\n   (_supra_) the parenthesis-marks indicate blanks left on the\r\n   page of the Ḥai. MS. as though waiting for information. These\r\n   and other similar blanks make for the opinion that the Ḥai.\r\n   Codex is a direct copy of Bābur's draft manuscript.\r\n\r\n   [1901] The sextuple division (_r̤itu_) of the year is referred\r\n   to on f. 284, where the Signs Crab and Lion are called the\r\n   season of the true Rains.\r\n\r\n   [1902] Bābur appears not to have entered either the Hindī or\r\n   the Persian names of the week:—the Ḥai. MS. has a blank space;\r\n   the Elph. MS. had the Persian names only, and Hindī ones have\r\n   been written in above these; Kehr has the Persian ones only;\r\n   Ilminsky has added the Hindī ones. (The spelling of the Hindī\r\n   names, in my translation, is copied from Forbes' Dictionary.)\r\n\r\n   [1903] The Ḥai. MS. writes _garī_ and _garīāl_. The word now\r\n   stands for the hour of 60 minutes.\r\n\r\n   [1904] _i.e._ gong-men. The name is applied also to an\r\n   alligator _Lacertus gangeticus_ (Forbes).\r\n\r\n   [1905] There is some confusion in the text here, the Ḥai. MS.\r\n   reading _birinj-dīn tīshī_(?) _nīma qūīūbtūrlār_—the Elph. MS.\r\n   (f. 240_b_) _biring-dīn bīr yāssī nīma qūīūbtūrlār_. The\r\n   Persian translation, being based on the text of the\r\n   Elphinstone Codex reads _az biring yak chīz pahnī rekhta and_.\r\n   The word _tīshī_ of the Ḥai. MS. may represent _tasht_ plate\r\n   or _yāssī_, broad; against the latter however there is the\r\n   sentence that follows and gives the size.\r\n\r\n   [1906] Here again the wording of the Ḥai. MS. is not clear;\r\n   the sense however is obvious. Concerning the clepsydra _vide_\r\n   A. A. Jarrett, ii, 15 and notes; Smith's _Dictionary of\r\n   Antiquities_; Yule's H.J. _s.n._ Ghurry.\r\n\r\n   [1907] The table is:—60 _bipals_ = 1 _pal_; 60 _pals_ = 1\r\n   _g'harī_ (24 m.); 60 _g'harī_ or 8 _pahr_ = one _dīn-rāt_\r\n   (nycthemeron).\r\n\r\n   [1908] Qorān, cap. CXII, which is a declaration of God's\r\n   unity.\r\n\r\n   [1909] The (S.) _ratī_ = 8 rice-grains (Eng. 8 barley-corns);\r\n   the (S.) _māsha_ is a kidney-bean; the (P.) _tānk_ is about 2\r\n   oz.; the (Ar.) _miṣqāl_ is equal to 40 _ratīs_; the (S.)\r\n   _tūla_ is about 145 oz.; the (S.) _ser_ is of various values\r\n   (Wilson's _Glossary_ and Yule's H. J.).\r\n\r\n   [1910] There being 40 Bengāl _sers_ to the _man_, Bābur's word\r\n   _mānbān_ seems to be another name for the _man_ or _maund_. I\r\n   have not found _mānbān_ or _mīnāsā_. At first sight _mānbān_\r\n   might be taken, in the Ḥai. MS. for (T.) _bātmān_, a weight of\r\n   13 or 15 lbs., but this does not suit. Cf. f. 167 note to\r\n   _bātmān_ and f. 173_b_ (where, however, in the note f. 157\r\n   requires correction to f. 167). For Bābur's table of measures\r\n   the Pers. trs. has 40 _sers_ = 1 _man_; 12 _mans_ = 1 _mānī_;\r\n   100 _mānī_ they call _mīnāsa_ (217, f. 201_b_, l. 8).\r\n\r\n   [1911] Presumably these are caste-names.\r\n\r\n   [1912] The words in parenthesis appear to be omitted from the\r\n   text; to add them brings Bābur's remark into agreement with\r\n   others on what he several times makes note of, _viz._ the\r\n   absence not only of irrigation-channels but of those which\r\n   convey \"running-waters\" to houses and gardens. Such he writes\r\n   of in Farghāna; such are a well-known charm _e.g._ in Madeira,\r\n   where the swift current of clear water flowing through the\r\n   streets, turns into private precincts by side-runlets.\r\n\r\n   [1913] The Ḥai. MS. writes _lungūtā-dīk_, like a lungūtā,\r\n   which better agrees with Bābur's usual phrasing. _Lung_ is\r\n   Persian for a cloth passed between the loins, is an equivalent\r\n   of S. _dhoti_. Bābur's use of it (_infra_) for the woman's\r\n   (P.) _chaddar_ or (S.) _sārī_ does not suit the Dictionary\r\n   definition of its meaning.\r\n\r\n   [1914] When Erskine published the Memoirs in 1826 AD. he\r\n   estimated this sum at 1-1/2 millions Sterling, but when he\r\n   published his _History of India_ in 1854, he had made further\r\n   research into the problem of Indian money values, and judged\r\n   then that Bābur's revenue was £4,212,000.\r\n\r\n   [1915] Erskine here notes that the promised details had not\r\n   been preserved, but in 1854 AD. he had found them in a\r\n   \"paraphrase of part of Bābur\", manifestly in Shaikh Zain's\r\n   work. He entered and discussed them and some matters of\r\n   money-values in Appendices D. and E. of his _History of\r\n   India_, vol. I. Ilminsky found them in Kehr's Codex (C. ii,\r\n   230). The scribe of the Elph. MS. has entered the revenues of\r\n   three _sarkārs_ only, with his usual quotation marks\r\n   indicating something extraneous or doubtful. The Ḥai. MS. has\r\n   them in contents precisely as I have entered them above, but\r\n   with a scattered mode of setting down. They are in Persian,\r\n   presumably as they were rendered to Bābur by some Indian\r\n   official. This official statement will have been with Bābur's\r\n   own papers; it will have been copied by Shaikh Zain into his\r\n   own paraphrase. It differs slightly in Erskine's and again, in\r\n   de Courteille's versions. I regret that I am incompetent to\r\n   throw any light upon the question of its values and that I\r\n   must leave some uncertain names to those more expert than\r\n   myself. Cf. Erskine's Appendices _l.c._ and Thomas' _Revenue\r\n   resources of the Mughal Empire_. For a few comments _see_ App.\r\n   P.\r\n\r\n   [1916] Here the Turkī text resumes in the Ḥai. MS.\r\n\r\n   [1917] Elph. MS. f. 243_b_; W. i. B. I.O. 215 has not the\r\n   events of this year (as to which omission _vide_ note at the\r\n   beginning of 932 AH. f. 251_b_) and 217 f. 203; Mems. p. 334;\r\n   Ilminsky's imprint p. 380; _Méms._ ii, 232.\r\n\r\n   [1918] This should be 30th if Saturday was the day of the week\r\n   (Gladwin, Cunningham and Bābur's narrative of f. 269).\r\n   Saturday appears likely to be right; Bābur entered Āgra on\r\n   Thursday 28th; Friday would be used for the Congregational\r\n   Prayer and preliminaries inevitable before the distribution of\r\n   the treasure. The last day of Bābur's narrative 932 AH. is\r\n   Thursday Rajab 28th; he would not be likely to mistake between\r\n   Friday, the day of his first Congregational prayer in Āgra,\r\n   and Saturday. It must be kept in mind that the _Description of\r\n   Hindūstān_ is an interpolation here, and that it was written\r\n   in 935 AH., three years later than the incidents here\r\n   recorded. The date Rajab 29th may not be Bābur's own entry; or\r\n   if it be, may have been made after the interpolation of the\r\n   dividing mass of the _Description_ and made wrongly.\r\n\r\n   [1919] Erskine estimated these sums as \"probably £56,700 to\r\n   Humāyūn; and the smaller ones as £8,100, £6,480, £5,670 and\r\n   £4,860 respectively; very large sums for the age\". (_History\r\n   of India_, i. 440 n. and App. E.)\r\n\r\n   [1920] These will be his daughters. Gul-badan gives precise\r\n   details of the gifts to the family circle (_Humāyūn-nāma_ f.\r\n   10).\r\n\r\n   [1921] Some of these slaves were Sl. Ibrāhīm's dancing-girls\r\n   (Gul-badan, _ib._).\r\n\r\n   [1922] Ar. _ṣada_. Perhaps it was a station of a hundred men.\r\n   Varsak is in Badakhshān, on the water flowing to T̤āliqān from\r\n   the Khwāja Muḥammad range. Erskine read (p. 335) _ṣada Varsak_\r\n   as _ṣadūr rashk_, incentive to emulation; de C. (ii, 233)\r\n   translates _ṣada_ conjecturally by _circonscription_. Shaikh\r\n   Zain has Varsak and to the recipients of the gifts adds the\r\n   \"Khwāstīs, people noted for their piety\" (A. N. trs. H. B. i,\r\n   248 n.). The gift to Varsak may well have been made in\r\n   gratitude for hospitality received by Bābur in the time of\r\n   adversity after his loss of Samarkand and before his return to\r\n   Kābul in 920 AH.\r\n\r\n   [1923] _circa_ 10d. or 11d. Bābur left himself stripped so\r\n   bare by his far-flung largess that he was nick-named Qalandar\r\n   (Firishta).\r\n\r\n   [1924] Badāyūnī says of him (Bib. Ind. ed. i, 340) that he was\r\n   _kāfir kalīma-gū_, a pagan making the Muḥammadan Confession of\r\n   Faith, and that he had heard of him, in Akbar's time from\r\n   Bairām Khān-i-khānan, as kingly in appearance and poetic in\r\n   temperament. He was killed fighting for Rānā Sangā at Kānwaha.\r\n\r\n   [1925] This is his family name.\r\n\r\n   [1926] _i.e._ not acting with Ḥasan _Mīwātī_.\r\n\r\n   [1927] Gul-badan says that the Khwāja several times asked\r\n   leave on the ground that his constitution was not fitted for\r\n   the climate of Hindūstān; that His Majesty was not at all, at\r\n   all, willing for him to go, but gave way at length to his\r\n   importunity.\r\n\r\n   [1928] in Patiāla, about 25 miles s.w. of Aṃbāla.\r\n\r\n   [1929] Shaikh Zain, Gul-badan and Erskine write Nau-kār. It\r\n   was now that Khwāja Kalān conveyed money for the repair of the\r\n   great dam at Ghaznī (f. 139).\r\n\r\n   [1930] The friends did not meet again; that their friendship\r\n   weathered this storm is shewn by Bābur's letter of f. 359. The\r\n   _Abūshqa_ says the couplet was inscribed on a marble tablet\r\n   near the _Ḥauẓ-i-khāṣ_ at the time the Khwāja was in Dihlī\r\n   after bidding Bābur farewell in Āgra.\r\n\r\n   [1931] This quatrain is in the Rāmpūr _Dīwān_ (_q.v._ index).\r\n   The _Abūshqa_ quotes the following as Khwāja Kalān's reply,\r\n   but without mentioning where the original was found. Cf. de\r\n   Courteille, Dict. _s.n._ _taskarī_. An English version is\r\n   given in my husband's article _Some verses by the Emperor\r\n   Bābur_ (A. Q. R. January, 1911).\r\n\r\n     You shew your gaiety and your wit,\r\n     In each word there lie acres of charm.\r\n     Were not all things of Hind upside-down,\r\n     How could you in the heat be so pleasant on cold?\r\n\r\n   It is an old remark of travellers that everything in India is\r\n   the opposite of what one sees elsewhere. Tīmūr is said to have\r\n   remarked it and to have told his soldiers not to be afraid of\r\n   the elephants of India, \"For,\" said he, \"their trunks are\r\n   empty sleeves, and they carry their tails in front; in\r\n   Hindustan everything is reversed\" (H. Beveridge _ibid._). Cf.\r\n   App. Q.\r\n\r\n   [1932] Badāyūnī i, 337 speaks of him as unrivalled in music.\r\n\r\n   [1933] f. 267_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1934] _aūrūq_, which here no doubt represents the women of\r\n   the family.\r\n\r\n   [1935] _`ain parganalār._\r\n\r\n   [1936] Bābur's advance, presumably.\r\n\r\n   [1937] The full amounts here given are not in all MSS., some\r\n   scribes contenting themselves with the largest item of each\r\n   gift (_Memoirs_ p. 337).\r\n\r\n   [1938] The `Id of Shawwāl, it will be remembered, is\r\n   celebrated at the conclusion of the Ramẓān fast, on seeing the\r\n   first new moon of Shawwāl. In A.H. 932 it must have fallen\r\n   about July 11th 1526 (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1939] A square shawl, or napkin, of cloth of gold, bestowed\r\n   as a mark of rank and distinction (_Memoirs_ p. 338 n.); _une\r\n   tunique enrichie de broderies_ (_Mémoires_, ii, 240 n.).\r\n\r\n   [1940] _kamar-shamshīr._ This Steingass explains as\r\n   sword-belt, Erskine by \"sword with a belt\". The summary\r\n   following shews that many weapons were given and not belts\r\n   alone. There is a good deal of variation in the MSS. The Ḥai.\r\n   MS. has not a complete list. The most all the lists show is\r\n   that gifts were many.\r\n\r\n   [1941] f. 263_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1942] over the Ganges, a little above Anūp-shahr in the\r\n   Buland-shahr district.\r\n\r\n   [1943] A seeming omission in the text is made good in my\r\n   translation by Shaikh Zain's help, who says Qāsim was sent to\r\n   Court.\r\n\r\n   [1944] This quatrain is in the Rāmpūr _Dīwān_. It appears to\r\n   pun on Bīāna and _bī(y)ān_.\r\n\r\n   [1945] Kandār is in Rājpūtāna; Abū'l-faẓl writes Kuhan-dār,\r\n   old habitation.\r\n\r\n   [1946] This is the first time Bābur's begs are called amīrs in\r\n   his book; it may be by a scribe's slip.\r\n\r\n   [1947] Chandwār is on the Jumna, between Āgra and Etāwah.\r\n\r\n   [1948] Here _āqār-sūlār_ will stand for the waters which\r\n   flow—sometimes in marble channels—to nourish plants and charm\r\n   the eye, such for example as beautify the Tāj-maḥal\r\n   pleasaunce.\r\n\r\n   [1949] Index _s.n._ The _tālār_ is raised on pillars and open\r\n   in front; it serves often for an Audience-hall (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1950] _tāsh `imārat_, which may refer to the extra-mural\r\n   location of the house, or contrast it with the inner\r\n   _khilwat-khāna_, the women's quarters, of the next sentence.\r\n   The point is noted as one concerning the use of the word\r\n   _tāsh_ (Index _s.n._). I have found no instance in which it is\r\n   certain that Bābur uses _tāsh_, a stone or rock, as an\r\n   adjective. On f. 301 he writes _tāshdīn `imārat_,\r\n   house-of-stone, which the Persian text renders by\r\n   _`imārat-i-sangīn_. Wherever _tāsh_ can be translated as\r\n   meaning outer, this accords with Bābur's usual diction.\r\n\r\n   [1951] _bāghcha_ (Index _s.n._). That Bābur was the admitted\r\n   pioneer of orderly gardens in India is shewn by the 30th\r\n   _Āyīn_, On Perfumes:—\"After the foot-prints of Firdaus-makānī\r\n   (Bābur) had added to the glory of Hindūstān, embellishment by\r\n   avenues and landscape-gardening was seen, while\r\n   heart-expanding buildings and the sound of falling-waters\r\n   widened the eyes of beholders.\"\r\n\r\n   [1952] Perhaps _gaz_, each somewhat less than 36 inches.\r\n\r\n   [1953] The more familiar Indian name is _baoli_. Such wells\r\n   attracted Peter Mundy's attention; Yule gives an account of\r\n   their names and plan (Mundy's _Travels in Asia_, Hakluyt\r\n   Society, ed. R. C. Temple, and Yule's _Hobson Jobson_ _s.n._\r\n   Bowly). Bābur's account of his great _wāīn_ is not easy to\r\n   translate; his interpreters vary from one another; probably no\r\n   one of them has felt assured of translating correctly.\r\n\r\n   [1954] _i.e._ the one across the river.\r\n\r\n   [1955] _tāsh masjid_; this, unless some adjectival affix\r\n   (_e.g._ _dīn_) has been omitted by the scribe, I incline to\r\n   read as meaning extra, supplementary, or outer, not as\r\n   \"mosque-of-stone\".\r\n\r\n   [1956] or Jājmāwa, the old name for the sub-district of\r\n   Kānhpūr (Cawnpur).\r\n\r\n   [1957] _i.e._ of the Corps of Braves.\r\n\r\n   [1958] Dilmāū is on the left bank of the Ganges, s.e. from\r\n   Bareilly (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1959] _Marv-nīng bundī-nī bāghlāb_, which Erskine renders by\r\n   \"Having settled the revenue of Merv\", and de Courteille by,\r\n   \"_Aprés avoir occupé Merv_.\" Were the year's revenues\r\n   compressed into a 40 to 50 days collection?\r\n\r\n   [1960] _i.e._ those who had part in his brother's murder. Cf.\r\n   Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad's _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_ and the\r\n   _Mīrat-i-sikandarī_ (trs. _History of Gujrat_ E. C. Bayley).\r\n\r\n   [1961] Elph. MS. f. 252; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 199b and 217 f.\r\n   208_b_; Mems. p. 343.\r\n\r\n   [1962] _sīūnchī_ (Zenker). Fārūq was Māhīm's son; he died in\r\n   934 A.H. before his father had seen him.\r\n\r\n   [1963] _ṣalaḥ._ It is clear from the \"_tāsh-awī\"_ (Pers. trs.\r\n   _khāna-i-sang_) of this mortar (_qāzān_) that stones were its\r\n   missiles. Erskine notes that from Bābur's account cannon would\r\n   seem sometimes to have been made in parts and clamped\r\n   together, and that they were frequently formed of iron bars\r\n   strongly compacted into a circular shape. The accoutrement\r\n   (_ṣalaḥ_) presumably was the addition of fittings.\r\n\r\n   [1964] About £40,000 sterling (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1965] The MSS. write Ṣafar but it seems probable that\r\n   Muḥarram should be substituted for this; one ground for not\r\n   accepting Ṣafar being that it breaks the consecutive order of\r\n   dates, another that Ṣafar allows what seems a long time for\r\n   the journey from near Dilmāū to Āgra. All MSS. I have seen\r\n   give the 8th as the day of the month but Erskine has 20th. In\r\n   this part of Bābur's writings dates are sparse; it is a\r\n   narrative and not a diary.\r\n\r\n   [1966] This phrase, foreign to Bābur's diction, smacks of a\r\n   Court-Persian milieu.\r\n\r\n   [1967] Here the Elph. MS. has Ṣafar Muḥarram (f. 253), as has\r\n   also I.O. 215 f. 200b, but it seems unsafe to take this as an\r\n   _al Ṣafarānī_ extension of Muḥarram because Muḥ.-Ṣafar 24th\r\n   was not a Wednesday. As in the passage noted just above, it\r\n   seems likely that Muḥarram is right.\r\n\r\n   [1968] Cf. f. 15_b_ note to Qaṃbar-i-`alī. The title\r\n   _Akhta-begī_ is to be found translated by \"Master of the\r\n   Horse\", but this would not suit both uses of _akhta_ in the\r\n   above sentence. Cf. Shaw's Vocabulary.\r\n\r\n   [1969] _i.e._ Tahangaṛh in Karauli, Rājpūtāna.\r\n\r\n   [1970] Perhaps _sipāhī_ represents Hindūstānī foot-soldiers.\r\n\r\n   [1971] Rafī`u-d-dīn _Ṣafawī_, a native of Īj near the Persian\r\n   Gulf, teacher of Abū'l-faẓl's father and buried near Āgra\r\n   (_Āyīn-i-akbarī_).\r\n\r\n   [1972] This phrase, again, departs from Bābur's simplicity of\r\n   statement.\r\n\r\n   [1973] About £5,000 (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1974] About £17,500 (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [1975] Ḥai. MS. and 215 f. 201b, Hastī; Elph. MS. f. 254, and\r\n   Ilminsky, p. 394, Aīmīshchī; _Memoirs_, p. 346, Imshiji, so\r\n   too _Mémoires_, ii, 257.\r\n\r\n   [1976] About £5000 (Erskine). Bīānwān lies in the _sūbah_ of\r\n   Āgra.\r\n\r\n   [1977] Cf. f. 175 for Bābur's estimate of his service.\r\n\r\n   [1978] Cf. f. 268_b_ for Bābur's clemency to him.\r\n\r\n   [1979] Firishta. (Briggs ii, 53) mentions that Asad had gone\r\n   to T̤ahmāsp from Kābul to congratulate him on his accession.\r\n   Shāh Ismā`īl had died in 930 AH. (1524 AD.); the title\r\n   Shāh-zāda is a misnomer therefore in 933 AH.—one possibly\r\n   prompted by T̤ahmāsp's youth.\r\n\r\n   [1980] The letter is likely to have been written to Māhīm and\r\n   to have been brought back to India by her in 935 AH. (f.\r\n   380_b_). Some MSS. of the Pers. trs. reproduce it in Turkī and\r\n   follow this by a Persian version; others omit the Turkī.\r\n\r\n   [1981] Turkī, _būā_. Hindī _bawā_ means sister or\r\n   paternal-aunt but this would not suit from Bābur's mouth, the\r\n   more clearly not that his epithet for the offender is\r\n   _bad-bakht_. Gul-badan (H.N. f. 19) calls her \"ill-omened\r\n   demon\".\r\n\r\n   [1982] She may have been still in the place assigned to her\r\n   near Āgra when Bābur occupied it (f. 269).\r\n\r\n   [1983] f. 290. Erskine notes that the _tūla_ is about equal in\r\n   weight to the silver _rūpī_.\r\n\r\n   [1984] It appears from the kitchen-arrangements detailed by\r\n   Abū'l-faẓl, that before food was dished up, it was tasted from\r\n   the pot by a cook and a subordinate taster, and next by the\r\n   Head-taster.\r\n\r\n   [1985] The Turkī sentences which here follow the well-known\r\n   Persian proverb, _Rasīda būd balāī walī ba khair guẕasht_, are\r\n   entered as verse in some MSS.; they may be a prose quotation.\r\n\r\n   [1986] She, after being put under contribution by two of\r\n   Bābur's officers (f. 307_b_) was started off for Kābul, but,\r\n   perhaps dreading her reception there, threw herself into the\r\n   Indus in crossing and was drowned. (Cf. A.N. trs. H. Beveridge\r\n   _Errata_ and _addenda_ p. xi for the authorities.)\r\n\r\n   [1987] _gil makhtūm_, Lemnian earth, _terra sigillata_, each\r\n   piece of which was impressed, when taken from the quarry, with\r\n   a guarantee-stamp (Cf. Ency. Br. _s.n._ Lemnos).\r\n\r\n   [1988] _tirīāq-i-fārūq_, an antidote.\r\n\r\n   [1989] Index _s.n._\r\n\r\n   [1990] Kāmrān was in Qandahār (Index _s.n._). Erskine observes\r\n   here that Bābur's omission to give the name of Ibrāhīm's son,\r\n   is noteworthy; the son may however have been a child and his\r\n   name not known to or recalled by Bābur when writing some years\r\n   later.\r\n\r\n   [1991] f. 299_b_.\r\n\r\n   [1992] The _Āyīn-i-akbarī_ locates this in the _sarkār_ of\r\n   Jūn-pūr, a location suiting the context. The second Persian\r\n   translation (`Abdu'r-raḥīm's) has here a scribe's skip from\r\n   one \"news\" to another (both asterisked in my text); hence\r\n   Erskine has an omission.\r\n\r\n   [1993] This is the Chār-bāgh of f. 300, known later as the Rām\r\n   (Arām)-bāgh (Garden-of-rest).\r\n\r\n   [1994] Presumably he was coming up from Marwār.\r\n\r\n   [1995] This name varies; the Ḥai. MS. in most cases writes\r\n   Qismatī, but on f. 267_b_, Qismatāī; the Elph. MS. on f. 220\r\n   has Q:s:mnāī; De Courteille writes Qismī.\r\n\r\n   [1996] _artkāb qīldī_, perhaps drank wine, perhaps ate\r\n   opium-confections to the use of which he became addicted later\r\n   on (Gulbadan's _Humāyūn-nāma_ f. 30_b_ and 73_b_).\r\n\r\n   [1997] _furṣatlār_, _i.e._ between the occupation of Āgra and\r\n   the campaign against Rānā Sangā.\r\n\r\n   [1998] Apparently the siege Bābur broke up in 931 AH. had been\r\n   renewed by the Aūzbegs (f. 255_b_ and Trs. Note _s.a._ 931 AH.\r\n   section _c_).\r\n\r\n   [1999] These places are on the Khulm-river between Khulm and\r\n   Kāhmard. The present tense of this and the following sentences\r\n   is Babur's.\r\n\r\n   [2000] f. 261.\r\n\r\n   [2001] Erskine here notes that if the _ser_ Bābur mentions be\r\n   one of 14 _tūlas_, the value is about £27; if of 24 _tūlas_,\r\n   about £45.\r\n\r\n   [2002] T. _chāpdūq_. Cf. the two Persian translations 215 f.\r\n   205_b_ and 217 f. 215; also Ilminsky, p. 401.\r\n\r\n   [2003] _būlghān chīrīkī._ The Rānā's forces are thus stated by\r\n   Tod (_Rājastān; Annals of Marwār_ Cap. ix):—\"Eighty thousand\r\n   horse, 7 Rajas of the highest rank, 9 Raos, and 104 chieftains\r\n   bearing the titles of Rawul and Rawut, with 500 war-elephants,\r\n   followed him into the field.\" Bābur's army, all told, was\r\n   12,000 when he crossed the Indus from Kābul; it will have had\r\n   accretions from his own officers in the Panj-āb and some also\r\n   from other quarters, and will have had losses at Pānipat; his\r\n   reliable kernel of fighting-strength cannot but have been\r\n   numerically insignificant, compared with the Rājpūt host. Tod\r\n   says that almost all the princes of Rājastān followed the Rānā\r\n   at Kanwā.\r\n\r\n   [2004] _dūrbātūr._ This is the first use of the word in the\r\n   _Bābur-nāma_; the defacer of the Elph. Codex has altered it to\r\n   _aūrātūr_.\r\n\r\n   [2005] Shaikh Zain records [Abū'l-faẓl also, perhaps quoting\r\n   from him] that Bābur, by varying diacritical points, changed\r\n   the name Sīkrī to Shukrī in sign of gratitude for his victory\r\n   over the Rānā. The place became the Fatḥpūr-sīkrī of Akbar.\r\n\r\n   [2006] Erskine locates this as 10 to 12 miles n.w. of Bīāna.\r\n\r\n   [2007] This phrase has not occurred in the B.N. before;\r\n   presumably it expresses what has not yet been expressed; this\r\n   Erskine's rendering, \"each according to the speed of his\r\n   horse,\" does also. The first Persian translation, which in\r\n   this portion is by Muḥammad-qulī _Mughūl Ḥiṣārī_, translates\r\n   by _az daṃbal yak dīgar_ (I.O. 215, f. 205_b_); the second,\r\n   `Abdu'r-rāḥīm's, merely reproduces the phrase; De Courteille\r\n   (ii, 272) appears to render it by (amirs) _que je ne nomme\r\n   pas_. If my reading of T̤āhir-tibrī's failure be correct\r\n   (_infra_), Erskine's translation suits the context.\r\n\r\n   [2008] The passage cut off by my asterisks has this outside\r\n   interest that it forms the introduction to the so-called\r\n   \"Fragments\", that is, to certain Turkī matter not included in\r\n   the standard _Bābur-nāma_, but preserved with the\r\n   Kehr—Ilminsky—de Courteille text. As is well-known in\r\n   Bāburiana, opinion has varied as to the genesis of this\r\n   matter; there is now no doubt that it is a translation into\r\n   Turkī from the (_Persian_) _Akbar-nāma_, prefaced by the\r\n   above-asterisked passage of the _Bābur-nāma_ and continuous\r\n   (with slight omissions) from Bib. Ind. ed. i, 106 to 120 (trs.\r\n   H. Beveridge i, 260 to 282). It covers the time from before\r\n   the battle of Kanwā to the end of Abū'l-faẓl's description of\r\n   Bābur's death, attainments and Court; it has been made to seem\r\n   Bābur's own, down to his death-bed, by changing the third\r\n   person of A.F.'s narrative into the autobiographical first\r\n   person. (Cf. Ilminsky, p. 403 l. 4 and p. 494; _Mémoires_ ii,\r\n   272 and 443 to 464; JRAS. 1908, p. 76.)\r\n\r\n   A minute point in the history of the B.N. manuscripts may be\r\n   placed on record here; _viz._ that the variants from the true\r\n   _Bābur-nāma_ text which occur in the Kehr-Ilminsky one, occur\r\n   also in the corrupt Turkī text of I.O. No. 214 (JRAS 1900, p.\r\n   455).\r\n\r\n   [2009] _chāpār kūmak yītmās_, perhaps implying that the speed\r\n   of his horses was not equal to that of Muḥibb-i-'alī's.\r\n   Translators vary as to the meaning of the phrase.\r\n\r\n   [2010] Erskine and de Courteille both give Musṯafa the\r\n   commendation the Turkī and Persian texts give to the carts.\r\n\r\n   [2011] According to Tod's _Rājastān_, negotiations went on\r\n   during the interval, having for their object the fixing of a\r\n   frontier between the Rānā and Bābur. They were conducted by a\r\n   \"traitor\" Ṣalaḥ'd-dīn _Tūār_ the chief of Raisin, who moreover\r\n   is said to have deserted to Bābur during the battle.\r\n\r\n   [2012] Cf. f. 89 for Bābur's disastrous obedience to\r\n   astrological warning.\r\n\r\n   [2013] For the reading of this second line, given by the good\r\n   MSS. _viz._ _Tauba ham bī maza nīst, bachash_, Ilminsky (p.\r\n   405) has _Tauba ham bī maza, mast bakhis_, which de Courteille\r\n   [II, 276] renders by, \"_O ivrogne insensé! que ne goûtes-tu\r\n   aussi à la pénitence?_\" The Persian couplet seems likely to\r\n   be a quotation and may yet be found elsewhere. It is not in\r\n   the Rāmpūr Dīwān which contains the Turkī verses following it\r\n   (E. D. Ross p. 21).\r\n\r\n   [2014] _kīchmāklīk_, to pass over (to exceed?), to ford or go\r\n   through a river, whence to transgress. The same metaphor of\r\n   crossing a stream occurs, in connection with drinking, on f.\r\n   189_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2015] This line shews that Bābur's renouncement was of wine\r\n   only; he continued to eat confections (_ma`jūn_).\r\n\r\n   [2016] Cf. f. 186_b_. Bābur would announce his renunciation in\r\n   Dīwān; there too the forbidden vessels of precious metals\r\n   would be broken. His few words leave it to his readers to\r\n   picture the memorable scene.\r\n\r\n   [2017] This night-guard (_`asas_) cannot be the one concerning\r\n   whom Gul-badan records that he was the victim of a little joke\r\n   made at his expense by Bābur (H. N. Index _s.n._). He seems\r\n   likely to be the Ḥājī Muḥ. _`asas_ whom Abū'l-faẓl mentions in\r\n   connection with Kāmrān in 953 AH. (1547 AD.). He may be the\r\n   _`asas_ who took charge of Bābur's tomb at Āgra (cf.\r\n   Gul-badan's H. N. _s.n._ Muḥ. `Alī _`asas ṯaghāī_, and\r\n   _Akbar-nāma_ trs. i, 502).\r\n\r\n   [2018] _saqālī qīrqmāqta u qūīmāqta._ Erskine here notes that\r\n   \"a vow to leave the beard untrimmed was made sometimes by\r\n   persons who set out against the infidels. They did not trim\r\n   the beard till they returned victorious. Some vows of similar\r\n   nature may be found in Scripture\", _e.g._ II Samuel, cap. 19\r\n   v. 24.\r\n\r\n   [2019] Index _s.n._ The _tamghā_ was not really abolished\r\n   until Jahāngīr's time—if then (H. Beveridge). See Thomas'\r\n   _Revenue Resources of the Mughal Empire_.\r\n\r\n   [2020] There is this to notice here:—Bābur's narrative has\r\n   made the remission of the _tamghā_ contingent on his success,\r\n   but the _farmān_ which announced that remission is dated some\r\n   three weeks before his victory over Rānā Sangā (Jumāda II,\r\n   13th-March 16th). Manifestly Bābur's remission was absolute\r\n   and made at the date given by Shaikh Zain as that of the\r\n   _farmān_. The _farmān_ seems to have been despatched as soon\r\n   as it was ready, but may have been inserted in Bābur's\r\n   narrative at a later date, together with the preceding\r\n   paragraph which I have asterisked.\r\n\r\n   [2021] \"There is a lacuna in the Turkī copy\" (_i.e._ the\r\n   Elphinstone Codex) \"from this place to the beginning of the\r\n   year 935. Till then I therefore follow only Mr. Metcalfe's and\r\n   my own Persian copies\" (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [2022] I am indebted to my husband for this revised version of\r\n   the _farmān_. He is indebted to M. de Courteille for help\r\n   generally, and specially for the references to the Qorān\r\n   (_q.v. infra_).\r\n\r\n   [2023] The passages in italics are Arabic in the original, and\r\n   where traced to the Qorān, are in Sale's words.\r\n\r\n   [2024] _Qorān, Sūrah_ XII, v. 53.\r\n\r\n   [2025] _Sūrah_ LVII, v. 21.\r\n\r\n   [2026] _Sūrah_ LVII, v. 15.\r\n\r\n   [2027] _Sūrah_ VII, v. 140.\r\n\r\n   [2028] _Sūrah_ II, v. 185.\r\n\r\n   [2029] These may be self-conquests as has been understood by\r\n   Erskine (p. 356) and de Courteille (ii. 281) but as the Divine\r\n   \"acceptance\" would seem to Bābur vouched for by his military\r\n   success, \"victories\" may stand for his success at Kanwā.\r\n\r\n   [2030] _Sūrah_ II, 177 where, in Sale's translation, the\r\n   change referred to is the special one of altering a legacy.\r\n\r\n   [2031] The words _dīgūchī_ and _yīgūchī_ are translated in the\r\n   second _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_ by _sukhan-gūī_ and\r\n   [_wīlāyat_]_-khwār_. This ignores in them the future element\r\n   supplied by their component _gū_ which would allow them to\r\n   apply to conditions dependent on Bābur's success. The Ḥai. MS.\r\n   and Ilminsky read _tīgūchī_, supporter- or helper-to-be, in\r\n   place of the _yīgūchī_, eater-to-be I have inferred from the\r\n   _khwār_ of the Pers. translation; hence de Courteille writes\r\n   \"_amīrs auxquels incombait l'obligation de raffermir le\r\n   gouvernement_\". But Erskine, using the Pers. text alone, and\r\n   thus having _khwār_ before him, translates by, \"amīrs who\r\n   enjoyed the wealth of kingdoms.\" The two Turkī words make a\r\n   depreciatory \"jingle\", but the first one, _dīgūchī_, may imply\r\n   serious reference to the duty, declared by Muḥammad to be\r\n   incumbent upon a wazīr, of reminding his sovereign \"when he\r\n   forgetteth his duty\". Both may be taken as alluding to\r\n   dignities to be attained by success in the encounter from\r\n   which wazīrs and amīrs were shrinking.\r\n\r\n   [2032] Firdausī's _Shāh-nāma_ [Erskine].\r\n\r\n   [2033] Also Chand-wāl; it is 25 m. east of Āgra and on the\r\n   Jamna [_T̤abaqāṭ-i-nāṣirī_, Raverty, p. 742 n.9]\r\n\r\n   [2034] Probably, Overthrower of the rhinoceros, but if\r\n   _Gurg-andāz_ be read, of the wolf.\r\n\r\n   [2035] According to the Persian calendar this is the day the\r\n   Sun enters Aries.\r\n\r\n   [2036] The practical purpose of this order of march is shewn\r\n   in the account of the battle of Pānīpat, and in the Letter of\r\n   Victory, f. 319.\r\n\r\n   [2037] _kurohcha_, perhaps a short _kuroh_, but I have not\r\n   found Bābur using _cha_ as a diminutive in such a case as\r\n   _kurohcha_.\r\n\r\n   [2038] or Kānūa, in the Bīānā district and three marches from\r\n   Bīāna-town. \"It had been determined on by Rānā Sangrām Sīngh\r\n   (_i.e._ Sangā) for the northern limit of his dominions, and he\r\n   had here built a small palace.\" Tod thus describes Bābur's\r\n   foe, \"Sangā Rānā was of the middle stature, and of great\r\n   muscular strength, fair in complexion, with unusually large\r\n   eyes which appear to be peculiar to his descendants. He\r\n   exhibited at his death but the fragments of a warrior: one eye\r\n   was lost in the broil with his brother, an arm in action with\r\n   the Lodī kings of Dehlī, and he was a cripple owing to a limb\r\n   being broken by a cannon-ball in another; while he counted 80\r\n   wounds from the sword or the lance on various parts of his\r\n   body\" (Tod's _Rājastān_, cap. Annals of Mewār).\r\n\r\n   [2039] Here M. de C. has the following note (ii, 273 n.); it\r\n   supplements my own of f. 264 [n. 3]. \"_Le mot arāba, que j'ai\r\n   traduit par chariot est pris par M. Leyden_\" (this should be\r\n   Erskine) \"_dans le sens de 'gun', ce que je ne crois pas\r\n   exact; tout au plus signifierait-il affût_\" (gun-carriage).\r\n   \"_Il me parait impossible d'admettre que Bāber eût à sa\r\n   disposition une artillerie attelée aussi considérable. Ces\r\n   arāba pouvaient servir en partie à transporter des pièces de\r\n   campagne, mais ils avaient aussi une autre destination, comme\r\n   on le voit par la suite du récit._\" It does not appear to me\r\n   that Erskine _translates_ the word _arāba_ by the word _gun_,\r\n   but that the _arābas_ (all of which he took to be\r\n   gun-carriages) being there, he supposed the guns. This was not\r\n   correct as the various passages about carts as defences show\r\n   (cf. Index _s.nn._ _arāba_ and carts).\r\n\r\n   [2040] It is characteristic of Bābur that he reproduces Shaikh\r\n   Zain's _Fatḥ-nāma_, not because of its eloquence but because\r\n   of its useful details. Erskine and de Courteille have the\r\n   following notes concerning Shaikh Zain's _farmān_:—\"Nothing\r\n   can form a more striking contrast to the simple, manly and\r\n   intelligent style of Baber himself, than the pompous, laboured\r\n   periods of his secretary. Yet I have never read this Firmān to\r\n   any native of India who did not bestow unlimited admiration on\r\n   the official bombast of Zeineddin, while I have met with none\r\n   but Turks who paid due praise to the calm simplicity of Baber\"\r\n   [Mems. p. 359]. \"_Comme la précédente (farmān), cette pièce\r\n   est rédigée en langue persane et offre un modèle des plus\r\n   accomplis du style en usage dans les chancelleries orientales.\r\n   La traduction d'un semblable morceau d'éloquence est de la\r\n   plus grande difficulté, si on veut être clair, tout en restant\r\n   fidèle à l'original._\"\r\n\r\n   Like the Renunciation _farmān_, the Letter-of-victory with its\r\n   preceding sentence which I have asterisked, was probably\r\n   inserted into Bābur's narrative somewhat later than the battle\r\n   of Kānwa. Hence Bābur's pluperfect-tense \"had indited\". I am\r\n   indebted to my husband for help in revising the difficult\r\n   _Fatḥ-nāma_; he has done it with consideration of the variants\r\n   between the earlier English and the French translations. No\r\n   doubt it could be dealt with more searchingly still by one\r\n   well-versed in the Qorān and the Traditions, and thus able to\r\n   explain others of its allusions. The italics denote Arabic\r\n   passages in the original; many of these are from the Qorān,\r\n   and in tracing them M. de Courteille's notes have been most\r\n   useful to us.\r\n\r\n   [2041] Qorān, cap. 80, last sentence.\r\n\r\n   [2042] Shaikh Zain, in his version of the _Bābur-nāma_, styles\r\n   Bābur Nawāb where there can be no doubt of the application of\r\n   the title, _viz._ in describing Shāh T̤ahmāsp's gifts to him\r\n   (mentioned by Bābur on f. 305). He uses the title also in the\r\n   _farmān_ of renunciation (f. 313_b_), but it does not appear\r\n   in my text, \"royal\" (fortune) standing for it (_in loco_ p.\r\n   555, l. 10).\r\n\r\n   [2043] The possessive pronoun occurs several times in the\r\n   Letter-of-victory. As there is no semblance of putting forward\r\n   that letter as being Bābur's, the pronoun seems to imply \"on\r\n   our side\".\r\n\r\n   [2044] The _Bābur-nāma_ includes no other than Shaikh Zain's\r\n   about Kanwā. Those here alluded to will be the announcements\r\n   of success at Milwat, Pānīpat, Dībālpūr and perhaps elsewhere\r\n   in Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n   [2045] In Jūn-pūr (_Āyīn-i-akbarī_); Elliot & Dowson note (iv,\r\n   283-4) that it appears to have included, near Sikandarpūr, the\r\n   country on both sides of the Gogra, and thence on that river's\r\n   left bank down to the Ganges.\r\n\r\n   [2046] That the word Nawāb here refers to Bābur and not to his\r\n   lieutenants, is shewn by his mention (f. 278) of Sangā's\r\n   messages to himself.\r\n\r\n   [2047] Qorān, cap. 2, v. 32. The passage quoted is part of a\r\n   description of Satan, hence mention of Satan in Shaikh Zain's\r\n   next sentence.\r\n\r\n   [2048] The brahminical thread.\r\n\r\n   [2049] _khār-i-miḥnat-i-irtidād dar dāman._ This Erskine\r\n   renders by \"who fixed thorns from the pangs of apostacy in the\r\n   hem of their garments\" (p. 360). Several good MSS. have\r\n   _khār_, thorn, but Ilminsky has Ar. _khimār_, cymar, instead\r\n   (p. 411). De Courteille renders the passage by \"_portent au\r\n   pan de leurs habits la marque douloureuse de l'apostasie_\"\r\n   (ii, 290). To read _khimār_, cymar (scarf), would serve, as a\r\n   scarf is part of some Hindū costumes.\r\n\r\n   [2050] Qorān, cap. 69, v. 35.\r\n\r\n   [2051] M. Defrémery, when reviewing the French translation of\r\n   the B.N. (_Journal des Savans_ 1873), points out (p. 18) that\r\n   it makes no mention of the \"blessed ten\". Erskine mentions\r\n   them but without explanation. They are the _'asharah\r\n   mubash-sharah_, the decade of followers of Muḥammad who\r\n   \"received good tidings\", and whose certain entry into Paradise\r\n   he foretold.\r\n\r\n   [2052] Qorān, cap. 3, v. 20. M. Defrémery reads Shaikh Zain to\r\n   mean that these words of the Qorān were on the infidel\r\n   standards, but it would be simpler to read Shaikh Zain as\r\n   meaning that the infidel insignia on the standards \"denounce\r\n   punishment\" on their users.\r\n\r\n   [2053] He seems to have been a Rājpūt convert to Muḥammadanism\r\n   who changed his Hindī name Silhādī for what Bābur writes. His\r\n   son married Sangā's daughter; his fiefs were Raisin and\r\n   Sārangpūr; he deserted to Bābur in the battle of Kānwa. (Cf.\r\n   Erskine's _History of India_ i, 471 note; _Mirāt-i-sikandarī_,\r\n   Bayley's trs. _s.n._; _Akbar-nāma_, H.B.'s trs. i, 261; Tod's\r\n   _Rājastān_ cap. Mewār.)\r\n\r\n   [2054] \"Dejāl or al Masih al Dajjal, the false or lying\r\n   Messiah, is the Muhammadan Anti-christ. He is to be one-eyed,\r\n   and marked on the forehead with the letters K.F.R. signifying\r\n   Kafer, or Infidel. He is to appear in the latter days riding\r\n   on an ass, and will be followed by 70,000 Jews of Ispahān, and\r\n   will continue on the Earth 40 days, of which one will be equal\r\n   to a year, another to a month, another to a week, and the rest\r\n   will be common days. He is to lay waste all places, but will\r\n   not enter Mekka or Medina, which are to be guarded by angels.\r\n   He is finally to be slain at the gate of Lud by Jesus, for\r\n   whom the Musalmans profess great veneration, calling him the\r\n   breath or spirit of God.—See Sale's _Introductory Discourse to\r\n   the Koran_\" [Erskine].\r\n\r\n   [2055] Qorān, cap. 29, v. 5.\r\n\r\n   [2056] \"This alludes to the defeat of [an Abyssinian\r\n   Christian] Abraha the prince of Yemen who [in the year of\r\n   Muḥammad's birth] marched his army and some elephants to\r\n   destroy the _ka`ba_ of Makka. 'The Meccans,' says Sale, 'at\r\n   the appearance of so considerable a host, retired to the\r\n   neighbouring mountains, being unable to defend their city or\r\n   temple. But God himself undertook the defence of both. For\r\n   when Abraha drew near to Mecca, and would have entered it, the\r\n   elephant on which he rode, which was a very large one and\r\n   named Maḥmūd, refused to advance any nigher to the town, but\r\n   knelt down whenever they endeavoured to force him that way,\r\n   though he would rise and march briskly enough if they turned\r\n   him towards any other quarter; and while matters were in this\r\n   posture, on a sudden a large flock of birds, like swallows,\r\n   came flying from the sea-coast, every-one of which carried\r\n   three stones, one in each foot and one in its bill; and these\r\n   stones they threw down upon the heads of Abraha's men,\r\n   certainly killing every one they struck.' The rest were swept\r\n   away by a flood or perished by a plague, Abraha alone reaching\r\n   Senaa, where he also died\" [Erskine]. The above is taken from\r\n   Sale's note to the 105 chapter of the Qorān, entitled \"the\r\n   Elephant\".\r\n\r\n   [2057] Presumably black by reason of their dark large mass.\r\n\r\n   [2058] Presumably, devouring as fire.\r\n\r\n   [2059] This is 50 m. long and blocked the narrow pass of the\r\n   Caspian Iron-gates.

He was 13 years old\r\n   and, through Shāh Begīm, hereditary shāh of Badakhshān.\r\n\r\n   [2067] The Shaikh was able, it would appear, to see himself as\r\n   others saw him, since the above description of him is his own.\r\n   It is confirmed by Abū'l-faẓl and Badāyūnī's accounts of his\r\n   attainments.\r\n\r\n   [2068] The honourable post given to this amīr of Hind is\r\n   likely to be due to his loyalty to Bābur.\r\n\r\n   [2069] Aḥmad may be a nephew of Yūsuf of the same agnomen\r\n   (Index _s.nn._).\r\n\r\n   [2070] I have not discovered the name of this old servant or\r\n   the meaning of his seeming-sobriquet, Hindū. As a _qūchīn_ he\r\n   will have been a Mughūl or Turk. The circumstance of his\r\n   service with a son of Maḥmūd _Mīrān-shāhī_ (down to 905 AH.)\r\n   makes it possible that he drew his name in his youth from the\r\n   tract s.e. of Maḥmūd's Ḥiṣār territory which has been known as\r\n   Little Hind (Index _s.n._ Hind). This is however conjecture\r\n   merely. Another suggestion is that as _hindū_ can mean\r\n   _black_, it may stand for the common _qarā_ of the Turks,\r\n   _e.g._ Qarā Barlās, Black Barlās.\r\n\r\n   [2071] I am uncertain whether Qarā-qūzī is the name of a\r\n   place, or the jesting sobriquet of more than one meaning it\r\n   can be.\r\n\r\n   [2072] Soul-full, animated; var. Ḥai. MS. _khān-dār_. No\r\n   agnomen is used for Asad by Bābur. The _Akbar-nāma_ varies to\r\n   _jāmadār_, wardrobe-keeper, cup-holder (_Bib. Ind._ ed. i,\r\n   107), and Firishta to _sar-jāmadar_, head wardrobe-keeper\r\n   (lith. ed. p. 209 top). It would be surprising to find such an\r\n   official sent as envoy to `Irāq, as Asad was both before and\r\n   after he fought at Kānwa.\r\n\r\n   [2073] son of Daulat Khān _Yūsuf-khail Lūdī_.\r\n\r\n   [2074] These are the titles of the 20th and 36th chapters of\r\n   the Qorān; Sale offers conjectural explanations of them. The\r\n   \"family\" is Muḥammad's.\r\n\r\n   [2075] a Bāī-qarā Tīmūrid of Bābur's generation, their last\r\n   common ancestor being Tīmūr himself.\r\n\r\n   [2076] an Aūzbeg who married a daughter of Sl. Ḥusain M.\r\n   _Bāī-qarā_.\r\n\r\n   [2077] It has been pointed out to me that there is a Chinese\r\n   title of nobility _Yūn-wāng_, and that it may be behind the\r\n   words _jang-jang_. Though the suggestion appears to me\r\n   improbable, looking to the record of Bābur's officer, to the\r\n   prevalence of sobriquets amongst his people, and to what would\r\n   be the sporadic appearance of a Chinese title or even\r\n   class-name borne by a single man amongst them. I add this\r\n   suggestion to those of my note on the meaning of the words\r\n   (Index _s.n._ Muḥ. `Alī). The title _Jūn-wāng_ occurs in Dr.\r\n   Denison Ross' _Three MSS. from Kāshghar_, p. 5, v. 5 and\r\n   translator's preface, p. 14.\r\n\r\n   [2078] Cf. f. 266 and f. 299. _Yārāgī_ may be the name of his\r\n   office, (from _yārāq_) and mean provisioner of arms or food or\r\n   other military requirements.\r\n\r\n   [2079] or, Tardī _yakka_, the champion, Gr. _monomachus_ (A.\r\n   N. trs. i, 107 n.).\r\n\r\n   [2080] var. 1 watch and 2 _g'harīs_; the time will have been\r\n   between 9 and 10 a.m.\r\n\r\n   [2081] _jūldū ba nām al `azīz-i-barādar shud_, a phrase not\r\n   easy to translate.\r\n\r\n   [2082] _viz._ those chained together as a defence and probably\r\n   also those conveying the culverins.\r\n\r\n   [2083] The comparison may be between the darkening smoke of\r\n   the fire-arms and the heresy darkening pagan hearts.\r\n\r\n   [2084] There appears to be a distinction of title between the\r\n   _akhta-begī_ and the _mīr-akhẉūr_ (master of the horse).\r\n\r\n   [2085] Qorān, cap. 14, v. 33.\r\n\r\n   [2086] These two men were in one of the flanking-parties.\r\n\r\n   [2087] This phrase \"our brother\" would support the view that\r\n   Shaikh Zain wrote as for Bābur, if there were not, on the\r\n   other hand, mention of Bābur as His Majesty, and the precious\r\n   royal soul.\r\n\r\n   [2088] _dīwānīān_ here may mean those associated with the\r\n   wazīr in his duties: and not those attending at Court.\r\n\r\n   [2089] Qorān, cap. 14, v. 52.\r\n\r\n   [2090] Index _s.n. chuhra_ (a brave).\r\n\r\n   [2091] _hizabrān-i-besha yakrangī_, literally, forest-tigers\r\n   (or, lions) of one hue.\r\n\r\n   [2092] There may be reference here to the chains used to\r\n   connect the carts into a defence.\r\n\r\n   [2093] The braves of the _khāṣa tābīn_ were part of Bābur's\r\n   own centre.\r\n\r\n   [2094] perhaps the cataphract elephants; perhaps the men in\r\n   mail.\r\n\r\n   [2095] Qorān, cap. 101, v. 54.\r\n\r\n   [2096] Qorān, cap. 101, v. 4.\r\n\r\n   [2097] _bā andākhtan-i-sang u ẓarb-zan tufak bisyārī._ As\r\n   Bābur does not in any place mention metal missiles, it seems\r\n   safest to translate _sang_ by its plain meaning of _stone_.\r\n\r\n   [2098] Also, metaphorically, swords.\r\n\r\n   [2099] _tīr._ My husband thinks there is a play upon the two\r\n   meanings of this word, arrow and the planet Mercury; so too in\r\n   the next sentence, that there may be allusion in the _kuākib\r\n   s̤awābit_ to the constellation Pegasus, opposed to Bābur's\r\n   squadrons of horse.\r\n\r\n   [2100] The Fish mentioned in this verse is the one pictured by\r\n   Muḥammadan cosmogony as supporting the Earth. The violence of\r\n   the fray is illustrated by supposing that of Earth's seven\r\n   climes one rose to Heaven in dust, thus giving Heaven eight.\r\n   The verse is from Firdausī's _Shāh-nāma_, [Turner-Macan's ed.\r\n   i, 222]. The translation of it is Warner's, [ii, 15 and n.]. I\r\n   am indebted for the information given in this note to my\r\n   husband's long search in the _Shāh-nāmā_.\r\n\r\n   [2101] Qorān, cap. 3, v. 133.\r\n\r\n   [2102] Qorān, cap. 61, v. 13.\r\n\r\n   [2103] Qorān, cap. 48, v. 1.\r\n\r\n   [2104] Qorān, cap. 48, v. 3.\r\n\r\n   [2105] [see p. 572] _farāsh_. De Courteille, reading _firāsh_,\r\n   translates this metaphor by _comme un lit lorsqu'il est\r\n   défait_. He refers to Qorān, cap. 101, v. 3. A better metaphor\r\n   for the breaking up of an army than that of moths scattering,\r\n   one allowed by the word _farāsh_, but possibly not by\r\n   Muḥammad, is _vanished like bubbles on wine_.\r\n\r\n   [2106] Bāgar is an old name for Dungarpūr and Bānswāra [_G. of\r\n   I._ vi, 408 _s.n._ Bānṣwāra].\r\n\r\n   [2107] _sic_, Ḥai. MS. and may be so read in I.O. 217 f.\r\n   220_b___; Erskine writes Bikersi (p. 367) and notes the\r\n   variant Nagersi; Ilminsky (p. 421) N:krsī; de Courteille (ii.\r\n   307) Niguersi.\r\n\r\n   [2108] Cf. f. 318_b_, and note, where it is seen that the\r\n   stones which killed the lords of the Elephants were so small\r\n   as to be carried in the bill of a bird like a swallow. Were\r\n   such stones used in matchlocks in Bābur's day?\r\n\r\n   [2109] _guzāran_, var. _gurazān_, caused to flee and hogs\r\n   (Erskine notes the double-meaning).\r\n\r\n   [2110] This passage, entered in some MSS. as if verse, is made\r\n   up of Qorān, cap. 17, v. 49, cap. 33, v. 38, and cap. 3, v.\r\n   122.\r\n\r\n   [2111] As the day of battle was Jumāda II. 13th (March 16th),\r\n   the _Fatḥ-nāma_ was ready and dated twelve days after that\r\n   battle. It was started for Kābul on Rajab 9th (April 11th).\r\n   Something may be said here appropriately about the surmise\r\n   contained in Dr. Ilminsky's Preface and M. de Courteille's\r\n   note to _Mémoires_ ii, 443 and 450, to the effect that Bābur\r\n   wrote a plain account of the battle of Kanwā and for this in\r\n   his narrative substituted Shaikh Zain's _Fatḥ-nāma_, and that\r\n   the plain account has been preserved in Kehr's _Bābur-nāma_\r\n   volume [whence Ilminsky reproduced it, it was translated by M.\r\n   de Courteille and became known as a \"Fragment\" of Bāburiana].\r\n   Almost certainly both scholars would have judged adversely of\r\n   their suggestion by the light of to-day's easier research. The\r\n   following considerations making against its value, may be set\r\n   down:—\r\n\r\n   (1) There is no sign that Bābur ever wrote a plain account of\r\n   the battle or any account of it. There is against his doing so\r\n   his statement that he inserts Shaikh Zain's _Fatḥ-nāma_\r\n   because it gives particulars. If he had written any account,\r\n   it would be found preceding the _Fatḥ-nāma_, as his account of\r\n   his renunciation of wine precedes Shaikh Zain's _Farmān_\r\n   announcing the act.\r\n\r\n   (2) Moreover, the \"Fragment\" cannot be described as a plain\r\n   account such as would harmonize with Bābur's style; it is in\r\n   truth highly rhetorical, though less so as Shaikh Zain's.\r\n\r\n   (3) The \"Fragment\" begins with a quotation from the\r\n   _Bābur-nāma_ (f.310_b_ and n.), skips a good deal of Bābur's\r\n   matter preliminary to the battle, and passes on with what\r\n   there can be no doubt is a translation in inferior Turkī of\r\n   the _Akbar-nāma_ account.\r\n\r\n   (4) The whole of the extra matter is seen to be continuous and\r\n   not fragmentary, if it is collated with the chapter in which\r\n   Abū'l-faẓl describes the battle, its sequel of events, the\r\n   death, character, attainments, and Court of Bābur. Down to the\r\n   death, it is changed to the first person so as to make Bābur\r\n   seem to write it. The probable concocter of it is Jahāngīr.\r\n\r\n   (5) If the Fragment were Bābur's composition, where was it\r\n   when `Abdu-r-raḥīm translated the _Bābur-nāma_ in 998 AH.-1590\r\n   AD.; where too did Abū'l-faẓl find it to reproduce in the\r\n   _Akbar-nāma_?\r\n\r\n   (6) The source of Abū'l-faẓl's information seems without doubt\r\n   to be Bābur's own narrative and Shaikh Zain's _Fatḥ-nāma_.\r\n   There are many significant resemblances between the two\r\n   rhetoricians' metaphors and details selected.\r\n\r\n   (7) A good deal might be said of the dissimilarities between\r\n   Bābur's diction and that of the \"Fragment\". But this is\r\n   needless in face of the larger and more circumstantial\r\n   objections already mentioned.\r\n\r\n   (For a fuller account of the \"Fragment\" see JRAS. Jan. 1906\r\n   pp. 81, 85 and 1908 p. 75 ff.)\r\n\r\n   [2112] _T̤ughrā_ means an imperial signature also, but would\r\n   Bābur sign Shaikh Zain's _Fatḥ-i-nāma_? His autograph verse at\r\n   the end of the _Rāmpūr Dīwān_ has his signature following it.\r\n   He is likely to have signed this verse. Cf. App. Q. [Erskine\r\n   notes that titles were written on the back of despatches, an\r\n   unlikely place for the quatrain, one surmises.]\r\n\r\n   [2113] This is in the _Rāmpūr dīwān_ (E.D.R. Plate 17). Dr. E.\r\n   Denison Ross points out (p. 17 n.) that in the 2nd line the\r\n   Ḥai. Codex varies from the _Dīwān_. The MS. is wrong; it\r\n   contains many inaccuracies in the latter part of the Hindūstān\r\n   section, perhaps due to a change of scribe.\r\n\r\n   [2114] These words by _abjad_ yield 933. From Bābur's use of\r\n   the pluperfect tense, I think it may be inferred that (my)\r\n   Sections _a_ and _b_ are an attachment to the _Fatḥ-nāma_,\r\n   entered with it at a somewhat later date.\r\n\r\n   [2115] My translation of this puzzling sentence is tentative\r\n   only.\r\n\r\n   [2116] This statement shews that the Dībālpūr affair occurred\r\n   in one of the B.N. gaps, and in 930 AH. The words make 330 by\r\n   _abjad_. It may be noted here that on f. 312_b_ and notes\r\n   there are remarks concerning whether Bābur's remission of the\r\n   _tamghā_ was contingent on his winning at Kānwa. If the\r\n   remission had been delayed until his victory was won, it would\r\n   have found fitting mention with the other sequels of victory\r\n   chronicled above; as it is not with these sequels, it may be\r\n   accepted as an absolute remission, proclaimed before the\r\n   fight. The point was a little uncertain owing to the seemingly\r\n   somewhat deferred insertion in Bābur's narrative of Shaikh\r\n   Zain's _Farmān_.\r\n\r\n   [2117] _dā'ira_, presumably a defended circle. As the word\r\n   _aūrdū_ [bracketed in the text] shows, Bābur used it both for\r\n   his own and for Sangā's camps.\r\n\r\n   [2118] Hence the Rānā escaped. He died in this year, not\r\n   without suspicion of poison.\r\n\r\n   [2119] _aīchīmnī khālī qīldīm_, a seeming equivalent for\r\n   English, \"I poured out my spleen.\"\r\n\r\n   [2120] var. _malūk_ as _e.g._ in I.O. 217 f.225_b_, and also\r\n   elsewhere in the _Bābur-nāma_.\r\n\r\n   [2121] On f. 315 the acts attributed to Ilīās Khān are said to\r\n   have been done by a \"mannikin called Rustam Khān\". Neither\r\n   name appears elsewhere in the B.N.; the hero's name seems a\r\n   sarcasm on the small man.\r\n\r\n   [2122] Bābur so-calls both Ḥasan and his followers, presumably\r\n   because they followed their race sympathies, as of Rājpūt\r\n   origin, and fought against co-religionists. Though Ḥasan's\r\n   subjects, Meos, were nominally Muḥammadans, it appears that\r\n   they practised some Hindu customs. For an account of Mīwāt,\r\n   see _Gazetteer of Ulwur_ (Alwar, Alūr) by Major P. W. Powlett.\r\n\r\n   [2123] Alwar being in Mīwāt, Bābur may mean that bodies were\r\n   found beyond that town in the main portion of the Mīwāt\r\n   country which lies north of Alwar towards Dihlī.\r\n\r\n   [2124] Major Powlett speaking (p. 9) of the revenue Mīwāt paid\r\n   to Bābur, quotes Thomas as saying that the coins stated in\r\n   Bābur's Revenue Accounts, _viz._ 169,810,00 _tankas_ were\r\n   probably Sikandarī _tankas_, or Rs. 8,490,50.\r\n\r\n   [2125] This word appears to have been restricted in its use to\r\n   the Khān-zādas of the ruling house in Mīwāt, and was not used\r\n   for their subjects, the Meos (Powlett _l.c._ Cap. I.). The\r\n   uses of \"Mīwātī\" and \"Meo\" suggest something analogous with\r\n   those of \"Chaghatāī\" and \"Mughūl\" in Bābur's time. The\r\n   resemblance includes mutual dislike and distrust (Powlett\r\n   _l.c._).\r\n\r\n   [2126] _qīlūrlār aīkān dūr._ This presumptive past tense is\r\n   frequently used by the cautious Bābur. I quote it here and in\r\n   a few places near-following because it supports Shaw's\r\n   statement that in it the use of _aīkān_ (_īkān_) reduces the\r\n   positive affirmation of the perfect to presumption or rumour.\r\n   With this statement all grammarians are not agreed; it is\r\n   fully supported by the _Bābur-nāma_.\r\n\r\n   [2127] Contrast here is suggested between Sulṯāns of Dihlī &\r\n   Hind; is it between the greater Turks with whom Bābur classes\r\n   himself immediately below as a conqueror of Hind, and the Lūdī\r\n   Sulṯāns of Dihlī?\r\n\r\n   [2128] The strength of the Tijāra hills towards Dihlī is\r\n   historical (Powlett _l.c._ p. 132).\r\n\r\n   [2129] This is one of the names of the principal river which\r\n   flows eastwards to the south of Alwar town; other names are\r\n   Bārah and Rūparel. Powlett notes that it appears in Thorn's\r\n   Map of the battle of Laswarree (1803 AD.), which he reproduces\r\n   on p. 146. But it is still current in Gurgaon, with also a\r\n   variant Mānas-le, man-killer (_G. of Gurgaon_ 1910 AD. ivA,\r\n   p.6).\r\n\r\n   [2130] _aūltūrūrlār aīkān dūr_, the presumptive past tense.\r\n\r\n   [2131] f.308.\r\n\r\n   [2132] _qīlghān aīkān dūr_, the presumptive past tense.\r\n\r\n   [2133] _Sulṯān ātīghā juldū būlūb_; Pers. trs. _Juldū ba nām-i\r\n   Sulṯān shud_. The _juldū_ guerdon seems to be apart from the\r\n   fief and allowance.\r\n\r\n   [2134] f. 315.\r\n\r\n   [2135] Bābur does not record this detail (f. 315).\r\n\r\n   [2136] f. 298_b_ and f. 328_b_. Ja`far is mentioned as Mahdī's\r\n   son by Gul-badan and in the _Ḥabību's-siyar_ iii, 311, 312.\r\n\r\n   [2137] f. 388_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2138] The town of Fīrūzpūr is commonly known as\r\n   Fīrūzpūr-jhirka (Fīrūzpūr of the spring), from a small\r\n   perennial stream which issues from a number of fissures in the\r\n   rocks bordering the road through a pass in the Mīwāt hills\r\n   which leads from the town _viâ_ Tijāra to Rewārī (_G. of\r\n   Gurgaon_, p. 249). In Abū'l-faẓl's day there was a Hindū\r\n   shrine of Mahadeo near the spring, which is still a place of\r\n   annual pilgrimage. The Kūtila lake is called Kotla-_jhil_ in\r\n   the _G. of G._ (p. 7). It extends now 3 m. by 2-1/2 m. varying\r\n   in size with the season; in Abū'l-faẓl's day it was 4 _kos_ (8\r\n   m.) round. It lies partly in the district of Nūh, partly in\r\n   Gurgaon, where the two tracts join at the foot of the Alwar\r\n   hills.\r\n\r\n   [2139] This is the frequently mentioned size for reservoirs;\r\n   the measure here is probably the _qārī_, _cir._ a yard.\r\n\r\n   [2140] Bābur does not state it as a fact known to himself that\r\n   the Mānas-nī falls into the Kūtila lake; it did so formerly,\r\n   but now does not, tradition assigning a cause for the change\r\n   (_G. of G._ p. 6). He uses the hear-say tense, _kīrār aīmīsh_.\r\n\r\n   [2141] Kharī and Toda were in Akbar's _sarkār_ of Rantaṃbhor.\r\n\r\n   [2142] Bhosāwar is in Bhurtpūr, and Chausa (or Jūsa) may be\r\n   the Chausath of the _Āyīn-i-akbarī_, ii, 183.\r\n\r\n   [2143] As has been noted frequently, this phrase stands for\r\n   artificial water-courses.\r\n\r\n   [2144] Certainly Trans-Hindū-kush lands; presumably also those\r\n   of Trans-Indus, Kābul in chief.\r\n\r\n   [2145] _aūstī_; perhaps the reservoir was so built as to\r\n   contain the bubbling spring.\r\n\r\n   [2146] _Chūn jā'ī khẉush karda ām._\r\n\r\n   [2147] f. 315.\r\n\r\n   [2148] var. Janwār (Jarrett). It is 25 m. east of Āgra on the\r\n   Muttra-Etāwa road (_G. of I._).\r\n\r\n   [2149] _kūcha-band_, perhaps a barricade at the limit of a\r\n   suburban lane.\r\n\r\n   [2150] This has been mentioned already (f. 327).\r\n\r\n   [2151] f. 315.\r\n\r\n   [2152] _i.e._ those professedly held for Bābur.\r\n\r\n   [2153] Or, according to local pronunciation, Badāyūn.\r\n\r\n   [2154] This is the old name of Shāhābād in Rāmpūr (_G. of I._\r\n   xxii, 197). The _A.-i-A._ locates it in Saṃbal. Cf. E. and\r\n   D.'s _History of India_, iv, 384 n. and v. 215 n.\r\n\r\n   [2155] Perhaps the one in Sītapūr.\r\n\r\n   [2156] f. 305_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2157] As the Elphinstone Codex which is the treasure-house of\r\n   Humāyūn's notes, has a long _lacuna_ into which this episode\r\n   falls, it is not known if the culprit entered in his copy of\r\n   the _Bābur-nāma_ a marginal excuse for his misconduct (cf. f.\r\n   252 and n.); such excuse was likely to be that he knew he\r\n   would be forgiven by his clement father.\r\n\r\n   [2158] f. 305_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2159] Kāmrān would be in Qandahār. Erskine notes that the sum\r\n   sent to him would be about £750, but that if the coins were\r\n   rūpīs, it would be £30,000.\r\n\r\n   [2160] _qiṯa`_, for account of which form of poem _see_\r\n   Blochmann's translations of Saifī's and Jāmī's _Prosody_, p.\r\n   86.\r\n\r\n   [2161] _Rāmpūr Dīwān_ (E. D. Ross' ed. p. 16 and Plate 14_a_).\r\n   I am uncertain as to the meaning of ll. 4 and 10. I am not\r\n   sure that what in most MSS. ends line 4, _viz._ _aūl dam_,\r\n   should not be read as _aūlūm_, death; this is allowed by Plate\r\n   14a where for space the word is divided and may be _aūlūm_. To\r\n   read _aūlūm_ and that the deserters fled from the death in\r\n   Hind they were anxious about, has an answering phrase in \"we\r\n   still are alive\". Ll. 9 and 10 perhaps mean that in the things\r\n   named all have done alike. [Ilminsky reads _khāir nafsī_ for\r\n   the elsewhere _ḥaz̤z̤-nafsī_.]\r\n\r\n   [2162] These are 20 attitudes (_rak`ah_) assumed in prayer\r\n   during Ramẓān after the Bed-time Prayer. The ablution\r\n   (_ghusl_) is the bathing of the whole body for ceremonial\r\n   purification.\r\n\r\n   [2163] This Feast is the `Id-i-fiṯṛ, held at the breaking of\r\n   the Ramẓān Fast on the 1st of Shawwāl.\r\n\r\n   [2164] Erskine notes that this is the earliest mention of\r\n   playing-cards he can recall in oriental literature.\r\n\r\n   [2165] f. 339_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2166] The two varieties mentioned by Bābur seem to be\r\n   _Diospyrus melanoxylon_, the wood of which is called _tindu\r\n   abnūs_ in Hindūstānī, and _D. tomentosa_, Hindi, _tindu_\r\n   (Brandis _s.nn._). Bārī is 19 m. west of Dūlpūr.\r\n\r\n   [2167] _mī`ād_, perhaps the time at which the Shaikh was to\r\n   appear before Bābur.\r\n\r\n   [2168] The Pers. trs. makes the more definite statement that\r\n   what had to be read was a Section of the Qoran (_wird_). This\r\n   was done with remedial aim for the illness.\r\n\r\n   [2169] As this statement needs comment, and as it is linked to\r\n   matters mentioned in the _Rāmpūr Dīwān_, it seems better to\r\n   remit remarks upon it to Appendix Q, _Some matters concerning\r\n   the Rāmpūr Dīwān_.\r\n\r\n   [2170] _risāla._ _See_ Appendix Q.\r\n\r\n   [2171] Elph. MS. _lacuna_; I.O. 215 _lacuna_ and 217 f. 229;\r\n   Mems. p. 373. This year's narrative resumes the diary form.\r\n\r\n   [2172] There is some uncertainty about these names and also as\r\n   to which adversary crossed the river. The sentence which, I\r\n   think, shews, by its plural verb, that Humāyūn left two men\r\n   and, by its co-ordinate participles, that it was they crossed\r\n   the river, is as follows:—(Darwīsh and Yūsuf, understood)\r\n   _Quṯb Sīrwānī-nī u bīr pāra rājalār-nī bīr daryā aūtūb\r\n   aūrūshūb yakshī bāsīb tūrlār_. _Aūtūb_, _aūrūshūb_ and _bāsīb_\r\n   are grammatically referable to the same subject, [whatever was\r\n   the fact about the crossing].\r\n\r\n   [2173] _bīr daryā_; W.-i-B. 217 f. 229, _yak daryā_, one\r\n   river, but many MSS. _har daryā_, every river. If it did not\r\n   seem pretty certain that the rebels were not in the\r\n   Miyān-dū-āb one would surmise the river to be \"one river\" of\r\n   the two enclosing the tract \"between the waters\", and that one\r\n   to be the Ganges. It may be one near Saṃbhal, east of the\r\n   Ganges.\r\n\r\n   [2174] var. Shīrwānī. The place giving the cognomen may be\r\n   Sarwān, a _thakurāt_ of the Mālwā Agency (_G. of I._). Quṯb of\r\n   Sīrwān may be the Quṯb Khān of earlier mention without the\r\n   cognomen.\r\n\r\n   [2175] n.w. of Aligarh (Kūl). It may be noted here, where\r\n   instances begin to be frequent, that my translation \"we\r\n   marched\" is an evasion of the Turkī impersonal \"it was\r\n   marched\". Most rarely does Bābur write \"we marched\", never, \"I\r\n   marched.\"\r\n\r\n   [2176] in the Aligarh (Kūl) district; it is the Sikandara Rao\r\n   of the _A.-i-A._ and the _G. of I._\r\n\r\n   [2177] _Rāmpūr Dīwān_ (E. D. Ross' ed., p. 19, Plate 16_b_).\r\n   This _Dīwān_ contains other quatrains which, judging from\r\n   their contents, may well be those Bābur speaks of as also\r\n   composed in Saṃbal. _See_ Appendix Q, _Some matters concerning\r\n   the Rāmpūr Dīwān_.\r\n\r\n   [2178] These are aunts of Bābur, daughters of Sl. Abū-sa`īd\r\n   _Mīrān-shāhī_.\r\n\r\n   [2179] Sikandarābād is in the Buland-shahr district of the\r\n   United Provinces.\r\n\r\n   [2180] It is not clear whether Bābur returned from Sīkrī on\r\n   the day he started for Jalīsīr; no question of distance would\r\n   prevent him from making the two journeys on the Monday.\r\n\r\n   [2181] As this was the rendezvous for the army, it would be\r\n   convenient if it lay between Āgra and Anwār; as it was 6 m.\r\n   from Āgra, the only mapped place having approximately the name\r\n   Jalīsīr, _viz._ Jalesar, in Etah, seems too far away.\r\n\r\n   [2182] Anwār would be suitably the Unwāra of the _Indian\r\n   Atlas_, which is on the first important southward dip of the\r\n   Jumna below Āgra. Chandwār is 25 m. east of Āgra, on the\r\n   Muttra-Etāwah road (_G. of I._); Jarrett notes that\r\n   Tiefenthaler identifies it with Fīrūzābād (_A.-i-A._ ii, 183\r\n   n.).\r\n\r\n   [2183] In the district of Kālpī. The name does not appear in\r\n   maps I have seen.\r\n\r\n   [2184] _āghā_, Anglicé, uncle. He was Sa`īd Khān of Kāshghar.\r\n   Ḥaidar M. says Bābā Sl. was a spoiled child and died without\r\n   mending his ways.\r\n\r\n   [2185] From Kālpī Bābur will have taken the road to the s.w.\r\n   near which now runs the Cawnpur (Kānhpūr) branch of the Indian\r\n   Midland Railway, and he must have crossed the Betwa to reach\r\n   Īrij (Irich, _Indian Atlas_, Sheet 69 N.W.).\r\n\r\n   [2186] Leaving Īrij, Bābur will have recrossed the Betwa and\r\n   have left its valley to go west to Bāndīr (Bhander) on the\r\n   Pahūj (_Indian Atlas_, Sheet 69 S.W.).\r\n\r\n   [2187] beneficent, or Muḥassan, comely.\r\n\r\n   [2188] The one man of this name mentioned in the _B.N._ is an\r\n   amīr of Sl. Ḥusain _Bāī-qarā_.\r\n\r\n   [2189] It seems safe to take Kachwa [Kajwa] as the Kajwarra of\r\n   Ibn Batūta, and the Kadwāha (Kadwaia) of the _Indian Atlas_,\r\n   Sheet 52 N.E. and of Luard's _Gazetteer_ _of Gwalior_ (i,\r\n   247), which is situated in 24° 58' N. and 77° 57' E. Each of\r\n   the three names is of a place standing on a lake; Ibn Batūta's\r\n   lake was a league (4 m.) long, Bābur's about 11 miles round;\r\n   Luard mentions no lake, but the _Indian Atlas_ marks one quite\r\n   close to Kadwāha of such form as to seem to have a tongue of\r\n   land jutting into it from the north-west, and thus suiting\r\n   Bābur's description of the site of Kachwa. Again,—Ibn Batūta\r\n   writes of Kajwarra as having, round its lake, idol-temples;\r\n   Luard says of Kadwāha that it has four idol-temples standing\r\n   and nine in ruins; there may be hinted something special about\r\n   Bābur's Kachwa by his remark that he encouraged its people,\r\n   and this speciality may be interaction between Muḥammadanism\r\n   and Hindūism serving here for the purpose of identification.\r\n   For Ibn Batūta writes of the people of Kajwarra that they were\r\n   _jogīs_, yellowed by asceticism, wearing their hair long and\r\n   matted, and having Muḥammadan followers who desired to learn\r\n   their (occult?) secrets. If the same interaction existed in\r\n   Bābur's day, the Muḥammadan following of the Hindū ascetics\r\n   may well have been the special circumstance which led him to\r\n   promise protection to those Hindūs, even when he was out for\r\n   Holy-war. It has to be remembered of Chandīrī, the nearest\r\n   powerful neighbour of Kadwāha, that though Bābur's capture\r\n   makes a vivid picture of Hindūism in it, it had been under\r\n   Muḥammadan rulers down to a relatively short time before his\r\n   conquest. The _jogīs_ of Kachwa could point to long-standing\r\n   relations of tolerance by the Chandīrī Governors; this, with\r\n   their Muḥammadan following, explains the encouragement Bābur\r\n   gave them, and helps to identify Kachwa with Kajarra. It may\r\n   be observed that Bābur was familiar with the interaction of\r\n   the two creeds, witness his \"apostates\", mostly Muḥammadans\r\n   following Hindū customs, witness too, for the persistent fact,\r\n   the reports of District-officers under the British _Rāj_.\r\n   Again,—a further circumstance helping to identify Kajwarra,\r\n   Kachwa and Kadwāha is that these are names of the last\r\n   important station the traveller and the soldier, as well\r\n   perhaps as the modern wayfarer, stays in before reaching\r\n   Chandīrī. The importance of Kajwarra is shewn by Ibn Batūta,\r\n   and of Kadwāha by its being a _maḥāll_ in Akbar's _sarkār_ of\r\n   Bāyawān of the _ṣūba_ of Āgra. Again,—Kadwāha is the place\r\n   nearest to Chandīrī about which Bābur's difficulties as to\r\n   intermediate road and jungle would arise. That intermediate\r\n   road takes off the main one a little south of Kadwāha and runs\r\n   through what looks like a narrow valley and broken country\r\n   down to Bhamor, Bhurānpūr and Chandīrī. Again,—no bar to\r\n   identification of the three names is placed by their\r\n   differences of form, in consideration of the vicissitudes they\r\n   have weathered in tongue, script, and transliteration. There\r\n   is some ground, I believe, for surmising that their common\r\n   source is _kajūr_, the date-fruit. [I am indebted to my\r\n   husband for the help derived from Ibn Batūta, traced by him in\r\n   Sanguinetti's trs. iv, 33, and S. Lee's trs. p. 162.]\r\n\r\n   (Two places similar in name to Kachwa, and situated on Bābur's\r\n   route _viz._ Kocha near Jhansi, and Kuchoowa north of Kadwāha\r\n   (Sheet 69 S.W.) are unsuitable for his \"Kachwa\", the first\r\n   because too near Bandīr to suit his itinerary, the second\r\n   because too far from the turn off the main-road mentioned\r\n   above, because it has no lake, and has not the help in\r\n   identification detailed above of Kadwāha.)\r\n\r\n   [2190] _qūrūghīr_ which could mean also _reserved_ (from the\r\n   water?).\r\n\r\n   [2191] _qāzān._ There seems to have been one only; how few\r\n   Bābur had is shewn again on f. 337.\r\n\r\n   [2192] _Indian Atlas_, Sheet 52 N.E. near a tributary of the\r\n   Betwa, the Or, which appears to be Bābur's Burhānpūr-water.\r\n\r\n   [2193] The bed of the Betwa opposite Chandīrī is 1050 ft.\r\n   above the sea; the walled-town (_qūrghān_) of Chandīrī is on a\r\n   table-land 250 ft. higher, and its citadel is 230 ft. higher\r\n   again (Cunningham's _Archeological Survey Report_, 1871 A.D.\r\n   ii, 404).\r\n\r\n   [2194] The plan of Chandīrī illustrating Cunningham's Report\r\n   (_see_ last note) allows surmise about the road taken by\r\n   Bābur, surmise which could become knowledge if the names of\r\n   tanks he gives were still known. The courtesy of the\r\n   Government of India allows me to reproduce that plan [Appendix\r\n   R, _Chandīrī_ and _Gwālīāwar]_.\r\n\r\n   [2195] He is said to have been Governor of Chandīrī in 1513\r\n   AD.\r\n\r\n   [2196] Here and in similar passages the word _m:ljār_ or\r\n   _m:lchār_ is found in MSS. where the meaning is that of T.\r\n   _būljār_. It is not in any dictionary I have seen; Mr. Irvine\r\n   found it \"obscure\" and surmised it to mean \"approach by\r\n   trenches\", but this does not suit its uses in the _Bābur-nāma_\r\n   of a military post, and a rendezvous. This surmise,\r\n   containing, as it does, a notion of protection, links _m:ljār_\r\n   in sense with Ar. _malja'_. The word needs expert\r\n   consideration, in order to decide whether it is to be received\r\n   into dictionaries, or to be rejected because explicable as the\r\n   outcome of unfamiliarity in Persian scribes with T. _būljār_\r\n   or, _more Persico_ with narrowed vowels, _bŭljăr_. Shaw in his\r\n   Vocabulary enters _būljāq_ (_būljār_?), \"a station for troops,\r\n   a rendezvous, see _malja'_,\" thus indicating, it would seem,\r\n   that he was aware of difficulty about _m:ljār_ and _būljāq_\r\n   (_būljār_?). There appears no doubt of the existence of a\r\n   Turkī word _būljār_ with the meanings Shaw gives to _būljāq_;\r\n   it could well be formed from the root _būl_, being, whence\r\n   follows, being in a place, posted. _Maljā_ has the meaning of\r\n   a standing-place, as well as those of a refuge and an asylum;\r\n   both meanings seem combined in the _m:ljār_ of f. 336_b_,\r\n   where for matchlockmen a _m:ljār_ was ordered \"raised\". (Cf.\r\n   Irvine's _Army of the Indian Moghuls_ p. 278.)\r\n\r\n   [2197] _yāghdā_; Pers. trs. _sar-āshīb_. Bābur's remark seems\r\n   to show that for effect his mortar needed to be higher than\r\n   its object. Presumably it stood on the table-land north of the\r\n   citadel.\r\n\r\n   [2198] _shātū._ It may be noted that this word, common in\r\n   accounts of Bābur's sieges, may explain one our friend the\r\n   late Mr. William Irvine left undecided (_l.c._ p. 278), _viz._\r\n   _shāṯūr_. On p. 281 he states that _nardubān_ is the name of a\r\n   scaling-ladder and that Bābur mentions scaling ladders more\r\n   than once. Bābur mentions them however always as _shātū_.\r\n   Perhaps _shāṯūr_ which, as Mr. Irvine says, seems to be made\r\n   of the trunks of trees and to be a siege appliance, is really\r\n   _shātū u_ ... (ladder and ...) as in the passage under note\r\n   and on f. 216_b_, some other name of an appliance following.\r\n\r\n   [2199] The word here preceding _tūra_ has puzzled scribes and\r\n   translators. I have seen the following variants in\r\n   MSS.;—_nūkrī_ or _tūkrī_, _b:krī_ or _y:krī_, _būkrī_ or\r\n   _yūkrī_, _būkrāī_ or _yūkrāī_, in each of which the _k_ may\r\n   stand for _g_. Various suggestions might be made as to what\r\n   the word is, but all involve reading the Persian enclitic _ī_\r\n   (forming the adjective) instead of Turkī _līk_. Two roots,\r\n   _tīg_ and _yūg_, afford plausible explanations of the unknown\r\n   word; appliances suiting the case and able to bear names\r\n   formed from one or other of these roots are _wheeled\r\n   mantelet_, and _head-strike_ (P. _sar-kob_). That the word is\r\n   difficult is shewn not only by the variants I have quoted, but\r\n   by Erskine's reading _naukarī tūra_, \"to serve the _tūras_,\" a\r\n   requisite not specified earlier by Bābur, and by de\r\n   Courteille's paraphrase, _tout ce qui est nécessaire aux\r\n   touras_.\r\n\r\n   [2200] Sl. Nāṣiru'd-dīn was the Khīljī ruler of Mālwā from 906\r\n   to 916 A.H. (1500-1510 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [2201] He was a Rājpūt who had been prime-minister of Sl.\r\n   Maḥmūd II. _Khīljī_ (son of Nāṣīru'd-dīn) and had rebelled.\r\n   Bābur (like some other writers) spells his name Mindnī,\r\n   perhaps as he heard it spoken.\r\n\r\n   [2202] Presumably the one in the United Provinces. For\r\n   Shamsābād in Gūālīār _see_ Luard _l.c._ i, 286.\r\n\r\n   [2203] _chīqtī_; Pers. trs. _bar āmad_ and, also in some MSS.\r\n   _namī bar āmad_; Mems. p. 376, \"averse to conciliation\";\r\n   _Méms._ ii, 329, \"_s'élevèrent contre cette proposition_.\" So\r\n   far I have not found Bābur using the verb _chīqmāq_\r\n   metaphorically. It is his frequent verb to express \"getting\r\n   away\", \"going out of a fort\". It would be a short step in\r\n   metaphor to understand here that Medinī's men \"got out of it\",\r\n   _i.e._ what Bābur offered. They may have left the fort also;\r\n   if so, it would be through dissent.\r\n\r\n   [2204] f. 332.\r\n\r\n   [2205] I.O. 217, f. 231, inserts here what seems a gloss, \"_Tā\r\n   īn jā Farsī farmūda_\" (_gufta_, said). As Bābur enters his\r\n   speech in Persian, it is manifest that he used Persian to\r\n   conceal the bad news.\r\n\r\n   [2206] The _Illustrated London News_ of July 10th, 1915 (on\r\n   which day this note is written), has an àpropos picture of an\r\n   ancient fortress-gun, with its stone-ammunition, taken by the\r\n   Allies in a Dardanelles fort.\r\n\r\n   [2207] The _dū-tahī_ is the _āb-duzd_, water-thief, of f. 67.\r\n   Its position can be surmised from Cunningham's Plan [Appendix\r\n   R].\r\n\r\n   [2208] For Bābur's use of hand (_qūl_) as a military term\r\n   _see_ f. 209.\r\n\r\n   [2209] His full designation would be Shāh Muḥammad _yūz-begī_.\r\n\r\n   [2210] This will be flight from the ramparts to other places\r\n   in the fort.\r\n\r\n   [2211] Bābur's account of the siege of Chandīrī is incomplete,\r\n   inasmuch as it says nothing of the general massacre of pagans\r\n   he has mentioned on f. 272. Khẉāfī Khān records the massacre,\r\n   saying, that after the fort was surrendered, as was done on\r\n   condition of safety for the garrison, from 3 to 4000 pagans\r\n   were put to death by Bābur's troops on account of hostility\r\n   shewn during the evacuation of the fort. The time assigned to\r\n   the massacre is previous to the _jūhar_ of 1000 women and\r\n   children and the self-slaughter of men in Medinī Rāo's house,\r\n   in which he himself died. It is not easy to fit the two\r\n   accounts in; this might be done, however, by supposing that a\r\n   folio of Bābur's MS. was lost, as others seem lost at the end\r\n   of the narrative of this year's events (_q.v._). The lost\r\n   folio would tell of the surrender, one clearly affecting the\r\n   mass of Rājpūt followers and not the chiefs who stood for\r\n   victory or death and who may have made sacrifice to honour\r\n   after hearing of the surrender. Bābur's narrative in this part\r\n   certainly reads less consecutive than is usual with him;\r\n   something preceding his account of the _jūhar_ would improve\r\n   it, and would serve another purpose also, since mention of the\r\n   surrender would fix a term ending the now too short time of\r\n   under one hour he assigns as the duration of the fighting. If\r\n   a surrender had been mentioned, it would be clear that his \"2\r\n   or 3 _garīs_\" included the attacking and taking of the\r\n   _dū-tahī_ and down to the retreat of the Rājpūts from the\r\n   walls. On this Bābur's narrative of the unavailing sacrifice\r\n   of the chiefs would follow in due order. Khẉāfī Khān is more\r\n   circumstantial than Firishta who says nothing of surrender or\r\n   massacre, but states that 6000 men were killed fighting.\r\n   Khẉāfī Khān's authorities may throw light on the matter, which\r\n   so far does not hang well together in any narrative, Bābur's,\r\n   Firishta's, or Khẉāfī Khān's. One would like to know what led\r\n   such a large body of Rājpūts to surrender so quickly; had they\r\n   been all through in favour of accepting terms? One wonders,\r\n   again, why from 3 to 4000 Rājpūts did not put up a better\r\n   resistance to massacre. Perhaps their assailants were Turks,\r\n   stubborn fighters down to 1915 AD.\r\n\r\n   [2212] For suggestion about the brevity of this period, _see_\r\n   last note.\r\n\r\n   [2213] Clearly, without Bābur's taking part in the fighting.\r\n\r\n   [2214] These words by _abjad_ make 934. The Ḥai. MS.\r\n   mistakenly writes _Būd Chandīrī_ in the first line of the\r\n   quatrain instead of _Būd chandī_. Khẉāfī Khān quotes the\r\n   quatrain with slight variants.\r\n\r\n   [2215] _Chandīrī ṯaurī wilāyat_ (_dā_?) _wāqī` būlūb tūr_,\r\n   which seems to need _dā_, in, because the fort, and not the\r\n   country, is described. Or there may be an omission _e.g._ of a\r\n   second sentence about the walled-town (fort).\r\n\r\n   [2216] This is the \"Kirat-sagar\" of Cunningham's Plan of\r\n   Chandīrī; it is mentioned under this name by Luard (_l.c._ i,\r\n   210). \"Kirat\" represents Kirtī or Kirit Sīngh who ruled in\r\n   Gūālīār from 1455 to 1479 AD., there also making a tank\r\n   (Luard, _l.c._ i, 232).\r\n\r\n   [2217] For illustrative photographs _see_ Luard, _l.c._ vol.\r\n   i, part iv.\r\n\r\n   [2218] I have taken this sentence to apply to the location of\r\n   the tanks, but with some doubt; they are on the table-land.\r\n\r\n   [2219] Bābur appears to have written Betwī, this form being in\r\n   MSS. I have read the name to be that of the river Betwa which\r\n   is at a considerable distance from the fort. But some writers\r\n   dispraise its waters where Bābur praises.\r\n\r\n   [2220] T. _qīā_ means a slope or slant; here it may describe\r\n   tilted _strata_, such as would provide slabs for roofing and\r\n   split easily for building purposes. (_See_ next note.)\r\n\r\n   [2221] _`imārat qīlmāq munāsib_. This has been read to mean\r\n   that the _qīālar_ provide good sites (Mems. & _Méms._), but\r\n   position, distance from the protection of the fort, and the\r\n   merit of local stone for building incline me to read the words\r\n   quoted above as referring to the convenient lie of the stone\r\n   for building purposes. (_See_ preceding note.)\r\n\r\n   [2222] _Chandīrī-dā judai (jady)-nīng irtiqā`ī yīgīrma-bīsh\r\n   darja dūr_; Erskine, p. 378, Chanderi is situated in the 25th\r\n   degree of N. latitude; de Courteille, ii, 334, _La hauteur du\r\n   Capricorne à Tchanderi est de 25 degrées_. The latitude of\r\n   Chandīrī, it may be noted, is 24° 43'. It does not appear to\r\n   me indisputable that what Bābur says here is a statement of\r\n   latitude. The word _judai_ (or _jady_) means both Pole-star\r\n   and the Sign Capricorn. M. de Courteille translates the quoted\r\n   sentence as I have done, but with Capricorn for Pole-star. My\r\n   acquaintance with such expressions in French does not allow me\r\n   to know whether his words are a statement of latitude. It\r\n   occurs to me against this being so, that Bābur uses other\r\n   words when he gives the latitude of Samarkand (f. 44_b_); and\r\n   also that he has shewn attention to the Pole-star as a guide\r\n   on a journey (f. 203, where he uses the more common word\r\n   _Quṯb_). Perhaps he notes its lower altitude when he is far\r\n   south, in the way he noted the first rise of Canopus to his\r\n   view (f. 125).\r\n\r\n   [2223] Mallū Khān was a noble of Mālwā, who became ruler of\r\n   Mālwā in 1532 or 1533 AD. [?], under the style of Qādir Shāh.\r\n\r\n   [2224] _i.e._ paid direct to the royal treasury.\r\n\r\n   [2225] This is the one concerning which bad news reached Bābur\r\n   just before Chandīrī was taken.\r\n\r\n   [2226] This presumably is the place offered to Medinī Rāo (f.\r\n   333_b_), and Bikramājīt (f. 343).\r\n\r\n   [2227] Obviously for the bridge.\r\n\r\n   [2228] _m:ljār_ (_see_ f. 333 n.). Here the word would mean\r\n   befittingly a protected standing-place, a refuge, such as\r\n   matchlockmen used (f. 217 and Index _s.n._ _arāba_).\r\n\r\n   [2229] _sīghīrūrdī_, a vowel-variant, perhaps, of\r\n   _sūghūrūrdī_.\r\n\r\n   [2230] f. 331_b_. This passage shews that Bābur's mortars were\r\n   few.\r\n\r\n   [2231] _nufūr qūl-lār-dīn ham karka bīla rah rawā kīshī u āt\r\n   aītīlār_, a difficult sentence.\r\n\r\n   [2232] _Afghānlār kūprūk bāghlāmāq-nī istib`ād qīlīb tamaskhur\r\n   qīlūrlār aīkāndūr._ The ridicule will have been at slow\r\n   progress, not at the bridge-making itself, since\r\n   pontoon-bridges were common (Irvine's _Army of the Indian\r\n   Moghuls_).\r\n\r\n   [2233] _tūīlāb_; Pers. trs. _uftān u khezān_, limping, or\r\n   falling and rising, a translation raising doubt, because such\r\n   a mode of progression could hardly have allowed escape from\r\n   pursuers.\r\n\r\n   [2234] Anglicé, on Friday night.\r\n\r\n   [2235] According to the Persian calendar, New-year's-day is\r\n   that on which the Sun enters Aries.\r\n\r\n   [2236] so-spelled in the Ḥai. MS.; by de Courteille\r\n   Banguermādū; the two forms may represent the same one of the\r\n   Arabic script.\r\n\r\n   [2237] or Gūī, from the context clearly the Gumti. Jarrett\r\n   gives Godi as a name of the Gumti; Gūī and Godī may be the\r\n   same word in the Arabic script.\r\n\r\n   [2238] Some MSS. read that there was not much pain.\r\n\r\n   [2239] I take this to be the Kali-Sarda-Chauka affluent of the\r\n   Gogra and not its Sarju or Saru one. To so take it seems\r\n   warranted by the context; there could be no need for the fords\r\n   on the Sarju to be examined, and its position is not suitable.\r\n\r\n   [2240] Unfortunately no record of the hunting-expedition\r\n   survives.\r\n\r\n   [2241] One historian, Aḥmad-i-yādgār states in his\r\n   _Tārīkh-i-salāṯīn-i-afāghina_ that Bābur went to Lāhor\r\n   immediately after his capture of Chandīrī, and on his return\r\n   journey to Āgra suppressed in the Panj-āb a rising of the\r\n   Mundāhar (or, Mandhar) Rājpūts. His date is discredited by\r\n   Bābur's existing narrative of 934 AH. as also by the absence\r\n   in 935 AH. of allusion to either episode. My husband who has\r\n   considered the matter, advises me that the Lāhor visit may\r\n   have been made in 936 or early in 937 AH. [These are a period\r\n   of which the record is lost or, less probably, was not\r\n   written.]\r\n\r\n   [2242] Elph. MS. f. 262; I. O. 215 f. 207b and 217 f. 234_b_;\r\n   _Mems._ p. 382.

MS. f. 312_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2243] _See_ Appendix S:—_Concerning the dating of_ 935 AH.\r\n\r\n   [2244] `Askarī was now about 12 years old. He was succeeded in\r\n   Multān by his elder brother Kāmrān, transferred from Qandahār\r\n   [Index; JRAS. 1908 p. 829 para. (1)]. This transfer, it is\r\n   safe to say, was due to Bābur's resolve to keep Kābul in his\r\n   own hands, a resolve which his letters to Humāyūn (f. 348), to\r\n   Kāmrān (f. 359), and to Khwāja Kalān (f. 359) attest, as well\r\n   as do the movements of his family at this time. What would\r\n   make the stronger government of Kāmrān seem now more \"for the\r\n   good of Multān\" than that of the child `Askarī are the Bīlūchī\r\n   incursions, mentioned somewhat later (f. 355_b_) as having\r\n   then occurred more than once.\r\n\r\n   [2245] This will be his own house in the\r\n   Garden-of-eight-paradises, the Chār-bāgh begun in 932 AH.\r\n   (August 1526 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [2246] To this name Khwānd-amīr adds Aḥmadu'l-ḥaqīrī, perhaps\r\n   a pen-name; he also quotes verses of Shihāb's\r\n   (_Ḥabību's-siyar_ lith. ed. iii, 350).\r\n\r\n   [2247] Khwānd-amīr's account of his going into Hindūstān is\r\n   that he left his \"dear home\" (Herāt) for Qandahār in\r\n   mid-Shawwāl 933 AH. (mid-July 1527 AD.); that on Jumāda I.\r\n   10th 934 AH. (Feb. 1st 1528 AD.) he set out from Qandahār on\r\n   the hazardous journey into Hindūstān; and that owing to the\r\n   distance, heat, setting-in of the Rains, and breadth of rapid\r\n   rivers, he was seven months on the way. He mentions no\r\n   fellow-travellers, but he gives as the day of his arrival in\r\n   Āgra the one on which Bābur says he presented himself at\r\n   Court. (For an account of annoyances and misfortunes to which\r\n   he was subjected under Aūzbeg rule in Herāt _see Journal des\r\n   Savans_, July 1843, pp. 389, 393, Quatremère's art.)\r\n\r\n   [2248] Concerning Gūālīār _see_ Cunningham's _Archeological\r\n   Survey Reports_ vol. ii; Louis Rousselet's _L'Inde des Rajas_;\r\n   Lepel Griffin's _Famous Monuments of Central India_,\r\n   especially for its photographs; _Gazetteer of India_; Luard's\r\n   _Gazetteer of Gwalior_, text and photographs; _Travels of\r\n   Peter Mundy_, Hakluyt Society ed. R. C. Temple, ii, 61,\r\n   especially for its picture of the fort and note (p. 62)\r\n   enumerating early writers on Gūālīār. Of Persian books there\r\n   is Jalāl _Ḥiṣārī's Tārīkh-i-Gwālīāwar_ (B.M. Add. 16,859) and\r\n   Hirāman's (B.M. Add. 16,709) unacknowledged version of it,\r\n   which is of the B.M. MSS. the more legible.\r\n\r\n   [2249] Perhaps this stands for Gwālīāwar, the form seeming to\r\n   be used by Jalāl _Ḥiṣārī_, and having good traditional support\r\n   (Cunningham p. 373 and Luard p. 228).\r\n\r\n   [2250] _tūshlānīb_, _i.e._ they took rest and food together at\r\n   mid-day.\r\n\r\n   [2251] This seems to be the conjoined Gambhīr and Bāngānga\r\n   which is crossed by the Āgra-Dhūlpūr road (_G. of I._ Atlas,\r\n   Sheet 34).\r\n\r\n   [2252] _aīchtūq_, the plural of which shews that more than one\r\n   partook of the powders (_safūf_).\r\n\r\n   [2253] T. _tālqān_, Hindī _sattu_ (Shaw). M. de Courteille's\r\n   variant translation may be due to his reading for _tālqān_,\r\n   _tālghāq_, _flot_, _agitation_ (his Dict. _s.n._) and _yīl_,\r\n   wind, for _bīla_, with.\r\n\r\n   [2254] in 933 AH. f. 330_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2255] \"Each beaked promontory\" (Lycidas). Our name\r\n   \"Selsey-bill\" is an English instance of Bābur's (not\r\n   infrequent) _tūmshūq_, beak, bill of a bird.\r\n\r\n   [2256] No order about this Chār-bāgh is in existing annals of\r\n   934 AH. Such order is likely to have been given after Bābur's\r\n   return from his operations against the Afghāns, in his account\r\n   of which the annals of 934 AH. break off.\r\n\r\n   [2257] The fort-hill at the northern end is 300 ft. high, at\r\n   the southern end, 274 ft.; its length from north to south is\r\n   1-3/4 m.; its breadth varies from 600 ft. opposite the main\r\n   entrance (Hātī-pūl) to 2,800 ft. in the middle opposite the\r\n   great temple (Sās-bhao). Cf. Cunningham p. 330 and Appendix R,\r\n   _in loco_, for his Plan of Gūālīār.\r\n\r\n   [2258] This Arabic plural may have been prompted by the\r\n   greatness and distinction of Mān-sing's constructions. Cf.\r\n   Index _s.nn._ _begāt_ and _bāghāt_.\r\n\r\n   [2259] A translation point concerning the (Arabic) word\r\n   _`imārat_ is that the words \"palace\", \"_palais_\", and\r\n   \"residence\" used for it respectively by Erskine, de\r\n   Courteille, and, previous to the Hindūstān Section, by myself,\r\n   are too limited in meaning to serve for Bābur's uses of it in\r\n   Hindūstān; and this (1) because he uses it throughout his\r\n   writings for buildings under palatial rank (_e.g._ those of\r\n   high and low in Chandīrī); (2) because he uses it in Hindūstān\r\n   for non-residential buildings (_e.g._ for the Bādalgarh\r\n   outwork, f. 341_b_, and a Hindū temple _ib._); and (3) because\r\n   he uses it for the word \"building\" in the term building-stone,\r\n   f. 335_b_ and f. 339_b_. _Building_ is the comprehensive word\r\n   under which all his uses of it group. For labouring this point\r\n   a truism pleads my excuse, namely, that a man's vocabulary\r\n   being characteristic of himself, for a translator to increase\r\n   or diminish it is to intrude on his personality, and this the\r\n   more when an autobiography is concerned. Hence my search here\r\n   (as elsewhere) for an English grouping word is part of an\r\n   endeavour to restrict the vocabulary of my translation to the\r\n   limits of my author's.\r\n\r\n   [2260] Jalāl _Ḥiṣārī_ describes \"Khwāja Raḥīm-dād\" as a\r\n   paternal-nephew of Mahdī Khwāja. Neither man has been\r\n   introduced by Bābur, as it is his rule to introduce when he\r\n   first mentions a person of importance, by particulars of\r\n   family, _etc._ Both men became disloyal in 935 AH. (1529 AD.)\r\n   as will be found referred to by Bābur. Jalāl _Ḥiṣārī_\r\n   supplements Bābur's brief account of their misconduct and\r\n   Shaikh Muḥammad _Ghaus̤'_ mediation in 936 AH. For knowledge\r\n   of his contribution I am indebted to my husband's perusal of\r\n   the _Tārīkh-i-Gwālīāwar_.\r\n\r\n   [2261] Erskine notes that Indians and Persians regard\r\n   moonshine as cold but this only faintly expresses the\r\n   wide-spread fear of moon-stroke expressed in the Psalm (121 v.\r\n   6), \"The Sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the Moon by\r\n   night.\"\r\n\r\n   [2262] _Agarcha lūk balūk u bī sīyāq._ Ilminsky [p. 441] has\r\n   _balūk balūk_ but without textual warrant and perhaps\r\n   following Erskine, as he says, speaking generally, that he has\r\n   done in case of need (Ilminsky's Preface). Both Erskine and de\r\n   Courteille, working, it must be remembered, without the help\r\n   of detailed modern descriptions and pictures, took the above\r\n   words to say that the buildings were scattered and without\r\n   symmetry, but they are not scattered and certainly Mān-sing's\r\n   has symmetry. I surmise that the words quoted above do not\r\n   refer to the buildings themselves but to the stones of which\r\n   they are made. T. _lūk_ means heavy, and T. _balūk_ [? block]\r\n   means a thing divided off, here a block of stone. Such blocks\r\n   might be _bī sīyāq_, _i.e._ irregular in size. To take the\r\n   words in this way does not contradict known circumstances, and\r\n   is verbally correct.\r\n\r\n   [2263] The Rājas' buildings Bābur could compare were Rāja\r\n   Karna (or Kirtī)'s [who ruled from 1454 to 1479 AD.], Rāja\r\n   Mān-sing's [1486 to 1516 AD.], and Rāja Bikramājīt's [1516 to\r\n   1526 AD. when he was killed at Panīpat].\r\n\r\n   [2264] The height of the eastern face is 100 ft. and of the\r\n   western 60 ft. The total length from north to south of the\r\n   outside wall is 300 ft.; the breadth of the residence from\r\n   east to west 160 ft. The 300 ft. of length appears to be that\r\n   of the residence and service-courtyard (Cunningham p. 347 and\r\n   Plate lxxxvii).\r\n\r\n   [2265] _kaj bīla āqārītīb._ There can be little doubt that a\r\n   white pediment would show up the coloured tiles of the upper\r\n   part of the palace-walls more than would pale red sandstone.\r\n   These tiles were so profuse as to name the building Chīt\r\n   Mandīr (Painted Mandīr). Guided by Bābur's statement,\r\n   Cunningham sought for and found plaster in crevices of carved\r\n   work; from which one surmises that the white coating approved\r\n   itself to successors of Mān-sing. [It may be noted that the\r\n   word Mandīr is in the same case for a translator as is\r\n   _`imārat_ (f. 339_b_ n.) since it requires a grouping word to\r\n   cover its uses for temple, palace, and less exalted\r\n   buildings.]\r\n\r\n   [2266] The lower two storeys are not only backed by solid\r\n   ground but, except near the Hātī-pūl, have the rise of ground\r\n   in front of them which led Bābur to say they were \"even in a\r\n   pit\" (_chūqūr_).\r\n\r\n   [2267] MSS. vary between _har_ and _bīr_, every and one, in\r\n   this sentence. It may be right to read _bīr_, and apply it\r\n   only to the eastern façade as that on which there were most\r\n   cupolas. There are fewer on the south side, which still stands\r\n   (Luard's photo. No. 37).\r\n\r\n   [2268] The ground rises steeply from this Gate to an inner\r\n   one, called Hawā-pūl from the rush of air (_hawā_) through it.\r\n\r\n   [2269] Cunningham says the riders were the Rāja and a driver.\r\n   Perhaps they were a mahout and his mate. The statue stood to\r\n   the left on exit (_chīqīsh_).\r\n\r\n   [2270] This window will have been close to the Gate where no\r\n   mound interferes with outlook.\r\n\r\n   [2271] Rooms opening on inner and open courts appear to form\r\n   the third story of the residence.\r\n\r\n   [2272] T. _chūqūr_, hollow, pit. This storey is dark and\r\n   unventilated, a condition due to small windows, absence of\r\n   through draught, and the adjacent mound. Cunningham comments\r\n   on its disadvantages.\r\n\r\n   [2273] _Agarcha Hindūstānī takalluflār qīlīb tūrlār walī bī\r\n   hawālīk-rāq yīrlār dūr._ Perhaps amongst the pains taken were\r\n   those demanded for _punkhas_. I regret that Erskine's\r\n   translation of this passage, so superior to my own in literary\r\n   merit, does not suit the Turkī original. He worked from the\r\n   Persian translation, and not only so, but with a less rigid\r\n   rule of translation than binds me when working on Bābur's\r\n   _ipsissima verba_ (_Mems._ p. 384; Cunningham p. 349; Luard p.\r\n   226).\r\n\r\n   [2274] The words _aūrtā dā_ make apt contrast between the\r\n   outside position of Mān-sing's buildings which helped to form\r\n   the fort-wall, and Bikramājīt's which were further in except\r\n   perhaps one wall of his courtyard (see Cunningham's Plate\r\n   lxxxiii).\r\n\r\n   [2275] Cunningham (p. 350) says this was originally a\r\n   _bāra-dūrī_, a twelve-doored open hall, and must have been\r\n   light. His \"originally\" points to the view that the hall had\r\n   been altered before Bābur saw it but as it was only about 10\r\n   years old at that time, it was in its first form, presumably.\r\n   Perhaps Bābur saw it in a bad light. The dimensions Cunningham\r\n   gives of it suggest that the high dome must have been\r\n   frequently ill-lighted.\r\n\r\n   [2276] The word _tālār_, having various applications, is not\r\n   easy to match with a single English word, nor can one be sure\r\n   in all cases what it means, a platform, a hall, or _etc._ To\r\n   find an equivalent for its diminutive _tālār-ghina_ is still\r\n   more difficult. Raḥīm-dād's _tālār_-ette will have stood on\r\n   the flat centre of the dome, raised on four pillars or perhaps\r\n   with its roof only so-raised; one is sure there would be a\r\n   roof as protection against sun or moon. It may be noted that\r\n   the dome is not visible outside from below, but is hidden by\r\n   the continuation upwards of walls which form a mean-looking\r\n   parallelogram of masonry.\r\n\r\n   [2277] _T. tūr yūl._ Concerning this hidden road _see_\r\n   Cunningham p. 350 and Plate lxxxvii.\r\n\r\n   [2278] _bāghcha._ The context shews that the garden was for\r\n   flowers. For Bābur's distinctions between _bāghcha_, _bāgh_\r\n   and _baghāt_, _see_ Index _s.nn._\r\n\r\n   [2279] _shaft-ālū_ _i.e._ the rosy colour of peach-flowers,\r\n   perhaps lip-red (Steingass). Bābur's contrast seems to be\r\n   between those red oleanders of Hindūstān that are rosy-red,\r\n   and the deep red ones he found in Gūālīār.\r\n\r\n   [2280] _kul_, any large sheet of water, natural or artificial\r\n   (Bābur). This one will be the Sūraj-kund (Sun-tank).\r\n\r\n   [2281] This is the Telī Mandīr, or Telingana Mandīr (Luard).\r\n   Cf. Cunningham, p. 356 and Luard p. 227 for accounts of it;\r\n   and _G. of I._ _s.n._ Telīagarhi for Telī Rājas.\r\n\r\n   [2282] This is a large outwork reached from the Gate of the\r\n   same name. Bābur may have gone there specially to see the\r\n   Gūjarī Mandīr said by Cunningham to have been built by\r\n   Mān-sing's Gūjar wife Mṛiga-nayāna (fawn-eyed). Cf. Cunningham\r\n   p. 351 and, for other work done by the same Queen, in the s.\r\n   e. corner of the fort, p. 344; Luard p. 226. In this place\r\n   \"construction\" would serve to translate _`imārat_ (f. 340 n.).\r\n\r\n   [2283] _āb-duzd_, a word conveying the notion of a stealthy\r\n   taking of the water. The walls at the mouth of Urwā were built\r\n   by Altamsh for the protection of its water for the fort. The\r\n   date Bābur mentions (a few lines further) is presumably that\r\n   of their erection.\r\n\r\n   [2284] Cunningham, who gives 57 ft. as the height of this\r\n   statue, says Bābur estimated it at 20 _gaz_, or 40 ft., but\r\n   this is not so. Bābur's word is not _gaz_ a measure of 24\r\n   fingers-breadth, but _qārī_, the length from the tip of the\r\n   shoulder to the fingers-ends; it is about 33 inches, not less,\r\n   I understand. Thus stated in _qārīs_ Bābur's estimate of the\r\n   height comes very near Cunningham's, being a good 55 ft. to 57\r\n   ft. (I may note that I have usually translated _qārī_ by\r\n   \"yard\", as the yard is its nearest English equivalent. The\r\n   Pers. trs. of the B. N. translates by _gaz_, possibly a larger\r\n   _gaz_ than that of 24 fingers-breadth _i.e._ inches.)\r\n\r\n   [2285] The statues were not broken up by Bābur's agents; they\r\n   were mutilated; their heads were restored with coloured\r\n   plaster by the Jains (Cunningham p. 365; Luard p. 228).\r\n\r\n   [2286] _rozan_ [or, _aūz:n_] ... _tafarruj qīlīb_. Neither\r\n   Cunningham nor Luard mentions this window, perhaps because\r\n   Erskine does not; nor is this name of a Gate found. It might\r\n   be that of the Dhonda-paur (Cunningham, p. 339). The 1st Pers.\r\n   trs. [I.O. 215 f. 210] omits the word _rozan_ (or, _auz:n_);\r\n   the 2nd [I.O. 217 f. 236b] renders it by _jā'ī_, place.\r\n   Manifestly the Gate was opened by Bābur, but, presumably, not\r\n   precisely at the time of his visit. I am inclined to\r\n   understand that _rozan_ ... _tafarruj karda_ means enjoying\r\n   the window formerly used by Muḥammadan rulers. If _aūz:n_ be\r\n   the right reading, its sense is obscure.\r\n\r\n   [2287] This will have occurred in the latter half of 934 AH.\r\n   of which no record is now known.\r\n\r\n   [2288] He is mentioned under the name Asūk Mal _Rājpūt_, as a\r\n   servant of Rānā Sangā by the _Mirāt-i-sikandarī_, lith. ed. p.\r\n   161. In Bayley's Translation p. 273 he is called Awāsūk,\r\n   manifestly by clerical error, the sentence being _az\r\n   jānib-i-au Asūk Mal Rājpūt dar ān (qila`) būda_....\r\n\r\n   [2289] _ātā-līk, aūghūl-līk_, _i.e._ he spoke to the son as a\r\n   father, to the mother as a son.\r\n\r\n   [2290] The _Mirāt-i-sikandarī_ (lith. ed. p. 234, Bayley's\r\n   trs. p. 372) confirms Bābur's statement that the precious\r\n   things were at Bikramājīt's disposition. Perhaps they had been\r\n   in his mother's charge during her husband's life. They were\r\n   given later to Bahādur Shāh of Gujrāt.\r\n\r\n   [2291] The Telī Mandīr has not a cupola but a waggon-roof of\r\n   South Indian style, whence it may be that it has the southern\r\n   name Telingana, suggested by Col. Luard.\r\n\r\n   [2292] See Luard's Photo. No. 139 and P. Mundy's sketch of the\r\n   fort p. 62.\r\n\r\n   [2293] This will be the Ghargarāj-gate which looks south\r\n   though it is not at the south end of the fort-hill where there\r\n   is only a postern approached by a flight of stone steps\r\n   (Cunningham p. 332).\r\n\r\n   [2294] The garden will have been on the lower ground at the\r\n   foot of the ramp and not near the Hātī-pūl itself where the\r\n   scarp is precipitous.\r\n\r\n   [2295] _Mūndīn kīchīkrāq ātlānīlghān aīkāndūr._ This may imply\r\n   that the distance mentioned to Bābur was found by him an\r\n   over-estimate. Perhaps the fall was on the Mūrar-river.\r\n\r\n   [2296] Rope (Shaw); _corde qui sert à attacher le bagage sur\r\n   les chameaux_ (de Courteille); a thread of 20 cubits long for\r\n   weaving (Steingass); I have the impression that an _arghamchī_\r\n   is a horse's tether.\r\n\r\n   [2297] For information about this opponent of Bābur in the\r\n   battle of Kānwa, _see_ the _Asiatic Review_, Nov. 1915, II.\r\n   Beveridge's art. _Silhadī, and the Mirāt-i-sikandarī_.\r\n\r\n   [2298] Colonel Luard has suggested to us that the Bābur-nāma\r\n   word Sūkhjana may stand for Salwai or Sukhalhari, the names of\r\n   two villages near Gūālīār.\r\n\r\n   [2299] Presumably of night, 6-9 p.m., of Saturday Muḥ.\r\n   18th-Oct. 2nd.\r\n\r\n   [2300] f. 330_b_ and f. 339_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2301] Between the last explicit date in the text, _viz._\r\n   Sunday, Muḥ. 19th, and the one next following, _viz._\r\n   Saturday, Ṣafar 3rd, the diary of six days is wanting. The gap\r\n   seems to be between the unfinished account of doings in\r\n   Dhūlpūr and the incomplete one of those of the Monday of the\r\n   party. For one of the intermediate days Bābur had made an\r\n   appointment, when in Gūālīār (f. 343), with the envoys of\r\n   Bikramājīt, the trysting-day being Muḥ. 23rd (_i.e._ 9 days\r\n   after Muḥ. 14th). Bābur is likely to have gone to Bīāna as\r\n   planned; that envoys met him there may be surmised from the\r\n   circumstance that when negociations with Bikramājīt were\r\n   renewed in Āgra (f. 345), two sets of envoys were present, a\r\n   \"former\" one and a \"later\" one, and this although all envoys\r\n   had been dismissed from Gūālīār. The \"former\" ones will have\r\n   been those who went to Bīāna, were not given leave there, but\r\n   were brought on to Āgra; the \"later\" ones may have come to\r\n   Āgra direct from Ranthaṃbhor. It suits all round to take it\r\n   that pages have been lost on which was the record of the end\r\n   of the Dhūlpūr visit, of the journey to the, as yet unseen,\r\n   fort of Bīāna, of tryst kept by the envoys, of other doings in\r\n   Bīāna where, judging from the time taken to reach Sīkrī, it\r\n   may be that the _ma`jūn_ party was held.\r\n\r\n   [2302] Anglicé, Tuesday after 6 p.m.\r\n\r\n   [2303] _aghaz aīchīb nīma yīb_, which words seem to imply the\r\n   breaking of a fast.\r\n\r\n   [2304] Doubtless the garden owes its name to the eight heavens\r\n   or paradises mentioned in the Qurān (Hughes' _Dictionary of\r\n   Islām_ _s.n._ Paradise). Bābur appears to have reached Āgra on\r\n   the 1st of Ṣafar; the 2nd may well have been spent on the home\r\n   affairs of a returned traveller.\r\n\r\n   [2305] The great, or elder trio were daughters of Sl.\r\n   Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā, Bābur's paternal-aunts therefore, of his\r\n   dutiful attendance on whom, Gul-badan writes.\r\n\r\n   [2306] \"Lesser,\" _i.e._ younger in age, lower in rank as not\r\n   being the daughters of a sovereign Mīrzā, and held in less\r\n   honour because of a younger generation.\r\n\r\n   [2307] Gul-badan mentions the arrival in Hindūstān of a khānīm\r\n   of this name, who was a daughter of Sl. Maḥmūd Khān\r\n   _Chaghatāī_, Bābur's maternal-uncle; to this maternal\r\n   relationship the word _chīcha_ (mother) may refer. _Yīnkā_,\r\n   uncle's or elder brother's wife, has occurred before (ff. 192,\r\n   207), _chīcha_ not till now.\r\n\r\n   [2308] Cf. f. 344_b_ and n.5 concerning the surmised movements\r\n   of this set of envoys.\r\n\r\n   [2309] This promise was first proffered in Gūālīār (f.343).\r\n\r\n   [2310] These may be Bāī-qarā kinsfolk or Mīrān-shāhīs married\r\n   to them. No record of Shāh Qāsim's earlier mission is\r\n   preserved; presumably he was sent in 934 AH. and the record\r\n   will have been lost with much more of that year's. Khwānd-amīr\r\n   may well have had to do with this second mission, since he\r\n   could inform Bābur of the discomfort caused in Herī by the\r\n   near leaguer of `Ubaidu'l-lāh _Aūzbeg_.\r\n\r\n   [2311] _Albatta aūzūmīznī har nu` qīlīb tīgūrkūmīz dūr._ The\r\n   following versions of this sentence attest its\r\n   difficulty:—_Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_, 1st trs. I.O. 215 f. 212,\r\n   _albatta khūdrā ba har nū`ī ka bāshad dar ān khūb khẉāhīm\r\n   rasānad_; and 2nd trs. I.O. 217 f. 238_b_, _albatta dar har\r\n   nu` karda khūdrā mī rasānīm_; _Memoirs_ p. 388, \"I would make\r\n   an effort and return in person to Kābul\"; _Mémoires_ ii, 356,\r\n   _je ferais tous mes efforts pour pousser en avant_. I surmise,\r\n   as Pāyanda-i-ḥasan seems to have done (1st Pers. trs.\r\n   _supra_), that the passage alludes to Bābur's aims in\r\n   Hindūstān which he expects to touch in the coming spring. What\r\n   seems likely to be implied is what Erskine says and more,\r\n   _viz._ return to Kābul, renewal of conflict with the Aūzbeg\r\n   and release of Khurāsān kin through success. As is said by\r\n   Bābur immediately after this, T̤ahmāsp of Persia had defeated\r\n   `Ubaidu'l-lah _Aūzbeg_ before Bābur's letter was written.\r\n\r\n   [2312] _Sīmāb yīmāknī bunyād qīldīm_, a statement which would\r\n   be less abrupt if it followed a record of illness. Such a\r\n   record may have been made and lost.\r\n\r\n   [2313] The preliminaries to this now somewhat obscure section\r\n   will have been lost in the gap of 934 AH. They will have given\r\n   Bābur's instructions to Khwāja Dost-i-khāwand and have thrown\r\n   light on the unsatisfactory state of Kābul, concerning which a\r\n   good deal comes out later, particularly in Bābur's letter to\r\n   its Governor Khwāja Kalān. It may be right to suppose that\r\n   Kāmrān wanted Kābul and that he expected the Khwāja to bring\r\n   him an answer to his request for it, whether made by himself\r\n   or for him, through some-one, his mother perhaps, whom Bābur\r\n   now sent for to Hindūstān.\r\n\r\n   [2314] 934 AH.-August 26th 1528 AD.\r\n\r\n   [2315] The useful verb _tībrāmāk_ which connotes agitation of\r\n   mind with physical movement, will here indicate anxiety on the\r\n   Khwāja's part to fulfil his mission to Humāyūn.\r\n\r\n   [2316] Kāmrān's messenger seems to repeat his master's words,\r\n   using the courteous imperative of the 3rd person plural.\r\n\r\n   [2317] Though Bābur not infrequently writes of _e.g._ Bengalīs\r\n   and Aūzbegs and Turks in the singular, the Bengalī, the\r\n   Aūzbeg, the Turk, he seems here to mean `Ubaidu'l-lāh, the\r\n   then dominant Aūzbeg, although Kūchūm was Khāqān.\r\n\r\n   [2318] This muster preceded defeat near Jām of which Bābur\r\n   heard some 19 days later.\r\n\r\n   [2319] Humāyūn's wife was Bega Begīm, the later Ḥājī Begīm;\r\n   Kāmrān's bride was her cousin perhaps named Māh-afrūz\r\n   (Gul-badan's _Humāyūn-nāma_ f. 64_b_). The hear-say tense used\r\n   by the messenger allows the inference that he was not\r\n   accredited to give the news but merely repeated the rumour of\r\n   Kābul. The accredited bearer-of-good-tidings came later (f.\r\n   346_b_).\r\n\r\n   [2320] There are three enigmatic words in this section. The\r\n   first is the Sayyid's cognomen; was he _daknī_, rather dark of\r\n   hue, or _zaknī_, one who knows, or _ruknī_, one who props,\r\n   erects scaffolding, _etc._? The second mentions his\r\n   occupation; was he a _ghaiba-gar_, diviner (Erskine,\r\n   water-finder), a _jība-gar_, cuirass-maker, or a _jibā-gar_,\r\n   cistern-maker, which last suits with well-making? The third\r\n   describes the kind of well he had in hand, perhaps the stone\r\n   one of f. 353_b_; had it scaffolding, or was it for\r\n   drinking-water only (_khwāralīq_); had it an arch, or was it\r\n   chambered (_khwāzalīq_)? If Bābur's orders for the work had\r\n   been preserved,—they may be lost from f. 344_b_, trouble would\r\n   have been saved to scribes and translators, as an example of\r\n   whose uncertainty it may be mentioned that from the third word\r\n   (_khwāralīq_?) Erskine extracted \"jets d'eau and artificial\r\n   water-works\", and de Courteille \"_taillé dans le roc vif_\".\r\n\r\n   [2321] All Bābur's datings in Ṣafar are inconsistent with his\r\n   of Muḥarram, if a Muḥarram of 30 days [as given by Gladwin and\r\n   others].\r\n\r\n   [2322] _ḥarārat._ This Erskine renders by \"so violent an\r\n   illness\" (p. 388), de Courteille by \"_une inflammation\r\n   d'entrailles_\" (ii, 357), both swayed perhaps by the earlier\r\n   mention, on Muh. 10th, of Bābur's medicinal quick-silver, a\r\n   drug long in use in India for internal affections (Erskine).\r\n   Some such ailment may have been recorded and the record lost\r\n   (f. 345_b_ and n. 8), but the heat, fever, and trembling in\r\n   the illness of Ṣafar 23rd, taken with the reference to last's\r\n   year's attack of fever, all point to climatic fever.\r\n\r\n   [2323] _aīndīnī_ (or, _āndīnī_). Consistently with the\r\n   readings quoted in the preceding note, E. and de C. date the\r\n   onset of the fever as Sunday and translate _aīndīnī_ to mean\r\n   \"two days after\". It cannot be necessary however to specify\r\n   the interval between Friday and Sunday; the text is not\r\n   explicit; it seems safe to surmise only that the cold fit was\r\n   less severe on Sunday; the fever had ceased on the following\r\n   Thursday.\r\n\r\n   [2324] Anglicé, Monday after 6 p.m.\r\n\r\n   [2325] The _Rashaḥāt-i-´aīnu'l-ḥayāt_ (Tricklings from the\r\n   fountain of life) contains an interesting and almost\r\n   contemporary account of the Khwāja and of his\r\n   _Wālidiyyah-risāla_. A summary of what in it concerns the\r\n   Khwāja can be read in the JRAS. Jan. 1916, H. Beveridge's art.\r\n   The tract, so far as we have searched, is now known in\r\n   European literature only through Bābur's metrical translation\r\n   of it; and this, again, is known only through the _Rāmpūr\r\n   Dīwān_. [It may be noted here, though the topic belongs to the\r\n   beginning of the _Bābur-nāma_ (f. 2), that the _Rashaḥāt_\r\n   contains particulars about Aḥrārī's interventions for peace\r\n   between Bābur's father ´Umar Shaikh and those with whom he\r\n   quarrelled.]\r\n\r\n   [2326] \"Here unfortunately, Mr. Elphinstone's Turki copy\r\n   finally ends\" (Erskine), that is to say, the Elphinstone Codex\r\n   belonging to the Faculty of Advocates of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n   [2327] This work, Al-buṣīrī's famous poem in praise of the\r\n   Prophet, has its most recent notice in M. René Basset's\r\n   article of the _Encyclopædia of Islām_ (Leyden and London).\r\n\r\n   [2328] Bābur's technical terms to describe the metre he used\r\n   are, _ramal musaddas makhbūn ´arūẓ_ and _ẓarb gāh abtar gāh\r\n   makhbūn muhẕūf wazn_.\r\n\r\n   [2329] _aūtkān yīl (u) har maḥal mūndāq ´āriẓat kīm būldī_,\r\n   from which it seems correct to omit the _u_ (and), thus\r\n   allowing the reference to be to last year's illnesses only;\r\n   because no record, of any date, survives of illness lasting\r\n   even one full month, and no other year has a _lacuna_ of\r\n   sufficient length unless one goes improbably far back: for\r\n   these attacks seem to be of Indian climatic fever. One in last\r\n   year (934 AH.) lasting 25-26 days (f. 331) might be called a\r\n   month's illness; another or others may have happened in the\r\n   second half of the year and their record be lost, as several\r\n   have been lost, to the detriment of connected narrative.\r\n\r\n   [2330] Mr. Erskine's rendering (_Memoirs_ p. 388) of the above\r\n   section shows something of what is gained by acquaintance\r\n   which he had not, with the _Rashaḥāt-i-´āinu'l-ḥayāt_ and with\r\n   Bābur's versified _Wālidiyyah-risāla_.\r\n\r\n   [2331] This gap, like some others in the diary of 935 AH. can\r\n   be attributed safely to loss of pages, because preliminaries\r\n   are now wanting to several matters which Bābur records shortly\r\n   after it. Such are (1) the specification of the three articles\r\n   sent to Naṣrat Shāh, (2) the motive for the feast of f.\r\n   351_b_, (3) the announcement of the approach of the surprising\r\n   group of envoys, who appear without introduction at that\r\n   entertainment, in a manner opposed to Bābur's custom of\r\n   writing, (4) an account of their arrival and reception.\r\n\r\n   [2332] Land-holder (_see_ _Hobson-Jobson_ _s.n._ talookdar).\r\n\r\n   [2333] The long detention of this messenger is mentioned in\r\n   Bābur's letter to Humāyūn (f. 349).\r\n\r\n   [2334] These words, if short _a_ be read in Shăh, make 934 by\r\n   _abjad_. The child died in infancy; no son of Humāyūn's had\r\n   survived childhood before Akbar was born, some 14 years later.\r\n   Concerning Abū'l-wajd _Fārighī_, _see_ _Ḥabību's-siyar_, lith.\r\n   ed. ii, 347; _Muntakhabu't-tawārikh_, Bib. Ind. ed. i, 3; and\r\n   Index _s.n._\r\n\r\n   [2335] I am indebted to Mr. A. E. Hinks, Secretary of the\r\n   Royal Geographical Society, for the following approximate\r\n   estimate of the distances travelled by Bīān Shaikh:—(_a_) From\r\n   Kishm to Kābul 240m.—from Kābul to Peshāwar 175m.—from\r\n   Peshāwar to Āgra (railroad distance) 759 m.—total 1174 m.;\r\n   daily average _cir._ 38 miles; (_b_) Qila`-i-ẕafar to Kābul\r\n   264m.—Kābul to Qandahār 316m.—total 580m.; daily average\r\n   _cir._ 53 miles. The second journey was made probably in 913\r\n   AH. and to inform Bābur of the death of the Shāh of Badakhshān\r\n   (f. 213_b_).\r\n\r\n   [2336] On Muḥ. 10th 934 AH.-Sep. 26th 1528 AD. For accounts of\r\n   the campaign _see_ Rieu's Suppl. Persian Cat. under _Histories\r\n   of T̤ahmāsp_ (Churchill Collection); the _Ḥabību's-siyar_ and\r\n   the _`Ālam-ārāī-`abbāsī_, the last a highly rhetorical work,\r\n   Bābur's accounts (Index _s.n._ Jām) are merely repetitions of\r\n   news given to him; he is not responsible for mistakes he\r\n   records, such as those of f. 354. It must be mentioned that\r\n   Mr. Erskine has gone wrong in his description of the battle,\r\n   the starting-point of error being his reversal of two events,\r\n   the encampment of T̤ahmāsp at Rādagān and his passage through\r\n   Mashhad. A century ago less help, through maps and travel, was\r\n   available than now.\r\n\r\n   [2337] _tufak u arāba_, the method of array Bābur adopted from\r\n   the Rūmī-Persian model.\r\n\r\n   [2338] T̤ahmāsp's main objective, aimed at earlier than the\r\n   Aūzbeg muster in Merv, was Herāt, near which `Ubaid Khān had\r\n   been for 7 months. He did not take the shortest route for\r\n   Mashhad, _viz._ the Dāmghān-Sabzawār-Nīshāpūr road, but went\r\n   from Dāmghān for Mashhad by way of Kālpūsh (_`Ālam-ārāī_ lith.\r\n   ed. p. 45) and Rādagān. Two military advantages are obvious on\r\n   this route; (1) it approaches Mashhad by the descending road\r\n   of the Kechef-valley, thus avoiding the climb into that valley\r\n   by a pass beyond Nīshāpūr on the alternative route; and (2) it\r\n   passes through the fertile lands of Rādagān. [For Kālpūsh and\r\n   the route _see_ Fr. military map, Sheets Astarābād and Merv,\r\n   n.e. of Basṯām.]\r\n\r\n   [2339] 7 m. from Kushan and 86 m. from Mashhad. As Lord Curzon\r\n   reports (_Persia_, ii, 120) that his interlocutors on the spot\r\n   were not able to explain the word \"Radkan,\" it may be useful\r\n   to note here that the town seems to borrow its name from the\r\n   ancient tower standing near it, the _Mīl-i-rādagān_, or, as\r\n   Réclus gives it, _Tour de méimandan_, both names meaning,\r\n   Tower of the bounteous (or, beneficent, highly-distinguished,\r\n   _etc._). (Cf. Vullers Dict. _s.n._ _rād_; Réclus' _L'Asie\r\n   Antérieure_ p. 219; and O'Donovan's _Merv Oasis_.) Perhaps\r\n   light on the distinguished people (_rādagān_) is given by the\r\n   _Dābistān's_ notice of an ancient sect, the Rādīyān, seeming\r\n   to be fire-worshippers whose chief was Rād-gūna, an eminently\r\n   brave hero of the latter part of Jāmshīd's reign (800 B.C.?).\r\n   Of the town Rādagān Daulat Shāh makes frequent mention. A\r\n   second town so-called and having a tower lies north of\r\n   Ispahān.\r\n\r\n   [2340] In these days of trench-warfare it would give a wrong\r\n   impression to say that T̤ahmāsp entrenched himself; he did\r\n   what Bābur did before his battles at Panīpat and Kānwa\r\n   (_q.v._).\r\n\r\n   [2341] The Aūzbegs will have omitted from their purview of\r\n   affairs that T̤ahmāsp's men were veterans.\r\n\r\n   [2342] The holy city had been captured by `Ubaid Khān in 933\r\n   AH. (1525 AD.), but nothing in Bīān Shaikh's narrative\r\n   indicates that they were now there in force.\r\n\r\n   [2343] Presumably the one in the Rādagān-meadow.\r\n\r\n   [2344] using the _yada-tāsh_ to ensure victory (Index _s.n._).\r\n\r\n   [2345] If then, as now, Scorpio's appearance were expected in\r\n   Oct.-Nov., the Aūzbegs had greatly over-estimated their power\r\n   to check T̤ahmāsp's movements; but it seems fairly clear that\r\n   they expected Scorpio to follow Virgo in Sept.-Oct. according\r\n   to the ancient view of the Zodiacal Signs which allotted two\r\n   houses to the large Scorpio and, if it admitted Libra at all,\r\n   placed it between Scorpio's claws (Virgil's _Georgics_ i, 32\r\n   and Ovid's _Metamorphoses_, ii, 195.—H. B.).\r\n\r\n   [2346] It would appear that the Aūzbegs, after hearing that\r\n   T̤ahmāsp was encamped at Rādagān, expected to interpose\r\n   themselves in his way at Mashhad and to get their 20,000 to\r\n   Rādagān before he broke camp. T̤āhmāsp's swiftness spoiled\r\n   their plan; he will have stayed at Rādagān a short time only,\r\n   perhaps till he had further news of the Aūzbegs, perhaps also\r\n   for commissariat purposes and to rest his force. He visited\r\n   the shrine of Imām Reza, and had reached Jām in time to\r\n   confront his adversaries as they came down to it from\r\n   Zawarābād (Pilgrims'-town).\r\n\r\n   [2347] or, Khirjard, as many MSS. have it. It seems to be a\r\n   hamlet or suburb of Jām. The _`Ālam-ārāī_ (lith. ed. p. 40)\r\n   writes Khusrau-jard-i-Jām (the Khusrau-throne of Jām), perhaps\r\n   rhetorically. The hamlet is Maulānā `Abdu'r-raḥmān _Jāmī's_\r\n   birthplace (Daulat Shāh's _Taẕkirat_, E. G. Browne's ed. p.\r\n   483). Jām now appears on maps as Turbat-i-Shaikh Jāmī, the\r\n   tomb (_turbat_) being that of the saintly ancestor of Akbar's\r\n   mother Ḥamīda-bānū.\r\n\r\n   [2348] The _`Ālam-ārāī_ (lith. ed. p. 31) says, but in\r\n   grandiose language, that `Ubaid Khān placed at the foot of his\r\n   standard 40 of the most eminent men of Transoxania who prayed\r\n   for his success, but that as his cause was not good, their\r\n   supplications were turned backwards, and that all were slain\r\n   where they had prayed.\r\n\r\n   [2349] Here the 1st Pers. trs. (I.O. 215 f. 214) mentions that\r\n   it was Chalma who wrote and despatched the exact particulars\r\n   of the defeat of the Aūzbegs. This information explains the\r\n   presumption Bābur expresses. It shows that Chalma was in Ḥiṣār\r\n   where he may have written his letter to give news to Humāyūn.\r\n   At the time Bīān Shaikh left, the Mīrzā was near Kishm; if he\r\n   had been the enterprising man he was not, one would surmise\r\n   that he had moved to seize the chance of the sulṯāns'\r\n   abandonment of Ḥiṣār, without waiting for his father's urgency\r\n   (f. 348_b_). Whether he had done so and was the cause of the\r\n   sulṯāns' flight, is not known from any chronicle yet come to\r\n   our hands. Chalma's father Ibrāhīm _Jānī_ died fighting for\r\n   Bābur against Shaibāq Khān in 906 AH. (f. 90_b_).\r\n\r\n   As the sense of the name-of-office Chalma is still in doubt, I\r\n   suggest that it may be an equivalent of _aftābachī_, bearer of\r\n   the water-bottle on journeys. _T. chalma_ can mean a\r\n   water-vessel carried on the saddle-bow; one Chalma on record\r\n   was a _safarchī_; if, in this word, _safar_ be read to mean\r\n   journey, an approach is made to _aftābachī_ (fol. 15_b_ and\r\n   note; Blochmann's A.-i-A. p. 378 and n. 3).\r\n\r\n   [2350] The copies of Bābur's Turkī letter to Humāyūn and the\r\n   later one to Khwāja Kalān (f. 359) are in some MSS. of the\r\n   Persian text translated only (I.O. 215 f. 214); in others\r\n   appear in Turkī only (I.O. 217 f. 240); in others appear in\r\n   Turkī and Persian (B. M. Add. 26,000 and I.O. 2989); while in\r\n   Muḥ. Shīrāzī's lith. ed. they are omitted altogether (p. 228).\r\n\r\n   [2351] Trans- and Cis-Hindukush. Pāyanda-ḥasan (in one of his\r\n   useful glosses to the 1st Pers. trs.) amplifies here by\r\n   \"Khurāsān, Mā warā'u'n-nahr and Kābul\".\r\n\r\n   [2352] The words Bābur gives as mispronunciations are somewhat\r\n   uncertain in sense; manifestly both are of ill-omen:—Al-amān\r\n   itself [of which the _alāmā_ of the Ḥai. MS. and Ilminsky\r\n   maybe an abbreviation,] is the cry of the vanquished,\r\n   \"Quarter! mercy!\"; _Aīlāmān_ and also _ālāman_ can represent a\r\n   Turkmān raider.\r\n\r\n   [2353] Presumably amongst Tīmūrids.\r\n\r\n   [2354] Perhaps Bābur here makes a placatory little joke.\r\n\r\n   [2355] _i.e._ that offered by T̤ahmāsp's rout of the Aūzbegs\r\n   at Jām.\r\n\r\n   [2356] He was an adherent of Bābur. Cf. f. 353.\r\n\r\n   [2357] The plural \"your\" will include Humāyūn and Kāmrān.\r\n   Neither had yet shewn himself the heritor of his father's\r\n   personal dash and valour; they had lacked the stress which\r\n   shaped his heroism.\r\n\r\n   [2358] My husband has traced these lines to Niẕāmī's _Khusrau_\r\n   and _Shīrīn_. [They occur on f. 256_b_ in his MS. of 317\r\n   folios.] Bābur may have quoted from memory, since his version\r\n   varies. The lines need their context to be understood; they\r\n   are part of Shīrīn's address to Khusrau when she refuses to\r\n   marry him because at the time he is fighting for his sovereign\r\n   position; and they say, in effect, that while all other work\r\n   stops for marriage (_kadkhudāī_), kingly rule does not.\r\n\r\n   [2359] _Aūlūghlār kūtārīmlīk kīrāk_; 2nd Pers. trs. _buzurgān\r\n   bardāsht mī bāīd kardand_. This dictum may be a quotation. I\r\n   have translated it to agree with Bābur's reference to the ages\r\n   of the brothers, but _aūlūghlār_ expresses greatness of\r\n   position as well as seniority in age, and the dictum may be\r\n   taken as a Turkī version of \"_Noblesse oblige_\", and may also\r\n   mean \"The great must be magnanimous\". (Cf. de C.'s Dict.\r\n   _s.n._ _kūtārīmlīk_.) [It may be said of the verb _bardāshlan_\r\n   used in the Pers. trs., that Abū'l-faẓl, perhaps translating\r\n   _kūtārīmlīk_ reported to him, puts it into Bābur's mouth when,\r\n   after praying to take Humāyūn's illness upon himself, he cried\r\n   with conviction, \"I have borne it away\" (A.N. trs. H.B. i,\r\n   276).]\r\n\r\n   [2360] If Bābur had foreseen that his hard-won rule in\r\n   Hindūstān was to be given to the winds of one son's\r\n   frivolities and the other's disloyalty, his words of scant\r\n   content with what the Hindūstān of his desires had brought\r\n   him, would have expressed a yet keener pain (_Rāmpūr Dīwān_\r\n   E.D.R.'s ed. p. 15 l. 5 fr. ft.).\r\n\r\n   [2361] _Bostān_, cap. _Advice of Noshirwān to Hurmuz_ (H.B.).\r\n\r\n   [2362] A little joke at the expense of the mystifying letter.\r\n\r\n   [2363] For _yā_, Mr. Erskine writes _be_. What the mistake was\r\n   is an open question; I have guessed an exchange of _ī_ for\r\n   _ū_, because such an exchange is not infrequent amongst Turkī\r\n   long vowels.\r\n\r\n   [2364] That of reconquering Tīmūrid lands.\r\n\r\n   [2365] of _Kūlāb_; he was the father of Ḥaram Begīm, one of\r\n   Gul-badan's personages.\r\n\r\n   [2366] _aūn altī gūnlūk m:ljār bīla_, as on f. 354_b_, and\r\n   with exchange of T. _m:ljār_ for P. _mī`ād_, f. 355_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2367] Probably into Rājpūt lands, notably into those of\r\n   Ṣalāḥu'd-dīn.\r\n\r\n   [2368] _tukhmalīq chakmānlār_; as _tukhma_ means both button\r\n   and gold-embroidery, it may be right, especially of Hindūstān\r\n   articles, to translate sometimes in the second sense.\r\n\r\n   [2369] These statements of date are consistent with Bābur's\r\n   earlier explicit entries and with Erskine's equivalents of the\r\n   Christian Era, but at variance with Gladwin's and with\r\n   Wüstenfeldt's calculation that Rabī` II. 1st was Dec. 13th.\r\n   Yet Gladwin (_Revenue Accounts_, ed. 1790 AD. p. 22) gives\r\n   Rabī` I. 30 days. Without in the smallest degree questioning\r\n   the two European calculations, I follow Bābur, because in his\r\n   day there may have been allowed variation which finds no entry\r\n   in methodical calendars. Erskine followed Bābur's statements;\r\n   he is likely nevertheless to have seen Gladwin's book.\r\n\r\n   [2370] Erskine estimated this at £500, but later cast doubts\r\n   on such estimates as being too low (_History of India_, vol.\r\n   i, App. D.).\r\n\r\n   [2371] The bearer of the stamp (_ṯamghā_) who by impressing it\r\n   gave quittance for the payment of tolls and other dues.\r\n\r\n   [2372] Either 24ft. or 36ft. according to whether the short or\r\n   long _qārī_ be meant (_infra_). These towers would provide\r\n   resting-place, and some protection against ill-doers. They\r\n   recall the two _mīl-i-rādagān_ of Persia (f. 347 _n._ 9), the\r\n   purpose of which is uncertain. Bābur's towers were not \"_kos\r\n   mīnārs_\", nor is it said that he ordered each _kuroh_ to be\r\n   marked on the road. Some of the _kos mīnārs_ on the \"old\r\n   Mughal roads\" were over 30ft. high; a considerable number are\r\n   entered and depicted in the _Annual Progress Report_ of the\r\n   Archæological Survey for 1914 (Northern Circle, p. 45 and\r\n   Plates 44, 45). Some at least have a _lower_ chamber.\r\n\r\n   [2373] Four-doored, open-on-all-sides. We have not found the\r\n   word with this meaning in Dictionaries. It may translate H.\r\n   _chaukandī_.\r\n\r\n   [2374] Erskine makes 9 _kos_ (_kurohs_) to be 13-14 miles,\r\n   perhaps on the basis of the smaller _gaz_ of 24 inches.\r\n\r\n   [2375] _altī yām-ātī bāghlāghāīlār_ which, says one of\r\n   Erskine's manuscripts, is called a _dāk-choki_.\r\n\r\n   [2376] Neither Erskine (_Mems._ p. 394), nor de Courteille\r\n   (_Méms._ ii, 370) recognized the word _Mubīn_ here, although\r\n   each mentions the poem later (p. 431 and ii, 461), deriving\r\n   his information about it from the _Akbar-nāma_, Erskine\r\n   direct, de Courteille by way of the Turkī translation of the\r\n   same _Akbar-nāma_ passage, which Ilminsky found in Kehr's\r\n   volume and which is one of the much discussed \"Fragments\", at\r\n   first taken to be extra writings of Bābur's (cf. Index _in\r\n   loco_ _s.n._ Fragments). Ilminsky (p. 455) prints the word\r\n   clearly, as one who knows it; he may have seen that part of\r\n   the poem itself which is included in Berésine's _Chrestomathie\r\n   Turque_ (p. 226 to p. 272), under the title _Fragment d'un\r\n   poème inconnu de Bābour_, and have observed that Bābur himself\r\n   shews his title to be _Mubīn_, in the lines of his colophon\r\n   (p. 271),\r\n\r\n     _Chū bīān qīldīm āndā shar`īyāt,\r\n     Nī `ajab gar Mubīn dīdīm āt?_\r\n\r\n   (Since in it I have made exposition of Laws, what wonder if I\r\n   named it _Mubīn_ (exposition)?) Cf. _Translator's Note_, p.\r\n   437. [Berésine says (Ch. T.) that he prints half of his\r\n   \"_unique manuscrit_\" of the poem.]\r\n\r\n   [2377] The passage Bābur quotes comes from the _Mubīn_ section\r\n   on _tayammum masā'la_ (purification with sand), where he tells\r\n   his son sand may be used, _Sū yurāq būlsā sīndīn aīr bīr mīl_\r\n   (if from thee water be one _mīl_ distant), and then interjects\r\n   the above explanation of what the _mīl_ is. Two lines of his\r\n   original are not with the _Bābur-nāma_.\r\n\r\n   [2378] The _ṯanāb_ was thus 120 ft. long. Cf. A.-i-A. Jarrett\r\n   i, 414; Wilson's _Glossary of Indian Terms_ and Gladwin's\r\n   _Revenue Accounts_, p. 14.\r\n\r\n   [2379] Bābur's customary method of writing allows the\r\n   inference that he recorded, in due place, the coming and\r\n   reception of the somewhat surprising group of guests now\r\n   mentioned as at this entertainment. That preliminary record\r\n   will have been lost in one or more of the small gaps in his\r\n   diary of 935 AH. The envoys from the Samarkand Aūzbegs and\r\n   from the Persian Court may have come in acknowledgment of the\r\n   _Fātḥ-nāma_ which announced victory over Rānā Sangā; the\r\n   guests from Farghāna will have accepted the invitation sent,\r\n   says Gul-badan, \"in all directions,\" after Bābur's defeat of\r\n   Sl. Ibrāhīm _Lūdī_, to urge hereditary servants and Tīmūrid\r\n   and Chīngīz-khānid kinsfolk to come and see prosperity with\r\n   him now when \"the Most High has bestowed sovereignty\" (f.\r\n   293a; Gul-badan's H.N. f. 11).\r\n\r\n   [2380] Hindū here will represent Rājpūt. D'Herbélot's\r\n   explanation of the name Qīzīl-bāsh (Red-head) comes in\r\n   usefully here:—\"KEZEL BASCH or KIZIL BASCH. Mot Turc qui\r\n   signifie _Tête rouge_. Les Turcs appellent les Persans de ce\r\n   nom, depuis qu'Ismaël Sofi, fondateur de la Dynastie des\r\n   princes qui regnent aujourd'hui en Perse, commanda à ses\r\n   soldats de porter un bonnet rouge autour duquel il y a une\r\n   écharpe ou Turban à douze plis, en mémoire et à l'honneur des\r\n   12 Imams, successeurs d'Ali, desquels il prétendoit descendre.\r\n   Ce bonnet s'appelle en Persan, _Tāj_, et fut institué l'an\r\n   907^e de l'Hég.\" T̤ahmāsp himself uses the name Qīzīl-bāsh;\r\n   Bābur does so too. Other explanations of it are found\r\n   (Steingass), but the one quoted above suits its use without\r\n   contempt. (Cf. f. 354 n. 3).\r\n\r\n   [2381] _cir._ 140-150ft. or more if the 36in. _qārī_ be the\r\n   unit.\r\n\r\n   [2382] _Andropogon muricatus_, the scented grass of which the\r\n   roots are fitted into window spaces and moistened to mitigate\r\n   dry, hot winds. Cf. _Hobson-Jobson_ _s.n._ _Cuscuss_.\r\n\r\n   [2383] A nephew and a grandson of Aḥrāri's second son Yahya\r\n   (f. 347_b_) who had stood staunch to Bābur till murdered in\r\n   906 AH.-1500 AD. (80_b_). They are likely to be those to whom\r\n   went a copy of the _Mubīn_ under cover of a letter addressed\r\n   to lawyers of Mā warā'u'n-nahr (f. 351 n. 1). The Khwājas were\r\n   in Āgra three weeks after Bābur finished his metrical version\r\n   of their ancestor's _Wālidiyyah-risāla_; whether their coming\r\n   (which must have been announced some time before their\r\n   arrival), had part in directing his attention to the tract can\r\n   only be surmised (f. 346).\r\n\r\n   [2384] He was an Aūzbeg (f. 371) and from his association here\r\n   with a Bāī-qarā, and, later with Qāsim-i-ḥusain who was half\r\n   Bāī-qarā, half Aūzbeg, seems likely to be of the latter's\r\n   family (Index _s.nn._).\r\n\r\n   [2385] _sāchāq kīūrdī_ (_kīltūrdī_?) No record survives to\r\n   tell the motive for this feast; perhaps the gifts made to\r\n   Bābur were congratulatory on the birth of a grandson, the\r\n   marriage of a son, and on the generally-prosperous state of\r\n   his affairs.\r\n\r\n   [2386] Gold, silver and copper coins.\r\n\r\n   [2387] Made so by _bhang_ or other exciting drug.\r\n\r\n   [2388] _ārāl_, presumably one left by the winter-fall of the\r\n   Jumna; or, a peninsula.\r\n\r\n   [2389] Scribes and translators have been puzzled here. My\r\n   guess at the Turkī clause is _aūrang aīralīk kīsh jabbah_. In\r\n   reading _muslin_, I follow Erskine who worked in India and\r\n   could take local opinion; moreover gifts made in Āgra probably\r\n   would be Indian.\r\n\r\n   [2390] For one Ḥāfiẕ of Samarkand see f.237_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2391] Kūchūm was Khāqān of the Aūzbegs and had his seat in\r\n   Samarkand. One of his sons, Abū-sa`īd, mentioned below, had\r\n   sent envoys. With Abū-sa`īd is named Mihr-bān who was one of\r\n   Kūchūm's wives; Pulād was their son. Mihr-bān was, I think, a\r\n   half-sister of Bābur, a daughter of `Umar Shaikh and Umīd of\r\n   Andijān (f. 9), and a full-sister of Nāṣir. No doubt she had\r\n   been captured on one of the occasions when Bābur lost to the\r\n   Aūzbegs. In 925 AH.-1519 AD. (f. 237_b_) when he sent his\r\n   earlier _Dīwān_ to Pulād Sl. (_Translator's Note_, p. 438) he\r\n   wrote a verse on its back which looks to be addressed to his\r\n   half-sister through her son.\r\n\r\n   [2392] T̤ahmāsp's envoy; the title Chalabī shews high birth.\r\n\r\n   [2393] This statement seems to imply that the weight made of\r\n   silver and the weight made of gold were of the same size and\r\n   that the differing specific gravity of the two metals,—that of\r\n   silver being _cir._ 10 and that of gold _cir._ 20—gave their\r\n   equivalents the proportion Bābur states. Persian Dictionaries\r\n   give _sang_ (_tāsh_), a weight, but without further\r\n   information. We have not found mention of the _tāsh_ as a\r\n   recognized Turkī weight; perhaps the word _tāsh_ stands for an\r\n   ingot of unworked metal of standard size. (Cf. _inter alios\r\n   libros_, A.-i-A. Blochmann p. 36, Codrington's _Musalman\r\n   Numismatics_ p. 117, concerning the _miṣqāl, dīnār, etc._)\r\n\r\n   [2394] _tarkāsh bīla._ These words are clear in the Ḥai. MS.\r\n   but uncertain in some others. E. and de C. have no equivalent\r\n   of them. Perhaps the coins were given by the quiverful; that a\r\n   quiver of arrows was given is not expressed.\r\n\r\n   [2395] Bābur's half-nephew; he seems from his name\r\n   Keepsake-of-nāṣir to have been posthumous.\r\n\r\n   [2396] 934 AH.-1528 AD. (f. 336).\r\n\r\n   [2397] Or, gold-embroidered.\r\n\r\n   [2398] Wife of Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā.\r\n\r\n   [2399] These Highlanders of Asfara will have come by\r\n   invitation sent after the victory at Panīpat; their welcome\r\n   shows remembrance of and gratitude for kindness received a\r\n   quarter of a century earlier. Perhaps villagers from Dikh-kat\r\n   will have come too, who had seen the Pādshāh run barefoot on\r\n   their hills (_Index s.nn._).\r\n\r\n   [2400] Here gratitude is shewn for protection given in 910\r\n   AH.-1504 AD. to the families of Bābur and his men when on the\r\n   way to Kābul. Qurbān and Shaikhī were perhaps in Fort Ajar (f.\r\n   122_b_, f. 126).\r\n\r\n   [2401] Perhaps these acrobats were gipsies.\r\n\r\n   [2402] This may be the one with which Sayyid Daknī was\r\n   concerned (f. 346).\r\n\r\n   [2403] Bābur obviously made the distinction between _pahr_ and\r\n   _pās_ that he uses the first for day-watches, the second for\r\n   those of the night.\r\n\r\n   [2404] Anglicé, Tuesday, Dec. 21st; by Muḥammadan plan,\r\n   Wednesday 22nd. Dhūlpūr is 34 m. s. of Āgra; the journey of\r\n   10hrs. 20m. would include the nooning and the time taken in\r\n   crossing rivers.\r\n\r\n   [2405] The well was to fill a cistern; the 26 spouts with\r\n   their 26 supports were to take water into (26?) conduits.\r\n   Perhaps _tāsh_ means that they were hewn in the solid rock;\r\n   perhaps that they were on the outer side of the reservoir.\r\n   They will not have been built of hewn stone, or the word would\r\n   have been _sangīn_ or _tāshdīn_.\r\n\r\n   [2406] One occupation of these now blank days is indicated by\r\n   the date of the \"_Rāmpūr Dīwān_\", Thursday Rabī` II. 15th\r\n   (Dec. 27th).\r\n\r\n   [2407] The demon (or, athlete) sulṯān of Rumelia (_Rūmlū_);\r\n   once T̤ahmāsp's guardian (_Taẕkirat-i-T̤ahmāsp_, Bib. Ind. ed.\r\n   Phillott, p. 2). Some writers say he was put to death by\r\n   T̤ahmāsp (_æt._ 12) in 933 AH.; if this were so, it is strange\r\n   to find a servant described as his in 935 AH. (An account of\r\n   the battle is given in the _Sharaf-nāma_, written in 1005 AH.\r\n   by Sharaf Khān who was reared in T̤ahmāsp's house. The book\r\n   has been edited by Veliaminof-Zernof and translated into\r\n   French by Charmoy; cf. Trs. vol. ii, part i, p. 555.—_H.\r\n   Beveridge._)\r\n\r\n   [2408] This name, used by one who was with the Shāh's troops,\r\n   attracts attention; it may show the composition of the Persian\r\n   army; it may differentiate between the troops and their\r\n   \"Qīzīl-bāsh leader\".\r\n\r\n   [2409] Several writers give Sārū-qamsh (Charmoy, _roseau\r\n   jaune_) as the name of the village where the battle was\r\n   fought; Sharaf Khān gives `Umarābād and mentions that after\r\n   the fight T̤ahmāsp spent some time in the meadow of\r\n   Sārū-qamsh.\r\n\r\n   [2410] The number of T̤ahmāsp's guns being a matter of\r\n   interest, reference should be made to Bābur's accounts of his\r\n   own battles in which he arrayed in Rūmī (Ottoman) fashion; it\r\n   will then be seen that the number of carts does not imply the\r\n   number of guns (Index _s.n._ _arāba_, cart).\r\n\r\n   [2411] This cannot but represent T̤ahmāsp who was on the\r\n   battle-field (_see_ his own story _infra_). He was 14 years\r\n   old; perhaps he was called Shāh-zāda, and not Shāh, on account\r\n   of his youth, or because under guardianship (?). Readers of\r\n   the Persian histories of his reign may know the reason. Bābur\r\n   hitherto has always called the boy Shāh-zāda; after the\r\n   victory at Jām, he styles him Shāh. Jūha Sl. (_Taklū_) who was\r\n   with him on the field, was Governor of Ispahān.\r\n\r\n   [2412] If this Persian account of the battle be in its right\r\n   place in Bābur's diary, it is singular that the narrator\r\n   should be so ill-informed at a date allowing facts to be\r\n   known; the three sulṯāns he names as killed escaped to die,\r\n   Kūchūm in 937 AH.-1530 AD., Abū-sa`īd in 940 AH.-1533 AD.,\r\n   `Ubaid in 946 AH.-1539 AD. (Lane-Poole's _Muḥammadan\r\n   Dynasties_). It would be natural for Bābur to comment on the\r\n   mistake, since envoys from two of the sulṯāns reported killed,\r\n   were in Āgra. There had been time for the facts to be known:\r\n   the battle was fought on Sep. 26th; the news of it was in Āgra\r\n   on Nov. 23rd; envoys from both adversaries were at Bābur's\r\n   entertainment on Dec. 19th. From this absence of comment and\r\n   for the reasons indicated in note 3 (_infra_), it appears that\r\n   matter has been lost from the text.\r\n\r\n   [2413] T̤ahmāsp's account of the battle is as follows\r\n   (_T.-i-T̤._ p. 11):—\"I marched against the Aūzbegs. The battle\r\n   took place outside Jām. At the first onset, Aūzbeg prevailed\r\n   over Qīzīl-bāsh. Ya`qūb Sl. fled and Sl. Wālāma _Taklū_ and\r\n   other officers of the right wing were defeated and put to\r\n   flight. Putting my trust in God, I prayed and advanced some\r\n   paces.... One of my body-guard getting up with `Ubaid struck\r\n   him with a sword, passed on, and occupied himself with\r\n   another. Qūlīj Bahādur and other Aūzbegs carried off the\r\n   wounded `Ubaid; Kūchkūnjī (Kūchūm) Khān and Jānī Khān Beg,\r\n   when they became aware of this state of affairs, fled to Merv.\r\n   Men who had fled from our army rejoined us that day. That\r\n   night I spent on the barren plain (_ṣaḥra'_). I did not know\r\n   what had happened to `Ubaid. I thought perhaps they were\r\n   devising some stratagem against me.\" The `A.-`A. says that\r\n   `Ubaid's assailant, on seeing his low stature and contemptible\r\n   appearance, left him for a more worthy foe.\r\n\r\n   [2414] Not only does some comment from Bābur seem needed on an\r\n   account of deaths he knew had not occurred, but loss of matter\r\n   may be traced by working backward from his next explicit date\r\n   (_Friday 19th_), to do which shows fairly well that the \"same\r\n   day\" will be not Tuesday the 16th but Thursday the 18th.\r\n   Ghīāṣu'd-dīn's reception was on the day preceding Friday 19th,\r\n   so that part of Thursday's record (as shewn by \"on this same\r\n   day\"), the whole of Wednesday's, and (to suit an expected\r\n   comment by Bābur on the discrepant story of the Aūzbeg deaths)\r\n   part of Tuesday's are missing. The gap may well have contained\r\n   mention of Ḥasan _Chalabī's_ coming (f. 357), or explain why\r\n   he had not been at the feast with his younger brother.\r\n\r\n   [2415] _qūrchī_, perhaps body-guard, life-guardsman.\r\n\r\n   [2416] As on f. 350_b_ (_q.v._ p. 628 n. 1) _aūn altī gūnlūk\r\n   bŭljār_ (or, _m:ljār_) _bīla_.\r\n\r\n   [2417] A sub-division of the Ballia district of the United\r\n   Provinces, on the right bank of the Ghogrā.\r\n\r\n   [2418] _i.e._ in 16 days; he was 24 or 25 days away.\r\n\r\n   [2419] The envoy had been long in returning; Kanwā was fought\r\n   in March, 1527; it is now the end of 1528 AD.\r\n\r\n   [2420] Rabī` II. 20th—January 1st 1529 AD.; Anglicé, Friday,\r\n   after 6p.m.\r\n\r\n   [2421] This \"Bengalī\" is territorial only; Naṣrat Shāh was a\r\n   Sayyid's son (f.271).\r\n\r\n   [2422] Ismā`īl Mītā (f. 357) who will have come with Mullā\r\n   Maẕhab.\r\n\r\n   [2423] _mī`ād_, cf. f. 350_b_ and f. 354_b_. Ghīāṣu'd-dīn may\r\n   have been a body-guard.\r\n\r\n   [2424] Lūdī Afghāns and their friends, including Bīban and\r\n   Bāyazīd.\r\n\r\n   [2425] _yūllūq tūrālīk_; _Memoirs_, p. 398, \"should act in\r\n   every respect in perfect conformity to his commands\";\r\n   _Mémoires_ ii, 379, \"_chacun suivant son rang et sa dignité_.\"\r\n\r\n   [2426] _tawāchī._ Bābur's uses of this word support Erskine in\r\n   saying that \"the _tawāchī_ is an officer who corresponds very\r\n   nearly to the Turkish _chāwush_, or special messenger\"\r\n   (Zenker, p. 346, col. iii) \"but he was also often employed to\r\n   act as a commissary for providing men and stores, as a\r\n   commissioner in superintending important affairs, as an\r\n   aide-de-camp in carrying orders, _etc._\"\r\n\r\n   [2427] Here the Ḥai. MS. has the full-vowelled form, _būljār_.\r\n   Judging from what that Codex writes, _būljār_ may be used for\r\n   a rendezvous of troops, _m:ljār_ or _b:ljār_ for any other\r\n   kind of tryst (f. 350, p. 628 n. 1; Index _s.nn._), also for a\r\n   shelter.\r\n\r\n   [2428] _yāwūshūb aīdī_, which I translate in accordance with\r\n   other uses of the verb, as meaning approach, but is taken by\r\n   some other workers to mean \"near its end\".\r\n\r\n   [2429] Though it is not explicitly said, Chīn-tīmūr may have\r\n   been met with on the road; as the \"also\" (_ham_) suggests.\r\n\r\n   [2430] To the above news the _Akbar-nāma_ adds the important\r\n   item reported by Humāyūn, that there was talk of peace. Bābur\r\n   replied that, if the time for negotiation were not past,\r\n   Humāyūn was to make peace until such time as the affairs of\r\n   Hindūstān were cleared off. This is followed in the A. N. by a\r\n   seeming quotation from Bābur's letter, saying in effect that\r\n   he was about to leave Hindūstān, and that his followers in\r\n   Kābul and Tramontana must prepare for the expedition against\r\n   Samarkand which would be made on his own arrival. None of the\r\n   above matter is now with the _Bābur-nāma_; either it was there\r\n   once, was used by Abū'l-faẓl and lost before the Persian trss.\r\n   were made; or Abū'l-faẓl used Bābur's original, or copied,\r\n   letter itself. That desire for peace prevailed is shewn by\r\n   several matters:—T̤ahmāsp, the victor, asked and obtained the\r\n   hand of an Aūzbeg in marriage; Aūzbeg envoys came to Āgra, and\r\n   with them Turk Khwājas having a mission likely to have been\r\n   towards peace (f. 357_b_); Bābur's wish for peace is shewn\r\n   above and on f. 359 in a summarized letter to Humāyūn. (Cf.\r\n   Abū'l-ghāzī's _Shajarat-i-Turk_ [_Histoire des Mongols_,\r\n   Désmaisons' trs. p. 216]; _Akbar-nāma_, H. B.'s trs. i, 270.)\r\n\r\n   A here-useful slip of reference is made by the translator of\r\n   the _Akbar-nāma_ (_l.c._ n. 3) to the Fragment (_Mémoires_ ii,\r\n   456) instead of to the _Bābur-nāma_ translation (_Mémoires_\r\n   ii, 381). The utility of the slip lies in its accompanying\r\n   comment that de C.'s translation is in closer agreement with\r\n   the _Akbar-nāma_ than with Bābur's words. Thus the\r\n   _Akbar-nāma_ passage is brought into comparison with what it\r\n   is now safe to regard as its off-shoot, through Turkī and\r\n   French, in the Fragment. When the above comment on their\r\n   resemblance was made, we were less assured than now as to the\r\n   genesis of the Fragment (Index _s.n._ Fragment).\r\n\r\n   [2431] Hind-āl's guardian (G. B.'s _Humāyūn-nāma_ trs. p. 106,\r\n   n. 1).\r\n\r\n   [2432] Nothing more about Humāyūn's expedition is found in the\r\n   B. N.; he left Badakhshān a few months later and arrived in\r\n   Āgra, after his mother (f. 380_b_), at a date in August of\r\n   which the record is wanting.\r\n\r\n   [2433] under 6 m. from Āgra. Gul-badan (f. 16) records a visit\r\n   to the garden, during which her father said he was weary of\r\n   sovereignty. Cf. f. 331_b_, p. 589 n. 2.\r\n\r\n   [2434] _kūrnīsh kīlkān kīshīlār._\r\n\r\n   [2435] MSS. vary or are indecisive as to the omitted word. I\r\n   am unable to fill the gap. Erskine has \"_Sir Māwineh_ (or\r\n   hair-twist)\" (p. 399), De Courteille, _Sir-mouïneh_ (ii, 382).\r\n   _Mūīna_ means ermine, sable and other fine fur\r\n   (_Shamsu'l-lūghāt_, p 274, col. 1).\r\n\r\n   [2436] His brother Ḥaẓrat Makhdūmī Nūrā (Khwāja Khāwand\r\n   Maḥmūd) is much celebrated by Ḥaidar Mīrzā, and Bābur\r\n   describes his own visit in the words he uses of the visit of\r\n   an inferior to himself. Cf. _Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_ trs. pp. 395,\r\n   478; _Akbar-nāma_ trs., i, 356, 360.\r\n\r\n   [2437] No record survives of the arrival of this envoy or of\r\n   why he was later in coming than his brother who was at Bābur's\r\n   entertainment. Cf. f. 361_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2438] Presumably this refers to the appliances mentioned on\r\n   f. 350_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2439] f. 332, n. 3.\r\n\r\n   [2440] _zarbaft m:l:k._ Amongst gold stuffs imported into\r\n   Hindūstān, Abū'l-faẓl mentions _mīlak_ which may be Bābur's\r\n   cloth. It came from Turkistān (A.-i-A. Blochmann, p. 92 and\r\n   n.).\r\n\r\n   [2441] A _tang_ is a small silver coin of the value of about a\r\n   penny (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [2442] _tānglāsī_, lit. at its dawning. It is not always clear\r\n   whether _tānglāsī_ means, Anglicé, next dawn or day, which\r\n   here would be Monday, or whether it stands for the dawn\r\n   (daylight) of the Muḥammadan day which had begun at 6 p. m. on\r\n   the previous evening, here Sunday. When Bābur records, _e.g._\r\n   a late audience, _tānglāsī_, following, will stand for the\r\n   daylight of the day of audience. The point is of some\r\n   importance as bearing on discrepancies of days, as these are\r\n   stated in MSS., with European calendars; it is conspicuously\r\n   so in Bābur's diary sections.\r\n\r\n   [2443] _risālat ṯarīqī bīla_; their special mission may have\r\n   been to work for peace (f. 359_b_, n. 1).\r\n\r\n   [2444] He may well be Kāmrān's father-in-law Sl. `Alī Mīrzā\r\n   T̤aghāī _Begchīk_.\r\n\r\n   [2445] _nīmcha u takband._ The _tak-band_ is a silk or woollen\r\n   girdle fastening with a \"hook and eye\" (Steingass), perhaps\r\n   with a buckle.\r\n\r\n   [2446] This description is that of the contents of the\r\n   \"_Rāmpūr Dīwān_\"; the _tarjuma_ being the _Wālidiyyah-risāla_\r\n   (f. 361 and n.). What is said here shows that four copies went\r\n   to Kābul or further north. Cf. Appendix Q.\r\n\r\n   [2447] _Sar-khaṯ_ may mean \"copies\" set for Kāmrān to imitate.\r\n\r\n   [2448] _bīr pahr yāwūshūb aīdī_; I.O. 215 f. 221, _qarīb yak\r\n   pās roz būd_.\r\n\r\n   [2449] _ākhar_, a word which may reveal a bad start and\r\n   uncertainty as to when and where to halt.\r\n\r\n   [2450] This, and not Chandwār (f. 331_b_), appears the correct\r\n   form. Neither this place nor Ābāpūr is mentioned in the G. of\r\n   I.'s Index or shewn in the I.S. Map of 1900 (cf. f. 331_b_ n.\r\n   3). Chandawār lies s.w. of Fīrūzābād, and near a village\r\n   called Ṣufīpūr.\r\n\r\n   [2451] Anglicé, Wednesday after 6 p.m.\r\n\r\n   [2452] or life-guardsman, body-guard.\r\n\r\n   [2453] This higher title for T̤ahmāsp, which first appears\r\n   here in the B.N., may be an early slip in the Turkī text,\r\n   since it occurs in many MSS. and also because \"Shāh-zāda\"\r\n   reappears on f. 359.\r\n\r\n   [2454] Slash-face, _balafré_; perhaps Ibrāhīm _Begchīk_ (Index\r\n   _s.n._), but it is long since he was mentioned by Bābur, at\r\n   least by name. He may however have come, at this time of\r\n   reunion in Āgra, with Mīrzā Beg T̤aghāī (his uncle or\r\n   brother?), father-in-law of Kāmrān.\r\n\r\n   [2455] The army will have kept to the main road connecting the\r\n   larger towns mentioned and avoiding the ravine district of the\r\n   Jumna. What the boat-journey will have been between high banks\r\n   and round remarkable bends can be learned from the G. of I.\r\n   and Neave's _District Gazetteer of Mainpūrī_. Rāprī is on the\r\n   road from Fīrūzābād to the ferry for Bateswar, where a large\r\n   fair is held annually. (It is misplaced further east in the\r\n   I.S. Map of 1900.) There are two Fatḥpūrs, n. e. of Rāprī.\r\n\r\n   [2456] _aūlūgh tūghāīnīng tūbī._ Here it suits to take the\r\n   Turkī word _tūghāī_ to mean bend of a river, and as referring\r\n   to the one shaped (on the map) like a soda-water bottle, its\r\n   neck close to Rāprī. Bābur avoided it by taking boat below its\r\n   mouth.—In neither Persian translation has _tūghāī_ been read\r\n   to mean a bend of a river; the first has _az pāyān rūīa\r\n   Rāprī_, perhaps referring to the important ford (_pāyān_); the\r\n   second has _az zīr bulandī kalān Rāprī_, perhaps referring to\r\n   a height at the meeting of the bank of the ravine down which\r\n   the road to the ford comes, with the high bank of the river.\r\n   Three examples of _tūghāī_ or _tūqāī_ [a synonym given by\r\n   Dictionaries], can be seen in Abū'l-ghāzī's _Shajrat-i-Turk_,\r\n   Fraehn's imprint, pp. 106, 107, 119 (Désmaisons' trs. pp. 204,\r\n   205, 230). In each instance Désmaisons renders it by _coude_,\r\n   elbow, but one of the examples may need reconsideration, since\r\n   the word has the further meanings of wood, dense forest by the\r\n   side of a river (Vambéry), prairie (Zenker), and reedy plain\r\n   (Shaw).\r\n\r\n   [2457] Blochmann describes the apparatus for marking lines to\r\n   guide writing (A.-i-A. trs. p. 52 n. 5):—On a card of the size\r\n   of the page to be written on, two vertical lines are drawn\r\n   within an inch of the edges; along these lines small holes are\r\n   pierced at regular intervals, and through these a string is\r\n   laced backwards and forwards, care being taken that the\r\n   horizontal strings are parallel. Over the lines of string the\r\n   pages are placed and pressed down; the strings then mark the\r\n   paper sufficiently to guide the writing.\r\n\r\n   [2458] _tarkīb (nīng) khaṯī bīla tarjuma bīlīr aūchūn._ The\r\n   _Rāmpūr Dīwān_ may supply the explanation of the uncertain\r\n   words _tarkīb khaṯī_. The \"translation\" (_tarjuma_), mentioned\r\n   in the passage quoted above, is the _Wālidiyyah-risāla_, the\r\n   first item of the _Dīwān_, in which it is entered on crowded\r\n   pages, specially insufficient for the larger hand of the\r\n   chapter-headings. The number of lines per page is 13; Bābur\r\n   now fashions a line-marker for 11. He has already despatched 4\r\n   copies of the translation (f. 357_b_); he will have judged\r\n   them unsatisfactory; hence to give space for the mixture of\r\n   hands (_tarkīb khaṯī_), _i.e._ the smaller hand of the poem\r\n   and the larger of the headings, he makes an 11 line marker.\r\n\r\n   [2459] Perhaps Aḥrārī's in the _Wālidiyyah-risāla_, perhaps\r\n   those of Muḥammad. A quatrain in the _Rāmpūr Dīwān_ connects\r\n   with this admonishment [Plate xiv_a_, 2nd quatrain].\r\n\r\n   [2460] Jākhān (_G. of Mainpūrī_). The _G. of Etāwa_\r\n   (Drake-Brockman) p. 213, gives this as some 18 m. n.w. of\r\n   Etāwa and as lying amongst the ravines of the Jumna.\r\n\r\n   [2461] f. 359_b_ allows some of the particulars to be known.\r\n\r\n   [2462] Mahdī may have come to invite Bābur to the luncheon he\r\n   served shortly afterwards. The Ḥai. MS. gives him the\r\n   honorific plural; either a second caller was with him or an\r\n   early scribe has made a slip, since Bābur never so-honours\r\n   Mahdī. This small point touches the larger one of how Bābur\r\n   regarded him, and this in connection with the singular story\r\n   Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad tells in his _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_ about\r\n   Khalīfa's wish to supplant Humāyūn by Mahdī Khwāja (Index\r\n   _s.nn._).\r\n\r\n   [2463] _yīgītlārnī shokhlūqgha sāldūq_, perhaps set them to\r\n   make fun. Cf. f. 366, _yīgītlār bīr pāra shokhlūq qīldīlār_.\r\n   Muḥ. _Shīrāzī_ (p. 323 _foot_) makes the startling addition of\r\n   _dar āb_ (_andākhtīm_), _i.e._ he says that the royal party\r\n   flung the braves into the river.\r\n\r\n   [2464] The _Gazetteer of Etāwa_ (Drake-Brockman) p. 186,\r\n   _s.n._ Bāburpūr, writes of two village sites [which from their\r\n   position are Mūrī-and-Adūsa], as known by the name Sarāī\r\n   Bāburpūr from having been Bābur's halting-place. They are 24m.\r\n   to the s.e. of Etāwa, on the old road for Kālpī. Near the name\r\n   Bāburpūr in the Gazetteer Map there is Muhuri (Mūrī?); there\r\n   is little or no doubt that Sarāī Bāburpūr represents the\r\n   camping-ground Mūrī-and-Adūsa.\r\n\r\n   [2465] This connects with Kītīn-qarā's complaints of the\r\n   frontier-begs (f. 361), and with the talk of peace (f.\r\n   356_b_).\r\n\r\n   [2466] This injunction may connect with the desired peace; it\r\n   will have been prompted by at least a doubt in Bābur's mind as\r\n   to Kāmrān's behaviour perhaps _e.g._ in manifested dislike for\r\n   a Shīa`. Concerning the style Shāh-zāda _see_ f. 358, p. 643,\r\n   n. 1.\r\n\r\n   [2467] Kāmrān's mother Gul-rukh _Begchīk_ will have been of\r\n   the party who will have tried in Kābul to forward her son's\r\n   interests.\r\n\r\n   [2468] f. 348, p. 624, n. 2.\r\n\r\n   [2469] Kābul and Tramontana.\r\n\r\n   [2470] Presumably that of Shamsu'd-dīn Muḥammad's mission. One\r\n   of Bābur's couplets expresses longing for the fruits, and also\r\n   for the \"running waters\", of lands other than Hindūstān, with\r\n   conceits recalling those of his English contemporaries in\r\n   verse, as indeed do several others of his short poems (_Rāmpūr\r\n   Dīwān_ Plate xvii A.).\r\n\r\n   [2471] Ḥai. MS. _nā marbūṯlīghī_; so too the 2nd Pers. trs.\r\n   but the 1st writes _wairānī u karābī_ which suits the matter\r\n   of defence.\r\n\r\n   [2472] _qūrghān_, walled-town; from the _maẓbūt_ following,\r\n   the defences are meant.\r\n\r\n   [2473] _viz._ Governor Khwāja Kalān, on whose want of\r\n   dominance his sovereign makes good-natured reflection.\r\n\r\n   [2474] _`alūfa u qūnāl_; cf. 364_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2475] Following _aīlchī_ (envoys) there is in the Ḥai. MS.\r\n   and in I.O. 217 a doubtful word, _būmla_, _yūmla_; I.O. 215\r\n   (which contains a Persian trs. of the letter) is obscure,\r\n   Ilminsky changes the wording slightly; Erskine has a free\r\n   translation. Perhaps it is _yaumī_, daily, misplaced (_see_\r\n   above).\r\n\r\n   [2476] Perhaps, endow the Mosque so as to leave no right of\r\n   property in its revenues to their donor, here Bābur. Cf.\r\n   Hughes' _Dict. of Islām_ s.nn. _sharī`_, _masjid_ and _waqf_.\r\n\r\n   [2477] f. 139. Khwāja Kalān himself had taken from Hindūstān\r\n   the money for repairing this dam.\r\n\r\n   [2478] _sāpqūn ālīp_; the 2nd Pers. trs. as if from _sātqūn\r\n   ālīp_, _kharīda_, purchasing.\r\n\r\n   [2479] _naẕar-gāh_, perhaps, theatre, as showing the play\r\n   enacted at the ford. Cf. ff. 137, 236, 248_b_. Tūtūn-dara will\r\n   be Masson's Tūtām-dara. Erskine locates Tūtūn-dara some 8\r\n   _kos_ (16 m.) n. w. of Hūpīān (Ūpīān). Masson shews that it\r\n   was a charming place (_Journeys in Biluchistan, Afghanistan\r\n   and the Panj-āb_, vol. iii, cap. vi and vii).\r\n\r\n   [2480] _jībachī._ Bābur's injunction seems to refer to the\r\n   maintaining of the corps and the manufacture of armour rather\r\n   than to care for the individual men involved.\r\n\r\n   [2481] Either the armies in Nīl-āb, or the women in the\r\n   Kābul-country (f. 375).\r\n\r\n   [2482] Perhaps what Bābur means is, that both what he had said\r\n   to `Abdu'l-lāh and what the quatrain expresses, are dissuasive\r\n   from repentance. Erskine writes (_Mems._ p. 403) but without\r\n   textual warrant, \"I had resolution enough to persevere\"; de\r\n   Courteille (_Mems._ ii, 390), \"_Voici un quatrain qui exprime\r\n   au juste les difficultés de ma position._\"\r\n\r\n   [2483] The surface retort seems connected with the jacket,\r\n   perhaps with a request for the gift of it.\r\n\r\n   [2484] Clearly what recalled this joke of Banāī's long-silent,\r\n   caustic tongue was that its point lay ostensibly in a baffled\r\n   wish—in `Alī-sher's professed desire to be generous and a\r\n   professed impediment, which linked in thought with Bābur's\r\n   desire for wine, baffled by his abjuration. So much Banāī's\r\n   smart verbal retort shows, but beneath this is the\r\n   _double-entendre_ which cuts at the Beg as miserly and as\r\n   physically impotent, a defect which gave point to another jeer\r\n   at his expense, one chronicled by Sām Mīrzā and translated in\r\n   Hammer-Purgstall's _Geschichte von schönen Redekünste\r\n   Persiens_, art. CLV. (Cf. f. 179-80.)—The word _mādagī_ is\r\n   used metaphorically for a button-hole; like _nā-mardī_, it\r\n   carries secondary meanings, miserliness, impotence, _etc._\r\n   (Cf. Wollaston's _English-Persian Dictionary_ _s.n._\r\n   button-hole, where only we have found _mādagī_ with this\r\n   sense.)\r\n\r\n   [2485] The 1st Pers. trs. expresses \"all these jokes\", thus\r\n   including with the double-meanings of _mādagī_, the jests of\r\n   the quatrain.\r\n\r\n   [2486] The 1st Pers. trs. fills out Bābur's allusive phrase\r\n   here with \"of the _Wālidiyyah_\". His wording allows the\r\n   inference that what he versified was a prose Turkī translation\r\n   of a probably Arabic original.\r\n\r\n   [2487] Erskine comments here on the non-translation into\r\n   Persian of Bābur's letters. Many MSS., however, contain a\r\n   translation (f. 348, p. 624, n. 2 and E.'s n. f. 377_b_).\r\n\r\n   [2488] Anglicé, Thursday after 6 p.m.\r\n\r\n   [2489] What would suit measurement on maps and also Bābur's\r\n   route is \"Jumoheen\" which is marked where the Sarāī\r\n   Bāburpūr-Atsu-Phaphand road turns south, east of Phaphand\r\n   (I.S. Map of 1900, Sheet 68).\r\n\r\n   [2490] var. _Qabāq_, _Qatāk_, _Qanāk_, to each of which a\r\n   meaning might be attached. Bābur had written to Humāyūn about\r\n   the frontier affair, as one touching the desired peace (f.\r\n   359).\r\n\r\n   [2491] This will refer to the late arrival in Āgra of the\r\n   envoy named, who was not with his younger brother at the feast\r\n   of f. 351_b_ (f. 357, p. 641, n. 2).—As to T̤ahmāsp's style,\r\n   see f. 354, f. 358.\r\n\r\n   [2492] Shāh-qulī may be the ill-informed narrator of f. 354.\r\n\r\n   [2493] Both are marked on the southward road from Jumoheen\r\n   (Jumandnā?) for Auraiya.\r\n\r\n   [2494] The old Kālpī _pargana_ having been sub-divided,\r\n   Dīrapūr is now in the district of Cawnpore (Kānhpūr).\r\n\r\n   [2495] That this operation was not hair-cutting but\r\n   head-shaving is shewn by the verbs T. _qīrmāq_ and its Pers.\r\n   trs. _tarāsh kardan_. To shave the head frequently is common\r\n   in Central Asia.\r\n\r\n   [2496] This will be Chaparghatta on the\r\n   Dīrapūr-Bhognīpūr-Chaparghatta-Mūsanagar road, the affixes\r\n   _kada_ and _ghatta_ both meaning house, temple, _etc._\r\n\r\n   [2497] Māhīm, and with her the child Gul-badan, came in\r\n   advance of the main body of women. Bābur seems to refer again\r\n   to her assumption of royal style by calling her Walī, Governor\r\n   (f. 369 and n.). It is unusual that no march or halt is\r\n   recorded on this day.\r\n\r\n   [2498] or, Ārampūr. We have not succeeded in finding this\r\n   place; it seems to have been on the west bank of the Jumna,\r\n   since twice Bābur when on the east bank, writes of coming\r\n   opposite to it (_supra_ and f. 379). If no move was made on\r\n   Tuesday, Jumāda II. 6th (cf. last note), the distance entered\r\n   as done on Wednesday would locate the halting-place somewhere\r\n   near the Akbarpūr of later name, which stands on a road and at\r\n   a ferry. But if the army did a stage on Tuesday, of which\r\n   Bābur omits mention, Wednesday's march might well bring him\r\n   opposite to Hamirpūr and to the \"Rampur\"-ferry. The verbal\r\n   approximation of Ārampūr and \"Rampur\" arrests attention.—Local\r\n   encroachment by the river, which is recorded in the District\r\n   Gazetteers, may have something to do with the disappearance\r\n   from these most useful books and from maps, of _pargana_\r\n   Ādampūr (or, Ārampūr).\r\n\r\n   [2499] _tūshlāb._ It suits best here, since solitude is the\r\n   speciality of the excursion, to read _tūshmāk_ as meaning to\r\n   take the road, Fr. _cheminer_.\r\n\r\n   [2500] _da`wī bīla_; _Mems._ p. 404, challenge; _Méms._ ii,\r\n   391, _il avait fait des façons_, a truth probably, but one\r\n   inferred only.\r\n\r\n   [2501] This will be more to the south than Kūra Khas, the\r\n   headquarters of the large district; perhaps it is \"Koora\r\n   Khera\" (? Kūra-khirāj) which suits the route (I.S. Map, Sheet\r\n   88).\r\n\r\n   [2502] Perhaps Kunda Kanak, known also as \"Kuria, Koria, Kura\r\n   and Kunra Kanak\" (_D.G. of Fatḥpūr_).\r\n\r\n   [2503] Haswa or Hanswa. The conjoint name represents two\r\n   villages some 6m. apart, and is today that of their\r\n   railway-station.\r\n\r\n   [2504] almost due east of Fatḥpūr, on the old King's Highway\r\n   (_Bādshāhī Sar-rāh_).\r\n\r\n   [2505] His ancestors had ruled in Jūnpūr from 1394 to 1476\r\n   AD., his father Ḥusain Shāh having been conquered by Sl.\r\n   Sikandar _Lūdī_ at the latter date. He was one of three rivals\r\n   for supremacy in the East (_Sharq_), the others being\r\n   Jalālu'd-dīn _Nūhānī_ and Maḥmūd _Lūdī_,—Afghāns all three.\r\n   Cf. Erskine's _History of India, Bābur_, i, 501.\r\n\r\n   [2506] This name appears on the I.S. Map, Sheet 88, but too\r\n   far north to suit Bābur's distances, and also off the Sarāī\r\n   Munda-Kusār-Karrah road. The position of Naubasta suits\r\n   better.\r\n\r\n   [2507] Sher Khān was associated with Dūdū Bībī in the charge\r\n   of her son's affairs. Bābur's favours to him, his son\r\n   Humāyūn's future conqueror, will have been done during the\r\n   Eastern campaign in 934 AH., of which so much record is\r\n   missing. Cf. _Tārīkh-i-sher-shāhī_, E. & D.'s _History of\r\n   India_, iv, 301 _et seq._ for particulars of Sher Khān (Farīd\r\n   Khān _Sūr Afghān_).\r\n\r\n   [2508] In writing \"Sl. Maḥmūd\", Bābur is reporting his\r\n   informant's style, he himself calling Maḥmūd \"Khān\" only (f.\r\n   363 and f. 363_b_).\r\n\r\n   [2509] This will be the more northerly of two Kusārs marked as\r\n   in Karrah; even so, it is a very long 6 _kurohs_ (12m.) from\r\n   the Dugdugī of the I.S. Map (cf. n. _supra_).\r\n\r\n   [2510] _bīr pāra āsh u ta`ām_, words which suggest one of\r\n   those complete meals served, each item on its separate small\r\n   dish, and all dishes fitting like mosaic into one tray. T.\r\n   _āsh_ is cooked meat (f. 2 n. 1 and f. 343_b_); Ar. _ta`ām_\r\n   will be sweets, fruit, bread, perhaps rice also.\r\n\r\n   [2511] The _yaktāī_, one-fold coat, contrasts with the\r\n   _dū-tāhī_, two-fold (A.-i-A. Bib. Ind. ed., p. 101, and\r\n   Blochmann's trs. p. 88).\r\n\r\n   [2512] This acknowledgement of right to the style Sulṯān\r\n   recognized also supremacy of the Sharqī claim to rule over\r\n   that of the Nūḥānī and _Lūdī_ competitors.\r\n\r\n   [2513] _mīndīn bītī tūrgān waqāī'._ This passage Teufel used\r\n   to support his view that Bābur's title for his book was\r\n   _Waqāī`_, and not _Bābur-nāma_ which, indeed, Teufel describes\r\n   as the _Kazaner Ausgabe adoptirte Titel_. _Bābur-nāma_,\r\n   however, is the title [or perhaps, merely scribe's name]\r\n   associated both with Kehr's text and with the Ḥaidarābād\r\n   Codex.—I have found no indication of the selection by Bābur of\r\n   any title; he makes no mention of the matter and where he uses\r\n   the word _waqāī`_ or its congeners, it can be read as a common\r\n   noun. In his colophon to the _Rāmpūr Dīwān_, it is a parallel\r\n   of _ash`ār_, poems. Judging from what is found in the _Mubīn_,\r\n   it may be right to infer that, if he had lived to complete his\r\n   book—now broken off _s.a._ 914 AH. (f. 216_b_)—he would have\r\n   been explicit as to its title, perhaps also as to his grounds\r\n   for choosing it. Such grounds would have found fitting mention\r\n   in a preface to the now abrupt opening of the _Bābur-nāma_ (f.\r\n   1_b_), and if the _Malfūzāt-i-tīmūrī_ be Tīmūr's authentic\r\n   autobiography, this book might have been named as an ancestral\r\n   example influencing Bābur to write his own. Nothing against\r\n   the authenticity of the _Malfūzāt_ can be inferred from the\r\n   circumstance that Bābur does not name it, because the preface\r\n   in which such mention would be in harmony with _e.g._ his\r\n   _Walidiyyah_ preface, was never written. It might accredit the\r\n   _Malfūzāt_ to collate passages having common topics, as they\r\n   appear in the _Bābur-nāma_, _Malfūzāt-i-tīmūrī_ and\r\n   _Z̤afar-nāma_ (cf. E. & D.'s H. of I. iv, 559 for a discussion\r\n   by Dr. Sachau and Prof. Dowson on the _Malfūzāt_). (Cf. Z.D.M.\r\n   xxxvii, p. 184, Teufel's art. _Bābur und Abū'l-faẓl_;\r\n   Smirnow's Cat. of _Manuscrits Turcs_, p. 142; Index _in loco_\r\n   _s.nn._ _Mubīn_ and Title.)\r\n\r\n   [2514] Koh-khirāj, Revenue-paying Koh (H. G. Nevill's _D.

Both, as\r\n   Bābur has said, were descendants of Khwāja `Ubaidu'l-lāh\r\n   _Aḥrārī_. Khwāja Kalān was a grandson of Aḥrārī's second son\r\n   Yahyā; Khwāja `Abdu'sh-shahīd was the son of his fifth, Khwāja\r\n   `Abdu'l-lāh (Khwājagān-khwāja). `Abdu'sh-shahīd returned to\r\n   India under Akbar, received a fief, maintained 2,000 poor\r\n   persons, left after 20 years, and died in Samarkand in 982\r\n   AH.-1574-5 AD. (A.-i-A., Blochmann's trs. and notes, pp. 423,\r\n   539).\r\n\r\n   [2517] f. 363, f. 363_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2518] Not found on maps; OOjani or Ujahni about suits the\r\n   measured distance.\r\n\r\n   [2519] Prayāg, Ilāhābād, Allāhābād. Between the asterisk in my\r\n   text (_supra_) and the one following \"ford\" before the\r\n   foliation mark f. 364, the Ḥai. MS. has a _lacuna_ which, as\r\n   being preceded and followed by broken sentences, can hardly be\r\n   due to a scribe's skip, but may result from the loss of a\r\n   folio. What I have entered above between the asterisks is\r\n   translated from the Kehr-Ilminsky text; it is in the two\r\n   Persian translations also. Close scrutiny of it suggests that\r\n   down to the end of the swimming episode it is not in order and\r\n   that the account of the swim across the Ganges may be a\r\n   survival of the now missing record of 934 AH. (f. 339). It is\r\n   singular that the Pers. trss. make no mention of Pīāg or of\r\n   Sīr-auliya; their omission arouses speculation, as to in which\r\n   text, the Turkī or Persian, it was first tried to fill what\r\n   remains a gap in the Ḥai. Codex. A second seeming sign of\r\n   disorder is the incomplete sentence _yūrtgha kīlīb_, which is\r\n   noted below. A third is the crowd of incidents now standing\r\n   under \"Tuesday\". A fourth, and an important matter, is that on\r\n   grounds noted at the end of the swimming passage (p. 655 n. 3)\r\n   it is doubtful whether that passage is in its right place.—It\r\n   may be that some-one, at an early date after Bābur's death,\r\n   tried to fill the _lacuna_ discovered in his manuscript, with\r\n   help from loose folios or parts of them. Cf. Index _s.n._\r\n   swimming, and f. 377_b_, p. 680 n. 2.\r\n\r\n   [2520] The Chaghatāī sulṯāns will have been with `Askarī east\r\n   of the Ganges.\r\n\r\n   [2521] _tūr hawālīk_; _Mems._ p. 406, violence of the wind;\r\n   _Méms_. ii, 398, _une température très agréable_.\r\n\r\n   [2522] _yūrtgha kīlīb_, an incomplete sentence.\r\n\r\n   [2523] _ārāl bār aīkāndūr_, phrasing implying uncertainty;\r\n   there may have been an island, or such a peninsula as a\r\n   narrow-mouthed bend of a river forms, or a spit or bluff\r\n   projecting into the river. The word _ārāl_ represents\r\n   _Aīkī-sū-ārāsī_, _Miyān-dū-āb_, _Entre-eaux_,\r\n   Twixt-two-streams, Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\n   [2524] _qūl_; Pers. trss. _dast andākhtan_ and _dast_.\r\n   Presumably the 33 strokes carried the swimmer across the deep\r\n   channel, or the Ganges was crossed higher than Pīāg.\r\n\r\n   [2525] The above account of Bābur's first swim across the\r\n   Ganges which is entered under date Jumāda II. 27th, 935 AH.\r\n   (March 8th, 1529 AD.), appears misplaced, since he mentions\r\n   under date Rajab 25th, 935 AH. (April 4th, 1529 AD. f.\r\n   366_b_), that he had swum the Ganges at Baksara (Buxar) a year\r\n   before, _i.e._ on or close to Rajab 25th, 934 AH. (April 15th,\r\n   1528 AD.). Nothing in his writings shews that he was near Pīāg\r\n   (Allāhābād) in 934 AH.; nothing indisputably connects the\r\n   swimming episode with the \"Tuesday\" below which it now stands;\r\n   there is no help given by dates. One supposes Bābur would take\r\n   his first chance to swim the Ganges; this was offered at\r\n   Qanauj (f. 336), but nothing in the short record of that time\r\n   touches the topic. The next chance would be after he was in\r\n   Aūd, when, by an unascertained route, perhaps down the Ghogrā,\r\n   he made his way to Baksara where he says (f. 366_b_) he swam\r\n   the river. Taking into consideration the various testimony\r\n   noted, [Index _s.n._ swimming] there seems warrant for\r\n   supposing that this swimming passage is a survival of the\r\n   missing record of 934 AH. (f. 339). Cf. f. 377_b_, p. 680 and\r\n   n. 2 for another surmised survival of 934 AH.\r\n\r\n   [2526] \"Friday\" here stands for Anglicé, Thursday after 6\r\n   p.m.; this, only, suiting Bābur's next explicit date Sha`bān\r\n   1st, Saturday.\r\n\r\n   [2527] The march, beginning on the Jumna, is now along the\r\n   united rivers.\r\n\r\n   [2528] _ẓarb-zanlīk arābalār._ Here the carts are those\r\n   carrying the guns.\r\n\r\n   [2529] From the particulars Bābur gives about the Tūs (Tons)\r\n   and Karmā-nāśā, it would seem that he had not passed them\r\n   last year, an inference supported by what is known of his\r\n   route in that year:—He came from Gūālīār to the Kanār-passage\r\n   (f. 336), there crossed the Jumna and went direct to Qanauj\r\n   (f. 335), above Qanauj bridged the Ganges, went on to\r\n   Bangarmāu (f. 338), crossed the Gūmtī and went to near the\r\n   junction of the Ghogrā and Sardā (f. 338_b_). The next\r\n   indication of his route is that he is at Baksara, but whether\r\n   he reached it by water down the Ghogrā, as his meeting with\r\n   Muḥ. Ma`rūf _Farmūlī_ suggests (f. 377), or by land, nothing\r\n   shews. From Baksara (f. 366) he went up-stream to Chausa (f.\r\n   365_b_), on perhaps to Sayyidpūr, 2m. from the mouth of the\r\n   Gūmtī, and there left the Ganges for Jūnpūr (f. 365). I have\r\n   found nothing about his return route to Āgra; it seems\r\n   improbable that he would go so far south as to near Pīāg; a\r\n   more northerly and direct road to Fatḥpūr and Sarāī Bāburpūr\r\n   may have been taken.—Concerning Bābur's acts in 934 AH. the\r\n   following item, (met with since I was working on 934 AH.),\r\n   continues his statement (f. 338_b_) that he spent a few days\r\n   near Aūd (Ajōdhya) to settle its affairs. The _D.G. of\r\n   Fyzābāa_ (H. E. Nevill) p. 173 says \"In 1528 AD. Bābur came to\r\n   Ajōdhya (Aūd) and halted a week. He destroyed the ancient\r\n   temple\" (marking the birth-place of Rāma) \"and on its site\r\n   built a mosque, still known as Bābur's Mosque.... It has two\r\n   inscriptions, one on the outside, one on the pulpit; both are\r\n   in Persian; and bear the date 935 _AH._\" This date may be that\r\n   of the completion of the building.—(_Corrigendum_:—On f. 339\r\n   n. 1, I have too narrowly restricted the use of the name\r\n   Sarjū. Bābur used it to describe what the maps of Arrowsmith\r\n   and Johnson shew, and not only what the _Gazetteer of India_\r\n   map of the United Provinces does. It applies to the Sardā (f.\r\n   339) as Bābur uses it when writing of the fords.)\r\n\r\n   [2530] Here the lacuna of the Ḥai.

Sikandar _Lūdī_.\r\n   Sher Khān _Sūr_ married his widow \"Guhar Kusāīn\", bringing him\r\n   a large dowry (A.N. trs. p. 327; and _Tārīkh-i-sher-shāhi_, E.\r\n   & D.'s _History of India_ iv, 346).\r\n\r\n   [2549] He started from Chaparghatta (f. 361_b_, p. 650 n. 1).\r\n\r\n   [2550] _yīl-tūrgī yūrt._\r\n\r\n   [2551] \"This must have been the Eclipse of the 10th of May\r\n   1528 AD.; a fast is enjoined on the day of an eclipse\"\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [2552] Karmā-nā['s]ā means loss of the merit acquired by good\r\n   works.\r\n\r\n   [2553] The I.S.

Gang-sūī-dīn mīn dastak bīla aūtūb, ba`ẓī\r\n   āt, ba`ẓī tīwah mīnīb, kīlīb, sair qīlīlīb aīdī._ Some\r\n   uncertainty as to the meaning of the phrase _dastak bīla\r\n   aūtūb_ is caused by finding that while here de Courteille\r\n   agrees with Erskine in taking it to mean swimming, he varies\r\n   later (f. 373_b_) to _appuyés sur une pièce de bois_. Taking\r\n   the Persian translations of three passages about crossing\r\n   water into consideration (p. 655 after f. 363_b_, f. 366_b_\r\n   (here), f. 373_b_), and also the circumstances that E. and de\r\n   C. are once in agreement and that Erskine worked with the help\r\n   of Oriental _munshīs_, I incline to think that _dastak bīla_\r\n   does express swimming.—The question of its precise meaning\r\n   bears on one concerning Bābur's first swim across the Ganges\r\n   (p. 655, n. 3).—Perhaps I should say, however, that if the\r\n   sentence quoted at the head of this note stood alone, without\r\n   the extraneous circumstances supporting the reading of _dastak\r\n   bīla_ to mean swimming, I should incline to read it as stating\r\n   that Bābur went on foot through the water, feeling his footing\r\n   with a pole (_dastak_), and that his followers rode through\r\n   the ford after him. Nothing in the quoted passage suggests\r\n   that the horses and camels swam. But whether the Ganges was\r\n   fordable at Baksara in Bābur's time, is beyond surmise.\r\n\r\n   [2559] _faṣl soz_, which, manifestly, were to be laid before\r\n   the envoy's master. The articles are nowhere specified; one is\r\n   summarized merely on f. 365. The incomplete sentence of the\r\n   Turkī text (_supra_) needs their specification at this place,\r\n   and an explicit statement of them would have made clearer the\r\n   political relations of Bābur with Naṣrat Shāh.—A folio may\r\n   have been lost from Bābur's manuscript; it might have\r\n   specified the articles, and also have said something leading\r\n   to the next topic of the diary, now needing preliminaries,\r\n   _viz._ that of the Mīrzā's discontent with his new\r\n   appointment, a matter not mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n   [2560] This suits Bābur's series, but Gladwin and Wüstenfeld\r\n   have 10th.\r\n\r\n   [2561] The first is near, the second on the direct road from\r\n   Buxar for Ārrah.\r\n\r\n   [2562] The Ḥai. MS. makes an elephant be posted as the sole\r\n   scout; others post a _sardār_, or post braves; none post man\r\n   and beast.\r\n\r\n   [2563] This should be 5th; perhaps the statement is confused\r\n   through the gifts being given late, Anglicé, on Tuesday 4th,\r\n   Islamicé on Wednesday night.\r\n\r\n   [2564] The Mīrzā's Tīmūrid birth and a desire in Bābur to give\r\n   high status to a representative he will have wished to leave\r\n   in Bihār when he himself went to his western dominions,\r\n   sufficiently explain the bestowal of this sign of sovereignty.\r\n\r\n   [2565] _jīrgā._ This instance of its use shews that Bābur had\r\n   in mind not a completed circle, but a line, or in sporting\r\n   parlance, not a hunting-circle but a beaters'-line. [Cf. f.\r\n   251, f. 364_b_ and _infra_ of the crocodile.] The word is used\r\n   also for a governing-circle, a tribal-council.\r\n\r\n   [2566] _aūlūgh_ (_kīma_). Does _aūlūgh_ (_aūlūq_, _ūlūq_)\r\n   connect with the \"bulky Oolak or baggage-boat of Bengal\"?\r\n   (_Hobson-Jobson_ _s.n._ Woolock, oolock).\r\n\r\n   [2567] De Courteille's reading of Ilminsky's \"Bāburī\" (p. 476)\r\n   as Bāīrī, old servant, hardly suits the age of the boat.\r\n\r\n   [2568] Bābur anticipated the custom followed _e.g._ by the\r\n   White Star and Cunard lines, when he gave his boats names\r\n   having the same terminal syllable; his is _āīsh_; on it he\r\n   makes the quip of the har _āīsh_ of the Farmāīsh.\r\n\r\n   [2569] As Vullers makes Ar. _ghurfat_ a synonym of\r\n   _chaukandī_, the Farmāīsh seems likely to have had a cabin,\r\n   open at the sides. De Courteille understood it to have a\r\n   rounded stern. [Cf. E. & D.'s _History of India_ v, 347, 503\r\n   n.; and Gul-badan's H. N. trs. p. 98, n. 2.]\r\n\r\n   [2570] _mīndīn rukhṣat āldī_; phrasing which bespeaks admitted\r\n   equality, that of Tīmūrid birth.\r\n\r\n   [2571] _i.e._ subjects of the Afghān ruler of Bengal; many\r\n   will have been Bihārīs and Pūrbiyas. Makhdūm-i-`ālam was\r\n   Naṣrat Shāh's Governor in Ḥājīpūr.\r\n\r\n   [2572] This might imply that the Afghāns had been prevented\r\n   from joining Maḥmūd Khān _Lūdī_ near the Son.\r\n\r\n   [2573] Sl. Muḥammad Shāh _Nūḥānī Afghān_, the former ruler of\r\n   Bihār, dead within a year. He had trained Farīd Khān _Sūr_ in\r\n   the management of government affairs; had given him, for\r\n   gallant encounter with a tiger, the title Sher Khān by which,\r\n   or its higher form Sher Shāh, history knows him, and had made\r\n   him his young son's \"deputy\", an office Sher Khān held after\r\n   the father's death in conjunction with the boy's mother Dūdū\r\n   Bībī (_Tārīkh-i-sher-shāhī_, E. & D.'s _History of India_ iv,\r\n   325 _et seq._).\r\n\r\n   [2574] _gūz bāghī yūsūnlūq_; by which I understand they were\r\n   held fast from departure, as _e.g._ a mouse by the fascination\r\n   of a snake.\r\n\r\n   [2575] f. 365 mentions a letter which may have announced their\r\n   intention.\r\n\r\n   [2576] Ganges; they thus evaded the restriction made good on\r\n   other Afghāns.\r\n\r\n   [2577] Anglicé, Saturday 8th after 6 p.m.\r\n\r\n   [2578] The _D. G. of Shāhābād_ (pp. 20 and 127) mentions that\r\n   \"it is said Bābur marched to Ārrah after his victory over\r\n   Maḥmūd _Lūdī_\", and that \"local tradition still points to a\r\n   place near the Judge's Court as that on which he pitched his\r\n   camp\".\r\n\r\n   [2579] Kharīd which is now a _pargana_ of the Ballia district,\r\n   lay formerly on both sides of the Ghogrā. When the army of\r\n   Kharīd opposed Bābur's progress, it acted for Naṣrat Shāh, but\r\n   this Bābur diplomatically ignored in assuming that there was\r\n   peace between Bengal and himself.—At this time Naṣrat Shāh\r\n   held the riverain on the left bank of the Ghogrā but had lost\r\n   Kharīd of the right bank, which had been taken from him by\r\n   Jūnaid _Barlās_. A record of his occupation still survives in\r\n   Kharīd-town, an inscription dated by his deputy as for 1529\r\n   AD. (_District Gazetteer of Ballia_ H. R. Nevill), and _D. G.\r\n   of Sāran_ (L. L. S. O'Malley), Historical Chapters.\r\n\r\n   [2580] Bābur's opinion of Naṣrat Shāh's hostility is more\r\n   clearly shewn here than in the verbal message of f. 369.\r\n\r\n   [2581] This will be an unceremonious summary of a\r\n   word-of-mouth message.\r\n\r\n   [2582] Cf. f. 366_b_, p. 661 n. 2.\r\n\r\n   [2583] This shews that Bābur did not recognize the Sāran\r\n   riverain down to the Ganges as belonging to Kharīd. His\r\n   offered escort of Turks would safe-guard the Kharīdīs if they\r\n   returned to the right bank of the Ghogrā which was in Turk\r\n   possession.\r\n\r\n   [2584] The Ḥai. MS. has _wālī_, clearly written; which, as a\r\n   word representing Māhīm would suit the sentence best, may make\r\n   playful reference to her royal commands (f. 361_b_), by\r\n   styling her the Governor (_wālī_). Erskine read the word as a\r\n   place-name Dipālī, which I have not found; De Courteille omits\r\n   Ilminsky's _w:ras_ (p. 478). The MSS. vary and are uncertain.\r\n\r\n   [2585] This is the \"Kadjar\" of Réclus' _L'Asie antérieure_ and\r\n   is the name of the Turkmān tribe to which the present ruling\r\n   house of Persia belongs. \"Turkmān\" might be taken as applied\r\n   to Shāh T̤aḥmāsp by Dīv Sulṯān's servant on f. 354.\r\n\r\n   [2586] _Nelumbium speciosum_, a water-bean of great beauty.\r\n\r\n   [2587] Shaikh Yaḥyā had been the head of the Chishtī Order.\r\n   His son (d. 782 AH.-1380-1 AD.) was the author of works named\r\n   by Abū'l-faẓl as read aloud to Akbar, a discursive detail\r\n   which pleads in my excuse that those who know Bābur well\r\n   cannot but see in his grandson's character and success the\r\n   fruition of his mental characteristics and of his labours in\r\n   Hindūstān. (For Sharafu'd-dīn _Munīrī_, cf.\r\n   _Khazīnatu'l-asfiyā_ ii, 390-92; and _Āyīn-i-akbarī_ _s.n._)\r\n\r\n   [2588] Kostenko's _Turkistān Region_ describes a regimen for\r\n   horses which Bābur will have seen in practice in his native\r\n   land, one which prevented the defect that hindered his at\r\n   Munīr from accomplishing more than some 30 miles before\r\n   mid-day.\r\n\r\n   [2589] The distance from Munīr to the bank of the Ganges will\r\n   have been considerably longer in Bābur's day than now because\r\n   of the change of the river's course through its desertion of\r\n   the Burh-gangā channel (cf. next note).\r\n\r\n   [2590] In trying to locate the site of Bābur's coming battle\r\n   with the forces of Naṣrat Shāh, it should be kept in mind that\r\n   previous to the 18th century, and therefore, presumably, in\r\n   his day, the Ganges flowed in the \"Burh-ganga\" (Old Ganges)\r\n   channel which now is closely followed by the western boundary\r\n   of the Ballia _pargana_ of Dū-āba; that the Ganges and Ghogrā\r\n   will have met where this old channel entered the bed of the\r\n   latter river; and also, as is seen from Bābur's narrative,\r\n   that above the confluence the Ghogrā will have been confined\r\n   to a narrowed channel. When the Ganges flowed in the\r\n   Burh-ganga channel, the now Ballia _pargana_ of Dū-āba was a\r\n   sub-division of Bihiya and continuous with Shāhābād. From it\r\n   in Bihiya Bābur crossed the Ganges into Kharīd, doing this at\r\n   a place his narrative locates as some 2 miles from the\r\n   confluence. Cf. _D. G. of Ballia_, pp. 9, 192-3, 206, 213. It\r\n   may be observed that the former northward extension of Bihiya\r\n   to the Burh-ganga channel explains Bābur's estimate (f. 370)\r\n   of the distance from Munīr to his camp on the Ganges; his\r\n   12_k._ (24m.) may then have been correct; it is now too high.\r\n\r\n   [2591] De Courteille, _pierrier_, which may be a balista.\r\n   Bābur's writings give no indication of other than\r\n   stone-ammunition for any projectile-engine or fire-arm. Cf. R.\r\n   W. F. Payne-Gallwey's _Projectile-throwing engines of the\r\n   ancients_.\r\n\r\n   [2592] Sir R. W. F. Payne-Gallwey writes in _The Cross-bow_\r\n   (p. 40 and p. 41) what may apply to Bābur's _ẓarb-zan_\r\n   (culverin?) and _tufang_ (matchlock), when he describes the\r\n   larger culverin as a heavy hand-gun of from 16-18lb., as used\r\n   by the foot-soldier and requiring the assistance of an\r\n   attendant to work it; also when he says that it became the\r\n   portable arquebus which was in extensive use in Europe by the\r\n   Swiss in 1476 AD.; and that between 1510 and 1520 the arquebus\r\n   described was superseded by what is still seen amongst remote\r\n   tribes in India, a matchlock arquebus.\r\n\r\n   [2593] The two positions Bābur selected for his guns would\r\n   seem to have been opposite two ferry-heads, those, presumably,\r\n   which were blocked against his pursuit of Bīban and Bāyazīd.\r\n   `Alī-qulī's emplacement will have been on the high bank of old\r\n   alluvium of south-eastern Kharīd, overlooking the narrowed\r\n   channel demanded by Bābur's narrative, one pent in presumably\r\n   by _kankar_ reefs such as there are in the region. As\r\n   illustrating what the channel might have been, the varying\r\n   breadth of the Ghogrā along the `Azamgarh District may be\r\n   quoted, _viz._ from 10 miles to 2/5m., the latter being where,\r\n   as in Kharīd, there is old alluvium with _kankar_ reefs\r\n   preserving the banks. Cf. Reid's _Report of Settlement\r\n   Operations in `Azamgarh, Sikandarpur, and Bhadaon_.—Firishta\r\n   gives Badrū as the name of one ferry (lith. ed. i. 210).\r\n\r\n   [2594] Muṣṯafa, like `Alī-qulī, was to take the offensive by\r\n   gun-fire directed on the opposite bank. Judging from maps and\r\n   also from the course taken by the Ganges through the\r\n   Burh-ganga channel and from Bābur's narrative, there seems to\r\n   have been a narrow reach of the Ghogrā just below the\r\n   confluence, as well as above.\r\n\r\n   [2595] This ferry, bearing the common name Haldī (turmeric),\r\n   is located by the course of events as at no great distance\r\n   above the enemy's encampment above the confluence. It cannot\r\n   be the one of Sikandarpūr West.\r\n\r\n   [2596] _guẕr_, which here may mean a casual ford through water\r\n   low just before the Rains. As it was not found, it will have\r\n   been temporary.\r\n\r\n   [2597] _i.e._ above Bābur's positions.\r\n\r\n   [2598] _sarwar_ (or _dar_) _waqt_.\r\n\r\n   [2599] The preceding sentence is imperfect and varies in the\r\n   MSS. The 1st Pers. trs., the wording of which is often\r\n   explanatory, says that there were _no_ passages, which, as\r\n   there were many ferries, will mean fords. The Haldī-guẕr where\r\n   `Askarī was to cross, will have been far below the lowest\r\n   Bābur mentions, _viz._ Chatur-mūk (Chaupāra).\r\n\r\n   [2600] This passage presupposes that guns in Kharīd could hit\r\n   the hostile camp in Sāran. If the river narrowed here as it\r\n   does further north, the Ghāzī mortar, which seems to have been\r\n   the only one Bābur had with him, would have carried across,\r\n   since it threw a stone 1,600 paces (_qadam_, f. 309). Cf.\r\n   Reid's _Report_ quoted above.\r\n\r\n   [2601] Anglicé, Saturday after 6p.m.\r\n\r\n   [2602] _yaqīn būlghān fauj_, var. _ta`īn būlghān fauj_, the\r\n   army appointed (to cross). The boats will be those collected\r\n   at the Haldī-ferry, and the army `Askarī's.\r\n\r\n   [2603] _i.e._ near `Alī-qulī's emplacement.\r\n\r\n   [2604] Cf. f. 303, f. 309, f. 337 and n. 4.\r\n\r\n   [2605] \"The _yasāwal_ is an officer who carries the commands\r\n   of the prince, and sees them enforced\" (Erskine). Here he will\r\n   have been the superintendent of coolies moving earth.\r\n\r\n   [2606] _ma`jūn-nāk_ which, in these days of Bābur's return to\r\n   obedience, it may be right to translate in harmony with his\r\n   psychical outlook of self-reproach, by _ma`jūn_-polluted.\r\n   Though he had long ceased to drink wine, he still sought cheer\r\n   and comfort, in his laborious days, from inspiriting and\r\n   forbidden confections.\r\n\r\n   [2607] Probably owing to the less precise phrasing of his\r\n   Persian archetype, Erskine here has reversed the statement,\r\n   made in the Turkī, that Bābur slept in the Asāīsh (not the\r\n   Farmāīsh).\r\n\r\n   [2608] _aūstīdā tāshlār._ An earlier reading of this, _viz._\r\n   that stones were thrown on the intruder is negatived by\r\n   Bābur's mention of wood as the weapon used.\r\n\r\n   [2609] _sū sārī_ which, as the boats were between an island\r\n   and the river's bank, seems likely to mean that the man went\r\n   off towards the main stream. _Mems._ p. 415, \"made his escape\r\n   in the river\"; _Méms._ ii, 418, _dans la direction du large_.\r\n\r\n   [2610] This couplet is quoted by Jahāngīr also (_Tūzūk_, trs.\r\n   Rogers & Beveridge, i, 348).\r\n\r\n   [2611] This, taken with the positions of other\r\n   crossing-parties, serves to locate `Askarī's \"Haldī-passage\"\r\n   at no great distance above `Alī-qulī's emplacement at the\r\n   confluence, and above the main Bengal force.\r\n\r\n   [2612] perhaps, towed from the land. I have not found Bābur\r\n   using any word which clearly means to row, unless indeed a\r\n   later _rawān_ does so. The force meant to cross in the boats\r\n   taken up under cover of night was part of Bābur's own, no\r\n   doubt.\r\n\r\n   [2613] _ātīsh-bāzī_ lit. fire-playing, if a purely Persian\r\n   compound; if _ātīsh_ be Turkī, it means discharge, shooting.\r\n   The word \"fire-working\" is used above under the nearest to\r\n   contemporary guidance known to me, _viz._ that of the list of\r\n   persons who suffered in the Patna massacre \"during the\r\n   troubles of October 1763 AD.\", in which list are the names of\r\n   four Lieutenants fire-workers (_Calcutta Review_, Oct. 1884,\r\n   and Jan. 1885, art. _The Patna Massacre_, H. Beveridge).\r\n\r\n   [2614] _bī tahāshī_, without protest or demur.\r\n\r\n   [2615] Anglicé, Wednesday after 6 p.m.\r\n\r\n   [2616] Perhaps those which had failed to pass in the darkness;\r\n   perhaps those from Haldī-guẕr, which had been used by\r\n   `Askarī's troops. There appear to be obvious reasons for their\r\n   keeping abreast on the river with the troops in Sāran, in\r\n   order to convey reinforcements or to provide retreat.\r\n\r\n   [2617] _kīmalār aūstīdā_, which may mean that he came, on the\r\n   high bank, to where the boats lay below.\r\n\r\n   [2618] as in the previous note, _kīmalār aūstīdā_. These will\r\n   have been the few drawn up-stream along the enemy's front.\r\n\r\n   [2619] The reproach conveyed by Bābur's statement is borne out\r\n   by the strictures of Ḥaidar Mīrzā _Dūghlāt_ on Bābā Sulṯān's\r\n   neglect of duty (_Tārīkh-ī-rashīdī_ trs. cap. lxxvii).\r\n\r\n   [2620] _yūsūnlūq tūshī_, Pers. trss. _ṯarf khūd_, i.e. their\r\n   place in the array, a frequent phrase.\r\n\r\n   [2621] _dastak bīla dosta-i-qāmīsh bīla._ Cf. f. 363_b_ and f.\r\n   366_b_, for passages and notes connected with swimming and\r\n   _dastak_. Erskine twice translates _dastak bīla_ by swimming;\r\n   but here de Courteille changes from his earlier _à la nage_\r\n   (f. 366_b_) to _appuyés sur une pièce de bois_. Perhaps the\r\n   swift current was crossed by swimming with the support of a\r\n   bundle of reeds, perhaps on rafts made of such bundles (cf.\r\n   _Illustrated London News_, Sep. 16th, 1916, for a picture of\r\n   Indian soldiers so crossing on rafts).\r\n\r\n   [2622] perhaps they were in the Burh-ganga channel, out of\r\n   gun-fire.\r\n\r\n   [2623] If the Ghogrā flowed at this point in a narrow channel,\r\n   it would be the swifter, and less easy to cross than where in\r\n   an open bed.\r\n\r\n   [2624] _chīrīk-aīlī_, a frequent compound, but one of which\r\n   the use is better defined in the latter than the earlier part\r\n   of Bābur's writings to represent what then answered to an Army\r\n   Service Corps. This corps now crosses into Sāran and joins the\r\n   fighting force.\r\n\r\n   [2625] This appears to refer to the crossing effected before\r\n   the fight.\r\n\r\n   [2626] or Kūndbah. I have not succeeded in finding this name\r\n   in the Nirhun _pargana_; it may have been at the southern end,\r\n   near the \"Domaigarh\" of maps. In it was Tīr-mūhānī, perhaps a\r\n   village (f. 377, f. 381).\r\n\r\n   [2627] This passage justifies Erskine's surmise (_Memoirs_, p.\r\n   411, n. 4) that the Kharīd-country lay on both banks of the\r\n   Ghogrā. His further surmise that, on the east bank of the\r\n   Ghogrā, it extended to the Ganges would be correct also, since\r\n   the Ganges flowed, in Bābur's day, through the Burh-ganga (Old\r\n   Ganges) channel along the southern edge of the present Kharīd,\r\n   and thus joined the Ghogrā higher than it now does.\r\n\r\n   [2628] Bāyazīd and Ma`rūf _Farmūlī_ were brothers. Bāyazīd had\r\n   taken service with Bābur in 932 AH. (1526 AD.), left him in\r\n   934 AH. (end of 1527 AD.) and opposed him near Qanūj. Ma`rūf,\r\n   long a rebel against Ibrāhīm _Lūdī_, had never joined Bābur;\r\n   two of his sons did so; of the two, Muḥammad and Mūsa, the\r\n   latter may be the one mentioned as at Qanūj, \"Ma`rūf's son\"\r\n   (f. 336).—For an interesting sketch of Ma`rūf's character and\r\n   for the location in Hindūstān of the Farmūlī clan, _see_ the\r\n   _Wāqi`āt-i-mushtāqī_, E. & D.'s _History of India_, iv,\r\n   584.—In connection with Qanūj, the discursive remark may be\r\n   allowable, that Bābur's halt during the construction of the\r\n   bridge of boats across the Ganges in 934 AH. is still\r\n   commemorated by the name Bādshāh-nagar of a village between\r\n   Bangarmau and Nānāmau (Elliot's _Onau_, p. 45).\r\n\r\n   [2629] On f. 381 `Abdu'l-lāh's starting-place is mentioned as\r\n   Tīr-mūhānī.\r\n\r\n   [2630] The failure to join would be one of the evils predicted\r\n   by the dilatory start of the ladies from Kābul (f. 360_b_).\r\n\r\n   [2631] The order for these operations is given on f. 355_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2632] f. 369. The former Nūḥānī chiefs are now restored to\r\n   Bihār as tributaries of Bābur.\r\n\r\n   [2633] Erskine estimated the _krūr_ at about £25,000, and the\r\n   50 _laks_ at about £12,500.\r\n\r\n   [2634] The Mīrzā thus supersedes Junaid _Barlās_ in\r\n   Jūnpūr.—The form Jūnapūr used above and elsewhere by Bābur and\r\n   his Persian translators, supports the _Gazetteer of India_\r\n   xlv, 74 as to the origin of the name Jūnpūr.\r\n\r\n   [2635] a son of Naṣrat Shāh. No record of this earlier\r\n   legation is with the _Bābur-nāma_ manuscripts; probably it has\r\n   been lost. The only article found specified is the one asking\r\n   for the removal of the Kharīd army from a ferry-head Bābur\r\n   wished to use; Naṣrat Shāh's assent to this is an anti-climax\r\n   to Bābur's victory on the Ghogrā.\r\n\r\n   [2636] Chaupāra is at the Sāran end of the ferry, at the\r\n   Sikandarpūr one is Chatur-mūk (Four-faces, an epithet of\r\n   Brahma and Vishnu).\r\n\r\n   [2637] It may be inferred from the earlier use of the phrase\r\n   Gogar (or Gagar) and Sarū (Sīrū or Sīrd), on f. 338-8_b_, that\r\n   whereas the rebels were, earlier, for crossing Sarū only,\r\n   _i.e._ the Ghogrā below its confluence with the Sarda, they\r\n   had now changed for crossing above the confluence and further\r\n   north. Such a change is explicable by desire to avoid\r\n   encounter with Bābur's following, here perhaps the army of\r\n   Aūd, and the same desire is manifested by their abandonment of\r\n   a fort captured (f. 377_b_) some days before the rumour\r\n   reached Bābur of their crossing Sarū and Gogar.—Since\r\n   translating the passage on f. 338, I have been led, by\r\n   enforced attention to the movement of the confluence of Ghogrā\r\n   with Ganges (Sarū with Gang) to see that that translation,\r\n   eased in obedience to distances shewn in maps, may be wrong\r\n   and that Bābur's statement that he dismounted 2-3 _kurohs_\r\n   (4-6 m.) above Aūd at the confluence of Gogar with Sarū, may\r\n   have some geographical interest and indicate movement of the\r\n   two affluents such _e.g._ as is indicated of the Ganges and\r\n   Ghogrā by tradition and by the name Burh-ganga (cf. f. 370, p.\r\n   667, n. 2).\r\n\r\n   [2638] or L:knūr, perhaps Liknū or Liknūr. The capricious\r\n   variation in the MSS. between L:knū and L:knūr makes the\r\n   movements of the rebels difficult to follow. Comment on these\r\n   variants, tending to identify the places behind the words, is\r\n   grouped in Appendix T, _On L:knū_ (_Lakhnau_) and _L:knūr_\r\n   (_Lakhnār_).\r\n\r\n   [2639] Taking _guẕr_ in the sense it has had hitherto in the\r\n   _Bābur-nāma_ of ferry or ford, the detachment may have been\r\n   intended to block the river-crossings of \"Sarū and Gogar\". If\r\n   so, however, the time for this was past, the rebels having\r\n   taken a fort west of those rivers on Ramẓān 13th. Nothing\r\n   further is heard of the detachment.—That news of the\r\n   rebel-crossing of the rivers did not reach Bābur before the\r\n   18th and news of their capture of L:knū or L:knūr before the\r\n   19th may indicate that they had crossed a good deal to the\r\n   north of the confluence, and that the fort taken was one more\r\n   remote than Lakhnau (Oude). Cf. Appendix T.\r\n\r\n   [2640] Anglicé, Wednesday after 6 p.m.\r\n\r\n   [2641] These are recited late in the night during Ramẓān.\r\n\r\n   [2642] _kaghaẕ u ajzā'_, perhaps writing-paper and the various\r\n   sections of the _Bābur-nāma_ writings, _viz._ biographical\r\n   notices, descriptions of places, detached lengths of diary,\r\n   _farmāns_ of Shaikh Zain. The _lacunae_ of 934 AH., 935 AH.,\r\n   and perhaps earlier ones also may be attributed reasonably to\r\n   this storm. It is easy to understand the loss of _e.g._ the\r\n   conclusion of the Farghāna section, and the diary one of 934\r\n   AH., if they lay partly under water. The accident would be\r\n   better realized in its disastrous results to the writings, if\r\n   one knew whether Bābur wrote in a bound or unbound volume.\r\n   From the minor losses of 935 AH., one guesses that the current\r\n   diary at least had not reached the stage of binding.\r\n\r\n   [2643] The _tūnglūq_ is a flap in a tent-roof, allowing light\r\n   and air to enter, or smoke to come out.\r\n\r\n   [2644] _ajzā' u kitāb._ _See_ last note but one. The _kitāb_\r\n   (book) might well be Bābur's composed narrative on which he\r\n   was now working, as far as it had then gone towards its\r\n   untimely end (Ḥai. MS. f. 216_b_).\r\n\r\n   [2645] _saqarlāṯ kut-zīlūcha_, where _saqarlāṯ_ will mean warm\r\n   and woollen.\r\n\r\n   [2646] Kharīd-town is some 4 m. s.e. of the town of\r\n   Sikandarpūr.\r\n\r\n   [2647] or L:knū. Cf. Appendix T. It is now 14 days since\r\n   `Abdu'l-lāh _kitābdār_ had left Tīr-mūhānī (f. 380) for\r\n   Saṃbhal; as he was in haste, there had been time for him to go\r\n   beyond Aūd (where Bāqī was) and yet get the news to Bābur on\r\n   the 19th.\r\n\r\n   [2648] In a way not usual with him, Bābur seems to apply three\r\n   epithets to this follower, _viz._ _mīng-begī_, _shaghāwal_,\r\n   _Tāshkīndī_ (Index _s.n._).\r\n\r\n   [2649] or Kandla; cf. Revenue list f. 293; is it now Sāran\r\n   Khāṣ?\r\n\r\n   [2650] £18,000 (Erskine). For the total yield of Kundla (or\r\n   Kandla) and Sarwār, _see_ Revenue list (f. 293).\r\n\r\n   [2651] f. 375. P. 675 n. 2 and f. 381, p. 687 n. 3.\r\n\r\n   [2652] A little earlier Bābur has recorded his ease of mind\r\n   about Bihār and Bengal, the fruit doubtless of his victory\r\n   over Maḥmūd _Lūdī_ and Naṣrat Shāh; he now does the same about\r\n   Bihār and Sarwār, no doubt because he has replaced in Bihār,\r\n   as his tributaries, the Nūḥānī chiefs and has settled other\r\n   Afghāns, Jalwānīs and Farmūlīs in a Sarwār cleared of the\r\n   Jalwānī (?) rebel Bīban and the Farmūlī opponents Bāyazīd and\r\n   Ma`rūf. The Farmūlī Shaikh-zādas, it may be recalled, belonged\r\n   by descent to Bābur's Kābul district of Farmūl.—The\r\n   _Wāqi`āt-i-mushtāqī_ (E. & D.'s _H. of I._ iv, 548) details\r\n   the position of the clan under Sikandar _Lūdī_.\r\n\r\n   [2653] The MSS. write Fatḥpūr but Natḥpūr suits the context, a\r\n   _pargana_ mentioned in the _Āyīn-i-akbarī_ and now in the\r\n   `Azamgarh district. There seems to be no Fatḥpūr within\r\n   Bābur's limit of distance. The _D. G. of `Azamgarh_ mentions\r\n   two now insignificant Fatḥpūrs, one as having a school, the\r\n   other a market. The name G:l:r:h (K:l:r:h) I have not found.\r\n\r\n   [2654] The passage contained in this section seems to be a\r\n   survival of the lost record of 934 AH. (f. 339). I have found\r\n   it only in the _Memoirs_ p. 420, and in Mr. Erskine's own\r\n   Codex of the _Wāqi`āt-i-bāburī_ (now B.M. Add. 26,200), f. 371\r\n   where however several circumstances isolate it from the\r\n   context. It may be a Persian translation of an authentic Turkī\r\n   fragment, found, perhaps with other such fragments, in the\r\n   Royal Library. Its wording disassociates it from the\r\n   `Abdu'r-raḥīm text. The Codex (No. 26,200) breaks off at the\r\n   foot of a page (_supra_, Fatḥpūr) with a completed sentence.\r\n   The supposedly-misplaced passage is entered on the next folio\r\n   as a sort of ending of the _Bābur-nāma_ writings; in a rough\r\n   script, inferior to that of the Codex, and is followed by\r\n   _Tam, tam_ (Finis), and an incomplete date 98-, in words.\r\n   Beneath this a line is drawn, on which is subtended the\r\n   triangle frequent with scribes; within this is what seems to\r\n   be a completion of the date to 980 AH. and a pious wish,\r\n   scrawled in an even rougher hand than the rest.—Not only in\r\n   diction and in script but in contents also the passage is a\r\n   misfit where it now stands; it can hardly describe a village\r\n   on the Sarū; Bābur in 935 AH. did not march for Ghāzīpūr but\r\n   may have done so in 934 AH. (p. 656, n. 3); Ismā`īl _Jalwānī_\r\n   had had leave given already in 935 AH. (f. 377) under other\r\n   conditions, ones bespeaking more trust and tried\r\n   allegiance.—Possibly the place described as having fine\r\n   buildings, gardens _etc._ is Aūd (Ajodhya) where Bābur spent\r\n   some days in 934 AH. (cf. f. 363_b_, p. 655 n. 3).\r\n\r\n   [2655] \"Here my Persian manuscript closes\" (This is B.M. Add.\r\n   26,200). \"The two additional fragments are given from Mr.\r\n   Metcalfe's manuscript alone\" (now B.M. Add. 26,202) \"and\r\n   unluckily, it is extremely incorrect\" (Erskine). This note\r\n   will have been written perhaps a decade before 1826, in which\r\n   year the _Memoirs of Bābur_ was published, after long delay.\r\n   Mr. Erskine's own Codex (No. 26,200) was made good at a later\r\n   date, perhaps when he was working on his History of India\r\n   (pub. 1854), by a well-written supplement which carries the\r\n   diary to its usual end _s.a._ 936 AH. and also gives Persian\r\n   translations of Bābur's letters to Humāyūn and Khwāja Kalān.\r\n\r\n   [2656] Here, as earlier, Natḥpūr suits the context better than\r\n   Fatḥpūr. In the Natḥpūr _pargana_, at a distance from Chaupāra\r\n   approximately suiting Bābur's statement of distance, is the\r\n   lake \"Tal Ratoi\", formerly larger and deeper than now. There\r\n   is a second further west and now larger than Tal Ratoi;\r\n   through this the Ghogrā once flowed, and through it has tried\r\n   within the last half-century to break back. These changes in\r\n   Tal Ratoi and in the course of the Ghogrā dictate caution in\r\n   attempting to locate places which were on it in Bābur's day\r\n   _e.g._ K:l:r:h (_supra_).\r\n\r\n   [2657] Appendix T.\r\n\r\n   [2658] This name has the following variants in the Ḥai. MS.\r\n   and in Kehr's:—Dalm-ū-ūū-ūr-ūd-ūṯ. The place was in Akbar's\r\n   _sarkār_ of Mānikpūr and is now in the Rai Bareilly district.\r\n\r\n   [2659] Perhaps Chaksar, which was in Akbar's _sarkār_ of\r\n   Jūnpūr, and is now in the `Azamgarh district.\r\n\r\n   [2660] Ḥai. MS. _J:nāra khūnd tawābī sī bīla_ (perhaps\r\n   _tawābī`sī_ but not so written). The obscurity of these words\r\n   is indicated by their variation in the manuscripts. Most\r\n   scribes have them as Chunār and Jūnpūr, guided presumably by\r\n   the despatch of a force to Chunār on receipt of the news, but\r\n   another force was sent to Dalmau at the same time. The rebels\r\n   were defeated s.w. of Dalmau and thence went to Mahūba; it is\r\n   not certain that they had crossed the Ganges at Dalmau; there\r\n   are difficulties in supposing the fort they captured and\r\n   abandoned was Lakhnau (Oude); they might have gone south to\r\n   near Kālpī and Ādampūr, which are at no great distance from\r\n   where they were defeated by Bāqī _shaghāwal_, if Lakhnūr (now\r\n   Shahābād in Rāmpūr) were the fort. (Cf. Appendix T.)—To take\r\n   up the interpretation of the words quoted above, at another\r\n   point, that of the kinsfolk or fellow-Afghāns the rebels\r\n   planned to join:—these kinsfolk may have been, of Bāyazīd, the\r\n   Farmūlīs in Sarwār, and of Bīban, the Jalwānīs of the same\r\n   place. The two may have trusted to relationship for harbourage\r\n   during the Rains, disloyal though they were to their kinsmen's\r\n   accepted suzerain. Therefore if they were once across Ganges\r\n   and Jumna, as they were in Mahūba, they may have thought of\r\n   working eastwards south of the Ganges and of getting north\r\n   into Sarwār through territory belonging to the Chunār and\r\n   Jūnpūr governments. This however is not expressed by the words\r\n   quoted above; perhaps Bābur's record was hastily and\r\n   incompletely written.—Another reading may be Chunār and Jaund\r\n   (in Akbar's _sarkār_ of Rohtās).\r\n\r\n   [2661] _yūlīinī tūshqāīlār._ It may be observed concerning the\r\n   despatch of Muḥammad-i-zamān M. and of Junaid _Barlās_ that\r\n   they went to their new appointments Jūnpūr and Chunār\r\n   respectively; that their doing so was an orderly part of the\r\n   winding-up of Bābur's Eastern operations; that they remained\r\n   as part of the Eastern garrison, on duty apart from that of\r\n   blocking the road of Bīban and Bāyazīd.\r\n\r\n   [2662] This mode of fishing is still practised in India\r\n   (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [2663] Islāmicé, Saturday night; Anglicé, Friday after 6 p.m.\r\n\r\n   [2664] This Tūs, \"Tousin, or Tons, is a branch from the Ghogrā\r\n   coming off above Faizābād and joining the Sarju or Parsarū\r\n   below `Azamgarh\" (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [2665] Kehr's MS. p. 1132, Māng (or Mānk); Ḥai.

This exploit\r\n   serves to show that three years of continuous activity in the\r\n   plains of Hindūstān had not destroyed Bābur's capacity for\r\n   sustained effort, spite of several attacks of (malarial?)\r\n   fever.\r\n\r\n   [2677] Anglicé, Tuesday 12.25 a.m.\r\n\r\n   [2678] He was governor of Etāwa.\r\n\r\n   [2679] Islamicé, Friday, Shawwāl 18th, Anglicé, Thursday, June\r\n   24th, soon after 9 p.m.\r\n\r\n   [2680] Anglicé, she arrived at mid-night of\r\n   Saturday.—Gul-badan writes of Māhīm's arrival as unexpected\r\n   and of Bābur's hurrying off on foot to meet her\r\n   (_Humāyūn-nāma_ f. 14, trs. p. 100).\r\n\r\n   [2681] Māhīm's journey from Kābul to Āgra had occupied over 5\r\n   months.\r\n\r\n   [2682] Hindū Beg _qūchīn_ had been made Humāyūn's retainer in\r\n   932 AH. (f. 297), and had taken possession of Saṃbhal for him.\r\n   Hence, as it seems, he was ordered, while escorting the ladies\r\n   from Kābul, to go to Saṃbhal. He seems to have gone before\r\n   waiting on Bābur, probably not coming into Āgra till now.—It\r\n   may be noted here that in 933 AH. he transformed a Hindū\r\n   temple into a Mosque in Saṃbhal; it was done by Bābur's orders\r\n   and is commemorated by an inscription still existing on the\r\n   Mosque, one seeming not to be of his own composition, judging\r\n   by its praise of himself. (JASB. _Proceedings_, May 1873, p.\r\n   98, Blochmann's art. where the inscription is given and\r\n   translated; and _Archæological Survey Reports_, xii, p. 24-27,\r\n   with Plates showing the Mosque).\r\n\r\n   [2683] Cf. f. 375, f. 377, with notes concerning `Abdu'l-lāh\r\n   and Tīr-mūhānī. I have not found the name Tīr-mūhānī on maps;\r\n   its position can be inferred from Bābur's statement (f. 375)\r\n   that he had sent `Abdu'l-lāh to Saṃbhal, he being then at\r\n   Kunba or Kunīa in the Nurhun _pargana_.—The name Tīr-mūhānī\r\n   occurs also in Gorakhpūr.—It was at Tīr-mūhānī (Three-mouths)\r\n   that Khwānd-amīr completed the _Ḥabībū's-siyar_ (lith. ed. i,\r\n   83; Rieu's _Pers.

Add. 16, 709, p. 18)\r\n   supplements the fragmentary accounts which, above and _s.a._\r\n   936 AH., are all that the _Bābur-nāma_ now preserves\r\n   concerning Khwāja Rāḥīm-dād's misconduct. It has several\r\n   mistakes but the gist of its information is useful. It\r\n   mentions that the Khwāja and his paternal-uncle Mahdī Khwāja\r\n   had displeased Bābur; that Raḥīm-dād resolved to take refuge\r\n   with the ruler of Mālwā (Muḥammad _Khīljī_) and to make over\r\n   Gūālīār to a Rājpūt landholder of that country; that upon this\r\n   Shaikh Muḥammad _Ghaus̤_ went to Āgra and interceded with\r\n   Bābur and obtained his forgiveness for Raḥīm-dād. Gūālīār was\r\n   given back to Raḥīm-dād but after a time he was superseded by\r\n   Abū'l-fatḥ [Shaikh Gūran]. For particulars about Mahdī Khwāja\r\n   and a singular story told about him by Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad in\r\n   the _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_, _vide_ Gul-badan's _Ḥumāyūn-nāma_,\r\n   Appendix B, and _Translator's Note_ p. 702, Section _f_.\r\n\r\n   [2686] He may have come about the misconduct of his nephew\r\n   Raḥīm-dād.\r\n\r\n   [2687] The `Īdu'l-kabīr, the Great Festival of 10th\r\n   Ẕū'l-ḥijja.\r\n\r\n   [2688] About £1750 (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [2689] Perhaps he was from the tract in Persia still called\r\n   Chaghatāī Mountains. One Ibrāhīm _Chaghatāī_ is mentioned by\r\n   Bābur (f. 175b) with Turkmān begs who joined Ḥusain\r\n   _Bāī-qarā_. This Ḥasan-i-`alī _Chaghatāī_ may have come in\r\n   like manner, with Murād the Turkmān envoy from `Irāq (f. 369\r\n   and n. 1).\r\n\r\n   [2690] Several incidents recorded by Gul-badan (writing half a\r\n   century later) as following Māhīm's arrival in Āgra, will\r\n   belong to the record of 935 AH. because they preceded\r\n   Humāyūn's arrival from Badakhshān. Their omission from Bābur's\r\n   diary is explicable by its minor _lacunæ_. Such are:—(1) a\r\n   visit to Dhūlpūr and Sīkrī the interest of which lies in its\r\n   showing that Bībī Mubārika had accompanied Māhīm Begīm to Āgra\r\n   from Kābul, and that there was in Sīkrī a quiet retreat, a\r\n   _chaukandī_, where Bābur \"used to write his book\";—(2) the\r\n   arrival of the main caravan of ladies from Kābul, which led\r\n   Bābur to go four miles out, to Naugrām, in order to give\r\n   honouring reception to his sister Khān-ẓāda Begīm;—(3) an\r\n   excursion to the Gold-scattering garden (_Bāgh-i-zar-afshān_),\r\n   where seated among his own people, Bābur said he was \"bowed\r\n   down by ruling and reigning\", longed to retire to that garden\r\n   with a single attendant, and wished to make over his\r\n   sovereignty to Humāyūn;—(4) the death of Dil-dār's son Alwār\r\n   (var. Anwār) whose birth may be assigned to the gap preceding\r\n   932 AH. because not chronicled later by Bābur, as is Farūq's.\r\n   As a distraction from the sorrow for this loss, a journey was\r\n   \"pleasantly made by water\" to Dhūlpūr.\r\n\r\n   [2691] Cf. f. 381b n. 2. For his earlier help to Raḥīm-dād\r\n   _see_ f. 304. For Biographies of him _see_ Blochmann's A.-i-A.\r\n   trs. p. 446, and Badāyūnī's _Muntakhabu-'t-tawārīkh_\r\n   (Ranking's and Lowe's trss.).\r\n\r\n   [2692] Beyond this broken passage, one presumably at the foot\r\n   of a page in Bābur's own manuscript, nothing of his diary is\r\n   now known to survive. What is missing seems likely to have\r\n   been written and lost. It is known from a remark of\r\n   Gul-badan's (H.N. p. 103) that he \"used to write his book\"\r\n   after Māhīm's arrival in Āgra, the place coming into her\r\n   anecdote being Sīkrī.\r\n\r\n   [2693] Jauhar's _Humāyūn-nāma_ and Bāyazīd _Bīyāt's_ work of\r\n   the same title were written under the same royal command as\r\n   the Begīm's. They contribute nothing towards filling the gap\r\n   of 936 AH.; their authors, being Humāyūn's servants, write\r\n   about him. It may be observed that criticism of these books,\r\n   as recording trivialities, is disarmed if they were commanded\r\n   because they would obey an order to set down whatever was\r\n   known, selection amongst their contents resting with\r\n   Abū'l-faẓl. Even more completely must they be excluded from a\r\n   verdict on the literary standard of their day.—Abū'l-faẓl must\r\n   have had a source of Bāburiana which has not found its way\r\n   into European libraries. A man likely to have contributed his\r\n   recollections, directly or transmitted, is Khwāja Muqīm\r\n   _Harāwī_. The date of Muqīm's death is conjectural only, but\r\n   he lived long enough to impress the worth of historical\r\n   writing on his son Niẕāmu'-d-dīn Aḥmad. (Cf. E. and D.'s H. of\r\n   I. art. _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_ v, 177 and 187; T̤.-i-A. lith. ed.\r\n   p. 193; and for Bāyazīd _Bīyāt's_ work, JASB. 1898, p. 296.)\r\n\r\n   [2694] Ibn Batuta (Lee's trs. p. 133) mentions that after his\r\n   appointment to Gūālīār, Raḥīm-dād fell from favour ... but was\r\n   restored later, on the representation of Muḥammad Ghaus̤; held\r\n   Gūālīār again for a short time, (he went to Bahādur Shāh in\r\n   Gujrāt) and was succeeded by Abū'l-fatḥ (_i.e._ Shaikh Gūran)\r\n   who held it till Bābur's death.\r\n\r\n   [2695] Its translation and explanatory noting have filled two\r\n   decades of hard-working years. _Tanti labores auctoris et\r\n   traductoris!_\r\n\r\n   [2696] I am indebted to my husband for acquaintance with\r\n   Niẕāmu'-d-dīn Aḥmad's record about Bābur and Kashmīr.\r\n\r\n   [2697] In view of the vicissitudes to which under Humāyūn the\r\n   royal library was subjected, it would be difficult to assert\r\n   that this source was not the missing continuation of Bābur's\r\n   diary.\r\n\r\n   [2698] E. and D.'s H. of I. art. _Tārīkh-i Khān-i-jahān Lūdī_\r\n   v, 67. For Aḥmad-i-yādgār's book and its special features\r\n   _vide_ _l.c._ v, 2, 24, with notes; Rieu's _Persian Catalogue_\r\n   iii, 922_a_; JASB. 1916, H. Beveridge's art. _Note on the\r\n   Tārīkh-i-salāṯīn-i-afāghana._\r\n\r\n   [2699] Humāyūn's last recorded act in Hindūstān was that of\r\n   933 AH. (f. 329_b_) when he took unauthorized possession of\r\n   treasure in Dihlī.\r\n\r\n   [2700] _Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_ trs. p. 387.\r\n\r\n   [2701] T.-i-R. trs. p. 353 _et seq._ and Mr. Ney Elias' notes.\r\n\r\n   [2702] Abū'l-faẓl's record of Humāyūn's sayings and minor\r\n   doings at this early date in his career, can hardly be\r\n   anything more accurate than family-tradition.\r\n\r\n   [2703] The statement that Khalīfa was asked to go so far from\r\n   where he was of the first importance as an administrator,\r\n   leads to consideration of why it was done. So little is known\r\n   explicitly of Bābur's intentions about his territories after\r\n   his death that it is possible only to put that little together\r\n   and read between its lines. It may be that he was now planning\r\n   an immediate retirement to Kābul and an apportionment during\r\n   life of his dominions, such as Abū-sa`īd had made of his own.\r\n   If so, it would be desirable to have Badakhshān held in\r\n   strength such as Khalīfa's family could command, and\r\n   especially desirable because as Barlās Turks, that family\r\n   would be one with Bābur in desire to regain Transoxiana. Such\r\n   a political motive would worthily explain the offer of the\r\n   appointment.\r\n\r\n   [2704] The \"Shāh\" of this style is derived from Sulaimān's\r\n   Badakhshī descent through Shāh Begīm; the \"Mīrzā\" from his\r\n   Mīrān-shāhī descent through his father Wais Khān Mīrzā. The\r\n   title Khān Mīrzā or Mīrzā Khān, presumably according to the\r\n   outlook of the speaker, was similarly derived from forbears,\r\n   as would be also Shāh Begīm's; (her personal name is not\r\n   mentioned in the sources).\r\n\r\n   [2705] Sa`īd, on the father's, and Bābur, on the mother's\r\n   side, were of the same generation in descent from Yūnas Khān;\r\n   Sulaimān was of a younger one, hence his pseudo-filial\r\n   relation to the men of the elder one.\r\n\r\n   [2706] Sa`īd was Shāh Begīm's grandson through her son Aḥmad,\r\n   Sulaimān her great-grandson through her daughter Sulṯān-Nigār,\r\n   but Sulaimān could claim also as the heir of his father who\r\n   was nominated to rule by Shāh Begīm; moreover, he could claim\r\n   by right of conquest on the father's side, through Abū-sa`īd\r\n   the conqueror, his son Maḥmūd long the ruler, and so through\r\n   Maḥmūd's son Wais Khān Mīrzā.\r\n\r\n   [2707] The menace conveyed by these words would be made the\r\n   more forceful by Bābur's move to Lāhor, narrated by\r\n   Aḥmad-i-yādgār. Some ill-result to Sa`īd of independent rule\r\n   by Sulaimān seems foreshadowed; was it that if Bābur's\r\n   restraining hand were withdrawn, the Badakhshīs would try to\r\n   regain their lost districts and would have help in so-doing\r\n   from Bābur?\r\n\r\n   [2708] It is open to conjecture that if affairs in Hindūstān\r\n   had allowed it, Bābur would now have returned to Kābul.\r\n   Aḥmad-i-yādgār makes the expedition to be one for pleasure\r\n   only, and describes Bābur as hunting and sight-seeing for a\r\n   year in Lāhor, the Panj-āb and near Dihlī. This appears a mere\r\n   flourish of words, in view of the purposes the expedition\r\n   served, and of the difficulties which had arisen in Lāhor\r\n   itself and with Sa`īd Khān. Part of the work effected may have\r\n   been the despatch of an expedition to Kashmīr.\r\n\r\n   [2709] This appears a large amount.\r\n\r\n   [2710] The precision with which the Rāja's gifts are stated,\r\n   points to a closely-contemporary and written source. A second\r\n   such indication occurs later where gifts made to Hind-āl are\r\n   mentioned.\r\n\r\n   [2711] An account of the events in Multān after its occupation\r\n   by Shāh Ḥasan _Arghūn_ is found in the latter part of the\r\n   _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_ and in Erskine's H. of I. i, 393 _et\r\n   seq._—It may be noted here that several instances of confusion\r\n   amongst Bābur's sons occur in the extracts made by Sir H.\r\n   Elliot and Professor Dowson in their _History of India_ from\r\n   the less authoritative sources [_e.g._ v, 35 Kāmrān for\r\n   Humāyūn, `Askarī said to be in Kābul (pp. 36 and 37); Hind-āl\r\n   for Humāyūn _etc._] and that these errors have slipped into\r\n   several of the District Gazetteers of the United Provinces.\r\n\r\n   [2712] As was said of the offering made by the Rāja of Kahlūr,\r\n   the precision of statement as to what was given to Hind-āl,\r\n   bespeaks a closely-contemporary written source. So too does\r\n   the mention (text, _infra_) of the day on which Bābur began\r\n   his return journey from Lāhor.\r\n\r\n   [2713] Cf. _G. of I._ xvi, 55; Ibbetson's _Report on Karnāl_.\r\n\r\n   [2714] It is noticeable that no one of the three royal\r\n   officers named as sent against Mohan _Mundāhir_, is\r\n   recognizable as mentioned in the _Bābur-nāma_. They may all\r\n   have had local commands, and not have served further east.\r\n   Perhaps this, their first appearance, points to the origin of\r\n   the information as independent of Bābur, but he might have\r\n   been found to name them, if his diary were complete for 936\r\n   AH.\r\n\r\n   [2715] The E. and D. translation writes twice as though the\r\n   inability to \"pull\" the bows were due to feebleness in the\r\n   men, but an appropriate reading would refer the difficulty to\r\n   the hardening of sinews in the composite Turkish bows, which\r\n   prevented the archers from bending the bows for stringing.\r\n\r\n   [2716] One infers that fires were burned all night in the\r\n   bivouac.\r\n\r\n   [2717] At this point the A.S.B. copy (No. 137) of the\r\n   _Tārīkh-i-salāṯin-i-afāghana_ has a remark which may have been\r\n   a marginal note originally, and which cannot be supposed made\r\n   by Aḥmad-i-yādgār himself because this would allot him too\r\n   long a spell of life. It may show however that the\r\n   interpolations about the two Tīmūrids were not inserted in his\r\n   book by him. Its purport is that the Mundāhir village\r\n   destroyed by Bābur's troops in 936 AH.-1530 AD. was still in\r\n   ruins at the time it was written 160 (lunar) years later\r\n   (_i.e._ in 1096 AH.-1684-85 AD.). The better Codex (No. 3887)\r\n   of the Imperial Library of Calcutta has the same passage.—Both\r\n   that remark and its context show acquaintance with Samāna and\r\n   Kaithal.—The writings now grouped under the title\r\n   _Tārīkh-i-salāṯīn-i-afāghana_ present difficulties both as to\r\n   date and contents (cf. Rieu's _Persian Catalogue_ _s. n._).\r\n\r\n   [2718] Presumably in Tihrind.\r\n\r\n   [2719] Cf. G. B.'s H. N. trs. and the _Akbar-nāma_ Bib. Ind.\r\n   ed. and trs., Index _s.nn._; Hughes' _Dictionary of Islām_\r\n   _s.n._ Intercession.\r\n\r\n   [2720] A closer translation would be, \"I have taken up the\r\n   burden.\" The verb is _bardāshtan_ (cf. f. 349, p. 626 n. 1).\r\n\r\n   [2721] _See_ Erskine's _History of India_ ii, 9.\r\n\r\n   [2722] At this point attention is asked to the value of the\r\n   Aḥmad-i-yādgār interpolation which allows Bābur a year of\r\n   active life before Humāyūn's illness and his own which\r\n   followed. With no chronicle known of 936 AH. Bābur had been\r\n   supposed ill all through the year, a supposition which\r\n   destroys the worth of his self-sacrifice. Moreover several\r\n   inferences have been drawn from the supposed year of illness\r\n   which are disproved by the activities recorded in that\r\n   interpolation.\r\n\r\n   [2723] E. and D.'s _History of India_ v, 187; G.

(f. 339_b_).\r\n   The inscription gives two chronograms of Khusrau's death (725\r\n   AH.), mentions that Mahdī Khwāja was the creator of the\r\n   memorial, and gives its date in the words, \"The beautiful\r\n   effort of Mahdī Khwāja.\"—The Dihlī ed. of the\r\n   _As̤ār-i-ṣanādīd_ depicts the slab with its inscription; the\r\n   Lakhnau ed. depicts the tomb, may show the slab _in sitû_, and\r\n   contains interesting matter by Sayyid Aḥmad Khān. The slab is\r\n   mentioned without particulars in Murray's _Hand-book to\r\n   Bengal_, p. 329.\r\n\r\n   [2729] Lee's _Ibn Batuta_ p. 133 and Hirāman's\r\n   _Tārīkh-i-gūālīārī_. Cf. G. B.'s _Humāyūn-nāma_ trs.

This was 29 years before the story calls him a young man.\r\n   Even if the word _jawān_ (young man) be read, as T. _yīgīt_ is\r\n   frequently to be read, in the sense of \"efficient fighting\r\n   man\", Mahdī was over-age. Other details of the story, besides\r\n   the word _jawān_, bespeak a younger man.\r\n\r\n   [2731] G. B.'s H. N. trs. p. 126; _Ḥabību's-siyar_, B. M. Add.\r\n   16,679 f. 370, l. 16, lith. ed. Sec.

Cf. references of penultimate note.\r\n\r\n   [2735] It attaches interest to the Mīrzā that he can be taken\r\n   reasonably as once the owner of the Elphinstone Codex (cf.\r\n   JRAS. 1907, pp. 136 and 137).\r\n\r\n   [2736] Death did not threaten when this gift was made; life in\r\n   Kābul was planned for.—Here attention is asked again to the\r\n   value of Aḥmad-i-yādgār's Bāburiana for removing the\r\n   impression set on many writers by the blank year 936 AH. that\r\n   it was one of illness, instead of being one of travel, hunting\r\n   and sight-seeing. The details of the activities of that year\r\n   have the further value that they enhance the worth of Bābur's\r\n   sacrifice of life.—Ḥaidar Mīrzā also fixes the date of the\r\n   beginning of illness as 937 AH.\r\n\r\n   [2737] The author, or embroiderer, of that anonymous story did\r\n   not know the _Bābur-nāma_ well, or he would not have described\r\n   Bābur as a wine-drinker after 933 AH. The anecdote is parallel\r\n   with Niẕāmu'd-dīn Aḥmad's, the one explaining why the Mīrzā\r\n   was selected, the other why the _dāmād_ was dropped.\r\n\r\n   [2738] _Bib.

It is unlikely that the town had come down to having\r\n   a single exit; the Gate by which he got out of Akhsī was the\r\n   one of military importance because served by a draw-bridge,\r\n   presumably over the ravine-moat, and perhaps not close to that\r\n   bridge.\r\n\r\n   [2754] For mention of upper villages _see_ f. 110 and note 1.\r\n\r\n   [2755] _Cf._ f. 114 for distances which would be useful in\r\n   locating Akhsī if Bābur's _yīghāch_ were not variable; Ritter,\r\n   vii, 3 and 733; Réclus, vi, index _s.n._ Farghāna; Ujfalvy ii,\r\n   168, his quotation from Yāqūt and his authorities; Nalivkine's\r\n   _Histoire du Khanat de Kokand_, p. 14 and p. 53; Schuyler, i,\r\n   324; Kostenko, Tables of Contents for cognate general\r\n   information and i, 320, for Tāshkīnt; von Schwarz, index under\r\n   related names, and especially p. 345 and plates; Pumpelly, p.\r\n   18 and p. 115.\r\n\r\n   [2756] This Turkī-Persian Dictionary was compiled by Mīrzā\r\n   Mahdī Khān.

(1655 AD.) mentions\r\n   the existence of lacunæ in a copy of the Bābur-nāma, in the\r\n   Imperial Library and allowed by his wording to be Bābur's\r\n   autograph MS.

The reference is to the Ghoswāra inscription, of\r\n   which Professor Kielhorn has also written (_Indian Antiquary_,\r\n   1888), but with departure from Nangarahāra to Nagarahāra.\r\n\r\n   [2775] The scribe of the Ḥaidarābād Codex appears to have been\r\n   somewhat uncertain as to the spelling of the name. What is\r\n   found in histories is plain, N:g:r:hār. The other name varies;\r\n   on first appearance (fol. 131_b_) and also on fols. 144 and\r\n   154_b_, there is a vagrant dot below the word, which if it\r\n   were above would make Nīng-nahār. In all other cases the word\r\n   reads N:g:nahār. Nahār is a constant component, as is also the\r\n   letter _g_(or _k_).\r\n\r\n   [2776] Some writers express the view that the medial _r_ in\r\n   this word indicates descent from Nagarahāra, and that the\r\n   medial _n_ of Elphinstone's second form is a corruption of it.\r\n   Though this might be, it is true also that in local speech _r_\r\n   and _n_ often interchange, _e.g._ Chighār- and Chighān-sarāī,\r\n   Sūhār and Sūhān (in Nūr-valley).\r\n\r\n   [2777] This asserts _n_ to be the correct consonant, and\r\n   connects with the interchange of _n_ and _r_ already noted.\r\n\r\n   [2778] Since writing the above I have seen Laidlaw's almost\r\n   identical suggestion of a nasal interpolated in Nagarahāra\r\n   (JASB. 1848, art. on Kittoe). The change is of course found\r\n   elsewhere; is not Tānk for Tāq an instance?\r\n\r\n   [2779] These affluents I omit from main consideration as\r\n   sponsors because they are less obvious units of taxable land\r\n   than the direct affluents of the Kābul-river, but they remain\r\n   a reserve force of argument and may or may not have counted in\r\n   Bābur's nine.\r\n\r\n   [2780] Cunningham, i, 42. My topic does not reach across the\r\n   Kābul-river to the greater Udyānapūra of Beal's _Buddhist\r\n   Records_ (p. 119) nor raise the question of the extent of that\r\n   place.\r\n\r\n   [2781] The strong form Nīng-nahār is due to euphonic impulse.\r\n\r\n   [2782] Some discussion about these coins has already appeared\r\n   in JRAS. 1913 and 1914 from Dr. Codrington, Mr. M. Longworth\r\n   Dames and my husband.\r\n\r\n   [2783] This variant from the Turkī may be significant. Should\r\n   _tamghānat(-i-)sikka_ be read and does this describe\r\n   countermarking?\r\n\r\n   [2784] It will be observed that Bābur does not explicitly say\r\n   that Ḥusain put the beg's name on the coin.\r\n\r\n   [2785] _Ḥabību's-siyar_ lith. ed. iii, 228; _Ḥaidarābād_ Codex\r\n   text and trs. f. 26_b_ and f. 169; Browne's Daulat Shāh p.\r\n   533.\r\n\r\n   [2786] Ḥusain born 842 AH. (1438 AD.); d. 911 AH. (1506 AD.).\r\n\r\n   [2787] Cf. f. 7_b_ note to braves (_yīgītlār_). There may be\r\n   instances, in the earlier Farghāna section where I have\r\n   translated _chuhra_ wrongly by _page_. My attention had not\r\n   then been fixed on the passage about the coins, nor had I the\r\n   same familiarity with the Kābul section. For a household page\r\n   to be clearly recognizable as such from the context, is\r\n   rare—other uses of the word are translated as their context\r\n   dictates.\r\n\r\n   [2788] They can be traced through my Index and in some cases\r\n   their careers followed. Since I translated _chuhra-jīrga-si_\r\n   on f. 15_b_ by cadet-corps, I have found in the Kābul section\r\n   instances of long service in the corps which make the word\r\n   cadet, as it is used in English, too young a name.\r\n\r\n   [2789] This Mr. M. Longworth Dames pointed out in JRAS. 1913.\r\n\r\n   [2790] _Habību's-siyar_ lith. ed. iii, 219; Ferté trs. p. 28.\r\n   For the information about Ḥusain's coins given in this\r\n   appendix I am indebted to Dr. Codrington and Mr. M.

It lay 3 m. west of the present\r\n   Qandahār (not its immediate successor). It must be observed\r\n   that Darmesteter's insufficient help in plans and maps led him\r\n   to identify Chihil-zīna with Chihil-dukhtarān\r\n   (Forty-daughters).\r\n\r\n   [2795] _Tārīkh-i-rashīdī_ trs. p. 387; _Akbar-nāma_ trs. i,\r\n   290.\r\n\r\n   [2796] Ḥai.

The above names of his\r\n   brother and sister are given elsewhere only by Gulbadan (f.\r\n   6_b_).\r\n\r\n   [2801] The \"we\" might be Māhīm and Humāyūn, to Bābur in camp.\r\n\r\n   [2802] Perhaps before announcing the birth anywhere.\r\n\r\n   [2803] Presumably this plural is honorific for the Honoured\r\n   Mother Māhīm.\r\n\r\n   [2804] Māhīm's and Humāyūn's quarters.\r\n\r\n   [2805] Gul-badan's _Humāyūn-nāma_, f. 8.\r\n\r\n   [2806] JRAS.

Thus _Firdaus-makān_\r\n   (dweller-in-paradise) is Bābur's; Humāyūn's is\r\n   _Jannat-ashi-yānī_, he whose nest is in Heaven; Muḥammad\r\n   Shāh's _Firdaus-āramgāh_, he whose place of rest is Paradise;\r\n   _etc._ (Erskine).\r\n\r\n   [2815] Here Mr. Erskine notes, \"Literally, _nectar-fruit_,\r\n   probably the mandarin orange, by the natives called _nāringī_.\r\n   The name _amrat_, or pear, in India is applied to the guava or\r\n   _Psidium pyriferum_—(_Spondias mangifera_, Hort. Ben.—D.\r\n   Wallich).\"... Mr. E. notes also that the note on the\r\n   _amrit-phal_ \"is not found in either of the Persian\r\n   translations\".\r\n\r\n   [2816] _chūchūmān_, Pers. trs. _shīrīni bī maza_, perhaps\r\n   flat, sweet without relish. Bābur does not use the word, nor\r\n   have I traced it in a dictionary.\r\n\r\n   [2817] _chūchūk_, savoury, nice-tasting, not acid (Shaw).\r\n\r\n   [2818] _chūchūk nāranj āndāq (?) maṯ`ūn aīdī kīm har kīm-nī\r\n   shīrīn-kārlīghī bī masa qīlkāndī, nāranj-sū'ī dīk tūr dīrlār\r\n   aīdī._\r\n\r\n   [2819] The _lemu_ may be _Citrus limona_, which has abundant\r\n   juice of a mild acid flavour.\r\n\r\n   [2820] The _kāmila_ and _samṯara_ are the real oranges\r\n   (_kauṅlā_ and _sangtāra_), which are now (_cir._ 1816 AD.)\r\n   common all over India. Dr. Hunter conjectures that the\r\n   _sangtāra_ may take its name from Cintra, in Portugal. This\r\n   early mention of it by Bābur and Humāyūn may be considered as\r\n   subversive of that supposition. (This description of the\r\n   _samṯara_, vague as it is, applies closer to the _Citrus\r\n   decumana_ or _pampelmus_, than to any other.—D.\r\n   Wallich.)—Erskine.\r\n\r\n   [2821] Humāyūn writes of this fruit as though it were not the\r\n   _sang-tara_ described by his father on f. 287 (p. 511 and\r\n   note).\r\n\r\n   [2822] M. de Courteille translated _jama`_ in a general sense\r\n   by _totalit.'_ instead of in its Indian technical one of\r\n   revenue (as here) or of assessment. Hence Professor Dowson's\r\n   \"totality\" (iv, 262 n.).\r\n\r\n   [2823] The B.M. has a third copy, Or. 5879, which my husband\r\n   estimates as of little importance.\r\n\r\n   [2824] Sir G. A. Grierson, writing in the _Indian Antiquary_\r\n   (July 1885, p. 187), makes certain changes in Ajodhya Prasad's\r\n   list of the Brahman rulers of Tirhut, on grounds he states.\r\n\r\n   [2825] Index _s.n._ Bābur's letters. The passage Shaikh Zain\r\n   quotes is found in Or. 1999, f. 65_b_, Add. 26,202, f. 66_b_,\r\n   Or. 5879, f. 79_b_.\r\n\r\n   [2826] Cf. Index _in loco_ for references to Bābur's metrical\r\n   work, and for the Facsimile, JASB. 1910, Extra Number.\r\n\r\n   [2827] Monday, Rabi` II. 15th 935 AH.—Dec. 27th 1528 AD. At\r\n   this date Bābur had just returned from Dhūlpūr to Āgra (f.\r\n   354, p. 635, where in note 1 for Thursday read Monday).\r\n\r\n   [2828] Owing to a scribe's \"skip\" from one _yībārīldī_ (was\r\n   sent) to another at the end of the next sentence, the passage\r\n   is not in the Ḥai. MS. It is not well given in my translation\r\n   (f. 357_b_, p. 642); what stands above is a closer rendering\r\n   of the full Turkī, _Humāyūngha tarjuma_ [_u_?] _nī-kīm\r\n   Hindūstāngha kīlkānī aītqān ash'ārnī yībārīldī_ (Ilminsky p.\r\n   462, 1. 4 fr. ft., where however there appears a slight\r\n   clerical error).\r\n\r\n   [2829] Hesitation about accepting the colophon as\r\n   unquestionably applying to the whole contents of the\r\n   manuscript is due to its position of close association with\r\n   one section only of the three in the manuscript (cf. _post_ p.\r\n   lx).\r\n\r\n   [2830] Plate XI, and p. 15 (mid-page) of the Facsimile\r\n   booklet.—The Facsimile does not show the whole of the marginal\r\n   quatrain, obviously because for the last page of the\r\n   manuscript a larger photographic plate was needed than for the\r\n   rest. With Dr. Ross' concurrence a photograph in which the\r\n   defect is made good, accompanies this Appendix.\r\n\r\n   [2831] The second section ends on Plate XVII, and p. 21 of the\r\n   Facsimile booklet.\r\n\r\n   [2832] Needless to say that whatever the history of the\r\n   manuscript, its value as preserving poems of which no other\r\n   copy is known publicly, is untouched. This value would be\r\n   great without the marginal entries on the last page; it finds\r\n   confirmation in the identity of many of the shorter poems with\r\n   counterparts in the _Bābur-nāma_.\r\n\r\n   [2833] Another autograph of Shāh-i-jahān's is included in the\r\n   translation volume (p. xiii) of Gul-badan Begam's\r\n   _Humāyūn-nāma_. It surprises one who works habitually on\r\n   historical writings more nearly contemporary with Bābur, in\r\n   which he is spoken of as _Firdaus-makānī_ or as _Gītī-sitānī\r\n   Firdaus-makānī_ and not by the name used during his life, to\r\n   find Shāh-i-jahān giving him the two styles (cf. _Jahāngīr's\r\n   Memoirs_ trs. ii, 5). Those familiar with the writings of\r\n   Shāh-i-jahān's biographers will know whether this is usual at\r\n   that date. There would seem no doubt as to the identity of _ān\r\n   Ḥaẓrat._—The words _ān ḥaẓrat_ by which Shāh-i-jahān refers to\r\n   Bābur are used also in the epitaph placed by Jahāngīr at\r\n   Bābur's tomb (Trs. Note p. 710-711).\r\n\r\n   [2834] The Qāẓī's rapid acquirement of the _mufradāt_ of the\r\n   script allows the inference that few letters only and those of\r\n   a well-known script were varied.—_Mufradāt_ was translated by\r\n   Erskine, de Courteille and myself (f. 357_b_) as alphabet but\r\n   reconsideration by the light of more recent information about\r\n   the _Bāburī-khat̤t̤_ leads me to think this is wrong because\r\n   \"alphabet\" includes every letter.—On f. 357b three items of\r\n   the _Bāburī-khat̤t̤_ are specified as despatched with the\r\n   Hindūstān poems, _viz._ _mufradāt_, _qita`lār_ and\r\n   _sar-i-khat̤t̤_. Of these the first went to Hind-āl, the third\r\n   to Kāmrān, and no recipient is named for the second; all\r\n   translators have sent the _qita`lār_ to Hind-āl but I now\r\n   think this wrong and that a name has been omitted, probably\r\n   Humāyūn's.\r\n\r\n   [2835] f. 144_b_, p. 228, n. 3. Another interesting matter\r\n   missing from the _Bābur-nāma_ by the gap between 914 and 925\r\n   AH. is the despatch of an embassy to Czar Vassili III. in\r\n   Moscow, mentioned in Schuyler's _Turkistan_ ii, 394, Appendix\r\n   IV, Grigorief's _Russian Policy in Central Asia._ The mission\r\n   went after \"Sulṯān Bābur\" had established himself in Kābul; as\r\n   Bābur does not write of it before his narrative breaks off\r\n   abruptly in 914 AH. it will have gone after that date.\r\n\r\n   [2836] I quote from the Véliaminof-Zernov edition (p. 287)\r\n   from which de Courteille's plan of work involved extract only;\r\n   he translates the couplet, giving to _khat̤t̤_ the\r\n   double-meanings of script and down of youth (_Dictionnaire\r\n   Turque_ _s.n._ _sīghnāqī_). The _Sanglākh_ (p. 252) _s.n._\r\n   _sīghnāq_ has the following as Bābur's:—\r\n\r\n     _Chū balai khat̤t̤ī naṣīb'ng būlmāsa Bābur nī tang?\r\n     Bare khat̤t̤ almanṣūr khat̤t̤ sighnāqī mū dūr?_\r\n\r\n   [2837] Gibb's _History of Ottoman Poetry_ i, 113 and ii, 137.\r\n\r\n   [2838] Réclus' _L'Asie Russe_ p. 238.\r\n\r\n   [2839] On this same _taḥrīr qīldīm_ may perhaps rest the\r\n   opinion that the Rāmpūr MS. is autograph.\r\n\r\n   [2840] I have found no further mention of the tract; it may be\r\n   noted however that whereas Bābur calls his _Treatise on\r\n   Prosody_ (written in 931 AH.) the _`Arūẓ_, Abū'l-faẓl writes\r\n   of a _Mufaṣṣal_, a suitable name for 504 details of\r\n   transposition.\r\n\r\n   [2841] _Tūzūk-i-jahāngīr_ lith. ed. p. 149; and _Memoirs of\r\n   jahāngīr_ trs. i, 304.

W. Thomas.—It should be observed that\r\n   in this Codex the Hindūstān Section contains the purely Turkī\r\n   text found in the Ḥaidarābād Codex (cf. JRAS. 1908, p. 78).\r\n\r\n   [2846] It may indicate that the List was not copied by Bābur\r\n   but lay loose with his papers, that it is not with the\r\n   Elphinstone Codex, and is not with the `Abdu'r-raḥīm Persian\r\n   translation made from a manuscript of that same annotated\r\n   line.\r\n\r\n   [2847] Cf. _in loco_ p. 656, n. 3.\r\n\r\n   [2848] A few slight changes in the turn of expressions have\r\n   been made for clearness sake.\r\n\r\n   [2849] Index _s.n._ Mīr Bāqī of Tāshkīnt. Perhaps a better\r\n   epithet for _sa`ādạt-nishān_ than \"good-hearted\" would be one\r\n   implying his good fortune in being designated to build a\r\n   mosque on the site of the ancient Hindū temple.\r\n\r\n   [2850] There is a play here on Bāqī's name; perhaps a good\r\n   wish is expressed for his prosperity together with one for the\r\n   long permanence of the sacred building _khair_ (_khairat_).\r\n\r\n   [2851] Presumably the order for building the mosque was given\r\n   during Bābur's stay in Aūd (Ajodhya) in 934 AH. at which time\r\n   he would be impressed by the dignity and sanctity of the\r\n   ancient Hindū shrine it (at least in part) displaced, and like\r\n   the obedient follower of Muḥammad he was in intolerance of\r\n   another Faith, would regard the substitution of a temple by a\r\n   mosque as dutiful and worthy.—The mosque was finished in 935\r\n   AH. but no mention of its completion is in the _Bābur-nāma_.\r\n   The diary for 935 AH. has many minor _lacunæ_; that of the\r\n   year 934 AH. has lost much matter, breaking off before where\r\n   the account of Aūd might be looked for.\r\n\r\n   [2852] The meaning of this couplet is incomplete without the\r\n   couplet that followed it and is (now) not legible.\r\n\r\n   [2853] Firishta gives a different reason for Bābur's sobriquet\r\n   of _qalandar_, namely, that he kept for himself none of the\r\n   treasure he acquired in Hindūstān (Lith. ed. p. 206).\r\n\r\n   [2854] Jahāngīr who encamped in the Shahr-ārā-garden in Ṣafar\r\n   1016 AH. (May 1607 AD.) says it was made by Bābur's aunt,\r\n   Abū-sa`īd's daughter Shahr-bānū (Rogers and Beveridge's\r\n   _Memoirs of Jahāngīr_ i, 106).\r\n\r\n   [2855] A _jalau-khāna_ might be where horse-head-gear, bridles\r\n   and reins are kept, but _Āyīn_ 60 (A.-i-A.) suggests there may\r\n   be another interpretation.\r\n\r\n   [2856] She was a daughter of Hind-āl, was a grand-daughter\r\n   therefore of Bābur, was Akbar's first wife, and brought up\r\n   Shāh-i-jahān. Jahāngīr mentions that she made her first\r\n   pilgrimage to her father's tomb on the day he made his to\r\n   Bābur's, Friday Ṣafar 26th 1016 AH. (June 12th 1607 AD.). She\r\n   died _æt._ 84 on Jumāda I. 7th 1035 AH. (Jan. 25th 1626 AD.).\r\n   Cf. _Tūzūk-i-jahāngīrī_, Muḥ. Hādī's Supplement lith. ed. p.\r\n   401.\r\n\r\n   [2857] Mr. H. H. Hayden's photograph of the mosque shows\r\n   pinnacles and thus enables its corner to be identified in his\r\n   second of the tomb itself.\r\n\r\n   [2858] One of Daniel's drawings (which I hope to reproduce)\r\n   illuminates this otherwise somewhat obscure passage, by\r\n   showing the avenue, the borders of running-water and the\r\n   little water-falls,—all reminding of Madeira.\r\n\r\n   [2859] _chokī_, perhaps \"shelter\"; see Hobson-Jobson _s.n._\r\n\r\n   [2860] If told with leisurely context, the story of the visits\r\n   of Bābur's descendants to Kābul and of their pilgrimages to\r\n   his tomb, could hardly fail to interest its readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF BABUR OR BABUR-NAMA\r\n\r\n   Index I.

(1) My \"Chaghatāī\" had warrant (now\r\n   rejected) in Ḥaidar's statement (T.R. trs. p. 3) that the Dūghlāt\r\n   amirs were of the same stock (_abna`-i-jins_) as the Chaghatāī\r\n   Khāqāns. But the Dūghlāt off-take from the common stem was of earlier\r\n   date than Chīngīz Khān's, hence, his son's name \"Chaghatāī\" is a\r\n   misnomer for Dūghlāts. (2) As for \"Mūghūl\" to designate Dūghlāt, and\r\n   also Chaghatāī chiefs—guidance for us rests with the chiefs\r\n   themselves; these certainly (as did also the Begchīk chiefs) held\r\n   themselves apart from \"Mughūls of the horde\" and begs of the horde—as\r\n   apart they had become by status as chiefs, by intermarriage, by\r\n   education, and by observance of the amenities of civilized life. To\r\n   describe Dūghlāt, Chaghatāī and Begchīk chiefs in Bābur's day as\r\n   Mughūls is against their self-classification and is a discourtesy. A\r\n   clear instance of need of caution in the use of the word Mughūl is\r\n   that of `Alī-sher _Nawā'ī Chaghatāī_. (Cf. Abū'l-ghāzī's accounts of\r\n   the formation of several tribes.) (3) That \"Mughūl\" described for\r\n   Hindustānis Bābur's invading and conquering armies does not\r\n   obliterate distinctions in its chiefs. Mughūls of the horde followed\r\n   Tīmūrids when to do so suited them; there were also in Bābur's armies\r\n   several chiefs of the ruling Chaghatāī family, brothers of The Khān,\r\n   Sa`īd (_see_ Chīn-tīmūr, Aīsan-tīmūr, Tūkhta-būghā). With these must\r\n   have been their following of \"Mughūls of the horde\".\r\n\r\n   P. 34 l. 12.—\"With the goshawks\" translates _qīrchīgha bīla_ of the\r\n   Elph. MS. (f. 12_b_) where it is explained marginally by _ba bāzī_,\r\n   with the falcon or goshawk. The Ḥai. MS. however has, in its text,\r\n   _pīāzī bīla_ which may mean with arrows having points (_Sanglākh_ f.\r\n   144_b_ quoting this passage). Ilminski has no answering word (_Méms._\r\n   i, 19). Muḥ. _Shirāzī_ [p. 13 l. 11 fr. ft.] writes _ba bāzī\r\n   mīandākhtan_.\r\n\r\n   P. 39.—The _Ḥabību's-siyar_ (lith. ed. iii, 217 l. 16) writes of\r\n   Sayyid Murād _Āūghlāqchī_ (the father or g.f. of Yūsuf) that he (who\r\n   had, Bābur says, come from the Mughūl horde) held high rank under\r\n   Abū-sa`īd Mīrzā, joined Ḥusian _Bāī-qarā_ after the Mīrzā's defeat\r\n   and death (873 A.H.), and (p. 218) was killed in defeat by Amīr `Alī\r\n   _Jalāīr_ who was commanding for Yādgār-i-muḥammad _Shāh-rukhī_.\r\n\r\n   P. 49.—An _Aīmāq_ is a division of persons and not of territory. In\r\n   Mongolia under the Chinese Government it answers to khanate. A Khān\r\n   is at the head of an _aīmāq_. Aīmāqs are divided into _koshung_,\r\n   _i.e._ banners (_Mongolia_, N. Prejevalsky trs. E. Delmar Morgan, ii,\r\n   53).\r\n\r\n   P. 75 and n. 1.—For an explanation, provided in 94 AH., of why\r\n   Samarkand was called _Baldat-i-maḥfūẓa_, the Guarded-city, see\r\n   Daulat-shāh, Browne's ed. _s.n._ Qulaiba p. 443.\r\n\r\n   P. 85 n. 2.—The reference to the _Ḥabību's-siyar_ confuses two\r\n   cases of parricide:—`Abdu'l-laṯīf's of Aulugh Beg (853-1447) to which\r\n   Ḥ.S. refers [Vol. III, Part 2, p. 163, l. 13 fr. ft.] with (one of\r\n   7-628) Shīrūya's of Khusrau Parvīz (Ḥ.S. Vol. I, Part 2, p. 44, l. 11\r\n   fr. ft.) where the parricide's sister tells him that the murderer of\r\n   his father (and 15 brothers) would eventually be punished by God, and\r\n   (a little lower) the couplet Bābur quotes (p. 85) is entered (H.B.).\r\n\r\n   P. 154 n. 3.—The Persian phrase in the _Siyāsat-nāma_ which describes\r\n   the numbering of the army (T. _dīm kūrmāk_) is _ba sar-i-tāzīāna\r\n   shumurdan_. Schafer translates _tāzīāna_ by _cravache_. I have\r\n   nowhere found how the whip was used; (cf. S.N. Pers. text p. 15 l.\r\n   5).\r\n\r\n   P. 171 n. 1.—Closer acquaintance with Bābur's use of _daryā_, _rūd_,\r\n   _sū_, the first of which he reserves for a great river, casts doubt\r\n   on my suggestion that _daryā_ may stand for the Kāsān-water. But the\r\n   narrative supports what I have noted. The \"upper villages\" of Akhsī\r\n   might be, however, those higher up on the Saiḥūn-daryā (Sīr-daryā).\r\n\r\n   P. 189 and n. 1.—A third and perhaps here better rendering of _bī\r\n   bāqī_ is that of p. 662 (_s.d._ April 10th), \"leaving none behind.\"\r\n\r\n   P. 196.—The _Habību's-siyar_ (lith. ed. iii, 250 l. 11 fr. ft.)\r\n   writes of _barādarān_ of Khusrau Shāh, Amīr Walī and Pīr Walī. As it\r\n   is improbable that two brothers (Anglicé) would be called Walī, it\r\n   may be right to translate _barādarān_ by brethren, and to understand\r\n   a brother and a cousin. Bābur mentions only the brother Walī.\r\n\r\n   P. 223 ll. 1-3 fr. ft.—The French translation, differing from\r\n   `Abdu'r-rahim's and Erskine's, reads Bābur as saying of the ranges\r\n   separating the cultivated lands of Kabul, that they are _comme des\r\n   ponts de trèfle_, but this does not suit the height and sometimes\r\n   permanent snows of some of the separating ranges.—My bald \"(great)\r\n   dams\" should have been expanded to suit the meaning (as I take it to\r\n   be) of the words _Yūr-ūnchaqā pul-dik_, like embankments (_pul_)\r\n   against going (_yūr_) further; (so far, _ūncha_). Cf. Griffiths'\r\n   _Journal_, p. 431.\r\n\r\n   P. 251.—Niẕāmī expresses the opinion that \"Fate is an avenging\r\n   servitor\" but not in the words used by Bābur (p. 251). He does this\r\n   when moralizing on Farhad's death, brought about by Khusrau's trick\r\n   and casting the doer into dread of vengeance (H. B.).\r\n\r\n   P. 266 n. 7.—On p. 266 Bābur allots three daughters to Pāpā Aghācha\r\n   and on p. 269 four. Various details make for four. But, if four, the\r\n   total of eleven (p. 261) is exceeded.\r\n\r\n   P. 276 para. 3.—Attention is attracted on this page to the unusual\r\n   circumstance that a parent and child are both called by the same\r\n   name, Junaid. One other instance is found in the _Bābur-nāma_, that\r\n   of Bābur's wife Ma`ṣuma and her daughter. Perhaps \"Junaid\" like\r\n   \"Ma`ṣūma\" was the name given to the child because birth closely\r\n   followed the death of the parent (_see_ _s.n._ Ma`ṣūma).\r\n\r\n   P. 277.—Concerning Bih-būd Beg the _Shaībānī-nāma_ gives the\r\n   following information:—he was in command in Khwārizm and Khīva when\r\n   Shaibānī moved against Chīn _Ṣūfī_ (910 AH.), and spite of his name,\r\n   was unpopular (Vambéry's ed. 184, 186). Vambéry's note 88 says he is\r\n   mentioned in the (anonymous) prose _Shaibānī-nāma_, Russian trs. p.\r\n   lxi.\r\n\r\n   P. 372 l. 2 fr. ft.—Where the Ḥai. MS. and Kāsān Imp. have _mu`āraẓ_,\r\n   rival, E. and de C. translate by representative, but the following\r\n   circumstances favour \"rival\":—Wais was with Bābur (pp. 374-6) and\r\n   would need no representative. His arrival is not recorded; no\r\n   introductory particulars are given of him where his name is first\r\n   found (p. 372); therefore he is likely to have joined Bābur in the\r\n   time of the gap of 924 AH. (p. 366), before the siege of Bajaur-fort\r\n   and before `Alā'u'd-dīn did so. The two Sawādī chiefs received gifts\r\n   and left together (p. 376).\r\n\r\n   P. 393 l. 4.—In this couplet the point lies in the double-meaning of\r\n   _ra`iyat_, subject and peasant.\r\n\r\n   P. 401.—Under date Thursday 25th Bābur mentions an appointment to\r\n   read _fiqah sabaqī_ to him. Erskine translated this by \"Sacred\r\n   extracts from the Qorān\" (I followed this). But \"lessons in theology\"\r\n   may be a better rendering—as more literal and as allowing for the use\r\n   of other writings than the Qorān. A correspondent Mr. G. Yazdānī\r\n   (Gov. Epigraphist for Muslim Inscriptions, Haidarabad) tells us that\r\n   it is customary amongst Muslims to recite religious books on\r\n   Thursdays.\r\n\r\n   P. 404 l. 7 fr. ft.—Bābā Qashqa (or Qāshqā)'s family-group is\r\n   somewhat interesting as that of loyal and capable men of Mughūl birth\r\n   who served Bābur and Humāyūn. It must have joined Bābur in what is\r\n   now the gap between 914 and 925 AH. because not mentioned earlier and\r\n   because he is first mentioned in 925 AH. without introductory\r\n   particulars. The following details supplement _Bābur-nāma_\r\n   information about the group:—(1) Of Bāba Qashqa's murder by\r\n   Muḥammad-i-zamān _Bāī-qarā_ Gul-hadan (f. 23) makes record, and\r\n   Badāyūnī (Bib. Ind. ed. i, 450) says that (_cir._ 952 AH.) when\r\n   Bābā's son Ḥājī Muḥ. Khān _Kūkī_ had pursued and overtaken the rebel\r\n   Kāmrān, the Mīrzā asked, as though questioning the Khān's ground of\r\n   hostility to himself, \"But did I kill thy father Bābā Qashqa?\"\r\n   (_Pidrat Bābā Qashqa magar man kushta am?_).—(2) Of the death of Bābā\r\n   Qashqa's brother \"Kūkī\", Abū'l-faẓl records that he was killed in\r\n   Hindūstān by Muḥammad Sl. M. _Bāī-qarā_ (952 AH.), and that Kūkī's\r\n   nephew Shāh Muḥ. (_see_ p. 668) retaliated (955 AH.) by\r\n   arrow-shooting one of Muḥ. Sl. Mīrzā's sons. This was done when Shāh\r\n   Muḥ. was crossing Mīnār-pass on his return journey from sharing\r\n   Humāyūn's exile in Persia (_see_ Jauhar).—(3) Hājī Muḥ. Khān _Kūkī_\r\n   and Shāh Muḥammad Khān appear to have been sons of Bābā Qashqa and\r\n   nephews of \"Kūkī\" (_supra_). They were devoted servants of Humāyūn\r\n   but were put to death by him in 958 AH.-1551 AD. (cf. Erskine's _H.\r\n   of I. Humāyūn_).—(4) About the word _Kūkī_ dictionaries afford no\r\n   warrant for taking it to mean foster-brother (_kokah_). Chīngīz Khān\r\n   had a beg known as Kūk or Kouk (or Gūk) and one of his own grandsons\r\n   used the same style. It may link the Bābā Qashqā group with the\r\n   Chīngīz Khānid Kūkī, either as descendants or as hereditary\r\n   adherents, or as both. (_See_ Abū'l-ghāzī's _Shajarat-i-Turk_, trs.\r\n   Désmaisons, Index _s.n._ _Kouk_ and also its accounts of the origin\r\n   of several tribal groups.)\r\n\r\n   P. 416.—The line quoted by `Abdu'l-lāh is from the _Anwār-i-suhailī_,\r\n   Book II, Story i. Eastwick translates it and its immediate context\r\n   thus:—\r\n\r\n     \"People follow the faith of their kings.\r\n      My heart is like a tulip scorched and by sighings flame;\r\n      In all thou seest, their hearts are scorched and stained\r\n        the same.\" (H.B.)\r\n\r\n   The offence of the quotation appears to have been against Khalīfa,\r\n   and might be a suggestion that he followed Bābur in breach of Law by\r\n   using wine.\r\n\r\n   P. 487 n. 2.—The following passages complete the note on _wulsa_\r\n   quoted by Erskine from Col. Mark Wilks' _Historical Sketches_ and\r\n   show how the word is used:—\"During the absence of Major Lawrence from\r\n   Trichinopoly, the town had been completely depopulated by the removal\r\n   of the whole _Wulsa_ to seek for food elsewhere, and the enemy had\r\n   been earnestly occupied in endeavouring to surprise the garrison.\"\r\n   (Here follows Erskine's quotation _see in loco_ p. 487). \"The people\r\n   of a district thus deserting their homes are called the _Wulsa_ of\r\n   that district, a state of utmost misery, involving precaution against\r\n   incessant war and unpitying depredation—so peculiar a description as\r\n   to require in any of the languages of Europe a long circumlocution,\r\n   is expressed _in all the languages of Deckan and the south of India\r\n   by a single word_. No proofs can be accumulated from the most\r\n   profound research which shall describe the immemorial condition of\r\n   the people of India with more precision than this single word. It is\r\n   a bright distinction that the _Wulsa_ never departs on the approach\r\n   of a British army when this is unaccompanied by Indian allies.\"—By\r\n   clerical error in the final para. of my note _ūlvash_ is entered for\r\n   _ūlvan_ [Molesworth, any desolating calamity].\r\n\r\n   P. 540 n. 4.—An explanation of Bābur's use of Shāh-zāda as T̤ahmāsp's\r\n   title may well be that this title answers to the Tīmūrid one\r\n   Mīr-zāda, Mīrzā. If so, Bābur's change to \"Shāh\" (p. 635) may\r\n   recognize supremacy by victory, such as he had claimed for himself in\r\n   913 AH. when he changed his Tīmūrid \"Mīrzā\" for \"Pādshāh\".\r\n\r\n   P. 557.—Ḥusain _Kashīfī_, also, quotes Firdausī's couplet in the\r\n   _Anwār-i-suhaili_ (Cap. I, Story XXI), a book dedicated to Shaikh\r\n   Aḥmad _Suhaīlī_ (p. 277) and of earlier date than the _Bābur-nāma_.\r\n   Its author died in 910 AH.-1505 AD.\r\n\r\n   P. 576 n. 1.—Tod's statement (quoted in my n. 1) that \"the year of\r\n   Rānā Sangā's defeat (933 AH.) was the last of his existence\" cannot\r\n   be strictly correct because Bābur's statement (p. 598) of intending\r\n   attack on him in Chitor allows him to have been alive in 934 AH.\r\n   (1528 AD.). The death occurred, \"not without suspicion of poison,\"\r\n   says Tod, when the Rānā had moved against Irij then held for Bābur;\r\n   it will have been long enough before the end of 934 AH. to allow an\r\n   envoy from his son Bikramājīt to wait on Bābur in that year (pp. 603,\r\n   612). Bābur's record of it may safely be inferred lost with the\r\n   once-existent matter of 934 AH.\r\n\r\n   P. 631.—My husband has ascertained that the \"Sayyid Daknī\" of p. 631\r\n   is Sayyid Shāh T̤āhir _Daknī_ (_Deccani_) the Shiite apostle of\r\n   Southern India, who in 935 AH. was sent to Bābur with a letter from\r\n   Burhān Niẕām Shāh of Ahmadnagar, in which (if there were not two\r\n   embassies) congratulation was made on the conquest of Dihlī and help\r\n   asked against Bahādur Shāh _Gujrātī_. A second but earlier mention of\r\n   \"Sayyid _Daknī_\" (_Zaknī_, _Ruknī?_) _Shīrāzī_ is on p. 619. Whether\r\n   the two entries refer to Shāh T̤āhir nothing makes clear. The\r\n   cognomen Shīrāzī disassociates them. It is always to be kept in mind\r\n   that preliminary events are frequently lost in gaps; one such will be\r\n   the arrivals of the various envoys, mentioned on p. 630, whose places\r\n   of honour are specified on p. 631. Much is on record about Sayyid\r\n   Shāh T̤āhir _Daknī_ and particulars of his life are available in the\r\n   histories by Badāyūnī (Ranking trs.) and (Firishta Nawal Kishor ed.\r\n   p. 105); B.M. Harleyan MS. No. 199 contains his letters (_see_ Rieu's\r\n   Pers. Cat. p. 395).\r\n\r\n   P. 699 and n. 3.—The particulars given by the _T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī_\r\n   about Mulṯān at this date (932-4 AH.) are as follows:—After Bābur\r\n   took the Panj-āb, he ordered Shāh Ḥasan _Arghūn_ to attempt Mulṯān,\r\n   then held by one Sl. Maḥmūd who, dying, was succeeded by an infant\r\n   son Ḥusain. Shāh Ḥāsan took Mulṯān after a 16 (lunar) months' siege,\r\n   at the end of 934 AH. (in a B.N. _lacuna_ therefore), looted and\r\n   slaughtered in it, and then returned to Tatta. On this Langar Khān\r\n   took possession of it (H.B.). What part `Askarī (_æt._ 12) had in the\r\n   matter is yet to learn; possibly he was nominated to its command and\r\n   then recalled as Bābur mentions (935 AH.).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [2861] The fist indicates Translator's matter.\r\n\r\n   [2862] See Abū'l-ghāzī's _Shajarat-i-turkī_ on the origin and\r\n   characteristics of the tribe (Désmaisons trs.

But he may have been a\r\n   Turkmān.\r\n\r\n   [2883] The MS. variants between `Alī and -qulī are confusing.\r\n   What stands in my text (p. 27) may be less safe than the\r\n   above.\r\n\r\n   [2884] Bābā Qashqa was murdered by Muḥammad-i-zamān\r\n   _Bāī-qarā_. For further particulars of his family group see\r\n   Add. Notes under p. 404.\r\n\r\n   [2885] Sulṯan Bābā-qulī Beg is found variously designated Qulī\r\n   Beg, Qulī Bābā, Sl. `Alī Bābā-qulī, Sulṯān-qūlī Bābā and\r\n   Bābā-qulī Beg. Several forms appear to express his filial\r\n   relationship with Sulṯān Bābā `Alī (_q.v._).\r\n\r\n   [2886] Down to p. 346 Bābur's statements are retrospective;\r\n   after p. 346 they are mostly contemporary with the dates of\r\n   his diary—when not so are in supplementing passages of later\r\n   date.\r\n\r\n   [2887] He may be the father of Mun`im Khān (Blochmann's\r\n   Biographies A.-i-A. trs. 317 and n. 2).\r\n\r\n   [2888] See note, Index, _s.n._ Muḥammad Ẕakarīa.\r\n\r\n   [2889] He is likely to have been introduced with some\r\n   particulars of tribe, in one of the now unchronicled years\r\n   after Bābur's return from his Trans-oxus campaign.\r\n\r\n   [2890] His wife, daughter of a wealthy man and on the mother's\r\n   side niece of Sulṯān Buhlūl _Lūdī_, financed the military\r\n   efforts of Bāyazīd and Bīban (_Tārīkh-i-sher-shāhī_, E. and D.\r\n   iv, 353 ff.).\r\n\r\n   [2891] My translation on p. 621 l. 12 is inaccurate inasmuch\r\n   as it hides the circumstance that Beg-gīna alone was the\r\n   \"messenger of good tidings\".\r\n\r\n   [2892] In taking Bīban for a Jilwānī, I follow Erskine, (as\r\n   inferences also warrant,) but he may be a Lūdī.\r\n\r\n   [2893] For the same uncertainty between Bihār and Pahār see E.\r\n   and D.'s History of India iv, 352 n. 2.\r\n\r\n   [2894] Firishta lith. ed. i, 202.\r\n\r\n   [2895] For \"Mū'min\" read Mūmin, which form is constant in the\r\n   Ḥai. MS.\r\n\r\n   [2896] He may be Ḥamīda-bānū's father and, if so, became\r\n   grandfather of Akbar.\r\n\r\n   [2897] Ilminsky, _anlū_, Erskine, _angū_. Daulat-shāh mentions\r\n   a Muḥammad Shāh _anjū_ (see Brown's ed. Index _s.n._).\r\n\r\n   [2898] On p. 22 n. 2 delete \"_Chaghatāī Mughūl_\" on grounds\r\n   given in Additional Note, Page 22.\r\n\r\n   [2899] For Humāyūn's annotation of the _Bābur-nāma_, see\r\n   General Index _s.n._ Humāyūn's Notes.\r\n\r\n   [2900] For a correction of dates, see _s.n._ Aūlūgh Beg.\r\n\r\n   [2901] On p. 279 l. 3 from foot read \"There was also Ibrāhīm\r\n   _Chaghatāī_\" after \"Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā\".\r\n\r\n   [2902] _Addendum_:—p. 49 l. 4, read \"wife\" of Muḥammadī \"son\"\r\n   of Jahān-shāh.\r\n\r\n   [2903] His name might mean Welcome, _Bien-venu_.\r\n\r\n   [2904] Khusrau-shāh may be the more correct form.\r\n\r\n   [2905] The \"afterwards\" points to an omission which\r\n   Khwānd-amīr's account of Ḥusain's daughters fills (lith. ed.\r\n   iii, 327).\r\n\r\n   [2906] No record survives of the Khwāja's deeds of daring\r\n   other than those entered above; perhaps the other instances\r\n   Bābur refers to occurred during the gap 908-9 AH.\r\n\r\n   [2907] This may be a tribal or a family name. Abū'l-ghāzī\r\n   mentions two individuals named \"Kouk\". One was Chīngīz Khān's\r\n   grandson who is likely to have had descendants or followers\r\n   distinguishable as _Kūkī_. See Add. Note P. 673 on Kūkī fate.\r\n\r\n   [2908] Cf. E. and D. for \"Karānī\" (_e.g._ vol. iv, 530). The\r\n   Ḥai. MS. sometimes doubles the _r_, sometimes not.\r\n\r\n   [2909] See _Wāqi`āt-i-mushtāqī_, E. and D. iv, 548.\r\n\r\n   [2910] Shaikhīm _Suhailī_ however was named Aḥmad (277) not\r\n   Muhammad.\r\n\r\n   [2911] The record of the first appears likely to be lost in\r\n   the _lacuna_ of 934 AH.\r\n\r\n   [2912] See _Shaibānī-nāma_, Vambéry's ed. Cap. xv, l. 12, for\r\n   his changes of service, and Sām Mīrzā's _Tuḥfa-i-sāmī_ for\r\n   various particulars including his classification as a\r\n   Chaghatāī.\r\n\r\n   [2913] He died serving Bābur, at Kūl-i-malik (Ḥ.S. iii,\r\n   344).—Further information negatives my suggestion (201 n. 7)\r\n   that he and Mīr Ḥusain (p. 288 and n. 7) were one.\r\n\r\n   [2914] \"Zaitun is the name of the Chinese city from which\r\n   satin was brought (_hodie_ Thsiuancheu or Chincheu) and my\r\n   belief is that our word satin came from it\" (Col. H. Yule, E.\r\n   and D. iv, 514).\r\n\r\n   [2915] My text omits to translate _yīgīt_ (_aūghūl_) and thus\r\n   loses the information that Yaḥyā's sons Bāqī and Ẕakarīa were\r\n   above childhood, were grown to fighting age—braves—but not yet\r\n   begs (see Index _s.n._ _chuhra_).\r\n\r\n   [2916] See Add.

Fertī's trs. p. 70 for the same name Qaitmās.\r\n\r\n   [2921] His capture is not recorded.\r\n\r\n   [2922] He joined Bābur with his father Yār-i-`alī _Balāl_\r\n   (_q.v._) in 910 AH. (Blochmann's Biographies, A.-i-A. trs.\r\n   315).\r\n\r\n   [2923] Concerning the date of his death, see Additional Notes\r\n   under p. 603.\r\n\r\n   [2924] Since my text was printed, my husband has lighted upon\r\n   what shows that the guest at the feast was an ambassador sent\r\n   by Burhān Niẕām Shāh of Aḥmadnagar to congratulate Bābur on\r\n   his conquest of Dihlī, namely, Shāh T̤āhir the apostle of\r\n   Shiism in the Dakkan. He is thus distinguished from Sayyid\r\n   Daknī, (Ruknī, Zaknī) _infra_ and my text needs suitable\r\n   correction. (See Add. Notes under p. 631 for further\r\n   particulars of the Sayyid and his embassy.)\r\n\r\n   [2925] For further particulars see Add. Note under p. 688.\r\n\r\n   [2926] For \"H.S. ii\" read iii (as also in some other places).\r\n\r\n   [2927] Down to p. 131 the Ḥai. MS. uses the name Shaibānī or\r\n   Shaibānī Khān; from that page onwards it writes Shaibāq Khān,\r\n   in agreement with the Elphinstone MS.—Other names found are\r\n   _e.g._ Gulbadan's Shāhī Beg Khān and Shah-bakht. (My note 2 on\r\n   p. 12 needs modification.)\r\n\r\n   [2928] The title \"Aūghlān\" (child, boy) indicates that the\r\n   bearer died without ruling.\r\n\r\n   [2929] This cognomen was given because the bearer was born\r\n   during an eclipse of the moon (_āī_, moon and the root _al_\r\n   taking away); _see_ Badāyūnī Bib. Ind. ed. i, 62.\r\n\r\n   [2930] Here _delete_ \"Sulṯān-nigar Khānīm\", who was his\r\n   grandmother and not his mother.\r\n\r\n   [2931] On p. 433 n. 1 her name is mistakenly entered as that\r\n   of Sulaimān's mother.\r\n\r\n   [2932] Concerning this title, see Add. Notes under p. 540.\r\n\r\n   [2933] He may be the Tūlik Khān _qūchīn_ of the\r\n   _Ma`asiru'l-umrā_ i, 475.\r\n\r\n   [2934] Ḥaidar Mīrzā gives an interesting account of his\r\n   character and attainments (T.R. trs. p. 283).\r\n\r\n   [2935] See Additional Note under P. 372.\r\n\r\n   [2936] See Additional Notes under P. 51.\r\n\r\n   [2937] Here the Ḥai.

See p. 678 and n. 4 as to\r\n   \"Sections\".\r\n\r\n   [2939] The entries of 934 and 935 may concern a second man\r\n   `Alī-i-yūsuf.\r\n\r\n   [2940] Perhaps skilled in the art of metaphors and tropes\r\n   (_`ilmu'l-badī`_).\r\n\r\n   [2941] My text has _julgāsī_, but I am advised to omit the\r\n   genitive _sī_; so, too, in aīkī-sū-ārā-sī, Rabāṭjk-aūrchīn-ī\r\n   _q.v._\r\n\r\n   [2942] Cf. _s.n._ Āhangaran-julga n. as to form of the name.\r\n\r\n   [2943] Asterisks indicate Translator's matter.\r\n\r\n   [2944] Bābur uses this name for, Anglicé, the Kābul-river as\r\n   low as nearly to Dakka.\r\n\r\n   [2945] \"The Dara-i-ṣūf, often mentioned by the Arabian\r\n   writers, seems to lie west of Bāmīān\" (Erskine, _Memoirs_, p.\r\n   152 n. 1).\r\n\r\n   [2946] Bābur's itinerary gives Gharjistan a greater eastward\r\n   extent than the Fr. map Maïmènè allows, thus agreeing with\r\n   Erskine's surmise (_Memoirs_ p. 152 n. 1).—The first syllable\r\n   of the name may be \"Ghur\".\r\n\r\n   [2947] On p. 7, l. 1, after \"turbulent\", _add_, \" They are\r\n   notorious in Māwarā'u'n-nahr for their bullying.\"\r\n\r\n   [2948] On p. 134 for \"(I was) 19\" _read_ in my 19th (lunar)\r\n   year.\r\n\r\n   [2949] Cf. _Life of Busbecq_ (Forster and Daniels) i, 252-7,\r\n   for feats of Turkish archery.\r\n\r\n   [2950] For the Bukhara (Bābur-nāma) Compilation _see_\r\n   _Wāqi`-nāma-i-pādshāhi_; as also for its Codices, descendants\r\n   and offtakes, _viz._ Ilminski's \"_Bābur-nāma_\" and de\r\n   Courteille's _Mémoires de Baber_.\r\n\r\n   [2951] The confusion of identity has become clear to me in\r\n   1921 only.\r\n\r\n   [2952] One of the nine great gods of the Etruscans was called\r\n   Tūrān. Etr. _Tūr_ means strong, a strong place (fortress);\r\n   with it may connect L. _turma_ (troop) and the name of\r\n   Virgil's Rutulian hero Turmus may root in the Mongol tongue.\r\n   Professor Jules Marthe writes in _La Langue Etrusque_ (Pref.\r\n   vi), \"Il m'a paru qu'il y avait entre l'Etrusque et les\r\n   langues finns-ougriennes d'étroites affinités\" (hence with the\r\n   Mongol tongue). \"Tarkhān\" is \"Tūrkhān\" in Miles trs. p. 71 of\r\n   the _Shajaratu'l-atrāk_ (H. B.).\r\n\r\n   [2953] This Cat. contains the Turkī MS. of the Bukhara\r\n   Compilation, once owned by Leyden.\r\n\r\n   [2954] where, in n. 3, for f. 183_b_ and f. 264_b_ _read_ f.\r\n   103_b_ and f. 264.\r\n\r\n   [2955] For \"Ḥ.S. ii\" read Ḥ.S. iii—also on p. 244.\r\n\r\n   [2956] On this peg may be hung the following note:—The\r\n   _Pādshāh-nāma_ (_q.v._) calls the author and presenter of the\r\n   above translation \"Abū-ṯālib\" _Ḥusainī_ (Bib. Ind. ed. vol. i,\r\n   part 2, p. 288), but its index contains many references\r\n   seemingly to the same man as Khwāja Abū'l-husain _Turbati_.\r\n   The P. N. says the book which it entitles\r\n   _Wāqi`āt-i-ṣaḥib-qirān_ (The Acts of Tīmūr), was in Turki, was\r\n   brought forth from the Library of the (Turk) Governor of Yemen\r\n   and translated by Mīr Abū-ṯālib _Ḥusainī_; that what Timūr had\r\n   done with this book of counsel (_dastān-i-nasā'iḥ_) when he\r\n   sent it to his son Pīr-i-muhammad, then succeeding (his\r\n   brother) Jahāngīr [in Kābul, the Ghaznis, Qandahār, _etc._]\r\n   Shāhjahān also did by sending it, out of love, to his son\r\n   Aurangzīb who had been ordered to the Deccan.\r\n\r\n   [2957] In n. 5 for \"_parwān_\" read _parrān_, and _read_\r\n   Blanford.\r\n\r\n   [2958] Which _read_ (l. 17) for _yak rang_. The name\r\n   _bak-dīng_ appears due to the clapping of the bird's mandibles\r\n   and its pompous strut; (cf. Ross' _Polyglot List_, No. 336).\r\n\r\n   [2959] Following the _zammaj_ insert \"Another is the buzzard\r\n   (T. _Sār_); its back and tail are red\". (_Cf._ Omission List\r\n   under p. 500.)\r\n\r\n   [2960] _See_ Omission List under p. 498.\r\n\r\n   [2961] After \"Tramontane\", _add_ Its breast is less deeply\r\n   black.\r\n\r\n   [2962] The bird being black, its name cannot be translated\r\n   \"yellow-bird\"; as noted on p. 373 _sārīgh_ = thief; [_sārāgh_\r\n   or _sārīgh_ means a bird's song].\r\n\r\n   [2963] For references to Niẕāmi's text, I am indebted to Mr.\r\n   Beveridge's knowledge of the poems.\r\n\r\n   [2964] Cf. Mr. G. Murray's trs. (Euripides i, 86) suggesting\r\n   that the Wooden Horse was a _sar-kob_.\r\n\r\n   [2965] Abū'l-ghāzī classes Manghīt with Mughul tribes, Radloff\r\n   with Turk tribes (_Récueils p. 325_), Erskine says, \"modern\r\n   Nogais.\"\r\n\r\n_Stephen Austin and Sons, Ltd., Printers, Hertford._",
