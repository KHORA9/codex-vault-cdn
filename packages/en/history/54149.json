I would ask him to remember that\r\nthere are many almost insurmountable difficulties to be faced in the\r\naccomplishment of a work like this, and a narrowed space adds to rather\r\nthan diminishes from their antagonistic power.\r\n\r\nWhen the work was first proposed to me, it was imagined that the subject\r\ncould be fully disposed of in less than five hundred pages. I have\r\nalready gone considerably over that number, and feel that the charge of\r\nincompleteness may still be brought against the book. But I also feel\r\nthat if I had extended it to five thousand pages, the charge could still\r\nhave been made, for with such a subject actual exhaustion cannot be\r\nexpected; and so, despite the great quantity of unused material I have\r\nyet by me, I must rest satisfied with what I have done. I trust the\r\nreader will be satisfied also.\r\n\r\nAlmost everybody has in the course of his lifetime discovered some sort\r\nof a pet advertisement without which he considers no collection can be\r\ncomplete. During the progress of this “history” I have received many\r\nhundreds such--have received sufficient, with accompanying notes, to\r\nfill a bigger volume than this--and I can therefore imagine every fresh\r\nreader turning to look for his favourite, and, in the event of his\r\nfinding it not, condemning the book unconditionally. I hope that in the\r\nevent of a reconsideration some worthy representative will be found\r\noccupying the missing one’s place. In like manner, and judging by my own\r\nfriends’ observations, I have found that almost every one would have\r\ntreated the “history” differently, not only from my way but from each\r\nother’s. Every one would have done something wonderful with such a\r\nwonderful subject. It will not be out of place perhaps, therefore, to\r\nask the reader to think, that because the system adopted has not been\r\nthat which would have suggested itself to him, it is not necessarily the\r\nwrong one after all.\r\n\r\nI have received much assistance during the time I have been at work, in\r\nthe way of hints and observations. For those which I have accepted, as\r\nwell as for those I have been compelled to reject, I hereby tender my\r\nheartfelt thanks. Little in the way of so-called statistics of modern\r\nadvertisers will be found in the book, as I fancy it is better to be\r\nsilent than to make untrustworthy statements; and this remark will\r\nparticularly apply to the amounts of annual outlay generally published\r\nin connection with the names of large advertising firms. My own\r\nexperience is that the firms or their managers are not aware of the\r\nexact sums expended by them, or, if they are, do not feel inclined to\r\ntell in anything but the vaguest manner. Another observation I have made\r\nis, that extensive advertising is likely to result in a desire for the\r\nexaggeration of facts--at all events, so far as the individual\r\nadvertisers themselves are concerned. That any firm, tradesmen,\r\nmanufacturers, agents, quacks, perfumers, patentees, or whatever they\r\nmay be, pay a settled annual sum, no more and no less, for advertising,\r\nI do not believe now, whatever I may have done before commencing my\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured as much as possible, and wherever practicable, to\r\nmake the advertisements tell their own story. At the same time I have\r\ntried hard to prevent waste of space, and so far have, if in no other\r\nway, succeeded. This is but little merit to claim, and if I am allowed\r\nthat, I shall be satisfied. Also, if my endeavour should lead to a\r\ndevelopment of that laudable spirit of emulation so apparent nowadays\r\nafter the ice has been once broken, I shall be happy to supply any\r\nfresh adventurer with copious material which has grown up during the\r\nprogress of this “history,” and which has been omitted only through lack\r\nof room. As far as my judgment has allowed me, I have selected what\r\nappeared best; other tastes might lead to other results. With this I\r\nwill take leave of a somewhat unpleasant and apparently egotistical\r\ntask; and in doing so beg to say that I trust to the reader’s kindness,\r\nand hope he will overlook the blemishes of a hurried and certainly an\r\nunpretentious work, which may, however, be found to contain a little\r\namusement and some amount of information.\r\n\r\n  H. S.\r\n\r\n  LONDON, _September 1874_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n  HISTORY OF ADVERTISING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_INTRODUCTORY--NEWSPAPERS AND NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be patent to every one who takes the least interest in the\r\nsubject, that the study of so important a branch of our present system\r\nof commerce as advertising, with its rise and growth, cannot fail to be\r\nfull of interest. Indeed it is highly suggestive of amusement, as a\r\nreference to any of our old newspapers, full as they are of quaint\r\nannouncements, untrammelled by the squeamishness of the present age,\r\nwill show. Advertising has, of course, within the last fifty years,\r\ndeveloped entirely new courses, and has become an institution differing\r\nmuch from the arrangement in which, so far as our references show, it\r\nfirst appeared in this country; its growth has been attended by an\r\nalmost entire revulsion of mode, and where we now get long or short\r\nannouncements by the hundred, dictated by a spirit of business, our\r\nfathers received statements couched in a style of pure romance, which\r\nfully compensated for their comparatively meagre proportions. Of course,\r\neven in the present day, and in the most pure-minded papers, ignorance,\r\nintolerance, and cupidity exhibit themselves frequently, often to the\r\namusement, but still more often to the annoyance and disgust, of\r\nthinkers; but in the good old days, when a spade was a spade, and when\r\npeople did not seek to gloss over their weaknesses and frivolities, as\r\nthey do now, by a pretence of virtue and coldness, which, after all,\r\nimposes only on the weak and credulous, advertisements gave a real\r\ninsight into the life of the people; and so, in the hope that our\r\nresearches will tend to dispel some of the mists which still hang over\r\nthe sayings and doings of folk who lived up to comparatively modern\r\ndays, we present this work to the curious reader.\r\n\r\nIt is generally assumed--though the assumption has no ground for\r\nexistence beyond that so common amongst us, that nothing exists of which\r\nwe are ignorant--that advertisements are of comparatively modern origin.\r\nThis idea has probably been fostered in the public mind by the fact that\r\nso little trouble has ever been taken by encyclopædists to discover\r\nanything about them; and as time begets difficulties in research, we are\r\nalmost driven to regard the first advertisement with which we are\r\nacquainted as the actual inaugurator of a system which now has hardly\r\nany bounds. That this is wrong will be shown most conclusively, and even\r\nso far evidence is given by the statement, made by Smith and others,\r\nthat advertisements were published in Greece and Rome in reference to\r\nthe gladiatorial exhibitions, so important a feature of the ancient days\r\nof those once great countries. That these advertisements took the form\r\nof what is now generally known as “billing,” seems most probable, and\r\nRome must have often looked like a modern country town when the advent\r\nof a circus or other travelling company is first made known.\r\n\r\nThe first newspaper supposed to have been published in England appeared\r\nin the reign of Queen Elizabeth during the Spanish Armada panic. This\r\njournal was called the _English Mercurie_, and was by authority\r\n“imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, Her Highnesses printer,\r\n1583.” This paper was said to be started for the prevention of the\r\nfulmination of false reports, but it was more like a succession of\r\nextraordinary gazettes, and had by no means the appearance of a regular\r\njournal, as we understand the term. It was promoted by Burleigh, and\r\nused by him to soothe, inform, or exasperate the people as occasion\r\nrequired.[1] Periodicals and papers really first came into general use\r\nduring the civil wars in the reign of Charles I., and in the time of the\r\nCommonwealth; in fact, each party had its organs, to disseminate\r\nsentiments of loyalty, or to foster a spirit of resistance against the\r\ninroads of power.[2] The country was accordingly overflowed with tracts\r\nof every size and of various denominations, many of them displaying\r\ngreat courage, and being written with uncommon ability. _Mercury_ was\r\nthe prevailing title, generally qualified with some epithet; and the\r\nquaintness peculiar to the age is curiously exemplified in the names of\r\nsome of the news-books, as they were called: the _Dutch Spye_, the\r\n_Scots Dove_, the _Parliament Kite_, the _Screech Owle_, and the\r\n_Parliamentary Screech Owle_, being instances in point. The list of\r\n_Mercuries_ is almost too full for publication. There was _Mercurius\r\nAcheronticus_, which brought tidings weekly from the infernal regions;\r\nthere was _Mercurius Democritus_, whose information was supposed to be\r\nderived from the moon; and among other _Mercuries_ there was the\r\n_Mercurius Mastix_, whose mission was to criticise all its namesakes. It\r\nwas not, however, until the reign of Queen Anne that a daily paper\r\nexisted in London--this was the _Daily Courant_, which occupied the\r\nfield alone for a long period, but which ultimately found two rivals in\r\nthe _Daily Post_ and the _Daily Journal_, the three being simultaneously\r\npublished in 1724. This state of things continued with very little\r\nchange during the reign of George I., but publications of every kind\r\nincreased abundantly during the reign of his successor. The number of\r\nnewspapers annually sold in England, according to an average of three\r\nyears ending with 1753, was 7,411,757; in 1760 it amounted to 9,464,790;\r\nin 1767 it rose to 11,300,980; in 1790 it was as high as 14,035,636; and\r\nin 1792 it amounted to 15,005,760. All this time advertising was a\r\ngrowing art, and advertisements were beginning to make themselves\r\nmanifest as the main support and chief source of profit of newspapers,\r\nas well as the most natural channel of communication between the buyers\r\nand sellers, the needing and supplying members of a vast community.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ^Numb. 49^\r\n\r\n  ^Domestick Intelligence,^\r\n  Or, News both from\r\n  CITY and COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n  ^Published to prevent false Reports.^\r\n\r\n  ^Tuesday^, _Decemb. 23. 1679_.\r\n\r\n  _London_ Decemb. 22.\r\n\r\n  LAst Friday being the nineteenth of this Instant _December_, the\r\n  Justices of the Peace of _Middlesex_ and _Westminster_ attended His\r\n  Majesty in Council, to receive Power and Instructions for the removal\r\n  of all Papists from the Cities of _London_ and _Westminster_, in\r\n  pursuance of His Majesties late Proclamation to that Purpose, and\r\n  being called in, there were Orders given them, to make strict search\r\n  for all _Papists_ that are His Majesties Subjects, or any other\r\n  _Popish_ Recusants who have not the Priviledge of continuing here, (in\r\n  _Sommerset_ House in the Absence of the Queen, as also in His\r\n  Majesties Palace at St. _Jame’s_,) and that the said Justices of the\r\n  Peace, shall seize and Imprison all that be found Transgressors of the\r\n  Law, and Condemners of His Majesties Authority. His Majesty hath also\r\n  sent Orders into the Countrey to the several Knights of the Shire, to\r\n  take an Exact List of the Names of all the Papists of any repute in\r\n  their Respective Counties, and to return the said List to the\r\n  Secretary of State, to be communicated to the Council, and that\r\n  thereupon such Effectual proceedings would be used against them as the\r\n  utmost Severity and Rigour of the Law will allow, and the said Lists\r\n  being accordingly returned to the Lords of the Committee appointed to\r\n  consider of the most Effectual means for putting the Laws in Execution\r\n  against Papists, and for the suppression of Popery (mentioned in our\r\n  last) the Lord Chancellor has order to prepare Commissions (in which\r\n  the said Lists are to be Inserted) which do Impower and require the\r\n  Justices of Peace of the several Counties in _England_ and _Wales_, to\r\n  tender the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy to all Persons mentioned\r\n  therein, and in case of their Denial to take the same, to proceed\r\n  against them according to Law, in order to their speedy Conviction;\r\n  with the said Commissions are also to be sent special Instructions for\r\n  the better direction of the said Justices therein, and also Letters\r\n  from the Council Board, to require and Encourage them diligently to\r\n  Execute the said Commissions, and to send up an Account of their\r\n  proceedings, as likewise the Names of all other Papists and Suspected\r\n  Papists as are not in the said Commissions, And that no Papist shall\r\n  be allowed a License or Dispensation to stay in Town; Further that a\r\n  List be taken of all House-keepers, and especially such as entertain\r\n  Lodgers within the Bills of Morality, and of all Midwives,\r\n  Apothecaries and Physicians that are Papists or suspected to be such,\r\n  and to return the List to the Council: And that no Papist may Harbour\r\n  in any of His Majesties Palaces, a Commission is ordered for the\r\n  Green-cloth to offer the Oaths of Allegiance, Supremacy and the Test\r\n  to all Papists and Suspected Papists as shall be found in _Whitehall_,\r\n  and the Precinct thereof, who upon refusal are to be proceeded against\r\n  according to Law, And the Messengers and Knight-Marshals men are\r\n  ordered to seize and bring them before the said Officers, and a Reward\r\n  of Ten pound is to be paid to those who shall discover any Papist or\r\n  suspected Papist in any of His Majesties Houses, and the Officer that\r\n  harbours them shall be turned out of his Place, and Imployment. And\r\n  the Officers of the Parishes, where Ambassadors and Forreign Ministers\r\n  reside shall have Lists brought them of their Menial Servants, and if\r\n  any others shall presume to resort to their _Popish_ Chappels they\r\n  shall be seized and prosecuted.\r\n\r\n  It hath been given out that _Francis Smith_ the Bookseller, was upon\r\n  the seventeenth of this Instant _December_, by order of the Council\r\n  Board, Committed to _Newgate_ for Printing the Association, and\r\n  Seditious Queries upon it, and Promoting _Tumultuous Petitions_, but\r\n  our last gave you a _True_ Account of his Committment as expelled in\r\n  the Warrant, and that he had brought his _Habeas Corpus_ upon the late\r\n  Act of Parliament, and we can now assure you that upon Friday the\r\n  Nineteenth Instant he was thereupon restored to his Liberty.\r\n\r\n  This day, _December 22._ was the Election (according to the Custom of\r\n  the City of _London_) of the Common-Council-men for the year ensuing,\r\n  and all good Protestants are abundantly satisfied, that those who are\r\n  chosen are such as will stedfastly adhere to the _Protestant_\r\n  Interest, and will upon all occasions assert their own, and the Rights\r\n  of this City.\r\n\r\n  The _Gazette_ having told you, That the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of\r\n  _London_, were directed by the Lord Chancellor, by His Majesties\r\n  Command, not to suffer such persons as should sign tumultous Petitions\r\n  to go unpunished, but that they should proceed against them, or cause\r\n  them to be brought before the Council Board to be punished as they\r\n  deserve, according to a Judgment of all the Judges of _England 2\r\n  Jacobi_, we suppose it may gratifie our Readers curiosity, (and\r\n  prevent this danger too) to see what the Law Books say therein. Judge\r\n  _Crook_ in his _Reports, folio 37._ saith, That by command from the\r\n  King, all the Justices of _England_, and divers of the Nobility, with\r\n  the Archbishop of _Canterbury_, and Bishop of _London_, were Assembled\r\n  in the _Star-chamber_, when the Lord Chancellor demanded of the\r\n  Judges, whether it were _an Offence_ punishable, and what punishment\r\n  they deserve, who framed _Petitions_, and Collected a multitude of\r\n  hands thereto, to present to the King in a publick cause, as the\r\n  _Puritans_ had done, (_which was as it seems for Alteration of the\r\n  Law_ (with an intimation to the King, that if he denied their Suit,\r\n  many _Thousands_ of his Subjects would be _discontented_;) whereto all\r\n  the Justices answered, “That it was an Offence fineable at\r\n  _Discretion_, and very near Treason and _Fellony_, in the punishment,\r\n  for they tended to the Raising of Sedition, Rebellion, and Discontent\r\n  among the People,” To which Resolution all the Lords agreed, and then\r\n  many of the Lords declared that some of the _Puritans_ had raised a\r\n  false Rumor of the King, how he intended to to grant a Toleration to\r\n  _Papists_, which offence the Justices conceived to be highly fineable\r\n  by the Rules of the Common Law, either in the Kings Bench, _or by the\r\n  King and his Council_, or now since the Statute of the 3. _Henry_ 7.\r\n  in the _Star-chamber_, The Lords severally, declared how the King was\r\n  discontented with the said false Rumor, and had made but the day\r\n  before a Protestation unto them, _That he never Intended it, and that\r\n  he would spend the last Drop of Blood in his body before he would do\r\n  it, and prayed that before any of his issue should maintain any other\r\n  Religion then what he truly professed and maintained, that God would\r\n  take them out of the world_.\r\n\r\n  There were Eleven Persons Condemned to dye the last Sessions in the\r\n  _Old Baily_, six Men and five Women, but one man and three women\r\n  received a Gracious Reprieve from His Majesty, the other seven\r\n  suffered at _Tyburn_ upon _Friday_ last the Nineteenth Instant, whose\r\n  Names and Crimes follow, _John Parker_ by Trade a Watchmaker, for\r\n  Clipping and Coining, having been formerly Convicted of the like at\r\n  _Salisbury_; _Benjamin Penry_, a lusty stout man, convicted of being a\r\n  Notorious Highway-man, and Companion with _French_ Executed last\r\n  Sessions; _John Dell_, who with _Richard Dean_, his Servant were\r\n  heretofore Tryed, for the Murder of _Dells_ wives Brother, and now of\r\n  his wife, which seemed rather to want Proof then Truth, they were both\r\n  Condemned for stealing a Mare, and Executed for the same; This _Dean_\r\n  set fire of the Room wherein he lay at two Places the Night before he\r\n  was Executed; _William Atkins_ for Fellony, being an old Trader in\r\n  that way; The two women, _Susan White_, and _Deborah Rogers_ were both\r\n  old Offenders.\r\n\r\n  The Right Honourable the Earl of _Shaftesbury_ hath been lately ill,\r\n  but is pretty well recovered to the Joy of all Good _Protestants_.\r\n\r\n  From _Holland_ they write, That there are some hopes of a League\r\n  Offensive and Defensive between His Majesty and the _States General_\r\n  of the _United Provinces_, but on the contrary many fear that a League\r\n  will be concluded between the said _States_, and the _French_ King.\r\n\r\n  The Report of the Death of the Dutchess of _Cleaveland_ is altogether\r\n  false and groundless, she having not been indisposed of late.\r\n\r\n  Mr. _Benjamin Claypool_ attended the Council again upon Fryday last,\r\n  and was discharged from the custody of the Messenger being told that\r\n  his word should be taken for his Appearance when he should be\r\n  summoned.\r\n\r\n  Mr. _Mason_ Attended the Council about writing News Letters, and\r\n  entred into Recognizance to appear after the Holidays, upon which he\r\n  was discharged from the custody of the Messenger.\r\n\r\n  Captain _Sharp_ attended upon summons for erecting some buildings upon\r\n  _Tower-hill_, and was ordered to produce all his Deeds and Records to\r\n  the Attorney General, who is to Inspect them and make a Report thereof\r\n  to the Council Board.\r\n\r\n  For the readier dispatch of Affairs, there are three Committees sit\r\n  this day _December_, the 22th. at _Whitehall_, one about _Jamaica_,\r\n  Another concerning Trade and the Forreign Plantations, and a Third\r\n  about _Tangier_, to which place we hear there is order for sending\r\n  more Forces and Provisions, for the reinforcing that Garrison, and\r\n  preventing any danger that may arise from the _Moors_. We hear further\r\n  from thence that there are several persons who were formerly _Roman_\r\n  Catholicks, and amongst the rest Captain St. _Johns_, _Captain\r\n  Talbut_, and one Mr. _White_ since made a Captain, with divers\r\n  _others_ who have freely and voluntarily renounced the said Religion,\r\n  and are become _Protestants_, having received the Sacrament according\r\n  to the usage of the Church of _England_, the chief motive of their\r\n  conversion proceeding from their conviction of the Horrid Principles\r\n  and the bloody Trayterous; and damnable practises of the _Popish_\r\n  Faction, and especially since the discovery of the Hellish _Popish_\r\n  Plot against His Majesties Person, the Protestant Religion, and for\r\n  enslaving the Kingdom.\r\n\r\n  There is a Report that three Suns were lately seen about _Richmond_ in\r\n  _Surrey_, by divers credible persons, of which different observations\r\n  are made according to the fancy of the People.\r\n\r\n  This day, Decemb. 22. Captain _William Bedlow_ one of the Kings\r\n  Evidence, who has been so instrumental in discovering the _Hellish\r\n  Popish_ Plot, and thereby (under God) for preserving his Majesties\r\n  Person and the whole Nation, was married to a Lady of a very\r\n  considerable Fortune.\r\n\r\n  There being Intimation given, that _Mrs._ Celier the _Popish_ Midwife\r\n  now a Prisoner in _Newgate_, would make some Discovery of the Plot,\r\n  and the Counter Plot; _She_ was brought before the Councill last week,\r\n  but would confess nothing; whereupon Justice _Warcup_ produced some\r\n  information against her taken before him; Upon which she acknowledged\r\n  the greatest part of what was charged against her, and thereby gave\r\n  very strong Confirmation to the Truth of Mr. _Thomas Dangerfields_\r\n  Depositions, concerning that cursed Conspiracy managed by the Lady\r\n  _Powis_, herself, and several others, for the destruction of many\r\n  Hundreds of his Majesties Loyal _Protestant_ Subjects.\r\n\r\n  It is reported, that a Quaker fell in love with a Lady of very great\r\n  Quality, and hath extraordinarily petitioned to obtain her for his\r\n  Wife.\r\n\r\n  Upon the 17th. instant in the evening Mr. _Dryden_ the great Poet, was\r\n  set upon in _Rose-street_ in _Covent Garden_, by three persons, who\r\n  calling him rogue, and Son of a whore, knockt him down and dangerously\r\n  wounded him, but upon his crying out murther, they made their escape;\r\n  it is conceived that they had their pay beforehand, and designed not\r\n  to rob him but to execute on him some _Feminine_, if not _Popish_\r\n  vengeance.\r\n\r\n  Mr. _Stretch_ the _Custome-house_ Waiter, who seized the Papers in\r\n  Colonel _Mansells_ lodgings, and was soon after suspended from his\r\n  place, upon his humble _Petition_ to His Majesty, was yesterday\r\n  restored.\r\n\r\n  In pursuance of His Majesties most strict order for the removing all\r\n  _Papists_ and Suspected _Papists_, from his Palace, the Dutchess of\r\n  _Portsmouths_ Servants that are of the _Romish_ Church are discharged.\r\n\r\n  It hath pleased His Majesty to take from His Grace the Duke of\r\n  _Monmouth_, the Office of the Master of the Horse, that being the only\r\n  place which remained to him; but we know not yet who shall succeed\r\n  him, and the Earl of _Feversham_ is made Master of the Horse to the\r\n  Queen.\r\n\r\n  Advertisements.\r\n\r\n  _THESE are to give Notice That the Right Honourable the Lord_ Maior,\r\n  _and the Commissioners of Serveyors for the City of_ London, _and the\r\n  Liberties thereof; have constituted and appointed_ Samuel Potts _and_\r\n  Robert Davies, _Citizens; to be the General Rakers of the said City\r\n  and Liberties, and do keep their Office in Red Lyon Court, in_\r\n  Watling-street, _where any Person or Persons that are desirous to be\r\n  Imployed under them, as Carters and Sweepers of the Streets, may\r\n  repair from Eight a Clock in the morning, till Twelve a Clock at noon,\r\n  and from two till six at night, where they may be entertained\r\n  accordingly: And if any Gardners, Farmers or others will be furnisht\r\n  with any Dung Soyl or Compost, may there agree for it at reasonable\r\n  rates; and all Gentlemen having private Stables, and all Inholders and\r\n  Masters of Livery Stables and all others, are desired to repair\r\n  thither for the carrying away of their Dung and Soil from their\r\n  respective Stables, and other places, according to an Act of Common\r\n  Council for that purpose._\r\n\r\n  _THERE is newly published a Pack of Cards, containing an History of\r\n  all the_ Popish _Plots that have been in_ England: _beginning with\r\n  those in Queen_ Elizabeth _time, and ending with this last damnable\r\n  plot against his Majesty_ Charles II: _Excellently engraved on Copper\r\n  Plates, with very larg descriptions under each Card.

This was\r\ncalled the _Mercurius Politicus_, and appeared at Leith in October 1653;\r\nbut it was in November 1654 transferred to Edinburgh, where it was\r\ncontinued until the 11th April 1660, when it was rechristened, and\r\nappeared as the _Mercurius Publicus_. This paper was but a reprint, for\r\nthe information of the English soldiers, of a London publication. But a\r\nnewspaper of native manufacture, we are told by a contemporary writer,\r\nsoon made its appearance under the title of _Mercurius Caledonius_. The\r\nfirst number of this was published at Edinburgh on the 31st December\r\n1660, and comprised, as its title sets forth, “the affairs in agitation\r\nin Scotland, with a summary of foreign intelligence.” The publication,\r\nhowever, extended to no more than ten numbers, which, it is said by\r\nChambers, “were very loyal, very illiterate, and very affected.” After\r\nthe Revolution the custom was still to reprint in Scotland the papers\r\npublished in London, an economic way of doing business, which savours\r\nmuch of the proverbial thrift peculiar to the Land o’ Cakes. In February\r\n1699 the _Edinburgh Gazette_, the first original Scotch newspaper or\r\nperiodical, was published by James Watson, author of a “History of\r\nPrinting;” but he, after producing forty numbers, transferred it to a Mr\r\nJohn Reid, whose son continued to print the paper till even after the\r\nUnion. In February 1705, Watson, who seems to have been what would now\r\nbe called a promoter of newspapers, established the _Edinburgh Courant_,\r\nbut relinquished it after the publication of fifty-five numbers, and in\r\nSeptember 1706 commenced the _Scots Courant_, with which he remained\r\nconnected until about 1718. To these papers were added in October 1708\r\nthe _Edinburgh Flying Post_; in August 1709 the _Scots Postman_,\r\n“printed by David Fearne for John Moncur;” and in March 1710 the _North\r\nTatler_, “printed by John Reid for Samuel Colvil.” In 1715 the\r\nfoundation was laid of the present splendid Glasgow press by the\r\nestablishment of the _Courant_, but this did not in any way affect the\r\npublications in the then far more important town of Edinburgh. In March\r\n1714 Robert Brown commenced the _Edinburgh Gazette_ or _Scots Postman_,\r\nwhich was published twice a week; and in December 1718 the Town Council\r\ngave an exclusive privilege to James M‘Ewen to publish three times a\r\nweek the _Edinburgh Evening Courant_, upon condition, however, that\r\nbefore publication “the said James should give ane coppie of his print\r\nto the magistrates.” This journal is still published, and it is but fair\r\nto assume that the original stipulation is yet complied with. The\r\n_Caledonian Mercury_ followed the _Courant_ on the 28th of April 1720,\r\nand was, like its forerunner, a tri-weekly organ. In these, as well as\r\nin those we have mentioned, advertisements slowly but gradually and\r\nsurely began to make their appearance, and, as the sequel proves, to\r\nshow their value.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by several writers that the earliest English provincial\r\nnewspaper is believed to be the _Norwich Postman_, which was published\r\nin 1706 at the price of a penny, and which bore the quaint statement,\r\nthat a halfpenny would not be refused. Newspaper proprietors,\r\npublishers, and editors were then evidently, so far as Norwich is\r\nconcerned, less strong than they are now in their own conceit, and in\r\ntheir belief in the press as an organ of great power. This _Postman_ was\r\nfollowed in 1714 by the _Norwich Courant_ or _Weekly Packet_. York and\r\nLeeds followed in 1720, Manchester in 1730, and Oxford in 1740. It was\r\nnot, however, until advertising became an important branch of commercial\r\nspeculation that the provincial press began in any way to flourish. Now\r\nthe journals published in our largest country towns command extensive\r\ncirculations, and are regarded by many advertising agents, whose\r\nopinions are fairly worth taking, as being much more remunerative media\r\nthan our best London papers. For certain purposes, and under certain\r\ncircumstances, the same may be said of colonial newspapers, which have,\r\nof course, grown up with the colonies in which they are published; for\r\nit must be always borne in mind that the essence of advertising is to\r\nplace your statement where it is most likely to be seen by those most\r\ninterested in it, and so a newspaper with a very limited supply of\r\nreaders indeed is often more valuable to the advertiser of peculiar\r\nwares or wants than one with “the largest circulation in the world,” if\r\nthat circulation does not reach the class of readers most affected by\r\nthose who pay for publicity. It would seem, however, that the largest\r\nclass of advertisers, the general public, who employ no agents, and who\r\nconsider a large sale everything that is necessary, ignore the argument\r\nof the true expert, and lose sight of the fact that, no matter how\r\nextensive a circulation may be, it is intrinsically useless unless\r\nflowing through the channel which is fairly likely to effect the purpose\r\nfor which the advertisement is inserted. It is customary to see a sheet,\r\ndetached from the paper with which it is issued, full of advertisements,\r\nwhich are, of course, unread by all but those who are professedly\r\nreaders of public announcements, and who are also, of course, not only\r\nin a decided minority, but not at all the people to whom the notices are\r\ngenerally directed. The smallest modicum of thought will show how\r\ngrievous is the error which leads to such a result, and how much better\r\nit is to regard actual circulation but as so much evidence as to the\r\nvalue of an advertisement only, and not as a whole, sole, and complete\r\nqualification. Not in any incautious way do those who are most qualified\r\nto judge of value for money act. Turn to any paper of repute, and it\r\nwill be seen that the professional advertiser, the theatrical manager,\r\nthe publisher, the auctioneer, and the others whom constant practice\r\nhas made wary, lay out their money on quite a different principle from\r\nthat of the casual advertiser. They have learned their lesson, and if\r\nthey pay extra for position or insertion, they know that their outlay is\r\nremunerative; whereas, if it were not governed by caution and system, it\r\nwould be simply ruinous. In fact, advertising is a most expensive luxury\r\nif not properly regulated, and a most valuable adjunct when coolness and\r\ncalculation are brought to bear upon it as accessories.\r\n\r\nThe heavy duties originally imposed upon newspapers, both on them and\r\ntheir advertisements, were at first a considerable check to the number\r\nof notices appearing in them. For, in the first place, the high price of\r\nthe papers narrowed the limits of their application; and, in the second,\r\nthe extra charge on the advertisements made them above the reach of\r\nalmost all but those who were themselves possessed of means, or whose\r\nbusiness it was to pander to the unholy and libidinous desires of the\r\nwealthy. This, we fancy, will be extensively proved by a reference to\r\nthe following pages; for while it is our endeavour to keep from this\r\nbook all really objectionable items, we are desirous that it shall place\r\nbefore the reader a true picture of the times in which the\r\nadvertisements appeared; and we are not to be checked in our duty by any\r\nfalse delicacy, or turned from the true course by any squeamishness,\r\nwhich, unfortunately for us in these days, but encourages the vices it\r\nattempts to ignore.\r\n\r\nThe stamp duty on newspapers was first imposed in 1713, and was one\r\nhalfpenny for half a sheet or less, and one penny “if larger than half a\r\nsheet and not exceeding a whole sheet.” This duty was increased a\r\nhalfpenny by an Act of Parliament, 30 Geo. II. c. 19; and by another\r\nAct, 16 Geo. III. c. 34, another halfpenny was added to the tax. This\r\nnot being considered sufficient, a further addition of a halfpenny was\r\nmade (29 Geo. III. c. 50), and in the thirty-seventh year of the same\r\nwise monarch’s reign (c. 90) three-halfpence more was all at once placed\r\nto the debit of newspaper readers, which brought the sum total of the\r\nduty up to fourpence. An Act of 6 & 7 Will. IV. c. 76 reduced this duty\r\nto one penny, with the proviso, however, that when the sheet contained\r\n1550 superficial inches on either side, an extra halfpenny was to be\r\npaid, and when it contained 2295, an extra penny. An additional\r\nhalfpenny was also charged on a supplement, which may be regarded, when\r\nthe use of supplements in the present day is taken into consideration,\r\nas an indirect tax on advertisements. In 1855, by an Act 18 & 19 Vict.\r\nc. 27, this stamp duty was abolished, and immediately an immense number\r\nof newspapers started into existence, most of which, however, obtained\r\nbut a most ephemeral being, and died away, leaving no sign. There are,\r\nhowever, a large number of good and useful papers still flourishing,\r\nwhich would never have been published but for the repeal of the\r\nnewspaper stamp duty. To such repeal many rich men owe their prosperity,\r\nwhile to the same source may now be ascribed the poverty of numbers who\r\nwere once affluent. At this time, of course, the old papers also reduced\r\ntheir rates, and from thence has grown a system of newspaper reading and\r\nadvertising which twenty years ago could hardly have been imagined. Up\r\nto the repeal of the stamp duty few people bought newspapers for\r\nthemselves, and many newsvendors’ chief duty was to lend the _Times_ out\r\nfor a penny per hour, while a second or third day’s newspaper was\r\nconsidered quite a luxury by those whom business or habit compelled to\r\nstay at home, and therefore who were unable to glance over the\r\nnews--generally while some impatient person was scowlingly waiting his\r\nturn--at the tavern bar or the coffee-house. Now almost every one buys a\r\npenny paper for himself, and with the increase in the circulation of\r\nnewspapers has, in proportionate ratio, gone on the increase in the\r\ndemand for advertisements. The supply has, as every one knows, been in\r\nno way short of the demand. The repeal of the paper duty in 1861 also\r\naffected newspapers much, though naturally in a smaller degree than the\r\nabolition of the compulsory stamp. Still the effect on both the papers\r\nand their advertisements--especially as concerns those journals which\r\nwere enabled to still farther reduce their rates--was considerable, and\r\ndeserves to be noted. In September 1870 the compulsory stamp, which had\r\nbeen retained for postal purposes, was abolished, and on the 1st of\r\nOctober papers were first sent by post with a halfpenny stamp affixed on\r\nthe wrappers, and not on the journals themselves.\r\n\r\nBut it was to the abolition of the impost upon advertisements that their\r\npresent great demand and importance can be most directly traced. For\r\nmany years a very heavy tax was charged upon every notice published in a\r\npaper and paid for, until 1833 no less than 3s. 6d. being chargeable\r\nupon each advertisement inserted, no matter what its length or\r\nsubject-matter. People then, we should imagine--in fact, as application\r\nto the papers of that time proves--were not so fond of cutting a long\r\nadvertisement into short and separate pieces as they are now, for every\r\ncut-off rule then meant a charge of 3s. 6d. In 1832, the last year of\r\nthis charge, the produce of this branch of the revenue in Great Britain\r\nand Ireland amounted to £170,649. Fancy what the returns would be if 3s.\r\n6d. were charged on every advertisement published throughout the United\r\nKingdom for the year ending December 31, 1873! It seems almost too great\r\na sum for calculation. There is no doubt, however, that many people\r\nwould be very glad to do the figures for a very slight percentage on the\r\nreturns, which would be fabulous, and which would, if properly\r\ncalculated, amaze many of those _laudatores temporis acti_ who, without\r\nreason or provocation, are always deploring the decay of everything, and\r\nwho would unhesitatingly affirm in their ignorance that even newspapers\r\nand newspaper advertisements have deteriorated in tone and quantity\r\nsince the good old times, of which they prove they know nothing by their\r\npersistent praises. Certainly if they did say this, they would not be\r\nmuch more wrong than they are generally when lamenting over a period\r\nwhich, could it but return, they would be, as a rule, the very first to\r\nobject to. Of the sum of £170,649 just referred to, about £127,986, or\r\nthree-fourths of the whole, may be regarded as being drawn from\r\nnewspapers, and the other fourth from periodical publications. In 1837,\r\nfour years after the reduced charge of 1s. 6d. for each advertisement\r\nhad become law, a table was compiled from the detailed returns of the\r\nfirst six months. As it will doubtless prove interesting to those who\r\ntake an interest in the growth and increase of newspapers, as well as in\r\nthose of advertisements, we append it:--\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------+-------+----------+-------+-------------+\r\n  |                          |No. of | No. of   | No. of|  Amount of  |\r\n  |                          |Papers.| Stamps.  | Adver-|Advertisement|\r\n  |                          |       |          | tise- |    Duty.    |\r\n  |                          |       |          | ments.|             |\r\n  +--------------------------+-------+----------+-------+-------------+\r\n  |London Papers,            |  93   |15,100,197|292,033|£21,902   9 6|\r\n  |English Provincial Papers,| 217   | 7,290,452|317,474| 23,810  11 0|\r\n  |Welsh Papers,             |  10   |   190,955|  6,499|    487   6 6|\r\n  |Edinburgh Papers,         |  13   |   768,071| 20,579|  1,543   9 6|\r\n  |Scotch Provincial Papers, |  46   | 1,121,658| 45,371|  3,402  16 8|\r\n  |Dublin Papers,            |  21   | 1,493,838| 45,848|  2,292   8 0|\r\n  |Irish Provincial Papers,  |  60   | 1,049,358| 41,284|  2,064   4 0|\r\n  |                          +-------+----------+-------+-------------+\r\n  |Total in Great Britain }  |       |          |       |             |\r\n  |  and Ireland,         }  | 460   |27,014,529|769,088|£55,503   5 2|\r\n  +--------------------------+-------+----------+-------+-------------+\r\n\r\nThe reduction to which we have alluded was followed in 1853 by the total\r\nabolition of the advertisement duty, the effect of which can be best\r\nappreciated by a glance at the columns of any daily or weekly paper,\r\nclass or general, which possesses a good circulation.\r\n\r\nThe first paper published in Ireland was a sheet called _Warranted\r\nTidings from Ireland_, and this appeared during the rebellion of 1641;\r\nbut the first Irish newspaper worthy of the name was the _Dublin\r\nNewsletter_, commenced in 1685. _Pue’s Occurrences_, a Dublin daily\r\npaper, originated in 1700, was continued for half a century, and was\r\nfollowed in 1728 by another daily paper, _Faulkner’s Journal_,\r\nestablished by one George Faulkner, “a man celebrated for the goodness\r\nof his heart and the weakness of his head.” The oldest existing Dublin\r\npapers are _Saunders’s_ (originally _Esdaile’s_) _Newsletter_, begun in\r\n1744, and the _Freeman’s Journal_, instituted under the title of the\r\n_Public Register_, by Dr Lucas in 1755. The _Limerick Chronicle_, the\r\noldest Irish provincial newspaper, dates from 1768. Ireland has now\r\nnearly 150 newspapers, most of them celebrated for the energy of their\r\nlanguage and the extreme fervour of their political opinions. Their\r\nConservatism and Liberalism are nearly equally divided; about a score\r\ntake independent views, and nearly fifty completely eschew politics.\r\nIrish newspapers flourish as vehicles for advertisement, and their\r\ntariffs are about on a par with those of our leading provincial\r\njournals.\r\n\r\nColonial newspapers are plentiful and good, and the best of them filled\r\nwith advertisements of a general character at fairly high rates. Those\r\npapers published in Melbourne are perhaps the best specimens of colonial\r\njournalism, and best among these are the _Argus_ and _Age_ (daily), and\r\nthe _Australasian_ and _Leader_ (weekly). In fact, we have hardly a\r\nweekly paper in London that is fit to compare on all-round merits with\r\nthe last-named, which is a complete representative of the best class of\r\nAustralian life, and contains a great show of advertisements, which do\r\nmuch to enlighten the reader as to Antipodean manners and customs.\r\n\r\nAmerican newspapers are of course plentiful, and their advertisements,\r\nas will be shown during the progress of this volume, are often of an\r\nalmost unique character. Throughout the United States, newspapers start\r\nup like rockets, to fall like sticks; but now and then a success is\r\nmade, and if once Fortune is secured by an adventurous speculator, she\r\nis rarely indeed allowed to escape. The system of work on American\r\n(U.S.) journals is very different from that pursued here, everything on\r\nsuch establishments as those of the _New York Herald_, the _Tribune_,\r\nand the _Times_, being sacrificed to news. This is more particularly the\r\ncase with regard to the _Herald_, which has an immense circulation and\r\ngreat numbers of highly-priced advertisements, most of which are\r\nunfortunately regarded more in connection with the amount of money they\r\nproduce to the proprietor than in reference to any effect, moral or\r\notherwise, they may have on the community. It is the boast of American\r\njournalists that they have papers in obscure towns many hundreds of\r\nmiles inland, any one of which contains in a single issue as much\r\nnews--news in the strictest meaning of the word--as the London _Times_\r\ndoes in six. And, singular as it may at first sight seem, there is a\r\ngreat element of truth about the statement, the telegraph being used in\r\nthe States with a liberality which would drive an English proprietor to\r\nthe depths of black despair. The Associated Telegraph Company seem to\r\nenjoy a monopoly, and to exercise almost unlimited powers; and not long\r\nago they almost completely ruined a journal of standing in California by\r\nrefusing to transmit intelligence to it because its editor and\r\nproprietor had taken exception to the acts of some members of the\r\nAssociated Telegraph Company’s staff, and it was only on receipt of a\r\nmost abject apology from the delinquents that the most autocratic power\r\nin the States decided to reinstate the paper on its list. This Telegraph\r\nCompany charges very high rates, and the only visible means by which\r\nthis system of journalism is successfully carried out is that of\r\nadvertisements, which are comparatively more plentiful in these papers\r\nthan in the English, and are charged for at considerably higher rates.\r\nSome of these newspapers, notably a small hebdomadal called the _San\r\nFrancisco Newsletter_, go in for a deliberate system of blackmailing,\r\nand have no hesitation in acknowledging that their pages, not the\r\nadvertisement portions, but their editorial columns, are to be bought\r\nfor any purpose--for the promotion of blasphemy, obscenity, atheism, or\r\nany other “notion”--at a price which is regulated according to the\r\neditor’s opinion of the former’s value, or the amount of money he may\r\nhave in his pocket at the time. This is a system of advertising little\r\nknown, happily, in this “effete old country,” where we have not yet\r\nlearned to sacrifice all that should be dear and honourable to\r\nhumanity--openly, at all events--for a money consideration. It is almost\r\nimpossible to tell the number of papers published throughout the United\r\nStates of America, each individual State being hardly aware of the\r\nquantity it contains, or how many have been born and died within the\r\ncurrent twelvemonths. The Americans are a truly great people, but they\r\nhave not yet settled down into a regular system, so far, at all events,\r\nas newspapers and advertisements are concerned.[3]\r\n\r\nThe first paper published in America is said to have been the _Boston\r\nNewsletter_, which made its appearance in 1704. The inhabitants of the\r\nUnited States have ever been wideawake to the advantages of advertising,\r\nbut it would seem that the Empire City is not, as is generally supposed\r\nhere, first in rank, so far as the speculative powers of its denizens\r\ngo, if we are to believe the New Orleans correspondent of the _New York\r\nTribune_, who says in one of his letters:--“The merchants of New\r\nOrleans are far more liberal in advertising than those of your city, and\r\nit is they alone which support most of our papers. One firm in this\r\ncity, in the drug business, expends 20,000 dollars a year in job\r\nprinting, and 30,000 dollars in advertising. A clothing firm has\r\nexpended 50,000 dollars in advertising in six months. Both\r\nestablishments are now enjoying the lion’s share of patronage, and are\r\ndetermined to continue such profits and investments. A corn doctor is\r\nadvertising at over 10,000 dollars a month, and the proprietor of a\r\n‘corner grocery’ on the outskirts of the city has found it advantageous\r\nto advertise to the extent of 7000 dollars during the past winter.”\r\n\r\nIn London the _Times_ and _Telegraph_ absorb the lion’s share of the\r\nadvertiser’s money. The former, the leading journal of the day, of\r\nindependent politics and magnificent proportions, stands forth first,\r\nand, to use a sporting phrase, has no second, so far is it in front of\r\nall others as regards advertisements, as well as on other grounds. An\r\naverage number of the _Times_ contains about 2500 advertisements,\r\ncounting between every cut-off rule; and the receipts in the\r\nadvertisement department are said to be about £1000 a day, or 8s. each.\r\nA number of the _Daily Telegraph_ in December 1873 contains 1444\r\nadvertisements (also counting between every cut-off rule), and these may\r\nfairly be calculated to produce £500 or thereabouts, the tariff being\r\nthroughout little less than that of the _Times_; for what it lacks in\r\npower and influence the _Telegraph_ is supposed to make up in\r\ncirculation. This is rather a change for the organ of Peterborough\r\nCourt, which little more than eighteen years ago was started with good\r\nadvertisements to the extent of _seven shillings and sixpence_. The\r\n_Telegraph_ proprietors do not, however, get all the profit out of the\r\nadvertisements, for in its early and struggling days they were glad,\r\nnaturally, to close with advertisement agents, who agreed to take so\r\nmany columns a day at the then trade price, and who now have a vast\r\ndeal the best of the bargain. To such lucky accidents, which occur often\r\nin the newspaper world, are due the happy positions of some men, who\r\nlive upon the profits accruing from their columns, and ride in neat\r\nbroughams, oblivious of the days when they went canvassing afoot, and\r\nhave almost brought themselves to the belief that they are gentlemen,\r\nand always were such. This must be the only bitter drop in the cup of\r\nthe otherwise happy possessors of the _Telegraph_, which is at once a\r\nmine of wealth to them, and an instrument by which they become quite a\r\npower in the state. They can, however, well afford the lucky\r\nadvertisement-agents their profits, and, looking back, may rest\r\nsatisfied that things are as they are.\r\n\r\nBut there are many daily papers in London besides the _Times_ and\r\n_Telegraph_, and all these receive a plentiful share of advertisements.\r\nThe _Standard_ has, within the past few years, developed its resources\r\nwonderfully, and may be now considered a good fair third in the race for\r\nwealth, and not by any means a distant third, so far as the _Telegraph_\r\nis concerned. This paper has a most extensive circulation, being the\r\nonly cheap Conservative organ in London, if we may except the _Hour_,\r\nand as it offers to advertisers a repetition of their notices in the\r\n_Evening Standard_, it is not surprising that, spacious as are its\r\nadvertisement columns, it manages to fill them constantly, and at a rate\r\nwhich would have considerably astonished its old proprietors. The _Daily\r\nNews_, which a few years back reduced its price to one penny, has, since\r\nthe Franco-Prussian war, been picking up wonderfully, and with its\r\nincreased health as a paper its outer columns have proportionally\r\nimproved in appearance; many experienced advertisers have a great regard\r\nfor the _News_, which they look upon as offering a good return for\r\ninvestments. The _Morning Advertiser_, as the organ of the licensed\r\nvictuallers, is of course an invaluable medium of inter-communication\r\namong members of “the trade,” and in it are to be found advertisements\r\nof everything to be obtained in connection with the distillery, the\r\nbrewery, and the tavern. Publicans who want potboys, and potboys who\r\nwant employers, barmaids, barmen, and people in want of “snug”\r\nbusinesses, or with “good family trades” to dispose of, all consult the\r\n_’Tiser_, which is under the special supervision of a committee of\r\nlicensed victuallers, who act as stewards, and annually hand over the\r\nprofits to the Licensed Victuallers’ School. An important body is this\r\ncommittee, a body which feels that the eye of Europe is upon it, and\r\nwhich therefore takes copious notes of everything; is broad wideawake,\r\nand is not to be imposed on. But it is a kindly and beneficent body, as\r\nits purpose shows; and a little licence can well be afforded to a\r\ncommittee which gives its time and trouble, to say nothing of voting its\r\nmoney, in the interest of the widow and the fatherless. A few years back\r\ngreat fun used to be got out of the _’Tiser_, or the “Gin and Gospel\r\nGazette,” as it was called, on account of its peculiar views on current\r\nquestions; but all that is altered now, and since the advent of the\r\npresent régime the _Advertiser_ has improved sufficiently to be regarded\r\nas a general paper, and therefore as a general advertising medium. The\r\n_Hour_ is a new journal, started in opposition to the _Standard_, and\r\nprofessing the same politics. It is hardly within our ken so far, and\r\nthe same may be said of the _Morning Post_, which has its own exclusive\r\n_clientèle_. In referring to the foregoing journals, we have made no\r\nremarks beyond those to which we are guided by their own published\r\nstatements, and we have intended nothing invidious in the order of\r\nselection. For obvious reasons we shall say nothing of the evening\r\npapers, beyond that all seem to fill their advertisement columns with\r\nease, and to be excellent mediums of publicity.\r\n\r\nThe weekly press and the provincial press can tell their own story\r\nwithout assistance. In the former the advertisements are fairly classed,\r\naccording to the pretensions of the papers or the cause they adopt,\r\nwhile with the provincials it is the story of the London dailies told\r\nover again. Manchester and Liverpool possess magnificent journals, full\r\nof advertisements and of large circulation, and so do all other large\r\ntowns in the country; but we doubt much if, out of London, Glasgow is to\r\nbe beaten on the score of its papers or the energy of its advertisers.\r\n\r\n  [1] This paper seems to have been an imposture, which, believed in at\r\n  the time, has been comparatively recently detected. A writer in the\r\n  _Quarterly Review_, June 1855, says, “The _English Mercurie_ of 1588\r\n  [Qy. 1583], which professes to have been published during those\r\n  momentous days when the Spanish Armada was hovering and waiting to\r\n  pounce upon our southern shores, contains amongst its items of news\r\n  three or four book advertisements, and these would undoubtedly have\r\n  been the first put forth in England, were that newspaper genuine. Mr\r\n  Watts, of the British Museum, has, however, proved that the several\r\n  numbers of this journal to be found in our national library are gross\r\n  forgeries; and, indeed, the most inexperienced eye in such matters can\r\n  easily see that neither their type, paper, spelling, nor composition\r\n  are much more than one instead of upwards of two centuries and a half\r\n  old.” Haydn also says, “Some copies of a publication are in existence\r\n  called the _English Mercury_, professing to come out under the\r\n  authority of Queen Elizabeth in 1588, the period of the Spanish\r\n  Armada. The researches of Mr J. Watts, of the British Museum, have\r\n  proved these to be forgeries, executed about 1766. The full title of\r\n  No. 50 is ‘_The English Mercurie_, published by authoritie, for the\r\n  prevention of false reports, imprinted by Christopher Barker, Her\r\n  Highnesses printer, No. 50.’ It describes the Spanish Armada, giving\r\n  ‘A journal of what passed since the 21st of this month, between Her\r\n  Majestie’s fleet and that of Spayne, transmitted by the Lord Highe\r\n  Admiral to the Lordes of Council.’”\r\n\r\n  [2] The _Quarterly_ mentions a paper which appeared late in the reign\r\n  of James I.: “The _Weekly News_, published in London in 1622, was the\r\n  first publication which answered to this description; it contained,\r\n  however, only a few scraps of foreign intelligence, and was quite\r\n  destitute of advertisements.” And then, as if to prove what has been\r\n  already stated by the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, the writer goes on to\r\n  say, “The terrible contest of the succeeding reign was the hotbed\r\n  which forced the press of this country into sudden life and\r\n  extraordinary vigour.”\r\n\r\n  [3] In 1830 America (U.S.), whose population was 23,500,000, supported\r\n  800 newspapers, 50 of these being daily; and the conjoined annual\r\n  circulation was 64,000,000. Fifteen years later these figures were\r\n  considerably increased--nearly doubled; but since the development of\r\n  the Pacific States it has been almost impossible to tell the number of\r\n  papers which have sprung into existence, every mining camp and every\r\n  village being possessed of its organ, some of which have died, and\r\n  some of which are still flourishing. A professed and apparently\r\n  competent critic assures us that there are quite 3000 newspapers now\r\n  in the States, and that at least a tithe of them are dailies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_INTRODUCTORY--STREET AND GENERAL ADVERTISING._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems indeed singular that we are obliged to regard advertising as a\r\ncomparatively modern institution; for, as will be shown in the progress\r\nof this work, the first advertisement which can be depended upon as\r\nbeing what it appears to be was, so far as can be discovered, published\r\nnot much more than two hundred years ago. But though we cannot find any\r\ninstances of business notices appearing in papers before the middle of\r\nthe seventeenth century, mainly because there were not, so far as our\r\nknowledge goes, papers in which to advertise, there is little doubt that\r\nthe desire among tradesmen and merchants to make good their wares has\r\nhad an existence almost as long as the customs of buying and selling,\r\nand it is but natural to suppose that advertisements in some shape or\r\nform have existed not only from time immemorial, but almost for all\r\ntime. Signs over shops and stalls seem naturally to have been the first\r\nefforts in the direction of advertisements, and they go back to the\r\nremotest portions of the world’s history. Public notices also were\r\nposted about in the first days of the children of Israel, the utterances\r\nof the kings and prophets being inscribed on parchments and exposed in\r\nthe high places of the cities. It was also customary, early in the\r\nChristian era, for a scroll to be exhibited when any of the Passion or\r\nother sacred plays were about to be performed, and comparatively\r\nrecently we have received positive intelligence that in Pompeii and\r\nsimilar places advertising by means of signs and inscriptions was quite\r\ncommon. The “History of Signboards,” a very exhaustive and valuable\r\nbook, quotes Aristotle, and refers to Lucian, Aristophanes, and others,\r\nin proof of the fact that signboard advertisements were used in ancient\r\nGreece, but the information is extremely vague. Of the Romans, however,\r\nmore is known. Some streets were with them known by means of signs. The\r\nbook referred to tells us that the bush, the Romans’ tavern sign, gave\r\nrise to the proverb, “Vino vendibili suspensa hedera non opus est;” and\r\nhence we derive our own sign of the bush, and our proverb, “Good wine\r\nneeds no bush.” An _ansa_ or handle of a pitcher was then the sign of a\r\npothouse, and hence establishments of this kind were afterwards\r\ndenominated _ansæ_.\r\n\r\nA correspondent writing to _Notes and Queries_, in answer to a question\r\nin reference to early advertising, says that the mode adopted by the\r\nHebrews appears to have been chiefly by word of mouth, not by writing.\r\nHence the Hebrew word _kara_ signifies to cry aloud, and to announce or\r\nmake known publicly (κηρύσσειν); and the announcement or proclamation,\r\nas a matter of course, was usually made in the streets and chief places\r\nof concourse. The matters thus proclaimed were chiefly of a sacred kind,\r\nas might be expected under a theocracy; and we have no evidence that\r\nsecular affairs were made the subject of similar announcements. In one\r\ninstance, indeed (Isa. xiii. 3), _kara_ has been supposed to signify the\r\ncalling out of troops; but this may be doubted. The Greeks came a step\r\nnearer to our idea of advertising, for they made their public\r\nannouncements by writing as well as orally. For announcement by word of\r\nmouth they had their κήρυξ, who, with various offices besides, combined\r\nthat of public crier. His duties as crier appear to have been\r\nrestricted, with few exceptions, to state announcements and to great\r\noccasions. He gave notice, however, of sales. For the publication of\r\ntheir laws the Greeks employed various kinds of tablets, πίνακες,\r\nἄξονες, κύρβεις. On these the laws were written, to be displayed for\r\npublic inspection. The Romans largely advertised private as well as\r\npublic matters, and by writing as well as by word of mouth. They had\r\ntheir _præcones_, or criers, who not only had their public duties, but\r\nannounced the times, places, and conditions of sales, and cried things\r\nlost. Hawkers cried their own goods. Thus Cicero speaks of one who cried\r\nfigs, _Cauneas clamitabat_ (De Divin. ii. 40). But the Romans also\r\nadvertised, in a stricter sense of the term, by writing. The bills were\r\ncalled _libelli_, and were used for advertising sales of estates, for\r\nabsconded debtors, and for things lost or found. The advertisements were\r\noften written on tablets (_tabellæ_), which were affixed to pillars\r\n(_pilæ columnæ_). On the walls of Pompeii have been discovered various\r\nadvertisements. There will be a dedication or formal opening of certain\r\nbaths. The company attending are promised slaughter of wild beasts,\r\nathletic games, perfumed sprinkling, and awnings to keep off the sun\r\n(_venatia_, _athletæ_, _sparsiones_, _vela_).[4] One other mode of\r\npublic announcement employed by the Romans should be mentioned, and that\r\nwas by signs suspended or painted on the wall. Thus a suspended shield\r\nserved as the sign of a tavern (Quintil. vi. 3), and nuisances were\r\nprohibited by the painting of two sacred serpents. Among the French,\r\nadvertising appears to have become very general towards the close of the\r\nsixteenth century. In particular, placards attacking private character\r\nhad, in consequence of the religious wars, become so numerous and\r\noutrageous, that subsequently, in 1652, the Government found it\r\nnecessary to interpose for their repression.[5]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the signs of Herculaneum and Pompeii, the “History of\r\nSignboards” says that a few were painted, but, as a rule, they appear to\r\nhave been made of stone, or terra cotta relievo, and set into the\r\npilasters at the sides of the open shop fronts. Thus there have been\r\nfound a goat, the sign of a dairy, and a mule driving a mill, the sign\r\nof a baker. At the door of a school was the highly suggestive and not\r\nparticularly pleasant sign to pupils of a boy being birched. Like to our\r\nown signs of two brewers carrying a tun slung on a pole, a Pompeian\r\npublican had two slaves represented above his door carrying an amphora,\r\nand another dispenser of drink had a painting of Bacchus pressing a\r\nbunch of grapes. At a perfumer’s shop in the street of Mercury were\r\nrepresented various items of that profession, notably four men carrying\r\na box with vases of perfume, and men laying out and perfuming a corpse.\r\nThere was also a sign of the Two Gladiators, under which, in the usual\r\nPompeian cacography, was the following:--“Abiam venerem Pompeiianama\r\niradam qui hoc læserit.” Besides these were the signs of the Anchor, the\r\nShip (possibly a ship-chandler’s), a sort of a Cross, the Chequers, the\r\nPhallus on a baker’s shop, with the words, “Hic habitat felicitas;”\r\nwhilst in Herculaneum there was a very cleverly painted Amorino, or\r\nCupid, carrying a pair of lady’s shoes, one on his head and the other in\r\nhis hand. It is also probable that the various artificers of Rome used\r\ntheir tools as signs over their workshops and residences, as it is found\r\nthat they were sculptured on their tombs in the catacombs. On the\r\ntombstone of Diogenes, the grave-digger, there is a pickaxe and a lamp;\r\nBanto and Maxima have the tools of carpenters, a saw, an adze, and a\r\nchisel; Veneria, a tire-woman, has a mirror and a comb. There are others\r\nwith wool-combers’ implements; a physician has a cupping-glass; a\r\npoulterer, a case of fowls; a surveyor, a measuring rule; a baker, a\r\nbushel measure, a millstone, and some ears of corn; and other signs are\r\nnumerous on the graves of the departed. Even the modern custom of\r\npunning on the name, so common on signboards, finds its precedent on\r\nthese stones. The grave of Dracontius was embellished with a dragon,\r\nthat of Onager with a wild ass, and that of Umbricius with a shady tree.\r\nLeo’s grave received a lion; Doleus, father and son, two casks;\r\nHerbacia, two baskets of herbs; and Porcula, a pig. It requires,\r\ntherefore, but the least possible imagination to see that all these\r\nsymbols and advertisements were by no means confined to the use of the\r\ndead, but were extensively used in the interests of the living.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _WALL INSCRIPTIONS IN POMPEII.--Signor Raphael Garrucci,\r\nto whom we are indebted for these Plates, in commenting upon Group 5\r\n(LX., IIII., IIII., VII., ZV., Ε., ΓΑ., III., S., CIA.), says, “I will\r\nnow give my opinion upon this strange combination of Greek and Roman\r\nsigns--it seems to me a custom introduced even at Rome since the epoch\r\nof Augustus, to mingle the Greek numeral elements with Latin signs.”_]\r\n\r\nStreet advertising, in its most original form among us, was therefore\r\nwithout doubt derived from the Romans; and this system gradually grew,\r\nuntil, in the Middle Ages, there was hardly a house of business without\r\nits distinctive sign or advertisement; which was the more necessary, as\r\nin those days numbers to houses were unknown. “In the Middle Ages the\r\nhouses of the nobility, both in town and country, when the family was\r\nabsent, were used as hostelries for travellers. The family arms always\r\nhung in front of the house, and the most conspicuous object in those\r\narms gave a name to the establishment amongst travellers, who,\r\nunacquainted with the mysteries of heraldry, called a lion gules or\r\nazure by the vernacular name of the Red or Blue Lion. Such coats of arms\r\ngradually became a very popular intimation that there was--\r\n\r\n    Good entertainment for all that passes--\r\n    Horses, mares, men, and asses.\r\n\r\nAnd innkeepers began to adopt them, hanging out red lions and green\r\ndragons as the best way to acquaint the public that they offered food\r\nand shelter. Still, as long as civilisation was only at a low ebb, the\r\nso-called open houses few, and competition trifling, signs were of but\r\nlittle use. A few objects, typical of the trade carried on, would\r\nsuffice; a knife for the cutler, a stocking for the hosier, a hand for\r\nthe glover, a pair of scissors for the tailor, a bunch of grapes for the\r\nvintner, fully answered public requirements. But as luxury increased,\r\nand the number of houses or shops dealing in the same article\r\nmultiplied, something more was wanted. Particular trades continued to be\r\nconfined to particular streets; the desideratum then was to give to each\r\nshop a name or token by which it might be mentioned in conversation, so\r\nthat it could be recommended and customers sent to it. Reading was still\r\na scarce acquirement, consequently to write up the owner’s name would\r\nhave been of little use. Those that could advertised their name by a\r\nrebus--thus, a hare and a bottle stood for Harebottle, and two cocks for\r\nCox. Others, whose names could represent, adopted pictorial objects; and\r\nas the quantity of these augmented, new subjects were continually\r\nrequired. The animal kingdom was ransacked, from the mighty elephant to\r\nthe humble bee, from the eagle to the sparrow; the vegetable kingdom,\r\nfrom the palm-tree and cedar to the marigold and daisy; everything on\r\nthe earth and in the firmament above it was put under contribution.\r\nPortraits of the great men of all ages, and views of towns, both painted\r\nwith a great deal more of fancy than of truth; articles of dress,\r\nimplements of trades, domestic utensils, things visible and invisible,\r\n‘Ea quæ sunt tanquam ea quæ non sunt,’ everything was attempted in order\r\nto attract attention and to obtain publicity. Finally, as all signs in a\r\ntown were painted by the same small number of individuals, whose talents\r\nand imagination were limited, it followed that the same subjects were\r\noften repeated, introducing only a change in the colour for a\r\ndifference.”[6]\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing can be traced the gradual growth of street\r\nadvertising until it has reached its present extensive pitch; and though\r\nthe process may be characterised as slow, no one who looks around at the\r\nwell-covered hoardings and the be-plastered signs on detached and\r\nprominent houses can doubt that it is sure. Proclamations, and suchlike\r\nofficial announcements, were probably the first specimens of street\r\nadvertising, as we now understand the term; but it was not until\r\nprinting became general, and until the people became conversant with the\r\nmysteries of reading and writing, that posters and handbills were to any\r\nextent used. Mention is made in 1679 of a tradesman named Jonathan\r\nHolder, haberdasher, of the city of London, who gave to every purchaser\r\nto the extent of a guinea a printed list of the articles kept in stock\r\nby him, with the prices affixed. The paper in which this item of news\r\nwas recorded seems to have regarded Mr Holder’s practice as a dangerous\r\ninnovation, and remarks that it would be quite destructive to trade if\r\nshopkeepers lavished so much of their capital in printing useless bills.\r\nThis utterance now seems ridiculous; but in the course of another two\r\ncenturies many orthodox opinions of the present day will receive as\r\ncomplete a downfall as that just recorded.\r\n\r\nWithin the recollections of men who are still young street advertising\r\nhas considerably changed. Twenty years ago the billsticker was a\r\nnuisance of the most intolerable kind, and though we can hardly now\r\nconsider him a blessing, his habits have changed very much for the\r\nbetter. Never heeding the constant announcement to him to beware, the\r\nbillsticker cared nothing for the privacy of dead walls, or, for the\r\nmatter of that, of dwelling-houses and street doors; and though he was\r\nhardly ever himself to be seen, his disfigurative work was a prominent\r\nfeature of the metropolis. It was also considered by him a point of\r\nhonour--if the term may be used in connection with billstickers--to\r\npaste over the work of a rival; and so the hoardings used to present the\r\nmost heterogeneous possible appearance, and though bills were plentiful,\r\ntheir intelligibility was of a very limited description. Sunday morning\r\nearly used to be a busy time with the wandering billsticker. Provided\r\nwith a light cart and an assistant, he would make a raid on a whole\r\ndistrict, sticking his notices and disappearing with marvellous\r\nrapidity. And how he would chuckle as he drove away, more especially if,\r\nin addition to disfiguring a private wall, he had succeeded in covering\r\nover the handiwork of a rival! For this reason the artful billsticker\r\nused to select a time when it was still early enough to evade detection,\r\nand yet late enough to deface the work of those who had gone before him.\r\nBillsticking was thus an art attended with some difficulties; and it was\r\nnot until the advent of contractors, like Willing, Partington, and\r\nothers, that any positive publicity could be depended upon in connection\r\nwith posting.\r\n\r\nYet, in the days of which we have just been speaking, the man of paste\r\nconsidered himself a very important personage; and it is not so very\r\nlong since one individual published himself under the style and title of\r\n“Champion Billposter,” and as such defied all comers. It was for some\r\ntime doubtful whether his claims depended upon his ability to beat and\r\nthrash all rivals at fisticuffs, whether he was able to stick more bills\r\nin a given time than any other man, or whether he had a larger and more\r\nimportant connection than usually fell to the poster’s lot; in fact, the\r\nquestion has never been settled, for exception having been taken to his\r\nassumption of the title of champion from any point of view, and\r\nreference having been made to the editors of sporting papers, the\r\nambitious one gracefully withdrew his pretensions, and the matter\r\nsubsided. A generation ago one of the most popular songs of the day\r\ncommenced something like this--\r\n\r\n    “I’m Sammy Slap the billsticker, and you must all agree, sirs,\r\n    I sticks to business like a trump while business sticks to me, sirs.\r\n    There’s some folks calls me plasterer, but they deserve a banging,\r\n    Cause yer see, genteelly speaking, that my trade is paperhanging.\r\n                      With my paste, paste, paste!\r\n                      All the world is puffing,\r\n                      So I’ll paste, paste, paste!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD BILL-STATION.]\r\n\r\nThe advent of advertisement contractors, who purchased the right,\r\nexclusive and absolute, to stick bills on a hoarding, considerably\r\nnarrowed the avocations of what might almost have been called the\r\npredatory billsticker. For a long time the fight was fierce and often;\r\nas soon as an “advertisement station” had been finished off, its bills\r\nand announcements being all regulated with mathematical precision, a\r\ncloud of skirmishers, armed to the teeth with bills, pots, and brushes,\r\nwould convert, in a few minutes, the orderly arrangements of the\r\ncontractor to a perfect chaos. But time, which rights all things, aided\r\nin the present instance by a few magisterial decisions, and by an\r\nunlooked-for and unaccountable alacrity on the part of the police, set\r\nthese matters straight; and now it is hard to find an enclosure in\r\nLondon the hoarding of which is not notified as being the “advertisement\r\nstation” of some contractor or other who would blush to be called\r\nbillsticker. In the suburbs the flying brigade is still to be found hard\r\nat work, but daily its campaigning ground becomes more limited, and\r\ngradually these Bashi-Bazouks of billsticking are becoming absorbed into\r\nthe regular ranks of the agents’ standing corps.\r\n\r\nPlacard advertising, of an orderly, and even ornamental, character, has\r\nassumed extensive proportions at most of the metropolitan railway\r\nstations, the agents to whom we have just referred having extended their\r\noperations in the direction of blank spaces on the walls, which they\r\nsublet to the general advertising public. Often firms which advertise on\r\nan extensive scale themselves contract with the railway companies, and\r\nnot a few have extended their announcements from the stations to the\r\nsides of the line, little enamelled plates being used for this purpose.\r\nAny one having a vacant space at the side of his house, or a blank wall\r\nto the same, may, provided he live in anything like a business\r\nthoroughfare, and that the vantage place is free from obstruction, do\r\nadvantageous business with an advertisement contractor; and, as matters\r\nare progressing, we may some day expect to see not only the private\r\nwalls of the houses in Belgrave Square and suchlike fashionable\r\nlocalities well papered, but the outsides and insides of our public\r\nbuildings utilised as well by the hand of the advertiser. One thing is\r\ncertain, no one could say that many of the latter would be spoiled, no\r\nmatter what the innovation to which they were subjected.\r\n\r\nThe most recent novelty in advertising has been the introduction of a\r\ncabinet, surmounted by a clock face, into public-house bars and luncheon\r\nrooms. These cabinets are divided into spaces of say a superficial foot\r\neach, which are to be let off at a set price. So far as we have yet\r\nseen, these squares have been filled for the most part with the\r\npromoters’ advertisements only; and it is admitted by all who know most\r\nabout advertising that the very worst sign one can have as to the\r\nsuccess of a medium is that of an advertisement emanating from the\r\npromoters or proprietors of anything in which such advertisement\r\nappears. Why this should be we are not prepared to say. We are more able\r\nto show why it should not be; for no man, advertisement contractor or\r\notherwise, should, under fair commercial conditions, ask another to do\r\nwhat he would not do himself. So we are satisfied to rest content with\r\nthe knowledge that what we have stated is fact, however incongruous it\r\nmay seem, which any one can endorse by applying himself to the ethics of\r\nadvertising. Certainly, in the instance quoted, the matter looks very\r\nsuggestive; perhaps it depends on the paradox, that he who is most\r\nanxious that others should advertise is least inclined to do so himself.\r\n\r\nNot long ago the promoters of a patent umbrella, which seems to have\r\ngone the mysterious way of all umbrellas, patent or otherwise, and to\r\nhave disappeared, availed themselves of a great boat-race to attract\r\npublic attention to their wares. Skiffs fitted with sails, on each of\r\nwhich were painted the patent parapluie, and a recommendation to buy\r\nit, dotted the river, and continually evaded the efforts of the\r\nConservancy Police, who were endeavouring to marshal all the small craft\r\ntogether, so as to leave a clear course for the competitors. Every time\r\none of these advertising boats broke out into mid-stream, carrying its\r\neternal umbrella between the dense lines of spectators, the\r\nadvertisement was extremely valuable, for straying boats of any kind are\r\non such occasions very noticeable, and these were of course much more\r\nso. Still it would seem from the sequel that this bold innovation had\r\nbeen better applied to something more likely to hit the public taste;\r\nfor whether it was that people, knowing how fleeting a joy is a good\r\numbrella, were determined not to put temptation in the way of their\r\nfriends, or whether the experiment absorbed all the spare capital of the\r\ninventor and patentees, we know not; but this we do know, that since the\r\ntime of which we speak little or nothing has been heard of the novel\r\n“gingham.”\r\n\r\nAnother innovation in the way of advertisements was that, common a few\r\nyears back, of stencilling the flagstones. At first this system assumed\r\nvery small proportions, a parallelogram, looking like an envelope with a\r\nblack border that had been dropped, and containing the address of the\r\nadvertiser, being the object of the artist entrusted with the mission.\r\nGradually, however, the inscriptions grew, until they became a perfect\r\nnuisance, and were put down--if the term applies to anything on such a\r\nlow level--by the intervention of the police and the magistrates. The\r\nundertakers were the greatest sinners in this respect, the invitations\r\nto be buried being most numerous and varied. These “black workers” or\r\n“death-hunters,” as they are often called, are in London most persistent\r\nadvertisers. They can hardly think that people will die to oblige them\r\nand do good for trade, yet in some districts they will, with the most\r\nundeviating persistency, drop their little books, informing you how,\r\nwhen, where, and at what rates you may be buried with economy or\r\ndespatch, or both, as the case may be, down your area, or poke them\r\nunder your door, or into the letter-box. More, it is stated on good\r\nauthority, than one pushing contractor, living in a poor neighbourhood,\r\nobtains a list of all the folk attended by the parish doctor, and at\r\neach of the houses leaves his little pamphlet, let us hope with the\r\ndesire of cheering and comforting the sick and ailing. To such a man\r\nDeath must come indeed as a friend, so long, of course, as the grim king\r\ncomes to the customers only.\r\n\r\nA few years back, when hoardings were common property, the undertakers\r\nhad a knack of posting their dismal little price-lists in the centre of\r\ngreat broadsheets likely to attract any unusual share of attention. They\r\nwere not particular, however, and any vantage space, from a doorpost to\r\na dead wall, came within their comprehension. Another ingenious, and,\r\nfrom its colour, somewhat suggestive, plan was about this time brought\r\ninto requisition by an undertaker for the destruction of a successful\r\nrival’s advertisements. He armed one of his assistants with a great can\r\nof blacking and a brush, and instructed him to go by secret ways and\r\ndeface the opposition placards. Of course the other man followed suit,\r\nand for a time an undertaker’s bill was known best by its illegibility.\r\nBut ultimately these two men of colour met and fought with the\r\ninstruments provided by their employers. They did not look lovely when\r\ncharged before a magistrate next morning, and being bound over to keep\r\nthe peace, departed to worry each other, or each other’s bills, no more.\r\nThere is another small bill feature of advertising London which is so\r\nobjectionable that we will pass it by with a simple thankful notice that\r\nits promoters are sometimes overtaken by tardy but ironhanded justice.\r\n\r\nMost people can recollect the hideous glass pillars or “indicators”\r\nwhich, for advertising purposes, were stuck about London. The first one\r\nmade its appearance at Hyde Park Corner, and though, in deference to\r\npublic opinion, it did not remain there very long, less aristocratic\r\nneighbourhoods had to bear their adornments until the complete failure\r\nof the attempt to obtain advertisements to fill the vacant spaces showed\r\nhow fatuous was the project. The last of these posts, we remember, was\r\nopposite the Angel at Islington, and there, assisted by local faith and\r\nindolence, it remained until a short time back. But it too has gone now,\r\nand with it has almost faded the recollection of these hideous\r\nnightmares of advertising.\r\n\r\nThe huge vans, plastered all over with bills, which used to traverse\r\nLondon, to the terror of the horses and wonder of the yokels, were\r\nimproved off the face of the earth a quarter of a century ago; and now\r\nthe only perambulating advertisement we have is the melancholy\r\nsandwich-man and the dispenser of handbills, gentlemen who sometimes\r\n“double their parts,” to use a theatrical expression. To a playhouse\r\nmanager we owe the biggest thing in street and general advertising--that\r\nin connection with the “Dead Heart”--that has yet been recorded. Mr\r\nSmith, who had charge of this department of the Adelphi, has published a\r\nstatement which gives the totals as follows:--10,000,000 adhesive labels\r\n(which, by the way, were an intolerable nuisance), 30,000 small cuts of\r\nthe guillotine scene, 5000 reams of note-paper, 110,000 business\r\nenvelopes, 60,000 stamped envelopes, 2000 six-sheet cuts of Bastile\r\nscene, 5,000,000 handbills, 1000 six-sheet posters, 500 slips, 1,000,000\r\ncards heartshaped, 100 twenty-eight sheet posters, and 20,000 folio\r\ncards for shop windows. This was quite exclusive of newspaper wrappers\r\nand various other ingenious means of attracting attention to the play\r\nthroughout the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nAmong other forms of advertising, that on the copper coinage must not be\r\nforgotten. The extensive defacement of the pence and halfpence of the\r\nrealm in the interests of a well-known weekly paper ultimately led to\r\nthe interference of Parliament, and may fairly be regarded as the cause,\r\nor at all events as one of the principal causes, of the sum of £10,000\r\nbeing voted in July 1855 for the replacement of the old, worn, battered,\r\nand mixed coppers by our present bronze coinage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now, having given a hurried and summarised glance at the growth and\r\nprogress of advertising of all kinds and descriptions, from the earliest\r\nperiods till the present time, we will begin at the beginning, and tell\r\nthe story with all its ramifications, mainly according to those best\r\npossible authorities, the advertisements themselves.\r\n\r\n  [4] The opening notice of the baths at Pompeii was almost perfect when\r\n  discovered, and originally read thus:--“Dedicatone . Thermarum .\r\n  Muneris . Cnæi . Allei . Nigidii . Maii . Venalio . Athelæ .\r\n  Sparsiones . Vela . Erunt . Maio . Principi . Coloniæ . Feliciter.”\r\n\r\n  [5] _Notes and Queries_, vol. xi., 3d series.\r\n\r\n  [6] “History of Signboards.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_ANCIENT FORMS OF ADVERTISING._\r\n\r\n\r\nThough it would be quite impossible to give any exact idea as to the\r\nperiod when the identical first advertisement of any kind made its\r\nappearance, or what particular clime has the honour of introducing a\r\nsystem which now plays so important a part in all civilised countries,\r\nthere need be no hesitation in ascribing the origin of advertising to\r\nthe remotest possible times--to the earliest times when competition,\r\ncaused by an increasing population, led each man to make efforts in that\r\nrace for prominence which has in one way or other gone on ever since. As\r\nsoon as the progress of events or the development of civilisation had\r\ncast communities together, each individual member naturally tried to do\r\nthe best he could for himself, and as he, in the course of events, had\r\nnaturally to encounter rivals in his way of life, it is not hard to\r\nunderstand that some means of preventing a particular light being hid\r\nunder a bushel soon presented itself. That this means was an\r\nadvertisement is almost certain; and so almost as long as there has been\r\na world--or quite as long, using the term as it is best understood\r\nnow--there have been advertisements. At this early stage of history,\r\nalmost every trade and profession was still exercised by itinerants, who\r\nproclaimed their wares or their qualifications with more or less flowery\r\nencomiums, with, in fact, the advertisement verbal, which, under some\r\ncircumstances, is still very useful. But the time came when the\r\ntradesman or professor settled down, and opened what, for argument’s\r\nsake, we will call a shop. Then another method of obtaining publicity\r\nbecame requisite, and the crier stepped forward to act as a medium\r\nbetween the provider and the consumer. This is, however, but another\r\nform of the same system, and, like its simpler congener, has still an\r\nexistence, though not an ostentatious one. When the art of writing was\r\ninvented, the means of extending the knowledge which had heretofore been\r\nsimply cried, was greatly extended, and advertising gradually became an\r\nart to be cultivated.\r\n\r\nVery soon after the invention of writing in its rudest form, it was\r\nturned to account in the way of giving publicity to events in the way of\r\nadvertisement; for rewards for and descriptions of runaway slaves,\r\nwritten on papyri more than three thousand years ago, have been exhumed\r\nfrom the ruins of Thebes. An early but mythical instance of a reward\r\nbeing offered in an advertisement is related by Pausanias,[7] who,\r\nspeaking of the art of working metals, says that the people of Phineum,\r\nin Arcadia, pretended that Ulysses dedicated a statue of bronze to\r\nNeptune, in the hope that by that deity’s intervention he might recover\r\nthe horses he had lost; and, he adds, “they showed me an inscription on\r\nthe pedestal of the statue offering a reward to any person who should\r\nfind and take care of the animals.”\r\n\r\nThe Greeks used another mode of giving publicity which is worthy of\r\nremark here. They used to affix to the statues of the infernal deities,\r\nin the _temenos_ of their temples, curses inscribed on sheets of lead,\r\nby which they devoted to the vengeance of those gods the persons who had\r\nfound or stolen certain things, or injured the advertisers in any other\r\nway. As the names of the offenders were given in full in these singular\r\ninscriptions, they had the effect of making the grievances known to\r\nmortals as well as immortals, and thus the advertisement was attained.\r\nThe only difference between these and ordinary public notices was that\r\nthe threat of punishment was held out instead of the offer of reward. A\r\ncompromise was endeavoured generally at the same time, the evil invoked\r\nbeing deprecated in case of restitution of the property. A most\r\ninteresting collection of such imprecations (_diræ defixiones_, or\r\nκατάδεσμοι) was found in 1858 in the _temenos_ of the infernal deities\r\nattached to the temple of Demeter at Cnidus. It is at present deposited\r\nin the British Museum, where the curious reader may inspect it in the\r\nsecond vase-room.\r\n\r\nA common mode of advertising, about the same time, was by means of the\r\npublic crier, κήρυξ. In comparatively modern times our town-criers have\r\nbeen proverbial for murdering the king’s English, or, at all events, of\r\nrobbing it of all elecutionary beauties. Not so among the Greeks, who\r\nwere so nice in point of oratorical power, and so offended by a vicious\r\npronunciation, that they would not suffer even the public crier to\r\nproclaim their laws unless he was accompanied by a musician, who, in\r\ncase of an inexact tone, might be ready to give him the proper pitch and\r\nexpression. But this would hardly be the case when the public crier was\r\nemployed by private individuals. In Apuleius (“Golden Ass”) we are\r\nbrought face to face with one of these characters, a cunning rogue, full\r\nof low humour, who appears to have combined the duties of crier and\r\nauctioneer. Thus, when the slave and the ass are led out for sale, the\r\ncrier proclaims the price of each with a loud voice, joking at the same\r\ntime to the best of his abilities, in order to keep the audience in good\r\nhumour. This latter idea has not been lost sight of in more modern days.\r\n“The crier, bawling till his throat was almost split, cracked all sorts\r\nof ridiculous jokes upon me [the ass]. ‘What is the use,’ said he, ‘of\r\noffering for sale this old screw of a jackass, with his foundered hoofs,\r\nhis ugly colour, his sluggishness in everything but vice, and a hide\r\nthat is nothing but a ready-made sieve? Let us even make a present of\r\nhim, if we can find any one who will not be loth to throw away hay on\r\nthe brute.’ In this way the crier kept the bystanders in roars of\r\nlaughter.”[8]\r\n\r\nThe same story furnishes further particulars regarding the ancient mode\r\nof crying. When Psyche has absconded, Venus requests Mercury “to\r\nproclaim her in public, and announce a reward to him who shall find\r\nher.” She further enjoins the divine crier to “clearly describe the\r\nmarks by which Psyche may be recognised, that no one may excuse himself\r\non the plea of ignorance, if he incurs the crime of unlawfully\r\nconcealing her.” So saying, she gives him a little book, in which is\r\nwritten Psyche’s name and sundry particulars. Mercury thereupon descends\r\nto the earth, and goes about among all nations, where he thus proclaims\r\nthe loss of Psyche, and the reward for her return:--“If any one can\r\nseize her in her flight, and bring back a fugitive daughter of a king, a\r\nhandmaid of Venus, by name Psyche, or discover where she has concealed\r\nherself, let such person repair to Mercury, the crier, behind the\r\nboundaries of Murtia,[9] and receive by way of reward for the discovery\r\nseven sweet kisses from Venus herself, and one exquisitely delicious\r\ntouch of her charming tongue.” A somewhat similar reward is offered by\r\nVenus in the hue and cry she raises after her fugitive son in the first\r\nidyl of Moschus, a Syracusan poet who flourished about 250 years before\r\nthe Christian era: “If any one has seen my son Eros straying in the\r\ncross roads, [know ye] he is a runaway. The informer shall have a\r\nreward. The kiss of Venus shall be your pay; and if you bring him, not\r\nthe bare kiss only, but, stranger, you shall have something more.”[10]\r\nThis something more is probably the “quidquid post oscula dulce” of\r\nSecundus, but is sufficiently vague to be anything else, and certainly\r\npromises much more than the “will be rewarded” of our own time.\r\n\r\nSo far with the Greeks and their advertisements. Details grow more\r\nabundant when we enter upon the subject of advertising in Rome. The\r\ncities of Herculaneum and Pompeii, buried in the midst of their sorrows\r\nand pleasures, their joys and cares, in the very midst of the turmoil of\r\nlife and commerce, and discovered ages after exactly as they were on the\r\nmorning of that ominous 24th of August A.D. 79, show us that the benefit\r\nto be derived from publicity was well understood in those luxurious and\r\nhighly-cultivated cities. The walls in the most frequented parts are\r\ncovered with notices of a different kind, painted in black or red. Their\r\nspelling is very indifferent, and the painters who busied themselves\r\nwith this branch of the profession do not appear to have aimed at\r\nanything like artistic uniformity or high finish. Still these\r\nadvertisements, hasty and transitory as they are, bear voluminous\r\ntestimony as to the state of society, the wants and requirements, and\r\nthe actual standard of public taste of the Romans in that age. As might\r\nbe expected, advertisements of plays and gladiators are common. Of these\r\nthe public were acquainted in the following forms,--\r\n\r\n  AEDILIS . FAMILIA . GLADIATORIA . PUGNABIT\r\n  POMPEIS . PR . K . JUNIAS . VENATIO ET VELA\r\n  ERUNT.\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n  N . FESTI AMPLIATI\r\n  FAMILIA GLADIATORIA . PUGNA ITERUM\r\n  PUGNA . XVI . K . JVN . VENAT . VELA.[11]\r\n\r\nSuch inscriptions occur in various parts of Pompeii, sometimes written\r\non smooth surfaces between pilasters (denominated _albua_), at other\r\ntimes painted on the walls. Places of great resort were selected for\r\npreference, and thus it is that numerous advertisements are found under\r\nthe portico of the baths at Pompeii, where persons waited for admission,\r\nand where notices of shows, exhibitions, or sales would be sure to\r\nattract the attention of the weary lounger.\r\n\r\nBaths we find advertised in the following terms,--\r\n\r\n  THERMAE\r\n  M . CRASSI FRUGII\r\n  AQUA . MARINA . ET . BALN.\r\n  AQUA . DULCI . JANUARIUS . L.\r\n\r\nwhich of course means “warm, sea, and fresh water baths.” As provincials\r\nadd to their notices “as in London,” or “à la mode de Paris,” so\r\nPompeians and others not unfrequently proclaimed that they followed the\r\ncustoms of Rome at their several establishments. Thus the keeper of a\r\nbathing-house near Bologna acquainted the public that--\r\n\r\n  IN . PRAEDIS\r\n  C . LEGIANNI VERI\r\n  BALNEUM . MORE . URBICO . LAVAT.\r\n  OMNIA COMMODA . PRAESTANTUR.\r\n\r\nAt his establishments there were baths according to the fashion of “the\r\ntown,” besides “every convenience.” And a similar inscription occurred\r\nby the Via Nomentana, eight miles from Rome--\r\n\r\n  IN . PRAEDIS . AURE\r\n  LIAE . FAUSTINIANAE\r\n  BALINEUS . LAVAT . MO\r\n  RE . URBICO . ET OMNIS.\r\n  HUMANITAS . PRAESTA\r\n  TUR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _WALL INSCRIPTIONS IN POMPEII.--Antigonus, the hero of\r\n2112 victories. Superbus, a comparatively unknown man. Casuntius, the\r\nmaster of the latter, is supposed to be in the act of advising him to\r\nyield to the invincible retiarius. The other figure represents Aniketos\r\nAchilles, a great Samnite gladiator, who merited the title of\r\ninvincible._]\r\n\r\nThose who had premises to let or sell affixed a short notice to the\r\nhouse itself, and more detailed bills were posted at the “advertising\r\nstations.” Thus in Plautus’s “Trinummus,” Act v., the indignant\r\nCallicles says to his spendthrift son, “You have dared to put up in my\r\nabsence, and unknown to me, that this house is to be sold”--(“Ædes\r\nvenales hasce inscribit literis”). Sometimes, also, the inscription,\r\n“Illico ædes venales” (“here is a house for sale”) appears to have been\r\npainted on the door, or on the _album_. An auctioneer would describe a\r\nhouse as “Villa bona beneque edificata” (a good and well-built house),\r\nand full details of the premises were given in the larger placards\r\npainted on walls. In the street of the Fullers in Pompeii occurs the\r\nfollowing inscription, painted in red, over another which had been\r\npainted in black and whitewashed over,--\r\n\r\n  IN . PRAEDIS . JULIAE . S . P . F . FELICIS\r\n  LOCANTUR\r\n  BALNEUM . VENEREUM . ET . NONGENTUM . PERGULAE\r\n  CENACULA . EX . IDIBUS . AUG . PRIORIS . IN . IDUS . AUG .\r\n  SEXTAS . ANNOS . CONTINUOS . QUINQUE.\r\n  S . Q . D . L . E . N . C.\r\n\r\nWhich has been translated, “On the estate of Julia Felix, daughter of\r\nSpurius Felix, are to let from the 1st to the 6th of the ides of August\r\n(_i.e._, between August 6th and 8th), on a lease of five years, a bath,\r\na venereum, and nine hundred shops, bowers, and upper apartments.”[12]\r\nThe seven final initials, antiquaries, who profess to read what to\r\nothers is unreadable, explain, “They are not to let to any person\r\nexercising an infamous profession.” But as this seems a singular clause\r\nwhere there is a _venereum_ to be let, other erudites have seen in it,\r\n“Si quis dominam loci eius non cognoverit,” and fancy that they read\r\nunderneath, “Adeat Suettum Verum,” in which case the whole should mean,\r\n“If anybody should not know the lady of the house, let him go to Suettus\r\nVerus.” The following is another example of the way in which Roman\r\nlandlords advertised “desirable residences,” and “commodious business\r\npremises”--\r\n\r\n  INSULA ARRIANA\r\n  POLLIANA .

Alifius Nigidius, senior, are to let from the first of the ides of\r\nJuly, shops with their bowers, and gentlemen’s apartments. The hirer\r\nmust apply to the slave of Cn. Alifius Nigidius, senior.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _WALL INSCRIPTIONS IN POMPEII.--Apparently remarks and\r\nopinions expressed by inhabitants, with reference to their fancies and\r\nfavourites, in the circuses and at other public exhibitions._]\r\n\r\nBoth the Greeks and the Romans had on their houses a piece of the wall\r\nwhitened to receive inscriptions relative to their affairs. The first\r\ncalled this λεύκωμα, the latter _album_. Many examples of them are found\r\nin Pompeii, generally in very inferior writing and spelling. Even the\r\nschoolmaster Valentinus, who on his album, as was the constant practice,\r\ninvoked the patronage of some high personages, was very loose in his\r\ngrammar, and the untoward outbreak of Vesuvius has perpetuated his\r\nblundering use of an accusative instead of an ablative: “Cum discentes\r\nsuos.” All the Pompeian inscriptions mentioned above were painted, but a\r\nfew instances also occur of notices being merely scratched on the wall.\r\nThus we find in one place, “Damas audi,” and on a pier at the angle of\r\nthe house of the tragic poet is an Etruscan inscription scratched in the\r\nwall with a nail, which has been translated by a learned Neapolitan,\r\n“You shall hear a poem of Numerius.” But these so-called Etruscan\r\ninscriptions are by no means so well understood as we could wish, and\r\ntheir interpretation is far from incontestable. There is another on a\r\nhouse of Pompeii, which has been Latinised into, “Ex hinc viatoriens\r\nante turri xii inibi. Sarinus Publii cauponatur. Ut adires. Vale.” That\r\nis, “Traveller, going from here to the twelfth tower, there Sarinus\r\nkeeps a tavern. This is to request you to enter. Farewell.” This\r\ninscription, however, is so obscure that another _savant_ has read in it\r\na notification that a certain magistrate, Adirens Caius, had brought the\r\nwaters of the Sarno to Pompeii--a most material difference certainly.\r\n\r\nWe are made acquainted with other Roman bills and advertisements by the\r\nworks of the poets and dramatists. Thus at Trimalchion’s banquet, in the\r\n“Satyricon,” Pliny mentions that a poet hired a house, built an oratory,\r\nhired forms, and dispersed prospectuses. They also read their works\r\npublicly,[13] an occupation in which they were much interrupted and\r\nannoyed by idlers and impertinent boys. Another mode of advertising new\r\nworks more resembled that of our own country. The Roman booksellers used\r\nto placard their shops with the titles of the new books they had for\r\nsale. Such was the shop of Atrectus, described by Martial--\r\n\r\n    Contra Cæsaris est forum taberna\r\n    Scriptis postibus hinc et inde totis\r\n    Omnes ut cito perlegas poetas\r\n    Illinc me pete.\r\n\r\n  [7] Pausanias Græc., lib. viii. c. 14, Arcadia.\r\n\r\n  [8] Apuleius, Golden Ass, Book viii., Episode 8.\r\n\r\n  [9] The spot here mentioned was at the back of the Temple of Venus\r\n  Myrtia (the myrtle Venus), on Mount Aventine in Rome.\r\n\r\n  [10] Apuleius, Book vi.\r\n\r\n  [11] That is, “The troop of gladiators of the ædil will fight on the\r\n  31st of May. There will be fights with wild animals, and an awning to\r\n  keep off the sun.” Wind and weather permitting, there were awnings\r\n  over the heads of the spectators; but, generally, there appears to\r\n  have been too much wind in this breezy summer retreat to admit of this\r\n  luxury. “Nam ventus populo vela negare solet,” says Martial, and the\r\n  same idea occurs in three other places in this poet’s works (vi. 9;\r\n  xi. 21; xiv. 29). Sometimes, also, the bills of gladiators promise\r\n  _sparsiones_, which consisted in certain sprinklings of water perfumed\r\n  with saffron or other odours; and, as they produced what was called a\r\n  nimbus, or cloud, the perfumes were probably dispersed over the\r\n  audience in drops by means of pipes or spouts, or, perhaps, by some\r\n  kind of rude engine.\r\n\r\n  [12] Nine hundred shops in a town which would hardly contain more than\r\n  about twelve hundred is rather incredible--perhaps it should be\r\n  ninety. _Pergulæ_ were either porticos shaded with verdure, lattices\r\n  with creeping plants, or small rooms above the shops, bedrooms for the\r\n  shopkeepers. _Cœnacula_ were rooms under the terraces. When they were\r\n  good enough to let to the higher classes they were called _equestria_\r\n  (as in the following advertisement). Plutarch informs us that Sylla,\r\n  in his younger days, lived in one of them, where he paid a rent of £8\r\n  a year.\r\n\r\n  [13] A. L. Millin, Description d’un Mosaique antique du Musée Pio.\r\n  Clementin, à Rome, 1819, p. 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_MEDIÆVAL AND OTHER VARIETIES OF ADVERTISING._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ages which immediately succeeded the fall of the Roman Empire,\r\nand the western migration of the barbarian hordes, darkness and\r\nignorance held paramount sway, education was at a terrible discount, and\r\nthe arts of reading and writing were confined almost entirely to the\r\nmonks and the superior clergy. In fact, it was regarded as evidence of\r\neffeminacy for any knight or noble to be able to make marks on parchment\r\nor vellum, or to be able to decipher them when made. Newspapers were, of\r\ncourse, things undreamt of, but newsmen--itinerants who collected scraps\r\nof information and retailed them in the towns and market-places--were\r\nnow and again to be found. The travelling packman or pedlar was,\r\nhowever, the chief medium of intercommunication in the Middle Ages, and\r\nit is not hard to imagine how welcome his appearance must have been in\r\nthose days, when a hundred miles constituted an immense and almost\r\ninterminable journey. We know how bad the roads were, and how difficult\r\ntravelling was in comparatively modern days, but we can form very little\r\nidea of the obstacles which beset all attempts at the communication of\r\none commercial centre with another in the early Middle Ages. Everybody\r\nbeing alike shrouded in the darkness of ignorance, it is safe to assume,\r\ntherefore, that written advertisements were quite unknown, as few beyond\r\nthose who had written them would have been able to understand them.\r\nNearly the whole of the laity, from the king to the villain or thrall,\r\nwere equally illiterate, and once more the public crier became the only\r\nmedium for obtaining publicity; but from the simple mode in which all\r\nbusiness was conducted his position was probably a sinecure. An\r\noccasional proclamation of peace or war, or a sale of slaves or plunder,\r\nwas probably the only topic which gave him the opportunity of exercising\r\nhis eloquence. But with the increase of civilisation, and consequent\r\nwealth and competition, the crier’s labours assumed a wider field.\r\n\r\nThe mediæval crier used to carry a horn, by means of which he attracted\r\nthe people’s attention when about to make a proclamation or publication.\r\nPublic criers appear to have formed a well-organised body in France as\r\nearly as the twelfth century; for by a charter of Louis VII., granted in\r\nthe year 1141 to the inhabitants of the province of Berry, the old\r\ncustom of the country was confirmed, according to which there were to be\r\nonly twelve criers, five of which should go about the taverns crying\r\nwith their usual cry, and carrying with them samples of the wine they\r\ncried, in order that the people might taste. For the first time they\r\nblew the horn they were entitled to a penny, and the same for every time\r\nafter, according to custom. These criers of wine were a French\r\npeculiarity, of which we find no parallel in the history of England.\r\nThey perambulated the streets of Paris in troops, each with a large\r\nwooden measure of wine in his hand, from which to make the passers-by\r\ntaste the wine they proclaimed, a mode of advertising which would be\r\nvery agreeable in the present day, but which would, we fancy, be rather\r\ntoo successful for the advertiser. These wine-criers are mentioned by\r\nJohn de Garlando, a Norman writer, who was probably a contemporary of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror. “Præcones vini,” says he, “clamant hiante gula,\r\nvinum venumdandum in tabernis ad quatuor denarios.”[14] A quaint and\r\nsignificant story is told in an old chronicle in connection with this\r\nsystem of advertising. An old woman, named Adelheid, was possessed of a\r\nstrong desire to proclaim the Word of God, but not having lungs\r\nsufficiently powerful for the noisy propagation contemplated by her, she\r\npaid a wine-crier to go about the town, and, instead of proclaiming the\r\nprices of the wine, to proclaim these sacred words: “God is righteous!\r\nGod is merciful! God is good and excellent!” And as the man went about\r\nshouting these words she followed him, exclaiming, “He speaks well! he\r\nsays truly!” The poor old body hardly succeeded according to her pious\r\ndesire, for she was arrested and tried, and as it was thought she had\r\ndone this out of vanity (_causa laudis humanæ_), she was burned\r\nalive.[15] From this it would seem that there was as much protection for\r\nthe monks in their profession as for the criers, who were very proud of\r\ntheir special prerogatives.\r\n\r\nThe public criers in France, at an early period, were formed into a\r\ncorporation, and in 1258 obtained various statutes from Philip Augustus,\r\nsome of which, relating to the criers of wine, are excessively curious.\r\nThus it was ordained that--\r\n\r\n“Whosoever is a crier in Paris may go to any tavern he likes and cry its\r\nwine, provided they sell wine from the wood, and that there is no other\r\ncrier employed for that tavern; and the tavern-keeper cannot prohibit\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“If a crier finds people drinking in a tavern, he may ask what they pay\r\nfor the wine they drink; and he may go out and cry the wine at the\r\nprices they pay, whether the tavern-keeper wishes it or not, provided\r\nalways that there be no other crier employed for that tavern.\r\n\r\n“If a tavern-keeper sells wine in Paris and employs no crier, and closes\r\nhis door against the criers, the crier may proclaim that\r\ntavern-keeper’s wine at the same price as the king’s wine (the current\r\nprice), that is to say, if it be a good wine year, at seven denarii, and\r\nif it be a bad wine year, at twelve denarii.\r\n\r\n“Each crier to receive daily from the tavern for which he cries at least\r\nfour denarii, and he is bound on his oath not to claim more.\r\n\r\n“The crier shall go about crying twice a day, except in Lent, on Sundays\r\nand Fridays, the eight days of Christmas, and the Vigils, when they\r\nshall only cry once. On the Friday of the Adoration of the Cross they\r\nshall cry not at all. Neither are they to cry on the day on which the\r\nking, the queen, or any of the children of the royal family happens to\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\nThis crying of wines is frequently alluded to in those French ballads of\r\nstreet-criers known as “Les crieries de Paris.” One of them has--\r\n\r\n    Si crie l’on en plusors leus\r\n    Li bon vin fort a trente deux,\r\n    A seize, a douze, a six, a huict.[16]\r\n\r\nAnd another--\r\n\r\n    D’autres cris on faict plusieurs,\r\n    Qui long seroient à reciter,\r\n    L’on crie vin nouveau et vieu,\r\n    Duquel on donne à tatter.[17]\r\n\r\nEarly in the Middle Ages the public crier was still called _Præco_, as\r\namong the Romans; and an edict of the town of Tournay, dated 1368,\r\ndescribes him as “the sergeant of the rod (_sergent à verge_), who makes\r\npublications (_crie les bans_), and cries whatever else there is to be\r\nmade known to the town.” The Assizes of Jerusalem, which contained the\r\ncode of civil laws of the whole of civilised Europe during the twelfth\r\nand thirteenth centuries, and which take us back to the most ancient\r\nforms of our own civil institutions, make mention in the following\r\nmanner of the public crier: “Whosoever desires to sell anything by\r\nauction, must have it proclaimed by the crier, who is appointed by the\r\nlord viscount; and nobody else has a right to make any publication by\r\ncrying. If anybody causes any such auction to be proclaimed by any other\r\nthan the public crier, then the lord has a right by assize and custom to\r\nclaim the property so cried as his own, and the crier shall be at the\r\nmercy of the lord. And whoever causes anything to be cried by the\r\nappointed public crier in any other way than it ought to be cried, and\r\nin any other way than is done by the lord or his representative, the\r\nlord may claim the property as his own, and the crier who thus cries it\r\nshall be amenable for falsehood, and is at the mercy of the lord, who\r\nmay take from him all he possesses. But if he [the lord] does not do\r\nthat, then he shall not suffer any other punishment; and if he be\r\ncharged, he must be believed on his oath.”\r\n\r\nFrom these very stringent and protective regulations it appears, then,\r\nthat at this early period the public criers, or _præcones_, appointed by\r\nthe lord, had the exclusive right of proclaiming all sales by auction,\r\nnot only voluntary, but also judicial, of movables, as well as of\r\nfixtures; of “personal,” as well as of “real” property.\r\n\r\nIn England criers appear to have been also a national institution at an\r\nearly period. They were sworn to sell truly and well to the best of\r\ntheir power and ability. They proclaimed the cause of the condemnation\r\nof all criminals, and made proclamations of every kind, except as\r\nconcerned matters ecclesiastical, which were exclusively the province of\r\nthe archbishop. They also cried all kinds of goods. In London we find\r\nEdmund le Criour mentioned in the documents relating to the Guildhall as\r\nearly as 1299. That criers used horns, as in France, appears from the\r\nwill of a citizen of Bristol, dated 1388, who, disposing of some house\r\nproperty, desires “that the tenements so bequeathed shall be sold\r\nseparately by the sound of the trumpet at the high cross of Bristol,\r\nwithout any fraud or collusion.” In Ipswich it was still customary in\r\nthe last century to proclaim the meetings of the town council, the\r\nprevious night at twelve o’clock, by the sound of a large horn, which is\r\nstill preserved in the town hall of that borough. These horns were\r\nprovided by the mayors of the different towns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: O PER SE O, OR A NEW CRYER.\r\n\r\n“THE BELMAN OF LONDON.”\r\n\r\n_From_ _Thomas Decker’s Lanthorne and Candle Light; or, The Bell-Man’s\r\nSecond Night’s Walke._ 1608-9.]\r\n\r\nThe public crier, then, was the chief organ by which the mediæval\r\nshopkeeper, in the absence of what we now know as “advertising mediums,”\r\nobtained publicity: it was also customary for most traders to have\r\ntouters at their doors, who did duty as living advertisements. In low\r\nneighbourhoods this system still obtains, especially in connection with\r\ncheap photographic establishments, whose “doorsmen” select as a rule the\r\nmost improbable people for their attentions, but compensate for this by\r\ntheir pertinacity and glibness. Possibly the triumph is the greater when\r\nthe customer has been persuaded quite out of his or her original\r\nintentions. Most trades, in early times, were almost exclusively\r\nconfined to certain streets, and as all the shops were alike\r\nunpretending, and open to the gaze--in fact, were stalls or booths--it\r\nbehoved the shopkeeper to do something in order to attract customers.\r\nThis he effected sometimes by means of a glaring sign, sometimes by\r\nmeans of a man or youth standing at the door, and vociferating with the\r\nfull power of his lungs, “What d’ye lack, sir? what d’ye lack?” Our\r\ncountry is rather deficient in that kind of mediæval literature known in\r\nFrance as _dicts_ and _fabliaux_, which teem with allusions to this\r\ncustom of touting, which is noticeable, though, in Lydgate’s ballad of\r\n“London Lyckpenny” (Lack-penny), written in the first half of the\r\nfifteenth century. There we see the shopmen standing at the door, trying\r\nto outbawl each other to gain the custom of the passers-by. The spicer\r\nor grocer bids the Kentish countryman to come and buy some spice,\r\npepper, or saffron. In Cheapside, the mercers bewilder him with their\r\nvelvet, silk, and lawn, and lay violent hands on him, in order to show\r\nhim their “Paris thread, the finest in the land.” Throughout all Canwick\r\n(now Cannon Street), he is persecuted by drapers, who offer him cloth;\r\nand in other parts, particularly in East Cheap, the keepers of the\r\neating-houses sorely tempt him with their cries of “Hot sheep’s feet,\r\nfresh maqurel, pies, and ribs of beef.” At last he falls a prey to the\r\ntempting invitation of a taverner, who makes up to him from his door\r\nwith a cringing bow, and taking him by the sleeve, pronounces the words,\r\n“Sir, will you try our wine?” with such an insinuating and irresistible\r\naccent, that the Kentish man enters and spends his only penny in that\r\ntempting and hospitable house. Worthy old Stow supposes this interesting\r\nincident to have happened at the Pope’s Head, in Cornhill, and bids us\r\nenjoy the knowledge of the fact, that for his one penny the countryman\r\nhad a pint of wine, and “for bread nothing did he pay, for that was\r\nallowed free” in those good old days. Free luncheons, though rare now,\r\nwere commonly bestowed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries on\r\nregular drinkers; and the practice of giving food to those who pay for\r\ndrink is still current in many parts of the United States. The\r\n“Lyckpenny” story is one of the few instances in English literature of\r\nthis early period, in which the custom of touting at shop doors is\r\ndistinctly mentioned, but, as before remarked, the French _fabliaux_\r\nabound with such allusions. In the story of “Courtois d’Arras”--a\r\ntravestie of the Prodigal Son in a thirteenth-century garb--Courtois\r\nfinds the host standing at his door shouting, “Bon vin de Soissons, à\r\nsix deniers le lot.” And in a mediæval mystery entitled “Li Jus de S.\r\nNicolas,” the innkeeper, standing on the threshold, roars out, that in\r\nhis house excellent dinners are to be had, with warm bread and warm\r\nherrings, and barrelfuls of Auxerre wine: “Céans il fait bon diner,\r\ncéans il y a pain chaud et harengs chauds, et vin d’Auxerre à plein\r\ntonneau.” In the “Trois Aveugles de Compiègne,” the thirsty wanderers\r\nhear mine host proclaiming in the street that he has “good, cool, and\r\nnew wine, from Auxerre and from Soissons; bread and meat, and wine and\r\nfish: within is a good place to spend your money; within is\r\naccommodation for all kind of people; here is good lodging:”--\r\n\r\n    Ci a bon vin fres et nouvel\r\n    Ça d’Auxerre, ça de Soissons,\r\n    Pain, et char, et vin, et poissons,\r\n    Céens fet bon despendre argent,\r\n    Ostel i a à toute gent\r\n    Céens fet moult bon heberger.\r\n\r\nAnd in the “Débats et facétieuses rencontres de Gringald et de Guillot\r\nGorgen, son maistre,” the servant, who would not pay his reckoning,\r\nexcuses himself, saying, “The taverner is more to blame than I, for as I\r\npassed before his door, and he being seated at it as usual, called to\r\nme, saying, ‘Will you be pleased to breakfast here? I have good bread,\r\ngood wine, and good meat.’” “Le tavernier a plus de tort que moy; car,\r\npassant devant sa porte, et luy étant assiz (ainsy qu’ils sont\r\nordinairement) il me cria, me disant: Vous plaist-il de dejeuner céans?\r\nIl y a de bon pain, de bon vin, et de bonne viande.”\r\n\r\nOther modes of advertising, of a less obtrusive nature, were, however,\r\nin use at the same time; as in Rome, written handbills were affixed in\r\npublic places; and almost as soon as the art of printing was discovered,\r\nit was applied to the purpose of multiplying advertisements of this\r\nkind. We may fairly assume that one of the very first posters ever\r\nprinted in England was that by which Caxton announced, circa 1480, the\r\nsale of the “Pyes of Salisbury use,”[18] at the Red Pole, in the\r\nAlmonry, Westminster. Of this first of broadsides two copies are still\r\nextant, one in the Bodleian Library, at Oxford, the other in Earl\r\nSpencer’s library. Their dimensions are five inches by seven, and their\r\ncontents as follows:--\r\n\r\n  ^If it please ony man spirituel or temporel to bye our pyes of two or\r\n  thre comemoracio’s of Salisburi use, emprynted after the form of this\r\n  prese’t letre, whiche ben wel and truly correct, late hym come to\r\n  Westmonester, into the almonestrye at the reed pole and he shal haue\r\n  them good and chepe:^\r\n\r\n  ^Supplico stet cedula.^\r\n\r\nForeigners appear to have appreciated the boon of this kind of\r\nadvertising equally rapidly, although, from the fugitive nature of such\r\nproductions, copies of their posters are rarely to be found. Still an\r\ninteresting list of books, printed by Coburger at Nuremberg in the\r\nfifteenth century, is preserved in the British Museum, to which is\r\nattached the following heading: “Cupientes emere libros infra notatos\r\nvenient ad hospitium subnotatum,” &c.--_i.e._, “Those who wish to buy\r\nthe books hereunder mentioned, must come to the house now named,” &c.\r\nThe Parisian printers soon went a step further. Long before the\r\ninvention of the typographic art, the University had compelled the\r\nbooksellers to advertise in their shop windows any new manuscripts they\r\nmight obtain. But after the invention of printing they soon commenced to\r\nproclaim the wonderful cheapness of the works they produced. It did not\r\nstrike them, however, that this might have been done effectually on a\r\nlarge scale, and they were content to extol the low price of the work in\r\nthe book itself. Such notices as the following are common in early\r\nbooks. Ulric Gering, in his “Corpus Juris Canonici,” 1500, allays the\r\nfear of the public with a distich:--“Don’t run away on account of the\r\nprice,” he says. “Come rich and poor; this excellent work is sold for a\r\nvery small sum:”--\r\n\r\n    Ne fugite ob pretium: dives pauperque venite\r\n    Hoc opus excellens venditur ære brevi.\r\n\r\nBerthold Remboldt subjoins to his edition of “S. Bruno on the Psalms,”\r\n1509, the information that he does not lock away his wares (books) like\r\na miser, but that anybody can carry them away for very little money.\r\n\r\n    Istas Bertholdus merces non claudit avarus\r\n    Exiguis nummis has studiose geres.\r\n\r\nAnd in his “Corpus Juris Canonici,” he boasts that this splendid volume\r\nis to be had for a trifling sum, after having, with considerable labour,\r\nbeen weeded of its misprints.\r\n\r\n    Hoc tibi præclarum modico patet ære volumen\r\n    Abstersum mendis non sine Marte suis.\r\n\r\nThielman Kerver, Jean Petit, and various other printers, give similar\r\nintelligence to the purchasers of their works. Sometimes they even\r\nresort to the process of having a book puffed on account of its\r\ncheapness by editors or scholars of known eminence, who address the\r\npublic on behalf of the printer. Thus in a work termed by the French\r\nsavant Chevillier, “Les Opuscules du Docteur Almain,” printed by\r\nChevalon and Gourmont, 1518, a certain dignified member of the\r\nUniversity condescends to inform the public that they have to be\r\ngrateful to the publishers for the beautiful and cheap book they have\r\nproduced:--“Gratias agant Claudio Chevallon et Ægydio Gourmont, qui\r\npulchris typis et characteribus impressum opus hoc vili dant pretio.”\r\nThis, be it observed, is the earliest instance of the puff direct which\r\nhas so far been discovered.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, though the art of printing had become established, and was\r\ndaily taking more and more work out of the hands of scribes, writing\r\ncontinued to be almost the only advertising media for wellnigh two\r\ncenturies longer. Like the ancient advertisement already noticed, that\r\nof Venus about her runaway son, they commenced almost invariably with\r\nthe words “If anybody,” or, if in Latin, _Si quis_; and from these last\r\ntwo words they obtained their name. They were posted in the most\r\nfrequented parts of the towns, preferably near churches; and hence has\r\nsurvived the practice of attaching to church doors lists of voters and\r\nvarious other notifications, particularly in villages. In the metropolis\r\none of the places used for this purpose may probably have been London\r\nStone. In “Pasquil and Marforius,” 1589, we read, “Set up this bill at\r\nLondon Stone; let it be done solemnly with drum and trumpet;” and\r\nfurther on in the same pamphlet, “If it please them, these dark winter\r\nnights, to stick up these papers upon London Stone.” These two allusions\r\nare, however, not particularly conclusive.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the principal place for\r\naffixing a _siquis_ was in the middle aisle of St Paul’s. From the era\r\nof the Reformation to the Restoration, all sorts of disorderly conduct\r\nwas practised in the old cathedral. A lengthy catalogue of improper\r\ncustoms and disgusting practices might be collected from the works of\r\nthe period, and bills were stuck up in various parts to restrain the\r\ngrossest abuses. “At every door of this church,” says Weever, “was\r\nanciently this vers depicted; and in my time [he died in 1632] it might\r\nbe perfectly read at the great south door, _Hic Locus sacer est, hic\r\nnulli mingere fas est_.”\r\n\r\nThere were also within the sacred edifice tobacco, book, and sempstress’\r\nshops; there was a pillar at which serving-men stood for hire, and\r\nanother place where lawyers had their regular stands, like merchants on\r\n’Change. At the period when Decker wrote his curious “Gull’s Horn-Book”\r\n(1609), and for many years after, the cathedral was the lounging place\r\nfor all idlers and hunters after news, as well as of men of almost\r\nevery profession, cheats, usurers, and knights of the post. The\r\ncathedral was likewise a seat of traffic and negotiation, even pimps and\r\nprocuresses had their stations there; and the font itself, if credit may\r\nbe given to a black-letter tract on the “Detestable Use of Dice-play,”\r\nprinted early in Elizabeth’s reign, was made a place for the advance and\r\npayment of loans, and the sealing of indentures and obligations for the\r\nsecurity of the moneys borrowed. Such a busy haunt was, of course, the\r\nvery best place for bills and advertisements to be posted.\r\n\r\nNo bonâ fide _siquis_ has come down to us, but it appears that among\r\nthem the applications for ecclesiastics were very common, as Bishop\r\nEarle in his “Microcosmographia,” published in 1629, describes “Paul’s\r\nWalke” as the “market of young lecturers, whom you may cheapen here at\r\nall rates and sizes;” and this allusion is confirmed by a passage in\r\nBishop Hall’s “Satires” (B. ii. s. 5), in which also the custom of\r\naffixing advertisements to a particular door is distinctly noticed:--\r\n\r\n    Saw’st thou ere _siquis_ patch’d on Paul’s church door\r\n    To seek some vacant vicarage before?\r\n    Who wants a churchman that can service say,\r\n    Read fast and fair his monthly homily,\r\n    And wed, and bury, and make cristen souls,\r\n    Come to the _left side alley_ of St Poule’s.\r\n\r\nBut the _siquis_ door was not confined to notices of ecclesiastical\r\nmatters; it was appropriated generally to the variety of applications\r\nthat is now to be found in the columns of a newspaper or the books of a\r\nregistry office. Though no authentic specimens of the _siquis_ remain,\r\nwe are possessed of several imitations, as the old dramatists delighted\r\nin reproducing the inflated language of these documents. Thus, in\r\nHoliday’s “Technogamia” (1618), Act i. scene 7, Geographus sets up the\r\nfollowing notice:--\r\n\r\n  If there be any gentleman that, for the accomplishing of his natural\r\n  endowment, intertaynes a desire of learning the languages; especially\r\n  the nimble French, maiestik Spanish, courtly Italian, masculine Dutch,\r\n  happily compounding Greek, mysticall Hebrew, and physicall Arabicke;\r\n  or that is otherwise transported with the admirable knowledge of\r\n  forraine policies, complimentall behaviour, naturall dispositions, or\r\n  whatsoever else belongs to any people or country under heaven; he\r\n  shall, to his abundant satisfaction, be made happy in his expectation\r\n  and successe if he please to repair to the signe of the Globe.\r\n\r\nAgain, Ben Jonson’s “Every Man out of his Humour” introduces Shift, “a\r\nthreadbare shark,” whose “profession is skeldring and odling, his bank\r\nPaul’s.” Speaking of Shift in the opening scene of the third act, which\r\nthe dramatist has laid in “the middle aisle of Paules,” Cordatus says\r\nthat Shift is at that moment in Paules “for the advancement of a\r\n_siquis_ or two, wherein he hath so varied himselfe, that if any one of\r\nthem take, he may hull up and doune in the humorous world a little\r\nlonger.” Shift’s productions deserved to succeed, as they were\r\nmasterpieces of their kind, and might even now, though the world is so\r\nmuch older, and professes to be so much wiser, be studied with advantage\r\nby gentlemen who cultivate the literature of advertisements in the\r\ninterest of certain firms. Here are some of his compositions, which\r\nwould certainly shine among the examples of the present day:--\r\n\r\n  If there be any lady or gentlewoman of good carriage that is desirous\r\n  to entertain to her private uses a young, straight, and upright\r\n  gentleman, of the age of five or six and twenty at the most; who can\r\n  serve in the nature of a gentleman usher, and hath little legs of\r\n  purpose,[19] and a black satin suit of his own to go before her in;\r\n  which suit, for the more sweetening, now lies in lavender;[20] and can\r\n  hide his face with her fan if need require, or sit in the cold at the\r\n  stair foot for her, as well as another gentleman; let her subscribe\r\n  her name and place, and diligent respect shall be given.\r\n\r\nThe following is even an improvement:--\r\n\r\n  If this city, or the suburbs of the same, do afford any young\r\n  gentleman of the first, second, or third head, more or less, whose\r\n  friends are but lately deceased, and whose lands are but new come into\r\n  his hands, that, to be as exactly qualified as the best of our\r\n  ordinary gallants are, is affected to entertain the most gentlemanlike\r\n  use of tobacco; as first to give it the most exquisite perfume; then\r\n  to know all the delicate, sweet forms for the assumption of it; as\r\n  also the rare corollary and practice of the Cuban ebolition, euripus\r\n  and whiff,[21] which we shall receive or take in here at London, and\r\n  evaporate at Uxbridge, or farther, if it please him. If there be any\r\n  such generous spirit, that is truly enamour’d of these good faculties;\r\n  may it please him but by a note of his hand to specify the place or\r\n  ordinary where he uses to eat and lie; and most sweet attendance with\r\n  tobacco and pipes of the best sort, shall be ministered. _Stet quæso,\r\n  candide lector._\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that most of these advertisements commence with the\r\nEnglish equivalent for the Latin _si quis_, and furthermore that Ben\r\nJonson concludes with the same formula as Caxton, _stet quæso_,\r\nimploring the “candid reader” not to tear off the bill. The word\r\n_siquis_ is of frequent occurrence in the old writers. Green, for\r\ninstance, in his “Tu Quoque,” says of certain women that “they stand\r\nlike the devil’s _siquis_ at a tavern or alehouse door.” At present the\r\nterm has more particular reference to ecclesiastical matters. A\r\ncandidate for holy orders who has not been educated at the University,\r\nor has been absent some time from thence, is still obliged to have his\r\nintention proclaimed, by having a notice to that effect hung up in the\r\nchurch of the place where he has recently resided. If, after a certain\r\ntime, no objection is made, a certificate of his _siquis_, signed by the\r\nchurchwardens, is given to him to be presented to the bishop when he\r\nseeks ordination.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the _siquis_ was the most common form of\r\nadvertisement, other methods were used in order to give publicity to\r\ncertain events. There were the proclamations of the will of the King,\r\nand of the Lord Mayor, whose edicts were proclaimed by the common\r\ntrumpeter. There were also two richly carved and gilt posts at the door\r\nof the Sheriff’s office,[22] on which (some annotators of old plays say)\r\nit was customary to stick enactments of the Town Council. The common\r\ncrier further made known matters of minor and commercial importance, and\r\nevery shopkeeper still kept an apprentice at his door to attract the\r\nattention of the passers-by with a continuous “What do you lack,\r\nmaster?” or “mistress,” followed by a voluble enumeration of the wares\r\nvended by his master. The bookseller, as in ancient Rome, still\r\nadvertised his new works by placards posted against his shop, or fixed\r\nin cleft sticks. This we gather from an epigram of Ben Jonson to his\r\nbookseller, in which he enjoins him rather to sell his works to\r\nBucklersbury, to be used for wrappers and bags, than to force their sale\r\nby the usual means:--\r\n\r\n    Nor have my little leaf on post or walls,\r\n    Or in cleft sticks advancèd to make calls\r\n    For termers or some clerk-like serving-man.\r\n\r\nAnnouncements of shows were given in the manner still followed by the\r\nequestrian circus troops in provincial towns, viz., by means of bills\r\nand processions. Thus notice of bearbaitings was given by the bears\r\nbeing led about the town, preceded by a flag and some noisy instruments.\r\nIn the Duke of Newcastle’s play of “The Humorous Lovers” (1677), the\r\nsham bearward says, “I’ll set up my bills, that the gamesters of London,\r\nHorseleydown, Southwark, and Newmarket, may come in and bait him before\r\nthe ladies. But first, boy, go, fetch me a bagpipe; we will walk the\r\nstreets in triumph, and give the people notice of our sport.” Such a\r\nprocession was, of course, a noisy one, and for that reason it was one\r\nof the plagues the mischievous page sent to torment Morose, “the\r\ngentleman that loves no noise,” in Ben Jonson’s “Silent Woman.” “I\r\nentreated a bearward one day,” says the page, “to come down with the\r\ndogs of some four parishes that way, and I thank him he did, and cried\r\nhis game under Master Morose’s window.” And in Howard’s “English\r\nMonsieur” (1674), William, a country youth, says, “I saw two\r\nrough-haired things led by the nose with two strings, and a bull like\r\nours in the country, with a brave garland about his head, and an horse,\r\nand the least gentleman upon him that ever I saw in my life, and brave\r\nbagpipes playing before ’um;” which is explained by Comely as occasioned\r\nby its being “bearbaiting day, and he has met with the bull, and the\r\nbears, and the jack-an-apes on horseback.” Trials of skill in the noble\r\nart of self-defence were announced in a similar manner, by the\r\ncombatants promenading the streets divested of their upper garments,\r\nwith their sleeves tucked up, sword or cudgel in hand, and preceded by a\r\ndrum. Finally, for the use of the community at large, there was the\r\nbellman or town crier, a character which occupies a prominent place in\r\nall the old sets of “Cries of London.” In one of the earliest\r\ncollections of that kind,[23] engraved early in the seventeenth century,\r\nwe see him represented with a bunch of keys in his hand, which he no\r\ndoubt proclaims as “found.” Underneath is the following “notice:”--\r\n\r\n    O yes. Any man or woman that\r\n    Can tell any tidings of a little\r\n    Mayden-childe of the age of 24\r\n    Yeares. Bring word to the cryar\r\n    And you shall be pleased for your labour\r\n    And God’s blessing.\r\n\r\nThis was an old joke, which, more or less varied, occurs always under\r\nthe print of the town crier. The prototype of this venerable witticism\r\nmay be found in the tragedy of “Soliman and Perseda” (1599), where one\r\nof the characters says that he\r\n\r\n                                 ------ had but sixpence\r\n    For crying a little wench of thirty yeeres old and upwardes,\r\n    That had lost herself betwixt a taverne and a b----y house.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the immense development of advertising since the spread\r\nof newspapers, the services of the bellman are still used in most of the\r\ncountry towns of the United Kingdom, and even in London there are still\r\nbellmen and parish criers, though their offices would appear to be\r\nsinecures. The provincial crier’s duties are of the most various\r\ndescription, and relate to objects lost or found, sales by public\r\nauction or private contract, weddings, christenings, and funerals. Not\r\nmuch more than a century ago the burgh of Lanark was so poor that there\r\nwas in it only one butcher, and even he dared never venture on killing a\r\nsheep till every part of the animal was ordered beforehand. When he felt\r\ndisposed to engage in such an enterprise, he usually prevailed upon the\r\nminister, the provost, and the members of the town council to take a\r\njoint each; but when shares were not subscribed for readily, the sheep\r\nreceived a respite. On such occasion the services of the bellman, or\r\n“skelligman,” as he was there named, were called into request, and that\r\nofficial used to perambulate the streets of Lanark acquainting the\r\nlieges with the butcher’s intentions in the following rhyme:--\r\n\r\n            Bell-ell-ell!\r\n          There’s a fat sheep to kill!\r\n          A leg for the provost,\r\n            Another for the priest,\r\n          The bailies and the deacons\r\n            They’ll tak’ the neist;\r\n    And if the fourth leg we canna sell,\r\n    The sheep it maun leeve, and gae back to the hill!\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott, in one of his notes, gives a quaint specimen of vocal\r\nadvertising. In the old days of Scotland, when persons of property\r\n(unless they happened to be nonjurors) were as regular as their\r\ninferiors in attendance on parochial worship, there was a kind of\r\netiquette in waiting till the patron, or acknowledged great man of the\r\nparish, should make his appearance. This ceremonial was so sacred in the\r\neyes of a parish beadle in the Isle of Bute, that the kirk bell being\r\nout of order, he is said to have mounted the steeple every Sunday to\r\nimitate with his voice the successive summonses which its mouth of metal\r\nused to send forth. The first part of this imitative harmony was simply\r\nthe repetition of the words, “Bell, bell, bell, bell!” two or three\r\ntimes, in a manner as much resembling the sound as throat of flesh could\r\nimitate throat of iron. “Bellùm, Bellùm!” was sounded forth in a more\r\nurgent manner; but he never sent forth the third and conclusive peal,\r\nthe varied tone of which is called in Scotland the “ringing-in,” until\r\nthe two principal heritors of the parish approached, when the chime ran\r\nthus--\r\n\r\n          Bellùm Bellèllum,\r\n    Bernera and Knockdow’s coming!\r\n          Bellùm Bellèllum,\r\n    Bernera and Knockdow’s coming!\r\n\r\nA story is also told of an old Welsh beadle, who, having no bell to his\r\nchurch, or the bell being out of order, used to mount the tower before\r\nthe service on Sundays, and advertise the fact that they were just about\r\nto begin, in imitation of the chimes, and in compliment to the most\r\nconspicuous patronymics in the congregation list, thus--\r\n\r\n          Shon Morgan, Shon Shones,\r\n          Shon Morgan, Shon Shones,\r\n    Shon Shenkin, Shon Morgan, Shon Shenkin,\r\n                Shon Shones!\r\n\r\nContinued _à discretion_. And with this most singular form of vocal\r\nadvertising we will conclude the chapter.\r\n\r\n  [14] Glossary, cap. xxvii. “Wine-criers cry with open mouth the wine\r\n  which is for sale in the taverns at four farthings.”\r\n\r\n  [15] Chronicles of the Monk Alberic des Trois Fontaines, under the\r\n  year 1235.\r\n\r\n  [16] All around here they cry wine at the rate\r\n       Of thirty-two, sixteen, twelve, six, and eight.\r\n\r\n  [17] To name the other cries our time would waste--\r\n       They cry old wine and new, and bid you taste.\r\n\r\n  [18] No savoury meat-pies, as some gastronomic reader might think,\r\n  since they came from the county of sausage celebrity, but a collection\r\n  of rules, as practised in the diocese of Salisbury, to show the\r\n  priests how to deal, under every possible variation in Easter, with\r\n  the concurrence of more than one office on the same day. These rules\r\n  varied in the different dioceses.\r\n\r\n  [19] Small calveless legs are mentioned as characteristic of a\r\n  gentleman in many of our old plays, and will be observed in most\r\n  full-length portraits of the sixteenth and seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n  [20] To “lie in lavender” was a cant term for being in pawn.\r\n\r\n  [21] Tricks performed with tobacco smoke were fashionable amongst the\r\n  gallants of the period, and are recommended in Decker’s “Gull’s\r\n  Horn-Book,” and commended in many old plays. Making rings of smoke was\r\n  a favourite amusement in those days.\r\n\r\n  [22] See prints in “Archæologia,” xix. p. 383.\r\n\r\n  [23] _Vide_ Decker’s “Belman of London: Bringing to Light the most\r\n  notorious Villanies that are now practised in the Kingdome.” London,\r\n  1608.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING FORESHADOWED--ITS EARLIEST USE--HOUGHTON’S\r\nLESSONS._\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time, and in various ways, the first transitory glimpses of a\r\nsystem at present all-powerful and universal began to show\r\nthemselves--vague and uncertain, and often unsatisfactory, it must be\r\nadmitted, but still the first evidences of the growth of an unparalleled\r\ninstitution; in fact, the base upon which the institution eventually\r\nreared itself. With improvements in printing, and the invention of\r\nmovable type, the supply of pamphlets on current topics--the first rude\r\nforerunners of the newspaper as we understand it--began to be enlarged,\r\nand this opportunity was not lost on the bold spirits who even in those\r\ndays could understand the advantages bound to accrue from a system of\r\nintercommunication at once advantageous to buyer and seller, and calling\r\nfor special attention from both. There is a wonderful amount of\r\nattraction about these discoloured and moth-eaten papers, with their\r\nrude types and quaint spelling, which breathe, as much as do the words\r\nthemselves, the spirit of a bygone age, and those who are so fond of\r\npraising past times might receive a valuable lesson from the perusal of\r\nthese occasional publications, which are full of the spirit of an age\r\nwhen comfort, as we understand the word, was unknown to even the\r\nwealthy; when travelling was a luxury--a woeful luxury, it must be\r\nadmitted--known only to those possessed of ample means, or others called\r\nforth on special or desperate missions; when men lived long, and, as\r\nthey thought, eventful lives, within a circle of half-a-dozen miles; and\r\nwhen the natural consequences of this isolation, ignorance and\r\nintolerance, held almost absolute sway over the length and breadth of\r\nthe land. And in these old papers, as we get nearer and nearer to modern\r\ntimes, can be traced the gradual benefit which accrued from man’s\r\nintercourse with man, not only by the construction and improvement of\r\nroads, and the introduction of and competition among stage coaches, but\r\nby means of the subject of this work,--and very much by their means\r\ntoo,--advertisements.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1524, pamphlets or small books of news were printed in\r\nVienna and other parts of Germany, but their publication was very\r\nirregular, and little or nothing is known of them beyond the fact of\r\ntheir being. It is not easy to determine which nation first found its\r\nway towards newspaper advertisements, but there is good reason to\r\nbelieve that France is entitled to the honour, so far as regular and\r\nconsecutive business is concerned. The _Journal Général d’Affiches_,\r\nbetter known as the _Petites Affiches_, was first published on the 14th\r\nof October 1612. It obtained from Louis XIII. by letters-patent sundry\r\nprivileges which were subsequently confirmed (1628 and 1635). Judging by\r\nthe title of this publication, it would appear to have been an\r\nadvertising medium, but this must be left to surmise, there being no\r\nopportunity, so far as we are aware, of inspecting the earliest numbers.\r\nTwo centuries and a half have passed away since the first appearance of\r\nthis periodical, and the _Petites Affiches_ has neither changed its\r\ntitle, nor, it may be fairly presumed, the nature of its publicity. It\r\nis now the journal of the domestic wants of France; and servants seeking\r\nsituations, or persons wanting servants, advertise in it in preference\r\nto all others. It is especially the medium for announcing any public or\r\nprivate sales of property, real or personal; and the publication of\r\npartnership deeds, articles of association of public companies, and\r\nother legal notices, are required to be inserted in the _Journal des\r\nPetites Affiches_, which is published in a small octavo form.\r\n\r\nThe oldest newspaper paragraph approaching to an advertisement yet met\r\nwith, is in one of those early German newsbooks preserved in the British\r\nMuseum. It is printed in 1591, without name of place, and contains all\r\nthe memorable occurrences of the years 1588 and 1589, such as the defeat\r\nof the Armada, the murder of King Henry III. of France, and other stale\r\nmatter of the same kind; a curious instance of the tardiness with which\r\nnews, whether good or ill, travelled in those times. Among the many\r\nsigns and tokens which were then supposed to give warning of divine\r\nwrath at the general wickedness of mankind, was an unknown plant which\r\nhad made its appearance in one of the suburbs of the town of Soltwedel.\r\nIt grew in a garden amongst other plants, but nobody had ever seen its\r\nlike. A certain Dr Laster thereupon wrote a book describing the plant,\r\nand giving a print of it in the frontispiece. “This book,” says the\r\npamphlet, “which as yet is not much known, shows and explains all what\r\nthis plant contains. Magister Cunan has published it, and Matthew Welack\r\nhas printed it, in Wittemberg. Let whoever does not yet know the meaning\r\nof this [portend] buy the book at once, and read it with all possible\r\nzeal:”--\r\n\r\n    Ein wunderlichs Gewechs man hat,\r\n      Von Soltwedel der Alten stad,\r\n    Der Berber die Vorstadt genand,\r\n      Gefunden welchs gar niemand kend.\r\n    In einem Garten gewachsen ist,\r\n      Bey andern Kreutern ist gewis,\r\n    Sein Conterfey und recht gestalt,\r\n      Wird auffm Tittel gezeiget bald,\r\n    Ein Buch Hoffarts Laster genand,\r\n      Welches jetzt noch sehr unbekand\r\n    Darin gewiesen und vermied,\r\n      Was das gewechse in sich hilt,\r\n    Mag: Cunaw hats geben an den Tag\r\n      Zu Wittemberg druckts Matths Welack,\r\n    Wer des bedeutung noch nicht weis\r\n      Kauff das Buch lisz mit allem fleis.\r\n\r\nThough this is an advertisement to all intents and purposes, still it is\r\nof the kind now best known amongst those most interested as “puff pars,”\r\nand is similar to those that the early booksellers frequently inserted\r\nin their works. It is therefore not unlikely that the book in question\r\nand the newsletter were printed at the same shop. Another, in fact,\r\n_the_ earliest instance of newspaper advertising, is that of Nathaniel\r\nButler; still this also only relates to books. The first genuine\r\nmiscellaneous advertisements yet discovered occur in a Dutch\r\nblack-letter newspaper, which was published in the reign of our James\r\nI., without name or title. The advertisement in question is inserted at\r\nthe end of the folio half-sheet which contains the news, November 21,\r\n1626, and, in a type different from the rest of the paper, gives notice\r\nthat there will be held a sale by auction of articles taken out of\r\nprizes, viz., sugar, ivory, pepper, tobacco, and logwood. At that time\r\nthere appeared two newspapers in Amsterdam, and it is not a little\r\ncurious that Broer Jansz[24] occasionally advertised the books he\r\npublished in the paper of his rival, which was entitled “Courant from\r\nItaly and Germany.” Gradually the advertisements become more frequent,\r\nthe following being some of them literally translated. The first is from\r\nthe _Courante uyt Italien ende Duytschland_ of July 23, 1633:--\r\n\r\n  With the last ships from the East Indies have been brought an\r\n  elephant, a tiger, and an Indian stag, which are to be seen at the Old\r\n  Glass house, for the benefit of the poor, where many thousands of\r\n  people visit them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The _Hollandsche Mercurius_, which was issued more than\r\ntwo hundred years ago, showed great interest in English affairs,\r\nespecially with regard to the Civil War. It was much inclined to the\r\nRoyal cause; and when in 1653 Cromwell assumed supreme power, the above\r\nwas issued as a title, and purported to show the various events which\r\nhad recently passed in Great Britain.]\r\n\r\n  The heirs of the late Mr Bernardus Paludanus, Doctor, of the City of\r\n  Enkhuyzen, will sell his world-famed museum in lots, by public\r\n  auction, or by private contract, on the 1st of August, 1634.\r\n\r\nThe two following are taken from the _Tydinghen_, the first appearing on\r\nMay 27, 1634:--\r\n\r\n  The Burgomasters and Council of the town of Utrecht have been pleased\r\n  to found in this old and famous town, an illustrious school\r\n  [university], at which will be taught and explained the sacred\r\n  Theology and Jurisprudence, besides Philosophy, History, and similar\r\n  sciences. And it will commence and open at Whitsuntide of this present\r\n  year.\r\n\r\nA few days after, on June 7th, the inauguration of this school is\r\nadvertised as about to take place on the ensuing Tuesday. There is one\r\ninstance of an advertisement from a foreign country being inserted in\r\nthis paper; it runs as follows, and is dated June 2, 1635:--\r\n\r\n  Licentiate Grim, British preacher and professor at the University of\r\n  Wesel, has published an extensive treatise against all popish\r\n  scribblers, entitled “Papal Sanctimony,” that is, catholic and\r\n  authentic proof that Pope John VIII., commonly called Pope Jutte\r\n  [Joan], was a woman.\r\n\r\nIn England the first bonâ fide attempt at newspaper work was attempted\r\nin 1622, when the outbreak of the great Civil War caused an unusual\r\ndemand to be made for news, and as the appetite grew by what it fed on,\r\nthis unwonted request for information may be regarded as the\r\nfount-spring of that vast machine which “liners” delight to call “the\r\nfourth estate.” It was this demand which suggested to one Nathaniel\r\nButler, a bookseller and a pamphleteer of twelve years’ standing, the\r\nidea of printing a weekly newspaper from the Venetian gazettes, which\r\nused to circulate in manuscript. After one or two preliminary attempts,\r\nhe acquired sufficient confidence in his publication to issue the\r\nfollowing advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  If any gentleman or other accustomed to buy the weekly relations of\r\n  newes be desirous to continue the same, let them know that the writer,\r\n  or transcriber rather, of this newes, hath published two former newes,\r\n  the one dated the 2nd and the other the 13th of August, all of which\r\n  do carry a like title with the arms of the King of Bohemia on the\r\n  other side of the title-page, and have dependence one upon another:\r\n  which manner of writing and printing he doth purpose to continue\r\n  weekly by God’s assistance from the best and most certain\r\n  intelligence: farewell, this twenty-three of August, 1622.\r\n\r\nLike most innovations, this attempt met with an indifferent reception,\r\nand was greeted in the literary world with a shower of invective. Even\r\nBen Jonson joined in the outcry, and ridiculed the newspaper office in\r\nhis “Staple of News,” in which, among other notions, he publishes the\r\nparadox, as it now appears to us, that the information contained in the\r\ngazette “had ceased to be news by being printed.” Butler’s venture seems\r\nto have been anything but a success, and but for the fact that it gave\r\nrise to speculation on the subject of newspapers, and laid the\r\nfoundation of our periodical literature, might, so far at all events as\r\nits promoter was concerned, never have had an existence. But the idea\r\nlost no ground, and newspapers began to make their way, though they did\r\nnot assume anything like regularity, or definite shape and character,\r\nfor nearly half a century. None of these precursors of newspaper history\r\nexceeded in size a single small leaf, and the quantity of news contained\r\nin fifty of them would be exceeded by a single issue of the present day.\r\n\r\nWhat is generally supposed to be, but is not, the first authenticated\r\nadvertisement is the following, the political and literary significance\r\nof which is apparent at a glance. It appears in the _Mercurius\r\nPoliticus_ for January 1652:--\r\n\r\n  IRENODIA GRATULATORIA, an Heroick Poem; being a congratulatory\r\n  panegyrick for my Lord General’s late return, summing up his successes\r\n  in an exquisite manner.\r\n\r\n  To be sold by John Holden, in the New Exchange, London. Printed by\r\n  Tho. Newcourt, 1652.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we have no intention of giving any specimens beyond\r\nthose which are striking and characteristic. In subsequent chapters we\r\nshall carry the history in an unbroken line to modern times, but our\r\nintention is now to select special instances and specimens of\r\nparticular interest, and so we pass on to what may be almost considered\r\na landmark in the history of our civilisation and refinement, the\r\nintroduction of tea. The _Mercurius Politicus_ of September 30, 1658,\r\nsets forth--\r\n\r\n  THAT Excellent, and by all Physicians, approved, _China_ drink, called\r\n  by the Chineans _Tcha_, by other nations _Tay_ alias _Tee_, is sold at\r\n  the Sultaness Head Cophee-House, in Sweeting’s Rents, by the Royal\r\n  Exchange, London.\r\n\r\nThis announcement then marks an era; it shows that “l’impertinente\r\nnouveauté du siècle,” as the French physician, Guy Patin, called it in\r\nhis furious diatribes, has not only made its advent, but is fighting its\r\nway forward. Patin is not without followers even in the present day,\r\nmany people who would be surprised if accused of wanting in sense\r\nbelieving all “slops” to be causes of degeneracy. It must be observed\r\nthat this is not the first acquaintance of our countrymen with the\r\nChinese leaf--the advertisement simply shows the progress it is\r\nmaking--as tea is said to have been occasionally sold in England as\r\nearly as 1635, at the exorbitant price of from £6 to £10 per pound.\r\nThomas Garway, a tobacconist and coffee-house keeper in Exchange Alley,\r\nthe founder of Garraway’s Coffee-house, was the first who sold and\r\nretailed tea, recommending it, as always has been, and always will be\r\nthe case with new articles of diet, as a panacea for all disorders flesh\r\nis heir to. The following shop-bill, being more curious than any\r\nhistorical account we have of the early use of “the cup that cheers but\r\nnot inebriates,” will be found well worth reading:--\r\n\r\n  Tea in England hath been sold in the leaf for £6, and sometimes for\r\n  £10 the pound weight, and in respect of its former scarceness and\r\n  dearness it hath been only used as a regalia in high treatments and\r\n  entertainments, and presents made thereof to princes and grandees till\r\n  the year 1657. The said Garway did purchase a quantity thereof, and\r\n  first sold the said tea in leaf or drink, made according to the\r\n  directions of the most knowing merchants into those Eastern countries.\r\n  On the knowledge of the said Garway’s continued care and industry in\r\n  obtaining the best tea, and making drink thereof very many noblemen,\r\n  physicians, merchants, &c., have ever since sent to him for the said\r\n  leaf, and daily resort to his house to drink the drink thereof. He\r\n  sells tea from 16s. to 50s. a pound.\r\n\r\nThe opposition beverage, coffee--mention is made of the “cophee-house”\r\nin the “Tcha” advertisement--had been known in this country some years\r\nbefore, a Turkey merchant of London, of the name of Edwards, having\r\nbrought the first bag of coffee to London, and his Greek servant, Pasqua\r\nRosee, was the first to open a coffee-house in London. This was in 1652,\r\nthe time of the Protectorate, and one Jacobs, a Jew, had opened a\r\nsimilar establishment in Oxford a year or two earlier. Pasqua Rosee’s\r\ncoffee-house was in St Michael’s Alley, Cornhill. One of his original\r\nhandbills is preserved in the British Museum, and is a curious record of\r\na remarkable social innovation. It is here reprinted:--\r\n\r\n  THE VERTUE OF THE COFFEE DRINK,\r\n  _First made and publicly sold in England by_\r\n  _PASQUA ROSEE_.\r\n\r\n  The grain or berry called coffee, groweth upon little trees only in\r\n  the deserts of Arabia. It is brought from thence and drunk generally\r\n  throughout all the Grand Seignour’s dominions. It is a simple,\r\n  innocent thing, composed into a drink, by being dried in an oven, and\r\n  ground to powder, and boiled up with spring water, and about half a\r\n  pint of it to be drunk fasting an hour before, and not eating an hour\r\n  after, and to be taken as hot as can possibly be endured; the which\r\n  will never fetch the skin of the mouth, or raise any blisters by\r\n  reason of that heat.\r\n\r\n  The Turk’s drink at meals and other times is usually water, and their\r\n  diet consists much of fruit; the acidities whereof are very much\r\n  corrected by this drink.\r\n\r\n  The quality of this drink is cold and dry; and though it be a drier;\r\n  yet it neither heats nor inflames more than hot posset. It so\r\n  incloseth the orifice of the stomach, and fortifies the heat within,\r\n  that it is very good to help digestion; and therefore of great use to\r\n  be taken about three or four o’clock afternoon, as well as in the\r\n  morning. It much quickens the spirits, and makes the heart lightsome;\r\n  it is good against sore eyes, and the better if you hold your head\r\n  over it and take in the steam that way. It suppresseth fumes\r\n  exceedingly, and therefore is good against the head-ache, and will\r\n  very much stop any defluxion of rheums that distil from the head upon\r\n  the stomach, and so prevent and help consumptions and the cough of the\r\n  lungs.\r\n\r\n  It is excellent to prevent and cure the dropsy, gout, and scurvy. It\r\n  is known by experience to be better than any other drying drink for\r\n  people in years, or children that have any running humours upon them,\r\n  as the king’s evil, &c. It is a most excellent remedy against the\r\n  spleen, hypochondriac winds, and the like. It will prevent drowsiness,\r\n  and make one fit for business, if one have occasion to watch, and\r\n  therefore you are not to drink of it after supper, unless you intend\r\n  to be watchful, for it will hinder sleep for three or four hours.\r\n\r\n  It is observed that in Turkey, where this is generally drunk, that\r\n  they are not troubled with the stone, gout, dropsy, or scurvy, and\r\n  that their skins are exceeding clear and white. It is neither laxative\r\n  nor restringent.\r\n\r\n  _Made and Sold in St Michael’s Alley, in Cornhill, by Pasqua Rosee,\r\n  at the sign of his own head._\r\n\r\nIn addition to tea and coffee, the introduction and acceptance of which\r\nhad certainly a most marked influence on the progress of civilisation,\r\nmay be mentioned a third, which, though extensively used, never became\r\nquite so great a favourite as the others. Chocolate, the remaining\r\nmember of the triad, was introduced into England much about the same\r\nperiod. It had been known in Germany as early as 1624, when Johan Frantz\r\nRauch wrote a treatise against that beverage. In England, however, it\r\nseems to have been introduced much later, for in 1657 it was still\r\nadvertised as a new drink. In the _Publick Advertiser_ of Tuesday, June\r\n16-22, 1657, we find the following:--\r\n\r\n  IN Bishopsgate Street, in Queen’s Head Alley, at a Frenchman’s house,\r\n  is an excellent West India drink, called chocolate, to be sold, where\r\n  you may have it ready at any time, and also unmade, at reasonable\r\n  rates.\r\n\r\nChocolate never, except among exquisites and women of fashion, made\r\nanything of a race with its more sturdy opponents, in this country at\r\nall events, for while tea and coffee have become naturalised beverages,\r\nchocolate has always retained its foreign prejudices.\r\n\r\nIn the _Kingdom’s Intelligencer_, a weekly paper published in 1662, are\r\ninserted several curious advertisements giving the prices of tea,\r\ncoffee, chocolate, &c., one of which is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  AT the Coffeehouse in Exchange Alley, is sold by retail the right\r\n  _coffee powder_, from 4s. to 6s. 8d. per pound, as in goodness; that\r\n  pounded in a mortar at 2s. 6d. per pound, and that termed the East\r\n  India berry at 18d. per pound. Also that termed the right Turkey\r\n  berry, well garbled at 3s. per pound, the ungarbled for lesse, with\r\n  directions gratis how to make and use the same. Likewise there you may\r\n  have _chocolatta_, the ordinary pound boxes at 2s. 6d. per pound; the\r\n  perfumed from 4s. to 10s. per pound. Also _sherbets_, made in Turkie,\r\n  of lemons, roses, and violets perfumed, and _Tea_ according to its\r\n  goodness. For all which, if any gentleman shall write or send, they\r\n  shall be sure of the best, as they shall order, and, to avoid deceit,\r\n  warranted under the house-seal--viz., Morat the Great. Further, all\r\n  gentlemen that are customers and acquaintance, are (the next New\r\n  Year’s day), invited at the sign of the Great Turk, at the new coffee\r\n  house, in Exchange Alley, where coffee will be on free cost.\r\n\r\nLeaving the enticing subject of these new beverages, we find that in May\r\n1657 there appeared a weekly paper which assumed the title of the\r\n_Public Advertiser_, the first number being dated 19th to 26th May. It\r\nwas printed for Newcombe, in Thames Street, and consisted almost wholly\r\nof advertisements, including the arrivals and departures of ships, and\r\nbooks to be printed. Soon other papers also commenced to insert more and\r\nmore advertisements, sometimes stuck in the middle of political items,\r\nand announcements of marine disasters, murders, marriages, births, and\r\ndeaths. Most of the notices at this period related to runaway\r\napprentices and black boys, fairs and cockfights, burglaries and highway\r\nrobberies, stolen horses, lost dogs, swords, and scent-bottles, and the\r\ndeparture of coaches on long journeys into the provinces, and sometimes\r\neven as far as Edinburgh. These announcements are not devoid of interest\r\nand curiosity for us who live in the days of railways and fast steamers;\r\nand so we quote the following from the _Mercurius Politicus_ of April\r\n1, 1658:--\r\n\r\n  FROM the 26th day of April 1658, there will continue to go Stage\r\n  Coaches from the _George_ Inn, without Aldersgate, _London_, unto the\r\n  several Cities and Towns, for the Rates and at the times hereafter\r\n  mentioned and declared.\r\n\r\n  _Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday._\r\n\r\n  To _Salisbury_ in two days for xxs. To _Blandford_ and _Dorchester_ in\r\n  two days and half for xxxs. To _Burport_ in three days for xxxs. To\r\n  _Exmaster_, _Hunnington_, and _Exeter_ in four days for xls.\r\n\r\n  To _Stamford_ in two days for xxs. To _Newark_ in two days and a half\r\n  for xxvs. To _Bawtry_ in three days for xxxs. To _Doncaster_ and\r\n  _Ferribridge_ for xxxvs. To _York_ in four days for xls.\r\n\r\n  _Mondays_ and _Wednesdays_ to _Ockinton_ and _Plimouth_ for ls.\r\n\r\n  Every _Monday_ to _Helperby_ and _Northallerton_ for xlvs. To\r\n  _Darneton_ and _Ferryhil_ for ls. To _Durham_ for lvs. To _Newcastle_\r\n  for iii£.\r\n\r\n  Once every fortnight to _Edinburgh_ for iv£ a peece--_Mondays_.\r\n\r\n  Every _Friday_, to _Wakefield_ in four days, xls.\r\n\r\n  All persons who desire to travel unto the Cities, Towns, and Roads\r\n  herein hereafter mentioned and expressed, namely--to _Coventry_,\r\n  _Litchfield_, _Stone_, _Namptwich_, _Chester_, _Warrington_, _Wiggan_,\r\n  _Chorley_, _Preston_, _Gastang_, _Lancaster_ and _Kendal_; and also to\r\n  _Stamford_, _Grantham_, _Newark_, _Tuxford_, _Bawtrey_, _Doncaster_,\r\n  _Ferriebridge_, _York_, _Helperby_, _Northallerton_, _Darneton_,\r\n  _Ferryhill_, _Durham_, and _Newcastle_, _Wakefield_, _Leeds_, and\r\n  _Halifax_; and also to _Salisbury_, _Blandford_, _Dorchester_,\r\n  _Burput_, _Exmaster_, _Hunnington_, and _Exeter_, _Ockinton_,\r\n  _Plimouth_, and _Cornwal_; let them repair to the _George_ Inn, at\r\n  _Holborn Bridge, London_, and thence they shall be in good Coaches\r\n  with good Horses, upon every _Monday_, _Wednesday_, and _Fridays_, at\r\n  and for reasonable Rates.\r\n\r\nAmong the advertisements which prevailed most extensively in those early\r\ntimes, may, as has been remarked, be ranked those of runaway servants,\r\napprentices, and black boys. England at that time swarmed with negro or\r\nmulatto boys, which the wealthy used as pages, in imitation of the\r\nItalian nobility. They were either imported from the West Indies, or\r\nbrought from the Peninsula. The first advertisement of a runaway black\r\npage we meet with is dated August 11, 1659, but in this instance the\r\narticle is advertised as “lost,” like a dog, which is after all but\r\nnatural, the boy being a chattel:--\r\n\r\n  A Negro-boy, about nine years of age, in a gray Searge suit, his hair\r\n  cut close to his head, was lost on Tuesday last, _August 9_, at night,\r\n  in St Nicholas Lane, London. If any one can give notice of him to Mr\r\n  Tho. Barker, at the Sugar Loaf, in that Lane, they shall be well\r\n  rewarded for their pains.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to see, from this advertisement, that the wool of the\r\nnegro found no grace in the eye of his Puritan master, who cropped the\r\nboy’s head as close as his own. Black boys continued in fashion for more\r\nthan a century after, and were frequently offered for sale, by means of\r\nadvertisements, in the same manner as slaves used to be, within recent\r\nyears, in the Southern States of America. Even as late as 1769 sales of\r\nhuman flesh went on in this country. The _Gazetteer_, April 18, of that\r\nyear, classes together “for sale at the Bull and Gate, Holborn: a\r\nchestnut gelding, a trim-whiskey, and a well-made, good-tempered black\r\nboy;” whilst a Liverpool paper of ten years later, October 15, 1779,\r\nannounces as to be sold by auction, “at George Dunbar’s offices, on\r\nThursday next, 21st inst., at one o’clock, a black boy about fourteen\r\nyears old, and a large mountain tiger-cat.” This will be news to many\r\nblind worshippers of the ideal creature known as “a man and a brother.”\r\n\r\nAnother curiosity of the advertisement literature of the seventeenth\r\ncentury is the number of servants and apprentices absconding with their\r\nmasters’ property. Nearly all those dishonest servants must have had\r\nappearances such as in these days might lead to conviction first and\r\ntrial afterwards. First of all, there is scarcely one of them but is\r\n“pock-marked,” “pock-pitted,” “pock-fretted,” “pock-holed,”\r\n“pit-marked,” or “full of pock-holes,” a fact which furnishes a\r\nsignificant index of the ravages this terrible sickness must have made\r\namongst our ancestors, and offers a conclusive argument--though argument\r\nis unfortunately inadmissible among them--to those blatant and\r\nillogical people, the opponents of vaccination. Besides the myriads who\r\nannually died of small-pox, it would, perhaps, not be an exaggeration to\r\nassume that one-fourth of mankind at that time was pock-marked, and not\r\npock-marked as we understand the term. Whole features were destroyed,\r\nand a great percentage of blindness was attributable to this cause.\r\nIndeed, so accustomed were the people of those times to pock-marked\r\nfaces, that these familiar inequalities of the facial surface do not\r\nappear to have been considered an absolute drawback even upon the charms\r\nof a beauty or a beau. Louis XIV. in his younger days was considered one\r\nof the handsomest men of France, notwithstanding that he was\r\npock-marked, and La Vallière and some other famous beauties of that\r\nperiod are known to have laboured under the same disadvantage. This is a\r\nhard fact which should destroy many of the ideas raised by fiction. The\r\nfollowing is a fair specimen of the descriptions of the dangerous\r\nclasses given in the early part of the latter half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and is taken from the _Mercurius Politicus_ of May 1658:--\r\n\r\n  A Black-haired Maid, of a middle stature, thick set, with big breasts,\r\n  having her face full marked with the small-pox, calling herself by the\r\n  name of _Nan_ or _Agnes Hobson_, did, upon Monday, the 28 of May,\r\n  about six o’Clock in the morning, steal away from her Ladies house in\r\n  the Pal-Mall, a mingle-coloured wrought Tabby gown of Deer colour and\r\n  white; a black striped Sattin Gown with four broad bone-black silk\r\n  Laces, and a plain black watered French Tabby Gown; Also one\r\n  Scarlet-coloured and one other Pink-coloured Sarcenet Peticoat, and a\r\n  white watered Tabby Wastcoat, plain; Several Sarcenet, Mode, and thin\r\n  black Hoods and Scarfs, several fine Holland Shirts, a laced pair of\r\n  Cuffs and Dressing, one pair of Pink-coloured Worsted Stockings, a\r\n  Silver Spoon, a Leather bag, &c. She went away in greyish Cloth\r\n  Wastcoat turned, and a Pink-coloured Paragon upper Peticoat, with a\r\n  green Tammy under one. If any shall give notice of this person or\r\n  things at one _Hopkins_, a Shoomaker’s, next door to the Vine Tavern,\r\n  near the Pal-mall end, near Charing Cross, or at Mr _Ostler’s_, at the\r\n  Bull Head in Cornhill, near the Old Exchange, they shall be rewarded\r\n  for their pains.\r\n\r\nIn the same style was almost every other description; and though\r\nembarrassed by the quantity as well as quality we have to choose from,\r\nwe cannot pass over this bit of word-painting, which is rich in\r\ndescription. It is from the _Mercurius Politicus_ of July 1658:--\r\n\r\n  ONE Eleanor Parker (by birth _Haddock_), of a Tawny reddish\r\n  complexion, a pretty long nose, tall of stature, servant to _Mr\r\n  Ferderic Howpert_, Kentish Town, upon Saturday last, the _26th of\r\n  June_, ran away and stole two Silver Spoons; a sweet Tent-work Bag,\r\n  with gold and silver Lace about it, and lined with Satin; a Bugle\r\n  work-Cushion, very curiously wrought in all manners of slips and\r\n  flowers; a Shell cup, with a Lyon’s face, and a Ring of silver in its\r\n  mouth; besides many other things of considerable value, which she took\r\n  out of her Mistresses Cabinet, which she broke open; as also some\r\n  Cloaths and Linen of all sorts, to the value of Ten pounds and\r\n  upwards. If any one do meet with her and please to secure her, and\r\n  give notice to the said _Ferderic Howpert_, or else to Mr _Malpass_,\r\n  Leather seller, at the Green Dragon, at the upper end of Lawrence\r\n  Lane, he shall be thankfully rewarded for his pains.\r\n\r\nBut besides the ravages of small-pox, the hue and cry raised after\r\nfelons exhibits an endless catalogue of deformities. Hardly a rogue is\r\ndescribed but he is “ugly as sin.” In turning over these musty piles of\r\nsmall quarto newspapers which were read by the men of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, a most ill-favoured crowd of evil-doers springs up around us.\r\nThe rogues cannot avoid detection, if they venture out among good\r\ncitizens, for they are branded with marks by which all men may know\r\nthem. Take the following specimens of “men of the time.” The first is\r\nfrom the _London Gazette_ of January 24-28, 1677:--\r\n\r\n  ONE John Jones, a Welchman, servant to Mr Gray, of Whitehall, went\r\n  away the 27th with £50 of his master’s in silver. He is aged about 25\r\n  years, of a middle stature, something thick, a down black look,\r\n  purblind, between long and round favoured, something pale of\r\n  complexion, lank, dark, red hair; a hair-coloured large suit on,\r\n  something light; a bowe nose a little sharp and reddish, almost beetle\r\n  brow’d and something deaf, given to slabber in his speech. Whoever\r\n  secures the said servant and brings him to his master, shall have £5\r\n  reward.\r\n\r\nThis portrait was evidently drawn by an admirer; and it is with evident\r\npleasure that the artist, after describing the “lank, dark, red hair,”\r\nand the suit like it, returns to the charge, and gives the finishing\r\ntouches to the comely features. Here is another pair of beauties, whose\r\ndescriptions appear in the _Currant Intelligence_, March 6-9, 1682:--\r\n\r\n  SAMUEL SMITH, Scrivener in Grace Church Street, London, about 26 years\r\n  old, crook-backed, of short stature, red hair, hath a black periwig\r\n  and sometimes a light one, pale complexion, Pock-holed full face, a\r\n  mountier cap with a scarlet Ribbon, and one of the same colour on his\r\n  cravat and sword, a light coloured campaign coat faced with blue shag,\r\n  in company with his brother John Smith, who has a slit in his nose, a\r\n  tall lusty man, red hair, a sad grey campaign coat, a lead colour suit\r\n  lined with red: they were mounted, one on a flea-bitten grey, the\r\n  other on a light bay horse.\r\n\r\nFor powers of description this next is worthy of study. It is\r\ncontemporary with the other:--\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM WALTON, a tall young man about sixteen years of age,\r\n  down-look’d, much disfigured with the Small-pox, strait brown hair,\r\n  black rotten teeth, having an impediment in his speech, in a sad\r\n  coloured cloth sute, the coat faced with shag, a white hat with a\r\n  black ribbon on it, went away from his master, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nAnd so on, as per example; the runaways and missing folk--for all that\r\nare advertised are not offenders against the law--seem to have exhausted\r\nthe whole catalogue of human and inhuman ugliness. By turns the\r\nattention of the public is directed to a brown fellow with a long nose,\r\nor with full staring grey eyes, countenance very ill-favoured, having\r\nlost his right eye, voice loud and shrill, teeth black and rotten, with\r\na wide mouth and a hang-dog look, smutty complexion, a dimple in the top\r\nof his nose, or a flat wry nose with a star in it, voice low and\r\ndisturbed, long visage, down look, and almost every other objectionable\r\npeculiarity imaginable. What a milk-and-water being our modern rough is,\r\nafter all!\r\n\r\nDr Johnson, in a bantering paper on the art of advertising, published in\r\nthe _Idler_, No. 40, observes: “The man who first took advantage of the\r\ngeneral curiosity that was excited by a siege or battle to betray the\r\nreaders of news into the knowledge of the shop where the best puffs and\r\npowder were to be sold, was undoubtedly a man of great sagacity, and\r\nprofound skill in the nature of man. But when he had once shown the way,\r\nit was easy to follow him.” Yet it took a considerable time before the\r\nmass of traders could be brought to understand the real use of\r\nadvertising, even as the great Doctor understood it. Even he could\r\nhardly have comprehended advertising as it is now. The first man who\r\nendeavoured to systematically convince the world of the vast uses which\r\nmight be made of this medium was Sir Roger L’Estrange. That intelligent\r\nspeculator, in 1663, obtained an appointment to the new office of\r\n“Surveyor of the Imprimery and Printing Presses,” by which was granted\r\nto him the sole privilege of writing, printing, and publishing all\r\nnarratives, advertisements, mercuries, &c. &c., besides all briefs for\r\ncollections, playbills, quack-salvers’ bills, tickets, &c. &c. On the\r\n1st of August 1663 appeared a paper published by him, under the name of\r\nthe _Intelligencer_, and on the 24th of the same month the public were\r\nwarned against the “petty cozenage” of some of the booksellers, who had\r\npersuaded their customers that they could not sell the paper under\r\ntwopence a sheet, though it was sold to them at about a fourth part of\r\nthat price. The first number of the _Newes_ (which was also promoted by\r\nSir Roger L’Estrange) appeared September 3, 1663, and, as we are told by\r\nNicholls in his “Literary Anecdotes,” “contained more advertisements of\r\nimportance than any previous paper.” Still, the benefit of the publicity\r\nwhich might be derived from advertising was so little understood by the\r\ntrading community of the period, that after the Plague and the Great\r\nFire this really valuable means of acquainting the public with new\r\nplaces of abode, the resumption of business, and the thousand and one\r\nchanges incidental on such calamities, were almost entirely neglected.\r\nThough nearly the entire city had been burnt out, and the citizens must\r\nnecessarily have entered new premises or erected extempore shops, yet\r\nhardly any announcements appear in the papers to acquaint the public of\r\nthe new addresses. The _London Gazette_, October 11-15, 1666, offered\r\nits services, but hardly to any effect; little regard being paid to the\r\nfollowing invitation:--\r\n\r\n  Such as have settled in new habitations since the late fire, and\r\n  desire for the convenience of their correspondence to publish the\r\n  place of their present abode, or to give notice of goods lost or\r\n  found, may repair to the corner house in Bloomsbury, or on the east\r\n  side of the great square [Bloomsbury Square] before the house of the\r\n  Right Honourable the Lord Treasurer, where there is care taken for the\r\n  receipt and publication of such advertisements.\r\n\r\nAmong the very few advertisements relating to those great calamities is\r\nthe following, produced by the Plague, which is inserted in the\r\n_Intelligencer_, June 22-30, 1665:--\r\n\r\n  THIS is to certify that the master of the Cock and Bottle, commonly\r\n  called the Cock alehouse, at Temple bar, hath dismissed his servants,\r\n  and shut up his house for this long vacation, intending (God willing)\r\n  to return at Michaelmas next, so that all persons who have any\r\n  accounts or farthings belonging to the said house, are desired to\r\n  repair thither before the 8th of this instant, July, and they shall\r\n  receive satisfaction.\r\n\r\nRelating to the Fire, the following from the _London Gazette_, March 12,\r\n1672-73, was the notification:--\r\n\r\n  THESE are to give notice that Edward Barlet, Oxford carrier, hath\r\n  removed his Inn in London from the Swan at Holborn Bridge to the\r\n  Oxford Arms in Warwick Lane, where he did inne before the Fire. His\r\n  coaches and waggons going forth on their usual days, Mondays,\r\n  Wednesdays, and Fridays. He hath also a hearse, with all things\r\n  convenient to carry a corpse to any part of England.\r\n\r\nThere is not, however, a single advertisement relating to any of those\r\ntemporary conveniences of every kind which invariably arise, as by\r\nmagic, on any great and unusual emergency. Indeed, about this period,\r\nand for a long time after, the _London Gazette_, which was the official\r\norgan of the day, appeared frequently without a single advertisement;\r\nand till the end of the reign of Charles II., it was only very rarely\r\nthat that paper contained more than four advertisements of a general\r\nkind, very frequently the number being less. The subjects of these were\r\nalmost exclusively thefts, losses, and runaways. Booksellers’ and\r\nquacks’ advertisements were, however, even then frequent in this paper;\r\ntheir announcements always preceded the others, and were printed in a\r\ndifferent type.\r\n\r\nIn 1668 Mr (afterwards Sir) Roger L’Estrange commenced the _Mercury, or\r\nAdvertisements concerning Trade_, which does not seem to have answered,\r\nfor it soon became extinct. Some years after, the now well-known scheme\r\nof issuing sheets of advertisements gratuitously, trusting for profit to\r\nthe number of advertisers, was for the first time attempted. The paper\r\nstarted on this principle was called the _City Mercury_, and appears to\r\nhave had a hard struggle for existence, since the publishers thought it\r\nnecessary to insert in No. 52 (March 30, 1673) a notice of this tenor:--\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding this paper has been published so long, there are many\r\n  persons ignorant of the design and advantage of it. And it every week\r\n  comes to the hand of some, both in City and Country, that never see it\r\n  before: For which reason the Publisher thinks himself obliged (that\r\n  all may have benefit by it), to inform them that:--\r\n\r\n  1. He gives away every _Monday_ above a thousand of them to all the\r\n  _Booksellers_, _shops_ and _inns_, and most of the principal\r\n  _coffee-houses_ in _London_ and _Westminster_. Besides they are now\r\n  sent to most of the cities and principal towns in England.\r\n\r\n  2. Any person that has anything to insert in it, as the _titles_ of\r\n  _books_, _houses_ or _land_ to be _lett_ or _sold_, _persons removing\r\n  from one place to another_, things _lost_ or _stole_, _physitians’\r\n  advertisements_, or _inquiries_ for _houses_ or _lands_ to be _lett_\r\n  or _sold_, for _places_ or for _servants_, &c., may bring or send them\r\n  to the Publisher, _Tho. Howkins_, in _George Yard_, in Lombard Street,\r\n  London, who will carefully insert them at reasonable rates.\r\n\r\n  3. That this way of publishing is much more advantageous than giving\r\n  away _Bills_ in the street, is certain, for where there is one of them\r\n  read, there’s twenty is not; and a thousand of these cannot be\r\n  supposed to be read by less than twenty times the number of persons;\r\n  and done for at least the twentieth part of the charge, and with much\r\n  less trouble and greater success; as has been experienced by many\r\n  persons that have things inserted in it.\r\n\r\nThis paper lived but a short time; though the fact that the proprietor\r\nundertook to furnish above a thousand copies per week to booksellers,\r\nshops, inns, and coffee-houses in London, and that it was sent to “most\r\nof the cities and principal towns in England,” clearly indicates that\r\nthe trade began to be aware of the advantages to be derived from\r\npublicity. Soon afterwards a paper of the same denomination, but\r\npublished by another speculator, was commenced. Its appearance and\r\npurposes were told to the public in the autumn of 1675 by circulars or\r\nhandbills, one of which has fortunately been stored up in the British\r\nMuseum. As this curious document gives a comprehensive outline of the\r\nsystem of newspaper advertising, as it appeared to the most advanced\r\nthinkers in the reign of Charles II., we reprint it here _in extenso_:--\r\n\r\n  ADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n  _WHEREAS divers people are at great expense in printing, publishing,\r\n  and dispersing of Bills of Advertisements: Observing how practical and\r\n  Advantagious to Trade and Business, &c. this Method is in parts beyond\r\n  the Seas._\r\n\r\n  _These are to give notice, That all Persons in such cases concerned\r\n  henceforth may have published in Print in the_ Mercury _or_ Bills of\r\n  Advertisements, _which shall come out every week on_ Thursday\r\n  _morning, and be delivered and dispersed in every house where the\r\n  Bills of Mortallity are received, and elsewhere, the Publications and\r\n  Advertisements of all the matters following, or any other matter or\r\n  thing not herein mentioned, that shall relate to the Advancement of\r\n  Trade, or any lawful business not granted in propriety to any other._\r\n\r\n  Notice of all Goods, Merchandizes, and Ships to be sold, the place\r\n  where to be seen, and day and hour.\r\n\r\n  Any ships to be let to Freight, and the time of their departure, the\r\n  place of the Master’s habitation, and where to be spoken with before\r\n  and after Exchange time.\r\n\r\n  All Ships, their Names, and Burthens, and capacities, and where their\r\n  Inventaries are to be seen.\r\n\r\n  All other Parcels and Materials or Furniture for shipping in like\r\n  manner.\r\n\r\n  Any Houses to be Let or Sold, or Mortgaged, with Notes of their\r\n  Contents.\r\n\r\n  Any Lands or Houses in City or Country, to be Sold or Mortgaged.\r\n\r\n  The Erection, Alteration, or Removal of any Stage-coach, or any common\r\n  Carrier.\r\n\r\n  Advertisements of any considerable Bargains that are offered.\r\n\r\n  Any curious Invention or Experiment that is to be exposed to the\r\n  Public view or Sale, may be hereby notified when and where.\r\n\r\n  Hereby Commissioners upon Commissions against Bankrupts may give large\r\n  notice.\r\n\r\n  In like manner any man may give notice as he pleaseth to his\r\n  Creditors.\r\n\r\n  Hereby the Settlement or Removal of any Publick Office may be\r\n  notified.\r\n\r\n  Hereby all School-masters, and School-mistresses, and\r\n  Boarding-schools, and Riding-schools or Academies, may publish the\r\n  place where their Schools are kept.\r\n\r\n  And in like manner, where any Bathes or Hot-houses are kept.\r\n\r\n  And the Place or Key at the Waterside, whereto any Hoy or Vessel doth\r\n  constantly come to bring or carry Goods; as those of _Lee_,\r\n  _Faversham_, and _Maidstone_, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _AT the Office, which is to be kept for the Advertisements, any Person\r\n  shall be informed (without any Fee) where any Stage-coach stands,\r\n  where any common Carrier lies, that comes to any Inn within the Bills\r\n  of Mortallity, and their daies of coming in and going out._\r\n\r\n  _In like manner all the accustomed Hoys or Vessels that come to the\r\n  several Keys from the several Ports of_ England.\r\n\r\n  _All Masters and Owners of the several Stage-coaches, and the\r\n  Master-Carriers, and the Masters of all the Hoys and Vessels above\r\n  mentioned, are desired to repair between this and_ Christmas _day\r\n  next, to the Office kept for the receipt of the Advertisements, to see\r\n  if no mistakes be in their several daies and rates, that the said\r\n  Books may be declared perfect, which shall be no charge to the Persons\r\n  concerned._\r\n\r\n  _The Office or Place where any Person may have his desires answered in\r\n  anything hereby advertised, is kept in St Michael’s Alley in Cornhil,\r\n  London, right against Williams Coffee-house, where constant attendance\r\n  every day in the Week shall be given, from Nine in the Morning, to\r\n  Five in the Evening; to receive the desires of all Persons in matters\r\n  of this nature, carefully to answer them in the same._\r\n\r\n  ^With Allowance.^\r\n\r\n  _LONDON:_\r\n\r\n  Printed by _Andrew Clark_, in _Aldersgate Street_, 1675.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this prospectus, the first number of the _City\r\nMercury_ appeared November 4, 1675.\r\n\r\nWe, who are familiar with the thousand and one tricks resorted to by\r\ntraders in order to attract attention to their advertisements, may be\r\napt to ridicule the artless manner in which these notices were brought\r\nbefore the public of the seventeenth century. Different types, dividing\r\nlines, woodcuts, and other contrivances to catch the wandering eye, were\r\nstill unknown; and frequently all the advertisements were set forth in\r\none string, without a single break, or even full stop, as in the\r\nsubjoined specimen from the _Loyal Impartial Mercury_, November 14-17,\r\n1681:--\r\n\r\n  ☞ THE House in the Strand wherein the Morocco Embassador lately\r\n  resided is to be let, furnished or unfurnished, intirely or in several\r\n  parts; a house in Marklane fit for a marchant; also very good lodgings\r\n  not far from the Royal Exchange, fit for any marchant or gentleman to\r\n  be let, inquire at the North West corner of the Royal Exchange, and\r\n  there you may know further; inquiry is made at the said office for\r\n  places to be Stewards of courts, liberties or franchises, or any\r\n  office at law, or places to be auditor, or receiver, or steward of the\r\n  household, or gentleman of horse to any nobleman or gentleman; or\r\n  places to be clarks to brew-houses, or wharfs, or suchlike; also any\r\n  person that is willing to buy or sell any estates, annuities, or\r\n  mortgages, or let, or take any house, or borrow money upon the bottom\r\n  of ships, may be accommodated at the said office.\r\n\r\nConciseness was of course necessary when it is recollected that the\r\npaper was only a folio half-sheet, though the news was so scanty that\r\nthe few advertisements were a boon to the reader, and were sure to be\r\nread. This was an advantage peculiar to the early advertisers. So long\r\nas the papers were small, and the advertisements few in number, the\r\ntrade announcements were almost more interesting than the news. But when\r\nthe papers increased in bulk, and advertisements became common, it\r\nbehoved those who wished to attract special attention to resort to\r\ncontrivances which would distinguish them from the surrounding crowd of\r\ncompetitors.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _London Mercury_, in 1681, evidently with an eye to\r\nmaking his paper a property on the best of all principles, requests all\r\nthose who have houses for sale to advertise in his columns, “where,”\r\nsays he, “farther care will be taken for their disposal than the bare\r\npublishing them, by persons who make it their business.” Consequently we\r\nfrequently meet in this paper with notices of “A delicate House to\r\nlett,” agreeably varied with advertisements concerning spruce beer,\r\nscurvy grass, Daffy’s elixir, and other specifics. Notwithstanding that\r\nthe utility of advertising as a means of obtaining publicity was as yet\r\nhardly understood, the form of an advertisement, according to modern\r\nplans, was, it is curious to observe, frequently adopted at this period\r\nto expose sentiments in a veiled manner, or to call attention to public\r\ngrievances. Thus, for instance, the first numbers of the _Heraclitus\r\nRidens_, published in 1681, during the effervescence of the Popish\r\nplots, contained almost daily one or more of these political satires, of\r\nwhich the following may serve as examples. The first appears February 4.\r\n\r\n  IF any person out of natural curiosity desire to be furnished with\r\n  ships or castles in the air, or any sorts of prodigies, apparitions,\r\n  or strange sights, the better to fright people out of their senses,\r\n  and by persuading them there are strange judgments, changes, and\r\n  revolutions hanging over their heads, thereby to persuade them to pull\r\n  them down by discontents, fears, jealousies, and seditions; let them\r\n  repair to Ben Harris, at his shop near the Royal Exchange, where they\r\n  may be furnished with all sorts and sizes of them, at very cheap and\r\n  easy rates.\r\n\r\n  There is also to be seen the strange egg with the comet in it which\r\n  was laid at Rome, but sent from his Holiness to the said Ben, to make\r\n  reparations for his damages sustained, and as a mark of esteem for his\r\n  zeal and sufferings in promoting discord among the English hereticks,\r\n  and sowing the seeds of sedition among the citizens of London.\r\n\r\nThe edition of February 15 contains the following:--\r\n\r\n  IF any protestant dissenter desire this spring time to be furnished\r\n  with sedition seeds, or the true protestant rue, which they call “herb\r\n  of grace,” or any other hopeful plants of rebellion, let them repair\r\n  to the famous French gardeners Monsieur F. Smith, Msr. L. Curtis, and\r\n  Msr. B. Harris; where they may have not only of all the kinds which\r\n  grew in the garden of the late keepers of the liberty of England; but\r\n  much new variety raised by the art and industry of the said gardeners,\r\n  with directions in print when to sow them, and how to cultivate them\r\n  when they are raised.\r\n\r\n  You may also have there either green or pickled sallads of rumours and\r\n  reports, far more grateful to the palate, or over a glass of wine,\r\n  than your French Champignons or mushrooms, Popish Olives, or Eastland\r\n  Gherkins.\r\n\r\nAnd on March 1 there was given to the world:--\r\n\r\n  A MOST ingenious monkey, who can both write, read, and speak as good\r\n  sense as his master, nursed in the kitchen of the late Commonwealth,\r\n  and when they broke up housekeeping entertained by Nol Protector, may\r\n  be seen do all his old tricks over again, for pence apiece, every\r\n  Wednesday, at his new master’s, Ben. Harris, in Cornhill.\r\n\r\nThis was a species of wit similar to that associated with the imaginary\r\nsigns adopted in books with secret imprints, in order to express certain\r\npolitical notions, the sentiments of which were embodied in the work;\r\nfor instance, a pamphlet just before the outbreak of the Civil War is\r\ncalled, “Vox Borealis, or a Northerne Discoverie, etc. Printed by\r\nMargery Marprelate, amidst the Babylonians, in Thwack Coat Lane, at the\r\nsign of the Crab Tree Cudgell, without any privilege of the Catercaps.”\r\n\r\nOne John Houghton, F.R.S., who combined the business of apothecary with\r\nthat of dealer in tea, coffee, and chocolate, in Bartholomew Lane,\r\ncommenced a paper in 1682, entitled _A Collection for the Improvement of\r\nHusbandry and Trade_,[25] which continued to be issued weekly for some\r\ntime; and though it failed, it was revived again on March 30, 1692. It\r\nwas modelled on the same plan as the _City Mercury_ of 1675, and was\r\nrather ambitious in its views. It consisted of one folio half-sheet, and\r\nwas intended to “lay out for a large correspondence, and for the\r\nadvantage of tenant, landlord, corn merchant, mealman, baker, brewer,\r\nfeeder of cattle, farmer, maltster, buyer and seller of coals, hop\r\nmerchant, soap merchant, tallow chandler, wood merchant, their\r\ncustomers,” &c. But no advertisements proper were mentioned at first; it\r\nwas a mere bulletin or price-current of the above-named trades and of\r\nauctions, besides shipping news and the bills of mortality. The first\r\nadvertisement appeared in the third number, it was a “book-ad,” and\r\nfigured there all by itself; and it was not till the 8th of June that\r\nthe second advertisement appeared, which assumed the following shape:--\r\n\r\n  ☞ FOR the further and better Improvement of Husbandry and Trade and\r\n  for the Encouragement thereof, especially in Middlesex and the\r\n  bordering counties, a Person, now at my house in Bartholomew Lane,\r\n  does undertake to make or procure made, as good malt of the barley of\r\n  these counties, and of that Malt as good Ale as is made at Derby,\r\n  Nottingham, or any other place now famous for that liquor, and that\r\n  upon such reasonable terms as shall be to general satisfaction, the\r\n  extraordinary charge not amounting to above one penny per bushel more\r\n  than that is now; only thus much I must advise, if provision be not\r\n  made speedily, the opportunity will be lost for the next malting time.\r\n\r\nUnder the fostering influence of Houghton, who appears to have been\r\nkeenly aware of the advantage to be derived from this manner of\r\nobtaining publicity, advertisements of every kind began gradually to\r\nappear, and ere long the booksellers, who for some time had monopolised\r\nthis paper, were pushed aside by the other trades; and so the attention\r\nof the public is by turns directed to blacking balls, tapestry hangings,\r\nspectacles, writing ink, coffins, copper and brass work, &c. &c.; and\r\nthese notices increased so rapidly that, added to No. 52, which appeared\r\non July 28, 1693, there is a half-sheet of advertisements, which is\r\nintroduced to the public with the following curious notice:--\r\n\r\n  My Collection I shall carry on as usual. This part is to give away,\r\n  and those who like it not, may omit the reading. I believe it will\r\n  help on Trade, particularly encourage the advertisers to increase the\r\n  vent of my papers. I shall receive all sorts of advertisements, but\r\n  shall answer for the reasonableness of none, unless I give thereof a\r\n  particular character on which (as I shall give it) may be\r\n  _dependance_, but no argument that others deserve not as well. I am\r\n  informed that seven or eight thousand gazettes are each time printed,\r\n  which makes them the most universal Intelligencers; but I’ll suppose\r\n  mine their first handmaid, because it goes (though not so thick yet)\r\n  to _most_ parts: It’s also lasting to be put into Volumes with\r\n  indexes, and particularly there shall be an index of all the\r\n  advertisements, whereby, for ages to come, they may be useful.\r\n\r\nThis first sheet consists solely of advertisements about newly published\r\nbooks, but it concludes:--\r\n\r\n  ☞ Whither ’tis worth while to give an account of ships sent in for\r\n  lading or ships arrived, with the like for coaches and carriers; or to\r\n  give notice of approaching fairs, and what commodities are chiefly\r\n  sold there, I must submit to the judgment of those concerned.\r\n\r\nThe advertisements in Houghton’s _Collection_ may appear strange to the\r\nreader accustomed to rounded sentences and glowing periods, but in the\r\nreign of William III. the general absence of education rendered the\r\nsocial element more unsophisticated in character. In those old days the\r\nadvertiser and editor of the paper frequently speak in the first person\r\nsingular; also the advertiser often speaks through the editor. A few\r\nspecimens taken at random will give the reader a tolerably good idea of\r\nthe style then prevalent:--\r\n\r\n  ----A very eminent brewer, and one I know to be a very honest\r\n  gentleman, wants an apprentice; I can give an account of him.\r\n\r\n  ----I want a house keeper rarely well accomplished for that purpose.\r\n  ’Tis for a suitable gentleman.\r\n\r\n  ----I know of valuable estates to be sold.\r\n\r\n  ----I want several apprentices for a valuable tradesman.\r\n\r\n  ----I can help to ready money for any library great or small or\r\n  parcels of pictures or household goods.\r\n\r\n  ----I want a negro man that is a good house carpenter and a good\r\n  shoemaker.\r\n\r\n  ⁂ I want a young man about 14 or 15 years old that can trim and look\r\n  after a peruke. ’Tis to wait on a merchant.\r\n\r\n  ----I want a pritty boy to wait on a gentleman who will take care of\r\n  him and put him out an apprentice.\r\n\r\n  ----If any gentleman wants a housekeeper, I believe I can help to the\r\n  best in England.\r\n\r\n  ----Many masters want apprentices and many youths want masters. If\r\n  they apply themselves to me, I’ll strive to help them. Also for\r\n  variety of valuable services.\r\n\r\n  By reason of my great corresponding, I may help masters to apprentices\r\n  and Apprentices to Masters. And now is wanting Three Boys, one with\r\n  £70, one with £30, and a Scholar with £60.\r\n\r\n  ----I know of several curious women that would wait on ladies to be\r\n  housekeepers.\r\n\r\n  ----Now I want a good usher’s place in a Grammar school.\r\n\r\n  ----I want a young man that can write and read, mow and roll a garden,\r\n  use a gun at a deer, and understand country sports, and to wait at\r\n  table, and such like.\r\n\r\n  ----If any young man that plays well on the violin and writes a good\r\n  hand desires a clerkship, I can help him to £20 a year.\r\n\r\n  ----I want a complete young man, that will wear livery, to wait on a\r\n  very valuable gentleman, but he must know how to play on a violin or a\r\n  flute.\r\n\r\n  ----I want a genteel footman that can play on the violin to wait on a\r\n  person of honour.\r\n\r\n  ----If I can meet with a sober man that has a counter tenor voice, I\r\n  can help him to a place worth £30 the year or more.\r\n\r\nThis continual demand for musical servants arose from the fashion of\r\nmaking them take part in musical performances, of which custom we find\r\nfrequent traces in Pepys. Altogether the most varied accomplishments\r\nappear to have been expected from servants; as, for instance,--\r\n\r\n  ----If any Justice of the Peace wants a clerk, I can help to one that\r\n  has been so seven years; understands accounts, to be butler, also to\r\n  receive money. He also can shave and buckle wigs.\r\n\r\nThe editor frequently gives special testimony as to the respectability\r\nof the advertiser:--\r\n\r\n  ----If any one wants a wet nurse, I can help them, as I am informed,\r\n  to a very good one.\r\n\r\n  ----I know a gentlewoman whose family is only her husband, herself and\r\n  maid, and would to keep her company take care of a child, two or\r\n  three, of three years old or upwards. She is my good friend, and such\r\n  a one that whoever put their children to her, I am sure will give me\r\n  thanks, and think themselves happy, let them be what rank they will.\r\n\r\n  ----I have been to Mr Firmin’s work house in Little Britain, and seen\r\n  a great many pieces of what seems to me excellent linen, made by the\r\n  poor in and about London. He will sell it at reasonable rates, and I\r\n  believe whatever house keepers go there to buy will not repent, and on\r\n  Wednesdays and Saturdays in the forenoon he is always there himself.\r\n\r\n  ----I have met with a curious gardener that will furnish any body that\r\n  sends to me for fruit trees, and floreal shrubs, and garden seeds. I\r\n  have made him promise with all solemnity that whatever he sends shall\r\n  be purely good, and I verily believe he may be depended on.\r\n\r\n  ----One that has waited on a lady divers years, and understands all\r\n  affairs in housekeeping and the needle, desires some such place. She\r\n  seems a discreet, staid body.\r\n\r\nAt other times Houghton recommends “a tidy footman,” a “quick,\r\nwell-looking fellow,” or “an extraordinary cook-maid;” and observes of a\r\ncertain ladysmaid, who offered her services through his _Collection_,\r\n“and truly she looks and discourses passing well.” Occasionally he also\r\nguarantees the situation; thus, applying for “a suitable man that can\r\nread and write, and will wear a livery,” he adds for the information of\r\nflunkeys in general: “I believe that ’twill be a very good place, for\r\n’tis to serve a fine gentleman whom I well know, and he will give £5 the\r\nyear besides a livery.” Imagine Jeames of Belgravia being told he should\r\nhave £5 for his important annual services! Another time “’tis to wait on\r\na very valuable old batchelor gentleman in the City.” Again, he\r\nrecommends a Protestant French gentleman, who is willing to wait on some\r\nperson of quality, and Houghton adds, “from a valuable divine, my good\r\nfriend, I have a very good character of him.” Of a certain surgeon, whom\r\nhe advertises, he says, “I have known him, I believe, this twenty\r\nyears.” All these recommendations bear an unmistakable character of\r\ntruth and honesty on their face, and are very different from the\r\ncommendatory paragraphs which nowadays appear in the body of a paper\r\nbecause of long advertisements which are to be found in the outer sheet.\r\nNor is the worthy man ever willing to engage his word further than where\r\nhe can speak by experience; in other cases, an “I believe,” or some such\r\ncautious expression, invariably appears. Recommending a hairdresser, he\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n  ----I know a peruke maker that _pretends_ to make perukes\r\n  extraordinary fashionable, and will sell good pennyworths; I can\r\n  direct to him.\r\n\r\nAnd once, when a number of quack advertisements had found their way into\r\nthe paper, old Houghton, with a sly nod and a merry twinkle in his eye,\r\nalmost apparent as one reads, drily puts his “index” above them, with\r\nthe following caution:--\r\n\r\n  ☞ Pray, mind the preface to this half sheet. Like lawyers, I take all\r\n  causes. I may fairly; who likes not may stop here.\r\n\r\nA tolerably broad hint of his disbelief in the said nostrums and\r\nelixirs. Even booksellers had to undergo the test of his ordeal, and\r\nhaving discovered some of their shortcomings, he warned them--\r\n\r\n  ⁂ I desire all booksellers to send me no new titles to old books, for\r\n  they will be rejected.\r\n\r\nWhen a book of the right reverend father in God John Wilkins, late\r\nBishop of Chester, was published, Houghton recommended it in patronising\r\nterms--\r\n\r\n  ----I have read this book, and do think it a piece of great ingenuity,\r\n  becoming the Bishop of Chester, and is useful for a great many\r\n  purposes, both profit and pleasure.\r\n\r\nOf another work he says--\r\n\r\n  ----With delight have I read over this book, and think it a very good\r\n  one.\r\n\r\nThus, notwithstanding the primitive form of the advertisements, the\r\nbenefit to be derived from this mode of publicity began to be more and\r\nmore understood. It was not without great trouble, however; and it was\r\nnecessary that Houghton should constantly direct the attention of the\r\ntrading community to the resources and advantages of advertising, which\r\nhe did in the most candid manner. He simply and abruptly puts the\r\nquestion and leaves those interested to solve it. Thus:--\r\n\r\n  ----Whether advertisements of schools, or houses and lodgings about\r\n  London may be useful, I submit to those concerned.\r\n\r\nAnd the answer came; for a few days after the public were informed that\r\n\r\n  ----At one Mr Packer’s, in Crooked Lane, next the Dolphin, are very\r\n  good Lodgings to be let, where there is freedom from noise, and a\r\n  pretty garden.\r\n\r\nFreedom from noise and a pretty garden in a street leading from\r\nEastcheap to Fish Street Hill! Shortly after Houghton calmly observes:--\r\n\r\n  ----I now find advertisements of schools, houses and lodgings in and\r\n  about London are thought useful.\r\n\r\nHe then starts other subjects:--\r\n\r\n  ----I believe some advertisements about bark and timber might be of\r\n  use both to buyer and seller.\r\n\r\n  ⁂ I find several barbers think it their interest to take in these\r\n  papers, and I believe the rest will when they understand them.\r\n\r\nThe barber’s shop was then the headquarters of gossip, as it took a long\r\ntime to shave the whole of a man’s beard and curl a sufficient quantum\r\nof hair or wig, as worn in those old days, and so the man of suds was\r\nexpected to entertain his customers or find them entertainment. Next\r\nturning his attention to the clergy, Houghton offers that body a helping\r\nhand also:--\r\n\r\n  ⁂ I would gladly serve the clergy in all their wants.\r\n\r\nHow he understood this friendly help soon appeared:--\r\n\r\n  ----If any divine or their relicts have complete sets of manuscript\r\n  sermons upon the Epistles and the Gospels, the Catechism or Festivals,\r\n  I can help them to a customer.\r\n\r\nThe use of second-hand sermons was not unknown in those days, and\r\ndetection was of course much less imminent than now. Then--\r\n\r\n  ----I have sold all the manuscript sermons I had and many more, and if\r\n  any has any more to dispose of that are good and legibly writ, I\r\n  believe I can help them to customers.\r\n\r\nPossibly the “many more” was a heavy attempt at humour; but anyhow the\r\nsermon article was in great demand, and his kindly services did not rest\r\nthere:--\r\n\r\n  ----If any incumbent within 20 miles of London will dispose of his\r\n  living, I can help him to a chapman.\r\n\r\n  ----A rectory of £100 per annum in as good an air as any in England,\r\n  60 miles off, and an easy cure is to be commuted.\r\n\r\n  ----A vicaridge and another cure which requires service but once a\r\n  month, value £86. ’Tis in Kent about 60 miles from London.\r\n\r\nAnd so on, proving that the clergy had not refused the friendly offer,\r\nand were fully as ready as the tradesman to avail themselves of this\r\nmeans of giving vent to their wants and requirements.\r\n\r\nHoughton would occasionally do a little business to oblige a friend,\r\nthough it is fair to assume that he participated in the profits:--\r\n\r\n  ⁂For a friend, I can sell very good flower of brimstone, etc., as\r\n  cheap or cheaper than any in town does; and I’ll sell any good\r\n  commodity for any man of repute if desired.\r\n\r\n  ----I find publishing for others does them kindness, therefore note: I\r\n  sell lozenges for 8d. the ounce which good drinkers commend against\r\n  heartburn, and are excellent for women with child, to prevent\r\n  miscarriages; also the true _lapis nephriticus_ which is esteemed\r\n  excellent for the stone by wearing it on the wrist.\r\n\r\n  ----I would gladly buy for a friend the historical part of Cornelius a\r\n  Lapide upon the Bible.\r\n\r\nBesides the above particular advertisements, the paper frequently\r\ncontained another kind, which to us may appear singularly vague and\r\nunbusinesslike, but which no doubt perfectly answered their purpose\r\namong a comparatively minute metropolitan population, the subjects of\r\nWilliam III. We allude to general advertisements such as these:--\r\n\r\n  Last week was imported\r\n\r\n  Bacon by _Mr Edwards_.\r\n  Cheese by _Mr Francia_.\r\n  Corral Beads by _Mr Paggen_.\r\n  Crabs Eyes by _Mr Harvey_.\r\n  Horse Hair by _Mr Becens_.\r\n  Joynted Babies by _Mr Harrison_.\r\n  Mapps by _Mr Thompson_.\r\n  Orange Flower Water by _Mr Bellamy_.\r\n  Prospective Glasses by _Mr Mason_.\r\n  Saffron by _Mr Western_.\r\n  Sturgeon by _Mr Kett_.\r\n\r\n  If any desire it other things may be inserted.\r\n\r\nIn similar style a most extraordinary variety of other things imported\r\nare advertised in subsequent numbers, including crystal stones, hops,\r\noxguts, incle, juniper, old pictures, onions, pantiles, quick eels,\r\nrushes, spruce beer, sturgeon, trees, brandy, chimney backs, caviar,\r\ntobacco-pipes, whale-fins, bugle, canes, sheep’s-guts, washballs and\r\nsnuff, a globe, aqua fortis, shruffe, quills, waxworks, ostrich\r\nfeathers, scamony, clagiary paste, Scotch coals, sweet soap, onion seed,\r\ngherkins, mum, painted sticks, soap-berries, mask-leather, and so on,\r\nfor a long time, only giving the names of the importers, without ever\r\nmentioning their addresses, until at last a bright idea struck this\r\ngentleman, who seems to have been one of those vulgarly said to be\r\nbefore their time, but who are in fact the pioneers who pave the way for\r\nall improvements; and so the _Collection_ was enriched with the\r\nfollowing notice:--\r\n\r\n  ----If desired I’ll set down the places of abode, and I am sure ’twill\r\n  be of good use: for I am often asked it.\r\n\r\nHoughton was indeed so well aware of the utility of giving the\r\naddresses, that in order to render his paper more permanently useful, he\r\npublished, apparently on his own account, not only the addresses of some\r\nof the principal shops, but also a list of the residences of the leading\r\ndoctors. From this we gather that in June 1694 there were 93 doctors in\r\nand about London, also that Dr (afterwards Sir) Hans Sloane lived at\r\nMontague House (now the British Museum), Dr Radcliffe in Bow Street, and\r\nDr Garth, by Duke Street. At the conclusion of this list the publisher\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  ----I shall also go the round, I. of Counsellors and Attorneys; II. of\r\n  Surgeons and Gardiners; III. of Lawyers and Attorneys; IV. Schools and\r\n  Woodmongers; V. Brokers, coaches and carriers, and such like, and then\r\n  round again, beginning with Physitians.\r\n\r\nThus by untiring perseverance, and no small amount of thought and study,\r\nHoughton trained his contemporaries in the art of advertising, and made\r\nthem acquainted with the valuable assistance to be derived from a medium\r\nwhich, as Alexis de Tocqueville remarks, drops the same thought into a\r\nthousand minds at almost the same period. Apart from the interest which\r\nhis papers have on the subject we have been considering, they are full\r\nof graphic details which throw a clear and effective light on these old\r\nand bygone times. What can give a more vivid picture of the state of the\r\nroads in this country in winter-time, nearly two centuries ago, than the\r\nfollowing notice extracted from the _Collection for Husbandry and\r\nTrade_, March 10, 1693:--\r\n\r\n  ----Roads are filled with snow, we are forced to ride with the paquet\r\n  over hedges and ditches. This day seven-night my boy with the paquet\r\n  and two gentlemen were seven hours riding from Dunstable to Hockley,\r\n  but three miles, hardly escaping with their lives, being often in\r\n  holes and forced to be drawn out with ropes. A man and a woman were\r\n  found dead within a mile hence. I fear I have lost my letter-carrier,\r\n  who has not been heard of since Thursday last. Six horses lie dead on\r\n  the road between Hockley and Brickhill, smothered. I was told last\r\n  night that lately was found dead near Beaumarais three men and three\r\n  horses.\r\n\r\nAt this picture of those good old times for which people who know\r\nnothing about them now weep, we will stop. The rest of the story, so far\r\nas the development of advertisements is concerned, will be told in\r\nstrict chronological order.\r\n\r\n  [24] Broer Jansz styles himself “Couranteer in the Army of his\r\n  Princely Excellence,” _i.e._, Prince Frederic Henry, the Stadtholder.\r\n  Subsequently, in 1630, Jansz commenced a new series, which he entitled\r\n  “Tidings from Various Quarters.”\r\n\r\n  [25] John Nicholl, in his “Literary Anecdotes,” vol. iv. p. 71, calls\r\n  the editor of this paper Benjamin Harris, a well-known publisher of\r\n  pamphlets in the reign of Charles II., and says that J. Knighton was\r\n  the editor in 1692. This last name may be a clerical error for\r\n  Houghton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n_DEVELOPMENT OF ADVERTISING._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at a period when the value of advertising was\r\nbeginning to make itself felt among even the most conservative, and when\r\nit at last began to dawn upon the minds so unaccustomed to change or\r\nimprovement, that a new era in the history of trade was about to\r\ncommence, even if it had not commenced already. So the newspapers of the\r\nlatter half of the seventeenth century begin to offer fresh inducements\r\nto the reader, no matter whether to the antiquarian or simply curious.\r\nAnd he must be a flippant reader indeed who is not impressed by these\r\nfiles of musty and bygone journals, pervaded by the spirit of a former\r\nage, and redolent of the busy doings of men who generations ago were not\r\nonly dead but forgotten. Few things could be more suggestive of the\r\nsteady progress of Time, and the quite as steady progress of his\r\ncongeners, Death and Forgetfulness, than these papers. Novelists and\r\nessayists have described in most eloquent words the feelings which are\r\naroused by the perusal of suddenly-discovered and long-forgotten\r\nletters; and similar feelings, though of a much more extended\r\ndescription, are evoked by a glance through any volume of these\r\nmoth-eaten journals. A writer of a few years back, speaking of the\r\nadvertisements, says, “As we read in the old musty files of newspapers\r\nthose _naïve_ announcements, the very hum of bygone generations seems to\r\nrise to the ear. The chapman exhibits his quaint wares, the mountebank\r\ncapers again upon his stage, we have the living portrait of the\r\nhighwayman flying from justice, we see the old-china auctions thronged\r\nwith ladies of quality with their attendant negro-boys, or those by\r\n‘inch of candle-light,’ forming many a Schalken-like picture of light\r\nand shade; or later still we have Hogarthian sketches of the young\r\nbloods who swelled of old along the Pall-Mall. We trace the moving\r\npanorama of men and manners up to our own less demonstrative, but more\r\nearnest times; and all these cabinet pictures are the very\r\ndaguerreotypes cast by the age which they exhibit, not done for effect,\r\nbut faithful reflections of those insignificant items of life and\r\nthings, too small, it would seem, for the generalising eye of the\r\nhistorian, however necessary to clothe and fill in the dry bones of his\r\nhistory.” Indeed, turning over these musty volumes of newspapers is for\r\nthe imaginative mind a pleasure equal to reading the _Tatler_ or\r\n_Spectator_, or the plays of the period. By their means Cowper’s idea of\r\nseeing life “through the loopholes of retreat” is realised, and\r\ncharacteristic facts and landmarks of progress in the history of\r\ncivilisation are brought under our notice, as the busy life of bygone\r\ngenerations bursts full upon us. We see the merchant at his door, and\r\ninside the dimly-lit shops observe the fine ladies of the time deep in\r\nthe mysteries of brocades and other articles of the feminine toilet,\r\nwhose very names are now lost to even the mercers themselves. And not\r\nalone intent on flowered mantuas and paduasoys are they, for we can in\r\nfancy see them, keen ever to a fancied bargain, pricing Chinese teapots\r\nor Japanese cabinets, and again watch them as, with fluttering hearts,\r\nthey assist at lotteries for valuables of the quality familiar to\r\n“knockouts” of our own time. We hear the lament of the beau who has lost\r\nhis clouded amber-headed cane or his heart at the playhouse, and listen\r\nto the noisy quacks vending their nostrums, each praising his own wares\r\nor depreciating those of his rivals. We see the dishonest serving-man\r\nrush past us on the road carrying the heterogeneous treasures which have\r\ntempted his cupidity. Soon the “Hue and Cry” brings the same\r\nill-favoured malefactor before us in an improved character as\r\nhorse-stealer and highwayman; and ere long we hear of the conclusion of\r\nhis short drama at Tyburn. Thus the various advertisements portray, with\r\nmore or less vividness, lineaments of the times and the characters of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThat the newspapers were early used for the purpose of giving\r\ncontradictions by means of advertisement, or effecting sly puffs, is\r\nshown by the following, which was doubtless intended to call attention\r\nto the work, and which was published in the form of an ordinary\r\nparagraph in the _Modern Intelligence_, April 15-22, 1647:--\r\n\r\n  There came forth a book this day relating how a divil did appear in\r\n  the house or yard of Mr Young, mercer in Lombard St., with a great\r\n  many particulars there related; It is desired by the gentleman of that\r\n  house, and those of his family, that all that are credulous of those\r\n  things (which few wise are), may be assured that its all fabulous, and\r\n  that there was never any such thing. It is true there is a dog, and\r\n  that dog hath a chain, and the gentleman’s son played upon an\r\n  instrument of music for his recreation,--but these are to be seen,\r\n  which a spirit sure never was.\r\n\r\nThere is a logical deduction about the conclusion of this which it is to\r\nbe hoped forced itself upon the minds of those who were ready to believe\r\nnot only in the existence but in the visibility of spirits; and if the\r\nparagraph was but a lift for the book after all, it surely deserved\r\nsuccess, if only for the quaint way in which it admits to the dog and\r\nthe boy and the musical instrument, a combination equal upon an\r\nemergency to the simulation of a very powerful devil. In the very next\r\nedition of the same paper we come upon a paragraph which is even more\r\ndirect in its advertising properties, which, in fact, might have been\r\ndictated by editorial “friendship” in these days, instead of in the\r\nfirst half of the seventeenth century. It runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  You should have had a notable oration made by the Bishop of Angoulesme\r\n  and Grand Almoner to his Majesty of England, at a Convention in Paris\r\n  in favour of the Catholicks in England and Ireland, but being\r\n  overlarge it will be made public the beginning of next week by itself\r\n  it is worth reading especially by those who are for a generall\r\n  toleration when they may clearly see it is the broad way to the\r\n  destruction of these kingdommes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The 23. of May.\r\n\r\n  VVEEKELY\r\n  Nevves from Italy,\r\n  GERMANIE, HVNGARIA,\r\n  BOHEMIA, the PALATINATE,\r\n  France, and the Low Countries.\r\n\r\n  _Translated out of the Low Dutch Copie._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  LONDON,\r\n  Printed by _I.

It runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  BY the late tumult made the 27 of November, whereof you have the\r\n  narration before; in the night time in Bexfield, in the county of\r\n  Norfolk, about 12 Horses were stolen out of the town, whereof a\r\n  bay-bald Gelding with three white feet, on the near buttock marked\r\n  with R. F., 9 or 10 years old. A bay-bald Mare with a wall-eye and a\r\n  red star in her face, the near hind foot white, 7 years old. A black\r\n  brown Mare, trots all, 6 years old. Whomsoever brings certain\r\n  intelligence where they are to Mr Badcraft of Bexfield, in Norfolk,\r\n  they shall have 20s. for each Horse.\r\n\r\nThe following number of the same paper, that for December 5-12, 1650,\r\ncontains this:--\r\n\r\n  A bright Mare, 12 hands high, one white foot behind, a white patch\r\n  below the saddle, near the side, a black main, a taile cut, a natural\r\n  ambler, about 10_li._ price, stolne, Decemb. 3. neare Guilford. John\r\n  Rylands, a butcher, tall and ruddy, flaxen haire, about 30 years of\r\n  age, is suspected. Mr. Brounloe, a stocking dier, near the Three\r\n  Craynes, in Thames’s Streete, will satisfy those who can make\r\n  discovery.\r\n\r\nIn 1655, Lilly the astrologer availed himself of what was then\r\nconsidered the new plan for ventilating a grievance, and accordingly, in\r\nthe _Perfect Diurnal_ of April 9-16, he published the following\r\nfull-fledged advertisement, one of the earliest extant:--\r\n\r\n  _An Advertisement from Mr William Lilly._\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS there are several flying reports, and many false and\r\n  scandalous speeches in the mouth of many people in this City, tending\r\n  unto this effect, viz.: That I, William Lilly, should predict or say\r\n  there would be a great Fire in or near the Old Exchange, and another\r\n  in St John’s Street, and another in the Strand near Temple Bar, and in\r\n  several other parts of the City. These are to certifie the whole City\r\n  that I protest before Almighty God, that I never wrote any such\r\n  thing, I never spoke any such word, or ever thought of any such thing,\r\n  or any or all of those particular Places or Streets, or any other\r\n  parts. These untruths are forged by ungodly men and women to disturb\r\n  the quiet people of this City, to amaze the Nation, and to cast\r\n  aspersions and scandals on me: God defend this City and all her\r\n  inhabitants, not only from Fire, but from the Plague, Pestilence, or\r\n  Famine, or any other accident or mortality that may be prejudicial\r\n  unto her greatnesse.\r\n\r\nThis, if noticed and recollected, must have destroyed, or at least\r\ndamaged, Lilly’s fame, when the great fire really did take place; but\r\nthen eleven years is a long time, long enough indeed to have included\r\nmany and various prophecies. Certainly modern astrologers would have\r\nturned to account the mere fact of having been accused of prophesying\r\nsuch a fire or any portion of it. In a previous chapter we have given a\r\nspecimen of the earliest advertisements with regard to the coaching\r\narrangements of this time, and now append the following, which would\r\nseem to show, singular as it may appear, that the simpler form, in fact\r\nthe first principle, of travelling by means of saddle-horses, was not\r\narranged until after coaches had been regularly appointed. It appears in\r\nthe _Mercurius Politicus_ toward the end of the year 1658:--\r\n\r\n  _The Postmasters on_ Chester _Road, petitioning, have received Order,\r\n  and do accordingly publish the following advertisement:--_\r\n\r\n  ALL Gentlemen, Merchants, and others, who have occasion to travel\r\n  between _London_ and _Westchester_, _Manchester_, and _Warrington_, or\r\n  any other town upon that Road, for the accommodation of Trade,\r\n  dispatch of Business, and ease of Purse, upon every Monday, Wednesday,\r\n  and Friday Morning, betwixt Six and ten of the Clock, at the house of\r\n  Mr _Christopher Charteris_, at the sign of the Hart’s-Horn, in\r\n  West-Smithfield, and Post-Master there, and at the Post-Master of\r\n  _Chester_, at the Post-Master of _Manchester_, and at the Post-master\r\n  of _Warrington_, may have a good and able single Horse, or more,\r\n  furnished at Threepence the Mile, without the charge of a Guide; and\r\n  so likewise at the house of Mr _Thomas Challenor_, Post-Master, at\r\n  _Stone_ in Staffordshire, upon every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday’s\r\n  Morning, to go for _London_. And so likewise at all the several\r\n  Post-Masters upon the Road, who will have all such set days so many\r\n  Horses with Furniture in readiness to furnish the Riders without any\r\n  stay to carry them to or from any the places aforesaid, in Four days,\r\n  as well to _London_ as from thence, and to places nearer in less time,\r\n  according as their occasions shall require, they ingaging at the first\r\n  Stage where they take Horse, for the safe delivery of the same to the\r\n  next immediate Stage, and not to ride that Horse without consent of\r\n  the Post-Master by whom he rides, and so from Stage to Stage to the\r\n  Journeys end. _All those who intend to ride this way are desired to\r\n  give a little notice beforehand, if conveniently they can, to the\r\n  several Post-masters where they first take horse, whereby they may be\r\n  furnished with so many Horses as the Riders shall require with\r\n  expedition._ This undertaking began the 28 of _June_ 1658 at all the\r\n  Places abovesaid, and so continues by the several Post-Masters.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to understand how, even if he received notice beforehand, the\r\nfirst postmaster was enabled to guarantee the readiness of the remaining\r\nofficials, unless indeed messengers were constantly passing backwards\r\nand forwards on each route. The intimation that the threepence per mile\r\ndoes not include a guide does something to clear up the mystery, and at\r\nthe same time gives an idea as to the state of the roads at that time.\r\nOne would imagine from the existence of such a being that the track was\r\nacross a morass, or by the side of a precipice, and not along a highroad\r\nof “merrie England,” in those good old times for which so many sigh now.\r\nWho, although the necessity for the highway is far less than it was two\r\nhundred years ago, can imagine a guide being required nowadays for no\r\nother purpose than that of preventing the wayfarer from straying off the\r\nbeaten track, and losing his horse, and probably himself, in some\r\ngigantic slough or quagmire! It is with difficulty one can now realise\r\nto himself the fact, that as late as the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, the interior of the country was little better than a\r\nwilderness; but that it was so may be easily gathered by a reference to\r\nPepys, who, in the diary of his journey to Bristol and back, makes\r\nfrequent mention of guides, and finds them far from unnecessary or\r\ninexpensive.\r\n\r\nThe servants of the olden time do not improve upon acquaintance, as the\r\nfollowing specimen advertisement from the _Mercurius Politicus_ of July\r\n1658 will show:--\r\n\r\n  IF any one can give notice of one _Edward Perry_, being about the age\r\n  of eighteen or nineteen years, of low stature, black hair, full of\r\n  pock-holes in his face; he weareth a new gray suit trimmed with green\r\n  and other ribbons, a light Cinnamon-colored cloak, and black hat, who\r\n  run away lately from his Master; they are desired to bring or send\r\n  word to _Tho. Firby_, Stationer, at Gray’s Inne gate, who will\r\n  thankfully reward them.\r\n\r\nThis gay and dashing youth, whose pock-holes were possibly in those days\r\nregarded as but beauty-spots, with the additional recommendation of\r\nshowing that their wearer had passed through the then dreaded and\r\nterrible ordeal, was doubtless an idle apprentice travelling in the\r\ndirection since made famous by one who served his full indentures. Ugly\r\nas the young gentleman just described may seem to the hypercritical\r\ntastes of the nineteenth century, he, as we will presently show, is a\r\nperfect beauty compared with any individual specimen picked out at\r\nrandom from the long lists of criminals published in old newspapers.\r\nFrom these lists some conception may be formed of the ravages of the\r\nsmall-pox, and its effect upon the appearance of the great bulk of the\r\npopulation. Every man and woman seems to have been more or less\r\nmarked--some slightly, some frightfully pitted or fretted, as the term\r\nthen was; yet even now we have every day instances of violent and\r\nignorant opposition to vaccination, an opposition which is loud-mouthed\r\nand possessed of considerable influence over the lower orders, who are\r\nled to believe that vaccination is the primary cause of all epidemic\r\ndisease, including that which it most professes to prevent.\r\n\r\nAbout this time highwaymen, who during the wars were almost unknown,\r\nbegan to exhibit a strong interest in the portable property of\r\ntravellers; and as they took horses whenever they could find them,\r\nnotices of lost, stolen, or strayed animals became frequent. It is much\r\nto be feared that the dashing knight of the road, who robbed the rich to\r\ngive to the poor, is a complete myth, and that the thieves who infested\r\nthe highway were neither brave nor handsome, and not above picking up,\r\nand keeping, the most trifling things that came in their way. The\r\nquality of these riders may be guessed by means of the following, from\r\nthe _Mercurius Politicus_ of February 1659, the subject of which,\r\nsingularly different from the “prancing prads” of which enthusiasts have\r\nwritten, seems to have been borrowed by one of them:--\r\n\r\n  A Small black NAG, some ten or eleven years old, no white at all,\r\n  bob-Tailed, wel forehanded, somewhat thin behind, thick Heels, and\r\n  goeth crickling and lamish behind at his first going out; the hair is\r\n  beat off upon his far Hip as broad as a twelvepence; he hath a black\r\n  leather Saddle trimmed with blew, and covered with a black\r\n  Calves-skin, its a little torn upon the Pummel; two new Girths of\r\n  white and green thread, and black Bridle, the Rein whereof is sowed on\r\n  the off side, and a knot to draw it on the near side, Stoln out of a\r\n  field at _Chelmsford_, 21 _February_ instant, from Mr _Henry Bullen_.\r\n  Whosoever can bring tidings to the said Mr _Bullen_, at _Bromfield_,\r\n  or to Mr _Newman_ at the Grocer’s Arms in _Cornhil_, shall have 20s.\r\n  for his pains.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed by some that the great amount of horse-stealing which\r\nprevailed during the Commonwealth, and for the next fifty years, was\r\ncaused by an inordinate scarcity of animals consequent upon casualties\r\nin the battle-field. This can hardly be correct, unless, indeed, the\r\nobject of the foe was always to kill horses and capture men, a state of\r\nthings hardly possible enough for the most determined theorist. One fact\r\nis noticeable, and seems to have been quite in the interest of the\r\nthieves--namely, that when at grass most horses were kept ready saddled.\r\nThis practice may have arisen during the Civil Wars from frequent\r\nemergency, a ready-saddled horse being of even greater comparative value\r\nthan the traditional bird in the hand; and we all know how hard it is to\r\ndepart from custom which has been once established. That the good man\r\nwas merciful to his beast in those days hardly appears probable, if we\r\nare to take the small black nag as evidence. His furniture, too, seems\r\nmuch more adapted for service than show, despite its variety of colours;\r\nand perhaps the animal may have been seized, as was not uncommon, by\r\nsome messenger of State making the best of his way from one part of the\r\nkingdom to another. Before the year 1636 there was no such thing as a\r\npostal service for the use of the people. The Court had, it is true, an\r\nestablishment for the forwarding of despatches, and in Cromwell’s time\r\nmuch attention was paid to it; but it was, after all, often in not much\r\nbetter form than when Bryan Tuke wrote as follows during the sixteenth\r\ncentury: “The Kinges Grace hath no mor ordinary postes, ne of many days\r\nhathe had, but betweene London and Calais.... For, sir, ye knowe well\r\nthat, except the hackney-horses betweene Gravesende and Dovour, there is\r\nno suche usual conveyance in post for men in this realme, as in the\r\naccustomed places of France and other partes; ne men can keepe horses in\r\nredynes withoute som way to bere the charges; but when placardes be sent\r\nfor suche cause [to order the immediate forwarding of some State\r\npacket], _the constables many tymes be fayne to take horses out of\r\nploues and cartes, wherein can be no extreme diligence_.” In Elizabeth’s\r\nreign a horse-post was established on each of the great roads for the\r\ntransmission of the letters for the Court; but the Civil Wars\r\nconsiderably interfered with this, and though in the time of Cromwell\r\npublic posts and conveyances were arranged, matters were in a generally\r\nloose state after his death, and during the reign of his sovereign\r\nmajesty Charles II. Truly travelling was then a venturesome matter.\r\n\r\nIn 1659, also, we come upon an advertisement having reference to a work\r\nof the great blind bard John Milton. It appears in the _Mercurius\r\nPoliticus_ of September, and is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  CONSIDERATIONS touching the likeliest means to remove Hirelings out of\r\n  the Church; wherein is also discours’d of Tithes, Church Fees, Church\r\n  Revenues, and whether any maintenance of Ministers can be settled by\r\n  Law. The author, J. M. Sold by _Livewel Chapman_, at the Crown in\r\n  Pope’s Head Alley.\r\n\r\nHere we are, then, brought as it were face to face with one of the\r\nbrightest names in the brightest list of England’s poets. This work is\r\nalmost swamped amid a host of quaintly and sometimes fiercely titled\r\ncontroversial works, with which the press at that time teemed. The poet\r\nseems to have known what was impending, and to have conscientiously put\r\nforth his protest. We can guess what weight it had with the hungering\r\ncrowds anxiously awaiting the coming change, and ready to be or do\r\nanything so long as place was provided for them. In something like\r\ncontrast with the foregoing is this we now select from a number of the\r\nsame paper in December of the same year:--\r\n\r\n  _George Weale_, a Cornish youth, about 18 or 19 years of age, serving\r\n  as an Apprentice at _Kingston_, with one Mr _Weale_, an Apothecary,\r\n  and his Uncle, about the time of the rising of the Counties _Kent_ and\r\n  _Surrey_, went secretly from his said Uncle, and is conceived to have\r\n  engaged in the same, and to be either dead or slain in some of those\r\n  fights, having never since been heard of, either by his said Uncle or\r\n  any of his Friends. If any person can give notice of the certainty of\r\n  the death of the said _George Weale_, let him repair to the said _Mr\r\n  Graunt_ his House in Drum-alley in Drury Lane, _London_; he shall have\r\n  twenty shillings for his pains.\r\n\r\nThis speaks volumes for the peculiarities of the times. Nowadays, in the\r\nevent of war, anxious relatives are soon put out of their suspense by\r\nmeans of careful bulletins and regular returns of killed and wounded;\r\nbut who can tell the amount of heart-sickness and hope deferred\r\nengendered by the “troubles” of the seventeenth century, or of anxious\r\nthought turned towards corpses mouldering far away, among whom was most\r\nlikely George Weale, perhaps the only one of the obscure men slain in\r\n“some of those fights,” whose name has been rescued from oblivion.\r\n\r\nIn 1660 we find Milton again in the hands of his publisher, just at the\r\ntime when the Restoration was considered complete, alone amid the pack\r\nthat were ready to fall down before the young King, who was to do so\r\nmuch to prove the value of monarchy as compared with the Commonwealth.\r\n“The advertisements,” says a writer, referring to this period, “which\r\nappeared during the time that Monk was temporising and sounding his way\r\nto the Restoration, form a capital barometer of the state of feeling\r\namong political men at that critical juncture. We see no more of the old\r\nFifth-Monarchy spirit abroad. Ministers of the steeple-houses evidently\r\nsee the storm coming, and cease their long-winded warnings to a\r\nbacksliding generation. Every one is either panting to take advantage of\r\nthe first sunshine of royal favour, or to deprecate its wrath, the\r\ncoming shadow of which is clearly seen. Meetings are advertised of those\r\npersons who have purchased sequestered estates, in order that they may\r\naddress the King to secure them in possession; Parliamentary aldermen\r\nrepudiate by the same means charges in the papers that their names are\r\nto be found in the list of those persons who ‘sat upon the tryal of the\r\nlate King;’ the works of ‘late’ bishops begin again to air themselves in\r\nthe Episcopal wind that is clearly setting in; and ‘The Tears, Sighs,\r\nComplaints, and Prayers of the Church of England’ appear in the\r\nadvertising columns, in place of the sonorous titles of sturdy old\r\nBaxter’s works. It is clear there is a great commotion at hand; the\r\nleaves are rustling, and the dust is moving.” In the midst of this,\r\nhowever, there was one still faithful to the “old cause,” as\r\nCommonwealth matters had got to be called by the Puritans; and on the\r\n8th of March, just when the shadow of the sceptre was once again thrown\r\nupon Great Britain, we find the following in the _Mercurius\r\nPoliticus_:--\r\n\r\n  THE ready and easie way to establish a free Commonwealth, and the\r\n  excellence thereof compared with the inconveniences and dangers of\r\n  readmitting Kingship in this Nation.

Yet it was so, and the degradation to which\r\nliterature may be submitted is proved by the fact that within the same\r\nspace of time his works were, in accordance with an order of the House\r\nof Commons, burned by the hangman.\r\n\r\nThe excessive loyalty exhibited about this time by the lawyers, who were\r\nthen, as now, quite able to look after their own interests, shows in\r\nrather a ludicrous light, viewed through the zealous officiousness of Mr\r\nNicholas Bacon, who must have been the fountspring of the following\r\neffusion, which appears in a June, 1660, number of the _Mercurius\r\nPoliticus_:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS one Capt. _Gouge_, a witness examined against the late King’s\r\n  Majesty, in those Records stiled himself of the Honorable Society of\r\n  _Gray’s_ Inne. These are to give notice that the said _Gouge_, being\r\n  long sought for, was providentially discovered in a disguise, seized\r\n  in that Society, and now in custody, being apprehended by the help of\r\n  some spectators that knew him, viewing of a banner with His Majesties\r\n  arms, set up just at the same time of His Majesties landing, on an\r\n  high tower in the same Society, by _Nicholas Bacon_, Esq., a member\r\n  thereof, as a memorial of so great a deliverance, and testimony of his\r\n  constant loyalty to His Majesty, and that the said _Gouge_ upon\r\n  examination confessed, That he was never admitted not so much as a\r\n  Clerk of that Society.\r\n\r\nThe King does not seem to have enjoyed his own very long before he was\r\nsubjected to loss by the dog-stealers, who, less ready to revere royalty\r\nthan the lawyers, led to the publication of the following in the\r\n_Mercurius Publicus_ of June 28, 1660:--\r\n\r\n  ☞ A Smooth Black DOG, less than a Grey-hound, with white under his\r\n  breast, belonging to the Kings Majesty, was taken from Whitehall, the\r\n  eighteenth day of this instant _June_, or thereabouts. If any one can\r\n  give notice to _John Ellis_, one of his Majesties servants, or to his\r\n  Majesties Back-Stairs, shall be well rewarded for their labour.\r\n\r\nAnd one who could very probably afford to be despoiled still less--one\r\nof the poor Cavaliers who expected so much from the representative of\r\nDivine right, and who were to be so terribly disappointed--is also\r\nvictimised, his whole stock of bag and baggage being annexed by some of\r\nthose vagabonds who only see in any public excitement a means to their\r\nown enrichment at the expense of others. Fancy the state of mind of the\r\nelderly gentleman who is so anxious to present himself at Court, while\r\nwaiting the return of the articles thus advertised in the _Mercurius\r\nPublicus_ of July 5, 1660:--\r\n\r\n  A LEATHERN Portmantle lost at Sittingburn or Rochester, when his\r\n  Majesty came thither, wherein was a suit of Camolet Holland, with two\r\n  little laces in a seam, eight pair of white Gloves, and a pair of Does\r\n  leather; about twenty yards of skie-colourd Ribbon twelvepenny broad,\r\n  and a whole piece of black Ribbon tenpenny broad, a cloath\r\n  lead-coloured cloak, with store of linnen; a pair of shooes, slippers,\r\n  a Montero, and other things; all which belong to a gentleman (a near\r\n  servant to His Majesty) who hath been too long imprisoned and\r\n  sequestered to be now robbed, when all men hope to enjoy their own. If\r\n  any can give notice, they may leave word with Mr _Samuel Merne_, His\r\n  Majesties Book-binder, at his house in Little Britain, and they shall\r\n  be thankfully rewarded.\r\n\r\nThis _Mercurius Publicus_ from which we have just quoted is said to be\r\nthe _Politicus_ we have mentioned in reference to earlier\r\nadvertisements, which turned courtier in imitation of the general\r\nexample, and changed its name also in emulation of popular practice. All\r\nEngland seemed then to have gone mad with excessive loyalty, and it is\r\nno wonder that Charles was surprised that he could have been persuaded\r\nto stop away so long. The columns of the _Mercurius Publicus_ were\r\nplaced entirely under the direction of the King, and instead of the\r\nslashing articles against malignants, which were wont to appear before\r\nits change of title, it contains, under Restoration dates, virulent\r\nattacks upon the Puritans, and inquiries after his Majesty’s favourite\r\ndogs, which had a curious knack of becoming stolen or lost. In addition\r\nto the canine advertisement already given, we take the following, which\r\nappears during July, and which would seem to have been dictated, if not\r\nactually written, by Charles:--\r\n\r\n  ☞ We must call upon you again for a Black Dog, between a Grey-hound\r\n  and a Spaniel, no white about him, onely a streak on his Brest, and\r\n  Tayl a little bobbed. It is His Majesties own Dog, and doubtless was\r\n  stoln, for the Dog was not born nor bred in _England_, and would never\r\n  forsake his Master. Whosoever findes him may acquaint any at Whitehal,\r\n  for the Dog was better known at Court than those who stole him. Will\r\n  they never leave robbing His Majesty? must he not keep a Dog? This\r\n  Dogs place (though better than some imagine) is the only place which\r\n  nobody offers to beg.\r\n\r\nThis is evidently the dog advertised before, and seems to have been an\r\nespecial favourite with the merry monarch, who, one might think, would\r\nhave had so many dogs that he could not possibly have missed an\r\nindividual from their number. Pepys about this time describes the King,\r\nwith a train of spaniels and other dogs at his heels, lounging along and\r\nfeeding the water-fowl in the Park; and on later occasions he was often\r\nseen talking to his favourite Nell Gwyn as she leaned from her garden\r\nwall in Pall Mall, whilst his four-footed favourites were grouped about.\r\nIt was possibly on these occasions that the gentlemen who have such an\r\nextraordinary faculty for “finding” dogs, even unto this day, saw their\r\nopportunities, and marched off with the choicest specimens. Certainly\r\nthe dogs were being constantly lost, and just as constantly advertised.\r\nIn turn we find him inquiring after “a little brindled grey-hound bitch,\r\nhaving her two hinder feet white;” for a “white-haired spaniel,\r\nsmooth-coated, with large red or yellowish spots;” and for a “black\r\nmastiff dog, with cropped ears and cut tail.” So it would seem that,\r\nfond as his Majesty was of dogs, he was not above their being cropped\r\nand trimmed in the manner which has of late years caused all the forces\r\nof a well-known society to be arrayed against the “fancy” and the\r\n“finders.” And not alone did the King advertise his lost favourites. As\r\nthe fashion was set, so it was followed, and the dogmen’s lives must\r\nthen have been cast in pleasant places indeed, for Prince Rupert, “my\r\nlord Albemarle,” the Duke of Buckingham, and many other potent\r\nseigniors, are constantly inquiring after strayed or stolen animals. The\r\nchange in the general habits of the time is very clearly shown by these\r\nadvertisements. The Puritans did not like sporting animals of any kind,\r\nand it has been said that no dog would have followed a Fifth-Monarchy\r\nman. Perhaps this dislike accounts for the total absence of all\r\nadvertisements having reference to field-sports, or to animals connected\r\ntherewith, until the return of the Court to England. With its return\r\ncame in once more an aristocratic amusement which had faded out during\r\nthe stern days of the Commonwealth, hawking, and we are reminded of this\r\nby the following advertisement for a lost lanner, which appears in the\r\n_Mercurius Publicus_ of September 6, 1660:--\r\n\r\n  Richard Finney, Esquire, of Alaxton, in Leicestershire, about a\r\n  fortnight since, lost a LANNER from that place; she hath neither Bells\r\n  nor Varvels; she is a white Hawk, and her long feathers and sarcels\r\n  are both in the blood. If any one can give tidings thereof to Mr\r\n  Lambert at the Golden Key in Fleet-street, they shall have forty\r\n  shillings for their pains.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that the _Mercurius_ changed its name from _Politicus_ to\r\n_Publicus_ out of compliment to the new King and his Court, second\r\nthoughts seem to have been taken, and the original name resumed, for\r\nthere is a _Mercurius Politicus_ in November 1660, from which is the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_, you are desired to take notice, That Mr _Theophilus\r\n  Buckworth_ doth at his house on _Mile-end Green_ make and expose to\r\n  sale, for the publick good, those so famous _Lozenges_ or\r\n  _Pectorals_, approved for the cure of Consumption, Coughs, Catarrhs,\r\n  Asthmas, Hoarseness, Strongness of Breath, Colds in general, Diseases\r\n  incident to the Lungs, and a sovoraign Antidote against the Plague,\r\n  and all other contagious Diseases, and obstructions of the Stomach:\r\n  And for more convenience of the people, constantly leaveth them sealed\r\n  up with his coat of arms on the papers, with Mr _Rich. Lowndes_ (as\r\n  formerly), at the sign of the White Lion, near the little north door\r\n  of _Pauls Church_; Mr _Henry Seile_, over against _S. Dunstan’s_\r\n  Church in Fleet Street; Mr _William Milward_, at _Westminster_ Hall\r\n  Gate; Mr _John Place_, at _Furnivals Inn Gate_ in Holborn; and Mr\r\n  _Robert Horn_, at the Turk’s Head near the entrance of the Royal\r\n  Exchange, Booksellers, and no others.\r\n\r\n  This is published to prevent the designs of divers Pretenders, who\r\n  counterfeit the said Lozenges, to the disparagement of the said\r\n  Gentleman, and great abuse of the people.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this that quack medicines are by no means modern\r\ninventions--in fact, the wonder is, if our ancestors took a tithe of the\r\narticles advertised, that there is any present generation at all; so\r\nnumerous and, even according to their own showing, powerful were the\r\nspecifics advertised on every possible opportunity and in connection\r\nwith every possible disease. As, however, we shall devote special space\r\nto charlatans further on, we will here simply pass to the following,\r\nwhich promises rather too much for the price. This is also in the\r\n_Mercurius Politicus_, and appears in December 1660:--\r\n\r\n  MOST Excellent and Approved _Dentifrices_ to scour and cleanse the\r\n  Teeth, making them white as Ivory, preserves from the Toothach; so\r\n  that, being constantly used, the parties using it are never troubled\r\n  with the Toothach; it fastens the Teeth, sweetens the Breath, and\r\n  preserves the mouth and gums from Cankers and Imposthumes. Made by\r\n  _Robert Turner_, Gentleman; and the right are onely to be had at\r\n  _Thomas Rookes_, Stationer, at the Holy Lamb at the East end of St\r\n  Pauls Church, near the School, in sealed papers, at 12d. the paper.\r\n\r\n  _The Reader is desired to beware of counterfeits._\r\n\r\nWe can now mark the advent of those monstrous flowing wigs which were in\r\nfashion for nearly a century, and may be fairly assumed to have made\r\ntheir appearance about the date of this advertisement, which was\r\npublished in the _Newes_ of February 4, 1663:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS _George Grey_, a Barber and Perrywigge-maker, over against the\r\n  _Greyhound Tavern_, in _Black Fryers_, _London_, stands obliged to\r\n  serve some particular Persons of eminent Condition and Quality in his\r\n  way of Employment: It is therefore Notifyed at his desire, that any\r\n  one having long flaxen hayr to sell may repayr to him the said _George\r\n  Grey_, and they shall have 10s. the ounce, and for any other long fine\r\n  hayr after the Rate of 5s. or 7s. the ounce.\r\n\r\nPepys, in his quaint and humorous manner, describes how Chapman, a\r\nperiwig-dresser, cut off his hair to make up one of these immense\r\ncoverings for him, much to the trouble of his servants, Jane and Bessy.\r\nHe also states that “two perriwiggs, one whereof cost me £3 and the\r\nother 40s.,” have something to do with the depletion of his ready money\r\non the 30th of October 1663. On November 2nd, he says, “I heard the Duke\r\n[Buckingham] say that he was going to wear a perriwigg; and they say the\r\nKing also will. I never till this day observed that the King is mighty\r\ngray.” And then on Lord’s day, November 8th, he says, with infinite\r\nquaintness, “To church, where I found that my coming in a perriwigg did\r\nnot prove so strange as I was afraid it would, for I thought that all\r\nthe church would presently have cast their eyes all upon me.” Pepys was,\r\nit seems, possessed of that rather unpleasant consciousness which\r\nprompts a man who wears anything new or strange for the first time to\r\nbelieve that all the world, even that portion of it which has never seen\r\nhim before, knows he feels anxious and uncomfortable because he has got\r\nnew clothes on. The price, ten shillings the ounce, shows that there\r\nmust have been an exceptionally heavy demand for flaxen colour by the\r\nwearers of the new-fashioned wigs. Judging by the advertisements just\r\nquoted, as well as by those which follow, there can be no controverting\r\nthe statement that the reign of Charles II. “was characterised by\r\nfrivolous amusements and by a love of dress and vicious excitement, in\r\nthe midst of which pestilence stalked like a mocking fiend, and the\r\ngreat conflagration lit up the masquerade with its lurid and angry\r\nglare. Together with the emasculate tone of manners, a disposition to\r\npersonal violence stained the latter part of this and the succeeding\r\nreign. The audacious seizure of the crown jewels by Blood; the attack\r\nupon the Duke of Ormond by the same desperado, that nobleman having\r\nactually been dragged from his coach in St James’s Street in the\r\nevening, and carried, bound upon the saddle-bow of Blood’s horse, as far\r\nas Hyde Park Corner, before he could be rescued; the slitting of Sir\r\nJohn Coventry’s nose in the Haymarket by the King’s guard; and the\r\nmurder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey on Primrose Hill, are familiar\r\ninstances of the prevalence of this lawless spirit.” There is still one\r\nother memorable and dastardly assault to note, that on “Glorious John,”\r\nand we shall do so in due course.\r\n\r\nThe _London Gazette_ now appears upon the scene, and this is noticeable,\r\nbecause of all the papers started before, or for a very considerable\r\ntime after, this is the only one which has still an existence. It has\r\nbeen stated by some writers to have first appeared at Oxford during the\r\ntime the Court took up its abode there, while the Great Plague was\r\nraging, but that this was not so is shown by the following, which is\r\nextracted from the _London Gazette_ of January 22, 1664, nearly twelve\r\nmonths before the outbreak of the Plague. The fact is that during the\r\nresidence of the King and Court at Oxford, the official organ changed\r\nits title, and was called the _Oxford Gazette_, to resume its original\r\nname as soon as it resumed its original publishing office.[26]\r\n\r\n  A TRUE representation of the Rhonoserous and Elephant, lately brought\r\n  from the East Indies to London, drawn after the life, and curiously\r\n  engraven in Mezzotinto, printed upon a large sheet of paper. Sold by\r\n  PIERCE TEMPEST, at the Eagle and Child in the Strand, over against\r\n  Somerset House, Water Gate.\r\n\r\nThe ignorance of natural history at this time seems to have been\r\nsomewhat marvellous, and anything in the way of a collection of\r\ncuriosities was sure to attract a credulous multitude, as is shown by\r\nanother notice, published in the _News_ of a date close to that of the\r\nforegoing. The articles are rather scanty, to be sure, but probably the\r\n“huge thighbone of a giant,” whatever it was in reality, was in itself\r\nsufficient to attract, to say nothing of the mummy and torpedo.\r\n\r\n  AT the Mitre, near the west end of St Paul’s, is to be seen a rare\r\n  Collection of Curiosityes, much resorted to and admired by persons of\r\n  great learning and quality; among which a choyce Egyptian Mummy, with\r\n  hieroglyphicks; the Ant-Beare of Brasil; a Remora; a Torpedo; the Huge\r\n  Thighbone of a Giant; a Moon Fish; a Tropic Bird, &c.\r\n\r\nEvidently something must have been known of mummies, or how could the\r\nexhibitor tell that his was a choice one? Our next item introduces us to\r\none of those old beliefs which are still to be found in remote parts of\r\nthe country. The King, like any mountebank or charlatan, advertises the\r\ntime when he will receive, for the purpose of giving the royal touch,\r\nsupposed to be sufficient to cure the horrible distemper. Surely he of\r\nall people must have known how futile was the experiment; and it is\r\npassing strange that a people who had tried, condemned, and executed one\r\nking like any common man, should have put faith in such an announcement\r\nas that published in the _Public Intelligencer_ of May 1664, which runs\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n  WHITEHALL, May 14, 1664. His Sacred Majesty, having declared it to be\r\n  his Royal will and purpose to continue the healing of his people for\r\n  the Evil during the Month of May, and then to give over till\r\n  Michaelmas next, I am commanded to give notice thereof, that the\r\n  people may not come up to Town in the Interim and lose their labour.\r\n\r\nSurely such men as Sedley, Rochester, Buckingham, and even Charles\r\nhimself, must have laughed at the infatuation of the multitude; for if\r\never there was a king whose touch was less likely than another’s to cure\r\nthe evil, that king was, in our humble opinion, “his Sacred Majesty”\r\nCharles II. But then people were prepared to go any lengths to make up\r\nfor their shortcomings in the previous reign. There was possibly a\r\npolitical significance about these manifestations of royal ability and\r\nclemency, and some enthusiasts, who believe devoutly in the triumph of\r\nmind over matter, think there is reason to believe in the efficacy of\r\nthe touch in scrofulous affections, and even believe that people did\r\nreally recover after undergoing the process. Dr Tyler Smith, who has\r\nwritten on the subject, boldly states his belief that the emotion felt\r\nby these poor stricken people who came within the influence of the\r\nKing’s “Sacred Majesty” acted upon them as a powerful tonic; though, as\r\nthe King always bestowed a gold piece upon the patient, we think that if\r\ngood was derived, it was derived from the comfort procured by that--for\r\nthose who suffered and believed were generally in the lowest and poorest\r\nrank of life--and perhaps travelling and change of air had something to\r\ndo with it as well. If the arguments of those who believe in the\r\nemotional effect are to be admitted, it must be allowed by parity of\r\nreasoning that where the touch failed, its failure would be likely to\r\ncause the sufferers to become rabid republicans, the Divine right having\r\nrefused to exhibit itself. Maybe these latter symptoms, like the\r\nsymptoms of other diseases, did not develop in the individual, but came\r\nout in course of generations, which may perhaps account for the large\r\namount of democracy which has exhibited itself during the present\r\ncentury. There is certainly something rather ludicrous in the fact that\r\nthe practice of touching for the evil ceased with the death of Anne;\r\nnot because the people had become more enlightened, but because the\r\nsovereigns who followed her were supposed to have lost the medicinal\r\nvirtue through being kings merely by Act of Parliament, and not by\r\nDivine right.\r\n\r\nThe reaction which set in from the strait-laced rule of the Puritans at\r\nthe time of the Restoration, must have reached its height about 1664, if\r\nwe may judge by the advertisements then constantly inserted, which\r\nreflect the love of pleasure and folly exhibited by all classes, as if\r\nthey were anxious to make up for previous restrictions. In fact, the\r\nchief inquiries are after lacework, or valuables lost at masquerade or\r\nwater party, announcements of lotteries at Whitehall, of jewels and\r\ntapestry, and other things to be sold. The following is a fair specimen\r\nof the advertisements of the time, and appears in the _News_ of August\r\n4, 1664:--\r\n\r\n  LOST on the 27th July, about Boswell Yard or Drury Lane, a Ladyes\r\n  picture set in gold, and three Keys, with divers other little things\r\n  in a perfumed pocket. Whosoever shall give notice of or bring the said\r\n  picture to Mr Charles Coakine, Goldsmith, near Staples Inne, Holborn,\r\n  shall have 4 times the value of the gold for his payns.\r\n\r\nThere are also about this time all sorts of quack and nostrum\r\nadvertisements, an “antimonial cup,” by means of which every kind of\r\ndisease was to be cured, being apparently very popular. Sir Kenelm\r\nDigby, a learned knight, who is said to have feasted his wife with\r\ncapons fattened upon serpents for the purpose of making her fair,\r\nadvertises a book in which is shown a method of curing the severest\r\nwounds by a sympathetic powder. But even the knight’s efforts pall\r\nbefore the following, which will go far to show the superstitious leaven\r\nwhich still hung about the populace:--\r\n\r\n  SMALL BAGGS to hang about Children’s necks, which are excellent both\r\n  for the _prevention and cure_ of the _Rickets_, and to ease Children\r\n  in breeding of Teeth, are prepared by Mr Edmund Buckworth, and\r\n  constantly to be had at Mr Philip Clark’s, Keeper of the Library in\r\n  the Fleet, and nowhere else, at 5 shillings a bagge.\r\n\r\nWe see in the papers of 1665 an increased number of advertisements for\r\nlost and stolen animals, mostly those used in connection with sport; but\r\nthis does not go to prove that more dogs, hawks, &c., were missing, so\r\nmuch as that the advantages of advertising were being discovered\r\nthroughout the country; and as London was the only place in which at\r\nthat time a newspaper was published, the cry after stray favourites\r\nalways came up to town. Strange, indeed, are many of the advertisements\r\nabout sports long since passed from amongst us, and the very phrases of\r\nwhich have died out of the language. It seems hard to imagine that hawks\r\nin all the glory of scarlet hoods were carried upon fair ladies’ wrists,\r\nor poised themselves when uncovered to view their prey, so late as the\r\ntime of Charles II., but that it was so, an advertisement already\r\nquoted, as well as the following, shows. It is taken from the\r\n_Intelligencer_ of November 6, 1665:--\r\n\r\n  LOST on the 30 October, 1665, an intermix’d Barbary Tercel Gentle,\r\n  engraven in Varvels, Richard Windwood, of Ditton Park, in the county\r\n  of Bucks, Esq. For more particular marks--if the Varvels be taken\r\n  off--the 4th feather in one of the wings Imped, and the third pounce\r\n  of the right foot broke. If any one inform Sir William Roberts, Knight\r\n  and Baronet (near Harrow-on-the-Hill, in the county of Middlesex), or\r\n  Mr William Philips, at the King’s Head in Paternoster Row, of the\r\n  Hawk, he shall be sufficiently rewarded.\r\n\r\nInquiries for hawks and goshawks are by no means scarce, and so we may\r\nimagine that these implements of hunting were hardly so much to be\r\ndepended upon as those from the workshop of art and not of nature, which\r\nare in use in the present day. Indeed, the falcon seemed to care much\r\nless, when once set free, for his keeper, than writers of books are\r\nprone to imagine. The King was apparently no more fortunate than the\r\nrest of those who indulged in falconry, for in a copy of the _London\r\nGazette_, late in 1667, the following is seen:--\r\n\r\n  A Sore ger Falcon of His Majesty, lost the 13 of August, who had one\r\n  Varvel of his Keeper, Roger Higs, of Westminster, Gent. Whosoever hath\r\n  taken her up and give notice Sir Allan Apsley, Master of His Majesties\r\n  Hawks at St James’s, shall be rewarded for his paines. Back-Stairs in\r\n  Whitehall.\r\n\r\nSir Allan Apsley was the brother-in-law of the celebrated Colonel\r\nHutchinson, and brother of the devoted wife whose story everybody has\r\nread. The next advertisement we shall select is published in the _London\r\nGazette_ of May 10, 1666, and has reference to the precautions taken to\r\nprevent the spread of the Plague. Long before this all public notices of\r\nan idle and frivolous nature have ceased, amusements seem to have lost\r\ntheir charm, and it is evident from a study of the advertisements alone,\r\nthat some great disturbing cause is at work among the good citizens. No\r\nlonger does the authorised gambling under the roof of Whitehall go on;\r\nno more are books of Anacreontics published; stopped are all the\r\nassignations but a short time back so frequent; and no longer are\r\ninquiries made after lockets and perfumed bags, dropped during amorous\r\ndalliance, or in other pursuit of pleasure. Death, it is evident, is\r\nbusy at work. The quacks, and the writers of semi-blasphemous pamphlets,\r\nhave it all to themselves, and doubtless batten well in this time of\r\ntrouble. The Plague is busy doing its deadly work, and already the city\r\nhas been deserted by all who can fly thence, and only those who are\r\ndetained by duty, sickness, poverty, or the want of a clean bill of\r\nhealth, remain. These bills or licences to depart were only granted by\r\nthe Lord Mayor, and the greatest influence often failed to obtain them,\r\nas after the Plague once showed strength it was deemed necessary to\r\nprevent by all and every means the spread of the contagion throughout\r\nthe country. The advertisement chosen gives a singular instance of the\r\nmanner in which those who had neglected to depart early were penned\r\nwithin the walls:--\r\n\r\n  _Nicholas Hurst_, an Upholsterer, over against the Rose Tavern, in\r\n  Russell-street, Covent-Garden, whose Maid Servant dyed lately of the\r\n  Sickness, fled on Monday last out of his house, taking with him\r\n  several Goods and Household Stuff, and was afterwards followed by one\r\n  Doctor Cary and Richard Bayle with his wife and family, who lodged in\r\n  the same house; but Bayle having his usual dwelling-house in\r\n  Waybridge, in Surrey. Whereof we are commanded to give this Public\r\n  Notice, that diligent search may be made for them, and the houses in\r\n  which any of their persons or goods shall be found may be shut up by\r\n  the next Justice of the Peace, or other his Majesty’s Officers of\r\n  Justice, and notice immediately given to some of his Majesty’s Privy\r\n  Councill, or to one of his Majesty’s principal Secretaries of State.\r\n\r\nA great demand seems at this time to have been made for an electuary\r\nmuch advertised as a certain preventive of the Plague, which was to be\r\ndrunk at the Green Dragon, Cheapside, at sixpence a pint. This is,\r\nhowever, only one among hundreds of specifics which continued to be\r\nthrust upon the public in the columns of the papers, until the real\r\ndeliverer of the plague-stricken people appeared--a dreadful deliverer,\r\nit is true, but the only one. The Great Fire, which commenced on the 2nd\r\nof September 1666, and destroyed thirteen thousand houses, rendering\r\nmyriads of people homeless, penniless, and forlorn, had its good side,\r\ninasmuch as by it the Plague was utterly driven out of its stronghold,\r\nbut not until nearly a hundred thousand persons had perished. Imagine\r\ntwo such calamities coming almost together; but the purgation by fire\r\nwas the only one which could fairly be expected to prove effectual, as\r\nit destroyed the loathsome charnel-houses which would long have held the\r\ntaint, and removed a great part of the cause which led to the power of\r\nthe fell epidemic. We have in the preceding chapter referred to the\r\npaucity of advertisements which appeared in reference to the new\r\naddresses of those who had been burnt out, and a writer a few years back\r\nmakes the following remark upon the same subject: “Singularly enough,\r\nbut faint traces of this overwhelming calamity, as it was considered at\r\nthe time, can be gathered from the current advertisements. Although the\r\nentire population of the city was rendered houseless, and had to encamp\r\nin the surrounding fields, where they extemporised shops and streets,\r\nnot one hint of such a circumstance can be found in the public\r\nannouncements of the period. No circumstance could afford a greater\r\nproof of the little use made by the trading community of this means of\r\npublicity in the time of Charles II. If a fire only a hundredth part so\r\ndestructive were to occur in these days, the columns of the press would\r\nimmediately be full of the new addresses of the burnt-out shopkeepers;\r\nand those who were not even damaged by it would take care to ‘improve\r\nthe occasion’ to their own advantage. We look in vain through the pages\r\nof the _London Gazette_ of this and the following year for one such\r\nannouncement: not even the tavern-keeper tells us the number of his\r\nbooth in Goodman’s-fields, although quack medicine flourished away in\r\nits columns as usual.” We have already shown that one advertisement at\r\nleast was published in reference to removal caused by the fire, but as\r\nit did not appear till six or seven years afterwards, it is a solitary\r\nexception to the rule, indeed. In 1667, notifications occurred now and\r\nthen of some change in the site of a Government office, caused by the\r\ndisturbances incident on the fire, or of the intention to rebuild by\r\ncontract some public structure. Of these the following, which appears in\r\nthe _London Gazette_, is a good specimen:--\r\n\r\n  ALL Artificers of the several Trades that must be used in Rebuilding\r\n  the Royal Exchange may take notice, that the Committee appointed for\r\n  management of that Work do sit at the end of the long gallery in\r\n  Gresham Colledge every Monday in the forenoon, there and then to treat\r\n  with such as are fit to undertake the same.\r\n\r\nAs nothing occurs in the way of advertisements worthy of remark or\r\ncollection for the next few years, we will take this convenient\r\nopportunity of obtaining a brief breathing space.\r\n\r\n  [26] The _London Gazette_ was first published 22d August 1642. The\r\n  first number of the existing “published-by-authority” series was\r\n  imprinted first at Oxford, where the Court was stationed for fear of\r\n  the Plague, on November 7, 1665, and afterwards at London on February\r\n  5, 1666.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n_CONCLUSION OF SEVENTEENTH CENTURY._\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us commence here with the year 1674, a period when the rages and\r\nfashions, the plague and fire, and the many things treated of by means\r\nof advertisements in the preceding chapter, had plunged England into a\r\nmost unhappy condition. The reaction from Puritanism was great, but the\r\nreaction from royalty and extravagance threatened to be still greater.\r\nSpeaking of the state of affairs about this time, a famous historian,\r\nwho has paid particular attention to the latter part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, says: “A few months after the termination of hostilities on the\r\nContinent, came a great crisis in English politics. Towards such a\r\ncrisis things had been tending during eighteen years. The whole stock of\r\npopularity, great as it was, with which the King had commenced his\r\nadministration, had long been expended. To loyal enthusiasm had\r\nsucceeded profound disaffection. The public mind had now measured back\r\nagain the space over which it had passed between 1640 and 1660, and was\r\nonce more in the state in which it had been when the Long Parliament\r\nmet. The prevailing discontent was compounded of many feelings. One of\r\nthese was wounded national pride. That generation had seen England,\r\nduring a few years, allied on equal terms with France, victorious over\r\nHolland and Spain, the mistress of the sea, the terror of Rome, the head\r\nof the Protestant interest. Her resources had not diminished; and it\r\nmight have been expected that she would have been, at least, as highly\r\nconsidered in Europe under a legitimate king, strong in the affection\r\nand willing obedience of his subjects, as she had been under an usurper\r\nwhose utmost vigilance and energy were required to keep down a mutinous\r\npeople. Yet she had, in consequence of the imbecility and meanness of\r\nher rulers, sunk so low, that any German or Italian principality which\r\nbrought five thousand men into the field, was a more important member of\r\nthe commonwealth of nations. With the sense of national humiliation was\r\nmingled anxiety for civil liberty. Rumours, indistinct indeed, but\r\nperhaps the more alarming by reason of their indistinctness, imputed to\r\nthe Court a deliberate design against all the constitutional rights of\r\nEnglishmen. It had even been whispered that this design was to be\r\ncarried into effect by the intervention of foreign arms. The thought of\r\nsuch intervention made the blood, even of the Cavaliers, boil in their\r\nveins. Some who had always professed the doctrine of non-resistance in\r\nits full extent, were now heard to mutter that there was one limitation\r\nto that doctrine. If a foreign force were brought over to coerce the\r\nnation, they would not answer for their own patience. But neither\r\nnational pride nor anxiety for public liberty had so great an influence\r\non the popular mind as hatred of the Roman Catholic religion. That\r\nhatred had become one of the ruling passions of the community, and was\r\nas strong in the ignorant and profane as in those who were Protestants\r\nfrom conviction. The cruelties of Mary’s reign--cruelties which even in\r\nthe most accurate and sober narrative excite just detestation, and which\r\nwere neither accurately nor soberly related in the popular\r\nmartyrologies--the conspiracies against Elizabeth, and above all, the\r\nGunpowder Plot, had left in the minds of the vulgar a deep and bitter\r\nfeeling, which was kept up by annual commemorations, prayers, bonfires,\r\nand processions. It should be added that those classes which were\r\npeculiarly distinguished by attachment to the throne, the clergy and the\r\nlanded gentry, had peculiar reasons for regarding the Church of Rome\r\nwith aversion. The clergy trembled for their benefices, the landed\r\ngentry for their abbeys and great tithes. While the memory of the reign\r\nof the Saints was still recent, hatred of Popery had in some degree\r\ngiven place to hatred of Puritanism; but during the eighteen years which\r\nhad elapsed since the Restoration, the hatred of Puritanism had abated,\r\nand the hatred of Popery had increased.... The King was suspected by\r\nmany of a leaning towards Rome. His brother and heir-presumptive was\r\nknown to be a bigoted Roman Catholic. The first Duchess of York had died\r\na Roman Catholic. James had then, in defiance of the remonstrances of\r\nthe House of Commons, taken to wife the Princess Mary of Modena, another\r\nRoman Catholic. If there should be sons by this marriage, there was\r\nreason to fear that they might be bred Roman Catholics, and that a long\r\nsuccession of princes hostile to the established faith might sit on the\r\nEnglish throne. The constitution had recently been violated for the\r\npurpose of protecting the Roman Catholics from the penal laws. The ally\r\nby whom the policy of England had during many years been chiefly\r\ngoverned, was not only a Roman Catholic, but a persecutor of the\r\nReformed Churches. Under such circumstances, it is not strange that the\r\ncommon people should have been inclined to apprehend a return of the\r\ntimes of her whom they called Bloody Mary.” Such was the unhappy state\r\nof affairs at this period, and though its effect is soon shown in the\r\nadvertisement columns of the papers, one would think times were piping\r\nand peaceful indeed to read the following, extracted from the _London\r\nGazette_ of October 15-19, 1674:--\r\n\r\n  _WHITEHALL, October 17._--A square Diamond with his Majesty’s Arms\r\n  upon it having been this day lost out of a seal in or about Whitehall,\r\n  or St James’s Park or House; Any person that shall have found the same\r\n  is required to bring it to _William Chiffinch_, Esq., Keeper of his\r\n  Majesty’s Closet, and he shall have ten pounds for a Reward.\r\n\r\nDoubtless this Chiffinch, the degraded being who lived but to pander to\r\nthe debauched tastes of his royal and profligate employer, thought\r\nnothing of politics or of the signs of the times, and contented himself\r\nwith the affairs of the Backstairs, caring little for Titus Oates, and\r\nless for his victims. Some short time after the foregoing was published\r\n(March 20-23, 1675), Chiffinch published another loss in the _Gazette_.\r\nThis is it:--\r\n\r\n  FLOWN out of St James’s Park, on Thursday night last, a Goose and a\r\n  Gander, brought from the river Gambo in the East Indies, on the Head,\r\n  Back and Wings they are of a shining black, under the Throat about the\r\n  Eyes and the Belly white. They have Spurs on the pinions of the Wings,\r\n  about an inch in length, the Beaks and Legs of a muddy red; they are\r\n  shaped like a Muscovy Mallard, but larger and longer legg’d. Whoever\r\n  gives notice to Mr Chiffinch at Whitehall, shall be well rewarded.\r\n\r\nWhether the prince of pimps ever had to give the reward, we are not in a\r\nposition to state; we should, however, think that his advertisement\r\nattracted little attention, for we are now in the midst of the\r\nexcitement which led to the pretended plots and troubles that made every\r\nman suspect his neighbour, and when the cry of Recusant or Papist was\r\nalmost fatal to him against whom it was directed. That this feeling once\r\nroused was not to be subdued even in death, is shown by a notice in the\r\n_Domestick Intelligence_ of July 22, 1679:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS it was mentioned in the last “Intelligence” that Mr Langhorn\r\n  was buried in the Temple Church, there was a mistake in it, for it was\r\n  a Loyal Gentleman, one Colonel Acton, who was at that time buried by\r\n  his near relations there: And Mr Langhorn was buried that day in the\r\n  Churchyard of St Giles-in-the-Fields, very near the five Jesuits who\r\n  were executed last.\r\n\r\n  John Playford, Clerke to the Temple Church.\r\n\r\nHere is intolerance with a vengeance, but in the year 1679 reverence for\r\npersons or things was conspicuously absent, and this is best shown by\r\nthe advertisement which was issued for the purpose of discovering the\r\nruffians, or their patron, who committed the brutal assault upon John\r\nDryden. It appears in the _London Gazette_ of December 22, 1679:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS _John Dryden_, Esq., was on Monday, the 18th instant, at\r\n  night, barbarously assaulted and wounded, in Rose Street in Covent\r\n  Garden, by divers men unknown; if any person shall make discovery of\r\n  the said offenders to the said Mr Dryden, or to any Justice of the\r\n  Peace, he shall not only receive Fifty Pounds, which is deposited in\r\n  the hands of Mr Blanchard, Goldsmith, next door to Temple Bar, for the\r\n  said purpose, but if he be a principal or an accessory in the said\r\n  fact, his Majesty is graciously pleased to promise him his pardon for\r\n  the same.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the offer of this money, it was never discovered who\r\nwere the perpetrators, or who was the instigator of this cudgelling.\r\nSome fancy its promoter was Rochester, who was offended at some\r\nallusions to him in an “Essay on Satire,” written jointly by Dryden and\r\nLord Mulgrove; while others declare that the vanity of the Duchess of\r\nPortsmouth, one of the King’s many mistresses, having been offended by a\r\n_jeu d’esprit_ of the poet’s, she procured him a rough specimen of her\r\nfavours. Others, again, have suspected Buckingham, who was never on the\r\nbest of terms with Dryden, and who sat for the portrait drawn in Zimri\r\n(“Absalom and Achitophel”); but profligate and heartless libertine as\r\nVilliers was, he was above such a ruffianly reprisal. In the _Domestick\r\nIntelligence_ of December 23, 1679, the assault is thus described: “Upon\r\nthe 17th instant in the evening Mr Dryden the great poet, was set upon\r\nin Rose Street in Covent Garden, by three persons, who, calling him\r\nrogue, and son of a whore, knockt him down and dangerously wounded him,\r\nbut upon his crying out murther, they made their escape; it is conceived\r\nthat they had their pay beforehand, and designed not to rob him but to\r\nexecute on him some _Feminine_, if not _Popish_, vengeance.” In a\r\nsubsequent number of the same paper there is the following\r\nadvertisement:--\r\n\r\n  _WHEREAS there has been printed of late an Advertisement about the\r\n  Discovery of those who assaulted_ Mr Dryden, _with a promise of pardon\r\n  and reward to the Discoverer; For his further encouragement, this is\r\n  to give notice, that if the said Discoverer shall make known the\r\n  Person who incited them to that unlawful action, not only the\r\n  Discoverer himself but any of those who committed the fact, shall be\r\n  freed from all manner of prosecution_.\r\n\r\nAs a seasonable illustration we present an exact facsimile of a\r\nnewspaper containing reference to the attack. It is complete as it\r\nappears, being simply a single leaf printed back and front, and so the\r\nstories of men repeating a whole newspaper from memory are not so\r\nwonderful after all. This year (1679) is memorable among journalists as\r\nbeing the first which saw a rising press emancipated, a fact which is\r\nsufficiently interesting to be chronicled here, although our subject is\r\nnot newspapers, but only the advertisements contained in them.[27]\r\n\r\nDuring all this time it must not be supposed that the vendors of quack\r\nmedicines were at all idle. No political or religious disturbance was\r\never allowed to interfere with them, and their notices appeared as\r\nregularly as, or if possible more regularly than, ever. In a paper we\r\nhave not before met, the _Mercurius Anglicus_, date March 6-10, 1679-80,\r\nwe are introduced for the first time to the cordial which was destined\r\nto become so popular among nurses with whom neither the natural milk nor\r\nthat of human kindness was plentiful, viz., Daffy’s Elixir:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS divers Persons have lately exposed to sale a counterfeit drink\r\n  called ELIXIR SALUTIS, the true drink so called being first published\r\n  by Mr Anthony Daffy, who is the only person that rightly and truly\r\n  prepares it, he having experienced its virtues for above 20 years\r\n  past, by God’s blessing curing multitudes of people afflicted with\r\n  various distempers therewith, the receit whereof he never communicated\r\n  to any person living; and that these persons the better to colour\r\n  their deceit, have reported Mr Anthony Daffy to be dead, these are to\r\n  certify That the said Mr Anthony Daffy is still living and in good\r\n  health, at his house in Prujean court in the old Bailey, and that only\r\n  there and at such places as he has appointed in his printed sheets of\r\n  his Elixir’s virtues (which printed sheets are sealed with his seal)\r\n  the true ELIXIR SALUTIS or choice CORDIAL DRINK OF HEALTH is to be\r\n  sold.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that about this time people were never sure what year\r\nthey were in until March, and often during that month; and this is not\r\nonly so in the dates on newspapers, but is found in Pepys and other\r\nwriters of the period. Some journals do not give the double date as\r\nabove, for we have before us as we write two copies of the _Domestick\r\nIntelligence; or, News both from City and Country_, “Published to\r\nprevent false Reports,” No. 49 being dated “Tuesday, Decemb. 23, 1679;”\r\nand No. 52, “Friday, January 2, 1679.” This has not, as many people have\r\nimagined, anything to do with the difference between the New Calendar\r\nand the Old, as our alteration of style did not take place till the\r\nmiddle of the next century. It must have been a relic of the old\r\nEcclesiastical year which still affects the financial budget.\r\n\r\nThat the “agony column” of the present day is the result of slow and\r\nlaborious growth is shown by an advertisement, cut from a _Domestick\r\nIntelligence_ of March 1681, which contains an urgent appeal to one who\r\nhas in umbrage departed from home:--\r\n\r\n  ☞ WHEREAS a Person in London on some discontent did early on Monday\r\n  morning last retire from his dwelling-house and not yet return’d, it\r\n  is the earnest request of several of his particular friends, that the\r\n  said person would speedily repair to some or one of them, that he\r\n  thinks most fit; it being of absolute necessity, for reasons he does\r\n  not yet know off.\r\n\r\nAn advertisement of this kind, without name or initials, might now, like\r\nthe celebrated appeal to John Smith, apply itself to the minds of so\r\nmany who had left their families “on some discontent,” that there would\r\nbe quite a stampede for home among the married men making a temporary\r\nsojourn away from the domestic hearth and its attendant difficulties.\r\nMany of them would perhaps find themselves as unwelcome as unexpected.\r\n\r\nOur next selection will be interesting to those who are curious on the\r\nsubject of insurance, which must have been decidedly in its infancy on\r\nJuly 6, 1685, the day on which the following appeared in the _London\r\nGazette_:--\r\n\r\n  THERE having happened a Fire on the 24th of the last month by which\r\n  several houses of the friendly society were burned to the value of 965\r\n  pounds, these are to give notice to all persons of the said society\r\n  that they are desired to pay at the office Faulcon Court in Fleet\r\n  Street their several proportions of their said loss, which comes to\r\n  five shillings and one penny for every hundred pounds insured, before\r\n  the 12th of August next.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements are so far anything but plentiful, there being rarely\r\nmore than two or three at most beyond the booksellers’ and quack\r\nnotices; and although nowadays the columns of a newspaper are supposed\r\nto be unequalled for affording opportunities for letting houses and\r\napartments, the hereunder notice was, at the time of its publication in\r\nthe _London Gazette_, August 17, 1685, perfectly unique:--\r\n\r\n  THE EARL of BERKELEY’S HOUSE, with Garden and Stables, in St John’s\r\n  Lane, not far from Smith Field, is to be Let or Sold for Building.\r\n  Enquire of Mr Prestworth, a corn chandler, near the said house, and\r\n  you may know farther.\r\n\r\nAny one who passes through St John’s Lane now, with its squalid\r\ntenements, dirty shops, and half-starved population, will have to be\r\npossessed of a powerful imagination indeed to picture an earl’s\r\nresidence as ever standing in the dingy thoroughfare, notwithstanding\r\nthe neighbourhood has the advantage of a beautiful brand-new\r\nmeat-market, in place of the old cattle-pens which formerly stood on the\r\nopen space in front of Bartholomew’s Hospital. Yet as proof of the\r\naristocratic meetings which used to be held in St John’s Lane, the\r\nHospitallers’ Gate still crosses it--the gate which even after the days\r\nof chivalry had departed had still a history to make, not of bloodshed\r\nand warfare certainly, but of a connection with the highest and finest\r\ndescription of literature.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the year 1688, when advertising was more common than\r\nbefore, and when Charles having passed away, James held temporary\r\npossession of the throne. One, published in the _Gazette_ of March 8, is\r\nsuggestive of the religious tumult which would shortly end in his\r\ndownfall:--\r\n\r\n  CATHOLIC LOYALTY, ☞ upon the Subject of Government and Obedience,\r\n  delivered in a SERMON before the King and Queen, in His Majesties\r\n  Chapel at Whitehall, on the 13 of June 1687, by the Revnd. Father\r\n  Edward Scaraisbroke, priest of the Society of Jesus. Published by His\r\n  Majesty’s Command. Sold by Raydal Taylor near Stationers Hall, London.\r\n\r\nJust about this period dreadful outrages were of common occurrence; men\r\nwere knocked down in the street in open daylight, robbed, and murdered,\r\nand not a few deaths were the outcome of private and party hatred.\r\nMunicipal law was set at defiance, and any small body of desperadoes\r\ncould do as they liked unchecked, unless they happened to be\r\nprovidentially opposed by equal or superior force, when they generally\r\nturned tail, for their practice was not to fight so much as to beat and\r\nplunder the defenceless. Here is a notice which speaks volumes for the\r\nstate of affairs. It is published in the _London Gazette_, and bears\r\ndate March 29, 1688:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS a Gentleman was, on the eighteenth at night, mortally wounded\r\n  near Lincoln’s Inn, in Chancery Lane, in view as is supposed of the\r\n  coachman that set him down: these are to give notice that the said\r\n  coachman shall come in and declare his knowledge of the matter; if any\r\n  other person shall discover the said coachman to John Hawles, at his\r\n  chamber in Lincoln’s Inn, he shall have 5 guineas reward.\r\n\r\nAbout this time some show is made on behalf of those credulous folk who\r\nbelieve that all highwaymen in the good old times were brave, dashing,\r\nhighly educated, and extremely handsome; for we find several inquiries\r\nafter robbers who, before troubles came upon them, held superior\r\npositions in society. Here is one of the year 1688:--\r\n\r\n  _WHEREAS Mr Herbert Jones_, Attorney-at-Law in the Town of Monmouth,\r\n  well known by being several years together Under-Sheriff of the same\r\n  County, hath of late divers times robbed the Mail coming from that\r\n  town to London, and taken out divers letters and writs, and is now\r\n  fled from justice, and supposed to have sheltered himself in some of\r\n  the new-raised troops. These are to give notice that whosoever shall\r\n  secure the said Herbert Jones, so as to be committed in order to\r\n  answer these said crimes, may give notice thereof to Sir Thomas\r\n  Fowles, goldsmith, Temple-bar, London, or to Mr Michael Bohune,\r\n  mercer, in Monmouth, and shall have a guinea’s reward.\r\n\r\nMr Jones, culpable as he undoubtedly was, seems to have possessed a\r\nsense of honour, and probably he served his friends as well as himself\r\nby taking the writs from the mail. The reward offered for his\r\napprehension is so paltry in proportion to the outcry raised, that a\r\ndisinterested reader, _i.e._, one who has never felt the smart of\r\nhighway robbery, cannot help hoping that he got clear off, or that at\r\nall events he cheated the gallows by earning a soldier’s death “in some\r\nof the new-raised troops.” Although Mr Jones was a gentleman thief, and\r\nhad gentlemanly associates, he and his friends are the exceptions to the\r\nrule; for robbers generally are described as a very sad as well as a\r\nvery ugly lot of reprobates. Also in the same eventful year of delivery\r\nwe find the following, which appears in the _London Gazette_, the\r\nsubject of it having evidently thought to avail himself of the\r\ndisturbances of the time, but whether successfully or the reverse, does\r\nnot appear:--\r\n\r\n  RUN away from his master, Captain St Lo, the 21st instant, Obdelah\r\n  Ealias Abraham, a Moor, swarthy complexion, short frizzled hair, a\r\n  gold ring in his ear, in a black coat and blew breeches. He took with\r\n  him a blew Turkish watch-gown, a Turkish suit of clothing that he used\r\n  to wear about town, and several other things. Whoever brings him to Mr\r\n  Lozel’s house in Green Street shall have one guinea for his charges.\r\n\r\nThis advertisement is suggestive of the taste in blackamoors, which\r\nbegan to manifest itself about this time, and which had a long run--the\r\ncoloured creature who was in later times a negro, but in these a Moor,\r\nbeing often regarded as a mere soulless toy, a companion of the pug-dog,\r\nor an ornament to be classified with the vases and other china\r\nmonstrosities which were just then the vogue. The next advertisement we\r\nhave is of a very different character, and has a distinct bearing upon\r\nthe political question of the times; it also seems to show that the\r\nvalue of advertising was beginning to be still more understood, and that\r\nwith the advent of a new sovereign the attention of the commercial\r\nclasses was once more directed so much to business that even party\r\nfeeling was to be made a source of profit. The extract is from the _New\r\nObservator_ of July 17, 1689:--\r\n\r\n  ORANGE CARDS, representing the late King’s reign and expedition of the\r\n  Prince of Orange; viz. The Earl of Essex Murther, Dr Otes Whipping,\r\n  Defacing the Monument, My Lord Jeferies in the West hanging of\r\n  Protestants, Magdalen College, Trial of the Bishops, Castle Maine at\r\n  Rome, The Popish Midwife, A Jesuit Preaching against our Bible,\r\n  Consecrated Smock, My Lord Chancellor at the Bed’s feet, Birth of the\r\n  Prince of Wales, The Ordinare Mass-house pulling down and burning by\r\n  Captain Tom and his Mobile, Mortar pieces in the Tower, The Prince of\r\n  Orange Landing, The Jesuits Scampering, Father Peter’s Transactions,\r\n  The fight at Reading, The Army going over to the Prince of Orange,\r\n  Tyrconnel in Ireland, My Lord Chancellor in the Tower. With many other\r\n  remarkable passages of the Times. To which is added the efigies of our\r\n  Gracious K. William & Q. Mary, curiously illustrated and engraven in\r\n  lively figures, done by the performers of the first Popish Plot Cards.\r\n  Sold by Donnan Newman, the publisher and printer of the New\r\n  Observator.\r\n\r\nThis was a popular and rather practical method of celebrating the\r\ntriumph of the Whigs, and as Bishop Burnet was the editor of the _New\r\nObservator_, and these cards were sold by his publisher, he is very\r\nlikely to have had a hand in their promotion. About now the traffic in\r\nAfrican slaves commenced, and these full-blooded blacks gradually\r\ndisplaced the Moors and Arabs, who had formerly been the prevalent\r\ncoloured “fancy.” It is supposed that the taste for these dark-skinned\r\nservants was derived from the Venetians, whose intercourse with the\r\ntraders of India and Africa naturally led to their introduction. Moors\r\nare constantly being associated with the sea-girt Republic, both in\r\nliterature and art, Shakespeare’s “Moor of Venice” being somewhat of an\r\ninstance in point; while Titian and other painters of his school were\r\nextremely fond of portraying coloured men of all descriptions. By 1693,\r\nhowever, the negro had not altogether pushed out the Moor, if we may\r\njudge by an advertisement dated January 9-12, 1692-93, and appearing in\r\nthe _London Gazette_:--\r\n\r\n  THOMAS GOOSEBERRY, a blackamoor, aged about 24 years, a thin slender\r\n  man, middle stature, wears a periwig: Whoever brings him to Mr John\r\n  Martin at Guildhall Coffeehouse, shall have two guineas Reward.\r\n\r\nAnother advertisement, which appears in the same paper a couple of years\r\nlater, shows that the owners of these chattels considered their rights\r\nof property complete, as they put collars round their necks with names\r\nand addresses, just the same as they would have placed on a dog, or\r\nsimilar to that worn by “Gurth the thrall of Cedric.” This individual\r\nseems to have been different from any of the others we have met, as he\r\nis evidently a dusky Asiatic who has been purchased from his parents by\r\nsome adventurous trader, and whose thraldom sits heavily upon him. This\r\nis his description:--\r\n\r\n  A BLACK boy, an Indian, about thirteen years old, run away the 8th\r\n  instant from Putney, with a collar about his neck with this\r\n  inscription: ‘The Lady Bromfield’s black in Lincoln’s Inn Fields.’\r\n  Whoever brings him to Sir Edward Bromfield’s at Putney shall have a\r\n  guinea reward.\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly possible that a poor little wretch like this would have\r\nrun away--for whither could he run with any hope of securing his\r\nfreedom?--unless he had been unkindly treated. There is little\r\ndoubt--though we are, through the medium of the pictures of this and a\r\nlater time, in the habit of regarding the dark-faced, white-turbaned,\r\nand white-toothed slaves as personifications of that happiness which is\r\ndenied to higher intellects and fairer fortunes--that often they were\r\nthe victims of intense cruelty, and now and then of that worst of all\r\ndespotisms, the tyranny of an ill-natured and peevish woman.\r\n\r\nWe now come upon an advertisement, which shows something of the desire\r\nthat was always felt by residents in the country for the least\r\nscintillations of news; and the concoctor of the notice seems fully\r\naware of this desire, as well as possessed of a plan by means of which\r\nhe may make it a source of profit to himself. It occurs in a copy of the\r\n_Flying Post_ of the year 1694:--\r\n\r\n  IF any Gentleman has a mind to oblige his country friend or\r\n  correspondent, with an account of Public affairs he may have it for\r\n  twopence of J. Salusbury at the Rising Sun in Cornhill, on a sheet of\r\n  fine paper, half of which being blank, he may thereon write his own\r\n  private business or the material news of the day.\r\n\r\nBy this means the newspaper and the private letter were combined, and it\r\nis easy to understand the delight with which a gossiping and\r\nscandalising effusion, possessed of the additional advantage of being\r\nwritten on this kind of paper, was received at a lonely country house,\r\nby people pining after the gaieties of metropolitan life. The newsletter\r\nproper was a very ancient article of intercommunication, and it seems\r\nstrange that it should have flourished long after the introduction of\r\nnewspapers, which it certainly did. This may be accounted for by the\r\nfact, that during the time of the Rebellion it was much safer to write\r\nthan to print any news which was intended to be read at a distance, or\r\nwhich had any political significance. It has been remarked that many of\r\nthese newsletters “were written by strong partisans, and contained\r\ninformation which it was neither desirable nor safe that their opponents\r\nshould see. They were passed on from hand to hand in secret, and often\r\nindorsed by each successive reader. We are told that the Cavaliers, when\r\ntaken prisoners, have been known to eat their newsletters; and some of\r\nPrince Rupert’s, which had been intercepted, are still in existence, and\r\nbear dark red stains which testify to the desperate manner in which they\r\nwere defended. It is pretty certain, however, that as a profession\r\nnewsletter writing began to decline after the Revolution, though we find\r\nthe editor of the _Evening Post_, as late as the year 1709, reminding\r\nits readers that ‘there must be three or four pounds a year paid for\r\nwritten news.’ At the same time, the public journals, it is clear, had\r\nnot performed that part of their office which was really more acceptable\r\nto the country reader than any other--the retailing the political and\r\nsocial chit-chat of the day. We have only to look into the public papers\r\nto convince ourselves how woefully they fell short in a department which\r\nmust have been the staple of the newswriter.” It would seem, therefore,\r\nthat this effort of Mr Salusbury was to combine the old letter with the\r\nmodern paper, and thus at once oblige his customers and save a\r\ntime-honoured institution from passing away. It would seem as if he\r\nsucceeded, for there are in the British Museum many specimens of papers,\r\nhalf print half manuscript; and as most of the written portions are of\r\nan extremely treasonable nature, possibly the opportunity to send the\r\nkind of news which suited them best, and thus combine friendship and\r\nduty, was eagerly seized by the Jacobites. But how singular after all it\r\nseems for an editor to invite his subscribers to write their own news\r\nupon their own newspapers!\r\n\r\nWe are now getting very near the end of the seventeenth century, and\r\namong the curious and quaint advertisements which attract attention, as\r\nwe pore over the old chronicles which mark the close of the eventful\r\ncycle which has seen so much of revolution and disaster, and of the\r\nworst forms of religious and political fanaticisms carried to their most\r\ndreadful extremes, is the following. It appears in Salusbury’s _Flying\r\nPost_ of October 27, 1696, and gives a good idea of manners and customs,\r\nwhich do not so far appear to have altered for the better:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS six gentlemen (all of the same honourable profession), having\r\n  been more than ordinary put to it for a little pocket-money, did, on\r\n  the 14th instant, in the evening near Kentish town, borrow of two\r\n  persons (in a coach) a certain sum of money, without staying to give\r\n  bond for the repayment: And whereas fancy was taken to the hat,\r\n  peruke, cravate, sword and cane, of one of the creditors, which were\r\n  all lent as freely as the money: these are, therefore, to desire the\r\n  said six worthies, how fond soever they may be of the other loans, to\r\n  unfancy the cane again, and send it to Will’s Coffee-house, in\r\n  Scotland yard; it being too short for any such proper gentlemen as\r\n  they are, to walk with, and too small for any of their important uses\r\n  and withal, only valuable as having been the gift of a friend.\r\n\r\nAnd just about this time we come upon some more applications from our\r\nold friend Houghton, who seems to be doing a thriving business, and is\r\nas full of wants as even he could almost desire. In a number of his\r\n_Collection for the Improvement of Husbandry and Trade_ he expresses a\r\nwish as follows:--\r\n\r\n  ----I want an Englishman that can tolerably well speak French (if\r\n  Dutch too so much the better), and that will be content to sit at home\r\n  keeping accounts almost his whole time, and give good security for his\r\n  fidelity, and he shall have a pretty good salary.\r\n\r\nAnd again, his wishes being evidently for the perfection of servants,\r\neven to--which is rather an anomaly in domestic servitude--getting\r\nsecurity. Many servants must in those days have wished to get security\r\nfor the honesty of their masters:--\r\n\r\n  ----I want to wait on a gentleman in the City a young man that writes\r\n  a pretty good hand, and knows how to go to market, must wait on\r\n  company that comes to the house and wear a livery, has had the\r\n  small-pox, and can give some small security for his honesty.\r\n\r\nHoughton was noticeable for expressing a decided opinion with regard to\r\nthe quality of whatever he recommends, and, as we have shown, was not at\r\nall modest in his own desires. Even he, however, could rarely have\r\ndesigned such a bargain as this:--\r\n\r\n  ----One that is fit to keep a warehouse, be a steward or do anything\r\n  that can be supposed an intelligent man that has been a shopkeeper is\r\n  fit for, and can give any security that can be desired as far as ten\r\n  thousand pounds goes, and has some estate of his own, desires an\r\n  employment of one hundred pounds a year or upwards. I can give an\r\n  account of him.\r\n\r\nThis is the last we shall see of old Houghton, who did much good in his\r\ntime, not only for other people but for himself as well, and who may be\r\nfairly regarded as, if not the father, certainly one of the chief\r\npromoters of early advertising.\r\n\r\nThe next public notice we find upon our list is one which directs itself\r\nto all who may wish to be cured of madness, though why people who are\r\nreally and comfortably mad should wish to have the trouble of being\r\nsane, we do not profess to understand. However, it is not likely that\r\nthis gentleman helped them, for he overdoes it, and offers rather too\r\nmuch. The notice appears in the _Post Boy_ of January 6-9, 1699:--\r\n\r\n  IN Clerkenwell Close, where the figure of Mad People are over the\r\n  gate, Liveth one who by the Blessing of God, cureth all Lunitck\r\n  distracted or Mad People, he seldom exceeds 3 months in the cure of\r\n  the maddest Person that comes in his house, several have been cured in\r\n  a fortnight and some in less time; he has cured several from Bedlam\r\n  and other mad-houses in and about this City and has conveniency for\r\n  people of what quality soever. No cure no money. He likewise cureth\r\n  the dropsy infallibly and has taken away from 10, 12, 15, 20 gallons\r\n  of water with a gentle preparation. He cureth them that are 100 miles\r\n  off as well as them that are in town, and if any are desirous they may\r\n  have a note at his house of several that he hath cured.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the writer’s proficiency in the cure of lunatics, he\r\nseems to have been sorely exercised with regard to the spelling of the\r\nword, and he is ingenious enough in other respects. The remark about no\r\ncure no pay, it is noticeable, refers only to the cases of lunacy, and\r\nnot to those of dropsy, for the evident reason that it is quite possible\r\nto make a madman believe he is sane, while it would be rather hard to\r\nlead a dropsical person into the impression that he is healthy. Quacks\r\nswarm about this period, but as we shall devote special attention to\r\nthem anon, we will now step into the year 1700, beginning with the\r\n_Flying Post_ for January 6-9, which contains this, a notice of a\r\nregular physician of the time:--\r\n\r\n  AT the Angel and Crown in Basing-lane near Bow-lane liveth J. Pechey,\r\n  a Graduate in the University of Oxford, and of many years standing in\r\n  the College of Physicians in London: where all sick people that come\r\n  to him, may have for Six pence a faithful account of their diseases,\r\n  and plain directions for diet and other things they can prepare\r\n  themselves. And such as have occasion for Medicines may have them of\r\n  him at any reasonable rates, without paying anything for advice. And\r\n  he will visit any sick person in London or the Liberties thereof in\r\n  the day time for two shillings and Six pence, and anywhere else within\r\n  the Bills of Mortality for Five shillings. And if he be called in by\r\n  any person as he passes by in any of these places, he will require but\r\n  one shilling for his advice.\r\n\r\nThis is cheap enough, in all conscience, and yet there is little doubt\r\nthat the afflicted infinitely preferred the nostrums so speciously\r\nadvertised by empirics to treatment according to the pharmacopœia. We\r\nhave good authority for the statement that faith will move mountains,\r\nand it seems, if we are to judge by the testimonials published from\r\ntime immemorial by vendors of ointment and pills, to have moved\r\nmountainous tumours, wens, and carbuncles, for without it soft soap,\r\nbread, and bacon fat would be of little use indeed. Glorious John Dryden\r\ndied early in this year, and a hoaxing advertisement appeared in the\r\n_Post Boy_ of May 4-7, which called for elegies, &c.:--\r\n\r\n  THE Death of the famous John Dryden Esq. Poet Laureat to their two\r\n  late Majesties, King Charles and King James the Second; being a\r\n  Subject capable of employing the best pens, and several persons of\r\n  quality and others, having put a stop to his interment, which is to be\r\n  in Chaucer’s grave, in Westminster Abbey: This is to desire the\r\n  gentlemen of the two famous universities, and others who have a\r\n  respect for the memory of the deceas’d, and are inclinable to such\r\n  performances, to send what copies they please as Epigrams, etc. to\r\n  Henry Playford at his shop at the Temple-Change in Fleet street, and\r\n  they shall be inserted in a Collection which is design’d after the\r\n  same nature and in the same method (in what language they shall\r\n  please) as is usual in the composures which are printed on solemn\r\n  occasions at the two Universities aforesaid.\r\n\r\nOther advertisements followed this, and from them it appears that the\r\nshop of Henry Playford was inundated with manuscripts of all lengths and\r\nkinds, and in many languages. What became of them does not make itself\r\nknown, which is a pity, as many must have been equal to any specimen\r\nwhich occurs in the “Rejected Addresses,” with the advantage and\r\nrecommendation of being genuine.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that so far we have met with no theatrical or musical\r\nadvertisement or public notice of any forthcoming amusement, for it\r\nappeared most probable that as soon as ever advertising became at all\r\npopular it would have been devoted to the interest of all pursuits of\r\npleasure. In 1700, however, we come upon what must be considered the\r\nreally first advertisement issued from a playhouse, and, as a curiosity,\r\nreproduce it from the columns of the _Flying Post_ of July 4:--\r\n\r\n  ☞ AT the request and for the Entertainment of several persons of\r\n  quality at the _New Theatre in Lincolns-Inn-Fields_, to morrow, being\r\n  Friday the 5th of this instant, _July_, will be acted “The Comical\r\n  History of _Don Quixote_,” both parts made into one by the author.\r\n  With a new entry by the little boy, being his last time of dancing\r\n  before he goes to _France_: Also Mrs. _Elford’s_ new entry, never\r\n  performed but once and Miss _Evans’s_ jigg and _Irish_ dance: with\r\n  several new comical dances, composed and performed by Monsier _L’Sac_\r\n  and others. Together with a new Pastoral Dialogue, by Mr _Gorge_ and\r\n  Mrs _Haynes_, and variety of other singing. It being for the benefit\r\n  of a gentleman in great distress, and for the relief of his wife and 3\r\n  children.\r\n\r\nThis lead was soon followed by more important houses, and in a very few\r\nyears we have lists regularly published of the amusements at all\r\ntheatres. Theatrical managers have in all times been blessed with a\r\nstrong faculty of imitation, and though it seems immensely developed\r\njust now, the lessees of a hundred and seventy years ago were just as\r\nkeen to follow the scent of anything which had proved fortunate on the\r\nventure of any one possessed of pluck or originality.\r\n\r\nWe have reserved for the end of this chapter two advertisements of an\r\nindividual who, according to his own showing, would have been invaluable\r\nto some of the members of the various school boards of the present, and\r\nhave enabled them to keep pace with the pupils under their supervision,\r\na consummation devoutly to be wished. However, if we cannot have Mr\r\nSwitterda, some other _deus ex machinâ_ may yet arise. The first is from\r\nthe _Postman_ of July 6-9, and runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  ALL Gentlemen and Ladies who are desirous in a very short time to\r\n  learn to speak _Latin_, _French_ or _High Dutch_ fluently, and that\r\n  truly and properly without pedantry, according to Grammar rules, and\r\n  can but spare two hours a week, may faithfully be taught by Mr.\r\n  _Switterda_ or his assistant at his lodgings in _Panton Street_, at\r\n  the Bunch of Grapes, near _Leicester Fields_, where you may have Latin\r\n  and French historical cards. Children may come every day, or as often\r\n  as parents please at his house in _Arundel Street_, next to the\r\n  _Temple Passage_, chiefly those of discretion, who may be his or her\r\n  assistant, entring at the same time. And if any Gent. will take two\r\n  children or half a dozen of equal age, whose capacity are not\r\n  disproportionable, and let any Gent. take his choice, and leave to the\r\n  abovenamed S. the other, and he is content to lose his reward, if he\r\n  or his assistant makes not a greater and more visible improvement of\r\n  the Latin tongue in the first three months time, than any Gent.\r\n  whatsoever. Et quamquam nobili Germano est dedecori linguas profiteri,\r\n  tamen non abscondi talenta mea quæ Deus mihi largitus est, sed ea per\r\n  multos annos publicavi, et omnes tam divites quam paupores ad domum\r\n  meam invitavi, sed surdas semper aures pulsavi, multos mihi invidos\r\n  conciliavi, quos confidentia et sedulitate jam superavi. Omnes artes\r\n  mechanicæ quotidie excoluntur, artes vero liberales sunt veluti statua\r\n  idolatrica quæ addorantur non promoventur. He intends to dispose of\r\n  two copper plates containing the ground of the Latin tongue, and the\r\n  highest bidder shall have them. Every one is to pay according to his\r\n  quality from one guinea to 4 guineas _per_ month, but he will readier\r\n  agree by the great.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Mr Switterda was of an accommodating disposition, and\r\ndoubtless did well not only out of those who agreed by the great--a\r\nspecies of scholastic slang we are unable to understand positively,\r\nhowever much we may surmise--but out of those who were content, or were\r\nperforce compelled to put up, with the small. Here is another\r\n“high-falutin’” notice which appears in the same paper about a month\r\nlater, and which shows that the advertiser is also possessed of a power\r\nof puffing his own goods which must have aroused the envy and admiration\r\nof other quacks, in an age when they were not only numerous but\r\nsingularly fertile in expedient:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS in this degenerate age, Youth are kept so many years in\r\n  following only the _Latin_ tongue and many of them are quite\r\n  discouraged Mr. _Switterda_ offers a very easy, short, and delightful\r\n  method, which is full, plain, most expeditious and effectual, without\r\n  pedantry, resolving all into a laudable and most beneficial practice\r\n  by which Gent. and Ladies, who can but spare to be but twice in a week\r\n  with him, may in two years time learn _Latin_, _French_ and _High\r\n  Dutch_, not only to speak them truly and properly, but also to\r\n  understand a classical author. Antisthenes, an eminent Teacher being\r\n  ask’d why he had so few scholars? answer’d _Quoniam non compello, sed\r\n  depello illos virga argentea_. Mr. Switterda who loves _qualitatem non\r\n  quantitatem_ may say the same of a great many, except those who are\r\n  scholars themselves, and love to give their children extraordinary\r\n  learning, who have paid not only what he desired, but one, two, or\r\n  three guineas above their quarteridge, and some more than he asked. He\r\n  is not willing to be troubled with stubborn boys, or those of 8 or 9\r\n  years of age, unless they come along with one of more maturity, that\r\n  shall be able to instruct them at home, and such as may be serviceable\r\n  to the public in Divinity, Law and Physick, or teaching school. There\r\n  is £20 offered for the two copper plates, and he that bids most shall\r\n  have them. He teacheth Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at his house\r\n  in Arundel Street, next door above the Temple Passage, and the other\r\n  three days in Panton Street, at the Bunch of Grapes near Leicester\r\n  Fields, where you may have Latin and French Historical Cards, and a\r\n  pack to learn _Copia Verborum_, which is a great want in many\r\n  gentlemen. Every one is to pay according to his quality, from one\r\n  Guinea to 4 Guineas _per_ month. But poor Gent. and Ladies he will\r\n  consider, chiefly when they agree by the great, or come to board with\r\n  him.\r\n\r\nHow different from the puffing and pretentious announcements just given\r\nis the one of the same time which follows, as we read which we can hear\r\nthe hum of the little country schoolroom, and see the master with his\r\nwig all awry, deep in snuff and study, the mistress keenly alive to the\r\ndisposition of her girls, and the pupils of both sexes, as pupils are\r\noften even nowadays, intent upon anything but their lessons or work.\r\nLondon is forty miles away, and the coach is an object of wonder and\r\nadmiration to the villagers, who look upon the pupils who have come from\r\nthe great city with awe and reverence, while the master is supposed to\r\ndiffuse learning from every pore in his body, and to scatter knowledge\r\nwith every wave of his hand. The mistress is also an object of\r\nveneration, but her accomplishments are more within the ken of rustic\r\nfolk, and she, good simple dame, who imagines her husband to be the most\r\nlearned man in all the King, God bless him’s, dominions, delights to\r\ntalk about the clergymen they have educated, and has been the principal\r\ncause of his inditing and publishing this notice:--\r\n\r\n  ABOUT forty miles from London is a schoolmaster has had such success\r\n  with boys as there are almost forty ministers and schoolmasters that\r\n  were his scholars. His wife also teaches girls lacemaking, plain work,\r\n  raising paste, sauces, and cookery to a degree of exactness. His price\r\n  is £10 or £11 the year, with a pair of sheets and one spoon, to be\r\n  returned if desired; coaches and other conveniencies pass every day\r\n  within half a mile of the house, and ’tis but an easy journey to or\r\n  from London.\r\n\r\nAnd with these proofs that the schoolmaster was very much abroad at the\r\ntime, we will take leave of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n  [27] A nominal censorship was continued till 1695, but the freedom of\r\n  the press is considered by many to date from the year named above, and\r\n  an inspection of the papers themselves would seem to justify the\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n_EARLY PART OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now apparent that advertising has become recognised as a means of\r\ncommunication not only for the conveniencies of trade, but for\r\npolitical, lovemaking, fortune-hunting, swindling, and the thousand and\r\none other purposes which are always ready to assert themselves in a\r\nlarge community. It is also evident that as years have progressed,\r\nadvertising has become more and more necessary to certain trades, the\r\nprincipals in which a comparatively short time before would have scorned\r\nthe idea of ventilating their wares through the columns of the public\r\npress. So it is therefore as well to notice the rates which were charged\r\nby some of the papers. This was before the duty was placed upon\r\nadvertisements, when the arrangement was simply between one who wished a\r\nnotice inserted in a paper, and another who possessed the power of\r\nmaking such insertion. It is of course impossible to tell what the rates\r\nwere on all papers, but as some had notices of price per advertisement\r\nstated at foot, a fair estimate may be made. The first advertisements\r\nwere so few that no notice was called for, and it was not until every\r\nnewspaper looked forward to the possession of more or less that the plan\r\nof stating charges became common. About the period of which we are now\r\nwriting, long advertisements were unknown; they generally averaged about\r\neight lines of narrow measure, and were paid for at about a shilling\r\neach, with fluctuations similar in degree to those of the leading\r\npapers of the present day. Various rules obtained upon various papers.\r\nOne journal, the “_Jockey’s Intelligencer_, or Weekly Advertisements for\r\nHorses and Second-Hand Coaches to be Bought and Sold,” which appeared\r\ntowards the end of the seventeenth century, charged “a shilling for a\r\nhorse or coach for notification, and sixpence for renewing.” Still\r\nlater, the _County Gentleman’s Courant_ seems to have been the first\r\npaper to charge by the line, and in one of its numbers appears the\r\nfollowing rather non-sequitous statement: “Seeing promotion of trade is\r\na matter which ought to be encouraged, the price of advertisements is\r\nadvanced to twopence per line.” Very likely many agreed with the writer,\r\nwho seems to have had a follower several years afterwards--a corn\r\ndealer, who during a great dearth stuck up the following notification:\r\n“On account of the great distress in this town, the price of flour will\r\nbe raised one shilling per peck.” But neither of these men meant what he\r\nsaid, though doubtless he thought he did.\r\n\r\nThe first advertisement with which we open the century is of a\r\nsemi-religious character, and betrays a very inquiring disposition on\r\nthe part of the writer. Facts of the kind required are, however, too\r\nstubborn to meet with publication at the request of everybody, and if Mr\r\nKeith and other controversialists had been trammelled by them, there is\r\nevery probability that the inquiry we now republish would never have\r\nseen the light:--\r\n\r\n  ☞ WHEREAS the World has been told in public papers and otherwise of\r\n  numerous conversions of quakers to the Church of England, by means of\r\n  Mr Keith and others, and whereas the quakers give out in their late\r\n  books and otherwise, that since Mr Keith came out of America, there\r\n  are not ten persons owned by them that have left their Society, Mr\r\n  Keith and others will very much oblige the world in publishing a true\r\n  list of their proselytes.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is from the _Postman_ of March 1701, and in July the same\r\npaper contains a very different notice, which will give an idea of the\r\namusements then in vogue, and rescue from oblivion men whose names,\r\ngreat as they are in the advertisement, seem to have been passed over\r\nunduly by writers on ancient sports and pastimes, who seem to regard\r\nFigg and Broughton as the fathers of the backsword and the boxing\r\nmatch:--\r\n\r\n  A _Tryal of Skill_ to be performed at His Majesty’s Bear Garden in\r\n  Hockley-in-the-Hole, on Thursday next, being the 9th instant, betwixt\r\n  these following masters;--Edmund Button, master of the noble science\r\n  of defence, _who hath lately cut down_ Mr Hasgit and the Champion of\r\n  the West, _and 4 besides_, and James Harris, an Herefordshire man,\r\n  master of the noble science of defence, who has fought 98 prizes and\r\n  never was worsted, to exercise the usual weapons, at 2 o’clock in the\r\n  afternoon precisely.\r\n\r\nExhibitions of swordsmanship and cudgel-play were very frequent in the\r\nearly part of the eighteenth century, but ultimately pugilism, which at\r\nfirst was merely an auxiliary of the other sports, took the lead, most\r\nprobably through the invention of mufflers or gloves, first brought into\r\nnotice by Broughton, who was the most skilful boxer of his time. This\r\nwas, however, many years subsequent to the date of the foregoing.\r\n\r\nThe year 1702 is noticeable from the fact that in it was produced the\r\nfirst daily paper with which we have any acquaintance, and, unless the\r\ndoctrine that nothing is new under the sun holds good in this case, the\r\nfirst daily paper ever published. From it we take the following, which\r\nappears on December 1, and which seems--as no name or address is given,\r\nand as the advertiser does not even know the name of the gentleman, or\r\nanything about him beyond what is told in the advertisement--to have\r\nemanated from one of the stews which were even then pretty numerous in\r\nLondon:--\r\n\r\n  MISSED, on Sunday night, a large hanging coat of Irish frieze,\r\n  supposed to be taken away (thro’ mistake) by a gentleman in a fair\r\n  campaign wig and light-coloured clothes; if he will please to remember\r\n  where he took it, and bring it back again, it will be kindly received.\r\n\r\nWe should imagine that, unless both coats and gentlemen were more\r\nplentiful, in proportion to the population, in those days than they are\r\nnow, the rightful owner, who had probably also been a visitor at the\r\nestablishment, went without a garment which, judging by the date, must\r\nhave been peculiarly liable to excite cupidity. Nothing noticeable\r\noccurs for a long time, except the growth of raffle advertisements, and\r\nnotices of lotteries. These arrangements were called sales, though the\r\nonly things sold were most likely the confiding speculators. Everything\r\npossible was during this age put up to be raffled, though, with the\r\nexception of the variety of the items, which included eatables, wearing\r\napparel, houses, carriages and horses, &c. &c., there is nothing calling\r\nfor comment about the style of the notices. In the _Postman_ of July\r\n19-22, 1707, we at last come upon this, which is certainly peculiar from\r\nmore than one point of view:--\r\n\r\n  MR Benjamin Ferrers, Face-painter, the gentleman that can’t neither\r\n  speak nor hear, is removed from the Crown and Dagger at Charing Cross\r\n  into Chandois Street, next door to the sign of the Three Tuns in\r\n  Covent Garden.\r\n\r\nThis must have been one of the few cases in which physical disability\r\nbecomes a recommendation. Yet the process of whitening sepulchres must\r\nafter a time have become monotonous to even a deaf and dumb man. We\r\nsuppose the highest compliment that could have been paid to his work\r\nwas, that the ladies who were subjected to it looked “perfect pictures.”\r\nJust about this time the use of advertisements for the purposes of\r\ndeliberate puffery began to be discovered by the general trader, and in\r\nthe _Daily Courant_ of March 24, 1707, occurs a notice couched in the\r\nstyle of pure hyperbole, and emanating from the establishment of G.\r\nWilldey and T. Brandreth, at the sign of the Archimedes and Globe, on\r\nLudgate Hill, who advertised a microscope which magnified objects more\r\nthan two million times, and a concave metal that united the sunbeams so\r\nvigorously that in a minute’s time it melted steel and vitrified the\r\nhardest substance. “Also,” the notice went on to say, “we do protest we\r\npretend to no impossibilities, and that we scorn to impose on any\r\ngentleman or others, but what we make and sell shall be really good, and\r\nanswer the end we propose in our advertisements.” Spectacles by which\r\nobjects might be discovered at twenty or thirty miles’ distance,\r\n“modestly speaking,” are also mentioned; “and,” the ingenious opticians\r\nfinish off with, “we are now writing a small treatise with the aid of\r\nthe learned that gives the reasons why they do so, which will be given\r\ngratis to our customers.” This is an effort which would not have\r\ndisgraced the more mature puffers of following ages. But it aroused the\r\nanger and indignation of the former employers of Willdey and Brandreth,\r\nwho having duly considered the matter, on April 16 put forth, also in\r\nthe _Daily Courant_, an opposition statement, which ultimately led to a\r\nregular newspaper warfare:--\r\n\r\n  BY John Yarwell and Ralph Sterrop, Right Spectacles, reading and other\r\n  optic glasses, etc., were first brought to perfection by our own\r\n  proper art, and needed not the boasted industry of our two apprentices\r\n  to recommend them to the world; who by fraudently appropriating to\r\n  themselves what they never did, and obstinately pretending to what\r\n  they never can perform, can have no other end in view than to astonish\r\n  the ignorant, impose on the credulous, and amuse the public. For which\r\n  reason and at the request of several gentlemen already imposed on, as\r\n  also to prevent such further abuses as may arise from the repeated\r\n  advertisements of these two wonderful performers, we John Yarwell and\r\n  Ralph Sterrop do give public notice, that to any person who shall\r\n  think it worth his while to make the experiment, we will demonstrate\r\n  in a minute’s time the insufficiency of the instrument and the vanity\r\n  of the workmen by comparing their miraculous Two-Foot, with our Three\r\n  and Four Foot Telescopes. And therefore, till such a telescope be\r\n  made, as shall come up to the character of these unparalleled\r\n  performers, we must declare it to be a very impossible thing.\r\n\r\nThen the old-established and indignant masters proceed to recommend\r\ntheir own spectacles, perspectives, &c., in more moderate terms than\r\nwere employed by their late apprentices, but still in an extremely\r\nconfident manner. This appeared for several days, and at last, on April\r\n25, elicited the following reply:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS Mr Yarwell, Mr Sterrop, and Mr Marshall, the 2 first were our\r\n  Masters with whom we served our Apprenticeships, and since for several\r\n  years we have made the best of work for them and Mr Marshall. And now\r\n  they being envious at our prosperity have published several false,\r\n  deceitful and malicious advertisements, wherein they assert that we\r\n  cheat all that buy any of our goods, and that we pretend to many\r\n  impossibilities, and impose on the public, they having wrested the\r\n  words and sense of our advertisements, pretend that we affirm that a 2\r\n  Foot Telescope of our making will do as much as the best 4 Foot of\r\n  another man’s make, and they fraudulently show in their shops one of\r\n  their best 4 Foots against our small one, and then cry out against the\r\n  insufficiency of our instrument. Now we G. Willdey and Th. Brandreth\r\n  being notoriously abused, declare that we never did assert any such\r\n  thing, or ever did pretend to impossibilities, but will make good in\r\n  every particular all those [note, these are their own words]\r\n  (impossible, incredible, miraculous, wonderful, and astonishing)\r\n  things mentioned in our advertisements; which things perhaps may be\r\n  impossible, incredible, miraculous, wonderful, and astonishing to\r\n  them, but we assure them they are not so to us: For we have small\r\n  miraculous telescopes, as they are pleased to call them, that do such\r\n  wonders that they say it is impossible to make such, by the assistance\r\n  of which we will lay any person £10, that instead of 2 miles\r\n  mentioned, we will tell them the hour of the day 3 if not 4 miles by\r\n  such a dial as St James’s or Bow.\r\n\r\nAfter this the recalcitrant apprentices repeat all their former boasts,\r\nand conclude: “All these things are as they say impossible to them, but\r\nare and will be made by G. Willdey and T. Brandreth.... Let ingenuity\r\nthrive.” Willdey and Brandreth now, no doubt, thought that they had\r\nturned the tables upon their former masters, and had all the best of the\r\nbattle; but the duel was not yet over, as the second time this\r\nadvertisement appeared (_Daily Courant_, April 26), the following was\r\nimmediately under it:--\r\n\r\n  A CONFIDENT Mountebank by the help of his bragging speech passes upon\r\n  the ignorant as a profound doctor, the commonest medicines and the\r\n  easiest operations in such an one’s hand, shall be cried up as\r\n  miracles. But there are mountebanks in other arts as well as in\r\n  physick: Glasgrinding it seems is not free from ’em, as it is seen in\r\n  the vain boastings of Willdey and Brandreth. ’Tis well known to all\r\n  gentlemen that have had occasion to use optic glasses that J. Yarwell\r\n  was the true improver of that art, and has deservedly a name for it,\r\n  in all parts abroad as well as at home. He and R. Sterrop, who lives\r\n  in the old shop in Ludgate Street, have always and do now make as true\r\n  and good works of all kinds in that art as any man can do. And we are\r\n  so far from discouraging any improvement, that we gladly receive from\r\n  any hand, and will be at any expence to put in practice an invention\r\n  really advantageous in the art. But Willdey’s performances are so far\r\n  from improvements that we are ready to oppose any of our work to his\r\n  and stake any wager upon the judgment of a skilful man. And because he\r\n  talks so particularly of his two foot telescope, to let the world see\r\n  that there is nothing in that vaunt, we will stake 10 Guineas upon a\r\n  two-foot telescope of ours against the same of his. And further to\r\n  take away all pretensions of our preparing one on purpose, if any\r\n  gentleman that has a two-foot telescope bought of us within a year\r\n  past, and not injured in the use, will produce it, we will lay 5\r\n  Guineas upon its performance against one of theirs of the same date.\r\n  This is bringing the matter upon the square, and will, we hope,\r\n  satisfy the world that we are not worse workmen than those we taught.\r\n\r\nAgain the young men ventured into print (May 1, 1707), to reply, and to\r\ndefend what they were pleased to call the naked truth, “against the\r\napparent malicious lies and abuse” of their former employers, in whose\r\nlast advertisement they pointed out some inconsistencies, claimed the\r\ninvention of the perfected spectacles as theirs, and ended in offering\r\nto bet “20 guineas to their 10, that neither they nor Mr Marshall can\r\nmake a better telescope than we can.” This, though rather a descent from\r\nthe high horse previously occupied by them, was sufficient to rouse the\r\nanger of an interested yet hitherto passive spectator, and Mr Marshall\r\npresently (May 8) indignantly growled forth:--\r\n\r\n  THE best method now used for Grinding Spectacles and other glasses,\r\n  was by me at great charge and pains found out, which I shewed to the\r\n  Royal Society in the year 1693, and by them approved; being gentlemen\r\n  the best skilled in optics, for which they gave me their certificate\r\n  to let the world know what I had done. Since which I have made\r\n  spectacles, telescopes, and microscopes, for all the Kings and\r\n  Prince’s Courts in Europe. And as for the 2 new spectacle makers, that\r\n  would insinuate to the world that they were my best workmen for\r\n  several years: the one I never employed, the other I found as I doubt\r\n  not but many gentlemen have and will find them both, to be only\r\n  boasters and not performers of what they advertise, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nAfter pursuing this strain till he had run down, Mr Marshall concludes\r\nby saying, “What I have inserted is nothing but truth.” At the same time\r\nYarwell and Sterrop overwhelmed the raisers of this hornets’ nest with a\r\nnew attention, in which among other things was the following:--\r\n\r\n  Mr Willdey and Brandreth have the folly to believe that abundance of\r\n  words is sufficient to gain applause, and therefore throw ’em out\r\n  without regard to truth and reason, but as that is an affront to the\r\n  understanding of gentlemen that use the goods they sell, they being\r\n  persons of discerning judgment, there needs no other answer to what\r\n  they have published than to compare one part with another. They set\r\n  forth with a lying vaunt that their two-foot telescope would perform\r\n  the same that a common four-foot one would do, and when ’twas replied\r\n  that was false, and a four-foot one offered to try, they poorly shift\r\n  off with crying “That’s one of your best four-foot ones.” Now we\r\n  profess to make none but best, the glasses of every one being true\r\n  ground and rightly adjusted, and the difference in price arrises only\r\n  from the goodness, ornaments, and convenience of the case, neither can\r\n  he produce a four-foot one of anybody’s make, that does not far exceed\r\n  his two-foot, nor does his two-foot one at all exceed ours, which they\r\n  don’t now pretend. And therefore the lie is all on his side, and the\r\n  impossibility in his pretensions is as strong as ever, and what we\r\n  have said is just truth, and his foul language no better than\r\n  Billingsgate railing. But it seems because we do not treat him in his\r\n  own way and decry his goods as much as he does other men’s, he has the\r\n  folly to construct it as an acknowledgement that his excel. But we are\r\n  so far from allowing that, that we do aver they have nothing to brag\r\n  of but what they learnt of us, and Brandreth was so indifferent a\r\n  workman that Marshall, who had taken him for a journeyman, was fain to\r\n  turn him off. The secrets they brag of is all a falsehood, and the\r\n  microscope the same that any one may have from Culpeper who is the\r\n  maker. We have already told the world that we will venture any wager\r\n  upon the performance of our two foot telescope against theirs, and we\r\n  would be glad to have it taken up that we might have the opportunity\r\n  of showing that ours exceeds, and letting the world see that his brags\r\n  are only such as mountebanks make in medicine.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the _Daily Courant_ for May 12, 1707, Willdey and Brandreth\r\nonce again insert their vaunt, and then proceed to demolish their late\r\nemployers thus:--\r\n\r\n  We do affirm it [the telescope made by W. & B.] to be the pleasantest\r\n  and usefullest instrument of this kind, and what our adversaries have\r\n  said against it is false and proceeds from an ill design; we have\r\n  already offered to lay them 20 guineas to their 10 that they could not\r\n  make a better, but they knowing they were not capable to engage us in\r\n  that particular, said in their answer that there needs no more than to\r\n  compare one instrument with another that they may have the opportunity\r\n  of shewing that theirs exceeds; to which proposal we do agree, and to\r\n  that purpose have bought 3 of their best telescopes that we might be\r\n  sure of one that was good, though they say in their advertisements\r\n  that they make none but the best, and we are ready to give our oaths\r\n  that no damage has been done them since they were bought. And now to\r\n  bring these matters to an end, we will lay them 20 guineas to their\r\n  10, that 3 of our best of the same sizes are better than them; and any\r\n  gentleman that will may see the experiment tried in an instant at our\r\n  shop, where they may also see that our best pocket telescope comes not\r\n  far short of their best large 4 Foot one. And several other\r\n  curiosities all made to the greatest perfection. And whereas Mr\r\n  Yarwell, Mr Sterrop, and Mr Marshall have maliciously, falsly, and\r\n  unjustly insinuated that we are but indifferent workmen, several\r\n  persons being justly moved by that scandalous aspersion, have offered\r\n  to give their oaths that they have often heard them say that we were\r\n  the best of workmen, and that we understood our business as well as\r\n  themselves. And as such we do each of us challenge them all 3\r\n  severally to work with them, who does most and best for £20. As for\r\n  the Microscope it is our own invention, and 2 of them were made by us\r\n  before any person saw them, as we can prove by witnesses; as we also\r\n  can their railing and scandalous aspersions to be false. All persons\r\n  may be assured that all our instruments do and will answer the\r\n  character given them in the advertisements of T. Brandreth and G.\r\n  Willdey, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nWhether the game was too expensive, or whether the old firm was shut up\r\nby this, we know not, but anyhow they retired from the contest, and it\r\nis to be hoped found that rivalry fosters rather than injures business.\r\nWe have given particular attention to this conflict of statements, as it\r\nshows how soon advertisements, after they had become general, were used\r\nfor aggressional and objectionable trade purposes. Passing on for a\r\nlittle space, until 1709, the _Tatler_ appears on the scene, and\r\ncommences with a full share of advertisements, and very soon one is\r\nfound worthy of quotation. This appears on March 21, and is a form of\r\napplication which soon found favour with the gallants and ladies of\r\npleasure of the day:--\r\n\r\n  A GENTLEMAN who, the twentieth instant, had the honour to conduct a\r\n  lady out of a boat at Whitehall Stairs, desires to know when he may\r\n  wait on her to disclose a matter of concern. A letter directed to Mr\r\n  Samuel Reeves, to be left with Mr May, at the Golden Head, the upper\r\n  end of New Southampton Street, Covent Garden.\r\n\r\nThere are about this time many instances appearing in the notice columns\r\nof what has been called love at first sight, though from the fact that\r\nadvertisements had to bring their influence to bear on the passion, it\r\nlooks as though the impression took some time to fix itself. Otherwise\r\nthe declaration might have been made at once, unless, indeed, timidity\r\nprevented it. Perhaps, too, the occasional presence of a gentleman\r\ncompanion might have deterred these inflammable youths from prosecuting\r\ntheir suits and persecuting the objects of their temporary adoration.\r\nJust after the foregoing we come upon a slave advertisement couched in\r\nthe following terms:--\r\n\r\n  A BLACK boy, twelve years of age, fit to wait on a gentleman, to be\r\n  disposed of at Denis’s Coffee house in Finch Lane, near the Royal\r\n  Exchange.\r\n\r\nThere is no mincing the matter about this, and as, at the same time, a\r\nvery extensive traffic was carried on in “white flesh” for the\r\nplantations, the advertiser would doubtless have regarded sympathy with\r\nhis property as not only idiotic but offensive. And then we light on\r\nwhat must be regarded as an advertisement, though it emanates from the\r\neditorial sanctum, and is redolent of that humour which, first\r\nidentified with the _Tatler_, has never yet been surpassed, and, as many\r\nstill say, never equalled:--\r\n\r\n  ANY ladies who have any particular stories of their acquaintance which\r\n  they are willing privately to make public, may send ’em by the penny\r\n  post to Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq., enclosed to Mr John Morpheu, near\r\n  Stationers’ Hall.\r\n\r\nWhat a chance for the lovers of scandal, and doubtless they readily\r\navailed themselves of it. Many a hearty laugh must Steele have had over\r\nthe communications received, and many of them must have afforded him the\r\ngroundwork for satires, which at the time must have struck home indeed.\r\nIn the following year “Isaac Bickerstaff, Esquire,” seems to have taken\r\nit into his head that John Partridge, the astrologer, ought to be dead,\r\nif he really was not, and so inserted a series of advertisements to the\r\neffect that that worthy had really departed this life, which, however\r\namusing to the _Tatler_ folk and the public, seem to have nearly driven\r\nthe stargazer wild.[28] One of the best of this series, which appears on\r\nAugust 10, 1710, runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS an ignorant Upstart in Astrology has publicly endeavoured to\r\n  persuade the world that he is the late John Partridge, who died the 28\r\n  of March 1718, these are to certify all whom it may concern, that the\r\n  true John Partridge was not only dead at that time but continues so to\r\n  the present day. Beware of counterfeits, for such are abroad.\r\n\r\nThe quiet yet pungent drollery of this is almost irresistible, but it\r\nhas the effect of making us rather chary of accepting any of the\r\nremaining advertisements which look at all like emanations from the\r\nquaint fancy of the editor. Take the following, for instance, which is\r\nfound among a number of others of an ordinary character, undistinguished\r\nfrom them by any peculiarity of type or position. It seems, however, to\r\nbetray its origin:--\r\n\r\n  _The Charitable Advice Office_, where all persons may have the opinion\r\n  of dignified Clergymen, learned Council, Graduate Physicians, and\r\n  experienced Surgeons, to any question in Divinity, Morality, Law,\r\n  Physic, or Surgery, with proper Prescriptions within twelve hours\r\n  after they have delivered in a state of their case. Those who can’t\r\n  write may have their cases stated at the office. * * The fees are only\r\n  1_s._ at delivery or sending your case, and 1_s._ more on\r\n  re-delivering that and the opinion upon it, being what is thought\r\n  sufficient to defray the necessary expense of servants and\r\n  office-rent.\r\n\r\nThe theory of advertising must about this time have been found\r\nconsiderably interesting to men who were unlikely to participate in its\r\nbenefits unless it were through the increased prosperity of the\r\nnewspapers to which they contributed, for essays and letters on the\r\nsubject, some humorous and others serious, appear quite frequently. Most\r\nnoticeable among the former is an article from the pen of Addison, which\r\nappears in No. 224 of the _Tatler_, date September 14, 1710. It will\r\nspeak better for itself than we can speak for it:--\r\n\r\n  “_Materiem superabat opus._--OVID. MET. ii. 5.\r\n\r\n  “The matter equall’d not the artist’s skill.--R. WYNNE.\r\n\r\n“It is my custom, in a dearth of news, to entertain myself with those\r\ncollections of advertisements that appear at the end of our public\r\nprints. These I consider as accounts of news from the little world, in\r\nthe same manner that the foregoing parts of the paper are from the\r\ngreat. If in one we hear that a sovereign prince is fled from his\r\ncapital city, in the other we hear of a tradesman who has shut up his\r\nshop and run away. If in one we find the victory of a general, in the\r\nother we see the desertion of a private soldier. I must confess I have a\r\ncertain weakness in my temper that is often very much affected by these\r\nlittle domestic occurrences, and have frequently been caught with tears\r\nin my eyes over a melancholy advertisement.\r\n\r\n“But to consider this subject in its most ridiculous lights,\r\nadvertisements are of great use to the vulgar. First of all as they are\r\ninstruments of ambition. A man that is by no means big enough for the\r\nGazette, may easily creep into the advertisements; by which means we\r\noften see an apothecary in the same paper of news with a\r\nplenipotentiary, or a running footman with an ambassador. An\r\nadvertisement from Piccadilly goes down to posterity with an article\r\nfrom Madrid, and John Bartlett[29] of Goodman’s Fields is celebrated in\r\nthe same paper with the Emperor of Germany. Thus the fable tells us,\r\nthat the wren mounted as high as the eagle, by getting upon his back.\r\n\r\n“A second use which this sort of writings have been turned to of late\r\nyears has been the management of controversy, insomuch that above half\r\nthe advertisements one meets with nowadays are purely polemical. The\r\ninventors of ‘Strops for Razors’ have written against one another this\r\nway for several years, and that with great bitterness;[30] as the whole\r\nargument _pro_ and _con_ in the case of the ‘Morning Gown’ is still\r\ncarried on after the same manner. I need not mention the several\r\nproprietors of Dr Anderson’s pills; nor take notice of the many\r\nsatirical works of this nature so frequently published by Dr Clark, who\r\nhas had the confidence to advertise upon that learned knight, my very\r\nworthy friend, Sir William Read:[31] but I shall not interpose in their\r\nquarrel: Sir William can give him his own in advertisements, that, in\r\nthe judgment of the impartial, are as well penned as the Doctor’s.\r\n\r\n“The third and last use of these writings is to inform the world where\r\nthey may be furnished with almost every thing that is necessary for\r\nlife. If a man has pains in his head, colics in his bowels, or spots in\r\nhis clothes, he may here meet with proper cures and remedies. If a man\r\nwould recover a wife or a horse that is stolen or strayed; if he wants\r\nnew sermons, electuaries, asses’ milk, or anything else, either for his\r\nbody or mind, this is the place to look for them in.\r\n\r\n“The great art in writing advertisements, is the finding out a proper\r\nmethod to catch the reader’s eye, without which a good thing may pass\r\nunobserved, or be lost among commissions of bankrupt. Asterisks and\r\nhands were formerly of great use for this purpose. Of late years the\r\nN.B. has been much in fashion, as also little cuts and figures, the\r\ninvention of which we must ascribe to the author of spring-trusses. I\r\nmust not here omit the blind Italian character, which being scarce\r\nlegible, always fixes and detains the eye, and gives the curious reader\r\nsomething like the satisfaction of prying into a secret.\r\n\r\n“But the great skill in an advertiser is chiefly seen in the style which\r\nhe makes use of. He is to mention the ‘universal esteem,’ or ‘general\r\nreputation’ of things that were never heard of. If he is a physician or\r\nastrologer, he must change his lodgings frequently; and though he never\r\nsaw anybody in them besides his own family, give public notice of it,\r\n‘for the information of the nobility and gentry.’ Since I am thus\r\nusefully employed in writing criticisms on the works of these diminutive\r\nauthors, I must not pass over in silence an advertisement, which has\r\nlately made its appearance and is written altogether in a Ciceronian\r\nmanner. It was sent to me with five shillings, to be inserted among my\r\nadvertisements; but as it is a pattern of good writing in this way, I\r\nshall give it a place in the body of my paper.\r\n\r\n  “The highest compounded Spirit of Lavender, the most glorious, if the\r\n  expression may be used, enlivening scent and flavour that can possibly\r\n  be, which so raptures the spirits, delights the gusts, and gives such\r\n  airs to the countenance, as are not to be imagined but by those that\r\n  have tried it. The meanest sort of the thing is admired by most\r\n  gentlemen and ladies; but this far more, as by far it exceeds it, to\r\n  the gaining among all a more than common esteem. It is sold in neat\r\n  flint bottles, fit for the pocket, only at the Golden Key in Wharton’s\r\n  Court, near Holborn Bars, for three shillings and sixpence, with\r\n  directions.\r\n\r\n“At the same time that I recommend the several flowers in which this\r\nspirit of lavender is wrapped up, if the expression may be used, I\r\ncannot excuse my fellow-labourers for admitting into their papers\r\nseveral uncleanly advertisements, not at all proper to appear in the\r\nworks of polite writers. Among them I must reckon the ‘Carminative\r\nWind-Expelling Pills.’ If the Doctor had called them ‘Carminative\r\nPills,’ he had been as cleanly as any one could have wished; but the\r\nsecond word entirely destroys the decency of the first. There are other\r\nabsurdities of this nature so very gross, that I dare not mention them;\r\nand shall therefore dismiss this subject with an admonition to Michael\r\nParrot, that he do not presume any more to mention a certain worm he\r\nknows of, which, by the way, has grown seven foot in my memory; for, if\r\nI am not much mistaken, it is the same that was but nine feet long about\r\nsix months ago.\r\n\r\n“By the remarks I have here made, it plainly appears, that a collection\r\nof advertisements is a kind of miscellany; the writers of which,\r\ncontrary to all authors, except men of quality, give money to the\r\nbooksellers who publish their copies. The genius of the bookseller is\r\nchiefly shown in his method of ranging and digesting these little\r\ntracts. The last paper I took up in my hands places them in the\r\nfollowing order:--\r\n\r\n“The true Spanish blacking for shoes, etc.\r\n\r\n“The beautifying cream for the face, etc.\r\n\r\n“Pease and Plasters, etc.\r\n\r\n“Nectar and Ambrosia, etc.\r\n\r\n“Four freehold tenements of fifteen pounds per annum, etc.\r\n\r\n“The present state of England, etc.\r\n\r\n“Annotations upon the _Tatler_, etc.\r\n\r\n“A commission of Bankrupt being awarded against R. L., bookseller, etc.”\r\n\r\nThis essay probably aroused a good deal of attention, and among the\r\nletters of correspondents is one from a “Self-interested Solicitor,”\r\nwhich appears in No. 228, and runs thus:--\r\n\r\n“_Mr Bickerstaff._\r\n\r\n“I am going to set up for a scrivener, and have thought of a project\r\nwhich may turn both to your account and mine. It came into my head upon\r\nreading that learned and useful paper of yours concerning\r\nadvertisements. You must understand I have made myself Master in the\r\nwhole art of advertising, both as to the style and the letter. Now if\r\nyou and I could so manage it, that nobody should write advertisements\r\nbesides myself, or print them anywhere but in your paper, we might both\r\nof us get estates in a little time. For this end I would likewise\r\npropose that you should enlarge the design of advertisements, and have\r\nsent you two or three samples of my work in this kind, which I have made\r\nfor particular friends, and intend to open shop with. The first is for a\r\ngentleman who would willingly marry, if he could find a wife to his\r\nliking; the second is for a poor Whig, who is lately turned out of his\r\npost; and the third for a person of a contrary party, who is willing to\r\nget into one.\r\n\r\n“Whereas A. B. next door to the Pestle and Mortar, being about thirty\r\nyears old, of a spare make, with dark-coloured hair, bright eye, and a\r\nlong nose, has occasion for a good-humoured, tall, fair, young woman, of\r\nabout £3000 fortune; these are to give notice That if any such young\r\nwoman has a mind to dispose of herself in marriage to such a person as\r\nthe above mentioned, she may be provided with a husband, a coach and\r\nhorses and a proportionable settlement.\r\n\r\n“C. D. designing to quit his place, has great quantities of paper,\r\nparchment, ink, wax, and wafers to dispose of, which will be sold at\r\nvery reasonable rates.\r\n\r\n“E. F. a person of good behaviour, six foot high, of a black complexion\r\nand sound principles, wants an employ. He is an excellent penman and\r\naccomptant, and speaks French.”\r\n\r\nAnd so on, advertisements being then considered proper sport for wits of\r\nall sizes and every peculiarity. In 1711 we come upon the first edition\r\nof the _Spectator_, which certainly did not disdain to become a medium\r\nfor most barefaced quacks, if we may judge by this:--\r\n\r\n  AN admirable confect which assuredly cures Stuttering and Stammering\r\n  in children or grown persons, though never so bad, causing them to\r\n  speak distinct and free without any trouble or difficulty; it remedies\r\n  all manner of impediments in the speech or disorders of the voice of\r\n  any kind, proceeding from what cause soever, rendering those persons\r\n  capable of speaking easily and free, and with a clear voice who before\r\n  were not able to utter a sentence without hesitation. Its stupendous\r\n  effects in so quickly and infallibly curing Stammering and all\r\n  disorders of the voice and difficulty in delivery of the speech are\r\n  really wonderful. Price 2s. 6d. a pot, with directions. Sold only at\r\n  Mr Osborn’s Toyshop, at the Rose and Crown, under St Dunstan’s church\r\n  Fleet street.\r\n\r\nThis is a truly marvellous plan for greasing the tongue. The only wonder\r\nis that the advertiser did not recommend it as invaluable to public\r\nspeakers for increasing the fluency to such an extent that the orator\r\nhad but to open his mouth and let his tongue do as it willed. And\r\ncertainly the most rebellious and self-willed tongue could hardly give\r\nutterance to more remarkable statements, if left entirely to itself,\r\nthan appears in the following, which is also from the original edition\r\nof the _Spectator_:--\r\n\r\n  LOSS of Memory, or Forgetfulness, certainly cured by a grateful\r\n  electuary peculiarly adapted for that end; it strikes at the primary\r\n  source, which few apprehend, of forgetfulness, makes the head clear\r\n  and easy, the spirits free, active, and undisturbed, corroborates and\r\n  revives all the noble faculties of the soul, such as thought,\r\n  judgment, apprehension, reason and memory, which last in particular it\r\n  so strengthens as to render that faculty exceeding quick and good\r\n  beyond imagination; thereby enabling those whose memory was before\r\n  almost totally lost, to remember the minutest circumstances of their\r\n  affairs, etc. to a wonder. Price 2s. 6d. a pot. Sold only at Mr\r\n  Payne’s, at the Angel and Crown, in St Paul’s Churchyard, with\r\n  directions.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes possible to remember too much; and if the specific sold\r\nby Mr Payne had but a homœopathic tendency, and caused those who\r\nrecollected things which never happened to become cured of their\r\npropensities, it is a pity its recipe has to be numbered among the lost\r\nthings of this world. In the beginning of 1712, one Ephraim How seems to\r\nhave been possessed of a fear that evil folks had been trying to injure\r\nhim or his business, or else he felt it incumbent on himself to take the\r\nhint thrown out in the _Tatler_ essay. Accordingly he published in the\r\n_Daily Courant_ the following:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS several persons who sell knives, for the better vending their\r\n  bad wares spread reports that Ephraim How, Cutler of London is\r\n  deceased. This is to certify That he is living, and keeps his business\r\n  as formerly, with his son in partnership, at the Heart and Crown on\r\n  Saffron Hill; there being divers imitations, you are desired to\r\n  observe the mark, which is the Heart Crown and Dagger, with How under\r\n  it.\r\n\r\nAbout this period shopkeepers were or pretended to be particularly\r\nloyal, for a very large percentage of their signs contained the emblem\r\nof royalty, coupled with various other figures. Though the Methuen\r\ntreaty, which favoured the importation of Portuguese wines, and\r\ndiscouraged the use of claret, was signed in 1703, it does not appear to\r\nhave made much difference in this country for some years, as the first\r\nmention we find of the new wine is in a _Postboy_ of January 1712, and\r\nis caused by the rivalry which sprang up among those who first began to\r\nsell it:--\r\n\r\n  NOTICE is hereby given, That Messieurs Trubey, at the Queen’s Arms\r\n  Tavern, the West End of St Paul’s Church, have bought of Sir John\r\n  Houblon, 76 pipes of _New_ natural Oporto Wines, red and white,\r\n  perfect neat, and shall remain genuine, chosen out of 96 pipes, and\r\n  did not buy the cast-outs. Also they have bought of other merchants\r\n  large quantities of _new_ natural Oporto wines, with great choice (by\r\n  the last fleet). And altho’ the aforesaid did buy of Messieurs Brook\r\n  and Hellier, _new_ natural Oporto wines of the earliest importation,\r\n  which they have yet by them; and ’tis not only their own opinion, that\r\n  the said Sir John Houblon’s and other merchant’s Oporto wines, which\r\n  they have bought are superior, and do give us more general\r\n  satisfaction: for the same is daily confirm’d by gentlemen and others\r\n  of undoubted judgment and credit. Further this assertion deserves\r\n  regard, viz. That the said Messieurs Brook and Helliers have bought of\r\n  several merchants entire parcels of Oporto and Viana wines, red and\r\n  white, good and bad, thereby continuing retailing, under the specious\r\n  and fallacious pretences of natural red and neat of their own\r\n  importing.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--The intentions of the above-named Vintners are not any way to\r\n  reproach or diminish the reputation of their brethren, nor insinuate\r\n  to their detriment, sympathizing with them. Note the aforesaid _new_\r\n  natural Oporto wines, are to be sold by the aforesaid vintners at £16\r\n  per hogshead, at 18d. per quart, without doors, and at 20d. per quart,\r\n  within their own houses.\r\n\r\nBrook & Hellier, whose wine is spoken of so slightingly, kept the Bumper\r\nTavern in Covent Garden, which had formerly belonged to Dick Estcourt.\r\nThey seem quite able to bear what has been said of them, for they have\r\nthe _Spectator_, who has evidently tasted, and quite as evidently liked\r\ntheir wines, at their back, one of the numbers of this disinterested\r\nperiodical being devoted almost entirely to their praise. The\r\n_Spectator_ was by no means averse to a bit of good genuine puffery, and\r\nPeter Motteux, formerly an author who had dedicated a poem or two to\r\nSteele, and who at that time kept one of the Indian warehouses so much\r\nin fashion, received kindnesses in its columns more than once. So did\r\nRenatus Harris the organ-builder, who competed with Smith for the Temple\r\norgan, and many others. So it is not extraordinary that their\r\nadvertisement is found in the _Spectator_ very shortly after that just\r\nquoted. They seem, however, to have been disinclined to quarrel, as\r\ntheir notice makes no mention of their rivals:--\r\n\r\n  BROOK and Hellier, &c. having discovered that several gentlemen’s\r\n  servants who have been sent to their taverns and cellars for neat\r\n  Oporto wines (which is 18d. per quart) have instead thereof bought the\r\n  small Viana, which is but 15d. a quart; and that some who have been\r\n  sent directly to the above taverns and cellars have never come there,\r\n  but carried home (like traitors) something else from other places for\r\n  Brook and Helliers. Gentlemen are therefore desired, when they suspect\r\n  themselves imposed on, to send the wine immediately to the place they\r\n  ordered it from, or a note of what it was they sent for, in order to\r\n  know the truth, and Brook and Helliers will bear the extraordinary\r\n  charge of porters on this occasion.\r\n\r\nFrom this and kindred advertisements it looks as though gentlemen were\r\nnot at the time in the habit of keeping large quantities of wine in the\r\nhouse, but rather of having it in fresh and fresh as required from the\r\ntavern, or of going round themselves, and taking it home under their\r\nbelts. Also the servants of the time do not appear to be possessed of\r\nmuch more honesty than falls to the lot of the domestics of even these\r\ndegenerate days. The effect of the rage for port as soon as it was once\r\ntried, is shown by the following, which also appeared in the January of\r\n1712, in the _Daily Courant_:--\r\n\r\n  THE first loss is the best especially in the Wine Trade, and upon that\r\n  consideration Mr John Crooke will now sell his French Claret for 4s. a\r\n  gallon, to make an end of a troublesome and losing trade. Dated the\r\n  7th of January from his vault in Broad street, 5 doors below the Angel\r\n  and Crown Tavern, behind the Royal Exchange.\r\n\r\n  JOHN CROOKE.\r\n\r\nBut this appeal to the lovers of bargains, as well as of claret, was\r\nevidently a failure; for three or four days afterwards, and also in the\r\nsame paper, another, and quite different attempt, is made to draw the\r\nunwilling drinkers to the Angel and Crown:--\r\n\r\n  IT having been represented to Mr John Crooke that notwithstanding the\r\n  general approbation his French claret has received, yet many of his\r\n  customers out of a covetous disposition do resort to other places to\r\n  buy much inferior wine, and afterwards sell the same for Mr Crooke’s\r\n  claret, which practices (if not timely prevented) do manifestly tend\r\n  to the ruin of his undertaking, and he being firmly resolved to\r\n  establish and preserve the reputation of his vault, and also willing\r\n  to give his customers all fitting encouragement; for these causes and\r\n  others hereunto him moving, he gives notice that from henceforth he\r\n  will sell his very good French claret for no more than 4s. a gallon at\r\n  his vault.\r\n\r\nThe fight between port and claret was very fierce this year, but the new\r\ndrink had almost from the first the best of the battle, if we may judge\r\nfrom the strenuous appeals put forth by those who have much claret to\r\nsell, and who evidently find it very like a drug upon their hands. One\r\nindividual seems at last to arrive at the conclusion that he may as well\r\nask a high price as a low one for his claret, seeing that people are\r\nunwilling to buy in either case. The advertisement occurs in the _Daily\r\nCourant_ for December 29, 1712. The wily concocter of the plan also\r\nthinks that by making three bottles the smallest limit of his sale, the\r\nunwary may fancy a favour is being conferred upon them, and buy\r\naccordingly:--\r\n\r\n  THE noblest new French claret that ever was imported, bright, deep,\r\n  strong and of most delicious flavour, being of the very best growth in\r\n  France, and never in any cooper or vintner’s hands, but purely neat\r\n  from the grape, bottled off from the lee. All the quality and gentry\r\n  that taste it, allow it to be the finest flower that ever was drunk.\r\n  Price 42s. the dozen, bottles and all, which is but 3s. 6d. a bottle,\r\n  for excellence not to be matched for double that price. None less than\r\n  3 bottles. To be had only at the Golden Key, in Haydon Yard, in the\r\n  Minories, where none but the very best and perfectly neat wine shall\r\n  ever be sold.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to believe that the claret which had been so\r\npopular up till this period, was a very different wine from that which\r\nis now known by the same name. It was, most probably, a strong\r\nwell-sweetened drink; for, as it has ever been necessary to make port\r\nthick and sweet for the public taste, it is most likely this was at\r\nfirst done for the purpose of rivalling the claret, and folk would\r\nhardly have turned suddenly from one wine to another of a decidedly\r\nopposite character. The amount of advertising, probably fostered by the\r\nwine rivalry, grew so much this year, that the Ministry were struck with\r\nthe happy idea of putting a tax upon every notice, and accordingly there\r\nis a sudden fall off in the number of advertisements in and after\r\nAugust, the month in which the change took place. In fact, the _Daily\r\nCourant_ appears several times with only one advertisement, that of\r\nDrury Lane Theatre, the average number being hitherto about nine or ten.\r\nHowever, the imposers of the tax were quite right in their estimate of\r\nthe value of advertisements; as, though checked for a time, they\r\nultimately grew again, though their progress was comparatively slow\r\ncompared with previous days. We find a characteristic announcement just\r\nat the close of the year, one not to be checked by the duty-charge, and\r\nso we append it:--\r\n\r\n  THIS is to give notice That there is a young woman born within 30\r\n  miles of London will run for £50 or £100, a mile and an half, with any\r\n  other woman that has liv’d a year within the same distance; upon any\r\n  good ground, as the parties concern’d shall agree to.\r\n\r\nUnnatural and unfeminine exhibitions, in accordance with this\r\nadvertisement, of pugilism, foot-racing, cudgel-playing, &c., were at\r\nthis time not unfrequent, and the spectacle of two women stripped to the\r\nwaist, and doing their best to injure or wear down each other, was often\r\nenjoyed by the bloods of the early eighteenth century. At the same time\r\nthat the tax was placed on advertisements, the stamp-duty on newspapers\r\nbecame an accomplished fact, and Swift in his journal to Stella of July\r\n9, 1712, says, “Grub Street has but ten days to live, then an Act of\r\nParliament takes place that ruins it by taxing every half-sheet a\r\nhalfpenny.” And just about a month after, he chronicles the effect of\r\nthis cruelty: “Do you know that Grub Street is dead and gone last week?\r\nNo more ghosts or murders now for love or money. I plied it close the\r\nlast fortnight and published at least seven papers of my own, besides\r\nsome of other people’s; but now every single half-sheet pays a halfpenny\r\nto the Queen. The _Observator_ is fallen; the _Medleys_ have jumbled\r\ntogether with the _Flying Post_; the _Examiner_ is deadly sick; the\r\n_Spectator_ keeps up and doubles its price. I know not how long it will\r\nhold. Have you seen the red stamp the papers are marked with? Methinks\r\nthe stamping is worth a halfpenny.” Thieves about this time seem to have\r\nhad delicate susceptibilities, for it was the custom to advertise goods\r\nwhich were undoubtedly stolen as lost. Thus we see constantly in the\r\nreign of Queen Anne such notices as this: “Lost out of a room in Russell\r\nStreet a number of valuable objects.... Whoever brings them _back_ shall\r\nhave ten guineas reward, or in proportion for any part, and no questions\r\nasked.” This style of advertising grew so that just about the middle of\r\nthe century it was found necessary to put a stop to it by Act of\r\nParliament, which took effect on the 21st of June 1752, the penalty\r\nbeing £50 for any one who advertised “no questions asked,” and £50 for\r\nthe publisher who inserted any such notice in his paper. Haydn gives\r\nthis date as 1754, but a reference to the _General Advertiser_ of\r\nFebruary 21, 1752, in which the notice of the date on which the law is\r\nto come into effect appears, shows that it was two years earlier. Also a\r\nreference to any Parliamentary record of forty years before that will\r\nshow that not in 1713, as Haydn has it, but on the 22nd April 1712, Mr\r\nConyers reported from Committee of the whole House, who were considering\r\nfurther ways and means for raising the supply granted to her Majesty;\r\nwhen among other measures it was resolved that a duty of 12d. be charged\r\nfor every advertisement in any printed paper, besides the stamp-duty\r\nwhich was at the same time imposed on the newspapers. This and other\r\nextra taxes were levied, because France having refused to acknowledge\r\nthe title of Queen Anne till the peace should be signed, it was resolved\r\nto continue the war “till a safe and honourable peace could be\r\nobtained.” For this purpose money was of course required; and if they\r\nnever did good any other way, or at any other time, quacks and\r\nimpostors, libertines and drunkards, did it now, as they mainly\r\ncontributed all that was gathered for some years by means of the\r\nadvertisement tax. There seems to have been a good deal of drunkenness\r\ngoing on in the time of Queen Anne, and the tavern keepers contributed\r\nin many ways to swell the revenue. But even their advertisements drop\r\noff after the imposition of the tax, as do those of promoters of\r\nnostrums and lotteries, and the managers of theatres. These public\r\nbenefactors are, however, not so blind to their own interests, but that\r\nthey soon return.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the many important events of the next few years, nothing\r\nworthy of chronicling in the way of advertisements is to be found till\r\n1720, when we come upon the following, which is peculiar as being one of\r\nthe earliest specimens of the ventilation of private quarrels by means\r\nof advertisements. It occurs in the _Daily Post_ of January 16th:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS an advertisement was lately put in Heathcote’s Halfpenny Post,\r\n  by way of challenge for me to meet a person (whose name to me is\r\n  unknown) at Old Man’s Coffeehouse near Charing Cross, the 28 instant\r\n  in order to hear that said person make out his assertions in that\r\n  Dialogue we had in Palace Yard, the 11th of November 1718, This will\r\n  let that person know that as he would not then tell me his name, nor\r\n  put it to his advertisement, I conclude he is ashamed to have it in\r\n  print. When he sends me his name in writing, that I may know who to\r\n  ask for, I shall be willing to meet him at any convenient time and\r\n  place, either by ourselves or with two friends on each side, till then\r\n  I shall have neither list nor leisure to obey his nameless summons.\r\n\r\n  ROBERT CURTIS.\r\n\r\n  Southwark, Jan. 13th, 1719-20.\r\n\r\nCertainly time enough seems to have elapsed between the dialogue and the\r\npublication of this advertisement to allow of all angry passions to have\r\nsubsided; but Robert Curtis, whose name is thus preserved till now,\r\nwould seem to have been a careful youth, picking his way clear of\r\npitfalls, and with shrewdness sufficient to discover that anonymity but\r\ntoo often disguises foul intent. In that particular matters have not\r\nconsiderably improved even up to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe year 1720 is memorable in the history of England, as seeing the\r\nabnormal growth and consequent explosion of the greatest swindle of\r\ncomparatively modern times, and one of the most colossal frauds of any\r\ntime, the South Sea Scheme, which has been best known since as the South\r\nSea Bubble. Its story has been told so often, and in so many ways, that\r\nit is hardly necessary to dwell upon it here; but as, though nearly\r\nevery one has heard of the scheme, there are but few who know anything\r\nabout it, we may as well give once again a short _résumé_ of its\r\nbusiness operations. It was started by Harley in 1711, with the view of\r\npaying off the floating national debt, which at that time amounted to\r\nabout £10,000,000. A contemporary writer says: “This debt was taken up\r\nby a number of eminent merchants, to whom the Government agreed to\r\nguarantee for a certain period the annual payment of £600,000 (being six\r\nper cent. interest), a sum which was to be obtained by rendering\r\npermanent a number of import duties. The monopoly of the trade to the\r\nSouth Seas was also secured to these merchants, who were accordingly\r\nincorporated as the ‘South Sea Company,’ and at once rose to a high\r\nposition in the mercantile world. The wondrously extravagant ideas then\r\ncurrent respecting the riches of the South American continent were\r\ncarefully fostered and encouraged by the Company, who also took care to\r\nspread the belief that Spain was prepared, on certain liberal\r\nconditions, to admit them to a considerable share of its South American\r\ntrade; and as a necessary consequence, a general avidity to partake in\r\nthe profits of this most lucrative speculation sprang up in the public\r\nmind. It may be well to remark in this place, that the Company’s trading\r\nprojects had no other result than a single voyage of one ship in 1717,\r\nand that its prominence in British history is due entirely to its\r\nexistence as a purely monetary corporation. Notwithstanding the absence\r\nof any symptoms of its carrying out its great trading scheme, the\r\nCompany had obtained a firm hold on popular favour, and its shares rose\r\nday by day; and even when the outbreak of war with Spain in 1718\r\ndeprived the most sanguine of the slightest hope of sharing in the\r\ntreasures of the South Seas, the Company continued to flourish. Far from\r\nbeing alarmed at the expected and impending failure of a similar\r\nproject--the Mississippi Scheme--the South Sea Company believed\r\nsincerely in the feasibility of Law’s Scheme, and resolved to avoid what\r\nthey considered as his errors. Trusting to the possibility of pushing\r\ncredit to its utmost extent without danger, they proposed, in the spring\r\nof 1720, to take upon themselves the whole national debt (at that time\r\n£30,981,712) on being guaranteed 5 per cent. per annum for seven and a\r\nhalf years, at the end of which time the debt might be redeemed if the\r\nGovernment chose, and the interest reduced to 4 per cent. The directors\r\nof the Bank of England, jealous of the prospective benefit and influence\r\nwhich would thus accrue to the South Sea Company, submitted to\r\nGovernment a counter-proposal; but the more dazzling nature of their\r\nrival’s offer secured its acceptance by Parliament--in the Commons by\r\n172 to 55, and (April 7) in the Lords by 83 to 17; Sir Robert Walpole in\r\nthe former, and Lords North and Grey, the Duke of Wharton and Earl\r\nCowper in the latter, in vain protesting against it as involving\r\ninevitable ruin. During the passing of their bill, the Company’s stock\r\nrose steadily to 330 on April 7,[32] falling to 290 on the following\r\nday. Up till this date the scheme had been honestly promoted; but now,\r\nseeing before them the prospect of speedily amassing abundant wealth,\r\nthe directors threw aside all scruples, and made use of every effective\r\nmeans at their command, honest or dishonest, to keep up the factitious\r\nvalue of the stock. Their zealous endeavours were crowned with success;\r\nthe shares were quoted at 550 on May 28, and 890 on June 1. A general\r\nimpression having by this time gained ground that the stock had reached\r\nits maximum, so many holders rushed to realise that the price fell to\r\n630 on June 3. As this decline did not suit the personal interests of\r\nthe directors, they sent agents to buy up eagerly; and on the evening of\r\nJune 3, 750 was the quoted price. This and similar artifices were\r\nemployed as required, and had the effect of ultimately raising the\r\nshares to 1000 in the beginning of August, when the chairman of the\r\nCompany and some of the principal directors sold out. On this becoming\r\nknown, a widespread uneasiness seized the holders of stock; every one\r\nwas eager to part with his shares, and on September 12 they fell to 400,\r\nin spite of all the attempts of the directors to bolster up the\r\nCompany’s credit. The consternation of those who had been either unable\r\nor unwilling to part with their scrip was now extreme; many capitalists\r\nabsconded, either to avoid ruinous bankruptcy, or to secure their\r\nill-gotten gains, and the Government became seriously alarmed at the\r\nexcited state of public feeling. Attempts were made to prevail on the\r\nBank to come to the rescue by circulating some millions of Company’s\r\nbonds; but as the shares still declined, and the Company’s chief\r\ncashiers, the Sword Blade Company, now stopped payment, the Bank refused\r\nto entertain the proposal. The country was now wound up to a most\r\nalarming pitch of excitement; the punishment of the fraudulent directors\r\nwas clamorously demanded, and Parliament was hastily summoned (December\r\n8) to deliberate on the best means of mitigating this great calamity.\r\nBoth Houses proved, however, to be in as impetuous a mood as the public;\r\nand in spite of the moderate counsels of Walpole, it was resolved\r\n(December 9) to punish the authors of the national distresses, though\r\nhitherto no fraudulent acts had been proved against them. An examination\r\nof the proceedings of the Company was at once commenced; and on\r\nWalpole’s proposal nine millions of South Sea bonds were taken up by the\r\nBank, and a similar amount by the East India Company. The officials of\r\nthe Company were forbidden to leave the kingdom for twelve months, or to\r\ndispose of any of their property or effects. Ultimately various schemes,\r\ninvolving the deepest fraud and villany, were discovered to have been\r\nsecretly concocted and carried out by the directors; and it was proved\r\nthat the Earl of Sunderland, the Duchess of Kendal, the Countess Platen\r\nand her two nieces, Mr Craggs, M.P., the Company’s secretary, Mr Charles\r\nStanhope, a secretary of the Treasury, and the Sword Blade Company, had\r\nbeen bribed to promote the Company’s bill in Parliament by a present of\r\n£170,000 of South Sea stock. The total amount of fictitious stock\r\ncreated for this and similar purposes was £1,260,000, nearly one-half of\r\nwhich had been disposed of. Equally flagrant iniquity in the allocation\r\nof shares was discovered, in which, among others, Mr Aislabie, the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, was implicated. Of these offenders, Mr\r\nStanhope and the Earl of Sunderland were acquitted through the unworthy\r\npartiality of the Parliament; but Mr Aislabie, and the other directors\r\nwho were members of the House of Commons, were expelled; most of the\r\ndirectors were discovered, and all of them suffered confiscation of\r\ntheir possessions. The chairman was allowed to retain only £5000 out of\r\n£183,000, and others in proportion to their share in the fraudulent\r\ntransactions of the Company. At the end of 1720, it being found that\r\n£13,300,000 of real stock belonged to the Company, £8,000,000 of this\r\nwas taken and divided among the losers, giving them a dividend of 33⅓\r\nper cent.; and by other schemes of adjustment the pressure was so fairly\r\nand wisely distributed, that the excitement gradually subsided.” It will\r\nthus be seen that the South Sea Bubble was, after all, not more\r\ndisastrous in its effects than many modern and comparatively unknown\r\nspeculations.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that the South Sea Bubble led to little--almost\r\nnothing--in the way of advertisements. When we think of the columns\r\nwhich now herald the advent of any new company, or for the matter of\r\nthat, any new idea of an old company, or any fresh specific or article\r\nof clothing, it seems strange that at a time when the art of advertising\r\nwas fast becoming fashionable, no invitations to subscribe were\r\npublished in any of the daily or weekly papers that then existed. Just\r\nbefore the consent of Parliament was obtained we find one or two stray\r\nadvertisements certainly, but they have no official status, as may be\r\njudged by this, which is from the _Post Boy_, April 2-5, 1720:--\r\n\r\n  ⸸*⸸ Some Calculations relating to the Proposals made by the South Sea\r\n  Company and the Bank of England, to the House of Commons; Showing the\r\n  loss to the New Subscribers, at the several Rates in the said\r\n  Computations mention’d; and the Gain which will thereby accrue to the\r\n  Proprietors of the Old South Sea Stock. By a Member of the House of\r\n  Commons. Sold by J. Morphew near Stationers Hall. Pr. 1s. Where may\r\n  be obtained Mr. Hutchison’s Answer to Mr. Crookshank’s Seasonable\r\n  Remarks.\r\n\r\nIn the _Daily Courant_ of April 4 is also the following, which shows the\r\nimmense amount of the stock possessed by private individuals. The reward\r\noffered for the recovery of the warrant seems ridiculously small, let\r\nits value be what it might to the finder:--\r\n\r\n  Lost or mislaid, a South Sea Dividend Warrant No. 1343 dated the 25th\r\n  of February last, made out to John Powell Esq. for 630_l_ being for\r\n  his Half Years Dividend on 21,000_l_ stock due the 25th of December\r\n  last. If offered in Payment or otherwise please to stop it and give\r\n  Notice to Mr Robert Harris at the South Sea House, and you shall\r\n  receive 10s Reward, it not being endorsed by the said John Powell Esq.\r\n  is of no use but to the Owner, Payment being Stopt.\r\n\r\nThe only official notification in reference to the Bubble is found in\r\nthe _London Gazette_, “published by authority,” of April 5-9, 1720. It\r\nis the commencement of a list of Acts passed by the King, and runs\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n  _Westminster, April 7._\r\n\r\n  HIS Majesty came this Day to the House of Peers, and being in his\r\n  Royal Robes seated on the Throne with the usual Solemnity, Sir William\r\n  Saunderson, Gentleman-Usher of the Black Rod, was sent with a Message\r\n  from His Majesty to the House of Commons, commanding their Attendance\r\n  in the House of Peers; the Commons being come thither accordingly, His\r\n  Majesty was pleased to give the Royal Assent to\r\n\r\n  _An Act for enabling the South Sea Company to increase their present\r\n  Capital Stock and Fund, by redeeming such publick Debts and\r\n  Incumbrances as are therein mentioned, and for raising Money for\r\n  lessening several of the publick Debts and Incumbrances, and for\r\n  calling in the present Exchequer Bills remaining uncancelled, and for\r\n  making forth new Bills in lieu thereof to be circulated and exchanged\r\n  upon Demand at or near the Exchequer._\r\n\r\nThe advertisement then goes on to state what other Acts received the\r\nroyal assent, but with none of them have we anything to do. In the _Post\r\nBoy_ of June 25-28 there is a notice of a contract being lost, which\r\nruns thus:--\r\n\r\n  WHereas a Contract for the Delivery of South Sea Stock made between\r\n  William Byard Grey, Esq. and Mr. William Ferrour is mislaid or dropt:\r\n  If the Person who is possess’d of it will bring it to the Wheat-Sheaf\r\n  in Warwick-Lane, he shall have Ten Guineas Reward, and no Questions\r\n  ask’d.\r\n\r\nAnd in the issue of the same paper for June 30-July 1 we find this,\r\nwhich refers to the Company on which all the South Sea directors’ orders\r\nwere made payable:--\r\n\r\n  FOund at the South Sea House Saturday the 17th of June a Sword-Blade\r\n  Company’s Note. If the Person that lost it will apply to Mr.\r\n  Colston’s, a Toy Shop at the Flower-de-Luce against the Exchange in\r\n  Cornhill, and describe the said Note shall have it return’d, paying\r\n  the Charge of the Advertisement.\r\n\r\nThese are, however, only incidental advertisements, which might have\r\noccurred had the Company been anything but that which it was; and so we\r\nhave only to remark on the peculiar quietness with which all rigging\r\noperations were managed in those days. One of the paragraphs quoted in a\r\nnote a short distance back will, however, account for the fact that\r\nadvertisements were not found in the usual places.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the disgusting system which permitted of public combats\r\nbetween women is exhibited in several advertisements of 1722, the most\r\nnoticeable among them being one in which a challenge and reply are\r\npublished as inducements to the public to disburse their cash and\r\nwitness a spectacle which must have made many a strong man sick:--\r\n\r\n  CHALLENGE.--I, Elizabeth Wilkinson, of Clerkenwell, having had some\r\n  words with Hannah Hyfield, and requiring satisfaction, do invite her\r\n  to meet me upon the stage, and box me for three guineas; each woman\r\n  holding half a crown in each hand, and the first woman that drops the\r\n  money to lose the battle.\r\n\r\n  ANSWER.--I, Hannah Hyfield, of Newgate Market, hearing of the\r\n  resoluteness of Elizabeth Wilkinson, will not fail, _God willing_, to\r\n  give her more blows than words, desiring home blows, and from her no\r\n  favour; she may expect a good thumping!\r\n\r\nThe precaution taken with the half-crowns to keep the hands clenched and\r\nso prevent scratching, shows that even these degraded creatures had not\r\nquite forgotten the peculiarities of the sex. And that there is piety in\r\npugilism--even of this kind--is proved by the admittance that the Deity\r\nhad to give his consent to “the ladies’ battle.” But Mesdames Wilkinson\r\nand Hyfield sink into insignificance when compared with the heroines of\r\nthe following, which is cut from the _Daily Post_ of July 17, 1728:--\r\n\r\n  AT _Mr. Stokes’ Amphitheatre_ in Islington Road, this present Monday,\r\n  being the 7 of October, will be a complete Boxing Match by the two\r\n  following Championesses:--Whereas I, Ann Field, of Stoke Newington,\r\n  ass-driver, well known for my abilities in boxing in my own defence\r\n  wherever it happened in my way, having been affronted by Mrs. Stokes,\r\n  styled the European Championess, do fairly invite her to a trial of\r\n  the best skill in boxing for 10 pounds, fair rise and fall; and\r\n  question not but to give her such proofs of my judgment that shall\r\n  oblige her to acknowledge me Championess of the Stage, to the entire\r\n  satisfaction of all my friends.\r\n\r\n  I, Elizabeth Stokes, of the City of London, have not fought in this\r\n  way since I fought the famous boxing woman of Billingsgate 29 minutes\r\n  and gained a complete victory (which is six years ago); but as the\r\n  famous Stoke Newington ass-woman dares me to fight her for the 10\r\n  pounds, I do assure her I will not fail meeting her for the said sum,\r\n  and doubt not that the blows which I shall present her with will be\r\n  more difficult for her to digest, than any she ever gave her asses.\r\n  _Note._--A man known by the name of Rugged and Tuff, challenges the\r\n  best man of Stoke Newington to fight him for one guinea to what sum\r\n  they please to venture. _N.B._--Attendance will be given at one, and\r\n  the encounter to begin at four precisely. There will be the diversion\r\n  of cudgel-playing as usual.\r\n\r\nPugilism was evidently a much valued accomplishment among the\r\nlower-class ladies in 1728, and there is no doubt that Mrs Stokes and\r\nMrs Field were considered very estimable persons as well as great\r\nathletes in their respective circles. There is, moreover, a suspicion of\r\nhumour about the reference to the asses in the reply of Mrs Stokes. In\r\nthe happily-named Rugged and Tuff we see the forerunner of that line of\r\nchampions of the ring which, commencing with Figg and Broughton, ran\r\nunbroken up to comparatively modern days. Other advertisements about\r\nthis period relate to cock-matches and mains, sometimes specified to\r\n“last the week,” to bull-baiting in its ordinary and sometimes in its\r\nmore cruel form of dressing up the beasts with fireworks, so as to\r\nexcite both them and the savage dogs to their utmost. Perhaps brutality\r\nwas never so rampant, or affected so many phases of society as it did in\r\nthe first half of the eighteenth century. Slavery was considered a\r\nheaven-born institution, not alone as regards coloured races, for\r\nexpeditions to the Plantations went on merrily and afforded excellent\r\nopportunities for the disposal of any one who happened to make himself\r\nobjectionable by word or deed, or even by his very existence. The wicked\r\nuncle with an eye on the family property had a very good time then, and\r\nthe rightful heir was often doomed to a slavery almost worse than death.\r\nApropos of slavery, we may as well quote a very short advertisement\r\nwhich shows how the home trade flourished in 1728. It is from the _Daily\r\nJournal_ of September 28:--\r\n\r\n  TO be sold, a Negro boy, aged eleven years. Enquire of the Virginia\r\n  Coffee-house in Threadneedle street, behind the Royal Exchange.\r\n\r\nNegroes had in 1728 become quite common here, and had pushed out their\r\npredecessors, the Moors and Asiatics, who formerly held submissive\r\nservitude. This was probably owing to the nefarious traffic commenced in\r\n1680 by Hawkins, which in little more than a hundred years caused the\r\ndeparture from their African homes and the transplanting in Jamaica\r\nalone of 910,000 negroes, to say nothing of those who died on the\r\nvoyage, or who found their way to England and other countries.\r\n\r\n  [28] This is Partridge the almanac-maker, who was fortunate enough to\r\n  be mentioned in the “Rape of the Lock.” After the rape has taken place\r\n  the poem goes on to say--\r\n\r\n    “This the _beau monde_ shall from the Mall survey,\r\n    And hail with music its propitious ray;\r\n    This the blest lover shall for Venus take,\r\n    And send up prayers from Rosamunda’s lake;\r\n    This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies,\r\n    When next he looks through Galileo’s eyes;\r\n    And hence the egregious wizard shall foredoom\r\n    The fate of Louis and the fall of Rome.”\r\n\r\n  It would seem, therefore, that the guiding spirits of the _Tatler_,\r\n  fancying that he had received undue publicity in a favourable manner,\r\n  were disposed to show Partridge that all advertisements are not\r\n  necessarily adjuncts to business.\r\n\r\n  [29] An advertising trussmaker of that day.\r\n\r\n  [30] A specimen advertisement of one of these inventors appears in the\r\n  _Postman_ of January 6-9, 1705:--\r\n\r\n  SINCE so many upstarts do daily publish one thing or other to\r\n  counterfeit the original strops, for setting razors, penknives,\r\n  lancets, etc., upon, And pretend them to be most excellent; the first\r\n  author of the said strops, does hereby testify that all such sort of\r\n  things are only made in imitation of the true ones, which are\r\n  permitted to be sold by no one but Mr Shipton, at John’s Coffee House,\r\n  in Exchange Alley, as hath been often mentioned in the Gazettes, to\r\n  prevent people being further imposed upon.\r\n\r\n  An opposition notice appears shortly afterwards in the _Daily Courant_\r\n  of January 11:--\r\n\r\n  THE _Right Venetian Strops_, being the only fam’d ones made, as\r\n  appears by the many thousands that have been sold, notwithstanding the\r\n  many false shams and ridiculous pretences, as “original,” etc., that\r\n  are almost every day published to promote the sale of counterfeits,\r\n  and to lessen the great and truly wonderful fame of the _Venetian\r\n  Strops_, which are most certainly the best in the world, for they will\r\n  give razors, penknives, lancets, etc., such an exquisite fine, smooth,\r\n  sharp, exact and durable edge, that the like was never known, which\r\n  has been experienced by thousands of gentlemen in England, Scotland\r\n  and Ireland. Are sold only at Mr Allcraft’s, a toy shop at the Blue\r\n  Coat Boy, against the Royal Exchange, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n  [31] Both oculists of some renown, who advertised largely.\r\n\r\n  [32] On January 1, 1720, the _Daily Courant_, and other papers, quote\r\n  South Sea Stock at 127¾, 128⅝, to 128. Bank 150¼. India 200, 200½, to\r\n  200. The quotation for Thursday, April 7 (in _Daily Post_, Friday,\r\n  April 8), is, “Yesterday South Sea Stock was 314, 310, 311, 309, 309½,\r\n  to 310. Bank 145. India 223.” On the 27th May it was 555, and Bank was\r\n  205 (_Post Boy_, May 28). It then fell a little, but in the _Daily\r\n  Courant_ of June 2 it is quoted at 610 to 760, Bank 210 to 220, India\r\n  290 to 300. The _Daily Post_ of Wednesday, June 8, contains the\r\n  following puff for the scheme: “’Tis said that the South Sea Company\r\n  being willing to have all the Annuities subscribed to their Stock, now\r\n  offer forty-five years’ purchase for those which have not yet been\r\n  bought in.” And again: “The Annuities which have been subscribed into\r\n  the South Sea Stock are risen to a very great height, so that what\r\n  would formerly sell but for £1500, is now worth £8000.” In the _Post\r\n  Boy_ of June 23-25, we find this: “Yesterday South Sea Stock was for\r\n  the opening of the Book 1100. 1st Subscr. 565, 2d Subscr. 610, 3rd\r\n  Subscr. 200. Bank 265. East India 440.” On Friday, June 24, the _Daily\r\n  Post_ says, “We hear that South Sea Stock was sold yesterday at 1000\r\n  per cent., and great wagers are laid that it will be currently sold\r\n  before the opening of the Books at 1200 per cent. exclusive of the\r\n  Dividend.” It is several times after this quoted at 1100, but never\r\n  over. These compilations show that a higher rate was attained by the\r\n  stock than is given in the article quoted above, or is generally\r\n  believed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n_MIDDLE OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe further we advance into the years which mark the Hanoverian\r\nsuccession, the more profligate, reckless, and cruel do the people seem\r\nto become. Public exhibitions of the most disgusting character are every\r\nday advertised; ruffians and swashbucklers abound, and are ready to do\r\nanything for a consideration; animals are tortured at set periods for\r\nthe delectation of the multitude; and we see verified, by means of the\r\nnotices in the papers, the peculiarities which Hogarth seized and made\r\nimmortal, and which so many squeamish people consider to be overdrawn\r\nnowadays. Assignations of the most immoral character are openly\r\nadvertised, and men of the time may well have attempted to ignore the\r\nexistence of female virtue. A recent writer, commenting on this state of\r\naffairs, says, in reference to the latter class of shameless\r\nadvertisements: “We are far from saying that such matters are not\r\nmanaged now through the medium of advertisements, for they are, but in\r\nhow much more carefully concealed a manner? The perfect contempt of\r\npublic opinion, or rather the public acquiescence in such infringements\r\nof the moral law which it exhibits, proves the general state of morality\r\nmore than the infringements themselves, which obtain more or less at all\r\ntimes. Two of the causes which led to this low tone of manners with\r\nrespect to women were doubtless the detestable profligacy of the courts\r\nof the two first Georges, and the very defective condition of the\r\nexisting marriage law. William and Mary, and Anne, had, by their\r\ndecorous, not to say frigid lives, redeemed the crown, and in some\r\nmeasure the aristocracy, from the vices of the Restoration. Crown,\r\ncourt, and quality, however, fell into a still worse slough on the\r\naccession of the Hanoverian king, who soiled afresh the rising tone of\r\npublic life by his scandalous connection with the Duchess of Kendal and\r\nthe Countess of Darlington; whilst his son and successor was absolutely\r\nabetted in his vicious courses by his own queen, who promoted his\r\ncommerce with his two mistresses, the Countesses of Suffolk and\r\nYarmouth. The degrading influence of the royal manners was well seconded\r\nby the condition of the law. Keith’s Chapel in Mayfair, and that at the\r\nFleet, were the Gretna Greens of the age, where children could get\r\nmarried at any time of the day or night for a couple of crowns. It was\r\nsaid at the time that at the former chapel six thousand persons were\r\nannually married in this offhand way; the youngest of the beautiful Miss\r\nGunnings was wedded to the Duke of Hamilton at twelve o’clock at night,\r\nwith a ring off the bed-curtain, at this very ‘marriage-shop.’ The\r\nfruits of such unions may be imagined. The easy way in which the\r\nmarriage bond was worn and broken through, is clearly indicated by the\r\nadvertisements which absolutely crowd the public journals, from the\r\naccession of the house of Brunswick up to the time of the third George,\r\nof husbands warning the public not to trust their runaway wives.” It\r\nmust not be imagined, though, that wives were the only sinners, or that\r\nvice was confined to any particular and exclusive class. It was the\r\nluxury of all, and according to their opportunities all enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Fleet marriages, and the scandals consequent upon them,\r\nwere in full swing. In a number of the _Weekly Journal_ this statement\r\nis made: “From an inspection into the several registers for marriages\r\nkept at the several alehouses, brandy-shops, &c., within the Rules of\r\nthe Fleet Prison, we find no less than thirty-two couples joined\r\ntogether from Monday to Thursday last without licences, contrary to an\r\nexpress Act of Parliament against clandestine marriages, that lays a\r\nsevere fine of £200 on the minister so offending, and £100 each on the\r\npersons so married in contradiction to the said statute. Several of the\r\nabove-named brandy-men and victuallers keep clergymen in their houses at\r\n20s. per week, hit or miss; but it is reported that one there will stoop\r\nto no such low conditions, but makes at least £500 per annum of Divinity\r\njobs after that manner.” A fair specimen of the kind of advertisement\r\npublished by these gentlemen is this:--\r\n\r\n  G. R.--At the True Chapel, at the old Red Hand and Mitre, three doors\r\n  up Fleet Lane, and next door to the White Swan, Marriages are\r\n  performed by authority by the Rev. Mr. Symson, educated at the\r\n  University of Cambridge, and late chaplain to the Earl of Rothes.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--Without imposition.\r\n\r\nA curious phase of the dangers of the streets is found in a narrative\r\npublished in the _Grub Street Journal_ of 1735, which is well worth\r\nreproducing: “Since midsummer last a young lady of birth and fortune was\r\ndeluded and forced from her friends, and by the assistance of a\r\nwrynecked swearing parson, married to an atheistical wretch, whose life\r\nis a continued practice of all manner of vice and debauchery. And since\r\nthe ruin of my relative, another lady of my acquaintance had like to\r\nhave been trepanned in the following manner: This lady had appointed to\r\nmeet a gentlewoman at the Old Playhouse in Drury Lane, but extraordinary\r\nbusiness prevented her coming. Being alone when the play was done, she\r\nbade a boy call a coach for the city. One dressed like a gentleman helps\r\nher into it, and jumps in after her. ‘Madam,’ says he, ‘this coach was\r\ncalled for me, and since the weather is so bad, and there is no other, I\r\nbeg leave to bear you company; I am going into the City, and will set\r\nyou down wherever you please.’ The lady begged to be excused, but he\r\nbade the coachman drive on. Being come to Ludgate Hill, he told her his\r\nsister, who waited his coming but five doors up the court, would go with\r\nher in two minutes. He went, and returned with his pretended sister, who\r\nasked her to step in one minute, and she would wait upon her in the\r\ncoach. The poor lady foolishly followed her into the house, when\r\ninstantly the sister vanished, and a tawny fellow in a black coat and a\r\nblack wig appeared. ‘Madam, you are come in good time, the doctor was\r\njust agoing!’ ‘The doctor!’ says she, terribly frighted, fearing it was\r\na madhouse; ‘what has the doctor to do with me?’ ‘To marry you to that\r\ngentleman. The doctor has waited for you these three hours, and will be\r\npaid by you or that gentleman before you go!’ ‘That gentleman,’ says\r\nshe, recovering herself, ‘is worthy a better fortune than mine;’ and\r\nbegged hard to be gone. But Doctor Wryneck swore she should be married;\r\nor if she would not he would still have his fee, and register the\r\nmarriage for that night. The lady finding she could not escape without\r\nmoney or a pledge, told them she liked the gentleman so well she would\r\ncertainly meet him to-morrow night, and gave them a ring as a pledge,\r\n‘which,’ says she, ‘was my mother’s gift on her deathbed, enjoining\r\nthat, if ever I married, it should be my wedding ring;’ by which cunning\r\ncontrivance she was delivered from the black doctor and his tawny crew.”\r\nPennant, in his “Some Account of London,” says: “In walking along the\r\nstreet in my youth, on the side next the prison, I have often been\r\ntempted by the question, ‘Sir, will you be pleased to walk in and be\r\nmarried?’ Along this most lawless space was hung up the frequent sign of\r\na male and female hand enjoined, with ‘Marriages performed within’\r\nwritten beneath. A dirty fellow invited you in. The parson was seen\r\nwalking before his shop; a squalid, profligate figure, clad in a\r\ntattered plaid nightgown, with a fiery face, and ready to couple you for\r\na dram of gin or a roll of tobacco.” Some of the notes found in the\r\nregisters purchased by Government in 1821, and deposited with the\r\nRegistrar of the Consistory Court of London, are very amusing. Here are\r\none or two extracts: “June 10, 1729. John Nelson, of ye parish of St\r\nGeorge, Hanover, batchelor and gardener, and Mary Barnes, of ye same,\r\nsp. married. Cer. dated 5 November 1727, to please their parents.”\r\n“1742, May 24.--A soldier brought a barber to the Cock, who I think said\r\nhis name was James, barber by trade, was in part married to Elizabeth:\r\nthey said they were married enough.” “A coachman came, and was half\r\nmarried, and would give but 3s. 6d., and went off.” “Edward ---- and\r\nElizabeth ---- were married, and would not let me know their names.” A\r\npopular error was current at this time, that if a newly-married woman\r\nran across the street with nothing on but her shift, she would free her\r\nhusband from all liability as to her debts. More than once the\r\nfollowing, or words akin to it, is found: “The woman ran across Ludgate\r\nHill in her shift.” Riotous persons often terrified these parsons, such\r\nmemoranda as the following occurring now and again: “Had a noise for\r\nfour hours about the money.” “Married at a barber’s shop one Kerrils,\r\nfor half a guinea, after which it was extorted out of my pocket, and for\r\nfear of my life delivered.” “Harrowson swore most bitterly, and was\r\npleased to say that he was fully determined to kill the minister that\r\nmarried him. He came from Gravesend, and was sober.” And so on through\r\ninfinite variety. But to return to our advertisements.\r\n\r\nThough advertisements were by no means scarce about this time, the\r\nimposition of the duty still told heavily with regard to the regular\r\nbusiness community, for in regular trade few things were advertised with\r\nthe exception of books and quack medicines, all other commercial matters\r\nbeing disposed of by means of agents who advertised in a general manner,\r\nof which the following, from the _London Journal_ of February 7, 1730,\r\nis a fair specimen:--\r\n\r\n  THE _Public General_ CORRESPONDENCE _of affairs, for Improving Money,\r\n  Trade and Estates, etc._\r\n\r\n  Some Persons want to BUY ESTATES HELD BY LEASE from any Bishop, Dean\r\n  and Chapter, or College, either for Lives or Term of Years.\r\n\r\n  A Person desires to dispose of considerable SUMS OF MONEY, in such\r\n  manner as will bring him in the best interest, tho’ liable to some\r\n  uncertainty.\r\n\r\n  A Rev. Clergyman is willing to EXCHANGE A RECTORY of about £250 a\r\n  year, in a pleasant cheap country, for a Rectory in or near London,\r\n  tho’ of less value.\r\n\r\n  Persons who want to raise a considerable sum of money on ESTATES,\r\n  FREEHOLD or FOR LIFE, may be served therein, and in such a manner as\r\n  not to be obliged to repayment, if they do not see fit.\r\n\r\n  ESTATES _which some Persons want to_ BUY.\r\n\r\n  Some Freehold Lands not far from Hertford.--An Estate from £200 to\r\n  about £500 a year, within 60 miles of London.--A large Estate in\r\n  Middlesex or Hertfordshire.--A good Farm in Sussex or Surrey.--And\r\n  several persons want to buy and some to hire other estates.\r\n\r\n  ESTATES _which some Persons want to_ SELL.\r\n\r\n  Several good Houses in and about London, both Freehold and\r\n  Leasehold.--A very good house for a Gentleman, pleasantly situated\r\n  near Bury, with good gardens, etc. and some estate in land.--Several\r\n  houses fit for gentlemen in the country, within 20 miles of London,\r\n  some with and some without land.--And several persons want to sell,\r\n  and some to let other estates.\r\n\r\n  _The Particulars will be given by Mr Thomas Rogers_, Agent _for\r\n  persons who want any such business to be done. He answers letters_\r\n  Post-paid, _and advertises if desired, not otherwise_, All at his own\r\n  charge _if not successful_.\r\n\r\n  He gives Attendance as undermentioned:\r\n\r\n  Daily except Saturdays from 4 to 6 o’clock at home in Essex Street,\r\n  then at Rainbow Coffee-house, by the TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n  At 12  } Tuesday at Tom’s Coffee-house, by the EXCHANGE.\r\n  o’clock} Thursday at Will’s Coffee-house, near WHITEHALL.\r\n           And on sending for he will go to persons near.\r\n\r\nThe next advertisement which offers itself for special notice is of a\r\nsomewhat ludicrous character, and shows into what straits a man may get\r\nby means of a highly-developed imagination and an indiscreet tongue. It\r\nruns thus:--\r\n\r\n  _Bristol, January 19, 1732/3._\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS on or about the 10th day of November last I did say in the\r\n  Presence of Several People, That Anthony Coller, living at the Sign of\r\n  the Ship and Dove in the Pithay in Bristol, was sent to Newgate for\r\n  putting Live Toads in his Beer, in order to fine it; I do solemnly\r\n  declare, That I never knew any such Thing to have been done by the\r\n  said Coller nor do I believe he was ever guilty of the aforesaid or\r\n  any like Practice; I am therefore heartily sorry for what I have said\r\n  and hereby ask Pardon for the same of the above said Person, who, I\r\n  fear, has been greatly injur’d by the unguarded Tongue of\r\n\r\n  JOSEPH ROBINS.\r\n\r\nTo this curious confession, which was evidently extorted from the\r\nimaginative but timid Joseph, four witnesses appended their names. The\r\nnext gentleman to whom our attention is directed was still more\r\nunfortunate than Mr Robins, for he received punishment without having\r\ncommitted any particular offence. He, however, seems to have been made\r\nof very different mettle from the Bristol man, for he is anxious to try\r\nhis chances on better terms with those who assaulted him. The\r\nadvertisement is from the _Daily Post_ of January 22, 1739-40:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS on Saturday the 12th instant between six and seven at night, a\r\n  gentleman coming along the north side of Lincolns Inn fields was set\r\n  upon by three persons unknown and receiv’d several blows before he\r\n  could defend himself, upon a presumption, as they said that he was the\r\n  author of a Satire call’d “the Satirist.” This is to inform them that\r\n  they are greatly mistaken, and that the insulted person is neither the\r\n  author of that Satire nor of any Satire or Poem whatever, nor knows\r\n  what the said Satire contains: and therefore has reason to expect, if\r\n  they are Gentlemen, that they will not refuse him a meeting, by a line\r\n  to A. Z., to be left at the Bar of Dick’s Coffee House, Temple Bar, in\r\n  order to make him such atonement as shall be judged reasonable by the\r\n  friends on each side; otherwise he is ready to give any one of them,\r\n  singly, the satisfaction of a Gentleman, when and wherever shall be\r\n  appointed, so as he may not have to deal with Numbers.\r\n\r\nA. Z. must have been possessed of a considerable amount of faith if he\r\nbelieved that the rufflers who set upon him unawares would consent\r\neither to expose themselves, or to give what he and others called, in a\r\nthoughtless manner, “the satisfaction of a gentleman.” It must have\r\nbeen rare satisfaction at any time to be run through the body or shot\r\nthrough the head, after having been insulted or injured. In the _London\r\nDaily Post and General Advertiser_, shortly after this (February 5,\r\n1739-40), is an advertisement which looks suspiciously like a hoax,\r\nunless, indeed, it was believed at the time that one swallow would make\r\na summer. As the advertiser was probably devoted to the agricultural\r\ninterest, this is a not unlikely solution of the problem, more\r\nespecially as a caged bird would naturally not be expected to possess\r\nthe desired power:--\r\n\r\n  IF any person will deliver a Swallow, Swift (commonly called a Jack\r\n  Squeeler) or Martin, alive to Mr Thomas Meysey, at Bewdley in\r\n  Worcestershire, before the 22d day of this instant February, he shall\r\n  have Ten Guineas Reward paid him, and all reasonable charges allowed\r\n  him for his journey by the said Thomas Meysey: Or if any person will\r\n  deliver either of the said birds to Mr John Perrins, Distiller, in\r\n  Butcher Row, London, soon enough to send it to the said Thomas Meysey\r\n  at Bewdley before the 22d Instant February, and the bird shall be\r\n  alive when delivered, or come to live after it is delivered to the\r\n  said Thomas Meysey, he shall have Ten Guineas Reward paid him, and all\r\n  reasonable charges allowed him by the said John Perrins.\r\n\r\n  These birds are oftentimes found in the clifts in great rocks, old\r\n  chimneys, and old houses, seemingly dead; but when they are put before\r\n  a fire, they will come to life.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--It must not be a Swallow, Swift or Martin that has been kept\r\n  in a cage.\r\n\r\nThere must have been much capturing of small birds, and many may have\r\nbeen roasted alive in attempts to preserve them for the benefit of\r\nThomas Meysey. It certainly does appear as if about this time humour was\r\nso rife that it had to find vent in all sorts of strange advertisements,\r\nand the quacks were not slow to follow the lead thus set, as is shown by\r\nthe exercising swindle which follows, and which certainly must have\r\nexercised the minds of many who read it at the time. It appears in the\r\nsame paper as the foregoing, on March 7, 1739-40. (It is almost time by\r\nMarch to know what year one is in.)\r\n\r\n  FULLER _on_ EXERCISE.\r\n\r\n  (_A Book worth reading_)\r\n\r\n  NOTHING ought to be thought ridiculous that can afford the least ease\r\n  or procure health. A very worthy gentleman not long ago had such an\r\n  odd sort of a cholick, that he found nothing would relieve him so much\r\n  as lying with his head downwards; which posture prov’d always so\r\n  advantageous that he had a frame made to which he himself was fastened\r\n  with Bolts, and then was turned head downwards, after which manner he\r\n  hung till the pain went off. I hope none will say that this was\r\n  unbecoming a grave and wise man, to make use of such odd means to get\r\n  rid of an unsupportable pain. If people would but abstract the benefit\r\n  got by exercise from the means by which it is got, they would set a\r\n  great value upon it, if some of the advantages accruing from exercise\r\n  were to be procured by any other medicine, nothing in the world would\r\n  be in more esteem than that Medicine.\r\n\r\n  This is to answer some objections to the book of the Chamber Horse\r\n  (for exercise) invented by HENRY MARSH, in Clement’s Inn Passage,\r\n  Clare Market; who, it is well known, has had the honour to serve some\r\n  persons of the greatest distinction in the Kingdom; and he humbly begs\r\n  the favour of Ladies and Gentlemen to try both the Chamber Horses,\r\n  which is the only sure way of having the best. This machine may be of\r\n  great service to children.\r\n\r\nMr Marsh may have been clever at making horses for chamber use, but he\r\ndoesn’t seem to have understood argument much; for whatever pleasure\r\nthere may be in bolting oneself on to a board, and then standing on\r\none’s head, it isn’t much in the way of exercise, even though Fuller may\r\nhave been at the bottom of it. We beg his pardon _on_ it. Still, the\r\nidea is ingenious, and in a population, the majority of which, we are\r\ninformed, consists mainly of fools, would succeed now. From this same\r\n_London Daily Post and General Advertiser_, which is full of strange and\r\nstartling announcements, we take another advertisement, that is likely\r\nto arouse the attention and excite the envy of all who nowadays suffer\r\nfrom those dwellers in tents and other forms of bedsteads, the “mahogany\r\nflats” or Norfolk Howards, who are particularly rapacious in lodgings\r\nwhich are let after a long term of vacancy. This knowledge is the result\r\nof actual experience. The date is March 15, 1740:--\r\n\r\n  MARY SOUTHALL\r\n\r\n  _Successor to_ John Southall, _the first and only person that ever\r\n  found out the nature of_ BUGGS, _Author of the Treatise of those\r\n  nauseous venomous Insects, published with the Approbation (and for\r\n  which he had the honour to receive the unanimous Thanks) of the Royal\r\n  Society_,\r\n\r\n  GIVES NOTICE,\r\n\r\n  THAT since his decease she hath followed the same business, and lives\r\n  at the house of Mrs Mary Roundhall, in Bearlane, Christ Church Parish,\r\n  Southwark. Such quality and gentry as are troubled with buggs, and are\r\n  desirous to be kept free from those vermin, may know, on sending their\r\n  commands to her lodgings aforesaid, when she will agree with them on\r\n  easy terms, and at the first sight will justly tell them which of\r\n  their beds are infested, &c., and which are free, and what is the\r\n  expense of clearing the infested ones, never putting any one to more\r\n  expense than necessary.\r\n\r\n  Persons who cannot afford to pay her price, and is willing to destroy\r\n  them themselves, may by sending notice to her place of abode\r\n  aforesaid, be furnish’d with the NON PAREIL LIQUOR, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nBugs are said to have been very little if at all known in the days of\r\nour ancestors. It is indeed affirmed in that valuable addition to\r\nzoology, Southall’s “Treatise of Bugs” (London, 1730, 8vo), referred to\r\nin the advertisement just quoted, that this insect was scarcely known in\r\nEngland before the year 1670, when it was imported among the timber used\r\nin rebuilding the city of London after the fire of 1666. That it was,\r\nhowever, known much earlier is not to be doubted, though probably it was\r\nfar less common than at present, since Dr Thomas Muffet, in the\r\n“Theatrum Insectorum,” informs us that Dr Penny, one of the early\r\ncompilers of that history of insects, relates his having been sent for\r\nin great haste to Mortlake in Surrey, to visit two noble ladies who\r\nimagined themselves seized with symptoms of the plague; but on Penny’s\r\ndemonstrating to them the true cause of their complaint--viz., having\r\nbeen bitten by those insects, and even detecting them in their\r\npresence--the whole affair was turned into a jest. This was in the year\r\n1583. It is a somewhat remarkable fact, well known to those whose\r\nmisfortunes subject them to contiguity with these highly-scented\r\nbloodsuckers, that within the past few years bugs have altered\r\nconsiderably. The old, nearly round-bellied, and possibly jovial fellow,\r\nhas given way to a long dangerous creature who is known to experts as\r\nthe “omnibus bug,” not so much on account of his impartiality as because\r\nof his shape. It is believed by some that this change is the result of\r\nbugs being discontented with their position, and their natural (and\r\nlaudable) attempt to become something else in accordance with scientific\r\ntheory; but we fancy that the true reason of this change is that foreign\r\nbugs have been imported in large numbers among cargoes, and not\r\ninfrequently about passengers, and that the original settlers are being\r\ngradually exterminated in a manner similar to that which led to the\r\nextirpation of the black rat in this country. There is yet another\r\ntheory with regard to the change which it would be unfair to pass over.\r\nIt is that the bugs have altered--it is admitted on all sides that the\r\nalteration first exhibited itself at the East End of London--in\r\nconsequence of feeding on mixed and barbarous races about Ratcliffe\r\nHighway and other dock purlieus. Any one who pays his money for this\r\nbook is at liberty to take his choice of hypotheses, but we can assure\r\nhim that the change is undoubtedly matter of fact.\r\n\r\nThe next specimen taken is of a literary turn, and appears in the\r\n_Champion, or the Evening Advertiser_, of January 2, 1741. From it we\r\nmay judge of the number of burlesques and travesties which, some large,\r\nsome small, were called into existence by the publication of what many\r\nconsider to be Richardson’s masterpiece. Whatever rank “Pamela” may hold\r\nas compared with “Clarissa Harlowe,” “Sir Charles Grandison,” and other\r\nworks by the same author, it is very little regarded now, while one of\r\nthe books to which it gave rise is now a representative work of English\r\nliterature. Here is the literary advertisement of the day:--\r\n\r\n  _This Day is publish’d_\r\n\r\n  (Price One Shilling and Sixpence),\r\n\r\n  AN APOLOGY for the LIFE of Mrs. SHAMELA ANDREWS, in which the many\r\n  notorious _Falsehoods_ and _Misrepresentations_ of a book called\r\n  _Pamela_ are all expos’d and refuted; and the matchless _Arts_ of that\r\n  young Politician set in a true and just light. Together with a full\r\n  Account of all that passed between her and Parson Arthur Williams,\r\n  whose character is represented in a Manner somewhat different from\r\n  what he bears in _Pamela_, the whole being exact Copies of authentick\r\n  Papers deliver’d to the Editor. Necessary to be had in all Families.\r\n  With a modern Dedication after the Manner of the Antients, especially\r\n  CICERO. By Mr. _Conny Keyber_.\r\n\r\n  Printed for _A. Dodd_, at the Peacock without Temple Bar,\r\n  _Where may be had, Price 1s._,\r\n\r\n  1. The COURT SECRET, a Melancholy Truth. Translated from the Original\r\n  _Arabic_. By an Adept in the Oriental Tongues.\r\n\r\n  _Remember that a Prince’s Secrets are Balm conceal’d;\r\n  But Poison if discover’d._\r\n\r\n  --MASSINGER.\r\n\r\n  _Also, Price 1s.,_\r\n\r\n  2. A Faithful Narrative of the Unfortunate Adventures of _Charles\r\n  Cartwright_, M.D., who in his voyage to _Jamaica_ was taken by a\r\n  Spanish Privateer, and carried into _St Sebastians_. His hard usage\r\n  there, and wonderful Escape from thence, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe “Court Secret” is possibly a satire on the evil doings which were\r\nnotorious in connection with high places at that time, but which happily\r\ndied out with their primary causes; and the other book is doubtless one\r\nof those quaint stories of slavery and adventure which form interesting\r\nreading even to this day. Next we come upon an advertisement which\r\noffers special temptation to the female mind, as it combines the\r\ngratification of more than one ruling passion of the time. It is from\r\nthe _General Advertiser_ of April 27, 1745:--\r\n\r\n  The Interpretation of\r\n  WOMEN’S\r\n  DREAMS,\r\n  With the _Prints_ of these DREAMS finely Engraved.\r\n\r\n  If a _Single_ WOMAN _Dreams_ the 18th DREAM, it tells when she’ll be\r\n  married. If the 19th, she may make her fortune.--The 35th tells what\r\n  children she’ll have. But if she dreams the 34th DREAM\r\n\r\n  She may as well wed FARINELLI, _All one_\r\n  With a curious print of FARINELLI finely engraved,\r\n  Plainly shewing to open and clear view, etc.\r\n  The 42d DREAM describes the man she’s to have, and\r\n  The 33d tells a WIFE also to LOOK ABOUT HER.\r\n  The rest of the DREAMS tell, etc. etc. etc.\r\n\r\n  To which is added A LOTTERY\r\n  For HUSBANDS for young MAIDS,\r\n  With the _Prints_ of these HUSBANDS, Finely Engraved.\r\n  Not one Blank, but ALL Prizes, the _Lowest_ of which\r\n  Is a very _Handsome_ and RICH _Young Gentleman_ that keeps his COACH.\r\n  --And if she draws of the 6th class of _Tickets_, she is then sure to\r\n    be\r\n  MY LADY.\r\n  To be drawn as soon as full--And\r\n  Any Maiden that will put off TWO _Tickets_, shall have ONE for _Her\r\n  Self_ to put her in Fortune’s way.\r\n\r\n  ’Tis GIVEN GRATIS at Mr BURCHELL’S ANODYNE NECKLACE SHOP in Long Acre,\r\n  Cutler and Toyshop. The sign of the case of knives next shop to _Drury\r\n  Lane_,\r\n\r\n    Where _on the counter it does_ Ready _Lie\r\n    For_ ALL _who’ll_ step in _for’t in Passing by_.\r\n\r\nThis Mr Burchell of the Anodyne Necklace was a notorious quack of the\r\ntime, to whom reference is made further on. It is patent to the most\r\ncasual observer that he is able to dispose his wares in the most\r\ntempting manner, and the book, as well as the tickets, must have had a\r\nvery good sale indeed. Also portraying the tastes and peculiarities of\r\nthis portion of the eighteenth century is an invitation taken from the\r\n_General Advertiser_ in October 1745, which displays inordinate vanity\r\non the part of the writer, or, to put it in the mildest form,\r\npeculiarity of behaviour on that of the lady to whom he addresses\r\nhimself:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS a lady last Saturday evening at the playhouse in Drury Lane in\r\n  one of the left-hand boxes, was observed to take particular notice of\r\n  a gentleman who sat about the middle of the pit, and as her company\r\n  would be esteemed the greatest favour, she is humbly desired to send\r\n  him directions, where and in what manner she would be waited upon, and\r\n  direct the said letter to be left for P. M. Z. at the Portugal Coffee\r\n  house near the Exchange.\r\n\r\nNotices of this kind--many of the most barefaced, and not a few of a\r\ndecidedly indelicate description--must have been a fruitful source of\r\nincome to the proprietors of newspapers; and that professions of\r\nadoration for unknown women--most of whom were presumably married, else\r\nwhy all the concealment and strategy?--did not fall off as years\r\nprogressed is shown by the following, taken from a wealth of the same\r\nkind in the commencement of 1748. It is also from the _General\r\nAdvertiser_:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS a young lady was at Covent Garden playhouse last Tuesday\r\n  night, and received a blow with a square piece of wood on her breast;\r\n  if the lady be single and meet me on Sunday at two o’clock, on the\r\n  Mall in St James’s Park, or send a line directed for A. B., to Mr\r\n  Jones’s, at the Sun Tavern at St Paul’s Churchyard, where and when I\r\n  shall wait on her, to inform her of something very much to her\r\n  advantage on honourable terms, her compliance will be a lasting\r\n  pleasure to her most obedient servant.\r\n\r\nThis man, though somewhat rude in his style, and, judging from the\r\ndescription of his adventure at the playhouse, rather coarse in his\r\nmanners, is noticeable for stipulating that his charmer shall be single.\r\nLet us hope that, if his intentions were honourable, he prospered in his\r\nsuit. If he didn’t, then perhaps he felt consoled by the knowledge that\r\nvirtue is its own reward.\r\n\r\n  TO THE JOYOUS.--The Bloods are desired to meet together at the house\r\n  known by the name of the Sir Hugh Middleton, near Saddler’s Wells,\r\n  Islington, which Mr Skeggs has procured for that day for the better\r\n  entertainment of those Gentlemen who agreed to meet at his own house.\r\n  Dinner will be on the Table punctually at two o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe advertisement just given, which appears in the _General Advertiser_\r\nfor January 13, 1748, is one of the rare instances of anything relating\r\nto politics in advertisements. The only time when political significance\r\nis given to an advertisement is when party dinners, of which the\r\nforegoing seems to be one, are advertised. The Sir Hugh Middleton is\r\nstill in existence, and a few years back, when Sadler’s Wells was the\r\nonly home for legitimacy in London, was much frequented by theatrical\r\nstars and the lesser lights of the drama. Comparatively recently a\r\nmusic-hall has been added to the establishment, which, however\r\nprofitable in a pecuniary sense, hardly adds to the reputation of this\r\nwell-known and once suburban tavern. In another preliminary notice,\r\nwhich appears early in April, attention is directed to another part of\r\nthe town, and probably to another phase of political and party\r\nexistence. It is, like the others, from the _General Advertiser_, which\r\nat the time was a great medium. The two which follow it are also from\r\nthe same paper:--\r\n\r\n  HALF-MOON TAVERN, CHEAPSIDE.--Saturday next, the 16 April, being the\r\n  anniversary of the Glorious Battle of Culloden, the Stars will\r\n  assemble in the Moon at six in the evening. Therefore the choice\r\n  spirits are desired to make their appearance and fill up the joy.\r\n\r\nIt is not hard to determine the sentiments of those who then called\r\nCulloden a glorious battle, though we should think there are few\r\nnowadays who, whatever their tastes and sympathies, would affix the\r\nadjective to a victory which, however decisive, was marred by one of the\r\nmost disgraceful and cowardly massacres of any time. But the shame still\r\nrests on the memory of that man who was truly a butcher--a butcher of\r\nthe defenceless, but an impotent officer and arrant coward in the\r\npresence of armed equality; and so, as his name leaves a nasty taste in\r\nthe mouth, we will pass on to a contemporary card put forth by an\r\nenterprising tradesman:--\r\n\r\n  JOHN WARD, STAY-MAKER,\r\n\r\n  AT the Golden Dove, in Hanover Street, Long Acre, Makes Tabby all over\r\n  for £1, 13s. 0d., for large sizes £1, 16s. 0d.; ticken backs £1, 7s.\r\n  0d., for large sizes two or three shillings advance, with the very\r\n  best of goods and the very best of work; neither would I accept a\r\n  ship-load of the second-best bone, and be obliged to use it, to\r\n  deceive people, nor tabby nor trimming. I am willing to produce\r\n  receipts in a court of justice for tabby, bone, &c., and be entirely\r\n  disannulled business, or counted an impostor and a deceiver, if I act\r\n  contrary to what I propose; which if I did I should be guilty of\r\n  nothing but deceit, nor nothing less than fraud, and so don’t ought to\r\n  be allowed; but I can give the direct contrary proofs; for I can prove\r\n  I have had eighteen measures at a time by me since Christmas, for\r\n  people as I have made for several times before, and all the winter\r\n  never less than five or six in a week, often more, all old customers;\r\n  and in consideration its all for ready money, it shows a prodigious\r\n  satisfaction. I buy for ready money, and that commands the best of\r\n  goods, and the allowance made in consideration thereof.\r\n\r\nMr Ward speaks like a conscientious man, but so do most of the\r\nmanufacturers of female apparel--or at least they endeavour to--who\r\nadvertise. The _General Advertiser_ was started in 1745, and its title\r\nindicates the purpose for which it was intended. It was “the first\r\nsuccessful attempt to depend for support upon the advertisements it\r\ncontained, thereby creating a new era in the newspaper press. From the\r\nvery outset its columns were filled with them, between fifty and sixty,\r\nregularly classified and separated by rules, appearing in each\r\npublication; in fact the advertising page put on for the first time a\r\nmodern look. The departure of ships is constantly notified, and the\r\nengravings of these old high-pooped vessels sail in even line down the\r\ncolumn. Trading matters have at last got the upper hand. You see ‘a pair\r\nof leather bags,’ ‘a scarlet laced coat,’ ‘a sword,’ still inquired\r\nafter; and theatres make a show, for this was the dawning of the age of\r\nFoote, Macklin, Garrick, and most of the other great players of the last\r\ncentury; but, comparatively speaking, the gaieties and follies of the\r\ntown ceased gradually from this time to proclaim themselves through the\r\nmedium of advertisements.” The great earthquake at Lisbon so frightened\r\npeople about this time that a law was passed prohibiting masquerades;\r\nand the other means of amusement, the china auctions, the rope-dancing,\r\nthe puppet shows, and the public breakfasts, became scarcer and scarcer\r\nas a new generation sprang into being, and the padded, powdered, and\r\npatched ladies of high descent and doubtful reputation faded from the\r\nworld of fashion. This, however, was a work of time, and the crop of\r\nnoticeable advertisements, though smaller, is still sufficiently large\r\nfor the purpose of making extracts.\r\n\r\nContinuing, then, on our way, we do not travel far from the staymaker’s\r\nannouncement, and are still in the same month, when we drop upon a\r\nnotice which requires no explanation, so well does it apply itself to\r\nthe minds of those whom it may concern. It runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS Ministers of State and other persons in power are often\r\n  importuned for places and preferments which are not in their disposal,\r\n  and whereas many Gentlemen waste their lives and fortunes in a long\r\n  but vain dependance on the Great; This is to give notice, that in\r\n  order to preserve the suitors, on the one hand, from such\r\n  disappointments, and the vexation, expense, and loss of time with\r\n  which they are attended; and men in power, on the other, from being\r\n  solicited on matters not in their department of business:\r\n\r\n  At No. 15, one pair of stairs, in the King’s-bench Walk, in the\r\n  Temple, gentlemen at an easy charge may be informed what is in their\r\n  patrons’ power to bestow, and what with consistency and propriety they\r\n  may ask for; (either civil, ecclesiastical, or military, by land or\r\n  sea, together with the business of each employment, salaries, fees,\r\n  &c.) as also by what methods to apply, and obtain a speedy and\r\n  definite answer.\r\n\r\n  At the same place the most early and certain intelligence may be had\r\n  of the vacancies which occur in all public offices. Those who have any\r\n  business to transact with the Government, may be put into the easiest\r\n  and readiest way to accomplish it, and those who have places to\r\n  dispose of may depend on secrecy and always hear of purchasers.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--At the same place, accompts depending in Chancery, or of any\r\n  other kind, are adjusted; as likewise the business of a money\r\n  scrivener transacted, in buying and selling estates, lending money\r\n  upon proper securities, and proper securities to be had for money.\r\n\r\nThis agency, if properly conducted, must have been as convenient for\r\npatrons as for place applicants, and doubtless the “ministers of State\r\nand other persons in power” must often have been astonished to discover\r\nwhat power they really possessed, which discovery would never have been\r\nmade had it not been for the services of the gentleman up one pair of\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nIn January 1752, the widow Gatesfield discovered the advantage likely\r\nto accrue from the quotation in an advertisement of any independent\r\ntestimony, no matter how remote, and so being anxious to acquaint the\r\npublic with the superiority of the silver spurs, for fighting cocks,\r\nmanufactured at her establishment, she concluded her announcement in the\r\n_Daily Advertiser_ as follows:--\r\n\r\n  ☞ Mr Gatesfield was friend and successor to the late Mr Smith\r\n  mentioned in Mr Hallam’s ingenious poem called the _Cocker_, p. 58.\r\n\r\n    As curious artists different skill disclose,\r\n    The various weapon different temper shows;\r\n    Now curving points to soft a temper bear,\r\n    And now to hard their brittleness declare.\r\n    Now on the plain the treach’rous weapons lye,\r\n    Now wing’d in air the shiver’d fragments fly:\r\n    Surpris’d, chagrin’d, the others gaze,\r\n    And SMITH alone ingenious artist praise.\r\n\r\nThe following, which appears about the same time, is of a rather\r\ndoubtful order. It is inserted in the _General Advertiser_ of January 6,\r\n1752, and seems to be an attempt to renew a friendship broken off by\r\nsome frolicsome fair ones at the sacrifice of as little dignity as\r\npossible. The advertiser certainly seems to know a good deal about the\r\nmissing ladies:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS two young ladies of graceful figure, delicate turned limbs and\r\n  noble aspect, lately absenting themselves from their admirers, are\r\n  suspected maliciously to have sent an expensive Packet, containing\r\n  four indecent Words in various Languages, to a gentleman near Hanover\r\n  Square: This is to give notice whosoever shall induce these ladies to\r\n  surrender themselves to that gentleman, shall receive a suitable\r\n  reward. The ladies may depend on the gentleman’s discretion.\r\n\r\nThe tender honour of the fine gentlemen of sixscore years ago is\r\nadmirably shown by the next two public announcements, the first of which\r\nappears in the _General Advertiser_ for January 13, 1752:--\r\n\r\n  DURING the performance on Saturday night at Drury Lane playhouse, a\r\n  dispute was carried to a great length, between two gentlemen, but all\r\n  the reparation demanded by the injured party being publicly granted,\r\n  the affair had no bad consequences.\r\n\r\nThree days after, the advertisement was repeated in the same paper with\r\nthe addition of some particulars:--\r\n\r\n  DURING the performance on Saturday night at Drury Lane playhouse, a\r\n  dispute was carried to a great length between Mr V----n and a\r\n  gentleman unknown; but on the stranger being made sensible of his\r\n  error, and making public submission and gentleman-like reparation, it\r\n  was amicably terminated.\r\n\r\nMr V----n was evidently very anxious that his friends should know he had\r\nborne himself bravely, and like a gentleman, even at the risk of\r\nbloodshed. Nowadays he would have endeavoured to get his advertisement\r\ninto another portion of the paper, and “Jenkins’s” services and leaded\r\ntype would doubtless have been brought into requisition.\r\n\r\nThe _General Advertiser_ seems to have been a medium for affairs of\r\ngallantry, for just at this period we find the annexed:--\r\n\r\n  A TALL, well-fashion’d, handsome young woman, about eighteen, with a\r\n  fine bloom in her countenance, a cast in one of her eyes, scarcely\r\n  discernable; a well-turned nose, and dark-brown uncurled hair flowing\r\n  about her neck, which seemed to be newly cut; walked last new year’s\r\n  day about three o’clock in the afternoon, pretty fast through Long\r\n  acre, and near the turn into Drury Lane met a young gentleman, wrapp’d\r\n  up in a blue roccelo cloak, whom she look’d at very steadfastly: He\r\n  believes he had formerly the pleasure of her acquaintance: If she will\r\n  send a line directed to H. S. Esq. to be left at the bar of the Prince\r\n  of Orange Coffeehouse, the corner of Pall Mall, intimating where she\r\n  can be spoke with, she will be inform’d of something greatly to her\r\n  advantage. She walked in a dark coloured undressed gown, black hat and\r\n  capuchin; a low middle-aged woman plainly dressed, and a footman\r\n  following close behind, seemed to attend her.\r\n\r\nIt is to be presumed that the hair, and not the neck, is referred to as\r\nbeing newly cut, though at this distance of date it certainly does not\r\nmatter much which, except for the purpose of discovering probable fresh\r\npeculiarities among our very peculiar ancestors. That more than one\r\ncunning tradesman began about now to understand the full value of\r\njudicious puffery, is well shown by the following ingenious\r\nadvertisement, in the form of a letter to the editor of the _General\r\nAdvertiser_, of January 19, 1752, which is a good specimen of that\r\ndisinterested friendship which people always have for themselves:--\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\n  Your inserting this in your paper will be of great service to the\r\n  public, and very much oblige,\r\n\r\n  Your humble servant,\r\n\r\n  E. G.\r\n\r\n  That Mr Parsons, staymaker at the Golden Acorn, James Street, Covent\r\n  Garden, makes stays for those that are crooked, in a perfect easy\r\n  pleasant manner: so that the wearer is as easy in them, though ever so\r\n  crooked, as the straitest woman living, and appears so strait and easy\r\n  a shape that it is not to be perceived by the most intimate\r\n  acquaintances. As to misses that are crooked or inclined to be so,\r\n  either by fall, sickness, etc., he always prevents their growing\r\n  worse, and has often with his care and judgment, in particular methods\r\n  he has in making their coats and stays, brought them intirely strait,\r\n  which I can attest, if required, by several which were infants at my\r\n  boarding School and are now good-shap’d women. I have often persuaded\r\n  Mr Parsons to let this be published in the Papers, for the good of my\r\n  sex, for what would not any gentlewoman give, who has this misfortune,\r\n  either in themselves or their children, to know of a man that can make\r\n  them appear strait and easy, and their children made strait or\r\n  preserved from growing worse. But his answer was that he did not like\r\n  it to be in the Papers; and not only that, but the Public might think\r\n  he work’d only for those who have the misfortune of being crook’d. But\r\n  certainly in mine, and every thinking person’s opinion, as he is so\r\n  ingenious to make such vast additions to a bad shape, he must and can\r\n  add some beauties to a good one by making a genteel stay. He has been\r\n  in business for himself to my knowledge 26 years; consequently has,\r\n  and does work, for genteel shapes as well as bad. I have several\r\n  fine-shaped misses in my School that he works for, whose parents\r\n  always give me thanks for recommending him, and are pleased to say\r\n  that he makes the genteelest stays, robes, or coats they ever saw; and\r\n  I doubt not, but every one that employs him will say the same.\r\n\r\n  Sir, as the publishing this in the Papers (which I acknowledge was\r\n  first without your consent), has been of such universal service,\r\n  therefore I desire you’ll permit the continuance of it, for I\r\n  sincerely do it for the good of my sex, knowing whoever applies to you\r\n  will receive great benefit thereby.\r\n\r\n  ELIZABETH GARDINER.\r\n\r\nMrs Gardiner seems to have known just as much about Mr Parsons as Mr\r\nParsons knew about himself, or at all events as much as he cared to let\r\nother people know. Very different is the next selection, which goes to\r\nshow that however unfashionable a thing love at first sight may be now,\r\nit had some claims to consideration in 1752, from the _Daily Advertiser_\r\nof March 30, in which year, this is taken:--\r\n\r\n  IF the young gentleman who came into the Oratorio last Wednesday and\r\n  by irresistible address gained a place for the lady he attended is yet\r\n  at liberty, Sylvia may still be happy. But, alas! her mind is racked\r\n  when she reflects on all the tender anxiety he discovered (or she\r\n  fears she saw) in all his care of her that evening. How much, how deep\r\n  was all his attention engaged by that too lovely, too happy fair! At\r\n  all events an interview is earnestly sought, even if it be to talk to\r\n  me of eternally lasting sorrow. Notice how to direct to him shall not\r\n  want gratitude. He may remember a circumstance of a lady’s mentioning\r\n  as he passed the sentimental look and sweetness of his eye.\r\n\r\nThere is just a suspicion of humbug about this, unless, indeed, it\r\nemanated from an amorous dame of the Lady Bellaston school, for no young\r\nlady of even those days would have penned such an effusion. Of quite a\r\ndifferent kind is the following, and yet there is a covert satire upon\r\nthe doings of the day in it, which suggests a relationship. It is not\r\nimpossible that both this, which is from the _Daily Advertiser_ of\r\nOctober 27, 1752, and that which precedes it, emanate from the same\r\nsource:--\r\n\r\n  _An Address to the_ GENTLEMEN.\r\n\r\n  _GENTLEMEN_,--It is well known that many of you spare neither pains\r\n  nor cost when in pursuit of a Woman you have a mind to ruin, or when\r\n  attached to one already undone. But I don’t remember to have heard of\r\n  any considerable benevolence conferred by any of you upon a virtuous\r\n  Woman: I therefore take this method to let you know, that if there\r\n  should be any among you who have a desire to assist (with a\r\n  _considerable_ present) an agreeable Woman, for no other reason than\r\n  because she wants it, such Person or Persons (if such there be), may\r\n  by giving their Address in this Paper, be informed of an occasion to\r\n  exercise their disinterested Generosity.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been no hurry on the part of the gentlemen to\r\nrespond to this appeal, which might have stirred the heart of a\r\nknight-errant, but which had no effect on the bloods and fribbles of the\r\nmiddle of last century. In this year 1752, as previously noticed, the\r\nAct was passed forbidding a notification of “no questions asked” in\r\nadvertising lost or stolen property.[33] The _Edinburgh Courant_ of\r\nOctober 28, 1758, supplies us with our next example, and also shows that\r\nthe course of true love was as uneven then as now:--\r\n\r\n  GLASGOW, _Octob. 23, 1758_.\r\n\r\n  WE Robert M‘Nair and Jean Holmes having taken into consideration the\r\n  way and manner our daughter Jean acted in her Marriage, that she took\r\n  none of our advice, nor advised us before she married, for which\r\n  reason we discharged her from our Family, for more than Twelve Months;\r\n  and being afraid that some or other of our Family may also presume to\r\n  marry without duly advising us thereof, We, taking the affair into our\r\n  serious consideration, hereby discharge all and every one of our\r\n  Children from offering to marry without our special advice and consent\r\n  first had and obtained; and if any of our Children should propose or\r\n  presume to offer Marriage to any, without as aforesaid our advice and\r\n  consent, they in that case shall be banished from our Family Twelve\r\n  Months, and if they should go so far as to marry without our advice\r\n  and consent, in that case they are to be banished from the Family\r\n  Seven Years; but whoever advises us of their intention to marry and\r\n  obtains our consent, shall not only remain Children of the Family, but\r\n  also shall have a due proportion of our Goods, Gear, and Estate, as we\r\n  shall think convenient, and as the bargain requires; and further if\r\n  any one of our Children shall marry clandestinely, they, by so doing,\r\n  shall lose all claim or title to our Effects, Goods, Gear or Estate;\r\n  and we intimate this to all concerned, that none may pretend\r\n  ignorance.\r\n\r\nThere is something original about discharging a member of one’s family\r\nfor twelve months or seven years, and then taking her back again; and so\r\nthere is in the idea that all members of this same house are not only\r\nover-anxious to marry, but that they are unduly sought after. The family\r\nmust have been, indeed, a large one to necessitate notification through\r\nthe public press; and though our ignorance may be lamentable, we must\r\nconfess to not knowing why Mrs M‘Nair declined to call herself by her\r\nhusband’s name. We presume--nay, we hope--that Robert and Jean did not\r\nupon principle object to wedlock, though the advertisement, coupled with\r\nthe fact of the dissimilarity of names, might lead any one to suppose\r\nso. Marriage was much thought of in 1758, so far as advertisers are\r\nconcerned, as the following, culled from many of the same kind, which\r\nnow began to appear in the _Daily Advertiser_, will show:--\r\n\r\n  A PERSON of character, candour and honour, who has an entire knowledge\r\n  of the World, and has great Intimacy with both Sexes among the\r\n  Nobility, Gentry and Persons of Credit and Reputation; and as it often\r\n  happens, that many deserving Persons of both Sexes are deprived of the\r\n  opportunity of entering into the state of Matrimony, by being\r\n  unacquainted with the merit of each other, therefore upon directing a\r\n  letter to A. Z. of any one’s intention of entering into the above\r\n  State, to the advantage of each, to be left at Mr Perry’s, Miller’s\r\n  Court, Aldermanbury, Secrecy and Honour will be observed in bringing\r\n  to a Conclusion such their Intention. Any Person who shall send a\r\n  Letter, is desired to order the bearer to put it into the Letter-box\r\n  for fear it may be mislaid: and it is desired that none but those who\r\n  are sincere would make any application on the above subject.\r\n\r\nThat people were, however, quite capable of conducting their own little\r\namours whenever a chance offered, the following, which is another of the\r\nlove-at-first-sight effusions, and a gem in its way, will show. It is\r\nfrom the _London Chronicle_ of August 5, 1758:--\r\n\r\n  A YOUNG LADY who was at Vauxhall on Thursday night last, in company\r\n  with two Gentlemen, could not but observe a young Gentleman in blue\r\n  and a gold-laced hat, who, being near her by the Orchestra during the\r\n  performance, especially the last song, gazed upon her with the utmost\r\n  attention. He earnestly hopes (if unmarried) she will favour him with\r\n  a line directed to A. D. at the bar of the Temple Exchange\r\n  Coffee-house, Temple-bar, to inform him whether Fortune, Family, and\r\n  Character, may not entitle him, upon a further knowledge, to hope an\r\n  interest in her Heart. He begs she will pardon the method he has taken\r\n  to let her know the situation of his Mind, as, being a Stranger, he\r\n  despaired of doing it any other way, or even of seeing her more. As\r\n  his views are founded upon the most honourable Principles, he presumes\r\n  to hope the occasion will justify it, if she generously breaks through\r\n  this trifling formality of the Sex, rather than, by a cruel Silence,\r\n  render unhappy one, who must ever expect to continue so, if debarred\r\n  from a nearer acquaintance with her, in whose power alone it is to\r\n  complete his Felicity.\r\n\r\nThis goes to prove what we have before remarked, that the concocters of\r\nthese advertisements were in the habit of falling in love with the women\r\nwhom they saw with other men; and so it is only natural to suppose, that\r\nhowever honourable they may have protested themselves in print, they\r\nwere in reality mean, cowardly, and contemptible. The well-known Kitty\r\nFisher finds the utility of advertising as a means of clearing her\r\ncharacter, and in the _Public Advertiser_ of March 30, 1759, puts forth\r\nthe following petition, which had little effect upon her persecutors, as\r\nthe little scribblers continued, as little scribblers will even\r\nnowadays, and “scurvy malevolence” also held sway over her destinies for\r\na considerable period:--\r\n\r\n  TO err is a blemish entailed upon Mortality, and Indiscretions seldom\r\n  or ever escape from Censure; the more heavy as the Character is more\r\n  remarkable; and doubled, nay trebled, by the World, if the progress of\r\n  that Character is marked by Success; then Malice shoots against it\r\n  all her stings, the snakes of Envy are let loose; to the human and\r\n  generous Heart then must the injured appeal, and certain relief will\r\n  be found in impartial Honour. Miss Fisher is forced to sue to that\r\n  jurisdiction to protect her from the baseness of little Scribblers and\r\n  scurvy Malevolence; she has been abused in public Papers, exposed in\r\n  Printshops, and to wind up the whole, some Wretches, mean, ignorant\r\n  and venal, would impose upon the Public by daring to pretend to\r\n  publish her Memoirs. She hopes to prevent the success of their\r\n  endeavours by thus publicly declaring that nothing of that sort has\r\n  the slightest foundation in Truth.\r\n\r\n  C. FISHER.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to an article written by Dr Johnson, in an\r\n_Idler_ of 1759, on the subject of advertisements. It is very amusing,\r\nand in it he says that “whatever is common is despised. Advertisements\r\nare now so numerous that they are very negligently perused, and it is\r\ntherefore become necessary to gain attention by magnificence of\r\npromises, and by eloquence sometimes sublime and sometimes pathetic.” He\r\nthen passes in review some of the most inflated puffs of that period,\r\nand continues: “Promise, large promise, is the soul of an advertisement.\r\nI remember a washball that had a quality truly wonderful--it gave an\r\nexquisite edge to the razor. And there are now to be sold, for ready\r\nmoney only, some duvets for bed-coverings, of down, beyond comparison\r\nsuperior to what is called ottar down, and indeed such, that its many\r\nexcellences cannot be here set forth. With one excellence we are made\r\nacquainted--it is warmer than four or five blankets, and lighter than\r\none. There are some, however, that know the prejudice of mankind in\r\nfavour of modest sincerity. The vendor of the beautifying fluid sells a\r\nlotion that repels pimples, washes away freckles, smooths the skin, and\r\nplumps the flesh; and yet, with a generous abhorrence of ostentation,\r\nconfesses that it will not restore the bloom of fifteen to a lady of\r\nfifty. The true pathos of advertisements must have sunk deep into the\r\nheart of every man that remembers the zeal shown by the seller of the\r\nanodyne necklace, for the ease and safety of poor toothing infants, and\r\nthe affection with which he warned every mother, that she would never\r\nforgive herself if her infant should perish without a necklace. I cannot\r\nbut remark to the celebrated author, who gave, in his notifications of\r\nthe camel and dromedary, so many specimens of the genuine sublime, that\r\nthere is now arrived another subject yet more worthy of his pen--A\r\nfamous Mohawk Indian warrior, who took Dieskaw, the French general,\r\nprisoner, dressed in the same manner with the native Indians when they\r\ngo to war, with his face and body painted, with his scalping knife,\r\ntom-axe, and all other implements of war! A sight worthy the curiosity\r\nof every true Briton! This is a very powerful description: but a critic\r\nof great refinement would say that it conveys rather horror than terror.\r\nAn Indian, dressed as he goes to war, may bring company together; but if\r\nhe carries the scalping knife and tom-axe, there are many true Britons\r\nthat will never be persuaded to see him but through a grate. It has been\r\nremarked by the severer judges, that the salutary sorrow of tragic\r\nscenes is too soon effaced by the merriment of the epilogue: the same\r\ninconvenience arises from the improper disposition of advertisements.\r\nThe noblest objects may be so associated as to be made ridiculous. The\r\ncamel and dromedary themselves might have lost much of their dignity\r\nbetween the true flower of mustard and the original Daffy’s Elixir; and\r\nI could not but feel some indignation when I found this illustrious\r\nIndian warrior immediately succeeded by a fresh parcel of Dublin butter.\r\nThe trade of advertising is now so near to perfection, that it is not\r\neasy to propose any improvement. But as every art ought to be exercised\r\nin due subordination to the public good, I cannot but propose it as a\r\nmoral question to these masters of the public ear, Whether they do not\r\nsometimes play too wantonly with our passions? as when the registrar of\r\nlottery tickets invites us to his shop by an account of the prizes which\r\nhe sold last year; and whether the advertising controversists do not\r\nindulge asperity of language without any adequate provocation? as in\r\nthe dispute about strops for razors, now happily subsided, and in the\r\naltercation which at present subsists concerning Eau de Luce. In an\r\nadvertisement it is allowed to every man to speak well of himself, but I\r\nknow not why he should assume the privilege of censuring his neighbour.\r\nHe may proclaim his own virtue or skill, but ought not to exclude others\r\nfrom the same pretensions. Every man that advertises his own excellence\r\nshould write with some consciousness of a character which dares to call\r\nthe attention of the public. He should remember that his name is to\r\nstand in the same paper with those of the King of Prussia and the\r\nEmperor of Germany, and endeavour to make himself worthy of such\r\nassociation. Some regard is likewise to be paid to posterity. There are\r\nmen of diligence and curiosity who treasure up the papers of the day\r\nmerely because others neglect them, and in time they will be scarce.\r\nWhen these collections shall be read in another century, how will\r\nnumberless contradictions be reconciled; and how shall fame be possibly\r\ndistributed among the tailors and bodice-makers of the present age?”\r\nJudging by the advertisements which continued, the worthy advertisers of\r\n1759 had a very poor opinion of men yet to come, and might have asked,\r\nhad they thought of it, with the Irish member, “What’s posterity ever\r\ndone for us?”--a query which would have puzzled even Dr Johnson.\r\n\r\nThe short-sleeved dresses of 1760 must have called for all kinds of\r\napparatus for whitening and beautifying the arms, and among many a\r\nkindred and attractive advertisement of the time we take the following\r\nfrom the _Chronicle_ of April 19-21:--\r\n\r\n  _Gloves for Ladies._\r\n\r\n  THE true prepared French Chicken and Dog-skin Gloves, for clearing and\r\n  whitening the hands and arms, perfumed and plain. As some ladies have\r\n  had but small confidence in these Gloves, till they have been\r\n  prevailed upon to wear one Glove for eight or ten Nights, when they\r\n  have evidently seen to their agreeable satisfaction that hand and arm\r\n  brought to such a superior degree of whiteness over the other, as\r\n  though they did not belong to the same Person.\r\n\r\n  The above Gloves are prepared and sold only by Warren & Co.,\r\n  Perfumers, at the Golden Fleece, in Marybone Street, Golden Square, at\r\n  5s. a pair, who import, make and sell, all sorts of perfumery Goods,\r\n  in the utmost perfection. The Violet-Cream Pomatum, and celebrated\r\n  quintessence of Lavender, by no other person.\r\n\r\n  ☞ Ladies sending their servants are humbly desired to send a Glove of\r\n  the size.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--Just landed, a fine parcel of the famous _India_ Pearl.\r\n\r\n  ⁂ The Queen’s Royal Marble, at 20s., and Chinese Imperial Wash ball,\r\n  at 5s., that are so well known to the Nobility, &c. Ladies’ Masks and\r\n  Tippets.\r\n\r\nAll this effort at decoration and beautifying is very wrong, but we are\r\nstopped in our desire to “improve the occasion” by the recollection that\r\nno age has been more deep in the mysteries of cosmetic, enamel, pearl\r\npowder, and paint than our own, in which quacks abound, and old ladies\r\nhave been known to submit themselves to the operation of being made\r\nbeautiful, not for all time, but for ever. A little further on, in the\r\n_Evening Post_, we come upon an ambitious author who has attempted to\r\nregenerate the drama, and who advertises his work. Shakespeare seems\r\nalways to have been considered capable of improvement by somebody, but\r\nas the mania for touching the immortal bard up, and making him\r\nrespectable and fit for the understandings of small tradesmen, still\r\ngoes on, and fortunes are made at it, we will give the following without\r\ncomment, lest some original author of the present day might think we\r\nwere obliquely alluding to him:--\r\n\r\n  _In the press and shortly will be published_\r\n\r\n  THE Students, a Comedy, altered from Shakespeare’s Love’s Labour Lost,\r\n  and adapted to the stage, with an original Prologue and Epilogue.\r\n\r\n  Printed for Thomas Hope, opposite the north gate of the Royal\r\n  Exchange, Threadneedle St.\r\n\r\nDeserters are plentiful about this period, our soldiers, however brave\r\nthey may have been when put to it, having an evident objection to the\r\npomp and circumstance of war. That was, perhaps, because their share of\r\nthe latter was unduly large as compared with their participation in the\r\nformer. The following is from _Lloyd’s Evening Post_ of April 26-28, and\r\nis a fair specimen of the remainder:--\r\n\r\n  _Deserted_\r\n\r\n  FROM the 16th Regiment of Dragoons, Captain Walmesly’s troop,\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM BEVEN,\r\n\r\n  Aged 16 years, about five feet five inches high, stoops a good deal as\r\n  he walks, and but very indifferently made; absented himself from his\r\n  Quarters last Saturday night, the 17th instant; he says he was born in\r\n  the parish of the _Hays_, in the County of Brecknockshire, and by\r\n  trade a labourer; he went away with a light horse man’s cap, a coarse\r\n  red frock faced with black, a striped flannel waistcoat, and a pair of\r\n  leather breeches.\r\n\r\n  Whoever apprehends and secures the above Deserter, so as he may be\r\n  committed to any of His Majesty’s gaols, shall, by applying to George\r\n  Ross, Esq., Agent to the regiment, in Conduit Street, London, receive\r\n  twenty Shillings, over and above the reward given by Act of\r\n  Parliament.\r\n\r\nThose who are in the habit of expressing themselves as to the decadence\r\nof the British soldier, and of the British human being generally, will\r\ndo well to ponder over this advertisement, and judge from it the\r\ndifference between the defenders of hearths and homes of then and now.\r\nYet, with all his want of size and possession of awkwardness, this same\r\nyouth, who would not nowadays be admitted into the worst regiment of\r\nmilitia fallbacks in existence, is deemed worthy of an extra reward. So\r\nmuch for “our army” in the middle of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n  [33] This Act seems to have been forgotten, or capable of evasion, for\r\n  a statute of the 7 & 8 Geo. IV., c. 29, s. 59, imposes a penalty on\r\n  any person who shall advertise, or print, or publish an advertisement\r\n  of a reward for the return of property stolen or lost, with words\r\n  purporting that no questions shall be asked, or promising to\r\n  pawnbrokers or others the return of money which may have been lent\r\n  upon objects feloniously acquired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n_THE EDUCATION COMPLETED._\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, as has been shown, advertisements have had to struggle against\r\nforeign war, internecine disorder, the poverty of the State, and many\r\nother drawbacks; but by the commencement of the seventh decade of the\r\neighteenth century, these difficulties have all in turn been surmounted,\r\nand the most modern means of obtaining publicity, despite prejudice,\r\nand, still worse, taxation, is fixed firmly in the land, and doing much\r\ntowards the management of its affairs. The country is at peace with the\r\nworld, so far as Europe is concerned; and even the Canadian campaign is\r\nas good as over. Clive has made himself felt and the name of England\r\nfeared throughout the length and breadth of India, and merchants are\r\nbeginning to reap the advantages of conquest. George III. has ascended\r\nthe throne, has been married and crowned, and looks forward to a long\r\nand prosperous reign. In fact, everything seems bright and smiling, for\r\nnever, through many a long year, was the country so free from troubles\r\nand anxieties, or with so little to direct her attention from those two\r\ngreat essentials to English existence--profit and pleasure. And so, as\r\nmarked in the preceding chapter, advertisements of all kinds progressed\r\nas the century became older; and when the ordinary style failed, dodges\r\nof all kinds were adopted to give a factitious importance to\r\nannouncements, no matter whether of quacks, of publishers, or of the\r\ninfinite variety of other trades and professions which just now began to\r\nbe bitten by the fast-growing mania. Some of the sly puffs were of a\r\nmost specious order, and attention is called to one of them by the\r\nindignation it evoked in the _Monthly Review_ (vol. xxvii. 1762). The\r\nobject of the puff paragraph had been an insipid panegyric on Lord\r\nHalifax, called “The Minister of State,” which sacrificed on the altar\r\nof Halifax the characters of all preceding premiers, from Burleigh to\r\nBute, and the attempt to force its sale evoked the wrath of the\r\n_Review_, which commences as follows:--“As the practice of puffing is\r\nnow arrived at the utmost height of assurance, it will not be improper\r\nfor the Reviewers occasionally to mark some of the grosser instances\r\nthat may occur of this kind.” Thereupon it notices the “lying\r\nparagraph,” to which we have already referred, the words within brackets\r\nbeing the comments of the Reviewer:\r\n\r\n  A noble Peer has absolutely given directions to his Solicitor to\r\n  commence a Prosecution against the Author of the Poem called, _The\r\n  Minister of State, a Satire_, as a most licentious and libellous\r\n  composition.--The writer, no doubt, merits a severer censure of the\r\n  Law than any of his brethren, because instead of employing those\r\n  _great talents for poetry and satire for which he is so deservedly\r\n  celebrated_ [what does he not deserve for his effrontery?] in the\r\n  service of Virtue and his Country, he has _basely_ [basely enough!]\r\n  prostituted them to the unworthy purpose of defaming, lampooning and\r\n  abusing some of the greatest characters in this Kingdom. [All a puff\r\n  to excite curiosity.] We think this LITERARY LUMINARY, of the age\r\n  [this illiterate farthing candle!] should pay a greater deference to\r\n  the words of his predecessor Mr Pope:\r\n\r\n  “Curs’d be the verse, how smooth soe’er it flow,” etc.\r\n\r\n  [We doubt, however, if any of this _honest_ gentleman’s readers will\r\n  think his verses worth a curse, whatever they may think he deserves\r\n  for his impudence.]\r\n\r\nThis energetic effort on the part of the _Review_ to prevent undue\r\nreputations being made by disguised advertisements, had little effect in\r\nchecking an evil which flourishes unto this day--which will, in fact,\r\nflourish as long as a majority exist ready to believe anything they are\r\ntold, and to be more than usually prompt with their credulity when what\r\nthey are told is more than usually wrong. The next notification we\r\nselect is from the _British Chronicle_ of January 4-6, 1762, and is of\r\na literary character also, though, judging by the motto adopted, the\r\nwork is more likely to produce melancholy than amusement:--\r\n\r\n  This day are published, Price 1s.,\r\n\r\n  THE Songs of Selma, attempted in English verse, from the original of\r\n  Ossian, the son of Fingal. . . . . _Quis talia fando Tempenet a\r\n  lacrymis?_. . . . Printed for R. Griffiths, opposite Somerset House in\r\n  the Strand; C. Henderson, at the Royal Exchange; and G. Woodfall,\r\n  Charing Cross.\r\n\r\nHow many books of this kind have been published, thrown aside, and\r\nforgotten, or consigned to the pastrycook and trunkmaker, since the\r\n“Songs of Selma” saw the light, is a question easier to ask than to\r\nsolve. One thing is, though, certain--the number of people who will\r\nwrite, whether they have anything to say or not, increases every year,\r\nand in due course we may expect an ingenious Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nto impose a tax on authors; which, after all, will hardly, so far as\r\nbrilliancy is concerned, be so destructive as the window-tax, or so\r\nuncalled for as Mr Robert Lowe’s famous “ex luce lucellum” imposition. A\r\ncouple of weeks later, in the same paper (January 18-20), is the\r\nfollowing of a very different character from that which has been already\r\nselected:--\r\n\r\n  READING MACHINE\r\n\r\n  IS removed from the Three Kings, Piccadilly, to the George Inn, Snow\r\n  Hill, London; sets out from the _Broad Face, Reading_, every Monday,\r\n  Wednesday, and Friday, at seven o’clock in the morning, and from the\r\n  _George Inn, Snow Hill_, every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, at\r\n  seven o’clock in the morning; carries passengers to and from Reading\r\n  at 6s. each, children in lap, and outside passengers at 3s.\r\n\r\n  Performed by {THOMAS MOORE and\r\n               {RICHARD MAPLETON.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--Takes no charge of Writings, Money, Watches, or Jewels, unless\r\n  entered and paid for as such.\r\n\r\nThis machine was evidently a nondescript, partly slow coach, partly\r\nwaggon, and was extremely reasonable in its rates if it journeyed at any\r\npace, seeing that outside passengers paid no more than present\r\nParliamentary rates, while the insides had no occasion to complain of\r\nexcessive expenditure. But fancy the journey at seven o’clock on a\r\nJanuary morning, with the knowledge that no brisk motion would keep the\r\nblood in circulation, that the roads were heavy, the weather\r\nindifferent, the society worse, the conversation, if any, very heavy,\r\nand the purse proportionally light! Such a company as Roderick Random\r\nand Strap fell in with in the waggon, must often have been seen on the\r\noutside of the Reading Machine. In the same paper of January 20-22, we\r\nfind the advertisement of a pamphlet issued for the gratification of a\r\nmorbid taste which has its representative nowadays--though, by the way,\r\nthere is more excuse for a little excitement over murder and execution\r\nnow than there was in the days when every week saw its batch of\r\ncriminals led forth to take their final dance upon nothing:--\r\n\r\n  This day was published, price 1s.,\r\n\r\n  SOME authentic particulars of the life of John Macnaghton, Esq., of\r\n  Ben ----, who was executed in Ireland, on tuesday the 25th day of\r\n  December, for the Murder of Miss Mary Anne Knox, the only daughter of\r\n  Andrew Knox, Esq., of Prehen, representative in the late and present\r\n  Parliament for the county of Donegal. With a full account of his\r\n  pretended Connexion with the young Lady; of the measures he took to\r\n  seize her person previous to the Murder; the circumstances of that\r\n  fact; the manner of his being apprehended; and his conduct and\r\n  behaviour from that time till his Death. Compiled from papers\r\n  communicated by a gentleman in Ireland, to a person of distinction of\r\n  that Kingdom now residing here.\r\n\r\n  Printed for H. Payne & W. Croply, at Dryden’s Head in Paternoster Row.\r\n\r\nJohn Macnaghton, Esq., was a real gentleman criminal, and though food\r\nfor the halter was plenty in 1762 and thereabouts, gentlemen were\r\n“tucked up” still more rarely than within ordinary recollections; for\r\nstern as was the law a hundred years ago, it had very merciful\r\nconsideration for persons of quality, and the hanging of a landed\r\nproprietor for a mere paltry murder was a very noticeable event. In the\r\n_London Gazette_ of February 23-27, we find a record of the coronation\r\nof their illustrious and sacred Majesties, George and Charlotte, which\r\nruns thus:--\r\n\r\n  ALBEMARLE ST., _Feby. 26, 1762_.\r\n\r\n  THE Gold Medals intended for the Peers and Peeresses who in their\r\n  robes attended at the Coronation of their Majesties (according to a\r\n  list obtained from the proper officers) will be delivered at the Earl\r\n  of Powis’s house in Albemarle Street, on Wednesday and Thursday next,\r\n  from ten to twelve o’clock each day.\r\n\r\n  It is therefore desired that the Peers and Peeresses, as above\r\n  mentioned, will send for their Medals; and that the persons who shall\r\n  be sent for them shall bring Cards, signed by such Peers or Peeresses,\r\n  as the Medals shall be required for, and sealed with their Arms.\r\n\r\nIn the same paper we come upon the advertisement of a book which is even\r\nnow read with interest, though the price at which a modern issue of it\r\nis offered is ludicrously small compared with that of the original\r\nedition:--\r\n\r\n  THIS day is published, in small quarto, Price Thirty Shillings,\r\n  Printed at Strawberry Hill, Anecdotes of Painting in England, with\r\n  incidental Notes on other Arts. Collected by the late Mr George\r\n  Vertue, and now first digested and published from his original\r\n  Manuscripts. By Mr Horace Walpole. Vol. I. and II. With above forty\r\n  Copper plates, four of which are taken from antient Paintings; the\r\n  rest, heads of Artists, engraved by Grignion, Muller, Chambers, and\r\n  Bannerman.\r\n\r\n  To be had of W. Bathoe, Bookseller, in the Strand, near Exeter\r\n  Exchange.\r\n\r\nAs we have no wish whatever to paint the lily, we will, although the\r\nsubject is a kindred one, leave Horace Walpole’s book without a fresh\r\ncriticism to add to the thousand and odd already passed upon it, and\r\nwill pass on to the land “where the men are all brave and the women all\r\nbeautiful,” and where, in _Faulkner’s Dublin Journal_, also of February\r\n1762, we come upon the cry of a young man for his mother. In the\r\nadvertisement is the nucleus of a story quite equal to “Tom Jones,”\r\nprovided, of course, that its author possessed the fancy of a Fielding.\r\nWe are not aware of any literary gentleman who would succeed, though we\r\nare acquainted with plenty who would most confidently make the attempt;\r\ntheir only doubt, if doubt possessed them at all, being not in their own\r\npowers, but in the discernment of the reading public. To them,\r\ntherefore, we present the groundwork of a story which would naturally\r\nenlist the sympathies of England and Ireland. A little might also be\r\nthrown in for the benefit of Scotland, which would hardly like to be\r\nleft out of so fascinating a romance:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS a lady who called herself a native of Ireland was in England\r\n  in the year 1740, and resided some time at a certain village near\r\n  Bath, where she was delivered of a son, whom she left with a sum of\r\n  money under the care of a person in the same parish, and promised to\r\n  fetch him at a certain age, but has not since been heard of; now this\r\n  is to desire the lady, if living, and this should be so fortunate as\r\n  to be seen by her, to send a letter, directed to T. E. to be left at\r\n  the Chapter Coffee house, St Paul’s Churchyard, London, wherein she is\r\n  desired to give an account of herself, and her reasons for concealing\r\n  this affair: or if the lady should be dead, and any person is privy to\r\n  the affair, they are likewise desired to direct as above.--_N.B._ This\r\n  advertisement is published by the person himself, not from motives of\r\n  necessity, or to court any assistance (he being, by a series of happy\r\n  circumstances, possessed of an easy and independent fortune) but with\r\n  a real desire to know his origin.--_P.S._ The strictest secrecy may be\r\n  depended on.\r\n\r\nFoundlings seem to have been better off a hundred years ago than now,\r\nfor in all stories they come out very well, and in this present instance\r\nT. E. seems to have been able to help himself. It is not unlikely,\r\nhowever, that some sharp adventurer, knowing how weak is human nature,\r\nhad hit upon the expedient of attracting maternal sympathies--Bath was a\r\ngreat place at that time for interesting invalids--with a view to a\r\nsystem of extortion. This may, or may not be, and at this distance of\r\ntime it is useless to speculate. Accordingly we turn once more to the\r\n_London Gazette_, and in a number for April 1762 find this:--\r\n\r\n  THE following persons being fugitives for debt, and beyond the seas,\r\n  on or before the twenty-fifth day of October, one thousand seven\r\n  hundred and sixty, and having surrendered themselves to the Gaolers\r\n  or Keepers of the respective Prisons or Gaols hereafter mentioned, do\r\n  hereby give notice, that they intend to take the benefit of an Act of\r\n  Parliament passed in the first year of the reign of His present\r\n  Majesty King George the Third, intituled _An Act for relief of\r\n  Insolvent Debtors_, at the next General or Quarter Sessions of the\r\n  Peace, to be held in and for the County, Riding, Division, City, Town,\r\n  Liberty or Place, or any adjournment thereof, which shall happen next\r\n  after thirty days from the first Publication of the undermentioned\r\n  names, viz.,\r\n\r\n  James Colburn, late of Smith Street, in the parish of St James, in the\r\n  county of Middlesex, Baker.\r\n\r\n  Fugitive surrendered to the Keeper of Whitechapel Prison, in the\r\n  County of Middlesex.\r\n\r\n  Second Notice.\r\n\r\n  Charles Watkins, late of the Bankside, in the parish of St Saviour,\r\n  Southwark, in the county of Surrey, Waterman.\r\n\r\n  Fugitive surrendered to the Keeper of the Poultry Compter, in the City\r\n  of London.\r\n\r\n  Third Notice.\r\n\r\n  James Buckley, formerly of Cock Alley, late of Star Alley, in the\r\n  Parish of Aldgate, Lower Precinct, London, Cordwainer.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the first notices given of an intention to take the\r\nbenefit of an Act that was much wanted. The slowness of people to take\r\nadvantage of any boon, no matter how priceless, is here once again\r\nshown, for there are but three claimants for redemption, two of whom had\r\nbeen published before. By the middle of 1762 the Cock Lane ghost had had\r\nits two years’ run and was discovered, and it must have been just about\r\nthe time of the trial of Parsons and his family--viz., in June--that the\r\nfollowing appeared in the _British Chronicle_:--\r\n\r\n  This day is published, price 6d.\r\n\r\n  A TRUE account of the several conversations between the supposed\r\n  Apparition in Cock Lane, and the Gentlemen who attended. Together with\r\n  the Death and Funeral of Mrs K----, and many other circumstances not\r\n  made known to the World.\r\n\r\n  Published for the conviction of the incredulous.\r\n\r\n  “I would take the ghost’s word for a thousand pounds.”\r\n\r\n  HAMLET.\r\n\r\n  Printed for E. Cabe, at his Circulating library in Ave Marie lane; and\r\n  to be had of all Pamphlet shops and News carriers.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to tell whether the writer is in favour of the ghost’s\r\nexistence or not from the advertisement, for while he in one breath\r\nspeaks of the supposed apparition, he immediately afterwards refers to\r\nthe incredulous, and quotes no less an authority than Shakespeare in\r\nsupport of the imposition. Doubtless this was a trick to secure the\r\npurchase-money, if not the support, of the partisans of both sides.\r\nNext, in the same paper, we come upon a notice of the post-office in\r\nreference to the foreign mails of that day, which runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  GENERAL POST OFFICE, _Aug. 8, 1762_.\r\n\r\n  PUBLIC Notice is hereby given to all persons corresponding with His\r\n  Majesty’s island of Belleisle, that Letters for the future will be\r\n  regularly forwarded from Plymouth to and from that Island, by two\r\n  Vessels, lately hired and appointed for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  By Order of the Postmaster-General,\r\n\r\n  HENRY POTTS, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\nThe mail service across the Atlantic was somewhat different in 1762 from\r\nwhat it is now, when a continuous stream of letters is every day poured\r\nforth, either by way of Liverpool or by means of the later delivery at\r\nQueenstown. Soldiers seem to have been shorter, too, not only in height\r\nbut in quantity, about this time, if the evidence of an advertisement of\r\nJanuary 1, 1763, is to be taken. We are still quoting from the _British\r\nChronicle_, and shall continue to do so until another journal is\r\nnamed:--\r\n\r\n  THE Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, commanded by the Right Honourable\r\n  the Marquis of Granby, is willing to entertain any young Man under 23\r\n  years of age, having a good Character, strait and well made, in height\r\n  from five feet ten, to six feet one inch. Apply to Quarter Master\r\n  _Campbell_, at the Market Coffee House, Mayfair.\r\n\r\nFrom the same copy we take another notice, which shows that the\r\nexecutors of Mr Ward not only considered it their duty to get rid of his\r\nstock at the best possible advantage, but also to continue a defence of\r\nthe business which had been instituted by the late proprietor against\r\nthe attacks of an impostor. The reason they give for the republication\r\nis curious, unless they fancied its omission would trouble the spirit of\r\nthe late compounder of drugs:--\r\n\r\n  THE late Joshua Ward of Whitehall, Esq., having left very considerable\r\n  quantities of his principal Medicines ready prepared, such and such\r\n  only as may be applied for by name, will be delivered at his late\r\n  dwelling-house in Whitehall.\r\n\r\n  As not the least pretence is made by us, of having any judgment in the\r\n  application of Medicine, we presume to say no more than that the\r\n  specified orders shall be delivered with the utmost care and\r\n  fidelity.--Ralph Ward, Thomas Ward, Executors.\r\n\r\n  As the following was published by the late Mr Ward it is necessary to\r\n  adjoin the same.--“Having seen in the public papers that a woman\r\n  servant discharged from my service advertises herself as (late) my\r\n  housekeeper and assistant in preparing my medicines. It is a justice I\r\n  owe the public and myself, to declare, that this woman was hired and\r\n  lived with me as, and at the wages of a common working servant,\r\n  keeping no other. And as to what knowledge she may have in preparing\r\n  my medicines, every living servant in my family, with the same\r\n  propriety, may pretend to it, being all assistants to me by their\r\n  manual labour. Signed--Joshua Ward.”\r\n\r\nSoon after this, February 10-12, comes an announcement which must have\r\nfilled the lady readers of the _Chronicle_--for ladies ever loved\r\nbargains--with anxiety and their husbands with terror. The last\r\nparagraph shows that the warehouseman knew well how to bait his trap for\r\nthe unwary:--\r\n\r\n  A REAL SALE OF SILKS\r\n\r\n  AT the Coventry Cross, Chandos Street, Covent Garden. Consisting of a\r\n  very great assortment of Rich brocades, Tissues, flowered and plain\r\n  Sattins, Tabbies, Ducapes, black Armozeens, Rasdumores, Mantuas, &c.\r\n  Being purchased of the executors of an eminent weaver and factor,\r\n  deceased, and of another left off trade.\r\n\r\n  Merchants, &c., may be supplied with rich Silks fit for exportation,\r\n  fresh and fine patterns, greatly under prime cost, for ready money\r\n  only, the price marked on each piece.\r\n\r\n  It is hoped Ladies will not be offended that they cannot possibly be\r\n  waited on at their own Houses.\r\n\r\nWithin a very short period, little more than a week, we come across an\r\nadvertisement which we admit fairly puzzles us. We are certainly far\r\nmore able to believe that the precious balsam does all that is promised\r\nfor it, than we are to understand the reason for its having but one\r\ntitle. It runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  WARHAM’S Apoplectic Balsam, so well known as an excellent remedy\r\n  against Fits, Convulsions, &c., cures Deafness, bad Humours in the\r\n  Eyes, inward Bruises, dissolves hard Lumps in the Breast, and has\r\n  often cured Cancers, as can be proved by Facts; is a sovereign salve\r\n  for green Wounds, Burns, &c. Is prepared and sold only by W. Strode,\r\n  at the Golden Ball, Tottenham Court Road, London.\r\n\r\n  Who also prepares and sells Warham’s Cephalick Snuff, of a most\r\n  grateful smell, and an effectual remedy for giddiness, nervous pains\r\n  in the Head, &c.\r\n\r\n  Also Warham’s excellent Mouth water, which certainly cures the\r\n  toothache, strengthens and preserves the Teeth, takes off all smells\r\n  proceeding from bad Teeth, &c.\r\n\r\nIn a number for February 26 to March 1, 1764, there is an announcement\r\nof one of those dinners without which no English charity ever has\r\nsucceeded, or, so long as English nature remains as it is, ever will\r\nsucceed without. It is noticeable for various reasons, and especially\r\nfor the notices of “Mr” Handel and the airing of the hall:--\r\n\r\n  MAGDALEN HOUSE CHARITY.\r\n\r\n  Prescot Street, Goodman’s Fields, Feb. 10, 1764.\r\n\r\n  THE Anniversary Feast of the Governors of this Charity will be held on\r\n  Thursday the 18th of March next, at Drapers-Hall, in Throgmorton\r\n  Street, after a sermon to be preached at the Parish Church of St\r\n  George, Hanover Square, before the Right Honourable the Earl of\r\n  Hertford, President; the Vice-Presidents; Treasurer and Governor of\r\n  this Charity; by the Rev. William Dodd, A.M., Chaplain to the Bishop\r\n  of St David’s.\r\n\r\n  Prayers will begin at eleven o’clock precisely, and Dinner will be on\r\n  table at Three o’clock.\r\n\r\n  Stewards.\r\n\r\n  The Right Hon. Lord Viscount Spencer.\r\n  The Right Hon. Lord Scarsdale.\r\n\r\n  Joseph Martin, Esq.\r\n  John Weyland, Esq.\r\n  John Barker, Esq.\r\n  John Eddows, Esq.\r\n  John Smith, Esq.\r\n  Jacob Wilkinson, Esq.\r\n  John Lefevre, Esq.\r\n  Jacob Bosanquet, Esq.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--A Te Deum, composed by Mr Handel for the late Duke of\r\n  Chandos’s Chapel, with Jubilate and other Anthems, will be performed\r\n  by Mr Beard, and a proper Band of the best performers, both vocal and\r\n  instrumental.\r\n\r\n  The Hall will be properly aired.\r\n\r\n  Tickets for the Feast may be had at the following places, at five\r\n  shillings each, viz., Mr Winterbottom’s, the Secretary, in Old Broad\r\n  Street, and at the following Coffee-Houses; Arthur’s, in St James’s\r\n  Street; Mount’s, Grosvenor Square; Tom’s, in Devereux Court;\r\n  Richard’s, in Fleet Street; Tom’s, John’s, and Batoon’s, in Cornhill;\r\n  and Waghorn’s, at the Court of Requests.\r\n\r\n  Two ladies Tickets for the Church will be given\r\n  with each Feast Ticket.\r\n\r\nMr Gibson, whose advertisement appears in the edition for April 5-7,\r\n1764, would have been invaluable to Julia Pastrana and the Bearded Lady,\r\nwhile his aid would have been equally in demand among those anxious to\r\ncover themselves with the glory of hirsute appendages. Unfortunately for\r\nhim, moustaches and beards were not then in demand, nor was baldness so\r\nnoticeable as now; but the request for his beautifying paste doubtless\r\ncompensated him for other neglects:--\r\n\r\n  A CARD TO THE LADIES.\r\n\r\n  MR GIBSON’S Innocent Composition, so greatly admired for its wonderful\r\n  effects, in removing by the Roots in half a minute, the most strong\r\n  Hair growing in any part of the Head or Face, without the least hurt\r\n  to the finest Skin of Ladies or Children; he sells this useful\r\n  composition at 5s. an ounce, with such full directions that any Person\r\n  may use it themselves.\r\n\r\n  Also his curious Preparation for coaxing Hair to grow on bald Parts\r\n  when worn off by illness, it being allowed by many who have tried many\r\n  approved remedies, to fully answer the desired Purpose.\r\n\r\n  Likewise his Beautifying Paste for the Face, Neck, and Hands, so well\r\n  known to the Ladies for giving a true Enamel to the Skin; in pots at\r\n  10s. 6d. In lesser pots at 5s. each. The above things to be had of him\r\n  and nowhere else in England, next door to the Golden Star in Lower\r\n  Cross Street, Hatton Garden, Holborn.--No less a quantity of the\r\n  composition can be had than one Ounce, nor of the preparation or paste\r\n  than one Pot.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--Gibson in gold Letters over the Door.\r\n\r\nThat the practice of inserting “dummy” advertisements for the purpose of\r\ndrawing others had been adopted before this, is shown by a caution\r\ninserted in the _Public Advertiser_ of January 1, 1765, though why\r\ntheatrical managers should have objected to gratuitous publicity we\r\ncannot understand. Misrepresentation of the title of a play to be\r\nperformed would rarely act detrimentally, while it would often be\r\nbeneficial. Managers of the present day never object to anything but\r\nadverse criticism in a newspaper, and this affects them in various ways.\r\nCritics may be as favourable as they like, but let them condemn a piece\r\nand they raise a storm not easily allayed. The managerial feeling is\r\nthen shown at once. Sometimes the advertisement of the theatre is\r\nsummarily stopped, at others the usual first-night privilege is\r\nsuspended, and not rarely of late years letters have been written and\r\npublished showing how utterly biassed the criticism has been. But not\r\none of the whole theatrical fraternity ever objects to a gratuitous\r\nadvertisement. Even a man who comes on with a message likes it, though\r\nhe in common with all the outsiders of “the profession” affects to\r\ndespise criticism, and will, on the slightest provocation, speak about\r\nwell-known writers for the press in a most contemptuous manner. But here\r\nis the advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  THE Managers of Drury Lane think it proper to give notice that\r\n  Advertisements of their Plays by their authority are published only in\r\n  this Paper and the _Daily Courant_, and that the Publishers of all\r\n  other Papers who presume to insert Advertisements of the same Plays,\r\n  can do it only by some surreptitious intelligence or hearsay which\r\n  frequently leads them to commit gross Errors, as mentioning one Play\r\n  for another, falsely representing the Parts, etc. to the\r\n  misinformation of the Town and the great detriment of the said\r\n  Theatre.\r\n\r\nAs different in style as it is distant in date and place of publication\r\nis the next item which attracts our attention. It looks suspiciously\r\nlike a hoax, for though other Newcastle papers of the time have been\r\nrigorously searched, no news is discovered of Mrs Bell having shared the\r\nfate which is said to overtake all who pry unduly into the secrets of\r\nthe Craft for the purpose of making capital out of their information.\r\nThe advertisement appears in the _Newcastle Courant_ of January 4, 1770,\r\nand runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n  THIS is to acquaint the Public, That on Monday the first instant,\r\n  being the Lodge (or Monthly Meeting) night of the Free and Accepted\r\n  Masons of the 22d Regiment, held at the Crown, near Newgate\r\n  (Newcastle) Mrs Bell, the Landlady of the House, broke open a Door\r\n  (with a Poker) that had not been opened for some Years past, by which\r\n  means she got into an adjacent Room, made two Holes through the Wall,\r\n  and by that stratagem discovered the secrets of Masonry; and she,\r\n  knowing herself to be the first Woman in the World that ever found out\r\n  the Secret, is willing to make it known to all her Sex. So any Lady\r\n  who is desirous of learning the Secrets of Free Masonry, by applying\r\n  to that well-learned Woman (Mrs Bell that lived 15 years in and about\r\n  Newgate) may be instructed in all the Secrets of Masonry.\r\n\r\nComing back to London again, we find the following announcement\r\npublished in more papers than one. It is well worthy of perusal, as\r\ngiving a picture of the loneliness of Chelsea and its approaches a\r\nhundred years ago, when it was a little outlying village, and when the\r\nwhole duty of a watchman was to evade by any and every means in his\r\npower, contact with footpads, “high tobymen,” or burglars:--\r\n\r\n  Chelsea, Middlesex, Feb. 20, 1770.\r\n\r\n  THE Inhabitants of the Parish of Chelsea, being desirous to prevent,\r\n  as far as in them lies, any Robberies or Felonies being committed in\r\n  the said Parish, do hereby give Notice, that they have entered into a\r\n  Subscription, for a Reward for the Discovery of Robberies or Felonies,\r\n  and have therefore paid into the Hands of Mr Edward Anderson, of\r\n  Chelsea aforesaid, as Treasurer, a Sum of Money to answer the several\r\n  Purposes hereafter mentioned, to such Person or Persons who shall,\r\n  during the Space of one whole Year from the Date hereof, apprehend or\r\n  take any Offender or Offenders, as are herein after described, the\r\n  several and respective Rewards hereafter mentioned, in fourteen Days\r\n  after Conviction, over and above what such Person or Persons may be\r\n  entitled unto by such Apprehending and Conviction by any Law now in\r\n  Being.\r\n\r\n  For every Robbery that shall be committed by any Highwayman or\r\n  Highwaymen, Footpad or Footpads, within the said Parish (except that\r\n  Part of the Parish and Road leading from London to Harrow on the Hill,\r\n  which belongs to the said Parish), the Sum of Ten Pounds.\r\n\r\n  For any Person or Persons who shall break into the Dwelling House of\r\n  any Subscriber, or send any Incendiary Letter to any Subscriber, the\r\n  Sum of Ten Pounds.\r\n\r\n  For any Person or Persons who shall steal any Horse, Mare, Colt, or\r\n  other Cattle, belonging to a Subscriber, or commit any Thefts or\r\n  Robberies in any of their Outhouses, the Sum of Five Pounds.\r\n\r\n  For every Theft or Robbery that shall be committed in any Garden,\r\n  Garden-Grounds, or Fields, Orchard, Court Yard, Backside or\r\n  Fish-ponds, or any Barge or Craft lying ashore, belonging to any of\r\n  the Subscribers, or shall steal any of their Fruit, Poultry, Fish,\r\n  Linen, Lead, Iron-Gates, or Gate-Hinges, Pales, or Fences, the Sum of\r\n  Forty Shillings.\r\n\r\n  And the Subscribers do hereby promise to pay and discharge the whole,\r\n  or such Part of the Expence of such Prosecution or Prosecutions of the\r\n  several Offences above-mentioned, as upon Application to any five or\r\n  more of the Subscribers, at a Meeting called for that Purpose, shall\r\n  judge reasonable.\r\n\r\n  And for the farther Encouragement of all and every the Person and\r\n  Persons who shall apprehend and convict any Offender or Offenders in\r\n  any of the Offences aforesaid, the said Subscribers do hereby promise\r\n  to use their Endeavours for procuring the speedy Payment of such\r\n  Reward as such Person or Persons may be entitled to by any Law now in\r\n  Being.\r\n\r\n  And the said Subscribers do farther promise and agree, That if any\r\n  Offenders shall, before his or her own Apprehension for any of the\r\n  Offences aforesaid, voluntarily discover, or apprehend any of his or\r\n  her Accomplices, so as he, she, or they, be convicted thereof, such\r\n  Person so apprehending as aforesaid, shall be entitled to, and have\r\n  such Reward or Sums of Money as before provided for apprehending and\r\n  taking the said several Offenders as aforesaid, upon Conviction.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of the _Daily Courant_ and _Public Advertiser_ with the\r\nmanagers of Drury Lane Theatre seems to have come to a sudden end in\r\n1771, probably for the reasons we have noticed as affecting modern\r\nmanagerial bosoms, for in the _Daily Post_ this appears:--\r\n\r\n  TO prevent any Mistake in future in advertising the Plays and\r\n  entertainments of Drury Lane Theatre, the Managers think it proper to\r\n  declare that the Playbills are inserted by their direction in this\r\n  Paper only.\r\n\r\nThe _St James’s Chronicle_ (a weekly paper which is still alive, and as\r\nstrong in its Toryism as ever), in July 1772, contains an advertisement\r\nwhich for coolness and audacity is very noticeable, even at a time when\r\nrequests were put forth in the columns of the public press with most\r\nunblushing effrontery:--\r\n\r\n  WANTED immediately, Fifteen Hundred or Two Thousand Pounds by a person\r\n  not worth a Groat, who having neither Houses, Lands, Annuities or\r\n  public Funds, can offer no other Security than that of simple Bond,\r\n  bearing simple interest and engaging the Repayment of the Sum borrowed\r\n  in five, six or seven Years, as may be agreed upon by the Parties.\r\n  Whoever this may suit (for it is hoped it will suit somebody) by\r\n  directing a line to A. Z. in Rochester, shall be immediately replied\r\n  to or waited on, as may appear necessary.\r\n\r\nBenevolence must have been very strongly developed in any one who\r\nacceded to the requests of A. Z. But that there was a deal of that\r\ncommodity afloat at the time of which we are writing, our next specimen,\r\none of disinterestedness and charity, shows. It is from the _Gazetteer_\r\nof November 29, 1773:--\r\n\r\n  A LADY of strict Honour and Benevolence, who lives in a genteel sphere\r\n  of Life, influenced by a variety of critical Circumstances, offers her\r\n  Service as an Advocate to Persons under the most intricate\r\n  Circumstances, especially to those of her own Sex, whose Troubles she\r\n  can with a secret Sympathy share, and who will point out certain Means\r\n  of alleviating their Distress. The Advertiser has a Genteel House to\r\n  accommodate such Persons, while their Affairs are settled. The\r\n  greatest Delicacy, Discretion, and most Inviolable Secrecy may be\r\n  depended on. Therefore to prevent being made the sport of Curiosity,\r\n  the Advertiser is determined to answer such Letters only that appear\r\n  explicit and satisfactory, with the Principal’s Name and Place of\r\n  Abode. Please to address a line (post paid) for Mrs Gladen, at No. 5\r\n  Church Row, Aldgate Church, Whitechapel.\r\n\r\nEspecially those of her own sex. It would be hard to discover what any\r\none of an opposite gender could want as resident with this nice old\r\nlady, unless indeed he wished to put in practice the advice given to\r\nNicodemus. But, as for money this benevolent beldame would have done\r\nanything, there is little doubt she had plenty of visitors of both\r\nsexes. It does not do, however, to be too hard on Mrs Gladen, when it is\r\nconsidered that she has many highly successful and extremely respectable\r\nrepresentatives of the present day. We therefore pass on to the latter\r\npart of 1774, when it is evident, from a perusal of the advertisements\r\nalone, that a general election is impending. In September we find this\r\nin the _Morning Post_:--\r\n\r\n  A GENTLEMAN of Character and considerable Fortune is extremely\r\n  desirous of a HIGH HONOUR at an approaching Period. Any one who can\r\n  assist him, or point out an eligible means of succeeding, shall be\r\n  amply recompensed both at present and in future.--In short, name your\r\n  Terms; secrecy is all required on his part. A Line to Mr Dormer, at\r\n  No. 24 Ludgate Hill, will be attended to.\r\n\r\nThe _Morning Post_ seems to have been a particular medium for the\r\nprocess by which legislators were made in the “good old days”--good\r\nenough for the rich and unscrupulous, of course--for very shortly\r\nafterwards many of the same kind appear. The following stipulates the\r\namount, and with true unselfishness recommends the candidate:--\r\n\r\n  A GENTLEMAN of Honour, Character, and Fortune, who has £1,500 at his\r\n  Bankers’, has some desire to obtain a Seat. A connection with him will\r\n  do no discredit to any Man of Rank, or Body of Men. As he is serious,\r\n  he expects no Application but from such as are so, to Q. at New\r\n  Lloyd’s Coffee-house, Cornhill.\r\n\r\nOne who follows is much more generous, so far as money is concerned,\r\nthough he lacks the disinterested recommendation of Q. Still as money\r\nand not mind is the desideratum among election agents, there is little\r\nfear that the chances were in favour of W. W., though doubtless there\r\nwas room enough found at St Stephen’s for both. Room for two! room for\r\ntwo hundred who had money with which to pave their way:--\r\n\r\n  A GENTLEMAN of independent fortune is ready to give three Thousand\r\n  Guineas to be accommodated with a certain purpose to answer the\r\n  advertiser’s end at this Crisis. Any one inclined to treat about the\r\n  above, may be further informed by Line, or otherwise, directed for W.\r\n  W., at George’s Coffee-house, upper end of the Haymarket.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the advertisements in reference to the\r\nelections emanated only from persons desirous of writing themselves down\r\nM.P.’s. There were plenty anxious as well as willing to assist them for\r\na consideration. From many of that time we select one, still taking the\r\n_Morning Post_ as our guide:--\r\n\r\n  ANY Man of Fortune or Family wishing to enjoy an Honourable Station\r\n  for seven Years, and to accomplish it without the anxiety which\r\n  generally accompanies the attaining it by Contention, may probably be\r\n  accommodated to the utmost of his Wishes, by addressing himself to C.\r\n  C. to be left at the bar of the Chapter Coffee-house, Paternoster Row,\r\n  and disclosing his Name, the which he may do without the risk of being\r\n  divulged, as the advertiser pledges himself that the most inviolable\r\n  Delicacy and Secrecy will be observed.\r\n\r\nWe commend the foregoing to the notice of the gentlemen who talk of\r\nConservatism as the bulwark of the nation, and rejoice over any\r\nso-called political reaction. However, as Conservatism now means\r\n“dishing the Whigs” by the most advanced measures, we can put up with\r\nit, and so pass on to another specimen from the _Morning Post_, which is\r\npublished at the same time as the foregoing, and is found snugly\r\nensconced among those of quite a different tendency:--\r\n\r\n  A YOUNG Gentleman of the most liberal education and a genteel Address,\r\n  would be happy in having an opportunity of devoting his services to a\r\n  Lady of real fashion and fortune, who may wish to have some particular\r\n  deficiencies thoroughly supplied, without subjecting herself to any\r\n  disagreeable restraint. Any lady to whom such an offer may be\r\n  suitable, will receive the fullest Explanation, in answer to a letter\r\n  addressed to A. X. Turk’s head Coffee House, Strand.\r\n\r\nWe will leave this without further comment than the expression of a sad\r\nidea that this young gentleman knew what was marketable, as well as a\r\nbelief that he and others like him may have done much to prevent the\r\ntitles and fortunes of noblemen and gentlemen who married late in life\r\nfrom passing to remote branches. We have no wish to intrude our\r\nopinions, which are strong as our faith in human nature is weak, but the\r\nadvertisement is only a specimen of many others, and, like its\r\ncongeners, appears in one of the highest class daily papers of the time.\r\nFolk are not so outspoken now as was the fashion a hundred years ago,\r\nyet is there any one who will venture to state that we are more\r\nvirtuous? It will be the natural impulse of many who read the next\r\nadvertisement, which is also from the now fashionable and severely\r\nvirtuous _Post_ (date January 21, 1775), to cry out against the\r\nunnatural guardian who offers to sell his ward. Perhaps though, if they\r\ntake time to reflect, they may remember instances of marriage for money,\r\nwhich, if not so public, were quite as iniquitous. Listen to a gentleman\r\nof honour of the last century:--\r\n\r\n  A GENTLEMAN of Honour and Property, having in his disposal at present\r\n  a young Lady of good Family, with a fortune of Sixty Thousand Pounds,\r\n  on her Marriage with his approbation, would be very happy to treat\r\n  with a Man of Fashion and Family, who may think it worth his while to\r\n  give the Advertiser a Gratuity of Five thousand pounds on the day of\r\n  Marriage. As this is no common advertisement, it is expected no\r\n  Gentleman will apply whose Family and Connections will not bear the\r\n  strictest enquiry. The Advertiser having always lived retired from the\r\n  World, immersed in business, is unacquainted with those of that Rank\r\n  of Life that the Lady’s fortune entitles her to be connected with,\r\n  for which reason he has made this public application. Letters\r\n  addressed to L. M., at Tom’s Coffee House, Devereux Court, near the\r\n  Temple, mentioning real Name, and places of Abode, will punctually be\r\n  attended to.\r\n\r\nThis is not so bad for a poor innocent who has lived retired from the\r\nworld. And doubtless, though he was unacquainted with those of that rank\r\nof life to which a lady with sixty thousand pounds might well aspire, he\r\nwas not to be deceived by even the most specious of fortune-hunters,\r\nIrishmen included. But here is another notice quite as interesting,\r\nthough of a very different kind. It is also from the _Morning Post_, and\r\nappears a few days after that we have chosen to precede it:--\r\n\r\n  To the LADIES on MONEY AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS there are Sundry Ladies Who Have Two, Three, Or Four thousand\r\n  pounds, or even more Money at their command, and who, from not knowing\r\n  how to dispose of the same to the greatest advantage, but by living on\r\n  the Small Interests which the stocks produce, afford them but a scanty\r\n  Maintenance, especially to those who have been accustomed to\r\n  Affluence, and would wish to live so still; the Advertiser (who is a\r\n  Gentleman of independent Fortune, strict Honour and Character, and\r\n  above any other reward than the pleasure of serving the Sex) acquaints\r\n  such Ladies, that if they will favour him with their Name and Address,\r\n  so as he may wait on them as opportunity best suits, he will put them\r\n  into a Method by which they may, without any Trouble, and with an\r\n  absolute Certainty, place out their Money, so as for it to produce\r\n  them a clear and lawful interest of Ten or Twelve per cent, and that\r\n  too on equally as good and safe Securities as if in the Funds, or on\r\n  Mortgage at the common low interest, etc.\r\n\r\n  Please to direct to R. J. Esq. at the Turks Head Coffee house,\r\n  opposite Catharine Street, in the Strand, and the same will be duly\r\n  attended to.\r\n\r\nThere was no Associate Institute then to look after the interests of\r\nunprotected females; and perhaps if there had been, so plausible a rogue\r\nwould not have attracted the attention of its highly paid officials. But\r\nthe “weaker vessels” seem able to take their own parts at advertising,\r\nfor the following is by no means a unique specimen of their effusions.\r\nOnce again we draw from the _Morning Post_, the date being December 15,\r\n1775:--\r\n\r\n  A LADY wishes to borrow One Hundred Pounds. The Security, though\r\n  personal, may probably be very agreeable to a single Gentleman of\r\n  spirit. Every particular will be communicated with Candour and\r\n  Sincerity, where confidence is so far reposed as to give the real Name\r\n  and Address of the party willing to oblige the Advertiser. Gentlemen\r\n  of real Fortune and liberal Sentiments, and those only, are requested\r\n  to address a line to Y. N. at Mr Dyke’s, Cross Street, Long-Acre.\r\n\r\nThis lady was modest as well as candid and sincere; it is to be hoped\r\nshe was pretty also, or else she had small chance. But now comes not\r\nvirtue but honours in distress, and sufficiently hungry to be satisfied\r\nwith very dirty pudding. In our own times baronets have seen\r\nunpleasantnesses; we remember one who used to do casual reporting,\r\nfires, accidents, coroners’ inquests, &c., and another who took to the\r\nstage, unsuccessfully. But he who advertised in the _Daily Advertiser_\r\nof January 23, 1776, was worse off than any titled successor. Judge for\r\nyourselves:--\r\n\r\n  MATRIMONY.\r\n\r\n  For Fifty Pounds only, may gain One Hundred and Forty Thousand.\r\n\r\n  A BARONET of Great Britain, that has an eligible chance and right in\r\n  thirteen distinct Claims to speedily recover the above Sum, or to\r\n  expect part by a Compromise, inforced by a very little Assistance,\r\n  will marry any Woman, though with Child, or having Children by a\r\n  former Husband, that will put such a Fifty-pound ticket in such\r\n  Lottery; the remainder of her Money, if any, will be settled upon her;\r\n  his person may not be objected to, and her Attorney may liberally\r\n  inspect Writings, &c. which in form set forth his expectancies\r\n  perspicuously; and any young Counsel or others may gain an Advantage,\r\n  even a Fortune, by offering a small benevolent Assistance. Direct for\r\n  the Baronet, at No. 2, near Blenheim Steps, in Oxford St., opposite\r\n  Oxford Market, who has also a profession that may be made very\r\n  advantageous for any new Adventurer in the physical way, that has a\r\n  little money to join with him as a Partner. A patient hearing will\r\n  obviate all Objection, and the strictest Secrecy and Honour may be\r\n  depended on.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that “the Baronet,” like those of his rank already\r\nreferred to, was not above turning his hand to earn an honest penny. A\r\nlittle way back we invited the attention of Conservatives to an edifying\r\nextract; may we now dedicate the baronet’s appeal to those who would\r\nabolish the laws of primogeniture? Let them be advised in time, unless\r\nthey should wish to see a duke reduced to despondency, or an earl\r\nholding horses for his living. No matter what happens to younger sons.\r\nLet them and their younger sons be swallowed up in the middle and lower\r\nclasses, as they are now, though nobody seems to notice it; but let us\r\npreserve, no matter who else suffers, our titled aristocracy in its\r\npresent exalted position. But what is to become of the scions of\r\nnobility who have no claim upon landed estate, when nepotism ceases to\r\nexist, sinecures are abolished, and all Government clerkships are matter\r\nof open competition! Frankly we do not know, but doubtless Providence\r\nwill always be tenderly disposed towards persons of good family. Turning\r\nonce more to the _Morning Post_ (February 15, 1776), we come upon an\r\nannouncement the merits of which are hard to determine. It promises\r\nrather too much:--\r\n\r\n  FEMALE COMPANION.\r\n\r\n  A LADY of independent Fortune and liberal Sentiments would be glad if,\r\n  in procuring to herself an agreeable Companion she could at the same\r\n  time relieve from Distress, and perhaps prevent from utter Ruin, some\r\n  still deserving although unfortunate fair one; for she can make\r\n  allowance for the frailty of her own Sex, and knows the base arts of\r\n  the other; in a word, a _single_ _faux pas_ will be no objection,\r\n  provided there remain a virtuous Disposition, and that the person\r\n  wanted be good-natured, affable, and sincere in the account she may\r\n  give of herself, which for that purpose may at first be anonymous. She\r\n  must also possess the usual accomplishments required by a good\r\n  Education; know something of Music, have an agreeable Voice, and a\r\n  genteel Person, not under twenty nor above the age of twenty-five\r\n  years. Such as come within this description may apply by letter to B.\r\n  D. at the York Coffee House, St James’s Street, and the apparently\r\n  most deserving will be enquired after. No kept Mistress or lady of\r\n  Pleasure need apply.\r\n\r\nThere seems more of the procuress than the patron about this; still\r\nthere is no knowing what the taste of an elderly single lady who fancied\r\nherself injured by the opposite sex would not lead her to do. So leaving\r\nthe question open, and trusting the reader will be able to satisfy\r\nhimself as to the purity or the reverse of the advertiser’s motives, we\r\nwill pass on to _Lloyd’s Evening Post_, in which, about the same time,\r\nwe find the following, which is worthy of notice:--\r\n\r\n  MONEY wanted--when it can be procured--£100. No security can be given\r\n  for the _Principal_, and possibly the _Interest_ may not be punctually\r\n  paid. Under the above circumstances should any one be found willing to\r\n  lend the desired Sum, he will much _surprise_, and particularly\r\n  _oblige_ the author of this advertisement.--Direct for A. B. C.\r\n  George’s Coffeehouse, Haymarket.\r\n\r\nEven the “author” of this, confident and assured as he must be\r\ngenerally, seems to doubt the readiness of people to part with their\r\nmoney without some inducement, no matter how slight. If A. B. C. had\r\noffered something impossible of fulfilment in return for the desired\r\nloan, he would very likely have had many applications, whereas it would\r\nbe hard to believe that in the present instance he had even one. Now, if\r\nhe had adopted a plan similar to that which is advertised in the\r\n_Morning Chronicle_ of April 9, 1776, he would have had a much better\r\nchance of raising the wind. This must have arrested the attention and\r\ndiverted the current of pocket-money of many young lovers:--\r\n\r\n  AFFECTION.\r\n\r\n  ANY Lady or Gentleman who has made an honourable Connection, may be\r\n  acquainted if the other party has a reciprocal Affection; and so nice\r\n  is the method, that it gives in a great measure the degree of esteem.\r\n  No fortune-telling, nor anything trifling in it, but is a serious and\r\n  sincere Procedure. To divest any apprehension of discovery of parties,\r\n  the initials of their names is sufficient. That the meaning of the\r\n  advertiser may be ascertained, it is only asked for A. B. to know if\r\n  C. D. has a genuine affection; and of C. D. if A. B. has the like. It\r\n  is requested that honest Initials be sent, else the deposit of two\r\n  shillings and sixpence is useless. But to convince those that send for\r\n  the intelligence of the use of this, they need only to send with the\r\n  real, other Initials indifferent to them, and they will be satisfied.\r\n  Absence or distance does not abate the certainty of the then present\r\n  Esteem and Affection.\r\n\r\n  Letters (free) directed to S. J., No. 11, Duke-street, Grosvenor\r\n  Square, will have honest answers left there, or sent conformable to\r\n  the address, in a day or two after their Receipt.\r\n\r\nThe next advertisement we find in our collection savours less of\r\naffection, for the desire of the inserter seems to be to prevent some\r\none to whom he has an objection inheriting entailed estates. It has its\r\nvalue, in addition to what consideration may be given to it as a\r\nspecimen of the manners of the last century, as showing the kind of\r\npeople who then made the laws. Decency must have made a decided advance,\r\nlook at it from what point we will, since April 16, 1776, when this\r\nappeared in the _Public Advertiser_:--\r\n\r\n  A GENTLEMAN who hath filled two succeeding seats in Parliament, is\r\n  near sixty years of age, lives in great splendour and hospitality, and\r\n  from whom a considerable Estate must pass if he dies without issue,\r\n  hath no objection to marry any Widow or single Lady, provided the\r\n  party be of genteel birth, polite manners, and five, six, seven, or\r\n  eight Months gone in her Pregnancy.\r\n\r\n  Letters directed to ---- Brecknock, Esq., at Will’s Coffee House,\r\n  facing the Admiralty, will be honoured with due attention, secrecy,\r\n  and every possible mark of respect.\r\n\r\nIn the _Daily Advertiser_ of July, in the same year, we find the\r\nfollowing, which, though of a much more legitimate character than that\r\njust quoted, and directed to the interests of fair and honest trading,\r\nwill repay perusal:--\r\n\r\n  TWO Men beg leave to acquaint the Public in general that they keep the\r\n  cleanest Barber’s Shop in all London, where the people can have their\r\n  Hair cut for 2d., dressed for 3d., and be shaved for 1d. One of these\r\n  Men can bleed and draw teeth very well; he bleeds both in the English\r\n  and German manner, as well at home as abroad, and is exceeding\r\n  careful. Bleeding 3d., drawing teeth 4d. There is a parlour made in\r\n  the shop on purpose for bleeding and drawing teeth. The people may\r\n  depend on being served immediately and well in every respect. No\r\n  satisfaction, no pay. The above-mentioned Shop is at No. 7 King\r\n  Street, Seven Dials.\r\n\r\nBleeding nowadays is still done by barbers, though not in the same way,\r\nnor so scientifically, as practised by the two clean shopkeepers of King\r\nStreet. Shaving as a high art is neglected nowadays, a state of affairs\r\ntraceable to the beard and moustache movement of the last twenty years,\r\nwhich has rendered shaving below the attention of true artists, who now\r\ngive their attention to “cutting and curling,” &c. Any one who doubts\r\nthis had better trust himself to the untender mercies of half-a-dozen\r\ndifferent barbers, in ordinary thoroughfares, and where the prices are\r\nfixed at ordinary rates. Before he has tried the sixth establishment he\r\nwill not only have conformed to our views, but will be a considerably\r\naltered, if not an improved, man. In the _Morning Post_ of October 13,\r\n1778, we come across an appeal to the short-sighted, which is worthy of\r\nthe tribes of welchers who in our own times have made large fortunes\r\nthrough advertising in the columns of the sporting papers. This must\r\nhave been something like the “discretionary investment” dodge, which\r\nbrought in large sums to swindling firms who professed to govern the\r\nturf a few years back, and whose advertisements occupied whole columns\r\nin the newspapers:--\r\n\r\n  A SERIOUS though SURPRISING OFFER.\r\n\r\n  FOR the compliment of One Hundred Guineas, any enterprizing Gentleman\r\n  or Lady may have revealed to them an eligible method of converting\r\n  hundreds into Thousands, in a few weeks, and of continuing so to do\r\n  yearly. The requiring so inadequate a consideration, is because the\r\n  proposer is under misfortunes. Only letters with real names and\r\n  residencies will be regarded. Direct for W. W., at the King’s Bench\r\n  Coffee-House.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1778 (May 7) the _Morning Post_ contained the\r\nfollowing appeal for an article which has been scarce ever since the\r\nworld began, which is not valued much when possessed, and which is about\r\nthe last thing one could hope to obtain through the medium of an\r\nadvertisement, no matter how cunningly contrived, nor how great the\r\ncirculation of the paper in which it appeared:--\r\n\r\n  WANTED immediately, the most difficult thing to be met with in the\r\n  world, A SINCERE FRIEND, by a person, who, though in the meridian of\r\n  life, has outlived all he had. He wishes to meet with a Person in whom\r\n  he may repose the most implicit Confidence; a Person who has a good\r\n  heart, and abilities to second that goodness of heart; who will give\r\n  his advice cordially, and assistance readily. The advertiser is a\r\n  person in a genteel situation of life; has a decent income, but is at\r\n  present so circumstanced as to want a sincere friend.--Any Person\r\n  willing (from principles of Friendship, not Curiosity) to reply to the\r\n  above, by directing a line to T. S., at Mr Sharp’s, stationer, facing\r\n  Somerset House, Strand, will be immediately waited on or properly\r\n  replied to.\r\n\r\nMoney, the sincerest of all friends, is probably the object of T. S.’s\r\nambition. If he was not suited in the year ’78, an opportunity occurred\r\nsoon after; for specially directed to the cupidity of persons who desire\r\nto get money, and are not at all particular what the means so long as\r\nthe end is attained, is the following, which appears in the _Morning\r\nPost_ of March 1779:--\r\n\r\n  A GENTLEMAN of Fortune, whom Family reasons oblige to drop a\r\n  connection which has for some time subsisted between him and an\r\n  agreeable young Lady, will give a considerable sum of Money with her\r\n  to any Gentleman, or person in genteel Business, who has good sense\r\n  and resolution to despise the censures of the World, and will enter\r\n  with her into the Holy state of Matrimony. Letters addressed to Mr G.\r\n  H., at the Cecil Street Coffee-House, will be paid due attention to.\r\n\r\nAs this kind of arrangement has not yet fallen into desuetude, although\r\nthe aid of advertisements is no longer invoked for it, we had better not\r\ngive an opinion about its morality, though it is but fair to admit that\r\nif the system of selling soiled goods, of which the foregoing is an\r\nexample, had but been out of date, we should have been loud in our\r\nobjections. For no vice is so bad as one that has exploded, and the\r\nweaknesses which we can regard with complacency while they are current,\r\ncause strong emotions of disgust when, their day being over, we look\r\nback upon them, and wonder how people could have been so extremely\r\nwicked. About the same time, and in the same paper, is another\r\napplication of a peculiar nature, though in this instance the advertiser\r\nwishes not to part with, but to obtain a similar commodity to that\r\nadvertised by G. H. This is it:--\r\n\r\n  A SINGLE Gentleman of Fortune, who lives in a genteel private style,\r\n  is desirous of meeting with an agreeable genteel young Lady, of from\r\n  20 to 30 years of age, not older, to superintend and take upon her the\r\n  management of his House and Servants, for which she will be\r\n  complimented with board, &c. As the situation will be quite genteel,\r\n  it will not suit any but such who has had a liberal Education, and who\r\n  has some independance of her own, so as to enable her always to appear\r\n  very genteel, and as a relation or particular friend, in which\r\n  character she will always be esteemed, and have every respect paid\r\n  her, so as to render the situation and every thing else as agreeable\r\n  as possible.\r\n\r\n  Any lady inclining to the above, will please to direct with name and\r\n  address, to M. H., Esq., to be left at No. 7, the Bookseller’s, in\r\n  Great Newport Street, near St Martin’s Lane; she will be waited on, or\r\n  wrote to, but with the greatest delicacy, and every degree of strict\r\n  honour and secrecy.\r\n\r\nStrict honour and secrecy seems to be an essential to the successful\r\ncompletion of the designs of many advertisers of this time, but they are\r\nto be all on one side, in company with an amount of blind credulity\r\nwhich would be wonderful if it were not repeatedly exhibited in modern\r\ndays. Here is an honourable and secret venture which appears in the\r\n_Morning Post_ of December 17, 1779, and which was doubtless very\r\nsuccessful:--\r\n\r\n  A GENTLEMAN who knows a Method which reduces it almost to a certainty\r\n  to obtain a very considerable sum, by insuring of Numbers in the\r\n  Lottery, is advised by his Friends to offer to communicate it to\r\n  those who wish to speculate in that Way. The advantage that is\r\n  procured by proceeding according to his Principles and Directions,\r\n  will be plainly demonstrated and made perfectly evident to any who\r\n  chuses to be informed of it. The terms are Ten Guineas each person,\r\n  and they must engage not to discover the plan for the space of\r\n  eighteen months. If those who are willing to agree to the above terms\r\n  will be pleased to address a line to J. R. C. at the Union\r\n  Coffee-House, Cornhill, or the York Coffee House, St James’s Street,\r\n  they will be immediately informed where to apply. Those who have lost\r\n  money already (by laying it out improperly) insuring of Numbers, may\r\n  soon be convinced how much it will be to their advantage to apply as\r\n  above.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--This advertisement will be inserted in this morning’s Paper\r\n  only.\r\n\r\nA suspicious person would have fancied that the friends of J. R. C.,\r\nunless they were dissimilar from other friends, would have used the\r\ninformation for their own benefit--but generous and self-abnegating\r\npeople do turn up in history in the most unexpected and unaccountable\r\nways. Another specimen of the secret and honourable kind, though in it\r\nthe secrecy and honour have to be on the side of the advertiser,\r\nfollows. It is in the _Morning Post_, April 18, 1780, and runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  ANY Lady whose Situation may require a Temporary Retirement, may be\r\n  accommodated agreeable to her wishes in the house of a Gentleman of\r\n  eminence in the Profession, where honour and secrecy may be depended\r\n  on, and where every vestige of Pregnancy is obliterated; or any Lady\r\n  who wishes to become Pregnant may have the causes of sterility removed\r\n  in the safest manner. Letters (Post-paid) addressed to A. B. No. 23,\r\n  Fleet Street, will be attended to.\r\n\r\nA. B. offers a double convenience, the second item in which is well\r\nworthy of note. The house must have been somewhat similar, except that\r\nthe accommodation was for human beings, to those establishments\r\nadvertisements in connection with which frequently appear in the\r\nsporting and agricultural papers. Much about the same date as the\r\nspecimen just quoted appears another of quite a different kind, inserted\r\nin several journals. It is rather unique as a way of reminding\r\ncustomers that life is short and debt is long, and is suspiciously\r\nsartorial:--\r\n\r\n  TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.\r\n\r\n  RICHARD Guy returns thanks to all his good old Friends for their kind\r\n  Recommendation, which he will always acknowledge with gratitude, by\r\n  being ready to oblige them on all occasions, but earnestly desires to\r\n  settle Accounts, to pay and to be paid; which he hopes will be of\r\n  satisfaction to both parties; for as it is fully observed, short\r\n  Reckonings keep long Friends; so to preserve good friendship and\r\n  prevent disputes in Accompts, he always pays ready Money, that is\r\n  doing as he would be done unto.\r\n\r\n  N.B.--He courts neither Honour nor Riches, his whole and sole motive\r\n  being to serve his good old Friends; the sin of Ingratitude he utterly\r\n  abhors.\r\n\r\nThe shameless manner in which sinecures in Government offices were\r\nbought and sold even so late as 1781 is shown by the following specimen\r\nadvertisement, which is taken from the _Morning Herald_ of September\r\n22:--\r\n\r\n  A GENTLEMAN of Character who wishes for some Employ under Government\r\n  merely for the sake of Amusement, would be willing to advance any\r\n  Nobleman or Gentleman the sum of Three Thousand Pounds, upon Mortgage,\r\n  upon legal Interest, provided the Mortgager will, thro’ his Interest,\r\n  procure a place in any genteel Department, where the emoluments are\r\n  not less than two or three hundred Pounds _per annum_. The Advertiser\r\n  flatters himself this will not be deemed an ineligible Offer, if\r\n  compared with the present mode of raising Money upon Annuities; as a\r\n  gentleman must be obliged to grant five hundred _per annum_ out of his\r\n  income to raise the like Sum. If any Gentleman who may be inclined to\r\n  answer this Advertisement does not know of any Vacancy, the Advertiser\r\n  will point out several, which may be easily procured by interest. A\r\n  line addressed to S. X. to be left at the bar of the Chapter\r\n  Coffee-house, St Paul’s, will be attended to. Secrecy may be depended\r\n  on. No Broker will be treated with.\r\n\r\nThose were happy times, indeed, when no such vulgar thing as merit was\r\nallowed to interfere with a man’s upward progress in life, provided he\r\npossessed capital, which could always secure him good interest in more\r\nways than one. Money was at full value then, and the following, from\r\nthe _Morning Post_ of October 18, 1781, is one among many endeavours to\r\nobtain it in larger or smaller quantities:--\r\n\r\n  WANTED immediately, or as soon as can be met with, that invaluable\r\n  acquisition (when once gained) A SINCERE Friend, by a person who in\r\n  the early part of his life had many; but who, from the all-powerful\r\n  hand of Death and other fortuitous incidents, has been deprived of all\r\n  those whom he could once call by that sacred Name, and to whom he\r\n  could apply either for Counsel or Assistance. The author of this\r\n  Advertisement is a Middle-aged man, in a genteel situation of Life, a\r\n  Housekeeper, has a decent Income, but yet, is so circumstanced as to\r\n  have a particular occasion for FIFTY OR SIXTY Pounds, for a Year and a\r\n  half or thereabouts. He wishes therefore to meet with a Person of\r\n  liberal and generous Sentiments, who would assist him with the above\r\n  trifling Sum. He flatters himself he can make the mode of payment\r\n  quite agreeable to any Gentleman, Lady, or Tradesman of credit, who\r\n  may be induced to answer this advertisement from a motive arising from\r\n  the secret satisfaction there is in rendering a Service.--A line\r\n  directed for S. E., and left at the Morning Post Office, will be\r\n  immediately attended to.\r\n\r\nIn 1785 was established the _Daily Universal Register_, a paper which\r\nwas, under a new title, adopted in 1788, to develop into the greatest\r\nand most powerful organ in the world. On the 1st of January, in the\r\nlast-named year, the _Register_ appeared with the following heading:\r\n_The Times, or Daily Universal Register, printed Logographically_. The\r\nprice was threepence, and for many years the _Times_ gave no promise of\r\nfuture greatness; but it was always fearless, and very early was fined,\r\nwhile its editor narrowly escaped imprisonment. In 1790 Mr Walter was\r\nactually incarcerated in Newgate, where he remained sixteen months,\r\nbesides being fined £200, for a libel on the Dukes of York and Clarence.\r\nHe was released eventually at the intercession of the Prince of Wales.\r\nThe history of the _Times_ has been told so often that particulars are\r\nhardly needed here; but as showing how its present eminence is due to\r\nnothing but perseverance and integrity, as well as the everpresent\r\ndesire to be first wherever possible, we quote the following from a\r\nshort notice of the life of one of its proprietors: “It was under John\r\nWalter II., born in 1784, that the _Times_ rose to the place of the\r\nfirst newspaper in the world. Whilst yet a youth, in 1803 he became\r\njoint proprietor and sole manager of the _Times_, and very soon his hand\r\nbecame manifest in the vigour and independence of its politics, and the\r\nfreshness of its news. Free speech, however, had its penalties. The\r\n_Times_ denounced the malpractices of Lord Melville, and the Government\r\nrevenged itself by withdrawing from the Walters the office of printers\r\nto the Customs, which had been held by the family for eighteen years.\r\nDuring the war between Napoleon and Austria in 1805, the desire for news\r\nwas intense. To thwart the _Times_ the packets for Walter were stopped\r\nat the outports, while those for the ministerial journals were hurried\r\nto London. Complaint was made, and the reply was given that the editor\r\nmight receive his foreign papers as a _favour_; meaning thereby that if\r\nthe Government was gracious to the _Times_, the _Times_ should be\r\ngracious to the Government; but Walter would accept no favour on such\r\nterms. Thrown on his own resources, he contrived, by means of superior\r\nactivity and stratagem, to surpass the ministry in early intelligence of\r\nevents. The capitulation of Flushing in August 1809, was announced by\r\nthe _Times_ two days before the news had arrived through any other\r\nchannel. In the editorship of the paper he spared neither pains nor\r\nexpense. The best writers were employed, and wherever a correspondent or\r\na reporter displayed marked ability, he was carefully looked after and\r\nhis faculty utilised. Correspondents were posted in every great city in\r\nthe world, and well-qualified reporters were despatched to every scene\r\nof public interest. The debates in Parliament, law proceedings, public\r\nmeetings, and commercial affairs, were all reported with a fulness and\r\naccuracy which filled readers with wonder. What a visionary could\r\nscarcely dare to ask, the _Times_ gave. To other journals imitation\r\nalone was left. They might be more consistent politicians, but in the\r\nstaple of a newspaper, to be nearly as good as the _Times_ was their\r\nhighest praise.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE TIMES\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: OR·DAILY·UNIVERSAL·REGISTER\r\n\r\n  PRINTED LOGOGRAPHICALLY]\r\n\r\n  NUMB. 940.\r\n\r\n  TUESDAY, JANUARY 1, 1788.\r\n\r\n  (Price Three-pence.)\r\n\r\n  ^Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.^\r\n\r\n  By his MAJESTY’S COMPANY,\r\n  THIS EVENING,\r\n  Will be presented the Tragedy of\r\n\r\n  _JULIA,_\r\n  OR, THE ITALIAN LOVER.\r\n\r\n  The principal Characters by\r\n  Mr. KEMBLE and Mrs. SIDDONS.\r\n\r\n  The Prologue to be spoken by Mr. Kemble;\r\n  And the Epilogue by Mrs. Siddons.\r\n  With New Dresses, Decorations, &c.\r\n\r\n  To which will be added\r\n  The DESERTER\r\n  Henry, Mr. KELLY, Skirmish, Mr. BANNISTER, jun.\r\n  And Louisa, by Mrs. CROUCH.\r\n\r\n  To-morrow (by Desire) The Wonder, with, the 6th time, Harlequin, Jun.\r\n  On Thursday, the tragedy of Percy; Elwina, Mrs. Siddons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _BY COMMAND OF HIS MAJESTY,_\r\n\r\n  And under the same DIRECTORS as the CONCERT\r\n  of ANTIENT MUSIC.\r\n\r\n  THE Oratorios of SOLOMON, ALEXANDER’S FEAST, with the CHOICE OF\r\n  HERCULES; JOSEPH; ACIS and GALATEA, with DRYDEN’S ODE; ESTHER; and\r\n  MESSIAH, will be performed on the six FRIDAYS in LENT, at the CONCERT\r\n  ROOM in TOTTENHAM STREET.\r\n\r\n  Subscriptions taken at Messrs.

DEEDS, not _words_, prove _sincerity_, and by\r\n  future endeavours to entertain and inform, THE TIMES will evince their\r\n  _zeal_ in the service of THE PUBLIC, and their _feelings_ for the\r\n  favours bestowed upon the UNIVERSAL REGISTER.\r\n\r\n  MR. WALTER, _patentee_ of the _Logographic Press_, cannot omit\r\n  his tribute of thanks for the very great encouragement\r\n  which his endeavours to improve the art of printing have\r\n  experienced--notwithstanding the unjust and illiberal measures adopted\r\n  to impede its progress and injure him. An accurate statement of these\r\n  mean and invidious practices he is determined to lay before the public\r\n  in a pamphlet on a future day; at present he will only mention a very\r\n  recent one. THE DAILY ADVERTISER being generally read by the lower\r\n  orders of the people, he offered at its office an Advertisement for\r\n  several apprentices, which MR. JENOUR, the Printer, refused to insert,\r\n  though he had received payment several days preceding.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  LONDON.\r\n\r\n  Last night her Majesty had a concert of vocal and instrumental music\r\n  at the Palace at Windsor.\r\n\r\n  The 7th of this month is fixed for the celebration of the marriage of\r\n  the Archduke of Austria and the Princess Elizabeth of Wirtemberg.--The\r\n  ceremony will be performed at Vienna.\r\n\r\n  The great heiress, Miss Pulteney, the daughter of William Pulteney,\r\n  Esq., came of age last Thursday.--The entertainments on the occasion\r\n  were very splendid, and the celebration kept at Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n  The indisposition of Lord Salisbury is a public evil; and to do his\r\n  Herefordshire neighbours justice they think so, independent of their\r\n  Christmas disappointment. Other and honourable feelings operate more\r\n  upon the occasion.\r\n\r\n  Great expectations are formed of Mr. _Fitzherbert’s_ talents in the\r\n  important post to which he has lately been appointed; and we are ready\r\n  to believe that he will amply fulfil them. But of this we are rather\r\n  certain, that however he may surmount the attacks of the _Hibernian_\r\n  politicians, if the jolly fellows once get him amongst them, they will\r\n  soon make him feel a _want of understanding_.\r\n\r\n  The MINISTER, among his late acquisitions, his obtained a gift of an\r\n  _under_ WAISTCOTE, which, however, he has ordered to be _hung up_ in\r\n  his wardrobe, not wishing to wear near his _heart_ a vestment that has\r\n  come from the enemy, and which, like the _shirt_ presented by\r\n  _Dejianira_ to _Hercules_, is probably _poisoned_, and would rather\r\n  raise a _blister_ than prove of salutary effect.\r\n\r\n  The _information_ offered by the DESERTER from the _political_\r\n  BANDITTI meets with no credit in _Court_; it having been repeatedly\r\n  determined at the Sessions house in _the Old Bailey_ that an\r\n  _approver_, vulgarly called a _King’s Evidence_, shall have no\r\n  _credit_ with _good men_ and _true_, unless his testimony be supported\r\n  by witnesses of _honest fame_.\r\n\r\n  A few days since died Dr. Isaac Mann, Bishop of Cork and Ross, in\r\n  Ireland, and Archdeacon of Dublin. The Marquis of Buckingham by the\r\n  above event is singularly fortunate, by having it in his power during\r\n  the first week of his administration to bestow a mitre on one of his\r\n  chaplains.\r\n\r\n  The declining state of the King of _Spain_ naturally turns the\r\n  attention of political observers to that quarter--as a system of\r\n  measures very hostile to the views of _France_, and subversive of that\r\n  tyranny which it has so long exercised at the Court of _Madrid_, may\r\n  possibly be adopted. It is said, and the idea has long met with a\r\n  current belief, that the Prince of Austria is well acquainted with the\r\n  true interests of his country, and will when the power is his\r\n  effectually promote them.\r\n\r\n  The public events of Holland are known to every one who can and will\r\n  read the newspapers, but they alone who are able to get a peep into\r\n  private correspondence can be informed, though they will not all of\r\n  them _believe_, that _Lord Beauchamp_ is actually giving dinners--aye,\r\n  and good dinners too--at the _Hague_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _THE TIMES._\r\n\r\n  Why change the head?\r\n\r\n  This question will naturally come from the Public--and _we_ the TIMES,\r\n  being the PUBLIC’S most humble and most obedient Servants, think\r\n  ourselves bound to answer.\r\n\r\n  All things have _heads_--and all _heads_ are liable to _change_--\r\n\r\n  Every sentence and opinion advanced and supported by Mr. _Shandy_, on\r\n  the influence and utility of a well-chosen surname, may be properly\r\n  applied in shewing the recommendations and advantages which result\r\n  from placing a striking title-page before a book, or an inviting HEAD\r\n  on the front page of a NEWS-PAPER.\r\n\r\n  A HEAD so placed, like those _heads_ which once ornamented _Temple\r\n  Bar_, or those of the _Great Attorney_ or _Great Contractor_ which,\r\n  not long since, were conspicuously elevated for their _great actions_,\r\n  and were exhibited in _wooden frames_, at the _East_ and _West_-ends\r\n  of this metropolis, never fails of attracting the eyes of passengers,\r\n  though indeed we do not expect to experience the lenity shewn to these\r\n  _great exhibitors_; for probably THE TIMES will be pelted without\r\n  mercy.\r\n\r\n  But then a _head_ with a _good face_ is a harbinger or gentleman usher\r\n  that often strongly recommends even DULNESS, FOLLY, IMMORALITY, or\r\n  VICE--The immortal LOCKE gives evidence to the truth of this\r\n  observation. That great philosopher has declared that, though\r\n  repeatedly taken in, he never could withstand the solicitations of a\r\n  well-drawn title-page--authority sufficient to justify _us_ in\r\n  assuming a _new head_, with a _new set of features_, but not with a\r\n  design to impose; for we flatter ourselves the HEADS of THE TIMES will\r\n  not be found deficient in _intellects_, but by putting a _new face_ on\r\n  affairs, will be admired for the _light_ of its _countenance_ wherever\r\n  it appears.\r\n\r\n  To advert to our first position.\r\n\r\n  THE UNIVERSAL REGISTER has been a name as injurious to the\r\n  _Logographic News-Paper_ as TRISTRAM was to MR. SHANDY’S SON--but OLD\r\n  SHANDY forgot he might have rectified by _confirmation_ the mistake of\r\n  the _parson_ at _baptism_, and with the touch of a _Bishop_ have\r\n  changed TRISTRAM to TRISMEGESTUS.\r\n\r\n  THE UNIVERSAL REGISTER, from the day of its first appearance to the\r\n  day of its _confirmation_ has like TRISTRAM suffered from innumerable\r\n  casualities, both laughable and serious, arising from its _name_,\r\n  which on its introduction was immediately curtailed of its fair\r\n  proportion by all who called for it, the word _Universal_ being\r\n  _universally_ omitted, and the word _Register_, only, being retained.\r\n  “Boy, bring me the _Register_.” The waiter answers, “Sir, we have not\r\n  a library, but you may see it at the _New Exchange Coffee House_.”\r\n  “Then I’ll see it there,” answers the disappointed politician, and he\r\n  goes to the _New Exchange_ and calls for the _Register_; upon which\r\n  the waiter tells him he cannot have it if he is not a subscriber--or\r\n  presents him with the Court and City Register, the _Old Annual\r\n  Register_, or the _New Annual Register_; or if the Coffee House be\r\n  within the Purlieus of Covent Garden, or the Hundreds of Drury--slips\r\n  into the politician’s hand “_Harris’s Register_ of Ladies.”\r\n\r\n  For these and other reasons, the parents of the UNIVERSAL REGISTER\r\n  have added to its original name that of the\r\n\r\n  _TIMES,_\r\n\r\n  Which, being a _monosyllable_, bids defiance to _corrupters_ and\r\n  _mutilaters_ of the language.\r\n\r\n  THE TIMES! What a monstrous name! Granted--for THE TIMES _is_ a\r\n  many-headed monster that speaks with a hundred tongues, and displays a\r\n  thousand characters, and in the course of _its_ transformations in\r\n  life assumes innumerable shapes and humours.\r\n\r\n  The critical reader will observe we personify our _new name_, but as\r\n  we give it no distinction of sex, and though _it_ will be _active_ in\r\n  _its_ vocations, yet we apply to _it_ the _neuter gender_.\r\n\r\n  THE TIMES, being formed of materials and possessing qualities of\r\n  opposite and heterogeneous natures, cannot be classed either in the\r\n  animal or vegetable _genus_; but like the _Polypus_ is doubtful, and\r\n  in the discussion, description, dissection, and illustration, will\r\n  employ the pens of the most celebrated of the _Literati_.\r\n\r\n  THE HEADS OF THE TIMES, as has been said, are many; they will however\r\n  not always appear at the same time, but casually, as public or private\r\n  affairs may call them forth.\r\n\r\n  The principal or leading heads are--\r\n\r\n  The LITERARY,\r\n      POLITICAL,\r\n      COMMERCIAL,\r\n      PHILOSOPHICAL,\r\n      CRITICAL,\r\n      THEATRICAL,\r\n      FASHIONABLE,\r\n      HUMOUROUS,\r\n      WITTY, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n  Each of which are supplied with a competent share of intellects for\r\n  the pursuit of their several functions; an endowment which is not in\r\n  _all time_ to be found even in the HEADS of the _State_--The _heads_\r\n  of the _Church_--the _heads_ of the _Law_--the _heads_ of the\r\n  _Navy_--the _heads_ of the _Army_--and though _last_, not _least_, the\r\n  _great heads_ of the _Universities_.\r\n\r\n  The _Political Head_ of THE TIMES, like that of _Janus_, the Roman\r\n  Deity, is double faced; with one countenance it will smile continually\r\n  on the _friends_ of _Old England_, and with the other will frown\r\n  incessantly on her _enemies_.\r\n\r\n  The alteration we have made in our _head_ is not without precedents.\r\n  The WORLD has parted with half of its CAPUT MORTUUM and a moiety of\r\n  its brains. The HERALD has cut off half of its head, and has lost its\r\n  original humour. The POST, it is true, retains its whole head and its\r\n  old features; and as to the other public prints, they appear as having\r\n  neither _heads_ nor _tails_.\r\n\r\n  On the PARLIAMENTARY HEAD every communication that ability and\r\n  industry can produce may be expected. To this great _National object_\r\n  THE TIMES will be most sedulously attentive, most accurately correct,\r\n  and strictly impartial in its reports.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  THEATRE.\r\n\r\n  _Drury Lane._\r\n\r\n  Hamlet--whose doom, at least this season, has unfortunately been “to\r\n  walk the night and strut to empty benches”--performed yesterday\r\n  evening its accustomed _penance_ in lieu of Tamerlane.\r\n\r\n  Were not this excellent tragedy so often used “on the spur of the\r\n  occasion,” we think such admirable acting as Kemble’s Prince of\r\n  _Denmark_ would meet with more _attendance_--more of applause it could\r\n  not have.\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Ward’s performance of the _Queen_ is the best proof of Mrs.\r\n  Siddon’s assertion, that “Gertrude had more good points about her than\r\n  the critics were aware of.” Mrs. Ward’s distracted _look_ in the\r\n  closet scene aided most powerfully Kemble’s piteous exclamation of,\r\n  “On _him!_ on _him!_” Indeed, the noble delineation of that difficult\r\n  character did much credit to this rising actress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Covent Garden._\r\n\r\n  “Henry the Fourth,” with Ryder’s Falstaff, ended the year _merrily_ at\r\n  this Theatre. The house was remarkably full, and the lower boxes had\r\n  most of the fashionable _amateurs_ in town. The Falstaff of Ryder,\r\n  though not perfection, is yet respectable, and is the more welcome,\r\n  with “all its imperfections upon its head,” as disappointing the\r\n  general assertion that Falstaff _died_ with _Henderson_. Among the\r\n  most pleasing and prominent features were his address to the _gang_ on\r\n  Gadds Hill--“By the _Lord_, I _knew_ you”--to the Prince, and\r\n  soliloquy on _honour_. The description of his _company_ was also\r\n  replete with humour.\r\n\r\n  Edwin’s kind donation of the _sugar candy_ was particularly welcome to\r\n  Lewis, who was most villainously hoarse. The scene of Anon! anon! Sir,\r\n  of course lost much of its effect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  REHEARSAL OF NEW YEAR’S ODE.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Cramer led the band at the rehearsal yesterday, in _Hickford’s\r\n  Rooms, Brewer’s Street_. The Overture consisted of three movements, in\r\n  the second of which Mr. Parke’s oboe was distinguished in a Solo\r\n  accompanied by the Violincello. Mr. Sale opened the vocal part in a\r\n  recitative and air--\r\n\r\n    “Rude was the Pile, and massy Roof.”\r\n\r\n  He was followed by Doctor Hayes, who executed an air with great\r\n  applause. Master Carnaby, one of the King’s Boys, sung a verse\r\n  sweetly, beginning,\r\n\r\n    “When to the King.”\r\n\r\n  In the cantibile at the close, he rather failed in his execution,\r\n  which was very excusable in a first essay before so many capital\r\n  masters. A most rich and beautiful symphony preceded Mr. Dyne’s air.\r\n\r\n    “Proud Castle, to thy banner’d Bowers.”\r\n\r\n  It was much admired for its simplicity, it being conceived in the\r\n  captivating manner of the late Doctor Arne, with this addition, that\r\n  the accompanyments were much richer. The music finished with a very\r\n  powerful chorus, “Albion, arouse,” but there were not voices\r\n  sufficient to to do it justice.\r\n\r\n  The DUKE OF CUMBERLAND and near two hundred ladies and gentlemen were\r\n  present. Previous to the performance, the minuets for the Queen’s\r\n  birthday were as usual played over, two of which seemed to have a\r\n  considerable share of novelty and merit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _THE CUCKOO_\r\n\r\n  _Cuckoo! Cuckoo!_ Repeated the little piece of _machinery_ which LADY\r\n  WALLIS had conveyed into her _muff_, when she visited the COUNTESS OF\r\n  HUNTINGDON’S chapel. The _preacher_ raised up his eyes with amazement.\r\n  _Cuckoo!_ repeated the machine. “O word unpleasing to a married ear.”\r\n  Messrs. A., B., and C. rubbed their _foreheads_, and looked upon the\r\n  _preacher_. The _preacher_ went on with his discourse: “_fornicators\r\n  and adulterers_ shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.” _Cuckoo!_\r\n  repeated the machine. The _preacher_ proceeded till he came to another\r\n  quotation: “Saul! Saul! why persecutes thou me?” _Cuckoo!_ repeated\r\n  the machine.\r\n\r\n  LADY BRISTOL, more _notoriously_ known by her assumed title, the\r\n  DUCHESS OF KINGSTON, had lately been _seized_ with a longing to\r\n  revisit her native country. Her Ladyship declares she has for a\r\n  considerable time past felt the _amor patria_, and wishes for a\r\n  _private_ conversation with his Majesty’s Ministers, for the purpose\r\n  of laying before them the _true state_ of the Empress of Russia’s\r\n  _private affairs_.\r\n\r\n  We are rejoiced for the best reason in the world--because it will\r\n  promote the joy of others--that the report of _Mrs. Hobart_ having\r\n  retired from the _Richmond Theatre_ is entirely without foundation.\r\n  Where mirth, good humour, and elegant festivity prevail, especially if\r\n  they should be heightened by the comic scene, Mrs. _Hobart_ cannot be\r\n  easily spared.\r\n\r\n  On Friday evening, there was a private concert at the house of Mr.\r\n  Billington, in Poland Street, at which there were some of the\r\n  _first-characters_ in the kingdom. A more particular account of it\r\n  probably will be given in this paper on a future day.\r\n\r\n  Though clearing the gallery of the COMMONS of strangers be a _standing\r\n  order_, which any _member_ may insist upon without being seconded, yet\r\n  SIR GREGORY would not venture to put it in execution without\r\n  consulting his _Lady_: who, after examining the premises, has given\r\n  her opinion that _such things_ ought not to be _sported_ or _trifled_\r\n  with.\r\n\r\n  SIR THOMAS BEAVER and MAJOR MONEY have commenced _Literary\r\n  hostilities_, through the medium of the _Norwich Mercury_; their\r\n  ammunition is of inflammable materials--more, however, of _brimstone_\r\n  than of _salt_, and _charcoal_ in great abundance.\r\n\r\n  As this Paper has traced _every incident_ respecting LORD GEORGE\r\n  GORDON for several months past, it takes the liberty of announcing his\r\n  Lordship’s return to St. George’s Fields _early_ in the ensuing term.\r\n\r\n  LORD GEORGE GORDON is preparing to _beard_ Mr. ATTORNEY GENERAL on the\r\n  question of bail; and Mr. _Attorney_ on his part is preparing a\r\n  _cutting_ argument for _trimming Lord George_, but though his Lordship\r\n  has been so long in the _suds_, it is not thought that _shaving_ will\r\n  take place till _the day of Judgement_.\r\n\r\n  The paragraph which appeared in a certain respectable Morning Print,\r\n  relative to the discharge of a person from St. James’s, for having\r\n  paid a grateful attention to Lord George in his distresses is,\r\n  however, not true; indeed, the report was too _ungracious_ to be so.\r\n\r\n  O QUACKERY! where wilt thou end? O PHYSIC, when are thy disgraces to\r\n  terminate? There are at this time a practitioner in town, who says to\r\n  his patients--“Use my _wegetable_, follow my _regiment_, and never\r\n  fear it will _radicate_ all your _pectril_ complaints.” Such a\r\n  character should not escape the animadversion of THE TIMES; but of\r\n  _this here_ Doctor more anon--when _The Times_ have leisure.\r\n\r\n  Yesterday the Purser of the Dutton, Captain Hunt, for Bombay and\r\n  China, received his final dispatches from the India House.\r\n\r\n  It is really surprising that Bedford Street, one of the great leading\r\n  avenues to the Strand, should continue to remain in so confined a\r\n  state towards the bottom; it resembles a great bottle with a small\r\n  neck; there is not literally at its entrance from the Strand room for\r\n  two coaches to go abreast, yet forty yards higher it is roomy and\r\n  spacious. If the houses which form so great a bulk on the right hand,\r\n  where Cater the Pawnbroker now lives, were thrown down, and an elegant\r\n  range of new buildings to match the opposite corner, where Mess.\r\n  Humble and Henderson’s upholstery warehouse is, it would certainly be\r\n  equally commodious with either Catherine or Southampton Street.\r\n\r\n  During the late memorable contest between Johnson and Ryan, in the\r\n  last _set to_ Ryan trod upon Johnstone’s great toe, and by the\r\n  violence of the struggle lacerated the nail wholly from it. Johnstone\r\n  was at this instant observed to turn pale. When they were disengaged\r\n  Johnstone was so much irritated, that making a blow at Ryan, whom he\r\n  missed, he struck one of the uprights of the stage, which shook it in\r\n  an incredible manner, the next blow that Johnstone made was aimed at\r\n  the chest, in which he succeeded, and this terminated the contest.\r\n  Johnstone then asked Ryan if he had enough; to which he replied, “I’ve\r\n  had enough these six minutes, but to oblige my friends, I have _stood\r\n  up_.” Johnson’s hand was much bruised and black for some time after by\r\n  the blow against the upright, and we hear he has not yet recovered of\r\n  the hurt which his toe received in the encounter.\r\n\r\n  The spirit with which the Lord Mayor threatens the pack of _Bullock\r\n  Drivers_ in amongst the first fruits of his administration, which\r\n  promise it to be, as we hope it will prove, an administration of\r\n  effect. As for our part, we cannot be convinced that the power of the\r\n  magistracy in the metropolis and its suburbs is not equal to the\r\n  correction of the numerous disgraceful abuses which infect its\r\n  jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n  A tradesman of St Alban’s being asked why the King, after his fatigue\r\n  on Saturday, quitted the town with so much precipitation, replied with\r\n  some humour, “because his Majesty had no inclination to dine with\r\n  _Duke Humphrey_.”\r\n\r\n  Saturday morning, several of the felons in the New Goal in the Borough\r\n  made an attempt to escape, but were overheard by the Keeper, when two\r\n  of the principals were properly secured in the strong room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  This day is Published,\r\n  Price 1s. the book, and 8d. the sheet,\r\n  Elegantly printed in a size which may be enclosed in a\r\n  Pocket Book,\r\n\r\n  TRUSLER’S CLERICAL and UNIVERSAL ALMANACK for the year 1788.

SHERGOLD and CO. most respectfully offer their sincere Thanks\r\n  and grateful acknowledgements to a liberal and discerning Public for\r\n  the very great Measure of Confidence and Favours recently added to the\r\n  obligations they owe their Friends during a series of many Years and\r\n  upon repeated Occasions.\r\n\r\n  Without adopting the Parade and Nonsense which renders some of their\r\n  contemporaries ridiculous, they can make the best possible Appeal for\r\n  the Integrity and Honor of their actions--an Appeal to the Voice and\r\n  to the Judgment of the Public. They will not vaunt the Encouragement\r\n  and Preference they have received from all Ranks, but leave the World\r\n  to judge by Enquiry and the general Opinion how far they have\r\n  distanced all Competitors in extent of Business and of universal\r\n  Esteem.\r\n\r\n  THE success of their House to Adventurers has kept Pace with the\r\n  stability of its engagements. A great Number of CAPITAL PRIZES have\r\n  been added to their former numerous catalogue, and in particular a\r\n  5,000l., paid to a respectable Shopkeeper in the _Borough_, who will\r\n  readily bear Testimony to the Alacrity and Promptitude he experienced.\r\n\r\n  MESSRS.

Whereas, if the Act extended the time for a\r\n  certain number of weeks, there would be an opportunity for application\r\n  to be made for each respective share before the ticket could be\r\n  withdrawn.\r\n\r\n  To give, however, the friends of Hornsby and Co. every possible\r\n  confidence in the fairness and integrity of their transactions, and in\r\n  order to obviate the most distant suspicion of insecurity, they hereby\r\n  publicly declare and engage that every ticket which is shared by them\r\n  and deposited in the hands of the Commissioners, shall remain so\r\n  deposited for one whole calendar Month after the drawing of the\r\n  Lottery is finished, and that notwithstanding they will continue, as\r\n  they always have done, to pay upon demand every share of a prize that\r\n  may be drawn in the ensuing English Lottery, from a 20l. prize to a\r\n  20,000l.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  VICTUALLING OFFICE.\r\n\r\n  29th December, 1787.\r\n\r\n  _THE Commissioners for Victualling his Majesty’s Navy do hereby give\r\n  Notice, That there is money in the hands of the Treasurer of His\r\n  Majesty’s Navy to pay the Principal and Interest of the Bills\r\n  registered in the course of the Victualling for three months ending\r\n  the 31st of January, 1787, in order that the Persons possessed of such\r\n  Bills may bring them to this Office to be assigned for payment._\r\n\r\n  _And all persons who hold the said Bills are desired to subscribe\r\n  their names and places of abode at the bottom of each Bill._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  VICTUALLING OFFICE.\r\n\r\n  24th December, 1787.\r\n\r\n  _THE Commissioners for Victualling his Majesty’s Navy do hereby give\r\n  Notice, That, on Tuesday the 8th of January next, they will be ready\r\n  to receive Tenders in writing (sealed up), and treat with such persons\r\n  as will undertake to supply Fresh Beef and Sea Provisions to his\r\n  Majesty’s Ships and Vessels at Liverpool, which will be paid for by\r\n  Bills in Course._\r\n\r\n  _The Conditions of the Contract may be seen at the Secretary’s Office,\r\n  at this Office, or by applying to the Collector of His Majesty’s\r\n  Customs, at Liverpool._\r\n\r\n  _And all persons who may think proper to make Tenders upon the said\r\n  occasion are desired to take Notice, That, no Regard will be had to\r\n  any Tender that shall not be delivered before 1 o’clock on the said\r\n  8th January next, nor unless the Person who makes the Tender, or some\r\n  Person on his behalf, attends to answer for him when called for.

These Deputies have had an audience\r\n  at the last meeting of the Supreme Council, at which they solicited,\r\n  “That the King and Supreme Council would be pleased to devise means,\r\n  which by preventing famine, terminating the grievances of the\r\n  inhabitants, and quieting dissensions, might strengthen and give\r\n  efficacy to the resolutions of the nobility, the more so as these\r\n  resolutions are consonant to the principles of justice and equity.”\r\n\r\n  These Waywodes had a meeting in pursuance of these resolutions: “For\r\n  chusing an appointed place to establish a general magazine, to which\r\n  every person might bring whatever he possesses superfluous, and\r\n  deliver it to the Directors of the Stores. The Troops of the Republic\r\n  shall be provided for out of this general deposit of the country,\r\n  after which what remains will be sold to the Russians at the market\r\n  price, agreeable to the declaration of Count Romanzow, upon the entry\r\n  into Poland.”\r\n\r\n  Count Romanzow has taken possession of Talzyn, nine miles from the\r\n  frontiers of Turkey, and the army encamped in Poland under his command\r\n  will winter in the neighbourhood of that place. The Waywode of Russian\r\n  Lithuania, Count Petocki, has established his general quarters at\r\n  Mohibow.

R---- of Stanhope Street, presents his most respectful Compliments\r\n  to the Gentlemen who did him the honour of eating a couple of roasted\r\n  Chickens, drinking sundry tankards of ale, and three bottles of old\r\n  Madeira at his house, on Monday night.\r\n\r\n  In their haste they took away the Tankard, to which they are heartily\r\n  welcome; to the Tablespoons and the light Guineas which were in an old\r\n  red morocco pocket-book, they are also heartily welcome; but in the\r\n  said Pocket-book there were several loose Papers, which consisted of\r\n  private Memorandums, Receipts, etc. can be of no use to his kind and\r\n  friendly Visitors, but are important to him: he therefore hopes and\r\n  trusts they will be so polite as to take some opportunity of returning\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  For an old family Watch, which was in the same Drawer, he cannot ask\r\n  on the same terms; but if any could be pointed out by which he could\r\n  replace it with twice as many heavy Guineas as they can get for it, he\r\n  would gladly be the Purchaser.\r\n\r\n  W. R.\r\n\r\nA few nights after, a packet, with the following letter enclosed, was\r\ndropped into the area of the house: “Sir,--You are quite a gemman. Not\r\nbeing used to your Madeira, it got into our upper works, or we should\r\nnever have cribbed your papers; they be all marched back again with the\r\nred book. Your ale was mortal good; the tankard and spoons were made\r\ninto a white soup, in Duke’s Place, two hours afore daylite. The old\r\nfamily watch cases were at the same time made into a brown gravy, and\r\nthe guts, new christened, are on their voyage to Holland. If they had\r\nnot been transported, you should have them again, for you are quite the\r\ngemman; but you know, as they have been christened, and got a new name,\r\nthey would no longer be of your _old_ family. And soe, sir, we have\r\nnothing more to say, but that we are much obligated to you, and shall be\r\nglad to sarve and visit you, by nite or by day, and are your humble\r\nsarvants to command.” Honour had then, it would appear, not quite\r\ndeparted from among thieves.\r\n\r\nAt the end of last century a provincial attorney advertised an estate\r\nfor sale, or to be exchanged for another, stating that he was appointed\r\n_Plenipotentiary_ to _treat_ in the business; that he had ample\r\n_credentials_, and was prepared to _ratify his powers_; that he would\r\nenter into _preliminaries_ either upon the principle of the _statu quo_\r\nor _uti possidetis_; that he was ready to receive the _project_ of any\r\nperson desirous to make the purchase or exchange, and to deliver his\r\n_contre projet_ and _sine quâ non_, and, indeed, at once give his\r\n_ultimatum_, assuring the public that as soon as a _definitive treaty_\r\nshould be _concluded_, it would be _ratified_ by his constituent and\r\nduly _guaranteed_. He was evidently astonished at his own unexpected\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nSome curious and amusing statistics of advertising in the second year of\r\nthis century are given by Mr Daniel Stuart, at one time co-proprietor of\r\nthe _Morning Post_ with Coleridge, when it was in the meridian of its\r\nfame. He says: “The _Morning Herald_ and the _Times_, then leading\r\npapers, were neglected, and the _Morning Post_, by vigilance and\r\nactivity, rose rapidly. Advertisements flowed in beyond bounds. I\r\nencouraged the small miscellaneous advertisements in the front page,\r\npreferring them to any others, upon the rule that the more numerous the\r\ncustomers, the more independent and permanent the custom. Besides\r\nnumerous and various advertisements, I interest numerous and various\r\nreaders looking out for employment, servants, sales, and purchasers,\r\netc. etc. Advertisements act and react. They attract readers, promote\r\ncirculation, and circulation attracts advertisements. The _Daily\r\nAdvertiser_, which sold to the public for twopence halfpenny, after\r\npaying a stamp-duty of three-halfpence, never had more than half a\r\ncolumn of news; it never noticed Parliament, but it had the best foreign\r\nintelligence before the French Revolution. The _Daily Advertiser_ lost\r\nby its publication, but it gained largely by its advertisements, with\r\nwhich it was crammed full. Shares in it sold by auction at twenty years’\r\npurchase. I recollect my brother Peter saying, that on proposing to a\r\ntradesman to take shares in a new paper, he was answered with a sneer\r\nand a shake of the head--‘Ah! none of you can touch the _Daily_!’ It was\r\nthe paper of business, filled with miscellaneous advertisements,\r\nconducted at little expense, very profitable, and taken in by all\r\npublic-houses, coffee-houses, etc., but by scarcely any private\r\nfamilies. It fell in a day by the scheme of Grant, a printer, which made\r\nall publicans proprietors of a rival, the _Morning Advertiser_, the\r\nprofits going to a publicans’ benefit society; and they, of course, took\r\nin their own paper;--an example of the danger of depending on any class.\r\nSoon after I joined the _Morning Post_, in the autumn of 1795, Christie,\r\nthe auctioneer, left it, on account of its low sale, and left a blank, a\r\nruinous proclamation of decline. But in 1802 he came to me again,\r\npraying for readmission. At that time particular newspapers were known\r\nto possess particular classes of advertisements: the _Morning Post_,\r\nhorses and carriages; the _Public Ledger_, shipping and sales of\r\nwholesale foreign merchandise; the _Morning Herald_ and _Times_,\r\nauctioneers; the _Morning Chronicle_, books. All papers had all sorts of\r\nadvertisements, it is true, but some were more remarkable than others\r\nfor a particular class, and Mr Perry, who aimed at making the _Morning\r\nChronicle_ a very literary paper, took pains to produce a striking\r\ndisplay of book advertisements. This display had something more solid\r\nfor its object than vanity. Sixty or seventy short advertisements,\r\nfilling three columns, by Longman, one day, by Cadell, etc.,\r\nanother--‘Bless me, what an extensive business they must have!’ The\r\nauctioneers to this day stipulate to have all their advertisements\r\ninserted at once, that they may impress the public with great ideas of\r\ntheir extensive business. They will not have them dribbled out, a few at\r\na time, as the days of sale approach. The journals have of late years\r\nadopted the same rule with the same design. They keep back\r\nadvertisements, fill up with pamphlets, and other stuff unnecessary to a\r\nnewspaper, and then come out with a swarm of advertisements in a double\r\nsheet to astonish their readers, and strike them with high ideas of the\r\nextent of their circulation, which attracts so many advertisers. The\r\nmeagre days are forgotten, the days of swarm are remembered.”\r\n\r\nIn the same gossiping manner Stuart speaks again of this rage for\r\nswarming advertisements: “The booksellers and others crowded to the\r\n_Morning Post_, when its circulation and character raised it above all\r\ncompetitors. Each was desirous of having his cloud of advertisements\r\ninserted at once in the front page. I would not drive away the short,\r\nmiscellaneous advertisements by allowing space to be monopolised by any\r\nclass. When a very long advertisement of a column or two came, I charged\r\nenormously high, that it might be taken away without the parties being\r\nable to say it was refused admission. I accommodated the booksellers as\r\nwell as I could with a few new and pressing advertisements at a time.\r\nThat would not do: they would have the cloud; then, said I, there is no\r\nplace for the cloud but the last page, where the auctioneers already\r\nenjoy that privilege. The booksellers were affronted, indignant. The\r\nlast page! To obtain the accommodation refused by the _Morning Post_,\r\nthey set up a morning paper, the _British Press_; and to oppose the\r\n_Courier_, an evening one--the _Globe_. Possessed of general influence\r\namong literary men, could there be a doubt of success?” The _Globe_ has\r\nstood the test of time, and though it has seen vicissitudes, and has\r\nchanged its politics within recent years, it now seems as firmly\r\nestablished as any of its contemporaries that is independent of\r\nconnection with a morning paper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the end of our journey so far as the education of\r\nadvertisers and the development of advertisements are concerned. By the\r\ncommencement of the present century matters were very nearly as we find\r\nthem now; and so in the following chapters only those examples which\r\nhave peculiar claims to attention will be submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n_CURIOUS AND ECCENTRIC ADVERTISEMENTS._\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisements of the kind which form the subject of this chapter have\r\nbeen so often made matter of comment and speculation, have so often\r\nreceived the attention of essayists and the ridicule of comic writers,\r\nthat it is hard to keep out of the beaten track, and to find anything\r\nfresh to say upon a topic which seems utterly exhausted. Yet the store\r\nof fun is so great, and the excellence of many old and new stories so\r\nundoubted, that courage is easily found for this the most difficult part\r\nof the present work. Difficult, because there is an embarrassment of\r\nriches, an enormous mine of wealth, at command, and the trouble is not\r\nwhat to put in, but what to leave out, from a chapter on quaint and\r\ncurious advertisements. Difficult again, because some of the best\r\nstories have been told in so many and such various guises, that until\r\narriving at the ends it is hard to tell they have a common origin, and\r\nthen the claims of each version are as near as possible equal. There is,\r\nhowever, a way out of all difficulties, and the way in this is to verify\r\nthe advertisements themselves, and pay no attention to the apocrypha to\r\nwhich they give rise; and though it is a tedious proceeding, and one\r\nwhich shows little in return for the pains taken, it may be something to\r\nour readers to know, that curious as many of the specimens given are,\r\nthey are real and original, and that in the course of our researches we\r\nhave unearthed many impostures in the way of quotations from\r\nadvertisements which have never yet appeared, unless private views of\r\nstill more private copies of papers have been allowed their\r\npromulgators. There is, after all, little reason for a display of\r\ninventive power, for the real material is so good, and withal so\r\nnatural, as to completely put the finest fancy to a disadvantage. It has\r\nalready been remarked that in the whole range of periodical literature\r\nthere is no greater curiosity than the columns daily devoted to\r\nadvertisements in the _Times_. From them, says a writer a few years\r\nback, “the future historian will be able to glean ample and correct\r\ninformation relative to the social habits, wants, and peculiarities of\r\nthis empire. How we travel, by land or sea--how we live, and move, and\r\nhave our being--is fully set forth in the different announcements which\r\nappear in a single copy of that journal. The means of gratifying the\r\nmost boundless desires, or the most fastidious taste, are placed within\r\nthe knowledge of any one who chooses to consult its crowded columns.\r\nShould a man wish to make an excursion to any part of the globe between\r\nCape Horn and the North Pole, to any port in India, to Australia, to\r\nAfrica, or to China, he can, by the aid of one number of the _Times_,\r\nmake his arrangements over his breakfast. In the first column he will\r\nfind which ‘A 1 fine, fast-sailing, copper-bottomed’ vessel is ready to\r\ntake him to any of those distant ports. Or, should his travelling\r\naspirations be of a less extended nature, he can inform himself of the\r\nnames, size, horse-power, times of starting, and fares, of numberless\r\nsteamers which ply within the limits of British seas. Whether, in short,\r\nhe wishes to be conveyed five miles--from London to Greenwich--or three\r\nthousand--from Liverpool to New York--information equally conclusive is\r\nafforded him. The head of the second, or sometimes the third column, is\r\ninteresting to a more extensive range of readers--namely, to the\r\ncurious; for it is generally devoted to what may be called the romance\r\nof advertising. The advertisements which appear in that place are\r\nmysterious as melodramas, and puzzling as rebuses.” These incentives to\r\ncuriosity will receive attention a little further on; meanwhile we will\r\nturn to those which are purely curious or eccentric.\r\n\r\nThe record of these notices to the public is so extensive, and its\r\nramifications so multifarious, that so far as those advertisements which\r\nsimply contain blunders are concerned, we must be satisfied with a\r\nsimple summary, and in many cases leave our readers to make their own\r\ncomments. Here is a batch of those whose comicality is mainly dependent\r\nupon sins against the rules of English composition. We will commence\r\nwith the reward offered for “a keyless lady’s gold watch,” which is,\r\nthough, but a faint echo of the “green lady’s parasol” and the “brown\r\nsilk gentleman’s umbrella” anecdotes; but the former we give as actually\r\nhaving appeared, while so far the two latter require verification. A\r\nlady advertises her desire to obtain a husband with “a Roman nose having\r\nstrong religious tendencies.” A nose with heavenly tendencies we can\r\nimagine, but even then it would not be Roman. “A spinster particularly\r\nfond of children,” informs the public that she “wishes for two or three\r\nhaving none of her own.” Then a dissenter from grammar as well as from\r\nthe Church Established wants “a young man to look after a horse of the\r\nMethodist persuasion;” a draper desires to meet with an assistant who\r\nwould “take an active and energetic interest in a small first-class\r\ntrade, and in a quiet family;” and a chemist requests that “the\r\ngentleman who left his stomach for analysis, will please call and get\r\nit, together with the result.” Theatrical papers actually teem with\r\nadvertisements which, either from technology or an ignorance of literary\r\nlaw, are extremely funny, and sometimes alarming, and even the editorial\r\nminds seem at times to catch the infection. One of these journals, in a\r\npuff preliminary of a benefit, after announcing the names of the\r\nperformers and a list of the performances, went on: “Of course every one\r\nwill be there, and for the edification of those who are absent, a full\r\nreport will be found in our next paper.” This is worthy of a place in\r\nany collection: “One pound reward--Lost, a cameo brooch, representing\r\nVenus and Adonis on the Drumcondra-road, about ten o’clock, on Tuesday\r\nevening.” And so is this: “The advertiser, having made an advantageous\r\npurchase, offers for sale, on very low terms, about six dozen of prime\r\nport wine, late the property of a gentleman forty years of age, full in\r\nthe body and with a high bouquet.” The lady spoken of in the following\r\nwould meet with some attention from the renowned Barnum: “To be sold\r\ncheap, a splendid grey horse, calculated for a charger, or would carry a\r\nlady with a switch tail.” But she would find a formidable rival in the\r\ngentleman whose advertisement we place as near as possible, so as to\r\nmake a pair: “To be sold cheap, a mail phaeton, the property of a\r\ngentleman with a moveable head, as good as new.” Students of\r\nvivisection, and lovers of natural history generally, would have been\r\nglad to meet with this specimen of life after decapitation: “Ten\r\nshillings reward--Lost by a gentleman, a white terrier dog, except the\r\nhead, which is black.” And as congenial company we append this: “To be\r\nsold, an Erard grand piano, the property of a lady, about to travel in a\r\nwalnut wood case with carved legs.”\r\n\r\nDiffering somewhat, though still of the same kind, is the advertisement\r\nof a governess, who, among other things, notifies that “she is a perfect\r\nmistress of her own tongue.” If she means what she says, she deserves a\r\ngood situation and a high rate of wages. An anecdote is told of a\r\nwealthy widow who advertised for an agent, and, owing to a printer’s\r\nerror, which made it “a gent,” she was inundated with applications by\r\nletter, and pestered by personal attentions. This story requires,\r\nhowever, a little assistance, and may be taken for what it is worth. Not\r\nlong ago, a morning paper contained an announcement that a lady going\r\nabroad would give “a medical man” £100 a year to look after “a\r\nfavourite spaniel dog” during her absence. This may not be funny, but it\r\nis certainly curious, and in these days, when starvation and misery are\r\nrampant, when men are to be found who out of sheer love kill their\r\nchildren rather than trust them to the tender mercies of the parish\r\nofficials, and when these same officials are proved guilty of\r\nconstructive homicide, it is indeed noticeable. A kindred advertisement,\r\nalso real and unexaggerated, asks for “an accomplished poodle nurse.\r\nWages £1 per week.” This has double claims upon our attention here, for\r\nin addition to the amount offered for such work, there is a doubt as to\r\nthe actual thing required. Is it a nurse for accomplished poodles, or an\r\naccomplished nurse? And, if the latter, what in the name of goodness and\r\ncommon sense is accomplishment at such work? Do poodles require peculiar\r\nnursery rhymes and lullabies, or are they nursed, as a vulgar error has\r\nit about West-country babies, head downwards? This is not the exact\r\nexpression used with regard to the infants; but it will do. We will\r\nconclude this short list of peculiarities with two which deserve notice.\r\nThe first is the notice of a marriage, which ends, “No cards, no cake,\r\nno wine.” This is evidently intended for friends other than those “at a\r\ndistance,” whose polite attention is so constantly invoked. The\r\nremaining specimen appeared in the _Irish Times_, and runs thus: “To\r\nInsurance Offices.--Whatever office the late William H. O’Connell, M.D.\r\nlife was insured will please to communicate or call on his widow, 23\r\nSouth Frederick Street, without delay.” One hardly knows which to admire\r\nmost, the style or the _insouciance_ of the demand.\r\n\r\nOf curious advertisements which are such independent of errors,\r\nselfishness, or moral obliquity, we have in the purely historical part\r\nof this work given plenty specimens from olden times; but there are\r\nstill a few samples of the peculiarities of our ancestors which will\r\nbear repetition in this chapter, more especially as most of them have\r\nnot before been unearthed from their original columns. Before quoting\r\nany of those which are purely advertisements in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe word, we will present to our readers a curious piece of puffery\r\nwhich appeared in an Irish paper for May 30, 1784, and which from its\r\nnear connection with open and palpable advertising, and from its\r\nwhimsical character, will not be at all out of place, and will doubtless\r\nprove interesting, especially to those of a theatrical turn of mind, as\r\nit refers to the gifted Sarah Siddons’s first appearance in Dublin. The\r\narticle runs thus: “On Saturday, Mrs Siddons, about whom all the world\r\nhas been talking, exposed her beautiful, adamantine, soft, and lovely\r\nperson, for the first time, at Smock-Alley Theatre, in the bewitching,\r\nmelting, and all-tearful character of _Isabella_. From the repeated\r\npanegyrics in the impartial London newspapers, we were taught to expect\r\nthe sight of a heavenly angel; but how were we supernaturally surprised\r\ninto the most awful joy, at beholding a mortal goddess. The house was\r\ncrowded with hundreds more than it could hold,--with thousands of\r\nadmiring spectators, that went away without a sight. This extraordinary\r\nphenomenon of tragic excellence! this star of Melpomene! this comet of\r\nthe stage! this sun of the firmament of the Muses! this moon of blank\r\nverse! this queen and princess of tears! this Donnellan of the poisoned\r\nbowl! this empress of the pistol and dagger! this chaos of Shakspeare!\r\nthis world of weeping clouds! this Juno of commanding aspects! this\r\nTerpsichore of the curtains and scenes! this Proserpine of fire and\r\nearthquake! this Katterfelto of wonders! exceeded expectation, went\r\nbeyond belief, and soared above all the natural powers of description!\r\nShe was nature itself! She was the most exquisite work of art! She was\r\nthe very daisy, primrose, tuberose, sweet-brier, furze-blossom,\r\ngilliflower, wall-flower, cauliflower, auricula, and rosemary! In short,\r\nshe was the bouquet of Parnassus! Where expectation was raised so high,\r\nit was thought she would be injured by her appearance; but it was the\r\naudience who were injured:--several fainted before the curtain drew up!\r\nWhen she came to the scene of parting with her wedding-ring, ah! what a\r\nsight was there! the very fiddlers in the orchestra, ‘albeit, unused to\r\nthe melting mood,’ blubbered like hungry children crying for their bread\r\nand butter; and when the bell rang for music between the acts, the tears\r\nran from the bassoon players’ eyes in such plentiful showers, that they\r\nchoked the finger stops; and making a spout of the instrument, poured in\r\nsuch torrents on the first fiddler’s book, that, not seeing the overture\r\nwas in two sharps, the leader of the band actually played in one flat.\r\nBut the sobs and sighs of the groaning audience, and the noise of corks\r\ndrawn from the smelling-bottles, prevented the mistake between flats and\r\nsharps being discovered. One hundred and nine ladies fainted! forty-six\r\nwent into fits! and ninety-five had strong hysterics! The world will\r\nscarcely credit the truth, when they are told, that fourteen children,\r\nfive old women, one hundred tailors, and six common-councilmen, were\r\nactually drowned in the inundation of tears that flowed from the\r\ngalleries, the slips, and the boxes, to increase the briny pond in the\r\npit; the water was three feet deep; and the people that were obliged to\r\nstand upon the benches, were in that position up to their ankles in\r\ntears! An Act of Parliament against her playing any more will certainly\r\npass.” As this effusion appeared almost immediately after the famous\r\nactress’s first appearance, we are hardly wrong in considering it as\r\nhalf an advertisement. It must certainly have helped to draw good houses\r\nduring the rest of her stay.\r\n\r\nLovers of the gentle craft maybe interested to know that what was\r\nperhaps the earliest advertisement of Izaak Walton’s famous little book\r\n“The Compleat Angler” was published in one of Wharton’s Almanacs. It is\r\non the back of the dedication-leaf to “Hemeroscopeion: Anni Æra\r\nChristianæ, 1654.” Hemeroscopeion was William Lilly, and the almanac\r\nappeared in 1653, the year in which Walton’s book was printed. The\r\nadvertisement says:--\r\n\r\n  There is published a Booke of Eighteen-pence price, called _The\r\n  Compleat Angler_, Or, _The Contemplative man’s Recreation_: being a\r\n  Discourse of Fish and Fishing. Not unworthy the perusall. Sold by\r\n  _Richard Marriot_ in S. _Dunstan’s_ Church-yard, _Fleetstreet_.\r\n\r\nThe publication of births, marriages, and deaths seems to have begun\r\nalmost as soon as newspapers were in full swing. At first only the names\r\nof the noble and eminent were given, but soon the notices got into much\r\nthe same form as we now find them. One advantage of the old style was\r\nthat the amount a man died worth was generally given, though how the\r\nexact sum was known directly he died passes our comprehension, unless it\r\nwas then the fashion to give off the secret with the latest breath. Even\r\nunder such circumstances we should hesitate to believe some people of\r\nour acquaintance, who have tried now and again, but have never yet\r\nsucceeded in telling the truth about their own affairs or those of their\r\nrelatives. And doubtless many an heir felt sadly disappointed, on taking\r\nhis property, to find it amount to less than half of the published sum.\r\nNotices of marriages and deaths were frequent before the announcement of\r\nbirths became fashionable; and in advertisements the real order of\r\nthings has been completely changed, as obituaries began, marriages\r\nfollowed, and births came last of all. In the first number of the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_, January 1731, we find deaths and marriages\r\npublished under separate heads, and many papers of the time did\r\nlikewise. The _Grub Street Journal_ gave them among the summary of\r\nDomestic News, each particular item having the initials of the paper\r\nfrom which it was taken appended, as was done with all other information\r\nunder the same head; for which purpose there was at the top of the\r\narticle the information that C. meant _Daily Courant_, P. _Daily\r\nPost-Boy_, D. P. _Daily Post_, D. J. _Daily Journal_, D. A. _Daily\r\nAdvertiser_, S. J. _St James’s Evening Post_, W. E. _Whitehall Evening\r\nPost_, and L. E. _London Evening Post_. In the number for February 7,\r\n1734, we find this:--\r\n\r\n  _Died_ last night at his habitation in Pall-mall, in a very advanced\r\n  age, count Kilmanseck, who came over from Hanover with King George I.\r\n  _S. J._--At his lodgings. _L. E._ _D. A. Feb. 1._--Aged about 70. _P.\r\n  Feb. 1._----Of the small-pox, after 8 days illness, in his 23d year\r\n  count Kilmansegg, son of the countess of Kilmansegg, who came over\r\n  from Hanover the beginning of the last reign. _D. P. Feb. 1._--He came\r\n  over with his highness the prince of Orange, as one of his gentlemen.\r\n  _D. J. Feb. 1._--_Tho’_ Mr Conundrum _cannot_ account _for these\r\n  different_ accounts _of these two_ German counts, _yet he_ counts _it\r\n  certain, that the younger_ count _was the_ son of the countess, who\r\n  came over _from the_ county _of_ Hanover.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time we find in the same paper another paragraph worthy\r\nof notice:--\r\n\r\n  _Died_, last week at Acton, George Villers, Esq; formerly page of the\r\n  preference to queen Anne, said to have died worth 30,000l.--Mr Ryley,\r\n  a pay-master serjeant, as he was drinking a pint of beer at the Savoy.\r\n  _D. J._--On friday Mr Feverel, master of the bear and rummer tavern in\r\n  Gerard-street, who was head cook to king William and queen Anne,\r\n  reputed worth 40,000l. _P._--Mr Favil. _D. P._--Mr Favel. _D. J._--Mr\r\n  Fewell, 21,000l. _D. A._\r\n\r\nOn March 14, also of 1734, there is this:--\r\n\r\n  _Died_ on tuesday in Tavistock-street, Mr Mooring, an eminent mercer,\r\n  that kept Long’s warehouse, said to have died worth 60,000l. _D.\r\n  J._--_This was 5 days before he did die, and_ 40,000l. _more than he_\r\n  died worth _according to_ D. P. _Mar. 12_.\r\n\r\nAnd on the 28th this:--\r\n\r\n  _Died_ yesterday morning admiral Mighelles. _C._--Mighells.\r\n  _P._--Mighills. _D. P._--A gentleman belonging to the earl of Grantham\r\n  was found dead in his bed. _P._\r\n\r\nAnd so on, there being announcements in every number, many of which\r\nshowed differences in the daily-paper notices. There are also plenty of\r\nmarriage announcements, which, as a rule, give the amounts obtained with\r\nthe ladies, and sometimes the gentlemen’s fortunes. The following is\r\nfrom the _G. S. J._ of February 21, 1734:--\r\n\r\n  _Married_, yesterday at S. James’s church by the right rev. Dr Hen.\r\n  Egerton, lord bishop of Hereford, the hon. Francis Godolphin, of\r\n  Scotland-yard, Esq; to the 3d daughter of the countess of Portland, a\r\n  beautiful lady of 50,000l. fortune. _P._--Will. Godolphin, Esq; to the\r\n  lady Barbara Bentinck, &c. _D. P._--At the chapel-royal, at S.\r\n  James’s: youngest daughter, &c. _D. J._ _D. A._\r\n\r\nA few weeks later on there is this:--\r\n\r\n  _Married_ this day the countess of Deloraine, governess to the\r\n  princesses Mary and Louisa, to Will. Wyndham, Esq; son to the late\r\n  col. Wyndham. _L. E._--_They were not_ married _’till_ 10 at night.\r\n\r\nAnd on April 25 this:--\r\n\r\n  _Married_ a few days since -- Price, a Buckinghamshire gentleman of\r\n  near 2000l. per ann. to miss Robinson of the Theatre Royal in\r\n  Drury-lane. _L. E._--On tuesday, the lord Visc. Faulkland to the lady\r\n  Villew, relict of the late lord Faukland, a lady of great merit and\r\n  fortune. _D. P._--Mr Price’s marriage is entirely false and\r\n  groundless. _D. A. Ap. 24._\r\n\r\nThere are in the _Journal_, as well as in contemporary and earlier\r\npapers, occasional references to births as well, but none calling for\r\nany comment at our hands. In the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ of February 1736\r\nthere are two notices of deaths, one commencing the list, which is\r\ncurious, and the other immediately following, which cannot fail to be\r\ninteresting:--\r\n\r\n  SIR _Brownlowe Sherard_, Bt in _Burlington_ Gardens. He was of a human\r\n  Disposition, kind to his Servants dislik’d all extravagant Expence,\r\n  but very liberal of his Fortune, as well to his Relations and Friends,\r\n  as to Numbers of distressed Objects; and in particular, to St.\r\n  _George’s_ Hospital, near _Hyde-Park Corner_.\r\n\r\n  _Bernard Lintott_, Esq., formerly an eminent Bookseller in\r\n  _Fleet-street_. High Sheriff for Sussex, aged 61.\r\n\r\nAlso the Earl of Derby, and several men who are noted to have died worth\r\nsums varying from £13,000 to £100,000, find obituary notices. These give\r\nparticulars of the lives of the deceased, and the ways in which the\r\nvarious properties are disposed of, very different from the short\r\nannouncements of modern days. Thus we find that by the death of the Hon.\r\nWalter Chetwynd, the barony of Rathdown in the county of Dublin, and\r\nviscounty of Chetwynd of Beerhaven in the county of Cork, both in the\r\npeerage of Ireland, became extinct, but that his brother, John Chetwynd,\r\nwas consoled by an estate of £3000 per annum; that Mrs Eliza Barber\r\nsuccumbed to “an illness she had contracted in Newgate on a prosecution\r\nof her master, a baronet of Leicestershire, of which being honourably\r\nacquitted, and a copy of her indictment granted, she had brought an\r\naction of £1000 damages;” that Mr Fellows was an eminent sugar-baker;\r\nand that Gilbert Campbell had during his life got himself into trouble\r\nfor misinterpreting his duties as an attorney. The marriage lists have\r\nalso the admirable fashion of giving the sums of money obtained with the\r\nbrides or bridegrooms as the case may be, and in some instances the\r\namounts of revenue.\r\n\r\nIn the _London Journal_ of February 7, 1730, there is the following,\r\nwhich shows that the presentation of advertisement-books gratis is by no\r\nmeans a novelty:--\r\n\r\n  _At the_ New Masquerade Warehouse _in_ Henrietta Street, Covent\r\n  Garden, _are given gratis_.\r\n\r\n  PRINTED Speeches, Jokes, Jests, Conundrums and smart Repartees, suited\r\n  to each Habit, by which Gentlemen and Ladies may be qualified to speak\r\n  what is proper to their respective Characters. Also some Dialogues for\r\n  two or more Persons, particularly between a Cardinal and a Milkmaid; a\r\n  Judge and a Chimney-sweeper; a Venetian Courtezan and a Quaker; with\r\n  one very remarkable between a Devil, a Lawyer and an Orange Wench. At\r\n  the same place is to be spoke with Signor ROSARIO, lately arrived from\r\n  Venice, who teaches Gentlemen and Ladies the behaviour proper for a\r\n  Devil, a Courtezan, or any other Character. And whereas it is a\r\n  frequent practice for Gentlemen to appear in the Habits of Ladies, and\r\n  Ladies in the habits of Gentlemen, Signor ROSARIO teaches the Italian\r\n  manner of acting in both capacities. The Quality of both Sexes may be\r\n  waited on and instructed at their Houses.\r\n\r\nAlso in 1730 two Roman histories, translated from the French by two\r\nJesuit priests, appeared at the same time--one by Mr Ozell, the other by\r\nMr Bundy--which caused the following advertisement to be inserted by the\r\npublishers of Ozell’s work:--\r\n\r\n  ^This Day is Publish’d^\r\n\r\n  _What will satisfy such as have bought Mr Ozell’s Translation of the_\r\n  ROMAN HISTORY, _and also undeceive such of Mr Bundy’s Friends as are\r\n  more Friends to Truth:_\r\n\r\n  _Number I._ of the\r\n\r\n  HERCULEAN LABOUR: or the AUGÆAN STABLE cleansed of its heaps of\r\n  historical, philological, and Geographical Trumpery. Being Serious and\r\n  facetious Remarks by Mr Ozell, on some thousands of capital and\r\n  comical Mistakes, Oversights, Negligences, Ignorances, Omissions,\r\n  Misconstructions, Mis-nomers and other Defects, in the folio\r\n  Translation of the ROMAN HISTORY by the Rev. Mr BUNDY.\r\n\r\n  A witty Foreigner upon reading an untrue Translation of Cæsar’s\r\n  Commentaries, said: “It was a wicked Translation, for the Translator\r\n  had not rendered unto Cæsar the things which were Cæsar’s.”\r\n\r\n  With equal truth tho’ less wit, may it be said the Translator of the\r\n  ROMAN HISTORY has not paid the Rev. authors the TYTHE of their DUES;\r\n  which in one of the same cloth is the more unpardonable.\r\n\r\n  The Money is to be returned by Mr Ozell, to any Gentleman, who, after\r\n  reading it shall come (or send a letter to him in Arundel Street, in\r\n  the Strand) and declare upon Honour, he does not think the Book worth\r\n  the Money.\r\n\r\nIn the _Bristol Gazette_ for Thursday, August 28, 1788, among\r\nadvertisements of the ordinary kind, some of which are noticeable as\r\nemanating from Robert and Thomas Southey, we find the following:--\r\n\r\n  _Swansea_ and _Bristol_ DILIGENCE,\r\n  To carry THREE INSIDES.\r\n\r\n  WILL set out from the Mackworth-Arms, _Swansea_, on Wednesday the 18th\r\n  of June, and continue every Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday morning at\r\n  four o’clock; and will arrive early the same evening at the New\r\n  Passage, where a good boat will be waiting to take the Passengers\r\n  over, and a Coach ready at eight o’clock the next morning to carry\r\n  them to _Bristol_.\r\n\r\n  Also a LIGHT COACH will set out every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday\r\n  afternoon at five o’clock, from the WHITE LION, to meet the above\r\n  Diligence.\r\n\r\n  Fare from Bristol to Swansea 1l. 10s., passage included.\r\n\r\n  Short passengers the same as the Mail Coach.\r\n\r\n  N.B.--Parcels carried on moderate terms, and expeditiously delivered;\r\n  but no parcels will be accounted for above 5l. value, unless entered\r\n  as such and paid for accordingly.\r\n\r\n  Performed by\r\n  J. LAKE, Mackworth-Arms, Swansea.\r\n  C. NOTT, Ship and Castle, Neath.\r\n  C. BRADLEY, Bear, Cowbridge.\r\n  J. BRADLEY, Angel, Cardiff.\r\n  M. HOGGARD, New Passage.\r\n  R. CHURCH, New Passage.\r\n  W. CARR, White Lion, Bristol.\r\n\r\n  N.B. A COACH every Monday, Thursday, and Saturday morning, at seven\r\n  o’clock, from the White Lion to the New Passage.\r\n\r\nIt is to be presumed that the line about short passengers refers to\r\nthose who travel short journeys only, though a friend of ours, himself a\r\nWelshman, makes several jocular allusions to the conditions that used in\r\nthe days of travelling by road in and about the Principality to be\r\nimposed on people of less than the average height. As these will be some\r\nday published in a volume, the title of which is already decided\r\nupon--“Cheese and Chuckles; or, Leeks and Laughter”--and which is\r\nintended for distribution among the bards at the annual Eisteddfod, we\r\nwill not discount the sensation then to be derived from their\r\npublication, more especially as we have tried in vain and failed to\r\nunderstand them.\r\n\r\nFor those who take such interest in the poet Southey that anything\r\nconnected with his family is regarded with favour, we present the\r\nfollowing, from the same number of the _Bristol Gazette_, which was\r\nkindly forwarded by a gentleman on hearing that this work was in\r\nprogress:--\r\n\r\n  DISSOLUTION OF PARTNERSHIP.\r\n\r\n  THE PARTNERSHIP between ROBERT and THOMAS SOUTHEY, _Linen-drapers_,\r\n  &c., of this city, was by mutual consent dissolved on the 21st of July\r\n  last; all persons to whom the said partnership stood indebted, are to\r\n  send their accounts to ROBERT SOUTHEY, Wine-street, and the persons\r\n  indebted to them, are respectfully requested to pay the same to the\r\n  said ROBERT SOUTHEY, who continues the trade as usual.\r\n\r\n  ROBERT SOUTHEY.\r\n  THOMAS SOUTHEY.\r\n\r\n  BRISTOL, August 8th, 1788.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  R. SOUTHEY, thanks his friends in particular and the public in\r\n  general, for the kind support he has hitherto experienced, and begs\r\n  leave to inform them, that he is just returned from London with a\r\n  large assortment of goods; particularly fine printed CALLICOES,\r\n  MUSLINS, and LACE, which he is determined to sell on as low terms as\r\n  any person in the trade, and solicits the early inspection of his\r\n  friends.\r\n\r\n  N.B.--Part of the old Stock to be sold very cheap.\r\n\r\nThere is also an advertisement in the paper from Thomas Southey, who has\r\ntaken up quarters in Close Street, soliciting custom and describing his\r\nwares. Our correspondent, who is a gentleman of position at Neath, and\r\nwhose veracity is undoubted, says: “My father was a correspondent of\r\nSouthey’s, and in one of his letters Southey says he was very nearly\r\nsettling in our Vale of Neath, in a country house, the owner of which\r\nwas a strong Tory, but as Southey at that early period of his life was a\r\ngreat Radical, he was not allowed to rent the property! If this had not\r\nbeen so, he says, ‘my children would have been _Cam_brian instead of\r\n_Cum_brian.’”\r\n\r\nAmong other old customs now fast falling into desuetude, there is in\r\nCumberland and some other parts of the north of England a practice known\r\nas the Bridewain, which consists of the public celebration of weddings.\r\nA short time after courtship is commenced--as soon as the date of the\r\nmarriage is fixed--the lovers give notice of their intentions, and on\r\nthe day named all their friends for miles around assemble at the\r\nintending bridegroom’s house, and join in various pastimes. A plate or\r\nbowl is generally fixed in a convenient place, where each of the company\r\ncontributes in proportion to his inclination and ability, and according\r\nto the degree of respect the couple are held in. By this custom a worthy\r\npair have frequently been benefited with a sum of from fifty to a\r\nhundred pounds. The following advertisement for such a meeting is copied\r\nfrom the _Cumberland Pacquet_, 1786:--\r\n\r\n  INVITATION.\r\n\r\n    Suspend for one day your cares and your labours,\r\n    And come to this wedding, kind friends and good neighbours.\r\n\r\n  NOTICE is hereby given that the marriage of ISAAC PEARSON with FRANCES\r\n  ATKINSON will be solemnized in due form in the parish church of\r\n  Lamplugh, in Cumberland, on Tuesday next, the 30th of May inst.;\r\n  immediately after which the bride and bridegroom with their attendants\r\n  will proceed to Lonefoot, in the said parish, where the nuptials will\r\n  be celebrated by a variety of rural entertainments.\r\n\r\n              Then come one and all\r\n              At Hymen’s soft call\r\n    From Whitehaven, Workington, Harrington, Dean,\r\n    Hail, Ponsonby, Blaing and all places between,\r\n    From Egremont, Cockermouth, Barton, St Bee’s,         }\r\n    Cint, Kinnyside, Calder and parts such as these;

a girdle (_ceinture de Venus_) possessing qualities not\r\n  to be described; and many other articles, sports and pastimes too\r\n  numerous to mention, but which can never prove tedious in the\r\n  exhibition.\r\n\r\n    From fashion’s laws and customs free,\r\n    We follow sweet variety;\r\n    By turns we laugh and dance and sing;\r\n    Time’s for ever on the wing;\r\n    And nymphs and swains of Cumbria’s plain\r\n    Present the golden age again.\r\n\r\nA similar advertisement appears in the _Pacquet_ in 1803, and contains\r\nsome verses of a kind superior to that generally met in these appeals.\r\nIt is called\r\n\r\n  A PUBLIC BRIDAL.\r\n\r\n  JONATHAN and GRACE MUSGRAVE purpose having a PUBLIC BRIDAL at Low\r\n  Lorton Bridge End, near Cockermouth, on THURSDAY, the 16th of June,\r\n  1803; when they will be glad to see their Friends, and all who may\r\n  please to favour them with their Company;--for whose Amusement there\r\n  will be various RACES, for Prizes of different kinds; and amongst\r\n  others, a Saddle, and Bridle; and a Silver-tipt Hunting Horn, for\r\n  Hounds to run for.--There will also be Leaping, Wrestling, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n  ☞ Commodious ROOMS are likewise engaged for DANCING PARTIES, in the\r\n  Evening.\r\n\r\n    Come, haste to the BRIDAL!--to Joys we invite You,\r\n      Which, help’d by the Season, to please You can’t fail:\r\n    But should LOVE, MIRTH, and SPRING strive in vain to delight You,\r\n      You’ve still the _mild_ Comforts of LORTON’S sweet VALE.\r\n\r\n    And where does the GODDESS more charmingly revel?\r\n      Where ZEPHYR dispense a more health-chearing Gale,\r\n    Than where the pure _Cocker_, meandring the Level,\r\n      Adorns the calm Prospects of LORTON’S sweet VALE?\r\n\r\n    To the BRIDAL then come;--taste the Sweets of our Valley;\r\n      Your Visit, _good Cheer_ and _kind Welcome_ shall hail.\r\n    Round the _Standard_ of OLD ENGLISH CUSTOM, we’ll rally,--\r\n      And be blest in _Love_, _Friendship_, and LORTON’S sweet VALE.\r\n\r\nA correspondent, writing in Hone’s Table-Book, date August 1827, says it\r\nwas in the early part of the century “a prevalent custom to have ‘bidden\r\nweddings’ when a couple of respectability and of slender means were on\r\nthe eve of marriage; in this case they gave publicity to their\r\nintentions through the medium of the _Cumberland Pacquet_, a paper\r\npublished at Whitehaven, and which about twenty-nine years ago was the\r\nonly newspaper printed in the county. The editor, Mr John Ware, used to\r\nset off the invitation in a novel and amusing manner, which never failed\r\nto insure a large meeting, and frequently the contributions made on the\r\noccasion, by the visitors, were of so much importance to the new-married\r\ncouple that by care and industry they were enabled to make so good ‘a\r\nfend as niver to look ahint them.’” That this or a similar custom was\r\npractised commonly a generation ago in Wales, where it is even now\r\noccasional, a notice issued from Carmarthen shows. It is peculiar, and\r\nruns thus:--\r\n\r\n  CARMARTHEN, April 12, 1836.\r\n\r\n  AS we intend to enter the MATRIMONIAL STATE on THURSDAY, the 5th of\r\n  MAY next, we are encouraged by our Friends to make a BIDDING on the\r\n  occasion the same Day, at the Sign of the ANGEL, situate in\r\n  LAMMAS-STREET; when and where the favour of your good and agreeable\r\n  Company is most humbly solicited, and whatever donation you may be\r\n  pleased to confer on us then, will be thankfully received, warmly\r\n  acknowledged, and cheerfully repaid whenever called for on a similar\r\n  occasion,\r\n\r\n  By your most obedient humble Servants,\r\n\r\n  DAVID DANIEL\r\n  (Shoemaker,)\r\n\r\n  RUTH EVANS.\r\n\r\n  THE Young Man, and his Mother, (Mary Daniel,) and his Brother and\r\n  Sister (Joshua and Anne,) desire that all gifts of the above nature\r\n  due to them, be returned on the said Day, and will be thankful for all\r\n  favours granted.\r\n\r\n  Also, the Young Woman, and her Mother (Sarah Evans,) and her\r\n  Grand-father and Grand-mother (John and Frances Evans,) desire that\r\n  all Gifts of the above nature due to them, be returned on the above\r\n  Day, and will be thankful with her Uncle and Aunt (Benjamin and\r\n  Margaret Evans, Penrhywcoion,) for all additional favours granted.\r\n\r\nThe applications made by means of the notes which follow the\r\nadvertisement show that the promise made by David and Ruth to repay all\r\namounts when called upon is something more than a mere flourish. We\r\nshould not like, though, to guarantee that these promises were always\r\nkept, and have no doubt that the concocters of the foregoing found, as\r\nso many others did before them, and not a few have done since, that\r\nkindness is generally obtained from the least expected, and often the\r\nleast valued, quarter. This is a glorious dispensation of providence,\r\nand few people who have experienced misfortune, or have been in want of\r\nassistance, but have felt how compensating is the hidden power which\r\nguides our destinies. Yet writers who constantly rail about the\r\ninsincerity of friendship make little or no mention of those truest\r\nfriends, the friends who appear uninvoked, and do whatever has been\r\nasked in vain of others who may have promised freely, or who are in fact\r\nindebted to those they ignore in the moment of adversity.\r\n\r\nBurly old Grose, the friend of Burns, in his “Olio” gives a curious\r\nspecimen of composition, which he says was the effort of a mayor in one\r\nof our University towns, though which is not stated. It tells us that--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS, a Multiplicity of Dangers are often incurred by Damage of\r\n  outrageous Accidents by Fire, we whose Names are undersigned, have\r\n  thought proper that the Benefit of an Engine, bought by us, for the\r\n  better Extinguishing of which, by the Accidents of Almighty God, may\r\n  unto us happen, to make a Rate to gather Benevolence for the better\r\n  propagating such useful Instruments.\r\n\r\nSome clever student of style may be able to tell, by a clue invisible\r\nto the uninitiated, whether this is Oxford or Cambridge. We are not\r\nlearned in such matters, and so prefer to admire, without troubling\r\nourselves to identify.\r\n\r\nPoetical advertisements were not at all uncommon a hundred years ago and\r\nless. The demand for space, and the steam-engine rate at which we live\r\nnow, have, however, destroyed not only the opportunity for them, but\r\ntheir use. Towards the close of the last century there lived in the\r\nCanongate, Edinburgh, one Gavin Wilson, a hard-working bootmaker, or, as\r\nhis sign described him, “Arm, Leg and Boot maker, _but not_ to his Royal\r\nHighness the Prince of Wales.” He was a singular fellow, and was the\r\ninventor of an art for hardening and polishing leather, so as to be\r\nworkable into powder-flasks, snuff-boxes, drinking-mugs, ink-cases, and\r\nother articles of a similar kind. His genius did not stop at this rough\r\nwork, but enabled him to form a German flute and a violin, both of\r\nleather, which, for neatness of workmanship and melodiousness of tone,\r\nwere, friendly critics said, not a bit inferior to any fiddle or flute\r\nformed of wood. His greatest triumphs, however, were artificial arms and\r\nlegs, also made of leather, which not only completely remedied loss of\r\nlimb, but also closely resembled their human prototypes, being covered\r\nwith skin, nails, &c. The unexampled success of his endeavours in this\r\nway was curiously illustrated by a person who, having lost both his\r\nhands by a cannon-shot, was provided with a new and useful pair by Gavin\r\nWilson. This man expressed his gratitude in a letter of thanks, written\r\nwith the artificial hands, which appeared in the _Caledonian Mercury_\r\nfor 1779, along with an advertisement of the ingenious mechanic. Wilson\r\nhad also pretensions to wit, and was occasionally a votary of what Foote\r\nonce described as the Tuneful Ten. “Nine and one are ten,” said Foote\r\none day to an accountant, who was anxious the wit should hear his\r\npoetry, and who commenced, “Hear me, O Phœbus and ye Tuneful Nine!”\r\nHaving got so far, he accused Foote of inattention; but the latter\r\nsaid, “Nine and one are ten--go on,” which was too near the shop to be\r\npleasant. The following advertisement may serve as a specimen of\r\nWilson’s poetical attempts:--\r\n\r\n    G. Wilson humbly as before\r\n    Resumes his thankfulness once more\r\n    For favours formerly enjoy’d\r\n    In, by the public, being employ’d.\r\n    And hopes this public intimation\r\n    Will meet with candid acceptation.\r\n    The world knows well he makes _boots_ neatly\r\n    And, as times go, he sells them cheaply.\r\n    ’Tis also known to many a hundred\r\n    Who at his late invention wonder’d,\r\n    That polish’d _leather boxes_, _cases_,\r\n    So well known now in many places,\r\n    With _powder-flasks_ and _porter-mugs_,\r\n    And jointed _leather arms_ and _legs_.\r\n    Design’d for use as well as show,\r\n    _Exempli gratia_ read below,[34]\r\n    Were his invention; and no claim\r\n    Is just by any other name.\r\n    With numbers of production more,\r\n    In leather ne’er performed before.\r\n    In these dead times being almost idle,\r\n    He tried and made a _leather fiddle_.\r\n    Of workmanship extremely neat,\r\n    Of tone quite true, both soft and sweet.\r\n    And finding leather not a mute\r\n    He made a _leather German flute_,\r\n    Which play’d as well and was as good\r\n    As any ever made of wood.\r\n    He for an idle hour’s amusement\r\n    Wrote this exotic advertisement,\r\n    Informing you he does reside\r\n    In head of Canongate, south side,\r\n    Up the first wooden-railed stair,\r\n    You’re sure to find his Whimship there.\r\n    In Britain none can fit you better\r\n    Than can your servant the _Bootmaker_.\r\n\r\n  GAVIN WILSON.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that their day is past, occasional poetical\r\nadvertisements are to be found in the papers now. They are, as a rule,\r\ninfinitely bad, and the following is so very different from the general\r\nrun of them, that we cannot help quoting it. Perhaps it was written\r\nafter taking a dose of “Lamplough,” which is said on authority to have\r\nso many beneficial effects, that power over writers of verse in general,\r\nand the writer of the following in particular, may easily be included\r\namong them. So all minor poets had better study this, which we extract\r\nfrom a “weekly” a year or so ago:--\r\n\r\n  A DRINKING SONG.\r\n\r\n    IF ever your spirits are damp, low,\r\n      And bilious; you should, I opine,\r\n    Just quaff a deep bumper of Lamplough--\r\n      Of Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline.\r\n\r\n    The title is quaint and eccentric--\r\n      Is probably so by design--\r\n    But they say for disturbances ventric\r\n      There’s nought like Pyretic Saline.\r\n\r\n    Don’t bid me become exegetic,\r\n      Or tell me I’m only a scamp low,\r\n    If I can tell you more of Pyretic\r\n      Saline manufactured by Lamplough.\r\n\r\nA second good specimen was published in a theatrical paper at the time\r\nwhen Mr J. S. Clarke, an American comedian, whose strength is in his\r\nadvertisements, and who is well known this side the Atlantic, was\r\nplaying in “The Rivals.” It is entitled\r\n\r\n  SAVED.\r\n\r\n    IT was a chill November eve and on the busy town\r\n    A heavy cloud of yellow fog was sinking slowly down;\r\n    Upon the bridge of Waterloo, a prey to mad despair,\r\n    There stood a man with heavy brow and deep-lined face of care.\r\n\r\n    One ling’ring look around he gave, then on the river cast\r\n    That sullen stare of rash resolve he meant should be his last.\r\n    Far down the old cathedral rose, a shadow grey and dim,\r\n    The light of day would dawn on that but ne’er again on him.\r\n\r\n    One plunge within the murky stream would end the bitter strife.\r\n    “What rest’s there now,” he sobbed aloud, “to bid me cling to life?”\r\n    Just then the sound of stamping feet smote on his list’ning ear,\r\n    A sandwich-man upon his beat paused ’neath the lamplight clear.\r\n\r\n    One hurried glance--he read the board that hung upon his back,\r\n    He leapt down from the parapet, and smote his thigh a smack.\r\n    “I must see that,” he cried--the words that put his woe to flight\r\n    Were “John S. Clarke as Acres at the Charing Cross to-night.”\r\n\r\nAnother of these effusions, well worthy of insertion here, appeared\r\nquite recently in a humorous paper, and is devoted to the interests of\r\nMessrs Cook & Son, the tourist agents. Whether or not it was paid for as\r\nan advertisement, they must have found it valuable. Despite the sneers\r\nof several small wits whom fortune has enabled to travel in the old\r\nexpensive mode, there are very many who are neither cads nor snobs,\r\nwhatever the distinction may be, and whose greatest sin is a paucity of\r\nincome, that have felt the benefit of the popular excursionists’\r\nendeavours. The verses are called\r\n\r\n  COOK’S PERQUISITES.\r\n\r\n    In longitude six thousand ninety-two,\r\n      Latitude nothing, the good ship, _Salt Beef_,\r\n    Caught in a gale, the worst that ever blew,\r\n      Was stranded on a coral island’s reef.\r\n\r\n    Her back was broken, so she went in halves,\r\n      The crew and captain perished, every hand;\r\n    Only a pig, some chickens, and two calves,\r\n      And the one passenger, escaped to land.\r\n\r\n    King Bungaroo, with all the royal suite,\r\n      Was waiting to receive him on the beach;\r\n    And seeing he was plump and nice to eat,\r\n      Received him graciously with courteous speech.\r\n\r\n    The suite, who thus their coming banquet eyed,\r\n      Their gastric regions rubbed with grateful paw,\r\n    And wondered if the king would have him fried,\r\n      Or boiled, or roasted,--or just eat him raw!\r\n\r\n    The hungry passenger their meaning caught\r\n      As hinting dinner in some manner dim,\r\n    And smiling at the notion, little thought\r\n      That they meant feasting _on_--and not _with_--him!\r\n\r\n    But, as you draw a fowl before ’tis drest,\r\n      The suite proceeded first, of everything\r\n    The pockets of their victim to divest,\r\n      And laid their plunder down before the king.\r\n\r\n    The monarch started at some object there--\r\n      Then seized the prisoner’s hand and cried aloud,\r\n    “Bo, bingo wobli! Chungum raggadare.\r\n      Howinki croblob? Boo! Owchingadowd!”\r\n\r\n    Which means--“Unhand this kindly gentleman.\r\n      Observe those coupons! Note that small green book!\r\n    Put out the fire--hang up the frying-pan!\r\n      We mustn’t eat him. He belongs to Cook!”\r\n\r\nBut turning back to the early times on which we started in quest of\r\namusing advertisements, we come upon a fictitious letter addressed to\r\nSylvanus Urban in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for September 1803, which\r\nis signed Maria Elderly, and falls sadly foul of the indecorous\r\nannouncements then so plentiful. It runs thus: “Good Mr Urban,--You must\r\nknow, Sir, I am a married woman and a mother (I bless Heaven!) of\r\nseveral not unpromising daughters. We read most of the best English and\r\nFrench authors together as we sit at our work: that is to say one reads\r\naloud whilst the rest draw, sew, or embroider. The hours thus pass more\r\npleasantly; and our amusement I will hope is productive of solid mental\r\nprofit. It is a proverbial good-natured joke with young gentlemen that\r\ncuriosity is of the feminine gender. I will not stop to dispute the\r\nmatter with such acute grammarians; but will rather honestly admit that\r\n(although I think otherwise) perhaps ‘much may be said on both sides.’\r\nNay, I will own, Sir, that what with the natural timidity of my sex, and\r\nthe fear of Bonaparte’s invasion, I do feel a little hankering or so, to\r\nlearn how the world of politics is conducted. I therefore have lately\r\ntaken in a certain fashionable morning newspaper, and was much amused at\r\nfirst with its contents. But, my dear Mr Urban, I fancy I must give up\r\nthis paper; and as I find you are a married gentleman, I will at once\r\ntell you why: I have often been vexed, Sir, at the sight of certain\r\nindecorous advertisements. Proof is better than accusation at all times.\r\nI will therefore just allude to a few, which, however, I assure you, are\r\nnot the worst. I know you cannot expect _me_ to transcribe them. The\r\nfirst instance I shall notice, is in the paper of April 21, 1803, where\r\n‘a lady near 30, wishes to be companion to a single gentleman;’ and as a\r\nproof of the impropriety of this advertisement, Mr O. of Dover Street\r\n(to whom the _lady_ referred) thought it necessary pointedly to deny all\r\nknowledge of her in another advertisement of April 28. In the paper of\r\nMay 5, I read that ‘a widow-lady _pleasing in her person_, &c., solicits\r\nthe loan of £40 from a gentleman.’ The lady refers to a house in Dean\r\nStreet, Soho. In that of May 26 ‘a young female intreats the loan of\r\n£130 from a nobleman or gentleman of fortune.’ She refers to Curriers’\r\nRow, Black friars. In that of June 1, a young lady (who refers to the\r\npost-office, Blandford Street, Portman Square) inserts a most\r\nunqualified proposal indeed. In that of June 16, the proposal is\r\nrepeated in still more impertinent terms. The lady now refers to Eyre\r\nStreet, Hatton Garden. In that of June 18, appear two advertisements\r\nfrom females, _of a very curious nature_, addressed to two young men.\r\nBoth are assignations; and they are expressed too in very intelligible\r\nterms, I do assure you. I believe you will agree with me that such\r\nadvertisements can do no good and may do much harm. I could enlarge my\r\nlist very greatly, by pointing your eyes to paragraphs of a later date;\r\nbut the subject is a very unpleasant one, and I at present forbear. ‘My\r\npoverty, but not my will consents’ may do in a play; but it is a sad\r\nexcuse for the editor of a daily publication: and it is _criminal_, Sir,\r\nwhen we consider how many young minds may thus be empoisoned.” We trust\r\nthis letter will be taken as evidence that we have in the preceding\r\nchapter by no means selected the worst specimens of the style which\r\npervaded advertisements at the close of the last century and beginning\r\nof the present.\r\n\r\nThe believers in vested interests may see by an advertisement of the\r\nyear 1804, that proprietorial rights were respected in those days even\r\namong beggars:--\r\n\r\n  TO be disposed of for the benefit of the poor widow a Blind Man’s WALK\r\n  in a charitable neighbourhood, the comings-in between twenty-five and\r\n  twenty-six shillings a week, with a dog well drilled, and a staff in\r\n  good repair. A handsome premium will be expected. For further\r\n  particulars, inquire at No. 40, Chiswell Street.\r\n\r\nThe halcyon days of cadgers and crossing-sweepers are over, and we no\r\nlonger hear of members of either profession leaving fortunes. It has\r\noften been source of wonder to us how a right was maintained in any\r\nparticular crossing or walk. It is presumable, of course, that no action\r\nwould lie in the event of one man taking another’s favourite corner;\r\nyet, if story-tellers are to be depended upon, the “good-wills” of these\r\nplaces in days gone by were worth not hundreds alone, but thousands of\r\npounds. The new police and the mendicity societies have considerably\r\ndisturbed such sinecures, and even those affectionate parents that of\r\nlate years lived on the earnings of their young, who pretended to sell\r\ncigar-lights and newspapers, but who in reality begged freely, have been\r\ndriven to earn their own meals by the officers of the various\r\nschool-boards. So passes away the glory of free trade from this\r\nover-legislated and effete old country, where no one is allowed to do as\r\nhe likes if it at all interferes with the comfort of his\r\nneighbours--except, of course, when he is rich and the neighbour is\r\npoor. Passing on to 1811, we come upon a quaint request for a servant in\r\nthe _Morning Post_ of December 4:--\r\n\r\n  A COOK-HOUSEMAID, or HOUSEMAID-COOK is wanted, for the service of a\r\n  single gentleman, where only one other, a manservant is kept. The age\r\n  of the woman wanted must not be less than 25, nor more than 40 years;\r\n  and it is requisite that she should be equally excellent in the two\r\n  capacities of Cook and Housemaid. Her character must be\r\n  unexceptionable for sobriety, honesty and cleanliness. The sobriety,\r\n  however, which consists in drinking deep without staggering will not\r\n  do; nor will the honesty suffice which would make up for the possible\r\n  absence of pilfering by waste. Neither will the cleanliness answer\r\n  which is content with bustling only before the employer’s eyes--a sure\r\n  symptom of a slattern. The servant advertised for, must be thoroughly\r\n  and truly cleanly, honest and sober. As it is probable that not a drab\r\n  out of place who reads this advertisement but will be for imposing\r\n  herself, though, perhaps, incapable of cooking a sprat, and about as\r\n  nice as a Hottentot, all such are warned not to give themselves\r\n  useless trouble. On the other hand, a steady, clean woman, really\r\n  answering the above description, will, by applying as below, hear of a\r\n  place not easy equalled in comfort; where the wages are good and\r\n  constantly increasing, and where servants are treated as\r\n  fellow-creatures, and with a kindness, which, to the discredit of\r\n  their class, is seldom merited. Personal application to be made, from\r\n  one to three o’clock, to Mr Danvers, perfumer, No. 16, Craven Street,\r\n  Strand.\r\n\r\nHere we have the crotchety old bachelor of the novels to the life. This\r\nadvertiser was evidently a judge of character, and doubtless one of the\r\nkindest-hearted of men, but irascible and touchy, subject to twinges of\r\ngout, and possessed of a horror of east winds. A man who would scorn to\r\nbe affected by the most pitiful story, yet whose hand was always in his\r\npocket, and whose sympathy always meant relief as well. Where are all\r\nthese good old creatures gone? Are they all dead, and is the race\r\nextinct? Frankly we must admit that we never met with any one of them,\r\nthough we should very much like to, as we could in our own person find\r\nplenty of opportunity for the disposition of extra benevolence. It is\r\nsaid that the brothers Cheeryble had an actual existence, and perhaps\r\nthey had, but if so, they managed to conceal their identity extremely\r\nsuccessfully. We remember once meeting two brothers in business, who in\r\nappearance and manner were exactly like Nickleby’s benefactors; but two\r\nmore astute individuals were not to be found in the three kingdoms. And\r\non the strength of this likeness they possessed a great reputation for a\r\nbenevolence which never had even a symptom of real being. Apropos of\r\nthose imaginary philanthropists the Cheerybles, we present one of the\r\nadvertisements which were called forth by their appearance in the story.\r\nIt is from the _Times_, and was published February 7, 1844:--\r\n\r\n  TO THE BROTHERS CHEERYBLE, or any who have hearts like theirs. A\r\n  clergyman, who will gladly communicate his name and address, desires\r\n  to introduce the case of a gentleman, equal at least to Nickleby in\r\n  birth, worthy, like him, for refinement of character, even of the best\r\n  descent; like him, of spotless integrity, and powerfully beloved by\r\n  friends who cannot help him, but no longer, like Nickleby, sustained\r\n  by the warm buoyancy of youthful blood. The widowed father of young\r\n  children, he has spent his all in the struggles of an unsuccessful but\r\n  honourable business, and has now for eighteen months been vainly\r\n  seeking some stipendiary employment.--To all who have ever known him\r\n  he can refer for commendation. Being well versed in accounts, though\r\n  possessed of education, talents, and experience, which would render\r\n  him invaluable as a private secretary, he would accept with gratitude\r\n  even a clerk’s stool and daily bread. Any communication addressed to\r\n  the Rev. B. C., Post-office, Cambridge, will procure full particulars,\r\n  ample references, and the introduction of the party, who is now in\r\n  town, and ignorant of this attempt to serve him.\r\n\r\nDickens, knowing his power at that time, must have laughed in his sleeve\r\nat the trick he was playing the professional swindler when he portrayed\r\nthe brothers; though, if we are to believe what we are told in the\r\npreface to a subsequent edition of his book, the noble army of\r\nbegging-letter writers and suchlike impostors had ample revenge, for he\r\nwas pestered nearly to death with importunities to reveal the real name\r\nand address of purely mythical characters. Inventors of appeals to the\r\nbenevolent, either by way of letter or advertisement, are a hard-working\r\nrace, and must find the task of enlisting sympathy much more difficult\r\nthan it was when Mr Puff tided over a time of misfortune by aid of the\r\ncharitable and credulous. It is possible even now, despite the efforts\r\nof societies and detectives who give themselves entirely to the work of\r\nunmasking counterfeits, to find one or two of those heart-stirring\r\nappeals to the benevolent which have maintained many an impostor in\r\nidleness for years together. Like Puff did in his time, though\r\nevidently less and less successfully, these advertisers support\r\nthemselves upon their inventions by means of the proceeds of addresses\r\n“to the charitable and humane,” or “to those whom providence has blessed\r\nwith affluence.” The account which Puff gives of his fictitious\r\nmisfortunes so little exaggerates the advertisements which appear\r\noccasionally in the _Times_, that it is well to the point, and worthy of\r\nquoting. “I suppose,” he says, “never man went through such a series of\r\ncalamities in the same space of time. I was five times made a bankrupt,\r\nand reduced from a state of affluence by a train of unavoidable\r\nmisfortunes. Then, though a very industrious tradesman, I was twice\r\nburnt out, and lost my little all both times. I lived upon those fires a\r\nmonth. I soon after was confined by a most excruciating disorder, and\r\nlost the use of my limbs. That told very well; for I had the case\r\nstrongly attested, and went about to collect the subscriptions myself!\r\nAfterwards, I was a close prisoner in the Marshalsea for a debt\r\nbenevolently contracted to serve a friend. I was then reduced to--oh\r\nno!--then I became a widow with six helpless children. Well, at last,\r\nwhat with bankruptcies, fires, gouts, dropsies, imprisonments, and other\r\nvaluable calamities, having got together a pretty handsome sum, I\r\ndetermined to quit a business which had always gone rather against my\r\nconscience.”\r\n\r\nBut leaving “The Critic,” and the ideas which the specimens just given\r\nhave promoted, we will fall back upon an advertisement of a truly\r\nhumorous nature, which is given to the world as long back as 1816. What\r\nhouseholder who has improved his dwelling for the benefit of a grasping\r\nproprietor will not sympathise with the writer of this?--\r\n\r\n  WANTED IMMEDIATELY, to enable me to leave the house which I have for\r\n  these last five years inhabited, in the same plight and condition in\r\n  which I found it, 500 LIVE RATS, for which I will gladly pay the sum\r\n  of £5 sterling; and as I cannot leave the farm attached thereto in the\r\n  same order in which I got it, without at least Five Millions of\r\n  Docks, Dockens (weeds), I do hereby promise a further sum of £5 for\r\n  said number of Dockens. Apply ----.\r\n\r\n  Dated, 31 October, 1816.\r\n\r\n  N.B. The Rats must be full grown, and no cripples.\r\n\r\nIn close companionship with the above we find another, which for\r\npeculiarity is quite as noticeable. The advertiser has evidently studied\r\nhumanity without receiving much benefit from his researches, unless the\r\nknowledge that he is vastly superior to every one else is a benefit. If\r\nthe advertisement were not a swindle, of which it seems very suggestive,\r\nit is not unreasonable to suppose that failure attended upon it, for no\r\nman who believed to such an extent in himself could ever be brought to\r\nhave faith in another:--\r\n\r\n  IT is the general desire of princes and opulent men to live\r\n  friendless--they gain obsequiousness, adulation, and dependents, but\r\n  not friends: the sycophants that surround them disappear when the lure\r\n  that attracted them is lost: beguiled by blandishments, deceived by\r\n  hypocrisy, and lulled by professions they do not discover imposture\r\n  till adversity detects it. The evil is unbounded--they never obtain a\r\n  sincere opinion, whether regarding pecuniary embarrassment or domestic\r\n  dissension--in any perplexed or unhappy event they receive no counsel\r\n  but that which benefits the sinister views of him who gives it. Of\r\n  what advantage is fortune if it transforms friends into parasites, and\r\n  we are to live in constant delusion; or isolated and secluded, we must\r\n  exist like hermits to shun intercourse with our fellow-beings, and\r\n  escape perfidy? One whose affluence precludes speculation, who has\r\n  proved himself undaunted in danger and unshaken in fidelity, proffers\r\n  his friendship to him who deserves it, and will know how to appreciate\r\n  it;--his reading has not afforded mere abstract knowledge, but has\r\n  been rendered auxiliary for a vast intercourse with the world; years\r\n  have furnished experience, reflection has improved it. His advice and\r\n  aid he hopes is not insignificant, be the station of him who requires\r\n  them ever so elevated. As there can be no independence where there is\r\n  not equality of circumstances, no one of inferior condition can be\r\n  noticed.\r\n\r\nStill about the same period we come upon the advertisement of an Irish\r\nschoolmaster, which for inflation, pomposity, and ignorance is perhaps\r\nunrivalled. It is only fair, while quoting this, to say that Mr Hendrick\r\nis not by any means a good specimen of the Irish teacher, who is, as a\r\nrule, modest, conscientious, and chokeful of learning. This extract\r\nforcibly reminds us of one of Samuel Lover’s characters:--\r\n\r\n  MR HENDRICK’S DEVOIR TO THE GENTRY OF LIMERICK.\r\n\r\n  WOULD be elated to assign his attention for the instruction of eight\r\n  or ten Pupils, to attend on their houses each second day, to teach the\r\n  French language, Geography on the Principles of Astronomy, traversing\r\n  the Globe by sea and land on the rudiments of a right angle, with a\r\n  variety of pleasing Problems, attached to Manners, Customs, &c. of\r\n  different Countries, Trade and Commerce; Phenomenons on Volcanos,\r\n  Thunder, Sound, Lightning, &c. Such as please to continue, may advance\r\n  through a Course of Natural Philosophy, and those proficient in French\r\n  can be taught the above in that Language.\r\n\r\n  N.B. At intervals would instruct in the Italian Language.\r\n\r\n  Please to inquire at Mr Barry, Newtown-Perry.\r\n\r\n  J. HENDRICK, _Philomathos_.\r\n\r\nIn a Jersey newspaper for December 1821 there is a very funny\r\nadvertisement for a lost dog--so funny indeed is it that it seems more\r\nthan likely to have been a hoax, or a hit at the peculiarly broken\r\nEnglish identified with the Channel Islands. Still it appears as an\r\nadvertisement, and so we append it:--\r\n\r\n  LOSE.--Dere ave bin von doge, dat vil replay to de appel of “Outre;”\r\n  he is betwin de couleur of de vite and de bruin, dere is belif he was\r\n  delay by some personne on propos, as he was vont by de oner on Monday\r\n  next for to come to de chasse, as he kno vere was de hairs. Applie of\r\n  de oner at de Printure.\r\n\r\nAs a companion, here is the following from the _Handelsblad_ of\r\nAmsterdam. It is much more natural than the Jersey effusion, and is\r\nevidently an attempt to write the language known on the Continent and\r\nabroad generally as American. It will be recollected that one of the\r\nlast requests of the Emperor Nicholas during the Crimean war was that,\r\nin gratitude for the efforts at assistance made by the good people of\r\nthe United States, the cadets in the military schools should be taught\r\nthe American language. This must be near to his idea of it:--\r\n\r\n  MEDAILLE of SILVER at New-York.\r\n\r\n  MEDAILLE of GOLD at Paris, London and Berlin.\r\n\r\n  The very celebrated AMERICAN-BALSAM, notwithstanding the great\r\n  competition, preserve the preference; wherefore, did is your question\r\n  because every body is content with his expectation and recommend this\r\n  balsam indeed.\r\n\r\n  The under signed have by experience of himself following the working\r\n  of this balsam and may be rejoicing to offer an his honorables\r\n  fellow-citizens and compatriots a very excellent remedy to prevent the\r\n  sally of hair, to dissiporte the erysipelas; and than the greatest\r\n  desire of man consist to recover the hair upon their bald-spates, it\r\n  is reading every day in the newspapers, but none annonce, as the under\r\n  signed has the right to do it with contract _NO HAIR NO MONNEY_.\r\n\r\n  The prevent imitation none than THEOPHILE is sole agent for the\r\n  Netherlands, St. Nicholasstreet at Amsterdam.

Perriwigs! curls,\r\n  tress shall be dying very beautiful is every colours, of light haired\r\n  to black.\r\n\r\n  Bony inspection of a long wigt tress, with teen differents coleurs.\r\n\r\nOn December 23, 1823, the following droll advertisement appeared in the\r\n_Morning Herald_. It was probably a satire on the manners and customs of\r\nquasi-fashionables of the day, though why any one should be so anxious\r\nto mark his disapprobation of the state of affairs as to pay for the\r\npublication of his satires we really are not prepared to say:--\r\n\r\n  WANTED, for the ensuing London Campaign, a CHAPERON, who will\r\n  undertake the charge of two young ladies, now making their entrée into\r\n  fashionable life; she must possess a constitution impervious to\r\n  fatigue and heat, and be perfectly independent of sleep; _au fait_ at\r\n  the mysteries of Whist and Cassino, and always ready to undertake a\r\n  round game, with a supper appetite of the most moderate description:\r\n  any personal charms, which might interfere by her acting as a foil to\r\n  her charges, will be deemed inadmissible; and she must be totally\r\n  divested of matrimonial pretensions on her own account, having\r\n  sufficient experience in the _beau monde_ to decide with promptitude\r\n  on the eligibility of invitations with an instinctive discrimination\r\n  of Almack men, and eldest sons. Address to Louisa, Twopenny Post\r\n  Office, Great Mary-le-bone-street.\r\n\r\n  N.B. No Widow from Bath or Cheltenham will be treated with.\r\n\r\nIn the _Times_, at the close of the year 1826, an advertisement\r\nappeared, which ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n  TO SCHOOL ASSISTANTS.--Wanted, a respectable GENTLEMAN of good\r\n  character, capable of TEACHING the CLASSICS as far as Homer and\r\n  Virgil. Apply ----\r\n\r\nThere is nothing noticeable in this, the reader will think, nor is\r\nthere; but the sequel, which is told in a number of the now leading\r\njournal a few days afterwards, will perhaps repay perusal. A day or two\r\nafter the advertisement had appeared, the gentleman to whom application\r\nwas to be made received a letter as follows: “Sir--With reference to an\r\nadvertisement which were inserted in the _Times_ newspaper a few days\r\nsince, respecting a school assistant, I beg to state that I should be\r\nhappy to fill that situation; but as most of my frends reside in London,\r\nand not knowing how far Homer and Virgil is from town, I beg to state\r\nthat I should not like to engage to teach the classics farther than\r\nHammersmith or Turnham Green, or at the very utmost distance farther\r\nthan Brentford.--Wating your reply, I am, Sir, &c. &c., John Sparks.”\r\nThe errors in orthography and syntax have been copied as in the letter,\r\nbut we fancy the matter looks suspiciously like a hoax. The editor,\r\nhowever, thinks otherwise, and after appending a few remarks, says,\r\n“This puts us in mind of a person who once advertised for a ‘_strong\r\ncoal heaver_,’ and a poor man calling upon him the day after, saying,\r\n‘he had not got such a thing as a _strong coal heaver_, but he had\r\nbrought a _strong coal scuttle_, made of the best iron; and if that\r\nwould answer the purpose, he should have it a bargain.’” About this time\r\nthe following request for a minister was published in the _Monthly\r\nMirror_, and doubtless applications were numerous for the engagement:--\r\n\r\n  WANTED, for a newly erected Chapel, near Grosvenor Square, a gentleman\r\n  of elegant manners, and insinuating address, to conduct the\r\n  theological department to a refined audience. It is not necessary that\r\n  he believe in the Thirty-nine Articles; but it is expected that he\r\n  should possess a white hand and a diamond ring; he will be expected to\r\n  leave out vulgar ideas, and denunciations against polite vices which\r\n  he may meet with in the Bible; and, upon no account, be guilty of\r\n  wounding the ears of his auditory with the words h----ll, or d----n.\r\n  One who lisps, is near-sighted, and who has a due regard for amiable\r\n  weaknesses, will be preferred.\r\n\r\n  N.B.--If he is of pleasing and _accommodating_ manners, he will have a\r\n  chance of being introduced to the first company, and three card\r\n  parties every Sunday evening. One who knows a few college jokes, or\r\n  who has been Chaplain to the Whip Club, will be preferred. He will\r\n  have no occasion to administer Baptism, &c. &c. there being an old\r\n  gentleman employed, who, on account of extreme distress, has agreed,\r\n  for ten pounds per annum, to preach in the afternoon, and do all the\r\n  under work.\r\n\r\n  Letters must be addressed to James Speculate, Esq., Surveyor’s Office,\r\n  New Square, Mary-le-Bone.\r\n\r\nApropos of the foregoing, “The Goodfellow’s Calendar,” a handbook of\r\nhumorous anecdote and criticism for nearly every day in the year--some\r\nstray leaves of which have found their way into our possession--gives\r\nsome account of a parson who, it says, would have been eminently fitted\r\nfor the situation. “The Rev. R. C. Maturin, Curate of St. Peter’s,\r\nDublin, and author of one of the most immoral and trumpery tragedies,\r\n‘Bertram,’ that ever disgraced the stage, or gratified the low taste of\r\nan acting manager, died October 30th 1824. This exemplary pillar of the\r\nEstablished Church was exceedingly vain, both of his person and\r\naccomplishments, and as his income would not allow him to attract\r\nattention by the splendour of his dress and manners, he seldom failed to\r\ndo so by their singularity. Mr Maturin was tall, slender, but well\r\nproportioned, and on the whole a good figure, which he took care to\r\ndisplay in a well-made black coat tightly buttoned, and some odd\r\nlight-coloured stocking-web pantaloons, surmounted, in winter, by a coat\r\nof prodigious dimensions, gracefully thrown on, so as not to obscure the\r\nsymmetry it affected to protect. The Curate of St. Peters sang and\r\ndanced, and prided himself on performing the movements and evolutions of\r\nthe quadrille, certainly equal to any other divine of the Established\r\nChurch, if not to any private lay gentleman of the three kingdoms. It\r\noften happened, too, that Mr. Maturin, either laboured under an attack\r\nof gout or met with some accident, which compelled the use of a slipper\r\nor bandage on one foot or one leg; and by an unaccountable congruity of\r\nmischances he was uniformly compelled on these occasions to appear in\r\nthe public thoroughfares of Dublin, where the melancholy spectacle of a\r\nbeautiful limb in pain never failed to excite the sighs and sympathies\r\nof all the interesting persons who passed, as well as to prompt their\r\ncuriosity to make audible remarks or inquiries respecting the\r\npossessor.” We are much afraid that the vanity of Mr Maturin was not\r\nwonderfully peculiar, and with due allowance for those differences in\r\nour styles of dress and living which have been made in fifty years, it\r\nwould not be difficult to find ministers of the gospel who would prove\r\nstrong rivals to the curate of St Peter’s.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 the _New Times_ presented the public with the original of that\r\nsingular advertisement which has been so often quoted as an Irish bull,\r\nbut which would appear to be home-bred: “Wanted by a Surgeon residing at\r\nGuildford, two apprentices, who will be treated as one of the family.”\r\nThe Hibernian companion to this would most fitly be the Dublin editor’s\r\nstatement, in reference to a newly-invented laundry machine, that by its\r\nuse every man would probably become his own washerwoman. From\r\nwasherwomen to general servants is but a step, and so from the _Times_\r\nof five-and-twenty years back we extract a model specimen, supposed to\r\nemanate from that rarest of _raræ aves_, a pattern domestic:--\r\n\r\n  DO YOU WANT A SERVANT? Necessity prompts the question. The advertiser\r\n  OFFERS his SERVICES to any lady or gentleman, company, or others, in\r\n  want of a truly faithful, confidential servant in any capacity not\r\n  menial, where a practical knowledge of human nature in various parts\r\n  of the world would be available. Could undertake any affair of small\r\n  or great importance, where talent, inviolable secrecy, or good address\r\n  would be necessary. Has moved in the best and worst societies without\r\n  being contaminated by either; has never been a servant, begs to\r\n  recommend himself as one who knows his place; is moral, temperate,\r\n  middle-aged; no objection to any part of the world. Could advise any\r\n  capitalist wishing to increase his income and have the control of his\r\n  own money. Could act as secretary or valet to any lady or gentleman.\r\n  Can give advice or hold his tongue, sing, dance, play, fence, box,\r\n  preach a sermon, tell a story, be grave or gay, ridiculous or sublime,\r\n  or do anything from the curling of a peruke to the storming of a\r\n  citadel--but never to excel his master. Address ----.\r\n\r\nDiffering considerably, and yet much in the same line, is the following,\r\nwhich is amusing from the amount of confidence the writer possesses in\r\nhis own powers, and the small value he sets upon the attainments of\r\nthose who possess that most valuable qualification of all--property. The\r\noffer never to be better than his patron is a condescension indeed from\r\nsuch a paragon:--\r\n\r\n  TO INDEPENDENT GENTLEMEN.--Wanted by a respectable, modest young man,\r\n  who can produce a cubic yard of testimonials, a living without a\r\n  master--that is, he wishes to become a companion to some gentleman,\r\n  and be his factotum. He can ride, shoot, sing, fish (but never better\r\n  than his patron without he is wanted), keep accounts, see that\r\n  servants do their duty, do twenty other things, equally necessary in\r\n  this life, and make it his whole duty to please and be pleased. Any\r\n  one seriously wishing such a person, may address, post paid to Z., to\r\n  be left at ----.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements from the other side--from employers--are also noticeable\r\nnow and again, as this will show:--\r\n\r\n  BOARD AND RESIDENCE FOR WORK.--An old literary gentleman invites two\r\n  widow ladies, about forty, to assist him in doing without servants,\r\n  except a charwoman once a week. One lady must undertake entrées,\r\n  soups, and jellies. Both must be strong and healthy, so that the work\r\n  may be rather pleasant than irksome; two-thirds of it being for their\r\n  own comfort, as no company is ever kept. A private sitting-room.\r\n  Laundry free. All dining together at seven o’clock. References of\r\n  mercantile exactness required.--Address A. B., ---- stating age and\r\n  full particulars of antecedent position, &c.\r\n\r\nThis old literary gentleman was wise in his generation, as his offer,\r\nthough very plausible, meant nothing less than obtaining two servants\r\nwithout wages, and society as well. Possibly, however, the fact of the\r\nladies being widows was supposed, upon the principle of Tony Weller, to\r\ncompensate for shortcomings in the way of salary. Other applications for\r\na superior class of servants deserve attention, the following modest\r\noffer for a governess being a case in point:--\r\n\r\n  WANTED, in a gentleman’s family, a young lady, as NURSERY GOVERNESS,\r\n  to instruct two young ladies in French, music, and singing, with the\r\n  usual branches of education, and to take the entire charge of their\r\n  wardrobe. She must be of a social disposition and fond of children,\r\n  and have the manners of a gentlewoman, as she will be treated as one\r\n  of the family. Salary twelve guineas per annum. Address ----.\r\n\r\nAll for the small price of twelve guineas per annum, about half what a\r\ndecent housemaid expects, and with less than half the liberty of a\r\nscullion. Yet this advertisement appeared in the _Times_, and is but the\r\nrepresentative of others of the same kind, not one of which is supposed\r\nto betray meanness or poverty of spirit on the part of its originator.\r\nFor twelve guineas a year, the poverty-stricken orphan or daughter of\r\nsome once rich speculator is to teach French, music, singing, writing,\r\narithmetic, geography, history, and other of the “usual branches of\r\neducation,” to two young ladies, who it is only fair to expect would be\r\nmuch more like the brassfounder’s daughter who objected to Ruth Pinch\r\nthan similar to the charge of Becky Sharp when she occupied a\r\ngoverness’s position. In addition to the drudgery of teaching, there is\r\nthe charge of the young ladies’ wardrobe, which means an occupation of\r\nitself; and then comes--oh, worst of all!--the social disposition, by\r\nwhich is undoubtedly meant a capacity for doing whatever any other\r\nmember of the family may object to do--for being the drudge of the\r\ndrawing-room when the little tyrants of the nursery are abed and asleep.\r\nBy the manners of a gentlewoman is understood a capacity for receiving\r\nstudied insult without resentment, and by treatment as one of the family\r\nsuch care and comfort as would cause the cook to take her instant\r\ndeparture. And all this for twelve guineas per annum! This may be called\r\nan overdrawn picture, but that is what is said of most self-evident\r\nfacts. And what father worthy of the name would die easily if he thought\r\nthat his tenderly-nurtured daughters were likely to be grateful for the\r\nprotection and the salary offered in the foregoing specimen\r\nadvertisement? Yet many a young girl has suddenly found herself divested\r\nof every luxury, and subject to the tender mercies of those who regard a\r\nnursery governess as “one of the family.” There is an old story in\r\nreference to the selection of governesses which is worth repeating here.\r\nA lady wrote to her son requesting him to find a teacher for his\r\nsisters, and enumerating a long list of qualifications, somewhat similar\r\nto those generally expected in a pretentious family. The son seems to\r\nhave been wiser than his mother, for he replied stating that he had\r\nstudied the requirements, and that when he found a young lady possessed\r\nof them all, he should endeavour to engage her, not as a governess for\r\nhis sisters, but as a wife for himself. Marriage alters women, however,\r\nas the subjoined notice from an Irish paper proves to the most\r\nsceptical:--\r\n\r\n  RUN AWAY FROM PATRICK M‘DALLAGH.--Whereas my wife Mrs Bridget\r\n  M‘Dallagh, is again walked away with herself, and left me with her\r\n  four small children, and her poor old blind mother, and nobody else to\r\n  look after house and home, and, I hear, has taken up with Tim Guigan,\r\n  the lame fiddler--the same that was put in the stocks last Easter for\r\n  stealing Barday Doody’s gamecock.--This is to give notice, that I will\r\n  not pay for bite or sup on her or his account to man or mortal, and\r\n  that she had better never show the mark of her ten toes near my home\r\n  again.\r\n\r\n  PATRICK M‘DALLAGH.\r\n\r\n  N.B. Tim had better keep out of my sight.\r\n\r\nMrs Bridget seems to have been in the habit of straying from the path of\r\nvirtue and her husband’s home, which, if we are to believe Irish poets\r\nand orators, must have been very exceptional behaviour in the land of\r\n“virtue and Erin.” As if to provide against similar emergency, a\r\nParisian puts forth an advertisement, the translation of which runs\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n  A gentleman in his twenty-sixth year, tired of the dissipation of the\r\n  great world, is forming a comfortable establishment in one of the\r\n  least frequented quarters of the city. His domestics are a coachman,\r\n  cook, three footmen and a chambermaid. He is in search of a young girl\r\n  of good family to improve this honourable situation: she must be well\r\n  educated, accomplished, and of an agreeable figure, and will be\r\n  entertained in the quality of _demoiselle de compagnie_. She shall\r\n  receive the utmost attention from the household, and be as well served\r\n  in every respect as, or even better than, if she were its mistress.\r\n\r\nAs just now there is constant change of opinion as to what forms the\r\nbest pavement for the streets with the greatest traffic, as the stones\r\nwhich seemed to be agreed on for ever are every day becoming more and\r\nmore disliked, and as the main difference now is which is likely to\r\nprove the more profitable change, asphalt or wood, the following, from\r\nthe _Times_ of 1851, may not be uninteresting:--\r\n\r\n  WOOD PAVEMENT.--All poor and distressed cabriolet proprietors and\r\n  others, wheresoever dispersed, are particularly requested to FORWARD\r\n  to us immediately PROVED ACCOUNTS in writing of all ACCIDENTS to and\r\n  DEATHS of HORSES, and Personal and other Casualties, in order that the\r\n  several parishes may respectfully, in the first place be\r\n  extra-judicially called on to repay all damages (at our offices),\r\n  within one calendar month of our respective applications, or otherwise\r\n  have proceedings taken against them respectively in the County Courts,\r\n  or under superior jurisdictions, and be so judicially and speedily\r\n  made to pay on account of entering into ex-parte contracts rendering\r\n  life and limb and travelling generally unsafe and dangerous in the\r\n  extreme, and so continuing the bad state of the wood pavement; for no\r\n  contracts can be lawful and right unless impliedly perused and\r\n  approved of on behalf of the public generally.\r\n\r\n  Cole and Scott, Solicitors, 12 Furnival’s Inn and Notting Hill.\r\n\r\nIf the “London stones” become things of the past, they and their\r\nadvocates will be revenged by the undoubted fact that whatever follows\r\nthem will, after the novelty has worn off, be just as much abused as its\r\npredecessor, and most likely changed much more speedily. Deserving of\r\nattention, too, though on a totally different matter, is the following.\r\nIt seems hard to believe that a London tradesman could believe he was\r\nlikely to get his note back by informing a man what he must have already\r\nknown; but such is the case. This must be what is known as “throwing\r\ngood money after bad:”--\r\n\r\n  CORAL NECKLACE.--The gentleman who purchased a coral necklace in\r\n  Bishopsgate-street, on Monday last received in change for a £20 note a\r\n  FIVE-POUND NOTE too much. He is requested to RETURN it.\r\n\r\nVulgar people would say that the buyer of the coral necklace changed his\r\nname to Walker after this. But changes of name are not legal unless duly\r\nadvertised. Speaking of advertising changes of name, a title by which\r\nthose lodging-house pests, bugs, are now often known, that of Norfolk\r\nHowards, is derived from an advertisement in which one Ephraim Bug\r\navowed his intention of being for the future known as Norfolk Howard. We\r\nhave never seen this announcement, but have noticed many others, the\r\nappended being a specimen, though of a much less sensational kind than\r\nthat we have just referred to:--\r\n\r\n  NOTICE.--I, the undersigned THOMAS HUGHES FORDE DAVIES, of Abercery,\r\n  in the county of Cardigan, Esq., do hereby Give Notice, that I shall,\r\n  on and after the 1st day of October, 1873, ASSUME the names THOMAS\r\n  HUGHES FORDE HUGHES, instead of the names of Thomas Hughes Forde\r\n  Davies, by which last-mentioned names I have hitherto been known and\r\n  described. And I do hereby request and direct all persons whomsoever\r\n  to address and describe me as Thomas Hughes Forde Hughes, and not\r\n  otherwise. And I further Give Notice, that I have executed the\r\n  necessary Deed Poll in that behalf, and cause the same to be enrolled\r\n  in her Majesty’s High Court of Chancery.--Dated this 29th day of\r\n  September, 1873.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS HUGHES FORDE DAVIES.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal in a name in the present day, and there are some\r\nnames which for obvious reasons do not smell as sweet as roses, and\r\ntherefore require changing. This observation does not, of course, refer\r\nto the change from Davies to Hughes, of which we know absolutely\r\nnothing, except that it appeared in the _Standard_ of October 1873. As\r\nthere seems little to choose between the two names, it is fair to assume\r\nthat family reasons or property qualifications led to the alteration. In\r\nthe interest of those good people who sincerely believe in appearances,\r\nwe select our next example from the columns of the _Times_. Those, also,\r\nwho are in the habit of asking what good there is in a University\r\neducation will do well to ponder over these lines:--\r\n\r\n  ARTICLED ASSISTANT.--If the GENTLEMAN who called at Messrs ---- and\r\n  ---- 29, Poultry, on Thursday the 20th February in answer to an\r\n  advertisement in that day’s _Times_ for “An Articled Assistant” will\r\n  CALL again at the office to which he was referred, and where he stated\r\n  that he was a Cambridge man &c., no doubt satisfactory arrangements\r\n  can be made, as appearance is the chief object.\r\n\r\nAppearance is indeed the chief object of attention at the present day,\r\nand its influence goes much farther than people imagine, even at the\r\nvery time they are subscribing to it. Not alone does it affect the\r\npositions of the drapers’ young man, the shop-walker, and the modern\r\n_jeune premier_, the latter of whom may be an idiot so long as he is\r\nyoung, tall, slim, and good-looking, but it materially influences a\r\nhigher class of society. Day after day we see men credited, by means of\r\nlying heads and faces, with the qualifications and abilities they do not\r\npossess; and, on the other hand, we as frequently find the mildest and\r\nmost benevolent of gentlemen regarded as desperate characters or\r\nhard-fisted old curmudgeons. No one will nowadays believe that a man who\r\ndoes not look very clever or very foolish can do anything in literature\r\nor the arts above the common run; and the most frequent exclamation to\r\nbe heard after a real celebrity has been seen is one of disappointment,\r\nso little will he bear comparison with the ideal. Appearances were never\r\nmore deceptive, and never more believed in, than they are now.\r\n\r\nStories of advertising tombstones, some true, some apocryphal, are\r\nplentiful, and the best of those in which reliance can be placed is that\r\nabout the Parisian grocer. It is well known that at the Père la Chaise\r\nCemetery, near Paris, there stands, or stood, in a conspicuous position,\r\na splendid monument to Pierre Cabochard, grocer, with a pathetic\r\ninscription, which closes thus:--\r\n\r\n  His inconsolable widow\r\n  dedicates this monument to his memory\r\n  and continues the same business at the\r\n  old stand, 187, Rue Mouffetard.\r\n\r\nA gentleman who had noticed the inscription was led by curiosity to call\r\nat the address indicated. Having expressed his desire to see the widow\r\nCabochard, he was immediately ushered into the presence of a\r\nfashionably-dressed and full-bearded man, who asked him what was the\r\nobject of his visit. “I come to see the widow Cabochard.” “Well, sir,\r\nhere she is.” “I beg your pardon, but I wish to see the lady in person.”\r\n“Sir, I am the widow Cabochard.” “I don’t exactly understand you. I\r\nallude to the relict of the late Pierre Cabochard, whose monument I saw\r\nyesterday at the Père la Chaise.” “I see, I see,” was the smiling\r\nrejoinder. “Allow me to inform you that Pierre Cabochard is a myth, and\r\ntherefore never had a wife. The tomb you admired cost me a good deal of\r\nmoney, and, although no one is buried there, it proves a first-rate\r\nadvertisement, and I have had no cause to regret the expense. Now, sir,\r\nwhat can I sell you in the way of groceries?” The art of mingling\r\nmourning and money-making was still better illustrated in the following\r\nnotice of a death in a Spanish paper:--\r\n\r\n  This morning our Saviour summoned away the jeweller, Siebald Illmaga,\r\n  from his shop to another and a better world. The undersigned, his\r\n  widow, will weep upon his tomb, as will also his two daughters, Hilda\r\n  and Emma; the former of whom is married, and the latter is open to an\r\n  offer. The funeral will take place to-morrow.--His disconsolate widow,\r\n  Veronique Illmaga. P. S. This bereavement will not interrupt our\r\n  employment which will be carried on as usual, only our place of\r\n  business will be removed from No. 3, Tessi de Teinturiers to No. 4,\r\n  Rue de Missionaire, as our grasping landlord has raised our rent.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements which now and again appear in the _Times_ from people who\r\nseek employment or money are both curious and eccentric, and in none of\r\nthem do the writers suffer at all from bashfulness or modest ideas of\r\ntheir own qualifications. In this, which is an appeal for a situation,\r\nthe constructor describes himself as\r\n\r\n  A CHARACTER.--The noblemen and gentlemen of England are respectfully\r\n  informed that the advertiser is a self-taught man--a “genius.” He has\r\n  travelled (chiefly on foot) through the United Kingdom of Great\r\n  Britain and Ireland, in Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium,\r\n  France, and Italy. He has conducted a popular periodical, written a\r\n  work of fiction in three vols., published a system of theology,\r\n  composed a drama, studied Hamlet, been a political lecturer, a\r\n  preacher, a village schoolmaster, a pawnbroker, a general shopkeeper;\r\n  has been acquainted with more than one founder of a sect, and is now\r\n  (he thanks Providence) in good health, spirits, and character, out of\r\n  debt, and living in charity with all mankind. During the remainder of\r\n  his life he thinks he would feel quite at home as secretary,\r\n  amanuensis, or companion to any nobleman or gentleman who will engage\r\n  a once erratic but now sedate being, whose chief delight consists in\r\n  seeing and making those around him cheerful and happy. Address A. Z.,\r\n  at Mr. ----’s, ---- Street, Regent’s Park.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, when people break out in this style they are much more in\r\nwant of the money than the work, although they cloak their actual\r\ndesires under the guise of applications for situations or employment.\r\nThere are not a few, however, who come boldly to the point, as the\r\nfollowing, also from the _Times_, shows:--\r\n\r\n  A MAN OF RANK, holding a distinguished public office, moving in the\r\n  highest society, and with brilliant prospects--has been suddenly\r\n  called upon to pay some thousands of pounds, owing to the default of a\r\n  friend for whom he had become guarantee. As his present means are\r\n  unable to meet this demand, and he can offer no adequate security for\r\n  a loan, the consequence must be ruin to himself and his family,\r\n  unless some individual of wealth and munificence will step forward to\r\n  avert this calamity, by applying £4000 to his rescue. For this he\r\n  frankly avows that he can, in present circumstances, offer no other\r\n  return than his gratitude. A personal interview, however painful, will\r\n  be readily granted, in the confidence that the generosity of his\r\n  benefactor will be the best guarantee for his delicate observance of\r\n  secrecy. He hopes his distressing condition will protect him from the\r\n  prying of heartless curiosity, and to prevent the approaches of\r\n  money-holders, he begs to repeat that he can give no security. Address\r\n  to “Anxious,” General Post Office, London.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who are curious about men of rank, and in the\r\ninterests of those who may like to speculate as to who this holder of a\r\ndistinguished public office may have been, we will state that the\r\nadvertisement appeared just thirty years ago. There were then, and have\r\nbeen since, many men in office who wanted four thousand pounds; in fact\r\nit would be a hard matter to find a man anywhere to whom that\r\namount--or, for the matter of that, a good bit less--would not be\r\nagreeable. That these advertisements were not altogether fruitless,\r\nthis, from the _Times_ of February 1851, would seem to show:--\r\n\r\n  TRURO.--The generous friend who transmitted from this place under\r\n  cover to the Secretary, G.P.O. an ENVELOPE containing a SUM of MONEY\r\n  is gratefully informed that the individual for whom it was intended\r\n  was relieved by it to an extent of which he can form no conception,\r\n  and is earnestly entreated COMMUNICATE, if not his name, at least an\r\n  address to which a letter may be sent.\r\n\r\n  W. H.\r\n\r\nMen reduced in circumstances seem to have less and less chance as the\r\nworld gets older. There would not be much good got out of an\r\nadvertisement for money nowadays, whatever the original position of\r\nadvertiser, unless he could promise something in return. His promise\r\nmight be quite impossible of performance, but still it would be\r\nsomething; and if we are to judge by most of the swindling\r\nadvertisements which have succeeded in taking in thousands of people,\r\nthe more improbable the undertaking the more probable the success. Here\r\nis another man of high rank, of later date, who only asks for\r\nemployment. A good pinch of salt must, we think, be taken with the\r\nconcluding sentence of the application:--\r\n\r\n  IT WOULD BE A NOBLE ACT OF HUMANITY if any generous and kind-hearted\r\n  individual would procure or grant EMPLOYMENT to a suffering\r\n  individual, in whose behalf this appeal is made. He is of high rank,\r\n  education, and manners, and in every point of view fit to fill any\r\n  situation. He is without influential friends, and from complicated\r\n  frauds and misfortunes, is unable to continue the education of eight\r\n  lovely children. He seeks nothing for himself, except to be so placed,\r\n  giving to the hands of his kind benefactor all he receives for his\r\n  children’s present and future support. This will save him from a\r\n  broken heart. Any situation that will enable him to effect this object\r\n  will be received with heartfelt gratitude, and filled with honour,\r\n  assiduity, and fidelity. Most respectable reference, &c. N.B. No\r\n  pecuniary assistance can be received. Address ----.\r\n\r\nA man of “high rank, education, and manners,” without influential\r\nfriends, is certainly an anomaly in this country; and the “eight lovely\r\nchildren” forcibly remind us of the large families which begging-letter\r\nimpostors and cadgers generally have constantly at home, hungering not\r\nso much for education as for bread and meat. The mention of high birth\r\nreminds us of the many advertisements which have in the course of years\r\nappeared from people who, not satisfied with being rich, seek to be\r\nfashionable, and who offer free quarters and other advantages to any one\r\npossessed of the _entrée_ to Society, and yet not over-gifted with the\r\nmore solid blessings of this world. Of course these generally appear in\r\nthe most fashionable papers, and the specimen which follows is taken\r\nfrom the _Morning Post_ of half-a-dozen years ago. With the exception\r\nthat it mentions foreign towns, it is almost identical with others which\r\nhave appeared in reference to our own most exclusive circles:--\r\n\r\n  SEASONS at SPA and BRUSSELS.--A Lady and Gentleman, well connected,\r\n  offer to RECEIVE as their GUEST, free of all expense, a lady or a\r\n  gentleman of family, who, in sole return for the freedom of home,\r\n  could give the entrée into Belgian society. Spa in the summer,\r\n  Brussels in the winter. A small establishment. A good cook. The\r\n  highest references.--Address P. R., Poste Restante, Brussels.\r\n\r\nSuch notices as this go far to prove the truth of the saying that there\r\nare blessings beyond price, that is, of course, always supposing the\r\nadvertisements were unsuccessful. We shall never in future meet any loud\r\nvulgar person in Society--provided we are ever admitted within the\r\nsacred portal--without suspecting him of having crawled in by means of\r\nbribery. Yet our suspicions may alight upon the very leaders of _ton_;\r\nfor, so far, the most vulgar men we ever met--among gentlemen--were a\r\nhorse-racing earl and a coach-driving viscount, and they could have been\r\nbacked against any four men in that army, the peculiarities of which,\r\nwhile in the Low Countries, will be found recorded in “Tristram Shandy.”\r\nAmong other advertisements in the columns of the leading journal, worthy\r\nof notice in this chapter, are those singular effusions which appear at\r\nintervals, especially during any period of political effervescence, and\r\nwhich consist of mad schemes, the offspring of enthusiastic patriots and\r\nheadlong regenerators of the nation. The following is a fair specimen of\r\nthese:--\r\n\r\n  TO THE MINISTERS OF STATE, NOBILITY, AND COMMUNITY AT LARGE.--A Remedy\r\n  for the distresses of England. Every considerate person admits the\r\n  present condition of society to be perfectly anomalous. A remedy has\r\n  at length been discovered--a remedy which would effectually arrest the\r\n  progress of pauperism, confer incalculable benefits upon the\r\n  industrial community, and diffuse joy and gladness throughout the\r\n  length and breadth of the land, making England (without exaggeration)\r\n  the envy of surrounding nations, and the admiration of the world. The\r\n  plan possesses the peculiar merit of being practicable, and easy of\r\n  application, without in the slightest degree infringing the rights of\r\n  property as by law established, or in any way disturbing the present\r\n  relations of society. The advertiser will communicate his discovery\r\n  either to the ministers of state, nobility, or those who may take an\r\n  interest in the wellbeing of society, on condition of his receiving\r\n  (if his plans are approved, and made available for the purposes\r\n  contemplated) £100,000. “If the nation be saved, it is not to be saved\r\n  by the ordinary operations of statesmanship.”--Lord Ashley. Address\r\n  ----.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, the mysterious “personal” advertisements which years\r\nago were so frequent and so extraordinary--but which now are rarely\r\nnoticeable except when devoted to the purposes of puffing tradesmen, or\r\nwhen they are more than ordinarily stupid--must naturally receive\r\nattention. Now and again a strange announcement attracts a little\r\ncuriosity in the present day; but for good specimens of the dark and\r\nmysterious advertisement we must go back twenty years, and by so doing\r\nwe shall be enabled at the same time to give a very good reason why\r\npeople who correspond through the public papers in cipher or otherwise\r\nare careful not to attract particular attention. This reason will\r\nexhibit itself by means of two cryptographic specimens selected, which\r\nappeared in the _Times_, and were the means of showing that writers of\r\nsecret signs and passwords must be clever indeed if they would evade the\r\nlynx eyes of those who are ever ready for a little mild excitement, and\r\nwhose hobby it is to solve riddles and discover puzzles. Certainly there\r\nmust be more pleasure in finding out the meaning of a secret “personal”\r\nthan in answering the double acrostic charades with which the weekly\r\npapers swarm, and which must occupy the attention of thousands, if the\r\nquantities of correct and erroneous replies that are received at the\r\nvarious offices may be accepted as evidence. In the early part of 1853 a\r\nmad-looking advertisement appeared in the _Times_, which ran thus:--\r\n\r\n  CENERENTOLA.--N bnxm yt ywd nk dtz hfs wjfi ymnx fsi fr rtxy fscntzx\r\n  yt mjfw ymf esi bmjs dtz wjyzws, f imtb qtsldtz wjrfns, mjwj It bwnyf\r\n  f kjb qnsjx jfwqnsl uqjfxj: N mfaj gjjs ajwd kfw kwtr mfund xnshy dtz\r\n  bjsy fbfd.\r\n\r\nWhich being interpreted, reads: “Cenerentola, I wish to try if you can\r\nread this, and am most anxious to hear the end, when you return, and how\r\nlong you remain here. Do write a few lines, darling, please. I have been\r\nvery far from happy since you went away.” This appeared in February 2,\r\nand some difficulty appears to be in the way, for it is not till the\r\n11th that we find another, which is evidently not in reply, and equally\r\nevidently not satisfactory. It says:--\r\n\r\n  CENERENTOLA.--Zsynq rd mjfwy nx xnhp mfaj ywnji yt kwfrj fs\r\n  jcugfifynts kwt dtz gzy hfssty. Xnqjshj nx xfs jxy nk ymf ywzj hfzxj\r\n  nx sty xzx jhyji; nk ny nx fgg xytwnjx bngg gj xnkyji yt ymj gtyytr.\r\n  It dtz wjrjrgjw tzw htzxns’x knwxy uwtutxnynts: ymnsp tk ny.\r\n\r\nAs this system simply consisted in commencing the alphabet with the\r\nletter _f_ and continuing in regular sequence, the explanation of the\r\nlast specimen is almost obvious; but so that there should be no\r\ndifficulty or doubt about it, and so that the intriguers should know\r\nthey were discovered, some literary lockpicker inserted on the 15th, in\r\nthe usual personal column of the _Times_, a full translation, correcting\r\nall errors of the printer, and concluding with a notice in the secret\r\nlanguage, which must have frightened its originators. The explanatory\r\nadvertisement runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  CENERENTOLA, until my heart is sick have I tried to frame an\r\n  explanation for you, but cannot. Silence is safest, if the true cause\r\n  is not suspected: if it is all stories will be sifted to the bottom.\r\n  Do you remember our cousin’s first proposition? Think of it.--N pstb\r\n  Dtz.\r\n\r\nThe cryptogram at the end is a warning, for, subjected to the test, we\r\nfind it is neither more nor less than “I know you.” This seems to have\r\neffectually silenced the originals; but the marplots were probably still\r\nat work, for on the 19th of February another notification appears, this\r\ntime in plain English, and running thus:--\r\n\r\n  CENERENTOLA, what nonsense! Your cousin’s proposition is absurd. I\r\n  have given an explanation--the true one--which has perfectly satisfied\r\n  both parties--a thing which silence never could have effected. So no\r\n  more such absurdity.\r\n\r\nHow miserably small the inventor of this cipher must have felt, and how\r\nridiculous those most interested must have appeared to each other, we\r\nleave to the imaginations of those readers who have suddenly been\r\nstopped in any grand flight to find themselves as idiotic as they had\r\nbefore considered themselves ingenious. Doubtless the Cenerentolans will\r\nnot want for sympathisers even amongst those who affect most to ridicule\r\nthem. Much about the same time as the instance we have given, and while\r\nthe rage for secret advertising was in its meridian, one of the most\r\nremarkable samples of the kind appeared--remarkable as much for its want\r\nof reason as for anything else. On February 20, 1852, we are told by the\r\n_Quarterly_, there appeared in the _Times_ the following mysterious\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n  TIG tjohw it tig jfhiirvola og tig psgvw.\r\n  F. D. N.\r\n\r\nThis was a little above the ordinary hand, and many attempts at\r\ndeciphering it failed. At last the following explanation was published\r\nin the _Quarterly_. If we take the first word of the sentence, Tig, and\r\nplace under its second letter, i, the one which alphabetically precedes\r\nit, and treat the next letters in a similar manner, we shall have the\r\nfollowing combination:--\r\n\r\n  T i g\r\n    h f\r\n      e\r\n\r\nReading the first letters obliquely, we have the article “The;” if we\r\ntreat the second word in the same manner, the following will be the\r\nresult:--\r\n\r\n  T j o h w\r\n    i n g v\r\n      m f u\r\n        e t\r\n          s\r\n\r\nwhich read in the same slanting way produces the word _Times_. So far\r\nour authority is correct, and here we leave him. The following\r\nparticiple and article are of course evident, and then comes the\r\nprincipal word of the sentence, which the transcriber makes to be\r\nJefferies, which it is doubtless intended to be; but in his hurry the\r\ninventor or solver has made a mistake, as is shown upon an attempt at\r\nthe same conclusion:--\r\n\r\n  J f h i i r v o l a\r\n    e g h h q u n k z\r\n      f g g p t m j y\r\n        f f o s l i x\r\n          e n r k h w\r\n            m q j g v\r\n              p i f u\r\n                h e t\r\n                  d s\r\n                    r\r\n\r\nThis gives the word as Jeffemphdr, an expression which, if it can be\r\nexpressed at all, is very dissimilar from that we expected, after being\r\ntold that the sentence read--\r\n\r\n  The Times is the Jefferies of the press.\r\n\r\nWe have taken this trouble and used this space in the endeavour to see\r\nif the letters would make “Jefferies,” because we have always had a\r\nsuspicion that the first explainer was also the originator. The\r\nadvertisement, without being rendered into English, could not have\r\ngratified the malice or satisfied the spite of its writer; and as, if\r\nany one else had discovered the key and made the attempt, he would have\r\nremarked the error, it is but fair to assume that “F. D. N.,” whoever\r\nelse he may have been, was the individual whom a writer in the\r\n_Quarterly Review_, a couple of years or so afterwards, described as the\r\nfriend who “was curious and intelligent enough to extract the plain\r\nEnglish out of it,” and whose design we commenced with. Was he an author\r\nwho had been slated in the _Times_? However, as the advertiser evidently\r\nmeant Jeffreys, however he may have fancied to spell it, the explanation\r\nmay be taken as all right.[35] This and the preceding advertisement\r\nmust have set people thinking that it was hardly safe to trust to\r\nsecrets in the papers, no matter how carefully disguised; but the\r\ncrowning blow to cryptographic communication was given by means of the\r\n“Flo” intrigue, which created some little sensation, and was the cause\r\nof a good deal of amusement at the close of the year 1853 and the\r\nbeginning of 1854. On November 29 of the first-named year the following\r\nwas first seen in the _Times_:--\r\n\r\n  FLO.--1821 82374 09 30 84541. 844532 18140650. 8 54584 2401 322650 526\r\n  08555 94400 021 12 30 84541 22 05114650. 726 85400 021.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to premise that the idea of the “Flo” system was to\r\nmake an alphabet with the nine numerals and the cipher, and the\r\ncorrespondents evidently prided themselves, poor innocents, on having\r\narranged the letters arbitrarily and not in regular order, and fixed the\r\ntell-tale capital I when standing alone at 8:--\r\n\r\n  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\r\n  y  u  o  i  e  a  d  k  h  f\r\n  s  t  n  m  r  l  q  g  w  p\r\n  x                    c  b\r\n                          v\r\n\r\nSo the communication read: “Flo, thou voice of my heart! Berlin,\r\nThursday. I leave next Monday, and shall press you to my heart on\r\nSaturday. God bless you.” How they communicated for the next month does\r\nnot appear, but judging by the quotation just given, it is to be\r\nsupposed personally, and that another separation occurred soon after,\r\nfor on December 21 there is this:--\r\n\r\n  FLO.--1821 82374 29 30 84541 8 53 02 522450. 8 3300 021 3244 1852\r\n  4844. 8 5227 51 0214 9371144 48440 23781. 8 0426 021 52 326352 08585\r\n  12 8459 42116 021 88354 505449 59144 632244. 31 8355 7449 021 8543 526\r\n  021 3101 95270 1851 31 5430 544 42126 021. 726 85400 021.\r\n\r\nWhich, errors included, reads: “Flo, thou voice of my heart, I am so\r\nlonely. I miss you more than ever. I look at your picture every night. I\r\nsend you an Indian shawl to wrap rou_t_d you while asleep after dinner.\r\nIt will keep you warm, and you must fancy that m_t_ arms are round you.\r\nGod bless you.” Two days afterwards the next appears, though the\r\ntranslation hardly gives a substantial reason for the repetition:--\r\n\r\n  FLO.--184 5501 850 84227 8 449451 31. 1821 82374 29 30 84541 8 53 02\r\n  522450. 8 3300 021 3244 1852 4844. 8 5227 51 0214 9371144 48140 23781.\r\n  8 0426 021 52 326352 08585 12 8459 42126 021 88354 505449 59144 63224\r\n  31 8355 7449 021 8543 526 021 3101 95270 1851 30 5430 544 42126 021.\r\n  726 85400 021. 828 8 62 5284 021.\r\n\r\nThis makes: “Flo, the last was wrong, I repeat it. Thou voice of my\r\nheart, I am so lonely. I miss you more than ever. I look at your picture\r\nev_u_ry night. I send you an Indian shawl to wrap round you while asleep\r\nafter dinn_r_. It will keep you warm, and you must fancy my arms are\r\nround you. God bless you. How I do love you!” It will be hard to\r\ndiscover, if the last was wrong, how this can be right, as for each\r\nerror he corrects he makes another. Then we go on to the new year, and\r\non January 2 recommence with the following:--\r\n\r\n  FLO.--30 282 5284 853 85990 57532 31 30 5374 5857327 9423 5 856 64453.\r\n  021 544 30 5334 12 7228 1851 18444 305 785274 29 044327 021 12 8454\r\n  9423 021 12 62 183270 12 422178. 8 08555 140 526 044 021 0222 84314 12\r\n  34 50 29142 50 021 752 726 85400 021 1821 82174 29 30 84541.\r\n\r\nDifficulties seem to have been removed by this time, for when the magic\r\nof the key has been tried upon it the advertisement just quoted says\r\nthis: “Flo, my own love, I am happy again; it is like awakening from a\r\nbad dream. You are, my li_m_e [? life], to know that there is a chance\r\nof seeing you, to hear from you, to do things to enough [there is an\r\nevident bungle here]. I shall try and see you soon. Write to me as often\r\nas you can. God bless you, thou vo_u_ce of my heart!” The wise men who\r\nhad been content to understand this so far, now thought it time that\r\nthese turtle-doves should know they were not so wise as they supposed,\r\nand that their cipher was being read regularly. So on January 6 the\r\n_Times_ contained the following:--\r\n\r\n  FLO.--1821 82374 29 39 84541. 828 8 62 5284 021. 828 544 021 08555 021\r\n  84 5536 19 1830 094 327. 8 752 044 021 8557327 8318 0214 6545327 8851\r\n  8 82156 7384 12 84 8318 021. 185270 924 0314 5501 541144 8 9454\r\n  2218327 811 0495 451322 9423 021 021 544 30 82456 30 5394 30 8294.\r\n  1821 3244 1852 5394 95448455 726 85400 021.\r\n\r\nAnd this when read must have caused some feeling of consternation, as it\r\nwas an evident burlesque of the real correspondent’s style: “Flo, thou\r\nvoice of my heart! How I do love you! How are you? Shall you be laid up\r\nthis spring? I can see you walking with your darling. What would I give\r\nto be with you! Thanks for your last letter. I fear nothing but\r\nseparation from you. You are my world, my life, my hope. Thou more than\r\nlife, farewell! God bless you!” The natural effect of this was to cause\r\nan alarm to be given, and so on the following day the following was\r\ninserted in the famous private column:--\r\n\r\n  FLO.--8 9454 6454401 214 739 844 30 6307284446. 84314 51 2274 12 0214\r\n  943426 “326352 08585.” 9. 2. 8177327853. 81770.\r\n\r\nWhich drops the curtain upon “Flo” and her lover, who is more than\r\nlikely not to have been her husband--and this without affecting the\r\nquestion as to her being married. It is translated in these words:\r\n“Flo.--I fear, dearest, our cipher is discovered. Write at once to your\r\nfriend, “Indian Shawl,” P. O., Buckingham, Bucks.” So much for secret\r\ncorrespondences, which are not often to be seen nowadays, though when\r\nany one is found foolish enough to confide in the press under these\r\ncircumstances, the comic papers almost invariably make capital out of\r\nthe communications, and give to their less acute readers full\r\ninformation. Here is one we fell across the other day in the\r\n_Telegraph_. We must admit to a decided ignorance as to what it means,\r\nbut perhaps the reader, profiting by the foregoing, will be able to\r\ndecipher it:--\r\n\r\n  KANGAROO revived by bones, though nearly choked by a piece of one\r\n  after swallowing five hard biscuits. Troubled. Four cat two six camel\r\n  five two one eight pig one boar in every way. Four nine leopard one\r\n  four elephant three four seven boar. Faithful until death.\r\n\r\nThis looks like an attempt to set the cryptographists on a wrong scent,\r\nand probably means nothing. If it really is a genuine communication, its\r\nscope must be extremely limited. Many of the mysterious advertisements\r\nwhich appear in the usual style are very noticeable, though of late the\r\nart has fallen a prey to the vendors of quack medicines and cheap books,\r\nand the managers of some theatres and music-halls. What has been\r\ncharacterised, and with every probability of truth, as the most ghastly\r\nadvertisement that ever appeared in a public journal is the following,\r\nwhich is taken from the _Times_ of the year 1845. It certainly is a most\r\nfrightful paragraph:--\r\n\r\n  TO THE PARTY WHO POSTS HIS LETTERS IN PRINCE’S STREET, LEICESTER\r\n  SQUARE.--Your family is now in a state of excitement unbearable. Your\r\n  attention is called to an advertisement in Wednesday’s Morning\r\n  Advertiser, headed “A body found drowned at Deptford.” After your\r\n  avowal to your friend as to what you might do, he has been to see the\r\n  decomposed remains, accompanied by others. The features are gone; but\r\n  there are marks on the arm; so that unless they hear from you to-day,\r\n  it will satisfy them that the remains are those of their misguided\r\n  relative, and steps will be directly taken to place them in the family\r\n  vault, as they cannot bear the idea of a pauper’s funeral.\r\n\r\nThe most horrible subject has, however, a ludicrous side, and the idea\r\nof the decomposed remains objecting to parochial interference is as\r\ndreadfully funny as the matter generally is dreadfully shocking. In\r\nanother notice, five years later, there is, as it were, a plaintive\r\nmoan, the cry of a weak and distressed woman, who has no “strong mind”\r\nto enable her to bear up against infidelity and loss. Listen to it:--\r\n\r\n  THE one-winged Dove must die unless the Crane returns to be a shield\r\n  against her enemies.\r\n\r\nFar different is the next, which is a couple of years later, and which\r\ndisplays as much strength of purpose and self-dependence as its\r\nforerunner betrays weakness:--\r\n\r\n  IT is enough; one man alone upon earth have I found noble. Away from\r\n  me for ever! Cold heart and mean spirit, you have lost what\r\n  millions--empires--could not have bought, but which a single word\r\n  truthfully and nobly spoken might have made your own to all eternity.\r\n  Yet are you forgiven: depart in peace: I rest in my Redeemer.\r\n\r\nThe reader can imagine the flashing eyes and indignant face of a proud\r\nand wronged woman, as this is read; and it might well be taken as the\r\ntext for a whole volume of a modern novel. The next which we select is\r\nstill from the _Times_, and appeared several days in succession in\r\nFebruary 1853. It forms a good companion to that which precedes it:\r\n\r\n  TO M. L. L.--M. L. L., you have chosen your own lot: may it be a happy\r\n  one! and if it be so I would not have you think of the desolate heart\r\n  you leave behind; but oh! my child, if sorrow should ever overtake\r\n  you, if you should find, when too late, that you have been leaning on\r\n  a broken reed; then, my Maria, come back to her whose heart has ever\r\n  cherished you; she will always be ready to receive you.\r\n\r\nMaybe M. L. L. has proved herself devoid of gratitude, and left a kind\r\nhome to follow the fortunes of some adventurer. But the good heart of\r\nthe advertiser does not turn sour, nor does she give vent to repining;\r\nand so even in advertisements do we see the finest as well as the worst\r\nsides of human nature. In the same paper that contained the address just\r\ngiven we stumbled across one of the most laconic notices ever seen. It\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n  IF H. R. will Return, I will forgive him.\r\n  E. R.\r\n\r\nThis is evidently from a relenting parent, whose sternness has been\r\nsubdued by the continued absence of his prodigal. Most likely the latter\r\nreturned, and went away again as soon as “the guv’nor” showed signs of\r\nresuming sway. And so on through one of those wretched dramas with which\r\nall people must be acquainted, in which the principal characters are a\r\nbroken-hearted mother, a worn-out and prematurely old father, and an\r\nutterly demoralised, drunken, and perhaps dishonest son, who is most\r\nlikely a brutal husband as well. Of quite another kind is this, which is\r\nalso from the _Times_:--\r\n\r\n  TO EQUATOR.--Fortuna audaces juvat. Vincit omnia veritas.--E. W.\r\n\r\nAs we have before remarked, the newspapers of to-day give us no such\r\nspecimens of secret and mysterious advertising as those we have\r\nunearthed, although the opportunities are far more numerous than--and we\r\npresume the occasions quite as frequent as--they were twenty years ago,\r\nfor every daily paper, and a good many of the weeklies, now keep special\r\ncolumns for the display of private announcements. Quite unique, however,\r\nin its way is one which appeared in _Lloyd’s_ half-a-dozen years ago. It\r\nsays that\r\n\r\n  =HARRIET AND HARRY COMPTON=\r\n  ARE well.--124, Stamford-street, Lambeth.\r\n\r\nThe ignorance may be crass, but we are bound to confess that even now we\r\nare not aware of the claims upon publicity of Mr and Mrs Compton. The\r\ninformation is given in style worthy of a royal bulletin, and doubtless\r\nit much interested all whom it may have concerned. A very faint attempt\r\nat cryptography is made in an advertisement which appeared comparatively\r\nrecently in one of the penny papers, the writer of which must have had\r\ngreat faith in the dulness of the British public if he thought that\r\nbackward writing would not be at once detected. This is it:--\r\n\r\n  LUCKY 6d. and 4d.!!--Came back by train a few minutes after meeting\r\n  you that forenoon, the only real reason for my coming. Always the same\r\n  feeling for you as expressed. Od etirw ecno ot pihs ot yas uoy evah\r\n  nees siht. Quite efas Rolias. Will sometimes advertise.\r\n\r\nThe next is a specimen of the present day, and is from the _Times_. Want\r\nof logical consequence is its chief characteristic:--\r\n\r\n  CANNOT mistake the decision of continued exceeding courtesy. Awaited,\r\n  but could not identify. Forgive, dear, if I have been too\r\n  superstitious. ’Tis the first fault, though twice repeated, and you\r\n  still hold the lash.\r\n\r\nReaders may possibly remember two rather singular advertisements which\r\nappeared in the _Telegraph_ quite recently, and were full of gratitude\r\nto the firm which had unwittingly led to a pleasant if questionable\r\nacquaintance between two persons. After this luncheon-baskets will\r\nprobably be carried by all gentlemen anxious for adventure--that is,\r\nwhen they travel on lines the authorities of which graciously permit\r\ntheir caterers to supply them. Here is the first:--\r\n\r\n  THE lady who travelled from Bedford to London by Midland train on the\r\n  night of the 4th inst., can now MEET the GENTLEMAN who shared with her\r\n  the contents of his railway luncheon basket. She enjoys the\r\n  recollection of that pleasant meal, and would like to know if he is\r\n  going on another journey. Will keep any appointment made at the\r\n  Criterion in Piccadilly.--Answer to A.\r\n\r\nThe application seems to have had the desired effect, for a day or two\r\nafterwards this was published:--\r\n\r\n  A. will meet you at the Criterion, on Wednesday, at three. Am going on\r\n  another journey shortly, and will provide luncheon-basket.--F. M.\r\n\r\nAny one who has travelled a distance by Midland or any other of the\r\nlines supplied with refreshments by Spiers & Pond, must have noted what\r\na great boon to the traveller is the well-stocked basket, which can be\r\ntaken in full at one station and delivered out wholly or partially\r\nempty, according as appetite serves, at another. Yet the luncheon-basket\r\nis a very small item in the revolutionisers’ total. Those who have\r\nsuffered under the old system of railway refreshments, will admit that\r\nSpiers & Pond fully deserve whatever credit has been given them for\r\ntheir efforts in the public interest. Ten years ago no man in his senses\r\nwould have dreamt of applying for food or drink at a railway buffet\r\nwhile he could go elsewhere; now Spiers & Pond daily serve thousands who\r\ndesert the old familiar taverns and crowd the bars at the various City\r\nstations. Among the many great feats in the way of providing for the\r\nhungry and the thirsty performed by this firm is one which has claims\r\nfor particular notice, as it is told in an official report of a\r\nWimbledon meeting. For the camping-time the following is the record: Of\r\nbread there were eaten 25,000 lbs.; of butter 3 tons; of cheese 1 ton;\r\nof bacon 11 cwt.; of hams 3 tons; of eggs 23,350; of rolls 52,677; of\r\nflour 36 sacks; of tea 1967 lbs.; and of coffee 2240 lbs.; 15 tons\r\nweight of meat were eaten, and 1446 fowls, with 626 ducklings, and 304\r\ngoslings. In the way of fish, the consumption of salmon reached 6200\r\nlbs., with 1667 soles, 400 turbot, 80 brill, and 2330 lobsters.\r\nVegetables were devoured to the amount of 12 tons, to which must be\r\nadded 40,000 lettuces and 500 quarts of shelled peas. In fancy pastry\r\n5000 pieces were made, with 1120 lbs. of biscuits, and 2460 quarts of\r\ncream and water ice. Add to these 720 baskets of strawberries, 75 lbs.\r\nof grapes, 400 pine-apples, 287 tongues, 10,800 bottles of aerated\r\nwaters, 896 plus 522 gallons of wine, 130 dozen and 312 gallons of\r\nspirits, 348 hogsheads of beer, 275 lbs. of tobacco, 300 boxes of\r\ncigars, 67 gallons of salad oil, 1½ hogshead of vinegar, 150 lbs. of\r\nmustard, 6000 gallons of claret cup, 13 cases of lemons, 84 tons of ice\r\nbrought direct from the ship’s side from Norway, 33 gallons of various\r\nsauces, 120 gallons of pickles, 25,000 sandwiches, 24 tons of sugar, 30\r\ncwt. of currants, and 25,000 lbs. of “Volunteer” plumcake. In addition\r\nto these, large quantities of wines, spirits, &c., were supplied to\r\nsutlers, messmen, and volunteers. On subsequent occasions, when, for\r\nreasons best known to themselves, the Rifle Association has provided its\r\nown commissariat, it has been discovered that the efforts of Spiers &\r\nPond were by no means overpraised at the time, and that the laudatory\r\nnotices received by the men who came from Australia to teach the mother\r\ncountry a profitable lesson were well deserved. Spiers & Pond have, it\r\nis true, met ample recognition from the press; yet now and again those\r\ngentlemen who consider it the whole duty of a journalist to sneer at\r\neverybody and everything have had their usual fling, and have written\r\nabout pretentious eating-house keepers, forgetful of the fact that a\r\ndozen years or so ago they were crying their eyes out because the weary\r\ntraveller in Great Britain could nowhere find the accommodation he was\r\nso anxious to pay for. We have been careful not to stray into the\r\nopposite extreme, though a long course of railway journeying under the\r\nold _régime_ of mouldy pork-pies and stale Banbury cakes has made us\r\nfeel very well disposed to a firm whose name has already passed into a\r\nproverb.\r\n\r\nSome little interest was exhibited in the annexed, which appeared in the\r\n_Times_ a few weeks back, and, according to the side espoused, looks\r\nlike just indignation or brutal intolerance:--\r\n\r\n  SHOULD this meet the eye of the lady who got into the 12.30 train at\r\n  New Cross Station on Friday, May 15, with two boys, one of whom was\r\n  evidently just recovering from an illness, she may be pleased to\r\n  learn that three of the four young ladies who were in the carriage are\r\n  very ill with the measles, and the health of the fourth is far from\r\n  what her relations could desire.\r\n\r\nIt has been quite the fashion to say how wrong it was of the lady with\r\nthe sick boys to get into a train and spread infection; and nobody seems\r\nto have thought that the poor lads wanted change of air--had perhaps\r\nbeen ordered it. As no special provision is made for the travelling\r\nsick--or for the matter of that, for the travelling healthy--the fault,\r\nif fault there be, lies not with the mother, who was anxious for the\r\nrecovery of her children, but with the railway authorities. Judging from\r\nthe tone of the advertisement, we should think that the advertiser would\r\nhave resented any interference had his or her young ladies been\r\ntravelling as invalids, instead of being in that state of health which\r\nis most subject to the attacks of disease. The case is hard, argued from\r\neither side, but it seems very unfair to cast the blame all one way.\r\n\r\nThe last example we shall give of this kind of advertising shows that\r\nextended space is used for “personals,” without any extension of\r\ninterest, the following being but a mild kind of raving on the part of a\r\nweak-minded man after an obstinate woman. It appeared early during the\r\npresent year (1874) in the _Telegraph_:--\r\n\r\n  MARY ANN C.--Do return home. You labour under an illusion. What you\r\n  wish to accuse me with does not exist. This I solemnly declare. I have\r\n  at last a good position, but am so wretched that I cannot attend to my\r\n  duties properly. Many happier returns of the 1st. God’s blessing be\r\n  with thee, and that He may tend thy heart to believe me in truth. Put\r\n  six years of love and happiness against your accusation, and you must\r\n  feel that you are wrong. Oh, you are very, very wrong. Do write and\r\n  give me an appointment, so that happiness may be re-established. You\r\n  must be very unhappy, but for God’s sake do not be so strong-minded.\r\n  My love and devotion are unaltered. For your own peace, my sweet,\r\n  pretty, good wife, come back. When death parts it is sad enough, but\r\n  to part while living, and without true cause, creates and leaves\r\n  wretchedness to both. Come back to your unhappy but true-loving\r\n  husband.\r\n\r\nThese last extracts are quite sufficient to show the style which now\r\nobtains in this class of advertisements, and to prove that what a score\r\nof years ago promised to be a never-ending source of amusement has\r\nbecome sadly deficient of its original properties.\r\n\r\nFamiliar to many people, among curious announcements, will be the\r\nfollowing, which is one of many similar that have from time to time\r\nappeared in the leading journal:--\r\n\r\n  THE CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER acknowledges the receipt of the first\r\n  halves of two £10 notes, conscience-money, for unpaid Income-Tax.\r\n\r\nThe man who sends conscience-money for income-tax must have been\r\nvirtuous indeed, if the evasion of that impost has been through life his\r\nworst sin. There are many otherwise estimable persons whose greatest\r\npride it is that they have never paid income-tax unless compelled. Yet\r\nthese men have in ordinary matters the greatest abhorrence of anything\r\nmean or paltry, and their general conduct might be safely contrasted\r\nwith that of the bestowers of conscience-money. So, after all, there is\r\nsomething more than a joke in the humourist’s idea of a grand new\r\npatriotic song called “Never pay your taxes till you’re summoned, my\r\nboys!”\r\n\r\nThose who wear artificial teeth must have been now and again\r\nindescribably shocked by advertisements like the following, which,\r\nscarce a short time back, are getting more and more frequent, so that\r\nwhat at first appeared a revolting riddle to the many, may have now\r\ndeveloped into a lucrative pursuit for the few. Is it right to suppose\r\nthat new sets of teeth are made up from second-hand materials? If so,\r\nhow horrible!\r\n\r\n  WANTED to PURCHASE some OLD ARTIFICIAL TEETH. Persons having the above\r\n  to sell can apply, with the teeth, or, if forwarded by post their\r\n  value will be sent per return.--Mr ----.\r\n\r\nTheatrical advertisements are, as has been remarked, often very funny,\r\nand whether from ignorance on the part of the writers, or the\r\nprevalence of technology, the columns of the _Era_ absolutely teem with\r\nstartling notices, which when coupled with the really remarkable as well\r\nas “original” correspondence, and the provincial critiques, make the\r\nchief theatrical organ one of the most genuine among comic papers, and\r\nthis is none the less so because the _Era’s_ comicality is\r\nunintentional. A fair specimen of the general style is given in an\r\nadvertisement appearing in March 1874, and if our reproducing it will be\r\nof any use to Messrs Gonza & Volta, they are quite welcome. In fact it\r\nwould be sad to think that such an effort should go unrewarded:--\r\n\r\n  Nil Admirari.\r\n\r\n  GONZA and VOLTA!!!\r\n\r\n  GONZA and VOLTA!!!\r\n  GONZA and VOLTA!!!\r\n\r\n  The Modern Hercules and Achilles. The Goliathan Gymnasts. The\r\n  Champions of Olympia Resuscitated. The greatest Athletes since the\r\n  Christian Era.\r\n\r\n  M. DE GONZA, the famous Mexican Athlete of the Golden Wing and Olympic\r\n  Club; also of Crystal Palace, Cirques Napoleon and de l’Imperatrice\r\n  celebrity, and late Proprietor of Gonza’s Transatlantic Combination\r\n  Company, has much pleasure in announcing that the Colossal Sensation\r\n  he is about submitting to the World’s criticism is in course of\r\n  progression, and that he has secured the services of EDOUIN VOLTA, the\r\n  grandest Aerial Bar Performer of the period, who will have the honour\r\n  of making his First Appearance in England in conjunction with M. DE\r\n  GONZA’S New Aerial Athletic Performance. M. DE GONZA, without desiring\r\n  to eulogise, prognosticates that his coming achievement will introduce\r\n  an astonishing epoch in gymnastics. In ancient days mythological\r\n  conceptions were framed by senile philosophers for the wonder and\r\n  delectation of the inhabitants of the world B.C., more particularly\r\n  during the existence of Rome under the Empire, when the stupendous\r\n  Colosseum lived in its glory, and where myriads witnessed the famous\r\n  gladiatorial combats. In those mighty days of heroism, when the great\r\n  pan-Hellenic festivals were held, every fourth year in Olympia,\r\n  instituted by Iphitus, King of Elis, the ninth century B.C., when\r\n  Athletic revels and Icarian games were as prevalent as cigar smoking\r\n  in this generation, people were more prone to countenance the possible\r\n  existence and marvellous exploits of the gods and goddesses.\r\n  Evanescent ages have flown by, and in the sentiments of millions there\r\n  now subsists a certain amount of familiarity with the intrepid and\r\n  valiant deeds of those illustrious mythological gods Hercules and\r\n  Achilles. They have been quoted and spoken of so often that their\r\n  fictitiousness is forgotten. They have ingratiated their fabulous\r\n  selves into the good graces of mankind, and become entwined around\r\n  their minds like the ivy around the gnarled and knotted oak; and,\r\n  although centuries have passed away, this nurtured concatenation of\r\n  deep-rooted imaginations have not proven altogether futile, for these\r\n  legendary and dauntless heroes actually do exist in the persons of\r\n\r\n  GONZA and VOLTA,\r\n  The Cyclopean Athletes of the Age.\r\n\r\n  Anchorites, ascetics, persons of secluded and fastidious natures,\r\n  stoics, and misanthropists, all will be metamorphosed into congenial\r\n  spirits, and be reconciled to the world and its pleasures after\r\n  witnessing these gigantillos and wonders of creation in the most\r\n  surprising and surpassingly elegant gymnastic exhibition hitherto\r\n  placed before an appreciative nation, the production of which due\r\n  notice will be given. Meanwhile all communications are to be addressed\r\n  to M. DE GONZA, ----.\r\n\r\nTurning from such extremely professional exponents of art and\r\nliterature, we are reminded of one who stands in quite an opposite\r\nposition to that of the Cyclopean athletes, Dr Vellère, the champion and\r\nforemost representative of the “unacted and unread,” of the theorists\r\nwho would regenerate the drama with their own works, and, if they could\r\nonly once be performed, would mark an epoch in the history of the stage.\r\nDoubtless they would. About five years ago the enthusiastic Doctor--who,\r\nbeing a foreigner, has a perfect right to regenerate the British drama,\r\nas well as the British Constitution--burst forth in the _Times_, and at\r\nonce placed himself at the head of that glorious minority which, owing\r\nto the iniquitous “ring” formed by a clique of authors, managers, and\r\ncritics, cannot get its plays, marvellously good as they are, produced;\r\nand thus not only they, but the great British public are sufferers under\r\na system which Vellère & Co. will yet expose or perish in the attempt.\r\nThe first advertisement of the regenerator appeared on October 2, 1869.\r\nIt ran thus:--\r\n\r\n  TO the PATRONS of the LEGITIMATE DRAMA and to the\r\n  PLAY-GOING PUBLIC in GENERAL.\r\n\r\n  Ladies and Gentlemen,--As a general outcry arose some considerable\r\n  time ago that there was a great dearth of good, original English\r\n  dramas, and as the recent so-called original productions of English\r\n  dramatists have failed to stifle it--because they have either traduced\r\n  English society or have been simply adaptations from the French\r\n  respecting a state of society which cannot exist here, and in both\r\n  cases have proved unpalatable to the English, and, therefore,\r\n  unsuccessful--I, who am a writer in more than one language, resolved\r\n  to produce a drama on purely English topics, and I was guided by the\r\n  dictum of your immortal poet, Byron, that “Truth is stranger than\r\n  fiction,” because all fictitious situations prove less “sensational”\r\n  (pardon me the vernacular), as produced by those dramatists, with all\r\n  the powerful accessories and machinery of the stage, than the simplest\r\n  police report from the daily papers. It took me more than a year of my\r\n  half-holidays to write the drama “Stern Realities,” and in about five\r\n  months I wrote the play “Trust.” Now, I have been trying for the last\r\n  eighteen months to have one of these pieces accepted, but all my\r\n  endeavours have been in vain. The excuse was, that I am not known (a\r\n  circumstance which, by-the-by, happened once to Shakespeare also), and\r\n  that it is far preferable to produce the works of authors already\r\n  known to the public, even if their more recent efforts have proved a\r\n  failure in more than one respect. It is now for the public of this\r\n  great country to decide whether this arrangement between Managers of\r\n  Theatres and a certain small clique of authors is a monopoly that is\r\n  to go on for ever; or whether it is only a false and preconceived\r\n  notion on the part of the former regarding the want of good taste for\r\n  superior productions on the part of the public. Though I am a\r\n  foreigner I consider myself as one of the public who has endeavoured\r\n  to amuse his fellow-citizens, but to whom no opportunity has hitherto\r\n  been afforded. However, as the author of a collection of songs, of\r\n  which some are written in English, French, and German, or English and\r\n  German, or simply in English poetry, and which volume is entitled\r\n  “Honi soit qui mal y pense,” and was collectively dedicated to the\r\n  Queen, and accepted by her Majesty, containing dedications also, by\r\n  special commission, to ladies of the highest titles, and to others\r\n  equally exalted in attainments, I beg you to believe me, when I assure\r\n  you, on the word of a gentleman, author, and schoolmaster, that the\r\n  two pieces I have written will meet with your approbation. I appeal\r\n  now to you, ladies and gentlemen, to assist me in bringing out one of\r\n  the two pieces; and, in my humble opinion, the most effectual way,\r\n  perhaps, in which this could be done, would be in addressing me a\r\n  note, kindly informing me which of the two pieces, “Stern Realities”\r\n  or “Trust,” should in your opinion be performed first, and that you\r\n  promise you will come to see either or both. Receiving thus from you a\r\n  great quantity of letters, I shall, armed with such a phalanx of\r\n  patronage, present myself as the bearer of the popular will to the\r\n  Manager of one of the London Theatres, and--we shall see! A letter\r\n  simply addressed thus, “Dr. Vellère, Harrow,” will safely reach me.\r\n  Trusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience, I remain,\r\n  ladies and gentlemen, very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n  E. R. W. VELLERE.\r\n\r\n  The English and Continental College,\r\n  Harrow, October 1st, 1869.\r\n\r\nBefore the attention directed to this novelty in literature had died\r\naway, another similar effusion appeared, and for about a twelvemonth the\r\n_Times_ contained every three or four weeks a message of direful import\r\nfrom Dr Vellère on dramatic monopoly and its probable ultimate effect on\r\ndramatic literature and the stage generally, varied by requests similar\r\nto those given here. Iniquity was still triumphant, however, and the\r\npatrons of the legitimate must have been unwilling to interfere, for at\r\nthe end of the year Dr Vellère was yet unacted. He is still busy writing\r\nplays, for he believes that success must come in the end; and if his\r\nliterary ability be in any way proportioned to his pertinacity, the\r\nchief of the Elizabethan roll of dramatists has at last met a worthy\r\nrival. Happily there is a way out of the difficulty with which Dr\r\nVellère and his friends are encompassed. Let them take a theatre, engage\r\nactors, and play each other’s dramas in turn. If they can only agree as\r\nto the order of production, and the relative merits of the pieces, they\r\nare sure to succeed; for if our experience goes for anything, the\r\nunacted and unread are sufficiently numerous to support any house of\r\nmoderate pretensions. But they mustn’t all want to be put on the free\r\nlist. That great distinction must be left for Dr Vellère and a chosen\r\nfew--composed, say, of friendly critics, and managers distraught with\r\nthe knowledge that priceless gems have been discarded, and that the new\r\nera has at last arrived.\r\n\r\n  [34] The letter written by the sailor with the artificial hands to the\r\n  printer of the _Caledonian Mercury_.\r\n\r\n  [35] Our information of this advertisement, and the clue to its\r\n  explanation, was, as already stated, obtained from an article in the\r\n  _Quarterly Review_. On reference to the _Times_ to discover whether\r\n  the Jefferies portion was right or not, we could not for a long time\r\n  find the particular notice we were in search of. At last, after the\r\n  above was written, under date February 10, it was found; and then we\r\n  saw that the word was “Jfhiiwola,” which subjected to the process as\r\n  above, will give the required name. We have preferred to explain this\r\n  in full, as the _Quarterly_ is undoubtedly entitled to the merit of\r\n  deciphering the puzzle, if not to anything else; and any alteration or\r\n  correction of ours would have detracted from such merit, which is\r\n  original, and without which the quaint libel might still have remained\r\n  in obscurity. Besides, it shows how a small printer’s error may spoil\r\n  the calculations of a week, in matters like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n_SWINDLES AND HOAXES._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is of course only natural that as soon as advertising became general,\r\nthat portion of the community which regards the other portion as its\r\noyster, was not slow to discover the advantages which were soon to\r\naccrue in the way of increased facilities for publishing new dodges, or\r\nof giving extended scope to those which were old, but had so far\r\nattained only limited circulation. This has been so conclusively shown\r\nby specimens already given, and references made, that there is no\r\nnecessity to discuss the question anew, and therefore we will at once\r\nplunge into the thick of those advertisements which have special\r\nqualifications for treatment different from that given to the milder\r\nclasses of rogues and scoundrels. The first transaction which calls for\r\nattention is in connection with Queen Anne’s farthings. No popular\r\ndelusion has perhaps made more dupes than that relating to these coins.\r\nInnumerable people believe that there never were but three farthings of\r\nthis description, two of which have found their way in due course to the\r\nBritish Museum, the third only being still abroad; and it is also\r\nbelieved that the Museum authorities would give a very large sum for the\r\npossession of the missing token. Now there are no less than six distinct\r\nvarieties of Anne’s farthings known to exist, and specimens of them are\r\nnot at all rare. Some of them may be procured at the coin-dealers, for\r\nten or twelve shillings; but there is one variety, struck in 1713, which\r\nis extremely rare, and would bring from £5 to £10. There is also a\r\nsmall brass medal or counter of Queen Anne, about the size of a\r\nfarthing, of which there are hundreds. A publican once procured one of\r\nthese, and placed it in his window, ticketed as “_the_ real farthing of\r\nQueen Anne.” Credulous persons came from far and near to view this\r\nwonderful curiosity, and the owner turned his deception to good account.\r\n\r\nSometime about the first quarter of this century, a man in Ireland\r\nreceived twelve months’ imprisonment for secreting a Queen Anne’s\r\nfarthing. He was shopman to a confectioner in Dublin, and having taken\r\nthe farthing over the counter, he substituted a common one for it.\r\nUnfortunately for him, he told his master how he had obtained it, and\r\noffered it to him for sale. The master demanded the treasure as his\r\nproperty, the shopman refused to give it up, was brought into the\r\nRecorder’s Court, and there received the above sentence. When rogues\r\nfall out, honest men know what they have lost. It is wrong to assume\r\nthat because thieves quarrel, their natural enemies “get their own.” At\r\nall events, experience has never taught us so, and the proverb, as\r\ngenerally read, is wrong.\r\n\r\nNumerous are the instances of people having travelled from distant\r\ncounties to London, in order to dispose in the best market of the\r\nsupposed valuable farthing. The custodian of the medals in the British\r\nMuseum used to be besieged by applicants from all parts of the country,\r\noffering Queen Anne’s farthings and imitations of them for sale, and of\r\ncourse the dealers in coin even now receive a liberal share of the same\r\nannoyance. Whence the treacherous fable originally sprung has never been\r\nsatisfactorily explained. It is certain that Anne’s farthings never were\r\nvery common, though of one variety, coined in 1714, not less than from\r\n300 to 500 must have been put in circulation. But the others were mere\r\npatterns, and were never struck for currency: all of them were coins of\r\ngreat beauty, and for this reason, as well as on account of their being\r\nthe only copper coins struck in the reign of Queen Anne, it is probable\r\nthat they were soon hoarded and preserved as curiosities, thereby\r\nacquiring an imaginary value, which grew rapidly as soon as some sharp\r\nfellow saw how useful the figment might be made. But the immediate cause\r\nof the popular fallacy concerning the scarcity and great value may be\r\nfound in the fact, that at the end of the last century a lady of\r\nYorkshire having lost one of these coins, offered a large reward for it.\r\nProbably it was valuable to her as a souvenir of some departed friend;\r\nbut the advertisement, and the comparative scarcity of these farthings,\r\ngradually led to the report that there was only one such token in\r\ncirculation, and that the unique coin was of course of almost priceless\r\nvalue. Long before this, however, advertisements in reference to Anne’s\r\nfarthings had found their way into the papers. So far as we can\r\ndiscover, the first of these appeared in the _General Advertiser_ of\r\nApril 19, 1745, and ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS about seven years ago an Advertisement was published in some\r\n  of the Daily Papers offering a Reward for a Queen Anne’s Farthing\r\n  struct in the year 1714.\r\n\r\n  _This is to inform the_ CURIOUS\r\n\r\n  That a Farthing of Queen Anne of that year of a very beautiful dye may\r\n  be seen at the Bar of the Pensylvania Coffeehouse in Birchin Lane. The\r\n  impression is no ways defaced but as entire as from the Mint.\r\n\r\nThis, probably, just at the time when a furor was in existence with\r\nregard to the farthings, must have given a fillip to the business at the\r\nPennsylvania Coffee-house; and must have done a great deal to spread the\r\nbelief that a Queen Anne’s coin was much more desirable than the\r\nwonderful lamp of Eastern story, or the more modern but quite as\r\npowerful four-leaved shamrock. That in 1802 the fiction was still lively\r\nis shown by an advertisement which appeared in the February of that\r\nyear. This was disguised so as to appear like an ordinary paragraph:--\r\n\r\n  The Queen Anne’s farthing, advertised to be disposed of in Pall Mall,\r\n  proves to be an original. There were only _two_ coined in that Queen’s\r\n  reign, and not _three_ as has been erroneously stated. That which was\r\n  sold by the sergeant from Chatham for £400, was purchased by a noble\r\n  viscount, curious in his selection of coins, &c. Seven Hundred guineas\r\n  was the price asked for the one advertised last week. Five hundred was\r\n  offered for it and refused. The owner lives at Lynn, in Norfolk. The\r\n  offer was made by the son of a baronet, who wants to complete his\r\n  collection.\r\n\r\nAttention and credulity were so excited by the above paragraph, and many\r\nothers of the same tendency, that no one thought of doubting that a\r\nQueen Anne’s farthing was worth more than a Jew’s eye; nor was it till\r\nsome time after that the whole was discovered to be a fabrication,\r\nintended either to impose upon the credulity of the public, or, what is\r\nmore likely, to enhance the value of such a coin to the holder, who was\r\nquietly waiting to realise. Whether he did so or not does not appear,\r\nbut it is more than likely that he did not allow his opportunity to\r\nslip, but hooked one of those unconsciously greedy people who are always\r\nfalling victims to their own selfishness as much as to the sharpers, and\r\nwho, as soon as they are deluded, look for sympathy and redress to those\r\nvery laws they were prepared to outrage when anything was apparently to\r\nbe got by so doing. The belief that Queen Anne’s farthings are very\r\nvaluable still obtains among the vulgar, notwithstanding the many times\r\nits absurdity has been exposed; and there is no particular reason for\r\nimagining that it will become at all exploded until some fresher but\r\nquite as illogical a fiction is ready to supply its place.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notorious swindlers of the early part of the present\r\ncentury was Joseph Ady, who used to profess that he knew “something to\r\nyour advantage.” As he did not deal in advertisements, perhaps he has no\r\nright here; but as about 1830 he was constantly being referred to in\r\nnewspaper paragraphs, and was a feature of the time among sharpers, he\r\nis entitled to passing notice, if only as a newspaper celebrity. At the\r\nperiod we mention, “Ady was a decent-looking elderly man, a Quaker,\r\nwith the external respectability attached to the condition of a\r\nhousekeeper, and to all appearance considered himself as pursuing a\r\nperfectly legitimate course of life. His _métier_ consisted in this. He\r\nwas accustomed to examine, so far as the means were afforded him, lists\r\nof unclaimed dividends, estates or bequests waiting for the proper\r\nowners, and unclaimed property generally. Noting the names, he sent\r\nletters to individuals bearing the same appellatives, stating that, on\r\ntheir remitting to him his fee of a guinea, they would be informed of\r\n‘something to their advantage.’ When any one complied, he duly sent a\r\nsecond letter, acquainting him that in such a list was a sum or an\r\nestate due to a person of his name, and on which he might have claims\r\nworthy of being investigated. It was undeniable that the information\r\n_might_ prove to the advantage of Ady’s correspondent. Between this\r\n_might be_ and the unconditional promise of something to the advantage\r\nof the correspondent, lay the debatable ground on which it might be\r\nargued that Ady was practising a dishonest business. It was rather too\r\nnarrow a margin for legal purposes; and so Joseph went on from year to\r\nyear reaping the guineas of the unwary--seldom three months out of a\r\npolice court and its reports--till his name became a byword; and still,\r\nout of the multitudes whom he addressed, finding a sufficient number of\r\npersons ignorant of his craft, and ready to be imposed upon--and these,\r\nstill more strange to say, often belonging to the well-educated part of\r\nsociety.”[36] In all the police cases we have come across, in which Ady\r\nwas concerned, he seems to have considerably “sat upon” the magistrates,\r\nthe “great unpaid” of the City being quite unable to hold their own with\r\nhim, notwithstanding the disadvantage at which Joseph was placed.\r\n\r\nThe claims for precedence of the two most important advertising\r\nswindles of the present day are so equally divided, that it is hard to\r\nsay which has caused the greater amount of ruin among credulous persons\r\nwho have invested their last few coins in the hope of the certain\r\nsuccess, or which has returned most profit to the exchequers of its wily\r\npromoters. The two claimants are the Turf-Circular and the\r\nHome-Employment swindles, both of which have been allowed full play. We\r\nwill give the “home-employment” arrangement preference of treatment, as\r\nit appeals to wider sympathies, the victims being mostly credulous only,\r\nand not selfishly and idiotically greedy for other folk’s goods; and\r\nbeing, as well, mostly poor hard-working women, and not a few children.\r\nOne of the most notorious of these advertisers flourished half-a-dozen\r\nyears ago. He used to insert a small notice in the daily papers,\r\ninforming those who had leisure that he could find ample remunerative\r\nemployment for them, and directing applications to be made by letter at\r\na given address, enclosing a stamped addressed envelope. Then the\r\nswindle commenced, the reply being as follows:--\r\n\r\n  GROVE HOUSE, TOTTENHAM ROAD.\r\n\r\n  ISLINGTON, LONDON, N.\r\n\r\n  _In reply to your application as per my Notice_ (Leisure Time, _&c._,\r\n  _&c._,) _I very respectfully inform you that it has now become\r\n  impossible to describe my Advertisement on employing leisure time\r\n  fully in the Newspaper in which the little abridged notice appeared,\r\n  owing to the enormous charge demanded for inserting it, namely £2 16s.\r\n  for each time it appears. So that in consequence I am compelled,\r\n  reluctantly, to trouble my correspondents to forward their envelope\r\n  for the purpose of an extended explanation, which I think cannot be\r\n  clearer done than my forwarding in print, as under, a copy of the\r\n  intended announcement, which after reading, and you deciding on\r\n  sending for the packet, please deduct from the number (eighteen) the\r\n  three Penny Postage Stamps you will necessarily have used, and only\r\n  enclose (fifteen) which trifling outlay I think you, like others, will\r\n  have no cause to regret._\r\n\r\n  _Yours faithfully_,\r\n\r\n  EVERETT MAY.\r\n\r\n  THE UNDER WILL BEST EXPLAIN:--\r\n  LEISURE TIME.--FOUR GUINEAS PER WEEK.--HOW TO REALISE\r\n  THIS AT YOUR OWN HOMES.\r\n\r\n  MR EVERETT MAY, of Kingsland, begs to apprise the Public that he is\r\n  sending off as rapidly as possible by every post his far-famed Packet,\r\n  the contents of which will show the many plans of getting money most\r\n  honourably by either sex employing leisure hours at their own homes.\r\n  £2 to £6 weekly may be most certainly realised by all industrious\r\n  persons, without five shillings outlay or any risk, by following the\r\n  easy, respectable and clear instructions. Sent by Mr Everett May, of\r\n  Grove House, Tottenham-grove, Kingsland, London, N. This is no\r\n  visionary theory. The Present Season highly suitable. Enclose eighteen\r\n  penny stamps, and you will receive post free punctually per return\r\n  THIS PROVED BOON TO THE INDUSTRIOUS OF BOTH SEXES.\r\n\r\n  But to remove any doubt that sceptical persons may entertain as to the\r\n  truth of the above, I here insert the under six letters received, with\r\n  hundreds of others. The parties are very respectable and each\r\n  well-known in the towns they reside.\r\n\r\n  Calverton, near Nottingham.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,--I beg to inform you that your packet came quite safe, and I\r\n  was surprised and highly pleased with its contents. Like others who\r\n  doubted the truth, I was ready to conclude it was only to catch those\r\n  foolish enough to try it. But I have now proved otherwise, and can\r\n  testify that you are no other than a true and faithful man. The\r\n  contents of your indeed famed packet are well worth twenty times as\r\n  much, and whoever the party may be receiving it will have no cause to\r\n  repent. Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n  SETH BINCH.\r\n\r\n  Another--Spettisbury, Blanford, Dorset.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,--I beg to inform you that the Packet ordered arrived safely,\r\n  and allow me to tender you my sincere thanks for it. Your plans for\r\n  getting money so honourably are indeed excellent. Anyone having a\r\n  doubt may most certainly remove such doubt. Hoping you may long\r\n  continue in your good work is the earnest wish of your obedient\r\n  servant,\r\n\r\n  W. OAKLEY.\r\n\r\nThen follow the remaining four letters, which have an astonishing family\r\nlikeness to the two chosen, and as these six were only inserted to show\r\nwhat the careful May would have done had he been able to launch into\r\nlavish expenditure in the interests of his clients, he gives a statement\r\nafter the last epistle:--\r\n\r\n  _Such is the exact copy of the advertisement I intended to have placed\r\n  before the public by inserting in the Newspapers had the charge not\r\n  been so high, but as I now do so by this circular I can add a few more\r\n  of my correspondents’ approval letters, in furtherance of a still more\r\n  convincing proof of the value of this esteemed Money Making Packet._\r\n\r\nAfter this he gives a string of letters, which must have demanded great\r\ningenuity on the part of their writer, if only on account of the number\r\nof signatures he must have invented. Occasionally he breaks down,\r\nhowever, and has to fall back on initials. We should like to reproduce a\r\nlot of these expressions of gratitude as forms to be used at any time\r\nwhen thanks are required for any great benefit, but space will not allow\r\nof it, and we must be content with two, which are redolent of truly\r\nChristian thankfulness:--\r\n\r\n  Short Heath Road, Erdington, near Birmingham, December 13th, 1867.\r\n\r\n  Mr. May, Dear Sir,--I have received your Packet, and am at a loss how,\r\n  adequately, to express to you what I think about it--suffice it to say\r\n  that I consider your Packet to be an inestimable boon to the\r\n  unemployed of every class. Thousands will, doubtless, make money by\r\n  it. It professes only to be a guide to the employment of leisure\r\n  hours, but in reality it is a guide to the employment of a whole life,\r\n  and an easy path to opulence. “Whoever receives it will have no cause\r\n  to regret.” “It is worth twenty times as much.” “Anyone having a doubt\r\n  may most certainly remove such doubt.” I heartily re-echo these\r\n  testimonials, and recommend your Packet to every unemployed person,\r\n  this is no more than I am in equity bound to do. I am, Dear Sir,\r\n  faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n  THOMAS JONSON, JUN.\r\n\r\n  1, Vincent Terrace, Frome, October 5th, 1867.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,--I have carefully examined the contents of your excellent\r\n  Packet, and am astonished and delighted with them. He or she would\r\n  indeed be difficult to please who could not select from so extensive a\r\n  stock some profitable employment congenial to their taste. The\r\n  instructions are explicit, and the minute details in each case fully\r\n  and clearly explained. A person of moderate industry and perseverance,\r\n  furnished with your Packet may attain, if not a fortune, at least a\r\n  very comfortable living. It ought to be widely known, and I for my\r\n  part shall not fail to recommend it. I admit I answered your\r\n  advertisement merely from a curious desire to know what was the latest\r\n  dodge (pardon the word) for hoaxing the public, and I am now heartily\r\n  glad I did answer it, though ashamed of the motive that induced me to\r\n  do so. I am, Dear Sir, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n  JOSEPH JOHNSON, Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nThe poor gulls, after reading these effusions, which all play on the\r\nsame strings of wonder, satisfaction, and gratitude, are of course\r\nanxious to participate in the benefits of lucrative employment, and off\r\ngo the stamps. If the mischief ended there, the matter would not be so\r\nbad; but these advertising scoundrels have various courses open to them.\r\nIf they judge that nothing more is to be obtained from the sender, they\r\ncalmly pocket the stamps and take no further notice. In the event of\r\ncontinued “annoyance,” or threats of exposure, they will send forth a\r\ncircular which states that a packet was posted, and must have been lost\r\nor stolen in transit. This circular speaks of the post-office, and other\r\ninstitutions, in the most disparaging manner, and of the transactions of\r\nits writers as not only just, but infallible. One of them winds up\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n  _Another matter I wish to inform you upon, namely, an error prevails\r\n  regarding the punctual and prompt conveyance of Packets by the Post\r\n  Office. This is at times impossible. If the letter mails are heavy,\r\n  Packets are sometimes left until the following day. So that I cannot\r\n  guarantee it will be delivered at your residence by return, but you\r\n  may fully expect it by the second if not by the first mail, postage\r\n  free, well packed, and secure from observation. These remarks may\r\n  appear trifling, but they are really necessary, and while on the\r\n  subject I will name another, also of importance, it is this--several\r\n  of my correspondents when applying for these particulars send only\r\n  their name and address on a stamped envelope, and when ordering the\r\n  Packet enclose their name and omit the address, and this not being\r\n  retained by me renders it impossible to forward it. So that a distinct\r\n  name and address is, in the second instance, absolutely necessary. It\r\n  is required for no other object than to enable me to promptly forward\r\n  the order, which I can do to any address in the United Kingdom._\r\n\r\nThe correspondent who dates from a good address, or whose letter looks\r\npromising, is likely to be despoiled still more. The stamps are\r\nacknowledged, and at the same time information is tendered that a\r\nspecial order for the peculiar fancy goods upon which the income is to\r\nbe made has just come in; and that if the intending employée will send a\r\nfee, say five shillings, for registration, and a deposit, say five\r\npounds, for security, she will receive a packet containing the\r\nwork--which is very easy--and ample instructions. A little delay enables\r\nthese wandering tribes to change both names and addresses, and to appear\r\nin greater force than ever in the advertisement columns. No wonder the\r\nwriters we have quoted show such gratitude for the receipt of promised\r\nparcels! But we did know two real people who got what they bargained\r\nfor. One, who only paid the eighteenpence, obtained, after a good long\r\ntime, and the expenditure of many threats, some scraps of brown paper,\r\nwhich were said to be patterns for pen-wipers, “the manufacture of which\r\nwould be found to yield a lucrative profit, if a market could be found\r\nfor them.” There is much virtue in an _if_ in this case. The paper went\r\non to say that there were many shopkeepers who would be glad to sell\r\nthem on commission, “the article being extremely rare.” It is noticeable\r\nthat the circular received on this occasion was printed, with blanks\r\nleft for description of the patterns and the name of the work for which\r\nthey were to be used. A man of imaginative mind might in the course of\r\nthe day have run through a considerable list of trades; and as the\r\nreference to the demand for the article and the sales by commission\r\nwould be the same in all the notices, the demand upon truth was\r\nevidently not particularly excessive. The other successful applicant was\r\na lady who began by writing out of mere curiosity, and who gradually got\r\non until she had parted with not much less than ten pounds. A sharp\r\nletter from a solicitor brought no answer to him, but succeeded in\r\nsending the long-expected parcel to his client. It was heavy, and\r\naccompanied by a short letter, which said:--\r\n\r\n  BIRMINGHAM, October 7, 1869.\r\n\r\n  MADAM,\r\n\r\n  We beg to inform you that some little delay has been caused by the\r\n  failure of a company to whom we entrusted the manufacture of a large\r\n  quantity of articles. We have now however great pleasure in forwarding\r\n  you a sample of an enamelled leather child’s button boot, with lasts\r\n  and leather for you to follow model. As soon as we receive from you\r\n  specimen equal to pattern we shall be glad to afford you constant\r\n  employment.\r\n\r\n  Yours obediently,\r\n\r\n  VENTNOR AND MORRIS.\r\n\r\nThe parcel contained some old odd lasts, a really well-made little boot,\r\nand some queer bits of leather, which the cleverest man in the world\r\ncould have done nothing with; a shoemaker’s knife, an awl, and a lump of\r\ncobbler’s wax! This expedient enabled the swindlers to tide over the\r\ntime till a new name and a fresh address were decided on. It is worthy\r\nof note--and we shall refer to it a little further on--that the\r\nstatement of one of these scoundrels would lead to the impression that\r\nextra prices are charged for these swindling advertisements. If larger\r\nprices are charged to men because their advertisements are fraudulent,\r\nno amount of false logic or forensic oratory can dispose of the fact\r\nthat the proprietors of the papers are accessories in any robbery or\r\nswindle that is committed; and the insertion of such advertisements,\r\nknowing them to be traps for the unwary, at a price which denotes the\r\nguilty knowledge of the proprietors, is as gross a breach of the trust\r\nreposed in them by the public as was ever committed by smug, well-fed,\r\nSabbath-observing sinners. There is, unfortunately, but too much reason\r\nto believe that extra prices are charged for these fool-traps, and that\r\nin the most pious and pretentious papers. At the time of the\r\nbaby-farming disclosures which led to the execution of Margaret Waters,\r\none paper openly accused another--a daily of large circulation--with\r\ncharging three or four hundred per cent. over the ordinary tariff price\r\nfor the short applications for nurse children which were then usual.\r\nPerhaps the accusation was not worth disproval--at all events it remains\r\nuncontradicted till this day. These murderous advertisements presented\r\nno particularly destructive features, they simply said in each case that\r\na nurse child was wanted at a certain address; and sometimes an offer\r\nwould be made to take a baby altogether for a lump sum. This is one of\r\na lot taken from a leading daily paper:--\r\n\r\n  ADOPTION.--Child Wanted to NURSE, or can be LEFT ALTOGETHER. Terms\r\n  moderate. Can be taken from birth. Address ----.\r\n\r\nSometimes the terms were mentioned, and, as a rule, the sum named showed\r\nthat even the tender mercies experienced by Oliver Twist and his friend\r\nDick at the farming establishment inhabited by them could hardly have\r\nbeen expected by the most confiding of parents. Thus:--\r\n\r\n  A RESPECTABLE Woman wishes to adopt a CHILD. Premium £6. Will be taken\r\n  altogether and no further trouble necessary. Apply ----.\r\n\r\nAs some of these establishments may be still in existence, we refrain\r\nfrom republishing the addresses. These specimens, as advertisements,\r\nsimply call for no comment at our hands, and so we will get on with the\r\nmore pronounced, though less guilty, swindlers. Here is a specimen which\r\ndoubtless gave the postman some extra work:--\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN having a respectable circle of acquaintance may hear of\r\n  means of INCREASING their INCOME without the slightest pecuniary risk,\r\n  or of having (by any chance) their feelings wounded. Apply for\r\n  particulars by letter, stating their position &c. to W. R. 37, W----\r\n  Street C---- Square.\r\n\r\nTo such an advertisement as this--one of exactly the same kidney--which\r\nappeared in _Lloyd’s_, under the head of “How to make Two pounds per\r\nWeek by the outlay of Ten Shillings,” and asking for thirty stamps in\r\nreturn for the information, the following belongs. It is sent in reply\r\nto the letter enclosing the fee, and is too good a specimen of the\r\nhumour possessed by these rogues to be passed over:--\r\n\r\n“First purchase 1 cwt. of large-sized potatoes which may be obtained for\r\nthe sum of 4s., then purchase a large basket, which will cost say\r\nanother 4s., then buy 2s. worth of flannel blanketting and this will\r\ncomprise your stock in trade, of which the total cost is 10s. A\r\nlarge-sized potato weighs about half-a-pound, consequently there are 224\r\npotatoes in a cwt. Take half the above quantity of potatoes each evening\r\nto a baker’s and have them baked; when properly cooked put them in your\r\nbasket, well wrapped up in the flannel to keep them hot, and sally forth\r\nand offer them for sale at one penny each. Numbers will be glad to\r\npurchase them at that price, and you will for certain be able to sell\r\nhalf a cwt. every evening. From the calculation made below you will see\r\nby that means you will be able to earn £2 per week. The best plan is to\r\nfrequent the most crowded thoroughfares, and make good use of your\r\nlungs, thus letting people know what you have for sale. You could also\r\ncall in at each public-house on your way and solicit the patronage of\r\nthe customers, many of whom would be certain to buy of you. Should you\r\nhave too much pride to transact the business yourself (though no one\r\nneed be ashamed of pursuing an honest calling), you could hire a boy for\r\na few shillings a week who could do the work for you, and you could\r\nstill make a handsome profit weekly. The following calculation proves\r\nthat £2 per week can be made by selling baked potatoes:--\r\n\r\n  “1 cwt. containing 224 potatoes sold in two evenings at\r\n  1d. each,                                       £0 18 8\r\n                      Deduct cost,                 0  4 0\r\n                                                  -------\r\n                                                  £0 14 8\r\n                                                        3\r\n                                                  -------\r\n                      Six evenings’ sale,          2  4 0\r\n  Pay baker at the rate of 8d. per evening\r\n      for baking potatoes,                         0  4 0\r\n                                                  -------\r\n                      Nett profit per week,       £2  0 0.”\r\n\r\nMany and most curious are the answers received from time to time by\r\npersons with sufficient faith to make application to these advertisers,\r\nthe foregoing being by no means unique. One reply received in return for\r\nhalf-a-crown’s worth of stamps, which were to have purchased much wisdom\r\nin the way of money-saving, was this: “Never pay a boy to look after\r\nyour shadow while you climb a tree to see into the middle of next week.”\r\nA man who would send his money to such evident scamps, could hardly see\r\ninto the middle of anything, no matter where he chose his\r\nvantage-ground. Fortunately for the interests of the community at large,\r\nthese tricksters now and again are made to feel that there is justice in\r\nthe land. Twenty years ago, a City magistrate did good service by\r\nexposing a man who lived abroad in splendour at the expense of the poor\r\ngovernesses he managed to victimise through the advertising columns of\r\nthe _Times_. This rascal used, by means of the most specious promises,\r\nto drag young girls to a foreign land, and there leave them to become a\r\nprey to other villains, or to make their way back accordingly as\r\ncircumstances permitted. But as at the present time there are streams of\r\nforeign girls decoyed to London under all sorts of pretexts for the\r\nvilest purposes, the least said as to the criminality of one single\r\nindividual among the shoals of scoundrels who live by means of\r\nadvertisements the better. Since Mr Fynn was unmasked many other hawks\r\nhave been captured, and only recently two have found their way into the\r\nobscurity of penal servitude under circumstances worthy of mention.\r\n_Place aux dames_: we will give precedence to Mistress Margaret Annie\r\nDellair, though her retirement was subsequent to that of the other\r\nclaimant on our attention. The difference of date is, however, extremely\r\nsmall. Mrs Dellair lived at Croydon, and for a long time lived in peace\r\nand plenty on the post-office orders, or rather the cash received in\r\nexchange for them, obtained by means of the following advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  HOME EMPLOYMENT.--Ladies in town or country wishing for Remunerative\r\n  EMPLOYMENT in Laces, Church Needlework, &c., should apply at once to\r\n  M. D., Fern House, West Croydon, enclosing a directed envelope.\r\n  Reference to ladies employed by permission.\r\n\r\nThis must have been a fruitful source of income to M. D., who seems to\r\nhave considered that people were calmly content to part with their\r\nmoney, as she made no attempt to put off the day of reckoning which was\r\nbound to arrive. So in due course Mrs Dellair found herself charged with\r\nfraud before the Croydon bench, and ultimately she appeared at the bar\r\nof the Central Criminal Court in April of the present year. Her mode of\r\nprocedure, described during the trial, was this. Applicants in due time,\r\nafter sending in their stamped and addressed envelopes, received\r\ncirculars, stating that the work which the sender was able to furnish\r\ncomprised braiding, point lace, tatting, church needlework, and Berlin\r\nwool. The needlework was to be done at the ladies’ homes, and they were\r\nnever to earn less than eightpence or a shilling per hour. To secure\r\nemployment the applicants were informed that the payment of one guinea\r\n“for registration fee, materials, and instruction,” was required, half\r\nof which sum was to be returned when the employment was resigned.\r\nPost-office orders were to be made payable at the office, Windmill\r\nStreet, Croydon, to Margaret Dellair. “There is,” says a writer at the\r\ntime commenting on this case, “something quite admirable in this calm\r\nrepudiation of the anonymous, in this wearing of the heart upon the\r\nsleeve, on the part of Mistress Dellair. The bait she threw out was\r\nswallowed with avidity by many young ladies--some with more money than\r\nwit, others painfully anxious to secure bread-winning employment; others\r\nless solicitous about procuring work for themselves than inquisitive to\r\ndiscover, for the benefit of society in general and their friends in\r\nparticular, whether the transaction was _bonâ fide_. Then the curtain\r\nrose on the second act of the drama. Some ladies sent post-office\r\norders to Windmill Road; others took the train to Croydon, and had\r\npersonal interviews with the benevolent recluse of Fern House--a little\r\ncottage near a wood--who did not fail to represent that she was\r\nextensively employed by some eminent firms of church furnishers in the\r\nmetropolis.” One young lady having sent her guinea, received, after a\r\nlapse of some weeks, and after repeated communications on her part, ten\r\ntoilet-mats, with the materials for braiding them. There was not enough\r\nbraiding, and so she wrote for more, but received no reply. Then she\r\nfinished the mats with materials purchased by herself, and despatched\r\nthe articles to Croydon; but neither reply nor payment was forthcoming.\r\nAfter many more weeks Mrs Dellair wrote to say that she was in\r\nill-health. Seeing, however, that the advertisement was continued in the\r\npapers, the defrauded young lady wrote to Fern Cottage, demanding the\r\nreturn of ten shillings, being one-half of the sum she had disbursed for\r\n“registration fee, materials, and instruction.” No answer was returned,\r\nof course; and the victim not only lost her money, but her time and her\r\nlabour, to say nothing of postage, worry of mind, and other incidental\r\nexpenses. One of the principal witnesses against Dellair was the Croydon\r\npostmaster, who stated that he had known her a year and a half. She had\r\nbeen in the habit of bringing post-office orders to his office to cash.\r\nShe had brought between three and four hundred orders since July 1872,\r\nprincipally for guineas, but there were some for half-crowns and some\r\nfor half-guineas. They were brought principally by her daughter, but\r\nsometimes by a servant. On the 30th of October 1873 a post-office order\r\n(produced) was brought to him, and the payee’s signature was that of the\r\nprisoner. He paid the money to the person who brought it. The house at\r\nwhich the prisoner lived was a small private house, called Fern Cottage,\r\nand there was no show of business kept up there. On cross-examination by\r\nprisoner’s counsel, the postmaster stated that the fact of so many\r\norders being cashed by Mrs Dellair excited his suspicion. He, however,\r\nknew that she was getting her living by sending parcels of needlework by\r\npost, and since he had ascertained that fact, he did not think it so\r\nextraordinary. Mrs Dellair was in the habit of purchasing postage stamps\r\nin large quantities of him. She sometimes purchased ten shillings’\r\nworth, and once or twice had bought them to a larger extent. At the\r\ntrial the entire seat in front of the jury-box was filled by young women\r\nwho attended to prosecute, some of whom had been prudent enough to ask\r\nfor references, but imprudent enough to part with their guineas,\r\nalthough the testimonials received were not quite satisfactory. Some\r\napplicants had interviews with Dellair at Croydon, and then she gave the\r\nnames of one or two eminent firms as her employers, but at the trial\r\nrepresentatives of these firms swore that she was totally unknown to\r\nthem. One of the most peculiar points in this trial was the line taken\r\nby the counsel for the defence, who argued that although the victims of\r\nhis client might be deserving of sympathy, they had parted with their\r\nguineas in a foolish and careless manner, and the real question was\r\nwhether the accused was guilty of a fraudulent pretence or not. The\r\nadvocate raised the curious point in favour of his client, that although\r\nshe had avowedly four hundred transactions with different persons, it\r\nwas extraordinary that she had not been discovered and prosecuted\r\nbefore; but he forgot how much more extraordinary it was that for her\r\ndefence the prisoner was unable to bring forward out of her four hundred\r\nclients a single witness who could swear to receiving remunerative\r\nemployment from her. The defence was original, and originality in\r\ndefence has a good deal to do with success when a case is being tried by\r\na common jury; but it did not succeed, and Mrs Margaret Annie Dellair\r\nwas found guilty. The woman was an impudent and abandoned swindler, who\r\nhad been systematically preying for years upon a class that can, of all\r\nclasses, the least afford to be cheated--decently-educated young women\r\nof small means, who fill respectable positions, and whose consequent\r\nneed of employment which will enable them to earn a little something\r\nabove their ordinary salaries is always pressing and frequently\r\nimperative. Before sentence was passed an inspector from Scotland Yard\r\nstated that the prisoner and her husband had formerly lived at Finchley\r\nunder another name; that they had afterwards kept a shop in Bloomsbury\r\nunder the title of “Fuller & Co.,” where they advertised to give\r\n“remunerative employment” both to young ladies and young gentlemen; that\r\nin May 1872 the husband was sentenced at the Middlesex Sessions to five\r\nyears’ imprisonment for fraud; that on his conviction the woman removed\r\nto Fern Cottage; and that after her arrest, and its consequent\r\npublication in the papers, upwards of eighty letters had been received\r\nby the police complaining of her dealings. All that Margaret Annie\r\nDellair could do when she was called up for sentence was to plead that\r\nshe had been left in an all but penniless condition with seven young\r\nchildren; that she had tried in vain to obtain an honest livelihood by\r\nkeeping a stall in a bazaar; and that her crime was caused by a desire\r\nto avert starvation from her innocent offspring. A good deal of sympathy\r\nwas of course expressed by the public--especially by those who have\r\nnothing to lose--not for the victims, but for the victimiser. The\r\ninterest taken in criminals nowadays, when they have the slightest\r\nclaims to be out of the common order, would be regarded as quite\r\noverdrawn if described in a novel.\r\n\r\nThe other delinquent was not so interesting, and being only a man, did\r\nnot find any hearts to bleed for him even among those who had not been\r\ndeceived. His practices were provincial, his advertisement, of which the\r\nfollowing is a copy, being inserted in the Warwickshire and London\r\npapers:--\r\n\r\n  HOME EMPLOYMENT.--Ladies (several) wanted to COPY manuscript SERMONS\r\n  for supply to the clergy. Reasonable terms. Apply by letter only to R.\r\n  H., 39, New-buildings, Coventry.\r\n\r\nR. H. was Robert Hemmings, who was eventually tried at the Warwick\r\nAssizes of last March, and whose _modus operandi_ was then described.\r\nSeveral young ladies seeing the advertisements, and wishing for\r\nemployment, wrote to the address given, in answer to which they received\r\nthe “Prospectus of the Private Office for the Supply of Sermons and\r\nLectures to Clergymen and Public Speakers.” In this highly-titled and\r\npretentious document, clergymen “who find the composition of sermons too\r\nheavy a tax on their ingenuity, are invited to subscribe for manuscript\r\nsermons, arranged according to the three schools of thought in the\r\nEnglish Church. The High Church section is subdivided into Ritualistic\r\nand moderate Anglican. The subscription for three sermons weekly is four\r\nguineas per annum, payable in advance. The same sermon will not be sent\r\nto any two clergymen within twenty miles of each other.” It also states,\r\nthat the business of the office rendering necessary the employment of\r\ncopyists, it has been decided to employ ladies only, the reason being\r\nthat home occupation to gentlewomen of limited income is such a great\r\ndesideratum of our times. Then it goes on to say that “the ordinary\r\navenues for respectable women desiring to replenish their scanty purses\r\nare so overstocked that the limited number we are able to employ will\r\ngladly welcome the opportunity of turning a fair handwriting to a\r\nprofitable account. The remuneration paid will be 2d. per 100 words. To\r\navoid the possibility of unscrupulous persons obtaining valuable sermons\r\non pretence of copying, a guarantee of 10s. will be required from each\r\ncopyist before MSS. are sent, to be returned when she may discontinue\r\nworking. Applicants for employment should enclose 2s. 6d. on account of\r\ntheir deposit, which will either be returned or a notification of\r\nengagement sent. In the latter case the balance must then be remitted,\r\nin order that the first parcel may be supplied. All communications to be\r\nsent to Mr Robert Hemmings, 39, New-buildings, Coventry.” One young lady\r\nresident in London, who gave evidence, sent the half-crown, and then\r\nreceived a letter stating that she would be employed on forwarding a\r\npost-office order to Birmingham for 7s. 6d. She did not do so, but many\r\nother ladies were not so wise. The prisoner having obtained the money,\r\nceased to communicate with the applicants. The jury found the prisoner\r\nguilty, and the judge sentenced him to twelve months’ imprisonment with\r\nhard labour.\r\n\r\nA more fortunate rogue was one who came into notice at the Sussex\r\nAssizes four or five years back. Justice may or may not have overtaken\r\nhim since, for these fellows have so many and such various aliases that\r\nunless you happen to see one tried and hear him sentenced, there is no\r\nway of telling who he is or what he may have been. The object of our\r\ncare at the present moment was known at Bognor in Sussex as Henry\r\nWatkis, though as he admitted to one more name, the suggestive one of\r\nWalker, even there, it would be difficult to say what might be his name\r\nin London or any other large town. He used to advertise to procure\r\nsituations in London daily and weekly papers, and some complaints having\r\nbeen made to the police, he was taken into custody on a warrant, and\r\nappeared at the Chichester Quarter Sessions. From a newspaper report of\r\nthe time we take some of the following particulars of what must be\r\nconsidered a decided miscarriage of justice.\r\n\r\nWatkis lived at 6 Jessamine Cottages, Bognor, and when the\r\nsuperintendent of police from Chichester searched his cottage, he found\r\nunder the stairs 530 letters, consisting of testimonials, replies to,\r\nand drafts of advertisements; and in another part of the house he found\r\nabout 150 envelopes, apparently sent for replies, from which stamps had\r\nbeen cut. When Watkis was apprehended, he acknowledged that he was the\r\nperson who had been advertising in the name of “B. C., Post-office,\r\nChichester,” by which it seems that he had still another alias, though\r\nnot in Bognor. On that day he sent a lad to the Chichester post-office,\r\nand a large bundle of letters, addressed as above, was brought back from\r\nthe office. In the course of a few days after Watkis’s apprehension,\r\nbetween seven and eight hundred letters were received at the post-office\r\nall directed in the same way. Evidence was given that advertisements\r\nwere inserted in the _Daily Telegraph_ and _Lloyd’s_ in consequence of\r\norders received in letters signed “Hy. Watkis,” and “Hy. Walker.” About\r\n500 letters were received at Chichester, addressed “X. Y. Z,” in\r\naccordance with one of the advertisements, and a very large number were\r\nalso received at Emsworth under still a fresh set of initials.\r\nAltogether nearly 20,000 letters are supposed to have been sent to the\r\ntwo offices for the accused. It was proved that 34s. worth of stamps,\r\nall singles, had been sold by Watkis. At the conclusion of the address\r\nfor the prosecution, the deputy recorder ruled that there was no case to\r\ngo to the jury as far as the law was concerned. There was no proof that\r\nWatkis had, either on his own part or on that of others, no such\r\nsituations to offer as had been advertised. The jury were not satisfied\r\nwithout hearing the evidence that the prisoner was not guilty. The\r\ndeputy recorder said they had placed him in a very difficult position,\r\nand he must tell them again that the indictment could not be maintained\r\nin point of law. Therefore they would be doing a very irregular thing to\r\ngo into the case. It was for them to find a verdict in accordance with\r\nthe ruling of the court on the point of law. After some discussion the\r\njury returned into court, and the foreman, in answer to the usual\r\nquestion, said, “If we are obliged to say not guilty, we must; but the\r\njury wish to express a strong opinion.” By advice of the deputy\r\nrecorder, however, this opinion was not recorded, and the prisoner was\r\naccordingly discharged.\r\n\r\nWe will wind up this portion of our list of swindles with an\r\nadvertisement of the same order, which succeeded in realising a good\r\nincome for its promoter:--\r\n\r\n  LADIES and EDUCATED WOMEN are respectfully invited to consult Mrs.\r\n  EGGLESTON’S SERIES of 60 HOME and other NEW EMPLOYMENTS, which are\r\n  beginning to attract a large share of public interest for their marked\r\n  superiority over very unremunerative pursuits usually engaged\r\n  in.--Enclose an addressed stamped envelope to Mrs Eggleston, ----,\r\n  Ramsgate, for prospectus.\r\n\r\nSixty different businesses to choose from for home employment! Dollseye\r\nand leather-apron weaving was doubtless among them; and in sorting out\r\nthose occupations most suited to her various correspondents, Mrs\r\nEggleston doubtless passed a pleasant time at the seaside, even if she\r\ndid not lay up riches against the time she returned to London.\r\n\r\nTurf-swindlers are next upon our list, and no one will doubt that these\r\ngentry are well deserving of attention, the more so as, partly by\r\nthemselves, and partly by means of the shortsightedness peculiar to the\r\npublic, which causes it to form judgments on subjects it does not\r\nunderstand, welchers and thieves who advertise the most impossible\r\n“certainties” have been in numerous instances taken to represent the\r\nrespectable and honourable turfite. We know it is the custom now to\r\nassume that a man is bound to be dishonourable if he be professionally\r\nconnected with racing in any capacity; and any effort made to contradict\r\nwholesale and thoughtless accusations is supposed to be the outcome of\r\nself-interest, or the blind devotion of quixotry. Men who are cool and\r\ncalculating enough when discussing ordinary subjects, become almost\r\nrabid when the turf is mentioned; and in most articles which have been\r\nwritten on the subject of sporting advertisements, it is assumed that\r\nthe scheming concocters of baits for fools are fair representatives of\r\nthe bookmaking class, and all are alike denounced. Surely it would be as\r\njust to assume that the baby-farmers and promoters of home employment\r\nwhose effusions we have quoted were fair representatives of ordinary\r\ncommerce, as that the “discretionary-investment” promoter is in any way\r\nconnected with the legitimate bookmaker. We have no wish here to argue\r\nfor or against betting; but we cannot help noticing that even in\r\nParliament--which is never supposed to legislate upon what it does not\r\nunderstand!--notorious thieves have been taken to represent the\r\nprincipal advertising bookmakers, and long arguments as to the equity of\r\nthe Betting-House Act framed on the assumption. During the present year\r\nthere has been considerable discussion in the House of Commons with\r\nreference to the Act which was passed in 1853, Scotland being at the\r\ntime exempt from its operation. The effect of leaving the “land of\r\ncakes” in the position of one who is known to be too virtuous to need\r\nprotection was not visible for some years; for though the Act of Sir\r\nAlexander Cockburn had the effect of clearing away the numerous\r\nbetting-offices, which were undoubtedly at the time public nuisances and\r\nopen lures to men whose speculative disposition was in inverse\r\nproportion to its means of gratification, the better-class agents, whose\r\nbusiness was carried on through the post only, continued to flourish or\r\ndecay, according to circumstances, until 1869. The attention of the\r\npolice being then drawn to numerous advertisements which appeared in the\r\nLondon and provincial papers on the subject of betting, a raid was made\r\non a large establishment near Covent Garden: books and papers, clerks\r\nand managers, were seized and conveyed to Bow Street; and though the\r\nemployés were ultimately discharged, the proprietor was ultimately fined\r\nheavily, the decision of the magistrate being eventually endorsed by the\r\njudges to whom the case was referred on appeal. A flight of betting men\r\nresulted, the resting-place of some being Glasgow, and of others\r\nEdinburgh; from both of which places they put forth their advertisements\r\nas before, safe in the knowledge that so far, at all events, the law was\r\non their side. The extension of the Act of 1853 was of course only\r\nmatter of time; but the first two or three efforts failed signally,\r\nprincipally on account of the blind animosity of the promoters of the\r\nmeasure, which caused them to frame bills which, for intolerance and\r\nhopeless stupidity, have perhaps never been equalled. Another cause was\r\na feeling that, while one form of betting was allowed at Tattersall’s\r\nand the chief sporting clubs--a form which had shown itself equal to\r\nruining several peers and hundreds of young men of less degree--it was\r\nimpolitic to over-legislate with regard to the half-crowns and\r\nhalf-sovereigns of working men and small tradesmen, and to say to them,\r\nwhile yet the terrible “plunging” years were fresh in memory, “Dukes and\r\nmarquises only shall ruin themselves at will, you, the common people,\r\nmust be saving as well as industrious.”\r\n\r\nAt last Mr Anderson, one of the members for Glasgow, introduced his\r\nExtension Bill (1874), and though his arguments were eminently\r\nridiculous, as he assumed that every advertiser was a swindler, his\r\nlegislative attempt was a much greater success than any former effort\r\nhad been in the same direction, and his bill, with a few modifications,\r\neventually became law. As an instance of the feeling to which this\r\nmeasure gave rise, we quote part of a criticism upon it from the most\r\nable of the sporting papers which make the turf their principal study,\r\nthe _Sportsman_, the first journal that refused the advertisements of\r\nswindlers whose intentions were evident, a method of self-abnegation\r\nwhich might be studied to advantage by many virtuous newspapers, which,\r\nwhile they weep over the iniquity of sporting advertisements, are\r\nstrangely oblivious as to the character or effect of those which appear\r\nin their own columns. It must be remembered that the “ring” and\r\nTattersall’s betting--of which mention is made in the following--is not\r\ninterfered with by law, because nothing is staked before the decision of\r\nthe race but “honour.” This, being often deeply mortgaged, is found\r\ninsufficient for the demand when settling-day arrives.\r\n\r\nSays the writer in the _Sportsman_, after demolishing several of the\r\ncharges made against ready-money betting: “Take the case of those who\r\nbet in the ring, or at Tattersall’s, or in the clubs. What guarantee is\r\nthere between the contracting parties that there shall be no element of\r\nfraud, and consequently no immorality in the transaction? And what\r\nguarantee is there that one or other of the contracting parties who is\r\ninduced to bet is not a person who cannot afford to lose? There is an\r\ninducement to bet on either side: on the side of the layer and on the\r\nside of the backer, and will any one acquainted with the subject be\r\nprepared to say that in scores of cases there is not on both parts a\r\ntotal inability to pay in the event of loss? What man is there who,\r\nhaving seen much of the ring, cannot recall many instances of layers\r\nbetting to such an extent that they could never pay if the fates were\r\nagainst them, and of backers ‘having’ the ring all round without a\r\nsovereign in their pockets? Nay, cannot even the general public who are\r\nnot initiated into such mysteries remember numbers of men who have\r\nruined themselves and others under the system in which Mr Anderson ‘does\r\nnot feel there is any immorality,’ because in it ‘the element of fraud\r\nis not introduced,’ and because under it ‘people who cannot afford to\r\nlose’ are not induced to bet? The result of his bill will be that he\r\nwill drive men from one style of betting, in which they lose or win,\r\nknowing the extent of their gains or their losses, to another, under\r\nwhich they may be drawn into hopeless speculation, and perhaps\r\nconcomitant fraud, simply because they are not called on for ready\r\nmoney. We do not propose to follow Mr Anderson through his ingenious and\r\namusing descriptions of the advertisements of tipsters and\r\n‘discretionary-investment’ people. He was good enough to introduce\r\nourselves as a striking example of the facility with which such persons\r\ncould foist their schemes on the public, and of the large profits which\r\nwere derived by certain newspaper proprietors from them. He had the\r\nhonesty to acknowledge that we had refused to take any further\r\nannouncements with respect to ‘discretionary investments,’ and that we\r\nhad persistently cautioned our readers to have nothing to do with\r\nthem.... As for tipsters, who merely offer to give information for a\r\nshilling’s worth of stamps, what immorality can there be in that which\r\nis not to be found in the ‘selections’ of the daily newspapers? Even the\r\n_Times_, in a roundabout ‘respectable’ way, now and then indicates\r\nhorses which, in the opinion of its sporting writer, will win certain\r\nraces, and there is hardly a daily paper in town or country which has\r\nnot its regular ‘prophet,’ who from day to day lifts up his voice or his\r\npen and offers inducements to the public to bet. Can any one of such\r\njournals say to us, ‘I am holier than thou, because I sell my prophecies\r\nfor a penny, and thou insertest the advertisements of men who want a\r\ndozen stamps for theirs’? But the whole policy of objecting to certain\r\nclasses of advertisements is absurd. If the proprietor of a newspaper\r\nwere to inquire, even superficially, into the _bona fides_ of all the\r\nannouncements he makes every day, his journal could not be conducted. If\r\nhe were even to confine his attention to the examination of the\r\nprospectuses of joint-stock companies--and this will appeal to Mr\r\nAnderson--he would be in the Bankruptcy Court in six months. Suppose the\r\ndirectors of any one of hundreds of bubble concerns which every year\r\ncarry away the public with ‘bogus’ announcements were to appear before\r\nthe manager of the _Times_ with their prospectuses, what would they\r\nthink if he said, ‘Gentlemen, before I insert this you must prove to me\r\nthat it is not a gross swindle;’ and how would they proceed to do so?”\r\n\r\nWe admit to a weakness for reading the sporting papers, and can\r\ntherefore vouch for the truth of what the _Sportsman_ says about its own\r\naction. It would have been well, however, if other papers had been as\r\ncareful, for we happen to know that all the contemporaries of the\r\njournal from which we have quoted did not come out with quite such clean\r\nhands. Some not only continued to insert the advertisements, despite\r\nnumerous complaints, but actually _doubled the usual tariff price_ to\r\nthe thieves. This seems to have been a pretty general proceeding when\r\nthe discretionary movement was at its height, all papers which continued\r\nto insert the specious swindles after the exposures had begun being very\r\ncareful to be well paid for their trouble. As in these days the plain\r\ntruth is often the most desperate of libels, we must refrain from\r\nparticularising; but we should think that no one in his sober senses\r\nwill dispute the evident fact that such newspaper proprietors as took\r\ndouble pay from men because they knew they were assisting them in\r\nrobbery, were morally far and away more guilty than the robbers\r\nthemselves. If any apology is needed for our going so far into the\r\nbetting subject, it will be found in the almost total ignorance, as well\r\nas the blind prejudice, which is every day manifested about the\r\ndifference between the commission agents and their greatest enemies, the\r\nadvertising welchers.\r\n\r\nThe raid which drove the bookmakers from London to the principal towns\r\nin Scotland seems almost to have been organised by the authorities in\r\nthe interest of the scamps of the betting world. It certainly was\r\nconsiderably to the latter’s advantage. In the hurry and turmoil which\r\neventuated from the hegira, it was hard for people who were not experts\r\nto tell the good men from the bad; and as, the more unfounded a man’s\r\npretensions, the greater were his promises, letters containing\r\nremittances almost swarmed into the offices least worthy of confidence.\r\nOne good, however, resulted from this. The conversion of sinners we have\r\nthe best authority for regarding as a blessing, and it must be admitted\r\nthat owing to the manner in which money poured in upon them, and one or\r\ntwo subsequent bits of luck in the way of unbacked horses’ victories,\r\nmen who went to Glasgow and Edinburgh as adventurers, if not as actual\r\nthieves, remained to become not only solvent, but strictly virtuous. It\r\nwas not, however, until affairs had somewhat settled down in the North,\r\nuntil Scotland began to be regarded as the permanent abode of the layer\r\nof odds, that advertisements which on the face of them were gigantic\r\nswindles appeared. Hitherto the attempts of impostors had been confined\r\nto a semblance of really fair and legitimate business, the firm being\r\nexistent as long as there was nothing to pay, and _non est_ immediately\r\nthe blow came. And people who imagine that a bookmaker has nothing to do\r\nbut take money, would respect him rather more than they do now if after\r\none or two big races they could see his account, and note the scrupulous\r\nmanner in which every debt is paid, if he bids for respectability in his\r\nvocation. A delay of a day in his settlement would lead to unpleasant\r\nresults, for the very contiguity of the thieves makes the honest men\r\nmore exact in their transactions. So it is usual, when a man has money\r\nto receive by post from a commission agent, for him to get it at once,\r\nor most likely not at all. The tipstering and touting fraternities had,\r\nwhile the headquarters of advertising turfites remained in London, been\r\nsatisfied with short paragraphs intimating their absolute knowledge of\r\nthe future, and their willingness to communicate such knowledge to the\r\nBritish public for a consideration in the way of stamps, or a percentage\r\non winnings. But when once ready money had been tasted, it seemed to act\r\non these people as blood is said to on tigers, and they determined to\r\nhave more at all risks. It was useless to try for it a year or so after\r\nthe migration by applications couched in the ordinary style, for the run\r\nof business was by that time divided among certain firms, and the old\r\nslow way of giving advice for shillings and sixpences was abhorrent to\r\nminds that soared after bank-notes and post-office orders; besides, it\r\nhad very nearly worn itself out. Fresh moves were therefore necessary,\r\nand they were made in various ways, each of which was more or less\r\nsuccessful. The most important of them all, and the one with which we\r\nhave to do now, was the discretionary-investment dodge, which was for a\r\ntime a complete success, and which would have lasted much longer than it\r\ndid, had it not been for the faculty of imitation possessed by thieves\r\nother than those who inaugurated the venture. Imitation may be the\r\nsincerest form of flattery, but even flattery must be painful when it is\r\ndestructive, and Messrs Balliee & Walter could doubtless have dispensed\r\nwith the crowds who followed in their wake, and almost made the fortunes\r\nof all papers who would take their advertisements. We are not aware\r\nwhether the system was invented by Balliee & Walter, either or both;\r\nbut, anyhow, they were its first promoters to any extent, and became\r\nthoroughly identified with it. Rumour states that Balliee was a kind of\r\nMrs Harris, and that Walter was the firm. This is nothing to us, though,\r\nhowever much it may be to those who were despoiled of their cash by the\r\ndiscretionary swindle. The advertisements put forth for the benefit of\r\nthose willing to trust their money blindly into the hands of men of whom\r\nthey knew nothing must have been very successful, for it is admitted\r\nthat the letters received in Glasgow for Balliee & Walter were so\r\nenormous in quantity that special arrangements had often to be made for\r\ntheir delivery. It is noticeable that swindlers of this description\r\nalways assume that their firm is not only long established but well\r\nknown, and the following, taken from the first page of the _Sporting\r\nLife_ of the Derby-day 1871, will show that the particular people in\r\nquestion had no scruple about inventing facts for the purpose of\r\nsubstantiating their arguments:--\r\n\r\n  THE KINGSCLERE LONDON AND GLASGOW TURF\r\n  COMMISSION AGENCY.\r\n\r\n  Messrs.

BALLIEE and WALTER will continue their highly successful\r\n  system of DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS at the\r\n\r\n  EPSOM MEETING,\r\n\r\n  where they personally attend, and as such a great influx of business\r\n  is expected during the Derby Week, they have engaged three extra\r\n  Commissioners to assist them in carrying out the system, and again are\r\n  sanguine of realising a gold-achieving victory.\r\n\r\n  AT EPSOM MEETING LAST SUMMER, SEASON 1870,\r\n\r\n  Each £25 investor was returned £703 nett Winnings, in addition to\r\n  stake deposited.\r\n\r\n  Each investor of £20 in 1868 realised £487.\r\n        „          £25 „  1869    „     £324 15s.\r\n        „          £50 „  1870    „     £1,406.\r\n\r\n  The above sums were paid to each investor of the specified amounts,\r\n  and this season we with confidence assert that the investments will be\r\n  more remunerative to the investor.\r\n\r\n  The Oaks this season will be won by, comparatively speaking, an\r\n  outsider. Last season’s subscribers will remember our warning them\r\n  against Hester, and we assure our readers that Hannah will, like all\r\n  the Baron’s favourites, be doomed to defeat. A clever Northern\r\n  division have a filly the beau ideal of Blink Bonny, as being tried a\r\n  7℔ better animal than Bothwell, and with health must win the fillies’\r\n  race in a canter. The owner most unfortunately omitted to enter her\r\n  for the Two Thousand and Derby, or we should have seen her credited\r\n  with the first-named event, and first favourite for Blue Riband\r\n  honours.\r\n\r\n  SEVERAL RODS ARE IN PICKLE\r\n\r\n  for the minor events. Particulars were given in our last week’s\r\n  Circular (May 12), and even at this distant period we are enabled to\r\n  predict the success of six certain winners.\r\n\r\n  HAVING HORSES OF OUR OWN,\r\n\r\n  and others identical with our interests, running at this meeting,\r\n  coupled with the important commissions we have the working of at\r\n  EPSOM.\r\n\r\n  Our knowledge of market movements, the intimate terms we are on with\r\n  the various owners, jockeys, and trainers, our social position with\r\n  the élite of the racing world, enables us to ascertain the intentions\r\n  of other owners and the chances their respective candidates\r\n  possess--information far beyond the reach of other advertisers.\r\n\r\nThis is by no means all; we merely pause to take breath and recover\r\nself-possession, after a steady perusal of Mr Walter’s benefactions. It\r\nis noticeable that the standard of verse employed by these\r\nphilanthropists is about on a par with their standard of morality. It\r\nseems wonderful that any sane person should believe in the existence of\r\na certain guide to the winning-post, and the idea that, if there had\r\nbeen such a thing, Messrs Balliee & Walter would have assuredly used it\r\nfor themselves alone, never seems to have entered into the heads of\r\ntheir victims, at all events until too late. After the vaunt about\r\nposition and information, the intimates of “the _élite_ of the racing\r\nworld” go on:--\r\n\r\n  MESSRS. BALLIEE and WALTER, alone of all firms that undertake\r\n  Discretionary Investments, are to be seen personally in the Ring, and\r\n  they wish to draw the attention of Turf speculators to the fact that\r\n  NO OTHER ADVERTISERS ARE OWNERS OF HORSES, despite what they may say\r\n  to the contrary. If their systems equalled ours, would they not accept\r\n  the challenge given by us for the past twelve months in the various\r\n  sporting papers? Vide commencement of advertisement.\r\n\r\n  So sanguine are we of success at Epsom, the innumerable and peculiar\r\n  advantages presented, and every facility being offered for the\r\n  successful working of our\r\n\r\n  DISCRETIONARY METHOD,\r\n  that we are enabled to\r\n  GUARANTEE AGAINST LOSS,\r\n  and assert with confidence that\r\n  WINNING IS REDUCED TO AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY.\r\n\r\n  DEPOSIT REQUIRED FOR DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS AT THE\r\n  EPSOM SUMMER MEETING:--\r\n  £500, £100, £50, £25, £10, or £5.\r\n\r\n  By investing in accordance with this infallible method of backing our\r\n  final selections at the post, loss is simply an impossibility, and\r\n  guaranteed against,\r\n\r\n  WINNING BEING REDUCED TO AN ABSOLUTE\r\n  CERTAINTY.\r\n\r\n  This often-repeated assertion (and not once contradicted for the past\r\n  five years), and the winnings realised weekly for subscribers who\r\n  patronise this system, is sufficient to prove its intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n  This is just the sort and class of meeting for gentlemen of capital\r\n  and systematic investors to invest a £500 or £1,000 bank, being indeed\r\n  a golden opportunity that all should embrace. The fact of our\r\n  guaranteeing\r\n\r\n  A WIN EQUAL TO OUR SUCCESS OF LAST SUMMER,\r\n  and, as previously stated,\r\n  GUARANTEE TO HOLD THE INVESTOR AGAINST LOSS OF EVEN A\r\n  FRACTIONAL PART OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED,\r\n\r\n  should be sufficient to convince gentlemen of the true character and\r\n  value of this infallible method of backing our final selections at the\r\n  post.\r\n\r\n  CAN ANY SYSTEM BE SO LUCRATIVE TO THE\r\n  INVESTOR?\r\n\r\n  Our position as owners of horses and proprietors of “THE KINGSCLERE\r\n  RACING CIRCULAR,” the most successful medium of all Turf advices, and\r\n  has treble the circulation of any other circular published; the\r\n  flattering encomiums passed on our “Infallible Method” by the Sporting\r\n  Press of the United Kingdom, and being recommended by them as\r\n\r\n  “The only recognised method by which backers of horses can win\r\n  large sums at all the principal meetings;”\r\n\r\n  coupled with our position as the most influential Commission Agents\r\n  both in the London and Manchester Markets, ensure gentlemen entrusting\r\n  us with Discretionary Investments being fairly and honestly dealt\r\n  with, and the successes that we promise and achieve meeting after\r\n  meeting in the columns of this and other papers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  FACTS ARE STUBBORN THINGS.\r\n\r\n  The following average results speak volumes in favour of this\r\n  method:--\r\n\r\n  The following successes have been achieved this season by\r\n\r\n  THE KINGSCLERE RACING CIRCULAR’S\r\n  INFALLIBLE METHOD\r\n  OF\r\n  DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS.\r\n\r\n  Each £25 investor at Enfield received nett winnings value £200.\r\n\r\n  Each £10 investor at Lichfield was remitted by Thursday’s post (April\r\n  13) £82 10s., being winnings and stake included, after the 5 per cent.\r\n  commission had been deducted.\r\n\r\n  Each investor of a £10 stake at the Lincoln Meeting received nett\r\n  winnings of £180 10s. by Tuesday’s post, March 28.\r\n\r\n  Each investor at Liverpool in accordance with this system, on two\r\n  investments, viz.,\r\n\r\n  THE LAMB         Win,\r\n  SCARRINGTON      A place,\r\n\r\n  realised £75 with each £10 invested.\r\n\r\n  A £10 stake realised £200 nett winnings at the Burton (Lincoln)\r\n  Meeting.\r\n\r\n  A £25 stake invested on Waterloo Cup realised £300,\r\n\r\n  MASTER MCGRATH\r\n\r\n  being selected right throughout the piece, and again in finals with\r\n  Pretender.\r\n\r\n  A £10 stake realised at the Cambridgeshire Meeting the sum of £240\r\n  nett winnings.\r\n\r\n  A £5 stake at the West Drayton Meeting realised £30 nett winnings.\r\n\r\n  Bromley and several other meetings were also highly successful.\r\n\r\n  At Croxton Park each £10 invested realised £102 nett.\r\n\r\n  Each £25 invested at Thirsk realised £150.\r\n\r\n  THE ABOVE AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN PAID THIS SEASON TO ALL PATRONS WHO\r\n  ENTRUSTED US WITH DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS OVER THESE MEETINGS, again\r\n  proving the value of this method over all others advertised.\r\n\r\n  The past augurs well for the future, as the above successes testify.\r\n  We personally attend EPSOM, and are always successful at this meeting.\r\n\r\n  A LOSS HAS NEVER OCCURRED TO FOLLOWERS OF OUR SYSTEM, and this season\r\n  we are even more than ever confident of success.\r\n\r\n  Cash reaching us on Thursday will be in time for two days’\r\n  investments; and cash arriving by Friday’s first post will be invested\r\n  on Oaks winner and the last day of the meeting.\r\n\r\n  Five per cent. deducted from all winnings.\r\n\r\n  THE LARGER THE STAKE, THE GREATER SCOPE IS AVAILABLE\r\n  FOR LUCRATIVE SPECULATION.\r\n  LOSS OF STAKE IS IN ALL CASES GUARANTEED AGAINST.\r\n\r\n  The opulent winnings realised weekly throughout the season cannot fail\r\n  to convince systematic speculators that this system is the par\r\n  excellence of all methods for winning large sums at each and every\r\n  important race-gathering.\r\n\r\n  Winnings and account of investments will be forwarded on Monday, May\r\n  29.\r\n\r\n  Investors can have their winnings (less 5 per cent.) remitted by open\r\n  cheque or bank notes, as preferred, by signifying their wishes on that\r\n  point when remitting cash for investment.\r\n\r\n  One trial is sufficient to prove to the most sceptical the value of\r\n  this method over all others advertised. Gentlemen who have lost their\r\n  money in the so-called winning modus swindles, or through following\r\n  their own fancies, advice of puffing tipsters, newspaper selections,\r\n  backing first favourites, jockeys’ mounts, or any other system, should\r\n  give our infallible method a trial at the Epsom Meeting. Cash should\r\n  be forwarded to reach us on or before Tuesday, addressed to Mr W. H.\r\n  WALTER, 62 Jamaica-street, Glasgow. If after that date, address\r\n  letters, &c., &c., W. H.

Terms:--Season, 21s.--Address orders and letters, W.\r\n  H. WALTER (of Kingsclere), Ravenscourt Park, Hammersmith, London, W.\r\n\r\n  In thanking our Derby subscribers for their past support, we\r\n  respectfully solicit a continuance of their favours on the above\r\n  terms.\r\n\r\n  The Private Telegraphic Key Book will be issued to Season Subscribers\r\n  only in the course of a few days. Those that intend renewing their\r\n  subscriptions should do so at once.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that this advertisement was intended to obtain\r\none large haul before the business was abandoned. With little alteration\r\nit ran for a very considerable time in many papers, and the expenses of\r\nadvertising alone must have been enormous. For it is not to be expected\r\nthat any blind credulity exhibited itself in the various publishing\r\noffices, and hard cash, and plenty of it, had to be expended before a\r\nline of Balliee & Walter’s was allowed to appear. It will be seen by\r\nwhat we have quoted that winnings and accounts of investments are\r\npromised on Monday, and in true business-like style every depositor\r\nreceived his envelope. With what feverish anxiety many must have torn\r\nopen the enclosure! So many men, so many minds, says the proverb, and\r\nthe ways of expressing wrath must have been various indeed. We are,\r\nhowever, not in a position to furnish any particulars as to how the news\r\nwas received, it is enough to know what the information was. And, as may\r\nbe guessed, it was not satisfactory. The circulars were always neatly\r\nconstructed, and set forth with a regret that owing to a combination of\r\nuntoward circumstances the hopes of the chief investor, “the man at the\r\npost,” had been dashed, and for that week--always the first week of such\r\nan occurrence--matters had resulted disastrously. Then would follow a\r\nstatement of account, in which it was shown that investments had been\r\nfortunate at the outset, that then they had changed, and that by placing\r\ntoo much money on an apparent certainty, so as to recover the losings,\r\nthe whole bulk of the bank had departed, never to return. The sums\r\nreceived by Messrs Balliee & Walter were of course various, and\r\naccording to the amount, so was the table arranged; but there was a\r\ngreat family likeness about them all, the principle being to show that\r\nthe horses, when they did not win, were very close up, and so seconds,\r\nwith now and again a third, were nearly always chosen! Thus one £10\r\nstake for the Derby week of 1871--the week in which the advertisement\r\ngiven appears--was accounted for thus:--\r\n\r\n  Epsom, Tuesday, May 23.                      Won.         Lost.\r\n\r\n  Trial Stakes, Manille,                        --        £0 10  0\r\n  Horton Stakes, Trident,                       --         1  0  0\r\n  Maiden Plate, Queen Bee,                      --         2  0  0\r\n  Rous Stakes, Banderolle,                      --         0 10  0\r\n  Woodcote Stakes, Cremorne (11 to 8 on),    £0 14  6        --\r\n\r\n  Wednesday.\r\n\r\n  Bentinck Plate, Lady Atholstone,              --         0 10  0\r\n  Derby, King of the Forest,                    --         1  0  0\r\n  Stanley Stakes, Hamilton,                     --         2  0  0\r\n  Match, Lizzie Cowl (5 to 4 on),             0  8  0        --\r\n  Manor Stakes, Holdenby,                       --         0 10  0\r\n  Town Plate, Banderolle,                       --         1  0  0\r\n\r\n  Thursday.\r\n\r\n  Glasgow Plate, Countryman (2 to 1 on),      0  5  0       --\r\n  High Level Handicap, Free Trade,              --        0 10  0\r\n  Two-year-old Stakes, Clotilde filly,          --        1  0  0\r\n  Tadworth Stakes, Manna,                       --        2  0  0\r\n\r\n                                             £1  7  6   £12 10  0\r\n\r\nWith five per cent. commission charged on the winnings, this left a\r\nbalance £1, 3s. 9½d. due to Messrs Balliee & Walter, which it was hoped\r\nwould be at once remitted. This was cruel, but crueller still was the\r\nstatement, that had the stake been larger, affairs would have arranged\r\nthemselves satisfactorily, as a great change took place at the close of\r\nThursday and on Friday, and those whose banks lasted over the first run\r\nof ill-luck left off winners of large sums. With the demand for payment\r\nof balance came a request which, from its very coolness, must have\r\nstaggered those who, being once victimised, could see through the\r\nswindle, though in very many instances--as if in corroboration of Mr\r\nCarlyle’s theory--it was complied with. This was a desire for a fresh\r\ntrial, and positive security from loss was guaranteed. It is noticeable\r\nin the table given that by a judicious selection of races and horses the\r\nwinnings were bound to be always low, as animals with odds on are\r\nselected, and that when stakes are lowest. When on the doubling\r\nprinciple the stake on the chosen winner would be inconveniently large a\r\nrace was omitted. The returns made were necessarily various, but that\r\ngiven is an accurate representative of the system.\r\n\r\nBalliee & Walter continued to flourish for a long time; but whether it\r\nwas that they became individually greedy, whether newspaper proprietors\r\nbecame exorbitant in their demands on the spoil, or whether rivalry\r\naffected them, we know not, all we do know is that they committed a most\r\nopenly outrageous act on a race-course, and the bubble at once burst. It\r\nmay seem strange that anything discretionary-investment agents, who had\r\nbeen gradually becoming a byword and a reproach, could do would affect\r\ntheir position; but our duty is to record the fact, and not to allow it\r\nto be disputed on any theoretic grounds. If they had calmly continued to\r\nmerely swindle, they might have advertised till now; but they outraged\r\nthe sanctity of the British race-course, and were damned for all time,\r\nif not to all eternity. They had become possessed by some means or other\r\nof a hurdle-racer called Goodfellow, and two or three weeks before one\r\nof the suburban gate-money meetings they made a match for him to run a\r\nrace at it against a very moderate mare. Immediately this was done they\r\ncircularised all customers, telling them to be sure and back Goodfellow,\r\nas he could not possibly lose, and stating that on account of very heavy\r\ninvestments already made, they could afford, as a favour to their\r\nclients, to return them double the odds which would be laid against\r\nGoodfellow on the day. In the _Kingsclere Racing Circular_, a weekly\r\npamphlet issued by these honourable gentlemen, we find under date March\r\n10, 1871, the following ingenious application. This, it has been since\r\nproved, brought heavy sums to the Ravenscourt Park exchequer, whence it\r\nwas not allowed to depart, Messrs Balliee & Walter, like true and\r\nlegitimate bookmakers, preferring to lay the 6 to 4’s against their own\r\nhorse themselves, rather than that their patrons should be\r\ninconvenienced by having to take shorter prices from others:--\r\n\r\n  CROYDON SPECIAL INVESTMENT.\r\n\r\n  The match--Goodfellow v. Harriett--will come off at Croydon on Tuesday\r\n  next. It is simply a matter of putting the coin down and picking it up\r\n  again. It is any odds on our horse, and as we wish our Subscribers to\r\n  participate in this certainty, we will undertake to obtain for them 6\r\n  to 4 for all cash sent, which must reach Mr Walter, Ravenscourt Park,\r\n  if possible by Monday evening, and not later than Tuesday’s first\r\n  post. Gibson is sure to back Harriett for a 1000, and probably bring\r\n  her favourite. The sole reason of us wishing Subscribers to allow us\r\n  to invest for them, is to prevent them rushing on and spoiling the\r\n  market, which will be to their interest as well as our own. We have\r\n  engaged one of the cleverest cross country riders of the day to ride\r\n  Goodfellow, and our horse never was so fit and well as at the present\r\n  time. Daniels will have the mount of Harriett. Such a chance may not\r\n  occur again throughout the season. Investors should speculate a £50 or\r\n  £100 Bank. We cannot undertake to invest more than £300 for any one of\r\n  our patrons.\r\n\r\nBy this means Balliee & Walter obtained from their purblind dupes a\r\nlarge amount of money with which to back Goodfellow, and of this they of\r\ncourse placed as much as they could upon Harriett, the opposing\r\ncandidate. In the race, if race so iniquitous a transaction can be\r\ncalled, the discretionary-investment horse was, as might have been\r\nexpected, “pulled,” so that Balliee & Walter had all the money they\r\nreceived to the good, besides what they won from the unsuspecting by\r\nbacking the animal they had pretended to oppose. This led to their\r\ngradually disappearing from the front pages of the newspapers, though\r\nthey continued their business under an _alias_ very successfully. Walter\r\nwas eventually fined a hundred pounds at one of the metropolitan courts,\r\nunder the Betting-House Act, 1853, for having carried on a part of his\r\nbusiness at Hammersmith. It seems rather ludicrous that a man should\r\nhave been fined for what he in reality never did. But lawyers and\r\nmagistrates could not distinguish the difference between betting and\r\nonly pretending to bet, so they fined Mr Walter just as they would have\r\ndone if he had been a really honourable man, and had therefore deserved\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nFrom the discretionary-investment class of turf-swindler we will now\r\npass on to another, quite as ingenious and very often as dangerous. A\r\nfew years back, when opportunity served--that is, when the honest layer\r\nof odds was harassed by the police and driven from London, and when good\r\nmen and bad were almost irremediably mixed up--a sharp rogue hit upon an\r\nidea for making the tipstering and private-advice business a means to\r\nquite a new phase of imposition. This was known among those who profited\r\nby it as “forcing the voucher,” and a very pretty little game it was\r\nwhile it lasted, though the profits of pioneers were of course\r\nconsiderably diminished as soon as ever the secret got wind, by the\r\nimitative faculty to which reference has been already made. Commencing,\r\nas usual, with small advertisements and large profits, forcers in time\r\nfound themselves, by stress of competition, obliged to spend a good\r\nshare of their hard earnings in specially-tempting invitations to those\r\nwho would go any but the right way towards being wealthy; or else to\r\nseek other courses. So in 1872 we find three or four firms occupying a\r\nlarge share of the papers, and giving forth promises without stint.\r\nWhether the original forcer was in any of these partnerships it is\r\nimpossible to tell, as the names were, as a rule, fictitious, and often\r\nchanged; but whether or not, it is certain that those who advertised\r\nheaviest drove all small thieves from the field, and so, two years back,\r\nthe business, as far as we are concerned, was carried on chiefly by\r\nAdkins & Wood, Robert Danby & Co., Marshall & Grant, and James Rawlings\r\n& Co., who advertised quite separately, but whose notifications might\r\nvery easily have been the work of one pen. We will therefore take\r\nRawlings & Co. to represent the fraternity, and in their advertisement\r\nwhich appeared at the end of April 1872 will be found the peculiarities\r\nof all the others. This is it:--\r\n\r\n  DIGBY GRAND sent to every season subscriber, and for a place at\r\n  6 to 1, to every reader of\r\n  THE PREMIER RACING CIRCULAR.\r\n\r\n  Proprietors,\r\n  JAMES RAWLINGS and Co.,\r\n  65, YORK PLACE,\r\n  EDINBURGH.\r\n\r\n  Published by the Proprietors every Saturday, at their chief office, 65\r\n  York Place, Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n  THE PREMIER RACING CIRCULAR still maintains its well-merited\r\n  reputation as the only infallible and unerringly-successful winning\r\n  guide, by the aid of which private backers can and do, week by week,\r\n  realise hundreds of pounds with perfect safety over the principal\r\n  races throughout the kingdom. The uninterrupted series of successes\r\n  which have attended its vaticinations during past seasons have been\r\n  gloriously crowned by the success of every special investment advised\r\n  in its pages this season, as will be seen by the following list of\r\n  winners already given:--\r\n\r\n                                                        Price at which\r\n                                                         clients were\r\n        Race.

Promptitude, despatch, exactitude, and\r\n  liberality, as in the past, will ever be our watchwords in the future.\r\n\r\n  Every reader of “The Sporting Life” is earnestly invited to send at\r\n  once for this week’s number, as the information therein contained will\r\n  enable everyone to win a little fortune over that splendid and highly\r\n  lucrative mode of investment--\r\n\r\n  A DOUBLE EVENT\r\n  That cannot be upset.\r\n  The positive Winners of\r\n  THE TWO THOUSAND\r\n  and\r\n  ONE THOUSAND GUINEAS.\r\n\r\n  It is rarely that we advise this method of investing, but when we have\r\n  sent out to our clients a double event it has never failed to come\r\n  off. Last year we advised a double event for these races--\r\n\r\n  Two Thousand      Bothwell      Won\r\n  One Thousand      Hannah        Won\r\n\r\n  And this year both our selections are, if possible, greater and more\r\n  undeniable certainties.\r\n\r\n  THE TWO THOUSAND GUINEAS.\r\n\r\n  Of all the good things that in the course of a long and varied\r\n  experience on the Turf it has ever been our good fortune to be\r\n  possessed of, we cannot recall a single occasion on which every\r\n  attendant circumstance combined so surely to render, as in the present\r\n  instance, the race such an absolute foregone conclusion for our\r\n  selection. The trial which took place this week was unprecedented in\r\n  its severity, and, to the surprise of owner and trainer, the animal\r\n  performed so far beyond their most sanguine expectations or hopes as\r\n  to show them that success is reduced to the greatest moral certainty\r\n  ever known in the history of the English Turf. This is an opportunity\r\n  similar to those that have made the fortunes of many of our most\r\n  wealthy speculators, for whom, as in the present instance, victory is\r\n  a foregone conclusion and defeat a moral impossibility. Everyone\r\n  should seize the opportunity of reaping the rich harvest of golden\r\n  fruit that awaits the bold speculator of foregone conclusions like\r\n  this.\r\n\r\n  THE ONE THOUSAND GUINEAS.\r\n\r\n  It is to us an easy task to select the winner of this race, as the\r\n  immense superiority she enjoys over every other animal engaged (known\r\n  only to owner, trainer, and ourselves) is so vast that this race will\r\n  be little more than an exercise canter for this speedy filly. So\r\n  quietly has this good thing been nursed by the shrewd division to\r\n  which the mare belongs, that a real good price is now to be had,\r\n  though when this superb specimen of an English thoroughbred is seen at\r\n  the post, we are confident that even money will be eagerly snapped up\r\n  by those who till then neglect to back her.\r\n\r\n  THE DOUBLE EVENT,\r\n\r\n  as stated above, is as sure to come off as these lines are in print.\r\n  Send then at once for this week’s number, and do not delay an hour if\r\n  you wish to land a fortune over these two genuine certainties.\r\n\r\n  We could wish no better opportunity to display the genuine good things\r\n  sent out by the “Premier Racing Circular” than these two races\r\n  present, and we beg that everyone will at once send six stamps and\r\n  stamped addressed envelope for this week’s number, and stand these\r\n  morals to win them a fortune.\r\n\r\n  Address--\r\n\r\n  JAMES RAWLINGS and Co.,\r\n  65, YORK PLACE,\r\n  EDINBURGH.\r\n\r\nIf we were not certain that these men got large sums of money from\r\nwilling victims, it would seem almost impossible that people could be\r\nfound credulous enough to believe that absolute certainty could be\r\nsecured on the turf. Certainty of losing is naturally much easier than\r\ncertainty of winning, and yet even loss cannot be reduced to less than\r\nimminent probability so long as a horse goes to the post unphysicked,\r\nand the jockey is not allowed to openly pull him. And so, though no one\r\nwill attempt to defend Messrs Rawlings & Co., their dupes deserve but\r\nthe smallest amount of pity; for even the most foolish of them must have\r\nknown that certainty of winning to them must have meant certainty of\r\nlosing to the other side, and that therefore, even if the contract had\r\nbeen carried out, somebody must have been swindled. If it were not for\r\nthe greed and avarice which mainly direct the actions of those who are\r\ngenerally known as fools, magsmen, sharpers, discretionary-investment\r\ncommissioners, and voucher-forcers would have to take to honest\r\nemployment. This may seem a truism, yet when a skittle-sharper or\r\n“street-mugger” is tried in a police court, and convicted for having\r\nvictimised a “flat,” it never seems to strike the magistrate or the\r\ngeneral public that the prisoner simply swindled a man who had all the\r\nwill but not the ability to swindle him. And there can be no reasonable\r\ndoubt--we should much like to see the matter tried--that the principal\r\nsupports of rogues are the most grasping, selfish, and hard-hearted of\r\nmortals, and not at all the soft, good-natured bumpkins that they are\r\ngenerally depicted. We should not like to trust to either the honour or\r\nthe honesty of any man who had been concerned even as a victim in one of\r\nthe transactions which now and again appear in the police reports; and\r\nif we had any sympathy, which is not very likely, to bestow on either\r\nside, it would certainly be given to the man who gets sent to prison.\r\n\r\nRawlings & Co. seem to have managed the spring campaign of 1872 very\r\nsuccessfully, for while other members of the same brotherhood had to\r\ndrop out of the papers or to appear in new guise after April, we find\r\nour heroes still merrily addressing the public from the front page of\r\nthe sporting papers of June 8, and as able to guarantee freedom from\r\nloss as ever. And though it may not seem long from the end to April to\r\nthis early part of June, it must be recollected that within that space\r\nseveral very important meetings are held, and that dismal gaps are\r\nfound in the ranks of both “wrong” and “right” men after a Derby,\r\nespecially after such a Derby as Cremorne’s, which found out the weak\r\nspots in a good many big books, and altered the prospects of many a\r\nturfite, professional and amateur. So finding Rawlings so well through,\r\nwe were tempted at the time to communicate with him, and discover the\r\nprinciple upon which he “forced the voucher.” Here is his advertisement\r\nof June 8, in which he glories in past triumphs and feels confident of\r\nfuture successes:--\r\n\r\n  CREMORNE, QUEEN’S MESSENGER, AND REINE.\r\n\r\n  JAMES RAWLINGS and Co., the oldest established Turf advisers in Great\r\n  Britain; proprietors of\r\n\r\n  THE PREMIER RACING CIRCULAR,\r\n\r\n  the most successful winning guide extant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  THE PREMIER RACING CIRCULAR, selected Cremorne\r\n  and Reine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  THE PREMIER RACING CIRCULAR of this day contains\r\n  three certainties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  THE PREMIER RACING CIRCULAR’S selections pulled off the double event\r\n  for the Derby and Oaks, likewise Queen’s Messenger for a place at 4 to\r\n  1.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  THE PREMIER RACING CIRCULAR has this season selected each and every\r\n  important winner, as may be seen by referring to back numbers of this\r\n  publication, invaluable alike to large and small speculators. The\r\n  proprietors beg respectfully to draw the attention of that section of\r\n  the public who have neglected to take advantage of the opportunities\r\n  that they have, for the past three months, weekly drawn attention to\r\n  in the columns of this and other journals, that this week’s number of\r\n  the Premier Racing Circular will contain three of the greatest morals\r\n  and most undeniable certainties ever known in this or any other era of\r\n  the Turf’s history, namely, the winner of\r\n\r\n  THE ASCOT STAKES,\r\n\r\n  a real good thing, at a real good price. Over this race any gentleman\r\n  may safely invest as heavily as he may think fit, as we know that our\r\n  selection cannot be beaten; the course is peculiarly adapted to the\r\n  animal’s action, and the stable have satisfied themselves, past\r\n  question or doubt, that he possesses both speed and stamina to land\r\n  this event with the utmost ease.\r\n\r\n  THE ROYAL HUNT CUP\r\n\r\n  is equally a certainty for a veritable flyer, whose merits have\r\n  hitherto been so cleverly concealed by the owner, that the handicapper\r\n  has no idea of his sterling excellence. He is undergoing a special\r\n  preparation for this race, the best light-weight in the world will be\r\n  in the saddle, and a long price is now to be had.\r\n\r\n  THE NORTHUMBERLAND PLATE.\r\n\r\n  We have never yet missed selecting the winner of this race, and as the\r\n  cleverest division on the Turf, as to whose movements we are always au\r\n  fait, have specially laid themselves out to secure this prize, the\r\n  public may rely upon it that, as in past years, we shall again select\r\n  the winner.\r\n\r\n  This week’s number contains full particulars of these undeniable and\r\n  gold-producing morals, in addition to a mass of other information\r\n  invaluable to backers. No one should invest a shilling on any one of\r\n  the above races without first forwarding us six stamps and stamped\r\n  directed envelope for this week’s issue.\r\n\r\n  Address--\r\n\r\n  JAMES RAWLINGS and Co.,\r\n  65, YORK PLACE,\r\n  EDINBURGH.\r\n\r\nSix stamps and a stamped directed envelope were accordingly sent, and in\r\nreturn we received a copy of the _Premier Racing Circular_, dated June\r\n6, which was full of congratulations, and which promised far more than\r\neven the advertisements did. One paragraph in it was specially worthy of\r\nattention. It ran thus: “_We have several commissions still unsettled\r\nover the Derby and Oaks. Gentlemen holding winning vouchers will please\r\nsend them in at once._” What could be more fair, honourable, and\r\nstraightforward than this; and who would think of suspecting Rawlings of\r\nunfair dealing? Yet, at the very time the invitation we have quoted\r\nappeared, the people who sent in their winning vouchers received in\r\nreturn, not money, but the following circular, which we reprint exactly,\r\nand which, with the alteration of the signature and the name of the\r\nmeeting, will do for any firm and any week’s racing the reader may\r\nchoose. This is one of a lot we have collected at times from many\r\nvictims:--\r\n\r\n  65 YORK PLACE, EDINBURGH.\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\n  We regret to inform you that, in consequence of some of our important\r\n  Accounts not having been settled at Epsom this week, we must\r\n  unavoidably postpone the settlement. This is the first time that such\r\n  an unpleasantness has occurred, but we can assure you that we have\r\n  done all in our power in the matter. No one regrets this unfortunate\r\n  affair more than ourselves, after serving the public so faithfully for\r\n  such a number of years, and all we can do is to remit you immediately\r\n  we receive winnings from the temporarily embarrassed Commissioners.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile, We remain,\r\n\r\n  Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n  JAMES RAWLINGS & CO.\r\n\r\nThere is no boast in the statement, that when we received the _Premier\r\nRacing Circular_, we were pretty well acquainted with the manner in\r\nwhich Rawlings conducted his business--it would be a poor thing to boast\r\nabout--and so we turned to the envelope to look for the vouchers we knew\r\nwould be there. And there they were, enclosed in a piece of paper, on\r\nwhich was the information, that owing to the large sums they had\r\ninvested when the horses were at long shots, they could afford to return\r\nodds considerably over the current market; and winding up with a request\r\nthat intending backers would at once forward the amounts for which the\r\nvouchers were filled in, or any part of it which would suit them. Yes,\r\nthere they were, three in number, looking like cheques--the first, No.\r\n32,323, being for the Ascot Stakes, and bearing the bet of £200 to £10\r\nagainst Palmerston for the Ascot Stakes. The second was numbered 36,162,\r\nand said £300 to £10 Pitchfork for the Royal Hunt Cup; and the third was\r\n39,346, and was to the tune of £400 to £20 Minerve for the\r\nNorthumberland Plate. And this is the advice with regard to them, given\r\nin the _Circular_, without the alteration of even a letter:--\r\n\r\n  _THE PITCHFORK, PALMERSTON, AND MINERVE\r\n  COMMISSION_\r\n\r\n  We have been able to work the Commission (Pitchfork, Palmerston, and\r\n  Minerve), at an unusual liberal price, and we herewith offer for your\r\n  acceptance, as per enclosed vouchers, the very advantageous bets about\r\n  these absolute morals. Should you accept the whole (which we strongly\r\n  recommend), you will please forward stake money by return and retain\r\n  vouchers; if only a portion, return same, with stake money, and a\r\n  corrected voucher to amount of stake will be at once forwarded to you.\r\n  In the remote contingency of your not accepting any portion of either\r\n  bet, you will please return vouchers without a moment’s delay, that we\r\n  may have an opportunity of offering the bets to other clients.\r\n\r\n  Those who wish to back Pitchfork, Palmerston, and Minerve for a place,\r\n  can be on at one-fourth the odds, but to no greater amount than a £50\r\n  stake.\r\n\r\nThe secret of forcing the voucher, therefore, lay in the fact of\r\noffering far longer prices than could be obtained of any one who\r\nintended to pay when the races were over; for on June 6th, 1872, the day\r\non which the vouchers were drawn, the market prices, as quoted in the\r\npapers Mr Rawlings advertised in, were 10 to 1 against Palmerston for\r\nthe Ascot Stakes; 15 to 1 against Pitchfork for the Royal Hunt Cup; and\r\n10 to 1 against Minerve for the Northumberland Plate. Now as double the\r\nfair price is offered, and as the quoted market represents the odds\r\nwhich are laid at the chief clubs by the chief men, who can say that the\r\nvictims of Rawlings deserve pity? The ability of Rawlings & Co. as\r\ntipsters is strangely shown in this transaction. In their circular,\r\nPitchfork, Palmerston, and Minerve are their selections for the several\r\nraces, even to people who only accepted their advice and did not intrust\r\nthem with commissions. They assert that they have positive information\r\nthat these horses cannot lose. Under the head of “Royal Hunt Cup,” and\r\nperfectly independent of anything but the private-advice department,\r\nthey say, in reference to Pitchfork: “This is a ‘Woodyeates moral,’ and\r\nall must be on. Every now and then this influential coterie throws in\r\nfor a fortune, and when they do, the good thing invariably comes off.\r\nWe have never missed the winner of this race, and now, with all\r\nconfidence, we assure every client that no better opportunity could\r\npossibly occur of landing a rich and substantial stake. Some of our\r\nclients will neglect the opportunities we frequently lay before them;\r\nbut on this occasion as the price is so liberal, we do heartily hope\r\nthat one and all will go in for a rattling good stake.” Then about\r\nPalmerston for the Ascot Stakes, they tell us that “previous to the\r\ngreat Epsom event, Palmerston performed such a wonderful feat with the\r\nBrother to Flurry as to show the stable that the Ascot Stakes were\r\ncompletely at their mercy. Mr Payne and the owners who train at Fyfield\r\nlook upon defeat as impossible, and will stand their horses to win a\r\nvery large stake. We cannot recollect a more genuine investment, and\r\nmust urge all to stand this moral freely.” For the Northumberland Plate\r\nthey are, if anything, still more confident, their article on it\r\ncontaining this: “Another triumph awaits the French contingent in the\r\nNorthumberland Plate, as Minerve, own sister to Miss Hervine, is certain\r\nto carry off this event.” Rawlings’s prophecies might have turned out\r\nright if they had had a chance, but he does not seem to have possessed\r\neven a hint as to what would be started for the various stables, for not\r\none of the three selected ever saw the course on which victory was to be\r\nso easily obtained. What sorry rogues make fortunes nowadays! It is more\r\nthan likely that Rawlings, or whatever this trickster’s name was, like\r\nhis own selections on this particular occasion, had never seen a\r\nrace-course. Strange as this may seem, it is not at all improbable; for\r\nthere are lots of men who live by the turf, and who are as conversant\r\nwith pedigrees and performances of horses as can be, yet who know\r\nnothing beyond what they see on paper, and who, authorities on racing\r\nwhen in Fleet Street, would be quite nonplussed if taken to Newmarket\r\namong the horses whose names they know so well.\r\n\r\nWe trust we have now made plain the two greatest swindles in connection\r\nwith the turf, and at the same time shown the unworthiness of even the\r\npretence to knowledge made by them. But we have no wish that readers,\r\nforgetting the scamps with whom we set out, shall conclude this chapter\r\nwith the impression that there are no thieves so bad as sporting\r\nthieves, and so we will fall back on some swindling advertisements of\r\nthe general kind, from the general papers, which are not only as\r\nroguish, but as ignorant of the subjects selected as the effusions of\r\nRawlings himself. Here is one from the _Weekly Times_ of a couple of\r\nyears or so back:--\r\n\r\n  WONDERS OF THE HOROSCOPE.--Any person sending an addressed envelope,\r\n  age, height, colour of hair and eyes, together with 13 stamps, will\r\n  receive within 24 hours a correct likeness of their future husband or\r\n  wife, and date of marriage.--Address, A. WEMYSS, 2, Drake-street, Red\r\n  Lion-square, London.\r\n\r\nWe don’t mind giving Mr Wemyss--what an aristocratic name, by the\r\nway!--a gratuitous advertisement, though we hope that the first customer\r\nhe gets through our instrumentality will be the reverse of profitable.\r\nWemyss can do better still at a better price, as other advertisements\r\nshow. He is a milder form of rascal than Methralton, who makes offer as\r\nfollows in several of the weekly papers, and who is not content with his\r\neffect on the mind, but actually wishes to interfere with the matter:--\r\n\r\n  WONDROUS ARTS.--Your future revealed--Seven years, six stamps;\r\n  lifetime twelve stamps. State age. Love Charm, sixteen stamps.\r\n  Medicine for removing Gravel and Private diseases in a few days,\r\n  without injuring the constitution, sixty stamps. Methralton’s Bible\r\n  Key, twenty-six stamps. Book of Spirits, 408 pages, thirty-two stamps.\r\n  Millennial Prophecies, Gratis. METHRALTON, the Seer, Daventry.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of scoundrel, whose victims are like those of the\r\nhome-employment robbers, mostly poor helpless girls, and whose villany\r\nis far greater than that of the discreet Walter or the forcible\r\nRawlings, is the fellow who advertises constantly for actors and\r\nactresses, who may be perfectly inexperienced, but who are to get\r\nsalaried engagements through his influence. His form varies, but this is\r\none of his concoctions, and is from the _Daily Telegraph_:--\r\n\r\n  THE STAGE.--WANTED, TWELVE LADIES and GENTLEMEN (ages 16 to 40) for\r\n  salaried engagements. Totally inexperienced persons may\r\n  apply.--Communicate, by letter only, enclosing photograph and thirteen\r\n  stamps, Histrionicus ----.\r\n\r\nThis is either a swindle on the girls, or else on the members of the\r\nBritish public who pay their money to see acting. It is rumoured that\r\nnow and again women moving in a certain hemisphere give large sums for\r\nthe purpose of appearing on the stage. This may be, but we fancy the\r\nmanagers are quite shrewd enough not to let outsiders like the\r\nadvertiser, Histrionicus, interfere in such delicate matters. It might\r\nbe as well to ask why the “promotion in absentiâ” dodges are still\r\nallowed to parade themselves in the leading papers, or in fact why\r\npeople should be permitted to take upon themselves titles they have no\r\nright to. Possibly the matter is thought too ridiculous to call for\r\ninterference, but there are other qualities besides those of ridicule\r\nand contempt to be found in connection with the following, which is an\r\nadvertisement having no particularly distinctive features, and therefore\r\nwill represent the thousands of the same order that appear during the\r\nyear, and for payment of which a considerable number of spurious degrees\r\nmust be manufactured:--\r\n\r\n  PROMOTION IN ABSENTIÂ.--Qualified surgeons, chemists, dentists,\r\n  oculists, chiropodists, and professors of music or arts aspiring to a\r\n  doctor’s degree, may communicate by letter to Professor ----.\r\n\r\nQualified, forsooth! why, any one who liked to pay could obtain the most\r\nhonourable degree for the biggest idiot in Earlswood Asylum. One of the\r\nchief difficulties to be encountered over such a bad business as this is\r\nthat the good and the sham degree holders very often get irretrievably\r\nmixed up in certain phases of society. Physicians, surgeons, and\r\ngentlemen in similar position are protected, and so little dealing is\r\ndone in medical, surgical, or chemical degrees; but bachelors and\r\nmasters of arts and doctors of laws are made by the score, the\r\nrecipients of honours being in a majority of cases men whose ignorance\r\nmust be probed before it is appreciated, but whose depth requires no\r\ndelving whatever. Now, when a man of this kind elects to call himself\r\ndoctor, or puts B.A. or M.A. after his name, even those who know what\r\nlittle right he has to the degree are hardly quixotic enough to decline\r\ngiving him the title he covets; so in a year or so, Dr Brown or Dr Jones\r\nhas as firm a hold upon his title as if he had obtained it by a personal\r\nexamination under the most rigorous system; and strangers who are unable\r\nto discover for themselves the unworthiness of the pretender, give him\r\nall the honours which belong to the learned. Sometimes the applicant\r\nswindles the professor, and we not long back heard of an aspiring youth\r\nwho paid for the degrees of M.A. and LL.D. with a cheque and a bill,\r\neach being for £20, and both being dishonoured. It is a pity that these\r\ntwo scamps cannot be treated to three months in the House of Correction,\r\njust to encourage all other professors and practisers of small and\r\npaltry swindles.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another kind of rogue for whom we have room, who addresses\r\nhis victims by means of advertisements. This is the sorrowful Christian,\r\nwho makes the profession of religion his stock-in-trade, and finds it\r\nprofitable. Under the guise of sanctity there is hardly anything at\r\nwhich he will stick--he is the foulest and nastiest of all the foul and\r\nnasty birds who have supplied material for this chapter. He is as great\r\nan impostor in his pretences as any of the other swindlers are in\r\ntheirs, and so it would be just as fair to blame religion for the\r\nexistence of the sanctimonious scoundrel, or commerce for the\r\nhome-employment agent, as it is to blame racing for the welcher and the\r\nforcer. Here is a sample of the whining and despicable hound, compared\r\nwith whom, to our taste, the ordinary pickpocket is a gentleman:--\r\n\r\n  TO THE LORD’S PEOPLE.--A dear Christian tradesman, who about four\r\n  months ago drew from the Savings’ Bank £60, his all therein, to give\r\n  to a fellow Christian who urgently required that sum, “thus lending\r\n  and hoping for nothing again” but from a bountiful “God whose name is\r\n  Love,” is now in WANT OF FORTY POUNDS to pay all demands upon him, ere\r\n  he accepts a call to the ministry of the Everlasting Gospel, which he\r\n  believes his Heavenly Father is about to make known unto him. A lady,\r\n  his friend in Christ the Lord as revealed, in the power of God the\r\n  Holy Ghost, thus ventures in simple faith to try the door of\r\n  Providence in his behalf; and would leave the issue in the hands of\r\n  Him who has heart, hand, breath and purse of men at sovereign command.\r\n  The smallest help will be gratefully acknowledged by the Advertiser.\r\n  Address to ----.\r\n\r\nIf this is not blasphemy, what is it? Imagine the greasy smirk of\r\nsatisfaction with which the coin of the faithful was received and\r\ndivided between the dear Christian tradesman and his lady friend. There\r\nis something suspiciously jocular about the wind-up of the application;\r\nbut then, as an old proverb informs us, people who are doing well can\r\nafford the luxury of laughter. Another plan of the religious rascal is\r\nto answer applications for loans, and under the guise of philanthropy\r\nand Christianity to offer the required accommodation. By this means, and\r\nby the exhibition of certain forms, he obtains a deposit from the\r\nunfortunate would-be borrower, and decamps. This is, however, but a\r\nmeans of relaxation, and is simply indulged in at intervals, just to\r\nkeep the hand in while more important business is in course of\r\nprojection. The loan-office advertisements may to a certain extent be\r\nregarded as swindles, especially when they promise money without\r\nsecurity. Depend upon it, no professional money-lender is likely to let\r\nout his cash without security any more than without interest. Still\r\nloan-office advertisers are not swindlers absolutely, as they do lend\r\nmoney and to some extent perform their contracts. The papers at the\r\npresent time swarm with their advertisements, and the curious reader may\r\ninspect them as they appear, as for obvious reasons we must decline\r\nmaking a selection, which might be the reverse of judicious, more\r\nespecially as the notices do not come strictly within our limits. Now\r\nand again temporary offices are started, generally in poor\r\nneighbourhoods, for the purpose of bagging the inquiry fees, and with no\r\nintention whatever of lending money. Their general ultimatum is,\r\n“Security offered insufficient;” and a good story is told of a gentleman\r\nwho from motives of curiosity applied for a loan of £5, and gave as\r\nguarantors two of the most notoriously wealthy bankers of the City. In\r\ndue course he received the usual notification, that the security offered\r\nwas not sufficiently “responsible,” and that the accommodation could not\r\ntherefore be afforded.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the end of our list of swindlers and thieves; and if\r\nwe have succeeded in our endeavour to show that the advertising rogue\r\nbelongs to no particular class or profession, and that it is idle to\r\nassume that any rank or class is answerable for him, we shall be well\r\nsatisfied. To our mind, and we have studied the subject rather closely,\r\nthe advertising swindler is a swindler _per se_, and attaches himself to\r\nanything which offers a return, without caring what its title so long as\r\nit has claims to attention. It would be a great pity, therefore, to\r\nassume that these men have anything to do with the respectable forms of\r\nthe professions--from sporting to religion--they from time to time\r\nadopt, and a great blunder to blame any body of respectable men because\r\na lot of rogues choose to assume their business. As long as there are\r\nadvertising swindlers, some profession or other must have the discredit\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, still advertisement swindles of a totally different\r\ndescription from any that have been here mentioned or referred to. There\r\nis the swindle of the newspaper proprietor who guarantees a circulation\r\nwhich has no existence, and who, when he takes the money of those who\r\ninsert notices in his journal, knows that he is committing a deliberate\r\nand barefaced robbery. There are in London, at the present time, papers\r\nthat have absolutely no circulation, in the proper sense of the word,\r\nwhatever; and of which only a sufficient number of copies is printed to\r\nsupply those who advertise in them, according to the custom observed in\r\nmany offices. The readers, therefore, pay a rather heavy premium for the\r\nprivilege of perusing each other’s announcements. It may seem that this\r\nstate of affairs cannot possibly continue long; but whatever theorists\r\nmay make of it, we can speak with confidence of more than six papers\r\nwhich to our knowledge have possessed no buyers whatever for more than\r\nsix years, yet their proprietors get good livings out of them--better,\r\nperhaps, than they would if sale and not swindle was the reason of their\r\nbeing--and calculate on continuing this state of things for their time\r\nat all events. After them the deluge may come as soon as it likes. We\r\nremember quite well an office in which six of these newspapers were\r\nprinted--that is, supposed to be printed, for with the exception of an\r\nalteration of title and a rearrangement of columns, and with, very\r\nrarely, the substitution of a new leading article for an old one, these\r\nsix newspapers were all one and the same to the printers. Now, of\r\ncourse, had there been any chance of one man buying two copies of this\r\ninstrument of robbery under any two of its distinct names, the swindle\r\nwould have run some risk of being exposed; but so far as we could\r\ndiscover, there was no desire ever shown to buy even one, the\r\ncirculation being exclusively among the advertisers. A very small\r\ncirculation which finds its way in any particular direction may often be\r\nfar more useful to one who wishes his notice to travel that way than\r\nwould the largest circulation in the world; but the intensest of\r\noptimists could hardly discern any likelihood of benefit in the system\r\njust noticed.\r\n\r\nStill another kind of advertisement swindle--still more distinct from\r\nthe general run of swindles--is that by which certain ambitious persons\r\ntry to obtain a spurious notoriety. Their desire is in no way connected\r\nwith trade, though as it has in its effect the passing off of inferior\r\nwares upon the public as though they were of first-class quality, the\r\nword swindle very properly applies to their little trickery. These men\r\npine for recognition in the public prints, and so long as their names\r\nare mentioned, no matter how, they regard the task of achieving a cheap\r\nimmortality as progressing towards completion. Literature and the\r\nvarious phases of art suffer most from these impostors, who very often\r\nnot only attain notoriety by means of the specious puffery they\r\nexercise, but by it obtain money as well. No one can be blind to the\r\nmanner in which some very small literary lights manage to keep their\r\nnames continually paraded before the public; and the puffs are so worded\r\nthat the unthinking are bound to believe that these rushlight writers\r\nare the souls of the literature and journalism of the present day. Said\r\nthe publisher of a magazine, who is not renowned for either taste or\r\neducation, when it was proposed that a really eminent man should write\r\nhim an article, “No; I dessay he’s very good, but I want men with names.\r\nI can get Montague Smith and Chumley Jones and Montmorency Thomson, all\r\nfamous, and all glad to write for two pound a sheet--why, I never heard\r\nof your man, and yet he wants ten times as much. I never see his name in\r\nthe papers.” This was the publisher who is said to have refused to pay\r\nfor the refrain of a set of verses except where it first occurred, and\r\ndemanded that the rest should be measured off and deducted from the\r\nprice originally agreed upon. So not only in the case of the publisher,\r\nbut in that of the public do these small potatoes, who have a knack of\r\nglossing over their mean surnames with high-sounding prefixes, render\r\nthemselves representatives of an institution the real leaders in which\r\nare often quite unknown out of their own circles. For every thousand\r\nfamiliar with the name of Shakespeare Green, the writer of “awfuls,”\r\nthere is not one who can tell you who are the editors of the leading\r\ndaily papers and principal reviews. The anonymity of journalism has its\r\nadvantages, and very likely the directors of public opinion are content\r\nto remain behind its curtain; but it is through this same anonymous\r\narrangement that the smallest of small fry measured on their merits are\r\nenabled to parade themselves as they do. There are, we know, many\r\ndeservedly well and widely known writers for newspapers and serials who\r\nare really what they profess to be, and who depend upon nothing so much\r\nas merit, for success; but even they must admit the truth of what we\r\nhave said, and must often feel very like the apples did as they went\r\ndown stream in the fable.\r\n\r\nIt might be as well here to say a few words about the advertisement\r\nswindles that are perpetrated by means of photographs. It has long been\r\na crying evil that at certain theatres shameless women who wear many\r\ndiamonds and few clothes are allowed to appear upon the stage and play\r\nat acting. Much training enables them now and again to deliver\r\nhalf-a-dozen lines without displaying their ignorance and peculiarity of\r\naspiration too glaringly; but they cannot be depended on to do even this\r\nmuch with certainty. Sometimes they sing in the smallest of small\r\nvoices, and a few of them have mastered the breakdown and the _can-can_;\r\nbut their chief attraction consists, to the audience, in their lavish\r\ndisplay of limbs and “neck,” and, to the manager, in their requiring but\r\nnominal salaries. One would have thought it sufficient that such\r\ncreatures should exhibit themselves to the people who choose to go and\r\nsee them; but it is not so, they get themselves photographed in the most\r\nextraordinary attitudes, and their counterfeit presentments leer out\r\nfrom the shop windows upon passers-by in much the same manner as in the\r\nflesh--sometimes in very much of it--they leer at their friends in the\r\nstalls and boxes. Now and again we see the portrait of one real and\r\njustly-celebrated actress surrounded by these demireps, but of late what\r\nare known as actresses’ portraits consist mainly of those to whom the\r\ntitle is convenient, or of those who combine a little of the actress\r\nwith a great deal of the courtesan. Those artists whose portraits should\r\ngrace the photographers’ show-cases hardly care to run the risk of being\r\nmixed up in the questionable society they see there; and we can vouch\r\nfor the fact that in a leading thoroughfare, of twenty-five English\r\nportraits exhibited in a window as those of actresses, at which we were\r\nlooking but recently, there were not five that were really what they\r\npretended to be.\r\n\r\nOf hoaxes which come within our scope a very noticeable one took place\r\nin August 1815. A short time previous to the departure of the French\r\nEmperor from our coast on his last journey, to St Helena, a\r\nrespectably-dressed man caused a quantity of handbills to be distributed\r\nthrough Chester, in which he informed the public that a great number of\r\ngenteel families had embarked at Plymouth, and would certainly proceed\r\nwith the British regiment appointed to accompany the ex-Emperor to St\r\nHelena: he added further, that the island being dreadfully infested with\r\nrats, his Majesty’s ministers had determined that it should be forthwith\r\neffectually cleared of those noxious animals. To facilitate this\r\nimportant purpose, he had been deputed to purchase as many cats and\r\nthriving kittens as could possibly be procured for money, in a short\r\nspace of time; and therefore he publicly offered in his handbills\r\n“sixteen shillings for every _athletic full-grown tom-cat_, ten\r\nshillings for every _adult female puss_, and half-a-crown for every\r\nthriving _vigorous kitten_ that could _swill_ milk, pursue a ball of\r\nthread, or fasten its young fangs in a dying mouse.” On the evening of\r\nthe third day after this advertisement had been distributed, the people\r\nof Chester were astonished by an irruption of a multitude of old women,\r\nboys, and girls into their streets, each of whom carried on his or her\r\nshoulders either a bag or a basket, which appeared to contain some\r\nrestless animal. Every road, every lane, was thronged with this comical\r\nprocession; and before night a congregation of nearly three thousand\r\ncats was collected in Chester. The happy bearers of these sweet-voiced\r\ncreatures proceeded (as directed by the advertisement) towards one\r\nstreet with their delectable burdens. Here they became closely wedged\r\ntogether. A vocal concert soon ensued. The women screamed; the cats\r\nsqualled; the boys and girls shrieked aloud, and the dogs of the street\r\nhowled to match, so that it soon became difficult for the nicest ear to\r\nascertain whether the canine, the feline, or the human tones were\r\npredominant. Some of the cat-bearing ladies, whose dispositions were not\r\nof the most placid nature, finding themselves annoyed by their\r\nneighbours, soon cast down their burdens and began to box. A battle\r\nroyal ensued. The cats sounded the war-whoop with might and main.\r\nMeanwhile the boys of the town, who seemed mightily to relish the sport,\r\nwere actively employed in opening the mouths of the deserted sacks, and\r\nliberating the cats from their forlorn situations. The enraged animals\r\nbounded immediately on the shoulders and heads of the combatants, and\r\nran spitting, squalling, and clawing along the undulating sea of skulls,\r\ntowards the walls of the houses of the good people of Chester. The\r\ncitizens, attracted by the noise, had opened the windows to gaze at the\r\nfun. The cats, rushing with the rapidity of lightning up the pillars,\r\nand then across the balustrades and galleries, for which the town is so\r\nfamous, leaped slap-dash through the open windows into the apartments.\r\nNever, since the days of the celebrated Hugh Lupus, were the\r\ndrawing-rooms of Chester filled with such a crowd of unwelcome guests.\r\nNow were heard the crashes of broken china; the howling of affrighted\r\ndogs; the cries of distressed damsels, and the groans of well-fed\r\ncitizens. All Chester was soon in arms; and dire were the deeds of\r\nvengeance executed on the feline race. Next morning above five hundred\r\ndead bodies were seen floating on the river Dee, where they had been\r\nignominiously thrown by the two-legged victors. The rest of the invading\r\nhost having evacuated the town, dispersed in the utmost confusion to\r\ntheir respective homes.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 the following handbill was circulated in Norwich and its\r\nneighbourhood for some days previous to the date mentioned in it, and\r\ncaused great excitement:--\r\n\r\n  _St James’s Hill, back of the Horse Barracks._\r\n\r\n  The Public are respectfully informed that Signor CARLO GRAM VILLECROP,\r\n  the celebrated Swiss Mountain Flyer, from Geneva and Mont Blanc, is\r\n  just arrived in this City, and will exhibit with a Tyrolese Pole,\r\n  fifty feet long, his most astonishing Gymnastic Flights, never before\r\n  witnessed in this country. Signor Villecrop has had the great honour\r\n  of exhibiting his most extraordinary Feats on the Continent before the\r\n  King of Prussia, Emperor of Austria, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and\r\n  all the resident Nobility in Switzerland. He begs to inform the Ladies\r\n  and Gentlemen of this City that he has selected St James’s Hill and\r\n  the adjoining hills for his performances, and will first display his\r\n  remarkable strength in running up the hill with his Tyrolese Pole\r\n  between his teeth. He will next lay on his back, and balance the same\r\n  Pole on his nose, chin, and different parts of his body. He will climb\r\n  upon it with the astonishing swiftness of a cat, and stand on his head\r\n  at the top; on a sudden he will leap three feet from the Pole without\r\n  falling, suspending himself by a shenese cord only. He will also walk\r\n  on his head up and down the hill, balancing the Pole on one foot. Many\r\n  other feats will be exhibited, in which Signor Villecrop will display\r\n  to the audience the much-admired art of toppling, peculiar only to the\r\n  Peasantry of Switzerland. He will conclude his performance by repeated\r\n  flights in the air, up and down the hill, with a velocity almost\r\n  imperceptible, assisted only by his Pole, with which he will\r\n  frequently jump the astonishing distance of Forty and Fifty Yards at a\r\n  time. Signor Villecrop begs to assure the ladies and gentlemen who\r\n  honour him with their company that no money will be collected till\r\n  after the exhibition, feeling convinced that his exertions will be\r\n  liberally rewarded by their generosity. The Exhibition to commence on\r\n  Monday, the 28th of August 1826, precisely at half-past five o’clock\r\n  in the evening.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 28th August there were more than twenty thousand\r\npeople assembled at the foot of the hill, on foot, on horseback, and in\r\nevery kind of conveyance. Of course Signor Carlo Gram Villecrop did not\r\nput in an appearance, for that best of all the reasons that could be\r\ngiven--his having no existence out of the minds of the perpetrators of\r\nthe swindle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had intended to introduce as a congenial subject the great\r\nbottle-trick hoax, but as we have already run to such length, and as\r\nthis famous piece of humbug will stand well alone, we give it a chapter\r\nto itself.\r\n\r\n  [36] Book of Days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n_THE GREAT BOTTLE-TRICK SWINDLE._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year 1748, or in the beginning of 1749, the Duke of\r\nMontague, Lord Portman, and some other noblemen were talking about the\r\ngullibility of the people, and the Duke offered to wager that, let a man\r\nadvertise the most impossible thing in the world, he would find fools\r\nenough in London to fill a playhouse, and pay handsomely for the\r\nprivilege of being there. “Surely,” said the Earl of Chesterfield, “if a\r\nman should say that he would jump into a quart bottle, nobody would\r\nbelieve that.” The Duke was somewhat staggered at this, but for the sake\r\nof the jest determined to make the experiment. Accordingly the following\r\nadvertisement was inserted in the papers of the first week in January\r\n1749:--\r\n\r\n  AT the New Theatre in the Hay market, on Monday next, the 12th\r\n  instant, is to be seen a Person who performs the several most\r\n  surprising things following, viz.--1st. He takes a common walking Cane\r\n  from any of the Spectators, and thereon plays the music of every\r\n  Instrument now in use, and likewise sings to surprising\r\n  perfection.--2dly. He presents you with a common Wine Bottle, which\r\n  any of the spectators may first examine; this Bottle is placed on a\r\n  Table in the middle of the Stage, and he (without any equivocation)\r\n  goes into it, in the sight of all the Spectators, and sings in it;\r\n  during his stay in the bottle, any Person may handle it, and see\r\n  plainly that it does not exceed a common Tavern Bottle.--Those on the\r\n  Stage, or in the Boxes, may come in masked habits (if agreeable to\r\n  them); and the Performer, if desired, will inform them who they\r\n  are.--Stage, 7s. 6d. Boxes, 5s. Pit, 3s. Gallery, 2s. Tickets to be\r\n  had at the Theatre:--To begin at half an hour after six o’clock. The\r\n  performance continues about two hours and a half.\r\n\r\n  _Note._-If any Gentlemen or Ladies (after the above Performance)\r\n  either single or in company, in or out of mask, is desirous of seeing\r\n  a representation of any deceased Person, such as Husband or Wife,\r\n  Sister or Brother, or any intimate Friend of either sex, upon making a\r\n  gratuity to the Performer, shall be gratified by seeing and conversing\r\n  with them for some minutes, as if alive; likewise, if desired, he will\r\n  tell you your most secret thoughts in your past Life, and give you a\r\n  full view of persons who have injured you, whether dead or alive. For\r\n  those Gentlemen and Ladies who are desirous of seeing this last part,\r\n  there is a private Room provided.\r\n\r\n  These performances have been seen by most of the crowned Heads of\r\n  Asia, Africa, and Europe, and never appeared public any where but\r\n  once; but will wait on any at their Houses, and perform as above, for\r\n  five Pounds each time. A proper guard is appointed to prevent\r\n  disorder.\r\n\r\nOn the appointed day the theatre was crowded to excess, but as there was\r\nnot even a single fiddle provided to keep the audience in good-humour,\r\nsigns of impatience soon began to manifest themselves. When the hour was\r\npast at which the conjuror had to make his appearance, there arose a\r\nhorrible uproar, and the loud cat-calls, heightened by cries and beating\r\nof sticks, soon brought a person on the stage, who, amidst endless\r\nbowing and scraping, declared that if the performer did not appear\r\nwithin a quarter of an hour, the money should be returned. At the same\r\ntime a wag in the pit exclaimed that if the ladies and gentlemen would\r\ngive double prices he would creep into a pint bottle. Scarcely was the\r\nquarter of an hour’s grace elapsed, when a gentleman in one of the boxes\r\nseized a lighted candle and threw it on the stage. This was the signal\r\nfor a general outbreak, the benches were torn up and everything that\r\ncould be moved was thrown about. The greater part of the audience made\r\nthe best of their way out of the house, the rush to the doors being so\r\ndreadful that wigs, hats, cloaks, and dresses, were left behind and\r\nlost. Meantime the mob remained and almost gutted the building: the wood\r\nwas carried into the street and made into a mighty bonfire, whilst the\r\ncurtain was hoisted upon a pole by way of a flag. Of the conjuror\r\nnothing was ever heard, but the affair gave rise to a number of curious\r\nadvertisements. The Duke of Cumberland having lost his sword in the\r\ngeneral panic, it was advertised in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n  LOST, last Monday night at the Little Play house in the Hay market, a\r\n  Sword with a gold Hilt and cutting Blade, with a crimson and gold\r\n  Swordknot tied round the Hilt. Whoever brings it to Mr Chevenix’s Toy\r\n  shop, over against Great Suffolk Street, near Chearing Cross, shall\r\n  receive thirty Guineas reward, and no Questions asked.\r\n\r\nIt was probably a Jacobite who answered this by the following:--\r\n\r\n  FOUND entangled in the slit of a Lady’s demolished smock Petticoat, a\r\n  gold hilted Sword, of martial length and temper, nothing worse for\r\n  wear, with the Spey curiously wrought on one side of the blade, and\r\n  the Scheldt on the other; supposed to have been stolen from the plump\r\n  side of a great General, in his precipitate retreat from the Battle of\r\n  Bottle-Noodles, at Station Foote. Enquire at the Quart Bottle and\r\n  Musical Cane in Potter’s Row.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--Every word of a certain late advertisement is true, except all\r\n  the advertisement.\r\n\r\nFoote having been blamed by many for the occurrence of this disgraceful\r\nhoax, excused himself by an advertisement, in which he threw the blame\r\nupon Potter, the proprietor of the playhouse, whom Foote had warned that\r\nhe thought a fraud on the public was intended. To this Potter replied by\r\na counter-advertisement, explaining the precautions he had taken: how he\r\nhad not allowed the conjuror or any of his men to take the money, but\r\nplaced his own servants at the door, and how he would have returned it\r\nall, but that the house was sacked and the takings stolen. On the 20th\r\nof January there appeared an advertisement of Potter’s, which ran as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS a letter signed S. M. dated the 18th instant, was sent\r\n  yesterday by the Penny Post, directed to Mr Potter, in the Hay market;\r\n  which by the contents seems to come from the person who took Mr\r\n  Potter’s Theatre, for Monday last; wherein he complains of much ill\r\n  usage, and insists that the Man can perform the things he advertised,\r\n  and would have performed them, and was actually in a Coach in order to\r\n  come, but was intimidated by two Gentlemen who came from the Gun\r\n  Tavern, who told him he would be taken up if he performed: and in his\r\n  Letter he threatens, that in case Mr Potter will not give him £22,\r\n  which he says he was out of pocket, that he will apply to some Court\r\n  of Law or Equity, for justice: He also desires an answer in this\r\n  Paper--In answer to which, S. M. is desired to appear personally and\r\n  to give an Account of his Name and place of Abode; and he shall have\r\n  such Satisfaction as in justice deserves.\r\n\r\n  JOHN POTTER.\r\n\r\nThe same paper also contained the following exculpation:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS the Public was on Monday last basely abused by an Impostor,\r\n  who pretended to perform what was impracticable, at the Theatre in the\r\n  Hay market; the same imposition some evil-minded villains imagined\r\n  John Coustos, Lapidary, to be the author of: This is to assure the\r\n  Public that the said John Coustos had never such Design, nor ever\r\n  hired or caused to be hired, the House on any occasion whatever; and\r\n  to caution those his Enemies, who are the Authors of this Report, not\r\n  to assert a thing which they know to be a gross Falsity: And there are\r\n  those who are ready to attest on Oath that he was in their company\r\n  that Evening, and was at the Theatre as a spectator only.\r\n\r\n  JOHN COUSTOS.\r\n\r\nMany attempts were made to fathom the depth and discover the origin of\r\nthis hoax, and several humorous explanations were given in the papers,\r\namong them being the following:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS various stories have been told the Public, about the Man and\r\n  the Bottle, the following account seems to be the best as yet given of\r\n  that odd Affair; viz. A Gentleman went to him the same evening he was\r\n  to perform in the Haymarket, and asking him what he must have to\r\n  perform to him in private, he said £5, on which they agreed; and the\r\n  Conjuror getting ready to go into the Bottle, which was set on a\r\n  Table, the gentleman having provided a Parcel of Corks, fitted one to\r\n  the Bottle; then the Conjuror, having darkened the Room as much as was\r\n  necessary, at last with much squeezing got into the Bottle, which, in\r\n  a moment the Gentleman corked up, and whipt into his Pocket, and in\r\n  great haste and seeming confusion, went out of the House, telling the\r\n  Servants who waited at the door, that their Master had bewitched him,\r\n  and bid them go in and take care of him. Thus the poor Man being bit\r\n  himself, in being confined in the Bottle and in a Gentleman’s Pocket,\r\n  could not be in another Place; for he never advertised he would go\r\n  into two Bottles at one and the same time. He is still in the\r\n  Gentleman’s custody, who uncorks him now and then to feed him; but his\r\n  long Confinement has so damped his Spirits, that instead of singing\r\n  and dancing, he is perpetually crying and cursing his ill Fate. But\r\n  though the Town have been disappointed of seeing him go into the\r\n  Bottle, in a few days they will have the pleasure of seeing him come\r\n  out of the Bottle; of which timely notice will be given in the daily\r\n  Papers.\r\n\r\nPamphlets ridiculing the public for its gullibility issued from the\r\npress with alarming rapidity, and advertisements of performances equally\r\nimpossible as the bottle-hoax continued to be inserted in the papers for\r\nseveral weeks after. Among them were the following:--\r\n\r\n  _Lately arrived from Italy,_\r\n\r\n  SIGNOR CAPITELLO JUMPEDO a surprising Dwarf, no taller than a common\r\n  _Tavern Tobacco Pipe_: who can perform many wonderful Equilibres on\r\n  the slack or tight Rope: likewise he will transform his Body in above\r\n  ten thousand different Shapes and Postures, and after he has diverted\r\n  the Spectators two hours and a half, _he will open his Mouth wide_ and\r\n  jump down his own Throat! He being the most wonderfullest Wonder of\r\n  Wonders, as ever the World wondered at, would be willing to join in\r\n  performance with that surprising Musician, on Monday next in the Hay\r\n  market. He is to be spoke with at the Black Raven in Golden Lane,\r\n  every day from seven till twelve, and from two to all day long.\r\n\r\nThis was also an emanation caused by the current excitement, and was\r\npublished January 27, 1749:--\r\n\r\n  DON JOHN DE NASAQUITINE, sworn Brother and Companion to the Man that\r\n  was to have jumped into the Bottle at the Little Theatre in the Hay\r\n  market, on Monday the 16th past; hereby invites all such as were then\r\n  disappointed to repair to the Theatre aforesaid on Monday the 30th;\r\n  and _that_ shall be exhibited unto them, which never has heretofore,\r\n  nor ever will be hereafter seen. All such as shall swear upon the Book\r\n  of Wisdom that they paid for seeing the Bottle Man will be admitted\r\n  gratis; the rest at Gotham prices.\r\n\r\nAnd then the public were treated to this, for the purpose of keeping up\r\nthe interest:--\r\n\r\n  _Lately arrived from Ethiopia,_\r\n\r\n  THE most wonderful and surprising Doctor BENIMBE ZAMMANPOANGO, Oculist\r\n  and Body Surgeon to Emperor of Monoemungi, who will perform on Sunday\r\n  next, at the little T---- in the Hay market, the following surprising\r\n  Operations; viz. 1st, He desires any one of the Spectators only to\r\n  pull out his own Eyes, which as soon as he has done, the Doctor will\r\n  shew them to any Lady or Gentleman then present, to convince them\r\n  there is no Cheat, and then replace them in the Sockets, as perfect\r\n  and entire as ever. 2dly, He desires any officer or other, to rip up\r\n  his own Belly, which when he has done, he (without any Equivocation)\r\n  takes out his Bowels, washes them, and returns them to their place,\r\n  without the Person’s suffering the least hurt. 3dly, He opens the head\r\n  of a J---- of P----, takes out his Brains, and exchanges them for\r\n  those of a Calf; the Brains of a Beau for those of an Ass, and the\r\n  Heart of a Bully for that of a Sheep: which Operations will render the\r\n  Persons more sociable and rational Creatures than they ever were in\r\n  their Lives. And to convince the town that no imposition is intended,\r\n  he desires no Money until the Performance is over. Boxes, 5 guin. Pit\r\n  3. Gallery 2.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--The famous Oculist will be there, and honest S---- F---- H----\r\n  will come if he can. Ladies may come masked, so may Fribbles. The\r\n  Faculty and Clergy gratis. The Orator would be there, but is engaged.\r\n\r\nMoney seems to have been at least as plentiful as wit in those days,\r\nfor, from a lot of other notices bearing on this subject, we take\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\n  _This is to inform the Public,_\r\n\r\n  THAT notwithstanding the great Abuse that has been put upon the\r\n  Gentry, there is now in Town a Man, who instead of creeping into a\r\n  Quart or Pint Bottle, _will change himself into a Rattle_; which he\r\n  hopes will please both young and old. If this Person meets with\r\n  encouragement to this Advertisement, he will then acquaint the Gentry\r\n  where and when he performs.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, and notwithstanding all the expenditure of wit\r\nand humour upon the credulity of the times that had been made, one\r\nshowman still thought there was room left for a further attempt at\r\nattracting the public with the tenant of a bottle. Very soon after the\r\ngreat hoax he published the following advertisement, which shows the\r\ndesire some industrious people have to avail themselves of the general\r\ndisposition of the time. The faculty of imitation is very largely\r\ndeveloped nowadays, as witness what follows as soon as any enterprising\r\ntheatrical manager makes “a hit,” and so it is pleasant to find that an\r\nhonest penny was turned in humble imitation of the great bottle\r\nswindle:--\r\n\r\n  _To be seen at_ MR LEADER’S, _the Old Horseshoe, in Wood Street,\r\n  Cheapside, from Nine till Twelve, and from Four to Seven o’Clock,\r\n  Lately brought from France_,\r\n\r\n  A FULL grown MOUSE alive, confined in a small two ounce Phial, the\r\n  Neck of which is not a quarter of an inch Diameter. This amusing\r\n  Creature has lived in the Phial three Years and a half without Drink\r\n  or any Sustenance but Bread only. It cleans out its little Habitation,\r\n  and hath many other pretty Actions, as surprising as agreeable; but\r\n  particularly creates wonderful diversion with a Fly, and is allowed to\r\n  be an extraordinary Curiosity, never before seen in England; at the\r\n  Expense of 6d. each Person.\r\n\r\n  _Note._--Gentlemen or Ladies who don’t chuse to come, it shall be\r\n  carried to them, by sending a line to MR LEADER.\r\n\r\nLike everything else of its kind, the excitement in connection with the\r\nbottle-hoax soon gave way to fresh topics of public interest. The trick\r\nhas, however, been revived occasionally with more or less effect; and\r\nTheodore Hook’s cruel, and not particularly clever, hoax, which made a\r\nhouse in Berners Street notorious and its occupants miserable, was but a\r\nphase of the swindle just related; and being so, loses whatever merit it\r\npossessed in the eyes of those who will sacrifice anything to a joke, so\r\nlong, of course, as it is original and does not interfere with their own\r\ncomfort or convenience. Deprived of its originality, Hook’s exploit\r\nstands forth as a trick hardly excusable in a boy, and utterly at\r\nvariance with the character of a gentleman. Now in the bottle-hoax there\r\nwas quite a different element; people were invited to the theatre to see\r\nthat which they must have known was utterly impossible. In obedience to\r\nthe laws which govern human nature, they readily accepted the\r\ninvitation, and also, in accordance with the same laws, they resented\r\nthe affront they considered had been put upon them. A moral might be\r\ndeduced from this, were it not for the fact, that if any hoax analogous\r\nto the bottle-trick were to be advertised to-morrow in a conspicuous\r\nmanner, the proportion of dupes would be at least as great as it was in\r\n1749. Perhaps greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n_QUACKS AND IMPOSTORS._\r\n\r\n\r\nQuacks have been in existence so long, have received so much of the\r\nconfidence of the people, and have afforded such capital to satirists\r\nand humourists, that they have become almost a necessity of our\r\nexistence, from a literary as well as from a domestic point of view.\r\nThey also add considerably to the revenue, if only through the impost\r\nupon patent medicines; for though many may be astonished and horrified\r\nto hear it, all patent medicines--_i.e._, all medicines which bear the\r\ninland-revenue stamp--are of necessity quack, and although many\r\npartisans may endeavour to prove that in the particular case each may\r\nselect, this is not so, the qualification must fairly be applied, if\r\napplied to anything, to all medicines which are supposed to specifically\r\nremedy various diseases in various systems, no matter what the\r\npeculiarities of either. It can hardly matter whether the inventor of\r\nthe general remedy be learned doctor or impudent charlatan, the\r\nmedicine, as soon as ever it assumes specific powers, and is to be\r\nadministered by or to anybody, is quack, not only in the proper\r\nacceptation of the term, but in its original signification. Quacks are,\r\nwith a few notable exceptions, a very different body now from what they\r\nwere in the last century, when they killed more than they cured, and\r\nwhen drugs were compounded with a recklessness which seems quite\r\nimpossible in these moderate days. Just and proper legislation has\r\nclipped the wings of the vile impostors who used to trade upon the\r\nweaknesses of human nature, and with the exception of those pestiferous\r\npractitioners whose advertisements are as noxious as their\r\nprescriptions, and who find the fittest possible media for publication,\r\nquacks are no longer in existence except as purveyors of patent\r\nmedicines, pills, ointment, and plasters; and so if there is no cure\r\nthere is also no kill. Formerly the quack prescribed and compounded, and\r\nthen he was indeed dangerous, and we cannot better prove this than by\r\nmeans of a remark in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ of July 1734 about\r\nJoshua Ward, an advertisement in reference to whom is to be found in the\r\nhistorical part of this book. The paragraph in the old magazine runs:\r\n“There was an extraordinary advertisement in the newspapers this month\r\nconcerning the great cures in all distempers performed with one\r\nmedicine, a pill or drop, by Joshua Ward, Esq., lately arrived from\r\nParis, where he had done the like cures. ’Twas said our physicians,\r\nparticularly Sir Hans Sloane, had found out his secret, but ’twas judged\r\nso violent a prescription, that it would be deemed malepractice to apply\r\nit as a dose to old and young and in all cases.” And again, in the\r\nObituary in the same periodical for 1736, there is an advertisement\r\nbearing on this so-called remedy rather unfavourably. It runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  _Vesey Hart_, Esq. of _Lincoln’s Inn_. About 15 Months ago he took the\r\n  celebrated Pill, which had at first such violent effects as to throw\r\n  him into Convulsions and deprive him of his Sight. On recovery he fell\r\n  into Consumption.\r\n\r\nJoshua Ward was rather a celebrity about that time, even among quacks,\r\nas the following lines from the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ of July 1734 will\r\nshow. The heading is--\r\n\r\n  UNIV. SPEC. ON WARD’S _Drops_.\r\n\r\n    _EGregious Ward_, you boast with success sure,\r\n    That your _one drop_ can _all_ distempers cure:\r\n    When it in _S----n cures_ ambition’s _pain_\r\n    Or ends the _Megrims_ of Sir _James’_ brain,\r\n    Of _wounded conscience_ when it _heals_ the _smart_,\r\n    And on _reflexion_ glads the statesman’s heart;\r\n    When it to women palls old _M--ar--’s gust_,\r\n    And _cools_ ’fore death the _fever_ of his _lust_;\r\n    When _F----d_ it can give of _wit_ a _taste_,\r\n    Make _Harriot_ pious or _lorima_ chaste;\r\n    Make scribbling _B--dg-- deviate_ into _sense_,\r\n    Or give to _Pope_ more wit and excellence;\r\n    Then will I think that your ONE DROP will save\r\n    _Ten thousand_ dying patients from the _grave_.\r\n\r\nIn the _Daily Advertiser_ of June 10, 1736, there is a puff\r\nadvertisement for Ward, which runs:--\r\n\r\n  We hear that by the Queen’s appointment, Joshua Ward, Esq; and eight\r\n  or ten persons, who in extraordinary Cases have receiv’d great benefit\r\n  by taking his remedies, attended at the Court at Kensington on monday\r\n  night last, and his patients were examin’d before her Majesty by three\r\n  eminent surgeons, several persons of quality being present, when her\r\n  Majesty was graciously pleas’d to order money to be distributed\r\n  amongst the patients, and congratulated Mr Ward on his great success.\r\n\r\nIn the _Grub Street Journal_ of June 24 of the same year is an article\r\non the paragraph, in which it is stated that only seven persons attended\r\nat the palace, and that these were proved to be impostors who were in\r\ncollusion with Ward. The _Journal_ is very strong against the quack, and\r\nthe article concludes with the following lines, which are in fact a\r\nsummary of what has been said in the criticism upon Ward’s fresh attempt\r\nto gull the public:--\r\n\r\n  _Seven wonderful Cures._\r\n\r\n      One felt his sharp rheumatic pains no more:\r\n    A Second saw much better than before:\r\n    Three cur’d of stone, a dire disease much sadder,\r\n    Who still, ’tis thought, have each a stone in bladder:\r\n    A Sixth brought gravel bottled up and cork’d,\r\n    Which _Drop and Pill_, he say’d, by urine work’d;\r\n    But Questions, ask’d the Patient, all unravell’d;\r\n    Much more than whom the Doctor then was gravell’d.\r\n    The last a little Woman but great glutton,\r\n    Who at one meal eat two raw legs of mutton:\r\n    Nor wonder, since within her stomach lay\r\n    A Wolf, that gap’d for victuals night and day:\r\n    But when he smelt the Pill, he strait for shelter\r\n    Run slap into her belly helter skelter.\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity to take trouble for the purpose of discovering the\r\norigin of quacks. It is evident that they “came natural” as soon as ever\r\nthere was a chance for them, and it is but right to suppose that before\r\nquackery became a question of money-making, it had an existence, the\r\noutcome of a love people have innately for prescribing and administering\r\nto each other, relics of which may still be seen in out-of-the-way parts\r\nof the country. Some people imagine that quackery and the belief, still\r\ncurrent in various parts of Great Britain, that a seventh son,\r\nparticularly if the son of a seventh son, possesses medical powers, had\r\noriginally something to do with each other. That quackery in general was\r\ncaused by this quaint conceit is not to be supposed, yet the belief in\r\nthe seventh-son doctrine is well worthy of note. The vulgar mind seems\r\nfrom the earliest ages to have been impressed by the number seven, and\r\nthere are various ways of accounting for this. Chambers, in his “Book of\r\nDays,” says that it is easy to see in what way the Mosaic narrative gave\r\nsanctity to this number in connection with the days of the week, and led\r\nto usages which influence the social life of all the countries of\r\nEurope. “But a sort of mystical goodness or power has attached itself to\r\nthe number in many other ways. Seven wise men, seven champions of\r\nChristendom, seven sleepers, seven-league boots, seven ages of man,\r\nseven hills, seven senses, seven planets, seven metals, seven sisters,\r\nseven stars, seven wonders of the world--all have had their day of\r\nfavour; albeit that the number has been awkwardly interfered with by\r\nmodern discoveries concerning metals, planets, stars, and wonders of the\r\nworld. Added to the above list is the group of seven sons, especially in\r\nrelation to the youngest or seventh of the seven; and more especially\r\nstill if this person happen to be the seventh son of a seventh son. It\r\nis now perhaps impossible to discover in what country, or at what time,\r\nthe notion originated, but a notion there certainly is, chiefly in\r\nprovincial districts, that a seventh son has something peculiar about\r\nhim. For the most part, the imputed peculiarity is a healing power, a\r\nfaculty of curing diseases by the touch, or by some other means. The\r\ninstances of this belief are numerous enough. There is a rare pamphlet\r\ncalled ‘The Quack Doctor’s Speech,’ published in the time of Charles II.\r\nThe reckless Earl of Rochester delivered this speech on one occasion,\r\nwhen dressed in character, and mounted on a stage as a charlatan. The\r\nspeech, amid much that suited that licentious age, but would be frowned\r\ndown by modern society, contained an enumeration of the doctor’s\r\nwonderful qualities, among which was that of being a ‘seventh son of a\r\nseventh son,’ and therefore clever as a curer of bodily ills. The matter\r\nis only mentioned as affording a sort of proof of the existence of a\r\nsort of popular belief. In Cornwall, the peasants and the miners\r\nentertain this notion; they believe that a seventh son can cure the\r\nking’s evil by the touch. The mode of proceeding usually is to stroke\r\nthe part affected thrice gently, to blow upon it thrice, to repeat a\r\nform of words, and to give a perforated coin, or some other object, to\r\nbe worn as an amulet. At Bristol, about forty years ago, there was a man\r\nwho was always called ‘doctor’ simply because he was the seventh son of\r\na seventh son. The family of the Joneses of Muddfi, in Wales, is said to\r\nhave presented seven sons to each of many successive generations, of\r\nwhom the seventh son always became a doctor--apparently from a\r\nconviction that he had an inherited qualification to start with. In\r\nIreland, the seventh son of a seventh son is believed to possess\r\nprophetical as well as healing power. A few years ago a Dublin\r\nshopkeeper finding his errand-boy to be generally very dilatory in his\r\nduties, inquired into the cause, and found that the boy, being the\r\nseventh son of a seventh son, his services were often in requisition\r\namong the poorer neighbours, in a way that brought in a good many pieces\r\nof silver. Early in the present century there was a man in Hampshire,\r\nthe seventh son of a seventh son, who was consulted by the villagers as\r\na doctor, and who carried about with him a collection of crutches and\r\nsticks, purporting to have once belonged to persons whom he had cured of\r\nlameness. Cases are not wanting, also, in which the seventh daughter is\r\nplaced upon a similar pinnacle of greatness. In Scotland the spaewife or\r\nfortune-teller frequently announces herself as the seventh daughter of a\r\nseventh daughter, to enhance her claims to prophetic power. Even so late\r\nas 1851, an inscription was seen on a window in Plymouth, denoting that\r\na certain doctress was the third seventh daughter!--which the world was\r\nprobably intended to interpret as the seventh daughter of the seventh\r\ndaughter of a seventh daughter. . . . . France, as well as our own\r\ncountry, has a belief in the seventh-son mystery. The _Journal de\r\nLoiret_, a French provincial newspaper, in 1854 stated that, in Orleans,\r\nif a family has seven sons and no daughter, the seventh is called a\r\n_Marcou_, is branded with a fleur-de-lis, and is believed to possess the\r\npower of curing the king’s evil. The Marcou breathes on the part\r\naffected, or else the patient touches the Marcou’s fleur-de-lis. In the\r\nyear above named there was a famous Marcou in Orleans named Foulon; he\r\nwas a cooper by trade, and was known as ‘le beau Marcou.’ Simple\r\npeasants used to come to visit him from many leagues in all directions,\r\nparticularly in Passion-week, when his ministrations were believed to be\r\nmost efficacious. On the night of Good Friday, from midnight to sunrise,\r\nthe chance of cure was supposed to be especially good, and on this\r\naccount four or five hundred persons would assemble. Great disturbances\r\nhence arose; and as there was evidence, to all except the silly dupes\r\nthemselves, that Foulon made use of their superstition to enrich\r\nhimself, the police succeeded, but not without much opposition, in\r\npreventing these assemblages. In some of the states of Germany there\r\nused formerly to be a custom for the reigning prince to stand sponsor to\r\na seventh son (no daughter intervening) of any of his subjects. Whether\r\nstill acted upon is doubtful; but there was an incident lately which\r\nbore on the old custom in a curious way. A West-Hartlepool newspaper\r\nstated that Mr J. V. Curths, a German, residing in that busy colliery\r\ntown, became, towards the close of 1857, the father of one of those\r\nprodigies--a seventh son. Probably he himself was a Saxe-Gothan by\r\nbirth; at any rate he wrote to the Prince Consort, reminding him of the\r\nold German custom, and soliciting the honour of his Royal Highness’s\r\nsponsorship to the child. The Prince was doubtless a little puzzled by\r\nthis appeal, as he often must have been by the strange appeals made to\r\nhim. Nevertheless, a reply was sent in the Prince’s name, very\r\ncomplimentary to his countryman, and enclosing a substantial souvenir\r\nfor the little child; but the newspaper paragraph is not sufficiently\r\nclear for us to be certain whether the sponsorship really was assented\r\nto, and, if so, how it was performed.” It is not at all likely, proud as\r\nthe late Prince was of his countrymen, and of Germans generally, that he\r\ntook upon himself the pains and penalties of sponsorship to this\r\nmiraculous infant, whose father was doubtless well satisfied with the\r\ndouceur he received, and never expected even that.\r\n\r\nSaffold was an early humbug who depended mainly upon doggerel rhyme for\r\nattraction. It is to be hoped that his wares were better than his\r\nnumbers, or else the deaths of many must have lain heavy on his soul.\r\nOne of his bills, enumerating his address and claims upon the attention\r\nof the public, informs us that of him\r\n\r\n      _The Sick may have Advice for Nothing,_\r\n    And good Medicines cheap, if so they please\r\n    For to cure any curable Disease.\r\n    It’s _Saffold’s_ Pills, much better than the Rest,\r\n    Deservedly have gained the Name of best\r\n    In curing by the Cause, quite purging out\r\n    Of Scurvy, Dropsie, Agues, Stone and Gout.\r\n    The Head, Stomach, Belly and the Reins, they\r\n    Will cleanse and cure, while you may work or play.\r\n    His Pills have often, to their Maker’s Praise,\r\n    Cur’d in all Weathers, yea, in the Dog-Days.\r\n    In short, no purging Med’cine is made, can\r\n    Cure more Diseases in Man or Woman,\r\n    Than his cheap Pills, but three Shillings the Box.\r\n    Each Box contains Thirty-six Pills I’m sure.\r\n    As good as e’er were made Scurvy to cure.\r\n    The half Box eighteen Pills, for eighteen Pence,\r\n    Tho’ ’t is too cheap, in any Man’s own Sense.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the bill, after a lot of puffery, he breaks out into\r\nrhyme once more:--\r\n\r\n      Some envious Men being griev’d may say,\r\n    What needs Bills thus still be given away?\r\n    Answer: New People come to London every Day.\r\n    Believing Solomon’s Advice is right,\r\n    I will do what I do with all my might.\r\n    Also, unless an English Proverb lies\r\n    Practice brings Experience and makes wise.\r\n    Experimental Knowledge, I protest,\r\n    In lawful Arts and Science is the best,\r\n    Instead of _Finis_ Saffold ends with Rest.\r\n\r\nAnother of his bills, which were various and plentiful, began thus:--\r\n\r\n      Dear Friends, let your Disease be what God will,\r\n    Pray to Him for a Cure, try Saffold’s Skill;\r\n    Who may be such a healing Instrument,\r\n    As will cure you to your own Heart’s Content.\r\n    His Medicines are cheap and truly good.\r\n    Being full as safe as your daily Food--\r\n    Saffold he can do what may be done, by\r\n    Either Physick or true Astrology.\r\n    His best Pills, rare Elixir and Powder,\r\n    Do each Day praise him louder and louder.\r\n    Dear Countrymen, I pray be you so wise\r\n    When Men backbite him, believe not their Lies,\r\n    But go, see him, and believe your own Eyes.\r\n    Then he will say you are honest and kind.\r\n    Try before you judge and speak as you find.\r\n\r\nAt another time the muse informs us, among other things in connection\r\nwith the great Saffold, that\r\n\r\n    He knows some who are Knaves in Grain,\r\n    And have more Gall and Spleen than Brain,\r\n    Will ill reward his Skill and Pain.\r\n\r\n  He hath practised Astrology above 15 Years, and hath License to\r\n  practise Physick, and he thanks God for it, hath great Experience and\r\n  wonderful Success in both those Arts, giving to doubtful People and by\r\n  God’s Blessing, cureth the Sick of any Age or Sex or Distemper though\r\n  given over by Others, and never so bad (if curable); therefore let\r\n  none despair of a Cure, but try him.\r\n\r\n  Yet some conceited Fools will ask how he came to be able to do such\r\n  great Cures, and to foretell such strange Things, and to know how to\r\n  make such rare and powerful Medicines, as his best _Pills_, _Elixir_\r\n  and _Diet Drinks_ are, and wherefore he doth publish the same in\r\n  Print? But he will answer such dark Animals thus:\r\n\r\n      It hath so pleased God, the King of Heaven,\r\n    Being He to him hath Knowledge given,\r\n    And in him there can be no greater Sin,\r\n    Than to hide his Talent in a Napkin.\r\n    His Candle is Light and he will not under\r\n    A Bushel put it, let the World wonder:\r\n    Though he be traduced by such like Tools,\r\n    As have Knaves’ Hearts, Lackbrains are Fools.\r\n\r\n  ☞ ^I request a favourable Construction upon this Publick way of\r\n  Practice^ (^And^ _as I am a Graduate Physician_) _should wholly omit\r\n  to appear in Print, as well in this Disease as I have at all Times in\r\n  all other Diseases, only in Opposition to the Ignorant, that pretend\r\n  to Cure, and to prevent the ruine of them that suffer and I see daily\r\n  throw themselves upon ignorant and outlandish Pretenders and others,\r\n  to the Patient’s utter ruine of Body and Purse_. AND _upon this\r\n  Consideration alone, I was persuaded rather to adventure the censure\r\n  of_ some, than conceal that which may be of great use to many.\r\n\r\nOne other specimen of this artist’s verse and we will let him follow his\r\npredecessors. It may be as well to mention that when Saffold left the\r\nscene of his labours, “his mantle” was supposed to fall on one John\r\nCase, who followed in his footsteps so closely that the lines which had\r\ndone for one quack were often made to do for the other.\r\n\r\n    Saffold resolves, as in his Bills exprest,\r\n    When asked in good Earnest, not in Jest;\r\n    He can cure when God Almighty pleases,\r\n    But cannot protect against Diseases.\r\n    If Men will live intemperate and sin,\r\n    He cannot help ’t if they be sick agen.\r\n    This great Truth unto the World he will tell\r\n    None can cure sooner, who cures half so well.\r\n\r\nDr John Case was a contemporary of Dr Radcliffe, and a noted quack who\r\nunited the professions of an astrologer and a physician. He took the\r\nhouse in which Lilly had resided, and over his door was a vile distich\r\nwhich was said to have brought him more money than Dryden earned by all\r\nhis works. Upon his pill-boxes he placed the following curious rhyme:--\r\n\r\n    Here’s 14 Pills for 3 Pence\r\n    Enough is every Man’s own Con-sci-ence.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to find out when quacks were not, and as we have\r\nbefore remarked, as long as there have been advertisements, whether in\r\nnewspapers or elsewhere, these cunning rogues have been fully awake to\r\ntheir advantages and uses. One effusion, published as a handbill in the\r\ntime of William and Mary, is noticeable, as, though the advertisers call\r\nthemselves physicians, there is reason to doubt their right to the\r\ntitle, and to believe that the college was anything but what we now\r\nunderstand by the word. The bill proclaims itself as an\r\n\r\n  ADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n  The Physitians of the Colledge, that us’d to consult twice a Week for\r\n  the benefit of the Sick at the Consultation House, at the Carved Angel\r\n  and Crown in King-street, near Guildhall, meet now four times a Week;\r\n  and therefore give Publick Notice, that on Mondays, Wednesdays,\r\n  Thursdays and Fridays, from two in the afternoon till six, they may be\r\n  advised by the known Poor, and meaner Families for nothing; and that\r\n  their Expectations and Demands from the middle Rank shall be moderate:\r\n  but as for the Rich and Noble, Liberality is inseparable from their\r\n  Quality and Breeding.\r\n\r\nThis is, to say the least, peculiar, the quaint use of the word\r\n“advised” seeming very strange, while the wind-up shows that whoever and\r\nwhatever the physicians may have been, they were not likely to lose\r\nsight of the main chance. But their notice is feeble compared with\r\nanother handbill of the same period, which is of the most dogmatic\r\norder, and is called\r\n\r\n  _A friendly and seasonable Advertisement concerning the Dog-days, by_\r\n  Nath. Merry, Philo-Chim.\r\n\r\n  In regard that there are many that perish in and about this City, &c.\r\n  through an evil custom, arising from a false opinion That it is not\r\n  safe to take Physick in the Extreams of Heat and Cold or in the Dog\r\n  days; and some exclude old People, Women with Child and little\r\n  Children, from the use of Medicine; which is as much as to say, That\r\n  God hath ordained no Medicine for such Times and such Ages, which\r\n  would be absurd to imagine, seeing we know there is no Time, Age nor\r\n  Disease exempted from proper homogenial and effectual Means (with\r\n  God’s Blessing) only against Death there is no Medicine, the Time of\r\n  which to us is uncertain. From the aforesaid Mistakes many labour\r\n  under the tyranny of their Diseases, till the Catastrophe end in Death\r\n  (before the Time come which they have alotted for their Cure) which\r\n  might by timely and suitable Remedies be prevented. It’s granted _pro\r\n  confesso_ that there is a sort of _Dogmatical Medicines_, that is\r\n  unfit to be exhibited in those Times, and are not innocent at any\r\n  Time, being impregnated with venomenous Beams, which by their virulent\r\n  Hostility invade the vital Œconomy of the Body. But you may have\r\n  Archeal or Vital medicines, truly adapted for all Times; being\r\n  divested of their Crudities and heterogene Qualities, by a true\r\n  Separation of the pure from the impure, and impregnated with Beams of\r\n  Light, which give their Influences and refreshing Glances upon the\r\n  vital Faculties, expels Venoms, alters Ferments, co-unites with Nature\r\n  and re-unites its powers to their due Œconomy, and such Medicines\r\n  being most natural and most powerful in the most deplorable Diseases\r\n  being timely taken are most effectual, and are no more to be omitted\r\n  at any time than foods, and are altogether as safe.\r\n\r\nAnd so on at length, until Nath. Merry divulges the secret that he is\r\nthe man for the dog-days, and that all others are impostors, which in\r\ncommon with many remarks of the kind, found in most advertisements of\r\nthe same and other times issued by pretended curers of all known and\r\nmany unknown disorders, lead us to the belief that however willing\r\nquacks have always been to impose upon the credulous themselves, they\r\nhave been careful enough to expose the presumption of their rivals: a\r\nmerciful dispensation of providence, which has enabled the statements of\r\none rogue to be balanced, and to a certain extent neutralised, by those\r\nof another, and so the remedy is found in the disease when at its worst.\r\nHad it not been for the attacks made by empirics upon each other\r\nthroughout the last century, qualified medical men would have stood a\r\nvery bad chance, and as it is they seem to have often been obliged to\r\njoin the ranks of the rascals from sheer inability to get a living\r\nwithout pandering to the popular taste for infallible remedies and\r\nthings generally unknown to the pharmacopœia. Here is the commencement\r\nof an appeal made just prior to the year 1700 by one quack, which\r\nconsists in a warning against all others of the same profession, and\r\nwhich shows how anxious the writer is for the public benefit, except\r\nwhere his own is immediately concerned:--\r\n\r\n  A CAUTION TO THE UNWARY.\r\n\r\n  ’Tis generally acknowledged throughout all Europe, that no Nation has\r\n  been so fortunate in producing such eminent Physicians, as this\r\n  Kingdom of ours; and ’tis as obvious to every Eye, that no Country was\r\n  ever pestered with so many ignorant Quacks or Empirics. The Enthusiast\r\n  in Divinity having no sooner acted his Part, and had his _Exit_, but\r\n  on the same Stage, from his Shop (or some worse Place) enters the\r\n  Enthusiast in Physicks: yesterday a Taylor, Heelmaker, Barber, Serving\r\n  Man, Rope Dancer, etc., to-day _per saltum_ a learned Doctor, able to\r\n  instruct Esculapius himself, for he never obliged Mankind yet with a\r\n  _Panacæa_, an universal Pill or Powder that could cure all Diseases,\r\n  which now every Post can direct you to, though it proves only the\r\n  Hangman’s Remedy for all Diseases by Death. _Pudet hæc opprobria\r\n  dici_; for shame, my dear Countrymen, reassume your Reasons, and\r\n  expose not your Bodies and Purses to the handling of such illiterate\r\n  Fellows, who never had the Education of a Grammar-School, much less of\r\n  an University.\r\n\r\n  Nor be ye so irrational as to imagine anything extraordinary (unless\r\n  it be Ignorance) in a Pair of outlandish Whiskers, tho’ he’s so\r\n  impudent to tell you he has been Physician to 3 Emperours and 9 Kings\r\n  when in his own Country he durst not give Physick to a Cobbler.\r\n\r\n  Nor be gulled with another sort of Impostor, who allures you to him\r\n  with CURE WITHOUT MONEY, but when he once has got you into his\r\n  Clutches, he handles you as unmercifully as he does unskilfully.\r\n\r\n  Nor be ye imposed on by the Pretence of any _Herculean_ Medicine, that\r\n  shall with four Doses at 5s. a Dose, cure the most inveterate\r\n  Complaint, and Distempers not to be eradicated (in the Opinion of the\r\n  most learned in all Ages) with less than a Renovation of all the\r\n  Humours in the whole Body.\r\n\r\n  These and the like Abuses (too numerous here to be mentioned) have\r\n  induced me to continue this public Way of Information, that you may be\r\n  honestly dealt with, and perfectly cured, repairing to him, who with\r\n  God’s Blessing on his Studies and 20 Years successful Practice in this\r\n  City of London hath attained to the easiest and speediest way of\r\n  curing.\r\n\r\nThen follows the puff which this disinterested person gives to his own\r\nwares and powers, and if it is to be believed, he certainly proves to\r\ndemonstration that he is as good as the others are bad. The next item we\r\nhave is a bill of the early eighteenth century, headed by a rude woodcut\r\nof a unicorn’s horn. There is no address on it, and it looks as though\r\nused while travelling round the country, in which case the High-German’s\r\nlodging for the time being would be written or printed on the back, or\r\nsupplemented in one of the ways usual among itinerant charlatans:--\r\n\r\n  _The High-German, Master of the Waxwork,_\r\n\r\n  Hath an Unicorn’s Horn that was found in the Deserts of Arabia, the\r\n  Powder whereof does several wonderful Cures, whereof I was advised by\r\n  several Doctors to Publish the same in Print; the Cures that it has\r\n  done are as follow:\r\n\r\n  I have in my Travels, by the Virtues of this Powder, saved the Lives\r\n  of several Gentlewomen in Child-Bed, which could not be Delivered\r\n  before they took the Powder.\r\n\r\n  About October the Fifth, 1702, I was in the Town of Hampton, in the\r\n  County of Gloucester, at Mr Gardners, at the Sign of the White-Hart,\r\n  where I heard that one Mrs Webb was in Child-Bed and could not be\r\n  Delivered, so that Doctor Farr of the said Town, the Midwife and all\r\n  Women left her off for Dead, upon which I sent my Landlady with a\r\n  little of this Powder, the Quantity whereof would lie upon a\r\n  Six-pence, which the Gentlewoman took, and was Delivered in less than\r\n  a Quarter of an Hour; Doctor Farr has given it under his Hand, and\r\n  some other Gentlemen of the Town can testify, that this Powder was the\r\n  saving of her Life (under God).\r\n\r\n  Likewise this Powder is a certain Cure for the Kings-Evil, when it\r\n  breaks and runs: The Powder must be put on a Linnen Cloath and applied\r\n  to the Place, and take as much as will lie on a Six-pence for two\r\n  Mornings in warm Ale.\r\n\r\n  The College of Physitians in London, hearing of this Powder, they came\r\n  to my Lodging, on purpose to see this Horn, and desired me to let them\r\n  have some Experience to try if it would Expel Poyson, upon which they\r\n  sent for two Dogs and Poysoned them both, and asked me if I could save\r\n  one of them, whereupon I took a little Powder of this Horn in a\r\n  Spoonful of Milk, and gave it to one of them, that which I gave it to\r\n  was saved, and the other died in their Presence, after which the\r\n  Doctors offered me a great Sum of Money for this Horn, which I was not\r\n  willing to part with.\r\n\r\n  If there are any Gentlewomen desirous to Buy any of this Powder, I\r\n  Sell it at Reasonable Rates, and it may be kept Ten Years and not lose\r\n  its Virtue.\r\n\r\n  FINIS.\r\n\r\nIn Queen Anne’s time, and during the first years of the Hanoverian\r\nsuccession, quackery does not seem to have impaired its professors’\r\npositions in society, providing they had other claims to consideration,\r\nand even the most impudent impostors obtained rank and celebrity under\r\ncircumstances which hardly seem possible. Listen to the following: “Sir\r\nWilliam Read, originally a tailor or a cobbler, became progressively a\r\nmountebank and a quack doctor, and gained, in his case, the equivocal\r\nhonour of knighthood from Queen Anne. He is said to have practised by\r\n‘the light of nature:’ and though he could not read, he could ride in\r\nhis own chariot, and treat his company with good punch out of a golden\r\nbowl. He had an uncommon share of impudence; a few scraps of Latin in\r\nhis bills made the ignorant suppose him to be wonderfully learned. He\r\ndid not seek his reputation in small places, but practised at that high\r\nseat of learning, Oxford; and in one of his addresses he called upon the\r\nVice-Chancellor, University, and the City, to vouch for his cures--as,\r\nindeed, he did upon the people of the three kingdoms. Blindness vanished\r\nbefore him, and he even deigned to practise in other distempers; but he\r\ndefied all competition as an oculist. Queen Anne and George I. honoured\r\nRead with the care of their eyes; from which one would have thought the\r\nrulers, like the ruled, as dark intellectually as Taylor’s (his brother\r\nquack) coach-horses were corporeally, of which it was said five were\r\nblind in consequence of their master having exercised his skill upon\r\nthem.” Dr Radcliffe mentions this humbug as “Read the mountebank, who\r\nhas assurance enough to come to our table up-stairs at Garraway’s,\r\nswears he’ll stake his coach and six horses, his two blacks, and as many\r\nsilver trumpets, against a dinner at Pontack’s.” Read died at Rochester,\r\nMay 24, 1715. After Queen Anne had knighted him and Dr Hannes, the\r\nfollowing lines were published:--\r\n\r\n      The Queen, like Heav’n, shines equally on all,\r\n    Her favours now without distinction fall:\r\n    Great Read and slender Hannes, both knighted, show\r\n    That none their honours shall to merit owe.\r\n    That Popish doctrine is exploded quite,\r\n    Or Ralph had been no duke and Read no knight.\r\n    That none may virtue or their learning plead,\r\n    This has no grace and that can hardly read.\r\n\r\nThe Ralph referred to here is the first Duke of Montague, a title that\r\nhas already appeared conspicuously in these pages. In the matter of the\r\nbestowal of titles, especially knighthoods and baronetcies, we have no\r\nparticular reason to congratulate ourselves now, but we have certainly\r\nimproved since the days when rank was sold or bestowed upon the most\r\naudacious adventurers. So far as merit is concerned, we are, however,\r\nmuch in the same position as we were in the days of Read and Ralph; but\r\nability always was an unmarketable commodity, and now it seems to secure\r\nits unhappy possessors the decided enmity of those more favoured beings\r\nwhose dependence is upon patronage, and not upon personal powers, and\r\nwho, in humble imitation of the fox of fable, affect to despise any such\r\ncommon thing as cleverness. And unfortunately this observation has a far\r\nwider bearing than on the mere bestowal of titles. It refers to things\r\ngenerally, and to the means by which many clever men are deprived of\r\ntheir subsistence, and driven to the wall by the nepotism and friendly\r\nfeeling so often exercised in favour of the most arrant impostors, or on\r\nbehalf of those who are just clever enough to conceal their ignorance\r\nand inability, to rob others of their ideas, or to foist second-hand\r\nnotions upon a credulous and misjudging public.\r\n\r\nIn “A Journey through England,” published in 1723, we get the following\r\npicture of a travelling quack of that time: “I cannot leave Winchester\r\nwithout telling you of a pleasant incident that happened there. As I was\r\nsitting at the George Inn, I saw a coach with six bay horses, a calash\r\nand four, a chaise and four, enter the inn, in a yellow livery turned up\r\nwith red; four gentlemen on horseback, in blue trimmed with silver; and\r\nas yellow is the colour given by the dukes in England, I went out to see\r\nwhat duke it was; but there was no coronet on the coach, only a plain\r\ncoat-of-arms on each with this motto ‘_Argento laborat Faber_.’ Upon\r\ninquiry I found this great equipage belonged to a mountebank, and his\r\nname being Smith, the motto was a pun upon his name. The footmen in\r\nyellow were his tumblers and trumpeters, and those in blue his\r\nmerry-andrew, his apothecary and spokesman. He was dressed in black\r\nvelvet, and had in his coach a woman that danced on the ropes. He cures\r\nall diseases and sells his packets for sixpence apiece. He erected\r\nstages in all the market towns twenty miles round; and it is a prodigy\r\nhow so wise a people as the English are gulled by such pickpockets. But\r\nhis amusements on the stage are worth the sixpence without the pills. In\r\nthe morning he is dressed up in a fine brochade nightgown, for his\r\nchamber practice, when he gives advice and gets larger fees.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the papers of the early eighteenth century actually teem with\r\nthe advertisements of quacksalvers, few of the applications to the\r\nunwary possess any distinctive features, and those which do are of the\r\ngrossest possible description. In the _Daily Post_ of July 14, 1736,\r\nthere is a curious testimonial to the abilities of a City practitioner\r\nwho advertised very considerably about that period. His advertisements\r\nall take the form of recommendations from those who have received\r\nbenefit at his hands and from his medicines, and the one we have chosen\r\nwill give a fair idea of the others, which in many cases refer to the\r\ndisorders of the gentler sex:--\r\n\r\n  THESE are to certify, that I Richard Sandford, Waterman, dwelling in\r\n  Horsely-down-street, near the Dipping Pond, have a Son, who for a\r\n  considerable Time was troubled with a _Pain in his Stomach, a\r\n  Sleepiness and Giddiness_, whereupon I calling to Mind that some Years\r\n  since my Wife’s Mother, betwixt 60 and 70 years of Age, _afflicted\r\n  with a Palsy or Hemeplegia, or loss of the Use of one Side of her\r\n  Body, had been cured by_\r\n\r\n  _Mr._ JOHN MOORE, _Apothecary_,\r\n\r\n  _At the Pestle and Mortar in Laurence-Pountney’s Lane, the first Great\r\n  Gates on the Left-Hand from Cannon-street,_\r\n\r\n  I applied to him for Relief of my Son, who after having taken a few of\r\n  his Worm-Powders, they brought from him a WORM (or INSECT) like a\r\n  Hog-Louse, with Legs and hairy, or a Kind of Down all over it, and\r\n  very probably more, but he going to a common Vault they were lost;\r\n  upon which he is amended as to his former Illnesses, and I desire this\r\n  may be printed for the Good of others.\r\n\r\n  Witness\r\n\r\n  RICHARD SANDFORD.\r\n\r\n  _Oct. 6, 1735._\r\n\r\n  N.B. The said JOHN MOORE’S Worm Medicines and Green-Sickness Powder,\r\n  are sold at Mrs. Reader’s at the Nine Sugar-Loaves, a Chandler’s Shop\r\n  in Hungerford-Market, sealed with his Coat of Arms, being a Cross,\r\n  with the Words, _John Moore’s Worm-Powders_, &c., inscribed round it:\r\n  And if any are Sold at any place, except at his own House, without\r\n  that Seal and Inscription, they are Counterfeits.\r\n\r\n  He sells Byfield’s Sal Volatile Oliosum, at 6d. per Ounce.\r\n\r\n  To be had at the said J. Moore’s,\r\n\r\n  COLUMBARIUM; or, The Pigeon-House: Being an Introduction to a Natural\r\n  History of Tame Pigeons, giving an Account of the several Species\r\n  known in England, with the Method of breeding them, their Distempers\r\n  and Cures.\r\n\r\n  _The two chief Advantages, which a real Acquaintance with Nature\r\n  brings to our Minds, are first, by instructing our Understandings and\r\n  gratifying our Curiosities; and next by exciting and cherishing our\r\n  Devotion._\r\n\r\n  Boyle’s Experimental Philosophy, p. 3.\r\n\r\nMr Sandford’s ideas on natural history were rather confused, and his\r\npowers of description evidently bothered by the astonishing “insect”\r\nwhich had so annoyed his son. What a pity so curious a specimen was not\r\npreserved for the benefit of Moore and “the good of others”! There was\r\nnow a sore battle being fought between the quacks and the regular\r\npractitioners, the latter being bound to come forward and defend what\r\nthey considered to be their rights by all and every means. That they did\r\nnot disdain the use of advertisements, the following, which had its\r\norigin in a small gossiping paragraph, shows. It appears in the _Daily\r\nJournal_ of July 22, 1734, but was originally published a few days\r\nbefore, without the two paragraphs after signature:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS in the Papers of Saturday last there was a Paragraph relating\r\n  to a Dispute that happened at Child’s Coffee-house, between a Doctor\r\n  and a Surgeon; I think it my Duty to tell the Fact that occasioned\r\n  this Dispute, truly as it is.\r\n\r\n  On Wednesday the 10th of July I sent to Mr. Nourse; when he came I\r\n  told him I had a Swelling and great Pain in my Leg; he saw it, said it\r\n  was much inflamed, and that I must be blooded, take some Physick, and\r\n  that he would send something that was proper to be applied; I was\r\n  immediately let Blood; and he writ a Purge for me, to be taken the\r\n  next Day, which I took, and am thereby, I thank God, much better.\r\n  Afterwards, in the same Conversation, he ask’d me how long I had been\r\n  ill? my Answer was, ten Days; he reply’d, have you been ill so long,\r\n  and had no Advice? I then told him, I had, some Days before, been to\r\n  the Jew Doctor’s House; his Answer was, I suppose you mean Dr.\r\n  Schamberg, and pray what has he ordered for you? I said, I could not\r\n  tell; but being desirous that Dr. Nourse should see the Prescription,\r\n  I sent to the Apothecary’s for it by my Son, who brought it directly\r\n  into the Room, where there was not anybody but Mr. Nourse and myself;\r\n  Mr. Nourse looked upon the Bill, and told me I must take none of these\r\n  Things now; nor the Spaw Water, said I? (for that was Part of the\r\n  Prescription); his Answer was No, and laid the Bill down upon the\r\n  Table, without saying anything more. This is the whole Truth, and I’m\r\n  ready to attest it by an Affidavit.\r\n\r\n  N.B. When I sent to Mr. Nourse I was determined to apply no more to\r\n  Dr. Schamberg, he being in a manner a Stranger to me, and I have been\r\n  much worse every Day, from the Time I began to take his Medicines.\r\n\r\n  B. J. KNIGHT.\r\n\r\n  Leadenhall Market, 15 July.\r\n\r\n  The Propriety of Æsculapius’s Prescription judge of by the Effect.\r\n\r\n  Q. Whether Steel steep’d in Brandy, and Spa Water, are proper for a\r\n  Shortness of Breath, or an Inflammation.\r\n\r\nAfter this had been published once or twice, the advertiser, who could\r\nhardly have taken so much trouble out of pure gratitude, inserted\r\nanother notice in the form of an affidavit, containing the foregoing and\r\nother particulars, the most important of which is that which discovers\r\nher sex. At least we presume that Bridget was a woman’s name in 1734.\r\nThe difficulties between the doctors and apothecaries--the latter, when\r\nnot quacks themselves, being their special agents--and the demand made\r\nfor the far-famed Jesuits’ Bark, are both shown in the following\r\nhandbill, which is of about the same date as the foregoing:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS it has been of late the Endeavour of several Members of the\r\n  Physicians College, to reform the Abuses of the Apothecaries, as well\r\n  in the Prizes as in the Composition of their Medicines, This is to\r\n  give Notice for the public Good, that a superfine Sort of _Jesuits\r\n  Bark_ ready powder’d and paper’d into Doses, with or without\r\n  Directions for the Use of it, is to be had at Dr. Charles Goodal’s at\r\n  the Coach and Horses, in Physician’s Colledge in Warwick Lane, at 4s.\r\n  per Ounce, or for a Quantity together at £3 per Pound; for the\r\n  Reasonableness of which Prizes, (considering the Loss and Trouble in\r\n  powdering) we appeal to all the Druggists and Apothecaries themselves\r\n  in Town, and particularly to Mr. Thair, Druggist in Newgate Street, to\r\n  whom we paid full 9s. per Pound for a considerable Quantity for the\r\n  Use of our self and our friends.\r\n\r\n  And for the Excellency and Efficacy of this particular Bark enquire of\r\n  Dr. Morton in Grey Friars.\r\n\r\n  _I am to be spoken with at Prayers at_ S. Sepulchre’s every Day, _but\r\n  the Lord’s Day, at Seven in the Morning, and at Home from Eight in the\r\n  Morning till Ten at Night_.\r\n\r\n  _The Poor may have Advice_ (_that is_, Nothing) _for_ Nothing.\r\n\r\n“Nothing for nothing” is a rate of exchange which is current even to\r\nthis day, and was very likely known long before the time of this\r\nphysician, whose effort could hardly have been expected to prove\r\ndisastrous to the empirics, as he, among other peculiarities, regards\r\nwhat should have been his strong point of dissimilarity from them as\r\n“nothing.” Another bill of the same period is noticeable for the\r\nexplicitness of the address given in it:--\r\n\r\n  When you are in _Baldwin’s Gardens_, that you may not mistake, ask for\r\n  _Leopard’s Court_, and there at the Sign of the _Moon and Stars_, you\r\n  will find the _Louvain Doctor_ from 8 in the Morning till 7 at Night.\r\n  As you pass by the end of Leopard’s Court you may see the Sign of the\r\n  _Moon and Stars_, which, pray, observe, least you mistake: for there\r\n  are several Pretenders, therefore keep this bill. _Baldwin’s Gardens_\r\n  are near _Holborn_.\r\n\r\nBaldwin’s Gardens would hardly be a good address in these times for even\r\nthe veriest quack. It is now about the foulest specimen extant of that\r\nkind of backslum or alley where, a generation back, according to Hood,\r\npigs and Irish were wont to rally. The pigs, except in the form of\r\nhocks, “Jerry Lynch” heads, and other portions of bacon, have been\r\nremoved by Act of Parliament since the poet sang his simple lay of “The\r\nLost Child,” but the Irish have increased and multiplied with an\r\nactivity unknown to them in other pursuits. The powers of the finest\r\npeasantry in the world are undoubted in one particular of\r\nphiloprogenitiveness under any circumstances, and they seem to exert\r\nthem to the utmost when least required and most inconvenient--when they\r\nare “pigged up” in small rooms and festering courts, and when every\r\nfresh birth is an outrage upon the sanatory laws supposed to govern us,\r\nand upon their own sense of decency. We are in the habit of hearing most\r\nof our domestic and civic misfortunes ascribed to the higher wages and\r\nincreased leisure of the labouring classes of the present, as compared\r\nwith those of twenty or thirty years back. Is this the case with regard\r\nto the rapid development of inhabitants for Baldwin’s Gardens, Leather\r\nLane, Saffron Hill, and neighbouring purlieus? There may be increased\r\nleisure there, but if the wages are higher now than they were, in\r\nproportion to the higher price of provisions, they must have suffered\r\nworse than starvation in years gone by. So unhealthily crowded--in fact,\r\npestilent--is the neighbourhood we have mentioned, that no number of\r\nquacks could have done more to shorten life than the inhabitants now do\r\nfor themselves. But even these poor wretches are made the groundwork for\r\na new system of quackery--the quackery of the mock philanthropist, who\r\nbuilds model lodging-houses, ostensibly and with much flourishing of\r\ntrumpets, for the very poor, and then lets them to people who never did\r\ndwell in rookeries; to those people who can afford to pay good rents,\r\nand so keep up the dividends which are the modern reward of so-called\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the many stirring events of the early part of the last\r\ncentury, there is little or nothing to read in any of the papers. This\r\nmay be accounted for by the difficulty of obtaining news from distant or\r\neven from any parts a hundred and thirty years or so back; but whatever\r\nthe reason, this is certain, the advertisements are by far the best\r\nreading in the journals, daily or weekly. Though the newspapers were to\r\nour notions wonderfully small, their editors seem to have had the\r\ngreatest difficulty in filling the little space they had at command with\r\nnews, and provincial journals were sometimes put to strange shifts,\r\neven the now common work of the liner, that of inventing facts, being\r\nthen unknown. It is by no means unusual to find a chapter of the Bible\r\nput in to fill up the columns; and even as late as 1740 the _London and\r\nCounty Journal_ gratified its readers with the History of the Old and\r\nNew Testaments, while other papers filled up their front pages with\r\noccasional extracts from the histories of England and other countries,\r\nor selections from books of travel. Singular as this may seem, it is\r\ntrue. Its truth is perhaps the most singular thing about it.\r\n\r\nAmong the many specifics of the last century was snuff, which in various\r\nforms is advertised as possessing the power not only of curing all\r\nbodily but many mental evils. In the _General Advertiser_ for June 21,\r\n1749, there is an advertisement of a snuff which was supposed to cure\r\nlunacy. Certainly it has an effect on the ideas with regard to the\r\nconstruction of sentences, as the proprietor himself shows:--\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n  ONCE more I desire you to remember, I have published my _Imperial\r\n  Snuff_, for all Disorders in the Head; and I think I might have gone\r\n  further, and said, for all Disorders of Body and Mind. It hath set a\r\n  great many to rights that was never expected, but there is but few, or\r\n  none, that careth to have it published they were a little out of their\r\n  Senses, although it be really an Ailment that none can help; but there\r\n  is present Relief, if not a Cure; but I hope both, as by God’s\r\n  Assistance it hath been performed already on many. And I think it my\r\n  Duty to let the World know it, that they may not bear so many\r\n  miserable Ailments that is capable of curing. I hear it is reported\r\n  abroad I am dead, and that the World is imposed on; but, thank God, I\r\n  am alive and put my Dependance on him, that he will give me leave to\r\n  do some more Service before I go hence. But suppose I was dead, my\r\n  Snuff is alive, and I hope it will live after I am dead, as it is\r\n  capable of keeping the World in sprightly Life and Health, which must\r\n  be allowed to be the greatest Blessing in the World. But what is\r\n  Riches without that? And what would some have given for some of these\r\n  Reliefs before it was advertised. But you are all heartily welcome at\r\n  this Price of Sixpence, at present, but I should be glad of more from\r\n  the Rich. I do assure you it is sold at this Price in regard to the\r\n  Poor only.\r\n\r\n  I am yours, etc.\r\n\r\n  SAMUEL MAJOR.\r\n\r\n  _In Swedland Court, against the end of Half-Moon-Alley, Bishopsgate\r\n  Street._\r\n\r\nThe next gentleman upon the list is Mr Patence, who combined in himself\r\nmany valuable qualifications, and was according to his own showing a\r\ndecided benefactor to humanity. In December 1771 we find the following\r\nin the _Gazetteer_:--\r\n\r\n  MR Patence, Dentist and Dancing Master, No. 8, Bolt Court, Fleet\r\n  Street, whose Ingenuity in making artificial Teeth, and fixing them\r\n  without the least Pain, can be attested by several of the Nobility,\r\n  and hopes to be honoured by the rest of the Great--may depend his\r\n  Study shall be devoted to the good of every Individual. His whole\r\n  Sets, with a Fine enamel on, is a Proof of his excelling all\r\n  Operators. He charges ten Guineas for a whole, five for an upper or\r\n  under Set, and half-a-Guinea for a single Tooth.--His Rose Powder for\r\n  preserving the Teeth, is worthy to grace and perfume the chamber of a\r\n  Prince.--His Medicines for preventing all Infections and sore Throats\r\n  have been experienced by several.--As for dancing, he leaves that to\r\n  the multitude of Ladies and Gentlemen whom he has taught, and desires\r\n  to be rewarded no more than his Merit deserves, nor no less. Public\r\n  School nights, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday Evenings; Tuesday\r\n  Evenings set apart for Cotillons only.--_N.B._ His Rose Dentrifice may\r\n  be had at Mr Nesbit’s Toy Shop Bishopsgate Street, and at his House,\r\n  at 2s. 6d. the box.\r\n\r\nThe conjunction of practices seems somewhat odd, and, as many may think,\r\nrather ominous--for the patients. But Mr Patence evidently flourished,\r\nand found plenty money to spend in advertisements. He promises much, but\r\nhis strong point is secrecy. Advice is as usual offered gratis, which\r\nwas a fair charge for it, considering that the applicant was sure to be\r\nadvised to buy some of the nostrums purveyed by Patence. By his skill he\r\nrepeatedly offers to stand or fall, and about the date we have given he\r\npublishes the following as evidence of it. It will be noticed that the\r\naddress has been shifted, possibly on account of increased business:--\r\n\r\n  No. 3 _Ludgate Hill_.\r\n\r\n  THIS Week a Lady applied to Mr. _Patence_, No. 3 Ludgate Hill, who had\r\n  her Jaw-Bone broke by having a Tooth extracted, by another Lady, with\r\n  a sound front Tooth in her Hand, and two others just ready to drop\r\n  from their Sockets, by having four wretched artificial ones set in by\r\n  another: her Teeth are all loose. By Tincture, a Gentleman with Teeth\r\n  set in as brown as a Walnut, that never answered any End; and several\r\n  other Persons in different Cases. Mr. _Patence_ therefore begs leave\r\n  to add, that it is not his Intent to take away or lessen the Merit of\r\n  any one particular Person; but how shocking it is to see Ladies and\r\n  Gentlemen imposed on, a good set of Teeth ruined, and left at Leisure\r\n  to lament the Loss in Pain, by Pretenders; for, of all Things\r\n  artificial Teeth badly set in, is the most destructive of the good\r\n  next them: but if performed in that masterly Manner that human Nature\r\n  requires, they are a Preservation, and will answer the End which a\r\n  humane Man would wish for, or a skilful Dentist desire.--Advice given\r\n  daily in Cases ordinary, and extraordinary. No Cure no Pay.\r\n\r\nAfter this Patence goes on merrily telling us now that his “works,\r\ncures, and operations confirm his supremacy over every dentist in this\r\nkingdom; also physicians, curing man, woman, and child, when not one of\r\nthem can give relief;” and then that he sells “teeth comprised of six\r\ndifferent enamels, warranted never to turn black.” Teeth were, however,\r\nbut small things in his practice, as he guarantees to replace “fallen\r\nnoses” and challenges all known and unknown diseases, being, as he\r\nstates, “mechanically accurated and anatomically perfect in the human\r\nstructure.” To say less, he tells us, would be “doing an act unjust to\r\nhimself, his patients, and his Maker, whose gifts are disposed of to\r\nwhom he pleases.” In the _Morning Post_ of 1775 he publishes the\r\nfollowing, having in the meantime once again changed his residence:--\r\n\r\n  To the _Nobility_, _Gentry_, and Others.\r\n\r\n  PATENCE, Surgeon by Birth, and Dentist, having had ten Years Practice,\r\n  performs every Operation on the Teeth, Gums, &c., with superior Skill,\r\n  and whose Cures are not excelled or even equalled by any Dentist\r\n  whatever. And as a Confirmation of the same, please to observe the\r\n  following:--\r\n\r\n  October 5. A Gentleman who had lost all his Teeth, his Gums ulcerated\r\n  and scorbutic, in five Days made a perfect Cure, fixed him in a whole\r\n  set of natural Teeth, without Springs or any Fastening.\r\n\r\n  October 16. A Lady whose Jaw was fractured by a Barber, her Teeth\r\n  loose, her Gums ulcerated, attended with a running Matter, and an\r\n  inflammation in her Cheeks, with a callous Swelling, cured without\r\n  poulticing or cutting.\r\n\r\n  October 20. A Lady that had lost all her upper Teeth by using Powders\r\n  and Tinctures that are advertised to cure Everything, her Mouth\r\n  ulcerated, and her Breath nauseous, is now delicately Clean, and\r\n  replaced the Teeth with those that never change their Colour.\r\n\r\n  Sunday, October 29. Perfectly relieved a Person that had lost both\r\n  Palate and Speech; when he drank or eat it came out at his Nostrils,\r\n  and had been in that state three Years; he had applied to Surgeons and\r\n  several Hospitals, who deemed him incurable, and told him, one and\r\n  all, he could have no Relief; he now speaks articulate, eats and\r\n  drinks with Pleasure, which if any one should doubt, he can refer them\r\n  to the Man. These, with upwards of three thousand Operations and\r\n  Cures, have been accomplished by your humble Servant,\r\n\r\n  M. PATENCE.\r\n\r\n  At No. 403, in the Strand, near _Southampton Street_, London. Where\r\n  the Teeth, though ever so foul, are made delicately white in six\r\n  Minutes, and Medicines given for their preservation, for half a\r\n  Guinea, any hour after ten in the Morning. Advice gratis, and profound\r\n  Secrecy if required.\r\n\r\n  ☞ Envy may snarl, but superior Abilities assists the Afflicted.\r\n\r\nThere must be something very ambitious about a man who, not satisfied\r\nwith being dentist and dancing-master, assumes the title of “surgeon by\r\nbirth.” It is noticeable that though Patence was born a surgeon, he did\r\nnot discover it till he had been at dentistry and dancing for some\r\nyears.[37] But in 1775 and thereabouts quacks were not very particular\r\nas to their statements. In September 1776 the _Morning Post_ contains a\r\nvery lengthy advertisement, put forth by one Lattese, a Piedmontese,\r\nwho states that he has “by a long course of experiments discovered the\r\nwonderful secret of procreating either sex at the joint option of the\r\nparents. Should their desire be to have a girl, the success cannot be\r\nwarranted with absolute certainty, though the chances will be highly in\r\nfavour of such an event; but should they concur in their wishes to have\r\na son, they may rely that by strictly conforming to a few easy and\r\nnatural directions, they will positively have a boy.” Mr Lattese is so\r\nsatisfied with the result of his experience that he is satisfied to\r\nawait the result, and, no satisfaction, no pay. However much we may have\r\nadvanced in some directions since the days of Patence and\r\nLattese--though we now have railroads, steamboats, tramways, electric\r\ntelegraphs, a penny post, vote by ballot, asphalt pavement, and\r\ngood-templarism--it must be admitted that we have, in grasping at mere\r\nbubbles, lost many true arts. Among those unfortunately forgotten must,\r\nwe are sorry to assume, be ranked those of breeding boys at will and\r\nsurgeons _à discretion_.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how anxious many of the quacks are that they shall not be\r\nconfounded with their rivals, and their addresses are often given with\r\nwonderful exactness. Of this we will add another example, which, though\r\nsome years later than the one about Baldwin’s Gardens, is in no way less\r\ndistinct. It would seem, from many references in old newspapers, that\r\nthe term Maypole was used for a certain portion of the Strand long after\r\nthe shaft itself had been removed:--\r\n\r\n  In the Strand, over against the Maypole, on the left Hand coming from\r\n  Temple-Bar, at the Sign of the Golden Cross, between a Sword Cuttlers\r\n  and a Milliner’s Shop, the Sign of the Sugar Loaf and Barber’s Pole,\r\n  within four Doors of the Mitre Tavern: Where you may see a large Red\r\n  coloured Lanthorn, with Eleven Candles in it; and a white Sign written\r\n  upon with red Letters DUTCH DOCTOR, ^Licensed by his most Excellent\r\n  Majesty^: and a long Entry with a Hatch and a Knocker on it. Where you\r\n  may come in privately, and speak with him, and need not be ashamed, he\r\n  having not any in his House but himself and his Family.\r\n\r\nThe sign of the Sugar-loaf and Barber’s Pole must have been unique even\r\nin the days of signboards, when incongruity was an advantage. Signs\r\nremind us of a noted quack of last century, Van Butchell, who painted a\r\nwonderful inscription over the front of his house. He was a great\r\nadvertiser, too, and his effusions are found in most of the papers. When\r\nhis wife died he had her embalmed, and used to let his patients see the\r\nbody. He made her very useful as a means of publicity, one of his\r\nnotices--in the _St James’s Chronicle_ for October 1776--running thus:--\r\n\r\n  VAN BUTCHELL (not willing to be unpleasantly circumstanced, and\r\n  wishing to convince some good Minds they have been misinformed)\r\n  acquaints the Curious no Stranger can see his embalmed Wife, unless\r\n  (by a Friend or personally) introduced to himself, any Day between\r\n  Nine and One, Sundays excepted.\r\n\r\nVan Butchell, though he lost no opportunity of looking after the main\r\nchance, had a mad way of conducting his business, which caused people to\r\nregard him as quite out of the ordinary level of charlatans, and his\r\neccentricities in time got him a reputation for both cleverness and\r\nconscientiousness. He lived in Mount Street, and on his house and part\r\nof the next the following strange inscription was painted:--\r\n\r\n                                     BY\r\n                                HIS MAJESTY’S\r\n  Thus, said sneaking Jack,         ROYAL      speaking like himself,\r\n  I’ll be first; if I get my Money,            I don’t care who suffers.\r\n                               LETTERS PATENT,\r\n                                   MARTIN\r\n                               VAN BUTCHELL’S\r\n                                NEW INVENTED\r\n\r\n                        With caustic care--and old Phim.\r\n\r\n                                SPRING BANDS\r\n                               AND FASTENINGS\r\n\r\n      Sometimes in six days, and always in ten--the Fistula in Ano.\r\n\r\n                                    FOR\r\n                                THE APPAREL\r\n                               AND FURNITURE\r\n                                  July 6.\r\n                                     OF\r\n                    Licensed to deal in Perfumery, i.e.\r\n                               HUMAN BEINGS\r\n                     Hydrophobia cured in thirty days.\r\n                                    AND\r\n                             BRUTE CREATURES.\r\n                          Made of Milk and Honey.\r\n\r\nHis next-door neighbour, however, thinking proper to rebuild part of his\r\nfront, obliterated half of the notice, which, as remarked, ran across\r\nboth houses. At one time Van Butchell had a famous dun horse, and having\r\nsome dispute with the stable-keeper, it was detained by the latter to\r\npay for his keep, and was at length sold at Tattersall’s, where, from\r\nthe character given him by Van Butchell, he brought a good price. This\r\naffair was the occasion of a lawsuit, and caused the Doctor to add in\r\nsmall gold letters as quoted, nearly at the top of his notice, the\r\nwords, “Thus said sneaking Jack,” &c. Of Van Butchell’s literary and\r\nadvertising talents, the reader will be best able to form a conclusion\r\nafter a perusal of the following specimen, taken from various newspapers\r\nat various times:--\r\n\r\n  Causes of Crim.

His notoriety was such that many used to visit\r\nhis house, not so much for the purpose of receiving advice as to see and\r\nconverse with him. The success which he and contemporary quacks made\r\nled to the tax on “patent medicines,” which was imposed in 1783, and has\r\nnow for over ninety years been a fruitful source of revenue. Of Van\r\nButchell’s contemporaries, one of the most worthy of note was\r\nKaterfelto, of whom Cowper speaks in “The Task”--\r\n\r\n    And Katerfelto, with his hair an end\r\n    At his own wonders, wondering for his bread.\r\n\r\nKaterfelto was a foreigner who had “seen service,” and according to his\r\nown showing was both brave and learned. A notice of him which appears in\r\nan article on quacks says: “In a pamphlet on quackery, published at\r\nKingston-upon-Hull, in 1805, it is stated that Dr Katerfelto practised\r\non the people of London in the influenza of 1782; that he added to his\r\nnostrums the fascinations of hocus-pocus; and that with the services of\r\nsome extraordinary _black cats_ he astonished the vulgar. In 1790, or\r\n1791, he visited the city of Durham, accompanied by his wife and\r\ndaughter. His travelling equipage consisted of an old rumbling coach,\r\ndrawn by a pair of sorry hacks; and his two black servants wore green\r\nliveries with red collars. They were sent round the town, blowing\r\ntrumpets and delivering bills of their master’s performances. These\r\nwere--in the daytime, a microscope; in the evening, electrical\r\nexperiments, in which the black cats--‘the doctor’s devils’--played\r\ntheir parts in yielding electric sparks; tricks of legerdemain concluded\r\nthe entertainments. He was a tall, thin man, dressed in a black gown and\r\nsquare cap; he is said to have been originally a soldier in the Prussian\r\nservice. In one of his advertisements he states that he was a colonel in\r\nthe ‘Death’s Head’ regiment of hussars, a terrific prognostic of his\r\nultimate profession. He had many mishaps in his conjuring career; once\r\nhe sent up a fire balloon, which, falling upon a hay-stack, set it on\r\nfire, and it was consumed, when Katerfelto was sued for its value, and\r\nwas sent to prison in default of payment. And not long before his\r\ndeath, he was committed by the Mayor of Shrewsbury to the House of\r\nCorrection in that city as a vagrant and impostor. Katerfelto mixed up\r\nwith his quackery some real science, and by the aid of the solar\r\nmicroscope astonished the world with insect wonders. In one of his\r\nadvertisements in the _Morning Post_, of July 1782, he says that, by its\r\naid, the insects on the hedges will be seen larger than ever, and those\r\ninsects which caused the late influenza will be seen as large as a bird;\r\nand in a drop of water the size of a pin’s head there will be seen above\r\n50,000 insects; the same in beer, milk, vinegar, blood, flour, cheese,\r\netc., etc., and there will be seen many surprising indifferent\r\nvegetables, and above 200 other dead objects. He obtained good prices\r\nfor his show:--‘The admittance to see these wonderful works of\r\nProvidence is only--front seats, three shillings; second seats, two\r\nshillings; and back seats, one shilling only, from eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning till six in the afternoon, at No. 22 Piccadilly.’ He fully\r\nunderstood the advantages of puffing, and one of his advertisements\r\ncommences with a story of ‘a gentleman of the faculty belonging to\r\nOxford University, who, finding it likely to prove a fine day, set out\r\nfor London purposely to see those great wonders which are advertised so\r\nmuch by that famous philosopher, Mr Katerfelto;’ that the said gentleman\r\ndeclared, ‘if he had come three hundred miles on purpose, the knowledge\r\nhe had then received would amply reward him; and that he should not\r\nwonder that some of the nobility should come from the remotest part of\r\nScotland to hear Mr Katerfelto, as the people of that country in\r\nparticular are always searching after knowledge.’ He elsewhere declares\r\nhimself ‘the greatest philosopher in this kingdom since Sir Isaac\r\nNewton.’ ‘And Mr Katerfelto, as a divine and moral philosopher, begs\r\nleave to say that all persons on earth live in darkness, if they are\r\nable to see, but will not see his wonderful exhibition.’” Katerfelto,\r\nwho had been in trouble both in his own country and in France, showed an\r\naptitude for distinguishing himself in a similar way here, not only in\r\nthe ways we have already quoted, but with regard to impositions\r\npractised on the confiding. He obtained £2000 from a Captain Paterson,\r\nbut had to return it. This he afterwards referred to as instance of his\r\ngenerosity and love of honesty, and his admiration for this country is\r\nshown by his avowed desire to stay in it, “though unpensioned,\r\nnotwithstanding the many offers from the Queen of France, the request of\r\nhis friend and correspondent Dr Franklin, and the positive commands of\r\nhis liege lord the King of Prussia.”\r\n\r\nMention of the Queen of France reminds us of another impostor, perhaps\r\nthe greatest in his way that ever lived, Joseph Balsamo. As, however, he\r\nhad little or nothing to do with advertising, and as he has already\r\nafforded work for many able and vigorous pens, we will be content to\r\nquote a few lines from Carlyle regarding the arch-quack’s description\r\nand personal appearance: “The quack of quacks, the most perfect\r\nscoundrel that in these latter ages has marked the world’s history, we\r\nhave found in the Count Alessandro di Cagliostro, pupil of the sage\r\nAlthotas, foster child of the Scherif of Mecca, probably son of the last\r\nking of Trebizonde; named also Acharat, and unfortunate child of nature;\r\nby profession healer of diseases, abolisher of wrinkles, friend of the\r\npoor and impotent, grand-master of the Egyptian mason-lodge of high\r\nscience, spirit-summoner, gold-cook, grand cophta, prophet, priest, and\r\nthaumaturgic moralist and swindler; really a liar of the first\r\nmagnitude, thorough-paced in all provinces of lying, what one may call\r\nthe king of liars. . . . One of the most authentic documents preserved\r\nof Joseph Balsamo is the picture of his visage. An effigy once\r\nuniversally diffused in oil paint, aquatint, marble, stucco, and perhaps\r\ngingerbread, decorating millions of apartments. Fittest of visitors,\r\nworthy to be worn by the quack of quacks! A most portentous face of\r\nscoundrelism: a fat, snub, abominable face; dew-lapped, flat-nosed,\r\ngreasy, full of greediness, sensuality, ox-like obstinacy; a forehead\r\nimpudent, refusing to be ashamed; and then two eyes turned up\r\nseraphically languishing, as if in divine contemplation and adoration; a\r\ntouch of quiz, too; on the whole, perhaps the most perfect quack-face\r\nproduced by the eighteenth century.” The subject of this flattering\r\nportrait was born in 1743, and died in the fortress of St Leo, Rome,\r\nafter an imprisonment of six years, aged fifty-two.\r\n\r\nThe system of showing on oneself the effect of one’s own specifics has\r\nhad many admirers and practisers. A Mrs Harden, in Newman Street, Oxford\r\nStreet, used to advertise some years ago a hair-dye, the effect of which\r\nwas to be seen on her own hair at her private residence, or at ladies’\r\nown residences if preferred. In a similar manner a quack in the time of\r\nKing Charles II. commenced his handbill with this statement: “Salvator\r\nWinter, an Italian of the city of Naples, aged 98 years, yet by the\r\nblessing of God, finds himself in health and as strong as any one of\r\nfifty, as to the sensitive part. Which first he attributes to God, and\r\nthen to his _Elixir Vitæ_, which he always carries in his pocket adayes,\r\nand at night under his pillow. And when he finds himself distempered he\r\ntaketh a spoonful or two, according as need requireth.” He then goes on\r\nto state that people should call and see its effect on him, and purchase\r\nso as to ensure health.\r\n\r\nA most original, unique, and successful humbug, quite worthy of mention\r\nhere, though not a dealer in medicines, was the late Monsieur Mangin of\r\nParis. While passing through the public streets, there was nothing in\r\nhis personal appearance to distinguish him from any ordinary gentleman.\r\nHe drove a pair of bay horses, attached to an open carriage with two\r\nseats, the back one always occupied by his valet. Sometimes he would\r\ntake up his stand in the Champs Elysées; at other times near the column\r\nin the Place Vendôme; but usually he was seen in the afternoon in the\r\nPlace de la Bastille, or the Place de la Madeleine. On Sundays his\r\nfavourite locality was the Place de la Bourse. Mangin was a\r\nwell-formed, stately-looking individual, with a most self-satisfied\r\ncountenance, which seemed to say, “I am master here; and all that my\r\nauditors have to do is, to listen and obey.” Arriving at his destined\r\nstopping-place, his carriage halted. His servant handed him a case from\r\nwhich he took several large portraits of himself, which he hung\r\nprominently upon the sides of his carriage, and also placed in front of\r\nhim a vase filled with medals bearing his likeness on one side, and a\r\ndescription of the blacklead pencils in which he traded on the other. He\r\nthen leisurely commenced a change of costume. His round hat was replaced\r\nby a magnificent burnished helmet, mounted with rich plumes of various\r\nbrilliant colours. His overcoat was laid aside, and he donned in its\r\nstead a costly velvet tunic with gold fringes. He then drew a pair of\r\npolished steel gauntlets upon his hands, covered his breast with a\r\nbrilliant cuirass, and placed a richly-mounted sword at his side. His\r\nservant watched him closely, and upon receiving a sign from his master\r\nhe too put on his official costume, which consisted of a velvet robe and\r\na helmet. The servant then struck up a tune on the richly-toned organ\r\nwhich always formed a part of Mangin’s apparatus. The grotesque\r\nappearance of these individuals, and the music, soon drew together an\r\nadmiring crowd. Then the charlatan stood up. His manner was calm,\r\ndignified, imposing, indeed, almost solemn, for his face was as serious\r\nas that of the chief mourner at a funeral. His sharp, intelligent eye\r\nscrutinised the throng which was pressing around his carriage, until it\r\nrested apparently upon some particular individual, then he gave a start;\r\nthen, with a dark, angry expression, as if the sight was repulsive, he\r\nabruptly dropped the visor of his helmet and thus covered his face from\r\nthe gaze of the anxious crowd. Thus far he had not spoken a word. At\r\nlast the prelude ended, and the comedy commenced. Stepping forward again\r\nto the front of the carriage, he exclaimed--“Gentlemen, you look\r\nastonished! You seem to wonder and ask yourselves, who is this modern\r\nQuixote? What mean this costume of bygone centuries--this golden\r\nchariot--these richly-caparisoned steeds? What is the name, what the\r\npurpose of this curious knight-errant? Gentlemen, I will condescend to\r\nanswer your queries. I am Monsieur Mangin, the great charlatan of\r\nFrance! Yes, gentlemen, I am a charlatan--a mountebank; it is my\r\nprofession, not from choice, but from necessity. You, gentlemen, created\r\nthat necessity! You would not patronise true, unpretending, honest\r\nmerit, but you are attracted by my glittering casque, my sweeping crest,\r\nmy waving plumes. You are captivated by din and glitter, and therein\r\nlies my strength. Years ago I hired a modest shop in the Rue Rivoli, but\r\nI could not sell pencils enough to pay my rent, whereas, by assuming\r\nthis disguise--it is nothing else--I have succeeded in attracting\r\ngeneral attention, and in selling literally millions of my pencils; and\r\nI assure you, there is at this moment scarcely an artist in France or in\r\nGreat Britain who does not know that I manufacture by far the best\r\nblacklead pencils ever seen.” And Mangin so far differed from other\r\nmountebanks in the fact that his wares were everywhere said to be\r\nsuperior to any others.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Mangin reminds us of another French itinerant who forms the\r\ncentral figure of a rather amusing story. In July 1817 a man of imposing\r\nfigure, wearing a large sabre and immense moustache, arrived at one of\r\nthe principal inns of a provincial city in France, with a female of\r\nagreeable shape and enchanting mien. He alighted at the moment the\r\ndinner was being served up at the _table d’hôte_. His martial appearance\r\nand bearing caused all the guests to rise with respect; they felt\r\nassured he must be a lieutenant-general or a major-general at least. A\r\nnew governor was expected in the province about this time, and everybody\r\nbelieved that it was he who had arrived incognito. The officer of _gens\r\nd’armes_ gave him the place of honour, the comptroller of the customs\r\nand the receiver of taxes sat each by the side of madame, and exerted\r\ntheir wit and gallantry to the utmost. All the tit-bits, all the most\r\nexquisite wines, were placed before the fortunate couple. At length the\r\nparty broke up, and every one ran to report through the city that M. le\r\nGouverneur had arrived. But, oh, what was their surprise, when the next\r\nday his Excellency, clad in a scarlet coat, and his august companion,\r\ndressed out in a gown glittering with tinsel, mounted a small open\r\ncalash, and preceded by some musicians, went about the squares and\r\npublic ways selling Swiss tea and balm of Mecca! Imagine the fury of the\r\nguests! They complained to the _maire_, and demanded that the audacious\r\nquack should be compelled to lay aside the characteristic mark of the\r\nbrave. The prudent magistrate assembled the common council; and those\r\nrespectable persons, after a long deliberation, considering that nothing\r\nin the charter forbad a citizen to let his beard grow on his upper lip,\r\ndismissed the complaint altogether. The same evening the supposed\r\ngovernor gave a serenade to the offended diners, and the next day took\r\nhis leave, and continued his journey amid the acclamations of the\r\npopulace.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know what quack--for a quack it certainly\r\nmust have been--was first responsible for the belief that a child’s caul\r\nwould save a man from drowning. The origin of this fiction is, however,\r\nhidden under the dust of ages. It is customary for people who assume\r\nwhat they wish to believe, to state that the superstition went out when\r\neducation came in; but that such is not the case a perusal of the\r\nadvertisement sheets of current journals will show. Here is a rather\r\ncurious specimen of a generation ago:--\r\n\r\n  A CHILD’S CAUL to be disposed of, particularly recommended to persons\r\n  going to the Continent on pleasure or business, officers in his\r\n  Majesty’s navy, merchants trading to the East and West Indies, and all\r\n  other parts of the globe, being exposed to the dangers of the seas,\r\n  having the caul in their possession their life will most assuredly\r\n  always be preserved. Address by letter only, prepaid, to Mr W., Temple\r\n  Chambers, Falcon Court, Fleet Street.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the demand for these extremely portable\r\nlife-preservers has quite gone so far as advertisements are concerned,\r\nall that we have seen of modern years being in reference to cauls that\r\nthe owners wished to part with. When these preventives were fully\r\nbelieved in, an ancient mariner must have been as much surprised as\r\nafraid when he went down to the bottom. Captain Marryat tells a rather\r\nfunny story of a pair of canvas inexpressibles that refused to sink\r\nbecause they had a caul in one of the pockets; and in the days of Howe,\r\nCollingwood, and Nelson, a rare trade was driven in cauls, real and\r\nimitation, which then fetched fancy prices.\r\n\r\nThe motives will be apparent which prevent our entering on the merits\r\nand demerits of quacks and quack medicines of the present day. Some of\r\nthe latter are doubtless concocted with skill, and, under peculiar\r\ncircumstances, are productive of much good, while others are quite the\r\nreverse in all particulars. Into this subject we cannot go, as we have\r\nno wish to advertise any one nostrum at the expense of another, or to\r\nsubject ourselves to the expense and unpleasantness which too often\r\nattends on outspokenness. We shall rest content with the facts that the\r\nmost impudent empirics confine themselves to “certain diseases” and\r\nhole-and-corner advertisements, and that analytical chemists and\r\ncomparatively recent legislation have provided for us remedies for any\r\nexcess on the part of the patent-medicine manufacturers, any one of whom\r\na single false step would irretrievably ruin. Besides, the curious need\r\nlook no further than the current newspapers for any quantity of average\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGraham and his Celestial Bed are worthy of a chapter to themselves,\r\nespecially as we have already run to such length on the subject of\r\nquacks and quackery.\r\n\r\n  [37] After all Patence was only an imitator in this particular. In the\r\n  _Gentleman’s Magazine_ of 1735, there is a reference to the “Unborn\r\n  Doctor of Moorfields,” who flourished very early in the eighteenth\r\n  century. This man upon being asked to explain his mysterious title,\r\n  replied, “Why, I wasn’t born a doctor, was I?”\r\n\r\n  [38] This refers to the regular mode of eminent Surgeons, who seldom\r\n  cut for Fistulæ or Piles, but in the presence of their assistants:\r\n  because some patients have died under the operation, and others some\r\n  days after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n_GRAHAM AND HIS CELESTIAL BED._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1775 there commenced practice in London one of the most\r\nextraordinary empirics of any time, whose name was Graham. He was the\r\nson of a saddler in the Cowgate, Edinburgh, where he was born in 1745.\r\nHaving graduated as a doctor of medicine at the University of the modern\r\nAthens, he practised for some time at Pontefract. After a short\r\nresidence in that town, Dr Graham went to America, where he figured as a\r\nphilanthropic physician, travelling for the benefit of mankind, to\r\nadminister relief in the most desperate diseases to patients whose cases\r\nhad hitherto puzzled ordinary physicians. And here he picked up a deal\r\nof experience, which he put to the test on his return. Having the\r\nadvantage of a handsome person, a polite address, an agreeable\r\nconversation, and great fluency of speech, he obtained admission into\r\nthe first circles, particularly in New England, where, as he himself\r\nstated, he reaped “golden opinions.” Returning to England, he made an\r\nexcursion through the country, and according to his own account, was\r\neminently successful in curing many individuals whose cases had been\r\nconsidered desperate. In 1775 Graham settled in London, opening a house\r\nin Pall Mall, “nearly opposite the King’s Palace,” where he devoted his\r\nattention specially to disorders of the ear and eye, and inserted\r\nadvertisements to that effect in the daily papers. These advertisements,\r\nthough by no means couched in so bombastic a style as Graham’s later\r\nproductions, still have an undeniable spice of quackery about them.\r\nThey are, however, rather too lengthy for insertion. One of them which\r\nappeared on February 9, 1776, after stating that from motives of\r\ndelicacy the Doctor made it an invariable rule never on any account to\r\nmention the cure, however extraordinary, of any person, poor or rich,\r\ngives the following particulars of his practice:--\r\n\r\n  Dr Graham began to practise in London, Feb. 1, 1775, and the following\r\n  is the general state of his Practice in disorders of the Eye and Ear:\r\n  from that time to November 1, being a period of nine Months, cures or\r\n  relieved 281; refused as incurable on their first Application, 317;\r\n  after a short Trial (by desire) found incurable 47; dismissed for\r\n  Neglect, etc. 57; country, foreign, and other Patients, events\r\n  unknown, 381.\r\n\r\nAfter residing in London for some time, he visited Scotland, and was\r\nemployed by people of the first quality, who were tempted to put\r\nthemselves under his care by the fascination of his manner and the fame\r\nof his wondrous cures. So popular was he that he might have settled in\r\nEdinburgh to great advantage, but he preferred returning to England. He\r\nfixed his abode in London, where he set on foot one of the most original\r\nand extravagant institutions that could well be imagined, the object of\r\nwhich was, according to the _ipsissima verba_ of one of the Doctor’s\r\nadvertisements, “the propagation of a much more strong, beautiful,\r\nactive, healthy, wise, and virtuous race of human beings, than the\r\npresent puny, insignificant, foolish, peevish, vicious, and nonsensical\r\nrace of Christians, who quarrel, fight, bite, devour, and cut one\r\nanother’s throat about they know not what.” The idea was original and\r\nsingular in the highest degree; but he founded his hopes on a perfect\r\nknowledge of human nature, and the success which attended his experiment\r\nproved that he had calculated with judgment. It has been assumed by some\r\nthat he really believed in his own statements. That must have been the\r\nresult of repeating them so often, and in this particular he was by no\r\nmeans singular. In May 1779 he opened what he called “The Temple of\r\nHealth” in the Adelphi, the purposes of which may be best understood\r\nfrom one of his advertisements which appeared in the _Morning Herald_\r\nand other newspapers pretty constantly between 1778 and 1781:--\r\n\r\n  TEMPLE OF HEALTH, Adelphi.\r\n\r\n  To their Excellencies the Foreign Ambassadors, to the Nobility,\r\n  Gentry, and to Persons of Learning and of Taste.\r\n\r\n  By Particular Desire, the Exhibitions at the TEMPLE of HEALTH will be\r\n  continued as usual every TUESDAY, THURSDAY, and SATURDAY Evenings,\r\n  till the TEMPLE of HYMEN be opened, which will be announced in the\r\n  Public Papers.\r\n\r\n  THE CELESTIAL BRILLIANCY of the Medico-Electrical Apparatus in all the\r\n  apartments of the Temple, will be exhibited\r\n\r\n  By Dr. GRAHAM himself\r\n\r\n  Who will have the honour of explaining the true Nature and Effects of\r\n  Electricity, Air, Music, and Magnetism when applied to the Human Body.\r\n\r\n  In the Introductory Oration, the whole Art of enjoying Health and\r\n  vigour of Body and of Mind, and of preserving and exalting personal\r\n  beauty and loveliness; or in other words of living with Health,\r\n  Honour, and Happiness, in this world for at least an hundred years, is\r\n  pointed out and warmly inculcated. Previous to the display of the\r\n  Electrical Fire, the Doctor will delicately touch upon the CELESTIAL\r\n  BEDS which are soon to be opened in the Temple of Hymen, in Pall Mall,\r\n  for the propagation of Beings, rational and far stronger and more\r\n  beautiful in mental as well as in bodily Endowments, than the present\r\n  puny, feeble and nonsensical race of Christians--probationary\r\n  immortals, which crawl and fret, and cut one anothers throat for\r\n  nothing at all, on most parts of this terraqueous globe.\r\n\r\n  This Apparatus which visibly displays, as it were, the various\r\n  facilities of the material Soul of universal and eternal Nature, is\r\n  acknowledged by all who have seen it, to be by far the largest, most\r\n  useful and most magnificent that now is or that ever was in the world.\r\n  Admittance 5s.\r\n\r\n  But in order that Persons of every Rank may have a View of this most\r\n  magnificent Apparatus, the Temple of Health may be viewed every Day\r\n  this Week, from two o’Clock in the Afternoon till eight at Night.\r\n  Admittance 1s.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--A Pamphlet is now published, (by permission) with the\r\n  particulars of several hundred Cures in confirmed Diseases, lately\r\n  performed at the Temple of Health, with the Names and Residence of the\r\n  Patients, at their own particular Desire, to be had of the Porter at\r\n  the Temple, price only 3d.\r\n\r\nAs a further attraction to his establishment, Graham secured the\r\nservices of a beautiful young woman, whom he styled “Vestina, the Rosy\r\nGoddess of Health,” who presided over the evening lectures, and,\r\naccording to the advertisements, assisted “at the display of the\r\nCelestial Meteors, and of that sacred Vital Fire over which she watches,\r\nand whose application in the cure of diseases, she daily has the honour\r\nof directing.” The lady who acted this part subsequently became\r\nnotorious as the wife of Sir William Hamilton, ambassador to the Court\r\nof Naples. Her name was Emma Hart, and before she was raised to the\r\ndignity of Goddess of Health, she had officiated in the more humble\r\ncapacity of nursery and lady’s maid in gentlemen’s families. Eventually,\r\nafter having sat as model to Romney and other painters, and having lived\r\nunder the protection of different gentlemen, she was finally married in\r\n1791 at St George’s, Hanover Square, to Sir William Hamilton. Her\r\nsubsequent connection with Lord Nelson, and her power over that great\r\nnaval hero but weak human being, as well as the humiliating positions in\r\nwhich she placed her dotard of a husband, form part of the history of\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nIn another of his advertisements Graham offers to explain “the whole art\r\nof enjoying health and vigour of body and mind, and of preserving and\r\nexalting personal beauty and loveliness; or, in other words, of living\r\nwith health, honour, and happiness in this world, for at least a hundred\r\nyears.” One of the means for ensuring this end was the constant use of\r\nmud baths; and that the Doctor might be observed to practise what he\r\npreached, he was to be seen, on stated occasions, immersed in mud to the\r\nchin, accompanied by Vestina, who had only then recently left off\r\nnursing children and attending on ladies. Her beauty attracted general\r\nattention, and brought Graham a deal of practice. While she remained in\r\nthe mud bath, she had her hair elaborately dressed in the prevailing\r\nfashion, with powder, flowers, feathers, and ropes of pearls; Graham\r\nappearing in an equally elaborate wig.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1781 the Temple of Health was removed to Schomberg\r\nHouse (now the Ordnance Office), Pall Mall, and the “Temple of Hymen”\r\nand “Celestial Bed” were exhibited to the gaze of the profane and the\r\ncurious. Altogether the establishment was of a very extraordinary\r\ndescription. The front was ornamented with an enormous gilt sun, a\r\nstatue of Hygieia, and other attractive emblems; the suites of rooms\r\nwere superbly furnished, and the walls decorated with mirrors, so as to\r\nconfer on the place an effect like that of an enchanted palace. All the\r\nexertions of the painter and sculptor, all the enchantments of vocal and\r\ninstrumental music, all the powers of electricity and magnetism, were\r\ncalled into operation to enliven and heighten the scene. In a word, all\r\nthat could delight the eye or ravish the ear, all that could please the\r\nsmell, give poignancy to the taste, or gratify the touch, were combined\r\nto give effect to the whole--at least such was his own account. As a\r\nfurther means of attraction, he hired two men of extraordinary stature,\r\ntwo sons of Anak, whom he appareled in showy and startling liveries, and\r\neach of whom wore an enormous cocked-hat, whose business it was to\r\ndistribute bills from house to house through the town. These handbills\r\nwere curiously suggestive of the wonderful Doctor’s general bombastic\r\nstyle. Here is one of them:--\r\n\r\n  _Temple of Health and of Hymen. Pall Mall._\r\n\r\n  THE LECTURE at the above place having been received by very numerous,\r\n  polite and brilliant audiences of Ladies and Gentlemen with unbounded\r\n  applause, it will be repeated This and every Evening this Week; and\r\n  precisely at 8 o’clock the Gentleman Usher of the Rosy Rod, assisted\r\n  by the High Priestess, will conduct the rosy, the gigantic, the\r\n  stupendous Goddess of Health to the Celestial Throne.\r\n\r\n  The blooming PRIESTESS of the TEMPLE will endeavour to entertain\r\n  Ladies and Gentlemen of candour and good nature, by reading a Lecture\r\n  on the simplest and most efficacious means of preserving health,\r\n  beauty, and personal loveliness, and serene mental brilliancy, even to\r\n  the extremest old age.\r\n\r\n  VESTINA, the GIGANTIC! on the Celestial Throne, as the Goddess of\r\n  Health, will exhibit in her own person, a proof of the all-blessing\r\n  effects of virtue, temperance, regularity, simplicity, and moderation;\r\n  and in these luxurious, artificial, and effeminate times, to recommend\r\n  those great virtues.\r\n\r\n  The Temple (which exhibits more riches, more elegance, and more\r\n  brilliancy than any royal Palace in the world) will as usual be\r\n  sweetly illuminated with wax, in the highest, most dazzling, and most\r\n  celestial magnificence from 7 till 10 o’clock, This evening and every\r\n  Evening this week, and the Lecture will begin precisely at eight. Both\r\n  before and after the Lecture, one of Vestina’s Fairy Train will warble\r\n  forth sweet celestial sounds.--_Admittance only_ ONE SHILLING.\r\n\r\n  The magnificent Electrical Apparatus, and the supremely brilliant and\r\n  _unique_ decorations of this magical Edifice--of this enchanting\r\n  Elysian Palace! where wit and mirth, love and beauty--all that can\r\n  delight the soul, and all that can ravish the senses, will hold their\r\n  court, This and every Evening this week, in chaste and joyous\r\n  assemblage.\r\n\r\n  ⁂ Ladies of rank and character are assured, that nothing will be said\r\n  or seen, which can give even the smallest offence to the chastest and\r\n  most delicate female eye or ear, and that every thing will be\r\n  conducted with the most perfect decency and decorum.--Ladies are\r\n  requested to come early, in order that they may be agreeably\r\n  accommodated with seats.\r\n\r\n  ⁂ A very few copies still remaining of Dr. Graham’s Private Advisers\r\n  (_sealed up, price One Guinea_) to those Ladies and Gentlemen who wish\r\n  to have children, or to become snowy pillars of Health and Beauty,\r\n  studded as it were with roses, and streaked with celestial blue, may\r\n  now be had at only Half a Guinea; his other curious and eccentric\r\n  works, containing full descriptions of his Travels, Discoveries,\r\n  Improvements, Principles, Cures, Electrical Apparatus, etc.--formerly\r\n  3s. 6d., now only 1s. 9d., and VESTINA, the rosy Goddess’s warm\r\n  Lecture, price 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n  ☞ All Dr. Graham’s Medicines to be had as usual, at the Temple of\r\n  Health.\r\n\r\n  Note. Ladies and Gentlemen Electrified.\r\n\r\nAll went well for a time, and the Temple was nightly crowded with silly\r\npeople who paid their half-guineas, for the shilling of the\r\nadvertisements only just admitted to the “body of the hall.” Sometimes\r\nthere were magnificent illuminations and Elysian promenades for both\r\nladies and gentlemen, to which persons in masks were also admitted. “The\r\nenchanting glory of these seemingly magical scenes,” said the\r\nadvertisements, “will break forth about seven, and die away about ten\r\no’clock; during which time Oriental odours and ætherial essences will\r\nperfume the air, while the hymænal sopha blazes forth with the plenitude\r\nof the soft lambent celestial fire.” Having opened such scenes to the\r\neyes of the wondering world, the Doctor thus addresses his\r\ncontemporaries in another advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  TEMPLE OF HEALTH AND HYMEN,\r\n  PALL MALL,\r\n  _Near the King’s Palace._\r\n\r\n  IF there be one human Being, rich or poor, Male or Female, or of the\r\n  doubtful Gender, in or near this great Metropolis of the World, who\r\n  has not had the good Fortune and the Happiness of hearing the\r\n  celebrated Lecture, and of seeing the grand celestial Bed, the\r\n  magnificent electrical Apparatus, and the supremely brilliant and\r\n  unique Decorations of this magical Edifice, of this enchanting Elysian\r\n  Palace!--where Wit and Mirth, Love and Beauty--all that can delight\r\n  the Soul and all that can ravish the Senses--will hold their Court,\r\n  this, and every Evening this week, in chaste and joyous\r\n  Assemblage--let them now come forth, or for ever afterwards let them\r\n  blame themselves and bewail their irremediable Misfortune.\r\n\r\nBut the most important feature of Dr Graham’s establishment was the\r\nCelestial Bed. This wonder-working piece of furniture was made by one\r\nDenton,[39] a tinman, who lived in Coventry Street, and subsequently\r\nkept a bookseller’s shop in High Holborn, and it was said to have cost\r\n£12,000. It was beautifully carved and gilt, covered with silk damask,\r\nsupported by twenty-eight glass pillars, and surmounted by a richly\r\ncarved and gilt canopy, from which crimson silk curtains with fringe and\r\ntassels were suspended. Graham pretended that married couples without\r\nchildren might have heirs by sleeping in this bed, for which privilege\r\nhe demanded one hundred pounds per night; and such is the folly of\r\nwealth, that persons of high rank were named who had acceded to these\r\nterms. This modern Æsculapius sold also for half a guinea a “Treatise on\r\nHealth,” which was intended to render marriages happy, and entered into\r\nfull particulars of the means to ensure this great and important object.\r\nAfter a long list of preliminary and necessary preparations, the\r\nprincipal of which was the utmost attention to cleanliness, the writer\r\ninsisted on certain regulations. He recommended particularly the\r\npractice of early hours for rising and for retiring to rest. He advised\r\nthat in bed-chambers the light, especially that of the moon, should not\r\nbe excluded by curtains. He confessed he could give no sufficient reason\r\nfor this predilection for the lunar rays, but observed that there are a\r\nthousand things in nature which exist without our being able to explain\r\nthe reasons of their existence. He also advised married people to sing\r\nsometimes. “Music,” said he, “softens the mind of a happy couple, makes\r\nthem all love, all harmony; their bodies, their souls unite, their\r\nexistence is melted into a single being, which yields itself up with\r\nrapture to divine transports, and loses itself in an Elysium of bliss.\r\nIn this state, this incessantly progressive enjoyment, the happy couple\r\nimagine themselves raised above this world, and become inhabitants of a\r\nsuperior region.” Thus he continued, till coming at last to the\r\nprincipal part of his discourse: “When the preliminary regimen which I\r\nhave just described has been scrupulously observed and followed, and a\r\nnew vigour has been acquired by drinking of the divine balm, which for\r\nthe benefit of the human race, I have concocted with my own hand, and\r\nwhich, however, costs only a guinea a bottle, and when all these means\r\nhave not proved sufficient for arriving at the end proposed, the last\r\nmust then be absolutely applied to, that most extraordinary expedient\r\nwhich I alone possess, and which cannot fail. This agent is a most\r\nmarvellous celestial bed, which I call magnetico-electric; it is the\r\nfirst, the only one in the world, or that ever existed. It is placed on\r\nthe second floor, in a large and elegant hall, on the right hand of my\r\norchestra, and immediately before my charming hermitage. In a\r\nneighbouring closet is placed a cylinder by which I communicate the\r\ncelestial fire to the bed-chamber, that fluid which animates and\r\nvivifies all, and those cherishing vapours and Oriental perfumes, which\r\nI convey thither by means of tubes of glass. The celestial bed rests on\r\nsix massy and transparent columns; coverings of purple, and curtains of\r\ncelestial blue surround it, and the bed-clothes are perfumed with the\r\nmost costly essences of Arabia: it is exactly similar to those that\r\nadorn the palaces in Persia, and to that of the favourite sultana in the\r\nseraglio of the Grand Turk. This bed is the fruit of the most laborious\r\nindustry, and of the most indefatigable zeal. I will not mention the\r\nsums it has cost me: they are immense. I shall only add that I have\r\nomitted none of those precautions which decency and delicacy have a\r\nright to exact. Neither I, nor any of my people, are entitled to ask who\r\nare the persons that rest in this chamber, which I have denominated the\r\nHoly of Holies. This bed is never shown to those who come only to view\r\nthe accessory parts. This precaution is as proper as it is delicate; for\r\nis there a being frigid enough to resist the influence of that pleasure,\r\nof those transports which this enchanting place inspires? It furnishes\r\nthe grossest imagination with the means of refining its enjoyments, of\r\nmultiplying its pleasures, and of carrying them to their highest degree.\r\nBut the consequences are cruel; such dangerous refinements on the\r\npleasures of the senses abridge the period of life, and relax the\r\nsprings both of body and mind. Persons, however, who would penetrate to\r\nthis throne of pleasure, are intreated to signify their desire to me in\r\nwriting, and having appointed the night, and enclosed a bank-bill for\r\nfifty pounds, I shall furnish them with an admission ticket.”\r\nUltimately, as the demand decreased, the price was reduced to\r\ntwenty-five pounds, and it is said that even less was at times taken.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that Graham’s contemporaries, except the\r\nweakest and most idiotic, believed in the marvellous effects attributed\r\nto this bed, or supposed that the Doctor had any motive in making his\r\nstatements other than those which generally actuate quacks, and lead\r\nthem into exaggerations. He and certain rich voluptuaries worked very\r\nwell together with regard to this couch, as may be gathered from various\r\nsatirical allusions in newspapers of the time, caricatures, &c. It is\r\ncertain that spendthrifts and men of pleasure were the most profitable\r\ncustomers of the great empiric. The more the “Holy of Holies” began to\r\nbe visited, the more did Graham add to the luxury and magnificence of\r\nthe place; but in the month of March 1784 the farce was played out, the\r\nTemple of Health was shut, and all the furniture and apparatus put up\r\nfor public sale. All the paraphernalia which had cost so much money, and\r\nwith which he was identified--the superb temple of Apollo, the immense\r\nelectrical machine, the instruments of music which played incessantly,\r\nand even the famous celestial bed itself--all fell in one common ruin\r\nunder the ruthless hammer of the auctioneer.\r\n\r\nIn a note which serves as a supplement to the description of the\r\nCelestial Bed, the Doctor adds: “Nothing is more surprising than the\r\ntruly divine energy of this celestial and electric fire, which fills\r\nevery part of the bed, as well as the magnetic fluid, both of them\r\ncalculated to give the necessary degree of strength and exertion to the\r\nnerves. Besides the melodious tones of the harmonica, the soft sounds of\r\na flute, the charms of an agreeable voice, and the harmonious notes of\r\nthe organ, being all joined, how can the power and virtue of such a\r\nhappy conjunction fail in raising sentiments of admiration and pleasure\r\nin the soul of the philosopher, and even of the physician?”\r\n\r\nAccording to the advertisements, the descriptive exhibition of the\r\napparatus in the daytime was conducted by an “officiating junior\r\npriest.” This office was filled by a young medical man named Mitford,\r\nafterwards well known as, among other things, father of the celebrated\r\nauthoress. Graham’s expenses were very heavy, and when after a time his\r\nadvertisements failed to draw he fell into poverty, and it is said died\r\nin very straitened circumstances near Glasgow.\r\n\r\n  [39] This Denton was a man of great mechanical skill, who made some\r\n  very curious automaton figures. He was afterwards tried for coining,\r\n  and acquitted on that charge, but was found guilty on a second count\r\n  of having implements of coining in his possession. For this crime he\r\n  was executed at Tyburn, on which occasion Dr Graham was present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n_LOTTERIES AND LOTTERY INSURANCES._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been few things which in their time have had more intimate\r\nconnection with advertising than Lotteries. In fact almost all we can\r\nnow discover about them is by means of the notices which were published\r\nbefore and after a drawing, as the system of picturesque descriptive\r\nwriting now applied to everything had not come into fashion during the\r\nexistence of this legalised species of gambling, which was for\r\ngenerations most ruinous and demoralising in its effects, but which was\r\ncontinued mainly because it added to the revenue, and perhaps because it\r\nwas considered unfair to stop the speculation of the people while gaming\r\nunder so many forms and in so many varieties was indulged in by the\r\nhigher classes. In these days the Legislature has got over any such\r\nsqueamish feelings--even if it ever possessed them--for though gambling\r\nis carried on to as great lengths as ever under certain forms, though\r\nwithin the past few years great scandals have leaked out from clubs and\r\nprivate hells, and though on the turf many noble names have been dragged\r\nthrough the mire, the rank and file of the community are rigidly guarded\r\nfrom any chance of giving way to the temptations of gambling, either by\r\nmeans of the racehorse or the milder forms of speculation which up till\r\nrecently were allowed in public-houses, and are very properly compelled\r\nto be virtuous whether they like it or no.\r\n\r\nThe origin of lotteries is involved in obscurity, but it is generally\r\nbelieved that the first of them was held in Italy early in the\r\nsixteenth century, and that in due course the plan found favour over\r\nhere, and was gradually taken up by the State. From 1569 down to 1826\r\n(except for a short time following upon an Act of the reign of Anne)\r\nlotteries continued to be a source of revenue to the English Government.\r\nSome interesting particulars are given by Hone and Chambers, the latter\r\nof whom says: “It seems strange that so glaringly immoral a project\r\nshould have been kept up with such sanction so long. The younger people\r\nof the present day may be at a loss to believe that, in the days of\r\ntheir fathers, there were large and imposing offices in London, and\r\npretentious agencies in the provinces, for the sale of lottery tickets;\r\nwhile flaming advertisements on walls, in new books, and in public\r\njournals, proclaimed the preferableness of such and such ‘lucky’\r\noffices--this one having sold two-sixteenths of the last\r\ntwenty-thousand-pounds prize; that one a half of the same; another\r\nhaving sold an entire thirty-thousand-pound ticket the year before; and\r\nso on. It was found possible to persuade the public, or a portion of it,\r\nthat where a blessing had once lighted it was the more likely to light\r\nagain. The State lottery was framed on the simple principle, that the\r\nState held forth a certain sum to be repaid by a larger. The transaction\r\nwas usually managed thus. The Government gave £10 in prizes for every\r\nshare taken on an average. A great many blanks or of prizes under £10,\r\nleft, of course, a surplus for the creation of a few magnificent prizes\r\nwherewith to attract the unwary public. Certain firms in the City, known\r\nas lottery-office keepers, contracted for the lottery, each taking a\r\ncertain number of shares; the sum paid by them was always more than £10\r\nper share; and the excess constituted the Government profit. It was\r\ncustomary, for many years, for the contractors to give about £16 to the\r\nGovernment, and then to charge the public from £20 to £22. It was made\r\nlawful for the contractors to divide the shares into halves, quarters,\r\neighths, and sixteenths; and the contractors always charged relatively\r\nmore for these aliquot parts. A man with thirty shillings to spare could\r\nbuy a sixteenth; and the contractors made a large portion of their\r\nprofit out of such customers. The Government sometimes paid the prizes\r\nin terminable annuities instead of cash; and the loan system and the\r\nlottery system were occasionally combined in a very odd way. Thus in\r\n1780, every subscriber of £1000 towards a loan of £12,000,000, at four\r\nper cent., received a bonus of four lottery tickets, the value of each\r\nof which was £10, and any one of which might be the fortunate number for\r\na twenty or thirty thousand pounds prize. Among the lottery offices, the\r\ncompetition for business was intense. One firm, finding an old woman in\r\nthe country named Goodluck, gave her £50 a year on condition that she\r\nwould join them as a nominal partner, for the sake of the attractive\r\neffect of her name. In their advertisements each was sedulous to tell\r\nhow many of the grand prizes had in former years fallen to the lot of\r\npersons who had bought at his shop. Woodcuts and copies of verses were\r\nabundant, suited to attract the uneducated.”\r\n\r\nThe first lottery in this country, so far as is known, took place in\r\n1569. Dr Rawlinson, a distinguished antiquary of the last century,\r\nproduced before the Antiquarian Society in 1748 the following:--\r\n\r\n  A Proposal for a very rich Lottery, general without any Blankes,\r\n  contayning a great N^{o} of good prices, as well of redy money as of\r\n  Plate and certain sorts of Merchandizes, having been valued and prised\r\n  by the Commandment of the Queenes most excellent Majesties order, to\r\n  the extent that such Commodities as may chance to arise thereof, after\r\n  the charges borne, may be converted towards the reparations of the\r\n  Havens and Strength of the realme, and towards such other public good\r\n  workes. The N^{o} of lotts shall be foure hundred thousand, and no\r\n  more; and every lott shall be the summe of tenne shillings sterling\r\n  only, and no more. To be filled by the feast of St Bartholomew. The\r\n  shew of Prises ar to be seen in Cheapside, at the sign of the Queenes\r\n  armes, the house of Mr. Dericke, Goldsmith, Servant to the Queen.\r\n\r\n  Some other Orders about it in 1567-8.\r\n\r\n  Printed by Hen. Bynneman.\r\n\r\nAccording to Stow the drawing of this lottery was commenced at the west\r\ndoor of St Paul’s Cathedral on the 11th of January 1569, and continued\r\nday and night until the 6th of May. It was originally intended to be\r\ndrawn at Dericke’s house, but most likely, as preparations were made, it\r\nwas discovered that a private establishment would be hardly the place\r\nfor so continuous a piece of business. Maitland in his “London” says,\r\n“Whether this lottery was on account of the public, or the selfish views\r\nof private persons, my author[40] does not mention; but it is evident,\r\nby the time it took up in drawing, it must have been of great concern.\r\nThis I have remarked as being the first of the kind I read in England.”\r\nBy these remarks it would seem that neither Stow nor Maitland had seen\r\nthe “Proposal” we have quoted above, which gives the reason for the\r\nlottery.\r\n\r\nIn 1586 there was another drawing, about which we are quaintly told: “A\r\nLotterie, for marvellous rich and beautiful armor, was begunne to be\r\ndrawn at London, in S. Paules churchyard, at the great west gate, (an\r\nhouse of timber and boord being there erected for that purpose) on St.\r\nPeter’s Day in the morning, which Lotterie continued in Drawing day and\r\nnight for the space of two or three daies.”[41] Of this lottery Lord\r\nBurleigh says in his diary at the end of Munden’s State Papers: “June\r\n1586, the Lottery of Armour under the charge of John Calthorp\r\ndetermined.” About the year 1612 James I., “in special favour for the\r\nplantation of English colonies in Virginia, granted a lottery to be held\r\nat the west end of St Paul’s; whereof one Thomas Sharplys, a taylor of\r\nLondon, had the chief prize, which was four thousand crowns in fair\r\nplate.”[42]\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _Gentlemen’s Magazine_ in 1778 gives Mr Urban\r\nsome particulars regarding a lottery “held in London for the present\r\nplantation of English colonies in Virginia” in 1619. The writer says:\r\n“It may be found, perhaps, upon strict enquiry that this mode of\r\nraising money was authorized in many wealthy towns, as well as in the\r\ncapital; and that it was attended with beneficial effects, not only to\r\nthe colony of Virginia, but likewise to the town itself where the\r\nlottery was held. In proof of this supposition I send you the following\r\nauthentic extract from the Register of charitable Gifts to the\r\nCorporation of Reading:”--\r\n\r\n  Whereas at a Lottery held within the Borough of Reading in the Year of\r\n  our Ld. God 1619, Gabriel Barber Gent. Agent in the sd. Lottery for\r\n  the Councell & Company of Virginia, of his own good Will & Charity\r\n  towarde poor Tradesmen ffreemen & Inhabitants of the sd. Borough of\r\n  Reading, & for the better enabling such poor Tradesmen to support &\r\n  bear their Charges in their several Places & Callings in the sd.\r\n  Corporation from time to time for ever freely gave & delivered to the\r\n  Mayor & Burgesses of this Corporation the sum of forty Pounds of\r\n  lawfull Money of England Upon Special Trust & Confidence, that the sd.\r\n  Mayor & Burgesses & their Successors shall from time to time for ever\r\n  dispose & lend these 40l. to & amongst Six poor Tradesmen after the\r\n  rate 06l. 13s. 4d. to each Man for the Term of five Years gratis And\r\n  after those five Years ended to dispose & lend the sd. 40l. by Such\r\n  Soms to Six other poor Tradesmen for other five Years & so from five\r\n  years to five years Successively upon good Security for ever\r\n  Neverthelesse provided & upon Condition that none of those to whom the\r\n  sd. Summs of money shall be lent during that Term of five years shall\r\n  keep either Inn or Tavern or dwell forth of the sd. Borough, but there\r\n  during that time and terme, shall as other Inhabitants of the sd.\r\n  Borough reside & dwell.\r\n\r\n  Memorand. that the sd. Sum of 40l. came not into the hands & charge of\r\n  the Mayor & Burgesses until April 1626.\r\n\r\nThe writer then concludes with the following somewhat puzzling sentence:\r\n“If it be asked what is become of it now? _gone_, it is supposed, _where\r\nthe chickens went before_ during the pious Protectorship of Cromwell.”\r\n\r\nHone in his “Everyday-Book” says that “in 1630, 6th Charles I., there\r\nwas a project ‘for the conveying of certain springs of water into London\r\nand Westminster, from within a mile and a half of Hodsdon, in\r\nHertfordshire, by the undertakers, Sir Edward Stradling and John Lyde.’\r\nThe author of this project was one Michael Parker. ‘For defraying the\r\nexpenses whereof, King Charles grants them a special licence to erect\r\nand publish a lottery or lotteries; _according_,’ says this record, ‘_to\r\nthe course of other lotteries_ heretofore used or practised.’ This is\r\nthe first mention of lotteries either in the _Fœdera_ or Statute-book.\r\n‘And for the sole privilege of bringing the said waters in aqueducts to\r\nLondon, they were to pay four thousand pounds per annum into the king’s\r\nexchequer: and, the better to enable them to make the said large annual\r\npayment, the king grants them leave to bring their aqueducts through any\r\nof his parks, chases, lands, &c., and to dig up the same gratis.’” In\r\n1653 there was a lottery at Grocers’ Hall, which has escaped the\r\nobservation of the earliest inquirers on this subject. In an old weekly\r\npaper, called _Perfect Account of the Daily Intelligence_, November\r\n16-23, 1653, there is the following:--\r\n\r\n  ^Advertisement.^\r\n\r\n  _At the Committee for Claims for Lands in Ireland,_\r\n\r\n  Ordered, that a Lottery be at Grocers-Hall, London, on Thursday 15\r\n  Decem. 1653, both for Provinces and Counties, to begin at 8 of the\r\n  Clock in the forenoon of the same day; and all persons concerned\r\n  therein are to take notice thereof.\r\n\r\n  _W. Tibbs._\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration, Charles, whose ideas of rewarding fidelity were\r\nalways peculiar, granted plate lotteries “with a view to reward those\r\nadherents of the Crown who resided within the bills of mortality, and\r\nhad served with fidelity during the interregnum.” By this is to be\r\nunderstood a gift of plate from the Crown to be disposed of by lot,\r\ncertain persons--most likely those who had no claim whatever on the\r\nscore of fidelity--having the privilege of selling tickets. The\r\n_Gazette_ tells us that in 1669 Charles II., the Duke of York, and many\r\nof the nobility were present “at the grand plate lottery, which, by his\r\nMajesty’s command, was then opened at the sign of the Mermaid, over\r\nagainst the mews.” Even if this had been a proper way to reward the\r\nfaithful, the faithfullest must have felt it had been left rather late.\r\nFrom this plate lottery sprang many successors, the most noticeable of\r\nwhich was the Royal Oak, whose title explains itself. The rapid growth\r\nof the institution may be judged by the following, which, according to\r\nAnderson in his “History of Commerce,” was published shortly after the\r\ndrawing to which we have referred:--\r\n\r\n  THIS is to give Notice, that any Persons who are desirous to farm any\r\n  of the Counties within the Kingdom of England, or Dominion of Wales,\r\n  in Order to the setting up of a Plate Lottery, or any other Lottery\r\n  whatsoever, may repair to the Lottery Office, at Mr. Philips’s House,\r\n  in Mermaid Court over against the Mews; where they may contract with\r\n  the Trustees commissioned by his Majesties Letters Patent for the\r\n  Management of the said Patent, on the Behalf of the truly Loyal\r\n  Indigent Officers.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that “the Crown exceeded its prerogative by issuing these\r\npatents, and the law was not put in motion to question them.” This was\r\nnot the only point upon which the royal rights were extended, but the\r\ntide of loyalty had set in strongly, and Charles was not likely to miss\r\nany of the current’s strength. Book lotteries were before this time much\r\nin fashion, and with the kinds which came in afterwards, were drawn at\r\nthe theatres. At Vere Street theatre, which stood in Bear Yard, to which\r\nthere was an entrance through a passage at the south-west corner of\r\nLincoln’s Inn Fields, another from Vere Street, and a third from Clare\r\nMarket, Killigrew’s company performed during the seasons of 1661 and\r\n1662, and part of 1663, when they removed to the newly-built theatre in\r\nDrury Lane; the Vere Street theatre was then probably unoccupied until\r\nMr Ogilby, the author of the “Itinerarum Angliæ, or Book of Roads,”\r\nadopted it, as standing in a populous neighbourhood, for the temporary\r\npurpose of drawing a lottery of books, which took place in 1668. Books\r\nwere often the species of property held out as a lure to adventurers, by\r\nway of lottery, for the benefit of the suffering Loyalists. In the\r\n_Gazette_ of May 18, 1668, is the following advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  MR. Ogilby’s Lottery of Books opens on Monday the 25th instant, at the\r\n  old Theatre between Lincoln’s Inn Fields and Vere street, where all\r\n  Persons concerned may repair on Monday May 18, and see the Volumes,\r\n  and put in their Money.\r\n\r\nBut the business being much better than was anticipated, the drawing had\r\nto be postponed, and so in the number of the _Gazette_ for May 25 there\r\nis this:--\r\n\r\n  MR. Ogilby’s Lottery of Books (Adventurers coming in so fast that they\r\n  cannot in so short Time be methodically registered) opens not till\r\n  Tuesday the 2d of June; then not failing to draw; at the old Theatre\r\n  between Lincoln’s Inn Fields and Vere street.\r\n\r\nOgilby had had a venture before this, about which there seems to have\r\nbeen some little difficulty, as in his “Proposal” for this same lottery\r\nhe refers to aspersions which have been made. A correspondent of the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_ of nearly a hundred years ago gives as a\r\ncuriosity even then a copy of this “Proposal,” which, though rather\r\nlong, is very interesting, and so we subjoin it:--\r\n\r\n  A SECOND PROPOSAL, by the Author, for the better and more speedy\r\n  Vendition of several Volumes, (his own Works,) by the way of a\r\n  standing _Lottery_, licensed by his Royal Highness the Duke of York,\r\n  and Assistants at the Corporation of the royal Fishing.\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS _John Ogilby_, esq., erected a standing Lottery of Books, and\r\n  completely furnished the same with very large, fair, and special\r\n  Volumes, all of his own Designment and Composure, at vast Expense,\r\n  Labour and Study of twenty Years; the like Impressions never before\r\n  exhibited in the English Tongue. Which according to the appointed\r\n  Time, on the 10th of May, 1665, opened; and to the general\r\n  Satisfaction of the Adventurers, with no less Hopes of a clear\r\n  Despatch and fair Advantage to the Author, was several Days in\r\n  Drawing: when its Proceedings were stopt by the then growing Sickness\r\n  and lay discontinued under the Arrest of that common Calamity, till\r\n  the next Year’s more violent and sudden Visitation, the late dreadful\r\n  and surprising Conflagration, swallowed the Remainder, being two Parts\r\n  of three, to the Value of three thousand Pounds and upward, in that\r\n  unimaginable Deluge. Therefore, to repair in some Manner his so much\r\n  commiserated Losses, by the Advice of so many his Patrons, Friends,\r\n  and especially by the Incitations of his former Adventurers, he\r\n  resolves, and hath already prepared, not only to reprint all his own\r\n  former Editions, but others that are new, of equal Value, and like\r\n  Estimation by their Embellishments, and never yet Published; with some\r\n  remains of the first Impressions, Relics preserved in several Hands\r\n  from the Fire; to set up a second standing Lottery, where such the\r\n  Discrimination of Fortune shall be, that few or None shall return with\r\n  a dissatisfying Chance. The whole Draught being of greater Advantage\r\n  by much (to the Adventurers) than the former. And accordingly, after\r\n  Publication, the Author opened his Office, where they might put in\r\n  their first Encouragements (_viz._) twenty Shillings, and twenty more\r\n  at the reception of their Fortune, and also see those several\r\n  magnificent Volumes, which their varied Fortune (none being bad)\r\n  should present them.\r\n\r\n  [43]But the Author now finding more difficulty than he expected, since\r\n  many of his Promisers (who also received great Store of Tickets to\r\n  dispose of, towards promotion of his Business) though seeming well\r\n  resolved and very willing, yet straining Courtesy not to go foremost\r\n  in paying their monies, linger out, driving it off till near the time\r\n  appointed for Drawing; which Dilatoriness: (since Despatch is the soul\r\n  and life to his Proposal, his only Advantage a speedy Vendition:) and\r\n  also observing how that a Money Dearth, a Silver Famine, slackens and\r\n  cools the Courage of Adventurers: through which hazy humours\r\n  magnifying medium Shillings loome like Crowns, and each forty\r\n  Shillings a ten Pound Heap. Therefore, according to the present Humour\r\n  now reigning, he intends to adequate his Design; and this seeming too\r\n  large-roomed, standing Lottery, modelled into many less and more\r\n  likely to be taken Tenements, which shall not open only a larger\r\n  Prospect of pleasing Hopes, but more real Advantage to the Adventurer.\r\n  Which are now to be disposed of thus: the whole Mass of Books or\r\n  Volumes, being the same without Addition or Diminution, amounting\r\n  according to their known Value (being the Prices they have been\r\n  usually disposed at) to thirteen thousand seven hundred Pounds; so\r\n  that the Adventurers will have the above said Volumes (if all are\r\n  drawn) for less than two-thirds of what they would yield in Process\r\n  of Time, Book by Book. He now resolves to attempter, or mingle each\r\n  Prize with four allaying Blanks; so bringing down, by this Means, the\r\n  Market from double Pounds to single Crowns.\r\n\r\n  THE PROPOSITIONS.--First, whosoever will be pleased to put in five\r\n  Shillings shall draw a Lot, his Fortune to receive the greatest or\r\n  meanest Prize, or throw away his intended spending Money on a Blank.\r\n  Secondly, whoever will adventure deeper, putting in twenty-five\r\n  Shillings, shall receive, if such his bad Fortune be that he draws all\r\n  Blanks, a Prize presented to him by the Author of more value than his\r\n  Money (if offered to be sold) though proffered ware, &c. Thirdly, who\r\n  thinks fit to put in for eight Lots forty Shillings shall receive\r\n  nine, and the advantage of their free Choice (of all Blanks) of either\r\n  of the Works complete, _viz._ Homer’s Iliads and Odysses, or Æsop the\r\n  first and second Volumes, the China Book, or Virgil.

The Adventurers may\r\n  also repair for their better Convenience, to pay in their Monies, to\r\n  Mr. Peter Cleyton, over against the Dutch Church, in Austin Friars,\r\n  and to Mr. Baker, near Broad Street, entering the South door of the\r\n  Exchange, and to Mr. Roycroft, in Bartholomew Close.\r\n\r\n  The certain Day of Drawing, the Author promiseth (though but half\r\n  full) to be the twenty-third of May next. Therefore all Persons that\r\n  are willing to Adventure, are desired to bring or send in their Monies\r\n  with their Names, or what other Inscription or Motto they will, by\r\n  which to know their own, by the ninth of May next, it being Whitson\r\n  Eve, that the Author may have Time to put up the Lots and Inscriptions\r\n  into their respective Boxes.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the positive promise given as to the date of the\r\ndrawing, there seems, judging by the advertisements first quoted, to\r\nhave been two alterations in the time. Mr Ogilby assorted his wares in\r\nthe most tempting manner, and it is interesting to know what were\r\nconsidered the most marketable books, with their relative values, over\r\ntwo hundred years ago. Even then, and long before either became\r\nfamiliar to the bulk of English readers, the Iliad was worth a pound\r\nmore than the Odyssey. Æsop was rated, entire, at more than the best of\r\nthe Homeric books, but divided, he was inferior to either, and Virgil\r\ncomplete was worth exactly the same amount as the Iliad. A contributor\r\nto the _Gentleman’s Magazine_, about a hundred years back, states that\r\nhe had seen a then very old but undated “Address to the Learned, or an\r\nadvantageous lottery for books in quires; wherein each adventurer of a\r\nguinea is sure of a prize of two pounds value; and it is but four to one\r\nthat he has a prize of three, six, eight, twelve, or fifty pounds.” The\r\nproposals for this lottery were, one thousand four hundred lots, at a\r\nguinea each, to be drawn with the lots out of two glasses, superintended\r\nby John Lilly and Edward Darrel, Esqs., Mr Deputy Collins, and Mr\r\nWilliam Proctor, stationer; two lots of £50, ten of £12, twenty of £8,\r\nsixty-eight of £6, two hundred of £5, and one thousand two hundred of\r\n£3. Letters-patent on behalf of the promoters of Lotteries were from\r\ntime to time renewed, and from the _Gazette_ of October 11, 1675, it\r\nappears by those dated June 19 and December 17, 1674, there were granted\r\nfor thirteen years to come, “all lotteries whatsoever invented or to be\r\ninvented, to several truly loyal and indigent officers, in consideration\r\nof their many faithful services and sufferings, with prohibition to all\r\nothers to use or set up the said lotteries.” These officers were also\r\ngranted powers to give licences and name agents.\r\n\r\nIn the _Examiner_, about the time when Lotteries were suppressed, there\r\nis much information concerning them, and the writer among other things\r\nfinds, from a copy of the _London Gazette_ of May 17, 1688, that\r\n“Ogilby, the better to carry on his ‘Britannia,’ had a lottery of books\r\nat Garraway’s Coffeehouse in ’Change Alley.” Lotteries of various kinds\r\nseem to have been very general before this date; indeed so much so that\r\nGovernment issued a notice in the _London Gazette_, September 27, 1683,\r\nto prevent the drawing of any lotteries (and especially a\r\nnewly-invented lottery under the name of the riffling, or raffling,\r\nlottery) “except those under his Majesty’s letters-patent, for thirteen\r\nyears, granted to persons for their sufferings, and have their seal of\r\noffice with this inscription, ‘_Meliora Designavi_.’” In 1683, Prince\r\nRupert dying rather poor, a plan was devised to obtain money by\r\ndisposing of all his jewels; but as the public were not satisfied with\r\nthe mode of drawing the lotteries, on account of the many cheats\r\npractised on them, they would not listen to any proposals until the King\r\nhimself guaranteed to see that all was fair, and also that Mr Francis\r\nChild, the goldsmith at Temple Bar, would be answerable for their\r\nseveral adventures, as appears by the _London Gazette_, October 1,\r\n1683:--\r\n\r\n  THESE are to give notice, that the Jewels of his late Royal Highness\r\n  Prince Rupert have been particularly valued and appraised by Mr. Isaac\r\n  Legouch, Mr Christopher Rosse, and Mr. Richard Beauvoir, Jewellers,\r\n  the whole amounting to Twenty Thousand Pounds, and will be sold by way\r\n  of Lottery, each Lot to be Five Pounds. The biggest Prize will be a\r\n  great Pearl Necklace, valued at 8,000_l._, and none less than 100_l._\r\n  A printed Particular of the said Appraisement, with their Divisions\r\n  into Lots, will be delivered gratis by Mr. Francis Child, at Temple\r\n  Bar, London, into whose Hands, such as are willing to be Adventurers\r\n  are desired to pay their Money, on or before the 1st Day of November\r\n  next. As soon as the whole Sum is paid in, a short Day will be\r\n  appointed which, (it is hoped, will be before Christmas) and notified\r\n  in the _Gazette_, for the Drawing thereof, which will be done in his\r\n  Majesty’s Presence, who is pleased to declare, that _he himself will\r\n  see all the Prizes put in among the Blanks_, and that the whole will\r\n  be managed with Equity and Fairness, Nothing being intended but the\r\n  sale of the said Jewels at a moderate Value. And it is further\r\n  notified, for the Satisfaction of all as shall be Adventurers, that\r\n  the said Mr. _Child_ shall and will stand obliged to Each of them for\r\n  their several Adventures. And that each Adventurer shall receive their\r\n  Money back if the said Lottery be not drawn and finished before the\r\n  first Day of February next.\r\n\r\nThis Mr Child is said to have been the first regular banker. He began\r\nbusiness soon after the Restoration, and received the honour of\r\nknighthood. He lived in Fleet Street, where the shop still continues in\r\na state of the highest respectability.[44] A subsequent notice says that\r\n\r\n  The King will probably, to-morrow, in the Banquetting House, see all\r\n  the Blanks told over, that they may not exceed their Number; and that\r\n  the Papers on which the Prizes are to be written shall be rolled up in\r\n  his Presence; and that a Child, appointed, either by his Majesty or\r\n  the Adventurers, shall draw the Prizes.\r\n\r\nThe most popular of all the schemes of the time was that drawn at the\r\nDorset Garden Theatre, near Salisbury Square, Fleet Street, with the\r\ncapital prize of a thousand pounds for a penny. The drawing began on\r\nOctober 19, 1698; and in the _Protestant Mercury_ of the following day\r\nits fairness was said to give universal content to all that were\r\nconcerned. In the next number is found an inconsistent story as to the\r\npossessor of the prize. It runs thus: “Sometime since, a boy near\r\nBranford going to school one morning, met an old woman, who asked his\r\ncharity; the boy replied, he had nothing to give her but a piece of\r\nbread and butter, which she accepted. Sometime after, she met the boy\r\nagain, and told him she had good luck after his bread and butter, and\r\ntherefore would give him a penny which, after some years keeping, would\r\nproduce many pounds: he accordingly kept it a great while, and at last,\r\nwith some friends’ advice, put it into the Penny Lottery, and we are\r\ninformed that on Tuesday last, the said lot came up with £1000 prize.”\r\nThis is a very fair specimen of the stories which were always afloat\r\nconcerning the chief prizes in the principal lotteries, and which had\r\nalways some superstitious current underlying them, much to the benefit\r\nof the vendors of tickets. The scheme of the Penny Lottery was assailed\r\nin a tract entitled “The Wheel of Fortune, or Nothing for a Penny; being\r\nRemarks on the Drawing of the Penny Lottery at the Theatre Royal, in\r\nDorset Garden.” (1698, 4to.) Afterwards this theatre was used for\r\nexhibitions of sword-and-cudgel players, prize-fighters, &c.; but the\r\nbuilding was totally deserted in 1703. In the last years of the century,\r\nschemes were started called “The Lucky Adventure; or, Fortunate Chance,\r\nbeing 2000_l._ for a groat, or 3000_l._ for a shilling;” and\r\n“Fortunatus, or another Adventure of 1000_l._ for a Penny;” but\r\npurchasers were more wary, and the promoters’ plans in both cases fell\r\nto the ground. The royal patentees also advertised against the “Marble\r\nBoard, alias Woollich Board lotteries; the Figure Board, alias the\r\nWhimsey Board and the Wyre Board lotteries.” The patentees were, in\r\naddition, always quarrelling among themselves; and the following lines\r\nfrom the _Post-Boy_, January 3, 1698, were very popular at the time, as\r\ngiving an estimate of the disputes between the legalised rogues:--\r\n\r\n  A DIALOGUE _betwixt the_ NEW LOTTERIES _and the_ ROYAL OAK.\r\n\r\n      _New Lott._ To you the Mother of our Schools,\r\n    Where knaves by license manage Fools,\r\n    Finding fit Juncture and Occasion,\r\n    To pick the Pockets of the Nation;\r\n    We come to know how we must treat ’em,\r\n    And to their hearts’ content may cheat ’em.\r\n\r\n      _Oak._ It cheers my aged Heart to see\r\n    So numerous a Progeny;\r\n    I find by you, that ’tis Heaven’s will\r\n    That knavery should flourish still;\r\n    You have docility and wit,\r\n    And Fools were never wanting yet.\r\n      Observe the crafty Auctioneer\r\n    His art to sell waste Paper dear;\r\n    When he for Salmon baits his Hooks,\r\n    That Cormorant of Offal books,\r\n    Who bites, as sure as Maggots breed,\r\n    Or Carrion Crows on Horseflesh feed;\r\n    Fair specious Titles him deceive,\r\n    To sweep what Sl---- and T----n leave.\r\n      If greedy gulls you would ensnare,\r\n    Make ’em Proposals wondrous fair;\r\n    Tell him strange Golden Show’rs shall fall,\r\n    And promise Mountains to ’em all.\r\n\r\n      _New Lott._ That Craft we’ve already taught,\r\n    And by that Trick have millions caught;\r\n    Books, Baubles, Toys, all sorts of Stuff,\r\n    Have gone off this way well enough.\r\n    Nay, Music, too, invades our Art,\r\n    And to some Tune wou’d play her Part.\r\n    I’ll show you now what we are doing,\r\n    For we have divers Wheels agoing.\r\n    We now have found out richer Lands,\r\n    Than Asia’s Hills, or Afric’s Sands,\r\n    And to vast Treasures must give Birth,\r\n    Deep hid in Bowels of the Earth;\r\n    In fertile Wales, and God knows where,\r\n    Rich mines of Gold and Silver are,\r\n    From whence we draw prodigious Store\r\n    Of Silver coin’d, tho’ none in Ore,\r\n    Which down our Throats rich Coxcombs pour,\r\n    In hopes to make us vomit more.\r\n\r\n      _Oak._ This Project surely must be good\r\n    Because not eas’ly understood;\r\n    Besides, it gives a mighty Scope\r\n    To the Fool’s Argument--vain Hope.\r\n    No Eagle’s Eye the Cheat can see,\r\n    Thro’ Hope thus back’d by Mystery.\r\n\r\n      _New Lott._ We have, besides, a thousand more,\r\n    For Great or Small, for Rich and Poor,\r\n    From him that can his Thousands spare,\r\n    Down to the Penny Customer.\r\n\r\n      _Oak._ The silly Mob in Crowds will run,\r\n    To be at easy Rates undone.\r\n    A gimcrack Show draws in the Rout,\r\n    Thousands their all by Pence lay out.\r\n\r\n      _New Lott._ We, by Experience, find it true,\r\n    But we have Methods wholly new,\r\n    Strange late-invented Ways to thrive,\r\n    To make Men pay for what they give,\r\n    To get the Rents into our Hands\r\n    Of their hereditary Lands,\r\n    And out of what does thence arise,\r\n    To make ’em buy Annuities.\r\n    We’ve mathematick Combination,\r\n    To cheat Folks by plain Demonstration,\r\n    Which shall be fairly manag’d too,\r\n    The Undertaker knows not how.\r\n    Besides----\r\n\r\n      _Oak._ Pray, hold a little, here’s enough,\r\n    To beggar Europe of this Stuff.\r\n    Go on, and prosper, and be great,\r\n    I am to you a puny Cheat.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Oak Lottery came in for a great share of public odium, it\r\nbeing regarded as the parent of all the others. A very curious tract of\r\n1699 sets forth the various charges against it in the form of a trial.\r\nThe pamphlet is called “The Arraignment, Trial and Condemnation of\r\n_Squire Lottery_, alias _Royal-Oak Lottery_.” The various charges,\r\ndefences, and counter-charges are very funny, and we regret that we have\r\nonly room here for the jury list, which shows that the “British\r\npalladium” possessed then many of its present features, judged by the\r\ncharacters and pretensions of the jurymen. The descriptions of these\r\nlatter would fit pretty well even in these days:--\r\n\r\n  _The Jurors’ Names._\r\n\r\n  Mr. _Positive_, a Draper in _Covent Garden_.\r\n  Mr. _Squander_, an Oilman in _Fleet Street_.\r\n  Mr. _Pert_, a Tobacconist, _ditto_.\r\n  Mr. _Captious_, a Milliner in _Paternoster Row_.\r\n  Mr. _Feeble_, a Coffeeman near the _Change_.\r\n  Mr. _Altrick_, a Merchant in _Gracechurch Street_.\r\n  Mr. _Haughty_, a Vintner by _Grays-Inn, Holborn_.\r\n  Mr. _Jealous_, a Cutler at _Charing Cross_.\r\n  Mr. _Peevish_, a Bookseller in _St. Paul’s Churchyard_.\r\n  Mr. _Spilbook_, near _Fleet Bridge_.\r\n  Mr. _Noysie_, a Silkman upon _Ludgate Hill_.\r\n  Mr. _Finical_, a Barber in _Cheapside_.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that during the whole of the trial no individual\r\ninterferes with either the Court or the witnesses, there being no\r\nmention in the report of “a Juror;” and as might have been anticipated,\r\nthe trial ends with the wholesale condemnation of Squire Lottery, and\r\nan order for his immediate execution. Private and fallacious lotteries\r\nhad by this time become so common, not only in London, but in most other\r\ngreat cities and towns of England, whereby the lower people and the\r\nservants and children of good families were defrauded, that an Act of\r\nParliament was therefore passed, 10 and 11 William III. c. 17, for\r\nsuppressing such lotteries, “even although they might be set up under\r\ncolour of patents or grants under the Great Seal. Which said grants, or\r\npatents,” says the preamble, “are against the common good, welfare, and\r\npeace of the kingdom, and are void and against law.” A penalty,\r\ntherefore, of five hundred pounds was laid on the proprietors of any\r\nsuch lotteries, and of twenty pounds on every adventurer in them.\r\nNotwithstanding this, the like disposition to fraud and gaming prevailed\r\nagain till fresh laws were enacted for their suppression. The public,\r\nor, as they were called, the Parliamentary, lotteries, went on, however,\r\nas merrily as before, though they were every now and again\r\nthreatened--indeed for nearly a hundred and thirty years lotteries were\r\nalways on the point of being abolished. The promoters of lotteries, even\r\nin the early days, thoroughly knew the value of advertising by means of\r\npuffs, and many of their paragraphs are found given as ordinary news,\r\nfor the more effectual trapping of the gulls. Such a one is this from\r\nthe _Post-Boy_ of December 27, 1710:--\r\n\r\n  We are informed that the Parliamentary Lottery will be fixed in this\r\n  Manner:--150,000 Tickets will be delivered out at 10_l._ each Ticket,\r\n  making in all the Sum of 1,500,000_l._ Sterling; the Principal thereof\r\n  is to be sunk, the Parliament allowing nine per cent. Interest for the\r\n  whole during the Term of thirty-two Years, which Interest is to be\r\n  divided as follows: 3750 Tickets will be Prizes from 1000_l._ to 5_l._\r\n  per annum, during the said thirty-two Years; all the other Tickets\r\n  will be Blanks, so that there will be thirty-nine of these to one\r\n  Prize, but then each Blank Ticket will be entitled to fourteen\r\n  Shillings a year for the Term of thirty-two Years, which is better\r\n  than an Annuity for life at ten per cent. over and above chance of\r\n  getting a prize.\r\n\r\nSuch was the eagerness of the public to secure shares in this great and\r\nliberal undertaking on the part of a beneficent Legislature, that\r\nMercers’ Hall was literally crowded, and the clerks were found\r\nincompetent to receive the influx of names. Six hundred thousand pounds\r\nwas subscribed by January 21; and on the 28th of February the required\r\namount of a million and a half had been taken out in shares. This rage\r\nfor speculation had much to do with the success of the South-Sea Bubble,\r\nwhich was attended by myriad smaller bubbles that in the grand collapse\r\nof the most magnificent swindle of modern times have been quite\r\nforgotten. But many large fortunes were made by small means. In the\r\nheight of the speculative fever, hardly a day, certainly not a week,\r\npassed without fresh projects, recommended by pompous paragraphs in the\r\nnewspapers, directing where to subscribe to them. On some six per cent.\r\nwas paid down, on others one shilling per thousand at the time of\r\nsubscribing. Some of the obscure keepers of these books of subscription,\r\ncontenting themselves with what they had netted in the morning, by\r\nthe registration of one or two millions, disappeared in the afternoon,\r\nthe rooms they had hired being shut up, and they and their\r\nsubscription-books being never heard of more. On others of these\r\nprojects, two shillings, and two-and-sixpence, were paid down; for some\r\nfew even half a sovereign per cent. was deposited, but this was only in\r\nthe case of those who could find some person of standing to recommend\r\nthem in Exchange Alley. Some were divided into shares instead of\r\nhundreds and thousands, upon each of which so much was paid down. Any\r\nimpudent impostor, while the delusion was at its greatest height, needed\r\nonly to hire a room near the alley for a few hours, and open a\r\nsubscription-book for a pretended scheme relating to commerce,\r\nmanufacture, plantation, or some supposed invention, having first\r\nadvertised it in the newspapers of the preceding day, and he might in a\r\nfew hours find subscribers for one or two millions of imaginary stock.\r\nYet many of the subscribers were far from believing the project\r\nfeasible; it was enough for their purpose that there would soon be a\r\npremium on the receipts for the subscriptions, when they could easily\r\nget rid of them in the crowded alley to others more credulous than\r\nthemselves. Indeed some of these bubbles were so barefaced and palpably\r\ngross as not to have the shadow of anything like feasibility: such, for\r\ninstance, were an insurance against divorces; a scheme to learn men to\r\ncast nativities; another for making butter from beech-trees; a project\r\nfor a flying machine; a company for fattening hogs; and a proposal for a\r\nmore inoffensive method of emptying or cleansing necessary-houses.\r\n\r\nAddison, of course, availed himself of the opportunity afforded by the\r\ngreat lottery mania, and in the _Spectator_ for Tuesday, October 9,\r\n1711, he comments on the peculiarities of investors. “When a man has a\r\nmind to venture his money in a lottery,” says he, “every figure of it\r\nappears equally alluring, and as likely to succeed as any of its\r\nfellows. They all of them have the same pretensions to good luck, stand\r\nupon the same foot of competition, and no manner of reason can be given\r\nwhy a man should prefer one to the other before the lottery is drawn. In\r\nthis case, therefore, caprice very often acts in the place of reason,\r\nand forms to itself some groundless imaginary motive, where real and\r\nsubstantial ones are wanting. I know a well-meaning man that is very\r\nwell pleased to risk his good fortune upon the number 1711, because it\r\nis the year of our Lord. I am acquainted with a tacker that would give a\r\ngood deal for the number 134. On the contrary, I have been told of a\r\ncertain zealous dissenter, who being a great enemy to Popery, and\r\nbelieving that bad men are the most fortunate in this world, will lay\r\ntwo to one on the number 666 against any other number, because, says he,\r\nit is the number of the Beast. Several would prefer the number 12,000\r\nbefore any other, as it is the number of the pounds in the great prize.\r\nIn short, some are pleased to find their own age in their number; some\r\nthat have got a number which makes a pretty appearance in the ciphers;\r\nand others because it is the same number that succeeded in the last\r\nlottery. Each of these, upon no other grounds, thinks he stands fairest\r\nfor the great lot, and that he is possessed of what may not be\r\nimprobably called--‘the golden number.’”\r\n\r\nThe reference to the number 134 is made on account of a bill which was\r\nbrought into the House of Commons against occasional Conformity; and so\r\nthat it should pass through the Lords, it was proposed to tack it to a\r\nmoney bill. This proposal caused some warm debates, and at last, on\r\nbeing put to the vote, it was found that 134 were for tacking. A large\r\nmajority was, however, against it, and the motion fell through. The\r\nBeast’s number is, of course, a reference to Revelation xiii. 18; and\r\nthe final allusion in the paragraph we will not insult the reader by\r\nattempting to explain. Addison then goes on: “These principles of\r\nelection are the pastimes and extravagances of human reason, which is of\r\nso busy a nature, that it will be exerting itself in the meanest\r\ntrifles, and working even where it wants materials. The wisest of men\r\nare sometimes acted by such unaccountable motives, as the life of the\r\nfool and the superstitious is guided by nothing else. I am surprised\r\nthat none of the fortune-tellers, or, as the French call them, the\r\n_Diseurs de bonne Aventure_, who publish their bills in every quarter of\r\nthe town, have turned our lotteries to their advantage. Did any of them\r\nset up for a caster of fortunate figures, what might he not get by his\r\npretended discoveries and predictions? I remember, among the\r\nadvertisements in the _Post-Boy_ of September the 27th, I was surprised\r\nto see the following one:--\r\n\r\n  _This is to give Notice that ten Shillings over and above the Market\r\n  Price, will be given for the Ticket in the 1,500,000l. Lottery, No.\r\n  132_, by Nath. Cliff, _at the_ Bible and Three Crowns _in Cheapside_.\r\n\r\n“This advertisement has given great matter of speculation to\r\ncoffee-house theorists. Mr. Cliff’s principles and conversation have\r\nbeen canvassed upon this occasion, and various conjectures made why he\r\nshould thus set his heart upon No. 132. I have examined all the powers\r\nin those numbers, broken them into fractions, extracted the square and\r\ncube root, divided and multiplied them all ways, but could not arrive at\r\nthe secret until about three days ago, when I received the following\r\nletter from an unknown hand, by which I find that Mr. Nath. Cliff is\r\nonly the agent, and not the principal, in this advertisement. ‘Mr.\r\nSpectator,--I am the person that lately advertised I would give ten\r\nshillings more than the current price for the ticket No. 132, in the\r\nlottery now drawing, which is a secret I have communicated to some\r\nfriends, who rally me incessantly upon that account. You must know I\r\nhave but one ticket, for which reason, and a certain dream I have lately\r\nhad more than once, I resolved it should be the number I most approved.\r\nI am so positive that I have pitched upon the great lot, that I could\r\nalmost lay all I am worth upon it. My visions are so frequent and strong\r\nupon this occasion, that I have not only possessed the lot, but disposed\r\nof the money which in all probability it will sell for. This morning in\r\nparticular I set up an equipage which I look upon to be the gayest in\r\nthe town; the liveries are very rich, but not gaudy. I should be very\r\nglad to see a speculation or two upon lottery subjects, in which you\r\nwould oblige all people concerned, and in particular, your most humble\r\nservant George Gosling. P.S. Dear Spec, if I get the 12,000_l._ I’ll\r\nmake thee a handsome present.’ After having wished my correspondent good\r\nluck, and thanked him for his intended kindness, I shall for this time\r\ndismiss the subject of the lottery, and only observe, that the greatest\r\npart of mankind are in some degree guilty of my friend Gosling’s\r\nextravagance. We are apt to rely upon future prospects, and become\r\nreally expensive while we are only rich in possibility. We live up to\r\nour expectations, not to our possessions, and make a figure\r\nproportionable to what we may be, not what we are. We outrun our present\r\nincome, as not doubting to disburse ourselves out of the profits of some\r\nfuture place, project, or reversion that we have in view. It is through\r\nthis temper of mind, which is so common among us, that we see tradesmen\r\nbreak, who have met with no misfortunes in their business; and men of\r\nestate reduced to poverty, who have never suffered from losses or\r\nrepairs, tenants, taxes, or lawsuits. In short, it is this foolish\r\nsanguine temper, this depending upon contingent futurities, that\r\noccasions romantic generosity, chimerical grandeur, senseless\r\nostentation, and generally ends in beggary and ruin. The man who will\r\nlive above his present circumstances, is in great danger of living in a\r\nlittle time much beneath them; or, as the Italian proverb runs, ‘the man\r\nwho lives by hope will die by hunger.’ It should be an indispensable\r\nrule in life to contract our desires to our present condition, and,\r\nwhatever may be our expectations, to live within the compass of what we\r\nactually possess. It will be time enough to enjoy an estate when it\r\ncomes into our hands; but if we anticipate our good fortune, we shall\r\nlose the pleasure of it when it arrives, and may possibly never possess\r\nwhat we have so foolishly counted upon.” We have quoted nearly at\r\nlength, and offer no excuse; for those who are familiar with the lesson\r\ncan do no harm by reading it anew, while those who are not may be\r\ntempted to dip deeper, and find in the pages of the _Spectator_ many new\r\ndelights. We can offer no remarks of our own on the superstitions of\r\n“adventurers” fit to be placed by those we have extracted, and so will\r\npass on to fresh incidents.\r\n\r\nLotteries abounded to such an extent about this time that we really have\r\ntoo much tempting material to choose from. There were the Greenwich\r\nHospital Adventure, sanctioned by Act of Parliament; the Land Lottery,\r\nthe promoter of which declared it was “found very difficult and\r\ntroublesome for the adventurers for to search and find out what prizes\r\nthey have come up in their number-tickets, from the badness of the\r\nprint, the many errors in them, and the great quantity of prizes;” as\r\nwell as the Twelvepenny, or Nonsuch, the Fortunatus, and the Deer\r\nLotteries, all flourishing; to say nothing of the smaller swindles,\r\nwhich, despite Parliament, were connived at by the minor authorities.\r\nThe Hamburgh Lottery caused in 1723 some trouble in the House of\r\nCommons. It was ostensibly a scheme for promoting trade between Great\r\nBritain and the Elbe territories, but was as gross an imposition as even\r\na lottery system could produce, and was ultimately suppressed by special\r\nAct, John Viscount Barrington being expelled the House for complicity in\r\nthe snare. He was not the only man of rank who dabbled with dirty water,\r\nmany members of the Commons being more or less openly convicted of fraud\r\nin connection with lotteries. George Robinson, Esq., member for Marlowe,\r\ndisappeared mysteriously in 1731, and it was found that with him went\r\nall the hopes of the Charitable Corporation Society, who discovered upon\r\ninvestigation that the half million capital they thought themselves\r\npossessed of had been embezzled. Two other M.P.’s, Sir Archibald Grant\r\nand Sir Robert Sutton, were found to be concerned, in common with many\r\nother persons of position, in the defalcation, and were expelled from\r\ntheir seats, while their property was attached. A lottery was instituted\r\nfor the benefit of the sufferers, and in 1734 they received nine\r\nshillings and ninepence in the pound. This is an advertisement published\r\nin the _Daily Courant_, July 1, 1734, with regard to the distribution of\r\nprizes in this same lottery:--\r\n\r\n  Lottery-Office, 28 June 1734.\r\n\r\n  _THE Managers appointed by an Act of Parliament for exchanging the\r\n  Tickets in the Charitable Corporation Lottery give Notice, That\r\n  Certificates for all Tickets in the said Lottery, which have been\r\n  entered at their Office in the New Palace Yard, near the Receipt of\r\n  his Majesty’s Exchequer, to the 29th Day of June, 1734, will be\r\n  delivered out at their said Office, in Exchange for the said Tickets,\r\n  on Wednesday and Thursday next, from Ten in the Forenoon ’till Two in\r\n  the Afternoon of each Day; and that the Business of taking in the\r\n  Tickets will be suspended ’till Friday the 5th Day of July._\r\n\r\n  _And whereas Tickets have been brought to be entered for Certificates,\r\n  that have been altered from Blanks to Numbers intituled to Benefits\r\n  (which Tickets have been detected) The Managers do hereby give Notice,\r\n  that the same is declared Felony by the Act._\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that sharpers of a description other than the\r\npromoters of lotteries were anxious to get all they could out of the\r\nventures, and so winning numbers were very often fabricated; and in more\r\nthan one instance the utterers being detected, were with the forgers\r\ntried and cast for death. A notable instance of this kind of fraud was\r\nmade public in 1777, in the January of which year two Jews, Joseph\r\nArones and Samuel Noah, were examined at Guildhall before the Lord\r\nMayor, charged with counterfeiting the lottery ticket No. 25,590, a\r\nprize of £2000, with intent to defraud Mr Keyser, an office-keeper, who\r\nhad examined the ticket carefully, and had taken it into the Stock\r\nExchange to sell, when Mr Shewell happened to come into the same box,\r\nand hearing the office-keeper’s offer, asked to look at the ticket, as\r\nhe recollected buying one of the same number a day or two before. This\r\nvery fortunately led to the discovery of the fraud, and the two Jews\r\nwere committed to take their trial. The number was so artfully altered\r\nfrom 23,590 that not the least erasure could be discerned. Arones was\r\nbut just come to England, and Noah was said to be a man of property. In\r\nthe February the two were tried at the Old Bailey for forgery and fraud.\r\nTheir defence was that Arones found the ticket, and persons were\r\nproduced to swear to the fact, which they did positively and\r\ncircumstantially, that the prisoners were discharged. At the same\r\nsessions Daniel Denny was tried for forging, counterfeiting, and\r\naltering a lottery ticket with intent to defraud; and being found\r\nguilty, was condemned. In later days the small cards given on\r\nrace-courses--and a few years back in the streets--by turf bookmakers to\r\ntheir customers were very successfully imitated, sometimes the number of\r\na ticket which was known to be held by a winner being counterfeited,\r\nwhile at others the brazen-visaged presenter would simply depend upon\r\nhis ability to “bounce” the layer of odds into the belief that the entry\r\nwas wrong as to the amount or name of horse. In these latter cases the\r\ningenuity exhibited was great--was in fact of the kind which judges are\r\nin the habit of instancing as worthy of better application. As if\r\njudges--and juries too, when they have sense--did not know that the only\r\noutlet for ability nine times out of ten in certain conditions of\r\nsociety is in a criminal direction. The kind of skill which brings a man\r\nto the Central Criminal Court is not likely to find much of an opening\r\nso far as money-getting is concerned, and from the ingenuity of the\r\ngreat bank-forgers of 1873, down to that of Counsellor Kelly and Jim the\r\nPenman of watch-robbery recollection, there is a wide field of skill for\r\nwhich virtue has small market, and which therefore turns to vice for its\r\nreward. We say this without any wish to be regarded as encouragers of\r\ncrime in any shape or form, but because we consider the words of the\r\njudge humbug, and the leaders in certain papers which always break out\r\nupon such occasions as we have referred to as cant of the most\r\nflagitious character. There is hardly a man now languishing in prison\r\nfor being ingenious who will not tell you that ingenuity has been his\r\nbane, not alone because he yielded to temptation, but because he found\r\nthe market overstocked with people quite as clever as himself who had\r\nadditional advantages. This simply proves that the ability which looks\r\nso great when it has been devoted to the purposes of robbery is of a\r\nvery small order after all, and shows itself in its true light when in\r\nits proper channel. What, if estimated at their proper value, were the\r\nqualifications of the American forgers or the English burglars? Are\r\nthere not scores of confidential clerks and dozens of skilled mechanics\r\nwho could have done as well or better than either if they had chosen so\r\nto do? Yes, decidedly. Yet in both cases, as well as in many others, the\r\njudge and jury, the public and the press, affected to be horror-struck\r\nat such a waste of talent. But, as they say in the novels, this is a\r\ndigression.\r\n\r\nIn 1736 an Act was passed to build Westminster Bridge by means of a\r\nlottery, and by means of advertisement the following scheme was\r\nsubmitted to the public:--\r\n\r\n  LOTTERY 1736, _for raising 100000l. for building a Bridge at_\r\n  Westminster, _consisting of 125000 Tickets at 5l. each_.\r\n\r\n  Prizes 1    of    20000_l._    is    20000_l._\r\n         2    „     10000        „     20000\r\n         3    „      5000        „     15000\r\n        10    „      3000        „     30000\r\n        40    „      1000        „     40000\r\n        60    „       500        „     30000\r\n       100    „       200        „     20000\r\n       200    „       100        „     20000\r\n       400    „        50        „     20000\r\n      1000    „        20        „     20000\r\n     28800    „        10        „    288000\r\n    ------                            ------\r\n     30616 Prizes, amounting to       523000\r\n     94384 Blanks.\r\n           First Drawn                  1000\r\n           Last Drawn                   1000\r\n    ------                            ------\r\n    125000                            525000\r\n    ------                            ------\r\n\r\n  The Prizes to be paid at the Bank in 40 Days after Drawing, without\r\n  Deduction. N.B. _There is little more than Three_ Blanks _to a_ Prize.\r\n\r\nOther lotteries were granted for the same purpose before the bridge was\r\ncompleted. Its structure must have been as rotten as the system on which\r\nit was built, as for many years before it was pulled down it was a\r\ndisgrace to the neighbourhood; and as it was anything but old when it\r\nwas demolished, it must have gone to decay almost as soon as it was\r\nopened. Almost every imaginable article was at this period disposed of\r\nby raffle or lottery, and Horace Walpole, writing about one for an\r\norgan, says: “I am now in pursuit of getting the finest piece of music\r\nthat ever was heard; it is a thing that will play eight tunes. Handel\r\nand all the great musicians say, that it is beyond anything they can do;\r\nand this may be performed by the most ignorant person; and when you are\r\nweary of those eight tunes, you may have them changed for any other that\r\nyou like. This I think much better than going to an Italian opera or an\r\nassembly. This performance has been lately put into a lottery, and all\r\nthe royal family choose to have a great many tickets rather than to buy\r\nit, the price being I think £1000, infinitely a less sum than some\r\nbishoprics have been sold for. And a gentleman won it, who I am in hopes\r\nwill sell it, and if he will, I will buy it, for I cannot live to have\r\nanother made, and I will carry it into the country with me.” As Walpole\r\nlived for sixty years after this, he must have lived to see much more\r\nwonderful instruments built, and possibly offered as prizes in\r\nlotteries. In June 1743 the price of lottery tickets rose from £10 to\r\n£11, 10s., the prizes being in no way increased, and a hint to the\r\nunwary was published, in which it was shown that adventurers “gamed at\r\n50 per cent. loss; paying at that price 2s. 6d. to play for 5s.; the\r\nmoney played for being only three pound, besides discount and\r\ndeductions.” The practice of giving £1000 each to the first and last\r\ndrawn tickets led to a curious difficulty in 1774. On the 5th of\r\nJanuary, at the conclusion of drawing the State Lottery at Guildhall,\r\nNo. 11,053, as the last-drawn ticket, was declared to be entitled to the\r\nthousand pounds, and was so printed in the paper of benefits by order of\r\nthe commissioners. It was, beside, a prize of a hundred pounds. But\r\nafter the wheels were carried back to Whitehall, and there opened, the\r\nticket No. 72,248 was found sticking in a crevice of the wheel. And,\r\nbeing the next-drawn ticket after all the prizes were drawn, was\r\nadvertised by the commissioners’ order as entitled to the thousand\r\npounds, as the last-drawn ticket; “which affair,” we are told by the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_, “made a great deal of noise.” The State Lottery\r\nof 1751 met with much opposition from the press, and an article in the\r\n_London Magazine_ gives the following computation of its chances:--\r\n\r\nIN THE LOTTERY 1751 IT IS\r\n\r\n  69998 to     2 or 34999 to 1 against a £10000 Prize\r\n  69994 to     6 or 11665 to 1 against a   5000 or upwards\r\n  69989 to    11 or  6363 to 1 against a   3000\r\n  69981 to    19 or  3683 to 1 against a   2000\r\n  69961 to    39 or  1794 to 1 against a   1000\r\n  69920 to    80 or   874 to 1 against a    500\r\n  69720 to   280 or   249 to 1 against a    100\r\n  69300 to   700 or    99 to 1 against a     50\r\n  60000 to 10000 or     6 to 1 against a     20 or any Prize.\r\n\r\nThe writer then goes on to say: “I would beg the favour of all\r\ngentlemen, tradesmen, and others, to take the pains to explain to such\r\nas any way depend upon their judgment, that one must buy no less than\r\nseven tickets to have an even chance for any prize at all; that with\r\nonly one ticket it is six to one, and with half a ticket twelve to one,\r\nagainst any prize; and ninety-nine or a hundred to one that the prize,\r\nif it comes, will not be above £50; and no less than thirty-five\r\nthousand to one that the owner of a single ticket will not obtain one of\r\nthe greatest prizes. No lottery is proper for persons of very small\r\nfortunes, to whom the loss of five or six pounds is of great\r\nconsequence, besides the disturbance of their minds; much less is it\r\nadvisable or desirable for either poor or rich to contribute to the\r\nexorbitant tax of more than two hundred thousand pounds, which the first\r\nengrossers of lottery tickets, and the brokers and dealers, strive to\r\nraise out of the pockets of the poor chiefly, and the silly rich partly,\r\nby artfully enhancing the price of tickets above the original cost.” The\r\nfirst price of tickets in this lottery was ten pounds. On their rise a\r\nMr Holland publicly offered in an advertisement to wager four hundred\r\nguineas that four hundred tickets when drawn did not amount to nine\r\npounds fifteen shillings on an average, prizes and blanks. As might have\r\nbeen expected, his challenge was never accepted. On the 11th of the next\r\nmonth (November) the drawing began, and notwithstanding the\r\npublic-spirited efforts of individuals, societies, and papers which did\r\nnot receive any benefit in the way of advertisements, to check the\r\nexorbitancy of the ticket-mongers, the price rose steadily and\r\nultimately to sixteen guineas a ticket. All means were tried by the\r\ndisinterested to cure this infatuation by writing and advertising; and\r\non the first day of drawing, it was publicly averred that near eight\r\nthousand tickets were in the South Sea House, and upwards of thirty\r\nthousand pawned at bankers, &c., that nine out of ten of the\r\nticket-holders were not able to go to the wheel, and that not one of\r\nthem durst stand the drawing above six days. These dealers seem to have\r\nhad an awkward knack of selling the same ticket to two buyers, or\r\ndisposing of more than the proper fractional parts of one ticket, in the\r\nhope of its turning up a blank, thus “going for the gloves” in a style\r\nimitated in modern days by votaries of Tattersall’s and other betting\r\ninstitutions with much success. This arrangement, with others of a\r\nsimilar nature, led to the establishment of insurances offices, which,\r\nat first an ostensible protection by guaranteeing special numbers, and\r\nthereby preventing fraud on the part of sellers, became in time greater\r\nswindles than those they were supposed to prevent.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the monopoly of tickets in the State Lottery, and the\r\nconsequent upheaval of rates, it had been enacted that persons charged\r\nwith the delivery of tickets should not sell more than twenty to one\r\nperson. This provision was evaded by the use of pretended lists, which\r\ndefeated the object of Parliament, and injured public credit, insomuch\r\nthat in 1754 more tickets were subscribed for than the holders of the\r\nlists had cash to purchase, and there was a deficiency in the first\r\npayment. The mischief and notoriety of these practices occasioned the\r\nHouse of Commons to prosecute an inquiry into the circumstances, which,\r\nthough opposed by a scandalous cabal that endeavoured to screen the\r\ndelinquents, ended in a report, by the committee, that Peter Leheup,\r\nEsq., had privately disposed of a great number of tickets before the\r\noffice was opened to which the public were directed by advertisement to\r\napply; that he also delivered great numbers to particular persons, upon\r\nlists of names which he knew to be fictitious; and that, in particular,\r\nSampson Gideon became proprietor of more than six thousand, which he\r\nsold at a premium. Upon report of these and other illegal acts, the\r\nHouse resolved that Leheup was guilty of a violation of the Act and a\r\nbreach of trust, and presented an address to his Majesty praying that he\r\nwould direct the Attorney-General to prosecute him in the most effectual\r\nmanner for his offences. An information was accordingly filed, and, on a\r\ntrial at bar in the Court of King’s Bench, Leheup, as one of the\r\nreceivers of the last lottery of three hundred thousand pounds, was\r\nfound guilty (1) of receiving subscriptions before the day and hour\r\nadvertised; (2) of permitting the subscribers to use different names to\r\ncover an excess of twenty tickets; and (3) of disposing of the tickets\r\nwhich had been bespoke, and not claimed, or were double charged, instead\r\nof returning them to the managers. In Trinity Term, Leheup was brought\r\nup for judgment, and fined a thousand pounds, which was at once paid.\r\nThis was one of the grossest miscarriages of justice known with regard\r\nto the lottery frauds, as in the course of the evidence given it was\r\ndiscovered that the defendant had amassed by his trickery over forty\r\nthousand pounds for his own share. Another instance of the horrible\r\neffect these instruments of gambling had on the public mind is found in\r\nthe madness of many successful speculators, as well as in the continuous\r\nsuicides of the unsuccessful. On November 5, 1757, Mr Keys, a clerk, who\r\nhad absented himself from business ever since the 7th of October, on\r\nwhich day was drawn the ten-thousand-pound prize, supposed to be his\r\nproperty, was found in the streets raving mad, having been robbed of his\r\npocket-book and ticket.\r\n\r\nThe very small parts into which shares were divided more than a hundred\r\nyears ago is shown by the following advertisement, published in several\r\npapers of November 1766:--\r\n\r\n  DAME FORTUNE presents her Respects to the Public, and assures them\r\n  that she has fixed her Residence for the Present at CORBETT’S State\r\n  Lottery Office, opposite St. Dunstan’s Church, Fleet Street; and, to\r\n  enable many Families to partake of her Favours, she has ordered not\r\n  only the Tickets to be sold at the lowest Prices, but also that they\r\n  be _divided into Shares at the following low Rates_,--viz.:--\r\n\r\n                    £   _s._  _d._\r\n  A Sixty-fourth    0     4     0\r\n  Thirty-second     0     7     6\r\n  Sixteenth         0    15     0\r\n  An Eighth         1    10     0\r\n  A Fourth          3     0     0\r\n  A Half            6     0     0\r\n\r\n  By which may be gained from upwards of one hundred and fifty to\r\n  upwards of five thousand Guineas, at her said Office No. 30.\r\n\r\nAs another instance of the superstition prevalent during the lottery\r\nmania we will give the following anecdote, which though old will bear\r\nrepetition. A gentlewoman whose husband had presented her with a ticket,\r\nput up prayers in the church, the day before drawing, in the following\r\nmanner: “The prayers of the congregation are desired for the success of\r\na person engaged in a new undertaking.” Lottery tickets were often\r\npresented by gentlemen to ladies, and it is recorded that a lady falling\r\nin love with an actor, finding that the many letters of passionate\r\nadmiration she sent him passed unnoticed, accompanied one of them with a\r\ngift of four lottery tickets. Whether they were successful, either as\r\nregards moving his obdurate heart or providing him with a prize, we are\r\nunfortunately not able to say. Anyhow, it doesn’t much matter, as the\r\nrecipient of the favours died shortly afterwards; and most likely the\r\nunknown lady consoled herself with another and more willing lover, or\r\nelse with a lottery.\r\n\r\nBetween 1770 and 1775 the tricks of the insurers occupied a great deal\r\nof attention, and almost left the ordinary office-keepers unnoticed. The\r\ntwo businesses were, however, pretty well mixed up by this time. An\r\nimportant trial took place at Guildhall for the purpose of deciding the\r\nlegality of insuring on March 1, 1773, the Lord Mayor being plaintiff,\r\nand Messrs Barnes & Golightly defendants, but on account of an error in\r\nthe declaration the plaintiff was nonsuited. On June 26, 1775, a cause\r\ncame on in the Court of Common Pleas, Guildhall, between a gentleman,\r\nplaintiff, and a lottery office-keeper, defendant. The cause of the\r\naction was, that the gentleman, passing by the lottery office, observed\r\na woman and a boy crying, on which he asked the reason of their tears.\r\nThey informed him that they had insured a number in the lottery on the\r\novernight, and upon inquiry at another office, found it to have been\r\ndrawn five days before, and therefore wanted their money returned. The\r\ngentleman taking their part was assaulted and beaten by the\r\noffice-keeper, and the jury, after hearing the evidence, gave a verdict\r\nin favour of the gentleman with five pounds damages.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 some of the Bluecoat boys appointed to assist in the drawing of\r\nthe State Lottery were tampered with for the purpose of inducing them to\r\ncommit a fraud. These attempts were successful in one instance that\r\nbecame known, and doubtless in many others that did not. This discovery\r\nled to certain regulations, which were carried out with great vigour. On\r\nthe 1st of June a man was brought before the Lord Mayor for attempting\r\nto bribe the two boys who drew the Museum Lottery at Guildhall to\r\nconceal a ticket, and to bring it to him, promising that he would at\r\nonce return it. His intention was to insure it in all the offices with a\r\nview to defraud the keepers. The boys were so frightened at the\r\nproposition that they gave notice to the managers of the lottery, and\r\npointed out the delinquent, who was, however, discharged, as there was\r\nno law by which to punish him. On the 5th of December another of the\r\nboys engaged to draw the numbers in the State Lottery at Guildhall was\r\nexamined before Sir Charles Asgill relative to a number that had been\r\ndrawn out the Friday before, on which an assurance had been made in\r\nalmost every office in London. The boy confessed that he was prevailed\r\nupon to conceal the ticket No. 21,481, by a man who paid him for so\r\ndoing; that the man copied the number; and that the next day he followed\r\nthe man’s instructions, and put his hand into the wheel as usual, with\r\nthe ticket in it, and then pretended to draw it from among the rest. The\r\ninstigator of the offence had actually received £400 of the\r\ninsurance-office keepers. Had all of them paid him, the whole sum would\r\nhave amounted to £3000; but some of them suspected a fraud had been\r\ncommitted, and caused the inquiry which led to the boy’s confessing both\r\nthe temptation and his folly. On the next day the man who insured the\r\nticket was examined. He was clerk to a hop-factor in Goodman’s Fields;\r\nbut not being the person who had persuaded the boy to secrete the ticket\r\nand pretend to draw it in the usual manner, and no evidence appearing to\r\nconnect him with the actual seducer, the prisoner was discharged, though\r\nit was ascertained that he had insured the number already mentioned\r\nninety-one times in one day. In consequence of the circumstances which\r\nled to this examination, the Lords of the Treasury inquired further and\r\ndeliberated on the means of preventing a recurrence of such\r\ntransactions. The result of their conference was the following order,\r\nwhich was, however, but privately circulated, and was never published in\r\nany periodical, book, or newspaper until after the abolition of\r\nLotteries:--\r\n\r\n  ORDER _of December 12, 1775_.\r\n\r\n  A DISCOVERY having been made that WILLIAM TRAMPLETT, one of the Boys\r\n  employed in drawing the Lottery had, at the Instigation of one CHARLES\r\n  LOWNDES, (since absconded) at different Times in former Rolls, _taken\r\n  out of the Number Wheel_ THREE _numbered Tickets, which were at_ THREE\r\n  _several Times returned by him into the said Wheel, and drawn without\r\n  his parting with them_, so as to give them the Appearance of being\r\n  fairly drawn _to answer the purpose of defrauding by insurance_:\r\n\r\n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, for preventing the like wicked Practices in\r\n  future, that every Boy, before he is suffered to put his Hand into\r\n  either Wheel, be brought by the Proclaimer to the Managers on Duty,\r\n  for them to see that _the Bosoms and Sleeves of his Coat be closely\r\n  buttoned, his Pockets sewed up, and his Hands examined_; and that\r\n  during the Time of his being on Duty, _he shall keep his left Hand in\r\n  his Girdle behind him, and his right Hand open with his Fingers\r\n  extended_; and the Proclaimer is not to suffer him at any Time to\r\n  leave the Wheel, without being first examined by the Manager nearest\r\n  him.\r\n\r\n  The Observance of the foregoing Order is recommended by the Managers\r\n  on this Roll to those on the succeeding Rolls, till the matter shall\r\n  be more fully discussed at a general Meeting.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that though only one ticket was spoken of in the police\r\ncase, the secret instructions refer to three. It is likely that if it\r\nhad been known that more than one had been tampered with, a general\r\nunpleasantness would have resulted, and the whole of the drawing been\r\ndeclared null and void. As it was, there was some difficulty in keeping\r\nthe matter within bounds; and the trifling proportion of the attempted\r\ncheat, as compared with the magnitude of the general issue, was the\r\nstrong point of the lottery managers. The exposure of the attempted, and\r\nso far as two tickets were concerned apparently successful, fraud, would\r\nhave led to a vast amount of trouble and expense, and would have\r\nconsiderably added to the unpopularity of lotteries--a feeling which, as\r\nit was, made itself now and again very manifest. Anyhow the secret was\r\nkept for over sixty years, as it was never divulged until the general\r\ndissolution of the lottery system in 1826, when the following on the\r\nsame subject was also for the first time made public:--\r\n\r\n  ORDER _at_ GENERAL MEETING.\r\n\r\n  A PLAN OF RULES AND REGULATIONS to be observed in order _to prevent\r\n  the Boys committing Frauds, &c._, in the Drawing of the Lottery,\r\n  agreeable to _Directions_ received by Mr. Johnson on Tuesday the 16th\r\n  of January 1776, from the LORDS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n  THAT ten Managers be always on the Roll at Guildhall, two of whom are\r\n  to be conveniently placed opposite the two Boys at the Wheels, in\r\n  order to observe that they strictly conform themselves to the Rules\r\n  and Orders directed by the Committee at Guildhall, on Tuesday,\r\n  December 12, 1775.\r\n\r\n  THAT _it be requested of the_ TREASURER OF CHRIST’S HOSPITAL _not to\r\n  make known who are the twelve Boys nominated for drawing the Lottery\r\n  till the morning the Drawing begins; which said Boys are all to attend\r\n  every Day, and the two who are to go on Duty at the Wheels are to be\r\n  taken promiscuously from amongst the whole Number_ by either of the\r\n  Secretaries, _without observing any regular Course or Order; so that\r\n  no Boy shall know when it will be his turn to go to either Wheel_.\r\n\r\n  THIS METHOD, though attended with considerable additional Expense, by\r\n  the extra Attendance of two Managers and six Boys, will, it is\r\n  presumed, effectually prevent any Attempt being made to corrupt or\r\n  bribe any of the Boys to commit the Fraud practised in the last\r\n  Lottery.\r\n\r\nIn July 1778 there was tried before Lord Mansfield at Guildhall a case\r\nwherein a merchant was plaintiff and a lottery-office keeper defendant.\r\nThe action was for the purpose of recovering damages against the\r\noffice-keeper for suffering plaintiff’s apprentice, a youth, to insure\r\nduring the drawing of the last lottery, contrary to the statute; whereby\r\nthe lad lost a considerable sum, the property of his master. The jury,\r\nwithout leaving their box, gave a verdict for the plaintiff, and the\r\njudge ordered the defendant to pay £500 penalty and be imprisoned for\r\nthree months. During the same year, Parliament having discussed the evil\r\nof insuring, and the mischievous subdivision of the shares of tickets,\r\npassed an Act for the regulation of lottery offices, by which it was\r\nenacted that every office-keeper should pay £50 for a licence, and give\r\ntangible security not to infringe any part of the Act; that no smaller\r\nportion of any ticket than a sixteenth should be disposed of under a\r\npenalty of £50; that any person disposing of goods or merchandise upon\r\nany chance relating to the drawing of any ticket should be liable to a\r\nfine of £20; and that all shares should be stamped at an office\r\nestablished under the said Act, the original tickets being kept at the\r\noffice till after the drawing. Many other regulations were made in the\r\nsame law, and in the following year the question was again subject of\r\nlegislation; but notwithstanding all the efforts of the Commons, the\r\nruinous practice of insuring was still conducted with dexterity and\r\ngreat profit by the office-keepers. This is one of their plans for\r\nevading the law:--\r\n\r\n  _November 7, 1781._\r\n\r\n  MODE OF INSURANCE,\r\n\r\n  WHICH continues the whole Time of drawing the Lottery, at CARRICK’S\r\n  STATE LOTTERY OFFICE, King’s Arms, 72, Threadneedle Street. _At one\r\n  Guinea each_ NUMBERS _are taken_, to return three Twenty Pound Prizes,\r\n  value Sixty Pounds, for every given Number that shall be drawn any\r\n  Prize whatever above Twenty Pounds during the whole drawing.\r\n\r\n  ⁂ _Numbers at half a Guinea to receive half the above._\r\n\r\nAnd here is another of about the same date, which openly violates the\r\nspirit if not the letter of the law:--\r\n\r\n  J. COOK respectfully solicits the Public will favour the following\r\n  _incomparably advantageous plan_ with attention, by which _upwards of\r\n  thirty-two thousand Chances for obtaining a Prize (out of the\r\n  forty-eight thousand Tickets) are given in one Policy_.\r\n\r\n  POLICIES OF FIVE GUINEAS _with three Numbers_, with the first Number\r\n  will gain\r\n\r\n  20000  if a Prize of   £20000\r\n  10000         „        £10000\r\n  5000          „         £5000\r\n\r\n  _with the second Number_ will gain\r\n\r\n  6000   guineas if   20000\r\n  3000       „        10000\r\n  1500       „         5000\r\n\r\n  _with the third Number_ will gain\r\n\r\n  3000   guineas if   20000\r\n  1500       „        10000\r\n  1200       „         5000\r\n\r\nThen follow the address and other tempting inducements. In 1781 an Act\r\nwas passed to prevent the insurance of tickets by any method. The\r\noffice-keepers continued to insure notwithstanding, and many\r\nprosecutions resulted; but as the profits were greater than the fines,\r\nbusiness continued to run briskly. One man was in 1784 fined fifteen\r\nhundred pounds, and he brought an action in 1785 to recover the money\r\nfrom the sheriff who had levied the amount on his goods. The case was\r\ntried in the Court of King’s Bench, and ended in an almost immediate\r\nnonsuit. In February 1793 the Commissioners of the Lottery, in order to\r\nabate insuring, determined that no persons should be suffered to take\r\ndown numbers except the clerks of licensed offices known to the\r\nCommissioners. No slips were to be sent out; but the numbers were to be\r\ntaken down by one clerk in one book; Steel’s list of lottery numbers was\r\nto be abolished, and a recompense made for it; and the magistrates\r\nresolved to apprehend all suspicious persons who should be seen taking\r\nearly numbers. Yet in 1796 there was a class of sharpers who took\r\nlottery insurances, and this gambling among the higher and middle\r\nclasses was carried on to an extent exceeding all credibility, producing\r\nconsequences to many private families of great worth and respectability,\r\nof the most distressing nature.\r\n\r\nThe insurance offices in London numbered over four hundred. To many of\r\nthem persons were attached called Morocco men, who went from house to\r\nhouse among their customers, or attended in the back parlours of\r\npublic-houses, for the purpose of making insurances. It was calculated\r\nthat at these offices (exclusive of what was done at the licensed\r\noffices) insurances were made to the extent of eight hundred thousand\r\npounds, in premiums, during the Irish Lottery, and above one million\r\nduring the English, upon which it was calculated that the insurers made\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty-five per cent. profit. This confederacy, during\r\nthe English Lottery of the year 1796, supported about two thousand\r\nagents and clerks, and nearly eight thousand Morocco men, “including a\r\nconsiderable number of ruffians and bludgeon men, paid by a general\r\nassociation of the principal proprietors of the establishments, who\r\nregularly met in committee in a well-known public-house in Oxford\r\nMarket, twice or thrice a week during the drawing of the lottery, for\r\nthe purpose of concerting measures to defeat the exertions of the\r\nmagistrates by forcibly resisting or bribing the officers of justice.”\r\n\r\nLotteries were declared by the Parliamentary reports of 1807 to be\r\ninseparable from illegal insurances. The reports further state that “the\r\nLottery is so radically vicious, that under no system of regulations\r\nwhich can be devised will it be possible for Parliament to adopt it as\r\nan efficient source of revenue, and at the same time divest it of all\r\nthe evils and calamities of which it has hitherto been so baneful a\r\nsource.” Among these evils and calamities the Committees of Parliament\r\nenumerate that “idleness, dissipation, and poverty were increased,--the\r\nmost sacred and confidential trusts were betrayed,--domestic comfort was\r\ndestroyed, madness was often created, suicide itself was produced, and\r\ncrimes subjecting the perpetrators of them to death were committed.” Sir\r\nNathaniel Conant, who in 1816 was chief magistrate of Bow Street, stated\r\nto a committee of the House of Commons that the Lottery was one of the\r\npredisposing causes by which the people of the metropolis were vitiated;\r\nthat it led to theft, to supply losses and disappointments occasioned by\r\nspeculating on its chances; and that illegal insurances continued to be\r\neffected. “There are,” he says, “people in the background, who, having\r\ngot forty or fifty thousand pounds by that, employ people of the lowest\r\norder, and give them a commission for what they bring; there is, _a\r\nwheel within a wheel_.” Another magistrate giving evidence before the\r\nsame committee, said, “It is a scandal to the Government, thus to excite\r\npeople to practise the vice of gaming for the purpose of drawing a\r\nrevenue from their ruin. It is an anomalous proceeding by law to declare\r\ngambling infamous; to hunt out petty gamblers in their recesses, and\r\ncast them into prison; and by law also to set up the giant gambling of\r\nthe State Lottery, and encourage persons to resort to it by the most\r\ncaptivating devices which ingenuity uncontrolled by moral rectitude can\r\ninvent.” This evidence may be regarded as the ultimate cause of the\r\nsuppression of lotteries, which might have dragged on an existence for a\r\nfew more years had it not been for the atrocities of the\r\ninsurance-mongers. We will now turn towards the closing scenes in this\r\neventful drama.\r\n\r\nSeldom was human ingenuity more exercised than in giving public\r\nnotoriety to lottery schemes. The originators or proprietors of\r\nlotteries used to employ a number of persons, frequently of considerable\r\nliterary ability and talent, to attract the public attention by verses,\r\ningenious advertisements, and decoy paragraphs in the newspapers,\r\nengaging the attention of the readers by smart allusions to political\r\ntopics or other matters of interest, which entrapped the unwary into\r\nlottery puffs. Thirteen thousand pounds was usually paid into the\r\nExchequer for duties on these and other methods of advertising practised\r\nby the lottery people, and some of the agents spent as much as £20,000\r\nin puffing and advertisements. Take the following as a specimen of the\r\npuffing which marked the later days of the Lottery:--\r\n\r\n  Before the time of Sir Isaac Newton, various notions were entertained\r\n  concerning colours. Plato said colour was a flame issuing from bodies,\r\n  the Indians of America believed the same, and when any person read a\r\n  letter they believed it spoke, and blessed the paper in proportion as\r\n  they were moved by it. What emotions would the following billet\r\n  excite? “The bearer may receive one hundred thousand pounds.” This\r\n  would make a deep impression on the natives of every country, and may\r\n  now be realised; for by the present Grand Lottery a single ticket may\r\n  bestow on the Bearer One Hundred Thousand Pounds.\r\n\r\nHere is another of the same ingenious description, which kept the trap\r\nconstantly baited for the unsuspecting:--\r\n\r\n  DUEL.--On Friday last a meeting took place near Plymouth, between\r\n  Capt. G---- and Lieut. R----, both of the Royal Navy, when, after\r\n  exchanging shots, happily without effect, the seconds interfered and\r\n  amicably adjusted the dispute. The following is said to have been the\r\n  cause of the duel:--Lieut. R---- had dreamt three successive nights\r\n  that a certain number would be a prize of £3000, in the ensuing\r\n  lottery, which he mentioned to Captain G----, but never intimated any\r\n  intention of having that ticket; he, however, wrote up to his agent in\r\n  London to procure it, who found the Captain was beforehand with him,\r\n  as he had got it the day before, and refused to give it up. By the\r\n  intercession of the seconds, it is settled that they are each to have\r\n  half the ticket, and as they are both very meritorious officers, we\r\n  sincerely wish they may have one of the numerous Capital Prizes with\r\n  which the scheme abounds.\r\n\r\nThe most stupendous efforts were made to promote the success of the last\r\nlottery, which, however, languished sadly. The price of tickets was\r\narbitrarily raised, to induce a belief that they were in great demand,\r\n“at the very moment when,” says Hone, writing immediately afterwards,\r\n“their sale was notoriously at a stand; and the lagging attention of the\r\npublic of the metropolis was endeavoured to be quickened by all sorts of\r\nstratagems to the 18th of July, as the very last chance that would occur\r\nin England of gaining ‘Six 30,000_l._ besides other Capitals,’ which it\r\nwas positively affirmed were ‘all to be drawn’ on that fatal day.”\r\nBesides the dispersion of innumerable bills and aspersions on Government\r\nfor extinguishing the Lottery, those most interested in its preservation\r\ncaused London and the suburbs to be paraded by a most magnificent\r\nprocession, in which was a band of music which played to attract\r\nattention, and then a man stepped forward, and ringing a bell, announced\r\nthe death of the Lottery. Cartloads of bills were showered down areas\r\nand thrust under doors, and no effort was spared to make the end crown\r\nthe work of centuries.\r\n\r\nChief among the office-keepers of the period was a Mr T. Bish--one of\r\nwhose earlier prospectuses we present in exact facsimile--who showered\r\nmillions of bills and miles of doggerel verse upon London just before\r\nthe final draw took place. He had been a considerable adept in the art\r\nof puffing by means of the mock news-paragraphs to which reference has\r\njust been made, one of his best being that which follows:--\r\n\r\n  A laughable circumstance occurred at the Opera House a few evenings\r\n  since. The Honourable Mrs H---- C---- in the confusion that takes\r\n  place in the lobby on quitting the theatre, dropped her reticule, and\r\n  was some minutes before she regained it; when on looking at its\r\n  contents she exclaimed: “I have lost my duplicates!” This created\r\n  surprise, not that the company had any doubt when the lady pledged her\r\n  word, but they thought she had pledged her jewels. However, on\r\n  enquiry, it was found that the lost duplicates were Two Tickets of one\r\n  number (which she had purchased that evening) in the Lottery to be\r\n  drawn the next Tuesday; luckily she soon after found them, and\r\n  anticipates getting £20,000, as she had procured them at Bish’s\r\n  well-known office, Charing Cross.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  If U R\r\n  a man struggling to get through the world\r\n  or surrounded by crosses\r\n  or if you wish to lay\r\n  by a Fortune for your\r\n  Children\r\n  go to Bish or his Agents\r\n  WHO MAY MAKE YOU\r\n  independent and above the frowns of the world\r\n\r\n  By the purchase of a Ticket or Share in the New Lottery, to be all\r\n  drawn in Two Days, 5^{th} and 18^{th} OCTOBER.

Bish being “the last\r\n  man” who appears singly, has been particularly anxious to make an\r\n  excellent scheme, and flatters himself the one he has the honour to\r\n  submit must meet universal approbation.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the bill were some verses after the style of the\r\n“Cajolery Duet.” This is one of them:--\r\n\r\n  TO-DAY, OR NOT AT ALL.\r\n\r\n  _Run Neighbours, Run!_\r\n\r\n          Run, neighbours, run! To-day it is the Lott’ry draws,\r\n            You still may be in time if your purse be low;\r\n          Rhino, we all know, will stop of poverty the flaws.\r\n            Possessed of that, you’ll find no one to serve you slow.\r\n    The ministers in Parliament of lotteries have toll’d the knell,\r\n    And have declared from Cooper’s Hall dame Fortune soon they will\r\n      expel;\r\n    The Blue-coat boys no more will shout that they have drawn a\r\n      capital!\r\n    Nor run as though their necks they’d break to _Lucky Bish_ the news\r\n      to tell.\r\n                                      Run, neighbours, run, &c.\r\n\r\nAlthough the last lottery was expected to take place on the 18th of\r\nJuly, it was not until the 18th of October that the closing scene in an\r\neventful history took place. For this Bish, among many other handbills,\r\nproduced the following:--\r\n\r\n  THE AMBULATOR’S GUIDE\r\n  TO THE LAND OF PLENTY.\r\n\r\n  BY PURCHASING A TICKET\r\n  _in the present Lottery_\r\n\r\n  You may _reap_ a golden _harvest_ in _Cornhill_, and pick up the\r\n  _bullion_ in _Silver_-street, have an interest in _Bank-buildings_,\r\n  possess a _Mansion-house_ in _Golden-square_, and an estate like a\r\n  _Little Britain_; never be in _Hunger_ford-market, but all your life\r\n  continue a _Mayfair_.\r\n\r\n  BY PURCHASING A HALF,\r\n\r\n  You need never be confined within _London Wall_, but become the\r\n  proprietor of many a _Long Acre_; represent a _Borough_ or an\r\n  _Aldermanbury_, and have a share in _Threadneedle-street_.\r\n\r\n  BY PURCHASING A QUARTER,\r\n\r\n  Your affairs need never be in _Crooked-lane_, nor your legs in\r\n  _Fetter-lane_; you may avoid _Paper-buildings_, steer clear of the\r\n  _King’s Bench_, and defy the _Marshalsea_; if your heart is in\r\n  _Love-lane_ you may soon get into _Sweeting’s Alley_, obtain your\r\n  lover’s consent for _Matrimony-place_, and always live in a\r\n  _High-street_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADVERTISING THE LAST STATE LOTTERY DRAWN IN ENGLAND.\r\n1826.]\r\n\r\n  BY PURCHASING AN EIGHTH,\r\n\r\n  You may secure plenty of _provision_ for _Swallow-street_; finger the\r\n  _Cole_ in _Coleman-street_; and may never be troubled with\r\n  _Chancery-lane_. You may cast _anchor_ in _Cable-street_; set up\r\n  business in a _Fore-street_; and need never be confined within a\r\n  _Narrow-wall_.\r\n\r\n  BY PURCHASING A SIXTEENTH,\r\n\r\n  You may live _frugal_ in _Cheapside_; get merry in\r\n  _Liquorpond-street_; soak your _hide_ in _Leather-lane_; be a _wet\r\n  sole_ in _Shoe-lane_; turn _maltster_ in _Beer-lane_, or _hammer_ away\r\n  in _Smithfield_.\r\n\r\n  In short, life must indeed be a _Long-lane_ if it’s without a\r\n  _turning_. Therefore, if you are wise, without _Mincing_ the matter,\r\n  go _Pall-mall_ to _Cornhill_ or _Charing-cross_, and enroll your name\r\n  in the _Temple_ of Fortune,\r\n\r\n  BISH’S.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements in the newspapers were not, however, plentiful. The\r\noffice-keepers seemed to prefer the pomp and circumstance of processions\r\nand bands and funeral speeches, to the cold respectability which was\r\njust then part of the newspaper system. Bish had many eccentric\r\nillustrations in his handbills, and some of his verses went beyond even\r\nthe bounds of eccentricity. As the eventful day approached, the efforts\r\nin the handbill line redoubled, and people were provided with waste\r\npaper for an indefinite period; but there was little to notice in the\r\ncolumns of any of the chief journals. On October 7, 1826, a public\r\nnotice appeared on the front page of the _Times_, in company with the\r\nadvertisements of Swift and Eyton, two office-keepers; but whether it\r\nwas placed there by order of the “powers that be,” or was in the\r\ninterests of the dealers, we must leave our readers to judge for\r\nthemselves. The latter seems most probable:--\r\n\r\n  PUBLIC NOTICE.--The Licenses granted by 4th Geo. IV. cap. 60, to the\r\n  Lottery-office-keepers, to sell and divide into shares State Lottery\r\n  Tickets, will cease and determine on Wednesday the 18th of this month,\r\n  when all the Six Prizes of £30,000, and every other prize, amounting\r\n  to £389,000, must be decided, and all Lotteries end in this kingdom.\r\n  Government, having already given extra time for the sale of tickets,\r\n  will not grant an hour beyond the 18th instant.\r\n\r\nHazard was the rather appropriate name of another promoter whose\r\nadvertisements are published just at this time; but they are, as are the\r\nothers, small and unpretentious when in the newspapers, and are only\r\nnoticeable as records of the finishing days of the great State Lottery.\r\nIn the _Times_ of October 13 there is this notice, which was repeated on\r\nthe 16th and 17th, on the last-named date having the word “to-morrow”\r\ninserted instead of “next Wednesday:”--\r\n\r\n  DRAWING of the LOTTERY.--Whereas it is maliciously asserted by an\r\n  Anonymous Correspondent in the Morning Chronicle of this day, that\r\n  application would be made to the Lords of the Treasury for a further\r\n  Postponement of the Lottery, the Public are most unequivocally and\r\n  positively assured by the Contractors that no such application has\r\n  been made, nor even contemplated; but on the contrary, it is\r\n  absolutely and inevitably determined by Government, that this last of\r\n  all lotteries shall and must be decided NEXT WEDNESDAY, 18th instant.\r\n\r\nOn the day before the drawing, the advertisements in the _Times_ showed\r\nthat great apathy existed, and that the tickets had not gone off well,\r\nas the office-keepers had evidently many yet left on hand. Even the\r\nadvertisements have a dispirited appearance:--\r\n\r\n  FINISH of LOTTERIES.--SWIFT and Co. respectfully inform the Public\r\n  that the last and only day of drawing the STATE LOTTERY is Wednesday\r\n  the 18th of this month, when 6 prizes of 30,000l. and all the other\r\n  capitals in the scheme will be determined. Every ticket will receive\r\n  5l. independent of any sum to which it may be entitled. In the last\r\n  Lottery containing 30,000l. prizes Swift and Co. sold two out of four\r\n  of them at their offices 11, Poultry; 1, Strand; and 31, Aldgate\r\n  High-street.\r\n\r\nIt is almost evident that the Lottery was “played out” on its own\r\nmerits, and that the interference of Parliament only hastened the end so\r\nfar as concerns the important events. Another firm of contractors put\r\nforth a final appeal thus:--\r\n\r\n  THE LAST of ALL, TO-MORROW, 18th October.--J. and J. SIVEWRIGHT,\r\n  Contractors, most positively assure the Public that--\r\n\r\n  To-morrow, Six of 30,000l. must be drawn.\r\n\r\n  To-morrow, 389,000l. will be decided.\r\n\r\n  To-morrow, all Lotteries end in this kingdom.\r\n\r\n  To gain a Prize of 30,000l. you must buy THIS DAY.\r\n\r\n  Tickets and Shares are selling by J. and J. SIVEWRIGHT, Contractors,\r\n  37, Cornhill; 11, Holborn; and 38, Haymarket; who shared and sold\r\n  12,478, a prize of 30,000l.; 3,613, 21,055l.; and in the last Lottery,\r\n  1,783, a prize of 21,000l.; and 3,925, a prize of 21,000l.\r\n\r\nOn the fatal day itself the only noticeable advertisement in the _Times_\r\nis that of Bish, which is the same as had been running for some little\r\ntime, and which on the 18th of October 1826, with the word “this day,”\r\ninstead of what had appeared before, stood thus, a specimen of the last\r\nnewspaper appeal in regard to a forthcoming State lottery:--\r\n\r\n  THE inevitable and absolute FINISH of LOTTERIES, THIS DAY.--BISH, in\r\n  soliciting for the last time the favours of his best friends, the\r\n  Public, assures them that,\r\n\r\n  This Day, a Ticket must gain            £30,000\r\n  This Day, a Half must gain               15,000\r\n  This Day a Quarter must gain              7,500\r\n  This Day an Eighth must gain              3,750\r\n  This Day a Sixteenth must gain            1,875\r\n  This Day, all the Six of £30,000 will be drawn,\r\n    every number decided, and every ticket a\r\n    Prize.\r\n  This Day, 18th instant, all lotteries end for ever.\r\n\r\n  Tickets and Shares are selling by BISH, Stockbroker, 4, Cornhill, and\r\n  9, Charing-cross, who shared and sold, within the last 12 months, 5\r\n  prizes of 30,000l. and 9 of 20,000l., and in the very last drawing, 3d\r\n  of May, No. 1,833 (Class B), 21,000l., and 3,925 (Class A), 21,000l.\r\n\r\nThe following is the record of the last drawing, as published in the\r\nThursday’s papers: “Yesterday afternoon, about half-past six o’clock,\r\nthat old servant of the State, the lottery, breathed its last, having\r\nfor a long period of years, ever since the days of Queen Anne,\r\ncontributed largely towards the public revenue of the country. This\r\nevent took place at Cooper’s Hall, Basinghall Street; and such was the\r\nanxiety on the part of the public to witness the last drawing of the\r\nlottery, that great numbers of persons were attracted to the spot,\r\nindependently of those who had an interest in the proceedings. The\r\ngallery of Cooper’s Hall was crowded to excess long before the period\r\nfixed for the drawing (five o’clock), and the utmost anxiety was felt by\r\nthose who had shares in the lottery for the arrival of the appointed\r\nhour. The annihilation of lotteries, it will be recollected, was\r\ndetermined on in the session of Parliament before last; and thus a\r\nsource of revenue, bringing into the treasury the sums of £250,000 and\r\n£300,000 per annum will be dried up. This determination on the part of\r\nthe Legislature is hailed by far the greatest portion of the public with\r\njoy, as it will put an end to a system which many believe to have\r\nfostered and encouraged the late speculations, the effects of which have\r\nbeen and are still severely felt. A deficiency in the public revenue to\r\nthe extent of £250,000 annually will, however, be the consequence of the\r\nannihilation of lotteries, and it must remain for those who have\r\nstrenuously supported the putting a stop to lotteries to provide for the\r\ndeficiency.”--“Although that which ended yesterday was the last, if we\r\nare informed correctly the lottery-office keepers have been left with a\r\ngreat number of tickets remaining on their hands--a pretty strong proof\r\nthat the public in general have now no relish for these schemes.”--“The\r\nconcourse of persons in Basinghall Street was very great; indeed, the\r\nstreet was almost impassable, and everybody seemed desirous of\r\nascertaining the fortunate numbers. In the gallery the greatest interest\r\nwas excited, as the various prizes were drawn from the wheel; and as\r\nsoon as a numbered ticket was drawn from the number wheel, every one\r\nlooked with anxiety to his share, in order to ascertain if Fortune\r\nsmiled on him. Only one instance occurred where a prize was drawn and a\r\nnumber held by any individual present. The fortunate person was a little\r\nman, who no sooner had learned that his number was a grand prize, than\r\nhe buttoned up his coat, and coolly walked off without uttering a word.\r\nAs the drawing proceeded disappointment began to succeed the hopes\r\nindulged by those who were present. On their entrance to the hall every\r\nface wore a cheerful appearance; but on the termination of the drawing a\r\nstrong contrast was exhibited, and the features of each were strongly\r\nmarked with dissatisfaction. The drawing commenced shortly after five\r\no’clock, and ended at twenty minutes past six. The doors of the various\r\nlottery offices were also surrounded by persons awaiting the issue of\r\nthe drawing.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAST OF THE LOTTERIES.]\r\n\r\nThe _Times_, in a short leader--short and few were the leaders in the\r\n_Times_ of that day--published on the Thursday, says: “Yesterday\r\nterminated the lotteries in this country--may we say for ever? We know\r\nnot. Such a result will depend upon the wants of Government, and the\r\nmorality of its ministers. However, we rejoice at their suspension,--a\r\nsuspension which we hope we have in some degree assisted in\r\neffecting,--yet rejoice with fear. Looking at the Stock Exchange, at the\r\ntime bargains, and at all the iniquities practised there, we have only\r\nto hope that the place of the lotteries may not be supplied by some more\r\nmischievous system of knavery. Time was when all the robberies were\r\ncommitted on the king’s highway. The lighting, watching, and general\r\nimprovement of our roads, have nearly put an end to this practice; but\r\nhousebreaking has unfortunately taken its place! And yet the people of\r\nEngland is not a gambling people like the French, as is evident from the\r\nfate of the last lottery. We have heard that hardly half the tickets\r\nwere sold; from which it is evident, that the spirit of lottery-gambling\r\nwas extinct before the system; and if that spirit had not been kept\r\nalive by incessant stimuli, it would have expired long ago.”\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to mention, though it is generally known, that an Act\r\nof the 9th and 10th Vict. was passed for legalising Art Union Lotteries\r\nwithin certain limits and under certain conditions. Though our chapter\r\nhas run over its length, we can hardly conclude without quoting the wise\r\nwords of Adam Smith on the subject of lotteries. “The chance of gain,”\r\nsays he, “is by every man more or less overvalued, and the chance of\r\nloss is by most men undervalued.... The world neither ever saw, or ever\r\nwill see, a perfectly fair lottery, or one in which the whole gain\r\ncompensated the whole loss; because the undertaker could make nothing by\r\nit. In the State lotteries the tickets are really not worth the price\r\nwhich is paid by the original subscribers, and yet commonly sell in the\r\nmarket for twenty, thirty, and sometimes forty per cent. advance. The\r\nvain hope of gaining some of the greatest prizes is the sole cause of\r\nthis demand. The soberest people scarce look upon it as a folly to pay a\r\nsmall sum for the chance of gaining ten or twenty thousand pounds;\r\nthough they know that even that small sum is perhaps twenty or thirty\r\nper cent. more than the chance is worth. In a lottery in which no prize\r\nexceeds twenty pounds, though in other respects it approach much nearer\r\nto a perfectly fair one than the common State lotteries, there would not\r\nbe the same demand for tickets. In order to have a better chance for\r\nsome of the great prizes, some people purchase several tickets, and\r\nothers small shares in a still greater number. There is not, however, a\r\nmore certain proposition in mathematics, than that the more tickets you\r\nadventure upon the more likely you are to be a loser. Adventure upon all\r\nthe tickets in the lottery, and you lose for certain; and the greater\r\nthe number of your tickets the nearer you approach to this certainty.”\r\nThough this was written in reference to a state of affairs long past,\r\nthe lesson is not without value nowadays.\r\n\r\nOctober 18, 1826, saw the last of the State lotteries, but it was long\r\nbefore the smaller fry were eradicated. Conducted very quietly at first,\r\nbut after a while their promoters growing bolder, lotteries for clothes,\r\nfurniture, and, especially at Christmas-time, for food and drink, were\r\nopenly advertised under the title of “sweeps” up to comparatively recent\r\ntimes. A few police prosecutions about a dozen years back improved these\r\nrelics of a past day off the face of the earth. There were, however,\r\nstill left what were called “specs,” which violated both the\r\nBetting-House Act and the Lottery Act, and the promoters of the chief of\r\nthem in turn suffered under the majesty of the law about the period of\r\nthe raid on the commission agents referred to in a previous chapter.\r\nUnder the guises of picture and circular sales these turf lotteries are\r\nstill continued, an advertisement in a sporting paper of June 1874\r\ngiving an address in Glasgow, informing all those whom it most concerns\r\nthat the “East End Circular” has for disposal\r\n\r\n  30,000 circulars, at 1_s._ each; the profits, about £800, will be\r\n  distributed on\r\n\r\n  THE DERBY.\r\n\r\n  2000 PRIZES. FIRST, £300.\r\n\r\n  This circular needs no recommendation. It is a fortune to all who\r\n  invest in it. The winners of all the large races have been sent in it.\r\n  Every purchaser has a fair chance of securing the £200. For circulars,\r\n  1_s._ each, apply at once to E. Jones, 128, Renfield Street, Glasgow,\r\n  or in person to any of his well-known agents.\r\n\r\nThen follows a list of names of people living in various parts of the\r\nkingdom who are empowered to sell the circulars. Within the past\r\ntwelvemonth certain small papers which added to their circulation by the\r\npresentation of coupons entitling the holders to shares in lotteries for\r\nprizes of all descriptions, received solemn warning from the Home\r\nOffice, and had to discontinue their projects. That this was wise,\r\nconsidering the innocence of the arrangement, we do not think; that it\r\nwas not impartial, the notice from which we have just quoted proves. For\r\nthe Lottery Act extends to Scotland, even if the Betting Act does\r\nnot.[45]\r\n\r\n  [40] Stow.\r\n\r\n  [41] Stow’s Annals.\r\n\r\n  [42] Baker’s Chronicle.\r\n\r\n  [43] Whereas, some give out that they could never receive their Books\r\n  after they were drawn in the first Lottery, the Author declares, and\r\n  it will be attested, that of seven hundred Prizes that were drawn\r\n  there were not six remaining Prizes that suffered with his in the\r\n  Fire; for the Drawing being on the 10th of May, 1665, the Office did\r\n  then continue open for the Delivery of the same (though the Contagion\r\n  much raged) until the latter End of July following; and opened again,\r\n  to attend the Delivery, in April, 1666, whither Persons repaired daily\r\n  for their Prizes, and continued open until the Fire.\r\n\r\n  [44] _Examiner_, October 22, 1826.\r\n\r\n  [45] Since the above was written the Betting-House Extension Act of\r\n  1874 has become law, and, curiously enough, has caused the cessation\r\n  of a procedure which was rendered illegal by an Act passed nearly\r\n  fifty years before, a fact which our detectives with proverbial\r\n  dulness were unable to discover. This was perhaps because there was\r\n  nothing to be got by the discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n_MATRIMONIAL ADVERTISEMENTS AND AGENCIES._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will not be at all out of the way to assume that as long as the world\r\nhas been populated it has possessed people anxious to get married.\r\nMarriage is the correct condition of life; indeed we have the best\r\nauthority for regarding it as one of the principal reasons of our being,\r\nand so there is no need for wonder that many of the best-known customs\r\nof the ancients bear upon marital rites and festivities. Marriage comes\r\nin due course to the majority, male and female; but there are,\r\nnaturally, those who have no desire for it, and again those who have to\r\nmake effort to obtain it. There are various ways of exhibiting one’s\r\nwares and attractions, and chief among them comes the object of our\r\nattention--advertising. Of late years there seems, in addition to the\r\nordinary courses open to advertisers, to have been special arrangements\r\nmade on behalf of the unmatched, who are allowed to express their\r\ndesires and recommendations free, gratis, for nothing, in the columns of\r\ncertain cheap periodicals--the described being all beauty or virtue, or\r\nboth, when not possessed of capital. Would-be lovers are not generally\r\ndeficient in either particular when the circulating medium is thrown\r\ninto the balance as well. So that by means of the weekly publications\r\nreferred to, marriage seems a much better commercial arrangement than\r\nthat mentioned by a modern author, who, speaking of the Babylonians,\r\nsays that “Herodotus records one of their customs, which, whether in\r\njest or earnest, he declares to be the wisest he ever heard of. This\r\nwas their wife-auction, by which they managed to find husbands for all\r\ntheir young women. The greatest beauty was put up first, and knocked\r\ndown to the highest bidder; then the next in the order of\r\ncomeliness--and so on to the damsel who was equidistant between beauty\r\nand plainness, who was given away gratis. Then the least plain was put\r\nup, and knocked down to the gallant who would marry her for the smallest\r\nconsideration,--and so on till even the plainest was got rid of to some\r\ncynical worthy who decidedly preferred lucre to looks. By transferring\r\nto the scale of the ill-favoured the prices paid for the fair, beauty\r\nwas made to endow ugliness, and the rich man’s taste was the poor man’s\r\ngain.”\r\n\r\nBut in the representations of the wistful lovers who confide their\r\nsecrets to certain editors, ugliness has no existence among the ladies,\r\nvice or laziness is unknown to the gentlemen, and money seems plentiful\r\nwith both, so that it remains quite a mystery how any of the intending\r\nsuitors have managed to evade Hymen for any length of time, so superior\r\nare they to the commonplace people whom we are in the habit of seeing\r\nsettled down in sober domesticity. A writer in a miscellany a few years\r\nback catalogued a lot of the claimants for matrimony, first in the list\r\nbeing Sincere Polly, who describes herself as dark, high-spirited, and\r\nhandsome; next is Evangelina, eighteen, handsome and accomplished, who\r\nwill have £300 a year when of age; Fanny declares herself to be a\r\nsweet-tempered and pretty girl, just seventeen; Annie Everard endeavours\r\nto attract by her modesty in saying that she is eighteen, and not\r\nbeautiful, only pretty; and Viola offers inducement in describing\r\nherself as seventeen, and Irish, merry, lively, and inclined to be\r\nstout. These ask for the carte-de-visite of a Captain Compass who\r\nadvertised previously. Following these young and lovely females comes\r\nBlanche, who describes herself as a slight, graceful girl of eighteen,\r\nwith dreamy violet eyes and golden rippling hair, shading a face of\r\nrare and delicate loveliness. She is a great admirer of soldiers, a\r\nlover of the chase, and all field sports. This enchanting creature is\r\nvery anxious for Albert’s carte-de-visite. Who is Albert, and what has\r\nhe done, that he of all men should be singled out to carry off this\r\nflower of creation? “But,” says the writer to whom we have referred, who\r\nseems quite unable to swallow the description, in which he is very\r\ndifferent from ourselves, as we would never contradict a lady, “the\r\nmorbid curiosity of the human mind goes a step farther, and seeks to\r\npicture Blanche--not the Blanche of Blanche’s vivid imagination, but\r\nBlanche herself. Two alternatives present themselves. She may be a stout\r\nlittle milliner in a Camden-town shop; or--_horribile dictu!_--a waggish\r\ncook, with a turned-up nose, underdone arms and cheeks to match. The\r\nideal Blanche fades away as we contemplate these possibilities. We pity\r\nAlbert. We hope he will not waste his hardly-earned money in the\r\nvanities of photography, and cordially wish him a comfortable married\r\nstate with a more earthly maiden, now that this too celestial vision\r\ndies back into dream-land. There is but one young person who approaches\r\nthe ideal Blanche; and she calls herself ‘Sparkling with Gems.’ She is\r\n(on her own authority, be it always understood) a young, pretty, and\r\naccomplished Irish girl, with blue eyes, pearly teeth, and a wealth of\r\ngolden ringlets, who is considered very stylish and graceful-looking, is\r\nof a loving disposition, and will have an income in her own right, and\r\nshe wishes for the carte-de-visite of a young gentleman, who must be\r\ntall, dark, and handsome, of good family and position, and either of the\r\nmilitary or medical profession. ‘Kill or cure’ is this young lady’s\r\nprinciple in choosing a husband; but we should say that so attractive a\r\nbride, with a wealth of golden ringlets, an income in her own right, and\r\nwhat not, ought certainly to fall into the hands (or arms) of a dashing\r\nyoung officer, whose want of an income in his own right is generally the\r\nchief drawback from the amenities of his profession.” Constance is\r\nalready possessed of £500 a year, and limits her hopes to a husband with\r\n£200 of income. But he must be fair, of the middle height, and\r\nnice-looking. Eunice has no money at all; but she has very dark hair and\r\neyes, rosy complexion, and is domestic. Here again our cynic shows his\r\nscepticism: “Had the indefinite article been placed before the last word\r\nin her catalogue of qualities, the description would probably have been\r\ncomplete.” Poor Jane says: “Why should I become a nun against my wish,\r\nmerely because my father wishes it? I suppose he wishes to get married\r\nagain, and I am in his way. I can say without flattery that I am near\r\ntwenty, have a very graceful figure, very handsome, and between the\r\nmedium height, a first-class pianist, and capable of making any\r\ngentleman a good wife. I possess no money. I am a lady, very domestic,\r\nand am quite certain that I am worthy of a good husband.” Poor Jane! her\r\nnotions of the descriptive are rather vague, and so are her ideas of\r\nwhat is a lady. But as we once knew a writer of stories for the\r\nperiodical in which her description appears who considered it beneath\r\nthe dignity of a gentleman to spell properly, Jane is, perhaps, quite\r\nright in her estimate of herself according to the code under which she\r\nwas instructed.\r\n\r\nSome of the gentlemen in this same catalogue deserve attention. As a\r\nrule, they seem to consider “proputty” the best qualification, though if\r\nother advantages are thrown in they will not be objected to. Let us pick\r\nout from the herd Gauntlet, who says that he is a gentleman of good\r\nstanding in society, a widower, forty, but looks much younger, of middle\r\nheight, highly respected in his own neighbourhood, and is possessed of\r\nupwards of £8000 at command; he wishes to meet with a lady younger than\r\nhimself, and with means equal to his own. Then there is R. S., who has\r\n£100 a year, is of like opinion as to the proportion of money his bride\r\nought to bring, and would like to become acquainted with a young lady of\r\nsimilar income, or one who has a talent for elocution or singing. Our\r\nauthor, after exhausting his list, admits that the young gentlemen who\r\nadvertise in the penny journals are far less mercenary than the young\r\nladies. “The latter betray quite a rapacity with regard to a good\r\nincome, are very explicit about it, and put down in plain figures the\r\nprecise sum which they think their charms are worth. By what means the\r\nacquaintanceship begun in these advertising columns is continued and\r\ncompleted we are unable to say. As a preliminary the editor kindly\r\nundertakes the charge of photographs; but of the steps by which the\r\ncontracting parties advance to the goal of their wishes we know nothing.\r\nWe should think that the proprietors of the journal ought to keep an\r\nattorney on the premises, to see that the gentlemen who offer £8000 are\r\nacting in good faith.” Had further inspection been given to the page in\r\nwhich these requisitions appear, the critic would have learned that,\r\nwhen second steps are taken, communication is made through a newspaper\r\nbelonging to the same proprietary as the penny journal, and would have\r\nseen that “all advertisements must be prepaid.” But we are beginning at\r\nthe wrong end, and must retrace our steps for the purpose of renewing\r\nacquaintance with our old friend Houghton, the father of English\r\nadvertising, who, in his _Collection_ of July 19, 1695, says:--\r\n\r\n  ⁂ I have undertaken to advertize all sorts of Things that are\r\n  honourable, and what follows is not otherwise, and I am well paid for\r\n  it:\r\n\r\n  ☞ A ^Gentleman^ about 30 Years of Age, that says he has a ^Very Good\r\n  Estate^, would willingly ^Match^ Himself to some ^Young Gentlewoman^\r\n  that has a Fortune of £3000 or thereabout, And he will make Settlement\r\n  to content.\r\n\r\n  When it shall appear that I am candid and no otherwise concerned than\r\n  in bringing two Elderly Persons to a Treaty; and the nine Days Wonder\r\n  and Laughter (usually attending new Things) are over, and that Nobody\r\n  shall know Anything of the Matter, but where I shall reasonably\r\n  believe they are in good earnest; then ’tis probable such\r\n  Advertisements may prove very useful.\r\n\r\n  A ^Young Man^ about 25 Years of Age, in a very good Trade, and whose\r\n  Father will make him worth £1000, would willingly embrace a suitable\r\n  ^Match^. He has been brought up a Dissenter with his Parents, and is a\r\n  sober Man.\r\n\r\nIt seems the public either did not believe in the reality of these\r\nadvertisements, or were suspicious of the advertisers, for a few weeks\r\nafter the editor thought necessary to declare again:--\r\n\r\n  ⁂ _These Proposals for Matches are real, and I do promise to manage\r\n  them and such like with so much Secresie and Prudence that none shall\r\n  discourse with their best Friends, with more Confidence of Fidelity\r\n  than with me, let them be of what Rank soever._\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these honest statements, Houghton appears to have been\r\nsadly teased on account of this innovation, for shortly after the above\r\nhe once more attempted an explanation:--\r\n\r\n  I thought what I said before about Matches, was very intelligible, but\r\n  I find otherwise: The Case is thus:\r\n\r\n  A. comes to me and says: his Friend has a Kinsman that he would be\r\n  glad to have match’d, and he is a sober, well-bred, comely,\r\n  understanding Man, and in so good an Employment, that with his Fortune\r\n  he shall deserve a vertuous, well-bred, discreet, comely Wife with a\r\n  Fortune of £1000, but his Kinsman has not much Acquaintance and is\r\n  bashful. This I publish and then comes B. and says his Friend has a\r\n  Kinswoman qualified as above, and he would gladly match her to such if\r\n  it be real. Upon this I bring the two that speak to me, together, and\r\n  if they can understand each other they carry on the Match: and if it\r\n  succeed, I shall expect some small Consideration, and this is what I\r\n  intend to be concerned in the Matter.\r\n\r\nThis explanation seems to have been thought satisfactory, and no doubt\r\neligible parties left their names and addresses with him, for a few\r\nweeks after the _Collection for Improvement of Husbandry and Trade_\r\ncontained the following:--\r\n\r\n  I know of several Men and Women whose Friends would gladly have them\r\n  match’d, which I’ll endeavour to do, as from Time to Time I shall hear\r\n  of such whose Circumstances are likely to agree; and I’ll assure such\r\n  as will come to me it shall be done with all the Honour and Secrecy\r\n  imaginable. Their own Parents shall not manage it more to their\r\n  Satisfaction, and the more comes to me the better I shall be able to\r\n  serve them.\r\n\r\nWe have already, in an early portion of this book, dilated on the claims\r\nHoughton has on the gratitude of past and present advertisers, and so we\r\nwill pass on to the next specimen on our list, which appears in the\r\n_Gazetteer_ of December 14, 1771:--\r\n\r\n  TO GENTLEMEN OF FORTUNE.\r\n\r\n  A MOST advantageous Opportunity now offers to any young Gentleman of\r\n  Character and independent Fortune; the Advertiser of this will\r\n  introduce such to a most accomplished young Lady of Fortune, and\r\n  greater Expectancy. None but a real Gentleman will succeed: therefore\r\n  it is desired no other would apply. Letters directed to P. L. at the\r\n  Nottingham Coffee-house, opposite Great Turnstile, Holborn, mentioning\r\n  their present Condition, and where to inquire of the specified\r\n  Particulars, signed with their own Name, will have due Regard and\r\n  Honour, and Secrecy observed as it is required.\r\n\r\nFrom this and kindred notices in the papers of a hundred years ago or\r\nso, it would appear that certain young ladies were kept, like the fabled\r\ndamsels of old, each in an enchanted castle, until some knight should\r\nappear to break the spell. With just this difference, that not chivalry\r\nbut cheque-books was the requisition, and that the dragon, instead of\r\nbeing punished by the avenging sword, was rewarded with the “usual\r\npercentage.” In 1775 the following handbill must have been pretty\r\nfamiliar to residents in London:--\r\n\r\n  _No. 2, Dover Street, St. James’s._\r\n\r\n  MARRIAGE TREATIES\r\n\r\n  Carried on, and solely calculated for such Persons as can give the\r\n  best Proof of being (totally) at their own Disposal.\r\n\r\n  THE open undisguised Manner in which this truly important Business is\r\n  pursued, will best appear by the following Plan, which is humbly\r\n  submitted to the Judgment of the Public. Negociation of Money is also\r\n  transacted at the House, where widow Ladies, Clergy, and other\r\n  Gentlemen, may possibly be accommodated with Sums on granting\r\n  Annuities, or otherwise, as may be agreed upon.\r\n\r\n  The great Utility of this Undertaking, especially that Department of\r\n  it relative to Marriage, is so very striking, that it seems to bespeak\r\n  the Approbation of this great Metropolis, where _Business_ may almost\r\n  be said to have rivall’d _Marriage_; for it not only robs the\r\n  Gentlemen of their Time, but the Ladies of their Lovers. Now this\r\n  House in Dover Street is established to supply the Time that is\r\n  wanting; and Courtships may be carried on by Way of Proxy to their\r\n  final Issue: thus will the Gentleman save his Time, and the Lady gain\r\n  a Husband; and it will be readily allowed that happy Marriages are the\r\n  very Cement of Society, the Promoters of Virtue, and may be truly said\r\n  to strike at the very Root of Dissipation.\r\n\r\n  Upon these honourable, these eligible Principles, it is that the\r\n  Managers of this Undertaking ground all their Hopes; nor have they\r\n  ventured to announce it to the Public without the maturest\r\n  Deliberation, after having considered it in every Point of View; and\r\n  dare assure the World, that the most upright Conduct, greatest\r\n  Delicacy and inviolable Secrecy shall be observed in all their\r\n  Proceedings; and as this Plan bids fair for the Happiness of\r\n  Thousands, so will it soon put a Stop to those futile, trifling (not\r\n  to say dangerous) Advertisements that so frequently invade the public\r\n  Ear, and which seem but too often calculated to deceive.\r\n\r\n  As to the Proprietors themselves, some of them are well known in the\r\n  City, and others are not totally Strangers in the polite Circle; which\r\n  puts it still more in their Power to promote the Design, and that not\r\n  more upon the Principles of Love and Honour, than those of Sense and\r\n  Discretion.\r\n\r\n  Each Person who appears at Dover Street (aforesaid) will be shown into\r\n  a separate Apartment. Such as cannot attend in Person, are requested\r\n  to signify their Intention by their Friend in Writing; and it is hoped\r\n  and presumed that such Recital will be made with the utmost Exactness;\r\n  and not only the Situation in Life, but the Age, Constitution, and\r\n  Religion of the Party set forth with all possible Accuracy and\r\n  Candour.\r\n\r\n  It hardly seems needful to add, that so much Time and Thought cannot\r\n  be supposed to have been laid out without a reasonable Recompense;\r\n  therefore it will be quite necessary, when the Principals do not\r\n  appear (which may not unfrequently happen), that their Agents shall\r\n  have been apprised that the Terms upon which this truly important\r\n  Matter is commenced, is no more than FIVE GUINEAS, to be paid to the\r\n  Managers on taking down the Minutes of the Business; and no more is to\r\n  be paid till after the Matter is completed, either by supplying the\r\n  Sum of Money according to Agreement, or by the Marriage of the Parties\r\n  in Question: and although the Managers claim no more than FIVE\r\n  GUINEAS, yet (it is presumed) so small a Sum will not be deemed an\r\n  adequate Compensation, when Business of Consequence is to be done, and\r\n  Persons of Condition and liberal Sentiment concerned.\r\n\r\n  The Proprietors are to be spoken with from eleven in the Morning till\r\n  four in the Afternoon, and from seven in the Evening till ten at Night\r\n  (as many cannot attend before that Time) every Day, Sunday excepted;\r\n  and as it is manifest that many Gentlemen both in Court and City, are\r\n  so absorbed in Business, that though they are happy in the Thought of\r\n  Marriage, and every Way qualified to engage in it, yet may have\r\n  neither Time nor Temper for the tedious Forms of Courtship; and as it\r\n  is also manifest that many excellent Women are, in a great Measure,\r\n  lost to Society, lost (as we may say) to the tender Joys of Hymen; and\r\n  who, tied down by Custom to be passive, cannot be first Movers in a\r\n  Point so delicate; to shun, therefore, all unnecessary Forms (for true\r\n  Sincerity, we know, cannot exist with too much Ceremony), it is hoped\r\n  that the above Expedient will be adopted, and that each Person, in\r\n  Town or Country, who employs an Agent, will signify their Intention so\r\n  clearly, and candidly, that the Managers may have it in their Power to\r\n  compleat the Business, and that as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n  And although it is said above that the Ladies cannot be first Movers\r\n  in some certain Points, yet, sure, they are not debarred the use of\r\n  Agents; nor does true Modesty demand the Sacrifice of Sense.\r\n\r\n  _Note_, Sums of Money, from Five Hundred Pounds to any Amount\r\n  whatsoever, may be had, and that upon the shortest Notice, and most\r\n  equitable Terms. Every Proposal that is practicable will be compleated\r\n  without Trifling or Delay.\r\n\r\n  It would be superfluous to trouble the Public about the Characters of\r\n  the Proprietors of this House for Honour and Delicacy, as it could not\r\n  possibly subsist without such a Foundation; therefore the Nobility,\r\n  Gentry, and other Persons may depend on being accommodated with any\r\n  Sum, as above, without Loss of Time.\r\n\r\n  Persons who have Monies to lend, as well as those who have Occasion to\r\n  borrow, may both be accommodated at Dover Street aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThese handbills being largely circulated, and advertisements being\r\ninserted in the principal newspapers at the same time, the establishment\r\nenjoyed its full share of notice. At a masked ball given by Mrs\r\nCornelys,[46] on the 16th of July 1776, one of the characters was a\r\nJew, with a label in his hat inscribed with the words “Marriage\r\nTreaties,” who delivered to the company the following card:--\r\n\r\n  THE MARRIAGE BROKER\r\n\r\n  Accommodates Ladies and Gentlemen with everything in the matrimonial\r\n  way which their Hearts can wish for (Virtue and Money only excepted),\r\n  and that at first sight of the Parties, having fitted up a variety of\r\n  very commodious Apartments.--He deals either in the ton or City Stile.\r\n  If a difficult case, apply to our Attorney General, who attends me\r\n  here in Person. N.B. I only charge five Guineas poundage per couple.\r\n\r\n  MARRIAGE TREATIES.\r\n\r\n    Ye Nymphs forlorn, who pine away in Shades!\r\n    Ye mournful Widows, wailing for--Brocades!\r\n    Coxcombs who sigh for--Mode! and sighing Wits!\r\n    Bucks of St. James’s! and ye Half-moon’d Cits!\r\n    Ye old and young--the ugly and the fair!\r\n    To Hymen’s Shrine haste, sacrifice despair.\r\n    Let Law divorce, tyrannic Husbands rail,\r\n    Hence dare their Ire!--for here’s enough for sale.\r\n    Let Virtue’s mask the Wife awhile pursue,\r\n    Here’s fresh Supply--here Wives of ev’ry Hue!\r\n    Black, white, red, grey--the bright, the dull, the witty!\r\n    Here’s Dames for Courtiers, misses for the City!\r\n\r\nIn the August number of the _Town and Country Magazine_, 1776, a\r\ncorrespondent who signs himself “Lothario,” wrote a letter to warn the\r\npublic against the Dover Street Marriage Office. It states that, having\r\npaid his five guineas, he had his name entered on the list of candidates\r\nfor matrimony, and that in due course of time he received a letter,\r\nintimating that a lady, conforming minutely to the conditions for which\r\nhe had stipulated, wanted a husband exactly like himself. The lady,\r\nafter some formalities, gave him an appointment in Gray’s Inn Gardens,\r\ndescribing her dress; and in order that she might not be mistaken in the\r\ngentleman (for till then the parties had not seen each other), she\r\ndesired that he should have a large nosegay in his hand, bound round\r\nwith a blue ribbon, which he was to present to her as an introduction to\r\ntheir conference. Unfortunately the lady turned out to be an old\r\nacquaintance of the gay Lothario, and by no means the sort of person he\r\ncould have desired for a wife. This exposition of the matrimonial\r\nswindle was answered by the company, with the following advertisement in\r\nthe _Morning Post_, October 17, 1776:--\r\n\r\n  TO THE CANDID AND IMPARTIAL.\r\n\r\n  ON perusing the Town and Country Magazine of August last, Page 408,\r\n  there appears a Letter in which the Author throws out a very\r\n  illiberal, unjust Assertion, viz., that any new Plan or Scheme that is\r\n  offered to the Public is founded upon Imposition; and then goes on to\r\n  recite an elaborate Tale of his having paid five Guineas to the\r\n  Managers of the Marriage-Plan, and of his obtaining the promise of a\r\n  Wife with £10,000 on declaring himself worth treble that Sum. Now the\r\n  Managers of that Undertaking are called upon to assert, that they are\r\n  equally unacquainted with the Villa or with the Lady he mentions (not\r\n  but it would be their Pride and Boast for such as resolve to return\r\n  to the Paths of Virtue and Honour); and they further declare that\r\n  every Line of this Letter that reflects the least Dishonour on them,\r\n  and that does not set their Undertaking in the fairest Point of View,\r\n  is utterly groundless.\r\n\r\n  _Note_, The Managers of said Plan, in Dover Street, finding that the\r\n  Payment of five Guineas has been thought by some too much on the\r\n  Commencement, have resolved to reduce that Payment to the Sum of two\r\n  Guineas for the Future to each Gentleman who may apply; and to give\r\n  the World some Proof that the Managers are no Deceivers, they will\r\n  return, on Demand, the three Guineas overplus, to such who have paid\r\n  the five above mentioned.\r\n\r\n  Ladies of Reputation are invited gratis, and the Managers shall think\r\n  themselves highly honoured, as well as amply rewarded, by their\r\n  Appearance, which must add true Dignity to a Plan where their Felicity\r\n  is consulted, without trespassing on their Delicacy.\r\n\r\n  ⁂ Counsellor Taite, one of the Managers, will carefully answer all\r\n  Letters, or other Applications relative to Money Negotiations, and has\r\n  the Disposal of several large Sums for that Purpose.\r\n\r\nLike its predecessors and followers in quackery and cheating, the Dover\r\nStreet establishment died of itself in due course, and its promoters\r\ndoubtless turned their attention to new swindles. In the _Daily\r\nAdvertiser_ of 1777 the following is discovered, and is noticeable for\r\nthe horse-couping manner in which the young gentleman speaks of the\r\nfuture bride who is to assist him in setting up housekeeping. He must\r\nhave had some trouble in finding such a thoroughbred filly as he\r\nrequires:--\r\n\r\n  MATRIMONY.\r\n\r\n  WANTED, by a young Gentleman just beginning House-keeping, a Lady,\r\n  between eighteen and twenty-five Years of Age, with a good Education,\r\n  and a Fortune not less than 5,000_l._; sound Wind and Limb, Five Feet\r\n  Four Inches without her Shoes; not fat, nor yet too lean; a clear\r\n  Skin; sweet Breath, with good Set of Teeth; no Pride, nor Affectation;\r\n  not very talkative, nor one that is deemed no Scold; but of a Spirit\r\n  to resent an Affront; of a charitable Disposition; not over fond of\r\n  Dress, though always decent and clean; that will entertain her\r\n  Husband’s Friends with Affability and Cheerfulness, and prefer his\r\n  Company to public Diversions and gadding about; one who can keep his\r\n  Secrets, that he may open his Heart to her without reserve on all\r\n  Occasions; that can extend domestic Expenses with Economy, as\r\n  Prosperity advances, without Ostentation; and retrench them with\r\n  Cheerfulness, if Occasion should require.\r\n\r\n  Any Lady disposed to Matrimony, answering this Description, is desired\r\n  to direct for Y. Z. at the Baptist’s Head Coffee-House, Aldermanbury.\r\n\r\n  N.B. None but Principals will be treated with, nor need any apply that\r\n  are deficient in any one Particular: the Gentleman can make adequate\r\n  Return, and is, in every Respect, deserving a Lady with the above\r\n  Qualifications.\r\n\r\nGetting on towards the present day, we come across an advertisement in\r\nthe _Courier_ of May 1815 from a lady who, like the gentleman we have\r\njust attended to, wants a good deal for the money. Unlike him, however,\r\nshe is not young, and so should know better than to ask for a\r\ncombination of impossibilities in a husband, when, according to her own\r\nshowing, she should be glad to get a very ordinary creature indeed:--\r\n\r\n  MATRIMONY.--A Lady, tremblingly alive to the impropriety of this\r\n  address, is nevertheless compelled, from the family discomforts she\r\n  now endures, to adopt this method of obtaining a friend and protector;\r\n  and she is quite certain, that a candid explanation of her situation,\r\n  will excuse, with a liberal mind, this apparently indecorous appeal.\r\n  The Advertiser has been married, is middle-aged, of pleasing\r\n  appearance, highly educated, and accomplished; but, she flatters\r\n  herself, the regulations of her heart and mind exceed all outward\r\n  recommendation: her income is very small, and only just sufficient to\r\n  enable her to make the appearance of a gentlewoman. The being she is\r\n  desirous of looking up to for happiness, must be, by birth, far above\r\n  the middling class of society; and all professions, except the Church,\r\n  the Army, or Navy, will be objected to; about forty, but not under\r\n  that age; very tall, of gentlemanlike appearance, and possessing that\r\n  polish, and those habits, that are only to be acquired in good\r\n  company; of an unimpeached, moral, respectable, and honourable\r\n  character, fond of retirement and domestic life. Fortune not being the\r\n  object of the Advertiser, she requires his income only to be equal to\r\n  his own wants; and she will never lessen it. As the most serious and\r\n  painful causes have occasioned this Address, it is earnestly solicited\r\n  that no one will reply to it from curiosity or amusement; and persons\r\n  who seek fortune, connections, or any other worldly advantage, will\r\n  only be disappointed by noticing it; but should it meet the eye of a\r\n  being whose mind is sufficiently cultivated to consider a well-born,\r\n  elegant, and accomplished companion, and sincere friend, the first\r\n  treasure in life, from such she will be glad to hear; and real names\r\n  and addresses will be considered a pledge of sincerity that will not\r\n  be abused. Letters must be post paid, and addressed to O. P. Q.,\r\n  Two-penny Post-office, Blandford-street, Portman-square.\r\n\r\nIn December 1818 there appeared in _Galignani_ an application from the\r\nscion of a distinguished though unfortunate family who was anxious to\r\nenter into the holy state. It was called\r\n\r\n  OFFER OF MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n  COUNT SARSFIELD, Lord Lucan, descendant of the royal branches of\r\n  Lorraine and Capet, and other sovereigns of Europe, wishes to contract\r\n  an alliance with a lady capable from her rank and talents of\r\n  supporting the dignity and titles, which an alliance so honourable\r\n  would confer on her. Address, Poste Restante à Paris.\r\n\r\nThe name of Sarsfield is highly distinguished in the military annals of\r\nIreland: during the eventful period subsequent to the expulsion of James\r\nII. from England, Sarsfield was General-in-Chief of the Irish troops,\r\nand was one of those who took advantage of the capitulation of Limerick\r\nto transfer himself and family to another country. But for all his great\r\nname and historical associations, this Sarsfield was but a poor\r\nadventurer; for he did not succeed in getting any rich parvenue to\r\nnibble at his bait, as is evidenced by this, which seven years\r\nafterwards appeared in a London newspaper:--\r\n\r\n  COUNT SARSFIELD LUCAN, lineal descendant of the royal line of Lorraine\r\n  and Capet, and other sovereigns of Europe, desires to join in an\r\n  alliance of marriage with a lady whose qualities and abilities will\r\n  enable her to support the rank and titles she will obtain by this\r\n  honourable alliance. Address to Count Sarsfield Lucan, Poste Restante\r\n  à Paris.\r\n\r\nIn a handbill circulated about the year 1820, a “new matrimonial plan”\r\nis ventilated. The advertiser states that he possesses “an establishment\r\nwhere persons of all classes who are anxious to sweeten life by\r\nrepairing to the _altar of Hymen_, have an opportunity of meeting with\r\nproper partners.... Their personal attendance is not absolutely\r\nnecessary, a statement of facts is all that is required at first.” The\r\nmethod propounded was for all anxious to secure husbands or wives to\r\nbecome subscribers to the institution, the amount of subscription to be\r\nregulated according to the class in which they place themselves, the\r\nclasses being described thus in the plan:--\r\n\r\n  _Ladies._\r\n\r\n  1st Class.  I am twenty years of age, heiress to an estate in the\r\n              county of Essex of the value of 30,000_l._, well educated,\r\n              and of domestic habits; of an agreeable, lively\r\n              disposition, and genteel figure.

I am tall and thin, a little lame in the hip, of a lively\r\n              disposition, conversible, twenty years of age, live with\r\n              my father, who, if I marry with his consent, will give me\r\n              1,000_l._\r\n\r\n  4th Class.  I am twenty years of age; mild disposition and manners;\r\n              allowed to be personable.\r\n\r\n  5th Class.  I am sixty years of age; income limited; active, and\r\n              rather agreeable.\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen._\r\n\r\n  1st Class.  A young gentleman with dark eyes and hair; stout made;\r\n              well educated; have an estate of 500_l._ per annum in the\r\n              county of Kent; besides 10,000_l._ in three per cent.\r\n              consolidated annuities; am of an affable disposition, and\r\n              very affectionate.\r\n\r\n  2nd Class.  I am forty years of age, tall and slender, fair complexion\r\n              and hair, well tempered and of sober habits, have a\r\n              situation in the Excise, of 300_l._ per annum, and a small\r\n              estate in Wales of the annual value of 150_l._\r\n\r\n  3rd Class.  A tradesman in the city of Bristol, in a ready-money\r\n              business, turning 150_l._ per week at a profit of 10 per\r\n              cent., pretty well tempered, lively, and fond of home.\r\n\r\n  4th Class.  I am fifty-eight years of age; a widower, without\r\n              encumbrance; retired from business upon a small income;\r\n              healthy constitution; and of domestic habits.\r\n\r\n  5th Class.  I am twenty-five years of age; a mechanic of sober habits;\r\n              industrious, and of respectable connections.\r\n\r\n  It is presumed that the public will not find any difficulty in\r\n  describing themselves; if they should, they will have the assistance\r\n  of the managers, who will be in attendance at the office, No. 5, Great\r\n  St. Helens, Bishopsgate Street, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,\r\n  between the hours of eleven and three o’clock.--Please to inquire for\r\n  Mr Jameson, up one pair of stairs. All letters to be post paid.\r\n\r\n  The subscribers are to be furnished with a list of descriptions, and\r\n  when one occurs likely to suit, the parties may correspond; and if\r\n  mutually approved, the interview may be afterwards arranged.\r\n\r\nAbout 1840, some adventurers anxious to emulate the success achieved by\r\nmatrimonial agencies in Paris and other towns on the Continent, set up\r\nan office in the neighbourhood of Cavendish Square, and issued a\r\nprospectus, which stated that it was written by a clergyman of the\r\nChurch of England, who was also a graduate of the University of\r\nOxford--a kind of double guarantee as to purity of morals and excellence\r\nof style--and which, after setting forth the advantages of such an\r\nestablishment properly conducted, and the success which had attended on\r\nsimilar ventures in other countries where people were less prejudiced,\r\nwent on thus:--\r\n\r\n  It is conducted by a gentleman and his wife, both persons of the\r\n  highest character, respectability, and connexions. They have separate\r\n  houses at some distance from each other, at which the husband gives\r\n  interviews to gentlemen and his wife to ladies. The negotiations are\r\n  conducted in conformity with printed rules, from which not the\r\n  slightest deviation will be allowed, and everything is managed in a\r\n  manner which cannot offend the most fastidious delicacy, or deter the\r\n  most easily excited diffidence. It is quite impossible that ladies or\r\n  gentlemen applying to the establishment can see each other, until a\r\n  meeting be finally and satisfactorily arranged, and all effects of\r\n  idle curiosity are effectually checked. The rules are to be published\r\n  for ten shillings--the price is set upon them for no other reason than\r\n  as some guard against the thoughtless, the idle or the ill\r\n  disposed--at Mr Proudfoot’s, 63, Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square,\r\n  and they entitle the purchaser to a speedy interview.\r\n\r\nIn the same year an advertisement was published in the papers directing\r\nthe ignorant in such matters where to apply in the event of their\r\nwishing to obtain the benefits of the agency and the services of the\r\nclergyman of the Church of England and graduate of the University of\r\nOxford:--\r\n\r\n  MATRIMONIAL ALLIANCE.--The Pamphlets, Rules, and Regulations of this\r\n  Establishment for promoting Matrimonial Alliances, may be obtained by\r\n  applying to A. B. care of Mr. Proudfoot, 63, Mortimer Street,\r\n  Cavendish Square. Price of the pamphlet one shilling. The Portfolio of\r\n  February is now ready, containing letters from gentlemen in every\r\n  sphere of life, possessing property from £400 to £3000 per annum, and\r\n  may be purchased or inspected by ladies, free of charge, at the\r\n  agent’s, 63, Mortimer Street, as above.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the honours of the clergyman and the contents of the\r\nportfolio, the old-fashioned and insulated notions of English folk were\r\ntoo much for the Alliance, which in due course faded from sight and\r\nrecollection. Possibly the graduate sought those happier climes to which\r\nhe refers in his exordium, and there made two into one as often as he\r\ncould wish. Ten years or more after Mr Proudfoot and his reverend friend\r\nhad departed from the scene, the following, which is suggestive of a\r\nstill smaller agency, appeared. It is a unique specimen of the use to\r\nwhich artful and designing folks can under any set professions put\r\nadvertisements:--\r\n\r\n  TO GIRLS OF FORTUNE.--MATRIMONY.--A bachelor, young, amiable,\r\n  handsome, of good family, and accustomed to move in the highest sphere\r\n  of society, is embarrassed in his circumstances. Marriage is his only\r\n  hope of extrication. This advertisement is inserted by one of his\r\n  friends. Ingratitude was never one of his faults, and he will study\r\n  for the remainder of his life to prove his estimation of the\r\n  confidence placed in him. Address, post paid L. L. H. L., 47 King\r\n  Street, Soho.--N.B. The witticisms of cockney scribblers deprecated.\r\n\r\nThis was evidently concocted by a man who knew what would be most likely\r\nto attract silly spinsters of a romantic turn of mind and independent\r\nmeans. Did he succeed? We cannot say, but sincerely hope not, as the\r\nprofessions are too good to be sincere, and his pretensions are pitched\r\ntoo high to be genuine. The following has been already compared with the\r\nhandsome bachelor’s effusion:--\r\n\r\n  MATRIMONIAL ADVERTISEMENT. I hereby give notice to all unmarried women\r\n  that I, John Hobnail, am at this writing five and forty, a widower,\r\n  and in want of a wife. As I wish no one to be mistaken, I have a good\r\n  cottage with a couple of acres of land, for which I pay 2_l._ a-year.\r\n  I have five children, four of them old enough to be in employment;\r\n  three sides of bacon and some pigs ready for market. I should like to\r\n  have a woman fit to take care of her house when I am out. I want no\r\n  second family. She may be between 40 and 50 if she likes. A good\r\n  sterling woman would be preferred, who would take care of the pigs.\r\n\r\nThis was originally given in _Blackwood_ over twenty years ago. John\r\nHobnail is plain-spoken, but he is evidently honest, and no greater\r\ncontrast could be afforded to L. L. H. L. than John’s desires for a\r\nmate. Here is no high-falutin’ nonsense, and romance-reading young\r\nladies were doubtlessly horrified at the use to which John would put a\r\n“good sterling woman.” But there may, after all, be heroism in\r\npig-feeding; and many a brave lady would quail before a hungry sow and\r\nher litter. Some might also object to the contiguity in which Mr Hobnail\r\nplaces his porkers and his children. Differing from John Hobnail very\r\nwidely, yet in the same agricultural interest, is the author of the next\r\napplication, which a good many years nearer the present time than the\r\n_Blackwood_ specimen, appeared in a Yorkshire journal. The effusion is\r\nin its way almost as curious as the two are which immediately precede\r\nit--at least we think so, whatever our readers may do:--\r\n\r\n  WANTED a WIFE, by a handsome young FARMER who is desirous of becoming\r\n  domesticated, and of enjoying the society of a young, good-tempered\r\n  female, who would tempt him away from his market festivities by her\r\n  pleasing and gently persuasive manners. She must not exceed 20, unless\r\n  she be a widow, whose family must not exceed six. Want of beauty would\r\n  be no kind of objection, provided she possessed from 1,000_l._ to\r\n  2,000_l._ His rent, tithes, and taxes are all paid up, and he is\r\n  wholly free from debt. All that he requires is love, peace, and\r\n  happiness. Apply ---- near Tenbury.\r\n\r\nAll he requires is love, peace, and happiness. Love of course includes\r\nbeauty; and so we can manage to understand that his object really is\r\nlove and beauty, or a thousand pounds, and two if possible. How he can\r\nexpect peace, to say nothing of happiness, when he gives a widow with\r\nsix children a chance, passes our comprehension. But some men will do\r\nanything for money, and we regret to say that this handsome young farmer\r\nappears, after all, to be of a most mercenary description. While we are\r\nso far north, we may as well turn to Sheffield, in which town, about\r\nfive years ago, a very amusing police case, having its origin in a\r\nmatrimonial advertisement, was heard. The complaint was laid against\r\nthree young men of the town of blades, named respectively George Herd,\r\nJoseph Fidler, and Arthur Harrop, who were charged by John Wilmer\r\nLambert, “for that they did unlawfully, maliciously, and knowingly, with\r\nintent to provoke a breach of the peace, cause to be inserted in a\r\ncertain public newspaper, called the _Sheffield Independent_, a certain\r\nfalse, scandalous, and defamatory statement of libel of and concerning\r\none John Wilmer Lambert, and against the peace of our Lady the Queen.”\r\nThe libel thus described was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  TO SINGLE YOUNG WOMEN.--A young man wishes to meet with a partner for\r\n  life. Any young lady feeling disposed, apply by letter, WILMER\r\n  LAMBERT, auger filer, St Mary’s-road, Sheffield.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the answers the unhappy Wilmer received from\r\nthe fair ones of Sheffield: “Aperil 5, 1869. Sir--seeing Advertisement\r\nIn the _Independent_ that you are in Wants a partner for _life_ so i\r\nhoffer myself as a Candate But Befoare there Is much More caresspondenc\r\nI should like an intearew with _you_. Notes the adress....” A more\r\ndignified lady says: “Wilmer Lambert: The under singed quite feel\r\ndisposed as _you call it_. I am considered by my friends good looking\r\nand they think I shall make a good wife. I am the age 22 and dark. If W.\r\nL. answers this pleas to send cart de visite. Address by letter.”\r\n\r\nThe next correspondent is anxious to make a match, if not to find a\r\nhusband for herself: “Sir,--I with pleasure saw it advertised in the\r\n_Independent_ to-day you was in wants of a partner and would be obliged\r\nif you will acpt Miss A. M. A----, tall, dark hair, dark eyes, and what\r\nthe world calls good looking (age 23), or my sister who is (24) good\r\nlooking. A widdow no children. A fortune at her own disposal willed to\r\nher by her late husband Mr. R----, or if you would Prefer a light young\r\nlady my friend Miss C. M. C----, who is at present residing in\r\nSheffield, but is scotch, light hair, blue eyes, and affectionate will\r\naccept you please to answer in Tuesday _Independent_ and you shall hear\r\nfearther from me.--Please not delay as I shall be ancouse to know which\r\nyou prefer.” This lady’s anxiety to rush in and try her hand at\r\nmatch-making will perhaps in some way account for the contemptuous tone\r\nof the “but is scotch,” though, continuing the description, we find that\r\neven the Scotch young lady has forgotten the caution peculiar to her\r\npeople, and so distasteful to her match-making friend, and has decided\r\nto accept the auger-filer.\r\n\r\nA fifth is also affectionate, but cautious: “My dear fren Iv Sean in to\r\nDay Nuse Paper you Wanting A wife I shall be glad for a good husborn But\r\nI should Be very Glad to now you age firs 2 I should like to now Wether\r\nyou are Good temper. My age is 24 years and a little Incom for Life and\r\nif you are Really in Wants of A Wife I should be happy to seay you after\r\nyou Have Sent you Liknes and then I will meat you at my sisters and then\r\nWe Will talk the Matter Over. Short aquantress Som times makes Long\r\nRepentnc. But, I Would Mak you Comfortable Wile I Liv and A Little After\r\nI am Dead Weakly Incom PS Excuse my Riting PS Anserr by Next Post.” This\r\nis indeed a gem which would have gladdened the heart of Isaac Pitman;\r\nand with a wife who will make her husband comfortable after death, we\r\nmust conclude our examples. There are other letters, one from “a\r\npublican’s daughter, twenty-three years of age, and as no objection to\r\nbe a Partner if bouth sides sues tgether;” and several which bear the\r\nappearance of having been written for the purpose of hoaxing. After some\r\nlittle time spent in hearing the case, the defendants agreed to\r\napologise and pay the costs, upon which Wilmer Lambert, auger-filer,\r\nfelt that his honour was appeased, and stated that he would withdraw\r\nfrom the prosecution.\r\n\r\nIn _Belgravia_, of six or seven years back, there is an article on\r\nmatrimonial advertisements and the answers to correspondents which are\r\npeculiar to certain of the penny periodicals. It enters so thoroughly\r\ninto the subject, and contains so much information as well as amusement,\r\nthat a selection from it will be found agreeable. Speaking of the\r\n“answers,” the writer says, after alluding to one or two of a different\r\nsort: “By far the greater number of correspondents are, however,\r\nconcerned about matrimonial affairs. The _London Journal_ is, perhaps,\r\nthe periodical which does the largest business of this kind. In a single\r\ncopy there are no fewer than twenty-three paragraphs relating to this\r\nsubject, many of them referring to four or five separate correspondents,\r\nbesides two long lists of announcements of cartes-de-visite wanted and\r\nreceived. The study of these paragraphs is curious and edifying. ‘P. Y.\r\nR.,’ who seems to be a favoured personage, has in some previous number\r\nasked for a wife. In reply he is told that ‘Nellie Vernon, twenty-two,\r\naccomplished, rather tall, dark, and considered handsome; an English\r\nGem, nineteen, pretty, lady-like, and the daughter of an independent\r\ngentleman; Emilie R., twenty, handsome, and of good family; and Eveline\r\nde Courcy, eighteen, fair and pretty, and will have a nice fortune--wish\r\nto correspond and receive the carte-de-visite of the favoured one.’ Next\r\ncomes the announcement of a forlorn swain. He tells the sympathetic\r\nreaders of his favourite ‘weekly’ that he ‘is twenty-three, tall, dark,\r\nand good-tempered, and has an income of £500 a year,’ and he asks to\r\ncorrespond with ‘a pretty and amiable young lady.’ One of the softer sex\r\ncomes next. ‘Emma G., a well-informed girl of nineteen, rather dark,\r\ngenteel, five feet eight inches in height, a domestic servant, is very\r\nmuch in want of some one to love.’ The domestic servant is, however,\r\neclipsed by the lady whose announcement of her wishes is to be found in\r\nthe same column. ‘Queen Adeline’ flies at higher game--evidently\r\ndesires, in a word, one of the earls or marquises who figure so\r\nmagnificently in the serial novels of the journal--and thus expresses\r\nher wishes: she is, she says, ‘tall, dark, handsome, and has £400 a\r\nyear,’ and she would like to have ‘the carte-de-visite of a tall, dark,\r\nand handsome man, not too old. She is twenty-two. He must have\r\nwell-formed and small hands and feet, and plenty of money.’ It is\r\ndifficult to imagine that these announcements and their like are\r\npublished in good faith. Of course, we can understand why ‘Emma G.’ or\r\n‘Sergeant D.,’ a non-commissioned officer of the line, should publish\r\ntheir wants in this very open way; but as for the ladies and gentlemen\r\nwith £400 and £500 a year, who appeal to the editor for partners for\r\nlife, _que diable viennent-ils faire dans cette galère?_ Is it possible\r\nthat there are people in the world who, unless they have some\r\nirremovable stain upon their characters, find any difficulty in\r\ndisposing of their incomes and themselves amongst their own friends?\r\n\r\n“This is probably a sufficiently business-like way of arranging a\r\n‘matrimonial alliance’ for the tastes of most people, but there are even\r\nmore commercial methods in existence. People who want wives or husbands\r\nsometimes find it advisable to make their wants public by\r\nadvertisement--a method of proceeding which is very commonly practised\r\nin some of the northern and manufacturing districts. Matrimonial\r\nadvertisements are excluded from the respectable journals of the\r\nmetropolis, but the scarcely less influential and respectable journals\r\nof the cotton capital insert them readily and receive the answers. They\r\nare generally very matter-of-fact--romance would, indeed, be out of\r\nplace in such a connection. Now and then some of them are, however,\r\ncomic enough. ‘A handsome young gentleman, aged twenty-three, wishes to\r\ncorrespond with a young lady with not less than £300 a year,’ was an\r\nadvertisement which appeared several times in one of the journals of\r\nCottonopolis. Whether the advertiser’s expectations were ever realised\r\nthe present writer is, of course, unable to say; but from his own\r\nexperience he is inclined to think it rather doubtful. Some few months\r\nback, having nothing very particular to do, he inserted an advertisement\r\nin a certain Manchester newspaper, stating that ‘a young professional\r\nman, handsome, amiable, and intelligent, and possessing an income of\r\n£500 a year, was anxious to meet with a suitable mate.’ The replies came\r\nin shoals. Within four days, between sixty and seventy letters were\r\nreceived, all, with one exception, evidently _bonâ fide_. The exception\r\nwas a high-flown composition written in a disguised hand, and on paper\r\nprofusely scented with musk. Of the remainder, the majority were rather\r\ntouching. A great many came from servant girls, who always included two\r\nthings in their applications: first, they declared that their parents\r\nwere eminently respectable--generally professional men--and that it was\r\nonly through family misfortunes that they had been compelled to ‘go to\r\nservice;’ and secondly, they treated their correspondent to a great deal\r\nof bad spelling and worse grammar. The following is a verbatim copy of\r\none of these communications:--‘Dear Sir. Having notised your\r\nadvertizment we beg to offer ourselves. Are 2 sisters Lottie twenty one\r\nand dark hand tall and Tottie fair and pritty which I never hexpected to\r\ngo to survice having always been brought up quite genteel. I am Sir\r\nYours and c. ---- ----. P.S. Please adress your letter _Miss_ ----.’\r\nYoung ladies in shops and warehouses contributed somewhat liberally to\r\nthe batch of answers. They generally wrote the flashy hand taught at\r\n‘young ladies’ seminaries,’ and sometimes quoted poetry of a tender\r\ncharacter. The grammar of their epistles was, however, somewhat dubious,\r\nand their spelling worse than that of a charity-school boy. Strangest of\r\nall was the following, which was written in a beautifully firm and\r\nlady-like hand upon good paper:--‘I have seen your challenge to the\r\nladies in the ----, and I fancy it must be genuine, and that you expect\r\nit to be taken up in all frankness.... I am twenty-five, and am the\r\ndaughter of a solicitor. I have been well educated, and you may judge of\r\nmy personal appearance by the enclosed carte-de-visite. I shall be\r\nentitled on my marriage to about £5,000 in the funds, and at my mother’s\r\ndeath I expect to receive a similar amount. My reason for this bold and\r\nperhaps imprudent letter is that I am tired of home, which is too stiff\r\nand formal for me. If you would like to know more about me you must give\r\nme all particulars about yourself. Write to Miss ----, under cover to\r\n----.’ The portrait enclosed was that of a really handsome girl of about\r\nthe age mentioned in the letter. The name given was one not altogether\r\nunknown to the writer, and the person under cover to whom the reply was\r\nto be sent was evidently a servant. It need scarcely be said that the\r\nmatter went no further, and that the carte was returned forthwith.\r\nStill, it is rather melancholy to think of what may be the fate of this\r\ngirl. She evidently suspected no harm, and she confided in an utter\r\nstranger with singular frankness and simplicity. In all human\r\nprobability she would become the prey of the first fortune-hunting\r\nscoundrel who came across her path, unless she had, as the writer\r\nsincerely hopes, a big brother with a strong arm and a thick stick.”\r\n\r\nWe have before us at the present moment an accumulation of the very\r\nextraordinary applications for wives and husbands which are constantly\r\nappearing in the cheap publications of the day, but the specimens\r\nalready given will doubtless be found sufficient for the purpose. Two\r\nfrom our heap, however, we feel in duty bound to give, not because they\r\nare very different from the rest we have garnered, but because they are\r\nfair samples of a style often adopted by the Benedicks and Beatrices of\r\nthe _London Journal_. One is from a lady and the other from a gentleman.\r\nLet us take the lady first:--\r\n\r\n  AGENORIA says that she has natural golden-brown hair, fair oval face,\r\n  laughing mischievous eyes, dark arched eyebrows, roguish expression of\r\n  countenance, is eighteen, ladylike, sensible, merry, good-natured,\r\n  highly respectable, and has good expectations. She longs to be married\r\n  to a tall, studious, benevolent, affectionate, well-principled\r\n  gentleman, who would think it a pleasure to instruct and assist her\r\n  endeavours to obtain a thorough knowledge of English, French, and\r\n  drawing; and in return she would try to be an apt pupil, and a loving\r\n  and obedient wife.\r\n\r\nThe pseudonyms adopted by these young ladies are often provokingly\r\nfunny: sometimes loving hearts take the name of a favourite heroine,\r\nwhose virtues and temptations, joys and sorrows, are at the time\r\nattracting their attention in the _Journal_; but sometimes they take\r\nhigher flights, and in attempting high-sounding names they have heard,\r\nsucceed in inventing others, just as the old chemists, in trying to\r\ndiscover the philosopher’s stone, found things much more valuable--with\r\nthe difference, of course, that the new titles are only valuable to\r\nfuture writers of the fiction believed in most by the fair\r\ncorrespondents. Agenoria requires a good deal, but her effort is of the\r\nweakest compared with that of our next friend, who, provided he had a\r\nbig stick, would prove himself a true hero--say on a box of eggs:--\r\n\r\n  L. S. W., twenty-one, dark, and considered handsome, lithe in figure,\r\n  of the medium height, and of a good family, would like to receive the\r\n  carte-de-visite of a young lady, a blond preferred. He is shortly\r\n  going abroad, probably to Mexico, or some of the republics adjacent,\r\n  where he intends to make a name and fortune. He is very ambitious, and\r\n  intends joining an army where there is active service. He wants a wife\r\n  who would encourage his plans and undertakings. One who would share\r\n  with him the toils of a camp life, or who would rule in Courts. One\r\n  who would receive homage from the savage tribes of Northern and\r\n  Central America, or would maintain her husband’s position as an\r\n  officer and gentleman of honour both at home and at Court. He is of a\r\n  very loving disposition, though rather hasty, and to a lady who would\r\n  do as he wished he would be an affectionate, loving husband,\r\n  companion, and protector.\r\n\r\nThat matrimonial clubs or agencies are still in existence is shown by a\r\ncase tried quite recently before Sir James Hannen in the Divorce\r\nCourt--a wife’s petition for a judicial separation on the ground of her\r\nhusband’s cruelty. The counsel for the petitioner stated that she was a\r\nlady of property, residing in Liverpool, and that the respondent was a\r\nclerk in a firm in the same town. He was a member of a Matrimonial Club,\r\nwhose object was to secure for its members wives with good fortunes; and\r\nas an instance of what kind of alliances result from the interference of\r\nthese establishments, we give some of the evidence. The respondent,\r\nwhose chief object was to get money, was very violent on finding soon\r\nafter the marriage that his wife had not nearly so much as he had\r\nanticipated. He was guilty of drunkenness and assaults, and treated his\r\nwife in a very brutal manner. The petitioner said that her father died\r\non Christmas Day, 1866. On his death she had an income of £400 for her\r\nseparate use. She made the acquaintance of the respondent some two or\r\nthree years before, and he was at that time a clerk in a firm of\r\nshipbrokers. At the marriage no settlement was made; but a few days\r\nafter the respondent asked for any papers she might have. She gave him\r\nthem. She had £675 in a building society, and he wrote out a form that\r\nshe signed, and the money was transferred to him. He often said that\r\n£400 per annum was a very paltry sum, and that if he had a few thousands\r\nhe could go into business. Petitioner’s mother had a considerable sum,\r\nand her name being the same, had led the defendant into the error of\r\nmarrying a woman with only a “paltry £400 a year,” instead of a lot of\r\nready money. Soon after the marriage he took to drinking, and was\r\nviolent in his language. The latter, the petitioner believed, arose from\r\nhis being disappointed at the smallness of her fortune. She found a\r\nletter of a very immoral character addressed to her husband. She was\r\nmuch annoyed, and sent the letter to the office. When the respondent\r\nreturned he brought a friend with him, and used most violent language.\r\nAfter the friend had gone to bed the respondent pulled her on to the\r\nfloor, bit her in the neck, ground her beads into powder, and bit a\r\npiece out of a glass. This latter act, it must be admitted, is a rather\r\nnovel way of showing disappointment, even in matters like these. The\r\nfriend was at once called for, and assisted to hold the disappointed man\r\ndown. In August 1870 defendant tore a piece of skin from her arm. He had\r\nbeen drinking for some time, and tried to prevent her seeing her mother,\r\nwho only lived a few hundred yards away. The mother was doubtless a sore\r\npoint with him. He said that once a month was often enough to see her,\r\nbut witness went more frequently. The family doctor saw the injuries\r\nwhich she sustained. In the same month the respondent called her very\r\nfoul names, and threatened to strangle her and throw her out of the\r\nwindow. His threats were so violent that she never expected to see the\r\nmorning. On one occasion he came home drunk, and partook of three large\r\nbottles of champagne. This would be a dangerous experiment for a sober\r\nman to make in these degenerate days. Afterwards he fell backwards, and\r\nshe had to stay with him all night. In March 1871 she went to her\r\nmother’s to tea, and when she returned he used very bad language, and\r\nmade all sorts of charges about her conduct, which were false. When\r\nsober, he said she ought not to take any notice of this. Her first child\r\nwas born in 1870, and her medical adviser told her to go away. She was\r\nanxious to take the child with her, which her husband would not allow,\r\nand during her absence he sent it from home. On hearing of this she at\r\nonce returned, and he refused to tell her where the child was, until\r\nshe wrote a letter which he forced her to write. On a Sunday after this\r\nhe returned home drunk, and when she remonstrated with him, he said that\r\nhe was not half drunk, but soon would be so. He then took the decanters\r\nout of the cupboard, and threw them at her. This was, to say the least,\r\neccentric, as a means to the end of drunkenness. She was so frightened\r\nat his conduct that she had to seek protection amongst neighbours. On\r\nthe 20th of December witness was in the house alone with respondent, who\r\nthreatened to kill her, stating that he often wished to do so, and now\r\nthat they were alone there was a good opportunity. He then got hold of\r\nthe carving-knife, and stood over her with it. He then said that would\r\nnot do, but a pistol or razor would. Corroborative evidence as to the\r\nviolence was given by the doctor who attended the petitioner, and\r\nnoticed bruises on her; and by a servant who formerly lived with the\r\nparties to the suit. His lordship granted a decree of judicial\r\nseparation, with costs, the wife to have the custody of the child.\r\nMarriage for money and money alone, without any consideration as to\r\nwhether the contracting persons are at all suited to each other, is\r\nalmost bound to end in unpleasantness, more especially when the\r\nfortune-hunter finds that he has married the daughter instead of the\r\nmother, and has only a “paltry £400 a year” and a little ready money to\r\nsubsist on.\r\n\r\nThere is at the present time in London a weekly newspaper specially\r\ndevoted to the interests of those who wish to marry or to give in\r\nmarriage, and as the copy we have before us under date May 9, 1874, is\r\nnumbered 214, and is full of advertisements all referring to the holy\r\nstate of matrimony, it is to be presumed that the supply is caused by a\r\nmost undoubted demand for an organ of intercommunication between kindred\r\nsouls which scorn to be trammelled by ordinary social restrictions, or\r\nto which conventionalities can bring no balm. Love is a fierce flame,\r\nand people who feel it burning within them, and know no object on whom\r\nto bestow the priceless blessing, are apt to try any short cut that\r\noffers itself, instead of biding their time and going the ordinary\r\nslow-coach road which lumbering old-fashioned etiquette suggests.\r\nTherefore we take up our paper with interest, and receive with pleasure\r\nthe intimation that it is “a weekly journal devoted to the promotion of\r\nmarriage and conjugal felicity.” We say pleasure advisedly, for most\r\neditors would have been satisfied to promote marriage, and have let the\r\nsubsequent felicity look after itself. We must admit that we fail to\r\nfind any further reference to the future happiness of couples in our\r\ncopy; perhaps it is to be secured by a regular supply of the newspaper,\r\nso that those already done for may see how the remaining lovers are\r\ngetting on. On the front page there are ten “rules and regulations” to\r\nbe complied with by advertisers, the most important of which seems to be\r\nthat “_bona fide_ notices from ladies and gentlemen desirous of marrying\r\nwill be inserted at the rate of twelve stamps per forty words,” with a\r\nreduction by taking a quantity, and that “all introductions are given on\r\nthe understanding that the lady and gentleman shall each pay a fee to\r\nthe editor within a month after marriage.” Why these are called rules\r\nand regulations we don’t pretend to know. The editor also offers, as one\r\nof the rules, to give advice on the subject of courtship or marriage, by\r\nwhich it would appear that he has had an extended experience of both.\r\nYet this supposition is hardly borne out by a request--also one of the\r\nten regulations--for contributions “calculated to enlighten the public\r\nmind in reference to marriage and other kindred subjects.” Maybe, great\r\nas is the editor’s own knowledge of marriage “and other kindred\r\nsubjects,” he cannot write equal to the demands of such a topic.\r\nCertainly he and his advertisers have the most original ideas of both\r\northography and syntax. Maybe also, the “address to the public,” which\r\nadds to the front-page glories, has been enough for him in the way of\r\nhard literary labour. It is certainly very nice, though short; and we\r\nregret that no such cunning hand could be obtained to give a few opening\r\nlines for the present chapter. But better late than never, and so we\r\nwill borrow the “address” now. “Marriage,” says the editor, “is such an\r\nancient institution, and has in all ages excited such universal interest\r\namong the human family, that in offering to the public a journal\r\nspecially devoted to the promotion of marital felicity, we feel sure we\r\nare only supplying a national want. Civilisation, combined with the cold\r\nformalities of society and the rules of etiquette, imposes such\r\nrestrictions on the sexes, that there are thousands of marriageable men\r\nand women, of all ages, capable of making each other happy, who never\r\nhave a chance of meeting, either in town or country; therefore, the\r\ndesirability of having some organ through which ladies and gentlemen\r\naspiring to marriage can be honourably brought into communication, is\r\ntoo obvious to need demonstration; and as we are resolved to devote our\r\nbest energies to advance the interests and happiness of our readers and\r\ncorrespondents, we feel sure the _Matrimonial News_ will meet with a\r\ngenerous support.” This appeal seems to have met with a good response,\r\nas there are no less than 331 advertisements of various lengths, all\r\nrelating to marriage, in the number before us. It is noticeable,\r\nhowever, that many of them have a striking family likeness, and a\r\npeculiarity of constructive style is evidenced by a great number in each\r\ncolumn. It is hardly fair to suppose that half-a-dozen ladies of forty\r\nanxious for husbands would describe themselves as orphans, yet we find\r\nno less than eight ladies in one page, all content with that\r\nclassification, whose united ages amount to 313 years, one being\r\nthirty-five, another thirty-eight, and six admitting to be forty each;\r\nbut these are insignificant compared with a poor young thing who appears\r\nclose by, and whose application runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  227 AN orphan LADY, aged 52, of good connexions, and an income of £160\r\n  a year, wishes to hear from a gentleman not under 60. Address with\r\n  Editor.\r\n\r\nThis orphan business may be partly an intimation that there are no\r\nmothers-in-law to fear, besides being an appeal to the charitable to\r\nprevent giddy young creatures straying into harm’s way. The columns of\r\nthis unique journal are also strong in the military, several colonels\r\nand some other officers being anxious to commit matrimony.\r\n\r\nFrom 331 advertisements, all peculiar, it is hard to make anything like\r\na judicial selection; but there are a few specimens we have determined\r\non giving, even though others must suffer and be left in the cold shade\r\nof neglect. We will commence with\r\n\r\n  245 A WIDOWER, aged 60, healthy and active, with a business of about\r\n  £150 a year, wishes to correspond with a well educated lady, from 40\r\n  to 50 with a view to early marriage. Address with Editor.\r\n\r\nThis will doubtless throw a new light on the question of early\r\nmarriages, which seems to have been hitherto handled in a selfish and\r\none-sided manner. Sixty and fifty can hardly ever be “too early wed.”\r\nNext we come upon\r\n\r\n  124 CATHLEEN, aged 30, a Widow LADY, without children, income £7,000,\r\n  residing in a handsome house, surrounded by a park of 200 acres,\r\n  within 50 miles of London, would correspond with a Nobleman or\r\n  Gentleman of position, with a view to marriage. Address with Editor.\r\n\r\nProbably there are many noblemen and gentlemen with whom Cathleen mixes\r\nin daily intercourse who do not dream that she wishes to be married\r\nagain, and she is of course too much a lady to let them know the state\r\nof her feelings. Which accounts for her confiding in the editor, who\r\nmust be a perfect Pantechnicon of secrets. The intelligent foreigner is\r\nnot blind to the advantages of advertising for what he requires, as\r\nwitness\r\n\r\n  9982 A Spanish GENTLEMAN, aged 30 years, residing at Seville\r\n  (Andalusia), tall, good looking, very swell, rather a meriodinal type,\r\n  an income of £1,000. He knows English thoroughly, and would like to\r\n  correspond with the following ladies: Nos. 9442, 9697, 9646, and 9710.\r\n  Address with Editor.\r\n\r\nHe knows English better than we do in England, if he understands what a\r\n“meriodinal type” is; and the editor doesn’t offer to explain. But the\r\nlatter is evidently too interested in the following to trouble himself\r\nwith small and foreign fry:--\r\n\r\n  195 A BACHELOR, 32, height 6 feet, strong, fair and considered good\r\n  looking, closely connected with nobility, and moving in the best\r\n  county society, one brother inherits entailed estates and two in the\r\n  army, a member of one of the most particular west-end clubs, residence\r\n  family mansion beautifully situated on the bank of a large river,\r\n  disposition amiable and energetic, would not mind getting married, if\r\n  I could meet a suitable wife. She must be of a loveable disposition,\r\n  good figure and pleasing face, and have a fortune of not less than\r\n  £10,000 to enable me to buy out the other partner in a large\r\n  manufactory which cost £23,000, and yealds over £3,000 per annum,\r\n  without which I will not become a benedict for years. Would like\r\n  communicate with 9920, 9852, or 9803. Address L. M. A., Editor M. N.,\r\n  282, Strand.\r\n\r\nThese figures refer, of course, to young ladies who have advertised for\r\nthe connections of the nobility in previous numbers. When the School\r\nBoard has done with the children of costermongers and other plebeians,\r\nit will have to turn its attention to the members of particular West-End\r\nclubs, whose education seems to have been somewhat neglected, so far as\r\ngrammar is concerned. Should the fair creatures referred to by L. M. A.\r\nbe already suited, or the inducements held out be insufficient for them,\r\nour next may be worthy of his attention:--\r\n\r\n  284 A Young LADY, tall, fair, and beautiful, with a great profusion of\r\n  golden hair, and an income of £800 a year, wishes to correspond with a\r\n  gentleman of position with a view to marriage. Editor has address.\r\n\r\nQuite a modern Miss Kilmansegg, with the advantage of having the\r\ntypical adornment in the shape of golden hair instead of a golden leg.\r\nThis reference to poetry is of great advantage, as it puts us in a\r\nproper frame to consider the following:--\r\n\r\n    “Oh, woman, in our hours of ease,\r\n    Uncertain, coy, and hard to please;\r\n    When pain or sickness rend the brow,\r\n    A ministering angel thou.”\r\n\r\n  9828 A Young WIDOW, highly connected, dark hair and eyes, considered\r\n  pretty, good income, desires to marry, she does not deny that she\r\n  might at times realize the two first lines of the couplet quoted\r\n  above, but she can assure any gentleman willing to make the experiment\r\n  that she is as certain to be true to the conclusion. Address with\r\n  Editor.\r\n\r\nEven Scott has to succumb to the grammatical requirements of the\r\nmarriage advocate and its readers; but the alteration from the original\r\nis as nothing compared with the reference to “the two first lines of the\r\ncouplet.” There is poetry of a different kind in the next specimen,\r\nwhich deserves particular attention:--\r\n\r\n  45 I am a BACHELOR, 28, tall and gentlemanly. My income being £150\r\n  only (though prospects good), I seek an amiable, educated wife, with\r\n  private means. Should 10,000, 9920, 9851, 9960, Geraldine, Miss Kate,\r\n  Miss Maxwell, 9852, 9828, 9878, 9885, or other lady under 28, with at\r\n  least £2,000 in own control, deem my position compatible with her\r\n  views, I should much like to correspond. I am well educated, of\r\n  refined and intellectual tastes, fond of literature and home, of sound\r\n  moral principles, eschewing smoking, drinking, gambling, and all fast\r\n  life delusions, of undoubted respectability, unquestionable honour and\r\n  integrity, of equable temper, and kind, generous heart. Believing a\r\n  true wife to be man’s greatest blessing, I fully intend being a good\r\n  husband or none at all, and shall treat my wife not merely with the\r\n  courtesy due to a lady, but with the respectful consideration to a\r\n  woman. As this is bona fide, inviolable honour observed and expected.\r\n  Particulars of age, income, and disposition respectfully solicited.\r\n  Address with Editor.\r\n\r\nO true poetic soul longing for a mate! O noble heart of undoubted\r\nrespectability and unquestionable honour! may you go on and prosper!\r\nEven teetotalism can be fervid, and an equable temper may become\r\nquickened, when matrimony stirs up the feelings; and so catching is the\r\nimpulse, that we should like to fold this young man to our breast, and\r\npresent him with our favourite daughter. But she hasn’t got £2000, and\r\nso, regretting the circumstance, we pass on to\r\n\r\n  8672 A PHYSICIAN of noble lineage (of French and English extraction),\r\n  of statue about 5ft. 8 inches, aged 36 years, of dark complexion, with\r\n  black hair and eyes, possessing a strong and healthy constitution,\r\n  desires to form the acquaintance, with a view to matrimony, of a Lady\r\n  from 19 to 23 or 24 years, who must be of a noble family or the upper\r\n  class; brunette preferred, if not of a medium complexion with black or\r\n  dark hair, and eyes having a fine physique, with some embonpoint,\r\n  pretty, of an affectione disposition, with a heart true and loving,\r\n  talented, speaking or understanding French and Italian, or the other\r\n  foreign languages; in height about 5 feet 6 to 8 inches. Also must\r\n  possess in her own right considerable fortune, and having no\r\n  incumbrance preferred. In effect a Girl who can ever love a man with\r\n  an affectionate disposition. Photograph and address with Editor.\r\n\r\nThis noble physician evidently wishes for a wife whom he may eventually\r\nstuff and exhibit, even if he does not take her “round the country”\r\nduring life. Few people would object to paying sixpence or so to see,\r\namong other things, eyes having a fine physique; and so we trust 8672\r\nmay get the wife he wishes for. She would, however, if existent, as a\r\nmatter of natural selection prefer our next friend, and then they could\r\nmutually rejoice over each other’s tastes and peculiarities:--\r\n\r\n  9971 VEGETARIAN, a young man who does not use flesh as food; a Roman\r\n  Catholic, humble, well-educated, and connected. A lover of temperance,\r\n  truth, literature, fruit, flowers, and economy, income about £80 a\r\n  year, wishes for a wife with similar tastes, principles, and income,\r\n  or as nearly so as possible.--The address with Editor.\r\n\r\nThe fact of being connected is such an entirely new qualification, that\r\nwe feel compelled to pause and wonder; and this will be an opportunity\r\nfor withdrawing from a perusal which is very fascinating, but which\r\nthreatens to prolong this chapter unduly. There are many more noticeable\r\nadvertisements, but those we have given will be sufficient to show the\r\ncharacter of the newspaper from which we have selected them, as well as\r\nthe credulity of its public, who are either gulled into paying for\r\nmatrimonial applications, or deluded into purchasing it in the hope that\r\nby its means husbands or wives may be secured. That Oxford “double\r\nfirsts,” Cambridge wranglers, members of Parliament, military and naval\r\nofficers of high rank, peers of the realm, and beneficed clergymen,\r\nwould send twaddling and ungrammatical advertisements to this paper, so\r\nas to secure wives, we no more believe than we do that eminent\r\nauthoresses and ladies of rank and property would avail themselves of\r\nits services to secure to themselves husbands. If we are wrong, and\r\nthese advertisements are all _bonâ fide_, and what they profess to be,\r\nthen a paternal Government, which legislates against betting and strong\r\ndrink, which puts a tax on quack medicines, and subscribes to compulsory\r\neducation, should fulfil its _métier_ by preventing the public exposure\r\nof idiotcy we have just been contemplating, more especially as no good\r\ncan possibly be the outcome of it.\r\n\r\n  [46] This Mrs Cornelys was a notoriety of the period. She lived at\r\n  Carlisle House, Soho Square, where she, coming from Germany, of which\r\n  country she was a native, settled in or about 1756. Her business was\r\n  to entertain “the votaries of fashion of both sexes” with masked and\r\n  other balls, and suchlike festivities. Mrs Cornelys seems to have\r\n  thoroughly understood the advantages of judicious puffery, and her\r\n  advertisements usually appeared as news paragraphs. On February 18,\r\n  1763, there appeared a good specimen of the kind of notice she most\r\n  affected. It says, “On Saturday last Mrs Cornelys gave a ball at\r\n  Carlisle House, to the upper servants of persons of fashion, as a\r\n  token of the sense she has of her obligations to the nobility and\r\n  gentry, for their generous subscription to her assembly. The company\r\n  consisted of 220 persons, who made up fourscore couple in country\r\n  dances; and as scarce anybody was idle on this occasion, the rest sat\r\n  down to cards.” Carlisle House was kept open by means of annual\r\n  subscriptions, and the fast young men of the period, and not a few\r\n  older sinners, patronised the establishment. Rules and regulations\r\n  were published, and from them we learn that members’ tickets were\r\n  transferable provided the name of the holder was written on the back.\r\n  There are in the papers between 1757 and 1772 frequent references to\r\n  the grand doings at this notorious place of assignation; but\r\n  notwithstanding all her customers and her various ways of making\r\n  money, Mrs Cornelys’s name appears in a _Gazette_ of November in the\r\n  latter year among the bankrupts. She is described as “Teresa Cornelys,\r\n  Carlisle House, St Ann, Soho, dealer.” This, however, says very little\r\n  as to her success or the want of it, for bankruptcy meant anything but\r\n  ruin a hundred years ago, if one had only money enough to break\r\n  properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n_HANDBILLS, INSCRIPTIONS, ETC._\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this head it is our intention to give some slight insight into\r\npeculiarities of a kind of advertising unconnected with newspapers, and\r\nindependent of any of the subjects treated in preceding chapters. We set\r\nforth with a great variety of handbills, which seemed almost too\r\nextensive for use in this volume; but we have already got rid of so many\r\nthat the task of disposal is considerably lightened--so lightened,\r\nindeed, by the absorption of many of the most characteristic into\r\npreceding pages, that by comparison with the original collection our\r\npresent supply seems rather meagre. It will doubtless, however, be found\r\nsufficient for the requirements of readers. We have already given an\r\noutline of the history of advertising by means of bills and posters, and\r\nhave referred to the gradual growth of the system of “billing” until it\r\nhas attained its present proportions. This system, though regarded by\r\nthe Board of Works as very objectionable, is far pleasanter than that\r\nadopted twenty years ago, when every billsticker considered it his\r\nbounden duty to overstick the placards of opponents, and when nothing\r\nbut a long course of education, or a most vivid imagination, would\r\nenable the passer-by to read what was upon the dead walls and hoardings.\r\nThe Board of Works certainly took the initiative at the wrong time--at\r\nthe time when improvement was vast and apparent to every one; but as it\r\nfailed in its object, we may consider that public opinion has admitted\r\nthe improvement, and no longer regards wall-advertising as a nuisance.\r\nThe Board doubtless started on the idea at a time when placarding was a\r\nmost decided scandal, but it--like most other committees--took so long\r\nto bring the idea to perfection, that the scandal had abolished itself\r\nlong before the Board was ready to abolish it. Having already entered\r\ninto full particulars as to the modes formerly adopted, and contrasted\r\nthem with those in use at the present time, individual efforts at\r\nilluminating the public mind will now be found amply sufficient for our\r\npurpose. Some of these are, as all the world knows, extremely funny on\r\naccount of the vagueness of the writers, and in that particular resemble\r\nmany of those we have instanced from the columns of newspapers. A very\r\nfew examples of this kind will suffice, and will pave the way for the\r\nheavier material. One of the best of those inscriptions, the comicality\r\nof which is founded upon ignorance, appeared in 1821, and was posted up\r\nby order of Lord Camden in that portion of the county of Kent which\r\ncalled him owner. It said:--\r\n\r\n  Notice is hereby given, that the Marquis of Camden (on account of the\r\n  backwardness of the harvest) will not shoot himself, nor any of his\r\n  tenants, till the 14th of September.\r\n\r\nWe don’t suppose that the Marquis had anything to do with the actual\r\nwording of the notice, but he has always been identified with it, and\r\ndoubtless was cruelly badgered about it at the time. Another lordly\r\nnotice of a similar kind appeared a few years back at Osterly Park, near\r\nBrentford, the seat of the Earl of Jersey, which gave the public this\r\ninformation: “Ten shillings reward.--Any person found trespassing on\r\nthese lands or damaging these fences on conviction will receive the\r\nabove reward. Dogs poisoned.” Somebody once said that nobody expects to\r\nfind education or ability in a lord, but that is because his household\r\nare expected to fulfil his duties properly. Lords would seem in imminent\r\ndanger of having to pick up a little scholarship, and use it in the\r\ninterest of their dependants. If so, polo and pigeon-shooting will\r\nlanguish, and West-End night-schools may become fashionable. But getting\r\naway from the aristocracy, and turning our attention to the other side\r\nof the social sphere, we don’t find matters anyway improved, if we are\r\nto judge by the specimens of literary ability which now and then address\r\nthemselves to the curious pedestrian. In Lambeth the latter might some\r\nshort time back have been terrified by an announcement in a baker’s\r\nshop, which informed all whom it might concern that _vitals_ were baked\r\nthere. Not so terrible, but more comical, is the following, which is\r\ncopied from an announcement in the window of a shop at Chatham: “The\r\npublic are requested not to confound this shop with that of another\r\nswindler who has established himself on the other side of the way.”\r\nThere is a story told of two rival shoemakers, one of whom astonished\r\nhis opponent by the inscription, “Mens conscia recti.” He was not\r\nallowed his triumph unalloyed, for the other, after puzzling over the\r\nnotice for some days, divined that it was some new name for\r\n“understandings,” and feeling sure there was nothing in the opposition\r\nshop that was not in his own, replied with this, “Men’s and women’s\r\nconscia recti may be obtained here.” This story, however, requires\r\nconfirmation, as does that of the two provincial photographers. One is\r\nsaid to have placed over his studio, “The acme of photography,” to which\r\nhis enemy and neighbour replied, “Photography in the very height of\r\nacme.” Salt seems necessary to both of these, but we are informed on\r\ngood authority that the next one is quite true. A correspondent says\r\nthat the following is a verbatim copy of a sign formerly to be seen over\r\na shoemaker’s shop in the village of Heallan, near Denbigh, Wales. The\r\nschoolmaster would seem to have been a long way abroad when the sign was\r\ncomposed:--\r\n\r\n  Pryce Dyas, Coblar, daler in Bacco Shag and Pig tail, Bacon and\r\n  Ginarbread Eggs laid every morning by me, and very good Paradise, in\r\n  the Summer, Gentlemen and Lady can have good Tae and Crumquets and\r\n  Strawburry with a scim milk, because I can’t get no cream.--N.B. Shuse\r\n  and Boots mended very well.\r\n\r\nOf a similar kind is the following, which was, years back, copied from a\r\nbill in the window of a small house near Lancaster:--\r\n\r\n  James Williams, parish clerk, saxtone, town crier, and bellman, makes\r\n  and sells all sorts of haberdasharies, groceries, &c.; likewise, hair\r\n  and wigs drest and cut on the shortest notice. N.B.--I keeps an\r\n  evening scool, where I teach, at reasonable rates, reading, riting,\r\n  and rithmitic, and singing. N.B.--I play the hooboy occasionally if\r\n  wanted. N.B.--My shop is next door, where I bleed, draw teeth, and\r\n  shoo horses, with the greatest scil. N.B.--Children taut to dance if\r\n  agreeable at 6d. per week, by me, J. Williams, who buy and sell old\r\n  iron, and coats--boots and shoos cleaned and mended. N.B.--A hat and\r\n  pr of stockens to be cudgelled for, the best in 5, on Shrof Tushday.\r\n  For particulars encuire within, or at the horse shoo and bell, near\r\n  the church, on t’other side the way. N.B.--Look over the dore for the\r\n  sign of the 3 pidgeons. N.B.--I sells good ayle, and sometimes cyder.\r\n  Lodgings for single men. N.B.--I teach jografy, algebry, and them\r\n  outlandish kind of things. A ball on Wednesdays and Fridays.\r\n\r\nThe next quaint window inscription, which treats of the troubles of a\r\nsmall shopkeeper, may also be depended upon, it being an exact copy of a\r\nwritten card suspended in the shop window of a tradesman in Horsemarket\r\nStreet, Warrington. One can conceive the amount of provocation undergone\r\nand the indignation felt by the honest purveyor of mousetraps, whose\r\nblood must have been at boiling point when he penned this:--\r\n\r\n  Notice I dont keep twelve hole mousetrap nor penney ones what i keep I\r\n  sell to respectable people not to impudent Boys Hand Bad Girls that\r\n  comes to rob me and annoy me and has bad parents those that come into\r\n  my shop shall be severely beat and put into the celler and took before\r\n  the magistrates those that come into a shop and ask for article that\r\n  is not made they must come to steal.\r\n\r\nExamples like this are manifold, and could be extended to great length,\r\nbut those we have given are quite enough to afford a vivid idea of the\r\ndanger of venturing upon literature without the precaution of first\r\nlearning the rudiments of education, and of the ridicule likely to\r\nattend upon any more than usually ambitious effort, which succeeds in\r\nlanding its perpetrator quite out of his depth.\r\n\r\nOld playbills offer a fruitful subject to the investigator, but their\r\nactual origin is hidden in the obscurity of ages. So far as their\r\nhistory goes, however, they are plentiful, and mention of them is made\r\nin works of a period far anterior to the date of any specimens extant.\r\nThe modern drama had its origin in an attempt to commemorate the\r\nmysteries of the Incarnation, from whence the plays were called\r\nmysteries; and it is recorded that one Gregory Nazianzen, an early\r\nfather of the Christian Church, constructed a drama on the Passion, for\r\nthe purpose of counteracting the profanities of the ancient plays, about\r\nthe year of our Lord 364. We have to pass over eight hundred years for\r\nthe next mention of dramatic representations, and then it is met in\r\nFitzstephen, who states that “London had for its theatrical exhibitions\r\nholy plays, and the representation of miracles wrote by holy\r\nconfessors.” This would be towards the close of the twelfth century; and\r\nnext we come to the Chester Mysteries, which were performed about 1270.\r\nThese have been reprinted during the present century, and the\r\napplication of the word mystery is explained in the two subjoined verses\r\nfrom the proclamation or prologue to the Whitsun Plays, a title by which\r\nthe famous Chester Mysteries were also known. The “moonke” mentioned is\r\nDone Rondali, of Chester Abbey, who founded the plays:--\r\n\r\n    This moonke, moonke-like in Scriptures well seene\r\n    In storyes travelled with the best sorte;\r\n    In pagentes set fourth, apparently to all eyne,\r\n    The Olde and Newe Testament with livelye comforte;\r\n    Intermynglinge therewith, onely to make Sporte,\r\n    Some things not warranted by any writt,\r\n    Which, to glad the hearers, he woulde men to take yt.\r\n\r\n    Now, you worshippfull Tanners, that of custome olde\r\n    The fall of Lucifer did set out,\r\n    Some writers awarrante your matter; therefore be boulde,\r\n    Lustily to playe the same to all the rowtte;\r\n    And yf any thereof stande in any doubte,\r\n    Your author his author hath, your shewe let bee,\r\n    Good speech, fyne players, with apparill comelye.\r\n\r\nWith the history of plays we have nothing to do, and need only state\r\nthat the first regular English tragedy was “Ferrex and Porrex,” which\r\nwas acted before Queen Elizabeth on the 18th of January 1561 by the\r\ngentlemen of the Inner Temple. This same play was tried at one of the\r\nminor theatres in 1854, but had no claim upon the tastes of the time.\r\nFrom a passage in Strype’s Life of Archbishop Grindall, it has been\r\nassumed that the custom of issuing bills, giving information concerning\r\nthe time, place, and nature of plays to be acted, came in with the plays\r\nthemselves, as it is there shown to exist prior to the year 1563. In\r\nalluding to Grindall’s objections to dramatic representations, Strype\r\nmentions that the Archbishop complained to Queen Elizabeth’s secretary\r\nthat the players “did then daily, but especially on the holidays, set up\r\ntheir _bills_, inviting to plays.” This, however, is a somewhat curious\r\nerror of Strype’s, into which Mr Payne Collier has also fallen. The\r\nBishop did not write _bills_ but _booths_; his words are as follows:\r\n“Common players, now daylie, but speciallye on holy dayes, set up\r\n_boothes_ whereunto the youthe resorteth excessively.” There is,\r\nhowever, other evidence to prove that playbills were in use not long\r\nafter the above date; for John Northbrooke, in his treatise against\r\ntheatrical performances, printed about 1579, says: “They use to set up\r\ntheir bills upon posts some certain days before, to admonish people to\r\nmake resort to their theatres.” At that time the Stationers’ Company had\r\nthe right of giving licences for the printing of playbills, and in the\r\nyear 1587 its Court of Assistants conferred upon John Charlewood the\r\nprivilege of being the sole printer of bills for players. Before that\r\ntime they were printed by one James Roberts, who names “the bills for\r\nthe players” amongst his publications as early as 1573--six years before\r\nNorthbrooke’s mention of them--and, authorised no doubt by Charlewood,\r\nhe continued to print them until after the year 1600. This right of\r\nprinting playbills was at a subsequent period assumed by the Crown. A\r\nbroadside, dated 1620, is preserved in the Library of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, by which this privilege was granted to a printing firm by\r\nJames I. It is entitled “An Abstract of his Majesty’s Letters Patent\r\ngranted unto Roger Wood and Thomas Symcocke, for the sole printing of\r\npaper and parchment on the one side.” Among the articles enumerated as\r\ncoming under this category are, “Bills for Playes, Pastimes, Showes,\r\nChallenges, Prizes, or Sportes whatsoever.” At the end the public are\r\ninformed that if they may want any work of that description, they need\r\nonly repair to Edward Allde (Wood and Symcocke’s assignee), “in the Old\r\nChange at the Golden Anchor, over against Carter Lane end, where they\r\nshall be reasonably dealt with for the same.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Malone these early playbills did not contain a list of the\r\ncharacters or of the names of the actors by whom they were represented.\r\nBut that the name of the author was sometimes, if not always, on the\r\nplaybill may be inferred from a passage in the anonymous play of\r\n“Histriomastix” (1610), act iv., in which Belch, speaking of Post-hast\r\nthe playwriter, says, “It is as dangerous to read his name at a play\r\ndore, as a printed bill on a plague dore,” the allusion being to the\r\npractice of writing “Lord have mercy upon us” on the doors of houses in\r\nwhich the plague had broken out, which words of course were a caution,\r\nand made people pass on hurriedly. In the same play also we find a\r\ncurious illustration of our subject in a reference to the part of one of\r\nthe inferior actors. In act iii. the stage direction says, “Enter Belch\r\nsetting up bills.” And it may not be out of place to remark that the\r\nword poster is evidently derived from the custom of sticking bills on\r\nposts. That bills were stuck on posts for choice, many of them at stated\r\nor customary places, there is plenty of evidence. Sometimes they were\r\nordered to be stuck upon doors and gates, as in the following, though\r\nthis very possibly means door or gate post. From the _Moderate\r\nIntelligencer_, March 18-25, 1647, we discover that in the time of civil\r\nwar, when the bishops’ lands and palaces were sold, the following places\r\nwere appointed by Parliament to be used for affixing bills concerning\r\nthe sales. Upon the outer gate and upon the hall door of Sir Richard\r\nGourney’s house in the Old Jewry (this was the office where the\r\ncommittee charged with those sales held their sitting), upon the north\r\ndoor of St Paul’s Church, upon the gate of Guildhall, and upon the gate\r\nof Blackwell Hall.\r\n\r\nAs long as they have had an existence--from the sixteenth century--these\r\nbills have gone by the name of playbills. In the prologue to the\r\nanonymous tragedy of “A Warning for Fair Women” (1599), Tragedy whips\r\nHistory and Comedy from the stage, exclaiming:--\r\n\r\n    ’Tis you have kept the theatre so long\r\n    Painted in Play bills upon every post,\r\n    While I am scornèd of the multitude.\r\n\r\nThey have also, however, in various places and at various times, been\r\ncalled “text bills for plays.” The natural and shorter title, though,\r\nalways overruled its more pretentious rival. From the prologue to\r\nShirley’s “Cardinal” (1652) it appears that it was usual to add on the\r\nbill whether the piece was a comedy or a tragedy. This “Cardinal” being\r\na tragedy, the author apologises in the following words for only calling\r\nit “a play” in the bills:--\r\n\r\n    Think what you please, we call it but a “play.”\r\n    Whether the comic muse, or lady’s love,\r\n    Romance, or direful tragedy it prove,\r\n    The bill determines not: and you would be\r\n    Persuaded I would have’t a comedy\r\n    For all the purple in the name.\r\n\r\nFrom which it may be inferred that the names of tragedies, for greater\r\ndistinction, were usually, or at all events occasionally, printed in red\r\nink. That the custom of posting playbills continued in the reign of\r\nCharles II. may be inferred from the following entry in Pepys’ Diary: “I\r\nwent to see if any play was acted and I found none upon the posts, it\r\nbeing Passion Weeke.”\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil Wars the drama had a hard struggle not to be swamped in\r\nthe deluge which destroyed all things appertaining to the pomp and\r\nluxury of the Court, or connected with pleasure generally. The face of\r\nthe Parliament was turned against stage-plays, and when the war broke\r\nout, one of the first measures was that which led to the publication of\r\nthe following bill:--\r\n\r\n  _Ordinance of the Lords and Commons concerning Stage-Plays._\r\n\r\n  ^Whereas,^\r\n\r\n  The distressed Estate of Ireland, steeped in her own Blood, and the\r\n  distracted Estate of England, threatened with a Cloud of Blood by a\r\n  civil War, call for all possible Means to appease and avert the Wrath\r\n  of God, appearing in these Judgements; amongst which Fasting and\r\n  Prayer, having been often tried to be very effectual, have been\r\n  lately, and are still, enjoined; And whereas public Sports do not well\r\n  agree with public Calamities, nor public Stage-plays with the Seasons\r\n  of Humiliation, this being an exercise of sad and pious Solemnity, and\r\n  the other being Spectacles of Pleasure too commonly expressing\r\n  lascivious Mirth and Levity; It is therefore thought fit, and ordered\r\n  by the Lords and Commons in this Parliament assembled, That while\r\n  these sad Causes and set Times of Humiliation do continue, public\r\n  Stage-plays shall cease and be forborne. Instead of which are\r\n  recommended to the People of this Land the profitable and seasonable\r\n  consideration of Repentance, Reconciliation, and Peace with God, which\r\n  probably will produce outward Peace and Prosperity, and bring again\r\n  Times of Joy and Gladness to these Nations.\r\n\r\nThis intimation was of course received with much outcry, and “The\r\nActors’ Remonstrance” was soon published. In it the writer complains\r\nnaturally of a law which robs the poor player of his livelihood, and\r\nallows bear-gardens and suchlike places to remain unmolested to the\r\ndelectation of “boisterous butchers, cutting cobblers, hard-handed\r\nmasons, and the like riotous disturbers of the public peace.” The\r\nplayhouses are defended against sundry charges brought against them, and\r\na promise is made that no female whatsoever shall be admitted unless\r\naccompanied by her husband or some male relative; besides which the use\r\nof tobacco is to be forbidden even in the threepenny galleries, except\r\nin the case of “the pure Spanish leaf.” It may thus be readily guessed\r\nthat something worse even than the cheap “sensation smokes” of the\r\npresent day was often misnamed tobacco. This is hard to believe,\r\nhowever. The promise extends to the expulsion of all ribaldry from the\r\nstage; and the actors say, “We will so demean ourselves as none shall\r\nesteem us of the ungodly, or have cause to repine at our actions or\r\ninterludes; we will not entertain any comedian that shall speak his part\r\nin a tone as if he did it in derision of some of the pious, but reform\r\nall our disorders and amend all our amisses.” During the Commonwealth,\r\nstage-plays were almost openly connived at; and the licence indulged in\r\nduring the Restoration days is too well known to require notice here.\r\n\r\nAn interesting epoch in the history of the drama is the first appearance\r\nof David Garrick, and it is noticeable that the playbill which\r\ncommemorates the event does not contain his name. Neither, for the\r\nmatter of that, does it contain the name of the author of the play, who,\r\nif Shakespeare, must have been improved and amended. The monopoly of the\r\npatent theatres was such that these plays had to be advertised and\r\nregarded as simply interludes to a musical entertainment. As witness:--\r\n\r\n  _October 19, 1741._\r\n\r\n  GOODMAN’S FIELDS.\r\n\r\n  At the late Theatre in Goodman’s Fields, this Day will be perform’d a\r\n  _Concert of Vocal_ and _Instrumental Music_, divided into two Parts.\r\n\r\n  Tickets at Three, Two and One Shilling.\r\n\r\n  Places for the Boxes to be taken at the Fleece Tavern, near the\r\n  Theatre.\r\n\r\n  N.B. Between the two Parts will be presented an Historical Play,\r\n  called the Life and Death of\r\n\r\n  KING RICHARD THE THIRD,\r\n\r\n  containing the Distresses of\r\n  KING HENRY VI.\r\n  The Artful Acquisition of the Crown by\r\n  KING RICHARD,\r\n  The Murder of the young King Edward V. and his Brother, in the\r\n  Tower,\r\n  The Landing of the Earl of Richmond,\r\n  And the Death of King Richard in the memorable Battle of Bosworth\r\n  Field, being the last that was fought between the\r\n  Houses of York and Lancaster.\r\n  With many other true historical Passages.\r\n\r\n  The Part of KING RICHARD _by a Gentleman_.\r\n  (_Who never appeared on any Stage._)\r\n\r\n  King Henry, by Mr. Giffard; Richmond, Mr. Marshall; Prince Edward, by\r\n  Miss Hippisley; Duke of York, Miss Naylor; Duke of Buckingham, Mr.\r\n  Peterson; Duke of Norfolk, Mr. Blades; Lord Stanley, Mr. Pagett;\r\n  Oxford, Mr. Vaughan; Tressel, Mr. W. Giffard; Catesby, Mr. Marr;\r\n  Rutcliff, Mr. Crofts; Blunt, Mr. Naylor; Tyrrell, Mr. Puttenham; Lord\r\n  Mayor, Mr. Dunstall; The Queen, Mrs. Steel; Duchess of York, Mrs.\r\n  Yates;\r\n\r\n  And the Part of Lady ANNE\r\n  By Mrs GIFFARD.\r\n\r\n  With Entertainments of Dancing\r\n\r\n  By Mons. Fromet, Madame Duvall, and the two Masters and Miss Granier.\r\n\r\n  To which will be added a _Ballad Opera_ of one Act, called\r\n\r\n  THE VIRGIN UNMASK’D.\r\n  The Part of Lucy by Miss HIPPISLEY.\r\n\r\n  Both of which will be performed Gratis by Persons for their Diversion.\r\n  The Concert will begin exactly at Six o’Clock.\r\n\r\nThis bill would seem to contradict an inscription in the large room at\r\nthe St John’s Gate Tavern, Clerkenwell, which is to the effect that\r\nGarrick made his first appearance on any stage there. The first\r\nappearance of David on any stage was at Ipswich, also in 1741, “where,\r\nunder the assumed name of Lyddul, he appeared as Aboan in the tragedy of\r\n‘Oroonoko.’” His acting at the East End of London was a decided\r\nsuccess, and the performances were continued for what was then\r\nconsidered an almost fabulous period. “The other theatres were quickly\r\ndeserted, and Goodman’s Fields became the resort of people of fashion,\r\neven from the West End, till that theatre was shut up.” The last\r\nperformance at Goodman’s Fields is said to have taken place on a Sunday.\r\nAnother playbill of the middle of the eighteenth century may be found\r\ninteresting, though for no such reasons as are found in that of\r\nGoodman’s Fields. It is redolent of the pride and poverty which seem to\r\nbe ever associated with the drama in days gone by, and is given by\r\nBoaden in his “Life of Mrs Siddons:”--\r\n\r\n  At the Old Theatre, in East Grinstead, on Saturday, May, 1758, will be\r\n  represented (by particular desire, and for the benefit of Mrs. P.) the\r\n  deep and affecting tragedy of\r\n\r\n  “THEODOSIUS, OR THE FORCE OF LOVE,”\r\n\r\n  with magnificent scenes, dresses, &c.\r\n\r\n  Varanes by Mr. P., who will strive, as far as possible, to support the\r\n  character of the fiery Persian Prince, in which he was so much admired\r\n  and applauded at Hastings, Arundel, Petworth, Midworth, Lewes, &c.\r\n\r\n  Theodosius by a young Gentleman from the University of Oxford, who\r\n  never appeared on any Stage.\r\n\r\n  Athenais by Mrs. P. Though her present Condition will not permit her\r\n  to wait on Gentlemen and Ladies out of the town with Tickets, she\r\n  hopes, as on former Occasions, for their Liberality and Support.\r\n\r\n  Nothing in Italy can exceed the Altar, in the first scene of the Play;\r\n  nevertheless should any of the Nobility or Gentry wish to see it\r\n  ornamented with Flowers, the Bearer will bring away as many as they\r\n  choose to favour him with.\r\n\r\n  As the coronation of Athenais, to be introduced in the fifth Act,\r\n  contains a number of Personages, more than sufficient to fill all the\r\n  dressing Rooms, &c., it is hoped no Gentlemen and Ladies will be\r\n  offended being refused admission behind the Scenes.\r\n\r\n  N.B. The great yard Dog, that made so much noise on Thursday night,\r\n  during the last Act of King Richard the Third, will be sent to a\r\n  Neighbour’s over the way; and on account of the prodigious demand for\r\n  places, part of the Stable will be laid into the Boxes on one side,\r\n  and the Granary be open for the same purpose on the other.\r\n\r\n  _Vivat Rex._\r\n\r\nThose who are curious in the matter of playbills in all languages will\r\nperhaps accept the annexed as a compromise, and as the nearest thing in\r\na general way we can manage in the space at command. Those also who are\r\ngood at riddles may like to try their skill on it:--\r\n\r\n  NOTICE.\r\n\r\n  SAturday 30 and on Sunday 31 of the corrent, in the Royal Theatre of\r\n  St. Charles will be represented by the Italian Company the famous Holy\r\n  Drama intitled\r\n\r\n  IL TRIONFO DI GIUDITTA\r\n\r\n  O SIA\r\n\r\n  LA MORTE D’ OLOFERNE.\r\n\r\n  In the interval of the first to the second act it shall have a new and\r\n  pompous Ball of the composition of John Baptista Gianini, who has by\r\n  title:\r\n\r\n  IL SACRIFICIO D’ ABRAMO\r\n\r\n  in which will enter all the excellent corp of Ball, who dance at\r\n  present in the said Royal Theatre; the spetacle will be finished with\r\n  the second act and Ball analog to the same Drama, all with the\r\n  nessessary decoration.\r\n\r\n  This is who is offered to the Respectable Publick of whom is waited\r\n  all the proctetion and concurrence:\r\n\r\n  _It will begin at 8 o’clok._\r\n\r\n  Na officina de Simāo Thaddeo Ferreira. 1811. Com licenca.\r\n\r\nWe next append a bill of the far-famed Richardson’s Theatre under date\r\n1825--one of those distributed during the Bartlemy Fair of that year.\r\nHone describes the theatre thus: “The outside of this show was in height\r\nupwards of thirty feet, and occupied one hundred feet in width. The\r\nplatform on the outside was very elevated; the back of it was lined with\r\ngreen baize, and festooned with deeply-fringed crimson curtains, except\r\nat two places, where the money-takers sat, which were wide and roomy\r\nprojections, fitted up like Gothic shrine-work, with columns and\r\npinnacles. There were fifteen hundred variegated illumination-lamps\r\ndisposed over various parts of the platform, some of them depending from\r\nthe top in the shape of chandeliers and lustres, and others in wreaths\r\nand festoons. A band of ten performers in scarlet dresses, similar to\r\nthose worn by beefeaters, continually played on clarionets, violins,\r\ntrombones, and the long drum; while the performers paraded in their\r\ngayest ‘properties’ before the gazing multitude. Audiences rapidly\r\nascended on each performance being over, and paying their money to the\r\nreceivers in their Gothic seats, had tickets in return; which being\r\ntaken at the doors, admitted them to descend into the ‘theatre.’” The\r\nbill is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  ⁂ Change of Performance each Day.\r\n\r\n  RICHARDSON’S\r\n  THEATRE.\r\n\r\n  _This Day will be performed, an entire New Melo-Drama, called the_\r\n  WANDERING\r\n  OUTLAW,\r\n  _Or, the Hour of Retribution_.\r\n\r\n  Gustavus, Elector of Saxony              Mr. Wright.\r\n  Orsina, Baron of Holstein                Mr. Cooper.\r\n  Ulric and Albert, Vassals to Orsina      Messrs.

The first is of the time of William and Mary, and\r\ngives itself in two languages, though, unlike the opera bill given a\r\npage or so back, it keeps them separate:--\r\n\r\n  A Raritie in Nature.\r\n\r\n  _Surpassing all Prodigies and\r\n  strange Births that ever were seen,\r\n  more admired by the Learned than\r\n  any sort of Creature that ever was\r\n  brought to_ England, _whose Body is\r\n  of different Colours, part white, part\r\n  brown and smooth, part Hairy like\r\n  a Satyr, with admirable unusual\r\n  growings out, that no reason can\r\n  be given for.

L’on la voit en toutes\r\n  heures du jour dans _Bell-savage-yard_\r\n  on _Ludgate Hill, London_.\r\n\r\n  VIVAT REX.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that the showman uses the common Latin form of “Vivat\r\nRex” under his French, and adopts an English equivalent in his other\r\ncolumn. About twenty years ago a similar creature was shown in London,\r\nand those who had her in charge vamped up most marvellous stories to\r\naccount for the _lusus naturæ_, both decency and probability being\r\noutraged in the attempt to excite a “sensation.” The next bill is,\r\nthough of the show series, of a totally different character, and refers\r\nto one of the exhibitions of the famous Figg, the swordsman and\r\npugilist. It is now the fashion to decry such adventures as that\r\nadvertised; but it is hard to believe that both Figg and Sutton were not\r\nfar more respectable characters than many who practise the licensed and\r\nmisnamed sport of modern times. For ourselves, we could have looked at\r\nsuch free agents as the rapier and backsword men, or even the more\r\ndegraded pugilists, doing their best and their worst on each other,\r\nrather than sit out an aristocratic pigeon match, assist at a battue, or\r\nbe party to the coursing of trapped hares and rabbits.\r\n\r\n  G. R.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  _At Mr. FIGG’s New Amphitheatre._\r\n\r\n  Joyning to his House, the Sign of the City of _Oxford_, in _Oxford\r\n  Road, Marybone Fields_, on _Wednesday_ next, being the _8th_ of\r\n  _June_, 1726. _Will be Perform’d a Tryal of Skill by the following_\r\n  Masters.\r\n\r\n  WHereas I _EDWARD SUTTON_, Pipemaker from _Gravesend_, and _Kentish_\r\n  Professor of the Noble Science of Defence, having, under a Sleeveless\r\n  Pretence been deny’d a Combat by and with the Extoll’d Mr. FIGG; which\r\n  I take to be occasioned through fear of his having that Glory Eclipsed\r\n  by me, wherewith the Eyes of all Spectators have been so much dazzled:\r\n  Therefore, to make appear, that the Great Applause which has so much\r\n  puff’d up this Hero, has proceeded only from his Foyling such who are\r\n  not worthy the name of Swordsmen, as also that he may be without any\r\n  farther Excuse; I do hereby dare the said Mr. FIGG to meet as above,\r\n  and dispute with me the Superiority of Judgment in the Sword (which\r\n  will best appear by Cuts, _&c._) at all the Weapons he is or shall be\r\n  then Capable of Performing on the Stage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  I _JAMES FIGG_, _Oxonian_ Professor of the said Science, will not fail\r\n  giving this daring _Kentish_ Champion an Opportunity to make good his\r\n  Allegations; when, it is to be hop’d, if he finds himself Foyl’d he\r\n  will then change his Tone, and not think himself one of the Number who\r\n  are not worthy the Name of Swordsmen, as he is pleased to signifie by\r\n  his Expression: However, as the most significant Way of deciding these\r\n  Controversies is by Action, I shall defer what I have farther to Act\r\n  till the Time above specified; when I shall take care not to deviate\r\n  from my usual Custom, in making all such Bravadoes sensible of their\r\n  Error, as also in giving all Spectators intire Satisfaction.\r\n\r\n  N.B. _The Doors will be open’d at Four, and the Masters mount between\r\n  Six and Seven exactly._\r\n\r\n  _VIVAT REX._\r\n\r\nSutton does not seem to have made much but hard knocks by his desire to\r\nuphold the honour of pipemakers and Kentish men, for Figg is generally\r\ncharacterised as retiring undefeated, and Captain Godfrey, the great\r\namateur of his day, makes reference to the defeat of Sutton in his\r\n“Treatise upon the Useful Science of Defence” (1747). Speaking of the\r\nOxford professor, he says: “Fig was the atlas of the sword, and may he\r\nremain the gladiating statue! In him, strength, resolution, and\r\nunparalleled judgment conspired to form a matchless master. There was a\r\nmajesty shone in his countenance, and blazed in all his actions, beyond\r\nall I ever saw. His right leg bold and firm, and his left, which could\r\nhardly ever be disturbed, gave him the surprising advantage already\r\nproved, and struck his adversary with despair and panic. He had that\r\npeculiar way of stepping in I spoke of in a parry; he knew his arm and\r\nits just time of moving, put a firm faith in that, and never let his\r\nadversary escape his parry. He was just as much a greater master than\r\nany other I ever saw, as he was a greater judge of time and measure.”\r\nOf Sutton the enthusiastic captain tells us that “he was a resolute,\r\npushing, awkward swordsman; but by his busy intruding arm, and\r\nscrambling legs, there were few judgments but what were disordered and\r\ndisconcerted. Fig managed him the best of any by his charming\r\ndistinction of time and measure, in which he far excelled all, and\r\nsufficiently proved these two be the sword’s true foundation.” Figg was\r\nalso a great bruiser, and was regarded as the champion of the boxers as\r\nwell as the master of the swordsmen. He was a genial good-tempered\r\nfellow, and was the boon companion of many eminent authors and artists\r\nof his time.\r\n\r\nSo much for show and play bills, and the celebrities to whom they have\r\nintroduced us. We will now turn to handbill and poster advertisements of\r\nvarious descriptions. Tickets and bills containing the information that\r\napartments were to be let were set up over doors at least as early as\r\n1665. In the “Pillulæ Pestilentialis” of the Rev. Richard Hingston,\r\npreacher, of St James’s, Clerkenwell, there is the following in\r\nreference to the Plague and the practice just mentioned:--\r\n\r\n    No Papers then o’er our Doors were set\r\n    With “Chambers ready furnished to be Let,”\r\n    But a sad “Lord have Mercy upon us” and\r\n    A bloody Cross as fatal Marks did stand.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a pamphlet, printed in 1673, entitled “An Essay to revive\r\nthe Ancient Education of Gentlewomen, in Religion, Manners, and\r\nTongues,” there is a postscript, containing an advertisement of a\r\nboarding school at Tottenham High Cross. This establishment was under\r\nthe management of Mrs Makin, who had been tutoress to the Princess\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Charles I., and who put forth part of her\r\nprospectus in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n  Here by the blessing of God, Gentlewomen may be instructed in the\r\n  principles of Religion, and in all manner of sober and virtuous\r\n  Education: more especially in all Things ordinarily taught in Schools\r\n  for the other Sex; as in\r\n\r\n  Works of all sorts,\r\n  Dancing,\r\n  Music,\r\n  Singing,\r\n  Writing,\r\n  Keeping Accounts.\r\n\r\n  Half the Time is to be spent in these Things, and the other half to be\r\n  employed in gaining the Latin and French Tongues, and those that\r\n  please may learn Greek and Hebrew, the Italian and Spanish; in all\r\n  which this Gentlewoman hath a competent knowledge.\r\n\r\n  Gentlewomen of eight or nine Years old, that can read well, may be\r\n  instructed in a Year or two (according to their Parts) in the Latin\r\n  and French Tongues, by plain and short Rules accommodated to the\r\n  English Tongue.\r\n\r\n  Those that will bestow a longer Time may learn the other Languages\r\n  before mentioned, if they please.\r\n\r\n  Repositories also for Visibles shall be prepared, by which from\r\n  beholding the things, Gentlewomen may learn the Names, Natures,\r\n  Values, and Uses of Herbs, Shrubs, Trees, mineral Juices, Metals and\r\n  Stones.\r\n\r\n  Those that please may learn Limning, Preserving, Pastry, and Cookery,\r\n  etc.\r\n\r\n  The rate shall be certain £20 per Annum; but if a competent\r\n  improvement be made in the Tongues, and the other Things before\r\n  mentioned, as shall be agreed upon them, something more will be\r\n  expected. But the Parents shall judge what shall be deserved by the\r\n  Undertaker.\r\n\r\nSterne, who knew as much about struggles and adversity as most people,\r\nused to tell this story about his young days: “I happened to be\r\nacquainted with a young man from Yorkshire, who rented a window in one\r\nof the paved alleys near Cornhill, for the sale of stationery. I hired\r\none of the panes of glass from my friend, and stuck up the following\r\nadvertisement with wafers:--\r\n\r\n  Epigrams, Anagrams, Paragrams, Chronograms, Monograms, Epitaphs,\r\n  Epithalamiums, Prologues, Epilogues, Madrigals, Interludes,\r\n  Advertisements, Letters, Petitions, Memorials, on every occasion,\r\n  Essays on every subject, Pamphlets for and against Ministers, Sermons\r\n  upon any Text or for any Sect, to be written here, on reasonable\r\n  terms, by\r\n\r\n  A. B. Philologer.\r\n\r\n“The uncommonness of the titles occasioned numerous applications, and at\r\nnight I used privately to glide into the office to digest the notes or\r\nheads of the day, and receive the earnest which was directed always to\r\nbe left with the memorandums, the writing to be paid for on delivery,\r\naccording to the subject.” Yorick speedily became disgusted with this\r\nemployment, however, and as soon as he possibly could retired from it.\r\n\r\nAnother of the triumphs which have unfortunately not come down to the\r\npresent generation, and which many will consider to be hardly\r\ncompensated for by gas, steam, and electricity, the postal service and\r\nthe police system, is that of Mr Nunn, whose bill, published to the\r\nworld in the latter portion of the eighteenth century, runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  _Breeches Making improved by Geometry._\r\n\r\n  _Thomas Nunn_, Breeches-Maker, No. 29, Wigmore Street, Cavendish\r\n  Square, has invented a System on a mathematical Principle, by which\r\n  Difficulties are solved, and Errors corrected; its usefulness for Ease\r\n  and Neatness in fitting is incomparable, and is the only perfect Rule\r\n  for that Work ever discovered. Several hundreds (Noblemen, Gentlemen,\r\n  and Others) who have had Proof of its Utility, allow it to excel all\r\n  they ever made Trial of.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._ An approved Method is adopted for keeping them clean without\r\n  discommoding by Dust.\r\n\r\nIn some future day, when personal comfort again becomes one of the fine\r\narts, one of the chief tests for a wranglership may be the making of\r\nmathematical breeches. If the age is very material, perhaps the approved\r\nmethod of cleaning them may stand in stead of classics, which are\r\nalready going much out of fashion. Our next specimen comes from the\r\nEmerald Isle, and though short is well marked with both of the most\r\nprominent characteristics of the natives. It was given away and posted\r\nup in various parts of Dublin at the end of July 1781:--\r\n\r\n  This is to certify that I, Daniel O’Flannaghan, am not the Person that\r\n  was tarred and feathered by the Liberty Mob, on Tuesday last; and I am\r\n  ready to give 20 Guineas to any one that will lay me 50, that I am the\r\n  other Man who goes by my Name.\r\n\r\n  Witness my Hand, this 30th July.\r\n\r\n  DANIEL O’FLANNAGHAN.\r\n\r\nA man who can afford to lay seventy guineas to thirty that he is\r\nhimself, and nobody else, deserves credit for his boldness, if not for\r\nhis ingenuity. Another bill from Ireland, of a few years later on, next\r\nclaims our attention. It refers to a house to let in Coleraine, and is a\r\nspecimen of quite another kind of Hibernian humour:--\r\n\r\n  _To be Let_\r\n\r\n  To an OPPIDAN, a RURICOLIST, or a COSMOPOLITAN, and may be\r\n  entered upon immediately.\r\n\r\n  The House in STONE ROW, lately possessed by Capt. Siree. To avoid\r\n  verbosity the proprietor with compendiosity will give a perfunctory\r\n  description of the premises, in the compagination of which he has\r\n  sedulously studied the convenience of the occupant--it is free from\r\n  opacity, tenebrosity, fumidity, and injucundity, and no building can\r\n  have greater pellucidity or translucency--in short, its diaphaneity\r\n  even in the crepuscule makes it like a pharos, and without laud, for\r\n  its agglutimation and amenity, it is a most delectable commorance; and\r\n  whoever lives in it will find that the neighbours have none of the\r\n  truculence, the immanity, the torvity, the spinosity, the putidness,\r\n  the pugnacity, nor the fugacity observable in other parts of the town;\r\n  their propinquity and consanguinity occasions jucundity and\r\n  pudicity--from which, and the redolence of the place (even in the dog\r\n  days) they are remarkable for longevity. For terms and particulars\r\n  apply to JAMES HUTCHISON, opposite the MARKET HOUSE.\r\n\r\n  _Coleraine, 30th September, 1790._\r\n\r\nWe commend this to that rather numerous class of people who like words\r\nwith plenty of sound, and regard sense as quite a secondary\r\nconsideration. Dogberry would have been delighted with it, and the\r\nwriter could have commanded his own price as a contributor to certain\r\nnewspapers, or as a sporting tipster. We have already given our readers\r\nan advertising tombstone, which was a swindle, inasmuch as it was placed\r\nup to the memory of a person who never existed. We now give another,\r\nwhich is really what it pretends to be--an improvement of the\r\nopportunity to combine business, not with pleasure, but with mourning.\r\nIt stood, we are told, in a burial-ground belonging to one of our old\r\nivy-clad churches in the North, and was an elegantly-carved memorial\r\nstone, the inscription being:--\r\n\r\n  Sacred to the Memory\r\n  of\r\n  JOHN ROBERTS,\r\n  Stonemason and Tombcutter,\r\n  Who died on Saturday, October the 8th, 1800.\r\n  N.B.--The business carried on by the Widow at No. 1, Freshfield place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HERE LYES\r\n  JEREMY JOBBINS\r\n  AN AFFECTIONATE HUSBAND\r\n  AND\r\n  A TENDER PARENT\r\n\r\n  HIS·DISCONSOLATE·WIDOW\r\n  IN·THE·HOPE·OF·A·BETTER·MEATING\r\n  CONTINUES TO\r\n  CARRY ON\r\n  THE LONG ESTABLISHED\r\n  TRIPE AND TROTTER\r\n  BUSINESS\r\n  AT·THE·SAME·PLACE\r\n  AS\r\n  BEFORE HER LAMENTED\r\n  BEREAVEMENT\r\n\r\n  READER·PAUSE·&·NOTICE THE·ADDRESS\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nPerhaps her being in the “tombstone line” may be an excuse for the widow\r\nRoberts. We don’t suppose she needed one, however, for any one who would\r\ndo what she did would be quite callous as to the world’s opinions. Of\r\nthe two we much prefer the Frenchman who erected the stone to an\r\nentirely supposititious person, to the widow who traded on her husband’s\r\ngrave. This reminds us that we have received, among many communications,\r\none containing the above sketch of an advertising tombstone, which the\r\nwriter, who dates from a well-known town in the north, Gateshead, states\r\npositively stood in a neighbouring churchyard within his recollection.\r\nThe address, he says, was on the footstone. We give the illustration\r\n“without prejudice.” Do tripe and trotters after all produce a prosaic\r\ncondition of the human mind suggested by this tombstone, or would the\r\nrelict of Jeremy have done as she did had her wares been of a different\r\nkind? In the interests of the edibles referred to, for which we must\r\nconfess a weakness, we trust she would. But who shall say?\r\n\r\nAt the time of the marriage of George the Third’s eldest daughter to the\r\nDuke of Wurtemburg, a curious little handbill was given away about\r\nLondon. It was printed on both sides, and looked like a tract. Its\r\ncontents were to the following effect:--\r\n\r\n  FRAGMENT _of a_ CHAPTER _concerning the curious_ MANGLE of BEETHAM\r\n  _appointed to be read by all the_ LADIES _and_ LAUNDRESSES _of the\r\n  land of Albion_.\r\n\r\n  _By His Majesty’s special command._\r\n\r\n  CHAP. I.\r\n\r\n  _1 Beetham’s fame and diligence. 3 his marvellous mill. 6 he\r\n  constructs a mangle which surprises the World. 8 The Princesses visit\r\n  his museum and praise the curious Machinery. 16 He is mimiced by\r\n  others. 18 The King grants his royal patent to the Artist. 22 Beetham\r\n  is recompensed by the nobles and the people._\r\n\r\n  NOW it came to pass, even towards the close of the eighteenth century,\r\n  that there lived in the great city which is called London a certain\r\n  man of the name of Beetham who had many curious inventions.\r\n\r\n  2 The same mechanic while the world waged war against _Albion_\r\n  cultivated with all diligence the arts of Peace in the ways of wisdom.\r\n\r\n  3 When therefore he saw that his washing mill pleased the people and\r\n  was daily employed by all throughout the regions of Britain and her\r\n  colonies.\r\n\r\n  4 Behold he also constructed another machine more marvellous than the\r\n  first which is called a _Mangle_ even to this day. 5 Neither adhered\r\n  he to the old gothic plan of his predecessors but formed it new and\r\n  surprising in simplicity so that a little maiden could set it in\r\n  motion.\r\n\r\n  6 And it came to pass when a great company of ladies and laundresses\r\n  beheld the infant turn the wheel with wonderful ease and moreover saw\r\n  the wheel move backwards as well as the way of the wheel whose\r\n  revolution was always the same and also saw it move as by self\r\n  instinct.\r\n\r\n  7 That they cried aloud with one voice saying, great and marvellous is\r\n  the _Mangle_ of _Beetham_.\r\n\r\n  8 And in process of time, the princesses and the nobles accompanied a\r\n  certain great prince who came from a far country to carry away a royal\r\n  beauty, even the eldest daughter of the King.\r\n\r\n  9 And behold as they passed on their way to view the wonders of the\r\n  great temple of _Paul_, one of the damsels lifted up her azure eyes\r\n  and beheld the Museum of _Beetham_ fronting the temple of _Dunstan_.\r\n\r\n  10 At that instant the child was turning the wonderful _Mill_ which\r\n  laved the fine linen clean and white in the twinkling of an eye;\r\n\r\n  11 Also another child by its feeble arm was moving the newly invented\r\n  _Mangle_.\r\n\r\n  12 And lo, one of the nobles cried, wherefore should we pass on\r\n  further into the city, let us step aside and see this miracle.\r\n\r\n  13 Now it came to pass that the company alighted from their gilded\r\n  chariots and went into the _Museum_, and marvelled much at the curious\r\n  machines.\r\n\r\n  14 And when they saw the _Mill_ and the _Mangle_, the _Wringer_ also,\r\n  and the machine for the _Churning_ of _Milk_, which even _Solomon_\r\n  with all his wisdom never invented.\r\n\r\n  15 They all with one accord commanded the master of the Museum to\r\n  prepare for the _Princess_ one of each of these curious machines; to\r\n  the end she might spread the fame of the inventor all over the land,\r\n  in which she was soon to be a sojourner.\r\n\r\n  16 ¶ Now--the _Mimic Machinists_ of those days by their enchantments\r\n  strove to surpass _Beetham_, but failed by falling into the great\r\n  _chaos_ of complication:\r\n\r\n  17 So that, like the builders of Babel they were confounded; crying\r\n  aloud, surely all machination against Beetham must fail, neither can\r\n  we imitate the simplicity of his Mangle.\r\n\r\n  18 And word was carried to the King in those days, even concerning the\r\n  new invention of the artist of London.\r\n\r\n  19 Which prevailed upon him when he also heard of the utility of the\r\n  _Mangle_ in tender kindness to all the laundresses of the land to\r\n  cause his Royal signet to be set on a certain parchment called a\r\n  patent.\r\n\r\n  20 So that until twice seven seasons should pass no man should imitate\r\n  the machine but by the consent of _Beetham_ the Proprietor thereof.\r\n\r\n  21 And when the King had so done, lo there was prepared many machines\r\n  of various sizes in order that the high and the low, the rich and the\r\n  poor, might use the same throughout the land, but Beetham was the\r\n  vender of them all.\r\n\r\n  22 And for those which the Princess and the Lords and Ladies of the\r\n  Land did cause to be sent to them which were made of Oak whose\r\n  duration shall far exceed the years of the generations of the sons of\r\n  men and which were for smoothing all the linen of the Households of\r\n  the mighty nobles, Beetham received certain pieces of money which\r\n  being counted in the coin of Albion amounted to Ten guineas.\r\n\r\n  23 And for such as were made of the wood called Beech he received nine\r\n  pieces of gold and for others eight pieces of the like coin, but for\r\n  less than eight pieces Beetham sent not the _Mangle_ forth among the\r\n  inhabitants of the land.\r\n\r\n  24 And behold all the people rejoiced extremely and the fame of the\r\n  Mangle was spread abroad among all the isles of Britain even to the\r\n  remotest part thereof; and the ships of the sea were laden with the\r\n  same machines to the Colonies abroad, and in all those parts of the\r\n  Earth where Economy is an object, where Convenience is desirable, and\r\n  where Cleanliness is esteemed next to Godliness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Mr. BEETHAM’s_\r\n  NEW PATENT PORTABLE WASHING MILL\r\n\r\n  IS so universally used and Economical, that it deserves the serious\r\n  attention of the Public in general.\r\n\r\n  1 It renders the linen whiter and cleaner than it can be made by any\r\n  other method.\r\n\r\n  2 It will wash more in one hour than ten women can in the same time.\r\n\r\n  3 It is so saving, that for Five Shillings it will wash as much as\r\n  will cost One Guinea in the common mode.\r\n\r\n  4 The price of the Mill is very soon cleared by what it saves in soap,\r\n  coals, manual labour and the preservation of the linen.\r\n\r\n  This invaluable invention may be seen from Eleven until Two every day.\r\n\r\n  A Mill large enough to wash 8 shirts 4l. 4s. 14, 4l. 14s. 6d. 18, 5l.\r\n  5s. 24, 6l. 6s.\r\n\r\n  One to first and second, 10l. 10s.

Her mother was a pupil of Opie’s, and before she married Mr\r\nReed, a solicitor, some of her pictures were exhibited as those of her\r\nmaster. She late in life became eccentric, but not to such an extent as\r\nher daughter, whose name was at one time almost a household word.\r\nAnother tradesman of the City, who was well known for his devotion to\r\nthe art of advertising, early in the present century put forth this,\r\nwhich is rather magniloquent, considering the subject which forms its\r\nbasis:--\r\n\r\n  MAY THE WINGS OF EXTRAVAGANCE _be clipped by the Scissars of\r\n  Economy_--was the constant toast of a person who knew very well the\r\n  value of a sixpence. To all good economists would Romanis wish to be\r\n  recommended, though but a bad practitioner himself, (he is a little\r\n  like the clergy--“Don’t do as I do, but as I tell you to do.”) When\r\n  you want real good Stockings at a low price, come to the Sign of the\r\n  Regent, 33 in Cheapside--there you have them in perfection, and I am\r\n  certain sixpence in a pair is worth saving; and any one that is\r\n  possest of the least spark of parsimony will give their assent.\r\n  Frugality is certainly a good thing--it enables a people to pay\r\n  taxes--to pay their armies--to thrash the French--to make peace on\r\n  good terms--to extend commerce--to make people live long and\r\n  comfortable:\r\n\r\n  FOR STOCKINGS\r\n  Romanis against the whole World, at his Mart, 33 Cheapside.\r\n\r\nFrom small beginnings great events arise--only see what benefit to the\r\nnation as well as to private individuals accrued from the purchase of\r\ncheap stockings. Romanis has never been mentioned in conjunction with\r\nWellington, yet he seems to have had a good deal to do towards building\r\nup the victory of Waterloo, and ought to have been remembered, say as\r\nmuch as Blucher, who has been immortalised in the way of boots while the\r\nstocking-seller has been clean forgotten.\r\n\r\nAnother curious advertiser was William Hall of Lynn, who flourished\r\nearly in the present century. According to Hone, Hall was a celebrated\r\nantiquarian bookseller, and received the alias of Will Will-be-So. He\r\nwas also an auctioneer, and on the market-day he would knock down his\r\nlots in great style, and with many whimsical remarks. He had a craze for\r\nverse, and in such as follows all his advertisements were written:--\r\n\r\nLYNN, 19_th_ SEPTEMBER, 1810.\r\n\r\n      First Tuesday in the next October,\r\n    Now do not doubt but we’ll be sober!\r\n    If Providence permits us action,\r\n    You may depend upon\r\n              _AN AUCTION_,\r\n                        At the stall\r\n    That’s occupied by WILLIAM HALL.\r\n\r\n    To enumerate a task would be--\r\n    The best way is to come and see;\r\n    But not to come too vague an errand,\r\n    We’ll give a sketch which we will warrant.\r\n      About _one hundred books_, in due lots,\r\n    And pretty near the same in _shoe-lasts_;\r\n    _Coats_, _waistcoats_, _breeches_, shining _buttons_,\r\n    Perhaps ten thousand _leather cuttings_,\r\n    Sold at per pound--your lot but ask it,\r\n    Shall be weighed to you in a basket;\r\n    Some lot of _tools_ to make a try on,\r\n    About one hundred-weight of _iron_;\r\n    _Scales_, _earthenware_, _arm-chairs_, a _tea-urn_,\r\n    _Tea-chests_, a _herring-tub_, and so on;\r\n    With various more that’s our intention,\r\n    Which are too tedious here to mention.\r\n      N.B.--To undeceive, ’fore you come nigher,\r\n    The duty charged upon the buyer;\r\n    And, should we find we’re not perplext,\r\n    We’ll keep it up the Tuesday next.\r\n\r\nWe have two more specimens of the English peculiar to Continentalists,\r\nthe first being of about the same period as Hall’s verse. It is an exact\r\ncopy of a card circulated by the landlord of an hotel at Ghent:--\r\n\r\n  Mr. Dewitt, in the Golden Apple, out of the Bruges Gate at Ghent, has\r\n  the honour to prevent the Persons who would come at his house, that\r\n  they shall find there always good and spacious Lodgings, a Table\r\n  served at their taste, Wine of any quality, etc. Besides he hires\r\n  Horses and Chaises, which shall be of a great conveniency for the\r\n  Travellers; the Bark of Bruges depart and arrives every day before his\r\n  door. He dares flatter himself, that they shall be satisfied, as well\r\n  with the cheapness of the price, as with the cares such an\r\n  establishment requires.\r\n\r\nThis and the next, which was given to the world in 1822, may cause\r\nEnglish people who fancy they have the most correct knowledge of French,\r\nas well as the true Parisian accent, to be a little cautious in their\r\nbelief, for there is no doubt that the authors of both notices were very\r\nstrong on their powers of “spiking the English,” as many French\r\nannouncements have it:--\r\n\r\n  M. MARLOTEAU et Cie.\r\n\r\n  _Manufacturers from Paris,_\r\n\r\n  37, MONTMORENCY-STREET,\r\n\r\n  _To London 14 Broad Street, Oxford street_.\r\n\r\n  Acquaint the Trade in general, that they have just established in\r\n  LONDON.\r\n\r\n  A Warhouse for FRENCH FLOWERS, for each Season, feathar from hat\r\n  ladies of their own Manufacture elegant fans of the NEWEST TASTE.\r\n\r\n  And of Manufactures of PARIS, complette sets ornaments for balls,\r\n  snuff boxes scale gold and silver, boxes toilette, ribbons and\r\n  embroidered, hat et cap, from Ladies of the newest Taste, China, all\r\n  sorts, etc.\r\n\r\n  He commit generally the articles from Paris, Manufacturers.\r\n\r\n  And send in all BRITISH CITY.\r\n\r\n  Attandance from Nine o’Clock in the Morning till five in the\r\n  Afternoon.\r\n\r\nBefore and during the year 1825 a man used to stand at the corner of\r\nFleet Market, and deliver handbills in the interest of a society which\r\nhad for its object the genteel and comfortable interment of its members.\r\nOne of these advertisements has been preserved, and a copy of it is\r\nappended. Its commencement is curious, and must at times have somewhat\r\ndisconcerted incautious readers, who in the midst of their business\r\ncares or pleasure pursuits suddenly had the notice of death thrust upon\r\nthem. Sir Thomas Browne, who professed to know all about mortality, says\r\nthat “man is a noble animal, splendid in ashes, and pompous in the\r\ngrave.” Whoever drew up the handbill was certainly aware of the craving\r\nwhich exists in many minds, especially among the lower orders, for a\r\ngood funeral, and made abundant provision for it. Really a _tædium vitæ_\r\nalmost creeps over one upon reading it. Who would not be willing to die,\r\nin death to be attended as is promised? Two rows all round of\r\nclose-drove best black japanned nails feelingly invite and almost\r\nirresistibly persuade us to come and be screwed down. What aching head\r\ncan resist the temptation to repose presented by the handsome crape\r\nshroud, the cap, and pillow? What sting is there in death which handles\r\nwith wrought gripes are not calculated to pluck away? What victory in\r\nthe grave which the drops and the velvet pall do not render at least\r\nextremely disputable? And, above all, a pretty emblematic plate, with\r\nthe angel above and the flower beneath, is utterly irresistible. But we\r\nin our rhapsody had forgotten to copy the bill:--\r\n\r\n  BURIAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n  A favourable opportunity now offers to any person, of either sex, who\r\n  would wish to be buried in a genteel manner, by paying one shilling\r\n  entrance, and twopence per week for the benefit of the stock. Members\r\n  to be free in six months. The money to be paid at Mr. Middleton’s at\r\n  the sign of “the First and Last,” Stonecutter Street, Fleet Market.\r\n  The deceased to be furnished as follows: a strong elm coffin, covered\r\n  with superfine black, and finished with two rows, all round, close\r\n  drove, best black japanned nails, and adorned with ornamental drops, a\r\n  handsome plate of inscription, angel above, and flower beneath, and\r\n  four pair of handsome handles, with wrought gripes; the coffin to be\r\n  well pitched, lined, and ruffled with fine crape; a handsome crape\r\n  shroud, cap, and pillow. For use, a handsome velvet pall, three\r\n  gentlemen’s cloaks, three crape hatbands, three hoods and scarfs, and\r\n  six pair of gloves; two porters equipped to attend the funeral, a man\r\n  to attend the same with band and gloves; also the burial fees paid, if\r\n  not exceeding one guinea.\r\n\r\nThe notice further informed the public, that though the society had only\r\nbeen established a very few years, upwards of eleven hundred persons had\r\nput down their names. It is worthy of remark that so many people of the\r\nindustrious classes should have clubbed their twopences to avoid what\r\nthey considered the disgrace of a parish funeral, and should doubtless\r\nhave rejoiced when their six months had expired, and they stood face to\r\nface with the handsome velvet pall and etceteras. The very poor are to\r\nthis day very particular about their funerals, and many a savoury morsel\r\nis the living body deprived of that the lifeless one may go comfortably\r\nto its last home. A labouring man’s greatest pride often is that he gave\r\nwife, parent, or child a good funeral; and this feeling is perfectly\r\nindependent of the wake peculiarities and festivities that obtain among\r\na certain section of the lower orders. Readers must be warned against an\r\nidea which they may be apt to form about the place whence these\r\nproposals issued. From the sign of the “First and Last,” they might\r\nconclude that Mr Middleton was a publican who, in assembling a club of\r\nthe above description at his house, had a view to his own interest\r\naltogether foreign to the purpose for which the society was instituted.\r\nMr Middleton was no publican, though he hung out a sign, but an honest\r\nundertaker, who also dealt in wicker ware, and who, by the exhibition of\r\nboth cradle and coffin as a device, attracted attention to which the\r\nmotto “First and Last” contributed in no small measure.\r\n\r\nThe following humorous handbill was about 1825 given away by a publican\r\nin the neighbourhood of the Strand. It is certainly a gem in its way,\r\nand shows an originality which was more likely to have been possessed by\r\none of the needy and seedy customers hanging about in the vicinity of\r\nthe theatres fifty years back, than by the well-fed, well-clad, and\r\nprobably bumptious “bung,” who ought to have made the writer free of his\r\nvarious entertainments during the long “run” they doubtless obtained if\r\nthe performance was in any way as good as the programme:--\r\n\r\n  _Licensed by Act of Parliament._\r\n  And under the immediate Patronage of the Public.\r\n  THEATRE OF EPICUREAN VARIETY\r\n  at the\r\n  KING OF PRUSSIA\r\n  Wych Street.\r\n\r\n  W. Trampton has the honor of informing his friends and the public that\r\n  his compact comfortable snug and _cosey_ little Theatre is now open\r\n  for the Winter Season; where from the well known excellence of the\r\n  company engaged he trusts to meet with a share of that encouragement\r\n  it will be his endeavour to merit and his pride to acknowledge.\r\n\r\n  A peculiar advantage attending this Theatre will no doubt be justly\r\n  appreciated by the public, namely that tickets of admission may be had\r\n  for the separate branches of the entertainment, the price of which\r\n  together with the hours of performance are specified in the following\r\n  bill:--\r\n\r\n  _During the Week the following Entertainments will be presented._\r\n\r\n  A favourite Burletta in One Act, called\r\n  SOMETHING LIKE BREAKFAST.\r\n\r\n  The chief characters by the celebrated foreign performers,\r\n  Signiors TEA COFFEE SUGAR etc.\r\n\r\n  Price of admission 10d.

A stout and venerable white-headed Porter from the office of\r\n  Messrs Goodwyn & Co. will attend the Theatre for the purpose of\r\n  keeping good order during the performance.\r\n\r\n  _The whole got up under the immediate care of_\r\n  Stage Manager _W. Trampton_.\r\n\r\nBetween forty and fifty years ago there was an amusing contest going on\r\nbetween two tradespeople in the City: both were hairdressers, and lived\r\nopposite each other. Seeing that the one throve by selling pomade made\r\nof bear’s grease, the other, knowing that it was just as good and more\r\nprofitable to sell any other material in pots with “bear’s grease” on\r\nthe label, started in opposition, using similar pots to those sold by\r\nhis opponent, filled with an inexpensive unguent. The first dealer, who\r\nwas known to keep bears in his cellar, and who had himself taken up once\r\na week before the sitting alderman as a nuisance, by way of\r\nadvertisement, killed a bear upon this, and hung him up whole in full\r\nsight in his shop. He also wrote in the window, “A fresh bear killed\r\nthis day!” The other, who had but one bear in all the world, which he\r\nprivately led out of his house after dark every night, and brought him\r\nback in the morning (to seem like a new supply going on), continued his\r\nsale, and announced in his window, “Our fresh bear will be killed\r\nto-morrow.” The original vendor then, determined to cut off his rival’s\r\nlast shift, kept his actual bears, defunct, with the skins only half\r\noff, like calves at a butcher’s, hanging up always at his door,\r\nproclaimed that “all bear’s grease sold in pots was a vile imposture,”\r\nand desired his customers to walk in “and see theirs with their own\r\neyes, cut and weighed from the animal.” This seemed conclusive for two\r\ndays; but on the third, the cunning opposition was again to the fore,\r\nwith a placard “founded on the opinion of nine doctors of physic,” which\r\nstated that bear’s grease “obtained from the animal in a tamed or\r\ndomesticated state, will not make anybody’s hair grow at all.” In\r\nconsequence of which, he went on to say, “he has formed an establishment\r\nin Russia (where all the best bears come from), for catching them wild,\r\ncutting the fat off immediately, and potting it down for London\r\nconsumption.” And the rogue actually ruined the business of his\r\nantagonist, without going to the expense of killing a single bear, by\r\nwriting all over his house, “Licensed by the Imperial Government--Here,\r\nand at Archangel.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Robins, the auctioneer, was a profound believer in the value of\r\nadvertisements, and exercised all his ingenuity and ability, both of\r\nwhich were considerable, to devise fresh schemes for attracting public\r\nnotice. His powers of producing a good bill were remarkable, as was also\r\nhis facility of description. Robins’s style has been so often commented\r\nupon, and his work so often copied and burlesqued, that it is hardly\r\nworth while our touching upon either him or his bills. As, however, such\r\na book as this would be hardly complete without a reference to the\r\npuffing genius of modern days, we select a portion--and only a portion,\r\nmind--of his description of the Colosseum in Regent’s Park, one of the\r\ngreatest failures of speculative enthusiasts known, which, despite\r\nRobins and his panegyric, and despite the strenuous efforts which have\r\nbeen made to cultivate an unwilling populace into believing in it as a\r\nplace of amusement, is now being demolished to make way for a set of\r\ndwelling-houses planned upon the site on which was reared the building\r\ndescribed by the poetically-fancied auctioneer as, among many other\r\nthings, a\r\n\r\n  =CYCLOPÆAN STRUCTURE=,\r\n\r\n  WHERE DESCRIPTION FAILS TO PORTRAY\r\n\r\n    “Its eloquent proportions,\r\n    Its mighty graduations,”\r\n\r\n  WHICH, EVEN WHEN SEEN,\r\n\r\n    “Thou seest not all, but piecemeal thou must break,\r\n    To separate contemplation, the great whole.”\r\n\r\n  THE EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS OF\r\n\r\n  =THE CLASSIC PORTICO=,\r\n\r\n  One of the finest specimens of\r\n\r\n  =THE GREEK DORIC=,\r\n\r\n  TOGETHER WITH\r\n\r\n    “The Dome, the vast and wondrous Dome,”\r\n\r\n  WHICH PROUDLY\r\n\r\n    “-----------------------------Vies\r\n    In air with earth’s chief structures,”\r\n\r\n  Win our admiration, while there is nothing of ancient or modern days\r\n  that can compete with it either in\r\n\r\n  ^Classic Elegance, Grandeur of Effect, or Beauty of Proportion;^\r\n\r\n  And it must remain to future ages a monument of the genius of the\r\n  architect, as an\r\n\r\n    “Outshining and o’erwhelming edifice.”\r\n\r\n  The stupendous purpose for which the COLOSSEUM was erected is too\r\n  well known to need description.\r\n\r\n  =THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS=\r\n\r\n  Having been attracted by\r\n\r\n  THE PICTURE OF LONDON,\r\n\r\n  Which covers the interior of the external wall,\r\n\r\n  =THE MODERN BABYLON=,\r\n\r\n  Which occupied the artist upwards of four years in delineating its\r\n  endless details from the dome of St. Paul’s at the quiet hour of\r\n  morning, when the buildings of this great metropolis were unobscured\r\n  by smoke, and the early mists dispersed by the sun’s vicegerent\r\n  power,--this picture now\r\n\r\n  “Stands within the Colosseum’s wall.”\r\n\r\n  THE BUILDING CONTAINS\r\n\r\n  =A GRAND SALOON OF ART=,\r\n\r\n  Surrounding the interior of the whole edifice,\r\n\r\n    “All musical in its immensities,\r\n    Rich marbles--richer painting--”\r\n\r\n  Stored with productions of modern artists, models of ingenious\r\n  machinery, and a variety of scientific experiments to attract the\r\n  spectator, and is well calculated for any and every exhibition of an\r\n  extensive nature.\r\n\r\n    “Enter--------------thy mind,\r\n    Expanded by the genius of the spot,\r\n    Has grown colossal!”\r\n\r\n  On the outside of the main building are magnificent Conservatories\r\n  filled with every kind of exotic, and decorated with\r\n\r\n  _FOUNTAINS AND JETS D’EAU_,\r\n\r\n  Equalling in beauty the most celebrated\r\n\r\n  ^Fountains of Versailles & St. Eldefonso^.\r\n\r\n  =Two Thousand Eight Hundred Persons=\r\n\r\n  HAVE PAID FOR ADMISSION DURING ONE DAY\r\n\r\n  To view this extraordinary and incomparable work of art.\r\n\r\n  =THE COLOSSEUM’S GRANDEUR=\r\n\r\n  ENCOMPASSED THEM WITH WONDER--A SUBLIME\r\n  CREATIVE SPIRIT IN THIS WORLD OF MIRACLES.\r\n\r\n  It may be well to observe that continued success will be rendered\r\n  certain by a change of scene, and the purchaser has\r\n  only to call to his aid\r\n\r\n  =THE MAGIC INFLUENCE OF STANFIELD’S PENCIL=\r\n\r\n  To create a new sensation, and enlist thousands to partake of the\r\n  refreshing delight created by his versatile and unrivalled talent.\r\n  Indeed, it will not be requisite to tax ingenuity very greatly to\r\n  think of an infinite variety of ways by which a large fortune may be\r\n  made. It has for years past produced from\r\n\r\n  =Three to Five Thousand Pounds a Year=,\r\n\r\n  And this without any artificial aid, or so much of industry and tact\r\n  as this wonderful building seems especially to have invited.\r\n\r\nRobins’s eloquence very often led him to describe things as they were\r\nnot, and now and again he had to recant and make amends. He is generally\r\ncredited with having referred to a gallows which stood upon part of an\r\nestate, as a unique and elegant hanging wood, and thereby obtaining a\r\nconsiderably larger sum for the property than it was in any way worth.\r\nAmong Robins’s many eccentricities this must not be reckoned, as the\r\nhanging-wood episode, though true in itself, belongs to an earlier time,\r\nthe trick having been played during the last century. When a man gets\r\ncredit for the possession of any peculiarity, every story that can be\r\nraked up of a suitable kind takes him for its originator or leading\r\nspirit, and innumerable tales were at one time current with regard to\r\nthe great auctioneer, of which he was perfectly innocent. So it is in\r\nother things. What did Foote, Garrick, Sheridan, Hook, Sydney Smith,\r\nHood, Barham, Rogers, Jerrold, and numerous other of our celebrated\r\nwits, know of a quarter the sayings and doings that have been ascribed\r\nto them? Little indeed, we fancy. But there are some things which Robins\r\ndid say and do which have not been recorded. In answer to a lady who\r\nremarked to him that in his graphic descriptions he must have used up\r\nthe entire dictionary, Robins said, “Madam, I’ll give five pounds to any\r\ncharitable society you like to name if you can find me a word I have not\r\nused.” Mrs Macauley might have taken him at his word, and would\r\ndoubtless have won the money, but the lady we speak of declined the\r\ncontest. There is not much in this, except as showing to what an extent\r\nhis powers of description led him. Having given one of his sayings, we\r\nwill conclude with an item from his doings, a description of the villa\r\nand garden of W. Harrison, Esq., Q.C. We trust we shall cause no one to\r\nbe discontented with his or her present abode by giving this\r\ndescription--rather do we hope that one of the new race of picturesque\r\nreporters may be tempted by it to study under Robins, and thereby\r\nimprove his condition:--\r\n\r\n  In attempting an adequate representation of what has been aptly\r\n  termed\r\n  =A LITTLE HEAVEN UPON EARTH=,\r\n\r\n  Much of the difficulty Mr. ROBINS feared to encounter he is happily\r\n  relieved from by the extraordinary renown which the late worthy\r\n  possessor has imparted to this incomparable retreat.\r\n\r\n    “Thus far we sail before the wind,”\r\n\r\n  Exclaims the individual who is flattered by having been selected for\r\n  this interesting Sale, but fear and trembling now succeeds in\r\n  encountering the Herculean task of pourtraying the countless beauties\r\n  that are congregated\r\n\r\n  =Within the Grounds of this Elysium=.\r\n\r\n  It would puzzle much higher talent than he can bring, adequately to\r\n  describe this Landscape, but it must be attempted; and Mr. ROBINS\r\n  prays that the reader will bear with him a little longer, under the\r\n  assurance that condensity shall be his motto, at the same time\r\n  avoiding that cloudy region entered by the witty Flaccus, who,\r\n\r\n    “Aiming at brevity became obscure.”\r\n\r\n  _THE GROUNDS_\r\n\r\n  Extend to near Five Acres, and the extraordinary tact that must have\r\n  presided in arriving at this scene of perfection, must be viewed, it\r\n  must be seen to feel and appreciate what seems to partake of Fairy\r\n  Land. Mr. LOUDON has indulged the public with Twenty-two Vignettes and\r\n  Plans to hand down to posterity a faint idea of\r\n\r\n  =The Velvet Ornamental lawn=,\r\n\r\n  On which is congregated the most rare and extensive assemblage of\r\n  Plants and flowering Shrubs that is to be met with in England.\r\n\r\n  From all\r\n\r\n  THE FLORICULTURAL EXHIBITIONS\r\n\r\n  The treasures were quite sure to find a home at Cheshunt, indeed the\r\n  late Proprietor’s judgment in the Cultivation of Rare and Valuable\r\n  Plants was quite unique, and his Gardener, Mr. PRATT, a prototype of\r\n  his employer. It would fatigue the reader to give in detail the host\r\n  of Rare Plants that adorn these Grounds, the value of which is past\r\n  belief--more than a Thousand Pounds have been consumed alone in rare\r\n  Exotics; the masses of Growing Plants, the French Garden, and all this\r\n  (by the way) is relieved and varied by\r\n\r\n  =THE ORNAMENTAL WATERS AND ISLAND=,\r\n\r\n  Varying and necessarily improving this beauteous scene. Perpetual\r\n  breaks and peeps are contrived, by different views, to look on the\r\n  Waters, in which Thousands of Gold and Silver Fish enjoy their\r\n  “sportive gambols.” Correct judgment is made very manifest in the\r\n  disposition of these Grounds, by avoiding the whole being seen, except\r\n  by slow degrees. Then there are dispersedly dotted about throughout\r\n  the Lawn--The Rustic Alcoves, the Chinese Temple, Grottos, and covered\r\n  Seats, Orchidaceus and Fern Houses, and Aviary.\r\n\r\n  A Mount is devoted to the Show of Aloes during the Summer, rendering\r\n  the _ensemble_ most captivating; a Hermit’s Cave, covered with Ivy; a\r\n  Gravel Walk, belted by American Borders of Rare Plants; a beautiful\r\n  Grotto, adorned by a fine piece of Statuary; a Rustic Summer House,\r\n  fitted up in the Indian style; a smaller Grotto, fitted in Stone, of\r\n  grotesque and rustic masonry; in fact, everything that sagacity or the\r\n  human mind could well conceive, seems to have been achieved here, to\r\n  render this spot\r\n\r\n  =A PERFECT PARADISE.=\r\n\r\n  From the Terrace Walk that environs it, a perpetually interesting\r\n  scene of the Lawn, in varied forms of beauty (the Church Steeple\r\n  peeping out in the distance, to vary the scene) is disclosed, and is\r\n  so ingeniously and cleverly managed that the deciduous Trees, during\r\n  the Summer, afford constant protection from the heat of the sun, and\r\n  during the Winter (being then naked) admit the genial warmth of the\r\n  sun to keep dry the Gravel Walks.\r\n\r\nFrom the canny North Country we get two bills, the first of which is\r\nlikely to shake the belief of those who imagine that swindlers and\r\nimpostors have little chance in the border counties, where the babies\r\nare said to be born with their wisdom teeth ready cut, and to “know\r\ntheir way about” before they are out of leading-strings.

A. was fully\r\npossessed of his share of artfulness, and though his name has not come\r\ndown to us, it being just the same in the bill as here printed, his\r\ninitials were well known some years back, and his practice was very\r\nsuccessful:--\r\n\r\n  THE WHOLE ART OF FORTUNE-TELLING,\r\n  BY J----n A----k, BARTON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Deep in the dismal Regions, void of Light,\r\n    Three Witches, for Consultation, meet to Night;\r\n    So, sacred Sisters, your secret Mysteries state,\r\n    The Witches leaders, and their great Powers relate._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  WHO begs most respectfully to acquaint his Friends that he has, for\r\n  the Benefit of the Public, commenced the above Business; and, from the\r\n  long Time he had studied under the different Masters of the Magical\r\n  Mysteries in the present Age, also, in all the ancient and modern\r\n  Books, in Astrology, Nicromancy, Divinations, and all the magical\r\n  Charms, Spells, Rites, Enchantments, and hidden Mysteries in past and\r\n  future Events, flatters himself that he has become Proficient in his\r\n  Art.\r\n\r\n    Hail, Medea, hail! if still he scorn the Spell,\r\n    By Fate, I’ll force him to the Gates of Hell!\r\n    Such potent Sorceries an Assyrian taught,\r\n    As to a magic Charm the Drugs he wrought.\r\n\r\n  J.

It is\r\na pity J. A. did not get some of his mysterious agents to put his lines\r\na little in order. The other is a Tyneside advertisement, and shows also\r\na partiality for verse--indeed consists of nothing else, if we except\r\nthe name and address; but its theme is far more material than that of\r\nits companion. Unlike in the case of the publican of Wych Street, we\r\nwill not assume that Mr Catcheside employed any one over the following\r\neffusion, of which he is welcome to all the credit:--\r\n\r\n  JOHN CATCHESIDE,\r\n  GROCER & TEA-DEALER,\r\n  BIGG-MARKET,\r\n  _NEWCASTLE_.\r\n\r\n    YE gentlemen of town and country,\r\n    A shop, next door to Whitfield’s entry,\r\n    Is just fit up for your inspection,\r\n    By Mr Catcheside’s direction;\r\n    Good ladies, too, I crave your favours,--\r\n    To please you shall be my endeavours.\r\n    Without the fairer sex are pleas’d,\r\n    The mind of man is never eas’d.\r\n    But ladies, pray, and gentlemen,\r\n    Call, and I’ll please you if I can.\r\n    I’ve Teas of all sorts you can mention--\r\n    To keep them good is my intention:\r\n    All from the India-house direct,\r\n    Warranted genuine you may expect;\r\n    Which I do sell on lowest terms,\r\n    And not as gentlemen let farms;\r\n    I’ve Sugars too, the same to sweeten,\r\n    As good as ever yet were eaten;\r\n    Loaves, well refin’d as ’ere you saw,\r\n    Which boiling water scarce will thaw.\r\n    I’ve Treacle, Juice, and Sugar-Candy,\r\n    And Turkey Coffee strong as brandy;\r\n    The very best Plantation ditto,\r\n    With Fry’s and White’s best Patent Cocoa,\r\n    And Churchman’s Patent Chocolate,--\r\n    All which I sell at a low rate.\r\n    I’ve fine Tobacco, Patent Shag,\r\n    Twist, Saffron Cut, and Common Rag;\r\n    And Snuff, whatever kind you choose,\r\n    To clear your brain, and warm your nose;\r\n    Zant Currants, commonly call’d Spice,\r\n    Orange and Lemon Peel, and Rice;\r\n    Malaga Raisins, too, I sell,\r\n    With Bloom, and Sun, and Muscatell,\r\n    With which you well may stuff your wigs;\r\n    Or here’s French Plumbs, or Turkey Figs;\r\n    Or Prunes, if you do think them fitter,\r\n    With Almonds, Jordan, Shell, and Bitter;\r\n    Nutmegs, Cloves, Cinnamon, and Mace,\r\n    Good as you’ll get at any place;\r\n    Season your syllabubs and custards;\r\n    For beef, I’ve Vinegar and Mustards.\r\n    All kinds of Pepper, too, I’ll sell ye,\r\n    Macaroni and Vermacelli;\r\n    Anchovies, Cassia, and Cassia-buds,\r\n    And many other sorts of goods,\r\n    Prepar’d for puddings, pies, and sauces:--\r\n    Come, buy them cheap, ye bonny lasses!\r\n    And if your birds for seeds do gape,\r\n    I have Canary, Hemp, and Rape;\r\n    And further down you need not wander\r\n    For Annis, Carraway, and Coriander;\r\n    Of Ginger, too, I’m never scant,\r\n    For any purpose you may want.\r\n    I’ve Sago fine, and Capers both,\r\n    And famous Barley for your broth!\r\n    Salt Petre, Bay and Basket Salt,\r\n    To make your hams without a fault;\r\n    With Picked Isinglass and Staple,\r\n    To make your ale fit for the table:--\r\n    Then what can man desire more,\r\n    Than beef, and broth, and ale in store?\r\n    But dinner’s done; come, draw the table,\r\n    Here’s Soap to wash while you are able;\r\n    But if you think that will not do,\r\n    Here’s Poland Starch and Powder Blue;\r\n    And if you’d have some coarser washes,\r\n    I have good Pearl and Comby Ashes;\r\n    Should you incline to wash by night,\r\n    I’ve Candles, too, will shew you light.\r\n    To spin dry wool you need not toil,\r\n    I’ve plenty Whale and Florence Oil.\r\n    Set by your wheels, your tongs, and poker\r\n    And paint your nooks with Yellow Ochre.\r\n    Put all your dye-pots to one side,\r\n    When with fresh Indigo supplied;\r\n    Then paint above your lintel-head\r\n    And chimney-pieces with Black-Lead.\r\n    If still materials you do lack,\r\n    I’ve Fuller’s Earth and Ivory Black,\r\n    Logwood, Copperas, and Whiting,\r\n    Yea many more things not worth writing.\r\n    Once more your favours I solicit,\r\n    I’m ready waiting for a visit;\r\n    Most due attendance will be given\r\n    From seven at morn till eight at even;\r\n    Or later, if it seems expedient,\r\n    By your most humble and obedient,\r\n\r\n  JOHN CATCHESIDE.\r\n\r\nGetting back to London, we come upon a bill of the kind now and then\r\nadopted with regard to posters, the idea in which is to convey a\r\ndifferent notion at sight from that which is given by close inspection.\r\nIn the following the plan has been carried out with great nicety, the\r\nauthor’s endeavour being to make the notice look like a Government\r\nproclamation, and as one of the best specimens of the kind we have ever\r\nseen it is presented to the reader:--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: V.

If its promoters\r\nreceived any extra support because of it, they certainly deserved what\r\nthey got, as the plan is difficult to connect with any but large bills.\r\nThe next item we have brings us to the year 1853, and is again from the\r\ncounty of Northumberland. It is far more pretentious than the\r\ncomposition of Mr John Catcheside, but by no means so successful. It is\r\nfrom the pen of a general shopkeeper, who evidently considered he had\r\ndone something when he had been through his proofs, seen this to press,\r\nand forwarded copies to unsuspecting, and, as it turned out,\r\nunsympathising, families about G----, a small place not very far from\r\nNewcastle:--\r\n\r\n  _To the inhabitants of G---- and its neighbourhood._\r\n\r\n  The present age is teeming with advantages which no preceding era in\r\n  the history of mankind has afforded to the human family. New schemes\r\n  are projecting to enlighten and extend civilisation, Railways have\r\n  been projected and carried out by an enterprising and spirited nation,\r\n  while Science in its gigantic power (simple yet sublime) affords to\r\n  the human mind so many facilities to explore its rich resources, the\r\n  Seasons roll on in their usual course producing light and heat, the\r\n  vivifying rays of the sun and the fructifying influences of nature\r\n  producing food and happiness to the Sons of Toil, while to the people\r\n  of G---- and its neighbourhood a rich and extensive variety of\r\n  Fashionable Goods is to be found in my Warehouse, which have just been\r\n  selected with the greatest care. The earliest visit is requested to\r\n  convey to the mind an adequate idea of the great extent of his\r\n  purchases, comprising, as it does, all that is elegant and useful,\r\n  cheap and substantial to the light-hearted votaries of Matrimony, the\r\n  Matrons of Reflection, the Man of Industry, and the Disconsolate\r\n  Victims of Bereavement.\r\n\r\nThis composition having been printed and distributed, the author waited\r\nimpatiently for its powerful effect, and when to his great astonishment\r\nhe discovered that it had produced none, he, with the irritability that\r\nnearly always accompanies neglected genius, resolved to get back and\r\ndestroy every copy of his essay, and thereby deny to posterity what his\r\nown generation could not appreciate. Fortunately for ourselves, and for\r\nages yet unborn, a copy was preserved, and printed in _Notes and\r\nQueries_.\r\n\r\nMost dwellers for any time in London remember Lord Chief Baron Nicholson\r\nand his Judge and Jury Society, which used to be held at the Coal Hole\r\nin the Strand. Virtuous readers may shudder at the mention of such a\r\nplace; but time was when the deliberations and decisions of the jury, as\r\nwell as the directions of the judge and the peculiarities of the\r\nwitnesses, were productive of mirth independent of _double entendre_\r\namong an audience composed of anything but roysterers and howling cads.\r\nIn such halcyon days, when Nicholson was in the flesh, looking much more\r\nlike a chief baron than nine-tenths of the possessors of the title ever\r\ndid, the following handbill was printed:--\r\n\r\n  The Lord Chief Baron\r\n\r\n  NICHOLSON\r\n\r\n  Begs to inform his best friends, the Public, that he and the learned\r\n  Gentlemen of the JUDGE AND JURY SOCIETY, have left the Garrick’s Head\r\n  in Bow Street, and now hold their Forensic Sittings at the celebrated\r\n  COAL HOLE TAVERN, Fountain Court, Strand, every Evening.\r\n\r\n    A JUDGE!--and in a Coal Hole too!\r\n      Quoth rustic John, I can’t believe thee.\r\n    That sounds too funny to be true,\r\n      Come NICHOLSON, now don’t deceive me.\r\n\r\n    I wont deceive thee in the path,\r\n      So at the ancient Coal Hole meet me,\r\n    BLACKSTONE and COKE burn on the hearth,\r\n      And LAW flares up, my lad, to greet thee.\r\n\r\n  DO NOT FORGET TO REMEMBER\r\n  THE COAL HOLE\r\n  IN THE STRAND.\r\n\r\nLaw was the proprietor of the establishment, and he “flared up” to some\r\ntune, so far as the production of suppers required flaring. And suppers\r\nwere both numerous and excellent at the Coal Hole; the stewed or\r\nscalloped oyster, the devilled kidney, the broiled bone, and the modest\r\n“rabbit” receiving considerable attention during the progress of the\r\nmock trials. Subsequently the Coal Hole became a resort for journalists\r\nand actors, who used to be admitted to a snug old room behind the bar;\r\nbut all that is changed now, an ambitious landlord having modernised the\r\nplace and driven forth its old _habitués_. Not by violence or through\r\nincivility, but by means of plate-glass, electro tankards, and other\r\ngoods, the unwonted and unwelcome aspect of which has made wanderers of\r\nthe old warm-hearted coterie. Why will people “restore” and improve the\r\nfew comfortable old taverns still left about London, and drive honest\r\nfolk from the snug and unpretending corners they have occupied for\r\nyears? This same restoration is shortsighted and impolitic. The houses\r\nbecome nondescript; they are too modern, and perhaps too respectable,\r\nfor the old customers, not glaring and gassy enough for the new; and so\r\nthey stand, with just sufficient about them to remind us of the joys\r\nthat are past, and not enough to tempt us to renew them in the future.\r\n\r\nTurning from taverns, coal-holey and otherwise, we have finally to\r\nnotice that kind of advertising which is the result of an attempt to\r\nmake profit out of others’ misfortunes. At the time, but a very few\r\nyears back, of the Overend and Gurney failure, an enterprising\r\nlinen-draper in the North-West district of London put forth the\r\nfollowing handbill (p. 555), which was of large size, surrounded by a\r\nthick black mourning border, and which, in addition to being given away,\r\nwas sent about by post. For reasons which are obvious, we have changed\r\nthe names, and have no hesitation in giving an opinion that the\r\nproceeding was a very sharp bit of business, worthy of the hero of the\r\nwooden nutmegs.\r\n\r\nIt was followed by a long list of the goods to be sold, with the market\r\nprices and those at which they were offered, the practice of making up\r\ntwo sets of figures on goods having been found very efficacious of late\r\nyears. This brings us well up to the present time, and as that is quite\r\ncapable of taking care of itself without any assistance from us, we will\r\nconclude, in the hope that, though we have perforce passed many\r\ninteresting specimens by, our selection, considering the space at\r\ncommand, has not been in any way injudicious.\r\n\r\n  The Overend Gurney & Co. Disaster.\r\n\r\n  LAMENTABLE CASE OF RUIN AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n  =THE “STANDARD” of the 29th ultimo, truly observes--=\r\n\r\n  “=Difficult indeed would it be to exaggerate the extent of the\r\n  mischief that was done by the fall of the great house which had for\r\n  generations stood firm as a rock *  *  *  * nor would it be easy to\r\n  adequately describe the woe and desolation, the loss and ruin,\r\n  consequent upon the suspension and disastrous liquidation of the\r\n  Company.=”\r\n\r\n  A more distressing case than the one in question it is impossible to\r\n  conceive.--It is briefly told.--An old-established Linen Draper of the\r\n  City of London, (Mr. JOB HUCKABACK), had invested the Savings of a\r\n  life-time in the Overend Gurney Scheme. The result is known. Still his\r\n  Business remained, and he might have struggled on, but further calls\r\n  being imminent, his last hope was crushed, so, Bankrupt and\r\n  broken-hearted, he died,--leaving a wife and five young children to\r\n  the mercy of fate.--\r\n\r\n  The Trade Creditors have done what they can by waiving all claims upon\r\n  the Estate, and have generously resolved that the Stock shall be sold\r\n  for the benefit of the Widow and Children.\r\n\r\n  THE STOCK, WHICH IS HIGHLY CHOICE AND\r\n  VALUABLE, HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED TO\r\n\r\n  =MR. CHARLES MARTEL=,\r\n\r\n  With prompt Orders TO REALISE AT ONCE ON\r\n  ANY TERMS.\r\n\r\n  THE FIRST GRAND SALE OF SELECTED GOODS WILL BE\r\n  HELD IN THE\r\n  Large Assembly Room of the ---- Hotel, N.W.\r\n  (☞ Ladies may avoid passing through the Hotel, by presenting\r\n  enclosed Card to Messenger at Private Door.)\r\n\r\n  On Monday, 1st, Tuesday, 2nd, Wednesday, 3rd,\r\n  and Thursday, 4th March,\r\n  From Ten a.m. till Dusk each Day, closing on Thursday, at 5 p.m.,\r\n  prompt, _not a minute later_.\r\n\r\n  The Sale will be by Private Treaty, thus affording Ladies leisure to\r\n  freely inspect.

So that\r\nperhaps, after all, the broader view is our modern view; for it is, or\r\ncertainly should be, the improved view. In course of time the American\r\npress may adopt the plan now in use here so far as regards all the\r\npapers which we consider representative, that of having an outward and\r\nvisible show of decency in the advertisement columns, no matter what\r\ndarkness or danger lurks beneath. With very few exceptions, the papers\r\nwhich come from the United States--we refer not to the hole-and-corner\r\nbut to the high-class, which are widely read and disseminated among\r\nfamily circles--contain advertisements which would be rejected by the\r\ngutter journals of this country. A hundred years ago, as we have said\r\nand instanced, our papers were not at all particular, so long as they\r\ncould get advertisements, what they took; now a sense of what is right\r\nand proper compels them to refuse many notices which would be highly\r\npaid for--would be paid any price for--and in time the American press\r\nwill doubtless follow the self-abnegating example. The broadened view we\r\nthink, therefore, is ours, yet our style is often referred to as\r\nnarrow-minded. The narrow mind is that which sacrifices its honour and\r\ncredit in its greed for immediate profit and hunger after the almighty\r\ndollar.\r\n\r\nFor many reasons there is a great difficulty in dealing with American\r\nadvertisements. Sometimes they are too long for quotation, at other\r\ntimes they are too broad; and very often one is not quite sure whether\r\nor not it is a really _bona fide_ advertisement he is reading, or only\r\nan expression of gratitude from an editor for the favours he has\r\nreceived or fondly anticipates. American editors have peculiar notions\r\non the subject of advertisements and the duties of advertisers. In a New\r\nYork journal which boldly announces itself as the American Gentleman’s\r\nNewspaper, there is, or used to be, an editorial notice which informs\r\nall whom it most concerns, that, so as to meet the requirements of the\r\nfamily circle, and so that the paper may be left upon every gentleman’s\r\nbreakfast-table, the use of the name of the Deity is expressly forbidden\r\nin the advertising or other columns. We quote from memory, but if these\r\nare not the exact words, the line of argument--if argument such a _non\r\nsequitur_ can be called--is identical with that used by Mr Wilkes, the\r\nproprietor and editor of this model and gentlemanly paper. It would be\r\nwell, however, if the American lady’s newspaper erred in no greater\r\nparticular than the American gentleman’s does. For the honour of America\r\nit is to be sincerely hoped that its ladies know nothing of the sheets\r\nwhich are flaunted here with the names of women as the editors, and\r\nwhich are said to be written especially for women. It is hard to believe\r\nthat any sane creature, much more a woman, could write such festering\r\nscurrility, such fatuous blasphemy, and such shameless indecency and\r\nadvocacy of open adultery as appear in the columns of one at least of\r\nthese women’s journals; but it is easy to imagine that a few besotted\r\nfemales, suffering from erotic and other dementia, should exhibit\r\nthemselves to the scornful gaze of the virtuous or the only moderately\r\nvicious for the purpose of obtaining notoriety--far easier than to\r\nbelieve that the women of America are the readers of and subscribers to\r\nthese papers and their opinions. We are quite sure that no woman worthy\r\nof the name would look a second time at the organ of Victoria C.\r\nWoodhull and Tennie C. Claflin--quite as sure as that the two persons we\r\nhave named are, with their followers, quite unfit to be regarded as\r\nwomen. We have referred to this paper and its “editors” because it and\r\nthey represent a class of journals and journalists which are,\r\nunfortunately for Americans, too apt to be taken as standard\r\nrepresentatives of the type, and from no desire to accord them the\r\nspurious celebrity they so anxiously covet.\r\n\r\nStill, without wishing to impute anything like iniquity to American\r\nnewspapers generally, it must be admitted that the vast majority of them\r\nhave rather lax notions of propriety, and their motto being “Get money,”\r\nthey are apt to ignore the existence of ill in any advertisement,\r\nprovided the presenter of it has his “pile” ready, and will “come down\r\nhandsome.” This is evident throughout the whole of the transatlantic\r\nnews world; and though there are, we feel bound and are glad to admit,\r\nvery honourable exceptions, they are but the exceptions which prove the\r\nrule. As the editors and proprietors generally accuse each other, they\r\ncannot feel annoyed if we, standing afar off, make our notes according\r\nto what they give us. If they prefer to feel angry, however, we shall\r\nnot stand in their way; but doubtless the majority are too intent on\r\ngetting money to care much for what is said about them. Indeed there are\r\nmany who exult in the notion of making capital by all kinds of\r\nadvertisements, from the puff preliminary to the nauseating display of\r\nvile quackery or undisguised immorality, and vary this with agreeable\r\nlittle interludes in the way of black-mail. In several American\r\nnewspapers open and undisguised announcements have been published that\r\ntheir columns are to be bought, and that for a price they will advocate\r\nany cause or take any side of a disputed question.\r\n\r\nBut throughout all this there is a great spice of humour, and in the\r\ngeneral run of American advertisements it is much to be feared, and only\r\nnatural to assume, that a stricter code of morality would result in a\r\nvast increase of dulness, the general concomitant of prim\r\nrespectability. Yet it is possible to be wise as well as witty, and even\r\nnow a good percentage of American advertisers prove this. From these we\r\nshall endeavour to select our stock, and so give all the humour without\r\nintruding the unpleasantness, except where it is absolutely necessary\r\nfor the purpose of giving a fair idea of the American system. A good\r\ninstance of ingenuity is that of the grocer in Pennsylvania, who on the\r\nfence of a graveyard inscribed in large white letters, “Use Jones’s\r\nbottled ale if you would keep out of here.” Grave subjects are often\r\nchosen as opportunities for advertising, one thing frequently offered\r\nbeing “Port wine as pure as the tears which fall upon a sister’s grave.”\r\nA firm engaged in the “statuary line” state that “those who buy\r\ntombstones of us look with pride and satisfaction upon the graves of\r\ntheir friends;” and from a large upholstery establishment the following\r\nemanates:--\r\n\r\n    Their parlor furniture is elegant,\r\n    Their bedroom furniture is rich,\r\n    Their mattresses are downy,\r\n    Their coffins are comfortable.\r\n\r\nThere is, after all, not much opportunity for the display of novelty in\r\nadvertisements nowadays; but a merchant in Newark, New York State,\r\nsucceeded very well by leaving his column entirely blank with the\r\nexception of this note, in very small type, at the bottom: “This space\r\nwas sold to A. E. Brennan and Co., but as their business is\r\nsufficiently brisk already they decline to use it.” This anecdote in its\r\nprogress has been related of most large houses in or about New York and\r\nBoston, but Brennan was the man who gave rise to it. Quite as\r\nbusiness-like, and rather more cynical, was the Ohio tradesman who, in\r\nlarge print, gave the following forth: “Ministers of the Gospel supplied\r\nwith goods at cost, if they agree to mention the fact to their\r\ncongregations.” And though the next is a purely private communication,\r\nthe author of it was evidently a born advertiser: “If the party who took\r\na fancy to my overcoat was influenced by the inclemency of the weather,\r\nall right; but if by commercial considerations, I am ready to negotiate\r\nfor its return.” In an advertisement headed “Full-dress funeral,” which\r\nappears in a Philadelphia paper, is the intimation that “all the\r\ngentlemen friends of the late Mr Smith desirous of participating in the\r\nfuneral will appear in full-dress suit and white gloves at Happy Hall,\r\nat nine o’clock a.m. on Friday morning, Jan. 29, and proceed from thence\r\nin a body to the house of the deceased.” This peculiarity of a.m. in the\r\nmorning reminds us of the announcement on a bridge at Denver, Colorado,\r\nwhich states that “no vehicle drawn by more than one animal is allowed\r\nto cross this bridge in opposite directions at the same time;” though\r\nour intention, while touching on funerals, was to give the subjoined\r\nletter from an enterprising undertaker in Illinois to a sick man: “Dear\r\nsir, having positive proof that you are rapidly approaching Death’s\r\ngate, I have, therefore, thought it not imprudent to call your attention\r\nto the inclosed advertisement of my abundant stock of ready-made\r\ncoffins, and desire to make the suggestion that you signify to your\r\nfriends a wish for the purchase of your burial outfit at my\r\nestablishment.” And thereon followed an elaborate list of the essentials\r\nto a first-class funeral, the reader having nothing to do but to supply\r\nthe corpse. Apropos of supply, the following from a Chicago\r\nconfectioner’s notice is worthy of remark: “Families supplied by the\r\nquart or gallon.” This ostensibly refers to olives, but to us it seems\r\nvery suggestive of olive branches. Occasionally, in running through the\r\npapers, one is surprised at the appetite of a lady who wants “to take a\r\ngentleman for breakfast and tea;” at the single-mindedness of a\r\nboarding-house keeper who advertises that “single gentlemen are\r\nfurnished with pleasant rooms, also one or two gentlemen with wives;” or\r\nthe boldness of a merchant who, in a free country, openly gives notice\r\nthat there is “wanted--a woman to sell on commission.”\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the “editorials” which have a more or less\r\nremote connection with advertisements, and now select two examples with\r\nwhich to illustrate our meaning. They are of very opposite characters,\r\nand will serve to give both extremes, between which all sorts of puffs\r\nmay find classification. The first is very common. Says the editor of a\r\nYankee paper:--\r\n\r\n  A correspondent wants to know what kind of a broom the young lady in\r\n  the novel used when she swept back the ringlets from her classic brow.\r\n  We don’t know, and shouldn’t answer if we did. We only undertake to\r\n  answer queries of a practical and useful character. If our\r\n  correspondent, who we presume is a gentleman, had asked who was the\r\n  best and most popular hatter in the city, we would have promptly and\r\n  unhesitatingly answered, James H. Chard of Broadwalk.\r\n\r\nThis tradesman had evidently supplied, or promised to supply, a new\r\ncovering for the editorial head, with perhaps a little light refreshment\r\nas well. The other specimen is far more deliberate, and at the same time\r\nmore respectable. It is from a Buffalo paper of half-a-dozen years back,\r\nand is not at all unlike the very earliest advertisement recommendations\r\nof our own country:--\r\n\r\n  We are assured that the firm of Eastman & Kendall, 65, Hanover Street,\r\n  Boston, Mass., advertised in our columns, is trustworthy and\r\n  reliable. For 10 cents they send a patent pen fountain and a check\r\n  describing an article to be sold for $1. Their club system of selling\r\n  goods is becoming quite popular, particularly with the ladies. It is\r\n  worthy of a trial.\r\n\r\nTwo specimens of editorial personal advertisements will doubtless\r\nsuffice. One was published by an Illinois journalist on assuming the\r\nduties of chief of the staff, and it gives a very good idea of the plan\r\nupon which he intended to “run” his paper. It says:--\r\n\r\n  Sensational, distressing details of revolting murders and shocking\r\n  suicides respectfully solicited. Bible class presentations and\r\n  ministerial donation parties will be “done” with promptness and\r\n  despatch. Keno banks and their operations made a speciality. Accurate\r\n  reports of Sunday School anniversaries guaranteed. The local editor\r\n  will cheerfully walk 17 miles after Sunday school to see and report a\r\n  prize fight. Funerals and all other melancholy occasions written up in\r\n  a manner to challenge admiration. Horse races reported in the highest\r\n  style of the reportorial art. Domestic broils and conjugal felicities\r\n  sought for with untiring avidity. Police court proceedings and sermons\r\n  reported in a manner well calculated to astonish the prisoner,\r\n  magistrate, and preacher.\r\n\r\nThe other is the opposite of the foregoing, and was penned under very\r\ndifferent circumstances. It is from a Keithsburg journal, and first saw\r\nthe light under the head reserved for notices of deaths:--\r\n\r\n  About two and a-half years ago we took possession of this paper. It\r\n  was then in the very act of pegging out, having neither friends,\r\n  money, nor credit. We tried to breathe into it the breath of life; we\r\n  put into it all our own money and everybody else’s we could get hold\r\n  of; but it was no go; either the people of Keithsburg don’t appreciate\r\n  our efforts, or we don’t know how to run a paper. We went into the\r\n  business with confidence, determined to run it or burst. We have\r\n  busted. During our connection with the _Observer_ we have made some\r\n  friends and numerous enemies. The former will have our gratitude while\r\n  life lasts. The latter are affectionately requested to go to the\r\n  deuce.\r\n\r\nOccasionally these advertising notices take a widely different form, and\r\nrefer to the benefits which are to be found from a use of the columns\r\nin which they appear. Take the following as an instance of the kind of\r\nwork we mean:--\r\n\r\n  THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS has the largest circulation of any daily paper\r\n  published in the United States, and, with the exception of one in\r\n  England and one in France, the largest in the world. We will contract\r\n  for advertisements in the NEWS upon the following terms: Three (3)\r\n  cents per line for every (10) ten thousand of our circulation. Every\r\n  bill when presented to be accompanied with the sworn affidavit of the\r\n  pressman who prints the paper, the clerk who delivers the paper, and\r\n  the cashier who receives the money. No paper to be counted as\r\n  circulation except those that are actually sold and paid for.\r\n  Believing this to be the most fair and equitable plan ever offered to\r\n  advertisers, we make the proposition.\r\n\r\nThis is a fair and equitable idea which none but the proprietors of\r\nrival journals could object to. And that rivals do have their say about\r\neach other’s advertisements, the following article, which is called\r\n“Ensnaring the Simple,” and which at one stroke deals two blows--one in\r\nthe journalistic and the other in the electioneering interest--will\r\nshow. It is from a New York daily, and runs thus: “_The Sunday Mercury_\r\nis published by Cauldwell & Whitney, Editors and Proprietors. Its senior\r\neditor is William Cauldwell, late Senator from the IXth District,\r\ncomprising Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland Counties, and now the\r\nDemocratic candidate for re-election. From yesterday’s issue of that\r\n_Sunday Mercury_, we copy the following advertisements, omitting only\r\nthe addresses of the respective advertisers:--\r\n\r\n  TWO YOUNG MEN, residents of New-York, of some means, are desirous of\r\n  forming the acquaintance of two ladies between the ages of sixteen and\r\n  twenty-two, with a view to sociability and quiet enjoyment.

For particulars, address ----, Box\r\n  2, No. 688 Broadway.\r\n\r\n“These are but fair specimens of columns of such advertisements which\r\nhave for years appeared in the successive issues of _The Mercury_. The\r\npublishers put over them the head ‘Matrimonial,’ but the advertisers do\r\nnot countenance that fraud. They use _The Mercury_ and pay for it as\r\nthough it were a house of infamous resort; and, if there be any moral\r\ndifference between permitting this use and keeping a house of ill-fame,\r\nwe cannot see it. We do not doubt that at least One Thousand foolish\r\ngirls have been ruined through the instrumentality of these shameful\r\nadvertisements. Must not that be a monstrous dispensation of justice\r\nwhich, while Rosenzweig is (most righteously) sent to State Prison,\r\nshould send Cauldwell to the Senate? What do you think of it? Electors\r\nof Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland Counties! read the above\r\nadvertisements carefully, and say whether you can aid the election of\r\nCauldwell to the Senate without sharing his guilt? Do not pretend\r\nignorance of his iniquities: for above is the evidence which no man can\r\ngainsay. There are more such in this week’s issue, as there have been in\r\nevery issue of that sheet for years. Fathers, brothers, pure men of\r\nevery degree! read those infamous advertisements carefully, and then\r\njudge if you can vote to send their publisher to the Senate!” This is\r\nall very well, and extremely virtuous, but in the high-class daily\r\njournal from which it is taken there are plenty of advertisements of a\r\ncharacter anything but beyond reproach. We are far from wishing to\r\nuphold the character of the _Mercury_, which is no more and no less than\r\na Pandarus among papers, but the axiom, “Physician, heal thyself,” will\r\napply to the champion of outraged innocence just quoted.\r\n\r\nAn astonishingly elaborate way of bringing the “puff pars” of\r\nenterprising and liberal tradesmen under immediate notice is shown in a\r\nweekly, possessed of considerable notoriety, that is published in\r\nCalifornia. This paper, the _San Francisco Newsletter_, has several\r\ntimes with pleasing candour informed the world that its opinions and\r\nadvocacy are within easy purchase. Which means that those who do not\r\nthink its friendship worth buying had better beware of its animosity.\r\nFor those who doubt this we reproduce the following, which was probably\r\nplaced on the front page of the _Newsletter_ because the directors of\r\nthe company referred to refused to patronise that organ of publicity,\r\nand which has now been running for some time:--\r\n\r\n  A PERMANENT PARAGRAPHIC ADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n  [RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO THE SPRING VALLEY WATER WORKS.]\r\n\r\n  =A miner’s inch of water= is about twenty thousand gallons. The usual\r\n  price for an inch of water in the mines is ten cents. The Spring\r\n  Valley Company sells water in large quantities at seventy-five cents\r\n  per thousand gallons, or at fifteen dollars seventy-five cents per\r\n  inch--which is one hundred and fifty-seven times the price which\r\n  miners pay. Furnished in small quantities to housekeepers, the Company\r\n  charges from thirty to fifty dollars an inch--five hundred times the\r\n  miners’ rates.\r\n\r\n  IGNOTUS.\r\n\r\nThe _Newsletter_ was originally known in England as the vehicle of a\r\nvein of humour peculiar even in America, and mainly dependent upon a\r\ncontempt for all religious formalities and observances, an affectation\r\nof atheism, and an evident desire to render all those things ridiculous\r\nthat believers hold most sacred. Through all this ran a vein of ability\r\nwhich even those who objected most to the degradation of it were bound\r\nto admit, and the smart utterances of the chief writer on the staff were\r\nnot only quoted widely throughout America, but now and again found\r\nsupporters among advanced journalists in England. How different now is\r\nthe _Newsletter_! Its flippancy is as rampant as ever, but its attempts\r\nto make fun out of the doctrines of faith in general and Christianity in\r\nparticular are of the dreariest, while in place of the cleverness which\r\nonce made its columns readable there is a scurrility worthy of the\r\ntypical _Stabber_ or _Rowdy Journal_. And the more its ability becomes\r\ndeteriorated, the more do its abuse, its blasphemy, and its blackmailing\r\nqualities exhibit themselves. It is evident that the old leader has\r\ndeparted, and left in his place one whose servile imitation must have\r\nbeen his best credential for the office of successor.[47] But it was in\r\nreference to the _Newsletter’s_ advertisements that we commenced; though\r\nthey are in truth so mixed up with its other matter that the distinction\r\nis subtle indeed. The construction of the paper is unique. Each page is\r\ncomplete in itself, and in the “backs” and “gutters”--the inside\r\nmargins, in fact--there are numerous advertisements. The chief\r\npeculiarity, however, of the paper is that of spreading its puffs and\r\nnotices about among the ordinary matter. The following extract will give\r\nsome idea of the prevailing plan:--\r\n\r\n    “=Tell me=, O, thou ancient warrior,\r\n      How it is you look so strong.\r\n    Full well I know, for four-score years\r\n      You’ve wandered round--say, am I wrong?”\r\n\r\n    “I have lived for four-score years, sir,\r\n      Drinking naught but Cutter’s best.\r\n    If you want to live as long, sir,\r\n      I advise you to invest.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  =Shortening a Telegram.=--A gentleman took the following telegram to a\r\n  telegraph office:--“Mrs Brown, Liverpool street.--I announce with\r\n  grief the death of uncle James. Come quickly to read will. I believe\r\n  we are his heirs.--John Black.” The clerk, having counted the words,\r\n  said, “There are two words too many, sir.” “All right, cut out ‘with\r\n  grief,’” was the reply.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    =The other afternoon= I strayed,\r\n      About the hour of four,\r\n    To see if in the town I’d find\r\n      A first-class carpet store.\r\n\r\n    I wandered round for a long time,\r\n      Until a friend did tell\r\n    Where was the only place in town--\r\n      The store of Plum & Bell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  =As an early morning train= stopped at the station, an old gentleman\r\n  with a cheerful countenance stepped out on the platform, and inhaling\r\n  the fresh air enthusiastically exclaimed, “Isn’t this invigorating?”\r\n  “No, sir, it’s Auchterarder,” replied the conscientious porter. The\r\n  cheerful old gentleman went back to his seat in the carriage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    =All that my pining spirit= in its youth\r\n      Has pictured forth of excellence, is she;\r\n    The same ideal figure full of truth,\r\n      Alike in gentleness and purity:\r\n    By Bradley & Rulofson made divine.\r\n    Oh how I love to worship at her shrine!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  =The Man Who Struck Him.=--“Show me the man who struck O’Docherty,”\r\n  shouted a pugnacious little Irishman at an election; “show me the man\r\n  who struck O’Docherty, and I’ll--” “I am the man who struck\r\n  O’Docherty,” said a big, brawny fellow, stepping to the front; “and\r\n  what have you to say about it?” “Och, sure,” answered the small one,\r\n  suddenly collapsing, “and didn’t you do it well!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    =We cannot stay= thy footsteps, Time.\r\n      Thy flight no hand may bind\r\n    Save His, whose foot is on the sea,\r\n      Whose voice is in the wind.\r\n\r\n    Yet we can make a cloudy day\r\n      As bright as in sunshine,\r\n    And drive the demon care away\r\n      With draughts of Gerke Wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  =Mr. John Owens=, who lately died at Jackson, aged 114, was in some\r\n  respects a remarkable man.

Such a\r\n  boon to mankind is the Elixir Damiana, that the well known Doctor Jose\r\n  Juniga, from whose prescription it is made, has earned a name not soon\r\n  to be forgotten. The Elixir can be procured at Chas. Langley’s, the\r\n  agent, and at all drug stores.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  =Edmund Munger=, speaking of the time when he was a boy, says it was\r\n  the custom of school children as you passed a school-house, to make a\r\n  bow; but in these later days, as you pass a school-house, you must\r\n  keep your eye peeled, or you will get a snowball or a brickbat at the\r\n  side of your head.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    =Help me to sing=, ye muses Nine,\r\n    In praises of that house on Pine,\r\n    Which by its name, the Saddle Rock,\r\n    All praise and say the finest stock\r\n    Of oysters in the town are there;\r\n    Both raw, and cooked with greatest care.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  =Mr. Redpath= applied to Mr. Warner, author of “My Summer in a\r\n  Garden,” to enter the lecturing field.

There must now and again be a great run upon that\r\nedition of “Joe Miller” the proprietor keeps in his room, when the\r\n“exchanges” refuse to give out new or second-hand humorous paragraphs.\r\nWe will conclude this section of our cousins’ peculiarities with the\r\nfollowing, picked out from a Boston sheet, where it was nestled close by\r\nthe biggest of the advertisements:--\r\n\r\n  =Keep on Advertising.=\r\n\r\n  Don’t fear to have a small advertisement by the side of a larger\r\n  competing one. The big one can’t eat it up.\r\n\r\nWhich, freely translated, means, “Keep on advertising, and don’t be\r\nafraid. We’ll take you, big or little, so long as you have the money,\r\nand of course we’re quite disinterested.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1795, an English paper, speaking of the transatlantic\r\njournalism of the time, says: “As one proof of the commerce and trade of\r\nAmerica, there are four daily papers printed in the city of New York;\r\nand it is not uncommon to enumerate 350 advertisements in a single\r\npaper. The price of an advertisement is from 1s. to 1s. 6d., and a paper\r\nsells for one penny. But what injures the beauty and authenticity of\r\ntheir papers is the want of a little red mark at one corner of the\r\nsheet; a blessing that has been withheld from them since the imprudent\r\ndeclaration of independence.” The last remark is evidently satirical. It\r\nwas sixty years after this that we got rid of our glorious red mark. But\r\nwe have an advertisement of some years before the declaration of\r\nindependence, which is subjoined:--\r\n\r\n  _Bush Creek, Frederick’s County, Maryland_, Oct. 11, 1771.\r\n\r\n  RUN away from the subscriber, a Servant Maid named Sarah Wilson, but\r\n  has changed her name to Lady Susanna Carolina Matilda, which made the\r\n  public believe that she was her Majesty’s Sister; she has a blemish in\r\n  her right Eye, black rolled Hair, stoops in her shoulders, makes a\r\n  common practice of writing and marking her cloaths with a Crown and a\r\n  B. Whoever secures the said Servant Woman, or takes her home, shall\r\n  receive five Pistoles, besides all cost and charges.\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM DEVALL.\r\n\r\n  I entitle Michael Dalton to search the city of Philadelphia and from\r\n  thence to Charles-Town, for the said Woman.\r\n\r\n  W. D.\r\n\r\nSarah Wilson, who was quite an extraordinary adventuress, had been\r\nlady’s-maid to the Hon. Miss Vernon, sister to Lady Grosvenor, and\r\nwhilst in her service found means to obtain admittance into the royal\r\napartments, where she broke open a cabinet and robbed it of some\r\njewellery of value. For this she was apprehended, tried, and sentenced\r\nto death, but through the interposition of her former mistress was\r\nreprieved, and transported to Maryland, where on her arrival she was\r\nexposed for sale, and purchased by the Mr Devall above named. She soon,\r\nhowever, managed to make her escape into Virginia, travelled through\r\nthat colony, and through North into South Carolina. When at a proper\r\ndistance from Mr Devall, she assumed the title of Princess Susanna\r\nCarolina Matilda, and passed herself off as a sister to the Queen. She\r\nwas dressed in a manner likely to favour the deception, and as she had\r\nwith her part of the stolen jewels, and a miniature portrait of the\r\nQueen, which by some means she had managed to conceal before her trial\r\nand during her subsequent journey, she succeeded in deceiving many of\r\nthe planters. Thus she travelled from one gentleman’s house to another,\r\naffecting the manners of royalty, and admitting many of the gentry to\r\nthe honour of kissing her royal hand. To some she promised governments,\r\nto others regiments, with promotions of all kinds in the Army, Navy, and\r\nTreasury. In short, she acted her part so plausibly that very few\r\nsuspected her of being a deceiver. During the period of her imposture\r\nshe levied heavy contributions upon some people of the highest rank in\r\nthe southern colonies. At length the above advertisement appeared in the\r\npapers, and Mr Michael Dalton made his appearance in Charlestown,\r\nraising a loud hue and cry. Seeing that the game was up, her Serene\r\nHighness disappeared, and for a short time baffled the exertions of the\r\npolice; but in the end she was captured and suffered condign punishment.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of runaway slaves we will skip a few years, and so\r\ngive a companion to this Cleopatra in the person of one Anthony,\r\ncertainly a congenial spirit. The following is from a Raleigh paper of\r\nFebruary 1815, in which it is preceded by the figure of a runaway negro.\r\nAnthony is evidently a paragon possessed of all a paragon’s failings,\r\nand Caleb Quotem, so renowned in farce, scarcely equalled the subject of\r\nthis advertisement in the variety and whimsical nature of his\r\naccomplishments:--\r\n\r\n  TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS REWARD.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  RAN away from Raleigh, a month or two ago, a mulatto man, named\r\n  _Anthony_, well known in Raleigh, and many parts of the State, as\r\n  having been, for several years, the body servant of General Jones, and\r\n  mine lately as a pressman and news-carrier in the Star office. Anthony\r\n  is about twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, five feet eight or\r\n  ten inches high, is a mongrel white, has a tolerably large aquiline\r\n  nose, bushy hair, a scar on one of his cheeks; when in good humour has\r\n  a pleasing countenance.\r\n\r\n  He works and walks fast, is lively and talkative, full of anecdote,\r\n  which he tells in character with much humour; is an excellent\r\n  pressman, indifferent at distributing types, a tolerable carpenter and\r\n  joiner, a plain painter, an excellent manager of horses, drives well\r\n  and rides elegantly, having been accustomed to race riding; is fond of\r\n  cock-fighting (and of man-fighting when drunk), and is said to _heel_\r\n  and _pit_ with skill; he can bleed and pull teeth, knows something of\r\n  medicines, is a rough barber, a bad but conceited cook, a good sawyer,\r\n  can lay bricks, has worked in the corn fields, and can scratch a\r\n  little on the fiddle.\r\n\r\n  He can do many other things; and what he cannot do, he _pretends_ to\r\n  have a knowledge of. His trades and qualities are thus detailed,\r\n  because his vanity will undoubtedly lead to a display of them. His\r\n  master-vice, or rather, the parent of all his vices, is a fondness for\r\n  _strong drink_, though sometimes he will abstain for months. His\r\n  clothes cannot be described, but he carried away few or none, and ’tis\r\n  expected will appear shabbily. He is an artful fellow, and if taken up\r\n  will tell a most plausible story, and possibly show a forged pass.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 the _Connecticut Courant_ contained the following, which gives\r\nan unpleasant idea of what many wives might say in reply to the warning\r\nadvertisements of desperate husbands if they only thought it worth\r\nwhile, or rather if they thought of it at all:--\r\n\r\n  EAST WINDSOR, U.S.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS Hutchins has advertised, that I have absented myself from _his\r\n  bed and board_, and forbid all persons trusting me on his account, and\r\n  cautioned all persons against making me any payment on his account. I\r\n  now advertise the public, that the same Thomas Hutchins came as a\r\n  fortune-teller into this town about a year ago, with a recommendation,\r\n  which, with some artful falsehoods, induced me to marry him. Of the\r\n  four wives he had before me, the last he quarrelled away; how the\r\n  other three came by their deaths, he can best inform the public: but I\r\n  caution all widows or maidens against marrying him, be their desire\r\n  for matrimony ever so strong. Should he make his advances under a\r\n  feigned name, they may look out for a little, strutting, talkative,\r\n  feeble, meagre, hatchet-faced fellow, with spindle shanks, and a\r\n  little warped in the back.\r\n\r\n  THANKFUL HUTCHINS.\r\n\r\nThere are a good many more notices in the American papers which show\r\nthat conjugal infelicity is no great rarity over there. The following\r\nexquisite effusion appeared in the _Port Gibson Correspondent_ in\r\nNovember 1825:--\r\n\r\n    O matrimony! thou art like\r\n      To Jeremiah’s figs--\r\n    The good are very good indeed,\r\n      The bad--too sour for pigs!\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS, thank God! my wife Rachel has left my bed and board for the\r\n  hereafter mentioned provocation: this is to give notice that I will\r\n  pay no debts of her contracting after this date.--We were married\r\n  young; the match was not of our own choosing, but a made-up one\r\n  between our parents. “My dear,” says her mother, with a nose like a\r\n  gourdhandle, to her best beloved, “now if we can get our neighbour\r\n  Charles to consent to a marriage between our Rachel and his son, we\r\n  shall have no more care upon our hands, and live the rest of our days\r\n  in undisturbed repose.” Here my beloved began to whimper; the truth\r\n  is, she loved tenderly, loved another--and they knew it; he had no\r\n  property, however, and that was their only idea of happiness: but she\r\n  could not conceive how they could feast in joy upon her misery. “Hold\r\n  your tongue,” says her surly father, “don’t you think your parents\r\n  know better how to direct your attachments than you do yourself?”\r\n  “Yes, my dear,” says the mother, “you should always be governed by\r\n  your parents--they are old and experienced and you are too young to\r\n  think for yourself.” The old dad and mam forgot that they were a\r\n  runaway love match at the age of nineteen. But poor Rachel said not a\r\n  word for she was afraid of her daddy’s cowhide, that he had used\r\n  sixteen years on nobody’s back but his daughter’s. She seemed reckless\r\n  of her fate, was almost stupid, and did not know that she could alter\r\n  it for the worse. My father, by persuasion and argument, dazzled my\r\n  fancy with the eight negroes that would be her portion, “which,” said\r\n  he, “put upon the quarter section which I shall give you, will render\r\n  you independent, and you are a fool if you do not live happily with\r\n  such an angel.”--“Angel!” said I, but I said no more, for my dad (in\r\n  peace rest his ashes!) would have flown into a passion with the\r\n  rapidity that powder catches fire; and its ebullition, like the blaze,\r\n  would scorch me, I well knew.--We were married. I thought, as her\r\n  father had ruled her with so tough a whip, I could do it with a\r\n  hickory switch, and for my leniency gain her everlasting gratitude. We\r\n  have now lived together six years, and have had no offspring except a\r\n  hearty quarrel every little while. In truth I found her more spirited\r\n  than I imagined; she was always ready to tally word for word, and blow\r\n  for blow; but I never used a switch till the other day, always taking\r\n  my open hand. The other day, coming home from work, very much fatigued\r\n  and hungry, I found my wife in rather an unusual fit of passion,\r\n  scolding some pigs that had overset the buttermilk. “Rachel,” says I,\r\n  “make me some coffee.”--“Go to ----!” says she. I could not stand\r\n  this; I had never heard her swear before. “I will chastise you for\r\n  that,” says I. “Villain,” said she, “I’m determined to bear no more of\r\n  your ill usage. Instead of using the mild and conciliating language\r\n  which a husband ought to use, you always endeavour to beat me into\r\n  measures--touch me with that whip, I will leave your house, and take\r\n  my niggers with me too, so I will.” She had said such things so often\r\n  that I did not regard her, and belaboured her handsomely. The next\r\n  morning after I had gone out to work, away she bundles sure enough,\r\n  and when I came home at noon, I found the house emptied of bag and\r\n  baggage, and all the negroes taken but the three that were at work\r\n  with me. I have lived _happily_ since, however; and she may keep all\r\n  she took, if she will stay at her crooked-nose mammy’s and never\r\n  trouble my house again.\r\n\r\n  J. JOHNSTONE.\r\n\r\n  Laurence County, Miss.\r\n  Nov. 1, 1825.\r\n\r\nThis is a vigorous specimen of condensation, and contains, according to\r\nthe present standard, quite enough plot for a three-volume novel, with\r\nspecial opportunities for essays on the horrors of slavery. If any\r\nrising authoress--we will give way to a lady--should happen to stumble\r\nacross this book, and see her opportunity, we will waive all rights, as,\r\nafter trying to sketch out the story, it was abandoned in despair, owing\r\nto our inability to keep our wandering attention from the next\r\nadvertisement, which gives a companion picture, though the complaint is\r\nthis time laid by the woman:--\r\n\r\n  $100 REWARD--For the apprehension of Lewis Turtle, a tall man, about\r\n  50 years, has considerable money and a high forehead, long face and\r\n  lantern jawed man, a bad man, with a fist like a giant, and has often\r\n  beat me, and I want him to end his days in the Penitentiary where he\r\n  belongs, and he wears a grey coat, with a very large mouth, and one\r\n  blue eye, and one blind blue eye, and a hideous looking man, and now\r\n  living with the 7th woman, and me having one child to him, and he has\r\n  gone off, and I want him brought slap up in the law, with blue pants.\r\n  He ought to be arrested and has a $100 of my money, and a bald headed\r\n  rascal, full of flattery and receipt, and she is a bad woman, and her\r\n  little girl calls him “papa” and is called Eliza Jane Tillis, and a\r\n  boy blind of one eye, and he is not a man who has got any too much\r\n  sense, nor her. And he stole $100 from me, and some of my gold and\r\n  silver, and ought to be caught and I will never live with him again,\r\n  no never, he is a disgrace. And I would like to have him caught up and\r\n  compelled to maintain me and his child, as I am his lawful wedded\r\n  wife, and have the certificate of marriage in my possession.\r\n\r\n  NANCY TURTLE.\r\n\r\nCoherency was evidently not Nancy’s forte, and if she entertained her\r\nturtle-dove with much conversation as per sample, he was hardly to be\r\nblamed for trying a little change. In 1853 a sad and suffering husband\r\nsought consolation from the Muse, and published his lines in a\r\nConnecticut paper. Though not strictly in accordance with the rules laid\r\ndown by authorities, they contain a good deal in a small space:--\r\n\r\n    Julia, my wife, has grown quite rude;\r\n    She has left me in a lonesome mood;\r\n    She has left my board,\r\n    She has took my bed,\r\n    She has gave away my meat and bread,\r\n    She has left me in spite of friends and church,\r\n    She has carried with her all my shirts.\r\n    Now ye who read this paper,\r\n    Since she cut this reckless caper,\r\n    I will not pay one single fraction\r\n    For any debt of her contraction.\r\n\r\n  LEVI ROCKWELL.\r\n\r\n  _East Windsor, Conn. Aug. 4, 1853._\r\n\r\nAnother husband also flies to verse for consolation, and records both\r\nhis experiences and his determination in the following notice:--\r\n\r\n    Whereas my pet, my pretty toy,\r\n      My wife, my Lizzie J.,\r\n    Has left my bed and my employ,\r\n      With other men to stray.\r\n    I, therefore, take this to forewarn\r\n      You not to trust her with a straw,\r\n    For I will never pay her corn,\r\n      Unless compelled by law.\r\n\r\n  HENRY KANUTE.\r\n\r\n  BIG SUAMICO, Oct. 13, 1870.\r\n\r\nStill another husband, after publishing some supposed grievances in the\r\npublic prints, is made to see the error of his ways, and eats the leek\r\nin the following manner, and in a New York paper. Verse is here the\r\nsign not of the disease but of the remedy:--\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS I, Daniel Clay, through misrepresentation, was induced to post\r\n  my wife, Rhoda, in the papers; now I beg leave to inform the public,\r\n  that I have again taken her to wife, after settling all our domestic\r\n  broils in an amicable manner; so that everything, as usual, goes on\r\n  like clockwork.\r\n\r\n    Divorc’d like scissars rent in twain,\r\n      Each mourn’d the rivet out:\r\n    Now whet and riveted again,\r\n      They’ll make the old shears cut.\r\n\r\nWith a notification from a maligned as well as injured wife, this\r\nselection will probably be considered complete:--\r\n\r\n  NOTICE.\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS my husband Chas. F. Sandford, has thought proper to post me,\r\n  and accuse me of having left his bed and board without cause, etc., I\r\n  wish to make it known that the said Charlie never had a bed, the bed\r\n  and furniture belonging to me, given to me by my father; the room and\r\n  board he pretended to furnish me were in Providence, where he left me\r\n  alone, while he staid at the Valley with his “Ma.” He offered me $200\r\n  to leave him and go home, telling at the same time that I could not\r\n  stay at the place he had provided for me, and as I have never seen the\r\n  named sum, I suppose he will let me have it if I can earn the amount.\r\n  It was useless for Charlie to warn the public against trusting me on\r\n  his account, as my father has paid my bills since my marriage, as\r\n  before.\r\n\r\n  Moral.--Girls, never marry a man not weaned from his “Ma,” and don’t\r\n  marry the whole family.\r\n\r\n  ELEANOR J. SANDFORD.\r\n\r\n  North Providence, July 1, 1871.\r\n\r\nFrom such advertisements as the foregoing to those which emanate from\r\npersons desirous of becoming married is but a step; though, as has been\r\nalready shown, most of the applications which come under the head of\r\nMatrimonial in the New York papers hardly justify the selection. Here is\r\none, of a fair and honourable type enough, but it is fifty years old,\r\nbeing from the _New York Morning Herald_ of July 2, 1824. This probably\r\naccounts for its really meaning marriage, and nothing else:--\r\n\r\n  WANTED immediately a young LADY of the following description (as a\r\n  wife) with about 2000 dollars as a patrimony: Sweet temper, spend\r\n  little, be a good housewife and born in America; and as I am not more\r\n  than 25 years of age I hope it will not be difficult to find a good\r\n  wife.\r\n\r\n  N.B.--I take my dwelling in South Second Street, No. 273. Any lady\r\n  that answers the above description will please to leave her card.\r\n\r\nThis swain in his anxiety has forgotten to give either name or initials,\r\nso we cannot take steps to see whether or not he succeeded in getting a\r\n“rale Yankee gal.” The advertisements of the present day are mainly of\r\nthe character already quoted from the _Sunday Mercury_, in proof whereof\r\nwe take one cut at random from a paper published three thousand miles\r\naway from that estimable journal, viz., the _San Francisco Chronicle_:--\r\n\r\n  TWO FUN-LOVING YOUNG LADIES would like to correspond with an unlimited\r\n  number of young gentlemen; object, fun. Address, Roxey Hastings and\r\n  Gracie Baker, Virginia, Nevada.\r\n\r\n  jy17 2t*\r\n\r\nThis is barefaced enough, in all conscience; but it is by no means out\r\nof the way, and will stand as a fair example of the rest.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Waverley Magazine_, Boston--which is not a magazine as we\r\nunderstand the term, but a large broadsheet periodical--of four years\r\nback, we extract a batch of communications, which for convenience might\r\nbe called matrimonial, but which have little to do with marriage:--\r\n\r\n  CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n  _Two Dollars Each Address For One Insertion._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  A YOUNG MAN of good standing in society, of refinement and education,\r\n  desires an unlimited number of young-lady correspondents.\r\n  Respectability and education the only requisites.

Perhaps, though, it will be considered worthy the attention\r\nof philosophers, seeing that just now any new or startling view is sure\r\nto command not only regard but remuneration:--\r\n\r\n  Light developes light--_ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\n  St. Louis (Missouri Territory) North America.\r\n\r\n  April 10, A.D. 1818.\r\n\r\n  TO ALL THE WORLD.--I declare the earth to be hollow, and habitable\r\n  within; containing a number of concentric spheres, one within the\r\n  other, and that their poles are open twelve or sixteen degrees.

We will return in the\r\n  succeeding spring.--J. C. S.\r\n\r\nCaptain Symmes seems pretty positive about getting back, though how he\r\nintended to get up again after getting down into one of the lower\r\nspheres he doesn’t say. Perhaps a hundred brave companions, standing on\r\neach other’s heads, might manage it, and if that was the idea, one of\r\nour own learned societies might look into it. Good thick heads would of\r\ncourse be necessary to bear the strain, and that may be, after all, the\r\nreason why they are so plentiful. _Quien sabe?_ Far more within the ken\r\nof ordinary mortals is the following, which comes from Connecticut, and\r\nis well worthy of even that land of “notions:”--\r\n\r\n  THE SUBSCRIBER\r\n\r\n  BEING determined not to move from this State, requests all persons\r\n  indebted to pay particular attention to his\r\n\r\n  _New_ definition of an _Old_ Grammar, viz.\r\n\r\n  _Present Tense._\r\n\r\n  I am.

So many famous people have been called Smith, in America as well as\r\nhere, that it would be vain to attempt a discovery of his subsequent\r\ncareer. Maybe he went to New York, and composed the following\r\nadvertisement, which is just of three years’ later date, and seems\r\nstrange to those who know the Empire City in its present condition\r\nonly:--\r\n\r\n  ANY person in want of a DEAD PIG may find one, that will probably\r\n  answer his purpose, in the middle of Broadway, between Broome and\r\n  Spring Streets. Applicants need not be in any great haste, as it is\r\n  expected that he will lie there several days; and if the warm weather\r\n  should last, and the carriages will let him alone, he will\r\n  grow--_bigger and bigger_.\r\n\r\nGetting nearer to modern times--1822 is very old for American\r\nnotions--we find a New Yorker who speaks his mind freely, and treats his\r\ncustomers with moral illustration as well as business detail:--\r\n\r\n  GEORGE OTT, 262, North Second Street, respectfully informs his\r\n  customers and friends in general, that his bakehouse is in full\r\n  operation, and that he is always prepared to supply them with\r\n  loaf-bread, crackers, pilot-bread, fresh rusks, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of his list of wares, our baker proceeds, and no one can\r\naccuse him of mincing the matter:--\r\n\r\n  On his part nothing shall be left undone to give complete satisfaction\r\n  to his customers, and in return he expects them to _pay punctually_\r\n  when their bills are presented. Experience having taught him, that a\r\n  disorderly soldier in the ranks and a bad paymaster in a baker’s list\r\n  of customers, are the most troublesome customers a man can have\r\n  anything to do with, he requests those who do not calculate on paying\r\n  promptly, to oblige him so far as to give their custom to a more\r\n  accommodating baker.\r\n\r\n  Being anxious to take a journey for the benefit of his health, which\r\n  is much impaired, those indebted to him would oblige him very much by\r\n  making immediate payment; and he requests those who may have claims\r\n  against him to call and receive their money.\r\n\r\nPayment of quite a different kind is treated of in the next\r\nadvertisement, which few boys, old or young, will read without feeling\r\ninterested. It is, though in such few words, a marvellous exhibition of\r\nthe _suaviter in modo_ and the _fortiter in re_ well mixed; and one can\r\nwell understand the writer to be an agreeable friend and jolly\r\ncompanion, but a strict disciplinarian:--\r\n\r\n  _Flushing Institute._\r\n\r\n  DEAR BOYS--Trouble begins Septr. 15.\r\n\r\n  E. A. FAIRCHILD.\r\n\r\nIt was said of one of our public schoolmasters that it was a pleasure to\r\nbe flogged by him. We will take advantage of the present opportunity to\r\nremind those who have accepted it as a proverb, and believed it firmly,\r\nthat the originator of the remark, like the originators of many other\r\nobservations, never practically put his ideas to the test. Possibly on\r\nthe same principle it would be a pleasure to have one’s property sold\r\noff by auction, provided the advertisement were drawn out like that of\r\nthe Yankee auctioneer from which we select this portion:--\r\n\r\n  I can sell for eighteen hundred and thirty nine dollars, a palace, a\r\n  sweet and pensive retirement, on the virgin banks of the Hudson,\r\n  containing 85 acres. The land is luxuriously divided by the hand of\r\n  nature and art, into pasture and tillage, into plain and declivity,\r\n  into the stern abruptness and the dalliance of most tufted meadow.\r\n  Streams of sparkling gladness (thick with trout) dance through this\r\n  wilderness of beauty, to the music of the cricket and grasshopper. The\r\n  evergreen sighs as the evening zephyr flits through its shadowy bosom,\r\n  and the aspen trembles like the love-splitting heart of a damsel.\r\n  Fruits of the tropics in golden beauty melt on the bows, and the bees\r\n  go heavy and sweet from the fields to their garnering hives. The\r\n  stables are worthy of the steeds of Nimrod or the studs of Achilles,\r\n  and its henery was built expressly for the birds of paradise; while\r\n  sombre in the distance, like the cave of a hermit, glimpses are caught\r\n  of the dog house. Here poets have come and warbled their lays, here\r\n  sculptors have cut, here painters have robbed the scene of dreamy\r\n  landscapes, and here the philosopher discovered the stone which made\r\n  him the alchymist of nature. As the young moon hangs like a cutting of\r\n  silver from the blue breast of the sky, an angel may be seen each\r\n  night dancing with golden tiptoes on the greensward. (N.B. This angel\r\n  goes with the place.)\r\n\r\nEven our great Robins in his best form never exceeded this in\r\npicturesqueness of description. But our man could stay, and this one had\r\nshot his bolt when he got to the finish of the foregoing paragraph. At\r\nthe commencement of the war against the “Seceshers,” a good many of the\r\nNorthern tradesmen made capital out of it, the following, in a _Tribune_\r\nof February 1861, forming a case in point:--\r\n\r\n  IMPORTANT FROM CHARLESTOWN!\r\n\r\n  MAJOR ANDERSON TAKEN!\r\n\r\n  ENTRANCE OBTAINED UNDER A FLAG OF TRUCE!\r\n\r\n  NEW YORKERS IMPLICATED!\r\n\r\n  GREAT EXCITEMENT! WHAT WILL THE SOUTHERN\r\n  CONFEDERACY DO NEXT?\r\n\r\n  ON the 8th instant, about twelve hours before midnight, under cover of\r\n  a bright sun, Col. George S. Cooke, of the Charlestown Photographic\r\n  _Light_ Artillery, with a strong force, made his way to Fort Sumter.\r\n  On being discovered by the vigilant sentry, he ran up a flag of truce.\r\n  The gate of the fortress being open, Col. Cooke immediately and\r\n  heroically penetrated to the presence of Major Anderson, and levelling\r\n  a double barrelled camera, demanded his unconditional surrender in the\r\n  name of E. Anthony and the Photographic Community. Seeing that\r\n  resistance would be in vain, the Major at once surrendered, and was\r\n  borne in triumph to Charlestown, forwarded to New York, and is now on\r\n  sale in the shape of Exquisite Card Photographs at 28 cents per copy,\r\n  by E. Anthony, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n“Old McCalla” is or was a character well known in Princetown, Indiana. A\r\nfew years back, when the following was published, he was nearly ninety\r\nyears of age, but was still capable of minding his own business:--\r\n\r\n  WANTED.--Two or three boarders of a decent stripe, such as go to bed\r\n  at nine o’clock without a pipe or cigar in their mouth. I wish them to\r\n  rise in time to wash their faces and comb their heads before\r\n  breakfast. When they put on their boots to draw down their pants over\r\n  them, and not have them rumpled about their knees, which is a sure\r\n  sign of a rowdy. When they sit down to rest or warm by the fire, not\r\n  to put their feet on the mantlepiece or bureau, nor spit in the bread\r\n  tray. And to pay their board weekly, monthly, or quarterly--as may be\r\n  agreed upon--with a smile upon their faces, and they will find me as\r\n  pleasant as an opposum up a persimmon tree.\r\n\r\n  OLD MCCALLA.\r\n\r\nAnother boarding-house advertisement, which comes from Portland, Oregon,\r\nis also characteristic. A correspondent informs us that the Mr Thompson\r\nmentioned in it is a hard-working blacksmith, and he and his wife run\r\nthe concern on the temperance plan:--\r\n\r\n  THOMPSON’S TWO-BIT HOUSE,\r\n  _Front St., bet. Main and Madison_.\r\n\r\n  NO DECEPTION THERE!\r\n\r\n  HI-YOU MUCK-A-MUCK, AND HERE’S YOUR\r\n  BILL OF FARE:\r\n\r\n  THREE KINDS OF MEAT FOR DINNER; ALSO FOR Breakfast and Supper. Ham and\r\n  Eggs every other day, and Fresh Fish, Hot Rolls, and Cake in\r\n  abundance.\r\n\r\n  Hurry up; and none of your sneering at CHEAP BOARDING-HOUSES. Now’s\r\n  the time to have the wrinkles taken out of your bellies after the hard\r\n  winter.\r\n\r\n  Board and Lodging   $5 00\r\n  Board               $4 00\r\n\r\n  Six NEW rooms, furnished with beds--the BEST in town--at my Branch\r\n  House, corner First and Jefferson.\r\n\r\n  I am ready for the BONE and SINEW of the country.\r\n\r\n“Hi-you Muck a-muck,” we are also told, is a phrase in the Chinook\r\nlanguage for plenty to eat. What the Chinook language is we must leave\r\nour readers to discover for themselves. Is it “heathen Chinee” as\r\ndistinguished from the pure and unadulterated article? We pause for the\r\nreply of an expert, and while pausing, think that the following may be\r\ncontemplated with some degree of interest, for families over here are\r\ndrifting to the same state of difficulty very fast. A good servant is a\r\njewel to be worn in one’s bosom even in London, and so it is nothing\r\nwonderful that in Syracuse, U.S., five years back, this should have\r\nappeared:--\r\n\r\n  WANTED--A Good SERVANT GIRL to whom the highest wages will be paid.\r\n  Having had great difficulty in procuring good help, on account of the\r\n  misfortune of having seven small children, we will poison, drown, or\r\n  otherwise make away with four of them on application of a first class\r\n  servant girl. Apply at the office of this paper.\r\n\r\nWhat a glorious subject this would have been for Leech or Doyle in the\r\npalmy days of _Punch_, when wit and humour, and not high art and sober\r\nearnest, were considered essentials for the illustration of a comic\r\npaper, and when jokes were not regarded as ill-timed on the part of a\r\ncontributor! Historic painters are now the only humourists, and we do\r\nhope one, either English or American, may see this, and avail himself of\r\nit. The next is from an Iowa periodical, and will show our impartiality\r\nto all states in the Union, no one having received an undue share of\r\nattention--that is, beyond its merits. It will, besides, bring us up to\r\ncomparatively recent dates:--\r\n\r\n  CAUTION.\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS, one U. T. S. RICE, a small, insignificant-looking whelp, who\r\n  wears spectacles, carries a large cane, has a limp in his walk, talks\r\n  smooth, and lies like Satan, has been obtaining money and credit by\r\n  representing himself as a partner in the firm of Smart and Parrott, or\r\n  as agent for us: we hereby caution all persons that we are not\r\n  responsible for any of his acts. He is in no way connected with us,\r\n  but is a perfect dead beat in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\n“Dead beat” is a comprehensive and transatlantic euphemism for the more\r\nexpressive thief, scoundrel, swindler, or sharper, any one of which, or\r\nall four combined, if he so pleases, the “dead beat” may be; and the\r\nsubject of the Iowa notice seems a full-fledged and duly-qualified\r\nrepresentative of the class.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to state that in America quacks and quack\r\nmedicines abound. The papers are full of the advertisements of these men\r\nand their nostrums, and it would be quite easy to fill a very large\r\nvolume with specimens. So much attention has already been given to the\r\ncharlatans of Europe that we must perforce content ourselves with a very\r\nfew specimens from the _répertoires_ of their American brethren; but the\r\nchief difficulty is not what to select but what to omit. One of the\r\nevils which medical impostors in the States pretend to cure is that of\r\ndrunkenness, and a notice in _Harper’s Weekly_, which seems to be the\r\nchief organ of this kind of advertisers, runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n  DRUNKARDS, Stop! G. C. Beers, M.D., 670, Washington Street, Boston,\r\n  Mass., has a medicine that will cure intemperance. Recommended by\r\n  Judge Russell. Can be given secretly. Send stamp for circular.\r\n\r\nAnother vendor of specifics gives in the _New York Sun_ this astonishing\r\nstatement and purely unselfish promise:--\r\n\r\n  TRIED friends the best of friends. Since the suspension of H. C.\r\n  Thorpe’s advertisements, the number of deaths by consumption is truly\r\n  astonishing; advertisements will now appear for the benefit of the\r\n  afflicted.\r\n\r\nBut this is nothing compared with the marvellous Riga Balsam, about the\r\nincomparable virtues of which we have a long advertisement, which, after\r\nall sorts of extraordinary statements, ends thus:--\r\n\r\n  N.B. The trial of the Riga Balsam is this: Take a hew or a ram, drive\r\n  a nail through its skull, brains and tongue, then pour some of it into\r\n  the wound, it will directly stop the blood and cure the wound in eight\r\n  or nine minutes, and the creature will eat as before.\r\n\r\n  A stoop costs two dollars, and it is sold in smaller portions; at the\r\n  sale every person gets a direction which describes its surprising\r\n  virtues and how it is to be used. The glasses, jars and bottles, are\r\n  sealed up with this seal (A. K. Balsam) to prevent counterfeits.\r\n\r\n  _Ecclesiasticus_, chap. xxxiii. ver. 4. The Lord hath created\r\n  medicines out of the earth, and he that is wise will not abhor them.\r\n\r\nWhich forcibly reminds us of an equally wonderful specific which was\r\nknown in Holland about a century ago, if we may believe the _Dutch\r\nMercurius_ for January 1772, which states that “on December the 30th,\r\n1771, Mr Tunnestrik experimented in the presence of the Prince\r\nStadholder and sundry professors, by driving an iron spike into a\r\nhorse’s head, and afterwards pulling it out with a pair of pincers.\r\nHereupon he poured certain oils by him invented into the wound, by means\r\nof which the horse within six minutes was whole again, and not even a\r\nscar remained to be seen.” This horse, like the celebrated leg which was\r\ncured of its fracture with tar-water and oakum, must have been made of\r\nwood. With regard to the Riga Balsam, we might swallow that statement\r\nwith the assistance, say, of another wonderful American potion, the\r\nPlantation Bitters, which, if we are to judge by the following, could\r\nhelp anything down:--\r\n\r\n  S. T.--1860.--X.\r\n\r\n    TO be, or not to be, that is the question.\r\n    Whether to suffer with mental anguish,\r\n    Feverish lips, cracking pains, dyspeptic agonies,\r\n    And nameless bodily suffering;\r\n    Or whether, with sudden dash,\r\n    Seize a bottle of PLANTATION BITTERS,\r\n    And, as Gunther swears, be myself a man again.\r\n    Gunther said my eyes were sallow,\r\n    My visage haggard, my breath tremendous bad,\r\n    My disposition troublesome--in fact,\r\n    He gently hinted I was fast becoming\r\n    Quite a nuisance.\r\n    Four bottles now beneath my vest have disappeared:\r\n    My food has relish, my appetite is keen,\r\n    My step elastic, my mind brilliant, and\r\n    Nine pounds avoirdupois is added to my weight.\r\n\r\nThe formula “S. T.--1860.--X.” appears at the top of every advertisement\r\nof the bitters, and the first two portions doubtless refer to the name\r\nof the inventor and the date of the invention, while _x_ may be the\r\nunknown quantity which has to be taken before the promises held forth in\r\nthe advertisement are fulfilled. A good instance of the difference\r\nbetween precept and practice is shown by the annexed, which comes well\r\nfrom a firm in no way disdainful of the uses of advertising:--\r\n\r\n  S. T.--1860.--X.\r\n\r\n  SOME of our contemporaries seem to think that the triumph of their\r\n  cause depended, like the fate of Jericho, upon the amount of noise\r\n  made. In these days of refinement and luxury, an article of real\r\n  intrinsic merit is soon appreciated, hence the unbounded and\r\n  unparalleled success of\r\n\r\n  PLANTATION BITTERS.\r\n\r\nLike the two preceding, this is from _Harper’s Weekly_, the price for\r\nadvertisements in the inner pages of which is said to be 1 dollar 50\r\ncents per line, about five times as much as any of our highest priced\r\npapers, for the lines are by no means long for the money. The best\r\ncustomer _Harper’s_ has, and at the price perhaps the best customer any\r\npaper ever had, is Professor Leonidas Hamilton, who puffs himself in the\r\nmost extraordinary manner, being always well before his beloved public,\r\nand now and again having _seven_ columns of closely printed matter in\r\n_Harper’s_, at the exorbitant price just mentioned. This lengthy\r\nadvertisement is called “A Timely Warning, and the Reason Why,” and is\r\nconstructed upon truly Yankee principles. It commences:--\r\n\r\n  HOW sublime, how beautiful the thought that the researches and\r\n  developments of the Nineteenth Century have added fresh and glorious\r\n  laurels to the great temple of fame and science! In every department\r\n  and phase of progressive development the hand of the sage and\r\n  philosopher is ever busy--ever ready to devise means for the\r\n  amelioration of human woe and the prolongation of life.\r\n\r\n  Think you his an enviable position--an existence without stern\r\n  obstacles and perplexing cares? Nay, far from it; for he plucks the\r\n  lovely rose in peril of the thorn; he climbs to eminence and renown,\r\n  and every step he gains is planted on a prostrate foe. He digs the\r\n  gold and tries it; another and a bolder hand must strike the blow that\r\n  stamps its worth and gives it currency as genuine.\r\n\r\n  It must be admitted by every rational mind that the man who\r\n  contributes the most toward promoting the happiness and welfare of the\r\n  human race, must of necessity be the most highly esteemed by his\r\n  fellow-men; acting upon this principle, Prof. R. L. HAMILTON, of New\r\n  York, has, by patient investigation, and vast experience, solved the\r\n  uncertain question in relation to the vexed and important subject of\r\n  Liver Complaints and other chronic diseases.\r\n\r\nAfter a long preamble of this kind the Professor describes the “Symptoms\r\nof Liver Complaints,” from which by an easy transition he comes to some\r\n“Important Facts,” informing his “dear reader” that he “has remedies\r\nthat will strike at the root of them as by magic,” for “there is no such\r\nword as fail in his treatment.” After that, a couple of columns are\r\ndevoted to enumerate the “Reasons why Dr Hamilton is successful.” One of\r\nthese is--“Because he has investigated every remedy known to science,\r\nand, in addition, has new remedies, _of the fields and forests_ OF HIS\r\nOWN DISCOVERY, and of the greatest possible efficacy and value.” He ends\r\nthis part with the awful words, “The truth must be told if the heavens\r\nfall,” and a lot of testimonials are produced, each with a sensation\r\nheading, and relating the most wonderful effects produced by the\r\nDoctor’s medicines. Thus one has got “an old lung difficulty;” another\r\nhas “gained twenty pounds in three months,”--not money unfortunately,\r\nbut flesh. One of the most curious puffs arising out of these\r\ntestimonials is the following:--\r\n\r\n  IS ALL THIS TRUE?\r\n\r\n  Mr. Samuel L. Furlong, of Muskegan, Mich., in a letter dated April 6,\r\n  1868, writes:\r\n\r\n  “I have cut out SEVENTEEN of the testimonials that were in the _New\r\n  York Tribune_, and sent them to the persons themselves, with letters\r\n  of inquiry about them, and also about you, and every one stated that\r\n  they were true, and recommending your remedies very highly; also\r\n  giving a history of their cases, which was, indeed, very cheering to a\r\n  poor man, with a sick wife and six small children to support.”\r\n\r\nThe inconsequence of the conclusion is quite refreshing. What benefit\r\nthis distressed family could have derived from the perusal of the\r\ntestimonials we will not presume to say. Thus by an easy climax of\r\nsensational headings and cures, we arrive at three final articles,\r\nrespectively headed, “In his mercy he saves the afflicted!”--“Read, ye\r\nafflicted”--and “Appreciate it fully.” Then follows the “Conclusion”\r\nthat it would be useless to cry “humbug,” for the above parties have\r\nvolunteered to give their evidence for the benefit of the suffering and\r\nfor no other purpose, and the whole ends with a friendly recommendation\r\nto “have no hesitancy in writing to the Doctor, and state to him your\r\ncase in full, and he will deal honestly and promptly with you.”\r\n\r\nAnother very extensive dealer in advertisements, who also uses\r\n_Harper’s_ columns considerably, is the proprietor of the Pain Paint.\r\nHis works are humorous and entertaining, the following being a fair\r\nexample:--\r\n\r\n    MY WIFE HAD AN ULCER\r\n    On her Leg\r\n    Thirteen years,\r\n    Caused by various veins\r\n    Extending from her ancle to her knee.\r\n    Some places eaten away\r\n    To the bone.\r\n    I have employed\r\n    Over twenty eminent physicians\r\n    At vast expense,\r\n    But all attempts at cure\r\n    Proved utterly abortive\r\n    Until I used Wolcott’s Pain Paint,\r\n    Which the Doctors told me\r\n    Was humbug.\r\n    But humbug or not\r\n    It has done the work complete\r\n    In less than one month,\r\n    Removing the pain\r\n    At first application.\r\n    I kept her leg wet\r\n    With PAIN PAINT constantly\r\n    Till healed.\r\n    I wish we had more humbugs as useful\r\n    As Dr. Wolcott’s PAIN PAINT.\r\n    I am well known in this city,\r\n    And any person\r\n    Can make further inquiry\r\n    At 101 West Street, New York,\r\n    At the Hanover House\r\n    Of which I am proprietor.\r\n    And I think I can satisfy\r\n    All as to the benefit\r\n    Derived by the use of PAIN PAINT.\r\n\r\n  May 12, 1868.\r\n\r\n  PETER MINCK.\r\n\r\nThere are many advertisements from Hamilton, Wolcott, and various other\r\n“professors” still before us, but with the foregoing we will conclude,\r\nand leave the curious to search the American journals for themselves.\r\nThose who like to take the trouble will find in them an inexhaustible\r\nmine of wealth. The reflection naturally arises in the minds of readers,\r\nthat the Americans cannot, after all, be such a wonderfully smart\r\nnation, to allow an almost countless horde of quacks and impostors to\r\nbatten on them, and to make large fortunes even in the face of the\r\ntremendous sums they have to pay for advertisements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nExtensive as our Colonies are, and numerous and excellent as are the\r\nnewspapers published in them, the advertisements of the present day may\r\nbe said with justice to offer no distinctive features whatever. With\r\nthe exception of the names of streets and towns, the trade and other\r\nnotices are just the same as appear in the home journals; and even the\r\ncries which now and again go up from the Australian papers for missing\r\nrelatives are paralleled by similar advertisements constantly appearing\r\nin our own metropolis. We have, though, two or three quaint old\r\nspecimens which have been lighted upon at rare intervals, and more\r\nbecause it would be unfair to pass over our extensive dependencies\r\nwithout mention than for any other reason we offer them to the\r\nconsideration of the reader. The first is nearly eighty years old, and\r\nis copied verbatim from a Jamaica paper of the period:--\r\n\r\n  _Kingston, March 7, 1795._\r\n\r\n  HALF-A-JOE REWARD.\r\n\r\n  WALKED away, about a Month ago, a Negro Wench, named _Prudence_; she\r\n  is of the Eboe Country, a yellow Complexion, round chubby Face, goggle\r\n  or full Eyes, has lost several of her fore Teeth, is short, lively,\r\n  and active, a great Thief, speaks quick and tolerable good English; is\r\n  one of the black Parson Lisle’s Congregation; she is marked on both\r\n  Shoulders and the left Cheek R. L.; had a Collar about her Neck, Chain\r\n  and Lock, as a Punishment for her trying to entice a Man away the\r\n  second Time; she is capable of very great Deception; she lards almost\r\n  every Word with “plase God,” or some pious Expression, and will thieve\r\n  at the same Time.\r\n\r\n  It is likely she will endeavour to pass as free; she formerly belonged\r\n  to Mary Roberts, and lately to Sarah Osborn; she has been twenty Years\r\n  in the Town of Kingston, and about fourteen Months in the Country.\r\n  When she left Kingston she secreted a Quantity of her Clothes with\r\n  some of her Tribe; if gone there, she will be able to change her\r\n  Dress. Is well acquainted in Spanish-town, and many other Parts of the\r\n  Island; she possesses a great Share of the “holy Goggle,” that is,\r\n  throwing up her Eyes, and calling upon everything that is sacred, even\r\n  when stolen Goods have been found upon her.

It refers to a raffle for\r\nwomen, and was published in a daily paper of Calcutta:--\r\n\r\n  FEMALES RAFFLED FOR.--Be it known, that Six Fair Pretty Young LADIES,\r\n  with two sweet and engaging CHILDREN, lately imported from Europe,\r\n  having roses of health blooming on their cheeks, and joy sparkling in\r\n  their eyes, possessing amiable tempers and highly accomplished, whom\r\n  the most indifferent cannot behold without expressions of rapture, are\r\n  to be raffled for, next door to the British Gallery. Scheme: Twelve\r\n  Tickets, at 12 rupees each; the highest of the three throws,\r\n  doubtless, takes the most fascinating, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nModern improvements have, after all, somewhat benefited the world. Who\r\nwould dream nowadays of such a scheme having been publicly advertised in\r\na British dominion less than sixty years since? And this was not by any\r\nmeans the latest of such speculations either, yet it will be news to\r\nmany that, even at the date given, such transactions were openly\r\nconducted. The next, also from Calcutta, is half-a-dozen years later,\r\nand treats of quite another vanity of the owners of the soil:--\r\n\r\n  NOTICE.--Mr W. M‘Cleish begs to state to his friends and the public\r\n  that he has received by the most recent arrivals the Prettiest\r\n  Waistcoat Pieces that were ever seen: really it would be worth any\r\n  gentleman’s while even to look at them. It surpasses his weak\r\n  understanding, how man who is born of a woman and full of trouble,\r\n  could invent such pretty things.\r\n\r\n  It strikes him forcibly that the patterns and texture must have been\r\n  undoubtedly invented by some wise philosopher.\r\n\r\n    Ladies, although my shop’s small, I pray you won’t fear,\r\n    I turned out my pelisses, the first of the land sure may wear;\r\n    If they are not well finished, or the best of trimmings--\r\n    I will undertake to eat backs, breasts, sleeves, and linings.\r\n\r\n  No. 39, Cossitollah, Jan. 4, 1824.\r\n\r\nAustralia offers us, by means of the _Sydney Gazette_ of August 1825, an\r\nadvertisement worth perusal:--\r\n\r\n  MRS BROWN respectfully thanks the community of thieves for relieving\r\n  her from the fatigues and wearisomeness of keeping a chandler’s shop,\r\n  by taking the following goods off her hands; viz.--35 yards of\r\n  shirting, 12 do. of muslin, 40 do. of calico, and various articles, as\r\n  the auctioneer terms it, “too many to mention in an advertisement.”\r\n  But the gentlemen in their despatch of business forgot that they had\r\n  taken along with them an infant’s paraphernalia, two dozen of clouts,\r\n  so elegantly termed by washerwomen. If the professors of felony do not\r\n  give a dinner to their pals, and convert them into d’oyleys for finger\r\n  glasses, Mrs Brown will thank them to return them, as they would not\r\n  be so unmagnanimous and deficient of honour to keep such bagatelles\r\n  from a poor mother and four children. This is to apprize the receivers\r\n  of stolen property, that she will sooner or later have the pleasure of\r\n  seeing their necks stretched, and that they will receive a tight\r\n  cravat under the gallows by their beloved friend Jack Ketch. As the\r\n  old saying is “The better the day the better the deed,” the fraternity\r\n  performed their operations on Sunday night last.\r\n\r\n  17, Philip Street.\r\n\r\nAnother from the same source, though of somewhat later date, refers to a\r\nfailing not at all peculiar to the ladies and gentlemen of Sydney, as\r\nmost owners and collectors of books have doubtless discovered ere now to\r\ntheir cost:--\r\n\r\n  IT is requested that those Ladies and Gentlemen who have, from time to\r\n  time, borrowed books from Mr. S. Levy, will return them to the\r\n  undersigned, who respectfully solicits all books now in possession of\r\n  persons to whom they do not belong, to comply with the above--a fresh\r\n  supply may be had. Among the number missing are the Pastor’s Fire\r\n  Side, Tales of my Landlord, Kenilworth, Princess Charlotte, Secret\r\n  Revenge, Smollett’s Works, Ivanhoe, Tales of the Times, Paradise\r\n  Lost--so are the books until found by\r\n\r\n  B. LEVY.\r\n\r\n  No. 72, George Street, Sydney.\r\n\r\nThe solicitation to the books themselves “to comply with the above,” is\r\nno doubt an Australian figure by which, in order to avoid an obnoxious\r\naccusation against the borrowers, the books are supposed to be unwilling\r\nto return to the rightful owners. Between forty and fifty years ago it\r\nwould have been very unpleasant in Australia to imply that any one had a\r\ndesire to take that which belonged to any one else with a view to its\r\npermanent detention.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the advertisements of more modern times call for no\r\nparticular mention, and the papers published in New South Wales and\r\nVictoria--excellent journals, some of them capitally illustrated, and\r\nall equal to anything at home--contain nothing in their columns of a\r\nkind different from what has been already given under some one or other\r\nof the various chapter heads of this volume. In Canada the contiguity of\r\nthe States is now and again apparent in the advertisements; but after\r\nthe full-flavoured samples of the latter, anything from the Dominion\r\nwould seem poor indeed.\r\n\r\n  [47] It is only fair to Americans in general, to state that the\r\n  proprietor of this the most American of all American papers is an\r\n  Englishman. At least, we are informed so by men who remember him in\r\n  London.\r\n\r\n  [48] Andrew Smith.\r\n\r\n  [49] Any one the coat fits.\r\n\r\n  [50] Hezekiah Goddard, Sheriff’s Deputy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n_ADVERSARIA._\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of this book towards completion, we have now and\r\nagain stumbled across something which would not consistently fit under\r\nany of the chapter heads in our plan, nor stand well by itself, and\r\nthough at first rather puzzled what to do with these trifles, they have\r\nin the end accumulated sufficiently to form a chapter of varieties which\r\nwill fitly conclude, and will doubtless prove neither dull nor\r\nuninteresting. In advertising there seems to be always something new\r\nspringing up, and no sooner do we think we have discovered the last\r\ningenious expedient of the man anxious to display his wares, or to tempt\r\nothers to display theirs, than another and more novel plan for publicity\r\narrests the attention, and makes its predecessor seem old-fashioned, if\r\nnot obsolete. At the present moment the plan of an energetic Scotchman\r\nis the very latest thing in advertisements. Whether it will be\r\nconsidered a novelty six months hence, or whether it will be considered\r\nat all, it would be hard indeed to say, so it will perhaps be enough for\r\nus to give the plan to our readers, with the remark that after all the\r\nidea is not unlike that of the old newsletters to which reference has\r\nbeen made in an earlier portion of this work. The Scotchman’s notion is\r\nto substitute advertisements for the intelligence contained in the\r\nancient letters, and thereby reap a rich reward. For sixpence he sells\r\ntwenty-four sheets of letter-paper, on the outside of each of which is\r\nan embossed penny postage-stamp. He fills the two inside pages with\r\nsixty advertisements, for which he charges one guinea each, leaving the\r\nfirst page for private correspondence, and the last page, to which the\r\nstamp is affixed, for the address. As the stamp will carry an ounce\r\nweight, another sheet of plain paper may be enclosed. He guarantees to\r\nthe advertiser a circulation of five thousand copies. For the\r\nadvertisements he receives £63, from which he pays five thousand stamps\r\nat one penny each--£20, 16s. 8d.--less received for copies sold\r\n(twenty-four for sixpence), £5, 4s. 2d.; total, £15, 12s. 6d., leaving\r\nthe difference, £47, 7s. 6d., to cover the cost of paper and printing.\r\nIt will be remembered by many that the plan of giving advertisement\r\nsheets away has been often tried--notably with metropolitan local\r\nnewspapers, some of which at first thought to clear the whole of their\r\nexpenses by means of the charge for notices, &c. It is remarkable,\r\nhowever, that these journals invariably did one of two things. They\r\neither got a price fixed on themselves, or died. It is hard to make\r\nadvertisers believe that it is worth while paying for a notice in a\r\npaper which is itself not worth paying for, and no arguments as to\r\nincreased circulation seem to have any effect.\r\n\r\nParisian advertisements form an item worthy of attention here. Within\r\nthe past few years a great change has taken place in the system of\r\nadvertising as known in the capital of France--in fact, as known in all\r\nthe chief towns of the empire, kingdom, republic--whichever our readers\r\nlike best or consider the most correct word. Between twenty-five and\r\nthirty years ago advertisements were charged at very high rates in the\r\nParis papers, and there were comparatively few of them. The proprietors\r\nof journals did not themselves deal with the advertisers, but farmed out\r\ntheir columns at so much a year to advertising establishments or\r\nagencies. This was both convenient for the papers and profitable for the\r\nagencies. The rates they fixed for advertising in some of the most\r\nprominent journals were--_Presse_, one franc per line for each\r\ninsertion; _Siècle_, one franc fifty centimes per line each insertion\r\nfor four times, for ten times and upwards one franc per line, special\r\nnotices three francs per line, editorial items five francs per line;\r\n_Nation_ and _Débats_, four lines seventy-five centimes per line,\r\nadvertisements above 150 lines fifty centimes per line, special notices\r\ntwo francs per line, editorial items three francs; _Galignani’s\r\nMessenger_, seventy-five centimes a line each time, one advertisement\r\nabove 300 lines fifty centimes a line, editorial items three francs.\r\nOther papers were lower, some taking advertisements for from twenty-five\r\nto forty centimes, and charging from one franc to two francs a line for\r\neditorial items; but their circulation was very limited. What are called\r\nbroadside advertisements were very frequent in Paris papers; they were\r\nvery ugly affairs to the eye of an Englishman; set up in sprawling\r\ncapitals, like a handbill, a single advertisement frequently covering\r\nhalf or the whole of a page of a newspaper. This style of advertisement\r\nobtains now, but under different principles. The _Presse_ and the\r\n_Siècle_ used to make more money than any of the other papers by means\r\nof advertisements; in the year 1847 the income of the _Presse_ for its\r\ntwo advertising pages was 300,000 francs. The advertising of the\r\n_Débats_ and _Constitutionnel_ was also profitable.\r\n\r\nThings have very considerably changed since then, and Parisian\r\nadvertising may fairly be said to have become developed into a\r\nflourishing, though at the same time a very unique, system. The remark,\r\n“Show me the advertisements of a country, and I will tell you the\r\ncharacter of its inhabitants,” is not yet current among the choice\r\nsayings of great men, yet it or something similar might well be said\r\nwith regard to modern Parisian notifications. Perhaps in no country so\r\nmuch as in France are public announcements and advertisements so\r\nthoroughly characteristic of a people. An important law recently\r\nintroduced compels all announcements fixed or displayed in public places\r\nto bear each a ten-centime stamp, and the Government reserves to itself\r\nthe right of alone using a perfectly white _affiche_. All posters,\r\nplaybills, and placards unconnected with State matters must be printed\r\non coloured paper, though a small portion may remain white. The\r\nParisians are proverbially neat in everything but their personal habits;\r\nand ugly, gaunt, straggling hoardings like those of London are quite\r\nunknown to them. The principal vacant places in front of building ground\r\nare usually purchased by one of the principal Sociétés de Publicité. A\r\nlarge frame of wood and canvas is affixed to the hoarding and divided\r\ninto a number of squares, which are painted a neutral tint. Then in all\r\nthese squares different announcements are made in gay colours. When\r\ncompleted, the structure resembles the boards of advertisements placed\r\nin railway carriages and omnibuses, the scale of course being\r\nconsiderably larger. A well-executed painting of some country seat or\r\npark to let frequently figures in these spaces; and few stations are\r\nwithout some well-known and familiar advertisement, the French having\r\nlike ourselves some firms which make it their business to be on every\r\nhoarding and in every paper. A large tailoring and drapery establishment\r\nwhich advertises as follows is perhaps the best known of any:--\r\n\r\n  MAISON DE LA RUE DE\r\n  PONT NEUF\r\n\r\n  HABILLEMENTS PR HOMMES ET ENFANTS\r\n\r\n  ON REND L’ARGENT DE TOUT ACHAT QUI À\r\n  CESSE DE PLAIRE\r\n\r\n  =LA MAISON N’EST PAS AU COIN\r\n  DU QUAI=.\r\n\r\nThis advertisement is so well known that recently a _revue_ bearing the\r\ntitle “La Maison n’est pas au Coin du Quai” was played at a well-known\r\ntheatre, and in the recent version of “Orphée aux Enfers” at the Gaîté,\r\nthe “on rend l’argent” portion is made the peg for a joke by the Monarch\r\nof Hell. The following also persistently arrest the attention of the\r\ntraveller: “Au Bon Diable,” “Eau Melisse des Carmes,” “Chocolat Ibled,”\r\nand “Old England British Tailors.” The “Piano Quatuor” is also\r\neverywhere typified by the picture of a gentleman with hideous long\r\nfingers and pointed nails stretching over the strings of four violins.\r\n\r\nThe theatres usually display their programmes on large columns specially\r\nconstructed for the purpose, which are fixed about every two hundred\r\nyards along the principal Boulevards. As these bills are renewed nearly\r\nevery day, this department alone must be very remunerative to the\r\nGovernment. No playbills are sold in the theatres, but many of the daily\r\njournals publish the programmes of all; and three papers, the\r\n_Vert-Vert_, the _Orchestra_, and the _Entr’acte_, are specially printed\r\nto serve as bills of the play. One peculiar circumstance connected with\r\ntheatrical advertisements is worthy of notice. In each of those places\r\nof public convenience known to Parisians as “Les Colonnes Rambuteau,”\r\nsome mysterious individual has for years pasted a little piece of paper\r\nannouncing the drama at the Ambigu Comique and the principal performers\r\ntherein. Here is an exact copy of the one appearing during the month of\r\nJune of the present year (1874):--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Mm Vannoy Mont-bars et M^{d.} Ribeaucourt\r\n  L’Amant de la Lune\r\n  drame en 7 tableaux de\r\n  Paul de Kock.\r\n  L’Ambigu Comique tous les soirs_\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor years some unknown person has thus maybe gratuitously advertised the\r\nhouse in question, and his identity is one of the mysteries of Paris.\r\nTwo well-known Parisian journalists, piqued by the eccentricity of the\r\nadvertisement, lay in wait one whole night and day for the purpose of\r\ndiscovering its author, but their effort was fruitless. While on the\r\nsubject of these _colonnes_, we may note the fact that their exteriors\r\nare covered with advertisements, the most conspicuous among them being\r\nthe bill of fare of the “Dîner de Rocher,” a three-franc ordinary on the\r\nBoulevard Montmartre. The interior announcements are not of a nature for\r\npublication, and in that respect resemble kindred establishments this\r\nside the Channel. Next in importance to the hoardings and “spectacle”\r\ncolumns are the kiosques, in which the newspaper trade of Paris is\r\nchiefly carried on. The front is open, with the paper stall before it;\r\nbut the remaining sides are of coloured glass, and each square contains\r\nan advertisement painted or stained upon it, generally in large letters.\r\nAt night the light in the interior gives the kiosque a very gay and\r\nfestive appearance. There are various minor methods of attracting public\r\nattention practised by the Parisian traders. The managers of the Louvre\r\nand Pygmalion, establishments similar to our Shoolbred’s and Meeking’s,\r\ngive to each of their customers an air balloon with the name of the\r\nestablishment from which it is issued painted upon it. Thousands of\r\nthese are constantly bobbing about along the principal thoroughfares.\r\nThe tickets given to seat occupiers in the public gardens and parks are\r\nbeautifully illuminated cards covered with trade announcements. Some of\r\nthe restaurants give each of their lady-customers a fan in summer, which\r\nis prettily ornamented with advertisements. At Duval’s famous eating\r\nestablishments the backs of the bills of fare are sold for a large sum\r\nto advertising contractors. It is calculated that this firm issues\r\n30,000 _cartes_ a day. Space will not allow us to enumerate the further\r\nthousand-and-one plans--some sensible, some silly--which the Parisians\r\nadopt for attracting public attention; we therefore pass on to the last\r\nand most important medium for advertisements--the Parisian newspapers.\r\nIn French journals, as in some English, the _réclame_, or editorial\r\npuff, is eagerly sought after; and for unblushing effrontery in selling\r\ntheir pens to pushing tradesmen, we must yield the palm to our brother\r\nscribes across the water. “They order this matter better in France.”\r\nOnly a short time since M. de Villemessant, the editor of _Le Figaro_,\r\ngave a delightful specimen of the art in his own columns. He commenced\r\nby relating the history of the Duke of Hamilton and the sheep’s wool\r\nleft on the brambles. Then came a long description of the homes of the\r\nHighland shepherds, and their spinning wives. The English word\r\n“homespun” being thus introduced, the article wound up by advising _les\r\ngentlemen français_ to rush to a certain shop in Paris where homespun\r\nwas sold, and be measured for suits. A few days after the article had\r\nbeen published, its author was sauntering along the Boulevards clad in a\r\nhomespun suit of the latest cut and pattern.\r\n\r\nWe present a choice specimen of the _réclame_ cut from the pages of the\r\nParisian _gommeux’s_ favourite journal:--\r\n\r\n  _Le Figaro_ n’oublie pas que son aïeul était coiffeur, aussi ne\r\n  dédaigne-t-il pas de parler des chevaliers du démêloir, surtout\r\n  lorsque ceux-ci se recommandent à l’attention du public par des\r\n  qualités hors ligne.\r\n\r\n  Nos lecteurs du quartier de l’Arc-de-Triomphe, y compris les Ternes,\r\n  l’avenue de l’Impératrice, Neuilly, etc., ne se doutent pas qu’ils\r\n  possèdent dans leur voisinage, 47, avenue de la Grande-Armée, un\r\n  expert en fait de coiffures de femmes et d’hommes... Il se nomme\r\n  Rivals et n’en connait pas (pardon!) pour la dexterité du peigne et la\r\n  légèreté du rasoir.\r\n\r\nHere is another of these exquisite specimens of artistry in puffing. It\r\nis from _La Vie Parisienne_ of a short time back:--\r\n\r\n  --Les voyageurs pour la ligne d’Italie montent en voiture.\r\n\r\n  --Une minute, sac à papier! je n’ai pas pris mon café.\r\n\r\n  --Un qui se croit encore au temps des diligence: le chemin de fer\r\n  n’attend pas.\r\n\r\n  --N’est-ce que cela, cher? monte dans mon compartiment, et tu n’auras\r\n  pas à regretter la chicorée du buffet.\r\n\r\n  Le sifflet fait entendre son son strident. Nous voici partis! Nous\r\n  avons tiré de son sac de voyage un flacon d’_Essence de café Trablit_.\r\n  Il me fait un mazagran que je sirote avec autant de délices que si\r\n  Tortoni l’eût préparé.\r\n\r\n  En crème, a l’eau, au lait, en grog, l’_Essence de café Trablit_ est\r\n  chose exquise. Recommandée aux voyageuses, dans leur intérêt. 1 fr. 60\r\n  le flacon (67, rue Jean-Jacques-Rousseau).\r\n\r\nBesides writing up the goods of energetic and aspiring tradesmen, the\r\nFrench journalist is frequently employed by a third or fourth rate\r\nactress to write her into notoriety. To do this he carefully avoids any\r\nmention of her histrionic abilities; but whenever he gets an\r\nopportunity, he describes her dresses, her equipage, her _petits\r\nsoupers_, and occasionally places in her mouth some clever repartee or\r\ndaring joke. Once in vogue, a lady of this kind has obtained the object\r\nof her ambition, and many a queen of the _demi-monde_ owes her success\r\nin the realms of guilty splendour to the constant puffing of some\r\nhireling scribe. Hireling though he be, the scribe is also an artist,\r\nand his work bears an immeasurably favourable comparison with that of\r\nhis clumsy English rival; for he has rivals in England, and _réclames_\r\nare finding their way rapidly into the most pretentious of our papers.\r\nHitherto they have succeeded in deceiving none so much as their waiters\r\nand those who pay for them; but there is yet hope. Occasionally the\r\nFrench _réclame_ mania is worked up into a good joke, as in the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n  Une maison de blanc portant pour enseigne: _Au bon petit Jésus_, avait\r\n  pour caissier un affreux gredin qui disparaît un jour avec la\r\n  grenouille tout entière.\r\n\r\n  Tous les journaux sont pleins du vol commis au _Bon petit Jésus_.\r\n\r\n  Le patron court affolé et met la main sur son employé au moment où\r\n  celui-ci prenait tardivement le chemin de fer. Il lui saute au collet:\r\n\r\n  --Miserable! tu m’as ruiné!\r\n\r\n  L’autre répond, sans s’émouvoir:\r\n\r\n  --Oui, monsieur... mais quelle réclame pour la maison!\r\n\r\nSometimes the advertisement is given in an indirect manner: thus the\r\npublic read the following in the day’s paper:--\r\n\r\n  Un détail amusant.\r\n\r\n  Sur le rideau d’annonces des Bouffes on peut lire ce qui suit:\r\n\r\n  _Mesdames, souvenez-vous que les vieilles robes et les ameublements\r\n  fanés teints par la maison X... sont plus beaux que neufs!_\r\n\r\n  Comme c’est bien en situation!\r\n\r\nThe next time the reader goes to the theatre the advertisement alluded\r\nto catches his eye, and the address is fixed in his memory.\r\n\r\nThe _réclame_ is at present an important feature of French journalism.\r\nIt generally pays all parties concerned in its manufacture, and its\r\nexistence is therefore likely to continue for long. The reader has only\r\nto pick up _Le Gaulois_, _Le Figaro_, or any of the Parisian lighter\r\npapers, and he will be enabled to see for himself to what an extent\r\ncommerce has infected the Gallic press.\r\n\r\nTurning from the _réclames_ to the advertisements proper, we find there\r\nare five distinct specimens of the latter, so far as style is concerned.\r\nEach one of these has its modifications, but the following samples will\r\nbe found very near the mark. The first will serve a double purpose, as\r\nit seems to point out that despite the ridicule cast on English costumes\r\nby Parisian satirists, there are not a few who wear them, though they\r\nhave every opportunity of appearing in the Frenchest of French\r\nfashions:--\r\n\r\n  =PANTALONS ANGLAIS=\r\n  =FAITS SUR MESURE: 19 fr 50=\r\n\r\n  =OLD ENGLAND=\r\n  _35, boulevard des Capucines_.\r\n\r\nThe second specimen is intended for the ladies, who may believe what\r\nthey like of the statement made about its salutary action, and its\r\nadding to the natural beauty:--\r\n\r\n  =La Veloutine=\r\n\r\n  _est une poudre de Riz spéciale\r\n  préparée au bismuth,\r\n  par conséquent\r\n  d’une action salutaire sur la peau.\r\n  Elle est adhérente et invisible,\r\n  aussi donne-t-elle au teint\r\n  une fraîcheur et une beauté naturelles.\r\n  Ch. FAY, inventeur, 9, rue de la Paix._\r\n\r\nOur third refers to something which has been fashionable as long as\r\nthere has been such a thing as fashion, and which is likely to continue\r\ntill _la mode_ itself has an end:--\r\n\r\n  =MARIAGES=\r\n\r\n  DEMANDEZ LE\r\n  =TRAIT D’UNION=\r\n\r\n  RÉPERTOIRE COMPLET ET DISCRET DES\r\n  DEMANDES ET PROPOSITIONS\r\n  DE TOUS PAYS, ADRESSÉES A\r\n  M. et à M^{me} ROULARD, 72, rue de Rivoli.\r\n\r\n  =DOTS DEPUIS 10,000 FR.\r\n  Jusqu’aux plus grandes fortunes.=\r\n\r\n  (Timbres pour réponse.)\r\n\r\nOur fourth selection refers to a stomachic which is rather fashionable\r\njust now:--\r\n\r\n  _Saint Raphaël_, _vin fortifiant_, _digestif_, Tonique reconstituant,\r\n  goût excellent, plus efficace, pour les personnes affaiblies, que les\r\n  ferrugineux, que les quinas. Prescrit dans les fatigues d’estomac, la\r\n  chlorose, l’anémie, les convalescences.

The announcement that “la Censure a\r\ninterdit ‘Palotte’ dans les gares” has caused “Palotte,” a rather dirty\r\nnovel, to be an immense success. Why it should be forbidden in the\r\nrailway stations, and allowed everywhere else, we are not sufficiently\r\nbehind the scenes to say.\r\n\r\nWe have now glanced hastily at the leading aspects of French\r\nadvertising, and after remarking that _Galignani_ and the _Gazette des\r\nEtrangers_ are the great mediums for English and American advertisements\r\nin Paris, that a certain American manager who has a theatre in London\r\nadvertises it and his angular histrionic wonder regularly in the former,\r\nand that the principal advertising contractors of Paris have made vast\r\nfortunes, we get fairly back to our original remark, that the whole\r\nsystem of advertising in Paris is characteristic of the Parisians--a\r\nstrange mixture of neatness, effect, frivolity, and childishness. Who\r\nshall deny that these four words suit the character of the great mass of\r\nthe people? The fact that the authorities reserve to themselves the\r\nwhite _affiche_ is characteristic to a degree of French Governments, and\r\nthe savage attack which the French journals made upon the letters of\r\napartments, because their poor little notices “Chambre à louer” were\r\nexempted from the ten-centimes tax, was a fair specimen of the frivolous\r\nand vexatious spirit which animates the children of _la Grande Nation_.\r\nFor their neatness they are proverbial; and any one walking through the\r\nstreets of Paris cannot fail to notice the admirable order in which the\r\nvarious stations are kept. No rain-soaked bills peeling off, no\r\nmud-plashed announcements of pieces which have been withdrawn for\r\nweeks--all is neat and fresh, and corrected to date. The gay colours of\r\nthe posters, the many-tinted sides of the _kiosques_, the illuminated\r\n“spectacle” columns, the gilt-lettered balconies, the quaint gas\r\ndevices, and the thousand-and-one pretty and ingenious ideas which are\r\npressed into the service of the modern goddess Publicity, are all items\r\nin one lovely and harmonious whole, the most beautiful and the\r\nbest-arranged city of modern times, Paris. We can teach France many\r\nthings, probably she can teach us one certainly--which is, that art,\r\neven genius, may be successfully applied to such a very small pursuit as\r\nthat of advertising.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of _réclames_, which are now regarded as so\r\nessentially French, has reminded us, not alone that they were\r\nfashionable, though under a humbler name, in this country many, many\r\nyears ago, as we have already shown, but that they are again coming into\r\nfashion. But the “puff-pars” of old England--which may fairly be\r\nrepresented by those which emanated from the establishment of Rowland,\r\nthe Kalydor man, in his palmy days of advertising--were always clumsy\r\nwhen compared with those _réclames_ we have been studying, it being\r\nimpossible, apparently, to make a British advertiser understand that an\r\nadvertisement is more valuable in proportion as it looks less like what\r\nit really is. The cloven foot always shows forth under the wrapper of\r\nfine words; and when we say this, we do not refer to the paragraphs\r\nwritten in odonto or ointment establishments by young men at a pound a\r\nweek, who are bound to put so many hard words in a line, and keep their\r\nproductions within the compass of so many lines, whether syntax is\r\nagreeable or not; but to the friendly and more able notices which now\r\nand again find their way into some daily and weekly papers. The\r\n_réclame_, in its best form, is a highly-cultivated flower--an exotic,\r\nin fact--and is at present a little over the heads of the advertising\r\npublic, who like to see plenty for money.\r\n\r\nOne paragraph which approaches much nearer the true _réclame_ than most\r\nattempts, we stumbled across the other day. It is an attempt to convey\r\nto a wondering world how Perry Davis’s Pain Killer came to be used both\r\ninternally and externally. By it we find that much internal discomfiture\r\nhad been destroyed by the specific, when one day, in conducting some\r\nscientific exploration, its patentee became sadly burned. In his agony\r\nhe threw the contents of the nearest bottle--which happened to contain\r\nPain Killer--over the injured parts, and as much to his surprise as\r\nsatisfaction, he became in a short time perfectly cured. Of a rather\r\nmore ambitious kind is an attempt made by Messrs Piesse and Lubin in the\r\nsame direction. It is quite unique, and deserves a place here. At all\r\nevents we came upon it in a fashionable morning paper, and read some\r\nlittle way before noticing that we were deep in an advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  On Tuesday evening Countess Wallflower resumed her usual assemblies\r\n  after the recess, at her residence in the Laboratory of Flowers. Among\r\n  the members of the diplomatic corps present were the Ambassadors from\r\n  the principal Gardens of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, Muskrosa\r\n  Bey, from the Hanging Garden of Persia, Mdlles. Muskrosabud, Otto\r\n  Rose, Ambassador from the Balkan and Adrionople Flower Farms, the\r\n  Countess Hoya Bella, Madame Mignionette, Magnolia Fulgans, the Florida\r\n  Ambassador, the Countess Flagrant Orchids, the Italian Minister, the\r\n  Countess Bergamotte, Mdlle. Neroli the Mexican Minister and the\r\n  Marchioness de Vanille, the Brazilian Minister and the Odorous\r\n  Opoponax. The general circle comprised, among others, the Princesses\r\n  Jessamine, Violet, Tuberose, the Viscount Stephanotis, and the\r\n  Marchioness of May Blossom. Previous to the assembly the Countess and\r\n  the Right Hon. Sir Scented Stock received at dinner the Duke of\r\n  Frangipanni and a select party. The company separated by midnight, and\r\n  rose in the morning more fragrant than ever.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to mention here that Messrs Piesse and Lubin claim to\r\nbe the originators of the enigmatical form of advertising. It was they\r\nwho started the “Opoponax” mystery, which aroused public curiosity at\r\nthe time, and has been considerably imitated since. Localities are\r\nsometimes used in advertisements as typifying the quality of the\r\narticles advertised; Mayfair Sherry is the chief representative of this\r\nclass, and we suppose that the district is named as evidence of high\r\ntone and elegant bottling. Still another kind of advertising is that\r\nadopted by Brinsmead, who seems to be a regular champion among\r\npianoforte-makers, and who makes curious little extracts bracketed\r\nopposite the names of papers and celebrities that give him\r\ntestimonials, throughout a long newspaper column, all about his patent\r\ncheck repeater-action gold medal pianofortes. Sir Julius Benedict, the\r\n_Examiner_, Brinley Richards, the _Standard_, and Sydney Smith are among\r\nmany other men and papers quoted. We are not aware who Sydney Smith may\r\nbe nowadays, but should hardly think the great wit and essayist who died\r\nthirty years ago could have known enough about Brinsmead’s pianos to\r\nenable him to say “their touch is absolute perfection.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all that has been written and said about the value of\r\nnewspaper notices as distinguished from advertisements, there is no\r\nreasonable room for doubt that a representative of the general\r\nadvertising class would far sooner see his shop paraded in a pantomime,\r\nor hear himself referred to by a low comedian, than be recipient of\r\nreally valuable attention at the hands of a newspaper writer. There are,\r\nof course, exceptions, and these reap the reward their rivals despise.\r\nThe elder Mathews was a victim to the rather illogical rage for that\r\nphase of theatrical advertisement to which we have just referred.\r\nAmongst the extraordinary effects of his popularity, were applications\r\nmade under every kind of pretext, letters being sent to him from all\r\nsorts of professors and tradesmen about town. One man offered him snuff\r\nfor himself and friends for ever, if he would only mention the name and\r\nshop of the manufacturer. Another promised him a perpetual polish for\r\nhis boots upon the same terms. He was solicited to mention every sort of\r\nexhibition, and to puff all the new quack medicines. The wines sent to\r\nhim to taste, though alleged to be of the finest quality, nevertheless\r\nrequired “a bush,” which was to be hung out nightly at his “house of\r\nentertainment.” Patent filters, wigs and waistcoats, boots and\r\nboothooks, “ventilating hats” and “bosom friends,” all gifts, used to\r\nstock Mathews’s lumber-room. An advertising dentist one day presented\r\nhimself, offering to find Mathews’s whole family in new teeth, and draw\r\nall the old, if the comedian would only in return draw the new patent\r\nmineral masticators into notice. In fact, Mathews was so inundated with\r\npresents, that his cottage sometimes looked like a bazaar, and his wife\r\nhad frequently occasion to exercise her ingenuity in contriving how to\r\ndispose of the generally useless articles forced upon their acceptance.\r\n\r\nThough this was a great many years ago, things remain much the same, and\r\nsuch popular entertainers as Fred Maccabe, and patterers as J. L. Toole,\r\ncould doubtless sell themselves for large sums in the interests of vocal\r\nadvertising. Managers invariably avail themselves of the opportunity\r\nwhenever a chance occurs, as it does now and again in realistic drama,\r\nand very frequently in pantomime. Actors are, though, not alone the\r\nadmiration of the advertiser--they are by no means above making a shrewd\r\nbid for popularity themselves by means of the papers. It is not so very\r\nlong ago that a tragedian, more distinguished in the provinces than in\r\nLondon, and anxious to meet that metropolitan recognition which he felt\r\nsure he deserved, gave a small _récherché_ banquet to his early friends\r\nat a well-known house near Lincoln’s-Inn Fields. Those who were invited\r\nmust have felt very much like Mr Twemlow used whenever he visited the\r\nVeneerings, and those who were in a condition to think when they came\r\naway must have felt puzzled to account for the fact that all Mr ----’s\r\nearly friends had taken to the dramatic-critic, the leader-writer, or\r\nthe editor line of business--all but one, a kind of literary tradesman,\r\nwho, however, possibly paid his half for the privilege of being admitted\r\ninto such splendid society on equal terms, and who had, moreover, made\r\nout the list of diners, written the invitations, and maybe provided some\r\nof the clean linen. We tell the story as it was told us by two of the\r\ninvited early friends, who added, that until the night of the dinner\r\nthey had never seen Mr ---- off the stage.\r\n\r\nTaking a long stride from London to a Chinese seaport, we come upon\r\nthis choice sample of Flowery Land English:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ‮祥泰隆記‬\r\n\r\n  Chong thie Loong kee.\r\n\r\n  Most humbly beg leave to acqu\r\n  : aint the Gentlemen trading to\r\n  this kort that the above mention\r\n  : ed chop has been long established\r\n  dnd is much esteemed for its Black\r\n  and young Hyson Tea but fearing\r\n  the foreigners might be cheated by tho\r\n  : se shumeless persons who forged this\r\n  chop he therefore take the liberty to\r\n  pallish these few lines for its\r\n  remark and trust.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo those who are interested in a peculiarity of advertising unknown in\r\nthis country, we present the following from the _Berlinische Zeitung_:--\r\n\r\n  ^~Verlobungen~.^\r\n\r\n  ^Als Verlobte empfehlen sich^\r\n\r\n  ^~Minna Bock~,^\r\n\r\n  ^~Fritz Engelhardt~.^\r\n\r\n  ^Berlin, den 13. März 1872.^\r\n\r\nWhich informs us, under the head of Betrothal, that Minna Bock and Fritz\r\nEngelhardt beg to announce their betrothal, with compliments. The date\r\nis plain. Another announcement in the same paper, and under the same\r\nhead, is this:--\r\n\r\n  ^Die Verlobung unserer ältesten Tochter ~Margarethe~ mit dem\r\n  kaiserlichen Post-Inspektor Herrn Richard ~Raab~ in Magdeburg beehren\r\n  wir uns ergebenst anzuzeigen.^\r\n\r\n  ^Stendal, im März 1872.^\r\n\r\n  Dr. ^~Goldscheider~ nebst Frau.^\r\n\r\n  ^Margarethe ~Goldscheider~,\r\n  Richard ~Raab~,\r\n  Verlobte.^\r\n\r\n  ^Stendal und Magdeburg.^\r\n\r\nWhich means that Dr Goldscheider and his wife do themselves the honour\r\nof most humbly announcing the betrothal of their eldest daughter,\r\nMargaret, to Herr Richard Raab, of Magdeburg, Inspector of the Imperial\r\nPost. Then follow the signatures of bride and groom, and the whole winds\r\nup with the happy conjunction of the two towns, Stendal and Magdeburg.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Journal do Commercio_ of Rio de Janeiro, April 4, 1872, we\r\ntake the following:--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  Fugio da rua da Alfandega n. 297 o preto Mariano, crioulo, estatura\r\n  regular, rosto compride, pouca barba, com falta de dentes na frente,\r\n  tem uma fistula debaixo do queixo, costuma trocar o nome,\r\n  des-confia-se que fosse para os lados de Nitherohy e tem signaes de\r\n  ser surrado nas costas; quem o apprehender e levar á rua e numero\r\n  acima ser á gratificado, e protesta-se contra quem o tiver acoutado.\r\n\r\nCredulous persons, who believe that with the cessation of the war\r\nbetween the Northern and Southern States of America slavery went right\r\nout of existence, except amongst the most barbarous nations, may be\r\nastonished to discover that the foregoing, when turned into English,\r\nreads thus:--“Ran away from 297 Alfandega Street, the negro Mariano, a\r\nhalf-caste of ordinary stature, long visage, slight beard, has lost some\r\nfront teeth, and has an ulcer in the lower jaw. He is accustomed to\r\nchange his name, and is believed to be in the outskirts of Nitherohy. He\r\nhas marks of flogging on his back. Whoever captures him, and brings him\r\nto the above address, will be rewarded, and persons are hereby cautioned\r\nagainst harbouring him.”\r\n\r\nFrom the same paper we extract another announcement:--\r\n\r\n  Antonio Luiz Fernandes da Cunha e sua mulher D. Manoela Pereira\r\n  Fernandes da Cunha, Leopoldino José da Cunha e sua mulher D. Balbina\r\n  Alves Pereira da Cunha, convidão ás pessoas de sua amizade para\r\n  acompanhar o enterro de seu querido filho e neto o innocente Carlos,\r\n  que ha de sepultarse hoje, ás 10½ horas da manhã, no cemiterio de S.\r\n  João Baptista, sahindo o corpo da rua da Bella-Vista n. 3, no Rio\r\n  Comprido.\r\n\r\nWhich means that Antonio Luiz Fernandez da Cunha and his wife, Donna\r\nManoela Pereira Fernandes da Cunha, Leopoldino José da Cunha and his\r\nwife, Donna Balbina Alves Pereira da Cunha, invite their friends to\r\naccompany the funeral of their lamented son and grandson, the innocent\r\nCarlos, who will be buried to-day at half-past ten in the morning, in\r\nthe Cemetery of St John the Baptist. The place of rendezvous concludes\r\nthe melancholy announcement.\r\n\r\nFuneral advertisements seem very popular in Rio, the following being\r\nextracted from among a large number of similar announcements in the\r\n_Journal do Commercio_:--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  D. Joanna da Silva Maia da Conceição e Procopio de Jesus cordialmente\r\n  agradecem ás pessoas que fizerão o caridoso obsequio de acompanhar os\r\n  restos mortaes de seu muito prezado esposo e compadre Olegario da\r\n  Silva; e de novo rogão ás mesmas pessoas e aos amigos do mesmo finado\r\n  para assistir à missa de sentimo dia, que se ha de celebrar, amanhã 5\r\n  do corrente, na matriz de Sant’Anna, ás 8 horas; pelo que desde já se\r\n  confessão summamente gratos.\r\n\r\nThis is from Donna Joanna da Silva Maia da Conceição and Procopio de\r\nJesus, who cordially thank those friends that performed the charitable\r\noffice of following to the grave the mortal remains of their very dear\r\nhusband and godfather, Olegario da Silva. Those and others are again\r\nrequested to attend the seventh-day mass, which is to be performed on\r\nthe morrow, in the mother church of St Anna, at eight o’clock, for which\r\nattendance the advertisers will be very thankful. There are so many of\r\nthese notices, all of which are evidently looked forward to with\r\ninterest, that the reader cannot help thinking a particularly healthy\r\nseason in Rio would be regarded as quite a public misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRINTED BY BALLANTYNE AND COMPANY\r\n\r\n  EDINBURGH AND LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOKS PUBLISHED BY CHATTO & WINDUS._\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Post-Office Orders payable_\r\n  _at Piccadilly Circus._]\r\n\r\n  [NOVEMBER, 1874.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  ^A List of Books^\r\n\r\n  PUBLISHED BY\r\n  CHATTO & WINDUS,\r\n  _74 & 75, PICCADILLY, LONDON, W._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n  SUMPTUOUS GIFT-BOOK.\r\n\r\n  THE TURNER GALLERY:\r\n  A Series of Sixty Engravings,\r\n  From the Principal Works of JOSEPH MALLORD WILLIAM TURNER.\r\n  _With a Memoir and Illustrative Text_\r\n\r\n  By RALPH NICHOLSON WORNUM,\r\n  KEEPER AND SECRETARY, NATIONAL GALLERY.\r\n\r\n  Handsomely half-bound, India Proofs, Royal folio, £10; LARGE PAPER\r\n  copies, Artists’ India Proofs, Elephant folio, £20.\r\n\r\n  _A Descriptive Pamphlet will be sent upon application._\r\n\r\n\r\n  =THE NATIONAL GALLERY:=\r\n\r\n  A Selection from its Pictures,\r\n\r\n  By CLAUDE, REMBRANDT, CUYP, Sir DAVID WILKIE, CORREGGIO, GAINSBOROUGH,\r\n  CANALETTI, VANDYCK, PAUL VERONESE, CARACCI, RUBENS, N. and G.

Considered merely\r\n  as a composition, it deserves to be classed among the best specimens\r\n  of English prose which our age has produced. It contains, indeed, no\r\n  single passage equal to two or three which we could select from the\r\n  Life of Sheridan; but, as a whole, it is immeasurably superior to that\r\n  work. The style is agreeable, clear, and manly, and, when it rises\r\n  into eloquence, rises without effort or ostentation. Nor is the matter\r\n  inferior to the manner. It would be difficult to name a book which\r\n  exhibits more kindness, fairness, and modesty. It has evidently been\r\n  written, not for the purpose of showing--what, however, it often\r\n  shows--how well its author can write, but for the purpose of\r\n  vindicating, as far as truth will permit, the memory of a celebrated\r\n  man who can no longer vindicate himself. Mr. Moore never thrusts\r\n  himself between Lord Byron and the public. With the strongest\r\n  temptations to egotism, he has said no more about himself than the\r\n  subject absolutely required. A great part, indeed the greater part, of\r\n  these volumes consists of extracts from the Letters and Journals of\r\n  Lord Byron; and it is difficult to speak too highly of the skill which\r\n  has been shown in the selection and arrangement.... It is impossible,\r\n  on a general survey, to deny that the task has been executed with\r\n  great judgment and great humanity. When we consider the life which\r\n  Lord Byron had led, his petulance, his irritability, and his\r\n  communicativeness, we cannot but admire the dexterity with which Mr.\r\n  Moore has contrived to exhibit so much of the character and opinions\r\n  of his friend, with so little pain to the feelings of the\r\n  living.”--LORD MACAULAY, in the _Edinburgh Review_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Carols of Cockayne=; Vers de Société descriptive of London Life.

The First Part is just\r\n  ready._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  IN collecting materials for a History of Costume of more importance\r\n  than the little handbook which has met with so much favour as an\r\n  elementary work, I was not only made aware of my own deficiencies, but\r\n  surprised to find how much more vague are the explanations, and\r\n  contradictory the statements, of our best authorities, than they\r\n  appeared to me, when, in the plenitude of my ignorance, I rushed upon\r\n  almost untrodden ground, and felt bewildered by the mass of unsifted\r\n  evidence and unhesitating assertion which met my eyes at every turn.\r\n\r\n  During the forty years which have elapsed since the publication of the\r\n  first edition of my “History of British Costume” in the “Library of\r\n  Entertaining Knowledge,” archæological investigation has received such\r\n  an impetus by the establishment of metropolitan and provincial\r\n  peripatetic antiquarian societies, that a flood of light has been\r\n  poured upon us, by which we are enabled to re-examine our opinions and\r\n  discover reasons to doubt, if we cannot find facts to authenticate.\r\n\r\n  That the former greatly preponderate is a grievous acknowledgment to\r\n  make after assiduously devoting the leisure of half my life to the\r\n  pursuit of information on this, to me, most fascinating subject. It is\r\n  some consolation, however, to feel that where I cannot instruct, I\r\n  shall certainly not mislead, and that the reader will find, under each\r\n  head, all that is known to, or suggested by, the most competent\r\n  writers I am acquainted with, either here or on the Continent.\r\n\r\n  That this work appears in a glossarial form arises from the desire of\r\n  many artists, who have expressed to me the difficulty they constantly\r\n  meet with in their endeavours to ascertain the complete form of a\r\n  garment, or the exact mode of fastening a piece of armour, or buckling\r\n  of a belt, from their study of a sepulchral effigy or a figure in an\r\n  illumination; the attitude of the personages represented, or the\r\n  disposition of other portions of their attire, effectually preventing\r\n  the requisite examination.\r\n\r\n  The books supplying any such information are very few, and the best\r\n  confined to armour or ecclesiastical costume. The only English\r\n  publication of the kind required, that I am aware of, is the late Mr.\r\n  Fairholt’s “Costume in England” (8vo, London, 1846), the last two\r\n  hundred pages of which contain a glossary, the most valuable portion\r\n  whereof are the quotations from old plays, mediæval romances, and\r\n  satirical ballads, containing allusions to various articles of attire\r\n  in fashion at the time of their composition. Twenty-eight years have\r\n  expired since that book appeared, and it has been thought that a more\r\n  comprehensive work on the subject than has yet issued from the English\r\n  press, combining the pith of the information of many costly foreign\r\n  publications, and, in its illustrations, keeping in view the special\r\n  requirement of the artist, to which I have alluded, would be, in these\r\n  days of educational progress and critical inquiry, a welcome addition\r\n  to the library of an English gentleman.\r\n\r\n  J.

Crown 8vo, cloth\r\n  extra, pp. 540, 12_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Swinburne’s most prejudiced critic cannot, we think, deny that\r\n  ‘Bothwell’ is a poem of a very high character. Every line bears traces\r\n  of power, individuality, and vivid imagination. The versification,\r\n  while characteristically supple and melodious, also attains, in spite\r\n  of some affectations, to a sustained strength and dignity of a\r\n  remarkable kind. Mr. Swinburne is not only a master of the music of\r\n  language, but he has that indescribable touch which discloses the true\r\n  poet--the touch that lifts from off the ground.”--_Saturday Review._\r\n\r\n  “It is not too much to say that, should he never write anything more,\r\n  the poet has by this work firmly established his position, and given\r\n  us a poem upon which his fame may safely rest. He no longer indulges\r\n  in that frequent alliteration, or that oppressive wealth of imagery\r\n  and colour, which gave rhythm and splendour to some of his works, but\r\n  would have been out of place in a grand historical poem; we have now a\r\n  fair opportunity of judging what the poet can do when deprived of such\r\n  adventitious aid,--and the verdict is, that he must henceforth rank\r\n  amongst the first of British authors.”--_Graphic._\r\n\r\n  “The whole drama flames and rings with high passions and great deeds.\r\n  The imagination is splendid; the style large and imperial; the insight\r\n  into character keen; the blank verse varied, sensitive, flexible,\r\n  alive. Mr. Swinburne has once more proved his right to occupy a seat\r\n  among the lofty singers of our land.”--_Daily News._\r\n\r\n  “A really grand, statuesque dramatic work.... The reader will here\r\n  find Mr. Swinburne at his very best, if manliness, dignity, and\r\n  fulness of style are superior to mere pleasant singing and\r\n  alliterative lyrics.”--_Standard._\r\n\r\n  “Splendid pictures, subtle analyses of passion, and wonderful studies\r\n  of character will repay him who attains the end.... In this huge\r\n  volume are many fine and some unsurpassable things. Subtlest traits of\r\n  character abound, and descriptive passages of singular\r\n  delicacy.”--_Athenæum._\r\n\r\n  “There can be no doubt of the dramatic force of the poem. It is\r\n  severely simple in its diction, and never dull; there are innumerable\r\n  fine touches on almost every page.”--_Scotsman._\r\n\r\n  “‘Bothwell’ shows us Mr. Swinburne at a point immeasurably superior to\r\n  any that he has yet achieved. It will confirm and increase the\r\n  reputation which his daring genius has already won. He has handled a\r\n  difficult subject with a mastery of art which is a true intellectual\r\n  triumph.”--_Hour._\r\n\r\n  =Chastelard=: A Tragedy.

A full-length Portrait of\r\n  each King, whose Charter is given--including Edward III., when young,\r\n  and again at an advanced age--adorns the margin. These Portraits, with\r\n  the exception of four which are smaller, and on one sheet of vellum,\r\n  vary from eight to nine inches in length--some in armour, and some in\r\n  robes of state. In addition to these are Portraits of an Archbishop in\r\n  full canonicals, of a Chancellor, and of many of the chief Burgesses\r\n  of the City of Waterford, as well as singularly curious Portraits of\r\n  the Mayors of Dublin, Waterford, Limerick, and Cork, figured for the\r\n  most part in the quaint bipartite costume of the Second Richard’s\r\n  reign, though partaking of many of the peculiarities of that of Edward\r\n  III. Altogether this ancient work of art is unique of its kind in\r\n  Ireland, and deserves to be rescued from oblivion, by the publication\r\n  of the unedited Charters, and of fac-similes of all the Illuminations.\r\n  The production of such a work would throw much light on the question\r\n  of the art and social habits of the Anglo-Norman settlers in Ireland\r\n  at the close of the fourteenth century. The Charters are, many of\r\n  them, highly important from an historic point of view._\r\n\r\n  _The Illuminations have been accurately traced and coloured for the\r\n  work from a copy carefully made, by permission of the Mayor and\r\n  Corporation of Waterford, by the late George V. Du Noyer, Esq.,\r\n  M.R.I.A.; and those Charters which have not already appeared in print\r\n  will be edited by the Rev. James Graves, A.B., M.R.I.A., Hon.\r\n  Secretary Kilkenny and South-East of Ireland Archæological Society._\r\n\r\n  _The Work will be brought out in the best manner, with embossed cover\r\n  and characteristic title-page; and it will be put to press as soon as\r\n  250 subscribers are obtained. The price, in imperial 4to, is 20s. to\r\n  subscribers, or 30s. to non-subscribers._\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Wonderful Characters=: Memoirs and Anecdotes of Remarkable and\r\n  Eccentric Persons of Every Age and Nation. From the text of HENRY\r\n  WILSON and JAMES CAULFIELD. Crown 8vo, cloth extra, with Sixty-one\r\n  full-page Engravings of Extraordinary Persons, 7_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n  ⁂ _There are so many curious matters discussed in this volume, that\r\n  any person who takes it up will not readily lay it down until he has\r\n  read it through. The Introduction is almost entirely devoted to a\r\n  consideration of Pig-Faced Ladies, and the various stories concerning\r\n  them._\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Wright’s (Andrew) Court-Hand Restored=; or, Student’s Assistant in\r\n  Reading Old Deeds, Charters, Records, &c. Half Morocco, a New Edition,\r\n  10_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n  ⁂ _The best guide to the reading of old Records, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Wright’s Caricature History of the Georges= (House of Hanover). With\r\n  400 Pictures, Caricatures, Squibs, Broadsides, Window Pictures, &c. By\r\n  THOMAS WRIGHT, Esq., M.A., F.S.A. Crown 8vo, cloth extra, 7_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  “A set of caricatures such as we have in Mr. Wright’s volume brings\r\n  the surface of the age before us with a vividness that no prose\r\n  writer, even of the highest power, could emulate. Macaulay’s most\r\n  brilliant sentence is weak by the side of the little woodcut from\r\n  Gillray, which gives us Burke and Fox.”--_Saturday Review._\r\n\r\n  “A more amusing work of its kind was never issued.”--_Art Journal._\r\n\r\n  “It is emphatically one of the liveliest of books, as also one of the\r\n  most interesting. It has the twofold merit of being at once amusing\r\n  and edifying.”--_Morning Post._\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Yankee Drolleries=, Edited by G. A. SALA.
