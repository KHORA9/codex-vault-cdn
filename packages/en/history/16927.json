At this point\r\nhe closed his public career. He had reached the goal of a politician's\r\nambition and had become known as one of the best speakers of his time,\r\nbut he seems to have realized that under the Principate politics was a\r\ndull farce, and that oratory was of little value in a time of peace\r\nand strong government. The rest of his life was to be spent in writing\r\nhistory. In the year of his consulship or immediately after it, he\r\npublished the _Agricola_ and _Germania_, short monographs in which he\r\npractised the transition from the style of the speaker to that of the\r\nwriter. In the preface to the _Agricola_ he foreshadows the larger\r\nwork on which he is engaged. 'I shall find it a pleasant task to put\r\ntogether, though in rough and unfinished style, a memorial of our\r\nformer slavery and a record of our present happiness.' His intention\r\nwas to write a history of the Principate from Augustus to Trajan. He\r\nbegan with his own times, and wrote in twelve or fourteen books a full\r\naccount of the period from Nero's death in 68 A.D. to the death of\r\nDomitian in 96 A.D. These were published, probably in successive\r\nbooks, between 106 and 109 A.D. Only the first four and a half books\r\nsurvive to us. They deal with the years 69 and 70, and are known as\r\n_The Histories_. _The Annals_, which soon followed, dealt with the\r\nJulian dynasty after the death of Augustus. Of Augustus' constitution\r\nof the principate and of Rome's 'present happiness' under Trajan,\r\nTacitus did not live to write.\r\n\r\n_The Histories_, as they survive to us, describe in a style that has\r\nmade them immortal one of the most terrible and crucial moments of\r\nRoman history. The deadly struggle for the throne demonstrated finally\r\nthe real nature of the Principate--based not on constitutional\r\nfictions but on armed force--and the supple inefficiency of the\r\nsenatorial class. The revolt on the Rhine foreshadowed the debacle of\r\nthe fifth century. Tacitus was peculiarly well qualified to write the\r\nhistory of this period. He had been the eye-witness of some of the\r\nmost terrible scenes: he was acquainted with all the distinguished\r\nsurvivors: his political experience gave him a statesman's point of\r\nview, and his rhetorical training a style which mirrored both the\r\nterror of the times and his own emotion. More than any other Roman\r\nhistorian he desired to tell the truth and was not fatally biassed by\r\nprejudice. It is wrong to regard Tacitus as an 'embittered\r\nrhetorician', an 'enemy of the Empire', a 'détracteur de\r\nl'humanité'.[1] He was none of these. As a member of a noble, though\r\nnot an ancient, family, and as one who had completed the republican\r\n_cursus honorum_, his sympathies were naturally senatorial. He\r\nregretted that the days were passed when oratory was a real power and\r\nthe consuls were the twin towers of the world. But he never hoped to\r\nsee such days again. He realized that monarchy was essential to peace,\r\nand that the price of freedom was violence and disorder. He had no\r\nillusions about the senate. Fault and misfortune had reduced them to\r\nnerveless servility, a luxury of self-abasement. Their meekness would\r\nnever inherit the earth. Tacitus pours scorn on the philosophic\r\nopponents of the Principate, who while refusing to serve the emperor\r\nand pretending to hope for the restoration of the republic, could\r\ncontribute nothing more useful than an ostentatious suicide. His own\r\ncareer, and still more the career of his father-in-law Agricola,\r\nshowed that even under bad emperors a man could be great without\r\ndishonour. Tacitus was no republican in any sense of the word, but\r\nrather a monarchist _malgré lui_. There was nothing for it but to pray\r\nfor good emperors and put up with bad ones.\r\n\r\nThose who decry Tacitus for prejudice against the Empire forget that\r\nhe is describing emperors who were indubitably bad. We have lost his\r\naccount of Vespasian's reign. His praise of Augustus and of Trajan was\r\nnever written. The emperors whom he depicts for us were all either\r\ntyrannical or contemptible, or both: no floods of modern biography can\r\nwash them white. They seemed to him to have degraded Roman life and\r\nleft no room for _virtus_ in the world. The verdict of Rome had gone\r\nagainst them. So he devotes to their portraiture the venom which the\r\nfifteen years of Domitian's reign of terror had engendered in his\r\nheart. He was inevitably a pessimist; his ideals lay in the past; yet\r\nhe clearly shows that he had some hope of the future. Without sharing\r\nPliny's faith that the millennium had dawned, he admits that Nerva and\r\nTrajan have inaugurated 'happier times' and combined monarchy with\r\nsome degree of personal freedom.\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons for the 'dark shadows' in Tacitus' work.\r\nHistory to a Roman was _opus oratorium,_ a work of literary art. Truth\r\nis a great but not a sufficient merit. The historian must be not only\r\n_narrator_ but _ornator rerum_. He must carefully select and arrange\r\nthe incidents, compose them into an effective group, and by the power\r\nof language make them memorable and alive. In these books Tacitus has\r\nlittle but horrors to describe: his art makes them unforgettably\r\nhorrible. The same art is ready to display the beauty of courage and\r\nself-sacrifice. But these were rarer phenomena than cowardice and\r\ngreed. It was not Tacitus, but the age, which showed a preference for\r\nvice. Moreover, the historian's art was not to be used solely for its\r\nown sake. All ancient history was written with a moral object; the\r\nethical interest predominates almost to the exclusion of all others.\r\nTacitus is never merely literary. The [Greek: semnotês] which Pliny\r\nnotes as the characteristic of his oratory, never lets him sparkle to\r\nno purpose. All his pictures have a moral object 'to rescue virtue\r\nfrom oblivion and restrain vice by the terror of posthumous\r\ninfamy'.[2] His prime interest is character: and when he has\r\nconducted some skilful piece of moral diagnosis there attaches to his\r\nverdict some of the severity of a sermon. If you want to make men\r\nbetter you must uncover and scarify their sins.\r\n\r\nFew Christian moralists deal much in eulogy, and Tacitus' diatribes\r\nare the more frequent and the more fierce because his was the morality\r\nnot of Christ but of Rome. 'The Poor' are as dirt to him: he can stoop\r\nto immortalize some gleam of goodness in low life, but even then his\r\nmain object is by scorn of contrast to galvanize the aristocracy into\r\nbetter ways. Only in them can true _virtus_ grow. Their degradation\r\nseems the death of goodness. Tacitus had little sympathy with the\r\nsocial revolution that was rapidly completing itself, not so much\r\nbecause those who rose from the masses lacked 'blood', but because\r\nthey had not been trained in the right traditions. In the decay of\r\nEducation he finds a prime cause of evil. And being a Roman--wherever\r\nhe may have been born--he inevitably feels that the decay of Roman\r\nlife must rot the world. His eyes are not really open to the Empire.\r\nHe never seems to think that in the spacious provinces to which the\r\nold Roman virtues had taken flight, men were leading happy, useful\r\nlives, because the strong hand of the imperial government had come to\r\nsave them from the inefficiency of aristocratic governors. This\r\nnarrowness of view accounts for much of Tacitus' pessimism.\r\n\r\nRecognition of the atmosphere in which Tacitus wrote and the objects\r\nat which his history aimed helps one to understand why it sometimes\r\ndisappoints modern expectations. Particular scenes are seared on our\r\nmemories: persons stand before us lit to the soul by a fierce light of\r\npsychological analysis: we learn to loath the characteristic vices of\r\nthe time, and to understand the moral causes of Roman decadence. But\r\nsomehow the dominance of the moral interest and the frequent\r\ninterruption of the narrative by scenes of senatorial inefficiency\r\nserve to obscure the plain sequence of events. It is difficult after a\r\nfirst reading of the _Histories_ to state clearly what happened in\r\nthese two years. And this difficulty is vastly annoying to experts who\r\nwish to trace the course of the three campaigns. Those whose interest\r\nis not in Tacitus but in the military history of the period are\r\nrecommended to study Mr. B.W. Henderson's _Civil War and Rebellion in\r\nthe Roman Empire_, a delightful book which makes the dark places\r\nplain. But they are not recommended to share his contempt for Tacitus\r\nbecause his accounts of warfare are as bad as, for instance,\r\nShakespeare's. Tacitus does not describe in detail the tactics and\r\ngeography of a campaign, perhaps because he could not do so, certainly\r\nbecause he did not wish to. He regarded such details as dry bones,\r\nwhich no amount of literary skill could animate. His interest is in\r\nhuman character. Plans of campaign throw little light on that: so they\r\ndid not interest him, or, if they did, he suppressed his interest\r\nbecause he knew that his public would otherwise behave as Dr. Johnson\r\ndid when Fox talked to him of Catiline's conspiracy. 'He withdrew his\r\nattention and thought about Tom Thumb.'\r\n\r\nThere is no worse fault in criticism than to blame a work of art for\r\nlacking qualities to which it makes no pretension. Tacitus is not a\r\n'bad military historian'. He is not a 'military' historian at all.\r\nBotticelli is not a botanist, nor is Shakespeare a geographer. It is\r\nthis fault which leads critics to call Tacitus 'a stilted pleader at a\r\ndecadent bar', and to complain that his narrative of the war with\r\nCivilis is 'made dull and unreal by speeches'--because they have not\r\nfound in Tacitus what they had no right to look for. Tacitus inserts\r\nspeeches for the same reason that he excludes tactical details. They\r\nadd to the human interest of his work. They give scope to his great\r\ndramatic powers, to that passionate sympathy with character which\r\nfinds expression in a style as nervous as itself. They enable him to\r\ndisplay motives, to appraise actions, to reveal moral forces. It is\r\ninterest in human nature rather than pride of rhetoric which makes him\r\nlove a good debate.\r\n\r\nThe supreme distinction of Tacitus is, of course, his style. That is\r\nlost in a translation. 'Hard' though his Latin is, it is not obscure.\r\nCareful attention can always detect his exact thought. Like Meredith\r\nhe is 'hard' because he does so much with words. Neither writer leaves\r\nany doubt about his meaning. It is therefore a translator's first duty\r\nto be lucid, and not until that duty is done may he try by faint\r\nflushes of epigram to reflect something of the brilliance of Tacitus'\r\nLatin. Very faint indeed that reflection must always be: probably no\r\naudience could be found to listen to a translation of Tacitus, yet one\r\nfeels that his Latin would challenge and hold the attention of any\r\naudience that was not stone-deaf. But it is because Tacitus is never a\r\nmere stylist that some of us continue in the failure to translate him.\r\nHis historical deductions and his revelations of character have their\r\nvalue for every age. 'This form of history,' says Montaigne, 'is by\r\nmuch the most useful ... there are in it more precepts than stories:\r\nit is not a book to read, 'tis a book to study and learn: 'tis full of\r\nsententious opinions, right or wrong: 'tis a nursery of ethic and\r\npolitic discourses, for the use and ornament of those who have any\r\nplace in the government of the world.... His pen seems most proper for\r\na troubled and sick state, as ours at present is; you would often say\r\nit is us he paints and pinches.' Sir Henry Savile, Warden of Merton\r\nand Provost of Eton, who translated the _Histories_ into racy\r\nElizabethan English at a time when the state was neither 'troubled'\r\nnor 'sick' is as convinced as Montaigne or the theorists of the French\r\nRevolution that Tacitus had lessons for his age. 'In Galba thou maiest\r\nlearne, that a Good Prince gouerned by evill ministers is as dangerous\r\nas if he were evill himselfe. By Otho, that the fortune of a rash man\r\nis _Torrenti similis_, which rises at an instant, and falles in a\r\nmoment. By Vitellius, that he that hath no vertue can neuer be happie:\r\nfor by his own baseness he will loose all, which either fortune, or\r\nother mens labours have cast upon him. By Vespasian, that in civill\r\ntumults an advised patience, and opportunitie well taken are the onely\r\nweapons of advantage. In them all, and in the state of Rome under them\r\nthou maiest see the calamities that follow civill warres, where lawes\r\nlie asleepe, and all things are iudged by the sword. If thou mislike\r\ntheir warres be thankfull for thine owne peace; if thou dost abhor\r\ntheir tyrannies, love and reverence thine owne wise, iust and\r\nexcellent Prince.' So whatever guise our age may assume, there are\r\nlessons to be drawn from Tacitus either directly or _per contra_, and\r\nhis translators may be acquitted at a time when Latin scholarship is\r\nno longer an essential of political eminence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [1] Napoleon's phrase.\r\n\r\n     [2] _Ann._ iii. 65.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF CHIEF EVENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Fisher (_Oxford Classical Texts_).\r\nDepartures from it are mentioned in the notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n[A.D. 69.] I propose to begin my narrative with the second               1\r\nconsulship of Servius Galba, in which Titus Vinius was his colleague.\r\nMany historians have dealt with the 820 years of the earlier period\r\nbeginning with the foundation of Rome, and the story of the Roman\r\nRepublic has been told with no less ability than truth. After the\r\nBattle of Actium, when the interests of peace were served by the\r\ncentralization of all authority in the hands of one man, there\r\nfollowed a dearth of literary ability, and at the same time truth\r\nsuffered more and more, partly from ignorance of politics, which were\r\nno longer a citizen's concern, partly from the growing taste for\r\nflattery or from hatred of the ruling house. So between malice on one\r\nside and servility on the other the interests of posterity were\r\nneglected. But historians find that a tone of flattery soon incurs the\r\nstigma of servility and earns for them the contempt of their readers,\r\nwhereas people readily open their ears to the criticisms of envy,\r\nsince malice makes a show of independence. Of Galba, Otho, and\r\nVitellius, I have known nothing either to my advantage or my hurt. I\r\ncannot deny that I originally owed my position to Vespasian, or that I\r\nwas advanced by Titus and still further promoted by Domitian;[5] but\r\nprofessing, as I do, unbiassed honesty, I must speak of no man either\r\nwith hatred or affection. I have reserved for my old age, if life is\r\nspared to me, the reigns of the sainted Nerva and of the Emperor\r\nTrajan, which afford a richer and withal a safer theme:[6] for it is\r\nthe rare fortune of these days that a man may think what he likes and\r\nsay what he thinks.\r\n\r\nThe story I now commence is rich in vicissitudes, grim with              2\r\nwarfare, torn by civil strife, a tale of horror even during times of\r\npeace. It tells of four emperors slain by the sword, three several\r\ncivil wars, an even larger number of foreign wars and some that were\r\nboth at once: successes in the East, disaster in the West, disturbance\r\nin Illyricum, disaffection in the provinces of Gaul, the conquest of\r\nBritain and its immediate loss, the rising of the Sarmatian and Suebic\r\ntribes. It tells how Dacia had the privilege of exchanging blows with\r\nRome, and how a pretender claiming to be Nero almost deluded the\r\nParthians into declaring war. Now too Italy was smitten with new\r\ndisasters, or disasters it had not witnessed for a long period of\r\nyears. Towns along the rich coast of Campania were submerged or\r\nburied. The city was devastated by fires, ancient temples were\r\ndestroyed, and the Capitol itself was fired by Roman hands. Sacred\r\nrites were grossly profaned, and there were scandals in high\r\nplaces.[7] The sea swarmed with exiles and the island cliffs[8] were\r\nred with blood. Worse horrors reigned in the city. To be rich or\r\nwell-born was a crime: men were prosecuted for holding or for refusing\r\noffice: merit of any kind meant certain ruin. Nor were the Informers\r\nmore hated for their crimes than for their prizes: some carried off a\r\npriesthood or the consulship as their spoil, others won offices and\r\ninfluence in the imperial household: the hatred and fear they inspired\r\nworked universal havoc. Slaves were bribed against their masters,\r\nfreedmen against their patrons, and, if a man had no enemies, he was\r\nruined by his friends.\r\n\r\nHowever, the period was not so utterly barren as to yield no             3\r\nexamples of heroism. There were mothers who followed their sons, and\r\nwives their husbands into exile: one saw here a kinsman's courage and\r\nthere a son-in-law's devotion: slaves obstinately faithful even on the\r\nrack: distinguished men bravely facing the utmost straits and matching\r\nin their end the famous deaths of older times. Besides these manifold\r\ndisasters to mankind there were portents in the sky and on the earth,\r\nthunderbolts and other premonitions of good and of evil, some\r\ndoubtful, some obvious. Indeed never has it been proved by such\r\nterrible disasters to Rome or by such clear evidence that Providence\r\nis concerned not with our peace of mind but rather with vengeance for\r\nour sin.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [5] To Vespasian Tacitus probably owed his quaestorship and a\r\n         seat in the senate; to Titus his tribunate of the people; to\r\n         Domitian the praetorship and a 'fellowship' of one of the\r\n         great priestly colleges, whose special function was the\r\n         supervision of foreign cults. This last accounts for Tacitus'\r\n         interest in strange religions.\r\n\r\n     [6] This project, also foreshadowed in _Agricola_ iii, was\r\n         never completed.\r\n\r\n     [7] Referring in particular to the scandals among the Vestal\r\n         Virgins and to Domitian's relations with his niece Julia.\r\n\r\n     [8] i.e. the Aegean islands, such as Seriphus, Gyarus,\r\n         Amorgus, where those in disfavour were banished and often\r\n         murdered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\nBefore I commence my task, it seems best to go back and consider         4\r\nthe state of affairs in the city, the temper of the armies, the\r\ncondition of the provinces, and to determine the elements of strength\r\nand weakness in the different quarters of the Roman world. By this\r\nmeans we may see not only the actual course of events, which is\r\nlargely governed by chance, but also why and how they occurred.\r\n\r\nThe death of Nero, after the first outburst of joy with which it was\r\ngreeted, soon aroused conflicting feelings not only among the\r\nsenators, the people, and the soldiers in the city, but also among the\r\ngenerals and their troops abroad. It had divulged a secret of state:\r\nan emperor could be made elsewhere than at Rome. Still the senate was\r\nsatisfied. They had immediately taken advantage of their liberty and\r\nwere naturally emboldened against a prince who was new to the throne\r\nand, moreover, absent. The highest class of the knights[9] seconded\r\nthe senate's satisfaction. Respectable citizens, who were attached as\r\nclients or freedmen to the great families, and had seen their patrons\r\ncondemned or exiled, now revived their hopes. The lowest classes, who\r\nhad grown familiar with the pleasures of the theatre and the circus,\r\nthe most degraded of the slaves, and Nero's favourites who had\r\nsquandered their property and lived on his discreditable bounty, all\r\nshowed signs of depression and an eager greed for news.\r\n\r\nThe troops in the city[10] had long been inured to the allegiance        5\r\nof the Caesars, and it was more by the pressure of intrigue than of\r\ntheir own inclination that they came to desert Nero. They soon\r\nrealized that the donation promised in Galba's name was not to be paid\r\nto them, and that peace would not, like war, offer opportunity for\r\ngreat services and rich rewards. Since they also saw that the new\r\nemperor's favour had been forestalled by the army which proclaimed\r\nhim, they were ripe for revolution and were further instigated by\r\ntheir rascally Praefect Nymphidius Sabinus, who was plotting to be\r\nemperor himself. His design was as a matter of fact detected and\r\nquashed, but, though the ringleader was removed, many of the troops\r\nstill felt conscious of their treason and could be heard commenting on\r\nGalba's senility and avarice. His austerity--a quality once admired\r\nand set high in soldiers' estimation--only annoyed troops whose\r\ncontempt for the old methods of discipline had been fostered by\r\nfourteen years of service under Nero. They had come to love the\r\nemperors' vices as much as they once reverenced their virtues in older\r\ndays. Moreover Galba had let fall a remark, which augured well for\r\nRome, though it spelt danger to himself. 'I do not buy my soldiers,'\r\nhe said, 'I select them.' And indeed, as things then stood, his words\r\nsounded incongruous.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [9] Probably those who owned one million sesterces, the\r\n         property qualification for admission to the senate.\r\n\r\n    [10] This includes 'The Guards' (_cohortes praetoriae_) and\r\n         'The City Garrison' (_cohortes urbanae_), and possibly also\r\n         the _cohortes vigilum_, who were a sort of police corps and\r\n         fire brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALBA'S POSITION\r\n\r\nGalba was old and ill. Of his two lieutenants Titus Vinius was the       6\r\nvilest of men and Cornelius Laco the laziest. Hated as he was for\r\nVinius' crimes and despised for Laco's inefficiency, between them\r\nGalba soon came to ruin. His march from Spain was slow and stained\r\nwith bloodshed. He executed Cingonius Varro, the consul-elect, and\r\nPetronius Turpilianus, an ex-consul, the former as an accomplice of\r\nNymphidius, the latter as one of Nero's generals. They were both\r\ndenied any opportunity of a hearing or defence--and might as well have\r\nbeen innocent. On his arrival at Rome the butchery of thousands of\r\nunarmed soldiers[11] gave an ill omen to his entry, and alarmed even\r\nthe men who did the slaughter. The city was filled with strange\r\ntroops. A legion had been brought from Spain,[12] and the regiment of\r\nmarines enrolled by Nero still remained.[11] Moreover there were\r\nseveral detachments from Germany, Britain, and Illyricum,[13] which\r\nhad been selected by Nero, dispatched to the Caspian Pass[14] for the\r\nprojected war against the Albanians, and subsequently recalled to aid\r\nin crushing the revolt of Vindex.[15] These were all fine fuel for a\r\nrevolution, and, although their favour centred on nobody in\r\nparticular, there they were at the disposal of any one who had\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nIt happened by chance that the news of the death of Clodius Macer        7\r\nand of Fonteius Capito arrived in Rome simultaneously. Macer,[16] who\r\nwas undoubtedly raising a disturbance in Africa, was put to death by\r\nthe imperial agent Trebonius Garutianus, acting under Galba's orders:\r\nCapito[17] had made a similar attempt in Germany and was killed by two\r\nofficers, Cornelius Aquinus and Fabius Valens, without waiting for\r\ninstructions. While Capito had a foul reputation for extortion and\r\nloose living, some people yet believed that he had withheld his hand\r\nfrom treason. His officers, they supposed, had urged him to declare\r\nwar, and, when they could not persuade him, had gone on to charge him\r\nfalsely with their own offence,[18] while Galba from weakness of\r\ncharacter, or perhaps because he was afraid to inquire too far,\r\napproved what had happened for good or for ill, since it was past\r\nalteration. At any rate both executions were unpopular. Now that Galba\r\nwas disliked, everything he did, whether right or wrong, made him more\r\nunpopular. His freedmen were all-powerful: money could do anything:\r\nthe slaves were thirsting for an upheaval, and with so elderly an\r\nemperor were naturally expecting to see one soon. The evils of the new\r\ncourt were those of the old, and while equally oppressive were not so\r\neasily excused. Even Galba's age seemed comic and despicable to a\r\npopulace that was used to the young Nero and compared the emperors, as\r\nsuch people will, in point of looks and personal attraction.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [11] i.e. the marines, whom Nero had formed into a reserve\r\n         force (Legio I Adiutrix). They had met Galba at the Mulvian\r\n         Bridge, probably with a petition for service in the Line.\r\n\r\n    [12] Legio VII Galbiana, sent later to Pannonia.\r\n\r\n    [13] Illyricum included all the Danube provinces.\r\n\r\n    [14] The Pass of Dariel over the centre of the Caucasus. The\r\n         Albanians lay to the east of its southern end, on the\r\n         south-west coast of the Caspian.\r\n\r\n    [15] Vindex, Pro-praetor in the Lyons division of Gaul, had\r\n         revolted against Nero early in the year 68 and offered his\r\n         support to Galba, then governor of the Tarragona division of\r\n         Spain. He was defeated by Verginius Rufus, commanding the\r\n         forces in Upper Germany, and committed suicide. Verginius\r\n         afterwards declared for Galba, though his troops wanted to\r\n         make him emperor. Cp. chap. 8.\r\n\r\n    [16] Clodius Macer commanded Legio III Augusta and governed\r\n         Numidia, which Tiberius at the end of his reign had detached\r\n         from the pro-consulate of Africa.\r\n\r\n    [17] Governor of Lower Germany. See chap. 58 and iii. 62.\r\n\r\n    [18] Cp. chap. 58.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF FORCES\r\n\r\nSuch then at Rome was the variety of feeling natural in so vast a        8\r\npopulation. To turn to the provinces abroad: Spain was under the\r\ncommand of Cluvius Rufus, a man of great eloquence, and more skilled\r\nin the arts of peace than of war.[19] The Gallic provinces had not\r\nforgotten Vindex: moreover, they were bound to Galba by his recent\r\ngrant of Roman citizenship and his rebate of their tribute for the\r\nfuture. The tribes, however, which lay nearest to the armies stationed\r\nin Germany had not received these honours: some even had lost part of\r\ntheir territory and were equally aggrieved at the magnitude of their\r\nown injuries and of their neighbours' benefits. The troops in Germany\r\nwere proud of their recent victory, indignant at their treatment and\r\nperplexed by a nervous consciousness that they had supported the wrong\r\nside: a very dangerous state for so strong a force to be in. They had\r\nbeen slow to desert Nero, and Verginius[20] did not immediately\r\ndeclare for Galba. Whether he really did not want the throne is\r\ndoubtful: without question his soldiers made him the offer. The death\r\nof Fonteius Capito aroused the indignation even of those who had no\r\nright to complain. However, they still lacked a leader: Galba had sent\r\nfor Verginius under a pretence of friendship, and, when he was not\r\nallowed to return and was even charged with treachery, the soldiers\r\nconsidered his case their own.\r\n\r\nThe army of Upper Germany felt no respect for their commander,           9\r\nHordeonius Flaccus.[21] Weakened by age and an affection of the feet\r\nhe was without resolution or authority, and could not have controlled\r\nthe mildest troops. These fiery spirits were only the further inflamed\r\nwhen they felt such a weak hand on the reins. The legions of Lower\r\nGermany had been for some time without a commander,[22] until Aulus\r\nVitellius appeared. He was the son of the Lucius Vitellius who had\r\nbeen censor and thrice consul,[23] and Galba thought this sufficient\r\nto impress the troops. The army in Britain showed no bad feeling. All\r\nthrough the disturbance of the civil wars no troops kept cleaner\r\nhands. This may have been because they were so far away and severed by\r\nthe sea, or perhaps frequent engagements had taught them to keep their\r\nrancour for the enemy. Quiet ruled in Illyricum also, although the\r\nlegions, which had been summoned by Nero,[24] while lingering in Italy\r\nhad made overtures to Verginius. But the armies lay far apart, always\r\na sound assistance to the maintenance of military discipline, since\r\nthe men could neither share vices nor join forces.\r\n\r\nThe East was still untroubled. Licinius Mucianus held Syria with        10\r\nfour legions.[25] He was a man who was always famous, whether in good\r\nfortune or in bad. As a youth he was ambitious and cultivated the\r\nfriendship of the great. Later he found himself in straitened\r\ncircumstances and a very ambiguous position, and, suspecting Claudius'\r\ndispleasure, he withdrew into the wilds of Asia, where he came as near\r\nto being an exile as afterwards to being an emperor. He was a strange\r\nmixture of good and bad, of luxury and industry, courtesy and\r\narrogance. In leisure he was self-indulgent, but full of vigour on\r\nservice. His outward behaviour was praiseworthy, though ill was spoken\r\nof his private life. However, with those who were under him or near\r\nhim, and with his colleagues he gained great influence by various\r\ndevices, and seems to have been the sort of man who would more readily\r\nmake an emperor than be one.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish war was being conducted by Flavius Vespasianus--appointed\r\nby Nero--with three legions.[26] He had no ill-will against Galba, and\r\nnothing to hope from his fall. Indeed he had sent his son Titus to\r\ncarry his compliments and offer allegiance, an incident we must\r\nreserve for its proper place.[27] It was only after Vespasian's rise\r\nthat Roman society came to believe in the mysterious movings of\r\nProvidence, and supposed that portents and oracles had predestined the\r\nthrone for him and his family.\r\n\r\nOf Egypt and its garrison, ever since the days of the sainted           11\r\nAugustus, the knights of Rome have been uncrowned kings.[28] The\r\nprovince being difficult to reach, rich in crops, torn and tossed by\r\nfanaticism and sedition, ignorant of law, unused to bureaucratic\r\ngovernment, it seemed wiser to keep it in the control of the\r\nHousehold.[29] The governor at that date was Tiberius Alexander,\r\nhimself a native of Egypt.[30] Africa and its legions, now that\r\nClodius Macer had been executed,[31] were ready to put up with any\r\nruler after their experience of a petty master. The two Mauretanias,\r\nRaetia, Noricum, Thrace, and the other provinces governed by\r\nprocurators had their sympathies determined by the neighbourhood of\r\ntroops, and always caught their likes or dislikes from the strongest\r\narmy. The ungarrisoned provinces, and chief amongst these Italy, were\r\ndestined to be the prize of war, and lay at the mercy of any master.\r\nSuch was the state of the Roman world when Servius Galba, consul for\r\nthe second time, and Titus Vinius his colleague, inaugurated the year\r\nwhich was to be their last, and almost the last for the commonwealth\r\nof Rome.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [19] He wrote a history of his own time, which was one of\r\n         Tacitus' chief authorities.\r\n\r\n    [20] See note 17.\r\n\r\n    [21] Verginius' successor.\r\n\r\n    [22] Since Capito's death, chap. 7.\r\n\r\n    [23] He died in A.D. 54.

The fourth legion is III Gallica,\r\n         afterwards moved into Moesia.\r\n\r\n    [26] See note 163.\r\n\r\n    [27] ii. 1.\r\n\r\n    [28] Cp. _Ann._, ii. 59. 'Amongst other secret principles of\r\n         his imperial policy, Augustus had put Egypt in a position by\r\n         itself, forbidding all senators and knights of the highest\r\n         class to enter that country without his permission. For Egypt\r\n         holds the key, as it were, both of sea and land' (tr. Ramsay).\r\n         Cp. iii. 8.\r\n\r\n    [29] i.e. to govern it by the emperor's private agents. The\r\n         province was regarded as part of the emperor's estate\r\n         (patrimonium). This post was the highest in the imperial\r\n         service.\r\n\r\n    [30] A member of a Jewish family settled in Alexandria and\r\n         thus entitled to Roman citizenship. He was a nephew of the\r\n         historian Philo; had been Procurator of Judaea and chief of\r\n         Corbulo's staff in Armenia.\r\n\r\n    [31] See chap. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN REVOLT AND THE ADOPTION OF PISO\r\n\r\nA few days after the first of January a dispatch arrived from           12\r\nBelgica, in which Pompeius Propinquus,[32] the imperial agent,\r\nannounced that the legions of Upper Germany had broken their oath of\r\nallegiance and were clamouring for a new emperor, but that by way of\r\ntempering their treason they referred the final choice to the Senate\r\nand People of Rome. Galba had already been deliberating and seeking\r\nadvice as to the adoption of a successor, and this occurrence hastened\r\nhis plans. During all these months this question formed the current\r\nsubject of gossip throughout the country; Galba was far spent in years\r\nand the general propensity for such a topic knew no check. Few people\r\nshowed sound judgement or any spirit of patriotism. Many were\r\ninfluenced by foolish hopes and spread self-interested rumours\r\npointing to some friend or patron, thereby also gratifying their\r\nhatred for Titus Vinius,[33] whose unpopularity waxed daily with his\r\npower. Galba's affability only served to strengthen the gaping\r\nambition of his newly powerful friends, for his weakness and credulity\r\nhalved the risk and doubled the reward of treason.\r\n\r\nThe real power of the throne was divided between the consul, Titus      13\r\nVinius, and Cornelius Laco, the prefect of the Guards; and an\r\ninfluence as great was enjoyed by Icelus, one of Galba's freedmen, who\r\nhad been given the gold ring[34] and was now greeted by the name of\r\nMarcianus. These three ordinarily disagreed, and followed each his own\r\ninterest in smaller matters: on the question of the succession they\r\nfell into two camps. Vinius was for Marcus Otho. Laco and Icelus were\r\nagreed not so much on any one as on any other. Galba was aware of the\r\nfriendship between Otho and Vinius. Otho was a bachelor and Vinius had\r\nan unmarried daughter: so gossip, never reticent, pointed to them as\r\nfather and son-in-law. Galba, one may suppose, felt some concern for\r\nhis country, too. Why take the throne from Nero, if it was to be left\r\nto Otho? Otho had led a careless boyhood and a dissolute youth, and\r\nendeared himself to Nero by aping his vices. Thus it was to Otho, as\r\nbeing already in the secret, that Nero entrusted his favourite\r\nmistress, Poppaea Sabina,[35] until he could get rid of Octavia. Later\r\nhe grew jealous and removed Otho to the province of Lusitania under\r\ncover of a governorship. Otho had been popular in his administration\r\nof the province, and was one of the first to join Galba's party. Being\r\na man of action and one of the most distinguished of Galba's officers\r\nin the war, when once he had conceived the hope of succeeding him, he\r\neagerly indulged it. Most of the soldiers were on his side and the\r\nCourt supported him as Nero's double.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the news of the German revolt, although Galba knew      14\r\nnothing for certain of Vitellius' plans, he was fearful to what\r\nlengths the outbreak of the troops might go; so, being unable to trust\r\nthe troops in the city,[36] he had recourse to what seemed his sole\r\nremedy and held an Imperial Election. Besides Vinius and Laco he\r\nsummoned Marius Celsus, consul-elect and the City-Prefect Ducenius\r\nGeminus.[37] After prefacing a few words about his own advanced age he\r\nordered Piso Licinianus[38] to be sent for, either on his own\r\ninitiative, or, as some believed, at the instance of Laco. Laco had\r\nmet Piso at Rubellius Plautus' house and they had formed a friendship,\r\nbut he cunningly pretended that he was supporting a stranger, and\r\nPiso's good repute gave colour to this policy. Piso was a noble on\r\nboth sides, being the son of Marcus Crassus and Scribonia. There was\r\nan old-world austerity in his face and bearing, and just critics spoke\r\nof his strict morality: people who took a less favourable view thought\r\nhim soured. But while those who disliked this side of his character\r\ncarped at it, it was a recommendation in the eyes of the emperor who\r\nintended to adopt him.\r\n\r\nGalba is said to have taken Piso's hand and addressed him as            15\r\nfollows: 'Were I a private citizen, and were I to adopt you in the\r\npresence of the Priests by the usual formality of a curial\r\nstatute,[39] it would be an honour for me to introduce into my family\r\na descendant of Cnaeus Pompeius and of Marcus Crassus, and for you it\r\nwould be a distinction to add to your noble ancestry the glories of\r\nthe Sulpician and Lutatian houses.[40] As it is, I have been called by\r\nthe consent of gods and men to be an emperor. Your distinguished\r\nqualities and your patriotism have persuaded me to offer to you\r\npeacefully and quietly the throne for which our ancestors fought on\r\nthe field of battle,[41] and which I too won by war. In so doing I am\r\nfollowing the precedent set by the sainted Augustus, who raised to the\r\nrank next himself first his nephew Marcellus, then his son-in-law\r\nAgrippa, then his daughter's sons,[42] and finally his stepson\r\nTiberius Nero. However, while Augustus looked for a successor in his\r\nown family, I have searched throughout the country. Not that I lack\r\neither kinsmen or supporters, but it was by no favour of birth that I\r\nmyself came to the throne, and, to prove my policy in this matter,\r\nconsider how I have passed over not only my own relatives but yours.\r\nYou have an elder brother,[43] as noble as yourself. He would have\r\nbeen worthy of this position, but you are worthier. You are old enough\r\nto have outlived youthful passions. Your life has been such that you\r\nhave nothing in your past to excuse. So far you have only experienced\r\nmisfortune. Prosperity probes the heart with a keener touch; misery\r\nonly calls for patience, but there is corruption in success. Honesty,\r\ncandour, and affection are the best of human qualities, and doubtless\r\nyou yourself have enough character to retain them. But the\r\ncomplaisance of others will weaken your character. Flattery and\r\nservile compliments will break down its defences and self-interest\r\ntoo, the bane of all sincerity. What though you and I can talk plainly\r\nwith each other to-day? Others will address themselves not to us but\r\nto our fortunes. To persuade an emperor what he ought to do is a\r\nlaborious task: any one can flatter him without a spark of sincerity.\r\n\r\n'If the vast bulk of this empire could stand and keep its balance       16\r\nwithout a guiding hand, the Republic might well have dated its birth\r\nfrom me. As it is, things have long ago come to such a pass that\r\nneither I in my old age can give the Roman people any better gift than\r\na good successor, nor you in your prime anything better than a good\r\nemperor. Under Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, Rome was the heirloom\r\nof a single family. There is a kind of liberty in the free choice we\r\nhave begun to exercise. Now that the Julian and Claudian houses are\r\nextinct, by the plan of adoption the best man will always be\r\ndiscovered. Royal birth is the gift of fortune, and is but valued as\r\nsuch. In adoption we can use a free judgement, and if we wish to\r\nchoose well, the voice of the country points the way. Think of Nero,\r\nswollen with the pride of his long line of royal ancestry. It was not\r\nVindex with a powerless province at his back, nor I with a single\r\nlegion that freed Rome's shoulders of that burden: it was his own\r\ncruelty and profligacy. And that was before there was any precedent\r\nfor the conviction of an emperor.\r\n\r\n'We have been called to the throne by the swords of those who thought\r\nus worthy. Our high state will not escape the eye of envy. You may be\r\nsure of that. But there is no reason for you to feel alarm because in\r\nthis world-wide upheaval a couple of legions have not yet settled\r\ndown. I myself did not succeed to a safe and peaceful throne, and,\r\nwhen once the news of your adoption is spread, I shall cease to be\r\ncharged with my advanced age, which is now the only fault they find in\r\nme. The rascals will always miss Nero: you and I have got to see that\r\ngood citizens do not miss him too.\r\n\r\n'A longer sermon would ill befit the time and I have fulfilled my\r\npurpose, if I have done right in choosing you. The soundest and\r\neasiest criterion of right and wrong policy is to consider what you\r\nwould have approved or condemned in another emperor. For Rome is not\r\nlike the nations which are ruled by kings, where one house is supreme\r\nand the rest are slaves. Your future subjects are men who cannot\r\nendure the extremes either of bondage or of freedom.'\r\n\r\nGalba spoke these words and more to the same effect in the tone of one\r\ncreating an emperor: the rest addressed Piso as though he were emperor\r\nalready. He is said to have betrayed no sign of amazement or            17\r\nelation either before those who were then present, or later when\r\neverybody's eyes centred upon him. His language to his emperor and\r\nadoptive father was deeply respectful and he spoke modestly of\r\nhimself. He made no change in his expression or bearing, showing\r\nhimself more able than anxious to rule. A discussion then took place\r\nwhether the adoption should be announced before the people or in the\r\nsenate, or in the guards' camp. They decided in favour of the camp, on\r\nthe ground that it would be a compliment to the troops, whose goodwill\r\nwas hard to win by flattery or bribes, but was by no means to be\r\ndespised, if it could be won by good means. Meanwhile the curiosity of\r\nthe populace, impatient of any important secret, had brought together\r\ncrowds all round the Palace, and when once the rumour began to leak\r\nout an attempt at suppression only resulted in spreading it.\r\n\r\nThe tenth of January was a dreary wet day, and an extraordinary         18\r\nstorm of thunder and lightning showed the displeasure of Providence.\r\nSuch phenomena were regarded in old days as a sign for the suspension\r\nof public business, but they did not deter Galba from proceeding to\r\nthe camp. Either he disregarded such things as the result of pure\r\nchance or else he felt that the blows of fate may be foretold but not\r\nforestalled. He addressed a crowded assembly of the soldiers with true\r\nimperial brevity, stating simply that in adopting Piso he was\r\nfollowing the example of the sainted Augustus, and the old military\r\ncustom whereby each man chose another.[44] He was afraid that by\r\nsuppressing the news of the German rebellion he might only seem to\r\nexaggerate the danger, so he voluntarily declared that the Fourth and\r\nTwenty-second legions had been led by a few traitors into seditious\r\nmurmurings but no further, and would soon return to their allegiance.\r\nHe made no attempt to enhance his words either by eloquence or\r\nlargess. However, the tribunes and centurions and those of the\r\nsoldiers who stood nearest to him gave well-sounding answers. The rest\r\nwere sorry and silent, for the war seemed to have lost them the\r\nlargess that had always been usual even in peace. Everybody agrees\r\nthat they could have been won over had the parsimonious old emperor\r\nmade the least display of generosity. He was ruined by his strict\r\nold-fashioned inflexibility, which seems too rigorous for these\r\ndegenerate days.\r\n\r\nFrom the camp they proceeded to the senate, and Galba's speech to       19\r\nits members was no fuller or finer than to the soldiers. Piso spoke\r\ngraciously, and there was no lack of support in the senate. Many\r\nwished him well. Those who did not were the more effusive. The\r\nmajority were indifferent, but displayed a ready affability, intent on\r\ntheir private speculations without thought of the country's good. No\r\nother public action is reported of Piso during the four days which\r\nintervened between his adoption and assassination.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [32] i.e. the emperor's finance agent in the province of\r\n         Belgica.\r\n\r\n    [33] Cp. chap. 6.\r\n\r\n    [34] A gold signet-ring was the sign of a free-born Roman\r\n         knight. Its grant to freedmen was an innovation of which\r\n         Tacitus disapproved.\r\n\r\n    [35] Tacitus here follows the story told by Suetonius in his\r\n         life of Otho. In the _Annals_, xiii. 45, 46, Tacitus gives in\r\n         detail a more probable version. It is more likely that Poppaea\r\n         used Otho as a stepping-stone to Nero's favour than that Otho,\r\n         as Suetonius quotes, 'committed adultery with his own wife.'\r\n\r\n    [36] See chap. 5, note 10.\r\n\r\n    [37] One of the three Commissioners of Public Revenue\r\n         appointed by Nero in A.D. 62 (_Ann._, xv. 18).\r\n\r\n    [38] Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi Licinianus was the son of M.\r\n         Licinius Crassus Frugi, and adopted son of L. Calpurnius Piso\r\n         Frugi. His mother, Scribonia, was a descendant of Pompey.\r\n\r\n    [39] Adoption from one family into another needed in old days\r\n         the sanction of the Comitia Curiata. When that assembly became\r\n         obsolete, the priests summoned a formal meeting of thirty\r\n         lictors, and their sanction of an act of adoption was still\r\n         called _lex curiata_. Galba was now _Pontifex maximus_.\r\n\r\n    [40] Galba belonged to the _Gens Sulpicia_, and was connected\r\n         through his mother, Mummia, with Q. Lutatius Catulus, who had\r\n         led the senatorial party in the first half of the last\r\n         century.\r\n\r\n    [41] i.e. Galba's great-grandfather had fought for Caesar\r\n         against Piso's ancestor, Pompey.\r\n\r\n    [42] The children of Julia and Agrippa.\r\n\r\n    [43] Crassus Scribonianus, cp. chap. 47, and iv. 39.\r\n\r\n    [44] i.e. co-optation, employed in former days to raise a\r\n         special contingent for emergencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALBA'S MEASURES OF PRECAUTION\r\n\r\nReports of the German rebellion grew daily more insistent and the\r\npublic was always ready to believe any news, provided it was bad.\r\nAccordingly the senate decided that a commission must be sent to the\r\narmy in Germany. It was discussed in private whether Piso should go\r\nhimself to add dignity to the commission, since he could carry the\r\nauthority of the emperor, while the others represented the senate. It\r\nwas also proposed to send Laco, the prefect of the Guards, but he\r\nobjected. The senate had allowed Galba to nominate the commissioners\r\nand he showed the most miserable indecision, now nominating members,\r\nnow excusing them, now making exchanges, yielding always to pressure\r\nfrom people who wanted to go or to stay at home according as they were\r\ndetermined by their hopes or their fears. The next question was         20\r\none of finance. After investigating all possible sources it seemed\r\nmost reasonable to recover the revenue from those quarters where the\r\ncause of the deficit lay. Nero had squandered in lavish presents two\r\nthousand two hundred million sesterces.[45] Galba gave instructions\r\nthat these monies should be recovered from the individual recipients,\r\nleaving each a tithe of their original gift. However, in each case\r\nthere was scarcely a tenth part left, for these worthless spendthrifts\r\nhad run through Nero's money as freely as they had squandered their\r\nown: they had no real property or capital left, nothing but the\r\napparatus of their luxury. Thirty of the knights were entrusted with\r\nthe duty of recovering the money. This commission, for which there was\r\nno precedent, proved vastly unpopular owing to the scope of its\r\nauthority, and the large number of the victims. Every quarter seemed\r\nbeset with sales and brokers and lawsuits. And yet lively satisfaction\r\nwas caused by the discovery that the beneficiaries of Nero's bounty\r\nwere as poor as the victims of his greed.\r\n\r\nAt this time several officers were cashiered, Antonius Taurus and\r\nAntonius Naso of the Guards, Aemilius Pacensis of the City Garrison,\r\nand Julius Fronto of the Police.[46] However, this proved no remedy.\r\nThe others only began to feel alarmed, thinking that Galba's craft and\r\ntimidity had sacrificed a few, while his suspicions rested on them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [45] About twenty-three million sterling of our money.\r\n\r\n    [46] i.e. of the cohorts which formed the police and\r\n         fire-brigade of the city. See chap. 5, note 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF OTHO\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Otho had nothing to hope from a peaceful settlement: all      21\r\nhis plans demanded a disturbance. Many motives spurred him on: his\r\nextravagance would have ruined a prince, and his poverty have\r\nperplexed a private person: he was angry with Galba and jealous of\r\nPiso. He also alleged fears for his safety, by way of whetting his\r\nambition. 'I proved a nuisance to Nero,' he would say, 'and can\r\nscarcely expect the compliment of a second exile to Lusitania.[47]\r\nBesides, monarchs always hate and suspect the man who is mentioned as\r\n\"next to the throne\". This was what did me harm with the old emperor,\r\nand it will weigh still more with the youthful Piso, who is naturally\r\nsavage and has been exasperated by a long period of exile. It would be\r\neasy to kill me. I must do and dare while Galba's authority is on the\r\nwane and Piso's not yet established. These times of change suit big\r\nenterprises; inaction is more deadly than daring; there is no call for\r\ndelay. Death is the natural end for all alike, and the only difference\r\nis between fame and oblivion afterwards. Seeing that the same end\r\nawaits the innocent and the guilty, a man of spirit should at least\r\ndeserve his fate.'\r\n\r\nOtho's character was by no means so effeminate as his person. His       22\r\nintimate freedmen and slaves, who were allowed a licence unusual in\r\nprivate households, dangled before him the baits for which he was\r\ngreedy: the luxuries of Nero's Court, the marriages he could make, the\r\nadulteries he could commit, and all the other imperial pleasures. They\r\nwere his, they pointed out, if he would bestir himself; it was\r\nshameful to lie quiet and leave them to others. He was also incited by\r\nthe astrologers, who declared that their study of the stars pointed to\r\ngreat changes and a year of glory for Otho. Creatures of this class\r\nalways deceive the ambitious, though those in power distrust them.\r\nProbably we shall go on for ever proscribing them and keeping them by\r\nus.[48] Poppaea[49] had always had her boudoir full of these\r\nastrologers, the worst kind of outfit for a royal ménage. One of them,\r\ncalled Ptolemy, had gone with Otho to Spain[50] and foretold that he\r\nwould outlive Nero. This came true and Otho believed in him. He now\r\nbased his vague conjectures on the computations of Galba's age and\r\nOtho's youth, and persuaded him that he would ascend the throne. But,\r\nthough the man had no real skill, Otho accepted the prophecy as if it\r\nwas the finger of fate. Human nature always likes to believe what it\r\ncannot understand.\r\n\r\nNor was Ptolemy himself slow to incite his master to crime, to          23\r\nwhich it is only a short step from such ambitions. But whether his\r\ncriminal designs were deliberate or suddenly conceived, it is\r\nimpossible to say. He had long been courting the goodwill of the\r\nsoldiers either in the hope of being adopted by Galba or to prepare\r\nthe way for treason. On the road from Spain, while the men were\r\nmarching or on outpost duty, he would address the veterans by name,\r\nreminding them how he and they had served together under Nero, and\r\ncalling them his comrades. He renewed acquaintance with some, asked\r\nafter others and helped them with money or influence, frequently\r\nletting fall complaints and ambiguous remarks about Galba, using all\r\nthe arts which work upon uneducated minds. The soldiers grumbled\r\nbitterly at the exertions of the march, the shortage of provisions,\r\nand the strict discipline. What they were used to was a journey to the\r\nCampanian Lakes or Greek seaports on board ship;[51] they found it\r\nhard to struggle over the Pyrenees and Alps, and march immense\r\ndistances under arms.\r\n\r\nWhile the soldiers were thus already fired with discontent,             24\r\nMaevius Pudens, one of Tigellinus'[52] intimates, added fuel to their\r\nfeelings by luring on all who were naturally unstable or in need of\r\nmoney, or rashly eager for a change. Eventually, whenever Galba dined\r\nwith him, Otho went the length of presenting a hundred sesterces to\r\neach of the soldiers on guard, on the pretext that this was instead of\r\nentertaining them.[53] This system of public largess Otho extended by\r\nmaking presents in confidence to individuals, and such spirit did he\r\nshow in bribery that when a member of the Body Guard, Cocceius\r\nProculus, brought an action to claim part of his neighbour's farm,\r\nOtho bought the whole property out of his own pocket and gave it to\r\nhim. He was enabled to do this by the inefficiency of the Prefect\r\nLaco, who was no less blind to notorious than to secret scandals.\r\n\r\nOtho then put Onomastus, one of his freedmen, in charge of the          25\r\nprojected crime, and Onomastus took into his confidence Barbius\r\nProculus, an aide-de-camp, and a subaltern named Veturius, both in the\r\nBody Guard.[54] Having assured himself by many interviews that they\r\nwere both bold and cunning, Otho proceeded to load them with bribes\r\nand promises, providing them with funds to enable them to test the\r\nfeelings of the others. And so a couple of common soldiers took it\r\nupon them to transfer the Roman Empire: and they did it. A very few\r\nwere admitted as accomplices. These, by various devices, worked on the\r\nindecision of the others. The non-commissioned officers who had been\r\npromoted by Nymphidius felt themselves under suspicion; the private\r\nsoldiers were indignant and in despair at the constant postponement of\r\nGalba's largess; some few were fired by the recollection of Nero's\r\nrégime and longed for the days of licence; all in common shared the\r\nfear of being drafted out of the Praetorian Guards.\r\n\r\nThe infection of treason soon spread to the legions and                 26\r\nauxiliaries, whose excitement had been aroused as soon as they heard\r\nthat the armies of Germany were wavering in their allegiance. So, as\r\nthe disloyal were ready for treason and the loyal shut their eyes,\r\nthey at first determined to acclaim Otho as he was returning from\r\ndinner on the night of the fourteenth. However, they hesitated: the\r\ndarkness spelt uncertainty, the troops were scattered all over the\r\ntown, and unanimity could scarcely be expected from drunken men. They\r\nwere not deterred by any affection for their country's honour, which\r\nthey were deliberately preparing to stain with its emperor's blood,\r\nbut they were afraid that, as Otho was unknown to the majority, some\r\none else might by mistake be offered to the Pannonian or German\r\nlegions and proclaimed emperor. Some evidence of the brewing plot\r\nleaked out, but it was suppressed by the conspirators. Rumours even\r\nreached Galba's ears, but Laco made light of them, being totally\r\nignorant of soldiers' characters, hostile to any suggestion, however\r\nwise, that was not his own, and extremely obstinate with men who knew\r\nmore than he did.\r\n\r\nOn January 15, as Galba was sacrificing in front of the temple of       27\r\nApollo, the priest Umbricius declared the omens unfavourable: treason\r\nwas impending, and an enemy within the walls. Otho, who was standing\r\nbeside Galba, overheard and construed the omen as being from his own\r\npoint of view a good one, favourable to his plans. In a few moments\r\nhis freedman, Onomastus, announced that the architect and contractors\r\nwere waiting to see him. This had been agreed upon as the signal that\r\nthe troops were assembling and the conspiracy was ripe. On being asked\r\nwhere he was going, Otho pretended that he was buying an old property,\r\nbut suspected its condition and so had to inspect it first. Thus,\r\nleaning on his freedman's shoulder, he passed through Tiberius' house\r\ninto the Velabrum and thence to the Golden Milestone at the foot of\r\nthe Temple of Saturn.[55] There thirty-three soldiers of the Body\r\nGuard saluted him as emperor. When he showed alarm at the smallness of\r\ntheir number they put him hastily into a litter, and, drawing their\r\nswords, hurried him away. About the same number of soldiers joined\r\nthem on the way, some accomplices, others merely curious. Some marched\r\nalong shouting and flourishing swords; others kept silent, intending\r\nto take their cue from subsequent events.\r\n\r\nJulius Martialis was the tribune on duty in the camp. He was so         28\r\novercome by the magnitude of this unexpected crime and so afraid that\r\nthe treason was widespread in the camp, and that he might be killed if\r\nhe offered any opposition, that he led most people to suppose he was\r\nin the plot. So, too, the other tribunes and centurions all preferred\r\npresent safety to a risky loyalty. In fact the general attitude was\r\nthis: few dared to undertake so foul a crime, many wished to see it\r\ndone, and everybody was ready to condone it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [47] Cp. chap. 13.\r\n\r\n    [48] Decrees excluding astrologers from Italy had been passed\r\n         in B.C. 33, A.D. 16, and again in A.D. 52. Vitellius passed\r\n         another. See ii. 62.\r\n\r\n    [49] Nero's wife. Cp. chap. 13.\r\n\r\n    [50] i.e. to Lusitania. See chap. 13.\r\n\r\n    [51] They were 'Guards' who had escorted Nero on his singing\r\n         tours through Greece. Perhaps some of them came to meet Galba\r\n         on his way from Spain. Otherwise they could not have shared\r\n         the toils of this march.\r\n\r\n    [52] See chap. 72.\r\n\r\n    [53] The public dinner given in older days by patrons to their\r\n         clients had long ago been commuted for a 'tip' (sportula).\r\n         Pudens, instead of providing dinner for Galba's guard, sought\r\n         their favour by giving them about 17_s._ apiece.\r\n\r\n    [54] The English terms do not of course represent the exact\r\n         position of these soldiers. The former was one of the\r\n         emperor's personal body-guard (speculatores), who received the\r\n         watchword (tessera) and passed it round: the latter was one to\r\n         whom a centurion had delegated some part of his work.\r\n\r\n    [55] Plutarch explains this. 'He passed through Tiberius'\r\n         house, as it is called, and walked down to the Forum, where\r\n         stands the golden pillar to which all the high-roads of Italy\r\n         lead.' The Velabrum lies between the Forum, the Tiber, and the\r\n         Aventine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF GALBA\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Galba in total ignorance and intent upon his sacrifices       29\r\ncontinued to importune the gods of an empire that had already ceased\r\nto be his. First there came a rumour that some one or other of the\r\nsenators was being hurried to the camp, then that it was Otho.\r\nImmediately people who had met Otho came flocking in from all quarters\r\nof Rome; some in their terror exaggerated the truth, some minimized\r\nit, remembering even then to flatter. After discussion it was decided\r\nthat the temper of the cohort on guard in the palace should be tested,\r\nbut not by Galba himself. His authority was held in reserve for more\r\nheroic remedies. The troops were summoned. Piso, standing out on the\r\nsteps of the palace, addressed them as follows:\r\n\r\n'Fellow soldiers, it is now five days since I was made a Caesar. I\r\nknew nothing of the future nor whether the name was more to be desired\r\nor feared. It now lies with you to decide whether or no my adoption is\r\nto prove a calamity for my house and for my country. In saying this, I\r\ndo not dread disaster on my own account. I have known misfortune, and\r\nI am now discovering to the full that prosperity is just as dangerous.\r\nBut for the sake of my adoptive father, of the senate, and of the\r\nwhole empire, I deplore the thought that we may have to-day either to\r\ndie or--what for good men is as wretched--to kill. In the recent\r\nrevolution our comfort was that Rome was spared the sight of blood,\r\nand the transfer was effected without disturbance. We thought that my\r\nadoption would be a safeguard against an outbreak of civil war even\r\nafter Galba's death.\r\n\r\n'I will make no claims to rank or respectability. To compare            30\r\nmyself with Otho, I need not recite my virtues. His vices are all he\r\nhas to be proud of. They ruined the empire, even when he was only\r\nplaying the part of an emperor's friend. Why should he deserve to be\r\nemperor? For his swaggering demeanour? For his effeminate costume?\r\nExtravagance imposes on some people. They take it for liberality. They\r\nare wrong. He will know how to squander money, but not how to give it\r\naway. His mind is full of lechery and debauchery and intrigues with\r\nwomen. These are in his eyes the prerogatives of the throne. And the\r\npleasure of his vices would be all his, the blushes of shame would be\r\nours. No man has ever ruled well who won the throne by bad means.\r\n\r\n'The whole Roman world agreed to give Galba the title of Caesar. Galba\r\nwith your approval gave that title to me. Even if the \"country\", the\r\n\"senate\", the \"people\", are empty terms, it is to your interest, my\r\nfellow soldiers, to see that it is not the rascals who create an\r\nemperor. From time to time one hears of the legionaries being in\r\nmutiny against their generals. But your good faith and your good name\r\nhave stood to this day unimpaired. It was not you who deserted Nero:\r\nhe deserted you. Are you going to allow less than thirty deserters and\r\nrenegades to bestow the crown? Why! no one would tolerate their\r\nchoosing so much as a centurion or a tribune for themselves. Are you\r\ngoing to allow this precedent, and by your acquiescence make their\r\ncrime your own? You will soon see this lawless spirit spreading to the\r\ntroops abroad, and in time the treason will recoil on us and the war\r\non you. Besides, innocence wins you as much as the murder of your\r\nemperor: you will get from us as large a bounty for your loyalty as\r\nyou would from others for your crime.'\r\n\r\nThe members of the Body Guard dispersed. The rest of the cohort         31\r\npaid some heed to his speech. Aimlessly, as happens in moments of\r\nconfusion, they seized their standards, without as yet any fixed plan,\r\nand not, as was afterwards believed, to cloak their treachery. Marius\r\nCelsus had been dispatched to the picked detachments of the Illyrian\r\narmy, which were quartered in the Vipsanian arcade,[56] while\r\ninstructions had been given to two senior centurions,[57] Amullius\r\nSerenus and Domitius Sabinus, to summon the German troops from the\r\nHall of Liberty. They distrusted the legion of marines, who had been\r\nalienated by Galba's butchery of their comrades on his entry into\r\nRome.[58] Three officers of the guards, Cetrius Severus, Subrius\r\nDexter, and Pompeius Longinus, also hurried to the camp in the hope\r\nthat the mutiny was still in its early stages and might be averted by\r\ngood advice before it came to a head. The soldiers attacked Subrius\r\nand Cetrius with threats and forcibly seizing Longinus disarmed him,\r\nbecause he had not come in virtue of his military rank, but simply as\r\none of Galba's private friends; and for his loyalty to his master the\r\nrebels disliked him all the more. The marines without any hesitation\r\njoined the guards. The Illyrian draft[59] drove Celsus away at the\r\npoint of their javelins. The German detachments[59] wavered for some\r\ntime. They were still in poor condition physically, and inclined to be\r\npassive. Nero had dispatched them as an advance-guard to\r\nAlexandria;[60] the long voyage back again had damaged their health,\r\nand Galba had spared no expense in looking after them.\r\n\r\nThe whole populace of Rome was now crowding into the palace             32\r\ntogether with a good sprinkling of slaves. With discordant shouts they\r\ndemanded the death of Otho and the doom of the conspirators. They\r\nmight have been in the circus or the theatre, clamouring for\r\nentertainment. There was neither sense nor sincerity in their\r\nbehaviour. They were quite ready on the same day to clamour for the\r\nopposite with equal zeal. But it is an established custom to flatter\r\nany emperor with unbridled cheering and meaningless enthusiasm.\r\nMeanwhile Galba was torn between two opinions. Titus Vinius maintained\r\nthat they ought to remain within the palace, employ the slaves to\r\noffer resistance and block up all the doors, instead of going out to\r\nface the angry troops. 'This will give time,' he urged, 'for the\r\ndisloyal to repent and the loyal to unite their forces. Crimes demand\r\nhaste, good counsels profit by delay. Besides, if need be, we shall\r\nhave the same chance of leaving the palace later: if we leave and\r\nrepent of it, it will not be in our power to return.'\r\n\r\nAll the others voted for immediate action before the conspiracy         33\r\ngathered strength and numbers. 'Otho,' they argued, 'will soon lose\r\nheart. He crept away by stealth and was introduced in a litter to a\r\nparcel of strangers, and now because we dally and waste time he has\r\nleisure to rehearse his part of emperor. What is the good of waiting\r\nuntil Otho sets his camp in order and approaches the Capitol, while\r\nGalba peeps out of a window? Are this famous general and his gallant\r\nfriends to shut the doors and not to stir a foot over the threshold,\r\nas if they were anxious to endure a siege? Much help may we hope from\r\nslaves, when once the unwieldy crowd loses its unity and their first\r\nindignation, which counts for so much, begins to cool. No, cowardice\r\nis too risky. Or if we must fall, let us meet the danger half-way, and\r\ncover Otho with disgrace, ourselves with honour.'\r\n\r\nWhen Vinius resisted this proposal, Laco, prompted by Icelus,\r\nassailed him with threats, persisting in his private quarrel to the\r\nruin of his country. Galba without further delay supported those        34\r\nwhose plan would look best. However, Piso was first dispatched to the\r\ncamp. The young man had a great name, his popularity was still fresh,\r\nand moreover, he disliked Titus Vinius, or, if he did not, Vinius'\r\nenemies hoped he did: it is so easy to believe in hatred. Scarcely had\r\nPiso departed, when there arrived a rumour that Otho had been killed\r\nin the camp. At first it was vague and uncertain, but eventually, as\r\nso often happens with daring lies, people began to assert that they\r\nhad been present and seen the deed. Some were glad and some\r\nindifferent, so the news gained easy credence. Many, however, thought\r\nthat the report had been concocted and disseminated by friends of\r\nOtho, who now mingled in the crowd and tried to lure Galba out by\r\nspreading this agreeable falsehood. At this point not only the          35\r\npopulace and the inexperienced mob but many of the knights and\r\nsenators as well broke out into applause and unbridled enthusiasm.\r\nWith their fear they had lost their caution. Breaking open the palace\r\ngates they rushed in and presented themselves before Galba,\r\ncomplaining that they had been forestalled in the task of revenge. All\r\nthe cowards who, as events proved, could show no pluck in action,\r\nindulged in excessive heroics and lip-courage. Nobody knew, everybody\r\ntalked. At last, for lack of the truth, Galba yielded to the consensus\r\nof error. When he had put on his breastplate he was lifted into a\r\nchair, for he was too old and infirm to stand against the crowds that\r\nkept flocking in. In the palace he was met by Julius Atticus, of the\r\nBody Guard, who displayed a dripping sword and shouted out that he had\r\nkilled Otho. 'Comrade,' said Galba, 'who bade you?' Galba had a\r\nremarkable power of curbing soldiers' presumption, for he was not\r\nafraid of threats nor moved by flattery.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in Otho's camp there was no longer any doubt of the           36\r\nsoldiers' unanimity. Such was their enthusiasm that they were not\r\ncontent with carrying Otho shoulder-high in procession; they placed\r\nhim among the standards on the platform, where shortly before a gilt\r\nstatue of Galba had stood, and made a ring round him with their\r\ncolours.[61] Tribunes and centurions were allowed no approach: the\r\ncommon soldiers even called out, 'Beware of the officers.' The whole\r\ncamp resounded with confused shouts of mutual encouragement. It was\r\nquite unlike the wavering and spiritless flattery of a civil mob. As\r\nnew adherents streamed in, directly a soldier caught sight of one of\r\nthem, he grasped him by the hand, flung his arms round him, kept him\r\nat his side, and dictated the oath of allegiance. Some commended their\r\ngeneral to his soldiers, and some the soldiers to their general. Otho,\r\nfor his part, was not slow to greet the crowd with outstretched hand\r\nand throw kisses to them. In every way he played the slave to gain a\r\nthrone. When the whole legion of the marines had sworn allegiance, he\r\ngained confidence in his strength, and, considering that those whom he\r\nhad incited individually needed a few words of general encouragement,\r\nhe stood out on the rampart and began as follows:--'In what guise       37\r\nI come forward to address you, Fellow Soldiers, I cannot tell. Dubbed\r\nemperor by you, I dare not call myself a private citizen: yet\r\n\"emperor\" I cannot say with another on the throne. And what am I to\r\ncall you? That too will remain in doubt until it is decided whether\r\nyou have here in your camp an enemy or an emperor of Rome. You hear\r\nhow they clamour at once for my death and your punishment. So clear is\r\nit that we must fall or stand together. Doubtless Galba--such is his\r\nclemency--has already promised our destruction. Is he not the man who\r\nwithout the least excuse butchered thousands of utterly innocent\r\nsoldiers?[62] I shudder whenever I recall his ghastly entry into the\r\ncity, when before the face of Rome he ordered the decimation of the\r\ntroops whom at their humble petition he had taken under his\r\nprotection. That is Galba's only \"victory\". These were the auspices\r\nunder which he made his entry; and what glory has he brought to the\r\nthrone he occupies, save the murder of Obultronius Sabinus and\r\nCornelius Marcellus in Spain, of Betuus Cilo in Gaul, of Fonteius\r\nCapito in Germany, of Clodius Macer in Africa, of Cingonius on his\r\nmarch to Rome, of Turpilianus in the city, and of Nymphidius in the\r\ncamp? What province is there in the empire that has not been polluted\r\nwith massacre? He calls it \"salutary correction\". For his \"remedies\"\r\nare what other people call crimes: his cruelty is disguised as\r\n\"austerity\", his avarice as \"economy\", while by \"discipline\" he means\r\npunishing and insulting you. It is but seven months since Nero's\r\ndeath, and already Icelus alone has embezzled more than all the\r\ndepredations of Polyclitus and Vatinius and Aegialus[63] put together.\r\nWhy, Vinius would have been less greedy and lawless had he been\r\nemperor himself. As it is, he treats us as his own subjects and\r\ndespises us as Galba's. His own fortune alone could provide the\r\nlargess which they daily cast in your teeth but never pay into your\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n'Nor in Galba's successor either is there any hope for you. Galba       38\r\nhas seen to that. He has recalled from exile the man whose avarice and\r\nsour temper he judged most like his own. You witnessed for yourselves,\r\nmy comrades, the extraordinary storm which signified Heaven's\r\nabhorrence at that ill-starred adoption. The Senate and People of Rome\r\nfeel the same. They are counting on your courage. You alone can give\r\nstrength to the right policy: it is powerless without you, however\r\ngood it be. It is not to war and danger that I call you. All the\r\ntroops are with us. That single plain-clothes cohort[64] is no longer\r\na defence to Galba, but a hindrance. When once they have caught sight\r\nof you, when once they come to take their orders from me, the only\r\nquarrel between you will be who can do most to put me in their debt.\r\nThere is no room for delay in plans which cannot be commended until\r\nthey are put into action.'\r\n\r\nOtho then gave orders to open the arsenal. The soldiers immediately\r\nseized their arms in such haste that all the ordinary distinctions of\r\nthe service were neglected: neither Guards nor Legionaries carried\r\ntheir own arms:[65] in the confusion they took the helmets and shields\r\nof the auxiliaries. There were no tribunes or centurions to encourage\r\nthem: each man followed his own lead, and the rascals found their\r\nchief incentive in the consternation of the loyal. As the riot          39\r\nincreased, Piso, alarmed by the din of their shouts, which could be\r\nheard even in the city, had overtaken Galba, who had meanwhile left\r\nthe palace and was approaching the Forum. Marius Celsus had also\r\nbrought back no good news. Some were for returning to the palace,\r\nothers for seeking the shelter of the Capitol, many for seizing the\r\nRostra. The majority merely disagreed with other people's proposals,\r\nand, as so often happens in these disasters, the best course always\r\nseemed the one for which it was now too late. It is said that Laco,\r\nwithout Galba's knowledge, proposed the assassination of Titus Vinius,\r\neither with the idea that his execution would be a sop to the\r\nsoldiers, or because he believed him Otho's accomplice, or, as a last\r\nalternative, hatred may have been his motive. However, the time and\r\nthe place both bred scruples; when killing once begins it is difficult\r\nto set a limit: besides, their plans were upset by the arrival of\r\nterrified messengers, by the continual desertion of their supporters,\r\nand by a general waning of enthusiasm even among those who at first\r\nhad been the keenest to display their loyalty and courage.\r\n\r\nGalba was driven hither and thither by the tide of the surging          40\r\nmob. The temples and public buildings[66] were crowded with\r\nspectators, who viewed a sorry scene. No shouts came from the crowd:\r\nastonishment was on their faces, and their ears open to every sound.\r\nThere was neither uproar nor quiet, but the silence of strong emotion\r\nand alarm. However, a report reached Otho that the populace was\r\narming. He bade his men fly headlong to forestall the danger. Off went\r\nthe Roman soldiers as if they were going to drag Vologaesus or Pacorus\r\nfrom the ancestral throne of the Arsacids[67]--and not to butcher\r\ntheir own emperor, a helpless old man. Armed to the teeth, they broke\r\nat a full gallop into the Forum, scattering the populace and trampling\r\nsenators under foot. Neither the sight of the Capitol nor the sanctity\r\nof the temples towering above them, nor the thought of Roman emperors\r\npast and to come, could avail to deter them from committing that crime\r\nwhich the next successor always avenges.\r\n\r\nSeeing the armed ranks now close at hand, the standard-bearer of        41\r\nthe cohort on guard over Galba[68]--tradition says his name was\r\nAtilius Vergilio--tore off the medallion of Galba[69] and flung it to\r\nthe ground. This signal clearly showed that all the troops were for\r\nOtho: the people fled from the deserted Forum and swords were drawn\r\nagainst any who lingered. Near 'Lake Curtius'[70] Galba was\r\nprecipitated from his chair by the panic-stricken haste of the bearers\r\nand flung to the ground. The accounts of his last words vary according\r\nas they are prompted by hatred or admiration. Some say that he whined\r\nand asked what harm he had deserved, begging for a few days' respite\r\nto pay the troops their largess. The majority say that he offered his\r\nneck to the blow and bade them, 'Come, strike, if it serves the\r\ncountry's need.' Whatever he said mattered little to his assassins. As\r\nto the actual murderer there is a difference of opinion. Some say it\r\nwas Terentius, a reservist,[71] others that his name was Laecanius.\r\nThe most common account is that a soldier of the Fifteenth legion, by\r\nname Camurius, pierced his throat with a sword-thrust. The others\r\nfoully mangled his arms and legs (his breast was covered) and with\r\nbestial savagery continued to stab the headless corpse. Then they made\r\nfor Titus Vinius. Here, too, there is a doubt whether the fear of       42\r\nimminent death strangled his voice, or whether he called out that they\r\nhad no mandate from Otho to kill him. He may have invented this in his\r\nterror, or it may have been a confession of his complicity in the\r\nplot. His whole life and reputation give reason to suppose that he was\r\nan accomplice in the crime of which he was the cause. He was brought\r\nto the ground in front of the temple of Julius by a blow on the knee,\r\nand afterwards a common soldier named Julius Carus ran him through\r\nwith a sword.\r\n\r\nHowever, Rome found one hero that day. This was Sempronius Densus,      43\r\na centurion of the Guards, who had been told off by Galba to protect\r\nPiso. Drawing his dagger he faced the armed assassins, flinging their\r\ntreason in their teeth, and by his shouts and gestures turned their\r\nattention upon himself, thus enabling Piso to escape despite his\r\nwounds. Piso, reaching the temple of Vesta, was mercifully sheltered\r\nby the verger, who hid him in his lodging. There, no reverence for\r\nthis sanctuary but merely his concealment postponed his immediate\r\ndeath. Eventually, Otho, who was burning to have him killed,[72]\r\ndispatched as special agents, Sulpicius Florus of the British cohorts,\r\na man whom Galba had recently enfranchised, and Statius Murcus of the\r\nBody Guard. They dragged Piso forth and butchered him on the threshold\r\nof the temple.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [56] These troops, having no head-quarters in Rome, were put\r\n         up in a piazza built by M. Vipsanius Agrippa, and decorated\r\n         with paintings of Neptune and of the Argonauts.

Vatinius was\r\n         a deformed cobbler from Beneventum who became a sort of court\r\n         buffoon, and acquired great wealth and bad influence.\r\n\r\n    [64] The cohort on guard seem to have been in mufti, without\r\n         helmets and shields or their military cloaks, but armed with\r\n         swords and javelins.\r\n\r\n    [65] The legionaries armed themselves with lances (_hastae_),\r\n         and the auxiliaries with javelins (_pila_).\r\n\r\n    [66] The word _basilica_ refers to the buildings round the\r\n         Forum, used for legal, financial, and commercial purposes.\r\n         Most of them had cloisters.\r\n\r\n    [67] The Parthian royal family: Vologaesus was king of\r\n         Parthia, and his brother Pacorus viceroy of Media Atropatene.\r\n\r\n    [68] Cp. chap. 29.\r\n\r\n    [69] Attached to the pole of the standard.\r\n\r\n    [70] An enclosed pond in the middle of the Forum, supposed to\r\n         be the spot where Curtius leapt on horseback into the chasm,\r\n         or by others the spot where a Sabine chieftain was engulfed in\r\n         the days of Romulus.\r\n\r\n    [71] The word here used usually means a veteran re-enlisted in\r\n         a special corps after his term had expired. It was also\r\n         applied at this time in a special sense to a corps of young\r\n         knights, who, without losing their status, acted as Galba's\r\n         special body-guard in the imperial palace. One of these may\r\n         have been the murderer.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHO ON THE THRONE\r\n\r\nNone of his murders pleased Otho so much as this. On Piso's head,       44\r\nas on no other, they say, he gazed with insatiable eyes. This was\r\npossibly the first moment at which he felt relieved of all anxiety,\r\nand free to indulge his glee; or perhaps, in the case of Galba and of\r\nVinius, the recollection of his treason to the one and of his former\r\nfriendship with the other troubled even his unfeeling heart with\r\ngloomy thoughts, whereas, Piso being an enemy and a rival, he\r\nconsidered it a pious duty to gloat over his murder. Their heads were\r\nfixed on poles and carried along with the standards of the cohorts\r\nside by side with the eagle of the legion.[73] Those who had done the\r\ndeed and those who had witnessed it vied with each other in displaying\r\ntheir bloody hands, all boasting of their share--some falsely, some\r\ntruly--as if it were a fine and memorable exploit. Vitellius\r\nsubsequently discovered more than 120 petitions demanding rewards for\r\ndistinguished services rendered on that day. He gave orders to search\r\nout all the petitioners and put them to death. This was from no\r\nrespect for Galba: he merely followed the traditional custom by which\r\nprinces secure their present safety and posthumous vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe senate and people seemed different men. There was a general         45\r\nrush for the camp, every one shouldering his neighbour and trying to\r\novertake those in front. They heaped insults on Galba, praised the\r\nprudence of the troops, and covered Otho's hand with kisses, their\r\nextravagance varying inversely with their sincerity. Otho rebuffed no\r\none, and succeeded by his words and looks in moderating the menace of\r\nthe soldiers' greed for vengeance. They loudly demanded the execution\r\nof Marius Celsus, the consul-elect, who had remained Galba's faithful\r\nfriend to the last. They were as much offended at his efficiency and\r\nhonesty as if these had been criminal qualities. What they wanted was\r\nobviously to find a first excuse for plunder and murder and the\r\ndestruction of all decent citizens. But Otho had as yet no influence\r\nto prevent crimes: he could only order them. So he simulated anger,\r\ngiving instructions for Celsus' arrest, and by promising that he\r\nshould meet with a worse penalty, thus rescued him from immediate\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe will of the soldiers was now henceforward supreme. The              46\r\nPraetorian Guards chose their own prefects, Plotius Firmus, a man who\r\nhad risen from the ranks to the post of Chief of Police,[74] and\r\njoined Otho's side before Galba's fall, and Licinius Proculus, an\r\nintimate friend of Otho, and therefore suspected of furthering his\r\nplans. They made Flavius Sabinus[75] prefect of the city, therein\r\nfollowing Nero's choice, under whom Sabinus had held that post;\r\nbesides, most of them had an eye to the fact that he was Vespasian's\r\nbrother. An urgent demand arose that the customary fees to centurions\r\nfor granting furlough should be abolished, for they constituted a sort\r\nof annual tax upon the common soldier. The result had been that a\r\nquarter of each company could go off on leave or lounge idly about the\r\nbarracks, so long as they paid the centurion his fee, nor was there\r\nany one to control either the amount of this impost or the means by\r\nwhich the soldiers raised the money: highway robbery or menial service\r\nwas the usual resort whereby they purchased leisure. Then, again, a\r\nsoldier who had money was savagely burdened with work until he should\r\nbuy exemption. Thus he soon became impoverished and enervated by\r\nidleness, and returned to his company no longer a man of means and\r\nenergy but penniless and lazy. So the process went on. One after\r\nanother they became deteriorated by poverty and lax discipline,\r\nrushing blindly into quarrels and mutiny, and, as a last resource,\r\ninto civil war. Otho was afraid of alienating the centurions by his\r\nconcessions to the rank and file, and promised to pay the annual\r\nfurlough-fees out of his private purse. This was indubitably a sound\r\nreform, which good emperors have since established as a regular custom\r\nin the army. The prefect Laco he pretended to banish to an island, but\r\non his arrival he was stabbed by a reservist[76] whom Otho had\r\npreviously dispatched for that purpose. Marcianus Icelus, as being one\r\nof his own freedmen,[77] he sentenced to public execution.\r\n\r\nThus the day was spent in crimes, and worst of all was the joy          47\r\nthey caused. The senate was summoned by the urban praetor.[78] The\r\nother magistrates all vied in flattery. The senators arrived\r\npost-haste. They decreed to Otho the powers of the tribunate, the\r\ntitle of Augustus, and all the imperial prerogatives. Their unanimous\r\nobject was to blot out all recollection of former insults; but, as\r\nthese had been hurled equally from all sides, they did not, as far as\r\nany one could see, stick in his memory. Whether he had forgotten them\r\nor only postponed punishment, his reign was too short to show. He was\r\nthen carried through the still reeking Forum among the piles of dead\r\nbodies to the Capitol, and thence to the palace. He granted permission\r\nto burn and bury the bodies of his victims. Piso's wife Verania and\r\nhis brother Scribonianus laid out his body, and this was done for\r\nVinius by his daughter Crispina. They had to search for the heads and\r\nbuy them back from the murderers, who had preserved them for sale.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [72] According to Plutarch, when they brought Otho Galba's\r\n         head, he said, 'That's nothing: show me Piso's.'\r\n\r\n    [73] i.e. the legion of marines--Prima Adiutrix. Cp. chap. 6, &c.\r\n\r\n    [74] i.e. in command of the _cohortes vigilum_. Cp. chap. 5,\r\n         note 10.\r\n\r\n    [75] Vespasian's elder brother. He continued to hold the\r\n         office under Vitellius (ii. 63).\r\n\r\n    [76] See chap. 42, note 71.\r\n\r\n    [77] As a _libertus Caesaris_ he passed into Otho's hands with\r\n         the rest of the palace furniture.\r\n\r\n    [78] The consuls Galba and Vinius (chap. 1), were both dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\r\n\r\nPiso was in his thirty-first year. His reputation was better than       48\r\nhis fortune. His brothers had been executed, Magnus by Claudius,\r\nCrassus by Nero.[79] He himself after being long in exile was a Caesar\r\nfor four days. Hastily adopted in preference to his elder brother,[80]\r\nthe only advantage he reaped was to be killed first.\r\n\r\nTitus Vinius in his fifty-seven years had displayed strange contrasts\r\nof character. His father belonged to a family of praetorian rank; his\r\nmother's father was one of the proscribed.[81] A scandal marked his\r\nfirst military service under the general Calvisius Sabinus.[82] The\r\ngeneral's wife suffered from a suspicious desire to inspect the\r\narrangements of the camp, which she entered by night disguised in\r\nsoldier's uniform. There she brazenly interfered with the guard and\r\nthe soldiers on duty, and eventually had the effrontery to commit\r\nadultery in the general's own quarters. The man convicted of\r\nimplication in this scandal was Titus Vinius. He was therefore put in\r\nirons by order of Caligula.[83] However, the fortunes of the time soon\r\nchanged and he was set at liberty. After mounting the ladder of office\r\nwithout check, he was as an ex-praetor given the command of a legion,\r\nand proved successful. But soon again he soiled his reputation, and\r\nlaid himself under the charge of having been mean enough to steal a\r\ngold cup from Claudius' dinner-table. Claudius gave orders that on the\r\nnext day Vinius alone of all his guests should be served on\r\nearthenware. However, as pro-consul, Vinius' government of Narbonese\r\nGaul was strict and honest. Subsequently his friendship with Galba\r\nbrought him into danger. He was bold, cunning, and efficient, with\r\ngreat power for good or for evil, according to his mood. Vinius' will\r\nwas annulled because of his great wealth. Piso was poor, so his last\r\nwishes were respected.\r\n\r\nGalba's body lay long neglected, and under cover of darkness was        49\r\nsubjected to various insults. Eventually his steward Argius, one of\r\nhis former slaves, gave it a humble burial in his private garden. His\r\nhead, which the camp-followers and servants had mangled and carried on\r\na pole, was found next day in front of the tomb of Patrobius (one of\r\nNero's freedmen whom Galba had executed) and buried with the body\r\nwhich had already been cremated. Such was the end of Servius Galba,\r\nwho for seventy-three years had enjoyed prosperity under five\r\ndifferent emperors, happier in their reign than his own. He came of an\r\nold and noble family and possessed great wealth. His own character was\r\nmediocre, rather free from vices than rich in virtues. Though not\r\nindifferent to fame, he did not court it by advertisement. Not greedy\r\nof other people's money, he was careful of his own, and a miser with\r\npublic funds. His attitude towards friends and freedmen, if they were\r\nhonest, was one of kindly complaisance; when they were not, he was\r\nculpably blind. But his distinguished origin and the peculiar perils\r\nof the time disguised his apathy, which passed as prudence.[84] In the\r\nflower of his youth he served with distinction in Germany. As\r\npro-consul he governed Africa wisely, and in later years showed the\r\nsame equity in Nearer Spain.[85] When he was a commoner he seemed too\r\nbig for his station, and had he never been emperor, no one would have\r\ndoubted his ability to reign.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [79] Cn. Pompeius Magnus was Claudius' son-in-law, and\r\n         executed by him 'on a vague charge'. M. Licinius Crassus Frugi\r\n         was accused of treason to Nero by Aquilius Regulus, an\r\n         informer, whom one of Pliny's friends calls 'the vilest of\r\n         bipeds'. Regulus' brother was Vipstanus Messala. Cp. iv. 42.\r\n\r\n    [80] Scribonianus. Cp. chap. 15\r\n\r\n    [81] Under the second triumvirate.\r\n\r\n    [82] He was governor of Pannonia under Caligula.\r\n\r\n    [83] Sabinus and his wife were prosecuted, and both committed\r\n         suicide.\r\n\r\n    [84] Under Nero, says Tacitus in his Life of Agricola, 'the\r\n         wisest man was he who did least.'\r\n\r\n    [85] He had governed the upper province of Germany under\r\n         Caligula; Africa under Claudius; the Tarragona division of\r\n         Spain under Nero. In Germany he defeated the Chatti A.D. 41.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF VITELLIUS\r\n\r\nThe city was in a panic. The alarm aroused by the recent atrocious      50\r\ncrime and by Otho's well-known proclivities was further increased by\r\nthe fresh news about Vitellius.[86] This news had been suppressed\r\nbefore Galba's murder, and it was believed that only the army of Upper\r\nGermany had revolted. Now when they saw that the two men in the world\r\nwho were most notorious for immorality, indolence, and extravagance\r\nhad been, as it were, appointed by Providence to ruin the empire, not\r\nonly the senators and knights who had some stake and interest in the\r\ncountry, but the masses as well, openly deplored their fate. Their\r\ntalk was no longer of the horrors of the recent bloody peace: they\r\nreverted to the records of the civil wars, the taking and retaking of\r\nRome by her own troops, the devastation of Italy, the pillage of the\r\nprovinces, the battles of Pharsalia, Philippi, Perusia, and\r\nMutina,[87] those bywords of national disaster. 'The world was turned\r\nupside down,' they mused, 'even when good men fought for the throne:\r\nyet the Roman Empire survived the victories of Julius Caesar and of\r\nAugustus, as the Republic would have survived had Pompey and Brutus\r\nbeen victorious. But now--are we to go and pray for Otho or for\r\nVitellius? To pray for either would be impious. It would be wicked to\r\noffer vows for the success of either in a war of which we can only be\r\nsure that the winner will prove the worse.' Some cherished hopes of\r\nVespasian and the armies of the East: he was preferable to either of\r\nthe others; still they shuddered at the thought of a fresh war and\r\nfresh bloodshed. Besides, Vespasian's reputation was doubtful. He was\r\nthe first emperor who ever changed for the better.\r\n\r\nI must now explain the origin and causes of the rising of               51\r\nVitellius. After the slaughter of Julius Vindex[88] and his whole\r\nforce, the troops were in high spirits at the fame and booty they had\r\nacquired. Without toil or danger they had won a most profitable\r\nvictory. So they were all for marching against the enemy: plunder\r\nseemed better than pay. They had endured a long and unprofitable\r\nservice, rendered the more irksome by the country and climate and by\r\nthe strict discipline observed. But discipline, however stern in time\r\nof peace, is always relaxed in civil wars, when temptation stands on\r\neither hand and treachery goes unpunished. Men, armour, and horses\r\nthey had in abundance for use and for show. But, whereas before the\r\nwar the soldiers only knew the men of their own company or troop, and\r\nthe provincial frontier[89] separated the armies, now, having once\r\njoined forces against Vindex, they had gained a knowledge of their own\r\nstrength and the state of the province, and were looking for more\r\nfighting and fresh quarrels, calling the Gauls no longer allies, as\r\nbefore, but 'our enemies' or 'the vanquished'. They had also the\r\nsupport of the Gallic tribes on the banks of the Rhine, who had\r\nespoused their cause and were now the most eager to rouse them\r\nagainst 'the Galbians'[90] as they now called them, despising the name\r\nof Vindex. So, cherishing hostility against the Sequani and Aedui,[91]\r\nand against all the other communities in proportion to their wealth,\r\nthey drank in dreams of sacking towns and pillaging fields and looting\r\nhouses, inspired partly by the peculiar failings of the strong, greed\r\nand vanity, and partly also by a feeling of irritation at the\r\ninsolence of the Gauls, who boasted, to the chagrin of the army, that\r\nGalba had remitted a quarter of their tribute and given the franchise\r\nand grants of land to their community.[92] Further fuel was added by a\r\nrumour, cunningly circulated and rashly credited, that there was a\r\nproject on foot to decimate the legions and discharge all the most\r\nenterprising centurions. From every side came alarming news and\r\nsinister reports from the city. The colony of Lugdunum[93] was up in\r\narms, and its stubborn attachment to Nero made it a hotbed of rumour.\r\nBut in the camp itself the passions and fears of the soldiers, and,\r\nwhen once they had realized their strength, their feeling of security,\r\nfurnished the richest material for lies and won them easy credence.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding year,[94] shortly after the beginning of               52\r\nDecember, Aulus Vitellius had entered the province of Lower Germany\r\nand held a careful inspection of the winter quarters of the legions.\r\nHe restored many to their rank, remitted degrading penalties, and\r\nrelieved those who had suffered disgrace, acting mainly from ambitious\r\nmotives, but partly also upon sound judgement. Amongst other things he\r\nshowed impartiality in remedying the injustices due to the mean and\r\ndishonest way in which Fonteius Capito had issued promotions and\r\nreductions. The soldiers did not judge Vitellius' actions as those of\r\na mere ex-consul: they took him for something more, and, while serious\r\ncritics found him undignified,[95] his supporters spoke of his\r\naffability and beneficence, because he showed neither moderation nor\r\njudgement in making presents out of his own money and squandering\r\nother people's. Besides, they were so greedy for power that they took\r\neven his vices for virtues. In both armies there were plenty of quiet,\r\nlaw-abiding men as well as many who were unprincipled and disorderly.\r\nBut for sheer reckless cupidity none could match two of the legionary\r\nlegates, Alienus Caecina and Fabius Valens.[96] Valens was hostile to\r\nGalba, because, after unmasking Verginius's hesitation[97] and\r\nthwarting Capito's designs, he considered that he had been treated\r\nwith ingratitude: so he incited Vitellius by pointing out to him the\r\nenthusiasm of the troops. 'You,' he would say to him, 'are famous\r\neverywhere, and you need find no obstacle in Hordeonius Flaccus.[98]\r\nBritain will join and the German auxiliaries will flock to your\r\nstandard. Galba cannot trust the provinces; the poor old man holds the\r\nempire on sufferance; the transfer can be soon effected, if only you\r\nwill clap on full sail and meet your good fortune half-way. Verginius\r\nwas quite right to hesitate. He came of a family of knights, and his\r\nfather was a nobody. He would have failed, had he accepted the empire:\r\nhis refusal saved him. Your father was thrice consul, and he was\r\ncensor with an emperor for his colleague.[99] That gives you imperial\r\ndignity to start with, and makes it unsafe for you to remain a private\r\ncitizen.'\r\n\r\nThese promptings stirred Vitellius' sluggish nature to form desires,\r\nbut hardly hopes.\r\n\r\nCaecina, on the other hand, in Upper Germany, was a handsome            53\r\nyouth, whose big build, imperious spirit, clever tongue, and upright\r\ncarriage had completely won the hearts of the soldiers. While quaestor\r\nin Baetica[100] he had promptly joined Galba's party, and in spite of\r\nhis youth had been given command of a legion. Later he was convicted\r\nof misappropriating public funds, and, on Galba's orders, prosecuted\r\nfor peculation. Highly indignant, Caecina determined to embroil the\r\nworld and bury his own disgrace in the ruins of his country. Nor were\r\nthe seeds of dissension lacking in the army. The entire force had\r\ntaken part in the war against Vindex, nor was it until after Nero's\r\ndeath that they joined Galba's side, and even then they had been\r\nforestalled in swearing allegiance by the detachments of Lower\r\nGermany. Then again the Treviri and Lingones[101] and the other\r\ncommunities which Galba had punished by issuing harsh edicts and\r\nconfiscating part of their territory, were in close communication with\r\nthe winter quarters of the legions. They began to talk treason: the\r\nsoldiers degenerated in civilian society: it only wanted some one to\r\navail himself of the offer they had made to Verginius.\r\n\r\nFollowing an ancient custom, the tribe of the Lingones had made a       54\r\npresent of a pair of silver hands[102] to the legions as a symbol of\r\nhospitality. Assuming an appearance of squalid misery, their envoys\r\nmade the round of the officers' quarters and the soldiers' tents\r\ncomplaining of their own wrongs and of the rewards lavished on\r\nneighbouring tribes. Finding the soldiers ready to listen, they made\r\ninflammatory allusions to the army itself, its dangers and\r\nhumiliation. Mutiny was almost ripe, when Hordeonius Flaccus ordered\r\nthe envoys to withdraw, and, in order to secure the secrecy of their\r\ndeparture, gave instructions to them to leave the camp by night. This\r\ngave rise to an alarming rumour. Many declared that the envoys had\r\nbeen killed, and that, if they did not look out for themselves, the\r\nleading spirits among the soldiers, who had complained of the present\r\nstate of things, would be murdered in the dark, while their comrades\r\nknew nothing about it. So the legions formed a secret compact. The\r\nauxiliaries were also taken into the plot, although at first they had\r\nbeen distrusted, because their infantry and cavalry had been posted in\r\ncamp all round the legion's quarters as though an attack on them were\r\nmeditated. However, they soon showed themselves the keener\r\nconspirators. Disloyalty is a better bond for war than it ever proves\r\nin peace.\r\n\r\nIn Lower Germany, however, the legions on the first of January          55\r\nswore the usual oath of allegiance to Galba, though with much\r\nhesitation. Few voices were heard even in the front ranks; the rest\r\nwere silent, each waiting for his neighbour to take some bold step.\r\nHuman nature is always ready to follow where it hates to lead.\r\nHowever, the feelings of the legions varied. The First and Fifth[103]\r\nwere already mutinous enough to throw a few stones at Galba's statue.\r\nThe Fifteenth and Sixteenth[104] dared not venture beyond muttered\r\nthreats, but they were watching to see the outbreak begin. In Upper\r\nGermany, on the other hand, on the very same day, the Fourth and the\r\nTwenty-second legions, who were quartered together,[105] smashed their\r\nstatues of Galba to atoms. The Fourth took the lead, the\r\nTwenty-second at first holding back, but eventually making common\r\ncause with them. They did not want it to be thought that they were\r\nshaking off their allegiance to the empire, so in taking the oath they\r\ninvoked the long obsolete names of the Senate and People of Rome. None\r\nof the officers made any movement for Galba, and indeed some of them,\r\nas happens in such outbreaks, headed the rebellion. However, nobody\r\nmade any kind of set speech or mounted the platform, for there was no\r\none as yet with whom to curry favour.\r\n\r\nThe ex-consul Hordeonius Flaccus stood by and watched their             56\r\ntreachery. He had not the courage to check the storm or even to rally\r\nthe waverers and encourage the faithful. Sluggish and cowardly, it was\r\nmere indolence that kept him loyal. Four centurions of the\r\nTwenty-second legion, Nonius Receptus, Donatius Valens, Romilius\r\nMarcellus, and Calpurnius Repentinus, who tried to protect Galba's\r\nstatues, were swept away by the rush of the soldiers and put under\r\narrest. No one retained any respect for their former oath of\r\nallegiance, or even remembered it; and, as happens in mutinies, they\r\nwere all on the side of the majority.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the first of January a standard-bearer of the Fourth\r\nlegion came to Cologne,[106] and brought the news to Vitellius at his\r\ndinner that the Fourth and Twenty-second legions had broken down\r\nGalba's statues and sworn allegiance to the Senate and People of Rome.\r\nAs this oath was meaningless, it seemed best to seize the critical\r\nmoment and offer them an emperor. Vitellius dispatched messengers to\r\ninform his own troops and generals that the army of the Upper Province\r\nhad revolted from Galba; so they must either make war on the rebels\r\nimmediately, or, if they preferred peace and unity, make an emperor\r\nfor themselves; and there was less danger, he reminded them, in\r\nchoosing an emperor than in looking for one.\r\n\r\nThe quarters of the First legion were nearest at hand, and Fabius       57\r\nValens was the most enterprising of the generals. On the following day\r\nhe entered Cologne with the cavalry of his legion and auxiliaries, and\r\nsaluted Vitellius as emperor. The other legions of the province\r\nfollowed suit, vying with each other in enthusiasm; and the army of\r\nthe Upper Province, dropping the fine-sounding titles of the Senate\r\nand People of Rome, joined Vitellius on the third of January, which\r\nclearly showed that on the two previous days they were not really at\r\nthe disposal of a republican government. The inhabitants of Cologne\r\nand the Treviri and Lingones, rivalling the zeal of the troops, made\r\noffers of assistance, or of horses or arms or money, each according to\r\nthe measure of their strength, wealth, or enterprise. And these\r\noffers came not only from the civil and military authorities, men who\r\nhad plenty of money to spare and much to hope from victory, but whole\r\ncompanies or individual soldiers handed over their savings, or,\r\ninstead of money, their belts, or the silver ornaments[107] on their\r\nuniforms, some carried away by a wave of enthusiasm, some acting from\r\nmotives of self-interest.\r\n\r\nVitellius accordingly commended the zeal of the troops. He              58\r\ndistributed among Roman knights the court-offices which had been\r\nusually held by freedmen,[108] paid the centurions their furlough-fees\r\nout of the imperial purse,[109] and for the most part conceded the\r\nsoldiers' savage demands for one execution after another, though he\r\noccasionally cheated them by pretending to imprison their victims.\r\nThus Pompeius Propinquus,[110] the imperial agent in Belgica, was\r\npromptly executed, while Julius Burdo, who commanded the fleet on the\r\nRhine, was adroitly rescued. The indignation of the army had broken\r\nout against him, because he was supposed to have intrigued against\r\nFonteius Capito, and to have accused him falsely.[111] Capito's memory\r\nwas dear to the army, and when violence reigns murder may show its\r\nface, but pardon must be stealthy. So Burdo was kept in confinement\r\nand only released after victory had allayed the soldiers' rancour.\r\nMeanwhile a centurion, named Crispinus, was offered as a scape-goat.\r\nHe had actually stained his hands with Capito's blood, so his guilt\r\nseemed more obvious to those who clamoured for his punishment, and\r\nVitellius felt he was a cheaper sacrifice.\r\n\r\nJulius Civilis[112] was the next to be rescued from danger. He was      59\r\nall-powerful among the Batavi,[113] and Vitellius did not want to\r\nalienate so spirited a people by punishing him. Besides, eight cohorts\r\nof Batavian troops were stationed among the Lingones. They had been an\r\nauxiliary force attached to the Fourteenth, and in the general\r\ndisturbance had deserted the legion. Their decision for one side or\r\nthe other would be of the first importance. Nonius, Donatius,\r\nRomilius, and Calpurnius, the centurions mentioned above,[114] were\r\nexecuted by order of Vitellius. They had been convicted of loyalty, a\r\nheinous offence among deserters. His party soon gained the accession\r\nof Valerius Asiaticus, governor of Belgica, who subsequently married\r\nVitellius' daughter, and of Junius Blaesus,[115] governor of the Lyons\r\ndivision of Gaul, who brought with him the Italian legion[116] and a\r\nregiment of cavalry known as 'Taurus' Horse',[117] which had been\r\nquartered at Lugdunum. The forces in Raetia lost no time in joining\r\nhis standard, and even the troops in Britain showed no hesitation.\r\nTrebellius Maximus, the governor of Britain, had earned by his          60\r\nmeanness and cupidity the contempt and hatred of the army,[118] which\r\nwas further inflamed by the action of his old enemy Roscius Coelius,\r\nwho commanded the Twentieth legion, and they now seized the\r\nopportunity of the civil war to break out into a fierce quarrel.\r\nTrebellius blamed Coelius for the mutinous temper and insubordination\r\nof the army: Coelius complained that Trebellius had robbed his men and\r\nimpaired their efficiency. Meanwhile their unseemly quarrel ruined the\r\ndiscipline of the forces, whose insubordination soon came to a head.\r\nThe auxiliary horse and foot joined in the attacks on the governor,\r\nand rallied round Coelius. Trebellius, thus hunted out and abandoned,\r\ntook refuge with Vitellius. The province remained quiet, despite the\r\nremoval of the ex-consul. The government was carried on by the\r\ncommanding officers of the legions, who were equal in authority,\r\nthough Coelius' audacity gave him an advantage over the rest.\r\n\r\nThus reinforced by the army from Britain,[119] Vitellius, who now       61\r\nhad an immense force and vast resources at his disposal, decided on an\r\ninvasion by two routes under two separate generals. Fabius Valens was\r\nto lure the Gauls to his standard, or, if they refused, to devastate\r\ntheir country, and then invade Italy by way of the Cottian Alps.[120]\r\nCaecina was to follow the shorter route and descend into Italy over\r\nthe Pennine Pass.[121] Valens' column comprised the Fifth legion with\r\nits 'eagle',[122] and some picked detachments from the army of Lower\r\nGermany, together with auxiliary horse and foot, amounting in all to\r\n40,000 men. Caecina's troops from Upper Germany numbered 30,000, their\r\nmain strength consisting in the Twenty-first legion.[123] Both columns\r\nwere reinforced by German auxiliaries, whom Vitellius also recruited\r\nto fill up his own army, intending to follow with the main force of\r\nthe attack.\r\n\r\nStrange was the contrast between Vitellius and his army. The            62\r\nsoldiers were all eagerness, clamouring for battle at once, while Gaul\r\nwas still frightened and Spain still undecided. Winter was no obstacle\r\nto them; peace and delay were for cowards: they must invade Italy and\r\nseize Rome: haste was the safest course in civil war, where action is\r\nbetter than deliberation. Vitellius was dully apathetic, anticipating\r\nhis high station by indulging in idle luxury and lavish\r\nentertainments. At midday he would be drunk and drowsy with\r\nover-eating. However, such was the zeal of the soldiers that they even\r\ndid the general's duties, and behaved exactly as if he had been\r\npresent to encourage the alert and threaten the laggards. They\r\npromptly fell in and began to clamour for the signal to start. The\r\ntitle of Germanicus was then and there conferred on Vitellius: Caesar\r\nhe would never be called, even after his victory.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [86] Cp. chap. 14.\r\n\r\n     [87] At Pharsalia Caesar defeated Pompey, 48 B.C.; at Mutina\r\n          the consul Hirtius defeated Antony, 43 B.C.; at Philippi\r\n          Octavian defeated Brutus and Cassius, 42 B.C.; at Perusia\r\n          Octavian defeated Antony's brother Lucius, 40 B.C.\r\n\r\n     [88] See note 15.\r\n\r\n     [89] Between the provinces of Upper and Lower Germany.\r\n\r\n     [90] In the Gallic tongue this signified 'pot-belly'.\r\n\r\n     [91] The Sequani had their capital at Vesontio (Besançon), the\r\n          Aedui at Augustodunum (Autun).\r\n\r\n     [92] Cp. chap. 8.

As the column advanced, an eagle flew\r\nsteadily ahead and seemed to lead the way. Loudly though the soldiers\r\ncheered, hour after hour the bird flew undismayed, and was taken for a\r\nsure omen of success.\r\n\r\nThey passed peaceably through the country of the Treviri, who were      63\r\nallies. At Divodurum,[124] the chief town of the Mediomatrici,\r\nalthough they were welcomed with all courtesy, the troops fell into a\r\nsudden panic. Hastily seizing their arms, they began to massacre the\r\ninnocent citizens. Their object was not plunder. They were seized by a\r\nmad frenzy, which was the harder to allay as its cause was a mystery.\r\nEventually the general's entreaties prevailed, and they refrained from\r\ndestroying the town. However, nearly 4,000 men had already been\r\nkilled. This spread such alarm throughout Gaul, that, as the army\r\napproached, whole towns flocked out with their magistrates at their\r\nhead and prayers for mercy in their mouths. Women and boys prostrated\r\nthemselves along the roads, and they resorted to every possible means\r\nby which an enemy's anger may be appeased,[125] petitioning for peace,\r\nthough war there was none.\r\n\r\nIt was in the country of the Leuci[126] that Valens heard the news      64\r\nof Galba's murder and Otho's elevation. The soldiers showed no\r\nemotion, neither joy nor fear: their thoughts were all for war. The\r\nGauls' doubts were now decided. They hated Otho and Vitellius equally,\r\nbut Vitellius they also feared. They next reached the Lingones,\r\nfaithful adherents of their party. There the courtesy of the citizens\r\nwas only equalled by the good behaviour of the troops. But this did\r\nnot last for long, thanks to the disorderly conduct of the Batavian\r\nauxiliaries, who, as narrated above,[127] had detached themselves from\r\nthe Fourteenth legion and been drafted into Valens' column. A quarrel\r\nbetween some Batavians and legionaries led to blows: the other\r\nsoldiers quickly took sides, and a fierce battle would have ensued,\r\nhad not Valens punished a few of the Batavians to remind them of the\r\ndiscipline they seemed to have forgotten.\r\n\r\nComing to the Aedui,[128] they in vain sought an excuse for fighting.\r\nFor when the natives were ordered to contribute money and arms, they\r\nbrought a gratuitous present of provisions as well. Lugdunum did\r\ngladly what the Aedui had done from fear. But the town was deprived of\r\nthe Italian legion and Taurus' Horse.[129] Valens decided to leave the\r\nEighteenth cohort[130] there in its old winter quarters as a garrison.\r\nManlius Valens, who was in command of the Italian legion, never\r\nreceived any distinction from Vitellius, although he deserved well of\r\nthe party, the reason being that Fabius slandered him behind his back,\r\nwhile to avert his suspicions he praised him to his face.\r\n\r\nThe recent war[131] had served to inflame the long-standing             65\r\nquarrel between Lugdunum and Vienne.[132] Much damage was done on both\r\nsides, and the frequency and animosity of their conflicts proved that\r\nthey were not merely fighting for Nero and Galba. Galba had made his\r\ndispleasure an excuse for confiscating to the Treasury the revenues of\r\nLugdunum, while on Vienne he had conferred various distinctions. The\r\nresult was a bitter rivalry between the towns, and the Rhone between\r\nthem only formed a bond of hatred. Consequently the inhabitants of\r\nLugdunum began to work on the feelings of individual Roman soldiers,\r\nand to urge them to crush Vienne. They reminded them how the Viennese\r\nhad laid siege to Lugdunum, a Roman colony, had assisted the efforts\r\nof Vindex, and had lately raised troops to defend Galba. Having\r\nsupplied a pretext for bad feeling, they went on to point out the rich\r\nopportunity for plunder. Not content with private persuasion, they\r\npresented a formal petition that the army would march to avenge them,\r\nand destroy the head-quarters of the Gallic war. Vienne, they urged,\r\nwas thoroughly un-Roman and hostile, while Lugdunum was a Roman\r\ncolony,[133] contributing men to the army and sharing in its victories\r\nand reverses. They besought them in the event of adverse fortune not\r\nto leave their city to the fury of its enemies.\r\n\r\nBy these arguments and others of the same nature they brought           66\r\nmatters to such a pass, that even the generals and party leaders\r\ndespaired of cooling the army's indignation. However, the Viennese\r\nrealized their danger. Arrayed in veils and fillets,[134] they met the\r\napproaching column and, seizing their hands and knees and the soles of\r\ntheir feet in supplication, succeeded in appeasing the troops. Valens\r\nmade each of the soldiers a present of three hundred sesterces.[135]\r\nThey were thus persuaded to respect the antiquity and high standing of\r\nthe colony, and to listen with patience to their general's speech, in\r\nwhich he commended to them the lives and property of the Viennese.\r\nHowever, the town was disarmed, and private individuals had to assist\r\nthe army with various kinds of provisions. There was, however, a\r\npersistent rumour that Valens himself had been bought with a heavy\r\nbribe. He had long been in mean circumstances and ill concealed his\r\nsudden accession of wealth. Prolonged poverty had whetted his\r\ninordinate desires, and the needy youth grew into an extravagant old\r\nman.\r\n\r\nHe next led the army by slow stages through the country of the\r\nAllobroges and Vocontii,[136] bribes to the general determining the\r\nlength of each day's march and the choice of a camp. For Valens struck\r\ndisgraceful bargains with the landowners and municipal authorities,\r\noften applying violent threats, as, for instance, at Lucus,[137] a\r\ntownship of the Vocontii, which he threatened to burn, until he was\r\nappeased with money. Where it was impossible to get money, he was\r\nmollified by appeals to his lust. And so it went on until the Alps\r\nwere reached.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [124] Metz.\r\n\r\n    [125] They would wear veils and fillets, as suppliants.

The       67\r\nHelvetii, a Gallic tribe[138] once famous as fighting men and still\r\ndistinguished by the memory of their past, having heard nothing of\r\nGalba's murder, refused to acknowledge the authority of Vitellius.\r\nThis exasperated Caecina's headstrong nature. Hostilities broke out\r\nowing to the greed and impatience of the Twenty-first legion, who had\r\nseized a sum of money which was being sent to pay the garrison of a\r\nfort in which the Helvetii used to keep native troops at their own\r\nexpense.[139] The Helvetii, highly indignant at this, intercepted a\r\ndispatch from the German army to the Pannonian legions, and kept a\r\ncenturion and some men in custody. Greedy for battle, Caecina hastened\r\nto take immediate vengeance without giving them time for second\r\nthoughts. Promptly breaking up his camp, he proceeded to harry the\r\ncountry, and sacked a charming and much-frequented watering-place,[140]\r\nwhich had grown during the long peace into the size and importance of\r\na town. Instructions were sent to the Raetian auxiliaries to attack\r\nthe Helvetii in the rear, while their attention was occupied with the\r\nlegion.\r\n\r\nFull of spirit beforehand, the Helvetii were terrified in the face      68\r\nof danger. At the first alarm they had chosen Claudius Severus\r\ngeneral, but they knew nothing of fighting or discipline and were\r\nincapable of combined action. An engagement with the Roman veterans\r\nwould be disastrous; and the walls, dilapidated by time, could not\r\nstand a siege. They found themselves between Caecina and his powerful\r\narmy on the one side, and on the other the Raetian auxiliaries, both\r\nhorse and foot, and the whole fighting force of Raetia as well,\r\ntrained soldiers well used to fighting.[141] Their country was given\r\nover to plunder and massacre. Flinging away their arms, they wandered\r\nmiserably between two fires. Wounded and scattered, most of them took\r\nrefuge on the Bötzberg.[142] But some Thracian auxiliaries were\r\npromptly sent to dislodge them. The German army, aided by the\r\nRaetians, pursued them through the woods, and cut them to pieces in\r\ntheir hiding-places. Many thousands were killed and many sold as\r\nslaves. Having completed the work of destruction, the army advanced in\r\nhostile array against Aventicum,[143] their capital town, and were met\r\nby envoys offering surrender. The offer was accepted. Caecina executed\r\nJulius Alpinus, one of their chief men, as the prime instigator of the\r\nrevolt. The rest he left to experience the clemency or cruelty of\r\nVitellius.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say whether these envoys found Vitellius or the army the\r\nmore implacable. The soldiers clamoured for the destruction of the\r\ntown,[144] and shook their fists and weapons in the envoys' faces:\r\neven Vitellius indulged in threatening language. Ultimately, however,\r\nClaudius Cossus, one of the envoys, a noted speaker who greatly\r\nenhanced the effect of his eloquence by concealing his skill under a\r\nwell-timed affectation of nervousness, succeeded in softening the\r\nhearts of the soldiers. A mob is always liable to sudden changes of\r\nfeeling, and the men were as sensible to pity as they had been\r\nextravagant in their brutality. Thus with streams of tears and\r\nimportunate prayers for a better answer the envoys procured a free\r\npardon for Aventicum.[145]\r\n\r\nCaecina halted for a few days in Helvetian territory until he           70\r\ncould get news of Vitellius' decision. Meantime, while carrying on his\r\npreparations for crossing the Alps, he received from Italy the joyful\r\nnews that 'Silius' Horse',[146] stationed at Padua, had come over to\r\nVitellius. The members of this troop had served under Vitellius when\r\npro-consul in Africa. They had subsequently been detached under orders\r\nfrom Nero to precede him to Egypt, and had then been recalled, owing\r\nto the outbreak of the war with Vindex. They were now in Italy. Their\r\nofficers, who knew nothing of Otho and were attached to Vitellius,\r\nextolled the strength of the approaching column and the fame of the\r\nGerman army. So the troop went over to Vitellius, bringing their new\r\nemperor a gift of the four strongest towns of the Transpadane\r\ndistrict, Milan, Novara, Eporedia,[147] and Vercelli. Of this they\r\ninformed Caecina themselves. But one troop of horse could not garrison\r\nthe whole of the widest part of Italy. Caecina accordingly hurried\r\nforward the Gallic, Lusitanian, and British auxiliaries, and some\r\nGerman detachments, together with 'Petra's Horse',[148] while he\r\nhimself hesitated whether he should not cross the Raetian Alps[149]\r\ninto Noricum and attack the governor, Petronius Urbicus, who, having\r\nraised a force of irregulars and broken down the bridges, was supposed\r\nto be a faithful adherent of Otho. However, he was afraid of losing\r\nthe auxiliaries whom he had sent on ahead, and at the same time he\r\nconsidered that there was more glory in holding Italy, and that,\r\nwherever the theatre of the war might be, Noricum was sure to be among\r\nthe spoils of victory. So he chose the Pennine route[150] and led his\r\nlegionaries and the heavy marching column across the Alps, although\r\nthey were still deep in snow.[151]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [138] In Western Switzerland.

He postponed his pleasures and disguised his extravagance,\r\nsuiting all his behaviour to the dignity of his position. But people\r\nknew they had not seen the last of his vices, and his virtuous\r\nhypocrisy only increased their alarm. He gave orders to summon Marius\r\nCelsus to the Capitol. This was the consul-elect whom he had rescued\r\nfrom the savage clutches of the soldiers by pretending to put him in\r\nprison.[152] Otho now wanted to earn a name for clemency by pardoning\r\na well-known man, who had fought against his party. Celsus was firm.\r\nPleading guilty to the charge of fidelity to Galba, he went on to show\r\nthat he had set an example which was all to Otho's advantage. Otho\r\ntreated him as if there was nothing to pardon. Calling on heaven to\r\nwitness their reconciliation, he then and there admitted him to the\r\ncircle of his intimate friends, and subsequently gave him an\r\nappointment as one of his generals. Celsus remained faithful to Otho\r\ntoo, doomed apparently to the losing side. His acquittal, which\r\ndelighted the upper classes and was popular with the mass of the\r\npeople, even earned the approval of the soldiers, who now admired the\r\nqualities which had previously aroused their indignation.\r\n\r\nEqual rejoicing, though for different reasons, followed the             72\r\nlong-looked-for downfall of Ofonius Tigellinus. Born of obscure\r\nparentage, he had grown from an immoral youth into a vicious old man.\r\nHe rose to the command first of the Police,[153] and then of the\r\nPraetorian Guards, finding that vice was a short cut to such rewards\r\nof virtue. In these and other high offices he developed the vices of\r\nmaturity, first cruelty, then greed. He corrupted Nero and introduced\r\nhim to every kind of depravity; then ventured on some villainies\r\nbehind his back, and finally deserted and betrayed him. Thus in his\r\ncase, as in no other, those who hated Nero and those who wished him\r\nback agreed, though from different motives, in calling loudly for his\r\nexecution. During Galba's reign he had been protected by the influence\r\nof Titus Vinius, on the plea that he had saved his daughter. Saved her\r\nhe had, not from any feelings of pity (he had killed too many for\r\nthat), but to secure a refuge for the future. For all such rascals,\r\ndistrusting the present and fearing a change of fortune, always\r\nprepare for themselves a shelter against public indignation by\r\nobtaining the favour of private persons. So they rely to escape\r\npunishment not on their innocence but on a system of mutual insurance.\r\nPeople were all the more incensed against Tigellinus, since the recent\r\nfeeling against Vinius was added to their old hatred for him. From all\r\nquarters of Rome they flocked to the palace and the squares; and above\r\nall, in the circus and the theatre, where the mob enjoys complete\r\nlicence, they assembled in crowds and broke out into riotous uproar.\r\nEventually Tigellinus at Sinuessa Spa[154] received the news that his\r\nlast hour was inevitably come. There after a cowardly delay in the\r\nfoul embraces of his prostitutes he cut his throat with a razor, and\r\nblackened the infamy of his life by a hesitating and shameful death.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time there arose a demand for the punishment of          73\r\nCalvia Crispinilla. But she was saved by various prevarications, and\r\nOtho's connivence cost him some discredit. This woman had tutored Nero\r\nin vice, and afterwards crossed to Africa to incite Clodius Macer[155]\r\nto civil war. While there she openly schemed to start a famine in\r\nRome. However, she secured herself by marrying an ex-consul, and lived\r\nto enjoy a wide popularity in Rome. She escaped harm under Galba,\r\nOtho, and Vitellius, and eventually wielded a great influence due to\r\nher being both rich and childless, considerations of the first\r\nimportance in any state of society.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Otho wrote constantly to Vitellius, holding out        74\r\nvarious effeminate inducements, making him offers of money or an\r\ninfluential position, or any retreat he liked to select for a life of\r\nluxury.[156] Vitellius made similar offers. At first both wrote in the\r\nmildest tone, though the affectation on either side was stupid and\r\ninappropriate. But they soon struck a quarrelsome note, and reproached\r\neach other with immorality and crime, both with a good deal of truth.\r\nOtho recalled the commission which Galba had sent out to Germany,[157]\r\nand, using the pretext of senatorial authority, sent fresh\r\ncommissioners to both the armies in Germany, and also to the Italian\r\nlegion, and the troops quartered at Lugdunum. However, the\r\ncommissioners remained with Vitellius with a readiness which showed\r\nthey were under no compulsion; and the guards who had been attached to\r\nthem, ostensibly as a mark of honour, were sent back at once before\r\nthey had time to mix with the legionary soldiers. Further than this,\r\nFabius Valens sent letters in the name of the German army to the\r\nGuards and the City Garrison, extolling the strength of his own side\r\nand offering to join forces. He even went so far as to reproach them\r\nwith having transferred to Otho the title which had long before[158]\r\nbeen conferred on Vitellius. Thus they were assailed with threats       75\r\nas well as promises, and told that they were not strong enough to\r\nfight, and had nothing to lose by making peace. But, in spite of all,\r\nthe fidelity of the Guards remained unchanged. However, Otho\r\ndispatched assassins to Germany, Vitellius to Rome. Neither met with\r\nsuccess. Vitellius' assassins were lost in the crowds of Rome, where\r\nnobody knows anybody, and thus escaped detection: Otho's were betrayed\r\nby their strange faces, since the troops all knew each other by sight.\r\nVitellius then composed a letter to Otho's brother Titianus,[159]\r\nthreatening that his life and his son's should answer for the safety\r\nof Vitellius' mother and children. As it happened neither household\r\nsuffered. Fear was perhaps the reason in Otho's time, but Vitellius,\r\nafter his victory, could certainly claim credit for clemency.\r\n\r\nThe first news which gave Otho any degree of confidence was the         76\r\nannouncement from Illyricum that the legions of Dalmatia and Pannonia\r\nand Moesia[160] had sworn allegiance to him. Similar news arrived from\r\nSpain, and Cluvius Rufus[161] was commended in a special decree, but\r\nit was found out immediately afterwards that Spain had gone over to\r\nVitellius. Even Aquitania soon fell away, although Julius Cordus had\r\nsworn in the province for Otho. Loyalty and affection seemed dead: men\r\nchanged from one side to the other under the stress of fear or\r\ncompulsion. It was fear which gave Vitellius the Province of Narbonese\r\nGaul,[162] for it is easy to go over when the big battalions are so\r\nnear. The distant provinces and the troops across the sea all remained\r\nat Otho's disposal, but not from any enthusiasm for his cause; what\r\nweighed with them was the name of Rome and the title of the senate.\r\nBesides, Otho had got the first hearing. Vespasian swore in the Jewish\r\narmy[163] for Otho, and Mucianus the legions in Syria;[164] Egypt too\r\nand all the provinces towards the East were held for him. He also\r\nreceived the submission of Africa, where Carthage had taken the lead,\r\nwithout waiting for the sanction of the governor, Vipstanus\r\nApronianus. Crescens, one of Nero's freedmen--in evil days these\r\ncreatures play a part in politics[165]--had given the common people of\r\nthe town a gala dinner in honour of the new emperor, with the result\r\nthat the inhabitants hurried into various excesses. The other African\r\ncommunities followed the example of Carthage.\r\n\r\nThe provinces and their armies being thus divided, Vitellius could      77\r\nonly win the throne by fighting. Otho meanwhile was carrying on the\r\ngovernment as if the time were one of profound peace. Sometimes he\r\nconsulted the country's dignity, though more often the exigencies of\r\nthe moment forced him into unseemly haste. He held the consulship\r\nhimself with his brother Titianus as colleague until the first of\r\nMarch. For the next two months he appointed Verginius, as a sort of\r\nsop to the army in Germany.[166] As colleague he gave him Pompeius\r\nVopiscus, ostensibly because he was an old friend of his own, but it\r\nwas generally understood as a compliment to Vienne.[167] For the rest\r\nof the year the appointments which Nero or Galba had made were allowed\r\nto stand. The brothers Caelius and Flavius Sabinus[168] were consuls\r\nfor June and July, Arrius Antoninus[169] and Marius Celsus for August\r\nand September; even Vitellius after his victory did not cancel their\r\nappointment. To the pontifical and augural colleges Otho either\r\nnominated old ex-magistrates, as the final crown of their career, or\r\nelse, when young aristocrats returned from exile, he instated them by\r\nway of recompense in the pontifical posts which their fathers or\r\ngrandfathers had held. He restored Cadius Rufus, Pedius Blaesus, and\r\n_Saevinus Proculus_[170] to their seats in the senate. They had been\r\nconvicted during Claudius' and Nero's reigns of extortion in the\r\nprovinces. In pardoning them the name of their offence was changed,\r\nand their greed appeared as 'treason'. For so unpopular was the law of\r\ntreason that it sapped the force of better statutes.[171]\r\n\r\nOtho next tried to win over the municipalities and provincial           78\r\ntowns by similar bribes. At the colonies of Hispalis and Emerita[172]\r\nhe enrolled new families of settlers, granted the franchise to the\r\nwhole community of the Lingones,[173] and made over certain Moorish\r\ntowns as a gift to the province of Baetica. Cappadocia and Africa were\r\nalso granted new privileges, as showy as they were short-lived. All\r\nthese grants are excused by the exigences of the moment and the\r\nimpending crisis, but he even found time to remember his old amours\r\nand passed a measure through the senate restoring Poppaea's\r\nstatues.[174] He is believed also to have thought of celebrating\r\nNero's memory as a means of attracting public sympathy. Some persons\r\nactually erected statues of Nero, and there were times when the\r\npopulace and the soldiers, by way of enhancing his fame and dignity,\r\nsaluted him as Nero Otho. However, he refused to commit himself. He\r\nwas ashamed to accept the title, yet afraid to forbid its use.\r\n\r\nWhile the whole of Rome was intent upon the civil war, foreign          79\r\naffairs were neglected. Consequently a Sarmatian tribe called the\r\nRhoxolani,[175] who had cut up two cohorts of auxiliaries in the\r\nprevious winter, now formed the still more daring scheme of invading\r\nMoesia. Inspirited by success, they assembled nearly 9,000 mounted\r\nmen, all more intent on plunder than on fighting. While they were\r\nriding about aimlessly without any suspicion of danger, they were\r\nsuddenly attacked by the Third legion[176] and its native auxiliaries.\r\nOn the Roman side everything was ready for a battle: the Sarmatians\r\nwere scattered over the country; some in their greed for plunder were\r\nheavily laden, and their horses could scarcely move on the slippery\r\nroads. They were caught in a trap and cut to pieces. It is quite\r\nextraordinary how all a Sarmatian's courage is, so to speak, outside\r\nhimself. Fighting on foot, no one is more cowardly; but their cavalry\r\ncharge would break almost any troops. On this occasion it was raining\r\nand the ground was greasy with thaw; their pikes and their long\r\nswords, needing both hands to wield, were useless; their horses\r\nslipped and they were encumbered by the heavy coat of mail which all\r\ntheir chiefs and nobles wear. Being made of iron plates and a very\r\nhard kind of leather, it is impenetrable to blows, but most\r\ninconvenient for any one who is knocked down by a charge of the enemy\r\nand tries to get up. Besides, they sank into the deep, soft snow. The\r\nRoman soldiers in their neat leather jerkins, armed with javelin and\r\nlance, and using, if need be, their light swords, sprang on the\r\nunarmed Sarmatians (they never carry shields) and stabbed them at\r\nclose quarters. A few, surviving the battle, hid themselves in the\r\nmarshes, and there perished miserably from the severity of the winter\r\nand their wounds. When the news of this reached Rome, Marcus Aponius,\r\nthe governor of Moesia, was granted a triumphal statue,[177] while the\r\ncommanding officers of the legions, Fulvius Aurelius, Tettius\r\nJulianus, and Numisius Lupus, received the insignia of consular rank.\r\nOtho was delighted and took all the credit to himself, as if he had\r\nbeen the successful general, and had himself employed his officers and\r\narmies to enlarge the empire.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a riot broke out in an unexpected quarter, and,         80\r\nthough trivial at first, nearly ended in the destruction of Rome. Otho\r\nhad given orders that the Seventeenth cohort[178] should be summoned\r\nfrom the colony of Ostia to the city, and Varius Crispinus, a tribune\r\nof the guards, was instructed to provide them with arms. Anxious to\r\ncarry out his instructions undisturbed while the camp was quiet, he\r\narranged that the arsenal was to be opened and the cohort's wagons\r\nloaded after nightfall. The hour aroused suspicion; the motive was\r\nquestioned; his choice of a quiet moment resulted in an uproar. The\r\nmere sight of swords made the drunken soldiers long to use them. They\r\nbegan to murmur and accuse their officers of treachery, suggesting\r\nthat the senators' slaves were going to be armed against Otho. Some of\r\nthem were too fuddled to know what they were saying: the rascals saw\r\na chance of plunder: the mass of them, as usual, were simply eager for\r\na change: and such as were loyal could not carry out their orders in\r\nthe darkness. When Crispinus tried to check them, the mutineers killed\r\nhim together with the most determined of the centurions, seized their\r\narmour, bared their swords, and mounting the horses, made off at full\r\nspeed for Rome and the palace.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that a large party of Roman senators and their           81\r\nwives was dining with Otho. In their alarm they wondered whether the\r\nsoldiers' outbreak was unpremeditated or a ruse of the emperor's:\r\nwould it be safer to fly in all directions or to stay and be arrested?\r\nAt one moment they would make a show of firmness, at the next their\r\nterror betrayed them. All the time they were watching Otho's face,\r\nand, as happens when people suspect each other, he was just as afraid\r\nhimself as they were of him. But feeling no less alarm for the\r\nsenators than for himself, he promptly dispatched the prefects of the\r\nGuards to appease the anger of the troops, and told all his guests to\r\nleave immediately. Then on all sides Roman officials could be seen to\r\nthrow away their insignia, avoid their suite, and slink off\r\nunattended. Old gentlemen and their wives roamed the dark streets in\r\nall directions. Few went home, most of them fled to friends, or sought\r\nan obscure refuge with the humblest of their clients.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers' onrush could not be stopped at the gates of the           82\r\npalace. They demanded to see Otho and invaded the banquet-hall.\r\nJulius Martialis, a tribune of the Guards, and Vitellius Saturninus,\r\nthe camp-prefect[179] of the legion, were wounded while endeavouring\r\nto bar their progress. On every side they brandished swords and hurled\r\nthreats, now against their officers, now against the whole senate; and\r\nsince they could not select any one victim for their wrath, in a blind\r\nfrenzy of panic they clamoured for a free hand against all the\r\nsenators. At last Otho, sacrificing his dignity, stood up on a couch\r\nand with great difficulty restrained them by means of prayers and\r\ntears. They returned to their camp unwillingly, and with a guilty\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nThe next day Rome was like a captured city. The houses were all shut,\r\nthe streets almost deserted, and everybody looked depressed. The\r\nsoldiers, too, hung their heads, though they were more sulky than\r\nsorry for what they had done. Their prefects, Licinius Proculus and\r\nPlotius Firmus, harangued them by companies, the one mildly, the other\r\nharshly, for they were men of different natures. They concluded by\r\nannouncing that the men were to receive five thousand sesterces[180]\r\napiece. After that Otho ventured to enter the camp. The tribunes and\r\ncenturions each flinging away the insignia of his rank,[181] crowded\r\nround him begging for a safe discharge. Stung by the disgrace of this,\r\nthe troops soon quieted down, and even went the length of demanding\r\nthat the ringleaders should be punished. In the general disturbance\r\nOtho's position was difficult.  The soldiers were by no means           83\r\nunanimous. The better sort wanted him to put a stop to the prevalent\r\ninsubordination, but the great bulk of them liked faction-fighting and\r\nemperors who had to court their favour, and with the prospect of\r\nrioting and plunder were ready enough for civil war. He realized,\r\nalso, that one who wins a throne by violence cannot keep it by\r\nsuddenly trying to enforce the rigid discipline of earlier days.\r\nHowever, the danger of the crisis both for the city and the senate\r\nseriously alarmed him, so he finally delivered himself as follows:--\r\n\r\n'Fellow soldiers, I have not come to fan the fire of your affection\r\nfor me, or to instil courage into your hearts: in both those qualities\r\nyou are more than rich. No, I have come to ask you to moderate your\r\ncourage and to set some bounds to your affection. These recent\r\ndisturbances did not originate in those passions of greed or violence,\r\nwhich so often cause dissension in an army; nor was it that you\r\nfeared some danger and tried to shirk it. The sole cause was your\r\nexcessive loyalty, which you displayed with more ardour than\r\njudgement. For with the best of motives, indiscretion often lands men\r\nin disaster. We are preparing for war. Do you imagine that we could\r\npublish all our dispatches, and discuss our plans in the presence of\r\nthe whole army, when we have to devise a systematic campaign and keep\r\nup with the rapid changes of the situation? There are things a soldier\r\nought to know, but there is much of which he must be ignorant. It is\r\nnecessary for the maintenance of strict discipline and of the\r\ngeneral's authority that even his tribunes and centurions should often\r\nobey blindly. If every one is going to inquire into his motives,\r\ndiscipline is done for, and his authority falls to the ground. Suppose\r\nin actual warfare you are called to arms at dead of night: shall a few\r\ndrunken blackguards--for I cannot believe that many lost their heads\r\nin the recent panic--go and stain their hands with their officers'\r\nblood, and then break into the general's tent?\r\n\r\n'Now I know you did it to protect me, but the riot and the              84\r\ndarkness and the general confusion might easily have provided an\r\nopportunity to kill me. Suppose Vitellius and his satellites had their\r\nchoice of the state of mind they would pray to find us in; what more\r\ncould they desire than mutiny and dissension, the men insubordinate to\r\nthe centurions, and the centurions to their superior officers, and the\r\nwhole force, horse and foot alike, rushing in headlong confusion to\r\ntheir ruin? Good soldiering, my comrades, consists in obedience, not\r\nin scrutinizing the general's orders; and the army which is most\r\norderly in peace is most courageous on the field of battle. Yours are\r\nthe swords and the courage; you must leave it to me to plan the\r\ncampaign, and to direct your valour. The culprits were but few, and\r\nonly two are to be punished; the rest of you must blot out all memory\r\nof that discreditable night. No army must ever hear again such words\r\nspoken against the senate. It is the brain of the empire and the glory\r\nof all the provinces. Why, in Heaven's name, the very Germans\r\nthemselves, whom Vitellius is stirring up with all his might against\r\nus, would not dare to call its members into question! Shall it be said\r\nthat Italy's own sons, the real soldiery of Rome, are clamouring to\r\nmurder and massacre the very senators whose lustre it is that throws\r\ninto the shade the obscure and vulgar adherents of Vitellius?\r\nVitellius has seized a few provinces and raised a sort of shadow of an\r\narmy; but the senate is on our side. Therefore, Rome is for us; they\r\nare against her. Do you imagine that the stability of this beautiful\r\ncity consists in houses and edifices built of stone upon stone? Nay,\r\nthey are dumb inanimate things that may fall to pieces and be rebuilt\r\nat pleasure. The eternity of our empire, the peace of the world, your\r\nwelfare and mine, all depend upon the safety of the senate. Instituted\r\nwith solemn ceremony by the father and founder of Rome, the senate has\r\ncome down in undying continuity from the kings to the emperors; and as\r\nwe have received it from our ancestors, so let us hand it on to our\r\nposterity. From your ranks come the senators, and from the senate come\r\nthe emperors of Rome.'\r\n\r\nThis speech, as being well calculated to provide a reprimand and a      85\r\nsedative for the soldiers, and Otho's moderation--for he only ordered\r\nthe punishment of two men--were well received. He had calmed for a\r\nmoment the troops he could not control. Yet peace and quiet were not\r\nrestored in Rome. One could still detect the clash of arms and the\r\nlurid face of war. Refraining from organized riot, the soldiers now\r\ndispersed to private houses and lived in disguise, giving vent to\r\ntheir bad feeling by maligning all whom nobility of birth or wealth or\r\nany other distinction made a mark for scandal. Many, besides, believed\r\nthat some of Vitellius' soldiers had come to Rome to study the state\r\nof party feeling. Everywhere suspicion was rife, and terror invaded\r\neven the privacy of the home. But far greater was the alarm displayed\r\nin public places. With every fresh piece of news that rumour brought,\r\nmen's feelings and the expression on their faces changed. They were\r\nafraid to be found lacking in confidence when things looked doubtful,\r\nor in joy when they went well for Otho. Above all, when the senate was\r\nsummoned to the House, they found it extraordinarily hard always to\r\nstrike the right note. Silence would argue arrogance; plain speaking\r\nwould arouse suspicion; yet flattery would be detected by Otho, who\r\nhad so lately been a private citizen, practising the art himself. So\r\nthey had to turn and twist their sentences. Vitellius they called\r\nenemy and traitor, the more prudent confining themselves to such vague\r\ngeneralities. A few ventured to fling the truth at him, but they\r\nalways chose a moment of uproar when a great many people were all\r\nshouting at once, or else they talked so loud and fast as to drown\r\ntheir own words.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of alarm was the various portents vouched for by          86\r\nmany witnesses. In the Capitoline Square, it was said, the figure of\r\nVictory had let the reins of her chariot slip from her hands: a ghost\r\nof superhuman size had suddenly burst out of the chapel of Juno:[182]\r\na statue of the sainted Julius on the island in the Tiber had, on a\r\nfine, still day, turned round from the west and faced the east: an ox\r\nhad spoken in Etruria: animals had given birth to strange monsters.\r\nMany were the stories of these occurrences, which in primitive ages\r\nare observed even in time of peace, though now we only hear of them in\r\ntime of panic. But the greatest damage at the moment, and the greatest\r\nalarm for the future, was caused by a sudden rising of the Tiber.\r\nImmensely swollen, it carried away the bridge on piles,[183] and, its\r\ncurrent being stemmed by the heavy ruins, it flooded not only the\r\nflat, low-lying portions of the city, but also districts that seemed\r\nsafe from inundation. Many people were swept away in the streets,\r\nstill more were overtaken by the flood in shops or in their beds at\r\nhome. The result was a famine, since food was scarce,[184] and the\r\npoor were deprived of their means of livelihood. Blocks of flats, the\r\nfoundations of which had rotted in the standing water, collapsed when\r\nthe river sank. No sooner had the panic caused by the flood subsided\r\nthan it was found that, whereas Otho was preparing an expedition, its\r\nroute over the Martian Plain and up the Flaminian Road was blocked.\r\nThough probably caused by chance, or the course of Nature, this mishap\r\nwas turned into a miraculous omen of impending disaster.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [152] Chap. 45.\r\n\r\n    [153] Cp. note 46.\r\n\r\n    [154] A much-frequented watering-place on the borders of\r\n          Latium and Campania.

See note 130.\r\n\r\n    [179] The meaning of the title _praefectus legionis_ is\r\n          doubtful. It seems most likely to mean the same as _praefectus\r\n          castrorum_, an officer who superintended the camp and\r\n          sometimes acted as second-in-command (cp. ii. 89). The post\r\n          was one to which senior centurions could rise. At this period\r\n          they were not attached to a legion, but to a camp, where more\r\n          than one legion might be quartered. That makes the phrase here\r\n          used curious. The legion is that of the marines now stationed\r\n          in Rome (cp. chaps. 6 and 9). They appear to have joined the\r\n          mutinous Seventeenth cohort when they reached the city.\r\n\r\n    [180] About £40.\r\n\r\n    [181] The insignia of a tribunus were a tunic with a broad or\r\n          narrow stripe (accordingly as they were of senatorial or\r\n          equestrian rank), and a gold ring. A centurion carried a staff\r\n          made of a vine-branch, for disciplinary purposes.\r\n\r\n    [182] One of the three chapels in the temple of Jupiter on the\r\n          Capitoline.\r\n\r\n    [183] The pons Sublicius which led from the Velabrum to\r\n          Janiculum.

Recognizing that the Pennine and Cottian Alps and\r\nall the other passes into Gaul were held by Vitellius, he decided to\r\ninvade Narbonese Gaul by sea. His fleet was now a strong and reliable\r\narm, devoted to his cause. For he had formed the full strength of a\r\nlegion out of the survivors of the Mulvian Bridge massacre,[186] whom\r\nGalba's cruelty had kept in prison, and to all the marines he had\r\nheld out hopes of honourable service.[187] To the fleet he attached\r\nthe cohorts of the City Garrison and a large force of Guards. These\r\nwere the flower of the army and its chief strength, well able to\r\nadvise their own generals and to take good care of them. The command\r\nof the expedition was entrusted to Antonius Novellus and Suedius\r\nClemens, both senior centurions,[188] and to Aemilius Pacensis, to\r\nwhom Otho had restored his commission,[189] of which Galba had\r\ndeprived him. In charge of the fleet he still retained the freedman\r\nMoschus[190] to keep an eye on his betters. In command of the cavalry\r\nand infantry he placed Suetonius Paulinus, Marius Celsus, and Annius\r\nGallus, but the man in whom he put most faith was the Prefect of the\r\nGuards, Licinius Proculus. This officer had shown himself efficient in\r\ngarrison service, but was without any experience of warfare. He\r\nmaligned the characteristic virtues of his colleagues, Paulinus' power\r\nof influence, Celsus' energy, Gallus' ripe judgement, and being a\r\nknave and no fool, he easily got the better of men who were both\r\nhonest and loyal.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Cornelius Dolabella[191] was banished       88\r\nto the colony of Aquinum,[192] though not kept in close or\r\ndishonourable confinement. There was no charge against him: the stigma\r\nupon him was his ancient name and kinship[193] to Galba. Otho issued\r\norders that several of the magistrates and a large number of\r\nex-consuls were to join the expedition, not to take part in the\r\ncampaign or to assist in any way, but simply as a friendly escort.\r\nAmong these was Lucius Vitellius, whom he treated neither as an\r\nemperor's brother nor as the brother of an enemy, but just like\r\nanybody else. Much anxiety was aroused for the safety of the city,\r\nwhere all classes feared danger. The leading members of the senate\r\nwere old and infirm, and enervated by a long period of peace: the\r\naristocracy were inefficient and had forgotten how to fight: the\r\nknights knew nothing of military service. The more they all tried to\r\nconceal their alarm, the more obvious it became. Some of them, on the\r\nother hand, went in for senseless display, and purchased beautiful\r\narmour and fine horses: others procured as provisions of war elaborate\r\ndinner-services or some other contrivance to stimulate a jaded taste.\r\nPrudent men were concerned for the country's peace: the frivolous,\r\nwithout a thought for the future, were inflated by empty hopes: a good\r\nmany, whose loss of credit made peace unwelcome, were delighted at the\r\ngeneral unrest, feeling safer among uncertainties. Though the           89\r\ncares of state were too vast to arouse any interest in the masses, yet\r\nas the price of food rose, and the whole revenue was devoted to\r\nmilitary purposes, the common people gradually began to realize the\r\nevils of war. During the revolt of Vindex they had not suffered so\r\nmuch. Being carried on in the provinces between the legionaries and\r\nthe natives of Gaul it was to all intents a foreign war, and the city\r\nhad not been affected. For from the time when the sainted Augustus\r\norganized the rule of the Caesars the wars of the Roman people had\r\nbeen fought in distant countries: all the anxiety and all the glory\r\nfell to the emperor alone. Under Tiberius and Caligula the country\r\nonly suffered from the evils of peace.[194] Scribonianus' rising\r\nagainst Claudius was no sooner heard of than crushed.[195] Nero had\r\nbeen dethroned more by rumours and dispatches than by force of arms.\r\nBut now not only the legions and the fleet, but, as had seldom\r\nhappened before, the Guards and the City Garrison were called out for\r\nthe campaign. Behind them were the East and the West and all the\r\nforces of the empire, material for a long war under any other\r\ngenerals. An attempt was made to delay Otho's departure by pointing\r\nout the impiety of his not having replaced the sacred shields in the\r\ntemple of Mars.[196] But delay had ruined Nero: Otho would have none\r\nof it. And the knowledge that Caecina had already crossed the\r\nAlps[197] acted as a further stimulus.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the fourteenth of March he commended the                90\r\ngovernment of the country to the senate, and granted to the restored\r\nexiles all the rest of the property confiscated by Nero which had not\r\nyet been sold for the imperial treasury.[198] The gift was a just one,\r\nand made a very good impression, but as a matter of fact it was\r\nnullified by the haste with which the work of collecting the money had\r\nbeen conducted.[199] He then summoned a public meeting, and, after\r\nextolling the majesty of Rome and praising the wholehearted adherence\r\nof the senate and people to his cause, he used very moderate language\r\nagainst the Vitellian party, criticizing the legions more for folly\r\nthan treason, and making no mention of Vitellius himself. This may\r\nhave been due to his own moderation, or it may be that the writer of\r\nthe speech felt some qualms for his own safety, and therefore\r\nrefrained from insulting Vitellius. For it was generally believed that\r\nas in strategy he took the advice of Suetonius Paulinus and Marius\r\nCelsus, so too in political matters he employed the talents of\r\nGalerius Trachalus.[200] Some people even thought they could\r\nrecognize Trachalus' style of oratory, fluent and sonorous, well\r\nadapted to tickle the ears of the crowd: and as he was a popular\r\npleader his style was well known. The crowd's loud shouts of applause\r\nwere in the best style of flattery, excessive and insincere. Men vied\r\nwith each other in their enthusiasm and prayers for his success, much\r\nas though they were sending off the dictator Caesar or the emperor\r\nAugustus. Their motive was neither fear nor affection, but a sheer\r\npassion for servility. One can see the same in households of slaves,\r\nwhere each obeys his own interest and the common welfare counts for\r\nnothing. On his departure Otho entrusted the peace of the city and the\r\ninterests of the empire to his brother Salvius Titianus.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [185] He would lead the victim, before sacrificing it, round\r\n          the ancient boundary of the city, and thus avert the disasters\r\n          threatened by the alarming omens detailed in the last chapter.\r\n\r\n    [186] Cp. chaps. 6 and 37.\r\n\r\n    [187] i.e. of becoming eventually a legion or praetorian cohort.\r\n\r\n    [188] Cp. note 57.\r\n\r\n    [189] The command of a cohort in the City Garrison.\r\n\r\n    [190] He had held this post under Nero and Galba.

Quintilian alludes several times to the\r\n    extreme beauty of his voice and his commanding\r\n    delivery--better, he thinks, than that of any tragedian he had\r\n    ever seen. To read, his speeches were less effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\nVESPASIAN AND THE EAST\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the other side of Europe, Fortune was already sowing       1\r\nthe seeds of a dynasty, the varying fortunes of which were destined to\r\nbring at one time happiness to the country and success to its rulers,\r\nat another misery to the country and to the rulers destruction.[201]\r\nBefore Galba's fall Titus Vespasianus had been dispatched by his\r\nfather from Judaea to Rome.[202] The ostensible reason of his journey\r\nwas to show respect to the new emperor, and to solicit some post for\r\nwhich his years now fitted him.[203] However, the popular passion for\r\ninvention suggested that he had been summoned to be adopted. This\r\nrumour was based on the fact that Galba was old and childless: the\r\npublic never wearies of appointing successors until the choice is\r\nmade. The character of Titus gave still more colour to it. He seemed\r\ncapable of filling any position. His appearance lacked neither charm\r\nnor dignity. Vespasian's successes also and the utterances of certain\r\noracles further endorsed the rumour, to say nothing of the chance\r\noccurrences which pass for omens where the wish is father to the\r\nthought. It was at Corinth in Achaia that Titus received the news of\r\nGalba's murder, and was assured by people in the town that Vitellius\r\nhad declared war. In great perplexity he summoned a few of his friends\r\nand discussed all the possibilities of the situation. If he continued\r\nhis journey to Rome he would earn no gratitude for compliments\r\naddressed to another sovereign,[204] and would be held as a hostage\r\neither for Vitellius or for Otho: on the other hand, if he returned to\r\nJudaea he would inevitably offend the victor. However, the struggle\r\nwas still undecided, and the father's adherence to the successful\r\nparty would excuse the conduct of the son. Or if Vespasian himself\r\nassumed sovereignty, they would have to plan war and forget all about\r\ngiving offence.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations held him balanced between hope and fear; but         2\r\nultimately hope prevailed. Some people believed that his longing to\r\nget back to Queen Berenice[205] fired him to return. True, the young\r\nman's fancy was attracted by Berenice, but he did not allow this to\r\ninterfere with business. Still his youth was a time of gay\r\nself-indulgence, and he showed more restraint in his own reign than in\r\nhis father's. Accordingly he sailed along the coasts of Greece and\r\nAsia Minor, and, skirting the seas which lay upon his left, reached\r\nthe islands of Rhodes and Cyprus, whence he made a bolder crossing to\r\nSyria.[206] On his way he conceived a desire to visit the temple of\r\nVenus at Paphos,[207] which is famous among all the inhabitants and\r\nvisitors. It may not be tedious to give here a short account of the\r\norigin of this worship, the ritual of the cult, and the\r\nshape--unparalleled elsewhere--in which the goddess is depicted.\r\n\r\nAccording to an old tradition the temple was founded by King             3\r\nAerias, and some people maintain that the goddess bears the same name.\r\nA more modern version states that the temple was consecrated by\r\nCinyras,[208] on the spot where the goddess landed when the sea gave\r\nher birth. The method of divination,[209] however, according to this\r\naccount, was imported from elsewhere by the Cilician Tamiras, and an\r\narrangement was made that the descendants of both families should\r\npreside over the rites. Later, however, it seemed wrong that the royal\r\nline should have no prerogative, so the descendants of the\r\nforeigner[210] resigned the practice of the art which they had\r\nthemselves introduced, and now the priest whom you consult is always\r\nof the line of Cinyras. They accept any victim that is offered, but\r\nmales are preferred. They put most faith in kids' entrails. Blood\r\nmust not be poured on the altar, at which they offer only prayers and\r\nfire untainted by smoke. Although the altars stand in the open air\r\nthey are never wetted by rain. The goddess is not represented in human\r\nform; the idol is a sort of circular pyramid,[211] rising from a broad\r\nbase to a small round top, like a turning-post. The reason of this is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nTitus inspected the temple treasures and the offerings made by           4\r\nvarious kings, and other curiosities which the Greek passion for\r\narchaeology attributes to a dim antiquity. He then consulted the\r\noracle first about his voyage. Learning that the sea was calm, and\r\nthat no obstacles stood in his way, he sacrificed a large number of\r\nvictims, and put covert questions about his own fortunes. The priest,\r\nwhose name was Sostratus, seeing that the entrails were uniformly\r\nfavourable, and that the goddess assented to Titus' ambitious schemes,\r\nreturned at the moment a brief and ordinary reply, but afterwards\r\nsought a private interview and revealed the future to him. So Titus\r\nreturned to his father with heightened hopes, and amid the general\r\nanxiety of the provinces and their armies his arrival spread boundless\r\nconfidence of success.\r\n\r\nVespasian had already broken the back of the Jewish war.[212] Only the\r\nsiege of Jerusalem remained. That this proved a difficult and\r\nlaborious task was due rather to the high situation of the town and\r\nthe stubborn superstition of its inhabitants than to any adequate\r\nprovision enabling them to endure the hardships of the siege.\r\nVespasian had, as we have already stated,[213] three legions well\r\ntried in war. Four others were under Mucianus' command.[213] Although\r\nthese had never seen war, yet their envy of the neighbouring army's\r\nfame had banished sloth. Indeed, as the former were hardened by work\r\nand danger, so the latter owed their ardour to their unbroken\r\ninaction, and their shame at having no share in the war.[214] Both\r\ngenerals had, besides auxiliary infantry and cavalry, foreign\r\nfleets[215] and allied princes,[216] and a fame that rested on widely\r\ndiffering claims. Vespasian was an indefatigable campaigner. He          5\r\nheaded the column, chose the camping-ground, never ceasing by night or\r\nday to use strategy, and, if need be, the sword to thwart the enemy.\r\nHe eat what he could get, and dressed almost like a common soldier.\r\nIndeed, save for his avarice, he matched the generals of old days.\r\nMucianus, on the other hand, was distinguished by his wealth and\r\nluxury, and his general superiority to the standards of a private\r\nperson. He was the better speaker, and a skilful administrator and\r\nstatesman. Their combined qualities would have made a fine emperor,\r\nif one could have blended their virtues and omitted their vices.\r\nGoverning as they did the neighbouring provinces of Judaea and Syria,\r\njealousy at first led to quarrels. However, on the death of Nero, they\r\nforgot their dislike and joined hands. It was their friends who first\r\nbrought them together, and subsequently Titus became the chief bond of\r\nunion and for the common good suppressed their ignoble jealousy. Both\r\nby nature and training he had charm to fascinate even such a man as\r\nMucianus. The tribunes and centurions and the common soldiers were\r\nattracted, each according to his character, either by Titus'\r\nmeritorious industry or by his gay indulgence in pleasure.\r\n\r\nBefore the arrival of Titus both armies had sworn allegiance to          6\r\nOtho. News travels fast in such cases, but civil war is a slow and\r\nserious undertaking, and the East, after its long repose, was now for\r\nthe first time beginning to arm for it. In earlier times all the\r\nfiercest civil wars broke out in Italy or Cisalpine Gaul among the\r\nforces of the West. Pompey, Cassius, Brutus, and Antony all courted\r\ndisaster by carrying the war oversea. Syria and Judaea often heard of\r\nCaesars, but seldom saw one. There were no mutinies among the\r\nsoldiers. They merely made demonstrations against Parthia with varying\r\nsuccess. Even in the last civil war[217] the peace of these provinces\r\nhad been untroubled by the general confusion. Later they were loyal to\r\nGalba. But when they heard that Otho and Vitellius were engaged in a\r\nwicked contest for the possession of the Roman world, the troops\r\nbegan to chafe at the thought that the prizes of empire should fall to\r\nothers, while their own lot was mere compulsory submission. They began\r\nto take stock of their strength. Syria and Judaea had seven legions on\r\nthe spot with a vast force of auxiliaries. Next came Egypt with two\r\nlegions:[218] beyond lay Cappadocia and Pontus, and all the forts\r\nalong the Armenian frontier. Asia and the remaining provinces were\r\nrich and thickly populated. As for the islands, their girdle of sea\r\nwas safe from the enemy and aided the prosecution of the war.\r\n\r\nThe generals were well aware of the soldiers' feelings, but decided      7\r\nto await the issue between Vitellius and Otho. 'In civil war,' they\r\nreckoned, 'there are no sure ties to unite victor and vanquished. It\r\nmatters little which survives: even good generals are corrupted by\r\nsuccess: as for Otho and Vitellius, their troops are quarrelsome,\r\nlazy, and luxurious, and they are both the victims of their own vices.\r\nOne will fall on the field and the other succumb to his success.' So\r\nVespasian and Mucianus postponed their attack for the present. They\r\nwere themselves recent converts to the project of war, which the\r\nothers[219] had long fostered from various motives. The better sort\r\nwere animated by patriotism, many by mere love of plunder, some by the\r\nuncertainty of their own fortunes. Thus, though their motives\r\ndiffered, all, good and bad alike, agreed in their eager desire for\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Achaia and Asia were thrown into 8 a groundless panic\r\nby a rumour that 'Nero was at hand'. The accounts of his death being\r\nmany and various, people were all the more inclined to allege and to\r\nbelieve that he was still alive. We shall mention in the course of\r\nthis work the attempts and the fate of the other pretenders.[220] This\r\ntime it was a slave from Pontus, or, according to other traditions, a\r\nfreedman from Italy. His skill as a singer and harpist, combined with\r\nhis facial resemblance to Nero, gave him some credentials for\r\nimposture. He bribed some penniless and vagabond deserters by dazzling\r\npromises to join him, and they all set out to sea. A storm drove them\r\non to the island of Cythnus,[221] where he found some troops homeward\r\nbound on leave from the East. Some of these he enrolled, killing all\r\nwho resisted, and then proceeded to plunder the local merchants and\r\narm all the sturdiest of the slaves. Finding a centurion named Sisenna\r\ncarrying home a pair of silver hands[222] as a token of alliance from\r\nthe army in Syria to the Household Guards, he tried by various devices\r\nto seduce him, until Sisenna took fright and escaped secretly from the\r\nisland in fear of violence. Thus the panic spread. The great name of\r\nNero attracted many who pined for revolution and hated the existing\r\nstate of things. The rumours waxed daily, until a chance dispelled\r\nthem. Galba had entrusted the government of Galatia and                  9\r\nPamphylia[223] to Calpurnius Asprenas, who had been granted an escort\r\nof two triremes from the fleet at Misenum. It so happened that with\r\nthese he touched at Cythnus. The rebels lost no time in appealing to\r\nthe ship's captains in the name of Nero. The pretender, assuming an\r\nair of melancholy, appealed to 'the loyalty of his former soldiers',\r\nand begged them to establish him in Syria or Egypt. The captains\r\neither from sympathy or guile alleged that they must talk to their\r\nmen, and would come back when they had prepared all their minds.\r\nHowever, they faithfully made a full report to Asprenas, on whose\r\ninstructions they boarded the ship and killed the impostor, whoever he\r\nwas. The man's eyes and hair and ferocious look were so remarkable\r\nthat the body was carried into Asia and thence to Rome.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [201] The Flavian dynasty.

It happened that Vibius Crispus,[224] a man whose wealth,\r\ninfluence, and ability had won him a reputation that was great rather\r\nthan good, had impeached before the senate a man of equestrian rank,\r\ncalled Annius Faustus, who had been a professional informer under\r\nNero. The senate had recently in Galba's principate passed a\r\nresolution authorizing the prosecution of informers. This resolution\r\nhad been variously applied from time to time, and interpreted\r\nrigorously or leniently according as the defendant was helpless or\r\ninfluential. But it still retained some terrors. Crispus, moreover,\r\nhad exerted all his powers to secure the conviction of the man who had\r\ninformed against his brother.[225] He had, in fact, induced a large\r\nproportion of the senate to demand that Faustus should be sent to\r\nexecution undefended and unheard. However, with others, the defendant\r\ngained a great advantage from his prosecutor's undue influence. 'We\r\nmust give him time,' they argued, 'the charges must be published:\r\nhowever hateful the criminal his case must be properly heard.' At\r\nfirst this advice prevailed. The trial was postponed for a few days.\r\nAt length came the conviction of Faustus, which aroused in the country\r\nless satisfaction than his vile character warranted. People recalled\r\nthe fact that Crispus himself had turned informer with pecuniary\r\nprofit. It was not the penalty but the prosecutor that was unpopular.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [224] A close friend of Vespasian, who was supposed to ply the\r\n          trade of informer (cp. iv. 41 and 43).\r\n\r\n    [225] Vibius Secundus, banished for extortion in Mauretania.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHO'S MEASURES OF DEFENCE\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the war opened successfully for Otho. At his order the        11\r\narmies of Dalmatia and Pannonia started from their base. They\r\ncomprised four legions,[226] each of which had sent forward\r\ndetachments two thousand strong. The rest followed at a short\r\ninterval: the Seventh legion raised by Galba,[227] the Eleventh and\r\nThirteenth, both composed of veteran troops, and the Fourteenth, which\r\nhad won great distinction by crushing the rebellion in Britain.[228]\r\nNero had further increased their glory by choosing them for special\r\nservice,[229] which accounts for their lasting loyalty to Nero and\r\ntheir keen support of Otho. But the stronger their numbers the greater\r\ntheir self-confidence and the slower their march. The cavalry and\r\nauxiliaries preceded the main body of the legions. From Rome itself\r\ncame no mean force, five regiments of Guards with some detachments of\r\ncavalry and the First legion.[230] To these were added an irregular\r\nforce of 2,000 gladiators,[231] a shameful assistance of which during\r\nthe civil wars even strict generals availed themselves. Annius Gallus\r\nwas placed in command of these forces with Vestricius Spurinna,[232]\r\nand they were sent forward to hold the line of the Po. Their first\r\nplans had failed, Caecina, whom Otho had hoped to hold within the\r\nGallic provinces, having already crossed the Alps.[233] Under Otho's\r\npersonal command marched picked detachments of his Body Guard and the\r\nrest of the Household troops, together with reservists of the Guard\r\nand a large force of marines.[234] He let no luxury either delay or\r\ndisgrace his march. In an iron breast-plate he marched on foot at the\r\nhead of his troops, looking rough and dishevelled, quite unlike his\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nFortune smiled on his first efforts. By sea his fleet held most of      12\r\nthe Italian coast right up to the foot of the Maritime Alps. To secure\r\nthese mountains and attack the province of Narbonese Gaul he had\r\nplaced in command Suedius Clemens, Antonius Novellus, and Aemilius\r\nPacensis.[235] Pacensis, however, was made a prisoner by his mutinous\r\ntroops: Novellus had no authority: Clemens' command rested on\r\npopularity, and he was as greedy of battle as he was criminally blind\r\nto insubordination. No one could have imagined they were in Italy, on\r\nthe soil of their native land. As though on foreign shores and among\r\nan enemy's towns, they burnt, ravaged, plundered, with results all the\r\nmore horrible since no precautions had been taken against danger. The\r\nfields were full, the houses open. The inhabitants came to meet them\r\nwith their wives and children, and were lured by the security of\r\npeace into all the horrors of war. The Governor of the Maritime\r\nAlps[236] at that time was Marius Maturus. He summoned the\r\ninhabitants, whose fighting strength was ample, and proposed to resist\r\nat the frontier the Othonians' invasion of the province. But at the\r\nfirst engagement the mountaineers were cut down and dispersed. They\r\nhad assembled in random haste; they knew nothing of military service\r\nor discipline, nothing of the glory of victory or the disgrace of\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nEnraged by this engagement, Otho's troops visited their                 13\r\nindignation on the town of Albintimilium.[237] The battle had brought\r\nthem no booty, for the peasants were poor and their armour worthless,\r\nand being swift of foot, with a good knowledge of the country, they\r\nhad escaped capture. However, the soldiers sated their greed at the\r\nexpense of the innocent town. A Ligurian woman afforded a fine example\r\nof courage which made their conduct the more odious. She had concealed\r\nher son, and when the soldiers, who believed that she had hidden some\r\nmoney as well, demanded from her under torture where she was keeping\r\nhim concealed, she pointed to her belly and replied, 'He is in\r\nhiding.' No subsequent tortures nor even death itself could bring her\r\nto change that brave and noble answer.\r\n\r\nPanic-stricken couriers brought to Fabius Valens the news that          14\r\nOtho's fleet was threatening the province of Narbonese Gaul, which had\r\nsworn allegiance to Vitellius. Representatives from the Roman colonies\r\nalso arrived beseeching his aid. He dispatched two cohorts of the\r\nTungri[238] and four troops of horse, together with the entire cavalry\r\nregiment of the Treviri.[239] This force was put under the command of\r\nJulius Classicus,[240] and part of it was detained in the colony of\r\nForum Julii,[241] since if the whole force marched inland and the\r\nsea-board were left unprotected Otho's fleet would swoop down at once.\r\nTwelve troops of cavalry and a picked body of auxiliaries marched\r\nagainst the enemy: these were reinforced by a Ligurian cohort which\r\nhad long garrisoned this district, and a draft of five hundred\r\nPannonian recruits who had not yet joined their legion.[242] The\r\nengagement began promptly. Their line was so arranged that some of the\r\nmarines, reinforced by the peasants, held the rising ground by the\r\nsea, while the Guards filled the level space between the hills and the\r\nshore. The fleet, acting in conjunction with the land force, was ready\r\nto play its part in the battle, and extended a threatening front\r\nfacing the coast. The Vitellians, weaker in infantry, put their trust\r\nin their horse. The mountaineers[243] were posted on the neighbouring\r\nheights, and the auxiliaries massed in close order behind the cavalry.\r\nThe Treviran cavalry rashly charged the enemy, and meeting Otho's\r\nguards in front were simultaneously assailed in the flank by the\r\npeasants, flinging stones. This they could do well enough; and,\r\ndrafted among the regulars, they all, bold and timid alike, showed the\r\nsame courage in the hour of victory. Panic struck the defeated\r\nVitellians when the fleet began to harass their rear. They were now\r\nsurrounded, and would have been entirely destroyed had not darkness\r\narrested the victors and sheltered their flight. But though beaten      15\r\nthe Vitellians were not cowed. Calling up reinforcements, they\r\nsuddenly attacked while the unsuspecting enemy were taking their ease\r\nafter the victory. They killed the pickets, broke into the camp and\r\nterrified the sailors. In time the panic subsided. The Othonians\r\nseized a hill, defended their position, and eventually assumed the\r\noffensive. The slaughter was frightful. The officers commanding the\r\nTungri, after a long defence of their position, fell beneath a shower\r\nof weapons. The victory also cost the Othonians heavy loss, for the\r\nenemy's cavalry rallied and cut off all who rashly ventured too far in\r\npursuit. So they agreed to a sort of armistice. As a safeguard against\r\nsudden raids either by the fleet on the one side or the cavalry on the\r\nother, the Vitellians retired to Antipolis,[244] a town of the\r\nNarbonese province, and the Othonians to Albingaunum[245] in the\r\ninterior of Liguria.\r\n\r\nThe fame of this naval victory kept Corsica and Sardinia and the        16\r\nadjacent islands faithful to Otho's cause. However, Decumus Pacarius,\r\nthe procurator,[246] nearly ruined Corsica by an act of indiscretion,\r\nwhich in a war of such dimensions could not possibly have affected the\r\nissue, and only ended in his own destruction. He hated Otho and\r\ndetermined to aid Vitellius with all the forces of Corsica; a useless\r\nassistance, even if it had been forthcoming. He summoned the chief men\r\nof the island and disclosed his project. Claudius Pyrrhicus, who\r\ncommanded the Liburnian cruisers[247] stationed there, and a Roman\r\nknight named Quintius Certus ventured to oppose him. He ordered their\r\nexecution. This overawed the others who were present. So they swore\r\nallegiance to Vitellius, as did also the general mass of ignorant\r\npeople, who blindly shared a fear they did not feel. However, when\r\nPacarius began to enlist them and to harass his undisciplined men with\r\nmilitary duties, their loathing for the unwonted labour set them\r\nthinking of their weakness. 'They lived in an island: Vitellius'\r\nlegions were in Germany, a long way off: Otho's fleet had already\r\nsacked and plundered districts that had even horse and foot to protect\r\nthem.' The revulsion was sudden, but did not issue in overt\r\nresistance. They chose a suitable moment for their treachery. Waiting\r\ntill Pacarius' visitors[248] were gone, they murdered him, stripped\r\nand helpless, in his bath, and killed his comrades too. The heads they\r\nbore themselves to Otho, like enemies' scalps. Neither did Otho reward\r\nnor Vitellius punish them. In the general confusion their deed was\r\novershadowed by more heinous crimes.\r\n\r\nWe have already described[249] how 'Silius' Horse' had admitted the     17\r\nwar into the heart of Italy. No one there either supported Otho or\r\npreferred Vitellius. But prolonged peace had broken their spirits to\r\nutter servility. They were an easy prey to the first comer and cared\r\nlittle who was the better man. All the fields and cities between the\r\nAlps and the Po, the most fertile district in Italy, were held by the\r\nVitellian forces, the cohorts sent forward by Caecina[249] having\r\nalready arrived. One of the Pannonian cohorts had been captured at\r\nCremona: a hundred cavalry and a thousand marines had been cut off\r\nbetween Placentia and Ticinum.[250] After this success the river and\r\nits steep banks were no barrier to the Vitellian troops: indeed the\r\nBatavians and other Germans found the Po a positive temptation.\r\nCrossing suddenly opposite Placentia, they captured a handful of\r\nscouts and created such a panic that the others in terror spread the\r\nfalse report that Caecina's whole army was upon them.\r\n\r\nSpurinna, who was holding Placentia, had made up his mind that          18\r\nCaecina had not yet arrived, and that, if he should, his troops must\r\nbe kept within their lines: he could not pit three cohorts of guards\r\nwith one detachment a thousand strong,[251] and a few cavalry, against\r\nCaecina's veteran army. But his men were unruly and ignorant of\r\nwar.[252] Seizing the standards and colours[253] they broke out,\r\nthreatening to kill the general who tried to check them and paying no\r\nheed to their superior officers. They even clamoured that Otho was\r\nbeing betrayed, and Caecina had been summoned.[254] Spurinna yielded\r\nunwillingly to their folly, at first under compulsion, later with a\r\nshow of sympathy. He was anxious to gain weight for his advice,\r\nshould the mutiny cool.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall, with the Po in sight, Spurinna decided to entrench        19\r\nhis camp.[255] The unaccustomed hard work soon blunted the enthusiasm\r\nof his town-bred troops. The older men began to curse their credulity,\r\nand to point out the fearful danger to their small force of being\r\nsurrounded by Caecina's army in the open country. Soon a more sober\r\nspirit pervaded the camp. The tribunes and centurions mingled with the\r\nmen, and every one talked with admiration of Spurinna's foresight in\r\nselecting a powerful and wealthy colony as a strong base for their\r\noperations. Finally Spurinna himself rather explained his plans than\r\nreproached their faults, and, leaving patrols behind, succeeded\r\neventually in leading the rest of the men back to Placentia in a\r\nquieter and more submissive frame of mind. There the walls were\r\nrepaired, outworks built, and the turrets increased in height and\r\nnumber, while Spurinna provided not only for arms and ammunition but\r\nalso for obedience and discipline. This was all his party lacked, for\r\ntheir courage was unimpeachable.\r\n\r\nCaecina, on the other hand, seemed to have left his cruelty and         20\r\nprofligacy on the other side of the Alps. He marched through Italy\r\nwith a well-disciplined force. The people in the country-towns and\r\ncolonies took offence at his costume as showing arrogance. While they\r\nwore the plain toga, Caecina addressed them attired in a\r\nparti-coloured plaid and trousers.[256] Moreover, his wife Salonina\r\nrode on a fine horse with purple trappings, and though this did no one\r\nany harm, they grumbled and seemed hurt. It is an ineradicable human\r\ntrait to turn critical eyes on new-found fortune, and to insist upon\r\nmoderation most of all in those who used to be our equals. Crossing\r\nthe Po, Caecina tried to undermine the loyalty of the Othonians by\r\nnegotiations and promises. They retaliated with the same weapons, and\r\nwhen they had finished bandying empty and fine-sounding phrases about\r\nPeace and Union, Caecina devoted all his attention and plans to an\r\nassault on Placentia in terrific force. He knew that his future\r\nreputation rested on the issue of his first engagements.[257]\r\n\r\nBut the first day's work savoured more of impatience than of a          21\r\nveteran army's methods. The men ventured under the walls without cover\r\nor precaution, drunk and overfed. Meanwhile the amphitheatre, a fine\r\nbuilding outside the walls, was burnt down. It was set on fire either\r\nby the attacking force hurling torches and heated shot and\r\nfire-brands, or by the besieged in returning their fire. The common\r\npeople of the town harboured a suspicion that fuel for the fire had\r\nbeen surreptitiously introduced from one of the neighbouring colonies,\r\nand that the motive was jealousy, since no building in Italy could\r\nhold so many people. However it happened, they thought little of it,\r\nwhile worse disasters threatened: safety assured, they bewailed it as\r\nthe worst calamity they could have suffered. To return, however, to\r\nCaecina: he was repulsed with heavy losses, and the night was spent in\r\npreparations. The Vitellians provided mantlets, fascines, and\r\npenthouses,[258] to protect the assailants while undermining the\r\nwalls: the Othonians procured stakes and huge masses of stone or lead\r\nor brass, to break through the enemy's formation and crush them to\r\npieces. Both parties were actuated by feelings of pride and ambition.\r\nVarious encouragements were used, one side praising the strength of\r\nthe legions and the German army, the other the reputation of the\r\nGuards and the City Garrison. The Vitellians decried their enemy as\r\nlazy effeminates demoralized by the circus and the theatre: to which\r\nthey replied that the Vitellians were a pack of foreigners and\r\nbarbarians. Meanwhile, Otho and Vitellius were held up to praise or\r\nblame, insult providing the more fruitful stimulus.\r\n\r\nHardly had day dawned before the walls of Placentia bristled with       22\r\ndefenders, and the fields glittered with the soldiers' armour. The\r\nVitellian legions[259] advancing in close order with their auxiliaries\r\nin scattered bands assailed the higher portions of the walls with\r\nstones and arrows: where the walls were in disrepair or crumbling from\r\nage they came close up to them. The Othonians above, poising and\r\naiming their weapons with surer effect, rained them down on the\r\nGermans, who came rashly charging under the walls with the wild songs\r\nand scanty dress of their country, brandishing their shields over\r\ntheir heads. Meanwhile, the legionaries under cover of their mantlets\r\nand fascines set to work to undermine the walls, build up a mound, and\r\nassail the gates, while Otho's Guards rolled on to them with terrific\r\ncrashes huge millstones, which they had arranged for this purpose\r\nalong the walls. Of those beneath, some were crushed by the stones;\r\nothers, wounded by darts, were left mangled and bleeding to death.\r\nPanic redoubled the slaughter, and the rain of missiles came all the\r\nfiercer from the walls. At last they sacrificed the honour of their\r\nparty and beat a retreat. Caecina, ashamed of his rash attempt at\r\nassault, was afraid of looking ridiculous and useless if he sat still\r\nin the same camp. So he crossed the Po and made for Cremona. As he\r\nwas retiring, Turullius Cerialis with a large force of marines, and\r\nJulius Briganticus[260] with a few cavalry, came over to his side. The\r\nlatter, a Batavian born, had held a cavalry command: the former was a\r\nsenior centurion, who was known to Caecina, as he had served in that\r\ncapacity in Germany.\r\n\r\nSpurinna, learning the enemy's route, informed Annius Gallus[261]       23\r\nby letter of all that had happened, the defence of Placentia and\r\nCaecina's plans. Gallus was leading the First legion to the relief of\r\nPlacentia, for he doubted the ability of the weak force of Guards to\r\nresist a long siege and the full strength of the German army. Hearing\r\nthat Caecina was defeated and making for Cremona, he halted at\r\nBedriacum, though he found it hard to restrain the ardour of his\r\ntroops, whose zeal for battle nearly broke into mutiny. The village of\r\nBedriacum lies between Verona and Cremona,[262] and two Roman\r\ndisasters have now given it a sinister notoriety.\r\n\r\nIn the same week Martius Macer[263] gained a victory in the\r\nneighbourhood of Cremona. With great enterprise he had transported his\r\ngladiators across the Po, and suddenly flung them on to the opposite\r\nbank. There they routed the Vitellian auxiliaries and killed all who\r\noffered resistance, the rest taking flight to Cremona. But Macer\r\nchecked their victorious ardour, for fear that the enemy might be\r\nreinforced and reverse the fortune of the battle. This aroused\r\nsuspicion among the Othonians, who put a bad construction on all that\r\ntheir generals did. All the least courageous and most impudent of the\r\ntroops vied incessantly with each other in bringing various charges\r\nagainst Annius Gallus, Suetonius Paulinus, and Marius Celsus, for the\r\ntwo latter had also been placed in command by Otho.[264] The most\r\nenergetic in promoting mutiny and dissension were Galba's murderers,\r\nwho, maddened by their feelings of fear and of guilt, created endless\r\ndisorder, sometimes talking open sedition, sometimes sending anonymous\r\nletters to Otho. As he always believed men of the meaner sort and\r\ndistrusted patriots, he now wavered nervously, being always irresolute\r\nin success and firmer in the face of danger. He therefore sent for his\r\nbrother Titianus[265] and gave him the chief command.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile success attended the generalship of Paulinus and              24\r\nCelsus.[266] Caecina was tortured by his constant failure and the\r\nwaning reputation of his army. Repulsed from Placentia, he had lately\r\nseen his auxiliaries defeated, and his patrols constantly worsted in\r\nskirmishes more frequent than memorable. Now that Fabius Valens was\r\nclose at hand, he determined not to let all the glory of the war fall\r\nto him, and hastened with more zeal than prudence to retrieve his\r\nreputation. About twelve miles[267] distant from Cremona, at a place\r\ncalled _Twin Brethren_,[268] he carefully concealed the bravest of his\r\nauxiliaries in a wood overlooking the road. The cavalry were ordered\r\nto ride forward down the road and provoke an engagement. They were\r\nthen to feign flight and lure the pursuers on in hot haste until they\r\nfell into the ambush. This plan was betrayed to Otho's generals.\r\nPaulinus took charge of the infantry, Celsus of the horse. A\r\ndetachment of the Thirteenth legion,[269] four auxiliary cohorts of\r\nfoot, and five hundred cavalry were stationed on the left flank. Three\r\ncohorts of the Guards in column occupied the raised high-road.[270] On\r\nthe right flank marched the First legion, two auxiliary cohorts of\r\nfoot, and five hundred cavalry. Besides these they moved out a\r\nthousand cavalry--Guards and auxiliaries--as a reserve to crown their\r\nsuccess, or assist them in difficulties.\r\n\r\nBefore they came to close quarters, the Vitellians began to             25\r\nretire. Celsus, forewarned of the ruse, halted his men. Whereupon the\r\nVitellians impatiently rose from their ambush and, while Celsus slowly\r\nretired, followed him further and further until they plunged headlong\r\ninto an ambush themselves. The auxiliaries were on their flanks; the\r\nlegions faced them in front; and the cavalry by a sudden manoeuvre had\r\nclosed in on their rear. However, Suetonius Paulinus did not\r\nimmediately give the signal for his infantry to charge. He was by\r\nnature dilatory, and preferred cautiously reasoned measures to\r\naccidental success. He kept on issuing orders about filling up the\r\nditches, clearing the fields and extending the line, convinced that it\r\nwas soon enough to play for victory when he had taken every precaution\r\nagainst defeat. This delay gave the Vitellians time to take refuge in\r\nthe vineyards, where the interlaced vine-stems made it hard to follow.\r\nAdjoining these was a little wood, from under cover of which they\r\nventured another sally and killed the foremost of the Guards' cavalry.\r\nThere Prince Epiphanes[271] was wounded, while making vigorous efforts\r\nto rally Otho's forces.\r\n\r\nAt this point Otho's infantry charged, crushed the opposing line,       26\r\nand even routed the troops who were hurrying up in support. For\r\nCaecina had brought up his reinforcements not all at once but in\r\nseparate detachments. These, arriving in scattered units, and never in\r\nsufficient force, only added to the confusion, since the panic of the\r\nrout infected them as well. Mutiny, too, broke out in the camp,\r\nbecause the troops were not all taken into battle. Julius Gratus, the\r\ncamp-prefect, was put in irons on a charge of plotting with his\r\nbrother, who was fighting on Otho's side. It was known that the\r\nOthonians had arrested the brother, Julius Fronto, on the same charge.\r\nFor the rest, such was the universal panic among pursuers and pursued,\r\non the field and in the camp, that it was commonly said on both sides\r\nthat, if Suetonius Paulinus had not sounded the retreat, Caecina's\r\nwhole army might have been destroyed. Paulinus maintained that he\r\navoided any excessive strain of work or marching, for fear of exposing\r\nhis exhausted troops to a counter-attack from the Vitellians in the\r\ncamp, who were still fresh for battle: besides, he had no reserves to\r\nfall back on in case of defeat. A few approved of the general's\r\nstrategy, but the common opinion was adverse.[272]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [226] See note 3.\r\n\r\n    [227] The legion brought from Spain, mentioned in i. 6.\r\n\r\n    [228] The revolt of Boadicea crushed by Suetonius Paulinus;\r\n          described by Tacitus in his life of Agricola and in Book XIV\r\n          of the _Annals_.\r\n\r\n    [229] i.e. for his projected war against the Albanians (cp. i.\r\n          6).

If _procurator_ is\r\n          correct here, Pacarius must have been a subordinate imperial\r\n          functionary in a senatorial province. As the province changed\r\n          hands so often and was so soon after this placed under\r\n          imperial control, it is possible that Tacitus made a mistake\r\n          and that Pacarius was an ex-praetor. Those who feel that\r\n          Tacitus is unlikely to have made this error, and that Pacarius\r\n          can hardly have been anything but governor, adopt the\r\n          suggestion that Corsica did not share the fate of Sardinia in\r\n          A.D. 67, but remained under the control of an imperial\r\n          procurator.

Henderson, _Civil War_, &c.).\r\n          But Mr. E.G. Hardy points out that, as he had only 4,000 men\r\n          and Caecina's 30,000 were in the immediate neighbourhood, this\r\n          would have been foolish. It seems better to believe Tacitus'\r\n          suggestion that his insubordinate troops forced Spurinna to\r\n          march out.\r\n\r\n    [256] Considered Gallic and effeminate.\r\n\r\n    [257] Mr. Henderson (_Civil War_, &c.) argues that it was\r\n          imperative for Caecina to take the fortress at Placentia,\r\n          since it threatened his sole line of communication with\r\n          Valens' column.

It is written for the plain man with an eye\r\n          for situations and an ear for phrases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECISIVE STRUGGLE\r\n\r\nThis reverse reduced the Vitellians not to despair but to               27\r\ndiscipline. Not only was this the case in Caecina's camp, who blamed\r\nhis men as being readier for mutiny than for battle, but the troops\r\nunder Fabius Valens, who had now reached Ticinum,[273] lost their\r\ncontempt for the enemy, conceived a desire to retrieve their glory,\r\nand offered their general a more respectful and steady obedience.\r\nThere had, indeed, been a serious outbreak of mutiny, the account of\r\nwhich I may now resume from an earlier chapter,[274] where it seemed\r\nwrong to break the narrative of Caecina's operations. The Batavian\r\nauxiliaries, who had left the Fourteenth legion during the war against\r\nVindex, heard of Vitellius' rising while on their way to Britain, and,\r\nas I have already described,[275] joined Fabius Valens in the country\r\nof the Lingones. There they grew insolent. Whenever they passed the\r\ntents of the Roman soldiers, they boasted loudly that they had coerced\r\nthe Fourteenth, had deprived Nero of Italy, and held the whole issue\r\nof the war in the hollow of their hand. This insulted the soldiers and\r\nannoyed the general; brawls and quarrels ruined good discipline.\r\nUltimately Valens began to suspect that their insubordination meant\r\ntreachery. Accordingly, on receiving the news that Otho's fleet         28\r\nhad defeated the Treviran cavalry[276] and the Tungri, and was now\r\nblockading Narbonese Gaul, he determined at the same time to assist\r\nhis allies, and by a stroke of generalship to separate contingents\r\nthat were so insubordinate and, if united, so strong. He therefore\r\nordered the Batavians to march to the support of Narbo. Immediately\r\nthis order became generally known, the auxiliaries began to complain\r\nand the legionaries to chafe. 'They were being deprived of their\r\nstrongest support: here were these invincible veterans promptly\r\nwithdrawn directly the enemy came in sight: if the province was more\r\nimportant than the safety of Rome and the empire, why not all go\r\nthere? but if Italy was the corner-stone of their success, he ought\r\nnot as it were to amputate their strongest limb.'[277] In answer        29\r\nto this presumptuous criticism, Valens loosed his lictors upon them\r\nand set to work to check the mutiny. They attacked their general,\r\nstoned him, and chased him out of the camp, shouting that he was\r\nconcealing the spoils of Gaul and the gold from Vienne,[278] the due\r\nreward of their labours. They looted the baggage, ransacked the\r\ngeneral's quarters, and even rummaged in the ground with javelins and\r\nlances. Valens, in slave's dress, took refuge with a cavalry officer.\r\nGradually the disorder began to die down. Alfenus Varus, the\r\ncamp-prefect, then hit upon the plan of forbidding the centurions to\r\ngo the rounds or to have the bugle sounded to summon the men to their\r\nduties. No one had anything to do: they eyed each other in\r\nastonishment, dismayed above all at having no one to command them. At\r\nfirst by silent submission, at last with tearful prayers, they sought\r\npardon. Valens appeared, haggard and in tears, but above all\r\nexpectation safe and sound,--joy, sympathy, cheers! With a wild\r\nrevulsion of feeling--mobs are always extravagant--they made a ring\r\nround him with the eagles and standards, and carried him to the\r\nTribunal with loud praises and congratulations. With wise moderation\r\nhe demanded no punishment, but, to disarm suspicion of his good\r\nfaith, he criticized one or two of them severely.[279] He was well\r\naware that in civil war the men are allowed more licence than their\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nWhile they were entrenching themselves at Ticinum they heard the        30\r\nnews of Caecina's defeat, and the mutiny nearly broke out afresh:\r\nValens, they thought, had treacherously delayed in order to keep them\r\nout of the battle. They refused rest, would not wait for the general,\r\nmarched on in front of the standards, hurrying on the bearers, and by\r\na forced march joined Caecina. Valens had a bad name with Caecina's\r\narmy. They complained that despite their greatly inferior numbers he\r\nhad exposed them to the full force of the enemy. At the same time, for\r\nfear of being despised as defeated cowards, they excused themselves by\r\nexaggerating the strength of the new arrivals. In fact, though Valens'\r\nnumbers were larger, and he had almost twice as many legionaries and\r\nauxiliaries as Caecina,[280] yet it was Caecina who enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of the men. Apart from his kindness, in which he seemed\r\nmuch readier than Valens, they admired him for his youthful vigour and\r\ncommanding stature,[281] and liked him too without exactly knowing\r\nwhy. So there was rivalry between the generals. Caecina mocked at\r\nValens for his dirty and dishonest ways:[282] Valens at Caecina's\r\npompous vanity. But they smothered their dislike and worked together\r\nfor a common end, writing frequent letters in which they sacrificed\r\nall hope of pardon and heaped abuse on Otho. Otho's generals refrained\r\nfrom retaliating upon Vitellius, though his character offered richer\r\nscope. In death Otho earned a noble name and Vitellius infamy, yet      31\r\nat this time people were more afraid of Otho's burning passions than\r\nof Vitellius' listless luxury. The murder of Galba had made Otho\r\nfeared and hated, while no one attributed to Vitellius the outbreak of\r\nthe war. It was felt that Vitellius' gluttony was a personal disgrace:\r\nOtho's excesses, his cruelty and his daring, spelt more danger to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nNow that Caecina and Valens had joined forces, the Vitellians had no\r\nlonger any reason to avoid a decisive battle. Otho accordingly held a\r\ncouncil to decide whether they should prolong the war or put their\r\nfortune to the test. Suetonius Paulinus, who was considered the         32\r\nmost experienced general of his day,[283] now felt it was due to his\r\nreputation to deliver his views on the general conduct of the war. His\r\ncontention was that the enemy's interests were best served by haste,\r\nOtho's by delay. He argued thus: 'The whole of Vitellius' force has\r\nnow arrived and he has few reinforcements in his rear, for the Gallic\r\nprovinces are in a ferment, and it would be fatal to abandon the Rhine\r\nwith all those hostile tribes ready to swarm across it. The troops in\r\nBritain are busy with their own foes and cut off by the sea: the\r\nSpanish provinces can scarcely spare any troops: the Narbonese are\r\nseriously alarmed by their recent reverse and the inroads of our\r\nfleet. The country across the Po is shut in by the Alps and denied all\r\nsupplies by sea,[284] and, besides, its resources have been already\r\nexhausted by the passage of their army. Nowhere can they get supplies,\r\nand without commissariat no army can be kept together. The German\r\ntroops are their strongest fighting arm, but their constitutions will\r\nnot be strong enough to stand the change of weather, if we protract\r\nthe war into the summer. It has often happened that a force, which\r\nseemed irresistible at first, has dwindled to nothing through the\r\ntedium of forced inaction.\r\n\r\n'On the other hand, our resources are rich and reliable. We have on\r\nour side Pannonia, Moesia, Dalmatia, and the East; the armies there\r\nare fresh and strong; we have Italy and Rome, the Queen of the World,\r\nand the Roman Senate and People: those titles always mean something,\r\nthough their glory may sometimes be obscured. We have large public and\r\nprivate resources, and in civil war a vast quantity of money is\r\nstronger than the sword. Our soldiers are inured to the Italian\r\nclimate or, at any rate, to heat. We are entrenched behind the\r\nPo:[285] its cities are protected by strong walls and willing hands,\r\nand the defence of Placentia has shown that none of them will yield to\r\nthe enemy.' Therefore Otho must remain on the defensive. In a few days\r\nthe Fourteenth legion would arrive: its fame alone was great, and the\r\nMoesian forces[286] would be with it. He should, at any rate, postpone\r\nhis deliberations until then, and fight, if fight he must, with\r\naugmented strength.\r\n\r\nMarius Celsus supported Paulinus. Annius Gallus had been hurt a         33\r\nfew days before by a fall from his horse, but messengers were sent to\r\ninquire his views, and they reported that he too agreed. Otho inclined\r\nto a decisive engagement. His brother Titianus and Proculus, the\r\nprefect of the Guard, with all the impatience of inexperience, stoutly\r\nmaintained that fortune and Providence, and Otho's own good genius\r\ninspired his policy, and would inspire its performance. They had\r\ndescended to flattery by way of checking opposition. When it was\r\ndecided to take the offensive, the question arose whether Otho in\r\nperson should take part in the battle or hold himself in reserve. His\r\nevil counsellors again carried their point. Otho was to retire to\r\nBrixellum,[287] and, by withdrawing from the hazards of the field,\r\nreserve himself for the supreme control of the campaign and of the\r\nempire. To this Paulinus and Celsus offered no further opposition, for\r\nfear of seeming to endanger the person of their prince. From this day\r\ndates the decline of Otho's party. Not only did he take with him a\r\nconsiderable force of the Guards, Body Guard, and cavalry, but the\r\nspirit of the troops who remained behind was broken. The men trusted\r\nno one but Otho, and Otho no one but the men. His generals were under\r\nsuspicion and their authority left in doubt.[288]\r\n\r\nNone of these arrangements failed to reach the ears of the              34\r\nVitellians. Desertions were frequent, as they always are in civil war,\r\nand the scouts in their eagerness to discover the enemy's plans always\r\nfailed to conceal their own. Caecina and Valens, counting on the fatal\r\nimpatience of the enemy, remained quietly on their guard to see what\r\nthey would do: for it is always wisdom to profit by another's folly.\r\nFeigning an intention of crossing the Po, they began to construct a\r\nbridge, partly as a demonstration against the gladiators[289] on the\r\nopposite bank, partly to find something for their idle troops to do.\r\nBoats were placed at equal intervals with their heads up stream and\r\nfastened together by strong wooden planks. They also cast anchors from\r\nthem to ensure the solidity of the bridge, but they allowed the\r\nhawsers to drift slack, so that when the river rose the boats might\r\nall rise with it without the line being broken. To guard the bridge a\r\nhigh tower was built out on the end boat, from which they could\r\nrepulse the enemy with various artillery. Meanwhile the Othonians had\r\nbuilt a tower on the bank and kept up a steady shower of stones and\r\ntorches.\r\n\r\nIn midstream there was an island, to which the gladiators tried to      35\r\nmake their way in boats, but the Germans swam over and got there\r\nfirst. When a good number of them had swam across, Macer manned some\r\nLiburnian cruisers[290] and attacked them with the bravest of his\r\ngladiators. But they fought with less courage than soldiers, and from\r\ntheir unsteady boats they could not shoot so well as the others, who\r\nhad a firm footing on the bank. Swaying this way and that in their\r\nalarm, the sailors and the marines were beginning to get in each\r\nother's way, when the Germans actually leapt into the shallows, caught\r\nhold of the boats by the stern, and either clambered up by the\r\ngangways or sunk them bodily with their own hands. All this took place\r\nbefore the eyes of both armies[291], and the higher rose the spirits\r\nof the Vitellians, the greater became the indignation of the Othonians\r\nagainst Macer, the author and cause of their disaster. The              36\r\nremainder of the boats were eventually dragged off,[292] and the\r\nbattle ended in flight. The army demanded Macer's execution. He had\r\nbeen actually wounded by a lance that had been flung at him, and the\r\nsoldiers were rushing on him with drawn swords when some tribunes and\r\ncenturions intervened and rescued him.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, Vestricius Spurinna, on Otho's orders, brought up a\r\nreinforcement of the Guards, leaving behind a small garrison at\r\nPlacentia, and before long, Otho sent the consul-elect, Flavius\r\nSabinus,[293] to take command of Macer's force. This change pleased\r\nthe soldiers, but the frequent mutinies made the generals unwilling to\r\nassume such a perilous command.\r\n\r\nIn some of my authorities[294] I find a statement that either a         37\r\ngrowing fear of war or dislike of the two emperors, whose\r\ndiscreditable misconduct grew daily more notorious, led the armies to\r\nhesitate whether they should not give up the struggle and either\r\nthemselves combine to choose an emperor or refer the choice to the\r\nsenate. This, it is suggested, was the motive of Otho's generals in\r\nadvising delay, and Paulinus in particular had high hopes, since he\r\nwas the senior ex-consul, and a distinguished general who had earned\r\na brilliant reputation by his operations in Britain. For my own part,\r\nwhile I am ready to admit that a few people may have tacitly wished\r\nfor peace instead of civil war, or for a good and virtuous emperor\r\ninstead of two who were the worst of criminals, yet I imagine that\r\nPaulinus was much too wise to hope that in a time of universal\r\ncorruption the people would show such moderation. Those who had\r\nsacrificed peace in a passion for war were not likely to stop the war\r\nfrom any affection for peace. Nor was it possible that armies whose\r\nlanguage and characteristics differed so widely should ever come to\r\nsuch an agreement. As for the officers; nearly all of them were\r\nextravagant, bankrupt, and guilty of some crime: they had not a good\r\nenough conscience to put up with any emperor who was not as vicious as\r\nthemselves and under an obligation for their services.\r\n\r\nThe old ingrained human passion for power matured and burst into        38\r\nprominence with the growth of the empire. With straiter resources\r\nequality was easily preserved. But when once we had brought the world\r\nto our feet and exterminated every rival state or king, we were left\r\nfree to covet power without fear of interruption. It was then that\r\nstrife first broke out between patricians and plebeians: at one time\r\narose seditious tribunes,[295] at another tyrannous consuls:[296] in\r\nthe Forum at Rome were sown the first seeds of civil war. Before long,\r\nMarius, rising from the lowest ranks of the people, and Sulla, the\r\nmost cruel of all the nobles, crushed our liberty by force of arms and\r\nsubstituted a despotism. Then came Pompey, whose aims, though less\r\npatent, were no better than theirs. From that time onwards the one end\r\nsought was supreme power in the state. Even at Pharsalia and Philippi\r\nthe citizen armies did not lay down their arms. How then can we\r\nsuppose that the troops of Otho and Vitellius would have willingly\r\nstopped the war? The same anger of heaven, the same human passions,\r\nthe same criminal motives drove them into discord. True these wars\r\nwere each settled by a single battle, but that was due to the\r\ngenerals' cowardice. However, my reflections on the ancient and the\r\nmodern character have carried me too far: I must now resume the thread\r\nof our narrative.\r\n\r\nWhen Otho started for Brixellum, he left his brother Titianus in        39\r\nnominal command, though the real power lay with the prefect Proculus.\r\nAs for Celsus and Paulinus, no use was made of their experience, and\r\ntheir empty titles were used as a screen for other people's blunders.\r\nThe tribunes and centurions felt themselves in an ambiguous position,\r\nseeing the better generals sacrificed and the worst in command. The\r\nmen were full of spirit, but preferred criticizing to carrying out\r\ntheir officers' orders. It was decided to advance and encamp four\r\nmiles west of Bedriacum. Though it was spring, and rivers abounded,\r\nthe men were very foolishly allowed to suffer from want of water. Here\r\na council of war was held, for Otho kept sending dispatches urging\r\nhaste, and the soldiers kept clamouring for their emperor to lead\r\nthem. Many demanded that the troops stationed across the Po[297]\r\nshould be brought up. It is not so easy to decide what was the best\r\nthing they could have done as to be sure that what they did do was the\r\nworst. They were in marching order, not fighting trim, and their        40\r\nobjective was the confluence of the Po and the Arda,[298] sixteen\r\nmiles away. Celsus and Paulinus refused to expose their troops,\r\nfatigued by the march and under heavy kit, to the assault of an enemy\r\nwho, while still fresh after covering barely four miles, would\r\ncertainly attack them, either while they were in the disorder of a\r\nmarching column, or when they had broken up to dig trenches. However,\r\nTitianus and Proculus, worsted in argument, appealed to their\r\nauthority: and there arrived post-haste a Numidian orderly with a\r\nperemptory dispatch from Otho, criticizing his generals' inaction, and\r\nordering them to bring matters to a head. He was sick of delay and too\r\nimpatient to live on hope.\r\n\r\nOn that same day, while Caecina was busy with the bridge-building       41\r\noperations,[299] two officers of the Guards came and demanded an\r\ninterview. He was preparing to hear and answer their proposals, when\r\nsome scouts burst in with the news that the enemy were close at hand.\r\nThe officers' conversation was thus interrupted, and it was left\r\nuncertain whether they were broaching a hostile plot or a piece of\r\ntreachery, or some honest plan. Caecina, dismissing the officers, rode\r\nback to the camp, where he found that Valens had given orders to sound\r\nfor battle, and the troops were already under arms. While the legions\r\nwere balloting for the order in which they were to take the field, the\r\ncavalry rode out and charged. Strange to say, they would have been\r\nhurtled back upon the trenches by a smaller force of Othonians, had\r\nnot the Italian legion bravely stopped them by drawing their swords\r\nand forcing them to go back and resume the fight. The Vitellian\r\nlegions formed without any disorder, for though the enemy were close\r\nat hand, thick plantations hid the approaching force. In the Othonian\r\narmy the generals were nervous and the men ill-disposed towards them:\r\ntheir march was hindered by carts and camp-followers, and the high\r\nroad,[300] with its deep ditches on either side, was too narrow even\r\nfor a peaceful march. Some of the men formed round their standards,\r\nothers went searching for their place: on every side there was an\r\nuproar as men ran about shouting to each other: the boldest kept\r\npressing on to the front, while the tide of the timid ebbed to the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nAmid the confusion of this sudden panic somebody invented a story       42\r\nthat Vitellius' army had abandoned his cause, whereupon an\r\nunwarrantable glee relaxed their efforts. It was never fully known\r\nwhether this report was spread by Vitellian scouts or whether it was\r\nstarted on Otho's side, either by treachery or chance. Losing all\r\ntheir thirst for battle the Othonians actually broke into a cheer. The\r\nenemy answered with angry shouts, and most of Otho's soldiers, having\r\nno idea what caused the cheering, feared treachery. At this point the\r\nVitellian line charged. They were fresh, and in good order, stronger\r\nand more numerous. However, the Othonians, despite their disorder,\r\nfewer numbers, and fatigue, offered a stubborn resistance. The ground\r\nwas encumbered with orchards and vineyards, and the character of the\r\nbattle varied accordingly. They fought now from a distance, now at\r\nclose quarters, and charged sometimes in detachment, sometimes in\r\ncolumn.[301] On the raised high-road they fought hand to hand, using\r\nthe weight of their bodies and their shields. They gave up throwing\r\ntheir javelins and cut through helmet and breastplate with sword and\r\naxe. Each man knew his foe; they were in view of the other\r\ntroops;[302] and they fought as if the whole issue of the war depended\r\non them.\r\n\r\nIt happened that two legions met in the open fields between the         43\r\nhigh road and the Po. These were: for Vitellius the Twenty-first,\r\ncommonly called Rapax,[303] a regiment of old renown; and for Otho the\r\nFirst Adiutrix,[304] which had never been in battle before, but was\r\nfull of spirit and eager to win its first laurels. Their charge\r\noverthrew the front ranks of the Twenty-first, and they carried off\r\nits eagle. Fired with indignation, the Twenty-first rallied and\r\ncharged the front of the enemy, killing the commanding officer,\r\nOrfidius Benignus, and capturing many of their colours.\r\n\r\nOn the other flank the Fifth[305] drove the Thirteenth[306] off the\r\nfield. The Fourteenth[307] were surrounded by the numbers that\r\nattacked them. Otho's generals had long ago fled. Caecina and Valens\r\nbegan to bring up the reserves to the support of their men, and, as a\r\nfresh reinforcement, there arrived Varus Alfenus[308] with his\r\nBatavians. They had routed the gladiators[309] by confronting them and\r\ncutting them to pieces in the river before their transports could\r\nland, and flushed by their victory came charging in upon the flank of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nTheir centre broken, the Othonians fled in disorder, making for         44\r\nBedriacum. The distance was immense;[310] the road encumbered with\r\nheaps of dead. This made the slaughter all the greater, for in civil\r\nwar captives cannot be turned to profit.[311] Suetonius Paulinus and\r\nLicinius Proculus avoided the camp at Bedriacum by diverse routes.\r\nVedius Aquila, who commanded the Thirteenth legion, was so paralysed\r\nby fear that he allowed himself to fall into the hands of the\r\nindignant troops. It was still broad daylight when he entered the\r\ncamp. Immediately a crowd of mutinous fugitives came clamouring round\r\nhim. They spared neither abuse nor violence, assailing him as a\r\ndeserter and a traitor. They could bring no special charge against\r\nhim, but the mob always lay their own disgrace on some one else. Night\r\ncame to the aid of Titianus and Celsus, for Annius Gallus[312] had\r\nalready placed sentinels on guard and got the men under control. Using\r\nremonstrances, prayers, and commands, he had induced them not to add\r\nto the disaster of their defeat by murdering their own friends.\r\nWhether the war was over, or whether they wanted to fight again, in\r\ndefeat, he told them, union was the one thing that could help them.\r\nAll the other troops[313] were crushed by the blow. The Guards\r\ncomplained that they had been beaten, not by the enemy's valour, but\r\nby sheer treachery. 'Why,' they said, 'even the Vitellians have won no\r\nbloodless victory. We beat their cavalry and captured a standard from\r\none of their legions. We still have Otho left and all the troops with\r\nhim on the other side of the Po. The Moesian legions[314] are on their\r\nway. There is a large force left at Bedriacum. These, at any rate,\r\nhave not been defeated yet. Better fall, if need be, on the field.'\r\nNow exasperated, now depressed by these reflections, they were in a\r\nstate of blank despair, which more often aroused their anger than\r\ntheir fear.\r\n\r\nThe Vitellian army halted at the fifth mile-stone on the road from      45\r\nBedriacum. Their generals would not venture to storm the camp that\r\nsame day, and hoped the enemy would consent to surrender. However,\r\nalthough they were in fighting trim, and had no implements for digging\r\ntrenches, they felt safe with their arms and the pride of victory. On\r\nthe next day there was no doubt about the wishes of the Othonians.\r\nEven those who showed most spirit had now changed their minds. So they\r\nsent a deputation. The Vitellian generals had no hesitation in\r\ngranting terms. However, they detained the deputation for a short\r\ntime, which caused some qualms to those who did not know whether it\r\nhad been successful. At length the envoys returned, and the gates of\r\nthe camp were opened. Then both victors and vanquished burst into\r\ntears, and with a sort of sorrowful satisfaction cursed their fate of\r\ncivil war. There in one tent were men of both armies, nursing a\r\nwounded brother or some other relative. Their hopes of recompense were\r\ndoubtful: all that was certain was bereavement and grief, for no one\r\nwas so fortunate as to mourn no loss. They searched for the body of\r\nthe fallen officer, Orfidius, and burnt it with due solemnity. Of the\r\nother dead, some were buried by their relatives, the rest were left\r\nlying on the ground.\r\n\r\nOtho[315] was awaiting news of the battle with perfect confidence       46\r\nand firm resolve. First came a disquieting rumour. Soon fugitives from\r\nthe field revealed the ruin of his cause. But the soldiers in their\r\nzeal did not wait to hear their emperor speak. 'Keep a good heart,'\r\nthey said, 'you still have fresh forces left, and, as for us, we are\r\nready to risk everything and suffer everything.' Nor was this\r\nflattery. In a wild passion of enthusiasm they urged him to march to\r\nthe field and restore the fortunes of his party. Those who were near\r\nhim clasped his knees, while those who stood further off stretched out\r\ntheir arms to him.[316] The most eager of all was Plotius Firmus, the\r\nPrefect of the Guard, who besought Otho again and again not to desert\r\na supremely faithful army, men who had done him such great service. He\r\ntold him that it showed more courage to bear misfortune than to give\r\nin: that men of vigour and courage cling to their hopes even in the\r\nface of disaster: it is only cowards who let their terror hurry them\r\ninto despair. Amid all these appeals the soldiers now cheered, now\r\ngroaned, according as Otho's expression showed signs of yielding or\r\nseemed to harden. Nor were these feelings confined to Otho's own\r\nGuards. The first arrivals from Moesia assured him that the spirit of\r\nthe advancing force was just as firm, and that they had already\r\nentered Aquileia.[317] There is no room for doubt that it was still\r\npossible to revive this cruel and pitiable war, so full of uncertainty\r\nto both parties.[318]\r\n\r\nOtho himself disliked the policy of fighting. 'Am I,' he said, 'to      47\r\nexpose all your splendid courage and devotion to further risks? That\r\nwould be too great a price to pay for my life. Your high hopes of\r\nsucceeding, if I were minded to live, will only swell the glory of my\r\ndeath. We have learnt to know each other, Fortune and I. Do not reckon\r\nthe length of my reign. Self-control is all the harder when a man\r\nknows that his fortune cannot last. It was Vitellius who began the\r\ncivil war. He originated the policy of fighting for the throne. But\r\none battle is enough. This is the precedent that I will set. Let\r\nposterity judge me by it. I do not grudge Vitellius his brother, or\r\nwife, or children. I want neither revenge nor consolation. Others may\r\nhave held the sceptre longer, but no one can ever have laid it down so\r\nbravely. Am I the man to allow the flower of Rome in all these famous\r\narmies to be mown down once again and lost to the country? Let me take\r\nwith me the consciousness that you would have died for me. But you\r\nmust stay and live. No more delay. I must no longer interfere with\r\nyour chance of pardon, nor you with my resolve. It is a sort of\r\ncowardice to go on talking about the end. Here is your best proof of\r\nmy determination: I complain of no one. To blame gods or men is his\r\nalone who fain would keep his life.'\r\n\r\nAfter some such speech as this he urged them courteously to hurry       48\r\naway and not to exasperate the victor by their hesitation. To each\r\nman's age and position he paid due regard, using his authority with\r\nthe young and persuasion with his elders, while his quiet looks and\r\nfirm speech helped to control their ill-timed tears. He gave orders\r\nfor boats and carriages to be provided for their departure. All\r\npetitions and letters containing any compliments to himself, or marked\r\ninsults to Vitellius, he destroyed, and distributed his money\r\ncarefully, not like a man at the point of death. He then actually\r\ntried to comfort the sorrowful fears of his nephew, Salvius\r\nCocceianus,[319] by praising his attachment and chiding his alarm. 'Do\r\nyou imagine,' he said, 'that Vitellius will be so hard-hearted as not\r\nto show me some gratitude for saving his whole household? By promptly\r\nputting an end to myself, I deserve to earn some mercy for my family.\r\nFor it is not in blank despair, but with my army clamouring for\r\nbattle, that I determine to save my country from the last calamities.\r\nI have won enough fame for myself and ennoblement for my posterity;\r\nfor, after the line of the Julians, Claudians, Servians,[320] I have\r\nbeen the first to bring the principate into a new family. So rouse\r\nyourself and go on with your life. Never forget that Otho was your\r\nuncle, yet keep your remembrance within bounds.'\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this he made them all retire and rested for a while. But his      49\r\nlast reflections were interrupted by a sudden disturbance and the news\r\nof a mutinous outbreak among the troops. They were threatening to kill\r\nall those who were leaving, and turned with especial violence against\r\nVerginius,[321] whose house was in a state of siege. Otho rebuked the\r\nringleaders and returned, consenting to receive the adieux of those\r\nwho were going, until it was time for them to depart in safety. As the\r\nday deepened into evening he quenched his thirst with a drink of iced\r\nwater. Two daggers were brought to him and, after trying them both, he\r\nput one under his pillow. Being assured on inquiry that his friends\r\nhad started, he spent a peaceful night, not, it is said, without\r\nsleep. At break of day[322] he fell upon his dagger. Hearing his dying\r\ngroan, his slaves and freedmen entered with Plotius Firmus, the\r\nPrefect of the Guards, and found a single wound in his breast. The\r\nfuneral was hurried forward out of respect for his own earnest\r\nentreaties, for he had been afraid his head might be cut off and\r\nsubjected to outrage. The Guard carried the body, sounding his praises\r\nwith tears in their eyes, and covering his hands and wounded breast\r\nwith kisses. Some of the soldiers killed themselves beside the pyre,\r\nnot because they had harmed Vitellius or feared reprisals, but from\r\nlove of their emperor, and to follow his noble example. Similar\r\nsuicides became common afterwards at Bedriacum and Placentia, and in\r\nother encampments.[323] An inconspicuous tomb was built for Otho, as\r\nbeing less likely to be disturbed: and thus he ended his life in his\r\nthirty-seventh year.\r\n\r\nOtho came originally from the borough of Ferentium.[324] His            50\r\nfather had been consul and his grandfather praetor. His mother's\r\nfamily was inferior, but not without distinction.[325] His boyhood and\r\nyouth were such as we have seen. By his two great acts,[326] one most\r\ncriminal and the other heroic, he earned in equal measure the praise\r\nand the reprobation of posterity. It would certainly be beneath the\r\ndignity of my task to collect fabulous rumours for the amusement of my\r\nreaders, but there are certain popular traditions which I cannot\r\nventure to contradict. On the day of the battle of Bedriacum,\r\naccording to the account of the local peasants, a strange bird\r\nappeared in a much-frequented grove near Regium Lepidum.[327] There it\r\nsat, unterrified and unmoved, either by the crowds of people or by the\r\nbirds which fluttered round it, until the moment at which Otho killed\r\nhimself. Then it vanished. A calculation of the time showed that the\r\nprodigy's appearance and disappearance coincided with the beginning of\r\nthe battle[328] and Otho's death.\r\n\r\nAt his funeral the rage and grief of the soldiers broke out into        51\r\nanother mutiny. This time there was no one to control them. They\r\nturned to Verginius and begged him with threats now to accept the\r\nprincipate, now to head a deputation to Caecina and Valens. However,\r\nVerginius escaped them, slipping out by the back door of his house\r\njust as they broke in at the front. Rubrius Gallus carried a petition\r\nfrom the Guards at Brixellum, and obtained immediate pardon.\r\nSimultaneously Flavius Sabinus surrendered to the victor the troops\r\nunder his command.[329]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [273] Pavia.\r\n\r\n    [274] i. 66.\r\n\r\n    [275] i. 59 and 64.\r\n\r\n    [276] See chap. 14.\r\n\r\n    [277] It is Tacitus who has mixed the metaphors.\r\n\r\n    [278] See i. 66.\r\n\r\n    [279] i.e. he pretended that not all but only a few were to\r\n          blame (cp. i. 84).\r\n\r\n    [280] Valens had by now Legion V, I Italica, detachments from\r\n          I, XV, XVI, and Taurus' Horse: Caecina had Legion XXI and\r\n          detachments from IV and VII.\r\n\r\n    [281] Cp. i. 53.\r\n\r\n    [282] Cp. i. 66.\r\n\r\n    [283] He had made his name in a Moorish war (A.D. 42), when he\r\n          had penetrated as far as Mount Atlas, and increased his\r\n          reputation by suppressing the rebellion of Boadicea when he\r\n          was governor of Britain (A.D. 59).\r\n\r\n    [284] Otho held the fleets.\r\n\r\n    [285] He means that they would be, if they took his advice and\r\n          retired across the Po to the south bank.\r\n\r\n    [286] According to the rumours quoted in chap. 46 they were\r\n          already at Aquileia, near Venice, but Suetonius, whose father\r\n          was at this time a tribune in the Thirteenth, says that they\r\n          heard of Otho's death before arriving at Aquileia.\r\n\r\n    [287] Brescello.\r\n\r\n    [288] No one knew for certain who was in command.

The main armies were Otho's at Bedriacum and\r\n          Vitellius' at Cremona.\r\n\r\n    [292] i.e. from the Germans who were trying to board or sink them.\r\n\r\n    [293] See i. 77.\r\n\r\n    [294] Plutarch, in his Life of Otho, after quoting the view of\r\n          the emperor's secretary, Secundus, that Otho was over-strained\r\n          and desperate, goes on to give the explanation of 'others'.\r\n          This agrees exactly with the story given here. Plutarch and\r\n          Tacitus are apparently quoting from the same authority,\r\n          unknown to us, perhaps Cluvius Rufus.\r\n\r\n    [295] e.g. the brothers Gracchus, Saturninus, and Drusus.\r\n\r\n    [296] e.g. Appius Claudius and L. Opimius, of whom Plutarch\r\n          says that in suppressing C. Gracchus he used his consular\r\n          authority like that of a dictator.\r\n\r\n    [297] At Brixellum.\r\n\r\n    [298] About seven miles below Cremona. The Medicean MS. has\r\n          Adua, but as the mouth of the Adua is seven miles west of\r\n          Cremona and Bedriacum twenty-two miles east of Cremona, the\r\n          figures given do not suit. For Tacitus says that they marched\r\n          first four miles and then sixteen. Mr. Henderson proposes to\r\n          solve the difficulty by reading _quartum decimum_ for\r\n          _quartum_ in chap. 39. But his reasons are purely _a priori_.\r\n          If the confluence was that of the _Arda_ with the Po, Tacitus'\r\n          _quartum_ is still unsatisfactory, but the distances given in\r\n          Plutarch's Life of Otho would suit the facts. He makes the\r\n          first march a little over six miles. From the camp then\r\n          pitched to the mouth of the Arda would be by road about\r\n          sixteen miles. Thus Tacitus' first figure may be a slight\r\n          underestimate and his second figure correct. The second day's\r\n          march, according to Plutarch, was rather more than twelve\r\n          miles, so we may suppose that the armies met about four miles\r\n          short of the confluence, which was the Othonians' objective.\r\n          This suits Paulinus' suggestion a few lines lower that the\r\n          Vitellians need only march four miles to catch them in\r\n          marching column. The whole question is fully discussed by Mr.\r\n          Henderson (op. cit.) and by Mr. E.G. Hardy in the _Journal of\r\n          Philology_, vol. xxxi, no. 61.\r\n\r\n    [299] See 34 and 35.\r\n\r\n    [300] Via Postumia.\r\n\r\n    [301] The word here used, _cuneus_ (a wedge), should mean\r\n          strictly a V-shaped formation, which the troops also called\r\n          'pig's-head'. But it is also used more generally of any\r\n          attacking column advancing to pierce the enemy's line, or\r\n          indeed of any body of men in close order.\r\n\r\n    [302] Because they were on the raised Postumian road.\r\n\r\n    [303] i.e. The Irresistibles.\r\n\r\n    [304] The quondam marines (cp. i. 6, &c.).\r\n\r\n    [305] From Lower Germany (cp. i. 55 and 61).\r\n\r\n    [306] From Pannonia (cp. chap. 24).\r\n\r\n    [307] Only a detachment of the Fourteenth was present at this\r\n          battle, as is explained below, chap. 66.\r\n\r\n    [308] The camp-prefect (chap. 29).

Tacitus would doubtless have condemned Plutarch's story\r\n          for its lack of tragic pathos. The facts, however, are against\r\n          Tacitus. Now that his main force had capitulated at Bedriacum,\r\n          Otho had no sufficient army to fight with, since the\r\n          Vitellians lay between him and his Danube army at Aquileia.\r\n\r\n    [319] Titianus' son.

When the news of the defeat\r\nreached Mutina, the soldiers paid no heed to what they took for a\r\nbaseless rumour, and, believing the senators to be hostile to Otho,\r\nthey treasured up their conversation and put the worst interpretation\r\non their looks and behaviour. In time they broke into abusive\r\nreproaches, seeking a pretext for starting a general massacre, while\r\nthe senators suffered at the same time from another source of alarm,\r\nfor they were afraid of seeming to be slow in welcoming the victory of\r\nthe now predominant Vitellian party. Terrified at their double danger,\r\nthey held a meeting. For no one dared to form any policy for himself;\r\neach felt safer in sharing his guilt with others. The town-council of\r\nMutina, too, kept adding to their anxiety by offering them arms and\r\nmoney, styling them with ill-timed respect 'Conscript Fathers'. A       53\r\nremarkable quarrel arose at this meeting. Licinius Caecina attacked\r\nEprius Marcellus[331] for the ambiguity of his language. Not that the\r\nothers disclosed their sentiments, but Caecina, who was still a\r\nnobody, recently raised to the senate, sought to distinguish himself\r\nby quarrelling with some one of importance, and selected Marcellus,\r\nbecause the memory of his career as an informer made him an object of\r\nloathing. They were parted by the prudent intervention of their\r\nbetters, and all then retired to Bononia,[332] intending to continue\r\nthe discussion there, and hoping for more news in the meantime. At\r\nBononia they dispatched men along the roads in every direction to\r\nquestion all new-comers. From one of Otho's freedmen they inquired why\r\nhe had come away, and were told he was carrying his master's last\r\ninstructions: the man said that when he had left, Otho was still\r\nindeed alive, but had renounced the pleasures of life and was devoting\r\nall his thoughts to posterity. This filled them with admiration. They\r\nfelt ashamed to ask any more questions--and declared unanimously for\r\nVitellius.\r\n\r\nVitellius' brother Lucius was present at their discussion, and now      54\r\ndisplayed his willingness to receive their flattery, but one of Nero's\r\nfreedmen, called Coenus, suddenly startled them all by inventing the\r\natrocious falsehood that the Fourteenth legion had joined forces with\r\nthe troops at Brixellum, and that their sudden arrival had turned the\r\nfortune of the day: the victorious army had been cut to pieces. He\r\nhoped by inventing this good news to regain some authority for Otho's\r\npassports,[333] which were beginning to be disregarded. He did,\r\nindeed, thus insure for himself a quick journey to Rome, but was\r\nexecuted by order of Vitellius a few days later. However, the senate's\r\ndanger was augmented because the soldiers believed the news. Their\r\nfears were the more acute, because it looked as if their departure\r\nfrom Mutina was an official move of the Council of State, which thus\r\nseemed to have deserted the party. So they refrained from holding any\r\nmore meetings, and each shifted for himself, until a letter arrived\r\nfrom Fabius Valens which quieted their fears. Besides, the news of\r\nOtho's death travelled all the more quickly because it excited\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nAt Rome, however, there was no sign of panic. The festival of           55\r\nCeres[334] was celebrated by the usual crowds. When it was reported in\r\nthe theatre on reliable authority that Otho had renounced his\r\nclaim,[335] and that Flavius Sabinus,[336] the City Prefect, had made\r\nall the troops in Rome swear allegiance to Vitellius, the audience\r\ncheered Vitellius. The populace decked all the busts of Galba with\r\nlaurel-leaves and flowers, and carried them round from temple to\r\ntemple. The garlands were eventually piled up into a sort of tomb near\r\nLake Curtius,[337] on the spot which Galba had stained with his\r\nlife-blood. In the senate the distinctions devised during the long\r\nreigns of other emperors were all conferred on Vitellius at once.[338]\r\nTo these was added a vote of thanks and congratulation to the German\r\narmy, and a deputation was dispatched to express the senate's\r\nsatisfaction. Letters were read which Fabius Valens had addressed to\r\nthe consuls in very moderate terms. But Caecina's moderation was still\r\nmore gratifying: he had not written at all.[339]\r\n\r\nHowever, Italy found peace a more ghastly burden than the war.          56\r\nVitellius' soldiers scattered through all the boroughs and colonial\r\ntowns, indulging in plunder, violence, and rape. Impelled by their\r\ngreed or the promise of payment, they cared nothing for right and\r\nwrong: kept their hands off nothing sacred or profane. Even civilians\r\nput on uniform and seized the opportunity to murder their enemies. The\r\nsoldiers themselves, knowing the countryside well, marked down the\r\nrichest fields and wealthiest houses for plunder, determined to murder\r\nany one who offered resistance. Their generals were too much in their\r\ndebt to venture any opposition. Of the two Caecina showed less greed\r\nand more ambition. Valens had earned a bad name by his own ill-gotten\r\ngains, and was therefore bound to shut his eyes to others'\r\nshortcomings.[340] The resources of Italy had long been exhausted; all\r\nthese thousands of infantry and cavalry, all this violence and damage\r\nand outrage was almost more than the country could bear.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Vitellius knew nothing of his victory. With the               57\r\nremainder of his German army he continued to advance as though the war\r\nhad just begun. A few of the veterans were left in winter quarters,\r\nand troops were hurriedly enlisted in the Gallic provinces, to fill up\r\nthe vacancies in what were now mere skeleton legions.[341] Leaving\r\nHordeonius Flaccus to guard the line of the Rhine, Vitellius advanced\r\nwith a picked detachment from the army in Britain, eight thousand\r\nstrong. After a few days' march he received news of the victory of\r\nBedriacum and the collapse of the war on the death of Otho. He\r\nsummoned a meeting and heaped praise on the courage of the troops.\r\nWhen the army demanded that he should confer equestrian rank on his\r\nfreedman Asiaticus, he checked their shameful flattery. Then with\r\ncharacteristic instability he granted at a private banquet what he had\r\nrefused in public. This Asiaticus, who was thus decorated with the\r\ngold ring, was an infamous menial who rose by his vices.[342]\r\n\r\nDuring these same days news arrived that Albinus, the Governor of       58\r\nMauretania, had been murdered, and both provinces[343] had declared\r\nfor Vitellius. Appointed by Nero to the province of Mauretania\r\nCaesariensis, Lucceius Albinus had further received from Galba the\r\ngovernorship of Tingitana, and thus commanded a very considerable\r\nforce, consisting of nineteen cohorts of infantry, five regiments of\r\nhorse, and an immense horde of Moors, well trained for war by their\r\npractice in plunder. After Galba's murder he inclined to Otho's side\r\nand, not contented with the province of Africa, began to threaten\r\nSpain on the other side of the narrow strait. Cluvius Rufus,[344]\r\nalarmed at this, moved the Tenth legion[345] down to the coast as\r\nthough for transport. He also sent some centurions ahead to gain the\r\nsympathies of the Moors for Vitellius. The great reputation of the\r\nGerman army throughout the provinces facilitated this task, and they\r\nalso spread a rumour that Albinus was not contented with the title of\r\n'Governor', and wanted to adopt a regal style under the name of Juba.\r\nSo the sympathies of the army shifted. Asinius Pollio, who              59\r\ncommanded the local cavalry, one of Albinus' loyal friends, was\r\nassassinated. The same fate befell Festus and Scipio, who were in\r\ncommand of the infantry.[346] Albinus himself embarked from Tingitana\r\nfor Caesariensis, and was murdered as he landed. His wife confronted\r\nthe assassins and was murdered too. How all this happened Vitellius\r\nnever inquired. He passed by events of the highest importance after a\r\nfew moments' attention, being quite unable to cope with serious\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Arar,[347] Vitellius ordered his army to march\r\noverland while he sailed down the river. Travelling with no imperial\r\nstate, he had nothing but his original poverty[348] to make him\r\nconspicuous, until Junius Blaesus, Governor of the Lyons division of\r\nGaul, a member of an eminent family, whose liberality matched his\r\nwealth, provided the emperor with a staff and escorted him in person\r\nwith great courtesy, an attention which proved most unwelcome to\r\nVitellius, although he concealed his annoyance under the grossest\r\nflattery. At Lugdunum he found the generals of both parties awaiting\r\nhim. Valens and Caecina were openly commended at a public meeting, and\r\ngiven places on either side of the emperor's throne. He then sent the\r\nwhole army to fetch his infant son,[349] and when they brought him\r\nwearing a general's uniform, Vitellius took him up in his arms and\r\nnamed him Germanicus,[350] at the same time decorating him with all\r\nthe insignia of his imperial position. The exaggerated honours of\r\nthese days proved the child's only consolation for the evil times\r\nwhich followed.[351]\r\n\r\nThe most energetic of Otho's centurions were now executed, which        60\r\ndid more than anything else to alienate the armies of Illyricum. The\r\nother legions also caught the infection, and their dislike of the\r\nGerman troops made them harbour thoughts of war. Suetonius Paulinus\r\nand Licinius Proculus were kept in mourning[352] and suspense,\r\ndisheartened by delay. When at last their case was heard, their pleas\r\nsavoured more of necessity than honour. They positively claimed credit\r\nfor treachery, alleging that the long march before the battle, the\r\nfatigue of their troops, and the confusion created by the wagons in\r\ntheir lines were all due not to chance, but to their own treachery.\r\nVitellius believed their protestations of treason, and acquitted them\r\nof all suspicion of loyalty.\r\n\r\nOtho's brother, Salvius Titianus, was in no danger. His affection for\r\nhis brother and his personal inefficiency excused him. Marius Celsus\r\nwas allowed to hold his consulship.[353] But rumour gave rise to a\r\nbelief which led to an attack being made in the senate against\r\nCaecilius Simplex, who was charged with trying to purchase the\r\nconsulship and to secure Celsus' destruction. Vitellius, however,\r\nrefused this, and afterwards allowed Simplex to hold the consulship\r\nwithout detriment to his conscience or his purse. Trachalus was\r\nprotected against his accusers by Galeria, Vitellius' wife.[354]\r\n\r\nWith so many of the great in danger of their lives, an obscure          61\r\ncreature called Mariccus, of the tribe of the Boii[355]--it is a\r\nsordid incident[356]--endeavoured to thrust himself into greatness and\r\nto challenge the armies of Rome, pretending to be a minister of\r\nHeaven. This divine champion of the Gauls, as he had entitled himself,\r\nhad already gathered a force of eight thousand men, and began making\r\novertures[357] to the neighbouring Aeduan villages. But the chief\r\ncommunity of the Aedui wisely sent out a picked force, with some\r\nVitellian troops in support, and scattered the mob of fanatics.\r\nMariccus was captured in the engagement, and later thrown to wild\r\nbeasts.[358] As they refused to devour him, the common people stupidly\r\nbelieved him invulnerable, until he was executed in the presence of\r\nVitellius.\r\n\r\nNo further measures were taken against the life or property of the      62\r\nrebels.[359] The estates of those who had fallen fighting for Otho\r\nwere allowed to devolve by will or else by the law of intestate\r\nsuccession. Indeed, if Vitellius had set limits to his luxury, there\r\nwas no need to fear his greed for money. It was his foul and\r\ninsatiable gluttony. Rome and Italy were scoured for dainties to\r\ntickle his palate: from shore to shore the high roads rang with the\r\ntraffic. The leading provincials were ruined by having to provide for\r\nhis table. The very towns were impoverished. Meanwhile the soldiers\r\nwere acquiring luxurious habits, learning to despise their general,\r\nand gradually losing their former efficiency and courage.\r\n\r\nVitellius sent a manifesto on to Rome in which he declined the title\r\nof Caesar, and postponed calling himself Augustus without giving up\r\nany portion of his power. All astrologers[360] were exiled from\r\nItaly, and rigorous provision was made to restrain Roman knights from\r\nthe disgrace of appearing at the games in the arena.[361] Former\r\nemperors had paid, or more often compelled them to do this, and many\r\nof the provincial towns vied together in hiring the most profligate\r\nyoung aristocrats.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of his brother and the growing influence of his tutors      63\r\nin tyranny made Vitellius daily more haughty and cruel. He gave orders\r\nfor the execution of Dolabella, whom Otho, as we have seen,[362] had\r\nrelegated to the colonial town of Aquinum. On hearing of Otho's death,\r\nhe had ventured back to Rome. Whereupon an ex-praetor, named Plancius\r\nVarus, one of Dolabella's closest friends, laid information before the\r\ncity prefect, Flavius Sabinus, maintaining that he had broken from\r\ncustody to put himself at the head of the defeated party. He added\r\nthat Dolabella had tried to tamper with the cohort stationed at\r\nOstia.[363] Having no proof of these very serious charges, he repented\r\nand begged for his friend's forgiveness. But it was too late. The\r\ncrime was committed. While Flavius Sabinus was hesitating what to do\r\nin such a serious matter, Lucius Vitellius' wife, Triaria, whose\r\ncruelty was altogether unwomanly, terrified him by suggesting that he\r\nwas trying to get a reputation for mercy at the expense of his\r\nemperor's safety. Sabinus was naturally of a kindly disposition, but\r\neasily changed under the influence of fear. Though it was not he who\r\nwas in danger, he was full of alarms, and hastened Dolabella's\r\nimpending ruin for fear of being supposed to have helped him.\r\nVitellius, accordingly, from motives both of suspicion and of           64\r\nhatred (Dolabella had married his divorced wife Petronia), summoned\r\nDolabella by letter to avoid the crowded thoroughfare of the Flaminian\r\nroad and to turn off to Interamnium,[364] where he gave orders for his\r\nmurder. The assassin found the journey tedious; discovered his victim\r\nsleeping on the floor at a wayside inn, and cut his throat. This gave\r\nthe new government a very bad name. People took it as a specimen of\r\nwhat to expect. Triaria's shameless behaviour was further emphasized\r\nby the exemplary behaviour of her relative Galeria, the emperor's\r\nwife, who kept clear of these dreadful doings. Equally admirable was\r\nthe character of his mother, Sextilia, a woman of the old school. It\r\nwas even on record that when her son's first letters were read to her,\r\nshe said, 'It was no Germanicus,[365] but a Vitellius that I brought\r\ninto the world.' From that time neither the attractions of her high\r\nstation nor the unanimous flattery of Rome could win her over to\r\ncomplacence. She only shared the sorrows of her house.\r\n\r\nWhen Vitellius left Lugdunum, Cluvius Rufus[366] relinquished his       65\r\nSpanish province and followed him. He knew that serious charges had\r\nbeen made against him, and his smiling congratulations hid an anxious\r\nheart. A freedman of the imperial court,[367] Hilarus by name, had\r\ngiven evidence against him, alleging that, when Cluvius heard of the\r\nrival claims of Otho and Vitellius, he had endeavoured to set up an\r\nindependent authority of his own in Spain, and to this end had issued\r\npassports with no emperor's name at the head.[368] Certain phrases in\r\nhis speeches were also construed as damaging to Vitellius and as a bid\r\nfor his own popularity. However, Cluvius' influence carried the day,\r\nand Vitellius even had his own freedman punished. Cluvius was given a\r\nplace at court, while still retaining Spain, of which he was absentee\r\ngovernor, following the precedent of Lucius Arruntius. In his case,\r\nhowever, Tiberius' motive had been suspicion, whereas Vitellius\r\ndetained Cluvius without any such qualms.[369] Trebellius Maximus[370]\r\nwas not allowed the same privilege. He had fled from Britain to escape\r\nthe fury of his troops. Vettius Bolanus, who was then about the court,\r\nwas sent out to take his place.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of the defeated legions still gave Vitellius a good        66\r\ndeal of anxiety. Their spirit was by no means broken. They distributed\r\nthemselves all over Italy, mingling with the victors and talking\r\ntreason. The most uncompromising of all were the Fourteenth, who\r\nrefused to acknowledge their defeat. At Bedriacum, they argued, it was\r\nonly a detachment that had been beaten, the main strength of the\r\nlegion was not present.[371] It was decided to send them back to\r\nBritain, whence Nero had summoned them, and meanwhile they were to\r\nshare their quarters with the Batavian irregulars, because of the\r\nlong-standing feud between them.[372] Quartered as they were under\r\narms, their mutual hatred soon broke out into disorder.\r\n\r\nAt Turin[373] one of the Batavians was cursing a workman for having\r\ncheated him, when a legionary, who lodged with the workman, took his\r\npart. Each quickly gathered his fellow soldiers round him, and from\r\nabuse they came to bloodshed. Indeed, a fierce battle would have\r\nbroken out, unless two regiments of Guards had sided with the\r\nFourteenth, thus giving them confidence and frightening the Batavians.\r\nVitellius gave orders that the Batavians should be drafted into his\r\narmy, while the legion was to be marched over the Graian Alps[374] by\r\na détour which would avoid Vienne.[375] Its inhabitants were another\r\ncause for alarm.[376] On the night on which the legion started they\r\nleft fires burning all over Turin, and part of the town was burnt\r\ndown. This disaster, like so many others in the civil war, has been\r\nobliterated by the greater calamities which befell other cities. No\r\nsooner were the Fourteenth across the Alps than the most mutinous\r\nspirits started off to march for Vienne, but they were stopped by the\r\nunanimous interference of the better men, and the legion was shipped\r\nacross to Britain.\r\n\r\nVitellius' next cause of anxiety was the Guards. At first they          67\r\nwere quartered apart, and then, appeased by an honourable\r\ndischarge,[377] they gave up their arms to their officers. But when\r\nthe news went round of the war with Vespasian, they enlisted again and\r\nformed the main strength of the Flavian party.\r\n\r\nThe First legion of marines was sent to Spain to cultivate docility in\r\npeace and quiet. The Eleventh and the Seventh were sent back to their\r\nwinter quarters.[378] The Thirteenth were set to work to build\r\namphitheatres. For Caecina at Cremona and Valens at Bononia were each\r\npreparing to give a gladiatorial show. Vitellius never let his\r\nanxieties interfere with his pleasures.\r\n\r\nThe losing party being thus dispersed by peaceful means, disorder       68\r\nbroke out in the victorious camp. It originated in sport, but the\r\nnumber of deaths increased the feeling against Vitellius. He had\r\ninvited Verginius to dine with him at Ticinum, and they had just sat\r\ndown to table. The conduct of officers is always determined by the\r\nbehaviour of their generals; it depends on that whether they adopt the\r\nsimple life or indulge their taste for riotous living;[379] this again\r\ndetermines whether the troops are smart or disorderly. In Vitellius'\r\narmy disorder and drunkenness were universal: it was more like a\r\nmidnight orgy[380] than a properly disciplined camp. So it happened\r\nthat two of the soldiers, one belonging to the Fifth legion, the other\r\nto the Gallic auxiliaries, in a drunken frolic challenged each other\r\nto wrestle. The legionary fell; and when the Gaul began to exult over\r\nhim, the soldiers who had gathered round took sides, and the\r\nlegionaries, breaking out against the auxiliaries with murderous\r\nintent, actually cut to pieces a couple of cohorts. This commotion was\r\nonly cured by another. A cloud of dust and the glitter of arms\r\nappeared on the horizon. Suddenly a cry arose that the Fourteenth had\r\nturned back and were marching on them. However, it was their own\r\nrear-guard bringing up the stragglers. This discovery quieted their\r\nalarm. Meanwhile, coming across one of Verginius' slaves, they\r\ncharged him with intending to assassinate Vitellius, and rushed off\r\nto the banquet clamouring for Verginius' head. No one really doubted\r\nhis innocence, not even Vitellius, who always quailed at a breath of\r\nsuspicion. Yet, though it was the death of an ex-consul, their own\r\nformer general, which they demanded, it was with difficulty that they\r\nwere quieted. No one was a target for these outbreaks so often as\r\nVerginius. He still retained the admiration and esteem of the men, but\r\nthey hated him for disdaining their offer.[381]\r\n\r\nOn the next day Vitellius granted an audience to the deputation of      69\r\nthe senate, which he had told to await him at Ticinum. He then entered\r\nthe camp and spontaneously complimented the troops on their devotion\r\nto him.[382] This made the auxiliaries grumble at the growing licence\r\nand impunity allowed to the legions. So the Batavians, for fear of\r\nsome desperate outbreak, were sent back to Germany, where Fortune was\r\ncontriving for us a war that was at once both civil and foreign.[383]\r\nThe Gallic auxiliaries were also sent home. Their numbers were very\r\nlarge, and had been used at the first outbreak of the rebellion for an\r\nempty parade of force. Indeed, the imperial finances were already\r\nembarrassed by the distribution of largess, to meet the expenses of\r\nwhich Vitellius gave orders for depleting the strength of the legions\r\nand auxiliaries. Recruiting was forbidden, and discharges offered\r\nwithout restriction. This policy was disastrous for the country and\r\nunpopular among the soldiers, who found that their turn for work and\r\ndanger came round all the more frequently, now that there were so few\r\nto share the duties. Besides, their efficiency was demoralized by\r\nluxury. Nothing was left of the old-fashioned discipline and the good\r\nrules of our ancestors, who preferred to base the security of Rome on\r\ncharacter and not on money.\r\n\r\nLeaving Ticinum Vitellius turned off to Cremona. There he               70\r\nwitnessed Caecina's games and conceived a wish to stand upon the field\r\nof Bedriacum, and to see the traces of the recent victory with his own\r\neyes. Within six weeks of the battle, it was a disgusting and horrible\r\nsight; mangled bodies, mutilated limbs, rotting carcasses of men and\r\nhorses, the ground foul with clotted blood. Trees and crops all\r\ntrampled down: the country-side a miserable waste. No less revolting\r\nto all human feeling was the stretch of road which the people of\r\nCremona had strewn with laurel-leaves and roses, erecting altars and\r\nsacrificing victims as if in honour of an Oriental despot.[384] The\r\nrejoicings of the moment soon turned to their destruction.[385] Valens\r\nand Caecina were in attendance and showed Vitellius over the\r\nbattle-field: this was where their legions had charged: the cavalry\r\ntook the field from here: this was where the auxiliaries were\r\noutflanked. The various officers[386] each praised their own exploits,\r\nadding a few false or, at any rate, exaggerated touches. The common\r\nsoldiers, too, turned gaily shouting from the high road to inspect the\r\nscene of their great struggle, gazing with wonder at the huge pile of\r\narms and heaps of bodies.[387] There were a few who reflected with\r\ntears of pity on the shifting chances of life. But Vitellius never\r\ntook his eyes off the field: never shuddered at the sight of all these\r\nthousands of Roman citizens lying unburied.[388] On the contrary, he\r\nwas very well pleased, and, unconscious of his own impending doom, he\r\noffered a sacrifice to the local deities.\r\n\r\nThey next came to Bononia, where Fabius Valens gave a gladiatorial      71\r\nshow, for which he had all the apparatus brought from Rome. The nearer\r\nthey drew to the city, the greater became the disorder of the march,\r\nwhich was now joined by troops of actors, eunuchs and the like, all in\r\nthe true spirit of Nero's court. For Vitellius always had a great\r\npersonal admiration for Nero. He used to follow him about to hear him\r\nsing, not under compulsion--many a decent man suffered that fate--but\r\nbecause he was the slave of his stomach, and had sold himself to\r\nluxury.\r\n\r\nTo secure a few months of office for Valens and Caecina, the other\r\nconsuls of the year[389] had their terms shortened, while Martius\r\nMacer's claim was ignored as belonging to Otho's party. Valerius\r\nMarinus, who had been nominated by Galba, had his term postponed, not\r\nfor any offence, but because he was a mild creature and too lazy to\r\nresent an injury. The name of Pedanius Costa was omitted altogether.\r\nVitellius had never forgiven him for rising against Nero and\r\ninstigating Verginius. However, he alleged other reasons. They all had\r\nto observe the servile custom of the time, and offer their thanks to\r\nVitellius.\r\n\r\nAn imposture, received at first with great excitement, failed to        72\r\nlast more than a few days. A man had appeared who gave out that he was\r\nScribonianus Camerinus,[390] and that during Nero's reign he had taken\r\nrefuge in Histria, where the Crassi still had their old connexions and\r\nestates, and their name was much respected. He accordingly took all\r\nthe rascals he could find and cast them for parts. The credulous mob\r\nand some of the soldiers, who were either victims of the imposture or\r\nanxious for a riot, eagerly flocked to join him. However, he was taken\r\nbefore Vitellius and his identity examined. When it was found that\r\nthere was no truth in his pretensions, and that his master recognized\r\nhim as a runaway called Geta, he suffered the execution of a\r\nslave.[391]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [329] i.e. the gladiators (cp. chap. 36).\r\n\r\n    [330] Modena.\r\n\r\n    [331] A famous orator and informer, who from small beginnings\r\n          acquired great wealth and influence under Nero.

He was probably related to M. Licinius\r\n          Crassus Frugi, who was convicted of treason against Nero (see\r\n          note 79), and to Piso, Galba's adopted successor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLT OF VESPASIAN\r\n\r\nWhen once his couriers brought news from Syria and Judaea that the      73\r\nEast had sworn allegiance to him, Vitellius' vanity and indolence\r\nreached a pitch which is almost incredible. For already, though the\r\nrumours were still vague and unreliable, Vespasian's name was in\r\neverybody's mouth, and the mention of him often roused Vitellius to\r\nalarm. Still, he and his army seemed to reck of no rival: they at once\r\nbroke out into the unbridled cruelty, debauchery and oppression of\r\nsome outlandish court.\r\n\r\nVespasian, on the other hand, was meditating war and reckoning all      74\r\nhis forces both distant and near at hand. He had so much attached his\r\ntroops to himself, that when he dictated to them the oath of\r\nallegiance and prayed that 'all might be well' with Vitellius, they\r\nlistened in silence. Mucianus' feelings were not hostile to him, and\r\nwere strongly sympathetic to Titus. Tiberius Alexander,[392] the\r\nGovernor of Egypt, had made common cause with him. The Third\r\nlegion,[393] since it had crossed from Syria into Moesia, he could\r\nreckon as his own, and there was good hope that the other legions of\r\nIllyria would follow its lead.[394] The whole army, indeed, was\r\nincensed at the arrogance of Vitellius' soldiers: truculent in\r\nappearance and rough of tongue, they scoffed at all the other troops\r\nas their inferiors. But a war of such magnitude demands delay. High as\r\nwere his hopes, Vespasian often calculated his risks. He realized that\r\nit would be a critical day for him when he committed his sixty summers\r\nand his two young sons to the chances of war. In his private ambitions\r\na man may feel his way and take less or more from fortune's hands\r\naccording as he feels inclined, but when one covets a throne there is\r\nno alternative between the zenith of success and headlong ruin.\r\nMoreover, he always kept in view the strength of the German army,       75\r\nwhich, as a soldier, he realized. His own legions, he knew, had no\r\nexperience of civil war, while Vitellius' troops were fresh from\r\nvictory: and the defeated party were richer in grievances than in\r\ntroops. Civil strife had undermined the loyalty of the troops: there\r\nwas danger in each single man. What would be the good of all his horse\r\nand foot, if one or two traitors should seek the reward the enemy\r\noffered and assassinate him then and there? It was thus that\r\nScribonianus[395] had been killed in Claudius' reign, and his\r\nmurderer, Volaginius, raised from a common soldier to the highest\r\nrank. It is easier to move men in the mass than to take precautions\r\nagainst them singly.\r\n\r\nThese anxieties made Vespasian hesitate. Meanwhile the other            76\r\ngenerals and his friends continued to encourage him. At last Mucianus\r\nafter several private interviews went so far as to address him in\r\npublic. 'Everybody,' he said, 'who plans some great exploit is bound\r\nto consider whether his enterprise serves both the public interest and\r\nhis own reputation, and whether it is easily practicable or, at any\r\nrate, not impossible. He must also weigh the advice which he gets. Are\r\nthose who offer it ready to run the risk themselves? And, if fortune\r\nfavours, who gains the glory? I myself, Vespasian, call you to the\r\nthrone. How much that may benefit the country and make you famous it\r\nlies with you--under Providence--to decide. You need not be afraid\r\nthat I may seem to flatter you. It is more of an insult than a\r\ncompliment to be chosen to succeed Vitellius. It is not against the\r\npowerful intellect of the sainted Augustus that we are in revolt; not\r\nagainst the cautious prudence of the old Tiberius; nor even against a\r\nlong-established imperial family like that of Caligula, Claudius or\r\nNero. You even gave way to Galba's ancient lineage. To remain inactive\r\nany longer, to leave your country to ruin and disgrace, that would be\r\nsheer sloth and cowardice, even if such slavery were as safe for you\r\nas it would be dishonourable. The time is long past when you could be\r\nmerely _suspected_ of ambition: the throne is now your only refuge.\r\nHave you forgotten Corbulo's murder?[396] He was a man of better\r\nfamily than we, I admit, but so was Nero more nobly born than\r\nVitellius. A man who is feared always seems illustrious enough to\r\nthose who fear him. That an army can make an emperor Vitellius himself\r\nhas proved. He had neither experience nor military reputation, but\r\nmerely rose on Galba's unpopularity. Even Otho fell not by the\r\nstrategy or strength of his opponent, but by his own precipitate\r\ndespair. And to-day he seems a great and desirable emperor, when\r\nVitellius is disbanding his legions, disarming his Guards, and daily\r\nsowing fresh seeds of civil war. Why, any spirit or enthusiasm which\r\nhis army had is being dissipated in drunken debauches: for they\r\nimitate their master. But you, in Judaea, in Syria, in Egypt, you have\r\nnine fresh legions. War has not weakened nor mutiny demoralized them.\r\nThe men are trained to discipline and have already won a foreign\r\nwar.[397] Besides these, you can rely on the strength of your\r\nfleet,[398] and of your auxiliaries both horse and foot, on the\r\nfaithful allegiance of foreign princes,[399] and on your own\r\nunparalleled experience.\r\n\r\n'For ourselves I make but one claim. Let us not rank below Valens       77\r\nand Caecina. Nor must you despise my help because you do not encounter\r\nmy rivalry. I prefer myself to Vitellius and you to myself. Your house\r\nhas received the insignia of a triumph.[400] You have two young sons,\r\none of whom is already old enough to fill the throne, and in his first\r\nyears of service made a name for himself in the German army.[401] It\r\nwould be absurd for me not to give way to one whose son I should\r\nadopt, were I emperor myself. Apart from this, we shall stand on a\r\ndifferent footing in success and in failure, for if we succeed I shall\r\nhave such honour as you grant me: of the risk and the dangers we shall\r\nshare the burden equally. Or rather, do what is better still. Dispose\r\nyour armies yourself and leave me the conduct of the war, and the\r\nuncertainties of battle.\r\n\r\n'At this moment the defeated are far more strictly disciplined than\r\ntheir conquerors. Indignation, hatred, the passion for revenge, all\r\nserve to steel our courage. Theirs is dulled by pride and mutiny. The\r\ncourse of the war will soon bring to light the hidden weakness of\r\ntheir party, and reopen all its festering sores. I rely on your\r\nvigilance, your economy, your wisdom, and still more on the indolence,\r\nignorance, and cruelty of Vitellius. Above all, our cause is far safer\r\nin war than in peace, for those who plan rebellion have rebelled\r\nalready.'\r\n\r\nAt the end of Mucianus' speech the others all pressed round with        78\r\nnew confidence, offering their encouragement and quoting the answers\r\nof soothsayers and the movements of the stars. Nor was Vespasian\r\nuninfluenced by superstition. In later days, when he was master of\r\nthe world, he made no secret of keeping a soothsayer called Seleucus\r\nto help him by his advice and prophecy. Early omens began to recur to\r\nhis memory. A tall and conspicuous cypress on his estate had once\r\nsuddenly collapsed: on the next day it had risen again on the same\r\nspot to grow taller and broader than ever. The soothsayers had agreed\r\nthat this was an omen of great success, and augured the height of fame\r\nfor the still youthful Vespasian. At first his triumphal honours, his\r\nconsulship, and the name he won by his Jewish victory seemed to have\r\nfulfilled the promise of this omen. But having achieved all this, he\r\nbegan to believe that it portended his rise to the throne.\r\n\r\nOn the frontier of Judaea and Syria[402] lies a hill called Carmel. A\r\ngod of the same name is there worshipped according to ancient ritual.\r\nThere is no image or temple: only an altar where they reverently\r\nworship. Once when Vespasian was sacrificing on this altar, brooding\r\non his secret ambition, the priest, Basilides, after a minute\r\ninspection of the omens said to him: 'Whatever it is which you have in\r\nmind, Vespasian, whether it is to build a house or to enlarge your\r\nestate, or to increase the number of your slaves, there is granted to\r\nyou a great habitation, vast acres, and a multitude of men.' Rumour\r\nhad immediately seized on this riddle and now began to solve it.\r\nNothing was more talked of, especially in Vespasian's presence: such\r\nconversation is the food of hope.\r\n\r\nHaving come to a definite decision they departed, Mucianus to Antioch,\r\nVespasian to Caesarea. The former is the capital of Syria, the latter\r\nof Judaea.[403]\r\n\r\nThe first offer of the throne to Vespasian was made at Alexandria,      79\r\nwhere Tiberius Alexander with great promptitude administered the oath\r\nof allegiance to his troops on the first of July. This was usually\r\ncelebrated as his day of accession, although it was not until the\r\nthird that the Jewish army took the oath in his presence. So eager was\r\ntheir enthusiasm that they would not even wait for the arrival of\r\nTitus, who was on his way back from Syria, where he had been\r\nconducting the negotiations between his father and Mucianus.\r\n\r\nWhat happened was all due to the impulse of the soldiers: there was no\r\nset speech, no formal assembly of the troops. They were still           80\r\ndiscussing the time and the place, and trying to decide the hardest\r\npoint of all, who should speak first, and while their minds were still\r\nbusy with hopes and fears, reasons and chances, Vespasian happened to\r\ncome out of his quarters. A few of the soldiers, forming up in the\r\nusual way to salute their general, saluted him as emperor. The others\r\npromptly rushed up calling him Caesar and Augustus, and heaping on him\r\nall the imperial titles. Their fears at once gave way to confidence.\r\nVespasian himself, unchanged by the change of fortune, showed no sign\r\nof vanity or arrogance. As soon as he had recovered from the dazzling\r\nshock of his sudden elevation, he addressed them in simple soldier\r\nfashion, and received a shower of congratulations from every quarter.\r\nMucianus, who had been waiting for this, administered the oath of\r\nallegiance to his eager troops, and then entered the theatre at\r\nAntioch, where the Greeks ordinarily hold their debates. There, as the\r\nfawning crowd came flocking in, he addressed them in their own tongue.\r\nFor he could speak elegant Greek, and had the art of making the most\r\nof all he said or did. What most served to inflame the excitement of\r\nthe province and of the army, was his statement that Vitellius had\r\ndetermined to transfer the German legions to peaceful service in the\r\nrich province of Syria, and to send the Syrian legions to endure the\r\ntoil and rigours of a winter in Germany. The provincials were\r\naccustomed to the soldiers' company and liked to have them quartered\r\nthere, and many were bound to them by ties of intimacy and kinship,\r\nwhile the soldiers in their long term of service had come to know and\r\nlove their old camp like a home.\r\n\r\nBefore the 15th of July the whole of Syria had sworn allegiance.        81\r\nThe party also gained the support of Sohaemus,[404] with all the\r\nresources of his kingdom and a considerable force, and of\r\nAntiochus,[404] the richest of the subject princes, who owed his\r\nimportance to his ancestral treasures. Before long Agrippa, too,\r\nreceived a secret summons from his friends at home, and leaving\r\nRome[405] without the knowledge of Vitellius, sailed as fast as he\r\ncould to join Vespasian. His sister Berenice[406] showed equal\r\nenthusiasm for the cause. She was then in the flower of her youth and\r\nbeauty, and her munificent gifts to Vespasian quite won the old man's\r\nheart. Indeed, every province on the seaboard as far as Asia and\r\nAchaia, and inland to Pontus and Armenia swore allegiance to\r\nVespasian, but their governors were without troops, for as yet no\r\nlegions had been assigned to Cappadocia.[407]\r\n\r\nA meeting was held at Berytus[408] to discuss the general situation.\r\nTo this came Mucianus with all his officers and the most distinguished\r\nof his centurions and soldiers, besides the elite of the Jewish army\r\nin full uniform. All these cavalry and infantry, and the pageant of\r\nthe subject princes, vying with each other in splendour, gave the\r\nmeeting an air of imperial grandeur.\r\n\r\nThe first step was to levy new troops and to recall the veterans        82\r\nto the standards. Some of the strongest towns were told off to\r\nmanufacture arms. New gold and silver were coined at Antioch. All\r\nthese works were promptly carried out, each in the proper place, by\r\ncompetent officials. Vespasian came and inspected them himself,\r\nencouraging good work by his praises and rousing the inefficient\r\nrather by example than compulsion, always more ready to see the merits\r\nthan the faults of his friends. Many were rewarded by receiving\r\ncommands in the auxiliary forces or posts as imperial agents.[409]\r\nStill more were raised to senatorial rank. They were mostly men of\r\ndistinction who soon rose high, and with others success atoned for any\r\nlack of merit. A donation for the troops had been mentioned by\r\nMucianus in his first speech, but in very guarded terms. Even\r\nVespasian offered for the civil war a lower figure than others gave in\r\ntime of peace, for he had set his face with admirable firmness against\r\nlargess to the soldiers, and his army was none the worse for it.\r\nEnvoys were dispatched to Parthia and Armenia to secure that the\r\nlegions, while engaged in the civil war, should not be exposed to\r\nattack in the rear.[410] It was arranged that Titus should carry on\r\nthe war in Judaea, while Vespasian held the keys of Egypt.[411]\r\nAgainst Vitellius it seemed sufficient to send a part of their forces\r\nunder the command of Mucianus. He would have Vespasian's name behind\r\nhim and the irresistible force of destiny. Letters were written to\r\nall the armies and their generals with instructions that they should\r\ntry to win over those of the Guards who were hostile to Vitellius by\r\npromising them renewal of service.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mucianus, who acted the part more of a partner than a        83\r\nsubordinate, moved forward without the encumbrance of baggage, neither\r\nmarching so slowly as to look like holding back, nor so rapidly as not\r\nto allow time for rumours to spread. He realized that his force was\r\nsmall, and that the less people saw the more they would believe of it.\r\nHowever, he had a solid column following in support, composed of the\r\nSixth legion and some picked detachments numbering 13,000 men.[412] He\r\nhad ordered the fleet to move from Pontus to Byzantium, for he was\r\nhalf-minded to leave Moesia and with his whole force to hold\r\nDyrrachium, at the same time using his fleet to dominate the Italian\r\nsea. He would thus secure Greece and Asia in his rear, which would\r\notherwise be at the mercy of Vitellius, unless furnished with troops.\r\nVitellius also would himself be in doubt what points of the Italian\r\ncoast to defend, if Mucianus with his ships threatened both Brundisium\r\nand Tarentum and the whole coastline of Calabria and Lucania.\r\n\r\nThus the provinces rang from end to end with the preparations for       84\r\nships, soldiers and arms. But the heaviest burden was the raising of\r\nmoney. 'Funds,' said Mucianus, 'are the sinews of war,'[413] and in\r\nhis investigations he cared for neither justice nor equity, but solely\r\nfor the amount of the sum. Informers abounded, and pounced on every\r\nrich man as their prey. This intolerable oppression, excused by the\r\nnecessities of war, was allowed to continue even in peace. It was not\r\nso much that Vespasian at the beginning of his reign had made up his\r\nmind to maintain unjust decisions, but fortune spoilt him; he had\r\nlearnt in a bad school and made a bold use of his lessons. Mucianus\r\nalso contributed from his private means, of which he was generous, as\r\nhe hoped to get a high rate of interest out of the country. Others\r\nfollowed his example, but very few had his opportunity of recovering\r\ntheir money.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Vespasian's progress was accelerated by the             85\r\nenthusiasm with which the Illyrian army[414] espoused his cause. The\r\nThird set the example to the other legions of Moesia, the Eighth and\r\nthe Seventh Claudian, both strongly attached to Otho, although they\r\nhad not been present at the battle. On their arrival at Aquileia[415]\r\nthey had mobbed the couriers who brought the news of Otho's fall, and\r\ntorn to pieces the standards bearing Vitellius' name, finally looting\r\nthe camp-chest and dividing the money among themselves. These were\r\nhostile acts. Alarmed at what they had done they began to reflect\r\nthat, while their conduct needed excuse before Vitellius, they could\r\nmake a merit of it with Vespasian. Accordingly, the three Moesian\r\nlegions addressed letters to the Pannonian army,[416] inviting their\r\nco-operation, and meanwhile prepared to meet refusal with force.\r\n\r\nAponius Saturninus, the Governor of Moesia, took this opportunity to\r\nattempt an abominable crime. He sent a centurion to murder Tettius\r\nJulianus,[417] who commanded the Seventh legion, alleging the\r\ninterests of his party as a cloak for a personal quarrel. Julianus\r\nheard of his danger and, taking some guides who knew the country,\r\nescaped into the wilds of Moesia and got as far as Mount Haemus.[418]\r\nAfter that he meddled no more in civil war. Starting to join\r\nVespasian, he prolonged his journey by various expedients, retarding\r\nor hastening his pace according to the nature of the news he received.\r\n\r\nIn Pannonia the Thirteenth legion and the Seventh Galbian had not       86\r\nforgotten their feelings after the battle of Bedriacum. They lost no\r\ntime in joining Vespasian's cause, being chiefly instigated by\r\nAntonius Primus. This man was a criminal who had been convicted of\r\nfraud[419] during Nero's reign. Among the many evils of the war was\r\nhis recovery of senatorial rank. Galba gave him command of the\r\nSeventh legion, and he was believed to have written repeatedly to Otho\r\noffering his services as general to the party. But, as Otho took no\r\nnotice of him, he was without employment in the war. When Vitellius'\r\ncause began to decline, he joined Vespasian and proved an acquisition.\r\nHe was a man of great physical energy and a ready tongue; an artist in\r\ncalumny, invaluable in riots and sedition. Light-fingered and\r\nfree-handed, he was intolerable in peace, but by no means contemptible\r\nin war. The union of the Moesian and Pannonian armies soon attracted\r\nthe troops in Dalmatia to the cause. Tampius Flavianus and Pompeius\r\nSilvanus, the two ex-consuls who governed respectively Pannonia and\r\nDalmatia,[420] were wealthy old gentlemen who had no thought of\r\nrising. But the imperial agent in Pannonia, Cornelius Fuscus, was a\r\nvigorous young man of good family. In his early youth a desire to make\r\nmoney[421] had led him to resign his senatorial rank. He had headed\r\nthe townsmen of his colony in declaring for Galba, and his services\r\nhad won him a position as imperial agent.[422] Then he joined\r\nVespasian's party, giving a keen stimulus to the war; for, being\r\nattracted more by danger itself than by its prizes, he always disliked\r\nwhat was certain and long established, preferring everything that was\r\nnew and dangerous and doubtful. So the Vespasian party used all their\r\nefforts to fan every spark of discontent throughout the empire.\r\nLetters were sent to the Fourteenth in Britain and to the First in\r\nSpain,[423] since both these legions had stood for Otho against\r\nVitellius. In Gaul, too, letters were scattered broadcast. All in an\r\ninstant the war was in full flame. The armies of Illyricum openly\r\nrevolted, and all the others were ready to follow the first sign of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [391] i.e. he was crucified.\r\n\r\n    [392] See note 30.\r\n\r\n    [393] Cp. i. 79.\r\n\r\n    [394] This hope was fulfilled (chap. 85).\r\n\r\n    [395] See i. 89.\r\n\r\n    [396] Under Nero, after brilliant service in Armenia and\r\n          Parthia.

In the _Annals_ (xvi. 17) Tacitus\r\n          says that Annaeus Mela abstained from seeking public office,\r\n          because he 'hoped to find a shorter road to wealth' by\r\n          entering, as Fuscus did, the imperial civil service. The\r\n          statement that Fuscus loved danger better than money does not\r\n          imply any rooted antipathy to the latter.\r\n\r\n    [422] i.e. in Pannonia.\r\n\r\n    [423] Cp. chaps. 66 and 67.\r\n\r\n\r\nVITELLIUS IN ROME\r\n\r\nWhile[424] Vespasian and his generals were showing such activity        87\r\nin the provinces, Vitellius grew more contemptible and indolent every\r\nday. Halting at every town or country house that offered any\r\nattractions, he made his way to Rome with a heavy marching column of\r\nsixty thousand troops, demoralized by loose discipline, and an even\r\ngreater number of menials as well as those camp-followers who are more\r\ntroublesome than any slaves. Besides these he had the vast retinue of\r\nhis generals and friends, which not even the strictest discipline\r\ncould have kept under control. This mob was further encumbered by\r\nsenators and knights, who came from Rome to meet him, some from fear,\r\nsome from servility; and gradually all the others followed, so as not\r\nto be left behind by themselves. There flocked in, too, a crowd of\r\nlow-bred buffoons, actors and chariot-drivers, who had gained\r\nVitellius' acquaintance by various dishonest services. He delighted in\r\nsuch discreditable connexions. To furnish supplies for this host not\r\nonly were the colonies and country towns laid under contribution, but\r\nthe farmers as well. The crops were just ripe and the fields were\r\nravaged like an enemy's country.\r\n\r\nMany murderous affrays took place among the soldiers, for after         88\r\nthe mutiny at Ticinum[425] there were ceaseless quarrels between the\r\nlegions and the auxiliaries. They only united to harry the villagers.\r\nThe worst bloodshed took place at the seventh milestone from Rome.\r\nHere Vitellius had ready-cooked food served to each of the soldiers,\r\nas is done with gladiators in training, and the common people flocked\r\nout from Rome and wandered all over the camp. Some of these visitors\r\nindulged in a cockney practical joke,[426] and stole some of the\r\nsoldiers' swords, quietly cutting their belts while their attention\r\nwas diverted. Then they kept asking them, 'Have you got your sword\r\non?' The troops were not used to being laughed at, and refused to\r\ntolerate it. They charged the defenceless crowd. Amongst others the\r\nfather of one of the soldiers was killed while in his son's company.\r\nWhen it was discovered who he was, and the news spread, they shed no\r\nmore innocent blood. Still there was some panic in the city as the\r\nfirst soldiers arrived and began to roam the streets. They mostly made\r\nfor the Forum, anxious to see the spot where Galba had fallen.[427]\r\nThey themselves were a sufficiently alarming sight with their rough\r\nskin coats and long pikes. Unused to towns, they failed to pick their\r\nway in the crowd; or they would slip on the greasy streets, or collide\r\nwith some one and tumble down, whereupon they took to abuse and before\r\nlong to violence. Their officers, too, terrified the city by sweeping\r\nalong the streets with their bands of armed men.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Mulvian bridge, Vitellius himself had been           89\r\nriding on a conspicuous horse, wearing his sword and general's\r\nuniform, with the senate and people trooping in front of him. However,\r\nas this looked too much like an entry into a captured city, his\r\nfriends persuaded him to change into civilian dress and walk on foot.\r\nAt the head of his column were carried the eagles of four legions,\r\nsurrounded by the colours belonging to the detachments of four other\r\nlegions.[428] Next came the standards of twelve regiments of\r\nauxiliary horse, then the files of infantry and the cavalry behind\r\nthem. Then came thirty-four cohorts of auxiliaries, arranged according\r\nto their nationality or the nature of their weapons. In front of the\r\neagles came the camp prefects and tribunes, and the senior\r\ncenturions,[429] all dressed in white. The other centurions marched\r\neach at the head of his company, glittering with their armour and\r\ndecorations. Gaily, too, shone the soldiers' medals[430] and their\r\nchains of honour. It was a noble spectacle, an army worthy of a better\r\nemperor. Thus Vitellius entered the Capitol, where he embraced his\r\nmother and conferred on her the title of Augusta.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Vitellius delivered a grandiloquent eulogy on      90\r\nhis own merits. He might have been addressing the senate and people of\r\nsome other state, for he extolled his own industry and self-control,\r\nalthough each member of his audience had seen his infamy for himself,\r\nand the whole of Italy had witnessed during his march the shameful\r\nspectacle of his sloth and luxury. However, the thoughtless crowd\r\ncould not discriminate between truth and falsehood. They had learnt\r\nthe usual flatteries by heart and chimed in with loud shouts of\r\napplause. They insisted in the face of his protests that he should\r\ntake the title of Augustus. But neither his refusal nor their\r\ninsistence made much difference.[431]\r\n\r\nIn Rome nothing passes without comment, and it was regarded as a        91\r\nfatal omen that Vitellius took office as high priest, and issued his\r\nencyclical on public worship on the 18th of July, which, as the\r\nanniversary of the disasters on the Cremera and the Allia,[432] had\r\nlong been considered an unlucky day. But his ignorance of all civil\r\nand religious precedent was only equalled by the incapacity of his\r\nfreedmen and friends. He seemed to live in a society of drunkards.\r\nHowever, at the consular elections he canvassed for his candidates\r\nlike a common citizen.[433] In everything he courted the favour of the\r\nlowest classes, attending performances in the theatre and backing his\r\nfavourite at the races. This would undoubtedly have made him popular\r\nhad his motives been good, but the memory of his former life made his\r\nconduct seem cheap and discreditable. He constantly attended the\r\nsenate, even when the debates were on trivial matters. It once\r\nhappened that Helvidius Priscus,[434] then praetor-elect, opposed\r\nVitellius' policy. At first the emperor showed annoyance, but was\r\ncontent to appeal to the tribunes of the people to come to the rescue\r\nof his slighted authority. Afterwards, when his friends, fearing that\r\nhis resentment might be deep-seated, tried to smooth matters, he\r\nreplied that there was nothing strange in two senators disagreeing on\r\na question of public policy: he himself had often opposed even such a\r\nman as Thrasea. Most people laughed at the impudence of this\r\ncomparison; others were gratified that he had selected Thrasea, and\r\nnot some court favourite, as an example of real distinction.[435]\r\n\r\nVitellius had given the command of the Guards to Publilius              92\r\nSabinus, who had commanded an auxiliary cohort,[436] and Julius\r\nPriscus, hitherto only a centurion. Priscus owed his rise to Valens'\r\nsupport, Sabinus to that of Caecina. The rivalry between Valens and\r\nCaecina left Vitellius no authority at all. They managed the\r\ngovernment between them. They had long felt the strain of mutual\r\ndislike. During the war they had concealed it. Lately it had been\r\nfanned by dishonest friends and by life in the city, which so easily\r\nbreeds quarrels. They were constant rivals, comparing their respective\r\npopularity, the number of their retinue, the size of the crowds that\r\ncame to wait upon them. Meanwhile Vitellius let his favour alternate\r\nbetween them, for personal influence is not to be trusted beyond a\r\ncertain limit. Meanwhile, they both feared and despised the emperor\r\nhimself, who thus veered between sudden brusqueness and unseasonable\r\nflattery. However, they were not in the least deterred from seizing on\r\nthe houses, gardens, and funds in the emperor's patronage, while the\r\ncrowd of miserable and needy nobles, whom Galba had recalled from\r\nexile with their children, derived no assistance from the emperor's\r\nliberality. He earned the approval both of the upper classes and of\r\nthe people by granting to the restored full rights over their\r\nfreedmen.[437] But the freed slaves with characteristic meanness did\r\nall they could to invalidate the edict. They would hide their money\r\nwith some obscure friend or in a rich patron's safe. Some, indeed, had\r\npassed into the imperial household and become more influential than\r\ntheir masters.\r\n\r\nAs for the soldiers, the Guards' barracks were crowded, and the         93\r\noverflow spread through the city, finding shelter in colonnades and\r\ntemples. They ceased to recognize any head-quarters, to go on guard,\r\nor to keep themselves in training, but fell victims to the attractions\r\nof city life and its unmentionable vices, until they deteriorated both\r\nphysically and morally through idleness and debauchery. A number of\r\nthem even imperilled their lives by settling in the pestilent Vatican\r\nquarter, thus increasing the rate of mortality. They were close to the\r\nTiber, and the Germans and Gauls, who were peculiarly liable to\r\ndisease and could ill stand the heat, ruined their constitutions by\r\ntheir immoderate use of the river.[438] Moreover, the generals, either\r\nfor bribes or to earn popularity, tampered with the rules of the\r\nservice, enrolling sixteen regiments of Guards[439] and four for the\r\ncity garrison, each composed of a thousand men. In enlisting these\r\ntroops Valens put himself forward as superior to Caecina, whose life\r\nhe claimed to have saved. It is true, indeed, that his arrival had\r\nconsolidated the party, and by his successful engagement he had\r\nsilenced the current criticism of their slow marching. Besides which\r\nthe whole of the army of Lower Germany was attached to Valens, and\r\nthis is said to be the reason why Caecina's loyalty first wavered.\r\n\r\nWhatever indulgence Vitellius showed to his generals, he allowed        94\r\nstill more licence to the troops. Each man chose his service. However\r\nunfit, he might enlist in the Guards, if he preferred it. On the\r\nother hand, good soldiers were allowed, if they wished, to remain in\r\nthe legions or the auxiliary cavalry. Many wished to do this who\r\nsuffered from ill health and complained of the climate. However, the\r\nbest soldiers were thus withdrawn from the legions and from the\r\ncavalry; and the Guards were robbed of their prestige when twenty\r\nthousand men were thus not so much selected for service with them as\r\ndrafted at random from the whole army.\r\n\r\nWhile Vitellius was addressing the troops, they demanded the execution\r\nof three Gallic chieftains, Asiaticus, Flavus, and Rufinus, on the\r\nground that they had fought for Vindex.[440] Vitellius never checked\r\nthese outcries. For, apart from the innate cowardice of his nature, he\r\nknew that his donation to the soldiers was nearly due, and that he had\r\nno money for it; so he freely granted all their other demands. The\r\nimperial freedmen were forced to contribute a sort of tax,\r\nproportionate to the number of their slaves. Meanwhile, his one\r\nserious occupation was extravagance. He built stables for\r\nchariot-drivers, filled the arena with gorgeous shows of gladiators\r\nand wild beasts, and fooled away his money as though he had more than\r\nhe wanted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Valens and Caecina celebrated Vitellius' birthday[441]        95\r\nby holding gladiatorial shows in every quarter of Rome on a scale of\r\nmagnificence hitherto unknown. Vitellius then gratified the rabble and\r\nscandalized all decent people by building altars in the Martian Plain,\r\nand holding a funeral service in honour of Nero. Victims were killed\r\nand burnt in public: the torch was applied by the Augustales, members\r\nof the college which Tiberius Caesar had founded in honour of the\r\nJulian family, just as Romulus similarly commemorated King Tatius.\r\n\r\nIt was not yet four months since Vitellius' victory, and yet his\r\nfreedman Asiaticus was as bad as a Polyclitus or a Patrobius,[442] or\r\nany of the favourites whose names were hated in earlier days. At this\r\ncourt no one strove to rise by honesty or capacity. There was only one\r\nroad to power. By lavish banquets, costly profusion, and feats of\r\ngastronomy, you had to try and satisfy Vitellius' insatiable gluttony.\r\nHe himself, without thought for the morrow, was well content to enjoy\r\nthe present. It is believed that he squandered nine hundred million\r\nsesterces[443] in these brief months. Truly it shows Rome's greatness\r\nand misfortune, that she endured Otho and Vitellius both in the same\r\nyear, and suffered humiliation of every kind at the hands of men like\r\nVinius and Fabius,[444] Icelus and Asiaticus, until at last they gave\r\nway to Mucianus and Marcellus--a change of men but not of manners.\r\n\r\nThe first news of rebellion which reached Vitellius came from           96\r\nAponius Saturninus,[445] who, before himself going over to Vespasian's\r\nside, wrote to announce the desertion of the Third legion. But a\r\nsudden crisis makes a man nervous: Aponius did not tell the whole\r\nstory. So the emperor's flattering friends began to explain it all\r\naway: what was the defection of a single legion, while the loyalty of\r\nthe other armies remained unshaken? Vitellius himself used the same\r\nlanguage to the soldiers. He accused the men, who had been recently\r\ndischarged from the Guards,[446] of spreading false rumours, and kept\r\nassuring them there was no fear of civil war. All mention of Vespasian\r\nwas suppressed, and soldiers were sent round the city to frighten\r\npeople into silence, which, of course, did more than anything else to\r\nmake them talk.\r\n\r\nVitellius, nevertheless, sent for reinforcements from Germany,          97\r\nBritain, and the Spanish provinces, though with a lack of urgency\r\nwhich was intended to conceal his straits. The provinces and their\r\ngovernors showed the same want of enthusiasm. Hordeonius Flaccus,[447]\r\nwho had suspicions of the Batavi, was distracted with a war of his\r\nown,[448] while Vettius Bolanus[449] never had Britain under complete\r\ncontrol: nor was the loyally of either beyond doubt. The Spanish\r\nprovinces, where there was at the time no consular governor,[450] were\r\nequally slow. The three officers in command of the legions held an\r\nequal authority, and if Vitellius' cause had prospered, would have\r\neach outbid the other for his favour: but they all shared the resolve\r\nto leave his misfortunes alone. In Africa the legion and auxiliaries\r\nenlisted by Clodius Macer, and subsequently disbanded by Galba,[451]\r\ntook service again at Vitellius' orders, and at the same time all the\r\nyoung men of the province eagerly enlisted. Vitellius had been an\r\nhonest and popular pro-consul in Africa, while Vespasian had been\r\ndistrusted and disliked. The provincials took this as an earnest of\r\ntheir reigns; but experience proved them wrong.\r\n\r\nThe military legate Valerius Festus[452] at first loyally seconded      98\r\nthe enthusiasm of the province. After a while he began to waver. In\r\nhis official letters and edicts he still acknowledged Vitellius, while\r\nin secret communication with Vespasian and ready to support whichever\r\nparty proved successful. In Raetia and the Gallic provinces some\r\ncenturions and men carrying letters and edicts from Vespasian were\r\ntaken prisoners and sent to Vitellius, who had them executed. But most\r\nof these envoys escaped capture either by their own ingenuity or the\r\nloyal help of friends. Thus, while Vitellius' plans were known,\r\nVespasian's were for the most part still a secret. This was partly due\r\nto Vitellius' negligence, but also to the fact that the garrisons on\r\nthe Pannonian Alps stopped all messengers. By sea, too, the\r\nEtesian[453] winds from the north-west favoured ships sailing\r\neastward, but hindered the voyage from the East.\r\n\r\nTerrified at last by the imminence of invasion and the alarming         99\r\nnews that reached him from all quarters, Vitellius instructed Caecina\r\nand Valens to prepare for war. Caecina was sent on ahead, Valens, who\r\nwas just recovering from a serious illness, being delayed by his weak\r\nstate of health. Great, indeed, was the change in the appearance of\r\nthe German army as it marched out of Rome. There was neither energy in\r\ntheir muscles nor fire in their hearts. Slowly the column straggled\r\non, their horses spiritless, their arms neglected. The men grumbled at\r\nthe sun, the dust, the weather, and were as ready to quarrel as they\r\nwere unwilling to work. To these disadvantages were added Caecina's\r\ninveterate self-seeking and his newly-acquired indolence. An overdose\r\nof success had made him slack and self-indulgent, or, if he was\r\nplotting treachery, this may have been one of his devices for\r\ndemoralizing the army. It has often been believed that it was Flavius\r\nSabinus[454] who, using Rubrius Gallus as his agent, tampered with\r\nCaecina's loyalty by promising that, if he came over, Vespasian would\r\nratify any conditions. It may have occurred also to Caecina to\r\nremember his quarrels and rivalry with Valens, and to consider that,\r\nas he did not stand first with Vitellius, he had better acquire credit\r\nand influence with the new emperor.\r\n\r\nAfter taking an affectionate and respectful farewell of Vitellius,     100\r\nCaecina dispatched a body of cavalry to occupy Cremona. He soon\r\nfollowed with the detachments of the First, Fourth, Fifteenth, and\r\nSixteenth legions in the van. The centre was composed of the Fifth and\r\nTwenty-second, and in the rear of the column came the Twenty-first\r\nRapax and the First Italian legion, with detachments from the three\r\nlegions of Britain and a select force of auxiliaries. When Caecina had\r\nstarted, Valens wrote instructions to the legions belonging to his old\r\ncommand[455] to await him on the march, saying that he and Caecina had\r\narranged this. Caecina, however, took advantage of being on the spot,\r\nand pretended that this plan had been altered so as to enable them to\r\nmeet the first outbreak of the war with their full strength. So some\r\nlegions were hurried forward to Cremona[456] and part of the force was\r\ndirected upon Hostilia.[457] Caecina himself turned aside to Ravenna\r\non the pretext of giving instructions to the fleet. Thence he\r\nproceeded to Patavium[458] to secure secrecy for his treacherous\r\ndesigns. For Lucilius Bassus, whom Vitellius, from a prefect of\r\nauxiliary cavalry had raised to the supreme command of the two fleets\r\nat Ravenna and Misenum, felt aggrieved at not being immediately given\r\nthe praefecture of the Guards, and sought in dastardly treachery the\r\nremedy for his unjustifiable annoyance. It can never be known whether\r\nhe influenced Caecina or whether one was as dishonest as the other.\r\nThere is seldom much to choose between rascals. The historians[459]    101\r\nwho compiled the records of this war in the days of the Flavian\r\ndynasty were led by flattery into adducing as the causes of the\r\nrebellion patriotism and the interests of peace. We cannot think them\r\n right. Apart from the innate disloyalty of the rebels and the loss\r\nof character after Galba's betrayal, they seem to have been led by\r\njealousy and rivalry into sacrificing Vitellius himself for fear that\r\nthey might lose the first place in his favour. Thus when Caecina\r\njoined his army,[460] he used every device to undermine the staunch\r\nfidelity of the centurions and soldiers to Vitellius. Bassus found\r\nthe same task less difficult, for the fleet remembered that they had\r\nlately been in Otho's service, and were therefore already on the\r\nbrink of rebellion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [424] The narrative is here resumed from chap. 72.\r\n\r\n    [425] See chap. 68.\r\n\r\n    [426] The word 'cockney' may perhaps be admitted here to\r\n          express that which is characteristic of the metropolitan\r\n          masses. Similarly Petronius speaks of a man as 'a fountain of\r\n          cockney humour' (_urbanitatis vernaculae fontem_).\r\n\r\n    [427] They were cast for the part of Galba's avengers.\r\n\r\n    [428] Only detachments of these latter four were present, so\r\n          they had not got their eagles.\r\n\r\n    [429] Under the empire there were six tribunes to each legion,\r\n          and they took command on the march and on the field, acting\r\n          under the orders of the _legatus legionis_. The ten centurions\r\n          of the _pilani_ or front rank each commanded his cohort.\r\n\r\n    [430] See note 107.\r\n\r\n    [431] The end was so near.\r\n\r\n    [432] At Cremera, near Veii, the Fabii died like heroes, 477 B.C.,\r\n          and on the Allia the Gauls won their victory over Rome,\r\n          390 B.C. The day was called Alliensis, and no work was to be\r\n          done on it (Livy, vi. 1).\r\n\r\n    [433] See chap. 71. At this time the emperor had in theory\r\n          only the right of nominating candidates for the consulships,\r\n          but it was obviously unnecessary for him to do more.

Here Vitellius is posing as an ordinary senator. If\r\n          he had opposed so distinguished a man as Thrasea, why should\r\n          not Helvidius oppose him? Thrasea's end gives the remark a\r\n          slightly sinister tone.\r\n\r\n    [436] See note 346.\r\n\r\n    [437] A patron apparently could claim support from his\r\n          freedmen if he was in want, as these restored exiles certainly\r\n          were, since their property had been confiscated and was\r\n          irrecoverable.

They had met at Poetovio[1]\r\nat the head-quarters of the Third legion, where they debated whether\r\nthey should block the passage of the Pannonian Alps and wait until\r\ntheir whole strength came up to reinforce them, or whether they should\r\ntake a bolder line, assume the offensive, and strike for Italy. Those\r\nwho were in favour of waiting for reinforcements and prolonging the\r\nwar dwelt on the strength and reputation of the German legions, and\r\npointed out that the flower of the British army had lately arrived in\r\nRome with Vitellius;[2] their own forces were numerically inferior and\r\nhad recently suffered defeat; moreover, conquered troops, however bold\r\ntheir language, never show the same courage. On the other hand, if\r\nthey occupied the Alps, Mucianus would soon arrive with the forces\r\nfrom the East. Besides, Vespasian still[3] commanded the sea, and\r\ncould count on the support of the fleets[4] and of the provinces,\r\nwhere he could still raise material for a sort of second war. A\r\nsalutary delay would bring them fresh forces without in any way\r\nprejudicing their present position.\r\n\r\nIn answer to these arguments Antonius Primus,[5] who had done more       2\r\nthan any one else to stir up the war, stoutly maintained that prompt\r\naction would save them and ruin Vitellius. 'Their victory,' he said,\r\n'has not served to inspirit but to enervate them. The men are not held\r\nin readiness in camp, but are loitering in towns all over Italy. No\r\none but their hosts has any call to fear them. The more unruly and\r\nferocious they showed themselves before, the greater the greed with\r\nwhich they now indulge in unwonted draughts of pleasure. The circus,\r\nthe theatre, and the charms of the capital have ruined their hardness\r\nand their health. But if we give them time to train for war they will\r\nregain their energy. It is not far to Germany, whence they draw their\r\nmain strength. Britain is only separated by a narrow channel. Close at\r\nhand they have Gaul and Spain, from the provinces of which they can\r\nget men, horses, and subsidies. Then again, they can rely on Italy\r\nitself and all the resources of the capital, while, if they want to\r\ntake the offensive, they have two fleets[6] and full command of the\r\nIllyrian Sea.[7] Besides, what good to us are the ramparts of the\r\nmountains? Why should we drag on the war into another summer? Where\r\ncan we get funds and supplies in the meanwhile? No, let us seize our\r\nopportunity. The Pannonian legions are burning to rise in revenge.\r\nThey were not defeated but deceived.[8] The Moesian army has not yet\r\nlost a man. If you count not legions but men, our forces are superior\r\nboth in numbers and in character. The very shame of our defeat[9]\r\nmakes for good discipline. And even then our cavalry was not beaten.\r\nFor though we lost the day, they shattered the enemy's line.[10] And\r\nwhat was the force that broke through the Vitellians? Two regiments of\r\ncavalry from Pannonia and Moesia. What have we now? Sixteen regiments.\r\nWill not their combined forces, as they roar and thunder down upon the\r\nenemy, burying them in clouds of dust, overwhelm these horses and\r\nhorsemen that have forgotten how to fight? I have given you my plan,\r\nand, unless I am stopped, I will put it in operation. Some of you have\r\nnot yet burnt your boats.[11] Well, you can keep back the legions.\r\nGive me the auxiliaries in light marching order. They will be enough\r\nfor me. You will soon hear that the door of Italy is open and the\r\npower of Vitellius shaken. You will be glad enough to follow in the\r\nfootsteps of my victory.'\r\n\r\nAll this and much else of the same tenor Antonius poured out with        3\r\nflashing eyes, raising his voice so as to reach the centurions and\r\nsome of the soldiers, who had gathered round to share in their\r\ndeliberations.[12] His truculent tone carried away even the more\r\ncautious and far-seeing, while the rest of the crowd were filled with\r\ncontempt for the cowardice of the other generals, and cheered their\r\none and only leader to the echo. He had already established his\r\nreputation at the original meeting, when Vespasian's letter[13] was\r\nread. Most of the generals had then taken an ambiguous line, intending\r\nto interpret their language in the light of subsequent events. But\r\nAntonius seemed to have taken the field without any disguise, and this\r\ncarried more weight with the men, who saw that he must share their\r\ndisgrace or their glory.\r\n\r\nNext to Antonius in influence stood Cornelius Fuscus, the imperial       4\r\nagent.[14] He, too, always attacked Vitellius in no mild terms, and\r\nhad left himself no hope in case of failure. Tampius Flavianus[15] was\r\na man whose disposition and advanced years inclined him to dilatory\r\nmeasures, and he soon began to earn the dislike and suspicion of the\r\nsoldiers, who felt he had not forgotten his kinship with Vitellius.\r\nBesides this, when the legions first rose, he had fled to Italy and\r\nsubsequently returned of his own free will, which looked like\r\nmeditating treachery.[16] Having once given up his province and\r\nreturned to Italy, he was out of the reach of danger, but the passion\r\nfor revolution had induced him to resume his title and meddle in the\r\ncivil war. It was Cornelius Fuscus who had persuaded him to this--not\r\nthat he needed his assistance, but because he felt that, especially at\r\nthe outset of the rising, the prestige of an ex-consul would be a\r\nvaluable asset to the party.\r\n\r\nIn order to make their march across into Italy safe and effective,       5\r\nletters were sent to Aponius Saturninus[17] to bring the Moesian army\r\nup as quickly as possible. To prevent the exposure of the defenceless\r\nprovinces to the attacks of foreign tribes, the chiefs of the\r\nSarmatian Iazyges,[18] who formed the government of the tribe, were\r\nenlisted in the service. They also offered their tribal force,\r\nconsisting entirely of cavalry, but were excused from this\r\ncontribution for fear that the civil war might give opportunity for a\r\nforeign invasion, or that an offer of higher pay from the enemy might\r\ntempt them to sacrifice their duty and their honour.[19] Sido and\r\nItalicus, two princes of the Suebi,[20] were allowed to join\r\nVespasian's side. They had long acknowledged Roman sovereignty, and\r\ncompanionship in arms[21] was likely to strengthen the loyalty of the\r\ntribe. Some auxiliaries were stationed on the flank towards Raetia,\r\nwhere hostilities were expected, since the imperial agent Porcius\r\nSeptiminus,[22] remained incorruptibly loyal to Vitellius. Sextilius\r\nFelix was therefore dispatched with Aurius' Horse[23] and eight\r\ncohorts of auxiliary infantry, together with the native levies of\r\nNoricum, to hold the line of the river Aenus,[24] which forms the\r\nfrontier of Raetia and Noricum. Neither side provoked a battle: the\r\nfortune of the rival parties was decided elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the head of a picked band of auxiliaries and part of       6\r\nthe cavalry, Antonius hurried off to invade Italy. He took with him an\r\nenergetic soldier named Arrius Varus, who had made his reputation\r\nwhile serving under Corbulo in his Armenian victories. He was supposed\r\nto have sought a private interview with Nero, at which he maligned\r\nCorbulo's character. His infamous treachery brought him the emperor's\r\nfavour and a post as senior centurion. This ill-gotten prize delighted\r\nhim now, but ultimately proved his ruin.[25]\r\n\r\nAfter occupying Aquileia,[26] Antonius and Varus found a ready welcome\r\nat Opitergium and Altinum[27] and all the other towns in the\r\nneighbourhood. At Altinum a garrison was left behind to guard their\r\ncommunications against the fleet at Ravenna, for the news of its\r\ndesertion had not as yet arrived. Pressing forward, they won Patavium\r\nand Ateste[28] for the party. At the latter place they learnt that\r\nthree cohorts of Vitellius' auxiliary infantry and a regiment of\r\ncavalry, known as Sebosus' Horse,[29] were established at Forum\r\nAlieni,[30] where they had constructed a bridge.[31] The report added\r\nthat they were off their guard, so this seemed a good opportunity to\r\nattack them. They accordingly rushed the position at dawn, and cut\r\ndown many of the men without their weapons. Orders had been given\r\nthat, after a few had been killed, the rest should be terrorized into\r\ndesertion. Some surrendered at once, but the majority succeeded in\r\ndestroying the bridge, and thus checked the enemy's pursuit. The first\r\nbout had gone in the Flavians' favour.\r\n\r\nWhen the news spread to Poetovio, the Seventh Galbian and the            7\r\nThirteenth Gemina hurried in high spirits to Patavium under the\r\ncommand of Vedius Aquila. At Patavium they were given a few days'\r\nrest, during which Minicius Justus, the camp-prefect of the Seventh\r\nlegion, who endeavoured to enforce a standard of discipline too severe\r\nfor civil war, had to be rescued from the fury of his troops and sent\r\nto Vespasian. Antonius conceived that his party would gain in\r\nprestige, if they showed approval of Galba's government, and stood for\r\nthe revival of his cause. So he gave orders that all the statues of\r\nGalba, which had been thrown down during the civil war, should be\r\nreplaced for worship throughout the country towns. This was a thing\r\nthat had long been desired, and in their ambitious imaginations it\r\nassumed an undue importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question then arose where they should choose their seat of war.      8\r\nThe best place seemed to be Verona. The open country round it was\r\nsuited for the manoeuvres of the cavalry, in which their strength\r\nlay: and they would gain both prestige and profit by wresting from\r\nVitellius a strongly garrisoned town. On the road they occupied\r\nVicetia.[32] In itself this was a very small matter, since there was\r\nonly a moderate force in the town, but it gained considerable\r\nimportance from the reflection that it was Caecina's birthplace: the\r\nenemy's general had thus lost his native town. But Verona was well\r\nworth while. The inhabitants could aid the party with encouragement\r\nand funds: the army was thrust midway between Raetia and the Julian\r\nAlps,[33] and had thus blocked all passages by that route for the\r\nGerman armies.\r\n\r\nThis move had been made either without the knowledge or against the\r\norders of Vespasian. His instructions were to suspend operations at\r\nAquileia and wait for the arrival of Mucianus. He had further added\r\nthis consideration, that so long as he held Egypt and the key to the\r\ncorn-supply,[34] as well as the revenue of the richest provinces,[35]\r\nhe could reduce Vitellius' army to submission from sheer lack of money\r\nand provisions. Mucianus had sent letter after letter with the same\r\nadvice, pointing to the prospect of a victory without bloodshed or\r\nbereavement, and using other similar pretexts to conceal his real\r\nmotive. This was ambition. He wanted to keep all the glory of the war\r\nto himself. However, the distance was so great that events outran his\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nAntonius accordingly made a sudden sally against the enemy's             9\r\noutposts, and after a slight skirmish, in which they tested each\r\nother's temper, both sides withdrew without advantage. Soon after,\r\nCaecina entrenched a strong position between a Veronese village called\r\nHostilia[36] and the marshes of the river Tartaro. Here he was safe,\r\nwith the river in his rear and the marsh to guard his flanks. Had he\r\nadded loyalty to his other advantages, he might have employed the full\r\nstrength of the Vitellian forces to crush the enemy's two legions,\r\nbefore they were reinforced by the Moesian army, or, at least, have\r\nforced them to retire in ignominious flight and abandon Italy. But\r\nCaecina used various pretexts for delay, and at the outset of the war\r\ntreacherously yielded all his advantages to the enemy. While it was\r\nopen to him to rout them by force of arms, he preferred to pester them\r\nwith letters and to wait until his intermediaries had settled the\r\nterms of his treason. In the meantime, Aponius Saturninus arrived with\r\nthe Seventh Claudian legion,[37] commanded by the tribune[38]\r\nVipstanus Messala, a distinguished member of a famous family, and the\r\nonly man who brought any honesty to this war.[39] To these forces,\r\nstill only three legions and no match for the Vitellians, Caecina\r\naddressed his letters. He criticized their rash attempt to sustain a\r\nlost cause, and at the same time praised the courage of the German\r\narmy in the highest terms. His allusions to Vitellius were few and\r\ncasual, and he refrained from insulting Vespasian. In fact he used no\r\nlanguage calculated either to seduce or to terrorize the enemy. The\r\nFlavian generals made no attempt to explain away their former defeat.\r\nThey proudly championed Vespasian, showing their loyalty to the cause,\r\ntheir confidence in the army, and their hostile prejudice[40] against\r\nVitellius. To the tribunes and centurions they held out the hope of\r\nretaining all the favours they had won from Vitellius, and they urged\r\nCaecina himself in plain terms to desert. These letters were both\r\nread before a meeting of the Flavian army, and served to increase\r\ntheir confidence, for while Caecina wrote mildly and seemed afraid of\r\noffending Vespasian, their own generals had answered contemptuously\r\nand scoffed at Vitellius.\r\n\r\nWhen the two other legions arrived, the Third[41] commanded by          10\r\nDillius Aponianus, and the Eighth by Numisius Lupus, Antonius decided\r\nto entrench Verona and make a demonstration in force. It so happened\r\nthat the Galbian legion, who had been told off to work in the trenches\r\nfacing the enemy, catching sight of some of their allies' cavalry in\r\nthe distance, took them for the enemy, and fell into a groundless\r\npanic. Suspecting treachery, they seized their arms and visited their\r\nfury on Tampius Flavianus.[42] They could prove no charge against him,\r\nbut he had long been unpopular, and a blind impulse made them clamour\r\nfor his head. He was Vitellius' kinsman, they howled; he had betrayed\r\nOtho; he had embezzled their donative. They would listen to no\r\ndefence, although he implored them with outstretched hands, grovelling\r\nfor the most part flat upon the ground, his clothes all torn, his face\r\nand chest shaken with sobs. This only served to inflame the soldiers'\r\nanger. His very excess of terror seemed to prove his guilt.\r\nAponius[43] tried to address them, but his voice was drowned in their\r\nshouts. The others, too, were contemptuously howled down. They would\r\ngive no one a hearing except Antonius, who had the power of authority\r\nas well as the arts of eloquence necessary to quiet a mob. When the\r\nriot grew worse, and they began to pass from insulting speeches to\r\nmurderous violence, he gave orders that Flavianus should be put in\r\nchains. Feeling that this was a farce,[44] the soldiers broke through\r\nthe guards round the general's quarters, prepared to resort to\r\nextremities. Whereupon Antonius, drawing his sword, bared his breast\r\nand vowed that he would die either by their hands or his own. Whenever\r\nhe saw a soldier whom he knew or could recognize by his decorations,\r\nhe called on him by name to come to the rescue. At last he turned\r\ntowards the standards and the gods of war,[45] and prayed incessantly\r\nthat they would rather inspire the enemy's army with this mad spirit\r\nof mutiny. At last the riot died away and at nightfall they all\r\ndispersed to their tents. Flavianus left that same night, and on his\r\nway met letters from Vespasian, which delivered him from danger.\r\n\r\nThe infection seemed to spread among the legions. They next             11\r\nattacked Aponius Saturninus, who was in command of the Moesian army.\r\nThis fresh disturbance was caused by the circulation of a letter,\r\nwhich Saturninus was supposed to have written to Vitellius, and it was\r\nthe more alarming since it broke out not when they were tired by their\r\nlabours but in the middle of the day. Once the soldiers had vied with\r\neach other in courage and discipline: now they were rivals in ribaldry\r\nand riot. They were determined that the fury with which they denounced\r\nAponius should not fall short of their outcry against Flavianus. The\r\nMoesian legions remembered that they had helped the Pannonian army to\r\ntake their revenge; while the Pannonian troops, feeling that their\r\ncomrades' mutiny acquitted them of blame, were glad enough to repeat\r\nthe crime. They invaded the country house in which Saturninus was\r\nliving. He escaped, however, aided not so much by the efforts of\r\nAntonius, Aponianus, and Messala, who did everything in their power to\r\nrescue him, but rather by the security of his hiding-place, for he\r\nconcealed himself in the furnace of some disused baths. Eventually he\r\ngave up his lictors and retired to Patavium. The departure of both the\r\nconsular governors left Antonius in supreme command of the two armies.\r\nHis colleagues[46] deferred to him and the men gave him enthusiastic\r\nsupport. It was even supposed by some that he had cunningly promoted\r\nboth outbreaks, to secure for himself the full profit of the war.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n      [1] Petau.\r\n\r\n      [2] i.e. the detachments 8,000 strong from the army in\r\n          Britain (see ii. 57).\r\n\r\n      [3] i.e. still, after parting with the force which he had\r\n          sent forward under Mucianus (see ii. 82, 83).\r\n\r\n      [4] Of Pontus, Syria, and Egypt.\r\n\r\n      [5] See ii. 86.\r\n\r\n      [6] Of Misenum and Ravenna.\r\n\r\n      [7] Adriatic.\r\n\r\n      [8] See ii. 42.\r\n\r\n      [9] At Bedriacum.\r\n\r\n     [10] See ii. 41.\r\n\r\n     [11] i.e. not yet declared finally against Vitellius.\r\n\r\n     [12] These were usually confined to the legates,\r\n          camp-prefects, tribunes, and senior centurions.\r\n\r\n     [13] See ii. 82.\r\n\r\n     [14] In Pannonia (see ii. 86).\r\n\r\n     [15] Military governor of Pannonia (see ii. 86).\r\n\r\n     [16] i.e. they suspected that he wanted to alienate the\r\n          troops from Vespasian.\r\n\r\n     [17] Military governor of Moesia (see i. 79, &c.).\r\n\r\n     [18] They occupied part of Hungary between the Danube and the\r\n          Theiss.\r\n\r\n     [19] They took the chiefs as a pledge of peace and kept them\r\n          safely apart from their tribal force.\r\n\r\n     [20] Tiberius' son, Drusus, had in A.D. 19 settled the Suebi\r\n          north of the Danube between the rivers March and Waag.\r\n\r\n     [21] Reading _commilitio_ (Meiser).

He is one of the\r\n          characters in the _Dialogue on Oratory_, and many passages\r\n          show that Tacitus admired him greatly, both for his character\r\n          and his eloquence.\r\n\r\n     [40] The text here is doubtful. There seems to be no exact\r\n          parallel to the absolute use of _praesumpsere_. In the\r\n          Medicean MS. the whole passage, from _revirescere_ at the end\r\n          of chap. 7 down to _inimici_ here, has been transposed to the\r\n          beginning of chap. 5, where it stands between the second and\r\n          third syllables of the word _Saturnino_. Thus in M.\r\n          _praesumpsere_ stands immediately after _partes_. It is\r\n          possible that the word _partes_ may belong to this passage as\r\n          well as to the end of chap. 7. _Praesumpsere partes_ would\r\n          mean 'they took their own cause for granted' (cp. Quintilian\r\n          xi. 1. 27). The addition of _ut inimici_ would add the sense\r\n          of 'hostile prejudice'.\r\n\r\n     [41] Gallica.\r\n\r\n     [42] See chap. 4, note 15.\r\n\r\n     [43] Saturninus.\r\n\r\n     [44] We have seen this trick before (cp. i. 45).\r\n\r\n     [45] Mars, Bellona, Victoria, Pavor, &c., whose images were\r\n          wrought in medallion on the shafts of the standards, which\r\n          themselves too were held sacred.\r\n\r\n     [46] i.e. Vedius, Dillius, Numisius, Vipstanus Messala.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISSENSION IN VITELLIUS' CAMP\r\n\r\n[47]Vitellius' party was equally a prey to disquiet, and there the      12\r\ndissension was the more fatal, since it was aroused not by the men's\r\nsuspicions but by the treachery of the generals. The sailors of the\r\nfleet at Ravenna were mostly drawn from the provinces of Dalmatia and\r\nPannonia, which were both held for Vespasian, and while they were\r\nstill wavering, the admiral, Lucilius Bassus, decided them in favour\r\nof the Flavian party. Choosing the night-time for their treason, the\r\nconspirators assembled at head-quarters without the knowledge of the\r\nother sailors. Bassus, who was either ashamed or uncertain of their\r\nsuccess, awaited developments in his house. Amid great disturbance the\r\nships' captains attacked the images of Vitellius and cut down the few\r\nmen who offered any resistance. The rest of the fleet were glad enough\r\nof a change, and their sympathies soon came round to Vespasian. Then\r\nLucilius appeared and publicly claimed responsibility. The fleet\r\nappointed Cornelius Fuscus[48] as their admiral, and he came hurrying\r\non to the scene. Bassus was put under honourable arrest and conveyed\r\nwith an escort of Liburnian cruisers[49] to Atria,[50] where he was\r\nimprisoned by Vibennius Rufinus, who commanded a regiment of auxiliary\r\nhorse in garrison there. However, he was soon set free on the\r\nintervention of Hormus, one of the emperor's freedmen. For he, too,\r\nranked as a general.\r\n\r\nWhen the news that the navy had gone over became known, Caecina,        13\r\ncarefully selecting a moment when the camp was deserted, and the men\r\nhad all gone to their various duties, summoned to head-quarters the\r\nsenior centurions and a few of the soldiers. He then proceeded to\r\npraise the spirit and the strength of Vespasian's party: 'they\r\nthemselves had been deserted by the fleet; they were cramped for\r\nsupplies; Spain and Gaul were against them; Rome could not be\r\ntrusted.' In every way he exaggerated the weakness of Vitellius'\r\nposition. Eventually, when some of his accomplices had given the cue\r\nand the rest were dumbfoundered by his change of front, he made them\r\nall swear allegiance to Vespasian. Immediately the portraits[51] of\r\nVitellius were torn down and messengers dispatched to Antonius.\r\nHowever, when the treason got abroad in the camp, and the men\r\nreturning to head-quarters saw Vespasian's name on the standards and\r\nVitellius' portraits scattered on the ground, at first there was an\r\nominous silence: then with one voice they all vented their feelings.\r\nHad the pride of the German army sunk so low that without a battle and\r\nwithout a blow they should let their hands be shackled and render up\r\ntheir arms? What had they against them? None but defeated troops. The\r\nonly sound legions of Otho's army, the First and the Fourteenth,\r\nVespasian had not got, and even those they had routed and cut to\r\npieces on that same field. And all for what? That these thousands of\r\nfighting men should be handed over like a drove of slaves to Antonius,\r\nthe convict![52] 'Eight legions, forsooth, are to follow the lead of\r\none miserable fleet. Such is the pleasure of Bassus and Caecina. They\r\nhave robbed the emperor of his home, his estate, and all his wealth,\r\nand now they want to take away his troops. We have never lost a man\r\nnor shed a drop of blood. The very Flavians will despise us. What\r\nanswer can we give when they question us about our victory or our\r\ndefeat?'\r\n\r\nThus they shouted one and all as their indignation urged them. Led      14\r\nby the Fifth legion, they replaced the portraits of Vitellius and put\r\nCaecina in irons. They selected Fabius Fabullus, commanding the Fifth\r\nlegion, and the camp-prefect, Cassius Longus, to lead them. Some\r\nmarines who arrived at this point from three Liburnian cruisers,[53]\r\nquite innocent and unaware of what had happened, were promptly\r\nbutchered. Then the men deserted their camp, broke down the\r\nbridge,[54] and marched back to Hostilia, and thence to Cremona to\r\njoin the two legions, the First Italian and Twenty-first Rapax, which\r\nCaecina had sent ahead[55] with some of the cavalry to occupy Cremona.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [47] The narrative is now resumed from the end of Book II.\r\n\r\n     [48] See ii. 86.\r\n\r\n     [49] See ii. 16, note 247.\r\n\r\n     [50] Atri.\r\n\r\n     [51] i.e. the medallions on the standards.\r\n\r\n     [52] See ii. 86.\r\n\r\n     [53] See ii. 16, note 247.\r\n\r\n     [54] Over the Tartaro (chap. 9).\r\n\r\n     [55] See ii. 100.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGAGEMENT NEAR CREMONA\r\n\r\nWhen Antonius heard of this he determined to attack the enemy           15\r\nwhile they were still at variance and their forces divided. The\r\nVitellian generals would soon recover their authority and the troops\r\ntheir discipline, and confidence would come if the two divisions were\r\nallowed to join. He guessed also that Fabius Valens had already\r\nstarted from Rome and would hasten his march when he heard of\r\nCaecina's treachery. Valens was loyal to Vitellius and an experienced\r\nsoldier. There was good reason, besides, to fear an attack on the side\r\nof Raetia from an immense force of German irregulars. Vitellius had\r\nalready summoned auxiliaries from Britain, Gaul, and Spain in\r\nsufficient numbers to blight their chances utterly, had not Antonius\r\nin fear of this very prospect forestalled the victory by hurriedly\r\nforcing an engagement. In two days he marched his whole force from\r\nVerona to Bedriacum.[56] On the next day[57] he left his legions\r\nbehind to fortify the camp, and sent out his auxiliary infantry into\r\nterritory belonging to Cremona, to taste the joys of plundering their\r\ncompatriots under pretext of collecting supplies. To secure greater\r\nfreedom for their depredations, he himself advanced at the head of\r\nfour thousand cavalry eight miles along the road from Bedriacum. The\r\nscouts, as is usual, turned their attention further afield.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven in the morning a mounted scout galloped up with the        16\r\nnews that the enemy were at hand; there was a small body in advance of\r\nthe rest, but the noise of an army in movement could be heard over the\r\ncountry-side. While Antonius was debating what he ought to do, Arrius\r\nVarus, who was greedy to distinguish himself, galloped out with the\r\nkeenest of the troopers and charged the Vitellians, inflicting only\r\nslight loss; for, on the arrival of reinforcements, the tables were\r\nturned and those who had been hottest in pursuit were now hindmost in\r\nthe rout. Their haste had no sanction from Antonius, who had foreseen\r\nwhat would happen. Encouraging his men to engage with brave hearts, he\r\ndrew off the cavalry on to each flank and left a free passage in the\r\ncentre to receive Varus and his troopers. Orders were sent to the\r\nlegions to arm and signals were displayed to the foraging party,\r\nsummoning them to cease plundering and join the battle by the quickest\r\npossible path. Meanwhile Varus came plunging in terror into the middle\r\nof their ranks, spreading confusion among them. The fresh troops were\r\nswept back along with the wounded, themselves sharing the panic and\r\nsorely embarrassed by the narrowness of the road.\r\n\r\nIn all the confusion of the rout Antonius never for a moment            17\r\nforgot what befitted a determined general and a brave soldier. Staying\r\nthe panic-stricken, checking the fugitives, wherever the fight was\r\nthickest, wherever he saw a gleam of hope, he schemed, he fought, he\r\nshouted, always conspicuous to his own men and a mark for the enemy.\r\nAt last, in the heat of his impatience, he thrust through with a lance\r\na standard-bearer, who was in full flight, then seized the standard\r\nand turned it against the enemy. Whereupon for very shame a few of his\r\ntroopers, not more than a hundred, made a stand. The nature of the\r\nground helped them. The road there was narrower; a stream barred their\r\nway, and the bridge was broken; its depth was uncertain and the steep\r\nbanks checked their flight. Thus necessity or chance restored their\r\nfallen fortunes. Forming in close order, they received the\r\nVitellians' reckless and disordered charge, and at once flung them\r\ninto confusion. Antonius pressed hard on the fugitives and cut down\r\nall who blocked his path. The others followed each his inclination,\r\nrifling the dead, capturing prisoners, seizing arms and horses.\r\nMeanwhile, summoned by their shouts of triumph, those who had just now\r\nbeen in full flight across the fields came hurrying back to share the\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nFour miles from Cremona they saw the standards of the Rapax and         18\r\nItalian legions gleaming in the sun. They had marched out thus far\r\nunder cover of their cavalry's original success. When fortune turned\r\nagainst them, they neither opened their ranks to receive the routed\r\ntroops nor marched out to attack the enemy, who were wearied with\r\nfighting and their long pursuit. While all went well the Vitellians\r\ndid not miss their general, but in the hour of danger they realized\r\ntheir loss. The victorious cavalry came charging into their wavering\r\nline, and at the same time Vipstanus Messala arrived with the Moesian\r\nauxiliaries and a good number of men from the legions, who had kept up\r\nwith the pace of their forced march.[58] These combined forces broke\r\nthe opposing column, and the proximity of Cremona's sheltering walls\r\ngave the Vitellians more hope of refuge and less stomach for\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [56] About thirty-three miles.\r\n\r\n     [57] October 27.\r\n\r\n     [58] They would be more heavily laden than the Moesian\r\n          auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF CREMONA\r\n\r\nAntonius did not follow up his advantage. He realized that, although\r\nthe issue had been successful, the battle had long been doubtful, and\r\nhad cost the troopers and their horses many wounds and much hard\r\nfighting. As evening fell, the whole strength of the Flavian army       19\r\narrived. They had marched among heaps of corpses, and the still\r\nreeking traces of slaughter, and now, feeling that the war was over,\r\nthey clamoured to advance at once on Cremona and either receive its\r\nsubmission or take it by storm. This sounded well for public\r\nutterance, but each man in his heart was thinking, 'We could easily\r\nrush a city on the plain. In a night-assault men are just as brave and\r\nhave a better chance of plunder. If we wait for day it will be all\r\npeace and petitions, and what shall we get for our wounds and our\r\nlabours? A reputation for mercy! There's no money in that. All the\r\nwealth of Cremona will find its way into the officers' pockets. Storm\r\na city, and the plunder goes to the soldiers: if it surrenders, the\r\ngenerals get it.' They refused to listen to their centurions and\r\ntribunes and drowned their voices in a rattle of arms, swearing they\r\nwould break their orders unless they were led out. Antonius then        20\r\nwent round among the companies, where his authoritative bearing\r\nobtained silence. He assured them that he had no wish to rob them of\r\nthe glory and the reward they so well deserved. 'But,' he said, 'an\r\narmy and a general have different functions. It is right that soldiers\r\nshould be greedy for battle, but the general often does more good not\r\nby temerity but by foresight, deliberation and delay. I have done all\r\nI could to aid your victory with my sword: now I will serve you by the\r\ngeneral's proper arts of calculation and strategy. The risks that face\r\nus are obvious. It is night; we know nothing of the lie of the city;\r\nthe enemy are behind the walls; everything favours an ambush. Even if\r\nthe gates were open, we cannot safely enter except by day and after\r\ndue reconnoitring. Are you going to begin storming the town when you\r\ncannot possibly see where the ground is level and how high the walls\r\nare? How do you know whether to assault it with engines and showers of\r\nmissiles, or with penthouses and shelters?'[59] Then he turned to\r\nindividuals, asking one after another whether they had brought\r\nhatchets and pick-axes and other implements for storming a town. When\r\nthey answered no, 'Well,' he said, 'could any troops possibly break\r\nthrough walls or undermine them with nothing but swords and javelins?\r\nSuppose it proves necessary to construct a mound and to shelter\r\nourselves with mantlets and fascines,[59] are we going to stand idle\r\nlike a lot of helpless idiots, gaping at the height of the enemy's\r\ntowers and ramparts? Why not rather wait one night till our\r\nsiege-train arrives and then carry the victory by force?' So saying,\r\nhe sent the camp-followers and servants with the freshest of the\r\ntroopers back to Bedriacum to bring up supplies and whatever else was\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers indeed chafed at this and mutiny seemed imminent,          21\r\nwhen some of the mounted scouts, who had ridden right up to the walls,\r\ncaptured a few stragglers from Cremona, and learnt from them that six\r\nVitellian legions and the whole Hostilia army had that very day\r\ncovered thirty miles, and, hearing of their comrades' defeat, were\r\nalready arming for battle and would be on them immediately. This\r\nalarming news cured their obstinate deafness to the general's advice.\r\nHe ordered the Thirteenth legion to take up their position on the\r\nraised Postumian high-road. In touch with them on the left wing in the\r\nopen country were the Seventh Galbian, beside whom stood the Seventh\r\nClaudian, so placed that their front was protected by a ditch. On the\r\nright wing were the Eighth, drawn up along an open cross-road, and\r\nnext to them the Third, distributed among some thick clumps of trees.\r\nSuch, at any rate, was the order of the eagles and standards. In the\r\ndarkness the soldiers were confused and took their places at random.\r\nThe band of Guards[60] was next to the Third, and the auxiliaries on\r\nthe wings, while the cavalry were disposed in support round the flanks\r\nand the rear. Sido and Italicus with their picked band of Suebi[61]\r\nfought in the front line.\r\n\r\nFor the Vitellians the right course was to rest at Cremona and          22\r\nrecuperate their strength with food and a night's rest, and then on\r\nthe next day to crush and rout the Flavians when they were stiff with\r\ncold and weak from hunger. But they had no general;[62] they had no\r\nplan. Though it was nearly nine at night they flung themselves upon\r\nthe Flavians, who were standing steady in their places to receive\r\nthem. In their fury and the darkness the Vitellian line was so\r\ndisordered that one can hardly venture to describe the disposition of\r\ntheir troops. However, it has been stated that the Fourth Macedonian\r\nlegion were on the right flank; in the centre were the Fifth and\r\nFifteenth with the detachments of the Ninth, the Second and the\r\nTwentieth from Britain; the Sixteenth, the Twenty-second, and the\r\nFirst formed the left wing. The men of the Rapax and Italian\r\nlegions[63] were distributed among all the companies.[64] The cavalry\r\nand auxiliaries picked their own position. All night the battle raged\r\nwith varying fortune, never decided, always savagely contested.\r\nDisaster threatened now one side, now the other. Courage, strength\r\nwere of little use: their eyes could not even see in front of them.\r\nBoth sides were armed alike; the watchwords, constantly demanded, soon\r\nbecame known; the standards were all in confusion, as they were\r\ncaptured and carried off from one band to another. The Seventh legion,\r\nraised recently by Galba, suffered most severely. Six of the senior\r\ncenturions fell and several standards were lost. They nearly lost\r\ntheir eagle too, but it was rescued by the bravery of the senior\r\ncenturion, named Atilius Verus, who after great slaughter of the enemy\r\nfell finally himself.\r\n\r\nAntonius had meanwhile called up the Guards to reinforce his            23\r\nwavering line. Taking up the fight, they repulsed the enemy, only to\r\nbe repulsed in their turn. For the Vitellian artillery, which had at\r\nfirst been scattered all along the line, and had been discharged upon\r\nthe bushes without hurting the enemy, was now massed upon the\r\nhigh-road, and swept the open space in front. One immense engine in\r\nparticular, which belonged to the Fifteenth, mowed down the Flavian\r\nline with huge stones. The slaughter thus caused would have been\r\nenormous, had not two of the Flavian soldiers performed a memorable\r\nexploit. Concealing their identity by snatching up shields from among\r\nthe enemy's dead,[65] they cut the ropes which suspended the weights\r\nof the engine. They fell immediately, riddled with wounds, and so\r\ntheir names have perished. But of their deed there is no doubt.\r\n\r\nFortune had favoured neither side when, as the night wore on, the moon\r\nrose and threw a deceptive glamour over the field of battle. Shining\r\nfrom behind the Flavians the moon was in their favour. It magnified\r\nthe shadows of their men and horses so that the enemy took the shadow\r\nfor the substance, and their missiles were misdirected and fell\r\nshort. The Vitellians, on the other hand, had the moon shining full on\r\nthem and were an easy mark for the Flavians, shooting as it were out\r\nof cover.[66]\r\n\r\nThus being enabled to recognize his own men, and to be recognized       24\r\nby them, Antonius appealed to some by taunting their honour, to many\r\nby words of praise and encouragement, to all by promising hope of\r\nreward. He asked the Pannonian legions why they had drawn their swords\r\nagain. Here on this field they could regain their glory and wipe out\r\nthe stain of their former disgrace.[67] Then turning to the Moesian\r\ntroops, who were the chief promoters of the war,[68] he told them it\r\nwas no good challenging the Vitellians with verbal threats, if they\r\ncould not bear to face them and their blows. Thus he addressed each\r\nlegion as he reached it. To the Third he spoke at greater length,\r\nreminding them of their victories both old and new. Had they not under\r\nMark Antony defeated the Parthians[69] and the Armenians under\r\nCorbulo?[70] Had they not but lately crushed the Sarmatians?[71] Then\r\nhe turned in fury on the Guards. 'Peasants that you are,' he shouted,\r\n'have you another emperor, another camp waiting to shelter you, if you\r\nare defeated? There in the enemy's line are your standards and your\r\narms: defeat means death and--no, you have drained disgrace already to\r\nthe dregs.'\r\n\r\nThese words roused cheers on all sides, and the Third, following the\r\nSyrian custom,[72] saluted the rising sun. Thus arose a casual          25\r\nrumour--or possibly it was suggested by the general's ingenuity--that\r\nMucianus had arrived, and that the two armies were cheering each\r\nother. On they pressed, feeling they had been reinforced. The\r\nVitellian line was more ragged now, for, having no general to marshal\r\nthem, their ranks now filled, now thinned, with each alternation of\r\ncourage and fear. As soon as Antonius saw them waver, he kept\r\nthrusting at them in massed column. The line bent and then broke, and\r\nthe inextricable confusion of wagons and siege-engines prevented their\r\nrallying. The victorious troops scattered along the cross-road in\r\nheadlong pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe slaughter was marked by one peculiar horror. A son killed his\r\nfather. I give the facts and names on the authority of Vipstanus\r\nMessala.[73] One Julius Mansuetus, a Spaniard who had joined the\r\nlegion Rapax, had left a young son at home. This boy subsequently grew\r\nup and enlisted in the Seventh legion, raised by Galba.[74] Chance now\r\nsent his father in his way, and he felled him to the ground. While he\r\nwas ransacking the dying man, they recognized each other. Flinging his\r\narms round the now lifeless corpse, in a piteous voice he implored\r\nhis father's spirit to be appeased and not to turn against him as a\r\nparricide. The crime was his country's, he cried; what share had a\r\nsingle soldier in these civil wars? Meanwhile he lifted the body and\r\nbegan to dig a grave and perform the last rites for his father. Those\r\nwho were nearest noticed this; then the story began to spread, till\r\nthere ran through the army astonishment and many complaints and curses\r\nagainst this wicked war. Yet they never ceased busily killing and\r\nplundering friends and relatives and brothers; and while they talked\r\nof the crime they were committing it themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Cremona a fresh task of vast difficulty awaited       26\r\nthem. During the war with Otho[75] the German army had entrenched\r\ntheir camp round the walls of Cremona and then erected a rampart round\r\nthe camp; and these fortifications had been further strengthened. The\r\nsight of them brought the victors to a halt, and their generals were\r\nuncertain what instructions to give. The troops had had no rest for a\r\nday and a night. To storm the town at once would be an arduous and, in\r\nthe absence of reserves, a perilous task. On the other hand, a retreat\r\nto Bedriacum would involve the intolerable fatigue of a long march,\r\nand destroy the value of their victory. Again, it would be dangerous\r\nto entrench themselves so close to the lines of the enemy, who might\r\nat any minute sally forth and rout them while they were dispersed and\r\ndigging trenches. The chief anxiety lay in the temper of the men, who\r\nwere much more ready to face danger than delay. To them discretion was\r\ndisagreeable and hazard spelt hope. Their thirst for plunder\r\noutweighed all fears of wounds and bloodshed.\r\n\r\nAntonius also inclined to this view and gave orders for them to         27\r\nsurround the rampart. At first they stood back and delivered volleys\r\nof arrows and stones, suffering themselves the severer loss, for a\r\nstorm of missiles rained down from the walls. Antonius then told off\r\neach legion to assault a different point of the rampart or one of the\r\ngates, hoping that by thus separating them he could distinguish the\r\ncowards from the brave and inflame them with a spirit of honourable\r\nrivalry. The Third and Seventh took the position nearest the road to\r\nBedriacum; the Eighth and Seventh Claudian assaulted the right-hand\r\nside of the rampart; the Thirteenth swept up to the Brixian Gate.[76]\r\nA brief delay was caused while some fetched mattocks and pickaxes from\r\nthe fields, and others hooks and ladders. Then holding their shields\r\nabove their heads in close 'tortoise' formation,[77] they advanced\r\nunder the rampart. Both sides employed Roman tactics. The Vitellians\r\nrolled down huge masses of stones, and, as the sheltering cover of\r\nshields parted and wavered, they thrust at it with lances and poles,\r\nuntil at last the whole structure was broken up and they mowed down\r\nthe torn and bleeding soldiers beneath with terrible slaughter.\r\n\r\nThe men would certainly have hesitated, had not the generals,\r\nrealizing that they were really too tired to respond to any other form\r\nof encouragement, pointed significantly to Cremona. Whether this        28\r\nwas Hormus's idea, as Messala[78] records, or whether we should rather\r\nfollow Caius Pliny, who accuses Antonius, it is not easy to determine.\r\nThis one may say, that, however abominable the crime, yet in\r\ncommitting it neither Antonius nor Hormus belied the reputation of\r\ntheir lives. After this neither wounds nor bloodshed could stay the\r\nFlavian troops. They demolished the rampart, shook the gates, climbed\r\nup on each other's shoulders, or over the re-formed 'tortoise', and\r\nsnatched away the enemy's weapons or caught hold of them by the arms.\r\nThus the wounded and unwounded, the half-dead and the dying, all came\r\nrolling down and perished together by every imaginable kind of death.\r\n\r\nThe fight raged thickest round the Third and Seventh legions, and       29\r\nthe general, Antonius, came up with a picked band of auxiliaries to\r\nsupport their assault. The Vitellians, finding themselves unable to\r\nresist the attack of troops thus stubbornly vying with each other, and\r\nseeing their missiles all glide off the shelter of shields, at last\r\nsent their engine of war crashing down upon their heads. For the\r\nmoment it scattered and crushed beneath it the men on whom it fell,\r\nbut it dragged with it some of the battlements and the top of the\r\nrampart. At the same moment one of the towers on the rampart gave way\r\nunder a shower of stones. While the men of the Seventh struggled up to\r\nthe breach in close column,[79] the Third hewed down the gate with\r\nhatchets and swords. All the authorities[80] agree that Caius Volusius\r\nof the Third legion was the first man in. Emerging on the top of the\r\nrampart, he hurled down those who barred his path, and from this\r\nconspicuous position waved his hand and shouted that the camp was\r\ntaken. The others poured through, while the Vitellians in panic flung\r\nthemselves down from the rampart, and the whole space between the camp\r\nand the walls became a seething scene of carnage.\r\n\r\nHere, again, was a new type of task for the Flavians. Here were         30\r\nhigh walls, stone battlements, iron-barred gates, and soldiers hurling\r\njavelins. The citizens of Cremona were numerous and devoted to the\r\ncause of Vitellius, and half Italy had gathered there for the Fair\r\nwhich fell just at that time. Their numbers were a help to the\r\ndefenders, but the prospect of plundering them offered an incentive to\r\ntheir assailants. Antonius ordered his men to bring fire and apply it\r\nto the most beautiful of the buildings outside the walls, hoping that\r\nthe loss of their property might induce the citizens to turn traitor.\r\nThe houses that stood nearest to the walls and overtopped them he\r\ncrowded with his bravest troops, who dislodged the defenders with\r\nshowers of beams and tiles and flaming torches. Meanwhile, some of      31\r\nthe legionaries began to advance in 'tortoise' formation,[81] while\r\nothers kept up a steady fire of javelins and stones.\r\n\r\nGradually the spirit of the Vitellians ebbed. The higher their rank,\r\nthe more easily they gave way to misfortune. For they were afraid that\r\nif Cremona too[82] was demolished, there would be no hope of pardon;\r\nthe victors' fury would fall not on the common poor but on the\r\ntribunes and centurions, whom it would pay to kill. The common\r\nsoldiers felt safe in their obscurity, and, careless of the future,\r\ncontinued to offer resistance. They roamed the streets or hid\r\nthemselves in houses, and though they had given up the war, refused\r\neven so to sue for peace. Meanwhile the tribunes and centurions did\r\naway with the name and portraits of Vitellius.[83] They released\r\nCaecina, who was still in irons,[84] and begged his help in pleading\r\ntheir cause. When he turned from them in haughty contempt they\r\nbesought him with tears. It was, indeed, the last of evils that all\r\nthese brave men should invoke a traitor's aid. They then hung veils\r\nand fillets[85] out on the walls, and when Antonius had given the\r\norder to cease firing, they carried out their standards and eagles,\r\nfollowed by a miserable column of disarmed soldiers, dejectedly\r\nhanging their heads. The victors had at first crowded round, heaping\r\ninsults on them and threatening violence, but when they found that the\r\nvanquished had lost all their proud spirit, and turned their cheeks\r\nwith servile endurance to every indignity, they gradually began to\r\nrecollect that these were the men who had made such a moderate use of\r\ntheir victory at Bedriacum.[86] But when the crowd parted, and Caecina\r\nadvanced in his consular robes, attended by his lictors in full state,\r\ntheir indignation broke into flame. They charged him with insolence\r\nand cruelty, and--so hateful is crime--they even flung his treachery\r\nin his teeth.[87] Antonius restrained them and sent Caecina under\r\nescort to Vespasian.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the citizens of Cremona suffered sorely from the              32\r\nviolence of the troops, and only the entreaties of their generals\r\ncould withhold them from a general massacre. Antonius summoned a mass\r\nmeeting and delivered a eulogy upon his victorious army, promising\r\nmercy to the vanquished and speaking of Cremona in ambiguous terms.\r\nBesides their natural passion for plunder, there was an old grudge\r\nwhich urged them to sack Cremona. The town was believed to have given\r\nassistance to the Vitellian cause before this in the war with\r\nOtho;[88] and again, when the Thirteenth had been left behind to\r\nbuild an amphitheatre,[89] the populace had shown its town-bred\r\nimpertinence by assailing them with insolent ridicule. Other causes\r\nincreased this bad feeling: it was here that Caecina had given his\r\nshow of gladiators:[89] the town had become for a second time the\r\ntheatre of the war: the citizens had conveyed food to the Vitellians\r\nduring the battle: some women had been killed, whose enthusiasm for\r\nthe cause had led them to take part in the fight. Besides all this,\r\nthe Fair had filled the rich city with an even greater display of\r\nwealth than usual. All eyes were now centred on Antonius, whose fame\r\nand good fortune overshadowed all the other generals. It so happened\r\nthat he hurried off to the baths to wash off the stains of blood.\r\nFinding fault with the temperature of the water, he received the\r\nanswer, 'It will not be long before it is hot,' and this phrase was\r\ncaught up. The attendant's words were repeated, and brought all the\r\nodium on Antonius, who was thus believed to have given the signal to\r\nset fire to Cremona, which was already in flames.[90]\r\n\r\nThus forty thousand soldiers burst into the town with a yet larger      33\r\ncrowd of servants and sutlers, even more depraved than the soldiers in\r\ntheir readiness for cruelty and lust. Without any respect for age or\r\nfor authority they added rape to murder and murder to rape. Aged men\r\nand decrepit old women, who were worthless as booty, were hustled off\r\nto make sport for them. If some grown girl or a handsome youth fell\r\ninto their clutches, they would be torn to pieces in the struggle for\r\npossession, while the plunderers were left to cut each other's\r\nthroats. Whoever carried off money or any of the solid gold offerings\r\nin the temples was liable to be cut to pieces, if he met another\r\nstronger than himself. Some, disdaining easy finds, hunted for hidden\r\nhoards, and dug out buried treasure, flogging and torturing the\r\nhouseholders. They held torches in their hands and, having once\r\nsecured their prize, would fling them wantonly into an empty house or\r\nsome dismantled temple. Composed as the army was of citizens, allies,\r\nand foreign troops, differing widely in language and customs, the\r\nobjects of the soldiers' greed differed also. But while their views of\r\nwhat was right might vary, they all agreed in thinking nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nCremona lasted them four days. While all other buildings sacred and\r\nsecular sank in the flames, only the temple of Mefitis outside the\r\nwalls was left standing, saved either by its position or the power of\r\nthe presiding deity.[91]\r\n\r\nSuch was the end of Cremona two hundred and eighty-six years after      34\r\nits foundation. It had been originally built in the consulship of\r\nTiberius Sempronius and Publius Cornelius, while Hannibal was\r\nthreatening to invade Italy, to serve as a bulwark against the Gauls\r\nbeyond the Po,[92] and to resist any other power that might break in\r\nover the Alps. And so it grew and flourished, aided by its large\r\nnumber of settlers, its conveniently situated rivers,[93] the\r\nfertility of its territory, and its connexion through alliance and\r\nintermarriage with other communities. Foreign invasions had left it\r\nuntouched only to become the victim of civil war. Antonius, ashamed of\r\nhis crime, and realizing his growing disfavour, proclaimed that no\r\ncitizen of Cremona was to be kept as a prisoner of war; and, indeed,\r\nthe unanimous feeling in Italy against buying such slaves had already\r\nfrustrated the soldiers' hope of profit. So they began to kill their\r\ncaptives, whose relatives and friends, when this became known,\r\ncovertly bought their release. After a while, the rest of the\r\ninhabitants returned, and the squares and temples were rebuilt by the\r\nmunificence of the burghers and under Vespasian's direct patronage.\r\n\r\nHowever, the soil was so foully infected by the reek of blood that      35\r\nit was impossible for the Flavians to encamp for long on the ruins of\r\nthis buried city. They advanced along the road to the third milestone,\r\nand mustered the Vitellians, still straggling and panic-stricken, each\r\nunder his own standard. The defeated legions were then distributed\r\nthrough Illyricum, for the civil war was still in progress and their\r\nfidelity could not be relied on. They then dispatched couriers to\r\ncarry the news to Britain and the Spanish provinces. To Gaul they sent\r\nan officer named Julius Calenus, to Germany Alpinius Montanus, who had\r\ncommanded an auxiliary cohort. Montanus was a Treviran and Calenus an\r\nAeduan; both had fought for Vitellius and thus served to advertise\r\nVespasian's victory. At the same time garrisons were sent to hold the\r\npasses of the Alps, for fear that Germany might rise in support of\r\nVitellius.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [59] See ii. 21.\r\n\r\n     [60] i.e. the band of Otho's old Guards whom Vitellius had\r\n          disbanded and Vespasian re-enlisted (see ii. 67, 82).\r\n\r\n     [61] See chap. 5.\r\n\r\n     [62] Caecina was under arrest, Valens still on his way from\r\n          Rome (see chaps. 14, 15).\r\n\r\n     [63] XXI and I.\r\n\r\n     [64] Because they had already suffered heavy losses earlier\r\n          in the day (see chap. 18).\r\n\r\n     [65] These shields would have Vitellius' name on them, and\r\n          thus conceal their identity.\r\n\r\n     [66] Dio asserts that the moon was 'black and bloody, and\r\n          gave off other fearsome hues'.\r\n\r\n     [67] i.e. at the first battle of Bedriacum (see ii. 43).\r\n\r\n     [68] See ii. 85.\r\n\r\n     [69] 36 B.C.\r\n\r\n     [70] A.D. 63.\r\n\r\n     [71] i.e. the Rhoxolani (cp. i. 79).\r\n\r\n     [72] They had served recently in Syria under Corbulo (see above).\r\n\r\n     [73] An eyewitness (see note 39).\r\n\r\n     [74] In Spain.\r\n\r\n     [75] i.e. at the time of the first battle of Bedriacum in April.\r\n\r\n     [76] i.e. the gate giving on to the road to Brescia.\r\n\r\n     [77] In this famous formation the front-rank men kept close\r\n          together and covered their bodies with long, concave shields,\r\n          while the others, holding flat shields over their heads and\r\n          pressing them one against another, formed a protecting roof.\r\n          They could thus approach the walls under cover.\r\n\r\n     [78] Cp. ii. 101, note 459.\r\n\r\n     [79] For the term (_cuneus_) here used, see note on ii. 42.\r\n\r\n     [80] Cp. ii. 101, note 459.\r\n\r\n     [81] See note 77.\r\n\r\n     [82] As well as the buildings outside the walls.\r\n\r\n     [83] i.e. tore them off the standards and shields, and broke\r\n          the statues at head-quarters.\r\n\r\n     [84] See chap. 14.\r\n\r\n     [85] Cp. i. 66.\r\n\r\n     [86] Cp. ii. 45.\r\n\r\n     [87] i.e. even though it was in their own interest.\r\n\r\n     [88] Cp. ii. 70.\r\n\r\n     [89] Cp. ii. 67.\r\n\r\n     [90] The words were either attributed wrongly to Antonius or\r\n          were supposed to be spoken in answer to his question, 'Are\r\n          the furnaces not lit?'

He neither made any provision\r\nfor the war, nor tried to increase the efficiency of his troops either\r\nby haranguing or by drilling them. He did not keep himself in the\r\npublic eye, but retired into the pleasant shade of his gardens,\r\nregarding past, present, and future with equal indifference, like one\r\nof those listless animals which lie sluggish, and torpid so long as\r\nyou supply them with food. While he thus loitered languid and indolent\r\nin the woods of Aricia,[95] he received the startling news of Lucilius\r\nBassus' treachery and the disaffection of the fleet at Ravenna.[96]\r\nSoon afterwards he heard with mixed feelings of distress and\r\nsatisfaction that Caecina had deserted him and had been imprisoned by\r\nthe army. On his insensate nature joy had more effect than trouble.\r\nHe returned in triumph to Rome and at a crowded meeting praised the\r\ndevotion of the troops in extravagant terms. He gave orders for the\r\nimprisonment of Publilius Sabinus, the prefect of the Guards, on the\r\nground of his intimacy with Caecina, and appointed Alfenus Varus[97]\r\nin his place.\r\n\r\nHe next delivered a pompous and elaborate speech in the senate,         37\r\nwhere he was loaded with far-fetched compliments by the members.\r\nLucius Vitellius rose to propose a harsh sentence against Caecina. The\r\nrest of the house inveighed with assumed indignation against the\r\nconsul who had betrayed his country, the general who had betrayed his\r\ncommander-in-chief, the friend who had betrayed his benefactor to whom\r\nhe owed all his riches and distinction. But their protestations of\r\nsympathy with Vitellius really voiced their personal vexation.[98]\r\nNone of the speeches contained any criticism of the Flavian generals.\r\nThey threw the blame on the misguided and impolitic action of the\r\narmies, and with cautious circumlocution avoided all direct mention of\r\nVespasian. Caecina's consulship[99] had still one day to run, and\r\nRosius Regulus actually made humble petition for this one day's\r\noffice, Vitellius' offer and his acceptance exciting universal\r\nderision. Thus he entered and abdicated his office on the same day,\r\nthe last of October. Men who were learned in constitutional history\r\npointed out that no one before had ever been elected to fill a\r\nvacancy without the passing of a bill or some act of deprivation,\r\nalthough there was precedent for the one day consulship in the case of\r\nCaninius Rebilus when Caius Caesar was dictator and the civil war\r\nnecessitated prompt rewards.[100]\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the news of the death of Junius                38\r\nBlaesus[101] gave rise to much talk. I give the story as I find it.\r\nWhen Vitellius was lying seriously ill at his house in the Servilian\r\nPark, he noticed that a neighbouring mansion was brilliantly\r\nilluminated at night. On asking the reason, he was told that Caecina\r\nTuscus[102] was giving a large dinner-party, at which Junius Blaesus\r\nwas the chief guest. He further received an exaggerated account of\r\ntheir extravagance and dissipation. Some of his informants even made\r\nspecific charges against Tuscus and others, but especially accused\r\nBlaesus for spending his days in revelry while his emperor lay ill.\r\nThere are people who keep a sharp eye on every sign of an emperor's\r\ndispleasure. They soon made sure that Vitellius was furious and that\r\nBlaesus' ruin would be an easy task, so they cast Lucius Vitellius for\r\nthe part of common informer. He had a mean and jealous dislike for\r\nBlaesus, whose spotless reputation far outshone his own, which was\r\ntainted with every kind of infamy. Bursting into the emperor's\r\napartment, he caught up Vitellius' young son in his arms and fell at\r\nhis feet. When asked the reason of this excitement, he said it was due\r\nto no anxiety for himself; all his suit and all his prayers were for\r\nhis brother and his brother's children. Their fears of Vespasian were\r\nidle: between him and Vitellius lay all the legions of Germany, all\r\nthose brave and loyal provinces, and an immeasurable space of land and\r\nsea. 'It is here in Rome,' he cried, 'in the bosom of our household\r\nthat we have an enemy to fear, one who boasts the Junii and Antonii as\r\nhis ancestors, one who shows himself affable and munificent to the\r\ntroops, posing as a descendant of imperial stock.[103] It is to him\r\nthat Rome's attention turns, while you, Sire, careless who is friend\r\nor foe, cherish in your bosom a rival, who sits feasting at his table\r\nand watches his emperor in pain. You must requite his unseasonable\r\ngaiety with a night of deadly sorrow, in which he may both know and\r\nfeel that Vitellius lives and is his emperor, and, if anything should\r\nhappen, has a son to be his heir.'\r\n\r\nVitellius hesitated anxiously between his criminal desires and his      39\r\nfear that, if he deferred Blaesus' death, he might hasten his own\r\nruin, or by giving official orders for it might raise a storm of\r\nindignation. He decided to proceed by poison. The suspicion against\r\nhim he confirmed by going to see Blaesus and showing obvious\r\nsatisfaction. Moreover, he was heard to make the savage boast that he\r\nhad, to quote his own words, 'feasted his eyes on his enemy's\r\ndeathbed.'\r\n\r\nBlaesus, besides his distinguished origin and refined character, was\r\nsteadfastly loyal. Even before the decline of Vitellius' cause he had\r\nbeen canvassed by Caecina and other party leaders, who were turning\r\nagainst the emperor, and had met them with a persistent refusal. He\r\nwas a man of quiet and blameless life, with no ambition for the\r\nprincipate or, indeed, for any sudden distinction, but he could not\r\nescape the danger of being considered worthy of it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fabius Valens, encumbered by a long train of harlots and      40\r\neunuchs, was conducting a leisurely advance, most unlike a march to\r\nthe front, when couriers arrived post-haste with the news that\r\nLucilius Bassus had surrendered the Ravenna fleet.[104] If he had\r\nhurried forward on his march he might have been in time to save\r\nCaecina's faltering loyalty, or to have joined the legions before the\r\ncritical engagement was fought. Many, indeed, advised him to avoid\r\nRavenna and to make his way by obscure by-roads to Hostilia or\r\nCremona. Others wanted him to send to Rome for the Guards and to break\r\nthrough the enemy's lines with a strong force. Valens himself, with\r\nhelpless indecision, let the time for action go by while he took\r\nadvice; and then rejecting the advice he was offered, chose the middle\r\ncourse, which is always the worst in a crisis, and thus failed both in\r\ncourage and in caution.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Vitellius demanding reinforcements, and there arrived       41\r\nthree cohorts of Guards and a regiment of cavalry from Britain, too\r\nmany to slip through unobserved and too few to force a passage. But\r\neven in such a crisis as this Valens' reputation was as unsavoury as\r\never. He was still believed to use violence in the pursuit of illicit\r\npleasures, and to betray the confidence of his hosts by seducing their\r\nwives and families. He had money and authority to help him, and the\r\nfeverish impatience of one whose star is on the wane. At last the\r\narrival of the reinforcements revealed the perversity of his strategy.\r\nHe had too few men to assume the offensive, even if they had been\r\nunquestionably loyal, and their loyalty was under grave suspicion.\r\nHowever, their sense of decency and respect for the general restrained\r\nthem for a while, though such ties are soon broken when troops are\r\ndisinclined for danger and indifferent to disgrace.[105] Fearing\r\ntrouble, he sent the Guards forward to Ariminum[106] with the cavalry\r\nto secure the rear. Valens himself, with a few companions, whose\r\nloyalty had survived misfortune, turned off into Umbria and thence to\r\nEtruria, where he learnt the result of the battle of Cremona.\r\nThereupon he formed a plan, which was far from cowardly and might have\r\nhad alarming consequences, if it had succeeded. He was to seize ships\r\nand cross to some point on the coast of Narbonnese Gaul, whence he\r\ncould rouse the provinces of Gaul and the native German tribes, and\r\nthus raise forces for a fresh outbreak of war.\r\n\r\nValens' departure having dispirited the troops at Ariminum,             42\r\nCornelius Fuscus[107] advanced his force and, stationing\r\nLiburnian[108] cruisers along the adjoining coast, invested the town\r\nby land and sea. The Flavians thus occupied the Umbrian plain and the\r\nsea-board of Picenum; and the Apennines now divided Italy between\r\nVitellius and Vespasian.\r\n\r\nValens, embarking from the Bay of Pisa, was either becalmed on a slow\r\nsea or caught by an unfavourable wind and had to put in at the harbour\r\nof Hercules Monoecus.[109] Stationed in the neighbourhood was Marius\r\nMaturus, the Governor of the Maritime Alps,[110] who had remained\r\nloyal to Vitellius, and, though surrounded by enemies, had so far been\r\nfaithful to his oath of allegiance. He gave Valens a friendly welcome\r\nand strongly advised him not to venture rashly into Narbonnese Gaul.\r\nThis alarmed Valens, who found also that his companions' loyalty was\r\nyielding to their fears. For Valerius Paulinus, the imperial agent      43\r\nin the province, was an energetic soldier who had been friendly with\r\nVespasian in old days, and had lately sworn all the surrounding\r\ncommunities to his cause. Having summoned to his flag all the Guards\r\ndischarged by Vitellius,[111] who needed no persuasion to resume the\r\nwar, he was now holding the colony of Forum Julii,[112] the key to the\r\ncommand of the sea. His influence carried the more weight since Forum\r\nJulii was his native town and, having once been an officer in the\r\nGuards, he was respected by the men. Besides this, the inhabitants\r\nsupported their fellow citizen, and in the hope of future\r\naggrandizement rendered enthusiastic service to the party. When the\r\nnews of these efficient preparations, somewhat exaggerated by rumour,\r\ncame to the ears of the Vitellians, who were already in some doubt,\r\nFabius Valens returned to the ships with four men of the Body Guard,\r\nthree of his friends and three centurions, while Maturus and the rest\r\npreferred to remain and swear allegiance to Vespasian. As for Valens,\r\nthough he felt safer at sea than among the cities on the coast, he was\r\nstill full of doubts for the future, since he was certain what he had\r\nto avoid but quite uncertain whom he could trust. Eventually a gale\r\ndrove him upon the Stoechades,[113] some islands belonging to\r\nMarseilles, and there he was overtaken by the cruisers which Paulinus\r\nhad sent in pursuit.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [94] The story returns again to ii. 101.\r\n\r\n     [95] La Riccia.\r\n\r\n     [96] See chap. 12.\r\n\r\n     [97] Hitherto camp-prefect (cp. ii. 29).\r\n\r\n     [98] Against Caecina for his inefficiency.\r\n\r\n     [99] Cp. i. 77.\r\n\r\n    [100] This was in 45 B.C., when Caesar was carrying on the\r\n          government with a high hand and small regard for precedent.\r\n          Holding an election on the last day of the year, he was told\r\n          that the consul was dead: there was no one to preside.

The movement had been begun in Spain by the First legion\r\n_Adjutrix_,[114] whose reverence for Otho's memory made them hate\r\nVitellius. They carried the Tenth and the Sixth[115] with them. The\r\nprovinces of Gaul soon followed suit. Britain was bound to his cause\r\nby the favour felt for one who had been sent there by Claudius in\r\ncommand of the Second legion, and had fought with great distinction in\r\nthe war. But the adherence of the province was to some extent opposed\r\nby the other legions, in which many of the centurions and soldiers had\r\nbeen promoted by Vitellius. They were used to their emperor and felt\r\nsome doubt about the change. This quarrel between the legions and       45\r\nthe constant rumours of civil war, encouraged the Britons to take\r\nheart. Their chief instigator was one Venutius. He was of a ferocious\r\ndisposition and hated the name of Rome, but his strongest motive was a\r\nprivate quarrel with Queen Cartimandua, a member of a powerful family,\r\nwho ruled the Brigantes.[116] Her authority had lately increased,\r\nsince she had betrayed King Caratacus into the hands of the Romans,\r\nand was thus considered to have provided Claudius Caesar with material\r\nfor his triumph.[117] Thus she had grown rich, and with prosperity\r\ncame demoralization. She threw over Venutius, who was her husband, and\r\ngave her hand and kingdom to his squire, Vellocatus. This crime soon\r\nproved the ruin of her house. The people supported her husband: she\r\ndefended her lover with passionate ferocity. Venutius therefore\r\nsummoned assistance and, aided by the simultaneous revolt of the\r\nBrigantes, brought Cartimandua into dire straits. She petitioned for\r\ntroops from Rome. Our auxiliaries, both horse and foot, then fought\r\nseveral engagements with varying success, but eventually rescued the\r\nqueen. Thus the kingdom was left in the hands of Venutius and the war\r\nin ours.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously a disturbance broke out in Germany, where         46\r\nthe inefficiency of the generals, the disaffection of the troops, the\r\nstrength of the enemy, and the treachery of our allies all combined to\r\nbring the Roman government into serious danger. The causes and history\r\nof this protracted struggle--for such it proved--we must leave to a\r\nlater chapter.[118] Amongst the Dacians[119] also there was trouble.\r\nThey could never be trusted, and now that the army was moved from\r\nMoesia they were no longer under the restraint of fear. At first they\r\nremained quiet and awaited developments. But when they saw Italy in\r\nthe flames of war, and found the whole empire divided into hostile\r\ncamps, they fell upon the winter-quarters of the auxiliary infantry\r\nand cavalry and began to occupy both banks of the Danube. They were on\r\nthe point of storming the Roman camp as well, when Mucianus, who knew\r\nof the victory at Cremona, sent the Sixth legion[120] against them.\r\nFor the empire was in danger of a double foreign invasion, if the\r\nDacians and the Germans had broken in from opposite directions. But\r\nhere, as so often, Rome's good fortune saved her by bringing Mucianus\r\non the scene with the forces of the East just at the moment when we\r\nhad settled matters at Cremona. Fonteius Agrippa, who had for the last\r\nyear been pro-consul in Asia, was transferred to the government of\r\nMoesia. His forces were strengthened by a draft from the defeated\r\nVitellian army, for in the interest of peace it seemed prudent to\r\ndistribute these troops over the provinces and to keep their hands\r\ntied by a foreign war.\r\n\r\nThe other peoples soon made their voices heard. Pontus[121] had         47\r\nsuddenly risen in a general rebellion at the instigation of a foreign\r\nmenial, who was in command of what had once been the royal fleet. He\r\nwas one of Polemo's freedmen, by name Anicetus, who had formerly been\r\ninfluential and resented the change which had converted the kingdom\r\ninto a province of the Roman empire. He accordingly enlisted the\r\nmaritime tribes of Pontus in Vitellius' service, attracting all the\r\nneediest ruffians with promises of plunder. At the head of no mean\r\nforce he suddenly fell upon Trapezus,[122] an ancient and famous city,\r\nfounded by Greek settlers on the frontier of the Pontic kingdom. There\r\nhe cut to pieces the auxiliaries, who had once formed the king's Body\r\nGuard, and, after receiving the Roman franchise, had adopted our\r\nensigns and equipment, while still retaining all the inefficiency and\r\ninsubordination of Greek troops. Anicetus also set fire to the\r\nfleet[123] and thus enjoyed complete mastery of the sea, since\r\nMucianus had moved the pick of his cruisers and all his troops to\r\nByzantium. The sea was overrun by natives too, who had hurriedly built\r\nthemselves boats. These, which they call 'arks',[124] are\r\nbroad-bottomed boats with low sides, built without any brass or iron\r\nrivets. In a rough sea, as the waves rise higher and higher, the\r\nheight of the sides is raised by the addition of planks which, in the\r\nend, enclose the whole boat under a sort of roof. They are thus left\r\nto toss up and down on the waves. They have bows at both ends and the\r\npaddles can be used on either side, since it is as easy and as safe to\r\nrow in one direction as in the other.\r\n\r\nThis state of things attracting Vespasian's attention, he was           48\r\nobliged to send out a picked force of detachments from the legions\r\nunder Virdius Geminus, a soldier of tried experience. He attacked the\r\nenemy while they were dispersed in all directions in quest of plunder,\r\nand drove them back to their ships. He then had some Liburnian\r\ncruisers hurriedly constructed and ran Anicetus to ground in the mouth\r\nof the river Chobus,[125] where he had taken refuge with the King of\r\nthe Sedochezi tribe, whose alliance he had purchased by bribes. At\r\nfirst, indeed, the king endeavoured to protect his petitioner by using\r\nthreats of violence, but he soon saw that it was a choice between\r\nmaking war or being paid for his treachery. The barbarian's sense of\r\nhonour was unequal to this strain. He came to terms, surrendered\r\nAnicetus and the other fugitives, and thus put an end to 'the slaves'\r\nwar'.\r\n\r\nThis victory delighted Vespasian: everything was succeeding beyond his\r\nhopes: and to crown all the news of the battle of Cremona now reached\r\nhim in Egypt. He hurried forward all the faster towards Alexandria\r\nwith the object of bringing starvation[126] upon Vitellius' defeated\r\ntroops and the inhabitants of Rome, who were already feeling the pinch\r\nof diminished imports. For he was at the same time making preparations\r\nfor an invasion of the adjacent province of Africa[127] by land and\r\nsea. By cutting off their corn supply he hoped to reduce the enemy to\r\nfamine and disunion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [114] The marines (see ii. 67, i. 6).\r\n\r\n    [115] X Gemina, VI Victrix.\r\n\r\n    [116] They occupied a large district of the north of England,\r\n          from the Trent to the Tyne.\r\n\r\n    [117] As a matter of fact his triumph took place in 44.\r\n          Caratacus was brought to Rome in 51.

Meanwhile, after Cremona, the behaviour\r\nof Antonius Primus was not so blameless as before. He had settled the\r\nwar, he felt; the rest would be plain sailing. Or, perhaps, in such a\r\nnature as his success only brought to light his greed and arrogance\r\nand all his other dormant vices. While harrying Italy like a conquered\r\ncountry, he courted the goodwill of his troops and used every word and\r\nevery action to pave his way to power. He allowed his men to appoint\r\ncenturions themselves in place of those who had fallen, and thus gave\r\nthem a taste for insubordination; for their choice fell on the most\r\nturbulent spirits. The generals no longer commanded the men, but were\r\ndragged at the heels of their caprices. This revolutionary system,\r\nutterly fatal to good discipline, was exploited by Antonius for his\r\nown profit.[129] Of Mucianus' approach he had no fears, and thus made\r\na mistake even more fatal than despising Vespasian.[130]\r\n\r\nHis advance, however, continued. As winter was at hand[131] and         50\r\nthe Po had inundated the meadows, his column marched unencumbered by\r\nheavy baggage. The main body of the victorious legions was left\r\nbehind at Verona, together with such of the soldiers as were\r\nincapacitated by wounds or old age, and many besides who were still in\r\ngood condition. Having already broken the back of the campaign,\r\nAntonius felt strong enough with his auxiliary horse and foot and some\r\npicked detachments from the legions. The Eleventh[132] had voluntarily\r\njoined the advance. They had held back at first, but, seeing Antonius'\r\nsuccess, were distressed to think they had had no share in it. The\r\ncolumn was also accompanied by a force of six thousand Dalmatian\r\ntroops, which had been recently raised. The ex-consul, Pompeius\r\nSilvanus,[133] commanded the column, but the actual control was in the\r\nhands of a general named Annius Bassus. Silvanus was quite ineffective\r\nas a general, and wasted every chance of action in talking about it.\r\nBassus, while showing all due respect, managed him completely, and was\r\nalways ready with quiet efficiency to do anything that had to be done.\r\nTheir force was further increased by enlisting the best of the marines\r\nfrom the Ravenna fleet, who were clamouring for service in the\r\nlegions. The vacancies in the fleet were filled by Dalmatians. The\r\narmy and its generals halted at Fanum Fortunae,[134] still hesitating\r\nwhat policy to adopt, for they had heard that the Guards were on the\r\nmove from Rome, and supposed that the Apennines were held by troops.\r\nAnd they had fears of their own. Supplies were scarce in a district\r\ndevastated by war. The men were mutinous and demanded 'shoe-money',[135]\r\nas they called the donative, with alarming insistence. No provision\r\nhad been made either for money or for stores. The precipitate greed of\r\nthe soldiers made further difficulties, for they each looted what\r\nmight have served for them all.\r\n\r\nI find among the best authorities evidence which shows how              51\r\nwickedly careless were the victorious army of all considerations of\r\nright and wrong. They tell how a trooper professed that he had killed\r\nhis brother in the last battle, and demanded a reward from his\r\ngenerals. The dictates of humanity forbade them to remunerate such a\r\nmurder, but in the interests of civil war they dared not punish it.\r\nThey had put him off with the plea that they could not at the moment\r\nreward his service adequately. And there the story stops. However, a\r\nsimilar crime had occurred in earlier civil wars. In the battle which\r\nPompeius Strabo fought against Cinna at the Janiculum,[136] one of his\r\nsoldiers killed his own brother and then, realizing what he had done,\r\ncommitted suicide. This is recorded by Sisenna.[137] Our ancestors, it\r\nseems, had a livelier sense than we have both of the glory of good\r\ndeeds and the shame of bad.[138] These and other such instances from\r\npast history may be appropriately cited, whenever the subject seems to\r\ndemand either an example of good conduct or some consolation for a\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nAntonius and his fellow generals decided to send the cavalry ahead      52\r\nto explore the whole of Umbria, and to see whether any of the\r\nApennines were accessible by a gentler route; to summon the eagles and\r\nstandards[139] and all the troops at Verona,[140] and to fill the Po\r\nand the sea with provision ships. Some of the generals continually\r\nsuggested obstacles. Antonius had grown too big for his place, and\r\nthey had surer hopes of reward from Mucianus. He was distressed that\r\nvictory had come so soon, and felt that, if he was not present when\r\nRome was taken, he would lose his share in the war and its glory. So\r\nhe kept on writing to Antonius and Varus in ambiguous terms, sometimes\r\nurging them to 'press forward on their path', sometimes expatiating on\r\n'the manifold value of delay'. He thus managed to arrange that he\r\ncould disclaim responsibility in case of a reverse, or acknowledge\r\ntheir policy as his own if it succeeded. To Plotius Grypus, whom\r\nVespasian had lately raised to senatorial rank and put in command of a\r\nlegion, and to his other trusty friends he sent less ambiguous\r\ninstructions, and they all wrote back criticizing the haste with which\r\nAntonius and Varus acted. This was just what Mucianus wanted. He\r\nforwarded the letters to Vespasian with the result that Antonius'\r\nplans and exploits were not appreciated as highly as Antonius had\r\nhoped. This he took very ill and threw the blame on Mucianus,           53\r\nwhose charges he conceived had cheapened his exploits. Being little\r\naccustomed to control his tongue or to obey orders, he was most\r\nunguarded in his conversation and composed a letter to Vespasian in\r\npresumptuous language which ill befitted a subject, making various\r\ncovert charges against Mucianus. 'It was I,' he wrote, 'who brought\r\nthe legions of Pannonia into the field:[141] it was my stimulus which\r\nstirred up the officers in Moesia:[142] it was by my persistence that\r\nwe broke through the Alps, seized hold of Italy and cut off the German\r\nand Raetian auxiliaries.[143] When Vitellius' legions were all\r\nscattered and disunited, it was I who flung the cavalry on them like a\r\nwhirlwind, and then pressed home the attack with the infantry all day\r\nand all night. That victory is my greatest achievement and it is\r\nentirely my own. As for the mishap at Cremona, that was the fault of\r\nthe war. In old days the civil wars cost the country far more damage\r\nand involved the destruction of more than one town. It is not with\r\ncouriers and dispatches that I serve my master, but with my sword in\r\nmy hand. Nor can it be said that I have interfered with the glory of\r\nthe men who have meanwhile settled matters in Dacia.[144] What peace\r\nin Moesia is to them, the safety and welfare of Italy are to me. It\r\nwas my encouragement which brought the provinces of Gaul and of Spain,\r\nthe strongest parts of the whole world, over to Vespasian's side. But\r\nmy labours will prove useless, if the reward for the dangers I have\r\nrun is to fall to the man who was not there to share them.' All this\r\nreached the ears of Mucianus and a serious quarrel resulted. Antonius\r\nkept it up in a frank spirit of dislike, while Mucianus showed a\r\ncunning which was far more implacable.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [128] The narrative is here resumed from the end of chap. 35.\r\n\r\n    [129] Would-be centurions doubtless bribed him to influence\r\n          the soldiers in their favour.\r\n\r\n    [130] Vespasian was too big to mind being despised; Mucianus\r\n          was not, and eventually retaliated (cp. iv. 11).\r\n\r\n    [131] November.\r\n\r\n    [132] From Dalmatia (see ii. 11, 67).\r\n\r\n    [133] Governor of Dalmatia (cp. ii. 86).\r\n\r\n    [134] Fano.\r\n\r\n    [135] Apparently soldiers' slang.

Had he admitted the facts and sought\r\nadvice, hope and strength were still left to him: his pretension that\r\nall went well only made matters worse. He was himself extraordinarily\r\nsilent about the war, and in Rome all discussion of the subject was\r\nforbidden. This only increased the number of people who, if permitted,\r\nwould have told the truth, but in the face of this prohibition spread\r\ngrossly exaggerated rumours. Nor were the Flavian leaders slow to\r\nfoster these rumours. Whenever they captured Vitellian spies they\r\nescorted them round the camp to show them the strength of the winning\r\narmy, and sent them back again. Vitellius cross-examined each of them\r\nin private and then had them murdered. A centurion named Julius\r\nAgrestis, after many interviews, in which he endeavoured in vain to\r\nfire Vitellius' courage, at last with heroic persistence induced the\r\nemperor to send him to inspect the enemy's forces and discover what\r\nhad really happened at Cremona. He made no attempt to deceive Antonius\r\nby concealing the object of his mission, but openly avowed the\r\nemperor's instructions, stated his intentions and demanded to be shown\r\neverything. He was given guides, who showed him the field of battle,\r\nthe ruins of Cremona and the captured legions. Back went Agrestis to\r\nVitellius. Finding that the emperor disbelieved his report and even\r\nsuggested that he had been bribed, he said, 'You want some certain\r\nevidence and, since you have no further use for me either alive or\r\ndead, I will give you evidence that you can believe.' And he was as\r\ngood as his word. He went straight from the emperor's presence and\r\ncommitted suicide. Some say he was killed by order of Vitellius, but\r\nthey give the same account of his heroic devotion.[145]\r\n\r\nVitellius was like a man roused from sleep. He dispatched Julius        55\r\nPriscus and Alfenus Varus[146] with fourteen cohorts of Guards and all\r\nhis available cavalry to hold the Apennines. A legion levied from the\r\nmarines[147] was sent after them. This large army of picked men and\r\nhorses, if there had been any general to lead it, was strong enough to\r\nhave even taken the offensive. His other cohorts[148] were given to\r\nhis brother, Lucius Vitellius, for the protection of the city. The\r\nemperor himself gave up none of his habitual luxuries, but, feeling\r\nnervous and depressed, he hurried on the elections and nominated\r\nconsuls for several years in advance. He lavished special\r\ncharters[149] on allied communities and extended Latin rights[150] to\r\nforeign towns: he remitted taxation here, granted immunities there. In\r\nfact, he took no thought for the future, and did his best to cripple\r\nthe empire. However, the mob accepted these munificent grants with\r\nopen mouths. Fools paid money for them, but wise men held them\r\ninvalid, since they could be neither given nor received without a\r\nrevolution. At last he yielded to the demands of the army and joined\r\nthe camp at Mevania,[151] where they had taken up their position. A\r\nlong train of senators followed him, many moved by their ambition, but\r\nmost by their fears. Here he was still undecided and at the mercy of\r\ntreacherous advice.\r\n\r\nDuring one of his speeches a portent occurred. A cloud of               56\r\nill-omened birds[152] flew over his head and its density obscured the\r\ndaylight. To this was added another omen of disaster. A bull broke\r\nfrom the altar, scattered the utensils for the ceremony, and escaped\r\nso far away that it had to be killed instead of being sacrificed\r\naccording to the proper ritual. But the chief portent was Vitellius\r\nhimself. He was ignorant of soldiering, incapable of forethought: knew\r\nnothing of drill or scouting, or how far operations should be pressed\r\nforward or protracted. He always had to ask some one else. At every\r\nfresh piece of news his expression and gait betrayed his alarm. And\r\nthen he would get drunk. At last he found camp life too tedious, and\r\non learning of a mutiny in the fleet at Misenum[153] he returned to\r\nRome. Every fresh blow terrified him, but of the real crisis he seemed\r\ninsensible. For it was open to him to cross the Apennines and with his\r\nfull strength unimpaired to attack the enemy while they were worn out\r\nwith cold and hunger. But by breaking up his forces he sent his\r\nkeenest soldiers, stubbornly loyal to the last, to be killed or taken\r\nprisoner. The more experienced of his centurions disapproved of this\r\npolicy and would have told him the truth, if they had been consulted.\r\nBut the emperor's intimates refused them admittance. He had, indeed,\r\nformed a habit of regarding wholesome advice as unpleasant, and\r\nrefusing to listen to any that was not agreeable, and in the long run\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nIn civil war individual enterprise counts for much. The mutiny of       57\r\nthe fleet at Misenum had been engineered by Claudius Faventinus, a\r\ncenturion whom Galba had dismissed in disgrace. To obtain his object\r\nhe had forged a letter from Vespasian promising rewards for treachery.\r\nThe admiral, Claudius Apollinaris,[154] was neither a staunch loyalist\r\nnor an enthusiastic traitor. Accordingly Apinius Tiro, an ex-praetor,\r\nwho happened to be at Minturnae,[155] offered to take the lead of the\r\nrebels. They proceeded to win over the colonies and country towns.\r\nPuteoli in particular was strong for Vespasian, while Capua remained\r\nloyal to Vitellius, for they dragged their local jealousies into the\r\ncivil war. To pacify the excited troops Vitellius chose Claudius\r\nJulianus, who had lately been in command of the fleet at Misenum and\r\nhad allowed lax discipline. To support him he was given one cohort of\r\nthe city garrison and the force of gladiators already serving under\r\nhim. The two parties encamped close to one another, and it was not\r\nlong before Julianus came over to Vespasian's side. They then joined\r\nforces and occupied Tarracina,[156] which owed its strength more to\r\nits walls and situation than to the character of its new garrison.\r\n\r\nWhen news of this reached Vitellius, he left part of his force at       58\r\nNarnia[157] with the prefects of the Guard,[158] and sent his brother\r\nLucius with six regiments of Guards and five hundred horse to cope\r\nwith the threatened outbreak in Campania. His own nervous depression\r\nwas somewhat relieved by the enthusiasm of the troops and of the\r\npopulace, who clamoured loudly for arms. For he dignified this\r\npoor-spirited mob, which would never dare to do anything but shout, by\r\nthe specious titles of 'the army' or 'his legions'. His friends were\r\nall untrustworthy in proportion to their eminence; but on the advice\r\nof his freedmen he held a levy for conscription and swore in all who\r\ngave their names. As their numbers were too great, he gave the task of\r\nselection to the two consuls. From each of the senators he levied a\r\nfixed number of slaves and a weight of silver. The knights offered\r\nmoney and personal service, while even freedmen volunteered similar\r\nassistance. Indeed, protestations of loyalty prompted by fear, had\r\ngradually changed into real sympathy. People began to feel pity, not\r\nperhaps so much for Vitellius as for the throne and its misfortunes.\r\nHe himself by his looks, his voice, his tears made ceaseless demands\r\nupon their compassion, promising rewards lavishly and, as men do when\r\nthey are frightened, beyond all limits. He had hitherto refused the\r\ntitle of Caesar,[159] but he now expressed a wish for it. He had a\r\nsuperstitious respect for the name, and in moments of terror one\r\nlistens as much to gossip as to sound advice. However, while a rash\r\nand ill-conceived undertaking may prosper at the outset, in time it\r\nalways begins to flag. Gradually the senators and knights deserted\r\nhim. At first they hesitated and waited till his back was turned, but\r\nsoon they ceased to care and openly showed their disrespect. At last\r\nVitellius grew ashamed of the failure of his efforts and excused them\r\nfrom the services which they refused to render.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [145] This incident was probably another historical\r\n          commonplace.

The\r\nSamnites, Pelignians, and Marsians were now induced to rise. They were\r\njealous of Campania for stealing a march on them, and the change of\r\nmasters, as so often happens, made them perform all their military\r\nduties with the utmost alacrity. But in crossing the Apennines\r\nAntonius' army suffered severely from the rough December weather.\r\nThough they met with no opposition, they found it hard enough to\r\nstruggle through the snow, and realized what danger they would have\r\nhad to face if Vitellius had not happened to turn back. Certainly\r\nchance helped the Flavian generals quite as often as their own\r\nstrategy. Here they came across Petilius Cerialis,[162] who had been\r\nenabled by his knowledge of the country to elude Vitellius' outposts,\r\ndisguised as a peasant. As he was a near relative of Vespasian and a\r\ndistinguished soldier he was given a place on the staff. Several\r\nauthorities say that Flavius Sabinus and Domitian[163] were also\r\nafforded facilities for escape, and that Antonius sent messengers who\r\ncontrived by various devices to get through to them, and made\r\narrangements for an interview and safe conduct. Sabinus, however,\r\npleaded that his health was unequal to the fatigue of such a bold\r\nstep. Domitian was quite ready to venture, but although the guards to\r\nwhom Vitellius had entrusted him, promised that they would share his\r\nflight, he was afraid they might be laying a trap for him. As a matter\r\nof fact, Vitellius was too anxious for the safety of his own relatives\r\nto plot any harm against Domitian.\r\n\r\nArrived at Carsulae[164] the Flavian generals took a few days'          60\r\nrest and awaited the arrival of the main legionary force.[165] The\r\nplace suited them admirably for an encampment. It commanded a wide\r\nview, and with so many prosperous towns in the rear their supplies\r\nwere safe. The Vitellians too, were only ten miles away, and they had\r\nhopes of negotiating treason with them. The soldiers chafed at this\r\ndelay, preferring victory to peace. They did not even want to wait for\r\ntheir own legions, for there would be more plunder than danger to\r\nshare with them. Antonius accordingly summoned a meeting of the men\r\nand explained to them that Vitellius still had troops at his command.\r\nReflection might make them waver, despair would steel their hearts. In\r\ncivil war, he told them, the first steps may be left to chance,\r\nnothing but careful strategy can win the final victory. The fleet at\r\nMisenum and the richest districts of Campania had already deserted\r\nVitellius, and in the whole world nothing was left to him now except\r\nthe country between Narnia and Tarracina. The battle of Cremona had\r\nbrought them credit enough, and the destruction of the town more than\r\nenough discredit. Their desire must be not to take Rome but to save\r\nit. They would gain richer rewards and far more glory if they could\r\nshow that they had saved the senate and people of Rome without\r\nshedding a drop of blood. Such considerations as these calmed their\r\nexcitement, and it was not long before the legions arrived.\r\n\r\nAlarmed at the repute of this augmented army, Vitellius' Guards         61\r\nbegan to waver. There was no one to encourage them to fight, while\r\nmany urged them to desert, being eager to hand over their companies or\r\nsquadrons to the enemy and by such a gift to secure the victor's\r\ngratitude for the future. These also let the Flavians know that the\r\nnext camp at Interamna[166] had a garrison of four hundred cavalry.\r\nVarus was promptly sent off with a light marching force, and the few\r\nwho offered resistance were killed. The majority threw away their arms\r\nand begged for quarter. Some escaped to the main camp[167] and spread\r\nuniversal panic by exaggerating the strength and prowess of the enemy,\r\nin order to mitigate the disgrace of losing the fort. In the Vitellian\r\ncamp all offences went unpunished: desertion met with sure reward.\r\nTheir loyalty soon gave way and a competition in treachery began.\r\nTribunes and centurions deserted daily, but not the common soldiers,\r\nwho had grown stubbornly faithful to Vitellius. At last, however,\r\nPriscus and Alfenus[168] abandoned the camp and returned to Vitellius,\r\nthus finally releasing all the others from any obligation to blush for\r\ntheir treachery.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Fabius Valens[169] was executed in his prison       62\r\nat Urbinum, and his head was exhibited to Vitellius' Guards to show\r\nthem that further hope was vain. For they cherished a belief that\r\nValens had made his way into Germany, and was there mustering his old\r\nforce and fresh troops as well. This evidence of his death threw them\r\ninto despair. The Flavian army was vastly inspirited by it and\r\nregarded Valens' death as the end of the war.\r\n\r\nValens had been born at Anagnia of an equestrian family. He was a man\r\nof loose morality, not without intellectual gifts, who by indulging in\r\nfrivolity posed as a wit. In Nero's time he had acted in a\r\nharlequinade at the Juvenalian Games.[170] At first he pleaded\r\ncompulsion, but afterwards he acted voluntarily, and his performances\r\nwere rather clever than respectable. Rising to the command of a\r\nlegion, he supported Verginius[171] and then defamed his character. He\r\nmurdered Fonteius Capito,[171] whose loyalty he had undermined--or\r\nperhaps because he had failed to do so. He betrayed Galba and remained\r\nfaithful to Vitellius, a merit to which the treachery of others served\r\nas a foil.\r\n\r\nNow that their hopes were crushed on all sides, the Vitellians          63\r\nprepared to go over to the enemy. But even at this crisis they saved\r\ntheir honour by marching down with their standards and colours to the\r\nplains below Narnia, where the Flavian army was drawn up in full\r\narmour ready for battle in two deep lines on either side of the road.\r\nThe Vitellians marched in between and were surrounded. Antonius then\r\nspoke to them kindly and told them to remain, some at Narnia and some\r\nat Interamna. He also left behind some of the victorious legions,\r\nwhich were strong enough to quell any outbreak but would not molest\r\nthem so long as they remained quiet.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [160] See chap. 55.\r\n\r\n    [161] See chap. 56.\r\n\r\n    [162] A distinguished officer, who successfully crushed the\r\n          rebellion on the Rhine (Book IV), and became governor of\r\n          Britain in 71.\r\n\r\n    [163] Vespasian's brother and younger son were both in Rome,\r\n          the former still holding the office of city prefect (cp. i. 46).\r\n\r\n    [164] Casigliano.\r\n\r\n    [165] From Verona (see chap. 52).\r\n\r\n    [166] Terni.\r\n\r\n    [167] At Narnia.\r\n\r\n    [168] The two prefects of the guard.\r\n\r\n    [169] See chap. 43.\r\n\r\n    [170] Properly a festival to celebrate the first cutting of\r\n          the beard.

Mucianus wrote him\r\nletters to the same effect. Vitellius usually took these offers\r\nseriously and talked about the number of slaves he would have and the\r\nchoice of a seaside place. He had sunk, indeed, into such mental\r\ntorpor that, if other people had not remembered that he was an\r\nemperor, he was certainly beginning to forget it himself. However,      64\r\nit was to Flavius Sabinus, the City Prefect, that the leading men at\r\nRome addressed themselves. They urged him secretly not to lose all\r\nshare in the glory of victory. They pointed out that the City Garrison\r\nwas under his own command, and that he could count on the police and\r\ntheir own bands of slaves, to say nothing of the good fortune of the\r\nparty and all the advantage that victory gives. He must not leave all\r\nthe glory to Antonius and Varus. Vitellius had nothing left but a few\r\nregiments of guards, who were seriously alarmed at the bad news which\r\ncame from every quarter. As for the populace, their feelings soon\r\nchanged, and if he put himself at their head, they would be just as\r\nloud in their flattery of Vespasian. Vitellius himself could not even\r\ncope with success, and disaster had positively paralysed him. The\r\ncredit of ending the war would go to the man who seized the city. It\r\nwas eminently fitting that Sabinus should secure the throne for his\r\nbrother, and that Vespasian should hold him higher than any one else.\r\n\r\nAge had enfeebled Sabinus, and he showed no alacrity to listen to       65\r\nsuch talk as this. Some people covertly insinuated that he was jealous\r\nof his brother's success and was trying to delay its realization.\r\nFlavius Sabinus was the elder brother and, while they were both\r\nprivate persons, he had been the richer and more influential. It was\r\nalso believed that he had been chary in helping Vespasian to recover\r\nhis financial position, and had taken a mortgage on his house and\r\nestates. Consequently, though they remained openly friendly, there\r\nwere suspicions of a secret enmity between them. The more charitable\r\nexplanation is that Sabinus's gentle nature shrank from the idea of\r\nbloodshed and massacre, and that this was his reason for so constantly\r\ndiscussing with Vitellius the prospects of peace and a capitulation on\r\nterms. After several interviews at his house they finally came to a\r\nsettlement--so the report went--at the Temple of Apollo.[172] To the\r\nactual conversation there were only two witnesses, Cluvius Rufus[173]\r\nand Silius Italicus,[174] but the expression of their faces was\r\nwatched from a distance. Vitellius was said to look abject and\r\ndemoralized: Sabinus showed less sign of pride than of pity.\r\n\r\nHad Vitellius found it no harder to persuade his friends than to        66\r\nmake his own renunciation, Vespasian's army might have marched into\r\nRome without bloodshed. But as it was, each of his friends in\r\nproportion to his loyalty persisted in refusing terms of peace. They\r\npointed to the danger and disgrace. Would their conqueror keep his\r\npromises any longer than he liked? However great Vespasian's\r\nself-confidence, he could not allow Vitellius to live in private. Nor\r\nwould the losers acquiesce: their very pity would be a menace.[175]\r\n'Of course,' they said, 'you are an old man. You have done with\r\nfortune, good or bad. But what sort of repute or position would your\r\nson Germanicus[176] enjoy? At present they are promising you money and\r\na household, and the pleasant shores of Campania. But when once\r\nVespasian has seized the throne, neither he nor his friends nor even\r\nhis army will feel their safety assured until the rival claimant is\r\ndead. They imprisoned Fabius Valens and meant to make use of him if a\r\ncrisis occurred, but they found him too great an incubus. You may be\r\nsure that Antonius and Fuscus and that typical representative of the\r\nparty, Mucianus, will have no choice but to kill you. Julius Caesar\r\ndid not let Pompey live unmolested, nor Augustus Antony.[177] Do you\r\nsuppose that Vespasian's is a loftier disposition? Why, he was one of\r\nyour father's dependants,[178] when your father was Claudius's\r\ncolleague.[179] No, think of your father's censorship, his three\r\nconsulships,[179] and all the honour your great house has won. You\r\nmust not disgrace them. Despair, at least, should nerve your courage.\r\nThe troops are steadfast; you still enjoy the people's favour. Indeed,\r\nnothing worse can happen to you than what we are eager to face of our\r\nown free will. If we are defeated, we must die; if we surrender, we\r\nmust die. All that matters is whether we breathe our last amid mockery\r\nand insult or bravely and with honour.'\r\n\r\nBut Vitellius was deaf to all courageous counsel. His mind was          67\r\nobsessed with pity for his wife and children, and an anxious fear that\r\nobstinate resistance might make the conqueror merciless towards them.\r\nHe had also a mother,[180] very old and infirm, but she had\r\nopportunely died a few days before and thus forestalled the ruin of\r\nher house. All she had got out of her son's principate was sorrow and\r\na good name. On December 17 he heard the news that the legion and the\r\nGuards at Narnia had deserted him and surrendered to the enemy. He at\r\nonce put on mourning and left the palace, surrounded by his sorrowful\r\nhousehold. His small son was carried in a little litter, as though\r\nthis had been his funeral. The populace uttered untimely flatteries:\r\nthe soldiers kept an ominous silence.\r\n\r\nOn that day there was no one so indifferent to the tragedy of           68\r\nhuman life as to be unmoved by this spectacle. A Roman emperor,\r\nyesterday master of the inhabited world, had left the seat of his\r\nauthority, and was now passing through the streets of the city,\r\nthrough the crowding populace, quitting the throne. Such a sight had\r\nnever been seen or heard of before. The dictator, Caesar, had been the\r\nvictim of sudden violence; Caligula of a secret conspiracy. Nero's had\r\nbeen a stealthy flight to some obscure country house under cover of\r\nnight. Piso and Galba might almost be said to have fallen on the field\r\nof battle. But here was Vitellius--before the assembly of his own\r\npeople, his own soldiers around him, with women even looking\r\non--uttering a few sentences suitable to his miserable situation. He\r\nsaid it was in the interest of peace and of his country that he now\r\nresigned. He begged them only to retain his memory in their hearts and\r\nto take pity on his brother, his wife, and his little innocent\r\nchildren. As he said this, he held out his son to them and commended\r\nhim, now to individuals, now to the whole assembly. At last tears\r\nchoked his voice. Turning to the consul, Caecilius Simplex,[181] who\r\nwas standing by, he unstrapped his sword and offered to surrender it\r\nas a symbol of his power over the life and death of his subjects. The\r\nconsul refused. The people in the assembly shouted 'No'. So he left\r\nthem with the intention of depositing the regalia in the Temple of\r\nConcord and then going to his brother's house. But he was faced with a\r\nstill louder uproar. They refused to let him enter a private house,\r\nand shouted to him to return to the palace. They blocked every other\r\nway and only left the road leading into the Via Sacra open.[182] Not\r\nknowing what else to do, Vitellius returned to the palace.\r\n\r\nA rumour of his abdication had preceded him, and Flavius Sabinus        69\r\nhad sent written instructions to the Guards'[183] officers to keep the\r\nmen in hand. Thus the whole empire seemed to have fallen into\r\nVespasian's lap. The chief senators, the majority of the knights, and\r\nthe whole of the city garrison and the police came flocking to the\r\nhouse of Flavius Sabinus. There they heard the news of the popular\r\nenthusiasm for Vitellius and the threatening attitude of the German\r\nGuards.[184] But Sabinus had gone too far to draw back, and when he\r\nshowed hesitation, they all began to urge him to fight, each being\r\nafraid for his own safety if the Vitellians were to fall on them when\r\nthey were disunited and consequently weaker. However, as so often\r\nhappens on these occasions, every one offered to give advice but few\r\nto share the danger. While Sabinus' Body Guard were marching down by\r\nthe Fundane reservoir[185] they were attacked by some of the most\r\ndetermined Vitellians. The surprise was unpremeditated, but the\r\nVitellians got the best of an unimportant skirmish. In the panic\r\nSabinus chose what was at the moment the safest course, and occupied\r\nthe summit of the Capitol,[186] where his troops were joined by a few\r\nsenators and knights. It is not easy to record their names, since\r\nafter Vespasian's victory crowds of people claimed credit for this\r\nservice to the party. There were even some women who endured the\r\nsiege, the most famous of them being Verulana Gratilla, who had\r\nneither children nor relatives to attract her, but only her love of\r\ndanger.[187]\r\n\r\nThe Vitellians, who were investing them, kept a half-hearted watch,\r\nand Sabinus was thus enabled to send for his own children and his\r\nnephew Domitian at dead of night, dispatching a courier by an\r\nunguarded route to tell the Flavian generals that he and his men were\r\nunder siege, and would be in great straits unless they were rescued.\r\nAll night, indeed, he was quite unmolested, and could have escaped\r\nwith perfect safety. The Vitellian troops could face danger with\r\nspirit, but were much too careless in the task of keeping guard;\r\nbesides which a sudden storm of chilly rain interfered with their\r\nsight and hearing.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak, before the two sides commenced hostilities, Sabinus        70\r\nsent Cornelius Martialis, who had been a senior centurion, to\r\nVitellius with instructions to complain that the conditions were being\r\nviolated; that he had evidently made a mere empty show of abdication,\r\nmeant to deceive a number of eminent gentlemen. Else why had he gone\r\nfrom the meeting to his brother's house, which caught the eye from a\r\nconspicuous position overlooking the Forum, and not rather to his\r\nwife's on the Aventine. That was the proper course for a private\r\ncitizen, anxious to avoid all pretension to supreme authority. But no,\r\nVitellius had returned to the palace, the very stronghold of imperial\r\nmajesty. From there he had launched a column of armed men, who had\r\nstrewn with innocent dead the most crowded quarter of Rome, and even\r\nlaid violent hands upon the Capitol. As for Sabinus himself, the\r\nmessenger was to say, he was only a civilian, a mere member of the\r\nsenate. While the issue was being decided between Vespasian and\r\nVitellius by the engagement of legions, the capture of towns, the\r\ncapitulation of cohorts; even when the provinces of Spain, of Germany,\r\nof Britain, had risen in revolt; he, though Vespasian's brother, had\r\nstill remained faithful to his allegiance, until Vitellius, unasked,\r\nbegan to invite him to a conference. Peace and union, he was to remind\r\nhim, serve the interest of the losers, and only the reputation of the\r\nwinners. If Vitellius regretted their compact, he ought not to take\r\narms against Sabinus, whom he had treacherously deceived, and against\r\nVespasian's son, who was still a mere boy. What was the good of\r\nkilling one youth and one old man? He ought rather to march out\r\nagainst the legions and fight for the empire on the field. The result\r\nof the battle would decide all other questions.\r\n\r\nGreatly alarmed, Vitellius replied with a few words in which he tried\r\nto excuse himself and throw the blame on his soldiers. 'I am too\r\nunassuming,' he said, 'to cope with their overpowering impatience.' He\r\nthen warned Martialis to make his way out of the house by a secret\r\npassage, for fear that the soldiers should kill him as an ambassador\r\nof the peace to which they were so hostile. Vitellius himself was not\r\nin a position to issue orders or prohibitions; no longer an emperor,\r\nmerely an excuse for war.\r\n\r\nMartialis had hardly returned to the Capitol when the furious           71\r\nsoldiery arrived. They had no general to lead them: each was a law to\r\nhimself. Their column marched at full speed through the Forum and past\r\nthe temples overlooking it. Then in battle order they advanced up the\r\nsteep hill in front of them, until they reached the lowest gates of\r\nthe fortress on the Capitol. In old days there was a series of\r\ncolonnades at the side of this slope, on the right as you go up.\r\nEmerging on to the roof of these, the besieged overwhelmed the\r\nVitellians with showers of stones and tiles. The attacking party\r\ncarried nothing but swords, and it seemed a long business to send for\r\nsiege-engines and missiles. So they flung torches into the\r\nnearest[188] colonnade and, following in the wake of the flames, would\r\nhave burst through the burnt gates of the Capitol, if Sabinus had not\r\ntorn down all the available statues--the monuments of our ancestors'\r\nglory--and built a sort of barricade on the very threshold. They then\r\ntried to attack the Capitol by two opposite approaches, one near the\r\n'Grove of Refuge'[189] and the other by the hundred steps which lead\r\nup to the Tarpeian Rock. This double assault came as a surprise. That\r\nby the Refuge was the closer and more vigorous. Nothing could stop the\r\nVitellians, who climbed up by some contiguous houses built on to the\r\nside of the hill, which in the days of prolonged peace had been raised\r\nto such a height that their roofs were level with the floor of the\r\nCapitol. It is uncertain whether the buildings at this point were\r\nfired by the assailants or--as tradition prefers--by the besieged in\r\ntrying to dislodge their enemies who had struggled up so far. The fire\r\nspread to the colonnades adjoining the temples, and then the\r\n'eagles'[190] supporting the roof, which were made of very old wood,\r\ncaught the flames and fed them. And so the Capitol, with its doors\r\nfast shut, undefended and unplundered, was burnt to the ground.\r\n\r\nSince the foundation of the city no such deplorable and horrible        72\r\ndisaster had ever befallen the people of Rome. It was no case of\r\nforeign invasion. Had our own wickedness allowed, the country might\r\nhave been enjoying the blessings of a benign Providence; and yet here\r\nwas the seat of Jupiter Almighty--the temple solemnly founded by our\r\nancestors as the pledge of their imperial greatness, on which not even\r\nPorsenna,[191] when Rome surrendered, nor the Gauls, when they took\r\nit, had ever dared to lay rash hands--being brought utterly to ruin by\r\nthe mad folly of two rival emperors![192] The Capitol had been burnt\r\nbefore in civil war,[193] but that was the crime of private persons.\r\nNow it had been openly assaulted by the people of Rome and openly\r\nburnt by them. And what was the cause of war? what the recompense for\r\nsuch a disaster? Were we fighting for our country?\r\n\r\nKing Tarquinius Priscus had vowed to build this temple in the Sabine\r\nwar, and had laid the foundations on a scale that suited rather his\r\nhope of the city's future greatness than the still moderate fortunes\r\nof the Roman people. Later Servius Tullius, with the aid of Rome's\r\nallies, and Tarquinius Superbus, with the spoils of the Volscians\r\nafter the capture of Suessa Pometia,[194] continued the building. But\r\nthe glory of completing it was reserved for the days of freedom. After\r\nthe expulsion of the kings, Horatius Pulvillus, in his second\r\nconsulship[195] dedicated this monument on such a magnificent scale,\r\nthat in later days, with all her boundless wealth, Rome has been able\r\nto embellish but never to enlarge it. After an interval of four\r\nhundred and fifteen years, in the consulship of Lucius Scipio and\r\nCaius Norbanus,[196] it was burnt and rebuilt on the same site. Sulla\r\nafter his victory undertook the task of restoring it, but did not\r\ndedicate it. This only was lacking to justify his title of 'Fortune's\r\nFavourite'.[197] Much as the emperors did to it, the name of Lutatius\r\nCatulus[198] still remained upon it up to the time of Vitellius.[199]\r\nThis was the temple that was now ablaze.\r\n\r\nThe besieged suffered more panic than their assailants. The             73\r\nVitellian soldiers lacked neither resource nor steadiness in moments\r\nof crisis. But on the other side the troops were terrified, the\r\ngeneral[200] inert, and apparently so paralysed that he was\r\npractically deaf and dumb. He neither adopted others' plans nor formed\r\nany of his own, but only drifted about from place to place, attracted\r\nby the shouts of the enemy, contradicting all his own orders. The\r\nresult was what always happens in a hopeless disaster: everybody gave\r\norders and nobody obeyed them. At last they threw away their weapons\r\nand began to peer round for a way of escape or some means of hiding.\r\nThen the Vitellians came bursting in, and with fire and sword made one\r\nred havoc. A few good soldiers dared to show fight and were cut to\r\npieces. Of these the most notable were Cornelius Martialis,[201]\r\nAemilius Pacensis,[202] Casperius Niger, and Didius Scaeva. Flavius\r\nSabinus, who stood unarmed and making no attempt to escape, was\r\nsurrounded together with the consul Quintius Atticus,[203] whose empty\r\ntitle made him a marked man, as well as his personal vanity, which had\r\nled him to distribute manifestoes full of compliments to Vespasian and\r\ninsults against Vitellius. The rest escaped by various means. Some\r\ndisguised themselves as slaves: some were sheltered by faithful\r\ndependants: some hid among the baggage. Others again caught the\r\nVitellians' password, by which they recognized each other, and\r\nactually went about demanding it and giving it when challenged, thus\r\nescaping under a cloak of effrontery.\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy first broke in, Domitian had taken refuge with the       74\r\nsacristan, and was enabled by the ingenuity of a freedman to escape\r\namong a crowd of worshippers in a linen dress,[204] and to take refuge\r\nnear the Velabrum with Cornelius Primus, one of his father's\r\ndependants. When his father came to the throne, Domitian pulled down\r\nthe sacristan's lodging and built a little chapel to Jupiter the\r\nSaviour with an altar, on which his adventures were depicted in marble\r\nrelief. Later, when he became emperor, he dedicated a huge temple to\r\nJupiter the Guardian with a statue of himself in the lap of the god.\r\n\r\nSabinus and Atticus were loaded with chains and taken to Vitellius,\r\nwho received them without any language or looks of disfavour, much to\r\nthe chagrin of those who wanted to see them punished with death and\r\nthemselves rewarded for their successful labours. When those who stood\r\nnearest started an outcry, the dregs of the populace soon began to\r\ndemand Sabinus' execution with mingled threats and flatteries.\r\nVitellius came out on to the steps of the palace prepared to plead for\r\nhim: but they forced him to desist. Sabinus was stabbed and riddled\r\nwith wounds: his head was cut off and the trunk dragged away to         75\r\nthe Ladder of Sighs.[205] Such was the end of a man who certainly\r\nmerits no contempt. He had served his country for thirty-five years,\r\nand won credit both as civilian and soldier. His integrity and\r\nfairness were beyond criticism. He talked too much about himself, but\r\nthis is the one charge which rumour could hint against him in the\r\nseven years when he was Governor of Moesia, and the twelve years\r\nduring which he was Prefect of the City. At the end of his life some\r\nthought he showed a lack of enterprise, but many believed him a\r\nmoderate man, who was anxious to save his fellow citizens from\r\nbloodshed. In this, at any rate, all would agree, that before\r\nVespasian became emperor the reputation of his house rested on\r\nSabinus. It is said that Mucianus was delighted to hear of his murder,\r\nand many people maintained that it served the interests of peace by\r\nputting an end to the jealousy of two rivals, one of whom was the\r\nemperor's brother, while the other posed as his partner in the\r\nempire.[206]\r\n\r\nWhen the people further demanded the execution of the consul,\r\nVitellius withstood them. He had forgiven Atticus, and felt that he\r\nowed him a favour, for, when asked who had set fire to the Capitol,\r\nAtticus had taken the blame on himself, by which avowal--or was it a\r\nwell-timed falsehood?--he had fixed all the guilt and odium on himself\r\nand exonerated the Vitellian party.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [172] On the Palatine.\r\n\r\n    [173] See i. 8.\r\n\r\n    [174] A friend of Vitellius and the author of the historical\r\n          epic on the second Punic War.\r\n\r\n    [175] This apparently means that, if Vitellius were spared,\r\n          pity for his position would inspire his supporters to make\r\n          further trouble.\r\n\r\n    [176] See ii. 59.\r\n\r\n    [177] Two good points, but both untrue.\r\n\r\n    [178] This too is probably hyperbole, but Vespasian may have\r\n          owed his command in Germany to the influence of Vitellius'\r\n          father.\r\n\r\n    [179] See i. 52, note 99.\r\n\r\n    [180] See ii. 64, 89.\r\n\r\n    [181] See ii. 60.\r\n\r\n    [182] i.e. the way back from the Forum to the Palace.\r\n\r\n    [183] Including the city garrison and police.\r\n\r\n    [184] In chap. 78 we find three cohorts of Guards still\r\n          faithful to Vitellius, and, as it appears from ii. 93, 94 that\r\n          men from the legions of Germany had been enlisted in the\r\n          Guards, the term _Germanicae cohortes_ seems to refer to these\r\n          three cohorts, in which perhaps the majority were men from the\r\n          German army.\r\n\r\n    [185] Said to be on the Quirinal.\r\n\r\n    [186] Either the whole hill, or, if the expression is exact,\r\n          the south-west summit.\r\n\r\n    [187] This seems to have led her later into the paths of\r\n          conspiracy, for she is said to have been banished by Domitian\r\n          for her friendship with Arulenus Rusticus.\r\n\r\n    [188] _Prominentem_ seems to mean the one that projected\r\n          towards them.\r\n\r\n    [189] The space lying between the two peaks of the Capitoline.\r\n\r\n    [190] A technical term for the beams of the pediment.\r\n\r\n    [191] 'Lars Porsenna of Clusium,' 507 B.C.\r\n\r\n    [192] 'Burning the Capitol' was a proverb of utter iniquity.\r\n\r\n    [193] In the war between Sulla and Marius, 83 B.C.\r\n\r\n    [194] The capital town of the Volscians.

The gladiators were commanded, as we have already seen,[209] by\r\nJulianus, and the sailors by Apollinaris, men whose dissolute\r\ninefficiency better suited gladiators than general officers. They set\r\nno watch, and made no attempt to repair the weak places in the walls.\r\nDay and night they idled loosely; the soldiers were dispatched in all\r\ndirections to find them luxuries; that beautiful coast rang with their\r\nrevelry; and they only spoke of war in their cups. A few days earlier,\r\nApinius Tiro[210] had started on his mission, and, by rigorously\r\nrequisitioning gifts of money in all the country towns, was winning\r\nmore unpopularity than assistance for the cause.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, one of Vergilius Capito's slaves deserted to           77\r\nLucius Vitellius, and promised that, if he were provided with men, he\r\nwould put the abandoned castle into their hands. Accordingly, at dead\r\nof night he established a few lightly armed cohorts on the top of the\r\nhills which overlooked the enemy. Thence the soldiers came charging\r\ndown more to butchery than battle. They cut down their victims\r\nstanding helpless and unarmed or hunting for their weapons, or perhaps\r\nnewly startled from their sleep--all in a bewildering confusion of\r\ndarkness, panic, bugle-calls, and savage cries. A few of the\r\ngladiators resisted and sold their lives dearly. The rest rushed to\r\nthe ships; and there the same panic and confusion reigned, for the\r\nvillagers were all mixed up with the troops, and the Vitellians\r\nslaughtered them too, without distinction. Just as the first uproar\r\nbegan, six Liburnian cruisers slipped away with the admiral\r\nApollinaris on board. The rest were either captured on the beach or\r\noverweighted and sunk by the crowds that clambered over them. Julianus\r\nwas taken to Lucius Vitellius, who had him flogged till he bled and\r\nthen killed before his eyes. Some writers have accused Lucius\r\nVitellius' wife, Triaria,[211] of putting on a soldier's sword, and\r\nwith insolent cruelty showing herself among the horrors of the\r\ncaptured town. Lucius himself sent a laurel-wreath to his brother in\r\ntoken of his success, and inquired whether he wished him to return at\r\nonce or to continue reducing Campania. This delay saved not only\r\nVespasian's party but Rome as well. Had he marched on the city while\r\nhis men were fresh from their victory, with the flush of success added\r\nto their natural intrepidity, there would have been a tremendous\r\nstruggle, which must have involved the city's destruction. Lucius\r\nVitellius, too, for all his evil repute, was a man of action. Good men\r\nowe their power to their virtues; but he was one of that worst sort\r\nwhose vices are their only virtue.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [207] See chap. 58.\r\n\r\n    [208] An Italian goddess of freedom. The temple is mentioned\r\n          in Horace's _Journey to Brundisium_, where Anxur = Tarracina,\r\n          which was three miles from the temple.\r\n\r\n    [209] Chap. 57.\r\n\r\n    [210] He was in command of the rebels from the fleet at\r\n          Misenum, and engaged in bringing over the country-towns (see\r\n          chap. 57).\r\n\r\n    [211] Cp. chaps. 63 and 64.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SACK OF ROME AND THE END OF VITELLIUS\r\n\r\nWhile things[212] went thus on Vitellius' side, the Flavian army        78\r\nafter leaving Narnia spent the days of the Saturnalian holiday[213]\r\nquietly at Ocriculum.[214] The object of this disastrous delay was to\r\nwait for Mucianus. Antonius has been suspected of delaying\r\ntreacherously after receiving a secret communication from Vitellius,\r\noffering him as the price of treason the consulship, his young\r\ndaughter, and a rich dowry. Others hold that this story was invented\r\nto gratify Mucianus. Many consider that the policy of all the Flavian\r\ngenerals was rather to threaten the city than to attack it. They\r\nrealized that Vitellius had lost the best cohorts of his Guards, and\r\nnow that all his forces were cut off they expected he would abdicate.\r\nBut this prospect was spoilt first by Sabinus' precipitation and then\r\nby his cowardice, for, after very rashly taking arms, he failed to\r\ndefend against three cohorts of Guards the strongly fortified castle\r\non the Capitol, which ought to have been impregnable even to a large\r\narmy. However, it is not easy to assign to any one man the blame which\r\nthey all share. Even Mucianus helped to delay the victors' advance by\r\nthe ambiguity of his dispatches, and Antonius was also to blame for\r\nhis untimely compliance with instructions--or else for trying to throw\r\nthe responsibility[215] on Mucianus. The other generals thought the\r\nwar was over, and thus rendered its final scene all the more\r\nappalling. Petilius Cerialis was sent forward with a thousand cavalry\r\nto make his way by cross-roads through the Sabine country, and enter\r\nthe city by the Salarian road.[216] But even he failed to make\r\nsufficient haste, and at last the news of the siege of the Capitol\r\nbrought them all at once to their senses.\r\n\r\nMarching up the Flaminian road, it was already deep night when          79\r\nAntonius reached 'The Red Rocks'.[217] His help had come too late.\r\nThere he heard that Sabinus had been killed, and the Capitol burnt;\r\nthe city was in panic; everything looked black; even the populace and\r\nthe slaves were arming for Vitellius. Petilius Cerialis, too, had been\r\ndefeated in a cavalry engagement. He had pushed on without caution,\r\nthinking the enemy already beaten, and the Vitellians with a mixed\r\nforce of horse and foot had caught him unawares. The engagement had\r\ntaken place near the city among farm buildings and gardens and winding\r\nlanes, with which the Vitellians were familiar, while the Flavians\r\nwere terrified by their ignorance. Besides, the troopers were not all\r\nof one mind; some of them belonged to the force which had recently\r\nsurrendered at Narnia, and were waiting to see which side won. Julius\r\nFlavianus, who commanded a regiment of cavalry, was taken prisoner.\r\nThe rest fell into a disgraceful panic and fled, but the pursuit was\r\nnot continued beyond Fidenae.\r\n\r\nThis success served to increase the popular excitement. The city        80\r\nrabble now took arms. A few had service-shields: most of them snatched\r\nup any weapons they could find and clamoured to be given the sign for\r\nbattle. Vitellius expressed his gratitude to them and bade them sally\r\nforth to protect the city. He then summoned a meeting of the senate,\r\nat which envoys were appointed to go to the two armies and urge them\r\nin the name of public welfare to accept peace. The fortunes of the\r\nenvoys varied. Those who approached Petilius Cerialis found themselves\r\nin dire danger, for the soldiers indignantly refused their terms. The\r\npraetor, Arulenus Rusticus,[218] was wounded. Apart from the wrong\r\ndone to a praetor and an envoy, the man's own acknowledged worth made\r\nthis seem all the more scandalous. His companions were flogged, and\r\nthe lictor nearest to him was killed for venturing to make a way\r\nthrough the crowd. Indeed, if the guard provided by the general had\r\nnot intervened, a Roman envoy, the sanctity of whose person even\r\nforeign nations respect, might have been wickedly murdered in the mad\r\nrage of civil strife under the very walls of Rome. Those who went to\r\nAntonius met with a more reasonable reception; not that the soldiers\r\nwere less violent, but the general had more authority.\r\n\r\nA knight named Musonius Rufus had attached himself to the envoys.       81\r\nHe was a student of philosophy and an enthusiastic advocate of\r\nStoicism. He mingled with the armed soldiers offering them advice and\r\ndiscoursing on the advantages of peace and the perils of war. This\r\namused many of them and bored still more. Some, indeed, wanted to\r\nmaul him and kick him out, but the advice of the more sober spirits\r\nand the threats of others persuaded him to cut short his ill-timed\r\nlecture. The Vestal Virgins, too, came in procession to bring Antonius\r\na letter from Vitellius, in which he demanded one day's postponement\r\nof the final crisis, saying that everything could easily be settled,\r\nif only they would grant this respite. Antonius sent the Virgins away\r\nwith all respect, and wrote in answer to Vitellius that the murder of\r\nSabinus and the burning of the Capitol had broken off all\r\nnegotiations. However, he summoned the legions to a meeting and         82\r\nendeavoured to mollify them, proposing that they should pitch their\r\ncamp near the Mulvian Bridge and enter the city on the following day.\r\nHis motive for delay was a fear that the troops, when once their blood\r\nwas up after a skirmish, would have no respect for civilians or\r\nsenators, or even for the temples and shrines of the gods. But they\r\nsuspected every postponement as a hindrance to their victory.\r\nMoreover, some colours which were seen glittering along the hills,\r\ngave the impression of a hostile force, although none but peaceful\r\ncitizens accompanied them.\r\n\r\nThe attack was made in three columns. One advanced from its original\r\nposition on the Flaminian road, one kept near the bank of the Tiber,\r\nand the third approached the Colline Gate along the Salarian road. The\r\ncavalry rode into the mob and scattered them. But the Vitellian troops\r\nfaced the enemy, themselves, too, in three separate divisions. Again\r\nand again they engaged before the walls with varying success. But the\r\nFlavians had the advantage of being well led and thus more often won\r\nsuccess. Only one of the attacking parties suffered at all severely,\r\nthat which had made its way along narrow, greasy lanes to Sallust's\r\nGardens[219] on the left side of the city. Standing on the garden\r\nwalls, the Vitellians hurled stones and javelins down upon them and\r\nheld them back until late in the day. But at last the cavalry forced\r\nan entrance by the Colline Gate and took the defenders in the rear.\r\nThen the opposing forces met on the Martian Plain itself. Fortune\r\nfavoured the Flavians and the sense of victories won. The Vitellians\r\ncharged in sheer despair, but, though driven back, they gathered again\r\nin the city.\r\n\r\nThe people came and watched the fighting, cheering and applauding       83\r\nnow one side, now the other, like spectators at a gladiatorial\r\ncontest. Whenever one side gave ground, and the soldiers began to hide\r\nin shops or seek refuge in some private house, they clamoured for them\r\nto be dragged out and killed, and thus got the greater part of the\r\nplunder for themselves: for while the soldiers were busy with the\r\nbloody work of massacre, the spoil fell to the crowd. The scene\r\nthroughout the city was hideous and terrible: on the one side fighting\r\nand wounded men, on the other baths and restaurants: here lay heaps of\r\nbleeding dead, and close at hand were harlots and their\r\ncompanions--all the vice and licence of luxurious peace, and all the\r\ncrime and horror of a captured town. One might well have thought the\r\ncity mad with fury and mad with pleasure at the same time. Armies had\r\nfought in the city before this, twice when Sulla mastered Rome,[220]\r\nonce under Cinna.[221] Nor were there less horrors then. What was now\r\nso inhuman was the people's indifference. Not for one minute did they\r\ninterrupt the life of pleasure. The fighting was a new amusement for\r\ntheir holiday.[222] Caring nothing for either party, they enjoyed\r\nthemselves in riotous dissipation and took a frank pleasure in their\r\ncountry's disaster.\r\n\r\nThe storming of the Guards' camp was the most troublesome task. It      84\r\nwas still held by some of the bravest as a forlorn hope, which made\r\nthe victors all the more eager to take it, especially those who had\r\noriginally served in the Guards. They employed against it every means\r\never devised for the storming of the most strongly fortified towns, a\r\n'tortoise',[223] artillery, earthworks, firebrands. This, they cried,\r\nwas the crown of all the toil and danger they had undergone in all\r\ntheir battles. They had restored the city to the senate and people of\r\nRome, and their Temples to the gods: the soldier's pride is his camp,\r\nit is his country and his home. If they could not regain it at once,\r\nthey must spend the night in fighting. The Vitellians, for their part,\r\nhad numbers and fortune against them, but by marring their enemy's\r\nvictory, by postponing peace, by fouling houses and altars with their\r\nblood, they embraced the last consolations that the conquered can\r\nenjoy. Many lay more dead than alive on the towers and ramparts of the\r\nwalls and there expired. When the gates were torn down, the remainder\r\nfaced the conquerors in a body. And there they fell, every man of them\r\nfacing the enemy with all his wounds in front. Even as they died they\r\ntook care to make an honourable end.\r\n\r\nWhen the city was taken, Vitellius left the Palace by a back way and\r\nwas carried in a litter to his wife's house on the Aventine. If he\r\ncould lie hid during the day, he hoped to make his escape to his\r\nbrother and the Guards at Tarracina. But it is in the very nature of\r\nterror that, while any course looks dangerous, the present state of\r\nthings seems worst of all. His fickle determination soon changed and\r\nhe returned to the vast, deserted Palace, whence even the lowest of\r\nhis menials had fled, or at least avoided meeting him. Shuddering at\r\nthe solitude and hushed silence of the place, he wandered about,\r\ntrying closed doors, terrified to find the rooms empty; until at last,\r\nwearied with his miserable search, he crept into some shameful\r\nhiding-place. There Julius Placidus, an officer of the Guards, found\r\nhim and dragged him out. His hands were tied behind his back, his\r\nclothes were torn, and thus he was led forth--a loathly spectacle at\r\nwhich many hurled insults and no one shed a single tear of pity. The\r\nignominy of his end killed all compassion. On the way a soldier of the\r\nGerman army either aimed an angry blow at him, or tried to put him\r\nout of his shame, or meant, perhaps, to strike the officer in command;\r\nat any rate, he cut off the officer's ear and was immediately stabbed.\r\nWith the points of their swords they made Vitellius hold up his         85\r\nhead and face their insults, forcing him again and again to watch his\r\nown statues hurtling down, or to look at the Rostra and the spot where\r\nGalba had been killed. At last he was dragged along to the Ladder of\r\nSighs,[224] where the body of Flavius Sabinus had lain. One saying of\r\nhis which was recorded had a ring of true nobility. When some officer\r\nflung reproaches at him, he answered, 'And yet I was once your\r\nemperor.' After that he fell under a shower of wounds, and when he was\r\ndead the mob abused him as loudly as they had flattered him in his\r\nlifetime--and with as little reason.\r\n\r\nVitellius' home was at Luceria.[225] He was in his fifty-seventh        86\r\nyear, and had won the consulship, priesthoods, and a name and position\r\namong Rome's greatest men, all of which he owed to no efforts of his\r\nown, but solely to his father's eminence.[226] Those who offered him\r\nthe throne had not yet learnt to know him; and yet his slothful\r\ncowardice won from his soldiers an enthusiasm which the best of\r\ngenerals have rarely evoked. Still he had the qualities of candour and\r\ngenerosity, which without moderation are liable to prove disastrous.\r\nHe had few friends, though he bought many, thinking to keep them, not\r\nby showing moral stamina, but by giving liberal presents. It was\r\nindubitably good for the country that Vitellius should be beaten. But\r\nthose who betrayed him to Vespasian can hardly make a merit of their\r\nperfidy, for they were the very men who had deserted Galba for\r\nVitellius.\r\n\r\nThe day was already sinking into evening. The magistrates and senators\r\nhad fled in terror from the city, or were still in hiding at\r\ndependants' houses: it was therefore impossible to call a meeting of\r\nthe senate. When all fear of violence was at an end, Domitian came\r\nout[227] and presented himself to the generals of his party. The\r\ncrowds of soldiers at once hailed him as Caesar, and marched off,\r\nstill in full armour, to escort him to his father's house.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [212] The narrative is continued from chap. 63.\r\n\r\n    [213] December 17-23.\r\n\r\n    [214] Otricoli.\r\n\r\n    [215] i.e. for the delay which gave time for the burning of\r\n          the Capitol.

The streets were choked with\r\ncorpses; squares and temples ran with blood. Soon the riot knew no\r\nrestraint; they began to hunt for those who were in hiding and to drag\r\nthem out. All who were tall and of youthful appearance, whether\r\nsoldiers or civilians, were cut down indiscriminately.[228] While\r\ntheir rage was fresh they sated their savage cravings with blood; then\r\nsuddenly the instinct of greed prevailed. On the pretext of hunting\r\nfor hidden enemies, they would leave no door unopened and regard no\r\nprivacy. Thus they began to rifle private houses or else made\r\nresistance an excuse for murder. There were plenty of needy citizens,\r\ntoo, and of rascally slaves, who were perfectly ready to betray\r\nwealthy householders: others were indicated by their friends. From all\r\nsides came cries of mourning and misery. Rome was like a captured\r\ncity. People even longed to have the insolent soldiery of Otho and\r\nVitellius back again, much as they had been hated. The Flavian\r\ngenerals, who had fanned the flame of civil war with such energy, were\r\nincapable of using their victory temperately. In riot and disorder the\r\nworst characters take the lead; peace and quiet call for the highest\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nDomitian having secured the title and the official residence of a        2\r\nCaesar,[229] did not as yet busy himself with serious matters, but in\r\nhis character of emperor's son devoted himself to dissolute intrigues.\r\nArrius Varus[230] took command of the Guards, but the supreme\r\nauthority rested with Antonius Primus. He removed money and slaves\r\nfrom the emperor's house as though he were plundering Cremona. The\r\nother generals, from excess of modesty or lack of spirit, shared\r\nneither the distinctions of the war nor the profits of peace.\r\n\r\nPeople in Rome were now so nervous and so resigned to despotism that\r\nthey demanded that Lucius Vitellius and his force of Guards should be\r\nsurprised on their way back from Tarracina,[231] and the last sparks\r\nof the war stamped out. Some cavalry were sent forward to Aricia,\r\nwhile the column of the legions halted short of Bovillae.[232]\r\nVitellius, however, lost no time in surrendering himself and his\r\nGuards to the conqueror's discretion, and the men flung away their\r\nunlucky swords more in anger than in fear. The long line of prisoners\r\nfiled through the city between ranks of armed guards. None looked like\r\nbegging for mercy. With sad, set faces they remained sternly\r\nindifferent to the applause or the mockery of the ribald crowd. A few\r\ntried to break away, but were surrounded and overpowered. The rest\r\nwere put in prison. Not one of them gave vent to any unseemly\r\ncomplaint. Through all their misfortunes they preserved their\r\nreputation for courage. Lucius Vitellius was then executed. He was as\r\nweak as his brother, though during the principate he showed himself\r\nless indolent. Without sharing his brother's success, he was carried\r\naway on the flood of his disaster.\r\n\r\nAt this time Lucilius Bassus[233] was sent off with a force of           3\r\nlight horse to quell the disquiet in Campania, which was caused more\r\nby the mutual jealousy of the townships than by any opposition to the\r\nemperor. The sight of the soldiers restored order. The smaller\r\ncolonies were pardoned, but at Capua the Third legion[234] was left in\r\nwinter quarters and some of the leading families fined.[235]\r\nTarracina, on the other hand, received no relief. It is always easier\r\nto requite an injury than a service: gratitude is a burden, but\r\nrevenge is found to pay. Their only consolation was that one of\r\nVergilius Capito's slaves, who had, as we have seen,[236] betrayed\r\nthe town, was hanged on the gallows with the very rings[237] on his\r\nfingers which Vitellius had given him to wear.\r\n\r\nAt Rome the senate decreed to Vespasian all the usual prerogatives of\r\nthe principate.[238] They were now happy and confident. Seeing that\r\nthe civil war had broken out in the provinces of Gaul and Spain, and\r\nafter causing a rebellion first in Germany and then in Illyricum, had\r\nspread to Egypt, Judaea, Syria,[239] and in fact to all the provinces\r\nand armies of the empire, they felt that the world had been purged as\r\nby fire and that all was now over. Their satisfaction was still\r\nfurther enhanced by a letter from Vespasian, which at first sight\r\nseemed to be phrased as if the war was still going on. Still his tone\r\nwas that of an emperor, though he spoke of himself as a simple citizen\r\nand gave his country all the glory. The senate for its part showed no\r\nlack of deference. They decreed that Vespasian himself should be\r\nconsul with Titus for his colleague, and on Domitian they conferred\r\nthe praetorship with the powers of a consul.[240]\r\n\r\nMucianus had also addressed a letter to the senate which gave rise       4\r\nto a good deal of talk.[241] If he were a private citizen, why adopt\r\nthe official tone? He could have expressed the same opinions a few\r\ndays later from his place in the House. Besides, his attack on\r\nVitellius came too late to prove his independence, and what seemed\r\nparticularly humiliating for the country and insulting to the emperor\r\nwas his boast that he had held the empire in the hollow of his hand,\r\nand had given it to Vespasian. However, they concealed their ill-will\r\nand made a great show of flattery, decreeing to Mucianus in the most\r\ncomplimentary terms full triumphal honours, which were really given\r\nhim for his success against his fellow countrymen, though they trumped\r\nup an expedition to Sarmatia as a pretext.[242] On Antonius Primus\r\nthey conferred the insignia of the consulship, and those of the\r\npraetorship on Cornelius Fuscus and Arrius Varus. Then came the turn\r\nof the gods: it was decided to restore the Capitol. These proposals\r\nwere all moved by the consul-designate, Valerius Asiaticus.[243] The\r\nothers signified assent by smiling and holding up their hands, though\r\na few, who were particularly distinguished, or especially practised in\r\nthe art of flattery, delivered set speeches. When it came to the turn\r\nof Helvidius Priscus, the praetor-designate, he expressed himself in\r\nterms which, while doing honour to a good emperor, were perfectly\r\nfrank and honest.[244] The senate showed their keen approval, and it\r\nwas this day which first won for him great disfavour and great\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nSince I have had occasion to make a second allusion[245] to a man        5\r\nwhom I shall often have to mention again,[246] it may be well to give\r\nhere a brief account of his character and ideals, and of his fortune\r\nin life. Helvidius Priscus came from the country town of Cluviae.[247]\r\nHis father had been a senior centurion in the army. From his early\r\nyouth Helvidius devoted his great intellectual powers to the higher\r\nstudies, not as many people do, with the idea of using a philosopher's\r\nreputation as a cloak for indolence,[248] but rather to fortify\r\nhimself against the caprice of fortune when he entered public life. He\r\nbecame a follower of that school of philosophy[249] which holds that\r\nhonesty is the one good thing in life and sin the only evil, while\r\npower and rank and other such external things, not being qualities of\r\ncharacter, are neither good nor bad. He had risen no higher than the\r\nrank of quaestor when Paetus Thrasea chose him for his son-in-law,[250]\r\nand of Thrasea's virtues he absorbed none so much as his independence.\r\nAs citizen, senator, husband, son-in-law, friend, in every sphere of\r\nlife he was thoroughly consistent, always showing contempt for money,\r\nstubborn persistence in the right, and courage in the face of danger.\r\nSome people thought him too ambitious, for even with philosophers        6\r\nthe passion for fame is often their last rag of infirmity. After\r\nThrasea's fall Helvidius was banished, but he returned to Rome under\r\nGalba and proceeded to prosecute Eprius Marcellus,[251] who had\r\ninformed against his father-in-law. This attempt to secure a revenge,\r\nas bold as it was just, divided the senate into two parties, for the\r\nfall of Marcellus would involve the ruin of a whole army of similar\r\noffenders. At first the struggle was full of recrimination, as the\r\nfamous speeches on either side testify; but after a while, finding\r\nthat Galba's attitude was doubtful and that many of the senators\r\nbegged him to desist, Helvidius dropped the prosecution. On his action\r\nin this matter men's comments varied with their character, some\r\npraising his moderation, others asking what had become of his\r\ntenacity.\r\n\r\nTo return to the senate: at the same meeting at which they voted\r\npowers to Vespasian they also decided to send a deputation to address\r\nhim. This gave rise to a sharp dispute between Helvidius Priscus and\r\nEprius Marcellus. The former thought the members of the deputation\r\nought to be nominated by magistrates acting under oath; Marcellus\r\ndemanded their selection by lot. The consul-designate had already        7\r\nspoken in favour of the latter method, but Marcellus' motive was\r\npersonal vanity, for he was afraid that if others were chosen he\r\nwould seem slighted. Their exchange of views gradually grew into a\r\nformal and acrimonious debate. Helvidius inquired why it was that\r\nMarcellus was so afraid of the magistrates' judgement, seeing that he\r\nhimself had great advantages of wealth and of eloquence over many\r\nothers. Could it be the memory of his misdeeds that so oppressed him?\r\nThe fall of the lot could not discern character: but the whole point\r\nof submitting people to the vote and to scrutiny by the senate was to\r\nget at the truth about each man's life and reputation. In the interest\r\nof the country, and out of respect to Vespasian, it was important that\r\nhe should be met by men whom the senate considered beyond reproach,\r\nmen who would give the emperor a taste for honest language. Vespasian\r\nhad been a friend of Thrasea, Soranus, and Sentius,[252] and even\r\nthough there might be no need to punish their prosecutors, still it\r\nwould be wrong to put them forward. Moreover, the senate's selection\r\nwould be a sort of hint to the emperor whom to approve and whom to\r\navoid. 'Good friends are the most effective instruments of good\r\ngovernment. Marcellus ought to be content with having driven Nero to\r\ndestroy so many innocent people. Let him enjoy the impunity and the\r\nprofit he has won from that, and leave Vespasian to more honest\r\nadvisers.'\r\n\r\nMarcellus replied that the opinion which was being impugned was not      8\r\nhis own. The consul-designate had already advised them to follow the\r\nestablished precedent, which was that deputations should be chosen by\r\nlot, so that there should be no room for intrigue or personal\r\nanimosity. Nothing had happened to justify them in setting aside such\r\nan ancient system. Why turn a compliment to the emperor into a slight\r\nupon some one else? Anybody could do homage. What they had to avoid\r\nwas the possibility that some people's obstinacy might irritate the\r\nemperor at the outset of his reign, while his intentions were\r\nundecided and he was still busy watching faces and listening to what\r\nwas said. 'I have not forgotten,' he went on, 'the days of my youth or\r\nthe constitution which our fathers and grandfathers established.[253]\r\nBut while admiring a distant past, I support the existing state of\r\nthings. I pray for good emperors, but I take them as they come. As for\r\nThrasea, it was not my speech but the senate's verdict which did for\r\nhim. Nero took a savage delight in farces like that trial, and,\r\nreally, the friendship of such an emperor cost me as much anxiety as\r\nbanishment did to others. In fine, Helvidius may be as brave and as\r\nfirm as any Brutus or Cato; I am but a senator and we are all slaves\r\ntogether. Besides, I advise my friend not to try and get an upper hand\r\nwith our emperor or to force his tuition on a man of ripe years,[254]\r\nwho wears the insignia of a triumph and is the father of two grown\r\nsons. Bad rulers like absolute sovereignty, and even the best of them\r\nmust set some limit to their subjects' independence.'\r\n\r\nThis heated interchange of arguments found supporters for both views.\r\nThe party which wanted the deputies chosen by lot eventually\r\nprevailed, since even the moderates were anxious to observe the\r\nprecedent, and all the most prominent members tended to vote with\r\nthem, for fear of encountering ill-feeling if they were selected.\r\n\r\nThis dispute was followed by another. The Praetors, who in those         9\r\ndays administered the Treasury,[255] complained of the spread of\r\npoverty in the country and demanded some restriction of expenditure.\r\nThe consul-designate said that, as the undertaking would be so vast\r\nand the remedy so difficult, he was in favour of leaving it for the\r\nemperor. Helvidius maintained that it ought to be settled by the\r\nsenate's decision. When the consuls began to take each senator's\r\nopinion, Vulcacius Tertullinus, one of the tribunes, interposed his\r\nveto, on the ground that they could not decide such an important\r\nquestion in the emperor's absence. Helvidius had previously moved that\r\nthe Capitol should be restored at the public cost, and with the\r\nassistance of Vespasian. The moderates all passed over this suggestion\r\nin silence and soon forgot it, but there were others who took care to\r\nremember it.[256]\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Musonius Rufus[257] brought an action          10\r\nagainst Publius Celer on the ground that it was only by perjury that\r\nhe had secured the conviction of Soranus Barea.[258] It was felt that\r\nthis trial restarted the hue and cry against professional accusers.\r\nBut the defendant was a rascal of no importance who could not be\r\nsheltered, and, moreover, Barea's memory was sacred. Celer had set up\r\nas a teacher of philosophy and then committed perjury against his\r\npupil Barea, thus treacherously violating the very principles of\r\nfriendship which he professed to teach. The case was put down for the\r\nnext day's meeting.[259] But now that a taste for revenge was aroused,\r\npeople were all agog to see not so much Musonius and Publius as\r\nPriscus and Marcellus and the rest in court.\r\n\r\nThus the senate quarrelled; the defeated party nursed their             11\r\ngrievances; the winners had no power to enforce their will; law was in\r\nabeyance and the emperor absent. This state of things continued until\r\nMucianus arrived in Rome and took everything into his own hands. This\r\nshattered the supremacy of Antonius and Varus, for, though Mucianus\r\ntried to show a friendly face towards them, he was not very\r\nsuccessful in concealing his dislike. But the people of Rome, having\r\nacquired great skill in detecting strained relations, had already\r\ntransferred their allegiance. Mucianus was now the sole object of\r\ntheir flattering attentions. And he lived up to them. He surrounded\r\nhimself with an armed escort, and kept changing his house and gardens.\r\nHis display, his public appearances, the night-watch that guarded him,\r\nall showed that he had adopted the style of an emperor while forgoing\r\nthe title. The greatest alarm was aroused by his execution of\r\nCalpurnius Galerianus, a son of Caius Piso.[260] He had attempted no\r\ntreachery, but his distinguished name and handsome presence had made\r\nthe youth a subject of common talk, and the country was full of\r\nturbulent spirits who delighted in revolutionary rumours and idly\r\ntalked of his coming to the throne. Mucianus gave orders that he\r\nshould be arrested by a body of soldiers, and to avoid a conspicuous\r\nexecution in the heart of the city, they marched him forty miles along\r\nthe Appian road, where they severed his veins and let him bleed to\r\ndeath. Julius Priscus, who had commanded the Guards under Vitellius,\r\ncommitted suicide, more from shame than of necessity.

People alluded to the loss of armies, the\r\ncapture of the legions' winter quarters, the defection of the Gallic\r\nprovinces as matters of indifference. I must now go back and explain\r\nthe origin of this war, and of the widespread rebellion of foreign and\r\nallied tribes which now broke into flame.\r\n\r\nThe Batavi were once a tribe of the Chatti,[265] living on the further\r\nbank of the Rhine. But an outbreak of civil war had driven them across\r\nthe river, where they settled in a still unoccupied district on the\r\nfrontier of Gaul and also in the neighbouring island, enclosed on one\r\nside by the ocean and on the other three sides by the Rhine.[266]\r\nThere they fared better than most tribes who ally themselves to a\r\nstronger power. Their resources are still intact, and they have only\r\nto contribute men and arms for the imperial army.[267] After a long\r\ntraining in the German wars, they still further increased their\r\nreputation in Britain, where their troops had been sent, commanded\r\naccording to an ancient custom by some of the noblest chiefs. There\r\nstill remained behind in their own country a picked troop of horsemen\r\nwith a peculiar knack of swimming, which enabled them to make a\r\npractice[268] of crossing the Rhine with unbroken ranks without losing\r\ncontrol of their horses or their weapons.\r\n\r\nOf their chieftains two outshone the rest. These were Julius            13\r\nPaulus and Julius Civilis, both of royal stock. Paulus had been\r\nexecuted by Fonteius Capito on a false charge of rebellion.[269] On\r\nthe same occasion Civilis was sent in chains to Nero. Galba, however,\r\nset him free, and under Vitellius he again ran great risk of his life,\r\nwhen the army clamoured for his execution.[270] This gave him a motive\r\nfor hating Rome, and our misfortunes fed his hopes. He was, indeed,\r\nfar cleverer than most barbarians, and professed to be a second\r\nSertorius or Hannibal, because they all three had the same physical\r\ndefect.[271] He was afraid that if he openly rebelled against the\r\nRoman people they would treat him as an enemy, and march on him at\r\nonce, so he pretended to be a keen supporter of Vespasian's party.\r\nThis much was true, that Antonius Primus had written instructing him\r\nto divert the auxiliaries whom Vitellius had summoned, and to delay\r\nthe legions on the pretence of a rising in Germany. Moreover,\r\nHordeonius Flaccus[272] had given him the same advice in person, for\r\nFlaccus was inclined to support Vespasian and anxious for the safety\r\nof Rome, which was threatened with utter disaster, if the war were to\r\nbreak out afresh and all these thousands of troops come pouring into\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nHaving thus made up his mind to rebel, Civilis concealed in the         14\r\nmeantime his ulterior design, and while intending to guide his\r\nultimate policy by future events, proceeded to initiate the rising as\r\nfollows. The young Batavians were by Vitellius' orders being pressed\r\nfor service, and this burden was being rendered even more irksome than\r\nit need have been by the greed and depravity of the recruiting\r\nofficers. They took to enrolling elderly men and invalids so as to get\r\nbribes for excusing them: or, as most of the Batavi are tall and\r\ngood-looking in their youth, they would seize the handsomest boys for\r\nimmoral purposes. This caused bad feeling; an agitation was organized,\r\nand they were persuaded to refuse service. Accordingly, on the pretext\r\nof giving a banquet, Civilis summoned the chief nobles and the most\r\ndetermined of the tribesmen to a sacred grove. Then, when he saw them\r\nexcited by their revelry and the late hour of the night, he began to\r\nspeak of the glorious past of the Batavi and to enumerate the wrongs\r\nthey had suffered, the injustice and extortion and all the evils of\r\ntheir slavery. 'We are no longer treated,' he said, 'as we used to be,\r\nlike allies, but like menials and slaves. Why, we are never even\r\nvisited by an imperial Governor[273]--irksome though the insolence of\r\nhis staff would be. We are given over to prefects and centurions; and\r\nwhen these subordinates have had their fill of extortion and of\r\nbloodshed, they promptly find some one to replace them, and then there\r\nare new pockets to fill and new pretexts for plunder. Now conscription\r\nis upon us: children are to be torn from parents, brother from\r\nbrother, never, probably, to meet again. And yet the fortunes of Rome\r\nwere never more depressed. Their cantonments contain nothing but loot\r\nand a lot of old men. Lift up your eyes and look at them. There is\r\nnothing to fear from legions that only exist on paper.[274] And we are\r\nstrong. We have infantry and cavalry: the Germans are our kinsmen: the\r\nGauls share our ambition. Even the Romans will be grateful if we go to\r\nwar.[275] If we fail, we can claim credit for supporting Vespasian: if\r\nwe succeed, there will be no one to call us to account.'\r\n\r\nHis speech was received with great approval, and he at once bound       15\r\nthem all to union, using the barbarous ceremonies and strange oaths of\r\nhis country. They then sent to the Canninefates to join their\r\nenterprise. This tribe inhabits part of the Island,[276] and though\r\ninferior in numbers to the Batavi, they are of the same race and\r\nlanguage and the same courageous spirit. Civilis next sent secret\r\nmessages to win over the Batavian troops, which after serving as Roman\r\nauxiliaries in Britain had been sent, as we have already seen,[277] to\r\nGermany and were now stationed at Mainz.[278]\r\n\r\nOne of the Canninefates, Brinno by name, was a man of distinguished\r\nfamily and stubborn courage. His father had often ventured acts of\r\nhostility, and had with complete impunity shown his contempt for\r\nCaligula's farcical expedition.[279] To belong to such a family of\r\nrebels was in itself a recommendation. He was accordingly placed on a\r\nshield, swung up on the shoulders of his friends, and thus elected\r\nleader after the fashion of the tribe. Summoning to his aid the\r\nFrisii[280]--a tribe from beyond the Rhine--he fell upon two cohorts\r\nof auxiliaries whose camp lay close to the neighbouring shore.[281]\r\nThe attack was unexpected, and the troops, even if they had foreseen\r\nit, were not strong enough to offer resistance: so the camp was taken\r\nand looted. They then fell on the Roman camp-followers and traders,\r\nwho had gone off in all directions as if peace were assured. Finding\r\nthe forts now threatened with destruction, the Roman officers set fire\r\nto them, as they had no means of defence. All the troops with their\r\nstandards and colours retired in a body to the upper end of the\r\nisland, led by Aquilius, a senior centurion. But they were an army in\r\nname only, not in strength, for Vitellius had withdrawn all the\r\nefficient soldiers and had replaced them by a useless mob, who had\r\nbeen drawn from the neighbouring Nervian and German villages and were\r\nonly embarrassed by their armour.[282]\r\n\r\nCivilis thought it best to proceed by guile, and actually ventured      16\r\nto blame the Roman officers for abandoning the forts. He could, he\r\ntold them, with the cohort under his command, suppress the outbreak of\r\nthe Canninefates without their assistance: they could all go back to\r\ntheir winter-quarters. However, it was plain that some treachery\r\nunderlay his advice--it would be easier to crush the cohorts if they\r\nwere separated--and also that Civilis, not Brinno, was at the head of\r\nthis war. Evidence of this gradually leaked out, as the Germans loved\r\nwar too well to keep the secret for long. Finding his artifice\r\nunsuccessful, Civilis tried force instead, forming the Canninefates,\r\nFrisii and Batavi into three separate columns.[283] The Roman line\r\nfaced them in position near the Rhine bank.[284] They had brought\r\ntheir ships there after the burning of the forts, and these were now\r\nturned with their prows towards the enemy. Soon after the engagement\r\nbegan a Tungrian cohort deserted to Civilis, and the Romans were so\r\nstartled by this unexpected treachery that they were cut to pieces by\r\ntheir allies and their enemies combined. Similar treachery occurred in\r\nthe fleet. Some of the rowers, who were Batavians, feigning clumsiness\r\ntried to impede the sailors and marines in the performance of their\r\nfunctions, and after a while openly resisted them and turned the\r\nships' sterns towards the enemy's bank. Finally, they killed the\r\npilots and centurions who refused to join them, and thus all the\r\ntwenty-four ships of the flotilla either deserted to the enemy or were\r\ncaptured by them.\r\n\r\nThis victory made Civilis immediately famous and proved                 17\r\nsubsequently very useful. Having now got the ships and the weapons\r\nwhich they needed, he and his followers were enthusiastically\r\nproclaimed as champions of liberty throughout Germany and Gaul. The\r\nGerman provinces immediately sent envoys with offers of help, while\r\nCivilis endeavoured by diplomacy and by bribery to secure an alliance\r\nwith the Gauls. He sent back the auxiliary officers whom he had taken\r\nprisoner, each to his own tribe, and offered the cohorts the choice of\r\neither going home or remaining with him. Those who remained were given\r\nan honourable position in his army: and those who went home received\r\npresents out of the Roman spoil. At the same time Civilis talked to\r\nthem confidentially and reminded them of the miseries they had endured\r\nfor all these years, in which they had disguised their wretched\r\nslavery under the name of peace. 'The Batavi,' he would say, 'were\r\nexcused from taxation, and yet they have taken arms against the common\r\ntyrant. In the first engagement the Romans were routed and beaten.\r\nWhat if Gaul throws off the yoke? What forces are there left in Italy?\r\nIt is with the blood of provincials that their provinces are won.\r\nDon't think of the defeat of Vindex. Why, it was the Batavian cavalry\r\nwhich trampled on the Aedui and Arverni,[285] and there were Belgic\r\nauxiliaries in Verginius' force. The truth is that Gaul succumbed to\r\nher own armies. But now we are all united in one party, fortified,\r\nmoreover, by the military discipline which prevails in Roman camps:\r\nand we have on our side the veterans before whom Otho's legions lately\r\nbit the dust. Let Syria and Asia play the slave: the East is used to\r\ntyrants: but there are many still living in Gaul who were born before\r\nthe days of tribute.[286] Indeed, it is only the other day[287] that\r\nQuintilius Varus was killed, when slavery was driven out of Germany,\r\nand they brought into the field not the Emperor Vitellius but Caesar\r\nAugustus himself. Why, liberty is the natural prerogative even of dumb\r\nanimals: courage is the peculiar attribute of man. Heaven helps the\r\nbrave. Come, then, fall upon them while your hands are free and theirs\r\nare tied, while you are fresh and they are weary. Some of them are for\r\nVespasian, others for Vitellius; now is your chance to crush both\r\nparties at once.'\r\n\r\nCivilis thus had his eye on Gaul and Germany and aspired, had his       18\r\nproject prospered, to become king of two countries, one pre-eminent in\r\nwealth and the other in military strength.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [264] Cp. iii. 46.\r\n\r\n    [265] One of the greatest and most warlike of the German\r\n          tribes living in the modern Hessen-Nassau and Waldeck. Tacitus\r\n          describes them at length in his _Germania_.\r\n\r\n    [266] i.e. a stretch of land about sixty miles in length, from\r\n          Nymwegen to the Hook of Holland, enclosed by the diverging\r\n          mouths of the Rhine, the northern of which is now called the\r\n          Lek, the southern the Waal (in Tacitus' time Vahalis). The\r\n          name Betuwe is still applied to the eastern part of this\r\n          island.\r\n\r\n    [267] In the _Germania_ Tacitus says that, like weapons, they\r\n          are kept exclusively for use in war, and are spared the\r\n          indignity of taxation.\r\n\r\n    [268] Some such word as _peritus_ or _exercitus_ must be\r\n          supplied at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\n    [269] Probably during the revolt of Vindex.

Ritter's\r\n          alteration of _Germanorum_ to _Cugernorum_ is very probably\r\n          right. They lived about a dozen miles west of Vetera, and are\r\n          thus a likely recruiting-ground. They were of German origin,\r\n          so if _Germanorum_ is right, the reference will still be to\r\n          them and the Tungri and other German Settlements on the east\r\n          of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n    [283] See ii. 42, note 301. Here, however, it is not\r\n          improbable that the word _cuneus_ means a V-shaped formation.\r\n          Tacitus' phrase in _Germ._ 6 is generally taken to mean that\r\n          the Germans fought in wedge-formation. The separation of the\r\n          three tribes in three columns was also typical of German\r\n          tactics. The presence of kinsmen stimulated courage.\r\n\r\n    [284] Presumably at the eastern end of the island, near either\r\n          Nymwegen or Arnheim.\r\n\r\n    [285] The Aedui lived in Bourgogne and Nivernois, between the\r\n          Loire and the Saône; the Arverni in Auvergne, north-west of\r\n          the Cevennes. Both had joined Vindex.\r\n\r\n    [286] 'Many' must be an exaggeration, since Augustus' census\r\n          of Gaul took place 27 B.C., ninety-five years ago.\r\n\r\n    [287] Sixty years ago, to be exact.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUTINY OF THE BATAVIAN COHORTS\r\n\r\nHordeonius Flaccus at first furthered Civilis' schemes by shutting his\r\neyes to them. But when messengers kept arriving in panic with news\r\nthat a camp had been stormed, cohorts wiped out, and not a Roman left\r\nin the Batavian Island, he instructed Munius Lupercus, who commanded\r\nthe two legions[288] in winter-quarters,[289] to march against the\r\nenemy. Lupercus lost no time in crossing the river,[290] taking the\r\nlegions whom he had with him, some Ubii[291] who were close at hand,\r\nand the Treviran cavalry who were stationed not far away. To this\r\nforce he added a regiment of Batavian cavalry, who, though their\r\nloyalty had long ago succumbed, still concealed the fact, because they\r\nhoped their desertion would fetch a higher price, if they actually\r\nbetrayed the Romans on the field. Civilis set the standards of the\r\ndefeated cohorts[292] round him in a ring to keep their fresh honours\r\nbefore the eyes of his men, and to terrify the enemy by reminding them\r\nof their disaster. He also gave orders that his own mother and sisters\r\nand all the wives and small children of his soldiers should be\r\nstationed in the rear to spur them to victory or shame them if they\r\nwere beaten.[293] When his line raised their battle-cry, the men\r\nsinging and the women shrieking, the legions and their auxiliaries\r\nreplied with a comparatively feeble cheer, for their left wing had\r\nbeen exposed by the desertion of the Batavian cavalry, who promptly\r\nturned against us. However, despite the confusion, the legionaries\r\ngripped their swords and kept their places. Then the Ubian and\r\nTreviran auxiliaries broke in shameful flight and went wandering all\r\nover the country. The Germans pressed hard on their heels and\r\nmeanwhile the legions could make good their escape into the camp,\r\nwhich was called 'Castra Vetera'.[294] Claudius Labeo, who commanded\r\nthe Batavian cavalry, had opposed Civilis as a rival in some petty\r\nmunicipal dispute. Civilis was afraid that, if he killed him, he might\r\noffend his countrymen, while if he spared him his presence would give\r\nrise to dissension; so he sent him off by sea to the Frisii.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the cohorts of Batavians and                   19\r\nCanninefates, on their way to Rome under orders from Vitellius,\r\nreceived the message which Civilis had sent to them.[295] They\r\npromptly fell into a ferment of unruly insolence and demanded a\r\nspecial grant as payment for their journey, double pay, and an\r\nincrease in the number of their cavalry.[296] Although all these\r\nthings had been promised by Vitellius they had no hope of obtaining\r\nthem, but wanted an excuse for rebellion. Flaccus made many\r\nconcessions, but the only result was that they redoubled their vigour\r\nand demanded what they felt sure he would refuse. Paying no further\r\nheed to him they made for Lower Germany, to join Civilis. Flaccus\r\nsummoned the tribunes and centurions and debated with them whether he\r\nshould use force to punish this defiance of authority. After a while\r\nhe gave way to his natural cowardice and the fears of his\r\nsubordinates, who were distressed by the thought that the loyalty of\r\nthe auxiliaries was doubtful and that the legions had been recruited\r\nby a hurried levy. It was decided, therefore, to keep the soldiers in\r\ncamp.[297] However, he soon changed his mind when he found himself\r\ncriticized by the very men whose advice he had taken. He now seemed\r\nbent on pursuit, and wrote to Herennius Gallus in command of the First\r\nlegion, who was holding Bonn, telling him to bar the path of the\r\nBatavians, and promising that he and his army would follow hard upon\r\ntheir heels. The rebels might certainly have been crushed had Flaccus\r\nand Gallus each advanced their forces from opposite directions and\r\nthus surrounded them. But Flaccus soon gave up the idea, and wrote\r\nanother letter to Gallus, warning him to let the rebels pass\r\nundisturbed. This gave rise to a suspicion that the generals were\r\npurposely promoting the war; and all the disasters which had already\r\noccurred or were feared in the future, were attributed not to the\r\nsoldiers' inefficiency or the strength of the enemy, but to the\r\ntreachery of the generals.\r\n\r\nOn nearing the camp at Bonn, the Batavians sent forward a               20\r\nmessenger to explain their intentions to Herennius Gallus. Against the\r\nRomans, for whom they had fought so often, they had no wish to make\r\nwar: but they were worn out after a long and unprofitable term of\r\nservice and wanted to go home and rest. If no one opposed them they\r\nwould march peaceably by; but if hostility was offered they would find\r\na passage at the point of the sword. Gallus hesitated, but his men\r\ninduced him to risk an engagement. Three thousand legionaries, some\r\nhastily recruited Belgic auxiliaries, and a mob of peasants and\r\ncamp-followers, who were as cowardly in action as they were boastful\r\nbefore it, came pouring out simultaneously from all the gates, hoping\r\nwith their superior numbers to surround the Batavians. But these were\r\nexperienced veterans. They formed up into columns[298] in deep\r\nformation that defied assault on front, flank, or rear. They thus\r\npierced our thinner line. The Belgae giving way, the legion was driven\r\nback and ran in terror to reach the trench and the gates of the camp.\r\nIt was there that we suffered the heaviest losses. The trenches were\r\nfilled with dead, who were not all killed by the blows of the enemy,\r\nfor many were stifled in the press or perished on each other's swords.\r\nThe victorious cohorts avoided Cologne and marched on without\r\nattempting any further hostilities. For the battle at Bonn they\r\ncontinued to excuse themselves. They had asked for peace, they said,\r\nand when peace was persistently refused, had merely acted in\r\nself-defence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [288] V Alaudae and XV Primigenia, both depleted.\r\n\r\n    [289] At Vetera.\r\n\r\n    [290] Waal.\r\n\r\n    [291] They lived round their chief town, known since A.D. 50\r\n          as Colonia Agrippinensis, now Cologne (cp. i. 56, note 106).\r\n\r\n    [292] See chap. 16.\r\n\r\n    [293] This was a German custom.

But being still uncertain of his plans,\r\nand engaged in reckoning up the Roman forces, he made all who were\r\nwith him swear allegiance to Vespasian, and sent envoys to the two\r\nlegions, who after their defeat in the former engagement[299] had\r\nretired into Vetera, asking them to take the same oath. The answer\r\ncame back that they never followed the advice either of a traitor or\r\nof an enemy: Vitellius was their emperor, and they would keep their\r\nallegiance and their arms for him so long as they had breath in their\r\nbodies. A Batavian deserter need not try to decide the destiny of\r\nRome; he should rather expect the punishment he richly deserved. When\r\nthis was reported to Civilis he flew into a passion, and called the\r\nwhole Batavian people to take arms. They were joined by the Bructeri\r\nand Tencteri,[300] and Germany was summoned to come and share the\r\nplunder and the glory.\r\n\r\nThreatened with this gathering storm, Munius Lupercus and Numisius      22\r\nRufus, who were in command of the two legions, proceeded to strengthen\r\nthe ramparts and walls. They pulled down the buildings near the\r\nmilitary camp, which had grown into a small town during the long years\r\nof peace, fearing that the enemy might make use of them. But they\r\nomitted to provide a sufficient store of provisions for the camp, and\r\nauthorized the soldiers to make up the deficiency by looting, with the\r\nresult that what might have supplied their needs for a long time was\r\nconsumed in a few days. Meanwhile Civilis advanced, himself holding\r\nthe centre with the flower of the Batavi: on both banks of the Rhine\r\nhe massed large bands of Germans to strike terror into the enemy: the\r\ncavalry galloped through the fields, while the ships were\r\nsimultaneously moved up the stream. Here could be seen the colours of\r\nveteran Roman cohorts, there the figures of beasts which the Germans\r\nhad brought from their woods and groves, as their tribes do when they\r\ngo to battle. It seemed both a civil and a savage war at once; and\r\nthis strange confusion astounded the besieged. The hopes of the\r\nassailants rose when they saw the circumference of the ramparts, for\r\nthere were barely five thousand Roman soldiers to defend a camp which\r\nhad been laid out to hold two legions.[301] However, a large number of\r\ncamp-followers had collected there on the break-up of peace, and\r\nremained to give what assistance they could to the military\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe camp was built partly on the gentle slope of a hill and partly      23\r\non the level ground. Augustus had believed that it would serve as a\r\nbase of operations and a check upon the German tribes: as for their\r\nactually coming to assault our legions, such a disaster never\r\noccurred to him. Consequently no trouble had been taken in choosing\r\nthe site or erecting defences: the strength of the troops had always\r\nseemed sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe Batavians and the Germans from across the Rhine[302] now formed up\r\ntribe by tribe--the separation was designed to show their individual\r\nprowess--and opened fire from a distance. Finding that most of their\r\nmissiles fell harmlessly on to the turrets and pinnacles of the walls,\r\nand that they were being wounded by stones hurled from above, they\r\ncharged with a wild shout and surged up to the rampart, some using\r\nscaling-ladders, others climbing over their comrades who had formed a\r\n'tortoise'. But no sooner had some of them begun to scale the wall,\r\nthan they were hurled down by the besieged, who thrust at them with\r\nsword and shield, and buried under a shower of stakes and javelins.\r\nThe Germans are always impetuous at the beginning of an action and\r\nover-confident when they are winning; and on this occasion their greed\r\nfor plunder even steeled them to face difficulties. They actually\r\nattempted to use siege-engines, with which they were quite unfamiliar.\r\nBut though they had no skill themselves, some of the deserters and\r\nprisoners showed them how to build a sort of bridge or platform of\r\ntimber, on to which they fitted wheels and rolled it forward. Thus\r\nsome of them stood on this platform and fought as though from a mound,\r\nwhile others, concealed inside, tried to undermine the walls. However,\r\nstones hurled from catapults soon destroyed this rude engine. Then\r\nthey began to get ready hurdles and mantlets, but the besieged shot\r\nblazing spears on to them from engines, and even attacked the\r\nassailants themselves with fire-darts. At last they gave up all hope\r\nof an assault and resolved to try a waiting policy, being well aware\r\nthat the camp contained only a few days' provisions and a large number\r\nof non-combatants. They hoped that famine would breed treason, and\r\ncounted, besides, on the wavering loyalty of the slaves and the usual\r\nhazards of war to aid them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Flaccus,[303] who had received news of the siege of          24\r\nVetera, dispatched a party to recruit auxiliaries in Gaul, and gave\r\nDillius Vocula, in command of the Twenty-second, a force of picked\r\nsoldiers from his two legions.[304] Vocula was to hurry by forced\r\nmarches along the bank of the Rhine, while Flaccus himself was to\r\napproach by water, since he was in bad health and unpopular with his\r\nmen. Indeed, they grumbled openly that he had let the Batavian cohorts\r\nget away from Mainz, had connived at Civilis' schemes, and invited the\r\nGermans to join the alliance. Vespasian, they said, owed his rise more\r\nto Flaccus than to all the assistance of Antonius Primus or of\r\nMucianus, for overt hatred and hostility can be openly crushed, but\r\ntreachery and deceit cannot be detected, much less parried. While\r\nCivilis took the field himself and arranged his own fighting line,\r\nHordeonius lay on a couch in his bedroom and gave whatever orders\r\nbest suited the enemy's convenience. Why should all these companies\r\nof brave soldiers be commanded by one miserable old invalid? Let them\r\nrather kill the traitor and free their brave hearts and good hopes\r\nfrom the incubus of such an evil omen. Having worked on each other's\r\nfeelings by these complaints, they were still further incensed by the\r\narrival of a letter from Vespasian. As this could not be concealed,\r\nFlaccus read it before a meeting of the soldiers, and the messengers\r\nwho brought it were sent to Vitellius in chains.\r\n\r\nWith feelings thus appeased the army marched on to Bonn, the            25\r\nhead-quarters of the First legion. There the men were still more\r\nindignant with Flaccus, on whom they laid the blame of their recent\r\ndefeat.[305] It was by his orders, they argued, that they had taken\r\nthe field against the Batavians on the understanding that the legions\r\nfrom Mainz were in pursuit. But no reinforcements had arrived and his\r\ntreachery was responsible for their losses. The facts, moreover, were\r\nunknown to the other armies, nor was any report sent to their emperor,\r\nalthough this treacherous outbreak could have been nipped in the bud\r\nby the combined aid of all the provinces. In answer Flaccus read out\r\nto the army copies of all the letters which he had sent from time to\r\ntime all over Gaul and Britain and Spain to ask for assistance, and\r\nintroduced the disastrous practice of having all letters delivered to\r\nthe standard-bearers of the legions, who read them to the soldiers\r\nbefore the general had seen them. He then gave orders that one of the\r\nmutineers should be put in irons, more by way of vindicating his\r\nauthority than because one man was especially to blame. Leaving Bonn,\r\nthe army moved on to Cologne, where they were joined by large numbers\r\nof Gallic auxiliaries, who at first zealously supported the Roman\r\ncause: later, when the Germans prospered, most of the tribes took arms\r\nagainst us, actuated by hopes of liberty and an ambition to establish\r\nan empire of their own when once they had shaken off the yoke.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the army's indignation steadily increased. The imprisonment\r\nof a single soldier was not enough to terrify them, and, indeed, the\r\nprisoner actually accused the general of complicity in crime, alleging\r\nthat he himself had carried messages between Flaccus and Civilis. 'It\r\nis because I can testify to the truth,' he said, 'that Flaccus wants\r\nto get rid of me on a false charge.' Thereupon Vocula, with admirable\r\nself-possession, mounted the tribunal and, in spite of the man's\r\nprotestations, ordered him to be seized and led away to prison. This\r\nalarmed the disaffected, while the better sort obeyed him promptly.\r\nThe army then unanimously demanded that Vocula should lead them, and\r\nFlaccus accordingly resigned the chief command to him. However,         26\r\nthere was much to exasperate their disaffection. They were short both\r\nof pay and of provisions: the Gauls refused either to enlist or to pay\r\ntribute: drought, usually unknown in that climate, made the Rhine\r\nalmost too low for navigation, and thus hampered their commissariat:\r\npatrols had to be posted at intervals all along the bank to prevent\r\nthe Germans fording the river: and in consequence of all this they had\r\nless food and more mouths to eat it. To the ignorant the lowness of\r\nthe river seemed in itself an evil omen, as though the ancient\r\nbulwarks of the empire were now failing them. In peace they would have\r\ncalled it bad luck or the course of nature: now it was 'fate' and 'the\r\nanger of heaven'.\r\n\r\nOn entering Novaesium[306] they were joined by the Sixteenth legion.\r\nHerennius Gallus[307] now shared with Vocula the responsibility of\r\ncommand. As they could not venture out against the enemy, they\r\nencamped ... at a place called Gelduba,[308] where the soldiers were\r\ntrained in deploying, in fortification and entrenchment, and in\r\nvarious other military manoeuvres. To inspire their courage with the\r\nfurther incentive of plunder, Vocula led out part of the force against\r\nthe neighbouring tribe of the Cugerni,[309] who had accepted Civilis'\r\noffers of alliance. The rest of the troops were left behind with        27\r\nHerennius Gallus,[310] and it happened that a corn-ship with a full\r\ncargo, which had run aground close to the camp, was towed over by the\r\nGermans to their own bank. This was more than Gallus could tolerate,\r\nso he sent a cohort to the rescue. The number of the Germans soon\r\nincreased: both sides gradually gathered reinforcements and a regular\r\nbattle was fought, with the result that the Germans towed off the\r\nship, inflicting heavy losses. The defeated troops followed what had\r\nnow become their regular custom, and threw the blame not on their own\r\ninefficiency but on their commanding-officer's bad faith. They dragged\r\nhim from his quarters, tore his uniform and flogged him, bidding him\r\ntell them how much he had got for betraying the army, and who were his\r\naccomplices. Then their indignation recoiled on Hordeonius Flaccus: he\r\nwas the real criminal: Gallus was only his tool. At last their threats\r\nso terrified Gallus that he, too, charged Flaccus with treason. He was\r\nput in irons until the arrival of Vocula, who at once set him free,\r\nand on the next day had the ringleaders of the riot executed. The army\r\nshowed, indeed, a strange contrast in its equal readiness to mutiny\r\nand to submit to punishment. The common soldiers' loyalty to Vitellius\r\nwas beyond question,[311] while the higher ranks inclined towards\r\nVespasian. Thus we find a succession of outbreaks and penalties; an\r\nalternation of insubordination with obedience to discipline; for the\r\ntroops could be punished though not controlled.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the whole of Germany was ready to worship Civilis,            28\r\nsending him vast reinforcements and ratifying the alliance with\r\nhostages from their noblest families. He gave orders that the country\r\nof the Ubii and Treviri was to be laid waste by their nearest\r\nneighbours, and sent another party across the Maas to harass the\r\nMenapii and Morini[312] and other frontier tribes of Gaul. In both\r\nquarters they plundered freely, and were especially savage towards the\r\nUbii, because they were a tribe of German origin who had renounced\r\ntheir fatherland and adopted the name of Agrippinenses.[313] A Ubian\r\ncohort was cut to pieces at the village of Marcodurum,[314] where they\r\nwere off their guard, trusting to their distance from the Rhine. The\r\nUbii did not take this quietly, nor hesitate to seek reprisals from\r\nthe Germans, which they did at first with impunity. In the end,\r\nhowever, the Germans proved too much for them, and throughout the war\r\nthe Ubii were always more conspicuous for good faith than good\r\nfortune. Their collapse strengthened Civilis' position, and emboldened\r\nby success, he now vigorously pressed on the blockade of the legions\r\nat Vetera, and redoubled his vigilance to prevent any message creeping\r\nthrough from the relieving army. The Batavians were told off to look\r\nafter the engines and siege-works: the Germans, who clamoured for\r\nbattle, were sent to demolish the rampart and renew the fight directly\r\nthey were beaten off. There were so many of them that their losses\r\nmattered little.\r\n\r\nNightfall did not see the end of their task. They built huge fires      29\r\nof wood all round the ramparts and sat drinking by them; then, as the\r\nwine warmed their hearts, one by one they dashed into the fight with\r\nblind courage. In the darkness their missiles were ineffective, but\r\nthe barbarian troops were clearly visible to the Romans, and any one\r\nwhose daring or bright ornaments made him conspicuous at once became a\r\nmark for their aim. At last Civilis saw their mistake, and gave orders\r\nto extinguish the fires and plunge the whole scene into a confusion of\r\ndarkness and the din of arms. Discordant shouts now arose: everything\r\nwas vague and uncertain: no one could see to strike or to parry.\r\nWherever a shout was heard, they would wheel round and lunge in that\r\ndirection. Valour was useless: chance and chaos ruled supreme: and the\r\nbravest soldier often fell under a coward's bolt. The Germans fought\r\nwith blind fury. The Roman troops were more familiar with danger; they\r\nhurled down iron-clamped stakes and heavy stones with sure effect.\r\nWherever the sound of some one climbing or the clang of a\r\nscaling-ladder betrayed the presence of the enemy, they thrust them\r\nback with their shields and followed them with a shower of javelins.\r\nMany appeared on top of the walls, and these they stabbed with their\r\nshort swords. And so the night wore on. Day dawned upon new             30\r\nmethods of attack. The Batavians had built a wooden tower of two\r\nstories and moved it up to the Head-quarters Gate,[315] which was the\r\nmost accessible spot. However, our soldiers, by using strong poles and\r\nhurling wooden beams, soon battered it to pieces, with great loss of\r\nlife to those who were standing on it. While they were still dismayed\r\nat this, we made a sudden and successful sally. Meanwhile the\r\nlegionaries, with remarkable skill and ingenuity, invented still\r\nfurther contrivances. The one which caused most terror was a crane\r\nwith a movable arm suspended over their assailants' heads: this arm\r\nwas suddenly lowered, snatched up one or more of the enemy into the\r\nair before his fellows' eyes, and, as the heavy end was swung round,\r\ntossed him into the middle of the camp. Civilis now gave up hope of\r\nstorming the camp and renewed a leisurely blockade, trying all the\r\ntime by messages and offers of reward to undermine the loyalty of the\r\nlegions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [299] Chap. 18.\r\n\r\n    [300] The Bructeri lived between the Lippe and the Upper Ems,\r\n          the Tencteri along the eastern bank of the Rhine, between its\r\n          tributaries the Ruhr and the Sieg, i.e. opposite Cologne.\r\n\r\n    [301] i.e. about 12,000 men.

The troops\r\nwere variously affected by the news. The Gallic auxiliaries, who had\r\nno feelings of affection or dislike to either party and served without\r\nsentiment, promptly took the advice of their officers and deserted\r\nVitellius. The veterans hesitated; under pressure from Flaccus and\r\ntheir officers they eventually took the oath of allegiance, but it was\r\nclear from their faces that their hearts were not in it, and while\r\nrepeating the rest of the formula they boggled at the name of\r\nVespasian, either muttering it under their breath or more often\r\nomitting it altogether. Their suspicions were further inflamed          32\r\nwhen Antonius' letter to Civilis was read out before the meeting; it\r\nseemed to address Civilis as a member of the Flavian party, and to\r\nargue hostility to the German army. The news was next brought to the\r\ncamp at Gelduba, where it gave rise to the same comments and the same\r\nscenes. Montanus was sent to carry instructions to Civilis that he was\r\nto cease from hostilities and not to make war on Rome under a false\r\npretext; if it was to help Vespasian that he had taken arms, he had\r\nnow achieved his object. Civilis at first replied in guarded terms.\r\nThen, as he saw that Montanus was an impetuous person who would\r\nwelcome a revolution, he began to complain of all the dangers he had\r\nendured in the service of Rome for the last twenty-five years. 'A fine\r\nreward I have received,' he cried, 'for all my labours--my brother's\r\nexecution,[319] my own imprisonment,[319] and the bloodthirsty\r\nclamours of this army, from which I claim satisfaction by natural\r\nright since they have sought my destruction. As for you Trevirans and\r\nall the rest that have the souls of slaves, what reward do you hope\r\nto gain for shedding your blood so often in the cause of Rome, except\r\nthe thankless task of military service, endless taxation, and the rods\r\nand axes of these capricious tyrants? Look at me! I have only a single\r\ncohort under my command, and yet with the Canninefates and Batavi, a\r\nmere fraction of the Gallic peoples, I am engaged in destroying their\r\ngreat useless camp and besieging them with famine and the sword. In\r\nshort, our venture will either end in freedom or, if we are beaten, we\r\nshall be no worse off than before.' Having thus inflamed Montanus he\r\ntold him to take back a milder answer and dismissed him. On his return\r\nMontanus pretended that his errand had been fruitless, and said\r\nnothing about the rest of the interview: but it soon came to light.\r\n\r\nRetaining a portion of his force, Civilis sent the veteran cohorts      33\r\nwith the most efficient of the German troops against Vocula and his\r\narmy.[320] He gave the command to Julius Maximus and his nephew\r\nClaudius Victor. After rushing the winter-quarters of a cavalry\r\nregiment at Asciburgium[321] on their way, they fell upon the Roman\r\ncamp and so completely surprised it that Vocula had no time to address\r\nhis army or to form it for battle. The only precaution he could take\r\nin the general panic was to mass the legionaries in the centre with\r\nthe auxiliaries scattered on either flank. Our cavalry charged, but\r\nfound the enemy in good order ready to receive them, and came flying\r\nback on to their own infantry. What followed was more of a massacre\r\nthan a battle. The Nervian cohorts, either from panic or treachery,\r\nleft our flanks exposed; thus the legions had to bear the brunt. They\r\nhad already lost their standards and were being cut down in the\r\ntrenches, when a fresh reinforcement suddenly changed the fortune of\r\nthe fight. Some Basque auxiliaries,[322] originally levied by Galba,\r\nwho had now been summoned to the rescue, on nearing the camp heard the\r\nsound of fighting, and while the enemy were occupied, came charging in\r\non their rear. This caused more consternation than their numbers\r\nwarranted, the enemy taking them for the whole Roman force, either\r\nfrom Novaesium or from Mainz. This mistake encouraged the Roman\r\ntroops: their confidence in others brought confidence in themselves.\r\nThe best of the Batavians, at least of their infantry, fell. The\r\ncavalry made off with the standards and prisoners taken in the earlier\r\nstage of the battle. Though our losses that day were numerically\r\nlarger, they were unimportant, whereas the Germans lost their best\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nOn both sides the generals deserved defeat, and failed to make          34\r\ngood use of their success. Their fault was the same. Had Civilis\r\nfurnished the attacking column with more troops, they could never have\r\nbeen surrounded by such a small force, and having stormed the camp\r\nwould have destroyed it. Vocula, on the other hand, had not even set\r\nscouts to warn him of the enemy's approach, and consequently no sooner\r\nsallied out than he was beaten. Then, when he had won the victory, he\r\nshowed great lack of confidence, and wasted day after day before\r\nmoving against the enemy. If he had made haste to follow up his\r\nsuccess and struck at the enemy at once, he might have raised the\r\nsiege of Vetera at one blow.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Civilis had been playing upon the feelings of the besieged\r\nby pretending that the Romans had been defeated and success had\r\nfavoured his arms. The captured standards and colours were carried\r\nround the walls and the prisoners also displayed. One of these did a\r\nfamous deed of heroism. Shouting at the top of his voice, he revealed\r\nthe truth. The Germans at once struck him dead, which only served to\r\nconfirm his information. Soon, too, the besieged saw signs of harried\r\nfields and the smoke of burning farms, and began to realize that a\r\nvictorious army was approaching. When he was in sight of the camp\r\nVocula ordered his men to plant the standards and construct a trench\r\nand rampart round them: they were to deposit all their baggage there\r\nand fight unencumbered. This made them shout at the general to give\r\nthem the signal; and they had learnt to use threats too. Without even\r\ntaking time to form their line they started the battle, all tired as\r\nthey were, and in disorder. Civilis was ready waiting for them,\r\ntrusting quite as much to their mistakes as to the merits of his own\r\nmen. The Romans fought with varying fortune. All the most mutinous\r\nproved cowards: some, however, remembered their recent victory and\r\nstuck to their places, cutting down the enemy, and encouraging\r\nthemselves and their neighbours. When the battle was thus renewed,\r\nthey waved their hands and signalled to the besieged not to lose their\r\nopportunity. These were watching all that happened from the walls, and\r\nnow came bursting out at every gate. It chanced that at this point\r\nCivilis' horse fell and threw him; both armies believed the rumour\r\nthat he had been wounded and killed. This caused immense consternation\r\nto his army and immense encouragement to ours. However, Vocula failed\r\nto pursue them when they fled, and merely set about strengthening the\r\nrampart and turrets, apparently in fear of another blockade. His\r\nfrequent failure to make use of his victory gives colour to the\r\nsuspicion that he preferred war.[323]\r\n\r\nWhat chiefly distressed our troops was the lack of supplies. The        35\r\nbaggage-train of the legions was sent to Novaesium with a crowd of\r\nnon-combatants to fetch provisions thence by land, the enemy being now\r\nmasters of the river. The first convoy got through safely, while\r\nCivilis was recovering from his fall. But when he heard that a second\r\nforaging-party had been sent to Novaesium under guard of several\r\ncohorts, and that they were proceeding on their way with their arms\r\npiled in the wagons as if it was a time of perfect peace, few keeping\r\nto the standards and all wandering at will, he sent some men forward\r\nto hold the bridges and any places where the road was narrow, and then\r\nformed up and attacked. The battle was fought on a long straggling\r\nline, and the issue was still doubtful when nightfall broke it off.\r\nThe cohorts made their way through to Gelduba, where the camp remained\r\nas it was,[324] garrisoned by the soldiers who had been left behind\r\nthere. It was obvious what dangers the convoy would have to face on\r\nthe return journey; they would be heavily laden and had already lost\r\ntheir nerve. Vocula[325] accordingly added to his force a thousand\r\npicked men from the Fifth and Fifteenth legions who had been at Vetera\r\nduring the siege, all tough soldiers with a grievance against their\r\ngenerals. Against his orders, more than the thousand started with him,\r\nopenly complaining on the march that they would not put up with famine\r\nand the treachery of their generals any longer. On the other hand,\r\nthose who stayed behind grumbled that they were left to their fate now\r\nthat part of the garrison had been removed. Thus there was a double\r\nmutiny, one party calling Vocula back, the others refusing to return\r\nto camp.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Civilis laid siege to Vetera. Vocula retired to Gelduba,      36\r\nand thence to Novaesium, shortly afterwards winning a cavalry skirmish\r\njust outside Novaesium. The Roman soldiers, however, alike in success\r\nand in failure, were as eager as ever to make an end of their\r\ngenerals. Now that their numbers were swelled by the arrival of the\r\ndetachments from the Fifth and the Fifteenth[326] they demanded their\r\ndonative, having learnt that money had arrived from Vitellius. Without\r\nfurther delay Flaccus gave it to them in Vespasian's name, and this\r\ndid more than anything else to promote mutiny. They indulged in wild\r\ndissipation and met every night in drinking-parties, at which they\r\nrevived their old grudge against Hordeonius Flaccus. None of the\r\nofficers ventured to interfere with them--the darkness somehow\r\nobscured their sense of duty--and at last they dragged Flaccus out of\r\nbed and murdered him. They were preparing to do the same with Vocula,\r\nbut he narrowly escaped in the darkness, disguised as a slave.\r\nWhen the excitement subsided, their fears returned, and they sent       37\r\nletters round by centurions to all the Gallic communities, asking for\r\nreinforcements and money for the soldiers' pay.\r\n\r\nWithout a leader a mob is always rash, timorous, and inactive. On the\r\napproach of Civilis they hurriedly snatched up their arms, and then\r\nimmediately dropped them and took to flight. Misfortune now bred\r\ndisunion, and the army of the Upper Rhine[327] dissociated itself\r\nfrom the rest. However, they set up the statues of Vitellius again in\r\nthe camp and in the neighbouring Belgic villages, although by now\r\nVitellius was dead.[328] Soon the soldiers of the First, Fourth, and\r\nTwenty-second repented of their folly and rejoined Vocula. He made\r\nthem take a second oath of allegiance to Vespasian and led them off to\r\nraise the siege of Mainz. The besieging army, a combined force of\r\nChatti,[329] Usipi, and Mattiaci,[330] had already retired, having got\r\nsufficient loot and suffered some loss. Our troops surprised them\r\nwhile they were scattered along the road, and immediately attacked.\r\nMoreover, the Treviri had built a rampart and breastwork all along\r\ntheir frontier and fought the Germans again and again with heavy loss\r\nto both sides. Before long, however, they rebelled, and thus sullied\r\ntheir great services to the Roman people.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [316] The end of October, A.D. 69 (see iii. 30-34).\r\n\r\n    [317] Caecina, as consul, had probably while at Cremona issued\r\n          a manifesto in favour of joining the Flavian party.\r\n\r\n    [318] Cp. iii. 35.\r\n\r\n    [319] See chap. 13.\r\n\r\n    [320] At Gelduba (chap. 26).\r\n\r\n    [321] Asberg.\r\n\r\n    [322] From the north-east frontier of the Tarragona division\r\n          of Spain, of which Galba had been governor.

Apart from the real miseries of the moment, it\r\nwas plunged into a groundless panic on the rumour of a rebellion in\r\nAfrica, where Lucius Piso was supposed to be plotting a revolution.\r\nPiso, who was governor of the province, was far from being a\r\nfirebrand. But the severity of the winter delayed the corn-ships, and\r\nthe common people, accustomed to buy their bread day by day, whose\r\ninterest in politics was confined to the corn-supply, soon began to\r\nbelieve their fears that the coast of Africa was being blockaded and\r\nsupplies withheld. The Vitellians, who were still under the sway of\r\nparty spirit, fostered this rumour, and even the victorious party were\r\nnot entirely displeased at it, for none of their victories in the\r\ncivil war had satisfied their greed, and even foreign wars fell far\r\nshort of their ambition.\r\n\r\nOn the first of January the senate was convened by the Urban            39\r\nPraetor,[332] Julius Frontinus, and passed votes of thanks and\r\ncongratulation to the generals, armies, and foreign princes.[333]\r\nTettius Julianus,[334] who had left his legion when it went over to\r\nVespasian, was deprived of his praetorship, which was conferred upon\r\nPlotius Grypus.[335] Hormus[336] was raised to equestrian rank.\r\nFrontinus then resigned his praetorship and Caesar Domitian succeeded\r\nhim. His name now stood at the head of all dispatches and edicts, but\r\nthe real authority lay with Mucianus, although Domitian, following\r\nthe promptings of his friends and of his own desires, frequently\r\nasserted his independence. But Mucianus' chief cause of anxiety lay in\r\nAntonius Primus and Arrius Varus. The fame of their exploits was still\r\nfresh; the soldiers worshipped them; and they were popular in Rome,\r\nbecause they had used no violence off the field of battle. It was even\r\nhinted that Antonius had urged Crassus Scribonianus[337] to seize the\r\nthrone. He was a man who owed his distinction to famous ancestors and\r\nto his brother's memory, and Antonius could promise him adequate\r\nsupport for a conspiracy. However, Scribonianus refused. He had a\r\nterror of all risks, and would hardly have been seduced even by the\r\ncertainty of success. Being unable to crush Antonius openly, Mucianus\r\nshowered compliments on him in the senate and embarrassed him with\r\npromises, hinting at the governorship of Nearer Spain, which the\r\ndeparture of Cluvius Rufus[338] had left vacant. Meanwhile he lavished\r\nmilitary commands on Antonius' friends. Then, having filled his empty\r\nhead with ambitious hopes, he destroyed his influence at one stroke by\r\nmoving the Seventh legion,[339] which was passionately attached to\r\nAntonius, into winter-quarters. The Third, who were similarly devoted\r\nto Arrius Varus, were sent back to Syria,[340] and part of the army\r\nwas taken out to the war in Germany. Thus, on the removal of the\r\ndisturbing factors, the city could resume its normal life under the\r\nold regime of law and civil government.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his first appearance in the senate Domitian spoke a       40\r\nfew moderate sentences regretting the absence of his father and\r\nbrother. His behaviour was most proper, and, as his character was\r\nstill an unknown quantity, his blushes were taken for signs of\r\nmodesty.[341] He moved from the chair that all Galba's honours should\r\nbe restored, to which Curtius Montanus proposed an amendment that some\r\nrespect should also be paid to the memory of Piso. The senate approved\r\nboth proposals, though nothing was done about Piso. Next, various\r\ncommissions were appointed by lot to restore the spoils of war to the\r\nowners; to examine and affix the bronze tablets of laws, which in\r\ncourse of time had dropped off the walls; to revise the list of public\r\nholidays, which in these days of flattery had been disgracefully\r\ntampered with; and to introduce some economy into public expenditure.\r\nTettius Julianus was restored to his praetorship as soon as it was\r\ndiscovered that he had taken refuge with Vespasian: but Grypus was\r\nallowed to retain his rank.[342] It was then decided to resume the\r\nhearing of the case of Musonius Rufus against Publius Celer[343]\r\nPublius was convicted and the shade of Soranus satisfied. This strict\r\nverdict made the day memorable in the annals of Rome, and credit was\r\nalso due to private enterprise, for everybody felt that Musonius had\r\ndone his duty in bringing the action. On the other hand, Demetrius, a\r\nprofessor of Cynic philosophy, earned discredit for defending an\r\nobvious criminal[344] more for ostentatious motives than from honest\r\nconviction. As for Publius, courage and fluency alike failed him at\r\nthe critical moment. This trial was the signal for further reprisals\r\nagainst prosecutors. Junius Mauricus[345] accordingly petitioned\r\nDomitian that the senate might be allowed access to the minutes of the\r\nimperial cabinet, in order to find out who had applied for leave to\r\nbring a prosecution and against whom. The answer was that on such a\r\nquestion as this the emperor must be consulted. Accordingly, at         41\r\nthe instigation of its leading members, the senate framed an oath in\r\nthese words, 'I call heaven to witness that I have never countenanced\r\nany action prejudicial to any man's civil status, nor have I derived\r\nany profit or any office from the misfortune of any Roman citizen.'\r\nThe magistrates vied with each other in their haste to take this oath,\r\nand the other members did the same, when called upon to speak. Those\r\nwho had a guilty conscience were alarmed, and managed to alter the\r\nwording of the oath by various devices. The house meanwhile applauded\r\nevery sign of scruple, and protested against each case of perjury.\r\nThis kind of informal censure fell most severely on Sariolenus Vocula,\r\nNonius Attianus, and Cestius Severus, who were notorious as habitual\r\ninformers under Nero. Against Sariolenus there was also a fresh charge\r\nof having continued his practices with Vitellius. The members went on\r\nshaking their fists at him until he left the house. They next turned\r\non Paccius Africanus, trying to hound him out in the same way. He was\r\nsupposed to have suggested to Nero the murder of the two brothers\r\nScribonius,[346] who were famous for their friendship and their\r\nwealth. Africanus dared not admit his guilt, though he could not very\r\nwell deny it. So he swung round on Vibius Crispus,[347] who was\r\npestering him with questions, and tried to turn the tables by\r\nimplicating him in the charges which he could not rebut, thus shifting\r\nthe odium on to his accomplice.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Vipstanus Messala[348] gained a great reputation,      42\r\nboth for dutiful affection and for eloquence, by venturing to\r\nintercede for his brother Aquilius Regulus,[349] although he had not\r\nattained the senatorial age.[350] Regulus had fallen into great\r\ndisfavour for having brought about the ruin of the noble families of\r\nthe Crassi and of Orfitus. It was supposed that, though quite a young\r\nman, he had voluntarily undertaken the prosecution, not to escape any\r\ndanger which was threatening him, but from purely ambitious motives.\r\nCrassus' wife, Sulpicia Praetextata, and his four sons were anxious to\r\nsecure revenge if the senate would grant a trial. Messala therefore\r\nmade no attempt to defend the case or the accused, but tried to\r\nshelter his brother, and had already won over some of the senators.\r\nCurtius Montanus now attacked him in a savage speech, and even went so\r\nfar as to charge Regulus with having given money to Piso's murderer\r\nafter Galba's death, and with having bitten Piso's head.[351] 'That,'\r\nsaid he, 'Nero certainly did not compel you to do. You purchased\r\nneither position nor safety by that savage piece of cruelty. We may\r\nput up with the pleas of those wretches who prefer to ruin others\r\nrather than endanger their own lives. But your father's banishment had\r\nguaranteed your security. His property had been divided amongst his\r\ncreditors.[352] You were not of an age to stand for office. Nero had\r\nnothing either to hope or to fear from you. Your talents were as yet\r\nuntried and you had never exerted them in any man's defence, yet your\r\nlust for blood, your insatiable ambition, led you to stain your young\r\nhands in the blood of Rome's nobility. At one swoop you caused the\r\nruin of innocent youths, of old and distinguished statesmen, of\r\nhigh-born ladies; and out of the country's disaster you secured for\r\nyourself the spoils of two ex-consuls,[353] stuffed seven million\r\nsesterces into your purse, and shone with the reflected glory of a\r\npriesthood. You would blame Nero's lack of enterprise because he took\r\none household at a time, thus causing unnecessary fatigue to himself\r\nand his informers, when he might have ruined the whole senate at a\r\nsingle word. Why, gentlemen, you must indeed keep and preserve to\r\nyourselves a counsellor of such ready resource. Let each generation\r\nhave its good examples: and as our old men follow Eprius Marcellus or\r\nVibius Crispus, let the rising generation emulate Regulus. Villainy\r\nfinds followers even when it fails. What if it flourish and prosper?\r\nIf we hesitate to touch a mere ex-quaestor, shall we be any bolder\r\nwhen he has been praetor and consul? Or do you suppose that the race\r\nof tyrants came to an end in Nero? That is what the people believed\r\nwho outlived Tiberius or Caligula, and meanwhile there arose one more\r\ninfamous and more bloody still.[354] We are not afraid of Vespasian.\r\nWe trust his years and his natural moderation. But a good precedent\r\noutlives a good sovereign. Gentlemen, we are growing effete: we are no\r\nlonger that senate which, after Nero had been killed, clamoured for\r\nthe punishment of all informers and their menials according to our\r\nancestors' rigorous prescription. The best chance comes on the day\r\nafter the death of a bad emperor.'\r\n\r\nThe senate listened to Montanus's speech with such sympathy that        43\r\nHelvidius began to hope that it might be possible to get a verdict\r\neven against Marcellus. Beginning with a eulogy of Cluvius Rufus, who,\r\nthough quite as rich and as eloquent as Marcellus, had never brought\r\nany one into trouble under Nero, he went on to attack Marcellus, both\r\nby contrasting him with Rufus and by pressing home the charge against\r\nhim. Feeling that the house was warming to this rhetoric, Marcellus\r\ngot up as though to leave, exclaiming, 'I am off, Helvidius: I leave\r\nyou your senate: you can tyrannize over it under Caesar's nose.'\r\nVibius Crispus followed Marcellus, and, though both were angry, their\r\nexpressions were very different. Marcellus marched out with flashing\r\neyes, Crispus with a smile on his face. Eventually their friends went\r\nand brought them back. Thus the struggle grew more and more heated\r\nbetween a well-meaning majority and a small but powerful minority; and\r\nsince they were both animated by irreconcilable hatred, the day was\r\nspent in vain recriminations.\r\n\r\nAt the next sitting Domitian opened by recommending them to forget      44\r\ntheir grievances and grudges and the unavoidable exigences of the\r\nrecent past. Mucianus then at great length moved a motion in favour of\r\nthe prosecutors, issuing a mild warning, almost in terms of entreaty,\r\nto those who wanted to revive actions which had been begun and\r\ndropped. Seeing that their attempt at independence was being\r\nthwarted, the senate gave it up. However, that it might not seem as if\r\nthe senate's opinion had been flouted and complete impunity granted\r\nfor all crimes committed under Nero, Mucianus forced Octavius Sagitta\r\nand Antistius Sosianus, who had returned from exile, to go back to the\r\nislands to which they had been confined. Octavius had committed\r\nadultery with Pontia Postumina, and, on her refusal to marry him, had\r\nmurdered her in a fit of jealous fury. Sosianus was an unprincipled\r\nscoundrel who had been the ruin of many.[355] The senate had found\r\nthem both guilty, and passed a heavy sentence of exile, nor had their\r\npenalty been remitted, although others were allowed to return.\r\nHowever, this failed to allay the ill-feeling against Mucianus, for\r\nSosianus and Sagitta, whether they returned or not, were of no\r\nimportance, whereas people were afraid of the professional\r\nprosecutors, who were men of wealth and ability and experts in crime.\r\n\r\nUnanimity was gradually restored in the senate by the holding of a      45\r\ntrial according to ancient precedent, before a court of the whole\r\nhouse. A senator named Manlius Patruitus complained that he had been\r\nbeaten before a mob of people in the colony of Siena by order of the\r\nlocal magistrates. Nor had the affront stopped there. They had held a\r\nmock funeral before his eyes, and had accompanied their dirges and\r\nlamentations with gross insults levelled at the whole senate. The\r\naccused were summoned; their case was tried; they were convicted and\r\npunished. A further decree of the senate was passed admonishing the\r\ncommons of Siena to pay more respect to the laws. About the same time\r\nAntonius Flamma was prosecuted by Cyrene for extortion, and exiled for\r\nthe inhumanity of his conduct.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a mutiny almost broke out among the soldiers. The men        46\r\nwho had been discharged by Vitellius[356] came together again in\r\nsupport of Vespasian, and demanded re-admission. They were joined by\r\nthe selected legionaries who had also been led to hope for service in\r\nthe Guards, and they now demanded the pay they had been promised. Even\r\nthe Vitellians[357] alone could not have been dispersed without\r\nserious bloodshed, but it would require immense sums of money to\r\nretain the services of such a large number of men. Mucianus\r\naccordingly entered the barracks to make a careful estimate of each\r\nman's term of service. He formed up the victorious troops with their\r\nown arms and distinctive decorations, each company a few paces from\r\nthe next. Then the Vitellians who had surrendered, as we have\r\ndescribed, at Bovillae,[358] and all the other soldiers who had been\r\nhunted down in the city and its neighbourhood, were marched out almost\r\nentirely without arms or uniforms. Mucianus then had them sorted out,\r\nand drew up in separate corps the troops of the German army, of the\r\nBritish army, and of any others that were in Rome. Their first glance\r\nat the scene astounded them. Facing them they saw what looked like a\r\nfighting front bristling with weapons, while they were caught in a\r\ntrap, defenceless and foul with dirt. As soon as they began to be\r\nsorted out a panic seized them. The German troops in particular were\r\nterrified at their isolation, and felt they were being told off for\r\nslaughter. They embraced their comrades and clung upon their necks,\r\nasking for one last kiss, begging not to be left alone, crying out,\r\n'Our cause is the same as yours, why should our fate be different?'\r\nThey appealed now to Mucianus, now to the absent emperor, and lastly\r\nto the powers of Heaven, until Mucianus came to the rescue of their\r\nimaginary terrors by calling them all 'sworn servants of one emperor',\r\nfor he found that the victorious army was joining in and seconding\r\ntheir tears with cheering. On that day the matter ended there. A few\r\ndays later, when Domitian addressed them, they received him with\r\nrenewed confidence, refused his offer of lands, and begged for\r\nenlistment and their pay instead. This was only a petition, but one\r\nthat could not be refused: so they were admitted to the Guards.\r\nSubsequently, those who had grown old and completed the regular term\r\nof service[359] were honourably discharged. Others were dismissed for\r\nmisbehaviour, but one by one at different times, which is always the\r\nsafest method of weakening any kind of conspiracy.\r\n\r\nTo return to the senate; a bill was now passed that a loan of           47\r\nsixty million sesterces should be raised from private individuals and\r\nadministered by Pompeius Silvanus. This may have been a financial\r\nnecessity, or they may have wanted it to seem so. At any rate the\r\nnecessity soon ceased to exist, or else they gave up the pretence.\r\nDomitian then carried a proposal that the consulships conferred by\r\nVitellius should be cancelled, and that a state funeral should be held\r\nin honour of Flavius Sabinus.[360] Both proposals are striking\r\nevidence of the fickleness of human fortune, which so often makes the\r\nfirst last and the last first.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Lucius Piso,[361] the pro-consul of         48\r\nAfrica, was killed. To give a true explanation of this murder we must\r\ngo back and take a brief survey of certain matters which are closely\r\nconnected with the reasons for such crimes. Under the sainted Augustus\r\nand Tiberius the pro-consul of Africa had in his command one legion\r\nand some auxiliaries with which to guard the frontier of the\r\nempire.[362] Caligula, who was restless by nature and harboured\r\nsuspicions of the then pro-consul, Marcus Silanus, withdrew the\r\nlegion from his command and put it under a legate whom he sent out for\r\nthe purpose. As each had an equal amount of patronage and their\r\nfunctions overlapped, Caligula thus caused a state of friction which\r\nwas further aggravated by regrettable quarrels. The greater permanence\r\nof his tenure[363] gradually strengthened the legate's position, and\r\nperhaps an inferior is always anxious to vie with his betters. The\r\nmost eminent governors, on the other hand, were more careful of their\r\ncomfort than of their authority.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the legion in Africa was commanded by Valerius      49\r\nFestus,[364] an extravagant young man, immoderately ambitious, whose\r\nkinship with Vitellius had given him some anxiety. He had frequent\r\ninterviews with Piso, and it is impossible to tell whether he tempted\r\nPiso to rebel or resisted Piso's temptations. No one was present at\r\ntheir interviews, which were held in private, and after Piso's death\r\nmost people were inclined to sympathize with his murderer. Beyond\r\ndoubt the province and the garrison were unfavourable to Vespasian.\r\nBesides, some of the Vitellian refugees from Rome pointed out to Piso\r\nthat the Gallic provinces were wavering. Germany was ready to rebel,\r\nand he himself was in danger; 'and,' they added, 'if you earn\r\nsuspicion in peace your safest course is war.' Meanwhile, Claudius\r\nSagitta, who commanded Petra's Horse,[365] made a good crossing and\r\noutstripped the centurion Papirius, who had been sent out by Mucianus\r\nand was commissioned, so Sagitta affirmed, to assassinate Piso.\r\nSagitta further stated that Galerianus,[366] Piso's cousin and\r\nson-in-law, had already been murdered, and told him that while his one\r\nhope lay in taking a bold step, there were two courses open to him: he\r\nmight either take up arms on the spot, or he might prefer to sail to\r\nGaul and offer to lead the Vitellian armies. This made no impression\r\non Piso. When the centurion whom Mucianus had sent arrived at the\r\ngates of Carthage, he kept on shouting all sorts of congratulations to\r\nPiso on becoming emperor. The people he met, who were astounded at\r\nthis unexpected miracle, were instructed to take up the cry. With a\r\ncrowd's usual credulity, they rushed into the forum calling on Piso to\r\nappear, and as they had a passion for flattery and took no interest in\r\nthe truth, they proceeded to fill the whole place with a confused\r\nnoise of cheering. Piso, however, either at a hint from Sagitta, or\r\nfrom his natural good sense, would not show himself in public or give\r\nway to the excitement of the crowd. He examined the centurion, and\r\nlearnt that his object was to trump up a charge against him and then\r\nkill him.[367] He accordingly had the man executed more from\r\nindignation against the assassin than in any hope of saving his life;\r\nfor he found that the man had been one of the murderers of Clodius\r\nMacer,[368] and after staining his hand in the blood of a military\r\nofficer was now proposing to turn it against a civil governor. Piso\r\nthen reprimanded the Carthaginians in an edict which clearly showed\r\nhis anxiety, and refrained from performing even the routine of his\r\noffice, shutting himself up in his house, for fear that he might by\r\naccident provide some pretext for further demonstrations.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the popular excitement and the centurion's             50\r\nexecution reached the ears of Festus, considerably exaggerated and\r\nwith the usual admixture of falsehood, he at once sent off a party of\r\nhorsemen to murder Piso. Riding at full speed, they reached the\r\ngovernor's house in the twilight of early dawn and broke in with drawn\r\nswords. As Festus had mainly chosen Carthaginian auxiliaries and Moors\r\nto do the murder, most of them did not know Piso by sight. However,\r\nnear his bedroom they happened on a slave and asked him where Piso was\r\nand what he looked like. In answer the slave told them a heroic lie\r\nand said he was Piso, whereupon they immediately cut him down.\r\nHowever, Piso himself was killed very soon after, for there was one\r\nman among them who knew him, and that was Baebius Massa, one of the\r\nimperial agents in Africa, who was already a danger to all the best\r\nmen in Rome. His name will recur again and again in this narrative, as\r\none of the causes of the troubles which beset us later on.[369]\r\nFestus had been waiting at Adrumetum[370] to see how things went, and\r\nhe now hastened to rejoin his legion. He had the camp-prefect,\r\nCaetronius Pisanus, put in irons, alleging that he was one of Piso's\r\naccomplices, though his real motive was personal dislike. He then\r\npunished some of the soldiers and centurions and rewarded others; in\r\nneither case for their deserts, but because he wanted it to be thought\r\nthat he had stamped out a war. His next task was to settle the\r\ndifferences between Oea and Lepcis.[371] These had had a trivial\r\norigin in thefts of fruit and cattle by the peasants, but they were\r\nnow trying to settle them in open warfare. Oea, being inferior in\r\nnumbers, had called in the aid of the Garamantes,[372] an invincible\r\ntribe, who were always a fruitful source of damage to their\r\nneighbours. Thus the people of Lepcis were in great straits. Their\r\nfields had been wasted far and wide, and they had fled in terror under\r\nshelter of their walls, when the Roman auxiliaries, both horse and\r\nfoot, arrived on the scene. They routed the Garamantes and recovered\r\nall the booty, except what the nomads had already sold among the\r\ninaccessible hut-settlements of the far interior.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Cremona and the arrival of good news from           51\r\nevery quarter, Vespasian now heard of Vitellius' death. A large number\r\nof people of all classes, who were as lucky as they were adventurous,\r\nsuccessfully braved the winter seas on purpose to bring him the\r\nnews.[373] There also arrived envoys from King Vologaesus offering the\r\nservices of forty thousand Parthian cavalry.[374] It was, indeed, a\r\nproud and fortunate situation to be courted with such splendid offers\r\nof assistance, and to need none of them. Vologaesus was duly thanked\r\nand instructed to send his envoys to the senate and to understand that\r\npeace had been made. Vespasian now devoted his attention to the\r\naffairs of Italy and the Capitol, and received an unfavourable report\r\nof Domitian, who seemed to be trespassing beyond the natural sphere of\r\nan emperor's youthful son. He accordingly handed over the flower of\r\nhis army to Titus, who was to finish off the war with the Jews.[375]\r\n\r\nIt is said that before his departure Titus had a long talk with         52\r\nhis father and begged him not to be rash and lose his temper at these\r\nincriminating reports, but to meet his son in a forgiving and\r\nunprejudiced spirit, 'Neither legions nor fleets,' he is reported to\r\nhave said, 'are such sure bulwarks of the throne as a number of\r\nchildren. Time, chance and often, too, ambition and misunderstanding\r\nweaken, alienate or extinguish friendship: a man's own blood cannot be\r\nsevered from him; and above all is this the case with a sovereign,\r\nfor, while others enjoy his good fortune, his misfortunes only concern\r\nhis nearest kin. Nor again are brothers likely to remain good friends\r\nunless their father sets them an example.' These words had the effect\r\nof making Vespasian rather delighted at Titus' goodness of heart than\r\ninclined to forgive Domitian. 'You may ease your mind,' he said to\r\nTitus, 'It is now your duty to increase the prestige of Rome on the\r\nfield: I will concern myself with peace at home.' Though the weather\r\nwas still very rough, Vespasian at once launched his fastest\r\ncorn-ships with a full cargo. For the city was on the verge of\r\nfamine.[376] Indeed, there were not supplies for more than ten days in\r\nthe public granaries at the moment when Vespasian's convoy brought\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThe task of restoring the Capitol[377] was entrusted to Lucius          53\r\nVestinus, who, though only a knight, yet in reputation and influence\r\ncould rank with the highest. He summoned all the soothsayers,[378] and\r\nthey recommended that the ruins of the former temple should be carried\r\naway to the marshes[379] and a new temple erected on the same site:\r\nthe gods were unwilling, they said, that the original form of the\r\nbuilding should be changed. On the 21st of June, a day of bright\r\nsunshine, the whole consecrated area of the temple was decorated with\r\nchaplets and garlands. In marched soldiers, all men with names of good\r\nomen, carrying branches of lucky trees:[380] then came the Vestal\r\nVirgins accompanied by boys and girls, each of whom had father and\r\nmother alive,[381] and they cleansed it all by sprinkling fresh water\r\nfrom a spring or river.[382] Next, while the high priest, Plautius\r\nAelianus, dictated the proper formulae, Helvidius Priscus, the\r\npraetor, first consecrated the site by a solemn sacrifice[383] of a\r\npig, a sheep and an ox, and then duly offering the entrails on an\r\naltar of turf, he prayed to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, as the\r\nguardian deities of the empire, to prosper the enterprise, and by\r\ndivine grace to bring to completion this house of theirs which human\r\npiety had here begun. He then took hold of the chaplets to which the\r\nropes holding the foundation-stone were attached. At the same moment\r\nthe other magistrates and the priests and senators and knights and\r\nlarge numbers of the populace in joyous excitement with one great\r\neffort dragged the huge stone into its place. On every side gifts of\r\ngold and silver were flung into the foundations, and blocks of virgin\r\nore unscathed by any furnace, just as they had come from the womb of\r\nthe earth. For the soothsayers had given out that the building must\r\nnot be desecrated by the use of stone or gold that had been put to any\r\nother purpose. The height of the roof was raised. This was the only\r\nchange that religious scruples would allow, and it was felt to be the\r\nonly point in which the former temple lacked grandeur.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [331] We now reach the year A.D. 70.

All the other provinces\r\n          demanding military protection were under imperial control.\r\n          Caligula, without withdrawing the province from the senate, in\r\n          some degree regularized the anomaly by transferring this\r\n          command to a 'legate' of his own, technically inferior to the\r\n          civil governor.\r\n\r\n    [363] Whereas the pro-consul's appointment was for one year\r\n          only, the emperor's legate retained his post at the emperor's\r\n          pleasure, and was usually given several years.\r\n\r\n    [364] Cp. ii. 98.\r\n\r\n    [365] See i. 70.\r\n\r\n    [366] See chap. 11.\r\n\r\n    [367] i.e. he hoped that Piso would accept the story with\r\n          alacrity and thus commit himself.\r\n\r\n    [368] Cp. i. 7.\r\n\r\n    [369] Under Domitian he became one of the most notorious and\r\n          dreaded of informers. His name doubtless recurred in the lost\r\n          books of the Histories. But the only other extant mention of\r\n          him by Tacitus is in the life of Agricola (chap. 45).\r\n\r\n    [370] On the coast between Carthage and Thapsus.\r\n\r\n    [371] Tripoli and Lebda.\r\n\r\n    [372] Further inland; probably the modern Fezzan.\r\n\r\n    [373] Vespasian was still at Alexandria.\r\n\r\n    [374] Cp. ii. 82, note 410.\r\n\r\n    [375] Cp. ii. 4 and Book V.\r\n\r\n    [376] It had been Vespasian's original plan to starve Rome out\r\n          by holding the granaries of Egypt and Africa. See iii. 48.\r\n\r\n    [377] Cp. iii. 71.\r\n\r\n    [378] Probably from Etruria, where certain families were\r\n          credited with the requisite knowledge and skill. Claudius had\r\n          established a College of Soothsayers in Rome. They ranked\r\n          lower than the Augurs.\r\n\r\n    [379] At Ostia.\r\n\r\n    [380] Their names would suggest prosperity and success, e.g.\r\n          Salvius, Victor, Valerius, and they would carry branches of\r\n          oak, laurel, myrtle, or beech.\r\n\r\n    [381] This too was 'lucky' and a common ritualistic\r\n          requirement.\r\n\r\n    [382] The 'holy water' must come from certain streams of\r\n          special sanctity, such as the Tiber or its tributary, the\r\n          Almo. The water would be sprinkled from the 'lucky' branches.\r\n\r\n    [383] To the god Mars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOSS OF GERMANY\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,[384] the news of Vitellius' death had spread through         54\r\nGaul and Germany and redoubled the vigour of the war. Civilis now\r\ndropped all pretence and hurled himself upon the Roman Empire. The\r\nVitellian legions felt that even foreign slavery was preferable to\r\nowning Vespasian's sovereignty. The Gauls too had taken heart. A\r\nrumour had been spread that our winter camps in Moesia and Pannonia\r\nwere being blockaded by Sarmatians and Dacians:[385] similar stories\r\nwere fabricated about Britain: the Gauls began to think that the\r\nfortune of the Roman arms was the same all the world over. But above\r\nall, the burning of the Capitol led them to believe that the empire\r\nwas coming to an end. 'Once in old days the Gauls had captured Rome,\r\nbut her empire had stood firm since Jupiter's high-place was left\r\nunscathed. But now, so the Druids[386] with superstitious folly kept\r\ndinning into their ears, this fatal fire was a sign of Heaven's anger,\r\nand meant that the Transalpine tribes were destined now to rule the\r\nworld.' It was also persistently rumoured that the Gallic chieftains,\r\nwhom Otho had sent to work against Vitellius,[387] had agreed, before\r\nthey parted, that if Rome sank under its internal troubles in an\r\nunbroken sequence of civil wars, they would not fail the cause of the\r\nGallic freedom.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the murder of Hordeonius Flaccus[388] nothing had           55\r\nleaked out to arouse suspicions of a conspiracy, but when he had been\r\nassassinated, negotiations passed between Civilis and Classicus,[389]\r\nwho commanded the Treviran cavalry. Classicus was far above the rest\r\nboth in birth and in wealth. He came of royal line and his stock was\r\nfamous both in peace and war. It was his boast that his family had\r\ngiven Rome more enemies than allies. These two were now joined by\r\nJulius Tutor and Julius Sabinus, the one a Treviran, the other a\r\nLingonian. Tutor had been appointed by Vitellius to watch the bank of\r\nthe Rhine.[390] Sabinus' natural vanity was further inflamed by\r\nspurious pretensions of high birth, for he alleged that his\r\ngreat-grandmother's beauty had caught the fancy of Julius Caesar\r\nduring the campaign in Gaul, and that they had committed adultery.\r\nThese four tested the temper of the rest in private interviews, and\r\nhaving bound to the conspiracy those who were considered fit, they\r\nheld a conference at Cologne in a private house, the general feeling\r\nin the city being hostile to such plans as theirs. A few of the Ubii\r\nand Tungri, indeed, attended, but the Treviri and Lingonians were the\r\nbackbone of the conspiracy. Nor would they tolerate deliberation or\r\ndelay. They vied with each other in protesting that Rome was\r\ndistracted by internal quarrels; legions had been cut to pieces, Italy\r\ndevastated, the city was on the point of being taken, while all her\r\narmies were occupied with wars of their own in different quarters.\r\nThey need only garrison the Alps and then, when liberty had taken firm\r\nroot, they could discuss together what limit each tribe should set to\r\nits exercise of power.\r\n\r\nAll this was no sooner spoken than applauded. About the remnant of      56\r\nVitellius' army they were in some doubt. Many held that they ought to\r\nbe killed as being treacherous and insubordinate and stained with the\r\nblood of their generals. However, the idea of sparing them carried the\r\nday. To destroy all hope of pardon would only steel their obstinacy:\r\nit was much better to seduce them into alliance: only the generals\r\nneed be killed; a guilty conscience and the hope of pardon would soon\r\nbring the rest flocking over to their flag. Such was the tenor of\r\ntheir first meeting. Agitators were sent all over Gaul to stir up war.\r\nThe conspirators themselves feigned loyalty to Vocula, hoping to catch\r\nhim off his guard.[391] There were, indeed, traitors who reported all\r\nthis to Vocula, but he was not strong enough to crush the conspiracy,\r\nhis legions being short-handed and unreliable. Between suspected\r\ntroops on one side and secret enemies on the other, it seemed his best\r\ncourse under the circumstances to dissemble, as they were doing, and\r\nthus use their own weapons against them. So he marched down the river\r\nto Cologne. There he found Claudius Labeo, who after being taken\r\nprisoner, as described above,[392] and relegated to the Frisii, had\r\nbribed his guards and escaped to Cologne. He promised that if Vocula\r\nwould provide him with troops, he would go to the Batavi and win back\r\nthe better part of their community to the Roman alliance. He was given\r\na small force of horse and foot. Without venturing any attempt upon\r\nthe Batavi, he attracted a few of the Nervii and Baetasii[393] to his\r\nstandard, and proceeded to harass the Canninefates and Marsaci[393]\r\nmore by stealth than open warfare.\r\n\r\nLured by the treachery of the Gauls, Vocula marched out against         57\r\nhis enemy.[394] Not far from Vetera, Classicus and Tutor rode\r\nforward[395] on a pretext of scouting, and ratified their compact\r\nwith the German leaders. They were now for the first time separated\r\nfrom the legions, and entrenched themselves in a camp of their own. At\r\nthis, Vocula loudly protested that Rome was not as yet so shattered by\r\ncivil war as to earn the contempt of tribes like the Treviri and\r\nLingones. She could still rely on loyal provinces and victorious\r\narmies, on the good fortune of the empire and the avenging hand of\r\nGod. Thus it was that in former days Sacrovir and the Aedui,[396] more\r\nlately Vindex and the Gallic provinces had each been crushed at a\r\nsingle battle. Now, again, these treaty-breakers must expect to face\r\nthe same powers of Providence and Destiny. The sainted Julius and the\r\nsainted Augustus had understood these people better: it was Galba's\r\nreduction of the tribute[397] that had clothed them in enmity and\r\npride. 'They are our enemies to-day because their yoke is easy: when\r\nthey have been stripped and plundered they will be our friends.' After\r\nthese spirited words, seeing that Classicus and Tutor still persisted\r\nin their treachery, he turned back and retired to Novaesium, while the\r\nGauls encamped a couple of miles away. Thither the centurions and\r\nsoldiers flocked to sell their souls. This was, indeed, an unheard of\r\nvillainy that Roman soldiers should swear allegiance to a foreign\r\npower, and offer as a pledge for this heinous crime either to kill or\r\nimprison their generals. Though many urged Vocula to escape, he felt\r\nthat he must make a bold stand, so he summoned a meeting and spoke\r\nsomewhat as follows:--'Never before have I addressed you with such      58\r\nfeelings of anxiety for you, or with such indifference to my own fate.\r\nThat plans are being laid for my destruction I am glad enough to hear:\r\nin such a parlous case as this I look for death as the end of all my\r\ntroubles. It is for you that I feel shame and pity. It is not that a\r\nfield of battle awaits you, for that would only accord with the laws\r\nof warfare and the just rights of combatants, but because Classicus\r\nhopes that with your hands he can make war upon the Roman people, and\r\nflourishes before you an oath of allegiance to the Empire of All Gaul.\r\nWhat though fortune and courage have deserted us for the moment, have\r\nwe not glorious examples in the past? How often have not Roman\r\nsoldiers chosen to die rather than be driven from their post? Often\r\nhave our allies endured the destruction of their cities and given\r\nthemselves and their wives and children to the flames, without any\r\nother reward for such an end save the name of honourable men. At this\r\nvery moment Roman troops are enduring famine and siege at Vetera, and\r\nneither threats nor promises can move them, while we, besides arms and\r\nmen and fine fortifications, have supplies enough to last through any\r\nlength of war. Money, too--the other day there was enough even for a\r\ndonative, and whether you choose to say that it was given you by\r\nVespasian or by Vitellius, at any rate you got it from a Roman\r\nEmperor. After all the engagements you have won, after routing the\r\nenemy at Gelduba, at Vetera, it would be shameful enough to shirk\r\nbattle, but you have your trenches and your walls, and there are ways\r\nof gaining time until armies come flocking from the neighbouring\r\nprovinces to your rescue. Granted that you dislike me; well, there are\r\nothers to lead you, whether legate, tribune, centurion, and even\r\nprivate soldier. But do not let this portent be trumpeted over the\r\nwhole world, that Civilis and Classicus are going to invade Italy with\r\nyou in their train. Suppose the Germans and Gauls lead the way to the\r\nwalls of Rome, will you turn your arms upon your fatherland? The mere\r\nthought of such a crime is horrible. Will you stand sentry for the\r\nTreviran Tutor? Shall a Batavian give you the signal for battle? Will\r\nyou swell the ranks of German hordes? And what will be the issue of\r\nyour crime, when the Roman legions take the field against you?\r\nDesertion upon desertion, treachery upon treachery! You will be\r\ndrifting miserably between the old allegiance and the new, with the\r\ncurse of Heaven on your heads. Almighty Jupiter, whom we have\r\nworshipped at triumph after triumph for eight hundred and twenty\r\nyears; and Quirinus, Father of our Rome, if it be not your pleasure\r\nthat under my command this camp be kept clean from the stain of\r\ndishonour, grant at the least, I humbly beseech ye, that it never be\r\ndefiled with the pollution of a Tutor or a Classicus; and to these\r\nsoldiers of Rome give either innocence of heart or a speedy repentance\r\nbefore the harm is done.'\r\n\r\nThe speech was variously received, with feelings fluctuating            59\r\nbetween hope, fear, and shame. Vocula withdrew and began to prepare\r\nfor his end, but his freedmen and slaves prevented him from\r\nforestalling by his own hand a dreadful death. As it was, Classicus\r\ndispatched Aemilius Longinus, a deserter from the First legion, who\r\nquickly murdered him. For Herennius and Numisius imprisonment was\r\nthought sufficient. Classicus then assumed the uniform and insignia of\r\na Roman general, and thus entered the camp. Hardened though he was to\r\nevery kind of crime, words failed him,[398] and he could only read out\r\nthe oath. Those who were present swore allegiance to the Empire of All\r\nGaul. He then gave high promotion to Vocula's assassin, and rewarded\r\nthe others each according to the villainy of his service.\r\n\r\nThe command was now divided between Tutor and Classicus. Tutor at the\r\nhead of a strong force besieged Cologne and forced the inhabitants and\r\nall the soldiers on the Upper Rhine to take the same oath of\r\nallegiance. At Mainz he killed the officers and drove away the\r\ncamp-prefect, who had refused to swear. Classicus ordered all the\r\ngreatest scoundrels among the deserters to go to Vetera and offer\r\npardon to the besieged if they would yield to circumstances: otherwise\r\nthere was no hope for them: they should suffer famine and sword and\r\nevery extremity. The messengers further cited their own example.\r\n\r\nTorn by a conflict of loyalty and hunger, the besieged vacillated       60\r\nbetween honour and disgrace. While they hesitated, all their sources\r\nof food, both usual and unusual, began to fail them. They had eaten\r\ntheir mules and horses and all the other animals which, though foul\r\nand unclean, their straits had forced into use. At last they took to\r\ngrubbing up the shrubs and roots and the grass that grew between the\r\nstones, and became a very pattern of endurance in wretchedness, until\r\nat last they soiled their glory by a shameful end. Envoys were sent to\r\nCivilis begging him to save their lives. Even then he refused to\r\nreceive their petition until they had sworn allegiance to All Gaul. He\r\nthen negotiated for the plunder of the camp and sent guards, some to\r\nsecure the money, servants and baggage, and others to conduct the men\r\nthemselves out of the camp with empty hands. About five miles down the\r\nroad their line was surprised by an ambush of Germans. The bravest\r\nfell on the spot; many were cut down in flight; the rest got back to\r\ncamp. Civilis, indeed, complained that the Germans had criminally\r\nbroken faith and rebuked them for it. There is no evidence to show\r\nwhether this was a pretence or whether he was really unable to\r\nrestrain his savage troops. The camp was plundered and burnt, and all\r\nwho had survived the battle were devoured by the flames.\r\n\r\nWhen Civilis first took up arms against Rome he made a vow, such        61\r\nas is common with barbarians, to let his ruddled hair[399] grow wild;\r\nnow that he had at last accomplished the destruction of the legions he\r\nhad it cut. It is said also that he put up some of the prisoners for\r\nhis little son to shoot in sport with javelins and arrows. However\r\nthat may be, he did not himself swear allegiance to All Gaul, nor did\r\nhe force any of the Batavi to do so. He felt that he could rely on the\r\nstrength of the Germans, and that if any quarrel arose with the Gauls\r\nabout the empire, his fame would give him an advantage. Munius\r\nLupercus, one of the Roman commanding-officers, was sent among other\r\npresents to Veleda, a virgin of the Bructeran tribe who wielded a\r\nwide-spread authority.[400] It is an ancient custom in Germany to\r\ncredit a number of women with prophetic powers, and with the growth of\r\nsuperstition these develop into goddesses. At this moment Veleda's\r\ninfluence was at its height, for she had prophesied the success of the\r\nGermans and the destruction of the Roman army.[401] However, Lupercus\r\nwas killed on the journey. A few of the centurions and officers who\r\nhad been born in Gaul were detained as a security for good faith. The\r\nwinter camps of the legions and of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry\r\nwere all dismantled and burnt, with the sole exception of those at\r\nMainz and Vindonissa.[402]\r\n\r\nThe Sixteenth legion and the auxiliary troops who had surrendered       62\r\nwith it now received orders to migrate from their quarters at\r\nNovaesium to Trier, and a date was fixed by which they had to leave\r\ntheir camp. They spent the meantime brooding on various anxieties, the\r\ncowards all shuddering at the precedent of the massacre at Vetera, the\r\nbetter sort covered with shame at their disgrace. 'What sort of a\r\nmarch would this be? Whom would they have to lead them? Everything\r\nwould be decided by the will of those into whose hands they had put\r\ntheir lives.' Others, again, were quite indifferent to the disgrace,\r\nand simply stowed all their money and most cherished possessions about\r\ntheir persons, while many got their armour ready and buckled on their\r\nswords, as if for battle. While they were still busy with these\r\npreparations the hour struck for their departure, and it proved more\r\nbitter than they had expected. Inside the trenches their disgrace was\r\nnot so noticeable. The open country and the light of day revealed\r\ntheir depth of shame. The emperors' medallions had been torn down[403]\r\nand their standards desecrated, while Gallic ensigns glittered all\r\naround them. They marched in silence, like a long funeral procession,\r\nled by Claudius Sanctus,[404] a man whose sinister appearance--he had\r\nlost one eye--was only surpassed by his weakness of intellect. Their\r\ndisgrace was doubled when they were joined by the First legion, who\r\nhad left their camp at Bonn. The famous news of their capture had\r\nspread, and all the people who shortly before had trembled at the very\r\nname of Rome, now came flocking out from fields and houses, and\r\nscattered far and wide in transports of joy at this unwonted sight.\r\nTheir insulting glee was too much for 'The Picenum Horse'.[405]\r\nDefying all Sanctus' threats and promises, they turned off to Mainz,\r\nand coming by chance upon Longinus, the man who killed Vocula, they\r\nslew him with a shower of javelins and thus made a beginning of future\r\namends. The legions, without changing their route, came and camped\r\nbefore the walls of Trier.\r\n\r\nHighly elated by their success, Civilis and Classicus debated           63\r\nwhether they should allow their troops to sack Cologne. Their natural\r\nsavagery and lust for plunder inclined them to destroy the town, but\r\npolicy forbade; and they felt that in inaugurating a new empire a\r\nreputation for clemency would be an asset. Civilis was also moved by\r\nthe memory of a past service, for at the beginning of the outbreak his\r\nson had been arrested in Cologne, and they had kept him in honourable\r\ncustody. However, the tribes across the Rhine were jealous of this\r\nrich and rising community, and held that the war could only be ended\r\neither by throwing the settlement open to all Germans without\r\ndistinction or by destroying it and thereby dispersing the Ubii         64\r\ntogether with its other inhabitants.[406] Accordingly the\r\nTencteri,[407] their nearest neighbours across the Rhine, dispatched a\r\ndeputation to lay a message before a public meeting of the town. This\r\nwas delivered by the haughtiest of the delegates in some such terms as\r\nthese:--'We give thanks to the national gods of Germany and above all\r\nothers, to the god of war, that you are again incorporate in the\r\nGerman nation and the German name, and we congratulate you that you\r\nwill now at last become free members of a free community. Until to-day\r\nthe Romans had closed to us the roads and rivers, and almost the very\r\nair of heaven, to prevent all intercourse between us; or else they\r\noffered a still fouler insult to born warriors, that we should meet\r\nunder supervision, unarmed and almost naked,[408] and should pay for\r\nthe privilege. Now, that our friendly alliance may be ratified for all\r\neternity, we demand of you that you pull down those bulwarks of\r\nslavery, the walls of your town, for even wild beasts lose their\r\nspirit if you keep them caged: that you put to the sword every Roman\r\non your soil, since tyrants are incompatible with freedom; that all\r\nthe property of those killed form a common stock and no one be\r\nallowed to conceal anything or to secure any private advantage. It\r\nmust also be open both for us and for you to live on either\r\nriver-bank, as our forefathers could in earlier days. As daylight is\r\nthe natural heritage of all mankind, so the land of the world is free\r\nto all brave men. Resume again the customs and manners of your own\r\ncountry and throw off those luxurious habits which enslave Rome's\r\nsubjects far more effectively than Roman arms. Then, grown simple and\r\nuncorrupt, you will forget your past slavery and either know none but\r\nequals or hold empire over others.'\r\n\r\nThe townspeople took time to consider these proposals, and,             65\r\nfeeling that their apprehensions for the future forbade them to\r\nassent, while their present circumstances forbade them to return a\r\nplain negative, they answered as follows: 'We have seized our first\r\nopportunity of freedom with more haste than prudence, because we\r\nwanted to join hands with you and all our other German kinsmen. As for\r\nour town-walls, seeing that the Roman armies are massing at this\r\nmoment, it would be safer for us to heighten them than to pull them\r\ndown. All the foreigners from Italy or the provinces who lived on our\r\nsoil have either perished in the war or fled to their own homes. As\r\nfor the original settlers[409], who are united to us by ties of\r\nmarriage, they and their offspring regard this as their home, and we\r\ndo not think you are so unreasonable as to ask us to kill our parents\r\nand brothers and children. All taxes and commercial restrictions we\r\nremit. We grant you free entry without supervision, but you must come\r\nin daylight and unarmed, while these ties which are still strange and\r\nnew are growing into a long-established custom. As arbitrators we will\r\nappoint Civilis and Veleda, and we will ratify our compact in their\r\npresence.'\r\n\r\nThus the Tencteri were pacified. A deputation was sent with presents\r\nto Civilis and Veleda, and obtained all that the people of Cologne\r\ndesired. They were not, however, allowed to approach and speak to\r\nVeleda or even to see her, but were kept at a distance to inspire in\r\nthem the greater awe. She herself lived at the top of a high tower,\r\nand one of her relatives was appointed to carry all the questions and\r\nanswers like a mediator between God and man.\r\n\r\nNow that he had gained the accession of Cologne, Civilis                66\r\ndetermined to win over the neighbouring communities or to declare war\r\nin case of opposition. He reduced the Sunuci[410] and formed their\r\nfighting strength into cohorts, but then found his advance barred by\r\nClaudius Labeo[411] at the head of a hastily-recruited band of\r\nBaetasii, Tungri, and Nervii.[411] He had secured the bridge over the\r\nMaas and relied on the strength of his position. A skirmish in the\r\nnarrow defile proved indecisive, until the Germans swam across and\r\ntook Labeo in the rear. At this point Civilis by a bold move--or\r\npossibly by arrangement--rode into the lines of the Tungri and called\r\nout in a loud voice, 'Our object in taking up arms is not to secure\r\nempire for the Batavi and Treviri over other tribes. We are far from\r\nany such arrogance. Take us as allies. I am come to join you; whether\r\nas general or as private it is for you to choose.' This had a great\r\neffect on the common soldiers, who began to sheathe their swords. Then\r\ntwo of their chieftains, Campanus and Juvenalis, surrendered the\r\nentire tribe. Labeo escaped before he was surrounded. Civilis also\r\nreceived the allegiance of the Baetasii and Nervii, and added their\r\nforces to his own. His power was now immense, for all the Gallic\r\ncommunities were either terrified or ready to offer willing support.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Julius Sabinus,[412] who had destroyed every           67\r\nmemorial of the Roman alliance,[413] assumed the title of Caesar and\r\nproceeded to hurry a large unwieldy horde of his tribesmen against the\r\nSequani,[414] a neighbouring community, faithful to Rome. The Sequani\r\naccepted battle: the good cause prospered: the Lingones were routed.\r\nSabinus fled the field with the same rash haste with which he had\r\nplunged into battle. Wishing to spread a rumour of his death, he took\r\nrefuge in a house and set fire to it, and was thus supposed to have\r\nperished by his own act. We shall, however, relate in due course the\r\ndevices by which he lay in hiding and prolonged his life for nine\r\nmore years, and allude also to the loyalty of his friends and the\r\nmemorable example set by his wife Epponina.[415]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [384] Tacitus here resumes the thread of his narrative of the\r\n          rebellion on the Rhine, interrupted at the end of chap. 37,\r\n          and goes back from July to January, A.D. 70.\r\n\r\n    [385] Cp. iii. 46.\r\n\r\n    [386] The danger of Druidism was always before the eyes of the\r\n          emperors. Augustus had forbidden Roman citizens to adopt it.\r\n          Claudius had tried to stamp it out in Gaul and in Britain, yet\r\n          they appear again here to preach a fanatic nationalism.\r\n          However, this seems to be their last appearance as leaders of\r\n          revolt.\r\n\r\n    [387] Probably they were in Rome, and were sent back to their\r\n          homes to intrigue against Vitellius' rising power.\r\n\r\n    [388] See chap. 36.\r\n\r\n    [389] Cp. ii. 14.\r\n\r\n    [390] i.e. he was to prevent any incursions from Germany along\r\n          the frontier of his canton, between Bingen and Coblenz.\r\n\r\n    [391] At Mainz.\r\n\r\n    [392] Chap. 18.\r\n\r\n    [393] These tribes lived between the Maas and the Scheldt, and\r\n          the Marsaci were round the mouth of the Scheldt.\r\n\r\n    [394] Civilis, again besieging Vetera (chap. 36).\r\n\r\n    [395] i.e. from the rest of Vocula's force, which they had not\r\n          yet deserted.\r\n\r\n    [396] The Aedui, one of the most powerful of the Gallic\r\n          tribes, living between the Saône and the Loire had revolted in\r\n          A.D. 21, and held out for a short time at their chief town\r\n          (Autun).\r\n\r\n    [397] This had only been granted to a few tribes who had\r\n          helped in crushing Vindex (see i. 8 and 51). The Treviri and\r\n          Lingones had been punished. But it is a good rhetorical point.\r\n\r\n    [398] His presumption took away his breath.\r\n\r\n    [399] i.e. artificially reddened according to a Gallic custom.\r\n\r\n    [400] Cp. chap. 69.\r\n\r\n    [401] Under Vespasian she inspired another rebellion and was\r\n          brought as a captive to Rome, where she aroused much polite\r\n          curiosity.\r\n\r\n    [402] Windisch.\r\n\r\n    [403] From the standards.\r\n\r\n    [404] Claudius the Holy; lucus a non lucendo.\r\n\r\n    [405] An auxiliary squadron of Italian horse, originally\r\n          raised, we may suppose, by a provincial governor who was a\r\n          native of Picenum.\r\n\r\n    [406] The Ubii were distrusted as having taken the name\r\n          Agrippinenses and become in some degree Romanized. The town\r\n          was strongly walled, and Germans from outside only admitted on\r\n          payment and under Roman supervision.\r\n\r\n    [407] See chap. 21.\r\n\r\n    [408] Not, of course, to be taken literally. 'The Germans do\r\n          no business public or private except in full armour,' says\r\n          Tacitus in the _Germania_. So to them 'unarmed' meant\r\n          'unclothed'.\r\n\r\n    [409] i.e. the veterans whom Agrippina had sent out to her\r\n          birthplace in A.D. 50.\r\n\r\n    [410] West of the Ubii, between the Roer and the Maas.\r\n\r\n    [411] See chap. 56.\r\n\r\n    [412] Cp. chap. 55.\r\n\r\n    [413] e.g. the inscriptions recording the terms of alliance\r\n          granted to the Lingones by Rome.\r\n\r\n    [414] Round Vesontio (Besançon).\r\n\r\n    [415] The story, which Tacitus presumably told in the lost\r\n          part of his _History_, dealing with the end of Vespasian's\r\n          reign, is mentioned both by Plutarch and Dio. Sabinus and his\r\n          wife lived for nine years in an underground cave, where two\r\n          sons were born to them. They were eventually discovered and\r\n          executed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EBB-TIDE OF REVOLT\r\n\r\nThis success on the part of the Sequani checked the rising flood. The\r\nGallic communities gradually came to their senses and began to\r\nremember their obligations as allies. In this movement the Remi[416]\r\ntook the lead. They circulated a notice throughout Gaul, summoning a\r\nmeeting of delegates to consider whether liberty or peace was the\r\npreferable alternative. At Rome, however, all these disasters were      68\r\nexaggerated, and Mucianus began to feel anxious. He had already\r\nappointed Annius Gallus and Petilius Cerialis to the chief command,\r\nand distinguished officers as they were, he was afraid the conduct of\r\nsuch a war might be too much for them. Moreover, he could not leave\r\nRome without government, but he was afraid of Domitian's unbridled\r\npassions, while, as we have already seen,[417] he suspected Antonius\r\nPrimus and Arrius Varus. Varus, as commanding the Guards, still had\r\nthe chief power and influence in his hands. Mucianus accordingly\r\ndisplaced him, but, as a compensation, made him Director of the\r\nCorn-supply. As he had also to placate Domitian, who was inclined to\r\nsupport Varus, he appointed to the command of the Guards Arrecinus\r\nClemens, who was connected with Vespasian's family[418] and very\r\nfriendly with Domitian. He also impressed it upon Domitian that\r\nClemens' father had filled this command with great distinction under\r\nCaligula: that his name and his character would both find favour with\r\nthe troops, and that, although he was a member of the senate,[419] he\r\nwas quite able to fill both positions. He then chose his staff, some\r\nas being the most eminent men in the country, others as recommended by\r\nprivate influence.\r\n\r\nThus both Domitian and Mucianus made ready to start, but with very\r\ndifferent feelings. Domitian was full of the sanguine haste of youth,\r\nwhile Mucianus kept devising delays to check this enthusiasm. He was\r\nafraid that if Domitian once seized control of an army, his youthful\r\nself-assurance and his bad advisers would lead him into action\r\nprejudicial both to peace and war. Three victorious legions, the\r\nEighth, Eleventh, and Thirteenth;[420] the Twenty-first--one of\r\nVitellius' legions--and the Second, which had been newly enrolled, all\r\nstarted for the front, some by way of the Poenine and Cottian[421]\r\nAlps, others over the Graian Alps.[422] The Fourteenth was also\r\nsummoned from Britain, and the Sixth and First from Spain.\r\n\r\nThe rumour that this force was on its way, combined with the present\r\ntemper of the Gauls, inclined them to adopt a sober policy. Their\r\ndelegates now met in the territory of the Remi, where they found the\r\nrepresentatives of the Treviri awaiting them. One of these, Julius\r\nValentinus, who was the keenest instigator of a hostile policy,\r\ndelivered a set speech, in which he heaped spiteful aspersions on the\r\nRoman people, making all the charges which are usually brought against\r\ngreat empires. He was a clever agitator, whose mad rhetoric made him\r\npopular with the crowd. However, Julius Auspex, a chieftain of the      69\r\nRemi, enlarged upon the power of Rome and the blessings of peace. 'Any\r\ncoward can begin a war,' he said, 'but it is the brave who run the\r\nrisks of its conduct: and here are the legions already upon us.' Thus\r\nhe restrained them, awakening a sense of duty in all the sager\r\nbreasts, and appealing to the fears of the younger men. So, while\r\napplauding Valentinus' courage, they followed the advice of Auspex.\r\nThe fact that in Vindex's rising the Treviri and Lingones sided with\r\nVerginius is known to have told against them in Gaul. Many, too, were\r\nheld back by tribal jealousy. They wanted to know where the\r\nhead-quarters of the war would be, to whom were they to look for\r\nauspices and orders, and, if all went well, which town would be chosen\r\nas the seat of government. Thus dissension preceded victory. They\r\nangrily magnified, some their great connexions, others their wealth\r\nand strength, others their antiquity, until they grew tired of\r\ndiscussing the future and voted for the existing state of things.\r\nLetters were written to the Treviri in the name of All Gaul, bidding\r\nthem cease hostilities, suggesting, however, that pardon might be\r\nobtained, and that many were ready to plead their cause if they showed\r\nrepentance. Valentinus opposed this mandate and made his tribesmen\r\noffer a deaf ear to it. He was always less anxious to organize a\r\ncampaign than to make speeches on every possible occasion.\r\n\r\nThe result was that neither the Treviri nor the Lingones nor the        70\r\nother rebel tribes behaved as if aware of the serious risks they were\r\nundertaking. Even the leaders did not act in concert. Civilis wandered\r\nover the wilds of the Belgic country, trying to catch or expel\r\nClaudius Labeo. Classicus ordinarily took his ease, apparently\r\nenjoying the fruits of empire. Even Tutor seemed in no hurry to\r\ngarrison the Upper Rhine and block the Alpine passes. In the meantime,\r\nthe Twenty-first legion made its way down from Vindonissa, while\r\nSextilius Felix[423] advanced through Raetia with some auxiliary\r\ncohorts. These were joined by the 'Picked Horse',[424] a force that\r\nhad been raised by Vitellius and then deserted to Vespasian. This was\r\ncommanded by Civilis' nephew, Julius Briganticus,[425] for uncle and\r\nnephew hated each other with all the aggravated bitterness of near\r\nrelatives. Tutor swelled his force of Treviri with fresh levies from\r\nthe Vangiones, Triboci, and Caeracates,[426] and a stiffening of Roman\r\nveterans, both horse and foot, who had either been bribed or\r\nintimidated. These first cut up an auxiliary cohort sent forward by\r\nSextilius Felix, but on the advance of the Roman army with its\r\ngenerals they loyally deserted to their old flag, and were followed by\r\nthe Triboci, Vangiones, and Caeracates. Tutor, followed by his\r\nTreviri, avoided Mainz and fell back on Bingium,[427] relying on his\r\nposition there, as he had broken down the bridge over the river Nava.\r\nHowever, Sextilius' cohorts followed him up; some traitor showed them\r\na ford; Tutor was routed. This disaster was a crushing blow to the\r\nTreviri. The rank and file dropped their weapons and took to the\r\nfields, while some of their chieftains, hoping it might be thought\r\nthat they had been the first to lay down arms, took refuge among\r\ntribes who had never repudiated the Roman alliance. The legions which\r\nhad been moved, as we saw above,[428] from Novaesium and Bonn to\r\nTrier, now administered to themselves the oath of allegiance to\r\nVespasian. This happened in Valentinus' absence. When he arrived in\r\nfurious excitement, ready to spread universal ruin and confusion, the\r\nlegions withdrew into the friendly territory of the Mediomatrici.[429]\r\nValentinus and Tutor then led the Treviri forcibly back into the\r\nfield, but first they killed the two Roman officers, Herennius and\r\nNumisius.[430] By diminishing the hope of pardon they tried to cement\r\ntheir bond of crime.\r\n\r\nSuch was the position when Petilius Cerialis reached Mainz. His         71\r\narrival roused high hopes. He was himself thirsting for battle, and\r\nbeing always better at despising his enemy than at taking precautions,\r\nhe fired his men by delivering a spirited harangue, promising that\r\ndirectly there was a chance of getting into touch with the enemy he\r\nwould engage without delay. He dismissed the Gallic recruits to their\r\nhomes with a message that the legions were enough for his task: the\r\nallies could resume their peaceful occupations, feeling assured that\r\nthe war was practically ended, now that Roman troops had taken it in\r\nhand. This action rendered the Gauls all the more tractable. They made\r\nless difficulty about the war-tax, now that they had got their men\r\nback again, while his disdain only sharpened their sense of duty. On\r\nthe other side, when Civilis and Classicus heard of Tutor's defeat,\r\nthe destruction of the Treviri, and the universal success of the Roman\r\narms, they fell into a panic, hastily mobilized their own scattered\r\nforces, and kept sending messages to Valentinus not to risk a decisive\r\nbattle. This only hastened Cerialis' movements. He sent guides to the\r\nlegions stationed in the country of the Mediomatrici to lead them by\r\nthe shortest route on the enemy's rear. Then, assembling all the\r\ntroops to be found in Mainz[431] together with his own force, he\r\nmarched in three days to Rigodulum.[432] Here, on a spot protected by\r\nthe mountains on one side and the Moselle on the other, Valentinus had\r\nalready taken his stand with a large force of Treviri. His camp had\r\nbeen strengthened with trenches and stone barricades, but these\r\nfortifications had no terrors for the Roman general. He ordered the\r\ninfantry to force the position in front, while the cavalry were to\r\nascend the hill. Valentinus' hurriedly assembled forces filled him\r\nwith contempt, for he knew that whatever advantage their position\r\nmight give them, the superior morale of his men would outweigh it. A\r\nshort delay was necessary while the cavalry climbed the hill, exposed\r\nto the enemy's fire. But when the fight began, the Treviri tumbled\r\nheadlong down the hill like a house falling. Some of our cavalry, who\r\nhad ridden round by an easier gradient, captured several Belgic\r\nchieftains, including their general, Valentinus.\r\n\r\nOn the next day Cerialis entered Trier. The troops clamoured            72\r\ngreedily for its destruction. 'It was the native town of Classicus and\r\nof Tutor: these were the men who had wickedly entrapped and\r\nslaughtered the legions. Its guilt was far worse than that of Cremona,\r\nwhich had been wiped off the face of Italy for causing the victors a\r\nsingle night's delay. Was the chief seat of the rebellion to be left\r\nstanding untouched on the German frontier, glorying in the spoil of\r\nRoman armies and the blood of Roman generals?[433] The plunder could\r\ngo to the Imperial Treasury. It would be enough for them to see the\r\nrebel town in smoking ruins; that would be some compensation for the\r\ndestruction of so many camps.' Cerialis was afraid of soiling his\r\nreputation if it was said that he gave his men a taste for cruelty and\r\nriot, so he suppressed their indignation. They obeyed him, too, for\r\nnow that civil war was done with, there was less insubordination on\r\nforeign service. Their thoughts were now distracted by the pitiful\r\nplight of the legions who had been summoned from the country of the\r\nMediomatrici.[434] Miserably conscious of their guilt, they stood with\r\neyes rooted to the ground. When the armies met, they raised no cheer:\r\nthey had no answer for those who offered comfort and encouragement:\r\nthey skulked in their tents, shunning the light of day. It was not\r\nfear of punishment so much as the shame of their disgrace which thus\r\noverwhelmed them. Even the victorious army showed their bewilderment:\r\nhardly venturing to make an audible petition, they craved pardon for\r\nthem with silent tears. At length Cerialis soothed their alarm. He\r\ninsisted that all disasters due to dissension between officers and\r\nmen, or to the enemy's guile, were to be regarded as 'acts of\r\ndestiny'. They were to count this as their first day of service and\r\nsworn allegiance.[435] Neither he nor the emperor would remember past\r\nmisdeeds. He then gave them quarters in his own camp, and sent round\r\norders that no one in the heat of any quarrel should taunt a fellow\r\nsoldier with mutiny or defeat.\r\n\r\nCerialis next summoned the Treviri and Lingones, and addressed          73\r\nthem as follows: 'Unpractised as I am in public speaking, for it is\r\nonly on the field that I have asserted the superiority of Rome, yet\r\nsince words have so much weight with you, and since you distinguish\r\ngood and bad not by the light of facts but by what agitators tell you,\r\nI have decided to make a few remarks, which, as the war is practically\r\nover, are likely to be more profitable to the audience than to\r\nourselves. Roman generals and officers originally set foot in your\r\ncountry and the rest of Gaul from no motives of ambition, but at the\r\ncall of your ancestors, who were worn almost to ruin by dissension.\r\nThe Germans whom one party summoned to their aid had forced the yoke\r\nof slavery on allies and enemies alike. You know how often we fought\r\nagainst the Cimbri and the Teutons, with what infinite pains and with\r\nwhat striking success our armies have undertaken German wars. All that\r\nis notorious. And to-day it is not to protect Italy that we have\r\noccupied the Rhine, but to prevent some second Ariovistus making\r\nhimself master of All Gaul.[436] Do you imagine that Civilis and his\r\nBatavi and the other tribes across the Rhine care any more about you\r\nthan their ancestors cared about your fathers and grandfathers? The\r\nGermans have always had the same motives for trespassing into\r\nGaul--their greed for gain and their desire to change homes with you.\r\nThey wanted to leave their marshes and deserts, and to make themselves\r\nmasters of this magnificently fertile soil and of you who live on it.\r\nOf course they use specious pretexts and talk about liberty. No one\r\nhas ever wanted to enslave others and play the tyrant without making\r\nuse of the very same phrases.\r\n\r\n'Tyranny and warfare were always rife throughout the length and         74\r\nbreadth of Gaul, until you accepted Roman government. Often as we have\r\nbeen provoked, we have never imposed upon you any burden by right of\r\nconquest, except what was necessary to maintain peace. Tribes cannot\r\nbe kept quiet without troops. You cannot have troops without pay; and\r\nyou cannot raise pay without taxation. In every other respect you are\r\ntreated as our equals. You frequently command our legions yourselves:\r\nyou govern this and other provinces yourselves. We have no exclusive\r\nprivileges. Though you live so far away, you enjoy the blessings of a\r\ngood emperor no less than we do, whereas the tyrant only oppresses\r\nhis nearest neighbours. You must put up with luxury and greed in your\r\nmasters, just as you put up with bad crops or excessive rain, or any\r\nother natural disaster. Vice will last as long as mankind. But these\r\nevils are not continual. There are intervals of good government, which\r\nmake up for them. You cannot surely hope that the tyranny of Tutor and\r\nClassicus would mean milder government, or that they will need less\r\ntaxation for the armies they will have to raise to keep the Germans\r\nand Britons at bay. For if the Romans were driven out--which Heaven\r\nforbid--what could ensue save a universal state of intertribal\r\nwarfare? During eight hundred years, by good fortune and good\r\norganization, the structure of empire has been consolidated. It cannot\r\nbe pulled down without destroying those who do it. And it is you who\r\nwould run the greatest risk of all, since you have gold and rich\r\nresources, which are the prime causes of war. You must learn, then, to\r\nlove and foster peace and the city of Rome in which you, the\r\nvanquished, have the same rights as your conquerors. You have tried\r\nboth conditions. Take warning, then, that submission and safety are\r\nbetter than rebellion and ruin.' By such words as these he quieted and\r\nreassured his audience, who had been afraid of more rigorous measures.\r\n\r\nWhile the victors were occupying Trier, Civilis and Classicus sent      75\r\na letter to Cerialis, the gist of which was that Vespasian was dead,\r\nthough the news was being suppressed: Rome and Italy were exhausted by\r\ncivil war: Mucianus and Domitian were mere names with no power behind\r\nthem: if Cerialis desired to be emperor of All Gaul, they would be\r\nsatisfied with their own territory: but if he should prefer battle,\r\nthat, too, they would not deny him. Cerialis made no answer to Civilis\r\nand Classicus, but sent the letter and its bearer to Domitian.\r\n\r\nThe enemy now approached Trier from every quarter in detached bands,\r\nand Cerialis was much criticized for allowing them to unite, when he\r\nmight have cut them off one by one. The Roman army now threw a trench\r\nand rampart round their camp, for they had rashly settled in it\r\nwithout seeing to the fortifications. In the German camp different      76\r\nopinions were being keenly debated. Civilis contended that they should\r\nwait for the tribes from across the Rhine, whose arrival would spread\r\na panic sufficient to crush the enfeebled forces of the Romans. The\r\nGauls, he urged, were simply a prey for the winning side and, as it\r\nwas, the Belgae, who were their sole strength, had declared for him or\r\nwere at least sympathetic. Tutor maintained that delay only\r\nstrengthened the Roman force, since their armies were converging from\r\nevery quarter. 'They have brought one legion across from Britain,\r\nothers have been summoned from Spain, or are on their way from\r\nItaly.[437] Nor are they raw recruits, but experienced veterans, while\r\nthe Germans, on whose aid we rely, are subject to no discipline or\r\ncontrol, but do whatever they like. You can only bribe them with\r\npresents of money, and the Romans have the advantage of us there:\r\nbesides, however keen to fight, a man always prefers peace to danger,\r\nso long as the pay is the same. But if we engage them at once,\r\nCerialis has nothing but the remnants of the German army,[438] who\r\nhave sworn allegiance to the Gallic Empire. The very fact that they\r\nhave just won an unexpected victory over Valentinus' undisciplined\r\nbands[439] serves to confirm them and their general in imprudence.\r\nThey will venture out again and will fall, not into the hands of an\r\ninexperienced boy, who knows more about making speeches than war, but\r\ninto the hands of Civilis and Classicus, at the sight of whom they\r\nwill recall their fears and their flights and their famine, and\r\nremember how often they have had to beg their lives from their\r\ncaptors. Nor, again, is it any liking for the Romans that keeps back\r\nthe Treviri and Lingones: they will fly to arms again, when once their\r\nfears are dispelled.' Classicus finally settled the difference of\r\nopinion by declaring for Tutor's policy, and they promptly proceeded\r\nto carry it out.\r\n\r\nThe Ubii and Lingones were placed in the centre, the Batavian           77\r\ncohorts on the right, and on the left the Bructeri and Tencteri.\r\nAdvancing, some by the hills and some by the path between the road and\r\nthe river,[440] they took us completely by surprise. So sudden was\r\ntheir onslaught that Cerialis, who had not spent the night in camp,\r\nwas still in bed when he heard almost simultaneously that the fighting\r\nhad begun and that the day was lost. He cursed the messengers for\r\ntheir cowardice until he saw the whole extent of the disaster with his\r\nown eyes. The camp had been forced, the cavalry routed, and the bridge\r\nover the Moselle, leading to the outskirts of the town, which lay\r\nbetween him and his army,[440] was held by the enemy. But confusion\r\nhad no terrors for Cerialis. Seizing hold on fugitives, flinging\r\nhimself without any armour into the thick of the fire, he succeeded by\r\nhis inspired imprudence and the assistance of the braver men in\r\nretaking the bridge. Leaving a picked band to hold it, he hurried back\r\nto the camp, where he found that the companies of the legions which\r\nhad surrendered at Bonn and Novaesium[441] were all broken up, few men\r\nwere left at their posts, and the eagles were all but surrounded by\r\nthe enemy. He turned on them in blazing anger, 'It is not Flaccus or\r\nVocula that you are deserting. There is no \"treason\" about me. I have\r\ndone nothing to be ashamed of, except that I was rash enough to\r\nbelieve that you had forgotten your Gallic ties and awakened to the\r\nmemory of your Roman allegiance. Am I to be numbered with Numisius\r\nand Herennius?[442] Then you can say that all your generals have\r\nfallen either by your hands or the enemy's. Go and tell the news to\r\nVespasian, or rather, to Civilis and Classicus--they are nearer at\r\nhand--that you have deserted your general on the field of battle.\r\nThere will yet come legions who will not leave me unavenged or you\r\nunpunished.'\r\n\r\nAll he said was true, and the other officers heaped the same            78\r\nreproaches on their heads. The men were drawn up in cohorts and\r\ncompanies, since it was impossible to deploy with the enemy swarming\r\nround them, and, the fight being inside the rampart, the tents and\r\nbaggage were a serious encumbrance. Tutor and Classicus and Civilis,\r\neach at his post, were busy rallying their forces, appealing to the\r\nGauls to fight for freedom, the Batavians for glory, and the Germans\r\nfor plunder. Everything, indeed, went well for the enemy until the\r\nTwenty-first legion, who had rallied in a clearer space than any of\r\nthe others, first sustained their charge and then repulsed them. Then,\r\nby divine providence, on the very point of victory the enemy suddenly\r\nlost their nerve and turned tail. They themselves attributed their\r\npanic to the appearance of the Roman auxiliaries, who, after being\r\nscattered by the first charge, formed again on the hill-tops and were\r\ntaken for fresh reinforcements. However, what really cost the Gauls\r\ntheir victory was that they let their enemy alone and indulged in\r\nignoble squabbles over the spoil. Thus after Cerialis' carelessness\r\nhad almost caused disaster, his pluck now saved the day, and he\r\nfollowed up his success by capturing the enemy's camp and destroying\r\nit before nightfall.\r\n\r\nCerialis' troops were allowed short respite. Cologne was                79\r\nclamouring for help and offering to surrender Civilis' wife and sister\r\nand Classicus' daughter, who had been left behind there as pledges of\r\nthe alliance. In the meantime the inhabitants had massacred all the\r\nstray Germans to be found in the town. They were now alarmed at this,\r\nand had good reason to implore aid before the enemy should recover\r\ntheir strength and bethink themselves of victory, or at any rate of\r\nrevenge. Indeed, Civilis already had designs on Cologne, and he was\r\nstill formidable, for the most warlike of his cohorts, composed of\r\nChauci and Frisii,[443] was still in full force at Tolbiacum,[444]\r\nwithin the territory of Cologne. However, he changed his plans on\r\nreceiving the bitter news that this force had been entrapped and\r\ndestroyed by the inhabitants of Cologne. They had entertained them at\r\na lavish banquet, drugged them with wine, shut the doors upon them and\r\nburned the place to the ground. At the same moment Cerialis came by\r\nforced marches to the relief of Cologne. A further anxiety haunted\r\nCivilis. He was afraid that the Fourteenth legion, in conjunction with\r\nthe fleet from Britain,[445] might harry the Batavian coast. However,\r\nFabius Priscus, who was in command, led his troops inland into the\r\ncountry of the Nervii and Tungri, who surrendered to him. The\r\nCanninefates[446] made an unprovoked attack upon the fleet and sank or\r\ncaptured the greater number of the ships. They also defeated a band of\r\nNervian volunteers who had been recruited in the Roman interest.\r\nClassicus secured a further success against an advance-guard of\r\ncavalry which Cerialis had sent forward to Novaesium. These repeated\r\nchecks, though unimportant in themselves, served to dim the lustre of\r\nthe recent Roman victory.[447]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [416] Round Reims.\r\n\r\n    [417] Chap. 39.\r\n\r\n    [418] His sister was Titus's first wife.\r\n\r\n    [419] Augustus had made it a rule that the _praefectus\r\n          praetorio_ should come from the equestrian order.\r\n\r\n    [420] The text is here uncertain, and some historians maintain\r\n          that the third of these legions was not XIII Gemina but VII\r\n          Claudia (v.

He also refused to allow\r\nAntonius Primus to go out on Domitian's staff, being alarmed at his\r\npopularity among the troops and at the man's own vanity, which would\r\nbrook no equal, much less a superior. Antonius accordingly went to\r\njoin Vespasian, whose reception, though not hostile, proved a\r\ndisappointment. The emperor was drawn two ways. On the one side were\r\nAntonius' services: it was undeniable that his generalship had ended\r\nthe war. In the other scale were Mucianus' letters. Besides which,\r\nevery one else seemed ready to rake up the scandals of his past life\r\nand inveigh against his vanity and bad temper. Antonius himself did\r\nhis best to provoke hostility by expatiating to excess on his\r\nservices, decrying the other generals as incompetent cowards, and\r\nstigmatizing Caecina as a prisoner who had surrendered. Thus without\r\nany open breach of friendship he gradually declined lower and lower in\r\nthe emperor's favour.\r\n\r\nDuring the months which Vespasian spent at Alexandria waiting for       81\r\nthe regular season of the summer winds[449] to ensure a safe voyage,\r\nthere occurred many miraculous events manifesting the goodwill of\r\nHeaven and the special favour of Providence towards him. At Alexandria\r\na poor workman who was well known to have a disease of the eye, acting\r\non the advice of Serapis, whom this superstitious people worship as\r\ntheir chief god, fell at Vespasian's feet demanding with sobs a cure\r\nfor his blindness, and imploring that the emperor would deign to\r\nmoisten his eyes and eyeballs with the spittle from his mouth. Another\r\nman with a maimed hand, also inspired by Serapis, besought Vespasian\r\nto imprint his footmark on it. At first Vespasian laughed at them and\r\nrefused. But they insisted. Half fearing to be thought a fool, half\r\nstirred to hopes by their petition and by the flattery of his\r\ncourtiers, he eventually told the doctors to form an opinion whether\r\nsuch cases of blindness and deformity could be remedied by human aid.\r\nThe doctors talked round the question, saying that in the one case the\r\npower of sight was not extinct and would return, if certain\r\nimpediments were removed; in the other case the limbs were distorted\r\nand could be set right again by the application of an effective\r\nremedy: this might be the will of Heaven and the emperor had perhaps\r\nbeen chosen as the divine instrument. They added that he would gain\r\nall the credit, if the cure were successful, while, if it failed, the\r\nridicule would fall on the unfortunate patients. This convinced\r\nVespasian that there were no limits to his destiny: nothing now seemed\r\nincredible. To the great excitement of the bystanders, he stepped\r\nforward with a smile on his face and did as the men desired him.\r\nImmediately the hand recovered its functions and daylight shone once\r\nmore in the blind man's eyes. Those who were present still attest both\r\nmiracles to-day,[450] when there is nothing to gain by lying.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence deepened Vespasian's desire to visit the                82\r\nholy-place and consult Serapis about the fortunes of the empire. He\r\ngave orders that no one else was to be allowed in the temple, and then\r\nwent in. While absorbed in his devotions, he suddenly saw behind him\r\nan Egyptian noble, named Basilides, whom he knew to be lying ill\r\nseveral days' journey from Alexandria. He inquired of the priests\r\nwhether Basilides had entered the temple that day. He inquired of\r\nevery one he met whether he had been seen in the city. Eventually he\r\nsent some horsemen, who discovered that at the time Basilides was\r\neighty miles away. Vespasian therefore took what he had seen for a\r\ndivine apparition, and guessed the meaning of the oracle from the name\r\n'Basilides'.[451]\r\n\r\nThe origins of the god Serapis are not given in any Roman               83\r\nauthorities. The high-priests of Egypt give the following account:\r\nKing Ptolemy, who was the first of the Macedonians to put the power of\r\nEgypt on a firm footing,[452] was engaged in building walls and\r\ntemples, and instituting religious cults for his newly founded city of\r\nAlexandria, when there appeared to him in his sleep a young man of\r\nstriking beauty and supernatural stature, who warned him to send his\r\nmost faithful friends to Pontus to fetch his image. After adding that\r\nthis would bring luck to the kingdom, and that its resting-place would\r\ngrow great and famous, he appeared to be taken up into heaven in a\r\nsheet of flame. Impressed by this miraculous prophecy, Ptolemy\r\nrevealed his vision to the priests of Egypt, who are used to\r\ninterpreting such things. As they had but little knowledge of Pontus\r\nor of foreign cults, he consulted an Athenian named Timotheus, a\r\nmember of the Eumolpid clan,[453] whom he had brought over from\r\nEleusis to be overseer of religious ceremonies, and asked him what\r\nworship and what god could possibly be meant. Timotheus found some\r\npeople who had travelled in Pontus and learnt from them, that near a\r\ntown called Sinope there was a temple, which had long been famous in\r\nthe neighbourhood as the seat of Jupiter-Pluto,[454] and near it there\r\nalso stood a female figure, which was commonly called Proserpine.\r\nPtolemy was like most despots, easily terrified at first, but liable,\r\nwhen his panic was over, to think more of his pleasures than of his\r\nreligious duties. The incident was gradually forgotten, and other\r\nthoughts occupied his mind until the vision was repeated in a more\r\nterrible and impressive form than before, and he was threatened with\r\ndeath and the destruction of his kingdom if he failed to fulfil his\r\ninstructions. He at once gave orders that representatives should be\r\nsent with presents to King Scydrothemis, who was then reigning at\r\nSinope, and on their departure he instructed them to consult the\r\noracle of Apollo at Delphi. They made a successful voyage and received\r\na clear answer from the oracle: they were to go and bring back the\r\nimage of Apollo's father but leave his sister's behind.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at Sinope they laid their presents, their              84\r\npetition, and their king's instructions before Scydrothemis. He was in\r\nsome perplexity. He was afraid of the god and yet alarmed by the\r\nthreats of his subjects, who opposed the project: then, again, he\r\noften felt tempted by the envoys' presents and promises. Three years\r\npassed. Ptolemy's zeal never abated for a moment. He persisted in his\r\npetition, and kept sending more and more distinguished envoys, more\r\nships, more gold. Then a threatening vision appeared to Scydrothemis,\r\nbidding him no longer thwart the god's design. When he still\r\nhesitated, he was beset by every kind of disease and disaster: the\r\ngods were plainly angry and their hand was heavier upon him every day.\r\nHe summoned an assembly and laid before it the divine commands, his\r\nown and Ptolemy's visions, and the troubles with which they were\r\nvisited. The king found the people unfavourable. They were jealous of\r\nEgypt and fearful of their own future. So they surged angrily round\r\nthe temple. The story now grows stranger still. The god himself, it\r\nsays, embarked unaided on one of the ships that lay beached on the\r\nshore, and by a miracle accomplished the long sea-journey and landed\r\nat Alexandria within three days. A temple worthy of so important a\r\ncity was then built in the quarter called Rhacotis, on the site of an\r\nancient temple of Serapis and Isis.[455] This is the most widely\r\naccepted account of the god's origin and arrival. Some people, I am\r\nwell aware, maintain that the god was brought from the Syrian town of\r\nSeleucia during the reign of Ptolemy, the third of that name.[456]\r\nOthers, again, say it was this same Ptolemy, but make the place of\r\norigin the famous town of Memphis,[457] once the bulwark of ancient\r\nEgypt. Many take the god for Aesculapius, because he cures disease:\r\nothers for Osiris, the oldest of the local gods; some, again, for\r\nJupiter, as being the sovereign lord of the world. But the majority of\r\npeople, either judging by what are clearly attributes of the god or by\r\nan ingenious process of conjecture, identify him with Pluto.\r\n\r\nDomitian and Mucianus were now on their way to the Alps.[458]           85\r\nBefore reaching the mountains they received the good news of the\r\nvictory over the Treviri, the truth of which was fully attested by the\r\npresence of their leader Valentinus. His courage was in no way crushed\r\nand his face still bore witness to the proud spirit he had shown. He\r\nwas allowed a hearing, merely to see what he was made of, and\r\ncondemned to death. At his execution some one cast it in his teeth\r\nthat his country was conquered, to which he replied, 'Then I am\r\nreconciled to death.'\r\n\r\nMucianus now gave utterance to an idea which he had long cherished,\r\nthough he pretended it was a sudden inspiration. This was that, since\r\nby Heaven's grace the forces of the enemy had been broken, it would\r\nill befit Domitian, now that the war was practically over, to stand\r\nin the way of the other generals to whom the credit belonged. Were the\r\nfortunes of the empire or the safety of Gaul at stake, it would be\r\nright that a Caesar should take the field; the Canninefates and Batavi\r\nmight be left to minor generals. So Domitian was to stay at Lugdunum\r\nand there show them the power and majesty of the throne at close\r\nquarters. By abstaining from trifling risks he would be ready to cope\r\nwith any greater crisis.\r\n\r\nThe ruse was detected, but it could not be unmasked. That was part      86\r\nof the courtier's policy.[459] Thus they proceeded to Lugdunum. From\r\nthere Domitian is supposed to have sent messengers to Cerialis to test\r\nhis loyalty, and to ask whether the general would transfer his army\r\nand his allegiance to him, should he present himself in person.\r\nWhether Domitian's idea was to plan war against his father or to\r\nacquire support against his brother, cannot be decided, for Cerialis\r\nparried his proposal with a salutary snub and treated it as a boy's\r\nday-dream. Realizing that older men despised his youth, Domitian gave\r\nup even those functions of government which he had hitherto performed.\r\nAping bashfulness and simple tastes, he hid his feelings under a cloak\r\nof impenetrable reserve, professing literary tastes and a passion for\r\npoetry. Thus he concealed his real self and withdrew from all rivalry\r\nwith his brother, whose gentler and altogether different nature he\r\nperversely misconstrued.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [448] Cp. ii. 59.\r\n\r\n    [449] During June and July before the Etesian winds (cp. ii. 98)\r\n          began to blow from the north-west.\r\n\r\n    [450] Circa A.D. 108.\r\n\r\n    [451] Meaning 'king's son', and therefore portending sovereignty.\r\n\r\n    [452] i.e. Ptolemy Soter, who founded the dynasty of the\r\n          Lagidae, and reigned 306-283 B.C.\r\n\r\n    [453] They inherited the priesthood of Demeter at Eleusis and\r\n          supplied the hierophants who conducted the mysteries.\r\n\r\n    [454] i.e. the sovereign god of the underworld.\r\n\r\n    [455] It is evident from these words that the worship of\r\n          Serapis was ancient in Egypt. It seems to be suggested that\r\n          the arrival of this statue from Pontus did not originate but\r\n          invigorated the cult of Serapis. Pluto, Dis, Serapis, are all\r\n          names for a god of the underworld. Jupiter seems added vaguely\r\n          to give more power to the title.

Wishing to seem independent of\r\nhis good fortune, he always showed dignity and energy in the field.\r\nHis affability called forth devotion. He constantly helped in the\r\ntrenches and could mingle with his soldiers on the march without\r\ncompromising his dignity as general. Three legions awaited him in\r\nJudaea, the Fifth, Tenth, and Fifteenth, all veterans from his\r\nfather's army. These were reinforced by the Twelfth from Syria and by\r\ndetachments of the Twenty-second and the Third,[462] brought over from\r\nAlexandria. This force was accompanied by twenty auxiliary cohorts and\r\neight regiments of auxiliary cavalry besides the Kings Agrippa and\r\nSohaemus, King Antiochus' irregulars,[463] a strong force of Arabs,\r\nwho had a neighbourly hatred for the Jews, and a crowd of persons who\r\nhad come from Rome and the rest of Italy, each tempted by the hope of\r\nsecuring the first place in the prince's still unoccupied affections.\r\nWith this force Titus entered the enemy's country at the head of his\r\ncolumn, sending out scouts in all directions, and holding himself\r\nready to fight. He pitched his camp not far from Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nSince I am coming now to describe the last days of this famous           2\r\ncity, it may not seem out of place to recount here its early history.\r\nIt is said that the Jews are refugees from Crete,[464] who settled on\r\nthe confines of Libya at the time when Saturn was forcibly deposed by\r\nJupiter. The evidence for this is sought in the name. Ida is a famous\r\nmountain in Crete inhabited by the Idaei,[465] whose name became\r\nlengthened into the foreign form Judaei. Others say that in the reign\r\nof Isis the superfluous population of Egypt, under the leadership of\r\nHierosolymus and Juda, discharged itself upon the neighbouring\r\ndistricts, while there are many who think the Jews an Ethiopian stock,\r\ndriven to migrate by their fear and dislike of King Cepheus.[466]\r\nAnother tradition makes them Assyrian refugees,[467] who, lacking\r\nlands of their own, occupied a district of Egypt, and later took to\r\nbuilding cities of their own and tilling Hebrew territory and the\r\nfrontier-land of Syria. Yet another version assigns to the Jews an\r\nillustrious origin as the descendants of the Solymi--a tribe famous in\r\nHomer[468]--who founded the city and called it Hiero_solyma_ after\r\ntheir own name.[469]\r\n\r\nMost authorities agree that a foul and disfiguring disease once          3\r\nbroke out in Egypt, and that King Bocchoris,[470] on approaching the\r\noracle of Ammon and inquiring for a remedy, was told to purge his\r\nkingdom of the plague and to transport all who suffered from it into\r\nsome other country, for they had earned the disfavour of Heaven. A\r\nmotley crowd was thus collected and abandoned in the desert. While all\r\nthe other outcasts lay idly lamenting, one of them, named Moses,\r\nadvised them not to look for help to gods or men, since both had\r\ndeserted them, but to trust rather in themselves and accept as divine\r\nthe guidance of the first being by whose aid they should get out of\r\ntheir present plight. They agreed, and set out blindly to march\r\nwherever chance might lead them. Their worst distress came from lack\r\nof water. When they were already at death's door and lying prostrate\r\nall over the plain, it so happened that a drove of wild asses moved\r\naway from their pasture to a rock densely covered with trees. Guessing\r\nthe truth from the grassy nature of the ground, Moses followed and\r\ndisclosed an ample flow of water.[471] This saved them. Continuing\r\ntheir march for six successive days, on the seventh they routed the\r\nnatives and gained possession of the country. There they consecrated\r\ntheir city and their temple.\r\n\r\nTo ensure his future hold over the people, Moses introduced a new        4\r\ncult, which was the opposite of all other religions. All that we hold\r\nsacred they held profane, and allowed practices which we abominate.\r\nThey dedicated in a shrine an image of the animal[472] whose guidance\r\nhad put an end to their wandering and thirst. They killed a ram,\r\napparently as an insult to Ammon, and also sacrificed a bull, because\r\nthe Egyptians worship the bull Apis.[473] Pigs are subject to leprosy;\r\nso they abstain from pork in memory of their misfortune and the foul\r\nplague with which they were once infected. Their frequent fasts[474]\r\nbear witness to the long famine they once endured, and, in token of\r\nthe corn they carried off, Jewish bread is to this day made without\r\nleaven. They are said to have devoted the seventh day to rest, because\r\nthat day brought an end to their troubles.[475] Later, finding\r\nidleness alluring, they gave up the seventh year as well to\r\nsloth.[476] Others maintain that they do this in honour of\r\nSaturn;[477] either because their religious principles are derived\r\nfrom the Idaei, who are supposed to have been driven out with Saturn\r\nand become the ancestors of the Jewish people; or else because, of the\r\nseven constellations which govern the lives of men, the star of Saturn\r\nmoves in the topmost orbit and exercises peculiar influence, and also\r\nbecause most of the heavenly bodies move round[478] their courses in\r\nmultiples of seven.\r\n\r\nWhatever their origin, these rites are sanctioned by their               5\r\nantiquity. Their other customs are impious and abominable, and owe\r\ntheir prevalence to their depravity. For all the most worthless\r\nrascals, renouncing their national cults, were always sending money to\r\nswell the sum of offerings and tribute.[479] This is one cause of\r\nJewish prosperity. Another is that they are obstinately loyal to each\r\nother, and always ready to show compassion, whereas they feel nothing\r\nbut hatred and enmity for the rest of the world.[480] They eat and\r\nsleep separately. Though immoderate in sexual indulgence, they refrain\r\nfrom all intercourse with foreign women: among themselves anything is\r\nallowed.[481] They have introduced circumcision to distinguish\r\nthemselves from other people. Those who are converted to their customs\r\nadopt the same practice, and the first lessons they learn are to\r\ndespise the gods,[482] to renounce their country, and to think nothing\r\nof their parents, children, and brethren. However, they take steps to\r\nincrease their numbers. They count it a crime to kill any of their\r\nlater-born children,[483] and they believe that the souls of those who\r\ndie in battle or under persecution are immortal.[484] Thus they think\r\nmuch of having children and nothing of facing death. They prefer to\r\nbury and not burn their dead.[485] In this, as in their burial rites,\r\nand in their belief in an underworld, they conform to Egyptian custom.\r\nTheir ideas of heaven are quite different. The Egyptians worship most\r\nof their gods as animals, or in shapes half animal and half human. The\r\nJews acknowledge one god only, of whom they have a purely spiritual\r\nconception. They think it impious to make images of gods in human\r\nshape out of perishable materials. Their god is almighty and\r\ninimitable, without beginning and without end. They therefore set up\r\nno statues in their temples, nor even in their cities, refusing this\r\nhomage both to their own kings and to the Roman emperors. However, the\r\nfact that their priests intoned to the flute and cymbals and wore\r\nwreaths of ivy, and that a golden vine was found in their temple[486]\r\nhas led some people to think that they worship Bacchus,[487] who has\r\nso enthralled the East. But their cult would be most inappropriate.\r\nBacchus instituted gay and cheerful rites, but the Jewish ritual is\r\npreposterous and morbid.\r\n\r\nThe country of the Jews is bounded by Arabia on the east, by Egypt       6\r\non the south, and on the west by Phoenicia and the sea. On the Syrian\r\nfrontier they have a distant view towards the north.[488] Physically\r\nthey are healthy and hardy. Rain is rare; the soil infertile; its\r\nproducts are of the same kind as ours with the addition of balsam and\r\npalms. The palm is a tall and beautiful tree, the balsam a mere shrub.\r\nWhen its branches are swollen with sap they open them with a sharp\r\npiece of stone or crockery, for the sap-vessels shrink up at the touch\r\nof iron. The sap is used in medicine. Lebanon, their chief mountain,\r\nstands always deep in its eternal snow, a strange phenomenon in such a\r\nburning climate. Here, too, the river Jordan has its source[489] and\r\ncomes pouring down, to find a home in the sea. It flows undiminished\r\nthrough first one lake, then another, and loses itself in a\r\nthird.[490] This last is a lake of immense size, like a sea, though\r\nits water has a foul taste and a most unhealthy smell, which poisons\r\nthe surrounding inhabitants. No wind can stir waves in it: no fish or\r\nsea-birds can live there. The sluggish water supports whatever is\r\nthrown on to it, as if its surface were solid, while those who cannot\r\nswim float on it as easily as those who can. Every year at the same\r\ntime the lake yields asphalt. As with other arts, it is experience\r\nwhich shows how to collect it. It is a black liquid which, when\r\ncongealed with a sprinkling of vinegar, floats on the surface of the\r\nwater. The men who collect it take it in this state into their hands\r\nand haul it on deck. Then without further aid it trickles in and loads\r\nthe boat until you cut off the stream. But this you cannot do with\r\niron or brass: the current is turned by applying blood or a garment\r\nstained with a woman's menstrual discharge. That is what the old\r\nauthorities say, but those who know the district aver that floating\r\nblocks of asphalt are driven landwards by the wind and dragged to\r\nshore by hand. The steam out of the earth and the heat of the sun\r\ndries them, and they are then split up with axes and wedges, like logs\r\nor blocks of stone.\r\n\r\nNot far from this lake are the Plains, which they say were once          7\r\nfertile and covered with large and populous cities which were\r\ndestroyed by lightning.[491] Traces of the cities are said to remain,\r\nand the ground, which looks scorched, has lost all power of\r\nproduction. The plants, whether wild or artificially cultivated, are\r\nblighted and sterile and wither into dust and ashes, either when in\r\nleaf or flower, or when they have attained their full growth. Without\r\ndenying that at some date famous cities were there burnt up by\r\nlightning, I am yet inclined to think that it is the exhalation from\r\nthe lake which infects the soil and poisons the surrounding\r\natmosphere. Soil and climate being equally deleterious, the crops and\r\nfruits all rot away.\r\n\r\nThe river Belus also falls into this Jewish sea. Round its mouth is\r\nfound a peculiar kind of sand which is mixed with native soda and\r\nsmelted into glass. Small though the beach is, its product is\r\ninexhaustible.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the population live in scattered villages, but       8\r\nthey also have towns. Jerusalem is the Jewish capital, and contained\r\nthe temple, which was enormously wealthy. A first line of\r\nfortifications guarded the city, another the palace, and an innermost\r\nline enclosed the temple.[492] None but a Jew was allowed as far as\r\nthe doors: none but the priests might cross the threshold.[493] When\r\nthe East was in the hands of the Assyrians, Medes and Persians, they\r\nregarded the Jews as the meanest of their slaves. During the\r\nMacedonian ascendancy[494] King Antiochus[495] endeavoured to abolish\r\ntheir superstitions and to introduce Greek manners and customs. But\r\nArsaces at that moment rebelled,[496] and the Parthian war prevented\r\nhim from effecting any improvement in the character of this grim\r\npeople. Then, when Macedon waned, as the Parthian power was not yet\r\nripe and Rome was still far away, they took kings of their own.[497]\r\nThe mob were fickle and drove them out. However, they recovered their\r\nthrone by force; banished their countrymen, sacked cities, slew their\r\nbrothers, wives, and parents, and committed all the usual kingly\r\ncrimes. But this only fostered the hold of the Jewish religion, since\r\nthe kings had strengthened their authority by assuming the priesthood.\r\n\r\nCnaeus Pompeius was the first Roman to subdue the Jews and set foot      9\r\nin their temple by right of conquest.[498] It was then first realized\r\nthat the temple contained no image of any god: their sanctuary was\r\nempty, their mysteries meaningless. The walls of Jerusalem were\r\ndestroyed, but the temple was left standing. Later, during the Roman\r\ncivil wars, when the eastern provinces had come under the control of\r\nMark Antony, the Parthian Prince Pacorus seized Judaea,[499] and was\r\nkilled by Publius Ventidius. The Parthians were driven back over the\r\nEuphrates, and Caius Sosius[500] subdued the Jews. Antony gave the\r\nkingdom to Herod,[501] and Augustus, after his victory, enlarged it.\r\nAfter Herod's death, somebody called Simon,[502] without awaiting the\r\nemperor's decision, forcibly assumed the title of king. He was\r\nexecuted by Quintilius Varus, who was Governor of Syria; the Jews were\r\nrepressed and the kingdom divided between three of Herod's sons.[503]\r\nUnder Tiberius all was quiet. Caligula ordered them to put up his\r\nstatue in the temple. They preferred war to that. But Caligula's death\r\nput an end to the rising.[504] In Claudius' reign the kings had all\r\neither died or lost most of their territory. The emperor therefore\r\nmade Judaea a province to be governed by Roman knights or freedmen.\r\nOne of these, Antonius Felix,[505] indulged in every kind of cruelty\r\nand immorality, wielding a king's authority with all the instincts of\r\na slave. He had married Drusilla, a granddaughter of Antony and\r\nCleopatra, so that he was Antony's grandson-in-law, while Claudius was\r\nAntony's grandson.[506]\r\n\r\nThe Jews endured such oppression patiently until the time of            10\r\nGessius Florus,[507] under whom war broke out. Cestius Gallus, the\r\nGovernor of Syria, tried to crush it, but met with more reverses than\r\nvictories. He died, either in the natural course or perhaps of\r\ndisgust, and Nero sent out Vespasian, who, in a couple of\r\ncampaigns,[508] thanks to his reputation, good fortune, and able\r\nsubordinates, had the whole of the country districts and all the\r\ntowns except Jerusalem under the heel of his victorious army. The next\r\nyear[509] was taken up with civil war, and passed quietly enough as\r\nfar as the Jews were concerned. But peace once restored in Italy,\r\nforeign troubles began again with feelings embittered on our side by\r\nthe thought that the Jews were the only people who had not given in.\r\nAt the same time it seemed best to leave Titus at the head of the army\r\nto meet the eventualities of the new reign, whether good or bad.\r\n\r\nThus, as we have already seen,[510] Titus pitched his camp before       11\r\nthe walls of Jerusalem and proceeded to display his legions in battle\r\norder. The Jews formed up at the foot of their own walls, ready, if\r\nsuccessful, to venture further, but assured of their retreat in case\r\nof reverse. A body of cavalry and some light-armed foot were sent\r\nforward, and fought an indecisive engagement, from which the enemy\r\neventually retired. During the next few days a series of skirmishes\r\ntook place in front of the gates, and at last continual losses drove\r\nthe Jews behind their walls. The Romans then determined to take it by\r\nstorm. It seemed undignified to sit and wait for the enemy to starve,\r\nand the men all clamoured for the risks, some being really brave,\r\nwhile many others were wild and greedy for plunder. Titus himself had\r\nthe vision of Rome with all her wealth and pleasures before his eyes,\r\nand felt that their enjoyment was postponed unless Jerusalem fell at\r\nonce. The city, however, stands high and is fortified with works\r\nstrong enough to protect a city standing on the plain. Two enormous\r\nhills[511] were surrounded by walls ingeniously built so as to project\r\nor slope inwards and thus leave the flanks of an attacking party\r\nexposed to fire. The rocks were jagged at the top. The towers, where\r\nthe rising ground helped, were sixty feet high, and in the hollows as\r\nmuch as a hundred and twenty. They are a wonderful sight and seem from\r\na distance to be all of equal height. Within this runs another line of\r\nfortification surrounding the palace, and on a conspicuous height\r\nstands the Antonia, a castle named by Herod in honour of Mark Antony.\r\n\r\nThe temple was built like a citadel with walls of its own, on           12\r\nwhich more care and labour had been spent than on any of the others.\r\nEven the cloisters surrounding the temple formed a splendid rampart.\r\nThere was a never-failing spring of water,[512] catacombs hollowed out\r\nof the hills, and pools or cisterns for holding the rain-water. Its\r\noriginal builders had foreseen that the peculiarities of Jewish life\r\nwould lead to frequent wars, consequently everything was ready for the\r\nlongest of sieges. Besides this, when Pompey took the city, bitter\r\nexperience taught them several lessons, and in the days of Claudius\r\nthey had taken advantage of his avarice to buy rights of\r\nfortification, and built walls in peace-time as though war were\r\nimminent. Their numbers were now swelled by floods of human refuse and\r\nunfortunate refugees from other towns.[513] All the most desperate\r\ncharacters in the country had taken refuge there, which did not\r\nconduce to unity. They had three armies, each with its own general.\r\nThe outermost and largest line of wall was held by Simon; the central\r\ncity by John, and the temple by Eleazar.[514] John and Simon were\r\nstronger than Eleazar in numbers and equipment, but he had the\r\nadvantage of a strong position. Their relations mainly consisted of\r\nfighting, treachery, and arson: a large quantity of corn was burnt.\r\nEventually, under pretext of offering a sacrifice, John sent a party\r\nof men to massacre Eleazar and his troops, and by this means gained\r\npossession of the temple.[515] Thus Jerusalem was divided into two\r\nhostile parties, but on the approach of the Romans the necessities of\r\nforeign warfare reconciled their differences.\r\n\r\nVarious portents had occurred at this time, but so sunk in              13\r\nsuperstition are the Jews and so opposed to all religious practices\r\nthat they think it wicked to avert the threatened evil by\r\nsacrifices[516] or vows. Embattled armies were seen to meet in the sky\r\nwith flashing arms, and the temple shone with sudden fire from heaven.\r\nThe doors of the shrine suddenly opened, a supernatural voice was\r\nheard calling the gods out, and at once there began a mighty movement\r\nof departure. Few took alarm at all this. Most people held the belief\r\nthat, according to the ancient priestly writings, this was the moment\r\nat which the East was fated to prevail: they would now start forth\r\nfrom Judaea and conquer the world.[517] This enigmatic prophecy really\r\napplied to Vespasian and Titus. But men are blinded by their hopes.\r\nThe Jews took to themselves the promised destiny, and even defeat\r\ncould not convince them of the truth. The number of the besieged, men\r\nand women of every age, is stated to have reached six hundred\r\nthousand. There were arms for all who could carry them, and far more\r\nwere ready to fight than would be expected from their total numbers.\r\nThe women were as determined as the men: if they were forced to leave\r\ntheir homes they had more to fear in life than in death.\r\n\r\nSuch was the city and such the people with which Titus was faced. As\r\nthe nature of the ground forbade a sudden assault, he determined to\r\nemploy siege-works and penthouse shelters. The work was accordingly\r\ndivided among the legions, and there was a truce to fighting until\r\nthey had got ready every means of storming a town that had ever been\r\ndevised by experience or inventive ingenuity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [460] A.D. 70.\r\n\r\n    [461] See ii. 4; iv. 51.\r\n\r\n    [462] XXII Deiotariana and III Cyrenaica.\r\n\r\n    [463] Cp. ii. 4.\r\n\r\n    [464] There seems little to recommend Tacitus' theory of the\r\n          identity of the Idaei and Judaei, though it has been suggested\r\n          that the Cherethites of 2.

Lev. xvi. 3, 'a young bullock for a sin offering,\r\n          and a ram for a burnt offering.'

They\r\n          numbered at this time about four millions. Romans naturally\r\n          regarded this diversion of funds with disfavour.\r\n\r\n    [480] Jewish exclusiveness always roused Roman indignation,\r\n          and 'hatred of the human race' was the usual charge against\r\n          Christians (see _Ann._ xv. 44).\r\n\r\n    [481] The strict regulations of Deut. xxii. &c. give a strange\r\n          irony to this slander. Most of these libels originated in\r\n          Alexandria.\r\n\r\n    [482] 'A people,' says the elder Pliny, 'distinguished by\r\n          their contemptuous atheism.'\r\n\r\n    [483] _Agnati_, as used here and in _Germ._ 19 means a child\r\n          born after the father has made his will and therein specified\r\n          the number of his children. The mere birth of such a child\r\n          invalidated any earlier will that the father had made, but the\r\n          fact of its birth might be concealed by making away with the\r\n          baby. This crime seems to have been not uncommon, but there is\r\n          no evidence that 'exposure of infants' was permitted.\r\n\r\n    [484] Josephus also alludes to this belief that the corruption\r\n          of disease chained the soul to the buried body, while violent\r\n          death freed it to live for ever in the air and protect\r\n          posterity.\r\n\r\n    [485] Under the kings cremation was an honourable form of\r\n          burial, but in Babylon the Jews came to regard fire as a\r\n          sacred element which should not be thus defiled.\r\n\r\n    [486] This was over the door of the Temple. Aristobulus gave\r\n          it as a present to Pompey.\r\n\r\n    [487] Plutarch shared this error, which seems somehow to have\r\n          been based on a misinterpretation of the Feast of Tabernacles,\r\n          at which they were to 'take ... the fruit of goodly trees, ...\r\n          and willows of the brook; and ... rejoice before the Lord your\r\n          God seven days' (Lev. xxiii. 40).\r\n\r\n    [488] Over Coele-Syria, from the range of Lebanon.\r\n\r\n    [489] i.e. from Mount Hermon, nearly 9,000 feet high.\r\n\r\n    [490] Merom; Gennesareth; the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\n    [491] 'Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah\r\n          brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven; and he\r\n          overthrew those cities, and all the Plain' (Gen. xix. 24).\r\n\r\n    [492] These were not concentric, but an enemy approaching from\r\n          the north-west would have to carry all three before reaching\r\n          the temple, which stood on Mount Moriah at the eastern\r\n          extremity of the city.\r\n\r\n    [493] Cp.

The position was a safe\r\none, and he hoped to inspirit his native troops with the memory of\r\ntheir former victories there.[519] Cerialis followed in his footsteps,\r\nwith forces now doubled by the arrival of the Second,[520] Thirteenth,\r\nand Fourteenth legions, besides auxiliary troops, both horse and\r\nfoot,[521] who had long received their summons and came hurrying on\r\nthe news of victory. Neither general was dilatory, but a vast plain\r\nlay between them. It was by nature swampy, and Civilis had built a dam\r\nprojecting into the Rhine, which stemmed the current and flooded the\r\nadjacent fields. The treacherous nature of the ground, where the\r\nshallows were hard to find, told against our men, who were heavily\r\narmed and afraid of swimming. The Germans, on the other hand, were\r\nused to rivers, lightly armed, and tall enough to keep their heads\r\nabove water.\r\n\r\nProvoked by the Batavi, the bravest of our troops opened the            15\r\nengagement at once, but soon fell into a panic when their arms and\r\nhorses began to sink in the deep marshes. The Germans, who knew the\r\nfords, came leaping across them, often leaving our front alone and\r\nrunning round to the flanks or the rear. It was not like an infantry\r\nengagement at close quarters, but more like a naval battle. The men\r\nfloundered about in the water or, finding firm foothold, strove with\r\nall their might for possession of it. Thus, wounded and whole, those\r\nwho could swim and those who could not, struggled helplessly with each\r\nother and perished all alike. However, considering the confusion, our\r\nloss was less than might have been expected, for the Germans, not\r\ndaring to venture out of the marsh, withdrew to their camp. The result\r\nof this engagement gave each of the generals a different motive for\r\nhastening on a decisive battle. Civilis wanted to follow up his\r\nsuccess, Cerialis to wipe out his disgrace. Success stimulated the\r\npride of the Germans; the Romans thrilled with shame. The natives\r\nspent the night singing uproariously, while our men muttered angry\r\nthreats.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak Cerialis formed up his cavalry and the auxiliary            16\r\ncohorts on his front, with the legions behind them, while he himself\r\nheld a picked body in reserve for emergencies. Civilis did not deploy\r\nhis line, but halted them in columns,[522] with the Batavi and\r\nCugerni[523] on his right, and the forces from across the Rhine[524]\r\nnear the river on the left. Neither general followed the usual custom\r\nof haranguing the whole army. They rode along and addressed their\r\nvarious divisions in turn. Cerialis spoke of the ancient glory of the\r\nRoman name and of all their victories old and new. He urged them 'to\r\nblot out for ever their treacherous and cowardly enemy whom they had\r\nalready beaten. They had to punish not to fight them. They had just\r\nfought against superior numbers and had yet routed the Germans, and,\r\nmoreover, the pick of their troops. This remnant had their hearts full\r\nof panic and all their wounds behind them.' He then gave special\r\nencouragement to each of the legions, calling the Fourteenth the\r\nconquerors of Britain,[525] reminding the Sixth that the influence of\r\ntheir example had set Galba on the throne,[526] and telling the Second\r\nthat in the coming fight they would for the first time dedicate their\r\nnew colours and their new eagle to Rome's service.[527] Then riding\r\nalong to the German army,[528] he pointed with his hand and bade them\r\nrecover their own river-bank and their own camp[529] at the enemy's\r\nexpense. They all cheered with hearts the lighter for his words. Some\r\nlonged for battle after a long spell of quiet: others were weary of\r\nwar and pined for peace, hoping that the future would bring them rest\r\nand recompense.\r\n\r\nNor was there silence in Civilis' lines. As he formed them up he        17\r\nappealed to the spot as evidence of their valour. The Germans and\r\nBatavians were standing, he told them, 'on the field of their glory,\r\ntrampling the charred bones of Roman soldiers under foot. Wherever the\r\nRomans turned their eyes they saw nothing but menacing reminders of\r\nsurrender and defeat. They must not be alarmed by that sudden change\r\nof fortune in the battle at Trier. It was their own victory which\r\nhampered the Germans there: they had dropped their weapons and filled\r\ntheir hands with loot. Since then everything had gone in their favour\r\nand against the Romans. He had taken every possible precaution, as\r\nbefitted a cunning general. They themselves were familiar with these\r\nsoaking plains, but the swamps would be a deadly trap for the enemy.\r\nThey had the Rhine and the gods of Germany before their eyes, and in\r\nthe might of these they must go to battle, remembering their wives and\r\nparents and their fatherland. This day would either gild the glory of\r\ntheir ancestors or earn the execration of posterity.' They applauded\r\nhis words according to their custom by dancing and clashing their\r\narms, and then opened the battle with showers of stones and leaden\r\nballs and other missiles, trying to lure on our men, who had not yet\r\nentered the marsh.\r\n\r\nTheir missiles exhausted, the enemy warmed to their work and made       18\r\nan angry charge. Thanks to their great height and their very long\r\nspears they could thrust from some distance at our men, who were\r\nfloundering and slipping about in the marsh. While this went on, a\r\ncolumn[530] of Batavi swam across from the dam which, as we described\r\nabove,[531] had been built out into the Rhine. This started a panic\r\nand the line of our auxiliaries began to be driven back. Then the\r\nlegions took up the fight and equalized matters by staying the enemy's\r\nwild charge. Meanwhile a Batavian deserter approached Cerialis,\r\navowing that he could take the enemy in the rear if the cavalry were\r\nsent round the edge of the swamp: the ground was solid there, and the\r\nCugerni, whose task it was to keep watch, were off their guard. Two\r\nsquadrons of horse were sent with the deserter, and succeeded in\r\noutflanking the unsuspecting enemy. The legions in front, when the din\r\ntold them what had happened, redoubled their efforts. The Germans were\r\nbeaten and fled to the Rhine. This day might have brought the war to\r\nan end, had the Roman fleet[532] arrived in time. As it was, even the\r\ncavalry were prevented from pursuit by a sudden downpour of rain\r\nshortly before nightfall.\r\n\r\nOn the next day the Fourteenth legion were sent to join Annius          19\r\nGallus[533] in Upper Germany, and their place in Cerialis' army was\r\nfilled by the Tenth from Spain. Civilis was reinforced by the\r\nChauci.[534] Feeling that he was not strong enough to hold the\r\nBatavian capital,[535] he took whatever was portable with him, burnt\r\neverything else, and retired into the island. He knew that the Romans\r\nhad not enough ships to build a bridge, and that they had no other\r\nmeans of getting across. He also destroyed the mole built by Drusus\r\nGermanicus.[536] As the bed of the Rhine here falls towards Gaul, his\r\nremoval of all obstacles gave it free course; the river was\r\npractically diverted, and the channel between the Germans and the\r\nisland became so small and dry as to form no barrier between them.\r\nTutor and Classicus also crossed the Rhine,[537] together with a\r\nhundred and thirteen town-councillors from Trier, among whom was\r\nAlpinius Montanus, who, as we have already seen,[538] had been sent by\r\nAntonius Primus into Gaul. He was accompanied by his brother. By\r\narousing sympathy and by offering presents, the others, too, were all\r\nbusy raising reinforcements among these eagerly adventurous tribes.\r\n\r\nThe war was far from being over. Dividing his forces, Civilis           20\r\nsuddenly made a simultaneous attack on all four Roman garrisons--the\r\nTenth at Arenacum, the Second at Batavodurum, and the auxiliary horse\r\nand foot at Grinnes and at Vada.[539] Civilis himself, Verax his\r\nnephew, Classicus and Tutor each led one of the attacking parties.\r\nThey could not hope all to be successful, but reckoned that, if they\r\nmade several ventures, fortune would probably favour one or the other.\r\nBesides, Cerialis, they supposed, was off his guard; on receiving news\r\nfrom several places at once he would hurry from one garrison to\r\nanother, and might be cut off on his way. The party told off against\r\nthe Tenth considered it no light task to storm a legion, so they fell\r\non the soldiers, who had come outside to cut timber, and killed the\r\ncamp-prefect, five senior centurions, and a handful of the men. The\r\nrest defended themselves in the trenches. Meanwhile another party of\r\nGermans endeavoured to break the bridge[540] which had been begun at\r\nBatavodurum, but nightfall put an end to the battle before it was won.\r\n\r\nThe attack on Grinnes and Vada proved more formidable. Civilis led      21\r\nthe assault on Vada, Classicus on Grinnes. Nothing could stop them.\r\nThe bravest of the defenders had fallen, among them, commanding a\r\ncavalry squadron, Briganticus, whom we have seen already, as a\r\nfaithful ally of Rome and a bitter enemy of his uncle Civilis.[541]\r\nHowever, when Cerialis came to the rescue with a picked troop of\r\nhorse, the tables were turned, and the Germans were driven headlong\r\ninto the river. While Civilis was trying to stop the rout he was\r\nrecognized, and finding himself a target, he left his horse and swam\r\nacross the river. Verax escaped in the same way, while some boats put\r\nin to fetch Tutor and Classicus.\r\n\r\nEven now the Roman fleet had not joined the army. They had, indeed,\r\nreceived orders, but fear held them back, and the rowers were employed\r\non various duties elsewhere. It must be admitted, also, that Cerialis\r\ndid not give them time enough to carry out his orders. He was a man of\r\nsudden resolves and brilliant successes. Even when his strategy had\r\nfailed, good luck always came to his rescue. Thus neither he nor his\r\narmy cared much about discipline. A few days later, again, he narrowly\r\nescaped being taken prisoner and did not escape disgrace. He had        22\r\ngone to Novaesium and Bonn to inspect the winter quarters that were\r\nbeing built for his legions, and was returning with the fleet.[542]\r\nThe Germans noticed that his escort[543] straggled, and that watch was\r\ncarelessly kept at night. So they planned a surprise. Choosing a night\r\nblack with clouds they slipped down stream and made their way\r\nunmolested into the camp.[544] For the first onslaught they called\r\ncunning to their aid. They cut the tent-ropes and slaughtered the\r\nsoldiers as they struggled under their own canvas. Another party fell\r\non the ships, threw hawsers aboard, and towed them off. Having\r\nsurprised the camp in dead silence, when once the carnage began they\r\nadded to the panic by making the whole place ring with shouts.\r\nAwakened by their wounds the Romans hunted for weapons and rushed\r\nalong the streets,[545] some few in uniform, most of them with their\r\nclothes wrapped round their arms and a drawn sword in their hand. The\r\ngeneral, who was half-asleep and almost naked, was only saved by the\r\nenemy's mistake. His flag-ship being easily distinguishable, they\r\ncarried it off, thinking he was there. But Cerialis had been spending\r\nthe night elsewhere; as most people believed, carrying on an intrigue\r\nwith a Ubian woman named Claudia Sacrata. The sentries sheltered their\r\nguilt under the general's disgrace, pretending that they had orders to\r\nkeep quiet and not disturb him: so they had dispensed with the\r\nbugle-call and the challenge on rounds, and dropped off to sleep\r\nthemselves. In full daylight the enemy sailed off with their captive\r\nvessels and towed the flag-ship up the Lippe as an offering to\r\nVeleda.[546]\r\n\r\nCivilis was now seized with a desire to make a naval display. He        23\r\nmanned all the available biremes and all the ships with single banks\r\nof oars, and added to this fleet an immense number of small craft.\r\nThese carry thirty or forty men apiece and are rigged like Illyrian\r\ncruisers.[547] The small craft he had captured[548] were worked with\r\nbright, parti-coloured plaids, which served as sails and made a fine\r\nshow. He chose for review the miniature sea of water where the Rhine\r\ncomes pouring down to the ocean through the mouth of the Maas.[549]\r\nHis reason for the demonstration--apart from Batavian vanity--was to\r\nscare away the provision-convoys that were already on their way from\r\nGaul. Cerialis, who was less alarmed than astonished, at once formed\r\nup a fleet. Though inferior in numbers, he had the advantage of larger\r\nships, experienced rowers, and clever pilots. The Romans had the\r\nstream with them, the Germans the wind. So they sailed past each\r\nother, and after trying a few shots with light missiles they parted.\r\nCivilis without more ado retired across the Rhine.[550] Cerialis\r\nvigorously laid waste the island of the Batavi, and employed the\r\ncommon device of leaving Civilis's houses and fields untouched.[551]\r\nThey were now well into autumn. The heavy equinoctial rains had set\r\nthe river in flood and thus turned the marshy, low-lying island into a\r\nsort of lake. Neither fleet nor provision-convoys had arrived, and\r\ntheir camp on the flat plain began to be washed away by the force of\r\nthe current.\r\n\r\nCivilis afterwards claimed that at this point the Germans could         24\r\nhave crushed the Roman legions and wanted to do so, but that he had\r\ncunningly dissuaded them. Nor does this seem far from true, since his\r\nsurrender followed in a few days' time. Cerialis had been sending\r\nsecret messages, promising the Batavians peace and Civilis pardon,\r\nurging Veleda and her relatives[552] to change the fortune of a war\r\nthat had only brought disaster after disaster, by doing a timely\r\nservice to Rome.[553] 'The Treviri,' he reminded them, 'had been\r\nslaughtered; the allegiance of the Ubii recovered; the Batavians\r\nrobbed of their home. By supporting Civilis they had gained nothing\r\nbut bloodshed, banishment, and bereavement. He was a fugitive exile, a\r\nburden to those who harboured him. Besides, they had earned blame\r\nenough by crossing the Rhine so often: if they took any further\r\nsteps,--from the one side they might expect insult and injury, from\r\nthe other vengeance and the wrath of heaven.'\r\n\r\nThus Cerialis mingled threats and promises. The loyalty of the          25\r\ntribes across the Rhine was shaken, and murmurs began to make\r\nthemselves heard among the Batavi. 'How much further is our ruin to\r\ngo?' they asked. 'One tribe cannot free the whole world from the yoke.\r\nWhat good have we done by slaughtering and burning Roman legions\r\nexcept to bring out others, larger and stronger? If it was to help\r\nVespasian that we have fought so vigorously, Vespasian is master of\r\nthe world. If we are challenging Rome--what an infinitesimal fraction\r\nof the human race we Batavians are! We must remember what burdens\r\nRaetia and Noricum and all Rome's other allies bear. From us they levy\r\nno tribute, only our manhood and our men.[554] That is next door to\r\nfreedom. And, after all, if we have to choose our masters, it is less\r\ndisgrace to put up with Roman emperors than with German priestesses.'\r\nThus the common people: the chieftains used more violent language. 'It\r\nwas Civilis' lunacy that had driven them to war. He wanted to remedy\r\nhis private troubles[555] by ruining his country. The Batavians had\r\nincurred the wrath of heaven by blockading Roman legions, murdering\r\nRoman officers, and plunging into a war which was useful for one of\r\nthem and deadly for the rest. Now they had reached the limit, unless\r\nthey came to their senses and openly showed their repentance by\r\npunishing the culprit.'\r\n\r\nCivilis was well aware of their changed feelings and determined to      26\r\nforestall them. He was tired of hardship, and he felt, besides, that\r\ndesire to live which so often weakens the resolution of the bravest\r\nspirits. He demanded an interview. The bridge over the river\r\nNabalia[556] was broken down in the middle, and the two generals\r\nadvanced on to the broken ends. Civilis began as follows: 'If I were\r\ndefending myself before one of Vitellius' officers, I could expect\r\nneither pardon for my conduct nor credence for my words. Between him\r\nand me there has been nothing but hatred. He began the quarrel, I\r\nfostered it. Towards Vespasian I have from the beginning shown\r\nrespect. When he was a private citizen, we were known as friends.\r\nAntonius Primus was aware of this when he wrote urging me to take up\r\narms to prevent the legions from Germany and the Gallic levies from\r\ncrossing the Alps.[557] The instructions which Antonius gave in his\r\nletter Hordeonius Flaccus ratified by word of mouth. I raised the\r\nstandard in Germania, as did Mucianus in Syria, Aponius in Moesia,\r\nFlavianus in Pannonia....'\r\n\r\n[The rest is lost.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [518] iv. 78.\r\n\r\n    [519] Cp. iv. 28, 33, 35.\r\n\r\n    [520] Adiutrix.\r\n\r\n    [521] Before this Cerialis had five legions, I, IV, XVI, XXI,\r\n          and XXII, but of these only XXI was in full force, so these\r\n          new reinforcements may have doubled his army.
