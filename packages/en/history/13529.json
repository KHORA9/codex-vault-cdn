T. Mahan.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1918,\r\nby Ellen Lyle Mahan.\r\n\r\nPrinted in the United States of America\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe definite object proposed in this work is an examination of the\r\ngeneral history of Europe and America with particular reference to the\r\neffect of sea power upon the course of that history. Historians\r\ngenerally have been unfamiliar with the conditions of the sea, having\r\nas to it neither special interest nor special knowledge; and the\r\nprofound determining influence of maritime strength upon great issues\r\nhas consequently been overlooked. This is even more true of particular\r\noccasions than of the general tendency of sea power. It is easy to say\r\nin a general way, that the use and control of the sea is and has been\r\na great factor in the history of the world; it is more troublesome to\r\nseek out and show its exact bearing at a particular juncture. Yet,\r\nunless this be done, the acknowledgment of general importance remains\r\nvague and unsubstantial; not resting, as it should, upon a collection\r\nof special instances in which the precise effect has been made clear,\r\nby an analysis of the conditions at the given moments.\r\n\r\nA curious exemplification of this tendency to slight the bearing of\r\nmaritime power upon events may be drawn from two writers of that\r\nEnglish nation which more than any other has owed its greatness to the\r\nsea. \"Twice,\" says Arnold in his History of Rome, \"Has there been\r\nwitnessed the struggle of the highest individual genius against the\r\nresources and institutions of a great nation, and in both cases the\r\nnation was victorious. For seventeen years Hannibal strove against\r\nRome, for sixteen years Napoleon strove against England; the efforts\r\nof the first ended in Zama, those of the second in Waterloo.\" Sir\r\nEdward Creasy, quoting this, adds: \"One point, however, of the\r\nsimilitude between the two wars has scarcely been adequately dwelt on;\r\nthat is, the remarkable parallel between the Roman general who finally\r\ndefeated the great Carthaginian, and the English general who gave the\r\nlast deadly overthrow to the French emperor. Scipio and Wellington\r\nboth held for many years commands of high importance, but distant from\r\nthe main theatres of warfare. The same country was the scene of the\r\nprincipal military career of each. It was in Spain that Scipio, like\r\nWellington, successively encountered and overthrew nearly all the\r\nsubordinate generals of the enemy before being opposed to the chief\r\nchampion and conqueror himself. Both Scipio and Wellington restored\r\ntheir countrymen's confidence in arms when shaken by a series of\r\nreverses, and each of them closed a long and perilous war by a\r\ncomplete and overwhelming defeat of the chosen leader and the chosen\r\nveterans of the foe.\"\r\n\r\nNeither of these Englishmen mentions the yet more striking\r\ncoincidence, that in both cases the mastery of the sea rested with the\r\nvictor. The Roman control of the water forced Hannibal to that long,\r\nperilous march through Gaul in which more than half his veteran troops\r\nwasted away; it enabled the elder Scipio, while sending his army from\r\nthe Rhone on to Spain, to intercept Hannibal's communications, to\r\nreturn in person and face the invader at the Trebia. Throughout the\r\nwar the legions passed by water, unmolested and unwearied, between\r\nSpain, which was Hannibal's base, and Italy, while the issue of the\r\ndecisive battle of the Metaurus, hinging as it did upon the interior\r\nposition of the Roman armies with reference to the forces of Hasdrubal\r\nand Hannibal, was ultimately due to the fact that the younger brother\r\ncould not bring his succoring reinforcements by sea, but only by the\r\nland route through Gaul. Hence at the critical moment the two\r\nCarthaginian armies were separated by the length of Italy, and one was\r\ndestroyed by the combined action of the Roman generals.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, naval historians have troubled themselves little\r\nabout the connection between general history and their own particular\r\ntopic, limiting themselves generally to the duty of simple chroniclers\r\nof naval occurrences. This is less true of the French than of the\r\nEnglish; the genius and training of the former people leading them to\r\nmore careful inquiry into the causes of particular results and the\r\nmutual relation of events.\r\n\r\nThere is not, however, within the knowledge of the author any work\r\nthat professes the particular object here sought; namely, an estimate\r\nof the effect of sea power upon the course of history and the\r\nprosperity of nations. As other histories deal with the wars,\r\npolitics, social and economical conditions of countries, touching upon\r\nmaritime matters only incidentally and generally unsympathetically, so\r\nthe present work aims at putting maritime interests in the foreground,\r\nwithout divorcing them, however, from their surroundings of cause and\r\neffect in general history, but seeking to show how they modified the\r\nlatter, and were modified by them.\r\n\r\nThe period embraced is from 1660, when the sailing-ship era, with its\r\ndistinctive features, had fairly begun, to 1783, the end of the\r\nAmerican Revolution. While the thread of general history upon which\r\nthe successive maritime events is strung is intentionally slight, the\r\neffort has been to present a clear as well as accurate outline.\r\nWriting as a naval officer in full sympathy with his profession, the\r\nauthor has not hesitated to digress freely on questions of naval\r\npolicy, strategy, and tactics; but as technical language has been\r\navoided, it is hoped that these matters, simply presented, will be\r\nfound of interest to the unprofessional reader.\r\n\r\n                                                 A.

The profound influence of sea\r\ncommerce upon the wealth and strength of countries was clearly seen\r\nlong before the true principles which governed its growth and\r\nprosperity were detected. To secure to one's own people a\r\ndisproportionate share of such benefits, every effort was made to\r\nexclude others, either by the peaceful legislative methods of monopoly\r\nor prohibitory regulations, or, when these failed, by direct violence.\r\nThe clash of interests, the angry feelings roused by conflicting\r\nattempts thus to appropriate the larger share, if not the whole, of\r\nthe advantages of commerce, and of distant unsettled commercial\r\nregions, led to wars. On the other hand, wars arising from other\r\ncauses have been greatly modified in their conduct and issue by the\r\ncontrol of the sea. Therefore the history of sea power, while\r\nembracing in its broad sweep all that tends to make a people great\r\nupon the sea or by the sea, is largely a military history; and it is\r\nin this aspect that it will be mainly, though not exclusively,\r\nregarded in the following pages.\r\n\r\nA study of the military history of the past, such as this, is enjoined\r\nby great military leaders as essential to correct ideas and to the\r\nskilful conduct of war in the future. Napoleon names among the\r\ncampaigns to be studied by the aspiring soldier, those of Alexander,\r\nHannibal, and Cæsar, to whom gunpowder was unknown; and there is a\r\nsubstantial agreement among professional writers that, while many of\r\nthe conditions of war vary from age to age with the progress of\r\nweapons, there are certain teachings in the school of history which\r\nremain constant, and being, therefore, of universal application, can\r\nbe elevated to the rank of general principles. For the same reason the\r\nstudy of the sea history of the past will be found instructive, by its\r\nillustration of the general principles of maritime war,\r\nnotwithstanding the great changes that have been brought about in\r\nnaval weapons by the scientific advances of the past half century, and\r\nby the introduction of steam as the motive power.\r\n\r\nIt is doubly necessary thus to study critically the history and\r\nexperience of naval warfare in the days of sailing-ships, because\r\nwhile these will be found to afford lessons of present application and\r\nvalue, steam navies have as yet made no history which can be quoted as\r\ndecisive in its teaching. Of the one we have much experimental\r\nknowledge; of the other, practically none. Hence theories about the\r\nnaval warfare of the future are almost wholly presumptive; and\r\nalthough the attempt has been made to give them a more solid basis by\r\ndwelling upon the resemblance between fleets of steamships and fleets\r\nof galleys moved by oars, which have a long and well-known history, it\r\nwill be well not to be carried away by this analogy until it has been\r\nthoroughly tested. The resemblance is indeed far from superficial. The\r\nfeature which the steamer and the galley have in common is the ability\r\nto move in any direction independent of the wind. Such a power makes a\r\nradical distinction between those classes of vessels and the\r\nsailing-ship; for the latter can follow only a limited number of\r\ncourses when the wind blows, and must remain motionless when it fails.\r\nBut while it is wise to observe things that are alike, it is also wise\r\nto look for things that differ; for when the imagination is carried\r\naway by the detection of points of resemblance,--one of the most\r\npleasing of mental pursuits,--it is apt to be impatient of any\r\ndivergence in its new-found parallels, and so may overlook or refuse\r\nto recognize such. Thus the galley and the steamship have in common,\r\nthough unequally developed, the important characteristic mentioned,\r\nbut in at least two points they differ; and in an appeal to the\r\nhistory of the galley for lessons as to fighting steamships, the\r\ndifferences as well as the likeness must be kept steadily in view, or\r\nfalse deductions may be made. The motive power of the galley when in\r\nuse necessarily and rapidly declined, because human strength could not\r\nlong maintain such exhausting efforts, and consequently tactical\r\nmovements could continue but for a limited time;[1] and again, during\r\nthe galley period offensive weapons were not only of short range, but\r\nwere almost wholly confined to hand-to-hand encounter. These two\r\nconditions led almost necessarily to a rush upon each other, not,\r\nhowever, without some dexterous attempts to turn or double on the\r\nenemy, followed by a hand-to-hand _mêlée_. In such a rush and such a\r\n_mêlée_ a great consensus of respectable, even eminent, naval opinion\r\nof the present day finds the necessary outcome of modern naval\r\nweapons,--a kind of Donnybrook Fair, in which, as the history of\r\n_mêlées_ shows, it will be hard to know friend from foe. Whatever may\r\nprove to be the worth of this opinion, it cannot claim an historical\r\nbasis in the sole fact that galley and steamship can move at any\r\nmoment directly upon the enemy, and carry a beak upon their prow,\r\nregardless of the points in which galley and steamship differ. As yet\r\nthis opinion is only a presumption, upon which final judgment may well\r\nbe deferred until the trial of battle has given further light. Until\r\nthat time there is room for the opposite view,--that a _mêlée_\r\nbetween numerically equal fleets, in which skill is reduced to a\r\nminimum, is not the best that can be done with the elaborate and\r\nmighty weapons of this age. The surer of himself an admiral is, the\r\nfiner the tactical development of his fleet, the better his captains,\r\nthe more reluctant must he necessarily be to enter into a _mêlée_ with\r\nequal forces, in which all these advantages will be thrown away,\r\nchance reign supreme, and his fleet be placed on terms of equality\r\nwith an assemblage of ships which have never before acted together.[2]\r\nHistory has lessons as to when _mêlées_ are, or are not, in order.\r\n\r\nThe galley, then, has one striking resemblance to the steamer, but\r\ndiffers in other important features which are not so immediately\r\napparent and are therefore less accounted of. In the sailing-ship, on\r\nthe contrary, the striking feature is the difference between it and\r\nthe more modern vessel; the points of resemblance, though existing and\r\neasy to find, are not so obvious, and therefore are less heeded. This\r\nimpression is enhanced by the sense of utter weakness in the\r\nsailing-ship as compared with the steamer, owing to its dependence\r\nupon the wind; forgetting that, as the former fought with its equals,\r\nthe tactical lessons are valid. The galley was never reduced to\r\nimpotence by a calm, and hence receives more respect in our day than\r\nthe sailing-ship; yet the latter displaced it and remained supreme\r\nuntil the utilization of steam. The powers to injure an enemy from a\r\ngreat distance, to manoeuvre for an unlimited length of time without\r\nwearing out the men, to devote the greater part of the crew to the\r\noffensive weapons instead of to the oar, are common to the sailing\r\nvessel and the steamer, and are at least as important, tactically\r\nconsidered, as the power of the galley to move in a calm or against\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nIn tracing resemblances there is a tendency not only to overlook\r\npoints of difference, but to exaggerate points of likeness,--to be\r\nfanciful. It may be so considered to point out that as the\r\nsailing-ship had guns of long range, with comparatively great\r\npenetrative power, and carronades, which were of shorter range but\r\ngreat smashing effect, so the modern steamer has its batteries of\r\nlong-range guns and of torpedoes, the latter being effective only\r\nwithin a limited distance and then injuring by smashing, while the\r\ngun, as of old, aims at penetration. Yet these are distinctly tactical\r\nconsiderations, which must affect the plans of admirals and captains;\r\nand the analogy is real, not forced. So also both the sailing-ship and\r\nthe steamer contemplate direct contact with an enemy's vessel,--the\r\nformer to carry her by boarding, the latter to sink her by ramming;\r\nand to both this is the most difficult of their tasks, for to effect\r\nit the ship must be carried to a single point of the field of action,\r\nwhereas projectile weapons may be used from many points of a wide\r\narea.\r\n\r\nThe relative positions of two sailing-ships, or fleets, with reference\r\nto the direction of the wind involved most important tactical\r\nquestions, and were perhaps the chief care of the seamen of that age.\r\nTo a superficial glance it may appear that since this has become a\r\nmatter of such indifference to the steamer, no analogies to it are to\r\nbe found in present conditions, and the lessons of history in this\r\nrespect are valueless. A more careful consideration of the\r\ndistinguishing characteristics of the lee and the weather \"gage,\"[3]\r\ndirected to their essential features and disregarding secondary\r\ndetails, will show that this is a mistake. The distinguishing feature\r\nof the weather-gage was that it conferred the power of giving or\r\nrefusing battle at will, which in turn carries the usual advantage of\r\nan offensive attitude in the choice of the method of attack. This\r\nadvantage was accompanied by certain drawbacks, such as irregularity\r\nintroduced into the order, exposure to raking or enfilading cannonade,\r\nand the sacrifice of part or all of the artillery-fire of the\r\nassailant,--all which were incurred in approaching the enemy. The\r\nship, or fleet, with the lee-gage could not attack; if it did not wish\r\nto retreat, its action was confined to the defensive, and to receiving\r\nbattle on the enemy's terms. This disadvantage was compensated by the\r\ncomparative ease of maintaining the order of battle undisturbed, and\r\nby a sustained artillery-fire to which the enemy for a time was unable\r\nto reply. Historically, these favorable and unfavorable\r\ncharacteristics have their counterpart and analogy in the offensive\r\nand defensive operations of all ages. The offence undertakes certain\r\nrisks and disadvantages in order to reach and destroy the enemy; the\r\ndefence, so long as it remains such, refuses the risks of advance,\r\nholds on to a careful, well-ordered position, and avails itself of the\r\nexposure to which the assailant submits himself. These radical\r\ndifferences between the weather and the lee gage were so clearly\r\nrecognized, through the cloud of lesser details accompanying them,\r\nthat the former was ordinarily chosen by the English, because their\r\nsteady policy was to assail and destroy their enemy; whereas the\r\nFrench sought the lee-gage, because by so doing they were usually able\r\nto cripple the enemy as he approached, and thus evade decisive\r\nencounters and preserve their ships. The French, with rare exceptions,\r\nsubordinated the action of the navy to other military considerations,\r\ngrudged the money spent upon it, and therefore sought to economize\r\ntheir fleet by assuming a defensive position and limiting its efforts\r\nto the repelling of assaults. For this course the lee-gage, skilfully\r\nused, was admirably adapted so long as an enemy displayed more courage\r\nthan conduct; but when Rodney showed an intention to use the advantage\r\nof the wind, not merely to attack, but to make a formidable\r\nconcentration on a part of the enemy's line, his wary opponent, De\r\nGuichen, changed his tactics. In the first of their three actions the\r\nFrenchman took the lee-gage; but after recognizing Rodney's purpose he\r\nmanoeuvred for the advantage of the wind, not to attack, but to refuse\r\naction except on his own terms. The power to assume the offensive, or\r\nto refuse battle, rests no longer with the wind, but with the party\r\nwhich has the greater speed; which in a fleet will depend not only\r\nupon the speed of the individual ships, but also upon their tactical\r\nuniformity of action. Henceforth the ships which have the greatest\r\nspeed will have the weather-gage.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore a vain expectation, as many think, to look for\r\nuseful lessons in the history of sailing-ships as well as in that of\r\ngalleys. Both have their points of resemblance to the modern ship;\r\nboth have also points of essential difference, which make it\r\nimpossible to cite their experiences or modes of action as tactical\r\n_precedents_ to be followed. But a precedent is different from and\r\nless valuable than a principle. The former may be originally faulty,\r\nor may cease to apply through change of circumstances; the latter has\r\nits root in the essential nature of things, and, however various its\r\napplication as conditions change, remains a standard to which action\r\nmust conform to attain success. War has such principles; their\r\nexistence is detected by the study of the past, which reveals them in\r\nsuccesses and in failures, the same from age to age. Conditions and\r\nweapons change; but to cope with the one or successfully wield the\r\nothers, respect must be had to these constant teachings of history in\r\nthe tactics of the battlefield, or in those wider operations of war\r\nwhich are comprised under the name of strategy.\r\n\r\nIt is however in these wider operations, which embrace a whole theatre\r\nof war, and in a maritime contest may cover a large portion of the\r\nglobe, that the teachings of history have a more evident and permanent\r\nvalue, because the conditions remain more permanent. The theatre of\r\nwar may be larger or smaller, its difficulties more or less\r\npronounced, the contending armies more or less great, the necessary\r\nmovements more or less easy, but these are simply differences of\r\nscale, of degree, not of kind. As a wilderness gives place to\r\ncivilization, as means of communication multiply, as roads are opened,\r\nrivers bridged, food-resources increased, the operations of war become\r\neasier, more rapid, more extensive; but the principles to which they\r\nmust be conformed remain the same. When the march on foot was replaced\r\nby carrying troops in coaches, when the latter in turn gave place to\r\nrailroads, the scale of distances was increased, or, if you will, the\r\nscale of time diminished; but the principles which dictated the point\r\nat which the army should be concentrated, the direction in which it\r\nshould move, the part of the enemy's position which it should assail,\r\nthe protection of communications, were not altered. So, on the sea,\r\nthe advance from the galley timidly creeping from port to port to the\r\nsailing-ship launching out boldly to the ends of the earth, and from\r\nthe latter to the steamship of our own time, has increased the scope\r\nand the rapidity of naval operations without necessarily changing the\r\nprinciples which should direct them; and the speech of Hermocrates\r\ntwenty-three hundred years ago, before quoted, contained a correct\r\nstrategic plan, which is as applicable in its principles now as it was\r\nthen. Before hostile armies or fleets are brought into con_tact_ (a\r\nword which perhaps better than any other indicates the dividing line\r\nbetween tactics and strategy), there are a number of questions to be\r\ndecided, covering the whole plan of operations throughout the theatre\r\nof war. Among these are the proper function of the navy in the war;\r\nits true objective; the point or points upon which it should be\r\nconcentrated; the establishment of depots of coal and supplies; the\r\nmaintenance of communications between these depots and the home base;\r\nthe military value of commerce-destroying as a decisive or a secondary\r\noperation of war; the system upon which commerce-destroying can be\r\nmost efficiently conducted, whether by scattered cruisers or by\r\nholding in force some vital centre through which commercial shipping\r\nmust pass. All these are strategic questions, and upon all these\r\nhistory has a great deal to say. There has been of late a valuable\r\ndiscussion in English naval circles as to the comparative merits of\r\nthe policies of two great English admirals, Lord Howe and Lord St.\r\nVincent, in the disposition of the English navy when at war with\r\nFrance. The question is purely strategic, and is not of mere\r\nhistorical interest; it is of vital importance now, and the principles\r\nupon which its decision rests are the same now as then. St. Vincent's\r\npolicy saved England from invasion, and in the hands of Nelson and his\r\nbrother admirals led straight up to Trafalgar.\r\n\r\nIt is then particularly in the field of naval strategy that the\r\nteachings of the past have a value which is in no degree lessened.\r\nThey are there useful not only as illustrative of principles, but also\r\nas precedents, owing to the comparative permanence of the conditions.\r\nThis is less obviously true as to tactics, when the fleets come into\r\ncollision at the point to which strategic considerations have brought\r\nthem. The unresting progress of mankind causes continual change in the\r\nweapons; and with that must come a continual change in the manner of\r\nfighting,--in the handling and disposition of troops or ships on the\r\nbattlefield. Hence arises a tendency on the part of many connected\r\nwith maritime matters to think that no advantage is to be gained from\r\nthe study of former experiences; that time so used is wasted. This\r\nview, though natural, not only leaves wholly out of sight those broad\r\nstrategic considerations which lead nations to put fleets afloat,\r\nwhich direct the sphere of their action, and so have modified and will\r\ncontinue to modify the history of the world, but is one-sided and\r\nnarrow even as to tactics. The battles of the past succeeded or failed\r\naccording as they were fought in conformity with the principles of\r\nwar; and the seaman who carefully studies the causes of success or\r\nfailure will not only detect and gradually assimilate these\r\nprinciples, but will also acquire increased aptitude in applying them\r\nto the tactical use of the ships and weapons of his own day. He will\r\nobserve also that changes of tactics have not only taken place _after_\r\nchanges in weapons, which necessarily is the case, but that the\r\ninterval between such changes has been unduly long. This doubtless\r\narises from the fact that an improvement of weapons is due to the\r\nenergy of one or two men, while changes in tactics have to overcome\r\nthe inertia of a conservative class; but it is a great evil. It can be\r\nremedied only by a candid recognition of each change, by careful study\r\nof the powers and limitations of the new ship or weapon, and by a\r\nconsequent adaptation of the method of using it to the qualities it\r\npossesses, which will constitute its tactics. History shows that it is\r\nvain to hope that military men generally will be at the pains to do\r\nthis, but that the one who does will go into battle with a great\r\nadvantage,--a lesson in itself of no mean value.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore accept now the words of a French tactician, Morogues,\r\nwho wrote a century and a quarter ago: \"Naval tactics are based upon\r\nconditions the chief causes of which, namely the arms, may change;\r\nwhich in turn causes necessarily a change in the construction of\r\nships, in the manner of handling them, and so finally in the\r\ndisposition and handling of fleets.\" His further statement, that \"it\r\nis not a science founded upon principles absolutely invariable,\" is\r\nmore open to criticism. It would be more correct to say that the\r\napplication of its principles varies as the weapons change. The\r\napplication of the principles doubtless varies also in strategy from\r\ntime to time, but the variation is far less; and hence the recognition\r\nof the underlying principle is easier. This statement is of sufficient\r\nimportance to our subject to receive some illustrations from\r\nhistorical events.\r\n\r\nThe battle of the Nile, in 1798, was not only an overwhelming victory\r\nfor the English over the French fleet, but had also the decisive\r\neffect of destroying the communications between France and Napoleon's\r\narmy in Egypt. In the battle itself the English admiral, Nelson, gave\r\na most brilliant example of grand tactics, if that be, as has been\r\ndefined, \"the art of making good combinations preliminary to battles\r\nas well as during their progress.\" The particular tactical combination\r\ndepended upon a condition now passed away, which was the inability of\r\nthe lee ships of a fleet at anchor to come to the help of the weather\r\nones before the latter were destroyed; but the principles which\r\nunderlay the combination, namely, to choose that part of the enemy's\r\norder which can least easily be helped, and to attack it with superior\r\nforces, has not passed away. The action of Admiral Jervis at Cape St.\r\nVincent, when with fifteen ships he won a victory over twenty-seven,\r\nwas dictated by the same principle, though in this case the enemy was\r\nnot at anchor, but under way. Yet men's minds are so constituted that\r\nthey seem more impressed by the transiency of the conditions than by\r\nthe undying principle which coped with them. In the strategic effect\r\nof Nelson's victory upon the course of the war, on the contrary, the\r\nprinciple involved is not only more easily recognized, but it is at\r\nonce seen to be applicable to our own day. The issue of the enterprise\r\nin Egypt depended upon keeping open the communications with France.\r\nThe victory of the Nile destroyed the naval force, by which alone the\r\ncommunications could be assured, and determined the final failure; and\r\nit is at once seen, not only that the blow was struck in accordance\r\nwith the principle of striking at the enemy's line of communication,\r\nbut also that the same principle is valid now, and would be equally so\r\nin the days of the galley as of the sailing-ship or steamer.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a vague feeling of contempt for the past, supposed to be\r\nobsolete, combines with natural indolence to blind men even to those\r\npermanent strategic lessons which lie close to the surface of naval\r\nhistory. For instance, how many look upon the battle of Trafalgar, the\r\ncrown of Nelson's glory and the seal of his genius, as other than an\r\nisolated event of exceptional grandeur? How many ask themselves the\r\nstrategic question, \"How did the ships come to be just there?\" How\r\nmany realize it to be the final act in a great strategic drama,\r\nextending over a year or more, in which two of the greatest leaders\r\nthat ever lived, Napoleon and Nelson, were pitted against each other?\r\nAt Trafalgar it was not Villeneuve that failed, but Napoleon that was\r\nvanquished; not Nelson that won, but England that was saved; and why?\r\nBecause Napoleon's combinations failed, and Nelson's intuitions and\r\nactivity kept the English fleet ever on the track of the enemy, and\r\nbrought it up in time at the decisive moment.[4] The tactics at\r\nTrafalgar, while open to criticism in detail, were in their main\r\nfeatures conformable to the principles of war, and their audacity was\r\njustified as well by the urgency of the case as by the results; but\r\nthe great lessons of efficiency in preparation, of activity and energy\r\nin execution, and of thought and insight on the part of the English\r\nleader during the previous months, are strategic lessons, and as such\r\nthey still remain good.\r\n\r\nIn these two cases events were worked out to their natural and\r\ndecisive end. A third may be cited, in which, as no such definite end\r\nwas reached, an opinion as to what should have been done may be open\r\nto dispute. In the war of the American Revolution, France and Spain\r\nbecame allies against England in 1779. The united fleets thrice\r\nappeared in the English Channel, once to the number of sixty-six sail\r\nof the line, driving the English fleet to seek refuge in its ports\r\nbecause far inferior in numbers. Now, the great aim of Spain was to\r\nrecover Gibraltar and Jamaica; and to the former end immense efforts\r\nboth by land and sea were put forth by the allies against that nearly\r\nimpregnable fortress. They were fruitless. The question suggested--and\r\nit is purely one of naval strategy--is this: Would not Gibraltar have\r\nbeen more surely recovered by controlling the English Channel,\r\nattacking the British fleet even in its harbors, and threatening\r\nEngland with annihilation of commerce and invasion at home, than by\r\nfar greater efforts directed against a distant and very strong outpost\r\nof her empire? The English people, from long immunity, were\r\nparticularly sensitive to fears of invasion, and their great\r\nconfidence in their fleets, if rudely shaken, would have left them\r\nproportionately disheartened. However decided, the question as a point\r\nof strategy is fair; and it is proposed in another form by a French\r\nofficer of the period, who favored directing the great effort on a\r\nWest India island which might be exchanged against Gibraltar. It is\r\nnot, however, likely that England would have given up the key of the\r\nMediterranean for any other foreign possession, though she might have\r\nyielded it to save her firesides and her capital. Napoleon once said\r\nthat he would reconquer Pondicherry on the banks of the Vistula. Could\r\nhe have controlled the English Channel, as the allied fleet did for a\r\nmoment in 1779, can it be doubted that he would have conquered\r\nGibraltar on the shores of England?\r\n\r\nTo impress more strongly the truth that history both suggests\r\nstrategic study and illustrates the principles of war by the facts\r\nwhich it transmits, two more instances will be taken, which are more\r\nremote in time than the period specially considered in this work. How\r\ndid it happen that, in two great contests between the powers of the\r\nEast and of the West in the Mediterranean, in one of which the empire\r\nof the known world was at stake, the opposing fleets met on spots so\r\nnear each other as Actium and Lepanto? Was this a mere coincidence, or\r\nwas it due to conditions that recurred, and may recur again?[5] If the\r\nlatter, it is worth while to study out the reason; for if there should\r\nagain arise a great eastern power of the sea like that of Antony or of\r\nTurkey, the strategic questions would be similar. At present, indeed,\r\nit seems that the centre of sea power, resting mainly with England and\r\nFrance, is overwhelmingly in the West; but should any chance add to\r\nthe control of the Black Sea basin, which Russia now has, the\r\npossession of the entrance to the Mediterranean, the existing\r\nstrategic conditions affecting sea power would all be modified. Now,\r\nwere the West arrayed against the East, England and France would go at\r\nonce unopposed to the Levant, as they did in 1854, and as England\r\nalone went in 1878; in case of the change suggested, the East, as\r\ntwice before, would meet the West half-way.\r\n\r\nAt a very conspicuous and momentous period of the world's history, Sea\r\nPower had a strategic bearing and weight which has received scant\r\nrecognition. There cannot now be had the full knowledge necessary for\r\ntracing in detail its influence upon the issue of the second Punic\r\nWar; but the indications which remain are sufficient to warrant the\r\nassertion that it was a determining factor. An accurate judgment upon\r\nthis point cannot be formed by mastering only such facts of the\r\nparticular contest as have been clearly transmitted, for as usual the\r\nnaval transactions have been slightingly passed over; there is needed\r\nalso familiarity with the details of general naval history in order to\r\ndraw, from slight indications, correct inferences based upon a\r\nknowledge of what has been possible at periods whose history is well\r\nknown. The control of the sea, however real, does not imply that an\r\nenemy's single ships or small squadrons cannot steal out of port,\r\ncannot cross more or less frequented tracts of ocean, make harassing\r\ndescents upon unprotected points of a long coast-line, enter blockaded\r\nharbors. On the contrary, history has shown that such evasions are\r\nalways possible, to some extent, to the weaker party, however great\r\nthe inequality of naval strength. It is not therefore inconsistent\r\nwith the general control of the sea, or of a decisive part of it, by\r\nthe Roman fleets, that the Carthaginian admiral Bomilcar in the fourth\r\nyear of the war, after the stunning defeat of Cannæ, landed four\r\nthousand men and a body of elephants in south Italy; nor that in the\r\nseventh year, flying from the Roman fleet off Syracuse, he again\r\nappeared at Tarentum, then in Hannibal's hands; nor that Hannibal sent\r\ndespatch vessels to Carthage; nor even that, at last, he withdrew in\r\nsafety to Africa with his wasted army. None of these things prove that\r\nthe government in Carthage could, if it wished, have sent Hannibal the\r\nconstant support which, as a matter of fact, he did not receive; but\r\nthey do tend to create a natural impression that such help could have\r\nbeen given. Therefore the statement, that the Roman preponderance at\r\nsea had a decisive effect upon the course of the war, needs to be made\r\ngood by an examination of ascertained facts. Thus the kind and degree\r\nof its influence may be fairly estimated.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: MEDITERRANEAN SEA]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war, Mommsen says, Rome controlled the seas.\r\nTo whatever cause, or combination of causes, it be attributed, this\r\nessentially non-maritime state had in the first Punic War established\r\nover its sea-faring rival a naval supremacy, which still lasted. In\r\nthe second war there was no naval battle of importance,--a\r\ncircumstance which in itself, and still more in connection with other\r\nwell-ascertained facts, indicates a superiority analogous to that\r\nwhich at other epochs has been marked by the same feature.\r\n\r\nAs Hannibal left no memoirs, the motives are unknown which determined\r\nhim to the perilous and almost ruinous march through Gaul and across\r\nthe Alps. It is certain, however, that his fleet on the coast of Spain\r\nwas not strong enough to contend with that of Rome. Had it been, he\r\nmight still have followed the road he actually did, for reasons that\r\nweighed with him; but had he gone by the sea, he would not have lost\r\nthirty-three thousand out of the sixty thousand veteran soldiers with\r\nwhom he started.\r\n\r\nWhile Hannibal was making this dangerous march, the Romans were\r\nsending to Spain, under the two elder Scipios, one part of their\r\nfleet, carrying a consular army. This made the voyage without serious\r\nloss, and the army established itself successfully north of the Ebro,\r\non Hannibal's line of communications. At the same time another\r\nsquadron, with an army commanded by the other consul, was sent to\r\nSicily. The two together numbered two hundred and twenty ships. On its\r\nstation each met and defeated a Carthaginian squadron with an ease\r\nwhich may be inferred from the slight mention made of the actions, and\r\nwhich indicates the actual superiority of the Roman fleet.\r\n\r\nAfter the second year the war assumed the following shape: Hannibal,\r\nhaving entered Italy by the north, after a series of successes had\r\npassed southward around Rome and fixed himself in southern Italy,\r\nliving off the country,--a condition which tended to alienate the\r\npeople, and was especially precarious when in contact with the mighty\r\npolitical and military system of control which Rome had there\r\nestablished. It was therefore from the first urgently necessary that\r\nhe should establish, between himself and some reliable base, that\r\nstream of supplies and reinforcements which in terms of modern war is\r\ncalled \"communications.\" There were three friendly regions which\r\nmight, each or all, serve as such a base,--Carthage itself, Macedonia,\r\nand Spain. With the first two, communication could be had only by sea.\r\nFrom Spain, where his firmest support was found, he could be reached\r\nby both land and sea, unless an enemy barred the passage; but the sea\r\nroute was the shorter and easier.\r\n\r\nIn the first years of the war, Rome, by her sea power, controlled\r\nabsolutely the basin between Italy, Sicily, and Spain, known as the\r\nTyrrhenian and Sardinian Seas. The sea-coast from the Ebro to the\r\nTiber was mostly friendly to her. In the fourth year, after the battle\r\nof Cannæ, Syracuse forsook the Roman alliance, the revolt spread\r\nthrough Sicily, and Macedonia also entered into an offensive league\r\nwith Hannibal. These changes extended the necessary operations of the\r\nRoman fleet, and taxed its strength. What disposition was made of it,\r\nand how did it thereafter influence the struggle?\r\n\r\nThe indications are clear that Rome at no time ceased to control the\r\nTyrrhenian Sea, for her squadrons passed unmolested from Italy to\r\nSpain. On the Spanish coast also she had full sway till the younger\r\nScipio saw fit to lay up the fleet. In the Adriatic, a squadron and\r\nnaval station were established at Brindisi to check Macedonia, which\r\nperformed their task so well that not a soldier of the phalanxes ever\r\nset foot in Italy. \"The want of a war fleet,\" says Mommsen, \"paralyzed\r\nPhilip in all his movements.\" Here the effect of Sea Power is not even\r\na matter of inference.\r\n\r\nIn Sicily, the struggle centred about Syracuse. The fleets of Carthage\r\nand Rome met there, but the superiority evidently lay with the latter;\r\nfor though the Carthaginians at times succeeded in throwing supplies\r\ninto the city, they avoided meeting the Roman fleet in battle. With\r\nLilybæum, Palermo, and Messina in its hands, the latter was well based\r\nin the north coast of the island. Access by the south was left open\r\nto the Carthaginians, and they were thus able to maintain the\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nPutting these facts together, it is a reasonable inference, and\r\nsupported by the whole tenor of the history, that the Roman sea power\r\ncontrolled the sea north of a line drawn from Tarragona in Spain to\r\nLilybæum (the modern Marsala), at the west end of Sicily, thence round\r\nby the north side of the island through the straits of Messina down to\r\nSyracuse, and from there to Brindisi in the Adriatic. This control\r\nlasted, unshaken, throughout the war. It did not exclude maritime\r\nraids, large or small, such as have been spoken of; but it did forbid\r\nthe sustained and secure communications of which Hannibal was in\r\ndeadly need.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it seems equally plain that for the first ten years\r\nof the war the Roman fleet was not strong enough for sustained\r\noperations in the sea between Sicily and Carthage, nor indeed much to\r\nthe south of the line indicated. When Hannibal started, he assigned\r\nsuch ships as he had to maintaining the communications between Spain\r\nand Africa, which the Romans did not then attempt to disturb.\r\n\r\nThe Roman sea power, therefore, threw Macedonia wholly out of the war.\r\nIt did not keep Carthage from maintaining a useful and most harassing\r\ndiversion in Sicily; but it did prevent her sending troops, when they\r\nwould have been most useful, to her great general in Italy. How was it\r\nas to Spain?\r\n\r\nSpain was the region upon which the father of Hannibal and Hannibal\r\nhimself had based their intended invasion of Italy. For eighteen years\r\nbefore this began they had occupied the country, extending and\r\nconsolidating their power, both political and military, with rare\r\nsagacity. They had raised, and trained in local wars, a large and now\r\nveteran army. Upon his own departure, Hannibal intrusted the\r\ngovernment to his younger brother, Hasdrubal, who preserved toward him\r\nto the end a loyalty and devotion which he had no reason to hope from\r\nthe faction-cursed mother-city in Africa.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his starting, the Carthaginian power in Spain was\r\nsecured from Cadiz to the river Ebro. The region between this river\r\nand the Pyrenees was inhabited by tribes friendly to the Romans, but\r\nunable, in the absence of the latter, to oppose a successful\r\nresistance to Hannibal. He put them down, leaving eleven thousand\r\nsoldiers under Hanno to keep military possession of the country, lest\r\nthe Romans should establish themselves there, and thus disturb his\r\ncommunications with his base.\r\n\r\nCnæus Scipio, however, arrived on the spot by sea the same year with\r\ntwenty thousand men, defeated Hanno, and occupied both the coast and\r\ninterior north of the Ebro. The Romans thus held ground by which they\r\nentirely closed the road between Hannibal and reinforcements from\r\nHasdrubal, and whence they could attack the Carthaginian power in\r\nSpain; while their own communications with Italy, being by water, were\r\nsecured by their naval supremacy. They made a naval base at Tarragona,\r\nconfronting that of Hasdrubal at Cartagena, and then invaded the\r\nCarthaginian dominions. The war in Spain went on under the elder\r\nScipios, seemingly a side issue, with varying fortune for seven years;\r\nat the end of which time Hasdrubal inflicted upon them a crushing\r\ndefeat, the two brothers were killed, and the Carthaginians nearly\r\nsucceeded in breaking through to the Pyrenees with reinforcements for\r\nHannibal. The attempt, however, was checked for the moment; and before\r\nit could be renewed, the fall of Capua released twelve thousand\r\nveteran Romans, who were sent to Spain under Claudius Nero, a man of\r\nexceptional ability, to whom was due later the most decisive military\r\nmovement made by any Roman general during the Second Punic War. This\r\nseasonable reinforcement, which again assured the shaken grip on\r\nHasdrubal's line of march, came by sea,--a way which, though most\r\nrapid and easy, was closed to the Carthaginians by the Roman navy.\r\n\r\nTwo years later the younger Publius Scipio, celebrated afterward as\r\nAfricanus, received the command in Spain, and captured Cartagena by a\r\ncombined military and naval attack; after which he took the most\r\nextraordinary step of breaking up his fleet and transferring the\r\nseamen to the army. Not contented to act merely as the \"containing\"[6]\r\nforce against Hasdrubal by closing the passes of the Pyrenees, Scipio\r\npushed forward into southern Spain, and fought a severe but indecisive\r\nbattle on the Guadalquivir; after which Hasdrubal slipped away from\r\nhim, hurried north, crossed the Pyrenees at their extreme west, and\r\npressed on to Italy, where Hannibal's position was daily growing\r\nweaker, the natural waste of his army not being replaced.\r\n\r\nThe war had lasted ten years, when Hasdrubal, having met little loss\r\non the way, entered Italy at the north. The troops he brought, could\r\nthey be safely united with those under the command of the unrivalled\r\nHannibal, might give a decisive turn to the war, for Rome herself was\r\nnearly exhausted; the iron links which bound her own colonies and the\r\nallied States to her were strained to the utmost, and some had already\r\nsnapped. But the military position of the two brothers was also\r\nperilous in the extreme. One being at the river Metaurus, the other in\r\nApulia, two hundred miles apart, each was confronted by a superior\r\nenemy, and both these Roman armies were between their separated\r\nopponents. This false situation, as well as the long delay of\r\nHasdrubal's coming, was due to the Roman control of the sea, which\r\nthroughout the war limited the mutual support of the Carthaginian\r\nbrothers to the route through Gaul. At the very time that Hasdrubal\r\nwas making his long and dangerous circuit by land, Scipio had sent\r\neleven thousand men from Spain by sea to reinforce the army opposed to\r\nhim. The upshot was that messengers from Hasdrubal to Hannibal, having\r\nto pass over so wide a belt of hostile country, fell into the hands of\r\nClaudius Nero, commanding the southern Roman army, who thus learned\r\nthe route which Hasdrubal intended to take. Nero correctly appreciated\r\nthe situation, and, escaping the vigilance of Hannibal, made a rapid\r\nmarch with eight thousand of his best troops to join the forces in the\r\nnorth. The junction being effected, the two consuls fell upon\r\nHasdrubal in overwhelming numbers and destroyed his army; the\r\nCarthaginian leader himself falling in the battle. Hannibal's first\r\nnews of the disaster was by the head of his brother being thrown into\r\nhis camp. He is said to have exclaimed that Rome would now be mistress\r\nof the world; and the battle of Metaurus is generally accepted as\r\ndecisive of the struggle between the two States.\r\n\r\nThe military situation which finally resulted in the battle of the\r\nMetaurus and the triumph of Rome may be summed up as follows: To\r\noverthrow Rome it was necessary to attack her in Italy at the heart of\r\nher power, and shatter the strongly linked confederacy of which she\r\nwas the head. This was the objective. To reach it, the Carthaginians\r\nneeded a solid base of operations and a secure line of communications.\r\nThe former was established in Spain by the genius of the great Barca\r\nfamily; the latter was never achieved. There were two lines\r\npossible,--the one direct by sea, the other circuitous through Gaul.\r\nThe first was blocked by the Roman sea power, the second imperilled\r\nand finally intercepted through the occupation of northern Spain by\r\nthe Roman army. This occupation was made possible through the control\r\nof the sea, which the Carthaginians never endangered. With respect to\r\nHannibal and his base, therefore, Rome occupied two central positions,\r\nRome itself and northern Spain, joined by an easy interior line of\r\ncommunications, the sea; by which mutual support was continually\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nHad the Mediterranean been a level desert of land, in which the Romans\r\nheld strong mountain ranges in Corsica and Sardinia, fortified posts\r\nat Tarragona, Lilybæum, and Messina, the Italian coast-line nearly to\r\nGenoa, and allied fortresses in Marseilles and other points; had they\r\nalso possessed an armed force capable by its character of traversing\r\nthat desert at will, but in which their opponents were very inferior\r\nand therefore compelled to a great circuit in order to concentrate\r\ntheir troops, the military situation would have been at once\r\nrecognized, and no words would have been too strong to express the\r\nvalue and effect of that peculiar force. It would have been perceived,\r\nalso, that the enemy's force of the same kind might, however inferior\r\nin strength, make an inroad, or raid, upon the territory thus held,\r\nmight burn a village or waste a few miles of borderland, might even\r\ncut off a convoy at times, without, in a military sense, endangering\r\nthe communications. Such predatory operations have been carried on in\r\nall ages by the weaker maritime belligerent, but they by no means\r\nwarrant the inference, irreconcilable with the known facts, \"that\r\nneither Rome nor Carthage could be said to have undisputed mastery of\r\nthe sea,\" because \"Roman fleets sometimes visited the coasts of\r\nAfrica, and Carthaginian fleets in the same way appeared off the coast\r\nof Italy.\" In the case under consideration, the navy played the part\r\nof such a force upon the supposed desert; but as it acts on an element\r\nstrange to most writers, as its members have been from time immemorial\r\na strange race apart, without prophets of their own, neither\r\nthemselves nor their calling understood, its immense determining\r\ninfluence upon the history of that era, and consequently upon the\r\nhistory of the world, has been overlooked. If the preceding argument\r\nis sound, it is as defective to omit sea power from the list of\r\nprincipal factors in the result, as it would be absurd to claim for it\r\nan exclusive influence.\r\n\r\nInstances such as have been cited, drawn from widely separated periods\r\nof time, both before and after that specially treated in this work,\r\nserve to illustrate the intrinsic interest of the subject, and the\r\ncharacter of the lessons which history has to teach. As before\r\nobserved, these come more often under the head of strategy than of\r\ntactics; they bear rather upon the conduct of campaigns than of\r\nbattles, and hence are fraught with more lasting value. To quote a\r\ngreat authority in this connection, Jomini says: \"Happening to be in\r\nParis near the end of 1851, a distinguished person did me the honor to\r\nask my opinion as to whether recent improvements in firearms would\r\ncause any great modifications in the way of making war. I replied that\r\nthey would probably have an influence upon the details of tactics, but\r\nthat in great strategic operations and the grand combinations of\r\nbattles, victory would, now as ever, result from the application of\r\nthe principles which had led to the success of great generals in all\r\nages; of Alexander and Cæsar, as well as of Frederick and Napoleon.\"\r\nThis study has become more than ever important now to navies, because\r\nof the great and steady power of movement possessed by the modern\r\nsteamer. The best-planned schemes might fail through stress of weather\r\nin the days of the galley and the sailing-ship; but this difficulty\r\nhas almost disappeared. The principles which should direct great naval\r\ncombinations have been applicable to all ages, and are deducible from\r\nhistory; but the power to carry them out with little regard to the\r\nweather is a recent gain.\r\n\r\nThe definitions usually given of the word \"strategy\" confine it to\r\nmilitary combinations embracing one or more fields of operations,\r\neither wholly distinct or mutually dependent, but always regarded as\r\nactual or immediate scenes of war. However this may be on shore, a\r\nrecent French author is quite right in pointing out that such a\r\ndefinition is too narrow for naval strategy. \"This,\" he says, \"differs\r\nfrom military strategy in that it is as necessary in peace as in war.\r\nIndeed, in peace it may gain its most decisive victories by occupying\r\nin a country, either by purchase or treaty, excellent positions which\r\nwould perhaps hardly be got by war. It learns to profit by all\r\nopportunities of settling on some chosen point of a coast, and to\r\nrender definitive an occupation which at first was only transient.\" A\r\ngeneration that has seen England within ten years occupy successively\r\nCyprus and Egypt, under terms and conditions on their face transient,\r\nbut which have not yet led to the abandonment of the positions taken,\r\ncan readily agree with this remark; which indeed receives constant\r\nillustration from the quiet persistency with which all the great sea\r\npowers are seeking position after position, less noted and less\r\nnoteworthy than Cyprus and Egypt, in the different seas to which their\r\npeople and their ships penetrate. \"Naval strategy has indeed for its\r\nend to found, support, and increase, as well in peace as in war, the\r\nsea power of a country;\" and therefore its study has an interest and\r\nvalue for all citizens of a free country, but especially for those who\r\nare charged with its foreign and military relations.\r\n\r\nThe general conditions that either are essential to or powerfully\r\naffect the greatness of a nation upon the sea will now be examined;\r\nafter which a more particular consideration of the various maritime\r\nnations of Europe at the middle of the seventeenth century, where the\r\nhistorical survey begins, will serve at once to illustrate and give\r\nprecision to the conclusions upon the general subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--The brilliancy of Nelson's fame, dimming as it does that\r\n    of all his contemporaries, and the implicit trust felt by\r\n    England in him as the one man able to save her from the schemes\r\n    of Napoleon, should not of course obscure the fact that only one\r\n    portion of the field was, or could be, occupied by him.\r\n    Napoleon's aim, in the campaign which ended at Trafalgar, was to\r\n    unite in the West Indies the French fleets of Brest, Toulon, and\r\n    Rochefort, together with a strong body of Spanish ships, thus\r\n    forming an overwhelming force which he intended should return\r\n    together to the English Channel and cover the crossing of the\r\n    French army. He naturally expected that, with England's\r\n    interests scattered all over the world, confusion and\r\n    distraction would arise from ignorance of the destination of the\r\n    French squadrons, and the English navy be drawn away from his\r\n    objective point. The portion of the field committed to Nelson\r\n    was the Mediterranean, where he watched the great arsenal of\r\n    Toulon and the highways alike to the East and to the Atlantic.\r\n    This was inferior in consequence to no other, and assumed\r\n    additional importance in the eyes of Nelson from his conviction\r\n    that the former attempts on Egypt would be renewed. Owing to\r\n    this persuasion he took at first a false step, which delayed his\r\n    pursuit of the Toulon fleet when it sailed under the command of\r\n    Villeneuve; and the latter was further favored by a long\r\n    continuance of fair winds, while the English had head winds. But\r\n    while all this is true, while the failure of Napoleon's\r\n    combinations must be attributed to the tenacious grip of the\r\n    English blockade off Brest, _as well as_ to Nelson's energetic\r\n    pursuit of the Toulon fleet when it escaped to the West Indies\r\n    and again on its hasty return to Europe, the latter is fairly\r\n    entitled to the eminent distinction which history has accorded\r\n    it, and which is asserted in the text. Nelson did not, indeed,\r\n    fathom the intentions of Napoleon. This may have been owing, as\r\n    some have said, to lack of insight; but it may be more simply\r\n    laid to the usual disadvantage under which the defence lies\r\n    before the blow has fallen, of ignorance as to the point\r\n    threatened by the offence. It is insight enough to fasten on the\r\n    key of a situation; and this Nelson rightly saw was the fleet,\r\n    not the station. Consequently, his action has afforded a\r\n    striking instance of how tenacity of purpose and untiring energy\r\n    in execution can repair a first mistake and baffle deeply laid\r\n    plans. His Mediterranean command embraced many duties and cares;\r\n    but amid and dominating them all, he saw clearly the Toulon\r\n    fleet as the controlling factor there, and an important factor\r\n    in any naval combination of the Emperor. Hence his attention was\r\n    unwaveringly fixed upon it; so much so that he called it \"his\r\n    fleet,\" a phrase which has somewhat vexed the sensibilities of\r\n    French critics. This simple and accurate view of the military\r\n    situation strengthened him in taking the fearless resolution and\r\n    bearing the immense responsibility of abandoning his station in\r\n    order to follow \"his fleet.\" Determined thus on a pursuit the\r\n    undeniable wisdom of which should not obscure the greatness of\r\n    mind that undertook it, he followed so vigorously as to reach\r\n    Cadiz on his return a week before Villeneuve entered Ferrol,\r\n    despite unavoidable delays arising from false information and\r\n    uncertainty as to the enemy's movements. The same untiring ardor\r\n    enabled him to bring up his own ships from Cadiz to Brest in\r\n    time to make the fleet there superior to Villeneuve's, had the\r\n    latter persisted in his attempt to reach the neighborhood. The\r\n    English, very inferior in aggregate number of vessels to the\r\n    allied fleets, were by this seasonable reinforcement of eight\r\n    veteran ships put into the best possible position strategically,\r\n    as will be pointed out in dealing with similar conditions in the\r\n    war of the American Revolution. Their forces were united in one\r\n    great fleet in the Bay of Biscay, interposed between the two\r\n    divisions of the enemy in Brest and Ferrol, superior in number\r\n    to either singly, and with a strong probability of being able to\r\n    deal with one before the other could come up. This was due to\r\n    able action all round on the part of the English authorities;\r\n    but above all other factors in the result stands Nelson's\r\n    single-minded pursuit of \"his fleet.\"\r\n\r\n    This interesting series of strategic movements ended on the 14th\r\n    of August, when Villeneuve, in despair of reaching Brest, headed\r\n    for Cadiz, where he anchored on the 20th. As soon as Napoleon\r\n    heard of this, after an outburst of rage against the admiral, he\r\n    at once dictated the series of movements which resulted in Ulm\r\n    and Austerlitz, abandoning his purposes against England. The\r\n    battle of Trafalgar, fought October 21, was therefore separated\r\n    by a space of two months from the extensive movements of which\r\n    it was nevertheless the outcome. Isolated from them in point of\r\n    time, it was none the less the seal of Nelson's genius, affixed\r\n    later to the record he had made in the near past. With equal\r\n    truth it is said that England was saved at Trafalgar, though the\r\n    Emperor had then given up his intended invasion; the destruction\r\n    there emphasized and sealed the strategic triumph which had\r\n    noiselessly foiled Napoleon's plans.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Thus Hermocrates of Syracuse, advocating the policy of thwarting\r\nthe Athenian expedition against his city (B.C. 413) by going boldly to\r\nmeet it, and keeping on the flank of its line of advance, said: \"As\r\ntheir advance must be slow, we shall have a thousand opportunities to\r\nattack them; but if they clear their ships for action and in a body\r\nbear down expeditiously upon us, they must ply hard at their oars, and\r\n_when spent with toil_ we can fall upon them.\"\r\n\r\n[2] The writer must guard himself from appearing to advocate elaborate\r\ntactical movements issuing in barren demonstrations. He believes that\r\na fleet seeking a decisive result must close with its enemy, but not\r\nuntil some advantage has been obtained for the collision, which will\r\nusually be gained by manoeuvring, and will fall to the best drilled\r\nand managed fleet. In truth, barren results have as often followed\r\nupon headlong, close encounters as upon the most timid tactical\r\ntrifling.\r\n\r\n[3] A ship was said to have the weather-gage, or \"the advantage of the\r\nwind,\" or \"to be to windward,\" when the wind allowed her to steer for\r\nher opponent, and did not let the latter head straight for her. The\r\nextreme case was when the wind blew direct from one to the other; but\r\nthere was a large space on either side of this line to which the term\r\n\"weather-gage\" applied. If the lee ship be taken as the centre of a\r\ncircle, there were nearly three eighths of its area in which the other\r\nmight be and still keep the advantage of the wind to a greater or less\r\ndegree. Lee is the opposite of weather.\r\n\r\n[4] See note at end of Introductory Chapter, page 23.\r\n\r\n[5] The battle of Navarino (1827) between Turkey and the Western\r\nPowers was fought in this neighborhood.\r\n\r\n[6] A \"containing\" force is one to which, in a military combination,\r\nis assigned the duty of stopping, or delaying the advance of a portion\r\nof the enemy, while the main effort of the army or armies is being\r\nexerted in a different quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION OF THE ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious light in which the sea presents itself from\r\nthe political and social point of view is that of a great highway; or\r\nbetter, perhaps, of a wide common, over which men may pass in all\r\ndirections, but on which some well-worn paths show that controlling\r\nreasons have led them to choose certain lines of travel rather than\r\nothers. These lines of travel are called trade routes; and the reasons\r\nwhich have determined them are to be sought in the history of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the familiar and unfamiliar dangers of the sea,\r\nboth travel and traffic by water have always been easier and cheaper\r\nthan by land. The commercial greatness of Holland was due not only to\r\nher shipping at sea, but also to the numerous tranquil water-ways\r\nwhich gave such cheap and easy access to her own interior and to that\r\nof Germany. This advantage of carriage by water over that by land was\r\nyet more marked in a period when roads were few and very bad, wars\r\nfrequent and society unsettled, as was the case two hundred years ago.\r\nSea traffic then went in peril of robbers, but was nevertheless safer\r\nand quicker than that by land. A Dutch writer of that time, estimating\r\nthe chances of his country in a war with England, notices among other\r\nthings that the water-ways of England failed to penetrate the country\r\nsufficiently; therefore, the roads being bad, goods from one part of\r\nthe kingdom to the other must go by sea, and be exposed to capture by\r\nthe way. As regards purely internal trade, this danger has generally\r\ndisappeared at the present day. In most civilized countries, now, the\r\ndestruction or disappearance of the coasting trade would only be an\r\ninconvenience, although water transit is still the cheaper.\r\nNevertheless, as late as the wars of the French Republic and the First\r\nEmpire, those who are familiar with the history of the period, and the\r\nlight naval literature that has grown up around it, know how constant\r\nis the mention of convoys stealing from point to point along the\r\nFrench coast, although the sea swarmed with English cruisers and there\r\nwere good inland roads.\r\n\r\nUnder modern conditions, however, home trade is but a part of the\r\nbusiness of a country bordering on the sea. Foreign necessaries or\r\nluxuries must be brought to its ports, either in its own or in foreign\r\nships, which will return, bearing in exchange the products of the\r\ncountry, whether they be the fruits of the earth or the works of men's\r\nhands; and it is the wish of every nation that this shipping business\r\nshould be done by its own vessels. The ships that thus sail to and fro\r\nmust have secure ports to which to return, and must, as far as\r\npossible, be followed by the protection of their country throughout\r\nthe voyage.\r\n\r\nThis protection in time of war must be extended by armed shipping. The\r\nnecessity of a navy, in the restricted sense of the word, springs,\r\ntherefore, from the existence of a peaceful shipping, and disappears\r\nwith it, except in the case of a nation which has aggressive\r\ntendencies, and keeps up a navy merely as a branch of the military\r\nestablishment. As the United States has at present no aggressive\r\npurposes, and as its merchant service has disappeared, the dwindling\r\nof the armed fleet and general lack of interest in it are strictly\r\nlogical consequences. When for any reason sea trade is again found to\r\npay, a large enough shipping interest will reappear to compel the\r\nrevival of the war fleet. It is possible that when a canal route\r\nthrough the Central-American Isthmus is seen to be a near certainty,\r\nthe aggressive impulse may be strong enough to lead to the same\r\nresult. This is doubtful, however, because a peaceful, gain-loving\r\nnation is not far-sighted, and far-sightedness is needed for adequate\r\nmilitary preparation, especially in these days.\r\n\r\nAs a nation, with its unarmed and armed shipping, launches forth from\r\nits own shores, the need is soon felt of points upon which the ships\r\ncan rely for peaceful trading, for refuge and supplies. In the present\r\nday friendly, though foreign, ports are to be found all over the\r\nworld; and their shelter is enough while peace prevails. It was not\r\nalways so, nor does peace always endure, though the United States have\r\nbeen favored by so long a continuance of it. In earlier times the\r\nmerchant seaman, seeking for trade in new and unexplored regions, made\r\nhis gains at risk of life and liberty from suspicious or hostile\r\nnations, and was under great delays in collecting a full and\r\nprofitable freight. He therefore intuitively sought at the far end of\r\nhis trade route one or more stations, to be given to him by force or\r\nfavor, where he could fix himself or his agents in reasonable\r\nsecurity, where his ships could lie in safety, and where the\r\nmerchantable products of the land could be continually collecting,\r\nawaiting the arrival of the home fleet, which should carry them to the\r\nmother-country. As there was immense gain, as well as much risk, in\r\nthese early voyages, such establishments naturally multiplied and grew\r\nuntil they became colonies; whose ultimate development and success\r\ndepended upon the genius and policy of the nation from which they\r\nsprang, and form a very great part of the history, and particularly of\r\nthe sea history, of the world. All colonies had not the simple and\r\nnatural birth and growth above described. Many were more formal, and\r\npurely political, in their conception and founding, the act of the\r\nrulers of the people rather than of private individuals; but the\r\ntrading-station with its after expansion, the work simply of the\r\nadventurer seeking gain, was in its reasons and essence the same as\r\nthe elaborately organized and chartered colony. In both cases the\r\nmother-country had won a foothold in a foreign land, seeking a new\r\noutlet for what it had to sell, a new sphere for its shipping, more\r\nemployment for its people, more comfort and wealth for itself.\r\n\r\nThe needs of commerce, however, were not all provided for when safety\r\nhad been secured at the far end of the road. The voyages were long\r\nand dangerous, the seas often beset with enemies. In the most active\r\ndays of colonizing there prevailed on the sea a lawlessness the very\r\nmemory of which is now almost lost, and the days of settled peace\r\nbetween maritime nations were few and far between. Thus arose the\r\ndemand for stations along the road, like the Cape of Good Hope, St.\r\nHelena, and Mauritius, not primarily for trade, but for defence and\r\nwar; the demand for the possession of posts like Gibraltar, Malta,\r\nLouisburg, at the entrance of the Gulf of St. Lawrence,--posts whose\r\nvalue was chiefly strategic, though not necessarily wholly so.\r\nColonies and colonial posts were sometimes commercial, sometimes\r\nmilitary in their character; and it was exceptional that the same\r\nposition was equally important in both points of view, as New York\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nIn these three things--production, with the necessity of exchanging\r\nproducts, shipping, whereby the exchange is carried on, and colonies,\r\nwhich facilitate and enlarge the operations of shipping and tend to\r\nprotect it by multiplying points of safety--is to be found the key to\r\nmuch of the history, as well as of the policy, of nations bordering\r\nupon the sea. The policy has varied both with the spirit of the age\r\nand with the character and clear-sightedness of the rulers; but the\r\nhistory of the seaboard nations has been less determined by the\r\nshrewdness and foresight of governments than by conditions of\r\nposition, extent, configuration, number and character of their\r\npeople,--by what are called, in a word, natural conditions. It must\r\nhowever be admitted, and will be seen, that the wise or unwise action\r\nof individual men has at certain periods had a great modifying\r\ninfluence upon the growth of sea power in the broad sense, which\r\nincludes not only the military strength afloat, that rules the sea or\r\nany part of it by force of arms, but also the peaceful commerce and\r\nshipping from which alone a military fleet naturally and healthfully\r\nsprings, and on which it securely rests.\r\n\r\nThe principal conditions affecting the sea power of nations may be\r\nenumerated as follows: I. Geographical Position. II. Physical\r\nConformation, including, as connected therewith, natural productions\r\nand climate. III. Extent of Territory. IV. Number of Population. V.\r\nCharacter of the People. VI. Character of the Government, including\r\ntherein the national institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Geographical Position._--It may be pointed out, in the first\r\nplace, that if a nation be so situated that it is neither forced to\r\ndefend itself by land nor induced to seek extension of its territory\r\nby way of the land, it has, by the very unity of its aim directed upon\r\nthe sea, an advantage as compared with a people one of whose\r\nboundaries is continental. This has been a great advantage to England\r\nover both France and Holland as a sea power. The strength of the\r\nlatter was early exhausted by the necessity of keeping up a large army\r\nand carrying on expensive wars to preserve her independence; while the\r\npolicy of France was constantly diverted, sometimes wisely and\r\nsometimes most foolishly, from the sea to projects of continental\r\nextension. These military efforts expended wealth; whereas a wiser and\r\nconsistent use of her geographical position would have added to it.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position may be such as of itself to promote a\r\nconcentration, or to necessitate a dispersion, of the naval forces.\r\nHere again the British Islands have an advantage over France. The\r\nposition of the latter, touching the Mediterranean as well as the\r\nocean, while it has its advantages, is on the whole a source of\r\nmilitary weakness at sea. The eastern and western French fleets have\r\nonly been able to unite after passing through the Straits of\r\nGibraltar, in attempting which they have often risked and sometimes\r\nsuffered loss. The position of the United States upon the two oceans\r\nwould be either a source of great weakness or a cause of enormous\r\nexpense, had it a large sea commerce on both coasts.\r\n\r\nEngland, by her immense colonial empire, has sacrificed much of this\r\nadvantage of concentration of force around her own shores; but the\r\nsacrifice was wisely made, for the gain was greater than the loss, as\r\nthe event proved. With the growth of her colonial system her war\r\nfleets also grew, but her merchant shipping and wealth grew yet\r\nfaster. Still, in the wars of the American Revolution, and of the\r\nFrench Republic and Empire, to use the strong expression of a French\r\nauthor, \"England, despite the immense development of her navy, seemed\r\never, in the midst of riches, to feel all the embarrassment of\r\npoverty.\" The might of England was sufficient to keep alive the heart\r\nand the members; whereas the equally extensive colonial empire of\r\nSpain, through her maritime weakness, but offered so many points for\r\ninsult and injury.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of a country may not only favor the\r\nconcentration of its forces, but give the further strategic advantage\r\nof a central position and a good base for hostile operations against\r\nits probable enemies. This again is the case with England; on the one\r\nhand she faces Holland and the northern powers, on the other France\r\nand the Atlantic. When threatened with a coalition between France and\r\nthe naval powers of the North Sea and the Baltic, as she at times was,\r\nher fleets in the Downs and in the Channel, and even that off Brest,\r\noccupied interior positions, and thus were readily able to interpose\r\ntheir united force against either one of the enemies which should seek\r\nto pass through the Channel to effect a junction with its ally. On\r\neither side, also, Nature gave her better ports and a safer coast to\r\napproach. Formerly this was a very serious element in the passage\r\nthrough the Channel; but of late, steam and the improvement of her\r\nharbors have lessened the disadvantage under which France once\r\nlabored. In the days of sailing-ships, the English fleet operated\r\nagainst Brest making its base at Torbay and Plymouth. The plan was\r\nsimply this: in easterly or moderate weather the blockading fleet kept\r\nits position without difficulty; but in westerly gales, when too\r\nsevere, they bore up for English ports, knowing that the French fleet\r\ncould not get out till the wind shifted, which equally served to bring\r\nthem back to their station.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of geographical nearness to an enemy, or to the object\r\nof attack, is nowhere more apparent than in that form of warfare\r\nwhich has lately received the name of commerce-destroying, which the\r\nFrench call _guerre de course_. This operation of war, being directed\r\nagainst peaceful merchant vessels which are usually defenceless, calls\r\nfor ships of small military force. Such ships, having little power to\r\ndefend themselves, need a refuge or point of support near at hand;\r\nwhich will be found either in certain parts of the sea controlled by\r\nthe fighting ships of their country, or in friendly harbors. The\r\nlatter give the strongest support, because they are always in the same\r\nplace, and the approaches to them are more familiar to the\r\ncommerce-destroyer than to his enemy. The nearness of France to\r\nEngland has thus greatly facilitated her _guerre de course_ directed\r\nagainst the latter. Having ports on the North Sea, on the Channel, and\r\non the Atlantic, her cruisers started from points near the focus of\r\nEnglish trade, both coming and going. The distance of these ports from\r\neach other, disadvantageous for regular military combinations, is an\r\nadvantage for this irregular secondary operation; for the essence of\r\nthe one is concentration of effort, whereas for commerce-destroying\r\ndiffusion of effort is the rule. Commerce-destroyers scatter, that\r\nthey may see and seize more prey. These truths receive illustration\r\nfrom the history of the great French privateers, whose bases and\r\nscenes of action were largely on the Channel and North Sea, or else\r\nwere found in distant colonial regions, where islands like Guadaloupe\r\nand Martinique afforded similar near refuge. The necessity of renewing\r\ncoal makes the cruiser of the present day even more dependent than of\r\nold on his port. Public opinion in the United States has great faith\r\nin war directed against an enemy's commerce; but it must be remembered\r\nthat the Republic has no ports very near the great centres of trade\r\nabroad. Her geographical position is therefore singularly\r\ndisadvantageous for carrying on successful commerce-destroying, unless\r\nshe find bases in the ports of an ally.\r\n\r\nIf, in addition to facility for offence, Nature has so placed a\r\ncountry that it has easy access to the high sea itself, while at the\r\nsame time it controls one of the great thoroughfares of the world's\r\ntraffic, it is evident that the strategic value of its position is\r\nvery high. Such again is, and to a greater degree was, the position of\r\nEngland. The trade of Holland, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, and that which\r\nwent up the great rivers to the interior of Germany, had to pass\r\nthrough the Channel close by her doors; for sailing-ships hugged the\r\nEnglish coast. This northern trade had, moreover, a peculiar bearing\r\nupon sea power; for naval stores, as they are commonly called, were\r\nmainly drawn from the Baltic countries.\r\n\r\nBut for the loss of Gibraltar, the position of Spain would have been\r\nclosely analogous to that of England. Looking at once upon the\r\nAtlantic and the Mediterranean, with Cadiz on the one side and\r\nCartagena on the other, the trade to the Levant must have passed under\r\nher hands, and that round the Cape of Good Hope not far from her\r\ndoors. But Gibraltar not only deprived her of the control of the\r\nStraits, it also imposed an obstacle to the easy junction of the two\r\ndivisions of her fleet.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, looking only at the geographical position of\r\nItaly, and not at the other conditions affecting her sea power, it\r\nwould seem that with her extensive sea-coast and good ports she is\r\nvery well placed for exerting a decisive influence on the trade route\r\nto the Levant and by the Isthmus of Suez. This is true in a degree,\r\nand would be much more so did Italy now hold all the islands naturally\r\nItalian; but with Malta in the hands of England, and Corsica in those\r\nof France, the advantages of her geographical position are largely\r\nneutralized. From race affinities and situation those two islands are\r\nas legitimately objects of desire to Italy as Gibraltar is to Spain.\r\nIf the Adriatic were a great highway of commerce, Italy's position\r\nwould be still more influential. These defects in her geographical\r\ncompleteness, combined with other causes injurious to a full and\r\nsecure development of sea power, make it more than doubtful whether\r\nItaly can for some time be in the front rank among the sea nations.\r\n\r\nAs the aim here is not an exhaustive discussion, but merely an\r\nattempt to show, by illustration, how vitally the situation of a\r\ncountry may affect its career upon the sea, this division of the\r\nsubject may be dismissed for the present; the more so as instances\r\nwhich will further bring out its importance will continually recur in\r\nthe historical treatment. Two remarks, however, are here appropriate.\r\n\r\nCircumstances have caused the Mediterranean Sea to play a greater part\r\nin the history of the world, both in a commercial and a military point\r\nof view, than any other sheet of water of the same size. Nation after\r\nnation has striven to control it, and the strife still goes on.\r\nTherefore a study of the conditions upon which preponderance in its\r\nwaters has rested, and now rests, and of the relative military values\r\nof different points upon its coasts, will be more instructive than the\r\nsame amount of effort expended in another field. Furthermore, it has\r\nat the present time a very marked analogy in many respects to the\r\nCaribbean Sea,--an analogy which will be still closer if a Panama\r\ncanal-route ever be completed. A study of the strategic conditions of\r\nthe Mediterranean, which have received ample illustration, will be an\r\nexcellent prelude to a similar study of the Caribbean, which has\r\ncomparatively little history.\r\n\r\nThe second remark bears upon the geographical position of the United\r\nStates relatively to a Central-American canal. If one be made, and\r\nfulfil the hopes of its builders, the Caribbean will be changed from a\r\nterminus, and place of local traffic, or at best a broken and\r\nimperfect line of travel, as it now is, into one of the great highways\r\nof the world. Along this path a great commerce will travel, bringing\r\nthe interests of the other great nations, the European nations, close\r\nalong our shores, as they have never been before. With this it will\r\nnot be so easy as heretofore to stand aloof from international\r\ncomplications. The position of the United States with reference to\r\nthis route will resemble that of England to the Channel, and of the\r\nMediterranean countries to the Suez route. As regards influence and\r\ncontrol over it, depending upon geographical position, it is of course\r\nplain that the centre of the national power, the permanent base,[7]\r\nis much nearer than that of other great nations. The positions now or\r\nhereafter occupied by them on island or mainland, however strong, will\r\nbe but outposts of their power; while in all the raw materials of\r\nmilitary strength no nation is superior to the United States. She is,\r\nhowever, weak in a confessed unpreparedness for war; and her\r\ngeographical nearness to the point of contention loses some of its\r\nvalue by the character of the Gulf coast, which is deficient in ports\r\ncombining security from an enemy with facility for repairing war-ships\r\nof the first class, without which ships no country can pretend to\r\ncontrol any part of the sea. In case of a contest for supremacy in the\r\nCaribbean, it seems evident from the depth of the South Pass of the\r\nMississippi, the nearness of New Orleans, and the advantages of the\r\nMississippi Valley for water transit, that the main effort of the\r\ncountry must pour down that valley, and its permanent base of\r\noperations be found there. The defence of the entrance to the\r\nMississippi, however, presents peculiar difficulties; while the only\r\ntwo rival ports, Key West and Pensacola, have too little depth of\r\nwater, and are much less advantageously placed with reference to the\r\nresources of the country. To get the full benefit of superior\r\ngeographical position, these defects must be overcome. Furthermore, as\r\nher distance from the Isthmus, though relatively less, is still\r\nconsiderable, the United States will have to obtain in the Caribbean\r\nstations fit for contingent, or secondary, bases of operations; which\r\nby their natural advantages, susceptibility of defence, and nearness\r\nto the central strategic issue, will enable her fleets to remain as\r\nnear the scene as any opponent. With ingress and egress from the\r\nMississippi sufficiently protected, with such outposts in her hands,\r\nand with the communications between them and the home base secured, in\r\nshort, with proper military preparation, for which she has all\r\nnecessary means, the preponderance of the United States on this field\r\nfollows, from her geographical position and her power, with\r\nmathematical certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Physical Conformation._--The peculiar features of the Gulf coast,\r\njust alluded to, come properly under the head of Physical Conformation\r\nof a country, which is placed second for discussion among the\r\nconditions which affect the development of sea power.\r\n\r\nThe seaboard of a country is one of its frontiers; and the easier the\r\naccess offered by the frontier to the region beyond, in this case the\r\nsea, the greater will be the tendency of a people toward intercourse\r\nwith the rest of the world by it. If a country be imagined having a\r\nlong seaboard, but entirely without a harbor, such a country can have\r\nno sea trade of its own, no shipping, no navy. This was practically\r\nthe case with Belgium when it was a Spanish and an Austrian province.\r\nThe Dutch, in 1648, as a condition of peace after a successful war,\r\nexacted that the Scheldt should be closed to sea commerce. This closed\r\nthe harbor of Antwerp and transferred the sea trade of Belgium to\r\nHolland. The Spanish Netherlands ceased to be a sea power.\r\n\r\nNumerous and deep harbors are a source of strength and wealth, and\r\ndoubly so if they are the outlets of navigable streams, which\r\nfacilitate the concentration in them of a country's internal trade;\r\nbut by their very accessibility they become a source of weakness in\r\nwar, if not properly defended. The Dutch in 1667 found little\r\ndifficulty in ascending the Thames and burning a large fraction of the\r\nEnglish navy within sight of London; whereas a few years later the\r\ncombined fleets of England and France, when attempting a landing in\r\nHolland, were foiled by the difficulties of the coast as much as by\r\nthe valor of the Dutch fleet. In 1778 the harbor of New York, and with\r\nit undisputed control of the Hudson River, would have been lost to the\r\nEnglish, who were caught at disadvantage, but for the hesitancy of the\r\nFrench admiral. With that control, New England would have been\r\nrestored to close and safe communication with New York, New Jersey,\r\nand Pennsylvania; and this blow, following so closely on Burgoyne's\r\ndisaster of the year before, would probably have led the English to\r\nmake an earlier peace. The Mississippi is a mighty source of wealth\r\nand strength to the United States; but the feeble defences of its\r\nmouth and the number of its subsidiary streams penetrating the country\r\nmade it a weakness and source of disaster to the Southern Confederacy.\r\nAnd lastly, in 1814, the occupation of the Chesapeake and the\r\ndestruction of Washington gave a sharp lesson of the dangers incurred\r\nthrough the noblest water-ways, if their approaches be undefended; a\r\nlesson recent enough to be easily recalled, but which, from the\r\npresent appearance of the coast defences, seems to be yet more easily\r\nforgotten. Nor should it be thought that conditions have changed;\r\ncircumstances and details of offence and defence have been modified,\r\nin these days as before, but the great conditions remain the same.\r\n\r\nBefore and during the great Napoleonic wars, France had no port for\r\nships-of-the-line east of Brest. How great the advantage to England,\r\nwhich in the same stretch has two great arsenals, at Plymouth and at\r\nPortsmouth, besides other harbors of refuge and supply. This defect of\r\nconformation has since been remedied by the works at Cherbourg.\r\n\r\nBesides the contour of the coast, involving easy access to the sea,\r\nthere are other physical conditions which lead people to the sea or\r\nturn them from it. Although France was deficient in military ports on\r\nthe Channel, she had both there and on the ocean, as well as in the\r\nMediterranean, excellent harbors, favorably situated for trade abroad,\r\nand at the outlet of large rivers, which would foster internal\r\ntraffic. But when Richelieu had put an end to civil war, Frenchmen did\r\nnot take to the sea with the eagerness and success of the English and\r\nDutch. A principal reason for this has been plausibly found in the\r\nphysical conditions which have made France a pleasant land, with a\r\ndelightful climate, producing within itself more than its people\r\nneeded. England, on the other hand, received from Nature but little,\r\nand, until her manufactures were developed, had little to export.\r\nTheir many wants, combined with their restless activity and other\r\nconditions that favored maritime enterprise, led her people abroad;\r\nand they there found lands more pleasant and richer than their own.\r\nTheir needs and genius made them merchants and colonists, then\r\nmanufacturers and producers; and between products and colonies\r\nshipping is the inevitable link. So their sea power grew. But if\r\nEngland was drawn to the sea, Holland was driven to it; without the\r\nsea England languished, but Holland died. In the height of her\r\ngreatness, when she was one of the chief factors in European politics,\r\na competent native authority estimated that the soil of Holland could\r\nnot support more than one eighth of her inhabitants. The manufactures\r\nof the country were then numerous and important, but they had been\r\nmuch later in their growth than the shipping interest. The poverty of\r\nthe soil and the exposed nature of the coast drove the Dutch first to\r\nfishing. Then the discovery of the process of curing the fish gave\r\nthem material for export as well as home consumption, and so laid the\r\ncorner-stone of their wealth. Thus they had become traders at the time\r\nthat the Italian republics, under the pressure of Turkish power and\r\nthe discovery of the passage round the Cape of Good Hope, were\r\nbeginning to decline, and they fell heirs to the great Italian trade\r\nof the Levant. Further favored by their geographical position,\r\nintermediate between the Baltic, France, and the Mediterranean, and at\r\nthe mouth of the German rivers, they quickly absorbed nearly all the\r\ncarrying-trade of Europe. The wheat and naval stores of the Baltic,\r\nthe trade of Spain with her colonies in the New World, the wines of\r\nFrance, and the French coasting-trade were, little more than two\r\nhundred years ago, transported in Dutch shipping. Much of the\r\ncarrying-trade of England, even, was then done in Dutch bottoms. It\r\nwill not be pretended that all this prosperity proceeded only from the\r\npoverty of Holland's natural resources. Something does not grow from\r\nnothing. What is true, is, that by the necessitous condition of her\r\npeople they were driven to the sea, and were, from their mastery of\r\nthe shipping business and the size of their fleets, in a position to\r\nprofit by the sudden expansion of commerce and the spirit of\r\nexploration which followed on the discovery of America and of the\r\npassage round the Cape. Other causes concurred, but their whole\r\nprosperity stood on the sea power to which their poverty gave birth.\r\nTheir food, their clothing, the raw material for their manufactures,\r\nthe very timber and hemp with which they built and rigged their ships\r\n(and they built nearly as many as all Europe besides), were imported;\r\nand when a disastrous war with England in 1653 and 1654 had lasted\r\neighteen months, and their shipping business was stopped, it is said\r\n\"the sources of revenue which had always maintained the riches of the\r\nState, such as fisheries and commerce, were almost dry. Workshops were\r\nclosed, work was suspended. The Zuyder Zee became a forest of masts;\r\nthe country was full of beggars; grass grew in the streets, and in\r\nAmsterdam fifteen hundred houses were untenanted.\" A humiliating peace\r\nalone saved them from ruin.\r\n\r\nThis sorrowful result shows the weakness of a country depending wholly\r\nupon sources external to itself for the part it is playing in the\r\nworld. With large deductions, owing to differences of conditions which\r\nneed not here be spoken of, the case of Holland then has strong points\r\nof resemblance to that of Great Britain now; and they are true\r\nprophets, though they seem to be having small honor in their own\r\ncountry, who warn her that the continuance of her prosperity at home\r\ndepends primarily upon maintaining her power abroad. Men may be\r\ndiscontented at the lack of political privilege; they will be yet more\r\nuneasy if they come to lack bread. It is of more interest to Americans\r\nto note that the result to France, regarded as a power of the sea,\r\ncaused by the extent, delightfulness, and richness of the land, has\r\nbeen reproduced in the United States. In the beginning, their\r\nforefathers held a narrow strip of land upon the sea, fertile in parts\r\nthough little developed, abounding in harbors and near rich\r\nfishing-grounds. These physical conditions combined with an inborn\r\nlove of the sea, the pulse of that English blood which still beat in\r\ntheir veins, to keep alive all those tendencies and pursuits upon\r\nwhich a healthy sea power depends. Almost every one of the original\r\ncolonies was on the sea or on one of its great tributaries. All export\r\nand import tended toward one coast. Interest in the sea and an\r\nintelligent appreciation of the part it played in the public welfare\r\nwere easily and widely spread; and a motive more influential than care\r\nfor the public interest was also active, for the abundance of\r\nship-building materials and a relative fewness of other investments\r\nmade shipping a profitable private interest. How changed the present\r\ncondition is, all know. The centre of power is no longer on the\r\nseaboard. Books and newspapers vie with one another in describing the\r\nwonderful growth, and the still undeveloped riches, of the interior.\r\nCapital there finds its best investments, labor its largest\r\nopportunities. The frontiers are neglected and politically weak; the\r\nGulf and Pacific coasts actually so, the Atlantic coast relatively to\r\nthe central Mississippi Valley. When the day comes that shipping again\r\npays, when the three sea frontiers find that they are not only\r\nmilitarily weak, but poorer for lack of national shipping, their\r\nunited efforts may avail to lay again the foundations of our sea\r\npower. Till then, those who follow the limitations which lack of sea\r\npower placed upon the career of France may mourn that their own\r\ncountry is being led, by a like redundancy of home wealth, into the\r\nsame neglect of that great instrument.\r\n\r\nAmong modifying physical conditions may be noted a form like that of\r\nItaly,--a long peninsula, with a central range of mountains dividing\r\nit into two narrow strips, along which the roads connecting the\r\ndifferent ports necessarily run. Only an absolute control of the sea\r\ncan wholly secure such communications, since it is impossible to know\r\nat what point an enemy coming from beyond the visible horizon may\r\nstrike; but still, with an adequate naval force centrally posted,\r\nthere will be good hope of attacking his fleet, which is at once his\r\nbase and line of communications, before serious damage has been done.\r\nThe long, narrow peninsula of Florida, with Key West at its\r\nextremity, though flat and thinly populated, presents at first sight\r\nconditions like those of Italy. The resemblance may be only\r\nsuperficial, but it seems probable that if the chief scene of a naval\r\nwar were the Gulf of Mexico, the communications by land to the end of\r\nthe peninsula might be a matter of consequence, and open to attack.\r\n\r\nWhen the sea not only borders, or surrounds, but also separates a\r\ncountry into two or more parts, the control of it becomes not only\r\ndesirable, but vitally necessary. Such a physical condition either\r\ngives birth and strength to sea power, or makes the country powerless.\r\nSuch is the condition of the present kingdom of Italy, with its\r\nislands of Sardinia and Sicily; and hence in its youth and still\r\nexisting financial weakness it is seen to put forth such vigorous and\r\nintelligent efforts to create a military navy. It has even been argued\r\nthat, with a navy decidedly superior to her enemy's, Italy could\r\nbetter base her power upon her islands than upon her mainland; for the\r\ninsecurity of the lines of communication in the peninsula, already\r\npointed out, would most seriously embarrass an invading army\r\nsurrounded by a hostile people and threatened from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Sea, separating the British Islands, rather resembles an\r\nestuary than an actual division; but history has shown the danger\r\nfrom it to the United Kingdom. In the days of Louis XIV., when the\r\nFrench navy nearly equalled the combined English and Dutch, the\r\ngravest complications existed in Ireland, which passed almost wholly\r\nunder the control of the natives and the French. Nevertheless, the\r\nIrish Sea was rather a danger to the English--a weak point in their\r\ncommunications--than an advantage to the French. The latter did not\r\nventure their ships-of-the-line in its narrow waters, and expeditions\r\nintending to land were directed upon the ocean ports in the south and\r\nwest. At the supreme moment the great French fleet was sent upon the\r\nsouth coast of England, where it decisively defeated the allies, and\r\nat the same time twenty-five frigates were sent to St. George's\r\nChannel, against the English communications. In the midst of a\r\nhostile people, the English army in Ireland was seriously imperilled,\r\nbut was saved by the battle of the Boyne and the flight of James II.\r\nThis movement against the enemy's communications was strictly\r\nstrategic, and would be just as dangerous to England now as in 1690.\r\n\r\nSpain, in the same century, afforded an impressive lesson of the\r\nweakness caused by such separation when the parts are not knit\r\ntogether by a strong sea power. She then still retained, as remnants\r\nof her past greatness, the Netherlands (now Belgium), Sicily, and\r\nother Italian possessions, not to speak of her vast colonies in the\r\nNew World. Yet so low had the Spanish sea power fallen, that a\r\nwell-informed and sober-minded Hollander of the day could claim that\r\n\"in Spain all the coast is navigated by a few Dutch ships; and since\r\nthe peace of 1648 their ships and seamen are so few that they have\r\npublicly begun to hire our ships to sail to the Indies, whereas they\r\nwere formerly careful to exclude all foreigners from there.... It is\r\nmanifest,\" he goes on, \"that the West Indies, being as the stomach to\r\nSpain (for from it nearly all the revenue is drawn), must be joined to\r\nthe Spanish head by a sea force; and that Naples and the Netherlands,\r\nbeing like two arms, they cannot lay out their strength for Spain, nor\r\nreceive anything thence but by shipping,--all which may easily be done\r\nby our shipping in peace, and by it obstructed in war.\" Half a century\r\nbefore, Sully, the great minister of Henry IV., had characterized\r\nSpain \"as one of those States whose legs and arms are strong and\r\npowerful, but the heart infinitely weak and feeble.\" Since his day the\r\nSpanish navy had suffered not only disaster, but annihilation; not\r\nonly humiliation, but degradation. The consequences briefly were that\r\nshipping was destroyed; manufactures perished with it. The government\r\ndepended for its support, not upon a wide-spread healthy commerce and\r\nindustry that could survive many a staggering blow, but upon a narrow\r\nstream of silver trickling through a few treasure-ships from America,\r\neasily and frequently intercepted by an enemy's cruisers. The loss of\r\nhalf a dozen galleons more than once paralyzed its movements for a\r\nyear. While the war in the Netherlands lasted, the Dutch control of\r\nthe sea forced Spain to send her troops by a long and costly journey\r\noverland instead of by sea; and the same cause reduced her to such\r\nstraits for necessaries that, by a mutual arrangement which seems very\r\nodd to modern ideas, her wants were supplied by Dutch ships, which\r\nthus maintained the enemies of their country, but received in return\r\nspecie which was welcome in the Amsterdam exchange. In America, the\r\nSpanish protected themselves as best they might behind masonry,\r\nunaided from home; while in the Mediterranean they escaped insult and\r\ninjury mainly through the indifference of the Dutch, for the French\r\nand English had not yet begun to contend for mastery there. In the\r\ncourse of history the Netherlands, Naples, Sicily, Minorca, Havana,\r\nManila, and Jamaica were wrenched away, at one time or another, from\r\nthis empire without a shipping. In short, while Spain's maritime\r\nimpotence may have been primarily a symptom of her general decay, it\r\nbecame a marked factor in precipitating her into the abyss from which\r\nshe has not yet wholly emerged.\r\n\r\nExcept Alaska, the United States has no outlying possession,--no foot\r\nof ground inaccessible by land. Its contour is such as to present few\r\npoints specially weak from their saliency, and all important parts of\r\nthe frontiers can be readily attained,--cheaply by water, rapidly by\r\nrail. The weakest frontier, the Pacific, is far removed from the most\r\ndangerous of possible enemies. The internal resources are boundless as\r\ncompared with present needs; we can live off ourselves indefinitely in\r\n\"our little corner,\" to use the expression of a French officer to the\r\nauthor. Yet should that little corner be invaded by a new commercial\r\nroute through the Isthmus, the United States in her turn may have the\r\nrude awakening of those who have abandoned their share in the common\r\nbirthright of all people, the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Extent of Territory._--The last of the conditions affecting the\r\ndevelopment of a nation as a sea power, and touching the country\r\nitself as distinguished from the people who dwell there, is Extent of\r\nTerritory. This may be dismissed with comparatively few words.\r\n\r\nAs regards the development of sea power, it is not the total number of\r\nsquare miles which a country contains, but the length of its\r\ncoast-line and the character of its harbors that are to be considered.\r\nAs to these it is to be said that, the geographical and physical\r\nconditions being the same, extent of sea-coast is a source of strength\r\nor weakness according as the population is large or small. A country\r\nis in this like a fortress; the garrison must be proportioned to the\r\n_enceinte_. A recent familiar instance is found in the American War of\r\nSecession. Had the South had a people as numerous as it was warlike,\r\nand a navy commensurate to its other resources as a sea power, the\r\ngreat extent of its sea-coast and its numerous inlets would have been\r\nelements of great strength. The people of the United States and the\r\nGovernment of that day justly prided themselves on the effectiveness\r\nof the blockade of the whole Southern coast. It was a great feat, a\r\nvery great feat; but it would have been an impossible feat had the\r\nSoutherners been more numerous, and a nation of seamen. What was there\r\nshown was not, as has been said, how such a blockade can be\r\nmaintained, but that such a blockade is possible in the face of a\r\npopulation not only unused to the sea, but also scanty in numbers.\r\nThose who recall how the blockade was maintained, and the class of\r\nships that blockaded during great part of the war, know that the plan,\r\ncorrect under the circumstances, could not have been carried out in\r\nthe face of a real navy. Scattered unsupported along the coast, the\r\nUnited States ships kept their places, singly or in small detachments,\r\nin face of an extensive network of inland water communications which\r\nfavored secret concentration of the enemy. Behind the first line of\r\nwater communications were long estuaries, and here and there strong\r\nfortresses, upon either of which the enemy's ships could always fall\r\nback to elude pursuit or to receive protection. Had there been a\r\nSouthern navy to profit by such advantages, or by the scattered\r\ncondition of the United States ships, the latter could not have been\r\ndistributed as they were; and being forced to concentrate for mutual\r\nsupport, many small but useful approaches would have been left open to\r\ncommerce. But as the Southern coast, from its extent and many inlets,\r\nmight have been a source of strength, so, from those very\r\ncharacteristics, it became a fruitful source of injury. The great\r\nstory of the opening of the Mississippi is but the most striking\r\nillustration of an action that was going on incessantly all over the\r\nSouth. At every breach of the sea frontier, war-ships were entering.\r\nThe streams that had carried the wealth and supported the trade of the\r\nseceding States turned against them, and admitted their enemies to\r\ntheir hearts. Dismay, insecurity, paralysis, prevailed in regions that\r\nmight, under happier auspices, have kept a nation alive through the\r\nmost exhausting war. Never did sea power play a greater or a more\r\ndecisive part than in the contest which determined that the course of\r\nthe world's history would be modified by the existence of one great\r\nnation, instead of several rival States, in the North American\r\ncontinent. But while just pride is felt in the well-earned glory of\r\nthose days, and the greatness of the results due to naval\r\npreponderance is admitted, Americans who understand the facts should\r\nnever fail to remind the over-confidence of their countrymen that the\r\nSouth not only had no navy, not only was not a seafaring people, but\r\nthat also its population was not proportioned to the extent of the\r\nsea-coast which it had to defend.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Number of Population._--After the consideration of the natural\r\nconditions of a country should follow an examination of the\r\ncharacteristics of its population as affecting the development of sea\r\npower; and first among these will be taken, because of its relations\r\nto the extent of the territory, which has just been discussed, the\r\nnumber of the people who live in it. It has been said that in respect\r\nof dimensions it is not merely the number of square miles, but the\r\nextent and character of the sea-coast that is to be considered with\r\nreference to sea power; and so, in point of population, it is not only\r\nthe grand total, but the number following the sea, or at least readily\r\navailable for employment on ship-board and for the creation of naval\r\nmaterial, that must be counted.\r\n\r\nFor example, formerly and up to the end of the great wars following\r\nthe French Revolution, the population of France was much greater than\r\nthat of England; but in respect of sea power in general, peaceful\r\ncommerce as well as military efficiency, France was much inferior to\r\nEngland. In the matter of military efficiency this fact is the more\r\nremarkable because at times, in point of military preparation at the\r\noutbreak of war, France had the advantage; but she was not able to\r\nkeep it. Thus in 1778, when war broke out, France, through her\r\nmaritime inscription, was able to man at once fifty ships-of-the-line.\r\nEngland, on the contrary, by reason of the dispersal over the globe of\r\nthat very shipping on which her naval strength so securely rested, had\r\nmuch trouble in manning forty at home; but in 1782 she had one hundred\r\nand twenty in commission or ready for commission, while France had\r\nnever been able to exceed seventy-one. Again, as late as 1840, when\r\nthe two nations were on the verge of war in the Levant, a most\r\naccomplished French officer of the day, while extolling the high state\r\nof efficiency of the French fleet and the eminent qualities of its\r\nadmiral, and expressing confidence in the results of an encounter with\r\nan equal enemy, goes on to say: \"Behind the squadron of twenty-one\r\nships-of-the-line which we could then assemble, there was no reserve;\r\nnot another ship could have been commissioned within six months.\" And\r\nthis was due not only to lack of ships and of proper equipments,\r\nthough both were wanting. \"Our maritime inscription,\" he continues,\r\n\"was so exhausted by what we had done [in manning twenty-one ships],\r\nthat the permanent levy established in all quarters did not supply\r\nreliefs for the men, who were already more than three years on\r\ncruise.\"\r\n\r\nA contrast such as this shows a difference in what is called staying\r\npower, or reserve force, which is even greater than appears on the\r\nsurface; for a great shipping afloat necessarily employs, besides the\r\ncrews, a large number of people engaged in the various handicrafts\r\nwhich facilitate the making and repairing of naval material, or\r\nfollowing other callings more or less closely connected with the water\r\nand with craft of all kinds. Such kindred callings give an undoubted\r\naptitude for the sea from the outset. There is an anecdote showing\r\ncurious insight into this matter on the part of one of England's\r\ndistinguished seamen, Sir Edward Pellew. When the war broke out in\r\n1793, the usual scarceness of seamen was met. Eager to get to sea and\r\nunable to fill his complement otherwise than with landsmen, he\r\ninstructed his officers to seek for Cornish miners; reasoning from the\r\nconditions and dangers of their calling, of which he had personal\r\nknowledge, that they would quickly fit into the demands of sea life.\r\nThe result showed his sagacity, for, thus escaping an otherwise\r\nunavoidable delay, he was fortunate enough to capture the first\r\nfrigate taken in the war in single combat; and what is especially\r\ninstructive is, that although but a few weeks in commission, while his\r\nopponent had been over a year, the losses, heavy on both sides, were\r\nnearly equal.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that such reserve strength has now nearly lost the\r\nimportance it once had, because modern ships and weapons take so long\r\nto make, and because modern States aim at developing the whole power\r\nof their armed force, on the outbreak of war, with such rapidity as to\r\nstrike a disabling blow before the enemy can organize an equal effort.\r\nTo use a familiar phrase, there will not be time for the whole\r\nresistance of the national fabric to come into play; the blow will\r\nfall on the organized military fleet, and if that yield, the solidity\r\nof the rest of the structure will avail nothing. To a certain extent\r\nthis is true; but then it has always been true, though to a less\r\nextent formerly than now. Granted the meeting of two fleets which\r\nrepresent practically the whole present strength of their two nations,\r\nif one of them be destroyed, while the other remains fit for action,\r\nthere will be much less hope now than formerly that the vanquished\r\ncan restore his navy for that war; and the result will be disastrous\r\njust in proportion to the dependence of the nation upon her sea power.\r\nA Trafalgar would have been a much more fatal blow to England than it\r\nwas to France, had the English fleet then represented, as the allied\r\nfleet did, the bulk of the nation's power. Trafalgar in such a case\r\nwould have been to England what Austerlitz was to Austria, and Jena to\r\nPrussia; an empire would have been laid prostrate by the destruction\r\nor disorganization of its military forces, which, it is said, were the\r\nfavorite objective of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nBut does the consideration of such exceptional disasters in the past\r\njustify the putting a low value upon that reserve strength, based upon\r\nthe number of inhabitants fitted for a certain kind of military life,\r\nwhich is here being considered? The blows just mentioned were dealt by\r\nmen of exceptional genius, at the head of armed bodies of exceptional\r\ntraining, _esprit-de-corps_, and prestige, and were, besides,\r\ninflicted upon opponents more or less demoralized by conscious\r\ninferiority and previous defeat. Austerlitz had been closely preceded\r\nby Ulm, where thirty thousand Austrians laid down their arms without a\r\nbattle; and the history of the previous years had been one long record\r\nof Austrian reverse and French success. Trafalgar followed closely\r\nupon a cruise, justly called a campaign, of almost constant failure;\r\nand farther back, but still recent, were the memories of St. Vincent\r\nfor the Spaniards, and of the Nile for the French, in the allied\r\nfleet. Except the case of Jena, these crushing overthrows were not\r\nsingle disasters, but final blows; and in the Jena campaign there was\r\na disparity in numbers, equipment, and general preparation for war,\r\nwhich makes it less applicable in considering what may result from a\r\nsingle victory.\r\n\r\nEngland is at the present time the greatest maritime nation in the\r\nworld; in steam and iron she has kept the superiority she had in the\r\ndays of sail and wood. France and England are the two powers that have\r\nthe largest military navies; and it is so far an open question which\r\nof the two is the more powerful, that they may be regarded as\r\npractically of equal strength in material for a sea war. In the case\r\nof a collision can there be assumed such a difference of _personnel_,\r\nor of preparation, as to make it probable that a decisive inequality\r\nwill result from one battle or one campaign? If not, the reserve\r\nstrength will begin to tell; organized reserve first, then reserve of\r\nseafaring population, reserve of mechanical skill, reserve of wealth.\r\nIt seems to have been somewhat forgotten that England's leadership in\r\nmechanical arts gives her a reserve of mechanics, who can easily\r\nfamiliarize themselves with the appliances of modern iron-clads; and\r\nas her commerce and industries feel the burden of the war, the surplus\r\nof seamen and mechanics will go to the armed shipping.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of the value of a reserve, developed or\r\nundeveloped, amounts now to this: Have modern conditions of warfare\r\nmade it probable that, of two nearly equal adversaries, one will be so\r\nprostrated in a single campaign that a decisive result will be reached\r\nin that time? Sea warfare has given no answer. The crushing successes\r\nof Prussia against Austria, and of Germany against France, appear to\r\nhave been those of a stronger over a much weaker nation, whether the\r\nweakness were due to natural causes, or to official incompetency. How\r\nwould a delay like that of Plevna have affected the fortune of war,\r\nhad Turkey had any reserve of national power upon which to call?\r\n\r\nIf time be, as is everywhere admitted, a supreme factor in war, it\r\nbehooves countries whose genius is essentially not military, whose\r\npeople, like all free people, object to pay for large military\r\nestablishments, to see to it that they are at least strong enough to\r\ngain the time necessary to turn the spirit and capacity of their\r\nsubjects into the new activities which war calls for. If the existing\r\nforce by land or sea is strong enough so to hold out, even though at a\r\ndisadvantage, the country may rely upon its natural resources and\r\nstrength coming into play for whatever they are worth,--its numbers,\r\nits wealth, its capacities of every kind. If, on the other hand, what\r\nforce it has can be overthrown and crushed quickly, the most\r\nmagnificent possibilities of natural power will not save it from\r\nhumiliating conditions, nor, if its foe be wise, from guarantees which\r\nwill postpone revenge to a distant future. The story is constantly\r\nrepeated on the smaller fields of war: \"If so-and-so can hold out a\r\nlittle longer, this can be saved or that can be done;\" as in sickness\r\nit is often said: \"If the patient can only hold out so long, the\r\nstrength of his constitution may pull him through.\"\r\n\r\nEngland to some extent is now such a country. Holland was such a\r\ncountry; she would not pay, and if she escaped, it was but by the skin\r\nof her teeth. \"Never in time of peace and from fear of a rupture,\"\r\nwrote their great statesman, De Witt, \"will they take resolutions\r\nstrong enough to lead them to pecuniary sacrifices beforehand. The\r\ncharacter of the Dutch is such that, unless danger stares them in the\r\nface, they are indisposed to lay out money for their own defence. I\r\nhave to do with a people who, liberal to profusion where they ought to\r\neconomize, are often sparing to avarice where they ought to spend.\"\r\n\r\nThat our own country is open to the same reproach, is patent to all\r\nthe world. The United States has not that shield of defensive power\r\nbehind which time can be gained to develop its reserve of strength. As\r\nfor a seafaring population adequate to her possible needs, where is\r\nit? Such a resource, proportionate to her coast-line and population,\r\nis to be found only in a national merchant shipping and its related\r\nindustries, which at present scarcely exist. It will matter little\r\nwhether the crews of such ships are native or foreign born, provided\r\nthey are attached to the flag, and her power at sea is sufficient to\r\nenable the most of them to get back in case of war. When foreigners by\r\nthousands are admitted to the ballot, it is of little moment that they\r\nare given fighting-room on board ship.\r\n\r\nThough the treatment of the subject has been somewhat discursive, it\r\nmay be admitted that a great population following callings related to\r\nthe sea is, now as formerly, a great element of sea power; that the\r\nUnited States is deficient in that element; and that its foundations\r\ncan be laid only in a large commerce under her own flag.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _National Character._--The effect of national character and\r\naptitudes upon the development of sea power will next be considered.\r\n\r\nIf sea power be really based upon a peaceful and extensive commerce,\r\naptitude for commercial pursuits must be a distinguishing feature of\r\nthe nations that have at one time or another been great upon the sea.\r\nHistory almost without exception affirms that this is true. Save the\r\nRomans, there is no marked instance to the contrary.\r\n\r\nAll men seek gain and, more or less, love money; but the way in which\r\ngain is sought will have a marked effect upon the commercial fortunes\r\nand the history of the people inhabiting a country.\r\n\r\nIf history may be believed, the way in which the Spaniards and their\r\nkindred nation, the Portuguese, sought wealth, not only brought a blot\r\nupon the national character, but was also fatal to the growth of a\r\nhealthy commerce; and so to the industries upon which commerce lives,\r\nand ultimately to that national wealth which was sought by mistaken\r\npaths. The desire for gain rose in them to fierce avarice; so they\r\nsought in the new-found worlds which gave such an impetus to the\r\ncommercial and maritime development of the countries of Europe, not\r\nnew fields of industry, not even the healthy excitement of exploration\r\nand adventure, but gold and silver. They had many great qualities;\r\nthey were bold, enterprising, temperate, patient of suffering,\r\nenthusiastic, and gifted with intense national feeling. When to these\r\nqualities are added the advantages of Spain's position and\r\nwell-situated ports, the fact that she was first to occupy large and\r\nrich portions of the new worlds and long remained without a\r\ncompetitor, and that for a hundred years after the discovery of\r\nAmerica she was the leading State in Europe, she might have been\r\nexpected to take the foremost place among the sea powers. Exactly the\r\ncontrary was the result, as all know. Since the battle of Lepanto in\r\n1571, though engaged in many wars, no sea victory of any consequence\r\nshines on the pages of Spanish history; and the decay of her commerce\r\nsufficiently accounts for the painful and sometimes ludicrous\r\ninaptness shown on the decks of her ships of war. Doubtless such a\r\nresult is not to be attributed to one cause only. Doubtless the\r\ngovernment of Spain was in many ways such as to cramp and blight a\r\nfree and healthy development of private enterprise; but the character\r\nof a great people breaks through or shapes the character of its\r\ngovernment, and it can hardly be doubted that had the bent of the\r\npeople been toward trade, the action of government would have been\r\ndrawn into the same current. The great field of the colonies, also,\r\nwas remote from the centre of that despotism which blighted the growth\r\nof old Spain. As it was, thousands of Spaniards, of the working as\r\nwell as the upper classes, left Spain; and the occupations in which\r\nthey engaged abroad sent home little but specie, or merchandise of\r\nsmall bulk, requiring but small tonnage. The mother-country herself\r\nproduced little but wool, fruit, and iron; her manufactures were\r\nnaught; her industries suffered; her population steadily decreased.\r\nBoth she and her colonies depended upon the Dutch for so many of the\r\nnecessaries of life, that the products of their scanty industries\r\ncould not suffice to pay for them. \"So that Holland merchants,\" writes\r\na contemporary, \"who carry money to most parts of the world to buy\r\ncommodities, must out of this single country of Europe carry home\r\nmoney, which they receive in payment of their goods.\" Thus their\r\neagerly sought emblem of wealth passed quickly from their hands. It\r\nhas already been pointed out how weak, from a military point of view,\r\nSpain was from this decay of her shipping. Her wealth being in small\r\nbulk on a few ships, following more or less regular routes, was easily\r\nseized by an enemy, and the sinews of war paralyzed; whereas the\r\nwealth of England and Holland, scattered over thousands of ships in\r\nall parts of the world, received many bitter blows in many exhausting\r\nwars, without checking a growth which, though painful, was steady. The\r\nfortunes of Portugal, united to Spain during a most critical period of\r\nher history, followed the same downward path: although foremost in\r\nthe beginning of the race for development by sea, she fell utterly\r\nbehind. \"The mines of Brazil were the ruin of Portugal, as those of\r\nMexico and Peru had been of Spain; all manufactures fell into insane\r\ncontempt; ere long the English supplied the Portuguese not only with\r\nclothes, but with all merchandise, all commodities, even to salt-fish\r\nand grain. After their gold, the Portuguese abandoned their very soil;\r\nthe vineyards of Oporto were finally bought by the English with\r\nBrazilian gold, which had only passed through Portugal to be spread\r\nthroughout England.\" We are assured that in fifty years, five hundred\r\nmillions of dollars were extracted from \"the mines of Brazil, and that\r\nat the end of the time Portugal had but twenty-five millions in\r\nspecie,\"--a striking example of the difference between real and\r\nfictitious wealth.\r\n\r\nThe English and Dutch were no less desirous of gain than the southern\r\nnations. Each in turn has been called \"a nation of shopkeepers;\" but\r\nthe jeer, in so far as it is just, is to the credit of their wisdom\r\nand uprightness. They were no less bold, no less enterprising, no less\r\npatient. Indeed, they were more patient, in that they sought riches\r\nnot by the sword but by labor, which is the reproach meant to be\r\nimplied by the epithet; for thus they took the longest, instead of\r\nwhat seemed the shortest, road to wealth. But these two peoples,\r\nradically of the same race, had other qualities, no less important\r\nthan those just named, which combined with their surroundings to favor\r\ntheir development by sea. They were by nature business-men, traders,\r\nproducers, negotiators. Therefore both in their native country and\r\nabroad, whether settled in the ports of civilized nations, or of\r\nbarbarous eastern rulers, or in colonies of their own foundation, they\r\neverywhere strove to draw out all the resources of the land, to\r\ndevelop and increase them. The quick instinct of the born trader,\r\nshopkeeper if you will, sought continually new articles to exchange;\r\nand this search, combined with the industrious character evolved\r\nthrough generations of labor, made them necessarily producers. At home\r\nthey became great as manufacturers; abroad, where they controlled, the\r\nland grew richer continually, products multiplied, and the necessary\r\nexchange between home and the settlements called for more ships. Their\r\nshipping therefore increased with these demands of trade, and nations\r\nwith less aptitude for maritime enterprise, even France herself, great\r\nas she has been, called for their products and for the service of\r\ntheir ships. Thus in many ways they advanced to power at sea. This\r\nnatural tendency and growth were indeed modified and seriously checked\r\nat times by the interference of other governments, jealous of a\r\nprosperity which their own people could invade only by the aid of\r\nartificial support,--a support which will be considered under the head\r\nof governmental action as affecting sea power.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to trade, involving of necessity the production of\r\nsomething to trade with, is the national characteristic most important\r\nto the development of sea power. Granting it and a good seaboard, it\r\nis not likely that the dangers of the sea, or any aversion to it, will\r\ndeter a people from seeking wealth by the paths of ocean commerce.\r\nWhere wealth is sought by other means, it may be found; but it will\r\nnot necessarily lead to sea power. Take France. France has a fine\r\ncountry, an industrious people, an admirable position. The French navy\r\nhas known periods of great glory, and in its lowest estate has never\r\ndishonored the military reputation so dear to the nation. Yet as a\r\nmaritime State, securely resting upon a broad basis of sea commerce,\r\nFrance, as compared with other historical sea-peoples, has never held\r\nmore than a respectable position. The chief reason for this, so far as\r\nnational character goes, is the way in which wealth is sought. As\r\nSpain and Portugal sought it by digging gold out of the ground, the\r\ntemper of the French people leads them to seek it by thrift, economy,\r\nhoarding. It is said to be harder to keep than to make a fortune.\r\nPossibly; but the adventurous temper, which risks what it has to gain\r\nmore, has much in common with the adventurous spirit that conquers\r\nworlds for commerce. The tendency to save and put aside, to venture\r\ntimidly and on a small scale, may lead to a general diffusion of\r\nwealth on a like small scale, but not to the risks and development of\r\nexternal trade and shipping interests. To illustrate,--and the\r\nincident is given only for what it is worth,--a French officer,\r\nspeaking to the author about the Panama Canal, said: \"I have two\r\nshares in it. In France we don't do as you, where a few people take a\r\ngreat many shares each. With us a large number of people take one\r\nshare or a very few. When these were in the market my wife said to me,\r\n'You take two shares, one for you and one for me.'\" As regards the\r\nstability of a man's personal fortunes this kind of prudence is\r\ndoubtless wise; but when excessive prudence or financial timidity\r\nbecomes a national trait, it must tend to hamper the expansion of\r\ncommerce and of the nation's shipping. The same caution in money\r\nmatters, appearing in another relation of life, has checked the\r\nproduction of children, and keeps the population of France nearly\r\nstationary.\r\n\r\nThe noble classes of Europe inherited from the Middle Ages a\r\nsupercilious contempt for peaceful trade, which has exercised a\r\nmodifying influence upon its growth, according to the national\r\ncharacter of different countries. The pride of the Spaniards fell\r\neasily in with this spirit of contempt, and co-operated with that\r\ndisastrous unwillingness to work and wait for wealth which turned them\r\naway from commerce. In France, the vanity which is conceded even by\r\nFrenchmen to be a national trait led in the same direction. The\r\nnumbers and brilliancy of the nobility, and the consideration enjoyed\r\nby them, set a seal of inferiority upon an occupation which they\r\ndespised. Rich merchants and manufacturers sighed for the honors of\r\nnobility, and upon obtaining them, abandoned their lucrative\r\nprofessions. Therefore, while the industry of the people and the\r\nfruitfulness of the soil saved commerce from total decay, it was\r\npursued under a sense of humiliation which caused its best\r\nrepresentatives to escape from it as soon as they could. Louis XIV.,\r\nunder the influence of Colbert, put forth an ordinance \"authorizing\r\nall noblemen to take an interest in merchant ships, goods and\r\nmerchandise, without being considered as having derogated from\r\nnobility, provided they did not sell at retail;\" and the reason given\r\nfor this action was, \"that it imports the good of our subjects and our\r\nown satisfaction, to efface the relic of a public opinion, universally\r\nprevalent, that maritime commerce is incompatible with nobility.\" But\r\na prejudice involving conscious and open superiority is not readily\r\neffaced by ordinances, especially when vanity is a conspicuous trait\r\nin national character; and many years later Montesquieu taught that it\r\nis contrary to the spirit of monarchy that the nobility should engage\r\nin trade.\r\n\r\nIn Holland there was a nobility; but the State was republican in name,\r\nallowed large scope to personal freedom and enterprise, and the\r\ncentres of power were in the great cities. The foundation of the\r\nnational greatness was money--or rather wealth. Wealth, as a source of\r\ncivic distinction, carried with it also power in the State; and with\r\npower there went social position and consideration. In England the\r\nsame result obtained. The nobility were proud; but in a representative\r\ngovernment the power of wealth could be neither put down nor\r\novershadowed. It was patent to the eyes of all; it was honored by all;\r\nand in England, as well as Holland, the occupations which were the\r\nsource of wealth shared in the honor given to wealth itself. Thus, in\r\nall the countries named, social sentiment, the outcome of national\r\ncharacteristics, had a marked influence upon the national attitude\r\ntoward trade.\r\n\r\nIn yet another way does the national genius affect the growth of sea\r\npower in its broadest sense; and that is in so far as it possesses the\r\ncapacity for planting healthy colonies. Of colonization, as of all\r\nother growths, it is true that it is most healthy when it is most\r\nnatural. Therefore colonies that spring from the felt wants and\r\nnatural impulses of a whole people will have the most solid\r\nfoundations; and their subsequent growth will be surest when they are\r\nleast trammelled from home, if the people have the genius for\r\nindependent action. Men of the past three centuries have keenly felt\r\nthe value to the mother-country of colonies as outlets for the home\r\nproducts and as a nursery for commerce and shipping; but efforts at\r\ncolonization have not had the same general origin, nor have different\r\nsystems all had the same success. The efforts of statesmen, however\r\nfar-seeing and careful, have not been able to supply the lack of\r\nstrong natural impulse; nor can the most minute regulation from home\r\nproduce as good results as a happier neglect, when the germ of\r\nself-development is found in the national character. There has been no\r\ngreater display of wisdom in the national administration of successful\r\ncolonies than in that of unsuccessful. Perhaps there has been even\r\nless. If elaborate system and supervision, careful adaptation of means\r\nto ends, diligent nursing, could avail for colonial growth, the genius\r\nof England has less of this systematizing faculty than the genius of\r\nFrance; but England, not France, has been the great colonizer of the\r\nworld. Successful colonization, with its consequent effect upon\r\ncommerce and sea power, depends essentially upon national character;\r\nbecause colonies grow best when they grow of themselves, naturally.\r\nThe character of the colonist, not the care of the home government, is\r\nthe principle of the colony's growth.\r\n\r\nThis truth stands out the clearer because the general attitude of all\r\nthe home governments toward their colonies was entirely selfish.\r\nHowever founded, as soon as it was recognized to be of consequence,\r\nthe colony became to the home country a cow to be milked; to be cared\r\nfor, of course, but chiefly as a piece of property valued for the\r\nreturns it gave. Legislation was directed toward a monopoly of its\r\nexternal trade; the places in its government afforded posts of value\r\nfor occupants from the mother-country; and the colony was looked upon,\r\nas the sea still so often is, as a fit place for those who were\r\nungovernable or useless at home. The military administration, however,\r\nso long as it remains a colony, is the proper and necessary attribute\r\nof the home government.\r\n\r\nThe fact of England's unique and wonderful success as a great\r\ncolonizing nation is too evident to be dwelt upon; and the reason for\r\nit appears to lie chiefly in two traits of the national character.\r\nThe English colonist naturally and readily settles down in his new\r\ncountry, identifies his interest with it, and though keeping an\r\naffectionate remembrance of the home from which he came, has no\r\nrestless eagerness to return. In the second place, the Englishman at\r\nonce and instinctively seeks to develop the resources of the new\r\ncountry in the broadest sense. In the former particular he differs\r\nfrom the French, who were ever longingly looking back to the delights\r\nof their pleasant land; in the latter, from the Spaniards, whose range\r\nof interest and ambition was too narrow for the full evolution of the\r\npossibilities of a new country.\r\n\r\nThe character and the necessities of the Dutch led them naturally to\r\nplant colonies; and by the year 1650 they had in the East Indies, in\r\nAfrica, and in America a large number, only to name which would be\r\ntedious. They were then far ahead of England in this matter. But\r\nthough the origin of these colonies, purely commercial in its\r\ncharacter, was natural, there seems to have been lacking to them a\r\nprinciple of growth. \"In planting them they never sought an extension\r\nof empire, but merely an acquisition of trade and commerce. They\r\nattempted conquest only when forced by the pressure of circumstances.\r\nGenerally they were content to trade under the protection of the\r\nsovereign of the country.\" This placid satisfaction with gain alone,\r\nunaccompanied by political ambition, tended, like the despotism of\r\nFrance and Spain, to keep the colonies mere commercial dependencies\r\nupon the mother-country, and so killed the natural principle of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting this head of the inquiry, it is well to ask how far\r\nthe national character of Americans is fitted to develop a great sea\r\npower, should other circumstances become favorable.\r\n\r\nIt seems scarcely necessary, however, to do more than appeal to a not\r\nvery distant past to prove that, if legislative hindrances be removed,\r\nand more remunerative fields of enterprise filled up, the sea power\r\nwill not long delay its appearance. The instinct for commerce, bold\r\nenterprise in the pursuit of gain, and a keen scent for the trails\r\nthat lead to it, all exist; and if there be in the future any fields\r\ncalling for colonization, it cannot be doubted that Americans will\r\ncarry to them all their inherited aptitude for self-government and\r\nindependent growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. _Character of the Government._--In discussing the effects upon the\r\ndevelopment of a nation's sea power exerted by its government and\r\ninstitutions, it will be necessary to avoid a tendency to\r\nover-philosophizing, to confine attention to obvious and immediate\r\ncauses and their plain results, without prying too far beneath the\r\nsurface for remote and ultimate influences.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it must be noted that particular forms of government\r\nwith their accompanying institutions, and the character of rulers at\r\none time or another, have exercised a very marked influence upon the\r\ndevelopment of sea power. The various traits of a country and its\r\npeople which have so far been considered constitute the natural\r\ncharacteristics with which a nation, like a man, begins its career;\r\nthe conduct of the government in turn corresponds to the exercise of\r\nthe intelligent will-power, which, according as it is wise, energetic\r\nand persevering, or the reverse, causes success or failure in a man's\r\nlife or a nation's history.\r\n\r\nIt would seem probable that a government in full accord with the\r\nnatural bias of its people would most successfully advance its growth\r\nin every respect; and, in the matter of sea power, the most brilliant\r\nsuccesses have followed where there has been intelligent direction by\r\na government fully imbued with the spirit of the people and conscious\r\nof its true general bent. Such a government is most certainly secured\r\nwhen the will of the people, or of their best natural exponents, has\r\nsome large share in making it; but such free governments have\r\nsometimes fallen short, while on the other hand despotic power,\r\nwielded with judgment and consistency, has created at times a great\r\nsea commerce and a brilliant navy with greater directness than can be\r\nreached by the slower processes of a free people. The difficulty in\r\nthe latter case is to insure perseverance after the death of a\r\nparticular despot.\r\n\r\nEngland having undoubtedly reached the greatest height of sea power of\r\nany modern nation, the action of her government first claims\r\nattention. In general direction this action has been consistent,\r\nthough often far from praiseworthy. It has aimed steadily at the\r\ncontrol of the sea. One of its most arrogant expressions dates back as\r\nfar as the reign of James I., when she had scarce any possessions\r\noutside her own islands; before Virginia or Massachusetts was settled.\r\nHere is Richelieu's account of it:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Duke of Sully, minister of Henry IV. [one of the most\r\n    chivalrous princes that ever lived], having embarked at Calais\r\n    in a French ship wearing the French flag at the main, was no\r\n    sooner in the Channel than, meeting an English despatch-boat\r\n    which was there to receive him, the commander of the latter\r\n    ordered the French ship to lower her flag. The Duke, considering\r\n    that his quality freed him from such an affront, boldly refused;\r\n    but this refusal was followed by three cannon-shot, which,\r\n    piercing his ship, pierced the heart likewise of all good\r\n    Frenchmen. Might forced him to yield what right forbade, and for\r\n    all the complaints he made he could get no better reply from the\r\n    English captain than this: 'That just as his duty obliged him to\r\n    honor the ambassador's rank, it also obliged him to exact the\r\n    honor due to the flag of his master as sovereign of the sea.' If\r\n    the words of King James himself were more polite, they\r\n    nevertheless had no other effect than to compel the Duke to take\r\n    counsel of his prudence, feigning to be satisfied, while his\r\n    wound was all the time smarting and incurable. Henry the Great\r\n    had to practise moderation on this occasion; but with the\r\n    resolve another time to sustain the rights of his crown by the\r\n    force that, with the aid of time, he should be able to put upon\r\n    the sea.\"\r\n\r\nThis act of unpardonable insolence, according to modern ideas, was not\r\nso much out of accord with the spirit of nations in that day. It is\r\nchiefly noteworthy as the most striking, as well as one of the\r\nearliest indications of the purpose of England to assert herself at\r\nall risks upon the sea; and the insult was offered under one of her\r\nmost timid kings to an ambassador immediately representing the\r\nbravest and ablest of French sovereigns. This empty honor of the flag,\r\na claim insignificant except as the outward manifestation of the\r\npurpose of a government, was as rigidly exacted under Cromwell as\r\nunder the kings. It was one of the conditions of peace yielded by the\r\nDutch after their disastrous war of 1654. Cromwell, a despot in\r\neverything but name, was keenly alive to all that concerned England's\r\nhonor and strength, and did not stop at barren salutes to promote\r\nthem. Hardly yet possessed of power, the English navy sprang rapidly\r\ninto a new life and vigor under his stern rule. England's rights, or\r\nreparation for her wrongs, were demanded by her fleets throughout the\r\nworld,--in the Baltic, in the Mediterranean, against the Barbary\r\nStates, in the West Indies; and under him the conquest of Jamaica\r\nbegan that extension of her empire, by force of arms, which has gone\r\non to our own days. Nor were equally strong peaceful measures for the\r\ngrowth of English trade and shipping forgotten. Cromwell's celebrated\r\nNavigation Act declared that all imports into England or her colonies\r\nmust be conveyed exclusively in vessels belonging to England herself,\r\nor to the country in which the products carried were grown or\r\nmanufactured. This decree, aimed specially at the Dutch, the common\r\ncarriers of Europe, was resented throughout the commercial world; but\r\nthe benefit to England, in those days of national strife and\r\nanimosity, was so apparent that it lasted long under the monarchy. A\r\ncentury and a quarter later we find Nelson, before his famous career\r\nhad begun, showing his zeal for the welfare of England's shipping by\r\nenforcing this same act in the West Indies against American\r\nmerchant-ships. When Cromwell was dead, and Charles II. sat on the\r\nthrone of his father, this king, false to the English people, was yet\r\ntrue to England's greatness and to the traditional policy of her\r\ngovernment on the sea. In his treacherous intrigues with Louis XIV.,\r\nby which he aimed to make himself independent of Parliament and\r\npeople, he wrote to Louis: \"There are two impediments to a perfect\r\nunion. The first is the great care France is now taking to create a\r\ncommerce and to be an imposing maritime power. This is so great a\r\ncause of suspicion with us, who can possess importance only by our\r\ncommerce and our naval force, that every step which France takes in\r\nthis direction will perpetuate the jealousy between the two nations.\"\r\nIn the midst of the negotiations which preceded the detestable attack\r\nof the two kings upon the Dutch republic, a warm dispute arose as to\r\nwho should command the united fleets of France and England. Charles\r\nwas inflexible on this point. \"It is the custom of the English,\" said\r\nhe, \"to command at sea;\" and he told the French ambassador plainly\r\nthat, were he to yield, his subjects would not obey him. In the\r\nprojected partition of the United Provinces he reserved for England\r\nthe maritime plunder in positions that controlled the mouths of the\r\nrivers Scheldt and Meuse. The navy under Charles preserved for some\r\ntime the spirit and discipline impressed on it by Cromwell's iron\r\nrule; though later it shared in the general decay of _morale_ which\r\nmarked this evil reign. Monk, having by a great strategic blunder sent\r\noff a fourth of his fleet, found himself in 1666 in presence of a\r\ngreatly superior Dutch force. Disregarding the odds, he attacked\r\nwithout hesitation, and for three days maintained the fight with\r\nhonor, though with loss. Such conduct is not war; but in the single\r\neye that looked to England's naval prestige and dictated his action,\r\ncommon as it was to England's people as well as to her government, has\r\nlain the secret of final success following many blunders through the\r\ncenturies. Charles's successor, James II., was himself a seaman, and\r\nhad commanded in two great sea-fights. When William III. came to the\r\nthrone, the governments of England and Holland were under one hand,\r\nand continued united in one purpose against Louis XIV. until the Peace\r\nof Utrecht in 1713; that is, for a quarter of a century. The English\r\ngovernment more and more steadily, and with conscious purpose, pushed\r\non the extension of her sea dominion and fostered the growth of her\r\nsea power. While as an open enemy she struck at France upon the sea,\r\nso as an artful friend, many at least believed, she sapped the power\r\nof Holland afloat. The treaty between the two countries provided that\r\nof the sea forces Holland should furnish three eighths, England five\r\neighths, or nearly double. Such a provision, coupled with a further\r\none which made Holland keep up an army of 102,000 against England's\r\n40,000, virtually threw the land war on one and the sea war on the\r\nother. The tendency, whether designed or not, is evident; and at the\r\npeace, while Holland received compensation by land, England obtained,\r\nbesides commercial privileges in France, Spain, and the Spanish West\r\nIndies, the important maritime concessions of Gibraltar and Port Mahon\r\nin the Mediterranean; of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Hudson's Bay\r\nin North America. The naval power of France and Spain had disappeared;\r\nthat of Holland thenceforth steadily declined. Posted thus in America,\r\nthe West Indies, and the Mediterranean, the English government\r\nthenceforth moved firmly forward on the path which made of the English\r\nkingdom the British Empire. For the twenty-five years following the\r\nPeace of Utrecht, peace was the chief aim of the ministers who\r\ndirected the policy of the two great seaboard nations, France and\r\nEngland; but amid all the fluctuations of continental politics in a\r\nmost unsettled period, abounding in petty wars and shifty treaties,\r\nthe eye of England was steadily fixed on the maintenance of her sea\r\npower. In the Baltic, her fleets checked the attempts of Peter the\r\nGreat upon Sweden, and so maintained a balance of power in that sea,\r\nfrom which she drew not only a great trade but the chief part of her\r\nnaval stores, and which the Czar aimed to make a Russian lake. Denmark\r\nendeavored to establish an East India company aided by foreign\r\ncapital; England and Holland not only forbade their subjects to join\r\nit, but threatened Denmark, and thus stopped an enterprise they\r\nthought adverse to their sea interests. In the Netherlands, which by\r\nthe Utrecht Treaty had passed to Austria, a similar East India\r\ncompany, having Ostend for its port, was formed, with the emperor's\r\nsanction. This step, meant to restore to the Low Countries the trade\r\nlost to them through their natural outlet of the Scheldt, was opposed\r\nby the sea powers England and Holland; and their greediness for the\r\nmonopoly of trade, helped in this instance by France, stifled this\r\ncompany also after a few years of struggling life. In the\r\nMediterranean, the Utrecht settlement was disturbed by the emperor of\r\nAustria, England's natural ally in the then existing state of European\r\npolitics. Backed by England, he, having already Naples, claimed also\r\nSicily in exchange for Sardinia. Spain resisted; and her navy, just\r\nbeginning to revive under a vigorous minister, Alberoni, was crushed\r\nand annihilated by the English fleet off Cape Passaro in 1718; while\r\nthe following year a French army, at the bidding of England, crossed\r\nthe Pyrenees and completed the work by destroying the Spanish\r\ndock-yards. Thus England, in addition to Gibraltar and Mahon in her\r\nown hands, saw Naples and Sicily in those of a friend, while an enemy\r\nwas struck down. In Spanish America, the limited privileges to English\r\ntrade, wrung from the necessities of Spain, were abused by an\r\nextensive and scarcely disguised smuggling system; and when the\r\nexasperated Spanish government gave way to excesses in the mode of\r\nsuppression, both the minister who counselled peace and the opposition\r\nwhich urged war defended their opinions by alleging the effects of\r\neither upon England's sea power and honor. While England's policy thus\r\nsteadily aimed at widening and strengthening the bases of her sway\r\nupon the ocean, the other governments of Europe seemed blind to the\r\ndangers to be feared from her sea growth. The miseries resulting from\r\nthe overweening power of Spain in days long gone by seemed to be\r\nforgotten; forgotten also the more recent lesson of the bloody and\r\ncostly wars provoked by the ambition and exaggerated power of Louis\r\nXIV. Under the eyes of the statesmen of Europe there was steadily and\r\nvisibly being built up a third overwhelming power, destined to be used\r\nas selfishly, as aggressively, though not as cruelly, and much more\r\nsuccessfully than any that had preceded it. This was the power of the\r\nsea, whose workings, because more silent than the clash of arms, are\r\nless often noted, though lying clearly enough on the surface. It can\r\nscarcely be denied that England's uncontrolled dominion of the seas,\r\nduring almost the whole period chosen for our subject, was by long\r\nodds the chief among the military factors that determined the final\r\nissue.[8] So far, however, was this influence from being foreseen\r\nafter Utrecht, that France for twelve years, moved by personal\r\nexigencies of her rulers, sided with England against Spain; and when\r\nFleuri came into power in 1726, though this policy was reversed, the\r\nnavy of France received no attention, and the only blow at England was\r\nthe establishment of a Bourbon prince, a natural enemy to her, upon\r\nthe throne of the two Sicilies in 1736. When war broke out with Spain\r\nin 1739, the navy of England was in numbers more than equal to the\r\ncombined navies of Spain and France; and during the quarter of a\r\ncentury of nearly uninterrupted war that followed, this numerical\r\ndisproportion increased. In these wars England, at first\r\ninstinctively, afterward with conscious purpose under a government\r\nthat recognized her opportunity and the possibilities of her great sea\r\npower, rapidly built up that mighty colonial empire whose foundations\r\nwere already securely laid in the characteristics of her colonists and\r\nthe strength of her fleets. In strictly European affairs her wealth,\r\nthe outcome of her sea power, made her play a conspicuous part during\r\nthe same period. The system of subsidies, which began half a century\r\nbefore in the wars of Marlborough and received its most extensive\r\ndevelopment half a century later in the Napoleonic wars, maintained\r\nthe efforts of her allies, which would have been crippled, if not\r\nparalyzed, without them. Who can deny that the government which with\r\none hand strengthened its fainting allies on the continent with the\r\nlife-blood of money, and with the other drove its own enemies off the\r\nsea and out of their chief possessions, Canada, Martinique,\r\nGuadeloupe, Havana, Manila, gave to its country the foremost rôle in\r\nEuropean politics; and who can fail to see that the power which dwelt\r\nin that government, with a land narrow in extent and poor in\r\nresources, sprang directly from the sea? The policy in which the\r\nEnglish government carried on the war is shown by a speech of Pitt,\r\nthe master-spirit during its course, though he lost office before\r\nbringing it to an end. Condemning the Peace of 1763, made by his\r\npolitical opponent, he said: \"France is chiefly, if not exclusively,\r\nformidable to us as a maritime and commercial power. What we gain in\r\nthis respect is valuable to us, above all, through the injury to her\r\nwhich results from it. You have left to France the possibility of\r\nreviving her navy.\" Yet England's gains were enormous; her rule in\r\nIndia was assured, and all North America east of the Mississippi in\r\nher hands. By this time the onward path of her government was clearly\r\nmarked out, had assumed the force of a tradition, and was consistently\r\nfollowed. The war of the American Revolution was, it is true, a great\r\nmistake, looked at from the point of view of sea power; but the\r\ngovernment was led into it insensibly by a series of natural blunders.\r\nPutting aside political and constitutional considerations, and looking\r\nat the question as purely military or naval, the case was this: The\r\nAmerican colonies were large and growing communities at a great\r\ndistance from England. So long as they remained attached to the\r\nmother-country, as they then were enthusiastically, they formed a\r\nsolid base for her sea power in that part of the world; but their\r\nextent and population were too great, when coupled with the distance\r\nfrom England, to afford any hope of holding them by force, _if_ any\r\npowerful nations were willing to help them. This \"if,\" however,\r\ninvolved a notorious probability; the humiliation of France and Spain\r\nwas so bitter and so recent that they were sure to seek revenge, and\r\nit was well known that France in particular had been carefully and\r\nrapidly building up her navy. Had the colonies been thirteen islands,\r\nthe sea power of England would quickly have settled the question; but\r\ninstead of such a physical barrier they were separated only by local\r\njealousies which a common danger sufficiently overcame. To enter\r\ndeliberately on such a contest, to try to hold by force so extensive a\r\nterritory, with a large hostile population, so far from home, was to\r\nrenew the Seven Years' War with France and Spain, and with the\r\nAmericans, against, instead of for, England. The Seven Years' War had\r\nbeen so heavy a burden that a wise government would have known that\r\nthe added weight could not be borne, and have seen it was necessary to\r\nconciliate the colonists. The government of the day was not wise, and\r\na large element of England's sea power was sacrificed; but by mistake,\r\nnot wilfully; through arrogance, not through weakness.\r\n\r\nThis steady keeping to a general line of policy was doubtless made\r\nspecially easy for successive English governments by the clear\r\nindications of the country's conditions. Singleness of purpose was to\r\nsome extent imposed. The firm maintenance of her sea power, the\r\nhaughty determination to make it felt, the wise state of preparation\r\nin which its military element was kept, were yet more due to that\r\nfeature of her political institutions which practically gave the\r\ngovernment, during the period in question, into the hands of a\r\nclass,--a landed aristocracy. Such a class, whatever its defects\r\notherwise, readily takes up and carries on a sound political\r\ntradition, is naturally proud of its country's glory, and\r\ncomparatively insensible to the sufferings of the community by which\r\nthat glory is maintained. It readily lays on the pecuniary burden\r\nnecessary for preparation and for endurance of war. Being as a body\r\nrich, it feels those burdens less. Not being commercial, the sources\r\nof its own wealth are not so immediately endangered, and it does not\r\nshare that political timidity which characterizes those whose property\r\nis exposed and business threatened,--the proverbial timidity of\r\ncapital. Yet in England this class was not insensible to anything that\r\ntouched her trade for good or ill. Both houses of Parliament vied in\r\ncareful watchfulness over its extension and protection, and to the\r\nfrequency of their inquiries a naval historian attributes the\r\nincreased efficiency of the executive power in its management of the\r\nnavy. Such a class also naturally imbibes and keeps up a spirit of\r\nmilitary honor, which is of the first importance in ages when military\r\ninstitutions have not yet provided the sufficient substitute in what\r\nis called _esprit-de-corps_. But although full of class feeling and\r\nclass prejudice, which made themselves felt in the navy as well as\r\nelsewhere, their practical sense left open the way of promotion to its\r\nhighest honors to the more humbly born; and every age saw admirals who\r\nhad sprung from the lowest of the people. In this the temper of the\r\nEnglish upper class differed markedly from that of the French. As late\r\nas 1789, at the outbreak of the Revolution, the French Navy List still\r\nbore the name of an official whose duty was to verify the proofs of\r\nnoble birth on the part of those intending to enter the naval school.\r\n\r\nSince 1815, and especially in our own day, the government of England\r\nhas passed very much more into the hands of the people at large.\r\nWhether her sea power will suffer therefrom remains to be seen. Its\r\nbroad basis still remains in a great trade, large mechanical\r\nindustries, and an extensive colonial system. Whether a democratic\r\ngovernment will have the foresight, the keen sensitiveness to national\r\nposition and credit, the willingness to insure its prosperity by\r\nadequate outpouring of money in times of peace, all which are\r\nnecessary for military preparation, is yet an open question. Popular\r\ngovernments are not generally favorable to military expenditure,\r\nhowever necessary, and there are signs that England tends to drop\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nIt has already been seen that the Dutch Republic, even more than the\r\nEnglish nation, drew its prosperity and its very life from the sea.\r\nThe character and policy of its government were far less favorable to\r\na consistent support of sea power. Composed of seven provinces, with\r\nthe political name of the United Provinces, the actual distribution of\r\npower may be roughly described to Americans as an exaggerated example\r\nof States Rights. Each of the maritime provinces had its own fleet and\r\nits own admiralty, with consequent jealousies. This disorganizing\r\ntendency was partly counteracted by the great preponderance of the\r\nProvince of Holland, which alone contributed five sixths of the fleet\r\nand fifty-eight per cent of the taxes, and consequently had a\r\nproportionate share in directing the national policy. Although\r\nintensely patriotic, and capable of making the last sacrifices for\r\nfreedom, the commercial spirit of the people penetrated the\r\ngovernment, which indeed might be called a commercial aristocracy, and\r\nmade it averse to war, and to the expenditures which are necessary in\r\npreparing for war. As has before been said, it was not until danger\r\nstared them in the face that the burgomasters were willing to pay for\r\ntheir defences. While the republican government lasted, however, this\r\neconomy was practised least of all upon the fleet; and until the death\r\nof John De Witt, in 1672, and the peace with England in 1674, the\r\nDutch navy was in point of numbers and equipment able to make a fair\r\nshow against the combined navies of England and France. Its efficiency\r\nat this time undoubtedly saved the country from the destruction\r\nplanned by the two kings. With De Witt's death the republic passed\r\naway, and was followed by the practically monarchical government of\r\nWilliam of Orange. The life-long policy of this prince, then only\r\neighteen, was resistance to Louis XIV. and to the extension of French\r\npower. This resistance took shape upon the land rather than the\r\nsea,--a tendency promoted by England's withdrawal from the war. As\r\nearly as 1676, Admiral De Ruyter found the force given him unequal to\r\ncope with the French alone. With the eyes of the government fixed on\r\nthe land frontier, the navy rapidly declined. In 1688, when William of\r\nOrange needed a fleet to convoy him to England, the burgomasters of\r\nAmsterdam objected that the navy was incalculably decreased in\r\nstrength, as well as deprived of its ablest commanders. When king of\r\nEngland, William still kept his position as stadtholder, and with it\r\nhis general European policy. He found in England the sea power he\r\nneeded, and used the resources of Holland for the land war. This Dutch\r\nprince consented that in the allied fleets, in councils of war, the\r\nDutch admirals should sit below the junior English captain; and Dutch\r\ninterests at sea were sacrificed as readily as Dutch pride to the\r\ndemands of England. When William died, his policy was still followed\r\nby the government which succeeded him. Its aims were wholly centred\r\nupon the land, and at the Peace of Utrecht, which closed a series of\r\nwars extending over forty years, Holland, having established no sea\r\nclaim, gained nothing in the way of sea resources, of colonial\r\nextension, or of commerce.\r\n\r\nOf the last of these wars an English historian says: \"The economy of\r\nthe Dutch greatly hurt their reputation and their trade. Their\r\nmen-of-war in the Mediterranean were always victualled short, and\r\ntheir convoys were so weak and ill-provided that for one ship that we\r\nlost, they lost five, which begat a general notion that we were the\r\nsafer carriers, which certainly had a good effect. Hence it was that\r\nour trade rather increased than diminished in this war.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that time Holland ceased to have a great sea power, and rapidly\r\nlost the leading position among the nations which that power had built\r\nup. It is only just to say that no policy could have saved from\r\ndecline this small, though determined, nation, in face of the\r\npersistent enmity of Louis XIV. The friendship of France, insuring\r\npeace on her landward frontier, would have enabled her, at least for a\r\nlonger time, to dispute with England the dominion of the seas; and as\r\nallies the navies of the two continental States might have checked the\r\ngrowth of the enormous sea power which has just been considered. Sea\r\npeace between England and Holland was only possible by the virtual\r\nsubjection of one or the other, for both aimed at the same object.\r\nBetween France and Holland it was otherwise; and the fall of Holland\r\nproceeded, not necessarily from her inferior size and numbers, but\r\nfrom faulty policy on the part of the two governments. It does not\r\nconcern us to decide which was the more to blame.\r\n\r\nFrance, admirably situated for the possession of sea power, received a\r\ndefinite policy for the guidance of her government from two great\r\nrulers, Henry IV. and Richelieu. With certain well-defined projects of\r\nextension eastward upon the land were combined a steady resistance to\r\nthe House of Austria, which then ruled in both Austria and Spain, and\r\nan equal purpose of resistance to England upon the sea. To further\r\nthis latter end, as well as for other reasons, Holland was to be\r\ncourted as an ally. Commerce and fisheries as the basis of sea power\r\nwere to be encouraged, and a military navy was to be built up.\r\nRichelieu left what he called his political will, in which he pointed\r\nout the opportunities of France for achieving sea power, based upon\r\nher position and resources; and French writers consider him the\r\nvirtual founder of the navy, not merely because he equipped ships, but\r\nfrom the breadth of his views and his measures to insure sound\r\ninstitutions and steady growth. After his death, Mazarin inherited his\r\nviews and general policy, but not his lofty and martial spirit, and\r\nduring his rule the newly formed navy disappeared. When Louis XIV.\r\ntook the government into his own hands, in 1661, there were but thirty\r\nships of war, of which only three had as many as sixty guns. Then\r\nbegan a most astonishing manifestation of the work which can be done\r\nby absolute government ably and systematically wielded. That part of\r\nthe administration which dealt with trade, manufactures, shipping, and\r\ncolonies, was given to a man of great practical genius, Colbert, who\r\nhad served with Richelieu and had drunk in fully his ideas and policy.\r\nHe pursued his aims in a spirit thoroughly French. Everything was to\r\nbe organized, the spring of everything was in the minister's cabinet.\r\n\"To organize producers and merchants as a powerful army, subjected to\r\nan active and intelligent guidance, so as to secure an industrial\r\nvictory for France by order and unity of efforts, and to obtain the\r\nbest products by imposing on all workmen the processes recognized as\r\nbest by competent men.... To organize seamen and distant commerce in\r\nlarge bodies like the manufactures and internal commerce, and to give\r\nas a support to the commercial power of France a navy established on a\r\nfirm basis and of dimensions hitherto unknown,\"--such, we are told,\r\nwere the aims of Colbert as regards two of the three links in the\r\nchain of sea power. For the third, the colonies at the far end of the\r\nline, the same governmental direction and organization were evidently\r\npurposed; for the government began by buying back Canada,\r\nNewfoundland, Nova Scotia, and the French West India Islands from the\r\nparties who then owned them. Here, then, is seen pure, absolute,\r\nuncontrolled power gathering up into its hands all the reins for the\r\nguidance of a nation's course, and proposing so to direct it as to\r\nmake, among other things, a great sea power.\r\n\r\nTo enter into the details of Colbert's action is beyond our purpose.\r\nIt is enough to note the chief part played by the government in\r\nbuilding up the sea power of the State, and that this very great man\r\nlooked not to any one of the bases on which it rests to the exclusion\r\nof the others, but embraced them all in his wise and provident\r\nadministration. Agriculture, which increases the products of the\r\nearth, and manufactures, which multiply the products of man's\r\nindustry; internal trade routes and regulations, by which the exchange\r\nof products from the interior to the exterior is made easier; shipping\r\nand customs regulations tending to throw the carrying-trade into\r\nFrench hands, and so to encourage the building of French shipping, by\r\nwhich the home and colonial products should be carried back and forth;\r\ncolonial administration and development, by which a far-off market\r\nmight be continually growing up to be monopolized by the home trade;\r\ntreaties with foreign States favoring French trade, and imposts on\r\nforeign ships and products tending to break down that of rival\r\nnations,--all these means, embracing countless details, were employed\r\nto build up for France (1) Production; (2) Shipping; (3) Colonies and\r\nMarkets,--in a word, sea power. The study of such a work is simpler\r\nand easier when thus done by one man, sketched out by a kind of\r\nlogical process, than when slowly wrought by conflicting interests in\r\na more complex government. In the few years of Colbert's\r\nadministration is seen the whole theory of sea power put into practice\r\nin the systematic, centralizing French way; while the illustration of\r\nthe same theory in English and Dutch history is spread over\r\ngenerations. Such growth, however, was forced, and depended upon the\r\nendurance of the absolute power which watched over it; and as Colbert\r\nwas not king, his control lasted only till he lost the king's favor.\r\nIt is, however, most interesting to note the results of his labors in\r\nthe proper field for governmental action--in the navy. It has been\r\nsaid that in 1661, when he took office, there were but thirty armed\r\nships, of which three only had over sixty guns. In 1666 there were\r\nseventy, of which fifty were ships of the line and twenty were\r\nfire-ships; in 1671, from seventy the number had increased to one\r\nhundred and ninety-six. In 1683 there were one hundred and seven ships\r\nof from twenty-four to one hundred and twenty guns, twelve of which\r\ncarried over seventy-six guns, besides many smaller vessels. The order\r\nand system introduced into the dock-yards made them vastly more\r\nefficient than the English. An English captain, a prisoner in France\r\nwhile the effect of Colbert's work still lasted in the hands of his\r\nson, writes:--\r\n\r\n    \"When I was first brought prisoner thither, I lay four months in\r\n    a hospital at Brest for care of my wounds. While there I was\r\n    astonished at the expedition used in manning and fitting out\r\n    their ships, which till then I thought could be done nowhere\r\n    sooner than in England, where we have ten times the shipping,\r\n    and consequently ten times the seamen, they have in France; but\r\n    there I saw twenty sail of ships, of about sixty guns each, got\r\n    ready in twenty days' time; they were brought in and the men\r\n    were discharged; and upon an order from Paris they were\r\n    careened, keeled up, rigged, victualled, manned, and out again\r\n    in the said time with the greatest ease imaginable. I likewise\r\n    saw a ship of one hundred guns that had all her guns taken out\r\n    in four or five hours' time; which I never saw done in England\r\n    in twenty-four hours, and this with the greatest ease and less\r\n    hazard than at home. This I saw under my hospital window.\"\r\n\r\nA French naval historian cites certain performances which are simply\r\nincredible, such as that the keel of a galley was laid at four\r\no'clock, and that at nine she left port, fully armed. These traditions\r\nmay be accepted as pointing, with the more serious statements of the\r\nEnglish officer, to a remarkable degree of system and order, and\r\nabundant facilities for work.\r\n\r\nYet all this wonderful growth, forced by the action of the government,\r\nwithered away like Jonah's gourd when the government's favor was\r\nwithdrawn. Time was not allowed for its roots to strike down deep into\r\nthe life of the nation. Colbert's work was in the direct line of\r\nRichelieu's policy, and for a time it seemed there would continue the\r\ncourse of action which would make France great upon the sea as well as\r\npredominant upon the land. For reasons which it is not yet necessary\r\nto give, Louis came to have feelings of bitter enmity against Holland;\r\nand as these feelings were shared by Charles II., the two kings\r\ndetermined on the destruction of the United Provinces. This war, which\r\nbroke out in 1672, though more contrary to natural feeling on the part\r\nof England, was less of a political mistake for her than for France,\r\nand especially as regards sea power. France was helping to destroy a\r\nprobable, and certainly an indispensable, ally; England was assisting\r\nin the ruin of her greatest rival on the sea, at this time, indeed,\r\nstill her commercial superior. France, staggering under debt and utter\r\nconfusion in her finances when Louis mounted the throne, was just\r\nseeing her way clear in 1672, under Colbert's reforms and their happy\r\nresults. The war, lasting six years, undid the greater part of his\r\nwork. The agricultural classes, manufactures, commerce, and the\r\ncolonies, all were smitten by it; the establishments of Colbert\r\nlanguished, and the order he had established in the finances was\r\noverthrown. Thus the action of Louis--and he alone was the directing\r\ngovernment of France--struck at the roots of her sea power, and\r\nalienated her best sea ally. The territory and the military power of\r\nFrance were increased, but the springs of commerce and of a peaceful\r\nshipping had been exhausted in the process; and although the military\r\nnavy was for some years kept up with splendor and efficiency, it soon\r\nbegan to dwindle, and by the end of the reign had practically\r\ndisappeared. The same false policy, as regards the sea, marked the\r\nrest of this reign of fifty-four years. Louis steadily turned his back\r\nupon the sea interests of France, except the fighting-ships, and\r\neither could not or would not see that the latter were of little use\r\nand uncertain life, if the peaceful shipping and the industries, by\r\nwhich they were supported, perished. His policy, aiming at supreme\r\npower in Europe by military strength and territorial extension, forced\r\nEngland and Holland into an alliance, which, as has before been said,\r\ndirectly drove France off the sea, and indirectly swamped Holland's\r\npower thereon. Colbert's navy perished, and for the last ten years of\r\nLouis' life no great French fleet put to sea, though there was\r\nconstant war. The simplicity of form in an absolute monarchy thus\r\nbrought out strongly how great the influence of government can be upon\r\nboth the growth and the decay of sea power.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of Louis' life thus witnessed that power failing by\r\nthe weakening of its foundations, of commerce, and of the wealth that\r\ncommerce brings. The government that followed, likewise absolute, of\r\nset purpose and at the demand of England, gave up all pretence of\r\nmaintaining an effective navy. The reason for this was that the new\r\nking was a minor; and the regent, being bitterly at enmity with the\r\nking of Spain, to injure him and preserve his own power, entered into\r\nalliance with England. He aided her to establish Austria, the\r\nhereditary enemy of France, in Naples and Sicily to the detriment of\r\nSpain, and in union with her destroyed the Spanish navy and\r\ndock-yards. Here again is found a personal ruler disregarding the sea\r\ninterests of France, ruining a natural ally, and directly aiding, as\r\nLouis XIV. indirectly and unintentionally aided, the growth of a\r\nmistress of the seas. This transient phase of policy passed away with\r\nthe death of the regent in 1726; but from that time until 1760 the\r\ngovernment of France continued to disregard her maritime interests. It\r\nis said, indeed, that owing to some wise modifications of her fiscal\r\nregulations, mainly in the direction of free trade (and due to Law, a\r\nminister of Scotch birth), commerce with the East and West Indies\r\nwonderfully increased, and that the islands of Guadeloupe and\r\nMartinique became very rich and thriving; but both commerce and\r\ncolonies lay at the mercy of England when war came, for the navy fell\r\ninto decay. In 1756, when things were no longer at their worst, France\r\nhad but forty-five ships-of-the-line, England nearly one hundred and\r\nthirty; and when the forty-five were to be armed and equipped, there\r\nwas found to be neither material nor rigging nor supplies; not even\r\nenough artillery. Nor was this all.\r\n\r\n    \"Lack of system in the government,\" says a French writer,\r\n    \"brought about indifference, and opened the door to disorder and\r\n    lack of discipline. Never had unjust promotions been so\r\n    frequent; so also never had more universal discontent been seen.\r\n    Money and intrigue took the place of all else, and brought in\r\n    their train commands and power. Nobles and upstarts, with\r\n    influence at the capital and self-sufficiency in the seaports,\r\n    thought themselves dispensed with merit. Waste of the revenues\r\n    of the State and of the dock-yards knew no bounds. Honor and\r\n    modesty were turned into ridicule. As if the evils were not thus\r\n    great enough, the ministry took pains to efface the heroic\r\n    traditions of the past which had escaped the general wreck. To\r\n    the energetic fights of the great reign succeeded, by order of\r\n    the court, 'affairs of circumspection.' To preserve to the\r\n    wasted material a few armed ships, increased opportunity was\r\n    given to the enemy. From this unhappy principle we were bound to\r\n    a defensive as advantageous to the enemy as it was foreign to\r\n    the genius of our people. This circumspection before the enemy,\r\n    laid down for us by orders, betrayed in the long run the\r\n    national temper; and the abuse of the system led to acts of\r\n    indiscipline and defection under fire, of which a single\r\n    instance would vainly be sought in the previous century.\"\r\n\r\nA false policy of continental extension swallowed up the resources of\r\nthe country, and was doubly injurious because, by leaving defenceless\r\nits colonies and commerce, it exposed the greatest source of wealth to\r\nbe cut off, as in fact happened. The small squadrons that got to sea\r\nwere destroyed by vastly superior force; the merchant shipping was\r\nswept away, and the colonies, Canada, Martinique, Guadeloupe, India,\r\nfell into England's hands. If it did not take too much space,\r\ninteresting extracts might be made, showing the woful misery of\r\nFrance, the country that had abandoned the sea, and the growing wealth\r\nof England amid all her sacrifices and exertions. A contemporary\r\nwriter has thus expressed his view of the policy of France at this\r\nperiod:--\r\n\r\n    \"France, by engaging so heartily as she has done in the German\r\n    war, has drawn away so much of her attention and her revenue\r\n    from her navy that it enabled us to give such a blow to her\r\n    maritime strength as possibly she may never be able to recover.\r\n    Her engagement in the German war has likewise drawn her from the\r\n    defence of her colonies, by which means we have conquered some\r\n    of the most considerable she possessed. It has withdrawn her\r\n    from the protection of her trade, by which it is entirely\r\n    destroyed, while that of England has never, in the profoundest\r\n    peace, been in so flourishing a condition. So that, by embarking\r\n    in this German war, France has suffered herself to be undone, so\r\n    far as regards her particular and immediate quarrel with\r\n    England.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Seven Years' War France lost thirty-seven ships-of-the-line and\r\nfifty-six frigates,--a force three times as numerous as the whole navy\r\nof the United States at any time in the days of sailing-ships. \"For\r\nthe first time since the Middle Ages,\" says a French historian,\r\nspeaking of the same war, \"England had conquered France single-handed,\r\nalmost without allies, France having powerful auxiliaries. She had\r\nconquered solely by the superiority of her government.\" Yes; but it\r\nwas by the superiority of her government using the tremendous weapon\r\nof her sea power,--the reward of a consistent policy perseveringly\r\ndirected to one aim.\r\n\r\nThe profound humiliation of France, which reached its depths between\r\n1760 and 1763, at which latter date she made peace, has an instructive\r\nlesson for the United States in this our period of commercial and\r\nnaval decadence. We have been spared her humiliation; let us hope to\r\nprofit by her subsequent example. Between the same years (1760 and\r\n1763) the French people rose, as afterward in 1793, and declared they\r\nwould have a navy. \"Popular feeling, skilfully directed by the\r\ngovernment, took up the cry from one end of France to the other, 'The\r\nnavy must be restored.' Gifts of ships were made by cities, by\r\ncorporations, and by private subscriptions. A prodigious activity\r\nsprang up in the lately silent ports; everywhere ships were building\r\nor repairing.\" This activity was sustained; the arsenals were\r\nreplenished, the material of every kind was put on a satisfactory\r\nfooting, the artillery reorganized, and ten thousand trained gunners\r\ndrilled and maintained.\r\n\r\nThe tone and action of the naval officers of the day instantly felt\r\nthe popular impulse, for which indeed some loftier spirits among them\r\nhad been not only waiting but working. At no time was greater mental\r\nand professional activity found among French naval officers than just\r\nthen, when their ships had been suffered to rot away by governmental\r\ninaction. Thus a prominent French officer of our own day writes:--\r\n\r\n    \"The sad condition of the navy in the reign of Louis XV., by\r\n    closing to officers the brilliant career of bold enterprises and\r\n    successful battles, forced them to fall back upon themselves.\r\n    They drew from study the knowledge they were to put to the proof\r\n    some years later, thus putting into practice that fine saying of\r\n    Montesquieu, 'Adversity is our mother, Prosperity our\r\n    step-mother.'... By the year 1769 was seen in all its splendor\r\n    that brilliant galaxy of officers whose activity stretched to\r\n    the ends of the earth, and who embraced in their works and in\r\n    their investigations all the branches of human knowledge. The\r\n    Académie de Marine, founded in 1752, was reorganized.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThe Académie's first director, a post-captain named Bigot de Morogues,\r\nwrote an elaborate treatise on naval tactics, the first original work\r\non the subject since Paul Hoste's, which it was designed to supersede.\r\nMorogues must have been studying and formulating his problems in\r\ntactics in days when France had no fleet, and was unable so much as to\r\nraise her head at sea under the blows of her enemy. At the same time\r\nEngland had no similar book; and an English lieutenant, in 1762, was\r\njust translating a part of Hoste's great work, omitting by far the\r\nlarger part. It was not until nearly twenty years later that Clerk, a\r\nScotch private gentleman, published an ingenious study of naval\r\ntactics, in which he pointed out to English admirals the system by\r\nwhich the French had thwarted their thoughtless and ill-combined\r\nattacks.[10] \"The researches of the Académie de Marine, and the\r\nenergetic impulse which it gave to the labors of officers, were not,\r\nas we hope to show later, without influence upon the relatively\r\nprosperous condition in which the navy was at the beginning of the\r\nAmerican war.\"\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that the American War of Independence\r\ninvolved a departure from England's traditional and true policy, by\r\ncommitting her to a distant land war, while powerful enemies were\r\nwaiting for an opportunity to attack her at sea. Like France in the\r\nthen recent German wars, like Napoleon later in the Spanish war,\r\nEngland, through undue self-confidence, was about to turn a friend\r\ninto an enemy, and so expose the real basis of her power to a rude\r\nproof. The French government, on the other hand, avoided the snare\r\ninto which it had so often fallen. Turning her back on the European\r\ncontinent, having the probability of neutrality there, and the\r\ncertainty of alliance with Spain by her side, France advanced to the\r\ncontest with a fine navy and a brilliant, though perhaps relatively\r\ninexperienced, body of officers. On the other side of the Atlantic she\r\nhad the support of a friendly people, and of her own or allied ports,\r\nboth in the West Indies and on the continent. The wisdom of this\r\npolicy, the happy influence of this action of the government upon her\r\nsea power, is evident; but the details of the war do not belong to\r\nthis part of the subject. To Americans, the chief interest of that war\r\nis found upon the land; but to naval officers upon the sea, for it was\r\nessentially a sea war. The intelligent and systematic efforts of\r\ntwenty years bore their due fruit; for though the warfare afloat ended\r\nwith a great disaster, the combined efforts of the French and Spanish\r\nfleets undoubtedly bore down England's strength and robbed her of her\r\ncolonies. In the various naval undertakings and battles the honor of\r\nFrance was upon the whole maintained; though it is difficult, upon\r\nconsideration of the general subject, to avoid the conclusion that\r\nthe inexperience of French seamen as compared with English, the narrow\r\nspirit of jealousy shown by the noble corps of officers toward those\r\nof different antecedents, and above all, the miserable traditions of\r\nthree quarters of a century already alluded to, the miserable policy\r\nof a government which taught them first to save their ships, to\r\neconomize the material, prevented French admirals from reaping, not\r\nthe mere glory, but the positive advantages that more than once were\r\nwithin their grasp. When Monk said the nation that would rule upon the\r\nsea must always attack, he set the key-note to England's naval policy;\r\nand had the instructions of the French government consistently\r\nbreathed the same spirit, the war of 1778 might have ended sooner and\r\nbetter than it did. It seems ungracious to criticise the conduct of a\r\nservice to which, under God, our nation owes that its birth was not a\r\nmiscarriage; but writers of its own country abundantly reflect the\r\nspirit of the remark. A French officer who served afloat during this\r\nwar, in a work of calm and judicial tone, says:--\r\n\r\n    \"What must the young officers have thought who were at Sandy\r\n    Hook with D'Estaing, at St. Christopher with De Grasse, even\r\n    those who arrived at Rhode Island with De Ternay, when they saw\r\n    that these officers were not tried at their return?\"[11]\r\n\r\nAgain, another French officer, of much later date, justifies the\r\nopinion expressed, when speaking of the war of the American Revolution\r\nin the following terms:--\r\n\r\n    \"It was necessary to get rid of the unhappy prejudices of the\r\n    days of the regency and of Louis XV.; but the mishaps of which\r\n    they were full were too recent to be forgotten by our ministers.\r\n    Thanks to a wretched hesitation, fleets, which had rightly\r\n    alarmed England, became reduced to ordinary proportions.\r\n    Intrenching themselves in a false economy, the ministry claimed\r\n    that, by reason of the excessive expenses necessary to maintain\r\n    the fleet, the admirals must be ordered to maintain the\r\n    '_greatest circumspection_,' as though in war half measures have\r\n    not always led to disasters. So, too, the orders given to our\r\n    squadron chiefs were to keep the sea as long as possible,\r\n    without engaging in actions which might cause the loss of\r\n    vessels difficult to replace; so that more than once complete\r\n    victories, which would have crowned the skill of our admirals\r\n    and the courage of our captains, were changed into successes of\r\n    little importance. A system which laid down as a principle that\r\n    an admiral should not use the force in his hands, which sent him\r\n    against the enemy with the foreordained purpose of receiving\r\n    rather than making the attack, a system which sapped moral power\r\n    to save material resources, must have unhappy results.... It is\r\n    certain that this deplorable system was one of the causes of the\r\n    lack of discipline and startling defections which marked the\r\n    periods of Louis XVI., of the [first] Republic, and of the\r\n    [first] Empire.\"[12]\r\n\r\nWithin ten years of the peace of 1783 came the French Revolution; but\r\nthat great upheaval which shook the foundations of States, loosed the\r\nties of social order, and drove out of the navy nearly all the trained\r\nofficers of the monarchy who were attached to the old state of things,\r\ndid not free the French navy from a false system. It was easier to\r\noverturn the form of government than to uproot a deep-seated\r\ntradition. Hear again a third French officer, of the highest rank and\r\nliterary accomplishments, speaking of the inaction of Villeneuve, the\r\nadmiral who commanded the French rear at the battle of the Nile, and\r\nwho did not leave his anchors while the head of the column was being\r\ndestroyed:--\r\n\r\n    \"A day was to come [Trafalgar] in which Villeneuve in his turn,\r\n    like De Grasse before him, and like Duchayla, would complain of\r\n    being abandoned by part of his fleet. We have come to suspect\r\n    some secret reason for this fatal coincidence. It is not natural\r\n    that among so many honorable men there should so often be found\r\n    admirals and captains incurring such a reproach. If the name of\r\n    some of them is to this very day sadly associated with the\r\n    memory of our disasters, we may be sure the fault is not wholly\r\n    their own. We must rather blame the nature of the operations in\r\n    which they were engaged, and that system of defensive war\r\n    prescribed by the French government, which Pitt, in the English\r\n    Parliament, proclaimed to be the forerunner of certain ruin.\r\n    That system, when we wished to renounce it, had already\r\n    penetrated our habits; it had, so to say, weakened our arms and\r\n    paralyzed our self-reliance. Too often did our squadrons leave\r\n    port with a special mission to fulfil, and with the intention of\r\n    avoiding the enemy; to fall in with him was at once a piece of\r\n    bad luck. It was thus that our ships went into action; they\r\n    submitted to it instead of forcing it.... Fortune would have\r\n    hesitated longer between the two fleets, and not have borne in\r\n    the end so heavily against ours, if Brueys, meeting Nelson half\r\n    way, could have gone out to fight him. This fettered and timid\r\n    war, which Villaret and Martin had carried on, had lasted long,\r\n    thanks to the circumspection of some English admirals and the\r\n    traditions of the old tactics. It was with these traditions that\r\n    the battle of the Nile had broken; the hour for decisive action\r\n    had come.\"[13]\r\n\r\nSome years later came Trafalgar, and again the government of France\r\ntook up a new policy with the navy. The author last quoted speaks\r\nagain:--\r\n\r\n    \"The emperor, whose eagle glance traced plans of campaign for\r\n    his fleets as for his armies, was wearied by these unexpected\r\n    reverses. He turned his eyes from the one field of battle in\r\n    which fortune was faithless to him, and decided to pursue\r\n    England elsewhere than upon the seas; he undertook to rebuild\r\n    his navy, but without giving it any part in the struggle which\r\n    became more furious than ever.... Nevertheless, far from\r\n    slackening, the activity of our dock-yards redoubled. Every year\r\n    ships-of-the-line were either laid down or added to the fleet.\r\n    Venice and Genoa, under his control, saw their old splendors\r\n    rise again, and from the shores of the Elbe to the head of the\r\n    Adriatic all the ports of the continent emulously seconded the\r\n    creative thought of the emperor. Numerous squadrons were\r\n    assembled in the Scheldt, in Brest Roads, and in Toulon.... But\r\n    to the end the emperor refused to give this navy, full of ardor\r\n    and self-reliance, an opportunity to measure its strength with\r\n    the enemy.... Cast down by constant reverses, he had kept up our\r\n    armed ships only to oblige our enemies to blockades whose\r\n    enormous cost must end by exhausting their finances.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the empire fell, France had one hundred and three\r\nships-of-the-line and fifty-five frigates.\r\n\r\nTo turn now from the particular lessons drawn from the history of the\r\npast to the general question of the influence of government upon the\r\nsea career of its people, it is seen that that influence can work in\r\ntwo distinct but closely related ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, in peace: The government by its policy can favor the natural\r\ngrowth of a people's industries and its tendencies to seek adventure\r\nand gain by way of the sea; or it can try to develop such industries\r\nand such sea-going bent, when they do not naturally exist; or, on the\r\nother hand, the government may by mistaken action check and fetter the\r\nprogress which the people left to themselves would make. In any one of\r\nthese ways the influence of the government will be felt, making or\r\nmarring the sea power of the country in the matter of peaceful\r\ncommerce; upon which alone, it cannot be too often insisted, a\r\nthoroughly strong navy can be based.\r\n\r\nSecondly, for war: The influence of the government will be felt in its\r\nmost legitimate manner in maintaining an armed navy, of a size\r\ncommensurate with the growth of its shipping and the importance of the\r\ninterests connected with it. More important even than the size of the\r\nnavy is the question of its institutions, favoring a healthful spirit\r\nand activity, and providing for rapid development in time of war by an\r\nadequate reserve of men and of ships and by measures for drawing out\r\nthat general reserve power which has before been pointed to, when\r\nconsidering the character and pursuits of the people. Undoubtedly\r\nunder this second head of warlike preparation must come the\r\nmaintenance of suitable naval stations, in those distant parts of the\r\nworld to which the armed shipping must follow the peaceful vessels of\r\ncommerce. The protection of such stations must depend either upon\r\ndirect military force, as do Gibraltar and Malta, or upon a\r\nsurrounding friendly population, such as the American colonists once\r\nwere to England, and, it may be presumed, the Australian colonists now\r\nare. Such friendly surroundings and backing, joined to a reasonable\r\nmilitary provision, are the best of defences, and when combined with\r\ndecided preponderance at sea, make a scattered and extensive empire,\r\nlike that of England, secure; for while it is true that an unexpected\r\nattack may cause disaster in some one quarter, the actual superiority\r\nof naval power prevents such disaster from being general or\r\nirremediable. History has sufficiently proved this. England's naval\r\nbases have been in all parts of the world; and her fleets have at once\r\nprotected them, kept open the communications between them, and relied\r\nupon them for shelter.\r\n\r\nColonies attached to the mother-country afford, therefore, the surest\r\nmeans of supporting abroad the sea power of a country. In peace, the\r\ninfluence of the government should be felt in promoting by all means a\r\nwarmth of attachment and a unity of interest which will make the\r\nwelfare of one the welfare of all, and the quarrel of one the quarrel\r\nof all; and in war, or rather for war, by inducing such measures of\r\norganization and defence as shall be felt by all to be a fair\r\ndistribution of a burden of which each reaps the benefit.\r\n\r\nSuch colonies the United States has not and is not likely to have. As\r\nregards purely military naval stations, the feeling of her people was\r\nprobably accurately expressed by an historian of the English navy a\r\nhundred years ago, speaking then of Gibraltar and Port Mahon.\r\n\"Military governments,\" said he, \"agree so little with the industry of\r\na trading people, and are in themselves so repugnant to the genius of\r\nthe British people, that I do not wonder that men of good sense and of\r\nall parties have inclined to give up these, as Tangiers was given up.\"\r\nHaving therefore no foreign establishments, either colonial or\r\nmilitary, the ships of war of the United States, in war, will be like\r\nland birds, unable to fly far from their own shores. To provide\r\nresting-places for them, where they can coal and repair, would be one\r\nof the first duties of a government proposing to itself the\r\ndevelopment of the power of the nation at sea.\r\n\r\nAs the practical object of this inquiry is to draw from the lessons of\r\nhistory inferences applicable to one's own country and service, it is\r\nproper now to ask how far the conditions of the United States involve\r\nserious danger, and call for action on the part of the government, in\r\norder to build again her sea power. It will not be too much to say\r\nthat the action of the government since the Civil War, and up to this\r\nday, has been effectively directed solely to what has been called the\r\nfirst link in the chain which makes sea power. Internal development,\r\ngreat production, with the accompanying aim and boast of\r\nself-sufficingness, such has been the object, such to some extent the\r\nresult. In this the government has faithfully reflected the bent of\r\nthe controlling elements of the country, though it is not always easy\r\nto feel that such controlling elements are truly representative, even\r\nin a free country. However that may be, there is no doubt that,\r\nbesides having no colonies, the intermediate link of a peaceful\r\nshipping, and the interests involved in it, are now likewise lacking.\r\nIn short, the United States has only one link of the three.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of naval war have changed so much within the last\r\nhundred years, that it may be doubted whether such disastrous effects\r\non the one hand, or such brilliant prosperity on the other, as were\r\nseen in the wars between England and France, could now recur. In her\r\nsecure and haughty sway of the seas England imposed a yoke on neutrals\r\nwhich will never again be borne; and the principle that the flag\r\ncovers the goods is forever secured. The commerce of a belligerent can\r\ntherefore now be safely carried on in neutral ships, except when\r\ncontraband of war or to blockaded ports; and as regards the latter, it\r\nis also certain that there will be no more paper blockades. Putting\r\naside therefore the question of defending her seaports from capture or\r\ncontribution, as to which there is practical unanimity in theory and\r\nentire indifference in practice, what need has the United States of\r\nsea power? Her commerce is even now carried on by others; why should\r\nher people desire that which, if possessed, must be defended at great\r\ncost? So far as this question is economical, it is outside the scope\r\nof this work; but conditions which may entail suffering and loss on\r\nthe country by war are directly pertinent to it. Granting therefore\r\nthat the foreign trade of the United States, going and coming, is on\r\nboard ships which an enemy cannot touch except when bound to a\r\nblockaded port, what will constitute an efficient blockade? The\r\npresent definition is, that it is such as to constitute a manifest\r\ndanger to a vessel seeking to enter or leave the port. This is\r\nevidently very elastic. Many can remember that during the Civil War,\r\nafter a night attack on the United States fleet off Charleston, the\r\nConfederates next morning sent out a steamer with some foreign consuls\r\non board, who so far satisfied themselves that no blockading vessel\r\nwas in sight that they issued a declaration to that effect. On the\r\nstrength of this declaration some Southern authorities claimed that\r\nthe blockade was technically broken, and could not be technically\r\nre-established without a new notification. Is it necessary, to\r\nconstitute a real danger to blockade-runners, that the blockading\r\nfleet should be in sight? Half a dozen fast steamers, cruising twenty\r\nmiles off-shore between the New Jersey and Long Island coast, would be\r\na very real danger to ships seeking to go in or out by the principal\r\nentrance to New York; and similar positions might effectively blockade\r\nBoston, the Delaware, and the Chesapeake. The main body of the\r\nblockading fleet, prepared not only to capture merchant-ships but to\r\nresist military attempts to break the blockade, need not be within\r\nsight, nor in a position known to the shore. The bulk of Nelson's\r\nfleet was fifty miles from Cadiz two days before Trafalgar, with a\r\nsmall detachment watching close to the harbor. The allied fleet began\r\nto get under way at 7 A.M., and Nelson, even under the conditions of\r\nthose days, knew it by 9.30. The English fleet at that distance was a\r\nvery real danger to its enemy. It seems possible, in these days of\r\nsubmarine telegraphs, that the blockading forces in-shore and\r\noff-shore, and from one port to another, might be in telegraphic\r\ncommunication with one another along the whole coast of the United\r\nStates, readily giving mutual support; and if, by some fortunate\r\nmilitary combination, one detachment were attacked in force, it could\r\nwarn the others and retreat upon them. Granting that such a blockade\r\noff one port were broken on one day, by fairly driving away the ships\r\nmaintaining it, the notification of its being re-established could be\r\ncabled all over the world the next. To avoid such blockades there must\r\nbe a military force afloat that will at all times so endanger a\r\nblockading fleet that it can by no means keep its place. Then neutral\r\nships, except those laden with contraband of war, can come and go\r\nfreely, and maintain the commercial relations of the country with the\r\nworld outside.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that, with the extensive sea-coast of the United\r\nStates, a blockade of the whole line cannot be effectively kept up. No\r\none will more readily concede this than officers who remember how the\r\nblockade of the Southern coast alone was maintained. But in the\r\npresent condition of the navy, and, it may be added, with any\r\nadditions not exceeding those so far proposed by the government,[14]\r\nthe attempt to blockade Boston, New York, the Delaware, the\r\nChesapeake, and the Mississippi, in other words, the great centres of\r\nexport and import, would not entail upon one of the large maritime\r\nnations efforts greater than have been made before. England has at the\r\nsame time blockaded Brest, the Biscay coast, Toulon, and Cadiz, when\r\nthere were powerful squadrons lying within the harbors. It is true\r\nthat commerce in neutral ships can then enter other ports of the\r\nUnited States than those named; but what a dislocation of the carrying\r\ntraffic of the country, what failure of supplies at times, what\r\ninadequate means of transport by rail or water, of dockage, of\r\nlighterage, of warehousing, will be involved in such an enforced\r\nchange of the ports of entry! Will there be no money loss, no\r\nsuffering, consequent upon this? And when with much pain and expense\r\nthese evils have been partially remedied, the enemy may be led to stop\r\nthe new inlets as he did the old. The people of the United States will\r\ncertainly not starve, but they may suffer grievously. As for supplies\r\nwhich are contraband of war, is there not reason to fear that the\r\nUnited States is not now able to go alone if an emergency should\r\narise?\r\n\r\nThe question is eminently one in which the influence of the government\r\nshould make itself felt, to build up for the nation a navy which, if\r\nnot capable of reaching distant countries, shall at least be able to\r\nkeep clear the chief approaches to its own. The eyes of the country\r\nhave for a quarter of a century been turned from the sea; the results\r\nof such a policy and of its opposite will be shown in the instance of\r\nFrance and of England. Without asserting a narrow parallelism between\r\nthe case of the United States and either of these, it may safely be\r\nsaid that it is essential to the welfare of the whole country that the\r\nconditions of trade and commerce should remain, as far as possible,\r\nunaffected by an external war. In order to do this, the enemy must be\r\nkept not only out of our ports, but far away from our coasts.[15]\r\n\r\nCan this navy be had without restoring the merchant shipping? It is\r\ndoubtful. History has proved that such a purely military sea power can\r\nbe built up by a despot, as was done by Louis XIV.; but though so fair\r\nseeming, experience showed that his navy was like a growth which\r\nhaving no root soon withers away. But in a representative government\r\nany military expenditure must have a strongly represented interest\r\nbehind it, convinced of its necessity. Such an interest in sea power\r\ndoes not exist, cannot exist here without action by the government.\r\nHow such a merchant shipping should be built up, whether by subsidies\r\nor by free trade, by constant administration of tonics or by free\r\nmovement in the open air, is not a military but an economical\r\nquestion. Even had the United States a great national shipping, it may\r\nbe doubted whether a sufficient navy would follow; the distance which\r\nseparates her from other great powers, in one way a protection, is\r\nalso a snare. The motive, if any there be, which will give the United\r\nStates a navy, is probably now quickening in the Central American\r\nIsthmus. Let us hope it will not come to the birth too late.\r\n\r\nHere concludes the general discussion of the principal elements which\r\naffect, favorably or unfavorably, the growth of sea power in nations.\r\nThe aim has been, first to consider those elements in their natural\r\ntendency for or against, and then to illustrate by particular examples\r\nand by the experience of the past. Such discussions, while undoubtedly\r\nembracing a wider field, yet fall mainly within the province of\r\nstrategy, as distinguished from tactics. The considerations and\r\nprinciples which enter into them belong to the unchangeable, or\r\nunchanging, order of things, remaining the same, in cause and effect,\r\nfrom age to age. They belong, as it were, to the Order of Nature, of\r\nwhose stability so much is heard in our day; whereas tactics, using as\r\nits instruments the weapons made by man, shares in the change and\r\nprogress of the race from generation to generation. From time to time\r\nthe superstructure of tactics has to be altered or wholly torn down;\r\nbut the old foundations of strategy so far remain, as though laid upon\r\na rock. There will next be examined the general history of Europe and\r\nAmerica, with particular reference to the effect exercised upon that\r\nhistory, and upon the welfare of the people, by sea power in its broad\r\nsense. From time to time, as occasion offers, the aim will be to\r\nrecall and reinforce the general teaching, already elicited, by\r\nparticular illustrations. The general tenor of the study will\r\ntherefore be strategical, in that broad definition of naval strategy\r\nwhich has before been quoted and accepted: \"Naval strategy has for its\r\nend to found, support, and increase, as well in peace as in war, the\r\nsea power of a country.\" In the matter of particular battles, while\r\nfreely admitting that the change of details has made obsolete much of\r\ntheir teaching, the attempt will be made to point out where the\r\napplication or neglect of true general principles has produced\r\ndecisive effects; and, other things being equal, those actions will be\r\npreferred which, from their association with the names of the most\r\ndistinguished officers, may be presumed to show how far just tactical\r\nideas obtained in a particular age or a particular service. It will\r\nalso be desirable, where analogies between ancient and modern weapons\r\nappear on the surface, to derive such probable lessons as they offer,\r\nwithout laying undue stress upon the points of resemblance. Finally,\r\nit must be remembered that, among all changes, the nature of man\r\nremains much the same; the personal equation, though uncertain in\r\nquantity and quality in the particular instance, is sure always to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] By a base of permanent operations \"is understood a country whence\r\ncome all the resources, where are united the great lines of\r\ncommunication by land and water, where are the arsenals and armed\r\nposts.\"\r\n\r\n[8] An interesting proof of the weight attributed to the naval power\r\nof Great Britain by a great military authority will be found in the\r\nopening chapter of Jomini's \"History of the Wars of the French\r\nRevolution.\" He lays down, as a fundamental principle of European\r\npolicy, that an unlimited expansion of naval force should not be\r\npermitted to any nation which cannot be approached by land,--a\r\ndescription which can apply only to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[9] Gougeard: La Marine de Guerre; Richelieu et Colbert.\r\n\r\n[10] Whatever may be thought of Clerk's claim to originality in\r\nconstructing a system of naval tactics, and it has been seriously\r\nimpugned, there can be no doubt that his criticisms on the past were\r\nsound. So far as the author knows, he in this respect deserves credit\r\nfor an originality remarkable in one who had the training neither of a\r\nseaman nor of a military man.\r\n\r\n[11] La Serre: Essais Hist. et Crit. sur la Marine Française.\r\n\r\n[12] Lapeyrouse-Bonfils: Hist. de la Marine Française.\r\n\r\n[13] Jurien de la Gravière: Guerres Maritimes.\r\n\r\n[14] Since the above was written, the secretary of the navy, in his\r\nreport for 1889, has recommended a fleet which would make such a\r\nblockade as here suggested very hazardous.\r\n\r\n[15] The word \"defence\" in war involves two ideas, which for the sake\r\nof precision in thought should be kept separated in the mind. There is\r\ndefence pure and simple, which strengthens itself and awaits attack.\r\nThis may be called passive defence. On the other hand, there is a view\r\nof defence which asserts that safety for one's self, the real object\r\nof defensive preparation, is best secured by attacking the enemy. In\r\nthe matter of sea-coast defence, the former method is exemplified by\r\nstationary fortifications, submarine mines, and generally all immobile\r\nworks destined simply to stop an enemy if he tries to enter. The\r\nsecond method comprises all those means and weapons which do not wait\r\nfor attack, but go to meet the enemy's fleet, whether it be but for a\r\nfew miles, or whether to his own shores. Such a defence may seem to be\r\nreally offensive war, but it is not; it becomes offensive only when\r\nits object of attack is changed from the enemy's fleet to the enemy's\r\ncountry. England defended her own coasts and colonies by stationing\r\nher fleets off the French ports, to fight the French fleet if it came\r\nout. The United States in the Civil War stationed her fleets off the\r\nSouthern ports, not because she feared for her own, but to break down\r\nthe Confederacy by isolation from the rest of the world, and\r\nultimately by attacking the ports. The methods were the same; but the\r\npurpose in one case was defensive, in the other offensive.\r\n\r\nThe confusion of the two ideas leads to much unnecessary wrangling as\r\nto the proper sphere of army and navy in coast-defence. Passive\r\ndefences belong to the army; everything that moves in the water to the\r\nnavy, which has the prerogative of the offensive defence. If seamen\r\nare used to garrison forts, they become part of the land forces, as\r\nsurely as troops, when embarked as part of the complement, become part\r\nof the sea forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    STATE OF EUROPE IN 1660.--SECOND ANGLO-DUTCH WAR, 1665-1667. SEA\r\n    BATTLES OF LOWESTOFT AND OF THE FOUR DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period at which our historical survey is to begin has been loosely\r\nstated as the middle of the seventeenth century. The year 1660 will\r\nnow be taken as the definite date at which to open. In May of that\r\nyear Charles II. was restored to the English throne amid the general\r\nrejoicing of the people. In March of the following year, upon the\r\ndeath of Cardinal Mazarin, Louis XIV. assembled his ministers and said\r\nto them: \"I have summoned you to tell you that it has pleased me\r\nhitherto to permit my affairs to be governed by the late cardinal; I\r\nshall in future be my own prime minister. I direct that no decree be\r\nsealed except by my orders, and I order the secretaries of State and\r\nthe superintendent of the finances to sign nothing without my\r\ncommand.\" The personal government thus assumed was maintained, in fact\r\nas well as in name, for over half a century.\r\n\r\nWithin one twelvemonth then are seen, setting forward upon a new stage\r\nof national life, after a period of confusion more or less prolonged,\r\nthe two States which, amid whatever inequalities, have had the first\r\nplaces in the sea history of modern Europe and America, indeed, of the\r\nworld at large. Sea history, however, is but one factor in that\r\ngeneral advance and decay of nations which is called their history;\r\nand if sight be lost of the other factors to which it is so closely\r\nrelated, a distorted view, either exaggerated or the reverse, of its\r\nimportance will be formed. It is with the belief that that importance\r\nis vastly underrated, if not practically lost sight of, by people\r\nunconnected with the sea, and particularly by the people of the United\r\nStates in our own day, that this study has been undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe date taken, 1660, followed closely another which marked a great\r\nsettlement of European affairs, setting the seal of treaty upon the\r\nresults of a general war, known to history as the Thirty Years' War.\r\nThis other date was that of the Treaty of Westphalia, or Munster, in\r\n1648. In this the independence of the Dutch United Provinces, long\r\nbefore practically assured, was formally acknowledged by Spain; and it\r\nbeing followed in 1659 by the Treaty of the Pyrenees between France\r\nand Spain, the two gave to Europe a state of general external peace,\r\ndestined soon to be followed by a series of almost universal wars,\r\nwhich lasted as long as Louis XIV. lived,--wars which were to induce\r\nprofound changes in the map of Europe; during which new States were to\r\narise, others to decay, and all to undergo large modifications, either\r\nin extent of dominion or in political power. In these results maritime\r\npower, directly or indirectly, had a great share.\r\n\r\nWe must first look at the general condition of European States at the\r\ntime from which the narrative starts. In the struggles, extending over\r\nnearly a century, whose end is marked by the Peace of Westphalia, the\r\nroyal family known as the House of Austria had been the great\r\noverwhelming power which all others feared. During the long reign of\r\nthe Emperor Charles V., who abdicated a century before, the head of\r\nthat house had united in his own person the two crowns of Austria and\r\nSpain, which carried with them, among other possessions, the countries\r\nwe now know as Holland and Belgium, together with a preponderating\r\ninfluence in Italy. After his abdication the two great monarchies of\r\nAustria and Spain were separated; but though ruled by different\r\npersons, they were still in the same family, and tended toward that\r\nunity of aim and sympathy which marked dynastic connections in that\r\nand the following century. To this bond of union was added that of a\r\ncommon religion. During the century before the Peace of Westphalia,\r\nthe extension of family power, and the extension of the religion\r\nprofessed, were the two strongest motives of political action. This\r\nwas the period of the great religious wars which arrayed nation\r\nagainst nation, principality against principality, and often, in the\r\nsame nation, faction against faction. Religious persecution caused the\r\nrevolt of the Protestant Dutch Provinces against Spain, which issued,\r\nafter eighty years of more or less constant war, in the recognition of\r\ntheir independence. Religious discord, amounting to civil war at\r\ntimes, distracted France during the greater part of the same period,\r\nprofoundly affecting not only her internal but her external policy.\r\nThese were the days of St. Bartholomew, of the religious murder of\r\nHenry IV., of the siege of La Rochelle, of constant intriguing between\r\nRoman Catholic Spain and Roman Catholic Frenchmen. As the religious\r\nmotive, acting in a sphere to which it did not naturally belong, and\r\nin which it had no rightful place, died away, the political\r\nnecessities and interests of States began to have juster weight; not\r\nthat they had been wholly lost sight of in the mean time, but the\r\nreligious animosities had either blinded the eyes, or fettered the\r\naction, of statesmen. It was natural that in France, one of the\r\ngreatest sufferers from religious passions, owing to the number and\r\ncharacter of the Protestant minority, this reaction should first and\r\nmost markedly be seen. Placed between Spain and the German States,\r\namong which Austria stood foremost without a rival, internal union and\r\nchecks upon the power of the House of Austria were necessities of\r\npolitical existence. Happily, Providence raised up to her in close\r\nsuccession two great rulers, Henry IV. and Richelieu,--men in whom\r\nreligion fell short of bigotry, and who, when forced to recognize it\r\nin the sphere of politics, did so as masters and not as slaves. Under\r\nthem French statesmanship received a guidance, which Richelieu\r\nformulated as a tradition, and which moved on the following general\r\nlines,--(1) Internal union of the kingdom, appeasing or putting down\r\nreligious strife and centralizing authority in the king; (2)\r\nResistance to the power of the House of Austria, which actually and\r\nnecessarily carried with it alliance with Protestant German States and\r\nwith Holland; (3) Extension of the boundaries of France to the\r\neastward, at the expense mainly of Spain, which then possessed not\r\nonly the present Belgium, but other provinces long since incorporated\r\nwith France; and (4) The creation and development of a great sea\r\npower, adding to the wealth of the kingdom, and intended specially to\r\nmake head against France's hereditary enemy, England; for which end\r\nagain the alliance with Holland was to be kept in view. Such were the\r\nbroad outlines of policy laid down by statesmen in the front rank of\r\ngenius for the guidance of that country whose people have, not without\r\ncause, claimed to be the most complete exponent of European\r\ncivilization, foremost in the march of progress, combining political\r\nadvance with individual development. This tradition, carried on by\r\nMazarin, was received from him by Louis XIV.; it will be seen how far\r\nhe was faithful to it, and what were the results to France of his\r\naction. Meanwhile it may be noted that of these four elements\r\nnecessary to the greatness of France, sea power was one; and as the\r\nsecond and third were practically one in the means employed, it may be\r\nsaid that sea power was one of the two great means by which France's\r\n_external_ greatness was to be maintained. England on the sea, Austria\r\non the land, indicated the direction that French effort was to take.\r\n\r\nAs regards the condition of France in 1660, and her readiness to move\r\nonward in the road marked by Richelieu, it may be said that internal\r\npeace was secured, the power of the nobles wholly broken, religious\r\ndiscords at rest; the tolerant edict of Nantes was still in force,\r\nwhile the remaining Protestant discontent had been put down by the\r\narmed hand. All power was absolutely centred in the throne. In other\r\nrespects, though the kingdom was at peace, the condition was less\r\nsatisfactory. There was practically no navy; commerce, internal and\r\nexternal, was not prosperous; the finances were in disorder; the army\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nSpain, the nation before which all others had trembled less than a\r\ncentury before, was now long in decay and scarcely formidable; the\r\ncentral weakness had spread to all parts of the administration. In\r\nextent of territory, however, she was still great. The Spanish\r\nNetherlands still belonged to her; she held Naples, Sicily, and\r\nSardinia; Gibraltar had not yet fallen into English hands; her vast\r\npossessions in America--with the exception of Jamaica, conquered by\r\nEngland a few years before--were still untouched. The condition of her\r\nsea power, both for peace and war, has been already alluded to. Many\r\nyears before, Richelieu had contracted a temporary alliance with\r\nSpain, by virtue of which she placed forty ships at his disposal; but\r\nthe bad condition of the vessels, for the most part ill armed and ill\r\ncommanded, compelled their withdrawal. The navy of Spain was then in\r\nfull decay, and its weakness did not escape the piercing eye of the\r\ncardinal. An encounter which took place between the Spanish and Dutch\r\nfleets in 1639 shows most plainly the state of degradation into which\r\nthis once proud navy had fallen.\r\n\r\n    \"Her navy at this time,\" says the narrative quoted, \"met one of\r\n    those shocks, a succession of which during this war degraded her\r\n    from her high station of mistress of the seas in both\r\n    hemispheres, to a contemptible rank among maritime powers. The\r\n    king was fitting out a powerful fleet to carry the war to the\r\n    coasts of Sweden, and for its equipment had commanded a\r\n    reinforcement of men and provisions to be sent from Dunkirk. A\r\n    fleet accordingly set sail, but were attacked by Von Tromp, some\r\n    captured, the remainder forced to retire within the harbor\r\n    again. Soon after, Tromp seized three English [neutral] ships\r\n    carrying 1070 Spanish soldiers from Cadiz to Dunkirk; he took\r\n    the troops out, but let the ships go free. Leaving seventeen\r\n    vessels to blockade Dunkirk, Tromp with the remaining twelve\r\n    advanced to meet the enemy's fleet on its arrival. It was soon\r\n    seen entering the Straits of Dover to the number of sixty-seven\r\n    sail, and having two thousand troops. Being joined by De Witt\r\n    with four more ships, Tromp with his small force made a resolute\r\n    attack upon the enemy. The fight lasted till four P.M., when the\r\n    Spanish admiral took refuge in the Downs. Tromp determined to\r\n    engage if they should come out; but Oquendo with his powerful\r\n    fleet, many of which carried from sixty to a hundred guns,\r\n    suffered himself to be blockaded; and the English admiral told\r\n    Tromp he was ordered to join the Spaniards if hostilities began.\r\n    Tromp sent home for instructions, and the action of England only\r\n    served to call out the vast maritime powers of the Dutch. Tromp\r\n    was rapidly reinforced to ninety-six sail and twelve fire-ships,\r\n    and ordered to attack. Leaving a detached squadron to observe\r\n    the English, and to attack them if they helped the Spaniards, he\r\n    began the fight embarrassed by a thick fog, under cover of which\r\n    the Spaniards cut their cables to escape. Many running too close\r\n    to shore went aground, and most of the remainder attempting to\r\n    retreat were sunk, captured, or driven on the French coast.\r\n    Never was victory more complete.\"[16]\r\n\r\nWhen a navy submits to such a line of action, all tone and pride must\r\nhave departed; but the navy only shared in the general decline which\r\nmade Spain henceforward have an ever lessening weight in the policy of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n    \"In the midst of the splendors of her court and language,\" says\r\n    Guizot, \"the Spanish government felt itself weak, and sought to\r\n    hide its weakness under its immobility. Philip IV. and his\r\n    minister, weary of striving only to be conquered, looked but for\r\n    the security of peace, and only sought to put aside all\r\n    questions which would call for efforts of which they felt\r\n    themselves incapable. Divided and enervated, the house of\r\n    Austria had even less ambition than power, and except when\r\n    absolutely forced, a pompous inertia became the policy of the\r\n    successors of Charles V.\"[17]\r\n\r\nSuch was the Spain of that day. That part of the Spanish dominions\r\nwhich was then known as the Low Countries, or the Roman Catholic\r\nNetherlands (our modern Belgium), was about to be a fruitful source of\r\nvariance between France and her natural ally, the Dutch Republic. This\r\nState, whose political name was the United Provinces, had now reached\r\nthe summit of its influence and power,--a power based, as has already\r\nbeen explained, wholly upon the sea, and upon the use of that element\r\nmade by the great maritime and commercial genius of the Dutch people.\r\nA recent French author thus describes the commercial and colonial\r\nconditions, at the accession of Louis XIV., of this people, which\r\nbeyond any other in modern times, save only England, has shown how the\r\nharvest of the sea can lift up to wealth and power a country\r\nintrinsically weak and without resources:--\r\n\r\n    \"Holland had become the Phoenicia of modern times. Mistresses of\r\n    the Scheldt, the United Provinces closed the outlets of Antwerp\r\n    to the sea, and inherited the commercial power of that rich\r\n    city, which an ambassador of Venice in the fifteenth century had\r\n    compared to Venice herself. They received besides in their\r\n    principal cities the workingmen of the Low Countries who fled\r\n    from Spanish tyranny of conscience. The manufactures of clothes,\r\n    linen stuffs, etc., which employed six hundred thousand souls,\r\n    opened new sources of gain to a people previously content with\r\n    the trade in cheese and fish. Fisheries alone had already\r\n    enriched them. The herring fishery supported nearly one fifth of\r\n    the population of Holland, producing three hundred thousand tons\r\n    of salt-fish, and bringing in more than eight million francs\r\n    annually.\r\n\r\n    \"The naval and commercial power of the republic developed\r\n    rapidly. The merchant fleet of Holland alone numbered 10,000\r\n    sail, 168,000 seamen, and supported 260,000 inhabitants. She had\r\n    taken possession of the greater part of the European\r\n    carrying-trade, and had added thereto, since the peace, all the\r\n    carriage of merchandise between America and Spain, did the same\r\n    service for the French ports, and maintained an importation\r\n    traffic of thirty-six million francs. The north countries,\r\n    Brandenburg, Denmark, Sweden, Muscovy, Poland, access to which\r\n    was opened by the Baltic to the Provinces, were for them an\r\n    inexhaustible market of exchange. They fed it by the produce\r\n    they sold there, and by purchase of the products of the\r\n    North,--wheat, timber, copper, hemp, and furs. The total value\r\n    of merchandise yearly shipped in Dutch bottoms, in all seas,\r\n    exceeded a thousand million francs. The Dutch had made\r\n    themselves, to use a contemporary phrase, the wagoners of all\r\n    seas.\"[18]\r\n\r\nIt was through its colonies that the republic had been able thus to\r\ndevelop its sea trade. It had the monopoly of all the products of the\r\nEast. Produce and spices from Asia were by her brought to Europe of a\r\nyearly value of sixteen million francs. The powerful East India\r\nCompany, founded in 1602, had built up in Asia an empire, with\r\npossessions taken from the Portuguese. Mistress in 1650 of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, which guaranteed it a stopping-place for its ships, it\r\nreigned as a sovereign in Ceylon, and upon the coasts of Malabar and\r\nCoromandel. It had made Batavia its seat of government, and extended\r\nits traffic to China and Japan. Meanwhile the West India Company, of\r\nmore rapid rise, but less durable, had manned eight hundred ships of\r\nwar and trade. It had used them to seize the remnants of Portuguese\r\npower upon the shores of Guinea, as well as in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe United Provinces had thus become the warehouse wherein were\r\ncollected the products of all nations.\r\n\r\nThe colonies of the Dutch at this time were scattered throughout the\r\neastern seas, in India, in Malacca, in Java, the Moluccas, and various\r\nparts of the vast archipelago lying to the northward of Australia.\r\nThey had possessions on the west coast of Africa, and as yet the\r\ncolony of New Amsterdam remained in their hands. In South America the\r\nDutch West India Company had owned nearly three hundred leagues of\r\ncoast from Bahia in Brazil northward; but much had recently escaped\r\nfrom their hands.\r\n\r\nThe United Provinces owed their consideration and power to their\r\nwealth and their fleets. The sea, which beats like an inveterate enemy\r\nagainst their shores, had been subdued and made a useful servant; the\r\nland was to prove their destruction. A long and fierce strife had been\r\nmaintained with an enemy more cruel than the sea,--the Spanish\r\nkingdom; the successful ending, with its delusive promise of rest and\r\npeace, but sounded the knell of the Dutch Republic. So long as the\r\npower of Spain remained unimpaired, or at least great enough to keep\r\nup the terror that she had long inspired, it was to the interest of\r\nEngland and of France, both sufferers from Spanish menace and\r\nintrigue, that the United Provinces should be strong and independent.\r\nWhen Spain fell,--and repeated humiliations showed that her weakness\r\nwas real and not seeming,--other motives took the place of fear.\r\nEngland coveted Holland's trade and sea dominion; France desired the\r\nSpanish Netherlands. The United Provinces had reason to oppose the\r\nlatter as well as the former.\r\n\r\nUnder the combined assaults of the two rival nations, the intrinsic\r\nweakness of the United Provinces was soon to be felt and seen. Open to\r\nattack by the land, few in numbers, and with a government ill adapted\r\nto put forth the united strength of a people, above all unfitted to\r\nkeep up adequate preparation for war, the decline of the republic and\r\nthe nation was to be more striking and rapid than the rise. As yet,\r\nhowever, in 1660, no indications of the coming fall were remarked. The\r\nrepublic was still in the front rank of the great powers of Europe.\r\nIf, in 1654, the war with England had shown a state of unreadiness\r\nwonderful in a navy that had so long humbled the pride of Spain on the\r\nseas, on the other hand the Provinces, in 1657, had effectually put a\r\nstop to the insults of France directed against her commerce; and a\r\nyear later, \"by their interference in the Baltic between Denmark and\r\nSweden, they had hindered Sweden from establishing in the North a\r\npreponderance disastrous to them. They forced her to leave open the\r\nentrance to the Baltic, of which they remained masters, no other navy\r\nbeing able to dispute its control with them. The superiority of their\r\nfleet, the valor of their troops, the skill and firmness of their\r\ndiplomacy, had caused the prestige of their government to be\r\nrecognized. Weakened and humiliated by the last English war, they had\r\nreplaced themselves in the rank of great powers. At this moment\r\nCharles II. was restored.\"\r\n\r\nThe general character of the government has been before mentioned, and\r\nneed here only be recalled. It was a loosely knit confederacy,\r\nadministered by what may not inaccurately be called a commercial\r\naristocracy, with all the political timidity of that class, which has\r\nso much to risk in war. The effect of these two factors, sectional\r\njealousy and commercial spirit, upon the military navy was disastrous.\r\nIt was not kept up properly in peace, there were necessarily rivalries\r\nin a fleet which was rather a maritime coalition than a united navy,\r\nand there was too little of a true military spirit among the officers.\r\nA more heroic people than the Dutch never existed; the annals of Dutch\r\nsea-fights give instances of desperate enterprise and endurance\r\ncertainly not excelled, perhaps never equalled, elsewhere; but they\r\nalso exhibit instances of defection and misconduct which show a lack\r\nof military spirit, due evidently to lack of professional pride and\r\ntraining. This professional training scarcely existed in any navy of\r\nthat day, but its place was largely supplied in monarchical countries\r\nby the feeling of a military caste. It remains to be noted that the\r\ngovernment, weak enough from the causes named, was yet weaker from the\r\ndivision of the people into two great factions bitterly hating each\r\nother. The one, which was the party of the merchants (burgomasters),\r\nand now in power, favored the confederate republic as described; the\r\nother desired a monarchical government under the House of Orange. The\r\nRepublican party wished for a French alliance, if possible, and a\r\nstrong navy; the Orange party favored England, to whose royal house\r\nthe Prince of Orange was closely related, and a powerful army. Under\r\nthese conditions of government, and weak in numbers, the United\r\nProvinces in 1660, with their vast wealth and external activities,\r\nresembled a man kept up by stimulants. Factitious strength cannot\r\nendure indefinitely; but it is wonderful to see this small State,\r\nweaker by far in numbers than either England or France, endure the\r\nonslaught of either singly, and for two years of both in alliance, not\r\nonly without being destroyed, but without losing her place in Europe.\r\nShe owed this astonishing result partly to the skill of one or two\r\nmen, but mainly to her sea power.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of England, with reference to her fitness to enter upon\r\nthe impending strife, differed from those of both Holland and France.\r\nAlthough monarchical in government, and with much real power in the\r\nking's hands, the latter was not able to direct the policy of the\r\nkingdom wholly at his will. He had to reckon, as Louis had not, with\r\nthe temper and wishes of his people. What Louis gained for France, he\r\ngained for himself; the glory of France was his glory. Charles aimed\r\nfirst at his own advantage, then at that of England; but, with the\r\nmemory of the past ever before him, he was determined above all not to\r\nincur his father's fate nor a repetition of his own exile. Therefore,\r\nwhen danger became imminent, he gave way before the feeling of the\r\nEnglish nation. Charles himself hated Holland; he hated it as a\r\nrepublic; he hated the existing government because opposed in internal\r\naffairs to his connections, the House of Orange; and he hated it yet\r\nmore because in the days of his exile, the republic, as one of the\r\nconditions of peace with Cromwell, had driven him from her borders. He\r\nwas drawn to France by the political sympathy of a would-be absolute\r\nruler, possibly by his Roman Catholic bias, and very largely by the\r\nmoney paid him by Louis, which partially freed him from the control of\r\nParliament. In following these tendencies of his own, Charles had to\r\ntake account of certain decided wishes of his people. The English, of\r\nthe same race as the Dutch, and with similar conditions of situation,\r\nwere declared rivals for the control of the sea and of commerce; and\r\nas the Dutch were now leading in the race, the English were the more\r\neager and bitter. A special cause of grievance was found in the action\r\nof the Dutch East India Company, \"which claimed the monopoly of trade\r\nin the East, and had obliged distant princes with whom it treated to\r\nclose their States to foreign nations, who were thus excluded, not\r\nonly from the Dutch colonies, but from all the territory of the\r\nIndies.\" Conscious of greater strength, the English also wished to\r\ncontrol the action of Dutch politics, and in the days of the English\r\nRepublic had even sought to impose a union of the two governments. At\r\nthe first, therefore, popular rivalry and enmity seconded the king's\r\nwishes; the more so as France had not for some years been formidable\r\non the continent. As soon, however, as the aggressive policy of Louis\r\nXIV. was generally recognized, the English people, both nobles and\r\ncommons, felt the great danger to be there, as a century before it had\r\nbeen in Spain. The transfer of the Spanish Netherlands (Belgium) to\r\nFrance would tend toward the subjection of Europe, and especially\r\nwould be a blow to the sea power both of the Dutch and English; for it\r\nwas not to be supposed that Louis would allow the Scheldt and port of\r\nAntwerp to remain closed, as they then were, under a treaty wrung by\r\nthe Dutch from the weakness of Spain. The reopening to commerce of\r\nthat great city would be a blow alike to Amsterdam and to London. With\r\nthe revival of inherited opposition to France the ties of kindred\r\nbegan to tell; the memory of past alliance against the tyranny of\r\nSpain was recalled; and similarity of religious faith, still a\r\npowerful motive, drew the two together. At the same time the great and\r\nsystematic efforts of Colbert to build up the commerce and the navy of\r\nFrance excited the jealousy of both the sea powers; rivals themselves,\r\nthey instinctively turned against a third party intruding upon their\r\ndomain. Charles was unable to resist the pressure of his people under\r\nall these motives; wars between England and Holland ceased, and were\r\nfollowed, after Charles's death, by close alliance.\r\n\r\nAlthough her commerce was less extensive, the navy of England in 1660\r\nwas superior to that of Holland, particularly in organization and\r\nefficiency. The stern, enthusiastic religious government of Cromwell,\r\ngrounded on military strength, had made its mark both on the fleet and\r\narmy. The names of several of the superior officers under the\r\nProtector, among which that of Monk stands foremost, appear in the\r\nnarrative of the first of the Dutch wars under Charles. This\r\nsuperiority in tone and discipline gradually disappeared under the\r\ncorrupting influence of court favor in a licentious government; and\r\nHolland, which upon the whole was worsted by England alone upon the\r\nsea in 1665, successfully resisted the combined navies of England and\r\nFrance in 1672. As regards the material of the three fleets, we are\r\ntold that the French ships had greater displacement than the English\r\nrelatively to the weight of artillery and stores; hence they could\r\nkeep, when fully loaded, a greater height of battery. Their hulls also\r\nhad better lines. These advantages would naturally follow from the\r\nthoughtful and systematic way in which the French navy at that time\r\nwas restored from a state of decay, and has a lesson of hope for us in\r\nthe present analogous condition of our own navy. The Dutch ships, from\r\nthe character of their coast, were flatter-bottomed and of less\r\ndraught, and thus were able, when pressed, to find a refuge among the\r\nshoals; but they were in consequence less weatherly and generally of\r\nlighter scantling than those of either of the other nations.\r\n\r\nThus as briefly as possible have been sketched the conditions, degree\r\nof power, and aims which shaped and controlled the policy of the four\r\nprincipal seaboard States of the day,--Spain, France, England, and\r\nHolland. From the point of view of this history, these will come most\r\nprominently and most often into notice; but as other States exercised\r\na powerful influence upon the course of events, and our aim is not\r\nmerely naval history but an appreciation of the effect of naval and\r\ncommercial power upon the course of general history, it is necessary\r\nto state shortly the condition of the rest of Europe. America had not\r\nyet begun to play a prominent part in the pages of history or in the\r\npolicies of cabinets.\r\n\r\nGermany was then divided into many small governments, with the one\r\ngreat empire of Austria. The policy of the smaller States shifted, and\r\nit was the aim of France to combine as many of them as possible under\r\nher influence, in pursuance of her traditional opposition to Austria.\r\nWith France thus working against her on the one side, Austria was in\r\nimminent peril on the other from the constant assaults of the Turkish\r\nEmpire, still vigorous though decaying. The policy of France had long\r\ninclined to friendly relations with Turkey, not only as a check upon\r\nAustria, but also from her wish to engross the trade with the Levant.\r\nColbert, in his extreme eagerness for the sea power of France, favored\r\nthis alliance. It will be remembered that Greece and Egypt were then\r\nparts of the Turkish Empire.\r\n\r\nPrussia as now known did not exist. The foundations of the future\r\nkingdom were then being prepared by the Elector of Brandenburg, a\r\npowerful minor State, which was not yet able to stand quite alone, but\r\ncarefully avoided a formally dependent position. The kingdom of Poland\r\nstill existed, a most disturbing and important factor in European\r\npolitics, because of its weak and unsettled government, which kept\r\nevery other State anxious lest some unforeseen turn of events there\r\nshould tend to the advantage of a rival. It was the traditional policy\r\nof France to keep Poland upright and strong. Russia was still below\r\nthe horizon; coming, but not yet come, within the circle of European\r\nStates and their living interests. She and the other powers bordering\r\nupon the Baltic were naturally rivals for preponderance in that sea,\r\nin which the other States, and above all the maritime States, had a\r\nparticular interest as the source from which naval stores of every\r\nkind were chiefly drawn. Sweden and Denmark were at this time in a\r\nstate of constant enmity, and were to be found on opposite sides in\r\nthe quarrels that prevailed. For many years past, and during the early\r\nwars of Louis XIV., Sweden was for the most part in alliance with\r\nFrance; her bias was that way.\r\n\r\nThe general state of Europe being as described, the spring that was to\r\nset the various wheels in motion was in the hands of Louis XIV. The\r\nweakness of his immediate neighbors, the great resources of his\r\nkingdom, only waiting for development, the unity of direction\r\nresulting from his absolute power, his own practical talent and\r\nuntiring industry, aided during the first half of his reign by a\r\ncombination of ministers of singular ability, all united to make every\r\ngovernment in Europe hang more or less upon his action, and be\r\ndetermined by, if not follow, his lead. The greatness of France was\r\nhis object, and he had the choice of advancing it by either of two\r\nroads,--by the land or by the sea; not that the one wholly forbade the\r\nother, but that France, overwhelmingly strong as she then was, had not\r\npower to move with equal steps on both paths.\r\n\r\nLouis chose extension by land. He had married the eldest daughter of\r\nPhilip IV., the then reigning king of Spain; and though by the treaty\r\nof marriage she had renounced all claim to her father's inheritance,\r\nit was not difficult to find reasons for disregarding this\r\nstipulation. Technical grounds were found for setting it aside as\r\nregarded certain portions of the Netherlands and Franche Comté, and\r\nnegotiations were entered into with the court of Spain to annul it\r\naltogether. The matter was the more important because the male heir to\r\nthe throne was so feeble that it was evident that the Austrian line of\r\nSpanish kings would end in him. The desire to put a French prince on\r\nthe Spanish throne--either himself, thus uniting the two crowns, or\r\nelse one of his family, thus putting the House of Bourbon in authority\r\non both sides of the Pyrenees--was the false light which led Louis\r\nastray during the rest of his reign, to the final destruction of the\r\nsea power of France and the impoverishment and misery of his people.\r\nLouis failed to understand that he had to reckon with all Europe. The\r\ndirect project on the Spanish throne had to wait for a vacancy; but he\r\ngot ready at once to move upon the Spanish possessions to the east of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this more effectually, he cut off from Spain every\r\npossible ally by skilful diplomatic intrigues, the study of which\r\nwould give a useful illustration of strategy in the realm of politics,\r\nbut he made two serious mistakes to the injury of the sea power of\r\nFrance. Portugal had until twenty years before been united to the\r\ncrown of Spain, and the claim to it had not been surrendered. Louis\r\nconsidered that were Spain to regain that kingdom she would be too\r\nstrong for him easily to carry out his aims. Among other means of\r\nprevention he promoted a marriage between Charles II. and the Infanta\r\nof Portugal, in consequence of which Portugal ceded to England, Bombay\r\nin India, and Tangiers in the Straits of Gibraltar, which was reputed\r\nan excellent port. We see here a French king, in his eagerness for\r\nextension by land, inviting England to the Mediterranean, and\r\nforwarding her alliance with Portugal. The latter was the more\r\ncurious, as Louis already foresaw the failure of the Spanish royal\r\nhouse, and should rather have wished the union of the peninsular\r\nkingdoms. As a matter of fact, Portugal became a dependent and outpost\r\nof England, by which she readily landed in the Peninsula down to the\r\ndays of Napoleon. Indeed, if independent of Spain, she is too weak not\r\nto be under the control of the power that rules the sea and so has\r\nreadiest access to her. Louis continued to support her against Spain,\r\nand secured her independence. He also interfered with the Dutch, and\r\ncompelled them to restore Brazil, which they had taken from the\r\nPortuguese.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Louis obtained from Charles II. the cession of\r\nDunkirk on the Channel, which had been seized and used by Cromwell.\r\nThis surrender was made for money, and was inexcusable from the\r\nmaritime point of view. Dunkirk was for the English a bridge-head into\r\nFrance. To France it became a haven for privateers, the bane of\r\nEngland's commerce in the Channel and the North Sea. As the French sea\r\npower waned, England in treaty after treaty exacted the dismantling of\r\nthe works of Dunkirk, which it may be said in passing was the home\r\nport of the celebrated Jean Bart and other great French privateersmen.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the greatest and wisest of Louis' ministers, Colbert, was\r\ndiligently building up that system of administration, which, by\r\nincreasing and solidly basing the wealth of the State, should bring a\r\nsurer greatness and prosperity than the king's more showy enterprises.\r\nWith those details that concern the internal development of the\r\nkingdom this history has no concern, beyond the incidental mention\r\nthat production, both agricultural and manufacturing, received his\r\ncareful attention; but upon the sea a policy of skilful aggression\r\nupon the shipping and commerce of the Dutch and English quickly began,\r\nand was instantly resented. Great trading companies were formed,\r\ndirecting French enterprise to the Baltic, to the Levant, to the East\r\nand West Indies; customs regulations were amended to encourage French\r\nmanufactures, and to allow goods to be stored in bond in the great\r\nports, by which means it was hoped to make France take Holland's place\r\nas the great warehouse for Europe, a function for which her\r\ngeographical position eminently fitted her; while tonnage duties on\r\nforeign shipping, direct premiums on home-built ships, and careful,\r\nrigorous colonial decrees giving French vessels the monopoly of trade\r\nto and from the colonies, combined to encourage the growth of her\r\nmercantile marine. England retaliated at once; the Dutch, more\r\nseriously threatened because their carrying-trade was greater and\r\ntheir home resources smaller, only remonstrated for a time; but after\r\nthree years they also made reprisals. Colbert, relying on the great\r\nsuperiority of France as an actual, and still more as a possible\r\nproducer, feared not to move steadily on the grasping path marked out;\r\nwhich, in building up a great merchant shipping, would lay the broad\r\nbase for the military shipping, which was being yet more rapidly\r\nforced on by the measures of the State. Prosperity grew apace. At the\r\nend of twelve years everything was flourishing, everything rich in the\r\nState, which was in utter confusion when he took charge of the\r\nfinances and marine.\r\n\r\n    \"Under him,\" says a French historian, \"France grew by peace as\r\n    she had grown by war.... The warfare of tariffs and premiums\r\n    skilfully conducted by him tended to reduce within just limits\r\n    the exorbitant growth of commercial and maritime power which\r\n    Holland had arrogated at the expense of other nations; and to\r\n    restrain England, which was burning to wrest this supremacy from\r\n    Holland in order to use it in a manner much more dangerous to\r\n    Europe. The interest of France seemed to be peace in Europe and\r\n    America; a mysterious voice, at once the voice of the past and\r\n    of the future, called for her warlike activity on other\r\n    shores.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThis voice found expression through the mouth of Leibnitz, one of the\r\nworld's great men, who pointed out to Louis that to turn the arms of\r\nFrance against Egypt would give her, in the dominion of the\r\nMediterranean and the control of Eastern trade, a victory over Holland\r\ngreater than the most successful campaign on land; and while insuring\r\na much needed peace within his kingdom, would build up a power on the\r\nsea that would insure preponderance in Europe. This memorial called\r\nLouis from the pursuit of glory on the land to seek the durable\r\ngrandeur of France in the possession of a great sea power, the\r\nelements of which, thanks to the genius of Colbert, he had in his\r\nhands. A century later a greater man than Louis sought to exalt\r\nhimself and France by the path pointed out by Leibnitz; but Napoleon\r\ndid not have, as Louis had, a navy equal to the task proposed. This\r\nproject of Leibnitz will be more fully referred to when the narrative\r\nreaches the momentous date at which it was broached; when Louis, with\r\nhis kingdom and navy in the highest pitch of efficiency, stood at the\r\npoint where the roads parted, and then took the one which settled that\r\nFrance should not be the power of the sea. This decision, which killed\r\nColbert and ruined the prosperity of France, was felt in its\r\nconsequences from generation to generation afterward, as the great\r\nnavy of England, in war after war, swept the seas, insured the growing\r\nwealth of the island kingdom through exhausting strifes, while drying\r\nup the external resources of French trade and inflicting consequent\r\nmisery. The false line of policy that began with Louis XIV. also\r\nturned France away from a promising career in India, in the days of\r\nhis successor.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: ENGLISH CHANNEL AND NORTH SEA.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two maritime States, England and Holland, though eying\r\nFrance distrustfully, had greater and growing grudges against each\r\nother, which under the fostering care of Charles II. led to war. The\r\ntrue cause was doubtless commercial jealousy, and the conflict sprang\r\nimmediately from collisions between the trading companies. Hostilities\r\nbegan on the west coast of Africa; and an English squadron, in 1664,\r\nafter subduing several Dutch stations there, sailed to New Amsterdam\r\n(now New York), and seized it. All these affairs took place before the\r\nformal declaration of war in February, 1665. This war was undoubtedly\r\npopular in England; the instinct of the people found an expression by\r\nthe lips of Monk, who is reported to have said, \"What matters this or\r\nthat reason? What we want is more of the trade which the Dutch now\r\nhave.\" There is also little room to doubt that, despite the\r\npretensions of the trading companies, the government of the United\r\nProvinces would gladly have avoided the war; the able man who was at\r\ntheir head saw too clearly the delicate position in which they stood\r\nbetween England and France. They claimed, however, the support of the\r\nlatter in virtue of a defensive treaty made in 1662. Louis allowed the\r\nclaim, but unwillingly; and the still young navy of France gave\r\npractically no help.\r\n\r\nThe war between the two sea States was wholly maritime, and had the\r\ngeneral characteristics of all such wars. Three great battles were\r\nfought,--the first off Lowestoft, on the Norfolk coast, June 13, 1665;\r\nthe second, known as the Four Days' Battle in the Straits of Dover,\r\noften spoken of by French writers as that of the Pas de Calais,\r\nlasting from the 11th to the 14th of June, 1666; and the third, off\r\nthe North Foreland, August 4 of the same year. In the first and last\r\nof these the English had a decided success; in the second the\r\nadvantage remained with the Dutch. This one only will be described at\r\nlength, because of it alone has been found such a full, coherent\r\naccount as will allow a clear and accurate tactical narrative to be\r\ngiven. There are in these fights points of interest more generally\r\napplicable to the present day than are the details of somewhat\r\nobsolete tactical movements.\r\n\r\nIn the first battle off Lowestoft, it appears that the Dutch\r\ncommander, Opdam, who was not a seaman but a cavalry officer, had\r\nvery positive orders to fight; the discretion proper to a\r\ncommander-in-chief on the spot was not intrusted to him. To interfere\r\nthus with the commander in the field or afloat is one of the most\r\ncommon temptations to the government in the cabinet, and is generally\r\ndisastrous. Tourville, the greatest of Louis XIV.'s admirals, was\r\nforced thus to risk the whole French navy against his own judgment;\r\nand a century later a great French fleet escaped from the English\r\nadmiral Keith, through his obedience to imperative orders from his\r\nimmediate superior, who was sick in port.\r\n\r\nIn the Lowestoft fight the Dutch van gave way; and a little later one\r\nof the junior admirals of the centre, Opdam's own squadron, being\r\nkilled, the crew was seized with a panic, took the command of the\r\nship from her officers, and carried her out of action. This movement\r\nwas followed by twelve or thirteen other ships, leaving a great gap in\r\nthe Dutch line. The occurrence shows, what has before been pointed\r\nout, that the discipline of the Dutch fleet and the tone of the\r\nofficers were not high, despite the fine fighting qualities of the\r\nnation, and although it is probably true that there were more good\r\nseamen among the Dutch than among the English captains. The natural\r\nsteadfastness and heroism of the Hollanders could not wholly supply\r\nthat professional pride and sense of military honor which it is the\r\nobject of sound military institutions to encourage. Popular feeling in\r\nthe United States is pretty much at sea in this matter; there is with\r\nit no intermediate step between personal courage with a gun in its\r\nhand and entire military efficiency.\r\n\r\nOpdam, seeing the battle going against him, seems to have yielded to a\r\nfeeling approaching despair. He sought to grapple the English\r\ncommander-in-chief, who on this day was the Duke of York, the king's\r\nbrother. He failed in this, and in the desperate struggle which\r\nfollowed, his ship blew up. Shortly after, three, or as one account\r\nsays four, Dutch ships ran foul of one another, and this group was\r\nburned by one fire-ship; three or four others singly met the same fate\r\na little later. The Dutch fleet was now in disorder, and retreated\r\nunder cover of the squadron of Van Tromp, son of the famous old\r\nadmiral who in the days of the Commonwealth sailed through the Channel\r\nwith a broom at his masthead.\r\n\r\nFire-ships are seen here to have played a very conspicuous part, more\r\nso certainly than in the war of 1653, though at both periods they\r\nformed an appendage to the fleet. There is on the surface an evident\r\nresemblance between the rôle of the fire-ship and the part assigned in\r\nmodern warfare to the torpedo-cruiser. The terrible character of the\r\nattack, the comparative smallness of the vessel making it, and the\r\nlarge demands upon the nerve of the assailant, are the chief points of\r\nresemblance; the great points of difference are the comparative\r\ncertainty with which the modern vessel can be handled, which is\r\npartly met by the same advantage in the iron-clad over the old\r\nship-of-the-line, and the instantaneousness of the injury by torpedo,\r\nwhose attack fails or succeeds at once, whereas that of the fire-ship\r\nrequired time for effecting the object, which in both cases is total\r\ndestruction of the hostile ship, instead of crippling or otherwise\r\nreducing it. An appreciation of the character of fire-ships, of the\r\ncircumstances under which they attained their greatest usefulness, and\r\nof the causes which led to their disappearance, may perhaps help in\r\nthe decision to which nations must come as to whether the\r\ntorpedo-cruiser, pure and simple, is a type of weapon destined to\r\nsurvive in fleets.\r\n\r\nA French officer, who has been examining the records of the French\r\nnavy, states that the fire-ship first appears, incorporated as an arm\r\nof the fleet, in 1636.\r\n\r\n    \"Whether specially built for the purpose, or whether altered\r\n    from other purposes to be fitted for their particular end, they\r\n    received a special equipment. The command was given to officers\r\n    not noble, with the grade of captain of fire-ship. Five\r\n    subordinate officers and twenty-five seamen made up the crew.\r\n    Easily known by grappling-irons which were always fitted to\r\n    their yards, the fire-ship saw its rôle growing less in the\r\n    early years of the eighteenth century. It was finally to\r\n    disappear from the fleets _whose speed it delayed and whose\r\n    evolutions were by it complicated_. As the ships-of-war grew\r\n    larger, their action in concert with fire-ships became daily\r\n    more difficult. On the other hand, there had already been\r\n    abandoned the idea of combining them with the fighting-ships to\r\n    form a few _groups_, _each_ provided with all the means of\r\n    attack and defence. The formation of the close-hauled\r\n    line-of-battle, by assigning the fire-ships a place in a second\r\n    line placed half a league on the side farthest from the enemy,\r\n    made them more and more unfitted to fulfil their office. The\r\n    official plan of the battle of Malaga (1704), drawn up\r\n    immediately after the battle, shows the fire-ship in this\r\n    position as laid down by Paul Hoste. Finally the use of shells,\r\n    enabling ships to be set on fire more surely and quickly, and\r\n    introduced on board at the period of which we are now treating,\r\n    though the general use did not obtain until much later, was the\r\n    last blow to the fire-ship.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThose who are familiar with the theories and discussions of our own\r\nday on the subject of fleet tactics and weapons, will recognize in\r\nthis short notice of a long obsolete type certain ideas which are not\r\nobsolete. The fire-ship disappeared from fleets \"whose speed it\r\ndelayed.\" In heavy weather small bulk must always mean comparatively\r\nsmall speed. In a moderate sea, we are now told, the speed of the\r\ntorpedo-boat falls from twenty knots to fifteen or less, and the\r\nseventeen to nineteen knot cruiser can either run away from the\r\npursuing boats, or else hold them at a distance under fire of machine\r\nand heavy guns. These boats are sea-going, \"and it is thought can keep\r\nthe sea in all weathers; but to be on board a 110-foot torpedo-boat,\r\nwhen the sea is lively, is said to be far from agreeable. The heat,\r\nnoise, and rapid vibrations of the engines are intense. Cooking seems\r\nto be out of the question, and it is said that if food were well\r\ncooked few would be able to appreciate it. To obtain necessary rest\r\nunder these conditions, added to the rapid motions of the boat, is\r\nmost difficult.\" Larger boats are to be built; but the factor of loss\r\nof speed in rough weather will remain, unless the size of the\r\ntorpedo-cruiser is increased to a point that will certainly lead to\r\nfitting them with something more than torpedoes. Like fire-ships,\r\n_small_ torpedo-cruisers will delay the speed and complicate the\r\nevolutions of the fleet with which they are associated.[21] The\r\ndisappearance of the fire-ship was also hastened, we are told, by the\r\nintroduction of shell firing, or incendiary projectiles; and it is not\r\nimprobable that for deep-sea fighting the transfer of the torpedo to a\r\nclass of larger ships will put an end to the mere torpedo-cruiser. The\r\nfire-ship continued to be used against fleets at anchor down to the\r\ndays of the American Civil War; and the torpedo-boat will always be\r\nuseful within an easy distance of its port.\r\n\r\nA third phase of naval practice two hundred years ago, mentioned in\r\nthe extract quoted, involves an idea very familiar to modern\r\ndiscussions; namely, the group formation. \"The idea of combining\r\nfire-ships with the fighting-ships to form a few groups, each provided\r\nwith all the means of attack and defence,\" was for a time embraced;\r\nfor we are told that it was later on abandoned. The combining of the\r\nships of a fleet into groups of two, three, or four meant to act\r\nspecially together is now largely favored in England; less so in\r\nFrance, where it meets strong opposition. No question of this sort,\r\nably advocated on either side, is to be settled by one man's judgment,\r\nnor until time and experience have applied their infallible tests. It\r\nmay be remarked, however, that in a well-organized fleet there are two\r\ndegrees of command which are in themselves both natural and necessary,\r\nthat can be neither done away nor ignored; these are the command of\r\nthe whole fleet as one unit, and the command of each ship as a unit in\r\nitself. When a fleet becomes too large to be handled by one man, it\r\nmust be subdivided, and in the heat of action become practically two\r\nfleets acting to one common end; as Nelson, in his noble order at\r\nTrafalgar, said, \"The second in command will, _after_ my intentions\r\nare made known to him\" (mark the force of the \"after,\" which so well\r\nprotects the functions both of the commander-in-chief and the second),\r\n\"have the entire direction of his line, to make the attack upon the\r\nenemy, and to follow up the blow until they are captured or\r\ndestroyed.\"\r\n\r\nThe size and cost of the individual iron-clad of the present day makes\r\nit unlikely that fleets will be so numerous as to require subdivision;\r\nbut whether they are or not does not affect the decision of the group\r\nquestion. Looking simply to the principle underlying the theory, and\r\ndisregarding the seeming tactical clumsiness of the special groups\r\nproposed, the question is: Shall there be introduced between the\r\nnatural commands of the admiral and of the captains of individual\r\nships a third artificial contrivance, which on the one hand will in\r\neffect partly supersede the supreme authority, and on the other will\r\npartly fetter the discretion of commanders of ships? A further\r\ndifficulty springing from the narrow principle of support specially\r\ndue to particular ships, on which the group system rests, is this:\r\nthat when signals can no longer be seen, the duty of the captain to\r\nhis own ship and to the fleet at large will be complicated by his duty\r\nto observe certain relations to particular ships; which particular\r\nships must in time come to have undue prominence in his views. The\r\ngroup formation had its day of trial in old times, and disappeared\r\nbefore the test of experience; whether in its restored form it will\r\nsurvive, time will show. It may be said, before quitting the subject,\r\nthat as an order of sailing, corresponding to the route-step of an\r\narmy in march, a loose group formation has some advantages;\r\nmaintaining some order without requiring that rigid exactness of\r\nposition, to observe which by day and night must be a severe strain on\r\ncaptain and deck-officers. Such a route-order should not, however, be\r\npermitted until a fleet has reached high tactical precision.\r\n\r\nTo return to the question of fire-ships and torpedo-boats, the rôle of\r\nthe latter, it is often said, is to be found in that _mêlée_ which is\r\nalways to succeed a couple of headlong passes between the opposing\r\nfleets. In the smoke and confusion of that hour is the opportunity of\r\nthe torpedo-boat. This certainly sounds plausible, and the torpedo\r\nvessel certainly has a power of movement not possessed by the\r\nfire-ship. A _mêlée_ of the two fleets, however, was not the condition\r\nmost favorable for the fire-ship. I shall quote here from another\r\nFrench officer, whose discussion of these Anglo-Dutch sea-fights, in a\r\nlate periodical, is singularly clear and suggestive. He says:\r\n\r\n    \"Far from impeding the direct action of the fire-ship, which was\r\n    naught or nearly so during the confused battles of the war of\r\n    1652, the regularity and _ensemble_ newly attained in the\r\n    movements of squadrons seem rather to favor it. The fire-ships\r\n    played a very important part at the battles of Lowestoft, Pas de\r\n    Calais, and the North Foreland. Thanks to the good order\r\n    preserved by the ships-of-the-line, these incendiary ships can\r\n    indeed be better protected by the artillery; much more\r\n    efficiently directed than before toward a distinct and\r\n    determined end.\"[22]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the confused _mêlées_ of 1652 the fire-ship \"acted, so\r\nto speak, alone, seeking by chance an enemy to grapple, running the\r\nrisk of a mistake, without protection against the guns of the enemy,\r\nnearly sure to be sunk by him or else burned uselessly. All now, in\r\n1665, has become different. Its prey is clearly pointed out; it knows\r\nit, follows it easily into the relatively fixed position had by it in\r\nthe enemy's line. On the other hand, the ships of his own division do\r\nnot lose sight of the fire-ship. They accompany it as far as possible,\r\ncover it with their artillery to the end of its course, and disengage\r\nit before burning, if the fruitlessness of the attempt is seen soon\r\nenough. Evidently under such conditions its action, always uncertain\r\n(it cannot be otherwise), nevertheless acquires greater chances of\r\nsuccess.\" These instructive comments need perhaps the qualifying, or\r\nadditional, remark that confusion in the enemy's order at the time\r\nthat your own remains good gives the best opening for a desperate\r\nattack. The writer goes on to trace the disappearance of the\r\nfire-ship:--\r\n\r\n    \"Here then we see the fire-ship at the point of its highest\r\n    importance. That importance will decrease, the fire-ship itself\r\n    will end by disappearing from engagements in _the open sea_,\r\n    when naval artillery becoming more perfect shall have greater\r\n    range, be more accurate and more rapid;[23] when ships receiving\r\n    better forms, greater steering power, more extensive and better\r\n    balanced sail power, shall be able, thanks to quicker speed and\r\n    handling, to avoid almost certainly the fire-ships sent against\r\n    them; when, finally, fleets led on principles of tactics as\r\n    skilful as they were timid, a tactics which will predominate a\r\n    century later during the whole war of American Independence,\r\n    when these fleets, in order not to jeopardize the perfect\r\n    regularity of their order of battle, will avoid coming to close\r\n    quarters, and will leave to the cannon alone to decide the fate\r\n    of an action.\"\r\n\r\nIn this discussion the writer has in view the leading feature which,\r\nwhile aiding the action of the fire-ship, also gives this war of 1665\r\nits peculiar interest in the history of naval tactics. In it is found\r\nfor the first time the close-hauled line-of-battle undeniably adopted\r\nas the fighting order of the fleets. It is plain enough that when\r\nthose fleets numbered, as they often did, from eighty to a hundred\r\nships, such lines would be very imperfectly formed in every essential,\r\nboth of line and interval; but the general aim is evident, amid\r\nwhatever imperfections of execution. The credit for this development\r\nis generally given to the Duke of York, afterward James II.; but the\r\nquestion to whom the improvement is due is of little importance to\r\nsea-officers of the present day when compared with the instructive\r\nfact that so long a time elapsed between the appearance of the large\r\nsailing-ship, with its broadside battery, and the systematic adoption\r\nof the order which was best adapted to develop the full power of the\r\nfleet for mutual support. To us, having the elements of the problem in\r\nour hands, together with the result finally reached, that result seems\r\nsimple enough, almost self-evident. Why did it take so long for the\r\ncapable men of that day to reach it? The reason--and herein lies the\r\nlesson for the officer of to-day--was doubtless the same that leaves\r\nthe order of battle so uncertain now; namely, that the necessity of\r\nwar did not force men to make up their minds, until the Dutch at last\r\nmet in the English their equals on the sea. The sequence of ideas\r\nwhich resulted in the line-of-battle is clear and logical. Though\r\nfamiliar enough to seamen, it will be here stated in the words of the\r\nwriter last quoted, because they have a neatness and precision\r\nentirely French:--\r\n\r\n    \"With the increase of power of the ship-of-war, and with the\r\n    perfecting of its sea and warlike qualities, there has come an\r\n    equal progress in the art of utilizing them.... As naval\r\n    evolutions become more skilful, their importance grows from day\r\n    to day. To these evolutions there is needed a base, a point from\r\n    which they depart and to which they return. A fleet of war-ships\r\n    must be always ready to meet an enemy; logically, therefore,\r\n    this point of departure for naval evolutions must be the order\r\n    of battle. Now, since the disappearance of galleys, almost all\r\n    the artillery is found upon the sides of a ship of war. Hence\r\n    it is the beam that must necessarily and always be turned toward\r\n    the enemy. On the other hand, it is necessary that the sight of\r\n    the latter must never be interrupted by a friendly ship. Only\r\n    one formation allows the ships of the same fleet to satisfy\r\n    fully these conditions. That formation is the line ahead\r\n    [column]. This line, therefore, is imposed as the only order of\r\n    battle, and consequently as the basis of all fleet tactics. In\r\n    order that this order of battle, this long thin line of guns,\r\n    may not be injured or broken at some point weaker than the rest,\r\n    there is at the same time felt the necessity of putting in it\r\n    only ships which, if not of equal force, have at least equally\r\n    strong sides. Logically it follows, at the same moment in which\r\n    the line ahead became definitively the order for battle, there\r\n    was established the distinction between the ships 'of the line,'\r\n    alone destined for a place therein, and the lighter ships meant\r\n    for other uses.\"\r\n\r\nIf to these we add the considerations which led to making the\r\nline-of-battle a close-hauled line, we have the problem fully worked\r\nout. But the chain of reasoning was as clear two hundred and fifty\r\nyears ago as it is now; why then was it so long in being worked out?\r\nPartly, no doubt, because old traditions--in those days traditions of\r\ngalley-fighting--had hold of and confused men's minds; chiefly because\r\nmen are too indolent to seek out the foundation truths of the\r\nsituation in their day, and develop the true theory of action from its\r\nbase up. As a rare instance of clear-sightedness, recognizing such a\r\nfundamental change in conditions and predicting results, words of\r\nAdmiral Labrousse of the French navy, written in 1840, are most\r\ninstructive. \"Thanks to steam,\" he wrote, \"ships will be able to move\r\nin any direction with such speed that the effects of collision may,\r\nand indeed must, as they formerly did, take the place of projectile\r\nweapons and annul the calculations of the skilful manoeuvrer. The ram\r\nwill be favorable to speed, without destroying the nautical qualities\r\nof a ship. As soon as one power shall have adopted this terrible\r\nweapon, all others must accept it, under pain of evident inferiority,\r\nand thus combats will become combats of ram against ram.\" While\r\nforbearing the unconditional adhesion to the ram as the controlling\r\nweapon of the day, which the French navy has yielded, the above brief\r\nargument may well be taken as an instance of the way in which\r\nresearches into the order of battle of the future should be worked\r\nout. A French writer, commenting on Labrousse's paper, says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Twenty-seven years were scarce enough for our fathers, counting\r\n    from 1638, the date of building the 'Couronne,' to 1665, to pass\r\n    from the tactical order of the line abreast, the order for\r\n    galleys, to that of the line ahead. We ourselves needed\r\n    twenty-nine years from 1830, when the first steamship was\r\n    brought into our fleet, to 1859, when the application of the\r\n    principle of ram-fighting was affirmed by laying down the\r\n    'Solferino' and the 'Magenta' to work a revolution in the\r\n    contrary direction; so true it is that truth is always slow in\r\n    getting to the light.... This transformation was not sudden, not\r\n    only because the new material required time to be built and\r\n    armed, but above all, it is sad to say, because the necessary\r\n    consequences of the new motive power escaped most minds.\"[24]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the justly celebrated Four Days' Battle of June, 1666,\r\nwhich claims special notice, not only on account of the great number\r\nof ships engaged on either side, nor yet only for the extraordinary\r\nphysical endurance of the men who kept up a hot naval action for so\r\nmany successive days, but also because the commanders-in-chief on\r\neither side, Monk and De Ruyter, were the most distinguished seamen,\r\nor rather sea-commanders, brought forth by their respective countries\r\nin the seventeenth century. Monk was possibly inferior to Blake in the\r\nannals of the English navy; but there is a general agreement that De\r\nRuyter is the foremost figure, not only in the Dutch service, but\r\namong all the naval officers of that age. The account about to be\r\ngiven is mainly taken from a recent number of the \"Revue Maritime et\r\nColoniale,\"[25] and is there published as a letter, recently\r\ndiscovered, from a Dutch gentleman serving as volunteer on board De\r\nRuyter's ship, to a friend in France. The narrative is delightfully\r\nclear and probable,--qualities not generally found in the description\r\nof those long-ago fights; and the satisfaction it gave was increased\r\nby finding in the Memoirs of the Count de Guiche, who also served as\r\nvolunteer in the fleet, and was taken to De Ruyter after his own\r\nvessel had been destroyed by a fire-ship, an account confirming the\r\nformer in its principal details.[26] This additional pleasure was\r\nunhappily marred by recognizing certain phrases as common to both\r\nstories; and a comparison showed that the two could not be accepted as\r\nindependent narratives. There are, however, points of internal\r\ndifference which make it possible that the two accounts are by\r\ndifferent eye-witnesses, who compared and corrected their versions\r\nbefore sending them out to their friends or writing them in their\r\njournals.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the two fleets were: English about eighty ships, the\r\nDutch about one hundred; but the inequality in numbers was largely\r\ncompensated by the greater size of many of the English. A great\r\nstrategic blunder by the government in London immediately preceded the\r\nfight. The king was informed that a French squadron was on its way\r\nfrom the Atlantic to join the Dutch. He at once divided his fleet,\r\nsending twenty ships under Prince Rupert to the westward to meet the\r\nFrench, while the remainder under Monk were to go east and oppose the\r\nDutch.\r\n\r\nA position like that of the English fleet, threatened with an attack\r\nfrom two quarters, presents one of the subtlest temptations to a\r\ncommander. The impulse is very strong to meet both by dividing his own\r\nnumbers as Charles did; but unless in possession of overwhelming force\r\nit is an error, exposing both divisions to be beaten separately,\r\nwhich, as we are about to see, actually happened in this case. The\r\nresult of the first two days was disastrous to the larger English\r\ndivision under Monk, which was then obliged to retreat toward Rupert;\r\nand probably the opportune return of the latter alone saved the\r\nEnglish fleet from a very serious loss, or at the least from being\r\nshut up in their own ports. A hundred and forty years later, in the\r\nexciting game of strategy that was played in the Bay of Biscay before\r\nTrafalgar, the English admiral Cornwallis made precisely the same\r\nblunder, dividing his fleet into two equal parts out of supporting\r\ndistance, which Napoleon at the time characterized as a glaring piece\r\nof stupidity. The lesson is the same in all ages.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. I.]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch had sailed for the English coast with a fair easterly wind,\r\nbut it changed later to southwest with thick weather, and freshened,\r\nso that De Ruyter, to avoid being driven too far, came to anchor\r\nbetween Dunkirk and the Downs.[27] The fleet then rode with its head\r\nto the south-southwest and the van on the right; while Tromp, who\r\ncommanded the rear division in the natural order, was on the left. For\r\nsome cause this left was most to windward, the centre squadron under\r\nRuyter being to leeward, and the right, or van, to leeward again of\r\nthe centre.[28] This was the position of the Dutch fleet at daylight\r\nof June 11, 1666; and although not expressly so stated, it is likely,\r\nfrom the whole tenor of the narratives, that it was not in good order.\r\n\r\nThe same morning Monk, who was also at anchor, made out the Dutch\r\nfleet to leeward, and although so inferior in numbers determined to\r\nattack at once, hoping that by keeping the advantage of the wind he\r\nwould be able to commit himself only so far as might seem best. He\r\ntherefore stood along the Dutch line on the starboard tack, leaving\r\nthe right and centre out of cannon-shot, until he came abreast of the\r\nleft, Tromp's squadron. Monk then had thirty-five ships well in hand;\r\nbut the rear had opened and was straggling, as is apt to be the case\r\nwith long columns. With the thirty-five he then put his helm up and\r\nran down for Tromp, whose squadron cut their cables and made sail on\r\nthe same tack (V'); the two engaged lines thus standing over toward\r\nthe French coast, and the breeze heeling the ships so that the English\r\ncould not use their lower-deck guns (Fig. 2, V''). The Dutch centre\r\nand rear also cut (Fig. 1, C'), and followed the movement, but being\r\nso far to leeward, could not for some time come into action. It was\r\nduring this time that a large Dutch ship, becoming separated from her\r\nown fleet, was set on fire and burned, doubtless the ship in which was\r\nCount de Guiche.\r\n\r\nAs they drew near Dunkirk the English went about, probably all\r\ntogether; for in the return to the northward and westward the proper\r\nEnglish van fell in with and was roughly handled by the Dutch centre\r\nunder Ruyter himself (Fig. 2, C''). This fate would be more likely to\r\nbefall the rear, and indicates that a simultaneous movement had\r\nreversed the order. The engaged ships had naturally lost to leeward,\r\nthus enabling Ruyter to fetch up with them. Two English flag-ships\r\nwere here disabled and cut off; one, the \"Swiftsure,\" hauled down her\r\ncolors after the admiral, a young man of only twenty-seven, was\r\nkilled. \"Highly to be admired,\" says a contemporary writer, \"was the\r\nresolution of Vice-Admiral Berkeley, who, though cut off from the\r\nline, surrounded by enemies, great numbers of his men killed, his ship\r\ndisabled and boarded on all sides, yet continued fighting almost\r\nalone, killed several with his own hand, and would accept no quarter;\r\ntill at length, being shot in the throat with a musket-ball, he\r\nretired into the captain's cabin, where he was found dead, extended at\r\nhis full length upon a table, and almost covered with his own blood.\"\r\nQuite as heroic, but more fortunate in its issue, was the conduct of\r\nthe other English admiral thus cut off; and the incidents of his\r\nstruggle, though not specially instructive otherwise, are worth\r\nquoting, as giving a lively picture of the scenes which passed in the\r\nheat of the contests of those days, and afford coloring to otherwise\r\ndry details.\r\n\r\n    \"Being in a short time completely disabled, one of the enemy's\r\n    fire-ships grappled him on the starboard quarter; he was,\r\n    however, freed by the almost incredible exertions of his\r\n    lieutenant, who, having in the midst of the flames loosed the\r\n    grappling-irons, swung back on board his own ship unhurt. The\r\n    Dutch, bent on the destruction of this unfortunate ship, sent a\r\n    second which grappled her on the larboard side, and with greater\r\n    success than the former; for the sails instantly taking fire,\r\n    the crew were so terrified that nearly fifty of them jumped\r\n    overboard. The admiral, Sir John Harman, seeing this confusion,\r\n    ran with his sword drawn among those who remained, and\r\n    threatened with instant death the first man who should attempt\r\n    to quit the ship, or should not exert himself to quench the\r\n    flames. The crew then returned to their duty and got the fire\r\n    under; but the rigging being a good deal burned, one of the\r\n    topsail yards fell and broke Sir John's leg. In the midst of\r\n    this accumulated distress, a third fire-ship prepared to grapple\r\n    him, but was sunk by the guns before she could effect her\r\n    purpose. The Dutch vice-admiral, Evertzen, now bore down to him\r\n    and offered quarter; but Sir John replied, 'No, no, it is not\r\n    come to that yet,' and giving him a broadside, killed the Dutch\r\n    commander; after which the other enemies sheered off.\"[29]\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not surprising that the account we have been following\r\nreported two English flag-ships lost, one by a fire-ship. \"The English\r\nchief still continued on the port tack, and,\" says the writer, \"as\r\nnight fell we could see him proudly leading his line past the squadron\r\nof North Holland and Zealand [the actual rear, but proper van], which\r\nfrom noon up to that time had not been able to reach the enemy [Fig.\r\n2, R''] from their leewardly position.\" The merit of Monk's attack as\r\na piece of grand tactics is evident, and bears a strong resemblance to\r\nthat of Nelson at the Nile. Discerning quickly the weakness of the\r\nDutch order, he had attacked a vastly superior force in such a way\r\nthat only part of it could come into action; and though the English\r\nactually lost more heavily, they carried off a brilliant prestige and\r\nmust have left considerable depression and heart-burning among the\r\nDutch. The eye-witness goes on: \"The affair continued until ten P.M.,\r\nfriends and foes mixed together and as likely to receive injury from\r\none as from the other. It will be remarked that the success of the day\r\nand the misfortunes of the English came from their being too much\r\nscattered, too extended in their line; but for which we could never\r\nhave cut off a corner of them, as we did. The mistake of Monk was in\r\nnot keeping his ships better together;\" that is, closed up. The remark\r\nis just, the criticism scarcely so; the opening out of the line was\r\nalmost unavoidable in so long a column of sailing-ships, and was one\r\nof the chances taken by Monk when he offered battle.\r\n\r\nThe English stood off on the port tack to the west or west-northwest,\r\nand next day returned to the fight. The Dutch were now on the port\r\ntack in natural order, the right leading, and were to windward; but\r\nthe enemy, being more weatherly and better disciplined, soon gained\r\nthe advantage of the wind. The English this day had forty-four ships\r\nin action, the Dutch about eighty; many of the English, as before\r\nsaid, larger. The two fleets passed on opposite tacks, the English to\r\nwindward;[30] but Tromp, in the rear, seeing that the Dutch order of\r\nbattle was badly formed, the ships in two or three lines, overlapping\r\nand so masking each other's fire, went about and gained to windward of\r\nthe enemy's van (R'); which he was able to do from the length of the\r\nline, and because the English, running parallel to the Dutch order,\r\nwere off the wind. \"At this moment two flag-officers of the Dutch van\r\nkept broad off, presenting their sterns to the English (V'). Ruyter,\r\ngreatly astonished, tried to stop them, but in vain, and therefore\r\nfelt obliged to imitate the manoeuvre in order to keep his squadron\r\ntogether; but he did so with some order, keeping some ships around\r\nhim, and was joined by one of the van ships, disgusted with the\r\nconduct of his immediate superior. Tromp was now in great danger,\r\nseparated [by his own act first and then by the conduct of the van]\r\nfrom his own fleet by the English, and would have been destroyed but\r\nfor Ruyter, who, seeing the urgency of the case, hauled up for him,\"\r\nthe van and centre thus standing back for the rear on the opposite\r\ntack to that on which they entered action. This prevented the English\r\nfrom keeping up the attack on Tromp, lest Ruyter should gain the wind\r\nof them, which they could not afford to yield because of their very\r\ninferior numbers. Both the action of Tromp and that of the junior\r\nflag-officers in the van, though showing very different degrees of\r\nwarlike ardor, bring out strongly the lack of subordination and of\r\nmilitary feeling which has been charged against the Dutch officers as\r\na body; no signs of which appear among the English at this time.\r\n\r\nHow keenly Ruyter felt the conduct of his lieutenants was manifested\r\nwhen \"Tromp, immediately after this partial action, went on board his\r\nflagship. The seamen cheered him; but Ruyter said, 'This is no time\r\nfor rejoicing, but rather for tears.' Indeed, our position was bad,\r\neach squadron acting differently, in no line, and all the ships\r\nhuddled together like a flock of sheep, so packed that the English\r\nmight have surrounded all of them with their forty ships [June 12,\r\nFig. 2]. The English were in admirable order, but did not push their\r\nadvantage as they should, whatever the reason.\" The reason no doubt\r\nwas the same that often prevented sailing-ships from pressing an\r\nadvantage,--disability from crippled spars and rigging, added to the\r\ninexpediency of such inferior numbers risking a decisive action.\r\n\r\nRuyter was thus able to draw his fleet out into line again, although\r\nmuch maltreated by the English, and the two fleets passed again on\r\nopposite tacks, the Dutch to leeward, and Ruyter's ship the last in\r\nhis column. As he passed the English rear, he lost his maintopmast and\r\nmainyard. After another partial rencounter the English drew away to\r\nthe northwest toward their own shores, the Dutch following them; the\r\nwind being still from southwest, but light. The English were now\r\nfairly in retreat, and the pursuit continued all night, Ruyter's own\r\nship dropping out of sight in the rear from her crippled state.\r\n\r\nThe third day Monk continued retreating to the westward. He burned, by\r\nthe English accounts, three disabled ships, sent ahead those that were\r\nmost crippled, and himself brought up the rear with those that were in\r\nfighting condition, which are variously stated, again by the English,\r\nat twenty-eight and sixteen in number (Plate II., June 13). One of the\r\nlargest and finest of the English fleet, the \"Royal Prince,\" of ninety\r\nguns, ran aground on the Galloper Shoal and was taken by Tromp (Plate\r\nII. a); but Monk's retreat was so steady and orderly that he was\r\notherwise unmolested. This shows that the Dutch had suffered very\r\nseverely. Toward evening Rupert's squadron was seen; and all the ships\r\nof the English fleet, except those crippled in action, were at last\r\nunited.\r\n\r\nThe next day the wind came out again very fresh from the southwest,\r\ngiving the Dutch the weather-gage. The English, instead of attempting\r\nto pass upon opposite tacks, came up from astern relying upon the\r\nspeed and handiness of their ships. So doing, the battle engaged all\r\nalong the line on the port tack, the English to leeward.[31] The Dutch\r\nfire-ships were badly handled and did no harm, whereas the English\r\nburned two of their enemies. The two fleets ran on thus, exchanging\r\nbroadsides for two hours, at the end of which time the bulk of the\r\nEnglish fleet had passed through the Dutch line.[32] All regularity of\r\norder was henceforward lost. \"At this moment,\" says the eye-witness,\r\n\"the lookout was extraordinary, for all were separated, the English as\r\nwell as we. But luck would have it that the largest of our fractions\r\nsurrounding the admiral remained to windward, and the largest fraction\r\nof the English, also with their admiral, remained to leeward [Figs. 1\r\nand 2, C and C']. This was the cause of our victory and their ruin.\r\nOur admiral had with him thirty-five or forty ships of his own and of\r\nother squadrons, for the squadrons were scattered and order much lost.\r\nThe rest of the Dutch ships had left him. The leader of the van, Van\r\nNess, had gone off with fourteen ships in chase of three or four\r\nEnglish ships, which under a press of sail had gained to windward of\r\nthe Dutch van [Fig. 1, V]. Van Tromp with the rear squadron had\r\nfallen to leeward, and so had to keep on [to leeward of Ruyter and the\r\nEnglish main body, Fig. 1, R] after Van Ness, in order to rejoin the\r\nadmiral by passing round the English centre.\" De Ruyter and the\r\nEnglish main body kept up a sharp action, beating to windward all the\r\ntime. Tromp, having carried sail, overtook Van Ness, and returned\r\nbringing the van back with him (V', R'); but owing to the constant\r\nplying to windward of the English main body he came up to leeward of\r\nit and could not rejoin Ruyter, who was to windward (Fig. 3, V'',\r\nR''). Ruyter, seeing this, made signal to the ships around him, and\r\nthe main body of the Dutch kept away before the wind (Fig 3, C''),\r\nwhich was then very strong. \"Thus in less than no time we found\r\nourselves in the midst of the English; who, being attacked on both\r\nsides, were thrown into confusion and saw their whole order destroyed,\r\nas well by dint of the action, as by the strong wind that was then\r\nblowing. This was the hottest of the fight [Fig. 3]. We saw the high\r\nadmiral of England separated from his fleet, followed only by one\r\nfire-ship. With that he gained to windward, and passing through the\r\nNorth Holland squadron, placed himself again at the head of fifteen or\r\ntwenty ships that rallied to him.\"\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. II.]\r\n\r\nThus ended this great sea-fight, the most remarkable, in some of its\r\naspects, that has ever been fought upon the ocean. Amid conflicting\r\nreports it is not possible to do more than estimate the results. A\r\nfairly impartial account says: \"The States lost in these actions three\r\nvice-admirals, two thousand men, and four ships. The loss of the\r\nEnglish was five thousand killed and three thousand prisoners; and\r\nthey lost besides seventeen ships, of which nine remained in the hands\r\nof the victors.\"[33] There is no doubt that the English had much the\r\nworst of it, and that this was owing wholly to the original blunder of\r\nweakening the fleet by a great detachment sent in another direction.\r\nGreat detachments are sometimes necessary evils, but in this case no\r\nnecessity existed. Granting the approach of the French, the proper\r\ncourse for the English was to fall with their whole fleet upon the\r\nDutch before their allies could come up. This lesson is as applicable\r\nto-day as it ever was. A second lesson, likewise of present\r\napplication, is the necessity of sound military institutions for\r\nimplanting correct military feeling, pride, and discipline. Great as\r\nwas the first blunder of the English, and serious as was the disaster,\r\nthere can be no doubt that the consequences would have been much worse\r\nbut for the high spirit and skill with which the plans of Monk were\r\ncarried out by his subordinates, and the lack of similar support to\r\nRuyter on the part of the Dutch subalterns. In the movements of the\r\nEnglish, we hear nothing of two juniors turning tail at a critical\r\nmoment, nor of a third, with misdirected ardor, getting on the wrong\r\nside of the enemy's fleet. Their drill also, their tactical precision,\r\nwas remarked even then. The Frenchman De Guiche, after witnessing this\r\nFour Days' Fight, wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nothing equals the beautiful order of the English at sea. Never\r\n    was a line drawn straighter than that formed by their ships;\r\n    thus they bring all their fire to bear upon those who draw near\r\n    them.... They fight like a line of cavalry which is handled\r\n    according to rule, and applies itself solely to force back those\r\n    who oppose; whereas the Dutch advance like cavalry whose\r\n    squadrons leave their ranks and come separately to the\r\n    charge.\"[34]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch government, averse to expense, unmilitary in its tone, and\r\nincautious from long and easy victory over the degenerate navy of\r\nSpain, had allowed its fleet to sink into a mere assembly of armed\r\nmerchantmen. Things were at their worst in the days of Cromwell.\r\nTaught by the severe lessons of that war, the United Provinces, under\r\nan able ruler, had done much to mend matters, but full efficiency had\r\nnot yet been gained.\r\n\r\n    \"In 1666 as in 1653,\" says a French naval writer, \"the fortune\r\n    of war seemed to lean to the side of the English. Of the three\r\n    great battles fought two were decided victories; and the third,\r\n    though adverse, had but increased the glory of her seamen. This\r\n    was due to the intelligent boldness of Monk and Rupert, the\r\n    talents of part of the admirals and captains, and the skill of\r\n    the seamen and soldiers under them. The wise and vigorous\r\n    efforts made by the government of the United Provinces, and the\r\n    undeniable superiority of Ruyter in experience and genius over\r\n    any one of his opponents, could not compensate for the weakness\r\n    or incapacity of part of the Dutch officers, and the manifest\r\n    inferiority of the men under their orders.\"[35]\r\n\r\nEngland, as has been said before, still felt the impress of Cromwell's\r\niron hand upon her military institutions; but that impress was growing\r\nweaker. Before the next Dutch war Monk was dead, and was poorly\r\nreplaced by the cavalier Rupert. Court extravagance cut down the\r\nequipment of the navy as did the burgomaster's parsimony, and court\r\ncorruption undermined discipline as surely as commercial indifference.\r\nThe effect was evident when the fleets of the two countries met again,\r\nsix years later.\r\n\r\nThere was one well-known feature of all the military navies of that\r\nday which calls for a passing comment; for its correct bearing and\r\nvalue is not always, perhaps not generally, seen. The command of\r\nfleets and of single vessels was often given to soldiers, to military\r\nmen unaccustomed to the sea, and ignorant how to handle the ship, that\r\nduty being intrusted to another class of officer. Looking closely into\r\nthe facts, it is seen that this made a clean division between the\r\ndirection of the fighting and of the motive power of the ship. This is\r\nthe essence of the matter; and the principle is the same whatever the\r\nmotive power may be. The inconvenience and inefficiency of such a\r\nsystem was obvious then as it is now, and the logic of facts gradually\r\nthrew the two functions into the hands of one corps of officers, the\r\nresult being the modern naval officer, as that term is generally\r\nunderstood.[36] Unfortunately, in this process of blending, the less\r\nimportant function was allowed to get the upper hand; the naval\r\nofficer came to feel more proud of his dexterity in managing the\r\nmotive power of his ship than of his skill in developing her military\r\nefficiency. The bad effects of this lack of interest in military\r\nscience became most evident when the point of handling fleets was\r\nreached, because for that military skill told most, and previous study\r\nwas most necessary; but it was felt in the single ship as well. Hence\r\nit came to pass, and especially in the English navy, that the pride of\r\nthe seaman took the place of the pride of the military man. The\r\nEnglish naval officer thought more of that which likened him to the\r\nmerchant captain than of that which made him akin to the soldier. In\r\nthe French navy this result was less general, owing probably to the\r\nmore military spirit of the government, and especially of the\r\nnobility, to whom the rank of officer was reserved. It was not\r\npossible that men whose whole association was military, all of whose\r\nfriends looked upon arms as the one career for a gentleman, could\r\nthink more of the sails and rigging than of the guns or the fleet. The\r\nEnglish corps of officers was of different origin. There was more than\r\nthe writer thought in Macaulay's well-known saying: \"There were seamen\r\nand there were gentlemen in the navy of Charles II.; but the seamen\r\nwere not gentlemen, and the gentlemen were not seamen.\" The trouble\r\nwas not in the absence or presence of gentlemen as such, but in the\r\nfact that under the conditions of that day the gentleman was\r\npre-eminently the military element of society; and that the seaman,\r\nafter the Dutch wars, gradually edged the gentleman, and with him the\r\nmilitary tone and spirit as distinguished from simple courage, out of\r\nthe service. Even \"such men of family as Herbert and Russell, William\r\nIII.'s admirals,\" says the biographer of Lord Hawke, \"were sailors\r\nindeed, but only able to hold their own by adopting the boisterous\r\nmanners of the hardy tarpaulin.\" The same national traits which made\r\nthe French inferior as seamen made them superior as military men; not\r\nin courage, but in skill. To this day the same tendency obtains; the\r\ndirection of the motive power has no such consideration as the\r\nmilitary functions in the navies of the Latin nations. The studious\r\nand systematic side of the French character also inclined the French\r\nofficer, when not a trifler, to consider and develop tactical\r\nquestions in a logical manner; to prepare himself to handle fleets,\r\nnot merely as a seaman but as a military man. The result showed, in\r\nthe American Revolutionary War, that despite a mournful history of\r\ngovernmental neglect, men who were first of all military men, inferior\r\nthough they were in opportunities as seamen to their enemies, could\r\nmeet them on more than equal terms as to tactical skill, and were\r\npractically their superiors in handling fleets. The false theory has\r\nalready been pointed out, which directed the action of the French\r\nfleet not to crushing its enemy, but to some ulterior aim; but this\r\ndoes not affect the fact that in tactical skill the military men were\r\nsuperior to the mere seamen, though their tactical skill was applied\r\nto mistaken strategic ends. The source whence the Dutch mainly drew\r\ntheir officers does not certainly appear; for while the English naval\r\nhistorian in 1666 says that most of the captains of their fleet were\r\nsons of rich burgomasters, placed there for political reasons by the\r\nGrand Pensionary, and without experience, Duquesne, the ablest French\r\nadmiral of the day, comments in 1676 on the precision and skill of the\r\nDutch captains in terms very disparaging to his own. It is likely,\r\nfrom many indications, that they were generally merchant seamen, with\r\nlittle original military feeling; but the severity with which the\r\ndelinquents were punished both by the State and by popular frenzy,\r\nseems to have driven these officers, who were far from lacking the\r\nhighest personal courage, into a sense of what military loyalty and\r\nsubordination required. They made a very different record in 1672 from\r\nthat of 1666.\r\n\r\nBefore finally leaving the Four Days' Fight, the conclusions of\r\nanother writer may well be quoted:--\r\n\r\n    \"Such was that bloody Battle of the Four Days, or Straits of\r\n    Calais, the most memorable sea-fight of modern days; not,\r\n    indeed, by its results, but by the aspect of its different\r\n    phases; by the fury of the combatants; by the boldness and skill\r\n    of the leaders; and by the new character which it gave to sea\r\n    warfare. More than any other this fight marks clearly the\r\n    passage from former methods to the tactics of the end of the\r\n    seventeenth century. For the first time we can follow, as though\r\n    traced upon a plan, the principal movements of the contending\r\n    fleets. It seems quite clear that to the Dutch as well as to the\r\n    British have been given a tactical book and a code of signals;\r\n    or, at the least, written instructions, extensive and precise,\r\n    to serve instead of such a code. We feel that each admiral now\r\n    has his squadron in hand, and that even the commander-in-chief\r\n    disposes at his will, during the fight, of the various\r\n    subdivisions of his fleet. Compare this action with those of\r\n    1652, and one plain fact stares you in the face,--that between\r\n    the two dates naval tactics have undergone a revolution.\r\n\r\n    \"Such were the changes that distinguish the war of 1665 from\r\n    that of 1652. As in the latter epoch, the admiral still thinks\r\n    the weather-gage an advantage for his fleet; but it is no\r\n    longer, from the tactical point of view, the principal, we might\r\n    almost say the sole, preoccupation. Now he wishes above all to\r\n    keep his fleet in good order and compact as long as possible, so\r\n    as to keep the power of _combining_, during the action, the\r\n    movements of the different squadrons. Look at Ruyter, at the end\r\n    of the Four Days' Fight; with great difficulty he has kept to\r\n    windward of the English fleet, yet he does not hesitate to\r\n    sacrifice this advantage in order to unite the two parts of his\r\n    fleet, which are separated by the enemy. If at the later fight\r\n    off the North Foreland great intervals exist between the Dutch\r\n    squadrons, if the rear afterward continues to withdraw from the\r\n    centre, Ruyter deplores such a fault as the chief cause of his\r\n    defeat. He so deplores it in his official report; he even\r\n    accuses Tromp [who was his personal enemy] of treason or\r\n    cowardice,--an unjust accusation, but which none the less shows\r\n    the enormous importance thenceforth attached, during action, to\r\n    the reunion of the fleet into a whole strictly and regularly\r\n    maintained.\"[37]\r\n\r\nThis commentary is justified in so far as it points out general aims\r\nand tendencies; but the results were not as complete as might be\r\ninferred from it.\r\n\r\nThe English, notwithstanding their heavy loss in the Four Days'\r\nBattle, were at sea again within two months, much to the surprise of\r\nthe Dutch; and on the 4th of August another severe fight was fought\r\noff the North Foreland, ending in the complete defeat of the latter,\r\nwho retired to their own coasts. The English followed, and effected an\r\nentrance into one of the Dutch harbors, where they destroyed a large\r\nfleet of merchantmen as well as a town of some importance. Toward the\r\nend of 1666 both sides were tired of the war, which was doing great\r\nharm to trade, and weakening both navies to the advantage of the\r\ngrowing sea power of France. Negotiations looking toward peace were\r\nopened; but Charles II., ill disposed to the United Provinces,\r\nconfident that the growing pretensions of Louis XIV. to the Spanish\r\nNetherlands would break up the existing alliance between Holland and\r\nFrance, and relying also upon the severe reverses suffered at sea by\r\nthe Dutch, was exacting and haughty in his demands. To justify and\r\nmaintain this line of conduct he should have kept up his fleet, the\r\nprestige of which had been so advanced by its victories. Instead of\r\nthat, poverty, the result of extravagance and of his home policy, led\r\nhim to permit it to decline; ships in large numbers were laid up; and\r\nhe readily adopted an opinion which chimed in with his penury, and\r\nwhich, as it has had advocates at all periods of sea history, should\r\nbe noted and condemned here. This opinion, warmly opposed by Monk,\r\nwas:--\r\n\r\n    \"That as the Dutch were chiefly supported by trade, as the\r\n    supply of their navy depended upon trade, and, as experience\r\n    showed, nothing provoked the people so much as injuring their\r\n    trade, his Majesty should therefore apply himself to this, which\r\n    would effectually humble them, at the same time that it would\r\n    less exhaust the English than fitting out such mighty fleets as\r\n    had hitherto kept the sea every summer.... Upon these motives\r\n    the king took a fatal resolution of laying up his great ships\r\n    and keeping only a few frigates on the cruise.\"[38]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this economical theory of carrying on a war, the\r\nGrand Pensionary of Holland, De Witt, who had the year before caused\r\nsoundings of the Thames to be made, sent into the river, under De\r\nRuyter, a force of sixty or seventy ships-of-the-line, which on the\r\n14th of June, 1667, went up as high as Gravesend, destroying ships at\r\nChatham and in the Medway, and taking possession of Sheerness. The\r\nlight of the fires could be seen from London, and the Dutch fleet\r\nremained in possession of the mouth of the river until the end of the\r\nmonth. Under this blow, following as it did upon the great plague and\r\nthe great fire of London, Charles consented to peace, which was signed\r\nJuly 31, 1667, and is known as the Peace of Breda. The most lasting\r\nresult of the war was the transfer of New York and New Jersey to\r\nEngland, thus joining her northern and southern colonies in North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nBefore going on again with the general course of the history of the\r\ntimes, it will be well to consider for a moment the theory which\r\nworked so disastrously for England in 1667; that, namely, of\r\nmaintaining a sea-war mainly by preying upon the enemy's commerce.\r\nThis plan, which involves only the maintenance of a few swift cruisers\r\nand can be backed by the spirit of greed in a nation, fitting out\r\nprivateers without direct expense to the State, possesses the specious\r\nattractions which economy always presents. The great injury done to\r\nthe wealth and prosperity of the enemy is also undeniable; and\r\nalthough to some extent his merchant-ships can shelter themselves\r\nignobly under a foreign flag while the war lasts, this _guerre de\r\ncourse_, as the French call it, this commerce-destroying, to use our\r\nown phrase, must, if in itself successful, greatly embarrass the\r\nforeign government and distress its people. Such a war, however,\r\ncannot stand alone; it must be _supported_, to use the military\r\nphrase; unsubstantial and evanescent in itself, it cannot reach far\r\nfrom its base. That base must be either home ports, or else some solid\r\noutpost of the national power, on the shore or the sea; a distant\r\ndependency or a powerful fleet. Failing such support, the cruiser can\r\nonly dash out hurriedly a short distance from home, and its blows,\r\nthough painful, cannot be fatal. It was not the policy of 1667, but\r\nCromwell's powerful fleets of ships-of-the-line in 1652, that shut\r\nthe Dutch merchantmen in their ports and caused the grass to grow in\r\nthe streets of Amsterdam. When, instructed by the suffering of that\r\ntime, the Dutch kept large fleets afloat through two exhausting wars,\r\nthough their commerce suffered greatly, they bore up the burden of the\r\nstrife against England and France united. Forty years later, Louis\r\nXIV. was driven, by exhaustion, to the policy adopted by Charles II.\r\nthrough parsimony. Then were the days of the great French privateers,\r\nJean Bart, Forbin, Duguay-Trouin, Du Casse, and others. The regular\r\nfleets of the French navy were practically withdrawn from the ocean\r\nduring the great War of the Spanish Succession (1702-1712). The French\r\nnaval historian says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Unable to renew the naval armaments, Louis XIV. increased the\r\n    number of cruisers upon the more frequented seas, especially the\r\n    Channel and the German Ocean [not far from home, it will be\r\n    noticed]. In these different spots the cruisers were always in a\r\n    position to intercept or hinder the movements of transports\r\n    laden with troops, and of the numerous convoys carrying supplies\r\n    of all kinds. In these seas, in the centre of the commercial and\r\n    political world, there is always work for cruisers.\r\n    Notwithstanding the difficulties they met, owing to the absence\r\n    of large friendly fleets, they served advantageously the cause\r\n    of the two peoples [French and Spanish]. These cruisers, in the\r\n    face of the Anglo-Dutch power, needed good luck, boldness, and\r\n    skill. These three conditions were not lacking to our seamen;\r\n    but then, what chiefs and what captains they had!\"[39]\r\n\r\nThe English historian, on the other hand, while admitting how severely\r\nthe people and commerce of England suffered from the cruisers,\r\nbitterly reflecting at times upon the administration, yet refers over\r\nand over again to the increasing prosperity of the whole country, and\r\nespecially of its commercial part. In the preceding war, on the\r\ncontrary, from 1689 to 1697, when France sent great fleets to sea and\r\ndisputed the supremacy of the ocean, how different the result! The\r\nsame English writer says of that time:--\r\n\r\n    \"With respect to our trade it is certain that we suffered\r\n    infinitely more, not merely than the French, for that was to be\r\n    expected from the greater number of our merchant-ships, but than\r\n    we ever did in any former war.... This proceeded in great\r\n    measure from the vigilance of the French, who carried on the war\r\n    in a piratical way. It is out of all doubt that, taking all\r\n    together, our traffic suffered excessively; our merchants were\r\n    many of them ruined.\"[40]\r\n\r\nMacaulay says of this period: \"During many months of 1693 the English\r\ntrade with the Mediterranean had been interrupted almost entirely.\r\nThere was no chance that a merchantman from London or Amsterdam would,\r\nif unprotected, reach the Pillars of Hercules without being boarded by\r\na French privateer; and the protection of armed vessels was not easily\r\nobtained.\" Why? Because the vessels of England's navy were occupied\r\nwatching the French navy, and this diversion of them from the cruisers\r\nand privateers constituted the support which a commerce-destroying war\r\nmust have. A French historian, speaking of the same period in England\r\n(1696), says: \"The state of the finances was deplorable; money was\r\nscarce, maritime insurance thirty per cent, the Navigation Act was\r\nvirtually suspended, and the English shipping reduced to the necessity\r\nof sailing under the Swedish and Danish flags.\"[41] Half a century\r\nlater the French government was again reduced, by long neglect of the\r\nnavy, to a cruising warfare. With what results? First, the French\r\nhistorian says: \"From June, 1756, to June, 1760, French privateers\r\ncaptured from the English more than twenty-five hundred merchantmen.\r\nIn 1761, though France had not, so to speak, a single ship-of-the-line\r\nat sea, and though the English had taken two hundred and forty of our\r\nprivateers, their comrades still took eight hundred and twelve\r\nvessels. But,\" he goes on to say, \"the prodigious growth of the\r\nEnglish shipping explains the number of these prizes.\"[42] In other\r\nwords, the suffering involved to England in such numerous captures,\r\nwhich must have caused great individual injury and discontent, did not\r\nreally prevent the growing prosperity of the State and of the\r\ncommunity at large. The English naval historian, speaking of the same\r\nperiod, says: \"While the commerce of France was nearly destroyed, the\r\ntrading-fleet of England covered the seas. Every year her commerce was\r\nincreasing; the money which the war carried out was returned by the\r\nproduce of her industry. Eight thousand merchant vessels were employed\r\nby the English merchants.\" And again, summing up the results of the\r\nwar, after stating the immense amount of specie brought into the\r\nkingdom by foreign conquests, he says: \"The trade of England increased\r\ngradually every year, and such a scene of national prosperity, while\r\nwaging a long, bloody, and costly war, was never before shown by any\r\npeople in the world.\" On the other hand, the historian of the French\r\nnavy, speaking of an earlier phase of the same wars, says: \"The\r\nEnglish fleets, having nothing to resist them, swept the seas. Our\r\nprivateers and single cruisers, having no fleet to keep down the\r\nabundance of their enemies, ran short careers. Twenty thousand French\r\nseamen lay in English prisons.\"[43] When, on the other hand, in the\r\nWar of the American Revolution France resumed the policy of Colbert\r\nand of the early reign of Louis XIV., and kept large battle-fleets\r\nafloat, the same result again followed as in the days of Tourville.\r\n\"For the first time,\" says the Annual Register, forgetting or ignorant\r\nof the experience of 1693, and remembering only the glories of the\r\nlater wars, \"English merchant-ships were driven to take refuge under\r\nforeign flags.\"[44] Finally, in quitting this part of the subject, it\r\nmay be remarked that in the island of Martinique the French had a\r\npowerful distant dependency upon which to base a cruising warfare; and\r\nduring the Seven Years' War, as afterward during the First Empire, it,\r\nwith Guadeloupe, was the refuge of numerous privateers. \"The records\r\nof the English admiralty raise the losses of the English in the West\r\nIndies during the first years of the Seven Years' War to fourteen\r\nhundred merchantmen taken or destroyed.\" The English fleet was\r\ntherefore directed against the islands, both of which fell, involving\r\na loss to the trade of France greater than all the depredations of her\r\ncruisers on the English commerce, besides breaking up the system; but\r\nin the war of 1778 the great fleets protected the islands, which were\r\nnot even threatened at any time.\r\n\r\nSo far we have been viewing the effect of a purely cruising warfare,\r\nnot based upon powerful squadrons, only upon that particular part of\r\nthe enemy's strength against which it is theoretically directed,--upon\r\nhis commerce and general wealth; upon the sinews of war. The evidence\r\nseems to show that even for its own special ends such a mode of war is\r\ninconclusive, worrying but not deadly; it might almost be said that it\r\ncauses needless suffering. What, however, is the effect of this policy\r\nupon the general ends of the war, to which it is one of the means, and\r\nto which it is subsidiary? How, again, does it react upon the people\r\nthat practise it? As the historical evidences will come up in detail\r\nfrom time to time, it need here only be summarized. The result to\r\nEngland in the days of Charles II. has been seen,--her coast insulted,\r\nher shipping burned almost within sight of her capital. In the War of\r\nthe Spanish Succession, when the control of Spain was the military\r\nobject, while the French depended upon a cruising war against\r\ncommerce, the navies of England and Holland, unopposed, guarded the\r\ncoasts of the peninsula, blocked the port of Toulon, forced the French\r\nsuccors to cross the Pyrenees, and by keeping open the sea highway,\r\nneutralized the geographical nearness of France to the seat of war.\r\nTheir fleets seized Gibraltar, Barcelona, and Minorca, and\r\nco-operating with the Austrian army failed by little of reducing\r\nToulon. In the Seven Years' War the English fleets seized, or aided in\r\nseizing, all the most valuable colonies of France and Spain, and made\r\nfrequent descents on the French coast. The War of the American\r\nRevolution affords no lesson, the fleets being nearly equal. The next\r\nmost striking instance to Americans is the War of 1812. Everybody\r\nknows how our privateers swarmed over the seas, and that from the\r\nsmallness of our navy the war was essentially, indeed solely, a\r\ncruising war. Except upon the lakes, it is doubtful if more than two\r\nof our ships at any time acted together. The injury done to English\r\ncommerce, thus unexpectedly attacked by a distant foe which had been\r\nundervalued, may be fully conceded; but on the one hand, the American\r\ncruisers were powerfully supported by the French fleet, which being\r\nassembled in larger or smaller bodies in the many ports under the\r\nemperor's control from Antwerp to Venice, tied the fleets of England\r\nto blockade duty; and on the other hand, when the fall of the emperor\r\nreleased them, our coasts were insulted in every direction, the\r\nChesapeake entered and controlled, its shores wasted, the Potomac\r\nascended, and Washington burned. The Northern frontier was kept in a\r\nstate of alarm, though there squadrons, absolutely weak but relatively\r\nstrong, sustained the general defence; while in the South the\r\nMississippi was entered unopposed, and New Orleans barely saved. When\r\nnegotiations for peace were opened, the bearing of the English toward\r\nthe American envoys was not that of men who felt their country to be\r\nthreatened with an unbearable evil. The late Civil War, with the\r\ncruises of the \"Alabama\" and \"Sumter\" and their consorts, revived the\r\ntradition of commerce-destroying. In so far as this is one means to a\r\ngeneral end, and is based upon a navy otherwise powerful, it is well;\r\nbut we need not expect to see the feats of those ships repeated in the\r\nface of a great sea power. In the first place, those cruises were\r\npowerfully supported by the determination of the United States to\r\nblockade, not only the chief centres of Southern trade, but every\r\ninlet of the coast, thus leaving few ships available for pursuit; in\r\nthe second place, had there been ten of those cruisers where there was\r\none, they would not have stopped the incursion in Southern waters of\r\nthe Union fleet, which penetrated to every point accessible from the\r\nsea; and in the third place, the undeniable injury, direct and\r\nindirect, inflicted upon individuals and upon one branch of the\r\nnation's industry (and how high that shipping industry stands in the\r\nwriter's estimation need not be repeated), did not in the least\r\ninfluence or retard the event of the war. Such injuries, unaccompanied\r\nby others, are more irritating than weakening. On the other hand, will\r\nany refuse to admit that the work of the great Union fleets powerfully\r\nmodified and hastened an end which was probably inevitable in any\r\ncase? As a sea power the South then occupied the place of France in\r\nthe wars we have been considering, while the situation of the North\r\nresembled that of England; and, as in France, the sufferers in the\r\nConfederacy were not a class, but the government and the nation at\r\nlarge. It is not the taking of individual ships or convoys, be they\r\nfew or many, that strikes down the money power of a nation; it is the\r\npossession of that overbearing power on the sea which drives the\r\nenemy's flag from it, or allows it to appear only as a fugitive; and\r\nwhich, by controlling the great common, closes the highways by which\r\ncommerce moves to and from the enemy's shores. This overbearing power\r\ncan only be exercised by great navies, and by them (on the broad sea)\r\nless efficiently now than in the days when the neutral flag had not\r\nits present immunity. It is not unlikely that, in the event of a war\r\nbetween maritime nations, an attempt may be made by the one having a\r\ngreat sea power and wishing to break down its enemy's commerce, to\r\ninterpret the phrase \"effective blockade\" in the manner that best\r\nsuits its interests at the time; to assert that the speed and disposal\r\nof its ships make the blockade effective at much greater distances and\r\nwith fewer ships than formerly. The determination of such a question\r\nwill depend, not upon the weaker belligerent, but upon neutral powers;\r\nit will raise the issue between belligerent and neutral rights; and if\r\nthe belligerent have a vastly overpowering navy he may carry his\r\npoint, just as England, when possessing the mastery of the seas, long\r\nrefused to admit the doctrine of the neutral flag covering the goods.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] Davies: History of Holland.\r\n\r\n[17] République d'Angleterre.\r\n\r\n[18] Lefèvre-Pontalis: Jean de Witt.\r\n\r\n[19] Martin: History of France.\r\n\r\n[20] Gougeard: Marine de Guerre.\r\n\r\n[21] Since the above was written, the experience of the English autumn\r\nmanoeuvres of 1888 has verified this statement; not indeed that any\r\nsuch experiment was needed to establish a self-evident fact.\r\n\r\n[22] Chabaud-Arnault: Revue Mar. et Col. 1885.\r\n\r\n[23] The recent development of rapid-firing and machine guns, with the\r\ngreat increase of their calibre and consequent range and penetration,\r\nreproduces this same step in the cycle of progress.\r\n\r\n[24] Gougeard: Marine de Guerre.\r\n\r\n[25] Vol. lxxxii. p. 137.\r\n\r\n[26] Mémoires du Cte. de Guiche.

At the same time that his armies moved forward, he sent\r\nout a State paper setting forth his claims upon the territories in\r\nquestion. This paper showed unmistakably the ambitious character of\r\nthe young king, roused the anxiety of Europe, and doubtless increased\r\nthe strength of the peace party in England. Under the leadership of\r\nHolland, but with the hearty co-operation of the English minister, an\r\nalliance was formed between the two countries and Sweden, hitherto the\r\nfriend of France, to check Louis' advance before his power became too\r\ngreat. The attack first on the Netherlands in 1667, and then on\r\nFranche Comté in 1668, showed the hopeless weakness of Spain to defend\r\nher possessions; they fell almost without a blow.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United Provinces, relative to the claims of Louis at\r\nthis time, was summed up in the phrase that \"France was good as a\r\nfriend, but not as a neighbor.\" They were unwilling to break their\r\ntraditional alliance, but still more unwilling to have her on their\r\nborder. The policy of the English people, though not of their king,\r\nturned toward the Dutch. In the increased greatness of Louis they saw\r\ndanger to all Europe; to themselves more especially if, by a settled\r\npreponderance on the continent, his hands were free to develop his sea\r\npower. \"Flanders once in the power of Louis XIV.,\" wrote the English\r\nambassador Temple, \"the Dutch feel that their country will be only a\r\nmaritime province of France;\" and sharing that opinion, \"he advocated\r\nthe policy of resistance to the latter country, whose domination in\r\nthe Low Countries he considered as a threatened subjection of all\r\nEurope. He never ceased to represent to his government how dangerous\r\nto England would be the conquest of the sea provinces by France, and\r\nhe urgently pointed out the need of a prompt understanding with the\r\nDutch. 'This would be the best revenge,' said he, 'for the trick\r\nFrance has played us in involving us in the last war with the United\r\nProvinces.'\" These considerations brought the two countries together\r\nin that Triple Alliance with Sweden which has been mentioned, and\r\nwhich for a time checked the onward movement of Louis. But the wars\r\nbetween the two sea nations were too recent, the humiliation of\r\nEngland in the Thames too bitter, and the rivalries that still existed\r\ntoo real, too deeply seated in the nature of things, to make that\r\nalliance durable. It needed the dangerous power of Louis, and his\r\npersistence in a course threatening to both, to weld the union of\r\nthese natural antagonists. This was not to be done without another\r\nbloody encounter.\r\n\r\nLouis was deeply angered at the Triple Alliance, and his wrath was\r\nturned mainly upon Holland, in which from the necessities of her\r\nposition he recognized his most steadfast opponent. For the time,\r\nhowever, he seemed to yield; the more readily because of the probable\r\napproaching failure of the Spanish royal line, and the ambition he had\r\nof getting more than merely the territory lying to the east of France,\r\nwhen the throne became vacant. But, though he dissembled and yielded,\r\nfrom that time he set his mind upon the destruction of the republic.\r\nThis policy was directly contrary to that laid down by Richelieu, and\r\nto the true welfare of France. It was to England's interest, at least\r\njust then, that the United Provinces should not be trodden down by\r\nFrance; but it was much more to the interest of France that they\r\nshould not be subjected to England. England, free from the continent,\r\nmight stand alone upon the seas contending with France; but France,\r\nhampered by her continental politics, could not hope to wrest the\r\ncontrol of the seas from England without an ally. This ally Louis\r\nproposed to destroy, and he asked England to help him. The final\r\nresult is already known, but the outlines of the contest must now be\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nBefore the royal purpose had passed into action, and while there was\r\nstill time to turn the energies of France into another channel, a\r\ndifferent course was proposed to the king. This was the project of\r\nLeibnitz, before spoken of, which has special interest for our subject\r\nbecause, in proposing to reverse the lines which Louis then laid down,\r\nto make continental expansion secondary and growth beyond the sea the\r\nprimary object of France, the tendency avowedly and necessarily was to\r\nbase the greatness of the country upon the control of the sea and of\r\ncommerce. The immediate object offered to the France of that day, with\r\nthe attainment of which, however, she could not have stopped short,\r\nwas the conquest of Egypt; that country which, facing both the\r\nMediterranean and Eastern seas, gave control of the great commercial\r\nroute which in our own day has been completed by the Suez Canal. That\r\nroute had lost much of its value by the discovery of the way round the\r\nCape of Good Hope, and yet more by the unsettled and piratical\r\nconditions of the seas through which it lay; but with a really strong\r\nnaval power occupying the key of the position it might have been\r\nlargely restored. Such a power posted in Egypt would, in the already\r\ndecaying condition of the Ottoman Empire, have controlled the trade\r\nnot only of India and the far East, but also of the Levant; but the\r\nenterprise could not have stopped there. The necessity of mastering\r\nthe Mediterranean and opening the Red Sea, closed to Christian vessels\r\nby Mohammedan bigotry, would have compelled the occupation of stations\r\non either side of Egypt; and France would have been led step by step,\r\nas England has been led by the possession of India, to the seizure of\r\npoints like Malta, Cyprus, Aden, in short, to a great sea power. That\r\nis clear now; but it will be interesting to hear the arguments by\r\nwhich Leibnitz sought to convince the French king two hundred years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nAfter pointing out the weakness of the Turkish Empire, and the\r\nreadiness with which it might be further embarrassed by stirring up\r\nAustria and Poland, the latter the traditional ally of France; after\r\nshowing that France had no armed enemy in the Mediterranean, and that\r\non the other side of Egypt she would meet the Portuguese colonies,\r\nlonging to obtain protection against the Dutch in India, the memorial\r\nproceeds:--\r\n\r\n    \"The conquest of Egypt, that Holland of the East, is infinitely\r\n    easier than that of the United Provinces. France needs peace in\r\n    the west, war at a distance. War with Holland will probably ruin\r\n    the new Indian companies as well as the colonies and commerce\r\n    lately revived by France, and will increase the burdens of the\r\n    people while diminishing their resources. The Dutch will retire\r\n    into their maritime towns, stand there on the defensive in\r\n    perfect safety, and assume the offensive on the sea with great\r\n    chance of success. If France does not obtain a complete victory\r\n    over them, she loses all her influence in Europe, and by victory\r\n    she endangers that influence. In Egypt, on the contrary, a\r\n    repulse, almost impossible, will be of no great consequence, and\r\n    victory will give the dominion of the seas, the commerce of the\r\n    East and of India, the preponderance in Christendom, and even\r\n    the empire of the East on the ruins of the Ottoman power. The\r\n    possession of Egypt opens the way to conquests worthy of\r\n    Alexander; the extreme weakness of the Orientals is no longer a\r\n    secret. Whoever has Egypt will have all the coasts and islands\r\n    of the Indian Ocean. It is in Egypt that Holland will be\r\n    conquered; it is there she will be despoiled of what alone\r\n    renders her prosperous, the treasures of the East. She will be\r\n    struck without being able to ward off the blow. Should she wish\r\n    to oppose the designs of France upon Egypt, she would be\r\n    overwhelmed with the universal hatred of Christians; attacked at\r\n    home, on the contrary, not only could she ward off the\r\n    aggression, but she could avenge herself sustained by universal\r\n    public opinion, which suspects the views of France of\r\n    ambition.\"[45]\r\n\r\nThe memorial had no effect. \"All that the efforts of ambition and\r\nhuman prudence could do to lay the foundations for the destruction of\r\na nation, Louis XIV. now did. Diplomatic strategy on a vast scale was\r\ndisplayed in order to isolate and hem in Holland. Louis, who had been\r\nunable to make Europe accept the conquest of Belgium by France, now\r\nhoped to induce it to see without trembling the fall of Holland.\" His\r\nefforts were in the main successful. The Triple Alliance was broken;\r\nthe King of England, though contrary to the wishes of his people, made\r\nan offensive alliance with Louis; and Holland, when the war began,\r\nfound herself without an ally in Europe, except the worn-out kingdom\r\nof Spain and the Elector of Brandenburg, then by no means a\r\nfirst-class State. But in order to obtain the help of Charles II.,\r\nLouis not only engaged to pay him large sums of money, but also to\r\ngive to England, from the spoils of Holland and Belgium, Walcheren,\r\nSluys, and Cadsand, and even the islands of Goree and Voorn; the\r\ncontrol, that is, of the mouths of the great commercial rivers the\r\nScheldt and the Meuse. With regard to the united fleets of the two\r\nnations, it was agreed that the officer bearing the admiral's flag of\r\nEngland should command in chief. The question of naval precedence was\r\nreserved, by not sending the admiral of France afloat; but it was\r\npractically yielded. It is evident that in his eagerness for the ruin\r\nof Holland and his own continental aggrandizement Louis was playing\r\ndirectly into England's hand, as to power on the sea. A French\r\nhistorian is justified in saying: \"These negotiations have been\r\nwrongly judged. It has been often repeated that Charles sold England\r\nto Louis XIV. This is true only of internal policy. Charles indeed\r\nplotted the political and religious subjugation of England with the\r\nhelp of a foreign power; but as to external interests, he did not sell\r\nthem, for the greater share in the profit from the ruin of the Dutch\r\nwas to go to England.\"[46]\r\n\r\nDuring the years preceding the war the Dutch made every diplomatic\r\neffort to avert it, but the hatred of Charles and Louis prevented any\r\nconcession being accepted as final. An English royal yacht was ordered\r\nto pass through the Dutch ships-of-war in the Channel, and to fire on\r\nthem if they did not strike their flags. In January, 1672, England\r\nsent an ultimatum, summoning Holland to acknowledge the right of the\r\nEnglish crown to the sovereignty of the British seas, and to order its\r\nfleets to lower their flags to the smallest English man-of-war; and\r\ndemands such as these received the support of a French king. The Dutch\r\ncontinued to yield, but seeing at length that all concessions were\r\nuseless, they in February ordered into commission seventy-five\r\nships-of-the-line, besides smaller vessels. On the 23d of March the\r\nEnglish, without declaration of war, attacked a fleet of Dutch\r\nmerchantmen; and on the 29th the king declared war. This was followed,\r\nApril 6th, by the declaration of Louis XIV.; and on the 28th of the\r\nsame month he set out to take command in person of his army.\r\n\r\nThe war which now began, including the third and last of the great\r\ncontests between the English and Dutch upon the ocean, was not, like\r\nthose before it, purely a sea war; and it will be necessary to mention\r\nits leading outlines on the land also, not only in order to clearness\r\nof impression, but also to bring out the desperate straits to which\r\nthe republic was reduced, and the final deliverance through its sea\r\npower in the hands of the great seaman De Ruyter.\r\n\r\nThe naval war differs from those that preceded it in more than one\r\nrespect; but its most distinctive feature is that the Dutch, except on\r\none occasion at the very beginning, did not send out their fleet to\r\nmeet the enemy, but made what may properly be called a strategic use\r\nof their dangerous coast and shoals, upon which were based their sea\r\noperations. To this course they were forced by the desperate odds\r\nunder which they were fighting; but they did not use their shoals as a\r\nmere shelter,--the warfare they waged was the defensive-offensive.\r\nWhen the wind was fair for the allies to attack, Ruyter kept under\r\ncover of his islands, or at least on ground where the enemy dared not\r\nfollow; but when the wind served so that he might attack in his own\r\nway, he turned and fell upon them. There are also apparent indications\r\nof tactical combinations, on his part, of a higher order than have\r\nyet been met; though it is possible that the particular acts referred\r\nto, consisting in partial attacks amounting to little more than\r\ndemonstrations against the French contingent, may have sprung from\r\npolitical motives. This solution for the undoubted fact that the Dutch\r\nattacked the French lightly has not been met with elsewhere by the\r\nwriter; but it seems possible that the rulers of the United Provinces\r\nmay have wished not to increase the exasperation of their most\r\ndangerous enemy by humiliating his fleet, and so making it less easy\r\nto his pride to accept their offers. There is, however, an equally\r\nsatisfactory military explanation in the supposition that, the French\r\nbeing yet inexperienced, Ruyter thought it only necessary to contain\r\nthem while falling in force upon the English. The latter fought\r\nthroughout with their old gallantry, but less than their old\r\ndiscipline; whereas the attacks of the Dutch were made with a\r\nsustained and unanimous vigor that showed a great military advance.\r\nThe action of the French was at times suspicious; it has been alleged\r\nthat Louis ordered his admiral to economize his fleet, and there is\r\ngood reason to believe that toward the end of the two years that\r\nEngland remained in his alliance he did do so.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of the United Provinces, knowing that the French fleet\r\nat Brest was to join the English in the Thames, made great exertions\r\nto fit out their squadron so as to attack the latter before the\r\njunction was made; but the wretched lack of centralization in their\r\nnaval administration caused this project to fail. The province of\r\nZealand was so backward that its contingent, a large fraction of the\r\nwhole, was not ready in time; and it has been charged that the delay\r\nwas due, not merely to mismanagement, but to disaffection to the party\r\nin control of the government. A blow at the English fleet in its own\r\nwaters, by a superior force, before its ally arrived, was a correct\r\nmilitary conception; judging from the after-history of this war, it\r\nmight well have produced a profound effect upon the whole course of\r\nthe struggle. Ruyter finally got to sea and fell in with the allied\r\nfleets, but though fully intending to fight, fell back before them to\r\nhis own coast. The allies did not follow him there, but retired,\r\napparently in full security, to Southwold Bay, on the east coast of\r\nEngland, some ninety miles north of the mouth of the Thames. There\r\nthey anchored in three divisions,--two English, the rear and centre of\r\nthe allied line, to the northward, and the van, composed of French\r\nships, to the southward. Ruyter followed them, and on the early\r\nmorning of June 7, 1672, the Dutch fleet was signalled by a French\r\nlookout frigate in the northward and eastward; standing down before a\r\nnortheast wind for the allied fleet, from which a large number of\r\nboats and men were ashore in watering parties. The Dutch order of\r\nbattle was in two lines, the advanced one containing eighteen ships\r\nwith fire-ships (Plate III., A). Their total force was ninety-one\r\nships-of-the-line; that of the allies one hundred and one.\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing toward the coast, which here trends nearly north\r\nand south, and the allies were in an awkward position. They had first\r\nto get under way, and they could not fall back to gain time or room to\r\nestablish their order. Most of the ships cut their cables, and the\r\nEnglish made sail on the starboard tack, heading about north-northwest,\r\na course which forced them soon to go about; whereas the French took\r\nthe other tack (Plate III., B). The battle began therefore by the\r\nseparation of the allied fleet. Ruyter sent one division to attack the\r\nFrench, or rather to contain them; for these opponents exchanged only a\r\ndistant cannonade, although the Dutch, being to windward, had the\r\nchoice of closer action if they wished it. As their commander, Bankert,\r\nwas not censured, it may be supposed he acted under orders; and he was\r\ncertainly in command a year later, and acting with great judgment and\r\ngallantry at the battle of the Texel. Meanwhile Ruyter fell furiously\r\nupon the two English divisions, and apparently with superior forces;\r\nfor the English naval historians claim that the Dutch were in the\r\nproportion of three to two.[47] If this can be accepted, it gives a\r\nmarked evidence of Ruyter's high qualities as a general officer, in\r\nadvance of any other who appears in this century.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. III.]\r\n\r\nThe results of the battle, considered simply as an engagement, were\r\nindecisive; both sides lost heavily, but the honors and the substantial\r\nadvantages all belonged to the Dutch, or rather to De Ruyter. He had\r\noutgeneralled the allies by his apparent retreat, and then returning\r\nhad surprised them wholly unprepared. The false move by which the\r\nEnglish, two thirds of the whole, stood to the northward and westward,\r\nwhile the other third, the French, went off to the east and south,\r\nseparated the allied fleet; Ruyter threw his whole force into the gap,\r\nshowing front to the French with a division probably smaller in\r\nnumbers, but which, from its position to windward, had the choice of\r\ncoming to close action or not, while with the remainder he fell in much\r\nsuperior strength upon the English (Plate III., B). Paul Hoste says[48]\r\nthat Vice-Admiral d'Estrées, commanding the French, had taken measures\r\nfor tacking and breaking through the Dutch division opposed to him so\r\nas to rejoin the Duke of York, the allied commander-in-chief. It may be\r\nso, for D'Estrées was a very brave man, and not enough of a seaman to\r\nappreciate the dangers of the attempt; but no such move was begun, and\r\nboth the English and Ruyter thought that the French rather avoided than\r\nsought close action. Had D'Estrées, however, gone about, and attempted\r\nto break through the line of experienced Dutchmen to windward of him\r\nwith the still raw seamen of France, the result would have been as\r\ndisastrous as that which overtook the Spanish admiral at the battle of\r\nSt. Vincent a hundred and twenty-five years later, when he tried to\r\nreunite his broken fleet by breaking through the close order of Jervis\r\nand Nelson. (See Plate III., a.) The truth, which gradually dawns\r\nthrough a mass of conflicting statements, is, that the Duke of York,\r\nthough a fair seaman and a brave man, was not an able one; that his\r\nfleet was not in good order and was thus surprised; that his orders\r\nbeforehand were not so precise as to make the French admiral\r\ntechnically disobedient in taking the opposite tack from the\r\ncommander-in-chief, and so separating the squadrons; and that Ruyter\r\nprofited most ably by the surprise which he had himself prepared, and\r\nby the further opportunity given him by the ineptness of his enemies.\r\nUnless for circumstances that are not stated, the French admiral took\r\nthe right tack, with a northeast wind, for it led out to sea and would\r\ngive room for manoeuvring; had the Duke of York chosen the same, the\r\nallied fleet would have gone out together, with only the disadvantage\r\nof the wind and bad order. In that case, however, Ruyter could, and\r\nprobably would, have done just what he did at the Texel a year\r\nlater,--check the van, the French, with a small containing force, and\r\nfall with the mass of his fleet upon the centre and rear. It is the\r\nsimilarity of his action in both cases, under very different\r\nconditions, that proves he intended at Southwold Bay merely to keep the\r\nFrench in check while he destroyed the English.\r\n\r\nIn this battle, called indifferently Southwold Bay and Solebay, Ruyter\r\nshowed a degree of skill combined with vigor which did not appear upon\r\nthe sea, after his death, until the days of Suffren and Nelson. His\r\nbattles of the war of 1672 were no \"affairs of circumspection,\" though\r\nthey were fought circumspectly; his aim was no less than the enemy's\r\ntotal overthrow, by joining good combinations to fury of attack. At\r\nSolebay he was somewhat, though not greatly, inferior to his enemies;\r\nafterward much more so.\r\n\r\nThe substantial results of Solebay fight were wholly favorable to the\r\nDutch. The allied fleets were to have assisted the operations of the\r\nFrench army by making a descent upon the coast of Zealand. Ruyter's\r\nattack had inflicted an amount of damage, and caused an expenditure of\r\nammunition, which postponed the sailing of the fleet for a month; it\r\nwas a diversion, not only important, but vital in the nearly desperate\r\ncondition to which the United Provinces were reduced ashore. It may be\r\nadded, as an instructive comment on the theory of commerce-destroying,\r\nthat after this staggering check to the enemy's superior forces,\r\nRuyter met and convoyed safely to port a fleet of Dutch merchantmen.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the land campaign must now be briefly described.[49]\r\nEarly in May the French army in several corps moved forward, passing\r\nthrough the outskirts of the Spanish Netherlands, and directing their\r\nattack upon Holland from the south and east. The republican party\r\nwhich was in power in Holland had neglected the army, and now made the\r\nmistake of scattering the force they had among many fortified towns,\r\ntrusting that each would do something toward delaying the French.\r\nLouis, however, under the advice of Turenne, simply observed the more\r\nimportant places, while the second-rate towns surrendered nearly as\r\nfast as they were summoned; the army of the Provinces, as well as\r\ntheir territory, thus passing rapidly, by fractions, into the power of\r\nthe enemy. Within a month the French were in the heart of the country,\r\nhaving carried all before them, and with no organized force remaining\r\nin their front sufficient of itself to stop them. In the fortnight\r\nfollowing the battle of Solebay, terror and disorganization spread\r\nthroughout the republic. On the 15th of June the Grand Pensionary\r\nobtained permission of the States-General to send a deputation to\r\nLouis XIV., begging him to name the terms on which he would grant them\r\npeace; any humiliation to the foreigner was better in the eyes of the\r\npolitician than to see the opposite party, the House of Orange, come\r\ninto power on his downfall. While negotiations were pending, the Dutch\r\ntowns continued to surrender; and on the 20th of June a few French\r\nsoldiers entered Muyden, the key to Amsterdam. They were only\r\nstragglers, though the large body to which they belonged was near at\r\nhand; and the burghers, who had admitted them under the influence of\r\nthe panic prevailing throughout the land, seeing that they were alone,\r\nsoon made them drunk and put them out. The nobler feeling that\r\nanimated Amsterdam now made itself felt in Muyden; a body of troops\r\nhurried up from the capital, and the smaller city was saved.\r\n\"Situated on the Zuyder Zee, two hours distant from Amsterdam, at the\r\njunction of a number of rivers and canals, Muyden not only held the\r\nkey of the principal dykes by which Amsterdam could surround herself\r\nwith a protecting inundation, it also held the key of the harbor of\r\nthis great city, all the ships which went from the North Sea to\r\nAmsterdam by the Zuyder Zee being obliged to pass under its guns.\r\nMuyden saved and its dykes open, Amsterdam had time to breathe, and\r\nremained free to break off her communications by land and to maintain\r\nthem by sea.\"[50] It was the turning-point of the invasion; but what\r\nwould have been the effect upon the spirit of the Dutch, oppressed by\r\ndefeat and distracted in council, if in that fateful fortnight which\r\nwent before, the allied fleet had attacked their coasts? From this\r\nthey were saved by the battle of Solebay.\r\n\r\nNegotiations continued. The burgomasters--the party representing\r\nwealth and commerce--favored submission; they shrank from the\r\ndestruction of their property and trade. New advances were made; but\r\nwhile the envoys were still in the camp of Louis, the populace and the\r\nOrange party rose, and with them the spirit of resistance. On the 25th\r\nof June Amsterdam opened the dykes, and her example was followed by\r\nthe other cities of Holland; immense loss was entailed, but the\r\nflooded country and the cities contained therein, standing like\r\nislands amid the waters, were safe from attack by land forces until\r\nfreezing weather. The revolution continued. William of Orange,\r\nafterward William III. of England, was on the 8th of July made\r\nstadtholder, and head of the army and navy; and the two De Witts, the\r\nheads of the republican party, were murdered by a mob a few weeks\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe resistance born of popular enthusiasm and pride of country was\r\nstrengthened by the excessive demands of Louis XIV. It was plain that\r\nthe Provinces must conquer or be destroyed. Meanwhile the other States\r\nof Europe were waking up to the danger, and the Emperor of Germany,\r\nthe Elector of Brandenburg, and the King of Spain declared for\r\nHolland; while Sweden, though nominally in alliance with France, was\r\nunwilling to see the destruction of the Provinces, because that would\r\nbe to the advantage of England's sea power. Nevertheless the next\r\nyear, 1673, opened with promise for France, and the English king was\r\nprepared to fulfil his part of the compact on the seas; but the Dutch,\r\nunder the firm leadership of William of Orange, and with their hold on\r\nthe sea unshaken, now refused to accept conditions of peace which had\r\nbeen offered by themselves the year before.\r\n\r\nThree naval battles were fought in 1673, all near the coast of the\r\nUnited Provinces; the first two, June 7 and June 14, off Schoneveldt,\r\nfrom which place they have taken their name; the third, known as the\r\nbattle of the Texel, August 21. In all three Ruyter attacked, choosing\r\nhis own time, and retiring when it suited him to the protection of his\r\nown shores. For the allies to carry out their objects and make any\r\ndiversion upon the seaboard, or on the other hand to cripple the sea\r\nresources of the hard-pressed Provinces, it was necessary first to\r\ndeal successfully with Ruyter's fleet. The great admiral and his\r\ngovernment both felt this, and took the resolution that \"the fleet\r\nshould be posted in the passage of Schoneveldt, or a little farther\r\nsouth toward Ostend, to observe the enemy, and if attacked, or seeing\r\nthe enemy's fleet disposed to make a descent upon the shores of the\r\nUnited Provinces, should resist vigorously, by opposing his designs\r\nand destroying his ships.\"[51] From this position, with good lookouts,\r\nany movement of the allies would be known.\r\n\r\nThe English and French put to sea about the 1st of June, under the\r\ncommand of Prince Rupert, first cousin to the king, the Duke of York\r\nhaving been obliged to resign his office on account of the passage of\r\nthe Test Act, directed against persons of the Roman Catholic faith\r\nholding any public employment. The French were under Vice-Admiral\r\nd'Estrées, the same who had commanded them at Solebay. A force of six\r\nthousand English troops at Yarmouth was ready to embark if De Ruyter\r\nwas worsted. On the 7th of June the Dutch were made out, riding within\r\nthe sands at Schoneveldt. A detached squadron was sent to draw them\r\nout, but Ruyter needed no invitation; the wind served, and he followed\r\nthe detached squadron with such impetuosity as to attack before the\r\nallied line was fairly formed. On this occasion the French occupied\r\nthe centre. The affair was indecisive, if a battle can be called so in\r\nwhich an inferior force attacks a superior, inflicts an equal loss,\r\nand frustrates the main object of the enemy. A week later Ruyter again\r\nattacked, with results which, though indecisive as before as to the\r\nparticular action, forced the allied fleet to return to the English\r\ncoast to refit, and for supplies. The Dutch in these encounters had\r\nfifty-five ships-of-the-line; their enemies eighty-one, fifty-four of\r\nwhich were English.\r\n\r\nThe allied fleets did not go to sea again until the latter part of\r\nJuly, and this time they carried with them a body of troops meant for\r\na landing. On the 20th of August the Dutch fleet was seen under way\r\nbetween the Texel and the Meuse. Rupert at once got ready to fight;\r\nbut as the wind was from the northward and westward, giving the allies\r\nthe weather-gage, and with it the choice of the method of attack,\r\nRuyter availed himself of his local knowledge, keeping so close to the\r\nbeach that the enemy dared not approach,--the more so as it was late\r\nin the day. During the night the wind shifted to east-southeast off\r\nthe land, and at daybreak, to use the words of a French official\r\nnarrative, the Dutch \"made all sail and stood down boldly into\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\nThe allied fleet was to leeward on the port tack, heading about\r\nsouth,--the French in the van, Rupert in the centre, and Sir Edward\r\nSpragge commanding the rear. De Ruyter divided his fleet into three\r\nsquadrons, the leading one of which, of ten or twelve ships only, he\r\nsent against the French; while with the rest of his force he attacked\r\nthe English in the centre and rear (Plate IV., A, A', A''). If we\r\naccept the English estimate of the forces, which gives the English\r\nsixty ships, the French thirty, and the Dutch seventy, Ruyter's plan\r\nof attack, by simply holding the French in check as at Solebay,\r\nallowed him to engage the English on equal terms. The battle took on\r\nseveral distinct phases, which it is instructive to follow. M. de\r\nMartel, commanding the van of the French, and consequently the leading\r\nsubdivision of the allied fleet, was ordered to stretch ahead, go\r\nabout and gain to windward of the Dutch van, so as to place it between\r\ntwo fires. This he did (B); but as soon as Bankert--the same who had\r\nmanoeuvred so judiciously at Solebay the year before--saw the danger,\r\nhe put his helm up and ran through the remaining twenty ships of\r\nD'Estrées' squadron with his own twelve (C),--a feat as creditable to\r\nhim as it was discreditable to the French; and then wearing round\r\nstood down to De Ruyter, who was hotly engaged with Rupert (C'). He\r\nwas not followed by D'Estrées, who suffered him to carry this\r\nimportant reinforcement to the Dutch main attack undisturbed. This\r\npractically ended the French share in the fight.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. IV. TEXEL. Aug. 21, 1673.]\r\n\r\nRupert, during his action with De Ruyter, kept off continually, with\r\nthe object of drawing the Dutch farther away from their coast, so that\r\nif the wind shifted they might not be able to regain its shelter. De\r\nRuyter followed him, and the consequent separation of the centre from\r\nthe van (B, B') was one of the reasons alleged by D'Estrées for his\r\ndelay. It does not, however, seem to have prevented Bankert from\r\njoining his chief.\r\n\r\nIn the rear an extraordinary action on the part of Sir Edward Spragge\r\nincreased the confusion in the allied fleet. For some reason this\r\nofficer considered Tromp, who commanded the Dutch rear, as his\r\npersonal antagonist, and in order to facilitate the latter's getting\r\ninto action, he hove-to (stopped) the whole English rear to wait for\r\nhim. This ill-timed point of honor on Spragge's part seems to have\r\nsprung from a promise he had made to the king that he would bring back\r\nTromp alive or dead, or else lose his own life. The stoppage, which\r\nrecalls the irresponsible and insubordinate action of the junior Dutch\r\nflag-officers in the former war, of course separated the rear (A'',\r\nB'', C''), which also drifted rapidly to leeward, Spragge and Tromp\r\ncarrying on a hot private action on their own account. These two\r\njunior admirals sought each other personally, and the battle between\r\ntheir flags was so severe that Spragge twice had to shift his own to\r\nanother ship; on the second occasion the boat in which he was embarked\r\nwas sunk by a shot, and he himself drowned.\r\n\r\nRupert, thus forsaken by his van and rear, found himself alone with\r\nRuyter (B'); who, reinforced by his van, had the address further to\r\ncut off the rear subdivision of the allied centre, and to surround the\r\nremaining twenty ships with probably thirty or forty of his own (C').\r\nIt is not creditable to the gunnery of the day that more substantial\r\nresults did not follow; but it is to be remembered that all Ruyter's\r\nskill could secure, except for probably a very short time, was an\r\naction on equal terms with the English; his total inferiority in\r\nnumbers could not be quite overcome. The damage to the English and\r\nDutch may therefore have been great, and was probably nearly equal.\r\n\r\nRupert finally disengaged himself, and seeing that the English rear\r\n(C'') was not replying well to its immediate opponents, ran down\r\ntoward it, Ruyter following him; the two opposing centres steering\r\nparallel courses, and within cannon-shot, but by mutual consent,\r\ninduced perhaps by ammunition running short, refraining from firing.\r\nAt four P.M. the centres and rears united, and toward five a fresh\r\nengagement began, which continued till seven, when Ruyter withdrew,\r\nprobably because of the approach of the French, who, by their own\r\naccounts, rejoined Rupert about that time. This ended the battle,\r\nwhich, like all that preceded it in this war, may be called a drawn\r\nfight, but as to which the verdict of the English naval historian is\r\ndoubtless correct: \"The consequences which the Dutch, through the\r\nprudence of their admiral, drew from this battle were exceedingly\r\ngreat; for they opened their ports, which were entirely blocked up,\r\nand put an end to all thoughts, by removing the possibility, of an\r\ninvasion.\"[52]\r\n\r\nThe military features of the action have sufficiently appeared in the\r\naccount that has been given,--the skill of De Ruyter; the firmness and\r\npromptness of Bankert, first in checking and then in passing through\r\nthe French division; the apparent disloyalty or, at the best,\r\ninefficiency of the latter; the insubordination and military\r\nblundering of Spragge; the seeming lack of everything but hard\r\nfighting on Rupert's part. The allies indulged in bitter mutual\r\nrecriminations. Rupert blamed both D'Estrées and Spragge; D'Estrées\r\nfound fault with Rupert for running to leeward; and D'Estrées' own\r\nsecond, Martel, roundly called his chief a coward, in a letter which\r\nearned him an imprisonment in the Bastille. The French king ordered an\r\ninquiry by the intendant of the navy at Brest, who made a report[53]\r\nupon which the account here given has mainly rested, and which leaves\r\nlittle doubt of the dishonor of the French arms in this battle. \"M.\r\nd'Estrées gave it to be understood,\" says the French naval historian,\r\n\"that the king wished his fleet spared, and that the English should\r\nnot be trusted. Was he wrong in not relying upon the sincerity of the\r\nEnglish alliance, when he was receiving from all quarters warnings\r\nthat the people and the nobles were murmuring against it, and Charles\r\nII. was perhaps alone in his kingdom in wishing it?\"[54] Possibly not;\r\nbut he was surely wrong if he wished any military man, or body of men,\r\nto play the equivocal part assigned to the French admiral on this day;\r\nthe loss of the fleet would have been a lighter disaster. So evident\r\nto eye-witnesses was the bad faith or cowardice (and the latter\r\nsupposition is not admissible), that one of the Dutch seamen, as they\r\ndiscussed among themselves why the French did not come down, said:\r\n\"You fools! they have hired the English to fight for them, and all\r\ntheir business here is to see that they earn their wages.\" A more\r\nsober-minded and significant utterance is that with which the\r\nintendant at Brest ends the official report before mentioned: \"It\r\nwould appear in all these sea-fights Ruyter has never cared to attack\r\nthe French squadron, and that in this last action he had detached ten\r\nships of the Zealand squadron to keep it in play.\"[55] No stronger\r\ntestimony is needed to Ruyter's opinion of the inefficiency or\r\nfaithlessness of that contingent to the allied forces.\r\n\r\nAnother chapter in the history of maritime coalitions was closed, on\r\nthe 21st of August, 1673, by the battle of the Texel. In it, as in\r\nothers, were amply justified the words with which a modern French\r\nnaval officer has stamped them: \"United by momentary political\r\ninterests, but at bottom divided to the verge of hatred, never\r\nfollowing the same path in counsel or in action, they have never\r\nproduced good results, or at least results proportioned to the efforts\r\nof the powers allied against a common enemy. The navies of France,\r\nSpain, and Holland seem, at several distinct times, to have joined\r\nonly to make more complete the triumph of the British arms.\"[56] When\r\nto this well-ascertained tendency of coalitions is added the equally\r\nwell known jealousy of every country over the increasing power of a\r\nneighbor, and the consequent unwillingness to see such increase\r\nobtained by crushing another member of the family of nations, an\r\napproach is made to the measure of naval strength required by a State.\r\nIt is not necessary to be able to meet all others combined, as some\r\nEnglishmen have seemed to think; it is necessary only to be able to\r\nmeet the strongest on favorable terms, sure that the others will not\r\njoin in destroying a factor in the political equilibrium, even if they\r\nhold aloof. England and Spain were allies in Toulon in 1793, when the\r\nexcesses of Revolutionary France seemed to threaten the social order\r\nof Europe; but the Spanish admiral told the English flatly that the\r\nruin of the French navy, a large part of which was there in their\r\nhands, could not fail to be injurious to the interests of Spain, and a\r\npart of the French ships was saved by his conduct, which has been\r\njustly characterized as not only full of firmness, but also as\r\ndictated by the highest political reason.[57]\r\n\r\nThe battle of the Texel, closing the long series of wars in which the\r\nDutch and English contended on equal terms for the mastery of the\r\nseas, saw the Dutch navy in its highest efficiency, and its greatest\r\nornament, De Ruyter, at the summit of his glory. Long since old in\r\nyears, for he was now sixty-six, he had lost none of his martial\r\nvigor; his attack was as furious as eight years before, and his\r\njudgment apparently had ripened rapidly through the experience of the\r\nlast war, for there is far more evidence of plan and military insight\r\nthan before. To him, under the government of the great Pensionary De\r\nWitt, with whom he was in close sympathy, the increase of discipline\r\nand sound military tone now apparent in the Dutch navy must have been\r\nlargely due. He went to this final strife of the two great sea-peoples\r\nin the fulness of his own genius, with an admirably tempered\r\ninstrument in his hands, and with the glorious disadvantage of\r\nnumbers, to save his country. The mission was fulfilled not by courage\r\nalone, but by courage, forethought, and skill. The attack at the Texel\r\nwas, in its general lines, the same as that at Trafalgar, the enemy's\r\nvan being neglected to fall on the centre and rear, and as at\r\nTrafalgar the van, by failing to do its duty, more than justified the\r\nconception; but as the odds against De Ruyter were greater than those\r\nagainst Nelson, so was his success less. The part played by Bankert at\r\nSolebay was essentially the same as that of Nelson at St. Vincent,\r\nwhen he threw himself across the path of the Spanish division with his\r\nsingle ship (see Plate III., c, c'); but Nelson took his course\r\nwithout orders from Jervis, while Bankert was carrying out Ruyter's\r\nplan. Once more, still himself in his bearing, but under sadly altered\r\nsurroundings, will this simple and heroic man come before us; and\r\nhere, in contrast with his glory, seems a proper place to insert a\r\nlittle description by the Comte de Guiche[58] of his bearing in the\r\nFour Days' Fight, which brings out at once the homely and the heroic\r\nsides of his character.\r\n\r\n    \"I never saw him [during those last three days] other than\r\n    even-tempered; and when victory was assured, saying always it\r\n    was the good God that gives it to us. Amid the disorders of the\r\n    fleet and the appearance of loss, he seemed to be moved only by\r\n    the misfortune to his country, but always submissive to the will\r\n    of God. Finally, it may be said that he has something of the\r\n    frankness and lack of polish of our patriarchs; and, to conclude\r\n    what I have to say of him, I will relate that the day after the\r\n    victory I found him sweeping his own room and feeding his\r\n    chickens.\"\r\n\r\nNine days after the battle of the Texel, on the 30th of August, 1673,\r\na formal alliance was made between Holland on the one hand, and Spain,\r\nLorraine, and the emperor of Germany on the other, and the French\r\nambassador was dismissed from Vienna. Louis almost immediately offered\r\nHolland comparatively moderate terms; but the United Provinces, with\r\ntheir new allies by their sides and with their backs borne firmly upon\r\nthe sea which had favored and supported them, set their face steadily\r\nagainst him. In England the clamor of the people and Parliament became\r\nlouder; the Protestant feeling and the old enmity to France were daily\r\ngrowing, as was the national distrust of the king. Charles, though he\r\nhad himself lost none of his hatred of the republic, had to give way.\r\nLouis, seeing the gathering storm, made up his mind, by the counsel of\r\nTurenne, to withdraw from his dangerously advanced position by\r\nevacuating Holland, and to try to make peace with the Provinces\r\nseparately while continuing the war with the House of Austria in Spain\r\nand Germany. Thus he returned to Richelieu's policy, and Holland was\r\nsaved. February 19, 1674, peace was signed between England and the\r\nProvinces. The latter recognized the absolute supremacy of the English\r\nflag from Cape Finisterre in Spain to Norway, and paid a war\r\nindemnity.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of England, which remained neutral during the remaining\r\nfour years of the war, necessarily made it less maritime. The King of\r\nFrance did not think his navy, either in numbers or efficiency, able\r\nto contend alone with that of Holland; he therefore withdrew it from\r\nthe ocean and confined his sea enterprises to the Mediterranean, with\r\none or two half-privateering expeditions to the West Indies. The\r\nUnited Provinces for their part, being freed from danger on the side\r\nof the sea, and not having, except for a short time, any serious idea\r\nof operating against the French coast, diminished their own fleets.\r\nThe war became more and more continental, and drew in more and more\r\nthe other powers of Europe. Gradually the German States cast their lot\r\nwith Austria, and on May 28, 1674, the Diet proclaimed war against\r\nFrance. The great work of French policy in the last generations was\r\nundone, Austria had resumed her supremacy in Germany, and Holland had\r\nnot been destroyed. On the Baltic, Denmark, seeing Sweden inclining\r\ntoward France, hastened to make common cause with the German Empire,\r\nsending fifteen thousand troops. There remained in Germany only\r\nBavaria, Hanover, and Wurtemberg faithful still to their French\r\nalliance. The land war had thus drawn in nearly all the powers of\r\nEurope, and, from the nature of the case, the principal theatre of the\r\nconflict was beyond the eastern boundary of France, toward the Rhine,\r\nand in the Spanish Netherlands; but while this was raging, a maritime\r\nepisode was introduced by the fact of Denmark and Sweden being engaged\r\non opposite sides. Of this it will not be necessary to speak, beyond\r\nmentioning that the Dutch sent a squadron under Tromp to join the\r\nDanes, and that the united fleets won a great victory over the Swedes\r\nin 1676, taking from them ten ships. It is therefore evident that the\r\nsea superiority of Holland detracted greatly from Sweden's value as an\r\nally to Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nAnother maritime strife arose in the Mediterranean by the revolt of\r\nthe Sicilians against the Spanish rule.[59] The help they asked from\r\nFrance was granted as a diversion against Spain, but the Sicilian\r\nenterprise never became more than a side issue. Its naval interest\r\nsprings from bringing Ruyter once more on the scene, and that as the\r\nantagonist of Duquesne, the equal, and by some thought even the\r\nsuperior, of Tourville, whose name has always stood far above all\r\nothers in the French navy of that day.\r\n\r\nMessina revolted in July, 1674, and the French king at once took it\r\nunder his protection. The Spanish navy throughout seems to have\r\nbehaved badly, certainly inefficiently; and early in 1675 the French\r\nwere safely established in the city. During the year their naval power\r\nin the Mediterranean was much increased, and Spain, unable to defend\r\nthe island herself, applied to the United Provinces for a fleet, the\r\nexpenses of which she would bear. The Provinces, \"fatigued by the war,\r\ninvolved in debt, suffering cruelly in their commerce, exhausted by\r\nthe necessity of paying the emperor and all the German princes, could\r\nno longer fit out the enormous fleets which they had once opposed to\r\nFrance and England.\" They however hearkened to Spain and sent De\r\nRuyter, with a squadron of only eighteen ships and four fire-ships.\r\nThe admiral, who had noted the growth of the French navy, said the\r\nforce was too small, and departed oppressed in spirit, but with the\r\ncalm resignation which was habitual to him. He reached Cadiz in\r\nSeptember, and in the mean time the French had further strengthened\r\nthemselves by the capture of Agosta, a port commanding the southeast\r\nof Sicily. De Ruyter was again delayed by the Spanish government, and\r\ndid not reach the north coast of the island until the end of December,\r\nwhen head winds kept him from entering the Straits of Messina. He\r\ncruised between Messina and the Lipari Islands in a position to\r\nintercept the French fleet convoying troops and supplies, which was\r\nexpected under Duquesne.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of January, 1676, the French came in sight, twenty\r\nships-of-the-line and six fire-ships; the Dutch had but nineteen\r\nships, one of which was a Spaniard, and four fire-ships; and it must\r\nbe remembered that, although there is no detailed account of the Dutch\r\nships in this action, they were as a rule inferior to those of\r\nEngland, and yet more to those of France. The first day was spent in\r\nmanoeuvring, the Dutch having the weather-gage; but during that night,\r\nwhich was squally and drove the Spanish galleys accompanying the Dutch\r\nto take refuge under Lipari, the wind shifted, and coming out at\r\nwest-southwest, gave the French the weather-gage and the power to\r\nattack. Duquesne resolved to use it, and sending the convoy ahead,\r\nformed his line on the starboard tack standing south; the Dutch did\r\nthe same, and waited for him (Plate V., A, A, A).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. V. STROMBOLI JAN. 8, 1676. Pl. Va. POCOCK AND\r\n   D'ACHÉ 1758.]\r\n\r\nAn emotion of surprise must be felt at seeing the great Dutch admiral\r\nsurrender the choice of attack on the 7th. At daybreak of that day he\r\nsaw the enemy and steered for him; at three P.M., a French account\r\nsays, he hauled his wind on the same tack as themselves, but out of\r\ncannon-shot to windward. How account for the seeming reluctance of the\r\nman who three years before had made the desperate attacks of Solebay\r\nand the Texel? His reasons have not been handed down; it may be that\r\nthe defensive advantages of the lee-gage had been recognized by this\r\nthoughtful seaman, especially when preparing to meet, with inferior\r\nforces, an enemy of impetuous gallantry and imperfect seamanship. If\r\nany such ideas did influence him they were justified by the result.\r\nThe battle of Stromboli presents a partial anticipation of the tactics\r\nof the French and English a hundred years later; but in this case it\r\nis the French who seek the weather-gage and attack with fury, while\r\nthe Dutch take the defensive. The results were very much such as Clerk\r\npointed out to the English in his celebrated work on naval tactics,\r\nthe accounts here followed being entirely French.[60]\r\n\r\nThe two fleets being drawn up in line-of-battle on the starboard tack,\r\nheading south, as has been said, De Ruyter awaited the attack which he\r\nhad refused to make. Being between the French and their port, he felt\r\nthey must fight. At nine A.M. the French line kept away all together\r\nand ran down obliquely upon the Dutch, a manoeuvre difficult to be\r\nperformed with accuracy, and during which the assailant receives his\r\nenemy's fire at disadvantage (A', A'', A'''). In doing this, two ships\r\nin the French van were seriously disabled. \"M. de la Fayette, in the\r\n'Prudente,' began the action; but having rashly thrown himself into\r\nthe midst of the enemy's van, he was dismantled and forced to haul\r\noff\" (a). Confusion ensued in the French line, from the difficult\r\ncharacter of the manoeuvre. \"Vice-Admiral de Preuilli, commanding the\r\nvan, in keeping away took too little room, so that in coming to the\r\nwind again, the ships, in too close order, lapped and interfered with\r\none another's fire [A']. The absence of M. de la Fayette from the line\r\nthrew the 'Parfait' into peril. Attacked by two ships, she lost her\r\nmaintopmast and had also to haul off for repairs.\" Again, the French\r\ncame into action in succession instead of all together, a usual and\r\nalmost inevitable result of the manoeuvre in question. \"In the _midst_\r\nof a terrible cannonade,\" that is, after part of his ships were\r\nengaged, \"Duquesne, commanding the centre, took post on the beam of\r\nRuyter's division.\" The French rear came into action still later,\r\nafter the centre (A'', A'''). \"Langeron and Bethune, commanding\r\nleading ships of the French centre, are crushed by superior forces.\"\r\nHow can this be, seeing the French had the more ships? It was because,\r\nas the narrative tells us, \"the French had not yet repaired the\r\ndisorder of the first movement.\" However, all at last got into action\r\n(B, B, B), and Duquesne gradually restored order. The Dutch, engaged\r\nall along the line, resisted everywhere, and there was not one of\r\ntheir ships which was not closely engaged; more cannot be said for the\r\nadmiral and captains of the inferior fleet. The remaining part of the\r\nfight is not very clearly related. Ruyter is said to have given way\r\ncontinually with his two leading divisions; but whether this was a\r\nconfession of weakness or a tactical move does not appear. The rear\r\nwas separated (C'), in permitting which either Ruyter or the immediate\r\ncommander was at fault; but the attempts made by the French to\r\nsurround and isolate it failed, probably because of damaged spars, for\r\none French ship did pass entirely around the separated division. The\r\naction ended at 4.30 P.M., except in the rear, and the Spanish galleys\r\nshortly after came up and towed the disabled Dutch ships away. Their\r\nescape shows how injured the French must have been. The positions, C,\r\nC', are intended to show the Dutch rear far separated, and the\r\ndisorder in which a fleet action under sail necessarily ended from\r\nloss of spars.\r\n\r\nThose who are familiar with Clerk's work on naval tactics, published\r\nabout 1780, will recognize in this account of the battle of Stromboli\r\nall the features to which he called the attention of English seamen in\r\nhis thesis on the methods of action employed by them and their\r\nadversaries in and before his time. Clerk's thesis started from the\r\npostulate that English seamen and officers were superior in skill or\r\nspirit, or both, to the French, and their ships on the whole as fast;\r\nthat they were conscious of this superiority and therefore eager to\r\nattack, while the French, equally conscious of inferiority, or for\r\nother reasons, were averse to decisive engagements. With these\r\ndispositions the latter, feeling they could rely on a blindly furious\r\nattack by the English, had evolved a crafty plan by which, while\r\nseeming to fight, they really avoided doing so, and at the same time\r\ndid the enemy much harm. This plan was to take the lee-gage, the\r\ncharacteristic of which, as has before been pointed out, is that it is\r\na defensive position, and to await attack. The English error,\r\naccording to Clerk, upon which the French had learned by experience\r\nthat they could always count, was in drawing up their line parallel to\r\nthe enemy, or nearly so, and then keeping away all together to attack,\r\nship for ship, each its opposite in the hostile line. By standing down\r\nin this manner the assailant lost the use of most of his artillery,\r\nwhile exposed to the full fire of his opponent, and invariably came up\r\nin confusion, because the order of attack was one difficult to\r\nmaintain at any time, and much more so in the smoke under fire, with\r\ntorn sails and falling masts. This was precisely the attack made by\r\nDuquesne at Stromboli, and it there had precisely the consequences\r\nClerk points out,--confusion in the line, the van arriving first and\r\ngetting the brunt of the fire of the defence, disabled ships in the\r\nvan causing confusion in the rear, etc. Clerk further asserts, and he\r\nseems to be right, that as the action grew warm, the French, by\r\nrunning off to leeward, in their turn, led the English to repeat the\r\nsame mode of attack;[61] and so we find, at Stromboli, Ruyter giving\r\nground in the same way, though his motive does not appear. Clerk also\r\npoints out that a necessary corollary of the lee-gage, assumed for\r\ntactical reasons, is to aim at the assailant's spars, his motive\r\npower, so that his attack cannot be pushed farther than the defendant\r\nchooses, and at Stromboli the crippled condition of the French is\r\nevident; for after Ruyter had fallen to leeward, and could no longer\r\nhelp his separated rear, it was practically unmolested by the French,\r\nalthough none of these had been sunk. While therefore there cannot\r\nwith certainty be attributed to Ruyter the deliberate choice of the\r\nlee-gage, for which there was as yet no precedent, it is evident that\r\nhe reaped all its benefits, and that the character of the French\r\nofficers of his day, inexperienced as seamen and of impetuous valor,\r\noffered just the conditions that gave most advantage to an inferior\r\nforce standing on the defensive. The qualities and characteristics of\r\nthe enemy are among the principal factors which a man of genius\r\nconsiders, and it was to this as much as to any other one trait that\r\nNelson owed his dazzling successes. On the other hand, the French\r\nadmiral attacked in a wholly unscientific manner, ship against ship,\r\nwithout an attempt to concentrate on a part of the enemy, or even\r\ntrying to keep him in play until the French squadron of eight\r\nships-of-the-line in Messina, near by, could join. Such tactics cannot\r\nbe named beside that of Solebay or the Texel; but as Duquesne was the\r\nbest French officer of the century, with the possible exception of\r\nTourville, this battle has a value of its own in the history of\r\ntactics, and may by no means be omitted. The standing of the\r\ncommander-in-chief is the warrant that it marks the highest point to\r\nwhich French naval tactics has as yet attained. Before quitting this\r\ndiscussion, it may be noted that the remedy Clerk proposed was to\r\nattack the rear ships of the enemy's line, and preferably to leeward;\r\nthe remainder of the fleet must then either abandon them or stand down\r\nfor a general action, which according to his postulate was all that\r\nthe English seamen desired.\r\n\r\nAfter the fight De Ruyter sailed to Palermo, one of his ships sinking\r\non the way. Duquesne was joined outside Messina by the French division\r\nthat had been lying there. The remaining incidents of the Sicilian war\r\nare unimportant to the general subject. On the 22d of April, De Ruyter\r\nand Duquesne met again off Agosta. Duquesne had twenty-nine ships, the\r\nallied Spaniards and Dutch twenty-seven, of which ten were Spanish.\r\nUnfortunately the Spaniard commanded in chief, and took the centre of\r\nthe line with the ships of his country, contrary to the advice of\r\nRuyter, who, knowing how inefficient his allies were, wished to\r\nscatter them through the line and so support them better. Ruyter\r\nhimself took the van, and the allies, having the wind, attacked; but\r\nthe Spanish centre kept at long cannon range, leaving the brunt of the\r\nbattle to fall on the Dutch van. The rear, following the\r\ncommander-in-chief's motions, was also but slightly engaged. In this\r\nsorrowful yet still glorious fulfilment of hopeless duty, De Ruyter,\r\nwho never before in his long career had been struck by an enemy's\r\nshot, received a mortal wound. He died a week later at Syracuse, and\r\nwith him passed away the last hope of resistance on the sea. A month\r\nlater the Spanish and Dutch fleets were attacked at anchor at Palermo,\r\nand many of them destroyed; while a division sent from Holland to\r\nreinforce the Mediterranean fleet was met by a French squadron in the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar and forced to take refuge in Cadiz.\r\n\r\nThe Sicilian enterprise continued to be only a diversion, and the\r\nslight importance attached to it shows clearly how entirely Louis XIV.\r\nwas bent on the continental war. How differently would the value of\r\nSicily have impressed him, had his eyes been fixed on Egypt and\r\nextension by sea. As the years passed, the temper of the English\r\npeople became more and more excited against France; the trade\r\nrivalries with Holland seemed to fall into the shade, and it became\r\nlikely that England, which had entered the war as the ally of Louis,\r\nwould, before it closed, take up arms against him. In addition to\r\nother causes of jealousy she saw the French navy increased to a number\r\nsuperior to her own. Charles for a while resisted the pressure of\r\nParliament, but in January, 1678, a treaty of alliance, offensive and\r\ndefensive, was made between the two sea countries; the king recalled\r\nthe English troops which until now had been serving as part of the\r\nFrench army, and when Parliament opened again in February, asked for\r\nmoney to equip ninety ships and thirty thousand soldiers. Louis, who\r\nwas expecting this result, at once ordered the evacuation of Sicily.\r\nHe did not fear England by land, but on the sea he could not yet hold\r\nhis own against the union of the two sea powers. At the same time he\r\nredoubled his attacks on the Spanish Netherlands. As long as there was\r\na hope of keeping the ships of England out of the fight, he had\r\navoided touching the susceptibilities of the English people on the\r\nsubject of the Belgian sea-coast; but now that they could no longer be\r\nconciliated, he thought best to terrify Holland by the sharpness of\r\nhis attack in the quarter where she dreaded him most.\r\n\r\nThe United Provinces were in truth the mainspring of the coalition.\r\nThough among the smallest in extent of the countries arrayed against\r\nLouis, they were strongest in the character and purpose of their\r\nruler, the Prince of Orange, and in the wealth which, while supporting\r\nthe armies of the confederates, also kept the poor and greedy German\r\nprinces faithful to their alliance. Almost alone, by dint of mighty\r\nsea power, by commercial and maritime ability, they bore the burden of\r\nthe war; and though they staggered and complained, they still bore it.\r\nAs in later centuries England, so at the time we are now speaking of\r\nHolland, the great sea power, supported the war against the ambition\r\nof France; but her sufferings were great. Her commerce, preyed upon by\r\nFrench privateers, lost heavily; and there was added an immense\r\nindirect loss in the transfer of the carrying-trade between foreign\r\ncountries, which had contributed so much to the prosperity of the\r\nDutch. When the flag of England became neutral, this rich business\r\nwent to her ships, which crossed the seas the more securely because of\r\nthe eager desire of Louis to conciliate the English nation. This\r\ndesire led him also to make very large concessions to English\r\nexigencies in the matter of commercial treaties, undoing much of the\r\nwork of protection upon which Colbert sought to nourish the yet feeble\r\ngrowth of French sea power. These sops, however, only stayed for a\r\nmoment the passions which were driving England; it was not\r\nself-interest, but stronger motives, which impelled her to a break\r\nwith France.\r\n\r\nStill less was it to the interest of Holland to prolong the war, after\r\nLouis showed a wish for peace. A continental war could at best be but\r\na necessary evil, and source of weakness to her. The money she spent\r\non her own and the allied armies was lost to her navy, and the sources\r\nof her prosperity on the sea were being exhausted. How far the Prince\r\nof Orange was justified, by the aims of Louis XIV., in that unyielding\r\nattitude of opposition toward him which he always maintained, may be\r\nuncertain, and there is here no need to decide the question; but there\r\ncan be no doubt that the strife sacrificed the sea power of Holland\r\nthrough sheer exhaustion, and with it destroyed her position among\r\nthe nations of the world. \"Situated between France and England,\" says\r\na historian of Holland, \"by one or other of them were the United\r\nProvinces, after they had achieved their independence of Spain,\r\nconstantly engaged in wars, which exhausted their finances,\r\nannihilated their navy, and caused the rapid decline of their trade,\r\nmanufactures, and commerce; and thus a peace-loving nation found\r\nherself crushed by the weight of unprovoked and long-continued\r\nhostilities. Often, too, the friendship of England was scarcely less\r\nharmful to Holland than her enmity. As one increased and the other\r\nlessened, it became the alliance of the giant and the dwarf.\"[62]\r\nHitherto we have seen Holland the open enemy or hearty rival of\r\nEngland; henceforward she appears as an ally,--in both cases a\r\nsufferer from her smaller size, weaker numbers, and less favored\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustion of the United Provinces and the clamor of their\r\nmerchants and peace party on the one hand, aided on the other by the\r\nsufferings of France, the embarrassment of her finances, and the\r\nthreatened addition of England's navy to her already numerous enemies,\r\ninclined to peace the two principal parties to this long war. Louis\r\nhad long been willing to make peace with Holland alone; but the States\r\nhad been withheld, at first by fidelity to those who had joined them\r\nin their hour of trouble, and latterly by the firm purpose of William\r\nof Orange. Difficulties were gradually smoothed away, and the Peace of\r\nNimeguen between the United Provinces and France was signed August 11,\r\n1678. The other powers shortly afterward acceded to it. The principal\r\nsufferer, as was natural, was the overgrown but feeble monarchy whose\r\ncentre was Spain, which gave up to France Franche Comté and a number\r\nof fortified towns in the Spanish Netherlands, thus extending the\r\nboundaries of France to the east and northeast. Holland, for whose\r\ndestruction Louis began the war, lost not a foot of ground in Europe;\r\nand beyond the seas only her colonies on the west coast of Africa and\r\nin Guiana. She owed her safety at first, and the final successful\r\nissue, to her sea power. That delivered her in the hour of extreme\r\ndanger, and enabled her afterward to keep alive the general war. It\r\nmay be said to have been one of the chief factors, and inferior to no\r\nother one singly, in determining the event of the great war which was\r\nformally closed at Nimeguen.\r\n\r\nThe effort none the less sapped her strength, and being followed by\r\nmany years of similar strain broke her down. But what was the effect\r\nupon the vastly greater state, the extreme ambition of whose king was\r\nthe principal cause of the exhausting wars of this time? Among the\r\nmany activities which illustrated the brilliant opening of the reign\r\nof the then youthful king of France, none was so important, none so\r\nintelligently directed, as those of Colbert, who aimed first at\r\nrestoring the finances from the confusion into which they had fallen,\r\nand then at establishing them upon a firm foundation of national\r\nwealth. This wealth, at that time utterly beneath the possibilities of\r\nFrance, was to be developed on the lines of production encouraged,\r\ntrade stimulated to healthful activity, a large merchant shipping, a\r\ngreat navy, and colonial extension. Some of these are sources, others\r\nthe actual constituents, of sea power; which indeed may be said in a\r\nseaboard nation to be the invariable accompaniment, if it be not the\r\nchief source, of its strength. For nearly twelve years all went well;\r\nthe development of the greatness of France in all these directions\r\nwent forward rapidly, if not in all with equal strides, and the king's\r\nrevenues increased by bounds. Then came the hour in which he had to\r\ndecide whether the exertions which his ambition naturally, perhaps\r\nproperly, prompted should take the direction which, while imposing\r\ngreat efforts, did nothing to sustain but rather hindered the natural\r\nactivities of his people, and broke down commerce by making control of\r\nthe sea uncertain; or whether he should launch out in pursuits which,\r\nwhile involving expense, would keep peace on his borders, lead to the\r\ncontrol of the sea, and by the impulse given to trade, and all upon\r\nwhich trade depends, would bring in money nearly if not quite equal\r\nto that which the State spent. This is not a fanciful picture; by his\r\nattitude toward Holland, and its consequences, Louis gave the first\r\nimpulse to England upon the path which realized to her, within his own\r\nday, the results which Colbert and Leibnitz had hoped for France. He\r\ndrove the Dutch carrying-trade into the ships of England; allowed her\r\nto settle peacefully Pennsylvania and Carolina, and to seize New York\r\nand New Jersey; and he sacrificed, to gain her neutrality, the growing\r\ncommerce of France. Not all at once, but very rapidly, England pressed\r\ninto the front place as a sea power; and however great her sufferings\r\nand the sufferings of individual Englishmen, it remained true of her\r\nthat even in war her prosperity was great. Doubtless France could not\r\nforget her continental position, nor wholly keep free from continental\r\nwars; but it may be believed that if she had chosen the path of sea\r\npower, she might both have escaped many conflicts and borne those that\r\nwere unavoidable with greater ease. At the Peace of Nimeguen the\r\ninjuries were not irreparable, but \"the agricultural classes,\r\ncommerce, manufactures, and the colonies had alike been smitten by the\r\nwar; and the conditions of peace, so advantageous to the territorial\r\nand military power of France, were much less so to manufactures, the\r\nprotective tariffs having been lowered in favor of England and\r\nHolland,\"[63] the two sea powers. The merchant shipping was stricken,\r\nand the splendid growth of the royal navy, that excited the jealousy\r\nof England, was like a tree without roots; it soon withered away under\r\nthe blast of war.\r\n\r\nBefore finally quitting this war with Holland, a short notice of the\r\nComte d'Estrées, to whom Louis committed the charge of the French\r\ncontingent of the allied fleet, and who commanded it at Solebay and\r\nthe Texel, will throw some light upon the qualifications of the French\r\nnaval officers of the day before experience had made seamen of many of\r\nthem. D'Estrées went to sea for the first time in 1667, being then a\r\nman of mature years; but in 1672 we find him in the chief command of\r\nan important squadron, having under him Duquesne, who was a seaman,\r\nand had been so for nearly forty years. In 1677, D'Estrées obtained\r\nfrom the king a body of eight ships which he undertook to maintain at\r\nhis own expense, upon the condition of receiving half the prizes made.\r\nWith this squadron he made an attack upon the then Dutch island of\r\nTobago, with a recklessness which showed that no lack of courage\r\nprompted his equivocal conduct at the Texel. The next year he went out\r\nagain and contrived to run the whole squadron ashore on the Aves\r\nIslands. The account given by the flag-captain of this transaction is\r\namusing as well as instructive. In his report he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"The day that the squadron was lost, the sun having been taken\r\n    by the pilots, the vice-admiral as usual had them put down the\r\n    position in his cabin. As I was entering to learn what was going\r\n    on, I met the third pilot, Bourdaloue, who was going out crying.\r\n    I asked him what the matter was, and he answered: 'Because I\r\n    find more drift than the other pilots, the admiral is\r\n    threatening me and abusing me, as usual; yet I am only a poor\r\n    lad who does the best he can.' When I had entered the cabin, the\r\n    admiral, who was very angry, said to me, 'That scoundrel of a\r\n    Bourdaloue is always coming to me with some nonsense or other; I\r\n    will drive him out of the ship. He makes us to be running a\r\n    course, the devil knows where, I don't.' As I did not know which\r\n    was right,\" says the captain of the ship, rather naïvely, \"I did\r\n    not dare to say anything for fear of bringing down a like storm\r\n    on my own head.\"[64]\r\n\r\nSome hours after this scene, which, as the French officer from whom\r\nthe extract is taken says, \"appears now almost grotesque, but which is\r\nonly an exact portrayal of the sea manners of the day, the whole\r\nsquadron was lost on a group of rocks known as the Aves Islands. Such\r\nwere the officers.\" The flag-captain, in another part of his report,\r\nsays: \"The shipwreck resulted from the general line of conduct held by\r\nVice-Admiral d'Estrées. It was always the opinion of his servants, or\r\nothers than the proper officers of the ship, which prevailed. This\r\nmanner of acting may be understood in the Comte d'Estrées, who,\r\nwithout the necessary knowledge of a profession he had embraced so\r\nlate, always had with him obscure counsellors, in order to appropriate\r\nthe opinions they gave him so as to blind the ship's company as to his\r\ncapacity.\"[65] D'Estrées had been made vice-admiral two years after he\r\nfirst went aboard ship.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] Martin: History of France.\r\n\r\n[46] Martin: History of France.\r\n\r\n[47] Ledyard, vol ii. p. 599; Campbell: Lives of the Admirals.

In time a\r\nsecond line was partly formed, which in its turn protected the ships\r\nwhich had remained on the first, as they executed the somewhat exposed\r\nmovement of falling back. In Plan V., Dutch ships at b, b, b, are\r\nrepresented as thus withdrawing. English official reports of the\r\neighteenth century often speak of French ships acting thus; the\r\nEnglish officers attributing to their superior valor a movement which\r\nClerk more plausibly considers a skilful military manoeuvre, well\r\ncalculated to give the defence several opportunities of disabling the\r\nassailants as they bore down on a course which impeded the use of\r\ntheir artillery. In 1812 the frigate \"United States,\" commanded by\r\nDecatur, employed the same tactics in her fight with the \"Macedonian;\"\r\nand the Confederate gunboats at Mobile by the same means inflicted on\r\nFarragut's flag-ship the greater part of the heavy loss which she\r\nsustained. In its essential features the same line of action can now\r\nbe followed by a defendant, having greater speed, when the ardor of\r\nthe attack, or the necessities of the case, force the assailant to a\r\ndirect approach. An indirect cause of a lee line falling farther to\r\nleeward has never been noticed. When a ship in that line (as at c)\r\nfound itself without an opponent abeam, and its next ahead perhaps\r\nheavily engaged, the natural impulse would be to put up the helm so as\r\nto bring the broadside to bear. This advantage would be gained by a\r\nloss of ground to leeward and consequent disorder in the line; which,\r\nif the act were repeated by several ships, could only be restored by\r\nthe whole line keeping away.\r\n\r\n[62] Davies: History of Holland.\r\n\r\n[63] Martin: History of France.\r\n\r\n[64] Gougeard: Marine de Guerre.\r\n\r\n[65] Troude: Batailles Navales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    ENGLISH REVOLUTION.--WAR OF THE LEAGUE OF AUGSBURG,\r\n    1688-1697.--SEA BATTLES OF BEACHY HEAD AND LA HOUGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Nimeguen was followed by a period of ten years in which\r\nno extensive war broke out. They were, however, far from being years\r\nof political quiet. Louis XIV. was as intent upon pushing on his\r\nfrontiers to the eastward in peace as in war, and grasped in quick\r\nsuccession fragments of territory which had not been given him by the\r\npeace. Claiming this and that in virtue of ancient feudal ties; this\r\nand that other as implicitly surrendered by the treaty, because\r\ndependent upon something else that had been explicitly surrendered;\r\npurchasing at one time, using bare force in other cases, and backing\r\nup all the so-called peaceful methods of obtaining his asserted rights\r\nby the presence of armed power, he carried on this process of\r\nextension between 1679 and 1682. The aggression most startling to\r\nEurope, and above all to the German Empire, was the seizure of the\r\nthen imperial city of Strasburg on the 30th of September, 1681; and on\r\nthe same day Casale, in Italy, was sold to him by the Duke of Mantua,\r\nshowing that his ambitions were directed that way as well as to the\r\nnorth and east. Both of these were positions of great strategic\r\nimportance, threatening, the one Germany, the other Italy, in case of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe excitement throughout Europe was very great; in every direction\r\nLouis, serenely trusting to his power, was making new enemies and\r\nalienating former friends. The king of Sweden, directly insulted, and\r\ninjured in his duchy of Deux-Ponts, turned against him, as did the\r\nItalian States; and the Pope himself sided with the enemies of a king\r\nwho was already showing his zeal for the conversion of the\r\nProtestants, and was preparing for the revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes. But the discontent, though deep and general, had to be\r\norganized and directed; the spirit necessary to give it form and final\r\neffective expression was found again in Holland, in William of Orange.\r\nTime, however, was needed to mature the work. \"No one yet armed\r\nhimself; but every one talked, wrote, agitated, from Stockholm to\r\nMadrid.... The war of the pen preceded by many years the war of the\r\nsword; incessant appeals were made to European opinion by\r\nindefatigable publicists; under all forms was diffused the terror of\r\nthe New Universal Monarchy,\" which was seeking to take the place once\r\nfilled by the House of Austria. It was known that Louis sought to make\r\nhimself or his son emperor of Germany. But complications of different\r\nkinds, private interests, lack of money, all combined to delay action.\r\nThe United Provinces, despite William's wishes, were yet unwilling to\r\nact again as banker for a coalition, and the emperor was so threatened\r\non his eastern frontier by the rebel Hungarians and the Turks that he\r\ndared not risk a western war.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the armed navy of France was daily growing in strength and\r\nefficiency under Colbert's care, and acquiring the habit of war by\r\nattacks upon the Barbary pirates and their ports. During the same\r\nyears the navies both of England and of Holland were declining in\r\nnumbers and efficiency. It has already been said that in 1688, when\r\nWilliam needed Dutch ships for his expedition to England, it was\r\nobjected that the navy was in a far different condition from 1672,\r\n\"being incalculably decreased in strength and deprived of its most\r\nable commanders.\" In England, the decline of discipline had been\r\nfollowed by an economical policy as to material, gradually lessening\r\nthe numbers and injuring the condition of the fleet; and after the\r\nlittle flare-up and expected war with France in 1678, the king gave\r\nthe care of the navy to a new body of men, concerning whom an English\r\nnaval historian says: \"This new administration lasted five years, and\r\nif it had continued five years longer would in all probability have\r\nremedied even the numerous and mighty evils it had introduced, by\r\nwearing out the whole royal navy, and so leaving no room for future\r\nmistakes. However, a just sense of this induced the king, in 1684, to\r\nresume the management of the fleet into his own hands, restoring most\r\nof the old officers; but before any great progress in the work of\r\nrestoration could be made, his Majesty died,\"[66]--in 1685. The change\r\nof sovereigns was of vast importance, not merely to the English navy,\r\nbut from the ultimate effect it was to have upon the designs of Louis\r\nXIV. and the fortune of the general war which his aggressions were\r\npreparing. James II. was peculiarly interested in the navy, being\r\nhimself a seaman, and having commanded in chief at Lowestoft and\r\nSouthwold Bay. He knew its actual depressed condition; and the\r\nmeasures he at once took to restore it, both in numbers and\r\nefficiency, were thoughtful and thorough. In the three years of his\r\nreign very much indeed was done to prepare a weapon which was first\r\nproved against himself and his best friend.\r\n\r\nThe accession of James II., which promised fairly for Louis,\r\nprecipitated the action of Europe against him. The House of Stuart,\r\nclosely allied to the King of France, and sympathizing with his\r\nabsolutist rule, had used the still great power of the sovereign to\r\ncheck the political and religious enmity of the English nation to\r\nFrance. James II. added to the same political sympathies a strength of\r\nRoman Catholic fervor which led him into acts peculiarly fitted to\r\nrevolt the feeling of the English people, with the final result of\r\ndriving him from the throne, and calling to it, by the voice of\r\nParliament, his daughter Mary, whose husband was William of Orange.\r\n\r\nIn the same year that James became king, a vast diplomatic combination\r\nagainst France began. This movement had two sides, religious and\r\npolitical. The Protestant States were enraged at the increasing\r\npersecutions of the French Protestants, and their feelings became\r\nstronger as the policy of James of England showed itself more and more\r\nbent toward Rome. The Protestant northern States, Holland, Sweden, and\r\nBrandenburg, drew together in alliances; and they counted for support\r\nupon the Emperor of Austria and Germany, upon Spain and other Roman\r\nCatholic States whose motives were political apprehension and anger.\r\nThe emperor had latterly been successful against the Turks, thus\r\nfreeing his hands for a move against France. July 9, 1686, there was\r\nsigned at Augsburg a secret agreement between the emperor, the kings\r\nof Spain and Sweden, and a number of German princes. Its object was at\r\nfirst defensive only against France, but it could readily be turned\r\ninto an offensive alliance. This compact took the name of the League\r\nof Augsburg, and from it the general war which followed two years\r\nlater was called the War of the League of Augsburg.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1687, saw yet greater successes of the Empire over the\r\nTurks and Hungarians. It was evident that France could expect no more\r\nfrom diversions in that quarter. At the same time the discontent of\r\nthe English and the ambitions of the Prince of Orange, who hoped from\r\nhis accession to the throne of England no ordinary personal\r\naggrandizement, but the fulfilment of his strongest political wish and\r\nconviction, in curbing forever the power of Louis XIV., became more\r\nand more plain. But for his expedition into England, William needed\r\nships, money, and men from the United Provinces; and they hung back,\r\nknowing that the result would be war with the French king, who\r\nproclaimed James his ally. Their action was at last decided by the\r\ncourse of Louis, who chose this moment to revoke concessions made at\r\nNimeguen to Dutch trade. The serious injury thus done to Holland's\r\nmaterial interests turned the wavering scale. \"This violation of the\r\nconventions of Nimeguen,\" says a French historian,[67] \"by giving a\r\nsevere blow to Dutch commerce, reducing her European trade more than\r\none fourth, removed the obstacle that religious passions still\r\nencountered in material interests, and put all Holland at the\r\ndisposition of William, none having reason longer to conciliate\r\nFrance.\" This was in November, 1687. In the summer of the following\r\nyear the birth of an heir to the English throne brought things to an\r\nissue. English loyalty might have put up with the reign of the father,\r\nnow advanced in years, but could not endure the prospect of a\r\ncontinued Roman Catholic royalty.\r\n\r\nMatters had at last reached the crisis to which they had been tending\r\nfor years. Louis and William of Orange, long-standing enemies, and at\r\nthe moment the two chief figures in European politics, alike from\r\ntheir own strong personalities and the cause which either represented,\r\nstood on the brink of great actions, whose effects were to be felt\r\nthrough many generations. William, despotic in temper himself, stood\r\non the shores of Holland looking hopefully toward free England, from\r\nwhich he was separated by the narrow belt of water that was the\r\ndefence of the island kingdom, and might yet be an impassable barrier\r\nto his own high aims; for the French king at that moment could control\r\nthe sea if he would. Louis, holding all the power of France in his\r\nsingle grasp, facing eastward as before, saw the continent gathering\r\nagainst him; while on his flank was England heartily hostile, longing\r\nto enter on the strife against him, but as yet without a leader. It\r\nstill remained with him to decide whether he would leave the road open\r\nfor the head to join the waiting body, and to bring Holland and\r\nEngland, the two sea powers, under one rule. If he attacked Holland by\r\nland, and sent his superior navy into the Channel, he might well keep\r\nWilliam in his own country; the more so as the English navy, beloved\r\nand petted by the king, was likely to have more than the usual loyalty\r\nof seamen to their chief. Faithful to the bias of his life, perhaps\r\nunable to free himself from it, he turned toward the continent, and\r\nSeptember 24, 1688, declared war against Germany and moved his armies\r\ntoward the Rhine. William, overjoyed, saw removed the last obstacle to\r\nhis ambition. Delayed for some weeks by contrary winds, he finally\r\nset sail from Holland on the 30th of October. More than five hundred\r\ntransports, with fifteen thousand troops, escorted by fifty\r\nmen-of-war, formed the expedition; and it is typical of its mingled\r\npolitical and religious character, that the larger part of the army\r\nofficers were French Protestants who had been driven from France since\r\nthe last war, the commander-in-chief under William being the Huguenot\r\nSchomberg, late a marshal of France. The first start was foiled by a\r\nviolent storm; but sailing again on the 10th of November, a fresh,\r\nfair breeze carried the ships through the Straits and the Channel, and\r\nWilliam landed on the 15th at Torbay. Before the end of the year,\r\nJames had fled from his kingdom. On the 21st of the following April,\r\nWilliam and Mary were proclaimed sovereigns of Great Britain, and\r\nEngland and Holland were united for the war, which Louis had declared\r\nagainst the United Provinces as soon as he heard of William's\r\ninvasion. During all the weeks that the expedition was preparing and\r\ndelayed, the French ambassador at the Hague and the minister of the\r\nnavy were praying the king to stop it with his great sea power,--a\r\npower so great that the French fleet in the first years of the war\r\noutnumbered those of England and Holland combined; but Louis would\r\nnot. Blindness seems to have struck the kings of England and France\r\nalike; for James, amid all his apprehensions, steadily refused any\r\nassistance from the French fleet, trusting to the fidelity of the\r\nEnglish seamen to his person, although his attempts to have Mass\r\ncelebrated on board the ships had occasioned an uproar and mutiny\r\nwhich nearly ended in the crews throwing the priests overboard.\r\n\r\nFrance thus entered the War of the League of Augsburg without a single\r\nally. \"What her policy had most feared, what she had long averted, was\r\ncome to pass. England and Holland were not only allied, but united\r\nunder the same chief; and England entered the coalition with all the\r\neagerness of passions long restrained by the Stuart policy.\" As\r\nregards the sea war, the different battles have much less tactical\r\nvalue than those of De Ruyter. The chief points of strategic interest\r\nare the failure of Louis, having a decided superiority at sea,\r\nproperly to support James II. in Ireland, which remained faithful to\r\nhim, and the gradual disappearance from the ocean of the great French\r\nfleets, which Louis XIV. could no longer maintain, owing to the\r\nexpense of that continental policy which he had chosen for himself. A\r\nthird point of rather minor interest is the peculiar character and\r\nlarge proportions taken on by the commerce-destroying and privateering\r\nwarfare of the French, as their large fleets were disappearing. This,\r\nand the great effect produced by it, will appear at first to\r\ncontradict what has been said as to the general inadequacy of such a\r\nwarfare when not supported by fleets; but an examination of the\r\nconditions, which will be made later on, will show that the\r\ncontradiction is rather apparent than real.\r\n\r\nTaught by the experience of the last conflict, the chief effort of the\r\nFrench king, in the general war he had brought upon himself, should\r\nhave been directed against the sea powers,--against William of Orange\r\nand the Anglo-Dutch alliance. The weakest point in William's position\r\nwas Ireland; though in England itself not only were there many\r\npartisans of the exiled king, but even those who had called in William\r\nfenced his kingship about with jealous restrictions. His power was not\r\nsecure so long as Ireland was not subdued. James, having fled from\r\nEngland in January, 1689, landed in Ireland in the following March,\r\naccompanied by French troops and a French squadron, and was\r\nenthusiastically welcomed everywhere but in the Protestant North. He\r\nmade Dublin his capital, and remained in the country until July of the\r\nnext year. During these fifteen months the French were much superior\r\nat sea; they landed troops in Ireland on more than one occasion; and\r\nthe English, attempting to prevent this, were defeated in the naval\r\nbattle of Bantry Bay.[68] But although James was so well established,\r\nand it was of the utmost importance to sustain him; although it was\r\nequally important to keep William from getting a foothold till James\r\nwas further strengthened and Londonderry, then passing through its\r\nfamous siege, reduced; and although the French were superior to the\r\nunited English and Dutch on the seas in 1689 and 1690; nevertheless,\r\nthe English admiral Rooke was able, unmolested, to throw succors and\r\ntroops into Londonderry, and afterward landed Marshal Schomberg, with\r\na small army, near Carrickfergus. Rooke stopped intercourse between\r\nIreland and Scotland, where were many Stuart partisans, and then with\r\nhis small squadron passed along the east coast of Ireland, attempted\r\nto burn the shipping in Dublin harbor, failing only through lack of\r\nwind, and finally came off Cork, then occupied by James, took\r\npossession of an island in the harbor, and returned in safety to the\r\nDowns in October. These services, which raised the siege of\r\nLondonderry and kept open the communications between England and\r\nIreland, extended throughout the summer months; nor was any attempt\r\nmade by the French to stop them. There can be little doubt that an\r\neffective co-operation of the French fleet in the summer of 1689 would\r\nhave broken down all opposition to James in Ireland, by isolating that\r\ncountry from England, with corresponding injury to William's power.\r\n\r\nThe following year the same strategic and political mistake was made.\r\nIt is the nature of an enterprise such as James's, dependent upon a\r\nweaker people and foreign help, to lose strength if it does not\r\nprogress; but the chances were still in his favor, provided France\r\nco-operated heartily, and above all, with her fleet. It is equally the\r\nnature of a merely military navy like that of France to be strongest\r\nat the beginning of hostilities; whereas that of the allied sea powers\r\ngrew daily stronger, drawing upon the vast resources of their merchant\r\nshipping and their wealth. The disparity of force was still in favor\r\nof France in 1690, but it was not as great as the year before. The\r\nall-important question was where to direct it. There were two\r\nprincipal courses, involving two views of naval strategy. The one was\r\nto act against the allied fleet, whose defeat, if sufficiently severe,\r\nmight involve the fall of William's throne in England; the other was\r\nto make the fleet subsidiary to the Irish campaign. The French king\r\ndecided upon the former, which was undoubtedly the proper course; but\r\nthere was no reason for neglecting, as he did, the important duty of\r\ncutting off the communications between the two islands. As early as\r\nMarch he had sent a large fleet with six thousand troops and supplies\r\nof war, which were landed without any trouble in the southern ports of\r\nIreland; but after performing that service, the ships employed\r\nreturned to Brest, and there remained inactive during May and June\r\nwhile the grand fleet under the Comte de Tourville was assembling.\r\nDuring those two months the English were gathering an army on their\r\nwest coast, and on the 21st of June, William embarked his forces at\r\nChester on board two hundred and eighty-eight transports, escorted by\r\nonly six men-of-war. On the 24th he landed in Carrickfergus, and the\r\nships-of-war were dismissed to join the English grand fleet, which,\r\nhowever, they were not able to do; Tourville's ships having in the\r\nmean time got to sea and occupied the channel to the eastward. There\r\nis nothing more striking than the carelessness shown by both the\r\ncontending parties, during the time that Ireland was in dispute, as to\r\nthe communications of their opponents with the island; but this was\r\nespecially strange in the French, as they had the larger forces, and\r\nmust have received pretty accurate information of what was going on\r\nfrom disaffected persons in England. It appears that a squadron of\r\ntwenty-five frigates, to be supported by ships-of-the-line, were told\r\noff for duty in St. George's Channel; but they never reached their\r\nstation, and only ten of the frigates had got as far as Kinsale by the\r\ntime James had lost all at the battle of the Boyne. The English\r\ncommunications were not even threatened for an hour.\r\n\r\nTourville's fleet, complete in numbers, having seventy-eight ships, of\r\nwhich seventy were in the line-of-battle, with twenty-two fire-ships,\r\ngot to sea June 22, the day after William embarked. On the 30th the\r\nFrench were off the Lizard, to the dismay of the English admiral, who\r\nwas lying off the Isle of Wight in such an unprepared attitude that\r\nhe had not even lookout ships to the westward. He got under way,\r\nstanding off-shore to the southeast, and was joined from time to time,\r\nduring the next ten days, by other English and Dutch ships. The two\r\nfleets continued moving to the eastward, sighting each other from time\r\nto time.\r\n\r\nThe political situation in England was critical. The Jacobites were\r\ngrowing more and more open in their demonstrations, Ireland had been\r\nin successful revolt for over a year, and William was now there,\r\nleaving only the queen in London. The urgency of the case was such\r\nthat the council decided the French fleet must be fought, and orders\r\nto that effect were sent to the English admiral, Herbert. In obedience\r\nto his instructions he went out, and on the 10th of July, being to\r\nwindward, with the wind at northeast, formed his line-of-battle, and\r\nthen stood down to attack the French, who waited for him, with their\r\nforetopsails aback[69] on the starboard tack, heading to the northward\r\nand westward.\r\n\r\nThe fight that followed is known as the battle of Beachy Head. The\r\nships engaged were, French seventy, English and Dutch according to\r\ntheir own account fifty-six, according to the French sixty. In the\r\nallied line of battle the Dutch were in the van; the English,\r\ncommanded in person by Herbert, in the centre; and the rear was made\r\nup partly of English and partly of Dutch ships. The stages of the\r\nbattle were as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The allies, being to windward, bore down together in line abreast.\r\nAs usual, this manoeuvre was ill performed, and as also generally\r\nhappens, the van came under fire before the centre and rear, and bore\r\nthe brunt of the injury.\r\n\r\n2. Admiral Herbert, though commander-in-chief, failed to attack\r\nvigorously with the centre, keeping it at long range. The allied van\r\nand rear came to close action (Plate VI., A). Paul Hoste's[70] account\r\nof this manoeuvre of the allies is that the admiral intended to fall\r\nmainly on the French rear. To that end he closed the centre to the\r\nrear and kept it to windward at long cannon-shot (refused it), so as\r\nto prevent the French from tacking and doubling on the rear. If that\r\nwere his purpose, his plan, though tolerably conceived in the main,\r\nwas faulty in detail, for this manoeuvre of the centre left a great\r\ngap between it and the van. He should rather have attacked, as Ruyter\r\ndid at the Texel, as many of the rear ships as he thought he could\r\ndeal with, and refused his van, assigning to it the part of checking\r\nthe French van. It may be conceded that an admiral who, from inferior\r\nnumbers, cannot spread as long and close a line as his enemy, should\r\nnot let the latter overlap the extremities of his fleet; but he should\r\nattain his end not, as Herbert did, by leaving a great opening in the\r\ncentre, but by increasing each interval between the ships refused. The\r\nallied fleet was thus exposed to be doubled on at two points, both van\r\nand centre; and both points were attacked.\r\n\r\n3. The commander of the French van, seeing the Dutch close to his line\r\nand more disabled than himself, pressed six of his leading ships\r\nahead, where they went about, and so put the Dutch between two fires\r\n(Plate VI. B).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. VI. LA HOUGUE MAY 29, 1692. Pl. VIa. BEACHY\r\n   HEAD JULY 10, 1690.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time Tourville, finding himself without adversaries in the\r\ncentre, having beaten off the leading division of the enemy's centre,\r\npushed forward his own leading ships, which Herbert's dispositions had\r\nleft without opponents; and these fresh ships strengthened the attack\r\nupon the Dutch in the van (B).\r\n\r\nThis brought about a _mêlée_ at the head of the lines, in which the\r\nDutch, being inferior, suffered heavily. Luckily for the allies the\r\nwind fell calm; and while Tourville himself and other French ships got\r\nout their boats to tow into action again, the allies were shrewd\r\nenough to drop anchor with all sail set, and before Tourville took in\r\nthe situation the ebb-tide, setting southwest, had carried his fleet\r\nout of action. He finally anchored a league from his enemy.\r\n\r\nAt nine P.M., when the tide changed, the allies weighed and stood to\r\nthe eastward. So badly had many of them been mauled, that, by English\r\naccounts, it was decided rather to destroy the disabled ships than to\r\nrisk a general engagement to preserve them.\r\n\r\nTourville pursued; but instead of ordering a general chase, he kept\r\nthe line-of-battle, reducing the speed of the fleet to that of the\r\nslower ships. The occasion was precisely one of those in which a\r\n_mêlée_ is permissible, indeed, obligatory. An enemy beaten and in\r\nflight should be pursued with ardor, and with only so much regard to\r\norder as will prevent the chasing vessels from losing mutual\r\nsupport,--a condition which by no means implies such relative bearings\r\nand distances as are required in the beginning or middle of a\r\nwell-contested action. The failure to order such general pursuit\r\nindicates the side on which Tourville's military character lacked\r\ncompleteness; and the failure showed itself, as is apt to be the case,\r\nat the supreme moment of his career. He never had such another\r\nopportunity as in this, the first great general action in which he\r\ncommanded in chief, and which Hoste, who was on board the flag-ship,\r\ncalls the most complete naval victory ever gained. It was so indeed at\r\nthat time,--the most complete, but not the most decisive, as it\r\nperhaps might have been. The French, according to Hoste, lost not even\r\na boat, much less a ship, which, if true, makes yet more culpable the\r\nsluggishness of the pursuit; while the allies fled, casting sixteen of\r\ntheir ships ashore and burning them in sight of the enemy, who pursued\r\nas far as the Downs. The English indeed give the allied loss as only\r\neight ships,--an estimate probably full as much out one way as the\r\nFrench the other. Herbert took his fleet to the Thames, and baffled\r\nthe enemy's further pursuit by removing the buoys.[71]\r\n\r\nTourville's is the only great historical name among the seamen of this\r\nwar, if we except the renowned privateersmen at whose head was Jean\r\nBart. Among the English, extraordinary merit cannot be claimed for any\r\none of the gallant and enterprising men who commanded squadrons.\r\nTourville, who by this time had served afloat for nearly thirty\r\nyears, was at once a seaman and a military man. With superb courage,\r\nof which he had given dazzling examples in his youth, he had seen\r\nservice wherever the French fleets had fought,--in the Anglo-Dutch\r\nwar, in the Mediterranean, and against the Barbary pirates. Reaching\r\nthe rank of admiral, he commanded in person all the largest fleets\r\nsent out during the earlier years of this war, and he brought to the\r\ncommand a scientific knowledge of tactics, based upon both theory and\r\nexperience, joined to that practical acquaintance with the seaman's\r\nbusiness which is necessary in order to apply tactical principles upon\r\nthe ocean to the best advantage. But with all these high qualities he\r\nseems to have failed, where so many warriors fail, in the ability to\r\nassume a great responsibility.[72] The caution in his pursuit of the\r\nallies after Beachy Head, though so different in appearance, came from\r\nthe same trait which impelled him two years later to lead his fleet\r\ninto almost certain destruction at La Hougue, because he had the\r\nking's order in his pocket. He was brave enough to do anything, but\r\nnot strong enough to bear the heaviest burdens. Tourville was in fact\r\nthe forerunner of the careful and skilful tacticians of the coming\r\nera, but with the savor still of the impetuous hard-fighting which\r\ncharacterized the sea commanders of the seventeenth century. He\r\ndoubtless felt, after Beachy Head, that he had done very well and\r\ncould be satisfied; but he could not have acted as he did had he felt,\r\nto use Nelson's words, that \"if we had taken ten ships out of the\r\nenemy's eleven, and let the eleventh escape, being able to take her, I\r\ncould never call such a good day.\"\r\n\r\nThe day after the sea fight off Beachy Head, with its great but still\r\npartial results, the cause of James II. was lost ashore in Ireland.\r\nThe army which William had been allowed to transport there unmolested\r\nwas superior in number and quality to that of James, as William\r\nhimself was superior as a leader to the ex-king. The counsel of Louis\r\nXIV. was that James should avoid decisive action, retiring if\r\nnecessary to the Shannon, in the midst of a country wholly devoted to\r\nhim. It was, however, a good deal to ask, this abandonment of the\r\ncapital after more than a year's occupancy, with all the consequent\r\nmoral effect; it would have been much more to the purpose to stop\r\nWilliam's landing. James undertook to cover Dublin, taking up the line\r\nof the river Boyne, and there on the 11th of July the two armies met,\r\nwith the result that James was wholly defeated. The king himself fled\r\nto Kinsale, where he found ten of those frigates that had been meant\r\nto control St. George's Channel. He embarked, and again took refuge in\r\nFrance, begging Louis to improve the victory at Beachy Head by landing\r\nhim with another French army in England itself. Louis angrily refused,\r\nand directed that the troops still remaining in Ireland should be at\r\nonce withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe chances of a rising in favor of James, at least upon the shores of\r\nthe Channel, if they existed at all, were greatly exaggerated by his\r\nown imagination. After the safe retreat of the allied fleet to the\r\nThames, Tourville, in accordance with his instructions, made several\r\ndemonstrations in the south of England; but they were wholly fruitless\r\nin drawing out any show of attachment to the Stuart cause.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland it was different. The Irish army with its French contingent\r\nfell back, after the battle of the Boyne, to the Shannon, and there\r\nagain made a stand; while Louis, receding from his first angry\r\nimpulse, continued to send reinforcements and supplies. But the\r\nincreasing urgency of the continental war kept him from affording\r\nenough support, and the war in Ireland came to a close a little over a\r\nyear later, by the defeat at Aghrim and capitulation of Limerick. The\r\nbattle of the Boyne, which from its peculiar religious coloring has\r\nobtained a somewhat factitious celebrity, may be taken as the date at\r\nwhich the English crown was firmly fixed on William's head. Yet it\r\nwould be more accurate to say that the success of William, and with it\r\nthe success of Europe against Louis XIV. in the War of the League of\r\nAugsburg, was due to the mistakes and failure of the French naval\r\ncampaign in 1690; though in that campaign was won the most conspicuous\r\nsingle success the French have ever gained at sea over the English. As\r\nregards the more striking military operations, it is curious to remark\r\nthat Tourville sailed the day after William left Chester, and won\r\nBeachy Head the day before the battle of the Boyne; but the real\r\nfailure lay in permitting William to transport that solid body of men\r\nwithout hindrance. It might have been favorable to French policy to\r\nlet him get into Ireland, but not with such a force at his back. The\r\nresult of the Irish campaign was to settle William safely on the\r\nEnglish throne and establish the Anglo-Dutch alliance; and the union\r\nof the two sea peoples under one crown was the pledge, through their\r\ncommercial and maritime ability, and the wealth they drew from the\r\nsea, of the successful prosecution of the war by their allies on the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe year 1691 was distinguished by only one great maritime event. This\r\nwas ever afterward known in France as Tourville's \"deep-sea\" or\r\n\"off-shore\" cruise; and the memory of it as a brilliant strategic and\r\ntactical display remains to this day in the French navy. That staying\r\npower, which has already been spoken of as distinctive of nations\r\nwhose sea power is not a mere military institution, but based upon the\r\ncharacter and pursuits of the people, had now come into play with the\r\nallies. Notwithstanding the defeat and loss of Beachy Head, the united\r\nfleets took the sea in 1691 with one hundred ships-of-the-line under\r\nthe command of Admiral Russell. Tourville could only gather\r\nseventy-two, the same number as the year before. \"With these he left\r\nBrest June 25. As the enemy had not yet appeared upon the coasts of\r\nthe Channel, he took up his cruising ground at the entrance, sending\r\nlookout ships in all directions. Informed that the allies had\r\nstationed themselves near the Scilly Islands to cover the passage of a\r\nconvoy expected from the Levant, Tourville did not hesitate to steer\r\nfor the English coasts, where the approaching arrival of another\r\nmerchant fleet from Jamaica was equally expected. Deceiving the\r\nEnglish cruisers by false courses, he reached the latter fleet, took\r\nfrom it several ships, and dispersed it before Russell could come up\r\nto fight him. When at last Tourville was in presence of the allied\r\nfleet, he manoeuvred so skilfully, always keeping the weather-gage,\r\nthat the enemy, drawn far out into the ocean, lost fifty days without\r\nfinding an opportunity to engage. During this time French privateers,\r\nscattered throughout the Channel, harassed the enemy's commerce and\r\nprotected convoys sent into Ireland. Worn out by fruitless efforts,\r\nRussell steered for the Irish coast. Tourville, after having protected\r\nthe return of the French convoys, anchored again in Brest Roads.\"\r\n\r\nThe actual captures made by Tourville's own fleet were insignificant,\r\nbut its service to the commerce-destroying warfare of the French, by\r\noccupying the allies, is obvious; nevertheless, the loss of English\r\ncommerce was not as great this year as the next. The chief losses of\r\nthe allies seem to have been in the Dutch North Sea trade.\r\n\r\nThe two wars, continental and maritime, that were being waged, though\r\nsimultaneous, were as yet independent of each other. It is unnecessary\r\nin connection with our subject to mention the operations of the\r\nformer. In 1692 there occurred the great disaster to the French fleet\r\nwhich is known as the battle of La Hougue. In itself, considered\r\ntactically, it possesses little importance, and the actual results\r\nhave been much exaggerated; but popular report has made it one of the\r\nfamous sea battles of the world, and therefore it cannot be wholly\r\npassed by.\r\n\r\nMisled by reports from England, and still more by the representations\r\nof James, who fondly nursed his belief that the attachment of many\r\nEnglish naval officers to his person was greater than their love of\r\ncountry or faithfulness to their trust, Louis XIV. determined to\r\nattempt an invasion of the south coast of England, led by James in\r\nperson. As a first step thereto, Tourville, at the head of between\r\nfifty and sixty ships-of-the-line, thirteen of which were to come\r\nfrom Toulon, was to engage the English fleet; from which so many\r\ndesertions were expected as would, with the consequent demoralization,\r\nyield the French an easy and total victory. The first hitch was in the\r\nfailure of the Toulon fleet, delayed by contrary winds, to join; and\r\nTourville went to sea with only forty-four ships, but with a\r\nperemptory order from the king to fight when he fell in with the\r\nenemy, were they few or many, and come what might.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of May, Tourville saw the allies to the northward and\r\neastward; they numbered ninety-nine sail-of-the-line. The wind being\r\nsouthwest, he had the choice of engaging, but first summoned all the\r\nflag-officers on board his own ship, and put the question to them\r\nwhether he ought to fight. They all said not, and he then handed them\r\nthe order of the king.[73] No one dared dispute that; though, had they\r\nknown it, light vessels with contrary orders were even then searching\r\nfor the fleet. The other officers then returned to their ships, and\r\nthe whole fleet kept away together for the allies, who waited for\r\nthem, on the starboard tack, heading south-southeast, the Dutch\r\noccupying the van, the English the centre and rear. When they were\r\nwithin easy range, the French hauled their wind on the same tack,\r\nkeeping the weather-gage. Tourville, being so inferior in numbers,\r\ncould not wholly avoid the enemy's line extending to the rear of his\r\nown, which was also necessarily weak from its extreme length; but he\r\navoided Herbert's error at Beachy Head, keeping his van refused with\r\nlong intervals between the ships, to check the enemy's van, and\r\nengaging closely with his centre and rear (Plate VIa. A, A, A). It is\r\nnot necessary to follow the phases of this unequal fight; the\r\nextraordinary result was that when the firing ceased at night, in\r\nconsequence of a thick fog and calm, not a single French ship had\r\nstruck her colors nor been sunk. No higher proof of military spirit\r\nand efficiency could be given by any navy, and Tourville's seamanship\r\nand tactical ability contributed largely to the result, which it must\r\nalso be confessed was not creditable to the allies. The two fleets\r\nanchored at nightfall (B, B, B), a body of English ships (B')\r\nremaining to the southward and westward of the French, Later on, these\r\ncut their cables and allowed themselves to drift through the French\r\nline in order to rejoin their main body; in doing which they were\r\nroughly handled.\r\n\r\nHaving amply vindicated the honor of his fleet, and shown the\r\nuselessness of further fighting, Tourville now thought of retreat,\r\nwhich was begun at midnight with a light northeast wind and continued\r\nall the next day. The allies pursued, the movements of the French\r\nbeing much embarrassed by the crippled condition of the flag-ship\r\n\"Royal Sun,\" the finest ship in the French navy, which the admiral\r\ncould not make up his mind to destroy. The direction of the main\r\nretreat was toward the Channel Islands, thirty-five ships being with\r\nthe admiral; of them twenty passed with the tidal current through the\r\ndangerous passage known as the Race of Alderney, between the island of\r\nthat name and the mainland, and got safe to St. Malo. Before the\r\nremaining fifteen could follow, the tide changed; and the anchors\r\nwhich had been dropped dragging, these ships were carried to the\r\neastward and to leeward of the enemy. Three sought refuge in\r\nCherbourg, which had then neither breakwater nor port, the remaining\r\ntwelve at Cape La Hougue; and they were all burned either by their own\r\ncrews or by the allies. The French thus lost fifteen of the finest\r\nships in their navy, the least of which carried sixty guns; but this\r\nwas little more than the loss of the allies at Beachy Head. The\r\nimpression made upon the public mind, accustomed to the glories and\r\nsuccesses of Louis XIV., was out of all proportion to the results, and\r\nblotted out the memory of the splendid self-devotion of Tourville and\r\nhis followers. La Hougue was also the last general action fought by\r\nthe French fleet, which did rapidly dwindle away in the following\r\nyears, so that this disaster seemed to be its death-blow. As a matter\r\nof fact, however, Tourville went to sea the next year with seventy\r\nships, and the losses were at the time repaired. The decay of the\r\nFrench navy was not due to any one defeat, but to the exhaustion of\r\nFrance and the great cost of the continental war; and this war was\r\nmainly sustained by the two sea peoples whose union was secured by the\r\nsuccess of William in the Irish campaign. Without asserting that the\r\nresult would have been different had the naval operations of France\r\nbeen otherwise directed in 1690, it may safely be said that their\r\nmisdirection was the immediate cause of things turning out as they\r\ndid, and the first cause of the decay of the French navy.\r\n\r\nThe five remaining years of the War of the League of Augsburg, in\r\nwhich all Europe was in arms against France, are marked by no great\r\nsea battles, nor any single maritime event of the first importance. To\r\nappreciate the effect of the sea power of the allies, it is necessary\r\nto sum up and condense an account of the quiet, steady pressure which\r\nit brought to bear and maintained in all quarters against France. It\r\nis thus indeed that sea power usually acts, and just because so quiet\r\nin its working, it is the more likely to be unnoticed and must be\r\nsomewhat carefully pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe head of the opposition to Louis XIV. was William III., and his\r\ntastes being military rather than naval combined with the direction of\r\nLouis' policy to make the active war continental rather than maritime;\r\nwhile the gradual withdrawal of the great French fleets, by leaving\r\nthe allied navies without enemies on the sea, worked in the same way.\r\nFurthermore, the efficiency of the English navy, which was double in\r\nnumbers that of the Dutch, was at this time at a low pitch; the\r\ndemoralizing effects of the reign of Charles II. could not be wholly\r\novercome during the three years of his brother's rule, and there was a\r\nyet more serious cause of trouble growing out of the political state\r\nof England. It has been said that James believed the naval officers\r\nand seamen to be attached to his person; and, whether justly or\r\nunjustly, this thought was also in the minds of the present rulers,\r\ncausing doubts of the loyalty and trustworthiness of many officers,\r\nand tending to bring confusion into the naval administration. We are\r\ntold that \"the complaints made by the merchants were extremely well\r\nsupported, and showed the folly of preferring unqualified men to that\r\nboard which directed the naval power of England; and yet the mischief\r\ncould not be amended, because the more experienced people who had been\r\nlong in the service were thought disaffected, and it appeared the\r\nremedy might have proved worse than the disease.\"[74] Suspicion\r\nreigned in the cabinet and the city, factions and irresolution among\r\nthe officers; and a man who was unfortunate or incapable in action\r\nknew that the yet more serious charge of treason might follow his\r\nmisadventure.\r\n\r\nAfter La Hougue, the direct military action of the allied navies was\r\nexerted in three principal ways, the first being in attacks upon the\r\nFrench ports, especially those in the Channel and near Brest. These\r\nhad rarely in view more than local injury and the destruction of\r\nshipping, particularly in the ports whence the French privateers\r\nissued; and although on some occasions the number of troops embarked\r\nwas large, William proposed to himself little more than the diversion\r\nwhich such threats caused, by forcing Louis to take troops from the\r\nfield for coast defence. It may be said generally of all these\r\nenterprises against the French coast, in this and later wars, that\r\nthey effected little, and even as a diversion did not weaken the\r\nFrench armies to any great extent. If the French ports had been less\r\nwell defended, or French water-ways open into the heart of the\r\ncountry, like our own Chesapeake and Delaware bays and the Southern\r\nsounds, the result might have been different.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the allied navies were of great direct military\r\nvalue, though they fought no battles, when Louis XIV. decided in 1694\r\nto make his war against Spain offensive. Spain, though so weak in\r\nherself, was yet troublesome from her position in the rear of France;\r\nand Louis finally concluded to force her to peace by carrying the war\r\ninto Catalonia, on the northeast coast. The movement of his armies was\r\nseconded by his fleet under Tourville; and the reduction of that\r\ndifficult province went on rapidly until the approach of the allied\r\nnavies in largely superior force caused Tourville to retire to Toulon.\r\nThis saved Barcelona; and from that time until the two sea nations had\r\ndetermined to make peace, they kept their fleets on the Spanish coast\r\nand arrested the French advance. When, in 1697, William had become\r\ndisposed to peace and Spain refused it, Louis again invaded, the\r\nallied fleet did not appear, and Barcelona fell. At the same time a\r\nFrench naval expedition was successfully directed against Cartagena in\r\nSouth America, and under the two blows, both of which depended upon\r\nthe control of the sea, Spain yielded.\r\n\r\nThe third military function of the allied navies was the protection of\r\ntheir sea commerce; and herein, if history may be trusted, they\r\ngreatly failed. At no time has war against commerce been conducted on\r\na larger scale and with greater results than during this period; and\r\nits operations were widest and most devastating at the very time that\r\nthe great French fleets were disappearing, in the years immediately\r\nafter La Hougue, apparently contradicting the assertion that such a\r\nwarfare must be based on powerful fleets or neighboring seaports. A\r\nsomewhat full discussion is due, inasmuch as the distress to commerce\r\nwrought by the privateers was a large factor in bringing the sea\r\nnations to wish for peace; just as the subsidies, which their\r\ncommerce enabled them to pay the continental armies, besides keeping\r\nup their own, were the chief means by which the war was prolonged and\r\nFrance brought to terms. The attack and defence of commerce is still a\r\nliving question.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is to be observed that the decay of the French\r\nfleet was gradual, and that the moral effect of its appearance in the\r\nChannel, its victory at Beachy Head, and gallant conduct at La Hougue\r\nremained for some time impressed on the minds of the allies. This\r\nimpression caused their ships to be kept together in fleets, instead\r\nof scattering in pursuit of the enemy's cruisers, and so brought to\r\nthe latter a support almost equal to an active warfare on the seas.\r\nAgain, the efficiency of the English navy, as has been said, was low,\r\nand its administration perhaps worse; while treason in England gave\r\nthe French the advantage of better information. Thus in the year\r\nfollowing La Hougue, the French, having received accurate information\r\nof a great convoy sailing for Smyrna, sent out Tourville in May,\r\ngetting him to sea before the allies were ready to blockade him in\r\nBrest, as they had intended. This delay was due to bad administration,\r\nas was also the further misfortune that the English government did not\r\nlearn of Tourville's departure until after its own fleet had sailed\r\nwith the trade. Tourville surprised the convoy near the Straits,\r\ndestroyed or captured one hundred out of four hundred ships, and\r\nscattered the rest. This is not a case of simple cruising warfare, for\r\nTourville's fleet was of seventy-one ships; but it shows the\r\nincompetency of the English administration. In truth, it was\r\nimmediately after La Hougue that the depredations of cruisers became\r\nmost ruinous; and the reason was twofold: first, the allied fleet was\r\nkept together at Spithead for two months and more, gathering troops\r\nfor a landing on the continent, thus leaving the cruisers unmolested;\r\nand in the second place, the French, not being able to send their\r\nfleet out again that summer, permitted the seamen to take service in\r\nprivate ships, thus largely increasing the numbers of the latter. The\r\ntwo causes working together gave an impunity and extension to\r\ncommerce-destroying which caused a tremendous outcry in England. \"It\r\nmust be confessed,\" says the English naval chronicler, \"that our\r\ncommerce suffered far less the year before, when the French were\r\nmasters at sea, than in this, when their grand fleet was blocked up in\r\nport.\" But the reason was that the French having little commerce and a\r\ncomparatively large number of seamen, mainly employed in the fleet,\r\nwere able, when this lay by, to release them to cruisers. As the\r\npressure of the war became greater, and Louis continued to reduce the\r\nnumber of his ships in commission, another increase was given to the\r\ncommerce-destroyers. \"The ships and officers of the royal navy were\r\nloaned, under certain conditions, to private firms, or to companies\r\nwho wished to undertake privateering enterprises, in which even the\r\ncabinet ministers did not disdain to take shares;\" indeed, they were\r\nurged to do so to please the king. The conditions generally provided\r\nthat a certain proportion of the profits should go to the king, in\r\nreturn for the use of the ships. Such employment would be demoralizing\r\nto any military service, but not necessarily all at once; and the\r\nconditions imparted for the time a tone and energy to privateering\r\nthat it cannot always have. In truth, the public treasury, not being\r\nable to maintain the navy, associated with itself private capital,\r\nrisking only material otherwise useless, and looking for returns to\r\nrobbing the enemy. The commerce-destroying of this war, also, was no\r\nmere business of single cruisers; squadrons of three or four up to\r\nhalf a dozen ships acted together under one man, and it is only just\r\nto say that under seamen like Jean Bart, Forbin, and Duguay-Trouin,\r\nthey were even more ready to fight than to pillage. The largest of\r\nthese private expeditions, and the only one that went far from the\r\nFrench shores, was directed in 1697 against Cartagena, on the Spanish\r\nMain. It numbered seven ships-of-the-line and six frigates, besides\r\nsmaller vessels, and carried twenty-eight hundred troops. The chief\r\nobject was to lay a contribution on the city of Cartagena; but its\r\neffect on the policy of Spain was marked, and led to peace. Such a\r\ntemper and concert of action went far to supply the place of\r\nsupporting fleets, but could not wholly do so; and although the allies\r\ncontinued to keep their large fleets together, still, as the war went\r\non and efficiency of administration improved, commerce-destroying was\r\nbrought within bounds. At the same time, as an evidence of how much\r\nthe unsupported cruisers suffered, even under these favorable\r\nconditions, it may be mentioned that the English report fifty-nine\r\nships-of-war captured against eighteen admitted by the French during\r\nthe war,--a difference which a French naval historian attributes, with\r\nmuch probability, to the English failing to distinguish between\r\nships-of-war properly so called, and those loaned to private firms.\r\nCaptures of actual privateers do not appear in the list quoted from.\r\n\"The commerce-destroying of this war, therefore, was marked by the\r\nparticular characteristics of cruisers acting together in squadron,\r\nnot far from their base, while the enemy thought best to keep his\r\nfleet concentrated elsewhere; notwithstanding which, and the bad\r\nadministration of the English navy, the cruisers were more and more\r\ncontrolled as the great French fleets disappeared.\" The results of the\r\nwar of 1689-1697 do not therefore vitiate the general conclusion that\r\n\"a cruising, commerce-destroying warfare, to be destructive, must be\r\nseconded by a squadron warfare, and by divisions of ships-of-the-line;\r\nwhich, forcing the enemy to unite his forces, permit the cruisers to\r\nmake fortunate attempts upon his trade. Without such backing the\r\nresult will be simply the capture of the cruisers.\" Toward the end of\r\nthis war the real tendency was becoming manifest, and was still more\r\nplainly seen in the next, when the French navy had sunk to a yet lower\r\nstate of weakness.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their losses, the sea nations made good their cause.\r\nThe war, which began with the French taking the offensive, ended by\r\nreducing them everywhere to the defensive, and forced Louis to do\r\nviolence at once to his strongest prejudices and his most reasonable\r\npolitical wishes, by recognizing as king of England him whom he looked\r\nupon as a usurper as well as his own inveterate enemy. On its\r\nsurface, and taken as a whole, this war will appear almost wholly a\r\nland struggle, extending from the Spanish Netherlands down the line of\r\nthe Rhine, to Savoy in Italy and Catalonia in Spain. The sea fights in\r\nthe Channel, the Irish struggle receding in the distance, look like\r\nmere episodes; while the underlying action of trade and commerce is\r\nwholly disregarded, or noticed only as their outcries tell of their\r\nsufferings. Yet trade and shipping not only bore the burden of\r\nsuffering, but in the main paid the armies that were fighting the\r\nFrench; and this turning of the stream of wealth from both sea nations\r\ninto the coffers of their allies was perhaps determined, certainly\r\nhastened, by the misdirection of that naval supremacy with which\r\nFrance began the war. It was then possible, as it will usually be\r\npossible, for a really fine military navy of superior force to strike\r\nan overwhelming blow at a less ready rival; but the opportunity was\r\nallowed to slip, and the essentially stronger, better founded sea\r\npower of the allies had time to assert itself.\r\n\r\nThe peace signed at Ryswick in 1697 was most disadvantageous to\r\nFrance; she lost all that had been gained since the Peace of Nimeguen,\r\nnineteen years before, with the single important exception of\r\nStrasburg. All that Louis XIV. had gained by trick or force during the\r\nyears of peace was given up. Immense restitutions were made to Germany\r\nand to Spain. In so far as the latter were made in the Netherlands,\r\nthey were to the immediate advantage of the United Provinces, and\r\nindeed of all Europe as well as of Spain. To the two sea nations the\r\nterms of the treaty gave commercial benefits, which tended to the\r\nincrease of their own sea power and to the consequent injury of that\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nFrance had made a gigantic struggle; to stand alone as she did then,\r\nand as she has since done more than once, against all Europe is a\r\ngreat feat. Yet it may be said that as the United Provinces taught the\r\nlesson that a nation, however active and enterprising, cannot rest\r\nupon external resources alone, if intrinsically weak in numbers and\r\nterritory, so France in its measure shows that a nation cannot\r\nsubsist indefinitely off itself, however powerful in numbers and\r\nstrong in internal resources.\r\n\r\nIt is said that a friend once found Colbert looking dreamily from his\r\nwindows, and on questioning him as to the subject of his meditations,\r\nreceived this reply: \"In contemplating the fertile fields before my\r\neyes, I recall those which I have seen elsewhere; what a rich country\r\nis France!\" This conviction supported him amid the many\r\ndiscouragements of his official life, when struggling to meet the\r\nfinancial difficulties arising from the extravagance and wars of the\r\nking; and it has been justified by the whole course of the nation's\r\nhistory since his days. France is rich in natural resources as well as\r\nin the industry and thrift of her people. But neither individual\r\nnations nor men can thrive when severed from natural intercourse with\r\ntheir kind; whatever the native vigor of constitution, it requires\r\nhealthful surroundings, and freedom to draw to itself from near and\r\nfrom far all that is conducive to its growth and strength and general\r\nwelfare. Not only must the internal organism work satisfactorily, the\r\nprocesses of decay and renewal, of movement and circulation, go on\r\neasily, but, from sources external to themselves, both mind and body\r\nmust receive healthful and varied nourishment. With all her natural\r\ngifts France wasted away because of the want of that lively\r\nintercourse between the different parts of her own body and constant\r\nexchange with other people, which is known as commerce, internal or\r\nexternal. To say that war was the cause of these defects is to state\r\nat least a partial truth; but it does not exhaust the matter. War,\r\nwith its many acknowledged sufferings, is above all harmful when it\r\ncuts a nation off from others and throws it back upon itself. There\r\nmay indeed be periods when such rude shocks have a bracing effect, but\r\nthey are exceptional, and of short duration, and they do not\r\ninvalidate the general statement. Such isolation was the lot of France\r\nduring the later wars of Louis XIV., and it well-nigh destroyed her;\r\nwhereas to save her from the possibility of such stagnation was the\r\ngreat aim of Colbert's life.\r\n\r\nWar alone could not entail it, if only war could be postponed until\r\nthe processes of circulation within and without the kingdom were\r\nestablished and in vigorous operation. They did not exist when he took\r\noffice; they had to be both created and firmly rooted in order to\r\nwithstand the blast of war. Time was not given to accomplish this\r\ngreat work, nor did Louis XIV. support the schemes of his minister by\r\nturning the budding energies of his docile and devoted subjects into\r\npaths favorable to it. So when the great strain came upon the powers\r\nof the nation, instead of drawing strength from every quarter and\r\nthrough many channels, and laying the whole outside world under\r\ncontribution by the energy of its merchants and seamen, as England has\r\ndone in like straits, it was thrown back upon itself, cut off from the\r\nworld by the navies of England and Holland, and the girdle of enemies\r\nwhich surrounded it upon the continent. The only escape from this\r\nprocess of gradual starvation was by an effectual control of the sea;\r\nthe creation of a strong sea power which should insure free play for\r\nthe wealth of the land and the industry of the people. For this, too,\r\nFrance had great natural advantages in her three seaboards, on the\r\nChannel, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean; and politically she had\r\nhad the fair opportunity of joining to her own maritime power that of\r\nthe Dutch in friendly alliance, hostile or at least wary toward\r\nEngland. In the pride of his strength, conscious of absolute control\r\nin his kingdom, Louis cast away this strong reinforcement to his\r\npower, and proceeded to rouse Europe against him by repeated\r\naggressions. In the period which we have just considered, France\r\njustified his confidence by a magnificent, and upon the whole\r\nsuccessful, maintenance of his attitude against all Europe; she did\r\nnot advance, but neither did she greatly recede. But this display of\r\npower was exhausting; it ate away the life of the nation, because it\r\ndrew wholly upon itself and not upon the outside world, with which it\r\ncould have been kept in contact by the sea. In the war that next\r\nfollowed, the same energy is seen, but not the same vitality; and\r\nFrance was everywhere beaten back and brought to the verge of ruin.\r\nThe lesson of both is the same; nations, like men, however strong,\r\ndecay when cut off from the external activities and resources which at\r\nonce draw out and support their internal powers. A nation, as we have\r\nalready shown, cannot live indefinitely off itself, and the easiest\r\nway by which it can communicate with other peoples and renew its own\r\nstrength is the sea.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[66] Campbell: Lives of the Admirals.\r\n\r\n[67] Martin: History of France.\r\n\r\n[68] See Map of English Channel, etc., p. 107.\r\n\r\n[69] That is, nearly motionless.\r\n\r\n[70] Hoste: Naval Tactics.\r\n\r\n[71] Ledyard says the order to remove the buoys was not carried out\r\n(Naval History, vol. ii. p. 636).\r\n\r\n[72] Seignelay, the French minister of marine of the day, called him\r\n\"poltron de tête, mais pas de coeur.\"\r\n\r\n[73] The author has followed in the text the traditional and generally\r\naccepted account of Tourville's orders and the motives of his action.\r\nA French writer, M. de Crisenoy, in a very interesting paper upon the\r\nsecret history preceding and accompanying the event, traverses many of\r\nthese traditional statements. According to him, Louis XIV. was not\r\nunder any illusion as to the loyalty of the English officers to their\r\nflag; and the instructions given to Tourville, while peremptory under\r\ncertain conditions, did not compel him to fight in the situation of\r\nthe French fleet on the day of the battle. The tone of the\r\ninstructions, however, implied dissatisfaction with the admiral's\r\naction in previous cruises, probably in the pursuit after Beachy Head,\r\nand a consequent doubt of his vigor in the campaign then beginning.\r\nMortification therefore impelled him to the desperate attack on the\r\nallied fleet; and, according to M. de Crisenoy, the council of war in\r\nthe admiral's cabin, and the dramatic production of the king's orders,\r\nhad no existence in fact.\r\n\r\n[74] Campbell: Lives of the Admirals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION, 1702-1713.--SEA BATTLE OF MALAGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last thirty years of the seventeenth century, amid all the\r\nstrifes of arms and diplomacy, there had been clearly foreseen the\r\ncoming of an event which would raise new and great issues. This was\r\nthe failure of the direct royal line in that branch of the House of\r\nAustria which was then on the Spanish throne; and the issues to be\r\ndetermined when the present king, infirm both in body and mind, should\r\ndie, were whether the new monarch was to be taken from the House of\r\nBourbon or from the Austrian family in Germany; and whether, in either\r\nevent, the sovereign thus raised to the throne should succeed to the\r\nentire inheritance, the Empire of Spain, or some partition of that\r\nvast inheritance be made in the interests of the balance of European\r\npower. But this balance of power was no longer understood in the\r\nnarrow sense of continental possessions; the effect of the new\r\narrangements upon commerce, shipping, and the control both of the\r\nocean and the Mediterranean, was closely looked to. The influence of\r\nthe two sea powers and the nature of their interests were becoming\r\nmore evident.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to recall the various countries that were ruled by\r\nSpain at that time in order to understand the strategic questions, as\r\nthey may fairly be called, now to be settled. These were, in Europe,\r\nthe Netherlands (now Belgium); Naples and the south of Italy; Milan\r\nand other provinces in the north; and, in the Mediterranean, Sicily,\r\nSardinia, and the Balearic Isles. Corsica at that time belonged to\r\nGenoa. In the western hemisphere, besides Cuba and Porto Rico, Spain\r\nthen held all that part of the continent now divided among the\r\nSpanish American States, a region whose vast commercial possibilities\r\nwere coming to be understood; and in the Asian archipelago there were\r\nlarge possessions that entered less into the present dispute. The\r\nexcessive weakness of this empire, owing to the decay of the central\r\nkingdom, had hitherto caused other nations, occupied as they were with\r\nmore immediate interests, to regard with indifference its enormous\r\nextent. This indifference could not last when there was a prospect of\r\na stronger administration, backed possibly by alliances with one of\r\nthe great powers of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt would be foreign to our subject to enter into the details of\r\ndiplomatic arrangement, which, by shifting about peoples and\r\nterritories from one ruler to another, sought to reach a political\r\nbalance peacefully. The cardinal points of each nation's policy may be\r\nshortly stated. The Spanish cabinet and people objected to any\r\nsolution which dismembered the empire. The English and the Dutch\r\nobjected to any extension of France in the Spanish Netherlands, and to\r\nthe monopoly by the French of the trade with Spanish America, both\r\nwhich they feared as the results of placing a Bourbon on the Spanish\r\nthrone. Louis XIV. wanted Naples and Sicily for one of his sons, in\r\ncase of any partition; thus giving France a strong Mediterranean\r\nposition, but one which would be at the mercy of the sea powers,--a\r\nfact which induced William III. to acquiesce in this demand. The\r\nEmperor of Austria particularly objected to these Mediterranean\r\npositions going away from his family, and refused to come into any of\r\nthe partition treaties. Before any arrangement was perfected, the\r\nactual king of Spain died, but before his death was induced by his\r\nministers to sign a will, bequeathing all his States to the grandson\r\nof Louis XIV., then Duke of Anjou, known afterward as Philip V. of\r\nSpain. By this step it was hoped to preserve the whole, by enlisting\r\nin its defence the nearest and one of the most powerful States in\r\nEurope,--nearest, if are excepted the powers ruling the sea, which are\r\nalways near any country whose ports are open to their ships.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. accepted the bequest, and in so doing felt bound in honor\r\nto resist all attempts at partition. The union of the two kingdoms\r\nunder one family promised important advantages to France, henceforth\r\ndelivered from that old enemy in the rear, which had balked so many of\r\nher efforts to extend her frontiers eastward. As a matter of fact,\r\nfrom that time, with rare breaks, there existed between the two\r\nkingdoms an alliance, the result of family ties, which only the\r\nweakness of Spain kept from being dangerous to the rest of Europe. The\r\nother countries at once realized the situation, and nothing could have\r\nsaved war but some backward step on the part of the French king. The\r\nstatesmen of England and Holland, the two powers on whose wealth the\r\nthreatened war must depend, proposed that the Italian States should be\r\ngiven to the son of the Austrian emperor, Belgium be occupied by\r\nthemselves, and that the new king of Spain should grant no commercial\r\nprivileges in the Indies to France above other nations. To the credit\r\nof their wisdom it must be said that this compromise was the one which\r\nafter ten years of war was found, on the whole, best; and in it is\r\nseen the growing sense of the value of extension by sea. Louis,\r\nhowever, would not yield; on the contrary, he occupied, by connivance\r\nof the Spanish governors, towns in the Netherlands which had been held\r\nby Dutch troops under treaties with Spain. Soon after, in February,\r\n1701, the English Parliament met, and denounced any treaty which\r\npromised France the dominion of the Mediterranean. Holland began to\r\narm, and the Emperor of Austria pushed his troops into northern Italy,\r\nwhere a campaign followed, greatly to the disadvantage of Louis.\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year, 1701, the two sea powers and the\r\nEmperor of Austria signed a secret treaty, which laid down the chief\r\nlines of the coming war, with the exception of that waged in the\r\nSpanish peninsula itself. By it the allies undertook to conquer the\r\nSpanish Netherlands in order to place a barrier between France and the\r\nUnited Provinces; to conquer Milan as a security for the emperor's\r\nother provinces; and to conquer Naples and Sicily for the same\r\nsecurity, and also for the security of the navigation and commerce of\r\nthe subjects of his Britannic Majesty and of the United Provinces. The\r\nsea powers should have the right to conquer, for the utility of the\r\nsaid navigation and commerce, the countries and towns of the Spanish\r\nIndies; and all that they should be able to take there should be for\r\nthem and remain theirs. The war begun, none of the allies could treat\r\nwithout the others, nor without having taken just measures--first, to\r\nprevent the kingdoms of France and Spain from ever being united under\r\nthe same king; second, to prevent the French from ever making\r\nthemselves masters of the Spanish Indies, or from sending ships\r\nthither to engage, directly or indirectly, in commerce; third, to\r\nsecure to the subjects of his Britannic Majesty and of the United\r\nProvinces the commercial privileges which they enjoyed in all the\r\nSpanish States under the late king.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in these conditions there is no suggestion of\r\nany intention to resist the accession of the Bourbon king, who was\r\ncalled to the throne by the Spanish government and at first\r\nacknowledged by England and Holland; but, on the other hand, the\r\nEmperor of Austria does not withdraw the Austrian claim, which centred\r\nin his own person. The voice of the sea powers was paramount in the\r\ncoalition, as the terms of the treaty safeguarding their commercial\r\ninterests show, though, as they were about to use German armies for\r\nthe land war, German claims also had to be considered. As a French\r\nhistorian points out:--\r\n\r\n    \"This was really a new treaty of partition.... William III., who\r\n    had conducted all, had taken care not to exhaust England and\r\n    Holland, in order to restore the Spanish monarchy, intact, to\r\n    the emperor; his final condition was to reduce the new king,\r\n    Philip V., to Spain proper, and to secure to England and Holland\r\n    at once the commercial use of all the regions that had been\r\n    under the Spanish monarchy, together with important military and\r\n    maritime positions against France.\"[75]\r\n\r\nBut though war was imminent, the countries about to engage hesitated.\r\nHolland would not move without England, and despite the strong\r\nfeeling of the latter country against France, the manufacturers and\r\nmerchants still remembered the terrible sufferings of the last war.\r\nJust then, as the scales were wavering, James II. died. Louis,\r\nyielding to a sentiment of sympathy and urged by his nearest\r\nintimates, formally recognized the son of James as king of England;\r\nand the English people, enraged at what they looked on as a threat and\r\nan insult, threw aside all merely prudential considerations. The House\r\nof Lords declared that \"there could be no security till the usurper of\r\nthe Spanish monarchy was brought to reason;\" and the House of Commons\r\nvoted fifty thousand soldiers and thirty-five thousand seamen, besides\r\nsubsidies for German and Danish auxiliaries. William III. died soon\r\nafter, in March, 1702; but Queen Anne took up his policy, which had\r\nbecome that of the English and Dutch peoples.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. tried to break part of the on-coming storm by forming a\r\nleague of neutrals among the other German States; but the emperor\r\nadroitly made use of the German feeling, and won to his side the\r\nElector of Brandenburg by acknowledging him as king of Prussia, thus\r\ncreating a North-German Protestant royal house, around which the other\r\nProtestant States naturally gathered, and which was in the future to\r\nprove a formidable rival to Austria. The immediate result was that\r\nFrance and Spain, whose cause was thenceforth known as that of the two\r\ncrowns, went into the war without any ally save Bavaria. War was\r\ndeclared in May by Holland against the kings of France and Spain; by\r\nEngland against France and Spain, Anne refusing to recognize Philip V.\r\neven in declaring war, because he had recognized James III. as king of\r\nEngland; while the emperor was still more outspoken, declaring against\r\nthe King of France and the Duke of Anjou. Thus began the great War of\r\nthe Spanish Succession.\r\n\r\nIt is far from easy, in dealing with a war of such proportions,\r\nlasting for more than ten years, to disentangle from the general\r\nnarrative that part which particularly touches our subject, without at\r\nthe same time losing sight of the relation of the one part to the\r\nwhole. Such a loss, however, is fatal to the end in view, which is\r\nnot a mere chronicle of naval events, nor even a tactical or strategic\r\ndiscussion of certain naval problems divorced from their surroundings\r\nof cause and effect in general history, but an appreciation of the\r\neffect of sea power upon the general result of the war and upon the\r\nprosperity of nations. It will conduce to clearness, however, to point\r\nout again that the aim of William III. was not to dispute the claim of\r\nPhilip V. to the throne,--a matter of comparative indifference to the\r\nsea powers,--but to seize, to the benefit of their commerce and\r\ncolonial empire, such portions of the Spanish American possessions as\r\nhe could, and at the same time to impose such conditions upon the new\r\nmonarchy as would at least prevent any loss, to English and Dutch\r\ncommerce, of the privileges they had had under the Austrian line. Such\r\na policy would not direct the main effort of the sea nations upon the\r\nSpanish peninsula, but upon America; and the allied fleets might not\r\nhave entered the Straits. Sicily and Naples were to go, not to\r\nEngland, but to Austria. Subsequent causes led to an entire change in\r\nthis general plan. A new candidate, a son of the Emperor of Germany,\r\nwas set up in 1703 by the coalition under the name of Carlos III., and\r\nthe peninsula became the scene of a doubtful and bloody war, keeping\r\nthe Anglo-Dutch fleets hovering round the coasts; with the result, as\r\nregards the sea powers, that nothing of decisive importance was done\r\nin Spanish America, but that England issued from the strife with\r\nGibraltar and Port Mahon in her hands, to be thenceforth a\r\nMediterranean power. At the same time that Carlos III. was proclaimed,\r\na treaty was negotiated with Portugal, known as the Methuen Treaty,\r\nwhich gave England the practical monopoly of Portuguese trade, and\r\nsent the gold of Brazil by way of Lisbon to London,--an advantage so\r\ngreat that it aided materially in keeping up the war on the continent\r\nas well as in maintaining the navy. At the same time the efficiency of\r\nthe latter so increased that the losses by French cruisers, though\r\nstill heavy, were at no time unendurable.\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, in pursuance of the original policy, Sir\r\nGeorge Rooke, with a fleet of fifty ships-of-the-line and transports\r\ncarrying fourteen thousand troops, was sent against Cadiz, which was\r\nthe great European centre of the Spanish-American trade; there came\r\nthe specie and products of the West, and thence they were dispersed\r\nthrough Europe. It had been the purpose of William III. also to seize\r\nCartagena, one of the principal centres of the same trade in the other\r\nhemisphere; and to that end, six months before his death, in\r\nSeptember, 1701, he had despatched there a squadron under that\r\ntraditional seaman of the olden time, Benbow. Benbow fell in with a\r\nFrench squadron sent to supply and strengthen the place, and brought\r\nit to action north of Cartagena; but though superior in force, the\r\ntreason of several of his captains, who kept out of action, defeated\r\nhis purpose, and after fighting till his ship was helpless and he\r\nhimself had received a mortal wound, the French escaped and Cartagena\r\nwas saved. Before his death Benbow received a letter from the French\r\ncommodore to this effect: \"Yesterday morning I had no hope but I\r\nshould have supped in your cabin. As for those cowardly captains of\r\nyours, hang them up, for, by God! they deserve it.\" And hanged two of\r\nthem were. Rooke's expedition against Cadiz also failed, as it was\r\nnearly certain to do; for his instructions were so to act as to\r\nconciliate the Spanish people and disincline them to the Bourbon king.\r\nSuch doubtful orders tied his hands; but after failing there, he\r\nlearned that the galleons from the West Indies, loaded with silver and\r\nmerchandise, had put into Vigo Bay under escort of French\r\nships-of-war. He went there at once, and found the enemy in a harbor\r\nwhose entrance was but three quarters of a mile wide, defended by\r\nfortifications and a heavy boom; but a passage was forced through the\r\nboom under a hot fire, the place seized, and all the shipping, with\r\nmuch of the specie, either taken or sunk. This affair, which is known\r\nin history as that of the Vigo galleons, was a brilliant and\r\ninteresting feat of arms, but has no military features calling for\r\nmention, except the blow it gave to the finances and prestige of the\r\ntwo crowns.\r\n\r\nThe affair at Vigo had, however, important political results, and\r\nhelped to that change in the general plan of the sea powers which has\r\nbeen mentioned. The King of Portugal, moved by fear of the French, had\r\nacknowledged Philip V.; but his heart was against him, for he dreaded\r\nFrench influence and power brought so near his little and isolated\r\nkingdom. It had been a part of Rooke's mission to detach him from the\r\nalliance of the two crowns; and the affair of Vigo, happening so near\r\nhis own frontiers, impressed him with a sense of the power of the\r\nallied navies. In truth, Portugal is nearer to the sea than to Spain,\r\nand must fall naturally under the influence of the power controlling\r\nthe sea. Inducements were offered,--by the Emperor of Austria a\r\ncession of Spanish territory, by the sea powers a subsidy; but the\r\nking was not willing to declare himself until the Austrian claimant\r\nshould have landed at Lisbon, fairly committing the coalition to a\r\npeninsular as well as a continental war. The emperor transferred his\r\nclaims to his second son, Charles; and the latter, after being\r\nproclaimed in Vienna and acknowledged by England and Holland, was\r\ntaken by the allied fleets to Lisbon, where he landed in March, 1704.\r\nThis necessitated the important change in the plans of the sea powers.\r\nPledged to the support of Carlos, their fleets were thenceforth tied\r\nto the shores of the peninsula and the protection of commerce; while\r\nthe war in the West Indies, becoming a side issue on a small scale,\r\nled to no results. From this time on, Portugal was the faithful ally\r\nof England, whose sea power during this war gained its vast\r\npreponderance over all rivals. Her ports were the refuge and support\r\nof English fleets, and on Portugal was based in later days the\r\nPeninsular war with Napoleon. In and through all, Portugal, for a\r\nhundred years, had more to gain and more to fear from England than\r\nfrom any other power.\r\n\r\nGreat as were the effects of the maritime supremacy of the two sea\r\npowers upon the general result of the war, and especially upon that\r\nundisputed empire of the seas which England held for a century after,\r\nthe contest is marked by no one naval action of military interest.\r\nOnce only did great fleets meet, and then with results that were\r\nindecisive; after which the French gave up the struggle at sea,\r\nconfining themselves wholly to a commerce-destroying warfare. This\r\nfeature of the War of the Spanish Succession characterizes nearly the\r\nwhole of the eighteenth century, with the exception of the American\r\nRevolutionary struggle. The noiseless, steady, exhausting pressure\r\nwith which sea power acts, cutting off the resources of the enemy\r\nwhile maintaining its own, supporting war in scenes where it does not\r\nappear itself, or appears only in the background, and striking open\r\nblows at rare intervals, though lost to most, is emphasized to the\r\ncareful reader by the events of this war and of the half-century that\r\nfollowed. The overwhelming sea power of England was the determining\r\nfactor in European history during the period mentioned, maintaining\r\nwar abroad while keeping its own people in prosperity at home, and\r\nbuilding up the great empire which is now seen; but from its very\r\ngreatness its action, by escaping opposition, escapes attention. On\r\nthe few occasions in which it is called to fight, its superiority is\r\nso marked that the affairs can scarcely be called battles; with the\r\npossible exceptions of Byng's action at Minorca and Hawke's at\r\nQuiberon, the latter one of the most brilliant pages in naval history,\r\nno decisive encounter between equal forces, possessing military\r\ninterest, occurs between 1700 and 1778.\r\n\r\nOwing to this characteristic, the War of the Spanish Succession, from\r\nthe point of view of our subject, has to be blocked out in general\r\noutline, avoiding narrative and indicating general bearings,\r\nespecially of the actions of the fleets. With the war in Flanders, in\r\nGermany, and in Italy the navies had naturally no concern; when they\r\nhad so protected the commerce of the allies that there was no serious\r\ncheck to that flow of subsidies upon which the land war depended,\r\ntheir part toward it was done. In the Spanish peninsula it was\r\ndifferent. Immediately after landing Carlos III. at Lisbon, Sir George\r\nRooke sailed for Barcelona, which it was understood would be handed\r\nover when the fleets appeared; but the governor was faithful to his\r\nking and kept down the Austrian party. Rooke then sailed for Toulon,\r\nwhere a French fleet was at anchor. On his way he sighted another\r\nFrench fleet coming from Brest, which he chased but was unable to\r\novertake; so that both the enemy's squadrons were united in the port.\r\nIt is worth while to note here that the English navy did not as yet\r\nattempt to blockade the French ports in winter, as they did at a later\r\ndate. At this period fleets, like armies, went into winter quarters.\r\nAnother English admiral, Sir Cloudesley Shovel, had been sent in the\r\nspring to blockade Brest; but arriving too late, he found his bird\r\nflown, and at once kept on to the Mediterranean. Rooke, not thinking\r\nhimself strong enough to resist the combined French squadrons, fell\r\nback toward the Straits; for at this time England had no ports, no\r\nbase, in the Mediterranean, no useful ally; Lisbon was the nearest\r\nrefuge. Rooke and Shovel met off Lagos, and there held a council of\r\nwar, in which the former, who was senior, declared that his\r\ninstructions forbade his undertaking anything without the consent of\r\nthe kings of Spain and Portugal. This was indeed tying the hands of\r\nthe sea powers; but Rooke at last, chafing at the humiliating\r\ninaction, and ashamed to go home without doing something, decided to\r\nattack Gibraltar for three reasons: because he heard it was\r\ninsufficiently garrisoned, because it was of infinite importance as a\r\nport for the present war, and because its capture would reflect credit\r\non the queen's arms. The place was attacked, bombarded, and then\r\ncarried by an assault in boats. The English possession of Gibraltar\r\ndates from August 4, 1704, and the deed rightly keeps alive the name\r\nof Rooke, to whose judgment and fearlessness of responsibility England\r\nowes the key of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe Bourbon king of Spain at once undertook to retake the place, and\r\ncalled upon the French fleet in Toulon to support his attack.\r\nTourville had died in 1701, and the fleet was commanded by the Count\r\nof Toulouse,--a natural son of Louis XIV., only twenty-six years old.\r\nRooke also sailed eastward, and the two fleets met on the 24th of\r\nAugust off Velez Malaga. The allies were to windward with a northeast\r\nwind, both fleets on the port tack heading to the southward and\r\neastward. There is some uncertainty as to the numbers; the French had\r\nfifty-two ships-of-the-line, their enemy probably half a dozen more.\r\nThe allies kept away together, each ship for its opposite; there was\r\napparently no attempt on Rooke's part at any tactical combination. The\r\nbattle of Malaga possesses indeed no military interest, except that it\r\nis the first in which we find fully developed that wholly unscientific\r\nmethod of attack by the English which Clerk criticised, and which\r\nprevailed throughout the century. It is instructive to notice that the\r\nresult in it was the same as in all others fought on the same\r\nprinciple. The van opened out from the centre, leaving quite an\r\ninterval; and the attempt made to penetrate this gap and isolate the\r\nvan was the only tactical move of the French. We find in them at\r\nMalaga no trace of the cautious, skilful tactics which Clerk rightly\r\nthought to recognize at a later day. The degeneracy from the able\r\ncombinations of Monk, Ruyter, and Tourville to the epoch of mere\r\nseamanship is clearly marked by the battle of Malaga, and gives it its\r\nonly historical importance. In it was realized that primitive mode of\r\nfighting which Macaulay has sung, and which remained for many years\r\nthe ideal of the English navy:--\r\n\r\n    \"Then on both sides the leaders\r\n      Gave signal for the charge;\r\n    And on both sides the footmen\r\n      Strode forth with lance and targe;\r\n    And on both sides the horsemen\r\n      Struck their spurs deep in gore,\r\n    And _front to front_ the armies\r\n      Met with a mighty roar.\"\r\n\r\nHuman movement is not always advance; and there are traces of a\r\nsomewhat similar ideal in the naval periodical literature of our own\r\nday. The fight was severe, lasting from ten in the morning till five\r\nin the afternoon, but was entirely indecisive. The next day the wind\r\nshifted, giving the weather-gage to the French, but they did not use\r\nthe opportunity to attack; for which they were much to blame, if their\r\nclaim of the advantage the day before is well founded. Rooke could not\r\nhave fought; nearly half his fleet, twenty-five ships, it is said, had\r\nused up all their ammunition. Even during the battle itself several of\r\nthe allied ships were towed out of line, because they had not powder\r\nand ball for a single broadside. This was doubtless due to the attack\r\nupon Gibraltar, in which fifteen thousand shot were expended, and to\r\nthe lack of any port serving as a base of supplies,--a deficiency\r\nwhich the new possession would hereafter remove. Rooke, in seizing\r\nGibraltar, had the same object in view that prompted the United States\r\nto seize Port Royal at the beginning of the Civil War, and which made\r\nthe Duke of Parma urge upon his king, before sending the Spanish Great\r\nArmada, to seize Flushing on the coast of Holland,--advice which, had\r\nit been followed, would have made unnecessary that dreary and\r\ndisastrous voyage to the north of England. The same reasons would\r\ndoubtless lead any nation intending serious operations against our\r\nseaboard, to seize points remote from the great centres and\r\nsusceptible of defence, like Gardiner's Bay or Port Royal, which in an\r\ninefficient condition of our navy they might hold with and for their\r\nfleets.\r\n\r\nRooke retired in peace to Lisbon, bestowing by the way on Gibraltar\r\nall the victuals and ammunition that could be spared from the fleet.\r\nToulouse, instead of following up his victory, if it was one, went\r\nback to Toulon, sending only ten ships-of-the-line to support the\r\nattack on Gibraltar. All the attempts of the French against the place\r\nwere carried on in a futile manner; the investing squadron was finally\r\ndestroyed and the land attack converted into a blockade. \"With this\r\nreverse,\" says a French naval officer, \"began in the French people a\r\nregrettable reaction against the navy. The wonders to which it had\r\ngiven birth, its immense services, were forgotten. Its value was no\r\nlonger believed. The army, more directly in contact with the nation,\r\nhad all its favor, all its sympathy. The prevailing error, that the\r\ngreatness or decay of France depended upon some Rhenish positions,\r\ncould not but favor these ideas adverse to the sea service, which have\r\nmade England's strength and our weakness.\"[76]\r\n\r\nDuring this year, 1704, the battle of Blenheim was fought, in which\r\nthe French and Bavarian troops were wholly overthrown by the English\r\nand German under Marlborough and Prince Eugene. The result of this\r\nbattle was that Bavaria forsook the French alliance, and Germany\r\nbecame a secondary theatre of the general war, which was waged\r\nthereafter mainly in the Netherlands, Italy, and the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1705, the allies moved against Philip V. by two\r\nroads,--from Lisbon upon Madrid, and by way of Barcelona. The former\r\nattack, though based upon the sea, was mainly by land, and resultless;\r\nthe Spanish people in that quarter showed unmistakably that they would\r\nnot welcome the king set up by foreign powers. It was different in\r\nCatalonia. Carlos III. went there in person with the allied fleet. The\r\nFrench navy, inferior in numbers, kept in port. The French army also\r\ndid not appear. The allied troops invested the town, aided by three\r\nthousand seamen and supported by supplies landed from the fleet, which\r\nwas to them both base of supplies and line of communications.\r\nBarcelona surrendered on the 9th of October; all Catalonia welcomed\r\nCarlos, and the movement spread to Aragon and Valencia, the capital of\r\nthe latter province declaring for Carlos.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1706, the French took the offensive in Spain on\r\nthe borders of Catalonia, while defending the passes of the mountains\r\ntoward Portugal. In the absence of the allied fleet, and of the\r\nsuccors which it brought and maintained, the resistance was weak, and\r\nBarcelona was again besieged, this time by the French party supported\r\nby a French fleet of thirty sail-of-the-line and numerous transports\r\nwith supplies from the neighboring port of Toulon. The siege, begun\r\nApril 5, was going on hopefully; the Austrian claimant himself was\r\nwithin the walls, the prize of success; but on the 10th of May the\r\nallied fleet appeared, the French ships retired, and the siege was\r\nraised in disorder. The Bourbon claimant dared not retreat into\r\nAragon, and so passed by Roussillon into France, leaving his rival in\r\npossession. At the same time there moved forward from Portugal--that\r\nother base which the sea power of the English and Dutch at once\r\ncontrolled and utilized--another army maintained by the subsidies\r\nearned from the ocean. This time the western attack was more\r\nsuccessful; many cities in Estremadura and Leon fell, and as soon as\r\nthe allied generals learned the raising of the siege of Barcelona,\r\nthey pressed on by way of Salamanca to Madrid. Philip V., after\r\nescaping into France, had returned to Spain by the western Pyrenees;\r\nbut on the approach of the allies he had again to fly, leaving to them\r\nhis capital. The Portuguese and allied troops entered Madrid, June 26,\r\n1706. The allied fleet, after the fall of Barcelona, seized Alicante\r\nand Cartagena.\r\n\r\nSo far success had gone; but the inclinations of the Spanish people\r\nhad been mistaken, and the strength of their purpose and pride,\r\nsupported by the natural features of their country, was not yet\r\nunderstood. The national hatred to the Portuguese was aroused, as well\r\nas the religious dislike to heretics, the English general himself\r\nbeing a Huguenot refugee. Madrid and the surrounding country were\r\ndisaffected, and the south sent the Bourbon king assurance of its\r\nfidelity. The allies were not able to remain in the hostile capital,\r\nparticularly as the region around was empty of supplies and full of\r\nguerillas. They retired to the eastward, drawing toward the Austrian\r\nclaimant in Aragon. Reverse followed reverse, and on the 25th of\r\nApril, 1707, the allied army was disastrously overthrown at Almansa,\r\nlosing fifteen thousand men. All Spain fell back again into the power\r\nof Philip V., except the province of Catalonia, part of which also was\r\nsubdued. The next year, 1708, the French made some progress in the\r\nsame quarter, but were not able to attack Barcelona; Valencia and\r\nAlicante, however, were reduced.\r\n\r\nThe year 1707 was not marked by any naval event of importance. During\r\nthe summer the allied fleets in the Mediterranean were diverted from\r\nthe coast of Spain to support an attack upon Toulon made by the\r\nAustrians and Piedmontese. The latter moved from Italy along the coast\r\nof the Mediterranean, the fleet supporting the flank on the sea, and\r\ncontributing supplies. The siege, however, failed, and the campaign\r\nwas inconclusive. Returning home, the admiral, Sir Cloudesley Shovel,\r\nwith several ships-of-the-line, was lost on the Scilly Islands, in one\r\nof those shipwrecks which have become historical.\r\n\r\nIn 1708 the allied fleets seized Sardinia, which from its fruitfulness\r\nand nearness to Barcelona became a rich storehouse to the Austrian\r\nclaimant, so long as by the allied help he controlled the sea. The\r\nsame year Minorca, with its valuable harbor, Port Mahon, was also\r\ntaken, and from that time for fifty years remained in English hands.\r\nBlocking Cadiz and Cartagena by the possession of Gibraltar, and\r\nfacing Toulon with Port Mahon, Great Britain was now as strongly based\r\nin the Mediterranean as either France or Spain; while, with Portugal\r\nas an ally, she controlled the two stations of Lisbon and Gibraltar,\r\nwatching the trade routes both of the ocean and of the inland sea. By\r\nthe end of 1708 the disasters of France by land and sea, the frightful\r\nsufferings of the kingdom, and the almost hopelessness of carrying on\r\na strife which was destroying France, and easily borne by England, led\r\nLouis XIV. to offer most humiliating concessions to obtain peace. He\r\nundertook to surrender the whole Spanish monarchy, reserving only\r\nNaples for the Bourbon king. The allies refused; they demanded the\r\nabandonment of the whole Spanish Empire without exception by the Duke\r\nof Anjou, refusing to call him king, and added thereto ruinous\r\nconditions for France herself. Louis would not yield these, and the\r\nwar went on.\r\n\r\nDuring the remaining years the strenuous action of the sea power of\r\nthe allies, which had by this time come to be that of Great Britain\r\nalone, with little help from Holland, was less than ever obtrusive,\r\nbut the reality of its effect remained. The Austrian claimant,\r\nconfined to Catalonia for the most part, was kept in communication\r\nwith Sardinia and the Italian provinces of Germany by the English\r\nfleet; but the entire disappearance of the French navy and the evident\r\nintention on the part of Louis to keep no squadrons at sea, allowed\r\nsome diminution of the Mediterranean fleet, with the result of greater\r\nprotection to trade. In the years 1710 and 1711 expeditions were also\r\nmade against the French colonies in North America. Nova Scotia was\r\ntaken, but an attempt on Quebec failed.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1709 and 1710 Louis withdrew all the French\r\ntroops from Spain, thus abandoning the cause of his grandson. But when\r\nthe cause of France was at the very lowest, and it seemed as though\r\nshe might be driven to concessions which would reduce her to a\r\nsecond-class power, the existence of the coalition was threatened by\r\nthe disgrace of Marlborough, who represented England in it. His loss\r\nof favor with the queen was followed by the accession to power of the\r\nparty opposed to the war, or rather to its further continuance. This\r\nchange took place in the summer of 1710, and the inclination toward\r\npeace was strengthened both by the favorable position in which England\r\nthen stood for treating, and by the heavy burden she was bearing;\r\nwhich it became evident could bring in no further advantages\r\ncommensurate to its weight. The weaker ally, Holland, had gradually\r\nceased to contribute her stipulated share to the sea forces; and\r\nalthough far-sighted Englishmen might see with complacency the\r\ndisappearance of a rival sea power, the immediate increase of expense\r\nwas more looked to and felt by the men of the day. The cost both of\r\nthe continental and Spanish wars was also largely defrayed by\r\nEngland's subsidies; and while that on the continent could bring her\r\nno further gain, it was seen that the sympathies of the Spanish people\r\ncould not be overborne in favor of Carlos III. without paying more\r\nthan the game was worth. Secret negotiations between England and\r\nFrance soon began, and received an additional impulse by the\r\nunexpected death of the Emperor of Germany, the brother of the\r\nAustrian claimant of the Spanish throne. There being no other male\r\nheir, Carlos became at once emperor of Austria, and was soon after\r\nelected emperor of Germany. England had no more wish to see two crowns\r\non an Austrian head than on that of a Bourbon.\r\n\r\nThe demands made by England, as conditions of peace in 1711, showed\r\nher to have become a sea power in the purest sense of the word, not\r\nonly in fact, but also in her own consciousness. She required that the\r\nsame person should never be king both of France and Spain; that a\r\nbarrier of fortified towns should be granted her allies, Holland and\r\nGermany, as a defensive line against France; that French conquests\r\nfrom her allies should be restored; and for herself she demanded the\r\nformal cession of Gibraltar and Port Mahon, whose strategic and\r\nmaritime value has been pointed out, the destruction of the port of\r\nDunkirk, the home nest of the privateers that preyed on English\r\ncommerce, the cession of the French colonies of Newfoundland, Hudson's\r\nBay, and Nova Scotia, the last of which she held at that time, and\r\nfinally, treaties of commerce with France and Spain, and the\r\nconcession of the monopoly of the slave trade with Spanish America,\r\nknown as the Asiento, which Spain had given to France in 1701.\r\n\r\nNegotiations continued, though hostilities did not cease; and in June,\r\n1712, a four months' truce between Great Britain and France removed\r\nthe English troops from the allied armies on the continent, their\r\ngreat leader Marlborough having been taken from their head the year\r\nbefore. The campaign of 1712 was favorable to France; but in almost\r\nany event the withdrawal of Great Britain made the end of the war a\r\nquestion of but a short time. The remonstrances of Holland were met by\r\nthe reply that since 1707 the Dutch had not furnished more than one\r\nthird their quota of ships, and taking the war through, not over one\r\nhalf. The House of Commons in an address to the throne in 1712\r\ncomplained that--\r\n\r\n    \"The service at sea hath been carried on through the whole\r\n    course of the war in a manner highly disadvantageous to your\r\n    Majesty's kingdom, for the necessity requiring that great fleets\r\n    should be fitted out every year for maintaining a superiority\r\n    in the Mediterranean and for opposing any force which the enemy\r\n    might prepare either at Dunkirk or in the ports of west France;\r\n    your Majesty's readiness, in fitting out your proportion of\r\n    ships for all parts of that service, hath not prevailed with\r\n    Holland, which has been greatly deficient every year in\r\n    proportion to what your Majesty hath furnished.... Hence your\r\n    Majesty hath been obliged to supply those deficiencies with\r\n    additional reinforcements of your own ships, and your Majesty's\r\n    ships have been forced in greater numbers to continue in remote\r\n    seas, and at unseasonable times of the year, to the great damage\r\n    of the navy. This also hath straitened the convoys for trade;\r\n    the coasts have been exposed for want of cruisers; and you have\r\n    been disabled from annoying the enemy in their most beneficial\r\n    commerce with the West Indies, whence they received those vast\r\n    supplies of treasure, without which they could not have\r\n    supported the expenses of the war.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, between 1701 and 1716 the commerce of Spanish America had\r\nbrought into France forty million dollars in specie. To these\r\ncomplaints the Dutch envoy to England could only reply that Holland\r\nwas not in a condition to fulfil her compacts. The reverses of 1712,\r\nadded to Great Britain's fixed purpose to have peace, decided the\r\nDutch to the same; and the English still kept, amid their\r\ndissatisfaction with their allies, so much of their old feeling\r\nagainst France as to support all the reasonable claims of Holland.\r\nApril 11, 1713, an almost general peace, known as the Peace of\r\nUtrecht, one of the landmarks of history, was signed between France on\r\nthe one hand, and England, Holland, Prussia, Portugal, and Savoy on\r\nthe other. The emperor still held out, but the loss of British\r\nsubsidies fettered the movements of his armies, and with the\r\nwithdrawal of the sea powers the continental war might have fallen of\r\nitself; but France with her hands freed carried on during 1713 a\r\nbrilliant and successful campaign in Germany. On the 7th of March,\r\n1714, peace was signed between France and Austria. Some embers of the\r\nwar continued to burn in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, which\r\npersisted in their rebellion against Philip V.; but the revolt was\r\nstifled as soon as the arms of France were turned against them.\r\nBarcelona was taken by storm in September, 1714; the islands submitted\r\nin the following summer.\r\n\r\nThe changes effected by this long war and sanctioned by the peace,\r\nneglecting details of lesser or passing importance, may be stated as\r\nfollows: 1. The House of Bourbon was settled on the Spanish throne,\r\nand the Spanish empire retained its West Indian and American\r\npossessions; the purpose of William III. against her dominion there\r\nwas frustrated when England undertook to support the Austrian prince,\r\nand so fastened the greater part of her naval force to the\r\nMediterranean. 2. The Spanish empire lost its possessions in the\r\nNetherlands, Gelderland going to the new kingdom of Prussia and\r\nBelgium to the emperor; the Spanish Netherlands thus became the\r\nAustrian Netherlands. 3. Spain lost also the principal islands of the\r\nMediterranean; Sardinia being given to Austria, Minorca with its fine\r\nharbor to Great Britain, and Sicily to the Duke of Savoy. 4. Spain\r\nlost also her Italian possessions, Milan and Naples going to the\r\nemperor. Such, in the main, were the results to Spain of the fight\r\nover the succession to her throne.\r\n\r\nFrance, the backer of the successful claimant, came out of the strife\r\nworn out, and with considerable loss of territory. She had succeeded\r\nin placing a king of her own royal house on a neighboring throne, but\r\nher sea strength was exhausted, her population diminished, her\r\nfinancial condition ruined. The European territory surrendered was on\r\nher northern and eastern boundaries; and she abandoned the use of the\r\nport of Dunkirk, the centre of that privateering warfare so dreaded by\r\nEnglish merchants. In America, the cession of Nova Scotia and\r\nNewfoundland was the first step toward that entire loss of Canada\r\nwhich befell half a century later; but for the present she retained\r\nCape Breton Island, with its port Louisburg, the key to the Gulf and\r\nRiver St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThe gains of England, by the treaty and the war, corresponded very\r\nnearly to the losses of France and Spain, and were all in the\r\ndirection of extending and strengthening her sea power. Gibraltar and\r\nPort Mahon in the Mediterranean, and the colonies already mentioned in\r\nNorth America, afforded new bases to that power, extending and\r\nprotecting her trade. Second only to the expansion of her own was the\r\ninjury to the sea power of France and Holland, by the decay of their\r\nnavies in consequence of the immense drain of the land warfare;\r\nfurther indications of that decay will be given later. The very\r\nneglect of Holland to fill up her quota of ships, and the bad\r\ncondition of those sent, while imposing extra burdens upon England,\r\nmay be considered a benefit, forcing the British navy to greater\r\ndevelopment and effort. The disproportion in military power on the sea\r\nwas further increased by the destruction of the works at Dunkirk; for\r\nthough not in itself a first-class port, nor of much depth of water,\r\nit had great artificial military strength, and its position was\r\npeculiarly adapted to annoy English trade. It was but forty miles from\r\nthe South Foreland and the Downs, and the Channel abreast it is but\r\ntwenty miles wide. Dunkirk was one of Louis' earliest acquisitions,\r\nand in its development was as his own child; the dismantling of the\r\nworks and filling-in of the port show the depth of his humiliation at\r\nthis time. But it was the wisdom of England not to base her sea power\r\nsolely on military positions nor even on fighting-ships, and the\r\ncommercial advantages she had now gained by the war and the peace were\r\nvery great. The grant of the slave trade with Spanish America, in\r\nitself lucrative, became yet more so as the basis for an immense\r\nsmuggling intercourse with those countries, which gave the English a\r\npartial recompense for their failure to obtain actual possession;\r\nwhile the cessions made to Portugal by France in South America were\r\nmainly to the advantage of England, which had obtained the control of\r\nPortuguese trade by the treaty of 1703. The North American colonies\r\nceded were valuable, not merely nor chiefly as military stations, but\r\ncommercially; and treaties of commerce on favorable terms were made\r\nboth with France and Spain. A minister of the day, defending the\r\ntreaty in Parliament, said: \"The advantages from this peace appear in\r\nthe addition made to our wealth; in the great quantities of bullion\r\nlately coined in our mint; by the vast increase in our shipping\r\nemployed since the peace, in the fisheries, and in merchandise; and by\r\nthe remarkable growth of the customs upon imports, and of our\r\nmanufactures, and the growth of our country upon export;\" in a word,\r\nby the impetus to trade in all its branches.\r\n\r\nWhile England thus came out from the war in good running condition,\r\nand fairly placed in that position of maritime supremacy which she has\r\nso long maintained, her old rival in trade and fighting was left\r\nhopelessly behind. As the result of the war Holland obtained nothing\r\nat sea,--no colony, no station. The commercial treaty with France\r\nplaced her on the same terms as England, but she received no\r\nconcessions giving her a footing in Spanish America like that obtained\r\nby her ally. Indeed, some years before the peace, while the coalition\r\nwas still maintaining Carlos, a treaty was made with the latter by the\r\nBritish minister, unknown to the Dutch, practically giving the British\r\nmonopoly of Spanish trade in America; sharing it only with Spaniards,\r\nwhich was pretty much the same as not sharing it at all. This treaty\r\naccidentally became known, and made a great impression on the Dutch;\r\nbut England was then so necessary to the coalition that she ran no\r\nrisk of being left out by its other members. The gain which Holland\r\nmade by land was that of military occupation only, of certain\r\nfortified places in the Austrian Netherlands, known to history as the\r\n\"barrier towns;\" nothing was added by them to her revenue, population,\r\nor resources; nothing to that national strength which must underlie\r\nmilitary institutions. Holland had forsaken, perhaps unavoidably, the\r\npath by which she had advanced to wealth and to leadership among\r\nnations. The exigencies of her continental position had led to the\r\nneglect of her navy, which in those days of war and privateering\r\ninvolved a loss of carrying-trade and commerce: and although she held\r\nher head high through the war, the symptoms of weakness were apparent\r\nin her failing armaments. Therefore, though the United Provinces\r\nattained the great object for which they began the war, and saved the\r\nSpanish Netherlands from the hands of France, the success was not\r\nworth the cost. Thenceforth they withdrew for a long period from the\r\nwars and diplomacy of Europe; partly, perhaps, because they saw how\r\nlittle they had gained, but yet more from actual weakness and\r\ninability. After the strenuous exertions of the war came a reaction,\r\nwhich showed painfully the inherent weakness of a State narrow in\r\nterritory and small in the number of its people. The visible decline\r\nof the Provinces dates from the Peace of Utrecht; the real decline\r\nbegan earlier. Holland ceased to be numbered among the great powers of\r\nEurope, her navy was no longer a military factor in diplomacy, and her\r\ncommerce also shared in the general decline of the State.\r\n\r\nIt remains only to notice briefly the results to Austria, and to\r\nGermany generally. France yielded the barrier of the Rhine, with\r\nfortified places on the east bank of the river. Austria received, as\r\nhas been mentioned, Belgium, Sardinia, Naples, and the Spanish\r\npossessions in northern Italy; dissatisfied in other respects, Austria\r\nwas especially discontented at her failure to obtain Sicily, and did\r\nnot cease negotiating afterward, until she had secured that island. A\r\ncircumstance more important to Germany and to all Europe than this\r\ntransitory acquisition of distant and alien countries by Austria was\r\nthe rise of Prussia, which dates from this war as a Protestant and\r\nmilitary kingdom destined to weigh in the balance against Austria.\r\n\r\nSuch were the leading results of the War of the Spanish Succession,\r\n\"the vastest yet witnessed by Europe since the Crusades.\" It was a war\r\nwhose chief military interest was on the land,--a war in which fought\r\ntwo of the greatest generals of all times, Marlborough and Prince\r\nEugene, the names of whose battles, Blenheim, Ramillies, Malplaquet,\r\nTurin, are familiar to the most casual reader of history; while a\r\nmultitude of able men distinguished themselves on the other theatres\r\nof the strife, in Flanders, in Germany, in Italy, in Spain. On the\r\nsea only one great battle, and that scarcely worthy of the name, took\r\nplace. Yet looking only, for the moment, to immediate and evident\r\nresults, who reaped the benefit? Was it France, whose only gain was to\r\nseat a Bourbon on the Spanish throne? Was it Spain, whose only gain\r\nwas to have a Bourbon king instead of an Austrian, and thus a closer\r\nalliance with France? Was it Holland, with its barrier of fortified\r\ntowns, its ruined navy, and its exhausted people? Was it, lastly,\r\nAustria, even though she had fought with the money of the sea powers,\r\nand gained such maritime States as the Netherlands and Naples? Was it\r\nwith these, who had waged war more and more exclusively by land, and\r\nset their eyes more and more on gains on the land, or was it not\r\nrather with England, who had indeed paid for that continental war and\r\neven backed it with her troops, but who meanwhile was building up her\r\nnavy, strengthening, extending, and protecting her commerce, seizing\r\nmaritime positions,--in a word, founding and rearing her sea power\r\nupon the ruins of that of her rivals, friend and foe alike? It is not\r\nto depreciate the gains of others that the eye fixes on England's\r\nnaval growth; their gains but bring out more clearly the immenseness\r\nof hers. It was a gain to France to have a friend rather than an enemy\r\nin her rear, though her navy and shipping were ruined. It was a gain\r\nto Spain to be brought in close intercourse with a living country like\r\nFrance after a century of political death, and she had saved the\r\ngreater part of her threatened possessions. It was a gain to Holland\r\nto be definitively freed from French aggression, with Belgium in the\r\nhands of a strong instead of a weak State. And it doubtless was a gain\r\nto Austria not only to have checked, chiefly at the expense of others,\r\nthe progress of her hereditary enemy, but also to have received\r\nprovinces like Sicily and Naples, which, under wise government, might\r\nbecome the foundation of a respectable sea power. But not one of these\r\ngains, nor all together, compared in greatness, and much less in\r\nsolidity, with the gain to England of that unequalled sea power which\r\nstarted ahead during the War of the League of Augsburg, and received\r\nits completeness and seal during that of the Spanish Succession. By it\r\nshe controlled the great commerce of the open sea with a military\r\nshipping that had no rival, and in the exhausted condition of the\r\nother nations could have none; and that shipping was now securely\r\nbased on strong positions in all the disputed quarters of the world.\r\nAlthough her Indian empire was not yet begun, the vast superiority of\r\nher navy would enable her to control the communications of other\r\nnations with those rich and distant regions, and to assert her will in\r\nany disputes arising among the trading-stations of the different\r\nnationalities. The commerce which had sustained her in prosperity, and\r\nher allies in military efficiency, during the war, though checked and\r\nharassed by the enemy's cruisers (to which she could pay only partial\r\nattention amid the many claims upon her), started with a bound into\r\nnew life when the war was over. All over the world, exhausted by their\r\nshare of the common suffering, people were longing for the return of\r\nprosperity and peaceful commerce; and there was no country ready as\r\nEngland was in wealth, capital, and shipping to forward and reap the\r\nadvantages of every enterprise by which the interchange of commodities\r\nwas promoted, either by lawful or unlawful means. In the War of the\r\nSpanish Succession, by her own wise management and through the\r\nexhaustion of other nations, not only her navy but her trade was\r\nsteadily built up; and indeed, in that dangerous condition of the\r\nseas, traversed by some of the most reckless and restless cruisers\r\nFrance ever sent out, the efficiency of the navy meant safer voyages,\r\nand so more employment for the merchant-ships. The British\r\nmerchant-ships, being better protected than those of the Dutch, gained\r\nthe reputation of being far safer carriers, and the carrying-trade\r\nnaturally passed more and more into their hands; while the habit of\r\nemploying them in preference, once established, was likely to\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n    \"Taking all things together,\" says an historian of the British\r\n    navy, \"I doubt whether the credit of the English nation ever\r\n    stood higher than at this period, or the spirit of the people\r\n    higher. The success of our arms at sea, the necessity of\r\n    protecting our trade, and the popularity of every step taken to\r\n    increase our maritime power, occasioned such measures to be\r\n    pursued as annually added to our force. Hence arose that mighty\r\n    difference which at the close of the year 1706 appeared in the\r\n    Royal Navy; this, not only in the number but in the quality of\r\n    the ships, was much superior to what it had been at the time of\r\n    the Revolution or even before. Hence it was that our trade\r\n    rather increased than diminished during the last war, and that\r\n    we gained so signally by our strict intercourse with\r\n    Portugal.\"[77]\r\n\r\nThe sea power of England therefore was not merely in the great navy,\r\nwith which we too commonly and exclusively associate it; France had\r\nhad such a navy in 1688, and it shrivelled away like a leaf in the\r\nfire. Neither was it in a prosperous commerce alone; a few years after\r\nthe date at which we have arrived, the commerce of France took on fair\r\nproportions, but the first blast of war swept it off the seas as the\r\nnavy of Cromwell had once swept that of Holland. It was in the union\r\nof the two, carefully fostered, that England made the gain of sea\r\npower over and beyond all other States; and this gain is distinctly\r\nassociated with and dates from the War of the Spanish Succession.\r\nBefore that war England was one of the sea powers; after it she was\r\n_the_ sea power, without any second. This power also she held alone,\r\nunshared by friend and unchecked by foe. She alone was rich, and in\r\nher control of the sea and her extensive shipping had the sources of\r\nwealth so much in her hands that there was no present danger of a\r\nrival on the ocean. Thus her gain of sea power and wealth was not only\r\ngreat but solid, being wholly in her own hands; while the gains of the\r\nother States were not merely inferior in degree, but weaker in kind,\r\nin that they depended more or less upon the good will of other\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nIs it meant, it may be asked, to attribute to sea power alone the\r\ngreatness or wealth of any State? Certainly not. The due use and\r\ncontrol of the sea is but one link in the chain of exchange by which\r\nwealth accumulates; but it is the central link, which lays under\r\ncontribution other nations for the benefit of the one holding it, and\r\nwhich, history seems to assert, most surely of all gathers to itself\r\nriches. In England, this control and use of the sea seems to arise\r\nnaturally, from the concurrence of many circumstances; the years\r\nimmediately preceding the War of the Spanish Succession had, moreover,\r\nfurthered the advance of her prosperity by a series of fiscal\r\nmeasures, which Macaulay speaks of as \"the deep and solid foundation\r\non which was to rise the most gigantic fabric of commercial prosperity\r\nwhich the world had ever seen.\" It may be questioned, however, whether\r\nthe genius of the people, inclined to and developed by trade, did not\r\nmake easier the taking of such measures; whether their adoption did\r\nnot at least partially spring from, as well as add to, the sea power\r\nof the nation. However that may be, there is seen, on the opposite\r\nside of the Channel, a nation which started ahead of England in the\r\nrace,--a nation peculiarly well fitted, by situation and resources,\r\nfor the control of the sea both by war and commerce. The position of\r\nFrance is in this peculiar, that of all the great powers she alone had\r\na free choice; the others were more or less constrained to the land\r\nchiefly, or to the sea chiefly, for any movement outside their own\r\nborders; but she to her long continental frontier added a seaboard on\r\nthree seas. In 1672 she definitely chose expansion by land. At that\r\ntime Colbert had administered her finances for twelve years, and from\r\na state of terrible confusion had so restored them that the revenue of\r\nthe King of France was more than double that of the King of England.\r\nIn those days France paid the subsidies of Europe; but Colbert's plans\r\nand hopes for France rested upon making her powerful on the sea. The\r\nwar with Holland arrested these plans, the onward movement of\r\nprosperity ceased, the nation was thrown back upon itself, shut off\r\nfrom the outside world. Many causes doubtless worked together to the\r\ndisastrous result which marked the end of the reign of Louis XIV.:\r\nconstant wars, bad administration in the latter half of the period,\r\nextravagance throughout; but France was practically never invaded, the\r\nwar was kept at or beyond her own frontiers with slight exceptions,\r\nher home industries could suffer little from direct hostilities. In\r\nthese respects she was nearly equal to England, and under better\r\nconditions than her other enemies. What made the difference in the\r\nresults? Why was France miserable and exhausted, while England was\r\nsmiling and prosperous? Why did England dictate, and France accept,\r\nterms of peace? The reason apparently was the difference in wealth and\r\ncredit. France stood alone against many enemies; but those enemies\r\nwere raised and kept moving by English subsidies. The Lord Treasurer\r\nof England, writing in 1706 to Marlborough, says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Though the land and trade of both England and Holland have\r\n    excessive burthens upon them, yet the credit continues good both\r\n    of them and us; whereas the finances of France are so much more\r\n    exhausted that they are forced to give twenty and twenty-five\r\n    per cent for every penny they send out of the kingdom, unless\r\n    they send it in specie.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1712 the expenditure of France was 240,000,000 francs, while the\r\ntaxes brought in only 113,000,000 gross, of which, after deducting\r\nlosses and necessary expenses, only 37,000,000 remained in the\r\ntreasury; the deficit was sought to be met by anticipating parts of\r\nthe revenue for years ahead, and by a series of extraordinary\r\ntransactions tedious to name or to understand.\r\n\r\n    \"In the summer of 1715 [two years after the peace] it seemed as\r\n    if the situation could not grow worse,--no more public nor\r\n    private credit; no more clear revenue for the State; the\r\n    portions of the revenue not pledged, anticipated on the\r\n    following years. Neither labor nor consumption could be resumed\r\n    for want of circulation; usury reigned on the ruins of society.\r\n    The alternations of high prices and the depreciation of\r\n    commodities finally crushed the people. Provision riots broke\r\n    out among them, and even in the army. Manufactures were\r\n    languishing or suspended; forced mendicity was preying upon the\r\n    cities. The fields were deserted, the lands fallow for lack of\r\n    instruments, for lack of manure, for lack of cattle; the houses\r\n    were falling to ruin. Monarchical France seemed ready to expire\r\n    with its aged king.\"[78]\r\n\r\nThus it was in France, with a population of nineteen millions at that\r\ntime to the eight millions of all the British Islands; with a land\r\nvastly more fertile and productive; before the great days, too, of\r\ncoal and iron. \"In England, on the contrary, the immense grants of\r\nParliament in 1710 struck the French prodigiously; for while their\r\ncredit was low, or in a manner quite gone, ours was at its zenith.\"\r\nDuring that same war \"there appeared that mighty spirit among our\r\nmerchants which enabled them to carry on all their schemes with a\r\nvigor that kept a constant circulation of money throughout the\r\nkingdom, and afforded such mighty encouragement to all manufactures as\r\nhas made the remembrance of those times grateful in worse.\"\r\n\r\n    \"By the treaty with Portugal we were prodigious gainers.... The\r\n    Portuguese began to feel the comfortable effects of their Brazil\r\n    gold mines, and the prodigious commerce that followed with us\r\n    made their good fortune in great measure ours; and so it has\r\n    been ever since; otherwise I know not how the expenses of the\r\n    war had been borne.... The running cash in the kingdom increased\r\n    very considerably, which must be attributed in great measure to\r\n    our Portuguese trade; and this, as I have made manifest, we owed\r\n    wholly to our power at sea [which took Portugal from the\r\n    alliance of the two crowns, and threw her upon the protection of\r\n    the maritime powers]. Our trade with the Spanish West Indies by\r\n    way of Cadiz was certainly much interrupted at the beginning of\r\n    this war; but afterward it was in great measure restored, as\r\n    well by direct communication with several provinces when under\r\n    the Archduke, as through Portugal, by which a very great though\r\n    contraband trade was carried on. We were at the same time very\r\n    great gainers by our commerce with the Spaniards in the West\r\n    Indies [also contraband].... Our colonies, though complaining of\r\n    neglect, grew richer, more populous, and carried their trade\r\n    farther than in former times.... Our national end with respect\r\n    to England was in this war particularly in great measure\r\n    answered,--I mean the destruction of the French power at sea,\r\n    for, after the battle of Malaga, we hear no more of their great\r\n    fleets; and though by this the number of their privateers was\r\n    very much increased, yet the losses of our merchants were far\r\n    less in the latter than in the former reign.... It is certainly\r\n    a matter of great satisfaction that ... setting out at first\r\n    with the sight of so great a naval power as the French king had\r\n    assembled in 1688, while we struggled under such difficulties,\r\n    and when we got out of that troublesome war, in 1697, found\r\n    ourselves loaded with a debt too heavy to be shaken off in the\r\n    short interval of peace, yet by 1706, instead of seeing the navy\r\n    of France riding upon our coast, we sent every year a powerful\r\n    fleet to insult theirs, superior to them not only in the ocean,\r\n    but in the Mediterranean, forcing them entirely out of that sea\r\n    by the mere sight of our flag.... By this we not only secured\r\n    our trade with the Levant, and strengthened our interests with\r\n    all the Italian princes, but struck the States of Barbary with\r\n    terror, and awed the Sultan from listening to any proposals from\r\n    France. Such were the fruits of the increase of our naval power,\r\n    and of the manner in which it was employed.... Such fleets were\r\n    necessary; they at once protected our flag and our allies, and\r\n    attached them to our interest; and, what is of greater\r\n    importance than all the rest, they established our reputation\r\n    for maritime force so effectually that we feel even to this day\r\n    [1740] the happy effects of the fame thus acquired.\"[79]\r\n\r\nIt is needless to add more. Thus stood the Power of the Seas during\r\nthe years in which the French historians tell us that their cruisers\r\nwere battening on her commerce. The English writer admits heavy\r\nlosses. In 1707, that is, in the space of five years, the returns,\r\naccording to the report of a committee of the House of Lords, \"show\r\nthat since the beginning of the war England had lost 30 ships-of-war\r\nand 1146 merchant-ships, of which 300 were retaken; whereas we had\r\ntaken from them, or destroyed, 80 ships-of-war, and 1346 merchantmen;\r\n175 privateers also were taken.\" The greater number of the\r\nships-of-war were probably on private venture, as has been explained.\r\nBut, be the relative numbers what they may, no argument is needed\r\nbeyond the statements just given, to show the inability of a mere\r\ncruising warfare, not based upon large fleets, to break down a great\r\nsea power. Jean Bart died in 1702; but in Forbin, Du Casse, and\r\nothers, and above all in Duguay-Trouin, he left worthy successors, the\r\nequals of any commerce-destroyers the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe name of Duguay-Trouin suggests the mention, before finally leaving\r\nthe War of the Spanish Succession, of his greatest privateering\r\nexpedition, carried to a distance from home rarely reached by the\r\nseamen of his occupation, and which illustrates curiously the spirit of\r\nsuch enterprises in that day, and the shifts to which the French\r\ngovernment was reduced. A small French squadron had attacked Rio\r\nJaneiro in 1710, but being repulsed, had lost some prisoners, who were\r\nsaid to have been put to death. Duguay-Trouin sought permission to\r\navenge the insult to France. The king, consenting, advanced the ships\r\nand furnished the crews; and a regular contract was drawn up between\r\nthe king on the one hand and the company employing Duguay-Trouin on the\r\nother, stipulating the expenses to be borne and supplies furnished on\r\neither hand; among which we find the odd, business-like provision that\r\nfor every one of the troops embarked who shall die, be killed, or\r\ndesert during the cruise, the company should pay a forfeit of thirty\r\nfrancs. The king was to receive one fifth of the net profits, and was\r\nto bear the loss of any one of the vessels that should be wrecked, or\r\ndestroyed in action. Under these provisions, enumerated in full in a\r\nlong contract, Duguay-Trouin received a force of six ships-of-the-line,\r\nseven frigates, and over two thousand troops, with which he sailed to\r\nRio Janeiro in 1711; captured the place after a series of operations,\r\nand allowed it to be ransomed at the price of something under four\r\nhundred thousand dollars, probably nearly equal to a million in the\r\npresent day, besides five hundred cases of sugar. The privateering\r\ncompany cleared about ninety-two per cent on their venture. As two of\r\nthe ships-of-the-line were never heard from after sailing on the\r\nreturn voyage, the king's profits were probably small.\r\n\r\nWhile the War of the Spanish Succession was engaging all western\r\nEurope, a strife which might have had a profound influence upon its\r\nissue was going on in the east. Sweden and Russia were at war, the\r\nHungarians had revolted against Austria, and Turkey was finally drawn\r\nin, though not till the end of the year 1710. Had Turkey helped the\r\nHungarians, she would have made a powerful diversion, not for the\r\nfirst time in history, in favor of France. The English historian\r\nsuggests that she was deterred by fear of the English fleet; at all\r\nevents she did not move, and Hungary was reduced to obedience. The war\r\nbetween Sweden and Russia was to result in the preponderance of the\r\nlatter upon the Baltic, the subsidence of Sweden, the old ally of\r\nFrance, into a second-rate State, and the entrance of Russia\r\ndefinitively into European politics.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[75] Martin: History of France.\r\n\r\n[76] Lapeyrouse-Bonfils: Hist. de la Marine Française.\r\n\r\n[77] Campbell: Lives of the Admirals.\r\n\r\n[78] Martin: History of France.\r\n\r\n[79] Campbell: Lives of the Admirals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    THE REGENCY IN FRANCE.--ALBERONI IN SPAIN.--POLICIES OF WALPOLE\r\n    AND FLEURI.--WAR OF THE POLISH SUCCESSION.--ENGLISH CONTRABAND\r\n    TRADE IN SPANISH AMERICA.--GREAT BRITAIN DECLARES WAR AGAINST\r\n    SPAIN.--1715-1739.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Utrecht was soon followed by the deaths of the rulers of\r\nthe two countries which had played the foremost part in the War of the\r\nSpanish Succession. Queen Anne died August 1, 1714; Louis XIV. on the\r\n1st of September, 1715.\r\n\r\nThe successor to the English throne, the German George I., though\r\nundoubtedly the choice of the English people, was far from being their\r\nfavorite, and was rather endured as a necessary evil, giving them a\r\nProtestant instead of a Roman Catholic king. Along with the coldness\r\nand dislike of his own partisans, he found a very considerable body of\r\ndisaffected men, who wished to see the son of James II. on the throne.\r\nThere was therefore a lack of solidity, more apparent than real, but\r\nstill real, in his position. In France, on the contrary, the\r\nsuccession to the throne was undisputed; but the heir was a child of\r\nfive years, and there was much jealousy as to the possession of the\r\nregency, a power more absolute than that of the King of England. The\r\nregency was obtained and exercised by the next in succession to the\r\nthrone, Philip, Duke of Orleans; but he had to apprehend, not only\r\nattempts on the part of rivals in France to shake his hold, but also\r\nthe active enmity of the Bourbon king of Spain, Philip V.,--an enmity\r\nwhich seems to have dated from an intrigue of Orleans, during the late\r\nwar, to supplant Philip on the Spanish throne. There was therefore a\r\nfeeling of instability, of apprehension, in the governments of England\r\nand France, which influenced the policy of both. As regards the\r\nrelations of France and Spain, the mutual hatred of the actual rulers\r\nstood for a while in the way of the friendly accord Louis XIV. had\r\nhoped from family ties, and was injurious to the true interests of\r\nboth nations.\r\n\r\nThe Regent Orleans, under the advice of the most able and celebrated\r\nFrench statesman of that day, the Abbé Dubois, made overtures of\r\nalliance to the King of Great Britain. He began first by commercial\r\nconcessions of the kind generally acceptable to the English,\r\nforbidding French shipping to trade to the South Seas under penalty of\r\ndeath, and lowering the duties on the importation of English coal.\r\nEngland at first received these advances warily; but the regent would\r\nnot be discouraged, and offered, further, to compel the Pretender,\r\nJames III., to withdraw beyond the Alps. He also undertook to fill up\r\nthe port at Mardyck, a new excavation by which the French government\r\nwas trying to indemnify itself for the loss of Dunkirk. These\r\nconcessions, all of which but one, it will be noted, were at the\r\nexpense of the sea power or commercial interests of France, induced\r\nEngland to sign a treaty by which the two countries mutually\r\nguaranteed the execution of the treaties of Utrecht as far as their\r\nrespective interests were concerned; especially the clause by which\r\nthe House of Orleans was to succeed to the French throne, if Louis XV.\r\ndied childless. The Protestant succession in England was likewise\r\nguaranteed. Holland, exhausted by the war, was unwilling to enter upon\r\nnew engagements, but was at last brought over to this by the remission\r\nof certain dues on her merchandise entering France. The treaty, signed\r\nin January, 1717, was known as the Triple Alliance, and bound France\r\nto England for some years to come.\r\n\r\nWhile France was thus making overtures to England, Spain, under the\r\nguidance of another able churchman, was seeking the same alliance and\r\nat the same time developing her national strength with the hope of\r\nrecovering her lost Italian States. The new minister, Cardinal\r\nAlberoni, promised Philip V. to put him in a position to reconquer\r\nSicily and Naples, if granted five years of peace. He worked hard to\r\nbring up the revenues, rebuild the navy, and re-establish the army,\r\nwhile at the same time promoting manufactures, commerce, and shipping,\r\nand the advance made in all these was remarkable; but the more\r\nlegitimate ambition of Spain to recover her lost possessions, and with\r\nthem to establish her power in the Mediterranean, so grievously\r\nwounded by the loss of Gibraltar, was hampered by the ill-timed\r\npurpose of Philip to overthrow the regency of Orleans in France.\r\nAlberoni was compelled to alienate France, whose sea power, as well as\r\nthat of Spain, was concerned in seeing Sicily in friendly hands, and,\r\ninstead of that natural ally, had to conciliate the maritime powers,\r\nEngland and Holland. This he also sought to do by commercial\r\nconcessions; promising promptly to put the English in possession of\r\nthe privileges granted at Utrecht, concerning which Spain had so far\r\ndelayed. In return, he asked favorable action from them in Italy.\r\nGeorge I., who was at heart German, received coldly advances which\r\nwere unfriendly to the German emperor in his Italian dominions; and\r\nAlberoni, offended, withdrew them. The Triple Alliance, by\r\nguaranteeing the existing arrangement of succession to the French\r\nthrone, gave further offence to Philip V., who dreamed of asserting\r\nhis own claim. The result of all these negotiations was to bind\r\nEngland and France together against Spain,--a blind policy for the two\r\nBourbon kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThe gist of the situation created by these different aims and\r\nfeelings, was that the Emperor of Austria and the King of Spain both\r\nwanted Sicily, which at Utrecht had been given to the Duke of Savoy;\r\nand that France and England both wished for peace in western Europe,\r\nbecause war would give an opportunity to the malcontents in either\r\nkingdom. The position of George, however, being more secure than that\r\nof Orleans, the policy of the latter tended to yield to that of the\r\nformer, and this tendency was increased by the active ill-will of the\r\nKing of Spain. George, as a German, wished the emperor's success; and\r\nthe English statesmen naturally preferred to see Sicily in the hands\r\nof their late ally and well-assured friend rather than in Spain's.\r\nFrance, contrary to her true policy, but under the urgency of the\r\nregent's position, entertained the same views, and it was proposed to\r\nmodify the Treaty of Utrecht by transferring Sicily from Savoy to\r\nAustria, giving the former Sardinia instead. It was necessary,\r\nhowever, to consider Spain, which under Alberoni had already gained a\r\ndegree of military power astounding to those who had known her\r\nweakness during the last war. She was not yet ready to fight, for only\r\nhalf of the five years asked by the cardinal had passed; but still\r\nless was she ready to forego her ambitions. A trifling incident\r\nprecipitated an outbreak. A high Spanish official, travelling from\r\nRome to Spain by land, and so passing through the Italian States of\r\nthe emperor, was arrested as a rebellious subject by order of the\r\nlatter, who still styled himself King of Spain. At this insult,\r\nAlberoni could not hold Philip back. An expedition of twelve ships of\r\nwar and eighty-six hundred soldiers was sent against Sardinia, the\r\ntransfer to Savoy not having yet taken effect, and reduced the island\r\nin a few months. This happened in 1717.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the Spaniards would at once have moved on against Sicily;\r\nbut France and England now intervened more actively to prevent the\r\ngeneral war that seemed threatening. England sent a fleet to the\r\nMediterranean, and negotiations began at Paris, Vienna, and Madrid.\r\nThe outcome of these conferences was an agreement between England and\r\nFrance to effect the exchange of Sardinia and Sicily just mentioned,\r\nrecompensing Spain by giving her Parma and Tuscany in northern Italy,\r\nand stipulating that the emperor should renounce forever his absurd\r\nbut irritating claim to the Spanish crown. This arrangement was to be\r\nenforced by arms, if necessary. The emperor at first refused consent;\r\nbut the increasing greatness of Alberoni's preparations at last\r\ndecided him to accept so advantageous an offer, and the accession of\r\nHolland to the compact gave it the historical title of the Quadruple\r\nAlliance. Spain was obstinate; and it is significant of Alberoni's\r\nachievements in developing her power, and the eagerness, not to say\r\nanxiety, of George I., that the offer was made to purchase her consent\r\nby ceding Gibraltar. If the Regent Orleans knew this, it would partly\r\njustify his forwarding the negotiations.\r\n\r\nAlberoni tried to back up his military power by diplomatic efforts\r\nextending all over Europe. Russia and Sweden were brought together in\r\na project for invading England in the interest of the Stuarts; the\r\nsigning of the Quadruple Alliance in Holland was delayed by his\r\nagents; a conspiracy was started in France against the regent; the\r\nTurks were stirred up against the emperor; discontent was fomented\r\nthroughout Great Britain; and an attempt was made to gain over the\r\nDuke of Savoy, outraged by being deprived of Sicily. On the 1st of\r\nJuly, 1718, a Spanish army of thirty thousand troops, escorted by\r\ntwenty-two ships-of-the-line, appeared at Palermo. The troops of Savoy\r\nevacuated the city and pretty nearly the whole island, resistance\r\nbeing concentrated in the citadel of Messina. Anxiety was felt in\r\nNaples itself, until the English admiral, Byng,[80] anchored there the\r\nday after the investment of Messina. The King of Sicily having now\r\nconsented to the terms of the Quadruple Alliance, Byng received on\r\nboard two thousand Austrian troops to be landed at Messina. When he\r\nappeared before the place, finding it besieged, he wrote to the\r\nSpanish general suggesting a suspension of arms for two months. This\r\nwas of course refused; so the Austrians were landed again at Reggio,\r\nin Italy, and Byng passed through the Straits of Messina to seek the\r\nSpanish fleet, which had gone to the southward.\r\n\r\nThe engagement which ensued can scarcely be called a battle, and, as\r\nis apt to happen in such affairs, when the parties are on the verge of\r\nwar but war has not actually been declared, there is some doubt as to\r\nhow far the attack was morally justifiable on the part of the English.\r\nIt seems pretty sure that Byng was determined beforehand to seize or\r\ndestroy the Spanish fleet, and that as a military man he was justified\r\nby his orders. The Spanish naval officers had not made up their minds\r\nto any line of conduct; they were much inferior in numbers, and, as\r\nmust always be the case, Alberoni's hastily revived navy had not\r\nwithin the same period reached nearly the efficiency of his army. The\r\nEnglish approached threateningly near, one or more Spanish ships\r\nopened fire, whereupon the English, being to windward, stood down and\r\nmade an end of them; a few only escaped into Valetta harbor. The\r\nSpanish navy was practically annihilated. It is difficult to\r\nunderstand the importance attached by some writers to Byng's action at\r\nthis time in attacking without regard to the line-of-battle. He had\r\nbefore him a disorderly force, much inferior both in numbers and\r\ndiscipline. His merit seems rather to lie in the readiness to assume a\r\nresponsibility from which a more scrupulous man might have shrunk; but\r\nin this and throughout the campaign he rendered good service to\r\nEngland, whose sea power was again strengthened by the destruction not\r\nof an actual but a possible rival, and his services were rewarded by a\r\npeerage. In connection with this day's work was written a despatch\r\nwhich has great favor with English historians. One of the senior\r\ncaptains was detached with a division against some escaping ships of\r\nthe enemy. His report to the admiral ran thus: \"SIR,--We have taken or\r\ndestroyed all the Spanish ships upon this coast, the number as per\r\nmargin. Respectfully, etc., G. Walton.\" One English writer makes, and\r\nanother indorses, the uncalled-for but characteristic fling at the\r\nFrench, that the ships thus thrust into the margin would have filled\r\nsome pages of a French narration.[81] It may be granted that the\r\nso-called \"battle\" of Cape Passaro did not merit a long description,\r\nand Captain Walton possibly felt so; but if all reports of naval\r\ntransactions were modelled upon his, the writing of naval history\r\nwould not depend on official papers.\r\n\r\nThus the Spanish navy was struck down on the 11th of August, 1718,\r\noff Cape Passaro. This settled the fate of Sicily, if it had been\r\ndoubtful before. The English fleet cruised round the island,\r\nsupporting the Austrians and isolating the Spaniards, none of whom\r\nwere permitted to withdraw before peace was made. Alberoni's\r\ndiplomatic projects failed one after the other, with a strange\r\nfatality. In the following year the French, in pursuance of the terms\r\nof the alliance, invaded the north of Spain and destroyed the\r\ndock-yards; burning nine large ships on the stocks, besides the\r\nmaterials for seven more, at the instigation of an English _attaché_\r\naccompanying the French headquarters. Thus was completed the\r\ndestruction of the Spanish navy, which, says an English historian, was\r\nascribed to the maritime jealousy of England. \"This was done,\" wrote\r\nthe French commander, the Duke of Berwick, a bastard of the house of\r\nStuart, \"in order that the English government may be able to show the\r\nnext Parliament that nothing has been neglected to diminish the navy\r\nof Spain.\" The acts of Sir George Byng, as given by the English naval\r\nhistorian, make yet more manifest the purpose of England at this time.\r\nWhile the city and citadel of Messina were being besieged by the\r\nAustrians, English, and Sardinians, a dispute arose as to the\r\npossession of the Spanish men-of-war within the mole. Byng,\r\n\"reflecting within himself that possibly the garrison might capitulate\r\nfor the safe return of those ships into Spain, which he was determined\r\nnot to suffer; that on the other hand the right of possession might\r\nbreed an inconvenient dispute at a critical juncture among the princes\r\nconcerned, and if it should at length be determined that they did not\r\nbelong to England it were better they belonged to no one else,\r\nproposed to Count de Merci, the Austrian general, to erect a battery\r\nand destroy them as they lay.\"[82] After some demur on the part of the\r\nother leaders, this was done. If constant care and watchfulness\r\ndeserve success, England certainly deserved her sea power; but what\r\nshall be said of the folly of France at this time and in this\r\nconnection?\r\n\r\nThe steady stream of reverses, and the hopelessness of contending for\r\ndistant maritime possessions when without a navy, broke down the\r\nresistance of Spain. England and France insisted upon the dismissal of\r\nAlberoni, and Philip yielded to the terms of the Quadruple Alliance.\r\nThe Austrian power, necessarily friendly to England, was thus firmly\r\nsettled in the central Mediterranean, in Naples and Sicily, as England\r\nherself was in Gibraltar and Port Mahon. Sir Robert Walpole, the\r\nminister now coming into power in England, failed at a later day to\r\nsupport this favorable conjunction, and so far betrayed the\r\ntraditional policy of his country. The dominion of the House of Savoy\r\nin Sardinia, which then began, has lasted; it is only within our own\r\nday that the title King of Sardinia has merged in the broader one of\r\nKing of Italy.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with and for some time after the short episode of\r\nAlberoni's ministry and Spain's ambition, a struggle was going on\r\naround the shores of the Baltic which must be mentioned, because it\r\ngave rise to another effectual illustration of the sea power of\r\nEngland, manifested alike in the north and south with a slightness of\r\nexertion which calls to mind the stories of the tap of a tiger's paw.\r\nThe long contest between Sweden and Russia was for a moment\r\ninterrupted in 1718, by negotiations looking to peace and to an\r\nalliance between the two for the settlement of the succession in\r\nPoland and the restoration of the Stuarts in England. This project, on\r\nwhich had rested many of Alberoni's hopes, was finally stopped by the\r\ndeath in battle of the Swedish king. The war went on; and the czar,\r\nseeing the exhaustion of Sweden, purposed its entire subjugation. This\r\ndestruction of the balance of power in the Baltic, making it a Russian\r\nlake, suited neither England nor France; especially the former, whose\r\nsea power both for peace and war depended upon the naval stores\r\nchiefly drawn from those regions. The two western kingdoms interfered,\r\nboth by diplomacy, while England besides sent her fleet. Denmark,\r\nwhich was also at war with her traditional enemy Sweden, readily\r\nyielded; but Peter the Great chafed heavily under the implied\r\ncoercion, until at last orders were sent to the English admiral to\r\njoin his fleet to that of the Swedes and repeat in the Baltic the\r\nhistory of Cape Passaro. The czar in alarm withdrew his fleet. This\r\nhappened in 1719; but Peter, though baffled, was not yet subdued. The\r\nfollowing year the interposition of England was repeated with greater\r\neffect, although not in time to save the Swedish coasts from serious\r\ninjury; but the czar, recognizing the fixed purpose with which he had\r\nto deal, and knowing from personal observation and practical\r\nexperience the efficiency of England's sea power, consented finally to\r\npeace. The French claim much for their own diplomacy in this happy\r\nresult, and say that England supported Sweden feebly; being willing\r\nthat she should lose her provinces on the eastern shore of the Baltic\r\nbecause Russia, thus brought down to the sea-shore, could more easily\r\nopen to English trade the vast resources of her interior. This may\r\nvery possibly be true, and certainty can be felt that British\r\ninterests, especially as to commerce and sea power, were looked after;\r\nbut the character of Peter the Great is the guarantee that the\r\nargument which weighed most heavily with him was the military\r\nefficiency of the British fleet and its ability to move up to his very\r\ndoors. By this Peace of Nystadt, August 30, 1721, Sweden abandoned\r\nLivonia, Esthonia, and other provinces on the east side of the Baltic.\r\nThis result was inevitable; it was yearly becoming less possible for\r\nsmall States to hold their own.\r\n\r\nIt can readily be understood that Spain was utterly discontented with\r\nthe terms wrung from her by the Quadruple Alliance. The twelve years\r\nwhich followed are called years of peace, but the peace was very\r\nuncertain, and fraught with elements of future wars. The three great\r\ngrievances rankling with Spain were--Sicily and Naples in the\r\npossession of Austria, Gibraltar and Mahon in the hands of England,\r\nand lastly, the vast contraband trade carried on by English merchants\r\nand ships in Spanish America. It will be seen that England was the\r\nactive supporter of all these injuries; England therefore was the\r\nspecial enemy of Spain, but Spain was not the only enemy of England.\r\n\r\nThe quiet, such as it was, that succeeded the fall of Alberoni was due\r\nmainly to the character and policy of the two ministers of France and\r\nEngland, who agreed in wishing a general peace. The policy and reasons\r\nof the French regent are already known. Moved by the same reasons, and\r\nto remove an accidental offence taken by England, Dubois obtained for\r\nher the further concession from Spain, additional to the commercial\r\nadvantages granted at Utrecht, of sending a ship every year to trade\r\nin the West Indies. It is said that this ship, after being anchored,\r\nwas kept continually supplied by others, so that fresh cargo came in\r\nover one side as fast as the old was sent ashore from the other.\r\nDubois and the regent both died in the latter half of 1723, after an\r\nadministration of eight years, in which they had reversed the policy\r\nof Richelieu by alliance with England and Austria and sacrificing to\r\nthem the interests of France.\r\n\r\nThe regency and the nominal government of France passed to another\r\nmember of the royal family; but the real ruler was Cardinal Fleuri,\r\nthe preceptor of the young king, who was now thirteen years of age.\r\nEfforts to displace the preceptor resulted only in giving him the\r\ntitle, as well as the power, of minister in 1726. At this time Sir\r\nRobert Walpole had become prime minister of England, with an influence\r\nand power which gave him practically the entire guidance of the policy\r\nof the State. The chief wish of both Walpole and Fleuri was peace,\r\nabove all in western Europe. France and England therefore continued to\r\nact together for that purpose, and though they could not entirely\r\nstifle every murmur, they were for several years successful in\r\npreventing outbreaks. But while the aims of the two ministers were\r\nthus agreed, the motives which inspired them were different. Walpole\r\ndesired peace because of the still unsettled condition of the English\r\nsuccession; for the peaceful growth of English commerce, which he had\r\never before his eyes; and probably also because his spirit, impatient\r\nof equals in the government, shrank from war which would raise up\r\nstronger men around him. Fleuri, reasonably secure as to the throne\r\nand his own power, wished like Walpole the peaceful development of his\r\ncountry, and shrank from war with the love of repose natural to old\r\nage; for he was seventy-three when he took office, and ninety when he\r\nlaid it down in death. Under his mild administration the prosperity of\r\nFrance revived; the passing traveller could note the change in the\r\nface of the country and of the people; yet it may be doubted whether\r\nthis change was due to the government of the quiet old man, or merely\r\nto the natural elasticity of the people, no longer drained by war nor\r\nisolated from the rest of the world. French authorities say that\r\nagriculture did not revive throughout the country. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that the maritime prosperity of France advanced wonderfully,\r\nowing mainly to the removal of commercial restrictions in the years\r\nimmediately following the death of Louis XIV. The West India islands\r\nin particular throve greatly, and their welfare was naturally shared\r\nby the home ports that traded with them. The tropical climate of\r\nMartinique, Guadeloupe, and Louisiana, and cultivation by slaves, lent\r\nthemselves readily to the paternal, semi-military government which\r\nmarks all French colonies, but which produced less happy results in\r\nthe bitter weather of Canada. In the West Indies, France at this time\r\nobtained a decided preponderance over England; the value of the French\r\nhalf of Hayti was alone equal to that of all the English West Indies,\r\nand French coffee and sugar were driving those of England out of\r\nEuropean markets. A like advantage over England in the Mediterranean\r\nand Levant trade is asserted by French historians. At the same time\r\nthe East India Company was revived, and its French depot, whose name\r\ntells its association with the East, the Breton town of L'Orient,\r\nquickly became a splendid city. Pondicherry on the Coromandel coast,\r\nand Chandernagore on the Ganges, the chief seats of French power and\r\ncommerce in India, grew rapidly; the Isle of Bourbon and the Isle of\r\nFrance, now the Mauritius, whose position is so well suited for the\r\ncontrol of the Indian Ocean, became, the one a rich agricultural\r\ncolony, the other a powerful naval station. The monopoly of the great\r\ncompany was confined to the trade between home and the chief Indian\r\nstations; the traffic throughout the Indian seas was open to private\r\nenterprise and grew more rapidly. This great movement, wholly\r\nspontaneous, and even looked on with distrust by the government, was\r\npersonified in two men, Dupleix and La Bourdonnais; who, the former at\r\nChandernagore and the latter at the Isle of France, pointed out and\r\nled the way in all these undertakings, which were building up the\r\npower and renown of the French in the Eastern seas. The movement was\r\nbegun which, after making France the rival of England in the Hindustan\r\npeninsula, and giving her for a moment the promise of that great\r\nempire which has bestowed a new title on the Queen of Great Britain,\r\nwas destined finally to falter and perish before the sea power of\r\nEngland. The extent of this expansion of French trade, consequent upon\r\npeace and the removal of restrictions, and not due in any sense to\r\ngovernment protection, is evidenced by the growth of French merchant\r\nshipping from only three hundred vessels at the death of Louis XIV.,\r\nto eighteen hundred, twenty years later. This, a French historian\r\nclaims, refutes \"the deplorable prejudices, born of our misfortunes,\r\nthat France is not fitted for sea commerce, the only commerce that\r\nindefinitely extends the power of a nation with its sphere of\r\nactivity.\"[83]\r\n\r\nThis free and happy movement of the people was far from acceptable to\r\nFleuri, who seems to have seen it with the distrust of a hen that has\r\nhatched ducklings. Walpole and himself were agreed to love peace; but\r\nWalpole was obliged to reckon with the English people, and these were\r\nprompt to resent rivalry upon the sea and in trade, however obtained.\r\nMoreover, Fleuri had inherited the unfortunate policy of Louis XIV.;\r\nhis eyes were fixed on the continent. He did not indeed wish to follow\r\nthe course of the regency in quarrelling with Spain, but rather to\r\ndraw near to her; and although he was not able for a time to do so\r\nwithout sacrificing his peace policy, because of Spain's restless\r\nenmity to England, yet his mind was chiefly bent upon strengthening\r\nthe position of France on the land, by establishing Bourbon princes\r\nwhere he could, and drawing them together by family alliances. The\r\nnavy was allowed to decay more and more. \"The French government\r\nabandoned the sea at the very moment that the nation, through the\r\nactivity of private individuals, was making an effort to regain it.\"\r\nThe material force fell to fifty-four ships-of-the-line and frigates,\r\nmostly in bad condition; and even when war with England had been\r\nimminent for five years, France had but forty-five ships-of-the-line\r\nto England's ninety. This difference foreshadowed the results which\r\nfollowed a quarter of a century of war.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period Walpole, relying upon Fleuri's co-operation,\r\nresolutely set his face against open war between England and Spain.\r\nThe difficulties caused by the threatening and exasperating action of\r\nthe latter country, and of such allies as she from time to time could\r\nraise, were met, and for a while successfully met, by naval\r\ndemonstrations,--reminders of that sea power which one nation after\r\nanother had felt and yielded to. In 1725, the Spanish king and the\r\nemperor agreed to sink their long-standing feud, and signed a treaty\r\nat Vienna, in which there was a secret clause providing that the\r\nemperor would support the claim of Spain to Gibraltar and Port Mahon,\r\nby arms if necessary. Russia also showed a disposition to join this\r\nconfederacy. A counter-alliance was formed between England, France,\r\nand Prussia; and English fleets were sent, one to the Baltic to awe\r\nthe czarina, another to the coast of Spain to check that government\r\nand protect Gibraltar, and a third to Porto Bello, on the Spanish\r\nMain, to blockade the fleet of galleons there assembled, and by\r\ncutting off the supplies remind the Spanish king at once of his\r\ndependence upon the specie of America, and of England's control of the\r\nhighway by which it reached him. Walpole's aversion to war was marked\r\nby giving the admiral at Porto Bello the strictest orders not to\r\nfight, only to blockade; the consequence of which, through the long\r\ndelay of the squadron upon the sickly coast, was a mortality among\r\nthe crews that shocked the nation, and led, among other causes, to the\r\nminister's overthrow many years later. Between three and four thousand\r\nofficers and men, including Admiral Hosier himself, died there.\r\nWalpole's aim, however, was reached; though Spain made a foolish\r\nattack by land upon Gibraltar, the presence of the English fleet\r\nassured its supplies and provisions and averted the formal outbreak of\r\nwar. The emperor withdrew from the alliance, and under English\r\npressure also revoked the charter of an East India company which he\r\nhad authorized in the Austrian Netherlands, and which took its name\r\nfrom the port of Ostend. English merchants demanded the removal of\r\nthis competitor, and also of a similar rival established in Denmark;\r\nboth which concessions the English ministry, backed by Holland,\r\nobtained. So long as commerce was not seriously disturbed, Walpole's\r\npeace policy, accompanied as it naturally was by years of plenty and\r\ngeneral content, was easily maintained, even though Spain continued\r\nthreatening and arrogant in her demands for Gibraltar; but\r\nunfortunately she now entered more deeply upon a course of annoyance\r\nto English trade. The concessions of the Asiento, or slave-trade, and\r\nof the annual ship to South America have been mentioned; but these\r\nprivileges were but a part of the English commerce in those regions.\r\nThe system of Spain with regard to the trade of her colonies was of\r\nthe narrowest and most exclusive character; but, while attempting to\r\nshut them out from foreign traffic, she neglected to provide for their\r\nwants herself. The consequence was that a great smuggling or\r\ncontraband trade arose throughout her American possessions, carried on\r\nmainly by the English, who made their lawful traffic by the Asiento\r\nand the yearly ship subserve also the unlawful, or at least\r\nunauthorized, trade. This system was doubtless advantageous to the\r\ngreat body of the Spanish colonists, and was encouraged by them, while\r\ncolonial governors connived at it, sometimes for money, sometimes\r\nswayed by local public opinion and their own knowledge of the\r\nhardships of the case; but there were Spanish subjects who saw their\r\nown business injured by the use and abuse of English privileges, and\r\nthe national government suffered both in pocket and in pride by these\r\nevasions of the revenue. It now began to pull the strings tighter.\r\nObsolete regulations were revived and enforced. Words in which the\r\naction of Spain in this old controversy have been described are\r\ncuriously applicable to certain recent disputes to which the United\r\nStates has been a party. \"The letter of the treaty was now followed,\r\nthough the spirit which dictated it was abandoned. Although English\r\nships still enjoyed the liberty of putting into Spanish harbors for\r\nthe purpose of refitting and provisioning, yet they were far from\r\nenjoying the same advantages of carrying on a friendly and commercial\r\nintercourse. They were now watched with a scrupulous jealousy,\r\nstrictly visited by guarda-costas, and every efficient means adopted\r\nto prevent any commerce with the colonies, except what was allowed by\r\nthe annual ship.\" If Spain could have confined herself to closer\r\nwatchfulness and to enforcing in her own waters vexatious customs\r\nregulations, not essentially different from those sanctioned by the\r\ngeneral commercial ideas of that day, perhaps no further harm would\r\nhave resulted; but the condition of things and the temper of her\r\ngovernment would not let her stop there. It was not possible to guard\r\nand effectually seal a sea-coast extending over hundreds of miles,\r\nwith innumerable inlets; nor would traders and seamen, in pursuit of\r\ngain which they had come to consider their right, be deterred by fears\r\nof penalties nor consideration for Spanish susceptibilities. The power\r\nof Spain was not great enough to enforce on the English ministry any\r\nregulation of their shipping, or stoppage of the abuse of the treaty\r\nprivileges, in face of the feelings of the merchants; and so the\r\nweaker State, wronged and harassed, was goaded into the use of wholly\r\nunlawful means. Ships-of-war and guarda-costas were instructed, or at\r\nleast permitted, to stop and search English ships on the high seas,\r\noutside of Spanish jurisdiction; and the arrogant Spanish temper,\r\nunrestrained by the weak central government, made many of these\r\nvisits, both the lawful and the unlawful, scenes of insult and even\r\nviolence. Somewhat similar results, springing from causes not entirely\r\ndifferent, have occurred in the relations of Spanish officials to the\r\nUnited States and American merchant-ships in our own day. The stories\r\nof these acts of violence coming back to England, coupled with cases\r\nof loss by confiscation and by the embarrassment of trade, of course\r\nstirred up the people. In 1737 the West India merchants petitioned the\r\nHouse of Commons, saying,--\r\n\r\n    \"For many years past their ships have not only frequently been\r\n    stopped and searched, but also forcibly and arbitrarily seized\r\n    upon the high seas, by Spanish ships fitted out to cruise, under\r\n    the plausible pretext of guarding their own coasts; that the\r\n    commanders thereof, with their crews, have been inhumanly\r\n    treated, and their ships carried into some of the Spanish ports\r\n    and there condemned with their cargoes, in manifest violation of\r\n    the treaties subsisting between the two crowns; that the\r\n    remonstrances of his Majesty's ministers at Madrid receive no\r\n    attention, and that insults and plunder must soon destroy their\r\n    trade.\"\r\n\r\nWalpole struggled hard, during the ten years following 1729, to keep\r\noff war. In that year a treaty signed at Seville professed to regulate\r\nmatters, restoring the conditions of trade to what they had been four\r\nyears before, and providing that six thousand Spanish troops should at\r\nonce occupy the territory of Tuscany and Parma. Walpole argued with\r\nhis own people that war would lose them the commercial privileges they\r\nalready enjoyed in Spanish dominions; while with Spain he carried on\r\nconstant negotiations, seeking concessions and indemnities that might\r\nsilence the home clamor. In the midst of this period a war broke out\r\nconcerning the succession to the Polish throne. The father-in-law of\r\nthe French king was one claimant; Austria supported his opponent. A\r\ncommon hostility to Austria once more drew France and Spain together,\r\nand they were joined by the King of Sardinia, who hoped through this\r\nalliance to wrest Milan from Austria and add it to his own territory\r\nof Piedmont. The neutrality of England and Holland was secured by a\r\npromise not to attack the Austrian Netherlands, the possession of any\r\npart of which by France was considered to be dangerous to England's\r\nsea power. The allied States declared war against Austria in October,\r\n1733, and their armies entered Italy together; but the Spaniards,\r\nintent on their long-cherished projects against Naples and Sicily,\r\nleft the others and turned southward. The two kingdoms were easily and\r\nquickly conquered, the invaders having command of the sea and the\r\nfavor of the population. The second son of the King of Spain was\r\nproclaimed king under the title of Carlos III., and the Bourbon\r\nKingdom of the Two Sicilies thus came into existence. Walpole's\r\naversion to war, leading him to abandon a long-standing ally, thus\r\nresulted in the transfer of the central Mediterranean to a control\r\nnecessarily unfriendly to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBut while Walpole thus forsook the emperor, he was himself betrayed by\r\nhis friend Fleuri. While making the open alliance with Spain against\r\nAustria, the French government agreed to a secret clause directed\r\nagainst England. This engagement ran as follows: \"Whenever it seems\r\ngood to both nations alike, the abuses which have crept into commerce,\r\nespecially through the English, shall be abolished; and if the English\r\nmake objection, France will ward off their hostility with all its\r\nstrength by land and sea.\" \"And this compact was made,\" as the\r\nbiographer of Lord Hawke points out, \"during a period of intimate and\r\nostentatious alliance with England itself.\"[84] \"Thus the policy\r\nagainst which William III. had called on England and Europe to arm, at\r\nlast came into existence.\" Had Walpole known of this secret agreement,\r\nit might have seemed to him an additional argument in favor of peace;\r\nfor, his keen political sagacity warning him of the existence of a\r\ndanger which he yet could not see, he told the House of Commons that\r\n\"if the Spaniards had not private encouragement from powers more\r\nconsiderable than themselves, they would never have ventured on the\r\ninsults and injuries which have been proved at your bar;\" and he\r\nexpressed the opinion that \"England was not a match for the French and\r\nSpaniards too.\"\r\n\r\nFleuri had indeed given his old friend and fellow-statesman an ugly\r\nfall. The particular question which excited the two years' War of the\r\nPolish Succession, the choice of a ruler for a distracted kingdom\r\nfated soon to disappear from the list of European States, seems a\r\nsmall matter; but the turn imparted to European politics by the action\r\nof the powers engaged gives it a very different importance. France and\r\nAustria came to an arrangement in October, 1735, upon terms to which\r\nSardinia and Spain afterward acceded, the principal points of which\r\nwere as follows: The French claimant to the Polish throne gave up his\r\nclaim to it, and received instead the duchies of Bar and Lorraine on\r\nthe east of France, with the provision that upon his death they were\r\nto go to his son-in-law, the King of France, in full sovereignty; the\r\ntwo kingdoms of Sicily and Naples were confirmed to the Spanish\r\nBourbon prince, Don Carlos; and Austria received back Parma. The\r\nSardinian monarchy also got an increase to its Italian territory.\r\nFrance thus, under the peace-loving Fleuri, obtained in Bar and\r\nLorraine an accession of strength which more warlike rulers had\r\ncoveted in vain; and at the same time her external position was\r\nfortified at the expense of England, by the transfer of controlling\r\npositions in the central Mediterranean to an ally. Yet the heart of\r\nFleuri might well have failed him as he remembered the secret\r\nagreement to check the commerce of England, and thought of her mighty\r\nsea power alongside of the decayed navy of France. That compact\r\nbetween France and Spain, to which the Two Sicilies acceded later,\r\nbore within it, in the then strained relations between England and\r\nSpain, the germ of the great wars between England and the House of\r\nBourbon which issued in the creation of the British Empire and the\r\nindependence of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe clamor in England over Spanish outrages continued, and was\r\ncarefully nursed by the opposition to Walpole. The minister was now\r\nover sixty years of age, and scarcely able to change the settled\r\nconvictions and policy of his prime. He was face to face with one of\r\nthose irrepressible conflicts between nations and races toward which a\r\npolicy of repression and compromise can be employed but for a short\r\ntime. The English were bent upon opening the West Indies and Spanish\r\nAmerica, the Spanish government equally bent upon obstructing them.\r\nUnfortunately for their policy of obstruction, they strengthened\r\nWalpole's enemies by unlawful search of English ships on the open sea,\r\nand possibly also by outrages to English seamen. Some of the latter\r\nwere brought before the bar of the House of Commons, and testified\r\nthat they had been not merely plundered, but tortured, shut up in\r\nprison, and compelled to live and work under loathsome conditions. The\r\nmost celebrated case was that of a certain Jenkins, the master of a\r\nmerchant-brig, who told that a Spanish officer had torn off one of his\r\nears, bidding him carry it to the king his master, and say that if he\r\nhad been there he would have been served likewise. Being asked what\r\nwere his feelings at such a moment of danger and suffering, he was\r\nsaid to have replied, \"I commended my soul to God and my cause to my\r\ncountry.\" This well-turned dramatic utterance from the mouth of a man\r\nof his class throws a suspicion of high coloring over the whole story;\r\nbut it can be readily imagined what a capital campaign-cry it would be\r\nin the heat of a popular movement. The tide of feeling swept away\r\nWalpole's patchwork of compromise, and war was declared against Spain\r\nby Great Britain on the 19th of October, 1739. The English ultimatum\r\ninsisted upon a formal renunciation of the right of search as claimed\r\nand exercised by the Spaniards, and upon an express acknowledgment of\r\nthe British claims in North America. Among these claims was one\r\nrelating to the limits of Georgia, then a recently established colony,\r\ntouching the Spanish territory of Florida.\r\n\r\nHow far the war thus urged on and begun by England, against the\r\njudgment of her able minister, was morally justifiable has been warmly\r\nargued on either side by English writers. The laws of Spain with\r\nregard to the trade of her colonies did not differ in spirit from\r\nthose of England herself as shown by her Navigation Act, and Spanish\r\nnaval officers found themselves in a position nearly identical with\r\nthat of Nelson when captain of a frigate in the West Indies half a\r\ncentury later. American ships and merchants then, after the separation\r\nfrom the mother-country, continued the trade which they had enjoyed as\r\ncolonists; Nelson, zealous for the commercial advantage of England as\r\nthen understood, undertook to enforce the act, and in so doing found\r\nagainst him the feeling of the West Indians and of the colonial\r\nauthorities. It does not seem that he or those supporting him searched\r\nunlawfully, for the power of England was great enough to protect her\r\nshipping interests without using irregular means; whereas Spain\r\nbetween 1730 and 1740, being weak, was tempted, as she has since been,\r\nto seize those whom she knew to have injured her wherever she could\r\nfind them, even outside her lawful jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the entirely sympathetic presentation of the case of\r\nWalpole's opponents, urging war, which is given by Professor Burrows\r\nin his Life of Lord Hawke, a foreigner can scarcely fail to conclude\r\nthat the Spaniards were grievously wronged, according to the rights of\r\nthe mother-country over colonies as commonly admitted in that day;\r\nthough no nation could tolerate the right of search as claimed by\r\nthem. It chiefly concerns our subject to notice that the dispute was\r\nradically a maritime question, that it grew out of the uncontrollable\r\nimpulse of the English people to extend their trade and colonial\r\ninterests. It is possible that France was acting under a similar\r\nimpulse, as English writers have asserted; but the character and\r\ngeneral policy of Fleuri, as well as the genius of the French people,\r\nmake this unlikely. There was no Parliament and no opposition to make\r\nknown popular opinion in the France of that day, and very different\r\nestimates of Fleuri's character and administration have found voice\r\nsince then. The English look rather at the ability which obtained\r\nLorraine for France and the Sicilies for the House of Bourbon, and\r\nblame Walpole for being overreached. The French say of Fleuri that \"he\r\nlived from day to day seeking only to have quiet in his old age. He\r\nhad stupefied France with opiates, instead of laboring to cure her. He\r\ncould not even prolong this silent sleep until his own death.\"[85]\r\nWhen the war broke out between England and Spain, \"the latter claimed\r\nthe advantage of her defensive alliance with France. Fleuri,\r\ngrievously against his will, was forced to fit out a squadron; he did\r\nso in niggardly fashion.\" This squadron, of twenty-two ships, convoyed\r\nto America the Spanish fleet assembled at Ferrol, and the\r\nreinforcement prevented the English from attacking.[86] \"Still, Fleuri\r\nmade explanations to Walpole and hoped for compromise,--an ill-founded\r\nhope, which had disastrous results for our sea interests, and\r\nprevented measures which would have given France, from the beginning\r\nof the war, the superiority in eastern seas.\" But \"upon Walpole's\r\noverthrow,\" says another Frenchman, \"Fleuri perceived his mistake in\r\nletting the navy decay. Its importance had lately struck him. He knew\r\nthat the kings of Naples and Sardinia forsook the French alliance\r\nmerely because an English squadron threatened to bombard Naples and\r\nGenoa and to bring an army into Italy. For lack of this element of\r\ngreatness, France silently swallowed the greatest humiliations, and\r\ncould only complain of the violence of English cruisers, which\r\npillaged our commerce, in violation of the law of nations,\"[87] during\r\nthe years of nominal peace that elapsed between the time when the\r\nFrench fleet was confined to protecting the Spanish against the\r\nEnglish and the outbreak of formal war. The explanation of these\r\ndiffering views seems not very hard. The two ministers had tacitly\r\nagreed to follow lines which apparently could not cross. France was\r\nleft free to expand by land, provided she did not excite the jealousy\r\nof the English people, and Walpole's own sense of English interests,\r\nby rivalry at sea. This course suited Fleuri's views and wishes. The\r\none sought power by sea, the other by land. Which had been wiser, war\r\nwas to show; for, with Spain as an ally to one party, war had to come,\r\nand that on the sea. Neither minister lived to see the result of his\r\npolicy. Walpole was driven from power in 1742, and died in March,\r\n1745. Fleuri died in office, January 29, 1743.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[80] Afterward Lord Torrington; father of Admiral John Byng, shot in\r\n1757.\r\n\r\n[81] Campbell: Lives of the Admirals; quoted by Lord Mahon in his\r\nHistory of England.\r\n\r\n[82] Lives of the Admirals\r\n\r\n[83] Martin: History of France.\r\n\r\n[84] Burrows: Life of Lord Hawke.\r\n\r\n[85] Martin: History of France.\r\n\r\n[86] The peculiar political relation which France bore toward England\r\nbetween 1739 and 1744, while the latter country was at war with Spain,\r\nneeds to be explained, as it depended upon views of international\r\nduties which are practically obsolete. By her defensive alliance with\r\nSpain, France had bound herself to furnish a contingent of specified\r\nforce to the Spanish fleet when that country was involved in war of a\r\ncertain kind. She claimed, however, that her sending these succors was\r\nnot such an act of hostility to England as involved a breach of the\r\npeace existing between the two nations. The French ships-of-war, while\r\nthus serving with the Spanish fleet under the terms of the treaty,\r\nwere enemies; but the French nation and all other armed forces of\r\nFrance, on sea and land, were neutrals, with all the privileges of\r\nneutrality. Of course England was not bound to accept this view of the\r\nmatter, and could make the action of France a _casus belli_; but\r\nFrance claimed it was not justly so, and England practically conceded\r\nthe claim, though the relation was likely to lead to formal war, as it\r\ndid in 1744. A few years later the Dutch will be found claiming the\r\nsame privilege of neutrality toward France while furnishing a large\r\ncontingent to the Austrian army acting against her.\r\n\r\n[87] Lapeyrouse-Bonfils: Hist. de la Marine Française.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    WAR BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND SPAIN, 1739.--WAR OF THE AUSTRIAN\r\n    SUCCESSION, 1740.--FRANCE JOINS SPAIN AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN,\r\n    1744.--SEA BATTLES OF MATTHEWS, ANSON, AND HAWKE.--PEACE OF\r\n    AIX-LA-CHAPELLE, 1748.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the opening of a series of great wars, destined to\r\nlast with short intervals of peace for nearly half a century, and\r\nhaving, amid many misleading details, one broad characteristic\r\ndistinguishing them from previous, and from many subsequent, wars.\r\nThis strife embraced the four quarters of the world, and that not only\r\nas side issues here and there, the main struggle being in Europe; for\r\nthe great questions to be determined by it, concerning the world's\r\nhistory, were the dominion of the sea and the control of distant\r\ncountries, the possession of colonies, and, dependent upon these, the\r\nincrease of wealth. Singularly enough it is not till nearly the end of\r\nthe long contest that great fleets are found engaging, and the\r\nstruggle transferred to its proper field, the sea. The action of sea\r\npower is evident enough, the issue plainly indicated from the\r\nbeginning; but for a long time there is no naval warfare of any\r\nconsequence, because the truth is not recognized by the French\r\ngovernment. The movement toward colonial extension by France is wholly\r\npopular, though illustrated by a few great names; the attitude of the\r\nrulers is cold and mistrustful: hence came neglect of the navy, a\r\nforegone conclusion of defeat on the main question, and destruction\r\nfor the time of her sea power.\r\n\r\nSuch being the character of the coming wars, it is important to\r\nrealize the relative positions of the three great powers in those\r\nquarters of the world, outside of Europe, where the strife was to\r\nengage.\r\n\r\nIn North America, England now held the thirteen colonies, the original\r\nUnited States, from Maine to Georgia. In these colonies was to be\r\nfound the highest development of that form of colonization peculiar to\r\nEngland, bodies of free men essentially self-governing and\r\nself-dependent, still enthusiastically loyal, and by occupation at\r\nonce agricultural, commercial, and sea-faring. In the character of\r\ntheir country and its productions, in its long sea-coast and sheltered\r\nharbors, and in their own selves, they had all the elements of sea\r\npower, which had already received large development. On such a country\r\nand such a people the royal navy and army were securely based in the\r\nwestern hemisphere. The English colonists were intensely jealous of\r\nthe French and Canadians.\r\n\r\nFrance held Canada and Louisiana, a name much more extensive in its\r\napplication then than now, and claimed the entire valley of the Ohio\r\nand Mississippi, by right of prior discovery, and as a necessary link\r\nbetween the St. Lawrence and the Gulf of Mexico. There was as yet no\r\nadequate occupation of this intermediate country, nor was the claim\r\nadmitted by England, whose colonists asserted the right to extend\r\nindefinitely westward. The strength of the French position was in\r\nCanada; the St. Lawrence gave them access to the heart of the country,\r\nand though Newfoundland and Nova Scotia had been lost, in Cape Breton\r\nIsland they still held the key of the gulf and river. Canada had the\r\ncharacteristics of the French colonial system planted in a climate\r\nleast suited to it. A government paternal, military, and monkish\r\ndiscouraged the development of individual enterprise and of free\r\nassociation for common ends. The colonists abandoned commerce and\r\nagriculture, raising only food enough for immediate consumption, and\r\nwere given to arms and hunting. Their chief traffic was in furs. There\r\nwas so little mechanical art among them that they bought of the\r\nEnglish colonies part of the vessels for their interior navigation.\r\nThe chief element of strength was the military, arms-bearing character\r\nof the population; each man was a soldier.\r\n\r\nBesides the hostility inherited from the mother-countries, there was a\r\nnecessary antagonism between two social and political systems, so\r\ndirectly opposed, and lying one alongside the other. The remoteness of\r\nCanada from the West Indies, and the inhospitable winter climate, made\r\nit, from the naval point of view, of much less value to France than\r\nthe English colonies to England; besides which the resources and\r\npopulation were greatly inferior. In 1750 the population of Canada was\r\neighty thousand, that of the English colonies twelve hundred thousand.\r\nWith such disparity of strength and resources, the only chance for\r\nCanada lay in the support of the sea power of France, either by direct\r\ncontrol of the neighboring seas, or by such powerful diversion\r\nelsewhere as would relieve the pressure upon her.\r\n\r\nOn the continent of North America, in addition to Mexico and the\r\ncountries south of it, Spain held Florida; under which name were\r\nembraced extensive regions beyond the peninsula, not accurately\r\ndefined, and having little importance at any period of these long\r\nwars.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies and South America, Spain held mainly what are still\r\nknown as Spanish American countries, besides Cuba, Porto Rico, and\r\npart of Hayti; France had Guadeloupe, Martinique, and the western half\r\nof Hayti; England, Jamaica, Barbadoes, and some of the smaller\r\nislands. The fertile character of the soil, the commercial\r\nproductions, and the less rigorous climate would seem to make these\r\nislands objects of particular ambition in a colonial war; but as a\r\nmatter of fact no attempt was made, nor, except as to Jamaica, which\r\nSpain wished to recover, was any intention entertained of conquering\r\nany of the larger islands. The reason probably was that England, whose\r\nsea power made her the principal aggressor, was influenced in the\r\ndirection of her efforts by the wishes of the great body of Englishmen\r\non the North American continent. The smaller West India islands are\r\nsingly too small to be strongly held except by a power controlling the\r\nsea. They had a twofold value in war: one as offering military\r\npositions for such a power: the other a commercial value, either as\r\nadding to one's own resources or diminishing those of the enemy. War\r\ndirected against them may be considered as a war upon commerce, and\r\nthe islands themselves as ships or convoys loaded with enemy's wealth.\r\nThey will be found therefore changing hands like counters, and usually\r\nrestored when peace comes; though the final result was to leave most\r\nof them in the hands of England. Nevertheless, the fact of each of the\r\ngreat powers having a share in this focus of commerce drew thither\r\nboth large fleets and small squadrons, a tendency aided by the\r\nunfavorable seasons for military operations on the continent; and in\r\nthe West Indies took place the greater number of the fleet-actions\r\nthat illustrated this long series of wars.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PENINSULA OF INDIA AND CEYLON.]\r\n\r\nIn yet another remote region was the strife between England and France\r\nto be waged, and there, as in North America, finally decided by these\r\nwars. In India, the rival nations were represented by their East India\r\ncompanies, who directly administered both government and commerce.\r\nBack of them, of course, were the mother-countries; but in immediate\r\ncontact with the native rulers were the presidents and officers\r\nappointed by the companies. At this time the principal settlements of\r\nthe English were,--on the west coast, Bombay; on the east, Calcutta\r\nupon the Ganges, at some distance from the sea, and Madras; while a\r\nlittle south of Madras another town and station, known generally to\r\nthe English as Fort St. David, though sometimes called Cuddalore, had\r\nbeen established later. The three presidencies of Bombay, Calcutta,\r\nand Madras were at this time mutually independent, and responsible\r\nonly to the Court of Directors in England.\r\n\r\nFrance was established at Chandernagore, on the Ganges, above\r\nCalcutta; at Pondicherry, on the east coast, eighty miles south of\r\nMadras; and on the west coast, far to the south of Bombay, she had a\r\nthird station of inferior importance, called Mahé. The French,\r\nhowever, had a great advantage in the possession of the intermediate\r\nstation already pointed out in the Indian Ocean, the neighboring\r\nislands of France and Bourbon. They were yet more fortunate in the\r\npersonal character of the two men who were at this time at the head\r\nof their affairs in the Indian peninsula and the islands, Dupleix and\r\nLa Bourdonnais,--men to whom no rivals in ability or force of\r\ncharacter had as yet appeared among the English Indian officials. Yet\r\nin these two men, whose cordial fellow-working might have ruined the\r\nEnglish settlement in India, there appeared again that singular\r\nconflict of ideas, that hesitation between the land and the sea as the\r\nstay of power, a prophecy of which seems to be contained in the\r\ngeographical position of France itself. The mind of Dupleix, though\r\nnot inattentive to commercial interests, was fixed on building up a\r\ngreat empire in which France should rule over a multitude of vassal\r\nnative princes. In the pursuit of this end he displayed great tact and\r\nuntiring activity, perhaps also a somewhat soaring and fantastic\r\nimagination; but when he met La Bourdonnais, whose simpler and sounder\r\nviews aimed at sea supremacy, at a dominion based upon free and\r\ncertain communication with the home country instead of the shifting\r\nsands of Eastern intrigues and alliances, discord at once arose.\r\n\"Naval inferiority,\" says a French historian who considers Dupleix to\r\nhave had the higher aims, \"was the principal cause that arrested his\r\nprogress;\"[88] but naval superiority was precisely the point at which\r\nLa Bourdonnais, himself a seaman and the governor of an island, aimed.\r\nIt may be that with the weakness of Canada, compared to the English\r\ncolonies, sea power could not there have changed the actual issue; but\r\nin the condition of the rival nations in India everything depended\r\nupon controlling the sea.\r\n\r\nSuch were the relative situations of the three countries in the\r\nprincipal foreign theatres of war. No mention has been made of the\r\ncolonies on the west coast of Africa, because they were mere trading\r\nstations having no military importance. The Cape of Good Hope was in\r\npossession of the Dutch, who took no active part in the earlier wars,\r\nbut long maintained toward England a benevolent neutrality, surviving\r\nfrom the alliance in the former wars of the century. It is necessary\r\nto mention briefly the condition of the military navies, which were\r\nto have an importance as yet unrealized. Neither precise numbers nor\r\nan exact account of condition of the ships can be given; but the\r\nrelative efficiency can be fairly estimated. Campbell, the English\r\ncontemporary naval historian, says that in 1727 the English navy had\r\neighty-four ships-of-the-line, from sixty guns up; forty 50-gun ships,\r\nand fifty-four frigates and smaller vessels. In 1734 this number had\r\nfallen to seventy ships-of-the-line and nineteen 50-gun ships. In\r\n1744, after four years of war with Spain alone, the number was ninety\r\nships-of-the-line and eighty-four frigates. The French navy at the\r\nsame time he estimates at forty-five ships-of-the-line and sixty-seven\r\nfrigates. In 1747, near the end of the first war, he says that the\r\nroyal navy of Spain was reduced to twenty-two ships-of-the-line, that\r\nof France to thirty-one, while the English had risen to one hundred\r\nand twenty-six. The French writers consulted are less precise in their\r\nfigures, but agree in representing not only that the navy was reduced\r\nto a pitiful number of ships, but that these were in bad condition and\r\nthe dock-yards destitute of materials. This neglect of the navy lasted\r\nmore or less throughout these wars, until 1760, when the sense of the\r\nnation was aroused to the importance of restoring it; too late,\r\nhowever, to prevent the most serious of the French losses. In England\r\nas well as in France discipline and administration had been sapped by\r\nthe long peace; the inefficiency of the armaments sent out was\r\nnotorious, and recalls the scandals that marked the outbreak of the\r\nCrimean War; while the very disappearance of the French ships led, by\r\nthe necessity of replacing them, to putting afloat vessels superior\r\nsingly, because more modern and scientific, to the older ships of the\r\nsame class in England. Care must be had, however, in accepting too\r\neasily the complaints of individual writers; French authors will be\r\nfound asserting that English ships are faster, while at the same\r\nperiod Englishmen complain that they are slower. It may be accepted as\r\ngenerally true that the French ships built between 1740 and 1800 were\r\nbetter designed and larger, class for class, than the English. The\r\nlatter had the undoubted superiority both in the number and quality\r\nof the seamen and officers. Keeping some fleets always afloat, whether\r\nbetter or worse, the officers could not quite lose touch of their\r\nprofession; whereas in France it is said that not one fifth of the\r\nofficers were, in 1744, employed. This superiority was kept and\r\nincreased by the practice, which henceforth obtained, of blockading\r\nthe French military ports with superior force; the enemy's squadrons\r\nwhen they put to sea found themselves at once at a disadvantage in\r\npoint of practical skill. On the other hand, large as was the number\r\nof English seamen, the demands of commerce were so great that war\r\nfound them scattered all over the world, and part of the fleet was\r\nalways paralyzed for lack of crews. This constant employment assured\r\ngood seamanship, but the absence of so many men had to be supplied by\r\nan indiscriminate press, which dragged in a class of miserable and\r\nsickly men, sadly diluting the quality of the whole. To realize the\r\ncondition of ships' companies of that day, it will be necessary only\r\nto read the accounts of those sent to Anson starting for a cruise\r\nround the world, or to Hawke when fitting out for war service; the\r\nstatements are now almost incredible, and the results most deplorable.\r\nIt was not a question of sanitation only; the material sent was\r\nentirely unfit to meet the conditions of sea life under the most\r\nfavorable circumstances. In both the French and English service a\r\ngreat deal of weeding among the officers was necessary. Those were the\r\npalmy days of court and political influence; and, moreover, it is not\r\npossible, after a long peace, at once to pick out from among the\r\nfairest-seeming the men who will best stand the tests of time and\r\nexposure to the responsibilities of war. There was in both nations a\r\ntendency to depend upon officers who had been in their prime a\r\ngeneration before, and the results were not fortunate.\r\n\r\nWar having been declared against Spain by England in October, 1739,\r\nthe first attempts of the latter power were naturally directed against\r\nthe Spanish-American colonies, the cause of the dispute, in which it\r\nwas expected to find an easy and rich prey. The first expedition\r\nsailed under Admiral Vernon in November of the same year, and took\r\nPorto Bello by a sudden and audacious stroke, but found only the\r\ninsignificant sum of ten thousand dollars in the port whence the\r\ngalleons sailed. Returning to Jamaica, Vernon received large\r\nreinforcements of ships, and was joined by a land force of twelve\r\nthousand troops. With this increased force, attempts were made upon\r\nboth Cartagena and Santiago de Cuba, in the years 1741 and 1742, but\r\nin both wretched failures resulted; the admiral and the general\r\nquarrelled, as was not uncommon in days when neither had an\r\nintelligent comprehension of the other's business. Marryatt, when\r\ncharacterizing such misunderstandings by a humorous exaggeration,\r\nseems to have had in view this attempt on Cartagena: \"The army thought\r\nthat the navy might have beaten down stone ramparts ten feet thick;\r\nand the navy wondered why the army had not walked up the same\r\nramparts, which were thirty feet perpendicular.\"\r\n\r\nAnother expedition, justly celebrated for the endurance and\r\nperseverance shown by its leader, and famous both for the hardships\r\nborne and singular final success, was sent out in 1740 under Anson.\r\nIts mission was to pass round Cape Horn and attack the Spanish\r\ncolonies on the west coast of South America. After many delays, due\r\napparently to bad administration, the squadron finally got away toward\r\nthe end of 1740. Passing the Cape at the worst season of the year, the\r\nships met a series of tempests of the most violent kind; the squadron\r\nwas scattered, never all to meet again, and Anson, after infinite\r\nperil, succeeded in rallying a part of it at Juan Fernandez. Two ships\r\nhad put back to England, a third was lost to the southward of Chiloe.\r\nWith the three left to him he cruised along the South American coast,\r\ntaking some prizes and pillaging the town of Payta, intending to touch\r\nnear Panama and join hands with Vernon for the capture of that place\r\nand the possession of the isthmus, if possible. Learning of the\r\ndisaster at Cartagena, he then determined to cross the Pacific and\r\nwaylay the two galleons that sailed yearly from Acapulco to Manila.\r\nIn the passage across, one of the two ships now left to him was found\r\nin such bad condition that she had to be destroyed. With the other he\r\nsucceeded in his last undertaking, capturing the great galleon with a\r\nmillion and a half dollars in specie. The expedition, from its many\r\nmisfortunes, had no military result beyond the terror and consequent\r\nembarrassment caused to the Spanish settlements; but its very\r\nmisfortunes, and the calm persistency which worked out a great success\r\nfrom them all, have given it a well-deserved renown.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1740 happened two events which led to a general\r\nEuropean war breaking in upon that in which Spain and England were\r\nalready engaged. In May of that year Frederick the Great became king\r\nof Prussia, and in October the emperor Charles VI., formerly the\r\nAustrian claimant of the Spanish throne, died. He had no son, and left\r\nby will the sovereignty of his estates to his eldest daughter, the\r\ncelebrated Maria Theresa, to secure whose succession the efforts of\r\nhis diplomacy had been directed for many years. This succession had\r\nbeen guaranteed by the European powers; but the apparent weakness of\r\nher position excited the ambitions of other sovereigns. The Elector of\r\nBavaria laid claim to the whole inheritance, in which he was supported\r\nby France; while the Prussian king claimed and seized the province of\r\nSilesia. Other powers, large and small, threw in their lot with one or\r\nthe other; while the position of England was complicated by her king\r\nbeing also elector of Hanover, and in that capacity hurriedly\r\ncontracting an obligation of neutrality for the electorate, although\r\nEnglish feeling was strongly in favor of Austria. Meanwhile the\r\nfailure of the Spanish-American expeditions and the severe losses of\r\nEnglish commerce increased the general outcry against Walpole, who\r\nresigned early in 1742. England under the new ministry became the open\r\nally of Austria; and Parliament voted not only a subsidy to the\r\nempress-queen, but also a body of troops to be sent as auxiliaries to\r\nthe Austrian Netherlands. At the same time Holland, under English\r\ninfluence, and bound like England by previous treaties to support the\r\nsuccession of Maria Theresa, also voted a subsidy. Here occurs again\r\nthat curious view of international relations before mentioned. Both of\r\nthese powers thus entered the war against France, but only as\r\nauxiliaries to the empress, not as principals; as nations, except the\r\ntroops actually in the field, they were considered to be still at\r\npeace. Such an equivocal situation could in the end have only one\r\nresult. On the sea France had already assumed the same position of\r\nauxiliary to Spain, in virtue of the defensive alliance between the\r\ntwo kingdoms, while affecting still to be at peace with England; and\r\nit is curious to see the gravity with which French writers complain of\r\nassaults upon French by English ships, upon the plea that there was no\r\nopen war between the two States. It has already been mentioned that in\r\n1740 a French squadron supported a division of Spanish ships on their\r\nway to America. In 1741, Spain, having now entered the continental war\r\nas an enemy of Austria, sent a body of fifteen thousand troops from\r\nBarcelona to attack the Austrian possessions in Italy. The English\r\nadmiral Haddock, in the Mediterranean, sought and found the Spanish\r\nfleet; but with it was a division of twelve French sail-of-the-line,\r\nwhose commander informed Haddock that he was engaged in the same\r\nexpedition and had orders to fight, if the Spaniards, though formally\r\nat war with England, were attacked. As the allies were nearly double\r\nhis force, the English admiral was obliged to go back to Port Mahon.\r\nHe was soon after relieved; and the new admiral, Matthews, held at\r\nonce the two positions of commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean and\r\nEnglish minister at Turin, the capital of the King of Sardinia. In the\r\ncourse of the year 1742 an English captain in his fleet, chasing some\r\nSpanish galleys, drove them into the French port of St. Tropez, and\r\nfollowing them into the harbor burned them, in spite of the so-called\r\nneutrality of France. In the same year Matthews sent a division of\r\nships under Commodore Martin to Naples, to compel the Bourbon king to\r\nwithdraw his contingent of twenty thousand troops serving with the\r\nSpanish army in northern Italy against the Austrians. To the attempts\r\nto negotiate, Martin replied only by pulling out his watch and giving\r\nthe government an hour to come to terms. There was nothing for it but\r\nsubmission; and the English fleet left the harbor after a stay of\r\ntwenty-four hours, having relieved the empress of a dangerous enemy.\r\nHenceforward it was evident that the Spanish war in Italy could only\r\nbe maintained by sending troops through France; England controlled the\r\nsea and the action of Naples. These two last incidents, at St. Tropez\r\nand Naples, deeply impressed the aged Fleuri, who recognized too late\r\nthe scope and importance of a well-founded sea power. Causes of\r\ncomplaint were multiplying on both sides, and the moment was fast\r\napproaching when both France and England must quit the pretence of\r\nbeing only auxiliaries in the war. Before it came to that, however,\r\nthe controlling sea power and wealth of England again made itself felt\r\nby attaching the King of Sardinia to the Austrian cause. Between the\r\ndangers and advantages of the French or English alliance the king's\r\naction was determined by a subsidy and the promise of a strong English\r\nfleet in the Mediterranean; in return he engaged to enter the war with\r\nan army of forty-five thousand men. This compact was signed in\r\nSeptember, 1743. In October, Fleuri being now dead, Louis XV. made\r\nwith Spain a treaty, by which he engaged to declare war against\r\nEngland and Sardinia, and to support the Spanish claims in Italy, as\r\nalso to Gibraltar, Mahon, and Georgia. Open war was thus near at hand,\r\nbut the declaration was still deferred. The greatest sea fight that\r\ntook place occurred while nominal peace yet existed.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. VII. MATTHEWS. FEB., 1744., Pl. VIIa. BYNG.\r\n   MAY, 1756.]\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1743 the Infante Philip of Spain had sought to\r\nland on the coast of the Genoese Republic, which was unfriendly to the\r\nAustrians; but the attempt had been frustrated by the English fleet,\r\nand the Spanish ships forced to retreat into Toulon. They lay there\r\nfor four months, unable to go out on account of the English\r\nsuperiority. In this dilemma the court of Spain applied to Louis XV.\r\nand obtained an order for the French fleet, under the command of\r\nAdmiral de Court,--an old man of eighty years, a veteran of the days\r\nof Louis XIV.,--to escort the Spaniards either to the Gulf of Genoa or\r\nto their own ports, it does not clearly appear which. The French\r\nadmiral was ordered not to fire unless he was attacked. In order to\r\nsecure the best co-operation of the Spaniards, whose efficiency he\r\nprobably distrusted, De Court proposed, as Ruyter had done in days\r\nlong gone by, to scatter their ships among his own; but as the Spanish\r\nadmiral, Navarro, refused, the line-of-battle was formed with nine\r\nFrench ships in the van, in the centre six French and three Spaniards,\r\nin the rear nine Spanish ships; in all, twenty-seven. In this order\r\nthe combined fleets sailed from Toulon February 19, 1744. The English\r\nfleet, which had been cruising off Hyères in observation, chased, and\r\non the 22d its van and centre came up with the allies; but the rear\r\ndivision was then several miles to windward and astern, quite out of\r\nsupporting distance (Plate VII., r). The wind was easterly, both\r\nfleets heading to the southward, and the English had the weather-gage.\r\nThe numbers were nearly equal, the English having twenty-nine to the\r\nallied twenty-seven; but this advantage was reversed by the failure of\r\nthe English rear to join. The course of the rear-admiral has been\r\ngenerally attributed to ill-will toward Matthews; for although he\r\nproved that in his separated position he made all sail to join, he did\r\nnot attack later on when he could, on the plea that the signal for the\r\nline-of-battle was flying at the same time as the signal to engage;\r\nmeaning that he could not leave the line to fight without disobeying\r\nthe order to form line. This technical excuse was, however, accepted\r\nby the subsequent court-martial. Under the actual conditions Matthews,\r\nmortified and harassed by the inaction of his lieutenant, and fearing\r\nthat the enemy would escape if he delayed longer, made the signal to\r\nengage when his own van was abreast the enemy's centre, and at once\r\nbore down himself out of the line and attacked with his flag-ship of\r\nninety guns the largest ship in the enemy's line, the \"Royal Philip,\"\r\nof one hundred and ten guns, carrying the flag of the Spanish admiral\r\n(a). In doing this he was bravely supported by his next ahead and\r\nastern. The moment of attack seems to have been judiciously chosen;\r\nfive Spanish ships had straggled far to the rear, leaving their\r\nadmiral with the support only of his next ahead and astern, while\r\nthree other Spaniards continued on with the French. The English van\r\nstood on, engaging the allied centre, while the allied van was without\r\nantagonists. Being thus disengaged, the latter was desirous of tacking\r\nto windward of the head of the English line, thus putting it between\r\ntwo fires, but was checked by the intelligent action of the three\r\nleading English captains, who, disregarding the signal to bear down,\r\nkept their commanding position and stopped the enemy's attempts to\r\ndouble. For this they were cashiered by the court-martial, but\r\nafterward restored. This circumspect but justifiable disregard of\r\nsignals was imitated without any justification by all the English\r\ncaptains of the centre, save the admiral's seconds already mentioned,\r\nas well as by some of those in the van, who kept up a cannonade at\r\nlong range while their commander-in-chief was closely and even\r\nfuriously engaged. The one marked exception was Captain Hawke,\r\nafterward the distinguished admiral, who imitated the example of his\r\nchief, and after driving his first antagonist out of action, quitted\r\nhis place in the van (b), brought to close quarters (b') a fine\r\nSpanish ship that had kept at bay five other English ships, and took\r\nher,--the only prize made that day. The commander of the English van,\r\nwith his seconds, also behaved with spirit and came to close action.\r\nIt is unnecessary to describe the battle further; as a military affair\r\nit deserves no attention, and its most important result was to bring\r\nout the merit of Hawke, whom the king and the government always\r\nremembered for his share in it. The general inefficiency and\r\nwide-spread misbehavior of the English captains, after five years of\r\ndeclared war, will partly explain the failure of England to obtain\r\nfrom her undoubted naval superiority the results she might have\r\nexpected in this war--the first act in a forty years' drama--and they\r\ngive military officers a lesson on the necessity of having their\r\nminds prepared and stocked, by study of the conditions of war in their\r\nown day, if they would not be found unready and perhaps disgraced in\r\nthe hour of battle.[89] It is not to be supposed that so many English\r\nseamen misbehaved through so vulgar and rare a defect as mere\r\ncowardice; it was unpreparedness of mind and lack of military\r\nefficiency in the captains, combined with bad leadership on the part\r\nof the admiral, with a possible taint of ill will toward him as a rude\r\nand domineering superior, that caused this fiasco. Attention may here\r\nfitly be drawn to the effect of a certain cordiality and good-will on\r\nthe part of superiors toward their subordinates. It is not perhaps\r\nessential to military success, but it undoubtedly contributes to the\r\nother elements of that success a spirit, a breath of life, which makes\r\npossible what would otherwise be impossible; which reaches heights of\r\ndevotion and achievement that the strictest discipline, not so\r\nenkindled, cannot attain. Doubtless it is a natural gift. The highest\r\nexample of it possibly ever known among seamen was Nelson. When he\r\njoined the fleet just before Trafalgar, the captains who gathered on\r\nboard the flag-ship seemed to forget the rank of their admiral in\r\ntheir desire to testify their joy at meeting him. \"This Nelson,\" wrote\r\nCaptain Duff, who fell in the battle, \"is so lovable and excellent a\r\nman, so kindly a leader, that we all wish to exceed his desires and\r\nanticipate his orders.\" He himself was conscious of this fascination\r\nand its value, when writing of the battle of the Nile to Lord Howe, he\r\nsaid, \"I had the happiness to command a band of brothers.\"\r\n\r\nThe celebrity attained by Matthews's action off Toulon, certainly not\r\ndue to the skill with which it was managed, nor to its results, sprang\r\nfrom the clamor at home, and chiefly from the number and findings of\r\nthe courts-martial that followed. Both the admiral and his second, and\r\nalso eleven captains out of the twenty-nine, had charges preferred\r\nagainst them. The admiral was cashiered because he had broken the\r\nline; that is, because his captains did not follow him when he left it\r\nto get at the enemy,--a decision that smacks more of the Irish bull\r\nthan of the Irish love of fighting. The second was acquitted on the\r\ntechnical grounds already given; he avoided the fault of breaking the\r\nline by keeping far enough away. Of the eleven captains one died, one\r\ndeserted, seven were dismissed or suspended, two only were acquitted.\r\nNor were the French and Spaniards better pleased; mutual\r\nrecriminations passed. Admiral de Court was relieved from his command,\r\nwhile the Spanish admiral was decorated by his government with the\r\ntitle of Marquis de la Victoria, a most extraordinary reward for what\r\nwas at best a drawn fight. The French, on the other hand, assert that\r\nhe left the deck on the plea of a very slight wound, and that the ship\r\nwas really fought by a French captain who happened to be on board.\r\n\r\nTo use a common expression, this battle, the first general action\r\nsince that off Malaga forty years before, \"woke up\" the English people\r\nand brought about a healthful reaction. The sifting process begun by\r\nthe battle itself was continued, but the result was reached too late\r\nto have its proper effect on the current war. It is rather by its\r\ndeficient action, than by such conspicuous successes as were attained\r\nin earlier and later times, that the general value of England's sea\r\npower is now shown; like some precious faculty, scarcely valued when\r\npossessed, but keenly missed when withdrawn. Mistress now of the seas\r\nrather by the weakness of her enemies than by her own disciplined\r\nstrength, she drew from that mastery no adequate results; the most\r\nsolid success, the capture of Cape Breton Island, in 1745, was\r\nachieved by the colonial forces of New England, to which indeed the\r\nroyal navy lent valuable aid, for to troops so situated the fleet is\r\nthe one line of communication. The misconduct off Toulon was repeated\r\nby officers high in command in the West and East Indies, resulting in\r\nthe latter case in the loss of Madras. Other causes concurred with the\r\neffete condition of the naval officers to hamper the action of that\r\nsea power which launches out far from home. The condition of England\r\nitself was insecure; the cause of the Stuarts was still alive, and\r\nthough a formidable invasion by fifteen thousand troops under Marshal\r\nSaxe, in 1744, was foiled, partly by the English Channel fleet, and\r\npartly by a storm which wrecked several of the transports assembled\r\noff Dunkirk, with the loss of many lives, yet the reality of the\r\ndanger was shown in the following year, when the Pretender landed in\r\nScotland with only a few men at his back and the northern kingdom rose\r\nwith him. His successful invasion was carried well down into England\r\nitself; and sober historians have thought that at one time the chances\r\nof ultimate success were rather with than against him. Another serious\r\nfetter upon the full use of England's power was the direction given to\r\nthe French operations on land and the mistaken means used to oppose\r\nthem. Neglecting Germany, France turned upon the Austrian Netherlands,\r\na country which England, out of regard to her sea interests, was not\r\nwilling to see conquered. Her commercial preponderance would be\r\ndirectly threatened by the passing of Antwerp, Ostend, and the Scheldt\r\ninto the hands of her great rival; and though her best check against\r\nthis would have been to seize valuable French possessions elsewhere\r\nand hold them as a pledge, the weakness of her government and the\r\npresent inefficiency of the navy prevented her doing so. The position\r\nof Hanover, again, controlled the action of England; for though united\r\nonly by the tie of a common sovereign, the love of that sovereign for\r\nhis continental dominion, his native country, made itself strongly\r\nfelt in the councils of a weak and time-serving ministry. It was the\r\ndisregard of Hanover by the first William Pitt, consequent upon his\r\nstrong English feeling, that incensed the king and led him so long to\r\nresist the demands of the nation that he should be put at the head of\r\naffairs. These different causes--dissension at home, interest in the\r\nNetherlands, regard for Hanover--combined to prevent a subservient and\r\nsecond-rate ministry, divided also among themselves, from giving a\r\nproper direction and infusing a proper spirit into the naval war; but\r\na better condition of the navy itself, more satisfactory results from\r\nit, might have modified even their action. As it was, the outcome of\r\nthe war was almost nothing as regards the disputes between England and\r\nher special enemies. On the continent, the questions after 1745\r\nreduced themselves to two,--what part of the Austrian possessions\r\nshould be given to Prussia, Spain, and Sardinia, and how peace was to\r\nbe wrenched by France from England and Holland. The sea countries\r\nstill, as of old, bore the expenses of the war, which however now fell\r\nchiefly upon England. Marshal Saxe, who commanded the French in\r\nFlanders throughout this war, summed up the situation in half a dozen\r\nwords to his king. \"Sire,\" said he, \"peace is within the walls of\r\nMaestricht.\" This strong city opened the course of the Meuse and the\r\nway for the French army into the United Provinces from the rear; for\r\nthe English fleet, in conjunction with that of Holland, prevented an\r\nattack from the sea. By the end of 1746, despite the efforts of the\r\nallies, nearly all Belgium was in the hands of the French; but up to\r\nthis time, although Dutch subsidies were supporting the Austrian\r\ngovernment, and Dutch troops in the Netherlands were fighting for it,\r\nthere was nominal peace between the United Provinces and France. In\r\nApril, 1747, \"the King of France invaded Dutch Flanders, announcing\r\nthat he was obliged to send his army into the territory of the\r\nrepublic, to arrest the protection granted by the States-General to\r\nthe Austrian and English troops; but that he had no intention of\r\nbreaking with it, and that the places and provinces occupied would be\r\nrestored to the United Provinces as soon as they gave proof that they\r\nhad ceased to succor the enemies of France.\" This was actual, but not\r\nformal, war. Numerous places fell during the year, and the successes\r\nof the French inclined both Holland and England to come to terms.\r\nNegotiations went on during the winter; but in April, 1748, Saxe\r\ninvested Maestricht. This forced a peace.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, though languishing, the sea war was not wholly uneventful.\r\nTwo encounters between English and French squadrons happened during the\r\nyear 1747, completing the destruction of the French fighting navy. In\r\nboth cases the English were decidedly superior; and though there was\r\ngiven opportunity for some brilliant fighting by particular captains,\r\nand for the display of heroic endurance on the part of the French,\r\ngreatly outnumbered but resisting to the last, only one tactical lesson\r\nis afforded. This lesson is, that when an enemy, either as the result\r\nof battle or from original inequality, is greatly inferior in force,\r\nobliged to fly without standing on the order of his flying, the regard\r\notherwise due to order must be in a measure at least dismissed, and a\r\ngeneral chase ordered. The mistake of Tourville in this respect after\r\nBeachy Head has already been noted. In the first of the cases now under\r\ndiscussion, the English Admiral Anson had fourteen ships against eight\r\nFrench, weaker individually as well as in total number; in the second,\r\nSir Edward Hawke had fourteen against nine, the latter being somewhat\r\nlarger, ship for ship, than the English. In both cases the signal was\r\nmade for a general chase, and the action which resulted was a _mêlée_.\r\nThere was no opportunity for anything else; the one thing necessary was\r\nto overtake the running enemy, and that can only certainly be done by\r\nletting the fleetest or best situated ships get ahead, sure that the\r\nspeed of the fastest pursuers is better than that of the slowest of\r\nthe pursued, and that therefore either the latter must be abandoned or\r\nthe whole force brought to bay. In the second case the French\r\ncommander, Commodore l'Étenduère, did not have to be followed far. He\r\nhad with him a convoy of two hundred and fifty merchant-ships;\r\ndetaching one ship-of-the-line to continue the voyage with the convoy,\r\nhe placed himself with the other eight between it and the enemy,\r\nawaiting the attack under his topsails. As the English came up one\r\nafter another they divided on either side of the French column, which\r\nwas thus engaged on both sides. After an obstinate resistance, six of\r\nthe French ships were taken, but the convoy was saved. The English had\r\nbeen so roughly handled that the two remaining French men-of-war got\r\nback safely to France. If, therefore, Sir Edward Hawke showed in his\r\nattack the judgment and dash which always distinguished that remarkable\r\nofficer, it may be claimed for Commodore l'Étenduère that fortune, in\r\nassigning him the glorious disadvantage of numbers, gave him also the\r\nleading part in the drama, and that he filled it nobly. A French\r\nofficer justly remarks that \"he defended his convoy as on shore a\r\nposition is defended, when the aim is to save an army corps or to\r\nassure an evolution; he gave himself to be crushed. After an action\r\nthat lasted from mid-day till eight P.M. the convoy was saved, thanks\r\nto the obstinacy of the defence; two hundred and fifty ships were saved\r\nto their owners by the devotion of L'Étenduère and of the captains\r\nunder his orders. This devotion cannot be questioned, for eight ships\r\nhad but few chances of surviving an action with fourteen; and not only\r\ndid the commander of the eight accept an action which he might possibly\r\nhave avoided, but he knew how to inspire his lieutenants with trust in\r\nhim; for all supported the strife with honor, and yielded at last,\r\nshowing the most indisputable proofs of their fine and energetic\r\ndefence. Four ships were entirely dismasted, two had only the foremast\r\nstanding.\"[90] The whole affair, as conducted on both sides, affords an\r\nadmirable study of how to follow up an advantage, original or\r\nacquired, and of the results that may be obtained by a gallant, even\r\nhopeless defence, for the furtherance of a particular object. It may be\r\nadded that Hawke, disabled from further pursuit himself, sent a sloop\r\nof war express to the West Indies, with information of the approach of\r\nthe convoy,--a step which led to the capture of part of it, and gives a\r\ntouch of completeness to the entire transaction, which cannot fail to\r\nbe gratifying to a military student interested in seeing the actors in\r\nhistory fully alive to and discharging to the utmost their important\r\ntasks.\r\n\r\nBefore bringing to a close the story of this war and mentioning the\r\npeace settlement, an account must be given of the transactions in\r\nIndia, where France and England were then on equal terms. It has been\r\nsaid that affairs there were controlled by the East India companies of\r\neither nation; and that the French were represented in the peninsula\r\nby Dupleix, in the islands by La Bourdonnais. The latter was appointed\r\nto his post in 1735, and his untiring genius had been felt in all the\r\ndetails of administration, but especially in converting the Isle of\r\nFrance into a great naval station,--a work which had to be built up\r\nfrom the foundations. Everything was wanting; everything was by him in\r\ngreater or less measure supplied,--storehouses, dock-yards,\r\nfortifications, seamen. In 1740, when war between France and England\r\nbecame probable, he obtained from the East India Company a squadron,\r\nthough smaller than he asked, with which he proposed to ruin the\r\nEnglish commerce and shipping; but when war actually began in 1744, he\r\nreceived orders not to attack the English, the French company hoping\r\nthat neutrality might exist between the companies in that distant\r\nregion, though the nations were at war. The proposition does not seem\r\nabsurd in view of the curious relations of Holland to France,\r\nnominally at peace while sending troops to the Austrian army; but it\r\nwas much to the advantage of the English, who were inferior in the\r\nIndian seas. Their company accepted the proffer, while saying that it\r\nof course could bind neither the home government nor the royal navy.\r\nThe advantage won by the forethought of La Bourdonnais was thus lost;\r\nthough first, and long alone, on the field, his hand was stayed.\r\nMeanwhile the English admiralty sent out a squadron and began to seize\r\nFrench ships between India and China; not till then did the company\r\nawake from its illusion. Having done this part of its work, the\r\nEnglish squadron sailed to the coast of India, and in July, 1745,\r\nappeared off Pondicherry, the political capital of French India,\r\nprepared to sustain an attack which the governor of Madras was about\r\nto make by land. La Bourdonnais' time was now come.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the mainland of the Indian peninsula, Dupleix had been\r\nforming wide views and laying broad foundations for the establishment\r\nof French preponderance. Having entered the service of their company\r\nat first in a subordinate clerical position, his ability had raised\r\nhim by rapid steps to be head of the commercial establishments at\r\nChandernagore, to which he gave a very great enlargement, seriously\r\naffecting, it is said even destroying, parts of the English trade. In\r\n1742 he was made governor-general, and as such removed to Pondicherry.\r\nHere he began to develop his policy, which aimed at bringing India\r\nunder the power of France. He saw that through the progress and\r\nextension of the European races over the seas of the whole world the\r\ntime had come when the Eastern peoples must be brought into\r\never-increasing contact with them; and he judged that India, so often\r\nconquered before, was now about to be conquered by Europeans. He meant\r\nthat France should win the prize, and saw in England the only rival.\r\nHis plan was to meddle in Indian politics: first, as head of a foreign\r\nand independent colony, which he already was; and second, as a vassal\r\nof the Great Mogul, which he intended to become. To divide and\r\nconquer, to advance the French lines and influence by judicious\r\nalliances, to turn wavering scales by throwing in on one side or the\r\nother the weight of French courage and skill,--such were his aims.\r\nPondicherry, though a poor harbor, was well adapted for his political\r\nplans; being far distant from Delhi, the capital of the Mogul,\r\naggressive extension might go on unmarked, until strong enough to\r\nbear the light. Dupleix's present aim, therefore, was to build up a\r\ngreat French principality in southeast India, around Pondicherry,\r\nwhile maintaining the present positions in Bengal.\r\n\r\nLet it be noted, however,--and the remark is necessary in order to\r\njustify the narration of these plans in connection with our subject, a\r\nconnection perhaps not at first evident,--that the kernel of the\r\nquestion now before Dupleix was not how to build up an empire out of\r\nthe Indian provinces and races, but how to get rid of the English, and\r\nthat finally. The wildest dreams of sovereignty he may have\r\nentertained could not have surpassed the actual performance of England\r\na few years later. European qualities were bound to tell, if not\r\noffset by the opposition of other Europeans; and such opposition on\r\nthe one side or the other depended upon the control of the sea. In a\r\nclimate so deadly to the white races the small numbers whose heroism\r\nbore up the war against fearful odds on many a field must be\r\ncontinually renewed. As everywhere and always, the action of sea power\r\nwas here quiet and unperceived; but it will not be necessary to\r\nbelittle in the least the qualities and career of Clive the English\r\nhero of this time and the founder of their empire, in order to prove\r\nthe decisive influence which it exerted, despite the inefficiency of\r\nthe English naval officers first engaged, and the lack of conclusive\r\nresults in such naval battles as were fought.[91] If during the twenty\r\nyears following 1743, French fleets instead of English had controlled\r\nthe coasts of the peninsula and the seas between it and Europe, can it\r\nbe believed that the schemes of Dupleix would have utterly failed?\r\n\"Naval inferiority,\" justly says a French historian, \"was the\r\nprincipal cause that arrested the progress of Dupleix. The French\r\nroyal navy did not make its appearance in the East Indies\" in his day.\r\nIt remains to tell the story briefly.\r\n\r\nThe English, in 1745, made preparations to besiege Pondicherry, in\r\nwhich the royal navy was to support the land forces; but the effects\r\nof Dupleix's political schemes were at once seen. The Nabob of the\r\nCarnatic threatened to attack Madras, and the English desisted. The\r\nfollowing year La Bourdonnais appeared on the scene, and an action\r\ntook place between his squadron and that under Commodore Peyton; after\r\nwhich, although it had been a drawn fight, the English officer\r\ndeserted the coast, taking refuge in Ceylon, and leaving the control\r\nat sea with the French. La Bourdonnais anchored at Pondicherry, where\r\nquarrels between him and Dupleix soon arose, and were aggravated by\r\nthe conflicting tone of their instructions from home. In September he\r\nwent to Madras, attacked by land and sea, and took the place, but made\r\nwith the governor the stipulation that it might be ransomed; and a\r\nransom of two million dollars was accordingly paid. When Dupleix heard\r\nof this he was very angry, and claimed to annul the terms of\r\ncapitulation on the ground that, once taken, the place was within his\r\njurisdiction. La Bourdonnais resented this attempt as dishonorable to\r\nhim after the promise given. While the quarrel was going on, a violent\r\ncyclone wrecked two of his ships and dismasted the rest. He soon after\r\nreturned to France, where his activity and zeal were repaid by three\r\nyears' imprisonment under charges, from the effects of which treatment\r\nhe died. After his departure Dupleix broke the capitulation, seized\r\nand kept Madras, drove out the English settlers, and went on to\r\nstrengthen the fortifications. From Madras he turned against Fort St.\r\nDavid, but the approach of an English squadron compelled him to raise\r\nthe siege in March, 1747.\r\n\r\nDuring this year the disasters to the French navy in the Atlantic,\r\nalready related, left the English undisturbed masters of the sea. In\r\nthe following winter they sent to India the greatest European fleet\r\nyet seen in the East, with a large land force, the whole under the\r\ncommand of Admiral Boscawen, who bore a general's commission in\r\naddition to his naval rank. The fleet appeared off the Coromandel\r\ncoast in August, 1748. Pondicherry was attacked by land and sea, but\r\nDupleix made a successful resistance. The English fleet in its turn\r\nsuffered from a hurricane, and the siege was raised in October.\r\nShortly after came the news of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, which\r\nended the European war. Dupleix, with his home communications\r\nrestored, could now resume his subtle and persevering efforts to\r\nsecure a territorial base which should, as far as possible, shelter\r\nhim from the chances of sea war. Pity that so much genius and patience\r\nshould have been spent in an effort wholly vain; nothing could protect\r\nagainst that sea attack but a naval aid, which the home government\r\ncould not give. One of the conditions of the peace was that Madras\r\nshould be restored to the English in exchange for Louisburg, the prize\r\nwon by the North American colonists and released by them as\r\nreluctantly as Madras was by Dupleix. This was indeed illustrating\r\nNapoleon's boast that he would reconquer Pondicherry on the bank of\r\nthe Vistula; yet, although the maritime supremacy of England made\r\nLouisburg in her hands much stronger than Madras, or any other\r\nposition in India, when held by the French, the gain by the exchange\r\nwas decidedly on the side of Great Britain. The English colonists were\r\nnot men to be contented with this action; but they knew the naval\r\npower of England, and that they could do again what they had done\r\nonce, at a point not far distant from their own shores. They\r\nunderstood the state of the case. Not so with Madras. How profound\r\nmust have been the surprise of the native princes at this surrender,\r\nhow injurious to the personality of Dupleix and the influence he had\r\ngained among them, to see him, in the very hour of victory, forced, by\r\na power they could not understand, to relinquish his spoil! They were\r\nquite right; the mysterious power which they recognized by its\r\nworking, though they saw it not, was not in this or that man, king or\r\nstatesman, but in that control of the sea which the French government\r\nknew forbade the hope of maintaining that distant dependency against\r\nthe fleets of England. Dupleix himself saw it not; for some years more\r\nhe continued building, on the sand of Oriental intrigues and lies, a\r\nhouse which he vainly hoped would stand against the storms that must\r\ndescend upon it.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, ending this general war, was signed\r\nApril 30, 1748, by England, France, and Holland, and finally by all\r\nthe powers in October of the same year. With the exception of certain\r\nportions shorn off the Austrian Empire,--Silesia for Prussia, Parma\r\nfor the Infante Philip of Spain, and some Italian territory to the\r\neast of Piedmont for the King of Sardinia,--the general tenor of the\r\nterms was a return to the status before the war. \"Never, perhaps, did\r\nany war, after so many great events, and so large a loss of blood and\r\ntreasure, end in replacing the nations engaged in it so nearly in the\r\nsame situation as they held at first.\" In truth, as regarded France,\r\nEngland, and Spain, the affair of the Austrian succession, supervening\r\nso soon upon the outbreak of war between the two latter, had wholly\r\nturned hostilities aside from their true direction and postponed for\r\nfifteen years the settlement of disputes which concerned them much\r\nmore nearly than the accession of Maria Theresa. In the distress of\r\nher old enemy, the House of Austria, France was easily led to renew\r\nher attacks upon it, and England as easily drawn to oppose the\r\nattempts of the French to influence or dictate in German affairs,--a\r\ncourse the more readily followed from the German interests of the\r\nking. It may be questioned whether the true policy for France was to\r\ndirect the war upon the heart of the Austrian Empire, by way of the\r\nRhine and Germany, or, as she finally did, upon the remote possessions\r\nof the Netherlands. In the former case she rested on friendly\r\nterritory in Bavaria, and gave a hand to Prussia, whose military\r\npower was now first felt. Such was the first theatre of the war. On\r\nthe other hand, in the Netherlands, whither the chief scene of\r\nhostilities shifted later, France struck not only at Austria, but also\r\nat the sea powers, always jealous of her intrusion there. They were\r\nthe soul of the war against her, by their subsidies to her other\r\nenemies and by the losses inflicted on her commerce and that of Spain.\r\nThe misery of France was alleged to the King of Spain by Louis XV., as\r\nforcing him to conclude peace; and it is evident that the suffering\r\nmust have been great to induce him to yield such easy terms as he did,\r\nwhen he already held the Netherlands and parts of Holland itself by\r\nforce of arms. But while so successful on the continent, his navy was\r\nannihilated and communication with the colonies thus cut off; and\r\nthough it may be doubted whether the French government of that day\r\ncherished the colonial ambitions ascribed to it by some, it is certain\r\nFrench commerce was suffering enormously.\r\n\r\nWhile this was the condition of France, impelling her to peace,\r\nEngland in 1747 found that, from disputes about trade in Spanish\r\nAmerica and through the inefficient action of her navy, she had been\r\nled away into a continental war, in which she had met with disaster,\r\nincurred nearly £80,000,000 of debt, and now saw her ally Holland\r\nthreatened with invasion. The peace itself was signed under a threat\r\nby the French envoy that the slightest delay would be the signal for\r\nthe French to destroy the fortifications of the captured towns and at\r\nonce begin the invasion. At the same time her own resources were\r\ndrained, and Holland, exhausted, was seeking to borrow from her.\r\n\"Money,\" we are told, \"was never so scarce in the city, and cannot be\r\nhad at twelve per cent.\" Had France, therefore, at this time had a\r\nnavy able to make head against that of England, even though somewhat\r\ninferior in strength, she might, with her grip on the Netherlands and\r\nMaestricht, have exacted her own conditions. England, on the other\r\nhand, though driven to the wall on the continent, was nevertheless\r\nable to obtain peace on equal terms, through the control of the sea by\r\nher navy.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of all three nations had suffered enormously, but the\r\nbalance of prizes in favor of Great Britain was estimated at\r\n£2,000,000. Stated in another way, it is said that the combined losses\r\nof French and Spanish commerce amounted during the war to 3,434 ships,\r\nthe English to 3,238; but in considering such figures, the relation\r\nthey bear to the total merchant shipping of either nation must not be\r\nforgotten. A thousand vessels were a very much larger fraction of\r\nFrench shipping than of English, and meant more grievous loss.\r\n\r\n    \"After the disaster to the squadron of L'Étenduère,\" says a\r\n    French writer, \"the French flag did not appear at sea.\r\n    Twenty-two ships-of-the-line composed the navy of France, which\r\n    sixty years before had one hundred and twenty. Privateers made\r\n    few prizes; followed everywhere, unprotected, they almost always\r\n    fell a prey to the English. The British naval forces, without\r\n    any rivals, passed unmolested over the seas. In one year they\r\n    are said to have taken from French commerce £7,000,000 sterling.\r\n    Yet this sea power, which might have seized French and Spanish\r\n    colonies, made few conquests from want of unity and persistence\r\n    in the direction given them.\"[92]\r\n\r\nTo sum up, France was forced to give up her conquests for want of a\r\nnavy, and England saved her position by her sea power, though she had\r\nfailed to use it to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88] Martin: History of France\r\n\r\n[89] There is not in modern naval history a more striking warning to\r\nthe officers of every era, than this battle of Toulon. Coming as it\r\ndid after a generation of comparative naval inactivity, it tried men's\r\nreputation as by fire. The lesson, in the judgment of the author, is\r\nthe danger of disgraceful failure to men who have neglected to keep\r\nthemselves prepared, not only in knowledge of their profession, but in\r\nthe sentiment of what war requires. The average man is not a coward;\r\nbut neither is he endowed by nature only with the rare faculty of\r\nseizing intuitively the proper course at a critical moment. He gains\r\nit, some more, some less, by experience or by reflection. If both have\r\nbeen lacking to him, indecision will follow; either from not knowing\r\nwhat to do, or from failure to realize that utter self-devotion of\r\nhimself and his command are required. Of one of the captains cashiered\r\nit is said: \"No man had ever lived with a fairer or more honorable\r\ncharacter previous to the unfortunate event which did such irreparable\r\ninjury to his reputation. Many of his contemporaries, men in the\r\nhighest popular estimation, who knew him well, could scarcely credit\r\nwhat were indisputably established as facts, and declared, with the\r\nutmost astonishment, 'they believed it next to impossible for Captain\r\nBurrish to behave otherwise than as a man of gallantry and\r\nintrepidity.'\" He had been twenty-five years in service, and eleven\r\nafloat as a captain (Charnock's Biographia Navalis). Others of the\r\ncondemned men bore fair characters; and even Richard Norris, who\r\nabsconded to avoid trial, had been of respectable repute.\r\n\r\n[90] Troude: Batailles Navales de la France\r\n\r\n[91] \"Notwithstanding the extraordinary effort made by the French in\r\nsending out M. Lally with a considerable force last year, I am\r\nconfident before the end of this [1759] they will be near their last\r\ngasp in the Carnatic unless some very unforeseen event interpose in\r\ntheir favor. The _superiority of our squadron_ and the plenty of money\r\nand supplies of all kinds which our friends on that coast will be\r\nfurnished with from this province [Bengal], while the enemy are in\r\ntotal want of everything, without any visible means of redress, are\r\nsuch advantages as, if properly attended to, cannot fail of wholly\r\neffecting their ruin in that as well as in every other part of India\"\r\n(Letter of Clive to Pitt, Calcutta, January 7, 1759; Gleig's Life of\r\nLord Clive). It will be remembered that the control and use of Bengal,\r\nupon which Clive here counts, had only lately been acquired by the\r\nEnglish; in the days of Dupleix they did not possess them. As will be\r\nseen later, Clive's predictions in this letter were wholly fulfilled.\r\n\r\n[92] Lapeyrouse-Bonfils: Hist. de la Marine Française.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    SEVEN YEARS' WAR, 1756-1763.--ENGLAND'S OVERWHELMING POWER AND\r\n    CONQUESTS ON THE SEAS, IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AND EAST AND\r\n    WEST INDIES.--SEA BATTLES: BYNG OFF MINORCA; HAWKE AND CONFLANS;\r\n    POCOCK AND D'ACHÉ IN EAST INDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe urgency with which peace was desired by the principal parties to\r\nthe War of the Austrian Succession may perhaps be inferred from the\r\nneglect to settle definitely and conclusively many of the questions\r\noutstanding between them, and notably the very disputes about which\r\nthe war between England and Spain began. It seems as though the powers\r\nfeared to treat thoroughly matters that contained the germs of future\r\nquarrels, lest the discussion should prolong the war that then\r\nexisted. England made peace because the fall of Holland was otherwise\r\ninevitable, not because she had enforced, or surrendered, her claims\r\nof 1739 against Spain. The right of uninterrupted navigation in West\r\nIndian seas, free from any search, was left undetermined, as were\r\nother kindred matters. Not only so, but the boundaries between the\r\nEnglish and French colonies in the valley of the Ohio, toward Canada,\r\nand on the land side of the Nova Scotian peninsula, remained as vague\r\nas they had before been. It was plain that peace could not last; and\r\nby it, if she had saved Holland, England surrendered the control of\r\nthe sea which she had won. The true character of the strife, shrouded\r\nfor a moment by the continental war, was revealed by the so-called\r\npeace; though formally allayed, the contention continued in every part\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nIn India, Dupleix, no longer able to attack the English openly, sought\r\nto undermine their power by the line of policy already described.\r\nMingling adroitly in the quarrels of surrounding princes, and\r\nadvancing his own power while so doing, he attained by rapid steps to\r\nthe political control, in 1751, of the southern extremity of India,--a\r\ncountry nearly as large as France. Given the title of Nabob, he now\r\nhad a place among the princes of the land. \"A merely commercial policy\r\nwas in his eyes a delusion; there could be no middle course between\r\nconquest and abandonment.\" In the course of the same year further\r\ngrants extended the French power through extensive regions to the\r\nnorth and east, embracing all the coast of Orissa, and made Dupleix\r\nruler of a third of India. To celebrate his triumphs, perhaps also in\r\naccordance with his policy of impressing the native mind, he now\r\nfounded a town and put up a pillar setting forth his successes. But\r\nhis doings caused the directors of the company only disquietude;\r\ninstead of the reinforcements he asked for they sent him exhortations\r\nto peace; and at about this time Robert Clive, then but twenty-six\r\nyears old, began to show his genius. The success of Dupleix and his\r\nallies became checkered with reverses; the English under Clive's\r\nleadership supported the native opponents of the French. The company\r\nat home was but little interested in his political schemes, and was\r\nannoyed at the failure of dividends. Negotiations were opened at\r\nLondon for a settlement of difficulties, and Dupleix was summoned\r\nhome; the English government, it is said, making his recall an\r\nabsolute condition of continued peace. Two days after his departure,\r\nin 1754, his successor signed a treaty with the English governor,\r\nwholly abandoning his policy, stipulating that neither company should\r\ninterfere in the internal politics of India, and that all possessions\r\nacquired during the war in the Carnatic should be given back to the\r\nMogul. What France thus surrendered was in extent and population an\r\nempire, and the mortification of French historians has branded the\r\nconcession as ignominious; but how could the country have been held,\r\nwith the English navy cutting off the eagerly desired reinforcements?\r\n\r\nIn North America, the declaration of peace was followed by renewed\r\nagitation, which sprang from and betokened the deep feeling and keen\r\nsense of the situation had by the colonists and local authorities on\r\neither side. The Americans held to their points with the stubbornness\r\nof their race. \"There is no repose for our thirteen colonies,\" wrote\r\nFranklin, \"so long as the French are masters of Canada.\" The rival\r\nclaims to the central unsettled region, which may accurately enough be\r\ncalled the valley of the Ohio, involved, if the English were\r\nsuccessful, the military separation of Canada from Louisiana; while on\r\nthe other hand, occupation by the French, linking the two extremes of\r\ntheir acknowledged possessions, would shut up the English colonists\r\nbetween the Alleghany Mountains and the sea. The issues were apparent\r\nenough to leading Americans of that day, though they were more\r\nfar-reaching than the wisest of them could have foreseen; there is\r\nroom for curious speculation as to the effect, not only upon America,\r\nbut upon the whole world, if the French government had had the will,\r\nand the French people the genius, effectively to settle and hold the\r\nnorthern and western regions which they then claimed. But while\r\nFrenchmen upon the spot saw clearly enough the coming contest and the\r\nterrible disadvantage of unequal numbers and inferior navy under which\r\nCanada must labor, the home government was blind alike to the value of\r\nthe colony and to the fact that it must be fought for; while the\r\ncharacter and habits of the French settlers, lacking in political\r\nactivity and unused to begin and carry through measures for the\r\nprotection of their own interests, did not remedy the neglect of the\r\nmother-country. The paternal centralizing system of French rule had\r\ntaught the colonists to look to the mother-country, and then failed to\r\ntake care of them. The governors of Canada of that day acted as\r\ncareful and able military men, doing what they could to supply defects\r\nand weaknesses; it is possible that their action was more consistent\r\nand well-planned than that of the English governors; but with the\r\ncarelessness of both home governments, nothing in the end could take\r\nthe place of the capacity of the English colonists to look out for\r\nthemselves. It is odd and amusing to read the conflicting statements\r\nof English and French historians as to the purposes and aims of the\r\nopposing statesmen in these years when the first murmurings of the\r\nstorm were heard; the simple truth seems to be that one of those\r\nconflicts familiarly known to us as irrepressible was at hand, and\r\nthat both governments would gladly have avoided it. The boundaries\r\nmight be undetermined; the English colonists were not.\r\n\r\nThe French governors established posts where they could on the\r\ndebatable ground, and it was in the course of a dispute over one of\r\nthese, in 1754, that the name of Washington first appears in history.\r\nOther troubles occurred in Nova Scotia, and both home governments then\r\nbegan to awake. In 1755 Braddock's disastrous expedition was directed\r\nagainst Fort Duquesne, now Pittsburg, where Washington had surrendered\r\nthe year before. Later in the year another collision between the\r\nEnglish and French colonists happened near Lake George. Although\r\nBraddock's expedition had been first to start, the French government\r\nwas also moving. In May of the same year a large squadron of\r\nships-of-war, mostly armed _en flûte_[93], sailed from Brest with\r\nthree thousand troops, and a new governor, De Vaudreuil, for Canada.\r\nAdmiral Boscawen had already preceded this fleet, and lay in wait for\r\nit off the mouth of the St. Lawrence. There was as yet no open war,\r\nand the French were certainly within their rights in sending a\r\ngarrison to their own colonies; but Boscawen's orders were to stop\r\nthem. A fog which scattered the French squadron also covered its\r\npassage; but two of the ships were seen by the English fleet and\r\ncaptured, June 8, 1755. As soon as this news reached Europe, the\r\nFrench ambassador to London was recalled, but still no declaration of\r\nwar followed. In July, Sir Edward Hawke was sent to sea with orders to\r\ncruise between Ushant and Cape Finisterre, and to seize any French\r\nships-of-the-line he might see; to which were added in August further\r\norders to take all French ships of every kind, men-of-war, privateers,\r\nand merchantmen, and to send them into English ports. Before the end\r\nof the year, three hundred trading vessels, valued at six million\r\ndollars, had been captured, and six thousand French seamen were\r\nimprisoned in England,--enough to man nearly ten ships-of-the-line.\r\nAll this was done while nominal peace still existed. War was not\r\ndeclared until six months later.\r\n\r\nFrance still seemed to submit, but she was biding her time, and\r\npreparing warily a severe stroke for which she had now ample\r\nprovocation. Small squadrons, or detachments of ships, continued to be\r\nsent to the West Indies and to Canada, while noisy preparations were\r\nmade in the dock-yard of Brest, and troops assembled upon the shores\r\nof the Channel. England saw herself threatened with invasion,--a\r\nmenace to which her people have been peculiarly susceptible. The\r\ngovernment of the day, weak at best, was singularly unfit for waging\r\nwar, and easily misled as to the real danger. Besides, England was\r\nembarrassed, as always at the beginning of a war, not only by the\r\nnumerous points she had to protect in addition to her commerce, but\r\nalso by the absence of a large number of her seamen in trading-vessels\r\nall over the world. The Mediterranean was therefore neglected; and the\r\nFrench, while making loud demonstrations on the Channel, quietly\r\nequipped at Toulon twelve ships-of-the-line, which sailed on the 10th\r\nof April, 1756, under Admiral la Galissonière, convoying one hundred\r\nand fifty transports with fifteen thousand troops, commanded by the\r\nDuke of Richelieu. A week later the army was safely landed in Minorca,\r\nand Port Mahon invested, while the fleet established itself in\r\nblockade before the harbor.\r\n\r\nPractically this was a complete surprise; for though the suspicions of\r\nthe English government had been at last aroused, its action came too\r\nlate. The garrison had not been reinforced, and numbered a scant three\r\nthousand men, from which thirty-five officers were absent on leave,\r\namong them the governor and the colonels of all the regiments.\r\nAdmiral Byng sailed from Portsmouth with ten ships-of-the-line only\r\nthree days before the French left Toulon. Six weeks later, when he\r\nreached the neighborhood of Port Mahon, his fleet had been increased\r\nto thirteen ships-of-the-line, and he had with him four thousand\r\ntroops. It was already late; a practicable breach had been made in the\r\nfortress a week before. When the English fleet came in sight, La\r\nGalissonière stood out to meet it and bar the entrance to the harbor.\r\n\r\nThe battle that followed owes its historical celebrity wholly to the\r\nsingular and tragic event which arose from it. Unlike Matthews's\r\nbattle off Toulon, it does afford some tactical instruction, though\r\nmainly applicable to the obsolete conditions of warfare under sail;\r\nbut it is especially linked to the earlier action through the effect\r\nproduced upon the mind of the unfortunate Byng by the sentence of the\r\ncourt-martial upon Matthews. During the course of the engagement he\r\nrepeatedly alluded to the censure upon that admiral for leaving the\r\nline, and seems to have accepted the judgment as justifying, if not\r\ndetermining, his own course. Briefly, it may be said that the two\r\nfleets, having sighted each other on the morning of the 20th of May,\r\nwere found after a series of manoeuvres both on the port tack, with an\r\neasterly wind, heading southerly, the French to leeward, between the\r\nEnglish and the harbor. Byng ran down in line ahead off the wind, the\r\nFrench remaining by it, so that when the former made the signal to\r\nengage, the fleets were not parallel, but formed an angle of from\r\nthirty to forty degrees (Plate VIIa. A, A). The attack which Byng by\r\nhis own account meant to make, each ship against its opposite in the\r\nenemy's line, difficult to carry out under any circumstances, was here\r\nfurther impeded by the distance between the two rears being much\r\ngreater than that between the vans; so that his whole line could not\r\ncome into action at the same moment. When the signal was made, the van\r\nships kept away in obedience to it, and ran down for the French so\r\nnearly head-on (B, B) as to sacrifice their artillery fire in great\r\nmeasure; they received three raking broadsides, and were seriously\r\ndismantled aloft. The sixth English ship, counting from the van, had\r\nher foretopmast shot away, flew up into the wind, and came aback,\r\nstopping and doubling up the rear of the line. Then undoubtedly was\r\nthe time for Byng, having committed himself to the fight, to have set\r\nthe example and borne down, just as Farragut did at Mobile when his\r\nline was confused by the stopping of the next ahead; but according to\r\nthe testimony of the flag-captain, Matthews's sentence deterred him.\r\n\"You see, Captain Gardiner, that the signal for the line is out, and\r\nthat I am ahead of the ships 'Louisa' and 'Trident' [which in the\r\norder should have been ahead of him]. You would not have me, as the\r\nadmiral of the fleet, run down as if I were going to engage a single\r\nship. It was Mr. Matthews's misfortune to be prejudiced by not\r\ncarrying down his force together, which I shall endeavor to avoid.\"\r\nThe affair thus became entirely indecisive; the English van was\r\nseparated from the rear and got the brunt of the fight (C). One French\r\nauthority blames Galissonière for not tacking to windward of the\r\nenemy's van and crushing it. Another says he ordered the movement, but\r\nthat it could not be made from the damage to the rigging; but this\r\nseems improbable, as the only injury the French squadron underwent\r\naloft was the loss of one topsail yard, whereas the English suffered\r\nvery badly. The true reason is probably that given and approved by one\r\nof the French authorities on naval warfare. Galissonière considered\r\nthe support of the land attack on Mahon paramount to any destruction\r\nof the English fleet, if he thereby exposed his own. \"The French navy\r\nhas always preferred the glory of assuring or preserving a conquest to\r\nthat more brilliant perhaps, but actually less real, of taking some\r\nships, and therein has approached more nearly the true end that has\r\nbeen proposed in war.\"[94] The justice of this conclusion depends upon\r\nthe view that is taken of the true end of naval war. If it is merely\r\nto assure one or more positions ashore, the navy becomes simply a\r\nbranch of the army for a particular occasion, and subordinates its\r\naction accordingly; but if the true end is to preponderate over the\r\nenemy's navy and so control the sea, then the enemy's ships and fleets\r\nare the true objects to be assailed on all occasions. A glimmer of\r\nthis view seems to have been present to Morogues when he wrote that at\r\nsea there is no field of battle to be held, nor places to be won. If\r\nnaval warfare is a war of posts, then the action of the fleets must be\r\nsubordinate to the attack and defence of the posts; if its object is\r\nto break up the enemy's power on the sea, cutting off his\r\ncommunications with the rest of his possessions, drying up the sources\r\nof his wealth in his commerce, and making possible a closure of his\r\nports, then the object of attack must be his organized military forces\r\nafloat; in short, his navy. It is to the latter course, for whatever\r\nreason adopted, that England owed a control of the sea that forced the\r\nrestitution of Minorca at the end of this war. It is to the former\r\nthat France owed the lack of prestige in her navy. Take this very case\r\nof Minorca; had Galissonière been beaten, Richelieu and his fifteen\r\nthousand troops must have been lost to France, cooped up in Minorca,\r\nas the Spaniards, in 1718, were confined to Sicily. The French navy\r\ntherefore assured the capture of the island; but so slight was the\r\nimpression on the ministry and the public, that a French naval officer\r\ntells us: \"Incredible as it may seem, the minister of marine, after\r\nthe glorious affair off Mahon, instead of yielding to the zeal of an\r\nenlightened patriotism and profiting by the impulse which this victory\r\ngave to France to build up the navy, saw fit to sell the ships and\r\nrigging which we still had in our ports. We shall soon see the\r\ndeplorable consequences of this cowardly conduct on the part of our\r\nstatesmen.\"[95] Neither the glory nor the victory is very apparent;\r\nbut it is quite conceivable that had the French admiral thought less\r\nof Mahon and used the great advantage luck had given him to take, or\r\nsink, four or five of the enemy, the French people would have\r\nanticipated the outbreak of naval enthusiasm which appeared too late,\r\nin 1760. During the remainder of this war the French fleets, except\r\nin the East Indies, appear only as the pursued in a general chase.\r\n\r\nThe action imposed upon the French fleets was, however, consistent\r\nwith the general policy of the French government; and John Clerk was\r\nprobably right in saying that there is apparent in this action off\r\nMinorca a tactics too well defined to be merely accidental,--a tactics\r\nessentially defensive in its scope and aim.[96] In assuming the\r\nlee-gage the French admiral not only covered Mahon, but took a good\r\ndefensive position, imposing upon his enemy the necessity of attacking\r\nwith all the consequent risks. Clerk seems to bring evidence enough to\r\nprove that the leading French ships did, after roughly handling their\r\nassailants, astutely withdraw (C) thus forcing the latter to attack\r\nagain with like results. The same policy was repeatedly followed\r\nduring the American war twenty years later, and with pretty uniform\r\nsuccess; so much so that, although formal avowal of the policy is\r\nwanting, it may be concluded that circumspection, economy, defensive\r\nwar, remained the fixed purpose of the French authorities, based\r\ndoubtless upon the reasons given by Admiral Grivel, of that navy:--\r\n\r\n    \"If two maritime powers are at strife, the one that has the\r\n    fewest ships must always avoid doubtful engagements; it must run\r\n    only those risks necessary for carrying out its missions, avoid\r\n    action by manoeuvring, or at worst, if forced to engage, assure\r\n    itself of favorable conditions. The attitude to be taken should\r\n    depend radically upon the power of your opponent. Let us not\r\n    tire of repeating, according as she has to do with an inferior\r\n    or superior power, France has before her two distinct\r\n    strategies, radically opposite both in means and ends,--Grand\r\n    War and Cruising War.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a formal utterance by an officer of rank must be received with\r\nrespect, and the more so when it expresses a consistent policy\r\nfollowed by a great and warlike nation; yet it may be questioned\r\nwhether a sea power worthy of the name can thus be secured. Logically,\r\nit follows from the position assumed, that combats between equal\r\nforces are to be discouraged, because the loss to you is greater than\r\nthe loss to your opponent. \"In fact,\" says Ramatuelle, upholding the\r\nFrench policy, \"of what consequence to the English would be the loss\r\nof a few ships?\" But the next inevitable step in the argument is that\r\nit is better not to meet the enemy. As another Frenchman,[97]\r\npreviously quoted, says, it was considered a mishap to their ships to\r\nfall in with a hostile force, and, if one was met, their duty was to\r\navoid action if possible to do so honorably. They had ulterior objects\r\nof more importance than fighting the enemy's navy. Such a course\r\ncannot be consistently followed for years without affecting the spirit\r\nand tone of the officers charged with it; and it led directly to as\r\nbrave a man as ever commanded a fleet, the Comte de Grasse, failing to\r\ncrush the English under Rodney when he had the chance, in 1782. On the\r\n9th of April of that year, being chased by the English among the\r\nWindward Islands, it happened to him to have sixteen of their fleet\r\nunder his lee while the main body was becalmed under Dominica. Though\r\ngreatly superior to the separated ships, during the three hours that\r\nthis state of things lasted, De Grasse left them undisturbed, except\r\nby a distant cannonade by his own van; and his action was justified by\r\nthe court which tried him, in which were many officers of high rank\r\nand doubtless of distinction, as being \"an act of prudence on the part\r\nof the admiral, dictated to him by the ulterior projects of the\r\ncruise.\" Three days later he was signally beaten by the fleet he had\r\nfailed to attack at disadvantage, and all the ulterior projects of the\r\ncruise went down with him.\r\n\r\nTo return to Minorca; after the action of the 20th, Byng called a\r\ncouncil of war, which decided that nothing more could be done, and\r\nthat the English fleet should go to Gibraltar and cover that place\r\nfrom an attack. At Gibraltar, Byng was relieved by Hawke and sent home\r\nto be tried. The court-martial, while expressly clearing him of\r\ncowardice or disaffection, found him guilty of not doing his utmost\r\neither to defeat the French fleet or to relieve the garrison at\r\nMahon; and, as the article of war prescribed death with no\r\nalternative punishment for this offence, it felt compelled to sentence\r\nhim to death. The king refused to pardon, and Byng was accordingly\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nThe expedition against Minorca was begun while nominal peace still\r\nlasted. On the 17th of May, three days before Byng's battle, England\r\ndeclared war, and France replied on the 20th of June. On the 28th,\r\nPort Mahon surrendered, and Minorca passed into the hands of France.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the troubles between the two nations, and the scenes\r\nwhere they occurred, pointed out clearly enough the proper theatre of\r\nthe strife, and we should by rights now be at the opening of a sea\r\nwar, illustrated by great naval actions and attended with great\r\nmodifications in the colonial and foreign possessions of the two\r\npowers. Of the two, England alone recognized the truth; France was\r\nagain turned aside from the sea by causes which will shortly be given.\r\nHer fleets scarcely appeared; and losing the control of the sea, she\r\nsurrendered one by one her colonies and all her hopes in India. Later\r\nin the struggle she drew in Spain as her ally, but it was only to\r\ninvolve that country in her own external ruin. England, on the other\r\nhand, defended and nourished by the sea, rode it everywhere in\r\ntriumph. Secure and prosperous at home, she supported with her money\r\nthe enemies of France. At the end of seven years the kingdom of Great\r\nBritain had become the British Empire.\r\n\r\nIt is far from certain that France could have successfully contended\r\nwith England on the sea, without an ally. In 1756 the French navy had\r\nsixty-three ships-of-the-line, of which forty-five were in fair\r\ncondition; but equipments and artillery were deficient. Spain had\r\nforty-six ships-of-the-line; but from the previous and subsequent\r\nperformances of the Spanish navy, it may well be doubted if its worth\r\nwere equal to its numbers. England at this time had one hundred and\r\nthirty ships-of-the-line; four years later she had one hundred and\r\ntwenty actually in commission. Of course when a nation allows its\r\ninferiority, whether on land or sea, to become as great as that of\r\nFrance now was, it cannot hope for success.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she obtained advantages at first. The conquest of\r\nMinorca was followed in November of the same year by the acquisition\r\nof Corsica. The republic of Genoa surrendered to France all the\r\nfortified harbors of the island. With Toulon, Corsica, and Port Mahon,\r\nshe now had a strong grip on the Mediterranean. In Canada, the\r\noperations of 1756, under Montcalm, were successful despite the\r\ninferiority of numbers. At the same time an attack by a native prince\r\nin India took from the English Calcutta, and gave an opportunity to\r\nthe French.\r\n\r\nYet another incident offered a handle for French statesmanship to\r\nstrengthen her position on the ocean. The Dutch had promised France\r\nnot to renew their alliance with England, but to remain neutral.\r\nEngland retaliated by declaring \"all the ports of France in a state of\r\nblockade, and all vessels bound to those ports liable to seizure as\r\nlawful prize.\" Such a violation of the rights of neutrals can only be\r\nundertaken by a nation that feels it has nothing to fear from their\r\nrising against it. The aggressiveness, born of the sense of power,\r\nwhich characterized England might have been used by France to draw\r\nSpain and possibly other States into alliance against her.\r\n\r\nInstead of concentrating against England, France began another\r\ncontinental war, this time with a new and extraordinary alliance. The\r\nEmpress of Austria, working on the religious superstitions of the king\r\nand upon the anger of the king's mistress, who was piqued at sarcasms\r\nuttered against her by Frederick the Great, drew France into an\r\nalliance with Austria against Prussia. This alliance was further\r\njoined by Russia, Sweden and Poland. The empress urged that the two\r\nRoman Catholic powers should unite to take Silesia away from a\r\nProtestant king, and expressed her willingness to give to France a\r\npart of her possessions in the Netherlands, which France had always\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great, learning the combination against him, instead of\r\nwaiting for it to develop, put his armies in motion and invaded\r\nSaxony, whose ruler was also King of Poland. This movement, in\r\nOctober, 1756, began the Seven Years' War; which, like the War of the\r\nAustrian Succession, but not to the same extent, drew some of the\r\ncontestants off from the original cause of difference. But while\r\nFrance, having already on hand one large quarrel with her neighbor\r\nacross the Channel, was thus needlessly entering upon another\r\nstruggle, with the avowed end of building up that Austrian empire\r\nwhich a wiser policy had long striven to humble, England this time saw\r\nclearly where her true interests lay. Making the continental war\r\nwholly subsidiary, she turned her efforts upon the sea and the\r\ncolonies; at the same time supporting Frederick both with money and\r\ncordial sympathy in the war for the defence of his kingdom, which so\r\nseriously diverted and divided the efforts of France. England thus had\r\nreally but one war on hand. In the same year the direction of the\r\nstruggle was taken from the hands of a weak ministry and given into\r\nthose of the bold and ardent William Pitt, who retained his office\r\ntill 1761, by which time the ends of the war had practically been\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nIn the attack upon Canada there were two principal lines to be\r\nchosen,--that by the way of Lake Champlain, and that by the way of the\r\nSt. Lawrence. The former was entirely inland, and as such does not\r\nconcern our subject, beyond noting that not till after the fall of\r\nQuebec, in 1759, was it fairly opened to the English. In 1757 the\r\nattempt against Louisburg failed; the English admiral being unwilling\r\nto engage sixteen ships-of-the-line he found there, with the fifteen\r\nunder his own command, which were also, he said, of inferior metal.\r\nWhether he was right in his decision or not, the indignation felt in\r\nEngland clearly shows the difference of policy underlying the action\r\nof the French and English governments. The following year an admiral\r\nof a higher spirit, Boscawen, was sent out accompanied with twelve\r\nthousand troops, and, it must in fairness be said, found only five\r\nships in the port. The troops were landed, while the fleet covered\r\nthe siege from the only molestation it could fear, and cut off from\r\nthe besieged the only line by which they could look for supplies. The\r\nisland fell in 1758, opening the way by the St. Lawrence to the heart\r\nof Canada, and giving the English a new base both for the fleet and\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nThe next year the expedition under Wolfe was sent against Quebec. All\r\nhis operations were based upon the fleet, which not only carried his\r\narmy to the spot, but moved up and down the river as the various\r\nfeints required. The landing which led to the decisive action was made\r\ndirectly from the ships. Montcalm, whose skill and determination had\r\nblocked the attacks by way of Lake Champlain the two previous years,\r\nhad written urgently for reinforcements; but they were refused by the\r\nminister of war, who replied that in addition to other reasons it was\r\ntoo probable that the English would intercept them on the way, and\r\nthat the more France sent, the more England would be moved to send. In\r\na word, the possession of Canada depended upon sea power.\r\n\r\nMontcalm, therefore, in view of the certain attack upon Quebec by the\r\nriver, was compelled to weaken his resistance on the Champlain route;\r\nnevertheless, the English did not get farther than the foot of the\r\nlake that year, and their operations, though creditable, had no effect\r\nupon the result at Quebec.\r\n\r\nIn 1760, the English, holding the course of the St. Lawrence, with\r\nLouisburg at one end and Quebec at the other, seemed firmly seated.\r\nNevertheless, the French governor, De Vaudreuil, still held out at\r\nMontreal, and the colonists still hoped for help from France. The\r\nEnglish garrison at Quebec, though inferior in numbers to the forces\r\nof the Canadians, was imprudent enough to leave the city and meet them\r\nin the open field. Defeated there, and pursued by the enemy, the\r\nlatter nearly entered Quebec pell-mell with the English troops, and\r\ntrenches were opened against the city. A few days later an English\r\nsquadron came in sight, and the place was relieved. \"Thus,\" says the\r\nold English chronicler of the navy, \"the enemy saw what it was to be\r\ninferior at sea; for, had a French squadron got the start of the\r\nEnglish in sailing up the river, Quebec must have fallen.\" Wholly cut\r\noff now, the little body of Frenchmen that remained in Montreal was\r\nsurrounded by three English armies, which had come, one by way of Lake\r\nChamplain, the others from Oswego and from Quebec. The surrender of\r\nthe city on the 8th of September, 1760, put an end forever to the\r\nFrench possession of Canada.\r\n\r\nIn all other quarters of the world, after the accession of Pitt to\r\npower, the same good fortune followed the English arms, checkered only\r\nat the first by some slight reverses. It was not so on the continent,\r\nwhere the heroism and skill of Frederick the Great maintained with\r\ndifficulty his brilliant struggle against France, Austria, and Russia.\r\nThe study of the difficulties of his position, of the military and\r\npolitical combinations attending it, do not belong to our subject. Sea\r\npower does not appear directly in its effects upon the struggle, but\r\nindirectly it was felt in two ways,--first, by the subsidies which the\r\nabundant wealth and credit of England enabled her to give Frederick,\r\nin whose thrifty and able hands they went far; and second, in the\r\nembarrassment caused to France by the attacks of England upon her\r\ncolonies and her own sea-coast, in the destruction of her commerce,\r\nand in the money--all too little, it is true, and grudgingly\r\ngiven--which France was forced to bestow on her navy. Stung by the\r\nconstant lashing of the Power of the sea, France, despite the\r\nblindness and unwillingness of the rulers, was driven to undertake\r\nsomething against it. With a navy much inferior, unable to cope in all\r\nquarters of the world, it was rightly decided to concentrate upon one\r\nobject; and the object chosen was Great Britain itself, whose shores\r\nwere to be invaded. This decision, soon apprehended by the fears of\r\nthe English nation, caused the great naval operations to centre for\r\nsome years around the coast of France and in the Channel. Before\r\ndescribing them, it will be well to sum up the general plan by which\r\nEngland was guided in the use of her overwhelming sea power.\r\n\r\nBesides the operations on the North American continent already\r\ndescribed, this plan was fourfold:--\r\n\r\n1. The French Atlantic ports were watched in force, especially Brest,\r\nso as to keep the great fleets or small squadrons from getting out\r\nwithout fighting.\r\n\r\n2. Attacks were made upon the Atlantic and Channel coasts with flying\r\nsquadrons, followed at times by the descent of small bodies of troops.\r\nThese attacks, the direction of which could not be foreseen by the\r\nenemy, were chiefly intended to compel him to keep on hand forces at\r\nmany points, and so to diminish the army acting against the King of\r\nPrussia. While the tendency would certainly be that way, it may be\r\ndoubted whether the actual diversion in favor of Frederick was of much\r\nconsequence. No particular mention will be made of these operations,\r\nwhich had but little visible effect upon the general course of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n3. A fleet was kept in the Mediterranean and near Gibraltar to prevent\r\nthe French Toulon fleet from getting round to the Atlantic. It does\r\nnot appear that any attempt was seriously made to stop communications\r\nbetween France and Minorca. The action of the Mediterranean fleet,\r\nthough an independent command, was subsidiary to that in the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n4. Distant foreign expeditions were sent against the French colonies\r\nin the West India Islands and on the coast of Africa, and a squadron\r\nwas maintained in the East Indies to secure the control of those seas,\r\nthereby supporting the English in the Peninsula, and cutting off the\r\ncommunications of the French. These operations in distant waters,\r\nnever intermitted, assumed greater activity and larger proportions\r\nafter the destruction of the French navy had relieved England from the\r\nfear of invasion, and when the ill-advised entrance of Spain into the\r\nwar, in 1762, offered yet richer prizes to her enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe close blockade of the enemy's fleet in Brest, which was first\r\nsystematically carried out during this war, may be considered rather a\r\ndefensive than an offensive operation; for though the intention\r\ncertainly was to fight if opportunity offered, the chief object was to\r\nneutralize an offensive weapon in the enemy's hands; the destruction\r\nof the weapon was secondary. The truth of this remark is shown by the\r\noutburst of fear and anger which swept over England when an\r\nunavoidable absence of the blockading fleet in 1759 allowed the French\r\nto escape. The effect of the blockade in this and after wars was to\r\nkeep the French in a state of constant inferiority in the practical\r\nhandling of their ships, however fair-showing their outward appearance\r\nor equal their numerical force. The position of the port of Brest was\r\nsuch that a blockaded fleet could not get out during the heavy\r\nwesterly gales that endangered the blockaders; the latter, therefore,\r\nhad the habit of running away from them to Torbay or Plymouth, sure,\r\nwith care, of getting back to their station with an east wind before a\r\nlarge and ill-handled fleet could get much start of them.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1758, France, depressed by the sense of failure\r\nupon the continent, mortified and harassed by English descents upon\r\nher coasts, which had been particularly annoying that year, and seeing\r\nthat it was not possible to carry on both the continental and sea wars\r\nwith her money resources, determined to strike directly at England.\r\nHer commerce was annihilated while the enemy's throve. It was the\r\nboast of London merchants that under Pitt commerce was united with and\r\nmade to flourish by war;[98] and this thriving commerce was the soul\r\nalso of the land struggle, by the money it lavished on the enemy of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nAt this time a new and active-minded minister, Choiseul, was called\r\ninto power by Louis XV. From the beginning of 1759, preparations were\r\nmade in the ocean and Channel ports. Flat-boats to transport troops\r\nwere built at Havre, Dunkirk, Brest, and Rochefort. It was intended to\r\nembark as many as fifty thousand men for the invasion of England,\r\nwhile twelve thousand were to be directed upon Scotland. Two squadrons\r\nwere fitted out, each of respectable strength, one at Toulon, the\r\nother at Brest. The junction of these two squadrons at Brest was the\r\nfirst step in the great enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt was just here that it broke down, through the possession of\r\nGibraltar by the English, and their naval superiority. It seems\r\nincredible that even the stern and confident William Pitt should, as\r\nlate as 1757, have offered to surrender to Spain the watch-tower from\r\nwhich England overlooks the road between the Mediterranean and the\r\nAtlantic, as the price of her help to recover Minorca. Happily for\r\nEngland, Spain refused. In 1759, Admiral Boscawen commanded the\r\nEnglish Mediterranean fleet. In making an attack upon French frigates\r\nin Toulon roads, some of his ships were so damaged that he sailed with\r\nhis whole squadron to Gibraltar to refit; taking the precaution,\r\nhowever, to station lookout frigates at intervals, and to arrange\r\nsignals by guns to notify him betimes of the enemy's approach. Taking\r\nadvantage of his absence, and in obedience to orders, the French\r\ncommodore, De la Clue, left Toulon with twelve ships-of-the-line on\r\nthe 5th of August, and on the 17th found himself at the Straits of\r\nGibraltar, with a brisk east wind carrying him out into the Atlantic.\r\nEverything seemed propitious, a thick haze and falling night\r\nconcealing the French ships from the land, while not preventing their\r\nsight of each other, when an English frigate loomed up in the near\r\ndistance. As soon as she saw the fleet, knowing they must be enemies,\r\nshe hauled in for the land and began firing signal-guns. Pursuit was\r\nuseless; flight alone remained. Hoping to elude the chase he knew must\r\nfollow, the French commodore steered west-northwest for the open sea,\r\nputting out all lights; but either from carelessness or\r\ndisaffection,--for the latter is hinted by one French naval\r\nofficer,--five out of the twelve ships headed to the northward and put\r\ninto Cadiz when on the following morning they could not see the\r\ncommodore. The latter was dismayed when at daylight he saw his forces\r\nthus diminished. At eight o'clock some sails made their appearance,\r\nand for a few minutes he hoped they were the missing ships. Instead\r\nof that, they were the lookouts of Boscawen's fleet, which, numbering\r\nfourteen ships-of-the-line, was in full pursuit. The French formed\r\ntheir order on one of the close-hauled lines, and fled; but of course\r\ntheir fleet-speed was less than that of the fastest English ships. The\r\ngeneral rule for all chases where the pursuer is decidedly superior,\r\nnamely, that order must be observed only so far as to keep the leading\r\nships within reasonable supporting distance of the slower ones, so\r\nthat they may not be singly overpowered before the latter can come up,\r\nwas by this time well understood in the English navy, and that is\r\ncertainly the fitting time for a _mélêe_. Boscawen acted accordingly.\r\nThe rear ship of the French, on the other hand, nobly emulated the\r\nexample of L'Étenduère when he saved his convoy. Overtaken at two\r\no'clock by the leading English ship, and soon after surrounded by four\r\nothers, her captain made for five hours a desperate resistance, from\r\nwhich he could hope, not to save himself, but to delay the enemies\r\nlong enough for the better sailers to escape. He so far succeeded\r\nthat--thanks to the injury done by him and their better speed--they\r\ndid that day escape action at close quarters, which could only have\r\nended in their capture. When he hauled down his flag, his three\r\ntopmasts were gone, the mizzen-mast fell immediately after, and the\r\nhull was so full of water that the ship was with difficulty kept\r\nafloat. M. de Sabran--his name is worthy to be remembered--had\r\nreceived eleven wounds in this gallant resistance, by which he\r\nillustrated so signally the duty and service of a rearguard in\r\nretarding pursuit. That night two of the French ships hauled off to\r\nthe westward, and so escaped. The other four continued their flight as\r\nbefore; but the next morning the commodore, despairing of escape,\r\nheaded for the Portuguese coast, and ran them all ashore between Lagos\r\nand Cape St. Vincent. The English admiral followed and attacked them,\r\ntaking two and burning the others, without regard to the neutrality of\r\nPortugal. For this insult no amend was made beyond a formal apology;\r\nPortugal was too dependent upon England to be seriously considered.\r\nPitt, writing to the English minister to Portugal about the affair,\r\ntold him that while soothing the susceptibilities of the Portuguese\r\ngovernment he must not allow it to suppose that either the ships would\r\nbe given up or the distinguished admiral censured.[99]\r\n\r\nThe destruction or dispersal of the Toulon fleet stopped the invasion\r\nof England, though the five ships that got into Cadiz remained a\r\nmatter of anxiety to Sir Edward Hawke, who cruised before Brest.\r\nChoiseul, balked of his main object, still clung to the invasion of\r\nScotland. The French fleet at Brest, under Marshal de Conflans, a sea\r\nofficer despite his title, numbered twenty sail-of-the-line, besides\r\nfrigates. The troops to be embarked are variously stated at fifteen to\r\ntwenty thousand. The original purpose was to escort the transports\r\nwith only five ships-of-the-line, besides smaller vessels. Conflans\r\ninsisted that the whole fleet ought to go. The minister of the navy\r\nthought that the admiral was not a sufficiently skilful tactician to\r\nbe able to check the advance of an enemy, and so insure the safe\r\narrival of the convoy at its destination near the Clyde without\r\nrisking a decisive encounter. Believing therefore that there would be\r\na general action, he considered that it would be better to fight it\r\nbefore the troops sailed; for if disastrous, the convoy would not be\r\nsacrificed, and if decisively victorious, the road would then be\r\nclear. The transports were assembled, not at Brest, but in the ports\r\nto the southward as far as the mouth of the Loire. The French fleet\r\ntherefore put to sea with the expectation and purpose of fighting the\r\nenemy; but it is not easy to reconcile its subsequent course with that\r\npurpose, nor with the elaborate fighting instructions[100] issued by\r\nthe admiral before sailing.\r\n\r\nAbout the 5th or 6th of November there came on a tremendous westerly\r\ngale. After buffeting it for three days, Hawke bore up and ran into\r\nTorbay, where he waited for the wind to shift, keeping his fleet in\r\nreadiness to sail at once. The same gale, while keeping back the\r\nFrench already in Brest, gave the chance to a small squadron under M.\r\nBompart, which was expected from the West Indies, to slip in during\r\nHawke's absence. Conflans made his preparations with activity,\r\ndistributed Bompart's crews among his own ships, which were not very\r\nwell manned, and got to sea with an easterly wind on the 14th. He\r\nstood at once to the southward, flattering himself that he had escaped\r\nHawke. The latter, however, had sailed from Torbay on the 12th; and\r\nthough again driven back, sailed a second time on the 14th, the same\r\nday that Conflans left Brest. He soon readied his station, learned\r\nthat the enemy had been seen to the southward steering east, and\r\neasily concluding that they were bound to Quiberon Bay, shaped his own\r\ncourse for the same place under a press of sail. At eleven P.M. of the\r\n19th the French admiral estimated his position to be seventy miles\r\nsouthwest by west from Belle Isle;[101] and the wind springing up\r\nfresh from the westward, he stood for it under short sail, the wind\r\ncontinuing to increase and hauling to west-northwest. At daybreak\r\nseveral ships were seen ahead, which proved to be the English squadron\r\nof Commodore Duff, blockading Quiberon. The signal was made to chase;\r\nand the English, taking flight, separated into two divisions,--one\r\ngoing off before the wind, the other hauling up to the southward. The\r\ngreater part of the French fleet continued its course after the former\r\ndivision, that is, toward the coast; but one ship hauled up for the\r\nsecond. Immediately after, the rear French ships made signal of sails\r\nto windward, which were also visible from aloft on board the\r\nflag-ship. It must have been about the same moment that the lookout\r\nfrigate in advance of the English fleet informed her admiral of sails\r\nto leeward. Hawke's diligence had brought him up with Conflans, who,\r\nin his official reports, says he had considered it impossible that the\r\nenemy could have in that neighborhood forces superior or even equal to\r\nhis own. Conflans now ordered his rear division to haul its wind in\r\nsupport of the ship chasing to the southward and eastward. In a few\r\nmoments more it was discovered that the fleet to windward numbered\r\ntwenty-three ships-of-the-line to the French twenty-one, and among\r\nthem some three-deckers. Conflans then called in the chasing ships and\r\ngot ready for action. It remained to settle his course under\r\ncircumstances which he had not foreseen. It was now blowing hard from\r\nthe west-northwest, with every appearance of heavy weather, the fleet\r\nnot far from a lee shore, with an enemy considerably superior in\r\nnumbers; for besides Hawke's twenty-three of the line, Duff had four\r\nfifty-gun ships. Conflans therefore determined to run for it and lead\r\nhis squadron into Quiberon Bay, trusting and believing that Hawke\r\nwould not dare to follow, under the conditions of the weather, into a\r\nbay which French authorities describe as containing banks and shoals,\r\nand lined with reefs which the navigator rarely sees without fright\r\nand never passes without emotion. It was in the midst of these ghastly\r\ndangers that forty-four large ships were about to engage pell-mell;\r\nfor the space was too contracted for fleet manoeuvres. Conflans\r\nflattered himself that he would get in first and be able to haul up\r\nclose under the western shore of the bay, forcing the enemy, if he\r\nfollowed, to take position between him and the beach, six miles to\r\nleeward. None of his expectations were fulfilled. In the retreat he\r\ntook the head of his fleet; a step not unjustifiable, since only by\r\nleading in person could he have shown just what he wanted to do, but\r\nunfortunate for his reputation with the public, as it placed the\r\nadmiral foremost in the flight. Hawke was not in the least, nor for\r\none moment, deterred by the dangers before him, whose full extent he,\r\nas a skilful seaman, entirely realized; but his was a calm and\r\nsteadfast as well as a gallant temper, that weighed risks justly,\r\nneither dissembling nor exaggerating. He has not left us his\r\nreasoning, but he doubtless felt that the French, leading, would serve\r\npartially as pilots, and must take the ground before him; he believed\r\nthe temper and experience of his officers, tried by the severe school\r\nof the blockade, to be superior to those of the French; and he knew\r\nthat both the government and the country demanded that the enemy's\r\nfleet should not reach another friendly port in safety. On the very\r\nday that he was thus following the French, amid dangers and under\r\nconditions that have made this one of the most dramatic of sea fights,\r\nhe was being burnt in effigy in England for allowing them to escape.\r\nAs Conflans, leading his fleet, was rounding the Cardinals,--as the\r\nsouthernmost rocks at the entrance of Quiberon Bay are called,--the\r\nleading English ships brought the French rear to action. It was\r\nanother case of a general chase ending in a _mêlée_, but under\r\nconditions of exceptional interest and grandeur from the surrounding\r\ncircumstances of the gale of wind, the heavy sea, the lee shore, the\r\nheadlong speed, shortened canvas, and the great number of ships\r\nengaged. One French seventy-four, closely pressed and outnumbered,\r\nventured to open her lower-deck ports; the sea sweeping in carried her\r\ndown with all on board but twenty men. Another was sunk by the fire of\r\nHawke's flag-ship. Two others, one of which carried a commodore's\r\npennant, struck their colors. The remainder were dispersed. Seven fled\r\nto the northward and eastward, and anchored off the mouth of the\r\nlittle river Vilaine, into which they succeeded in entering at the top\r\nof high water in two tides,--a feat never before performed. Seven\r\nothers took refuge to the southward and eastward in Rochefort. One,\r\nafter being very badly injured, ran ashore and was lost near the mouth\r\nof the Loire. The flag-ship bearing the same name as that of Tourville\r\nburned at La Hougue, the \"Royal Sun,\" anchored at nightfall off\r\nCroisic, a little to the northward of the Loire, where she rode in\r\nsafety during the night. The next morning the admiral found himself\r\nalone, and, somewhat precipitately it would seem, ran the ship ashore\r\nto keep her out of English hands. This step has been blamed by the\r\nFrench, but needlessly, as Hawke would never have let her get away.\r\nThe great French fleet was annihilated; for the fourteen ships not\r\ntaken or destroyed were divided into two parts, and those in the\r\nVilaine only succeeded in escaping, two at a time, between fifteen\r\nmonths and two years later. The English lost two ships which ran upon\r\na shoal (a), and were hopelessly wrecked; their losses in action were\r\nslight. At nightfall Hawke anchored his fleet and prizes in the\r\nposition shown in the plate (b).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. VIII.]\r\n\r\nAll possibility of an invasion of England passed away with the\r\ndestruction of the Brest fleet. The battle of November 20, 1759, was\r\nthe Trafalgar of this war; and though a blockade was maintained over\r\nthe fractions that were laid up in the Vilaine and at Rochefort, the\r\nEnglish fleets were now free to act against the colonies of France,\r\nand later of Spain, on a grander scale than ever before. The same year\r\nthat saw this great sea fight and the fall of Quebec witnessed also\r\nthe capture of Guadeloupe in the West Indies, of Goree on the west\r\ncoast of Africa, and the abandonment of the East Indian seas by the\r\nFrench flag after three indecisive actions between their commodore,\r\nD'Aché, and Admiral Pocock,--an abandonment which necessarily led to\r\nthe fall of the French power in India, never again to rise. In this\r\nyear also the King of Spain died, and his brother succeeded, under the\r\ntitle of Charles III. This Charles had been King of Naples at the time\r\nwhen an English commodore had allowed one hour for the court to\r\ndetermine to withdraw the Neapolitan troops from the Spanish army. He\r\nhad never forgotten this humiliation, and brought to his new throne a\r\nheart unfriendly to England. With such feelings on his part, France\r\nand Spain drew more readily together. Charles's first step was to\r\npropose mediation, but Pitt was averse to it. Looking upon France as\r\nthe chief enemy of England, and upon the sea and the colonies as the\r\nchief source of power and wealth, he wished, now that he had her down,\r\nto weaken her thoroughly for the future as well as the present, and to\r\nestablish England's greatness more firmly upon the wreck. Later on he\r\noffered certain conditions; but the influence of Louis's mistress,\r\nattached to the Empress of Austria, prevailed to except Prussia from\r\nthe negotiations, and England would not allow the exception. Pitt,\r\nindeed, was not yet ready for peace. A year later, October 25, 1760,\r\nGeorge II. died, and Pitt's influence then began to wane, the new\r\nking being less bent on war. During these years, 1759 and 1760,\r\nFrederick the Great still continued the deadly and exhausting strife\r\nof his small kingdom against the great States joined against him. At\r\none moment his case seemed so hopeless that he got ready to kill\r\nhimself; but the continuance of the war diverted the efforts of France\r\nfrom England and the sea.\r\n\r\nThe hour was fast approaching for the great colonial expeditions,\r\nwhich made the last year of the war illustrious by the triumph of the\r\nsea power of England over France and Spain united. It is first\r\nnecessary to tell the entirely kindred story of the effect of that sea\r\npower in the East Indian peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe recall of Dupleix and the entire abandonment of his policy, which\r\nresulted in placing the two East India companies on equal terms, have\r\nalready been told. The treaty stipulations of 1754 had not, however,\r\nbeen fully carried out. The Marquis de Bussy, a brave and capable\r\nsoldier who had been a second to Dupleix, and was wholly in accord\r\nwith his policy and ambitions, remained in the Deccan,--a large region\r\nin the southern central part of the peninsula, over which Dupleix had\r\nonce ruled. In 1756, troubles arose between the English and the native\r\nprince in Bengal. The nabob of that province had died, and his\r\nsuccessor, a young man of nineteen, attacked Calcutta. The place fell,\r\nafter a weak resistance, in June, and the surrender was followed by\r\nthe famous tragedy known as that of the Black Hole of Calcutta. The\r\nnews reached Madras in August, and Clive, whose name has already been\r\nmentioned, sailed with the fleet of Admiral Watson, after a long and\r\nvexatious delay. The fleet entered the river in December and appeared\r\nbefore Calcutta in January, when the place fell into English hands\r\nagain as easily as it had been lost.\r\n\r\nThe nabob was very angry, and marched against the English; sending\r\nmeanwhile an invitation to the French at Chandernagore to join him.\r\nAlthough it was now known that England and France were at war, the\r\nFrench company, despite the experience of 1744, weakly hoped that\r\npeace might be kept between it and the English. The native invitation\r\nwas therefore refused, and offers of neutrality made to the other\r\ncompany. Clive marched out, met the Indian forces and defeated them,\r\nand the nabob at once asked for peace, and sought the English\r\nalliance, yielding all the claims on the strength of which he had\r\nfirst attacked Calcutta. After some demur his offers were accepted.\r\nClive and Watson then turned upon Chandernagore and compelled the\r\nsurrender of the French settlement.\r\n\r\nThe nabob, who had not meant to allow this, took umbrage, and entered\r\ninto correspondence with Bussy in the Deccan. Clive had full knowledge\r\nof his various intrigues, which were carried on with the vacillation\r\nof a character as weak as it was treacherous; and seeing no hope of\r\nsettled peace or trade under the rule of this man, entered into an\r\nextensive conspiracy for his dethronement, the details of which need\r\nnot be given. The result was that war broke out again, and that Clive\r\nwith three thousand men, one third of whom were English, met the nabob\r\nat the head of fifteen thousand horse and thirty-five thousand foot.\r\nThe disproportion in artillery was nearly as great. Against these odds\r\nwas fought and won the battle of Plassey, on the 23d of June,\r\n1757,--the date from which, by common consent, the British empire in\r\nIndia is said to begin. The overthrow of the nabob was followed by\r\nplacing in power one of the conspirators against him, a creature of\r\nthe English, and dependent upon them for support. Bengal thus passed\r\nunder their control, the first-fruits of India. \"Clive,\" says a French\r\nhistorian, \"had understood and applied the system of Dupleix.\"\r\n\r\nThis was true; yet even so it may be said that the foundation thus\r\nlaid could never have been kept nor built upon, had the English nation\r\nnot controlled the sea. The conditions of India were such that a few\r\nEuropeans, headed by men of nerve and shrewdness, dividing that they\r\nmight conquer, and advancing their fortunes by judicious alliances,\r\nwere able to hold their own, and more too, amidst overwhelming\r\nnumerical odds; but it was necessary that they should not be opposed\r\nby men of their own kind, a few of whom could turn the wavering\r\nbalance the other way. At the very time that Clive was acting in\r\nBengal, Bussy invaded Orissa, seized the English factories, and made\r\nhimself master of much of the coast regions between Madras and\r\nCalcutta; while a French squadron of nine ships, most of which,\r\nhowever, belonged to the East India Company and were not first-rate\r\nmen-of-war, was on its way to Pondicherry with twelve hundred regular\r\ntroops,--an enormous European army for Indian operations of that day.\r\nThe English naval force on the coast, though fewer in numbers, may be\r\nconsidered about equal to the approaching French squadron. It is\r\nscarcely too much to say that the future of India was still uncertain,\r\nand the first operations showed it.\r\n\r\nThe French division appeared off the Coromandel coast to the southward\r\nof Pondicherry on the 26th of April, 1758, and anchored on the 28th\r\nbefore the English station called Fort St. David. Two ships kept on to\r\nPondicherry, having on board the new governor, Comte de Lally, who\r\nwished to go at once to his seat of government. Meanwhile, the English\r\nadmiral, Pocock, having news of the enemy's coming, and fearing\r\nspecially for this post, was on his way to it, and appeared on the\r\n29th of April, before the two ships with the governor were out of\r\nsight. The French at once got under way and stood out to sea on the\r\nstarboard tack (Plate Va.), heading to the northward and eastward, the\r\nwind being southeast, and signals were made to recall the ship and\r\nfrigate (a) escorting Lally; but they were disregarded by the latter's\r\norder, an act which must have increased, if it did not originate, the\r\nill-will between him and Commodore d'Aché, through which the French\r\ncampaign in India miscarried. The English, having formed to windward\r\non the same tack as the French, made their attack in the then usual\r\nway, and with the usual results. The seven English ships were ordered\r\nto keep away together for the French eight, and the four leading\r\nships, including the admiral's, came into action handsomely; the last\r\nthree, whether by their own fault or not, were late in doing so, but\r\nit will be remembered that this was almost always the case in such\r\nattacks. The French commodore, seeing this interval between the van\r\nand the rear, formed the plan of separating them, and made signal to\r\nwear together, but in his impatience did not wait for an answer.\r\nPutting his own helm up, he wore round, and was followed in succession\r\nby the rear ships, while the van stood on. The English admiral, who\r\nhad good reason to know, gives D'Aché more credit than the French\r\nwriters, for he describes this movement thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"At half-past four P.M. the rear of the French line had drawn\r\n    pretty close up to their flag-ship. Our three rear ships were\r\n    signalled to engage closer. Soon after, M. d'Aché broke the\r\n    line, and put before the wind; his second astern, who had kept\r\n    on the 'Yarmouth's' [English flag-ship] quarter most part of the\r\n    action, then came up alongside, gave his fire, and then bore\r\n    away; and a few minutes after, the enemy's van bore away also.\"\r\n\r\nBy this account, which is by no means irreconcilable with the French,\r\nthe latter effected upon the principal English ship a movement of\r\nconcentration by defiling past her. The French now stood down to their\r\ntwo separated ships, while the English vessels that had been engaged\r\nwere too much crippled to follow. This battle prevented the English\r\nfleet from relieving Fort St. David, which surrendered on the 2d of\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of this place, the two opposing squadrons having\r\nrefitted at their respective ports and resumed their station, a second\r\naction was fought in August, under nearly the same conditions and in\r\nmuch the same fashion. The French flag-ship met with a series of\r\nuntoward accidents, which determined the commodore to withdraw from\r\naction; but the statement of his further reasons is most suggestive of\r\nthe necessary final overthrow of the French cause. \"Prudence,\" a\r\nwriter of his own country says, \"commanded him not to prolong a\r\ncontest from which his ships could not but come out with injuries very\r\ndifficult to repair in a region where it was impossible to supply the\r\nalmost entire lack of spare stores.\" This want of so absolute a\r\nrequisite for naval efficiency shows in a strong light the fatal\r\ntendency of that economy which always characterized French operations\r\nat sea, and was at once significant and ominous.\r\n\r\nReturning to Pondicherry, D'Aché found that, though the injuries to\r\nthe masts and rigging could for this time be repaired, there was lack\r\nof provisions, and that the ships needed calking. Although his orders\r\nwere to remain on the coast until October 15, he backed himself with\r\nthe opinion of a council of war which decided that the ships could not\r\nremain there longer, because, in case of a third battle, there was\r\nneither rigging nor supplies remaining in Pondicherry; and\r\ndisregarding the protests of the governor, Lally, he sailed on the 2d\r\nof September for the Isle of France. The underlying motive of D'Aché,\r\nit is known, was hostility to the governor, with whom he quarrelled\r\ncontinually. Lally, deprived of the help of the squadron, turned his\r\narms inland instead of against Madras.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at the islands, D'Aché found a state of things which\r\nagain singularly illustrates the impotence and short-sightedness\r\ncharacteristic of the general naval policy of the French at this time.\r\nHis arrival there was as unwelcome as his departure from India had\r\nbeen to Lally. The islands were then in a state of the most complete\r\ndestitution. The naval division, increased by the arrival of three\r\nships-of-the-line from home, so exhausted them that its immediate\r\ndeparture was requested of the commodore. Repairs were pushed ahead\r\nrapidly, and in November several of the ships sailed to the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, then a Dutch colony, to seek provisions; but these were\r\nconsumed soon after being received, and the pressure for the departure\r\nof the squadron was renewed. The situation of the ships was no less\r\nprecarious than that of the colony; and accordingly the commodore\r\nreplied by urging his entire lack of food and supplies. The condition\r\nwas such that, a little later, it was necessary to make running\r\nrigging out of the cables, and to put some of the ships on the bottom,\r\nso as to give their materials to others. Before returning to India,\r\nD'Aché wrote to the minister of the navy that he \"was about to leave,\r\nonly to save the crews from dying of hunger, and that nothing need be\r\nexpected from the squadron if supplies were not sent, for both men and\r\nthings were in a deplorable state.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances D'Aché sailed from the islands in July,\r\n1759, and arrived off the Coromandel coast in September. During his\r\nyear of absence Lally had besieged Madras for two months, during the\r\nnortheast monsoon. Both squadrons were absent, that season being unfit\r\nfor naval operations on this coast; but the English returned first,\r\nand are said by the French to have caused, by the English to have\r\nhastened, the raising of the siege. D'Aché, upon his return, was much\r\nsuperior in both number and size of ships; but when the fleets met,\r\nPocock did not hesitate to attack with nine against eleven. This\r\naction, fought September 10, 1759, was as indecisive as the two\r\nformer; but D'Aché retreated, after a very bloody contest. Upon it\r\nCampbell, in his \"Lives of the Admirals,\" makes a droll, but seemingly\r\nserious, comment: \"Pocock had reduced the French ships to a very\r\nshattered condition, and killed a great many of their men; but what\r\nshows the singular talents of both admirals, they had fought three\r\npitched battles in eighteen months without the loss of a ship on\r\neither side.\" The fruits of victory, however, were with the weaker\r\nfleet; for D'Aché returned to Pondicherry and thence sailed on the 1st\r\nof the next month for the islands, leaving India to its fate. From\r\nthat time the result was certain. The English continued to receive\r\nreinforcements from home, while the French did not; the men opposed to\r\nLally were superior in ability; place after place fell, and in\r\nJanuary, 1761, Pondicherry itself surrendered, surrounded by land and\r\ncut off from the sea. This was the end of the French power in India;\r\nfor though Pondicherry and other possessions were restored at the\r\npeace, the English tenure there was never again shaken, even under the\r\nattacks of the skilful and bold Suffren, who twenty years later met\r\ndifficulties as great as D'Aché's with a vigor and conduct which the\r\nlatter at a more hopeful moment failed to show.\r\n\r\nFrance having thus lost both Canada and India by the evident failure\r\nof her power to act at a distance by sea, it would seem scarcely\r\npossible that Spain, with her own weak navy and widely scattered\r\npossessions, would choose this moment for entering the war. Yet so it\r\nwas. The maritime exhaustion of France was plain to all, and is\r\nabundantly testified to by her naval historians. \"The resources of\r\nFrance were exhausted,\" says one; \"the year 1761 saw only a few single\r\nships leave her ports, and all of them were captured. The alliance\r\nwith Spain came too late. The occasional ships that went to sea in\r\n1762 were taken, and the colonies still remaining to France could not\r\nbe saved.\"[102] Even as early as 1758, another Frenchman writes, \"want\r\nof money, the depression of commerce given over to English cruisers,\r\nthe lack of good ships, the lack of supplies, etc., compelled the\r\nFrench ministry, unable to raise large forces, to resort to\r\nstratagems, to replace the only rational system of war, Grand War, by\r\nthe smallest of petty wars,--by a sort of game in which the great aim\r\nis not to be caught. Even then, the arrival of four ships-of-the-line\r\nat Louisburg, by avoiding the enemy, was looked on as a very fortunate\r\nevent.... In 1759 the lucky arrival of the West India convoy caused as\r\nmuch surprise as joy to the merchants. We see how rare had become such\r\na chance in seas ploughed by the squadrons of England.\"[103] This was\r\nbefore the disasters of La Clue and Conflans. The destruction of\r\nFrench commerce, beginning by the capture of its merchant-ships, was\r\nconsummated by the reduction of the colonies. It can hardly,\r\ntherefore, be conceded that the Family Compact now made between the\r\ntwo courts, containing, as it did, not only an agreement to support\r\neach other in any future war, but also a secret clause binding Spain\r\nto declare war against England within a year, if peace were not made,\r\n\"was honorable to the wisdom of the two governments.\" It is hard to\r\npardon, not only the Spanish government, but even France for alluring\r\na kindred people into such a bad bargain. It was hoped, however, to\r\nrevive the French navy and to promote an alliance of neutral powers;\r\nmany of which, besides Spain, had causes of complaint against England.\r\n\"During the war with France,\" confesses an English historian, \"the\r\nSpanish flag had not always been respected by British cruisers.\"[104]\r\n\"During 1758,\" says another, \"not less than one hundred and\r\nseventy-six neutral vessels, laden with the rich produce of the French\r\ncolonies or with military or naval stores, fell into the hands of the\r\nEnglish.\"[105] The causes were already at work which twenty years\r\nlater gave rise to the \"armed neutrality\" of the Baltic powers,\r\ndirected against the claims of England on the sea. The possession of\r\nunlimited power, as the sea power of England then really was, is\r\nseldom accompanied by a profound respect for the rights of others.\r\nWithout a rival upon the ocean, it suited England to maintain that\r\nenemy's property was liable to capture on board neutral ships, thus\r\nsubjecting these nations not only to vexatious detentions, but to loss\r\nof valuable trade; just as it had suited her earlier in the war to\r\nestablish a paper blockade of French ports. Neutrals of course chafed\r\nunder these exactions; but the year 1761 was ill-chosen for an armed\r\nprotest, and of all powers Spain risked most by a war. England had\r\nthen one hundred and twenty ships-of-the-line in commission, besides\r\nthose in reserve, manned by seventy thousand seamen trained and\r\nhardened by five years of constant warfare afloat, and flushed with\r\nvictory. The navy of France, which numbered seventy-seven\r\nships-of-the-line in 1758, lost as prizes to the English in 1759\r\ntwenty-seven, besides eight destroyed and many frigates lost; indeed,\r\nas has been seen, their own writers confess that the navy was ruined,\r\nroot and branch. The Spanish navy contained about fifty ships; but the\r\npersonnel, unless very different from the days before and after, must\r\nhave been very inferior. The weakness of her empire, in the absence of\r\nan efficient navy, has before been pointed out. Neutrality, too,\r\nthough at times outraged, had been of great advantage to her,\r\npermitting her to restore her finances and trade and to re-establish\r\nher internal resources; but she needed a still longer period of it.\r\nNevertheless, the king, influenced by family feeling and resentment\r\nagainst England, allowed himself to be drawn on by the astute\r\nChoiseul, and the Family Compact between the two crowns was signed on\r\nthe 15th of August, 1761. This compact, into which the King of Naples\r\nwas also to enter, guaranteed their mutual possessions by the whole\r\npower of both kingdoms. This in itself was a weighty undertaking; but\r\nthe secret clause further stipulated that Spain should declare war\r\nagainst England on the 1st of May, 1762, if peace with France had not\r\nthen been made. Negotiations of this character could not be kept\r\nwholly secret, and Pitt learned enough to convince him that Spain was\r\nbecoming hostile in intention. With his usual haughty resolve, he\r\ndetermined to forestall her by declaring war; but the influence\r\nagainst him in the councils of the new king was too strong. Failing to\r\ncarry the ministry with him, he resigned on the 5th of October, 1761.\r\nHis prevision was quickly justified; Spain had been eager in\r\nprofessing good-will until the treasure-ships from America should\r\narrive laden with the specie so needed for carrying on war. On the\r\n21st of September the Flota of galleons anchored safely in Cadiz; and\r\non the 2d of November the British ambassador announced to his\r\ngovernment that \"two ships had safely arrived with very extraordinary\r\nrich cargoes from the West Indies, so that all the wealth that was\r\nexpected from Spanish America is now safe in old Spain,\" and in the\r\nsame despatch reports a surprising change in the words of the Spanish\r\nminister, and the haughty language now used.[106] The grievences and\r\nclaims of Spain were urged peremptorily, and the quarrel grew so fast\r\nthat even the new English ministry, though ardently desiring peace,\r\nrecalled their ambassador before the end of the year, and declared war\r\non the 4th of January, 1762; thus adopting Pitt's policy, but too late\r\nto reap the advantages at which he had aimed.\r\n\r\nHowever, no such delay on the part of England could alter the\r\nessential inequality, in strength and preparation, between the two\r\nnations. The plans formed by Pitt were in the main adopted by his\r\nsuccessor, and carried out with a speed which the readiness of the\r\nEnglish navy permitted. On the 5th of March, Pocock, who had returned\r\nfrom the East Indies, sailed from Portsmouth, convoying a fleet of\r\ntransports to act against Havana; in the West Indies he was reinforced\r\nfrom the forces in that quarter, so that his command contained\r\nnineteen ships-of-the-line besides smaller vessels, and ten thousand\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nIn the previous January, the West India fleet, under the well-known\r\nRodney, had acted with the land forces in the reduction of Martinique,\r\nthe gem and tower of the French islands and the harbor of an extensive\r\nprivateering system. It is said that fourteen hundred English\r\nmerchantmen were taken during this war in the West Indian seas by\r\ncruisers whose principal port was Fort Royal in Martinique. With this\r\nnecessary base fell also the privateering system resting upon it.\r\nMartinique was surrendered February 12, and the loss of this chief\r\ncommercial and military centre was immediately followed by that of the\r\nsmaller islands, Grenada, Sta. Lucia, St. Vincent. By these\r\nacquisitions the English colonies at Antigua, St. Kitts, and Nevis, as\r\nwell as the ships trading to those islands, were secured against the\r\nenemy, the commerce of England received large additions, and all the\r\nLesser Antilles, or Windward Islands, became British possessions.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Pocock was joined off Cape St. Nicholas by the West Indian\r\nreinforcement on the 27th of May, and as the season was so far\r\nadvanced, he took his great fleet through the old Bahama channel\r\ninstead of the usual route around the south side of Cuba. This was\r\njustly considered a great feat in those days of poor surveys, and was\r\naccomplished without an accident. Lookout and sounding vessels went\r\nfirst, frigates followed, and boats or sloops were anchored on shoals\r\nwith carefully arranged signals for day or night. Having good weather,\r\nthe fleet got through in a week and appeared before Havana. The\r\noperations will not be given in detail. After a forty days' siege the\r\nMoro Castle was taken on the 30th of July, and the city surrendered on\r\nthe 10th of August. The Spaniards lost not only the city and port, but\r\ntwelve ships-of-the-line, besides £3,000,000 in money and merchandise\r\nbelonging to the Spanish king. The importance of Havana was not to be\r\nmeasured only by its own size, or its position as centre of a large\r\nand richly cultivated district; it was also the port commanding the\r\nonly passage by which the treasure and other ships could sail from the\r\nGulf of Mexico to Europe in those days. With Havana in an enemy's\r\nhands it would be necessary to assemble them at Cartagena and from\r\nthere beat up against the trade-winds,--an operation always difficult,\r\nand which would keep ships long in waters where they were exposed to\r\ncapture by English cruisers. Not even an attack upon the isthmus would\r\nhave been so serious a blow to Spain. This important result could only\r\nbe achieved by a nation confident of controlling the communications by\r\nits sea power, to which the happy issue must wholly be ascribed, and\r\nwhich had another signal illustration in the timely conveying of four\r\nthousand American troops to reinforce the English ranks, terribly\r\nwasted by battle and fever. It is said that only twenty-five hundred\r\nserviceable fighting men remained on foot when the city fell.\r\n\r\nWhile the long reach and vigor of England's sea power was thus felt in\r\nthe West Indies, it was receiving further illustration in Portugal and\r\nin the far East. The allied crowns in the beginning had invited\r\nPortugal to join their alliance against those whom they had taken to\r\ncalling the \"tyrants of the seas,\" reminding her how the English\r\nmonopoly of her trade was draining the country of gold, and recalling\r\nthe deliberate violation of her neutrality by the fleet under\r\nBoscawen. The Portuguese minister of the day well knew all this, and\r\nkeenly felt it; but though the invitation was accompanied by the plain\r\nstatement that Portugal would not be allowed to continue a neutrality\r\nshe could not enforce, he judged rightly that the country had more to\r\nfear from England and her fleet than from the Spanish army. The allies\r\ndeclared war and invaded Portugal. They were for a time successful;\r\nbut the \"tyrants of the seas\" answered Portugal's call, sent a fleet\r\nand landed at Lisbon eight thousand soldiers, who drove the Spaniards\r\nover the frontiers, and even carried the war into Spain itself.\r\n\r\nSimultaneous with these significant events, Manila was attacked. With\r\nso much already on hand, it was found impossible to spare troops or\r\nships from England. The successes in India and the absolute security\r\nof the establishments there, with the control of the sea, allowed the\r\nIndian officials themselves to undertake this colonial expedition. It\r\nsailed in August, 1762, and reaching Malacca on the 19th, was supplied\r\nat that neutral port with all that was needed for the siege about to\r\nbe undertaken; the Dutch, though jealous of the English advance, not\r\nventuring to refuse their demands. The expedition, which depended\r\nentirely upon the fleet, resulted in the whole group of Philippine\r\nIslands surrendering in October and paying a ransom of four million\r\ndollars. At about the same time the fleet captured the Acapulco\r\ngalleon having three million dollars on board, and an English squadron\r\nin the Atlantic took a treasure-ship from Lima with four million\r\ndollars in silver for the Spanish government.\r\n\r\n    \"Never had the colonial empire of Spain received such blows.\r\n    Spain, whose opportune intervention might have modified the fate\r\n    of the war, entered it too late to help France, but in time to\r\n    share her misfortunes. There was reason to fear yet more. Panama\r\n    and San Domingo were threatened, and the Anglo-Americans were\r\n    preparing for the invasion of Florida and Louisiana.... The\r\n    conquest of Havana had in great measure interrupted the\r\n    communications between the wealthy American colonies of Spain\r\n    and Europe. The reduction of the Philippine Islands now excluded\r\n    her from Asia. The two together severed all the avenues of\r\n    Spanish trade and cut off all intercourse between the parts of\r\n    their vast but disconnected empire.\"[107]\r\n\r\nThe selection of the points of attack, due to the ministry of Pitt,\r\nwas strategically good, cutting effectually the sinews of the enemy's\r\nstrength; and if his plans had been fully carried out and Panama also\r\nseized, the success would have been yet more decisive. England had\r\nlost also the advantage of the surprise he would have effected by\r\nanticipating Spain's declaration of war; but her arms were triumphant\r\nduring this short contest, through the rapidity with which her\r\nprojects were carried into execution, due to the state of efficiency\r\nto which her naval forces and administration had been brought.\r\n\r\nWith the conquest of Manila ended the military operations of the war.\r\nNine months, counting from the formal declaration by England in\r\nJanuary, had been sufficient to shatter the last hope of France, and\r\nto bring Spain to a peace in which was conceded every point on which\r\nshe had based her hostile attitude and demands. It seems scarcely\r\nnecessary, after even the brief summary of events that has been given,\r\nto point out that the speed and thoroughness with which England's work\r\nwas done was due wholly to her sea power, which allowed her forces to\r\nact on distant points, widely apart as Cuba, Portugal, India, and the\r\nPhilippines, without a fear of serious break in their communications.\r\n\r\nBefore giving the terms of peace which ought to summarize the results\r\nof the war, but do so imperfectly, owing to the weak eagerness of the\r\nEnglish ministry to conclude it, it is necessary to trace in outline\r\nthe effect of the war upon commerce, upon the foundations of sea power\r\nand national prosperity.\r\n\r\nOne prominent feature of this war may be more strongly impressed upon\r\nthe mind by a startling, because paradoxical, statement that the\r\nprosperity of the English is shown by the magnitude of their losses.\r\n\r\n    \"From 1756 to 1760,\" states a French historian, \"French\r\n    privateers captured from the English more than twenty-five\r\n    hundred merchantmen. In 1761, though France had not, so to\r\n    speak, a single ship-of-the-line at sea, and though the English\r\n    had taken two hundred and forty of our privateers, their\r\n    comrades still took eight hundred and twelve English vessels.\r\n    The explanation of the number of these prizes lies in the\r\n    prodigious growth of the English shipping. In 1760 it is claimed\r\n    that the English had at sea eight thousand sail; of these the\r\n    French captured nearly one tenth, despite escorts and cruisers.\r\n    In the four years from 1756 to 1760 the French lost only nine\r\n    hundred and fifty vessels.\"[108]\r\n\r\nBut this discrepancy is justly attributed by an English writer \"to the\r\ndiminution of the French commerce and the dread of falling into the\r\nhands of the English, which kept many of their trading-vessels from\r\ngoing to sea;\" and he goes on to point out that the capture of vessels\r\nwas not the principal benefit resulting from the efficiency of\r\nEngland's fleets. \"Captures like Duquesne, Louisburg, Prince Edward's\r\nIsland, the reduction of Senegal, and later on of Guadeloupe and\r\nMartinique, were events no less destructive to French commerce and\r\ncolonies than advantageous to those of England.\"[109] The\r\nmultiplication of French privateers was indeed a sad token to an\r\ninstructed eye, showing behind them merchant shipping in enforced\r\nidleness, whose crews and whose owners were driven to speculative\r\npillage in order to live. Nor was this risk wholly in vain. The same\r\nEnglishman confesses that in 1759 the losses of merchantmen showed a\r\nworse balance than the ships-of-war. While the French were striving in\r\nvain to regain equality upon the sea and repair their losses, but to\r\nno purpose, for \"in building and arming vessels they labored only for\r\nthe English fleet,\" yet, \"notwithstanding the courage and vigilance of\r\nEnglish cruisers, French privateers so swarmed that in this year they\r\ntook two hundred and forty British vessels, chiefly coasters and small\r\ncraft.\" In 1760 the same authority gives the British loss in\r\ntrading-vessels at over three hundred, and in 1761 at over eight\r\nhundred, three times that of the French; but he adds: \"It would not\r\nhave been wonderful had they taken more and richer ships. While their\r\ncommerce was nearly destroyed, and they had few merchant-ships at\r\nsea, the trading-fleets of England covered the seas. Every year her\r\ncommerce was increasing; the money which the war carried out was\r\nreturned by the produce of her industry. Eight thousand vessels were\r\nemployed by the traders of Great Britain.\" The extent of her losses is\r\nattributed to three causes, of which the first only was preventable:\r\n(1) The inattention of merchant-ships to the orders of the convoying\r\nvessels; (2) The immense number of English ships in all seas; (3) The\r\nenemy's venturing the whole remains of his strength in privateering.\r\nDuring the same year, 1761, the navy lost one ship-of-the-line, which\r\nwas retaken, and one cutter. At the same time, notwithstanding the\r\nvarious exchanges, the English still held twenty-five thousand French\r\nprisoners, while the English prisoners in France were but twelve\r\nhundred. These were the results of the sea war.\r\n\r\nFinally, in summing up the commercial condition of the kingdom at the\r\nend of the war, after mentioning the enormous sums of specie taken\r\nfrom Spain, the writer says:--\r\n\r\n    \"These strengthened trade and fostered industry. The remittances\r\n    for foreign subsidies were in great part paid by bills on\r\n    merchants settled abroad, who had the value of the drafts in\r\n    British manufactures. The trade of England increased gradually\r\n    every year, and such a scene of national prosperity while waging\r\n    a long, costly, and bloody war, was never before shown by any\r\n    people in the world.\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder, with such results to her commerce and such unvarying\r\nsuccess attending her arms, and seeing the practical annihilation of\r\nthe French navy, that the union of France and Spain, which was then\r\nlowering on her future and had once excited the fears of all Europe,\r\nwas now beheld by Great Britain alone without the smallest fear or\r\ndespondency. Spain was by her constitution and the distribution of her\r\nempire peculiarly open to the attack of a great sea people; and\r\nwhatever the views of the government of the day, Pitt and the nation\r\nsaw that the hour had come, which had been hoped for in vain in 1739,\r\nbecause then years of peace and the obstinate bias of a great\r\nminister had relaxed the muscles of her fleet. Now she but reached\r\nforth her hand and seized what she wished; nor could there have been\r\nany limit to her prey, had not the ministry again been untrue to the\r\ninterests of the country.\r\n\r\nThe position of Portugal with reference to Great Britain has been\r\nalluded to, but merits some special attention as instancing an element\r\nof sea power obtained not by colonies, but by alliance, whether\r\nnecessary or prudential. The commercial connection before spoken of\r\n\"was strengthened by the strongest political ties. The two kingdoms\r\nwere so situated as to have little to fear from each other, while they\r\nmight impart many mutual advantages. The harbors of Portugal gave\r\nshelter as well as supplies to the English fleet, while the latter\r\ndefended the rich trade of Portugal with Brazil. The antipathy between\r\nPortugal and Spain made it necessary for the former to have an ally,\r\nstrong yet distant. None is so advantageous in that way as England,\r\nwhich in her turn might, and always has, derived great advantages from\r\nPortugal in a war with any of the southern powers of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThis is an English view of a matter which to others looks somewhat\r\nlike an alliance between a lion and a lamb. To call a country with a\r\nfleet like England's \"distant\" from a small maritime nation like\r\nPortugal is an absurdity. England is, and yet more in those days was,\r\nwherever her fleet could go. The opposite view of the matter, showing\r\nequally the value of the alliance, was well set forth in the memorial\r\nby which, under the civil name of an invitation, the crowns of France\r\nand Spain ordered Portugal to declare against England.\r\n\r\nThe grounds of that memorial--namely, the unequal benefit to Portugal\r\nfrom the connection and the disregard of Portuguese neutrality--have\r\nalready been given. The King of Portugal refused to abandon the\r\nalliance, for the professed reason that it was ancient and wholly\r\ndefensive. To this the two crowns replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"The defensive alliance is actually an offensive one by the\r\n    situation of the Portuguese dominions and the nature of the\r\n    English power. The English squadrons cannot in all seasons keep\r\n    the sea, nor cruise on the principal coasts of France and Spain\r\n    for cutting off the navigation of the two countries, without the\r\n    ports and assistance of Portugal; and these islanders could not\r\n    insult all maritime Europe, if the whole riches of Portugal did\r\n    not pass through their hands, which furnishes them with the\r\n    means to make war and renders the alliance truly and properly\r\n    offensive.\"\r\n\r\nBetween the two arguments the logic of situation and power prevailed.\r\nPortugal found England nearer and more dangerous than Spain, and\r\nremained for generations of trial true to the alliance. This\r\nrelationship was as useful to England as any of her colonial\r\npossessions, depending of course upon the scene of the principal\r\noperations at any particular time.\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries of peace were signed at Fontainebleau, November 3,\r\n1762; the definitive treaty on the 10th of the following February, at\r\nParis, whence the peace takes its name.\r\n\r\nBy its terms France renounced all claims to Canada, Nova Scotia, and\r\nall the islands of the St. Lawrence; along with Canada she ceded the\r\nvalley of the Ohio and all her territory on the east side of the\r\nMississippi, except the city of New Orleans. At the same time Spain,\r\nas an equivalent for Havana, which England restored, yielded Florida,\r\nunder which name were comprised all her continental possessions east\r\nof the Mississippi. Thus England obtained a colonial empire embracing\r\nCanada, from Hudson's Bay, and all of the present United States east\r\nof the Mississippi. The possibilities of this vast region were then\r\nonly partially foreseen, and as yet there was no foreshadowing of the\r\nrevolt of the thirteen colonies.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies, England gave back to France the important islands\r\nof Guadeloupe and Martinique. The four so-called neutral islands of\r\nthe Lesser Antilles were divided between the two powers; Sta. Lucia\r\ngoing to France, St. Vincent, Tobago, and Dominica to England, which\r\nalso retained Grenada.\r\n\r\nMinorca was given back to England; and as the restoration of the\r\nisland to Spain had been one of the conditions of the alliance with\r\nthe latter, France, unable to fulfil her stipulation, ceded to Spain\r\nLouisiana west of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIn India, France recovered the possessions she had held before Dupleix\r\nbegan his schemes of aggrandizement; but she gave up the right of\r\nerecting fortifications or keeping troops in Bengal, and so left the\r\nstation at Chandernagore defenceless. In a word, France resumed her\r\nfacilities for trading, but practically abandoned her pretensions to\r\npolitical influence. It was tacitly understood that the English\r\ncompany would keep all its conquests.\r\n\r\nThe right of fishing upon the coasts of Newfoundland and in parts of\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence, which France had previously enjoyed, was\r\nconceded to her by this treaty; but it was denied to Spain, who had\r\nclaimed it for her fishermen. This concession was among those most\r\nattacked by the English opposition.\r\n\r\nThe nation at large and Pitt, the favorite of the nation, were\r\nbitterly opposed to the terms of the treaty. \"France,\" said Pitt, \"is\r\nchiefly formidable to us as a maritime and commercial power. What we\r\ngain in this respect is valuable to us above all through the injury to\r\nher which results from it. You leave to France the possibility of\r\nreviving her navy.\" In truth, from the point of view of sea power and\r\nof the national jealousies which the spirit of that age sanctioned,\r\nthese words, though illiberal, were strictly justifiable. The\r\nrestoration to France of her colonies in the West Indies and her\r\nstations in India, together with the valuable right of fishery in her\r\nformer American possessions, put before her the possibility and the\r\ninducement to restore her shipping, her commerce, and her navy, and\r\nthus tended to recall her from the path of continental ambition which\r\nhad been so fatal to her interests, and in the same proportion\r\nfavorable to the unprecedented growth of England's power upon the\r\nocean. The opposition, and indeed some of the ministry, also thought\r\nthat so commanding and important a position as Havana was poorly paid\r\nfor by the cession of the yet desolate and unproductive region called\r\nFlorida. Porto Rico was suggested, Florida accepted. There were other\r\nminor points of difference, into which it is unnecessary to enter. It\r\ncould scarcely be denied that with the commanding military control of\r\nthe sea held by England, grasping as she now did so many important\r\npositions, with her navy overwhelmingly superior in numbers, and her\r\ncommerce and internal condition very thriving, more rigorous terms\r\nmight easily have been exacted and would have been prudent. The\r\nministry defended their eagerness and spirit of concession on the\r\nground of the enormous growth of the debt, which then amounted to\r\n£122,000,000, a sum in every point of view much greater then than now;\r\nbut while this draft upon the future was fully justified by the\r\nsuccess of the war, it also imperatively demanded that the utmost\r\nadvantages which the military situation made attainable should be\r\nexacted. This the ministry failed to do. As regards the debt, it is\r\nwell observed by a French writer that \"in this war, and for years\r\nafterward, England had in view nothing less than the conquest of\r\nAmerica and the progress of her East India Company. By these two\r\ncountries her manufactures and commerce acquired more than sufficient\r\noutlets, and repaid her for the numerous sacrifices she had made.\r\nSeeing the maritime decay of Europe,--its commerce annihilated, its\r\nmanufactures so little advanced,--how could the English nation feel\r\nafraid of a future which offered so vast a perspective?\" Unfortunately\r\nthe nation needed an exponent in the government; and its chosen\r\nmouthpiece, the only man, perhaps, able to rise to the level of the\r\ngreat opportunity, was out of favor at court.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the gains of England were very great, not only in\r\nterritorial increase, nor yet in maritime preponderance, but in the\r\nprestige and position achieved in the eyes of the nations, now fully\r\nopened to her great resources and mighty power. To these results, won\r\nby the sea, the issue of the continental war offered a singular and\r\nsuggestive contrast. France had already withdrawn, along with\r\nEngland, from all share in that strife, and peace between the other\r\nparties to it was signed five days after the Peace of Paris. The terms\r\nof the peace were simply the _status quo ante bellum_. By the estimate\r\nof the King of Prussia, one hundred and eighty thousand of his\r\nsoldiers had fallen or died in this war, out of a kingdom of five\r\nmillion souls; while the losses of Russia, Austria, and France\r\naggregated four hundred and sixty thousand men. The result was simply\r\nthat things remained as they were.[110] To attribute this only to a\r\ndifference between the possibilities of land and sea war is of course\r\nabsurd. The genius of Frederick, backed by the money of England, had\r\nproved an equal match for the mismanaged and not always hearty efforts\r\nof a coalition numerically overwhelming. What does seem a fair\r\nconclusion is, that States having a good seaboard, or even ready\r\naccess to the ocean by one or two outlets, will find it to their\r\nadvantage to seek prosperity and extension by the way of the sea and\r\nof commerce, rather than in attempts to unsettle and modify existing\r\npolitical arrangements in countries where a more or less long\r\npossession of power has conferred acknowledged rights, and created\r\nnational allegiance or political ties. Since the Treaty of Paris in\r\n1763, the waste places of the world have been rapidly filled; witness\r\nour own continent, Australia, and even South America. A nominal and\r\nmore or less clearly defined political possession now generally exists\r\nin the most forsaken regions, though to this statement there are some\r\nmarked exceptions; but in many places this political possession is\r\nlittle more than nominal, and in others of a character so feeble that\r\nit cannot rely upon itself alone for support or protection. The\r\nfamiliar and notorious example of the Turkish Empire, kept erect only\r\nby the forces pressing upon it from opposing sides, by the mutual\r\njealousies of powers that have no sympathy with it, is an instance of\r\nsuch weak political tenure; and though the question is wholly\r\nEuropean, all know enough of it to be aware that the interest and\r\ncontrol of the sea powers is among the chief, if not the first, of the\r\nelements that now fix the situation; and that they, if intelligently\r\nused, will direct the future inevitable changes. Upon the western\r\ncontinents the political condition of the Central American and\r\ntropical South American States is so unstable as to cause constant\r\nanxiety about the maintenance of internal order, and seriously to\r\ninterfere with commerce and with the peaceful development of their\r\nresources. So long as--to use a familiar expression--they hurt no one\r\nbut themselves, this may go on; but for a long time the citizens of\r\nmore stable governments have been seeking to exploit their resources,\r\nand have borne the losses arising from their distracted condition.\r\nNorth America and Australia still offer large openings to immigration\r\nand enterprise; but they are filling up rapidly, and as the\r\nopportunities there diminish, the demand must arise for a more settled\r\ngovernment in those disordered States, for security to life and for\r\nreasonable stability of institutions enabling merchants and others to\r\ncount upon the future. There is certainly no present hope that such a\r\ndemand can be fulfilled from the existing native materials; if the\r\nsame be true when the demand arises, no theoretical positions, like\r\nthe Monroe doctrine, will prevent interested nations from attempting\r\nto remedy the evil by some measure, which, whatever it may be called,\r\nwill be a political interference. Such interferences must produce\r\ncollisions, which may be at times settled by arbitration, but can\r\nscarcely fail at other times to cause war. Even for a peaceful\r\nsolution, that nation will have the strongest arguments which has the\r\nstrongest organized force. It need scarcely be said that the\r\nsuccessful piercing of the Central American Isthmus at any point may\r\nprecipitate the moment that is sure to come sooner or later. The\r\nprofound modification of commercial routes expected from this\r\nenterprise, the political importance to the United States of such a\r\nchannel of communication between her Atlantic and Pacific seaboards,\r\nare not, however, the whole nor even the principal part of the\r\nquestion. As far as can be seen, the time will come when stable\r\ngovernments for the American tropical States must be assured by the\r\nnow existing powerful and stable States of America or Europe. The\r\ngeographical position of those States, the climatic conditions, make\r\nit plain at once that sea power will there, even more than in the case\r\nof Turkey, determine what foreign State shall predominate,--if not by\r\nactual possession, by its influence over the native governments. The\r\ngeographical position of the United States and her intrinsic power\r\ngive her an undeniable advantage; but that advantage will not avail if\r\nthere is a great inferiority of organized brute-force, which still\r\nremains the last argument of republics as of kings. Herein lies to us\r\nthe great and still living interest of the Seven Years' War. In it we\r\nhave seen and followed England, with an army small as compared with\r\nother States, as is still her case to-day, first successfully\r\ndefending her own shores, then carrying her arms in every direction,\r\nspreading her rule and influence over remote regions, and not only\r\nbinding them to her obedience, but making them tributary to her\r\nwealth, her strength, and her reputation. As she loosens the grasp and\r\nneutralizes the influence of France and Spain in regions beyond the\r\nsea, there is perhaps seen the prophecy of some other great nation in\r\ndays yet to come, that will incline the balance of power in some\r\nfuture sea war, whose scope will be recognized afterward, if not by\r\ncontemporaries, to have been the political future and the economical\r\ndevelopment of regions before lost to civilization; but that nation\r\nwill not be the United States if the moment find her indifferent, as\r\nnow, to the empire of the seas.\r\n\r\nThe direction then given to England's efforts, by the instinct of the\r\nnation and the fiery genius of Pitt, continued after the war, and has\r\nprofoundly influenced her subsequent policy. Mistress now of North\r\nAmerica, lording it in India, through the company whose territorial\r\nconquests had been ratified by native princes, over twenty millions of\r\ninhabitants,--a population larger than that of Great Britain and\r\nhaving a revenue respectable alongside of that of the home\r\ngovernment,--England, with yet other rich possessions scattered far\r\nand wide over the globe, had ever before her eyes, as a salutary\r\nlesson, the severe chastisement which the weakness of Spain had\r\nallowed her to inflict upon that huge disjointed empire. The words of\r\nthe English naval historian of that war, speaking about Spain, apply\r\nwith slight modifications to England in our own day.\r\n\r\n    \"Spain is precisely that power against which England can always\r\n    contend with the fairest prospect of advantage and honor. That\r\n    extensive monarchy is exhausted at heart, her resources lie at a\r\n    great distance, and whatever power commands the sea, may command\r\n    the wealth and commerce of Spain. The dominions from which she\r\n    draws her resources, lying at an immense distance from the\r\n    capital and from one another, make it more necessary for her\r\n    than for any other State to temporize, until she can inspire\r\n    with activity all parts of her enormous but disjointed\r\n    empire.\"[111]\r\n\r\nIt would be untrue to say that England is exhausted at heart; but her\r\ndependence upon the outside world is such as to give a certain\r\nsuggestiveness to the phrase.\r\n\r\nThis analogy of positions was not overlooked by England. From that\r\ntime forward up to our own day, the possessions won for her by her sea\r\npower have combined with that sea power itself to control her policy.\r\nThe road to India--in the days of Clive a distant and perilous voyage\r\non which she had not a stopping-place of her own--was reinforced as\r\nopportunity offered by the acquisition of St. Helena, of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, of the Mauritius. When steam made the Red Sea and\r\nMediterranean route practicable, she acquired Aden, and yet later has\r\nestablished herself at Socotra. Malta had already fallen into her\r\nhands during the wars of the French Revolution, and her commanding\r\nposition, as the corner-stone upon which the coalitions against\r\nNapoleon rested, enabled her to claim it at the Peace of 1815. Being\r\nbut a short thousand miles from Gibraltar, the circles of military\r\ncommand exercised by these two places intersect. The present day has\r\nseen the stretch from Malta to the Isthmus of Suez, formerly without a\r\nstation, guarded by the cession to her of Cyprus. Egypt, despite the\r\njealousy of France, has passed under English control. The importance\r\nof that position to India, understood by Napoleon and Nelson, led the\r\nlatter at once to send an officer overland to Bombay with the news of\r\nthe battle of the Nile and the downfall of Bonaparte's hopes. Even\r\nnow, the jealousy with which England views the advance of Russia in\r\nCentral Asia is the result of those days in which her sea power and\r\nresources triumphed over the weakness of D'Aché and the genius of\r\nSuffren, and wrenched the peninsula of India from the ambition of the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\n    \"For the first time since the Middle Ages,\" says M. Martin,\r\n    speaking of the Seven Years' War, \"England had conquered France\r\n    single-handed almost without allies, France having powerful\r\n    auxiliaries. She had conquered solely by the superiority of her\r\n    government.\"\r\n\r\nYes! but by the superiority of her government using the tremendous\r\nweapon of her sea power. This made her rich, and in turn protected the\r\ntrade by which she had her wealth. With her money she upheld her few\r\nauxiliaries, mainly Prussia and Hanover, in their desperate strife.\r\nHer power was everywhere that her ships could reach, and there was\r\nnone to dispute the sea to her. Where she would she went, and with her\r\nwent her guns and her troops. By this mobility her forces were\r\nmultiplied, those of her enemies distracted. Ruler of the seas, she\r\neverywhere obstructed its highways. The enemies' fleets could not\r\njoin; no great fleet could get out, or if it did, it was only to meet\r\nat once, with uninured officers and crews, those who were veterans in\r\ngales and warfare. Save in the case of Minorca, she carefully held her\r\nown sea-bases and eagerly seized those of the enemy. What a lion in\r\nthe path was Gibraltar to the French squadrons of Toulon and Brest!\r\nWhat hope for French succor to Canada, when the English fleet had\r\nLouisburg under its lee?\r\n\r\nThe one nation that gained in this war was that which used the sea in\r\npeace to earn its wealth, and ruled it in war by the extent of its\r\nnavy, by the number of its subjects who lived on the sea or by the\r\nsea, and by its numerous bases of operations scattered over the globe.\r\nYet it must be observed that these bases themselves would have lost\r\ntheir value if their communications remained obstructed. Therefore the\r\nFrench lost Louisburg, Martinique, Pondicherry; so England herself\r\nlost Minorca. The service between the bases and the mobile force\r\nbetween the ports and the fleets is mutual.[112] In this respect the\r\nnavy is essentially a light corps; it keeps open the communications\r\nbetween its own ports, it obstructs those of the enemy; but it sweeps\r\nthe sea for the service of the land, it controls the desert that man\r\nmay live and thrive on the habitable globe.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[93] That is, with the guns on board, but for the most part not\r\nmounted on their carriages, in order to give increased accommodation\r\nfor troops. When the troops were landed, the guns were mounted.\r\n\r\n[94] Ramatuelle: Tactique Navale.\r\n\r\n[95] Lapeyrouse-Bonfils: Hist. de la Marine.\r\n\r\n[96] Clerk: Naval Tactics.\r\n\r\n[97] Jurien de la Gravière: Guerres Maritimes.\r\n\r\n[98] Mahon: History of England.\r\n\r\n[99] Mahon: History of England.\r\n\r\n[100] For these, see Troude: Batailles Navales.\r\n\r\n[101] See Plate VIII.\r\n\r\n[102] Troude: Batailles Navales de la France.\r\n\r\n[103] Lapeyrouse-Bonfils.\r\n\r\n[104] Mahon: History of England.\r\n\r\n[105] Campbell: Lives of the Admirals.\r\n\r\n[106] Mahon: History of England.\r\n\r\n[107] Martin: History of France.\r\n\r\n[108] Martin: History of France.\r\n\r\n[109] Campbell: Lives of the Admirals.\r\n\r\n[110] See Annual Register, 1762, p. 63\r\n\r\n[111] Campbell: Lives of the Admirals.\r\n\r\n[112] These remarks, always true, are doubly so now since the\r\nintroduction of steam. The renewal of coal is a want more frequent,\r\nmore urgent, more peremptory, than any known to the sailing-ship. It\r\nis vain to look for energetic naval operations distant from coal\r\nstations. It is equally vain to acquire distant coaling stations\r\nwithout maintaining a powerful navy; they will but fall into the hands\r\nof the enemy. But the vainest of all delusions is the expectation of\r\nbringing down an enemy by commerce-destroying alone, with no coaling\r\nstations outside the national boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n    COURSE OF EVENTS FROM THE PEACE OF PARIS TO 1778.--MARITIME WAR\r\n    CONSEQUENT UPON THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.--SEA BATTLE OFF USHANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf England had reason to complain that she had not reaped from the\r\nTreaty of Paris all the advantages that her military achievements and\r\nposition entitled her to expect, France had every cause for discontent\r\nat the position in which the war left her. The gain of England was\r\nnearly measured by her losses; even the cession of Florida, made to\r\nthe conqueror by Spain, had been bought by France at the price of\r\nLouisiana. Naturally the thoughts of her statesmen and of her people,\r\nas they bent under the present necessity to bear the burden of the\r\nvanquished, turned to the future with its possibilities of revenge and\r\ncompensation. The Duc de Choiseul, able though imperious, remained for\r\nmany years more at the head of affairs, and worked persistently to\r\nrestore the power of France from the effects of the treaty. The\r\nAustrian alliance had been none of his seeking; it was already made\r\nand working when he came to office in 1758; but he had even at the\r\nfirst recognized that the chief enemy was England, and tried as far as\r\ncould be to direct the forces of the nation against her. The defeat of\r\nConflans having thwarted his projects of invasion, he next sought, in\r\nentire consistency with his main purpose, to stir up Spain and gain\r\nher alliance. The united efforts of the two kingdoms with their fine\r\nseaboards could, under good administration and with time for\r\npreparation, put afloat a navy that would be a fair counterpoise to\r\nthat of England. It was also doubtless true that weaker maritime\r\nStates, if they saw such a combination successfully made and working\r\nefficiently, would pluck up heart to declare against a government\r\nwhose greatness excited envy and fear, and which acted with the\r\ndisregard to the rights and welfare of others common to all\r\nuncontrolled power. Unhappily for both France and Spain, the alliance\r\ncame too late. The virtual annihilation of the French fleet in 1759\r\nwas indeed followed by an outburst of national enthusiasm for the\r\nnavy, skilfully fostered and guided by Choiseul. \"Popular feeling took\r\nup the cry, from one end of France to the other, 'The navy must be\r\nrestored.' Gifts of cities, corporations, and private individuals\r\nraised funds. A prodigious activity sprang up in the lately silent\r\nports; everywhere ships were building and repairing.\" The minister\r\nalso recognized the need of restoring the discipline and tone, as well\r\nas the material of the navy. The hour, however, was too late; the\r\nmiddle of a great and unsuccessful war is no time to begin\r\npreparations. \"Better late than never\" is not so safe a proverb as \"In\r\ntime of peace prepare for war.\" The condition of Spain was better.\r\nWhen war broke out, the English naval historian estimates that she had\r\none hundred ships of all sizes; of these, probably sixty were of the\r\nline. Nevertheless, although the addition of Spain to her numerous\r\nenemies might make the position of England seem critical, the\r\ncombination in her favor of numbers, skill, experience, and prestige,\r\nwas irresistible. With seventy thousand veteran seamen, she had only\r\nto maintain a position already won. The results we know.\r\n\r\nAfter the peace, Choiseul wisely remained faithful to his own first\r\nideas. The restoration of the navy continued, and was accompanied and\r\nfurthered by a spirit of professional ambition and of desire to excel,\r\namong the officers of the navy, which has been before mentioned, and\r\nwhich, in the peculiar condition of the United States navy at the\r\npresent day, may be commended as a model. The building of ships-of-war\r\ncontinued with great activity and on a large scale. At the end of the\r\nwar, thanks to the movement begun in 1761, there were forty\r\nships-of-the-line in good condition. In 1770, when Choiseul was\r\ndismissed, the royal navy numbered sixty-four of the line and fifty\r\nfrigates afloat. The arsenals and storehouses were filled, and a stock\r\nof ship-timber laid up. At the same time the minister tried to improve\r\nthe efficiency of the officers by repressing the arrogant spirit of\r\nthose of noble birth, which showed itself both toward superiors and\r\ntoward another order of officers, not of the nobility, whose abilities\r\nmade them desired on board the fleet. This class-feeling carried with\r\nit a curious sentiment of equality among officers of very different\r\ngrades, which injuriously affected the spirit of subordination.\r\nMembers, all, of a privileged social order, their equality as such was\r\nmore clearly recognized than their inequality as junior and senior.\r\nThe droll story told by Marryatt of the midshipman, who represented to\r\nhis captain that a certain statement had been made in confidence,\r\nseems to have had a realization on the French quarter-deck of that\r\nday. \"Confidence!\" cried the captain; \"who ever heard of confidence\r\nbetween a post-captain and a midshipman!\" \"No sir,\" replied the\r\nyoungster, \"not between a captain and a midshipman, but between two\r\ngentlemen.\" Disputes, arguments, suggestions, between two gentlemen,\r\nforgetful of their relative rank, would break out at critical moments,\r\nand the feeling of equality, which wild democratic notions spread\r\nthroughout the fleets of the republic, was curiously forestalled by\r\nthat existing among the members of a most haughty aristocracy. \"I saw\r\nby his face,\" says one of Marryatt's heroes, \"that the first\r\nlieutenant did not agree with the captain; but he was too good an\r\nofficer to say so at such a moment.\" The phrase expresses one of the\r\ndeepest-rooted merits of the English system, the want of which is\r\nowned by French writers:--\r\n\r\n    \"Under Louis XVI. the intimacy and fellowship existing between\r\n    the chief and the subordinate led the latter to discuss the\r\n    orders which were given him.... The relaxation of discipline and\r\n    the spirit of independence were due also to another cause than\r\n    that pointed out; they can be partly attributed to the\r\n    regulation of the officers' messes. Admiral, captain, officers,\r\n    midshipmen, ate together; everything was in common. They\r\n    thee-and-thou'd each other like chums. In handling the ship, the\r\n    inferior gave his opinion, argued, and the chief, irritated,\r\n    often preferred to yield rather than make enemies. Facts of this\r\n    kind are asserted by witnesses whose truthfulness is above\r\n    suspicion.\"[113]\r\n\r\nInsubordination of this character, to which weaker men gave way,\r\ndashed in vain against the resolute and fiery temper of Suffren; but\r\nthe spirit of discontent rose almost to the height of mutiny, causing\r\nhim to say in his despatches to the minister of the navy, after his\r\nfourth battle: \"My heart is pierced by the most general defection. It\r\nis frightful to think that I might four times have destroyed the\r\nEnglish fleet, and that it still exists.\" Choiseul's reforms broke\r\nagainst this rock, which only the uprising of the whole nation finally\r\nremoved; but in the personnel of the crews a great improvement was\r\nmade. In 1767 he reorganized the artillery of the fleet, forming a\r\nbody of ten thousand gunners, who were systematically drilled once a\r\nweek during the ten years still to intervene before the next war with\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nLosing sight of no part of his plans, Choiseul, while promoting the\r\nnaval and military power of France, paid special attention to the\r\nalliance with Spain and judiciously encouraged and furthered the\r\nefforts of that country in the path of progress under Charles III.,\r\nthe best of her kings of the Bourbon line. The Austrian alliance still\r\nexisting was maintained, but his hopes were chiefly fixed upon Spain.\r\nThe wisdom and insight which had at once fastened upon England as the\r\ncentre of enmity to France had been justified and further enlightened\r\nby the whole course of the Seven Years' War. In Spain was the surest,\r\nand, with good administration, the most powerful ally. The close\r\nproximity of the two countries, the relative positions of their ports,\r\nmade the naval situation particularly strong; and the alliance which\r\nwas dictated by sound policy, by family ties, and by just fear of\r\nEngland's sea power, was further assured to France by recent and still\r\nexisting injuries that must continue to rankle with Spain. Gibraltar,\r\nMinorca, and Florida were still in the hands of England; no Spaniard\r\ncould be easy till this reproach was wiped out.\r\n\r\nIt may be readily believed, as is asserted by French historians, that\r\nEngland viewed with disquietude the growth of the French navy, and\r\nwould gladly have nipped it betimes; but it is more doubtful whether\r\nshe would have been willing to force a war for that purpose. During\r\nthe years succeeding the Peace of Paris a succession of short\r\nministries, turning mainly upon questions of internal policy or\r\nunimportant party arrangement, caused her foreign policy to present a\r\nmarked contrast to the vigorous, overbearing, but straightforward path\r\nfollowed by Pitt. Internal commotions, such as are apt to follow great\r\nwars, and above all the controversy with the North American colonies,\r\nwhich began as early as 1765 with the well-known Stamp Act, conspired\r\nwith other causes to stay the hand of England. Twice at least during\r\nthe years of Choiseul's ministry there occurred opportunities which a\r\nresolute, ready, and not too scrupulous government might easily have\r\nconverted into a cause of war; the more so as they involved that sea\r\npower which is to England above all other nations the object of just\r\nand jealous concern. In 1764 the Genoese, weary of their unsuccessful\r\nattempts to control Corsica, again asked France to renew the\r\noccupation of the ports which had been garrisoned by her in 1756. The\r\nCorsicans also sent an ambassador to France in order to solicit\r\nrecognition of the independence of the island, in consideration of a\r\ntribute equivalent to that which they had formerly paid to Genoa. The\r\nlatter, feeling its inability to reconquer the island, at length\r\ndecided practically to cede it. The transaction took the shape of a\r\nformal permission for the King of France to exercise all the rights of\r\nsovereignty over all the places and harbors of Corsica, as security\r\nfor debts owing to him by the republic. This cession, disguised under\r\nthe form of a security in order to palliate the aggrandizement of\r\nFrance in the eyes of Austria and England, recalls the conditional and\r\nthinly veiled surrender of Cyprus to England nine years ago,--a\r\ntransfer likely to be as final and far-reaching as that of Corsica.\r\nEngland then remonstrated and talked angrily; but though Burke said,\r\n\"Corsica as a province of France is terrible to me,\" only one member\r\nof the House of Commons, the veteran admiral Sir Charles Saunders, was\r\nfound to say \"that it would be better to go to war with France than\r\nconsent to her taking possession of Corsica.\"[114] Having in view the\r\nthen well-recognized interests of England in the Mediterranean, it is\r\nevident that an island so well situated as Corsica for influencing the\r\nshores of Italy and checking the naval station at Minorca, would not\r\nhave been allowed to go into the hands of a strong master, if the\r\nnation had felt ready and willing for war.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1770, a dispute arose between England and Spain relative to\r\nthe possession of the Falkland Islands. It is not material to state\r\nthe nature of either claim to what was then but a collection of barren\r\nislands, destitute of military as well as of natural advantages. Both\r\nEngland and Spain had had a settlement, on which the national colors\r\nwere flying; and at the English station a captain in the navy\r\ncommanded. Before this settlement, called Port Egmont, there suddenly\r\nappeared, in June, 1770, a Spanish expedition, fitted out in Buenos\r\nAyres, of five frigates and sixteen hundred soldiers. To such a force\r\nthe handful of Englishmen could make no serious resistance; so after a\r\nfew shots, exchanged for the honor of the flag, they capitulated.\r\n\r\nThe news of this transaction, which reached England in the following\r\nOctober, showed by its reception how much more serious is an insult\r\nthan an injury, and how much more bitterly resented. The transfer of\r\nCorsica had scarcely occasioned a stir outside the offices of\r\nstatesmen; the attack on Port Egmont roused the people and Parliament.\r\nThe minister to Madrid was ordered to demand the immediate restoration\r\nof the islands, with a disavowal of the action of the officer who had\r\nordered the attack. Without waiting for a reply, ships were ordered\r\ninto commission, press-gangs swept the streets, and in a short time a\r\npowerful fleet was ready at Spithead to revenge the insult. Spain,\r\nrelying upon the Bourbon family compact and the support of France, was\r\ndisposed to stand firm; but the old king, Louis XV., was averse to\r\nwar, and Choiseul, among whose enemies at court was the last mistress,\r\nwas dismissed. With his fall disappeared the hopes of Spain, which at\r\nonce complied with the demands of England, reserving, however, the\r\nquestion as to the rights of sovereignty. This conclusion shows\r\nclearly that England, though still wielding an effective sea power\r\nable to control Spain, was not eager for a war merely in order to\r\nbreak down the rival navies.\r\n\r\nIt is not wholly alien to the question of sea power to note, without\r\ndwelling upon it, a great event which now happened, seemingly utterly\r\nremoved from all relation to the sea. The first partition of Poland\r\nbetween Prussia, Russia, and Austria, carried out in 1772, was made\r\neasier by the preoccupation of Choiseul with his naval policy and the\r\nSpanish alliance. The friendship and support of Poland and Turkey, as\r\nchecks upon the House of Austria, were part of the tradition received\r\nfrom Henry IV. and Richelieu; the destruction of the former was a\r\ndirect blow to the pride and interest of France. What Choiseul would\r\nhave done had he been in office, cannot be known; but if the result of\r\nthe Seven Years' War had been different, France might have interfered\r\nto some purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of May, 1774, Louis XV. died, at the time when the\r\ntroubles in the North American colonies were fast coming to a head.\r\nUnder his youthful successor, Louis XVI., the policy of peace on the\r\ncontinent, of friendly alliance with Spain, and of building up the\r\nnavy in numbers and efficiency, was continued. This was the foreign\r\npolicy of Choiseul, directed against the sea power of England as the\r\nchief enemy, and toward the sea power of France as the chief support,\r\nof the nation. The instructions which, according to a French naval\r\nauthor, the new king gave to his ministers show the spirit with which\r\nhis reign up to the Revolution was inspired, whether or not they\r\noriginated with the king himself:--\r\n\r\n    \"To watch all indications of approaching danger; to observe by\r\n    cruisers the approaches to our islands and the entrance to the\r\n    Gulf of Mexico; to keep track of what was passing on the banks\r\n    of Newfoundland, and to follow the tendencies of English\r\n    commerce; to observe in England the state of the troops and\r\n    armaments, the public credit and the ministry; to meddle\r\n    adroitly in the affairs of the British colonies; to give the\r\n    insurgent colonists the means of obtaining supplies of war,\r\n    while maintaining the strictest neutrality; to develop actively,\r\n    but noiselessly, the navy; to repair our ships of war; to fill\r\n    our storehouses and to keep on hand the means for rapidly\r\n    equipping a fleet at Brest and at Toulon, while Spain should be\r\n    fitting one at Ferrol; finally, at the first serious fear of\r\n    rupture, to assemble numerous troops upon the shores of Brittany\r\n    and Normandy, and get everything ready for an invasion of\r\n    England, so as to force her to concentrate her forces, and thus\r\n    restrict her means of resistance at the extremities of the\r\n    empire.\"[115]\r\n\r\nSuch instructions, whether given all at once as a symmetrical,\r\nwell-thought-out plan, or from time to time, as occasion arose, showed\r\nthat an accurate forecast of the situation had been made, and breathed\r\na conviction which, if earlier felt, would have greatly modified the\r\nhistory of the two countries. The execution was less thorough than the\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of developing the navy, however, fifteen years of peace\r\nand steady work showed good results. When war openly broke out in\r\n1778, France had eighty ships-of-the-line in good condition, and\r\nsixty-seven thousand seamen were borne on the rolls of the maritime\r\nconscription. Spain, when she entered the war in 1779 as the ally of\r\nFrance, had in her ports nearly sixty ships-of-the-line. To this\r\ncombination England opposed a total number of two hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight ships of all classes, of which about one hundred and\r\nfifty were of the line. The apparent equality in material which would\r\nresult from these numbers was affected, to the disadvantage of\r\nEngland, by the superior size and artillery of the French and\r\nSpaniards; but on the other hand her strength was increased by the\r\nunity of aim imparted by belonging to one nation. The allies were\r\ndestined to feel the proverbial weakness of naval coalitions, as well\r\nas the degenerate administration of Spain, and the lack of habit--may\r\nit not even be said without injustice, of aptitude for the sea--of\r\nboth nations. The naval policy with which Louis XVI. began his reign\r\nwas kept up to the end; in 1791, two years after the assembly of the\r\nStates-General, the French navy numbered eighty-six ships-of-the-line,\r\ngenerally superior, both in dimensions and model, to English ships of\r\nthe same class.\r\n\r\nWe have come, therefore, to the beginning of a truly maritime war;\r\nwhich, as will be granted by those who have followed this narrative,\r\nhad not been seen since the days of De Ruyter and Tourville. The\r\nmagnificence of sea power and its value had perhaps been more clearly\r\nshown by the uncontrolled sway, and consequent exaltation, of one\r\nbelligerent; but the lesson thus given, if more striking, is less\r\nvividly interesting than the spectacle of that sea power meeting a foe\r\nworthy of its steel, and excited to exertion by a strife which\r\nendangered, not only its most valuable colonies, but even its own\r\nshores. Waged, from the extended character of the British Empire, in\r\nall quarters of the world at once, the attention of the student is\r\ncalled now to the East Indies and now to the West; now to the shores\r\nof the United States and thence to those of England; from New York and\r\nChesapeake Bay to Gibraltar and Minorca, to the Cape Verde Islands,\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, and Ceylon. Fleets now meet fleets of equal\r\nsize, and the general chase and the _mêlée_, which marked the actions\r\nof Hawke, Boscawen, and Anson, though they still occur at times, are\r\nfor the most part succeeded by wary and complicated manoeuvres, too\r\noften barren of decisive results as naval battles, which are the\r\nprevailing characteristic of this coming war. The superior tactical\r\nscience of the French succeeded in imparting to this conflict that\r\npeculiar feature of their naval policy, which subordinated the control\r\nof the sea by the destruction of the enemy's fleets, of his organized\r\nnaval forces, to the success of particular operations, the retention\r\nof particular points, the carrying out of particular ulterior\r\nstrategic ends. It is not necessary to endeavor to force upon others\r\nthe conviction of the present writer that such a policy, however\r\napplicable as an exception, is faulty as a rule; but it is most\r\ndesirable that all persons responsible for the conduct of naval\r\naffairs should recognize that the two lines of policy, in direct\r\ncontradiction to each other, do exist. In the one there is a strict\r\nanalogy to a war of posts; while in the other the objective is that\r\nforce whose destruction leaves the posts unsupported and therefore\r\nsure to fall in due time. These opposing policies being recognized,\r\nconsideration should also be had of the results of the two as\r\nexemplified in the history of England and France.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, with such cautious views that the new king at\r\nfirst sought to impress his admirals. In the instructions addressed to\r\nthe Count d'Orvilliers, commanding the first fleet sent out from\r\nBrest, the minister, speaking in the name of the king, says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your duty now is to restore to the French flag the lustre with\r\n    which it once shone; past misfortunes and faults must be buried\r\n    out of sight; only by the most illustrious actions can the navy\r\n    hope to succeed in doing this. His Majesty has the right to\r\n    expect the greatest efforts from his officers.... Under whatever\r\n    circumstances the king's fleet may be placed, his Majesty's\r\n    orders, which he expressly charges me to impress upon you, as\r\n    well as upon all officers in command, are that his ships attack\r\n    with the greatest vigor, and defend themselves, on all\r\n    occasions, to the last extremity.\"\r\n\r\nMore follows to the same effect; upon which a French officer, who has\r\nnot before been quoted in connection with this phase of French naval\r\npolicy, says:--\r\n\r\n    \"How different this language from that held to our admirals\r\n    during the last war; for it would be an error to believe that\r\n    they followed by choice and temper the timid and defensive\r\n    system which predominated in the tactics of the navy. The\r\n    government, always finding the expenses exacted by the\r\n    employment of the navy excessive, too often prescribed to its\r\n    admirals to keep the sea as long as possible without coming to\r\n    pitched battles, or even to brushes, generally very expensive,\r\n    and from which might follow the loss of ships difficult to\r\n    replace. Often they were enjoined, if driven to accept action,\r\n    carefully to avoid compromising the fate of their squadron by\r\n    too decisive encounters. They thought themselves, therefore,\r\n    obliged to retreat as soon as an engagement took too serious a\r\n    turn. Thus they acquired the unhappy habit of voluntarily\r\n    yielding the field of battle as soon as an enemy, even inferior,\r\n    boldly disputed it with them. Thus to send a fleet to meet the\r\n    enemy, only to retire shamefully from his presence; to receive\r\n    action instead of offering it; to begin battles only to end them\r\n    with the semblance of defeat; to ruin moral force in order to\r\n    save physical force,--that was the spirit which, as has been\r\n    very judiciously said by M. Charles Dupin, guided the French\r\n    ministry of that epoch. The results are known.\"[116]\r\n\r\nThe brave words of Louis XVI. were followed almost immediately by\r\nothers, of different and qualifying tenor, to Admiral d'Orvilliers\r\nbefore he sailed. He was informed that the king, having learned the\r\nstrength of the English fleet, relied upon his prudence as to the\r\nconduct to be followed at a moment when he had under his orders all\r\nthe naval force of which France could dispose. As a matter of fact the\r\ntwo fleets were nearly equal; it would be impossible to decide which\r\nwas the stronger, without detailed information as to the armament of\r\nevery ship. D'Orvilliers found himself, as many a responsible man has\r\nbefore, with two sets of orders, on one or the other of which he was\r\nsure to be impaled, if unlucky; while the government, in the same\r\nevent, was sure of a scape-goat.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the relative force of the two navies, material\r\nand moral, has necessarily carried us beyond the date of the opening\r\nof the American Revolutionary War. Before beginning with that\r\nstruggle, it may be well to supplement the rough estimate of England's\r\ntotal naval force, given, in lack of more precise information, by the\r\nstatement of the First Lord of the Admiralty made in the House of\r\nLords in November, 1777, a very few months before the war with France\r\nbegan. Replying to a complaint of the opposition as to the smallness\r\nof the Channel fleet, he said:--\r\n\r\n    \"We have now forty-two ships-of-the-line in commission in Great\r\n    Britain (without counting those on foreign service), thirty-five\r\n    of which are completely manned, and ready for sea at a moment's\r\n    warning.... I do not believe that either France or Spain\r\n    entertains any hostile disposition toward us; but from what I\r\n    have now submitted to you, I am authorized to affirm that our\r\n    navy is more than a match for that of the whole House of\r\n    Bourbon.\"[117]\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be said that this pleasing prospect was not realized\r\nby Admiral Keppel when appointed to command in the following March,\r\nand looking at his fleet with (to use his own apt expression) \"a\r\nseaman's eye;\"[118] and in June he went to sea with only twenty ships.\r\n\r\nIt is plainly undesirable to insert in a narrative of this character\r\nany account of the political questions which led to the separation of\r\nthe United States from the British Empire. It has already been\r\nremarked that the separation followed upon a succession of blunders by\r\nthe English ministry,--not unnatural in view of the ideas generally\r\nprevalent at that day as to the relations of colonies to the\r\nmother-country. It needed a man of commanding genius to recognize, not\r\nonly the substantial justice of the American claims,--many did\r\nthat,--but also the military strength of their situation, as before\r\nindicated. This lay in the distance of the colonies from home, their\r\nnearness to each other independently of the command of the sea, the\r\ncharacter of the colonists,--mainly of English and Dutch stock,--and\r\nthe probable hostility of France and Spain. Unfortunately for England,\r\nthe men most able to cope with the situation were in the minority and\r\nout of office.\r\n\r\nIt has been said before that, had the thirteen colonies been islands,\r\nthe sea power of Great Britain would have so completely isolated them\r\nthat their fall, one after the other, must have ensued. To this it may\r\nbe added that the narrowness of the strip then occupied by civilized\r\nman, and the manner in which it was intersected by estuaries of the\r\nsea and navigable rivers, practically reduced to the condition of\r\nislands, so far as mutual support went, great sections of the\r\ninsurgent country, which were not large enough to stand alone, yet too\r\nlarge for their fall not to have been a fatal blow to the common\r\ncause. The most familiar case is that of the line of the Hudson, where\r\nthe Bay of New York was held from the first by the British, who also\r\ntook the city in September, 1776, two months after the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. The difficulties in the way of moving up and down such a\r\nstream were doubtless much greater to sailing vessels than they now\r\nare to steamers; yet it seems impossible to doubt that active and\r\ncapable men wielding the great sea power of England could so have held\r\nthat river and Lake Champlain with ships-of-war at intervals and\r\naccompanying galleys as to have supported a sufficient army moving\r\nbetween the head-waters of the Hudson and the lake, while themselves\r\npreventing any intercourse by water between New England and the States\r\nwest of the river. This operation would have closely resembled that by\r\nwhich in the Civil War the United States fleets and armies gradually\r\ncut in twain the Southern Confederacy by mastering the course of the\r\nMississippi, and the political results would have been even more\r\nimportant than the military; for at that early stage of the war the\r\nspirit of independence was far more general and bitter in the section\r\nthat would have been cut off,--in New England,--than in New York and\r\nNew Jersey, perhaps than anywhere except in South Carolina.[119]\r\n\r\nIn 1777 the British attempted to accomplish this object by sending\r\nGeneral Burgoyne from Canada to force his way by Lake Champlain to the\r\nHudson. At the same time Sir Henry Clinton moved north from New York\r\nwith three thousand men, and reached West Point, whence he sent by\r\nshipping a part of his force up the river to within forty miles of\r\nAlbany. Here the officer in command learned of the surrender of\r\nBurgoyne at Saratoga, and returned; but what he did at the head of a\r\ndetachment from a main body of only three thousand, shows what might\r\nhave been done under a better system. While this was happening on the\r\nHudson, the English commander-in-chief of the troops acting in America\r\nhad curiously enough made use of the sea power of his nation to\r\ntransport the bulk of his army--fourteen thousand men--from New York\r\nto the head of Chesapeake Bay, so as to take Philadelphia in the rear.\r\nThis eccentric movement was successful as regarded its objective,\r\nPhiladelphia; but it was determined by political considerations,\r\nbecause Philadelphia was the seat of Congress, and was contrary to\r\nsound military policy. The conquest therefore was early lost; but it\r\nwas yet more dearly won, for by this diversion of the British forces\r\nthe different corps were placed out of mutual support, and the control\r\nof the water-line of the Hudson was abandoned. While Burgoyne, with\r\nseven thousand regular troops, besides auxiliaries, was moving down to\r\nseize the head-waters of the river, fourteen thousand men were removed\r\nfrom its mouth to the Chesapeake. The eight thousand left in or near\r\nNew York were consequently tied to the city by the presence of the\r\nAmerican army in New Jersey. This disastrous step was taken in August;\r\nin October Burgoyne, isolated and hemmed in, surrendered. In the\r\nfollowing May the English evacuated Philadelphia, and after a painful\r\nand perilous march through New Jersey, with Washington's army in close\r\npursuit, regained New York.\r\n\r\nThis taking of the British fleet to the head of the Chesapeake,\r\ncoupled with the ascent of the Potomac in 1814 by English\r\nsailing-frigates, shows another weak line in the chain of the American\r\ncolonies; but it was not, like that of the Hudson and Champlain, a\r\nline both ends of which rested in the enemy's power,--in Canada on the\r\none hand, on the sea on the other.\r\n\r\nAs to the sea warfare in general, it is needless to enlarge upon the\r\nfact that the colonists could make no head against the fleets of Great\r\nBritain, and were consequently forced to abandon the sea to them,\r\nresorting only to a cruising warfare, mainly by privateers, for which\r\ntheir seamanship and enterprise well fitted them, and by which they\r\ndid much injury to English commerce. By the end of 1778 the English\r\nnaval historian estimates that American privateers had taken nearly a\r\nthousand merchant-ships, valued at nearly £2,000,000; he claims,\r\nhowever, that the losses of the Americans were heavier. They should\r\nhave been; for the English cruisers were both better supported and\r\nindividually more powerful, while the extension of American commerce\r\nhad come to be the wonder of the statesmen of the mother-country. When\r\nthe war broke out, it was as great as that of England herself at the\r\nbeginning of the century.\r\n\r\nAn interesting indication of the number of the seafaring population of\r\nNorth America at that time is given by the statement in Parliament by\r\nthe First Lord of the Admiralty, \"that the navy had lost eighteen\r\nthousand of the seamen employed in the last war by not having\r\nAmerica,\"[120]--no inconsiderable loss to a sea power, particularly if\r\ncarried over to the ranks of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe course of warfare on the sea gave rise, as always, to grievances\r\nof neutrals against the English for the seizures of their ships in the\r\nAmerican trade. Such provocation, however, was not necessary to\r\nexcite the enmity and the hopes of France in the harassed state of the\r\nBritish government. The hour of reckoning, of vengeance, at which the\r\npolicy of Choiseul had aimed, seemed now at hand. The question was\r\nearly entertained at Paris what attitude should be assumed, what\r\nadvantage drawn from the revolt of the colonies. It was decided that\r\nthe latter should receive all possible support short of an actual\r\nbreak with England; and to this end a Frenchman named Beaumarchais was\r\nfurnished with money to establish a business house which should supply\r\nthe colonists with warlike stores. France gave a million francs, to\r\nwhich Spain added an equal sum, and Beaumarchais was allowed to buy\r\nfrom government arsenals. Meanwhile agents were received from the\r\nUnited States, and French officers passed into its service with little\r\nreal hindrance from their government. Beaumarchais' house was started\r\nin 1776; in December of that year Benjamin Franklin landed in France,\r\nand in May, 1777, Lafayette came to America. Meanwhile the\r\npreparations for war, especially for a sea war, were pushed on; the\r\nnavy was steadily increased, and arrangements were made for\r\nthreatening an invasion from the Channel, while the real scene of the\r\nwar was to be in the colonies. There France was in the position of a\r\nman who has little to lose. Already despoiled of Canada, she had every\r\nreason to believe that a renewal of war, with Europe neutral and the\r\nAmericans friends instead of enemies, would not rob her of her\r\nislands. Recognizing that the Americans, who less than twenty years\r\nbefore had insisted upon the conquest of Canada, would not consent to\r\nher regaining it, she expressly stipulated that she would have no such\r\nhopes, but exacted that in the coming war she should retain any\r\nEnglish West Indian possessions which she could seize. Spain was\r\ndifferently situated. Hating England, wanting to regain Gibraltar,\r\nMinorca, and Jamaica,--no mere jewels in her crown, but\r\nfoundation-stones of her sea power,--she nevertheless saw that the\r\nsuccessful rebellion of the English colonists against the hitherto\r\nunrivalled sea power of the mother-country would be a dangerous\r\nexample to her own enormous colonial system, from which she yearly\r\ndrew so great subsidies. If England with her navy should fail, what\r\ncould Spain achieve? In the introductory chapter it was pointed out\r\nthat the income of the Spanish government was drawn, not as a light\r\ntax upon a wealthy sea power, built upon the industry and commerce of\r\nthe kingdom, but from a narrow stream of gold and silver trickling\r\nthrough a few treasure-ships loaded with the spoils of colonies\r\nadministered upon the narrowest system. Spain had much to lose, as\r\nwell as to gain. It was true still, as in 1760, that she was the power\r\nwith which England could war to the greatest advantage. Nevertheless,\r\nexisting injuries and dynastic sympathy carried the day. Spain entered\r\nupon the secretly hostile course pursued by France.\r\n\r\nTo this explosive condition of things the news of Burgoyne's surrender\r\nacted as a spark. The experience of former wars had taught France the\r\nworth of the Americans as enemies, and she was expecting to find in\r\nthem valuable helpers in her schemes of revenge; now it seemed that\r\neven alone they might be able to take care of themselves, and reject\r\nany alliance. The tidings reached Europe on the 2d of December, 1777;\r\non the 16th the French foreign minister informed the commissioners of\r\nCongress that the king was ready to recognize the independence of the\r\nUnited States, and to make with them a commercial treaty and\r\ncontingent defensive alliance. The speed with which the business was\r\ndone shows that France had made up her mind; and the treaty, so\r\nmomentous in its necessary consequences, was signed on the 6th of\r\nFebruary, 1778.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to give the detailed terms of the treaty; but it\r\nis important to observe, first, that the express renunciation of\r\nCanada and Nova Scotia by France foreshadowed that political theory\r\nwhich is now known as the Monroe doctrine, the claims of which can\r\nscarcely be made good without an adequate sea-force; and next, that\r\nthe alliance with France, and subsequently with Spain, brought to the\r\nAmericans that which they above all needed,--a sea power to\r\ncounterbalance that of England. Will it be too much for American\r\npride to admit that, had France refused to contest the control of the\r\nsea with England, the latter would have been able to reduce the\r\nAtlantic seaboard? Let us not kick down the ladder by which we\r\nmounted, nor refuse to acknowledge what our fathers felt in their hour\r\nof trial.\r\n\r\nBefore going on with the story of this maritime war, the military\r\nsituation as it existed in the different parts of the world should be\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nThe three features which cause it to differ markedly from that at the\r\nopening of the Seven Years' War, in 1756, are--(1) the hostile\r\nrelation of America to England; (2) the early appearance of Spain as\r\nthe ally of France; and (3) the neutrality of the other continental\r\nStates, which left France without preoccupation on the land side.\r\n\r\nOn the North American continent the Americans had held Boston for two\r\nyears. Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island were occupied by the English,\r\nwho also held New York and Philadelphia. Chesapeake Bay and its\r\nentrance, being without strong posts, were in the power of any fleet\r\nthat appeared against them. In the South, since the unsuccessful\r\nattack upon Charlestown in 1776, no movement of importance had been\r\nmade by the English; up to the declaration of war by France the chief\r\nevents of the war had been north of the Chesapeake (of Baltimore). In\r\nCanada, on the other hand, the Americans had failed, and it remained\r\nto the end a firm base to the English power.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the most significant element to be noted is the state of\r\npreparedness of the French navy, and to some extent of the Spanish, as\r\ncompared with previous wars. England stood wholly on the defensive,\r\nand without allies; while the Bourbon kings aimed at the conquest of\r\nGibraltar and Port Mahon, and the invasion of England. The first two,\r\nhowever, were the dear objects of Spain, the last of France; and this\r\ndivergence of aims was fatal to the success of this maritime\r\ncoalition. In the introductory chapter allusion was made to the\r\nstrategic question raised by these two policies.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies the grip of the two combatants on the land was in\r\nfact about equal, though it should not have been so. Both France and\r\nEngland were strongly posted in the Windward Islands,--the one at\r\nMartinique, the other at Barbadoes. It must be noted that the position\r\nof the latter, to windward of all others of the group, was a decided\r\nstrategic advantage in the days of sail. As it happened, the fighting\r\nwas pretty nearly confined to the neighborhood of the Lesser Antilles.\r\nHere, at the opening of the struggle, the English island of Dominica\r\nlay between the French Martinique and Guadeloupe; it was therefore\r\ncoveted and seized. Next south of Martinique lay Sta. Lucia, a French\r\ncolony. Its strong harbor on the lee side, known as Gros Ilot Bay, was\r\na capital place from which to watch the proceedings of the French navy\r\nin Fort Royal, Martinique. The English captured the island, and from\r\nthat safe anchorage Rodney watched and pursued the French fleet before\r\nhis famous action in 1782. The islands to the southward were of\r\ninferior military consequence. In the greater islands, Spain should\r\nhave outweighed England, holding as she did Cuba, Porto Rico, and,\r\nwith France, Hayti, as against Jamaica alone. Spain, however, counted\r\nhere for nothing but a dead-weight; and England had elsewhere too much\r\non her hands to attack her. The only point in America where the\r\nSpanish arms made themselves felt was in the great region east of the\r\nMississippi, then known as Florida, which, though at that time an\r\nEnglish possession, did not join the revolt of the colonies.\r\n\r\nIn the East Indies it will be remembered that France had received back\r\nher stations at the peace of 1763; but the political predominance of\r\nthe English in Bengal was not offset by similar control of the French\r\nin any part of the peninsula. During the ensuing years the English had\r\nextended and strengthened their power, favored in so doing by the\r\ncharacter of their chief representatives, Clive and Warren Hastings.\r\nPowerful native enemies had, however, risen against them in the south\r\nof the peninsula, both on the east and west, affording an excellent\r\nopportunity for France to regain her influence when the war broke out;\r\nbut her government and people remained blind to the possibilities of\r\nthat vast region. Not so England. The very day the news of the\r\noutbreak of war reached Calcutta, July 7, 1778, Hastings sent orders\r\nto the governor of Madras to attack Pondicherry, and set the example\r\nby seizing Chandernagore. The naval force of each nation was\r\ninsignificant; but the French commodore, after a brief action, forsook\r\nPondicherry, which surrendered after a siege by land and sea of\r\nseventy days. The following March, 1779, Mahé, the last French\r\nsettlement, fell, and the French flag again disappeared; while at the\r\nsame time there arrived a strong English squadron of six\r\nships-of-the-line under Admiral Hughes. The absence of any similar\r\nFrench force gave the entire control of the sea to the English until\r\nthe arrival of Suffren, nearly three years later. In the mean while\r\nHolland had been drawn into the war, and her stations, Negapatam on\r\nthe Coromandel coast, and the very important harbor of Trincomalee in\r\nCeylon, were both captured, the latter in January, 1782, by the joint\r\nforces of the army and navy. The successful accomplishment of these\r\ntwo enterprises completed the military situation in Hindostan at the\r\ntime when the arrival of Suffren, just one month later, turned the\r\nnominal war into a desperate and bloody contest. Suffren found himself\r\nwith a decidedly stronger squadron, but without a port, either French\r\nor allied, on which to base his operations against the English.\r\n\r\nOf these four chief theatres of the war, two, North America and the\r\nWest Indies, as might be expected from their nearness, blend and\r\ndirectly affect each other. This is not so obviously the case with the\r\nstruggles in Europe and India. The narrative therefore naturally falls\r\ninto three principal divisions, which may to some extent be treated\r\nseparately. After such separate consideration their mutual influence\r\nwill be pointed out, together with any useful lessons to be gathered\r\nfrom the goodness or badness, the success or failure, of the grand\r\ncombinations, and from the part played by sea power.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of March, 1778, the French ambassador at London notified\r\nthe English government that France had acknowledged the independence\r\nof the United States, and made with them a treaty of commerce and\r\ndefensive alliance. England at once recalled her ambassador; but\r\nthough war was imminent and England at disadvantage, the Spanish king\r\noffered mediation, and France wrongly delayed to strike. In June,\r\nAdmiral Keppel sailed from Portsmouth, with twenty ships, on a cruise.\r\nFalling in with two French frigates, his guns, to bring them to,\r\nopened the war. Finding from their papers that thirty-two French ships\r\nlay in Brest, he at once returned for reinforcements. Sailing again\r\nwith thirty ships, he fell in with the French fleet under D'Orvilliers\r\nto the westward of Ushant, and to windward, with a westerly wind. On\r\nthe 27th of July was fought the first fleet action of the war,\r\ngenerally known as the battle of Ushant.\r\n\r\nThis battle, in which thirty ships-of-the-line fought on either side,\r\nwas wholly indecisive in its results. No ship was taken or sunk; both\r\nfleets, after separating, returned to their respective ports. The\r\naction nevertheless obtained great celebrity in England from the\r\npublic indignation at its lack of result, and from the storm of naval\r\nand political controversy which followed. The admiral and the officer\r\nthird in command belonged to different political parties; they made\r\ncharges, one against the other, and in the following courts-martial\r\nall England divided, chiefly on party lines. Public and naval\r\nsentiment generally favored the commander-in-chief, Keppel.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. IX. KEPPEL OFF USHANT JULY 27, 1778.]\r\n\r\nTactically, the battle presents some interesting features, and\r\ninvolves one issue which is still living to-day. Keppel was to leeward\r\nand wished to force an action; in order to do this he signalled a\r\ngeneral chase to windward, so that his fastest ships might overtake\r\nthe slower ones of the enemy. Granting equal original fleet-speed,\r\nthis was quite correct. D'Orvilliers, to windward, had no intention of\r\nfighting except on his own terms. As will generally be the case, the\r\nfleet acting on the offensive obtained its wish. At daybreak of the\r\n27th both fleets were on the port tack, heading west-northwest, with\r\na steady breeze at southwest (Plate IX., A, A, A).[121] The English\r\nrear (R) had fallen to leeward,[122] and Keppel consequently made\r\nsignal to six of its ships to chase to windward, so as to place them\r\nin a better position to support the main body if it could get into\r\naction. D'Orvilliers observed this movement, and construed it to show\r\nan intention to attack his rear with a superior force. The two fleets\r\nbeing then from six to eight miles apart, he wore his fleet in\r\nsuccession (French A to B), by which he lost ground to leeward, but\r\napproached the enemy, and was able to see them better (Positions B, B,\r\nB). At the completion of this evolution the wind hauled to the\r\nsouthward, favoring the English; so Keppel, instead of going about,\r\nstood on for half an hour more (English B to C), and then tacked\r\ntogether in wake of the French. This confirmed D'Orvilliers'\r\nsuspicions, and as the wind, which certainly favored the English that\r\nmorning, now hauled back again to the westward, permitting them to lay\r\nup for the French rear, he wore his fleet together (B to C), thus\r\nbringing the rest to aid the rear, now become the van, and preventing\r\nKeppel from concentrating on or penetrating it. The two fleets thus\r\npassed on opposite tacks (C),[123] exchanging ineffective broadsides,\r\nthe French running free to windward and having the power to attack,\r\nbut not using it. D'Orvilliers then made the signal for his van,\r\nformerly the rear, to wear to leeward of the English rear, which was\r\nto leeward of its own main body, intending himself to remain to\r\nwindward and so attack it on both sides; but the commander of that\r\ndivision, a prince of the blood royal, did not obey, and the possible\r\nadvantage was lost. On the English side the same manoeuvre was\r\nattempted. The admiral of the van and some of his ships tacked, as\r\nsoon as out of fire (D),[124] and stood after the French rear; but for\r\nthe most part the damage to rigging prevented tacking, and wearing was\r\nimpossible on account of the ships coming up behind. The French now\r\nstood to leeward and formed line again, but the English were not in\r\ncondition to attack. This was the end of the battle.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that there are some interesting points about this\r\nresultless engagement. One is, that Keppel's conduct was approved\r\nthroughout, on oath before the court-martial, by one of the most\r\ndistinguished admirals England has brought forth, Sir John Jervis, who\r\ncommanded a ship in the fleet. It does not indeed appear what he could\r\nhave done more; but his lack of tactical understanding is shown by a\r\ncurious remark in his defence. \"If the French admiral really meant to\r\ncome to action,\" says he, \"I apprehend he would never have put his\r\nfleet on the contrary tack to that on which the British fleet was\r\napproaching.\" This remark can only proceed from ignorance or\r\nthoughtlessness of the danger to which the rear of the French fleet\r\nwould have been exposed, and is the more curious as he himself had\r\nsaid the English were lying up for it. Keppel's idea seems to have\r\nbeen that the French should have waited for him to come up abreast,\r\nand then go at it, ship for ship, in what was to him the good old\r\nstyle; D'Orvilliers was too highly trained to be capable of such\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Duc de Chartres,[125] commanding the French van\r\nduring the firing, to wear in obedience to orders, whether due to\r\nmisunderstanding or misconduct, raises the question, which is still\r\ndebated, as to the proper position for a naval commander-in-chief in\r\naction. Had D'Orvilliers been in the van, he could have insured the\r\nevolution he wished. From the centre the admiral has the extremities\r\nof his fleet equally visible, or invisible, as it may be. At the head\r\nhe enforces his orders by his example. The French toward the end of\r\nthis war solved the question by taking him out of the line altogether\r\nand putting him on board a frigate, for the avowed reasons that he\r\ncould thus better see the movements of his fleet and of the enemy\r\nwithout being blinded by smoke or distracted by the occurrences on\r\nboard his own ship, and that his signals could be better seen.[126]\r\nThis position, resembling somewhat that of a general on shore, being\r\nremote from personal risk, was also assumed by Lord Howe in 1778; but\r\nboth that officer and the French abandoned the practice later. Nelson\r\nat Trafalgar, the end of his career, led his column; but it may be\r\ndoubted whether he had any other motive than his ardor for battle. The\r\ntwo other great attacks in which he commanded in chief were directed\r\nagainst ships at anchor, and in neither did he take the head of the\r\ncolumn; for the good reason that, his knowledge of the ground being\r\nimperfect, the leading ship was in most danger of grounding. The\r\ncommon practice in the days of broadside sailing-ships, except when a\r\ngeneral chase was ordered, was for the admiral to be in the line, and\r\nin the centre of it. The departure from this custom on the part of\r\nboth Nelson and Collingwood, each of whom led his own columns at\r\nTrafalgar, may have had some reason, and an ordinary man rather\r\nshrinks from criticising the action of officers of their eminence. The\r\ndanger to which were exposed the two senior officers of the fleet,\r\nupon whom so much depended, is obvious; and had any serious injury\r\nbefallen their persons, or the head of their columns, the lack of\r\ntheir influence would have been seriously felt. As it was, they were\r\nspeedily obliterated, as admirals, in the smoke of the battle, leaving\r\nto those who came after them no guidance or control except the\r\nbrilliancy of their courage and example. A French admiral has pointed\r\nout that the practical effect of the mode of attack at Trafalgar, two\r\ncolumns bearing down upon a line at right angles to them, was to\r\nsacrifice the head of the columns in making two breaches in the\r\nenemy's line. So far, very well; the sacrifice was well worth while;\r\nand into these breaches came up the rear ships of each column, nearly\r\nfresh, forming in fact a _reserve_ which fell upon the shattered ships\r\nof the enemy on either side of the breaks. Now this idea of a reserve\r\nprompts a thought as to the commander-in-chief. The size of his ship\r\nwas such as precluded its being out of the order; but would it not\r\nhave been well had the admiral of each column been with this reserve,\r\nkeeping in his hands the power of directing it according to the\r\nchances of the action, making him a reality as well as a name for some\r\ntime longer, and to a very useful purpose? The difficulty of arranging\r\nany system of signals or light despatch-boats which could take the\r\nplace of the aids or messengers of a general, coupled with the fact\r\nthat ships cannot stand still, as divisions of men do, waiting orders,\r\nbut that they must have steerage-way, precludes the idea of putting an\r\nadmiral of a fleet under way in a light vessel. By so doing he becomes\r\nsimply a spectator; whereas by being in the most powerful ship of the\r\nfleet he retains the utmost weight possible after action is once\r\nengaged, and, if this ship be in the reserve, the admiral keeps to the\r\nlatest possible moment the power of commander-in-chief in his own\r\nhands. \"Half a loaf is better than no bread;\" if the admiral cannot,\r\nfrom the conditions of sea warfare, occupy the calmly watchful\r\nposition of his brother on shore, let there be secured for him as much\r\nas may be. The practice of Farragut after New Orleans and Vicksburg,\r\nthat is to say, in the latter part of his career, when it may be\r\nbelieved experience had determined his views, was to lead in person.\r\nIt is known that he very reluctantly, at the solicitation of various\r\nofficers, yielded his convictions in this matter at Mobile so far as\r\nto take the second place, and afterward freely expressed his regrets\r\nfor having done so. It may, however, be argued that the character of\r\nall the actions in which Farragut commanded had a peculiarity,\r\ndifferentiating them from battles in the strict sense of the word. At\r\nNew Orleans, at Vicksburg, at Port Hudson, and at Mobile, the task was\r\nnot to engage, but to pass fortifications which the fleet confessedly\r\ncould not stand up to; and the passage was to be made under conditions\r\nmainly of pilotage upon ground as to which, unlike Nelson, he had good\r\nknowledge. There was thus imposed upon the commander-in-chief the duty\r\nof leadership in the literal, as well as the military, sense of the\r\nterm. So leading, he not only pointed out to the fleet the safe road,\r\nbut, drawing continually ahead of the smoke, was better able to see\r\nand judge the path ahead, and to assume the responsibility of a course\r\nwhich he may have prescribed and intended throughout, but from which a\r\nsubordinate might shrink. It has not perhaps been commonly noted, that\r\nat Mobile the leaders, not only of one but of both columns, at the\r\ncritical point of the road hesitated and doubted as to the admiral's\r\npurpose; not that they had not received it clearly, but because\r\ncircumstances seemed to them to be different from what he had\r\nsupposed. Not only Alden in the \"Brooklyn,\" but Craven also in the\r\n\"Tecumseh,\" departed from the admiral's orders and left the course\r\ndictated to them, with disastrous results. There is no necessity to\r\ncondemn either captain; but the irresistible inference is that\r\nFarragut was unqualifiedly right in his opinion that the man who alone\r\nhas the highest responsibility should, under the conditions of his\r\nbattles, be in the front. And here it must be remarked that at such\r\ncritical moments of doubt any but the highest order of mind tends to\r\nthrow off the responsibility of decision upon the superior, though\r\nfrom the instancy of the case hesitation or delay may be fatal. A man\r\nwho as the commissioned chief would act intelligently, as the mere\r\nsubordinate will balk. Nelson's action at St. Vincent will rarely be\r\nemulated, a truth which is strongly shown by the fact that\r\nCollingwood was immediately in his rear that day, and did not imitate\r\nhis action till signalled by the commander-in-chief; yet after\r\nreceiving the authority of the signal, he particularly distinguished\r\nhimself by his judgment and daring.[127] It will be recalled, also, in\r\nconnection with this question of pilot-ground battles, that a central\r\nposition nearly lost the flag-ship at New Orleans, owing to the\r\ndarkness and to the smoke from the preceding ships; the United States\r\nfleet came near finding itself without its leader after the passage of\r\nthe forts. Now as the mention of a reserve prompted one set of\r\nconsiderations, so the name of pilotage suggests certain ideas,\r\nbroader than itself, which modify what has been said of keeping the\r\nadmiral with the reserve. The ease and quickness with which a steam\r\nfleet can change its formation make it very probable that a fleet\r\nbearing down to attack may find itself, almost at the very moment of\r\ncollision, threatened with some unlooked-for combination; then where\r\nwould be the happiest position for an admiral? Doubtless in that part\r\nof his own order where he could most readily pilot his ships into the\r\nnew disposition, or direction, by which he would meet the changed\r\nconditions; that is, in the position of leading. It would seem that\r\nthere are always two moments of greatest importance in a sea-fight;\r\none which determines the method of the main attack, the other the\r\nbringing up and directing the effort of the reserve. If the first is\r\nmore important, the second perhaps requires the higher order of\r\nability; for the former may and should proceed on a before-determined\r\nplan, while the latter may, and often must, be shaped to meet\r\nunforeseen exigencies. The conditions of sea-battles of the future\r\ncontain one element that land battles cannot have,--the extreme\r\nrapidity with which encounters and changes of order can take place.\r\nHowever troops may be moved by steam to the field of battle, they will\r\nthere fight on foot or on horseback, and with a gradual development of\r\ntheir plan, which will allow the commander-in-chief time to make his\r\nwishes known (as a rule, of course), in case of a change in the\r\nenemy's attack. On the other hand, a fleet, comparatively small in\r\nnumbers and with its component units clearly defined, may be\r\nmeditating an important change of which no sign can appear until it\r\nbegins, and which will occupy but a few minutes. So far as these\r\nremarks are sound, they show the need of a second in command\r\nthoroughly conversant with not only the plans, but with the leading\r\nprinciples of action of his chief,--a need plain enough from the fact\r\nthat the two extremities of the order-of-battle may be necessarily\r\nremote, and that you want the spirit of the leader at both\r\nextremities. As he cannot be there in person, the best thing is to\r\nhave an efficient second at one end. As regards Nelson's position at\r\nTrafalgar, mentioned at the beginning of this discussion, it is to be\r\nnoted that the \"Victory\" did nothing that another ship could not have\r\ndone as well, and that the lightness of the wind forbade the\r\nexpectation of any sudden change in the enemy's order. The enormous\r\nrisk run by the person of the admiral, on whose ship was concentrated\r\nthe fire of the enemy's line, and which led several captains to\r\nimplore a change, was condemned long before by Nelson himself in one\r\nof his letters after the battle of the Nile:--\r\n\r\n    \"I think, if it had pleased God I had not been wounded, not a\r\n    boat would have escaped to have told the tale; but do not\r\n    believe that any individual in the fleet is to blame.... I only\r\n    mean to say that if my experience could in person have directed\r\n    those individuals, there was every appearance that Almighty God\r\n    would have continued to bless my endeavors,\" etc.[128]\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding such an expression of opinion based upon\r\nexperience, he took the most exposed position at Trafalgar, and upon\r\nthe loss of the leader there followed a curious exemplification of its\r\neffects. Collingwood at once, rightly or wrongly, avoidably or\r\nunavoidably, reversed Nelson's plans, urged with his last breath.\r\n\"Anchor! Hardy, do you anchor!\" said the dying chief. \"Anchor!\" said\r\nCollingwood. \"It is the last thing I should have thought of.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[113] Troude: Batailles Navales.\r\n\r\n[114] Mahon: History of England.\r\n\r\n[115] Lapeyrouse-Bonfils, vol. iii. p. 5.\r\n\r\n[116] Troude, vol. ii. pp. 3-5.

As the _battle_\r\nconsisted merely in the passage by each other of two fleets, moving in\r\nopposite parallel directions, an encounter always indecisive and\r\nfutile, the previous manoeuvres constitute the chief interest in an\r\naffair whose historical importance is due to other than tactical\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n[122] The line drawn through the centre of the English fleet at A\r\nshows the close-hauled line (south-southeast) on which, by strict\r\ntactical requirement, the English ships should have borne from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[123] The leading ships of the two fleets diverged from each other\r\n(C), which is, by the French, attributed to the English van keeping\r\naway; by the English it is said that the French van luffed.

He was some miles from\r\nRodney at the time. \"The separated French ship in the N.W., having got\r\nthe breeze at the same time as our van division, boldly stood for and\r\nendeavored to weather the British advanced ships; that being the only\r\nway to regain her own fleet, then to windward. To such a length did\r\nshe carry her audacity that she compelled the Alfred, the headmost\r\nship of Sir Samuel Hood's division, to bear up in order to allow her\r\nto pass. Every eye was fixed upon the bold Frenchman, excepting those\r\nwho were anxiously looking out on the commander-in-chief to make the\r\nsignal to engage, but who, most likely from not supposing it could be\r\nan enemy, did not throw out the ardently looked-for signal, and\r\ntherefore not a gun was fired. This is mentioned to show the state of\r\ndiscipline on board the ships composing Sir Samuel Hood's division,\r\nand that he, though second in command, would not fire a single shot\r\nuntil directed to do so by his commander-in-chief. 'It is more than\r\nprobable that Sir S. Hood's reason for having waited for the signal to\r\nengage from his commander-in-chief, ere he would fire, arose from the\r\nsupposition that had he been the occasion of prematurely bringing on\r\nan action under the above circumstances, he would have been\r\nresponsible for the results.'\" (White's Naval Researches, p. 97.)\r\n\r\nHood may have been influenced by Rodney's bearing toward inferiors\r\nwhose initiative displeased him.

With him went as a passenger a\r\nminister accredited to Congress, who was instructed to decline all\r\nrequests for subsidies, and to avoid explicit engagements relative to\r\nthe conquest of Canada and other British possessions. \"The Cabinet of\r\nVersailles,\" says a French historian, \"was not sorry for the United\r\nStates to have near them a cause of anxiety, which would make them\r\nfeel the value of the French alliance.\"[129] While acknowledging the\r\ngenerous sympathy of many Frenchmen for their struggle, Americans need\r\nnot blind themselves to the self-interestedness of the French\r\ngovernment. Neither should they find fault; for its duty was to\r\nconsider French interests first.\r\n\r\nD'Estaing's progress was very slow. It is said that he wasted much\r\ntime in drills, and even uselessly. However that may be, he did not\r\nreach his destination, the Capes of the Delaware, until the 8th of\r\nJuly,--making a passage of twelve weeks, four of which were spent in\r\nreaching the Atlantic. The English government had news of his intended\r\nsailing; and in fact, as soon as they recalled their ambassador at\r\nParis, orders were sent to America to evacuate Philadelphia, and\r\nconcentrate upon New York. Fortunately for them, Lord Howe's\r\nmovements were marked by a vigor and system other than D'Estaing's.\r\nFirst assembling his fleet and transports in Delaware Bay, and then\r\nhastening the embarkation of stores and supplies, he left Philadelphia\r\nas soon as the army had marched from there for New York. Ten days were\r\ntaken up in reaching the mouth of the bay;[130] but he sailed from it\r\nthe 28th of June, ten days before D'Estaing arrived, though more than\r\nten weeks after he had sailed. Once outside, a favoring wind took the\r\nwhole fleet to Sandy Hook in two days. War is unforgiving; the prey\r\nthat D'Estaing had missed by delays foiled him in his attempts upon\r\nboth New York and Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nThe day after Howe's arrival at Sandy Hook the English army reached\r\nthe heights of Navesink, after an harassing march through New Jersey,\r\nwith Washington's troops hanging upon its rear. By the active\r\nco-operation of the navy it was carried up to New York by the 5th of\r\nJuly; and Howe then went back to bar the entrance to the port against\r\nthe French fleet. As no battle followed, the details of his\r\narrangements will not be given; but a very full and interesting\r\naccount by an officer of the fleet can be found in Ekins's \"Naval\r\nBattles.\" Attention, however, may well be called to the combination of\r\nenergy, thought, skill, and determination shown by the admiral. The\r\nproblem before him was to defend a practicable pass with six\r\nsixty-four-gun ships and three of fifty, against eight of seventy-four\r\nguns or over, three sixty-fours, and one fifty,--it may be said\r\nagainst nearly double his own force.\r\n\r\nD'Estaing anchored outside, south of the Hook, on the 11th of July,\r\nand there remained until the 22d, engaged in sounding the bar, and\r\nwith every apparent determination to enter. On the 22d a high\r\nnortheast wind, coinciding with a spring tide, raised the water on the\r\nbar to thirty feet. The French fleet got under way, and worked up to\r\nwindward to a point fair for crossing the bar. Then D'Estaing's heart\r\nfailed him under the discouragement of the pilots; he gave up the\r\nattack and stood away to the southward.\r\n\r\nNaval officers cannot but sympathize with the hesitation of a seaman\r\nto disregard the advice of pilots, especially on a coast foreign to\r\nhim; but such sympathy should not close their eyes to the highest type\r\nof character. Let any one compare the action of D'Estaing at New York\r\nwith that of Nelson at Copenhagen and the Nile, or that of Farragut at\r\nMobile and Port Hudson, and the inferiority of the Frenchman as a\r\nmilitary leader, guided only by military considerations, is painfully\r\napparent. New York was the very centre of the British power; its fall\r\ncould not but have shortened the war. In fairness to D'Estaing,\r\nhowever, it must be remembered that other than military considerations\r\nhad to weigh with him. The French admiral doubtless had instructions\r\nsimilar to those of the French minister, and he probably reasoned that\r\nFrance had nothing to gain by the fall of New York, which might have\r\nled to peace between America and England, and left the latter free to\r\nturn all her power against his own country. Less than that would have\r\nbeen enough to decide his wavering mind as to risking his fleet over\r\nthe bar.\r\n\r\nHowe was more fortunate than D'Estaing, in having no divided purposes.\r\nHaving escaped from Philadelphia and saved New York by his diligence,\r\nhe had in store the further honor of saving Rhode Island by the like\r\nrapid movements. Scattered ships-of-war from a fleet despatched from\r\nEngland now began to arrive. On the 28th of July Howe was informed\r\nthat the French fleet, which had disappeared to the southward, had\r\nbeen seen heading for Rhode Island. In four days his fleet was ready\r\nfor sea, but owing to contrary winds did not reach Point Judith till\r\nthe 9th of August. There he anchored, and learned that D'Estaing had\r\nrun the batteries the day before and anchored between Gould and\r\nCanonicut Islands;[131] the Seakonnet and Western passages had also\r\nbeen occupied by French ships, and the fleet was prepared to sustain\r\nthe American army in an attack upon the British works.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Howe, although his reinforcements did not raise the\r\nEnglish fleet to over two thirds the strength of the French, upset\r\nD'Estaing's plans. With the prevailing summer southwest breezes\r\nblowing straight into the bay, he was exposed to any attempts his\r\nadversary might make. That same night the wind shifted unexpectedly to\r\nthe northward, and D'Estaing at once got under way and stood out to\r\nsea. Howe, though surprised by this unlooked-for act,--for he had not\r\nfelt himself strong enough to attack,--also made sail to keep the\r\nweather-gage. The next twenty-four hours passed in manoeuvring for the\r\nadvantage; but on the night of the 11th of August a violent gale of\r\nwind dispersed the fleets. Great injury was done to the vessels of\r\nboth, and among others the French flag-ship \"Languedoc,\" of ninety\r\nguns, lost all her masts and her rudder. Immediately after the gale\r\ntwo different English fifty-gun ships, in fighting order, fell in, the\r\none with the \"Languedoc,\" the other with the \"Tonnant,\" of eighty\r\nguns, having only one mast standing. Under such conditions both\r\nEnglish ships attacked; but night coming on, they ceased action,\r\nintending to begin again in the morning. When morning came, other\r\nFrench ships also came, and the opportunity was lost. It is suggestive\r\nto note that one of the captains was Hotham, who as admiral of the\r\nMediterranean fleet, seventeen years later, so annoyed Nelson by his\r\ncool satisfaction in having taken only two ships: \"We must be\r\ncontented; we have done very well.\" This was the immediate occasion of\r\nNelson's characteristic saying, \"Had we taken ten sail, and allowed\r\nthe eleventh to escape, being able to get at her, I could never have\r\ncalled it well done.\"\r\n\r\nThe English fell back on New York. The French rallied again off the\r\nentrance of Narragansett Bay; but D'Estaing decided that he could not\r\nremain on account of the damage to the squadron, and accordingly\r\nsailed for Boston on the 21st of August. Rhode Island was thus left to\r\nthe English, who retained it for a year longer, evacuating then for\r\nstrategic reasons. Howe on his part diligently repaired his ships, and\r\nsailed again for Rhode Island when he heard of the French being there;\r\nbut meeting on the way a vessel with word of their going to Boston, he\r\nfollowed them to that harbor, in which they were too strongly placed\r\nto be attacked. Taking into consideration his enforced return to New\r\nYork, the necessary repairs, and the fact that he was only four days\r\nbehind the French at Boston, it may be believed that Howe showed to\r\nthe end the activity which characterized the beginning of his\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nScarcely a shot had been exchanged between the two fleets, yet the\r\nweaker had thoroughly outgeneralled the stronger. With the exception of\r\nthe manoeuvres for the weather-gage after D'Estaing left Newport, which\r\nhave not been preserved, and of Howe's dispositions to receive the\r\nexpected attack in New York Bay, the lessons are not tactical, but\r\nstrategic, and of present application. Chief among them undoubtedly\r\nstands the value of celerity and watchfulness, combined with knowledge\r\nof one's profession. Howe learned of his danger by advices from home\r\nthree weeks after D'Estaing sailed from Toulon. He had to gather in his\r\ncruisers from the Chesapeake and outside, get his ships-of-the-line\r\nfrom New York and Rhode Island, embark the supplies of an army of ten\r\nthousand men, move down the Delaware,--which unavoidably took ten\r\ndays,--and round to New York again. D'Estaing was ten days behind him\r\nat the Delaware, twelve days at Sandy Hook, and only one day ahead of\r\nhim in entering Newport, outside which harbor he had lain ten days\r\nbefore sailing in. An English narrator in the fleet, speaking of the\r\nuntiring labor between June 30, when the English army reached Navesink,\r\nand the arrival of the French fleet on the 11th of July, says: \"Lord\r\nHowe attended in person as usual, and by his presence animated the zeal\r\nand quickened the industry of officers and men.\" In this quality he was\r\na marked contrast to his amiable but indolent brother, General Howe.\r\n\r\nThe same industry and watchfulness marked his remaining operations. As\r\nsoon as the French ships hauled off to the southward, lookout vessels\r\nfollowed them, and preparations continued (notably of fireships) for\r\npursuit. The last ship that joined from England crossed the bar at New\r\nYork on the 30th of July. On the 1st of August the fleet was ready for\r\nsea, with four fire-ships. The accident of the wind delayed his next\r\nmovements; but, as has been seen, he came up only one day after the\r\nentrance of the enemy into Newport, which his inferior force could not\r\nhave prevented. But the object of the enemy, which he could not\r\noppose, was frustrated by his presence. D'Estaing was no sooner in\r\nNewport than he wished himself out. Howe's position was strategically\r\nexcellent. With his weatherly position in reference to the prevailing\r\nwinds, the difficulty of beating a fleet out through the narrow\r\nentrance to the harbor would expose the French ships trying it to be\r\nattacked in detail; while if the wind unluckily came fair, the admiral\r\nrelied upon his own skill to save his squadron.\r\n\r\nCooper, in one of his novels, \"The Two Admirals,\" makes his hero say\r\nto a cavilling friend that if he had not been in the way of good luck,\r\nhe could not have profited by it. The sortie of the French, the\r\nsubsequent gale, and the resulting damage were all what is commonly\r\ncalled luck; but if it had not been for Howe's presence off Point\r\nJudith threatening them, they would have ridden out the gale at their\r\nanchors inside. Howe's energy and his confidence in himself as a\r\nseaman had put him in the way of good luck, and it is not fair to deny\r\nhis active share in bringing it about. But for him the gale would not\r\nhave saved the British force in Newport.[132]\r\n\r\nD'Estaing, having repaired his ships, sailed with his whole force for\r\nMartinique on the 4th of November; on the same day Commodore Hotham\r\nleft New York for Barbadoes, with five sixty-four and fifty-gun ships\r\nand a convoy of five thousand troops, destined for the conquest of\r\nSta. Lucia Island. On the way a heavy gale of wind injured the French\r\nfleet more than the English, the French flag-ship losing her main and\r\nmizzen topmasts. The loss of these spars, and the fact that twelve\r\nunencumbered ships-of-war reached Martinique only one day before the\r\nconvoy of fifty-nine English transports reached Barbadoes, a hundred\r\nmiles farther on, tells badly for the professional skill which then\r\nand now is a determining feature in naval war.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Barrington, commanding at Barbadoes, showed the same energy as\r\nHowe. The transports arrived on the 10th; the troops were kept on\r\nboard; sailed on the morning of the 12th for Sta. Lucia, and anchored\r\nthere at three P.M. the 13th. The same afternoon half the troops were\r\nlanded, and the rest the next morning. They seized at once a better\r\nport, to which the admiral was about to move the transports when the\r\nappearance of D'Estaing prevented him. All that night the transports\r\nwere being warped inside the ships-of-war, and the latter anchored\r\nacross the entrance to the bay, especial care being taken to\r\nstrengthen the two extremities of the line, and to prevent the enemy\r\nfrom passing inside the weather end, as the English ships in after\r\nyears did at the battle of the Nile. The French was much more than\r\ndouble the English fleet; and if the latter were destroyed, the\r\ntransports and troops would be trapped.\r\n\r\nD'Estaing stood down along the English order twice from north to\r\nsouth, cannonading at long range, but did not anchor. Abandoning then\r\nhis intentions against the fleet, he moved to another bay, landed some\r\nFrench soldiers, and assaulted the position of the English troops.\r\nFailing here also, he retired to Martinique; and the French garrison,\r\nwhich had been driven into the interior of the island, surrendered.\r\n\r\nIt seems scarcely necessary to point out the admirable diligence of\r\nAdmiral Barrington, to which and to the skill of his dispositions he\r\nowed this valuable strategic success; for such it was. Sta. Lucia was\r\nthe island next south of Martinique, and the harbor of Gros Ilot at\r\nits northern end was especially adapted to the work of watching the\r\nFrench depot at Fort Royal, their principal station in the West\r\nIndies. Thence Rodney pursued them before his great action in 1782.\r\n\r\nThe absence of precise information causes hesitation in condemning\r\nD'Estaing for this mortifying failure. His responsibility depends upon\r\nthe wind, which may have been light under the land, and upon his power\r\nto anchor. The fact, however, remains that he passed twice along the\r\nenemy's line within cannon-shot, yet did not force a decisive action.\r\nHis course was unfavorably criticised by the great Suffren, then one\r\nof his captains.[133]\r\n\r\nThe English had thus retrieved the capture of Dominica, which had been\r\ntaken on the 8th of September by the French governor of the West India\r\nIslands. There being no English squadron there, no difficulty had been\r\nmet. The value of Dominica to the French has been pointed out; and it\r\nis necessary here to use the example of both Dominica and Sta. Lucia\r\nto enforce what has before been said, that the possession of these\r\nsmaller islands depended solely upon the naval preponderance. Upon the\r\ngrasp of this principle held by any one will depend his criticism upon\r\nthe next action of D'Estaing, to be immediately related.\r\n\r\nSix months of almost entire quiet followed the affair of Sta. Lucia.\r\nThe English were reinforced by the fleet of Byron, who took chief\r\ncommand; but the French, being joined by ten more ships-of-the-line,\r\nremained superior in numbers. About the middle of June, Byron sailed\r\nwith his fleet to protect a large convoy of merchant-ships, bound for\r\nEngland, till they were clear of the islands. D'Estaing then sent a\r\nvery small expedition which seized St. Vincent, June 16, 1779, without\r\ndifficulty; and on the 30th of June he sailed with his whole fleet to\r\nattack Grenada. Anchoring off Georgetown on the 2d of July, he landed\r\nhis soldiers, and on the 4th the garrison of seven hundred men\r\nsurrendered the island. Meanwhile Byron, hearing of the loss of St.\r\nVincent and probable attack on Grenada, sailed with a large convoy of\r\nvessels carrying troops, and with twenty-one ships-of-the-line, to\r\nregain the one and relieve the other. Receiving on the way definite\r\ninformation that the French were before Grenada, he kept on for it,\r\nrounding the northwest point of the island at daybreak of July 6. His\r\napproach had been reported the day before to D'Estaing, who remained\r\nat anchor,[134] fearing lest with the currents and light winds he\r\nmight drop too far to leeward if he let go the bottom. When the\r\nEnglish came in sight, the French got under way; but the confused\r\nmassing of their ships prevented Byron from recognizing at once the\r\ndisparity of numbers, they having twenty-five ships-of-the-line. He\r\nmade signal for a general chase, and as the disorder of the French\r\nfleet forced it to form on the leewardmost ships, the English easily\r\nretained the advantage of the wind with which they approached. As the\r\naction began, therefore, the French were to the westward with a partly\r\nformed line, on the starboard tack, heading north, the rear in\r\ndisorder, and to windward of the van and centre (Plate X., A.). The\r\nEnglish stood down with a fair wind, steering south by west on the\r\nport tack (A), between the island and the enemy, their leading ships\r\napproaching at a slight angle, but heading more directly for his yet\r\nunformed rear; while the English convoy was between its own fleet and\r\nthe island, under special charge of three ships (A, a), which were now\r\ncalled in. As the signal so far commanded a general chase, the three\r\nfastest of the English, among which was the flag of the second in\r\ncommand, Admiral Barrington, came under fire of the French centre and\r\nrear, apparently unsupported (b), and suffered much from the\r\nconsequent concentration of fire upon them. When they reached the\r\nsternmost ships they wore upon the same tack with them and stood\r\nnorth, after and to windward of them; and at about the same time\r\nByron, who had not before known of the surrender, saw the French flag\r\nflying over the forts. Signals followed to wear in succession, and for\r\nthe advanced ships to form line for mutual support, ceasing the\r\ngeneral chase under which the engagement had hitherto been fought.\r\nWhile the main body was still standing south on the port tack, three\r\nships,--\"Cornwall,\" \"Grafton,\" and \"Lion\" (c),--obeying literally the\r\nsignal for close action, had passed much to leeward of the others,\r\ndrawing upon themselves most of the fire of the enemy's line. They\r\nthus suffered very severely in men and spars; and though finally\r\nrelieved by the advanced ships, as these approached from the southward\r\non the opposite tack, they were unable, after wearing (B, c', c''), to\r\nkeep up with the fleet, and so dropped astern and toward the French.\r\nThe bulk of the injury sustained by the English fell upon these three,\r\nupon the three advanced ships under Barrington, and upon two others in\r\nthe rear (A, a), which, seeing the van so heavily engaged, did not\r\nfollow the successive movement, but bore down straight out of the\r\norder, and took their places at the head of the column (B, a, a'),--an\r\nact strongly resembling that which won Nelson such high renown at Cape\r\nSt. Vincent, but involving less responsibility.[135]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. X. D'ESTAING AND BYRON JULY 6, 1779]\r\n\r\nSo far Byron had conducted his attack, using the initiative permitted\r\nhim by the advantage of the wind and the disorder of the French rear.\r\nIt will be observed that, though it was desirable to lose no time in\r\nassailing the latter while in confusion, it is questionable whether\r\nBarrington's three ships should have been allowed to separate as far\r\nas they seem to have done from the rest of the fleet. A general chase\r\nis permissible and proper when, from superiority of numbers, original\r\nor acquired, or from the general situation, the ships first in action\r\nwill not be greatly outnumbered, or subjected to overpowering\r\nconcentration before support comes up, or when there is probability\r\nthat the enemy may escape unless promptly struck. This was not so\r\nhere. Nor should the \"Cornwall,\" \"Grafton,\" and \"Lion\" have been\r\npermitted to take a course which allowed, almost compelled, the enemy\r\nto concentrate rather than diffuse his fire. The details of the affair\r\nare not precise enough to warrant more comment than naming these\r\nmistakes, without necessarily attributing them to fault on the part of\r\nthe admiral.\r\n\r\nThe French had up to this time remained strictly on the defensive, in\r\naccordance with their usual policy. There was now offered an\r\nopportunity for offensive action which tested D'Estaing's professional\r\nqualities, and to appreciate which the situation at the moment must be\r\nunderstood. Both fleets were by this on the starboard tack, heading\r\nnorth (B, B, B), the French to leeward. The latter had received little\r\ninjury in their motive power, though their line was not in perfect\r\norder; but the English, owing to the faulty attack, had seven ships\r\nseriously crippled, four of which--the \"Monmouth\" (a'), \"Grafton,\"\r\n\"Cornwall\" (c'), and \"Lion\" (c'')--were disabled. The last three, by\r\nthree P.M., were a league astern and much to leeward of their line,\r\nbeing in fact nearer the French than the English; while the speed of\r\nthe English fleet was necessarily reduced to that of the crippled\r\nships remaining in line. These conditions bring out strongly the\r\nembarrassments of a fleet whose injuries are concentrated upon a few\r\nships, instead of being distributed among all; the ten or twelve which\r\nwere practically untouched had to conform to the capabilities of the\r\nothers. D'Estaing, with twenty-five ships, now had Byron to windward\r\nof him with seventeen or eighteen capable of holding together, but\r\nslower and less handy than their enemies, and saw him tactically\r\nembarrassed by the care of a convoy to windward and three disabled\r\nships to leeward. Under these circumstances three courses were open to\r\nthe French admiral: (1) He might stretch ahead, and, tacking in\r\nsuccession, place himself between Byron and the convoy, throwing his\r\nfrigates among the latter; (2) He might tack his fleet together and\r\nstand up to the English line to bring on a general action; or (3) he\r\ncould, after going about, cut off the three disabled ships, which\r\nmight bring on a general action with less exposure.\r\n\r\nNone of these did he do. As regards the first, he, knowing the\r\ncriticisms of the fleet, wrote home that his line was too much\r\ndisordered to allow it. Whatever the technical irregularity, it is\r\ndifficult to believe that, with the relative power of motion in the\r\ntwo fleets, the attempt was hopeless. The third alternative probably\r\npresented the greatest advantage, for it insured the separation\r\nbetween the enemy's main body and the crippled ships, and might very\r\nprobably exasperate the British admiral into an attack under most\r\nhazardous conditions. It is stated by English authorities that Byron\r\nsaid he would have borne down again, had any attack been made on them.\r\nAt three P.M. D'Estaing tacked all together, forming line on the lee\r\nship,[136] and stood to the southward again. The English imitated\r\nthis movement, except the van ship \"Monmouth\" (a'), which being too\r\nbadly hurt to manoeuvre kept on to the northward, and the three\r\nseparated ships. Two of these (c') kept on north and passed once more\r\nunder the French broadsides; but the \"Lion\" (c''), unable to keep to\r\nthe wind, kept broad off before it across the bows of the enemy, for\r\nJamaica, a thousand miles away. She was not pursued; a single\r\ntransport was the sole maritime trophy of the French. \"Had the\r\nadmiral's seamanship equalled his courage,\" wrote the celebrated\r\nSuffren, who commanded the French van ship, \"we would not have\r\nsuffered four dismasted vessels to escape.\" \"D'Estaing, at the age of\r\nthirty, had been transferred from the army to the navy with the\r\npremature rank of rear-admiral. The navy did not credit him with\r\nnautical ability when the war broke out, and it is safe to say that\r\nits opinion was justified by his conduct during it.\"[137] \"Brave as\r\nhis sword, D'Estaing was always the idol of the soldier, the idol of\r\nthe seaman; but moral authority over his officers failed him on\r\nseveral occasions, notwithstanding the marked protection extended to\r\nhim by the king.\"[138]\r\n\r\nAnother cause than incapacity as a seaman has usually been assigned by\r\nFrench historians for the impotent action of D'Estaing on this\r\noccasion. He looked upon Grenada, they say, as the real objective of\r\nhis efforts, and considered the English fleet a very secondary\r\nconcern. Ramatuelle, a naval tactician who served actively in this war\r\nand wrote under the Empire, cites this case, which he couples with\r\nthat of Yorktown and others, as exemplifying the true policy of naval\r\nwar. His words, which probably reflect the current opinion of his\r\nservice in that day, as they certainly do the policy of French\r\ngovernments, call for more than passing mention, as they involve\r\nprinciples worthy of most serious discussion:--\r\n\r\n    \"The French navy has always preferred the glory of assuring or\r\n    preserving a conquest to that, more brilliant perhaps, but\r\n    actually less real, of taking a few ships; and in that it has\r\n    approached more nearly the true end to be proposed in war. What\r\n    in fact would the loss of a few ships matter to the English? The\r\n    essential point is to attack them in their possessions, the\r\n    immediate source of their commercial wealth and of their\r\n    maritime power. The war of 1778 furnishes examples which prove\r\n    the devotion of the French admirals to the true interests of the\r\n    country. The preservation of the island of Grenada, the\r\n    reduction of Yorktown where the English army surrendered, the\r\n    conquest of the island of St. Christopher, were the result of\r\n    great battles in which the enemy was allowed to retreat\r\n    undisturbed, rather than risk giving him a chance to succor the\r\n    points attacked.\"\r\n\r\nThe issue could not be more squarely raised than in the case of\r\nGrenada. No one will deny that there are moments when a probable\r\nmilitary success is to be foregone, or postponed, in favor of one\r\ngreater or more decisive. The position of De Grasse at the Chesapeake,\r\nin 1781, with the fate of Yorktown hanging in the balance, is in\r\npoint; and it is here coupled with that of D'Estaing at Grenada, as\r\nthough both stood on the same grounds. Both are justified alike; not\r\non their respective merits as fitting the particular cases, but upon a\r\ngeneral principle. Is that principle sound? The bias of the writer\r\nquoted betrays itself unconsciously, in saying \"a few ships.\" A whole\r\nnavy is not usually to be crushed at a blow; a few ships mean an\r\nordinary naval victory. In Rodney's famous battle only five ships were\r\ntaken, though Jamaica was saved thereby.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the soundness of the principle, which is claimed\r\nas being illustrated by these two cases (St. Christopher will be\r\ndiscussed later on), it is necessary to examine what was the advantage\r\nsought, and what the determining factor of success in either case. At\r\nYorktown the advantage sought was the capture of Cornwallis's army;\r\nthe objective was the destruction of the enemy's organized military\r\nforce on shore. At Grenada the chosen objective was the possession of\r\na piece of territory of no great military value; for it must be\r\nremarked that all these smaller Antilles, if held in force at all,\r\nmultiplied large detachments, whose mutual support depended wholly\r\nupon the navy. These large detachments were liable to be crushed\r\nseparately, if not supported by the navy; and if naval superiority is\r\nto be maintained, the enemy's navy must be crushed. Grenada, near and\r\nto leeward of Barbadoes and Sta. Lucia, both held strongly by the\r\nEnglish, was peculiarly weak to the French; but sound military policy\r\nfor all these islands demanded one or two strongly fortified and\r\ngarrisoned naval bases, and dependence for the rest upon the fleet.\r\nBeyond this, security against attacks by single cruisers and\r\nprivateers alone was needed.\r\n\r\nSuch were the objectives in dispute. What was the determining factor\r\nin this strife? Surely the navy, the organized military force afloat.\r\nCornwallis's fate depended absolutely upon the sea. It is useless to\r\nspeculate upon the result, had the odds on the 5th of September, 1781,\r\nin favor of De Grasse, been reversed; if the French, instead of five\r\nships more, had had five ships less than the English. As it was, De\r\nGrasse, when that fight began, had a superiority over the English\r\nequal to the result of a hard-won fight. The question then was, should\r\nhe risk the almost certain decisive victory over the organized enemy's\r\nforce ashore, for the sake of a much more doubtful advantage over the\r\norganized force afloat? This was not a question of Yorktown, but of\r\nCornwallis and his army; there is a great deal in the way things are\r\nput.\r\n\r\nSo stated,--and the statement needs no modifications,--there can be\r\nbut one answer. Let it be remarked clearly, however, that _both_ De\r\nGrasse's alternatives brought before him the organized forces as the\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\nNot so with D'Estaing at Grenada. His superiority in numbers over the\r\nEnglish was nearly as great as that of De Grasse; his alternative\r\nobjectives were the organized force afloat and a small island,\r\nfertile, but militarily unimportant. Grenada is said to have been a\r\nstrong position for defence; but intrinsic strength does not give\r\nimportance, if the position has not strategic value. To save the\r\nisland, he refused to use an enormous advantage fortune had given him\r\nover the fleet. Yet upon the strife between the two navies depended\r\nthe tenure of the islands. Seriously to hold the West India Islands\r\nrequired, first, a powerful seaport, which the French had; second, the\r\ncontrol of the sea. For the latter it was necessary, not to multiply\r\ndetachments in the islands, but to destroy the enemy's navy, which may\r\nbe accurately called the army in the field. The islands were but rich\r\ntowns; and not more than one or two fortified towns, or posts, were\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nIt may safely be said that the principle which led to D'Estaing's\r\naction was not, to say the least, unqualifiedly correct; for it led\r\nhim wrong. In the case of Yorktown, the principle as stated by\r\nRamatuelle is not the _justifying_ reason of De Grasse's conduct,\r\nthough it likely enough was the _real_ reason. What justified De\r\nGrasse was that, the event depending upon the unshaken control of the\r\nsea, for a short time only, he already had it by his greater numbers.\r\nHad the numbers been equal, loyalty to the military duty of the hour\r\nmust have forced him to fight, to stop the attempt which the English\r\nadmiral would certainly have made. The destruction of a few ships, as\r\nRamatuelle slightingly puts it, gives just that superiority to which\r\nthe happy result at Yorktown was due. As a general principle, this is\r\nundoubtedly a better objective than that pursued by the French. Of\r\ncourse, exceptions will be found; but those exceptions will probably\r\nbe where, as at Yorktown, the military force is struck at directly\r\nelsewhere, or, as at Port Mahon, a desirable and powerful base of that\r\nforce is at stake; though even at Mahon it is doubtful whether the\r\nprudence was not misplaced. Had Hawke or Boscawen met with Byng's\r\ndisaster, they would not have gone to Gibraltar to repair it, unless\r\nthe French admiral had followed up his first blow with others,\r\nincreasing their disability.\r\n\r\nGrenada was no doubt very dear in the eyes of D'Estaing, because it\r\nwas his only success. After making the failures at the Delaware, at\r\nNew York, and at Rhode Island, with the mortifying affair at Sta.\r\nLucia, it is difficult to understand the confidence in him expressed\r\nby some French writers. Gifted with a brilliant and contagious\r\npersonal daring, he distinguished himself most highly, when an\r\nadmiral, by leading in person assaults upon intrenchments at Sta.\r\nLucia and Grenada, and a few months later in the unsuccessful attack\r\nupon Savannah.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of the French navy in the winter of 1778-79, the\r\nEnglish, controlling now the sea with a few of their ships that had\r\nnot gone to the West Indies, determined to shift the scene of the\r\ncontinental war to the Southern States, where there was believed to be\r\na large number of loyalists. The expedition was directed upon Georgia,\r\nand was so far successful that Savannah fell into their hands in the\r\nlast days of 1778. The whole State speedily submitted. Operations were\r\nthence extended into South Carolina, but failed to bring about the\r\ncapture of Charleston.\r\n\r\nWord of these events was sent to D'Estaing in the West Indies,\r\naccompanied by urgent representations of the danger to the Carolinas,\r\nand the murmurings of the people against the French, who were accused\r\nof forsaking their allies, having rendered them no service, but on the\r\ncontrary having profited by the cordial help of the Bostonians to\r\nrefit their crippled fleet. There was a sting of truth in the alleged\r\nfailure to help, which impelled D'Estaing to disregard the orders\r\nactually in his hands to return at once to Europe with certain ships.\r\nInstead of obeying them he sailed for the American coast with\r\ntwenty-two ships-of-the-line, having in view two objects,--the relief\r\nof the Southern States and an attack upon New York in conjunction with\r\nWashington's army.\r\n\r\nArriving off the coast of Georgia on the 1st of September, D'Estaing\r\ntook the English wholly at unawares; but the fatal lack of promptness,\r\nwhich had previously marked the command of this very daring man, again\r\nbetrayed his good fortune. Dallying at first before Savannah, the\r\nfleeting of precious days again brought on a change of conditions, and\r\nthe approach of the bad-weather season impelled him, too slow at\r\nfirst, into a premature assault. In it he displayed his accustomed\r\ngallantry, fighting at the head of his column, as did the American\r\ngeneral; but the result was a bloody repulse. The siege was raised,\r\nand D'Estaing sailed at once for France, not only giving up his\r\nproject upon New York, but abandoning the Southern States to the\r\nenemy. The value of this help from the great sea power of France, thus\r\ncruelly dangled before the eyes of the Americans only to be withdrawn,\r\nwas shown by the action of the English, who abandoned Newport in the\r\nutmost haste when they learned the presence of the French fleet.\r\nWithdrawal had been before decided upon, but D'Estaing's coming\r\nconverted it into flight.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of D'Estaing, which involved that of the whole\r\nFrench fleet,--for the ships which did not go back to France returned\r\nto the West Indies,--the English resumed the attack upon the Southern\r\nStates, which had for a moment been suspended. The fleet and army left\r\nNew York for Georgia in the last weeks of 1779, and after assembling\r\nat Tybee, moved upon Charleston by way of Edisto. The powerlessness of\r\nthe Americans upon the sea left this movement unembarrassed save by\r\nsingle cruisers, which picked up some stragglers,--affording another\r\nlesson of the petty results of a merely cruising warfare. The siege of\r\nCharleston began at the end of March,--the English ships soon after\r\npassing the bar and Fort Moultrie without serious damage, and\r\nanchoring within gunshot of the place. Fort Moultrie was soon and\r\neasily reduced by land approaches, and the city itself was surrendered\r\non the 12th of May, after a siege of forty days. The whole State was\r\nthen quickly overrun and brought into military subjection.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of D'Estaing's late fleet were joined by a reinforcement\r\nfrom France under the Comte de Guichen, who assumed chief command in\r\nthe West Indian seas March 22, 1780. The next day he sailed for Sta.\r\nLucia, which he hoped to find unprepared; but a crusty, hard-fighting\r\nold admiral of the traditional English type, Sir Hyde Parker, had so\r\nsettled himself at the anchorage, with sixteen ships, that Guichen\r\nwith his twenty-two would not attack. The opportunity, if it were one,\r\ndid not recur. De Guichen, returning to Martinique, anchored there on\r\nthe 27th; and the same day Parker at Sta. Lucia was joined by the new\r\nEnglish commander-in-chief, Rodney.\r\n\r\nThis since celebrated, but then only distinguished, admiral was\r\nsixty-two years old at the time of assuming a command where he was to\r\nwin an undying fame. Of distinguished courage and professional skill,\r\nbut with extravagant if not irregular habits, money embarrassments had\r\ndetained him in exile in France at the time the war began. A boast of\r\nhis ability to deal with the French fleet, if circumstances enabled\r\nhim to go back to England, led a French nobleman who heard it to\r\nassume his debts, moved by feelings in which chivalry and national\r\npique probably bore equal shares. Upon his return he was given a\r\ncommand, and sailed, in January, 1780, with a fleet of twenty\r\nships-of-the-line, to relieve Gibraltar, then closely invested. Off\r\nCadiz, with a good luck for which he was proverbial, he fell in with a\r\nSpanish fleet of eleven ships-of-the-line, which awkwardly held their\r\nground until too late to fly.[139] Throwing out the signal for a\r\ngeneral chase, and cutting in to leeward of the enemy, between them\r\nand their port, Rodney, despite a dark and stormy night, succeeded in\r\nblowing up one ship and taking six. Hastening on, he relieved\r\nGibraltar, placing it out of all danger from want; and then, leaving\r\nthe prizes and the bulk of his fleet, sailed with the rest for his\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nDespite his brilliant personal courage and professional skill, which\r\nin the matter of tactics was far in advance of his contemporaries in\r\nEngland, Rodney, as a commander-in-chief, belongs rather to the wary,\r\ncautious school of the French tacticians than to the impetuous,\r\nunbounded eagerness of Nelson. As in Tourville we have seen the\r\ndesperate fighting of the seventeenth century, unwilling to leave its\r\nenemy, merging into the formal, artificial--we may almost say\r\ntrifling--parade tactics of the eighteenth, so in Rodney we shall see\r\nthe transition from those ceremonious duels to an action which, while\r\nskilful in conception, aimed at serious results. For it would be\r\nunjust to Rodney to press the comparison to the French admirals of his\r\nday. With a skill that De Guichen recognized as soon as they crossed\r\nswords, Rodney meant mischief, not idle flourishes. Whatever\r\nincidental favors fortune might bestow by the way, the objective from\r\nwhich his eye never wandered was the French fleet,--the organized\r\nmilitary force of the enemy on the sea. And on the day when Fortune\r\nforsook the opponent who had neglected her offers, when the conqueror\r\nof Cornwallis failed to strike while he had Rodney at a disadvantage,\r\nthe latter won a victory which redeemed England from the depths of\r\nanxiety, and restored to her by one blow all those islands which the\r\ncautious tactics of the allies had for a moment gained, save only\r\nTobago.\r\n\r\nDe Guichen and Rodney met for the first time on the 17th of April,\r\n1780, three weeks after the arrival of the latter. The French fleet\r\nwas beating to windward in the Channel between Martinique and\r\nDominica, when the enemy was made in the southeast. A day was spent in\r\nmanoeuvring for the weather-gage, which Rodney got. The two fleets\r\nbeing now well to leeward of the islands[140] (Plate XI.), both on the\r\nstarboard tack heading to the northward and the French on the lee bow\r\nof the English, Rodney, who was carrying a press of sail, signalled to\r\nhis fleet that he meant to attack the enemy's rear and centre with his\r\nwhole force; and when he had reached the position he thought suitable,\r\nordered them to keep away eight points (90°) together (A, A, A). De\r\nGuichen, seeing the danger of the rear, wore his fleet all together\r\nand stood down to succor it. Rodney, finding himself foiled, hauled up\r\nagain on the same tack as the enemy, both fleets now heading to the\r\nsouthward and eastward.[141] Later, he again made signal for battle,\r\nfollowed an hour after, just at noon, by the order (quoting his own\r\ndespatch), \"for every ship to bear down and steer for her opposite in\r\nthe enemy's line.\" This, which sounds like the old story of ship to\r\nship, Rodney explains to have meant her opposite at the moment, not\r\nher opposite in numerical order. His own words are: \"In a slanting\r\nposition, that my leading ships might attack the van ships of the\r\nenemy's centre division, and the whole British fleet be opposed to\r\nonly two thirds of the enemy\" (B, B). The difficulty and\r\nmisunderstanding which followed seem to have sprung mainly from the\r\ndefective character of the signal book. Instead of doing as the\r\nadmiral wished, the leading ships (a) carried sail so as to reach\r\ntheir supposed station abreast their numerical opposite in the order.\r\nRodney stated afterward that when he bore down the second time, the\r\nFrench fleet was in a very extended line of battle; and that, had his\r\norders been obeyed, the centre and rear must have been disabled before\r\nthe van could have joined.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. XI. RODNEY & GUICHEN APRIL 17, 1780.]\r\n\r\nThere seems every reason to believe that Rodney's intentions\r\nthroughout were to double on the French, as asserted. The failure\r\nsprang from the signal-book and tactical inefficiency of the fleet;\r\nfor which he, having lately joined, was not answerable. But the\r\nugliness of his fence was so apparent to De Guichen, that he\r\nexclaimed, when the English fleet kept away the first time, that six\r\nor seven of his ships were gone; and sent word to Rodney that if his\r\nsignals had been obeyed he would have had him for his prisoner.[142] A\r\nmore convincing proof that he recognized the dangerousness of his\r\nenemy is to be found in the fact that he took care not to have the\r\nlee-gage in their subsequent encounters. Rodney's careful plans being\r\nupset, he showed that with them he carried all the stubborn courage of\r\nthe most downright fighter; taking his own ship close to the enemy and\r\nceasing only when the latter hauled off, her foremast and mainyard\r\ngone, and her hull so damaged that she could hardly be kept afloat.\r\n\r\nAn incident of this battle mentioned by French writers and by\r\nBotta,[143] who probably drew upon French authorities, but not found\r\nin the English accounts, shows the critical nature of the attack in\r\nthe apprehension of the French. According to them, Rodney, marking a\r\ngap in their order due to a ship in rear of the French admiral being\r\nout of station, tried to break through (b); but the captain of the\r\n\"Destin,\" seventy-four, pressed up under more sail and threw himself\r\nacross the path of the English ninety-gun ship.\r\n\r\n    \"The action of the 'Destin' was justly praised,\" says\r\n    Lapeyrouse-Bonfils. \"The fleet ran the danger of almost certain\r\n    defeat, but for the bravery of M. de Goimpy. Such, after the\r\n    affair, was the opinion of the whole French squadron. Yet,\r\n    admitting that our line was broken, what disasters then would\r\n    necessarily threaten the fleet? Would it not always have been\r\n    easy for our rear to remedy the accident by promptly standing on\r\n    to fill the place of the vessels cut off? That movement would\r\n    necessarily have brought about a _mêlée_, which would have\r\n    turned to the advantage of the fleet having the bravest and most\r\n    devoted captains. But then, as under the empire, it was an\r\n    acknowledged principle that ships cut off were ships taken, and\r\n    the belief wrought its own fulfilment.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of breaking an enemy's line, or order-of-battle, depends\r\nupon several conditions. The essential idea is to divide the opposing\r\nforce by penetrating through an interval found, or made, in it, and\r\nthen to concentrate upon that one of the fractions which can be least\r\neasily helped by the other. In a column of ships this will usually be\r\nthe rear. The compactness of the order attacked, the number of the\r\nships cut off, the length of time during which they can be isolated\r\nand outnumbered, will all affect the results. A very great factor in\r\nthe issue will be the moral effect, the confusion introduced into a\r\nline thus broken. Ships coming up toward the break are stopped, the\r\nrear doubles up, while the ships ahead continue their course. Such a\r\nmoment is critical, and calls for instant action; but the men are rare\r\nwho in an unforeseen emergency can see, and at once take the right\r\ncourse, especially if, being subordinates, they incur responsibility.\r\nIn such a scene of confusion the English, without presumption, hoped\r\nto profit by their better seamanship; for it is not only \"courage and\r\ndevotion,\" but skill, which then tells. All these effects of \"breaking\r\nthe line\" received illustration in Rodney's great battle in 1782.\r\n\r\nDe Guichen and Rodney met twice again in the following month, but on\r\nneither occasion did the French admiral take the favorite lee-gage of\r\nhis nation. Meanwhile a Spanish fleet of twelve ships-of-the-line was\r\non its way to join the French. Rodney cruised to windward of\r\nMartinique to intercept them; but the Spanish admiral kept a northerly\r\ncourse, sighted Guadeloupe, and thence sent a despatch to De Guichen,\r\nwho joined his allies and escorted them into port. The great\r\npreponderance of the coalition, in numbers, raised the fears of the\r\nEnglish islands; but lack of harmony led to delays and hesitations, a\r\nterrible epidemic raged in the Spanish squadron, and the intended\r\noperations came to nothing. In August De Guichen sailed for France\r\nwith fifteen ships. Rodney, ignorant of his destination, and anxious\r\nabout both North America and Jamaica, divided his fleet, leaving one\r\nhalf in the islands, and with the remainder sailing for New York,\r\nwhere he arrived on the 12th of September. The risk thus run was very\r\ngreat, and scarcely justifiable; but no ill effect followed the\r\ndispersal of forces.[144] Had De Guichen intended to turn upon\r\nJamaica, or, as was expected by Washington, upon New York, neither\r\npart of Rodney's fleet could well have withstood him. Two chances of\r\ndisaster, instead of one, were run, by being in small force on two\r\nfields instead of in full force on one.\r\n\r\nRodney's anxiety about North America was well grounded. On the 12th of\r\nJuly of this year the long expected French succor arrived,--five\r\nthousand French troops under Rochambeau and seven ships-of-the-line\r\nunder De Ternay. Hence the English, though still superior at sea, felt\r\nforced to concentrate at New York, and were unable to strengthen their\r\noperations in Carolina. The difficulty and distance of movements by\r\nland gave such an advantage to sea power that Lafayette urged the\r\nFrench government further to increase the fleet; but it was still\r\nnaturally and properly attentive to its own immediate interests in the\r\nAntilles. It was not yet time to deliver America.\r\n\r\nRodney, having escaped the great hurricane of October, 1780, by his\r\nabsence, returned to the West Indies later in the year, and soon after\r\nheard of the war between England and Holland; which, proceeding from\r\ncauses which will be mentioned later, was declared December 20, 1780.\r\nThe admiral at once seized the Dutch islands of St. Eustatius and St.\r\nMartin, besides numerous merchant-ships, with property amounting in\r\nall to fifteen million dollars. These islands, while still neutral,\r\nhad played a rôle similar to that of Nassau during the American Civil\r\nWar, and had become a great depot of contraband goods, immense\r\nquantities of which now fell into the English hands.\r\n\r\nThe year 1780 had been gloomy for the cause of the United States. The\r\nbattle of Camden had seemed to settle the English yoke on South\r\nCarolina, and the enemy formed high hopes of controlling both North\r\nCarolina and Virginia. The treason of Arnold following had increased\r\nthe depression, which was but partially relieved by the victory at\r\nKing's Mountain. The substantial aid of French troops was the most\r\ncheerful spot in the situation. Yet even that had a checkered light,\r\nthe second division of the intended help being blocked in Brest by the\r\nEnglish fleet; while the final failure of De Guichen to appear, and\r\nRodney coming in his stead, made the hopes of the campaign fruitless.\r\n\r\nA period of vehement and decisive action was, however, at hand. At the\r\nend of March, 1781, the Comte de Grasse sailed from Brest with\r\ntwenty-six ships-of-the-line and a large convoy. When off the Azores,\r\nfive ships parted company for the East Indies, under Suffren, of whom\r\nmore will be heard later on. De Grasse came in sight of Martinique on\r\nthe 28th of April. Admiral Hood (Rodney having remained behind at St.\r\nEustatius) was blockading before Fort Royal, the French port and\r\narsenal on the lee side of the island, in which were four\r\nships-of-the-line, when his lookouts reported the enemy's fleet. Hood\r\nhad two objects before him,--one to prevent the junction of the four\r\nblockaded ships with the approaching fleet, the other to keep the\r\nlatter from getting between him and Gros Ilot Bay in Sta. Lucia.\r\nInstead of effecting this in the next twenty-four hours, by beating to\r\nwindward of the Diamond Rock, his fleet got so far to leeward that De\r\nGrasse, passing through the channel on the 29th, headed up for Fort\r\nRoyal, keeping his convoy between the fleet and the island. For this\r\nfalse position Hood was severely blamed by Rodney, but it may have\r\nbeen due to light winds and the lee current. However that be, the four\r\nships in Fort Royal got under way and joined the main body. The\r\nEnglish had now only eighteen ships to the French twenty-four, and the\r\nlatter were to windward; but though thus in the proportion of four to\r\nthree, and having the power to attack, De Grasse would not do it. The\r\nfear of exposing his convoy prevented him from running the chance of a\r\nserious engagement. Great must have been his distrust of his forces,\r\none would say. When is a navy to fight, if this was not a time? He\r\ncarried on a distant cannonade, with results so far against the\r\nEnglish as to make his backwardness yet more extraordinary. Can a\r\npolicy or a tradition which justifies such a line of conduct be good?\r\n\r\nThe following day, April 30, De Grasse, having thrown away his chance,\r\nattempted to follow Hood; but the latter had no longer any reason for\r\nfighting, and his original inferiority was increased by the severe\r\ninjuries of some ships on the 29th. De Grasse could not overtake him,\r\nowing to the inferior speed of his fleet, many of the ships not being\r\ncoppered,--a fact worthy of note, as French vessels by model and size\r\nwere generally faster than English; but this superiority was\r\nsacrificed through the delay of the government in adopting the new\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nHood rejoined Rodney at Antigua; and De Grasse, after remaining a\r\nshort time at Fort Royal, made an attempt upon Gros Ilot Bay, the\r\npossession of which by the English kept all the movements of his fleet\r\nunder surveillance. Foiled here, he moved against Tobago, which\r\nsurrendered June 2, 1781. Sailing thence, after some minor operations,\r\nhe anchored on the 26th of July at Cap Français (now Cape Haytien), in\r\nthe island of Hayti. Here he found awaiting him a French frigate from\r\nthe United States, bearing despatches from Washington and Rochambeau,\r\nupon which he was to take the most momentous action that fell to any\r\nFrench admiral during the war.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of the Southern States by the English, beginning in\r\nGeorgia and followed by the taking of Charleston and the military\r\ncontrol of the two extreme States, had been pressed on to the\r\nnorthward by way of Camden into North Carolina. On the 16th of August,\r\n1780, General Gates was totally defeated at Camden; and during the\r\nfollowing nine months the English under Cornwallis persisted in their\r\nattempts to overrun North Carolina. These operations, the narration of\r\nwhich is foreign to our immediate subject, had ended by forcing\r\nCornwallis, despite many successes in actual encounter, to fall back\r\nexhausted toward the seaboard, and finally upon Wilmington, in which\r\nplace depots for such a contingency had been established. His\r\nopponent, General Greene, then turned the American troops toward South\r\nCarolina. Cornwallis, too weak to dream of controlling, or even\r\npenetrating, into the interior of an unfriendly country, had now to\r\nchoose between returning to Charleston, to assure there and in South\r\nCarolina the shaken British power, and moving northward again into\r\nVirginia, there to join hands with a small expeditionary force\r\noperating on the James River under Generals Phillips and Arnold. To\r\nfall back would be a confession that the weary marching and fighting\r\nof months past had been without results, and the general readily\r\nconvinced himself that the Chesapeake was the proper seat of war, even\r\nif New York itself had to be abandoned. The commander-in-chief, Sir\r\nHenry Clinton, by no means shared this opinion, upon which was\r\njustified a step taken without asking him. \"Operations in the\r\nChesapeake,\" he wrote, \"are attended with great risk unless we are\r\nsure of a permanent superiority at sea. I tremble for the fatal\r\nconsequences that may ensue.\" For Cornwallis, taking the matter into\r\nhis own hands, had marched from Wilmington on the 25th of April, 1781,\r\njoining the British already at Petersburg on the 20th of May. The\r\nforces thus united numbered seven thousand men. Driven back from the\r\nopen country of South Carolina into Charleston, there now remained two\r\ncentres of British power,--at New York and in the Chesapeake. With New\r\nJersey and Pennsylvania in the hands of the Americans, communication\r\nbetween the two depended wholly upon the sea.\r\n\r\nDespite his unfavorable criticism of Cornwallis's action, Clinton had\r\nhimself already risked a large detachment in the Chesapeake. A body of\r\nsixteen hundred men under Benedict Arnold had ravaged the country of\r\nthe James and burned Richmond in January of this same year. In the\r\nhopes of capturing Arnold, Lafayette had been sent to Virginia with a\r\nnucleus of twelve hundred troops, and on the evening of the 8th of\r\nMarch the French squadron at Newport sailed, in concerted movement, to\r\ncontrol the waters of the bay. Admiral Arbuthnot, commanding the\r\nEnglish fleet lying in Gardiner's Bay,[145] learned the departure by\r\nhis lookouts, and started in pursuit on the morning of the 10th,\r\nthirty-six hours later. Favored either by diligence or luck, he made\r\nsuch good time that when the two fleets came in sight of each other, a\r\nlittle outside of the capes of the Chesapeake, the English were\r\nleading[146] (Plate XII., A, A). They at once went about to meet their\r\nenemy, who, on his part, formed a line-of-battle. The wind at this\r\ntime was west, so that neither could head directly into the bay.\r\n\r\nThe two fleets were nearly equal in strength, there being eight ships\r\non each side; but the English had one ninety-gun ship, while of the\r\nFrench one was only a heavy frigate, which was put into the line.\r\nNevertheless, the case was eminently one for the general French policy\r\nto have determined the action of a vigorous chief, and the failure to\r\nsee the matter through must fall upon the good-will of Commodore\r\nDestouches, or upon some other cause than that preference for the\r\nulterior objects of the operations, of which the reader of French\r\nnaval history hears so much. The weather was boisterous and\r\nthreatening, and the wind, after hauling once or twice, settled down\r\nto northeast, with a big sea, but was then fair for entering the bay.\r\nThe two fleets were by this time both on the port tack standing out to\r\nsea, the French leading, and about a point on the weather bow of the\r\nEnglish (B, B). From this position they wore in succession (c) ahead\r\nof the latter, taking the lee-gage, and thus gaining the use of their\r\nlower batteries, which the heavy sea forbade to the weather-gage. The\r\nEnglish stood on till abreast the enemy's line (a, b), when they wore\r\ntogether, and soon after attacked in the usual manner, and with the\r\nusual results (C). The three van ships were very badly injured aloft,\r\nbut in their turn, throwing their force mainly on the two leaders of\r\nthe enemy, crippled them seriously in hulls and rigging. The French\r\nvan then kept away, and Arbuthnot, in perplexity, ordered his van to\r\nhaul the wind again. M. Destouches now executed a very neat movement\r\nby defiling. Signalling his van to haul up on the other tack (e), he\r\nled the rest of his squadron by the disabled English ships, and after\r\ngiving them the successive broadsides of his comparatively fresh\r\nships, wore (d), and out to sea (D). This was the end of the battle,\r\nin which the English certainly got the worst; but with their usual\r\ntenacity of purpose, being unable to pursue their enemy afloat, they\r\nsteered for the bay (D), made the junction with Arnold, and thus broke\r\nup the plans of the French and Americans, from which so much had been\r\nhoped by Washington. There can be no doubt, after careful reading of\r\nthe accounts, that after the fighting the French were in better force\r\nthan the English, and they in fact claimed the victory; yet the\r\nulterior objects of the expedition did not tempt them again to try the\r\nissue with a fleet of about their own size.[147]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. XII. ARBUTHNOT & DESTOUCHES. MARCH 16, 1781.]\r\n\r\nThe way of the sea being thus open and held in force, two thousand\r\nmore English troops sailing from New York reached Virginia on the 26th\r\nof March, and the subsequent arrival of Cornwallis in May raised the\r\nnumber to seven thousand. The operations of the contending forces\r\nduring the spring and summer months, in which Lafayette commanded the\r\nAmericans, do not concern our subject. Early in August, Cornwallis,\r\nacting under orders from Clinton, withdrew his troops into the\r\npeninsula between the York and James rivers, and occupied Yorktown.\r\n\r\nWashington and Rochambeau had met on the 21st of May, and decided that\r\nthe situation demanded that the effort of the French West Indian\r\nfleet, when it came, should be directed against either New York or the\r\nChesapeake. This was the tenor of the despatch found by De Grasse at\r\nCap Français, and meantime the allied generals drew their troops\r\ntoward New York, where they would be on hand for the furtherance of\r\none object, and nearer the second if they had to make for it.\r\n\r\nIn either case the result, in the opinion both of Washington and of\r\nthe French government, depended upon superior sea power; but\r\nRochambeau had privately notified the admiral that his own preference\r\nwas for the Chesapeake as the scene of the intended operations, and\r\nmoreover the French government had declined to furnish the means for a\r\nformal siege of New York.[148] The enterprise therefore assumed the\r\nform of an extensive military combination, dependent upon ease and\r\nrapidity of movement, and upon blinding the eyes of the enemy to the\r\nreal objective,--purposes to which the peculiar qualities of a navy\r\nadmirably lent themselves. The shorter distance to be traversed, the\r\ngreater depth of water and easier pilotage of the Chesapeake, were\r\nfurther reasons which would commend the scheme to the judgment of a\r\nseaman; and De Grasse readily accepted it, without making difficulties\r\nor demanding modifications which would have involved discussion and\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nHaving made his decision, the French admiral acted with great good\r\njudgment, promptitude, and vigor. The same frigate that brought\r\ndespatches from Washington was sent back, so that by August 15th the\r\nallied generals knew of the intended coming of the fleet. Thirty-five\r\nhundred soldiers were spared by the governor of Cap Français, upon the\r\ncondition of a Spanish squadron anchoring at the place, which De\r\nGrasse procured. He also raised from the governor of Havana the money\r\nurgently needed by the Americans; and finally, instead of weakening\r\nhis force by sending convoys to France, as the court had wished, he\r\ntook every available ship to the Chesapeake. To conceal his coming as\r\nlong as possible, he passed through the Bahama Channel, as a less\r\nfrequented route, and on the 30th of August anchored in Lynnhaven Bay,\r\njust within the capes of the Chesapeake, with twenty-eight\r\nships-of-the-line. Three days before, August 27, the French squadron\r\nat Newport, eight ships-of-the-line with four frigates and eighteen\r\ntransports under M. de Barras, sailed for the rendezvous; making,\r\nhowever, a wide circuit out to sea to avoid the English. This course\r\nwas the more necessary as the French siege-artillery was with it. The\r\ntroops under Washington and Rochambeau had crossed the Hudson on the\r\n24th of August, moving toward the head of Chesapeake Bay. Thus the\r\ndifferent armed forces, both land and sea, were converging toward\r\ntheir objective, Cornwallis.\r\n\r\nThe English were unfortunate in all directions. Rodney, learning of De\r\nGrasse's departure, sent fourteen ships-of-the-line under Admiral Hood\r\nto North America, and himself sailed for England in August, on account\r\nof ill health. Hood, going by the direct route, reached the Chesapeake\r\nthree days before De Grasse, looked into the bay, and finding it empty\r\nwent on to New York. There he met five ships-of-the-line under Admiral\r\nGraves, who, being senior officer, took command of the whole force and\r\nsailed on the 31st of August for the Chesapeake, hoping to intercept\r\nDe Barras before he could join De Grasse. It was not till two days\r\nlater that Sir Henry Clinton was persuaded that the allied armies had\r\ngone against Cornwallis, and had too far the start to be overtaken.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Graves was painfully surprised, on making the Chesapeake, to\r\nfind anchored there a fleet which from its numbers could only be an\r\nenemy's. Nevertheless, he stood in to meet it, and as De Grasse got\r\nunder way, allowing his ships to be counted, the sense of numerical\r\ninferiority--nineteen to twenty-four--did not deter the English\r\nadmiral from attacking. The clumsiness of his method, however,\r\nbetrayed his gallantry; many of his ships were roughly handled,\r\nwithout any advantage being gained. De Grasse, expecting De Barras,\r\nremained outside five days, keeping the English fleet in play without\r\ncoming to action; then returning to port he found De Barras safely at\r\nanchor. Graves went back to New York, and with him disappeared the\r\nlast hope of succor that was to gladden Cornwallis's eyes. The siege\r\nwas steadily endured, but the control of the sea made only one issue\r\npossible, and the English forces were surrendered October 19, 1781.\r\nWith this disaster the hope of subduing the colonies died in England.\r\nThe conflict flickered through a year longer, but no serious\r\noperations were undertaken.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of the English operations, which ended thus\r\nunfortunately, there was both bad management and ill fortune. Hood's\r\ndetachment might have been strengthened by several ships from Jamaica,\r\nhad Rodney's orders been carried out.[149] The despatch-ship, also,\r\nsent by him to Admiral Graves commanding in New York, found that\r\nofficer absent on a cruise to the eastward, with a view to intercept\r\ncertain very important supplies which had been forwarded by the\r\nAmerican agent in France. The English Court had laid great stress upon\r\ncutting off this convoy; but, with the knowledge that he had of the\r\nforce accompanying it, the admiral was probably ill-advised in leaving\r\nhis headquarters himself, with all his fleet, at the time when the\r\napproach of the hurricane season in the West Indies directed the\r\nactive operations of the navies toward the continent. In consequence\r\nof his absence, although Rodney's despatches were at once sent on by\r\nthe senior officer in New York, the vessel carrying them being driven\r\nashore by enemy's cruisers, Graves did not learn their contents until\r\nhis return to port, August 16. The information sent by Hood of his\r\ncoming was also intercepted. After Hood's arrival, it does not appear\r\nthat there was avoidable delay in going to sea; but there does seem to\r\nhave been misjudgment in the direction given to the fleet. It was\r\nknown that De Barras had sailed from Newport with eight ships, bound\r\nprobably for the Chesapeake, certainly to effect a junction with De\r\nGrasse; and it has been judiciously pointed out that if Graves had\r\ntaken up his cruising-ground near the Capes, but out of sight of land,\r\nhe could hardly have failed to fall in with him in overwhelming force.\r\nKnowing what is now known, this would undoubtedly have been the proper\r\nthing to do; but the English admiral had imperfect information. It\r\nwas nowhere expected that the French would bring nearly the force they\r\ndid; and Graves lost information, which he ought to have received, as\r\nto their numbers, by the carelessness of his cruisers stationed off\r\nthe Chesapeake. These had been ordered to keep under way, but were\r\nboth at anchor under Cape Henry when De Grasse's appearance cut off\r\ntheir escape. One was captured, the other driven up York River. No\r\nsingle circumstance contributed more to the general result than the\r\nneglect of these two subordinate officers, by which Graves lost that\r\nall-important information. It can readily be conceived how his\r\nmovements might have been affected, had he known two days earlier that\r\nDe Grasse had brought twenty-seven or twenty-eight sail of the line;\r\nhow natural would have been the conclusion, first, to waylay De\r\nBarras, with whom his own nineteen could more than cope. \"Had Admiral\r\nGraves succeeded in capturing that squadron, it would have greatly\r\nparalyzed the besieging army [it had the siege train on board], if it\r\nwould not have prevented its operations altogether; it would have put\r\nthe two fleets nearly on an equality in point of numbers, would have\r\narrested the progress of the French arms for the ensuing year in the\r\nWest Indies, and might possibly have created such a spirit of discord\r\nbetween the French and Americans[150] as would have sunk the latter\r\ninto the lowest depths of despair, from which they were only\r\nextricated by the arrival of the forces under De Grasse.\"[151] These\r\nare true and sober comments upon the naval strategy.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the admiral's tactics, it will be enough to say that the\r\nfleet was taken into battle nearly as Byng took his; that very similar\r\nmishaps resulted; and that, when attacking twenty-four ships with\r\nnineteen, seven, under that capable officer Hood, were not able to get\r\ninto action, owing to the dispositions made.\r\n\r\nOn the French side De Grasse must be credited with a degree of energy,\r\nforesight, and determination surprising in view of his failures at\r\nother times. The decision to take every ship with him, which made him\r\nindependent of any failure on the part of De Barras; the passage\r\nthrough the Bahama Channel to conceal his movements; the address with\r\nwhich he obtained the money and troops required, from the Spanish and\r\nthe French military authorities; the prevision which led him, as early\r\nas March 29, shortly after leaving Brest, to write to Rochambeau that\r\nAmerican coast pilots should be sent to Cap Français; the coolness\r\nwith which he kept Graves amused until De Barras's squadron had\r\nslipped in, are all points worthy of admiration. The French were also\r\nhelped by the admiral's power to detain the two hundred\r\nmerchant-ships, the \"West India trade,\" awaiting convoy at Cap\r\nFrançais, where they remained from July till November, when the close\r\nof operations left him at liberty to convoy them with ships-of-war.\r\nThe incident illustrates one weakness of a mercantile country with\r\nrepresentative government, compared with a purely military nation. \"If\r\nthe British government,\" wrote an officer of that day, \"had\r\nsanctioned, or a British admiral had adopted, such a measure, the one\r\nwould have been turned out and the other hanged.\"[152] Rodney at the\r\nsame time had felt it necessary to detach five ships-of-the-line with\r\nconvoys, while half a dozen more went home with the trade from\r\nJamaica.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to criticise the division of the English fleet between\r\nthe West Indies and North America in the successive years 1780 and\r\n1781, than to realize the embarrassment of the situation. This\r\nembarrassment was but the reflection of the military difficulty of\r\nEngland's position, all over the world, in this great and unequal war.\r\nEngland was everywhere outmatched and embarrassed, as she has always\r\nbeen as an empire, by the number of her exposed points. In Europe the\r\nChannel fleet was more than once driven into its ports by overwhelming\r\nforces. Gibraltar, closely blockaded by land and sea, was only kept\r\nalive in its desperate resistance by the skill of English seamen\r\ntriumphing over the inaptness and discords of their combined enemies.\r\nIn the East Indies, Sir Edward Hughes met in Suffren an opponent as\r\nsuperior to him in numbers as was De Grasse to Hood, and of far\r\ngreater ability. Minorca, abandoned by the home government, fell\r\nbefore superior strength, as has been seen to fall, one by one, the\r\nless important of the English Antilles. The position of England from\r\nthe time that France and Spain opened their maritime war was\r\neverywhere defensive, except in North America; and was therefore, from\r\nthe military point of view, essentially false. She everywhere awaited\r\nattacks which the enemies, superior in every case, could make at their\r\nown choice and their own time. North America was really no exception\r\nto this rule, despite some offensive operations which in no way\r\ninjured her real, that is her naval, foes.\r\n\r\nThus situated, and putting aside questions of national pride or\r\nsensitiveness, what did military wisdom prescribe to England? The\r\nquestion would afford an admirable study to a military inquirer, and\r\nis not to be answered off-hand, but certain evident truths may be\r\npointed out. In the first place, it should have been determined what\r\npart of the assailed empire was most necessary to be preserved. After\r\nthe British islands themselves, the North American colonies were the\r\nmost valuable possessions in the eyes of the England of that day. Next\r\nshould have been decided what others by their natural importance were\r\nbest worth preserving, and by their own inherent strength, or that of\r\nthe empire, which was mainly naval strength, could most surely be\r\nheld. In the Mediterranean, for instance, Gibraltar and Mahon were\r\nboth very valuable positions. Could both be held? Which was more\r\neasily to be reached and supported by the fleet? If both could not\r\nprobably be held, one should have been frankly abandoned, and the\r\nforce and efforts necessary to its defence carried elsewhere. So in\r\nthe West Indies the evident strategic advantages of Barbadoes and Sta.\r\nLucia prescribed the abandonment of the other small islands by\r\ngarrisons as soon as the fleet was fairly outnumbered, if not before.\r\nThe case of so large an island as Jamaica must be studied separately,\r\nas well as with reference to the general question. Such an island may\r\nbe so far self-supporting as to defy any attack but one in great force\r\nand numbers, and that would rightly draw to it the whole English force\r\nfrom the windward stations at Barbadoes and Sta. Lucia.\r\n\r\nWith the defence thus concentrated, England's great weapon, the navy,\r\nshould have been vigorously used on the offensive. Experience has\r\ntaught that free nations, popular governments, will seldom dare wholly\r\nto remove the force that lies between an invader and its shores or\r\ncapital. Whatever the military wisdom, therefore, of sending the\r\nChannel fleet to seek the enemy before it united, the step may not\r\nhave been possible. But at points less vital the attack of the English\r\nshould have anticipated that of the allies. This was most especially\r\ntrue of that theatre of the war which has so far been considered. If\r\nNorth America was the first object, Jamaica and the other islands\r\nshould have been boldly risked. It is due to Rodney to say that he\r\nclaims that his orders to the admirals at Jamaica and New York were\r\ndisobeyed in 1781, and that to this was owing the inferiority in\r\nnumber of Graves's fleet.\r\n\r\nBut why, in 1780, when the departure of De Guichen for Europe left\r\nRodney markedly superior in numbers during his short visit to North\r\nAmerica, from September 14 to November 14, should no attempt have been\r\nmade to destroy the French detachment of seven ships-of-the-line in\r\nNewport? These ships had arrived there in July; but although they had\r\nat once strengthened their position by earthworks, great alarm was\r\nexcited by the news of Rodney's appearance off the coast. A fortnight\r\npassed by Rodney in New York and by the French in busy work, placed\r\nthe latter, in their own opinion, in a position to brave all the naval\r\nforce of England. \"We twice feared, and above all at the time of\r\nRodney's arrival,\" wrote the chief of staff of the French squadron,\r\n\"that the English might attack us in the road itself; and there was a\r\nspace of time during which such an undertaking would not have been an\r\nact of rashness. Now [October 20], the anchorage is fortified so that\r\nwe can there brave all the naval force of England.\"[153]\r\n\r\nThe position thus taken by the French was undoubtedly very\r\nstrong.[154] It formed a re-entrant angle of a little over ninety\r\ndegrees, contained by lines drawn from Goat Island to what was then\r\ncalled Brenton's Point, the site of the present Fort Adams on the one\r\nside, and to Rose Island on the other. On the right flank of the\r\nposition Rose Island received a battery of thirty-six 24-pounders;\r\nwhile twelve guns of the same size were placed on the left flank at\r\nBrenton's Point. Between Rose and Goat islands four ships, drawn up on\r\na west-northwest line, bore upon the entrance and raked an approaching\r\nfleet; while three others, between Goat Island and Brenton's Point,\r\ncrossed their fire at right angles with the former four.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the summer winds blow directly up the entrance,\r\noften with great force. There could be no question even of a\r\nconsiderably crippled attacking ship reaching her destined position,\r\nand when once confused with the enemy's line, the shore batteries\r\nwould be neutralized. The work on Rose Island certainly, that on\r\nBrenton's Point probably, had less height than the two upper batteries\r\nof a ship-of-the-line, and could be vastly outnumbered. They could not\r\nhave been casemated, and might indisputably have been silenced by the\r\ngrapeshot of the ships that could have been brought against them. Rose\r\nIsland could be approached on the front and on the west flank within\r\ntwo hundred yards, and on the north within half a mile. There was\r\nnothing to prevent this right flank of the French, including the line\r\nof ships, being enfiladed and crushed by the English ships taking\r\nposition west of Rose Island. The essential points of close range and\r\nsuperior height were thus possible to the English fleet, which\r\nnumbered twenty to the enemy's seven. If successful in destroying the\r\nshipping and reducing Rose Island, it could find anchorage farther up\r\nthe bay and await a favorable wind to retire. In the opinion of a\r\ndistinguished English naval officer of the day,[155] closely familiar\r\nwith the ground, there was no doubt of the success of an attack; and\r\nhe urged it frequently upon Rodney, offering himself to pilot the\r\nleading ship. The security felt by the French in this position, and\r\nthe acquiescence of the English in that security, mark clearly the\r\ndifference in spirit between this war and the wars of Nelson and\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, merely as an isolated operation, but in relation\r\nto the universal war, that such an attempt is here considered. England\r\nstood everywhere on the defensive, with inferior numbers. From such a\r\nposition there is no salvation except by action vigorous almost to\r\ndesperation. \"It is impossible for us,\" wrote with great truth the\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty to Rodney, \"to have a superior fleet in\r\nevery part; and unless our commanders-in-chief will take the great\r\nline, as you do, and consider the king's whole dominions under their\r\ncare, our enemies must find us unprepared somewhere, and carry their\r\npoint against us.\"[156] Attacks which considered in themselves alone\r\nmight be thought unjustifiable, were imposed upon English commanders.\r\nThe allied navy was the key of the situation, and its large\r\ndetachments, as at Newport, should have been crushed at any risk. The\r\neffect of such a line of action upon the policy of the French\r\ngovernment is a matter of speculation, as to which the present writer\r\nhas no doubts; but no English officer in chief command rose to the\r\nlevel of the situation, with the exception of Hood, and possibly of\r\nHowe. Rodney was now old, infirm, and though of great ability, a\r\ncareful tactician rather than a great admiral.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Graves and subsequent surrender of Cornwallis did not\r\nend the naval operations in the western hemisphere. On the contrary,\r\none of the most interesting tactical feats and the most brilliant\r\nvictory of the whole war were yet to grace the English flag in the\r\nWest Indies; but with the events at Yorktown the patriotic interest\r\nfor Americans closes. Before quitting that struggle for independence,\r\nit must again be affirmed that its successful ending, at least at so\r\nearly a date, was due to the control of the sea,--to sea power in the\r\nhands of the French, and its improper distribution by the English\r\nauthorities. This assertion may be safely rested on the authority of\r\nthe one man who, above all others, thoroughly knew the resources of\r\nthe country, the temper of the people, the difficulties of the\r\nstruggle, and whose name is still the highest warrant for sound,\r\nquiet, unfluttered good-sense and patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe keynote to all Washington's utterances is set in the \"Memorandum\r\nfor concerting a plan of operations with the French army,\" dated July\r\n15, 1780, and sent by the hands of Lafayette:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Marquis de Lafayette will be pleased to communicate the\r\n    following general ideas to Count de Rochambeau and the Chevalier\r\n    de Ternay, as the sentiments of the underwritten:\r\n\r\n    \"I. _In any operation, and under all circumstances, a decisive\r\n    naval superiority is to be considered as a fundamental\r\n    principle, and the basis upon which every hope of success must\r\n    ultimately depend._\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, though the most formal and decisive expression of\r\nWashington's views, is but one among many others equally distinct.\r\nThus, writing to Franklin, December 20, 1780, he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Disappointed of the second division of French troops [blockaded\r\n    in Brest], but more especially in the expected naval\r\n    superiority, which was the pivot upon which everything turned,\r\n    we have been compelled to spend an inactive campaign after a\r\n    flattering prospect at the opening of it.... Latterly we have\r\n    been obliged to become spectators of a succession of detachments\r\n    from the army at New York in aid of Lord Cornwallis; while our\r\n    naval weakness, and the political dissolution of a large part of\r\n    our army, put it out of our power to counteract them at the\r\n    southward, or to take advantage of them here.\"\r\n\r\nA month later, January 15, 1781, in a memorandum letter to Colonel\r\nLaurens, sent on a special mission to France, he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Next to a loan of money, a constant naval superiority upon\r\n    these coasts is the object most interesting. This would\r\n    instantly reduce the enemy to a difficult defensive.... Indeed,\r\n    it is not to be conceived how they could subsist a large force\r\n    in this country, if we had the command of the seas to interrupt\r\n    the regular transmission of supplies from Europe. This\r\n    superiority, with an aid in money, would enable us to convert\r\n    the war into a vigorous offensive. With respect to us it seems\r\n    to be one of two deciding points.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter to the same person, then in Paris, dated April 9, he\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n    \"If France delays a timely and powerful aid in the critical\r\n    posture of our affairs, it will avail us nothing, should she\r\n    attempt it hereafter.... Why need I run into detail, when it may\r\n    be declared in a word that we are at the end of our tether, and\r\n    that now or never our deliverance must come? How easy would it\r\n    be to retort the enemy's own game upon them, if it could be made\r\n    to comport with the general plan of the war to keep a superior\r\n    fleet always in these seas, and France would put us in condition\r\n    to be active by advancing us money.\"\r\n\r\nShips and money are the burden of his cry. May 23, 1781, he writes to\r\nthe Chevalier de la Luzerne: \"I do not see how it is possible to give\r\neffectual support to the Southern States, and avert the evils which\r\nthreaten, while we are inferior in naval force in these seas.\" As the\r\nseason for active operations advances, his utterances are more\r\nfrequent and urgent. To Major General Greene, struggling with his\r\ndifficulties in South Carolina, he writes, June 1, 1781: \"Our affairs\r\nhave been attentively considered in every point of view, and it was\r\nfinally determined to make an attempt upon New York, in preference to\r\na Southern operation, as we had not decided command of the water.\" To\r\nJefferson, June 8: \"Should I be supported in the manner I expect, by\r\nthe neighboring States, the enemy will, I hope, be reduced to the\r\nnecessity of recalling part of their force from the southward to\r\nsupport New York, or they will run the most imminent risk of being\r\nexpelled from that post, which is to them invaluable; and should we,\r\nby a lucky coincidence of circumstances, gain a naval superiority,\r\ntheir ruin would be inevitable.... While we remain inferior at sea ...\r\npolicy dictates that relief should be attempted by diversion rather\r\nthan by sending reinforcements immediately to the point in distress,\"\r\nthat is, to the South. To Rochambeau, June 13: \"Your Excellency will\r\nrecollect that New York was looked upon by us as the only practicable\r\nobject under present circumstances; but should we be able to secure a\r\nnaval superiority, we may perhaps find others more practicable and\r\nequally advisable.\" By the 15th of August the letters of De Grasse\r\nannouncing his sailing for the Chesapeake were received, and the\r\ncorrespondence of Washington is thenceforth filled with busy\r\npreparations for the campaign in Virginia, based upon the long-delayed\r\nfleet. The discouragement of De Grasse, and his purpose to go to sea,\r\nupon learning that the English fleet in New York had been reinforced,\r\ndrew forth an appealing letter dated September 25, which is too long\r\nfor quotation; but the danger passed, Washington's confidence returns.\r\nThe day after the capitulation he writes to De Grasse: \"The surrender\r\nof York ... _the honor of which belongs to your Excellency_, has\r\ngreatly anticipated [in time] our most sanguine anticipations.\" He\r\nthen goes on to urge further operations in the South, seeing so much\r\nof the good season was still left: \"The general naval superiority of\r\nthe British, previous to your arrival, gave them decisive advantages\r\nin the South, in the rapid transport of their troops and supplies;\r\nwhile the immense land marches of our succors, too tardy and expensive\r\nin every point of view, subjected us to be beaten in detail. It will\r\ndepend upon your Excellency, therefore, to terminate the war.\" De\r\nGrasse refusing this request, but intimating an intention to\r\nco-operate in the next year's campaign, Washington instantly accepts:\r\n\"With your Excellency I need not insist upon the indispensable\r\nnecessity of a maritime force capable of giving you an absolute\r\nascendency in these seas.... You will have observed that, whatever\r\nefforts are made by the land armies, the navy must have the casting\r\nvote in the present contest.\" A fortnight later, November 15, he\r\nwrites to Lafayette, who is on the point of sailing for France:--\r\n\r\n    \"As you expressed a desire to know my sentiments respecting the\r\n    operations of the next campaign, I will, without a tedious\r\n    display of reasoning, declare in one word that it must depend\r\n    absolutely upon the naval force which is employed in these seas,\r\n    and the time of its appearance next year. No land force can act\r\n    decisively unless accompanied by a maritime superiority.... A\r\n    doubt did not exist, nor does it at this moment, in any man's\r\n    mind, of the total extirpation of the British force in the\r\n    Carolinas and Georgia, if Count de Grasse could have extended\r\n    his co-operation two months longer.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, in the opinion of the revered commander-in-chief of the American\r\narmies, was the influence of sea power upon the contest which he\r\ndirected with so much skill and such infinite patience, and which,\r\namidst countless trials and discouragements, he brought to a glorious\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the American cause was reduced to these\r\nstraits, notwithstanding the great and admitted losses of British\r\ncommerce by the cruisers of the allies and by American privateers.\r\nThis fact, and the small results from the general war, dominated as it\r\nwas by the idea of commerce-destroying, show strongly the secondary\r\nand indecisive effect of such a policy upon the great issues of war.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[129] Martin: History of France.\r\n\r\n[130] This delay was due to calms. Howe's Despatch, Gentleman's\r\nMagazine, 1778.\r\n\r\n[131] Most accounts say between Goat Island and Canonicut; but the\r\nposition given seems more probable. The names \"Goat\" and \"Gould\"\r\n(often written \"Gold\") are easily confused. Since writing the above,\r\nthe author has been favored with the sight of a contemporary\r\nmanuscript map obtained in Paris, which shows the anchorage as near\r\nCanonicut and abreast Coaster's Harbor Island; the latter being marked\r\n\"L'Isle d'Or ou Golde Isle.\" The sketch, while accurate in its main\r\ndetails, seems the more authentic from its mistakes being such as a\r\nforeigner, during a hurried and exciting stay of twenty-four hours,\r\nmight readily make.\r\n\r\n[132] \"The arrival of the French fleet upon the coast of America is a\r\ngreat and striking event; but the operations of it have been injured by\r\na number of unforeseen and unfavorable circumstances, which, though\r\nthey ought not to detract from the merit and good intention of our\r\ngreat ally, have nevertheless lessened the importance of its services\r\nin a great degree. The length of the passage, in the first instance,\r\nwas a capital misfortune; for had even one of common length taken\r\nplace, Lord Howe, with the British ships-of-war and all the transports\r\nin the river Delaware, must inevitably have fallen; and Sir Henry\r\nClinton must have had better luck than is commonly dispensed to men of\r\nhis profession under such circumstances, if he and his troops had not\r\nshared at least the fate of Burgoyne. The long passage of Count\r\nd'Estaing was succeeded by an unfavorable discovery at the Hook, which\r\nhurt us in two respects,--first, in a defeat of the enterprise upon New\r\nYork and the shipping and troops at that place, and next in the delay\r\noccasioned in ascertaining the depth of water over the bar which was\r\nessential to their entrance into the harbor of New York. And, moreover,\r\nafter the enterprise upon Rhode Island had been planned and was in the\r\nmoment of execution, that Lord Howe with the British ships should\r\ninterpose merely to create a diversion and draw the French fleet from\r\nthe island was again unlucky, as the Count had not returned on the 17th\r\nto the island, though drawn off from it on the 10th; by which means the\r\nland operations were retarded, and the whole subjected to a miscarriage\r\nin case of the arrival of Byron's squadron.\"--WASHINGTON'S Letter, Aug.\r\n20, 1778.\r\n\r\n[133] See page 426.\r\n\r\n[134] D'Estaing's position at anchor is marked by the anchor in Plate\r\nX.\r\n\r\n[135] Of one of these, the \"Monmouth,\" sixty-four (a'), it is said\r\nthat the officers of the French flag-ship drank to the health of the\r\ncaptain of the \"little black ship.\" Ships' names, like those of\r\nfamilies, often have a marked career. A former \"Monmouth,\" twenty\r\nyears before, had attacked and taken, practically single-handed, the\r\n\"Foudroyant,\" eighty-four, one of the finest ships in the French navy.\r\nShe was then commanded by a Captain Gardiner, who, having commanded\r\nByng's ship in the battle which led to his execution, was moved by his\r\nmortification at the result of that affair to dare such desperate\r\nodds, and thereby lost his life. The same ship, here punished so\r\nseverely off Grenada, will be found in like sturdy fight, under\r\nanother captain, three years later in India.\r\n\r\n[136] The line BC shows the final direction of the French\r\nline-of-battle; the lee ship (o) having tacked and standing to o',\r\nwhile the other ships took position in her wake. Though not expressly\r\nstated, Byron doubtless formed in the same way on a parallel line.\r\nInto this new line the disabled ships (c'), which could scarcely have\r\nmade good the course they were heading, would be easily received.\r\n\r\n[137] Chevalier: Hist. de la Marine Française.\r\n\r\n[138] Guérin: Hist. Maritime.\r\n\r\n[139] Drinkwater, in his history of the siege of Gibraltar, explains\r\nthat the Spanish admiral believed that Rodney would not accompany the\r\nconvoy to the Straits, but had separated from it. He did not detect\r\nhis mistake until too late.\r\n\r\n[140] The place where the battle was fought is shown by the crossed\r\nflags.\r\n\r\n[141] The black ships, in position A, represent the English ships\r\nbearing down upon the French centre and rear. The line v r is the\r\nline-of-battle from van to rear before bearing down. The positions v',\r\nr', are those of the van and rear ships after hauling up on the port\r\ntack, when the French wore.\r\n\r\n[142] In a severe reprimand addressed to Captain Carkett, commanding\r\nthe leading ship of the English line, by Rodney, he says: \"Your leading\r\nin the manner you did, induced others to follow so bad an example; and\r\nthereby, forgetting that the signal for the line was at only two\r\ncables' length distance from each other, the van division was led by\r\nyou to _more than two leagues distance_ from the centre division, which\r\nwas thereby exposed to the greatest strength of the enemy and not\r\nproperly supported\" (Life, vol. i. p. 351). By all rules of tactical\r\ncommon-sense it would seem that the other ships should have taken their\r\ndistance from their next astern, that is, should have closed toward the\r\ncentre. In conversation with Sir Gilbert Blane, who was not in this\r\naction, Rodney stated that the French line extended four leagues in\r\nlength, \"as if De Guichen thought we meant to run away from him\" (Naval\r\nChronicle, vol. xxv. p. 402).\r\n\r\n[143] History of the American Revolution.\r\n\r\n[144] For Rodney's reasons, see his Life, vol. i. pp. 365-376.\r\n\r\n[145] At the eastern end of Long Island.\r\n\r\n[146] The French ascribe this disadvantage to the fact that some of\r\ntheir ships were not coppered.\r\n\r\n[147] That the French government was not satisfied with M.\r\nDestouches's action can be safely inferred from its delay to reward\r\nthe officers of the squadron, which called forth much feeling and very\r\nlively remonstrances. The French asserted that Arbuthnot was hooted in\r\nthe streets of New York and recalled by his government. The latter is\r\na mistake, as he went home by his own request; but the former is\r\nlikely enough.

If space allowed, these opinions\r\ncould be amply strengthened by similar statements of Sir Henry\r\nClinton, the English commander-in-chief.[157] In Europe the results\r\nturned yet more entirely upon the same factor. There the allies had\r\nthree several objectives, at each of which England stood strictly upon\r\nthe defensive. The first of these was England herself, involving, as a\r\npreliminary to an invasion, the destruction of the Channel fleet,--a\r\nproject which, if seriously entertained, can scarcely be said to have\r\nbeen seriously attempted; the second was the reduction of Gibraltar;\r\nthe third, the capture of Minorca. The last alone met with success.\r\nThrice was England threatened by a largely superior fleet, thrice the\r\nthreat fell harmless. Thrice was Gibraltar reduced to straits; thrice\r\nwas it relieved by the address and fortune of English seamen, despite\r\noverpowering odds.\r\n\r\nAfter Keppel's action off Ushant, no general encounter took place\r\nbetween fleets in European seas during the year 1778 and the first\r\nhalf of 1779. Meantime Spain was drawing toward a rupture with England\r\nand an active alliance with France. War was declared by her on the\r\n16th of June, 1779; but as early as April 12, a treaty between the two\r\nBourbon kingdoms, involving active war upon England, had been signed.\r\nBy its terms the invasion of Great Britain or Ireland was to be\r\nundertaken, every effort made to recover for Spain, Minorca,\r\nPensacola, and Mobile, and the two courts bound themselves to grant\r\nneither peace, nor truce, nor suspension of hostilities, until\r\nGibraltar should be restored.[158]\r\n\r\nThe declaration of war was withheld until ready to strike; but the\r\nEnglish government, doubtless, should have been upon its guard in the\r\nstrained relations of the two countries, and prepared to prevent a\r\njunction of the two fleets. As it was, no efficient blockade of Brest\r\nwas established, and twenty-eight French sail-of-the-line went out\r\nunopposed[159] June 3, 1779, under D'Orvilliers, Keppel's opponent of\r\nthe year before. The fleet steered for the coasts of Spain, where it\r\nwas to find the Spanish ships; but it was not till the 22d of July\r\nthat the full contingent joined. Seven precious summer weeks thus\r\nslipped by unimproved, but that was not all the loss; the French had\r\nbeen provisioned for only thirteen weeks, and this truly great armada\r\nof sixty-six ships-of-the-line and fourteen frigates had not more than\r\nforty working-days before it. Sickness, moreover, ravaged the fleet;\r\nand although it was fortunate enough to enter the Channel while the\r\nEnglish were at sea, the latter, numbering little more than half their\r\nenemies, succeeded in passing within them. The flabbiness of\r\ncoalitions increased the weakness due to inefficient preparation; a\r\ngreat and not unnatural panic on the English Channel coast, and the\r\ncapture of one ship-of-the-line, were the sole results of a cruise\r\nextending, for the French, over fifteen weeks.[160] The\r\ndisappointment, due to bad preparation, mainly on the part of Spain,\r\nthough the French ministry utterly failed to meet the pressing wants\r\nof its fleet, fell, of course, upon the innocent Admiral d'Orvilliers.\r\nThat brave and accomplished but unfortunate officer, whose only son, a\r\nlieutenant, had died of the pestilence which scourged the allies,\r\ncould not support the odium. Being of a deeply religious character,\r\nthe refuge which Villeneuve after Trafalgar found in suicide was\r\ndenied him; but he threw up his command and retired into a religious\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe scanty maritime interest of the year 1780, in Europe, centres\r\nround Cadiz and Gibraltar. This fortress was invested by Spain\r\nimmediately upon the outbreak of war, and, while successfully\r\nresisting direct attack, the supply of provisions and ammunition was a\r\nmatter of serious concern to England, and involved both difficulty and\r\ndanger. For this purpose, Rodney sailed on the 29th of December, 1779,\r\nhaving under his command twenty ships-of-the-line with a large convoy\r\nand reinforcements for Gibraltar and Minorca, as well as the West\r\nIndia trade. The latter parted company on the 7th of January, under\r\nthe care of four frigates, and the following morning the fleet fell in\r\nwith and captured a Spanish squadron of seven ships-of-war and sixteen\r\nsupply-ships. Twelve of the latter being laden with provisions were\r\ncarried on to Gibraltar. A week later, at one P.M. of the 16th, a\r\nSpanish fleet of eleven sail-of-the-line was seen in the southeast.\r\nThey held their ground, supposing the approaching vessels to be only\r\nsupply-ships for Gibraltar, without a strong force of men-of-war,--an\r\nunfortunate error from which they did not awake until too late to\r\nescape, owing to the yet more unfortunate oversight of having no\r\nlookout frigates thrown out. When the Spanish admiral, Don Juan de\r\nLangara, recognized his mistake, he attempted to escape; but the\r\nEnglish ships were copper-bottomed, and Rodney making the signal for a\r\ngeneral chase overtook the enemy, cut in between him and his port,\r\nregardless of a blowy night, lee shore, and dangerous shoals, and\r\nsucceeded in capturing the commander-in-chief with six ships-of-the-line.\r\nA seventh was blown up. The weather continuing very tempestuous, one of\r\nthe prizes was wrecked, and one forced into Cadiz; several of the\r\nEnglish ships were also in great danger, but happily escaped, and\r\nwithin a few days the entire force entered Gibraltar Bay. The convoy\r\nfor Minorca was at once despatched, and immediately after the return of\r\nthe ships-of-war guarding it, on the 13th of February, Rodney sailed\r\nfor the West Indies with four ships-of-the-line, sending the rest of\r\nhis force, with the prizes, to England under Admiral Digby.\r\n\r\nThe state of politics and parties in England at this time was such\r\nthat, combined with the unavoidable inferiority of the Channel fleet,\r\nit was difficult to find an admiral willing to accept the chief\r\ncommand. An admirable officer, Barrington, the captor of Sta. Lucia,\r\nrefused the first place, though willing to serve as second, even to a\r\njunior.[161] The allied fleet, to the number of thirty-six\r\nsail-of-the-line, assembled at Cadiz. Their cruises, however, were\r\nconfined to the Portuguese coast; and their only service, a most\r\nimportant one, was the capture of an entire convoy, largely laden with\r\nmilitary stores, for the East and West Indies. The entrance of sixty\r\nEnglish prizes, with nearly three thousand prisoners, into Cadiz, was\r\na source of great rejoicing to Spain. On the 24th of October, De\r\nGuichen, returning from his contest with Rodney, came into the same\r\nport with his West Indian squadron, of nineteen ships-of-the-line; but\r\nthe immense armament thus assembled did nothing. The French ships\r\nreturned to Brest in January, 1781.\r\n\r\nWhile thus unproductive of military results in Europe, the war in 1780\r\ngave rise to an event which cannot wholly be passed over by any\r\nhistory of sea power. This was the Armed Neutrality, at the head of\r\nwhich stood Russia, joined by Sweden and Denmark. The claim of England\r\nto seize enemy's goods in neutral ships bore hard upon neutral powers,\r\nand especially upon those of the Baltic and upon Holland, into whose\r\nhands, and those of the Austrian Netherlands, the war had thrown much\r\nof the European carrying-trade; while the products of the Baltic,\r\nnaval stores and grain, were those which England was particularly\r\ninterested in forbidding to her enemies. The declarations finally put\r\nforth by Russia, and signed by Sweden and Denmark, were four in\r\nnumber:\r\n\r\n1. That neutral vessels had a right, not only to sail to unblockaded\r\nports, but also from port to port of a belligerent nation; in other\r\nwords, to maintain the coasting trade of a belligerent.\r\n\r\n2. That property belonging to the subjects of a power at war should be\r\nsafe on board neutral vessels. This was the principle involved in the\r\nnow familiar maxim, \"Free ships make free goods.\"\r\n\r\n3. That no articles are contraband, except arms, equipments, and\r\nmunitions of war. This ruled out naval stores and provisions unless\r\nbelonging to the government of a belligerent.\r\n\r\n4. That blockades, to be binding, must have an adequate naval force\r\nstationed in close proximity to the blockaded port.\r\n\r\nThe contracting parties being neutral in the present war, but binding\r\nthemselves to support these principles by a combined armed fleet of a\r\nfixed minimum number, the agreement received the name of the Armed\r\nNeutrality. The discussion of the propriety of the various\r\ndeclarations belongs to International law; but it is evident that no\r\ngreat maritime State, situated as England then was, would submit to\r\nthe first and third as a matter of right. Policy only could induce her\r\nto do so. Without meeting the declarations by a direct contradiction,\r\nthe ministry and the king determined to disregard them,--a course\r\nwhich was sustained in principle even by prominent members of the\r\nbitter opposition of that day. The undecided attitude of the United\r\nProvinces, divided as in the days of Louis XIV. between the partisans\r\nof England and France, despite a century of alliance with the former,\r\ndrew the especial attention of Great Britain. They had been asked to\r\njoin the Armed Neutrality; they hesitated, but the majority of the\r\nprovinces favored it. A British officer had already gone so far as to\r\nfire upon a Dutch man-of-war which had resisted the search of\r\nmerchant-ships under its convoy; an act which, whether right or wrong,\r\ntended to incense the Dutch generally against England. It was\r\ndetermined by the latter that if the United Provinces acceded to the\r\ncoalition of neutrals, war should be declared. On the 16th of\r\nDecember, 1780, the English ministry was informed that the\r\nStates-General had resolved to sign the declarations of the Armed\r\nNeutrality without delay. Orders were at once sent out to Rodney to\r\nseize the Dutch West India and South American possessions; similar\r\norders to the East Indies; and the ambassador at the Hague was\r\nrecalled. England declared war four days later. The principal effect,\r\ntherefore, of the Armed Neutrality upon the war was to add the\r\ncolonies and commerce of Holland to the prey of English cruisers. The\r\nadditional enemy was of small account to Great Britain, whose\r\ngeographical position effectually blocked the junction of the Dutch\r\nfleet with those of her other enemies. The possessions of Holland fell\r\neverywhere, except when saved by the French; while a bloody but wholly\r\nuninstructive battle between English and Dutch squadrons in the North\r\nSea, in August, 1781, was the only feat of arms illustrative of the\r\nold Dutch courage and obstinacy.\r\n\r\nThe year 1781, decisive of the question of the independence of the\r\nUnited States, was marked in the European seas by imposing movements\r\nof great fleets followed by puny results. At the end of March De\r\nGrasse sailed from Brest with twenty-six ships-of-the-line. On the\r\n29th he detached five under Suffren to the East Indies, and himself\r\ncontinued on to meet success at Yorktown and disaster in the West\r\nIndies. On the 23d of June De Guichen sailed from Brest with eighteen\r\nships-of-the-line for Cadiz, where he joined thirty Spanish ships.\r\nThis immense armament sailed on the 22d of July for the Mediterranean,\r\nlanded fourteen thousand troops at Minorca, and then moved upon the\r\nEnglish Channel.\r\n\r\nThe English had this year first to provide against the danger to\r\nGibraltar. That beset fortress had had no supplies since Rodney's\r\nvisit, in January of the year before, and was now in sore want, the\r\nprovisions being scanty and bad, the biscuits weevilly, and the meat\r\ntainted. Amid the horrors and uproar of one of the longest and most\r\nexciting sieges of history, the sufferings of the combatants were\r\nintensified by the presence of many peaceful inhabitants, including\r\nthe wives and families of soldiers as well as of officers. A great\r\nfleet of twenty-eight ships-of-the-line sailed from Portsmouth on the\r\n13th of March, convoying three hundred merchant-ships for the East and\r\nWest Indies, besides ninety-seven transports and supply-ships for the\r\nRock. A delay on the Irish coast prevented its falling in with De\r\nGrasse, who had sailed nine days after it. Arriving off Cape St.\r\nVincent, it met no enemy, and looking into Cadiz saw the great Spanish\r\nfleet at anchor. The latter made no move, and the English admiral,\r\nDerby, threw his supplies into Gibraltar on the 12th of April,\r\nundisturbed. At the same time he, like De Grasse, detached to the East\r\nIndies a small squadron, which was destined before long to fall in\r\nwith Suffren. The inaction of the Spanish fleet, considering the\r\neagerness of its government about Gibraltar and its equal if not\r\nsuperior numbers, shows scanty reliance of the Spanish admiral upon\r\nhimself or his command. Derby, having relieved Gibraltar and Minorca,\r\nreturned to the Channel in May.\r\n\r\nUpon the approach of the combined fleet of nearly fifty sail in August\r\nfollowing, Derby fell back upon Torbay and there anchored his fleet,\r\nnumbering thirty ships. De Guichen, who held chief command, and whose\r\ncaution when engaged with Rodney has been before remarked, was in\r\nfavor of fighting; but the almost unanimous opposition of the\r\nSpaniards, backed by some of his own officers, overruled him in a\r\ncouncil of war,[162] and again the great Bourbon coalition fell back,\r\nfoiled by their own discord and the unity of their enemy. Gibraltar\r\nrelieved, England untouched, were the results of these gigantic\r\ngatherings; they can scarcely be called efforts. A mortifying disaster\r\nclosed the year for the allies. De Guichen sailed from Brest with\r\nseventeen sail, protecting a large convoy of merchantmen and ships\r\nwith military supplies. The fleet was pursued by twelve English ships\r\nunder Admiral Kempenfeldt, an officer whose high professional\r\nabilities have not earned the immortality with which poetry has graced\r\nhis tragical death. Falling in with the French one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles west of Ushant, he cut off a part of the convoy, despite his\r\ninferior numbers.[163] A few days later a tempest dispersed the\r\nFrench fleet. Only two ships-of-the-line and five merchantmen out of\r\none hundred and fifty reached the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe year 1782 opened with the loss to the English of Port Mahon, which\r\nsurrendered on the 5th of February, after a siege of six months.--a\r\nsurrender induced by the ravages of scurvy, consequent upon the lack\r\nof vegetables, and confinement in the foul air of bombproofs and\r\ncasemates, under the heavy fire of an enemy. On the last night of the\r\ndefence the call for necessary guards was four hundred and fifteen,\r\nwhile only six hundred and sixty men were fit for duty, thus leaving\r\nno reliefs.\r\n\r\nThe allied fleets assembled this year in Cadiz, to the number of forty\r\nships-of-the-line. It was expected that this force would be increased\r\nby Dutch ships, but a squadron under Lord Howe drove the latter back\r\nto their ports. It does not certainly appear that any active\r\nenterprise was intended against the English coast; but the allies\r\ncruised off the mouth of the Channel and in the Bay of Biscay during\r\nthe summer months. Their presence insured the safe arrival and\r\ndeparture of the homeward and outward bound merchantmen, and likewise\r\nthreatened English commerce; notwithstanding which, Howe, with\r\ntwenty-two ships, not only kept the sea and avoided an engagement, but\r\nalso succeeded in bringing the Jamaica fleet safe into port. The\r\ninjury to trade and to military transportation by sea may be said to\r\nhave been about equal on either side; and the credit for successful\r\nuse of sea power for these most important ends must therefore be given\r\nto the weaker party.\r\n\r\nHaving carried out their orders for the summer cruise, the combined\r\nfleets returned to Cadiz. On the 10th of September they sailed thence\r\nfor Algesiras, on the opposite side of the bay from Gibraltar, to\r\nsupport a grand combined attack by land and sea, which, it was hoped,\r\nwould reduce to submission the key to the Mediterranean. With the\r\nships already there, the total rose to nearly fifty ships-of-the-line.\r\nThe details of the mighty onslaught scarcely belong to our subject,\r\nyet cannot be wholly passed by, without at least such mention as may\r\nrecognize and draw attention to their interest.\r\n\r\nThe three years' siege which was now drawing to its end had been\r\nproductive of many brilliant feats of arms, as well as of less\r\nstriking but more trying proofs of steadfast endurance, on the part of\r\nthe garrison. How long the latter might have held out cannot be said,\r\nseeing the success with which the English sea power defied the efforts\r\nof the allies to cut off the communications of the fortress; but it\r\nwas seemingly certain that the place must be subdued by main force or\r\nnot at all, while the growing exhaustion of the belligerents foretold\r\nthe near end of the war. Accordingly Spain multiplied her efforts of\r\npreparation and military ingenuity; while the report of them and of\r\nthe approaching decisive contest drew to the scene volunteers and men\r\nof eminence from other countries of Europe. Two French Bourbon princes\r\nadded, by their coming, to the theatrical interest with which the\r\napproaching drama was invested. The presence of royalty was needed\r\nadequately to grace the sublime catastrophe; for the sanguine\r\nconfidence of the besiegers had determined a satisfactory _dénouement_\r\nwith all the security of a playwright.\r\n\r\nBesides the works on the isthmus which joins the Rock to the mainland,\r\nwhere three hundred pieces of artillery were now mounted, the chief\r\nreliance of the assailants was upon ten floating batteries elaborately\r\ncontrived to be shot and fire proof, and carrying one hundred and\r\nfifty-four heavy guns. These were to anchor in a close north-and-south\r\nline along the west face of the works, at about nine hundred yards\r\ndistance. They were to be supported by forty gunboats and as many bomb\r\nvessels, besides the efforts of the ships-of-the-line to cover the\r\nattack and distract the garrison. Twelve thousand French troops were\r\nbrought to reinforce the Spaniards in the grand assault, which was to\r\nbe made when the bombardment had sufficiently injured and demoralized\r\nthe defenders. At this time the latter numbered seven thousand, their\r\nland opponents thirty-three thousand men.\r\n\r\nThe final act was opened by the English. At seven o'clock on the\r\nmorning of September 8, 1782, the commanding general, Elliott, began a\r\nsevere and most injurious fire upon the works on the isthmus. Having\r\neffected his purpose, he stopped; but the enemy took up the glove the\r\nnext morning, and for four days successively poured in a fire from the\r\nisthmus alone of six thousand five hundred cannon-balls and one\r\nthousand one hundred bombs every twenty-four hours. So approached the\r\ngreat closing scene of September 13. At seven A.M. of that day the ten\r\nbattering-ships unmoored from the head of the bay and stood down to\r\ntheir station. Between nine and ten they anchored, and the general\r\nfire at once began. The besieged replied with equal fury. The\r\nbattering-ships seem in the main, and for some hours, to have\r\njustified the hopes formed of them; cold shot glanced or failed to get\r\nthrough their sides, while the self-acting apparatus for extinguishing\r\nfires balked the hot shot.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock, however, smoke was seen to issue from the ship of\r\nthe commander-in-chief, and though controlled for some time, the fire\r\ncontinued to gain. The same misfortune befell others; by evening, the\r\nfire of the besieged gained a marked superiority, and by one o'clock\r\nin the morning the greater part of the battering-ships were in flames.\r\nTheir distress was increased by the action of the naval officer\r\ncommanding the English gunboats, who now took post upon the flank of\r\nthe line and raked it effectually,--a service which the Spanish\r\ngunboats should have prevented. In the end, nine of the ten blew up at\r\ntheir anchors, with a loss estimated at fifteen hundred men, four\r\nhundred being saved from the midst of the fire by the English seamen.\r\nThe tenth ship was boarded and burned by the English boats. The hopes\r\nof the assailants perished with the failure of the battering-ships.\r\n\r\nThere remained only the hope of starving out the garrison. To this end\r\nthe allied fleets now gave themselves. It was known that Lord Howe was\r\non his way out with a great fleet, numbering thirty-four\r\nships-of-the-line, besides supply vessels. On the 10th of October a\r\nviolent westerly gale injured the combined ships, driving one ashore\r\nunder the batteries of Gibraltar, where she was surrendered. The next\r\nday Howe's force came in sight, and the transports had a fine chance\r\nto make the anchorage, which, through carelessness, was missed by all\r\nbut four. The rest, with the men-of-war, drove eastward into the\r\nMediterranean. The allies followed on the 13th; but though thus placed\r\nbetween the port and the relieving force, and not encumbered, like the\r\nlatter, with supply-ships, they yet contrived to let the transports,\r\nwith scarcely an exception, slip in and anchor safely. Not only\r\nprovisions and ammunition, but also bodies of troops carried by the\r\nships-of-war, were landed without molestation. On the 19th the English\r\nfleet repassed the straits with an easterly wind, having within a\r\nweek's time fulfilled its mission, and made Gibraltar safe for another\r\nyear. The allied fleet followed, and on the 20th an action took place\r\nat long range, the allies to windward, but not pressing their attack\r\nclose. The number of ships engaged in this magnificent spectacle, the\r\nclosing scene of the great drama in Europe, the after-piece to the\r\nsuccessful defence of Gibraltar, was eighty-three of the\r\nline,--forty-nine allies and thirty-four English. Of the former,\r\nthirty-three only got into action; but as the duller sailers would\r\nhave come up to a general engagement, Lord Howe was probably right in\r\ndeclining, so far as in him lay, a trial which the allies did not too\r\neagerly court.\r\n\r\nSuch were the results of this great contest in the European seas,\r\nmarked on the part of the allies by efforts gigantic in size, but\r\nloose-jointed and flabby in execution. By England, so heavily\r\novermatched in mere numbers, were shown firmness of purpose, high\r\ncourage, and seamanship; but it can scarcely be said that the military\r\nconceptions of her councils, or the cabinet management of her sea\r\nforces, were worthy of the skill and devotion of her seamen. The odds\r\nagainst her were not so great--not nearly so great--as the formidable\r\nlists of guns and ships seemed to show; and while allowance must\r\njustly be made for early hesitations, the passing years of indecision\r\nand inefficiency on the part of the allies should have betrayed to her\r\ntheir weakness. The reluctance of the French to risk their ships, so\r\nplainly shown by D'Estaing, De Grasse, and De Guichen, the\r\nsluggishness and inefficiency of the Spaniards, should have encouraged\r\nEngland to pursue her old policy, to strike at the organized forces of\r\nthe enemy afloat. As a matter of fact, and probably from the\r\nnecessities of the case, the opening of every campaign found the\r\nenemies separated,--the Spaniards in Cadiz, the French in Brest.[164]\r\nTo blockade the latter in full force before they could get out,\r\nEngland should have strained every effort; thus she would have stopped\r\nat its head the main stream of the allied strength, and, by knowing\r\nexactly where this great body was, would have removed that uncertainty\r\nas to its action which fettered her own movements as soon as it had\r\ngained the freedom of the open sea. Before Brest she was interposed\r\nbetween the allies; by her lookouts she would have known the approach\r\nof the Spaniards long before the French could know it; she would have\r\nkept in her hands the power of bringing against each, singly, ships\r\nmore numerous and individually more effective. A wind that was fair to\r\nbring on the Spaniards would have locked their allies in the port. The\r\nmost glaring instances of failure on the part of England to do this\r\nwere when De Grasse was permitted to get out unopposed in March, 1781;\r\nfor an English fleet of superior force had sailed from Portsmouth nine\r\ndays before him, but was delayed by the admiralty on the Irish\r\ncoast;[165] and again at the end of that year, when Kempenfeldt was\r\nsent to intercept De Guichen with an inferior force, while ships\r\nenough to change the odds were kept at home. Several of the ships\r\nwhich were to accompany Rodney to the West Indies were ready when\r\nKempenfeldt sailed, yet they were not associated with an enterprise so\r\nnearly affecting the objects of Rodney's campaign. The two forces\r\nunited would have made an end of De Guichen's seventeen ships and his\r\ninvaluable convoy.\r\n\r\nGibraltar was indeed a heavy weight upon the English operations, but\r\nthe national instinct which clung to it was correct. The fault of the\r\nEnglish policy was in attempting to hold so many other points of land,\r\nwhile neglecting, by rapidity of concentration, to fall upon any of\r\nthe detachments of the allied fleets. The key of the situation was\r\nupon the ocean; a great victory there would have solved all the other\r\npoints in dispute. But it was not possible to win a great victory\r\nwhile trying to maintain a show of force everywhere.[166]\r\n\r\nNorth America was a yet heavier clog, and there undoubtedly the\r\nfeeling of the nation was mistaken; pride, not wisdom, maintained that\r\nstruggle. Whatever the sympathies of individuals and classes in the\r\nallied nations, by their governments American rebellion was valued\r\nonly as a weakening of England's arm. The operations there depended,\r\nas has been shown, upon the control of the sea; and to maintain that,\r\nlarge detachments of English ships were absorbed from the contest with\r\nFrance and Spain. Could a successful war have made America again what\r\nit once was, a warmly attached dependency of Great Britain, a firm\r\nbase for her sea power, it would have been worth much greater\r\nsacrifices; but that had become impossible. But although she had lost,\r\nby her own mistakes, the affection of the colonists, which would have\r\nsupported and secured her hold upon their ports and sea-coast, there\r\nnevertheless remained to the mother-country, in Halifax, Bermuda, and\r\nthe West Indies, enough strong military stations, inferior, as naval\r\nbases, only to those strong ports which are surrounded by a friendly\r\ncountry, great in its resources and population. The abandonment of the\r\ncontest in North America would have strengthened England very much\r\nmore than the allies. As it was, her large naval detachments there\r\nwere always liable to be overpowered by a sudden move of the enemy\r\nfrom the sea, as happened in 1778 and 1781.\r\n\r\nTo the abandonment of America as hopelessly lost, because no military\r\nsubjection could have brought back the old loyalty, should have been\r\nadded the giving up, for the time, all military occupancy which\r\nfettered concentration, while not adding to military strength. Most of\r\nthe Antilles fell under this head, and the ultimate possession of them\r\nwould depend upon the naval campaign. Garrisons could have been spared\r\nfor Barbadoes and Sta. Lucia, for Gibraltar and perhaps for Mahon,\r\nthat could have effectually maintained them until the empire of the\r\nseas was decided; and to them could have been added one or two vital\r\npositions in America, like New York and Charleston, to be held only\r\ntill guarantees were given for such treatment of the loyalists among\r\nthe inhabitants as good faith required England to exact.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stripped herself of every weight, rapid concentration with\r\noffensive purpose should have followed. Sixty ships-of-the-line on the\r\ncoast of Europe, half before Cadiz and half before Brest, with a\r\nreserve at home to replace injured ships, would not have exhausted by\r\na great deal the roll of the English navy; and that such fleets would\r\nnot have had to fight, may not only be said by us, who have the whole\r\nhistory before us, but might have been inferred by those who had\r\nwatched the tactics of D'Estaing and De Guichen, and later on of De\r\nGrasse. Or, had even so much dispersal been thought unadvisable, forty\r\nships before Brest would have left the sea open to the Spanish fleet\r\nto try conclusions with the rest of the English navy when the question\r\nof controlling Gibraltar and Mahon came up for decision. Knowing what\r\nwe do of the efficiency of the two services, there can be little\r\nquestion of the result; and Gibraltar, instead of a weight, would, as\r\noften before and since those days, have been an element of strength to\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion continually recurs. Whatever may be the determining\r\nfactors in strifes between neighboring continental States, when a\r\nquestion arises of control over distant regions, politically\r\nweak,--whether they be crumbling empires, anarchical republics,\r\ncolonies, isolated military posts, or islands below a certain\r\nsize,--it must ultimately be decided by naval power, by the organized\r\nmilitary force afloat, which represents the communications that form\r\nso prominent a feature in all strategy. The magnificent defence of\r\nGibraltar hinged upon this; upon this depended the military results of\r\nthe war in America; upon this the final fate of the West India\r\nIslands; upon this certainly the possession of India. Upon this will\r\ndepend the control of the Central American Isthmus, if that question\r\ntake a military coloring; and though modified by the continental\r\nposition and surroundings of Turkey, the same sea power must be a\r\nweighty factor in shaping the outcome of the Eastern Question in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIf this be true, military wisdom and economy, both of time and money,\r\ndictate bringing matters to an issue as soon as possible upon the\r\nbroad sea, with the certainty that the power which achieves military\r\npreponderance there will win in the end. In the war of the American\r\nRevolution the numerical preponderance was very great against England;\r\nthe actual odds were less, though still against her. Military\r\nconsiderations would have ordered the abandonment of the colonies; but\r\nif the national pride could not stoop to this, the right course was to\r\nblockade the hostile arsenals. If not strong enough to be in superior\r\nforce before both, that of the more powerful nation should have been\r\nclosed. Here was the first fault of the English admiralty; the\r\nstatement of the First Lord as to the available force at the outbreak\r\nof the war was not borne out by facts. The first fleet, under Keppel,\r\nbarely equalled the French; and at the same time Howe's force in\r\nAmerica was inferior to the fleet under D'Estaing. In 1779 and 1781,\r\non the contrary, the English fleet was superior to that of the French\r\nalone; yet the allies joined unopposed, while in the latter year De\r\nGrasse got away to the West Indies, and Suffren to the East. In\r\nKempenfeldt's affair with De Guichen, the admiralty knew that the\r\nFrench convoy was of the utmost importance to the campaign in the West\r\nIndies, yet they sent out their admiral with only twelve ships; while\r\nat that time, besides the reinforcement destined for the West Indies,\r\na number of others were stationed in the Downs, for what Fox justly\r\ncalled \"the paltry purpose\" of distressing the Dutch trade. The\r\nvarious charges made by Fox in the speech quoted from, and which, as\r\nregarded the Franco-Spanish War, were founded mainly on the expediency\r\nof attacking the allies before they got away into the ocean\r\nwilderness, were supported by the high professional opinion of Lord\r\nHowe, who of the Kempenfeldt affair said: \"Not only the fate of the\r\nWest India Islands, but perhaps the whole future fortune of the war,\r\nmight have been decided, almost without a risk, in the Bay of\r\nBiscay.\"[167] Not without a risk, but with strong probabilities of\r\nsuccess, the whole fortune of the war should at the first have been\r\nstaked on a concentration of the English fleet between Brest and\r\nCadiz. No relief for Gibraltar would have been more efficacious; no\r\ndiversion surer for the West India Islands; and the Americans would\r\nhave appealed in vain for the help, scantily given as it was, of the\r\nFrench fleet. For the great results that flowed from the coming of De\r\nGrasse must not obscure the fact that he came on the 31st of August,\r\nand announced from the beginning that he must be in the West Indies\r\nagain by the middle of October. Only a providential combination of\r\ncircumstances prevented a repetition to Washington, in 1781, of the\r\npainful disappointments by D'Estaing and De Guichen in 1778 and 1780.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[157] The curious reader can consult Clinton's letters and notes, in\r\nthe \"Clinton Cornwallis Controversy,\" by B.F. Stevens. London, 1888.\r\n\r\n[158] Bancroft: History of the United States, vol. x. p. 191.\r\n\r\n[159] Although the English thus culpably failed to use their\r\nsuperiority to the French alone, the Channel fleet numbering over\r\nforty of the line, the fear that it might prevent the junction caused\r\nthe Brest fleet to sail in haste and undermanned,--a fact which had an\r\nimportant effect upon the issue of the cruise. (Chevalier, p. 159.)\r\n\r\n[160] The details of the mismanagement of this huge mob of ships are\r\nso numerous as to confuse a narrative, and are therefore thrown into a\r\nfoot-note. The French fleet was hurried to sea four thousand men\r\nshort. The Spaniards were seven weeks in joining. When they met, no\r\ncommon system of signals had been arranged; five fair summer days were\r\nspent in remedying this defect. Not till a week after the junction\r\ncould the fleet sail for England. No steps were taken to supply the\r\nprovisions consumed by the French during the seven weeks. The original\r\norders to D'Orvilliers contemplated a landing at Portsmouth, or the\r\nseizure of the Isle of Wight, for which a large army was assembled on\r\nthe coast of Normandy. Upon reaching the Channel, these orders were\r\nsuddenly changed, and Falmouth indicated as the point of landing. By\r\nthis time, August 16, summer was nearly over; and Falmouth, if taken,\r\nwould offer no shelter to a great fleet. Then an easterly gale drove\r\nthe fleet out of the Channel. By this time the sickness which raged\r\nhad so reduced the crews that many ships could be neither handled nor\r\nfought. Ships companies of eight hundred or a thousand men could\r\nmuster only from three to five hundred. Thus bad administration\r\ncrippled the fighting powers of the fleet; while the unaccountable\r\nmilitary blunder of changing the objective from a safe and accessible\r\nroadstead to a fourth-rate and exposed harbor completed the disaster\r\nby taking away the only hope of a secure base of operations during the\r\nfall and winter months. France then had no first-class port on the\r\nChannel; hence the violent westerly gales which prevail in the autumn\r\nand winter would have driven the allies into the North Sea.\r\n\r\n[161] Life of Admiral Keppel, vol. ii pp. 72, 346, 403. See also\r\nBarrow: Life of Lord Howe, pp. 123-126.\r\n\r\n[162] Beatson gives quite at length (vol. v. p. 395) the debate in the\r\nallied council of war. The customary hesitation of such councils, in\r\nface of the difficulties of the situation, was increased by an appeal\r\nto the delusion of commerce-destroying as a decisive mode of warfare.\r\nM. de Beausset urged that \"the allied fleets should direct their whole\r\nattention to that great and attainable object, the intercepting of the\r\nBritish homeward-bound West India fleets. This was a measure which, as\r\nthey were now masters of the sea, could scarcely fail of success; and\r\nit would prove a blow so fatal to that nation, that she could not\r\nrecover it during the whole course of the war.\" The French account of\r\nLapeyrouse-Bonfils is essentially the same. Chevalier, who is silent\r\nas to details, justly remarks: \"The cruise just made by the allied\r\nfleet was such as to injure the reputation of France and Spain. These\r\ntwo powers had made a great display of force which had produced no\r\nresult.\" The English trade also received little injury. Guichen wrote\r\nhome: \"I have returned from a cruise fatiguing but not glorious.\"\r\n\r\n[163] This mishap of the French was largely due to mismanagement by De\r\nGuichen, a skilful and usually a careful admiral. When Kempenfeldt\r\nfell in with him, all the French ships-of-war were to leeward of their\r\nconvoy, while the English were to windward of it. The former,\r\ntherefore, were unable to interpose in time; and the alternative\r\nremedy, of the convoy running down to leeward of their escort, could\r\nnot be applied by all the merchant-ships in so large a body.\r\n\r\n[164] \"In the spring of 1780 the British admiralty had assembled in\r\nthe Channel ports forty-five ships-of-the-line. The squadron at Brest\r\nwas reduced to twelve or fifteen.... To please Spain, twenty French\r\nships-of-the-line had joined the flag of Admiral Cordova in Cadiz. In\r\nconsequence of these dispositions, the English with their Channel\r\nfleet held in check the forces which we had in Brest and in Cadiz.\r\nEnemy's cruisers traversed freely the space between the Lizard and the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar.\" (Chevalier, p. 202.)\r\n\r\nIn 1781 \"the Cabinet of Versailles called the attention of Holland and\r\nSpain to the necessity of assembling at Brest a fleet strong enough to\r\nimpose upon the ships which Great Britain kept in the Channel. The\r\nDutch remained in the Texel, and the Spaniards did not leave Cadiz.\r\nFrom this state of things it resulted that the English, with forty\r\nships-of-the-line, blocked seventy belonging to the allied powers.\"\r\n(p. 265.)\r\n\r\n[165] \"A question was very much agitated both in and out of\r\nParliament; namely, Whether the intercepting of the French fleet under\r\nthe Count de Grasse should not have been the first object of the\r\nBritish fleet under Vice-Admiral Darby, instead of losing time in\r\ngoing to Ireland, by which that opportunity was missed. The defeat of\r\nthe French fleet would certainly totally have disconcerted the great\r\nplans which the enemies had formed in the East and West Indies. It\r\nwould have insured the safety of the British West India islands; the\r\nCape of Good Hope must have fallen into the hands of Britain; and the\r\ncampaign in North America might have had a very different\r\ntermination.\" (Beatson's Memoirs, vol. v. p. 341, where the contrary\r\narguments are also stated.)\r\n\r\n[166] This is one of the most common and flagrant violations of the\r\nprinciples of war,--stretching a thin line, everywhere inadequate,\r\nover an immense frontier.

It was not till 1781 that the French\r\nCourt felt able to direct upon the East naval forces adequate to the\r\nimportance of the issue. Yet the conditions of the peninsula at that\r\ntime were such as to give an unusual opportunity for shaking the\r\nEnglish power. Hyder Ali, the most skilful and daring of all the\r\nenemies against whom the English had yet fought in India, was then\r\nruling over the kingdom of Mysore, which, from its position in the\r\nsouthern part of the peninsula, threatened both the Carnatic and the\r\nMalabar coast. Hyder, ten years before, had maintained alone a most\r\nsuccessful war against the intruding foreigners, concluding with a\r\npeace upon the terms of a mutual restoration of conquests; and he was\r\nnow angered by the capture of Mahé. On the other hand, a number of\r\nwarlike tribes, known by the name of the Mahrattas, of the same race\r\nand loosely knit together in a kind of feudal system, had become\r\ninvolved in war with the English. The territory occupied by these\r\ntribes, whose chief capital was at Poonah, near Bombay, extended\r\nnorthward from Mysore to the Ganges. With boundaries thus\r\nconterminous, and placed centrally with reference to the three English\r\npresidencies of Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras, Hyder and the Mahrattas\r\nwere in a position of advantage for mutual support and for offensive\r\noperations against the common enemy. At the beginning of the war\r\nbetween England and France, a French agent appeared at Poonah. It was\r\nreported to Warren Hastings, the Governor-General, that the tribes had\r\nagreed to terms and ceded to the French a seaport on the Malabar\r\ncoast. With his usual promptness, Hastings at once determined on war,\r\nand sent a division of the Bengal army across the Jumna and into\r\nBerar. Another body of four thousand English troops also marched from\r\nBombay; but being badly led, was surrounded and forced to surrender in\r\nJanuary, 1779. This unusual reverse quickened the hopes and increased\r\nthe strength of the enemies of the English; and although the material\r\ninjury was soon remedied by substantial successes under able leaders,\r\nthe loss of prestige remained. The anger of Hyder Ali, roused by the\r\ncapture of Mahé, was increased by imprudent thwarting on the part of\r\nthe governor of Madras. Seeing the English entangled with the\r\nMahrattas, and hearing that a French armament was expected on the\r\nCoromandel coast, he quietly prepared for war. In the summer of 1780\r\nswarms of his horsemen descended without warning from the hills, and\r\nappeared near the gates of Madras. In September one body of English\r\ntroops, three thousand strong, was cut to pieces, and another of five\r\nthousand was only saved by a rapid retreat upon Madras, losing its\r\nartillery and trains. Unable to attack Madras, Hyder turned upon the\r\nscattered posts separated from each other and the capital by the open\r\ncountry, which was now wholly in his control.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs when, in January, 1781, a French\r\nsquadron of six ships-of-the-line and three frigates appeared on the\r\ncoast. The English fleet under Sir Edward Hughes had gone to Bombay.\r\nTo the French commodore, Count d'Orves, Hyder appealed for aid in an\r\nattack upon Cuddalore. Deprived of support by sea, and surrounded by\r\nthe myriads of natives, the place must have fallen. D'Orves, however,\r\nrefused, and returned to the Isle of France. At the same time one of\r\nthe most skilful of the English Indian soldiers, Sir Eyre Coote, took\r\nthe field against Hyder. The latter at once raised the siege of the\r\nbeleaguered posts, and after a series of operations extending through\r\nthe spring months, was brought to battle on the 1st of July, 1781. His\r\ntotal defeat restored to the English the open country, saved the\r\nCarnatic, and put an end to the hopes of the partisans of the French\r\nin their late possession of Pondicherry. A great opportunity had been\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a French officer of very different temper from his\r\npredecessors was on his way to the East Indies. It will be remembered\r\nthat when De Grasse sailed from Brest, March 22, 1781, for the West\r\nIndies, there went with his fleet a division of five ships-of-the-line\r\nunder Suffren. The latter separated from the main body on the 29th of\r\nthe month, taking with him a few transports destined for the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, then a Dutch colony. The French government had learned that\r\nan expedition from England was destined to seize this important\r\nhalting-place on the road to India, and Suffren's first mission was to\r\nsecure it. In fact, the squadron under Commodore Johnstone[168] had\r\ngot away first, and had anchored at Porto Praya, in the Cape Verde\r\nIslands, a Portuguese colony, on the 11th of April. It numbered two\r\nships-of-the-line, and three of fifty guns, with frigates and smaller\r\nvessels, besides thirty-five transports, mostly armed. Without\r\napprehension of attack, not because he trusted to the neutrality of\r\nthe port but because he thought his destination secret, the English\r\ncommodore had not anchored with a view to battle.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that at the moment of sailing from Brest one of the\r\nships intended for the West Indies was transferred to Suffren's\r\nsquadron. She consequently had not water enough for the longer voyage,\r\nand this with other reasons determined Suffren also to anchor at\r\nPorto Praya. On the 16th of April, five days after Johnstone, he made\r\nthe island early in the morning and stood for the anchorage, sending a\r\ncoppered ship ahead to reconnoitre. Approaching from the eastward, the\r\nland for some time hid the English squadron; but at quarter before\r\nnine the advance ship, the \"Artésien,\" signalled that enemy's ships\r\nwere anchored in the bay. The latter is open to the southward, and\r\nextends from east to west about a mile and a half; the conditions are\r\nsuch that ships usually lie in the northeast part, near the shore\r\n(Plate XIII).[169] The English were there, stretching irregularly in a\r\nwest-northwest line. Both Suffren and Johnstone were surprised, but\r\nthe latter more so; and the initiative remained with the French\r\nofficer. Few men were fitter, by natural temper and the teaching of\r\nexperience, for the prompt decision required. Of ardent disposition\r\nand inborn military genius, Suffren had learned, in the conduct of\r\nBoscawen toward the squadron of De la Clue,[170] in which he had\r\nserved, not to lay weight upon the power of Portugal to enforce\r\nrespect for her neutrality. He knew that this must be the squadron\r\nmeant for the Cape of Good Hope. The only question for him was whether\r\nto press on to the Cape with the chance of getting there first, or to\r\nattack the English at their anchors, in the hope of so crippling them\r\nas to prevent their further progress. He decided for the latter; and\r\nalthough the ships of his squadron, not sailing equally well, were\r\nscattered, he also determined to stand in at once, rather than lose\r\nthe advantage of a surprise. Making signal to prepare for action at\r\nanchor, he took the lead in his flag-ship, the \"Héros,\" of\r\nseventy-four guns, hauled close round the southeast point of the bay,\r\nand stood for the English flag-ship (f). He was closely followed by\r\nthe \"Hannibal,\" seventy-four (line a b); the advance ship \"Artésien\"\r\n(c), a sixty-four, also stood on with him; but the two rear ships were\r\nstill far astern.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. XIII. PORTO PRAYA. APRIL 16, 1781.]\r\n\r\nThe English commodore got ready for battle as soon as he made out the\r\nenemy, but had no time to rectify his order. Suffren anchored five\r\nhundred feet from the flag-ship's starboard beam (by a singular\r\ncoincidence the English flag-ship was also called \"Hero\"), thus having\r\nenemy's ships on both sides, and opened fire. The \"Hannibal\" anchored\r\nahead of her commodore (b), and so close that the latter had to veer\r\ncable and drop astern (a); but her captain, ignorant of Suffren's\r\nintention to disregard the neutrality of the port, had not obeyed the\r\norder to clear for action, and was wholly unprepared,--his decks\r\nlumbered with water-casks which had been got up to expedite watering,\r\nand the guns not cast loose. He did not add to this fault by any\r\nhesitation, but followed the flag-ship boldly, receiving passively the\r\nfire, to which for a time he was unable to reply. Luffing to the wind,\r\nhe passed to windward of his chief, chose his position with skill, and\r\natoned by his death for his first fault. These two ships were so\r\nplaced as to use both broadsides. The \"Artésien,\" in the smoke,\r\nmistook an East India ship for a man-of-war. Running alongside (c'),\r\nher captain was struck dead at the moment he was about to anchor, and\r\nthe critical moment being lost by the absence of a head, the ship\r\ndrifted out of close action, carrying the East-Indiaman along with her\r\n(c''). The remaining two vessels, coming up late, failed to keep close\r\nenough to the wind, and they too were thrown out of action (d, e).\r\nThen Suffren, finding himself with only two ships to bear the brunt of\r\nthe fight, cut his cable and made sail. The \"Hannibal\" followed his\r\nmovement; but so much injured was she that her fore and main masts\r\nwent over the side,--fortunately not till she was pointed out from the\r\nbay, which she left shorn to a hulk.\r\n\r\nPutting entirely aside questions of international law, the wisdom and\r\nconduct of Suffren's attack, from the military point of view, invite\r\nattention. To judge them properly, we must consider what was the\r\nobject of the mission with which he was charged, and what were the\r\nchief factors in thwarting or forwarding it. His first object was to\r\nprotect the Cape of Good Hope against an English expedition; the\r\nchief reliance for effecting his purpose was to get there first; the\r\nobstacle to his success was the English fleet. To anticipate the\r\narrival of the latter, two courses were open to him,--to run for it in\r\nthe hope of winning the race, or to beat the enemy and so put him out\r\nof the running altogether. So long as his whereabouts was unknown, a\r\nsearch, unless with very probable information, would be a waste of\r\ntime; but when fortune had thrown his enemy across his path, the\r\ngenius of Suffren at once jumped to the conclusion that the control of\r\nthe sea in southern waters would determine the question, and should be\r\nsettled at once. To use his own strong expression, \"The destruction of\r\nthe English squadron would _cut off the root_ of all the plans and\r\nprojects of that expedition, gain us for a long time the superiority\r\nin India, a superiority whence might result a glorious peace, and\r\nhinder the English from reaching the Cape before me,--an object which\r\nhas been fulfilled and was the principal aim of my mission.\" He was\r\nill-informed as to the English force, believing it greater than it\r\nwas; but he had it at disadvantage and surprised. The prompt decision\r\nto fight, therefore, was right, and it is the most pronounced merit of\r\nSuffren in this affair, that he postponed for the moment--dismissed,\r\nso to speak, from his mind--the ulterior projects of the cruise; but\r\nin so doing he departed from the traditions of the French navy and the\r\nusual policy of his government. It cannot be imputed to him as a fault\r\nthat he did not receive from his captains the support he was fairly\r\nentitled to expect. The accidents and negligence which led to their\r\nfailure have been mentioned; but having his three best ships in hand,\r\nthere can be little doubt he was right in profiting by the surprise,\r\nand trusting that the two in reserve would come up in time.\r\n\r\nThe position taken by his own ship and by the \"Hannibal,\" enabling\r\nthem to use both broadsides,--in other words, to develop their utmost\r\nforce,--was excellently judged. He thus availed himself to the full of\r\nthe advantage given by the surprise and by the lack of order in the\r\nenemy's squadron. This lack of order, according to English accounts,\r\nthrew out of action two of their fifty-gun ships,--a circumstance\r\nwhich, while discreditable to Johnstone, confirmed Suffren's judgment\r\nin precipitating his attack. Had he received the aid upon which, after\r\nall deductions, he was justified in counting, he would have destroyed\r\nthe English squadron; as it was, he saved the Cape Colony at Porto\r\nPraya. It is not surprising, therefore, that the French Court,\r\nnotwithstanding its traditional sea policy and the diplomatic\r\nembarrassment caused by the violation of Portuguese neutrality, should\r\nhave heartily and generously acknowledged a vigor of action to which\r\nit was unused in its admirals.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Suffren, who had watched the cautious movements\r\nof D'Estaing in America, and had served in the Seven Years' War,\r\nattributed in part the reverses suffered by the French at sea to the\r\nintroduction of Tactics, which he stigmatized as the veil of timidity;\r\nbut that the results of the fight at Porto Praya, necessarily engaged\r\nwithout previous arrangement, convinced him that system and method had\r\ntheir use.[171] Certainly his tactical combinations afterward were of\r\na high order, especially in his earlier actions in the East (for he\r\nseems again to have abandoned them in the later fights under the\r\ndisappointment caused by his captains' disaffection or blundering).\r\nBut his great and transcendent merit lay in the clearness with which\r\nhe recognized in the English fleets, the exponent of the British sea\r\npower, the proper enemy of the French fleet, to be attacked first and\r\nalways when with any show of equality. Far from blind to the\r\nimportance of those ulterior objects to which the action of the French\r\nnavy was so constantly subordinated, he yet saw plainly that the way\r\nto assure those objects was not by economizing his own ships, but by\r\ndestroying those of the enemy. Attack, not defence, was the road to\r\nsea power in his eyes; and sea power meant control of the issues upon\r\nthe land, at least in regions distant from Europe. This view out of\r\nthe English policy he had the courage to take, after forty years of\r\nservice in a navy sacrificed to the opposite system; but he brought to\r\nits practical application a method not to be found in any English\r\nadmiral of the day, except perhaps Rodney, and a fire superior to the\r\nlatter. Yet the course thus followed was no mere inspiration of the\r\nmoment; it was the result of clear views previously held and\r\nexpressed. However informed by natural ardor, it had the tenacity of\r\nan intellectual conviction. Thus he wrote to D'Estaing, after the\r\nfailure to destroy Barrington's squadron at Sta. Lucia, remonstrating\r\nupon the half-manned condition of his own and other ships, from which\r\nmen had been landed to attack the English troops:--\r\n\r\n    \"Notwithstanding the small results of the two cannonades of the\r\n    15th of December [directed against Barrington's squadron], and\r\n    the unhappy check our land forces have undergone, we may yet\r\n    hope for success. But the only means to have it is to attack\r\n    vigorously the squadron, which, with our superiority, cannot\r\n    resist, notwithstanding its land batteries, whose effects will\r\n    be neutralized if we run them aboard, or anchor upon their\r\n    buoys. If we delay, they may escape.... Besides, our fleet being\r\n    unmanned, it is in condition neither to sail nor to fight. What\r\n    would happen if Admiral Byron's fleet should arrive? What would\r\n    become of ships having neither crews nor admiral? Their defeat\r\n    would cause the loss of the army and the colony. Let us destroy\r\n    that squadron; their army, lacking everything and in a bad\r\n    country, would soon be obliged to surrender. Then let Byron\r\n    come, we shall be pleased to see him. I think it is not\r\n    necessary to point out that for this attack we need men and\r\n    plans well concerted with those who are to execute them.\"\r\n\r\nEqually did he condemn the failure of D'Estaing to capture the four\r\ncrippled ships of Byron's squadron, after the action off Grenada.\r\n\r\nOwing to a combination of misfortunes, the attack at Porto Praya had\r\nnot the decisive result it deserved. Commodore Johnstone got under way\r\nand followed Suffren; but he thought his force was not adequate to\r\nattack in face of the resolute bearing of the French, and feared the\r\nloss of time consequent upon chasing to leeward of his port. He\r\nsucceeded, however, in retaking the East India ship which the\r\n\"Artésien\" had carried out. Suffren continued his course and anchored\r\nat the Cape, in Simon's Bay, on the 21st of June. Johnstone followed\r\nhim a fortnight later; but learning by an advance ship that the French\r\ntroops had been landed, he gave up the enterprise against the colony,\r\nmade a successful commerce-destroying attack upon five Dutch India\r\nships in Saldanha Bay, which poorly repaid the failure of the military\r\nundertaking, and then went back himself to England, after sending the\r\nships-of-the-line on to join Sir Edward Hughes in the East Indies.\r\n\r\nHaving seen the Cape secured, Suffren sailed for the Isle of France,\r\narriving there on the 25th of October, 1781. Count d'Orves, being\r\nsenior, took command of the united squadron. The necessary repairs\r\nwere made, and the fleet sailed for India, December 17. On the 22d of\r\nJanuary, 1782, an English fifty-gun ship, the \"Hannibal,\" was taken.\r\nOn the 9th of February Count d'Orves died, and Suffren became\r\ncommander-in-chief, with the rank of commodore. A few days later the\r\nland was seen to the northward of Madras; but owing to head-winds the\r\ncity was not sighted until February 15. Nine large ships-of-war were\r\nfound anchored in order under the guns of the forts. They were the\r\nfleet of Sir Edward Hughes, not in confusion like that of\r\nJohnstone.[172]\r\n\r\nHere, at the meeting point between these two redoubtable champions,\r\neach curiously representative of the characteristics of his own\r\nrace,--the one of the stubborn tenacity and seamanship of the English,\r\nthe other of the ardor and tactical science of the French, too long\r\nchecked and betrayed by a false system,--is the place to give an\r\naccurate statement of the material forces. The French fleet had three\r\nseventy-fours, seven sixty-fours, and two fifty-gun ships, one of\r\nwhich was the lately captured English \"Hannibal.\" To these Sir Edward\r\nHughes opposed two seventy-fours, one seventy, one sixty-eight, four\r\nsixty-fours, and one fifty-gun ship. The odds, therefore, twelve to\r\nnine, were decidedly against the English; and it is likely that the\r\nadvantage in single-ship power, class for class, was also against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt must be recalled that at the time of his arrival Suffren found no\r\nfriendly port or roadstead, no base of supplies or repair. The French\r\nposts had all fallen by 1779; and his rapid movement, which saved the\r\nCape, did not bring him up in time to prevent the capture of the Dutch\r\nIndian possessions. The invaluable harbor of Trincomalee, in Ceylon,\r\nwas taken just one month before Suffren saw the English fleet at\r\nMadras. But if he thus had everything to gain, Hughes had as much to\r\nlose. To Suffren, at the moment of first meeting, belonged superiority\r\nof numbers and the power of taking the offensive, with all its\r\nadvantages in choice of initiative. Upon Hughes fell the anxiety of\r\nthe defensive, with inferior numbers, many assailable points, and\r\nuncertainty as to the place where the blow would fall.\r\n\r\nIt was still true, though not so absolutely as thirty years before,\r\nthat control in India depended upon control of the sea. The passing\r\nyears had greatly strengthened the grip of England, and\r\nproportionately loosened that of France. Relatively, therefore, the\r\nneed of Suffren to destroy his enemy was greater than that of his\r\npredecessors, D'Aché and others; whereas Hughes could count upon a\r\ngreater strength in the English possessions, and so bore a somewhat\r\nless responsibility than the admirals who went before him.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the sea was still by far the most important factor in\r\nthe coming strife, and for its proper control it was necessary to\r\ndisable more or less completely the enemy's fleet, and to have some\r\nreasonably secure base. For the latter purpose, Trincomalee, though\r\nunhealthy, was by far the best harbor on the east coast; but it had\r\nnot been long enough in the hands of England to be well supplied.\r\nHughes, therefore, inevitably fell back on Madras for repairs after an\r\naction, and was forced to leave Trincomalee to its own resources until\r\nready to take the sea again. Suffren, on the other hand, found all\r\nports alike destitute of naval supplies, while the natural advantages\r\nof Trincomalee made its possession an evident object of importance to\r\nhim; and Hughes so understood it.\r\n\r\nIndependently, therefore, of the tradition of the English navy\r\nimpelling Hughes to attack, the influence of which appears plainly\r\nbetween the lines of his letters, Suffren had, in moving toward\r\nTrincomalee, a threat which was bound to draw his adversary out of his\r\nport. Nor did Trincomalee stand alone; the existing war between Hyder\r\nAli and the English made it imperative for Suffren to seize a port\r\nupon the mainland, at which to land the three thousand troops carried\r\nby the squadron to co-operate on shore against the common enemy, and\r\nfrom which supplies, at least of food, might be had. Everything,\r\ntherefore, concurred to draw Hughes out, and make him seek to cripple\r\nor hinder the French fleet.\r\n\r\nThe method of his action would depend upon his own and his adversary's\r\nskill, and upon the uncertain element of the weather. It was plainly\r\ndesirable for him not to be brought to battle except on his own terms;\r\nin other words, without some advantage of situation to make up for his\r\nweaker force. As a fleet upon the open sea cannot secure any\r\nadvantages of ground, the position favoring the weaker was that to\r\nwindward, giving choice of time and some choice as to method of\r\nattack, the offensive position used defensively, with the intention to\r\nmake an offensive movement if circumstances warrant. The leeward\r\nposition left the weaker no choice but to run, or to accept action on\r\nits adversary's terms.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of Hughes's skill, it must be conceded that\r\nhis task was difficult. Still, it can be clearly thought down to two\r\nrequisites. The first was to get in a blow at the French fleet, so as\r\nto reduce the present inequality; the second, to keep Suffren from\r\ngetting Trincomalee, which depended wholly on the fleet.[173]\r\nSuffren, on the other hand, if he could do Hughes, in an action, more\r\ninjury than he himself received, would be free to turn in any\r\ndirection he chose.\r\n\r\nSuffren having sighted Hughes's fleet at Madras, February 15, anchored\r\nhis own four miles to the northward. Considering the enemy's line,\r\nsupported by the batteries, to be too strong for attack, he again got\r\nunder way at four P.M., and stood south. Hughes also weighed, standing\r\nto the southward all that night under easy sail, and at daylight found\r\nthat the enemy's squadron had separated from the convoy, the ships of\r\nwar being about twelve miles east, while the transports were nine\r\nmiles southwest, from him (Plate XIV. A, A). This dispersal is said to\r\nhave been due to the carelessness of the French frigates, which did\r\nnot keep touch of the English. Hughes at once profited by it, chasing\r\nthe convoy (c), knowing that the line-of-battle ships must follow. His\r\ncopper-bottomed ships came up with and captured six of the enemy, five\r\nof which were English prizes. The sixth carried three hundred troops\r\nwith military stores. Hughes had scored a point.\r\n\r\nSuffren of course followed in a general chase, and by three P.M. four\r\nof his best sailers were two or three miles from the sternmost English\r\nships. Hughes's ships were now much scattered, but not injudiciously\r\nso, for they joined by signal at seven P.M. Both squadrons stood to\r\nthe southeast during the night, under easy sail.\r\n\r\nAt daylight of the 17th--the date of the first of four actions fought\r\nbetween these two chiefs within seven months--the fleets were six or\r\neight miles apart, the French bearing north-northeast from the\r\nEnglish (B, B). The latter formed line-ahead on the port tack (a),\r\nwith difficulty, owing to the light winds and frequent calms. Admiral\r\nHughes explains that he hoped to weather the enemy by this course so\r\nas to engage closely, counting probably on finding himself to windward\r\nwhen the sea-breeze made. The wind continuing light, but with frequent\r\nsqualls, from north-northeast, the French, running before it, kept the\r\npuffs longer and neared the English rapidly, Suffren's intention to\r\nattack the rear being aided by Hughes's course. The latter finding his\r\nrear straggling, bore up to line abreast (b), retreating to gain time\r\nfor the ships to close on the centre. These movements in line abreast\r\ncontinued till twenty minutes before four P.M., when, finding he could\r\nnot escape attack on the enemy's terms, Hughes hauled his wind on the\r\nport tack and awaited it (C). Whether by his own fault or not, he was\r\nnow in the worst possible position, waiting for an attack by a\r\nsuperior force at its pleasure. The rear ship of his line, the\r\n\"Exeter,\" was not closed up; and there appears no reason why she\r\nshould not have been made the van, by forming on the starboard tack,\r\nand thus bringing the other ships up to her.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. XIV. SUFFREN & HUGHES. FEB. 17. 1782.]\r\n\r\nThe method of Suffren's attack (C) is differently stated by him and by\r\nHughes, but the difference is in detail only; the main facts are\r\ncertain. Hughes says the enemy \"steered down on the rear of our line\r\nin an irregular double line-abreast,\" in which formation they\r\ncontinued till the moment of collision, when \"three of the enemy's\r\nships in the first line bore right down upon the 'Exeter,' while four\r\nmore of their second line, headed by the 'Héros,' in which M. de\r\nSuffren had his flag, hauled _along the outside of the first line_\r\ntoward our centre. At five minutes past four the enemy's three ships\r\nbegan their fire upon the 'Exeter,' which was returned by her and her\r\nsecond ahead; the action became general from our rear to our centre,\r\nthe commanding ship of the enemy, with three others of their second\r\nline, leading down on our centre, yet never advancing farther than\r\nopposite to the 'Superbe,' our centre ship, with little or no wind and\r\nsome heavy rain during the engagement. Under these circumstances, the\r\nenemy brought eight of their best ships to the attack of five of ours,\r\nas the van of our line, consisting of the 'Monmouth,' 'Eagle,'\r\n'Burford,' and 'Worcester,' could not be brought into action without\r\ntacking on the enemy,\" for which there was not enough wind.\r\n\r\nHere we will leave them, and give Suffren's account of how he took up\r\nhis position. In his report to the Minister of Marine he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"I should have destroyed the English squadron, less by superior\r\n    numbers than by the advantageous disposition in which I attacked\r\n    it. I attacked the rear ship and stood along the English line as\r\n    far as the sixth. I thus made three of them useless, so that we\r\n    were twelve against six. I began the fight at half-past three in\r\n    the afternoon, taking the lead and making signal to form line as\r\n    best could be done; without that I would not have engaged. At\r\n    four I made signal to three ships to double on the enemy's rear,\r\n    and to the squadron to approach within pistol-shot. This signal,\r\n    though repeated, was not executed. I did not _myself_ give the\r\n    example, in order that I might hold in check the three van\r\n    ships, which by tacking would have doubled on me. However,\r\n    except the 'Brilliant,' which doubled on the rear, no ship was\r\n    as close as mine, nor received as many shots.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal point of difference in the two accounts is, that Suffren\r\nasserts that his flag-ship passed along the whole English line, from\r\nthe rear to the sixth ship; while Hughes says the French divided into\r\ntwo lines, which, upon coming near, steered, one on the rear, the\r\nother on the centre, of his squadron. The latter would be the better\r\nmanoeuvre; for if the leading ship of the attack passed, as Suffren\r\nasserts, along the enemy's line from the rear to the sixth, she should\r\nreceive in succession the first fire of six ships, which ought to\r\ncripple her and confuse her line. Suffren also notes the intention to\r\ndouble on the rear by placing three ships to leeward of it. Two of the\r\nFrench did take this position. Suffren further gives his reason for\r\nnot closing with his own ship, which led; but as those which followed\r\nhim went no nearer, Hughes's attention was not drawn to his action.\r\n\r\nThe French commodore was seriously, and it would seem justly, angered\r\nby the inaction of several of his captains. Of the second in command\r\nhe complained to the minister: \"Being at the head, I could not well\r\nsee what was going on in the rear. I had directed M. de Tromelin to\r\nmake signals to ships which might be near him; he only repeated my own\r\nwithout having them carried out.\" This complaint was wholly justified.\r\nOn the 6th of February, ten days before the fight, he had written to\r\nhis second as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"If we are so fortunate as to be to windward, as the English are\r\n    not more than eight, or at most nine, my intention is to double\r\n    on their rear. Supposing your division to be in the rear, you\r\n    will see by your position what number of ships will overlap the\r\n    enemy's line, and you will make signal to them to double[174]\r\n    [that is, to engage on the lee side].... In any case, I beg you\r\n    to order to your division the manoeuvres which you shall think\r\n    best fitted to assure the success of the action. The capture of\r\n    Trincomalee and that of Negapatam, and perhaps of all Ceylon,\r\n    should make us wish for a general action.\"\r\n\r\nThe last two sentences reveal Suffren's own appreciation of the\r\nmilitary situation in the Indian seas, which demanded, first, the\r\ndisabling of the hostile fleet, next, the capture of certain strategic\r\nports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it\r\nreversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first\r\nand the fleet second as objectives. A general action was the first\r\ndesideratum of Suffren, and it is therefore safe to say that to avoid\r\nsuch action should have been the first object of Hughes. The attempt\r\nof the latter to gain the windward position was consequently correct;\r\nand as in the month of February the sea-breeze at Madras sets in from\r\nthe eastward and southward about eleven A.M., he probably did well to\r\nsteer in that general direction, though the result disappointed him.\r\nDe Guichen in one of his engagements with Rodney shaped the course of\r\nhis fleet with reference to being to windward when the afternoon\r\nbreeze made, and was successful. What use Hughes would have made of\r\nthe advantage of the wind can only be inferred from his own\r\nwords,--that he sought it in order to engage more closely. There is\r\nnot in this the certain promise of any skilful use of a tactical\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nSuffren also illustrates, in his words to Tromelin, his conception of\r\nthe duties of a second in command, which may fairly be paralleled with\r\nthat of Nelson in his celebrated order before Trafalgar. In this first\r\naction he led the main attack himself, leaving the direction of what\r\nmay be called the reserve--at any rate, of the second half of the\r\nassault--to his lieutenant, who, unluckily for him, was not a\r\nCollingwood, and utterly failed to support him. It is probable that\r\nSuffren's leading was due not to any particular theory, but to the\r\nfact that his ship was the best sailer in the fleet, and that the\r\nlateness of the hour and lightness of the wind made it necessary to\r\nbring the enemy to action speedily. But here appears a fault on the\r\npart of Suffren. Leading as he did involves, not necessarily but very\r\nnaturally, the idea of example; and holding his own ship outside of\r\nclose range, for excellent tactical reasons, led the captains in his\r\nwake naturally, almost excusably, to keep at the same distance,\r\nnotwithstanding his signals. The conflict between orders and example,\r\nwhich cropped out so singularly at Vicksburg in our civil war, causing\r\nthe misunderstanding and estrangement of two gallant officers, should\r\nnot be permitted to occur. It is the business of a chief to provide\r\nagainst such misapprehensions by most careful previous explanation of\r\nboth the letter and spirit of his plans. Especially is this so at sea,\r\nwhere smoke, slack wind, and intervening rigging make signals hard to\r\nread, though they are almost the only means of communication. This was\r\nNelson's practice; nor was Suffren a stranger to the idea.\r\n\"Dispositions well concerted with those who are to carry them out are\r\nneeded,\" he wrote to D'Estaing, three years before. The excuse which\r\nmay be pleaded for those who followed him, and engaged, cannot avail\r\nfor the rear ships, and especially not for the second in command, who\r\nknew Suffren's plans. He should have compelled the rear ships to take\r\nposition to leeward, leading himself, if necessary. There was wind\r\nenough; for two captains actually engaged to leeward, one of them\r\nwithout orders, acting, through the impulse of his own good will and\r\ncourage, on Nelson's saying, \"No captain can do very wrong who places\r\nhis ship alongside that of an enemy.\" He received the special\r\ncommendation of Suffren, in itself an honor and a reward. Whether the\r\nfailure of so many of his fellows was due to inefficiency, or to a\r\nspirit of faction and disloyalty, is unimportant to the general\r\nmilitary writer, however interesting to French officers jealous for\r\nthe honor of their service. Suffren's complaints, after several\r\ndisappointments, became vehement.\r\n\r\n    \"My heart,\" wrote he, \"is wrung by the most general defection. I\r\n    have just lost the opportunity of destroying the English\r\n    squadron.... All--yes, all--might have got near, since we were\r\n    to windward and ahead, and none did so. Several among them had\r\n    behaved bravely in other combats. I can only attribute this\r\n    horror to the wish to bring the cruise to an end, to ill-will,\r\n    and to ignorance; for I dare not suspect anything worse. The\r\n    result has been terrible. I must tell you, Monseigneur, that\r\n    officers who have been long at the Isle of France are neither\r\n    seamen nor military men. Not seamen, for they have not been at\r\n    sea; and the trading temper, independent and insubordinate, is\r\n    absolutely opposed to the military spirit.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter, written after his fourth battle with Hughes, must be\r\ntaken with allowance. Not only does it appear that Suffren himself,\r\nhurried away on this last occasion by his eagerness, was partly\r\nresponsible for the disorder of his fleet, but there were other\r\ncircumstances, and above all the character of some of the officers\r\nblamed, which made the charge of a general disaffection excessive. On\r\nthe other hand, it remains true that after four general actions, with\r\nsuperior numbers on the part of the French, under a chief of the skill\r\nand ardor of Suffren, the English squadron, to use his own plaintive\r\nexpression, \"still existed;\" not only so, but had not lost a single\r\nship. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that of a French naval\r\nwriter: \"Quantity disappeared before quality.\"[175] It is immaterial\r\nwhether the defect was due to inefficiency or disaffection.\r\n\r\nThe inefficiency which showed itself on the field of battle\r\ndisappeared in the general conduct of the campaign where the qualities\r\nof the chief alone told. The battle of February 17th ended with a\r\nshift of wind to the southeast at six P.M., after two hours action.\r\nThe English were thus brought to windward, and their van ships enabled\r\nto share in the fight. Night falling, Suffren, at half-past six,\r\nhauled his squadron by the wind on the starboard tack, heading\r\nnortheast, while Hughes steered south under easy sail. It is said by\r\nCaptain Chevalier, of the French navy, that Suffren intended to renew\r\nthe fight next day. In that case he should have taken measures to keep\r\nwithin reach. It was too plainly Hughes's policy not to fight without\r\nsome advantage,--to allow the supposition that with one ship, the\r\n\"Exeter,\" lost to him through the concentration of so many enemies\r\nupon her, he would quietly await an attack. This is so plain as to\r\nmake it probable that Suffren saw sufficient reason, in the results to\r\nhis fleet and the misconduct of his officers, not to wish to renew\r\naction at once. The next morning the two fleets were out of sight of\r\neach other. The continuance of the north wind, and the crippled state\r\nof two of his ships, forced Hughes to go to Trincomalee, where the\r\nsheltered harbor allowed them to repair. Suffren, anxious about his\r\ntransports, went to Pondicherry, where he anchored in their company.\r\nIt was his wish then to proceed against Negapatam; but the commander\r\nof the troops chose to act against Cuddalore. After negotiations and\r\narrangements with Hyder Ali the army landed south of Porto Novo, and\r\nmarched against Cuddalore, which surrendered on the 4th of April.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Suffren, anxious to act against his principal objective, had\r\nsailed again on the 23d of March. It was his hope to cut off two\r\nships-of-the-line which were expected from England. For this he was\r\ntoo late; the two seventy-fours joined the main body at Madras, March\r\n30th. Hughes had refitted at Trincomalee in a fortnight, and reached\r\nMadras again on the 12th of March. Soon after the reinforcement had\r\njoined him, he sailed again for Trincomalee with troops and military\r\nstores for the garrison. On the 8th of April Suffren's squadron was\r\nseen to the northeast, also standing to the southward. Hughes kept on,\r\nthrough that and the two following days, with light northerly winds.\r\nOn the 11th he made the coast of Ceylon, fifty miles north of\r\nTrincomalee, and bore away for the port. On the morning of the 12th\r\nthe French squadron in the northeast was seen crowding sail in\r\npursuit. It was the day on which Rodney and De Grasse met in the West\r\nIndies, but the parts were reversed; here the French, not the English,\r\nsought action.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the ships in both squadrons was very unequal; each had\r\nsome coppered ships and some not coppered. Hughes found that his slow\r\nsailers could not escape the fastest of his enemy,--a condition which\r\nwill always compel a retreating force to hazard an action, unless it\r\ncan resolve to give up the rear ships, and which makes it imperative\r\nfor the safety, as well as the efficiency, of a squadron that vessels\r\nof the same class should all have a certain minimum speed. The same\r\ncause--the danger of a separated ship--led the unwilling De Grasse,\r\nthe same day, in another scene, to a risky manoeuvre and a great\r\nmishap. Hughes, with better reason, resolved to fight; and at nine\r\nA.M. formed his line on the starboard tack, standing in-shore (Plate\r\nXV., A), the squadron in good order, with intervals of two cables\r\nbetween the ships.[176] His account, which again varies from that of\r\nSuffren, giving a radically different idea of the tactics used by the\r\nFrench commodore, and more to the credit of the latter's skill, will\r\nfirst be followed. He says:--\r\n\r\n    \"The enemy, bearing north by east, distant six miles, with wind\r\n    at north by east, continued manoeuvring their ships and\r\n    changing their positions in line, till fifteen minutes past\r\n    noon, when they bore away (a) to engage us, five sail of their\r\n    van stretching along (b) to engage the ships of our van, and the\r\n    other seven sail (b') steering directly on our three centre\r\n    ships, the 'Superbe,' the 'Monmouth,' her second ahead, and the\r\n    'Monarca,' her second astern. At half-past one the engagement\r\n    began in the van of both squadrons; three minutes after, I made\r\n    the signal for battle. The French admiral in the 'Héros' and his\r\n    second astern in 'L'Orient' (both seventy-fours) bore down on\r\n    the 'Superbe'[177] within pistol-shot. The 'Héros' continued in\r\n    her position, giving and receiving a severe fire for nine\r\n    minutes, and then stood on, greatly damaged, to attack the\r\n    'Monmouth,' at that time engaged with another of the enemy's\r\n    ships, making room for the ships in his rear to come up to the\r\n    attack of our centre, where the engagement was hottest. At three\r\n    the 'Monmouth' had her mizzen-mast shot away, and in a few\r\n    minutes her mainmast, and bore out of the line to leeward (C,\r\n    c); and at forty minutes past three the wind unexpectedly\r\n    continuing far northerly without any sea-breeze, and being\r\n    careful not to entangle our ships with the land, I made signal\r\n    to wear and haul by the wind in a line-of-battle on the larboard\r\n    tack, still engaging the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nNow here, practically, was concentration with a vengeance. In this,\r\nthe hardest fight between these two hard fighters, the English loss\r\nwas 137 killed and 430 wounded in eleven ships. Of this total, the two\r\ncentre ships, the flag-ship and her next ahead, lost 104 killed and\r\n198 wounded,--fifty-three per cent of the entire loss of the squadron,\r\nof which they formed eighteen per cent. The casualties were very much\r\nheavier, in proportion to the size of the ships, than those of the\r\nleaders of the two columns at Trafalgar.[178] The material injury to\r\nhulls, spars, etc., was yet more serious. The English squadron, by\r\nthis concentration of the enemy upon a small fraction of it, was\r\nentirely crippled. Inferior when the action began, its inferiority\r\nwas yet more decisive by the subtraction of two ships, and Suffren's\r\nfreedom to move was increased.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. XV. SUFFREN & HUGHES. APRIL 12, 1782.]\r\n\r\nBut how far was this concentration intended by Suffren? For this we\r\nmust go to the pages of two French writers,[179] who base their\r\nnarratives upon his own despatches on record in the French Marine\r\nOffice. The practical advantage gained by the French must also be\r\ntested by comparing the lists of casualties, and the injuries received\r\nby their individual ships; for it is evident that if both the\r\nsquadrons received the same total amount of injury, but that with the\r\nEnglish it fell on two ships, so that they could not be ready for\r\naction for a month or more, while with the French the damage was\r\ndivided among the twelve, allowing them to be ready again in a few\r\ndays, the victory tactically and strategically would rest with the\r\nlatter.[180]\r\n\r\nAs regards Suffren's purpose, there is nothing to indicate that he\r\nmeant to make such an attack as Hughes describes. Having twelve ships\r\nto the English eleven, his intention seems to have been to pursue the\r\nusual English practice,--form line parallel to the enemy, bear down\r\ntogether, and engage ship to ship. To this he added one simple\r\ncombination; the twelfth French ship, being unprovided with an\r\nopponent, was to engage the rear English ship on her lee side, placing\r\nher thus between two fires. In truth, a concentration upon the van and\r\ncentre, such as Hughes describes, is tactically inferior to a like\r\neffort upon the centre and rear of a column. This is true of steamers\r\neven, which, though less liable to loss of motive power, must still\r\nturn round to get from van to rear, losing many valuable seconds; but\r\nit is specially true of sailing vessels, and above all in the light,\r\nbaffling airs which are apt to mark the change of monsoon at the\r\nseason when this fight was fought. Nelson emphasized his contempt of\r\nthe Russians of his day by saying he would not hesitate to attack\r\ntheir van, counting upon throwing the whole line in confusion from\r\ntheir want of seamanship; but though entertaining a not much better\r\nopinion of the Spaniards, he threw the weight of attack on the rear of\r\nthe allied fleets at Trafalgar. In dealing with such seamen as the\r\ncaptains of Hughes's fleet, it would have been an error to assail the\r\nvan instead of the rear. Only a dead calm could have kept the latter\r\nout of action.\r\n\r\nSuffren's attack is thus described by Captain Chevalier. After\r\nmentioning Hughes's forming line on the starboard tack, he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"This manoeuvre was imitated by the French, and the two\r\n    squadrons ran on parallel lines, heading about west-northwest\r\n    (A, A). At eleven, our line being well formed, Suffren made\r\n    signal to keep away to west-southwest, by a movement all\r\n    together. Our ships did not keep their bearing upon the\r\n    prescribed line, and the van, composed of the best sailers, came\r\n    first within range of the enemy.[181] At one, the leading ships\r\n    of the English fleet opened fire upon the 'Vengeur' and\r\n    'Artésien' [French van]. These two ships, having luffed[182] to\r\n    return the fire, were at once ordered to keep away again.\r\n    Suffren, who wished for a decisive action, kept his course,\r\n    receiving without reply the shots directed upon his ship by the\r\n    enemy. When at pistol-range of the 'Superbe,' he hauled to the\r\n    wind (B), and the signal to open fire appeared at his mainmast\r\n    head. Admiral Hughes having only eleven ships, the 'Bizarre,'\r\n    according to the dispositions taken by the commander-in-chief,\r\n    was to attack on the quarter the rear ship of the English fleet\r\n    and double on it to leeward. At the moment when the first\r\n    cannon-shots were heard, our worst sailers were not up with\r\n    their stations. Breathing the letter, and not the spirit, of the\r\n    commodore's orders, the captains of these ships luffed at the\r\n    same time as those which preceded them. Hence it resulted that\r\n    the French line formed a curve (B), whose extremities were\r\n    represented in the van by the 'Artésien' and 'Vengeur,' and in\r\n    the rear by the 'Bizarre,' 'Ajax,' and 'Sévère.' In consequence,\r\n    these ships were very far from those which corresponded to them\r\n    in the enemy's line.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident from all this, written by a warm admirer of Suffren, who\r\nhas had full access to the official papers, that the French chief\r\nintended an attack elementary in conception and difficult of\r\nexecution. To keep a fleet on a line of bearing, sailing free,\r\nrequires much drill, especially when the ships have different rates of\r\nspeed, as had Suffren's. The extreme injury suffered by the \"Superbe\"\r\nand \"Monmouth,\" undeniably due to a concentration, cannot be\r\nattributed to Suffren's dispositions. \"The injuries which the 'Héros'\r\nreceived at the beginning of the action did not allow her to remain by\r\nthe 'Superbe.' Not being able to back her topsails in time, the braces\r\nhaving been cut, she passed ahead, and was only stopped on the beam of\r\nthe 'Monmouth.'\"[183] This accounts for the suffering of the latter\r\nship, already injured, and now contending with a much larger opponent.\r\nThe \"Superbe\" was freed from Suffren only to be engaged by the next\r\nFrenchman, an equally heavy ship; and when the \"Monmouth\" drifted or\r\nbore up, to leeward, the French flag-ship also drifted so that for a\r\nfew moments she fired her stern guns into the \"Superbe's\" bow (C, d).\r\nThe latter at the same time was engaged on the beam and quarter by two\r\nFrench ships, who, either with or without signal, came up to shield\r\ntheir commodore.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the list of casualties shows that the loss of the\r\nFrench was much more distributed among their ships than was the case\r\nwith the English. No less than three of the latter escaped without a\r\nman killed, while of the French only one. The kernel of the action\r\nseems to have been in the somewhat fortuitous concentration of two\r\nFrench seventy-fours and one sixty-four on an English seventy-four and\r\nsixty-four. Assuming the ships to have been actually of the same force\r\nas their rates, the French brought, counting broadside only, one\r\nhundred and six guns against sixty-nine.\r\n\r\nSome unfavorable criticism was excited by the management of Admiral\r\nHughes during the three days preceding the fight, because he refrained\r\nfrom attacking the French, although they were for much of the time to\r\nleeward with only one ship more than the English, and much separated\r\nat that. It was thought that he had the opportunity of beating them in\r\ndetail.[184] The accounts accessible are too meagre to permit an\r\naccurate judgment upon this opinion, which probably reflected the\r\nmess-table and quarter-deck talk of the subordinate officers of the\r\nfleet. Hughes's own report of the position of the two fleets is vague,\r\nand in one important particular directly contradictory to the French.\r\nIf the alleged opportunity offered, the English admiral in declining\r\nto use it adhered to the resolve, with which he sailed, neither to\r\nseek nor shun the enemy, but to go directly to Trincomalee and land\r\nthe troops and supplies he had on board. In other words, he was\r\ngoverned in his action by the French rather than the English naval\r\npolicy, of subordinating the attack of the enemy's fleet to the\r\nparticular mission in hand. If for this reason he did allow a\r\nfavorable chance of fighting to slip, he certainly had reason bitterly\r\nto regret his neglect, in the results of the battle which followed;\r\nbut in the lack of precise information the most interesting point to\r\nbe noted is the impression made upon public and professional opinion,\r\nindicating how strongly the English held that the attack of the\r\nenemy's fleet was the first duty of an English admiral. It may also be\r\nsaid that he could hardly have fared worse by attacking than he did by\r\nallowing the enemy to become the assailant; and certainly not worse\r\nthan he would have fared had Suffren's captains been as good as his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nAfter the action, towards sunset, both squadrons anchored in fifteen\r\nfathoms of water, irregular soundings, three of the French ships\r\ntaking the bottom on coral patches. Here they lay for a week two miles\r\napart, refitting. Hughes, from the ruined condition of the \"Monmouth,\"\r\nexpected an attack; but when Suffren had finished his repairs on the\r\n19th, he got under way and remained outside for twenty-four hours,\r\ninviting a battle which he would not begin. He realized the condition\r\nof the enemy so keenly as to feel the necessity of justifying his\r\naction to the Minister of Marine, which he did for eight reasons\r\nunnecessary to particularize here. The last was the lack of efficiency\r\nand hearty support on the part of his captains.\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that Suffren erred on the side of excessive caution.\r\nOn the contrary, his most marked defect as a commander-in-chief was an\r\nardor which, when in sight of the enemy, became impatience, and\r\ncarried him at times into action hastily and in disorder. But if, in\r\nthe details and execution of his battles, in his tactical\r\ncombinations, Suffren was at times foiled by his own impetuosity and\r\nthe short-comings of most of his captains, in the general conduct of\r\nthe campaign, in strategy, where the personal qualities of the\r\ncommander-in-chief mainly told, his superiority was manifest, and\r\nachieved brilliant success. Then ardor showed itself in energy,\r\nuntiring and infectious. The eagerness of his hot Provençal blood\r\noverrode difficulty, created resources out of destitution, and made\r\nitself felt through every vessel under his orders. No military lesson\r\nis more instructive nor of more enduring value than the rapidity and\r\ningenuity with which he, without a port or supplies, continually\r\nrefitted his fleet and took the field, while his slower enemy was\r\ndawdling over his repairs.\r\n\r\nThe battle forced the English to remain inactive for six weeks, till\r\nthe \"Monmouth\" was repaired. Unfortunately, Suffren's situation did\r\nnot allow him to assume the offensive at once. He was short of men,\r\nprovisions, and especially of spare spars and rigging. In an official\r\nletter after the action he wrote: \"I have no spare stores to repair\r\nrigging; the squadron lacks at least twelve spare topmasts.\" A convoy\r\nof supply-ships was expected at Point de Galles, which, with the rest\r\nof Ceylon, except Trincomalee, was still Dutch. He therefore anchored\r\nat Batacalo, south of Trincomalee, a position in which he was between\r\nHughes and outward-bound English ships, and was favorably placed to\r\nprotect his own convoys, which joined him there. On the 3d of June he\r\nsailed for Tranquebar, a Danish possession, where he remained two or\r\nthree weeks, harassing the English communications between Madras and\r\nthe fleet at Trincomalee. Leaving there, he sailed for Cuddalore, to\r\ncommunicate with the commander of the land forces and Hyder Ali. The\r\nlatter was found to be much discontented with the scanty co-operation\r\nof the French general. Suffren, however, had won his favor, and he\r\nexpressed a wish to see him on his return from the expedition then in\r\ncontemplation; for, true to his accurate instinct, the commodore was\r\nbent upon again seeking out the English fleet, _after_ beating which\r\nhe intended to attack Negapatam. There was not in him any narrowness\r\nof professional prejudice; he kept always in view the necessity, both\r\npolitical and strategic, of nursing the alliance with the Sultan and\r\nestablishing control upon the seaboard and in the interior; but he\r\nclearly recognized that the first step thereto was the control of the\r\nsea, by disabling the English fleet. The tenacity and vigor with which\r\nhe followed this aim, amid great obstacles, joined to the\r\nclear-sightedness with which he saw it, are the distinguishing merits\r\nof Suffren amid the crowd of French fleet-commanders,--his equals in\r\ncourage, but trammelled by the bonds of a false tradition and the\r\nperception of a false objective.\r\n\r\nHughes meantime, having rigged jury-masts to the \"Monmouth,\" had gone\r\nto Trincomalee, where his squadron refitted and the sick were landed\r\nfor treatment; but it is evident, as has before been mentioned, that\r\nthe English had not held the port long enough to make an arsenal or\r\nsupply port, for he says, \"I will be able to remast the 'Monmouth'\r\nfrom the spare stores on board the several ships.\" His resources were\r\nnevertheless superior to those of his adversary. During the time that\r\nSuffren was at Tranquebar, worrying the English communications between\r\nMadras and Trincomalee, Hughes still stayed quietly in the latter\r\nport, sailing for Negapatam on the 23d of June, the day after Suffren\r\nreached Cuddalore. The two squadrons had thus again approached each\r\nother, and Suffren hastened his preparations for attack as soon as he\r\nheard that his enemy was where he could get at him. Hughes awaited his\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nBefore sailing, however, Suffren took occasion to say in writing home:\r\n\"Since my arrival in Ceylon, partly by the help of the Dutch, partly\r\nthrough the prizes we have taken, the squadron has been equipped for\r\nsix months' service, and I have rations of wheat and rice assured for\r\nmore than a year.\" This achievement was indeed a just source of pride\r\nand self-congratulation. Without a port, and destitute of resources,\r\nthe French commodore had lived off the enemy; the store ships and\r\ncommerce of the latter had supplied his wants. To his fertility of\r\nresource and the activity of his cruisers, inspired by himself, this\r\nresult was due. Yet he had but two frigates, the class of vessel upon\r\nwhich an admiral must mainly depend for this predatory warfare. On the\r\n23d of March, both provisions and stores had been nearly exhausted.\r\nSix thousand dollars in money, and the provisions in the convoy, were\r\nthen his sole resources. Since then he had fought a severe action,\r\nmost expensive in rigging and men, as well as in ammunition. After\r\nthat fight of April 12 he had left only powder and shot enough for one\r\nother battle of equal severity. Three months later he was able to\r\nreport as above, that he could keep the sea on his station for six\r\nmonths without further supplies. This result was due wholly to\r\nhimself,--to his self-reliance, and what may without exaggeration be\r\ncalled his greatness of soul. It was not expected at Paris; on the\r\ncontrary, it was expected there that the squadron would return to the\r\nIsle of France to refit. It was not thought possible that it could\r\nremain on a hostile coast, so far from its nearest base, and be kept\r\nin efficient condition. Suffren thought otherwise; he considered, with\r\ntrue military insight and a proper sense of the value of his own\r\nprofession, that the success of the operations in India depended upon\r\nthe control of the sea, and therefore upon the uninterrupted presence\r\nof his squadron. He did not shrink from attempting that which had\r\nalways been thought impossible. This firmness of spirit, bearing the\r\nstamp of genius, must, to be justly appreciated, be considered with\r\nreference to the circumstances of his own time, and of the preceding\r\ngenerations in which he grew up.\r\n\r\nSuffren was born July 17, 1729, and served during the wars of 1739 and\r\n1756. He was first under fire at Matthews's action off Toulon,\r\nFebruary 22, 1744. He was the contemporary of D'Estaing, De Guichen,\r\nand De Grasse, before the days of the French Revolution, when the\r\nuprising of a people had taught men how often impossibilities are not\r\nimpossible; before Napoleon and Nelson had made a mock of the word.\r\nHis attitude and action had therefore at the time the additional merit\r\nof originality, but his lofty temper was capable of yet higher proof.\r\nConvinced of the necessity of keeping the squadron on its station, he\r\nventured to disregard not only the murmurs of his officers but the\r\nexpress orders of the Court. When he reached Batacalo, he found\r\ndespatches directing him to return to the Isle of France. Instead of\r\ntaking them as a release from the great burden of responsibility, he\r\ndisobeyed, giving his reasons, and asserting that he on the spot could\r\njudge better than a minister in Europe what the circumstances\r\ndemanded. Such a leader deserved better subordinates, and a better\r\ncolleague than he had in the commander of the forces on shore. Whether\r\nor no the conditions of the general maritime struggle would have\r\npermitted the overthrow of the English East Indian power may be\r\ndoubtful; but it is certain that among all the admirals of the three\r\nnations there was none so fitted to accomplish that result as Suffren.\r\nWe shall find him enduring severer tests, and always equal to them.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the 5th of July Suffren's squadron came in sight\r\nof the English, anchored off Cuddalore. An hour later, a sudden squall\r\ncarried away the main and mizzen topmasts of one of the French ships.\r\nAdmiral Hughes got under way, and the two fleets manoeuvred during the\r\nnight. The following day the wind favored the English, and the\r\nopponents found themselves in line of battle on the starboard tack,\r\nheading south-southeast, with the wind at southwest. The disabled\r\nFrench ship having by unpardonable inactivity failed to repair her\r\ninjuries, the numbers about to engage were equal,--eleven on each\r\nside. At eleven A.M. the English bore down together and engaged ship\r\nagainst ship; but as was usual under those conditions, the rear ships\r\ndid not come to as close action as those ahead of them (Plate XVI.,\r\nPosition I.). Captain Chevalier carefully points out that their\r\nfailure was a fair offset to the failure of the French rear on the\r\n12th of April,[185] but fails to note in this connection that the\r\nFrench van, both on that occasion and again on the 3d of September,\r\nbungled as well as the rear. There can remain little doubt, in the\r\nmind of the careful reader, that most of the French captains were\r\ninferior, as seamen, to their opponents. During this part of the\r\nengagement the fourth ship in the French order, the \"Brilliant\" (a),\r\nlost her mainmast, bore up out of the line (a'), and dropped gradually\r\nastern and to leeward (a'')\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. XVI. SUFFREN & HUGHES. JULY 6, 1782.]\r\n\r\nAt one P.M., when the action was hottest, the wind suddenly shifted to\r\nsouth-southeast, taking the ships on the port bow (Position II.). Four\r\nEnglish ships, the \"Burford,\" \"Sultan\" (s), \"Worcester,\" and \"Eagle,\"\r\nseeing the breeze coming, kept off to port, toward the French line;\r\nthe others were taken aback and paid off to starboard. The French\r\nships, on the other hand, with two exceptions, the \"Brilliant\" (a) and\r\n\"Sévère\" (b), paid off from the English. The effect of the change of\r\nwind was therefore to separate the main parts of the two squadrons,\r\nbut to bring together between the lines four English and two French\r\nships. Technical order was destroyed. The \"Brilliant,\" having dropped\r\nfar astern of her position, came under the fire of two of the English\r\nrear, the \"Worcester\" and the \"Eagle,\" who had kept off in time and so\r\nneared the French. Suffren in person came to her assistance (Position\r\nIII., a) and drove off the English, who were also threatened by the\r\napproach of two other French ships that had worn to the westward in\r\nobedience to signal. While this partial action was taking place, the\r\nother endangered French ship, the \"Sévère\" (b), was engaged by the\r\nEnglish \"Sultan\" (s), and, if the French captain M. de Cillart can be\r\nbelieved, by two other English ships. It is probable, from her place\r\nin the line, that the \"Burford\" also assailed her. However this may\r\nbe, the \"Sévère\" hauled down her flag; but while the \"Sultan\" was\r\nwearing away from her, she resumed her fire, raking the English ship.\r\nThe order to surrender, given by the French captain and carried into\r\nexecution by the formal well-established token of submission, was\r\ndisregarded by his subordinates, who fired upon their enemy while the\r\nflag was down. In effect, the action of the French ship amounted to\r\nusing an infamous _ruse de guerre_; but it would be unjust to say that\r\nthis was intended. The positions of the different vessels were such\r\nthat the \"Sultan\" could not have secured her prize; other French ships\r\nwere approaching and must have retaken it. The indignation of the\r\nFrench juniors at the weakness of their captain was therefore\r\njustified; their refusal to be bound by it may be excused to men face\r\nto face with an unexpected question of propriety, in the heat of\r\nbattle and under the sting of shame. Nevertheless, scrupulous good\r\nfaith would seem to demand that their deliverance should be awaited\r\nfrom other hands, not bound by the action of their commander; or at\r\nleast that the forbearing assailant should not have suffered from\r\nthem. The captain, suspended and sent home by Suffren, and cashiered\r\nby the king, utterly condemned himself by his attempted defence: \"When\r\nCaptain de Cillart saw the French squadron drawing off,--for all the\r\nships except the 'Brilliant' had fallen off on the other tack,--he\r\nthought it useless to prolong his defence, and had the flag hauled\r\ndown. _The ships engaged with him immediately ceased their fire_, and\r\nthe one on the starboard side moved away. At this moment the 'Sévère'\r\nfell off to starboard and her sails filled; Captain de Cillart then\r\nordered the fire to be resumed by his lower-deck guns, the only ones\r\nstill manned, and he rejoined his squadron.\"[186]\r\n\r\nThis action was the only one of the five fought by Suffren on the\r\ncoast of India, in which the English admiral was the assailant. There\r\ncan be found in it no indication of military conceptions, of tactical\r\ncombinations; but on the other hand Hughes is continually showing the\r\naptitudes, habits of thought, and foresight of the skilful seaman, as\r\nwell as a courage beyond all proof. He was in truth an admirable\r\nrepresentative of the average English naval officer of the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century; and while it is impossible not to condemn the\r\ngeneral ignorance of the most important part of the profession, it is\r\nyet useful to remark how far thorough mastery of its other details,\r\nand dogged determination not to yield, made up for so signal a defect.\r\nAs the Roman legions often redeemed the blunders of their generals, so\r\ndid English captains and seamen often save that which had been lost by\r\nthe errors of their admirals,--errors which neither captain nor seamen\r\nrecognized, nor would probably have admitted. Nowhere were these solid\r\nqualities so clearly shown as in Suffren's battles, because nowhere\r\nelse were such demands made upon them. No more magnificent instances\r\nof desperate yet useful resistance to overwhelming odds are to be\r\nfound in naval annals, than that of the \"Monmouth\" on April 12, and of\r\nthe \"Exeter\" on February 17. An incident told of the latter ship is\r\nworth quoting. \"At the heel of the action, when the 'Exeter' was\r\nalready in the state of a wreck, the master came to Commodore King to\r\nask him what he should do with the ship, as two of the enemy were\r\nagain bearing down upon her. He laconically answered, 'there is\r\nnothing to be done but to fight her till she sinks.'\"[187] She was\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nSuffren, on the contrary, was by this time incensed beyond endurance\r\nby the misbehavior of his captains. Cillart was sent home; but besides\r\nhim two others, both of them men of influential connections, and one a\r\nrelative of Suffren himself, were dispossessed of their commands.\r\nHowever necessary and proper this step, few but Suffren would have had\r\nthe resolution to take it; for, so far as he then knew, he was only a\r\ncaptain in rank, and it was not permitted even to admirals to deal\r\nthus with their juniors. \"You may perhaps be angry, Monseigneur,\" he\r\nwrote, \"that I have not used rigor sooner; but I beg you to remember\r\nthat the regulations do not give this power even to a general officer,\r\nwhich I am not.\"\r\n\r\nIt is immediately after the action of the 6th of July that Suffren's\r\nsuperior energy and military capacity begin markedly to influence the\r\nissue between himself and Hughes. The tussle had been severe; but\r\nmilitary qualities began to tell, as they surely must. The losses of\r\nthe two squadrons in men, in the last action, had been as one to three\r\nin favor of the English; on the other hand, the latter had apparently\r\nsuffered more in sails and spars,--in motive power. Both fleets\r\nanchored in the evening, the English off Negapatam, the French to\r\nleeward, off Cuddalore. On the 18th of July Suffren was again ready for\r\nsea; whereas on the same day Hughes had but just decided to go to\r\nMadras to finish his repairs. Suffren was further delayed by the\r\npolitical necessity of an official visit to Hyder Ali, after which he\r\nsailed to Batacalo, arriving there on the 9th of August, to await\r\nreinforcements and supplies from France. On the 21st, these joined him;\r\nand two days later he sailed, now with fourteen ships-of-the-line, for\r\nTrincomalee, anchoring off the town on the 25th. The following night\r\nthe troops were landed, batteries thrown up, and the attack pressed\r\nwith vigor. On the 30th and 31st the two forts which made the defensive\r\nstrength of the place surrendered, and this all-important port passed\r\ninto the hands of the French. Convinced that Hughes would soon appear,\r\nSuffren granted readily all the honors of war demanded by the governor\r\nof the place, contenting himself with the substantial gain. Two days\r\nlater, on the evening of September 2d, the English fleet was sighted by\r\nthe French lookout frigates.\r\n\r\nDuring the six weeks in which Suffren had been so actively and\r\nprofitably employed, the English admiral had remained quietly at\r\nanchor, repairing and refitting. No precise information is available\r\nfor deciding how far this delay was unavoidable; but having in view\r\nthe well-known aptitude of English seamen of that age, it can scarcely\r\nbe doubted that, had Hughes possessed the untiring energy of his great\r\nrival, he could have gained the few days which decided the fate of\r\nTrincomalee, and fought a battle to save the place. In fact, this\r\nconclusion is supported by his own reports, which state that on the\r\n12th of August the ships were nearly fitted; and yet, though\r\napprehending an attack on Trincomalee, he did not sail until the 20th.\r\nThe loss of this harbor forced him to abandon the east coast, which\r\nwas made unsafe by the approach of the northeast monsoon, and\r\nconferred an important strategic advantage upon Suffren, not to speak\r\nof the political effect upon the native rulers in India.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate thoroughly this contrast between the two admirals, it is\r\nnecessary also to note how differently they were situated with regard\r\nto material for repairs. After the action of the 6th, Hughes found at\r\nMadras spars, cordage, stores, provisions, and material. Suffren at\r\nCuddalore found nothing. To put his squadron in good fighting\r\ncondition, nineteen new topmasts were needed, besides lower masts,\r\nyards, rigging, sails, and so on. To take the sea at all, the masts\r\nwere removed from the frigates and smaller vessels, and given to the\r\nships-of-the-line while English prizes were stripped to equip the\r\nfrigates. Ships were sent off to the Straits of Malacca to procure\r\nother spars and timber. Houses were torn down on shore to find lumber\r\nfor repairing the hulls. The difficulties were increased by the\r\ncharacter of the anchorage, an open roadstead with frequent heavy sea,\r\nand by the near presence of the English fleet; but the work was driven\r\non under the eyes of the commander-in-chief, who, like Lord Howe at New\r\nYork, inspired the working parties by his constant appearance among\r\nthem. \"Notwithstanding his prodigious obesity, Suffren displayed the\r\nfiery ardor of youth; he was everywhere where work was going on. Under\r\nhis powerful impulse, the most difficult tasks were done with\r\nincredible rapidity. Nevertheless, his officers represented to\r\nhim the bad state of the fleet, and the need of a port for the\r\nships-of-the-line. 'Until we have taken Trincomalee,' he replied, 'the\r\nopen roadsteads of the Coromandel coast will answer.'\"[188] It was\r\nindeed to this activity on the Coromandel coast that the success at\r\nTrincomalee was due. The weapons with which Suffren fought are\r\nobsolete; but the results wrought by his tenacity and fertility in\r\nresources are among the undying lessons of history.\r\n\r\nWhile the characters of the two chiefs were thus telling upon the\r\nstrife in India, other no less lasting lessons were being afforded by\r\nthe respective governments at home, who did much to restore the\r\nbalance between them. While the English ministry, after the news of\r\nthe battle of Porto Praya, fitted out in November, 1781, a large and\r\ncompact expedition, convoyed by a powerful squadron of six\r\nships-of-the-line, under the command of an active officer, to\r\nreinforce Hughes, the French despatched comparatively scanty succors\r\nin small detached bodies, relying apparently upon secrecy rather than\r\nupon force to assure their safety. Thus Suffren, while struggling with\r\nhis innumerable embarrassments, had the mortification of learning that\r\nnow one and now another of the small detachments sent to his relief\r\nwere captured, or driven back to France, before they were clear of\r\nEuropean waters. There was in truth little safety for small divisions\r\nnorth of the Straits of Gibraltar. Thus the advantages gained by his\r\nactivity were in the end sacrificed. Up to the fall of Trincomalee the\r\nFrench were superior at sea; but in the six months which followed, the\r\nbalance turned the other way, by the arrival of the English\r\nreinforcements under Sir Richard Bickerton.\r\n\r\nWith his usual promptness the French commodore had prepared for\r\nfurther immediate action as soon as Trincomalee surrendered. The\r\ncannon and men landed from the ships were at once re-embarked, and the\r\nport secured by a garrison strong enough to relieve him of any\r\nanxiety about holding it. This great seaman, who had done as much in\r\nproportion to the means intrusted to him as any known to history, and\r\nhad so signally illustrated the sphere and influence of naval power,\r\nhad no intention of fettering the movements of his fleet, or risking\r\nhis important conquest, by needlessly taking upon the shoulders of the\r\nships the burden of defending a seaport. When Hughes appeared, it was\r\npast the power of the English fleet by a single battle to reduce the\r\nnow properly garrisoned post. Doubtless a successful campaign, by\r\ndestroying or driving away the French sea power, would achieve this\r\nresult; but Suffren might well believe that, whatever mishaps might\r\narise on a single day, he could in the long run more than hold his own\r\nwith his opponent.\r\n\r\nSeaports should defend themselves; the sphere of the fleet is on the\r\nopen sea, its object offence rather than defence, its objective the\r\nenemy's shipping wherever it can be found. Suffren now saw again\r\nbefore him the squadron on which depended the English control of the\r\nsea; he knew that powerful reinforcements to it must arrive before the\r\nnext season, and he hastened to attack. Hughes, mortified by his\r\nfailure to arrive in time,--for a drawn battle beforehand would have\r\nsaved what a successful battle afterward could not regain,--was in no\r\nhumor to balk him. Still, with sound judgment, he retreated to the\r\nsoutheast, flying in good order, to use Suffren's expression;\r\nregulating speed by the slowest ships, and steering many different\r\ncourses, so that the chase which began at daybreak overtook the enemy\r\nonly at two in the afternoon. The object of the English was to draw\r\nSuffren so far to leeward of the port that, if his ships were\r\ndisabled, he could not easily regain it.\r\n\r\nThe French numbered fourteen ships-of-the-line to twelve English. This\r\nsuperiority, together with his sound appreciation of the military\r\nsituation in India, increased Suffren's natural eagerness for action;\r\nbut his ships sailed badly, and were poorly handled by indifferent and\r\ndissatisfied men. These circumstances, during the long and vexatious\r\npursuit, chafed and fretted the hot temper of the commodore, which\r\nstill felt the spur of urgency that for two months had quickened the\r\noperations of the squadron. Signal followed signal, manoeuvre\r\nsucceeded manoeuvre, to bring his disordered vessels into position.\r\n\"Sometimes they edged down, sometimes they brought to,\" says the\r\nEnglish admiral, who was carefully watching their approach, \"in no\r\nregular order, as if undetermined what to do.\" Still, Suffren\r\ncontinued on, and at two P.M., having been carried twenty-five miles\r\naway from his port, his line being then partly formed and within\r\nstriking distance of the enemy, the signal was made to come to the\r\nwind to correct the order before finally bearing down. A number of\r\nblunders in executing this made matters worse rather than better; and\r\nthe commodore, at last losing patience, made signal thirty minutes\r\nlater to attack (Plate XVII., A), following it with another for close\r\naction at pistol range. This being slowly and clumsily obeyed, he\r\nordered a gun fired, as is customary at sea to emphasize a signal;\r\nunluckily this was understood by his own crew to be the opening of the\r\naction, and the flag-ship discharged all her battery. This example was\r\nfollowed by the other ships, though yet at the distance of half\r\ncannon-shot, which, under the gunnery conditions of that day, meant\r\nindecisive action. Thus at the end and as the result of a mortifying\r\nseries of blunders and bad seamanship, the battle began greatly to the\r\ndisadvantage of the French, despite their superior numbers. The\r\nEnglish, who had been retreating under short and handy sail, were in\r\ngood order and quietly ready; whereas their enemies were in no order\r\n(B). Seven ships had forereached in rounding to,[189] and now formed\r\nan irregular group ahead of the English van, as well as far from it,\r\nwhere they were of little service; while in the centre a second\r\nconfused group was formed, the ships overlapping and masking each\r\nother's fire. Under the circumstances the entire brunt of the action\r\nfell upon Suffren's flag-ship (a) and two others which supported him;\r\nwhile at the extreme rear a small ship-of-the-line, backed by a large\r\nfrigate, alone engaged the English rear; but these, being wholly\r\novermatched, were soon forced to retire.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. XVII. SUFFREN AND HUGHES SEPT. 3, 1782.]\r\n\r\nA military operation could scarcely be worse carried out. The French\r\nships in the battle did not support each other; they were so grouped\r\nas to hamper their own fire and needlessly increase the target offered\r\nto the enemy; so far from concentrating their own effort, three ships\r\nwere left, almost unsupported, to a concentrated fire from the English\r\nline.[190] \"Time passed on, and our three ships [B, a], engaged on the\r\nbeam by the centre of the English fleet and raked [enfiladed] by van\r\nand rear, suffered greatly. After two hours the 'Héros'' sails were in\r\nrags, all her running rigging cut, and she could no longer steer. The\r\n'Illustre' had lost her mizzen-mast and maintopmast.\" In this disorder\r\nsuch gaps existed as to offer a great opportunity to a more active\r\nopponent. \"Had the enemy tacked now,\" wrote the chief-of-staff in his\r\njournal, \"we would have been cut off and probably destroyed.\" The\r\nfaults of an action in which every proper distribution was wanting are\r\nsummed up in the results. The French had fourteen ships engaged. They\r\nlost eighty-two killed and two hundred and fifty-five wounded. Of this\r\ntotal, sixty-four killed and one hundred and seventy-eight wounded, or\r\nthree fourths, fell to three ships. Two of these three lost their main\r\nand mizzen masts and foretopmast; in other words, were helpless.\r\n\r\nThis was a repetition on a larger scale of the disaster to two of\r\nHughes's ships on the 12th of April; but on that day the English\r\nadmiral, being to leeward and in smaller force had to accept action on\r\nthe adversary's terms, while here the loss fell on the assailant, who,\r\nto the advantage of the wind and choice of his mode of attack, added\r\nsuperiority in numbers. Full credit must in this action be allowed to\r\nHughes, who, though lacking in enterprise and giving no token of\r\ntactical skill or _coup d'oeil_, showed both judgment and good\r\nmanagement in the direction of his retreat and in keeping his ships so\r\nwell in hand. It is not easy to apportion the blame which rests upon\r\nhis enemies. Suffren laid it freely upon his captains.[191] It has\r\nbeen rightly pointed out, however, that many of the officers thus\r\ncondemned in mass had conducted themselves well before, both under\r\nSuffren and other admirals; that the order of pursuit was irregular,\r\nand Suffren's signals followed each other with confusing rapidity; and\r\nfinally that chance, for which something must always be allowed, was\r\nagainst the French, as was also the inexperience of several captains.\r\nIt is pretty certain that some of the mishap must be laid to the fiery\r\nand inconsiderate haste of Suffren, who had the defects of his great\r\nqualities, upon which his coy and wary antagonist unwittingly played.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that no complaints of his captains are to be found in\r\nHughes's reports. Six fell in action, and of each he speaks in terms\r\nof simple but evidently sincere appreciation, while on the survivors\r\nhe often bestows particular as well as general commendation. The\r\nmarked contrast between the two leaders, and between the individual\r\nship-commanders, on either side, makes this singularly instructive\r\namong naval campaigns; and the ultimate lesson taught is in entire\r\naccordance with the experience of all military history from the\r\nbeginning. Suffren had genius, energy, great tenacity, sound military\r\nideas, and was also an accomplished seaman. Hughes had apparently all\r\nthe technical acquirements of the latter profession, would probably\r\nhave commanded a ship equally well with any of his captains, but shows\r\nno trace of the qualities needed by a general officer. On the other\r\nhand, without insisting again upon the skill and fidelity of the\r\nEnglish subordinates, it is evident that, to whatever it be\r\nattributed, the French single ships were as a rule incomparably\r\nworse-handled than those of their opponents. Four times, Suffren\r\nclaims, certainly thrice, the English squadron was saved from\r\noverwhelming disaster by the difference in quality of the under\r\nofficers. Good troops have often made amends for bad generalship; but\r\nin the end the better leader will prevail. This was conspicuously the\r\ncase in the Indian seas in 1782 and 1783. War cut short the strife,\r\nbut not before the issue was clearly indicated.\r\n\r\nThe action of September 3, like that of July 6, was brought to a close\r\nby a shift of wind to the southeast. When it came, the English line\r\nwore, and formed again on the other tack. The French also wore; and\r\ntheir van ships, being now to windward, stood down between their\r\ncrippled ships and the enemy's line (C). Toward sundown Hughes hauled\r\noff to the northward, abandoning the hope of regaining Trincomalee,\r\nbut with the satisfaction of having inflicted this severe retaliation\r\nupon his successful opponent.\r\n\r\nThat firmness of mind which was not the least of Suffren's qualities\r\nwas severely tried soon after the action off Trincomalee. In returning\r\nto port, a seventy-four, the \"Orient,\" was run ashore and lost by\r\nmismanagement, the only consolation being that her spars were saved\r\nfor the two dismasted ships. Other crippled masts were replaced as\r\nbefore by robbing the frigates, whose crews also were needed to\r\nreplace the losses in battle. Repairs were pushed on with the usual\r\nenergy, the defence of the port was fully provided for, and on the\r\n30th of September the squadron sailed for the Coromandel coast, where\r\nthe state of French interests urgently called for it. Cuddalore was\r\nreached in four days; and here another incapable officer wrecked the\r\n\"Bizarre,\" of sixty-four guns, in picking up his anchorage. In\r\nconsequence of the loss of these two ships, Suffren, when he next met\r\nthe enemy, could oppose only fifteen to eighteen ships-of-the-line; so\r\nmuch do general results depend upon individual ability and care.\r\nHughes was at Madras, ninety miles north, whither he had gone at once\r\nafter the late action. He reports his ships badly damaged; but the\r\nloss was so evenly distributed among them that it is difficult to\r\njustify his failure to follow up the injuries done to the French.\r\n\r\nAt this season the monsoon wind, which has come for four or five\r\nmonths from southwest, changes to northeast, blowing upon the east\r\ncoast of the peninsula, where are no good harbors. The consequent\r\nswell made the shore often unapproachable, and so forbade support from\r\nfleet to army. The change of the monsoon is also frequently marked by\r\nviolent hurricanes. The two commanders, therefore, had to quit a\r\nregion where their stay might be dangerous as well as useless. Had\r\nTrincomalee not been lost, Hughes, in the condition of his squadron,\r\nmight have awaited there the reinforcements and supplies expected soon\r\nfrom England; for although the port is not healthy, it is secure and\r\nwell situated. Bickerton had already reached Bombay, and was on his\r\nway now to Madras with five ships-of-the-line. As things were, Hughes\r\nthought necessary to go to Bombay for the season, sailing or rather\r\nbeing driven to sea by a hurricane, on the 17th of October. Four days\r\nlater Bickerton reached Madras, not having fallen in with the admiral.\r\nWith an activity which characterized him he sailed at once, and was\r\nagain in Bombay on the 28th of November. Hughes's ships, scattered and\r\ncrippled by tempest, dropped in one by one, a few days later.\r\n\r\nSuffren held Trincomalee, yet his decision was not easy. The port was\r\nsafe, he had not to fear an attack by the English fleet; and on the\r\nother hand, besides being sickly during the approaching monsoon, it\r\nwas doubtful whether the provisions needed for the health of the crews\r\ncould be had there. In short, though of strategic value from its\r\nstrength and position, the port was deficient in resources. Opposed to\r\nTrincomalee there was an alternative in Achem, a harbor on the other\r\nside of the Bay of Bengal, at the west end of the island of Sumatra.\r\nThis was healthy, could supply provisions, and, from its position with\r\nreference to the northeast monsoon, would permit ships to regain the\r\nCoromandel coast sooner than those in Bombay, when the milder ending\r\nof the season made landing more practicable.\r\n\r\nThese simple considerations were not, however, the only elements in\r\nthe really difficult problem before Suffren. The small results that\r\nfollowed this campaign must not hide the fact that great issues were\r\npossible, and that much might depend upon his decision. Owing to the\r\nFrench policy of sending out reinforcements in several small bodies,\r\nnot only was there much loss, but great uncertainty prevailed among\r\nthe scattered commands as to conditions elsewhere. This uncertainty,\r\nloss, and delay profoundly affected the political situation in India.\r\nWhen Suffren first reached the coast, the English had on their hands\r\nnot only Hyder Ali, but the Mahrattas as well. Peace with the latter\r\nwas signed on the 17th of May, 1782; but, owing probably to an\r\nopposition party among them, the ratifications were not exchanged\r\nuntil December. Both there and in the court of Hyder Ali there was\r\ndivision of interest; and representations were made from both to the\r\nFrench, who, though suspicious, could obtain no certain information of\r\nthe treaty, that everything depended upon the relative military\r\nstrength of themselves and the English. The presence and the actions\r\nof Suffren were all that France had to show,--the prestige of his\r\ngenius, the capture of Trincomalee, his success in battle. The French\r\narmy, cooped up in Cuddalore, was dependent upon the sultan for money,\r\nfor food, and for reinforcements; even the fleet called on him for\r\nmoney, for masts, for ammunition, for grain. The English, on the other\r\nhand, maintained their ground; though on the whole worsted, they lost\r\nno ships; and Bickerton's powerful squadron was known to have reached\r\nBombay. Above all, while the French asked for money, the English\r\nlavished it.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for the French to make head against their enemy\r\nwithout native allies; it was essential to keep Hyder from also making\r\npeace. Here the inadequate support and faulty dispositions of the home\r\ngovernment made themselves felt. The command in India, both by land\r\nand sea, was intrusted to General de Bussy, once the brilliant\r\nfellow-worker with Dupleix, now a gouty invalid of sixty-four. With a\r\nview to secrecy, Bussy sailed from Cadiz in November, 1781, with two\r\nships-of-the-line, for Teneriffe, where he was to be joined by a\r\nconvoy leaving Brest in December. This convoy was captured by the\r\nEnglish, only two of the vessels escaping to Bussy. The latter pursued\r\nhis journey, and learning at the Cape of Good Hope that Bickerton's\r\nstrong force was on the way, felt compelled to land there a great part\r\nof his troops. He reached the Isle of France on the 31st of May. The\r\nnext convoy of eighteen transports, sailing in April for India, was\r\nalso intercepted. Two of the four ships-of-war were taken, as also ten\r\nof the transports; the remainder returned to Brest. A third detachment\r\nwas more fortunate, reaching the Cape in May; but it was delayed there\r\ntwo months by the wretched condition of the ships and crews. These\r\ndisappointments decided Bussy to remain at the Island until joined by\r\nthe expected ships from the Cape, and Suffren at this critical moment\r\ndid not know what the state of things there was. The general had only\r\nwritten him that, as he could not reach the coast before the bad\r\nseason, he should rendezvous at Achem. These uncertainties made a\r\npainful impression upon Hyder Ali, who had been led to expect Bussy in\r\nSeptember, and had instead received news of Bickerton's arrival and\r\nthe defection of his old allies, the Mahrattas. Suffren was forced to\r\npretend a confidence which he did not feel, but which, with the\r\ninfluence of his own character and achievements, determined the sultan\r\nto continue the war. This settled, the squadron sailed for Achem on\r\nthe 15th of October, anchoring there the 2d of November.\r\n\r\nThree weeks afterward a vessel arrived from Bussy, with word that his\r\ndeparture was indefinitely delayed by an epidemic raging among the\r\ntroops. Suffren therefore determined to hasten his own return to the\r\ncoast, and sailed on the 20th of December. January 8, 1783, he\r\nanchored off Ganjam, five hundred miles northeast of Cuddalore, whence\r\nhe would have a fair wind to proceed when he wished. It was his\r\npurpose to attack not only the coasting vessels but the English\r\nfactories on shore as well, the surf being now often moderate; but\r\nlearning on the 12th, from an English prize, the important and\r\ndiscouraging news of Hyder Ali's death, he gave up all minor\r\noperations, and sailed at once for Cuddalore, hoping to secure by his\r\npresence the continuance of the alliance as well as the safety of the\r\ngarrison. He reached the place on the 6th of February.\r\n\r\nDuring his four months absence the failure of Bussy to appear with his\r\ntroops, and the arrival of Bickerton, who had shown himself on both\r\ncoasts, had seriously injured the French cause. The treaty of peace\r\nbetween the English and the Mahrattas had been ratified; and the\r\nformer, released from this war and reinforced, had attacked the sultan\r\non the west, or Malabar, coast. The effect of this diversion was of\r\ncourse felt on the east coast, despite the efforts of the French to\r\nkeep the new sultan there. The sickness among the troops at the Isle\r\nof France had, however, ceased early in November; and had Bussy then\r\nstarted without delay, he and Suffren would now have met in the\r\nCarnatic, with full command of the sea and large odds in their favor\r\nashore. Hughes did not arrive till two months later.\r\n\r\nBeing thus alone, Suffren, after communicating with Tippoo-Saib, the\r\nnew sultan of Mysore, went to Trincomalee; and there he was at last\r\njoined, on the 10th of March, by Bussy, accompanied by three\r\nships-of-the-line and numerous transports. Eager to bring the troops\r\ninto the field, Suffren sailed on the 15th with his fastest ships, and\r\nlanded them the next day at Porto Novo. He returned to Trincomalee on\r\nthe 11th of April, and fell in with Hughes's fleet of seventeen\r\nships-of-the-line off the harbor's mouth. Having only part of his\r\nforce with him, no fight ensued, and the English went on to Madras.\r\nThe southwest monsoon was now blowing.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to follow the trivial operations of the next two\r\nmonths. Tippoo being engaged on the other side of the peninsula and\r\nBussy displaying little vigor, while Hughes was in superior force off\r\nthe coast, the affairs of the French on shore went from bad to worse.\r\nSuffren, having but fifteen ships to eighteen English, was unwilling\r\nto go to leeward of Trincomalee, lest it should fall before he could\r\nreturn to it. Under these conditions the English troops advanced from\r\nMadras, passing near but around Cuddalore, and encamped to the\r\nsouthward of it, by the sea. The supply-ships and light cruisers were\r\nstationed off the shore near the army; while Admiral Hughes, with the\r\nheavy ships, anchored some twenty miles south, where, being to\r\nwindward, he covered the others.\r\n\r\nIn order to assure to Suffren the full credit of his subsequent\r\ncourse, it is necessary to emphasize the fact that Bussy, though\r\ncommander-in-chief both by land and sea, did not venture to order him\r\nto leave Trincomalee and come to his support. Allowing him to feel the\r\nextremity of the danger, he told him not to leave port unless he heard\r\nthat the army was shut up in Cuddalore, and blockaded by the English\r\nsquadron. This letter was received on the 10th of June. Suffren waited\r\nfor no more. The next day he sailed, and forty-eight hours later his\r\nfrigates saw the English fleet. The same day, the 13th, after a sharp\r\naction, the French army was shut up in the town, behind very weak\r\nwalls. Everything now depended on the action of the fleets.\r\n\r\nUpon Suffren's appearance, Hughes moved away and anchored four or five\r\nmiles from the town. Baffling winds prevailed for three days; but the\r\nmonsoon resuming on the 16th, Suffren approached. The English admiral\r\nnot liking to accept action at anchor, and to leeward, in which he was\r\nright, got under way; but attaching more importance to the\r\nweather-gage than to preventing a junction between the enemy's land\r\nand sea forces, he stood out into the offing with a southerly, or\r\nsouth-southeast wind, notwithstanding his superior numbers. Suffren\r\nformed on the same tack, and some manoeuvring ensued during that\r\nnight and the next day. At eight P.M. of the 17th the French squadron,\r\nwhich had refused to be drawn to sea, anchored off Cuddalore and\r\ncommunicated with the commander-in-chief. Twelve hundred of the\r\ngarrison were hastily embarked to fill the numerous vacancies at the\r\nguns of the fleet.\r\n\r\nUntil the 20th the wind, holding unexpectedly at west, denied Hughes\r\nthe advantage which he sought; and finally on that day he decided to\r\naccept action and await the attack. It was made by Suffren with\r\nfifteen ships to eighteen, the fire opening at quarter-past four P.M.\r\nand lasting until half-past six. The loss on both sides was nearly\r\nequal; but the English ships, abandoning both the field of battle and\r\ntheir army, returned to Madras. Suffren anchored before Cuddalore.\r\n\r\nThe embarrassment of the British army was now very great. The\r\nsupply-ships on which it had depended fled before the action of the\r\n20th, and the result of course made it impossible for them to return.\r\nThe sultan's light cavalry harassed their communications by land. On\r\nthe 25th, the general commanding wrote that his \"mind was on the rack\r\nwithout a moment's rest since the departure of the fleet, considering\r\nthe character of M. de Suffren, and the infinite superiority on the\r\npart of the French now that we are left to ourselves.\" From this\r\nanxiety he was relieved by the news of the conclusion of peace, which\r\nreached Cuddalore on the 29th by flag-of-truce from Madras.\r\n\r\nIf any doubt had remained as to the relative merits of the two\r\nsea-commanders, the last few days of their campaign would have removed\r\nthem. Hughes alleges the number of his sick and shortness of water as\r\nhis reasons for abandoning the contest. Suffren's difficulties,\r\nhowever, were as great as his own;[192] and if he had an advantage at\r\nTrincomalee, that only shifts the dispute a step back, for he owed its\r\npossession to superior generalship and activity. The simple facts that\r\nwith fifteen ships he forced eighteen to abandon a blockade, relieved\r\nthe invested army, strengthened his own crews, and fought a decisive\r\naction, make an impression which does not need to be diminished in\r\nthe interests of truth.[193] It is probable that Hughes's\r\nself-reliance had been badly shaken by his various meetings with\r\nSuffren.\r\n\r\nAlthough the tidings of peace sent by Hughes to Bussy rested only upon\r\nunofficial letters, they were too positive to justify a continuance of\r\nbloodshed. An arrangement was entered into by the authorities of the\r\ntwo nations in India, and hostilities ceased on the 8th of July. Two\r\nmonths later, at Pondicherry, the official despatches reached Suffren.\r\nHis own words upon them are worth quoting, for they show the\r\ndepressing convictions under which he had acted so noble a part: \"God\r\nbe praised for the peace! for it was clear that in India, though we\r\nhad the means to impose the law, all would have been lost. I await\r\nyour orders with impatience, and heartily pray they may permit me to\r\nleave. War alone can make bearable the weariness of certain things.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of October, 1783, Suffren finally sailed from Trincomalee\r\nfor France, stopping at the Isle of France and the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nThe homeward voyage was a continued and spontaneous ovation. In each\r\nport visited the most flattering attentions were paid by men of every\r\ndegree and of every nation. What especially gratified him was the\r\nhomage of the English captains. It might well be so; none had so\r\nclearly established a right to his esteem as a warrior. On no occasion\r\nwhen Hughes and Suffren met, save the last, did the English number\r\nover twelve ships; but six English captains had laid down their lives,\r\nobstinately opposing his efforts. While he was at the Cape, a division\r\nof nine of Hughes's ships, returning from the war, anchored in the\r\nharbor. Their captains called eagerly upon the admiral, the stout\r\nCommodore King of the \"Exeter\" at their head. \"The good Dutchmen have\r\nreceived me as their savior,\" wrote Suffren; \"but among the tributes\r\nwhich have most flattered me, none has given me more pleasure than the\r\nesteem and consideration testified by the English who are here.\" On\r\nreaching home, rewards were heaped upon him. Having left France as a\r\ncaptain, he came back a rear-admiral; and immediately after his return\r\nthe king created a fourth vice-admiralship, a special post to be\r\nfilled by Suffren, and to lapse at his death. These honors were won by\r\nhimself alone; they were the tribute paid to his unyielding energy and\r\ngenius, shown not only in actual fight but in the steadfastness which\r\nheld to his station through every discouragement, and rose equal to\r\nevery demand made by recurring want and misfortune.\r\n\r\nAlike in the general conduct of his operations and on the battlefield\r\nunder the fire of the enemy, this lofty resolve was the distinguishing\r\nmerit of Suffren; and when there is coupled with it the clear and\r\nabsolute conviction which he held of the necessity to seek and crush\r\nthe enemy's fleet, we have probably the leading traits of his military\r\ncharacter. The latter was the light that led him, the former the\r\nspirit that sustained him. As a tactician, in the sense of a driller\r\nof ships, imparting to them uniformity of action and manoeuvring, he\r\nseems to have been deficient, and would probably himself have\r\nadmitted, with some contempt, the justice of the criticism made upon\r\nhim in these respects. Whether or no he ever actually characterized\r\ntactics--meaning thereby elementary or evolutionary tactics--as the\r\nveil of timidity, there was that in his actions which makes the _mot_\r\nprobable. Such a contempt, however, is unsafe even in the case of\r\ngenius. The faculty of moving together with uniformity and precision\r\nis too necessary to the development of the full power of a body of\r\nships to be lightly esteemed; it is essential to that concentration of\r\neffort at which Suffren rightly aimed, but which he was not always\r\ncareful to secure by previous dispositions. Paradoxical though it\r\nsounds, it is true that only fleets which are able to perform regular\r\nmovements can afford at times to cast them aside; only captains whom\r\nthe habit of the drill-ground has familiarized with the shifting\r\nphases it presents, can be expected to seize readily the opportunities\r\nfor independent action presented by the field of battle. Howe and\r\nJervis must make ready the way for the successes of Nelson. Suffren\r\nexpected too much of his captains. He had the right to expect more\r\nthan he got, but not that ready perception of the situation and that\r\nfirmness of nerve which, except to a few favorites of Nature, are the\r\nresult only of practice and experience.\r\n\r\nStill, he was a very great man. When every deduction has been made,\r\nthere must still remain his heroic constancy, his fearlessness of\r\nresponsibility as of danger, the rapidity of his action, and the\r\ngenius whose unerring intuition led him to break through the\r\ntraditions of his service and assert for the navy that principal part\r\nwhich befits it, that offensive action which secures the control of\r\nthe sea by the destruction of the enemy's fleet. Had he met in his\r\nlieutenants such ready instruments as Nelson found prepared for him,\r\nthere can be little doubt that Hughes's squadron would have been\r\ndestroyed while inferior to Suffren's, before reinforcements could\r\nhave arrived; and with the English fleet it could scarcely have failed\r\nthat the Coromandel coast also would have fallen. What effect this\r\nwould have had upon the fate of the peninsula, or upon the terms of\r\nthe peace, can only be surmised. His own hope was that, by acquiring\r\nthe superiority in India, a glorious peace might result.\r\n\r\nNo further opportunities of distinction in war were given to Suffren.\r\nThe remaining years of his life were spent in honored positions\r\nashore. In 1788, upon an appearance of trouble with England, he was\r\nappointed to the command of a great fleet arming at Brest; but before\r\nhe could leave Paris he died suddenly on the 8th of December, in the\r\nsixtieth year of his age. There seems to have been no suspicion at\r\nthe time of other than natural causes of death, he being exceedingly\r\nstout and of apoplectic temperament; but many years after a story,\r\napparently well-founded, became current that he was killed in a duel\r\narising out of his official action in India. His old antagonist on the\r\nbattlefield, Sir Edward Hughes, died at a great age in 1794.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[168] This Commodore Johnstone, more commonly known as Governor\r\nJohnstone, was one of the three commissioners sent by Lord North in\r\n1778 to promote a reconciliation with America. Owing to certain\r\nsuspicious proceedings on his part, Congress declared it was\r\nincompatible with their honor to hold any manner of correspondence or\r\nintercourse with him. His title of Governor arose from his being at\r\none time governor of Pensacola. He had a most unenviable reputation in\r\nthe English navy. (See Charnock's Biog. Navalis.)\r\n\r\n[169] This plate is taken almost wholly from Cunat's \"Vie de Suffren.\"\r\n\r\n[170] Page 299.\r\n\r\n[171] La Serre: Essais Hist. et Critiques sur la Marine Française.\r\n\r\n[172] The question of attacking the English squadron at its anchors\r\nwas debated in a council of war. Its opinion confirmed Suffren's\r\ndecision not to do so. In contrasting this with the failure of the\r\nEnglish to attack the French detachment in Newport (p. 394), it must\r\nbe borne in mind that in the latter case there was no means of forcing\r\nthe ships to leave their strong position; whereas by threatening\r\nTrincomalee, or other less important points, Suffren could rely upon\r\ndrawing Hughes out. He was therefore right in not attacking, while the\r\nEnglish before Newport were probably wrong.\r\n\r\n[173] The dependence of Trincomalee upon the English fleet in this\r\ncampaign affords an excellent illustration of the embarrassment and\r\nfalse position in which a navy finds itself when the defence of its\r\nseaports rests upon it. This bears upon a much debated point of the\r\npresent day, and is worthy the study of those who maintain, too\r\nunqualifiedly, that the best coast defence is a navy. In one sense\r\nthis is doubtless true,--to attack the enemy abroad is the best of\r\ndefences; but in the narrow sense of the word \"defence\" it is not\r\ntrue. Trincomalee unfortified was simply a centre round which Hughes\r\nhad to revolve like a tethered animal; and the same will always happen\r\nunder like conditions.\r\n\r\n[174] Plate XIV., Fig. D, shows the order of battle Suffren intended\r\nin this action. The five rear ships of the enemy would each have two\r\nopponents close aboard. The leading French ship on the weather side\r\nwas to be kept farther off, so that while attacking the sixth\r\nEnglishman she could \"contain\" the van ships if they attempted to\r\nreinforce the rear by tacking.\r\n\r\n[175] Troude: Batailles Navales.\r\n\r\n[176] Between four and five hundred yards.\r\n\r\n[177] The English and French flag-ships are denoted in the plan by\r\ntheir exceptional size.\r\n\r\n[178] The \"Victory,\" Nelson's ship at Trafalgar, a 100-gun ship, lost\r\n57 killed and 102 wounded; Hughes's ship, a 74, lost 59 killed and 96\r\nwounded. Collingwood's ship, the \"Royal Sovereign,\" also of 100 guns,\r\nlost 47 killed and 94 wounded; the \"Monmouth,\" a 64, in Hughes's\r\naction lost 45 killed and 102 wounded.\r\n\r\n[179] Troude: Batailles Navales; Chevalier: Hist. de la Marine\r\nFrançaise.\r\n\r\n[180] This remark seems too self-evident to need emphasis; yet it may\r\nbe questioned whether naval men generally carry it in their stock of\r\naxioms.\r\n\r\n[181] As always.\r\n\r\n[182] That is turned their side to the enemy instead of approaching\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[183] Chevalier.\r\n\r\n[184] Annual Register, 1782.\r\n\r\n[185] The British account differs materially as to the cause of the\r\ndistance separating the two rears. \"In this action it did not fall to\r\nthe 'Monmouth's' lot to sustain a very considerable share, the enemy's\r\nrear being so far to leeward that the ships of the British rear could\r\nnot, even whilst the wind was favorable, close with them without\r\nconsiderably breaking the order of their own line\" (Memoir of Captain\r\nAlms, Naval Chronicle, vol. ii). Such contradictions are common, and,\r\nexcept for a particular purpose, need not to be reconciled. Alms seems\r\nto have been not only a first-rate seaman, but an officer capable of\r\nresolute and independent action; his account is probably correct.\r\n\r\n[186] Troude: Batailles Navales. It was seen from Suffren's ship that\r\nthe \"Sévère's\" flag was down; but it was supposed that the ensign\r\nhalliards had been shot away. The next day Hughes sent the captain of\r\nthe \"Sultan\" to demand the delivery to him of the ship which had\r\nstruck. The demand, of course, could not be complied with. \"The\r\n'Sultan,'\" Troude says, \"which had hove-to to take possession of the\r\n'Sévère,' was the victim of this action; she received during some\r\ntime, without replying, the whole fire of the French ship.\"\r\n\r\n[187] Annual Register, 1782.\r\n\r\n[188] Cunat: Vie de Suffren.\r\n\r\n[189] The curves in (B) represent the movements of the ships _after_\r\nthe shift of wind, which practically ended the battle.

He added: \"It is frightful to have had four times\r\nin our power to destroy the English squadron, and that it still\r\nexists.\"\r\n\r\n[192] There was not a single ship of Suffren's which had more than\r\nthree-fourths of her regular complement of men. It must be added that\r\nsoldiers and sepoys made up half of these reduced crews.--_Chevalier_,\r\np. 463.\r\n\r\n[193] You will have learned my promotion to commodore and\r\nrear-admiral. Now, I tell you in the sincerity of my heart and for\r\nyour own ear alone, that what I have done since then is worth\r\ninfinitely more than what I had done before. You know the capture and\r\nbattle of Trincomalee; but the end of the campaign, and that which\r\ntook place between the month of March and the end of June, is far\r\nabove anything that has been done in the navy since I entered it. The\r\nresult has been very advantageous to the State, for the squadron was\r\nendangered and the army lost.--_Private Letter of Suffren, Sept. 13,\r\n1783; quoted in the \"Journal de Bord du Bailli de Suffren.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n    EVENTS IN THE WEST INDIES AFTER THE SURRENDER OF\r\n    YORKTOWN--ENCOUNTERS OF DE GRASSE WITH HOOD.--THE SEA BATTLE OF\r\n    THE SAINTS.--1781, 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Cornwallis marked the end of the active war upon the\r\nAmerican continent. The issue of the struggle was indeed assured upon\r\nthe day when France devoted her sea power to the support of the\r\ncolonists; but, as not uncommonly happens, the determining\r\ncharacteristics of a period were summed up in one striking event. From\r\nthe beginning, the military question, owing to the physical\r\ncharacteristics of the country, a long seaboard with estuaries\r\npenetrating deep into the interior, and the consequent greater ease of\r\nmovement by water than by land, had hinged upon the control of the sea\r\nand the use made of that control. Its misdirection by Sir William Howe\r\nin 1777, when he moved his army to the Chesapeake instead of\r\nsupporting Burgoyne's advance, opened the way to the startling success\r\nat Saratoga, when amazed Europe saw six thousand regular troops\r\nsurrendering to a body of provincials. During the four years that\r\nfollowed, until the surrender of Yorktown, the scales rose and fell\r\naccording as the one navy or the other appeared on the scene, or as\r\nEnglish commanders kept touch with the sea or pushed their operations\r\nfar from its support. Finally, at the great crisis, all is found\r\ndepending upon the question whether the French or the English fleet\r\nshould first appear, and upon their relative force.\r\n\r\nThe maritime struggle was at once transferred to the West Indies. The\r\nevents which followed there were antecedent in time both to Suffren's\r\nbattles and to the final relief of Gibraltar; but they stand so much\r\nby themselves as to call for separate treatment, and have such close\r\nrelation to the conclusion of the war and the conditions of peace, as\r\nto form the dramatic finale of the one and the stepping-stone of\r\ntransition to the other. It is fitting indeed that a brilliant though\r\nindecisive naval victory should close the story of an essentially\r\nnaval war.\r\n\r\nThe capitulation of Yorktown was completed on the 19th of October,\r\n1781, and on the 5th of November, De Grasse, resisting the suggestions\r\nof Lafayette and Washington that the fleet should aid in carrying the\r\nwar farther south, sailed from the Chesapeake. He reached Martinique\r\non the 26th, the day after the Marquis de Bouillé, commanding the\r\nFrench troops in the West Indies, had regained by a bold surprise the\r\nDutch island of St. Eustatius. The two commanders now concerted a\r\njoint expedition against Barbadoes, which was frustrated by the\r\nviolence of the trade winds.\r\n\r\nFoiled here, the French proceeded against the island of St.\r\nChristopher, or St. Kitt's (Plate XVIII.). On the 11th of January,\r\n1782, the fleet, carrying six thousand troops, anchored on the west\r\ncoast off Basse Terre, the chief town. No opposition was met, the\r\nsmall garrison of six hundred men retiring to a fortified post ten\r\nmiles to the northwest, on Brimstone Hill, a solitary precipitous\r\nheight overlooking the lee shore of the island. The French troops\r\nlanded and pursued, but the position being found too strong for\r\nassault, siege operations were begun.\r\n\r\nThe French fleet remained at anchor in Basse Terre road. Meanwhile,\r\nnews of the attack was carried to Sir Samuel Hood, who had followed De\r\nGrasse from the continent, and, in the continued absence of Rodney,\r\nwas naval commander-in-chief on the station. He sailed from Barbadoes\r\non the 14th, anchored at Antigua on the 21st, and there embarked all\r\nthe troops that could be spared,--about seven hundred men. On the\r\nafternoon of the 23d the fleet started for St. Kitt's, carrying such\r\nsail as would bring it within striking distance of the enemy at\r\ndaylight next morning.\r\n\r\nThe English having but twenty-two ships to the French twenty-nine,\r\nand the latter being generally superior in force, class for class, it\r\nis necessary to mark closely the lay of the land in order to\r\nunderstand Hood's original plans and their subsequent modifications;\r\nfor, resultless as his attempt proved, his conduct during the next\r\nthree weeks forms the most brilliant military effort of the whole\r\nwar. The islands of St. Kitt's and Nevis (Plates XVIII. and XIX.)\r\nbeing separated only by a narrow channel, impracticable for\r\nships-of-the-line, are in effect one, and their common axis lying\r\nnorthwest and southeast, it is necessary for sailing-ships, with the\r\ntrade wind, to round the southern extremity of Nevis, from which\r\nposition the wind is fair to reach all anchorages on the lee side of\r\nthe islands. Basse Terre is about twelve miles distant from the\r\nwestern point of Nevis (Fort Charles), and its roadstead lies east\r\nand west. The French fleet were anchored there in disorder (Plate\r\nXVIII., A), three or four deep, not expecting attack, and the ships\r\nat the west end of the road could not reach those at the east without\r\nbeating to windward,--a tedious, and under fire a perilous process. A\r\nfurther most important point to note is that all the eastern ships\r\nwere so placed that vessels approaching from the southward could\r\nreach them with the usual wind.\r\n\r\nHood, therefore, we are told, intended to appear at early daylight, in\r\norder of and ready for battle, and fall upon the eastern ships, filing\r\nby them with his whole fleet (a, a'), thus concentrating the fire of\r\nall upon a few of the enemy; then turning away, so as to escape the\r\nguns of the others, he proposed, first wearing and then tacking, to\r\nkeep his fleet circling in long procession (a', a'') past that part of\r\nthe enemy's ships chosen for attack. The plan was audacious, but\r\nundeniably sound in principle; some good could hardly fail to follow,\r\nand unless De Grasse showed more readiness than he had hitherto done,\r\neven decisive results might be hoped for.[194]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. XVIII. HOOD & DE GRASSE. JAN. 25 & 26, 1782.]\r\n\r\nThe best-laid plans, however, may fail, and Hood's was balked by the\r\nawkwardness of a lieutenant of the watch, who hove-to (stopped) a\r\nfrigate at night ahead of the fleet, and was consequently run down by\r\na ship-of-the-line. The latter also received such injury as delayed\r\nthe movement, several hours being lost in repairing damages. The\r\nFrench were thus warned of the enemy's approach, and although not\r\nsuspecting his intention to attack, De Grasse feared that Hood would\r\npass down to leeward of him and disturb the siege of Brimstone\r\nHill,--an undertaking so rash for an inferior force that it is as\r\ndifficult to conceive how he could have supposed it, as to account for\r\nhis overlooking the weakness of his own position at anchor.\r\n\r\nAt one P.M. of the 24th the English fleet was seen rounding the south\r\nend of Nevis; at three De Grasse got under way and stood to the\r\nsouthward. Toward sundown Hood also went about and stood south, as\r\nthough retreating; but he was well to windward of his opponent, and\r\nmaintained this advantage through the night. At daybreak both fleets\r\nwere to leeward of Nevis,--the English near the island, the French\r\nabout nine miles distant (Plate XIX.). Some time was spent in\r\nmanoeuvring, with the object on Hood's part of getting the French\r\nadmiral yet more to leeward; for, having failed in his first attempt,\r\nhe had formed the yet bolder intention of seizing the anchorage his\r\nunskilful opponent had left, and establishing himself there in an\r\nimpregnable manner. In this he succeeded, as will be shown; but to\r\nunderstand the justification for a movement confessedly hazardous, it\r\nmust be pointed out that he thus would place himself between the\r\nbesiegers of Brimstone Hill and their fleet; or if the latter anchored\r\nnear the hill, the English fleet would be between it and its base in\r\nMartinique, ready to intercept supplies or detachments approaching\r\nfrom the southward. In short, the position in which Hood hoped to\r\nestablish himself was on the flank of the enemy's communications, a\r\nposition the more advantageous because the island alone could not long\r\nsupport the large body of troops so suddenly thrown upon it.\r\nMoreover, both fleets were expecting reinforcements; Rodney was on his\r\nway and might arrive first, which he did, and in time to save St.\r\nKitt's, which he did not. It was also but four months since Yorktown;\r\nthe affairs of England were going badly; something must be done,\r\nsomething left to chance, and Hood knew himself and his officers. It\r\nmay be added that he knew his opponent.\r\n\r\nAt noon, when the hillsides of Nevis were covered with expectant and\r\ninterested sightseers, the English fleet rapidly formed its line on\r\nthe starboard tack and headed north for Basse Terre (Plate XIX., A,\r\nA'). The French, at the moment, were in column steering south, but\r\nwent about at once and stood for the enemy in a bow-and-quarter\r\nline[195] (A, A). At two the British had got far enough for Hood to\r\nmake signal to anchor. At twenty minutes past two the van of the\r\nFrench came within gunshot of the English centre (B, B, B), and\r\nshortly afterward the firing began, the assailants very properly\r\ndirecting their main effort upon the English rear ships, which, as\r\nhappens with most long columns, had opened out, a tendency increased\r\nin this case by the slowness of the fourth ship from the rear, the\r\n\"Prudent.\" The French flag-ship, \"Ville de Paris,\" of one hundred and\r\ntwenty guns, bearing De Grasse's flag, pushed for the gap thus made,\r\nbut was foiled by the \"Canada,\" seventy-four, whose captain,\r\nCornwallis, the brother of Lord Cornwallis, threw all his sails aback,\r\nand dropped down in front of the huge enemy to the support of the\r\nrear,--an example nobly followed by the \"Resolution\" and the \"Bedford\"\r\nimmediately ahead of him (a). The scene was now varied and animated in\r\nthe extreme. The English van, which had escaped attack, was rapidly\r\nanchoring (b) in its appointed position. The commander-in-chief in the\r\ncentre, proudly reliant upon the skill and conduct of his captains,\r\nmade signal for the ships ahead to carry a press of sail, and gain\r\ntheir positions regardless of the danger to the threatened rear. The\r\nlatter, closely pressed and outnumbered, stood on unswervingly,\r\nshortened sail, and came to anchor, one by one, in a line ahead (B,\r\nB'), under the roar of the guns of their baffled enemies. The latter\r\nfiled by, delivered their fire, and bore off again to the southward,\r\nleaving their former berths to their weaker but clever antagonists.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. XIX. HOOD & DE GRASSE. JAN. 25, 1782.]\r\n\r\nThe anchorage thus brilliantly taken by Hood was not exactly the same\r\nas that held by De Grasse the day before; but as it covered and\r\ncontrolled it, his claim that he took up the place the other had left\r\nis substantially correct. The following night and morning were spent\r\nin changing and strengthening the order, which was finally established\r\nas follows (Plate XVIII., B, B'). The van ship was anchored about four\r\nmiles southeast from Basse Terre, so close to the shore that a ship\r\ncould not pass inside her, nor, with the prevailing wind, even reach\r\nher, because of a point and shoal just outside, covering her position.\r\nFrom this point the line extended in a west-northwest direction to the\r\ntwelfth or thirteenth ship (from a mile and a quarter to a mile and a\r\nhalf), where it turned gradually but rapidly to north, the last six\r\nships being on a north and south line. Hood's flag-ship, the\r\n\"Barfleur,\" of ninety guns, was at the apex of the salient angle thus\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been impossible for the French fleet to take the\r\nanchorage they formerly held; but it and all others to leeward were\r\nforbidden by the considerations already stated, so long as Hood\r\nremained where he was. It became necessary therefore to dislodge him,\r\nbut this was rendered exceedingly difficult by the careful tactical\r\ndispositions that have been described. His left flank was covered by\r\nthe shore. Any attempt to enfilade his front by passing along the\r\nother flank was met by the broadsides of the six or eight ships drawn\r\nup _en potence_ to the rear. The front commanded the approaches to\r\nBasse Terre. To attack him in the rear, from the northwest, was\r\nforbidden by the trade-wind. To these difficulties was to be added\r\nthat the attack must be made under sail against ships at anchor, to\r\nwhom loss of spars would be of no immediate concern; and which, having\r\nsprings[196] out, could train their broadsides over a large area with\r\ngreat ease.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, both sound policy and mortification impelled De Grasse\r\nto fight, which he did the next day, January 26. The method of attack,\r\nin single column of twenty-nine ships against a line so carefully\r\narranged, was faulty in the extreme; but it may be doubted whether any\r\ncommander of that day would have broken through the traditional\r\nfighting order.[197] Hood had intended the same, but he hoped a\r\nsurprise on an ill-ordered enemy, and at the original French anchorage\r\nit was possible to reach their eastern ships, with but slight exposure\r\nto concentrated fire. Not so now. The French formed to the southward\r\nand steered for the eastern flank of Hood's line. As their van ship\r\ndrew up with the point already mentioned, the wind headed her, so that\r\nshe could only reach the third in the English order, the first four\r\nships of which, using their springs, concentrated their guns upon her.\r\nThis vessel was supposed by the English to be the \"Pluton,\" and if so,\r\nher captain was D'Albert de Rions, in Suffren's opinion the foremost\r\nofficer of the French navy. \"The crash occasioned by their destructive\r\nbroadsides,\" wrote an English officer who was present, \"was so\r\ntremendous that whole pieces of plank were seen flying from her off\r\nside ere she could escape the cool, concentrated fire of her\r\ndetermined adversaries. As she proceeded along the British line, she\r\nreceived the first fire of every ship in passing. She was indeed in\r\nso shattered a state as to be compelled to bear away for St.\r\nEustatius.\" And so ship after ship passed by, running the length of\r\nthe line (Plate XVIII., B, B), distributing their successive fires in\r\ngallant but dreary, ineffectual monotony over the whole extent. A\r\nsecond time that day De Grasse attacked in the same order, but\r\nneglecting the English van, directed his effort upon the rear and\r\ncentre. This was equally fruitless, and seems to have been done with\r\nlittle spirit.\r\n\r\nFrom that time until the 14th of February, Hood maintained his\r\nposition in sight of the French fleet, which remained cruising in the\r\noffing and to the southward. On the 1st a despatch vessel arrived from\r\nKempenfeldt, informing him of the dispersal of the French\r\nreinforcements for the West Indies, which must have renewed his hopes\r\nthat his bold attempt would be successful through Rodney's arrival. It\r\nwas not, however, to be so. Brimstone Hill surrendered on the 12th,\r\nafter a creditable defence. On the 13th De Grasse took his fleet, now\r\namounting to thirty-three ships-of-the-line, to Nevis, and anchored\r\nthere. On the night of the 14th Hood summoned all his captains on\r\nboard, had them set their watches by his, and at eleven P.M., one\r\nafter another, without noise or signal, cut their cables and made sail\r\nto the northward, passing round that end of the island unnoticed, or\r\nat least unmolested, by the French.\r\n\r\nBoth strategically and tactically Hood's conceptions and dispositions\r\nwere excellent, and their execution was most honorable to the skill\r\nand steadiness of himself and his captains. Regarded as a single\r\nmilitary operation, this was brilliant throughout; but when considered\r\nwith reference to the general situation of England at the time, a much\r\nhigher estimate must be formed of the admiral's qualities.[198] St.\r\nKitt's in itself might not be worth a great risk; but it was of the\r\nfirst importance that energy and audacity should be carried into the\r\nconduct of England's naval war, that some great success should light\r\nupon her flag. Material success was not obtained. The chances, though\r\nfair enough, turned against Hood; but every man in that fleet must\r\nhave felt the glow of daring achievement, the assured confidence which\r\nfollows a great deed nobly done. Had this man been in chief command\r\nwhen greater issues were at stake, had he been first instead of second\r\nat the Chesapeake, Cornwallis might have been saved. The\r\noperation--seizing an anchorage left by the enemy--would have been\r\nnearly the same; and both situations may be instructively compared\r\nwith Suffren's relief of Cuddalore.\r\n\r\nThe action of De Grasse, also, should be considered not only with\r\nreference to the particular occasion, but to the general condition of\r\nthe war as well, and when thus weighed, and further compared with\r\nother very similar opportunities neglected by this general officer, a\r\nfair estimate of his military capacity can be reached. This\r\ncomparison, however, is better deferred to the now not very distant\r\nclose of the campaign. The most useful comment to be made here is,\r\nthat his action in failing to crush Hood at his anchors, with a force\r\nat least fifty per cent greater, was in strict accordance with the\r\ngeneral French principle of subordinating the action of the fleet to\r\nso-called particular operations; for nothing is more instructive than\r\nto note how an unsound principle results in disastrous action. Hood's\r\ninferiority was such as to weaken, for offensive purposes, his\r\ncommanding position. So long as De Grasse kept to windward, he\r\nmaintained his communications with Martinique, and he was strong\r\nenough, too, to force communication when necessary with the troops\r\nbefore Brimstone Hill. It was probable, as the event showed, that the\r\nparticular operation, the reduction of St. Kitt's, would succeed\r\ndespite the presence of the English fleet; and \"the French navy has\r\nalways preferred the glory of assuring a conquest to that, more\r\nbrilliant perhaps but less real, of taking a few ships.\"\r\n\r\nSo far De Grasse may be acquitted of any error beyond that of not\r\nrising above the traditions of his service. Some days, however, before\r\nthe surrender of the island and the departure of the English fleet, he\r\nwas joined by two ships-of-the-line which brought him word of the\r\ndispersal of the expected convoy and reinforcements from Europe.[199]\r\nHe then knew that he himself could not be strengthened before Rodney's\r\narrival, and that by that event the English would be superior to him.\r\nHe had actually thirty-three ships-of-the-line in hand, and a few\r\nmiles off lay twenty-two English in a position where he knew they\r\nwould await his attack; yet he let them escape. His own explanation\r\nimplies clearly that he had no intention of attacking them at\r\nanchor:--\r\n\r\n    \"The day after the capitulation of Brimstone Hill was the moment\r\n    to watch Hood closely, and to fight him _as soon as he got under\r\n    way_ from the conquered island. But our provisions were\r\n    exhausted; We had only enough for thirty-six hours. Some\r\n    supply-ships had arrived at Nevis, and you will admit one must\r\n    live before fighting. I went to Nevis, always to windward and in\r\n    sight of the enemy, a league and a half from him, in order to\r\n    take on board the necessary supplies as rapidly as possible.\r\n    Hood decamped at night without signals, and the next morning I\r\n    found only the sick whom he left behind.\"[200]\r\n\r\nIn other words, Hood having held his ground with consummate audacity\r\nand skill, when he had some chance of successful resistance, declined\r\nto await his adversary's attack under conditions overwhelmingly\r\nunfavorable. What shall be said of this talk about provisions? Did not\r\nthe Comte de Grasse know a month before how long, to a day, the\r\nsupplies on board would last? Did he not know, four days before Hood\r\nsailed, that he had with him every ship he could probably count on for\r\nthe approaching campaign, while the English would surely be\r\nreinforced? And if the English position was as strong as good\r\njudgment, professional skill, and bold hearts could make it, had it\r\nnot weak points? Were not the lee ships to leeward? If they did\r\nattempt to beat to windward, had he not ships to \"contain\" them? If\r\nthe van ship could not be reached, had he not force enough to double\r\nand treble on the third and following ships, as far down the line as\r\nhe chose? A letter of Suffren's, referring to a similar condition of\r\nthings at Santa Lucia,[201] but written three years before these\r\nevents, seems almost a prophetic description of them:--\r\n\r\n    \"Notwithstanding the slight results of the two cannonades of\r\n    December 15 [1778], we can yet expect success; but the only way\r\n    to attain it is to attack vigorously the squadron, which in\r\n    consequence of our superiority cannot hold out, despite their\r\n    land works, which will become of no effect _if we lay them on\r\n    board, or anchor upon their buoys_. If we delay, a thousand\r\n    circumstances may save them. _They may profit by the night to\r\n    depart._\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the English would have sold their defeat\r\ndearly; but results in war must be paid for, and the best are in the\r\nlong run the cheapest. A tight grip of a few simple principles--that\r\nthe enemy's fleet was the controlling factor in the coming campaign,\r\nthat it was therefore his true objective, that one fraction of it must\r\nbe crushed without delay when caught thus separated--would have saved\r\nDe Grasse a great blunder; but it is only fair to note that it would\r\nhave made him an exception to the practice of the French navy.\r\n\r\nThe hour was now close at hand when the French admiral should feel,\r\neven if he did not admit, the consequences of this mistake, by which he\r\nhad won a paltry island and lost an English fleet. Rodney had sailed\r\nfrom Europe on the 15th of January, with twelve ships-of-the-line. On\r\nthe 19th of February he anchored at Barbadoes, and the same day Hood\r\nreached Antigua from St. Kitt's. On the 25th the squadrons of Rodney\r\nand Hood met to windward of Antigua, forming a united fleet of\r\nthirty-four ships-of-the-line. The next day De Grasse anchored in Fort\r\nRoyal, thus escaping the pursuit which Rodney at once began. The\r\nEnglish admiral then returned to Sta. Lucia, where he was joined by\r\nthree more ships-of-the-line from England, raising his force to\r\nthirty-seven. Knowing that a large convoy was expected from France,\r\nbefore the arrival of which nothing could be attempted, Rodney sent a\r\npart of his fleet to cruise to windward and as far north as Guadeloupe;\r\nbut the officer in charge of the French convoy, suspecting this action,\r\nkept well north of that island, and reached Fort Royal, Martinique, on\r\nthe 20th of March. The ships-of-war with him raised De Grasse's fleet\r\nto thirty-three effective sail-of-the-line and two fifty-gun ships.\r\n\r\nThe object of the united efforts of France and Spain this year was the\r\nconquest of Jamaica. It was expected to unite at Cap Français (now Cap\r\nHaïtien), in Hayti, fifty ships-of-the-line and twenty thousand\r\ntroops. Part of the latter were already at the rendezvous; and De\r\nGrasse, appointed to command the combined fleets, was to collect in\r\nMartinique all the available troops and supplies in the French\r\nislands, and convoy them to the rendezvous. It was this junction that\r\nRodney was charged to prevent.\r\n\r\nThe region within which occurred the important operations of the next\r\nfew days covers a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, from south\r\nto north, including the islands of Sta. Lucia, Martinique, Dominica,\r\nand Guadeloupe, in the order named. (See Plate XI. p. 378.) At this\r\ntime the first was in English, the others in French, hands. The final,\r\nand for the moment decisive, encounter took place between, and a\r\nlittle to westward of, Dominica and Guadeloupe. These are\r\ntwenty-three miles apart; but the channel is narrowed to thirteen by\r\nthree islets called the Saints, lying ten miles south of Guadeloupe.\r\nIt is said to have been De Grasse's intention, instead of sailing\r\ndirect for Cap Français,[202] to take a circuitous course near the\r\nislands, which, being friendly or neutral, would give refuge to the\r\nconvoy if pressed. The close pursuit of the English, who came up with\r\nhim off Dominica, led him to forsake this plan, sending the convoy\r\ninto Basse Terre at the south end of Guadeloupe, while with the fleet\r\nhe tried to beat through the channel and pass east of the island, thus\r\ndrawing the English away from the transports and ridding himself of\r\nthe tactical embarrassment due to the latter's presence. Accidents to\r\nvarious ships thwarted this attempt, and brought about a battle\r\ndisastrous to him and fatal to the joint enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe anchorages of the two fleets, in Martinique and Sta. Lucia, were\r\nthirty miles apart. The prevailing east wind is generally fair to pass\r\nfrom one to the other; but a strong westerly current, and the\r\nfrequency of calms and light airs, tend to throw to leeward\r\nsailing-ships leaving Sta. Lucia for the northern island. A chain of\r\nfrigates connected the English lookout ships off Martinique, by\r\nsignal, with Rodney's flag-ship in Gros Ilot Bay. Everything was astir\r\nat the two stations, the French busy with the multitudinous\r\narrangements necessitated by a great military undertaking, the English\r\nwith less to do, yet maintaining themselves in a state of expectancy\r\nand preparation for instant action, that entails constant alertness\r\nand mental activity.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of April Rodney was informed that the soldiers were being\r\nembarked, and on the 8th, soon after daylight, the lookout frigates\r\nwere seen making signal that the enemy was leaving port. The English\r\nfleet at once began to get under way, and by noon was clear of the\r\nharbor to the number of thirty-six of the line. At half-past two P.M.\r\nthe advanced frigates were in sight of the French fleet, which was\r\nseen from the mastheads of the main body just before sundown. The\r\nEnglish stood to the northward all night, and at daybreak of the 9th\r\nwere abreast Dominica, but for the most part becalmed. In-shore of\r\nthem, to the northward and eastward, were seen the French fleet and\r\nconvoy: the men-of-war numbering thirty-three of the line, besides\r\nsmaller vessels; the convoy a hundred and fifty sail, under special\r\ncharge of the two fifty-gun ships. The irregular and uncertain winds,\r\ncommon to the night and early hours of the day near the land, had\r\nscattered these unwieldy numbers. Fifteen sail-of-the-line were in the\r\nchannel between Dominica and the Saints, with a fresh trade-wind,\r\napparently beating to windward; the remainder of the ships-of-war and\r\nmost of the convoy were still becalmed close under Dominica (Plate\r\nXX., Position I, b). Gradually, however, one by one, the French ships\r\nwere catching light airs off the land; and by favor of these, which\r\ndid not reach so far as the English in the offing, drew out from the\r\nisland and entered the more steady breeze of the channel, reinforcing\r\nthe group which was thus possessed of that prime element of naval\r\npower, mobility. At the same time light airs from the southeast crept\r\nout to the English van under Hood, fanning it gently north from the\r\nmain body of the fleet toward two isolated French ships (i), which,\r\nhaving fallen to leeward during the night, had shared the calms that\r\nleft the English motionless, with their heads all round the compass.\r\nThey had come nearly within gunshot, when a light puff from the\r\nnorthwest enabled the Frenchmen to draw away and approach their own\r\nships in the channel.\r\n\r\nThe farther the English van advanced, the fresher grew their wind,\r\nuntil they fairly opened the channel of the Saints and felt the\r\ntrade-wind. De Grasse signalled to the convoy to put into Guadeloupe,\r\nwhich order was so well carried out that they were all out of sight to\r\nthe northward by two in the afternoon, and will appear no more in the\r\nsequel. The two French ships, already spoken of as fallen to leeward,\r\nnot being yet out of danger from the English van, which had now a\r\ncommanding breeze, and the latter being much separated from their rear\r\nand centre, De Grasse ordered his van to bear down and engage. This\r\nwas obeyed by the ships signalled and by three others, in all by\r\nfourteen or fifteen, the action beginning at half-past nine A.M., and\r\nlasting with intermissions until quarter-past one P.M. Hood was soon\r\nforced to heave-to, in order not to increase too much his separation\r\nfrom the main fleet; the French kept under way, approaching from the\r\nrear and passing in succession at half cannon-shot to windward (Plate\r\nXX., Position I.). As each ship drew ahead of the English division,\r\nshe tacked, standing back to the southward until in position to resume\r\nher place in the order of attack, thus describing a continuous\r\nirregular curve of elliptical form, to windward of their opponents.\r\nThe brunt of the attack fell upon eight or nine of the English, this\r\nnumber being successively increased as one ship after another, as the\r\nbaffling airs served, drew out from the calm space under Dominica; but\r\nthe French received similar accessions. While this engagement was\r\ngoing on, part of the English centre, eight ships with Rodney's flag\r\namong them (Position I., a), by carefully watching the puffs and\r\ncat's-paws, had worked in with the land and caught the sea breeze,\r\nwhich was felt there sooner than in the offing. As soon as they had\r\nit, about eleven A.M., they stood to the north, being now on the\r\nweather quarter[203] both of the English van and its assailants\r\n(Position II., a). The latter, seeing this, tacked, and abandoning the\r\ncontest for the moment, steered south to join their centre, lest\r\nRodney's eight ships should get between them. At half-past eleven the\r\nFrench again formed line on the starboard tack, most of their ships\r\nbeing now clear of the land, while the English rear was still\r\nbecalmed. The greater numbers of the French enabled them to extend\r\nfrom north to south along the length of the English line, whereas the\r\nlatter was still broken by a great gap between the van and centre\r\n(Position II.). The attack upon Hood was therefore hotly renewed;\r\nbut the French centre and rear (b), having the wind, kept their\r\ndistance, and held Rodney's division at long range. At quarter-past\r\none the French, finding that the whole British line was coming up with\r\nthe wind, ceased firing, and at two Rodney hauled down the signal for\r\nbattle, the enemy having withdrawn.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. XX. RODNEY & DE GRASSE. APRIL 9, 1782.]\r\n\r\nThis action of the 9th of April amounted actually to no more than an\r\nartillery duel. One French ship, the \"Caton,\" a sixty-four (d),\r\nreceived injuries which sent her into Guadeloupe; two English were\r\ndisabled, but repaired their injuries without leaving the fleet. The\r\nmaterial advantage, therefore, lay with the latter. Opinions differ as\r\nto the generalship of the Comte de Grasse on this day, but they divide\r\non the same basis of principle as to whether ulterior operations, or\r\nthe chances of beating the enemy's fleet, are to determine an\r\nadmiral's action. The facts of the case are these: Sixteen of the\r\nEnglish fleet, all the rear and four of the centre (Position II., c),\r\nwere not able at any time to fire a shot. Apparently every French\r\nship, first and last, might have been brought into action. At the\r\nbeginning, eight or nine English were opposed to fifteen French. At\r\nthe end there were twenty English to thirty-three French, and these\r\ngeneral proportions doubtless obtained throughout the four hours. De\r\nGrasse therefore found himself in the presence of a fleet superior to\r\nhis own, in numbers at least, and by the favor of Providence that\r\nfleet so divided that nearly half of it was powerless to act. He had\r\nthe wind, he had a fine body of captains; what was to prevent him from\r\nattacking Hood's nine ships with fifteen, putting one on each side of\r\nthe six in the rear. Had those nine been thoroughly beaten, Rodney's\r\nfurther movements must have been hopelessly crippled. The French lost\r\nonly five in their defeat three days later. The subsequent\r\ncourt-martial, however, laid down the French doctrine thus: \"The\r\ndecision to persist in engaging with only a part of our fleet may be\r\nconsidered as an act of prudence on the part of the admiral, which\r\nmight be dictated by the ulterior projects of the campaign.\" On this a\r\nFrench professional writer naturally remarks, that if an attack were\r\nmade at all, it would be more prudent to make it in force; less injury\r\nwould fall on individual ships, while in the end the whole fleet would\r\ninevitably be drawn in to support any which, by losing spars, could\r\nnot return to windward.\r\n\r\nThree times in one year had Fortune thrown before De Grasse the\r\nopportunity of attacking English fleets with decisive odds on his\r\nside.[204] Her favors were now exhausted. Three days more were to show\r\nhow decidedly the ulterior projects of a campaign may be affected by a\r\nbattle and the loss of a few ships. From the 9th to the morning of the\r\n12th the French fleet continued beating to windward between Dominica\r\nand the Saints, in no regular order. On the night of the 9th the\r\nEnglish hove-to to repair damages. The next day the chase to windward\r\nwas resumed, but the French gained very decidedly upon their pursuers.\r\nOn the night of the 10th two ships, the \"Jason\" and \"Zélé,\" collided.\r\nThe \"Zélé\" was the bane of the French fleet during these days. She was\r\none of those that were nearly caught by the enemy on the 9th, and was\r\nalso the cause of the final disaster. The injuries to the \"Jason\"\r\nforced her to put into Guadeloupe. On the 11th the main body was to\r\nwindward of the Saints, but the \"Zélé\" and another had fallen so far\r\nto leeward that De Grasse bore down to cover them, thus losing much of\r\nthe ground gained. On the night following, the \"Zélé\" was again in\r\ncollision, this time with De Grasse's flag-ship; the latter lost some\r\nsails, but the other, which had not the right of way and was wholly at\r\nfault, carried away both foremast and bowsprit. The admiral sent word\r\nto the frigate \"Astrée\" to take the \"Zélé\" in tow; and here flits\r\nacross the page of our story a celebrated and tragical figure, for the\r\ncaptain of the \"Astrée\" was the ill-fated explorer Lapeyrouse, the\r\nmystery of whose disappearance with two ships and their entire crews\r\nremained so long unsolved. Two hours were consumed in getting the ship\r\nunder way in tow of the frigate,--not very smart work under the\r\nconditions of weather and urgency; but by five A.M. the two were\r\nstanding away for Basse Terre, where the \"Caton\" and \"Jason,\" as well\r\nas the convoy, had already arrived. The French fleet had thus lost\r\nthree from its line-of-battle since leaving Martinique.\r\n\r\nThe disabled ship had not long been headed for Basse Terre, when the\r\nfaint streaks of dawn announced the approach of the 12th of April, a\r\nday doubly celebrated in naval annals. The sun had not quite set upon\r\nthe exhausted squadrons of Suffren and Hughes, anchoring after their\r\nfiercest battle off Ceylon, when his early rays shone upon the opening\r\nstrife between Rodney and De Grasse.[205] The latter was at the time\r\nthe greatest naval battle in its results that had been fought in a\r\ncentury; its influence on the course of events was very great, though\r\nfar from as decisive as it might have been; it was attended with\r\ncircumstances of unusual though somewhat factitious brilliancy, and\r\nparticularly was marked by a manoeuvre that was then looked upon as\r\nexceptionally daring and decisive,--\"breaking the line.\" It must be\r\nadded that it has given rise to a storm of controversy; and the mass\r\nof details, as given by witnesses who should be reliable, are so\r\nconfused and contradictory, owing mainly to the uncertainties of the\r\nwind, that it is impossible now to do more than attempt to reconcile\r\nthem in a full account. Nevertheless, the leading features can be\r\npresented with sufficient accuracy, and this will first be done\r\nbriefly and barely; the outline thus presented can afterward be\r\nclothed with the details which give color, life, and interest to the\r\ngreat scene.\r\n\r\nAt daylight[206] (about half-past five) the English fleet, which had\r\ngone about at two A.M., was standing on the starboard tack, with the\r\nwind at southeast,[207] an unusual amount of southing for that hour\r\n(Plate XXI., A). It was then about fifteen miles from the Saints,\r\nwhich bore north-northeast, and ten from the French fleet, which bore\r\nnortheast. The latter, owing to the events of the night, was greatly\r\nscattered, as much as eight or ten miles separating the weather, or\r\neasternmost, ships from the lee,[208] the flag-ship \"Ville de Paris\"\r\nbeing among the latter. Anxiety for the \"Zélé\" kept the French\r\nadmiral, with the ships in his company, under short canvas, standing\r\nto the southward on the port tack (A). The English on the starboard\r\ntack, with the wind as they had it,[3] headed east-northeast, and\r\nthus, as soon as there was light to see, found the French \"broad on\r\nthe lee bow, and one of M. de Grasse's ships (the \"Zélé\") towed by a\r\nfrigate, square under our lee (a), with his bowsprit and foremast\r\nprostrate across his forecastle.\"[209] To draw the French farther to\r\nleeward, Rodney detached four ships (b) to chase the \"Zélé.\" As soon\r\nas De Grasse saw this he signalled his fleet to keep away (c), as\r\nRodney wished, and at the same time to form the line-of-battle, thus\r\ncalling down to him the ships to windward. The English line was also\r\nformed rapidly, and the chasing ships recalled at seven A.M. De\r\nGrasse, seeing that if he stood on he would lose the weather-gage\r\naltogether, hauled up again on the port tack (c'); and the breeze\r\nchanging to east-southeast and east in his favor and knocking the\r\nEnglish off, the race of the two fleets on opposite tacks, for the\r\nadvantage of the wind, became nearly equal. The French, however, won,\r\nthanks to a superiority in sailing which had enabled them to draw so\r\nfar to windward of the English on the previous days, and, but for the\r\nawkwardness of the \"Zélé,\" might have cleared them altogether (Plate\r\nXXI., B). Their leading ships first reached and passed the point where\r\nthe rapidly converging tracks intersected, while the English leader,\r\nthe \"Marlborough,\" struck the French line between the sixth and\r\ntenth ships (variously stated). The battle, of course, had by this\r\ntime begun, the ninth ship in the French line, the \"Brave,\" opening\r\nfire at twenty minutes before eight A.M. upon the \"Marlborough.\" As\r\nthere was no previous intention of breaking the line, the English\r\nleader kept away, in obedience to a signal from Rodney, and ran close\r\nalong under the enemy's lee, followed in succession by all the ships\r\nas they reached her wake. The battle thus assumed the common and\r\nindecisive phase of two fleets passing on opposite tacks, the wind\r\nvery light, however, and so allowing a more heavy engagement than\r\ncommon under these circumstances, the ships \"sliding by\" at the rate\r\nof three to four knots. Since the hostile lines diverged again south\r\nof their point of meeting, De Grasse made signal to keep away four\r\npoints to south-southwest, thus bringing his van (B, a) to action with\r\nthe English rear, and not permitting the latter to reach his rear\r\nunscathed. There were, however, two dangers threatening the French if\r\nthey continued their course. Its direction, south or south-southwest,\r\ncarried them into the calms that hung round the north end of Dominica;\r\nand the uncertainty of the wind made it possible that by its hauling\r\nto the southward the enemy could pass through their line and gain the\r\nwind, and with it the possibility of forcing the decisive battle which\r\nthe French policy had shunned; and this was in fact what happened. De\r\nGrasse therefore made signal at half-past eight to wear _together_ and\r\ntake the same tack as the English. This, however, was impossible; the\r\ntwo fleets were too close together to admit the evolution. He then\r\nsignalled to haul close to the wind and wear _in succession_, which\r\nalso failed to be done, and at five minutes past nine the dreaded\r\ncontingency arose; the wind hauled to the southward, knocking off all\r\nthe French ships that had not yet kept away; that is, all who had\r\nEnglish ships close under their lee (Plate XXI. C). Rodney, in the\r\n\"Formidable,\" was at this time just drawing up with the fourth ship\r\nastern of De Grasse's flag. Luffing to the new wind, he passed through\r\nthe French line, followed by the five ships next astern of him (C,\r\na), while nearly at the same moment, and from the same causes, his\r\nsixth astern (C, b) led through the interval abreast him, followed by\r\nthe whole English rear. The French line-of-battle was thus broken in\r\ntwo places by columns of enemies' ships in such close order as to\r\nforce its vessels aside, even if the wind had not conspired to\r\nembarrass their action. Every principle upon which a line-of-battle\r\nwas constituted, for mutual support and for the clear field of fire of\r\neach ship, was thus overthrown for the French, and preserved for the\r\nEnglish divisions which filed through; and the French were forced off\r\nto leeward by the interposition of the enemy's columns, besides being\r\nbroken up. Compelled thus to forsake the line upon which they had been\r\nranged, it was necessary to re-form upon another, and unite the three\r\ngroups into which they were divided,--a difficult piece of tactics\r\nunder any circumstances, but doubly so under the moral impression of\r\ndisaster, and in presence of a superior enemy, who, though himself\r\ndisordered, was in better shape, and already felt the glow of victory.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Pl. XXI. RODNEY & DE GRASSE. APRIL 12, 1782.]\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that any substantial attempt to re-form was made by\r\nthe French. To reunite, yes; but only as a flying, disordered mass.\r\nThe various shifts of wind and movements of the divisions left their\r\nfleet, at midday (Plate XXI. D), with the centre (c) two miles\r\nnorthwest of and to leeward of the van (v), the rear (r) yet farther\r\nfrom the centre and to leeward of it. Calms and short puffs of wind\r\nprevailed now through both fleets. At half-past one P.M. a light\r\nbreeze from the east sprang up, and De Grasse made signal to form the\r\nline again on the port tack; between three and four, not having\r\nsucceeded in this, he made signal to form on the starboard tack. The\r\ntwo signals and the general tenor of the accounts show that at no time\r\nwere the French re-formed after their line was broken; and all the\r\nmanoeuvres tended toward, even if they did not necessitate, taking the\r\nwhole fleet as far down as the most leewardly of its parts (D). In\r\nsuch a movement, it followed of course that the most crippled ships\r\nwere left behind, and these were picked up, one by one, by the\r\nEnglish, who pursued without any regular order, for which there was\r\nno need, as mutual support was assured without it. Shortly after six\r\nP.M. De Grasse's flag-ship, the \"Ville de Paris,\" struck her colors to\r\nthe \"Barfleur,\" carrying the flag of Sir Samuel Hood. The French\r\naccounts state that nine of the enemy's ships then surrounded her, and\r\nthere is no doubt that she had been fought to the bitter end. Her\r\nname, commemorating the great city whose gift she had been to the\r\nking, her unusual size, and the fact that no French naval\r\ncommander-in-chief had before been taken prisoner in battle, conspired\r\nto bestow a peculiar brilliancy upon Rodney's victory. Four other\r\nships-of-the-line were taken,[210] and, singularly enough, upon these\r\nparticular ships was found the whole train of artillery intended for\r\nthe reduction of Jamaica.\r\n\r\nSuch were the leading features of the Battle of the Saints, or, as it\r\nis sometimes styled, of the 12th of April, known to the French as the\r\nBattle of Dominica. Certain points which have so far been omitted for\r\nthe sake of clearness, but which affect the issue, must now be given.\r\nWhen the day opened, the French fleet was greatly scattered and\r\nwithout order.[211] De Grasse, under the influence of his fears for\r\nthe \"Zélé,\" so precipitated his movements that his line was not\r\nproperly formed at the moment of engaging. The van ships had not yet\r\ncome into position (B, a), and the remainder were so far from having\r\nreached their places that De Vaudreuil, commanding the rear division\r\nand last engaged, states that the line was formed under the fire of\r\nmusketry. The English, on the contrary, were in good order, the only\r\nchange made being to shorten the interval between ships from two to\r\none cable's length (seven hundred feet). The celebrated stroke of\r\nbreaking through the French line was due, not to previous intention,\r\nbut to a shift of wind throwing their ships out of order and so\r\nincreasing the spaces between them; while the gap through which\r\nRodney's group penetrated was widened by the \"Diadème\" on its north\r\nside being taken aback and paying round on the other tack (C, c.) Sir\r\nCharles Douglas says the immediate effect, where the flag-ship broke\r\nthrough, was \"the bringing together, almost if not quite in contact\r\nwith each other, the four ships of the enemy which were nearest,\" on\r\nthe north, \"to the point alluded to (c), and coming up in succession.\r\nThis unfortunate group, composing now only one large single object at\r\nwhich to fire, was attacked by the \"Duke,\" \"Namur,\" and \"Formidable\"\r\n(ninety-gun ships) all at once, receiving several broadsides from\r\neach, not a single shot missing; and great must have been the\r\nslaughter.\" The \"Duke\" (C, d), being next ahead of the flag-ship, had\r\nfollowed her leader under the French lee; but as soon as her captain\r\nsaw that the \"Formidable\" had traversed the enemy's order, he did the\r\nsame, passing north of this confused group and so bringing it under a\r\nfire from both sides. The log of the \"Magnanime,\" one of the group,\r\nmentions passing under the fire of two three-deckers, one on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the order was thus broken, Rodney hauled down the signal\r\nfor the line, keeping flying that for close action, and at the same\r\ntime ordered his van, which had now passed beyond and north of the\r\nenemy's rear, to go about and rejoin the English centre. This was\r\ngreatly delayed through the injuries to spars and sails received in\r\npassing under the enemy's fire. His own flag-ship and the ships with\r\nher went about. The rear, under Hood, instead of keeping north again\r\nto join the centre, stood to windward for a time, and were then\r\nbecalmed at a considerable distance from the rest of the fleet.\r\n\r\nMuch discussion took place at a later day as to the wisdom of Rodney's\r\naction in breaking through his enemy's order, and to whom the credit,\r\nif any, should be ascribed. The latter point is of little concern; but\r\nit may be said that the son of Sir Charles Douglas, Rodney's\r\nchief-of-staff, brought forward an amount of positive evidence, the\r\nonly kind that could be accepted to diminish the credit of the person\r\nwholly responsible for the results, which proves that the suggestion\r\ncame from Douglas, and Rodney's consent was with difficulty obtained.\r\nThe value of the manoeuvre itself is of more consequence than any\r\nquestion of personal reputation. It has been argued by some that, so\r\nfar from being a meritorious act, it was unfortunate, and for Rodney's\r\ncredit should rather be attributed to the force of circumstances than\r\nto choice. It had been better, these say, to have continued along\r\nunder the lee of the French rear, thus inflicting upon it the fire of\r\nthe whole English line, and that the latter should have tacked and\r\ndoubled on the French rear. This argument conveniently forgets that\r\ntacking, or turning round in any way, after a brush of this kind, was\r\npossible to only a part of the ships engaged; and that these would\r\nhave much difficulty in overtaking the enemies who had passed on,\r\nunless the latter were very seriously crippled. Therefore this\r\nsuggested attack, the precise reproduction of the battle of Ushant,\r\nreally reduces itself to the fleets passing on opposite tacks, each\r\ndistributing its fire over the whole of the enemy's line without\r\nattempting any concentration on a part of it. It may, and must, be\r\nconceded at once, that Rodney's change of course permitted the eleven\r\nrear ships of the French (D, r) to run off to leeward, having received\r\nthe fire of only part of their enemy, while the English van had\r\nundergone that of nearly the whole French fleet. These ships, however,\r\nwere thus thrown entirely out of action for a measurable and important\r\ntime by being driven to leeward, and would have been still more out of\r\nposition to help any of their fleet, had not De Grasse himself been\r\nsent to leeward by Hood's division cutting the line three ships ahead\r\nof him. The thirteen leading French ships, obeying the last signal\r\nthey had seen, were hugging the wind; the group of six with De Grasse\r\n(C, e) would have done the same had they not been headed off by Hood's\r\ndivision. The result of Rodney's own action alone, therefore, would\r\nhave been to divide the French fleet into two parts, separated by a\r\nspace of six miles, and one of them hopelessly to leeward. The\r\nEnglish, having gained the wind, would have been in position easily to\r\n\"contain\" the eleven lee ships, and to surround the nineteen weather\r\nones in overwhelming force. The actual condition, owing to the _two_\r\nbreaches in the line, was slightly different; the group of six with De\r\nGrasse being placed between his weather and lee divisions, two miles\r\nfrom the former, four from the latter (D). It seems scarcely necessary\r\nto insist upon the tactical advantages of such a situation for the\r\nEnglish, even disregarding the moral effect of the confusion through\r\nwhich the French had passed. In addition to this, a very striking\r\nlesson is deducible from the immediate effects of the English guns in\r\npassing through. Of the five ships taken, three were those under whose\r\nsterns the English divisions pierced.[212] Instead of giving and\r\ntaking, as the parallel lines ran by, on equal terms, each ship having\r\nthe support of those ahead and astern, the French ships near which the\r\npenetrating columns passed received each the successive fire of all\r\nthe enemy's division. Thus Hood's thirteen ships filed by the two rear\r\nones of the French van, the \"César\" and \"Hector,\" fairly crushing them\r\nunder this concentration of fire; while in like manner, and with like\r\nresults, Rodney's six passed by the \"Glorieux.\" This \"concentration by\r\ndefiling\" past the extremity of a column corresponds quite accurately\r\nto the concentration upon the flank of a line, and has a special\r\ninterest, because if successfully carried out it would be as powerful\r\nan attack now as it ever has been. If quick to seize their advantage,\r\nthe English might have fired upon the ships on both sides of the gaps\r\nthrough which they passed, as the \"Formidable\" actually did; but they\r\nwere using the starboard broadsides, and many doubtless did not\r\nrealize their opportunity until too late. The natural results of\r\nRodney's act, therefore, were: (1) The gain of the wind, with the\r\npower of offensive action; (2) Concentration of fire upon a part of\r\nthe enemy's order; and (3) The introduction into the latter of\r\nconfusion and division, which might, and did, become very great,\r\noffering the opportunity of further tactical advantage. It is not a\r\nvalid reply to say that, had the French been more apt, they could have\r\nunited sooner. A manoeuvre that presents a good chance of advantage\r\ndoes not lose its merit because it can be met by a prompt movement of\r\nthe enemy, any more than a particular lunge of the sword becomes\r\nworthless because it has its appropriate parry. The chances were that\r\nby heading off the rear ships, while the van stood on, the French\r\nfleet would be badly divided; and the move was none the less sagacious\r\nbecause the two fragments could have united sooner than they did, had\r\nthey been well handled. With the alternative action suggested, of\r\ntacking after passing the enemy's rear, the pursuit became a stern\r\nchase, in which both parties having been equally engaged would\r\npresumably be equally crippled. Signals of disability, in fact, were\r\nnumerous in both fleets.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the tactical handling of the two fleets, there were\r\ncertain differences of equipment which conferred tactical advantage,\r\nand are therefore worth noting. The French appear to have had finer\r\nships, and, class for class, heavier armaments. Sir Charles Douglas,\r\nan eminent officer of active and ingenious turn of mind, who paid\r\nparticular attention to gunnery details, estimated that in weight of\r\nbattery the thirty-three French were superior to the thirty-six\r\nEnglish by the force of four 84-gun ships; and that after the loss of\r\nthe \"Zélé,\" \"Jason,\" and \"Caton\" there still remained an advantage\r\nequal to two seventy-fours. The French admiral La Gravière admits the\r\ngenerally heavier calibre of French cannon at this era. The better\r\nconstruction of the French ships and their greater draught caused them\r\nto sail and beat better, and accounts in part for the success of De\r\nGrasse in gaining to windward; for in the afternoon of the 11th only\r\nthree or four of the body of his fleet were visible _from the\r\nmast-head_ of the English flag-ship, which had been within gunshot of\r\nthem on the 9th. It was the awkwardness of the unlucky \"Zélé\" and of\r\nthe \"Magnanime,\" which drew down De Grasse from his position of\r\nvantage, and justified Rodney's perseverance in relying upon the\r\nchapter of accidents to effect his purpose. The greater speed of the\r\nFrench as a body is somewhat hard to account for, because, though\r\nundoubtedly with far better lines, the practice of coppering the\r\nbottom had not become so general in France as in England, and among\r\nthe French there were several uncoppered and worm-eaten ships.[213]\r\nThe better sailing of the French was, however, remarked by the English\r\nofficers, though the great gain mentioned must have been in part owing\r\nto Rodney's lying-by, after the action of the 9th, to refit, due\r\nprobably to the greater injury received by the small body of his\r\nvessels, which had been warmly engaged, with greatly superior numbers.\r\nIt was stated, in narrating that action, that the French kept at half\r\ncannon-range; this was to neutralize a tactical advantage the English\r\nhad in the large number of carronades and other guns of light weight\r\nbut large calibre, which in close action told heavily, but were\r\nuseless at greater distances. The second in command, De Vaudreuil, to\r\nwhom was intrusted the conduct of that attack, expressly states that\r\nif he had come within reach of the carronades his ships would have\r\nbeen quickly unrigged. Whatever judgment is passed upon the military\r\npolicy of refusing to crush an enemy situated as the English division\r\nwas, there can be no question that, if the object was to prevent\r\npursuit, the tactics of De Vaudreuil on the 9th was in all respects\r\nexcellent. He inflicted the utmost injury with the least exposure of\r\nhis own force. On the 12th, De Grasse, by allowing himself to be lured\r\nwithin reach of carronades, yielded this advantage, besides\r\nsacrificing to an impulse his whole previous strategic policy. Rapidly\r\nhandled from their lightness, firing grape and shot of large\r\ndiameter, these guns were peculiarly harmful in close action and\r\nuseless at long range. In a later despatch De Vaudreuil says: \"The\r\neffect of these new arms is most deadly within musket range; it is\r\nthey which so badly crippled us on the 12th of April.\" There were\r\nother gunnery innovations, in some at least of the English ships,\r\nwhich by increasing the accuracy, the rapidity, and the field of fire,\r\ngreatly augmented the power of their batteries. These were the\r\nintroduction of locks, by which the man who aimed also fired; and the\r\nfitting to the gun-carriages of breast-pieces and sweeps, so that the\r\nguns could be pointed farther ahead or astern,--that is, over a larger\r\nfield than had been usual. In fights between single ships, not\r\ncontrolled in their movements by their relations to a fleet, this\r\nimprovement would at times allow the possessor to take a position\r\nwhence he could train upon his enemy without the latter being able to\r\nreply, and some striking instances of such tactical advantage are\r\ngiven. In a fleet fight, such as is now being considered, the gain was\r\nthat the guns could be brought to bear farther forward, and could\r\nfollow the opponent longer as he passed astern, thus doubling, or\r\nmore, the number of shots he might receive, and lessening for him the\r\ninterval of immunity enjoyed between two successive antagonists.[214]\r\nThese matters of antiquated and now obsolete detail carry with them\r\nlessons that are never obsolete; they differ in no respect from the\r\nmore modern experiences with the needle-gun and the torpedo.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed this whole action of April 12, 1782, is fraught with sound\r\nmilitary teaching. Perseverance in pursuit, gaining advantage of\r\nposition, concentration of one's own effort, dispersal of the enemy's\r\nforce, the efficient tactical bearing of small but important\r\nimprovements in the material of war, have been dwelt on. To insist\r\nfurther upon the necessity of not letting slip a chance to beat the\r\nenemy in detail, would be thrown away on any one not already convinced\r\nby the bearing of April 9 on April 12. The abandonment of the attack\r\nupon Jamaica, after the defeat of the French fleet, shows\r\nconclusively that the true way to secure ulterior objects is to defeat\r\nthe force which threatens them. There remains at least one criticism,\r\ndelicate in its character, but essential to draw out the full\r\nteachings of these events; that is, upon the manner in which the\r\nvictory was followed up, and the consequent effects upon the war in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nThe liability of sailing-ships to injury in spars and sails, in other\r\nwords, in that mobility which is the prime characteristic of naval\r\nstrength, makes it difficult to say, after a lapse of time, what might\r\nor might not have been done. It is not only a question of actual\r\ndamage received, which log-books may record, but also of the means for\r\nrepair, the energy and aptitude of the officers and seamen, which\r\ndiffer from ship to ship. As to the ability of the English fleet,\r\nhowever, to follow up its advantages by a more vigorous pursuit on the\r\n12th of April, we have the authority of two most distinguished\r\nofficers,--Sir Samuel Hood, the second in command, and Sir Charles\r\nDouglas, the captain of the fleet, or chief-of-staff to the admiral.\r\nThe former expressed the opinion that twenty ships might have been\r\ntaken, and said so to Rodney the next day; while the chief-of-staff\r\nwas so much mortified by the failure, and by the manner in which the\r\nadmiral received his suggestions, as seriously to contemplate\r\nresigning his position.[215]\r\n\r\nAdvice and criticism are easy, nor can the full weight of a\r\nresponsibility be felt, except by the man on whom it is laid; but\r\ngreat results cannot often be reached in war without risk and effort.\r\nThe accuracy of the judgment of these two officers, however, is\r\nconfirmed by inference from the French reports. Rodney justifies his\r\nfailure to pursue by alleging the crippled condition of many ships,\r\nand other matters incident to the conclusion of a hard-fought battle,\r\nand then goes on to suggest what might have been done that night, had\r\nhe pursued, by the French fleet, which \"went off in a body of\r\ntwenty-six ships-of-the-line.\"[216] These possibilities are rather\r\ncreditable to his imagination, considering what the French fleet had\r\ndone by day; but as regards the body of twenty-six[217] ships, De\r\nVaudreuil, who, after De Grasse's surrender, made the signal for the\r\nships to rally round his flag, found only ten with him next morning,\r\nand was not joined by any more before the 14th. During the following\r\ndays five more joined him at intervals.[218] With these he went to the\r\nrendezvous at Cap Français, where he found others, bringing the whole\r\nnumber who repaired thither to twenty. The five remaining, of those\r\nthat had been in the action, fled to Curaçoa, six hundred miles\r\ndistant, and did not rejoin until May. The \"body of twenty-six ships,\"\r\ntherefore, had no existence in fact; on the contrary, the French fleet\r\nwas very badly broken up, and several of its ships isolated. As\r\nregards the crippled condition, there seems no reason to think the\r\nEnglish had suffered more, but rather less, than their enemy; and a\r\ncurious statement, bearing upon this, appears in a letter from Sir\r\nGilbert Blane:--\r\n\r\n    \"It was with difficulty we could make the French officers\r\n    believe that the returns of killed and wounded, made by our\r\n    ships to the admiral, were true; and one of them flatly\r\n    contradicted me, saying we always gave the world a false account\r\n    of our loss. I then walked with him over the decks of the\r\n    'Formidable,' and bid him remark what number of shot-holes there\r\n    were, and _also how little her rigging had suffered_, and asked\r\n    if that degree of damage was likely to be connected with the\r\n    loss of more than fourteen men, which was our number killed, and\r\n    _the greatest of any in the fleet_, except the 'Royal Oak' and\r\n    'Monarch.' He ... owned our fire must have been much better kept\r\n    up and directed than theirs.\"[219]\r\n\r\nThere can remain little doubt, therefore, that the advantage was not\r\nfollowed up with all possible vigor. Not till five days after the\r\nbattle was Hood's division sent toward San Domingo, where they picked\r\nup in the Mona Passage the \"Jason\" and the \"Caton,\" which had\r\nseparated before the battle and were on their way to Cap Français.\r\nThese, and two small vessels with them, were the sole after-fruits of\r\nthe victory. Under the conditions of England's war this cautious\r\nfailure is a serious blot on Rodney's military reputation, and goes\r\nfar to fix his place among successful admirals. He had saved Jamaica\r\nfor the time; but he had not, having the opportunity, crushed the\r\nFrench fleet. He too, like De Grasse, had allowed the immediate\r\nobjective to blind him to the general military situation, and to the\r\nfactor which controlled it.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the consequences of this neglect, and the real\r\nindecisiveness of this celebrated battle, we must go forward a year\r\nand listen to the debates in Parliament on the conditions of peace, in\r\nFebruary, 1783. The approval or censure of the terms negotiated by the\r\nexisting ministry involved the discussion of many considerations; but\r\nthe gist of the dispute was, whether the conditions were such as the\r\ncomparative financial and military situations of the belligerents\r\njustified, or whether it would have been better for England to\r\ncontinue the war rather than submit to the sacrifices she had made. As\r\nregards the financial condition, despite the gloomy picture drawn by\r\nthe advocates of the peace, there was probably no more doubt then than\r\nthere is now about the comparative resources of the different\r\ncountries. The question of military strength was really that of naval\r\npower. The ministry argued that the whole British force hardly\r\nnumbered one hundred sail-of-the-line, while the navies of France and\r\nSpain amounted to one hundred and forty, not to speak of that of\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\n    \"With so glaring an inferiority, what hopes of success could we\r\n    derive, either from the experience of the last campaign, or from\r\n    any new distribution of our force in that which would have\r\n    followed? In the West Indies we could not have had more than\r\n    forty-six sail to oppose to forty, which on the day that peace\r\n    was signed lay in Cadiz Bay, with sixteen thousand troops on\r\n    board, ready to sail for that quarter of the world, where they\r\n    would have been joined by twelve of the line from Havana and\r\n    ten from San Domingo.... Might we not too reasonably apprehend\r\n    that the campaign in the West Indies would have closed with the\r\n    loss of Jamaica itself, the avowed object of this immense\r\n    armament?\"[220]\r\n\r\nThese are certainly the reasonings of an avowed partisan, for which\r\nlarge allowances must be made. The accuracy of the statement of\r\ncomparative numbers was denied by Lord Keppel, a member of the same\r\nparty, and but lately at the head of the admiralty, a post which he\r\nhad resigned because he disapproved the treaty.[221] English\r\nstatesmen, too, as well as English seamen, must by this time have\r\nlearned to discount largely the apparent, when estimating the real,\r\npower of the other navies. Nevertheless, how different would have been\r\nthe appreciation of the situation, both moral and material, had Rodney\r\nreaped the full fruits of the victory which he owed rather to chance\r\nthan to his own merit, great as that undeniably was.\r\n\r\nA letter published in 1809, anonymous, but bearing strong internal\r\nevidence of being written by Sir Gilbert Blane, the physician of the\r\nfleet and long on intimate terms with Rodney, who was a constant\r\nsufferer during his last cruise, states that the admiral \"thought\r\nlittle of his victory on the 12th of April, 1782.\" He would have\r\npreferred to rest his reputation upon his combinations against De\r\nGuichen, April 17, 1780, and \"looked upon that opportunity of beating,\r\nwith an inferior fleet, such an officer, whom he considered the best\r\nin the French service, as one by which, but for the disobedience of\r\nhis captains, he might have gained immortal renown.\"[222] Few students\r\nwill be inclined to question this estimate of Rodney's merit on the\r\ntwo occasions. Fortune, however, decreed that his glory should depend\r\nupon a battle, brilliant in itself, to which his own qualities least\r\ncontributed, and denied him success when he most deserved it. The\r\nchief action of his life in which merit and success met, the\r\ndestruction of Langara's fleet off Cape St. Vincent, has almost\r\npassed into oblivion; yet it called for the highest qualities of a\r\nseaman, and is not unworthy of comparison with Hawke's pursuit of\r\nConflans.[223]\r\n\r\nWithin the two years and a half which had elapsed since Rodney was\r\nappointed to his command he had gained several important successes,\r\nand, as was remarked, had taken a French, a Spanish, and a Dutch\r\nadmiral. \"In that time he had added twelve line-of-battle ships, all\r\ntaken from the enemy, to the British navy, and destroyed five more;\r\nand to render the whole still more singularly remarkable, the 'Ville\r\nde Paris' was said to be the only first-rate man-of-war that ever was\r\ntaken and carried into port by any commander of any nation.\"\r\nNotwithstanding his services, the party spirit that was then so strong\r\nin England, penetrating even the army and navy, obtained his\r\nrecall[224] upon the fall of Lord North's ministry, and his successor,\r\na man unknown to fame, had already sailed when news arrived of the\r\nvictory. In the fallen and discouraging state of English affairs at\r\nthe time, it excited the utmost exultation, and silenced the\r\nstrictures which certain parts of the admiral's previous conduct had\r\ndrawn forth. The people were not in a humor to be critical, and amid\r\nthe exaggerated notions that prevailed of the results achieved, no one\r\nthought of the failure to obtain greater. This impression long\r\nprevailed. As late as 1830, when Rodney's Life was first published, it\r\nwas asserted \"that the French navy had been so effectually crippled\r\nand reduced by the decisive victory of the 12th of April, as to be no\r\nlonger in a condition to contest with Great Britain the empire of the\r\nseas.\" This is nonsense, excusable in 1782, but not to the calm\r\nthought of after days. The favorable terms obtained were due to the\r\nfinancial embarrassment of France, not to her naval humiliation; and\r\nif there was exaggeration in the contention of the advocates of peace\r\nthat England could not save Jamaica, it is probable that she could not\r\nhave recovered by arms the other islands restored to her by the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nThe memory of De Grasse will always be associated with great services\r\ndone to America. His name, rather than that of Rochambeau, represents\r\nthe material succor which France gave to the struggling life of the\r\nyoung Republic, as Lafayette's recalls the moral sympathy so\r\nopportunely extended. The incidents of his life, subsequent to the\r\ngreat disaster which closed his active career, cannot be without\r\ninterest to American readers.\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of the \"Ville de Paris,\" De Grasse accompanied the\r\nEnglish fleet and its prizes to Jamaica, whither Rodney repaired to\r\nrefit his ships, thus appearing as a captive upon the scene of his\r\nintended conquest. On the 19th of May he left the island, still a\r\nprisoner, for England. Both by naval officers and by the English\r\npeople he was treated with that flattering and benevolent attention\r\nwhich comes easily from the victor to the vanquished, and of which his\r\npersonal valor at least was not unworthy. It is said that he did not\r\nrefuse to show himself on several occasions upon the balcony of his\r\nrooms in London, to the populace shouting for the valiant Frenchman.\r\nThis undignified failure to appreciate his true position naturally\r\nexcited the indignation of his countrymen; the more so as he had been\r\nunsparing and excessive in denouncing the conduct of his subordinates\r\non the unlucky 12th of April.\r\n\r\n    \"He bears his misfortune,\" wrote Sir Gilbert Blane, \"with\r\n    equanimity; conscious, as he says, that he has done his duty....\r\n    He attributes his misfortune, not to the inferiority of his\r\n    force, but to the base desertion of his officers in the other\r\n    ships, to whom he made the signal to rally, and even hailed them\r\n    to abide by him, but was abandoned.\"[225]\r\n\r\nThis was the key-note to all his utterances. Writing from the English\r\nflag-ship, the day after the battle, he \"threw upon the greater part\r\nof his captains the misfortunes of the day. Some had disobeyed his\r\nsignals; others, and notably the captains of the 'Languedoc' and\r\n'Couronne,' that is to say his next ahead and astern, had abandoned\r\nhim.\"[226] He did not, however, confine himself to official reports,\r\nbut while a prisoner in London published several pamphlets to the same\r\neffect, which he sent broadcast over Europe. The government, naturally\r\nthinking that an officer could not thus sully the honor of his corps\r\nwithout good reason, resolved to search out and relentlessly punish\r\nall the guilty. The captains of the \"Languedoc\" and \"Couronne\" were\r\nimprisoned as soon as they reached France, and all papers, logs, etc.,\r\nbearing upon the case were gathered together. Under all the\r\ncircumstances it is not to be wondered at that on his return to\r\nFrance, De Grasse, to use his own words, \"found no one to hold out a\r\nhand to him.\"[227] It was not till the beginning of 1784 that all the\r\naccused and witnesses were ready to appear before the court-martial;\r\nbut the result of the trial was to clear entirely and in the most\r\nample manner almost every one whom he had attacked, while the faults\r\nfound were considered of a character entitled to indulgence, and were\r\nawarded but slight punishment. \"Nevertheless,\" cautiously observes a\r\nFrench writer, \"one cannot but say, with the Court, that the capture\r\nof an admiral commanding thirty ships-of-the-line is an historical\r\nincident which causes the regret of the whole nation.\"[228] As to the\r\nconduct of the battle by the admiral, the Court found that the danger\r\nof the \"Zélé\" on the morning of the 12th was not such as to justify\r\nbearing down for so long a time as was done; that the crippled ship\r\nhad a breeze which was not then shared by the English, five miles away\r\nto the southward, and which carried her into Basse Terre at ten A.M.;\r\nthat the engagement should not have been begun before all the ships\r\nhad come into line; and finally, that the fleet should have been\r\nformed on the same tack as the English, because, by continuing to\r\nstand south, it entered the zone of calms and light airs at the north\r\nend of Dominica.[229]\r\n\r\nDe Grasse was much dissatisfied with the finding of the Court, and was\r\nindiscreet enough to write to the minister of marine, protesting\r\nagainst it and demanding a new trial. The minister, acknowledging his\r\nprotest, replied in the name of the king. After commenting upon the\r\npamphlets that had been so widely issued, and the entire contradiction\r\nof their statements by the testimony before the Court, he concluded\r\nwith these weighty words:--\r\n\r\n    \"The loss of the battle cannot be attributed to the fault of\r\n    private officers.[230] It results, from the findings, that you\r\n    have allowed yourself to injure, by ill-founded accusations, the\r\n    reputation of several officers, in order to clear yourself in\r\n    public opinion of an unhappy result, the excuse for which you\r\n    might perhaps have found in the inferiority of your force, in\r\n    the uncertain fortune of war, and in circumstances over which\r\n    you had no control. His Majesty is willing to believe that you\r\n    did what you could to prevent the misfortunes of the day; but he\r\n    cannot be equally indulgent to your unjust imputations upon\r\n    those officers of his navy who have been cleared of the charges\r\n    against them. His Majesty, dissatisfied with your conduct in\r\n    this respect, forbids you to present yourself before him. I\r\n    transmit his orders with regret, and add my own advice to\r\n    retire, under the circumstances, to your province.\"\r\n\r\nDe Grasse died in January, 1788. His fortunate opponent, rewarded with\r\npeerage and pension, lived until 1792. Hood was also created a peer,\r\nand commanded with distinction in the early part of the wars of the\r\nFrench Revolution, winning the enthusiastic admiration of Nelson, who\r\nserved under him; but a sharp difference with the admiralty caused him\r\nto be retired before achieving any brilliant addition to his\r\nreputation. He died in 1816, at the great age of ninety-two.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[194] The curve, a, a', a'', represents the line which Hood proposed\r\nto follow with his fleet, the wind being supposed east-southeast. The\r\npositions B, B, B, refer to the proceedings of a subsequent day and\r\nhave nothing to do with the diagram at A.\r\n\r\n[195] When a fleet is in line ahead, close to the wind, on one tack,\r\nand the ships go about together, they will, on the other tack, be on\r\nthe same line, but not one ahead of the other. This formation was\r\ncalled bow-and-quarter line.\r\n\r\n[196] A spring is a rope taken from the stern or quarter of a ship at\r\nanchor, to an anchor properly placed, by which means the ship can be\r\nturned in a desired direction.\r\n\r\n[197] In the council of war of the allied fleets on the expediency of\r\nattacking the English squadron anchored at Torbay (p. 408) an opponent\r\nof the measure urged \"that the whole of the combined fleets could not\r\nbear down upon the English in a line-of-battle abreast, that of course\r\nthey must form the line-of-battle ahead, and go down upon the enemy\r\nsingly, by which they would run the greatest risk of being shattered\r\nand torn to pieces,\" etc. (Beatson, vol. v. p. 396).\r\n\r\n[198] In war, as in cards, the state of the score must at times\r\ndictate the play; and the chief who never takes into consideration the\r\neffect which his particular action will have on the general result,\r\nnor what is demanded of him by the condition of things elsewhere, both\r\npolitical and military, lacks an essential quality of a great general.\r\n\"The audacious manner in which Wellington stormed the redoubt of\r\nFrancisco [at Ciudad Rodrigo], and broke ground on the first night of\r\nthe investment, the more audacious manner in which he assaulted the\r\nplace before the fire of the defence had in any way lessened, and\r\nbefore the counterscarp had been blown in, were the true causes of the\r\nsudden fall of the place. _Both the military and political state of\r\naffairs warranted this neglect of rules._ When the general terminated\r\nhis order for the assault with this sentence, 'Ciudad Rodrigo _must_\r\nbe stormed this evening,' he knew well that it would be nobly\r\nunderstood\" (Napier's Peninsular War). \"Judging that the honour of his\r\nMajesty's arms, _and the circumstances of the war in these seas_,\r\nrequired a considerable degree of enterprise, I felt myself justified\r\nin departing from the regular system\" (Sir John Jervis's Report of the\r\nBattle of Cape St. Vincent).\r\n\r\n[199] By Kempenfeldt's attack upon De Guichen's convoy, and the\r\nfollowing gale in December, 1781.

Thomas White, also of the British Navy, who were eye-witnesses,\r\nboth being checked by French and other English narratives. Matthews\r\nand White are at variance with Rodney's official report as to the tack\r\non which the English were at daybreak; but the latter is explicitly\r\nconfirmed by private letters of Sir Charles Douglas, sent immediately\r\nafter the battle to prominent persons, and is followed in the text.\r\n\r\n[207] Letter of Sir Charles Douglas, Rodney's chief-of-staff: \"United\r\nService Journal,\" 1833, Part I. p. 515.\r\n\r\n[208] De Grasse calls this distance three leagues, while some of his\r\ncaptains estimated it to be as great as five.\r\n\r\n[209] The French, in mid-channel, had the wind more to the eastward.\r\n\r\n[210] The positions of the French ships captured are shown by a cross\r\nin each of the three successive stages of the battle, B, C, D.\r\n\r\n[211] The distance of the weathermost French ships from the \"Ville de\r\nParis,\" when the signal to form line-of-battle was made, is variously\r\nstated at from six to nine miles.\r\n\r\n[212] The other two French ships taken were the \"Ville de Paris,\"\r\nwhich, in her isolated condition, and bearing the flag of the\r\ncommander-in-chief, became the quarry around which the enemy's ships\r\nnaturally gathered, and the \"Ardent,\" of sixty-four guns, which\r\nappears to have been intercepted in a gallant attempt to pass from the\r\nvan to the side of her admiral in his extremity.

After some discussion between the admiral and captain,\r\nat which I was present, the admiral being confined with the gout, it\r\nwas decided to persist in the same course with the signal to engage to\r\nleeward.\" (United Service Journal, 1830, Part II. p. 479.)\r\n\r\n[224] Rodney was a strong Tory.

It was purely a maritime war. Not only did the\r\nallied kingdoms carefully refrain from continental entanglements,\r\nwhich England in accordance with her former policy strove to excite,\r\nbut there was between the two contestants an approach to equality on\r\nthe sea which had not been realized since the days of Tourville. The\r\npoints in dispute, the objects for which the war was undertaken or at\r\nwhich it aimed, were for the most part remote from Europe; and none of\r\nthem was on the continent with the single exception of Gibraltar, the\r\nstrife over which, being at the extreme point of a rugged and\r\ndifficult salient, and separated from neutral nations by the whole of\r\nFrance and Spain, never threatened to drag in other parties than those\r\nimmediately interested.\r\n\r\nNo such conditions existed in any war between the accession of Louis\r\nXIV. and the downfall of Napoleon. There was a period during the reign\r\nof the former in which the French navy was superior in number and\r\nequipment to the English and Dutch; but the policy and ambition of the\r\nsovereign was always directed to continental extension, and his naval\r\npower, resting on inadequate foundations, was ephemeral. During the\r\nfirst three-quarters of the eighteenth century there was practically\r\nno check to the sea power of England; great as were its effects upon\r\nthe issues of the day, the absence of a capable rival made its\r\noperations barren of military lessons. In the later wars of the French\r\nRepublic and Empire, the apparent equality in numbers of ships and\r\nweight of batteries was illusive, owing to the demoralization of the\r\nFrench officers and seamen by causes upon which it is not necessary\r\nhere to enlarge. After some years of courageous but impotent effort,\r\nthe tremendous disaster of Trafalgar proclaimed to the world the\r\nprofessional inefficiency of the French and Spanish navies, already\r\ndetected by the keen eyes of Nelson and his brother officers, and upon\r\nwhich rested the contemptuous confidence that characterized his\r\nattitude, and to some extent his tactics, toward them. Thenceforward\r\nthe emperor \"turned his eyes from the only field of battle where\r\nfortune had been unfaithful to him, and deciding to pursue England\r\nelsewhere than upon the seas, undertook to restore his navy, but\r\nwithout reserving to it any share in a strife become more than ever\r\nfurious.... Up to the last day of the Empire he refused to offer to\r\nthis restored navy, full of ardor and confidence, the opportunity to\r\nmeasure itself with the enemy.\"[231] Great Britain resumed her old\r\nposition as unquestioned mistress of the seas.\r\n\r\nThe student of naval war will therefore expect to find a particular\r\ninterest in the plans and methods of the parties to this great\r\ncontest, and especially where they concern the general conduct of the\r\nwhole war, or of certain large and clearly defined portions of it; in\r\nthe strategic purpose which gave, or should have given, continuity to\r\ntheir actions from first to last, and in the strategic movements which\r\naffected for good or ill the fortunes of the more limited periods,\r\nwhich may be called naval campaigns. For while it cannot be conceded\r\nthat the particular battles are, even at this day, wholly devoid of\r\ntactical instruction, which it has been one of the aims of the\r\npreceding pages to elicit, it is undoubtedly true that, like all the\r\ntactical systems of history, they have had their day, and their\r\npresent usefulness to the student is rather in the mental training, in\r\nthe forming of correct tactical habits of thought, than in supplying\r\nmodels for close imitation. On the other hand, the movements which\r\nprecede and prepare for great battles, or which, by their skilful and\r\nenergetic combinations, attain great ends without the actual contact\r\nof arms, depend upon factors more permanent than the weapons of the\r\nage, and therefore furnish principles of more enduring value.\r\n\r\nIn a war undertaken for any object, even if that object be the\r\npossession of a particular territory or position, an attack directly\r\nupon the place coveted may not be, from the military point of view,\r\nthe best means of obtaining it. The end upon which the military\r\noperations are directed may therefore be other than the object which\r\nthe belligerent government wishes to obtain, and it has received a\r\nname of its own,--the objective. In the critical consideration of any\r\nwar it is necessary, first, to put clearly before the student's eye\r\nthe objects desired by each belligerent; then, to consider whether the\r\nobjective chosen is the most likely, in case of success, to compass\r\nthose objects; and finally, to study the merits or faults of the\r\nvarious movements by which the objective is approached. The minuteness\r\nwith which such an examination is conducted will depend upon the\r\nextent of the work which the inquirer proposes to himself; but it will\r\ngenerally conduce to clearness if an outline, giving only the main\r\nfeatures unencumbered by detail, should precede a more exhaustive\r\ndiscussion. When such principal lines are thoroughly grasped, details\r\nare easily referred to them, and fall into place. The effort here will\r\nbe confined to presenting such an outline, as being alone fitted to\r\nthe scope of this work.\r\n\r\nThe principal parties to the War of 1778 were, on the one hand, Great\r\nBritain; on the other, the House of Bourbon, controlling the two great\r\nkingdoms of France and Spain. The American colonies, being already\r\nengaged in an unequal struggle with the mother-country, gladly\r\nwelcomed an event so important to them; while in 1780 Holland was\r\ndeliberately forced by England into a war from which she had nothing\r\nto gain and all to lose. The object of the Americans was perfectly\r\nsimple,--to rid their country out of the hands of the English. Their\r\npoverty and their lack of military sea power, with the exception of a\r\nfew cruisers that preyed upon the enemy's commerce, necessarily\r\nconfined their efforts to land warfare, which constituted indeed a\r\npowerful diversion in favor of the allies and an exhausting drain upon\r\nthe resources of Great Britain, but which it was in the power of the\r\nlatter to stop at once by abandoning the contest. Holland, on the\r\nother hand, being safe from invasion by land, showed little desire for\r\nanything more than to escape with as little external loss as possible,\r\nthrough the assistance of the allied navies. The object of these two\r\nminor parties may therefore be said to have been the cessation of the\r\nwar; whereas the principals hoped from its continuance certain changed\r\nconditions, which constituted their objects.\r\n\r\nWith Great Britain also the object of the war was very simple. Having\r\nbeen led into a lamentable altercation with her most promising\r\ncolonies, the quarrel had gone on step by step till she was threatened\r\nwith their loss. To maintain forcible control when willing adhesion\r\nhad departed, she had taken up arms against them, and her object in so\r\ndoing was to prevent a break in those foreign possessions with which,\r\nin the eyes of that generation, her greatness was indissolubly\r\nconnected. The appearance of France and Spain as active supporters of\r\nthe colonists' cause made no change in England's objects, whatever\r\nchange of objective her military plans may, or should, have undergone.\r\nThe danger of losing the continental colonies was vastly increased by\r\nthese accessions to the ranks of her enemies, which brought with them\r\nalso a threat of loss, soon to be realized in part, of other valuable\r\nforeign possessions. England, in short, as regards the objects of the\r\nwar, was strictly on the defensive; she feared losing much, and at\r\nbest only hoped to keep what she had. By forcing Holland into war,\r\nhowever, she obtained a military advantage; for, without increasing\r\nthe strength of her opponents, several important but ill-defended\r\nmilitary and commercial positions were thereby laid open to her arms.\r\n\r\nThe views and objects of France and Spain were more complex. The moral\r\nincentives of hereditary enmity and desire of revenge for the recent\r\npast doubtless weighed strongly, as in France did also the sympathy\r\nof the _salons_ and philosophers with the colonists' struggle for\r\nfreedom; but powerfully as sentimental considerations affect the\r\naction of nations, only the tangible means by which it is expected to\r\ngratify them admit of statement and measurement. France might wish to\r\nregain her North American possessions; but the then living generation\r\nof colonists had too keen personal recollection of the old contests to\r\nacquiesce in any such wishes as to Canada. The strong inherited\r\ndistrust of the French, which characterized the Americans of the\r\nrevolutionary era, has been too much overlooked in the glow of\r\ngratitude which followed the effectual sympathy and assistance then\r\ngiven; but it was understood at the time, and France felt, that to\r\nrenew those pretensions might promote, between people of the same race\r\nonly recently alienated, a reconciliation by just concessions, which a\r\nstrong and high-minded party of Englishmen had never ceased to\r\nadvocate. She therefore did not avow, perhaps did not entertain, this\r\nobject. On the contrary, she formally renounced all claim to any part\r\nof the continent which was then, or had recently been, under the power\r\nof the British crown, but stipulated for freedom of action in\r\nconquering and retaining any of the West India Islands, while all the\r\nother colonies of Great Britain were, of course, open to her attack.\r\nThe principal objects at which France aimed were therefore the English\r\nWest Indies and that control of India which had passed into English\r\nhands, and also to secure in due time the independence of the United\r\nStates, after they had wrought a sufficient diversion in her favor.\r\nWith the policy of exclusive trade which characterized that\r\ngeneration, the loss of these important possessions was expected to\r\nlessen that commercial greatness upon which the prosperity of England\r\ndepended,--to weaken her and to strengthen France. In fact, the strife\r\nwhich should be greater may be said to have been the animating motive\r\nof France; all objects were summed up in the one supreme end to which\r\nthey contributed,--maritime and political superiority over England.\r\n\r\nPreponderance over England, in combination with France, was also the\r\naim of the equally humbled but less vigorous kingdom of Spain; but\r\nthere was a definiteness in the injuries suffered and the objects\r\nspecially sought by her which is less easily found in the broader\r\nviews of her ally. Although no Spaniard then living could remember the\r\nSpanish flag flying over Minorca, Gibraltar, or Jamaica, the lapse of\r\ntime had not reconciled the proud and tenacious nation to their loss;\r\nnor was there on the part of the Americans the same traditional\r\nobjection to the renewal of Spanish sovereignty over the two Floridas\r\nthat was felt with reference to Canada.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the objects sought by the two nations, whose\r\ninterposition changed the whole character of the American\r\nRevolutionary War. It is needless to say that they did not all appear\r\namong the causes, or pretexts, avowed for engaging in hostility; but\r\nsagacious English opinion of the day rightly noted, as embodying in a\r\nfew words the real ground of action of the united Bourbon Courts, the\r\nfollowing phrase in the French manifesto: \"To avenge their respective\r\ninjuries, and to put an end to that tyrannical empire which England\r\nhas usurped, and claims to maintain upon the ocean.\" In short, as\r\nregards the _objects_ of the war the allies were on the offensive, as\r\nEngland was thrown upon the defensive.\r\n\r\nThe tyrannical empire which England was thus accused, and not\r\nunjustly, of exercising over the seas, rested upon her great sea\r\npower, actual or latent; upon her commerce and armed shipping, her\r\ncommercial establishments, colonies, and naval stations in all parts\r\nof the world. Up to this time her scattered colonies had been bound to\r\nher by ties of affectionate sentiment, and by the still stronger\r\nmotive of self-interest through the close commercial connection with\r\nthe mother-country and the protection afforded by the constant\r\npresence of her superior navy. Now a break was made in the girdle of\r\nstrong ports upon which her naval power was based, by the revolt of\r\nthe continental colonies; while the numerous trade interests between\r\nthem and the West Indies, which were injured by the consequent\r\nhostilities, tended to divide the sympathies of the islands also. The\r\nstruggle was not only for political possession and commercial use. It\r\ninvolved a military question of the first importance,--whether a chain\r\nof naval stations covering one of the shores of the Atlantic, linking\r\nCanada and Halifax with the West Indies, and backed by a thriving\r\nseafaring population, should remain in the hands of a nation which had\r\nso far used its unprecedented sea power with consistent, resolute\r\naggressiveness, and with almost unbroken success.\r\n\r\nWhile Great Britain was thus embarrassed by the difficulty of\r\nmaintaining her hold upon her naval bases, which were the defensive\r\nelement of her naval strength, her offensive naval power, her fleet,\r\nwas threatened by the growth of the armed shipping of France and\r\nSpain, which now confronted her upon the field which she had claimed\r\nas her own, with an organized military force of equal or superior\r\nmaterial strength. The moment was therefore favorable for attacking\r\nthe great Power whose wealth, reaped from the sea, had been a decisive\r\nfactor in the European wars of the past century. The next question was\r\nthe selection of the points of attack--of the principal _objectives_\r\nupon which the main effort of the assailants should be steadily\r\ndirected, and of the secondary objectives by which the defence should\r\nbe distracted and its strength dissipated.\r\n\r\nOne of the wisest French statesmen of that day, Turgot, held that it\r\nwas to the interest of France that the colonies should not achieve\r\ntheir independence. If subdued by exhaustion, their strength was lost\r\nto England; if reduced by a military tenure of controlling points, but\r\nnot exhausted, the necessity of constant repression would be a\r\ncontinual weakness to the mother-country. Though this opinion did not\r\nprevail in the councils of the French government, which wished the\r\nultimate independence of America, it contained elements of truth which\r\neffectually moulded the policy of the war. If benefit to the United\r\nStates, by effecting their deliverance, were the principal object, the\r\ncontinent became the natural scene, and its decisive military points\r\nthe chief objectives, of operations; but as the first object of France\r\nwas not to benefit America, but to injure England, sound military\r\njudgment dictated that the continental strife, so far from being\r\nhelped to a conclusion, should be kept in vigorous life. It was a\r\ndiversion ready made to the hand of France and exhausting to Great\r\nBritain, requiring only so much support as would sustain a resistance\r\nto which the insurgents were bound by the most desperate alternatives.\r\nThe territory of the thirteen colonies therefore should not be the\r\nprincipal objective of France; much less that of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe commercial value of the English West Indies made them tempting\r\nobjects to the French, who adapted themselves with peculiar readiness\r\nto the social conditions of that region, in which their colonial\r\npossessions were already extensive. Besides the two finest of the\r\nLesser Antilles, Guadeloupe and Martinique, which she still retains,\r\nFrance then held Sta. Lucia and the western half of Hayti. She might\r\nwell hope by successful war to add most of the English Antilles, and\r\nthus to round off a truly imperial tropical dependency; while, though\r\ndebarred from Jamaica by the susceptibilities of Spain, it might be\r\npossible to win back that magnificent island for an allied and weaker\r\nnation. But however desirable as possessions, and therefore as\r\nobjects, the smaller Antilles might be, their military tenure depended\r\ntoo entirely upon control of the sea for them to be in themselves\r\nproper objectives. The French government, therefore, forbade its naval\r\ncommanders to occupy such as they might seize. They were to make the\r\ngarrisons prisoners, destroy the defences, and so retire. In the\r\nexcellent military port of Fort Royal, Martinique, in Cap Français,\r\nand in the strong allied harbor of Havana, a fleet of adequate size\r\nfound good, secure, and well-distributed bases; while the early and\r\nserious loss of Sta. Lucia must be attributed to the mismanagement of\r\nthe French fleet and the professional ability of the English admiral.\r\nOn shore, in the West Indies, the rival powers therefore found\r\nthemselves about equally provided with the necessary points of\r\nsupport; mere occupation of others could not add to their military\r\nstrength, thenceforth dependent upon the numbers and quality of the\r\nfleets. To extend occupation further with safety, the first need was\r\nto obtain maritime supremacy, not only locally, but over the general\r\nfield of war. Otherwise occupation was precarious, unless enforced by\r\na body of troops so large as to entail expense beyond the worth of the\r\nobject. The key of the situation in the West Indies being thus in the\r\nfleets, these became the true objectives of the military effort; and\r\nall the more so because the real _military_ usefulness of the West\r\nIndian ports in this war was as an intermediate base, between Europe\r\nand the American continent, to which the fleets retired when the\r\narmies went into winter quarters. No sound strategic operation on\r\nshore was undertaken in the West Indies except the seizure of Sta.\r\nLucia by the English, and the abortive plan against Jamaica in 1782;\r\nnor was any serious attempt against a military port, as Barbadoes or\r\nFort Royal, possible, until naval preponderance was assured either by\r\nbattle or by happy concentration of force. The key of the situation,\r\nit must be repeated, was in the fleet.\r\n\r\nThe influence of naval power, of an armed fleet, upon the war on the\r\nAmerican continent has also been indicated in the opinions of\r\nWashington and Sir Henry Clinton; while the situation in the East\r\nIndies, regarded as a field by itself, has been so largely discussed\r\nunder the head of Suffren's campaign, that it needs here only to\r\nrepeat that everything there depended upon control of the sea by a\r\nsuperior naval force. The capture of Trincomalee, essential as it was\r\nto the French squadron which had no other base, was, like that of Sta.\r\nLucia, a surprise, and could only have been effected by the defeat,\r\nor, as happened, by the absence of the enemy's fleet. In North America\r\nand India sound military policy pointed out, as the true objective,\r\nthe enemy's fleet, upon which also depended the communications with\r\nthe mother-countries. There remains Europe, which it is scarcely\r\nprofitable to examine at length as a separate field of action, because\r\nits relations to the universal war are so much more important. It may\r\nsimply be pointed out that the only two points in Europe whose\r\npolitical transfer was an object of the war were Gibraltar and\r\nMinorca; the former of which was throughout, by the urgency of Spain,\r\nmade a principal objective of the allies. The tenure of both these\r\ndepended, obviously, upon control of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn a sea war, as in all others, two things are from the first\r\nessential,--a suitable base upon the frontier, in this case the\r\nseaboard, from which the operations start, and an organized military\r\nforce, in this case a fleet, of size and quality adequate to the\r\nproposed operations. If the war, as in the present instance, extends\r\nto distant parts of the globe, there will be needed in each of those\r\ndistant regions secure ports for the shipping, to serve as secondary,\r\nor contingent, bases of the local war. Between these secondary and the\r\nprincipal, or home, bases there must be reasonably secure\r\ncommunication, which will depend upon military control of the\r\nintervening sea. This control must be exercised by the navy, which\r\nwill enforce it either by clearing the sea in all directions of\r\nhostile cruisers, thus allowing the ships of its own nation to pass\r\nwith reasonable security, or by accompanying in force (convoying) each\r\ntrain of supply-ships necessary for the support of the distant\r\noperations. The former method aims at a widely diffused effort of the\r\nnational power, the other at a concentration of it upon that part of\r\nthe sea where the convoy is at a given moment. Whichever be adopted,\r\nthe communications will doubtless be strengthened by the military\r\nholding of good harbors, properly spaced yet not too numerous, along\r\nthe routes,--as, for instance, the Cape of Good Hope and the\r\nMauritius. Stations of this kind have always been necessary, but are\r\ndoubly so now, as fuel needs renewing more frequently than did the\r\nprovisions and supplies in former days. These combinations of strong\r\npoints at home and abroad, and the condition of the communications\r\nbetween them, may be called the strategic features of the general\r\nmilitary situation, by which, and by the relative strength of the\r\nopposing fleets, the nature of the operations must be determined. In\r\neach of the three divisions of the field, Europe, America, and India,\r\nunder which for sake of clearness the narrative has been given, the\r\ncontrol of the sea has been insisted upon as the determining factor,\r\nand the hostile fleet therefore indicated as the true objective. Let\r\nthe foregoing considerations now be applied to the whole field of\r\nwar, and see how far the same conclusion holds good of it, and if so,\r\nwhat should have been the nature of the operations on either\r\nside.[232]\r\n\r\nIn Europe the home base of Great Britain was on the English Channel,\r\nwith the two principal arsenals of Plymouth and Portsmouth. The base\r\nof the allied powers was on the Atlantic, the principal military ports\r\nbeing Brest, Ferrol, and Cadiz. Behind these, within the\r\nMediterranean, were the dock-yards of Toulon and Cartagena, over\r\nagainst which stood the English station Port Mahon, in Minorca. The\r\nlatter, however, may be left wholly out of account, being confined to\r\na defensive part during the war, as the British fleet was not able to\r\nspare any squadron to the Mediterranean. Gibraltar, on the contrary,\r\nby its position, effectually watched over detachments or\r\nreinforcements from within the Straits, provided it were utilized as\r\nthe station of a body of ships adequate to the duty. This was not\r\ndone; the British European fleet being kept tied to the Channel, that\r\nis, to home defence, and making infrequent visits to the Rock to\r\nconvoy supplies essential to the endurance of the garrison. There was,\r\nhowever, a difference in the parts played by Port Mahon and Gibraltar.\r\nThe former, being at the time wholly unimportant, received no\r\nattention from the allies until late in the war, when it fell after a\r\nsix months' siege; whereas the latter, being considered of the first\r\nimportance, absorbed from the beginning a very large part of the\r\nallied attack, and so made a valuable diversion in favor of Great\r\nBritain. To this view of the principal features of the natural\r\nstrategic situation in Europe may properly be added the remark, that\r\nsuch aid as Holland might be inclined to send to the allied fleets had\r\na very insecure line of communication, being forced to pass along the\r\nEnglish base on the Channel. Such aid in fact was never given.\r\n\r\nIn North America the local bases of the war at its outbreak were New\r\nYork, Narragansett Bay, and Boston. The two former were then held by\r\nthe English, and were the most important stations on the continent,\r\nfrom their position, susceptibility of defence, and resources. Boston\r\nhad passed into the hands of the Americans, and was therefore at the\r\nservice of the allies. From the direction actually given to the war,\r\nby diverting the active English operations to the Southern States in\r\n1779, Boston was thrown outside the principal theatre of operations,\r\nand became from its position militarily unimportant; but had the plan\r\nbeen adopted of isolating New England by holding the line of the\r\nHudson and Lake Champlain, and concentrating military effort to the\r\neastward, it will be seen that these three ports would all have been\r\nof decisive importance to the issue. South of New York, the Delaware\r\nand Chesapeake Bays undoubtedly offered tempting fields for maritime\r\nenterprise; but the width of the entrances, the want of suitable and\r\neasily defended points for naval stations near the sea, the wide\r\ndispersal of the land forces entailed by an attempt to hold so many\r\npoints, and the sickliness of the locality during a great part of the\r\nyear, should have excepted them from a principal part in the plan of\r\nthe first campaigns. It is not necessary to include them among the\r\nlocal bases of the war. To the extreme south the English were drawn by\r\nthe _ignis fatuus_ of expected support among the people. They failed\r\nto consider that even if a majority there preferred quiet to freedom,\r\nthat very quality would prevent them from rising against the\r\nrevolutionary government by which, on the English theory, they were\r\noppressed; yet upon such a rising the whole success of this distant\r\nand in its end most unfortunate enterprise was staked. The local base\r\nof this war apart was Charleston, which passed into the hands of the\r\nBritish in May, 1780, eighteen months after the first expedition had\r\nlanded in Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe principal local bases of the war in the West Indies are already\r\nknown through the previous narrative. They were for the English,\r\nBarbadoes, Sta. Lucia, and to a less degree Antigua. A thousand miles\r\nto leeward was the large island of Jamaica, with a dock-yard of great\r\nnatural capabilities at Kingston. The allies held, in the first order\r\nof importance, Fort Royal in Martinique, and Havana; in the second\r\norder, Guadeloupe and Cap Français. A controlling feature of the\r\nstrategic situation in that day, and one which will not be wholly\r\nwithout weight in our own, was the trade-wind, with its accompanying\r\ncurrent. A passage to windward against these obstacles was a long and\r\nserious undertaking even for single ships, much more for larger\r\nbodies. It followed that fleets would go to the western islands only\r\nreluctantly, or when assured that the enemy had taken the same\r\ndirection, as Rodney went to Jamaica after the Battle of the Saints,\r\nknowing the French fleet to have gone to Cap Français. This condition\r\nof the wind made the windward, or eastern, islands points on the\r\nnatural lines of communication between Europe and America, as well as\r\nlocal bases of the naval war, and tied the fleets to them. Hence also\r\nit followed that between the two scenes of operations, between the\r\ncontinent and the Lesser Antilles, was interposed a wide central\r\nregion into which the larger operations of war could not safely be\r\ncarried except by a belligerent possessed of great naval superiority,\r\nor unless a decisive advantage had been gained upon one flank. In\r\n1762, when England held all the Windward Islands, with undisputed\r\nsuperiority at sea, she safely attacked and subdued Havana; but in the\r\nyears 1779-1782 the French sea power in America and the French tenure\r\nof the Windward Islands practically balanced her own, leaving the\r\nSpaniards at Havana free to prosecute their designs against Pensacola\r\nand the Bahamas, in the central region mentioned.[233]\r\n\r\nPosts like Martinique and Sta. Lucia had therefore for the present war\r\ngreat strategic advantage over Jamaica, Havana, or others to leeward.\r\nThey commanded the latter in virtue of their position, by which the\r\npassage westward could be made so much more quickly than the return;\r\nwhile the decisive points of the continental struggle were practically\r\nlittle farther from the one than from the other. This advantage was\r\nshared equally by most of those known as the Lesser Antilles; but the\r\nsmall island of Barbadoes, being well to windward of all, possessed\r\npeculiar advantages, not only for offensive action, but because it was\r\ndefended by the difficulty with which a large fleet could approach it,\r\neven from so near a port as Fort Royal. It will be remembered that the\r\nexpedition which finally sat down before St. Kitt's had been intended\r\nfor Barbadoes, but could not reach it through the violence of the\r\ntrade-wind. Thus Barbadoes, under the conditions of the time, was\r\npeculiarly fitted to be the local base and depot of the English war,\r\nas well as a wayside port of refuge on the line of communications to\r\nJamaica, Florida, and even to North America; while Sta. Lucia, a\r\nhundred miles to leeward, was held in force as an advanced post for\r\nthe fleet, watching closely the enemy at Fort Royal.\r\n\r\nIn India the political conditions of the peninsula necessarily\r\nindicated the eastern, or Coromandel, coast as the scene of\r\noperations. Trincomalee, in the adjacent island of Ceylon, though\r\nunhealthy, offered an excellent and defensible harbor, and thus\r\nacquired first-rate strategic importance, all the other anchorages on\r\nthe coast being mere open roadsteads. From this circumstance the\r\ntrade-winds, or monsoons, in this region also had strategic bearing.\r\nFrom the autumnal to the spring equinox the wind blows regularly from\r\nthe northeast, at times with much violence, throwing a heavy surf upon\r\nthe beach and making landing difficult; but during the summer months\r\nthe prevailing wind is southwest, giving comparatively smooth seas and\r\ngood weather. The \"change of the monsoon,\" in September and October,\r\nis often marked by violent hurricanes. Active operations, or even\r\nremaining on the coast, were therefore unadvisable from this time\r\nuntil the close of the northeast monsoon. The question of a port to\r\nwhich to retire during this season was pressing. Trincomalee was the\r\nonly one, and its unique strategic value was heightened by being to\r\nwindward, during the fine season, of the principal scene of war. The\r\nEnglish harbor of Bombay on the west coast was too distant to be\r\nconsidered a local base, and rather falls, like the French islands\r\nMauritius and Bourbon, under the head of stations on the line of\r\ncommunications with the mother-country.\r\n\r\nSuch were the principal points of support, or bases, of the\r\nbelligerent nations, at home and abroad. Of those abroad it must be\r\nsaid, speaking generally, that they were deficient in resources,--an\r\nimportant element of strategic value. Naval and military stores and\r\nequipments, and to a great extent provisions for sea use, had to be\r\nsent them from the mother-countries. Boston, surrounded by a thriving,\r\nfriendly population, was perhaps an exception to this statement, as\r\nwas also Havana, at that time an important naval arsenal, where much\r\nship-building was done; but these were distant from the principal\r\ntheatres of war. Upon New York and Narragansett Bay the Americans\r\npressed too closely for the resources of the neighboring country to be\r\nlargely available, while the distant ports of the East and West Indies\r\ndepended wholly upon home. Hence the strategic question of\r\ncommunications assumed additional importance. To intercept a large\r\nconvoy of supply-ships was an operation only secondary to the\r\ndestruction of a body of ships-of-war; while to protect such by main\r\nstrength, or by evading the enemy's search, taxed the skill of the\r\ngovernments and naval commanders in distributing the ships-of-war and\r\nsquadrons at their disposal, among the many objects which demanded\r\nattention. The address of Kempenfeldt and the bad management of\r\nGuichen in the North Atlantic, seconded by a heavy gale of wind,\r\nseriously embarrassed De Grasse in the West Indies. Similar injury, by\r\ncutting off small convoys in the Atlantic, was done to Suffren in the\r\nIndian seas: while the latter at once made good part of these losses,\r\nand worried his opponents by the success of his cruisers preying on\r\nthe English supply-ships.\r\n\r\nThus the navies, by which alone these vital streams could be secured\r\nor endangered, bore the same relation to the maintenance of the\r\ngeneral war that has already been observed of the separate parts. They\r\nwere the links that bound the whole together, and were therefore\r\nindicated as the proper objective of both belligerents.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Europe to America was not such as to make\r\nintermediate ports of supply absolutely necessary; while if difficulty\r\ndid arise from an unforeseen cause, it was always possible, barring\r\nmeeting an enemy, either to return to Europe or to make a friendly\r\nport in the West Indies. The case was different with the long voyage\r\nto India by the Cape of Good Hope. Bickerton, leaving England with a\r\nconvoy in February, was thought to have done well in reaching Bombay\r\nthe following September; while the ardent Suffren, sailing in March,\r\ntook an equal time to reach Mauritius, whence the passage to Madras\r\nconsumed two months more. A voyage of such duration could rarely be\r\nmade without a stop for water, for fresh provision, often for such\r\nrefitting as called for the quiet of a harbor, even when the stores on\r\nboard furnished the necessary material. A perfect line of\r\ncommunications required, as has been said, several such harbors,\r\nproperly spaced, adequately defended, and with abundant supplies, such\r\nas England in the present day holds on some of her main commercial\r\nroutes, acquisitions of her past wars. In the war of 1778 none of the\r\nbelligerents had such ports on this route, until by the accession of\r\nHolland, the Cape of Good Hope was put at the disposal of the French\r\nand suitably strengthened by Suffren. With this and the Mauritius on\r\nthe way, and Trincomalee at the far end of the road, the\r\ncommunications of the allies with France were reasonably guarded.\r\nEngland, though then holding St. Helena, depended, for the refreshment\r\nand refitting of her India-bound squadrons and convoys in the\r\nAtlantic, upon the benevolent neutrality of Portugal, extended in the\r\nislands of Madeira and Cape Verde and in the Brazilian ports. This\r\nneutrality was indeed a frail reliance for defence, as was shown by\r\nthe encounter between Johnstone and Suffren at the Cape Verde; but\r\nthere being several possible stopping-places, and the enemy unable to\r\nknow which, if any, would be used, this ignorance itself conferred no\r\nsmall security, if the naval commander did not trust it to the neglect\r\nof proper disposition of his own force, as did Johnstone at Porto\r\nPraya. Indeed, with the delay and uncertainty which then characterized\r\nthe transmission of intelligence from one point to another, doubt\r\nwhere to find the enemy was a greater bar to offensive enterprises\r\nthan the often slight defences of a colonial port.\r\n\r\nThis combination of useful harbors and the conditions of the\r\ncommunications between them constitute, as has been said, the main\r\nstrategic outlines of the situation. The navy, as the organized force\r\nlinking the whole together, has been indicated as the principal\r\nobjective of military effort. The method employed to reach the\r\nobjective, the conduct of the war, is still to be considered.[234]\r\n\r\nBefore doing this a condition peculiar to the sea, and affecting the\r\nfollowing discussion, must be briefly mentioned; that is, the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining information. Armies pass through countries\r\nmore or less inhabited by a stationary population, and they leave\r\nbehind them traces of their march. Fleets move through a desert over\r\nwhich wanderers flit, but where they do not remain; and as the waters\r\nclose behind them, an occasional waif from the decks may indicate\r\ntheir passage, but tells nothing of their course. The sail spoken by\r\nthe pursuer may know nothing of the pursued, which yet passed the\r\npoint of parley but a few days or hours before. Of late, careful study\r\nof the winds and currents of the ocean has laid down certain\r\nadvantageous routes, which will be habitually followed by a careful\r\nseaman, and afford some presumption as to his movements; but in 1778\r\nthe data for such precision were not collected, and even had they\r\nbeen, the quickest route must often have been abandoned for one of the\r\nmany possible ones, in order to elude pursuit or lying-in-wait. In\r\nsuch a game of hide-and-seek the advantage is with the sought, and the\r\ngreat importance of watching the outlets of an enemy's country, of\r\nstopping the chase before it has got away into the silent desert, is\r\nat once evident. If for any reason such a watch there is impossible,\r\nthe next best thing is, not attempting to watch routes which may not\r\nbe taken, to get first to the enemy's destination and await him there;\r\nbut this implies a knowledge of his intentions which may not always be\r\nobtainable. The action of Suffren, when pitted against Johnstone, was\r\nthroughout strategically sound, both in his attack at Porto Praya and\r\nin the haste with which he made for their common destination; while\r\nthe two failures of Rodney to intercept the convoys to Martinique in\r\n1780 and 1782, though informed that they were coming, show the\r\ndifficulty which attended lying-in-wait even when the point of arrival\r\nwas known.\r\n\r\nOf any maritime expedition two points only are fixed,--the point of\r\ndeparture and that of arrival. The latter may be unknown to the enemy;\r\nbut up to the time of sailing, the presence of a certain force in a\r\nport, and the indications of a purpose soon to move, may be assumed to\r\nbe known. It may be of moment to either belligerent to intercept such\r\na movement; but it is more especially and universally necessary to the\r\ndefence, because, of the many points at which he is open to attack, it\r\nmay be impossible for him to know which is threatened; whereas the\r\noffence proceeds with full knowledge direct to his aim, if he can\r\ndeceive his opponent. The importance of blocking such an expedition\r\nbecomes yet more evident should it at any time be divided between two\r\nor more ports,--a condition which may easily arise when the facilities\r\nof a single dock-yard are insufficient to fit out so many ships in\r\nthe time allowed, or when, as in the present war, allied powers\r\nfurnish separate contingents. To prevent the junction of these\r\ncontingents is a matter of prime necessity, and nowhere can this be\r\ndone so certainly as off the ports whence one or both is to sail. The\r\ndefence, from its very name, is presumably the less strong, and is\r\ntherefore the more bound to take advantage of such a source of\r\nweakness as the division of the enemy's force. Rodney in 1782 at Sta.\r\nLucia, watching the French contingent at Martinique to prevent its\r\nunion with the Spaniards at Cap Français, is an instance of correct\r\nstrategic position; and had the islands been so placed as to put him\r\nbetween the French and their destination, instead of in their rear,\r\nnothing better could have been devised. As it was, he did the best\r\nthing possible under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe defence, being the weaker, cannot attempt to block _all_ the ports\r\nwhere divisions of the enemy lie, without defeating his aim by being\r\nin inferior force before each. This would be to neglect the\r\nfundamental principles of war. If he correctly decide not to do this,\r\nbut to collect a superior force before one or two points, it becomes\r\nnecessary to decide which shall be thus guarded and which\r\nneglected,--a question involving the whole policy of the war after a\r\nfull understanding of the main conditions, military, moral, and\r\neconomic, in every quarter.\r\n\r\nThe defensive was necessarily accepted by England in 1778. It had been\r\na maxim with the best English naval authorities of the preceding era,\r\nwith Hawke and his contemporaries, that the British navy should be\r\nkept equal in numbers to the combined fleets of the Bourbon\r\nkingdoms,--a condition which, with the better quality of the\r\n_personnel_ and the larger maritime population upon which it could\r\ndraw, would have given a real superiority of force. This precaution,\r\nhowever, had not been observed during recent years. It is of no\r\nconsequence to this discussion whether the failure was due to the\r\ninefficiency of the ministry, as was charged by their opponents, or to\r\nthe misplaced economy often practised by representative governments\r\nin time of peace. The fact remains that, notwithstanding the notorious\r\nprobability of France and Spain joining in the war, the English navy\r\nwas inferior in number to that of the allies. In what have been called\r\nthe strategic features of the situation, the home bases, and the\r\nsecondary bases abroad, the advantage upon the whole lay with her. Her\r\npositions, if not stronger in themselves, were at least better\r\nsituated, geographically, for strategic effect; but in the second\r\nessential for war, the organized military force, or fleet, adequate to\r\noffensive operations, she had been allowed to become inferior. It only\r\nremained, therefore, to use this inferior force with such science and\r\nvigor as would frustrate the designs of the enemy, by getting first to\r\nsea, taking positions skilfully, anticipating their combinations by\r\ngreater quickness of movement, harassing their communications with\r\ntheir objectives, and meeting the principal divisions of the enemy\r\nwith superior forces.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficiently clear that the maintenance of this war, everywhere\r\nexcept on the American continent, depended upon the mother-countries\r\nin Europe and upon open communication with them. The ultimate crushing\r\nof the Americans, too, not by direct military effort but by\r\nexhaustion, was probable, if England were left unmolested to strangle\r\ntheir commerce and industries with her overwhelming naval strength.\r\nThis strength she could put forth against them, if relieved from the\r\npressure of the allied navies; and relief would be obtained if she\r\ncould gain over them a decided preponderance, not merely material but\r\nmoral, such as she had twenty years later. In that case the allied\r\ncourts, whose financial weakness was well known, must retire from a\r\ncontest in which their main purpose of reducing England to an inferior\r\nposition was already defeated. Such preponderance, however, could only\r\nbe had by fighting; by showing that, despite inferiority in numbers,\r\nthe skill of her seamen and the resources of her wealth enabled her\r\ngovernment, by a wise use of these powers, to be actually superior at\r\nthe decisive points of the war. It could never be had by distributing\r\nthe ships-of-the-line all over the world, exposing them to be beaten\r\nin detail while endeavoring to protect all the exposed points of the\r\nscattered empire.\r\n\r\nThe key of the situation was in Europe, and in Europe in the hostile\r\ndock-yards. If England were unable, as she proved to be, to raise up a\r\ncontinental war against France, then her one hope was to find and\r\nstrike down the enemy's navy. Nowhere was it so certainly to be found\r\nas in its home ports; nowhere so easily met as immediately after\r\nleaving them. This dictated her policy in the Napoleonic wars, when\r\nthe moral superiority of her navy was so established that she dared to\r\noppose inferior forces to the combined dangers of the sea and of the\r\nmore numerous and well-equipped ships lying quietly at anchor inside.\r\nBy facing this double risk she obtained the double advantage of\r\nkeeping the enemy under her eyes, and of sapping his efficiency by the\r\neasy life of port, while her own officers and seamen were hardened by\r\nthe rigorous cruising into a perfect readiness for every call upon\r\ntheir energies. \"We have no reason,\" proclaimed Admiral Villeneuve in\r\n1805, echoing the words of the emperor, \"to fear the sight of an\r\nEnglish squadron. Their seventy-fours have not five hundred men on\r\nboard; they are worn out by a two years' cruise.\"[235] A month later\r\nhe wrote: \"The Toulon squadron appeared very fine in the harbor, the\r\ncrews well clothed and drilling well; but as soon as a storm came, all\r\nwas changed. They were not drilled in storms.\"[236] \"The emperor,\"\r\nsaid Nelson, \"now finds, if emperors hear truth, that his fleet\r\nsuffers more in a night than ours in one year.... These gentlemen are\r\nnot used to the hurricanes, which we have braved for twenty-one months\r\nwithout losing mast or yard.\"[237] It must be admitted, however, that\r\nthe strain was tremendous both on men and ships, and that many English\r\nofficers found in the wear and tear an argument against keeping their\r\nfleets at sea off the enemy's coast. \"Every one of the blasts we\r\nendure,\" wrote Collingwood, \"lessens the security of the country. The\r\nlast cruise disabled five large ships and two more lately; several of\r\nthem must be docked.\" \"I have hardly known what a night of rest is\r\nthese two months,\" wrote he again; \"this incessant cruising seems to\r\nme beyond the powers of human nature. Calder is worn to a shadow,\r\nquite broken down, and I am told Graves is not much better.\"[1] The\r\nhigh professional opinion of Lord Howe was also adverse to the\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nBesides the exhaustion of men and ships, it must also be admitted that\r\nno blockade could be relied on certainly to check the exit of an\r\nenemy's fleet. Villeneuve escaped from Toulon, Missiessy from\r\nRochefort. \"I am here watching the French squadron in Rochefort,\"\r\nwrote Collingwood, \"but feel that it is not practicable to prevent\r\ntheir sailing; and yet, if they should get by me, I should be\r\nexceedingly mortified.... The only thing that can prevent their\r\nsailing is the apprehension that they may get among us, as they cannot\r\nknow exactly where we are.\"[238]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the strain then was endured. The English fleets girdled\r\nthe shores of France and Spain; losses were made good; ships were\r\nrepaired; as one officer fell, or was worn out at his post, another\r\ntook his place. The strict guard over Brest broke up the emperor's\r\ncombinations; the watchfulness of Nelson, despite an unusual\r\nconcurrence of difficulties, followed the Toulon fleet, from the\r\nmoment of its starting, across the Atlantic and back to the shores of\r\nEurope. It was long before they came to blows, before strategy stepped\r\naside and tactics completed the work at Trafalgar; but step by step\r\nand point by point the rugged but disciplined seamen, the rusty and\r\nbattered but well-handled ships, blocked each move of their\r\nunpractised opponents. Disposed in force before each arsenal of the\r\nenemy, and linked together by chains of smaller vessels, they might\r\nfail now and again to check a raid, but they effectually stopped all\r\ngrand combinations of the enemy's squadrons.\r\n\r\nThe ships of 1805 were essentially the same as those of 1780. There\r\nhad doubtless been progress and improvement; but the changes were in\r\ndegree, not in kind. Not only so, but the fleets of twenty years\r\nearlier, under Hawke and his fellows, had dared the winters of the Bay\r\nof Biscay. \"There is not in Hawke's correspondence,\" says his\r\nbiographer, \"the slightest indication that he himself doubted for a\r\nmoment that it was not only possible, but his duty, to keep the sea,\r\neven through the storms of winter, and that he should soon be able to\r\n'make downright work of it.'\"[239] If it be urged that the condition\r\nof the French navy was better, the character and training of its\r\nofficers higher, than in the days of Hawke and Nelson, the fact must\r\nbe admitted; nevertheless, the admiralty could not long have been\r\nignorant that the number of such officers was still so deficient as\r\nseriously to affect the quality of the deck service, and the lack of\r\nseamen so great as to necessitate filling up the complements with\r\nsoldiers. As for the _personnel_ of the Spanish navy, there is no\r\nreason to believe it better than fifteen years later, when Nelson,\r\nspeaking of Spain giving certain ships to France, said, \"I take it for\r\ngranted not manned [by Spaniards], as that would be the readiest way\r\nto lose them again.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, however, it is too evident to need much arguing, that the\r\nsurest way for the weaker party to neutralize the enemy's ships was to\r\nwatch them in their harbors and fight them if they started. The only\r\nserious objection to doing this, in Europe, was the violence of the\r\nweather off the coasts of France and Spain, especially during the long\r\nnights of winter. This brought with it not only risk of immediate\r\ndisaster, which strong, well-managed ships would rarely undergo, but a\r\ncontinual strain which no skill could prevent, and which therefore\r\ncalled for a large reserve of ships to relieve those sent in for\r\nrepairs, or to refresh the crews.\r\n\r\nThe problem would be greatly simplified if the blockading fleet could\r\nfind a convenient anchorage on the flank of the route the enemy must\r\ntake, as Nelson in 1804 and 1805 used Maddalena Bay in Sardinia when\r\nwatching the Toulon fleet,--a step to which he was further forced by\r\nthe exceptionally bad condition of many of his ships. So Sir James\r\nSaumarez in 1800 even used Douarnenez Bay, on the French coast, only\r\nfive miles from Brest, to anchor the in-shore squadron of the\r\nblockading force in heavy weather. The positions at Plymouth and\r\nTorbay cannot be considered perfectly satisfactory from this point of\r\nview; not being, like Maddalena Bay, on the flank of the enemy's\r\nroute, but like Sta. Lucia, rather to its rear. Nevertheless, Hawke\r\nproved that diligence and well-managed ships could overcome this\r\ndisadvantage, as Rodney also afterward showed on his less tempestuous\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nIn the use of the ships at its disposal, taking the war of 1778 as a\r\nwhole, the English ministry kept their foreign detachments in America,\r\nand in the West and East Indies, equal to those of the enemy. At\r\nparticular times, indeed, this was not so; but speaking generally of\r\nthe assignment of ships, the statement is correct. In Europe, on the\r\ncontrary, and in necessary consequence of the policy mentioned, the\r\nBritish fleet was habitually much inferior to that in the French and\r\nSpanish ports. It therefore could be used offensively only by great\r\ncare, and through good fortune in meeting the enemy in detail; and\r\neven so an expensive victory, unless very decisive, entailed\r\nconsiderable risk from the consequent temporary disability of the\r\nships engaged. It followed that the English home (or Channel) fleet,\r\nupon which depended also the communications with Gibraltar and the\r\nMediterranean, was used very economically both as to battle and\r\nweather, and was confined to the defence of the home coast, or to\r\noperations against the enemy's communications.\r\n\r\nIndia was so far distant that no exception can be taken to the policy\r\nthere. Ships sent there went to stay, and could be neither reinforced\r\nnor recalled with a view to sudden emergencies. The field stood by\r\nitself. But Europe, North America, and the West Indies should have\r\nbeen looked upon as one large theatre of war, throughout which events\r\nwere mutually dependent, and whose different parts stood in close\r\nrelations of greater or less importance, to which due attention should\r\nhave been paid.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the navies, as the guardians of the communications, were\r\nthe controlling factors in the war, and that the source, both of the\r\nnavies and of those streams of supplies which are called\r\ncommunications, was in the mother-countries, and there centralized in\r\nthe chief arsenals, two things follow: First, the main effort of the\r\nPower standing on the defensive, of Great Britain, should have been\r\nconcentrated before those arsenals; and secondly, in order to such\r\nconcentration, the lines of communication abroad should not have been\r\nneedlessly extended, so as to increase beyond the strictest necessity\r\nthe detachments to guard them. Closely connected with the last\r\nconsideration is the duty of strengthening, by fortification and\r\notherwise, the vital points to which the communications led, so that\r\nthese points should not depend in any way upon the fleet for\r\nprotection, but only for supplies and reinforcements, and those at\r\nreasonable intervals. Gibraltar, for instance, quite fulfilled these\r\nconditions, being practically impregnable, and storing supplies that\r\nlasted very long.\r\n\r\nIf this reasoning be correct, the English dispositions on the American\r\ncontinent were very faulty. Holding Canada, with Halifax, New York,\r\nand Narragansett Bay, and with the line of the Hudson within their\r\ngrip, it was in their power to isolate a large, perhaps decisive, part\r\nof the insurgent territory. New York and Narragansett Bay could have\r\nbeen made unassailable by a French fleet of that day, thus assuring\r\nthe safety of the garrisons against attacks from the sea and\r\nminimizing the task of the navy; while the latter would find in them a\r\nsecure refuge, in case an enemy's force eluded the watch of the\r\nEnglish fleet before a European arsenal and appeared on the coast.\r\nInstead of this, these two ports were left weak, and would have fallen\r\nbefore a Nelson or a Farragut, while the army in New York was twice\r\ndivided, first to the Chesapeake and afterward to Georgia, neither\r\npart of the separated forces being strong enough for the work before\r\nit. The control of the sea was thus used in both cases to put the\r\nenemy between the divided portions of the English army, when the\r\nlatter, undivided, had not been able to force its way over the ground\r\nthus interposed. As the communication between the two parts of the\r\narmy depended wholly upon the sea, the duty of the navy was increased\r\nwith the increased length of the lines of communication. The necessity\r\nof protecting the seaports and the lengthened lines of communication\r\nthus combined to augment the naval detachments in America, and to\r\nweaken proportionately the naval force at the decisive points in\r\nEurope. Thus also a direct consequence of the southern expedition was\r\nthe hasty abandonment of Narragansett Bay, when D'Estaing appeared on\r\nthe coast in 1779, because Clinton had not force enough to defend both\r\nit and New York.[240]\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies the problem before the English government was not\r\nto subdue revolted territory, but to preserve the use of a number of\r\nsmall, fruitful islands; to keep possession of them itself, and to\r\nmaintain their trade as free as possible from the depredations of the\r\nenemy. It need not be repeated that this demanded predominance at sea\r\nover both the enemy's fleets and single cruisers,--\"commerce-destroyers,\"\r\nas the latter are now styled. As no vigilance can confine all these to\r\ntheir ports, the West Indian waters must be patrolled by British\r\nfrigates and lighter vessels; but it would surely be better, if\r\npossible, to keep the French fleet away altogether than to hold it in\r\ncheck by a British fleet on the spot, of only equal force at any time,\r\nand liable to fall, as it often did, below equality. England, being\r\nconfined to the defensive, was always liable to loss when thus\r\ninferior. She actually did lose one by one, by sudden attack, most of\r\nher islands, and at different times had her fleet shut up under the\r\nbatteries of a port; whereas the enemy, when he found himself\r\ninferior, was able to wait for reinforcements, knowing that he had\r\nnothing to fear while so waiting.[241]\r\n\r\nNor was this embarrassment confined to the West Indies. The nearness\r\nof the islands to the American continent made it always possible for\r\nthe offence to combine his fleets in the two quarters before the\r\ndefence could be sure of his purpose; and although such combinations\r\nwere controlled in some measure by well-understood conditions of\r\nweather and the seasons, the events of 1780 and 1781 show the\r\nperplexity felt from this cause by the ablest English admiral, whose\r\ndispositions, though faulty, but reflected the uncertainties of his\r\nmind. When to this embarrassment, which is common to the defensive in\r\nall cases, is added the care of the great British trade upon which the\r\nprosperity of the empire mainly depended, it must be conceded that the\r\ntask of the British admiral in the West Indies was neither light nor\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the safety of England herself and of Gibraltar was gravely\r\nimperilled by the absence of these large detachments in the Western\r\nHemisphere, to which may also be attributed the loss of Minorca. When\r\nsixty-six allied ships-of-the-line confronted the thirty-five which\r\nalone England could collect, and drove them into their harbors, there\r\nwas realized that mastery of the Channel which Napoleon claimed would\r\nmake him beyond all doubt master of England. For thirty days, the\r\nthirty ships which formed the French contingent had cruised in the Bay\r\nof Biscay, awaiting the arrival of the tardy Spaniards; but they were\r\nnot disturbed by the English fleet. Gibraltar was more than once\r\nbrought within sight of starvation, through the failure of\r\ncommunications with England; and its deliverance was due, not to the\r\npower of the English navy suitably disposed by its government, but to\r\nthe skill of British officers and the inefficiency of the Spaniards.\r\nIn the great final relief, Lord Howe's fleet numbered only thirty-four\r\nto the allied forty-nine.\r\n\r\nWhich, then, in the difficulties under which England labored, was the\r\nbetter course,--to allow the enemy free exit from his ports and\r\nendeavor to meet him by maintaining a sufficient naval force on each\r\nof the exposed stations, or to attempt to watch his arsenals at home,\r\nunder all the difficulties of the situation, not with the vain hope of\r\npreventing every raid, or intercepting every convoy, but with the\r\nexpectation of frustrating the greater combinations, and of following\r\nclose at the heels of any large fleet that escaped? Such a watch must\r\nnot be confounded with a blockade, a term frequently, but not quite\r\naccurately, applied to it. \"I beg to inform your Lordship,\" wrote\r\nNelson, \"that the port of Toulon has never been blockaded by me; quite\r\nthe reverse. Every opportunity has been offered the enemy to put to\r\nsea, for it is there we hope to realize the hopes and expectations of\r\nour country.\" \"Nothing,\" he says again, \"ever kept the French fleet in\r\nToulon or Brest when they had a mind to come out;\" and although the\r\nstatement is somewhat exaggerated, it is true that the attempt to shut\r\nthem up in port would have been hopeless. What Nelson expected by\r\nkeeping near their ports, with enough lookout ships properly\r\ndistributed, was to know when they sailed and what direction they\r\ntook, intending, to use his own expression, to \"follow them to the\r\nantipodes.\" \"I am led to believe,\" he writes at another time, \"that\r\nthe Ferrol squadron of French ships will push for the Mediterranean.\r\nIf it join that in Toulon, it will much outnumber us; but I shall\r\nnever lose sight of them, and Pellew (commanding the English squadron\r\noff Ferrol) will soon be after them.\" So it happened often enough\r\nduring that prolonged war that divisions of French ships escaped,\r\nthrough stress of weather, temporary absence of a blockading fleet, or\r\nmisjudgment on the part of its commander; but the alarm was quickly\r\ngiven, some of the many frigates caught sight of them, followed to\r\ndetect their probable destination, passed the word from point to point\r\nand from fleet to fleet, and soon a division of equal force was after\r\nthem, \"to the antipodes\" if need were. As, according to the\r\ntraditional use of the French navy by French governments, their\r\nexpeditions went not to fight the hostile fleet, but with \"ulterior\r\nobjects,\" the angry buzz and hot pursuit that immediately followed was\r\nfar from conducive to an undisturbed and methodical execution of the\r\nprogramme laid down, even by a single division; while to great\r\ncombinations, dependent upon uniting the divisions from different\r\nports, they were absolutely fatal. The adventurous cruise of Bruix,\r\nleaving Brest with twenty-five ships-of-the-line in 1799, the rapidity\r\nwith which the news spread, the stirring action and individual\r\nmistakes of the English, the frustration of the French projects[242]\r\nand the closeness of the pursuit,[243] the escape of Missiessy from\r\nRochefort in 1805, of the divisions of Willaumez and Leissegues from\r\nBrest in 1806,--all these may be named, along with the great Trafalgar\r\ncampaign, as affording interesting studies of a naval strategy\r\nfollowing the lines here suggested; while the campaign of 1798,\r\ndespite its brilliant ending at the Nile, may be cited as a case where\r\nfailure nearly ensued, owing to the English having no force before\r\nToulon when the expedition sailed, and to Nelson being insufficiently\r\nprovided with frigates. The nine weeks' cruise of Ganteaume in the\r\nMediterranean, in 1808, also illustrates the difficulty of controlling\r\na fleet which has been permitted to get out, unwatched by a strong\r\nforce, even in such narrow waters.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN.]\r\n\r\nNo parallel instances can be cited from the war of 1778, although the\r\nold monarchy did not cover the movements of its fleets with the\r\nsecrecy enforced by the stern military despotism of the Empire. In\r\nboth epochs England stood on the defensive; but in the earlier war she\r\ngave up the first line of the defence, off the hostile ports, and\r\ntried to protect all parts of her scattered empire by dividing the\r\nfleet among them. It has been attempted to show the weakness of the\r\none policy, while admitting the difficulties and dangers of the other.\r\nThe latter aims at shortening and deciding the war by either shutting\r\nup or forcing battle upon the hostile navy, recognizing that this is\r\nthe key of the situation, when the sea at once unites and separates\r\nthe different parts of the theatre of war. It requires a navy equal in\r\nnumber and superior in efficiency, to which it assigns a limited field\r\nof action, narrowed to the conditions which admit of mutual support\r\namong the squadrons occupying it. Thus distributed, it relies upon\r\nskill and watchfulness to intercept or overtake any division of the\r\nenemy which gets to sea. It defends remote possessions and trade by\r\noffensive action against the fleet, in which it sees their real enemy\r\nand its own principal objective. Being near the home ports, the relief\r\nand renewal of ships needing repairs are accomplished with the least\r\nloss of time, while the demands upon the scantier resources of the\r\nbases abroad are lessened. The other policy, to be effective, calls\r\nfor superior numbers, because the different divisions are too far\r\napart for mutual support. Each must therefore be equal to any probable\r\ncombination against it, which implies superiority everywhere to the\r\nforce of the enemy actually opposed, as the latter may be unexpectedly\r\nreinforced. How impossible and dangerous such a defensive strategy is,\r\nwhen not superior in force, is shown by the frequent inferiority of\r\nthe English abroad, as well as in Europe, despite the effort to be\r\neverywhere equal. Howe at New York in 1778, Byron at Grenada in 1779,\r\nGraves off the Chesapeake in 1781, Hood at Martinique in 1781 and at\r\nSt. Kitt's in 1782, all were inferior, at the same time that the\r\nallied fleet in Europe overwhelmingly outnumbered the English. In\r\nconsequence, unseaworthy ships were retained, to the danger of their\r\ncrews and their own increasing injury, rather than diminish the force\r\nby sending them home; for the deficiencies of the colonial dock-yards\r\ndid not allow extensive repairs without crossing the Atlantic. As\r\nregards the comparative expense of the two strategies, the question is\r\nnot only which would cost the more in the same time, but which would\r\nmost tend to shorten the war by the effectiveness of its action.\r\n\r\nThe military policy of the allies is open to severer condemnation than\r\nthat of England, by so much as the party assuming the offensive has by\r\nthat very fact an advantage over the defensive. When the initial\r\ndifficulty of combining their forces was overcome,--and it has been\r\nseen that at no time did Great Britain seriously embarrass their\r\njunction,--the allies had the choice open to them where, when, and how\r\nto strike with their superior numbers. How did they avail themselves\r\nof this recognized enormous advantage? By nibbling at the outskirts of\r\nthe British Empire, and knocking their heads against the Rock of\r\nGibraltar. The most serious military effort made by France, in sending\r\nto the United States a squadron and division of troops intended to be\r\ndouble the number of those which actually reached their destination,\r\nresulted, in little over a year, in opening the eyes of England to the\r\nhopelessness of the contest with the colonies and thus put an end to a\r\ndiversion of her strength which had been most beneficial to her\r\nopponents. In the West Indies one petty island after another was\r\nreduced, generally in the absence of the English fleet, with an ease\r\nwhich showed how completely the whole question would have been solved\r\nby a decisive victory over that fleet; but the French, though favored\r\nwith many opportunities, never sought to slip the knot by the simple\r\nmethod of attacking the force upon which all depended. Spain went her\r\nown way in the Floridas, and with an overwhelming force obtained\r\nsuccesses of no military value. In Europe the plan adopted by the\r\nEnglish government left its naval force hopelessly inferior in numbers\r\nyear after year; yet the operations planned by the allies seem in no\r\ncase seriously to have contemplated the destruction of that force. In\r\nthe crucial instance, when Derby's squadron of thirty sail-of-the-line\r\nwas hemmed in the open roadstead of Torbay by the allied forty-nine,\r\nthe conclusion of the council of war not to fight only epitomized the\r\ncharacter of the action of the combined navies. To further embarrass\r\ntheir exertions in Europe, Spain, during long periods, obstinately\r\npersisted in tying down her fleet to the neighborhood of Gibraltar;\r\nbut there was at no time practical recognition of the fact that a\r\nsevere blow to the English navy in the Straits, or in the English\r\nChannel, or on the open sea, was the surest road to reduce the\r\nfortress, brought more than once within measurable distance of\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of their offensive war the allied courts suffered from\r\nthe divergent counsels and jealousies which have hampered the\r\nmovements of most naval coalitions. The conduct of Spain appears to\r\nhave been selfish almost to disloyalty, that of France more faithful,\r\nand therefore also militarily sounder; for hearty co-operation and\r\nconcerted action against a common objective, wisely chosen, would have\r\nbetter forwarded the objects of both. It must be admitted, too, that\r\nthe indications point to inefficient administration and preparation on\r\nthe part of the allies, of Spain especially; and that the quality of\r\nthe _personnel_[244] was inferior to that of England. Questions of\r\npreparation and administration, however, though of deep military\r\ninterest and importance, are very different from the strategic plan or\r\nmethod adopted by the allied courts in selecting and attacking their\r\nobjectives, and so compassing the objects of the war; and their\r\nexamination would not only extend this discussion unreasonably, but\r\nwould also obscure the strategic question by heaping up unnecessary\r\ndetails foreign to its subject.\r\n\r\nAs regards the strategic question, it may be said pithily that the\r\nphrase \"ulterior objects\" embodies the cardinal fault of the naval\r\npolicy. Ulterior objects brought to nought the hopes of the allies,\r\nbecause, by fastening their eyes upon them, they thoughtlessly passed\r\nthe road which led to them. Desire eagerly directed upon the ends in\r\nview--or rather upon the partial, though great, advantages which they\r\nconstituted their ends--blinded them to the means by which alone they\r\ncould be surely attained; hence, as the result of the war, everywhere\r\nfailure to attain them. To quote again the summary before given, their\r\nobject was \"to avenge their respective injuries, and to put an end to\r\nthat tyrannical empire which England claims to maintain upon the\r\nocean.\" The revenge they had obtained was barren of benefit to\r\nthemselves. They had, so that generation thought, injured England by\r\nliberating America; but they had not righted their wrongs in Gibraltar\r\nand Jamaica, the English fleet had not received any such treatment as\r\nwould lessen its haughty self-reliance, the armed neutrality of the\r\nnorthern powers had been allowed to pass fruitlessly away, and the\r\nEnglish empire over the seas soon became as tyrannical and more\r\nabsolute than before.\r\n\r\nBarring questions of preparation and administration, of the fighting\r\nquality of the allied fleets as compared with the English, and looking\r\nonly to the indisputable fact of largely superior numbers, it must be\r\nnoted as the supreme factor in the military conduct of the war, that,\r\nwhile the allied powers were on the offensive and England on the\r\ndefensive, the attitude of the allied fleets in presence of the\r\nEnglish navy was habitually defensive. Neither in the greater\r\nstrategic combinations, nor upon the battlefield, does there appear\r\nany serious purpose of using superior numbers to crush fractions of\r\nthe enemy's fleet, to make the disparity of numbers yet greater, to\r\nput an end to the empire of the seas by the destruction of the\r\norganized force which sustained it. With the single brilliant\r\nexception of Suffren, the allied navies avoided or accepted action;\r\nthey never imposed it. Yet so long as the English navy was permitted\r\nthus with impunity to range the seas, not only was there no security\r\nthat it would not frustrate the ulterior objects of the campaign, as\r\nit did again and again, but there was always the possibility that by\r\nsome happy chance it would, by winning an important victory, restore\r\nthe balance of strength. That it did not do so is to be imputed as a\r\nfault to the English ministry; but if England was wrong in permitting\r\nher European fleet to fall so far below that of the allies, the latter\r\nwere yet more to blame for their failure to profit by the mistake. The\r\nstronger party, assuming the offensive, cannot plead the perplexities\r\nwhich account for, though they do not justify, the undue dispersal of\r\nforces by the defence anxious about many points.\r\n\r\nThe national bias of the French, which found expression in the line of\r\naction here again and for the last time criticised, appears to have\r\nbeen shared by both the government and the naval officers of the day.\r\nIt is the key to the course of the French navy, and, in the opinion of\r\nthe author, to its failure to achieve more substantial results to\r\nFrance from this war. It is instructive, as showing how strong a hold\r\ntradition has over the minds of men, that a body of highly\r\naccomplished and gallant seamen should have accepted, apparently\r\nwithout a murmur, so inferior a rôle for their noble profession. It\r\ncarries also a warning, if these criticisms are correct, that current\r\nopinions and plausible impressions should always be thoroughly\r\ntested; for if erroneous they work sure failure, and perhaps disaster.\r\n\r\nThere was such an impression largely held by French officers of that\r\nday, and yet more widely spread in the United States now, of the\r\nefficacy of commerce-destroying as a main reliance in war, especially\r\nwhen directed against a commercial country like Great Britain. \"The\r\nsurest means in my opinion,\" wrote a distinguished officer,\r\nLamotte-Picquet, \"to conquer the English is to attack them in their\r\ncommerce.\" The harassment and distress caused to a country by serious\r\ninterference with its commerce will be conceded by all. It is\r\ndoubtless a most important secondary operation of naval war, and is\r\nnot likely to be abandoned till war itself shall cease; but regarded\r\nas a primary and fundamental measure, sufficient in itself to crush an\r\nenemy, it is probably a delusion, and a most dangerous delusion, when\r\npresented in the fascinating garb of cheapness to the representatives\r\nof a people. Especially is it misleading when the nation against whom\r\nit is to be directed possesses, as Great Britain did and does, the two\r\nrequisites of a strong sea power,--a wide-spread healthy commerce and\r\na powerful navy. Where the revenues and industries of a country can be\r\nconcentrated into a few treasure-ships, like the flota of Spanish\r\ngalleons, the sinew of war may perhaps be cut by a stroke; but when\r\nits wealth is scattered in thousands of going and coming ships, when\r\nthe roots of the system spread wide and far, and strike deep, it can\r\nstand many a cruel shock and lose many a goodly bough without the life\r\nbeing touched. Only by military command of the sea by prolonged\r\ncontrol of the strategic centres of commerce, can such an attack be\r\nfatal;[245] and such control can be wrung from a powerful navy only\r\nby fighting and overcoming it. For two hundred years England has been\r\nthe great commercial nation of the world. More than any other her\r\nwealth has been intrusted to the sea in war as in peace; yet of all\r\nnations she has ever been most reluctant to concede the immunities of\r\ncommerce and the rights of neutrals. Regarded not as a matter of\r\nright, but of policy, history has justified the refusal; and if she\r\nmaintain her navy in full strength, the future will doubtless repeat\r\nthe lesson of the past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries of the peace between Great Britain and the allied\r\ncourts, which brought to an end this great war, were signed at\r\nVersailles, January 20, 1783, an arrangement having been concluded\r\nbetween Great Britain and the American Commissioners two months\r\nbefore, by which the independence of the United States was conceded.\r\nThis was the great outcome of the war. As between the European\r\nbelligerents, Great Britain received back from France all the West\r\nIndia Islands she had lost, except Tobago, and gave up Sta. Lucia. The\r\nFrench stations in India were restored; and Trincomalee being in the\r\npossession of the enemy, England could not dispute its return to\r\nHolland, but she refused to cede Negapatam. To Spain, England\r\nsurrendered the two Floridas and Minorca, the latter a serious loss\r\nhad the naval power of Spain been sufficient to maintain possession of\r\nit; as it was, it again fell into the hands of Great Britain in the\r\nnext war. Some unimportant redistribution of trading-posts on the west\r\ncoast of Africa was also made.\r\n\r\nTrivial in themselves, there is but one comment that need be made upon\r\nthese arrangements. In any coming war their permanency would depend\r\nwholly upon the balance of sea power, upon that empire of the seas\r\nconcerning which nothing conclusive had been established by the war.\r\n\r\nThe definitive treaties of peace were signed at Versailles, September\r\n3, 1783.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[231] Jurien de la Gravière: Guerres Maritimes, vol. ii. p. 255.\r\n\r\n[232] See map of the Atlantic Ocean, p. 532.\r\n\r\n[233] It may be said here in passing, that the key to the English\r\npossessions in what was then called West Florida was at Pensacola and\r\nMobile, which depended upon Jamaica for support; the conditions of the\r\ncountry, of navigation, and of the general continental war forbidding\r\nassistance from the Atlantic. The English force, military and naval,\r\nat Jamaica was only adequate to the defence of the island and of\r\ntrade, and could not afford sufficient relief to Florida. The capture\r\nof the latter and of the Bahamas was effected with little difficulty\r\nby overwhelming Spanish forces, as many as fifteen ships-of-the-line\r\nand seven thousand troops having been employed against Pensacola.\r\nThese events will receive no other mention. Their only bearing upon\r\nthe general war was the diversion of this imposing force from joint\r\noperations with the French, Spain here, as at Gibraltar, pursuing her\r\nown aims instead of concentrating upon the common enemy,--a policy as\r\nshortsighted as it was selfish.\r\n\r\n[234] In other words, having considered the objects for which the\r\nbelligerents were at war and the proper objectives upon which their\r\nmilitary efforts should have been directed to compass the objects, the\r\ndiscussion now considers how the military forces should have been\r\nhandled; by what means and at what point the objective, being mobile,\r\nshould have been assailed.\r\n\r\n[235] Orders of Admiral Villeneuve to the captains of his fleet, Dec.\r\n20, 1804.\r\n\r\n[236] Letter of Villeneuve, January, 1805.\r\n\r\n[237] Letters and Despatches of Lord Nelson.\r\n\r\n[238] Life and Letters of Lord Collingwood.\r\n\r\n[239] Burrows: Life of Lord Hawke.\r\n\r\n[240] Of this Rodney said: \"The evacuating Rhode Island was the most\r\nfatal measure that could possibly be adopted. It gave up the best and\r\nnoblest harbor in America, from whence squadrons, in forty-eight\r\nhours, could blockade the three capital cities of America, namely,\r\nBoston, New York, and Philadelphia.\" The whole letter, private to the\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty, is worth reading. (Life of Rodney, vol.\r\nii. p. 429.)\r\n\r\n[241] The loss of Sta. Lucia does not militate against this statement,\r\nbeing due to happy audacity and skill on the part of the English\r\nadmiral, and the professional incapacity of the commander of the\r\ngreatly superior French fleet.\r\n\r\n[242] The plan of campaign traced by the Directory for Bruix became\r\nimpossible of execution; the delay in the junction of the French and\r\nSpanish squadrons having permitted England to concentrate sixty ships\r\nin the Mediterranean.--_Troude_, vol. iii. p. 158.\r\n\r\n[243] The combined squadrons of France and Spain, under Bruix, reached\r\nBrest on their return only twenty-four hours before Lord Keith, who\r\nhad followed them from the Mediterranean. (James: Naval History of\r\nGreat Britain.)\r\n\r\n[244] The high professional attainments of many of the French officers\r\nis not overlooked in this statement. The quality of the _personnel_\r\nwas diluted by an inferior element, owing to the insufficient number\r\nof good men. \"The _personnel_ of our crews had been seriously affected\r\nby the events of the campaign of 1779. At the beginning of 1780 it was\r\nnecessary either to disarm some ships, or to increase the proportion\r\nof soldiers entering into the composition of the crews. The minister\r\nadopted the latter alternative. New regiments, drawn from the land\r\narmy, were put at the disposal of the navy. The corps of officers, far\r\nfrom numerous at the beginning of hostilities, had become completely\r\ninadequate. Rear-Admiral de Guichen met the greatest difficulty in\r\nforming the complements, both officers and crews, for his squadron. He\r\ntook the sea, February 3, with ships 'badly manned,' as he wrote to\r\nthe minister.\" (Chevalier: Hist. de la Marine Française, p. 184.)\r\n\"During the last war [of 1778] we had met the greatest difficulty in\r\nsupplying officers to our ships. If it had been easy to name admirals,\r\ncommodores, and captains, it had been impossible to fill the vacancies\r\ncaused by death, sickness, or promotion among officers of the rank of\r\nlieutenant and ensign.\" (Chevalier: Marine Française sous la\r\nRépublique, p. 20.)\r\n\r\n[245] The vital centre of English commerce is in the waters surrounding\r\nthe British Islands; and as the United Kingdom now depends largely upon\r\nexternal sources of food-supply, it follows that France is the nation\r\nmost favourably situated to harass it by commerce-destroying, on\r\naccount of her nearness and her possession of ports both on the\r\nAtlantic and the North Sea. From these issued the privateers which in\r\nthe past preyed upon English shipping. The position is stronger now\r\nthan formerly, Cherbourg presenting a good Channel port which France\r\nlacked in the old wars. On the other hand steam and railroads have made\r\nthe ports on the northern coasts of the United Kingdom more available,\r\nand British shipping need not, as formerly, focus about the Channel.\r\n\r\nMuch importance has been attached to the captures made during the late\r\nsummer manoeuvres (1888) by cruisers in and near the English Channel.\r\nThe United States must remember that such cruisers were near their\r\nhome ports. Their line of coal-supply may have been two hundred miles;\r\nit would be a very different thing to maintain them in activity three\r\nthousand miles from home. The furnishing of coal, or of such\r\nfacilities as cleaning the bottom or necessary repairs, in such a\r\ncase, would be so unfriendly to Great Britain, that it may well be\r\ndoubted if any neighboring neutral nation would allow them.\r\n\r\nCommerce-destroying by independent cruisers depends upon wide\r\ndissemination of force. Commerce-destroying through control of a\r\nstrategic centre by a great fleet depends upon concentration of force.\r\nRegarded as a primary, not as a secondary, operation, the former is\r\ncondemned, the latter justified, by the experience of centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alberoni_, Cardinal, minister to Philip V. of Spain, 233;\r\n  naval and general policy of, 234-236;\r\n  failure of his schemes, 238;\r\n  dismissed, 239.\r\n\r\n_Anson_, British Admiral, expedition to the Pacific, 261;\r\n  captures a French squadron, 271.\r\n\r\n_Arbuthnot_, British Admiral, engagement with French fleet off the\r\n  Chesapeake, 385-387.\r\n\r\n_Armed Neutrality_, the, of the Baltic powers, 405.\r\n\r\n_Arnold_, Benedict, treason of, 382;\r\n  expedition to James River, 385.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Barbadoes_, strategic value of, 348, 393, 518;\r\n  ineffectual attempt of the French against, 469.\r\n\r\n_Barrington_, British Admiral, energy of, 365;\r\n  takes Sta.
