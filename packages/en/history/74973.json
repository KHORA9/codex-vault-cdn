Not\r\n only for the interest of a biography, but for arriving at the inside\r\n of things the publication of letters is the true method. Biographers\r\n varnish, they assign motives, they conjecture feelings, they interpret\r\n Lord Burleigh’s nods, but contemporary letters are facts._”--Dr.\r\n Newman to his Sister, Mrs. John Mozley, _May 18, 1863_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nLORENZO DI PIERO DE MEDICI.\r\n\r\n_From a picture at Poggio a Caiano._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LIVES OF\r\n                            THE EARLY MEDICI\r\n\r\n                            AS TOLD IN THEIR\r\n                             CORRESPONDENCE\r\n\r\n                         TRANSLATED & EDITED BY\r\n\r\n                               JANET ROSS\r\n\r\n                             [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                    WITH 12 PORTRAITS AND FACSIMILES\r\n\r\n                                 LONDON\r\n                            CHATTO & WINDUS\r\n                                  1910\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _All rights reserved_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nMany a book has been written about the Medici; yet how little has been\r\nsaid about the private lives of the founders of that wonderful family\r\nwhich rose from prosperous middle-class condition to take its place\r\namong the sovereign houses of Europe, to seat its daughters on the\r\nthrone of the Queen-consorts of France, and its sons on the Chair of\r\nSt. Peter? Their rival capitalists north of the Alps climbed high in\r\nthose days when the gulf was dug deep between nobles and all who were\r\nbelow them in the social scale. The Fuggers made many alliances with\r\nthe German and Bohemian nobles, and the Welsers had the unheard-of\r\nglory of mating one of their daughters with the Emperor of Germany;\r\ndoes not the Philipine-Welser Strasse in Augsburg commemorate to this\r\nday the renown of the match? But neither had the fortune to found a\r\ndynasty as did the Medici. They are so inseparably connected with the\r\nhistory of their native city that the biographies have insensibly\r\nbecome sketches of Florentine, even of European history. The men and\r\nwomen have disappeared, and we see instead the dexterous manipulators\r\nof tortuous Italian diplomacy, or the splendid patrons of art and\r\nliterature during the best period of the Renaissance. Yet, in our day,\r\nwe sometimes like to turn aside from the stage life to learn about the\r\n_vie intime_ of personages who have become historical. We are curious\r\nabout their doings within the home circle, about their private loves\r\nand hates, whether they were good or bad husbands and wives, parents\r\nand children. The simpler human interests attract us.\r\n\r\nThis book attempts to supply such details. It is founded on letters,\r\nfor the most part private, of Medici men, women, and children, and\r\ntheir friends, written during those decades when the family was being\r\nmoulded for the great European destiny which lay hidden in the future\r\nbefore it. In these old-world epistles Contessina artlessly displays\r\nher household economies, Lucrezia reveals her fondness for bathing,\r\nClarice quarrels with no less a tutor than the celebrated Poliziano\r\nabout the lessons he gave to her children, and the child Piero tells\r\nhis father how he has studied hard, even writing in Latin, “in order to\r\ngive a more literary tone to my letters,” and proudly and persistently\r\ndemands the pony promised as a reward for diligence.\r\n\r\nThe materials have been gathered from many a quarter. Angelo Fabroni’s\r\nponderous tomes, _Magni Cosmi Medicei Vita_ and _Laurentii Medicis\r\nMagnifici Vita_; the Histories of Florence by Giovanni Cavalcanti,\r\nGiovanni Cambi, and Niccolὸ Machiavelli; rare pamphlets, published in\r\nsmall editions of twenty-five or a hundred copies, by Italian men of\r\nletters in honour of the marriage of some friend, which are a mine of\r\nwealth; and last, but not least, the Florentine Archives. Most of the\r\nletters from the _Archivio Medicei ante Principato_ have never been\r\npublished before, much less translated; others are given here in full,\r\nwhich have hitherto seen the light only in very fragmentary form.\r\nThe volume can therefore claim to contain a great deal of thoroughly\r\noriginal matter. In them it will be seen that well-born or important\r\nmen and women were addressed as Your Magnificence, and written to and\r\nspoken of as The Magnificent. It was, therefore, no special title\r\nbestowed on Lorenzo de’ Medici, but suiting so well with his character\r\nand whole personality it has become, as it were, his property.\r\n\r\nMy best thanks are due to Cavaliere Angelo Bruschi, librarian of the\r\nMarucelliana Library in Florence, without whose valid assistance and\r\nadvice I should have had great difficulty in collecting the letters;\r\nto Dr. Dorini of the Florentine Archives, whose aid was invaluable in\r\nhelping me to decipher the almost illegible manuscripts; and to Signor\r\nGugliemo Volpi, several of whose pamphlets and articles are quoted. I\r\nmust also thank the Baroness Mollinary of Como for so kindly having\r\nphotographed for me her most interesting early portrait of Lorenzo\r\nthe Magnificent, never before published; and Dr. Giovanni Poggi,\r\ndirector of the Bargello in Florence, for giving me the photograph\r\nof Lorenzo’s portrait at Poggio a Caiano. The Baroness Mollinary’s\r\npicture is one of the many that belonged to her ancestor Paolo Giovio,\r\nand bears a strong resemblance to the fine miniature of Lorenzo, the\r\nproperty of M. Prosper Villon, reproduced in _Le Musée de Portraits\r\nde Paul Jove_ by M. Eugène Muntz, in which, however, Lorenzo looks\r\nrather older. Both show the same humorous, kindly face, with a strong\r\nmouth, determined jaw, and fine eyes. In the miniature the head and\r\nshoulders are against and under a baldaquin, on each side of which is a\r\nsmall bit of landscape. Below is inscribed _Laur M P P_ and the Medici\r\narms (with six balls), surmounted by Lorenzo’s device, three ostrich\r\nfeathers, white, green, and red (faith, hope, and charity), while\r\na floating ribbon behind bears his motto _Semper_. The portrait at\r\nPoggio a Caiano is perhaps by Alessandro Allori, therefore of course\r\nnot contemporary; it may be a copy of an older and lost picture. I\r\nmust also express my great gratitude to the Rev. Principal Lindsay of\r\nGlasgow for kind help and criticism during the progress of my work.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Piero de’ Medici in the chapel of the Riccardi palace,\r\nby Benozzo Gozzoli, has been given sometimes as that of his father\r\nCosimo, or even of his son Lorenzo. But if the bust by Mino da Fiesole,\r\nin the Bargello, represents Piero, then he is the man grasping his\r\nhorse’s mane with one hand as he rides by the side of his father\r\nCosimo, who, as we know, generally rode a mule.\r\n\r\n                                                             JANET ROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n INTRODUCTORY                                                          1\r\n\r\n COSIMO DI GIOVANNI DE’ MEDICI (1389-1464)                             7\r\n\r\n Contessina de’ Medici to her husband Cosimo in Ferrara               10\r\n\r\n Cosimo de’ Medici to Averardo de’ Medici, Ambassador\r\n to Ferrara                                                           11\r\n\r\n Contessina de’ Medici to her son Giovanni at Ferrara                 14\r\n\r\n Cosimo de’ Medici to Averardo de’ Medici at Pisa                     15\r\n\r\n Cosimo de’ Medici to Averardo de’ Medici                             16\r\n\r\n Cosimo de’ Medici at Florence to Averardo de’ Medici\r\n at Pisa                                                              18\r\n\r\n Diary of Cosimo de’ Medici and his Oration to the\r\n Signory of Florence when sentence of exile was\r\n pronounced against him                                               19\r\n\r\n Cosimo de’ Medici to his son Piero de’ Medici                        31\r\n\r\n Niccolò Fortebraccio to Cosimo de’ Medici and Neri di\r\n Gino Capponi                                                         34\r\n\r\n Lorenzo de’ Medici to his brother Cosimo, Ambassador\r\n to Ferrara, in the name of the “Dieci di Balia”                      35\r\n\r\n Count Francesco Sforza to Cosimo de’ Medici                          36\r\n\r\n Count Francesco Sforza to Cosimo de’ Medici                          38\r\n\r\n Count Francesco Sforza to Cosimo de’ Medici                          39\r\n\r\n Contessina de’ Medici to her son Piero                               40\r\n\r\n Commissio Laurentii de’ Medicis, 3 Decembris 1438                    42\r\n\r\n Additio facta Commissioni Laurentii de’ Medicis                      43\r\n\r\n Francesco Sforza to Cosimo de’ Medici                                44\r\n\r\n Contessina de’ Medici to her son Giovanni at the Baths\r\n of Petriolo [near Siena]                                             46\r\n\r\n Alberto Averardo de’ Alberti, from Rome, to Giovanni\r\n de’ Medici                                                           47\r\n\r\n Contessina de’ Medici to her son Giovanni in Rome                    47\r\n\r\n The Same to the Same                                                 48\r\n\r\n Contessina de’ Medici to her son Piero                               48\r\n\r\n Lucrezia de’ Medici, at the Baths of Petriolo;

The\r\nlatter declare they sprang from the very dregs of the people, and that\r\na charcoal-burner in the Mugello was their progenitor, whose son was a\r\ndoctor (_medico_). Their friends say they descend from Perseus, from\r\na Roman consul, or even from an emperor. Others state that a brave\r\nknight, Averardo de’ Medici, came into Italy with Charlemagne and\r\nkilled the fierce giant Mugello, who for years had kept Tuscany in\r\nbondage; while those who cling to the _medico_ story, on account of the\r\nname, tell of a learned physician who saved the life of Charlemagne by\r\napplying cupping-glasses of his own invention. The well-known arms,\r\nsix red balls on a field or, are accounted for in as many different\r\nways. Doctors’ pills, cupping-glasses, apples from the gardens of the\r\nHesperides, dents made by the giant’s mace on Averardo’s golden shield,\r\nand heads of enemies slain in battle by a valiant knight who killed\r\neleven of his assailants, because the oldest shield of the Medici bore\r\neleven balls.\r\n\r\nAccording to genealogists the real progenitor of the Medici was a\r\ncertain Giambuono. He appears to have been a priest, as is indicated in\r\nan ancient inscription on the wall of the church of the Assumption near\r\nS. Piero a Sieve in the Mugello. What is certain is that the family\r\nowned houses and towers in Florence in the twelfth century in the\r\nPiazza de’ Medici, afterwards called de’ Succhiellinai, near the church\r\nof S. Tommaso, which was in the Ghetto, now swept away. There a little\r\ninn, Del Porco, used to be pointed out as standing where once was the\r\nloggia of the family.\r\n\r\nWe have historical proof of the brothers Chiarissimo and Bonagiunta\r\nde’ Medici, descendants of Giambuono. Chiarissimo was a member of the\r\ncouncil which made an alliance with the Sienese against Semifonte in\r\nthe Val d’Elsa, when that strong castle was razed to the ground in\r\n1201. Ardingo, a great-grandson of Bonagiunta, was the first of the\r\nfamily to hold high office in Florence. He became Prior of the city in\r\n1291, Gonfalonier of Justice in 1296, and again in the following year.\r\nThis proves decisively that the Medici were not of the old nobility,\r\nwhich had been excluded from all magisterial offices by a law passed in\r\n1293, called the _Ordinamenti della Giustizia_, which Bonaini terms the\r\nMagna Charta of the Republic of Florence.[1] Ardingo’s brother Guccio,\r\nwho was Gonfalonier in 1299, made himself so popular that when he died\r\nhe was buried with great pomp in a sarcophagus of the fourth century,\r\nwhich stood outside the baptistery. Later it was removed into the\r\ncathedral, and in the eighteenth century was placed in the courtyard of\r\nPalazzo Riccardi (once Medici), where it still is. The cover, bearing\r\nthe Medici arms and those of the Arte della Lana, or Guild of Wool, to\r\nwhich Guccio belonged, was made by order of the Priors at the time of\r\nhis burial.\r\n\r\nIn 1314 another of the family, Averardo, was Gonfalonier of Justice,\r\nand one of his grandsons, Filigno di Conte de’ Medici, has left\r\n_Ricordi_, or Memoirs, written in 1373, which show how rich and\r\ninfluential the Medici had already become. The book, which still exists\r\nin the Florentine archives, was evidently once bound in vellum; the\r\nfrontispiece is decorated with the Medici arms, six red balls on a\r\nfield or, and the shield is surmounted by the head and paws of a black\r\nwolf rising out of what looks like the coronet of a modern Marquess.\r\n\r\nAddressing his children he writes:\r\n\r\n“In the name of God and of his blessed Mother Madonna Saint Mary, and\r\nof the whole Court of Paradise, who will I pray give us grace to act\r\nand to speak well.\r\n\r\n“I, Filigno di Conte de’ Medici, seeing the late misfortunes of civil\r\nand foreign wars and the terrible mortality from the plague sent by\r\nour Lord God to this earth, which we fear he may send again as our\r\nneighbours have it, will write down the things I see which may be\r\nneedful for you who remain or who come after me, so that you can find\r\nthem if need be for any emergency. I pray you to write well in the\r\nfuture and to preserve those lands and houses which you will find\r\ninscribed in this book; most of them were bought by the noble knight\r\nMesser Giovanni di Conte, my brother of honoured memory, after whose\r\ndeath I began to write this book, taking from his records and from\r\nthose of others. I beg you will take care of it and keep it in a secret\r\nplace so that it may not fall into other hands, also because it may\r\nbe necessary to you in the future as it is now to us, who have to\r\nfind papers of one hundred years ago, for reasons which you will find\r\nwritten, because States change and have no durability.\r\n\r\n“Also I beg of you to preserve not only the riches but the position\r\nattained by our ancestors, which is considerable but ought to be\r\nhigher. It begins to decline on account of a dearth of capable men, of\r\nwhom we once had many.\r\n\r\n“Such was our greatness that it used to be said, ‘Thou art like one of\r\nthe Medici,’ and every man feared us; even now when a citizen does an\r\ninjury to another or abuses him, they say, ‘If he did thus to a Medici\r\nwhat would happen?’ Our family is still powerful in the State by reason\r\nof many friends and much riches, please God preserve it all to us. And\r\nto-day, thank God, we number about fifty men.\r\n\r\n“Since I was born about one hundred of our men have died; there are\r\nbut few families and we are badly off for children, that is to say\r\nthere are few. I write this book in several parts. First I shall note\r\ncertain facts which are useful to know, then the dowers and as many\r\npapers as I can collect, the bills of sale and such like, then all the\r\npurchases and who drew up the deeds, and then all the houses and lands\r\nwe possess....”\r\n\r\nPage 84 is interesting as showing where the houses of the Medici stood\r\nin Florence, and also that Cafaggiuolo belonged to them in early times.\r\n\r\n“In the name of God amen.\r\n\r\n“Here I inscribe all our lands and their boundaries and where they are\r\nsituated, and the houses in Florence, and what possessions came to us\r\nfrom Conte our father in the division made between the brothers (that\r\nis the late Conte, Messer Jacopo, Messer Giovenco the knight, Talento,\r\nFrancesco and Chiarissimo) of the inheritance of their father Averardo,\r\nthose bought by Conte and also those bought by Messer Giovanni di\r\nConte, knight, together with myself Filigno, and Jacopo and Michele,\r\nour brothers, during their life. To-day I begin to write and to cause\r\nMichele my son also to write on account of the fatigue, and of not\r\nbeing a good penman. God grant we do well.--1373, in February.\r\n\r\n“A house with shops in front in the parish of S. Tommaso in the Mercato\r\nVecchio in Florence; the first side fronts the street or rather the\r\nMercato Vecchio, the second boundary is ours, the third is the street\r\nwherein stands S. Tommaso, the fourth is Talento di Chiarissimo de’\r\nMedici and ourselves. Adjoining this house are two others, three\r\nsmaller ones and several shops.... Also a palace with a courtyard, an\r\norchard and a well, in the parish of S. Lorenzo of Florence, in Via\r\nLarga di S. Marco. The confines are first the said street; secondly\r\nthe sons of Tantini with a common wall between us, saving that what is\r\nabove their roof belongs to us and to Baglo di Dante, with the wall of\r\nour courtyard below; the third is the inn of the Cock, now the property\r\nof Niccolò di Cristofano di Geri Gazza, &c.; the fourth is the palace\r\nof Andrea Franceschi and Francesco di Biccio de’ Medici. A house is\r\nannexed to this palace....\r\n\r\n“In the name of God amen. Possessions in Mugello.\r\n\r\n“The half of a palace with houses around it, a courtyard, a loggia\r\nand a wall and moat, with an orchard outside in Cafaggiuolo in the\r\nparish of S. Giovanni in Petroio, with the sixth part of the interior\r\ncourtyard, and the old walls, and all other things pertaining thereto\r\nthat are in the division. The broad road is to be 7 feet 8 inches wide\r\nround the old enclosure of Cafaggiuolo, so that the sons of Messer\r\nGiovenco cannot prevent us from using the road in front of the palace\r\nand by their wall, as far as the bridge. The moat round Cafaggiuolo is\r\nentirely ours as it touches our walls.”[2]\r\n\r\nA cousin of Filigno, Salvestro de’ Medici, led the Florentine troops\r\nagainst Giovanni Visconti, Archbishop and Lord of Milan, and was\r\nknighted on the battlefield of Scarperia. Gonfalonier of Justice in\r\n1370, when Florence was distracted by the rivalry of the Guelphs\r\nand Ghibellines, he, being a Ghibelline, took the side of the people\r\nagainst the nobles, and advocated enforcing the enactments of the\r\n_Ordinamenti della Giustizia_, which excluded the nobles from power.\r\nBut for the moment he failed, and was nigh being exiled when his name\r\nwas again drawn from the _borsa_, or ballot-bag, as Gonfalonier in\r\n1378. Once more he proposed to apply the law against the Guelph nobles,\r\nand meeting with opposition, threatened to resign. One of his friends\r\nthen appealed to the populace, and the result was the Ciompi riot. The\r\nmob broke into the Palazzo de’ Priori and the Palazzo del Podestà,\r\nburnt many palaces, and knighted sixty-four citizens in the Piazza\r\ndella Signoria, of whom Salvestro was the first.\r\n\r\nHis popularity is shown by a sonnet addressed to him by Franco\r\nSacchetti, author of many tales, who rather profanely calls him “non\r\ngia Salvestro, ma Salvator mundi.” Salvestro was, however, a canny\r\nburgher and made some profit out of the revolution, as the rents of\r\nthe shops on the Ponte Vecchio were assigned to him. Henceforward the\r\nMedici were looked upon as the friends and defenders of the people\r\nagainst the _Grandi_ or nobles.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the line of citizens who ruled Florence like princes\r\nwas Giovanni d’Averardo, surnamed Bicci, de’ Medici, born in 1360. He\r\nwas several times a Prior, and in 1421 Gonfalonier of Justice. During\r\nthe Councils of Basel and Constance he made a fortune in exchange,\r\nand being charitable was much beloved by the people. His popularity\r\nincreased when, against his advice, the nobles insisted on advancing\r\nto meet the Duke of Milan instead of waiting for him to attack them in\r\nTuscany, with the result that at Zagonara the Florentines were beaten.\r\nThe expenses of the war exhausted the treasury, and disturbances\r\nbroke out in Florence. The nobles, fearing a repetition of the Ciompi\r\nriots, attempted to form a government of _Ottimati_, as the party\r\nof the oligarchy were called, and thus undermine the power of the\r\nminor guilds. Some even suggested seizing the property of charitable\r\nconfraternities in order to obtain money. Giovanni de’ Medici was\r\nconsulted, and declared he would have nothing to do with such robbery.\r\nA few years later he successfully advocated the abolition of the odious\r\nsystem of forced loans, and the institution of the _catasto_, which\r\nregulated all the taxes to be paid to the Commune of Florence. He\r\nthen became the idol of the people. Cavalcanti writes that when he lay\r\ndying on 20th February 1429, “he called his sons Cosimo and Lorenzo,\r\nand in the presence of their mother, Piccarda Bueri, of their wives,\r\nand of other citizens, spoke to them thus: ‘Beloved sons, neither\r\nI nor any man born into this world should feel grief at exchanging\r\nworldly cares for perpetual repose. I know that the last days of my\r\nlife are nigh, and where timid or foolish women or cowardly men would\r\nfeel sorrow, I feel great joy. I leave you in possession of the great\r\nwealth which my good fortune has bestowed upon me, and which your good\r\nmother and my own hard work has enabled me to preserve. I leave you\r\nwith a larger business than any other merchant in the Tuscan land, and\r\nin the enjoyment of the esteem of every good citizen and of the great\r\nmass of the populace, who have ever turned to our family as to their\r\nguiding star. If you are faithful to the traditions of your ancestors,\r\nthe people will be generous in giving you honours. To achieve this, be\r\ncharitable to the poor, kindly and gracious to the miserable, lending\r\nyourselves with all your might to assist them in their adversity. Never\r\nstrive against the will of the people, unless they advocate a baneful\r\nproject. Speak not as though giving advice, but rather discuss matters\r\nwith gentle and kindly reasoning. Be chary of frequenting the Palace;\r\nrather wait to be summoned, and then be obedient, and not puffed up\r\nwith pride at receiving many votes. Have a care to keep the people\r\nat peace, and to increase the commerce of the city. Avoid litigation\r\nor any attempt to influence justice, for whoso impedes justice will\r\nperish by justice. I leave you clear of any stain, for no evil deed\r\nhas been committed by me. Thus I bequeath glory and not infamy to you\r\nas a heritage. I depart joyfully and with more happiness if you do not\r\nenter into party strife. Be careful not to attract public attention. I\r\ncommend to you Nannina my wife and your mother, see that after my death\r\nye change not the habits and customs of her life. Pray to God for me,\r\nmy sons, that my passage may be crowned by the salvation of my immortal\r\nsoul. Now take my blessing. Cosimo, see that Lorenzo be kindly and a\r\ngood brother; and thou, Lorenzo, honour Cosimo as the elder.’ Saying\r\nthis, he passed from this life.”[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCOSIMO DI GIOVANNI DE’ MEDICI.\r\n\r\n_From the marble relief by Andrea Del Verrocchio (?) in the Kaiser\r\nFriedrich Museum, Berlin._]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] For an account of the _Ordinamenti della Giustizia_ see _I Primi\r\nSecoli della Storia di Firenze_, chap. viii.

Firenze, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSIMO DI GIOVANNI DE’ MEDICI\r\n\r\n(1389-1464)\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Giovanni di Bicci de’ Medici’s two sons, Cosimo was by far the most\r\nremarkable. “The father,” writes Gibbon, “of a line of princes, whose\r\nname and age are almost synonymous with the restoration of learning;\r\nhis credit was ennobled into fame; his riches were dedicated to the\r\nservice of mankind; he corresponded at once with Cairo and London, and\r\na cargo of Indian spices and Greek books were often imported in the\r\nsame vessel.” For even when most deeply engaged in political matters,\r\nCosimo always found time to attend to his business, and himself\r\nconducted the correspondence with the heads of the banks which were\r\nknown throughout Europe and in Asia. All had orders to buy ancient\r\nmanuscripts and rare books. As a lad he served in the Pisan war, and\r\nin 1414 was sent by his father in the suite of Pope John XXIII. to\r\nrepresent the bank at the Council of Constance. After the flight of the\r\nPope, Cosimo left Constance in disguise and returned to Florence, where\r\nhe was elected a Prior of the city in 1415, and again in 1417.\r\n\r\nCosimo was forty when his father died in 1429. Ammirato describes\r\nhim as of middle height, with an olive complexion, and of imposing\r\npresence. Machiavelli says that he applied himself so strenuously to\r\nincrease the political power of his house that “those who had rejoiced\r\nat Giovanni’s death, now regretted it, perceiving what manner of man\r\nCosimo was. Of consummate prudence, staid yet agreeable presence,\r\nCosimo was liberal and humane. He never worked against his party nor\r\nagainst the State, was prompt in giving aid to all, and his liberality\r\ngained him many partisans among the citizens. Chief amongst those\r\nwho helped to consolidate his power were Averardo de’ Medici and\r\nPuccio Pucci--Averardo by his audacity, Puccio by his prudence and\r\nsagacity, augmented his popularity and greatness. The advice and the\r\nsane judgment of Puccio were so highly esteemed and so well known\r\nby all that Cosimo’s party was not called by his name but by that of\r\nPuccio.”[4]\r\n\r\nMuch of Cosimo’s influence and popularity, no doubt, arose from his\r\ngenerosity to men of letters. When Niccolò de’ Niccoli, “censor of\r\nthe Latin tongue,” ruined himself by buying books, Cosimo opened an\r\nunlimited credit for him at his bank. After Niccoli’s death he paid his\r\ndebts on the condition of being allowed to dispose of the collection of\r\nmanuscripts, amounting to six hundred volumes. Four hundred he gave to\r\nthe library of S. Marco, the rest he kept or distributed among friends.\r\nCosimo also provided Tommaso Parentucelli, Bishop of Bologna, with what\r\nmoney he needed; a service that was well repaid when the Bishop became\r\nPope, and made him his banker. Parentucelli catalogued de’ Niccoli’s\r\nlibrary, and noted for Cosimo the books that were necessary to complete\r\nit. This catalogue Vespasiano declared to be indispensable to all\r\ncollectors of books. When the Badia of Fiesole, certainly designed, if\r\nnot actually built by Brunelleschi at Cosimo’s expense, was finished,\r\nhe summoned Vespasiano, who has recorded their conversation: “One day,\r\nwhen I was in his room, he said to me, ‘What plan can you suggest for\r\nthe formation of this library?’ I answered that to buy the books would\r\nbe impossible, since they could not be purchased. ‘What, then, do you\r\npropose?’ he added. I told him they must be copied. He then asked me\r\nif I would undertake the business, and I replied that I was willing.\r\nHe bade me begin at my leisure, saying that he left all to me, and he\r\nordered that for the money needed day by day Don Arcangelo, at that\r\ntime Prior of the monastery, should draw cheques upon his bank which\r\nwould be honoured. After beginning the collection, since it was his\r\nwill that it should be finished with all speed possible, and money was\r\nnot lacking, I soon engaged forty-five copyists, and in twenty-two\r\nmonths provided two hundred volumes, following the admirable list\r\nfurnished by Pope Nicholas V.”[5]\r\n\r\nCristofano Landino, Lionardo Aretino (Bruni), whose translations from\r\nthe Greek were celebrated for their pure latinity, while his speeches\r\nwere compared to those of Pericles, and Carlo Aretino (Marsuppini),\r\nwere friends of Cosimo, and members of the Platonic Academy. They\r\noften met in the Badia, and Pico della Mirandola, on whom, says\r\nPoliziano, “nature seems to have showered all her gifts,” passed\r\nsome time there in study. In the cell of Ambrogio Traversari in the\r\nconvent degl’ Angeli at Fiesole, Cosimo was wont to pass his spare\r\nhours in the company of learned men. He was quick in recognising\r\ntalent, and possessed the gift said to belong to royalty of suiting his\r\nconversation to his visitors. Vespasiano tells us that “when giving\r\naudience to a scholar he discoursed concerning letters; in the company\r\nof theologians he showed his acquaintance with theology, a branch of\r\nlearning always studied by him with delight. So also with regard to\r\nphilosophy. Astrologers found him well versed in their science, for he\r\nsomewhat lent faith to astrology, and employed it on certain private\r\noccasions. Musicians in like manner perceived his mastery of music,\r\nwherein he much delighted. The same was true about sculpture and\r\npainting; both of these arts he understood completely, and showed great\r\nfavour to all worthy craftsmen. In architecture he was a consummate\r\njudge, for without his opinion and advice no building was begun or\r\ncarried to completion.”[6]\r\n\r\nWhile spending money in a princely manner on works of art, public\r\nlibraries and buildings, Cosimo lived as simply as any other citizen.\r\nThough for twenty-five years he was practically the ruler of Florence,\r\nhe remained the merchant, the plain burgher, the agriculturist.\r\nHis estates were in good order; he superintended the planting, and\r\nrose early to prune his vines. Gambling he detested; the only game\r\nhe played, and that but rarely, was chess. Habitually taciturn,\r\nparticularly in his later years, yet he could give witty and even sharp\r\nanswers; as when one of his adherents, a loquacious, not very wise man,\r\nwho, on being named Podestà of a foreign (_i.e._ not a Tuscan) town,\r\nasked him for advice. “Dress suitably and talk little,” was the answer.\r\nTo another he said there was a weed that ought not to be watered but\r\nallowed to wither, and that weed was envy.\r\n\r\nIn Cosimo’s letters one sees how well his father’s last words, “Be\r\ncareful not to attract public attention,” were obeyed by him. The pity\r\nis that even those who pass their lives poring over manuscripts in the\r\nFlorentine archives find the greatest difficulty in deciphering his\r\nhandwriting, and there are allusions to passing events or to people\r\nwhich are impossible to understand, as he uses the _gergo_, or slang,\r\nof his day, or nicknames, the meaning of which are lost to us. The date\r\nof his marriage with Contessina, daughter of Giovanni de’ Bardi, Count\r\nof Vernio, is not recorded, but her eldest son, Piero, was born in\r\n1416. The little we know of her, chiefly from her letters, depict her\r\nas a good, rather parsimonious housewife and a tender mother. In 1427\r\nCosimo was at Ferrara, and she writes:\r\n\r\n\r\nContessina de’ Medici _to her husband_ Cosimo de’ Medici _in Ferrara_\r\n\r\n This evening I have a letter from thee and have understood how much\r\n we are to pay for the barrels at Careggi; as soon as they arrive I\r\n will do as thou sayest. I have a letter from Antonio Martelli saying\r\n that he is sending nine bales of our linen cloth, which were at home,\r\n by now I think they must have arrived, give orders that they be put\r\n in a dry place so that the linen be not spoiled. At Careggi every one\r\n is well as usual and I am also well, may it please God that it be so\r\n in the future; one of our labourers it is true, who lives where the\r\n young partridges were, rather frightened us, but he is well again. I\r\n wrote to thee by Giovannino, so be not chary with ink and paper, so\r\n be it is not wearisome to thee. Ginevra and Pier Francesco[7] are in\r\n the Val d’Arno and Amerigo Cavalcanti is with them. They are all well\r\n as Giovannino will have told thee. Lorenzo[8] and I are here, both\r\n well. Shouldst thou want anything let me know. Above all be careful of\r\n thy health and keep a good watch on thyself. No more at present. May\r\n Christ preserve thee.--In Florence, March 4, 1427 (1428).\r\n\r\n La Contessina who commends herself to thee.\r\n\r\n Matteo gave me the little keys, if thou hast need of them tell\r\n me. Thy mother who put that Santelena[9] into the bag with the others\r\n thou hadst from here is much surprised that thou hast not found\r\n it, she remembers to a certainty putting it into the bag the first\r\n thing after thy departure. She wrote to-day and answered about this.\r\n Those who were in debt for their rents have paid to Piero d’Orlando\r\n according to Lorenzo’s orders.[10]\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written during the negotiations for peace with\r\nVisconti, Duke of Milan. Florence and Genoa had fared badly in the\r\nwar. The former had been defeated over and over again, and the whole\r\nof the Western Riviera had been overrun by the Milanese troops. The\r\ninterference of Venice had changed the state of affairs, and the Duke\r\nof Milan was desirous for peace. Averardo de’ Medici with Palla Strozzi\r\nwere the ambassadors of Florence, and Cosimo discusses the difficulties\r\nattending the negotiation. The Florentines thought that Venice was too\r\ngrasping, as she demanded Bergamo as well as Brescia; but the real\r\ncrux of the problem was that the Duke of Milan held tenaciously to his\r\nconquests in the Riviera. Peace was finally concluded on April 28,\r\n1428. The Cardinal di Santa Croce had been appointed by the Pope as\r\narbiter between the parties. Part of the letter refers to Florentine\r\ninternal politics, to which now we have no clue; we also see how these\r\ngreat Florentines mingled their private mercantile affairs with grave\r\npolitical matters.\r\n\r\n Non ò tue lettere poi ti scrissi per una vostra de dì 29 currente\r\n viddi e dubj v’ erano in animo veduto le diferenze sono nella domanda\r\n et chome dite è da dubitare non tanto per le diferenze quanto\r\n perché si vede el ducha non viene schietto su questi ragionamenti,\r\n pure vorrei voi vi fossi ingiegnati sendire che diferenza è questa\r\n et maxime de fatti di Berghamo e che inporta et chosì quelle di\r\n Valchamonicha la quale a me pare picchola se altro non v’è aschosto\r\n et poi le chose sono ridotte qui non si vorebe per si picchola chosa\r\n tanto bene restasse et pero credo v’ingiegnerete a rottura non si\r\n vengha et chosì si vuole fare et vedere se di queste diferenze si\r\n potesse fare remissione nel chardinale chome de l’altre sarebe tanto\r\n magiore lo schorno se a rottura si venisse quanto per ognuno si tiene\r\n a certo pace deba seghuire fu qui jeri Franceschino da Macerata et\r\n secondo da lui ritrassi non pareva avesse nuova se di questo fatto si\r\n facesse questo dicho per tuo aviso che mi fa assai dubitare benchè\r\n jo creda pure che chostì di cò a dire chon el chardinale per suo\r\n interesso dovria farne ogni chosa posibile ✕ de fatti delli grani\r\n chome per altra ti dissi non te ne gravare troppo in confortare perchè\r\n n’aresti graveza et per ire chosì ci è chommodo Ser p. el chompare\r\n che altra volta non se ne faceva menzione e ora sta chosì forte et\r\n acordasi il chonpare e’lla chomare nonn è però che per questo si\r\n volgla laschare nulla adrieto nè qui anche si lascerebe ma stimasi\r\n sendo d’achordo de l’altre chose per questa sola non vorebe rimanesse\r\n et forse questo medesimo stima el chonpagno ora Idio ne lasci seghuire\r\n el meglio de fati de’ Bordoni che si mandi fiorini 24 per lane a le\r\n gienti di Lomb e chosì di nuovo mandi a quelli di Riviera e rimettonsi\r\n in punto tutti e chosì subito passato pasqua si manderà i resto in\r\n modo potranno scrivere e simile al marchese credo se si fosse fatto\r\n già è un mese sariano in migliore disposizione le chose non sono.\r\n\r\n Di verso Gienova cì è la cho[sa] prospere sechondo usanza pure invero\r\n credo abino assai travaglo anno di nuovo perso uno chastello tra\r\n Gienova et Saona et chosì tutta quelle riviera di ponente è in arme\r\n et non v’è dubio se si facesse quello si potrebe quella terra se li\r\n leverebe ma meglo sarebe a non ne avere a fare prouva.\r\n\r\n Ne piu per fretta ✕^o ti ghuardi in Firenze a dì primo d’Aprile 1428.\r\n\r\n                                                            Chosimo.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCosimo de’ Medici to Averardo de’ Medici, _Ambassador to Ferrara_\r\n\r\n I have not had any letter from you since I wrote. By yours of the 29th\r\n I saw the doubt in your mind seeing the difference in the demand, and\r\n as you say there is reason for suspicion, not so much on account of\r\n the differences as because it is evident the Duke [of Milan] is not\r\n straightforward in this matter, so I wish you to try and discover what\r\n the difference is, especially about these affairs at Bergamo and what\r\n they mean, and also those of Valcamonica, which seem to me of small\r\n account unless there is something concealed. As matters stand here,\r\n one would not desire to move for so small a thing, and so I trust\r\n you will do your utmost to prevent a rupture; we shall do the like,\r\n and see whether it is not possible to refer these differences to the\r\n Cardinal [di Santa Croce] like the others. The shame would be great to\r\n fall out just when every one expects peace to be made. Franceschino\r\n of Macerata was here yesterday, and from what I could gather had not\r\n heard what was to be done in this affair; this I tell you for your\r\n guidance, as it seems to me very suspicious, although I think the\r\n Cardinal for his own interest will do all that is possible. About the\r\n wheat business, as I said in my last, do not overburden yourself, else\r\n you will have trouble; as it is, it has been a convenience. Ser P.,\r\n the godfather,[12] of whom there was no mention last time, is now in\r\n a strong position, and godfather and godmother are united. This is,\r\n however, no reason for neglecting to take precautions, and we shall\r\n take them; but as we are agreed about other matters, we do not wish\r\n to draw back on this point alone, and perhaps our companion thinks\r\n the same. Now let God lead us on the right path. As to the affairs\r\n of Bordoni, let 24 florins be sent for the wool to the people of\r\n Lombardy, and send again to those of the Riviera, thus setting all in\r\n order; and directly after Easter the rest shall be sent, so that the\r\n same can be written to the Marquess. I think if this had been done a\r\n month ago, things would be in a better condition than they are now.\r\n\r\n Towards Genoa things go on as usual, although I think they are hard\r\n pressed; they have again lost a castle between Genoa and Savona, so\r\n that all the western Riviera is under arms, and there is no doubt that\r\n were we to do what we could do the province would rebel, but it is\r\n better not to put it to the proof. I write no more, as I am pressed\r\n for time. Christ guard you.--In Florence on the 1st day of April 1428.\r\n\r\n                                                             Cosimo.[13]\r\n\r\nThe letters written by Cosimo de’ Medici to his cousin Averardo de’\r\nMedici, in October and November of 1430 and February of 1431, relate to\r\nthe costly and disastrous war waged against Lucca, and require a few\r\nexplanatory sentences.\r\n\r\nThe war was proposed to the Commune of Florence by the impetuous\r\nyoung leader of the aristocratic party in the city, and Cosimo, who\r\nafter the death of his father Giovanni was the recognised head of the\r\ndemocracy, supported the proposals of his opponent and rival, Rinaldo\r\ndegl’ Albizzi. The war was popular. The Florentines believed that they\r\nhad secured the acquiescence of the Duke of Milan and of the Pope. All\r\nthings seemed to favour them (letter of February). The plan of the\r\nFlorentine generals in the field was to starve Lucca into surrender\r\nby seizing on the districts of Camaiore and Pietrasanta, whence the\r\nLucchesi drew their supplies. The “Ten of the Balìa” or Florentine war\r\ncommittee countermanded this prudent plan of campaign and their troops\r\ncould effect nothing against Lucca. The Lucchesi were hard pressed,\r\nhowever, and appealed to the Duke of Milan. He permitted Francesco\r\nSforza to take service under Lucca, and that great general soon reduced\r\nthe Florentines to extremities. In their need they resolved to bribe\r\nSforza, and on receiving 50,000 florins he abandoned the Lucchesi. The\r\n“tyrant” of Lucca, Paolo Guinigi, was overthrown; the city became a\r\nRepublic, and sued for peace. But Florence resolved to prosecute the\r\nwar, and engaged Count Guido Antonio di Montefeltro, Lord of Urbino,\r\nas their general. Thereupon the Lucchesi again appealed to the Duke\r\nof Milan, who permitted Niccolò Piccinino and his troops to take\r\nservice under Lucca. The continual interference of the “Ten” with their\r\ngenerals in the field resulted in one defeat after another. In these\r\ncircumstances Cosimo wrote his October letter. He recognises that the\r\nconduct of the war by Florence had been disastrous; sees, when too late\r\n(for the Milanese troops prevented it), that Lucca ought to have been\r\nstarved into surrender; and declares that the only way out of their\r\ndifficulties is for Florence to induce Venice to attack Milan from\r\nthe north. As the “Ten” from their gross mismanagement of the war had\r\noccurred great opprobrium in the city, and as there was little prospect\r\nof matters improving without aid from Venice, the astute Cosimo advises\r\nthat none of his prominent friends shall stand as candidate for\r\nelection to the Balìa. The letter of December relates to a proposed\r\nembassy to Venice to urge the great Republic to attack Milan.\r\n\r\nThe war went on for three years longer, and though we have no more\r\ncomments of Cosimo on the matter its course may be indicated. Venice\r\ndid at length yield to the prayers of the Tuscan Republic, and this\r\nbrought her rival Genoa into the fray. At last all parties were weary\r\nof the strife and desired peace. The Marquesses Ettore of Este and\r\nLodovico of Saluzzo were named arbiters. The Cardinal di Santa Croce\r\nagain worked for harmony. A general peace was concluded on April 26,\r\n1433, and its publication in Florence on May 10th was celebrated with\r\nall manner of popular rejoicings.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these wars and intrigues it is pleasant to see the good\r\nContessina careful only that her boys should be brought up in the old\r\nFlorentine fashion and that her husband should be properly clad.\r\n\r\nCosimo evidently continued to “be chary with ink and paper,” at all\r\nevents to his wife; as when he was again absent at Ferrara with their\r\ntwo sons, Contessina corresponded with Giovanni, the youngest, who was\r\nbarely fourteen.\r\n\r\n\r\nContessina de’ Medici _to her son_ Giovanni _at Ferrara_\r\n\r\n I wrote to thee a few days ago, so have but little to say. By a letter\r\n from Ser Alexo I gather you are all well, God be thanked. We are the\r\n same, thanks be to God. I hear that thou desirest to come home and\r\n dost not like the place. Thou shouldest be glad to be there, if only\r\n to be in the bank and to learn something. Besides it is not healthy\r\n here. Therefore, my son, I beg thee not to think of returning until\r\n the plague has ceased, and say the same to Piero. Let me know what\r\n clothes he has had made as I do not know what he wore when he left,\r\n and he has not asked me to send his coat lined with cloth. It has\r\n been very hot here for several days, and I suppose will have been the\r\n same there; so be careful and keep cool. I do not know why Cosimo\r\n has not told me to send his summer clothes, but I think he intends\r\n to return any day. Do thy best to please him in all things, and see\r\n that he wants for nothing; though they tell me he is quite fat, which\r\n is all that is needful. Commend me to madonna Dina and salute monna\r\n Ginevra and thank them from me; Ser Alano tells me they treat you\r\n both as though you were their brothers. I should also like much to\r\n know whether thou art working in the bank, thou or Piero, and whether\r\n Cosimo makes use of Piero. Mind and write this to me. I add no more.\r\n Christ guard thee.--At Castelluccio, 6th June 1430.\r\n\r\n                                                     Thy Contessina.[14]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the same year Cosimo again left Florence, partly on\r\naccount of the plague, but probably also on account of the bitter\r\nparty strife in the city. He writes to his cousin from Verona and then\r\nfrom Ostiglia, where he heard the news of the defeat of the Florentine\r\ntroops near Lucca.\r\n\r\n\r\nCosimo de’ Medici _to_ Averardo de’ Medici _at Pisa_\r\n\r\n During the last few days I have written thee several letters; this\r\n morning I received thine of the 18th and with it some letters received\r\n by thee from Florence; I have understood, &c. &c., and reply herewith.\r\n\r\n I see thou hast been at Florence and understand thou hast to go there\r\n again; the death of Francesco di Tomaso is a great loss, but if the\r\n plague increases I advise thee not to think of business but of saving\r\n thy life.\r\n\r\n The affairs of Lucca do not appear to turn out as we expected, which\r\n displeases me; and the money spent on Count Francesco [Sforza] was\r\n thrown away. Every one laughs at us because he could not remain on\r\n account of the plague, and only consumed the provisions of the people.\r\n It is clear that all that happened and is happening at Lucca has been\r\n done with the knowledge and by the orders of the Duke [of Milan],\r\n particularly as the principal fortresses are in his hands; it appears\r\n to me therefore that there is no hope of getting them by treaty or by\r\n any way save famine, and I suspect the Duke has known how to grasp\r\n fortune, and his troops being near, has provisioned Pietrasanta. The\r\n war will thus last longer than we wished, and all because we would\r\n not when we could. May God forgive those who are the cause. If some\r\n of the present Signori had not enough sense to be of the Ten of the\r\n Balia, instead of ten they should be made nine ... as I already told\r\n thee. It does not seem to me advisable to be one of the Ten of the\r\n Balia this time, partly to let others have their turn, partly because,\r\n on account of party divisions, I do not think the affairs of our\r\n city can prosper; things will go as they did before or even worse on\r\n account of events in Lombardy, for if the enemy is not attacked from\r\n there, it is useless to expect help from here. I am therefore writing\r\n to the Gonfalonier and to Antonio di Ser Tomaso to beg that neither\r\n Lorenzo[15] nor I should be nominated, and I advise thee to do the\r\n same. There are Messer Niccolò Valori and Luca di Messer Maso who\r\n would do well and be pleased.\r\n\r\n In my last I told thee that Lorenzo and the children were going to\r\n Venice, as there are some cases of plague here; now they are gone.\r\n If it continues I suppose we must also leave.... No more at present.\r\n Christ guard thee.--Verona, 21st October 1430.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\nCosimo de’ Medici _to_ Averardo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n I arrived here late this evening and found thy letter of the 4th\r\n telling me about the affairs of Lucca; right glad was I to get it,\r\n as yesterday on the road to Venice I heard far worse news. God be\r\n thanked. We certainly seem to have shown but little prudence; we will\r\n talk of this when we meet. Our people ought to hear what is said of us\r\n and how little we are esteemed; if we go on thus we shall be treated\r\n like Jews. I just hear that I have been elected ambassador together\r\n with Francesco Tornabuoni, and have understood about future movements.\r\n I was on the point of coming back on account of our own affairs and\r\n also about this nomination, of which I have only now been told, for it\r\n will be most inconvenient if I have to go, on account of our private\r\n affairs and also because I am not properly prepared, being away from\r\n home. I have therefore determined to come back at once and try to be\r\n exonerated. I think our friends will be willing to serve us if thou\r\n bestirrest thyself. Thou writest as though my going was certain, so\r\n perhaps I shall receive orders and have to start without returning\r\n home, which would be most awkward. If it be so tell Bernardo de’\r\n Medici to send me those suits which are at home, for as thou knowest\r\n we are in mourning and I have no clothes with me; also I shall have to\r\n provide myself with attendants and horses, I have but seven, and must\r\n have twelve at least. I write this, not because I have made up my mind\r\n to go, for this journey would be most irksome, but because if it is\r\n absolutely necessary I must go in a manner befitting the honour of the\r\n Commune.... No more. Christ guard thee.--In Ostilia [near Rimini] on\r\n the 10th day of December 1430.\r\n\r\n _P.S._--I intend taking the road by Ravenna and Faenza.[17]\r\n\r\nCosimo did not go, and Francesco Tornabuoni was sent alone to Venice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCosimo de’ Medici _at Florence to_ Averardo de’ Medici _at Pisa_\r\n\r\n I wrote to thee the other day by Pietro Chaetano, and have had no\r\n letter from thee since. This will be given to thee by Battista of\r\n Verrazano, who was it seems once employed in thy office, and is, I am\r\n told, a worthy man: he asks me to recommend him to thee, and I do so.\r\n\r\n About the affairs of Lucca I say nothing, because where thou art thou\r\n wilt hear them sooner than I. There are those who, hoping to see\r\n injury and infamy inflicted on others, would inflict injury and infamy\r\n on the Commune, and try with all their might to bring this about;\r\n which shows an evil nature. Nevertheless I think this enterprise is\r\n generally popular, and seeing things have gone so far as to implicate\r\n the honour of the Commune, every one ought to favour it as much as\r\n possible; and this I am doing here, and advise thee, although I know\r\n there is no need, to act likewise.\r\n\r\n Letters have come from the Duke displaying great affection for this\r\n Commune and promising every help in this affair. There are also\r\n letters from our ambassador at Rome, saying that the Pope and all the\r\n Cardinals are of the same mind, so it appears to me that they are\r\n abandoned by all, and if they are wise will submit.\r\n\r\n From Lorenzo[18] I have a letter of the 80th, and by what he says\r\n he must now have left Venice for Milan together with Messer Andrea\r\n Contarini. They have hopes of doing good business during this year,\r\n particularly as I understand the Duke is in need. Thou shalt hear as\r\n soon as I know anything.\r\n\r\n I hear thou hast had a few cases of plague, which grieves me: here\r\n also in the last two or three days there have been some cases, which\r\n makes one fear it may increase. The loss and damage to the city will\r\n be great. I have been thinking where to go, and as far as I can learn\r\n there are three places, either Arezzo in thy house near Anghiari,\r\n Bologna or Modena, or some distance into the Venetian territory, where\r\n it appears to be perfectly healthy. It does not seem to me wise to\r\n come there [Pisa] or to go near Siena or Perugia, for they are all\r\n suspect, as is the Romagna and the Malatesta district, where also\r\n they are preparing for war. As I said it is a serious matter, and\r\n I should like to have thy advice. No more at present. Christ guard\r\n thee.--February 1430 (1431).[19]\r\n\r\nIn April 1433 the war with Lucca came to an end, leaving things\r\nvery much as they were before, and the bitter hatred between Cosimo\r\nde’ Medici and Rinaldo degl’ Albizzi grew in intensity. The nobles\r\naccused Cosimo of using his riches to buy popularity, and he withdrew\r\nalmost entirely from public life and retired to Cafaggiuolo, his\r\nfortress-villa in the Mugello. What followed is best told in his own\r\nwords, translated from his diary.\r\n\r\n On the election of the new Signory (September 1433) it was rumoured\r\n that during their rule great changes were to be made. News was sent\r\n to me in the Mugello, where I had been for some months in order\r\n to escape from the contests and divisions in the city, that my\r\n presence was necessary. So on the 4th of September I returned, and\r\n on the same day visited the Gonfalonier and the others, as well as\r\n Giovanni dello Scelto who I thought was my friend, and who was under\r\n obligations to me, as were also the others. When I told them what\r\n I had heard, they denied it, and told me to be of good cheer, as\r\n they hoped to leave the city in the same condition as they found it\r\n when their time was up. On the 5th they called a council of eight\r\n citizens, saying they desired their advice on certain matters. They\r\n were Messer Giovanni Guicciardini, Bartolommeo Ridolfi, Ridolfo\r\n Peruzzi, Tommaso di Lapo Corsi, Messer Agnolo Acciaiuoli, Giovanni\r\n di Messer Rinaldo Gianfigliazzi, Messer Rinaldo degl’ Albizzi, and\r\n myself, Cosimo. So although, as has been said, it was reported that a\r\n revolution was imminent, yet, having their assurances and believing\r\n them to be my friends, I did not credit it. On the morning of the\r\n 7th, under colour of the said council, they sent for me; and when I\r\n arrived at the Palace I found most of my companions and we talked\r\n together. After some time I was told by order of the Signory to go\r\n upstairs, and by the captain of the infantry I was put into a room\r\n called the Barbaria,[20] and locked in. On hearing this the whole\r\n city rose. During the day a council was held by the citizens who had\r\n been summoned, and the Gonfalonier told them I had been detained for\r\n a good reason, which would be explained another time, and that the\r\n Signory desired no advice on this point, and so dismissed them. And\r\n the Signori banished me to Padua for a year. This decision was at\r\n once made known to my brother Lorenzo, who was in the Mugello, and\r\n to Averardo, my cousin, who was at Pisa. The news was also sent to\r\n Niccolò da Tolentino, captain of the Commune, who was my good friend.\r\n Lorenzo came to Florence that same day, and the Signori sent for him,\r\n but he being warned why they wanted him, left at once, and returned\r\n to Trebbio.[21] Averardo also left Pisa in haste, as they had given\r\n orders to seize him. Had they taken us all three, we should have been\r\n in evil plight. Niccolò da Tolentino, on hearing the news, came to\r\n Lastra with his company, intending to raise the city, so that I might\r\n be released. At the same time, when it was known in the mountains of\r\n the Romagna and in other places, great numbers of foot-soldiers went\r\n to Lorenzo. But the captain and Lorenzo were advised not to make a\r\n disturbance, or evil might befall me, so they desisted. Although this\r\n advice was given by relations and friends, and in all sincerity, yet\r\n it was not good, for had they advanced at once I should have been\r\n free, and he who was the cause of all would have been undone. We\r\n may, however, say that all was for the best, as in the end good came\r\n of it, and more honour to me, as I shall relate hereafter. My friends\r\n being averse, as I have said, to create any disturbance, the captain\r\n returned to his quarters, pretending that he had come for another\r\n reason, and Lorenzo went to Venice with my sons, taking with him\r\n all he could of money and small valuables. And the Signori banished\r\n Lorenzo to Venice for a year, myself to Padua for five years, and\r\n Averardo to Naples for five years. Then on the 9th the bell was rung\r\n for a parliament, and those who had been the cause of all assembled\r\n on the Piazza with much infantry. Twenty-three citizens were also\r\n summoned, verily a small number, and but few of the people were\r\n present, because in truth the mass of the citizens were ill-pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oration of Cosimo de’ Medici to the Signory _when sentence of exile\r\nwas pronounced against him_.[22]\r\n\r\n If I thought that this my misfortune and terrible ruin might serve\r\n to bring peace to this blessed people, not only would exile be\r\n acceptable, but I should even welcome death, if I were sure that my\r\n descendants, O Signori, might pride themselves on my having been the\r\n cause of the wished-for union of your Republic. As you have decided\r\n that I am to go to Padua, I declare that I am content to go, and to\r\n stay wherever you command, not only in the Trevisian State, but should\r\n you send me to live amongst the Arabs, or any other people alien to\r\n our customs, I would go most willingly; and if your Lordships command\r\n me to discover the origin of the ill, as a beloved son is bound to\r\n obey his father’s wishes and a good servant the orders of his master,\r\n so would I obey you for the peace of your people. One thing I beg\r\n of you, O Signori, that seeing you intend to preserve my life, you\r\n take care that it should not be taken by wicked citizens, and thus\r\n you be put to shame. I do not so much fear the pain of death as the\r\n abominable infamy of undeserved assassination, for a violent death\r\n is the manifest sign and outcome of a bad life, and I have not led\r\n the life of a villain, but of an honest and good merchant. Even if\r\n I have not been faultless, I have always tried to merit the love of\r\n good men, because my actions were good. As, however, disaster comes to\r\n me by your orders, I accept it as a boon, and as a benefit to me and\r\n to my belongings. Have a care, O Signori, that those should not have\r\n their way who are in the Piazza with arms in their hands and anxiously\r\n desire my blood, without regard for my innocence. My pain would be\r\n small, because such a death being over in a short time cannot be very\r\n painful or hard to bear; nothing is so brief as death. But you would\r\n earn perpetual infamy by having made me a promise which was broken\r\n by villainous citizens: infamy is worse than an innocent death. If\r\n I go to the Trevisian State, I leave my heart and my soul with you,\r\n and shall only be happy when I can do something for the good of your\r\n people, as I pray you and every good citizen to do. Every trouble will\r\n be easy to bear as long as I know that my adversity will bring peace\r\n and happiness to the city. I know, and this is no small comfort to me,\r\n that I never permitted wrong to be done to any one. I never frequented\r\n the Palace[23] save when I was summoned; I never roused hatred of\r\n the Republic amongst your subalterns, because I never ill-treated\r\n them; I always declined to be nominated an official, which is often\r\n prejudicial to the body and hurtful to the soul; with no small pride\r\n I affirm that none can say my ill-behaviour ever caused a city to\r\n rebel or to be taken from you; on the contrary, our money bought\r\n several: ask your soldiers how many times they were paid by me for the\r\n Commune with my own money, to be returned to me when convenient to\r\n the Commune. Never have I been found wanting when the Commune could be\r\n enlarged, and although I am exiled, I shall ever be ready at the call\r\n of this people. In conclusion, O Signori, I pray God to keep you in\r\n his grace and in happiness in this fortunate Republic, and to give me\r\n patience to bear my unhappy life.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n Balìa was given by the parliament to certain citizens and I was\r\n banished to Padua for ten years, Lorenzo to Venice for five, Averardo\r\n to Naples for ten, Orlando de’ Medici to Ancona for ten years, and\r\n Giovanni di Andrea di Messer Alamanno and Bernardo d’Alamanno de’\r\n Medici to Rimini. My branch of the family were created Grandi (_i.e._\r\n incapable of holding any magisterial office), with the exception of\r\n the sons of Messer Vieri, and the sons of Antonio di Giovenco de’\r\n Medici, because Bernardetto was much beloved by the Captain of War,\r\n and in deference to the Captain, Averardo and his brothers were passed\r\n over. We were more rigorously dealt with, particularly in that I was\r\n forbidden to sell any possessions or to touch my money in the Monte,\r\n and I was kept in the Palace until the 3rd day of October.\r\n\r\n When this was known in Venice three ambassadors were sent here, who\r\n left no means untried to procure my liberation, offering to keep me\r\n in Venice, and promising that I would do nothing against the Signory,\r\n and would obey all orders. Though they could not obtain my freedom\r\n yet their advent was most useful, for there were those who desired\r\n my death, and they secured a promise that no harm should be done to\r\n my person. In like manner the Marquess of Ferrara sent orders to the\r\n Captain of the Balìa, who was Messer Lodovico del Ronco of Modena, a\r\n subject of his, that if I were put in his hands he was to treat me as\r\n though I were Messer Lionardo his son, and that if he fled with me he\r\n was to fear nothing.\r\n\r\n They kept me, as has been said, until the 3rd of October for two\r\n reasons; first, to obtain permission from the Balìa to rule the city\r\n according to their pleasure, threatening to kill me if it was not\r\n given; thus those of my friends and relations who were in the Balìa\r\n were fain to agree to all they wished. Secondly, they thought to\r\n ruin us by preventing me from making use of what was mine. But in\r\n this they failed, for we lost no credit, and many foreign merchants\r\n and gentlemen offered to us, and even sent to Venice, large sums of\r\n money. Finding at length that their plan of making us bankrupt did\r\n not succeed, Bernardo Guadagni (the Gonfalonier), being offered money\r\n by two persons, 500 florins by the Captain of War, and 500 by the\r\n treasurer of S. Maria Nuova, which were paid him in cash, and Mariotto\r\n Balduinetto being offered 800 florins by Baccio d’Antonio di Baccio,\r\n they took me out of the Palace and accompanied me beyond the Porta\r\n S. Gallo. They had small intelligence, for they might have had ten\r\n thousand or more for allowing me to escape from peril.\r\n\r\n On the 4th October I arrived at Cutigliano in the mountains of\r\n Pistoja, being accompanied by two of the Eight of the guard. The\r\n mountaineers presented to me wax and grain as though I had been an\r\n ambassador. On the 5th I left and arrived at Fassano in the territory\r\n of the Marquess of Ferrara, accompanied by more than twenty of the\r\n mountaineers. On the 6th I reached Modena, and the governor met me on\r\n behalf of his lord, presented gifts, and next morning went with me as\r\n companion and guide. On the 7th I was at Bondeno and next day went by\r\n water to Francolino, where I waited two days for Antonio Uguccione de’\r\n Contrari, who made me many offers of service from the Marquess. On the\r\n 11th I arrived at Venice, being met by many gentlemen, our friends,\r\n together with Lorenzo. I was received like an ambassador, not like an\r\n exile. Next morning I visited the Signori to thank them for all they\r\n had done for my welfare, saying that I owed my life to them. I was\r\n received with more honour and affection than I can describe; they\r\n pitied my sufferings and offered the Signoria, the city, and their\r\n treasure for my needs, and a house. Many gentlemen visited me and\r\n brought me gifts. On the 13th I left for Padua according to command,\r\n and Messer Jacopo Donato went with me and lodged me in his fine\r\n house, furnished with linen, beds, and eatables fit for the greatest\r\n personage, and he remained with me until I returned to Venice about\r\n the 20th. At Padua, by order of the Signoria of Venice, they offered\r\n to place at my disposal anything I wanted. I have recorded these\r\n honours that were paid to me in order not to seem ungrateful by not\r\n mentioning them, and also because it is incredible that, banished from\r\n home, I should yet be treated with so much honour; for generally one\r\n loses one’s friends with one’s fortune. Lorenzo was informed with what\r\n honour I had been treated by some merchants, and also by a servant of\r\n the Signoria who came to Padua with me, and who had been ordered not\r\n to speak about it.\r\n\r\n Bartolommeo de’ Ridolfi being Gonfalonier of Justice, I asked leave of\r\n the Signori to be allowed to live at Padua, Venice, or elsewhere, in\r\n the Venetian territory, and the permission was given, but with orders\r\n not to approach within 140 miles of Florence. This was done to please\r\n the Signoria of Venice who, through their ambassador, Messer Andrea\r\n Donato, asked it. It is true that severe penalties were attached to\r\n the grace, as can be seen in the document.\r\n\r\nAfter giving the names of the new Gonfalonier and Priors (who were\r\nelected every two months), Cosimo continues:\r\n\r\n The people and all good citizens being discontented, Antonio di Ser\r\n Tommaso Nasi came to me at Venice and begged me to draw nigh to\r\n Florence, offering to escort us home in case we were attacked. Also\r\n many of our relations and friends wrote to us. We thought it better to\r\n first ascertain the intentions of the Signori, and replied we would\r\n do nothing against their wishes. For this we sent Antonio Martelli\r\n from Venice to learn what they wished. From him we got the good news\r\n that we were to come. On receiving the letter Lorenzo and I, Cosimo,\r\n left on the 29th of September; Averardo, being ill of fever, remained\r\n in Venice. On the 30th we reached Ponte a Lago and lodged in the\r\n house of the Magnificent Uguccione who, together with the Marquess,\r\n had collected at our request a large body of foot-soldiers in the\r\n mountains of Modena and Frigano, together with 200 horsemen he had\r\n in his pay, to accompany us as had been previously arranged. On the\r\n 1st October, while we were at mass, a courier arrived from Antonio\r\n Salutati with letters stating that the intentions of the Signori\r\n having become known in the city, and our arrival being expected, our\r\n enemies, that is to say Messer Rinaldo degl’ Albizzi, Ridolfo Peruzzi,\r\n and others had taken up arms on the 26th to the number of 600. But\r\n their heart failed them towards evening, and being persuaded by\r\n Messer Giovanni Vitelleschi, then Bishop of Recanati, and afterwards\r\n Archbishop of Florence and a Cardinal, who was my good friend, they\r\n went to S. Maria Novella, where dwelt the Pope.[24] Hearing that our\r\n friends were well provided with arms and with men, and being in fear\r\n for their lives, Messer Rinaldo, Ormanno his son, and Ridolfo Peruzzi\r\n remained there that night, and their companions dispersed and put away\r\n their arms. The Signori summoned a large force of infantry to come\r\n into the city, while from the Mugello, the Alps, and Romagna more\r\n than 3000 men came to our house. Niccolò da Tolentino was called with\r\n his company, and on the 29th, the day of S. Michael, a parliament was\r\n held on the Piazza, at which the people assisted fully armed. Their\r\n number was great, and good order was kept. Balìa was given to ...\r\n citizens and they annulled all that had been ordained the year before.\r\n First they decided that Cosimo and Lorenzo should be reinstated in\r\n their former positions--there were not four contrary votes--so we\r\n were pressed to come home with all speed. Having read the letter, we\r\n at once sent it to Venice, where it caused much rejoicing, and we\r\n then went to visit the Marquess, who showed even more pleasure than\r\n ourselves. After thanking him for all the favours he had shown us\r\n we left Ferrara on the 2nd and got to Modena next day. The Governor\r\n and the Podestà came out to meet us with many citizens, and we were\r\n received most honourably in the Marquess’s house. All our journey\r\n was at his expense, and everywhere we found men-at-arms who had been\r\n ordered to accompany us; but there being no need for them we dismissed\r\n them. On the 5th we reached Cutigliano and then Pistoja; and exactly\r\n at the expiration of a year, on the very same day, _i.e._ the 5th\r\n October, we again set foot in the Commune at exactly the same place.\r\n I record this because when we were banished some well-affected and\r\n kindly persons told us that before the year was out we should be\r\n recalled, and once more find ourselves in Florence. Many citizens came\r\n out to meet us on the road, and at Pistoja the whole population was at\r\n the gate to see us pass fully armed, for we would not enter the town.\r\n On the 6th we arrived at our own house, Careggi, to dinner, and found\r\n much people. The Signori sent to tell us not to enter the city until\r\n they told us, and this we did. At sunset they sent to bid us come and\r\n we set forth with a great following. But as the road we were expected\r\n to take was crowded with men and women, Lorenzo and I with one servant\r\n and a mace-bearer of the Commune rode round the walls. Going behind\r\n the Servi, and then behind S. Reparata and the Palazzo del Podestà,\r\n we entered the Palazzo de’ Signori without being seen, as every one\r\n was in Via Larga, waiting for us near our house. The reason why the\r\n Signori did not wish us to enter by daylight was lest we should be the\r\n cause of an uproar in the city. By the Signori we were received most\r\n graciously. We thanked them with fitting words, and they insisted on\r\n our remaining in the Palace with them and some other citizens. We did\r\n so. We found that before we arrived Messer Rinaldo and Ormanno his\r\n son, Ridolfo Peruzzi, and many other citizens had been banished. The\r\n city was quiet, though the people were always in the Piazza, and in\r\n the Palace were many armed men for security.\r\n\r\nCosimo gives the names of the Signory for November and December and\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n They banished many citizens and set down (_i.e._ made _Grandi_ or\r\n nobles) many disloyal families and did many things favourable to the\r\n city. During their rule the Balìa given to various citizens expired,\r\n the Squittini, or Scrutinies, came to an end, and the borse, or\r\n ballot-bags, remained for five years in the hands of the Accopiatori,\r\n that is to say, the borse of the Priors, so that they could make\r\n whomsoever they would Priors and Gonfaloniers of Justice. In January\r\n my name was the first to be drawn from the borse as Gonfalonier, and\r\n in my time no one was banished nor was ill done to any one. I caused\r\n the sentence of death passed upon Francesco Guadagni, and upon some\r\n others whom I found in the hands of the Captain of the Balìa, to be\r\n commuted to perpetual imprisonment. Also I ordered the armed men who\r\n stood at the door of the Palace to be removed and the Palace and the\r\n Piazza to be kept as they were before the revolution, and I prolonged\r\n the league with the Signory of Venice for ten years.\r\n\r\n“Seldom has a citizen returning triumphant from a victory,” writes\r\nMachiavelli, “been received by such a concourse of people and with such\r\ndemonstrations of affection as was Cosimo on his return from exile,\r\nsaluted by all as the benefactor of the people and the father of his\r\ncountry.”[25]\r\n\r\nIt was probably while at Venice that Cosimo bought the slave girl\r\nby whom he had a son, Carlo, who was brought up for the Church and\r\nrecognised as belonging to the family. He inherited his father’s\r\ntastes, and was employed by him and by Piero to buy books,\r\nmanuscripts, statues, &c., in Rome. He became a Canon of the cathedral\r\nin Florence and Arciprete at Prato, where he died. The number of female\r\nslaves imported into Florence in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries\r\nwas a most disturbing element in family life and the cause of much\r\njealousy, as can be gathered from the novelists of the time. Nearly\r\nall came from Caffa (Theodosia in the Crimea) and from the mouth of\r\nthe Tana. Caffa must have been practically a Genoese settlement, as\r\nthe Genoese consul levied a tax on every slave that passed through the\r\ntown, and they were many. Hundreds of Circassian, Tartar, Armenian,\r\nGeorgian, Arab, Turkish, Russian, and Greek girls were shipped, chiefly\r\nto Genoa and to Venice, where the trade had existed since the eighth\r\ncentury. In Florence the duty paid on every slave that entered the city\r\nmust have brought in a considerable sum to the Commune, as owners were\r\nobliged to register every newly-acquired slave within two months and to\r\nhave him or her baptized, if the rite had not been already performed.\r\nOne would have thought that good Catholics might have had some qualms\r\nof conscience about keeping a Christian as a slave, but Sacchetti\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n“May a slave being born a pagan who becomes a Christian be sold? I say\r\nyes. None may be free who do not believe that Christ will come again.\r\nEven though I buy a slave who is then baptized, he or she is baptized\r\nas a servant and a subject and is like unto one in prison, who cannot\r\ngive a bond or go bail, and most of them go to baptism like oxen.\r\nBaptism does not make them Christians, and no one is obliged to set\r\nthem free even if they be Christians unless they wish. I do not say\r\nthat if you perceive them to be good, and that they desire to be good\r\nChristians, you should not set them free, but you would commit a sin if\r\nyour slave is like most, even if he or she be a Christian, to set them\r\nfree, for you take the stick from off their backs and give them full\r\nscope to do every sort of evil.”[26]\r\n\r\nThe saintly Archbishop Antonino is of the same opinion as the novelist.\r\nHe declares that baptism does not free a person from slavery, _quia\r\nservitus introducta est etiam de jure divino et per jus gentium et jus\r\ncanonicum approbata_.\r\n\r\nBy a law of 1366 the flight of a slave was declared a serious offence;\r\nany one aiding or inciting a slave to run away was fined 200 florins\r\n(piccoli), half to go to the Commune, half to the owner. The seduction\r\nof a slave was still more severely punished, and the seducer was held\r\nresponsible for her price if she died in childbirth. If the father was\r\na free man the child was also free, and the father was bound to provide\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nFrom 1366 to 1397, 259 Tartars, 27 Greeks (from Constantinople or from\r\nRhodes), 7 Turks, 3 Slavonians, 3 Circassians, 2 Bosnians, 1 Arab, 1\r\nSaracen, and 1 Candiote, nearly all girls from nine to twenty-four\r\nyears of age, and 26 little boys or lads, are carefully described in\r\nthe register. They cannot have been handsome, as many were marked with\r\nsmall-pox, others had scars (_margines_) which were probably tribal\r\nmarks.[27]\r\n\r\nThey were sold either _sub jugo perpetue servitutis_, or for a certain\r\nnumber of years. Thus Rucellai bought a slave for eight years, but\r\nfinding that she was with child he sent her back to her former\r\nowner; many were bought, or rather hired, for two or three years as\r\nwet-nurses. Baldovinetti in his _Ricordi_ or Memoirs notes: “On May\r\n7, 1376, I bought a slave for thirty-five florins from Bartolommeo\r\nof Venice, named Tiratea, or Dorothea, a Tartar from Russia. She was\r\nabout eighteen years of age, and Cieci the broker only put twenty-five\r\nflorins into the bill of sale on account of the duty. With brokerage\r\nand duty she cost me one florin, and four florins for clothes, as she\r\nwas almost naked when I bought her. I sold her in September 1379 for\r\nthirty-six florins.\r\n\r\n“In 1380 I bought on November 28th a slave for forty-five florins, her\r\nname is Domenica, she is fair-skinned and comes from near Tartary. I\r\nbought her of Bartolommeo of Venice, who in writing declares her to be\r\nsound in all ways. With brokerage and other expenses she cost me before\r\nI got her home eleven golden florins, and as she was almost naked,\r\naltogether forty-seven florins.”[28]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                                               _Alinari_\r\n\r\nCOSIMO DI GIOVANNI DE’ MEDICI.\r\n\r\n_By Jacopo da Pontormo. In the Convent of S. Marco, Florence._]\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century prices rose, as the Florentines insisted on\r\nhaving Russian or Circassian girls as being better-looking. Their\r\nreputation for honesty and morality did not stand high, and they were\r\noften brutally ill-treated and imprisoned in the dreaded prison of\r\nthe Stinche for stealing, &c. Alessandra Strozzi, writing to her son\r\nFilippo at Naples in 1465, warns him about two he thought of buying.\r\n\r\n“Thou tellest me in thy letter of the 28th that a slave is offered\r\nthee who was here with Lionardo Vernacci and that thou wouldest have\r\ntaken her but for the old one thou hast in the house. I must tell\r\nthee that she is not fit for thee according to my ideas. Lionardo’s\r\nwife had her four or five years, and as she did not learn and was of\r\na bad disposition they feared she might do some ill to herself or to\r\nothers, so they got rid of her; she was also dishonest. They sold her\r\nto Antonio della Luna, with whom she remained but a short time, as\r\nhe would not have her and sent her back; so she was sent down there\r\n[Naples]. Lionardo’s wife had her for sewing, but she had no aptitude\r\nfor it. Had she been a good servant they would have kept her for\r\nthemselves. Thou sayest thou hast one now who belonged to Filippo degl’\r\nAlbizzi; she was highly thought of and well treated, but was sold\r\nbecause wine began to affect her and made her extremely lively, and\r\nalso she was immoral. Having a wife and children in the house he would\r\nnot keep her. She is praised for loyalty and intelligence. Now do as\r\nthou wilt.... I have told thee what I know.”[29]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the fifteenth century the manumission of slaves\r\nbegins to be mentioned in wills together with bequests to hospitals\r\nand convents. By the word _este civis romana_ the slave became a free\r\nman or woman, could own property, buy and sell, and act in all other\r\nrespects as if free-born.[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nCosimo de’ Medici _to his son_ Piero de’ Medici _at Venice_\r\n\r\n Send by the women who are returning the things mentioned in the list\r\n given to Ser G., and look closely yourself, as is but right, after\r\n what is sent here and what remains there.\r\n\r\n Put the books that are in my desk into a small strong-box so that\r\n they should not be opened, and see that the others which we lent\r\n should be sent back in such a manner as not to spoiled.\r\n\r\n It seems to me that thou shouldest remain at Venice this winter, for\r\n there is nothing doing here, and thus thou canst devote thyself to\r\n learning something of the affairs of the bank and of book-keeping. I\r\n have ordered a book which thou art to keep according to instructions\r\n which Antonio Martelli will send thee. In this way thou wilt learn\r\n book-keeping properly, and canst return here at Lent.\r\n\r\n Be careful to conduct thyself well at home and abroad, so as not to\r\n put either me or thyself to shame. Consort with our friends according\r\n to usage; make thyself acquainted with what is doing in the company,\r\n and learn what is going on.\r\n\r\n Try to get back that book on ethics from the son of Messer P.\r\n Corro,[31] and the Sallust and Suetonius I lent to G. Lignacci, in\r\n one volume. If they have done with them get them back before S. Lucia\r\n (13th December). Also get back a small volume of Chrysostom which\r\n they say they want to translate. Keep the books from Nicola de Servi,\r\n as is said in the minute given to Ser G., and send back twenty or\r\n twenty-five volumes of our books of each subject. Thou canst put\r\n them with the quilts, or in other bales, so that they should not be\r\n spoiled, and take care that those which remain are not gnawed or\r\n spoiled.\r\n\r\n As I said before, for many reasons I think it would be better for thee\r\n to remain at Venice, for nothing of any good is doing here. But if\r\n thou wishest to return here, do as thou wilt. Nought else to say.--[No\r\n date.]\r\n\r\n                                                             Cosimo.[32]\r\n\r\nThe letter of Lorenzo de’ Medici and those of Francesco Sforza to\r\nCosimo relate to a second war with Lucca, and need some explanation.\r\nThe recall of Cosimo from exile, as told in his diary, was followed\r\nby a wholesale banishment of his enemies from Florence, and left him\r\npractically master of the Republic. The exiled Florentines naturally\r\ndesired to return, and according to the custom of the time were eager\r\nto invoke foreign aid. The times for long offered no opportunity. But\r\nin 1436 Genoa at last shook off the yoke of the Duke of Milan and\r\nbecame a republic. The sister republics of Florence and Venice at\r\nonce allied themselves with the new free State, and Filippo Visconti\r\nbelieved himself to be seriously threatened by the new league. He had\r\nat the same time lost the services of one of his two great generals.\r\nFrancesco Sforza, determined to acquire a principality for himself,\r\nhad seized part of the Marches which nominally belonged to the Popes.\r\nIn these circumstances the Duke of Milan resolved to attack Florence,\r\nthe one of the allies which lay nearest to him. While the Florentines\r\nengaged mercenary troops (Taliano, or Tagliano, mentioned in the\r\nletters, being one of the leaders of small bands) and named Sforza\r\nthe General of the Republic--a very untrustworthy general, as events\r\nproved. In the war which ensued Lucca was attacked by the Florentines\r\nand defended by the troops of Milan. In 1438 Florence was twice\r\nthreatened by Visconti’s army, then in the territory of Lucca. The\r\nsecond time they were led by the famous condottiere Niccolò Piccinino,\r\nand Francesco Sforza had orders to oppose him and if possible to seize\r\nLucca. The attempt failed, partly because Sforza, always hoping to\r\nobtain the hand of Madonna Bianca, Visconti’s illegitimate daughter,\r\ndid not wish to offend him by fighting against his troops, partly\r\nbecause Venice, jealous of the possible acquisition of Lucca by\r\nFlorence, laid claim to his services and refused to pay her share of\r\nhis stipend unless her commands were obeyed. Cosimo went to Venice\r\n“thinking,” writes Machiavelli, “to be able to persuade her. To the\r\nSenate he pointed out the condition of Italy, the power of the Duke of\r\nMilan, his reputation and the number of his troops, and concluded by\r\nsaying that if the Count (Sforza) went over to him they would together\r\ncommand the sea, and the liberty of Venice would be endangered. To this\r\nthe Venetians replied that they well knew their own power and the power\r\nof the Italians, and believed they could defend themselves. Adding that\r\nthey were not in the habit of recompensing soldiers for serving others,\r\nand that the Florentines, having made use of the Count, might pay him\r\nthemselves. They considered it more necessary for the safety of their\r\nState to lower his pride than to give him money; and the ambition of\r\nmen being unlimited, if he were paid now without serving them, he would\r\neventually advance far more dishonest and dangerous demands. Thus it\r\nseemed to them desirable to curb his insolence before it became too\r\ngreat. But if out of fear, or for any other reason, the Florentines\r\ndesired to retain his friendship, they were at liberty to pay him. Thus\r\nCosimo returned without concluding anything.”[33]\r\n\r\nCosimo never forgave the Venetians for traversing his plans, and the\r\nenmity between the two Republics began from that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nNiccolò Fortebraccio _to_ Cosimo de’ Medici _and_ Neri di Gino Capponi\r\n\r\n _Magnifico Domino et spectabili viro Fratibus carissimus Cosme de\r\n Medicis civitatis Flor.

For your information I send you the enclosed copy\r\n of a letter from the aforesaid Count found in the bosom of one of\r\n his people, by which you will understand, &c. You will no doubt take\r\n counsel about it with your friends, so that I shall not have to call\r\n you blind Florentines,[34] as others have called you before. By my\r\n faith you ought not to be, but rather you should have a hundred eyes\r\n like Argus.--Assisi, January 5, 1436 (1437).\r\n\r\n                                              Nicolaus Fortebraccis.[35]\r\n\r\n\r\n Lorenzo de’ Medici _to his brother_ Cosimo de’ Medici, _ambassador to\r\n Ferrara, in the name of the “Dieci di Balìa”_\r\n\r\n _Spectabilis collega noster carissime_,--Yesterday I wrote to thee\r\n by Messer Alexio. Since then we have nought from thee. Now we write\r\n because having turned over in our own minds this affair of Taliano and\r\n consulted with other citizens about it, it seems to us that it would\r\n be an excellent thing for the State of Count Francesco and for the\r\n League if some arrangement could be come to between His Holiness the\r\n Pope and the aforesaid Count as to the Marches, as thou art aware was\r\n once proposed. We therefore tell thee to employ every possible means\r\n to achieve this, which would be a most excellent thing, and as soon as\r\n thou canst learn aught about the intention of the Holy Father let us\r\n know, because until we hear from thee we shall not communicate with\r\n the Count.\r\n\r\n To-day we have received a letter from our ambassadors to the Count, of\r\n which we enclose a copy. It appears to us a new departure, of which\r\n we know nothing, which we do not understand, nor can we judge how the\r\n Signoria of Venice will take it when they hear. Think over it well,\r\n and if it seems good to thee to tell them or to take any other steps,\r\n do so, only make them understand perfectly that we have nothing to do\r\n with this affair, which is quite outside our intentions, and above\r\n all declare that it is our desire to live in perfect brotherhood and\r\n friendship with that Signoria, and thus to cause the Count to keep on\r\n good terms with them. If this letter finds thee at Ferrara, and thou\r\n thinkest well to send or to write to Venice about this business, or\r\n if thou thinkest better neither to send or to write, do as it seemeth\r\n best to thee, for we place complete trust in thy well-known prudence.\r\n To-day Messer Giuliano Davanzati has been named ambassador to Venice\r\n by the Signori and the Colleges, and they have sent for him to\r\n Pisa.--Florence, January 29, 1437 (1438).\r\n\r\n                                                        Decem Balie.[36]\r\n\r\n\r\nCount Francesco Sforza _to_ Cosimo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Spectabilis ac Magnifice vir tanquam pater carissime_,--I have\r\n read your letter and see you suspect that Niccolò Piccinino is not\r\n following the course traced by the Illustrious Duke of Milan, and you\r\n beg me to come to a good understanding with Niccolò, lest danger to\r\n the Magnificent Commune of Florence and to myself should ensue. As\r\n to the said Niccolò, I cannot believe he would act thus. First, on\r\n account of the great honours he has received and is receiving from the\r\n Illustrious Lord Duke, who only now has with great pomp declared him\r\n Marquess and Count of the house of Visconti with the right of bearing\r\n their arms. Secondly, because being of a certain age and with so great\r\n a reputation in the past, I do not believe that he would run the risk\r\n of being reviled in the present. Also he must know that he cannot\r\n swallow the world, and that it might happen to him as it does to oxen\r\n when they leave their stables in the morning, who think they are going\r\n to pasture, but are put to the plough; to him also the contrary might\r\n happen to what he expected. Thirdly, as you know, he has published\r\n everywhere a letter declaring his allegiance to the Duke of Milan.\r\n\r\n As to your advice about being good friends with him, I think you\r\n say well; and by the copies of my letters to Niccolò, which Lorenzo\r\n must have sent you, you will see whether it is my fault or his that\r\n this has not succeeded. It is true, and I declare to you, that I do\r\n not intend to lose my honour or my possessions for the sake of his\r\n friendship, and it would be a strange thing if in order to gain the\r\n friendship of the said Niccolò, I, who have always transacted and\r\n settled all disputes between the Duke and myself, and those arising\r\n from them, should be the first to lose what is mine, and what has\r\n been gained by my own exertions. I am certain that even should I wish\r\n to give away my possessions, or to make any sort of compromise which\r\n would indicate a doubt as to my ownership, you, whom I regard as a\r\n father, would not allow it, seeing how my reputation would suffer.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n To conclude, I have agreed with the Duke of Milan and have the\r\n agreement in my house, which I quite believe he will observe. In the\r\n document there is no mention, either for good or for evil, of Niccolò\r\n Piccinino, so I have nothing to do with him, and am much astonished\r\n at the things he demands of me. Now either he does this with the\r\n knowledge and consent of the Duke or not. If with the Duke’s consent\r\n it is done with the intent that this affair should go on and that\r\n your Signoria should break the promises and contracts with me, which\r\n I do not believe; if done without the Duke’s knowledge it is most\r\n probable he will take another course. In so doing he would give us\r\n every right to oppose him, and he might in many cases be a loser, in\r\n one among others which would bring infinite loss and ignominy upon\r\n him, that is his Company, for eight out of ten of the men have wives\r\n or children, so that what would happen I know not, and do not see that\r\n Niccolò would gain either profit or honour. My opinion, which I have\r\n not breathed to man alive, is that the Duke has consented to Niccolò\r\n putting forward these demands, not seeing how to refuse him permission\r\n to make them, but not with the intention that we should come to blows.\r\n And you will see that Niccolò will eventually follow the course traced\r\n out by the Duke, and that all these intrigues and demonstrations, and\r\n loud talk, wherein Niccolò shows such valour, are rather scarecrows\r\n to frighten people; but scarecrows are good for frightening kites and\r\n such-like birds of prey, I do not heed them, being the son of a Sforza\r\n and not of a kite. Let what will happen, as long as none can say that\r\n I have been the cause of any troubles. I am not; and I believe I shall\r\n be held guiltless by God and by the world. But whoso tries to take\r\n from me what is mine will find it far harder and more thorny than to\r\n demand it, as at present. I have replied to the Marquess, so there is\r\n no more to say.--Given in my Camp near Arezzo, 28th May 1438.[37]\r\n\r\n\r\nCount Francesco Sforza _to_ Cosimo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice tanquam Pater carissime_,--I have received your letter in\r\n cipher and have understood what you say about the affairs of Florence,\r\n Venice, and Macerata; I need say no more, because Messer Rinaldo will\r\n inform you of everything. I thank you for the news about Lombardy. I\r\n had heard something of the sort here, and that the Venetian troops\r\n were as though they did not exist, so little are they esteemed by\r\n those of the Duke of Milan. The arrival of the person sent by the\r\n magnificent Signoria of Florence will be most welcome to me, the\r\n sooner he comes the better I shall be pleased.\r\n\r\n Piero Gian Paolo [Orsini] passed through here and sent to tell me\r\n that if I wished he would join me, as he is disengaged, and says he\r\n has been badly treated with regard to money, and also that others no\r\n better than himself, such as Tagliano and Luigi del Verme, have been\r\n set above him and have received more honours, so nothing will induce\r\n him to remain there, which may be useful. It would be good in every\r\n respect to have him, but you know what are my expenses, so that I\r\n cannot alone undertake to engage him. Therefore I wish the Signoria\r\n of Florence would do so at the rate of 8 ducats a month and 1 for\r\n commission, whereas the Signoria pays 12 for each man. I pray you let\r\n me know quickly as to the intentions of the Signoria, so that I may\r\n know what to do. Until I have your reply I shall keep the affair in\r\n suspense, although I am not sure whether he really means what he says\r\n or not. If he does, the thing may be arranged; if he does not, it will\r\n fall of itself, and at any rate we may discover why he came here. For\r\n it is better to be forewarned and on one’s guard against the craft\r\n of others. I have no more to say save that I am advancing into the\r\n Marches and shall be near there.--_Paratus ad omnia_, 11th August 1438.\r\n\r\n                                           Francesco Sforza Vicecomes,\r\n                                           _Comes et Marchie_, _&c._[38]\r\n\r\n\r\nCount Francesco Sforza _to_ Cosimo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice tanquam Pater carissime_,--The honourable Alamano is going\r\n to inform the Signoria exactly how things are, and from him you will\r\n have ample information. And as I think you will discuss whether\r\n it will be better to side with the Signoria of Venice as has been\r\n suggested, or with Niccolò Piccinino, as you will see in the despatch\r\n brought by the said Alamano, I hereby give you my opinion. Seeing that\r\n the Signoria of Venice are up to their throats in water, and that\r\n their State is half ruined, and that now, when the need is great, they\r\n do nothing; and also considering that to remedy this state of things\r\n they will need much time, and will delay when quickness is necessary;\r\n and also considering that the Signoria of Florence, yourself,\r\n and others, were always advised to ally yourselves with the said\r\n Piccinino, I conceive that it is far more dangerous to steer a middle\r\n course than to side with one or the other. For these reasons it is far\r\n better to side with Niccolò Piccinino, particularly as the Duke of\r\n Milan has several times advised me to do so, and has just written me\r\n duplicate instructions, saying he will never give me Madonna Bianca,\r\n or anything else I desire from him, unless I am in perfect accord with\r\n and make an alliance with Niccolò Piccinino. This can be done to avoid\r\n all trouble. So I send Battista my secretary with my conclusions for\r\n you to see, and have taken time enough to answer for the reply to come\r\n from Florence; for whatever you decide is to be done, will be well\r\n done. In case you do not agree, take the course that seems best to\r\n that Magnificent Commune, only let me know; for what I once said I say\r\n again, that my wishes are those of that Magnificent Commune. Only I\r\n wanted to give my opinion. If the Magnificent Commune and you decide\r\n for Niccolò Piccinino, you can tell Battista to write at once without\r\n referring to me, and to follow his instructions, because the Commune\r\n is contented with what I have done. Despatch the courier to Mantua,\r\n for he knows that road, and in case he has not passed through let him\r\n wait. But if the alliance with Niccolò Piccinino does not please you\r\n do not write there, but to me here as quickly as possible. In any\r\n case negotiations with Venice must be kept open, and if you write to\r\n Battista be so good as to tell me at once, so that I may know how\r\n things go.--Given in our Camp, 22nd August 1438.\r\n\r\n                                       Francesco Sforza,\r\n                                       _Vicecomes et Marchio_, _&c._[39]\r\n\r\nThe careful, rather fussy nature of Contessina is shown in this letter\r\nto her son, who was evidently staying, together with his younger\r\nbrother Giovanni, with his uncle Lorenzo, perhaps at Trebbio, the old\r\ncastle on a hill above Cafaggiuolo in the Mugello.\r\n\r\n\r\nContessina de’ Medici _to her son_ Piero di Cosimo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Most dear Son,--Thou tellest me to send thee the grey cape lined with\r\n lynx, because thou hast suffered from the cold. But why? For hadst\r\n thou asked for it before I should have sent it as I did the other. It\r\n appears to me you have all decided not to return to Careggi on Monday\r\n where, thanks be to God, we are all well. It will be a happy hour, for\r\n it seems to me a thousand years till you come home again. I am sure\r\n you are all very busy there, particularly Ginevra,[40] so help her in\r\n every way that thou knowest and canst, and keep thy things in order\r\n and don’t leave one thing here and another there, and tell the other\r\n boy to do the same. It would be well that both of you should order a\r\n pair of shoes from P. Thou hast a pair of hose with the shoes, but he\r\n has not. So I send thee a pair of his oldest hose which button on to\r\n the shoes. Tell the bearer who it was that sent thee those new shoes\r\n which do not fit, and he will inform Francesco Martelli who ordered\r\n them for thee. If thou hast aught to send in the bag of Antonio\r\n Martelli’s messenger do so, unless it is something that has to pay\r\n duty. I was going to send some cloth hose, but as thou art coming back\r\n so soon I shall not trouble about them. Let me know what thou sendest\r\n by the messenger. No more. God guard thee.--Florence, the 14th day of\r\n October 1438.[41]\r\n\r\nThe two following documents relate to the celebrated Council of the\r\nChurch which met at Florence during Cosimo’s second term of office as\r\nGonfalonier, or chief magistrate. The Œcumenical Council of Basel had\r\nactually come into conflict with Pope Eugenius, in the end deposed him,\r\nand declared the papal chair vacant. Whereupon Eugenius ordered the\r\nCouncil to transfer its sittings to Ferrara, excommunicated all its\r\nmembers who refused to obey and packed the assembly with his adherents.\r\nBut a pestilence broke out at Ferrara, and proposals were made to bring\r\nthe assembled ecclesiastics to Florence. The citizens were eagerly\r\nexcited, for both the Patriarch and the Emperor of Constantinople\r\nwere expected to attend. The Pope arrived in Florence on January 2nd,\r\n1439-40, the Patriarch on the 12th, and the Emperor John Palæologus\r\non the 15th February (the entry of the latter is represented in the\r\nfresco in the chapel of the Riccardi palace), and were all sumptuously\r\nlodged. The essential findings of this Council are important, for they\r\nwere reproduced in the Canons of Trent. It was supposed to unite the\r\nGreek and Latin Churches, but its real result was to introduce the\r\nItalians to ancient Greek literature, and, if such things can be dated,\r\nit marks the beginning of the Italian Renaissance.\r\n\r\nCosimo’s brother Lorenzo de’ Medici was sent to Ferrara in December\r\n1438 to arrange with the Pope about transferring the Œcumenic Council\r\nto Florence. The instructions given by the Signory are curious and show\r\nhow burdensome the Councils were to the cities in which they were held.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommissio Laurentii de’ Medicis, _3 Decembris 1438_\r\n\r\n Thou art to go to Ferrara and present thyself at the feet of H.H.\r\n Pope Eugenius, commending to him our city, and this Signoria and our\r\n whole people, as faithful and devout sons of Holy Church and of His\r\n Holiness, offering our city and our people to His Holiness.\r\n\r\n To descend now to substantial matters; thou wilt say that this\r\n Signoria has heard that His Holiness is inclined to come to Florence\r\n with his Court, and the Greeks, and the other members of the Council\r\n gathered together there. Having heard this the Signoria send thee to\r\n H.H. to devoutly offer our city as the residence and the abode of H.H.\r\n and his Court and the others above mentioned; being moved thereto, as\r\n in all matters, by their special devotion towards H.H.\r\n\r\n Should His Sanctity ask anything special for the Greeks thou wilt\r\n answer that we shall willingly provide houses for them gratis,\r\n without demanding any rent, and that we shall strive to render the\r\n houses suitable for their various degrees of nobility. If money for\r\n the maintenance of the Greeks is mentioned, which we hear amounts to\r\n 1500 florins a month, thou art to say that our Commune is very short\r\n of money on account of the long war, &c., and for this reason our\r\n Commune would be most grateful not to be burdened, but nevertheless\r\n if absolutely necessary we are ready to lend H.H. the said amount of\r\n 1500 florins, or of ducats, every month, on receipt of a promise and\r\n valid security as to repayment at a given date, to be agreed upon by\r\n both parties. For as the Greeks come on business of the Church, it is\r\n only reasonable that the Church should pay and bear the burden. It is\r\n enough if we advance the money every month, which will only be repaid\r\n after some time. Otherwise it would seem as though we had bought his\r\n visit, which would not be at all to the honour of our Commune, and we\r\n are certain His Sanctity does not desire us to do anything which would\r\n be dishonourable to our Commune.\r\n\r\n We consent to begin the payment of 1500 florins, or ducats, per month,\r\n from the day the Greeks leave Ferrara, and to continue it while they\r\n are in Florence, but not for more than eight months.\r\n\r\n If agreements and conventions for the Court are mentioned, such as\r\n taxes on houses, jurisdiction, immunity from excise duties in and out\r\n of the town and such things, and houses for the Lord Cardinals, &c.,\r\n thou art to say we are ready to concede everything that is reasonable\r\n and just, and that the last time H.H. was at Florence with his Court,\r\n agreements and conventions were made, and the same thing can be done\r\n now. When H.H. is here we can settle, and add or correct whatever is\r\n reasonable on one side and the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Additio facta Commissioni Laurentii de’ Medicis_\r\n\r\n Lorenzo, thou seest the commissions we have given thee in the full\r\n instructions. Strive to carry them out. But if the Pope insists\r\n on having money for the expenses of the Greeks without giving any\r\n security or promise to repay, reduce the various amounts as much as\r\n possible, so as not to exceed 1500 ducats a month, or at the utmost\r\n 1700; to begin when the Court arrives here, or, that being impossible,\r\n when they leave Ferrara, and then only promise money for eight months\r\n and no longer.\r\n\r\n If the Pope will not consent to the agreements about his Court\r\n mentioned in thy instructions being drawn up here, ask what he\r\n demands, and look at the conventions conceded to him when he was here\r\n last, and act upon those within certain limits, for some of them need\r\n revision. The necessary changes have been noted at the end of each\r\n article.\r\n\r\n The Signoria think the Pope ought gladly to promise and to give\r\n security for the repayment of the money used for the expenses of the\r\n Greeks; reason and justice demand this, therefore do thy best in this\r\n matter, so shalt thou reap honour and the Republic benefit by thy\r\n intelligence and industry. Should the Pope ask for any security for\r\n his own person or that of others, see that thou understandest clearly\r\n the nature of such security and write to us here; we will then do what\r\n His Sanctity wishes.[42]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancesco Sforza _to_ Cosimo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice vir et tanquam Pater honorandissime_,--If I have erred\r\n in writing my humble opinion to Your Magnificence, I beg you will\r\n not attribute it to presumption, but rather to my fidelity, and to\r\n affection for the State of our Lord the Pope and for your Commune.\r\n I do not deal in occult secrets, but speak of what I have seen\r\n in the past while weighing present events, which are by no means\r\n clear. Believe me, Cosimo, my motives are not dictated by passion,\r\n because I am the devoted and faithful servant of our Holy Father, of\r\n Holy Church, and especially of Monsignore the Florentine Cardinal,\r\n therefore I think the present opposition of His Reverence to the\r\n Lord of Foligno is, _sententia mea_, not only untimely but dangerous\r\n to the State of His Holiness and may be also to yours. I do not say\r\n this to excuse the errors of the said Lord, indeed if it were of any\r\n use I would blame him, but to try and ward off imminent danger. You\r\n know the position of Foligno, her Lord can do much damage with even\r\n a small number of men. The Perugians are suspicious, and suspicion\r\n is a malady one cannot doctor, so that a great disaster and much\r\n trouble may arise in the land, and it is ill fighting with desperate\r\n men. Believe me that other lords and communes are as suspicious as\r\n the Perugians, each one is intent on guarding his own State, and\r\n the discords of parties here are not good for the State of our Holy\r\n Father, for Holy Church, or for your Commune. It seems to me that for\r\n the common good Monsignore the Cardinal should rather attend to the\r\n conquest of Romagna; he could do nothing more useful, it would cut the\r\n passage of the Ducal troops, and it is no longer a good frontier for\r\n the League or for you gentlemen of Florence. If ever the possession\r\n of Romagna was necessary it is so now, considering the action of the\r\n Council towards His Sanctity; although from what I hear it will not\r\n lead to much, still it unsettles the minds of the people, and Italy\r\n is altogether in a disturbed condition, as you see. The establishment\r\n of Romagna as a barrier would be a great boon to the State of His\r\n Holiness, to the Church, and to yourselves; if we do not strike when\r\n we can, when we wish to do so it will be too late. Remember that the\r\n last time we fell out with the Lord of Foligno he obtained help from\r\n troops in Romagna; had they been in Lombardy they would not have\r\n come, indeed they could not. I pass over many things which it would\r\n be difficult to answer, but I beg of you, Cosimo, to think over this,\r\n which touches your Republic very closely, and of all the troubles\r\n which are brewing or which may brew from the Alps downwards; do your\r\n best to find a remedy, and you will be the author of peace and quiet\r\n in all Tuscany. You may rest assured, Cosimo, that I write in all\r\n sincerity and truth, without subterfuge, if you will believe me. Not\r\n only my small faculties but my life is at the service of our Holy\r\n Father and of Holy Church, and also at that of your Commune. One thing\r\n I will not conceal, and that is that I suspect this enterprise of\r\n Foligno is distasteful to the Illustrious Count, and having entered\r\n with such goodwill and liberality into the affair, great caution must\r\n be used not to do anything he would dislike. I write all this not\r\n with the desire of pleasing or of displeasing any one, but to satisfy\r\n myself, as I conceive it to be my bounden duty, seeing the affection\r\n shown me by His Holiness and by Monsignore your Cardinal, and the\r\n great benefits I have received from your Commune. I should be very\r\n glad if you would impart what I have written, if it so pleases you, to\r\n Neri di Gino and to Piero di Messer Luigi. Be assured, Cosimo, that\r\n for good reasons I do not mention many things which I well understand.\r\n Offering myself, &c.--Siena, July 20, 1439, _manu propria_.[43]\r\n\r\n\r\nContessina de’ Medici _to her son_ Giovanni _at the Baths of Petriolo_\r\n[_near Siena_]\r\n\r\n Most dear Son,--The reason I write is that this morning at table\r\n Cosimo told me that Maestro Mariotto had gone to spend eight days with\r\n thee, and said that when Maestro M. returns he will let me come to\r\n be with thee, so I pray thee to ask him to remain with thee as long\r\n as thou art there, as I think thou hast need of him, and also Cosimo\r\n is well pleased that he should remain, and bids thee arrange so that\r\n he may be content. Let me know, for if he comes away nothing shall\r\n prevent my coming, for on no account will I permit thee to be there\r\n without him or me, so tell me his intentions. Had I known when he left\r\n I would have saved him the trouble and come myself. Tell me whether\r\n thou hadst rain on the day of thy departure, and if thou hast need of\r\n anything write to me.

There are many splendid palaces, houses, tombs, and\r\n temples, and other edifices in infinite number, but all are in ruins;\r\n much porphyry and marble from ancient buildings, and every day these\r\n marbles are destroyed by being burnt for lime in scandalous fashion.\r\n What is modern is poor stuff, that is to say the buildings; the beauty\r\n of Rome lies in what is in ruin. The men of the present day, who call\r\n themselves Romans, are very different in bearing and in conduct from\r\n the ancient inhabitants. _Breviter loquendo_, they all look like\r\n cowherds. Their women are generally handsome in face; all the rest is\r\n uncommonly dirty; the reason, they tell me, is that they all cook.\r\n They seem agreeable, but one seldom sees them. Amusements there are\r\n none, save to go to these pardons (indulgences) which are perpetual,\r\n and in these days of Lent the women frequent them, as well as those\r\n who, like me, have nothing else to do.\r\n\r\n _Ex Urbe delacerata_ (From the ruined City), 22nd March 1443 (1444).\r\n\r\n\r\nContessina de’ Medici _to her son_ Giovanni _in Rome_\r\n\r\n Since thy departure I have no news of thee save from one who saw thee\r\n when leaving Siena, and who said thou wert well. I know not how thou\r\n hast fared, as the weather has not been favourable, but by now thou\r\n must be near Rome. I trust God has guided thee in safety; this week\r\n has seemed to me like a year. Therefore I pray thee let me know how\r\n thou art, and whether the journey has fatigued thee. Remember above\r\n all to have care of thyself, and if thou needest aught from here let\r\n me know. We are all well, thanks be to God. I say no more. God protect\r\n thee.--The 21st day of February 1444 (1445).\r\n\r\n                                                    Mona Contessina.[46]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Same to the Same_\r\n\r\n\r\n To-day I received thy letter, and see that thou art well: please God\r\n to preserve thee so. It has been told me that fever has begun there as\r\n it did last summer; I pray thee if there be any danger come away, for\r\n Roman fevers are bad. Remember Bartolommeo di Nanni di Nettolo, he had\r\n enough of them: do not wait to fall ill, as Piero did at Ferrara.\r\n\r\n I have a jar of excellent raisins, and will send it in a few days;\r\n when it arrives see that it is given to Monsignore di Capora.\r\n\r\n Lucrezia is well, she is stouter and altogether improved; she bids me\r\n remind you of her salve. Shouldst thou need anything I can do for thee\r\n tell me. Pray to those holy relics and to the Pardons, especially to\r\n the Holy Face (_Sudario_), to give thee holiness.\r\n\r\n Tell Riccio his people are well, and that I caused capons, spices,\r\n saffron, and comfits to be given to the women for the confinement;\r\n and Matteo, who has just come from the Mugello, says that he has sent\r\n stakes for his vineyard.

The hat I sent thee by Benedetto\r\n Altoviti. The other things I will send next week. I have received\r\n the steaks, the hams and the salted meat thou hast sent. I write so\r\n shortly because the messenger is going off in haste. No more. God keep\r\n thee.--From Florence on the 11th day of April 1445.\r\n\r\n                                                      La Contessina.[49]\r\n\r\nThe following is the first letter from Lucrezia, the devoted wife\r\nof Piero de’ Medici (the Gouty). She was the daughter of Cosimo de’\r\nMedici’s intimate friend, Francesco Tornabuoni, and must have been a\r\nremarkable woman. Cosimo had a high opinion of her ability; after his\r\ndeath in 1464 her husband consulted her on all political questions, and\r\nwhen she was absent kept her minutely informed about passing events.\r\nShe corresponded with many of the literary men of her time, was no mean\r\npoetess, and many of her sacred plays and lauds were very popular.\r\nNiccolò Valori praises her rare eloquence and her translations from\r\nHoly Writ into the vulgar tongue. She was also an excellent housewife,\r\nand by her tact, goodness, and kindly manners did much to preserve the\r\npre-eminence of the Medici. The education of her children occupied her\r\ngreatly, and few princes of that day were brought up like Lorenzo and\r\nGiuliano. Lucrezia’s deep religious feeling was tempered by a joyous,\r\nmerry nature, which comes out in her letters, and accounts for the\r\naffection she inspired in so many and such different people. It is\r\nstrange that no authentic portrait of her is known. One cannot help\r\nthinking she must be depicted in Ghirlandajo’s fresco in the choir of\r\nS. Maria Novella representing the life of S. John the Baptist, which\r\nshe narrated in her poem _La Vita di San Giovanni Battista_. The more\r\nso that the fresco was commissioned by her brother Giovanni Tornabuoni,\r\nand contains many portraits of his family and of friends and dependants\r\nof the Medici. It is true it was painted a few years after her death,\r\nstill her image cannot have faded so rapidly from recollection.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici, _at the Baths of Petriolo, to her husband_ Piero\r\n_at Florence_\r\n\r\n Lord and Master mine,--Yesterday I had a letter from thee advising\r\n me what to do about the baths. I had already settled to do all thou\r\n sayest in thy letter and whatever Maestro Giovanni orders; nothing\r\n will seem fatiguing or irksome to me for regaining my health, which I\r\n believe by the grace of God will improve, so I think you will all be\r\n well pleased.\r\n\r\n I see thou hast purged thyself and art going to the villa, of which I\r\n am glad; be careful to keep well and do not give way to melancholy,\r\n for I shall return cured and do honour to Maestro Giovanni, to whom I\r\n show much attention, for he deserves it.\r\n\r\n If thy coming here can be done without fatigue and with pleasure\r\n to thyself it would be a great joy to me, but if troublesome and\r\n fatiguing to thee, do not come. I am glad Bianca Maria has recovered;\r\n how I pray to God that she may continue well as thou, I, and her\r\n husband desire, I leave thee to imagine. To Mona Nanna and to Filippo\r\n I have given greetings and they commend themselves to thee and to all;\r\n commend me to Cosimo, to Mona Contessina, Mona Ginevra, and Giovanni,\r\n and salute Pier Francesco and kiss Bianca Maria from me. Christ guard\r\n us.--In Petriolo, May 17, 1446.\r\n\r\n If without trouble and it pleases thee, thou canst spare Franceschino\r\n for the remaining time I am here, I should be very glad, as he is most\r\n useful to me in this place, but whatever pleases thee pleases me.[50]\r\n\r\n                           ✕ Al nome di Dio.\r\n\r\n Domine et maggiore mio, ieri ebbi una tua per quella m’avisi del\r\n governo mio intorno a fatti del bangno ero diliberato far tanto quanto\r\n m’avisi per la letera tua et quanto per maestro Giovanni mi sarà\r\n ricordato et non mi parà faticha ne disagio niuna chosa per la santa\r\n la quale credo, gratia di dio, che n’arà a seguire per modo che credo\r\n che tutti ne sarete ben chontenti.\r\n\r\n Vego ti se’ purgato et vaitene in villa che mi piace et chonfortoti a\r\n stare sano et non ti dare manichonia che tornerò guarita.

I understand thy letter and also trust that God will bestow\r\n this grace upon us, and I send thee capers. Giovanni[52] wanted to\r\n go at all hazards to-day to see Lucrezia and the children: he says\r\n too that he has hardly seen thee. With difficulty I prevented him so\r\n that he might not be over-tired. Tell Lucrezia that the child’s frock\r\n shall be re-lined and she shall have it on Monday, and that she must\r\n encourage the baby to suck and have a care of all the children. Cosimo\r\n is well: this morning his knee pained him a little, a touch of the\r\n gout; but it will soon pass, as it is but a slight thing. If Lucrezia\r\n or thou shouldst want anything let me know. No more. Christ guard\r\n thee.--In Florence on the 6th day of February 1449 (1450).\r\n\r\n                                        Mona Contessina in Florence.[53]\r\n\r\n\r\nContessina de’ Medici _to her son_ Giovanni _in Rome_\r\n\r\n Most dear Son,--As there was no need I have not written since thy\r\n departure. Now it seems to me necessary, because we hear the plague\r\n is causing many deaths, even among the well-to-do. I must beg thee\r\n for God’s sake and for the sake of the love I bear thee to return as\r\n soon as thou canst. Thou knowest how anxious Cosimo and I are about\r\n thy stay in Rome; thy brother also is anxious. Had Cosimo known that\r\n plague was there he would never have let thee go. Cosimo has perpetual\r\n fever as he had when thou didst leave him, and these doctors call\r\n gout fever, and have done so for some time as thou knowest, and one\r\n can never be sure what may happen from one day to another. Therefore\r\n I beseech thee to return as quickly as thou canst, for thou art well\r\n aware how much he has to do. More I will not write to-day. Piero and\r\n his family have gone to Careggi because he also has fever. Tell me how\r\n thy ailment is? I will add no more.--In Florence 24th February 1449\r\n (1450). From thy\r\n\r\n                                         Mona Contessina di’ Cosimo.[54]\r\n\r\n\r\nCosimo de’ Medici _to_ Giovanni _his son in Rome_\r\n\r\n With my own hand I wrote thee a letter on the 21st: since then I\r\n have had two letters from thee announcing thy safe arrival, and that\r\n thou art trying to obtain the indulgences in order to come away. I\r\n advise thee to do so with all possible speed, for although thou sayest\r\n that the death of the Bishop of Volterra has not changed matters,\r\n other letters I have seen declare the contrary; a prolonged stay is\r\n therefore not advisable.\r\n\r\n The affectionate manner in which our Holy Father received thee, and\r\n what thou sayest as to the love he bears us, is most grateful to me. I\r\n see by his reply that thou hast told him what I said, that we are not\r\n idle and will do all we can to persuade them to follow the counsels\r\n of His Holiness. But it will be difficult, because if either party\r\n thinks to gain anything he will not abide by the agreement. What the\r\n Venetians want and what the Count wants is of such importance to them\r\n that nothing else will be regarded as of any moment. We have sent\r\n Messer A. and are leaving no means untried to reconcile them, as we\r\n know how important it is to our city.\r\n\r\n Messer Agniolo Simonetto and Messer N. Arimboldi sent to the King by\r\n the Count with powers to sign the compact will have arrived; I know\r\n not what is thought of it there, but we shall soon hear the truth.\r\n\r\n From Lombardy letters have come from the Count of the 19th, dated\r\n from Vimercato. He reports that with his whole force he is there and\r\n at Melzi and Casciano and other places near by, and that Milan is\r\n so surrounded that no supplies can enter. The Venetian troops are\r\n encamped in the positions he held at first, and one sees that both\r\n armies are suffering much discomfort. Any attempt to revictual Milan\r\n must be made by ascending from the heights into the plain and passing\r\n by the places held by the Count, when there would be fighting. They\r\n say Milan is in dire straits. Other news there are none, and we\r\n know not what is said there. Innocenzio Cotta has taken the town and\r\n fortress of S. Calombano for the Count, which it seems is a place of\r\n importance. Nothing more is said about our peace with the King, and to\r\n my sorrow there is a coolness about sending ambassadors. Pray God it\r\n may be for the best.\r\n\r\n I see Messer Giovanni di Nerone is to have the bishopric of Volterra;\r\n I hope he may do well. If Messer Carlo[55] gets the Parish Church[56]\r\n I do not mind. I did not wish to ask for the canonry of Messer\r\n Giovanni which is in the gift of the Consuls, as many citizens wanted\r\n it. With this I send thee a letter from Messer Giovanni Migliorati\r\n received to-day. Thou wilt see what he writes. If this be true, and\r\n it can be had for Messer Carlo, it would be well. If thou thinkest it\r\n might be of use, speak to His Holiness about it and try to obtain a\r\n conditional promise, I would then let thee know at once if the event\r\n occurs: for our Holy Father shows us such affection that it seems to\r\n me unwise not to ask if one can get anything. No more at present.\r\n Christ guard thee.--In Florence on the last day of February 1449\r\n (1450).\r\n\r\n                                                  Cosimo de’ Medici.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\nContessina de’ Medici _to_ Giovanni _her son at Volterra_\r\n\r\n In the name of God on the 18th day of December 1450.\r\n\r\n Yesterday I had a letter from thee. The things thou wantest shall\r\n all be sent by the first man going to Volterra. Cosimo continues to\r\n improve; he has not been very ill this time, although the fever has\r\n not yet left him, but it is slight. Thy shoes were ready, but they\r\n have made them black, so others must be made, and I will send them\r\n by the first messenger. We have not yet heard of the arrival of our\r\n party, but one who met them on the road says they were well: as soon\r\n as I hear I will let thee know. Although I told thee we paid too much\r\n for the pigs, I want thee to send us a pig or a roe for Christmas,\r\n if they are offered to thee; if we have to buy them we will not have\r\n them. Messer Rosello writes that he is coming to pass Christmas with\r\n me, and has sent Cosimo a fine cloak of Polish fashion of marten and\r\n sable, a pair of gloves, and the tooth of a fish a foot and a half\r\n long. As we have to prepare for the festival of the Three Kings, they\r\n will make a little change from my cloth of gold.\r\n\r\n The plague affects us but little. For three days out of four during\r\n the week no one mentions it, they are all people one does not know. I\r\n should be so glad to know how thou art, and whether thou art better or\r\n worse since thy departure. Thy return, when it takes place, will be a\r\n great joy to me.\r\n\r\n Antonio degl’ Strozzi has been to see me, and pestered me much about\r\n that business: he wants to come here for Christmas, tell him what\r\n thou thinkest; and so be he says that I promised him anything do not\r\n believe it, for he could learn nothing from me: so be cautious how\r\n thou dealest with him.\r\n\r\n Tell the women I do not write because there is a dearth of writers\r\n until Mateo returns from Rome, he ought to be here to-morrow. Salute\r\n them from me, and say many things, and caress the children and kiss\r\n them for love of me; if the women want anything I can send, tell me.\r\n No more at present. God guard thee.\r\n\r\n                                        Mona Contessina in Florence.[58]\r\n\r\n\r\nContessina de’ Medici _to her son_ Giovanni _at Volterra_\r\n\r\n In the name of God on the 3rd day of January 1450 (1451).\r\n\r\n Most dear Son,---I only write this because for several days I have not\r\n had a letter, and because I thought Antonio degl’ Strozzi was coming\r\n back, and from him I might have heard news of thee. But Michele has\r\n been here, and says that since Friday thou hast been expecting the\r\n party from Rome. So I write to tell thee that it is impossible they\r\n could arrive because they were expected at Siena that evening. By now\r\n they ought to be with thee; if they are do not fail to tell us how\r\n they fare, for Roberto wrote to Cosimo that they left last Friday. If\r\n they come here we shall send thee word. No more at present. Christ\r\n protect thee. Written in haste.\r\n\r\n                                        Mona Contessina in Florence.[59]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Same to the Same_\r\n\r\n In the name of God on the 5th day of January 1450 (1451).\r\n\r\n The other day I wrote to thee in haste, and have now heard of the\r\n arrival of Piero and Pier Francesco.[60] God be praised. We shall be\r\n much rejoiced if they have returned in good health: I hear Piero’s\r\n foot has given him some trouble. I know not what thou hast decided\r\n about staying or returning; if thou dost return here put all thy\r\n belongings together in one place, so that if they are wanted thou\r\n wilt not be obliged to ask those women to find them, and so drive\r\n them crazy. I think Cosimo has written to thee about the strong box\r\n he wants. Here the plague has ceased, and I am glad thou art coming\r\n back; although it might be well to stay a little longer and see how\r\n thy health goes, but thou canst always return there if necessary.\r\n Tell me thy decision. I wrote the day before yesterday to ask thee to\r\n search in the cupboard in my room there for a pair of scissors which\r\n belong to Cosimo and to bring them, or they can be put into the strong\r\n box. No more to-day. Salute Pier Francesco from me, and tell him he is\r\n welcome back, and that I long to see him. Christ guard thee.\r\n\r\n                                        Mona Contessina in Florence.[61]\r\n\r\nWhen, after the death of Visconti, Francesco Sforza had attained the\r\nobject of his ambition and become Duke of Milan in 1450, Cosimo sent\r\nhis eldest son Piero with Neri Capponi, Luca Pitti, and Diotisalvi\r\nNeroni, to salute the new duke. “They proceeded in triumph,” writes\r\nCambi, “through the Milanese territory, and all their expenses were\r\npaid. The number of horsemen was so great when they arrived within five\r\nmiles of Milan that it seemed like a manœuvring ground. Then the Duke\r\nin person advanced to meet them, and embraced and kissed them. Never\r\nwas greater honour paid to Florentine ambassadors.”[62]\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici was also one of the citizens deputed to meet the\r\nEmperor Frederick III. on his entry into Florence in January 1451. He\r\ndismounted at the church of S. Gallo, which had been magnificently\r\ndecorated with hangings of cloth of gold and silk. In his train was\r\nthe poor boy-King of Hungary, Bandilagho, as Cambi writes Ladislaus,\r\nand many German princes and bishops, whose outlandish names are quite\r\nbeyond the old chronicler’s powers of spelling. “The Emperor seated\r\nhimself,” continues Cambi, “on a most splendid chair under the loggia\r\nof the church, and all the gentlemen stood round him while the Ten\r\nof the Balìa bent the knee before him on either side, representing\r\nthe Magnificent Signori. Messer Carlo d’Arezzo made a speech, to\r\nwhich Monsignore Enea, Bishop of Siena [the celebrated Æneas Sylvius,\r\nafterwards Pope Pius II.], replied in the name of the Emperor. Then the\r\nEmperor mounted again, and the Ten of the Balìa took the bridle of his\r\nhorse, and in that manner they proceeded to the fore-port of the Porta\r\nS. Gallo where the Magnificent Signori of Florence awaited him seated.\r\nThe Colleges had a fine banner with the Emperor’s arms, and when he\r\ncame under it the Signori rose and went to his bridle, which the Ten\r\nabandoned. Mariotto Benvenuti, the Gonfalonier of Justice, took the\r\nright side and Rosso Ridolfi took the left, the other Signori with all\r\nthe citizens following them, and thus they accompanied the Emperor to\r\nS. Maria Novella where the Pope’s apartments had been prepared for him.\r\nThe magistrates were on foot, and the others who had gone out to meet\r\nhim were on horseback. It was, indeed, a splendid sight. Please God he\r\nmay recognise it, and be grateful for such honours which have been so\r\ncostly.”[63]\r\n\r\nAfter the sack of Constantinople in 1453 Florence became the\r\nheadquarters of Greek men of learning. For fifteen years John\r\nArgyropoulos “poured forth wisdom from his golden mouth,” and Demetrius\r\nChalcondyles, Johannes Andronicus Calistus, Constantius and Johannes\r\nLascari succeeded him. They gave a fresh impetus to the study of\r\nPlatonic philosophy as opposed to that of Aristotle; even the children\r\nof the chief citizens spoke Greek with such case and purity that\r\nPoliziano exclaims, “Athens has not been destroyed by the barbarians\r\nbut has migrated to Florence.” It was then that Cosimo determined to\r\nfound the celebrated Platonic Academy, and selected Marsilio Ficino,\r\nthe son of his physician, to preside over it, although he was little\r\nmore than a boy.\r\n\r\nThe sack of Lodi gave Cosimo’s opponents an opportunity to interfere\r\nin home politics. Their first step in June 1454, on the pretext that\r\nwar was over, was to abolish the Balìa, which they imagined was the\r\nmainstay of his authority. This, of course, was useless as long as\r\nthe Scrutiny made by the Balìa and the Accopiatori appointed by them\r\nwere still in office. In November, therefore, a new Scrutiny was made,\r\nand in January 1455 the new Signory ordered that in six months’ time\r\nthe power of the Accopiatori should cease, and the Gonfalonier and\r\nthe Priors be once more chosen by lot. The measure was a popular one,\r\nand it worked, not against Cosimo, but against Luca Pitti, Diotisalvi\r\nNeroni, and Agnolo Acciaiuoli, as it put an end to their power of\r\nmanipulating the appointments to office. The disturbed condition\r\nof Italy after the death of Pope Nicholas the peace-lover, and the\r\ndischarge by the Venetians of Jacopo Piccinino, whose standard became\r\nthe rallying-point for all discontented and dissatisfied men, reacted\r\nupon Florence. A feeling of unrest was abroad. Many citizens considered\r\nthe Government weak and vacillating, and were only waiting for the\r\nelection of a Signory who shared their views to make an attempt to\r\n“reform” the city. But without the consent of Neri Capponi this was\r\nimpossible. So things remained as they were until his death in 1457\r\nleft Cosimo with a free hand. The re-assessment of the _catasto_\r\nearly in 1458 was a heavy blow to his opponents, the new register\r\nof property entailing upon them considerable loss. In their dismay\r\nthey turned to Cosimo, and suggested the creation of a new Balìa, a\r\nnew Scrutiny, and fresh Accopiatori, but he refused to listen to any\r\nproposal for the renewal of the Balìa save in the usual way through\r\nthe Colleges and the Councils. When Luca Pitti became Gonfalonier of\r\nJustice in 1458 he tried in vain to induce the Council to appoint a new\r\nBalìa, and Girolamo Machiavelli, a hot-headed republican who declared\r\nagainst all Balìe as inimical to the freedom of the citizens, was\r\narrested and tortured with others who shared his views. Luca Pitti made\r\nthe most of this so-called conspiracy, and tried to set his authority\r\nagainst that of Cosimo. Losing patience, Cosimo said to him: “You\r\nstrive towards the indefinite, I towards the definite. You plant your\r\nladder in the air, I place mine on the earth so that I may not climb\r\nso high as to fall. It seems to me but just and natural that I should\r\ndesire the honour and reputation of my house to surpass yours. Let\r\nus therefore do like two big dogs which sniff one at the other when\r\nthey meet, and then, both having teeth, separate and go their ways;\r\nyou to attend to your concerns, I to look after mine own.” Cosimo\r\nthen summoned a parliament. His position can be gauged by the advice\r\ngiven to Duke Sforza by his Ambassador to Florence: “When you would\r\nhave one thing done rather than another, write your opinion or your\r\ndesire privately to Cosimo, and he will always arrange it for you.\r\nDo not waste your time in saying, I would have their opinion, &c....\r\nPopular governments are alien to and diverse from others, and Cosimo\r\ncannot be for ever in the Palace as he once was.” Pope Pius II. also\r\ndeclared, “Nothing is denied to Cosimo. He is the arbiter of peace and\r\nof war, and the moderator of the laws. Not so much a private citizen\r\nas the lord of the country. The policy of the Republic is discussed in\r\nhis house; he it is who gives commands to the magistrates. Nought of\r\nroyalty is wanting to him save the name and the state of a king.”\r\n\r\n\r\nContessina de’ Medici _to_ Ginevra, _wife of her son_ Giovanni, _at the\r\nBaths of Petriolo_\r\n\r\n Dearest Daughter,--In these days I received a letter from thee and\r\n learn thou art well, which rejoices me. I see that thou art preparing\r\n to return, it seems to me a thousand years. Piero is going there now,\r\n so leave out the things he may need, and leave Florino and Giannello\r\n and give over everything to them in case thou comest away before Piero\r\n arrives; he will need a good many days for the cure of his eczema. The\r\n curtains thou tookest away bring back to me here, for Mona Lucrezia\r\n takes mine with her, and some slaves from here, so she will need no\r\n other women. Thy boy is well and has cut two teeth, and I think will\r\n get accustomed to these wet nurses in such a way ...[64] night and day\r\n we see after him. It seems to me that having cut his teeth and the\r\n evenings being warm he will do well. I say no more. May Christ guard\r\n thee.--In Florence on the 10th day of April 1455.\r\n\r\n                                          Mona Contessina di Cosimo.[65]\r\n\r\n\r\nCosimo de’ Medici _to his son_ Giovanni _at Milan_\r\n\r\n During the last days I have written thee several letters, but have\r\n only had one from thee from Modena. We have heard of thy arrival at\r\n Milan, and of the great honours paid thee by the Duke, at which I am\r\n well pleased.\r\n\r\n I expect to hear from thee how things passed.\r\n\r\n As I told thee, and as I have written to thee, I do not at all desire\r\n that thou shouldest go further in order to accompany the Duke of\r\n Calabria. We should lose more here than we should gain there by this.\r\n Thou hast already done quite enough by accompanying him hitherto,\r\n without going any further, and next month thou must return here. No\r\n more at present. Christ guard thee.--Florence, July 28, 1455.\r\n\r\n                                                  Cosimo de’ Medici.[66]\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici (_from Careggi or Cafaggiuolo_) _to her husband_\r\nPiero _at Florence_\r\n\r\n This day I received thy letter, which is most dear to me as telling\r\n how thou art. I see that by the grace of God riding has not been too\r\n irksome to thee, of which I am glad. Mona Contessina told me the\r\n same, and that thou hast been received with great demonstrations of\r\n affection. Truly, as thou sayest, we have much to thank God for. So\r\n I beg thee to bear gladly a little discomfort, for these things are\r\n not accomplished without some fatigue. I see all the family is well,\r\n which is a great consolation to hear, and I thank thee. I beg that,\r\n as we are not coming there, thou wilt return as soon as thou canst,\r\n for it seems to us a thousand years since we saw thee, particularly\r\n to Giuliano. Lorenzo is learning the verses his master there gave\r\n him and then teaches them to Giuliano. No more at present. Commend\r\n me to Cosimo and to Mona Contessina. We are all well. Christ guard\r\n thee.--28th February 1457 (1458).\r\n\r\n                                                       Thy Lucrezia.[67]\r\n\r\nThe entry into Florence of Galeazzo Maria, Count of Pavia, son of\r\nFrancesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, is described in a curious poem written\r\nin 1459 by an unknown author.[68] Leaving Cafaggiuolo, where the lad\r\nslept, he entered Florence on 17th April 1459, and dismounted at the\r\nMedici palace. Next day Messer Galeazzo visited the Signoria, who made\r\nhim sit in their midst and offered him their services. “I thank you for\r\nyour greeting,” answered the young Count, “and beg you to command me\r\nand to dispose of all I possess. For you I will abandon any enterprise,\r\nand serve you against any power.” Then with a prayer to God to grant\r\nthem happiness and long lives the lad of fifteen added: “I beg you to\r\npardon my youth if, from want of knowledge, I have not spoken aright\r\nin your presence; remember I am but a boy. I commend you to Christ\r\nour Lord.” From his letters to his father we get a glimpse of the home\r\nlife of Cosimo. He writes that even the ladies of the family helped to\r\nentertain him, and he was charmed with the playing of one of Piero’s\r\ndaughters on the “organo di cave.” At a dinner at Careggi he notes\r\nthat Giovanni, Cosimo’s second son, did not sit at table, but acted as\r\na kind of steward, and saw that every one was properly served. After\r\ndinner a poet improvised verses in honour of the guest. “Certes, Lucian\r\nor Dante could have done no better,” he remarks. Then they danced,\r\nPiero’s wife Lucrezia Tornabuoni, Giovanni’s Maria Ginevra degl’\r\nAlessandri, and a daughter of the Strozzi, held to be the handsomest\r\nmaiden in Florence, and some peasant girls.\r\n\r\nTwo days later came Pope Pius II. on his way to the Congress he had\r\nsummoned at Mantua to arrange for another crusade. He was received\r\nwith great honour, and young Sforza made an oration, kneeling in the\r\ndust before the Pope. Then Pius seated himself on a gestatory chair\r\nand was borne into the city on the shoulders of the lords of Faenza,\r\nRimini, Carpi, and Forli, instead of riding on a mule, which was the\r\nusual practice. “This,” observes Cambi, “was a proof of pride, not of\r\nholiness.” The old chronicler then describes a tournament in the Piazza\r\nS. Croce “for the temporal lords, but many ecclesiastics also went. And\r\non 29th April there was a ball in the Mercato Nuovo, which was enclosed\r\nwith a stockade surrounded by seats covered with tapestry. Sixty young\r\nFlorentine gentlemen, who were expert dancers, richly adorned with\r\npearls and jewels, and many pretty maidens and girls who were good\r\ndancers, danced; and they changed their dresses several times. All the\r\nambassadors were there and some of the cardinals, and it was calculated\r\nthat in the seats, in the houses round, and on foot, there were more\r\nthan 60,000 persons. There was also a great hunt in the Piazza de’\r\nSignori, which was closed all round with a stockade, and inside were\r\nturned loose two lions, two horses, four bulls, two young buffaloes,\r\na cow and a calf, a wild boar, a giraffe, with twenty men and a large\r\nball of wood, so made that a man could stand upright inside and roll\r\nit about in order to exasperate the animals. But the loud shouts of\r\nthe people so frightened the lions that they were as though stupefied,\r\nmany men broke into the enclosure and the lions were as lambs among\r\nthem. The preparations had been great, and the expense large, but the\r\npleasure given was small.”[69]\r\n\r\n\r\nContessina de’ Medici _to her son_ Piero _at Venice_\r\n\r\n Dearest Son,--This day I have received thy letter saying that thou art\r\n well and improving every day, which rejoices me. I think thou must\r\n wish for news of Cosimo. Some days ago he had a bad attack of plague.\r\n He is ill in bed, but this time he has escaped and now the fever is\r\n slight. I hear that thou hast bought the quilts and the ticking, which\r\n is well done. If thou wouldst like to send them to Careggi, I [will\r\n keep them][70] until thy return. Do as thou wilt. The other family\r\n is quite well. It seems to me a thousand years until thy return,\r\n and I hear no rumour of it; I do not know how long thy absence will\r\n last, which is a grief to me. I say no more at present. May God guard\r\n thee.--In Florence on the 21st day June 1459.\r\n\r\n                                                    Mona Contessina.[71]\r\n\r\n\r\nCosimo de’ Medici _to his son_ Giovanni _at the Baths of Petriolo_\r\n\r\n The men who brought back the horses gave us thy letters, and told us\r\n of thy safe arrival, thanks be to God. We have heard nothing from thee\r\n since, nor how the baths agree with thee; we should be glad to have\r\n news often from thee to say how thou art, so do not omit to cause some\r\n one to write often. Here by the grace of God we are all very well and\r\n are preparing a fine feast at Careggi for the day of S. Cosimo. In\r\n three days we expect Guglielmo de’ Pazzi,[72] for Lorenzo has gone\r\n with his tutor to Cafaggiuolo, where he was expected. Be diligent in\r\n doing all that is necessary, and come back as soon as thou canst.\r\n Be not remiss in what thou art there for, and be careful to take\r\n thy baths properly, so that they may be beneficial. Christ guard\r\n thee.--Careggi, September 1459.\r\n\r\n                                                  Cosimo de’ Medici.[73]\r\n\r\n\r\nContessina de’ Medici _to her son_ Giovanni _and his_ _wife_ Ginevra\r\n_at Bagno a Morba_\r\n\r\n Dearest Children,--We have received your letters, which have given us\r\n great pleasure and relief, seeing that thou art better and that the\r\n improvement continues; may it please God that it shall continue, in\r\n order to give these two old people joy and consolation whilst they\r\n still live. It has been reported to thee that Cosimo and Piero have\r\n been ill; this annoys me, for I did not wish anything to sadden thee,\r\n so that the baths might have their proper effect. Their illness was\r\n but slight. Cosimo had a cold, which was soon cured, and he is now\r\n well; Piero had some pain, which is not yet gone; but you both know\r\n what always happens, so he will soon be well also. Cosimo has put an\r\n end to the worry of being one of the Eight, and Pier Francesco has\r\n been named in his stead: this might also be done for thee. I should be\r\n glad, Ginevra, to hear from thee how the baths act and how Mona Nanna\r\n serves thee. If I can do aught for thee here, tell me. Mona Pippa has\r\n the ailment thou knowest of, the others of thy party are well.--At\r\n Careggi on the 28th day of August 1460.\r\n\r\n                                                     Thy Contessina.[74]\r\n\r\nThe last few years of Cosimo’s life were clouded by ill-health and\r\nsuffering, and the knowledge that the growing arrogance and rapacity\r\nof his party, the Palleschi, were to a great extent alienating the\r\naffection and the esteem of the citizens from his house. Then the death\r\nin 1461 of Cosimino, the only child of Giovanni and Ginevra de’ Medici,\r\nwas a bitter grief to his grandparents, whose especial pet the little\r\nboy had been. Two years later Giovanni himself died, and the old man\r\nsadly exclaimed that the palace in Via Larga was now far too large for\r\nso small a family. He had always counted on the help Giovanni would\r\ngive to his elder brother Piero, who was crippled with gout, and his\r\ndeath at the early age of forty-six was a blow from which Cosimo never\r\nrallied.\r\n\r\n\r\nPope Pius II. _to_ Cosimo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Beloved Son,--Peace and apostolic blessing. The news we have just\r\n received of the death of your son, Giovanni of blessed memory, has\r\n grieved us deeply, not only because it is in itself untimely, but\r\n also because we fear it is likely to prove hurtful to a man of your\r\n age and infirmity. Yours is a life that should be prolonged in the\r\n sweetness of the Spirit, and you ought at all times to find comfort.\r\n Our own consolation is that you are wise, that you are well versed in\r\n the chances of fortune and able to hold your feelings in restraint. We\r\n urge you then, Cosimo, to do this, and looking towards God, to bless\r\n Him and to trust that all is for the best. We are ignorant of His\r\n secrets; He alone knows our needs and our true advantage. Let us then\r\n have faith that we and your son have been dealt with in gentleness,\r\n for neither you nor he could foresee the future. We look to your lofty\r\n nature, my son, to continue bearing God’s will in this with patience,\r\n even as we hear you do bear it, without giving way to grief. Mourning\r\n accords not with your age; it is contrary to your health, and we\r\n ourselves, your native city, and all Italy, require that your life\r\n should be as far as possible prolonged. Let good works and acts of\r\n piety be your tribute to your son’s memory. Anything else would be\r\n inconsistent with your nature; deeds of charity, devotion, and prayer\r\n are their own reward. This brief letter is written to acquaint you\r\n with our grief, and to assure you of our solicitude. Let these few\r\n words be counted for our affection.--Given at S. Peter’s, in Rome,\r\n under the ring of the Fisherman, on the 1st day of November 1463, in\r\n the 6th year of our pontificate.[75]\r\n\r\n\r\nCosimo de’ Medici _to_ Pope Pius II.\r\n\r\n Most blessed Father,--The power and wisdom of the words you wrote made\r\n me feel, while I read them, that I was veritably listening to the\r\n consoling voice of Him whose true Vicar you are. Nothing more sweet,\r\n nothing more saintly, or even divine, could have been written. And\r\n your consolation had this effect: I have always thought it expedient\r\n and praiseworthy to control (for I could not quench) my grief; but\r\n now, most blessed Father, to act contrary to your advice would seem\r\n to me positively sinful. I therefore strive to the best of my power,\r\n and so far as my weak spirit will permit, to bear this great calamity\r\n with calmness. To me it appeared a calamity; but God alone knows what\r\n is truly a misfortune, and we, as you write so wisely and devoutly,\r\n are ignorant of it. Yet I never thought it was not well with my son\r\n Giovanni, for I remembered that he had gone forth, not from life, but\r\n into life from death. For this, which we call life, is death, and\r\n that is the true life which is everlasting. And I recognised that the\r\n only suffering his death brought with it was ours, who truly must\r\n needs miss him. Yet we know not for what to pray. I trust that God\r\n in the abundance of His mercy will pity us that are left behind; for\r\n the Lord is gentle and full of mercy. But for my own life, I count\r\n it happy, because the Supreme Pontiff, the Vicar of Christ, has been\r\n thoughtful on its account. I will indeed take care of it; but not for\r\n the reasons which you, in your more than human kindness, have put\r\n forward. For what is my power now worth? What worth has it ever had?\r\n Nay, my purpose in caring for my life is that I may be found not to\r\n have despised this precious gift of God, nor to have forgotten the\r\n mercies which I have received from the divine love. I ask of you, most\r\n blessed Father, that your Holiness offer a prayer for me, your son, to\r\n God, that I may have strength to achieve this.--[1463].[76]\r\n\r\nOn 3rd November 1463 Pius II. wrote again to Cosimo, to ask him to\r\ninduce Florence to aid him, by equipping two galleys for his projected\r\ncrusade against the Turks. Cosimo’s answer is most respectful and very\r\nwary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCosimo de’ Medici _to_ Pius II.\r\n\r\n Cosimo greets the Supreme Pontiff.\r\n\r\n Most blessed Father,--I received your Holiness’ letter a few days\r\n ago, a letter full of grandeur and dignity, whose wisdom, as no one\r\n can doubt, could have proceeded from none but your Holiness. Me, at\r\n any rate, it so affected that after reading it several times I became\r\n convinced that such speech was beyond the common use of men, and was\r\n indeed none other than what might seem to be written at the dictation\r\n of that truly divine Spirit which spoke in the saints of old. When\r\n you speak of the insecurity of man’s lot, who would not straightway\r\n be moved by the power of your eloquence to despise all that is human?\r\n And when you solemnly tell of our immortal life to come, can any be\r\n so dull and leaden that he would not feel exalted, as he reads, so as\r\n to gain a vision, even here, of the glory of his own immortality and\r\n be inspired by a wonderful longing to attain it? And your deeds are\r\n no less holy than your words. I say nothing of what you have achieved\r\n in the past, saintly though it is and worthy of sacred remembrance.\r\n But with regard to the enterprise which you are now preparing, is it\r\n possible, most blessed Father, to believe that you, who are Christ’s\r\n Vicar, are attempting it without the presence within you of Him whose\r\n representative you are? The task is one so novel and so marvellous,\r\n that without God’s impulse and support to your age and infirmity the\r\n undertaking would seem doomed to fail. That I suppose is the reason\r\n why some people regard it, as you say in your letter, with amazement\r\n and disapproval. But I ask you, most blessed Father, whether it is\r\n not indeed a matter for wonder that a man like you, whose years and\r\n feeble health make their own claim to a life of ease and repose,\r\n should embark on the exertions of travel and all the hardships of\r\n war. It is natural, then, that the well-wishers of the Christian\r\n Commonwealth, the friends of peace in Italy, and all who desire the\r\n true and righteous tranquillity of kingdoms and the permanence of\r\n the Christian sway, should behold these difficulties and dangers\r\n with dread. They look upon your virtue as a gift clearly sent by God\r\n for the healing of human ills; they love the Roman Church and care\r\n for the integrity and happiness of Christendom; and they regard your\r\n safety as their security for all these. It must needs be that they are\r\n alarmed by your undertaking such difficulties and your exposure to\r\n such dangers, seeing that they do not possess your wisdom nor are they\r\n supported by the divine breath which inspires you. But though they do\r\n not see that which is before the eyes of your greater wisdom, perhaps\r\n since they wish only for what may be best for you and most beneficial\r\n for your flock, they do not deserve so much blame for disapproving\r\n an enterprise which to their limited apprehension appears so great\r\n and so difficult. You, most blessed Father, whom God will guide to\r\n victory even as He has brought you thus far, will persevere in spite\r\n of it all. Nor will the faith of Peter whose seat you occupy fail you.\r\n The end of this undertaking, which you begin so splendidly, will be\r\n to the glory of God and the joy and felicity of all that are yours,\r\n even though its initial stage be difficult and laborious. Behold the\r\n faithful shepherd offers his life for his sheep.\r\n\r\n I now come to the summons which you address to me and the invitation\r\n to join you in this beneficent and glorious enterprise. There you\r\n write to me not as a private man who is satisfied with the mediocre\r\n dignity of a citizen, but as though I were a reigning prince, and your\r\n exhortation is so kind that I find myself unable to thank you as I\r\n would wish. For though all through my life God’s kindness and bounty\r\n has showered upon me much more of human goods than I ever deserved,\r\n whereof you most eloquently adduce examples, yet by the grace of Him\r\n who is the giver of all that is good, I have never been oblivious of\r\n my humble lot. You, however, most blessed Father, in your superhuman\r\n kindness write to me in terms of moderation and in the form of a\r\n request, whereas it would be your right to urge, nay to command.\r\n\r\n But the things you ask of me, most blessed Father, are not of the same\r\n nature; as to the first, to procure you a vote of assistance from our\r\n city, well you know how limited is the power of a private citizen in\r\n a free state under popular government. Nevertheless I am ready to\r\n exert my influence, such as it is, in this direction, and will do so\r\n to the best of my ability, even as I have done hitherto; I will try to\r\n arrange that your interests should be consulted, for your interests\r\n are ours and those of the common cause of all Christians. This city\r\n of ours has never yet remained behind in any glorious undertaking;\r\n but has often by her own choice taken upon herself enormous expenses,\r\n difficulties, and dangers, for the defence and dignity of the Roman\r\n Pontiff. Therefore I do not believe that she will now hold aloof when\r\n you summon her to take part in this enterprise which is pious and\r\n necessary and to the common interest of us all.\r\n\r\n Personally, from my own resources I can promise you something more\r\n definite; that is to say I promise you, not indeed to equip two\r\n galleys (which would be an undertaking for a prince not for a private\r\n man), but to assist you so far as the limitations of my resources\r\n permit. I am not the man to imagine that the gifts of fortune which\r\n I possess are the deserved rewards of my business forethought, or of\r\n any virtue on my part, or that I have gained them by my human work\r\n or my industry, no, I am convinced they are but the gifts of a most\r\n bountiful God. If God, who is Himself the giver of all good things,\r\n either now or at any other time claims any part of it back, I should\r\n deserve to be deemed most ungrateful and impious if I grudged to\r\n return what He gave ungrudgingly; but especially now, when such a\r\n reward is promised me, which he, who in truth can loose and bind, puts\r\n before me.\r\n\r\n Be bold therefore, most blessed Father, in the cause of Christendom,\r\n persevere with energy and confidence, and bring the matter to an end.\r\n Be convinced, since God inspires you, that opportune assistance will\r\n not be wanting. And at last, when you have scattered the barbarous\r\n foes of the Christian name, when your sheep are defended and their\r\n fold protected, not only will mankind ever remember to honour in you\r\n the father and the shepherd, but when in the end God recalls you to\r\n His heaven, whence you have now been sent down as His Vicar, you will\r\n live in unceasing heavenly joy, having as it were gloriously served\r\n your term of divine office.[77]\r\n\r\nLucrezia was as anxious about the physical well-being of her children\r\nas about their education. Some months before Cosimo died she was at\r\nPisa with Giuliano, who was ill, and she writes to her husband:\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici _to her husband_ Piero\r\n\r\n I write thee several letters on the same day so that should one go\r\n astray thou wilt have news of Giuliano as thou desirest, by any one\r\n going there. Yesterday I wrote that as he was better I did not think\r\n the change suggested by Messer Mariotti was necessary, and last night\r\n I told thee the fever had returned as usual. My last letter was\r\n written at seven. After that he did not rest so quietly as on other\r\n nights, and he seems to me more uneasy than he should be now that the\r\n fever has diminished. I wish thee to know every small change so that\r\n thou canst the better judge what Maestro Mariotto writes; and act, not\r\n according to my ideas, but as thou thinkest best after reading our\r\n reports. His pulse is good, all functions are natural. The fever has\r\n returned almost as strong as on the fourteenth day, and has lowered\r\n but little. He is not so lively during the day as I could wish, being\r\n weakened by the strength of the fever. The Maestro says this is caused\r\n by the nature of the phlegm which is in him. I wish thee to know this.\r\n\r\n But do not be anxious, for Giuliano is strong; he walks about the\r\n room, and, though pale, is of good complexion. I give thee all these\r\n details more for thy information than because Giuliano seems to me\r\n ill, or that the amelioration does not continue. I commend myself to\r\n thee.--The 24th November 1463 at the 16th hour.\r\n\r\n                                                   Thy Lucrezia at Pisa.\r\n\r\n At this moment Giuliano is awake, and the Maestro says he has never\r\n found him so free from fever, and that during convalescence people are\r\n always more uneasy. Dost thou understand?[78]\r\n\r\n\r\nCosimo de’ Medici _to his son_ Piero _at Pisa_\r\n\r\n Yesterday we received yours of the 19th, by which we see you are all\r\n well. This is most pleasing to us, also that the town is healthy and\r\n that you are taking good care of Giuliano who is well. Again we beg of\r\n you to see that he takes care of himself. We have also received the\r\n letters from Bruges and all my other letters which you had, all shall\r\n be answered.\r\n\r\n I note that you will write to Niccolò in a few days, when the farm\r\n of Piero da Gagliano will be taken over. The sooner this is done the\r\n better, as the creditors have begun to get restless, that is Giovanni\r\n Rucie ...[79] to whom I have notified that he is to stop proceedings,\r\n as he will be paid before the end of the month.\r\n\r\n The plague here has abated, and no one mentions it any longer. The\r\n cold weather with snow and ice in these last days has put an end to\r\n it, so for the present we are all well. Day by day you shall have\r\n news how things go. Yester evening it began to rain, and is much\r\n milder.\r\n\r\n By the grace of God Contessina and I are very well, and so are Bianca\r\n and Gugliemo and the little Contessina. They come to us often to\r\n keep us company. To-morrow morning we shall get a letter from the\r\n Signori here to the Consuls [of the Sea][80] at Pisa, in order that\r\n you may cut the wood for the galleys that are to be built. This is a\r\n favourable moon for felling trees.\r\n\r\n Ruberto is dangerously ill, there is small hope of his recovery. God\r\n help him. For this reason none of his brothers can go to help about\r\n the wood for the galleys.\r\n\r\n Thy companions here will write and send their letters by a horseman\r\n and....[81] We do this so that you may have frequent news. Christ\r\n guard thee.--Florence, January 23, 1463 (1464).\r\n\r\n                                                  Cosimo de’ Medici.[82]\r\n\r\nThe following document shows that Francesco Sforza realised how much he\r\nowed to Cosimo de’ Medici. When on the death of Filippo Maria Visconti\r\nin 1447 Milan declared herself a Republic, popular feeling in Florence\r\nran high in her favour. It needed all Cosimo’s authority and influence\r\nto induce his fellow-citizens to assist Sforza in seizing supreme\r\npower. Cosimo saw that as a republic Milan would inevitably fall a prey\r\nto Venice, and thus the communications of Italy with the North would\r\nbe cut off. A strong ruler who owed his crown to Florence would be an\r\ninvaluable ally, and preserve the balance of power in Italy. We shall\r\nsee that Piero faithfully carried out his father’s policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancesco Sforza, _Duke of Milan_, _&c._ _&c._\r\n\r\n As we have always felt a particular affection for the magnificent\r\n Cosimo de’ Medici of Florence on account of his singular virtues, and\r\n as he also has loved us and all that pertains to us, we are bound and\r\n obliged to love all that belongs to him. Now here in Milan Pigello\r\n Portinaro, a Florentine citizen and merchant, the administrator and\r\n partner in the business and bank of the Magnificent Cosimo de’ Medici\r\n and of Piero and Johanni his sons in Milan, who has served us and the\r\n illustrious Madonna Bianca our consort ever since he came to inhabit\r\n this our city, about eleven years ago, with very large sums of money,\r\n with stuffs and with jewels, and with loans of divers kinds as appear\r\n by the entries in our private books. These services, subsidies, and\r\n favours given by the said Pigello according to the orders of the\r\n aforesaid Magnificent Cosimo and his sons were most pleasing and\r\n acceptable to us because they were given willingly, and the said\r\n Pigello carried them out and fulfilled them with great diligence,\r\n loyalty, and love towards us, and with admirable discretion, by which\r\n means we were enabled to arrange our affairs. Pigello made every\r\n effort to do this with the smallest possible loss to us, and we are\r\n sure he will continue to do so. Therefore we are much pleased and\r\n have been well served by the aforesaid Pigello; and all the profit,\r\n lucre, and gain that the said Pigello has made, either in their name\r\n or in his own with us and with our stewards, officials, and any other\r\n agents of ours, we for the above-named reasons approve of and are well\r\n content. By this our letter we declare that they can have and hold all\r\n without fear of contradiction or qualms of conscience, releasing and\r\n absolving the said Magnificent Cosimo, his sons and the said Pigello,\r\n and their sons and heirs in perpetuity from any claims; promising\r\n for ourselves, our sons and successors, that no question shall be\r\n raised about any profits or gains they may have made with us up to\r\n the present day for the above said reasons, or for any depending or\r\n arising therefrom. Because as has been said we have already, and by\r\n this our letter we do now make a general donation of the aforesaid\r\n privileges which is formal and binding, and is to be understood as\r\n including all those clauses and formalities which are necessary in a\r\n full and valid donation _de jure_; with the reservation that if any\r\n error is discovered in the books, writing, or reasons above said, they\r\n are to be corrected and amended in honest and just fashion; and this\r\n is to be understood as binding upon both parties. We command all our\r\n governors, clerks of the exchequer, and all other our officials and\r\n subjects who see the present letter, to observe it implicitly without\r\n contradiction or exception. And that all who see this letter may know\r\n that it is written by our own orders, we have signed it with our own\r\n hand, and had it sealed with the seal we always use.--Given in Milan\r\n on the 11th day of March 1463 (1464).\r\n\r\n                                        Francischus Sfortia,\r\n                                        _Vicecomis_, &c., _manu propria.\r\n                                        Cicchus._[83]\r\n\r\nThe last months of Cosimo’s life were passed chiefly at Careggi, and\r\nhis great solace was in study, as the following letter shows:\r\n\r\n\r\nCosimo de’ Medici _to the_ Reverend Master Marsilio Ficino, _Platonist_\r\n\r\n Yesterday I came to the villa of Careggi, not to cultivate my fields\r\n but my soul. Come to us, Marsilio, as soon as possible. Bring with\r\n thee our Plato’s book _De Summo Bono_. This, I suppose, you have\r\n already translated from the Greek language into Latin as you promised.\r\n I desire nothing so much as to know the best road to happiness.\r\n Farewell, and do not come without the Orphean lyre.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty days before his death, whilst talking to Ficino, Cosimo\r\nbewailed the unhappy lot of humanity and exulted in the happier\r\nprospect he felt was opening out before him. Ficino replied by citing\r\ncorresponding ideas from Greek authors, particularly from Zenocrates,\r\nupon which Cosimo demanded of Ficino, as a last service, to translate\r\nhis treatise on Death into Latin. The end was fast approaching, and\r\nCosimo’s calm, rather ironical nature was not changed by physical\r\nsuffering or by the fear of death. When his wife asked him why he\r\nremained silent for so many hours at a time, he answered: “When we go\r\nto the villa the preparations for our departure occupy thee for fifteen\r\ndays; dost thou not understand that I, who am leaving this life for the\r\nnext one, have much to think on?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few days before Cosimo died Piero wrote to his two sons Lorenzo and\r\nGiuliano at Cafaggiuolo, where they had been sent with their mother,\r\nLucrezia, on account of the plague which had broken out in Florence.\r\nIndeed there was a report that Cosimo’s malady was the plague, and many\r\nwere afraid to visit him.\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici _to_ Lorenzo _and_ Giuliano _his sons at Cafaggiuolo_\r\n\r\n I wrote to you the day before yesterday how much worse Cosimo was.\r\n It appears to me that he is gradually sinking, and he thinks so\r\n himself. On Tuesday evening he would have no one in his room save Mona\r\n Contessina and myself. He began to recount all his past life, then he\r\n touched upon the government of the city and then on its commerce, and\r\n at last he spoke of the management of the private possessions of our\r\n family and of what concerns you two; taking comfort that you had good\r\n wits and bidding me educate you well so that you might be of help to\r\n me. Two things he deplored. First, that he had not done as much as he\r\n wished or could have accomplished; secondly, that he left me in such\r\n poor health and with much irksome business. Then he said he would make\r\n no will, not having made one whilst Giovanni was alive, seeing that\r\n we were always united in true love, amity, and esteem, and when it\r\n pleased God to so order it he desired to be buried without pomp or\r\n show, and reminded me of his often expressed desire to be buried in S.\r\n Lorenzo. All this he said with much method and prudence, and with a\r\n courage that was marvellous to behold, adding that his life had been\r\n a long one and that he was ready and content to depart whensoever it\r\n pleased God. Yester morn he left his bed and caused himself to be\r\n carefully dressed. The Priors of S. Marco, of S. Lorenzo, and of the\r\n Badia of Fiesole were present. He made his confession to the Prior of\r\n S. Lorenzo and then heard mass, and he spoke the responses as though\r\n in perfect health. Then being asked the articles of faith he repeated\r\n them word by word and made his confession and took the Holy Sacrament\r\n with more devotion than can be described, having first asked pardon of\r\n all present. These things have raised my courage and my hope in the\r\n Almighty, although according to the flesh I am sorrowful, yet seeing\r\n the greatness of his soul and how well disposed he is, I am in part\r\n content that his end should be thus. Yesterday he was pretty well, and\r\n also during the night, but on account of his great age I have small\r\n hope of his recovery. Cause prayers to be said for him by the friars\r\n of Il Bosco[84] and bestow alms as seems best to you, praying God to\r\n leave him with us for a while, if such be for the best. And you, who\r\n are young, take example and assume your share of care and trouble as\r\n God has ordained, and being boys, make up your minds to be men; your\r\n condition and the present case demanding that of you lads. Above all\r\n take heed to everything that can add to your honour and be of use to\r\n you, because the time has come when it is necessary that you should\r\n rely on yourselves. Live in the fear of God and trust that all will\r\n go well. Of what befalls Cosimo I will advise you. We are expecting a\r\n doctor from Milan, but I have more hope in Almighty God than in aught\r\n else. No more at present.--Careggi, the 26th July 1464.[85]\r\n\r\nThe following letter is undated, but as it refers chiefly to the\r\ncharacter of Cosimo de’ Medici, and to a certain extent describes him,\r\nI have inserted it here.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarsilio Ficino _to the noble_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Even as harmony delights us more at the moment it strikes our ears\r\n than when we remember tunes we have heard, and the actual sight of war\r\n moves us more than any recital thereof, thus the great deeds of noble\r\n and illustrious men animate our courage far more than the words of\r\n orators and philosophers who dispute about valour. For it is ordered\r\n by nature that things themselves should be more potent than their\r\n names, and that real events should move the soul with greater force\r\n than what is either false or may have happened. Therefore by imitating\r\n the deeds of Socrates we are taught better how to attain courage\r\n than by the art displayed by Aristotle in his writings on morality.\r\n And Christ solely by His example has done more to make us adopt a\r\n holy and virtuous way of life than all the orators and philosophers\r\n that ever existed. Therefore, my Lorenzo, whilst I applaud you for\r\n not despising the writings which teach morals, I beg you to prefer\r\n learning from reality instead of from description, as you would\r\n prefer a living thing from a dead. Particularly as you have decided\r\n to emulate that aged man on whom our Senate bestowed the title of\r\n Father of His Country. I mean the great Cosimo, your grandfather and\r\n my lord. A man prudent above all men, pious towards God, just and most\r\n charitable towards men, temperate in living, diligent in his care for\r\n his family, and still more so in the affairs of the Republic; a most\r\n honourable man who lived not only for himself, but for the good of\r\n his country and his God; whose soul was as humble as any man’s, and\r\n yet great and exalted. I, my Lorenzo, for more than twelve years gave\r\n myself up to philosophy with him. He was as acute in reasoning as he\r\n was prudent and strong in governing. Certainly I owe much to Plato,\r\n but must confess that I owe no less to Cosimo. Inasmuch as Plato only\r\n once showed me the Idea of courage, Cosimo showed it me every day.\r\n For the moment I will not mention his other qualities. Cosimo was\r\n as avaricious and careful of time as Midas of money; he spent his\r\n days parsimoniously, carefully counting every hour and avariciously\r\n saving every second; he often lamented the loss of hours. Finally,\r\n having like Solon the philosophor (even when occupied in most serious\r\n business) diligently studied philosophy, yet even till the last day\r\n when he departed from this world of shadows to go to light he devoted\r\n himself to the acquisition of knowledge. For when we had read together\r\n Plato’s book dealing with the _Origin of the Universe_ and the _Summum\r\n Bonum_ he, as you who were present well know, soon after quitted this\r\n life as though he was really going to enjoy that happiness which he\r\n had tasted during our conversations. Farewell, and as God fashioned\r\n Cosimo according to the Idea of the world, do you continue as you have\r\n begun to fashion yourself according to the Idea of Cosimo.\r\n\r\n                                                    Marsilio Ficino.[86]\r\n\r\n\r\nBrief Memorandum by Piero de’ Medici about his Father’s Death\r\n\r\n I record that on the 1st August 1464, at the hour of 22-1/2, Cosimo di\r\n Giovanni de’ Medici quitted this life, having been a great sufferer\r\n from pains in his joints, although free from all other ills. Towards\r\n the end of his life he was afflicted with suppression of urine, which\r\n caused frequent fever. He was seventy-seven years of age, a tall,\r\n handsome man, and healthy, save for the above-mentioned ills. Of great\r\n prudence and still greater kindness, he was the most eminent and\r\n the richest citizen our city had possessed for many years, and was\r\n trusted and loved by the people above all other men. Indeed there is\r\n no record of any citizen who died at that age who was so kind and so\r\n famous, and was so universally mourned and with reason, for no man\r\n ever had to complain of him, but many have been helped, and succoured,\r\n and assisted, for his greatest pleasure lay in aiding others; not\r\n only relations and friends, but strangers; and what is more difficult\r\n to believe, and still more difficult to accomplish, those who were\r\n unfriendly. By such praiseworthy actions he made many persons his\r\n friends, who by their own fault or the fault of others had been his\r\n enemies. He was liberal, charitable, and merciful, and gave many\r\n alms during his life, not only in the city and the State, but in far\r\n distant places for things pertaining to religion, rebuilding churches,\r\n and giving for other worthy objects which had come under his notice.\r\n He was highly esteemed and believed in by all the lords and princes in\r\n and out of Italy. He filled all the greatest positions in our city,\r\n all foreign ones he declined; but he joined in the most important and\r\n honourable embassies sent by our Republic in his time. In the city\r\n his commerce enriched many men, besides procuring a large fortune to\r\n himself. He was not only a wise and cautious man of business, but a\r\n lucky one. As has been said, he died on the aforesaid day in our house\r\n at Careggi, after receiving all the sacraments of Holy Church with\r\n the utmost devotion and reverence. He would not make a will, but left\r\n everything in my hands. He was buried in the church of S. Lorenzo in\r\n the earth, in the sepulchre ordered by him, without any honours or\r\n pomp, as he would have none but the canons and priests of the said\r\n church, the friars of S. Marco, and the canons regular of the Badia of\r\n Fiesole, and neither more nor less wax torches than were used at an\r\n ordinary funeral. This he ordered with his last breath; saying that\r\n alms-giving and other good works ought to be performed while alive,\r\n as he had done, and were then of more use. Notwithstanding I, wishing\r\n to pay my filial debt to paternal piety, did what was requisite on\r\n account of those who remained, ordering alms and masses, as follows\r\n in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Note of the Funeral and of the Masses that are to be said in the\r\n Church of S. Lorenzo and in other places for the Soul of Cosimo di\r\n Giovanni de’ Medici, &c._\r\n\r\n On the morning of August 2, which was Thursday, the funeral took place\r\n in the church of S. Lorenzo; for wax we paid lire 43-1/2; for torches,\r\n 94 lbs. of candles for putting in the church, and 13 small torches to\r\n be carried by the priests, in all 190-1/2 lbs., and for 16 torches of\r\n 97 lbs. for placing round the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Note of the Masses and Offices celebrated for the Soul of Cosimo_\r\n\r\n To the Chapter and priests of S. Lorenzo for an office lasting eight\r\n consecutive days, beginning on August 3rd; with 30 masses for each\r\n office, which make 8 offices, with 240 masses for the octave, we paid\r\n 16 lire for 6 torches of 33 lbs. and 10 lbs. of candles.\r\n\r\n To the Chapter and priests of S. Lorenzo for an office beginning on\r\n August 11th, and continuing for thirty consecutive days, finishing on\r\n the 11th September, we paid 60 lire per torch of wax of 170 lbs.\r\n\r\nThen follows a long list of members of the family, friends, dependants,\r\nand slaves, each of whom had from 30 to 10 braccia each of black cloth\r\nfor the funeral; the women of the family had also black veils and\r\nkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nBesides the many offices celebrated in Florence for the soul of Cosimo,\r\nthe various Companies of Rome, Venice, Milan, Bruges, Geneva, London,\r\nand Avignon celebrated a great many; and liberal alms were given, and\r\nmany prisoners were pardoned and set free from divers prisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum of all the Men to whom was given Mourning for the said\r\nFuneral_\r\n\r\n                                                             Yds.

His family, as has\r\nbeen said, respected his wish that he should be buried as a private\r\ncitizen, without any public and official pomp. His fellow-citizens\r\nnevertheless resolved to commemorate in some special fashion the\r\ndecease of the real head of their State. A minute setting forth his\r\nservices was incorporated in the _Acta_ of the Ten, who also passed a\r\nlaw declaring that he was to be afterwards known by the title of _Pater\r\nPatriæ_, and appointed Donato Acciaiuoli to commend its adoption to the\r\npeople in a set oration. The law was adopted by acclamation, and Cosimo\r\nis always known as Cosimo Pater Patriæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] _Le Istorie Fiorentine_, Niccolò Machiavelli, p. 240.

He was a martyr\r\nto gout, from whence his surname _il Gottoso_. Kindly and indolent\r\nby nature, he could be stern, terse, and eloquent when roused, and\r\nhis political insight was keen. The commencement of his reign, if\r\none may use the word, was unfortunate. Cosimo on his deathbed had\r\nrecommended his son to consult Diotisalvi Neroni, and to follow his\r\nadvice. The shrewd old man had been singularly deceived in his estimate\r\nof the character of the man he bade Piero take as his right hand.\r\nMachiavelli’s account of the conspiracy which so nearly wrecked the\r\npower of the house of Medici is as follows:\r\n\r\n“Messer Diotisalvi, moved more by his own ambition than by affection\r\nfor Piero or gratitude for the benefits he had received from Cosimo,\r\nthought it would be easy to ruin Piero’s credit, and to deprive him of\r\nthe authority inherited from his father. He therefore gave him advice\r\nwhich appeared most honest and reasonable, but in reality was meant\r\nto lead to his ruin. Showing him the disorder in his affairs, and how\r\nmuch money was absolutely necessary to save his own credit and that\r\nof the State, he declared that the most honourable way to remedy his\r\ndifficulties would be to call in the debts due to his father by both\r\nforeigners and citizens. For Cosimo, in order to gain partisans in\r\nFlorence and friends abroad, had been most generous in the use of his\r\nriches, and the moneys owing to him amounted to a very considerable\r\nsum. Such counsel seemed good and honest to Piero, who wished to remedy\r\nhis affairs with his own means. But as soon as he demanded repayment\r\nof these loans the citizens, as though he wanted to take what was\r\ntheirs and not what was his own, complained loudly, and showed\r\nsmall respect in speaking ill of him, and accusing him of ingratitude\r\nand avarice. When Messer Diotisalvi saw the universal disfavour his\r\nadvice had brought on Piero he joined Messer Luca Pitti, Messer Agnolo\r\nAcciaiuoli, and Niccolò Soderini, and they conspired to deprive Piero\r\nof his credit and his authority. They were influenced by various\r\nmotives. Messer Luca aspired to fill the position held by Cosimo,\r\nhaving become so great a man that he disdained to obey Piero. Messer\r\nDiotisalvi, knowing that Messer Luca was unfit to be the head of the\r\ngovernment, thought that once Piero was out of the way the management\r\nmust of necessity fall to him. Niccolò Soderini desired that the city\r\nshould enjoy more freedom, and be governed according to the wishes of\r\nthe magistrates, while Messer Agnolo had private reasons for hating the\r\nMedici. Some time before his son Raffaello had married Alessandra de’\r\nBardi, whose dower was very large. Owing either to her own misconduct,\r\nor to the faults of others, she was maltreated by her father-in-law and\r\nher husband; so one night Lorenzo d’Ilarione, her kinsman, moved to\r\npity for the girl, with many men-at-arms, took her away from the house\r\nof Messer Agnolo. The Acciaiuoli complained of the insult done to them\r\nby the Bardi, and the matter being laid before Cosimo he decreed that\r\nthe dower was to be repaid to Alessandra, and that she was to decide\r\nwhether she would or would not return to her husband. Messer Agnolo\r\ndid not think that in delivering this judgment Cosimo had behaved as\r\na friend, and not being able to do anything against him he determined\r\nto take revenge on his son. The conspirators, though animated by such\r\ndiverse motives, agreed to give the same reason publicly, declaring\r\nthat they desired the city to be ruled by magistrates and not by the\r\nuncontrolled will of a few men. The hatred felt against Piero and the\r\nreasons for attacking him, were increased by the bankruptcy of many\r\nmerchants for which he was blamed; his unexpected demand to be repaid\r\nhaving caused these men to fail, and thus brought great discredit and\r\nloss upon the city.”[87]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                                              _Anderson_\r\n\r\nPIERO DI COSIMO DE’ MEDICI.\r\n\r\n_Detail from the fresco by Benozzo Gozzoli in the Chapel of Palazzo\r\nRiccardi, Florence._]\r\n\r\nFlorence was divided into two camps, the Party of the Hill, so-called\r\nbecause Luca Pitti’s palace was being erected on the highest part of\r\nthe city, and the Party of the Plain, because the palace of the Medici\r\nwas on the flat. “While things were in this disorder,” continues\r\nMachiavelli, “the time arrived for renewing the chief magistrate, and\r\nNiccolò Soderini was elected Gonfalonier of Justice.” But Niccolò\r\nwasted his two months’ tenure of office in futile attempts to “reform”\r\nthe government, accomplished nothing, and quitted office a discredited\r\nman. The conspirators then determined to murder Piero as he returned to\r\nFlorence from his villa of Careggi. He was only saved by the presence\r\nof mind of his young son Lorenzo, who preceded him on horseback,\r\nand noticed armed men loitering on the road. Lorenzo rode quietly\r\non announcing that Piero was close behind him, but sent back in hot\r\nhaste a messenger to order his father’s litter to take an unfrequented\r\nlane. Luca Pitti, perceiving that if the Medici were swept away\r\nNeroni and not himself would be the head of the Republic, betrayed\r\nhis fellow-conspirators, and made peace with Piero. His defection was\r\na death-blow to the conspiracy and to his own fortunes. Neroni and\r\nNiccolò Soderini fled to Venice, Acciaiuoli to Siena first and then to\r\nNaples, and the power of the Medici was once more firmly established.\r\n\r\nPiero inherited his father’s love of letters and of art. He was the\r\nfirst to employ Luca della Robbia, who decorated the ceiling of his\r\nstudy in the Medici palace and made tiles for the floor, which, as\r\nVasari says, “was a new thing and most excellent for summer.” Luca also\r\nmade the vaulted roof of the marble chapel of the Crucifix inside the\r\nancient church of S. Miniato a Monte, erected by Piero’s orders by his\r\nfather’s faithful friend, Michelozzo Michelozzi.\r\n\r\nWhatever currents of opinion disturbed the city of Florence at the\r\ndeath of Cosimo de’ Medici, foreign powers universally recognised his\r\nson Piero as his successor in the rule of the Republic. The Pope sent\r\nhim a letter of condolence on his father’s death, while the King of\r\nFrance, Louis XI., testified his regard for the Medici by creating him\r\na Privy Councillor, and giving him the right to add the Lily of France\r\nto the arms of his family.\r\n\r\n\r\nPope Pius II. _to_ Piero de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Beloved Son,--Greeting and apostolic blessing. We have just heard that\r\n Cosimo, your father, has departed this life. This is indeed bitter\r\n and mournful news, and most grievous to us. For we loved him with\r\n sincere affection as a man whom we always found devoted to ourselves\r\n and to the Apostolic See, whom we knew to be gifted with unusual\r\n insight and kindness. Yet, my son, though many besides yourself will\r\n mourn his death, you must bear with a brave heart this fate which\r\n divine law has ordained for mortals. Accept this expression of God’s\r\n will patiently, and do not give way to grief. If you consider the\r\n course of human existence, Cosimo has had a long life; he has paid\r\n his debt to nature, and in his old age he has gone the way of all\r\n flesh. His life was full of honour; his glory extended beyond his\r\n own city to all Italy, nay, to the whole world; he has lived in the\r\n highest esteem and, what we must value more, in piety, and abiding in\r\n the fear of God. It is not right to mourn the death of a man who has\r\n lived righteously and justly, since we must believe that he has gone\r\n from this troubled human existence to one that is full of peace and\r\n tranquillity. As for us, beloved son, we intend to preserve towards\r\n you the feelings we had for your father, and for him we had a singular\r\n paternal affection. We promise that we shall always do what in our\r\n judgment will be conducive to your honour and your interest, and to\r\n that of the house of Medici. This we wish you to understand.--Given at\r\n Ancona under the seal of the Fisherman, the 8th day of August 1464, in\r\n the sixth year of our pontificate.[88]\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis XI., _King of France_, _to_ Piero de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Dilecto Filio Nobili Viro Petro de’ Medicis._ Louis, by the grace of\r\n God King of France.\r\n\r\n Most dear and great Friend,--We have received by our beloved and\r\n faithful courier Francesco Nori your letters which you sent to us\r\n by him. From him and from your letters we have learned how kindly\r\n you have acted in our favour towards our dear and beloved uncle the\r\n Duke of Milan about the affair of the Marches of which we wrote,\r\n and we are much pleased and very grateful to you. We also heard of\r\n the death of the late Cosimo de’ Medici, our great friend and your\r\n father, which has given and does give us much sorrow, both for the\r\n singular love we bore him and for the great and laudable services he\r\n rendered to us and to the French crown during his whole life. For the\r\n enduring memory thereof and of the friendship he showed to us and to\r\n the crown, and in order to honour him and you and all his relatives\r\n and family, and for the salvation of his soul, we beg you to dedicate\r\n to the service of your said dead father banners with our arms, of\r\n such number as seems best to you and is customary in such cases. We\r\n have also, in order to show the confidence we place in you, in your\r\n wisdom, loyalty, goodness, and diligence, and for the preservation of\r\n the friendship and goodwill which always existed between your late\r\n father and ourselves, appointed you one of our privy councillors, and\r\n have ordered the letters patent to be made out, which we send by the\r\n bearer; and when you desire anything for yourself, for your family or\r\n for your Commune, we shall grant it in your favour if you signify it\r\n and let us know by the said Franceschino, for whom we have always felt\r\n and feel singular affection and esteem.[89]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Privilege granted by Louis XI. to the Medici to quarter the Lily of\r\nFrance in their arms_\r\n\r\n Louis, by the grace of God King of France. We make known to all\r\n present and for the future: Bearing in mind the great, praiseworthy,\r\n and much to be commended fame enjoyed by the late Cosimo de’ Medici\r\n during his life in all his actions and his affairs, which he conducted\r\n with such great virtue and prudence that his children and other\r\n relatives and friends must be commended and held in high honour.\r\n For these reasons and moved by the supplication and prayer which has\r\n been addressed to us by our friends, and by our loyal Councillor\r\n Piero de’ Medici, son of the said late Cosimo de’ Medici, we by\r\n our own will, special grace, full power and royal authority decree\r\n and command by these presents that the said Piero de’ Medici ...\r\n his heirs and successors born and to be born in legal wedlock may\r\n henceforward and for ever have and bear in the arms three Fleur de\r\n lis of the shape and manner herein portrayed.... And these arms we\r\n have given and give to them by these said presents, to use as seems\r\n good to them in all places and among all people, in time of peace or\r\n in time of war, without any impediment either now or hereafter being\r\n placed to their so doing. And in order that this thing should be firm\r\n and stable for ever, we have caused our seal to be set to these two\r\n presents, reserving our rights in all other things and our authority\r\n in everything.--Given at Mont Luçon in the month of May, the year of\r\n grace 1465, and the fourth year of our reign.[90]\r\n\r\nOwing to Piero’s miserable health, his son Lorenzo was sent, even as\r\nquite a lad, to visit foreign courts and to receive foreign princes\r\nwho passed through Tuscany. Thus in April 1465 he met Don Federigo\r\nd’Aragona, second son of the King of Naples, at Pisa, on his way to\r\nMilan to escort his eldest brother’s bride, Ippolita Maria, daughter\r\nof Francesco Sforza, to Naples. The two youths formed a lasting\r\nfriendship, and on Federigo’s return with his sister-in-law they came\r\nto Florence and stayed in the Medici palace. Ippolita and Lorenzo then\r\nbecame such friends that she never hesitated to appeal to him when,\r\nas often happened in the needy Neapolitan court, she wanted money.\r\nThey often corresponded, and when Lorenzo went to Naples in 1479, the\r\nDuchess of Calabria and Don Federigo were his powerful allies. The\r\nfollowing letter, a remarkable one for a lad of seventeen, was sent\r\nto Don Federigo with a volume of poems selected from those writers\r\nLorenzo considered to be masters of the Tuscan tongue. There are two\r\ncopies in Florence, one in the Nazionale Library,[91] the other in the\r\nRiccardiana.[92]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Magnificent_ Lorenzo to the Illustrious Lord Federigo, _son of the\r\nKing of Naples_\r\n\r\n Often have I reflected, Illustrious my Lord Federigo, which among the\r\n many and infinite poems of antiquity is the most excellent. Certes,\r\n one must have been more admirable than the others. It has always\r\n been a matter of surprise to me that no great and fine work was\r\n originated in ancient times, either of hands or head, which did not\r\n receive private and public recognition and reward. So as all rivers\r\n and springs are said to have their origin from the great Ocean, all\r\n the famous deeds and marvellous works of bygone men may be said to\r\n derive from this laudable habit. The nutriment of every art is honour,\r\n and by the desire of glory alone are men’s minds spurred to produce\r\n admirable works. Thus in Rome we see magnificent triumphal entries,\r\n in Greece the famous Olympian games, and both are celebrated by poets\r\n and orators with infinite mastery. For this alone were the chariot\r\n and the triumphal arch, the highly decorated theatres, the statues,\r\n the palm branches, the garlands, the funereal honours; for this alone\r\n were devised other splendid ornaments, and thus were encouraged high\r\n and noble deeds of the intellect and of the sword, all the marvellous\r\n works of the great men of ancient days, who assuredly (as our Tuscan\r\n poet says) will never lack fame so long as this world lasts. These\r\n of a truth were great and divine men, desirous of enduring fame and\r\n supremely grateful to those who, by celebrating the valour and noble\r\n deeds of great men in fine poetry, made their names immortal. Inflamed\r\n by such desire, Alexander the Great on seeing the tomb of the famous\r\n Achilles with a sigh uttered those memorable words: “Fortunate art\r\n thou to have so glorious a sepulchre and to have been sung by such a\r\n pen.” Fortunate indeed. For without the divine poet Homer Achilles’\r\n body and fame would have been buried in one tomb together. And even\r\n this poet, excellent above all others, would not have attained such\r\n honour and glory had he not been so admired by a learned Athenian,\r\n almost one may say raised from death to life. For after his death\r\n the great poet’s noble work was scattered and dismembered until\r\n Pisistratus, prince of Athens, a man endowed with many virtues and\r\n of noble presence, offered large rewards to whosoever brought him\r\n verses by Homer. Thus with great diligence and care he collected\r\n and reconstructed the glorious poem, giving to it eternal life and\r\n to himself everlasting glory. For this reason the only epitaph on\r\n his statue is the record that he collected the poems of the great\r\n Homer. Oh, truly divine men, born for the good of humanity and of\r\n the world. The prince knew that his other deeds, however admirable,\r\n were as nothing compared with this one poem. Such were these antique\r\n men, whose deeds are not to be equalled in later times, and indeed\r\n are hardly believed. For as rewards for noble deeds no longer exist\r\n the flame of courage is extinguished; and as men do nothing worthy of\r\n praise the singers of great deeds are despised. If this had not been\r\n the case we should not now mourn the loss of so many Greek and Latin\r\n writers. With them have also perished many of our own old poets, who\r\n had begun to cultivate the desert fields of the Tuscan tongue, which\r\n now again, in our century, are covered with wild flowerets and weeds.\r\n But thy gracious hand, Illustrious Federigo, which thou hast deigned\r\n extend to them will, after their long struggle, lead them safely into\r\n port.\r\n\r\n When we were together last year in the ancient city of Pisa we spoke\r\n of those who had written poetry in the Tuscan tongue, and thy Lordship\r\n expressed a desire that I should collect their works in one volume for\r\n thee. Being desirous in this, as in all other matters, to fulfil thy\r\n wishes I have, not without great labour, caused search to be made for\r\n the works of all the old poets, and choosing the less rugged pieces\r\n have gathered them into the volume I now send thy Lordship, in the\r\n hopes that my efforts, such as they are, may please and that thou wilt\r\n accept it in memory of me and as a proof of my true affection. Let\r\n no one, however, despise this Tuscan tongue as unadorned or diffuse.\r\n For if its richness and beauty be rightly understood it will not be\r\n accounted rugged but rich and refined. There is nothing delicate,\r\n elegant, graceful, or ornate, nothing witty, ingenious or subtle,\r\n nothing ample and rich, nothing magnificent and sonorous, finally\r\n nothing ardent, bold, or moving, that is not found in those two\r\n magnates Dante and Petrarch, and even in others of whom thou, my Lord,\r\n didst cite brilliant examples. Poetry (according to what Petrarch\r\n writes in a Latin epistle) was held in high honour by the old Romans,\r\n and after long neglect appeared again in Sicily not so many centuries\r\n ago; then passing into France finally came to Italy as though to its\r\n own home. The first who courted the new style was Guittone of Arezzo,\r\n and about the same time the famous Bolognese, Guido Guizzinello. Both\r\n were learned in philosophy, serious, and sententious. The first rather\r\n harsh and severe and without the gift of eloquence, the second far\r\n more lucid, suave, and ornate, so that our honoured Dante did not\r\n scruple to call him his father and also father of others who wrote\r\n love songs of great sweetness and charm. He was certainly the first to\r\n colour and soften our language, which had only been roughly sketched\r\n out by the rude Aretine. After them emerged the elegant Florentine,\r\n Guido Cavalcanti, a subtle logician and philosopher, an honour to\r\n his age. As he was handsome and graceful in person and of most noble\r\n blood, so there was in his writings something, I know not what, more\r\n beautiful, noble, and rare, than in others. Acute in reasoning,\r\n sonorous, admirable, and grave in his sentences, rich and elevated\r\n in composition, wise and prudent; and all these gifts are enhanced,\r\n and as clothed in a precious garment, by a rare and exquisite style.\r\n Had he used this on a wider field no doubt he would have attained to\r\n the highest honours. One of his most admirable works is a song in\r\n which this subtle and charming poet describes every quality, virtue,\r\n and precedent of love. This was held in such high estimation that it\r\n was commentated by three renowned philosophers, his contemporaries,\r\n among them the Roman Egidio. We must not forget Bonagiunta of Lucca\r\n and the notary of Lentino, both grave and sententious writers, but\r\n so devoid of charm that they may be proud to be mentioned in the\r\n company of these honoured men. They, and Pier delle Vigne in the\r\n time of Guittone, were celebrated. The little written by the latter\r\n is not without solemnity and erudition. He was the keeper (as Dante\r\n says) of the keys of Frederick’s heart, and locked and unlocked it\r\n at his pleasure. After these shone those two great men who illumined\r\n our tongue, Dante and Petrarch. Of them (as Sallust says of Carthage)\r\n I think it better to say nothing than to say too little. Onesto the\r\n Bolognese and the earlier Silicians who flourished before them and\r\n were therefore less versed in their art, did not lack talent or\r\n ambition. Cino da Pistoja, in my estimation, well deserves his high\r\n reputation; tender and loving, he was the first to entirely shake off\r\n the antique ruggedness of which the divine Dante was not altogether\r\n free. Then comes a long line of more modern writers who are far behind\r\n those two great ones. All these, and with them some of our own time,\r\n come to thank thee, who art more worthy of praise than that ancient\r\n Athenian already mentioned. He only gave immortality to one, whilst\r\n thou givest it to many. At the end of the volume (as seemed to be\r\n thy desire) we have copied a few of our own sonnets and songs, so\r\n that when reading them thou canst remember my loyalty and affection.\r\n Although not worthy to be placed among the splendid works of the old\r\n poets, yet they may serve as a foil to show their greater beauty.\r\n Receive, therefore, Illustrious Lord, this volume and myself, not only\r\n in thy house, but in thy heart and soul, as thou hast a blithe and\r\n enduring abode in ours.\r\n\r\nIn the commentary Lorenzo wrote on some of his sonnets he not only, as\r\nin the above letter, praises Italian, but affirms its equality with the\r\nclassic languages, and declares that neither Ovid, Tibullus, Catullus,\r\nor Propertius wrote love songs of such beauty and grace as Petrarch.\r\nIt was by this enthusiastic participation in the intellectual pursuits\r\nand interests of his day that Lorenzo, even as a youth, attained such\r\npopularity with his fellow-citizens. They were proud of the lad who was\r\nalready known as a poet, who excelled in all bodily exercises, and who\r\nwas treated by foreign princes and potentates as an equal. The above\r\nletter to Federigo d’Aragona shows that he was, to quote John Addington\r\nSymonds: “A Florentine of the Florentines. Tuscan to the backbone,\r\nimbued with the spirit of his city, a passionate lover of her customs\r\nand pastimes, a complete master of her vernacular. His education,\r\nthough it fitted him for Platonic discussions with Ficino and rendered\r\nhim an amateur of humanistic culture, had failed to make a pedant of\r\nhim. Much as he appreciated the classics, he preferred his Tuscan\r\npoets; and what he learned at school he brought to bear upon the study\r\nof the native literature.”[93]\r\n\r\nSoon after his return from Pisa Lorenzo was despatched by his father\r\nto Bologna, Ferrara, Venice, and Milan. Piero calls the journey\r\n“the touchstone of thy abilities.” The letters show that the boy of\r\nseventeen was received as a prince, and discussed with the rulers of\r\nthe various states he visited important political matters, in all of\r\nwhich he was kept carefully informed by his father. At the same time,\r\nwith characteristic Medicean shrewdness, Lorenzo was instructed to\r\nplace himself in the hands of his father’s agents in each city visited,\r\nand the whole journey could be represented as a tour of inspection of\r\nthe various agencies of a great banking-house, and the introduction of\r\nthe heir to the business of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici _to his son_ Lorenzo _at Milan_\r\n\r\n Thou hast arrived at Milan later than I thought, and perhaps than\r\n thou didst wish, on account of the delay caused by the honours paid\r\n thee by the Duke at Ferrara. I have written to thank him, and to say\r\n we are his debtors, and also to Messer Giovanni Bentivoglio I have\r\n sent thanks, &c. Thou art to follow the advice of Pigello[94] and his\r\n written instructions; be careful not to worry the Duke, he will have\r\n enough of that with this marriage.[95] Thou art to consider thyself\r\n as the servant and as belonging to the household of his Excellency,\r\n and to ask Pigello’s advice as to what visits to pay, and what to\r\n say. Remember to be civil and alert; act as a man and not as a boy.\r\n Show sense, industry, and manly endeavour, so that thou mayst be\r\n employed in more important things, for this journey is the touchstone\r\n of thy abilities. I sent by carrier the rest of the silver [plate] to\r\n Pigello, but have not yet heard of its arrival. If thou needst aught\r\n else let me know, but Pigello will provide all that is necessary.\r\n Consult with him about inviting Don Federigo one day to the house\r\n there, or anything else thou thinkest needful. Arrange with him\r\n after due reflection, and whatever is settled do with splendour and\r\n in honourable fashion. Gugliemo,[96] thou, and Pigello can settle\r\n together, and whatever is decided will please me, only, as I said, do\r\n not stint money, but do thyself honour. When thou hast time, after\r\n having paid thy visits, commend me to the Duke and to Madonna, to\r\n Count Galeazzo and to whoso else thou thinkest right. Amuse thyself\r\n and do not worry about us here, the time will come soon enough when\r\n thou wilt have to do so. Nannina is well again; we will talk about her\r\n marriage after thy return from Naples. Gugliemo’s family are all well;\r\n tell him not to forget them entirely, and be not so taken up with all\r\n those festivities as to forget thyself. I think thou hast better leave\r\n there a few days before the others, because as I have Madonna the\r\n Princess here in our house, and Gugliemo and thyself being absent, I\r\n shall be as a man without hands, but of this I will write later. No\r\n more at present. Christ guard thee.--Florence, May 4, 1465.[97]\r\n\r\n Da Vinegia ho la tua de 2 dì et dovevi partire el dì seguente et così\r\n da Allessandro a dì 3 m’avisa essere seguito et quanto haveir seguito\r\n a Ferrara nel soprastare a complacentie di quel Signore et a Vinegia\r\n nel vicitare el doge et quelli altri gentiluomini che tucto lodo et\r\n commendo et cosὶ credo che harete facto la più parte delle vicitationi\r\n harj trovato una mia lettera scrittati a dì 4 e per quella dettoti\r\n come t’abbi a governare per questa el simile ti ricordo et per dire\r\n con una parola a te bisogna fare conto essere huomo et non garzone\r\n le parole e gesti et modi sieno circa quest’ effecto et bisognando\r\n convitare o fare alcuna altra cosa per farti honore non perdonare a\r\n spesa o cosa che facci di bisogno per ora non entrerò in altro Innanzi\r\n che parta di costì sarai avisato di quello che haraj a fare da poi\r\n la partita ma mi sono ristretto con questi cittadini et a ciascuno è\r\n paruto jo debba ricevere alla tornata questi S. qui in casa nostra\r\n et così m’a commandato la S. la quale ho ubbidito volentieri et era\r\n mestieri che tu o Gugliemo vi trovassi di qua che m’aresti levato\r\n assai noje pur si farà el melglio che si potrà Sarà necessario che\r\n vi partiate qualche giorno innanzi alla brigata di costà et a tempo\r\n ne sarete avisati.

Alessandro wrote on the 3rd and told me of thy\r\n departure, and of what thou didst at Ferrara to please the Duke,\r\n and of thy visits at Venice to the Doge and other gentlemen, all of\r\n which I approve and commend, and I think thou hast paid nearly all\r\n necessary visits.

For the present I say no more. Before leaving\r\n thou shalt hear what to do. I have consulted with the citizens here,\r\n and they all agree that I must receive the princes[99] in our house\r\n on their return, and the Signoria has commanded me to do so: I obey\r\n willingly, but it would have taken much trouble off my hands hadst\r\n thou and Gugliemo been here; however, we will do the best we can. It\r\n will be better for thee to leave a few days before the others, thou\r\n shalt be warned in time. I did not write to Venice because the delay\r\n at Ferrara threw out all arrangements, but it is of no consequence.\r\n All our family here are well, and we hope thou art the same and wilt\r\n return in safety. We are preparing great festivities for these princes\r\n on S. John’s day, and shall try and do them honour also in other\r\n ways.

No more at present.\r\n Christ guard thee.--In Florence on the 11th day of May 1465.\r\n\r\n Do not forget to commend me to the Magnificent Count Guasparre.\r\n\r\n                                                  Piero de’ Medici.[100]\r\n\r\nS. John’s Day (24th June) is still a great holiday in Florence. The\r\ncathedral and the baptistery are illuminated, and fireworks (the\r\nscaffoldings for which used to be erected on the Ponte della Carraja\r\nuntil the tramway took possession of the bridge) are now let off on\r\nthe Piazza Michelangelo. An old chronicler writes: “On the day of S.\r\nJohn, the patron saint of the city, and on the vigil thereof, not only\r\nare there infinite demonstrations of spiritual joy, but everything\r\nthat can be done in such a city is done to show temporal happiness and\r\ngaiety. Swift horses called _Barberi_ race in public for a _palio_, or\r\nbanner, of cloth of gold lined with precious fur. Merchants display\r\nuntold riches in gold, jewels, pearls, and money, and in cloth of gold,\r\nsilks, and woollen goods of incredible value. There are illuminations,\r\nbonfires, and fireworks, both public and private, and the whole city\r\nis given over to rejoicing. Among other diversions is jousting. This\r\nis a game played by men clothed in the richest damasks and costumes\r\nand varied liveries, according to the costumes and liveries of their\r\nfamilies, who place themselves in proper order in the field (having\r\nfirst triumphantly escorted an emperor in a gilded car, with a fine and\r\nnoble procession of kings, dukes, marquesses, counts, soldiers, and\r\nbaggage waggons), on splendidly caparisoned horses, well trained to\r\nrace. First they race in the public squares, and then in certain places\r\nset apart for breakneck exercises they break lances with no small\r\ndexterity.”\r\n\r\nOn that day also the Signori, surrounded by their attendants, and the\r\nsoldiers and trumpeters of the Commune, sat on the _ringhiera_[101] of\r\nthe Palazzo Vecchio, in their magnificent official costumes, which must\r\nhave been rather trying in hot summer weather. The Gonfalonier was clad\r\nin a long loose crimson velvet coat lined with ermine and embroidered\r\nwith golden stars; his _berretta_, or cap, was turned up with ermine\r\nand trimmed with gold lace, pearls, and silver embroidery, like the\r\nrays of stars. The crimson coats of cloth worn by the Priors were also\r\nlined with ermine, and had ermine collars and cuffs, and they wore a\r\nlarge red berretta or a hood. The Podestà dressed like the Priors, but\r\nwithout a hood; the Preposto’s coat was of black satin, and his _lucco_\r\nof black velvet was lined with satin of various colours, and he always\r\nwore a hood. Seated thus in state, the Signori received tribute from\r\nall the cities, castles, and villages that were under their rule or\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nDati enlarges on the magnificent and marvellous aspect of the Piazza\r\ndella Signoria, “with one hundred towers, which shone like gold, some\r\non waggons, some borne on the shoulders of men. These last, made of\r\nwood, pasteboard, and coloured wax figures, are called tapers (_ceri_).\r\nInside the towers are men, who cause these figures to move and to turn\r\nround. They represented horsemen tilting, foot-soldiers with spears\r\nor waving banners, and girls dancing in a ring. Near and around the\r\n_ringhiera_ hung a hundred or more _palii_ or banners, their staves\r\nbeing stuck into the iron rings on the walls. First were those of\r\nthe chief cities who send tribute to the Commune, as Pisa, Arezzo,\r\nPistoja, Volterra, Cortona, Lucignano, and Castiglione Aretino, and of\r\ncertain lords of Poppi and Piombino, who are under the protection of\r\nthe Commune, made of thick velvet, lined with satin or with silk; the\r\nrest are of strips of thinner velvet, or of other cloth or silk; so\r\nthat the sight is truly marvellous. The first offering in the morning\r\nis made by the Captains of the Guelph party, with all their knights\r\nand gentlemen, and ambassadors and foreign knights who accompany them,\r\nand a great number of the most honourable citizens of Florence; the\r\ngreat banner of the Guelph party being borne before them by one of\r\ntheir followers on a tall horse, caparisoned in white cloth embroidered\r\nwith the device of the Guelph party. Then followed the afore-mentioned\r\n_palii_, or banners, each one carried by a man on horseback, and both\r\nman and horse are clothed in silk. One after another they go in the\r\norder in which they were called to offer the said _palii_ to the church\r\nof S. Giovanni, which are the tributes paid by the places conquered by\r\nthe Florentines.\r\n\r\n“The _ceri_, or tapers, which resemble golden towers, are the tributes\r\nof the most ancient possessions of the Florentines, and according to\r\ntheir rank they proceed one after another to offer them to S. Giovanni,\r\nand the next day the tapers are all stuck up round the inside of the\r\nchurch where they remain until the next feast-day, when they are\r\nremoved and used for the altars, and some are sold by auction. After\r\nthe tapers a marvellous quantity of large wax candles are offered,\r\nsome of a hundred pounds weight, some of fifty or less, carried by the\r\npeasants belonging to the villas from whence they are sent. Then the\r\nMasters of the Mint offer a splendid taper, borne on a richly adorned\r\ncar drawn by a pair of oxen whose loin-cloths bear the device of the\r\nMint, and the said Masters are accompanied by about four hundred\r\nvenerable men, all matriculated in and belonging to the Guild of\r\nCloth-weavers. The last to make offerings are the Signori, the Priors,\r\nand their colleagues, with the Podestà and the Captain, in great pomp\r\nwith many servants, and so many instruments, fifes and trumpets, that\r\nthe whole world seemed to resound. After the Signori had left, all\r\nthe horses that have come for the race are presented, and then the\r\nFlemings and Brabanters--weavers of woollen cloth--who are in Florence\r\nmake their offering; and lastly, twelve prisoners, delivered from gaol\r\nfor love of God in honour of S. Giovanni, are offered to him. When\r\nall this has been done, men and women return home to dine, and in\r\nall the city that day are so many marriages and great banquets, with\r\ninnumerable fifes, music, songs, dances, and gaiety, that it seemed as\r\nthough the place was Paradise.”\r\n\r\nIn 1466 Piero sent Lorenzo, then eighteen years of age, to Rome on a\r\nmission of great moment both politically and commercially. Perhaps the\r\nmost important part of the private business was to secure from the Pope\r\na monopoly of working the alum mines discovered not many years before\r\nin the short range of volcanic hills lying round the little village\r\nof La Tolfa (Tofa), about eleven miles due west of Civita Vecchia and\r\nwithin the Pope’s dominions. A few deposits of alum had been known and\r\npartially worked in Europe, _i.e._ at Volterra and Ischia: but for\r\nall practical purposes almost all the alum used in Christendom came\r\nfrom Asia Minor, and the supply was always inferior to the increasing\r\ndemand. A certain Giovanni di Castro prospecting among the hills\r\nround La Tolfa found what he believed to be an inexhaustible supply,\r\n“seven hills of alum.” Castro made sure of his find by calcinating\r\nthe stone. He then hastened to Rome, appeared before the Pope, and\r\nsomewhat grandiloquently announced his discovery. “I make known to you\r\na victory over the Turk. He draws yearly from the Christians more than\r\n300,000 pieces of gold, paid to him for the alum with which we dye\r\nwool of various colours, because none is found in Italy, save a little\r\nat Ischia.... I have found seven hills so abounding in alum that they\r\nmight supply seven worlds. If you will send workmen, cause furnaces\r\nto be built and the stone to be calcined, you may furnish almost all\r\nEurope, and what money the Turk used to acquire will fall into your\r\nhands.” The Holy See made haste to secure the newly-found treasure, and\r\nin order to have a monopoly in the sale the Pope excommunicated every\r\none who tried to import alum into Europe from the Turkish dominions. So\r\ndetermined were the Popes to maintain what in modern language would be\r\ncalled their “corner in alum,” that in the proclamation of Indulgences\r\nit was always expressly declared that the pardon promised did not\r\ninclude those who imported alum into Europe from the Turkish dominions.\r\n\r\nSuch a deposit needed capital to work it properly and the Holy See\r\nfarmed out the monopoly, protected by excommunication, to a firm of\r\ncapitalists. Young Lorenzo was instructed to secure, and did obtain,\r\nthis very valuable concession for his family. Hereafter the profits of\r\nthe monopoly of alum were a source of great wealth to the Medici.\r\n\r\nThe political problem, overshadowing all others, entrusted to the\r\nyouthful Lorenzo was the maintenance of the league between the King of\r\nNaples, Milan, and Florence. This was the keystone of Piero’s foreign\r\npolicy. He believed it to be essential to the balance of power and the\r\npreservation of peace in the peninsula. The alliance received an almost\r\ndeadly blow in the somewhat sudden death of Francesco Sforza, the Duke\r\nof Milan, and Piero’s fears are reflected in the despairing letters\r\nhe wrote to his son. The league between the three powers survived the\r\nshock. Francesco Sforza’s son Galeazzo was, after some little delay,\r\nuniversally recognised as his father’s successor, and the foreign\r\npolicy of Piero de’ Medici was maintained.\r\n\r\nBut the note of despair in Piero’s letters was probably occasioned\r\nby a presentiment of what might, and what actually did, occur within\r\nFlorence herself. As has been said, many of the hitherto strenuous\r\nsupporters of the Medici within the Republic were inclined to revolt\r\nagainst the continuance of their rule, and the death of Francesco\r\nSforza furnished the occasion for testing their strength. It had been\r\npart of Cosimo’s foreign policy to support Sforza at Milan by a subsidy\r\nfrom the Florentine treasury. On his death the question was at once\r\nraised whether the grant was to be continued to his successor Galeazzo.\r\nPiero supported its continuance. It was part of the Triple Alliance and\r\nan essential portion of his foreign policy. Yet it was also capable\r\nof being represented as something which concerned only the internal\r\naffairs of the city. This was at once seized upon by Luca Pitti and\r\nDiotisalvi Neroni. We see all these fears reflected in the letters of\r\nPiero to Lorenzo while the latter was at Rome.\r\n\r\nThe letter from Luigi Pulci shows how the young Lorenzo was already\r\nrecognised as one of the foremost citizens of Florence and the future\r\nlord of the city, round whom aspiring men desired to rally. Pulci\r\nhad been banished from Florence and was in hiding on account of his\r\nbrother’s debts for which he had become surety.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuigi Pulci _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici[102]\r\n\r\n _Sis felix, mi Laurenti_, &c.--Thou hast decided to leave me in these\r\n woods among the snow, so lonely and so desolate, and to go to Rome.\r\n Such is my destiny that to all my other troubles is added this one,\r\n that I am never to go a journey with thee on horseback. When shall\r\n I go? When I am quite old? What more faithful servant or companion\r\n canst thou find who is more maltreated and repulsed by heaven? How\r\n many times have we talked together about Rome, and that I was to be\r\n there with thee: why dost thou leave me, art thou afraid I should be\r\n an expense to thee? Do not fear, for in spite of my adverse fortune I\r\n should still do thee honour. From thee I should only need a horse. I\r\n have so many friends in that city and enough wits not to shame thee as\r\n perhaps thou fearest. Of a truth thou drivest me from thee wrongfully,\r\n and it would be unjust to leave me so unhappy: this hurts me more than\r\n anything else. Do not cast me aside like old broken iron, I shall\r\n be sound enough if thou lovest me. And even were I broken to bits I\r\n should have the more need of help and comfort. In the midst of thy\r\n prosperity remember my misfortunes. Generous hearts and true friends\r\n act thus; and my old affection and well-tried fidelity merit it. Time\r\n will pass. It would be a great restorative after so many troubles\r\n which I have now unjustly suffered for sixteen months. It will\r\n prevent me from going to the devil, or into exile in strange lands\r\n with strange thoughts. _Denique_, by all the Gods, by everything, I\r\n pray thee to include me among the number of thy elected for Rome;\r\n it will be enough, as I said before, if thou lendest me a horse. If\r\n thou dost not want me, I will never more be thine nor any one’s. So\r\n good-bye. I leave thee for a long time, thou wilt not see me again,\r\n nor wilt thou know where I am, and God will pardon thee for me, for I\r\n will never pardon thee. Also, if thou willst, surely some means can\r\n be found for my security. The magistrates can protect me, and if they\r\n set me free, as would only be just, a safe-conduct voted by six of the\r\n Signori would be sufficient, or it would be enough if the creditors\r\n promised thee not to molest me. But thou hast forgotten me and art\r\n occupied, and thy mind is set on greater things. Thou art right, but\r\n also, certes, I am not in the wrong to trust in thee alone, because\r\n I am entirely thine and turn to thee as I have always done. If thou\r\n dost not help me I have lost all hope. What am I to do? Give myself to\r\n three hundred thousand devils?\r\n\r\n If thou hast not received the swords tell me and I will go and wake\r\n the man up; and if thou wilt send me a line written by thee, so that I\r\n may know whether thou still lovest me or not, I should be very glad.\r\n Many times have I taken my pen in hand for love of thee, so I wish\r\n thou wouldst deign do the same for love of me. This alone will be to\r\n me, among these mountains, what the Holy Ghost was to the Apostles\r\n who thought God had forgotten them until the dove came to them. If\r\n thou dost not do it no more verses, no more gossipings, never more\r\n shall we be boon-companions. Tell me whether the affair we talked\r\n about under the Tetto de’ Pisani is concluded and whether it will be\r\n necessary; thou hast probably already tried a portion of it. Commend\r\n me to our Magnificent Piero and to Madonna Lucrezia, and greet and\r\n bless my Giuliano a thousand times, and also my Piero Allamanni and\r\n Berlinghieri and Braccio and Gismondo, and all our friends, not\r\n forgetting Messer Gentile.--At Vernia, February 1, 1465 (1466).\r\n\r\n                                Thy Luigi, as content as he can be.[103]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici _to his son_ Lorenzo _at Rome_\r\n\r\n I am in such affliction and sorrow for the sad and untimely death of\r\n the Illustrious Duke of Milan that I know not where I am; thou canst\r\n imagine what it means to us both in private and in public matters.\r\n Condole most heartily in my name with his ambassador, and take comfort\r\n in thine own thoughts and do not give way to melancholy, which is\r\n of no service; thoughts are sometimes useful when they are good. I,\r\n although it is a hard blow, am trying to bear it and I hope time will\r\n accomplish what as yet reason cannot. There are letters from Milan\r\n of the 9th and the 10th which I send, so that thou canst see how\r\n things are there. They may perhaps turn out better than many people\r\n think. I wrote at once to the Holy Father to beg him, as head and\r\n leader not only of the League but of all Christians, to think how\r\n best to preserve the stability of that State, for His Holiness can\r\n do more than any one else, if only for the preservation of peace and\r\n tranquillity in Italy. Although I think His Holiness is well disposed\r\n yet we must do our utmost, for thou knowest what we owe and what\r\n is our duty to the blessed memory of the late Lord and towards Her\r\n Excellency Madonna and her noble children. Put an end to all playing\r\n on instruments, or singing or dancing, for Malatesta has arrived, so\r\n let all be at least until after Easter. Do not talk about it because\r\n I think we may have to change our plans. But thou shalt know what I\r\n decide; meanwhile keep silence with all save Giovanni [Tornabuoni] and\r\n Malatesta.\r\n\r\n I see that thou hast arrived safely by thy letter of 8th, of which I\r\n am glad, and that great honours were paid thee, for which we must be\r\n grateful to God and to the men of this world to whom we owe much. Thou\r\n must study to merit this by deeds and be old beyond thine years, for\r\n the times require it.\r\n\r\n Of what happens there day by day, as I said before, take counsel with\r\n Giovanni, and study the condition of that region and what state it is\r\n in, so that on thy return thou canst give a clear report. No more at\r\n present. Christ guard thee.\r\n\r\n I forgot to say that last night letters of the 11th came from Mantua,\r\n saying how that lord had agreed and stipulated to remain in the\r\n service of King Ferrante [of Naples]; this is a good and useful thing.\r\n We have also letters of the 11th to-day from Genoa, with news that\r\n all those citizens have determined to be faithful to Madonna and\r\n her children as they were to the Duke of blessed memory, and that\r\n they have elected eight citizens to act with the governor in case of\r\n need.--Florence, March 15, 1465 (1466).[104]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici _to his son_ Lorenzo _at Rome_\r\n\r\n I wrote fully to thee lately, and now have thy letter of 15th saying\r\n that the death of the Duke of Milan was known there, may God be\r\n merciful to him, and of the arrangements made to send to Milan and\r\n to write to others, and also of the Holy Father’s decision as to the\r\n safety of that State, which satisfies every one. We are of the same\r\n opinion; to do all that is possible for the Illustrious Madonna and\r\n their noble children that accords with our own liberty. Probably\r\n nothing more will be needed than the intimation of our intentions, as\r\n up to the 17th, the last news I have from Milan, nothing had happened,\r\n all passed off quietly. From what one hears from Venice the Signoria\r\n there shows a desire to live in peace and quiet with Madonna and her\r\n sons, as they did with the father of blessed memory. I am inclined\r\n to believe this, it being their interest. I say no more, having told\r\n thee enough in my other letter, and also because I send thee the\r\n letter I have received from Venice. It is however of the greatest\r\n importance and utility that His Sanctity our Holy Father should desire\r\n to preserve peace and quiet in Italy, in which I conceive he will have\r\n the aid of us all. I am sure that this is his desire, he having always\r\n shown it, so I do not dwell on it, hoping that by the grace of God and\r\n the help of His Holiness everything will go well.\r\n\r\n I note that thou hast seen His Sanctity the Pope, and spoken about\r\n the affair of Stefano da Osimo, and that His Holiness is satisfied;\r\n it is necessary for the common good of the different parties and\r\n of the whole city, and it seems to me that our Holy Father has\r\n understood rightly and sagely that the affair cannot be ended but\r\n must be maintained. It may be that time will make a change also in my\r\n views. It is enough to know that it was not _de motu proprio_ of His\r\n Holiness, but was suggested by others. But above all see that he is\r\n satisfied and content; were it otherwise I should be uneasy.\r\n\r\n I know not what thou hast done about the deposit of alum, as I said\r\n before I am content that thou shouldst accept it in my name, and\r\n there can be no doubt that our conduct will be to the satisfaction\r\n and the interest of our Holy Father. Consult about this with Giovanni\r\n Tornabuoni, and settle this and other matters as you both think best.\r\n\r\n About continuing thy journey beyond Rome I think, as I said before, it\r\n would be better to wait until after Easter; we shall meanwhile know\r\n more and be better able to decide. Thou hast done well to urge Messer\r\n Agnolo to make haste, we expect him here every day. Return the letters\r\n from Milan which I sent in my last letter, and those which I now send.\r\n Here we are expecting to hear of the entry of the Illustrious Galeazzo\r\n Maria. The Count of Urbino was at Scarperia on the 18th but did not\r\n come here, probably not to lose time. By now he must be at Milan, as\r\n well as the Lord Alessandro. Thou shalt hear what occurs. The Lord\r\n Gismondo had arrived at Venice.\r\n\r\n The Archdeacon was at the point of death, but he is so much better\r\n that it is not expected he will die of this illness. I highly approve\r\n of thy thought of Pellegrino, and if the occasion had arisen would\r\n have shown him how greatly I desire to please and to serve him. When\r\n thou seest the Bishop of Raugia commend me to him, and also to Messer\r\n Lionardo Dati. No more. Christ guard thee.--On the 22nd day of March\r\n 1465 (1466).[105]\r\n\r\nAfter the conspiracy against Piero de’ Medici had been discovered,\r\nAgnolo Acciaiuoli fled to Siena on his way to Naples. There he waited\r\nsome time in the vain hope that Piero would relent and permit him to\r\nreturn to Florence. At last he wrote the following letter, which as\r\ngiven by Fabroni, who copied from the archives, differs somewhat from\r\nthe more literary version given by Machiavelli.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Acciaiuoli _to_ Piero de’ Medici. _Siena, 17th Sept. 1466_\r\n\r\n _Spectabilis vir Frater honorande_,--I laugh at what I see. God has\r\n put it in thy power to cancel all the debts I have against thee, and\r\n thou dost not know how to do it. I lost my country and my estates for\r\n thy father, thou art in the position to restore all to me. I prevented\r\n his being despoiled, now corn and other belongings are taken from me;\r\n thou canst save them; be not tardy in showing thou art not ungrateful;\r\n I do not say this for my belongings, although I have need of them, so\r\n much as for thy reputation. I commend myself to thee.[106]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici _to_ Agnolo Acciaiuoli. _Florence, 22nd Sept. 1466_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice eques tanquam Pater honorande_,--Your laughter is the cause\r\n of my not shedding tears, although I am sorry for your ill fortune.\r\n You have not shown your accustomed good sense, which in such cases is\r\n necessary. Your guilt, as I said in a former letter, is manifest and\r\n so great that neither my intercession nor that of any other person\r\n would be of any avail. My nature is to forget and forgive you, and\r\n all who have shown me enmity and hostility. I have pardoned every\r\n offence; the Republic cannot and may not lightly do so on account of\r\n the bad example, as you know better than I, having had experience of\r\n such matters and having proclaimed it in public and in private. You\r\n say you were exiled on my father’s account, and for having saved what\r\n belonged to him. I do not deny your friendship with my father and with\r\n us, which ought to have made you regard me as a son, and as such I\r\n considered myself. You were banished with my father and were recalled\r\n with him, according to the pleasure of the Republic, which has full\r\n power over us. I do not conceive that our friendship was in any way\r\n hurtful or dishonourable to you as can be clearly demonstrated, and\r\n if obligations and benefits were weighed, perhaps the scale would\r\n not be equal, although from what you write you do not seem to think\r\n so. I always considered myself beholden to you, but if you examine\r\n your conscience you will see that you have exempted me from any\r\n obligations; nevertheless I am willing to remain your debtor in so far\r\n as it touches me privately, but the public injury I cannot, will not,\r\n and may not pardon. For myself personally I forget everything, forgive\r\n all wrongs, and remain as a son ought to be towards such a father.[107]\r\n\r\nIn 1466 Piero de’ Medici’s daughter Nannina was married to Bernardo\r\nRucellai, son of Giovanni, who built the beautiful palazzo Rucellai\r\nafter the designs of his friend Leon Battista Alberti. Giovanni spent\r\n3686 golden florins on the festivities for his son’s wedding, and for\r\nthree days the Florentines danced, ate, drank and listened to music, in\r\nVia della Vigna Nuova. The street, and the loggia (one of the few still\r\nexisting in Florence), which was temporarily enlarged so as to cover\r\nthe small triangular square in front of the palace, were hung with blue\r\ncloth and decorated with flowers. One of Nannina’s sons, Giovanni, is\r\nwell known as the author of _Rosmunda_ and of _Le Api_, the poetical\r\ngifts of Lucrezia thus descending to a second generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuigi Pulci, _from Pisa_, _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici _at Florence_\r\n\r\n _Salve_, &c. I send thee some poems so that thou mayst remember me. I\r\n have a thousand phantasies in my head which thou shalt hear some day\r\n and which will please thee. The poem is nearly finished; then we must\r\n do a more important work, and perhaps three nymphs, who are here, will\r\n come to be judged by a better man than Paris, and we will bestow the\r\n prize to our liking. Whoever is ill pleased shall pay the expenses of\r\n a ball; but I mean to prepare a triumph which shall be praised by thee\r\n and that for me is always sufficient.\r\n\r\n I have nought to say save that I am thine as ever. _Scriptum est._\r\n Commend me to the Magnificent Piero and to Madonna Lucrezia, and to\r\n all at home. _Salutam Vale, et me dilige._--From Pisa, January 12,\r\n 1466 (1467). _Tuus servitor_,\r\n\r\n                                                       Aloysius Pulcher.\r\n\r\n This day Tanai[108] and his wife with about a hundred horse entered\r\n Pisa in great triumph, and _Palle_ resounded everywhere; we shall\r\n amuse ourselves and talk much of thee.[109]\r\n\r\nSeveral brides had been proposed for Lorenzo, and at last Piero decided\r\nfor a daughter of the proud house of Orsini. The suggestion was first\r\nmade by his brother-in-law Giovanni Tornabuoni, head of the Medici bank\r\nat Rome, and treasurer to Sixtus IV. But Lucrezia insisted on seeing\r\nthe girl with her own eyes before coming to a final decision, and in\r\nMarch 1467 set out for Rome, from whence she wrote to her husband:\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici _to her husband_ Piero\r\n\r\n On the way I wrote to thee often and told thee about the roads. I\r\n arrived on Thursday, and was received with much joy by Giovanni, as\r\n thou canst imagine. I have had thy letter of the 21st which consoled\r\n me greatly, hearing that the pains had ceased. But every day seems to\r\n me a year until I return for thy and my consolation.\r\n\r\n On the way to S. Peter on Thursday morning I met Madonna Maddalena\r\n Orsini, sister to the Cardinal [Latino Orsini], with her daughter, who\r\n is about fifteen or sixteen years old. She was dressed in the Roman\r\n fashion with a _lenzuolo_ [long loose shawl or cloak]. In this dress\r\n she seemed to me handsome, fair, and tall, but being so covered up I\r\n could not see her to my satisfaction. Yesterday I paid a visit to the\r\n said Monsignor Orsini in his sister’s house, which adjoins his. When\r\n I had saluted him in thy name his sister came in with the maiden, who\r\n had on a tight frock of the fashion of Rome without the _lenzuolo_. We\r\n talked for some time and I looked closely at the girl. As I said she\r\n is of good height and has a nice complexion, her manners are gentle,\r\n though not so winning as those of our girls, but she is very modest\r\n and would soon learn our customs. She has not fair hair, because here\r\n there are no fair women; her hair is reddish and abundant, her face\r\n rather round, but it does not displease me. Her throat is fairly\r\n elegant, but it seems to me a little meagre, or to speak better,\r\n slight. Her bosom I could not see, as here the women are entirely\r\n covered up, but it appeared to me of good proportions. She does not\r\n carry her head proudly like our girls, but pokes it a little forward;\r\n I think she was shy, indeed I see no fault in her save shyness. Her\r\n hands are long and delicate. In short I think the girl is much above\r\n the common, though she cannot compare with Maria, Lucrezia, and\r\n Bianca.[110] Lorenzo has seen her and thou canst find out whether she\r\n pleases him. Whatever thou and he determine will be well done, and I\r\n shall be content. Let us leave the issue to God.\r\n\r\n The girl’s father is Signor Jacopo Orsini of Monte Rotondo, and her\r\n mother is the Cardinal’s sister. She has two brothers; one a soldier\r\n in the good graces of Signor Orso, the other a priest, sub-deacon of\r\n the Pope. They own the half of Monte Rotondo, the other half belongs\r\n to their uncle, who has two sons and three daughters. Besides this\r\n there are three other castles belonging to her brothers, and as far\r\n as I can learn they are otherwise well provided. They will be still\r\n better off in the future because besides the Cardinal, the Archbishop,\r\n Napoleon, and the Cavalier, being their uncles on the mother’s side,\r\n they are cousins through the father, who is a second cousin in direct\r\n line of the aforesaid gentlemen, and they are all very fond of them.\r\n This is what I have heard. If before treating this matter it seems\r\n well to thee to await our return do as thou thinkest best.\r\n\r\n I intend to leave on Monday week and shall write on the way. So I\r\n shall be at home at the time fixed. I pray God in His mercy to guide\r\n me safely and to keep thee in good health. I do not write to Madonna\r\n Contessina, it seems to me useless. Commend me to her and salute the\r\n girls and Lorenzo and Giuliano.--In Rome, 27th March 1467.\r\n\r\n                                                           Thy Lucrezia.\r\n\r\nA few days later Lucrezia wrote again on the subject which engrossed\r\nall her thoughts:\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici _to her husband_ Piero\r\n\r\n As I told thee in my last letter dictated to Giovanni, our seeing the\r\n girl was managed quietly, without ceremony; so should nothing come of\r\n it thou wilt lose nought, as there has been no parleying. The maiden\r\n has two good qualities, she is tall and fair; her face is not pretty,\r\n but it is not common, and her figure is good. Lorenzo has seen her,\r\n find out whether she pleases him, there are so many advantages that if\r\n he likes her we may be content. Her name is Crarice.\r\n\r\n                                                           Thy Lucrezia.\r\n\r\nLike a true Florentine, Lucrezia turns the _l_ in Clarice into an _r_.\r\nLorenzo had seen the girl without her mother’s knowledge one day at\r\nmass. On the homeward journey Lucrezia writes in answer to a letter\r\nfrom her husband:\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici _to her husband_ Piero\r\n\r\n I have thy letter by Donnino and see the determination thou hast\r\n taken, which pleases me. I am sure when I get home and tell thee all\r\n thou wilt be well satisfied, particularly as Lorenzo is pleased. We\r\n did not see the girl again, but that does not surprise me. Thou sayest\r\n I write coldly about her: I do it not to raise thy hopes too high:\r\n there is no handsomer girl at present unmarried in Florence. On my\r\n return I will tell thee all, and as I said before we shall be able\r\n to arrange matters, so at present I will say no more. I arrived here\r\n very tired, the road was so bad, and we had so much rain that little\r\n was left of me, but after resting I am well. We were to have left on\r\n Monday, but it does nothing but rain, so they have persuaded me to\r\n wait a little. All is ready, and as soon as the weather is favourable\r\n we shall start, for it seems to me a thousand years since I left. I\r\n commend myself unto thee.--April 1, 1467.\r\n\r\n                                                      Thy Lucrezia.[111]\r\n\r\nThe long journey and the damp told on Lucrezia who was never strong,\r\nand at Foligno she fell seriously ill.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici _to her husband_ Piero\r\n\r\n I know not, she writes, whether it is thanks to these doctors or to\r\n thy letter received last night, but this morning I felt so well that\r\n I hope to set forth in three days. Maestro Girolamo will tell thee\r\n exactly the state of my health, which I think will content thee. I\r\n only lament the many annoyances I have caused thee on my journey.\r\n But believe me, wherever I might have been I should have been ill,\r\n for I have brought up much phlegm and nastiness which must have been\r\n there for a long time. Commend me to Mona Contessina and beg her to\r\n have patience, for soon, as soon as it pleases these doctors, I shall\r\n return to her and maybe she will take better care of me, though here,\r\n thanks be to God, I have wanted for nothing. I know not whether I\r\n should even have had such conveniences at home, certainly not at Rome.\r\n If it seems good to thee that I should send back Messer Gentile for\r\n Giuliano let me know before we start.[112] I shall wait to get quite\r\n well as thou sayest, and to recoup. Meanwhile and always I commend\r\n myself to thee and beg thee to be patient with me.--In Foligno, May 4,\r\n 1467, at 1 o’clock.\r\n\r\n                                                           Thy Lucrezia.\r\n\r\n Yesterday and last night I slept, as the Maestro will have told thee,\r\n as though quite well.[113]\r\n\r\nAfter her return to Florence the doctors sent Lucrezia early in\r\nSeptember to Bagno a Morba, a place already mentioned in earlier\r\npages. But here, where several letters are given written by Lucrezia\r\nfrom that celebrated spring, a few words may be added on the bathing\r\nhabits of the fifteenth century to show how large a part they played\r\nin the social life of the time. For it is a delusion to think that the\r\nfrequent use of water, cold or hot, is a modern virtue. It is true that\r\nfrom the middle of the sixteenth century till the end of the eighteenth\r\nmen and women washed but sparingly. Marguerite de Valois could say to\r\nher lover, “See these fair hands. Though they have not been washed\r\nfor eight days, they are cleaner than yours.” Manuals of Etiquette,\r\npublished in 1667 and in 1782, recommend ladies and gentlemen to clean\r\ntheir faces with a dry white linen cloth, because to wash the face\r\nwith water makes it more susceptible to cold in winter and to tan in\r\nsummer. But in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the use of water\r\nwas nearly as common as it is now. The whole population, whether north\r\nor south of the Alps, rejoiced in bathing. They used cold baths, hot\r\nbaths, and steam baths; they gathered to bathe in mineral water; above\r\nall they delighted in baths when the water came from hot springs, and\r\nthose were most prized which were strongly impregnated with sulphur,\r\nas was the case at Morba. The site of many an Italian monastery was\r\nselected simply because it was near enough a hot spring for the monks\r\nto enjoy what was looked on almost as necessary to healthy living.\r\nIndeed one of the punishments inflicted on unruly members of the\r\ncommunity was a prohibition to use the bath. The Italian doctors\r\ndistinguished between _Stupha_, or hot air, and _Balneum_, or hot water\r\nbaths. Rubbing and even scratching whilst bathing was recommended, and\r\nArnaldo di Villa Nuova (1300-1366) ordered his elderly patients to be\r\nwell rubbed when in the water, and to take a herb-bath four times a\r\nmonth. Soap, and sometimes lye, was used, and Italian soap was in great\r\nrequest, particularly in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe hot sulphur springs of Morba had been known for centuries, and\r\nbelonged to the Commune of Volterra, as is mentioned in a document of\r\n1297. They lie some ten miles south of the old Etruscan city, in that\r\npart of the Apennines dominated by the imposing Monte Cerbole, in a\r\nregion which then and now produced borax and alum. The wild desolate\r\nscenery gave rise to legends. It was said that on stormy nights a fiery\r\nchariot drawn by fiery horses rushes along the mountain side, and then\r\nwith a terrific noise which drowns thunder and wind, dashes down into\r\nthe valley leading to the lagoons of Larderello, which were supposed\r\nto be the mouths of hell, and disappears. After the apparition of the\r\nchariot, the jets of white sulphureous smoke which always rise more or\r\nless from the grey soil are more dense and hiss like great serpents as\r\nthey curl upwards to the sky. It is altogether an uncanny place. Here\r\nand there the black mud bubbles and boils, rising up in small cones\r\nwhich subside with a strange rumbling noise like the hoarse barking or\r\ngrowling of a distant watchdog. The ground sounds hollow under foot,\r\nand shakes if you walk near any of the blowholes, while the smell of\r\nrotten eggs, so characteristic of sulphur springs, is overpowering,\r\nparticularly after rain.\r\n\r\nThe famous baths are not far off. They had been largely deserted,\r\nconduits broken, bathing-houses tumbling down, everything neglected\r\nand falling to ruin. The sulphureous springs, left to find their way\r\nthrough the rocks and the soil, were wasted and produced nothing but\r\nevil-smelling ooze. When the Florentines became masters of Volterra\r\nthey sent Doctor Ugolino da Montecatini with their Chancellor Colucci\r\nda Salutati to report on the virtues of the waters in 1388. Something\r\nwas done to render the baths useful and productive. The village with\r\nits small castle was rebuilt and surrounded with a sheltering wall.\r\nVisitors were protected from the sudden assaults of the robber nobles\r\nwhose castles crowned neighbouring heights, and who swooped down on\r\nthe bathers in hopes of plunder and ransom. The baths regained some of\r\ntheir old prosperity, and gouty or rheumatic Florentines braved the\r\ndiscomforts of the road to make use of the waters. Cosimo Pater Patriæ\r\nvisited them frequently, and on a memorable occasion a favourite pair\r\nof scissors were left in his lodgings, which Contessina tells her son\r\nGiovanni to send back to Florence (p. 55). The probability is, however,\r\nthat the arrangements were anything but luxurious when Lucrezia first\r\ntried and found the benefits of the healing springs.\r\n\r\nShe soon saw the advantages of the position, and after buying the\r\nvillage and baths of Morba in 1477 from the Commune of Florence, in\r\ntrue Florentine fashion at once made plans which would benefit the\r\nplace, its visitors, her own health, and her pocket. The valuable\r\nwater was largely wasted; cisterns were needed; more springs might\r\nbe discovered. Accordingly experts were engaged, the ground was\r\ninvestigated, and work was carefully planned. The known springs were\r\ncleared, the water was carefully collected and brought into a great\r\ncovered cistern built of well-burnt bricks and covered with tiles\r\naccording to the most approved pattern of the day. Search was made for\r\nother springs; the streamlets were followed back to their sources in\r\nneighbouring rocks. Soon the supply of water was more than doubled.\r\nMeanwhile the bathing-houses with their twelve separate baths were\r\nrebuilt. Old engravings enable us to form some idea of these Italian\r\nbaths, which were made much more luxurious than those north of the\r\nAlps. There is no trace of that promiscuous bathing so common in\r\nGermany. Either the sexes had separate bathing-houses or, what is\r\nmore probable, used the same baths at different hours. We see a room\r\nwith one or more oblong baths set in the floor, and to each bathroom\r\nwas attached a smaller apartment with a bed for the hour of repose\r\nenjoined after bathing. The bathing establishment was a long row of\r\nsuch bathrooms completely separate from each other. At first the same\r\nstream of water served all the baths at Morba, but it was found that\r\nthose nearest the cisterns were too hot, while those furthest from\r\nthem were too cold. The defect was remedied by an ingenious system of\r\nconduits. Provision was made in each bathroom for shower or douche\r\nbaths, the water being conducted along the walls in open gutters\r\npierced with holes above each wooden tub. Lucrezia also built a large\r\nhouse which served as an hotel and, as at Cauterets--the favourite\r\nbathing resort of Marguerite d’Angoulême, the Queen of Navarre, where\r\nthere was a _Maison du Roi_, while the other bathers lived in _cabanes\r\net logis_--there was a “small palace” for her own use and that of her\r\nfamily. It must have been a thorough holiday for the energetic and busy\r\nwoman, for, as the Queen of Navarre said, “while at the baths one must\r\nlive as free from care as a child.”\r\n\r\nLorenzo accompanied his mother to Morba, but there was a report which\r\nseems to have been well founded, though Piero in his letter to her\r\ntreats it as an idle dream, that the Florentine exiles had resolved\r\nto attack the place and capture both mother and son. So Lucrezia\r\ninvented some pretext to send him back to Florence, and the family\r\ndoctor prevented his return. It will be noticed that although children\r\nin those days spoke of their parents by their Christian names, yet they\r\nalmost always wrote _voi_ (you) in addressing them. Only husband and\r\nwife and parents used the familiar _tu_ (thou). _Lei_, now universally\r\nused to all but near relations or great friends, is never met with.\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to his mother_ Lucrezia _at Bagno a Morba_\r\n\r\n I thought I should have been with you by now, but the weather has\r\n become much cooler, and Maestro Mariotti does not think it would be\r\n good for my eczema to return there. Therefore I have determined not\r\n to come. Piero has promised to go and see you either with Messer\r\n Benedetto or soon afterwards. Let us find that you are so improved\r\n in health that nothing more will be necessary. We are all well here,\r\n particularly Piero, whose only need is to hear oftener about you; in\r\n truth, whether from the negligence of the writer or perhaps of the\r\n messenger, till now we have had but scant news. Therefore to satisfy\r\n us all, more particularly Piero, see that we get your answers more\r\n quickly, and apply yourself diligently to benefit from your sojourn\r\n there. I commend myself to you.--In Florence on the 19th day of\r\n September 1467.\r\n\r\n I should be glad if you send me back my purple _cioppetta_ (tunic) as\r\n I have nought to wear, the other things I do not want.\r\n\r\n                                           Your Lorenzo de’ Medici.[114]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici _to his wife_ Lucrezia _at Morba_\r\n\r\n I wrote to thee a few days ago, and soon afterwards Lorenzo arrived.\r\n It was wiser to send him away from there, although I think they are\r\n all dreams. From him and also from thy letter to Mona Contessina I\r\n learn that thou art better, so I hope for thy complete recovery,\r\n which is indeed certain. It cannot be otherwise after the prayers\r\n and supplications which have been and are being made in places some\r\n of which thou knowest, and in others which thou knowest not. But\r\n what must be attributed to the grace of God is that prayers have\r\n been made by those who know us not, and whom thou hast never known:\r\n a wonderful thing truly, more divine than human, and I steadfastly\r\n believe that owing to these prayers we shall receive grace from God:\r\n but as thou in thy wisdom knoweth we shall remain deeply in debt. God\r\n make us grateful and send us the power to satisfy all. Have faith\r\n and be obedient to the doctors, do not depart one drachm from their\r\n commands, submit and suffer all things, if not for thyself and for us,\r\n for the love of God who shows He will help us. Attend to nought but\r\n to the reason for which thou art there ...[115] give no thought to us,\r\n for we are well and want for nothing ...[115] return well, in better\r\n health than when thou wentest ...[115] are prosperous, and there is\r\n good hope of peace. Giovanni Tornabuoni, if it pleases God, leaves\r\n for Rome to-morrow. Do not trouble to write if thou canst not. Nought\r\n else.--October 1, 1467.\r\n\r\n                                       Piero di Cosimo de’ Medicis.[116]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to his mother_ Lucrezia _at Bagno a Morba_\r\n\r\n I have your letter and am most grieved to hear that your pains have\r\n returned, but as you say they are not so severe I do hope that this\r\n time they will take leave of you, and depart for good. Please God it\r\n may be so, also in the future. I wrote to you that Giovanni had to go;\r\n he went on Saturday; but he could not pass by Bagno a Morba because\r\n he was obliged to leave in great haste; so he will not do as I said.\r\n\r\n I have been too long absent and therefore I shall not be able, as I\r\n wished, to come and see you again, and you will probably not remain\r\n there long. Please God that you return in good health, as you and we\r\n hope. We are all well, Piero especially, and we long to see you soon,\r\n and as we trust well. I commend myself unto you.--In Florence, October\r\n 4, 1467.\r\n\r\n                                           Your Lorenzo de’ Medici.[117]\r\n\r\n\r\nContessina de’ Medici _to her daughter-in-law_ Lucrezia _at Bagno a\r\nMorba_\r\n\r\n Dearest as a Daughter,--This morning I received thy letter by which\r\n with great joy I learn that thou art better, for this we must give\r\n thanks to God and pray with all our hearts that He may restore\r\n thee to perfect health. From Piero I hear continually about thee,\r\n so thou must not tire thyself by writing to me. I sent back by the\r\n messenger the spices asked for, and I received the knives, which\r\n shall be looked to. Do not worry about Ginevra, for I have arranged\r\n and will continue to arrange for her family. The visits in thy name\r\n to Laudomina[118] have been paid and all that was necessary has been\r\n done. She is very discontented although it was a boy. Here all are\r\n well, thanks be to God. I hope it is the same with all of you. No more\r\n at present.--October 25, 1467.\r\n\r\n                                                   Mona Contessina.[119]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici _to his wife_ Lucrezia _at Bagno a Morba_\r\n\r\n Lucrezia mine,--As I know thou wilt understand the letter I have\r\n written to Niccolò I shall not write to thee at length; also because\r\n thy return is nigh at hand, which I await with infinite longing. I\r\n enclose a letter from the Illustrious Madonna Duchess, thou wilt\r\n understand what she says. Show it to Messer Benedetto. See how much\r\n we are beholden to her. We must give thanks to Almighty God, and also\r\n to her when the time comes. No more at present. Christ give thee\r\n health--At Florence on the 12th day of November 1467, at the fifth\r\n hour.\r\n\r\n                                        Piero di Cosimo de’ Medici.[120]\r\n\r\n\r\nLuigi Pulci _from Pisa to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici _at Florence_\r\n\r\n _Salve amicissime_, &c.,--I have been delayed, and shall remain here\r\n several days. I know not whether Tomaso Capponi or my Bernardo[121]\r\n will ask thee to help them about that business; if they do I beg thee\r\n to do so, as is thy wont. If my presence is necessary let me know.\r\n Anyhow I shall come on Saturday, but if I am wanted I am always ready\r\n to leave everything at thy bidding.\r\n\r\n If Gualterotto has not replied about my dog, or if his reply calls for\r\n another letter, I beg thee as warmly as ever I begged for anything to\r\n answer.\r\n\r\n On Friday the Illustrious Duke of Calabria and the Magnificent Luigi\r\n de’ Pulci talked of thee all day long, and said much ill. Thou hast\r\n gained great honour by thy letter given to him by the Captain, he has\r\n followed thy advice, and told me what an admirable letter it was; so\r\n the Captain and he have made a warm friendship. On Sunday night I sup\r\n here with him, and the Captain has charged me to thank thee by letter\r\n and by word of mouth, so he has not written. As I do now by letter, so\r\n will I also do later with my tongue.\r\n\r\n The Illustrious Duke spoke to me about the festival of St. John which\r\n he is most desirous to see, and he charged me to tell thee to help\r\n him and to order that it shall be a fine festival, and said many other\r\n things which I cannot now repeat or give thee to understand, as said\r\n Betto della Centina.\r\n\r\n I have no more to say save that I commend myself to thee. Salute our\r\n Dionigio from me, and tell him this letter is not from Pini,[122] and\r\n that he is to think of me at Pietra al Migliaio. If there is any fear\r\n that the wine should be finished ere I arrive with his own hand he\r\n must measure what remains in the butt, and keep two flasks against my\r\n return, for if I thought I was not to see it any more I should be in\r\n despair.--Pisa, May 30, 1468. _Vale._\r\n\r\n                                                   Thy Luigi Pulci.[123]\r\n\r\n\r\nLuigi Pulci _at Pisa to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n If thou dost not wish it to be known or thought that I am thy friend\r\n and can have all I want from thee, cause it to be published everywhere\r\n at thy expense. As I have had no money to spend I have spent (traded\r\n on) thy reputation. Here I am pointed at wherever I go: that is\r\n Lorenzo’s great friend. Therefore three peasants from Buti will come\r\n to thee, certain Giovanni and Piero and Mariano of Buti, friends of\r\n Piero Vespucci; they have some business about which he has written\r\n and I am requested to recommend them to thee. For love of me be good\r\n to them, for it would give me much pleasure, either with a promise,\r\n or hand them over to whomever thou wilt: only help them in some way.\r\n I will then inscribe it in the book of benefits and obligations I owe\r\n thee.\r\n\r\n No more, I commend myself to thee as usual. God be with thee. _Vale et\r\n me dilige._--From Pisa, May 31, 1468.\r\n\r\n On Sunday evening the Duke and I shall be together. If I am to tell\r\n him aught from thee let me know.\r\n\r\n                                               Thy Luigi de’ Pulci.[124]\r\n\r\n\r\nCardinal Latino Orsini _to_ Piero de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice vir, affinis tanquam frater carissime, salutem_,--With\r\n great joy we have signed what our Johanni Tornabuoni brought us from\r\n you. I hope, thanks be to God, that this thing will conduce to the\r\n well-being of your house and of ours, for it pleases us old people,\r\n also the youth and the maiden, and indeed all. We should be glad to\r\n see our nephew Lorenzo, or _saltem_ his brother, at the feast of the\r\n Nativity. We should give him a magnificent, a quiet, or a middling\r\n reception, according to your wishes, for we only desire to please you\r\n in this: and you may rest assured that all we have is at your disposal\r\n and pleasure. Be careful, I beg of you, to keep well and joyful, thus\r\n nought will be wanting to you or to us.--_Ex Urbe, die 26 Novembris\r\n 1468._\r\n\r\n                              L. Cardinalis De Ursinus,\r\n                              _Manu propria, Episcopus Tusculanus_.[125]\r\n\r\n\r\nFilippo de’ Medici, _Archbishop of Pisa, at Rome, to_ Piero de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice vir, tanquam pater honorande, post commendationem_,\r\n &c.,--By Giovanni Tornabuoni I received your letter, and he has given\r\n me the message from Your Magnificence. It pleases me mightily; I\r\n do not think that in these times Your Magnificence could have done\r\n better. I could not be better pleased or more gratified, considering\r\n that it is for the benefit and the common good of all; therefore I\r\n congratulate Your Magnificence. And that Your Magnificence may be\r\n amply informed about everything, although I know you will hear all\r\n from Giovanni, nevertheless it is my duty to tell you that this very\r\n day, in the name of God, everything has been concluded. The reason\r\n why the contract is not _per verba de presenti_ is that Monsignore\r\n [Cardinal Orsini] does not wish it to be divulged, therefore we send a\r\n sketch of the contract according to his desire; the one sent to us was\r\n simple enough. Everything has been agreed to in the following fashion,\r\n _videlicet_: That they give a dower of 6000 Roman florins in money,\r\n jewels, and dresses; which they stipulate should return to their heirs\r\n should she not have children or dispose of it by will. They agree that\r\n you should not give her the fourth part of the dower, as is customary\r\n here; and in this and all other matters, the Florentine usage and\r\n custom is to be followed save in the restitution of the dower if she\r\n dies _sine filiis et intestata_. Thus neither the custom here nor the\r\n custom there will be absolutely adhered to, so that both parties will\r\n be content. I have been present at all the arrangements, and they seem\r\n to me honest and reasonable; for you do not need her fortune, and your\r\n own remains to you. It is but reasonable that they should have their\r\n way in something.\r\n\r\n Magnificent Piero, I value the connection much, but they are even more\r\n desirous and glad to be related to you. Of a truth their pleasure is\r\n not to be described. This must be a satisfaction to you, and every\r\n day, if it pleases God, you will be better satisfied, and we also; for\r\n truly if I had a hundred tongues I could not tell Your Magnificence\r\n how pleased I am. Send the contract soon, for it will be impossible to\r\n keep this affair secret, as Pietro d’Arcangelo, chancellor of the Duke\r\n of Urbino, has spoken of it, and these Pazzi have begun to spread the\r\n news.\r\n\r\n You have not sent the letters I asked Your Magnificence for; probably\r\n because you had letters from the King to send here concerning the\r\n affair about which I wrote. If you have them it would be well to send\r\n them as I can assure Your Magnificence that if the friend takes up\r\n the business I have good hopes of success. Whatever Your Magnificence\r\n does in this and other matters about which I shall write will be well\r\n done, as I am certain that Your Magnificence values my well-being\r\n and my honour as much as I do myself. I commend myself to Your\r\n Magnificence, _et quam Deus felicem conservet_.--Rome, November 27,\r\n 1468. _Magnificentie Vestres_,\r\n\r\n                                   _Filius_ Phy. Archiepiscopus Pisanus,\r\n                                   _manus propria_.\r\n\r\n I said above that I had good hopes if the letters are sent, not\r\n because I rely on the benevolence of him who is to do the affair, but\r\n because he, if he wishes to gain a place, must give his companion a\r\n share, who will either do nothing or be obliged to act according to\r\n the will of the other. But he has a great desire to succeed, and will\r\n not give heed to what people say, and therefore will not care much\r\n for those who may claim their share at any cost. The afore-mentioned\r\n affair [the marriage] has not been announced yet to our Lord the\r\n Pope, because it did not seem good to Monsignore to do so before the\r\n contract is here.[126]\r\n\r\nFrancesco Tornabuoni, Lorenzo de’ Medici’s uncle, who together with\r\nhis brother Giovanni was in the Medici bank at Rome, did his best to\r\ninspire his nephew with love for the girl suggested by Giovanni as his\r\nbride by writing flowery descriptions of her.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancesco Tornabuoni _to his nephew_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Not a day passes that I do not see your Madonna Clarice, who has\r\n bewitched me: she improves every day. She is beautiful, she has the\r\n sweetest of manners and an admirable intelligence. It is about eight\r\n days since she began to learn to dance, and each day she learns a\r\n new one; no sooner is it shown her than she knows it. Master Agnolo\r\n had begged her to write to you with her own hand, but nothing would\r\n induce her to do so. Then I begged of her, and she said she would,\r\n only she told me you were evidently extremely occupied with this\r\n tournament; and then arrived Donnino who brought no letter from you.\r\n As you cannot visit her in person at least write to her often, it\r\n would give her great pleasure. Of a truth you have the most perfect\r\n bride in Italy.--January 4, 1469.\r\n\r\n                           Your Francesco di Filippo Tornabuoni in Rome.\r\n\r\nFrancesco’s letter had the desired effect, and Lorenzo wrote to his\r\nbride. Unfortunately his letters are not to be found. Her answers are\r\ntouching in their girlish simplicity, but they show that Clarice,\r\nbrought up in strictly clerical surroundings, was not the woman to\r\ncaptivate the brilliant, rather sceptical Lorenzo.\r\n\r\n\r\nClarice Orsini _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifico consorte, recommandatione_, &c.,--I have received a letter\r\n from you and have understood all you write. That you liked my letter\r\n rejoices me, as I am always desirous to do what pleases you. Then you\r\n say that you write but little; I am content with whatever is your\r\n pleasure, living always in hope for the future. Madonna, my mother,\r\n sends you her blessing. I beg you to commend me to your and my father,\r\n to your and my mother, and to the others you deem right. I always\r\n commend myself to you.--At Rome the 28th day of January 1469.\r\n\r\n                                                Your Clarice De Ursinus.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancesco Tornabuoni _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici, _his nephew_\r\n\r\n In the name of God, on the 16th day of February 1469.\r\n\r\n _Magnifice vir et maior honorandissime_,--This day letters from\r\n Giovanni have come, saying how you jousted in the tournament, and\r\n that Your Magnificence was unhurt and had achieved great honour. As\r\n soon as I heard the news, I went to tell your Madonna Clarice, and\r\n took her a letter from Giovanni, which gave her more pleasure than I\r\n can describe. For four days she has been sad by reason of her fear for\r\n Your Magnificence in the tournament, she also had a slight headache;\r\n as soon as she heard the news the headache disappeared and she was\r\n quite merry. Of Madonna Maddalena [Orsini] I say nought, for it is\r\n impossible to say how contented and happy she is; the only thing she\r\n desires is that you should come here for Lent, for she says she wants\r\n you to see your merchandise before you take it home: it improves every\r\n day. Enclosed you will find a letter from her. Madonna Clarice would\r\n not write, and she bids me say from her that she has a great secret\r\n to tell you which she will entrust to no one, neither will she write\r\n it for fear the letter should go astray. Indeed she longs to see you,\r\n and now the tournament is over you have no valid excuse. She commends\r\n herself to Your Magnificence, and to the Magnificent Piero and Madonna\r\n Contessina, and to Bianca, Nannina, and Giuliano. I have bought some\r\n purple cloth from London for a petticoat _a la romanesca_, which will\r\n I think suit her; she intends to visit all the _perdoni_ (relics) to\r\n pray God for you.\r\n\r\n Nought is talked of here but the splendour of the entertainment given\r\n by you and especially of your own doings; they say no paladin ever\r\n did more than Your Magnificence, and every one rejoices, particularly\r\n your friends. Messer Giovanfrancesco, son of the Marquess of Mantua,\r\n commends himself to Your Magnificence, and sends you many compliments.\r\n I have no more to say at present save to commend myself to Your\r\n Magnificence, praying that God may keep you from all ill.\r\n\r\n                     Your Francesco di Filippo Tornabuoni, in Rome.[127]\r\n\r\n\r\nClarice Orsini _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice consorte, recommandatione_, &c.,--I have received a letter\r\n from you which was most pleasing to me, telling me of the tournament\r\n wherein you gained much honour. I am most glad that you have been\r\n satisfied in a thing which gives you pleasure; and if my prayers have\r\n been granted in this, I, as a person who desires to do something to\r\n give you pleasure, am well satisfied. I beg you to commend me to my\r\n father Piero, to my mother Lucretia, to Madonna Contessina, and to all\r\n others you think right. I commend myself to you. No more.--In Rome the\r\n 25th day of February 1469.\r\n\r\n                                                Your Clarice de Ursinus.\r\n\r\nThe tournament of which Clarice writes was held on February 7, 1469,\r\nin honour of the marriage of Lorenzo’s great friend, Braccio Martello,\r\nand is recorded in a poem by Luigi Pulci.[128] It took place in the\r\nPiazza S. Croce, and cost, as Lorenzo notes in his _Ricordi_, 10,000\r\nducats. This estimate, however, can only refer to the structures and\r\ndecorations in the Piazza S. Croce, and cannot include the money\r\nexpended on personal adornment. The dress of Giuliano alone, then\r\na handsome boy of fifteen, was said to have cost 80,000 ducats. It\r\nwas made of silver brocade strewn with pearls. Lorenzo’s, with its\r\njewels, must have cost a great deal more. He rode to the lists on a\r\nmagnificently caparisoned horse given to him by Ferrante, King of\r\nNaples. Over his surcoat he wore a broad silk scarf, with fresh and\r\nwithered roses embroidered round his motto, _Le Tems Revient_, written\r\nin pearls. In his black velvet cap studded with pearls was a feather\r\nof gold filagree set with diamonds and rubies, and on his shield were\r\ndisplayed the three golden lilies of France on an azure ground, the\r\nprivilege of bearing which was granted to his father Piero in 1465\r\n(see p. 86), while in the centre of the shield blazed the great Medici\r\ndiamond, _Il Libro_. In the Piazza he mounted a charger presented to\r\nhim by Borso d’Este, Duke of Ferrara, and buckled on armour sent by the\r\nDuke of Milan. His prowess is celebrated by Luigi Pulci as rivalling\r\nthe deeds of Orlando and Achilles, and the first prize, a helmet\r\nof silver with a figure of Mars, was assigned to him. Lorenzo more\r\nmodestly states that he was not well versed in the use of weapons and\r\nthe delivery of blows.\r\n\r\nThese Italian tournaments, which we read about so frequently as forming\r\npart of the festivities attending weddings among the richer citizens of\r\nFlorence and other Italian towns, were more processions and pageants\r\nthan the rough-and-tumble feats of arms among northern nations. At one\r\nof the tournaments held during the sitting of the Diet of Augsburg we\r\nare told by a spectator that six competitors were killed: at another\r\nthat Ferdinand, King of the Romans, was thrown violently and his horse\r\nrolled on him, endangering his life. We never hear of such accidents\r\nattending the tame tournaments of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nRinaldo Orsini _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice affinis ac frater honorande, salutem_, &c.,--A few days\r\n ago I heard, but not by any letter of yours, of the tournament and\r\n the honour done to you. God be praised for all, and especially that\r\n you emerged safe and unhurt; in which I think you were aided by the\r\n prayers of your Clarice. Now I have been informed of the wishes of the\r\n Magnificent Piero and your own as to Clarice’s journey to Florence.\r\n Although I should have certainly desired, albeit I have not been\r\n consulted, that your wishes should be followed in this matter, always\r\n subordinate to those of Madonna our mother, who is very sorrowful at\r\n her departure, yet it would only have been seemly if I, as well as\r\n other people, had been written to about this business, for you have no\r\n nearer relation here, nor one who is more desirous to please you in\r\n this and in other matters. So when you want an explanation or anything\r\n done, write openly to me and I shall do my best to satisfy you. Say\r\n also to the Magnificent Piero that in future he is not to apply to\r\n middle-men, for he must dispose of me as he would of a son. _Bene\r\n valete._--Rome, February 26, 1469.\r\n\r\n                                    Rainaldus De Ursinus,\r\n                                    _Apostolice Sedis subdiaconus_.[129]\r\n\r\n\r\nMaddalena Orsini _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice vir, et mi fili benedicte, salutem_,--I have had a letter\r\n from you which is most welcome, in which you say that your coming here\r\n depends upon the will of the Magnificent Piero and the opinion of his\r\n Lordship the Cardinal. I am quite content with whatever pleases them.\r\n How glad I should be to see you before sending my daughter I cannot\r\n express, but I am sure the Magnificent Piero knows best, and that we\r\n shall never err by carrying out his commands. At all events I hope you\r\n have the wish to know me and all your relations here. No more. God\r\n preserve you ever in good health and happiness. Clarice is well and\r\n commends herself to all.--Rome, March 4, 1469.\r\n\r\n                                             Maghdalena De Ursinus.[130]\r\n\r\n\r\nFilippo de’ Medici, _Archbishop of Pisa_, _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice vir et frater honorande_, &c.,--I hardly know how to\r\n express to Your Magnificence with what pleasure and contentment I\r\n have this day espoused in your name the Magnificent and noble Madonna\r\n Clarice degl’ Orsini, a maiden whose looks, carriage, and manners I\r\n conceive merit the bridegroom who was I think destined for her by\r\n Heaven. For this Your Magnificence ought devoutly to thank God who\r\n in this, as in other matters wherein you have been so well treated\r\n by fortune, has protected you; and I, who desire your well-being\r\n and honour as ardently as any one, for many reasons have longed for\r\n this day and congratulate Your Magnificence _ex intimo cordis_; may\r\n it be productive of all good. I pray our Lord Jesus Christ to grant\r\n to both a happy and a long life together and to let you see _filios\r\n filiorum vestrorum usque in quartam et quintam generationem_. I will\r\n say no more because from Giovanni [Tornabuoni] you will have heard\r\n everything. If I can do aught for your service let me know, and I will\r\n do it as willingly as any one alive, as I am sure Your Magnificence\r\n knows _quam Deas diu felicem conservet_.[131]\r\n\r\nLorenzo in his _Ricordi_ writes: “I, Lorenzo, took to wife Clarice,\r\nthe daughter of Signor Jacopo Orsini, or rather she was given to me\r\n(_i.e._ betrothed), in December 1468 and the marriage was celebrated in\r\nour house on the 4th June 1469. Till now I have by her two children,\r\na daughter called Lucrezia ... years old, and a son called Piero ...\r\nmonths old. King Ferrante is the godfather of the girl. She is again\r\nwith child. God spare her to us for a long time and preserve her from\r\nall ill” (see p. 153).\r\n\r\nThe following description of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s wedding is taken from\r\na contemporary manuscript existing in Codex 574, Class xxv. of the\r\nStrozziani MSS. in the National Library of Florence. There is no record\r\nof the writer in the manuscript, but his name appears in the catalogue\r\nof the Library as Piero di Marco Parenti, and it may be that it was\r\non the cover which is wanting. Born in Florence in January 18, 1450,\r\nParenti died in May 1519, and according to Moreni was the author of\r\nseveral other works which still exist in manuscript in the Library. The\r\nname of the person to whom the letter was written does not appear, but\r\nfrom people mentioned, and other indications, he may have been Filippo\r\ndi Matteo Strozzi, the builder of the fine Palazzo Strozzi in Florence,\r\nwho was then in Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Account of the Wedding of_ Lorenzo di Piero di Cosimo, _according\r\nto what was told me by Cosimo Bartoli, one of the principal Directors\r\nof the Festival, particularly as regards Sweetmeats and Sugar-plums,\r\nand also what I saw myself_.\r\n\r\n On Friday, which was the 2nd of June, the presents offered by the\r\n countryside began to arrive from the principal towns, Pisa, Arezzo,\r\n and other communes, villas, and castles. All presented eatables, such\r\n as calves, fowls, geese, wine, sweetmeats, wax, and fish. I send you\r\n the exact list as far as I could get it. The presentations of these\r\n went on all day on Saturday with great noise and rejoicings: and on\r\n that day pieces of veal of from 10 to 20 lbs. in weight were given to\r\n 800 citizens. You and I were among the number.\r\n\r\n  Calves, 150.\r\n\r\n  More than 2000 couples of capons, geese, and fowls.\r\n\r\n  Sea fish and trout in large quantities. I do not yet know how many.\r\n\r\n  Sweet things in abundance; sugar-plums as big as arbutus berries,\r\n  almonds, pine-seeds, sweetmeats, also the imitations thereof from\r\n  there [Naples?]. The number I do not yet know.\r\n\r\n  Wax I know not how much.\r\n\r\n  Many hundreds of flasks of wine and several casks of foreign wines,\r\n  such as malvasy and the like, and of native red wine.\r\n\r\n  Of corn, oats, and the like, I do not think there was much.\r\n\r\n On Sunday morning the bride left the house of Benedetto degl’\r\n Alessandri on the big horse given to Lorenzo by the King [of Naples],\r\n preceded by many trumpeters and fifers, and surrounded by the\r\n youths usually in attendance on marriage festivities, well clothed.\r\n Behind her came two cavaliers, Messer Carlo and Messer Tommaso, on\r\n horseback with their retainers, who according to the usage of the city\r\n accompanied her to her husband’s house which was most sumptuously\r\n adorned, and where a stage had been erected in the street for\r\n dancing. As she dismounted the bride’s retinue arrived from the house\r\n of the Alessandri: thirty young matrons and maidens most richly\r\n dressed, and among them was your Fiammetta, one of the two handsomest\r\n there. They were accompanied by another set of youths dressed for\r\n dancing and preceded by trumpeters. Thirty other maidens were in\r\n Lorenzo’s house to receive the bride and her retinue. After the olive\r\n tree, to the sound of much music, had been hauled up to the windows,\r\n all went to dinner. The tree was arranged in a vase like those used on\r\n the triumphal cars for the feast of S. Giovanni and was almost like a\r\n _trionfo_.\r\n\r\n The order of the banquets, of which there were five, was alike on the\r\n mornings of Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.\r\n\r\n The bride, with about fifty maidens who were the dancers, ate in the\r\n garden under the loggia which you know, and the tables were set at\r\n the sides as far as the doors, one of which leads into the house,\r\n the other outside. In the loggia which surrounds the courtyard of\r\n the house sat the citizens who had been invited. The tables were\r\n placed on three sides, beginning from the garden, and following the\r\n wall were six tables: here sat from seventy to eighty citizens. In\r\n the ground-floor hall the youths who danced, about thirty-two or\r\n thirty-six, were seated. Forty or more men of more mature age were\r\n occupied in marshalling the banquet, and at every table were two who\r\n acted as seneschals. On a balcony in the great room upstairs dined\r\n the women of a certain age, among them was your mother-in-law Monna\r\n Antonia, and like her were about forty others in the company of Monna\r\n Lucrezia. In short, at the principal tables dined about two hundred\r\n people.\r\n\r\n The order observed in serving was marvellous. For all the dishes were\r\n brought in at the door opening into the street, preceded, as is the\r\n custom, by trumpets. The bearers turned to the right in the loggia\r\n and returned to the foot of the staircase up which some went, while\r\n others passed into the hall to the youths, and others to the maidens\r\n in the garden, and others again remained under the loggie where were\r\n those who had been invited, so that all were served at the same time.\r\n The like order was observed in taking away the dishes, and each man\r\n knew his service and his place and did nought else. The dishes were\r\n according to the tables, and among those who brought them in were the\r\n stewards, each of whom directed his own men to the proper table. There\r\n were fifty large dishes, the contents of each of which were sufficient\r\n to fill two trenchers, and one trencher was placed between every two\r\n guests, a carver being in attendance.\r\n\r\n The banquets were prepared for a marriage rather than for a\r\n magnificent feast, and I think this was done _de industria_ as an\r\n example to others not to exceed the modesty and simplicity suitable\r\n to marriages, so there was never more than one roast. In the morning\r\n a small dish, then some boiled meat, then a roast, after that wafers,\r\n marzipan and sugared almonds and pine-seeds, then jars of preserved\r\n pine-seeds and sweetmeats. In the evening jelly, a roast, fritters,\r\n wafers, almonds, and jars of sweetmeats. On Tuesday morning, instead\r\n of the roast were sweet pies of succulent vegetables on trenchers; the\r\n wines were excellent malvasy, trebbiano,[132] and red wine. Of silver\r\n plate there was little.\r\n\r\n No sideboards had been placed for the silver. Only tall tables in the\r\n middle of the courtyard, round that handsome column on which stands\r\n the David,[133] covered with tablecloths, and at the four corners were\r\n four great copper basins for the glasses, and behind the tables stood\r\n men to hand wine or water to those who served the guests. The same\r\n arrangement was made in the garden round the fountain you know. On the\r\n tables were silver vessels in which the glasses were put to be kept\r\n cool. The salt-cellars, forks, knife-handles, bowls for the fritters,\r\n almonds, sugar-plums, and the jars for preserved pine-seeds were of\r\n silver; there was none other for the guests save the basins and jugs\r\n for washing of hands. The tablecloths were of the finest white damask\r\n linen[134] laid according to our fashion.\r\n\r\n About four hundred citizens were invited to these five banquets, and\r\n among them the first of your house was your Lorenzo, and then Agnolo\r\n and Lodovico; I was also there.\r\n\r\n On Monday morning to all who had received veal, jelly was given,\r\n and then about 1500 trenchers full were presented to others. Many\r\n religious [monks and nuns] also received gifts of fowls, fish,\r\n sweetmeats, wine, and similar things.\r\n\r\n After the guests at the first tables had finished many hundreds ate.\r\n They say that between the house here and that of Messer Carlo[135]\r\n more than a thousand people ate, and at Messer Carlo’s every day one\r\n hundred barrels of wine were drunk.\r\n\r\n In the house here, where the marriage feast was, every respectable\r\n person who came in was at once taken to the ground-floor hall, out of\r\n the large loggia, to refresh himself with fruit, sweetmeats, and white\r\n and red wine. The common folk were not invited.\r\n\r\n The feasting began in the morning a little before dinner-time, then\r\n every one went away to repose. At about the twentieth hour (4 o’clock)\r\n they returned and danced until supper-time on the stage outside, which\r\n was decorated with tapestries, benches, and forms, and covered in with\r\n large curtains of purple, green, and white cloth, embroidered with\r\n the arms of the Medici and the Orsini. Every time a company came on\r\n to the stage to dance they took refreshments once or twice, according\r\n to the time. First came the trumpeters, then a great silver basin,\r\n then many smaller ones full of glasses, then small silver jars full\r\n of water, then many flasks of trebbiano and then twenty-three silver\r\n bowls full of preserved pine-seeds and sweet conserves. To all was\r\n given in abundance and all the dishes were emptied; and the same with\r\n the flasks of wine. The account has not been made, but from five to\r\n ... thousand pounds of sweetmeats and sugar-plums were consumed.\r\n\r\n The bride has received about fifty rings, costing they say from ten to\r\n fifty or sixty ducats each; one piece of brocade; a sweetmeat dish of\r\n silver, and many other such things; and a small book of the offices\r\n of Our Lady, most beautiful, the gift of Messer Gentile,[136] written\r\n in letters of gold on blue vellum and covered with crystal and worked\r\n silver, which cost about two hundred florins. On Tuesday the bride\r\n left (a tournament was held first), and returned to the house of the\r\n Alessandri in the same dress in which she came to be married. This\r\n was a robe of white and gold brocade and a magnificent hood on her\r\n head, as is used here. She rode the same horse and was accompanied\r\n by the same youths, whose rich dresses of silver brocade embroidered\r\n with large pearls and jewels baffle description. From what they tell\r\n of courts of great princes nothing was ever seen like it save certain\r\n jewels of great value worn by some great Lords. Of the women I say\r\n nothing! Such jackets and robes of silk, all of them embroidered with\r\n pearls. I rather blame than praise this height of civilisation. And\r\n thus ended this marriage.\r\n\r\n One day it rained; on the Monday, just when the feast was at its\r\n highest. It seemed as though done on purpose. It enveloped everything\r\n and wet the beautiful dresses, for the rain was so sudden and so heavy\r\n that many could not get under shelter soon enough. But the youths and\r\n the women had not put on the finest clothes which they had reserved\r\n for that day, the most important of the feast, so that to many it\r\n seemed their money had been spent in vain, not being able to wear\r\n them. However, on Tuesday morning when the bride went to hear mass in\r\n S. Lorenzo, accompanied by all the youths and maidens who had attended\r\n her at the wedding, every one was in their finest clothes. I warrant\r\n you that there were about fifty maidens and young girls and as many or\r\n more youths, so richly dressed that I do not think that anywhere among\r\n so many people could such a splendid and fine spectacle be seen.\r\n\r\n I know that though I have written you many things and in much detail\r\n there is much still to be said; and although it is not worth your\r\n reading or my writing, yet I have done so for your information, as I\r\n know you to be curious, and that you like to know exactly how things\r\n went. So I have written thus thinking it would please you better than\r\n a more serious style.[137]\r\n\r\n\r\nRinaldo Orsini _to his sister_ Clarice de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Magnificent sister, _salutem_. From Messer Giovanni [Tornabuoni] we\r\n have heard all the excellent news about your family, so that we are\r\n most happy and contented, and could have received no better news. We\r\n all beg and advise you to conduct yourself in such manner with every\r\n one that you will become even dearer to Piero, Lorenzo, Giuliano,\r\n Madonna Contessina, and Madonna Lucrezia, and to your sisters-in-law,\r\n and generally to all relations and other persons you meet. If we can\r\n do anything here for Lorenzo or any of your family offer me to them,\r\n for nothing shall be left undone to fulfil any desire of theirs. Also\r\n if there is aught you wish done tell me, and I shall show that I hold\r\n you as dear as I do Organtino, who, as a male, and careful of the\r\n interests of our house, I love as I do my own life. Commend me to the\r\n Magnificent Piero and the ladies, and salute Lorenzo and Giuliano from\r\n me. _Item_ it is necessary that Messer Baptista da Augubio [Gubbio]\r\n should go to Florence, you know how devoted he is to us; if needs be\r\n ask Piero and Lorenzo, for love of us, to favour him.--Rome, June 1469.\r\n\r\n                                               Rainaldus de Orsini.[138]\r\n\r\n\r\nGiovanni di Bentivogli _from Bologna to_ Piero de’ Medici _at Florence_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice et Prestantissime Pater honorande_,--I have not written\r\n to Your Magnificence in these last days about the affair at Rimini,\r\n because I was sure you would hear of it from diverse sides, and that\r\n the Illustrious League would take proper steps. But as I neither see\r\n nor hear that the Illustrious League has made any sign of life and\r\n considering the great injury to us, to the friends of the League, and\r\n to yourself, which will be occasioned in the future, I am moved to\r\n note it and to impart my thoughts to Your Magnificence; although I\r\n do not esteem myself of sufficient capacity to write such notes. But\r\n anxiety, and devotion to the Illustrious League, and the love I bear\r\n Your Magnificence induce me to warn you. I have also written this my\r\n opinion to H.E. the Duke, and should have done the same to H.M. the\r\n King, only the road is long and our messengers pass with difficulty;\r\n also I thought Your Magnificence would have sent the news from there.\r\n Your Magnificence must have heard that the Signoria of Venice has\r\n again made an alliance with our Lord the Pope, _et inter alia_ has\r\n promised to send, whenever he demands them, 4000 horse and 3000\r\n foot-soldiers into Romagna. From good authority I hear that the Pope\r\n has just asked for them, and that the Signoria is arming them and has\r\n ordered His Magnificence Ercole [Duke of Ferrara], the Lords of Carpi\r\n and of Mirandola, to hold themselves in readiness to march; and that\r\n yesterday they were to receive their pay. Also I hear that bridges\r\n are being thrown across the Po near Ravenna, for the passage of the\r\n troops of the Signoria of Venice, and that the picked squadrons and\r\n Antonello da la Corna were advancing to meet these others. What all\r\n these preparations mean I leave to the judgment of Your Magnificence.\r\n I can only imagine that the Pope and the Signoria of Venice intend to\r\n occupy Arimino and the rest of Romagna and then Bologna. Should Rimini\r\n fall this will probably happen, and where Bologna and Imola would be\r\n Your Magnificence and the League may, like prudent men, calculate.\r\n He who does not put a stop to such beginnings will spend a hundred\r\n instead of one, and God grant things may go well. I therefore beg and\r\n entreat Your Magnificence to succour little Arimino in order that the\r\n wound may not fester and increase in such wise that none can heal it.\r\n The Illustrious League must not allow its friends to lose courage and\r\n faith, else the end will be our perdition. To me it seems this is not\r\n a moment for losing time. Your Magnificence must remember that the\r\n Pope and the Signoria of Venice have been preparing this for a long\r\n time, otherwise the Pope would not have spent so much money, a thing\r\n quite against his nature. Had the move been only against Arimino;\r\n but it is more especially against Bologna and the rest of Romagna,\r\n and more considerable events may follow. I commend myself to Your\r\n Magnificence.--June 17, 1469.\r\n\r\n                                            Johannes di Bentivolis.[139]\r\n\r\nA few weeks after his wedding Lorenzo had to leave his bride and\r\nundertake an embassy to Milan. A son had been born on June 20th to\r\nGaleazzo, Duke of Milan, and Piero de’ Medici was asked to stand\r\nsponsor to the child. He was too ill to travel, and “somewhat\r\nunwillingly,” he confesses, sent Lorenzo to act as his proxy. The\r\nembassy went by Prato, Pistoja, Lucca, and Pietrasanta to Sarzana,\r\nwhich town and district had been recently purchased by Pietro and\r\nadded to the Florentine dominions. Thence the company travelled by\r\nPontremoli to Milan. The preparations for the journey were evidently\r\non too magnificent a scale to please the cautious father, and we find\r\nhim complaining to his wife Lucrezia in a less affectionate tone than\r\nusual. The following three letters refer to the journey. To it also\r\nbelongs the passage in Lorenzo’s _Ricordi_ or memoranda, in which he\r\nstates that Sforza proposed that he should stand godfather to all his\r\nother children.\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici _at Careggi to_ Lucrezia _his wife in Florence_\r\n\r\n Thou knowest how unwilling I was for many reasons, particularly in\r\n order not to give any importance to this mission, to allow Lorenzo\r\n to go. Yesterday we agreed about this, but I have not heard what\r\n thou hast done; it has been much talked about, which displeases me.\r\n Herewith I repeat that they must be here this evening and start\r\n _infallanter_ to-morrow morning. If they do not, I shall arrange in\r\n some other way. Meanwhile see that everything is ready, and tell\r\n Lorenzo that he is not to exceed his orders, or to make any great\r\n show;[140] he is not an ambassador. I am determined that the gosling\r\n shall not lead the gander to drink. Make haste, for thou must return\r\n here without fail this evening. No more.--Careggi, July 13, 1469.\r\n\r\n                                                   Piero di Cosimo.[141]\r\n\r\n\r\nGentile Becchi _to_ Clarice de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifica Domina_, &c.\r\n\r\n Your Magnificence commanded me to send you news of your Magnificent\r\n Lorenzo every eight days. I now begin to recount the first week. As\r\n you will have heard from Francesco Nori and Gugliemo de’ Pazzi, after\r\n leaving you in the early morning we arrived at Prato during the cool.\r\n He dined with the Protonotary of the Medici, together with the Podestà\r\n of the place, his own people and Giuliano. There was some wind when we\r\n left about the 20th hour [4 P.M.], and he reached Pistoja on Friday\r\n evening, being met by several citizens of the town. He dismounted at\r\n the Bishop’s palace, as a messenger had said that Monsignore expected\r\n him. Having saluted the Bishop he went, while the luggage was being\r\n unloaded, to visit the two governors (_Rettori_), the Captain and\r\n the Podestà of the town, who were all invited by the Bishop to keep\r\n him company at supper. Four citizens came on behalf of the Priors to\r\n excuse themselves in the name of the townspeople, that on account of\r\n his unexpected arrival they had not, &c. &c., and begged him with\r\n affectionate words that on his return, &c. On Saturday he mounted at\r\n nine in the morning, and dined at Pescia with the governor, Baptista\r\n Nasi, there being no better inn; the heads of the Commune came to\r\n pay their respects, and presented wine, marzipan (cakes made with\r\n sweet almonds), and corn, and some private citizens did the same.\r\n After resting in the house of the Grand Master of Altopascio, who\r\n had accompanied him for dinner, he left at 20 of the clock, and met\r\n several chief citizens who had come to do him honour in their houses.\r\n Passing through Lucca at 23 of the clock, he dismounted at the inn\r\n della Corona,[142] outside the town on the Pisan road, intending to\r\n leave the next morning (Sunday). But after supper came six citizens of\r\n Lucca, with torches and servants of the Signoria, and finding Lorenzo\r\n on the square in the cool receiving visits from private acquaintances\r\n Paolo Trenta and Piero Guidiccioni addressed him, complaining that he\r\n had not deigned to dismount in a city where he was so welcome and had\r\n such influence, but had gone outside, and then in a long oration they\r\n prayed him to wait until the Signoria had, &c. &c. Lorenzo replied\r\n that to see them, whom he reverenced as fathers, gave him patience to\r\n undertake these visits, and perceiving that he was expected to reply\r\n in person he would put off his departure until after dinner, and next\r\n morning would come and demonstrate his affection towards the Signoria.\r\n Messer Niccolò da Noceto, Paolo di Poggio, and many other citizens\r\n came on Sunday morning to fetch him, and placing him first in their\r\n midst, and then Bernardo Rucellai, and then the Chancellor, they\r\n accompanied him to mass in the chapel of the Volto Santo, and then to\r\n the Signoria, where he spoke so fluently and so well that he drew to\r\n himself the hearts of all the people. When he returned presents began\r\n to arrive, torches, large and small, marzipan, boxes of sweetmeats,\r\n and wine. He thanked, bestowed gifts, kept a few of the gentlemen\r\n to dinner, spread out his silver, and as some showed symptoms of\r\n moving the wind having risen, he left before the time fixed; yet\r\n many of the citizens rode after him, and insisted on accompanying\r\n him and talking much. On the way he rested at Chiesa, Mazzarosa, and\r\n Capezzano, all very pretty places. At Pietrasanta he arrived at 23 of\r\n the clock, and lodged at the inn of the Campana outside, for it is an\r\n untrustworthy town; S. George had not much faith in S. Zita.[143] But\r\n the governor, who is a gentleman from Fiesco, sent to offer to pay his\r\n respects, and to do anything in his power. He saw him, thanked, and\r\n then, accompanied by all those men who could not take their eyes off\r\n him, supped with some of the citizens under an arbour; the place is\r\n beautiful with the sea in front and fertile plains behind. At 8 of\r\n the clock he mounted and rode sixteen miles most gaily. Under Monte\r\n Tignoso he met an envoy of the Magnificent Marquess of Fosdinovo, who\r\n invited him in the name of his master, and at Lavenza, or a little\r\n before reaching Luni, the Marquess Gabriello himself, who conducted\r\n him to his house at Sarzana. On dismounting he visited the governor\r\n who rules here for the Florentines, then we dined, and after resting\r\n a little went to see Sarzanella, which seen from the castle seemed to\r\n him a good purchase.[144] When he had supped he went to visit Messer\r\n Francesco, ducal Cameriere, who lives out of the town, and finding\r\n him ill provided for supper, he supplied him bountifully. To-morrow\r\n he goes to dine at Villa Franca, and in the evening will be at\r\n Pontremoli. The journey has been so arranged that he will be at Milan\r\n on Saturday, and after fulfilling his Magnificent father’s commission\r\n he will return at once to you who are the only one he regrets being\r\n absent from. He is very well and gay, and so is Bernardo.[145] Tell\r\n Nannina this. Our party is as when we left all good friends and\r\n obedient; we have had no drawbacks, for not even a nail is wanting. We\r\n have had no delays or frauds. All goes well and happily: please God we\r\n shall find you the same, to whom we all commend ourselves.--The 18th\r\n day of July 1469.[146]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to his wife_ Clarice\r\n\r\n I have arrived here safely and am well. I am sure this will please\r\n thee more than any other news save that of my return, judging by my\r\n own feelings of longing for thee and for home. Make much of Piero,\r\n Mona Contessina, and Mona Lucrezia; I shall hasten to finish here and\r\n return to thee, for it seems to me a thousand years since I saw thee.\r\n Pray to God for me, and if thou wantest aught from here let me know,\r\n so be I have not already left Milan.--July 22, 1469.\r\n\r\n                                            Thy Lorenzo de’ Medici.[147]\r\n\r\nIn Lorenzo’s _Ricordi_ he writes: “In the month of July MCDLXIX I went\r\nto Milan at the request of the most illustrious Duke Galeazzo to stand\r\ngodfather, as proxy for Piero our father, to his first-born child. I\r\nwas received with much honour, more so than the others who came for\r\nthe same purpose, although they were persons more worthy than I. We\r\npaid our duty to the Duchess by presenting her with a necklace of gold\r\nwith a large diamond, which cost near 2000 ducats. The consequence was\r\nthat the said Lord desired that I should stand godfather to all his\r\nchildren.”[148]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici, _from Monza_, _to his father_ Piero _in Florence_\r\n\r\n Being here at Monza with His Excellency, he wishes me to write to you\r\n about sending aid to Arimino, and begs you to arrange that Signor\r\n Roberto [Malatesta] with his troop should join the Duke of Urbino. As\r\n I know that Messer Luigi is writing fully about this I say no more,\r\n and all being in his hands I should not have mentioned it but for His\r\n Lordship’s orders. You will see what I write to Sagromora about being\r\n careful of your own person, so that nothing unforeseen should happen.\r\n It is well to give ear to all, though I do not think the danger is as\r\n great as it seems. Still it is better to be prudent, and to imagine\r\n danger may be greater than it really is.\r\n\r\n I have taken leave of His Excellency, and this evening go to Milan,\r\n where I shall spend all to-morrow. On Monday, if it pleases God, I\r\n leave by way of Genoa, as after talking to His Lordship he thought it\r\n a good plan. I expect to stay two or three days in Genoa and to be\r\n with you on the 13th or at the latest the 14th of August. Meanwhile I\r\n commend myself to you.--Moncia [Monza], July 28, 1469.\r\n\r\n                                                      Your Lorenzo.[149]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1469 Piero de’ Medici was very ill, partly no doubt\r\nfrom anxiety about the state of Florence, “grievously troubled by\r\nher own citizens.” He summoned the chief burghers to his bedside,\r\nreproached them in the bitter words cited by Machiavelli, and\r\nthreatened that he would cause them to repent. Fair words in plenty\r\nthey gave him, but never changed their evil courses. “Whereupon,”\r\ncontinues Machiavelli, “Piero called Agnolo Acciaiuoli secretly to\r\nCaffagiuolo and conferred at length with him about the condition of\r\nthe city. There is no doubt that had he not been prevented by death he\r\nwould have reinstated all those who had been banished in order to put a\r\nstop to the robbery of the others. But death put an end to these most\r\npraiseworthy intentions. Tormented by increasing infirmity and anguish\r\nof mind, he died in the fifty-third year of his age. His country could\r\nnot fully recognise his worth and his goodness, because until nearly\r\nthe end of his life he was associated with his father Cosimo, and the\r\nfew years during which he survived him were passed in civil contests\r\nand constant illness.” Piero died at Careggi on December 2, 1469, and\r\nwas buried in S. Lorenzo, near his father.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORENZO DI PIERO DE’ MEDICI.\r\n\r\n_In the Museo Giovio (Villa Soave, Como)._]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[87] _Delle Istorie Fiorentine_, Niccolò Machiavelli, pp. 410 _et seq._\r\nMilano, 1823.\r\n\r\n[88] _Cosmi Vita_, op. cit. ii. 286.\r\n\r\n[89] This document is undated, but was in all probability given in 1464.\r\n\r\n[90] _Laurentii Medicis Magnifici Vita_, Angelo Fabronio, ii. 117.\r\nPisis, 1784.\r\n\r\n[91] Palatina Codex 204.

The famous letter begins on page 71 (really 142, as only the\r\nright-hand page is numbered) and above it is written in a different and\r\nmore modern hand in red ink, _Epistola di M.

At page 78 (_i.e._ 156) the handwriting changes,\r\nand at the end of the volume is inserted a Latin autograph letter from\r\nPoliziano to Philippu Beroaldus. In 1814 the Abbate Vincenzo Nannucci\r\nand Luigi Ciampolini published a collection of Poliziano’s poems and\r\nat the end printed Lorenzo’s letter, attributing it to Poliziano. They\r\nwere evidently misled by the anonymous annotator of this codex. The\r\nattribution to Poliziano is absurd, as he was then barely fourteen\r\nyears of age, and only knew Lorenzo in 1470, when he sent him a\r\ntranslation of part of the Iliad (see p. 157).\r\n\r\n[93] _Renaissance in Italy_, J.

His brothers Luca and Bernardo were also\r\npoets. and Bernardo’s wife Antonia was a poetess of some repute. Luca\r\nwent into trade but failed, and died in gaol in 1470, leaving his widow\r\nand children dependent on his brothers. Luigi, an intimate friend of\r\nthe Medici family, wrote _La Giostra_ (sometimes attributed to his\r\nbrother Luca) to celebrate the tournament held by Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\nin honour of the marriage of Braccio Martelli, but really of Lucrezia\r\nDonati just before his marriage with Clarice Orsini. The poem _Driades_\r\nwas first published under the pseudonym of Lucio Pulcro in Florence in\r\n1479, but the later editions bear his name. His greatest work, less\r\nread than it deserves, _Morgante Maggiore_, was, as Mr. Armstrong says,\r\na growth rather than a composition. Stanzas were recited at table,\r\nand Lucrezia de’ Medici urged him to collect them into an epic poem.\r\nBesides being a poet, Luigi Pulci was an acute and clever politician,\r\noften employed by Lorenzo in missions to foreign courts. He died in\r\n1484, probably at Padua whilst on the road to Venice.\r\n\r\n[103] _Lettere di Luigi Pulci a Lorenzo il Magnifico_, Nelle Nozze\r\ndella Volpe Zambrini, p. 6.

No. 411.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORENZO DI PIERO DE’ MEDICI\r\n\r\n(1450-1492)\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici, whose wonderful personality still has the power\r\nto excite bitter hatred and an almost passionate admiration, was\r\na marvellously many-sided man. Marsilio Ficino said he possessed\r\nthe three endowments called “graces” by Orpheus, splendour,\r\nlight-heartedness, and rejuvenescence--splendour of intellect,\r\nlight-heartedness in resolution, and a continual renewal of youth in\r\nperson and in fortune. He was not twenty-one when his father died,\r\nworn out by bodily suffering, but Lorenzo had been his right hand for\r\nyears, had been sent to represent him at foreign courts, and had seen\r\nmore of the world than most men of double his age. He and his younger\r\nbrother Giuliano received the education of princes rather than of the\r\nsons of a merchant. Gentile Becchi of Urbino, a man of unblemished\r\nlife and considerable learning, was their tutor, Landino taught them\r\nItalian literature, Argyropoulos Greek, and Marsilio Ficino Platonic\r\nphilosophy. They had also evidently been taught good manners, as Cambi,\r\nwho never misses an opportunity to decry the Medici, tells us that when\r\nLorenzo was with a citizen older than himself he always gave him the\r\nplace of honour on his right. Above all, the two lads had the example\r\nand the teaching of their mother Lucrezia, a woman of strong good sense\r\nand genuine piety, who possessed a sunny nature, that rare gift humour,\r\nand a marked poetical temperament. From early childhood she sent\r\nLorenzo to the meetings of the confraternity of S. Paolo, where men\r\nmet for vigil and prayer, and after the services Messer Gentile by her\r\norders made him distribute alms to the poor. When the boy was thirteen\r\nGentile wrote to his father: “Lorenzo is well, your absence is ever\r\nbefore him. We are well advanced in Ovid and also in Justinian, four\r\nbooks of history and fables. You need not ask how he delights in these\r\nstudies. His conduct is excellent, and he is very obedient.”\r\n\r\nAfter Piero’s death Lucrezia, who had always been her husband’s trusted\r\nhelpmate, became the counsellor to whom Lorenzo turned for help,\r\nconsolation, and advice. He also had the good fortune to have a wise\r\nand capable man by his side, Tommaso Soderini, husband of his mother’s\r\nsister, Dianora Tornabuoni. Soderini’s influence was considerable, and\r\nhe used it to induce his fellow-citizens to confirm Lorenzo in the\r\npre-eminent though entirely unofficial position held by his grandfather\r\nand his father. There was hardly a dissentient voice when the chief\r\ncitizens of Florence came to the Medici palace and begged him to take\r\ncharge of the city as they had done.\r\n\r\nNiccolò Valori describes Lorenzo as “above the common stature, with\r\nbroad shoulders, solidly built, robust, and second to none in agility.\r\nAlthough nature had acted towards him like a stepmother with regard\r\nto his personal appearance, in all things connected with the mind she\r\nhad been a loving mother. His complexion was swarthy, and although\r\nhis face was not handsome, it was so full of dignity as to command\r\nrespect. He was short-sighted, his nose was flattened, and he had no\r\nsense of smell. This did not trouble him. He was wont to say that he\r\nwas grateful to nature, disagreeable things being more common than\r\nagreeable ones to so delicate a sense.”\r\n\r\nLorenzo was much inferior to his grandfather Cosimo in commercial\r\ntalent, but he was a genius, and as Symonds writes, “possessed of\r\none of those rare natures, fitted to comprehend all knowledge and to\r\nsympathise with the most diverse forms of life. While he never for a\r\nmoment relaxed his hold on politics, among philosophers he passed as\r\na sage, among men of letters for an original and graceful poet, among\r\nscholars for a Grecian, sensitive to every nicety of Attic idiom, among\r\nartists for an amateur gifted with refined discernment and consummate\r\ntaste. Pleasure-seekers knew in him the libertine, who jousted with the\r\nboldest, danced and masqueraded with the merriest, sought adventures in\r\nthe streets at night, and joined the people in their May-day games and\r\nCarnival festivities. The pious extolled him as an author of devotional\r\nlauds and mystery plays, a profound theologian, a critic of sermons.\r\nHe was no less famous for his jokes and repartees than for his pithy\r\napothegms and maxims, as good a judge of cattle as of statues, as much\r\nat home in the bosom of his family as in the riot of an orgy, as ready\r\nto discourse on Plato as to plan a campaign or to plot the death of a\r\ndangerous citizen.”[150]\r\n\r\nA philosopher, a diplomatist, a “Pagan much inclined to the worship of\r\nVenus,” as Machiavelli tells us, a Christian as shown in his _Laudi_\r\nand his _Capitoli_, evidently written _con amore_, a staunch friend,\r\ngenerous and kind, yet he is generally accused of having ordered the\r\nsack of Volterra--now, however, proved to have been instigated by the\r\nmercenaries engaged to defend the town--and of causing his opponents to\r\nbe tortured and executed. The indelible stain on Lorenzo’s fair name is\r\nhis interference with the deposits in the _Monte_.[151] Cambi, who it\r\nmust be remembered was no friend of the Medici, writes: “On the 13th\r\nAugust 1490 seventeen so-called Reformers were created by the authority\r\nof the Signory, the Colleges of the Council, of the People, and of the\r\nCommune, the Council of the One Hundred, the officers of the _Monte_,\r\nand the whole _Popolo_ of Florence. Under pretext of revising the\r\ncoinage and the duties they altered the entries of all monies received\r\nfor the use of the State for the benefit of Lorenzo de’ Medici, who\r\nneeded money in order to make his son Messer Giovanni a cardinal, which\r\nhe did. And it was done with the money of the Commune. Counting what\r\nthey gave him after he became a cardinal, it cost the Commune 10,000\r\nscudi in gold. From the poor dowers of the married maidens and of those\r\nabout to be married they deducted by means of taxes and the reduction\r\nof all future interest 3/4 per cent. of the interest, so that what\r\nshould have given 3 per cent. they lowered to 1-1/2 per cent., and even\r\nthat was not paid.... Thus few maidens married, and those few only\r\nby dint of money. Even then the permission of Lorenzo de’ Medici was\r\nnecessary. Let every one therefore consider what it means to create\r\ntyrants in the city, to make a Balia and to call a parliament.”[152]\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for the Italian language that the young Lorenzo fell\r\nunder the influence of Leon Battista Alberti, who asserted that “though\r\nthe ancient tongue has undisputed authority because so many learned\r\nmen have employed it, the like honour will certainly be paid to our\r\nlanguage to-day if men of culture take the pains to purify and polish\r\nit.” The revival of classical learning had almost arrested the study\r\nof Italian. In spite of the example of Dante and Boccaccio, Latin was\r\nthe patrician and literary language, and even when men of letters used\r\nthe vulgar tongue they interlarded it with Latin. Poliziano’s letters\r\nare a case in point. The example of Lorenzo altered all this. In his\r\nletter to Federigo of Naples (p. 88) he passes extraordinarily acute\r\ncriticism on the old Italian poets, and in his Commentary, which takes\r\nup ninety-three double pages in the Aldine edition of his poems, he\r\npredicts a glorious future to the language used by Dante, Cavalcanti,\r\nPetrarch, and Boccaccio. “Men and practice,” he says, “have rather\r\nbeen wanting to the language than the language to the men.” Muratori,\r\ntreating of the poetry of the fifteenth century, gives the palm to\r\nLorenzo, and Carducci declares him to be little if at all inferior to\r\nPoliziano and Pulci.\r\n\r\nIncessantly occupied in preserving the balance of power in Italy, yet\r\nin his short life of forty-two years he wrote an amount of poetry,\r\nand good poetry, which would do credit to a man whose whole life is\r\ndedicated to literature. Treated as an equal by popes and princes--the\r\nKing of France doffed his cap to his ambassadors and called him “my\r\nbeloved cousin”--he was at home with the artisan and the peasant,\r\nwhose tastes he to a certain degree shared, and whose characters he\r\nso perfectly understood and describes. In _La Nencia da Barberino_,\r\nthat gayest of gay poems overflowing with _la joie de vivre_, often\r\nimitated but never surpassed, Vallera, the shy love-sick peasant, sings\r\nthe praises of his Nencia, who, with her pretty ways and soft words,\r\nher eyes as black as coal, and her fair curly hair, would bear away\r\nthe palm among a thousand city maidens. Such a dancer too. She bounds\r\nlike a young goat, whirls like the wheel of a mill and then curtsies,\r\nno Florentine lady can do it better. He offers to buy her a paper\r\ncornet full of rouge or powder, or pins, or a necklace of those little\r\nred buttons [coral] when he goes to Florence, for he would draw the\r\nmarrow from his bones to give her pleasure. Could he put his heart\r\ninto her hands it would cry “_Nencia, Nencia bella_,” if she cut it\r\nwith a knife. But Nencia flirts with other swains, his sighs are full\r\nof tears, he waits for her to come with her sheep when he drives his\r\nheifers to pasture, and the cruel girl turns back.[153]\r\n\r\nLorenzo’s love of the country, of country life, and of animals,\r\nis shown in _Ambra_ and _La Caccia col Falcone_. The former is an\r\nallegorical description of a flood which swept away an island at\r\nLorenzo’s favourite villa, Poggio a Caiano. Winter is approaching. Only\r\nthe bay, the myrtle, and the prickly juniper, shine among the bare\r\ntrees, while the few birds take refuge in the cypresses. The olives\r\non a southern slope sway, now green now silver white, to the breeze.\r\nThe cranes print varied and beautiful lines on the sky, and Lorenzo\r\nnotes how the leader cedes his place, when tired, to one of those in\r\nthe rear. The eagle slowly circles in the air, a menace to all smaller\r\nfowl. Zephyr has fled to Cyprus, where he dances with the lazy flowers\r\namong the green grass. Boreas drives the mists down from the Alps,\r\nand the river, writhing like a serpent in the valley, gathers his\r\ntributaries. With strange sounds he rises. The yellow foam is tossed\r\ninto the air as the wicked turbid stream rolls stone upon stone, and\r\ndashing against the dykes, overwhelms Ambra, “beloved of Lorenzo.”\r\nThe terrified peasants take refuge on the roofs of their cottages,\r\nand watch their poor riches being swept away. Then comes the more\r\nartificial and well-worn tale of the lovely nymph Ambra pursued by the\r\nriver god Ombrone, her prayer to the chaste goddess, and her farewell\r\nto Lorenzo as she is turned to stone.\r\n\r\n_La Caccia col Falcone_ is a graphic account of the sport Lorenzo\r\nloved. Falcons, dogs, and men are drawn with facile pen by a man who\r\ndelighted in country life and open air.\r\n\r\n_Selve d’Amore_ is a lover’s complaint on the absence of his lady.\r\nJealousy, Hope, and the Age of Gold, which existed before the opening\r\nof Pandora’s box, are described. He invokes his mistress in these\r\nbeautiful lines beginning:\r\n\r\n    “O vaghi occhi amorosi,”\r\n\r\nand at last she appears, Beauty on her right hand, Love on her left.\r\n\r\nThis is, however, not the place to describe Lorenzo’s poems, the fine\r\n_Altercazione_, a Platonic dialogue; the _Capitoli_, or _I Beoni_. His\r\n_Ballate_, _Canzone di Ballo_, and _Canzone Carnescialeschi_, which\r\nrepresent the popular, often very licentious poetry of the streets, are\r\nknown to all Italian scholars. Il Lasca (A. Grazzini), after describing\r\nthe masqueraders parading the streets with _Trionfi_, allegorical or\r\nmythological cars, and _Carri_ filled with men representing various\r\ntrades, each one preceded and followed by its special attendants\r\nsinging and dancing, and many masqued horsemen, says: “The Magnificent\r\nLorenzo invented this manner of celebrating the festival. Formerly\r\nmen dressed up as women went about the streets singing and dancing,\r\nimitating the maidens who thus greeted the month of May. The\r\nMagnificent, finding it was always the same thing, imagined to change\r\nnot only the songs but the whole representation and the words, writing\r\nsongs with varied metres, and causing new and different airs to be\r\nwritten. The first of these masquerades was performed by men who sold\r\nsugar-plums and _berriquocoli_ (small cakes), and the music, for three\r\nvoices, was written by a certain Arrigo Tedesco,[154] head of the choir\r\nof S. Giovanni, a musician of great repute in those days.”\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful of Lorenzo’s carnival songs is _Il Trionfo di Bacco\r\ne Arianne_, beginning:\r\n\r\n    “Quant’ è bella giovanezza\r\n    Che si fugge tuttavia.”\r\n\r\nLorenzo’s sonnets are many, and some are worthy to rank with those of\r\nthe most famous poets; indeed Muratori, in the specimens of perfect\r\npoetry appended to his treatise, cites four of them, together with\r\nthe finest of Dante, Cavalcanti, Petrarch, and other great poets. In\r\nthe _Laudi_, and the sacred play _S. Giovanni e Paolo_, can be traced\r\nLorenzo’s early bringing up under his mother, herself no mean poetess,\r\nand the good Bishop Gentile. The play was written in later life for his\r\nchildren who acted it. It is said that Lorenzo himself took the part\r\nof Constantine. Already ill, and oppressed with cares, the Emperor’s\r\naddress to his sons describing the duties of a ruler, and the lines\r\n\r\n    “Spesso chi chiama Costantin felice\r\n    Sta meglio assai di me e’l ver non dice,”\r\n\r\nhave a sad autobiographical ring.\r\n\r\nLorenzo, the one great statesman of Italy, had no easy part to play.\r\nAs prudent as he was dexterous, the preservation of peace in Italy\r\nwas his constant aim, to be attained by a maintenance of the balance\r\nof power so that no one State should become pre-eminent. His violent\r\nand unscrupulous enemy Sixtus IV. used every arm against him. When\r\nassassination failed he tried excommunication, and the laying of\r\nFlorence under an interdict. The Florentines answered by appointing\r\ntwelve citizens as a bodyguard to Lorenzo, and bidding the clergy to\r\ncelebrate the sacraments. His sagacity, not only as a Tuscan but an\r\nItalian, was shown by the able way in which he traversed French schemes\r\nfor interfering in Italy, although the fortune of his house was largely\r\ndependent on the well-being of the bank at Lyons. So quietly and\r\nunostentatiously was this done that French ambassadors were instructed\r\nto act according to his advice, and he became the intermediary between\r\nRome and Paris.[155] “Lorenzo,” writes Dr. Creighton, “had striven\r\nto identify the Medici family with Florence, and had been himself\r\nthe representative and expression of the desires and aspirations of\r\nFlorentine life and culture. He had also learned that the existence\r\nof Italy depended upon the maintenance of internal peace, and his\r\nefforts for that end had, for the last ten years of his life, been\r\nunceasing. His early experience had taught him how difficult was the\r\nposition which he had to maintain, that of chief citizen of a free\r\ncity, whose fortunes and whose very existence depended on exercising\r\nabsolute power without seeming to do so. It is easy to accuse him of\r\ninsidiously destroying Florentine liberty; but the policy of Sixtus IV.\r\nleft him no choice between such a course and retirement from Florence,\r\nand he may be pardoned if he doubted whether his abdication would\r\nconduce to the welfare of the city. He has been accused of abetting the\r\nmoral enervation and corruption of his people; but the causes of this\r\ncorruption are to be found in the general character of Italian life,\r\nand Lorenzo did no more than follow the prevailing fashion in lending\r\nhis refinement to give expression to the popular taste. Lorenzo did\r\nwhat all Italian statesmen were doing; he identified his city for good\r\nand ill with his own house. He worked craftily and insidiously, not by\r\nopen violence, and in the midst of his self-seeking he retained the\r\nlarge views of a statesman and embodied the culture of his age.”[156]\r\n\r\nThe Marquess Gino Capponi in his History of Florence writes: “The\r\nMedici palace was a museum, a school, and a place of meeting for all\r\nthe learned men who flocked thither, from it proceeded grave counsel\r\nand intellectual teaching as well as shows and festivals, and a general\r\ncorruption of manners. Two popes passed their childhood there, and the\r\nPlatonic Academy, intended to raise the standard of life and thought,\r\nwas founded within its walls. Poliziano and Pico della Mirandola, one\r\nof the greatest men of his time, were constant visitors. There the\r\nfirst chips flew off the marble under the chisel of Michelangelo, and\r\nthere Luigi Pulci read the Morgante aloud. Such exuberance of life,\r\nsuch magnificence, such gaiety, has probably never been witnessed in\r\nany other age, and the name of Lorenzo towers above it all.”[157]\r\n\r\n\r\nRicordi of Lorenzo the Magnificent, son of Piero di Cosimo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n A brief narrative of the course of my life and of some other important\r\n things worthy of remembrance for the guidance and information of\r\n those who will succeed me, and especially for my sons. Begun this day,\r\n the 15th March 1472.\r\n\r\n I find from the books of Piero our father that I was born on January\r\n 1, 1449 [1450]. By our mother Maria Lucrezia di Francesco Tornabuoni\r\n our father had seven children, four male and three female, of whom\r\n four are still alive. They are Giuliano my brother, aged ... and\r\n myself, aged twenty-four, Bianca, wife of Gugliemo de’ Pazzi, and\r\n Nannina, wife of Bernardo Rucellai.\r\n\r\n Giovanni d’ Averardo, surnamed Bicci, de’ Medici, our\r\n great-grandfather, died on the 20th February 1428, at the fourth\r\n hour of the night. He would not make a will, and left property to\r\n the amount of 179,221 scudi _di suggello_, as appears in a record in\r\n the handwriting of Cosimo our grandfather in his red leather book on\r\n page 7. The said Giovanni lived sixty-eight years, and left two sons,\r\n Cosimo our grandfather, then about forty, and Lorenzo, aged thirty.\r\n\r\n Lorenzo had one son, Pier Francesco, born on ... 1430, who is still\r\n alive.\r\n\r\n Cosimo had two sons, our father Piero, born ... and our uncle\r\n Giovanni, born ... On September ... 1433 our grandfather Cosimo\r\n was imprisoned in the Palace, and in danger of losing his head. On\r\n September 9th he was banished to Padua, together with his brother\r\n Lorenzo, a sentence confirmed by the Balìa of 1433 on the 11th, and on\r\n the 16th December he was permitted to reside anywhere in the Venetian\r\n territory, but not nearer to Florence than Padua.\r\n\r\n On September 29, 1434, the Council of the Balìa revoked the sentence\r\n of exile, to the great joy of the whole city and of almost all Italy,\r\n and here [in Florence] he lived until his last day as head of the\r\n government of our Republic.\r\n\r\n Lorenzo de’ Medici, brother of Cosimo our grandfather, quitted this\r\n life at Careggi on September 20, 1440, aged about forty-six, at the\r\n fourth hour of the night, and would not make a will; Pier Francesco,\r\n his son, was his sole heir. The property amounted to 235,137 scudi\r\n _di suggello_, as appears in the said book kept by Cosimo on page 13,\r\n which amount Cosimo kept for the use and benefit of the said Pier\r\n Francesco, and for Piero and Giovanni, his own sons, until they were\r\n of proper age, as appears in the books of the said Cosimo, wherein is\r\n a detailed account of all.\r\n\r\n On December ... 1451 the said Pier Francesco being of age, we\r\n divided the property according to the arbitration of Messer Mannello\r\n degl’ Strozzi, Bernardo de’ Medici, Alamanno Salviati, Messer Carlo\r\n Marsuppino, Amerigo Cavalcanti, and Giovanni Serristori, by whom a\r\n liberal half of our possessions was assigned to him, giving him the\r\n advantage over us and the best things. The deed was drawn up by Ser\r\n Antonio Pugi, notary, and at the same time we gave him an interest of\r\n one-third in our business, whereby he gained much more than we did as\r\n he had no expenses.\r\n\r\n Giovanni, our uncle (_et hujus quidem ingenio et virtute, plurimum\r\n confidebat Cosmus, qua propter ejus interitu maxime doluit_), died on\r\n November 1, 1463, in our house in Florence, without making a will,\r\n because he had no children and was under parental tutelage. But all\r\n his last wishes were faithfully carried out. By Maria Ginevra degl’\r\n Alessandri he had a son named Cosimo, who died in November 1461, at\r\n about the age of nine.\r\n\r\n Cosimo our grandfather, a man of exceeding wisdom, died at Careggi\r\n on August 1, 1464, being much debilitated by old age and by gout, to\r\n the great grief not only of ourselves and of the whole city but of\r\n all Italy, because he was most famous and adorned with many singular\r\n virtues. He died in the highest position any Florentine citizen ever\r\n attained at any period, and was buried in S. Lorenzo. He refused to\r\n make a will and forbade all pomp at his funeral. Nevertheless all\r\n the Italian princes sent to do him honour and to condole with us\r\n on his death; among others H.M. the King of France commanded that\r\n he should be honoured with his banner, but out of respect for his\r\n wishes our father would not allow it. By public decree he was named\r\n Pater Patriæ, and the decree and the letters patent are in our house.\r\n After his death much sedition arose in the city, especially was our\r\n father persecuted out of envy. From this sprang the parliament and the\r\n change of government in 1466, when Messer Agnolo Acciaiuoli, Messer\r\n Diotisalvi, Niccolò Soderini, and others were exiled, and the State\r\n was reformed.\r\n\r\n In the year 1465 H.M. King Louis of France, out of regard for the\r\n friendship between our grandfather, our father, and the House of\r\n France, decorated our escutcheon with three Lilies d’or on a field\r\n azure, which we carry at present. We have the patents with the royal\r\n seal attached, which was approved and confirmed in the Palace with\r\n nine beans [votes].\r\n\r\n In July 1467 came the Duke Galeazzo of Milan. He was fighting against\r\n Bartolomeo of Bergamo in the Romagna, who was vexing our State. By his\r\n own wish he lodged in our house, although the Signory had prepared\r\n everything for him in S. Maria Novella.\r\n\r\n In February or in March of the same year Sarzana, Sarzanelle, and\r\n Castelnuovo were bought by the aid of our father Piero from M. Lorenzo\r\n and M. Tommasino da Campofregoso; notwithstanding that we were\r\n engaged in hot war the payment was made by Francesco Sassetti, our\r\n confidential agent, at that time one of the managers of the _Monte_.\r\n\r\n I, Lorenzo, took to wife Clarice, daughter of the Lord Jacopo Orsini,\r\n or rather she was given (_i.e._ betrothed) to me in December 1468, and\r\n the marriage was celebrated in our house on June 4, 1469. Till now I\r\n have by her two children, a girl called Lucrezia, of ... years, and\r\n a boy named Piero, of ... months. Clarice is again with child. God\r\n preserve her to us for many years and guard us from all evil. Twin\r\n boys were born prematurely at about five or six months old, they lived\r\n long enough to be baptized.\r\n\r\n In July 1469 I went to Milan at the request of the Illustrious Duke\r\n Galeazzo to stand godfather as proxy for Piero our father to his\r\n first-born child. I was received with much honour, more so than the\r\n others who came for the same purpose, although they were persons more\r\n worthy than I. We paid our duty to the Duchess by presenting her with\r\n a necklace of gold with a large diamond, which cost near 2000 ducats.\r\n The consequence was that the said Lord desired that I should stand\r\n godfather to all his children.\r\n\r\n To do as others had done I held a joust in the Piazza S. Croce at\r\n great expense and with great pomp. I find we spent about 10,000 ducats\r\n _di suggello_, and although I was not highly versed in the use of\r\n weapons and the delivery of blows, the first prize was given to me; a\r\n helmet fashioned of silver, with Mars as the crest.\r\n\r\n Piero, our father, departed this life on July 2nd, aged ... having\r\n been much tormented with gout. He would not make a will, but we drew\r\n up an inventory and found we possessed 237,988 scudi, as is recorded\r\n by me in a large green book bound in kid. He was buried in S. Lorenzo,\r\n and we are still at work to make his and his brother Giovanni’s tomb\r\n as worthy to receive his bones as we can. God have mercy on their\r\n souls. He was much mourned by the whole city, being an upright man and\r\n exceedingly kindly. The princes of Italy, especially the principal\r\n ones, sent letters and envoys to condole with us and offer us their\r\n help for our defence.\r\n\r\n The second day after his death, although I, Lorenzo, was very young,\r\n being twenty years of age, the principal men of the city and of the\r\n State came to us in our house to condole with us on our loss and\r\n to encourage me to take charge of the city and of the State, as my\r\n grandfather and my father had done. This I did, though on account of\r\n my youth and the great responsibility and perils arising therefrom,\r\n with great reluctance, solely for the safety of our friends and of our\r\n possessions. For it is ill living in Florence for the rich unless they\r\n rule the State. Till now we have succeeded with honour and renown,\r\n which I attribute not to prudence but to the grace of God and the good\r\n conduct of my predecessors.\r\n\r\n I find that from 1434 till now we have spent large sums of money, as\r\n appear in a small quarto note-book of the said year to the end of\r\n 1471. Incredible are the sums written down. They amount to 663,755\r\n florins for alms, buildings, and taxes, let alone other expenses. But\r\n I do not regret this, for though many would consider it better to\r\n have a part of that sum in their purse, I consider that it gave great\r\n honour to our State, and I think the money was well expended, and am\r\n well pleased.\r\n\r\n In the month of September 1471 I was elected to go as ambassador for\r\n the coronation of Pope Sixtus, and was treated with great honour. I\r\n brought back the two antique marble heads, portraits of Augustus and\r\n Agrippa, given to me by the said Pope Sixtus, and also our cup of\r\n chalcedony incised, and many other cameos which I then bought.\r\n\r\nThe following adjunct is written on the fly-leaf of a small codex in\r\nthe archive in Florence without any date, but probably in 1483-5,\r\ncontaining a list of letters written by Lorenzo to various people, and\r\nabove is written _Ricordi di Lorenzo de’ Medici_. All the first part\r\nis in a codex in the Nazionale Library, a copy of Lorenzo’s _Ricordi_,\r\nthe original of which seems no longer to exist. It differs somewhat\r\nfrom the version given by Roscoe, which he says was in Lorenzo’s own\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\n On the 19th day of September [1483] came the news that the King of\r\n France by his own free will had given to our Giovanni the Abbey of\r\n Fonte Dolce. On the 31st we heard from Rome that the Pope had ratified\r\n this and declared him capable of holding benefices, being seven\r\n years of age, and had created him a Protonotary. On the 1st June our\r\n Giovanni came from Poggio [a Caiano] and I with him. On his arrival\r\n he was confirmed by our Monsignore of Arezzo [Gentile Becchi] who\r\n gave him the tonsure, and thereafter he was called Messer Giovanni.\r\n These ceremonies took place in our own chapel, and in the evening\r\n we returned to Poggio. On the 8th June Jacopino, the courier from\r\n France, arrived about twelve of the clock with letters from the king,\r\n who has bestowed on our Messer Giovanni the Archbishopric of Aix en\r\n Provence, and after vespers the man was despatched to Rome about this\r\n business, with letters from the King of France to the Pope and the\r\n Cardinal of Macon, and to Count Girolamo, to whom we sent at the same\r\n hour letters by the courier Zenino to Forlì. God grant that all will\r\n be well.\r\n\r\n On the 11th Zenino returned from the Count with letters for the Pope\r\n and the Cardinal of S. Giorgio, and we forwarded them to Rome by the\r\n Milan post. God grant that all will be well. On the same day after\r\n Mass in the chapel the daughters and sons of the house were confirmed,\r\n with the exception of Messer Giovanni.\r\n\r\n On the 15th, at six in the evening, came letters from Rome saying that\r\n the Pope raised difficulties about giving the archbishopric to Messer\r\n Giovanni on account of his youth, and the courier was at once sent on\r\n to the King of France.\r\n\r\n On the 20th came news from Lionetto that the Archbishop was not dead.\r\n\r\n On March 1, 1484 (1485), the Abbot of Pasignano died and we at once\r\n sent off an express messenger to Messer Giovanni d’Antonio Vespucci,\r\n our ambassador at Rome, to do all he could to obtain this abbey for\r\n our Messer Giovanni. On the 2nd we took possession of the estate under\r\n the seal of the Signoria, by reason of the reservation made by Pope\r\n Sixtus to our Messer Giovanni, confirmed by Innocent during the visit\r\n of our Piero to Rome to do obeisance.[158]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Magnificent Lorenzo, to whom heaven has given charge of the city and\r\n the State, first citizen of Florence, doubly crowned with bays lately\r\n for war in S. Croce amid the acclamations of the people [alluding to\r\n the tournament] and for poetry on account of the sweetness of your\r\n verses, give ear to me who drinking at Greek sources am striving to\r\n set Homer into Latin metre. This second book which I have translated\r\n (you know we have the first by Messer Carlo d’ Arezzo)[159] comes to\r\n you and timidly crosses your threshold. If you welcome it I propose to\r\n offer to you all the Iliad. It rests with you, who can, to help the\r\n poet. I desire no other muse or other Gods but only you; by your help\r\n I can do that of which the ancients would not have been ashamed. May\r\n it please you therefore at your leisure to give audience to Homer.\r\n The young translator, if assailed by a Zoilus, commends himself to\r\n you.--Your servant,\r\n\r\n                                            Agnolo Poliziano, 1470.[160]\r\n\r\nLorenzo, poet and fine critic, at once sent for the youth, installed\r\nhim in his palace in Via Larga and bade him continue his work. This is\r\nthe first letter Poliziano wrote to Lorenzo.[161]\r\n\r\nThe following letter to Contessina, Lorenzo’s grandmother, written\r\nin 1471 when Lorenzo and five other eminent Florentine citizens went\r\nto Rome to pay their respects to the newly elected Pontiff, shows how\r\nmen turned to the Medici for aid, and that the women of the family had\r\nmore influence than is generally supposed. Sixtus IV. named Lorenzo\r\ntreasurer to the Holy See and gave him the two busts mentioned in his\r\n_Ricordi_. He was also able to buy many fine medals, cameos, &c., as\r\nthe Pope knew nothing and cared less about art, and only thought of\r\nturning the collection made by Paul II. into money. It was probably\r\nduring this visit that the nomination of Giuliano de’ Medici to the\r\ncardinalate was broached, and Sixtus and Lorenzo, who were afterwards\r\nimplacable foes, parted the best of friends.\r\n\r\nThe next letter is from the poet Luigi Pulci who was sent to treat\r\nwith King Ferrante about establishing a branch of the Medici bank at\r\nNaples, but in order not to arouse the jealousy of the Duke of Milan he\r\nostensibly went to get fine horses. The King gave him two for Lorenzo,\r\nbut turned a deaf ear to the gentle hints about allowing Garetto,\r\nprobably a stud groom, to enter Lorenzo’s service. Soon after Pulci’s\r\nreturn he accompanied Clarice to Rome for the marriage of one of her\r\nbrothers, which was however put off.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Alexander di Conio _to_ Contessina de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Magnificent and noble Lady,--It is a usual thing when in need to\r\n address those in whom one has firm faith. Having therefore heard that\r\n the Magnificent Lorenzo has been named ambassador to His Sanctity our\r\n Holy Father, and having two sons of nearly the same age who are only\r\n desirous to do what is pleasing to you, I send one to you, praying\r\n with all my heart that it may please him to take the lad with him as\r\n his page, or attendant, or relation, or in any position he chooses.\r\n And as there is no recommendation like a mother’s I send him to you,\r\n beseeching you in God’s name to arrange that he should, if possible,\r\n take him instead of some stranger. If he be already provided, then\r\n may it please you to give him to your Giuliano or to whomso else you\r\n think fit, so that he may acquire some knowledge by your help, for\r\n he is apt: if he remains here he will learn nothing. I grieve to give\r\n you so much trouble, but I grieve more to see him anxious to learn\r\n and not to be able to help him, save through your being moved to take\r\n compassion on him. I beg you for the love of God not to abandon him,\r\n for he has a good nature and a desire to do well, and God in His grace\r\n will repay you for me. I know you are aware of my condition and so do\r\n not recall it to you; have no regard for his nobility, if you cannot\r\n place him as I said, he will always be well pleased. I give him to you\r\n entirely, and as you would accept a dog as a gift you can accept a\r\n human creature who is more faithful. I entreat you to deal with him in\r\n every way according to your wishes.\r\n\r\n May God Almighty preserve and keep you in happiness.--In Conio, on the\r\n 2nd day of September 1471.\r\n\r\n                                                  A. Alexander di Conio.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuigi Pulci _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici _at Florence_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice et generose vir et major honorande_, &c.--I know not if\r\n thou hast received my two letters from Naples. By the replies I\r\n doubt it, and therefore repeat some portions. In the last I told\r\n thee that H.M. the King, hearing that thy liking for his Fals’ Amico\r\n and Abruzzese still continued, has decided to send them both.[162]\r\n I know this because as soon as I returned to Naples the other day\r\n Count Matalona said to Gostino Billiotti, who went to see his garden,\r\n “Our Lord the King has ordered two fine horses to be sent to your\r\n Magnificent Lorenzo, and says if he wishes for others he is to say\r\n so, for finding that he takes pleasure in them, the King intends to\r\n keep him supplied, and that nothing would give him greater pleasure\r\n than to be asked for others, or for anything else.” We thanked him,\r\n and also sent thanks to H.M. the King, adding that the sooner they\r\n were sent the more welcome they would be. Yesterday we saw the Count\r\n again, and he told us that Messer Antonio Cicinello was to take the\r\n horses: he is to leave in two days, and to go to thee as ambassador.\r\n So the horses will be there in twelve days, and as I think thou wilt\r\n like them I am well pleased. In Rome I heard from Garetto that thy\r\n wish is to take him into thy service, so we have dropped gentle hints\r\n of this to H.M. the King, and now let them work. Messer Marino has\r\n done this skilfully, but the drum must not be beaten too hard, for he\r\n has been more glad to give thee these horses than thou art to have\r\n them. During these last days he talked of thee for several hours with\r\n Garetto in the presence of the Count and asked much about Giuliano,\r\n what he was like and what were his favourite pursuits. He showed such\r\n a desire to see him that one of these days thou wilt have to grant him\r\n permission to come here, where he will be received with such pleasure,\r\n and with so much honour, that all at home will be astonished: I am not\r\n exaggerating. Thou canst believe me as thou knowest, and when I return\r\n I will tell thee things that will please thee.\r\n\r\n Hadst thou done as I said, and written a line, thou wouldest have\r\n had Garetto. Certes thou hast not done this, but we will do what we\r\n can; he never tires praising thee, and wishes to live and die in thy\r\n service.\r\n\r\n A large army is being collected here against the Turks, but the King’s\r\n ambassador writes that he has small hope of any help from thee. I\r\n trust God may convert thee during Lent, and cause thee to behave as\r\n a Christian. I shall soon be with thee. My poor Bernardo has I know\r\n need of thine aid at the _Monte_ about his dower, which cost us 5 per\r\n cent. with the sister-in-law who appeared to be our friend, Luca’s\r\n dower.[163] Bernardo is timid by nature, and not enterprising like me;\r\n so I pray thee to give him the help he asks if thou canst.\r\n\r\n All thy doings are much discussed here, with us thou art in good\r\n hands, and above all thou art the darling of our Lord the King. May\r\n God preserve thee. I commend myself to thee.--Naples, February 27,\r\n 1471 (1472).\r\n\r\n To Giuliano and to all I commend myself and send greetings. Written in\r\n haste.\r\n\r\n Put Dionigi on Abruzzese, so that he may, like Francesco de’ Pazzi,\r\n regain his lady’s love; but do not keep him shut up as on the day of\r\n S. John.\r\n\r\n _Post Scriptum._--The Duke has told Gostino that the horses are to\r\n leave to-morrow with one of his own men, who will not be Garetto; but\r\n early in the morning I will try whether by means of Count Matalona it\r\n cannot be arranged. A handsome and good horse, much admired here, is\r\n also being sent for our Gugliemo de’ Pazzi, who will be pleased.[164]\r\n Commend me to him.\r\n\r\n                                                   Thy Luigi Pulci.[165]\r\n\r\n\r\nClarice de’ Medici _to her husband_ Lorenzo\r\n\r\n _Magnifice vir et coniux amantissime_,--By the present you will know\r\n what has occurred since we left. The first evening we reached Figline\r\n and stayed at S. Cerbone with Giovanni d’Antonio, who received us with\r\n great honour, and treated us with still more, as did the women of\r\n his family and some of his sisters-in-law. Then by his and Filippo’s\r\n advice, after a rest at Levane, on the second evening we arrived at\r\n Arezzo, and Morello--that is, Antonio da Pantaneto--greeted us with\r\n such honour that we were much moved. We were visited by the Captain\r\n and the Podestà and those of the Commune with such things as they\r\n deemed would do us honour, and at our arrival and departure we were\r\n accompanied by many men of worth with diverse instruments. Before\r\n starting, the Podestà of Castiglione sent a special messenger, and\r\n begged and entreated us to dine the following morning with him, which\r\n we did with the more pleasure as we heard he was much attached to\r\n your Magnificence. Then we were visited by those of the Commune, and\r\n this evening we shall be in Cortona with the Captain, who hearing from\r\n Braccio of our arrival sent as far as Castiglione to meet us. Here we\r\n have been received with joyous faces and great honour by the Captain\r\n and the Commune. We shall continue our journey with gladness, as we\r\n have done till now, if by your letter we hear that you have commended\r\n us to Mona Contessina and Mona Lucrezia, and that my Lucrezia and\r\n Piero are well. Commend me to Bianca and Nannina. If you have any news\r\n which you deem it is not necessary to keep secret we pray you not to\r\n consider it too much trouble to write me a line: it would give us\r\n great pleasure. No more at present.--April 24, 1472.[166]\r\n\r\n                                                                Clarice.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuigi Pulci _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Ardito will have given thee my letter from Sabina. From thence we\r\n went for some days to Monte Rotondo,[167] and were received with much\r\n honour. Yesterday we entered Rome in pomp with about eighty horse.\r\n Our Madonna Clarice does thee great honour everywhere, and much is\r\n paid to her. In two days I shall return to the Marches, and then to\r\n thee. According to my idea the stay here will be short--I mean thy\r\n wife’s--for as thou knowest the wedding is put off. In this case we\r\n only lose time and reputation, besides which Lucrezina and Pierino\r\n draw us back to them like magnets. Thou wouldst do well to advise a\r\n quick return. Whenever great personages, men or women, stay for long\r\n in one place they are pestered and taken as targets. Besides, some of\r\n us will be useful to thee for the feast of S. Giovanni; more than a\r\n year has passed since the last, and I know that without us things will\r\n lag. Enough that if I have the hope that as usual _festaiuoli_[168]\r\n are to be appointed, I shall whisper something into the ear of one of\r\n them that will delight him. I rather wonder at thy letting this feast\r\n pass with so little recognition, being so good a citizen and lover of\r\n thy country, whose protector is S. Giovanni; we should therefore do\r\n him honour. If by any mischance we are not back in time, thou wilt see\r\n how ill they get on without us. I have said enough to be understood,\r\n believe in one who has sharp eyes and can speak the truth. Send for\r\n us. We take the road by Siena, and shall look out for falls, but at\r\n last we shall arrive triumphantly.\r\n\r\n To-day there is strange news from Volterra. They say H.M. the King\r\n [of Naples] has sent word to the Count of Urbino that he is to march\r\n and do what he can. All the follies I said unfortunately turn out to\r\n be prophecies. Now act so that things may go well. Monsignor of Pavia\r\n speaks only of thee. If I understand anything he is thy true friend.\r\n No more. Farewell.--Rome, May 6, 1472.\r\n\r\n                                                   Thy Luigi Pulci.[169]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Sixtus IV.[170]\r\n\r\n _Sanctissime et Beatissime Pater_,--To avoid troubling your Beatitude\r\n I have written to Giovanni Tornabuoni and told him to talk with you\r\n about the long-standing desire of our house to have a Cardinal.\r\n Although I have such entire faith in Your Sanctity that I am sure it\r\n is needless again to solicit what was so freely promised, nevertheless\r\n as there is a report that Cardinals are soon to be created I thought\r\n it best to remind your Beatitude of this our desire; supplicating\r\n with all humility that to our other everlasting obligations your\r\n Beatitude will deign to add this one, which will be the greatest and\r\n the most prized, as Giovanni will explain. I beg Your Beatitude to\r\n accord him the same confidence as though I was speaking with Your\r\n Holiness, at whose feet I commend myself and my affairs with all\r\n humility.--Florence, November 21, 1472. _Humilis Servus_,\r\n\r\n                                             Laurentius de Medicis.[171]\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written after Lorenzo’s visit to Volterra. The\r\ncity had rebelled against Florence in consequence of a dispute between\r\na company in which Florentine shareholders were interested, and the\r\nCommune of Volterra about an alum mine. The Commune alleged that the\r\nlease was illegal and seized the mine, whereupon the company appealed\r\nto the Signoria of Florence. Volterra had already, in 1429, attempted\r\nto rise against the imposition of the _catasto_, and the Florentines\r\nnow determined to take severe measures.[172] Duke Federigo of Urbino,\r\nthe Florentine general, in command of some six thousand men, including\r\ncontingents from the Pope and the Duke of Milan, attacked the city. Her\r\nmercenaries refused to fight, and she capitulated after a siege of\r\ntwenty-five days. When the troops entered there was an uproar, caused\r\nit is said by a mercenary in the service of the city, which was sacked\r\nand the inhabitants were brutally maltreated in spite of the efforts of\r\nthe Florentine commanders.[173] Many historians have accused Lorenzo\r\nof being the prime instigator of the attack on Volterra in order to\r\nget control of the alum mine. But his name is not in the list of\r\nshareholders and the deposit of alum was too small to compete with the\r\nmines of Tolfa of which he was the lessee (see pp. 98-99), and was soon\r\nafterwards abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngherami di Volterra, _Apostolic Scribe, to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice vir et protector mi singularis commendatione premissa_,\r\n &c.,--I derived great consolation from the visit of Your Magnificence\r\n to Volterra. With your own eyes you should see and judge far better\r\n than by listening to the accounts of others of the public and private\r\n despair and misery here. You have seen the afflicted and faithful\r\n friends and servants of Your Magnificence naked, despoiled of all\r\n their goods, robbed without mercy, for everything was taken during\r\n the sack of the city; and I doubt not that Your Magnificence with\r\n your kindly nature was moved to great compassion. Your arrival and\r\n seeing with your own eyes has been the sole hope of this people and\r\n has consoled and comforted them greatly. Therefore by this present\r\n and by other letters I have written to Your Magnificence (I know\r\n not whether you received them), I beg and pray of you not to allow\r\n them to be deprived of that hope, and to show them your justice and\r\n grace by helping and restoring, and listening to the prayers of this\r\n wretched and miserable city. Now that she belongs faithfully and\r\n devotedly to Your Magnificence and to the Florentine State she ceases\r\n to be an enemy. All now depends on Your Magnificence. We do not so\r\n much expect as feel certain that we shall receive this help from you;\r\n first from your own goodness, and then for love of the blessed memory\r\n of the grandfather and father of Your Magnificence, to whom this\r\n poor and miserable city, which always formed part and parcel of the\r\n house of Your Magnificence, showed such reverence. Especially we your\r\n partisans, for our affection and devotion, have been so ill-treated\r\n and smitten that we are reduced to nothing, unless Your Magnificence,\r\n who has never known what it is to be ungrateful or unjust, does not\r\n let us share in your victory as belonging entirely to you, and taking\r\n pity on our unhappy and miserable condition will care for and guard\r\n us, who desire only to live and die under the protection of Your\r\n Magnificence, whom God preserve in happiness.--Volterra, March 10,\r\n 1472 (1473).[174]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancesco Filelfo _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici[175]\r\n\r\n _Magnifice et Clarissime Vir_,--The Magnificent Messer Ciccho, my\r\n compeer, has advised me that I should be better and more quickly\r\n employed in the service of friends of this Illustrious Lord [Duke of\r\n Milan] than in Rome or any other place, and has mentioned the chair\r\n which Your Illustrious Republic has instituted anew at Pisa. Advice\r\n was indeed unnecessary, for I desire nothing better than to be in a\r\n place where I can use my abilities in the service of that renowned\r\n Signoria, and more particularly in yours, to whom I am so indebted.\r\n But considering your laws against rebels, among whom, thanks to Carlo\r\n d’Arezzo and Poggio with their crew, I was most unjustly included, I\r\n have delayed making any application as I thought it would be useless.\r\n Now however that my beloved compeer has again mentioned it, and\r\n remembering the Greek proverb that the potter fixes the handle on\r\n whichever side of the pot seems best to him, I have determined to\r\n write to you and to beg Your Magnificence to consider this, for you\r\n well know that in this land you cannot find another Philelphus or a\r\n man more devoted to yourself.\r\n\r\n Then about my coats which are together with the books which you have\r\n recovered for me. They are three, two of crimson velvet, the other a\r\n cloak of rose-coloured cloth lined with rose-coloured silk. You would\r\n do me a great service if you would order the cloak to be given back to\r\n me as I need it now the weather is warmer, also it might be spoiled\r\n by cockroaches, as it is together with those that are lined with fur.\r\n _Vale spes mia._--Milan, April 23, 1473.[176]\r\n\r\n\r\nJacopo Ammanati, _Cardinal of Pavia, to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Lorenzo mine,--Your Donato having provided me with spectacles to see\r\n far and near, I now write to try whether they are good. And you will\r\n have patience if it is not clear, for nature’s laws are inexorable.\r\n I will be as brief as possible. It will not be long before the Holy\r\n Father will be obliged to make new Cardinals, particularly for those\r\n States which have none. You, for instance, are without, which for many\r\n reasons is unseemly. There has been much talk here of your Giuliano,\r\n and by fishing at the fountain-head I find he has been mentioned in\r\n the proper quarter. I know not what are your intentions, and do not\r\n pretend to give advice as I am sure you know the needs of your house\r\n better than I. All I say is that you must make up your mind. If you\r\n do think of Giuliano I doubt he may be too unpolished at present to\r\n please here; it would be better for him to assume the surplice of the\r\n Church or of a Protonotary, then I think there would be no difficulty.\r\n If, to avoid any accidents and to preserve your house or for any other\r\n reason, this plan does not please you (and the suggestion should come\r\n from others and not from yourself), you had better reflect whether\r\n the Archbishop of Pisa[177] or any one else would suit you, and take\r\n measures, for to remain inert is unwise, particularly as you consider\r\n that a Cardinal would be useful to the city and to yourself. Choose\r\n any one, so he is not a person to be ashamed of. On my part whatever\r\n aid a poor priest can give is yours as is my bounden duty. For this I\r\n have written you these few words, which accept as from a good friend\r\n and a lover of you and of your country, to which I owe much. _Bene\r\n Valete._--_Romæ_, April 25, 1473.[178]\r\n\r\n\r\nJacopo Ammanati, _Cardinal of Pavia, to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Lorenzo mine,--This is the result of a long conversation with Giovanni\r\n [Tornabuoni]. I am not in the position to advise you whether it would\r\n be well to continue this affair of your Giuliano, because it depends\r\n on the state of things in Florence, with which I am not familiar. You\r\n know them better than I. Only I wished for information _in utramque\r\n partem_, whether yes or no. To begin with, any possible danger to\r\n yourself or to your house is a matter that must be considered, for\r\n many eyes are upon you both at home and abroad; a man sees and hopes\r\n to be able to give one blow, who has no hope of giving two, and thinks\r\n that striking one adversary will serve his purpose; but the other\r\n would remain, and thus his design would fail. Braccio of Perugia did\r\n not attack his enemy, Messer Pandolfo, until after many months he saw\r\n father and son together in one place; then having both, he cut the\r\n tree and its roots with one stroke. Besides this danger there is the\r\n other of sickness, which occurs every day. Should it please God to\r\n call you to Himself, and Giuliano were in the position we are striving\r\n for while your children were still young, it seems to me your house\r\n would be in danger to lose the pre-eminence left by Cosimo to Piero,\r\n and by Piero to you, and with the pre-eminence lose the riches, and\r\n thus close the door against your successors. On the other hand, there\r\n is the reputation which would be acquired by the enhanced dignity of\r\n Giuliano, the aid he might give to your State, and the certainty of\r\n having a trusty person in the College. Then one hopes that, as danger\r\n increases, your watchfulness would also increase, that God in His\r\n mercy will preserve you, and that you may live long enough to see\r\n your children be a support to you, and finally that they will inherit\r\n your high position. But, as I said before, you must judge according\r\n to matters domestic and public in Florence what is best to be done.\r\n Speaking for myself, nothing would be more pleasing than to have the\r\n company of Giuliano, and we having such a pledge should be entitled to\r\n expect faithful aid from your State. His joyous nature would make us\r\n all jocund and happy.\r\n\r\n Let us therefore assume that you say Yes. I will tell you frankly my\r\n opinion how the business ought to be managed. I consider it necessary\r\n that he should be made a Protonotary and be seen in that dress\r\n for at least a month; for none of us would venture to suggest that\r\n from a layman he should at once be promoted to so high a position.\r\n But I should not let him take any holy orders until what he desires\r\n has been accomplished, so that if difficulties arise he may be at\r\n liberty to return to his usual dress, a thing I have seen done quite\r\n justifiably by others. His position would not be that of a full\r\n Cardinal; _videlicet_ he would only have four or six chaplains in\r\n his train, and eight equerries to precede him. Because, although we\r\n are sure to do much more for him, here humility is much prized. _In\r\n reliquis_, between Messer Gentile [Bishop of Arezzo] and myself,\r\n for I shall regard him as my son, he shall be so advised as to gain\r\n universal commendation. I see no difficulty, if his Holiness lives,\r\n to his attaining the highest honour, for I can promise for more than\r\n one [vote]. Have no uneasiness about the cardinals who have just been\r\n made, as it will be necessary soon to create others for the Emperor\r\n and King Ferdinand, for Rome and for you Florentines, if you desire\r\n it; it had been arranged to await Pentecost for their nominations,\r\n but certain reasons, as you will have heard, induced greater haste.\r\n In short, Lorenzo, examine well my advice and that of others who are\r\n better informed, which I think you will have received: _et tandem_ put\r\n your trust in God as to what path to pursue. Take a courageous course,\r\n and tell me what you wish done. It would, however, be well beforehand\r\n to inform the Duke of Milan, _et quidem pro forma_, in order that he\r\n should not say No to what you desire; if you are in doubt ask for his\r\n real opinion. For my own satisfaction I have not contented myself\r\n with writing to Giovanni [Tornabuoni], but have scrawled these lines.\r\n I am fond of you, and I love you, not your position or your riches.\r\n Charity bids me say everything openly, and attribute everything to\r\n her. _Dominus Deus sit in corde vestro, et dirigat gressus vestros\r\n in semitam rectam._ That He should do this increase your donations\r\n to pious works and cause special prayers to be made, for in truth\r\n the affair is not a light one, or of small importance, and all in\r\n my judgment depends on His clemency. _Bene Valete._--Rome, May 15,\r\n 1473.[179]\r\n\r\nThis letter is inserted to show how all in trouble or distress turned\r\nfor help to Madonna Lucrezia, knowing her kindly disposition, and the\r\ngreat influence she had over her son Lorenzo.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Syndic and Ancients of Galatea _to_ Lucrezia de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifica ac generosa domina nostra singularissima_,--Your\r\n Magnificence is aware how attached and bound to your house our\r\n community has always been and will be as long as life lasts. This\r\n encourages us to turn to you in our necessities and troubles, and also\r\n in those of any of our friends who have need to have recourse to Your\r\n Magnificence who has always been kind to us and helped us. We hope\r\n now more than ever in you on account of the great faith we all have\r\n in your house; for could you but know you would find the name of your\r\n family written in the hearts of big and little of our community. Now\r\n Magnificent Madonna, after such long and tedious words, we come to\r\n implore aid from Your Magnificence. It is several months since one\r\n Ser Michele, a priest, was seized by the Lords of Vazoca, they say\r\n for coining money, and after suffering much torture he was put in the\r\n Stinche,[180] thus it may be conceived that he has been sufficiently\r\n punished for his sins. Here live some relations of his, honourable\r\n men, who are desirous for the honour of the world to liberate him from\r\n such misery, and we, agreeing with him, come to beg Your Magnificence\r\n to ask them [the Lords of Vazoca] to allow him to be released from\r\n this wretchedness so that he should not die in such infamy. Your\r\n Magnificence would be doing a most kind act to this community for\r\n which we shall be ever grateful. We commend him strongly to you, and\r\n also we commend ourselves, offering to Your Magnificence your ever\r\n ready and most faithful servants the Syndic General _Vexillifori et\r\n Antiani_ of the Commune of Galatea.--Ex Galatea, 23rd August 1473.[181]\r\n\r\n\r\nFra Cristofano d’Antonio di Mast ... _to_ Lucrezia de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Illustrious Matron and Lady,--I have not written before, because I\r\n know that my news will have reached you in other letters. Nevertheless\r\n the more good one hears of one’s family the more contented and happy\r\n one is; let us thank God heartily with words and acts, as S. Paul says\r\n to the Ephesians in the epistle we shall read on Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n To begin with, Mona Contessina is well. Giuliano is as usual. I have\r\n often been to see Mona Bianca[182] who is well, and her children\r\n have been for three days with Mona Contessina to her great delight.\r\n Lucrezia still has a little eczema, otherwise she is well, and is well\r\n cared for by Mona Nanna and she ...[183]; little Lucrezia is obedient,\r\n like the wise little person she is. Piero has a fine colour and is\r\n happy and full of spirits, by the grace of God; he often comes to the\r\n side door calling you all, saying Granny, Papa, and Mamma, so that\r\n you would laugh if you were here. Maddalena is also well and every\r\n day when I return from the house of the Tornabuoni I go to stay a\r\n little with her, and to the wet nurse I say, “Now go, walk a little;”\r\n so that she may amuse herself and take some exercise, and thus keep\r\n in good health and have better milk. She is very pleased, and thanks\r\n me saying, “I shall pray to God for you.” Of a truth she serves you\r\n faithfully and well. Mona Nannina’s[184] Cosimino is well but will\r\n not read, saying, “I did not come into the country to read.” This\r\n displeases Mona Contessina. In November we will make up for lost time.\r\n Galasso[185] comes to read with me every morning, and then I go,\r\n for love of the children, back with him. He gives me much trouble,\r\n although it does not seem great to me, because I do it willingly for\r\n the love of God, and for love of Lorenzo, Mona Clarice, and you,\r\n for you know I am yours. I have even for the honour of God made him\r\n learn by heart little by little the Salve Regina, and part of the\r\n introit and of the psalter. Sister Magante has gone to another world,\r\n _requiescat in pace_. I know that you must have many petitioners,\r\n but when any little thing like this of small value falls in, think\r\n of me, you know my need, and that you would have a faithful servant.\r\n All your relations are well. Mona Bartolomea and Mona Francesca often\r\n go to see Mona Contessina and the children. The men are well also.\r\n All commend themselves to you. I commend myself to you, to Lorenzo,\r\n to Mona Clarice, and to Mona Nannina. No more. Christ guard you from\r\n ill.--September 25, 1473.\r\n\r\n                                   Your Cristofano d’Antonio di Mast ...\r\n                                   Priest....[186]\r\n\r\n\r\nMatteo Franco _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici[187]\r\n\r\n Lorenzo mine,--Have mercy. God well knows how and in what attitude\r\n I write to you. A chopping-board on my bed, whereon lies my paper,\r\n my arm bare with the sleeve rolled up, I am as a dead man laden\r\n with bricks, with a head like a big onion on an arid heap of\r\n cappelline,[188] I seem to be all east wind. With trembling voice and\r\n hands I write, Signor mine, because the sacristan of Or San Michele\r\n has just come to my bedside to tell me that the priest of my little\r\n church, which Your Magnificence promised me, is dead; it is at Empoli\r\n and worth twelve or fifteen florins a month, and there are no duties.\r\n Now being vacant, Lorenzo my life and hope, I throw myself into your\r\n arms. I know not what to say. I have but my own mother-wit and my\r\n tongue. Do not judge of me for the love of God by my writing, but\r\n by my affection, my need, and the straits in which I find myself. I\r\n commend myself to you as heartily as I can and will not again molest\r\n you. No more, in haste, I am sweating as though I were harnessed to a\r\n waggon. God keep you in health and prosperity, and inspire you to do\r\n what is best for the salvation of my soul.--April 1, 1474.\r\n\r\n                                                     Your Matteo Franco.\r\n\r\n Not most faithful servant, for as yet there is nothing in which I can\r\n be faithful.[189]\r\n\r\n\r\nGiuliano de’ Medici _from Pisa to his mother_ Lucrezia\r\n\r\n The Lady Lucretia de Medici most dear to me,--So that you should know\r\n something about us since our departure we send you word that, thanks\r\n be to God, we have arrived safely, and are all very well. We are in\r\n the midst of a thousand fine doings here, of which you shall hear more\r\n by word of mouth when we return. Yesterday we had dinner with our\r\n rector, which was magnificent, and he played the pedant. To-day is the\r\n ball, and to-morrow I shall go my own way, for there is much to see;\r\n it is a beautiful place. Till now we have not had a moment without\r\n entertainments, which are given in our honour.\r\n\r\n We have no more to say; if you want anything from here let us\r\n know.--Pisa, May 16, 1474.\r\n\r\n                                                          Jul. Med.[190]\r\n\r\n\r\nBertoldo di Giovanni _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Magnificent Lorenzo, &c.,--This moment I have thrown away burin,\r\n chisel, compasses, square, wax, modelling tools, architecture,\r\n perspective, have given four kicks to that bull, and have sent back\r\n the clay to the potter, because hideous pots had been made for me,\r\n and because I perceive that the peppered dishes of our knight of\r\n Prato, Messer Luca Calvanese, are more esteemed by Count Girolamo\r\n than all other talents, sciences, or arts, they having obtained for\r\n him knighthood. Now the art of cooking is not inborn in Luca, but has\r\n been obtained by him in a piggish way solely out of my book, and I\r\n believe the cleanest dish he ever prepared was at Monte Guffoni, when\r\n he gave you two plates full of beccafichi[191] cooked by hand. So I\r\n have determined to abandon all other arts and to take to cooking, and\r\n therefore pray Your Magnificence to recommend me to the head steward,\r\n who is over the cooks, in order that I may get back my book. I hope\r\n that in a short time Messer Luca of the Pepper will not be able to\r\n hold a sieve. I would to God I had been brought up under Cibacca[192]\r\n instead of under Donatello, for seeing how times go, before I had made\r\n two giacomini[193] or two jellies, the Count would have created me\r\n Prior of Pisa. And I say if they make him head of the giants, or of\r\n something else which had better not be mentioned, you are the better\r\n judge, I being a pupil of Donato. But above all, before Messer Luca\r\n has taken possession of it, I beg you to get me back my cookery book.\r\n Once I have it in my hands trust me to put him, his pepper-pot, his\r\n wantons and his title, into a pie covered with pepper, without passing\r\n them through a sieve, and then I will make so many pills of it. May\r\n God send all that court to the devil. I pray Him that I may see the\r\n Pope, the Count, and Messer Luca suffocated in a vat full of pepper,\r\n and you, beware of their treachery. From the castle of S. Anthony in\r\n the Wilderness.--[No date.] From your servant\r\n\r\n                                                          Bertoldo.[194]\r\n\r\nIn 1475 everything was peaceful in Italy. Lorenzo was able to give his\r\nattention to the reconstruction of the University of Pisa, in which\r\ntown he spent some months, to devote himself to poetry and philosophy,\r\nand often to indulge in his love of outdoor sports. Niccolò Roberti,\r\nDuke Borso d’Este’s ambassador to Florence, wrote to his master in\r\nJanuary:\r\n\r\n\r\n Most illustrious Lord,--There is no news to send save that near Pisa,\r\n where Lorenzo is enjoying much sport with the King’s [Ferrante of\r\n Naples] hawkers, two of the falcons sent to him by H.M. have been\r\n lost, and they are the two best. Your Excellency must not wonder at my\r\n sending such news, because here little else is talked about. Idleness\r\n is so universal in Italy that if things do not change there will be\r\n more to write of battles between birds and dogs than of armies and\r\n gallant deeds.--January 22, 1474 (1475).\r\n\r\nIn this same year was held Giuliano de’ Medici’s magnificent and costly\r\ntournament, which would however be forgotten had not Poliziano written\r\nhis immortal _Stanze per la Giostra del Magnifico Giuliano di Piero\r\nde’ Medici_, “a masterpiece,” writes Symonds, “which blent the ancient\r\nand the modern world in a work of art glowing with Italian fancy....\r\nEach stanza of _La Giostra_ is a mimic world of beauty, art, and\r\nscholarship; a painting where the object stands before us modelled with\r\nrelief of light and shade in finely modulated lines....”[195]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _at Pisa to_ Clarice de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifica Domina mea_,--I did not write yesterday to Your\r\n Magnificence because Lorenzo sent me to Lucca. I have just come back\r\n and take up my pen to keep faith with you. Lorenzo is well and in good\r\n spirits. Yesterday as there was but little wind he went hawking; but\r\n they had not much luck because the young falcon belonging to Pilato,\r\n called the Mantuan, was lost. This morning they went out again, but\r\n the wind was not favourable, nevertheless we saw some fine flights,\r\n and Maestro Giorgio flew his Peregrine falcon which came back to\r\n the lure most obediently.[196] Lorenzo is quite in love with it. Of\r\n a truth he is not wrong, for Maestro Giorgio says he never saw a\r\n handsomer or a better, and declares he will make of him the finest\r\n falcon in the world. While we were in the fields Pilato came back from\r\n the river with his lost falcon, so Lorenzo was doubly pleased. If I\r\n knew what to write I should be glad: but I can only give you news\r\n of his hawking as we do nought else in the fore- and the afternoon.\r\n This evening I hear that on Monday Lorenzo intends to hunt roe deer\r\n and then to return at once to Florence. Please God we may find you\r\n well and with a boy in your arms.[197] I commend myself to Your\r\n Magnificence.--In Pisa, December 1, 1475.

Your servant,\r\n\r\n                                           Agnolo da Montepulciano.[198]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _to_ Clarice de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifica Domina mea_,--Yesterday after leaving Florence we came as\r\n far as San Miniato [al Tedesco], singing all the way, and occasionally\r\n talking of holy things so as not to forget Lent. At Lastra [a Signa]\r\n we drank _zappolino_, which tasted much better than I had been told.\r\n Lorenzo is brilliant and makes the whole company gay: yesterday I\r\n counted twenty-six horses of those who are with him. When we reached\r\n San Miniato yester evening we began to read a little of S. Augustine,\r\n then the reading resolved itself into music, and looking at and\r\n instructing a certain well-known dancer who is here. Lorenzo is just\r\n going to Mass. I will finish another time.--At San Miniato, April 8\r\n (1476). Servitor.\r\n\r\n                                                       Your Agnolo.[199]\r\n\r\n\r\nClarice de’ Medici _to her husband_ Lorenzo _at Florence_\r\n\r\n By the bearer we send you seventeen partridges which your falconers\r\n took to-day. I should have been glad had you come to enjoy them with\r\n us; we have expected you until the third hour [an hour before sunset]\r\n for the last three evenings. I was astonished you did not come and\r\n fear something extraordinary must have happened to keep you. I beg\r\n that if it is so you will let me know, for surely it is in any case\r\n better we should be together than one in France and the other in\r\n Lombardy. I expect you at all events to-morrow and pray if it is\r\n possible that we should not await you in vain. The children are well\r\n and so are all the rest of the family. I commend myself to you, and\r\n beg you to come and to bring Madonna Lucrezia.--Cafaggiuolo, August\r\n 20, 1476.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici, _from Bagno a Morba, to her son_ Lorenzo\r\n\r\n By the grace of God we have arrived safely and well at Bagno a Morba,\r\n I trust He will keep you the same. Of the riding horses we have kept\r\n here the ambling palfrey and the chestnut as best suited to this\r\n place. So have patience if we have not sent back the palfrey as you\r\n desired: none of the others stood the journey well, and it seemed best\r\n to me to keep these so that should anything happen we should not be\r\n forced to go afoot. But if you want him, tell me, and send us another\r\n horse instead. They shall be well looked after here. Of the honours\r\n paid us and the amusing things that have happened you shall hear in\r\n my next, as the bearer of this has one foot in the stirrup. To begin\r\n with, the rooms are like those of an alchemist [_i.e._ small, dark,\r\n and hot] and the bugs are as big as capons. Lionardo and Sano can\r\n testify to this, they were the first to begin the hunt. _Valete._ In\r\n haste.--On the 10th day of May 1477.\r\n\r\n                                   L. de Medicis, at Bagno a Morba.[200]\r\n\r\nThis letter was dictated to some secretary, and the handwriting is\r\nplain enough. Whenever Lucrezia dictates evidently the writer did not\r\nthink it respectful to use _thou_, which she always uses when writing\r\nwith her own hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici, _from Bagno a Morba, to her son_ Lorenzo _at Pisa_\r\n\r\n _Salutem_, &c. I send you sixteen flasks of good old Greek wine:\r\n eight of Poggibonsi, marked with ink: and eight of Colle. To us they\r\n seem good, you must however choose, and four _torte besse_ (cakes\r\n made at Siena). I do this because I think that with the arrival of\r\n the Madama[201] you may need them, although I doubt not you have\r\n made every provision. Yet as I had these and they seemed to me good\r\n I send them, for I think they may please you. Do not let the carrier\r\n return here empty. Oranges, biscuits, and _marino_[202] would be met\r\n with banners flying. No more at present. I am well and hope for good\r\n results from the baths. God be thanked, may He keep you well. In\r\n haste.--On the 23rd day of May 1477.\r\n\r\n                                                Your Lucrezia de’ Medici\r\n                                                at Bagno a Morba.[203]\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici (_Lorenzo’s daughter, born 1470_) _to her\r\ngrandmother_ Lucrezia _at Bagno a Morba_\r\n\r\n Magnificent Grandmother mine,--Let me know how you are and when you\r\n began your baths. It seems to me a thousand years since you left, and\r\n every day I say a Pater noster and an Ave Maria for your return well\r\n and happy. Send me that basket of roses you promised. We are all well\r\n here, all we children with Mona Clarice. Mona Bartolomea and all her\r\n family are here too, tell Leonardo that they are well and commend me\r\n to him. We often go up to your little spring, and there we talk of\r\n you. Lorenzo has gone to Pisa, may God accompany him, he will come\r\n back to us soon.\r\n\r\n I pray you to be careful and of good cheer for love of me, so that you\r\n may return well and bright, it seems a thousand years to me. If I can\r\n do aught for you here, command me.--Written on May 24, 1477. No more.\r\n May Christ guard you.\r\n\r\n                                 Your Lucrezia de’ Medici, Careggi.[204]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _to_ Lucrezia de’ Medici _at Bagno a Morba_\r\n\r\n _Magnifica Domina mea honoranda_,--the family are all well. Lorenzo\r\n has informed us of the honours paid to Madama of Ferrara at Pisa, so\r\n I do not repeat what no doubt you have heard from others. She left\r\n evidently well pleased.\r\n\r\n There is again talk about the affairs at Milan and the Lord Ruberto\r\n [Count of San Severino]. You will have heard how he went to Milan with\r\n Messer Obietto, and it appears the Illustrious Madonna Duchess heard\r\n of some understanding between them. Donato del Conte, who was also in\r\n the secret, was sent for and imprisoned. Upon which it seems the Lord\r\n Ruberto took arms with his followers and attempted to raise the city\r\n together with some of the Duke’s brothers. Then seeing there was no\r\n hope he fled, and with him went Messer Obietto, who they say to-day\r\n has been taken; of the Lord Ruberto there is as yet no news. The\r\n Duke’s brothers have implored the Duchess to forgive them, alleging\r\n as an excuse that they feared for their lives. The Lord Ottaviano is\r\n reported to have been drowned while flying from his pursuers. There\r\n is also the affair of Messer Antonio Ridolfo, who was attacked by\r\n some soldiers of Pietra Santa and Melia on his way from the Riviera\r\n of Genoa. After a skirmish of several miles his mounted crossbow-men\r\n showed good fight and wounded and killed those soldiers with great\r\n honour to themselves, and Messer Antonio arrived here safe and sound.\r\n\r\n Your Piero and Lucrezia and the other children are well and commend\r\n themselves to Your Magnificence. I have not been able to write to\r\n you because I am at Careggi, and therefore have no means of sending\r\n letters. Madonna Clarice, Bianca and Nannina, and all our people are\r\n well. I commend myself to Your Magnificence.--Florence, the last day\r\n of May 1477. Your Magnificence’s servant,\r\n\r\n                                                       Angelus Pol.[205]\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici, _from Bagno a Morba, to her son_ Lorenzo\r\n\r\n _Salvus sis, mi suavissime filii_,--To-day I have received a letter\r\n in thy name which has caused me much rejoicing, particularly as thou\r\n sayest thou art well and also the others. I am delighted to hear of\r\n the marriage arranged between Cosimino Rucellai[206] and the daughter\r\n of the Marquess Gabbrielle. Quite an unexpected piece of news. Coming\r\n from so good a source it must be good; and having been settled by\r\n so excellent a person, excellent. We are celebrating it with great\r\n rejoicings, and so are all the people of the Bagni. To so fortunate\r\n and good a beginning may God grant a joyous and happy ending, _et\r\n suffit_. By the grace of God I am well and have nearly finished my\r\n baths. I have decided, if it pleases God, to leave this on the 21st,\r\n that is Saturday week, and to stay the night with Madonna Tita, widow\r\n of Messer Antonio Cortesi, at San Gemignano. She has been with me here\r\n for several days and entreated me to do this; then she sent her son,\r\n who left this morning, to settle about the visit. So because of her\r\n entreaties, and because she is a widow, I have been forced to promise\r\n without awaiting thy assent. We shall go quietly and stay little, and\r\n on Monday the eve of S. John [23rd June] we shall be at home. I do\r\n not see my way to come before, as I am still weak from the effects\r\n of the baths. But should any necessity arise for me to come sooner,\r\n let me know and I will leave all. Send the horses, if it suits thee,\r\n to arrive here on the 19th, so that they can rest on the 20th, and as\r\n I have said, we start early on the 21st. Seven horses must be sent,\r\n nought else is wanted. May Christ keep you all. I commend myself to\r\n thee.--In haste on the 8th day of June 1477.\r\n\r\n                                                           Thy Lucrezia.\r\n\r\n I have given orders to Maso of Fiesole for the donkeys and mules he is\r\n to send.[207]\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici _to her son_ Lorenzo, _from Bagno a Morba_\r\n\r\n _Karissime filii salutem_, &c.,--To-day the 18th the horses have\r\n arrived, two days before the time; I suppose by the over-zeal of\r\n whoever was charged to send them. It does not matter, although there\r\n is a dearth of stabling, straw, and oats, but we have sent them where\r\n they will be well cared for and fed until we leave as I said on\r\n the 21st. I cannot leave before as I am very weak and have not yet\r\n finished my baths. But to keep my word and be with thee on S. John’s\r\n day I shall leave, although if I remained another eight days it would\r\n be more necessary than superfluous. However now it is settled. We\r\n shall not be at Florence before Monday for the reasons already given.\r\n So that if thou hast sent the horses before the time fixed in order\r\n that I might be home earlier, forgive me: if I had received a letter\r\n from thee urging me to return I should have left at once without\r\n considering my own convenience and well-being. Nought else. I commend\r\n myself to thee and pray God to keep thee well and happy. Salute the\r\n family and tell them I shall be at home on the vigil of S. John, if it\r\n pleases God, for I never expected to live so long. In haste, in haste,\r\n on the 18th day [of June] 1477.\r\n\r\n                                     Thy Lucrezia at Bagno a Morba.[208]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero Malegonnelle (_Vicar of Pomerance_) _to_ Lucrezia de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Honoured as a Mother,--Being here at Bagno a Morba, and hearing that\r\n what I always desired has been accomplished,[209] it is only my duty\r\n to congratulate you, not so much because of your satisfaction, as for\r\n the good of what otherwise would never have risen again to its ancient\r\n reputation. May God be pleased to give you grace to enjoy it for a\r\n long, long time. There is the same quantity of water in the baths as\r\n before, but with the new cistern we have made there will be more and\r\n of a better quality, as Riccio, the bearer of this letter, can fully\r\n explain when he sees you. Riccio and his brother understand such\r\n works, as you know. I recommend them to you most heartily in case you\r\n need their services here.\r\n\r\n As the one necessary thing is to try and conduct as much water as\r\n possible to the baths, having to remain near here this winter, which\r\n I take to be the best time for searching for the springs, if you send\r\n an efficient and able man I offer, as is my bounden duty, to aid him\r\n in every way. It only remains for me to place myself at your disposal\r\n and to commend myself to you. May the Almighty keep you in health and\r\n happiness.--Bagno a Morba, on the 16th day of September 1477. Your\r\n servant,\r\n\r\n                                                Piero Malegonnelle.[210]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero Malegonnelle (_Vicar of Pomerance_) _to_ Lucrezia de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Most honoured as a Mother,--As I shall leave at the end of my service\r\n here and am expecting my successor from day to day, I have not written\r\n about the baths. I went there last Friday and found the water had\r\n increased rather than diminished, and that it was extremely hot. The\r\n trench is finished from where the water rises under the building as\r\n far as the baths which have been rebuilt, and are twelve in number.\r\n The cistern is also finished, except covering in the roof, according\r\n to the designs sent; and as far as my poor judgment goes all seems to\r\n me well done, saving that the water will enter the cistern at only\r\n one place and then will have to flow 12-3/4 yards, so that I fear\r\n the baths will be too hot to be borne where the water enters and not\r\n hot enough at the other end. I think the water ought to be brought\r\n into the cistern by two conduits. This might still be easily arranged\r\n by dividing the channel in two when it reaches the room where the\r\n shower baths are, and digging another trench 19 yards long 2-3/4 yards\r\n further in. This can always be done if necessary. There has been some\r\n difficulty in the work, as just under the hill where the water comes\r\n out they have been obliged to underpin the ground and then to cut\r\n through the rock from whence the water comes. But the rock is hard and\r\n 3 yards 30 inches thick, and a channel 2 feet long has to be cut in\r\n order that the water may have sufficient fall to flow under the small\r\n palace to the baths. In two or three days I think it will be finished.\r\n The lime has been burnt and they say it is good, about eighty bushels\r\n for twenty soldi; and in the fields opposite the trench they have\r\n found earth fit for making tiles and bricks. The levellers are at work\r\n making them and a Lombard has undertaken to bake them, so they will\r\n cost four lire or less the thousand. They are now in the kiln and this\r\n will be a great saving to you. The room for the shower baths, 4-1/2\r\n yards wide and 12-3/4 yards long, is partly finished, and the bath\r\n at the side also. They say they need certain slabs which are made on\r\n purpose for shower baths, and they want them at once. Riccio has been\r\n dismissed from the inn and Giovanni di Pace has taken it and says that\r\n he has orders for rooms from Volterra, Florence, and elsewhere, and\r\n that in addition to what he has he needs all the things noted in the\r\n enclosed list. The orchard has been planted in a way that will please\r\n you when you see it. I say no more but commend myself to you and may\r\n God preserve you in happiness. Ex Castro di Pomarancii, March 25, 1478.\r\n\r\n                           Petrus de Malegonnellis, _Vicarius_, &c.[211]\r\n\r\nThe following letters from Louis XI., from Lorenzo, and from Sixtus\r\nIV., relate to the famous Pazzi conspiracy when Giuliano de’ Medici was\r\nmurdered and Lorenzo wounded in the cathedral of Florence. Antagonism\r\nand rivalry had for some time existed between the two great families,\r\nalthough Lorenzo’s favourite sister Bianca was married to Gugliemo de’\r\nPazzi, who had been regarded by Piero almost as his own son, and is\r\noften mentioned in these letters as the companion of the Magnificent\r\non hunting excursions and visits to foreign courts. Gugliemo’s brother\r\nFrancesco, head of the Pazzi bank at Rome, worked incessantly against\r\nLorenzo’s uncle Giovanni Tornabuoni, manager of the Roman branch of the\r\nMedici bank, and eventually succeeded in depriving him of the business\r\nof the Holy See given to Lorenzo in the first days of Sixtus’ rule. The\r\nthird brother, Giovanni de’ Pazzi, was married to Beatrice Borromeo,\r\nwho on the death of her father without having made a will claimed,\r\naccording to the existing laws, the whole of his property. His nephews,\r\nhowever, intimate friends of the two young Medici, contested her right,\r\nand in 1476 a retrospective law of intestacy was passed setting aside\r\nthe claims of females to the estate of a father who died intestate,\r\nand giving it to the nearest male relative. Machiavelli, Nardi, and\r\nGuicciardini, all accuse Lorenzo of instigating the drafting of “this\r\nlaw made for the occasion,” as Nardi calls it. Roscoe maintains that it\r\nwas passed more than ten years before, but the proofs he adduces are\r\nquite illusory. Without extraneous aid it is however very improbable\r\nthat the Pazzi would have dared to attempt the assassination of the two\r\nbrothers Medici. This aid they obtained from the Pope. Sixtus IV. had,\r\nas Dr. Creighton says, “elevated nepotism into political principle ...\r\nhe took his nephews, men of no position and little capacity, and placed\r\nat their disposal all the resources of the Roman See.” Giuliano della\r\nRovere and Piero Riario were created cardinals in total disregard of\r\nthe regulations of the Conclave, while for Piero’s brother, Girolamo,\r\nhe bought Imola from the Duke of Milan, at the same time arranging\r\na marriage between him and Caterina Sforza, the Duke’s illegitimate\r\ndaughter. Florence had long coveted Imola, and Lorenzo tried to prevent\r\nthe purchase by raising difficulties about advancing the necessary\r\nmoney to the Pope. Francesco de’ Pazzi then seized his opportunity and\r\nwas appointed Treasurer to the Holy See in Lorenzo’s place.\r\n\r\nAnother grievance Sixtus had against Florence was the indirect aid\r\ngiven to Niccolò Vitelli, who had taken the side of Todi and Spoleto\r\nwhen they rose against the Pope, by despatching troops to Borgo San\r\nSepolcro when the Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere laid siege to Città\r\ndi Castello. The appointment of the anti-Medicean Francesco Salviati,\r\nas Archbishop of Pisa in the place of the late Filippo de’ Medici,\r\nin spite of a previous promise that no archbishop or bishop should\r\nbe appointed within Florentine territory save by the consent of the\r\nSignory of Florence, was deeply resented by Lorenzo. Though unable\r\nto prevent the nomination he succeeded in keeping Salviati out of\r\nhis archbishopric and consequently without his emoluments for three\r\nyears. In 1477 the Pope’s anger against Lorenzo rose to fever-heat.\r\nHe suspected, unjustly as it appears, that Florence had aided Carlo\r\nFortebraccio in his endeavour to seize Perugia. The attempt failed and\r\nFortebraccio overran the territory of Siena, which at once appealed to\r\nthe Pope and the King of Naples, at the same time arrogantly summoning\r\nFlorence to immediately recall the condottiere. Fortebraccio was in\r\nVenetian service, so the Florentines answered that they had nothing to\r\ndo with him and only wished he would keep quiet.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan, had further complicated\r\nmatters. Girolamo Riario was astute enough to realise that if the\r\nPope died, the change of government in Milan might expose him to the\r\nresentment of Florence, and determined to try and overthrow the Medici.\r\nFrancesco de’ Pazzi and Archbishop Salviati were easily persuaded to\r\njoin, but shrewd old Jacopo de’ Pazzi, who lived in Florence and knew\r\nthe hold the Medici had over the people, gave them no encouragement.\r\nPromises of foreign aid and the assurance of the assent of the Pope\r\nhowever at last won him over. An Abruzzese, Giovan Battista da\r\nMontesecco, a captain in the service of Girolamo Riario, was selected\r\nas a man to be trusted; his confession[212] is curious reading but\r\ntoo long to give _in extenso_. When he met Francesco de’ Pazzi in the\r\nArchbishop Salviati’s house at Rome he expressed grave doubts. “Have\r\na care, gentlemen, what you are undertaking. Florence is no small\r\nmatter, and Lorenzo, I hear, is very popular.” The Archbishop answered\r\nthat they knew better how it stood with Lorenzo, that it was their\r\naffair and he was only the instrument. Montesecco then asked what the\r\nPope would say, and was assured he hated Lorenzo and would follow\r\ntheir advice. Moreover he would receive the captain. Plans were then\r\ndiscussed. It was arranged that troops were to be held in readiness\r\nby Giovanni Francesco da Tolentino from Imola, Lorenzo Giustini from\r\nCittà di Castello, and Napoleone Orsini from Todi and Perugia, to enter\r\nFlorence as soon as the assassins had done their work. Soon afterwards\r\nMontesecco was summoned to the Vatican. “I will have no bloodshed,”\r\nsaid the Pope, “it is not consistent with my office to cause the death\r\nof any man. Lorenzo has behaved shamefully and iniquitously towards\r\nus, but I do not desire his death, though I do desire a change of\r\ngovernment.” Girolamo Riario promised that everything should be done to\r\nprevent bloodshed, but asked the Pope to pardon any man who was forced\r\nto commit murder. “Thou art a stupid fool,” answered the Pope. “I tell\r\nthee I will have no man killed, but I desire the government to be\r\nchanged. To you, Giovan Battista, I repeat that I wish the government\r\nof Florence to be changed and Lorenzo to be overthrown, for he is an\r\nundutiful and a bad man who defies us. When he is out of the way we\r\ncan deal as we choose with the Republic which will be most convenient\r\nto us.” Riario and the Archbishop agreed to this and added, “Then Your\r\nHoliness is content that we should take every means to bring this\r\nabout?” Sixtus repeated, “Again I say I am not. Go and do what you\r\nwill, as long as no blood is shed.” As they left Salviati turned to the\r\nPope, “Holy Father, are you content that we steer this boat. We will\r\nguide it well.” The Pope answered, “I am. But see to it that the honour\r\nof the Holy See and of the Count does not suffer.”\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop now went to Pisa, and Francesco de’ Pazzi to Florence.\r\nKnowing the hospitable nature of Lorenzo, he suggested that Raffaello\r\nSansoni, a nephew of Girolamo Riario (whose name he adopted), who had\r\njust been created Cardinal of S. Giorgio at the age of seventeen and\r\nwas studying at Pisa, should come to the Pazzi villa near Florence.\r\nAs he expected, the lad was at once invited to supper at the Medicean\r\nvilla at Fiesole, and the conspirators were jubilant. But Giuliano\r\nwas ill and did not come, so they were foiled. The young Cardinal,\r\nsimply an instrument in the hands of the Pazzi and the Archbishop,\r\nthen expressed a desire to see the Medici palace in town, and proposed\r\nthe Sunday before Ascension day (26th April), when he was to celebrate\r\nHigh Mass in the cathedral. Lorenzo asked him to dine afterwards, and\r\nit was arranged that the two Medici brothers were to be killed as they\r\nrose from table. It is singular that no rumour of the plot had got\r\nabroad, as so many were cognisant of it. Besides Jacopo and Francesco\r\nde’ Pazzi, the Archbishop and Montesecco, there was Jacopo Salviati,\r\nthe Archbishop’s brother, and his cousin another Jacopo, Bernardo\r\nBandini, a dissipated adventurer, and Jacopo Bracciolini, son of Poggio\r\nBracciolini the humanist, who owed much to the Medici. Jacopo was\r\ndeeply in debt and inordinately vain. Two priests, destined to play a\r\nprominent part, were also implicated, Antonio Maffei of Volterra, an\r\nApostolic scribe, and Stefano da Bagnone, chaplain to Jacopo de’ Pazzi.\r\nMontesecco had hired a band of Perugian exiles, and the Archbishop had\r\na large retinue; these were to aid in seizing the Palazzo de’ Signori.\r\nAt the last moment Giuliano sent word that he was not well enough to\r\ndine, but would attend Mass. The conspirators then determined that\r\nthe deed must be done in the cathedral, as on that evening Tolentino\r\nand Giustini would be drawing near to Florence with their troops.\r\nFrancesco de’ Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini undertook to kill Giuliano,\r\nLorenzo was entrusted to the abler hands of Montesecco. No doubt\r\nall would have gone as they had planned but for the scruples of the\r\nsoldier, who absolutely refused to commit a murder “where God would see\r\nhim.” The two priests, who had no such feeling, offered themselves as\r\nsubstitutes--and failed.\r\n\r\nLorenzo accompanied the Cardinal and the Archbishop, who had come to\r\nFlorence on the pretext of seeing his invalid mother, to the cathedral.\r\nSuddenly the conspirators saw that Giuliano had not come. Francesco de’\r\nPazzi and Bernardo Bandini ran across the square and persuaded him\r\nto go with them, affectionately clasping their arms round him to feel\r\nwhether he wore a shirt of mail.\r\n\r\nThe scene in the cathedral is best described in the words of Filippo\r\nStrozzi, who was present: “At the words _missa est_ Ser Stefano da\r\nBagnone, secretary of Messer Jacopo de’ Pazzi and Messer Antonio Maffei\r\nof Volterra assailed Lorenzo de’ Medici, while Francesco de’ Pazzi\r\nand Bernardo Bandini fell upon Giuliano. Both were walking round the\r\nchoir outside, and Lorenzo at once understood, drew his sword, leaped\r\ninto the choir, rushed across in front of the altar, entered the new\r\nsacristy and ordered the door to be locked. There he remained until aid\r\ncame from his house. He was only wounded in the neck, and in a few days\r\nwas well. Francesco de’ Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini sprang at Giuliano,\r\nwho was walking in front of the chapel of the Cross, and with ten or\r\ntwelve blows laid him dead on the pavement; they also killed Francesco\r\nNori, who was with him. The uproar was great in the church. I was there\r\ntalking with Messer Bongianni and the other gentlemen, and we were all\r\nstruck with astonishment, people flying now here, now there, while the\r\nchurch resounded with loud shouts, and arms were seen in the hands of\r\npartisans of the Pazzi who had joined in this matter. The Cardinal was\r\nleft all alone by the side of the altar, until some priests came and\r\nled him into the old sacristy, where he remained until two of the Eight\r\nwith many soldiers arrived and took him to the Palace. At the time this\r\nwas happening the Archbishop of Pisa, under the pretence of paying a\r\nvisit to the Signory, was at the Palace, and hearing the tumult in\r\nthe city, he tried to seize it. With him was his brother Jacopo and\r\nJacopo his cousin, Jacopo Poggio, the Perugians, and others. But the\r\nSignory and their guard defended themselves and sounded the tocsin, and\r\nthe citizens rushed armed into the piazza, and forced a way into the\r\nPalace, the door of which had been closed on the inside, and all were\r\nmade prisoners.”\r\n\r\nPoliziano describes the agony of suspense of the small group in the new\r\nsacristy, who thought the church was in the hands of the Pazzi. “Some\r\nfeared that the priest’s dagger was poisoned, and Lorenzo’s friend,\r\nAntonio Ridolfi, a most excellent youth, sucked the wound in his neck.\r\nLorenzo, however, gave no heed to it, continually repeating, ‘Is\r\nGiuliano safe?’ Then came sharp knocks at the door. ‘We are friends,\r\nwe are relations. Let Lorenzo come out ere the enemy gains a foothold.’\r\nWe were undecided, and shouted, ‘Enemies or friends? Is Giuliano safe?’\r\nNo answer was given. Then Sigismondo Della Stufa, devoted to Lorenzo\r\nsince his boyhood, climbed up the ladders into the organ loft, looked\r\ndown into the church, and saw the dead body of Giuliano. He recognised\r\nthose below as friends, and shouted to us to open the door. Closing\r\naround Lorenzo we led him, so that he should not come past the dead\r\nbody, to his house.”\r\n\r\nHow the Archbishop of Pisa, the Pazzi, and Jacopo Bracciolini were\r\nhung from the windows of the Palace of the Signoria, and how the\r\npeople hunted their adherents through the streets, shouting, “_Palle!\r\nPalle! down with the traitors_ and cut them to pieces,” is a matter\r\nof history. Montesecco lay in hiding for some days, and before he was\r\nbeheaded in the Palazzo del Podestà, dictated and signed the confession\r\nwhich throws full light on the participation of Sixtus IV. and his\r\nnephew Girolamo Riario in the plot.\r\n\r\nOn Ascension Day Giuliano was buried in S. Lorenzo, amid the grief\r\nof the people whose darling he was. “He was tall,” writes Poliziano,\r\n“broad-shouldered, wide-chested, with well-developed and strong arms,\r\na small waist, powerful thighs, and well-made legs; black, sparkling\r\neyes, a dark complexion, with thick black hair falling on to his\r\nshoulders. A fine rider, jouster, and dancer, an excellent wrestler\r\nand runner, passionately devoted to the chase, submitting patiently\r\nto want of sleep, to hunger, and to thirst, which he often endured\r\nfor a whole day. Magnanimous, steady, pious, and without vice, he\r\ndelighted in music, painting, and everything connected with art. He\r\nliked poetry, and wrote some good verse in the vulgar tongue. He\r\nspoke well, but was reserved and not quick-witted; yet he enjoyed\r\na good joke, and sometimes made one. Liars he hated and those who\r\nnursed vengeance. In dress he was not extravagant, but always neat and\r\nwell-clothed. Serious, handsome, and dignified, he was most courteous\r\nand kind-hearted. He adored and revered his brother, while his courage\r\nand high spirits endeared him to the people.”\r\n\r\nVasari tells in his Life of Verrocchio of three waxen images of\r\nLorenzo, the size of life, made by order of his friends and relations\r\nto commemorate his escape from the dagger of the assassin by Arsino,\r\na celebrated worker in wax, with the help and after the designs\r\nof Verrocchio. “The skeleton inside was of wood, as has been said\r\nelsewhere, with a framework of split canes covered with waxed cloth in\r\nhandsome folds, so well arranged that nothing better or more lifelike\r\ncan be imagined. The heads, hands, and feet were made of thicker wax,\r\nhollow inside and copied from life, painted in oils, and ornamented\r\nwith hair and other necessary things, so natural and so well made, that\r\nthey seemed living men and not waxen images, as can be seen in any\r\nof these three. One of them is in the church of the nuns of Chiarito\r\nin Via S. Gallo in front of the miraculous crucifix. This figure is\r\nclothed in the very dress Lorenzo wore when, with his neck bandaged, he\r\nshowed himself at the window of his house to the people, who had rushed\r\nthere to see whether he was alive, as they hoped, or to avenge him\r\nif dead. The second figure of Lorenzo is clothed in the _lucco_, the\r\nordinary dress of the Florentines, and is in the church of the Servites\r\nof the Annunziata above the smaller door, beside which is the table\r\nwhere candles are sold. The third was sent to S. Maria degl’ Angeli at\r\nAssisi and placed in front of the Madonna, where, as has been already\r\nsaid, Lorenzo de’ Medici caused the road which goes from S. Maria to\r\nthe gate of Assisi and leads to S. Francesco to be laid down in bricks,\r\nand at the same time restored the fountains built by his grandfather\r\nCosimo at the same place.”[213]\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis XI., _King of France, to the_ Florentine Republic\r\n\r\n Beloved and great Friends,--We have just heard of the great and\r\n inhuman outrage, opprobrium and injury, which not long ago has been\r\n committed against your Seigneury, against the persons of our most dear\r\n and beloved cousins Lorenzo and Giuliano de’ Medici, their friends,\r\n relations, servants, and adherents, by those of the Pazzi Bank and\r\n their dependants; and of the death of our said cousin Giuliano de’\r\n Medici, whereby we have been and are as much grieved as though it\r\n had happened to ourselves. Now as your honour and our own has been\r\n so gravely offended, and as the Medici are our relations and allies,\r\n and as we regard this outrage and the death of our cousin Giuliano\r\n as though it had happened to our own person, and therefore consider\r\n the Pazzi guilty of _læsæ Majestatis_, we cannot permit this deed to\r\n go unpunished; we desire with all our heart that adequate punishment\r\n should follow as an example to others. We have therefore decided to\r\n send to your Excellencies our well-beloved and faithful Councillor and\r\n Chamberlain, Messire d’Argenton,[214] Seneschal of our province of\r\n Poitou, who is one of the men in whom we have the utmost confidence,\r\n to inform you at length of our wishes; he will tell you more about\r\n this matter. We beg you to place the same trust in him and the same\r\n belief in his words as you would in ours, it is for this that we send\r\n him. I pray God, beloved and great friends, to keep and to guard\r\n you.--12th May 1478.[215]\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis XI. _to_ Pope Sixtus IV.\r\n\r\n_Copy of our Letter sent to the Pope_\r\n\r\n Most Holy Father,--We have been fully informed that wantonly by the\r\n hands of Count Girolamo, of one of your nephews recently promoted to\r\n the dignity of the Cardinalate, of the Archbishop of Pisa, and of\r\n members of the Pazzi family and their adherents, an outrage, insult,\r\n and personal attack has been made on the person of our dear friend\r\n Lorenzo de’ Medici and on Giuliano his brother. That the said Giuliano\r\n and others, his friends, have been killed, murdered, and assassinated\r\n in a church in Florence, in which we have been. We are deeply grieved\r\n and still more astonished that such an outrage should have been\r\n committed against one of such a House as is that of the Medici;\r\n renowned in the whole world, and known as belonging to the Church\r\n and filling high offices, such as that of Cardinal and Archbishop,\r\n and in the precincts of a Church, a sacred place dedicated to God.\r\n Therefore, Holy Father, we are much displeased at so abominable a sin\r\n and outrage, which we regard as even more grave than if it had been\r\n done to our own person, or to the person of one nearly related to us,\r\n and we hold that your and our honour has been most deeply offended.\r\n On account of the special love we have always borne, and bear, to\r\n the said Lorenzo our cousin and to all of his House, and of the\r\n great friendship, cemented by loyalty, oaths, and alliance, which in\r\n past times existed, and exists at present, between our predecessors,\r\n ourselves, and the city of Florence, we most affectionately supplicate\r\n and pray Your Holiness that for love of us as well as for love of our\r\n Holy Mother Church, in order that others should not go unpunished,\r\n amends shall be made for this crime by punishing the delinquents,\r\n and all who have aided and participated, in such way that it may be\r\n an example for all men to remember, and that greater ills shall not\r\n arise. Otherwise, by virtue of the said alliance and confederation\r\n existing between us and the said Florentines, and on account of\r\n the love we bear to our said cousin, we have determined to declare\r\n against all those who are implicated and not to allow this thing to go\r\n unpunished. We pray the Blessed Son of God that Your Holiness may long\r\n be spared to rule our Holy Mother Church.[216]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Tommaso Soderini _at Milan_[217]\r\n\r\n I wrote to you on the 8th. Since then I have received yours of the\r\n 6th, to which I now reply. I thought it best to send the last by a\r\n special courier, because I have heard that the troops of the King\r\n [of Naples] and of the Pope intend making a serious attack, so I\r\n think it will be necessary to gather a larger force here than we had\r\n asked for, as when the enemy comes he will probably come in force.\r\n By yours and Orfeo’s letters we understand that 1000 men have been\r\n engaged and are ready for our service. If this is correct I think it\r\n will suffice if one half crosses our frontier, the rest being held in\r\n readiness for what I mentioned in my last, the assault of Imola. It\r\n must be remembered that in defending ourselves we are defending those\r\n Illustrious Lords [of Milan], and if we gain anything for ourselves\r\n it will be most unexpected, for these Venetian ambassadors declare\r\n that if peace is not made with the Turk we can hope for but small aid\r\n from them. In ten or twelve days we shall have 450 men under arms. If\r\n there is a chance of engaging any condottieri it would be an excellent\r\n thing. I think I am sure of Signor Costanzo and do not believe he will\r\n fail me. Those Illustrious Lords have written to their ambassador\r\n here that they will only subscribe 8000 ducats towards the pay of the\r\n Romagna troop. It seems to me they do wrong to state a given sum, as\r\n this might put off the Venetians, if they say they will subscribe one\r\n third for this troop it can afterwards be settled between ourselves\r\n that we should pay whatever sum is needful beyond the 8000 ducats.\r\n Those Illustrious Lords also seem not to wish to engage Signor\r\n Costanzo, as I heard yesterday. But the negotiation is so far advanced\r\n that not only would it be most unjust to him, but also my motive in\r\n hindering him from serving with the enemy must be considered. If he\r\n only guards and defends his own territory it seems to me it would be\r\n a great advantage to us. In short these gentlemen must be prepared to\r\n disburse the above-mentioned sum and the troops must be ready to move\r\n as I have said. Above all there must be no delay, as our adversaries\r\n are hastening their preparations; if they see that we are strong and\r\n able to resist they may change their minds. From the Venetians I do\r\n not think we shall get other help than those few men on this side of\r\n the Po and their contribution towards the pay of the Romagna troop,\r\n which they appear to give willingly.\r\n\r\n Letters from Rome show that although the Pope knows that Cardinal\r\n Riario has been set at liberty, he shows no disposition to raise the\r\n excommunication or the interdict.[218] This is a bad sign and makes\r\n one believe that he will do all in his power to injure us. We shall\r\n see what will happen and are determined to defend ourselves as well as\r\n we can.\r\n\r\n Girolamo left to-day. He came by way of Pontremoli; I reminded him\r\n of your business and he promised me to do all he could. If you pass\r\n through Ferrara I need not tell you what to say to the Duke to keep\r\n him in the same friendly mood towards us he now displays. I say no\r\n more because I know these ambassadors are writing at length.--June 10,\r\n 1478.[219]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Giovanni Lanfredini, _Florentine Ambassador at\r\nVenice_\r\n\r\n I received yours of the 6th this morning and should have waited for\r\n another letter from you with the answer of the Signoria [of Venice],\r\n but from various sources I have heard that the forces of the King and\r\n the Pope are marching to attack us, and so I write at once in order\r\n that you may hasten any aid we can get from Venice. Our ambassador\r\n there will I think send our opinion _in scriptis_ to the Signoria,\r\n who will have to consult with him. We have need of more men than\r\n those who are on this side of the Po. If the Signoria approve of our\r\n plan of attacking Imola in case war is declared against us, we should\r\n prefer that the above-mentioned men should be employed there. If they\r\n do not approve, then it is imperative that the men be sent with all\r\n haste to guard our territory, and we will give orders that they are\r\n to be allowed to cross our frontier. We are most anxious about this,\r\n not on account of the number of men, but in order to prove to our\r\n adversaries that we are united, for they count much on our disunion.\r\n Try therefore to settle this one way or the other and reply quickly,\r\n for the affair is _in fieri_, and at any moment some impediment might\r\n arise. The Signoria of Venice intimated that they did not believe the\r\n Pope and the King intend to advance; now I conceive they understand it\r\n is true. We have set the Cardinal at liberty, but the Pope has shown\r\n no sign of taking off the excommunications or the interdicts; on the\r\n contrary he maintains them and encourages troops to attack us. So this\r\n is no time for loitering. It would be most harmful to us if their\r\n ambassador left here before his successor was appointed. We wish this\r\n also to be seen to at once. I will have a copy of the deliberations of\r\n the last council sent to you in order that you may press these matters\r\n with all the tact demanded by the customs there and by the questions\r\n themselves.\r\n\r\n I wrote thus far yesterday evening. Afterwards we of the _Pratica_\r\n met, and it was decided not to send our opinions _in scriptis_, but\r\n to await the reply to those we have sent. More particularly as our\r\n opinion is as follows. On all sides we perceive signs of incertitude\r\n and hesitation in spite of our solicitations to grant us what they\r\n can. If this was cleared up we might hope. If the Venetians will only\r\n make a demonstration in our favour, with small cost to themselves\r\n they would do us a great service, because, as I have already said,\r\n our adversaries believe we are not unanimous in our desire to defend\r\n ourselves, and this makes them more enterprising. We thought at\r\n least that we should receive help which cost little, as for example\r\n in the affair of submission [to the Pope], particularly as these\r\n ecclesiastical censures still continue, and so that the Signoria must\r\n either incur the same interdict if they help us, or break faith with\r\n us, which however would be absolved by the Bull of the interdict. As I\r\n said before, discover what we can hope for from there, in order that\r\n I may not be again deceived. Present these questions skilfully so as\r\n not to cause any friction; rather leave a part unsaid, for our great\r\n object is to maintain the union of our League in appearance and in\r\n reality.\r\n\r\n I am writing to our envoy [Tommaso Soderini], who I do not think\r\n can have arrived. If he has, lay everything before him.--June 10,\r\n 1478.[220]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Louis XI., _King of France_\r\n\r\n Most Serene King and especially my Lord,--The letter Your Majesty has\r\n deigned to write about our unhappy case, replete with great love and\r\n paternal benevolence, shows me how keenly you felt our misfortune,\r\n and how kindly disposed you are towards me. Should I even attempt to\r\n return adequate thanks to Your Majesty I should deserve to be called\r\n utterly unfit to understand so great a benefit, because words so full\r\n of love and benevolence coming from Your Majesty to a humble servant\r\n cannot be repaid by any act or word. I can therefore only beg Your\r\n Majesty specially to accept my heartfelt declaration of loyalty as a\r\n token and a pledge of my gratitude, trusting that God will repay to\r\n Your Majesty the rest of my debt. As to Your Majesty’s wise counsels\r\n to bear this calamity with fortitude, you may rest assured that I do\r\n not so much deplore what has happened to myself as the grave affront\r\n to the Christian name; because where I hoped, in such bitter trouble,\r\n to receive help, I found instead the fountain-head and instigator\r\n of all ill. For he, in the presence of many, dared to confess\r\n spontaneously that this crime was caused by him, and promulgated\r\n against me, my children, successors, intimates, and well-wishers, an\r\n iniquitous sentence of excommunication. Not satisfied with that, he is\r\n arming against this Republic, has instigated King Ferdinand against\r\n us, and has urged the King’s eldest son to march against us with a\r\n formidable army in order with violence and arms to destroy him he\r\n could not succeed in utterly ruining by deceit and fraud. For I well\r\n know, and God is my witness, that I have committed no crime against\r\n the Pope, save that I am alive, and having been protected by the grace\r\n of Almighty God have not allowed myself to be murdered. This is my\r\n sin, for this alone have I been excommunicated and massacred. But I\r\n believe that God, scrutiniser of hearts and most just Judge, who knows\r\n my innocence, will not permit this and will defend me, whom He saved\r\n from those sacrilegious hands in front of His Body, from such unjust\r\n calumny. On our side we have Canon Law, on our side laws natural and\r\n political, on our side truth and innocence, on our side God and men.\r\n He has violated all these at once, and now desires to annihilate us. I\r\n write these things to Your Majesty as to a compassionate father, and\r\n from you, on account of your goodness, piety, and greatness of soul,\r\n I have no doubt I shall receive much help, favour, and military aid,\r\n if required. For we cannot believe that any good man can tolerate that\r\n he, who wilfully precipitates himself into such an abyss of crime,\r\n should drag with him the Christian name. May Your Majesty keep well,\r\n to whom I humbly commend myself--Florence, June 19, 1478.[221]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Sforza de’ Bettini\r\n\r\n Sforzie de Bettinis,--I wrote to you this morning. Later I received\r\n yours of the 28th, with news of the arrival of the Duke of Calabria\r\n and the others at Todi. We wrote at once to all our troops, save to\r\n those who are already there, to unite and join those of the Duchess\r\n [of Milan] with all speed, part are in the Pisan territory, the others\r\n are on the march; to Giovanni Conti [one of the Milanese generals],\r\n telling him to advance into the territory of Bologna; to the Venetian\r\n contingent to come into that of Faenza. All the others are to march\r\n on Todi. We have asked for two hundred additional men-at-arms from\r\n Milan besides those that are in readiness, and said that these two\r\n hundred are to be placed at once in our pay. With this letter is sent\r\n the number of men and the names of the places where they are, so that\r\n you can direct them wherever you think best. We have thus done all we\r\n can for the moment. You must try and obtain more certain information\r\n whether what you have written is true or not. If not, you ought not\r\n to lack means to discover the dealings and intentions of the enemy. I\r\n think that among them are several who would willingly do us a service.\r\n If you can contrive to interview the Cavaliere I think you might learn\r\n something. Make every effort, for I cannot believe that you are unable\r\n to defend so just a cause.\r\n\r\n I understand that the Lord Giovanfrancesco has given orders that the\r\n troops he is to send are to be paid, which will be so much more money.\r\n I am astonished that the Lord Virginio [Orsini, Clarice’s brother]\r\n should give them an escort after replying as he did to that trumpeter,\r\n however I do not think, as I said this morning, that we need despair.\r\n I have no more to add save that you must send us frequent news, and\r\n as true news as you can, and use every means to discover as much as\r\n possible of the movements and intentions of our adversaries. If this\r\n arrival of the Duke of Calabria is true it will probably alter the\r\n plans about which we wrote this morning, and we think it will be\r\n necessary to concentrate our forces as you suggested. Farewell--June\r\n 25, 1478.[222]\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Ceccho, _from Milan, to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice tanquam Pater honorande_,--To yours of the 28th of last\r\n month in reply to mine of the 22nd, I will only refer by thanking Your\r\n Magnificence for accepting my letter in good part.\r\n\r\n As to the Lord of Forli it would seem to me wise to make every effort\r\n to draw him to our side for the honour, advantage, and reputation of\r\n our League; the said Lord is clever, and I think, as Your Magnificence\r\n says, he will attempt to get as much money as he can from the Pope,\r\n and then _cum sua justificatione_ withdraw: I have lived for many\r\n years with these lords of Romagna and know their nature, but one\r\n cannot count on this, and we must do all we can to get him on our side.\r\n\r\n Monsignore de Chiaromonte (Clermont), ambassador of the King of\r\n France,[223] has been here, my Illustrious Masters showed him\r\n great honour, and this morning he left: the Illustrious Madonna\r\n and we counsellors spoke to him with much openness, and gave him\r\n to understand that in favour of that Republic and of Yourself my\r\n Illustrious Masters will give all the aid this State can _usque ad\r\n vitam_, and we spoke thus as freely as possible, in order that he\r\n might understand that this State was _unum velle et unum nolle_ with\r\n yours. He seemed to me a worthy man, and one to be cultivated; this I\r\n advise you to do, and to send to meet him without delay at Bologna,\r\n and do what my Masters have written to their ambassador there and this\r\n quickly, so that you may be in time.\r\n\r\n It seems to me useless to enlarge on other things, only I beg Your\r\n Magnificence to take heed of your person and to be of good cheer,\r\n because I think there is every indication that things are going well,\r\n and that the Republic, our League, and Your Magnificence, will gain in\r\n reputation; on this side we shall leave nothing undone.\r\n\r\n I beg Your Magnificence not to allow the letters my Illustrious\r\n Masters have written, or mine about affairs with the King of France,\r\n go into any other hands, but to deliver them there to Monsignore\r\n d’Argenton,[224] with the circumspection and prudence that I know\r\n Your Magnificence possesses, and thus we shall arrive at obtaining,\r\n between my Masters and H.M. the King of France, the essence of what\r\n is contained in those letters, which will redound to your honour,\r\n reputation, and advantage, because our League being strong and united,\r\n and helped by the friendship and reputation of France, things cannot\r\n but go well.\r\n\r\n Yesterday morning I obtained possession of some letters from France\r\n written by one Lancilotto of Macedonia to King Ferrante. We find that\r\n King Ferrante has at present four of his people at the French court,\r\n this same Lancilotto, Zohan Copula of Salerno, Tommaso Tarquino, who\r\n resides there, and a Messer Antonio de Alexandro, only just arrived\r\n by the route of Catalonia with instructions and mandates of divers\r\n intrigues and plots. I have informed Hieronimo Morelli, ambassador of\r\n their excellencies the Signoria [of Florence] of all, so that he may\r\n write to Your Magnificence, and I am sure he will have done so. I do\r\n not enlarge on this point, because I am sure you will understand and\r\n form a better judgment than I can. I entreat of you to keep my letters\r\n in your own custody and in that of no other man, for I would on no\r\n account that our ambassadors or others should see them for certain\r\n reasons, which are legitimate, to avoid rancour, envy, and calumny,\r\n &c.--Milan, July 3, 1478.[225]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Messer Giovanni di Bentivoglio _at Milan_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice vir_,--By your letter of the 1st I see what the Lord of\r\n Forlì has answered. I cannot understand how this difficulty has\r\n arisen, and it is unreasonable. His stipend at present is 8000 ducats,\r\n so he ought to be satisfied with 20,000. Perhaps he does not wish to\r\n serve and tries to throw the blame on us. If this is so I do not see\r\n what his object is in behaving thus. We will not give more than 20,000\r\n ducats with the title of governor of the camp, and the protection of\r\n our League. I have sent again to offer him this, as I had a hint that\r\n he would accept. If he does it will be well, if not I shall cut short\r\n the negotiation, and we will not mention the matter again.\r\n\r\n I understand from letters from the Illustrious Lords of Milan that\r\n they encourage Your Magnificence to take steps to obtain the recall of\r\n the Legate. This seems to me perfectly justifiable, our League being\r\n no longer in any way bound to obey the Pope. His presence can only\r\n be harmful and a cause of suspicion. As I am writing I must say that\r\n I heartily approve the advice of those Illustrious Princes and think\r\n Your Magnificence would do well to get rid of the Legate for your own\r\n good and for your reputation, and in order not to appear reluctant in\r\n following the advice of those Illustrious Lords and the wishes of our\r\n Illustrious League. You will gain in credit and security. I commend\r\n myself, &c.--July 4, 1478.[226]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Girolamo Morelli, _Florentine Ambassador at\r\nMilan_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice orator tanquam Pater_,--Your letter of the 11th tells me\r\n many things to which I now reply. First, if you do not receive news\r\n day by day the only reason is that I have so much to do that it is\r\n difficult for me to be exact, not to speak of my own dilatory nature.\r\n But I will make every effort to inform you of essential matters every\r\n day. I will do all I can and even a little more.\r\n\r\n I understand what the Magnificent Messer Ceccho and Orfeo told you,\r\n and with regard to the affair of Messer Ruberto am exceedingly sorry\r\n that by no fault of mine they and I have such perpetual annoyance\r\n and vexation. Your answer was wise and true. In this business I have\r\n never thought or done anything without first referring to them.\r\n Whether these ambassadors, who have written what I never charged\r\n them to write, have stated the truth I know not. As soon as I heard\r\n the news, and that at Bologna they doubted whether Signor Ruberto’s\r\n father-in-law would give this money, I wrote to Messer Giovanni and\r\n sent you the copy, and I showed these ambassadors the admirable reply\r\n made by Signor Giovanni. Thus those Illustrious Lords will see that\r\n from that moment, for this and many other reasons, Signor Ruberto was\r\n the enemy of those Illustrious Lords, as he was mine. I desire to\r\n clear this matter up once for all and to settle it, for added to all\r\n my other worries it is too much for me to bear.\r\n\r\n As to Signor Taddeo we are quite willing to do as you say, but as yet\r\n we have not settled with the Lord of Forlì, as he demands more than we\r\n can well give. We were willing to pay him 25,000 ducats and to give\r\n him the title of Captain-General of our forces. Now he wants double\r\n in time of war, besides making many other dishonest demands. We are\r\n willing to grant anything he asks when he is employed in fighting\r\n outside of Romagna, but not otherwise, and are expecting his answer.\r\n If he does not accept we shall break off negotiations, as we should\r\n lose in money and in reputation. Once this is settled we can treat\r\n with Signor Taddeo, to whom I will write in the meanwhile and find out\r\n what he wants. He is now secretly in Bologna.\r\n\r\n We have replied in general terms to King René’s mandate, as he wrote\r\n to us. But privately we have given him to understand that events may\r\n take a course favourable to his designs. I am sure that if the League\r\n decides to undertake anything in that quarter what we have done here\r\n concerning his mandate will be of service to him. I think he intends\r\n to return by Milan in order to see Messer Ceccho, at least so he\r\n wrote to me, and I advised him to do so. From what we hear from the\r\n camp the enemy makes no sign of life. If they do not receive strong\r\n reinforcements, or hopes of some treaty, I think they will do us\r\n little harm. But you had better hurry our contingent there, for whom\r\n you have the money, and see that they are ready and fit to march;\r\n though we hope even without them soon to be as strong as the enemy\r\n is at present. Let us know if our contingent from Brescia has passed\r\n through, they ought to arrive soon.\r\n\r\n We had told Signor Giovanni Conte to come here; but he probably left\r\n this morning for the camp as Giovanni di Sapone and Messer Alberto\r\n Visconti are both ill, so he was wanted. His men are following to join\r\n the others. When necessary to send all to him we can do it from here\r\n ...[227] meanwhile those who are ill may recover. But it is absolutely\r\n essential to arrange about a Captain-General who is much needed,\r\n although until now there is perfect order and unity in the camp.\r\n\r\n You already know from others my desire about Genoese affairs, and that\r\n I do not think other matters should be imperilled for them. I know\r\n it was unnecessary, but I cannot have done wrong in saying what I\r\n thought. I am still of the same opinion that other people should not\r\n be placed in a dangerous position unless one is sure of success.\r\n\r\n The Office has I believe written to you as to the affairs of the camp\r\n and of Montepulciano, as well as about a Brief from the Pope and the\r\n answer to it, so I say no more. I commend myself to you.--Florence,\r\n July 15, 1478.\r\n\r\n                                             Laurentius de Medicis.[228]\r\n\r\n\r\nSixtus IV. _to the_ Duke Federigo _of Urbino_\r\n\r\n _Carissime fili noster at affinis salutem et Apostolicam\r\n benedictionem_,--We have received your letter written _manu propria_\r\n and were rejoiced to hear your health was good, which is what I\r\n desire above all things and for which I pray to God, for nothing is\r\n more desirable to us. The letter written by the Florentines, full of\r\n contempt of Christ and of His unworthy Vicar does not alarm us, but\r\n causes us to think that God has destroyed their intellect and their\r\n judgment as a punishment for their sins. We trust that God, whose\r\n honour and glory is at stake, will grant you victory in everything,\r\n especially as our intentions are straightforward and just. For we\r\n make war on no one save on that ungrateful, excommunicated, and\r\n heretical Lorenzo de’ Medici; and we pray to God to punish him for his\r\n iniquitous acts, and to you as God’s minister deputed to avenge the\r\n wrongs he has iniquitously and without cause committed against God and\r\n His Church, with such ingratitude that the fountain of infinite love\r\n has been dried up.\r\n\r\n To the Venetians we have replied in proper terms that if they act\r\n unjustly God is above all, and will requite every one according to his\r\n acts.\r\n\r\n We have sent many Nuncios with our justification to the King of France\r\n and to other princes, such as the Emperor, the Kings of Hungary and\r\n Spain, and all the others.\r\n\r\n Moreover our Bull which has been printed and published to the whole\r\n world will justify us; but allowing that everything goes wrong we\r\n shall rejoice in dying as a martyr and hear every persecution for\r\n love of the Church of God of which we are the unworthy head. We are\r\n sure that when you reflect on what merit you will acquire before God\r\n for defending His Church you will act as a true Christian Prince, and\r\n that my son the Duke of Calabria, together with yourself, will obtain\r\n glory with God and men; the Church will support you who support a just\r\n cause, &c. I am told that some, from ignorance or malignity, depict\r\n me as of hell; this I do not refute, but only despise their words,\r\n confiding in thy fidelity who wilt not abandon God and me, who trust\r\n in thee, so I let who will talk.\r\n\r\n These French ambassadors are, they say, coming to us, let us hope that\r\n God may inspire us with suitable answers, all which shall be notified\r\n to you. Salute my illustrious son the Duke of Calabria cordially from\r\n me. For him, as for you, we pray continually to God. I wish thee good\r\n health, most beloved cousin.--July 25, 1478.\r\n\r\n They threaten schism and disobedience.

I do not expect they will be\r\n wanted because, as I said, I think all the ill that could be done to\r\n me there has been done, and till now I have been able to provide for\r\n everything. Yet, for my own tranquillity I should like to know this,\r\n and I have not the least fear that it will be refused.

I have in Rome Antonio and the\r\n Portinari, nevertheless I confide this to you alone, and have written\r\n with my own hand in order that none should know. I wish, as I said,\r\n that you should arrange this with Messer Ceccho without either he or\r\n you conferring with others. I shall be able to face the many troubles\r\n I have with much more courage if I know that I can count on this help.\r\n If I do need it I will give every obligation and bond.--In Florence on\r\n the 25th July 1478.\r\n\r\n                                           Your Lorenzo de’ Medici.[231]\r\n\r\nIn 1478, after the Pazzi conspiracy, when the Pope was stirring up war\r\nagainst the Medici he hated, Lorenzo sent his wife and children to\r\nPistoja, where they were the guests of the Panciaticchi, for safety.\r\nWith them went Angelo Poliziano as tutor to Piero the eldest boy,\r\nthen about six years of age. The stiff, proud Roman, Madonna Clarice,\r\nhad never known how to gain her husband’s love, and did not get on\r\nwell with his brilliant, sarcastic, rather Bohemian friends. She\r\nparticularly disliked Poliziano’s growing influence over Piero, and\r\nat the end of the year there was an open rupture, when she dismissed\r\nhim with scant courtesy. One pities them both. Clarice, already far\r\ngone in consumption, was irritable and anxious about her husband,\r\nwhose attitude towards the Holy See she, with her education, could not\r\napprove; while Poliziano, used to the brilliant talk in the Medici\r\npalace, where he measured his wit with Luigi Pulci, Matteo Franco,\r\nMarsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, &c., and Lorenzo himself, was\r\nbored to death and always longing to be back in Florence. The letters\r\nfrom the little boy to his father show how simple was the family life\r\nof the Magnificent Lorenzo, indeed he is blamed by Machiavelli for\r\njoining in childish games with his children and for being seen playing\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _at Pistoja to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici _in Florence_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice mi patrone_,--I hope and trust Your Magnificence has not\r\n been disturbed by my letter written this morning under the influence\r\n of anger; the want of patience is my great fault. I hope in _bonam\r\n partem acceperis rebusque nostris prospectum curabis_.\r\n\r\n Madonna Clarice sends you three pheasants and a partridge. She says\r\n you are to beware as though they came from an enemy because she does\r\n not know the man who brought them; he is the father of your Pisan\r\n courier who broke his leg.\r\n\r\n By the bearer I send you the opinion of Messer Bartolommeo Sozzino.\r\n Every hour I have been entreating him to finish it and found a copyist\r\n who made all the haste he could, but it was impossible to get it done\r\n quicker.[232]\r\n\r\n Piero is well and I take every care of him, all the others are also in\r\n good health; but I get all the kicks; yet _te propter Libyeæ_.[233]\r\n I am longing for news that the plague has ceased on account of my\r\n anxiety for you and in order to return and serve you; for I hoped and\r\n I thought to be with you; but as you have, or rather my evil fortune\r\n has assigned to me this post in the service of Your Magnificence, I\r\n endure it, _quamvis durum, nec levius fit patientia_. I commend myself\r\n to Your Magnificence.--Pistoja, August 24, 1478.[234]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _at Pistoja to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice mi Domine_, &c.,--Madonna Clarice is well and so are all\r\n the others. Here we knew nothing of the tumult until the bearer of\r\n this gave me Franco’s[235] letter and calmed our fears which were\r\n aroused by his former one; Madonna Clarice suspected that things were\r\n more serious and that you _de industria_ made light of them. So now\r\n she is comforted _et acquievit_. We want for nothing; only we grieve\r\n sorely over your worries, which are of a truth great. God will help\r\n us. _Spes enim in vivis est, desperatis mortui._\r\n\r\n If you have not absolute need of Giovanni Tornabuoni Madonna Clarice\r\n wishes you would send him here, she is lonely without him, and for\r\n many reasons she thinks it would be well if he came.\r\n\r\n I look after Piero and incite him to write; in a few days I think he\r\n will write to you in a fashion that will astonish you, we have here a\r\n master that teaches writing in fifteen days, he is excellent at his\r\n trade. The children play about more than usual and are in splendid\r\n health. God help them and you. Piero never leaves me or I him. I wish\r\n I had to serve you in some greater thing, but as this has fallen to\r\n my lot I do it willingly. _Rogo tamen, ut aliquid aut literarum aut\r\n nuntii huc perlatum ivi cures, desque operam, ne quidquid est in me\r\n auctoritatis, patriaris exolescere, quo et puerum facilius in officio\r\n teneam, et meo munere, ut par est defungar. Sed hæc si commodum; fin\r\n minus, quod fors feret, feremus æquo animo._ Be of good cheer and take\r\n courage, for great men are formed by adversity. _Durate, et vosmet\r\n rebus servate secundis._ I commend myself to you.--Pistoja, August 26,\r\n 1478.

Pol.[236]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _at Pistoja to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice mi Domine_,--All the family here are well. Piero studies\r\n but little, every day we go out enjoying the country. We visit the\r\n gardens of which the town is full, and sometimes the library of\r\n Maestro Zambino, in which I have found several good things, both\r\n in Greek and in Latin. Giovanni is on his pony all the day, and\r\n all the people run after him. Mona Clarice is very well; but takes\r\n little pleasure in aught save any good news we get from Florence.\r\n She rarely goes out. We want for nothing. Presents we refuse, save\r\n salad, figs, and a few flasks of wine, some _beccafichi_ or things of\r\n that sort. These citizens would bring us water in their ears. From\r\n Andrea Panciaticchi we have received so much kindness that we are all\r\n indebted to him. We keep good watch and have begun to put a guard at\r\n the gates. Be of good cheer and conquer; and when you have time come\r\n and see your family who expect you with open arms. I commend myself to\r\n Your Magnificence.--Pistoja, August 31, 1478.[237]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _at Pistoja to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici _at Florence_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice Domine mi_,--Madonna Clarice has not felt very well since\r\n yesterday evening.... Piero went out to meet the Lord[238] this\r\n morning, and was the first to greet him. He spoke a few words of the\r\n sentence you wrote for him very well, and the Lord set him on his\r\n horse before him and thus entered Pistoja. Mona Clarice sent him a\r\n fine bunch of partridges, and this evening we all go to visit him at\r\n twenty-two of the clock, it being now nineteen. Giovanni Tornabuoni\r\n was with Piero and finished his little speech. Judging from what\r\n his people say, the Illustrious Lord is most anxious to do himself\r\n honour and to satisfy the Most Excellent Signoria and especially Your\r\n Magnificence.\r\n\r\n Clarice sends you I know not how many partridges of those given to her\r\n to present to this Lord. I shall see how things go and as in duty\r\n bound shall inform Your Magnificence, whom God preserve. I commend\r\n myself to you.--Pistoja, September 7, 1478.\r\n\r\n                                                        Agnolo Pol.[239]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _at Pistoja to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n My letters cannot but be acceptable to you, for I only write to give\r\n you news of your family. All, by the grace of God, are well; Piero\r\n continues to learn to write and will soon be so good a penman that I\r\n hope he will relieve me of the trouble of writing _sine argumento_ as\r\n I do now to you, so that I am ashamed of myself. But may it please God\r\n that I shall always have to write the same words to you, which are\r\n that we are all well. Madonna Clarice is much happier and better in\r\n health. We keep good guard and watch here, but we are anxious about\r\n you. God keep you, for it seems to me that all depends upon that. Have\r\n no fear about us, for we are very careful. As far as I am concerned\r\n neither care nor goodwill shall be wanting. I know how much I owe to\r\n Your Magnificence, and the love I bear to Piero and to your other\r\n children is hardly second to your own. If anything unpleasant and\r\n unkind does sometimes happen I shall endeavour to bear it for love of\r\n you, _cum omnia debeo_. I commend myself to you.--Pistoja, September\r\n 20, 1478.\r\n\r\n                                                  Agnolo Poliziano.[240]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici (_born 1472_) _to his father_ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice Pater mi_, &c.,--I write this letter to tell you we are\r\n well, and although I do not as yet know how to write well, I will\r\n do what I can. I shall try hard to do better in the future. I have\r\n already learnt many verses of Virgil, and I know nearly the whole\r\n of the first book of Theodoro by heart;[241] I think I understand it.\r\n The master makes me decline and examines me every day.

Now either he or\r\n another will go to you with this: because I wish to know how you and\r\n Lorenzo are, and the others. I beg of you to write and tell me. We,\r\n by God’s grace, are all quite well but in the water above our heads.\r\n We remain all day in the house, and nothing gladdens us so much as\r\n letters and news from you all. I commend myself to you.--Cafaggiuolo,\r\n December 16, 1478.[243]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _to_ Lucrezia de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifica Domina mea_,--The news we can send you from here are these.\r\n That the rain is so heavy and so continuous that we cannot leave the\r\n house and have exchanged hunting for playing at ball, so that the\r\n children should have exercise. Our stakes are generally the soup, the\r\n sweet, or the meat; and he who loses goes without; often when one of\r\n my scholars loses he pays tribute to Sir Humid.[244] I have no other\r\n news to give you. I remain in the house by the fireside in slippers\r\n and a greatcoat, were you to see me you would think I was melancholy\r\n personified. Perhaps I am but myself after all, for I neither do, nor\r\n see, nor hear anything that gives me pleasure so much have I taken\r\n our calamities to heart. Sleeping and waking they haunt me. Two days\r\n ago we began to spread our wings for we heard the plague had ceased;\r\n now we are again depressed on learning that it still lingers. When\r\n at Florence we have some sort of satisfaction, if nought else that\r\n of seeing Lorenzo come home in safety. Here we are in perpetual\r\n anxiety about everything. As for myself I declare to you that I am\r\n drowned in weary sloth, such is my solitude. I say solitude because\r\n Monsignore[245] shuts himself up in his room with only his thoughts\r\n for company, and I always find him so full of sorrow and apprehension\r\n that my melancholy is only increased in his company. Ser Alberto di\r\n Malerba mumbles prayers with these children all day long, so I remain\r\n alone, and when I am tired of study I ring the changes on plague and\r\n war, on grief for the past and fear for the future, and have no one\r\n with whom to air my phantasies. I do not find my Madonna Lucrezia in\r\n her room with whom I can unbosom myself and I am bored to death. Our\r\n sole relief is in letters from Florence, from Malerba, who has written\r\n these last few days, but I must tell you he generally sends good news\r\n which we believe for a little while, such is our desire that they may\r\n be true. But these plums usually turn into sloes. However I am trying\r\n to arm myself with hope and cling to everything in order not to sink\r\n to the bottom. I have nought else to say. I commend myself to Your\r\n Magnificence.--Cafaggiuolo, December 18, 1478. _Servitor_\r\n\r\n                                                           Angelus.[246]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to the_ King of Spain\r\n\r\n Most Serene and Excellent Lord my King: after humble recommendation,\r\n &c.,--I have been informed during the last few days that your Majesty\r\n wrote me a letter full Of affection and benevolence at that terrible\r\n time when my beloved brother Giuliano was so cruelly torn from me\r\n in the centre of the church, and when I was wounded. This letter, I\r\n know not why, never reached me; would to God it had, for the emotion\r\n evinced by so great a King would have been a great comfort to me when\r\n I was oppressed by such a terrible sorrow. Had I only known that the\r\n letter had been sent by your Majesty and delayed in the journey, it\r\n would have been no small comfort, and I should have at once thanked\r\n your Majesty for such a proof of kindly feeling towards me. Even\r\n now I send most heartfelt thanks and express my deep obligation. I\r\n desire nothing more than that an opportunity may arise for me to show\r\n my devotion to your Majesty. It is far beyond my power to repay not\r\n alone the letter, but even the slightest sign from so great a King,\r\n all I can do is to place myself entirely at your Majesty’s orders. I\r\n commend myself ever to your Majesty O my Lord and King, and beg to be\r\n taken under the shadow of your wings. Your Majesty is I know fully\r\n acquainted with our affairs. We are preparing for war and working hard\r\n to be able to resist the forces of the enemy. Resist we shall, as I\r\n hope, because we shall not fail to ourselves, and I trust God will aid\r\n the good cause. Again I commend myself to your Majesty, whom may God\r\n preserve in happiness.--Florence, April 3, 1479. Your Serene Majesty’s\r\n most devoted servant,\r\n\r\n                                                Lorenzo de’ Medici.[247]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano, _from Cafaggiuolo, to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici _at\r\nFlorence_\r\n\r\n Agnolo Poliziano to his patron Lorenzo de’ Medici greeting.\r\n\r\n Our little friend Piero writes you about what is happening here\r\n at Cafaggiuolo; it is my part to explain that his last letter was\r\n not, like the previous ones, submitted to me for suggestions while\r\n he composed it and then a fair copy made. It was completed in one\r\n sitting, as the saying is, and by himself alone. I only suggested in\r\n course of conversation what he should write about. The words and the\r\n composition are all his own.\r\n\r\n I am training him in such a way that I have no fear but that he will\r\n fulfil the expectations I have formed of him, although you fear his\r\n excessive impetuosity.\r\n\r\n As for Giovanni, you will have seen for yourself. His mother has taken\r\n it upon herself to change his course of reading to the Psalter, a\r\n thing I did not approve of. While she was absent he had made wonderful\r\n progress. He was already able to select, without any help from me, all\r\n the letters and syllables in his exercise in composition.\r\n\r\n My only petition to God is that I may be able to prove to you some day\r\n my loyalty, diligence, and patience. This I would willingly purchase\r\n even at the expense of death.\r\n\r\n I omit much lest I should weary your busy mind.\r\n\r\n Farewell and remember me with all the rest.--From Cafaggiuolo, April\r\n 6, 1479.[248]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici _to his father_ Lorenzo\r\n\r\n _Magnifice pater mi honorande_, &c.,--Till this day I have not written\r\n to you because nothing of importance has happened. A few days ago\r\n three well-armed boats arrived in the port of Cafaggiuolo from the\r\n village of Mozzete to offer us their services, and we made them\r\n welcome. We do not know what to do; I wish you would send us the best\r\n sporting dog that can be had. Nothing more. We all commend ourselves\r\n to you, I above all. I beg you will guard yourself from the plague and\r\n that you will remember us because we are little and have need of you.\r\n We are all well, thanks be to God, and so is Giuliano. I attend to my\r\n studies and the master commends himself to you.--Cafaggiuolo, April\r\n 16, 1479.[249]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice mi Domine_,--I am here at Careggi, having left Cafaggiuolo\r\n by command of Madonna Clarice. The cause and the manner of my\r\n departure I should wish, indeed I beg of you as a grace, to explain by\r\n word of mouth, it is too long to write. When you have heard me I think\r\n you will admit that all the fault is not mine. Out of respect, and not\r\n wishing to come to Florence _præter jussa tua_, I am here to await\r\n the commands of your Magnificence as to what I am to do, because I am\r\n yours even if the whole world was against me. If I have had but small\r\n success in serving you it was not that I did not serve with all my\r\n heart.

I, who have always written in Latin in order to give\r\n a more literary tone to my letters, have not yet had that pony you\r\n promised me; so that I am laughed at by all. See to it therefore, Your\r\n Magnificence, that she should not always be the winner. The war as\r\n far as I understand goes in our favour this year, but we do not quite\r\n understand how the sword that wounded us is to be broken if only the\r\n sheath is hit. For if the enemy makes war on us even outside his own\r\n country, on what does he rely for again attacking us another year when\r\n tired out. We only hope for peace through victory. Scipio is to be\r\n driven to Carthage in order to get Hannibal out of Italy. We beseech\r\n you, we your children, to have the more care for yourself the more you\r\n see that the enemy rather lays hidden snares than dares open warfare.\r\n\r\n I commend Martino to you, who aids me not to forget my Greek and\r\n to improve my Latin.[251] He would have been named chaplain of S.\r\n Lorenzo by his patrons, Antonio and Lorenzo Tornabuoni, had not Your\r\n Magnificence recommended another. It is but just that they should\r\n bestow their patronage on their own people, and not be prevented in\r\n so doing by you, who in general give to others what is yours. I hope\r\n therefore to have letters recommending my Martino to those to whom he\r\n has already recommended himself. God save you.--26th May 1479.\r\n\r\n                                                    Your son Piero.[252]\r\n\r\n\r\nClarice de’ Medici _to her husband_ Lorenzo\r\n\r\n _Magnifice Conjux_, &c.,--I hear the plague is committing more ravages\r\n in Florence than usual. Your wife and children pray with all their\r\n might that you will take care of yourself, and if you can, with due\r\n precaution, come here and see the festival we should be greatly\r\n consoled. I should be glad not to be turned into ridicule by Franco,\r\n as was Luigi Pulci, and also that Messer Agnolo [Poliziano] should not\r\n be able to say that he will live in your house whether I like it or\r\n no, and that you have put him into your own room at Fiesole. You know\r\n I told you that if you wished him to remain I was perfectly content,\r\n and although I have endured a thousand insults if it has been by your\r\n permission I will be patient, but this I can hardly believe. I quite\r\n understand that Ser Niccolò has entreated me to make peace with him.\r\n The children are all well and long to see you, I long even more, for I\r\n have no other torment than that you should be at Florence during such\r\n times. I commend myself always to you.--Cafaggiuolo, May 28, 1479.[253]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to his mother_ Lucrezia _in Florence_\r\n\r\n Most beloved Mother,--You will have heard from Ser Niccolò that there\r\n has been a case of plague at Cafaggiuolo, I have nothing more to add.\r\n For precaution sake we left there at once and came to Trebbio. I\r\n enclose a list of things Messer Stefano has prescribed in order to be\r\n prepared should anything happen. Please God it may all end in nothing.\r\n Do not be at all anxious. No more.--Trebbio, May 31, 1479.\r\n\r\n                                                           Your Lorenzo.\r\n\r\n Send the things here quickly.[254]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici _at Cafaggiuolo to his father_ Lorenzo\r\n\r\n Magnificent Father mine,--That pony does not come, and I am afraid\r\n that it will remain so long with you that Andrea will cause it to\r\n change from a beast to a man, instead of curing its hoof.\r\n\r\n We are all well and studying. Giovanni is beginning to spell. By this\r\n letter you can judge where I am in writing; as for Greek I keep myself\r\n rather in exercise by the help of Martino than make any progress.\r\n Giuliano laughs and thinks of nothing else; Lucrezia sews, sings, and\r\n reads; Maddalena knocks her head against the wall, but without doing\r\n herself any harm; Luisa begins to say a few little words; Contessina\r\n fills the house with her noise. All the others attend to their duties,\r\n and nothing is wanting to us save your presence. We hear that things\r\n are better than last year, and hope that you being well there will be\r\n nought but victory in the future. Strong and brave men are not good at\r\n subterfuges but shine in open warfare. Thus we confide in you, as we\r\n well know that besides your goodness and valour you bear in mind the\r\n heritage left to us by our ancestors, and the injury and outrages we\r\n have endured. God save you--1479.\r\n\r\n                                                    Your son Piero.[255]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici _at Cafaggiuolo to his father_ Lorenzo\r\n\r\n Magnificent Father mine,--I fear that some misfortune has happened to\r\n that pony, for had it been well I know you would have sent it to me\r\n as you promised. I beg of you therefore as a grace that you will take\r\n this fear from me; for I think of it night and day, and until the pony\r\n comes I shall have no peace. In case that one cannot come be pleased\r\n to send me another. For, as I have already written to you, I am here\r\n on foot, and sometimes it is necessary for me to go in the company of\r\n my friends. See to this therefore, Your Magnificence.\r\n\r\n I am studying hard, and all here attend to their duties. It only needs\r\n that you should diligently guard yourself from the plague and from\r\n every other danger of death, and that you should come here sometimes\r\n to see us. God save you.--1479.\r\n\r\n                                                    Your son Piero.[256]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero de’ Medici _at Gagliano to his father_ Lorenzo\r\n\r\n _Magnifico Patri meo_,--I cannot tell you, Magnificent Father, how\r\n glad I am to have the pony, and how his arrival incites me to work.\r\n If I desire to praise him, _Ante diem clause componet vesper Olympo_.\r\n He is so handsome and so perfect that the trumpet of Maronius would\r\n hardly suffice to sing his praises. You may think how I love him;\r\n particularly when his joyous neighs resound and rejoice all the\r\n neighbourhood. I owe you and I send you many thanks for such a fine\r\n gift, and I shall try and repay you by becoming what you wish. Of this\r\n be sure. I promise you that I shall try with all my heart. We are all\r\n well, and we all long for your arrival. God save you.--1479.[257]\r\n\r\n                                        Your son Piero at Gagliano.[258]\r\n\r\n\r\nAntonio Pucci _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici _at Cafaggiuolo_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice Frater honorande_,--That priest from Imola has been\r\n interrogated. He says Count Girolamo [Riario] sent him here to offer,\r\n on the pretext that he had been badly treated, to poison the Count;\r\n thinking that we, desiring the Count’s death, would entrust him with\r\n poison. We were then to be accused to the Pope, and in the Consistory,\r\n and the Count was to show the poison, saying, “See, Lorenzo de’\r\n Medici has attempted to poison me.” He also offered to consign into\r\n our hands one of the gates of Imola in order to accuse us before the\r\n Pope and the Cardinals so that they might imagine that we were going\r\n to make war on the Pope. He has been tortured and shall be put to\r\n the question again in order to get everything out of him. God guard\r\n thee.--Florence, June 18, 1479.\r\n\r\n Till to-day there have been eighteen deaths and fourteen new cases [of\r\n plague]. Benedetto Nori is one.[259]\r\n\r\n\r\nLucrezia de’ Medici (_daughter of Lorenzo_) _to her grandmother_\r\nLucrezia\r\n\r\n Magnificent and loved as a Mother,--I send you news that we are all\r\n well; and I hope you are so too, may God keep us so. I long to see\r\n you and pray you to come, for it seems to me a thousand years since I\r\n last saw you. Mona Lucrezia mine, I wish you would send me a sash of\r\n the _palio_ of Sancto Giovanni, or better still that one from Volterra\r\n which was given to you when you stood godmother to me. Piero and\r\n Maddalena commend themselves to you and Giovanni begs you to send him\r\n some sugar-plums, he says that last time you sent very few. I pray you\r\n to answer, for reading your letters is a great comfort to me. No more.\r\n Christ guard you from all ill.--Written on July 7, 1479.\r\n\r\n                                      Your Lucrezia in Cafaggiuolo.[260]\r\n\r\n\r\nNannina Rucellai _to her mother_ Lucrezia de’ Medici\r\n\r\n To the honoured hands of the Magnificent Lady Lucrezia de’ Medicis at\r\n Careggi.\r\n\r\n Dearest Mother,--I must tell you that Bernardo has dismissed the tutor\r\n to my great sorrow, as I do not know where to send him. At Figline,\r\n from whence he comes, the plague is very bad; in his house two of his\r\n brothers are dead and his father is ill. Vincenzo has not a farthing,\r\n if he had anything he spent it here in clothes, and now we repay him\r\n with “Go in peace.” Nothing could be more displeasing to me. Whoso\r\n wants to do as they wish should not be born a woman. I should be so\r\n glad if you will ask Lorenzo, if not inconvenient, to give him shelter\r\n where he would not be in the way for two or three months until the\r\n plague has ceased. I do not think he is capable of teaching any save\r\n the little ones, whom he might look after and teach. You could not do\r\n me a greater pleasure, as it will show that I have some one who is\r\n willing to oblige me; there are others who do the reverse. If during\r\n this time he should be in need of a little money for his clothes\r\n I will provide it from my own pocket, for he seems to me in a bad\r\n plight. Here I could give him nothing as I had no money. I should be\r\n glad if any small sum comes into your hands or any small living you\r\n would help him, for I do not like to repay him with ingratitude. We\r\n are all well. I commend myself to you, commend me to Lorenzo and kiss\r\n Giulio for me. Christ guard you and see that you guard yourself.--In\r\n Casentino, July 12, 1479.\r\n\r\n                                                      Your Nannina.[261]\r\n\r\n\r\nBianca de’ Pazzi _to her mother_ Lucrezia de’ Medici _at Careggi_\r\n\r\n Dearest and most honoured Mother,--I have had a letter from you\r\n which has greatly consoled me as I see you are all in good health,\r\n particularly you and Lorenzo, I pray God to keep you so for many\r\n years. I have not written before as I feared to importune you and also\r\n because I have sent often to your house to Marco for malvasy and for\r\n the book of St. Margaret, all of which I have received; and from him I\r\n heard news of you. I should have sent to you [at Careggi] but thought\r\n that on account of the plague you would keep close guard. We have had\r\n it near here, but by the grace of God it is now finished. So I did\r\n not send as I ought to have done. As I told you in Florence I mean\r\n to lie in here for I know you have enough on your hands, and I want\r\n for nothing. If I am worse than usual which I do not expect as by the\r\n grace of God I am very well, I am in the ninth month now and as I said\r\n well, should anything unforeseen happen there is Maestro Giorgio close\r\n by who fled here from the plague. So be in no anxiety about me for I\r\n feel sure God will assist me as ever, if it so pleases Him. Of the\r\n family in the Mugello I hear good news, which rejoices me, and also\r\n of Nannina,[262] who they tell me passed along the road going to the\r\n Casentino. I am so glad you are all of you well, which is not little\r\n to say in such times as these, for I was and I am anxious about you as\r\n you said you had to see so many people. I wonder you were not somewhat\r\n afraid, but our Lord God will not abandon us entirely. Do persuade\r\n Lorenzo to take more care, for I hear he has no fear at all[263] ...\r\n on all sides, and also to beware of his enemies. Until this sickness\r\n is past he ought to put his pleasures on one side; if he lives he will\r\n have more than now, for I trust God will recompense him for the ill\r\n he has received. I commend myself to him, as do these children, and\r\n Guglielmo commends himself to you and to Lorenzo. By the grace of God\r\n we are all well.--Alla Torre, July 15, 1479.\r\n\r\n                                                       Your Bianca.[264]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _to_ Lucrezia de’ Medici _at Careggi_\r\n\r\n Magnificent Madonna mine,--By Tommaso I send back your lauds,\r\n sonnets, and poems in terza rima, which you lent me when I was with\r\n you the other day. All these women were delighted with them and\r\n Madonna Lucrezia, or rather Lucrezia, has learnt all the lauds and\r\n many sonnets of _the_ Lucrezia by heart.[265] There is also a little\r\n white book in manuscript which I beg you to give to your and my good\r\n Giovanni Tornabuoni, it contains certain rules his children asked me\r\n to give them. I am also writing to Giovanni, to the children, and to\r\n their master. I pray you to give him the letters and to commend me to\r\n him, for I set great store and count much on the affection he shows\r\n me. I have been to see Lorenzo several times and cannot describe how\r\n well he received me. Do try and discover what are his intentions with\r\n regard to me; it would surprise me if Piero were allowed to lose time,\r\n it would be a great pity. I hear that Messer Bernardo, brother of Ser\r\n Niccolò, is with him, but I do not know how his teaching will combine\r\n with mine.[266] If he is to remain permanently, then of a truth I\r\n can assume that the bubble has burst. But I cannot believe it, and\r\n therefore beg you to find out what are Lorenzo’s intentions, then I\r\n shall know whether I am to arm for a joust only or for war. It will\r\n be easy for you and I shall always be at the beck and call of Lorenzo\r\n as I am sure he knows better than I, and that he will put me in an\r\n honourable position as he always has done and as my fidelity and good\r\n services merit. I am working hard. Till now I have not been able to\r\n send you the promised book as one copy is at Florence and the other\r\n at the binder’s who has kept it a long time. As soon as I have it I\r\n will send it. I commend myself to you and I pray you to commend me to\r\n Lorenzo.--Fiesole, July 18, 1479. Your Magnificence’s servant,\r\n\r\n                                                Angelus Polizianus.[267]\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from Vespucci’s letters to the “Ten” allude\r\nto the one victory gained by the Florentine troops over the Prefect\r\nof Rome, nephew of Pope Sixtus IV., near Lake Trasimene during the\r\nwar between Florence and the Pope with his ally the King of Naples,\r\nin 1479. But the fortune of war soon changed. The Florentines were\r\nbeaten at Poggibonsi, within sixteen miles of Florence, by the Duke of\r\nCalabria. Fortunately for her, Duke Alfonso stopped to lay siege to the\r\nsmall walled town of Colle which held out for two months and inflicted\r\nconsiderable loss on his army. Meanwhile the summer, generally\r\nconsidered in the fifteenth century to be the only proper time for\r\nfighting, was over; the Duke offered a three months’ truce, withdrew\r\nhis troops to winter quarters, and Florence was saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidantonio Vespucci, _Legatus in Epistolis at Paris, to the_ Ten of\r\nthe Balìa _in Florence_\r\n\r\n When the King of France heard the news he gave signs of great joy,\r\n kneeling as is his wont three times and kissing the ground, thanking\r\n God. All that day he talked of nought else with his people, saying:\r\n “My friends the Florentines and my cousin Lorenzo de’ Medici will\r\n have their revenge this year....” You heard how the King’s Majesty\r\n had received news of the glorious victory of our troops near Perugia\r\n and how delighted he was, so that according to what I hear from court\r\n he showed extreme pleasure both by actions and in words, to the great\r\n content of the Magnificent Monsignor of Argenton[268] who, as though\r\n he had been a born Florentine, continually _tamquam tuba exprobando_\r\n the acts of the Pontiff and of King Ferrante, goes about Paris\r\n proclaiming our victory; particularly to those ecclesiastics whom I\r\n have met sometimes at supper with his Lordship.\r\n\r\nVespucci adds that Louis XI. refused to receive a certain Raffaello\r\nBallerini sent by the Pope to explain his actions, and that when\r\nKing Ferrante asked that his galleys might use the ports of Nice and\r\nProvence for the purpose of attacking the Florentines, the Duke of\r\nSavoy by command of the King of France refused his consent.--1479.[269]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Girolamo Morelli, _Florentine Ambassador at\r\nMilan_\r\n\r\n Yours of the 8th and 9th tell me that everything goes well there.\r\n It is useless for me to say much as we must wait to see how affairs\r\n shape themselves and try to turn them in our favour. I cannot believe\r\n that the Lord Lodovico being all-powerful and an absolute ruler will\r\n consent to our undoing, because it would be against his interest. He\r\n is by nature kindly and has never received any injury from us either\r\n public or private. It is true that he obtained power by the King’s\r\n favour, but I think he is even more beholden to the help given him\r\n by others and to his own qualities. From the little I know of His\r\n Lordship he seems to me capable of understanding what is right and\r\n willing to execute what he understands. Therefore as soon as you can\r\n it would be well to see His Lordship and demonstrate to him that on\r\n account of ancient friendship we expect nothing but good from him,\r\n there being no reason for antagonism, and according to my view it\r\n will be his interest. Impress upon him that this city desires to go\r\n hand in hand with the State of Milan, that is with His Lordship, and\r\n for this reason beg and encourage him to inform you in some measure\r\n of his intentions so that we may act in conformity with his wishes.\r\n Explain our difficulties to him, and how they react upon that State,\r\n and the remedy which is in his own hands. This is what I have to say\r\n at present. As soon as I received your first intimation I despatched\r\n Niccolò d’Antonio Martelli, who is very intimate with His Lordship,\r\n it was through him that formerly I transacted all important affairs\r\n with His Lordship. I send him to you to whom he will show all his\r\n despatches. He will soon be with you, as to-day he must be at Bologna.\r\n It appears to me that we must now throw ourselves entirely into the\r\n arms of His Lordship and discover as soon as possible what are his\r\n ideas and his intentions towards us, and this quickly, for I have\r\n had no letter from him. I have thought it better to write to him and\r\n enclose the letter, but I rely more on your interview with him, when\r\n you can tell him as much as you think fit of what I have written. I\r\n commend myself to you.--Florence, September 11, 1479.\r\n\r\n I must remind you of what I wrote yesterday about the Marquis of\r\n Mantua. If he is deposed that country will immediately be included\r\n among our enemies, it would be our ruin.\r\n\r\n                                             Laurentius de Medicis.[270]\r\n\r\nIn November Niccolò Martelli, the trusted friend of Lorenzo, was\r\nstill in Milan, and on the 12th Lodovico Sforza (il Moro) told him to\r\ninform Lorenzo that the King of Naples would be willing to listen to\r\novertures of peace, and that he strongly advised him to strike while\r\nthe iron was hot. Ten days later he told the same thing to Pier Filippo\r\nPandolfini, the Florentine ambassador, adding that Lorenzo ought not\r\nto trust Venice who thought only of her own interests, and would leave\r\nFlorence in the lurch. He could himself promise little or nothing as\r\nMilan was sore pressed, and he wished Lorenzo to know this, in order\r\nto avoid future recrimination. He advised immediate action, and was\r\nready to undertake negotiations with Naples. It is clear that Lodovico\r\nhad been charged by King Ferrante to sound Lorenzo. On November 24th\r\nFilippo Strozzi, who had lived long in Naples and knew the King well,\r\nleft Florence on a secret mission. “I was to tell the King,” he writes\r\nin his journal, “that Lorenzo placed himself in the King’s hands,\r\nand would willingly do all the King desired if he only gave peace to\r\nFlorence, and restored to her the towns she had lost. I found H.M. at\r\nArnone [at the mouth of the Volturno] hunting, and when I delivered my\r\nmessage he answered that he had later news; that Lorenzo was coming\r\nin person, and so we would wait and see what his visit would bring\r\nforth.”[271]\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Lorenzo to the Signoria was written after\r\nhe had started for Naples. Many in Florence feared that he might meet\r\nthe same fate as Piccinino, who had been invited to Naples and foully\r\nmurdered by the King’s orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the_ Signoria _of Florence, from_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Most Illustrious my Lords,--It is not from presumption that I did not\r\n notify the reason of my departure to Your Illustrious Excellencies,\r\n but because it seemed to me that the agitated and disturbed condition\r\n of our city demands acts and not words. I conceive that she desires,\r\n and indeed has extreme need of peace. Seeing that all other endeavours\r\n have been fruitless, I have determined to run some peril in my own\r\n person rather than expose the city to disaster. Therefore, with the\r\n permission of Your Excellencies of the Signoria, I have decided to\r\n go openly to Naples. Being the one most hated and persecuted by\r\n our enemies I may by placing myself in their hands be the means of\r\n restoring peace to our city. One of two things is certain, either\r\n His Majesty the King loves our city as he has asserted and some have\r\n believed, and is attempting to gain our friendship by affronting us\r\n rather than by despoiling us of liberty; or His Majesty really desires\r\n the ruin of this Republic. If his intentions are good there is no\r\n better way of testing them than by placing myself voluntarily in his\r\n power, and I make bold to say that this is the only way to make peace\r\n and to render the condition of our city stable. If His Majesty the\r\n King intends to attack our liberty it seems to me well to know the\r\n worst quickly, and that one should be injured rather than the many. I\r\n am most glad to be that one, for two reasons: first, because being\r\n the principal object of our enemies’ hatred I can more easily and\r\n better explain all to the King, as it may be that our enemies only\r\n seek to injure me. The other reason is that having a greater position\r\n and larger stake in our city, not only than I deserve but probably\r\n than any citizen in our days, I am more bound than any other man\r\n to give up all to my country, even my life. These are the feelings\r\n with which I go, for perchance our Lord God desires that this war,\r\n which began with the blood of my brother and my own, should be put an\r\n end to by me. My ardent wish is that either my life or my death, my\r\n misfortunes or my well-being, should contribute to the good of our\r\n city. I shall therefore carry out my idea. If it succeeds according\r\n to my wishes and hopes I shall be most glad to benefit my country\r\n at the risk of my life and at the same time to save myself. Should\r\n evil befall me I shall not complain if it benefits our city, as it\r\n certainly must; for if our adversaries only aim at me, they will have\r\n me in their hands: if they want aught else it will be patent to all.\r\n I am certain that our citizens will unite to protect their liberty,\r\n so that by the grace of God it will be defended as was always done\r\n by our fathers. I go full of hope, and with no other object than the\r\n good of the city, and I pray God to give me grace to perform what is\r\n the duty of every man towards his country. I commend myself humbly to\r\n Your Excellencies of the Signoria.--From San Miniato on the 7th day of\r\n December 1479. Your Excellencies’ Servant,\r\n\r\n                                             Laurentius de Medicis.[272]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Antonio Montecatino, _Ambassador to Florence of\r\nthe Duke of Ferrara_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice tanquam Pater_,--From S. Miniato I wrote to tell you the\r\n reason of my departure, but as a note from you does not mention my\r\n letter, perhaps you will have had it later.\r\n\r\n Anyhow I reply briefly to assure you that your affairs and those\r\n of your and my Illustrious Lord are most dear to me, and that at\r\n present and in the future they are and ever will be more so. I know\r\n my obligations towards His Excellency, and know what is my duty,\r\n which I shall perform. Wherever Lorenzo de’ Medici intervenes Your\r\n Lordship may be sure that there is one of your most faithful servants.\r\n His Excellency will know this from the effects if I succeed in doing\r\n what I wish. Meanwhile this is to inform Your Magnificence that I\r\n hope to leave here to-night and to join the galleys, which arrived\r\n this evening, at dawn. On board is Ser Giantommaso Caraffa, son of\r\n the Count di Matalone, and Prinzivalle di Gennaro, whose position at\r\n the court of the Duke of Calabria I think you are aware of. They have\r\n come to bear me company, though a far greater man than I am would be\r\n much honoured by their companionship. I pray God may lead me there and\r\n bring me back in safety, having accomplished something. I beg you to\r\n let Your Illustrious Lords and Madonna know what I have written, and I\r\n commend myself to their Excellencies and to you.--Pisa, the 10th day\r\n of December 1479.\r\n\r\n                                      Filius Laurentius de Medicis.[273]\r\n\r\n\r\nBartolommeo Scala, _Secretary of the Florentine Republic, to_ Lorenzo\r\nde’ Medici _at Naples_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice Pater mi_,--I send herewith a duplicate of the mandate in\r\n case the first has not reached you, your primary instructions and the\r\n letter of credit. I think however that you will have received them as\r\n Poccia had a safe-conduct from the Duke.\r\n\r\n As you are to use them I hope they are according to your wishes. If\r\n anything is wanting I beg you to send me the formula you desire and it\r\n shall be sent.\r\n\r\n I also send you a cipher if you want to write anything secret.\r\n\r\n How things go at Sarzana owing to the return of Ser Alessandro you\r\n will see by the letter of the 10th. The Duke of Calabria continues\r\n the same line of conduct with letters and mandates drawn up like an\r\n agreement for peace. It does not seem to me to promise well. Deal\r\n with it as you think best. We have more adversaries in this matter\r\n than is pleasant, and maybe he who ought to favour us does not do so,\r\n but craftily acts against us in the interests of others. I cannot now\r\n write more openly, another time I will explain at greater length in\r\n cipher.\r\n\r\n Your letter of the 18th rejoiced us all, and peace seemed imminent.\r\n That of the 22nd altered the outlook and gave rise to grave thought\r\n in those who heard it. The reply was debated on for several days. You\r\n will see what was decided. Only to you would such large powers be\r\n given in so important a matter. It is the first time a white sheet\r\n [unlimited authority] has been given, for it amounts to that. But as\r\n it is to you that such a commission is sent no one doubts that good\r\n will come of it. I, as your devoted friend, point out that whatever\r\n was not carried through here at once has been completed by the\r\n authority given to you in the last paragraph of your letter. Peace\r\n would be most welcome here, but if the conditions are not honourable\r\n you know our nature; we praise or we blame according to which way\r\n the wind blows or our feelings move us. We do not trouble to reason.\r\n The Milanese appear favourable but there [at Naples] you will know\r\n better about this. Venice will I think not be satisfied with anything\r\n which would be displeasing to us. But you understand all this better\r\n than I can explain it so I will not enter into more particulars, as\r\n I know you are kept minutely informed by others. I commend myself to\r\n you.--Florence, January 1, 1479 (1480).[274]\r\n\r\n\r\nBartolommeo Scala, _Secretary to the Florentine Republic, to_ Lorenzo\r\nde’ Medici _at Naples_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice Benefactor mi_,--I take the keenest delight for many\r\n reasons in your letters, both in those you write to me and in those\r\n written to the Ten. _In primis_ for the hope you give both in public\r\n and in private of good results. God will not frustrate your work _et\r\n ricordabitut servi sui_. You are satisfied with the mandate so I am\r\n content. In former times things pertaining to knighthood were much\r\n prized there [at Naples]. This is why I acted as I did. I am not at\r\n all vexed, how could I be with anything you do with regard to public\r\n things or with regard to myself, who owe everything to you and to whom\r\n I would give my life?\r\n\r\n The affairs of Milan have put new life into some people here, they\r\n are well known and much discussed. You will see by the copies the\r\n Office sends what has arrived here. But there are those who do not put\r\n much faith in words when gainsaid by deeds. Nevertheless the general\r\n opinion is that they desire to keep that duck and make it grow,\r\n because reason and duty must at last prevail. I tell you this in order\r\n that you should insist as much as you can on honourable conditions\r\n of peace, so that no one here will be able to say that your going to\r\n Naples has made things worse, as a few have already tried to induce\r\n others to believe and say: You know how many we are, but boys, &c.\r\n\r\n Enclosed is a mandate from the Lord of Faenza. He has talked to me and\r\n displays great faith in you, nevertheless I see he is much alarmed,\r\n and suspicious of that prince [Duke of Milan?]. A Venetian ambassador\r\n is at Faenza with 200 soldiers as a guard. I had the same suspicion,\r\n and suspected others as well, as I have told you before, and now it is\r\n increased by what has happened at Rimini. Although Pesaro has always\r\n followed our lead, yet suspicions and State jealousies have great\r\n influence on men’s minds. We must carefully consider what security\r\n can be given to pacify them, particularly as lies are told about\r\n everything as one knows is always the case in such important affairs.\r\n\r\n Your dealings with H.M. the King about the restitution of Sarzana is\r\n much commended. If it can be obtained before peace is concluded, for\r\n every one here had lost all hope and even doubted that peace would be\r\n made, you would gain much honour and all would be attributed to you.\r\n\r\n Here everything goes on as when you left, there is still some\r\n ill-humour, but it is I think a good sign that it is less apparent\r\n than when you were here. Your reputation seems to have increased and\r\n if all ends as we desire and you give us hopes--_nihil supra_. I\r\n commend myself to you.--From the Palace [Florence], January 12, 1479\r\n (1480).\r\n\r\n News has reached here written from there [Naples] to private\r\n individuals in Rome, by, I have been told, persons in your suite,\r\n _sunt pleni rimarum_ written by them in Naples. If you think this\r\n matters admonish them, but without mentioning me, for as you know we\r\n live in glass houses.[275]\r\n\r\n\r\nBartolommeo Scala, _Secretary of the Florentine Republic, to_ Lorenzo\r\nde’ Medici _at Naples_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice Pater benefactor mi_,--We are all hoping against hope for\r\n the conclusion of this affair which has delayed so long, as you will\r\n see by the letter of the Ten. Letters from Rome come often to our\r\n merchants which addle our brains, not only do they vary every time,\r\n but are contradictory. The Pope will never consent. The Count agrees\r\n to everything. The Pope agrees, the Count will not hear of it, &c.\r\n The news is crumbled into a thousand bits. Messer Lorenzo da Castello\r\n has gone to lay the land waste, also he has gone to set things right,\r\n also to clear up matters, in short infinite are the opinions and the\r\n whims. For the love of God get us out of this by the good offices of\r\n him [King of Naples] on whom we are to depend in future; for his power\r\n and authority are such that finally every one will have to do as he\r\n pleases. The Ten desire your return either with peace or without,\r\n but more with peace. This long delay is grievous to them and to all,\r\n especially to your friends. Yet, notwithstanding, hope and faith in\r\n H.M. the King grows day by day and affection towards you. And as it\r\n appears _agat partes nostras_ in this treaty of peace against our\r\n other adversaries, I encourage this opinion as much as I can, because\r\n it seems to me beneficial to our public and private needs. Everything\r\n here is quiet and in the same condition as when you left, as I told\r\n you before. If there is peace you will see how the city will flourish.\r\n I commend myself to you.--Florence, January 15, 1479 (1480), _quam\r\n raptim_.[276]\r\n\r\n\r\nDoctor Oliverio, _from Bagno a Morba, to_ Lucrezia de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Magnificent and honoured _Domina, humili commendatione premissa,\r\n salutem_,--In my last I informed Your Magnificence that the spring\r\n called _Cacio cotto_[277] gave about six barrels[278] a day and\r\n that we are now searching for an increased supply. Being anxious to\r\n meet your wishes and to prevent the said water from escaping from\r\n whence it rises as I found had been the case, whereby much of its\r\n virtue is lost, I caused the building made for Giovanni di Pace to\r\n be demolished, and at the bottom, nearly in the centre of the Bath,\r\n I found another spring and several smaller ones which will give much\r\n water, and are exactly the same as that of _Caccio cotto_, which[279]\r\n ... give twenty barrels, or more.[280] The ingredients contained in\r\n the said water are sulphur and some alum. It is excellent for scabies\r\n and for asthma, it is a dissolvent, heals all ills in the body and\r\n pains in the joints and the nerves. Many other virtues are contained\r\n in it as I will demonstrate to Your Magnificence. Also of the other\r\n springs, particularly that of the principal bath, you shall have exact\r\n descriptions, for I am analysing the said waters with all diligence,\r\n and in three days I hope to finish this work entrusted to me. I\r\n commend myself to Your Magnificence.--The 28th April 1480.\r\n\r\n                                                 Oliverius Medicus.[281]\r\n\r\n\r\nIppolita Maria d’Aragona, _Duchess of Calabria, to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice Domine amice specialissime_,--If Giovacchino had arrived\r\n at Florence without any letter from me Your Magnificence would have\r\n had every right to complain. To avoid this therefore I write; and\r\n also to satisfy H.M. the King, who often asks how I stand with my\r\n confederate, that is with you. This letter however is not that of a\r\n confederate, nor is it political, but only to tell Your Magnificence\r\n how continually we think of you. But we are not at all sure that you\r\n often think of our walk, which is in great beauty with all the flowers\r\n out, in truth it does not wish to be visited by a crowd in order to\r\n put forth tender shoots. Anyhow the walk and ourselves both bear Your\r\n Magnificence in our memories. Giovacchino, the bearer of this, is our\r\n very good friend, and we recommend him to Your Magnificence, not only\r\n in a general way but _etiam_ in things which touch his honour and\r\n reputation, praying that you will grant him, for love of us, every aid\r\n and thus give us much pleasure.--Naples, July 3, 1480.\r\n\r\n                                                  Castello Capuano.[282]\r\n\r\n\r\nPapinio di Artimino _to_ Lucrezia de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifica Domina post humilissima comendamenta vestra_,--For some\r\n time I have not written to Your Magnificence, now I write to tell you:\r\n that this evening news has come from H.M. the King [of Naples] that\r\n the Turkish army has arrived in Apulia and has already seized more\r\n than twenty towns and castles, and taken prisoners more than fifteen\r\n thousand inhabitants, whom they have butchered in most cruel fashion.\r\n They are said now to be encamped before a port called Oitontoto\r\n [Otranto], where they have disembarked ten thousand men and more than\r\n four thousand horses, and have planted many mortars with which they\r\n are bombarding the walls. The opinion of those who have been there is\r\n that by now the town is lost. This news has made a great sensation\r\n here and is held to be very serious. God help us in our need: for I\r\n see it will cause the affairs of Italy to be forgotten.[283]\r\n\r\n Then there is also a report that H.M. the King has spontaneously ceded\r\n all our castles and has ordered M. Giovan Battista Bentivoglio to\r\n consign them to the Florentines; this is good news.\r\n\r\n I shall have your yarn on the 10th of this month, it has been spun at\r\n Naples and Benedetto Salutati writes that you have been well served,\r\n so, if you wish, as soon as I get it I can send it on to you. I\r\n delayed, if you remember, until my return. Tell me what to do and your\r\n commands shall be obeyed. I think we shall be here all September. I\r\n have no more to say save that I commend myself to Your Magnificence,\r\n and if any friend of yours is at present Vicar of San Giovanni, I beg\r\n you to keep me in mind, for I should do you honour. Valete.--In Rome,\r\n August 4, 1480. Your servant,\r\n\r\n                               Papinio di Artimino, _Cancellarius_.[284]\r\n\r\n\r\nPapinio di Artimino, _from Rome, to_ Lucrezia de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifica atque honestissima Domina, post recomandationem_ &c.,--In\r\n my last of the 2nd instant I replied to a letter of Your Magnificence\r\n of the 26th of last month, and informed you of what had happened until\r\n now.\r\n\r\n Now I must tell Your Magnificence that this morning while visiting\r\n the ambassador of H.M. the King to hear whether there was any fresh\r\n news, he told me that he had heard from the Venetian ambassador that\r\n the Turkish camp which was at Rhodes had been broken up, and the army\r\n had returned to Constantinople, the Venetian ambassador said he had\r\n letters to this effect. If true, this seems to me good news.\r\n\r\n On Monday morning a school-building here fell and it was feared that\r\n more than twenty boys had been killed. But only the master perished,\r\n which is looked upon as a great miracle. The loud screams of the\r\n fathers and the mothers cannot be described. God, at that moment,\r\n shielded innocence. He continues to work great wonders. Let us pray\r\n that He will not look at our great sins.\r\n\r\n Messer Antonio Ridolfi, the ambassador of our Republic, bears himself\r\n in such guise that all the citizens are much indebted to him, he never\r\n ceases day or night to solicit and press forward their affairs. I have\r\n hopes in Almighty God and His glorious Mother the Virgin Mary that he\r\n may return with great honour and an end be put to so much tribulation.\r\n May God be pleased to do this.\r\n\r\n By my letter of the 23rd of last month I suggested, in case you and\r\n the Magnificent Lorenzo approved, that His Magnificence should\r\n write a letter to the Cardinal of Milan and one to the Cardinal of\r\n Portugal advising and begging them to accelerate this holy enterprise;\r\n for although they are well disposed yet I know it would help\r\n matters much. I see their Seigneuries often and they are favourably\r\n inclined. _Valete._--_Ex Roma, die 8 Octobris 1480.

This is the case now that Your\r\n Serenity informs me that the Magnificent Messer Andrea Cappello and\r\n his brothers are satisfied. I do not feel that I need trouble Your\r\n Serenity with any explanations about this business as I have written\r\n to Giovanni Frescobaldi [Florentine ambassador at Venice] to explain\r\n some points by which Your Serenity will see that I have fulfilled\r\n _ad unquem_ the obligations imposed on me by those known to Your\r\n Excellency. I beg humbly that you will deign to listen favourably to\r\n the reasons Giovanni will state in my defence and to rest assured that\r\n as I have never yet broken faith with any man I shall not be found\r\n wanting in far more important affairs than those now under discussion\r\n by those Magnificent Citizens. I trust that the friendship that has\r\n always existed between us will be preserved by the intervention of\r\n those who have concluded this business between us and will enable me\r\n to continue to act according to my precepts. I confide in the great\r\n goodness and clemency of Your Serenity when you hear my justification,\r\n and I desire and hope to retain the good opinion and the friendship\r\n of Your Excellency, which has been gained by the long service\r\n of my ancestors and myself to that Illustrious State and to Your\r\n Serenity.--1480. To whom, &c.[286]\r\n\r\n\r\n_To_ Albino, _dear to me as a brother, Secretary of the Illustrious_\r\nDuke of Calabria, _from_ Lorenzo de’ Medici[287]\r\n\r\n Albino my dear and good Brother,--I cannot decide whether your letters\r\n of 2nd and 8th May give me more pleasure than pain. With the strongest\r\n desire for the fame of our Lord Duke, which has begun so well by the\r\n good beating of those Turkish dogs on the 18th, comes a fear that His\r\n Lordship may not come to some harm by his courage. Those skirmishes\r\n which you describe, at which His Lordship often assists, made me turn\r\n pale more than once, for I have read and re-read your letter. If\r\n possible, my Albino, send us news often, and implore His Lordship to\r\n be cautious. I will say no more because I feel nervous as I write. Bid\r\n him to take care of his person for the sake of God and himself, and\r\n for us his servants, and do what is needful at the peril of others and\r\n not of his own. You, who are by his side, must see to this even at\r\n the price of your own life, and if you do not on your own account do\r\n it for mine, if you love me. Commend me to His Lordship. I anxiously\r\n await your reply to hear whether this my friendly recommendation has\r\n any effect without hindering what I look upon as certain, and that\r\n is that His Lordship will return from the expedition wreathed with\r\n laurels. So I expect from day to day to have your news.--Florence, May\r\n 18, 1481.\r\n\r\n                                              Laurentius de Medici.[288]\r\n\r\nThese and other extracts from despatches of the various Ferrarese\r\nambassadors are inserted as they give such vivid pictures of Lorenzo\r\nand of the condition of Florence. Day by day rumours, gossip, and their\r\nown conversations with Lorenzo were noted down for the information of\r\ntheir master Ercole d’Este, Duke of Ferrara and Modena.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From_ Bartolommeo Sgnippi, _Clerk of the Embassy, to_ Antonio\r\nMontecatino, _Ambassador of the Duke of Ferrara (who had gone to\r\nFerrara for a few days) to the Florentine Republic_\r\n\r\n Magnificent Ambassador,--I make known unto you that the day before\r\n yesterday in the evening a certain Moroto Baldovinetto was arrested,\r\n and yesterday morning Battista Frescobaldi, who were about to\r\n assassinate the Magnificent Lorenzo de’ Medici with poisoned daggers.\r\n Their ancestors were great people, but these fellows are of no\r\n standing. Moroto was at Rome several days with Count Girolamo (Riario)\r\n and has only just returned; as yet it is not known whether the Count\r\n is mixed up in the affair ... June 3, 1481.[289]\r\n\r\n The confession of these two ruffians who wanted to assassinate the\r\n Magnificent Lorenzo and who were hung this morning at eleven o’clock\r\n in the palace of the Bargello, is that Baptista Frescobaldi, the\r\n man who arrested Bernardo Bandini at Constantinople,[290] told the\r\n Magnificent Lorenzo that he had spent so much for the said arrest\r\n and that he did not consider the Magnificent Lorenzo had paid him\r\n _secundum eius rationem_ and claimed more money, which was refused.\r\n Seeing that he could not revenge himself in any other way six months\r\n ago he determined to murder the said Magnificent Lorenzo. Being at\r\n Rome he spoke about it to Neri Acciaiuoli who encouraged him to do the\r\n evil deed. Moroto being at the same time at Rome the two began to\r\n talk about the government of Florence. Knowing Moroto to be a man of\r\n great courage, Neri persuaded him _ad idem scelsus_. Aware that such\r\n an undertaking could not succeed without accomplices he brought Moroto\r\n and Battista together and thus it was settled. They suggested telling\r\n Count Girolamo,[291] but Neri said it would be better to say nothing\r\n as the Count, having been blamed enough already, would certainly\r\n refuse to join. But he would undertake to provide _quod ille nunquam\r\n deficeret, et etiam_ would get Obietto (del Fiesco) to lend them\r\n men-at-arms, and when everything was ready, would come to Castellina\r\n and double the pay for every eventuality in Romagna. He hinted at\r\n help from other people and said he had influential and well-known\r\n citizens at his back. Now though all this was told to them by Neri,\r\n in their confession they declared they did not much believe in him,\r\n but thought he did it to encourage them. Through him they obtained a\r\n few arms and some money, for it appears that Moroto on being asked\r\n whether he had arms said he had a cuirass in pawn. They were given\r\n certain chain mail, and stuff for poisoning daggers which he brought\r\n to them in a small phial with soap on the top. When they arrived here\r\n they tried, following their instructions, to persuade a few hot-headed\r\n opponents of the government, &c., to join, but without entering into\r\n particulars, save with Francesco Balducci. To him they unbosomed\r\n themselves and he promised every help. Balducci having fled, his\r\n brother, to whom he had told the project, was arrested. It seems that\r\n _post multas cogitationes tandem_ they settled to do the deed on one\r\n of the three days of the coming feast of the Holy Spirit in the church\r\n of S. Liberata, and afterwards to take refuge in some safe house until\r\n part of the people had risen. Then, with a banner taken from a church\r\n with the arms of the Commune, to parade the streets crying “_Viva\r\n il Popolo_,” &c., _et præsertim_ in the lower parts of the city to\r\n breach casks of wine for the poor. Battista was deputed to give the\r\n blow, the other two were to defend him. It appears Moroto only joined,\r\n persuaded by the words of Neri, for the honour and glory of the thing.\r\n They are considered _hominis insani_. The shirts of mail belonging\r\n to them were found. This is all that is known of their confession\r\n and they say no one else is implicated either here or abroad. Three\r\n have been hung, Francesco Baldovinetto, Moroto, and the brother of\r\n Francesco Balducci.--Florence, June 6, 1481.[292]\r\n\r\nThe ambassador hastened back to Florence and wrote to the Duke.\r\n\r\n I arrived here on the 6th, at one of the night, and found that the\r\n three who had conspired to assassinate Lorenzo had been hung that\r\n morning.... It is stated that they had no sympathisers in the city but\r\n acted like reckless and desperate men ... though they sounded many\r\n they found none willing to listen. I believe people were afraid: but\r\n if the deed had succeeded everything would have been topsy-turvy--of\r\n this I have no doubt. They showed great hopes and determination. When\r\n told they were to die next morning several citizens visited them and\r\n exhorted them to take courage. They answered laughing that they feared\r\n not death, but that they were grieved not to have been able to free\r\n them from such servitude and had only done what any other citizen\r\n ought to do, and that if they were only given two hours of freedom\r\n they would show what they could do. It is supposed, although not\r\n admitted, that others in the city are implicated. They say it does not\r\n appear that they had friends abroad, but from what D. Bernardo said\r\n to Girolamo it is thought that Neri Acciaiuoli was agreed with Count\r\n Girolamo, but did not confide in others. Here, however, they pretend\r\n not to believe this; but suspect it the more because so many of their\r\n enemies have left for Rome.... Your Excellency must know that these\r\n men ought _de jure_ not to have been hung, for as they committed no\r\n overt act they did not deserve death. So the Signoria, together with\r\n the Seventy, determined that it was _crimen lesæ maiestatis_, alleging\r\n that they had tried to curtail liberty and change the government\r\n which depended upon Lorenzo; so it was declared that whoever attacked\r\n Lorenzo commits _crimen lesæ maiestatis_, thus giving to him great\r\n honour. Some say this will rather injure than benefit him, because the\r\n more he is elevated above others the more enemies he will have....\r\n June 9, 1481.[293]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to the_ Duchess Eleonora d’Aragona d’Este _at\r\nFerrara_\r\n\r\n _Illma. Domina mea_,--The duty I owe Your Excellency compels me to\r\n communicate to you the terrible and disastrous blow that has to-day\r\n befallen me through the death of my most beloved mother Madonna\r\n Lucrezia. This leaves me utterly desolate as Your Excellency can\r\n think, for I have lost, not only a mother, but the only person I\r\n could turn to in many vexations and who aided me in many troubles.\r\n It is true that we ought to submit patiently to the will of God, but\r\n in this case my heart refuses to be comforted. I pray He may perhaps\r\n send me patience and comfort, and grant her peace and happiness. Your\r\n Excellency to whom I thus pour out my grief for such a loss, and to\r\n whom I turn for comfort in such sorrow, will understand the state in\r\n which your attached servant, who commends himself to you with all his\r\n heart, finds himself.--Florence, March 25, 1482.

Domine mi_,--Although in tears and in great grief I cannot\r\n but inform Your Excellency of the terrible loss I have sustained by\r\n the death of my most dear mother Madonna Lucrezia; who to-day quitted\r\n this life. I am more full of sorrow than I can say, as besides losing\r\n a mother, at the mere thought of whom my heart breaks, I have lost\r\n the counsellor who took many a burden from off me. It has pleased God\r\n that this should be and we neither can nor ought to contest His will.\r\n Much I grieve that I have not the necessary constancy nor strength of\r\n mind, but I pray our Lord God to grant me patience and to her soul\r\n peace, as I firmly hope He will on account of her upright life. I\r\n write in order that Your Excellency may know the condition in which\r\n is one of his good servants who commends himself to you with all his\r\n heart.--Florence, March 25, 1482.

Sixtus IV., entirely\r\nunder the influence of his nephew Girolamo Riario, had deposed\r\nAntonello Ordelaffi in order to give Forli to Riario, who was known\r\nalso to covet Faenza. This was a direct menace to Florence whose road\r\nto the Adriatic would have been cut off. Ferrara likewise attracted\r\nhim; he visited Venice, where he was received like a king and made a\r\npatrician of the Republic, to plan an attack on Duke Ercole. Venice\r\nwas to take the Duchy of Modena, which belonged to the Duke, while\r\nRiario added Ferrara to his other possessions. A pretext was easily\r\nfound. The Venetians claimed the sole right of supplying salt to North\r\nItaly from Cervia and summoned the Duke to cease collecting it at\r\nComacchio. He refused and war was declared in May 1482. Preparations\r\nfor resisting Riario and Venice, and defending Ferrara, were pushed\r\nforward in feverish haste, as is shown by the letter from the Duke\r\nof Urbino to Lorenzo, while those from Ugolino Baccio relate to that\r\nsimple-minded, scatter-brained Slav, Andrea Zuccalmaglio, a Dominican\r\nArchbishop of Krain. Sent to Rome in 1479 as ambassador by the Emperor\r\nFrederick III. he was intensely shocked by what he saw and did not\r\nhide his feelings. The Pope showed his displeasure and the Archbishop\r\nwas recalled. Before he could leave Rome he was imprisoned in Castel\r\nS. Angelo, and on his release went to Basel determined to proclaim\r\na Council. He assumed the titles of Cardinal and Papal Legate, and\r\nmade a clever notary of Trier, Peter Numagen, his secretary, who in\r\nhis _Gesta Archiepiscopi Crayneris_ describes his master as touched\r\nin the brain. On March 25th he denounced Sixtus IV. during service in\r\nthe cathedral and solemnly proclaimed a Council. On July 20th he cited\r\nthe Pope thus: “Francesco of Savona, son of the devil, you entered\r\nyour Office not through the door, but through the window of simony.\r\nYou are of your father the devil and labour to do your father’s will.”\r\nSixtus excommunicated him and laid Basel under an interdict, of which\r\nno notice was taken. He was both angry and alarmed as he suspected the\r\nEmperor of secretly abetting the Archbishop, while Milan and Florence\r\nsent envoys to see how matters stood. The Florentine evidently at\r\nfirst sided hotly with the Archbishop, and believed in the possibility\r\nof a reforming Council. But Lorenzo was cautious. He left Baccio’s\r\nletters unanswered, to the poor man’s discomfiture. The Archbishop was\r\ndisavowed by the Emperor, and the magistrates refusing to give him up\r\nto the papal Legate he was imprisoned in Basel, and hanged himself in\r\nhis cell in November 1484.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrederick, _Duke of Urbino_, _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice frater carissime_,--By the copy of a letter I have written\r\n to the Illustrious Duke of Ferrara which I send to the Honourable\r\n Eight of the Balìa, Your Magnificence will see that I have had news of\r\n the loss of the fortress of Melara. The enemy evidently means to join\r\n that force with their navy and to follow the course of the river to\r\n attack Ferrara. There is no doubt that if the Illustrious League does\r\n not instantly provide reinforcements in that quarter they may succeed\r\n in their attempt, because that Illustrious Lord is not strong enough\r\n to resist without help as Your Magnificence knows.\r\n\r\n In this state of imminent peril it is imperative that the Honourable\r\n Signoria of Florence should send me in all haste as many men-at-arms\r\n as possible, particularly from Romagna and Valle de Lamone, who are\r\n nearer, and being better trained men are more useful than any others.\r\n As soon as the Illustrious Duke of Milan sends me the foot and horse I\r\n have asked for, I shall advance into the Ferrara territory to keep the\r\n enemy in check. If the Illustrious League provide what, for their own\r\n honour and advantage, is necessary to enable me to confront the enemy\r\n I shall not be found wanting, but there is a great difference between\r\n projecting a thing and carrying it through. I do not enlarge on this\r\n as I know Your Magnificence will understand how important it is, and\r\n _cum omne diligentia_ will give the requisite orders.\r\n\r\n I remind Your Magnificence about hastening to despatch the troops we\r\n arranged were to come into the State of the Signor Constanzio [Sforza]\r\n and into Urbino. This is pressing as I have summoned my men to join\r\n me here, but until those troops arrive they cannot move as our lands\r\n cannot be left defenceless.\r\n\r\n My opinion is that the said Signor Constanzio should advance into\r\n Tuscany and take up a position between Arezzo and Anghiara, which\r\n will not only protect the State of the Honourable Signoria of\r\n Florence, but my own and that of Signor Constanzio and perhaps, if\r\n fortune favours us, be a means of offending the enemy. It would be\r\n a good move and I beg Your Magnificence to send orders from there\r\n without losing a moment. I have already given this same advice to His\r\n Excellency.--Rovere, May 4, 1482.[296]\r\n\r\n\r\nUgolino Baccio, _from Basel, to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice vir_, &c.,--I arrived here on the 14th, and by the aid\r\n of a citizen here, called Giovanni Hermin, very friendly to your\r\n house, was introduced to Craina.[297] I offered him your help in\r\n his undertaking, praising him and alluring him _ut moris est_. After\r\n exchanging many sweet speeches (_chiaverini_) we came at last to\r\n essential matters, to which, although he enlarged _et vultu et verbis_\r\n as much as he could, I do not attach more faith than is necessary\r\n unless he adduces better evidence. He shows nothing from the Emperor\r\n [Frederick III.], which proves there is no great eagerness in that\r\n quarter. He talks much about France and other countries, particularly\r\n about Savoy, but I believe what I see; there are many ruffians to be\r\n found, but I am a cut-throat.\r\n\r\n Who does please me is the chief personage. In capacity, talent, and\r\n doctrine, he seems to be fit for any great enterprise, _et quod magis\r\n me movet_ has great knowledge and experience of the world, for many,\r\n many years he has been employed in grave affairs and honourable\r\n legations.\r\n\r\n _Accedit_ he is a friar, which is the summit, or the adornment, of all\r\n his other qualities, and he has so confident and fearless an air that\r\n he would make a man dance a gagliarda[298] against his will, whoever\r\n he might be.\r\n\r\n Secondly the town chosen pleases me. It is convenient, handsome,\r\n healthy, and there is ample accommodation for congresses, vehicles,\r\n and ships.\r\n\r\n Thirdly the citizens are most well-disposed, which pleases me most\r\n of all. I have proof of this because they will not permit their\r\n priests to observe the interdict and support the Archbishop _quantum\r\n possunt_. Yesterday they despatched their Chancellor to the Emperor to\r\n complain of the Pope _propter interdictum_, and to remind him not to\r\n allow the Council to depart, as if it is not held in Basel it will be\r\n transferred elsewhere to his loss and shame, &c.\r\n\r\n Another of their ambassadors went to the Emperor a month ago and a\r\n courier later with letters. There is as yet no news of either, but\r\n they expect an answer from day to day. The Milanese envoy and I are\r\n idly waiting and do not know what to do with ourselves. We came here\r\n as private persons without any show and have not kept our attendants\r\n with us, in order not to spend much money in case nothing comes of\r\n this business, and so we shall remain for the present.\r\n\r\n If a favourable answer comes we shall present ourselves officially to\r\n the Commune. Perhaps I shall do so before, without the Milanese, as a\r\n guarantee to our persons _in omnem eventum_; particularly as they know\r\n through Craina that I am here for this affair, and it might rather\r\n cause suspicion and give them a bad opinion of me if I do not announce\r\n myself openly and show that I am informed of what is going on. But I\r\n have not yet made up my mind and shall follow God’s inspiration.\r\n\r\n If, owing to the Emperor, the Council is not held here, we have talked\r\n of transferring it to Pisa or elsewhere in Italy. His Paternity does\r\n not think the idea a bad one. Consider about this and let me know.\r\n Pisa would be convenient to the Spaniards and to many other kingdoms,\r\n who perhaps would serve our purpose better than Germany. His Paternity\r\n is ready to do anything to upset the Pope and the Count [Girolamo\r\n Riario]. I have said enough.\r\n\r\n I do not write at any length so that you may not be bored. If\r\n you desire to know more, ask the Eight to show you what I have\r\n written to them with far more details. I commend myself to Your\r\n Magnificence.--Basel, September 20, 1482.[299]\r\n\r\n\r\nUgolino Baccio _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Magnificent Lorenzo,--By the Milanese courier who left this on the\r\n 20th I wrote very fully to the Eight and also to Your Magnificence, of\r\n what had occurred.\r\n\r\n Since then nothing of any importance has happened; things seem more\r\n favourable than otherwise. The adverse Legates have made no sign,\r\n they are still in a Swiss town called Torego, _alias_ Suringg, a long\r\n day’s journey from here. We suppose they do not like to risk coming\r\n here on account of the anger excited by the interdict, and that\r\n they are feeling their way how to approach without danger. This is\r\n the opinion of the Council. Perhaps they have other designs and are\r\n waiting in order to give us a heavier blow. Who knows their secrets?\r\n We have no fear of them, if they have of us; but this is uncertain.\r\n The fact is they have not come, and as things are they would only\r\n arrive here in pieces.\r\n\r\n The citizens are strongly in favour of the Council, and unless forced\r\n by the Emperor I do not think they will let it drop, particularly as\r\n it brings them great gain and honour.\r\n\r\n The ambassador sent to Duke Sigismondo has returned bringing, they\r\n say, a most favourable reply. I know no particulars as yet, for these\r\n people are much more taciturn than we are, and very strict observers\r\n of public honour. Unfortunately that friend of the house of Medici has\r\n been sent on an embassy, so it is hard fishing for secrets. _Tamen si\r\n quid erit, haud diu nos latere potest._\r\n\r\n No reply has yet come from the Emperor. But as the road is long and\r\n there is war in the countries the messenger must traverse this is\r\n not to be wondered at. An answer is expected every day, so it seems\r\n to me that _pendeant leges et Prophetæ_. Other help appears to me\r\n vain. We will see what God sends, and I shall inform you of all _cum\r\n diligentia_. I have suggested Pisa to Monsignore several times in case\r\n Basel fails us, but at present he hopes in Cæsar. Think well about\r\n this so that (_quod Dii prohibeant_) we are not left with our feet out\r\n of both stirrups.\r\n\r\n Monsignore has told the people here that we have come in favour of\r\n their cause, and as on account of the delay of these envoys I feared\r\n they might draw back seeing Monsignore unsupported, I informed the\r\n town council that I was sent officially by our Signoria, presented\r\n the letters, &c., and made a long oration _in favorem Consilii_,\r\n praising the holy enterprise and Craina, and condemning the Sixtine\r\n government, and showing the necessity for a Council; all which they\r\n heard with great pleasure, particularly as I offered not only help and\r\n favour, and embassies and prelates from the Florentines, but promised\r\n to confirm this in their name and in that of the League.\r\n\r\n I am sure that in their _perplexione propter venturos Legato\r\n Pontificiis_ this has comforted their minds, _juxta Terentianum illud,\r\n dum in dubis est animus_, &c.\r\n\r\n They promised to reply _post consultationem_. _Sic res se habent\r\n nunc._ To-day I await them in my house and shall hear their answer.\r\n\r\n _Post scripta._--Four of the members have just been here and in the\r\n name of the Senate praised my speech, and thank the Florentines for\r\n their offers which they reciprocate.\r\n\r\n As to the Council they declare that they are well-disposed towards\r\n the Apostolic See if the Church is reformed _pro Religione et fide\r\n Christi, quam vident in magno periculo vel potius ruina_. They also\r\n affirm that they initiated nothing, but only acted according to the\r\n wishes of the Emperor, from whom an explicit answer is expected in\r\n a few days. When it arrives they will tell me at once so that I can\r\n write to my Signoria who can then send prelates and ambassadors as I\r\n have promised. For this I thanked them with opportune words. I see\r\n that I am everything in their eyes, besides which Craina depends\r\n entirely on me and has not been happy since he entered into this\r\n business until I spoke officially. He will not let me out of his\r\n sight, either to go to the Emperor or elsewhere. A thousand times a\r\n day he raises his hands to heaven thanking God for sending me to him.\r\n You have no idea how intently these Doctors of the University read\r\n the documents I have published. What can I say more? The Pope is more\r\n hated here than he is with us, and if the Emperor does not spoil our\r\n game _non sum sine spe_ to arrive at something.\r\n\r\n This is all I write to-day as I send this by a man who is passing\r\n through in haste. Will Your Magnificence be good enough to make my\r\n excuses to the Eight? Your letter was begun and there is no time to\r\n write another. This must serve also for their Excellencies. I commend\r\n myself to Your Magnificence.--Basel, September 30, 1482.[300]\r\n\r\n\r\nUgolino Baccio _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice vir_, &c.,--By my last of the 24th to the Honourable Eight\r\n Your Magnificence will have seen my hopes and designs, and nothing has\r\n occurred since to alter my opinion about the Council, although there\r\n are doubts as to where it is to be held and as to Craina himself, on\r\n account of the great opposition made by our enemies against God and\r\n justice. I am in great tribulation at not receiving any reply from\r\n Florence to my many letters, sent by trustworthy messengers so long\r\n ago that there has been ample time to send an answer to the first\r\n three.\r\n\r\n Had I only received a hint from Your Magnificence as to the choice of\r\n Pisa about which Craina made me write, I should know which way the\r\n wind blows and how to steer this unsteady bark. But without any reply,\r\n although I know the intentions of Your Magnificence up to a certain\r\n point, I do not know them absolutely, as happens to those who, like\r\n me, have several affairs in hand.\r\n\r\n Although Craina hopes for success here he is feeling his way\r\n elsewhere; if he fails here and can extricate himself he will throw\r\n himself into the arms of him who promises most. Till now I have only\r\n been able to give assurances of my personal aid, promising him support\r\n and favour from the League in order to pacify him. But how do I know\r\n what will be my fate? Perchance the League will have nought to do with\r\n the Council save at Basel, or has some other plan of which I know\r\n nothing. So that although I have a general mandate to do all I can\r\n to help forward the Council, which I, although you do not write, am\r\n doing, yet I do wish for your own particular views, otherwise I grope\r\n in darkness.\r\n\r\n However now we are here making every effort that things should go\r\n forward, and though we found the foundations rather weak we have so\r\n propped the house that we do not fear it will fall at every small\r\n stroke. But if, through the Emperor or the Swiss, Basel was shut to\r\n us, I do not see why the League after such a beginning should abandon\r\n the enterprise. I gave the reasons in other letters, but the decision\r\n lies with others who perhaps are of a contrary opinion.\r\n\r\n I have written a detailed account of what happens to the Eight. My own\r\n impressions, such as they are, I write to Your Magnificence, to whom I\r\n can explain things with more freedom than to such eminent magistrates.\r\n You can therefore guess at the truth; to me it appears that although\r\n there is danger there is also hope.\r\n\r\n _Exitus in Diis est: tamen_ if a month after our arrival here a bishop\r\n had declared for us things would not be so backward or so ill looked\r\n on as they are; even if one was now on the way here so as not to delay\r\n giving medicine to the corpse! _At inquies._ Either the Emperor has\r\n not manifested his approval, what then? or he has not openly turned\r\n against the enterprise. For my designs it would be sufficient to\r\n stay here long enough for things to make a little progress, and then\r\n I would gladly pay ready money for a valid impediment in order to\r\n transfer all to a more convenient spot. I pray Your Magnificence to\r\n take the follies I have written for what they are worth and to judge\r\n and command according to your own wishes. _Ego jussa exequar_ and to\r\n that I commend myself.--Basel, October 25, 1482.[301]\r\n\r\nSixtus IV. had been thoroughly frightened by the threatened Council at\r\nBasel and had also fallen under the influence of his nephew Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere, who feared the growing power of Venice and\r\nwas friendly to the Medici. In December 1482 he hurriedly made peace\r\nwith Naples and Ferrara, and received the Duke of Calabria in the\r\nVatican. Alfonso then started for Ferrara, passing through Florence\r\nearly in January, where he stayed three days in the house of Giovanni\r\nTornabuoni. Venice refused to obey the Pope’s commands to make peace\r\nwith Ferrara, and the city was in dire straits. It was only the\r\nencouragement and advice of Bongianni Gianfigliazzi, the Florentine\r\nambassador, that prevented Duke Ercole from quitting Ferrara and\r\ntaking refuge at Modena. A Congress of the Allies was summoned at\r\nCremona, to which Lorenzo went early in February 1483, in spite of\r\nstrong opposition from his fellow-citizens, who feared he might be\r\nassassinated by his arch-enemy Girolamo Riario. Louis XI. shared these\r\nfears as is seen in his letter. The Congress at Cremona consisted of\r\nthe Cardinal Legate Gonzaga, Alfonso Duke Of Calabria, Lodovico and\r\nAscanio Sforza, Ercole d’Este Duke of Ferrara, Federigo Gonzaga Marquis\r\nof Mantua, Giovanni Bentovoglio of Bologna, Girolamo Riario,[302]\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici, and various envoys.[303]\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis XI., _King of France, to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n My Cousin,--By your letter of January 30th I learn your wishes\r\n regarding your son Giovanni, if I had only known this before the death\r\n of the Cardinal de Rohan I should have done all in my power to please\r\n you. I will gladly do whatever I can when a benefice falls vacant. As\r\n to Ferrara, where you have promised to go, I should have advised you\r\n to abstain, and to be very careful about your personal safety, for I\r\n do not know the people or the place you will be in. I would gladly\r\n have sent an ambassador from here to excuse you. However as you have\r\n promised I leave it to you, to good fortune, and to God.--Written at\r\n Plessis du Parc, February 17, 1482 (1483).\r\n\r\n                                                               Luy.[304]\r\n\r\nThe following tale and poem in Latin (which I have done into prose)\r\nwere sent to Lorenzo by Bartolommeo Scala,[305] who prided himself on\r\nhis literary conceits and on his pure Latinity. I insert them as they\r\nare typical of the conceits of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nBartolommeo Scala _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici _at Bagno a Morba_\r\n\r\n My Patron, greeting,--Last September when I was at Morba, where you\r\n now are, for my gout, I composed a conceit on the nymph Amorba,\r\n childish enough perhaps. If you have time to read this it may not\r\n displease you. Trifles of this kind sometimes give pleasure. Indeed\r\n those who have been with you inform me that you have sought anew the\r\n society of the Muses and are their constant boon companion. Of a truth\r\n they can heal our diseases much more pleasantly than any baths.\r\n\r\n This indeed is attested with perhaps a certain neatness by an apologue\r\n of mine. It is as follows.\r\n\r\n Once upon a time Immortality and Old Age were quarrelling. The cause\r\n was small, the quarrel was and still is a grievous one. Immortality\r\n had reared from the nest a tame jackdaw, cunning, thievish, clever,\r\n with a power of imitating our language not unmusically. She had kept\r\n it in luxury for ninety years. The neighbours actually approved of\r\n it in their enjoyment of the constant jesting and laughter which it\r\n caused. For it used secretly to steal from the tailor’s workboxes\r\n rings and needles and other implements, and then, when the fancy\r\n seized it, all of a sudden gave them back. How the onlookers used\r\n to laugh and applaud when it brought a modest blush to a maiden’s\r\n cheek as she walked along the road by calling with a gentle chuckle Ω\r\n χόρη καλη[306] (it had learnt Greek as well as Latin) Ἡλίου ὡς ὁμοιῷ\r\n φωτί.[307] But Old Age was envious and sent disease, her frequent\r\n minister, and killed the jackdaw. So was war kindled. Then when\r\n Old Age had taken many towns, and sacked many cities, she forced\r\n Immortality at length to take refuge in her citadel.\r\n\r\n Her citadel stands on a high mountain. Its walls and battlements are\r\n of brass, but the rooms of its inner chambers of sweetest-smelling\r\n cedarwood. The enemy is held at bay (and this no one who did not know\r\n would easily believe) by maidens alone, by three maidens with their\r\n songs and verses. Now, could you but extract the harmonies of these\r\n maidens from the letters in which they are written and manage to apply\r\n them to your bare breast and heart, there is nothing so health-giving\r\n against all diseases of body and mind. I commend myself to you.\r\n Farewell.--Florence, April 15, 1484.\r\n\r\n                                             Thy Bartolommeo Scala.[308]\r\n\r\n\r\n“_In Amorpham Nympham_,” _Latin poem by_ Bartolommeo Scala, _sent to_\r\nLorenzo De’ Medici _at Bagno a Morba, April 25, 1484_\r\n\r\n Thou askest who I am, what is my name, and whence comes this hot and\r\n health-giving water that springs perennial? Once I was the loveliest\r\n nymph of these woods. Apollo loved me and gave me the power of curing\r\n all ills. Fleeter of foot than the stag or the roe, I was the most\r\n renowned and the most welcome of the Oread sisters or the Dryads. But\r\n we have long known how cruel and potent is fate, and how unstable are\r\n all things here below. When wandering one day, bow in hand, my quiver\r\n on my shoulder, O unhappy nymph! Cerberus saw me and was inflamed with\r\n brutal lust. Of no avail were my bow, my arrows, or my swift feet.\r\n Furiously he pursued me and deaf to my prayers and tears he seized\r\n me, O unhappy one. In vain I screamed and struggled, and called upon\r\n all the Gods of heaven. Almost vanquished I cried out, imploring aid:\r\n “O you sylvan nymphs, have mercy, hasten to save me.” The goddesses\r\n heard, changed me into a hot stream and thus delivered me from those\r\n ferocious hands. As a spring I still preserve the power bestowed by\r\n Apollo of curing all ills. Phœbus pitied and wept over my fate, and\r\n swore by the Styx to undo thee, O Cerberus. A huge stone, high as a\r\n mountain, surrounded by precipices and broken rocks, was torn asunder\r\n and a yawning and dark cave opened, whence issued a horrid wind\r\n charged with fetid odours. Inside all was putrid, in festering matter\r\n lay the entrails and bones of oxen which he bore while yet alive into\r\n the cave to satiate his rabid hunger. Whilst intent on devouring the\r\n raw flesh and sucking the stream of hot blood, the highborn Archer\r\n wounded him. His torn and bleeding entrails gushed forth. But as he\r\n could change his form at will, Cerberus became a dog. From three\r\n throats came despairing howls and the vapour of burning sulphur when\r\n Apollo hurled him down from the rock into deepest hell, where it is\r\n rumoured that he still retains the semblance of a dog. There, where\r\n the brute sank, remain signs of hell, and they say that sinners are\r\n there drawn down to well-deserved punishment. All around are lakes\r\n of deep mud; mud and sulphur are belched up, and from afar one still\r\n hears the ever-renewed howling of dogs. The rock preserved the name\r\n and the mountain whence it fell is called Cerberus. But I remain\r\n unknown, no kind Muse remembered me and I waited for one to tell of\r\n my woes. Lo he comes, and here he writes a poem for me. Read it, O\r\n pilgrim; then thou wilt know that Amorba is the name of the nymph. The\r\n waters will drive away all illness, let the sick come here and they\r\n will find health.[309]\r\n\r\nLorenzo’s great enemy Sixtus IV. died on August 12, 1484, killed, say\r\ncontemporaries, by a violent fit of anger at the proclamation of the\r\npeace of Bagnolo. The Cardinals entered into Conclave on August 26th,\r\nand three days later Giovanni Battista Cibò, born at Genoa in 1432, was\r\nelected Pope under the name of Innocent VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidantonio Vespucci, _Florentine Ambassador at Rome, to_ Lorenzo de’\r\nMedici _at Florence_\r\n\r\n _Magnifice vir_,--If my letter about the election of the Pope\r\n [Innocent VIII.] was delayed, the fault lies with Antonio Tornabuoni\r\n who sent off the courier without waiting for me. I was at Mass\r\n with the other ambassadors and could not leave before them. The\r\n Milanese courier was despatched by Francesco da Casale and not by the\r\n ambassador. I beg you to excuse me.\r\n\r\n Of the new Pope I will tell you all I have heard. As Cardinal he\r\n passed for a kindly and benign man, and was most courteous to all,\r\n kissing any and all even more than one you know of. His political\r\n experience is small and he is not learned, though not ignorant. He\r\n was always devoted to S. Pietro in Vincula [Giuliano della Rovere,\r\n afterwards Julius II.] and indeed was made a cardinal by his\r\n influence. He is tall, full in the face, about fifty-five years of\r\n age, and very robust. He has a brother, at least one grown-up bastard\r\n son and some daughters, who are married here. As cardinal he did not\r\n agree well with the Count [Girolamo Riario, nephew of the late Pope].\r\n S. Pietro in Vincula is now as good as Pope and will have more power\r\n than under Sixtus if he knows how to steer. The Pope has a Genoese\r\n friar who is said to have a mistress of the house of Cibò, Guelph of\r\n course. Here he has a nephew, a priest, related to Filippo di Nerone,\r\n whose mistress is a certain Maria Clemenza--she was wife to Stoldo\r\n Altoviti. The late Captain of infantry is married to a relation of\r\n his. The Pope seems rather a man in need of advice than one capable of\r\n giving it to others.\r\n\r\n The election took place thus. The Rev. Monsignori of Aragona and\r\n Visconti seeing that they could not effect the election of the\r\n Vice-Chancellor and that he stood on the defence, tried to persuade\r\n him to play their game, and _ante omnia_ reconciled the Camarlingo and\r\n Ursino with S. Pietro in Vincula, towards whom they were beginning\r\n to be friendly, and I think they promised to arrange the affairs\r\n of the Count and of the Camarlingo. Many other promises were made.\r\n First, to the Cardinal of Aragona the Pope gives his own house; to\r\n Messer di Visconti the house belonging to the Count, which the Pope\r\n will pay for, besides 12,000 ducats, the legation of the Patrimony,\r\n and I know not what besides at Castello; to Savello the legation of\r\n Bologna; to Milan that of Avignon; all of which latter legations were\r\n held by S. Pietro in Vincula who consented to everything in order to\r\n carry this business through, he has also renounced certain abbeys to\r\n satisfy others whose names I know not. Colonna will no doubt also be\r\n recompensed, and the Vice-Chancellor has obtained certain things he\r\n wanted in Spain. Noara has had I know what castle. Of others I have\r\n not heard. No doubt there are many similar cases.\r\n\r\n To conclude, this election is attributed entirely to Monsignore di\r\n Visconti and I think you ought to write to him that he should help us\r\n when I have need of aid in your affairs. Also send a proper letter to\r\n S. Pietro in Vincula for he is the only one I have any fear of in\r\n the business of Fonte Dolce,[310] he is the Pope, _et plusquam Papa_.\r\n Believe me that Monsignori Aragona and Visconti will plunder this\r\n court at every election, they are the two biggest scoundrels in the\r\n world.\r\n\r\n In a few days I shall begin to adjust your affairs and shall succeed,\r\n as in the beginning these princes and popes are usually very gracious,\r\n and His Holiness is well disposed towards you and has always been very\r\n friendly to me. Remember before the new Signori are named to have my\r\n leave arranged as I want to be at home during September, and I hope\r\n you will grant my desire that my Simone should be made one of the\r\n Eight.--Roma, August 29, 1484. Remember also to push on the enterprise\r\n of Sarzana, afterwards there might be danger.[311]\r\n\r\nAccording to custom the Republic of Florence sent an embassy to\r\ncongratulate Innocent VIII. on his nomination. With them went Lorenzo’s\r\neldest son, Piero, then fourteen years of age, to whom his father wrote\r\nthe following letter containing minute instructions as to his speech\r\nand conduct. From Lorenzo’s remark, “Though thou art my son, thou art\r\nbut a citizen of Florence,” and his impressing upon him to be polite\r\nand not to take precedence of his elders, one sees he was already\r\nanxious about the boy’s overbearing, turbulent temper.\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to his son_ Piero _in Rome, November 26, 1484_\r\n\r\n Thou wilt have only four letters of introduction for Siena, one to\r\n Messer Paulo di Gherardo, one to Messer Cristofano di Guido, and\r\n one to Messer Andrea Piccolomini, whom thou art to visit at their\r\n houses and there deliver the letters to them. Commend me to Their\r\n Magnificences, using the same words to all, thus: that passing through\r\n Siena on thy way to Rome with these ambassadors I charged thee to\r\n visit Their Magnificences whom I love and revere as fathers; that I\r\n hope they will regard thee as a son, command thee at any time or in\r\n any place, as I do, and that thou wilt obey them; and that as they\r\n can dispose of my property, State, and children, of whom thou art\r\n one, thou presentest thyself to them as being theirs to dispose of\r\n according to their pleasure. Use proper words to this effect without\r\n affectation or constraint, and do not try to appear learned with them\r\n or with others, but speak graciously, pleasantly, and seriously.\r\n\r\n Thou wilt have a list of Sienese citizens to whom, if there is time,\r\n thou art to pay visits, using the same words I have already indicated\r\n and offering me to them, as well as to the three above-named, for the\r\n protection of their State, all the more that our city is of this mind.\r\n\r\n When together with other youths of the ambassadors bear thyself\r\n sedately, politely, and kindly, towards thy equals. Be careful not to\r\n take precedence of those who are thine elders, for although thou art\r\n my son, thou art but a citizen of Florence, as they are. When Giovanni\r\n [Tornabuoni] thinks fit to present thee to the Pope privately first\r\n inform thyself well of all the needful ceremonies, then when presented\r\n to His Sanctity kiss my letter which will be given thee for the Pope,\r\n entreating him to deign to read it. When it is thy turn to speak,\r\n first place me at the feet of His Beatitude, saying that I am aware it\r\n was my duty to prostrate myself in person at the feet of His Holiness,\r\n as I did at those of his Predecessor of saintly memory; but that I\r\n trust in his goodness to forgive me, because at that time I had my\r\n brother who was well able to fill my place, whereas at present I have\r\n no man of greater years and authority than thyself, and therefore I do\r\n not think it would have been pleasing to His Holiness if I had left\r\n Florence. Say that I send thee in my stead as the strongest proof I\r\n could give of my desire to go in person. Besides other reasons also\r\n I have sent thee in order that thou shouldst learn early to regard\r\n His Beatitude as thy Father and Lord, and be encouraged to continue\r\n in this devotion, in which I educate my other children, whom I would\r\n rather not have if they were not so inclined. Then thou wilt inform\r\n His Holiness that I am firmly resolved not to transgress his commands,\r\n because, besides my natural devotion to the Holy See, my devotion to\r\n His Beatitude himself arises from many causes and from obligations\r\n which ever since I was _in minoribus_ our house has received from\r\n him. Add that I have experienced how hurtful it has been to be out\r\n of favour with the late Pontiff although, as it seems to me, I was\r\n unjustly persecuted rather for others’ sins than for any insult or\r\n offence to him of holy memory. But I leave this to the judgment of\r\n others. Be it as it may I am firmly determined, not only not to offend\r\n His Beatitude in any way, but to think day and night on what I can\r\n do to please him; thus I trust that the joy and pleasure which the\r\n nomination of His Beatitude to the Pontificate caused me will endure\r\n for long, and I supplicate His Beatitude to accept me and my children\r\n and all that is mine as his humble sons and servants, and to preserve\r\n to us his grace, inasmuch as we shall make every effort to deserve his\r\n goodwill.\r\n\r\n After this thou art to say to His Holiness that having thus\r\n recommended me, brotherly love constrains thee to recommend also\r\n Messer Giovanni, whom I have brought up as a priest, and endeavour to\r\n educate morally and intellectually in such a way that he should not\r\n be put to shame among others. All my hope in this matter is in His\r\n Beatitude who has already, out of his clemency and humanity, shown\r\n him some affection, and as we are in his good graces I entreat him\r\n to continue his benevolence, and to add to the other obligations our\r\n house has towards the Holy See by favouring this affair of Messer\r\n Giovanni; strive with these and other words to recommend thy brother.\r\n I have now said enough about the Pope. Thou wilt have my letters\r\n to all the cardinals which thou wilt deliver or not according to\r\n Giovanni’s directions. Commend me to them and say thou art come to\r\n Rome to express my devotion to Their Most Reverend Lords, and also in\r\n order that they may make acquaintance with him who will continue the\r\n devotion of our house towards them, and that they are to command thee\r\n and make use of thee as of all that is mine, offering thyself, &c.\r\n This thou wilt say to all in general, but to those on the marked list\r\n thou wilt say as follows.\r\n\r\n To Cardinal Visconti say that even were he not a Cardinal, our house\r\n has old and innate obligations to all his illustrious house, and that\r\n as my son and by nature an ally of the Sforzas (Sforzesco), and a\r\n devoted servant of His Most Reverend Lordship thou beseechest him to\r\n command thee, and to treat thee as one of his house and accept thee as\r\n his servant, as are all of our house.\r\n\r\n To Cardinal d’Aragona say that as I place all my hopes and trust in\r\n H.M. the King his father, it is thy duty as my son to present thyself\r\n to His Most Reverend Lordship, and that thou and my other sons,\r\n besides the many benefits received from H.M. the King, can never\r\n forget the honours paid to me at Naples and the mode of sending me\r\n home, and that thou art well aware what would have been thy condition\r\n and that of my other children, if things had gone differently. For\r\n this reason His Most Reverend Lordship and all the other sons of\r\n H.M. the King may sell thee, or pawn thee, and treat thee as a thing\r\n belonging to them.\r\n\r\n To Cardinal Orsini say that I have sent thee to Rome for him to see\r\n how offshoots of their tree prosper in our soil and what fruit they\r\n bear, and that, such as they are, I send the first-fruit to His Most\r\n Reverend Lordship, and that although an unworthy son of the house\r\n of Orsini thou desirest, such as thou art, to be a servant of His\r\n Reverence, to whom as head of the house thou art willing and ready,\r\n during thy whole life as far thou canst, to repay the obligations thou\r\n art under to his noble house, which are indeed great, as thou owest\r\n thy being to it. For this reason thou art come to beg him as head,\r\n &c., to take thee under his care and to instruct thee, for thy honour\r\n and success will reflect upon him as much as upon me, thy father;\r\n commend to him Clarice and thy brothers and sisters, &c.\r\n\r\n To the cardinals who are related to the Orsini, as I think are the\r\n Savelli, Conti, and Colonna, thou wilt make use of more familiar\r\n language than to the others, saying that besides other obligations\r\n I have towards them, we are, by the grace of God, related to their\r\n noble families, which I consider as one of the chief ornaments of\r\n our house. To Monsignore our Archbishop of Florence thou art to show\r\n all these instructions before making any visits, which on account of\r\n thine age may be very short ones. I hope that His Lordship, being\r\n better informed and more prudent, will add anything needful, assuring\r\n him that what I say is not merely formal but the truth, and do either\r\n more or less than his Lordship directs, as though it was I who told\r\n thee. At all events thou art to visit all the Orsini who are in Rome,\r\n speaking with due reverence, commending me to Their Lordships and\r\n offering thyself as their son and servant, they having deigned to\r\n become our relations by which thou art the chief gainer as being of\r\n higher birth, and therefore it is but right thou shouldst strive to\r\n repay them. I send thee with Giovanni Tornabuoni, whom thou art to\r\n obey in all things and not to presume to do aught without him. Be\r\n modest and kindly in manner towards him and every one, and strive to\r\n bear thyself with sedateness, all the more that sedateness is not a\r\n youthful virtue. The honours and flatteries that will be bestowed upon\r\n thee will be a great danger if thou art not discreet and rememberest\r\n who thou art. If Gugliemo [de’ Pazzi] or his sons or grandsons come\r\n to see thee receive them kindly, but quietly, showing sorrow for\r\n their condition and encouraging them to act well and to hope for\r\n better things by so doing. Should Monsignore our Archbishop think it\r\n right for thee to go to any place outside Rome to visit any of the\r\n Orsini, thou canst do so; obey His Lordship in this and in everything,\r\n as I have already said, as thou wouldst obey me. Tell Gugliemo that\r\n Bianca[312] having written in my name, and in that of Bernardo\r\n Rucellai, to ask him to give up the Canonry of Pisa to her for a\r\n certain exchange she wishes to make, he ought to do it, particularly\r\n as Bernardo offers to serve him and to help him in whatever way he\r\n thinks best. Impress this upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\nNiccolò Michelozzi _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici _at Morba_\r\n\r\n I send this horseman, not because the enclosed letters are of any\r\n great importance, but because all your people, both those of your\r\n house and your friends, wish to have news of you: though in all hope\r\n is great, yet the desire will only be appeased by news of you and\r\n of good results [from the baths]. Give orders therefore that your\r\n secretaries write often.\r\n\r\n Antonio Tornabuoni informs me that this morning the Captain of\r\n infantry was sent to Romagna, we think he will do well what is\r\n necessary, and at Pietrasanta ...[313] to fly from peril.\r\n\r\n The Doge of Genoa writes that a safe-conduct for eight days has been\r\n given to Francesco Centurione, principally because some persons have\r\n an idea that he comes for a purpose and is not merely passing through.\r\n You will be the first to know whether he is the bearer of anything.\r\n\r\n Sassetto tells me he has, by your orders, replied to the letter from\r\n Amaretto in Venice to you, and has told him to come here.\r\n\r\n From the letters from Rome you will understand about the Pope, who has\r\n been trying to trick us.\r\n\r\n Pier Filippo tells me that they intend to send a Commissary to Pisa\r\n who can if necessary also act at Leghorn and at Pietrasanta, a man of\r\n resolution. They think of sending Piero di Lutozzo and of recalling\r\n Piero Capponi and Piero Vettori, who have both asked to be recalled,\r\n particularly Pier Capponi because Gino is not well; if you have any\r\n one else to suggest send word, for there is still time.\r\n\r\n Alberghetto says he is ready to make those four small cannon for you\r\n if you will give him the materials; thus he will not lose his time\r\n on public things, in which he has been very ill-treated; they don’t\r\n pay him, they give him no work, and they drive him to despair. I have\r\n helped him and shall do all I can for him.\r\n\r\n Tell Madonna Clarice that Piero and all the other children are as\r\n well as ever I saw them, and I hope they will continue so. Do your\r\n best to recover and return soon quite cured and in good health, then\r\n everything else will go well.\r\n\r\n On ’Change money is abundant for everywhere, save Lyons, for which\r\n place all the merchants are buyers, particularly those who used to be\r\n sellers. I think some one must be working to send supplies by some\r\n other channel. But I do not understand these things, or know whether\r\n it is true, still I think you ought to be informed of everything:\r\n if my news bores you, either tell me, or tell Ser Piero to open my\r\n letters and not to show them to you.\r\n\r\n Do order them to write often to us. I commend myself to you.--In\r\n Florence the last day of the year 1484 (24th March 1485).\r\n\r\n Ser Francesco sends you an abstract of what little there is of public\r\n matters.\r\n\r\n                                                Niccolò Michelozzi.[314]\r\n\r\n\r\nMatteo Franco _to_ Ser Piero Dovizi Da Bibbiena, _Chancellor of Lorenzo\r\nde’ Medici, wherever he may be_\r\n\r\n _Salve, o alter ego._\r\n\r\n Good-bye Ser Piero, good-bye Franco, good-bye Lorenzo, Butti,\r\n Franceschi, good-bye, good-bye, &c. We parted at Capitulo near Bagno\r\n a Morba. Florence having quitted Pisa,[315] we came gaily singing\r\n and joking to the mill on this side of Monte Castelli, where we\r\n found twenty-five soldiers with shields and spears whom we had seen\r\n from above, when we said to one another, “Who are those fellows down\r\n there?” and we all shouted “_Palle, Palle_”; they replied, “_Palle,\r\n Palle e Orso, Orso_,” and as we came nearer the shouts of _Palle_\r\n and _Orso_ redoubled. We then saw they were men sent from Monte\r\n Castelli to escort us, &c. They wanted us to enter the townlet, but we\r\n declined, so they came with us down into the plain where was a crowd\r\n of women with faces as wrinkled as chestnut cakes, but all very merry\r\n and happy with tables spread out with wine, puff pastry, &c. We drank\r\n in haste, and keeping one of the soldiers as a guide discharged the\r\n others, and went on our journey singing and chatting gaily. Passing by\r\n deserted Monte Guidi, half-way down the hill we met a priest with his\r\n frock tucked up and so out of breath he might have come from Assisi,\r\n who said he was a friend of Donnino,[316] and implored us to dismount\r\n at his church and house, he was so exhausted and ran up and down so\r\n incessantly, that if he did not go and be bled I fear that by this\r\n time he is no more. God help him. We left, or rather we did not stop,\r\n and passed down below Casoli without entering, and about four miles\r\n this side of the village Martino Ghezo and Martino Moro caught us up,\r\n not having been able to keep up with us as we rode fast. They told\r\n us that on the other side of Casoli they met the so-much-longed-for\r\n Nannina[317] in a carriage, and that she asked about Lorenzo and\r\n Madonna Clarice. Hearing that Madonna Clarice had passed, and that\r\n Lorenzo had gone to Pisa, she was, they said, in despair, and showed\r\n great sorrow at not having seen Lorenzo, or even having been able to\r\n talk to Madonna Clarice. When Madonna heard this she several times\r\n lamented the bad luck of their missing each other, &c.\r\n\r\n And thus, till about two miles from Colle di Val d’Elsa, we continued\r\n singing, joking, and talking. Then we became almost dumb, for nearly\r\n all our words migrated into a brother of Antonio del Pela who came\r\n to meet us, and conducted us into the tumbledown and ruined village\r\n of Colle to the house of the said Antonio. He came forward with such\r\n a river and flood of words that he drowned his brother, and us, and\r\n all who were near, and showed that he was truly the elder and the\r\n better brother. On entering the hall we found about thirty-five\r\n members of his family--girls, women, and children. My bore immediately\r\n began: “Madonna Clarice, this is my daughter, come forward, kiss the\r\n lady’s hand; and this is my granddaughter, come forward, touch her\r\n gown. And this one, and this one. And these little ones are all my\r\n grandchildren; hold yourselves up, think of your manners; this one is\r\n to be a priest, this one a nun, to this one Madonna Lucrezia stood\r\n godmother, this one I have just given in marriage, this one makes\r\n Venetian fringe, that one lace.” Plague take him. If I had not pulled\r\n him away he would have cast a spell on us all. But by asserting how\r\n tired Madonna Clarice and we all were I managed to damp his ardour.\r\n We arrived about twenty-two or twenty-three of the clock, and after\r\n resting we went to see paper made,[318] and returned to fetch Madonna\r\n Clarice, who thought it a pretty thing, and was much interested in\r\n the machines, the water, the air, &c. Then we went back and supped\r\n about one of the clock: a few wafers, cakes, and trebbiano,[319] salad\r\n and pickles, boiled fowl, and kid: and then young pigeons roasted, and\r\n I know not what preparation of fowl, marzipan, sweets, and comfits, &c.\r\n\r\n Before supper the Commune of Colle made an offering to Madonna of\r\n corn, marzipan, wine, sweetmeats, &c., presented by eloquent orators,\r\n three out of the number. The substance was that as Lorenzo, whom\r\n they had expected, had not come, they presented all to her as being\r\n a second Lorenzo, with many excuses for the smallness of the gift\r\n owing to their poverty, and begged her to commend them and the town to\r\n Lorenzo. Madonna, by God, replied well and briefly, saying that they\r\n were not friends as they declared, for had they been they would have\r\n known that Lorenzo and herself would protect them without expecting\r\n gifts, which were rather things pertaining to strangers than to good\r\n friends. “On the one hand, you complain and ask me to represent to\r\n Lorenzo the poverty and the needs of yourselves and of your town, and\r\n then you spend money in these things. I take the will for the deed and\r\n give all back to you; for if I kept them I should only give them to\r\n the town for the love of God, so I bestow them on you who are poorer\r\n than I.” There was a great ado because they steadfastly refused to\r\n take the things away, alleging that there were plots against them,\r\n &c. Ser Giovanni Antonio and I sent them back by some of our people,\r\n keeping four flasks of wine and some marzipan to content them, and to\r\n show we wished them well.\r\n\r\n We slept right well, and though Pela broke our heads with his idle\r\n chatter, I must say he received us with great courtesy and affection:\r\n and, after all, a good heart is to be admired more than other things.\r\n\r\n In the evening after supper there appeared a certain Messer Ricco,\r\n an envoy from Siena, who remained with Madonna Clarice and Messer\r\n Giovanni Antonio for half-an-hour, talking about the rising at Siena.\r\n He said that Lorenzo had written that he was leaving Bagno with his\r\n wife, but did not say where he was going, so he thought to find him\r\n here. I know Ser Giovanni Antonio was satisfied with the report given\r\n by the envoy so I say no more.\r\n\r\n Before leaving in the morning Messer Giovanni Antonio and I paid a\r\n visit to the Podestà. Then with a guide we came to Tavernelle and then\r\n to Pasignano, where Donnino had preceded us; we reached there about\r\n fifteen of the clock. After resting awhile we dined: liver and lights,\r\n boiled kid, broad beans, curds and good wine, and then we visited\r\n the whole house, the church, and the relics. Madonna Clarice was\r\n more pleased than I can say with the house and with her room. There\r\n we stayed all day seeing different things. Our supper was salad, an\r\n excellent herb pie, fried curds, broad beans and cheese, &c.\r\n\r\n In the morning, that is yesterday morning, we left directly after\r\n mass, coming by the S. Casciano road. Just under Fabrica a man\r\n galloped up, saying: “Your Piero sends me to find out by which road\r\n you are coming, for yester evening he came out several miles to meet\r\n you, and has now gone with Messer Giovanni and all the others towards\r\n S. Maria Impruneta.” We replied that we were bound to S. Casciano. He\r\n flew off to bear the message, and at last on this side of S. Casciano,\r\n as we were crossing the river, we met Jacopo Salviati and his friend\r\n Tommasino de’ Corbinelli, who greeted us with great joy, and rode back\r\n with us. Then near the Certosa we met paradise full of festive and\r\n joyous angels, that is to say, Messer Giovanni and Piero, and Giuliano\r\n and Giulio on pillions, with all their attendants. As soon as they saw\r\n their mother they threw themselves from their horses, some without\r\n help, others aided by their people, and they ran forward and were\r\n lifted into the arms of Madonna Clarice, with such joy and kisses and\r\n delight that a hundred letters could not describe it. Even I could\r\n not restrain myself but got off my horse, and ere they remounted I\r\n embraced them all twice; once for myself and once for Lorenzo. Darling\r\n little Giuliano said, with a long O, O, O, “Where is Lorenzo?” We\r\n said, “He has gone to Poggio to find you.” Then he: “O no, never,”\r\n almost in tears. You never beheld so touching a sight. He and Piero,\r\n who has become a beautiful lad, the prettiest thing, by God, you ever\r\n saw, somewhat grown, with the profile of an angel, and rather long\r\n hair which stands out a little and is charming to see. Giuliano, red\r\n and fresh as a rose, smooth, clear, and bright as a mirror, joyous\r\n and with those contemplative eyes. Messer Giovanni also looks well,\r\n not much colour, but healthy and natural; and Giulio has a brown and\r\n healthy complexion.[320] All, in short, were happiness itself. And\r\n thus with great joy and delight we went a happy party by Via Maggio,\r\n Ponte a S. Trinità, S. Michele Berteldi, S. Maria Maggiore, Canto alla\r\n Paglia, Via de’ Martelli, and entered the house, _per infinita asecula\r\n aseculorum eselibera nos a malo amen_. I then rode to my own house,\r\n and I have not seen them since as I found many things to do. Nothing\r\n more.\r\n\r\n Luigi left Florence this morning and went to Calcione or Balcione\r\n or whatever his place is called, and his wife is in Florence. Tell\r\n Francesco di Maestro Antonio,[321] my beloved and beautiful, that he\r\n had his letter, was much pleased by it, and says he will reply by word\r\n of mouth, as there was nought in it of moment he did not answer, but\r\n begs him to forgive him, he will do it better in person. Take note of\r\n this.\r\n\r\n To my Andrea de’ Medici commend me with all thy might and tell him not\r\n to forget my sea-shells. And come back soon for the people can no\r\n longer retain their impatience. In haste.--May 12, 1485.\r\n\r\n                                                                 Franco.\r\n\r\n I gave thy garter to the man thou toldest me. I quite understand that\r\n he has not pleased the person who you said praised him: so that what\r\n with this and our conversation in the fields I think it would be an\r\n excellent thing to do as we decided. By word of mouth we will settle\r\n all. _Vale iterum._\r\n\r\n Say to Francesco that I went to his house and told his old woman that\r\n he was well and would be at Poggio on Monday, at which she rejoiced.\r\n I also went to the house of my Andrea de’ Medici: his womankind were\r\n at vespers, but I saw the baby girl who was being fed; the sweetest\r\n little fish in the world, she looks like a rose: and I left word that\r\n he was well and would return on Monday. Commend me to him.\r\n\r\n                        _Two of Piero’s Sayings_\r\n\r\n Returning from the festival at the Carmine together we passed my\r\n house, so he came in and had some breakfast, and when we left as he\r\n was putting on his _catelano_ [overcoat] I said: “Piero, will you\r\n not drink a little more?” When his coat was well on he said: “Yes,\r\n just a little so as not to smell of Catelano,”[322] which made us\r\n all laugh. The other: Passing near S. Maria Novella the house of\r\n that Ser Francesco who kept a school for boys, and seeing that now a\r\n carpenter was standing at the door which was open so that we could\r\n see wood piled up inside, I said: “Oh dear, Ser Francesco who kept\r\n the school must be dead,” and the carpenter answered that he was. I\r\n exclaimed: “The devil! I am grieved for him!” Piero said: “Why ‘the\r\n devil’? did you wish him to live more years than a life? He must have\r\n been eighty.” We laughed all the way to Piazza Madonna. I thought he\r\n had heard this and only repeated it, but looking at him I saw by his\r\n laughing face that he had said it of himself and on purpose.\r\n\r\n Lorenzo declares (and it makes me laugh) that he will not have Piero\r\n bothered, &c.; the poor lad cannot go outside the door without all\r\n Florence running after him; it is the same at home, they all try to\r\n make him shine, though with decorum, on which he insists. But they\r\n don’t care. It is of no use; they are all enthusiastic and cannot hold\r\n their tongues. When Lorenzo goes out he will have to lock the boy in a\r\n cupboard if he does not want to hear questions put to him to answer.\r\n I cannot tell you what charm there is about him, so that all who talk\r\n for a while with him are captivated.[323]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to the_ Duke Ercole d’Este\r\n\r\n _Illme. Domine mi_,--Your Excellency has in your library a book by\r\n an historian named Dione, _de Romanis historiis_, which I have an\r\n extreme desire to see, both on account of the consolation I derive\r\n from history and also because my son Piero, who has some knowledge\r\n of Greek literature, has begged me to get this book for him to read,\r\n which I understand is very rare in Italy.[324] Your Excellency can\r\n understand how grateful I shall be for the loan of it for a few days,\r\n and therefore I beg you to grant my request and with all eagerness\r\n I expect the book. I commend myself to Your Excellency.--Florence,\r\n February 5, 1485 (1486). Your Excellency’s servant,\r\n\r\n                                             Laurentius de Medicis.[325]\r\n\r\nLorenzo not only borrowed but lent books in liberal fashion. Poliziano\r\nwas his librarian with a certain Meo _cartolaio_ as his assistant,\r\nwho bound the manuscripts. Poliziano himself, Pico della Mirandola,\r\nMesser Demetrio the Greek (Chalcondylas), John Lascaris, and Bernardo\r\nMichelozzi, afterwards Bishop of Forlì, were among the most frequent\r\nborrowers, and every book taken out of the library, even by Lorenzo\r\nor his sons, was noted down in his _Epistolario_. Not only books,\r\nbut arms, silver dishes, bowls, goblets, salt-cellars, spoons, and\r\nforks, were lent to various Podestà and to friends, even the Signoria\r\nof Florence occasionally borrowed from him. The silver Lorenzo took\r\nwith him on hunting excursions or to the various baths he visited was\r\ncarefully recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Guidone Aldrovandini, _Ambassador to the Republic of Florence\r\nfrom Ferrara, to_ Duke Ercole d’Este\r\n\r\n Yesterday evening at one of the night the Magnificent Lorenzo returned\r\n and to-day I went to see him. His Magnificence said that during these\r\n few days of absence he found that Milan had made observations about\r\n the Signoria having despatched Ugolino Baccio, a private gentleman\r\n of no official standing, to the Illustrious Duke of Calabria without\r\n notifying the fact to the government of Milan; and that it seemed to\r\n him that Milan and the Lord Lodovico did not remember that this city\r\n called herself the city of liberty, and that she would be indeed in\r\n evil plight if she could not send a man wherever she chose without\r\n the permission of Milan, particularly when despatched to the Duke of\r\n Calabria. Also that this city made no remark when the Lord Lodovico\r\n made a treaty with Venice without informing this Signoria ... all\r\n these things showed a rancorous and evil disposition.... That if Milan\r\n ever needed help from here ... and in desperate need turned to this\r\n people ... it would be impossible to persuade them to listen to her\r\n request. He said that Villa was of no value to Milan, while to this\r\n Signoria the place was of great importance, for if they lose hold of\r\n that district and were at war with Genoa, instead of spending ten they\r\n would have to spend sixty and even more.... He could not understand\r\n whence arose the hatred shown by Milan to this Signoria and the\r\n explosion of rage at the acquisition of a place of no importance. This\r\n Signoria did not act thus towards Milan, nor towards the Marquis of\r\n Mantua, nor towards Your Lordship; they have always aided, and spent\r\n much treasure in trying to help all these princes to enrich themselves\r\n at the expense of Venice. If this did not succeed it was not the fault\r\n of this Signoria, who did all they could to aid in the matter. It\r\n therefore seems strange to them that there should be such grumbling\r\n about Villa. I then touched upon what Your Excellency wrote to me.\r\n That it was not thought that Milan would again demand the restitution\r\n of Villa but would wait until this Signoria decided upon attacking\r\n Sarzana, when Villa would naturally fall to them.... His Magnificence\r\n replied: “I will tell you all openly, only beg Your Lord to keep it\r\n secret. This you must know has been thought of, but this city is not\r\n inclined to undertake the enterprise of Sarzana during the next few\r\n years, but to temporise until our affairs are more prosperous, for\r\n we are quite aware that the Lord Lodovico has made an alliance with\r\n Genoa, and that we could not count on help from him. The Lord Lodovico\r\n shows that he does not understand the spirit that rules this city,\r\n which is this: When we have embarked on an enterprise we continue\r\n with ardour, when we are at peace it needs a great effort to make us\r\n undertake one. Now that the Signoria has sheathed the sword it will\r\n not unsheath it, save for very grave reasons. We know that 60,000\r\n ducats would not suffice for an attempt on Sarzana.”... November 4,\r\n 1486.[326]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuke Ercole d’Este _to_ Messer Aldrovandini, _Ambassador of Ferraro to\r\nthe Republic of Florence_\r\n\r\n Messer Aldrovandini,--As soon as you receive this our letter contrive\r\n to see the Magnificent Lorenzo _solus cum solo_, and inform him most\r\n secretly that we are advised by our ambassador at Venice that a\r\n Genoese envoy has arrived there in disguise, with secret instructions\r\n from his prince, and his ambassador has asked that Illustrious\r\n Signoria to enter into a treaty, and to give counsel and aid against\r\n the Magnificent Signoria of Florence. Not desiring to make this\r\n public, but on the contrary to keep it secret, they requested the\r\n Illustrious Signoria of Venice to let Signor Roberto [San Severino]\r\n enter his service, to whom his Commune offers 20,000 men for making\r\n war against the Florentines. He complained that the Illustrious\r\n Lord Lodovico kept his ambassadors some time in Milan and sent them\r\n home without concluding anything, on the pretext that he wanted to\r\n reconcile them with the Florentines, towards whom they say he is too\r\n tender. It has been determined not to give an immediate answer to this\r\n envoy but to keep him amused with hopes until it is known whether the\r\n league and friendship which is now being arranged between the Pope and\r\n the Signoria is concluded. To accelerate this the Signoria of Venice\r\n have sent Antonio Vinciguerra their secretary in all haste to Rome,\r\n who passed through here three nights ago on his way to Ravenna, where\r\n horses were ready to take him to Rome. With him went a secretary of\r\n the Legate, who is at Venice, sent by the Legate, so that by what we\r\n see and hear the affair is on the point of being concluded unless\r\n steps can be taken to stop it. Of the important results to Italian\r\n matters, _et presentim_ to our Illustrious League, I leave the\r\n Magnificent Lorenzo to judge. I beg you _ex corde_ to keep this news\r\n secret, for if by chance it was known from whence it came, besides the\r\n danger our ambassador at Venice would run, you would lose the benefit\r\n of being advised of matters which deeply concern that Illustrious\r\n Signoria and His Magnificence.--Ferrara, November 18, 1486.[327]\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Guidone Aldrovandini, _Ambassador of Ferrara to the Republic of\r\nFlorence, to the_ Duke Ercole d’Este\r\n\r\n This evening about 24 of the clock came the letter of Your Illustrious\r\n Lordship. I went at once to the Magnificent Lorenzo and read him\r\n the whole letter, entreating him in Your Excellency’s name to keep\r\n it absolutely secret. When His Magnificence heard it I assure Your\r\n Lordship that he remained for a time without opening his lips from\r\n agony and rage, and then said: “I believe all that is evil of this\r\n Pope, the more so that to-day I heard from Rome that S. Piero in\r\n Vincula is going to Padua on the pretence of fulfilling a vow, but\r\n really in order to conclude a league with the Venetians and settle\r\n everything.” Then he added: “This ecclesiastical State has always\r\n been the ruin of Italy, because being ignorant and not knowing how to\r\n govern, the priests put the whole world in peril. If His Majesty puts\r\n an end to the Barons, he will then teach the Pope to read.” About the\r\n news that Signor Roberto was to lead the Genoese against him, &c.,\r\n he did not seem to care much, or to hold them in much estimation,\r\n saying that they would need other men than the crews of galleys. He\r\n then said: “If Signor Roberto is to be the instrument of this it is\r\n not serious.” By these words I gathered that His Magnificence did not\r\n greatly fear Signor Roberto on account of the friendship existing\r\n between them and that he meant, according to my poor judgment, that\r\n Signor Roberto would not make war on Florence; though he did not\r\n express himself clearly.--Florence, November 20, 1486.[328]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Ugolino Baccio _in Apulia_\r\n\r\n To Baccio.\r\n\r\n I have yours of the 18th, 22nd, and 29th, and now answer what is most\r\n important. As to the understanding between the Pope and the King I\r\n have no fear that it will cause me trouble; for if I thought the\r\n King did not understand the difference between one who has seriously\r\n offended him and one who has aided him with all his might, I should\r\n not have advised this city to help him. The confirmation of the\r\n custom we have adopted of making princes of the relatives of Popes\r\n displeases me, because I have experienced the evils it gives rise to,\r\n and know that the more esteem one shows for others the less is shown\r\n to oneself, and that one example entails others. I have come to the\r\n conclusion that a union between Milan, ourselves, and the house of\r\n Orsini would be to our advantage and to theirs, and anything that\r\n indicates greater faith in others than in us weakens this bond. But\r\n as the Lord Virginio [Orsini] is of a different opinion I give way,\r\n particularly as Messer Gianjacopo [Trivulzio, Sforza’s general], who\r\n is as prudent and expert as Papi Tani, is of his way of thinking. I\r\n do not however repent of having spoken fully and openly about this,\r\n unless the King or the Duke have taken offence, in which case I had\r\n rather have bitten my tongue.\r\n\r\n As to the other part of your letter in which you say you have heard\r\n from Milan that the Duke has been told I am displeased at his seeking\r\n to protect himself and obtain a following, it is false, and no man who\r\n speaks the truth can say it. Give the Duke to understand that if I\r\n believed that the frauds and lies of others would find credence with\r\n His Excellency as against my actions, I think I should go and live\r\n with the Turk. The proof of what my desire has been is that I always\r\n counselled the Duke by letter, and in person at Citerna, to take\r\n Colonessi into his service, and persuaded the Lord Virginio that this\r\n was the proper thing. It appears to me unnecessary to make excuses, as\r\n it might give rise to the idea that I was in fault, of which I am as\r\n free as the day I was born. I am I think known as an upright man and\r\n loyal, and one to be trusted by the Duke as fully as any man alive for\r\n sincerity and a complete lack of prejudice. What I have done to aid\r\n him was done without any design of benefiting the State or myself, of\r\n my own free will and reason. He will see that I shall not trouble him\r\n much or reproach him every hour as will probably be done by others. If\r\n I have asked him for anything, as for example San Germano, I can truly\r\n say it was rather offered to me than asked for, and whether I get it\r\n or not, I shall continue the same line of conduct without any feeling\r\n of anger, because I was actuated by higher motives which still affect\r\n me. Messer Gianjacopo would do well to send you the Brief which he\r\n mentioned to Pier Capponi as having already arrived, and which creates\r\n more difficulties; and he would have done still better not to tell\r\n the Pope the intentions of others with regard to the negotiations for\r\n peace. I had given no authority to any one, and am more than content\r\n that love and peace reigns between the King and the Lord Lodovico: for\r\n if a good understanding does not exist between us peril and great loss\r\n will ensue. I never consider that any good will come to me from harm\r\n done to others. Perhaps some day God will open the eyes of all wider.\r\n I am glad your expedition meets with the approval of the person you\r\n mention, I will arrange that you shall find there any news I can give.\r\n But as the Pope appears ill-disposed I have small faith in anything\r\n that depends on him.\r\n\r\n I am very glad that the Count’s affairs at Citerna have been arranged\r\n not only to his satisfaction but in a way honourable to myself. Thank\r\n Virginio [Orsini] heartily from me, to whom we owe this. And as I\r\n understand he has arranged the affairs and interests of all the family\r\n except those of Organtino [Orsini, Clarice’s eldest brother] entreat\r\n him particularly also to arrange Organtino’s satisfactorily, making\r\n him understand that I regard the affairs of His Holiness as being my\r\n own. For the love of God, Baccio, bestir yourself with all your might\r\n in this matter, I am most anxious about it, particularly for love of\r\n Clarice. I long for peace at home as I see small reason to hope for it\r\n abroad.--December 3, 1486.[329]\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Guidone Aldrovandini, _Ambassador from Ferrara to the Florentine\r\nRepublic, to the_ Duke Ercole d’Este\r\n\r\n ... Milan has written the most amiable letters to this Illustrious\r\n Signoria about the affair of Sarzana, saying that they will expose\r\n their State and their persons if necessary in the service of Florence.\r\n These letters are explained by Milan having heard of the league\r\n between the Pope and the Venetians, and finding that she cannot draw\r\n the Pope on her side as she thought, she now tries to make friends\r\n here. The Illustrious Lodovico has also written a most loving letter\r\n to the Magnificent Lorenzo, saying that they have both erred, and\r\n suggesting that the past be set aside and a clean page begun, when\r\n the Magnificent Lorenzo will see that he will be a true and good\r\n brother; and that he will not believe the past has been forgotten\r\n unless some great service is demanded of him. These letters have been\r\n most acceptable to the Magnificent Lorenzo....--Florence, December 10,\r\n 1486.[330]\r\n\r\n ... Sarzana is being bombarded day and night by the Florentine troops,\r\n and it is hoped that S. Francesco will be theirs in two days, when\r\n Sarzana must fall. Some soldiers and officers have fled from the town\r\n and say the inhabitants are in great straits and have begun to eat the\r\n army biscuits, and that Messer Ettore Dal Fiesco, the commissary, is\r\n hated for his extreme cruelty. Two of the mortars of this Illustrious\r\n Signoria have burst. The Magnificent Lorenzo is at Pisa urging on the\r\n capture of Sarzana; he has sent the big mortar from Pisa, and pioneers\r\n in haste to the camp, whom he paid in advance as otherwise none would\r\n go....--Florence, June 7, 1487.[331]\r\n\r\n The Magnificent Lorenzo has gone himself to the camp before Sarzana\r\n to push on matters. S. Francesco has fallen....--Florence, June 9,\r\n 1487.[332]\r\n\r\n The Magnificent Lorenzo arrived here on the vigil of S. Giovanni (23rd\r\n June) and was received with more joy and caresses by the people than I\r\n can describe, as they say they owe the taking of Sarzana to him more\r\n than to others....--Florence, June 26, 1487.\r\n\r\n ... The Magnificent Lorenzo said bitter words to me about the\r\n Illustrious Signor Lodovico (il Moro), particularly as to the\r\n withdrawal of his troops _ex abrupto_ from the camp (before Sarzana),\r\n saying the Signor Lodovico was so puffed up that he fancied the\r\n Genoese would give him Castelletto and Genoa, but that time would\r\n teach him better....--Florence, June 28, 1487.[333]\r\n\r\n ... I again tried to persuade the Magnificent Lorenzo that he would\r\n do well and wisely to let Your Highness try and dissipate this\r\n misunderstanding between the Illustrious Messer Lodovico and His\r\n Magnificence, and that I was sure Your Highness would be able to\r\n arrange matters so that they would be greater friends than before.\r\n His Magnificence was greatly perturbed and said Your Highness was\r\n in a position to know how justified were the complaints of this\r\n Signoria against the Signor Lodovico and then turned his back on me.\r\n I attempted to ask him what this meant but in vain: he would not\r\n answer. I confess I do not know what to infer from this. If Your\r\n Excellency understands, so much the better. A friend told me that at\r\n home His Magnificence talks like a desperate man, and says that he\r\n would like to go for six months to some place where Italian affairs\r\n would never be mentioned, and that your Excellency cannot imagine\r\n what joy His Magnificence showed at the victory gained by the King of\r\n France, and openly said he hoped to see the King master of all Italy.\r\n From this one can only conceive that His Magnificence is very irate.\r\n God turn his heart to act well....--Florence, July 7, 1487.[334]\r\n\r\n ... The Magnificent Lorenzo continues to be desperately angry with the\r\n Illustrious Messer Lodovico.... He spoke most terrible and desperate\r\n words saying that Messer Lodovico was doing all he could to make the\r\n Pope and the Florentines throw themselves at the feet of H.M. the\r\n King, and that this should be done; that as Messer Lodovico wished\r\n Italian affairs to go to the bad His Magnificence would aid and abet\r\n him, &c. What will happen I know not, but I do know that if he were\r\n to act wisely they would come to some good understanding as did his\r\n forefathers, and as Your Highness has told him several times. His\r\n Magnificence sent off special messengers yester eve to Rome and to\r\n Milan. May God guide this business to a good end, for to me it seems\r\n that evil passions are rising here every day....--Florence, July 18,\r\n 1487.[335]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuke Ercole d’Este _to_ Messer Aldrovandini, _Ambassador of Ferrara to\r\nthe Florentine Republic_\r\n\r\n ... You are informed that the Illustrious Messer Lodovico [il Moro]\r\n is ill; it seems he is afflicted with certain pains in the stomach\r\n which give him great suffering. Therefore many friends of his and\r\n of ours at Milan who are anxious about his health, have entreated\r\n us to beg the Magnificent Lorenzo to send a certain Maestro Pietro\r\n Leoni, an excellent doctor who is at Florence, to Milan, a man of\r\n great knowledge who may perhaps cure this malady.[336] We therefore\r\n desire that as soon as you receive this you go to the Magnificent\r\n Lorenzo and in our name beg him as heartily as you can, for love of\r\n us and for the interest we believe he takes in the health of the\r\n Illustrious Lodovico, to send the said Maestro Pietro immediately to\r\n Milan.--Ferrara, August 31, 1487.[337]\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Guidone Aldrovandini, _Ambassador of Ferrara to the Republic of\r\nFlorence, to_ Duke Ercole d’Este\r\n\r\n ... I hear from a good source that Messer Giovanni Jacopo de’ Trivulzi\r\n has been commissioned by the Pope to tell the Magnificent Lorenzo that\r\n he only sleeps with the eyes of the said Magnificent Lorenzo, that he\r\n must advise him, the Pontiff, wisely and guide him; if he does so the\r\n gain and the honour will be his; but if his advice be bad it will lead\r\n to the ruin of both. The Pope complains as high as the third heaven of\r\n the King’s conduct to him.[338] At the same time Messer Jacopo speaks\r\n of the cowardice, misery, and sadness of the Pope, as one speaks about\r\n a blackguard, and says that if he be not encouraged and helped to keep\r\n up his spirits, he will sink lower than any coward ever sank. To-day\r\n comes news that the King has appealed _ad novum Concilium contra\r\n Pontificem_ on account of his behaviour to H.M. This will I believe\r\n frighten the Pope, for he is a very rabbit....--Florence, September 6,\r\n 1487.[339]\r\n\r\n ... The Pope says the King cannot appeal because at Mantua, when\r\n the Diet assembled in the time of Pope Pius, all the Italian princes\r\n promised never to appeal _ad futurem Concilium_. _Item_ that H.M.\r\n expressly promised Pope Sixtus not to appeal, &c. For these reasons\r\n His Sanctity declares that he can proceed against the King. But I\r\n think he will be cautious.--Florence, September 12, 1487.[340]\r\n\r\n ... H.M. the King and the Duke of Calabria[341] declare that neither\r\n through the King of Castile, or through Milan or Florence, have they\r\n ever given a promise to pay tribute to the Pope. Here this declaration\r\n is laughed to scorn as being made by cunning evildoers, _cum sit_ that\r\n Milan and Florence made the promise and the agreement was signed with\r\n the Pope, so H.M. will have to pay the tribute. However like wise men\r\n the Signori of Florence have resolved to ignore the arrogant message\r\n of the King and the Duke, and to drink this bitter cup....--Florence,\r\n November 7, 1487.[342]\r\n\r\n ... To-day at 22 of the clock Messer Ascanio with fourteen horsemen\r\n passed through here in disguise, riding hard by post to Milan. It\r\n appears he has been summoned by the Milanese nobles because the death\r\n of Messer Lodovico is expected. The Magnificent Lorenzo and the\r\n Milanese ambassador saw His Excellency, but no one else as it was kept\r\n secret and he did not enter the city.... Should Messer Lodovico die\r\n the Magnificent Lorenzo will aid Messer Ascanio in every way to become\r\n Lord of Milan. Some time ago he was of a different mind, but now he\r\n will do everything to turn matters in the Pope’s favour and against\r\n H.M. the King.... From a friend I learn that the Duke of Lorraine has\r\n just been here in disguise and has seen the Magnificent Lorenzo at\r\n night, who at once sent him on to the Pope.--Florence, November 18,\r\n 1487.[343]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Innocent VIII.\r\n\r\n _Sanctissime, ac Beattissime Pater post Pedum oscula Beatorum\r\n Vestorum_,--From our ambassador I hear that Your Holiness has seen fit\r\n to suspend the affair of Nantes, and to defer granting the request to\r\n the King of France. Although I must acquiesce in every decision of\r\n Your Holiness, yet the reasons Your Holiness gives for delay cause\r\n me to write again; for if the Most Christian King obtains his desire\r\n he will be even more beholden to Your Sanctity, while my condition\r\n and reputation will be enhanced. I am sure if Your Holiness knew\r\n the help and the utility this would be to me, this business would\r\n not be deferred, particularly as the King has in general no need of\r\n my services, and such an occasion as the present comes but seldom.\r\n If the love Your Holiness bears me is not shown in great matters,\r\n it will be ill seen in small. With all humility therefore I beseech\r\n Your Holiness to deign to grant me one of the greatest boons I could\r\n receive, and to do a pleasure to H.M. the King. A pleasure which\r\n will be much esteemed by H.M., and be most honourable and useful to\r\n me. There will be no difficulty in it, and it cannot be unbecoming\r\n in Your Holiness to satisfy the desire of so great a King, who is so\r\n well-deserving _de Ecclesia Dei_, and at the same time to content me,\r\n Your humble and devoted servant, who humbly commends himself at Your\r\n Holy Feet.--Florence, December 8, 1487. _Humilis servitor_,\r\n\r\n                                            Laurentius de’ Medicis.[344]\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Aldrovandini, _Ambassador from Ferrara to the Florentine\r\nRepublic, to_ Duke Ercole d’Este\r\n\r\n ... The Pope has been much cheered by the assurances of the Venetian\r\n envoys, who openly say that their Signoria only hastened to make\r\n peace with the Germans, in order to come to the aid of His Sanctity\r\n and the honour of the Holy See ... and to force His Majesty the King\r\n to keep the promises made to His Sanctity.... Milan has written here\r\n that she considers the King ought to be informed that should he\r\n fail to arrange matters with the Pope, and the Pope declares war,\r\n he is not to expect help from either Florence or Milan.... As yet\r\n these Signori have not come to any decision, but I think they will\r\n join Milan in this.... As to the Venetians I do not believe they\r\n would bother themselves with such an enterprise, unless they saw a\r\n chance of gaining something in addition to the hatred they bear the\r\n King....--Florence, December 18, 1487.[345]\r\n\r\n ... The Magnificent Lorenzo is of opinion that the Pope should rather\r\n be held back than pushed forward, and that the King should not be\r\n irritated, thus His Magnificence thinks we might have peace and\r\n quiet, if the contrary is done he fears that disaster will ensue....\r\n The Magnificent Lorenzo is extremely discontented with the Pope’s\r\n behaviour, and thinks he shows greater folly every day and every\r\n hour, particularly if he insists in launching interdicts against the\r\n King.... As to the letters written from Milan, which I mentioned\r\n in mine of the 18th, the answer was that as allies they could only\r\n applaud the idea of letting the King know that they desired to stand\r\n well with the Pope, &c. The reply was airy: they did not desire to be\r\n explicit.\r\n\r\n From a friend I learn that the Magnificent Lorenzo spoke in different\r\n terms to the Milanese ambassador, saying, that as Messer Lodovico’s\r\n condition prevents him from attending to business, it seems to him\r\n unwise to irritate the King, particularly as H.M. has everything\r\n ready and is prepared for war, while the Pope is without troops\r\n and with small brains, has bad advisers, and all the Roman Barons\r\n against him. The worst of all being that neither the Pope, nor Milan,\r\n nor Florence, have any commander if they wished to go to war,\r\n &c....--Florence, December 28, 1487.[346]\r\n\r\n ... The Magnificent Lorenzo is of opinion that the acts of the Pope\r\n will be worse than his words. The ambassadors of the League have\r\n arranged with His Sanctity that Imola and Forlì should go to the\r\n Count’s sons,[347] but the Magnificent Lorenzo believes that from\r\n what he hears the children have been poisoned. In this case the\r\n Pope has every claim on that State as being Church property and the\r\n Lords invested by the Church being dead ... His Magnificence would\r\n far rather see Forlì and Imola in private hands than in those of a\r\n powerful prince. But if they are to belong to a potentate he had\r\n rather it should be Milan than the Church; for Milan has several\r\n Baronies, and might bestow the State on some lord, as did Duke\r\n Galeazzo, but the Church would never do so, as for some time she has\r\n been a sworn enemy to the Barons and the Lords, and whatever she\r\n seizes she holds. Also the rule of the Church is so admirable that it\r\n does harm to its neighbours! And although I argued with him to see\r\n whether these were his real convictions he remained staunch, saying\r\n that the time would come when the Church would be more dangerous than\r\n the Signoria of Venice, and that this belief more than anything else\r\n induced him to favour H.M. the King [of Naples]....--Florence, April\r\n 25, 1488.[348]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice Domine mi_,--We arrived safely at Acquapendente yester\r\n evening at 8 o’clock, I wrote to you also from Montepulciano.\r\n To-morrow we leave for Viterbo. We are all in high spirits and find\r\n good cheer, and all along the road we pick up new tunes and May\r\n songs, which seem to me more original here than elsewhere, _alla\r\n Romanesca, vel nota ipsa vel argumento_. I commend myself to Your\r\n Magnificence.--Acquapendente, May 2, 1488. Your Magnificence’s servant,\r\n\r\n                                                   Ang. Politianus.[349]\r\n\r\nPoliziano accompanied Piero de’ Medici to Rome to meet his bride\r\nAlfonsina Orsini, to whom he had been married by proxy at Naples in\r\nFebruary the year before. His mother Clarice, who was very ill, had\r\nbeen in Rome since November hoping, as consumptive people do, that the\r\nmilder air would cure her. With her had gone her favourite daughter,\r\n“the eye of her head,” Maddalena, affianced to the Pope’s illegitimate\r\nson Francesco Cibò. Piero and his wife, Clarice and Maddalena, all\r\nreturned together to Florence, Lorenzo having begged the Pope and Cibò\r\nto allow Maddalena to come with her sick mother. With her, when she\r\nwent to Rome, he had sent Matteo Franco, “one of the dearest creatures\r\nof my house,” he calls him, to keep the young girl company, and to\r\nlook after her. How well the humorous, kindly priest fulfilled his\r\ntrust, how cordially he disliked both Genoese and Romans, and how he\r\nlonged for the brilliant society of the Medici palace is shown in the\r\nfollowing letter. Cibò, a gambler, ignorant and stupid, had sense\r\nenough to recognise how invaluable Franco was, and although he raised\r\nno objection to Maddalena’s going with her mother, he refused to part\r\nwith Franco.\r\n\r\n\r\n Matteo Franco, _from Stigliano, to_ Ser Piero Dovizi da Bibbiena,\r\n _Chancellor to Lorenzo de’ Medici, at Florence_\r\n\r\n O revered, sweet, and good brother mine, where art thou at this\r\n moment? what art thou doing? art thou well? Hast thou so soon\r\n forgotten thy Franco who eating or sleeping only dreams of his dear\r\n soul Ser Piero? This I will never believe, far rather would I imagine\r\n that thou art hurt because I have written so seldom; that thou art\r\n sorry because I am not near thee, thy companions and affairs; and\r\n above all that thou art sorry because thou dost not see the expected\r\n fruit of thy kind and loving sowing, of thy many heartfelt letters\r\n in my favour, of all the kind things said about me to my lord and of\r\n thy expectation founded on the esteem and love thou bearest me. All\r\n this gladdens and yet distresses me; gladdens me because I rejoice in\r\n possessing so good and true a friend; distresses me when I think that\r\n all thy trouble has been in vain by no fault of mine. But, sweet Ser\r\n Piero, do not lose faith in me, as I do not lose it in thee, good will\r\n come of it all.\r\n\r\n Thou must know that till now we have come out of all with honour, _id\r\n est_ thy Franco, as Franco, towards his masters, towards thee, and\r\n towards himself, has done well despite of malignant, venomous and\r\n treacherous, envious, &c. I came, and on the road and whilst in Rome,\r\n with all the love and economy I was able to employ was so useful to\r\n my masters that they showed their appreciation by words and deeds\r\n many times; particularly when I stood aloof and they tried others. Of\r\n the money received by me for the expenses, my enemies twice carefully\r\n dissected, like anatomists, my accounts, shop by shop, day by day,\r\n entry by entry; and everything was in such order that calumny had a\r\n fall, and they were laughed at and put to shame. Thus my affection,\r\n fidelity, and diligence were established and talked of publicly by\r\n them as I heard privately, so that I pardon all. When I made up the\r\n final balance only twenty-eight lire were missing, which must have\r\n been forgotten by the man who buys retail. This would be of small\r\n account if I had not lost so much in brains, soul, and body, instead\r\n of only twenty-eight lire, in all these devilries and persecutions,\r\n &c., so that I even once cursed both thee and Lorenzo who sent me into\r\n this hell. But God has helped us, for of a certain Lorenzo, thou, and\r\n my own good intentions, could not have a bad ending.\r\n\r\n All this, my Ser Piero, must be a comfort to thee as it is to me.\r\n Also I cannot describe the kindness and love shown to me by Madonna\r\n Clarice, twice or thrice she even said that the Count showed small\r\n discretion in taking me from her, exclaiming: “See how I am left, I\r\n will not allow any man to have the spending of my money but Franco;\r\n and I will eat nothing but what has passed through his hands; we never\r\n intended to give Franco to him in order that he might be buried alive\r\n in a wood, he would be far more useful to Madonna Maddalena and to his\r\n house if he were here at hand, &c.” She talked of this a hundred times\r\n and has already sent for me twice since I have been at these baths,\r\n and kept me two or three days until his Lordship drove me back to the\r\n baths.\r\n\r\n It was rumoured that Maddalena was to go to Florence with Alfonsina\r\n and a list was drawn up of things she was going to ask of the Count\r\n for her journey; among others she desired:\r\n\r\n “As chaplain I wish for Franco.\r\n\r\n “And some one to write my letters, for this Franco will be good.\r\n\r\n “And I should like Your Excellency’s necklace for the time I am in\r\n Florence, and such a dress and such footmen, &c., if it please you,\r\n &c.” The list was given to my lord in the evening and after reading\r\n it he replied: “All thou askest I give thee willingly, save only\r\n Franco and my necklace.” The girl replied: “Madonna Clarice desires\r\n that he should come.” “And I desire that he should stay. They have\r\n nought more to do with Franco once Lorenzo has given him to thee, and\r\n I desire that thou leavest him to look after thy interests for the\r\n income of the baths I intend for thee. Thou seest how I am robbed by\r\n all. He has done more in the fifteen days he has been there than all\r\n my other people since I had Cervetri.”\r\n\r\n These words were repeated to me by my angel mistress and lady, who has\r\n doubtless wept more than once with Madonna Baccia over my coming to\r\n stay here, for Madonna Baccia writes that she talks of me and calls\r\n me every hour. Were it not for this and for the thought of him there,\r\n who is my soul and my heart, of whom I think in all my tribulations\r\n so that by the true God, Ser Piero, melancholy then flies from me and\r\n my heart is so consoled that my soul is kept in my body. Otherwise\r\n I should have died a hundred times. Enough. I might go on and tell\r\n that every day I hear how my lord praises me, and I hope from these\r\n baths to get great honour, &c., and a hundred other expectations from\r\n friends and models made in Rome. But as I do not want to break thy\r\n head I skip: enough that I have let off a little bile; I wanted to\r\n tell thee something about my life. I have been here at the baths of\r\n Stigliano since March 12th, saving the few days Madonna Clarice sent\r\n for me as I said; and have already arranged the baths Tuscan fashion.\r\n The rooms are disgusting, Bagno a Morba is a Careggi in comparison;\r\n the air is accursed, the men are like Turks; everything as bad as can\r\n be. Day and night I have to struggle with _bravi_, with soldiers,\r\n with swindlers, with venomous dogs, with lepers, with Jews, with\r\n madmen, with thieves, and with Romans. Now I run to the cook, now\r\n to the baker, then to the tavern, then to clients in the inns; then\r\n I argue with the discontented, with the sick in the hospital, then\r\n with the pedlar, then with the grocer, then with the chemist; then I\r\n go to the washerwoman, then to the grooms, then to the courier, then\r\n to the doctor, then to the priest. For I have transported all these\r\n people here; there were but bare walls and only half of them standing.\r\n In short I have had to bring from the smallest to the largest thing\r\n which may be needful for perhaps ten thousand people into this forest,\r\n so that every man may have, by paying, every convenience he wants. And\r\n I am alone to manage all. During this month of May never a day has\r\n passed but there have been a hundred or a hundred and fifty persons;\r\n rooms, beds, even the courtyard, all are full, and some days there\r\n have been more than three hundred. Most of them stay three days and\r\n then go; and I have to receive them all, to see to their food, to\r\n provide what they want and have not brought with them, grass, oats,\r\n hay, in short, everything. For all this they have to pay me, so I\r\n hope to glean more than four hundred ducats for Madonna Maddalena if\r\n God gives me health. With cooks, innkeepers, bakers and so on, I have\r\n about twenty-five men in my pay; and if you could see your Franco\r\n in this tempest and purgatory and whirl, host of this great inn of\r\n the devil, by God you would pity him. They comfort me by saying that\r\n Christ must wish me well if I escape without a beating, a knife in my\r\n ribs, a quarrel, or an illness, for no one has ever returned whole\r\n from here, God be praised for His mercies. Yet I am of good cheer and\r\n have such faith in my fair dealing that I hope to do myself honour, if\r\n it pleases God. Till now I have pocketed about a hundred ducats, and\r\n all sorts and conditions of men have come. If I have not gained with\r\n the bad ones I have not lost; most went away contented. From those of\r\n the better sort, couriers, gentlemen, and the like, I think I have\r\n gained affection and esteem, for since they returned to Rome they have\r\n written to me and sent me presents. Some day I hope to find a great\r\n joy, I even hope in the ---- of Lucifer the Great, serving for the\r\n love of God, of Lorenzo and of what is his. _Vale._--May 6, 1488.\r\n\r\n                   Your Franco, fighting at the Baths of Stigliano.[350]\r\n\r\nThe rejoicings for Piero’s marriage were suddenly turned to mourning.\r\nLorenzo’s second daughter Luisa, betrothed to her cousin Giovanni, of\r\nthe junior branch of the Medici, died at the age of sixteen, so bride\r\nand bridegroom went to Careggi without entering Florence. Early in\r\nJune, however, a magnificent banquet was given in honour of Alfonsina,\r\nto which all the foreign ambassadors and the chief citizens of the\r\ncity were invited. Soon afterwards arrived Francesco Cibò, and for the\r\nfirst time since the Pazzi conspiracy in 1478 the day of S. Giovanni\r\n(24th June) was again celebrated with great magnificence. The peasants\r\nflocked into Florence to see the Pope’s son, husband of the gentle\r\nMaddalena, and the crowd saluted him with loud cries of “_Cibò e\r\nPalle_.” Serdonati’s account of Lorenzo’s home life, apropos of these\r\nfestivities, is interesting.\r\n\r\n “When in 1488 Francesco went to Florence to celebrate his marriage\r\n he took many knights and noble persons with him, the flower of the\r\n Roman nobility. He was received with great splendour and lodged with\r\n all his people right royally. But soon Lorenzo, taking pleasure in\r\n seeing his son-in-law familiarly, or perchance thinking to gain still\r\n more the Pope’s benevolence, continually invited him to dine at his\r\n house without ceremony, or as we say _alla casalinga_. Now it appears\r\n that the Florentines are generally held to be chary of spending\r\n their money, so he thought that those gentlemen who had accompanied\r\n him to honour his wedding might be treated in like manner, and was\r\n sore troubled, fearing that the city of Florence and his relations\r\n would be held up to ridicule afterwards in Rome. Afraid to hear\r\n what he did not wish, he dared not ask how they fared. But one day\r\n a Roman gentleman who was intimate with him saw how full of thought\r\n he was and asked the reason. He answered that although he knew his\r\n father-in-law Lorenzo was a man of great reputation and worth, yet he\r\n felt mortified, because on account of the usage of the city or for\r\n some other reason his friends were treated in too homely a fashion. He\r\n was therefore pained, but it might be remedied by a speedy departure,\r\n and in Rome he would indemnify them for any discomforts or annoyances\r\n they had undergone. The cavalier, astonished, replied that had the\r\n Pope himself been lodged as they were he could not have complained, or\r\n been more magnificently entertained, cared for, served and honoured,\r\n and that no one could desire more. So delighted was Francesco to\r\n hear this that he could not contain himself and recounted all to his\r\n father-in-law, who with great urbanity replied that children, among\r\n whom he now reckoned Francesco, and strangers and noble persons, such\r\n as had accompanied him, were to be treated differently; the latter\r\n with all magnificence, partly for their own merits, partly out of\r\n respect for him and to do him honour; but that between him and his\r\n own children he had made no difference. This gave much pleasure and\r\n satisfaction to Francesco and greatly pleased the Pope when he heard\r\n of it, and all admired the wisdom and prudence of Lorenzo in all\r\n things both public and private.”[351]\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Aldrovandini, _Ambassador from Ferrara to the Florentine\r\nRepublic, to the_ Duke Ercole d’Este\r\n\r\n I have seen Pier Filippo Pandolfini twice, who is the heart of Lorenzo\r\n in the Council and the first citizen of Florence ... to tell him\r\n according to your Excellency’s instructions that we will do anything\r\n rather than break with Milan. He replied that they would never commit\r\n the error of breaking, but _etiam_ that they would never consent to\r\n anything that would dishonour or disgrace this city. Florence, he\r\n said, is neither Cremona nor Pavia, which are subject to the State of\r\n Milan, and he thought Milan wished to treat the Florentines as though\r\n they were her subjects ... and that now this Signoria [Florence] had\r\n reconquered Piancaldoli[352] they would never give it up.--Florence,\r\n May 15, 1488.[353]\r\n\r\n ... The Illustrious Signori Eight sent for me to-day; with them was\r\n the Magnificent Lorenzo and several citizens, and they told me the\r\n news from Faenza. The imprisonment of Messer Giovanni [Bentivoglio]\r\n and of Madonna, the death of Count Giampiero del Bergamino [Captain\r\n of the Milanese troops], and that the people insisted that the son of\r\n Messer Galeotto should be installed as their Lord under the protection\r\n of Florence. The Eight had already recalled their Commissary who had\r\n been sent to Castrocaro and he had arrived at Faenza. This Illustrious\r\n Signoria has decided to accept the guardianship and protection of the\r\n State of Faenza for the ward, son of Messer Galeotto, and has thus\r\n written, and has ordered troops to march towards Faenza, &c.[354]\r\n I fear, Illustrious Lord, that this year is the beginning of the\r\n thirteen disastrous months. All the condottieri who had been dismissed\r\n by this Illustrious Signoria they now show a desire to re-engage,\r\n indeed they have already begun to do so. My own feeling is that never\r\n was a greater need of attempting a reconciliation between the State of\r\n Milan and this Illustrious Signoria, and Your Excellency must strip to\r\n your shirt and use all your wisdom. It is a fact that Messer Galeotto\r\n was a soldier and a _raccomandato_ (under the protection) of this\r\n Signoria, and to them belongs the guardianship of the State and the\r\n boy more than to others, particularly as the people themselves demand\r\n it.--Florence, June 5, 1488.[355]\r\n\r\n ... Yesterday I was with the Magnificent Lorenzo in S. Liberata [the\r\n cathedral] for full two hours talking about setting the Magnificent\r\n Messer Giovanni at liberty. His Magnificence replied that Your\r\n Excellency could write to and treat with this Signoria as you\r\n pleased, and also with His Magnificence, but that he had warned\r\n Madonna Ginevra [wife of Giovanni Bentivoglio] to abstain from begging\r\n others to intercede for his liberation; hinting broadly to me that\r\n Messer Lodovico [Sforza] should not be asked to interfere ... that\r\n until matters were arranged at Faenza Messer Giovanni must take\r\n patience, as this Signoria would support the people of Faenza until\r\n everything was in order.[356]\r\n\r\n This morning the Illustrious Eight sent for me to announce that the\r\n citadel of Faenza had been given up by the governor and _etiam_ the\r\n departure of Madonna Francesca.--Florence, June 9, 1488.[357]\r\n\r\n ... After the Magnificent Lorenzo had seen Messer Giovanni\r\n [Bentivoglio], who had been set at liberty and was in Florence, I went\r\n to hear what had passed between them. His Magnificence told me there\r\n had been much talk and that all the linen had been washed clean. It\r\n seemed to him that Messer Giovanni was quite satisfied and bore no\r\n rancour against this city or against himself, and had promised to\r\n represent matters to Milan so that nothing more would be said about\r\n Faenza.... At daylight the Magnificent Lorenzo left to take the baths\r\n at Villa (Filetta). His wife is very ill,[358] and there is no hope of\r\n her recovery.--Florence, July 21, 1488....[359]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Pope Innocent VIII.\r\n\r\n _Sanctissime ac Beatissime Pater post Pedum oscula Beatorum\r\n Vestrorum_,--Too often am I obliged to trouble and worry Your\r\n Beatitude with accidents sent by fortune and divine interposition,\r\n which as they are not to be resisted must be borne with patience.\r\n But the death of Clarice, which has just occurred, my most dear and\r\n beloved wife, has been and is so prejudicial, so great a loss, and\r\n such a grief to me for many reasons, that it has exhausted my patience\r\n and my power of enduring anguish, and the persecution of fortune,\r\n which I did not think would have made me suffer thus. The deprivation\r\n of such habitual and such sweet company has filled my cup and has made\r\n me so miserable that I can find no peace. Nought is left but to pray\r\n God that He may give me peace, and I have faith that in His infinite\r\n love He will alleviate my sorrow and not overwhelm me with so many\r\n disasters as I have endured during these last years. I humbly beg Your\r\n Beatitude with all my heart to pray for me as I know how efficacious\r\n are such prayers. I commend myself and place myself at Your Holy\r\n Feet.--Filetta, July 31, 1488. Your devoted servant,\r\n\r\n                                             Laurentius de Medicis.[360]\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Aldrovandini, _Ambassador to the Republic of Florence, to the_\r\nDuke Ercole d’Este\r\n\r\n ... I wrote that Madonna Clarice was ill, she died three days ago,\r\n but I did not send the news at once as it did not seem to me of much\r\n importance. Now that I am despatching the courier with letters from\r\n Naples I inform Your Excellency. She died last Wednesday at 24 of\r\n the clock and was buried without pomp that evening. The Magnificent\r\n Lorenzo is at Filetta taking the waters and the baths and the doctors\r\n advise him strongly not to come to Florence, also his friends have\r\n written to persuade him to remain and finish his cure, and this he\r\n will do. To-day, according to the custom here, the funeral service\r\n will take place at 21 of the clock. The whole city and the ambassadors\r\n of H.M., of Milan, and myself, have been invited. But before I\r\n received the invitation I went with the Milanese ambassador to the\r\n house of the Magnificent Lorenzo, and we condoled with Piero, the\r\n Magnificent’s eldest son, in the names of our Lords in such words as\r\n seemed fitted to the occasion.--Florence, August 1, 1488.[361]\r\n\r\n Lorenzo’s grief for the loss of Clarice, to whom he was sincerely\r\n but not passionately attached, was mitigated by the information that\r\n his heart’s desire--the nomination of his second son Giovanni, a boy\r\n of fourteen, to the cardinalate--would not be long delayed. The lad\r\n was already abbot of Font Doulce, in the gift of the King of France,\r\n of Passignano in Tuscany bestowed on him by the Pope, of Miramondo\r\n given by Lodovico il Moro, and of the great abbey of Monte Cassino _in\r\n commendam_ given to him by Ferrante, King of Naples. Innocent VIII.\r\n had declared he would make no cardinals under the age of thirty, but\r\n in March 1489 he yielded to Lorenzo’s entreaties, on the understanding\r\n that the nomination was to be kept secret for three years, and was\r\n exceedingly irate when it was divulged.\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Aldrovandini, _Ambassador of Ferrara to the Republic of\r\nFlorence, to_ Duke Ercole d’Este\r\n\r\n ... Some Corsicans on the pretence of buying wheat from the Castellan\r\n of Monte-acute, a castle in the Maremma belonging to Siena, entered\r\n in, slew the Castellan and seized the castle. The Sienese have sent a\r\n Commissary with troops, and have applied for help to the Signoria of\r\n Florence, who have ordered the Count of Pitigliano, their captain, to\r\n send his men to the aid of the Sienese--January 10, 1489.[362]\r\n\r\n ... A courier has just arrived from the Count of Pitigliano to the\r\n Magnificent Lorenzo stating that his son has bought the castle of\r\n Monte-acuto from the Corsicans who had taken it, and he begs that his\r\n son, not being a soldier in the pay of this Illustrious Signoria,\r\n may be allowed to keep it, because together with many others in that\r\n district it once was the property of his ancestors. Also that when his\r\n own engagement ceases at the end of February he intends to recuperate\r\n the others which are held by Siena. I wished to know how things\r\n really stood from the Magnificent Lorenzo, and he assured me that the\r\n engagement of the Count of Pitigliano would be prolonged and that he\r\n will give up the castle. And this I believe....--Florence, January 21,\r\n 1489.[363]\r\n\r\n\r\nStefano, _a trusted servant of Piero de’ Medici_, _to_ Lorenzo de’\r\nMedici\r\n\r\n Magnificent Lorenzo,--In my letter of yesterday evening I described\r\n the entry of Madonna the Duchess.[364] Now I tell you of the marriage.\r\n This morning we attended the marriage mass in the cathedral, a most\r\n beautiful and splendid ceremony as Your Magnificence will understand\r\n after reading this. First all the Court and the guests assembled at\r\n the castle. At 15 of the clock the Duke, my Lord Lodovico, the Barons\r\n and other gentlemen, went to fetch Madonna the Duchess, and they all\r\n mounted and left the castle in pairs. At the door was a canopy of\r\n white damask emblazoned with the Duke’s arms, borne by forty doctors\r\n all dressed in crimson satin with certain fur round their necks, and\r\n their caps were also garnished with the same fur. Their Excellencies\r\n the Duke and Madonna rode side by side to the Duomo under the canopy.\r\n The mass was sung by the Duke’s choristers and celebrated by the\r\n Bishop of Piacenza, and at the close the Bishop of Sanseverino gave\r\n an appropriate address. Then the Duke gave the ring to the Duchess.\r\n When all was finished the Illustrious Lord Duke knighted our Piero\r\n Allamanni[365] and the Magnificent Bartolomeo Calcho, and bestowed on\r\n Piero a robe of golden brocade as rich and beautiful as can be. Truly\r\n a most honourable act. Messer Galeazzo and the Count di Cajaza buckled\r\n on the spurs and the swords. Then the whole company mounted and\r\n returned to the castle with great rejoicing and pomp. It is calculated\r\n there were about five hundred horses. Thirty-five divers Orders of\r\n friars and priests preceded the procession to the Duomo; sixty knights\r\n clothed in gold brocade with their collars; fifty women, twenty-eight\r\n were dressed in gold brocade with pearls, jewels, and fine necklaces;\r\n sixty-two trumpeters, and twelve fifers. The distance from the castle\r\n to the Duomo is 1200 paces and it was all covered in with white cloth,\r\n and the walls on either side were hung with tapestry and festoons\r\n of juniper and orange. Nothing finer was ever seen. All the doors\r\n and windows were crowded with women and girls splendidly dressed,\r\n and to avoid any crush or tumult all the streets leading into this\r\n principal one were barred, while at every corner stood ten or twelve\r\n guards. In the cathedral square were stationed two hundred Stradiots\r\n (Greek troops) and crossbow-men on horseback. Everything was so well\r\n managed that there was not the slightest disorder, a marvellous thing\r\n considering the innumerable multitude of people in this city. It is\r\n true that there was great rigour about bearing arms; no one, save our\r\n own people who always went armed, were allowed to carry weapons.\r\n\r\n His Excellency the Duke had a vest of raised gold brocade, richer and\r\n finer than can be described, in his cap was a diamond ornament with\r\n a pearl bigger than a hazelnut, quite round, of great value. On his\r\n breast was a pendant with a ruby and a diamond above it, truly a most\r\n admirable thing.\r\n\r\n Her Excellency the Duchess also wore brocade, and on her head was a\r\n garland of pearls with very fine jewels. There were many other women\r\n most richly dressed, but I do not write their names because I do not\r\n know them.\r\n\r\n Messer Annibale had a robe of golden brocade with stripes of black\r\n velvet and where it opened on his breast was an eagle in pearls which\r\n made a good show, though it was not costly, but rather what one would\r\n call pretty.\r\n\r\n The Lords Lodovico and Galeotto, the Lord Ridolfo and the rest of the\r\n Sforza family were dressed in brocade, and it is calculated that there\r\n were some three hundred thus clothed in silver and gold. Of velvet and\r\n satin I do not speak because even the cooks wore them.\r\n\r\n The robe of our Piero with the bough embroidered on it[366] was much\r\n admired and according to my thinking eclipsed all the others. To-day\r\n their Excellencies sent for him, being desirous to see and examine it,\r\n and indeed every one was loud in their praise. I know I have written\r\n confusedly and without any order: by word of mouth if it pleases God,\r\n we will enter into detail with more leisure than I now have, as I must\r\n ride with Piero to Court. I have no more to say save that I commend\r\n myself to Your Magnificence.--Milan, February 2, 1488 (1489).[367]\r\n\r\n\r\nPetrus Bonus Avogarius, _artium et medicinæ doctor, to_ Lorenzo de’\r\nMedici\r\n\r\n _Magnifice ac poteus domine domine mi singularissime salutem\r\n perpetuam_, &c.,--I have received the letter Your Magnificence sent\r\n me through the Magnificent Aldovrandini, ambassador of the Duke of\r\n Ferrara, and have understood what Your Magnificence writes about the\r\n remedy you desire, for _in doloribus juncturarum_, entering into\r\n details, and when and how, &c. To begin with, _ante omnium_ Your\r\n Magnificence must be purged before the beginning of spring--that is,\r\n before the middle of March. Then if pains are felt the part is to be\r\n rubbed with the ointment made according to the recipe I have given\r\n to Messer Aldovrandini, which he will send to Your Magnificence. The\r\n pains will then cease, but should they return, and even if they do not\r\n return, some medicine must be taken to carry off the offending matter.\r\n My medicine is a conserve made up in solid form called _ellescof_,\r\n half an ounce is to be taken at sunrise once a month, particularly\r\n when Your Magnificence feels any pain. In order to prevent the return\r\n of these pains you must get a stone called sapphire, and have it\r\n set in gold, so that it should touch the skin. This must be worn on\r\n the third finger of the left hand. If this is done the pains in the\r\n joints, or gouty pains, will cease, because that stone has occult\r\n virtues, and the specific one of preventing evil humours going to the\r\n joints: _ego autem hoc expertus sum in me. Est enim divina res et\r\n miraculosa._ Afterwards in the summer, in the month of August, I will\r\n find celandine, which is a red stone that grows in the stomach of the\r\n swallow. I will send it to Your Magnificence to be tied in a piece of\r\n linen and sewn in your shirt under the left breast at the nipple. This\r\n will have the same effect as the sapphire afore-mentioned, and thus\r\n _Deo Duce_ Your Magnificence will be freed of and secure from every\r\n pain in the joints. Messer Aldovrandini will see Your Magnificence,\r\n and tell you fully about it. In order that Your Magnificence should be\r\n acquainted with the future I send you herein enclosed my forecast for\r\n the year 1488, and commend myself a thousand times to Your Excellency\r\n whom may God keep in perfect health.--Ferrara, February 11, 1488\r\n (1489).[368]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Piero Alamanni, _Florentine Ambassador at Rome_\r\n\r\n Thanks be to God for the good news which I received yester morning at\r\n nine from our Messer Giovanni [Tornabuoni]. It seems to me all the\r\n greater because I expected less, and it is so far more than I deserve,\r\n and so difficult of attainment, that it appeared almost impossible. I\r\n have, indeed, reason ever gratefully to remember him who has worked so\r\n hard, and I shall leave my gratitude recorded for those who come after\r\n me, as this is the greatest honour that has ever befallen our house.\r\n Let it suffice to you that I know this; most assuredly more than\r\n three-fourths are due to your diligence, industry, and affection. But\r\n we will speak of this another time. To the Holy Father I have written\r\n a letter which is enclosed. I also write to Bala [Cardinal La Balue]\r\n and Ascanio [Cardinal Sforza], the only ones from whom as yet I have\r\n had letters. From you I expect full details about various things which\r\n are mentioned below. I know not if our Holy Father was displeased at\r\n the demonstrations of joy which were universal here. Never have I seen\r\n more true and general rejoicing. Much more would have been done, only\r\n I forbade it, but this I could not prevent. I say this, because Messer\r\n Giovanni’s promotion being secret these demonstrations seemed contrary\r\n to the intention, but it was a thing of such public notoriety in Rome\r\n that people here can hardly be blamed for following the example set\r\n there, and I could not refuse to accept the congratulations of all\r\n these citizens, down to the very poorest. If it was unseemly it was\r\n impossible to prevent, and I should be glad if you can explain this.\r\n Also I much wish to know how to order Messer Giovanni’s future life;\r\n how he is to dress, and what household he is to have, for I do not\r\n desire to repay so great a boon by doing anything against the wishes\r\n of our Holy Father. Meanwhile Messer Giovanni is in our house,\r\n which has been full of people since yesterday. Let me know therefore\r\n what I am to do. Also if he has occasion to write how is he to sign,\r\n and what seal is he to use? About the Bull I know you will take all\r\n precautions, and send it to me for the satisfaction of our friends.\r\n I send you herein his height, but he seems to me to have grown since\r\n yesterday, and to have changed. I trust to God that he will do honour\r\n to all your labour, and that our Holy Father will every day be better\r\n pleased with him. I wait to know whether I am to send Piero as I\r\n wrote, for to me it seems this great gift demands that I should come\r\n in person. I shall follow your advice in everything.--[March 14,\r\n 1489].[369]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Innocent VIII.\r\n\r\n With the greatest reverence I have received a Brief from Your Sanctity\r\n of the 9th, in which you deign to acquaint me of the promotion of\r\n Messer Giovanni (to the Cardinalate). Having already heard of it\r\n through our ambassador I wrote at once with my own hand to Your\r\n Holiness, rather to confess my inability to give adequate thanks than\r\n to demonstrate my gratitude; our Lord God can do that better than I.\r\n For a long time Your Sanctity has had the disposal of myself and of\r\n all I possess, so I can only add this great gift to the other benefits\r\n bestowed on Messer Giovanni, whom I give to Your Holiness as a thing\r\n belonging to Your Holiness. Whatever I have or shall have will always\r\n be more Your Holiness’ than mine. As to keeping this affair secret I\r\n should be much distressed if the knowledge of it had been made public\r\n by me. But Your Holiness may rest assured that it was immediately\r\n known in Rome, and then divulged by letters to people here, so that\r\n every one came to congratulate me. I can affirm that the news was\r\n not published by me, nor did I cause any demonstration of joy to\r\n be made. In any case, whether by my fault or not, I am extremely\r\n distressed that Your Holiness should have experienced any annoyance,\r\n and can only promise in the future to carry out to the letter any\r\n commands Your Holiness deigns to give me. I entreat Your Holiness to\r\n make Your wishes known to me, of which I shall be the faithful and\r\n diligent executor, not only in this, but in all things, for no one is\r\n more bound to obey Your Holiness. I commend myself humbly at the Holy\r\n Feet of Your Beatitude.--Florence, March 14, 1488 (1489). _Humilis\r\n Servitor_,\r\n\r\n                                             Laurentius de Medicis.[370]\r\n\r\n\r\nManfredo di Manfredi (_a new Ferrarese Ambassador_) _to_ Duke Ercole\r\nd’Este\r\n\r\n ... This evening about one of the night, the Magnificent Lorenzo and\r\n the Illustrious Eight sent to tell me the good news that that blessed\r\n Monte-acuto has been given up....--Florence, April 8, 1489.[371]\r\n\r\n ... The Count of Pitigliano will be dismissed because this Signoria\r\n and the Magnificent Lorenzo are very irate at the obstinacy he has\r\n shown about giving up Monte-acuto.... It seems that Jacopo Conti will\r\n be named in his stead.... The Magnificent Lorenzo is a man who does\r\n not waste many words, and tells his intentions to no one until he is\r\n sure of obtaining what he wants. He never says four until he has it\r\n safe in a sack....--Florence, April 25, 1489.[372]\r\n\r\n Yesterday two men taken at Firenzuola were brought here, one named\r\n Raimo da Gaeta, the other Vincenzo Ragonora; the report is that they\r\n were going to the baths where the Magnificent Lorenzo now is, in\r\n order to poison or murder him. It is said they were sent by H.M. the\r\n King of Naples or by the Duke of Calabria, although it is affirmed\r\n that they have been some time at Bologna. Some hold the report to be\r\n unfounded and that these men came for another purpose. Nevertheless\r\n they have been subjected to such a stringent examination that it has\r\n raised suspicions among the ambassadors. They were examined by the\r\n principal citizens, relations, and intimate friends of the Magnificent\r\n Lorenzo.... This evening I hear that a horseman arrived from Messer\r\n Giovanni Bentivoglio, and I have found out that he was sent to the\r\n King’s ambassador by the said Messer Giovanni, who anxiously begs H.M.\r\n to take steps for the release of these prisoners; the King has written\r\n to say that about six months ago they were sent to him by the Duke of\r\n Calabria with a request that they might be engaged in his army, and he\r\n bids the ambassador to see that they are set free, being soldiers of\r\n the Duke of Calabria and in his pay.--Florence, May 18, 1489.[373]\r\n\r\n ... Why these men were imprisoned and the results of their examination\r\n have been kept so secret that no one can find out anything. But\r\n Raimo da Gaeta has, they say, been tortured, so is in anguish and\r\n despair....--Florence, May 29, 1489.[374]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Pope Innocent VIII.\r\n\r\n My ambassador has written to tell me that at last by the kindness of\r\n Your Holiness the contract of the alum works has been awarded to me,\r\n for this I owe infinite thanks to Your Holiness who has thus added\r\n another to the many obligations I already owe, and hope to enjoy in\r\n the future from the liberality and kindness of Your Beatitude. I am\r\n exceedingly grateful for and pleased by the paternal charity shown\r\n to me every day by Your Holiness, and should be yet more happy did I\r\n not hear that Your Holiness has been suffering from gout and slight\r\n fever. Although the attack is not a severe one, still, depending\r\n as I do on Your Holiness, and Your Holiness’ life being of such\r\n importance, I cannot but feel uneasy even at a small indisposition,\r\n particularly as these attacks come oftener than one could wish. Your\r\n Holiness can rest assured that even as S. Francis by reason of his\r\n stigmate felt the pain of the wounds of Jesus Christ, thus do I feel\r\n every pain and ill suffered by Your Holiness in my own person and am\r\n much molested thereby. Among other things the condition of our Ser\r\n Francesco[375] touches me deeply, as well as that of other dependants\r\n of Your Holiness, who by reason of the uprightness and honesty of Your\r\n Beatitude may be said to be still fasting and to have had but a small\r\n share of the great good fortune which our Lord God has so worthily\r\n bestowed on Your Holiness. Should anything happen to Your Holiness,\r\n _quod absit_, the sepulchre will open also for them. Although I feel\r\n compassion for them all I am more moved by what ought to touch Your\r\n Holiness more nearly than myself, and that is the sad condition of\r\n poor Ser Francesco, who in the five years of the pontificate of Your\r\n Holiness has never yet had anything he can call his own. Your Holiness\r\n is the best judge of what support he enjoys in the Sacred College and\r\n what office, dignity or means, he has to enable him to live, even\r\n poorly. If Your Holiness studies the lives of other Popes you will see\r\n that there are but few who during five years of pontifical rule, and\r\n some in even less time, have not manifested their intention of acting\r\n as a Pope, and have not shown the respect for honesty and uprightness\r\n displayed by Your Holiness, which is justified before God and man.\r\n But speaking as a devoted servant, this honesty might now be imputed\r\n and attributed to another motive. Maybe I appear presumptuous, but\r\n zeal and the duty I owe to Your Holiness so touch my conscience that\r\n I must speak thus openly and remind Your Holiness that all men are\r\n mortal, and that a Pope is what he wills to be; he cannot leave the\r\n Papacy as a heritage and can only call his own the honours, the glory\r\n and the benefits, he gives to his family. The prudence, experience\r\n and long acquaintance Your Sanctity has of a court, will I am sure\r\n without words from me, recall to Your Holiness what always happens to\r\n the fortune and inheritance of popes, and seeing that Ser Francesco\r\n and the others of Your Holiness’ family are as yet not to be envied\r\n but rather merit compassion, Your Sanctity ought to follow the example\r\n of Your Holiness’ predecessors and place them in such a position\r\n that they should have no need of others, particularly as whatever is\r\n bestowed on them does not diminish the substance of Your Holiness and\r\n is not lost or thrown away. Briefly, with all humility, I entreat\r\n Your Sanctity at last to begin and act as a Pope with regard to the\r\n family of Your Holiness and not to trust so much in posterity and good\r\n health, which can only retard the fulfilment of what Your Holiness\r\n intends to do for them. Delay might perhaps prevent this being\r\n accomplished. Especially do I recommend Your and my Ser Francesco and\r\n the Lady Maddalena, who pray that God may grant Your Holiness a long\r\n life in order that their affairs may be properly adjusted, and when\r\n better arranged they will give thanks to God and to Your Holiness,\r\n and have reason to remember and to bless the day when Your Sanctity\r\n was called to the honours and dignity of the pontificate. It is time,\r\n Holy Father, to liberate these Holy Fathers from limbo, so that it\r\n may not happen to them as to the Jews who awaited the Messiah. I beg\r\n Your Holiness’ pardon with all humility and reverence for this my\r\n presumption only caused by reasons which I am sure Your Holiness will\r\n appreciate, and I place myself humbly at Your most holy feet.--1489.\r\n _Humilis Servitor_,\r\n\r\n                                             Laurentius de Medicis.[376]\r\n\r\n\r\nA Manager of the Medici Bank _to the_ Duke Ercole d’Este\r\n\r\n To the Illustrious Duke Ercole, &c.\r\n\r\n According to the usual custom and rule we advise you that to-day the\r\n Magnificent Lorenzo has lent Pope Innocent 100,000 ducats for a year;\r\n one-third in cash, one-third in silk goods, and one-third in woollen\r\n cloth. As surety he has two-tenths on the stipends of all newly\r\n appointed priests, 70,000 ducats, and for the rest he will hold Città\r\n di Castello until entirely repaid.\r\n\r\n I give you another piece of news: Pope Innocent has given the\r\n Magnificent Lorenzo 30,000 cántara of alum at 1 ducat the cántaro\r\n as payment of what was owing to him by Pope Sixtus, the 40,000 he\r\n received for the war, which is good news.--Florence, 1489. Your\r\n servant and particular partisan,\r\n\r\n                                        B. Des. of the Medici Bank.[377]\r\n\r\nIt appears that Lorenzo’s share in the bank was one-half, the other\r\nhalf belonged to various partners. The Duke of Ferrara wrote on the\r\n20th December 1489 to Giuliano Gondi announcing that he had arranged\r\na marriage for his daughter Isabella with the Marquess of Mantua on\r\nthe 16th February 1490, and begged for a spinel ruby which was in pawn\r\nfor 4000 ducats with the Magnificent Lorenzo & Co. in order to wear it\r\nduring the festivities. He also wrote to Lorenzo asking that the ruby\r\nmight be sent, saying that he could not pay the money at that moment.\r\nBut Lorenzo answered that he could only promise for the half as the\r\nother belonged to various merchants. So the Duke again wrote to Gondi\r\nand asked him to go surety for him for 2000 ducats repayable in April\r\n1492, guaranteed on the salt mines of Modena, &c. Lorenzo was also a\r\npartner in the bank at Lyons with Francesco Sassetti and others, of\r\nwhich the manager was Leonetto de’ Rossi, husband of Maria de’ Medici,\r\nLorenzo’s sister. Machiavelli’s statement that Lorenzo had nothing to\r\ndo with the bank is contradicted by the above letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Giovanni Lanfredini, _Florentine Ambassador at\r\nRome_\r\n\r\n The Count della Mirandola is here leading a most saintly life, like a\r\n monk. He has been and is now occupied in writing admirable theological\r\n works: commentaries and Psalms; and other excellent books on theology.\r\n He recites the ordinary priest’s office, observes all fasts and\r\n absolute chastity: has but a small retinue and lives quite simply\r\n with only what is necessary. To me he appears an example to other\r\n men. He is anxious to be absolved from what little contumacy is still\r\n attributed to him by the Holy Father and to have a Brief by which His\r\n Holiness accepts him as a son and a good Christian, he persevering\r\n in a Christian life. I greatly desire that this satisfaction should\r\n be given to him, for there are few men I love better or esteem more.\r\n I feel certain that he is a devout and faithful Christian, and his\r\n conduct is such that the whole city would vouch for him. Do all you\r\n can to obtain this Brief in such a form that it may content his\r\n conscience. This would be not less agreeable to me than any one\r\n of the many services you have rendered, and for which I am most\r\n grateful.--June 19, 1489.[378]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici, _from the Baths of Spedaletto_, _to his daughter_\r\nContessina\r\n\r\n My dear little Contessina,--As I hear that every hour thou askest\r\n after me, how I am, and when I am coming back, I write to tell thee\r\n that thanks be to God I am very well, and have improved ever since\r\n my departure. These continued baths suit me excellently. So that I\r\n hope, if it pleases God, to return as full of health as ever I was.\r\n I shall leave very soon and come back to see thee. Let me find\r\n thee well and happy and meanwhile pray to God for me. Be very nice\r\n to Alfonsina [Orsini, wife of Piero, Lorenzo’s eldest son] and keep\r\n her company; tell her from me to take great care of the baby. I hear\r\n that Monsignore [Giovanni] and the other children have gone away,\r\n they have done ill to leave thee thus alone, but I shall be back\r\n soon and stay with thee, and they can remain at the villa at their\r\n pleasure.--Spedaletto on the last day of July, 1489.\r\n\r\n Greet thy Piero and Niccolò and all the others from me when thou seest\r\n them.[379]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Giovanni Lanfredini, _Florentine Ambassador at\r\nRome_\r\n\r\n To my great vexation I hear how this work of Mirandola’s is abused,\r\n and were I not sure that such persecution is dictated solely by envy\r\n and malignity, by my faith, I should not mention it. The book has\r\n been examined by all the most learned priests here, well-known men of\r\n saintly life, and has been highly approved of by them as a Christian\r\n and a marvellous work. I am not so bad a Christian as to remain silent\r\n or to encourage him if I thought otherwise. I am certain that if he\r\n recited the _Credo_ those spiteful men would say it was rank heresy.\r\n If His Holiness had the intelligence to understand this and was not\r\n too busy, I am sure these accusations would fall to the ground and\r\n truth would prevail; but he is obliged to trust to others. This poor\r\n man is unable to defend himself because they say his premises are\r\n against His Holiness. If he had to contend with them only without the\r\n authority of the Pope to back them I am sure he would soon silence\r\n them. It is his misfortune to have to submit to the judgment of\r\n ignorant and malicious men who use the Pope as a shield. I have\r\n already told you that I believe all this is done with the intent to\r\n drive him to despair and cause him to lose his head so that eventually\r\n he should turn against the Pope; for believe me, Giovanni, he is\r\n one who could commit either great evil or great good. His life and\r\n character demonstrate this. If they drive him into another path I\r\n shall lose little, as I know that wherever he may be he will always\r\n bear me goodwill because of my great affection for him. I have never\r\n been able to make you understand this; and without entering into\r\n details, which I cannot do, I must tell you he has been sorely tempted\r\n by something which might raise a great scandal, and I have always\r\n stopped him. Latterly he has been leading a saintly life here, and his\r\n mind is at rest. These devils with their persecutions will tempt him.\r\n People place far too much faith in them. In short I can only grieve\r\n over all this and beg you again to use all your cleverness in order to\r\n arrange matters, for you have no idea how it vexes and irritates me.\r\n If you knew how much, you would never rest until you have taken it off\r\n my mind.--October 1489.[380]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Monseigneur d’Argenton (Philippe de Comines)\r\n\r\n My illustrious Lord,--I have received a letter from Your Seigneury\r\n by the same hand that takes this, and am extremely concerned at\r\n the displeasure you express about the last account sent in by\r\n Cosimo Saxetti [Sassetti, head of the Medici bank at Lyons] to Your\r\n Seigneury. It would afflict me still more if I thought that this\r\n might cause you to doubt my gratitude towards Your Seigneury, to\r\n whom I am so much beholden in infinite ways, that I should indeed\r\n deserve to be called a most ungrateful man if I did not repay you\r\n the money I owe for the many benefits received from Your Seigneury\r\n in adversity and in prosperity. But after a strict examination of\r\n my conscience I can assure Your Seigneury that neither I nor any of\r\n my house will ever forget this. If therefore anything Cosimo Saxetti\r\n has said about Your Seigneury’s participation has given such an\r\n impression I should be deeply grieved, as it would be the reverse\r\n of the truth and of my intentions. I confess that for some time, as\r\n Your Seigneury well knows, the losses of our bank at Lyons have been\r\n so considerable that it has been impossible to conceal them, or to\r\n avoid lamenting over them with those who, like Your Seigneury, have\r\n been and are masters of what is mine. The aforesaid Cosimo has thus\r\n perhaps annoyed Your Seigneury, but you may be certain that I would\r\n never raise any question as to a statement of yours, either what you\r\n now write or at any future time. Your Seigneury can freely dispose not\r\n only of the entire sum which you mention as being a matter of dispute\r\n between Your Seigneury and Cosimo, but of everything I possess as\r\n though it belonged to you. You may therefore rest assured that all\r\n will be arranged between Your Seigneury and myself so satisfactorily\r\n that no question will ever arise, for I set greater store on the good\r\n graces of Your Seigneury than on the largest sum of money in the\r\n world.--December 11, 1489.[381]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                                               _Alinari_\r\n\r\nLORENZO DI PIERO DE’ MEDICI, AND THREE MEMBERS OF THE SASSETI FAMILY.\r\n_In the fresco by Domenico Ghirlandaio in the Church of S. Trinità,\r\nFlorence._]\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Vettori, Florentine ambassador at Naples, and\r\nthe one from Lorenzo to Lanfredini at Rome (p. 319) show what prudence\r\nand patience the Magnificent exercised in mediating between the Pope\r\nand the King of Naples. Ferrante broke every obligation of his treaty\r\nwith Innocent. He exterminated the rebel Barons with ferocity, he\r\nmurdered the Papal governor and garrison of Aquila, he bestowed the\r\nNeapolitan benefices on unworthy men without heeding the remonstrances\r\nof the Pope, he repudiated the tribute due to the Holy See. Innocent\r\nwas very angry. He declared the Kingdom to be forfeited for non-payment\r\nof the tribute, he threatened an interdict and, what particularly\r\nalarmed and displeased Lorenzo, talked about foreign intervention.\r\nAgainst both Lorenzo warned him, at the same time supporting him in\r\nresisting humiliating terms. Had Lodovico Sforza been trustworthy\r\nLorenzo’s task might have been easier, but he significantly remarks,\r\n“I have expressed my opinion of the Lord Lodovico and have said what\r\nI think of him.” At length, shortly before Lorenzo’s death, peace was\r\nconcluded, Ferrante consenting to pay the tribute on condition of the\r\ninvestiture of his son and grandson.\r\n\r\n\r\nPietro Vettori, _Florentine Ambassador at Naples, to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n Magnificent Lorenzo,--Since I wrote on the 2nd I have received yours\r\n of February 29th, which arrived most opportunely as here they were\r\n anxious, and suspected you had some secret understanding with the\r\n Pope. As the King was not here I thought it better to communicate\r\n your letter to H.E. the Duke [Alfonso of Calabria]. So yesterday I\r\n went to Castel Nuovo and took Baccio with me, who had been summoned\r\n here by the Duke. When he had read the letter I added that though you\r\n knew the King and H.E. were convinced of the loyalty of ourselves and\r\n of our city, yet it seemed to me that as these suspicions had arisen\r\n you wished to set matters right, and that you were the same Lorenzo\r\n you had ever been. H.E. answered he had no doubt of this. That he had\r\n summoned Baccio in order to send him to you at Florence to inform\r\n you of his feelings, as he liked to speak openly and desired others\r\n to do so to him. That it was perfectly known all over Italy what\r\n influence you had with the Pope and that the Florentine ambassador\r\n _quodammodo_ governed at Rome. On the other hand the Pope showed great\r\n animosity towards the Neapolitan State and had only summoned those\r\n Spanish ambassadors in order to protest against H.M. the King and\r\n then to publish the excommunications which were already ready. H.E.\r\n is informed that last year and also two years ago everything was\r\n being secretly prepared for this last blow. He appears to have some\r\n other source of information than the usual ones. He added that his\r\n chief occupation now was contradicting those who by word of mouth or\r\n by letters from Rome told him that you are in league with the Pope,\r\n and allow these things to happen, and that although neither he nor\r\n the King believe this all Italy is convinced of it, to their great\r\n detriment. The Pope’s behaviour shows that he is of the same opinion,\r\n for if he thought that Milan and ourselves were what we ought to be he\r\n would never attempt anything against this State. But one wounds him\r\n here, another caresses him there, and between them all we, exclaimed\r\n H.E., go to the devil. He said he would like to meet you and the Lord\r\n Lodovico in one room and discuss matters, and did not think it would\r\n be difficult to convince you that this our League must be united not\r\n only in deeds but in demonstrations. That it was evident the Pope\r\n did much for you, he had for instance made your son a cardinal at an\r\n unheard-of age, and therefore it was thought that if you insisted\r\n things would go differently. He then added that neither he nor the\r\n King had heard anything about the troop of Jacopo Conti or the Count’s\r\n dismissal, though Jacopo had written to him about this a month ago.\r\n H.E. said it seemed as if you suspected him, though he would do all to\r\n forward your projects. I replied it was true that the Pope showed some\r\n regard for you and had acceded to your wishes as to the Cardinalate\r\n and one or two other matters, but that it was possible your influence\r\n did not extend to the affairs of H.M. the King, because although you\r\n could do much you could not do all. Also that Your Magnificence had\r\n been informed that H.E. had greatly encouraged the Count not to give\r\n up Monte Agutolo, which was a blow aimed at you; so that if he heeded\r\n not your honour and interest, he would find others do the same. He had\r\n not yet been told of the Count’s dismissal or about Jacopo’s troop,\r\n because they were connected together, and it was impossible to write\r\n until affairs were settled. Owing to the disgraceful conduct of the\r\n Count about Monte Agutolo you and all our citizens had determined\r\n to dismiss him, and had not informed H.M. the King or H.E., as they\r\n thought pressure might be brought to bear on them to retain him and\r\n they did not wish to say no to H.E. I added that as H.E. loved you\r\n he ought to be pleased if the Pope showed you any favour, because\r\n he might be sure that if you had to choose between them you would\r\n leave the Pope and follow H.E. That he was to consult with H.M. the\r\n King as to the particular thing they wanted and that I was sure you\r\n would always be ready to do anything honourable, but they must not\r\n make vague complaints. Lorenzo does nothing because perhaps Their\r\n Excellencies do not know exactly what they really want, or he could\r\n not do what they desired. But that I was certain that any just and\r\n honourable service he could render H.M. and H.E. he would do it. H.E.\r\n replied that he would consult with H.M., and give me an answer. I see\r\n he wants our ambassador and the ambassador of Milan to tell the Pope\r\n that they will not tolerate any measures being taken against the King.\r\n Then he added that he had sent a competent man to Barbary to acquire\r\n one or two horses fit for racing, in order to send them to you; _et\r\n alia non occurrunt_. I commend myself to you, may God grant you\r\n felicity.--Naples, March 9, 1489 (1490).[382]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici, _from Bagno San Filippo, to his son_ Piero\r\n\r\n Piero,--Enclosed is a letter from Baccio; the bearer is the man of\r\n whom he writes, who is passing through Florence.

I wish thee to show him all\r\n those in the garden, and also what we have in the study; in short,\r\n whatever seems best to thee, and thus to give him pleasure.--Bagno San\r\n Filippo, May 9, 1490.[383]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to the_ Commissaries of Pistoja\r\n\r\n Magnificent Commissaries,--Two or three days ago I wrote to Your\r\n Magnificences about the liberation of Bastiano di Nanni, imprisoned\r\n by you and in danger of losing his life. And although I have not\r\n had an answer, yet considering the contents of the enclosed letter\r\n from Ser Andrea who lives in Siena with regard to our Republic, I\r\n have determined to write again to beg you, not in a general way but\r\n from my heart, no longer to delay in acceding to the request of the\r\n Magnificent Signory Of Siena, to whom I am under such obligations that\r\n if they do not obtain their desire great blame and dishonour will fall\r\n on me. Your Magnificences are aware that when one embarks on such an\r\n undertaking one spares no effort to accomplish it with honour. For the\r\n love of God deliver me from this annoyance, which is considerable, and\r\n set the aforesaid Bastiano free according to their wish, for their\r\n character is such that either good or great evil will result. I do\r\n not think you will wait for another communication from me, delay will\r\n greatly diminish the trust the Sienese have in me.--San Filippo, May\r\n 21, 1490, at midday.\r\n\r\n                                             Laurentius de Medicis.[384]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Ser Andrea _at Siena_\r\n\r\n Early this morning I had your letter telling me about Dormi and the\r\n swelling which began in his body and then settled in his right knee,\r\n and of the remedies applied by those farriers. You were right to\r\n have the horse doctored at once, and to write fully to me. Wait until\r\n the day of the race [the Palio at Siena], and if the farrier and the\r\n jockey think the horse is not in a fit state to run, we forbid his\r\n starting as it might do him harm, and indeed injure him permanently,\r\n even if you think he could run. I leave it to you, who being on the\r\n spot can judge better than I can here. I am not inclined to send\r\n another horse, we are too near the day of the race, he would arrive\r\n tired, and do us little honour.--Florence, July 28, 1490.\r\n\r\n                                             Laurentius de Medicis.[385]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Giovanni Lanfredini, _Florentine Ambassador at\r\nRome_\r\n\r\n Two days ago I met by chance the Count della Mirandola riding in the\r\n outskirts of Florence. He is living very quietly in a villa near\r\n by, immersed in his studies. He desires at last to know what his\r\n future is to be, for having obeyed His Holiness hitherto and being\r\n decided to obey him implicitly in the future, he wishes to have some\r\n indication that His Holiness accepts his obedience in the form of a\r\n Brief, whereby the Pope acknowledges him as an obedient son and a\r\n good Christian, which I believe him to be. Among other proofs of this\r\n he has converted a young Jew who has been translating for him from\r\n the Hebrew language, of which he is a perfect master, whom he has\r\n persuaded to become a Christian. This is not the act of a heretic.\r\n I much desire that for the honour of His Holiness and for my own\r\n satisfaction this matter should be finished, and that the virtue and\r\n goodness of the said Count Giovanni should have as great a weight\r\n as the calumnies and suggestions of others. By nature he is devoted\r\n to His Holiness and does not dwell on what is past. Once delivered\r\n from this contumacy he will be the partisan and faithful servant of\r\n His Holiness, who to my thinking will thereby gain much.--August 11,\r\n 1490.[386]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to_ Giovanni Lanfredini, _Florentine Ambassador at\r\nRome_\r\n\r\n By your letter of the 13th I understand that the Pope has taken\r\n umbrage at the note presented by you, so do not proceed further with\r\n it. Anything that vexes His Sanctity annoys me, and I should be very\r\n sorry if he thought that any act or word of mine was not dictated\r\n by a desire for the good of His Holiness. You can assure him that\r\n I am always his servant and shall ever be. If I advised moderation\r\n in these proceedings against the King [of Naples] I only did so for\r\n the aforesaid reasons. As I wrote the other day, it seems to me\r\n necessary that His Holiness should decide on following one of three\r\n paths: either enforce his will by war against the King, or come to\r\n some agreement, or, if an honourable agreement is not possible, to\r\n temporise and wait for better times. The first would be the most\r\n honourable, but I conceive dangerous and very costly; indeed I do not\r\n think it possible unless the Neapolitan dynasty is changed. For this,\r\n according to my views, three things are necessary: either Venice or\r\n Milan must be a party to the enterprise, or the new ruler must be\r\n strong and well supplied with men and money, or the Holy Father must\r\n prepare to assert himself without stint of money or other things, to\r\n carry the thing through. It is indispensable that the Pope and the\r\n new ruler, whoever he may be, should be stronger than the King alone,\r\n supposing always that Venice adheres and would prevent Milan from\r\n helping the King. If they were understood with the Neapolitan Barons,\r\n or other such small folk, so much the better. I may be mistaken as to\r\n the first proposition when I dissuaded His Holiness from following\r\n it, but the state of things does not seem to me propitious. Perhaps\r\n I am not enough versed in all the secrets and therefore see and\r\n anticipate wrongly. His Holiness must have some promises or hopes, for\r\n the choice lies between Spain and France. Spain does not appear to me\r\n strong enough, particularly as regards money. What reliance is to be\r\n placed on France, seeing the French nature, I know not. Supposing she\r\n changed her nature I should agree with our Holy Father that it would\r\n be the best solution, for there would be less danger in augmenting the\r\n power of one of the house of Lorraine than of Spain, for the Duke of\r\n Lorraine is not King of France and we see by experience that the King\r\n of Naples is far more influenced by Spain than the Duke of Lorraine is\r\n by France. It is true the Kings of Naples and Spain are not friends,\r\n and that whoever is King of Naples would work for his own hand. For\r\n all these reasons, although there may be others I do not understand,\r\n I cannot advise the Pope to undertake such an enterprise now; and\r\n in that case it is unwise to exasperate the King with citations and\r\n other threats. Even were His Holiness fully prepared to go forward I\r\n think he ought to avoid the slightest sign of ill-will, in order not\r\n to incur any danger from what the King might say or do. This danger\r\n seems to me to exist, therefore he would do better to dissimulate\r\n and make secret preparations, than to show anger before being ready\r\n to strike, which would only give an opportunity to others to make\r\n ready and to attack. So for every reason in the first proposition I\r\n do not think it wise to cite the King. As to the second I may also be\r\n mistaken, because conditions may have been proposed of which I am not\r\n aware, and which may be rendered feasible by this very citation, if\r\n the affair is matured and almost settled. In this case the assumption\r\n of superiority may help to decide matters. But if there is nothing\r\n more than I know the affair seems embittered and not at all easy of\r\n solution; therefore such methods might lead to a scandal or even\r\n to an open rupture, instead of to an agreement. The advantages of\r\n temporising cannot, I think, be denied. There can be no doubt that\r\n it is better to arrange matters, having due regard to the reputation\r\n of His Holiness, than to tempt fortune; for you know better than I\r\n do that the King can do much harm. But, as I said before, I do not\r\n know enough about these matters so cannot say more. If the Pope has\r\n good reasons for his fearless attitude let me know them to relieve my\r\n mind, for though not of a timid nature I am far more anxious about\r\n his affairs than about my own, because of the trust he reposes in\r\n me. If His Holiness is satisfied, I have such faith in his prudence\r\n and authority that I shall be tranquillised. But until I hear these\r\n reasons I confess that I am uneasy. For the love of God let me know,\r\n as I do not feel at all well. The Pope must not on any account imagine\r\n that I think, do, or act, in any way against his interests, for the\r\n benefits I have received from His Holiness, and those I hope for,\r\n derive from his power and reputation. My opinion of the Lord Lodovico\r\n I have expressed, and have said what I thought of him. My intentions\r\n are loyal, and as I depend much on His Holiness I can only repeat that\r\n if he can come to an honourable understanding with the King it would\r\n be, I consider, better than war. If there is any difficulty about\r\n this I would do my utmost to arrange matters to the Pope’s honour and\r\n security; supposing always that the above-mentioned conditions, of\r\n which I know nothing, and which would make it possible to act against\r\n the King, are non-existent. If they do exist I am sure the King would\r\n consent to honourable terms because he would understand what evil\r\n might befall him otherwise. But all my suppositions are useless if\r\n the Pope has secret information unknown to me. I do not think my\r\n open speaking can offend His Holiness, for our fortunes are bound\r\n up together. I wish to be allowed to say what I think, but will act\r\n according to the wishes of our Holy Father. Thank him most heartily\r\n for the loving and kindly reply about the Servite Order with regard\r\n to Messer Giovanni. For all these things I am deeply indebted to His\r\n Holiness. I am very glad you have been to Cervetri and S. Severa, and\r\n most pleased that you were satisfied with the way Signor Francesco\r\n (Cibò) treats his subjects. God knows his honour and well-being are\r\n as dear to me as my own. I beg of you to do all you can to induce our\r\n Holy Father to arrange this affair of S. Severa. You see yourself\r\n the importance and the necessity of adding this property to that of\r\n Cervetri. I should also like to know about the affair of Gallese in\r\n order to reply to the friend who is coming here soon. It is urgent\r\n that His Holiness should once for all arrange the affairs of Signor\r\n Francesco so that I should not be daily worried about them, and that\r\n we can live in peace and harmony. To speak plainly, Signor Francesco\r\n has not the position the nephew of a Pope ought to have, and yet we\r\n are now approaching the seventh year of the Pontificate. More regard\r\n should be shown to the increasing family, which is a valid reason for\r\n our Holy Father’s aid.--Florence, October 17, 1489.[387]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to the_ King of England\r\n\r\n Serene Majesty,--When this Signory writes to recommend one of their\r\n citizens they have such hope and faith in the clemency and kindness of\r\n Your Majesty, that neither do they doubt of their gracious reception\r\n nor do I consider it necessary to intervene in their behalf. Yet, to\r\n satisfy my conscience, being in duty bound to help the citizens of\r\n this Republic, I cannot refrain from recommending with all reverence\r\n and humility to Your Majesty Filippo del Vigna for the affair he will\r\n explain. I assure Your Majesty that no greater token of interest\r\n and clemency towards this city can be given than to accept the\r\n aforesaid Filippo as a faithful servant, and to aid him to recover his\r\n indemnity, and I, for my part, should be everlastingly grateful.\r\n\r\n I commend myself humbly to Your Majesty.[388]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnolo Poliziano _to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici _in Florence_\r\n\r\n Magnificent Patron,--My last letter was from Ferrara. In Padua I\r\n found some good books, _i.e._ Simplicio, on the Sky; Alessandro, on\r\n the Topica; Giovan Grammatico, on the Posteriora and the Syllogism; a\r\n David on Aristotle; none of which we have in Florence. I also found\r\n a Greek scribe in Padua and arranged with him at a ducat for every\r\n fifteen pages.\r\n\r\n Maestro Piero Leoni showed me his books: among them I found M. Manlio,\r\n an old astronomer and poet, which I have brought with me to Venice\r\n to compare with one I have bought; I have never seen a more ancient\r\n book. _Similiter_ he possesses certain books of Galieno _de dogmate\r\n Aristotelis et Hippocratis_ in Greek, of which he will give us a copy\r\n in Padua, so we shall have gained something.\r\n\r\n In Venice I have found some books of Archimedes and Eron,\r\n mathematicians, which we have not got, and a Frunuto _de Deis_, and\r\n other valuable things. So papa Janni[389] will have writing enough to\r\n do for some time.\r\n\r\n Niceno’s [Cardinal] library we were not able to see. Messer\r\n Aldovrandini, the Duke of Ferrara’s ambassador, _in cujus domo\r\n habitamus_, went to the Prince but was met with a blunt refusal.\r\n He asked for Count Giovanni [Pico della Mirandola], not for me, as\r\n I thought it better not to mention your name in the affair. Messer\r\n Antonio Vinciguerra and Messer Antonio Pizamanno, one of the two\r\n philosophers who came incognito to Florence to see the Count, and a\r\n brother of Messer Zaccheria Barbaro, are engaged in trying to overcome\r\n this obstinacy; everything possible will be tried. This is all I have\r\n to say about books.\r\n\r\n Messer Piero Leoni has been greatly persecuted in Padua and has no\r\n patients either there or in Venice. Yet he is a good doctor and held\r\n in high esteem. I have caused him to be sounded by the Count as to\r\n coming to Tuscany, but I think it will be difficult. He does not like\r\n Padua and the society does not please him, _ut ipse ait; negut tamen\r\n se elle in Thusciam agere_.\r\n\r\n Nicoletto would come to Pisa but wants a benefice, _hoc est_ one of\r\n those canonries. His name stands high in Padua and his method is good;\r\n but, _nisi fallor_, he is one of these odd fantastical men. He it was\r\n who mentioned the benefice to me; so I warn you.\r\n\r\n This morning I paid a visit to Messer Zaccheria Barbaro and assured\r\n him of your affection &c.; he replied tearfully _et ut visum est_ from\r\n his heart: all resolved itself into _in te uno spem esse_. _Ostendit\r\n se nosse quantum tibi debeat_: so do what you intended, _ut favens ad\r\n majora_. The Legate, who has returned from Rome, _et qui tecum locutus\r\n est Florentiæ_, is not at all of their way of thinking, _ut ajunt_.\r\n\r\n Messer Zaccheria showed me a very beautiful antique earthen vase which\r\n was sent to him lately from Greece, and told me that if I thought you\r\n would like it he would send it to you with two smaller ones. I said\r\n it was just what Your Magnificence would admire _et tandem_ it will\r\n be yours. To-morrow morning the box shall be made and I will send it\r\n off. I do not think you have so fine a one _in eo genere_: it is about\r\n three spans high and four wide.\r\n\r\n The Count [Pico della Mirandola] has bad eyes and has not been out of\r\n the house since he came to Venice.\r\n\r\n _Item_ yester evening I paid a visit to the learned Cassandra Fidele\r\n and greeted her in your name. She is no less wonderful, Lorenzo, in\r\n the vulgar tongue than in Latin; most discreet, _et meis oculis etiam_\r\n handsome. I came away astounded. To you she is most partial and talked\r\n about you with such understanding _quasi te intus et in cute norit_.\r\n One of these days she intends to go to Florence to see you, so prepare\r\n to do her honour.\r\n\r\n I have no more to say at present, save that your causing Greek books\r\n to be copied and the favour you show to learned men sets you higher in\r\n the esteem and honour of the world than any man has enjoyed for many\r\n years. Other particulars I reserve for my return. I commend myself to\r\n Your Magnificence. I have not yet used the letter of exchange as I\r\n have had no need of it.--Venice, June 20, 1491.\r\n\r\n The servant of Your Magnificence,\r\n\r\n                                                Angelus Politianus.[390]\r\n\r\n\r\nPier Filippo Pandolfini, _Florentine Ambassador at Rome, to_ Lorenzo\r\nde’ Medici\r\n\r\n Monsignor d’Arles told me yesterday morning that the Signoria of\r\n Venice and all the Venetian gentlemen are very irate with us for\r\n two things. First because, according to them, we tried through the\r\n Soldan to prevent that journey of theirs. Secondly on account of the\r\n agreement about wool from England, which they have so much at heart\r\n that they could not be more angry and are decided to upset it at\r\n any cost. They have ordered that all ships carrying wool to Pisa,\r\n no matter to whom they belong, are to be prevented from loading in\r\n Candia, Cyprus, or any other place where they have ports, and that no\r\n ship of theirs is to touch at Porto Pisano. I do not know whether it\r\n would be good to inform Tommaso Portinari so that he might tell the\r\n King of England and explain to him the harm this decision will do to\r\n H.M. and to his subjects, and that the Venetians want to be masters\r\n and dictate laws to them.\r\n\r\n Maestro Leoni was here this morning and tells me he is engaged at\r\n Padua for two years certain and one year optional, at 2000 golden\r\n pieces yearly; and he has accepted with the intention, if he is not\r\n prevented, of practising medicine at Venice. He has taken this step\r\n deliberately and left Pisa with this intent, but has been idle for\r\n some time for his own justification. At Pisa he thought he was not\r\n well treated by the authorities and told me much about it, and that he\r\n was not regarded with the consideration he considers he had a right\r\n to expect. You he praises highly and says that he perceives that\r\n whatever good he experienced was solely through your influence and not\r\n on account of his own merits. He intends to show what learning and\r\n capabilities he possesses and to leave a name behind him. Wherever he\r\n may be he affirms that he is ever yours.--July 1491.[391]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiero Leoni _of Spoleto to_ Lorenzo de’ Medici\r\n\r\n I have heard what has been ordered to Your Magnificence as to the\r\n water and what the effect has been. First I must make an examination\r\n and Your Magnificence will cease taking it. It will be better not\r\n to wait until winter begins to lay in the usual provision, and Your\r\n Magnificence can take first Morba for a week and then Villa for\r\n another week. The less interval there is between the two the better.\r\n During this time I will make a trial of the said water which has\r\n arrived here in safety. I have not been able to do so on account of\r\n being occupied with lectures until the first August: then I had to go\r\n to Venice to pay my duty to the Doge and the Signoria. As soon as I\r\n have settled the Venetian business I shall make a trial at Padua of\r\n that water for a purpose of my own, for I need it, and according to\r\n the effect obtained I shall see whether we have something different\r\n from _arzente_[392] water; if I find it is different, as I think,\r\n when I have tried it, I will see how to make it suit the case of\r\n Your Magnificence. If it be _arzente_ water, we shall have unmasked\r\n it, which will not be at all unpleasing to me. Your Magnificence can\r\n take the Morba water without further advice, except when the wind is\r\n northerly, for then it is of little or no use. Let us hope the weather\r\n will soon be fine again and then Your Magnificence is to ride fast\r\n and far after drinking the water when fasting, morning and evening.\r\n Beware of cold and damp feet, of moonlight, and of the air at sunset,\r\n and do not eat pears or swallow grape pips. I received Proculus, which\r\n has given me the more pleasure that I have long wished to possess it,\r\n and finding that it is as excellent as I supposed I shall have it\r\n translated. When finished I will do as Your Magnificence says. I have\r\n heard that Lascari found in Calabria a commentary by Proculus on the\r\n Heraclitus of Plato. I beg Your Magnificence, when you know where this\r\n commentary is, to try and get it, or to tell me so that I may try. It\r\n must be valuable because the matter in itself is good and the author\r\n is the most competent man there is in such things. No more at present.\r\n I commend myself to Your Magnificence.--Padua, August 19, 1491.[393]\r\n\r\n\r\nMatteo Franco _at Rome to_ Ser Piero Dovizi _at Florence_\r\n\r\n Ser Piero, you know how long ago I told you of the want of order in\r\n this house and how things went from bad to worse so that I gave up\r\n fighting; and how a Florentine was like a Cross among devils. Also\r\n I informed you of Madonna’s [Maddalena] tribulations with regard to\r\n divers matters. But as I suspect you never read my letters to the\r\n end, probably these things will be new to you. With this doubt and\r\n also as a satisfaction to myself, I write, for I am bursting with\r\n pent-up rage, and know not where to turn for advice or help. When I\r\n see such coldness and want of care and affection for persons of far\r\n more importance than Franco, I cease to trouble about my own affairs,\r\n but about theirs I am in despair. No one, man or woman, ever comes to\r\n this house, save once in a blue moon, to ask whether Madonna is alive\r\n or dead. Let be that they grant her no authority, but they might ask\r\n if she is alive. Ever since our return she has been shut up in the\r\n house, save the two days spent at Cervetri, twice that she went to see\r\n the Pope, and one evening when she supped at the bank. She is always\r\n ailing and there does not seem to be a man living who takes interest\r\n in her. Cursed be that milk-cheese, those curds, those pears, that\r\n flask of trebbiano, that bundle of fennel and those medlars, that have\r\n never, never been sent to her by you or by anybody. These Genoese with\r\n the Pope have the most beautiful loggia and all the greatest marvels\r\n of the world, let alone other things of more value. While she, poor\r\n patient child, the daughter of such a man and so perfect and charming\r\n in herself, is less esteemed than would be the daughter of an exile,\r\n and as I well know there are always prevarications, excuses and\r\n justifications, saying that notice must not be taken of small things\r\n and that one day all of a sudden we shall hear the thunder and see\r\n the lightning of some important event. We shall see, my Ser Piero,\r\n but I have no faith in excuses, and the conclusion is that if you do\r\n not help to keep this house things you do not expect will happen, for\r\n which you will be sorry.\r\n\r\n I have written all this, full of despair and anger, to others besides\r\n yourself. The bad health of Madonna Maddalena and the thoughtless\r\n behaviour of my Lord in keeping her up, for all this winter he has\r\n gambled every night, supping at six or seven and coming to bed at\r\n daylight, and she will not, and cannot, eat or sleep without him.\r\n Thus she has lost sleep and appetite and has become as thin as a\r\n lizard, as I told you. To the ambassador and Noferi and Ser Niccolò\r\n and to Christ, I have told this every day and kept them informed. The\r\n ambassador replies: “It is your business to write to Lorenzo, what can\r\n I do in the matter? Write, and let me act.” And Noferi says: “I fear\r\n this girl will not live long, and my Lord says and does &c., and they\r\n ought to be warned at Florence, &c.” Ser Niccolò, whom I asked about\r\n either summoning Maestro Piero Leoni or describing her symptoms to him\r\n and sending him the prescriptions of the doctors here, for the girl\r\n has great faith in Maestro Leoni as he treated her mother and herself\r\n and knows her constitution, made me copy out all the recipes of the\r\n doctors and said it would be well to write and that he would do so.\r\n Then he got immersed in grand doings and all has come to nought. Poor\r\n Franco runs here and runs there angered inside and out, and his heart\r\n is bursting. The worst is that he has not enough authority or brains\r\n to set things right.\r\n\r\n Madonna’s illness is caused by sitting up too late at night, eating at\r\n hours she is not used to, and remaining shut up in the house all day\r\n without taking any exercise; then, like her mother, she is melancholy,\r\n thin, and pensive, and takes every caprice and folly of her husband’s\r\n to heart. She thinks and dreams of nought else, so great is her love\r\n of him. She is slowly pining away and this seems to me the most\r\n alarming symptom, for nothing she eats or drinks does her any good or\r\n gives her any pleasure....\r\n\r\n Ser Piero, I beg you as earnestly as I can to excuse me and with\r\n clasped hands I entreat you to get me away from here. First because,\r\n as I have told you several times, I cannot bear it any longer, and\r\n then because I get small honour and less gain. I know what I say.\r\n Madonna can do little for me and I can do even less for her in the\r\n state to which they have reduced her. I always told you none but a\r\n Franco would have endured this life. No more at present. Let us study\r\n to find a remedy for what is more important, and see that this girl\r\n should be served rather like the daughter of her father than the wife\r\n of him she has married. Let the rest go as it will. I commend myself\r\n to you.--Rome, January 16, 1492.\r\n\r\n                                                       Your Franco.[394]\r\n\r\nLorenzo’s end was fast approaching. The following extracts from\r\nManfredi’s letters show how terribly he suffered, and with what\r\nfortitude he bore extreme pain. From his last words to Filippo Valori\r\nand Andrea Cambini, who accompanied the young Cardinal Giovanni to\r\nRome, “I entrust the youth of my son to you, you will not see me\r\nagain,” it is evident he knew death was near. But in the long letter to\r\nhis son at Rome he makes no allusion to his own health, as though he\r\ndid not wish to cloud the lad’s first entrance into life. It is full\r\nof political wisdom, knowledge of the world, and fatherly foresight.\r\nAfter Giovanni’s departure Lorenzo rallied a little, and on March 21st\r\nwas carried to Careggi, attended by his favourite sister Bianca, his\r\ndaughter Lucrezia, his eldest son Piero, and the faithful Poliziano.\r\n\r\n\r\nManfredo di Manfredi, _Ambassador from Ferrara to Florence, to the_\r\nDuke Ercole d’Este\r\n\r\n ... The Magnificent Lorenzo has not been able to see any of\r\n the ambassadors on account of his gout which gives him great\r\n pain....--Florence, January 16, 1492.[395]\r\n\r\n ... Since several days the Magnificent Lorenzo is very ill and much\r\n tormented with pain all over the body save in the head. His agony is\r\n such that _est res miranda_ how he can live. It is true the doctors do\r\n not think it is an _infirmitas ad mortem_, but he is very weak from\r\n want of rest. May God restore him to his usual health, for it really\r\n moves one’s compassion to hear the state he is in....--Florence,\r\n February 11, 1492.[396]\r\n\r\n ...

It is thought that this perverse and very cold\r\n weather affects him....--Florence, March 8, 1492.[398]\r\n\r\n I have nought to report to Your Excellency save that yesterday the\r\n Most Rev. Cardinal de’ Medici [Giovanni, Lorenzo’s second son] left\r\n for Rome. Last Saturday he received the hat in a certain abbey, called\r\n the Abbey of Fiesole, and then in his Cardinal’s robes, accompanied\r\n by us ambassadors, many bishops, and a large number of citizens, made\r\n a triumphal entry into the city. Dismounting at the palace of the\r\n Signoria he paid them a visit. He mounted again and we accompanied him\r\n to his father’s house. Next day, with the same following he went to S.\r\n Liberata [the cathedral] to hear mass, which was celebrated by eight\r\n bishops with great solemnity, and at which the Illustrious Signoria\r\n assisted. At the close the Cardinal took leave of the Signoria in\r\n the church and accompanied by us went to his father’s house where a\r\n magnificent banquet was prepared, at which we ambassadors assisted\r\n (having been previously invited) and sixty of the principal citizens\r\n of this State. The house was most richly adorned. Before we rose from\r\n table a great number of chiselled silver vases were presented to the\r\n Cardinal on behalf of the Signoria. A stupendous sight, for the vases\r\n were large and well ornamented. They were valued at 10,000 ducats or\r\n more, which may well be, as they weighed more than 1000 pounds. We\r\n ambassadors then went with His Illustrious Reverence to his room and\r\n rich and handsome silver vases were brought by the various Communes,\r\n and the Jews of the city, but His Lordship would not accept them and\r\n gave them back to the donors with fair words of thanks. Likewise\r\n he accepted nothing from any citizen save from his relations, who\r\n gave him splendid gifts. The Magnificent Lorenzo, though in pain,\r\n came into the hall where we were dining to see the Cardinal and us\r\n ambassadors, and has begun to ride again, although often seized with\r\n pain....--Florence, March 13, 1492.[399]\r\n\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici _to his son_, Cardinal Giovanni, _at Rome, in March\r\n1492_\r\n\r\n Messer Giovanni,--You are much beholden to our Lord God, as we all\r\n are for your sake, as besides many benefits and honours our house has\r\n received from Him it has pleased Him to bestow on you the highest\r\n dignity our family has yet enjoyed. Great as this is it is much\r\n enhanced by circumstances, particularly your youth and our condition.\r\n Therefore my first recommendation is that you endeavour to be grateful\r\n to our Lord God, remembering every hour that it is not by your own\r\n merits or solicitude that you have attained the Cardinalate, but by\r\n the grace of God. Show your gratitude to Him by leading a saintly,\r\n exemplary, and honest life. You are the more bound to do this because\r\n during your youth you have shown a disposition which gives hope of\r\n good fruit. It would be indeed most shameful, contrary to your duty,\r\n and to my expectations if at a time when others generally acquire more\r\n reason and a better understanding of life, you should forget the good\r\n precepts learned as a boy. It is incumbent on you to try and lighten\r\n the burden of the dignity you have attained by leading a pure life\r\n and persevering in the studies suitable to your profession. I was\r\n greatly pleased last year to learn that without being reminded by any\r\n one you had been several times to confession and to communion, for\r\n I conceive there is no better way of obtaining the grace of God than\r\n by habituating oneself to persevere in these duties. This seems to\r\n me the best advice I can begin with. I know, as you are now going to\r\n Rome, that sink of all iniquities, that you will find some difficulty\r\n in following it, as bad examples are always catching, and inciters to\r\n vice will not be wanting. Your promotion to the Cardinalate, as you\r\n may imagine, at your age and for the other reasons already mentioned,\r\n will be viewed with great envy, and those who were not able to prevent\r\n your attaining this dignity will endeavour, little by little, to\r\n diminish it by lowering you in public estimation and causing you to\r\n slide into the same ditch into which they have themselves fallen,\r\n counting on success because of your youth. You must be all the firmer\r\n in your stand against these difficulties, as at present one sees such\r\n a lack of virtue in the College. I recollect however to have known\r\n a good many learned and good men in the College, leading exemplary\r\n lives. It will be well that you should follow their example, for by so\r\n doing you will be the more known and esteemed as being different from\r\n the others. It is imperative above all things that you should avoid as\r\n you would Scylla and Charybdis the reputation of being a hypocrite and\r\n of evil fame. Be not ostentatious, and have a care to avoid anything\r\n offensive in conduct and in conversation, without affecting austerity\r\n or severity. These are things you will in time understand and practise\r\n better, I conceive, than I can write them. You know how important is\r\n the position and the example of a Cardinal, and that the world would\r\n be far better if the Cardinals were what they ought to be, for then\r\n there would always be a good Pope, from whom emanates, one may say,\r\n peace for all Christians. Make every effort therefore to be this, if\r\n others had done so we might hope for universal good. Nothing is more\r\n difficult than to hold converse with men of various characters, and\r\n in this I can ill advise you; only recollect when with the Cardinals\r\n and other men of rank to try and be charitable and respectful in your\r\n conversation, weighing your reasons well without being influenced by\r\n the passions of others; for many desiring what they cannot attain turn\r\n reason into abuse. Satisfy your conscience therefore by taking care\r\n that your conversation with every man should be devoid of offence.\r\n This seems to me a general rule most applicable in your case, for\r\n should passion by chance make an enemy, as his enmity would have no\r\n reasonable cause he may sometimes return with more ease to the old\r\n friendship. It will be better I think on this, your first visit to\r\n Rome, to use your ears more than your tongue. To-day I have given you\r\n entirely to our Lord God and to Holy Church; it is therefore essential\r\n that you become a good ecclesiastic, cherishing the honour and the\r\n State of Holy Church and of the Apostolic See above aught else in\r\n this world, and devoting yourself entirely to their interests. While\r\n doing this it will not be difficult for you to aid the city and our\r\n house, for the city being united to the Church you will represent\r\n the solid chain, and our house is part of the city. Although it is\r\n impossible to foresee what may happen I think it is likely that a way\r\n will be found to save, as the proverb says, the goat and the cabbages,\r\n always keeping steadfastly to your above-mentioned duty of setting the\r\n interests of the Church above all else. You are the youngest Cardinal,\r\n not only of the College, but the youngest that has hitherto been made,\r\n it is therefore most necessary that where you have to compete with\r\n the others you should be the most eager and the humblest, and avoid\r\n making others wait for you in Chapel, in Consistory, or in Deputation.\r\n You will soon learn who has a good or an evil reputation. With the\r\n latter avoid any great intimacy, not only on your own account, but\r\n for the sake of public opinion; converse in a general way with all.\r\n I advise you on feast-days to be rather below than above moderation,\r\n and would rather see a well-appointed stable and a well-ordered and\r\n cleanly household than magnificence and pomp. Let your life be regular\r\n and reduce your expenses gradually in the future, for the retinue and\r\n the master being both new at first it will be difficult. Jewels and\r\n silken stuffs must be used sparingly by one in your position. Rather\r\n have a few good antiques and fine books, and well-bred and learned\r\n attendants, than many of them. Ask people to your own house oftener\r\n than you accept invitations to theirs, but do both sparingly. Eat\r\n plain food and take much exercise, for those who wear your habit, if\r\n not careful, easily contract maladies. The rank of Cardinal is as\r\n secure as it is great, men therefore often become negligent; they\r\n conceive they have done enough and that without exertion they can\r\n preserve their position. This is often prejudicial to character and\r\n to life, and a thing against which you must guard; rather trust too\r\n little than too much in others. One rule I recommend to you above all\r\n others, and that is to get up betimes; besides being good for health\r\n one can meditate over and arrange all the business of the following\r\n day, and in your position, having to say the office, to study, to give\r\n audiences &c. you will find it most useful. Another thing absolutely\r\n necessary to one in your station is to reflect, particularly at this,\r\n the commencement of your career, in the evening on all you have to do\r\n next day, so that an unforeseen event may not come upon you unawares.\r\n As to speaking in the Consistory, I think it would be more seemly\r\n and becoming if you refer all that comes before you to His Holiness,\r\n alleging that as you are young and inexperienced you consider it\r\n your duty to submit everything to the most learned judgment of His\r\n Holiness. You will probably be asked to intercede in various matters\r\n with our Holy Father. Be cautious however at the beginning to ask as\r\n few favours as possible and not to bother him; the disposition of\r\n the Pope is to be grateful to those who do not break his ears. Bear\r\n this in mind in order not to annoy him. When you see him, talk about\r\n amusing things, and if you have to beg, do it with all humility and\r\n modesty. This will please him and be in accordance with his nature.\r\n Keep well.--Florence.[400]\r\n\r\n\r\nCardinal Giovanni de’ Medici _to his father_ Lorenzo Magnifico Viro\r\nLaurentio de Medici Pater optimo\r\n\r\n _Salvus sis_,--In case ...[401] (I) did not tell you of some things.\r\n On Friday morning I was given a public reception and went accompanied\r\n by all the Cardinals, nearly the whole court, and very heavy rain,\r\n from S.M. del Popolo to the palace and from the palace to Campo di\r\n Fiore. Our Holy Father received me most graciously: I hardly spoke\r\n to him. The following day the ambassadors waited on our Holy Father;\r\n their audience was most satisfactory. The Pope desired to hear me the\r\n day after, which is to-day. I have been, and His Holiness spoke as\r\n lovingly as was possible to me, and reminded me, and advised me, to do\r\n something when I visited these Cardinals, and I have begun to do so\r\n with those to whom as yet I have paid visits. Another time I will tell\r\n you who they are. All professed the greatest goodwill towards you. Of\r\n former things I know that you have been told. Of myself I have nought\r\n to say save that I will try hard to do you honour. _De me proloqui\r\n ulterius, nefas._ The news that you are so much better has been a\r\n great joy to me and I have no other wish than to hear this often. For\r\n this I send thanks to Ser Piero [Leoni, the doctor]. I commend myself\r\n to you. No more at present.--Rome, March 25, 1492.\r\n\r\n                                                        Jo. Filius.[402]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Jacopo Antiquario, Poliziano describes the malady from\r\nwhich Lorenzo had been suffering and then continues:\r\n\r\n ... The day before his death, being at his villa of Careggi, he grew\r\n so weak that all hope of his recovery vanished. Perceiving this,\r\n like a wise man he called for the confessor to purge himself of past\r\n sins. This same confessor told me afterwards that he marvelled to see\r\n with what courage and constancy Lorenzo prepared himself for death;\r\n how well he ordered all things pertaining thereunto, and with what\r\n faith and religious feeling he reflected on the world to come. Towards\r\n midnight while he was quietly meditating he was informed that the\r\n priest bearing the Holy Sacrament had arrived. Rousing himself he\r\n exclaimed, “It shall never be said that my Lord who created and saved\r\n me shall come to me--in my room--raise me, I beg of you, raise me\r\n quickly so that I may go and meet Him.” Saying this he raised himself\r\n as well as he could and, supported by his servants, advanced to meet\r\n the priest in the outer room. There crying he knelt down.\r\n\r\nPoliziano gives a long prayer recited by Lorenzo and then continues:\r\n\r\n These and other things he said sobbing, while all around cried\r\n bitterly. At length the priest ordered that he should be raised from\r\n the ground and carried to his bed, in order to receive the Viaticum in\r\n more comfort. For some time he resisted, but at last out of respect\r\n for the priest he consented. In bed repeating almost the same prayer,\r\n with much gravity and devotion he received the body and blood of\r\n Christ. Then he devoted himself to consoling his son Piero, for the\r\n others were not there, and exhorted him to bear this law of necessity\r\n with courage, feeling sure that the aid of Heaven would be vouchsafed\r\n to him, as it had been to himself in many and divers occasions, if\r\n he only acted wisely. Meanwhile your Lazarus, the doctor from Pavia,\r\n arrived, most learned as it seemed to me, but summoned too late to be\r\n of any use. Yet to do something he ordered various precious stones to\r\n be pounded together in a mortar for I know not what kind of medicine.\r\n Lorenzo thereupon asked the servants what the doctor was doing in\r\n his room and what he was preparing, and when I answered that he was\r\n composing a remedy to comfort his intestines he recognised my voice,\r\n and looking kindly as is his wont: “Oh Angiolo,” he said, “art thou\r\n here?” and raising his languid arms took both my hands and pressed\r\n them tightly. I could not stifle my sobs or stay my tears though I\r\n tried to hide them by turning my face away. But he showed no emotion\r\n and continued to press my hands between his. When he saw that I could\r\n not speak for crying, quite naturally he loosened my hands, and I ran\r\n into the adjoining room where I could give free vent to my grief and\r\n to my tears. Then drying my eyes I returned, and as soon as he saw me\r\n he called me to him and asked what Pico della Mirandola was doing. I\r\n replied that Pico had remained in town fearing to molest him with his\r\n presence. “And I,” said Lorenzo, “but for the fear that the journey\r\n here might be irksome to him would be most glad to see him and speak\r\n to him for the last time before I leave you all.” I asked if I should\r\n send for him. “Certainly, and with all speed,” answered he. This I\r\n did, and Pico came and sat by the bed, whilst I leaned against his\r\n knees in order to hear the languid voice of my lord for the last time.\r\n With what goodness, with what courtesy, I may say with what caresses,\r\n Lorenzo received him. First he asked his pardon for thus disturbing\r\n him, begging him to regard it as a sign of the friendship--the\r\n love--he bore him, assuring him that he died more willingly after\r\n seeing so dear a friend. Then introducing, as was his wont, pleasant\r\n and familiar sayings, he joked also with us. “I wish,” he said to\r\n Pico, “that death had spared me until your library had been complete.”\r\n Pico had hardly left the room when Fra Girolamo [Savonarola] of\r\n Ferrara, a man celebrated for his doctrine and his sanctity and an\r\n excellent preacher, came in. To his exhortations to remain firm in his\r\n faith and to live in future, if God granted him life, free from crime,\r\n or if God so willed it to receive death willingly, Lorenzo answered\r\n that he was firm in his religion, that his life would always be guided\r\n by it, and that nothing could be sweeter to him than death, if such\r\n was the divine will. Fra Girolamo then turned to go when Lorenzo said:\r\n “Oh Father, before going deign to give me thy benediction.” Bowing\r\n his head, immersed in piety and religion he repeated the words and\r\n the prayers of the friar, without paying any attention to the grief\r\n now openly shown of his attendants. It seemed that all, save Lorenzo,\r\n were going to die, so calm was he. He gave no signs of anxiety or\r\n of sorrow; even in that supreme moment he showed his usual strength\r\n of mind and his fortitude. The doctors who stood round, not to seem\r\n idle, worried him with their remedies and assistance. He submitted to\r\n everything they suggested, not because he thought it would save him,\r\n but in order not to offend any one, even in death. To the last he had\r\n such mastery over himself that he joked about his own death. Thus\r\n when given something to eat and asked how he liked it he replied: “As\r\n well as a dying man can like anything.” He embraced us all tenderly\r\n and humbly asked pardon if during his illness he had caused annoyance\r\n to any one. Then disposing himself to receive extreme unction he\r\n commended his soul to God. The Gospel containing the Passion of Christ\r\n was then read and he showed that he understood by moving his lips, or\r\n raising his languid eyes, or sometimes moving his fingers. Gazing upon\r\n a silver crucifix inlaid with precious stones and kissing it from time\r\n to time, he expired....--Fiesole, May 18, 1492.[403]\r\n\r\nThis is Poliziano’s account of the last hours of Lorenzo. The\r\nauthority for the following by Fra Pacifico Cinozzi, is Fra Silvestro,\r\nthe adherent of Savonarola who went to the stake with him, and who\r\nprofessed to have heard it from the lips of his master. To say the\r\nleast it would be unusual for a dying man who had already confessed\r\nand received the Viaticum to wish to make a second confession, and to\r\nreceive absolution from another priest. Again, had Savonarola left\r\nCareggi as described by Fra Pacifico, Lorenzo’s body would hardly\r\nhave been carried to S. Marco before the funeral and the burial in S.\r\nLorenzo.\r\n\r\n “Now it pleased God that Lorenzo fell ill, and becoming worse and\r\n nigh unto death he sent for the said Father Fra Ieronimo, using these\r\n very words: ‘Go for the Father Fra Ieronimo, for I have never found\r\n one save him who was an honest friar.’ Thus going to Careggi, where\r\n Lorenzo was, he entered and after a few words Lorenzo said he desired\r\n to make his confession. Fra Ieronimo answered he was willing, but\r\n before hearing the confession he wished to mention three things, if\r\n these were acceded to no doubt whatever his salvation was assured.\r\n Lorenzo replied he was willing and would do what was asked. The Father\r\n said: ‘Lorenzo, it is needful for you to have great faith,’ and he\r\n answered: ‘Father, that I have.’ Fra Ieronimo then added the second:\r\n ‘Also it is needful that you restore what has been wrongfully taken.’\r\n After reflecting for a while he answered: ‘Father, I will do so, or\r\n I will cause my heirs to do it if I cannot.’ The Father then said:\r\n ‘It is needful for you to give back to the Republic the liberty of\r\n the city, and to see that she returns to her ancient state.’ To these\r\n words he gave no reply. Thus the said Father departed without further\r\n confession, and not long after Lorenzo died. These words I heard from\r\n Fra Silvestro who died together with Fra Ieronimo; and I believe he\r\n knew and heard them from Father Fra Ieronimo.”[404]\r\n\r\nPopular opinion in Florence at the time certainly seems to favour\r\nPoliziano’s account. Bartolommeo Cerretani, who noted events carefully\r\nin his chronicle, wrote on April 7, 1492: “About the fifth hour\r\nLorenzo received the Sacraments.” A few days later Benedetto Dei\r\nwrote the following letter to his uncle, who was an adherent of the\r\nMedici and often went to foreign lands on their commercial business.\r\nCurious readers will find the discrepancies between the two narratives\r\ndiscussed in Creighton’s _History of the Papacy_, Villari’s _Life and\r\nTimes of Savonarola_, and Horsburgh’s _Lorenzo the Magnificent_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBartolommeo Dei _to his uncle_ Benedetto Dei, _with Machiavelli in\r\nFerrara_\r\n\r\n Dearest Uncle,--On Saturday last the 7th I wrote in answer to your\r\n letter giving you full accounts of our private affairs, of the\r\n house, and of everything, which I conclude you received. Giannotto\r\n was too busy to write, and probably will not even have time to-day,\r\n being so occupied with that business you know of; it is in danger in\r\n consequence of the sad event of which you have heard. I did not write\r\n to you before on account of the universal grief and tribulation, so\r\n that not only writing but even thinking about it was difficult. It is\r\n true that on Saturday I wrote you word that the Magnificent Lorenzo\r\n was at Careggi for change of air, not well, and in pain it was said.\r\n In the evening after my letter had gone it was reported that he had\r\n a slight fainting fit, but no one was alarmed, chiefly because of\r\n that accursed Maestro Piero Leoni of Spoleto, who to the very last\r\n insisted that he could not die of that malady. On Saturday arrived the\r\n doctor from Milan, who at once saw that he had been wrongly treated,\r\n and prepared many remedies, but it was too late. He ought to have had\r\n cold things and he was given hot. Finally on Sunday, after the fourth\r\n hour of night, according to the will of Him who rules the world, he\r\n quitted this life in the flower of his age, and most assuredly far too\r\n soon, to the great and bitter sorrow of the whole city; and with every\r\n reason, for no doubt we have lost the splendour not only of Tuscany\r\n but of all Italy. Every day we shall learn more what we have lost. As\r\n yet it cannot be calculated, but time will show.\r\n\r\n The other terrible event is the insane death of Maestro Piero Leoni,\r\n who when he saw his lying science had deceived him, which some say\r\n was allied to necromancy, went out of his mind, and was taken to the\r\n house of the Martelli near by, that is to say at S. Gervasio, where he\r\n was well treated, and passed the night full of melancholy and without\r\n speaking or answering any one. In the early morning he called for a\r\n towel and washed his face at a well, and asked a peasant how deep the\r\n water was. He was left leaning against the edge, and a short time\r\n afterwards a woman went to draw water, and found him head downwards in\r\n the well; half of his body was above water. She gave the alarm, and\r\n then was seen the miserable end of a man of such erudition who had\r\n used his science ill.\r\n\r\n This created a great stir among the people who were already much\r\n troubled by what had happened. But when it was proved that madness\r\n alone had impelled the deed accusations made by idle tongues ceased,\r\n and people said it served him right that he should have taken his own\r\n life. There was no bruise or hurt on the handsome body, and to those\r\n who saw, it was a sad spectacle. For a day it lay there by the well,\r\n and was then buried in a field like those who elect to die thus.\r\n\r\n On Monday evening at one of the clock [an hour after sundown] the body\r\n of Lorenzo was borne by the Company of the Magi into the sacristy of\r\n S. Lorenzo in the coffin wherein it had been brought from Careggi the\r\n night before, with many torches and tapers. The next day, that is\r\n Tuesday, the 10th, the funeral took place without much pomp, as had\r\n always been the custom of their ancestors, without banners. There were\r\n but three Orders of friars and one of priests; in truth, great pomp\r\n could not be shown, for the greatest splendour would have been small\r\n for such a man. But wonderful was the number of citizens and nobles,\r\n in long black robes touching the ground, who came to do him honour;\r\n it was a fine spectacle, and touching to see such manifest signs of\r\n sadness and of sorrow.\r\n\r\n The visits to Piero have been many of the whole city, and by common\r\n accord all agree in maintaining him in the position of his father.\r\n As a commencement a motion was carried by acclamation in the Council\r\n which is to be published on Monday, declaring that Piero is to be one\r\n of the Seventy in his father’s place, and is eligible for all offices,\r\n the Council of Eight, the Twelve procurators, the Accopiatori, the\r\n Operai of the Palace, and so on, which the Magnificent Lorenzo filled\r\n or might have filled, and this notwithstanding his being under age. It\r\n was a great thing and carried unanimously, and all united together to\r\n do him honour with the hope that he will be a worthy heir of all his\r\n father’s virtues.\r\n\r\n Lorenzo lived forty-three years three months and six days, having been\r\n born on January 2, 1448.[405] He died so nobly and with such patience,\r\n understanding, and reverence towards God, as the most religious man\r\n and divine soul could show; with such holy words on his lips that he\r\n seemed another S. Jerome. God be merciful to him.--Florence, April 14,\r\n 1492. Your servant,\r\n\r\n                                                   Bartolommeo Dei.[406]\r\n\r\nLorenzo was buried by the side of his brother Giuliano under the\r\nsarcophagus fashioned by Verrocchio for Cosimo and Piero in the Old\r\nSacristy of S. Lorenzo, but in 1559 the coffins were removed and\r\nplaced in a vault under the statue of the Madonna by Michelangelo in\r\nthe New Sacristy. No epitaph, not even his name, marks the spot where\r\nthe Magnificent Lorenzo lies. King Ferrante’s words when he heard of\r\nhis death were prophetic: “This man has lived long enough for his own\r\nimmortal fame, but not for Italy. God grant that now he is dead men may\r\nnot attempt that which they dared not do while he was alive.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[150] _Renaissance in Italy_, J. A. Symonds, ii. 232.

He dropped his family name\r\nand took that of Poliziano from his native town Montepulciano (Mons\r\nPolitianus). His father was murdered when he was a child of eight and\r\nhe was sent to Florence to live with an uncle, Cino di Mattei, a poor\r\nman who lived near Piazza S. Spirito in Via Saturno. Poliziano studied\r\nrhetoric under Cristofero, Landino, and Andronico, philosophy under\r\nArgyropoulos and Marsilio Ficino, in the Florentine Studio from his\r\nfifteenth to his twentieth year. Lorenzo de’ Medici, after reading\r\nhis translation of Homer, provided for his education, and he became\r\none of Lorenzo’s most intimate friends, tutor to his children and his\r\nlibrarian. Poliziano took his degree as Doctor of Law, and entering the\r\nChurch was made a Canon of the cathedral of Florence. He wrote scholia\r\nand notes to Ovid, Catullus, Statius, Suetonius, Pliny the Younger,\r\nand the _Historicæ Augustæ_; translated the History of Herodian, the\r\nManuel of Epictetus, the Aphorisms of Hippocrates, some Dialogues\r\nof Plato, and other works from Greek into Latin. His _Miscellanea_,\r\npublished in Florence in 1489, were arranged for the press at Lorenzo’s\r\nrequest. Poliziano’s Italian poetry, particularly the _Stanze per la\r\nGiostra_, or Tournament, of Giuliano de’ Medici is beautiful, and his\r\n_Sylvæ_, odes, epigrams, and other short Latin poems are celebrated.\r\nHe also wrote _Panepistemon_, a category of the various branches of\r\nknowledge, and when quite a lad the _Orfeo_, one of the earliest\r\nItalian operas. So popular was the _Orfeo_ that it was printed either\r\nseparately or with the _Stanze_ twenty times between 1494 and 1541, and\r\nthirteen times between 1541 and 1565. For the use of the common people\r\na redaction in octave stanzas was published in Florence in 1558 called\r\n_La Historia e Favola d’Orfeo alla dolce lira_. The last reprint was in\r\n1860.\r\n\r\n[162] Horses Lorenzo may have seen when he was at Naples in 1468.\r\n\r\n[163] Bernardo and Luca were brothers of Luigi Pulci.\r\n\r\n[164] Brother-in-law of Lorenzo de’ Medici.\r\n\r\n[165] _Lettere di Luigi Pulci_, op. cit. 47.\r\n\r\n[166] _Donne Medicee_, op. cit.\r\n\r\n[167] A castle and townlet belonging to the Orsini.\r\n\r\n[168] Directors of feasts. _Festaiuoli_ still go about in the villages\r\nin Tuscany to collect money for processions and church festivals.\r\n\r\n[169] _Laurentii Medicis Vita_, &c., _op. cit._ ii. 27.\r\n\r\n[170] This and the letters from the Cardinal of Pavia (pp. 167-171)\r\nrelate to Lorenzo’s desire that his brother Giuliano should be created\r\na cardinal in order to have a voice in the Consistory. What he was\r\nunable to achieve for his brother he afterwards obtained for his son\r\nGiovanni.\r\n\r\n[171] _Laurentii Medicis Vita_, op. cit. ii. 62.\r\n\r\n[172] The _catasto_ of 1427 was a register or list of all who were\r\nbound to pay taxes to the Commune of Florence. It runs: “1. Ten\r\nofficials are to be appointed to compile the register. 2. All families\r\nliable to be taxed are to be inscribed in four books; their number,\r\nages, health, capacity, and occupation. 3. All their possessions,\r\nmovable and immovable, are to be inscribed, whether within the confines\r\nof the State or abroad, monies in existence, or what is owing to them,\r\ntheir slaves and whatever belongs to them. 4. In the same way other\r\npartial _catasti_ shall be drawn up, as of peasants, universities, and\r\nguilds, foreigners and other persons not generally liable to be taxed.\r\n5. The income of each separate possession is to be noted, so that the\r\ncapital value may be ascertained, and 100 florins shall be taken as\r\nthe valuation for every 7 florins of income. 6. From such valuation\r\nshall be deducted the inherent expenses, rent of houses, of shops, the\r\nprice of horses for personal use, and 2 florins per head. 7. The net\r\nincome being thus reduced, 10 golden soldi are to be paid on every 100\r\ngolden florins, equal to the tenth part of a percentage at 5 per cent.\r\n8. On every person deducted as above, between eighteen years of age\r\nand sixty, an arbitrary tax shall be imposed, not to exceed 2 florins.\r\n9. It is left to the discretion of the officials, in case no surplus\r\nremains after the above deductions, to impose a tax to be arranged with\r\nthe persons taxed. 10. Whoso declares a false income shall have his\r\npossessions confiscated. 11. Should any contention arise the decision\r\nof the officials is final; they may not diminish the amount of the tax,\r\nsave for the repayment of a dower, until the new _catasto_, without\r\nthe approbation of the Great Council, but they may augment it. 12.\r\nThe _catasto_ is to be corrected and compiled anew every three years.\r\n13. All taxes are henceforward to be regulated by the _catasto_.”\r\n_Osservatore Fiorentino_, i. 91. Signor A. Rabbini, _Dell’ accertamento\r\ncatastale_, &c., defines the _catasto_ as at present existing as “a\r\npublic document serving as an absolutely legal and fundamental base\r\nfor the imposition of taxes on landed property and a guide in judicial\r\nor administrative procedure involving the settlement of questions\r\nregarding landed property and the rights and obligations of the owners\r\nthereof.”\r\n\r\n[173] Luca Landucci in his Diary (1450-1516) notes: “On June 18, 1472,\r\ncame a horseman with the olive branch [from Volterra] announcing the\r\ncapitulation; the people and their property to be respected. Great was\r\nthe rejoicing. But when we entered the city one of their officers,\r\na Venetian, shouted “Pillage,” and our men began to pillage and we\r\ncould not stop them or observe the articles of capitulation. The Count\r\nFederigo d’Urbino caused the Venetian and a Sienese to be hung.”\r\n_Diario Fiorentino di Luca Landucci._ Firenze, 1883.

He studied at Padua, was sent as Secretary of\r\nLegation to Constantinople by the Signoria of Venice, and afterwards\r\ntaught Greek in Venice, Bologna, Florence, &c. When Cosimo de’ Medici\r\nwas imprisoned he urged the Signoria to put him to death and poured\r\nout abominable accusations against him and his friends in the _Book\r\nof Exile_. Poggio replied, accusing Filelfo of the most heinous\r\ncrimes, and the war of words went on for years. When Cosimo returned\r\nto Florence Filelfo fled to Milan and allied himself with Albizzi\r\nand the other exiles, but soon made abject advances to Cosimo, which\r\nwere treated with silent disdain. After Cosimo’s death he sent humble\r\nletters to Lorenzo and his brother and wrote _Cosmias_, a poem in\r\npraise of the man he had abused. Lorenzo at length allowed him to\r\nreturn to Florence where he died in 1481. He was mean, arrogant, and\r\nintensely vain.\r\n\r\n[176] _Laurentii Medicis Vita_, op. cit. ii. 75.\r\n\r\n[177] Filippo de’ Medici.\r\n\r\n[178] _Laurentii Medicis Vita_, op. cit. ii. 58.\r\n\r\n[179] _Laurentii Medicis Vita_, op. cit. ii. 59.\r\n\r\n[180] The prison at Florence.\r\n\r\n[181] _Arch.

As a lad he entered the church, and\r\nsome of his first efforts in poetry are sonnets addressed to the\r\nArchbishop of Florence begging in the name of S. Peter for a cloak. He\r\nmade friends with Angelo Poliziano who probably introduced him to the\r\nMedici. Witty, clever, kind-hearted, Matteo soon became indispensable\r\nto Lorenzo, who speaks of him as “among the first and best-loved\r\ncreatures of my house.” He repaid Lorenzo’s affection tenfold by his\r\ndevotion to his daughter Maddalena, whom he accompanied to Rome when\r\nshe married Francesco Cibo. Even Lorenzo’s wife Clarice, always ill\r\nat ease among her husband’s brilliant friends and at first suspicious\r\nof Matteo’s tongue, soon discovered his many excellent qualities, and\r\nhe became her treasurer, her almoner, and at length her attorney.\r\nHe taught all Lorenzo’s children to read, and in one of his sonnets\r\nfeelingly describes the trouble they gave him. Until lately it was\r\nsupposed that Luigi Pulci and Matteo Franco were really friends, and\r\nonly wrote the ferocious and biting sonnets which amused all Florence\r\nto each other to amuse Lorenzo, but Signor Volpi proves, I think, that\r\ntheir animosity was real and that Matteo often had the best in the war\r\nof words.\r\n\r\n[188] Vermicelli.\r\n\r\n[189] _Un Cortigiano di Lorenzo il Magnifico_, G.

The Pope excommunicated Florence,\r\nas he declared out of hatred of the Medici, whose exile he demanded.\r\nThe Signoria answered by appointing twelve trusty men to be Lorenzo’s\r\nbodyguard. “Then,” writes Ammirato, “they obtained the opinion of\r\nBartolommeo Sozzino (probably what Poliziano refers to), Francesco\r\nAretino, Lancillotto Decio, Bulgarino, Andrea Panormita, Pier Filippo\r\nCornio and other masters of canon law and theology, who advised\r\nthat notwithstanding the Pope’s censures, by whom they had been\r\nexcommunicated, they, by appealing to the future Council, might cause\r\nDivine service to be celebrated in their city,” which was done.\r\n\r\n[233] This is one of several letters alluding to Clarice’s dislike of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[234] _Laurentii Medicis Vita_, &c., _op. cit._ ii. 183.\r\n\r\n[235] Matteo Franco, chaplain and devoted adherent of Lorenzo.\r\n\r\n[236] _Prose Volgari inedite_, &c., _op. cit._ p. 59.\r\n\r\n[237] _Prose Volgari inedite_, &c., _op. cit._ p. 61.\r\n\r\n[238] Ercole d’Este, Duke of Ferrara, who had been named Captain of the\r\nFlorentine troops.\r\n\r\n[239] _Laurentii Medicis Vita_, op. cit. ii. 184.\r\n\r\n[240] _Prose Volgari inedite_, op. cit. p. 64.\r\n\r\n[241] The grammar of Theodoro Gaza, a Greek, was the favourite one in\r\nthose days.\r\n\r\n[242] _Letterine d’un Bambino Fiorentino_, Nozze Bemporad-Vita.\r\nFirenze, 1887.

The Duke refused to send it to Florence but\r\nallowed Lorenzo to have it copied by a Greek scribe he sent to Ferrara.\r\nThree years later Lorenzo asked the Duke to lend for a few days the\r\ntranslation of the book by Dione Cassio (Dionysius Cassius) made for\r\nthe Duke by Niccolò Leoniceno. Again afraid to trust the manuscript out\r\nof his hands, he had a copy made in all haste by divers scribes, and\r\nsent it as a present to Lorenzo, on the condition that he was neither\r\nto lend it nor to allow it to be published. The translation was printed\r\nfor the first time in Venice in 1532, the Greek original in Paris in\r\n1548.\r\n\r\n[325] _Lettere_, &c., Arch.

The castle of Ravaldino which commanded the town still held out,\r\nand the insurgents allowed her to go to the commandant on the pretence\r\nthat she would induce him to surrender, leaving her children as\r\nhostages in their hands. Once inside the castle she defied the people,\r\nand when they threatened to kill her children replied, according to\r\nGuicciardini, “Are you not fools, cannot you see that I can have\r\nothers?” Milanese troops were sent by Lodovico Sforza and the little\r\nboys were saved.\r\n\r\n[348] _Lettere e Notizie_, &c., Arch.

During a visit to Rome in 1486 Pico della Mirandola had\r\npromulgated nine hundred theses on theology, philosophy, magic, and\r\nthe Cabbalah, which he offered to maintain in public disputation.\r\nHeresies contained in them were pointed out by his enemies and Innocent\r\nVIII. issued a Brief against those considered as dangerous. Pico fled\r\nto France and published an apology protesting his orthodoxy, but it\r\nwas only by Lorenzo’s influence that the Pope was induced to suspend\r\nproceedings. Pico then returned to Florence and Lorenzo, as this and\r\nthe two former letters show, pressed the Pope hard to grant his friend\r\na full pardon.\r\n\r\n[387] _Laurentii Medicis Vita, &c._, ii. 365 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[388] _Arch.
