Grant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\"Man proposes and God disposes.\"  There are but few important events in\r\nthe affairs of men brought about by their own choice.\r\n\r\nAlthough frequently urged by friends to write my memoirs I had\r\ndetermined never to do so, nor to write anything for publication.  At\r\nthe age of nearly sixty-two I received an injury from a fall, which\r\nconfined me closely to the house while it did not apparently affect my\r\ngeneral health. This made study a pleasant pastime.  Shortly after, the\r\nrascality of a business partner developed itself by the announcement of\r\na failure.  This was followed soon after by universal depression of all\r\nsecurities, which seemed to threaten the extinction of a good part of\r\nthe income still retained, and for which I am indebted to the kindly act\r\nof friends.  At this juncture the editor of the Century Magazine asked\r\nme to write a few articles for him. I consented for the money it gave\r\nme; for at that moment I was living upon borrowed money.  The work I\r\nfound congenial, and I determined to continue it.  The event is an\r\nimportant one for me, for good or evil; I hope for the former.\r\n\r\nIn preparing these volumes for the public, I have entered upon the task\r\nwith the sincere desire to avoid doing injustice to any one, whether on\r\nthe National or Confederate side, other than the unavoidable injustice\r\nof not making mention often where special mention is due.  There must be\r\nmany errors of omission in this work, because the subject is too large\r\nto be treated of in two volumes in such way as to do justice to all the\r\nofficers and men engaged.  There were thousands of instances, during the\r\nrebellion, of individual, company, regimental and brigade deeds of\r\nheroism which deserve special mention and are not here alluded to.  The\r\ntroops engaged in them will have to look to the detailed reports of\r\ntheir individual commanders for the full history of those deeds.\r\n\r\nThe first volume, as well as a portion of the second, was written before\r\nI had reason to suppose I was in a critical condition of health.  Later\r\nI was reduced almost to the point of death, and it became impossible for\r\nme to attend to anything for weeks.  I have, however, somewhat regained\r\nmy strength, and am able, often, to devote as many hours a day as a\r\nperson should devote to such work.  I would have more hope of satisfying\r\nthe expectation of the public if I could have allowed myself more time.\r\nI have used my best efforts, with the aid of my eldest son, F. D. Grant,\r\nassisted by his brothers, to verify from the records every statement of\r\nfact given.  The comments are my own, and show how I saw the matters\r\ntreated of whether others saw them in the same light or not.\r\n\r\nWith these remarks I present these volumes to the public, asking no\r\nfavor but hoping they will meet the approval of the reader.\r\n\r\nU.

In 1635 he\r\nmoved to what is now Windsor, Connecticut, and was the surveyor for that\r\ncolony for more than forty years.  He was also, for many years of the\r\ntime, town clerk.  He was a married man when he arrived at Dorchester,\r\nbut his children were all born in this country.  His eldest son, Samuel,\r\ntook lands on the east side of the Connecticut River, opposite Windsor,\r\nwhich have been held and occupied by descendants of his to this day.\r\n\r\nI am of the eighth generation from Mathew Grant, and seventh from\r\nSamuel.  Mathew Grant's first wife died a few years after their\r\nsettlement in Windsor, and he soon after married the widow Rockwell,\r\nwho, with her first husband, had been fellow-passengers with him and his\r\nfirst wife, on the ship Mary and John, from Dorchester, England, in\r\n1630.  Mrs. Rockwell had several children by her first marriage, and\r\nothers by her second.  By intermarriage, two or three generations later,\r\nI am descended from both the wives of Mathew Grant.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth descending generation my great grandfather, Noah Grant, and\r\nhis younger brother, Solomon, held commissions in the English army, in\r\n1756, in the war against the French and Indians.  Both were killed that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather, also named Noah, was then but nine years old. At the\r\nbreaking out of the war of the Revolution, after the battles of Concord\r\nand Lexington, he went with a Connecticut company to join the\r\nContinental army, and was present at the battle of Bunker Hill.  He\r\nserved until the fall of Yorktown, or through the entire Revolutionary\r\nwar.  He must, however, have been on furlough part of the time--as I\r\nbelieve most of the soldiers of that period were--for he married in\r\nConnecticut during the war, had two children, and was a widower at the\r\nclose.  Soon after this he emigrated to Westmoreland County,\r\nPennsylvania, and settled near the town of Greensburg in that county.\r\nHe took with him the younger of his two children, Peter Grant.  The\r\nelder, Solomon, remained with his relatives in Connecticut until old\r\nenough to do for himself, when he emigrated to the British West Indies.\r\n\r\nNot long after his settlement in Pennsylvania, my grandfather, Captain\r\nNoah Grant, married a Miss Kelly, and in 1799 he emigrated again, this\r\ntime to Ohio, and settled where the town of Deerfield now stands.  He\r\nhad now five children, including Peter, a son by his first marriage.  My\r\nfather, Jesse R. Grant, was the second child--oldest son, by the second\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nPeter Grant went early to Maysville, Kentucky, where he was very\r\nprosperous, married, had a family of nine children, and was drowned at\r\nthe mouth of the Kanawha River, Virginia, in 1825, being at the time one\r\nof the wealthy men of the West.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother Grant died in 1805, leaving seven children.  This broke\r\nup the family.  Captain Noah Grant was not thrifty in the way of \"laying\r\nup stores on earth,\" and, after the death of his second wife, he went,\r\nwith the two youngest children, to live with his son Peter, in\r\nMaysville.  The rest of the family found homes in the neighborhood of\r\nDeerfield, my father in the family of judge Tod, the father of the late\r\nGovernor Tod, of Ohio.  His industry and independence of character were\r\nsuch, that I imagine his labor compensated fully for the expense of his\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nThere must have been a cordiality in his welcome into the Tod family,\r\nfor to the day of his death he looked upon judge Tod and his wife, with\r\nall the reverence he could have felt if they had been parents instead of\r\nbenefactors.  I have often heard him speak of Mrs. Tod as the most\r\nadmirable woman he had ever known.  He remained with the Tod family only\r\na few years, until old enough to learn a trade.  He went first, I\r\nbelieve, with his half-brother, Peter Grant, who, though not a tanner\r\nhimself, owned a tannery in Maysville, Kentucky.  Here he learned his\r\ntrade, and in a few years returned to Deerfield and worked for, and\r\nlived in the family of a Mr. Brown, the father of John Brown--\"whose\r\nbody lies mouldering in the grave, while his soul goes marching on.\"  I\r\nhave often heard my father speak of John Brown, particularly since the\r\nevents at Harper's Ferry.  Brown was a boy when they lived in the same\r\nhouse, but he knew him afterwards, and regarded him as a man of great\r\npurity of character, of high moral and physical courage, but a fanatic\r\nand extremist in whatever he advocated.  It was certainly the act of an\r\ninsane man to attempt the invasion of the South, and the overthrow of\r\nslavery, with less than twenty men.\r\n\r\nMy father set up for himself in business, establishing a tannery at\r\nRavenna, the county seat of Portage County.  In a few years he removed\r\nfrom Ravenna, and set up the same business at Point Pleasant, Clermont\r\nCounty, Ohio.\r\n\r\nDuring the minority of my father, the West afforded but poor facilities\r\nfor the most opulent of the youth to acquire an education, and the\r\nmajority were dependent, almost exclusively, upon their own exertions\r\nfor whatever learning they obtained.  I have often heard him say that\r\nhis time at school was limited to six months, when he was very young,\r\ntoo young, indeed, to learn much, or to appreciate the advantages of an\r\neducation, and to a \"quarter's schooling\" afterwards, probably while\r\nliving with judge Tod.  But his thirst for education was intense.  He\r\nlearned rapidly, and was a constant reader up to the day of his death in\r\nhis eightieth year.  Books were scarce in the Western Reserve during his\r\nyouth, but he read every book he could borrow in the neighborhood where\r\nhe lived.  This scarcity gave him the early habit of studying everything\r\nhe read, so that when he got through with a book, he knew everything in\r\nit.  The habit continued through life.  Even after reading the daily\r\npapers--which he never neglected--he could give all the important\r\ninformation they contained.  He made himself an excellent English\r\nscholar, and before he was twenty years of age was a constant\r\ncontributor to Western newspapers, and was also, from that time until he\r\nwas fifty years old, an able debater in the societies for this purpose,\r\nwhich were common in the West at that time.  He always took an active\r\npart in politics, but was never a candidate for office, except, I\r\nbelieve, that he was the first Mayor of Georgetown.  He supported\r\nJackson for the Presidency; but he was a Whig, a great admirer of Henry\r\nClay, and never voted for any other democrat for high office after\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nMy mother's family lived in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, for several\r\ngenerations.  I have little information about her ancestors.  Her family\r\ntook no interest in genealogy, so that my grandfather, who died when I\r\nwas sixteen years old, knew only back to his grandfather.  On the other\r\nside, my father took a great interest in the subject, and in his\r\nresearches, he found that there was an entailed estate in Windsor,\r\nConnecticut, belonging to the family, to which his nephew, Lawson Grant\r\n--still living--was the heir.  He was so much interested in the subject\r\nthat he got his nephew to empower him to act in the matter, and in 1832\r\nor 1833, when I was a boy ten or eleven years old, he went to Windsor,\r\nproved the title beyond dispute, and perfected the claim of the owners\r\nfor a consideration--three thousand dollars, I think.  I remember the\r\ncircumstance well, and remember, too, hearing him say on his return that\r\nhe found some widows living on the property, who had little or nothing\r\nbeyond their homes.  From these he refused to receive any recompense.\r\n\r\nMy mother's father, John Simpson, moved from Montgomery County,\r\nPennsylvania, to Clermont County, Ohio, about the year 1819, taking with\r\nhim his four children, three daughters and one son.  My mother, Hannah\r\nSimpson, was the third of these children, and was then over twenty years\r\nof age.  Her oldest sister was at that time married, and had several\r\nchildren.  She still lives in Clermont County at this writing, October\r\n5th, 1884, and is over ninety years of age.  Until her memory failed her,\r\na few years ago, she thought the country ruined beyond recovery when the\r\nDemocratic party lost control in 1860.  Her family, which was large,\r\ninherited her views, with the exception of one son who settled in\r\nKentucky before the war.  He was the only one of the children who\r\nentered the volunteer service to suppress the rebellion.\r\n\r\nHer brother, next of age and now past eighty-eight, is also still living\r\nin Clermont County, within a few miles of the old homestead, and is as\r\nactive in mind as ever.  He was a supporter of the Government during the\r\nwar, and remains a firm believer, that national success by the\r\nDemocratic party means irretrievable ruin.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1821, my father, Jesse R. Grant, married Hannah Simpson.  I was\r\nborn on the 27th of April, 1822, at Point Pleasant, Clermont County,\r\nOhio.  In the fall of 1823 we moved to Georgetown, the county seat of\r\nBrown, the adjoining county east.  This place remained my home, until at\r\nthe age of seventeen, in 1839, I went to West Point.\r\n\r\nThe schools, at the time of which I write, were very indifferent.  There\r\nwere no free schools, and none in which the scholars were classified.\r\nThey were all supported by subscription, and a single teacher--who was\r\noften a man or a woman incapable of teaching much, even if they imparted\r\nall they knew--would have thirty or forty scholars, male and female,\r\nfrom the infant learning the A B C's up to the young lady of eighteen\r\nand the boy of twenty, studying the highest branches taught--the three\r\nR's, \"Reading, 'Riting, 'Rithmetic.\"  I never saw an algebra, or other\r\nmathematical work higher than the arithmetic, in Georgetown, until after\r\nI was appointed to West Point.  I then bought a work on algebra in\r\nCincinnati; but having no teacher it was Greek to me.\r\n\r\nMy life in Georgetown was uneventful.  From the age of five or six until\r\nseventeen, I attended the subscription schools of the village, except\r\nduring the winters of 1836-7 and 1838-9.  The former period was spent in\r\nMaysville, Kentucky, attending the school of Richardson and Rand; the\r\nlatter in Ripley, Ohio, at a private school.  I was not studious in\r\nhabit, and probably did not make progress enough to compensate for the\r\noutlay for board and tuition.  At all events both winters were spent in\r\ngoing over the same old arithmetic which I knew every word of before,\r\nand repeating:  \"A noun is the name of a thing,\" which I had also heard\r\nmy Georgetown teachers repeat, until I had come to believe it--but I\r\ncast no reflections upon my old teacher, Richardson. He turned out\r\nbright scholars from his school, many of whom have filled conspicuous\r\nplaces in the service of their States.  Two of my contemporaries there\r\n--who, I believe, never attended any other institution of learning--have\r\nheld seats in Congress, and one, if not both, other high offices; these\r\nare Wadsworth and Brewster.\r\n\r\nMy father was, from my earliest recollection, in comfortable\r\ncircumstances, considering the times, his place of residence, and the\r\ncommunity in which he lived.  Mindful of his own lack of facilities for\r\nacquiring an education, his greatest desire in maturer years was for the\r\neducation of his children. Consequently, as stated before, I never\r\nmissed a quarter from school from the time I was old enough to attend\r\ntill the time of leaving home.  This did not exempt me from labor.  In\r\nmy early days, every one labored more or less, in the region where my\r\nyouth was spent, and more in proportion to their private means.  It was\r\nonly the very poor who were exempt.  While my father carried on the\r\nmanufacture of leather and worked at the trade himself, he owned and\r\ntilled considerable land.  I detested the trade, preferring almost any\r\nother labor; but I was fond of agriculture, and of all employment in\r\nwhich horses were used.  We had, among other lands, fifty acres of\r\nforest within a mile of the village.  In the fall of the year choppers\r\nwere employed to cut enough wood to last a twelve-month.  When I was\r\nseven or eight years of age, I began hauling all the wood used in the\r\nhouse and shops.  I could not load it on the wagons, of course, at that\r\ntime, but I could drive, and the choppers would load, and some one at\r\nthe house unload.  When about eleven years old, I was strong enough to\r\nhold a plough.  From that age until seventeen I did all the work done\r\nwith horses, such as breaking up the land, furrowing, ploughing corn and\r\npotatoes, bringing in the crops when harvested, hauling all the wood,\r\nbesides tending two or three horses, a cow or two, and sawing wood for\r\nstoves, etc., while still attending school.  For this I was compensated\r\nby the fact that there was never any scolding or punishing by my\r\nparents; no objection to rational enjoyments, such as fishing, going to\r\nthe creek a mile away to swim in summer, taking a horse and visiting my\r\ngrandparents in the adjoining county, fifteen miles off, skating on the\r\nice in winter, or taking a horse and sleigh when there was snow on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWhile still quite young I had visited Cincinnati, forty-five miles away,\r\nseveral times, alone; also Maysville, Kentucky, often, and once\r\nLouisville.  The journey to Louisville was a big one for a boy of that\r\nday.  I had also gone once with a two-horse carriage to Chilicothe,\r\nabout seventy miles, with a neighbor's family, who were removing to\r\nToledo, Ohio, and returned alone; and had gone once, in like manner, to\r\nFlat Rock, Kentucky, about seventy miles away.  On this latter occasion\r\nI was fifteen years of age.  While at Flat Rock, at the house of a Mr.\r\nPayne, whom I was visiting with his brother, a neighbor of ours in\r\nGeorgetown, I saw a very fine saddle horse, which I rather coveted, and\r\nproposed to Mr. Payne, the owner, to trade him for one of the two I was\r\ndriving.  Payne hesitated to trade with a boy, but asking his brother\r\nabout it, the latter told him that it would be all right, that I was\r\nallowed to do as I pleased with the horses.  I was seventy miles from\r\nhome, with a carriage to take back, and Mr. Payne said he did not know\r\nthat his horse had ever had a collar on.  I asked to have him hitched to\r\na farm wagon and we would soon see whether he would work.  It was soon\r\nevident that the horse had never worn harness before; but he showed no\r\nviciousness, and I expressed a confidence that I could manage him.  A\r\ntrade was at once struck, I receiving ten dollars difference.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Payne, of Georgetown, and I started on our return.  We\r\ngot along very well for a few miles, when we encountered a ferocious dog\r\nthat frightened the horses and made them run.  The new animal kicked at\r\nevery jump he made.  I got the horses stopped, however, before any\r\ndamage was done, and without running into anything.  After giving them a\r\nlittle rest, to quiet their fears, we started again.  That instant the\r\nnew horse kicked, and started to run once more.  The road we were on,\r\nstruck the turnpike within half a mile of the point where the second\r\nrunaway commenced, and there there was an embankment twenty or more feet\r\ndeep on the opposite side of the pike.  I got the horses stopped on the\r\nvery brink of the precipice.  My new horse was terribly frightened and\r\ntrembled like an aspen; but he was not half so badly frightened as my\r\ncompanion, Mr. Payne, who deserted me after this last experience, and\r\ntook passage on a freight wagon for Maysville.  Every time I attempted\r\nto start, my new horse would commence to kick.  I was in quite a dilemma\r\nfor a time.  Once in Maysville I could borrow a horse from an uncle who\r\nlived there; but I was more than a day's travel from that point.\r\nFinally I took out my bandanna--the style of handkerchief in universal\r\nuse then--and with this blindfolded my horse.  In this way I reached\r\nMaysville safely the next day, no doubt much to the surprise of my\r\nfriend.  Here I borrowed a horse from my uncle, and the following day we\r\nproceeded on our journey.\r\n\r\nAbout half my school-days in Georgetown were spent at the school of John\r\nD. White, a North Carolinian, and the father of Chilton White who\r\nrepresented the district in Congress for one term during the rebellion.\r\nMr. White was always a Democrat in politics, and Chilton followed his\r\nfather.  He had two older brothers--all three being school-mates of mine\r\nat their father's school--who did not go the same way.  The second\r\nbrother died before the rebellion began; he was a Whig, and afterwards a\r\nRepublican.  His oldest brother was a Republican and brave soldier\r\nduring the rebellion.  Chilton is reported as having told of an earlier\r\nhorse-trade of mine.  As he told the story, there was a Mr. Ralston\r\nliving within a few miles of the village, who owned a colt which I very\r\nmuch wanted.  My father had offered twenty dollars for it, but Ralston\r\nwanted twenty-five.  I was so anxious to have the colt, that after the\r\nowner left, I begged to be allowed to take him at the price demanded.\r\nMy father yielded, but said twenty dollars was all the horse was worth,\r\nand told me to offer that price; if it was not accepted I was to offer\r\ntwenty-two and a half, and if that would not get him, to give the\r\ntwenty-five.  I at once mounted a horse and went for the colt.  When I\r\ngot to Mr. Ralston's house, I said to him:  \"Papa says I may offer you\r\ntwenty dollars for the colt, but if you won't take that, I am to offer\r\ntwenty-two and a half, and if you won't take that, to give you\r\ntwenty-five.\"  It would not require a Connecticut man to guess the price\r\nfinally agreed upon.  This story is nearly true.  I certainly showed\r\nvery plainly that I had come for the colt and meant to have him.  I\r\ncould not have been over eight years old at the time.  This transaction\r\ncaused me great heart-burning. The story got out among the boys of the\r\nvillage, and it was a long time before I heard the last of it.  Boys\r\nenjoy the misery of their companions, at least village boys in that day\r\ndid, and in later life I have found that all adults are not free from\r\nthe peculiarity.  I kept the horse until he was four years old, when he\r\nwent blind, and I sold him for twenty dollars.  When I went to Maysville\r\nto school, in 1836, at the age of fourteen, I recognized my colt as one\r\nof the blind horses working on the tread-wheel of the ferry-boat.\r\n\r\nI have describes enough of my early life to give an impression of the\r\nwhole.  I did not like to work; but I did as much of it, while young, as\r\ngrown men can be hired to do in these days, and attended school at the\r\nsame time.  I had as many privileges as any boy in the village, and\r\nprobably more than most of them.  I have no recollection of ever having\r\nbeen punished at home, either by scolding or by the rod.  But at school\r\nthe case was different.  The rod was freely used there, and I was not\r\nexempt from its influence.  I can see John D. White--the school teacher\r\n--now, with his long beech switch always in his hand.  It was not always\r\nthe same one, either.  Switches were brought in bundles, from a beech\r\nwood near the school house, by the boys for whose benefit they were\r\nintended.  Often a whole bundle would be used up in a single day.  I\r\nnever had any hard feelings against my teacher, either while attending\r\nthe school, or in later years when reflecting upon my experience.  Mr.\r\nWhite was a kindhearted man, and was much respected by the community in\r\nwhich he lived.  He only followed the universal custom of the period,\r\nand that under which he had received his own education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWEST POINT--GRADUATION.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1838-9 I was attending school at Ripley, only ten miles\r\ndistant from Georgetown, but spent the Christmas holidays at home.\r\nDuring this vacation my father received a letter from the Honorable\r\nThomas Morris, then United States Senator from Ohio.  When he read it he\r\nsaid to me, \"Ulysses, I believe you are going to receive the\r\nappointment.\"  \"What appointment?\"  I inquired.  \"To West Point; I have\r\napplied for it.\"  \"But I won't go,\" I said.  He said he thought I would,\r\nAND I THOUGHT SO TOO, IF HE DID.  I really had no objection to going to\r\nWest Point, except that I had a very exalted idea of the acquirements\r\nnecessary to get through.  I did not believe I possessed them, and could\r\nnot bear the idea of failing.  There had been four boys from our\r\nvillage, or its immediate neighborhood, who had been graduated from West\r\nPoint, and never a failure of any one appointed from Georgetown, except\r\nin the case of the one whose place I was to take.  He was the son of Dr.\r\nBailey, our nearest and most intimate neighbor.  Young Bailey had been\r\nappointed in 1837.  Finding before the January examination following,\r\nthat he could not pass, he resigned and went to a private school, and\r\nremained there until the following year, when he was reappointed.\r\nBefore the next examination he was dismissed.  Dr. Bailey was a proud\r\nand sensitive man, and felt the failure of his son so keenly that he\r\nforbade his return home.  There were no telegraphs in those days to\r\ndisseminate news rapidly, no railroads west of the Alleghanies, and but\r\nfew east; and above all, there were no reporters prying into other\r\npeople's private affairs.  Consequently it did not become generally\r\nknown that there was a vacancy at West Point from our district until I\r\nwas appointed.  I presume Mrs. Bailey confided to my mother the fact\r\nthat Bartlett had been dismissed, and that the doctor had forbidden his\r\nson's return home.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Thomas L. Hamer, one of the ablest men Ohio ever produced,\r\nwas our member of Congress at the time, and had the right of nomination.\r\nHe and my father had been members of the same debating society (where\r\nthey were generally pitted on opposite sides), and intimate personal\r\nfriends from their early manhood up to a few years before.  In politics\r\nthey differed. Hamer was a life-long Democrat, while my father was a\r\nWhig. They had a warm discussion, which finally became angry--over some\r\nact of President Jackson, the removal of the deposit of public moneys, I\r\nthink--after which they never spoke until after my appointment.  I know\r\nboth of them felt badly over this estrangement, and would have been glad\r\nat any time to come to a reconciliation; but neither would make the\r\nadvance.  Under these circumstances my father would not write to Hamer\r\nfor the appointment, but he wrote to Thomas Morris, United States\r\nSenator from Ohio, informing him that there was a vacancy at West Point\r\nfrom our district, and that he would be glad if I could be appointed to\r\nfill it.  This letter, I presume, was turned over to Mr. Hamer, and, as\r\nthere was no other applicant, he cheerfully appointed me.  This healed\r\nthe breach between the two, never after reopened.\r\n\r\nBesides the argument used by my father in favor of my going to West\r\nPoint--that \"he thought I would go\"--there was another very strong\r\ninducement.  I had always a great desire to travel.  I was already the\r\nbest travelled boy in Georgetown, except the sons of one man, John\r\nWalker, who had emigrated to Texas with his family, and immigrated back\r\nas soon as he could get the means to do so.  In his short stay in Texas\r\nhe acquired a very different opinion of the country from what one would\r\nform going there now.\r\n\r\nI had been east to Wheeling, Virginia, and north to the Western Reserve,\r\nin Ohio, west to Louisville, and south to Bourbon County, Kentucky,\r\nbesides having driven or ridden pretty much over the whole country\r\nwithin fifty miles of home.  Going to West Point would give me the\r\nopportunity of visiting the two great cities of the continent,\r\nPhiladelphia and New York.  This was enough.  When these places were\r\nvisited I would have been glad to have had a steamboat or railroad\r\ncollision, or any other accident happen, by which I might have received\r\na temporary injury sufficient to make me ineligible, for a time, to\r\nenter the Academy.  Nothing of the kind occurred, and I had to face the\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nGeorgetown has a remarkable record for a western village.  It is, and\r\nhas been from its earliest existence, a democratic town.  There was\r\nprobably no time during the rebellion when, if the opportunity could\r\nhave been afforded, it would not have voted for Jefferson Davis for\r\nPresident of the United States, over Mr. Lincoln, or any other\r\nrepresentative of his party; unless it was immediately after some of\r\nJohn Morgan's men, in his celebrated raid through Ohio, spent a few\r\nhours in the village.  The rebels helped themselves to whatever they\r\ncould find, horses, boots and shoes, especially horses, and many ordered\r\nmeals to be prepared for them by the families.  This was no doubt a far\r\npleasanter duty for some families than it would have been to render a\r\nlike service for Union soldiers.  The line between the Rebel and Union\r\nelement in Georgetown was so marked that it led to divisions even in the\r\nchurches.  There were churches in that part of Ohio where treason was\r\npreached regularly, and where, to secure membership, hostility to the\r\ngovernment, to the war and to the liberation of the slaves, was far more\r\nessential than a belief in the authenticity or credibility of the Bible.\r\nThere were men in Georgetown who filled all the requirements for\r\nmembership in these churches.\r\n\r\nYet this far-off western village, with a population, including old and\r\nyoung, male and female, of about one thousand--about enough for the\r\norganization of a single regiment if all had been men capable of bearing\r\narms--furnished the Union army four general officers and one colonel,\r\nWest Point graduates, and nine generals and field officers of\r\nVolunteers, that I can think of. Of the graduates from West Point, all\r\nhad citizenship elsewhere at the breaking out of the rebellion, except\r\npossibly General A. V. Kautz, who had remained in the army from his\r\ngraduation.  Two of the colonels also entered the service from other\r\nlocalities.  The other seven, General McGroierty, Colonels White, Fyffe,\r\nLoudon and Marshall, Majors King and Bailey, were all residents of\r\nGeorgetown when the war broke out, and all of them, who were alive at\r\nthe close, returned there.  Major Bailey was the cadet who had preceded\r\nme at West Point.  He was killed in West Virginia, in his first\r\nengagement.  As far as I know, every boy who has entered West Point from\r\nthat village since my time has been graduated.\r\n\r\nI took passage on a steamer at Ripley, Ohio, for Pittsburg, about the\r\nmiddle of May, 1839.  Western boats at that day did not make regular\r\ntrips at stated times, but would stop anywhere, and for any length of\r\ntime, for passengers or freight.  I have myself been detained two or\r\nthree days at a place after steam was up, the gang planks, all but one,\r\ndrawn in, and after the time advertised for starting had expired.  On\r\nthis occasion we had no vexatious delays, and in about three days\r\nPittsburg was reached.  From Pittsburg I chose passage by the canal to\r\nHarrisburg, rather than by the more expeditious stage.  This gave a\r\nbetter opportunity of enjoying the fine scenery of Western Pennsylvania,\r\nand I had rather a dread of reaching my destination at all.  At that\r\ntime the canal was much patronized by travellers, and, with the\r\ncomfortable packets of the period, no mode of conveyance could be more\r\npleasant, when time was not an object.  From Harrisburg to Philadelphia\r\nthere was a railroad, the first I had ever seen, except the one on which\r\nI had just crossed the summit of the Alleghany Mountains, and over which\r\ncanal boats were transported.  In travelling by the road from\r\nHarrisburg, I thought the perfection of rapid transit had been reached.\r\nWe travelled at least eighteen miles an hour, when at full speed, and\r\nmade the whole distance averaging probably as much as twelve miles an\r\nhour.  This seemed like annihilating space.  I stopped five days in\r\nPhiladelphia, saw about every street in the city, attended the theatre,\r\nvisited Girard College (which was then in course of construction), and\r\ngot reprimanded from home afterwards, for dallying by the way so long.\r\nMy sojourn in New York was shorter, but long enough to enable me to see\r\nthe city very well.  I reported at West Point on the 30th or 31st of\r\nMay, and about two weeks later passed my examination for admission,\r\nwithout difficulty, very much to my surprise.\r\n\r\nA military life had no charms for me, and I had not the faintest idea of\r\nstaying in the army even if I should be graduated, which I did not\r\nexpect.  The encampment which preceded the commencement of academic\r\nstudies was very wearisome and uninteresting.  When the 28th of August\r\ncame--the date for breaking up camp and going into barracks--I felt as\r\nthough I had been at West Point always, and that if I staid to\r\ngraduation, I would have to remain always.  I did not take hold of my\r\nstudies with avidity, in fact I rarely ever read over a lesson the\r\nsecond time during my entire cadetship.  I could not sit in my room\r\ndoing nothing.  There is a fine library connected with the Academy from\r\nwhich cadets can get books to read in their quarters.  I devoted more\r\ntime to these, than to books relating to the course of studies.  Much of\r\nthe time, I am sorry to say, was devoted to novels, but not those of a\r\ntrashy sort.  I read all of Bulwer's then published, Cooper's,\r\nMarryat's, Scott's, Washington Irving's works, Lever's, and many others\r\nthat I do not now remember.  Mathematics was very easy to me, so that\r\nwhen January came, I passed the examination, taking a good standing in\r\nthat branch.  In French, the only other study at that time in the first\r\nyear's course, my standing was very low.  In fact, if the class had been\r\nturned the other end foremost I should have been near head.  I never\r\nsucceeded in getting squarely at either end of my class, in any one\r\nstudy, during the four years.  I came near it in French, artillery,\r\ninfantry and cavalry tactics, and conduct.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session of the Congress which met in December, 1839, a bill\r\nwas discussed abolishing the Military Academy.  I saw in this an\r\nhonorable way to obtain a discharge, and read the debates with much\r\ninterest, but with impatience at the delay in taking action, for I was\r\nselfish enough to favor the bill.  It never passed, and a year later,\r\nalthough the time hung drearily with me, I would have been sorry to have\r\nseen it succeed.  My idea then was to get through the course, secure a\r\ndetail for a few years as assistant professor of mathematics at the\r\nAcademy, and afterwards obtain a permanent position as professor in some\r\nrespectable college; but circumstances always did shape my course\r\ndifferent from my plans.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two years the class received the usual furlough, extending\r\nfrom the close of the June examination to the 28th of August.  This I\r\nenjoyed beyond any other period of my life.  My father had sold out his\r\nbusiness in Georgetown--where my youth had been spent, and to which my\r\nday-dreams carried me back as my future home, if I should ever be able\r\nto retire on a competency.  He had moved to Bethel, only twelve miles\r\naway, in the adjoining county of Clermont, and had bought a young horse\r\nthat had never been in harness, for my special use under the saddle\r\nduring my furlough.  Most of my time was spent among my old\r\nschool-mates--these ten weeks were shorter than one week at West Point.\r\n\r\nPersons acquainted with the Academy know that the corps of cadets is\r\ndivided into four companies for the purpose of military exercises.\r\nThese companies are officered from the cadets, the superintendent and\r\ncommandant selecting the officers for their military bearing and\r\nqualifications.  The adjutant, quartermaster, four captains and twelve\r\nlieutenants are taken from the first, or Senior class; the sergeants\r\nfrom the second, or junior class; and the corporals from the third, or\r\nSophomore class.  I had not been \"called out\" as a corporal, but when I\r\nreturned from furlough I found myself the last but one--about my\r\nstanding in all the tactics--of eighteen sergeants.  The promotion was\r\ntoo much for me.  That year my standing in the class--as shown by the\r\nnumber of demerits of the year--was about the same as it was among the\r\nsergeants, and I was dropped, and served the fourth year as a private.\r\n\r\nDuring my first year's encampment General Scott visited West Point, and\r\nreviewed the cadets.  With his commanding figure, his quite colossal\r\nsize and showy uniform, I thought him the finest specimen of manhood my\r\neyes had ever beheld, and the most to be envied.  I could never resemble\r\nhim in appearance, but I believe I did have a presentiment for a moment\r\nthat some day I should occupy his place on review--although I had no\r\nintention then of remaining in the army.  My experience in a horse-trade\r\nten years before, and the ridicule it caused me, were too fresh in my\r\nmind for me to communicate this presentiment to even my most intimate\r\nchum.  The next summer Martin Van Buren, then President of the United\r\nStates, visited West Point and reviewed the cadets; he did not impress\r\nme with the awe which Scott had inspired.  In fact I regarded General\r\nScott and Captain C. F. Smith, the Commandant of Cadets, as the two men\r\nmost to be envied in the nation.  I retained a high regard for both up\r\nto the day of their death.\r\n\r\nThe last two years wore away more rapidly than the first two, but they\r\nstill seemed about five times as long as Ohio years, to me.  At last all\r\nthe examinations were passed, and the members of the class were called\r\nupon to record their choice of arms of service and regiments.  I was\r\nanxious to enter the cavalry, or dragoons as they were then called, but\r\nthere was only one regiment of dragoons in the Army at that time, and\r\nattached to that, besides the full complement of officers, there were at\r\nleast four brevet second lieutenants.  I recorded therefore my first\r\nchoice, dragoons; second, 4th infantry; and got the latter.  Again there\r\nwas a furlough--or, more properly speaking, leave of absence for the\r\nclass were now commissioned officers--this time to the end of September.\r\nAgain I went to Ohio to spend my vacation among my old school-mates; and\r\nagain I found a fine saddle horse purchased for my special use, besides\r\na horse and buggy that I could drive--but I was not in a physical\r\ncondition to enjoy myself quite as well as on the former occasion.  For\r\nsix months before graduation I had had a desperate cough (\"Tyler's grip\"\r\nit was called), and I was very much reduced, weighing but one hundred\r\nand seventeen pounds, just my weight at entrance, though I had grown six\r\ninches in stature in the mean time.  There was consumption in my\r\nfather's family, two of his brothers having died of that disease, which\r\nmade my symptoms more alarming.  The brother and sister next younger\r\nthan myself died, during the rebellion, of the same disease, and I\r\nseemed the most promising subject for it of the three in 1843.\r\n\r\nHaving made alternate choice of two different arms of service with\r\ndifferent uniforms, I could not get a uniform suit until notified of my\r\nassignment.  I left my measurement with a tailor, with directions not to\r\nmake the uniform until I notified him whether it was to be for infantry\r\nor dragoons.  Notice did not reach me for several weeks, and then it\r\ntook at least a week to get the letter of instructions to the tailor and\r\ntwo more to make the clothes and have them sent to me.  This was a time\r\nof great suspense.  I was impatient to get on my uniform and see how it\r\nlooked, and probably wanted my old school-mates, particularly the girls,\r\nto see me in it.\r\n\r\nThe conceit was knocked out of me by two little circumstances that\r\nhappened soon after the arrival of the clothes, which gave me a distaste\r\nfor military uniform that I never recovered from.  Soon after the\r\narrival of the suit I donned it, and put off for Cincinnati on\r\nhorseback.  While I was riding along a street of that city, imagining\r\nthat every one was looking at me, with a feeling akin to mine when I\r\nfirst saw General Scott, a little urchin, bareheaded, footed, with dirty\r\nand ragged pants held up by bare a single gallows--that's what\r\nsuspenders were called then--and a shirt that had not seen a wash-tub\r\nfor weeks, turned to me and cried:  \"Soldier! will you work?  No,\r\nsir--ee; I'll sell my shirt first!!\" The horse trade and its dire\r\nconsequences were recalled to mind.\r\n\r\nThe other circumstance occurred at home.  Opposite our house in Bethel\r\nstood the old stage tavern where \"man and beast\" found accommodation,\r\nThe stable-man was rather dissipated, but possessed of some humor.  On\r\nmy return I found him parading the streets, and attending in the stable,\r\nbarefooted, but in a pair of sky-blue nankeen pantaloons--just the color\r\nof my uniform trousers--with a strip of white cotton sheeting sewed down\r\nthe outside seams in imitation of mine.  The joke was a huge one in the\r\nmind of many of the people, and was much enjoyed by them; but I did not\r\nappreciate it so highly.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of my leave of absence, my time was spent in\r\nvisiting friends in Georgetown and Cincinnati, and occasionally other\r\ntowns in that part of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nARMY LIFE--CAUSES OF THE MEXICAN WAR--CAMP SALUBRITY.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of September I reported for duty at Jefferson Barracks, St.\r\nLouis, with the 4th United States infantry.  It was the largest military\r\npost in the country at that time, being garrisoned by sixteen companies\r\nof infantry, eight of the 3d regiment, the remainder of the 4th.\r\nColonel Steven Kearney, one of the ablest officers of the day, commanded\r\nthe post, and under him discipline was kept at a high standard, but\r\nwithout vexatious rules or regulations.  Every drill and roll-call had\r\nto be attended, but in the intervals officers were permitted to enjoy\r\nthemselves, leaving the garrison, and going where they pleased, without\r\nmaking written application to state where they were going for how long,\r\netc., so that they were back for their next duty.  It did seem to me, in\r\nmy early army days, that too many of the older officers, when they came\r\nto command posts, made it a study to think what orders they could\r\npublish to annoy their subordinates and render them uncomfortable.  I\r\nnoticed, however, a few years later, when the Mexican war broke out,\r\nthat most of this class of officers discovered they were possessed of\r\ndisabilities which entirely incapacitated them for active field service.\r\nThey had the moral courage to proclaim it, too.  They were right; but\r\nthey did not always give their disease the right name.\r\n\r\nAt West Point I had a class-mate--in the last year of our studies he was\r\nroom-mate also--F. T. Dent, whose family resided some five miles west of\r\nJefferson Barracks.  Two of his unmarried brothers were living at home\r\nat that time, and as I had taken with me from Ohio, my horse, saddle and\r\nbridle, I soon found my way out to White Haven, the name of the Dent\r\nestate.  As I found the family congenial my visits became frequent.\r\nThere were at home, besides the young men, two daughters, one a school\r\nmiss of fifteen, the other a girl of eight or nine.  There was still an\r\nolder daughter of seventeen, who had been spending several years at\r\nboarding-school in St. Louis, but who, though through school, had not\r\nyet returned home.  She was spending the winter in the city with\r\nconnections, the family of Colonel John O'Fallon, well known in St.\r\nLouis.  In February she returned to her country home.  After that I do\r\nnot know but my visits became more frequent; they certainly did become\r\nmore enjoyable.  We would often take walks, or go on horseback to visit\r\nthe neighbors, until I became quite well acquainted in that vicinity.\r\nSometimes one of the brothers would accompany us, sometimes one of the\r\nyounger sisters.  If the 4th infantry had remained at Jefferson Barracks\r\nit is possible, even probable, that this life might have continued for\r\nsome years without my finding out that there was anything serious the\r\nmatter with me; but in the following May a circumstance occurred which\r\ndeveloped my sentiment so palpably that there was no mistaking it.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Texas was at this time the subject of violent\r\ndiscussion in Congress, in the press, and by individuals.  The\r\nadministration of President Tyler, then in power, was making the most\r\nstrenuous efforts to effect the annexation, which was, indeed, the great\r\nand absorbing question of the day.  During these discussions the greater\r\npart of the single rifle regiment in the army--the 2d dragoons, which\r\nhad been dismounted a year or two before, and designated \"Dismounted\r\nRifles\"--was stationed at Fort Jessup, Louisiana, some twenty-five miles\r\neast of the Texas line, to observe the frontier.  About the 1st of May\r\nthe 3d infantry was ordered from Jefferson Barracks to Louisiana, to go\r\ninto camp in the neighborhood of Fort Jessup, and there await further\r\norders.  The troops were embarked on steamers and were on their way down\r\nthe Mississippi within a few days after the receipt of this order.\r\nAbout the time they started I obtained a leave of absence for twenty\r\ndays to go to Ohio to visit my parents.  I was obliged to go to St.\r\nLouis to take a steamer for Louisville or Cincinnati, or the first\r\nsteamer going up the Ohio River to any point.  Before I left St. Louis\r\norders were received at Jefferson Barracks for the 4th infantry to\r\nfollow the 3d.  A messenger was sent after me to stop my leaving; but\r\nbefore he could reach me I was off, totally ignorant of these events.  A\r\nday or two after my arrival at Bethel I received a letter from a\r\nclassmate and fellow lieutenant in the 4th, informing me of the\r\ncircumstances related above, and advising me not to open any letter post\r\nmarked St. Louis or Jefferson Barracks, until the expiration of my\r\nleave, and saying that he would pack up my things and take them along\r\nfor me.  His advice was not necessary, for no other letter was sent to\r\nme.  I now discovered that I was exceedingly anxious to get back to\r\nJefferson Barracks, and I understood the reason without explanation from\r\nany one.  My leave of absence required me to report for duty, at\r\nJefferson Barracks, at the end of twenty days.  I knew my regiment had\r\ngone up the Red River, but I was not disposed to break the letter of my\r\nleave; besides, if I had proceeded to Louisiana direct, I could not have\r\nreached there until after the expiration of my leave.  Accordingly, at\r\nthe end of the twenty days, I reported for duty to Lieutenant Ewell,\r\ncommanding at Jefferson Barracks, handing him at the same time my leave\r\nof absence.  After noticing the phraseology of the order--leaves of\r\nabsence were generally worded, \"at the end of which time he will report\r\nfor duty with his proper command\"--he said he would give me an order to\r\njoin my regiment in Louisiana.  I then asked for a few days' leave\r\nbefore starting, which he readily granted.  This was the same Ewell who\r\nacquired considerable reputation as a Confederate general during the\r\nrebellion.  He was a man much esteemed, and deservedly so, in the old\r\narmy, and proved himself a gallant and efficient officer in two wars\r\n--both in my estimation unholy.\r\n\r\nI immediately procured a horse and started for the country, taking no\r\nbaggage with me, of course.  There is an insignificant creek--the\r\nGravois--between Jefferson Barracks and the place to which I was going,\r\nand at that day there was not a bridge over it from its source to its\r\nmouth.  There is not water enough in the creek at ordinary stages to run\r\na coffee mill, and at low water there is none running whatever.  On this\r\noccasion it had been raining heavily, and, when the creek was reached, I\r\nfound the banks full to overflowing, and the current rapid.  I looked at\r\nit a moment to consider what to do.  One of my superstitions had always\r\nbeen when I started to go any where, or to do anything, not to turn\r\nback, or stop until the thing intended was accomplished.  I have\r\nfrequently started to go to places where I had never been and to which I\r\ndid not know the way, depending upon making inquiries on the road, and\r\nif I got past the place without knowing it, instead of turning back, I\r\nwould go on until a road was found turning in the right direction, take\r\nthat, and come in by the other side.  So I struck into the stream, and\r\nin an instant the horse was swimming and I being carried down by the\r\ncurrent.  I headed the horse towards the other bank and soon reached it,\r\nwet through and without other clothes on that side of the stream.  I\r\nwent on, however, to my destination and borrowed a dry suit from my\r\n--future--brother-in-law.  We were not of the same size, but the clothes\r\nanswered every purpose until I got more of my own.\r\n\r\nBefore I returned I mustered up courage to make known, in the most\r\nawkward manner imaginable, the discovery I had made on learning that the\r\n4th infantry had been ordered away from Jefferson Barracks.  The young\r\nlady afterwards admitted that she too, although until then she had never\r\nlooked upon me other than as a visitor whose company was agreeable to\r\nher, had experienced a depression of spirits she could not account for\r\nwhen the regiment left.  Before separating it was definitely understood\r\nthat at a convenient time we would join our fortunes, and not let the\r\nremoval of a regiment trouble us.  This was in May, 1844.  It was the\r\n22d of August, 1848, before the fulfilment of this agreement.  My duties\r\nkept me on the frontier of Louisiana with the Army of Observation during\r\nthe pendency of Annexation; and afterwards I was absent through the war\r\nwith Mexico, provoked by the action of the army, if not by the\r\nannexation itself. During that time there was a constant correspondence\r\nbetween Miss Dent and myself, but we only met once in the period of four\r\nyears and three months.  In May, 1845, I procured a leave for twenty\r\ndays, visited St. Louis, and obtained the consent of the parents for the\r\nunion, which had not been asked for before.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, it was never my intention to remain in the army long,\r\nbut to prepare myself for a professorship in some college.  Accordingly,\r\nsoon after I was settled at Jefferson Barracks, I wrote a letter to\r\nProfessor Church--Professor of Mathematics at West Point--requesting him\r\nto ask my designation as his assistant, when next a detail had to be\r\nmade. Assistant professors at West Point are all officers of the army,\r\nsupposed to be selected for their special fitness for the particular\r\nbranch of study they are assigned to teach.  The answer from Professor\r\nChurch was entirely satisfactory, and no doubt I should have been\r\ndetailed a year or two later but for the Mexican War coming on.\r\nAccordingly I laid out for myself a course of studies to be pursued in\r\ngarrison, with regularity, if not persistency.  I reviewed my West Point\r\ncourse of mathematics during the seven months at Jefferson Barracks, and\r\nread many valuable historical works, besides an occasional novel.  To\r\nhelp my memory I kept a book in which I would write up, from time to\r\ntime, my recollections of all I had read since last posting it.  When\r\nthe regiment was ordered away, I being absent at the time, my effects\r\nwere packed up by Lieutenant Haslett, of the 4th infantry, and taken\r\nalong.  I never saw my journal after, nor did I ever keep another,\r\nexcept for a portion of the time while travelling abroad.  Often since a\r\nfear has crossed my mind lest that book might turn up yet, and fall into\r\nthe hands of some malicious person who would publish it.  I know its\r\nappearance would cause me as much heart-burning as my youthful\r\nhorse-trade, or the later rebuke for wearing uniform clothes.\r\n\r\nThe 3d infantry had selected camping grounds on the reservation at Fort\r\nJessup, about midway between the Red River and the Sabine.  Our orders\r\nrequired us to go into camp in the same neighborhood, and await further\r\ninstructions.  Those authorized to do so selected a place in the pine\r\nwoods, between the old town of Natchitoches and Grand Ecore, about three\r\nmiles from each, and on high ground back from the river.  The place was\r\ngiven the name of Camp Salubrity, and proved entitled to it. The camp\r\nwas on a high, sandy, pine ridge, with spring branches in the valley, in\r\nfront and rear.  The springs furnished an abundance of cool, pure water,\r\nand the ridge was above the flight of mosquitoes, which abound in that\r\nregion in great multitudes and of great voracity.  In the valley they\r\nswarmed in myriads, but never came to the summit of the ridge.  The\r\nregiment occupied this camp six months before the first death occurred,\r\nand that was caused by an accident.\r\n\r\nThere was no intimation given that the removal of the 3d and 4th\r\nregiments of infantry to the western border of Louisiana was occasioned\r\nin any way by the prospective annexation of Texas, but it was generally\r\nunderstood that such was the case. Ostensibly we were intended to\r\nprevent filibustering into Texas, but really as a menace to Mexico in\r\ncase she appeared to contemplate war.  Generally the officers of the\r\narmy were indifferent whether the annexation was consummated or not; but\r\nnot so all of them.  For myself, I was bitterly opposed to the measure,\r\nand to this day regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most\r\nunjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.  It was an\r\ninstance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies,\r\nin not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional\r\nterritory.  Texas was originally a state belonging to the republic of\r\nMexico.  It extended from the Sabine River on the east to the Rio Grande\r\non the west, and from the Gulf of Mexico on the south and east to the\r\nterritory of the United States and New Mexico--another Mexican state at\r\nthat time--on the north and west.  An empire in territory, it had but a\r\nvery sparse population, until settled by Americans who had received\r\nauthority from Mexico to colonize. These colonists paid very little\r\nattention to the supreme government, and introduced slavery into the\r\nstate almost from the start, though the constitution of Mexico did not,\r\nnor does it now, sanction that institution.  Soon they set up an\r\nindependent government of their own, and war existed, between Texas and\r\nMexico, in name from that time until 1836, when active hostilities very\r\nnearly ceased upon the capture of Santa Anna, the Mexican President.\r\nBefore long, however, the same people--who with permission of Mexico had\r\ncolonized Texas, and afterwards set up slavery there, and then seceded\r\nas soon as they felt strong enough to do so--offered themselves and the\r\nState to the United States, and in 1845 their offer was accepted.  The\r\noccupation, separation and annexation were, from the inception of the\r\nmovement to its final consummation, a conspiracy to acquire territory\r\nout of which slave states might be formed for the American Union.\r\n\r\nEven if the annexation itself could be justified, the manner in which\r\nthe subsequent war was forced upon Mexico cannot.  The fact is,\r\nannexationists wanted more territory than they could possibly lay any\r\nclaim to, as part of the new acquisition. Texas, as an independent\r\nState, never had exercised jurisdiction over the territory between the\r\nNueces River and the Rio Grande. Mexico had never recognized the\r\nindependence of Texas, and maintained that, even if independent, the\r\nState had no claim south of the Nueces.  I am aware that a treaty, made\r\nby the Texans with Santa Anna while he was under duress, ceded all the\r\nterritory between the Nueces and the Rio Grande--, but he was a prisoner\r\nof war when the treaty was made, and his life was in jeopardy.  He knew,\r\ntoo, that he deserved execution at the hands of the Texans, if they\r\nshould ever capture him.  The Texans, if they had taken his life, would\r\nhave only followed the example set by Santa Anna himself a few years\r\nbefore, when he executed the entire garrison of the Alamo and the\r\nvillagers of Goliad.\r\n\r\nIn taking military possession of Texas after annexation, the army of\r\noccupation, under General Taylor, was directed to occupy the disputed\r\nterritory.  The army did not stop at the Nueces and offer to negotiate\r\nfor a settlement of the boundary question, but went beyond, apparently\r\nin order to force Mexico to initiate war.  It is to the credit of the\r\nAmerican nation, however, that after conquering Mexico, and while\r\npractically holding the country in our possession, so that we could have\r\nretained the whole of it, or made any terms we chose, we paid a round\r\nsum for the additional territory taken; more than it was worth, or was\r\nlikely to be, to Mexico.  To us it was an empire and of incalculable\r\nvalue; but it might have been obtained by other means.  The Southern\r\nrebellion was largely the outgrowth of the Mexican war.  Nations, like\r\nindividuals, are punished for their transgressions.  We got our\r\npunishment in the most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe 4th infantry went into camp at Salubrity in the month of May, 1844,\r\nwith instructions, as I have said, to await further orders.  At first,\r\nofficers and men occupied ordinary tents.  As the summer heat increased\r\nthese were covered by sheds to break the rays of the sun.  The summer\r\nwas whiled away in social enjoyments among the officers, in visiting\r\nthose stationed at, and near, Fort Jessup, twenty-five miles away,\r\nvisiting the planters on the Red River, and the citizens of Natchitoches\r\nand Grand Ecore.  There was much pleasant intercourse between the\r\ninhabitants and the officers of the army.  I retain very agreeable\r\nrecollections of my stay at Camp Salubrity, and of the acquaintances\r\nmade there, and no doubt my feeling is shared by the few officers living\r\nwho were there at the time.  I can call to mind only two officers of the\r\n4th infantry, besides myself, who were at Camp Salubrity with the\r\nregiment, who are now alive.\r\n\r\nWith a war in prospect, and belonging to a regiment that had an unusual\r\nnumber of officers detailed on special duty away from the regiment, my\r\nhopes of being ordered to West Point as instructor vanished.  At the\r\ntime of which I now write, officers in the quartermaster's, commissary's\r\nand adjutant--general's departments were appointed from the line of the\r\narmy, and did not vacate their regimental commissions until their\r\nregimental and staff commissions were for the same grades.  Generally\r\nlieutenants were appointed to captaincies to fill vacancies in the staff\r\ncorps.  If they should reach a captaincy in the line before they arrived\r\nat a majority in the staff, they would elect which commission they would\r\nretain.  In the 4th infantry, in 1844, at least six line officers were\r\non duty in the staff, and therefore permanently detached from the\r\nregiment.  Under these circumstances I gave up everything like a special\r\ncourse of reading, and only read thereafter for my own amusement, and\r\nnot very much for that, until the war was over.  I kept a horse and\r\nrode, and staid out of doors most of the time by day, and entirely\r\nrecovered from the cough which I had carried from West Point, and from\r\nall indications of consumption.  I have often thought that my life was\r\nsaved, and my health restored, by exercise and exposure, enforced by an\r\nadministrative act, and a war, both of which I disapproved.\r\n\r\nAs summer wore away, and cool days and colder nights came upon us, the\r\ntents. We were occupying ceased to afford comfortable quarters; and\r\n\"further orders\" not reaching us, we began to look about to remedy the\r\nhardship.  Men were put to work getting out timber to build huts, and in\r\na very short time all were comfortably housed--privates as well as\r\nofficers.  The outlay by the government in accomplishing this was\r\nnothing, or nearly nothing.  The winter was spent more agreeably than\r\nthe summer had been.  There were occasional parties given by the\r\nplanters along the \"coast\"--as the bottom lands on the Red River were\r\ncalled.  The climate was delightful.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the short session of Congress of 1844-5, the bill for\r\nthe annexation of Texas to the United States was passed.  It reached\r\nPresident Tyler on the 1st of March, 1845, and promptly received his\r\napproval.  When the news reached us we began to look again for \"further\r\norders.\"  They did not arrive promptly, and on the 1st of May following\r\nI asked and obtained a leave of absence for twenty days, for the purpose\r\nof visiting--St. Louis.  The object of this visit has been before\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nEarly in July the long expected orders were received, but they only took\r\nthe regiment to New Orleans Barracks.  We reached there before the\r\nmiddle of the month, and again waited weeks for still further orders.\r\nThe yellow fever was raging in New Orleans during the time we remained\r\nthere, and the streets of the city had the appearance of a continuous\r\nwell-observed Sunday.  I recollect but one occasion when this observance\r\nseemed to be broken by the inhabitants.  One morning about daylight I\r\nhappened to be awake, and, hearing the discharge of a rifle not far off,\r\nI looked out to ascertain where the sound came from.  I observed a\r\ncouple of clusters of men near by, and learned afterwards that \"it was\r\nnothing; only a couple of gentlemen deciding a difference of opinion\r\nwith rifles, at twenty paces.\"  I do not remember if either was killed,\r\nor even hurt, but no doubt the question of difference was settled\r\nsatisfactorily, and \"honorably,\" in the estimation of the parties\r\nengaged.  I do not believe I ever would have the courage to fight a\r\nduel.  If any man should wrong me to the extent of my being willing to\r\nkill him, I would not be willing to give him the choice of weapons with\r\nwhich it should be done, and of the time, place and distance separating\r\nus, when I executed him.  If I should do another such a wrong as to\r\njustify him in killing me, I would make any reasonable atonement within\r\nmy power, if convinced of the wrong done.  I place my opposition to\r\nduelling on higher grounds than here stated.  No doubt a majority of the\r\nduels fought have been for want of moral courage on the part of those\r\nengaged to decline.\r\n\r\nAt Camp Salubrity, and when we went to New Orleans Barracks, the 4th\r\ninfantry was commanded by Colonel Vose, then an old gentleman who had\r\nnot commanded on drill for a number of years.  He was not a man to\r\ndiscover infirmity in the presence of danger.  It now appeared that war\r\nwas imminent, and he felt that it was his duty to brush up his tactics.\r\nAccordingly, when we got settled down at our new post, he took command\r\nof the regiment at a battalion drill.  Only two or three evolutions had\r\nbeen gone through when he dismissed the battalion, and, turning to go to\r\nhis own quarters, dropped dead.  He had not been complaining of ill\r\nhealth, but no doubt died of heart disease.  He was a most estimable\r\nman, of exemplary habits, and by no means the author of his own disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCORPUS CHRISTI--MEXICAN SMUGGLING--SPANISH RULE IN MEXICO--SUPPLYING\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nEarly in September the regiment left New Orleans for Corpus Christi, now\r\nin Texas.  Ocean steamers were not then common, and the passage was made\r\nin sailing vessels.  At that time there was not more than three feet of\r\nwater in the channel at the outlet of Corpus Christi Bay; the\r\ndebarkation, therefore, had to take place by small steamers, and at an\r\nisland in the channel called Shell Island, the ships anchoring some\r\nmiles out from shore. This made the work slow, and as the army was only\r\nsupplied with one or two steamers, it took a number of days to effect\r\nthe landing of a single regiment with its stores, camp and garrison\r\nequipage, etc.  There happened to be pleasant weather while this was\r\ngoing on, but the land-swell was so great that when the ship and steamer\r\nwere on opposite sides of the same wave they would be at considerable\r\ndistance apart.  The men and baggage were let down to a point higher\r\nthan the lower deck of the steamer, and when ship and steamer got into\r\nthe trough between the waves, and were close together, the load would be\r\ndrawn over the steamer and rapidly run down until it rested on the deck.\r\n\r\nAfter I had gone ashore, and had been on guard several days at Shell\r\nIsland, quite six miles from the ship, I had occasion for some reason or\r\nother to return on board.  While on the Suviah--I think that was the\r\nname of our vessel--I heard a tremendous racket at the other end of the\r\nship, and much and excited sailor language, such as \"damn your eyes,\"\r\netc.  In a moment or two the captain, who was an excitable little man,\r\ndying with consumption, and not weighing much over a hundred pounds,\r\ncame running out, carrying a sabre nearly as large and as heavy as he\r\nwas, and crying, that his men had mutinied.  It was necessary to sustain\r\nthe captain without question, and in a few minutes all the sailors\r\ncharged with mutiny were in irons.  I rather felt for a time a wish that\r\nI had not gone aboard just then.  As the men charged with mutiny\r\nsubmitted to being placed in irons without resistance, I always doubted\r\nif they knew that they had mutinied until they were told.\r\n\r\nBy the time I was ready to leave the ship again I thought I had learned\r\nenough of the working of the double and single pulley, by which\r\npassengers were let down from the upper deck of the ship to the steamer\r\nbelow, and determined to let myself down without assistance.  Without\r\nsaying anything of my intentions to any one, I mounted the railing, and\r\ntaking hold of the centre rope, just below the upper block, I put one\r\nfoot on the hook below the lower block, and stepped off just as I did so\r\nsome one called out \"hold on.\"  It was too late.  I tried to \"hold on\"\r\nwith all my might, but my heels went up, and my head went down so\r\nrapidly that my hold broke, and I plunged head foremost into the water,\r\nsome twenty-five feet below, with such velocity that it seemed to me I\r\nnever would stop.  When I came to the surface again, being a fair\r\nswimmer, and not having lost my presence of mind, I swam around until a\r\nbucket was let down for me, and I was drawn up without a scratch or\r\ninjury. I do not believe there was a man on board who sympathized with\r\nme in the least when they found me uninjured.  I rather enjoyed the joke\r\nmyself. The captain of the Suviah died of his disease a few months later,\r\nand I believe before the mutineers were tried.  I hope they got clear,\r\nbecause, as before stated, I always thought the mutiny was all in the\r\nbrain of a very weak and sick man.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching shore, or Shell Island, the labor of getting to Corpus\r\nChristi was slow and tedious.  There was, if my memory serves me, but\r\none small steamer to transport troops and baggage when the 4th infantry\r\narrived.  Others were procured later.  The distance from Shell Island to\r\nCorpus Christi was some sixteen or eighteen miles.  The channel to the\r\nbay was so shallow that the steamer, small as it was, had to be dragged\r\nover the bottom when loaded.  Not more than one trip a day could be\r\neffected.  Later this was remedied, by deepening the channel and\r\nincreasing the number of vessels suitable to its navigation.\r\n\r\nCorpus Christi is near the head of the bay of the same name, formed by\r\nthe entrance of the Nueces River into tide-water, and is on the west\r\nbank of that bay.  At the time of its first occupancy by United States\r\ntroops there was a small Mexican hamlet there, containing probably less\r\nthan one hundred souls. There was, in addition, a small American trading\r\npost, at which goods were sold to Mexican smugglers.  All goods were put\r\nup in compact packages of about one hundred pounds each, suitable for\r\nloading on pack mules.  Two of these packages made a load for an\r\nordinary Mexican mule, and three for the larger ones.  The bulk of the\r\ntrade was in leaf tobacco, and domestic cotton-cloths and calicoes.  The\r\nMexicans had, before the arrival of the army, but little to offer in\r\nexchange except silver.  The trade in tobacco was enormous, considering\r\nthe population to be supplied.  Almost every Mexican above the age of\r\nten years, and many much younger, smoked the cigarette.  Nearly every\r\nMexican carried a pouch of leaf tobacco, powdered by rolling in the\r\nhands, and a roll of corn husks to make wrappers.  The cigarettes were\r\nmade by the smokers as they used them.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of which I write, and for years afterwards--I think until\r\nthe administration of President Juarez--the cultivation, manufacture and\r\nsale of tobacco constituted a government monopoly, and paid the bulk of\r\nthe revenue collected from internal sources.  The price was enormously\r\nhigh, and made successful smuggling very profitable.  The difficulty of\r\nobtaining tobacco is probably the reason why everybody, male and female,\r\nused it at that time.  I know from my own experience that when I was at\r\nWest Point, the fact that tobacco, in every form, was prohibited, and\r\nthe mere possession of the weed severely punished, made the majority of\r\nthe cadets, myself included, try to acquire the habit of using it.  I\r\nfailed utterly at the time and for many years afterward; but the\r\nmajority accomplished the object of their youthful ambition.\r\n\r\nUnder Spanish rule Mexico was prohibited from producing anything that\r\nthe mother-country could supply.  This rule excluded the cultivation of\r\nthe grape, olive and many other articles to which the soil and climate\r\nwere well adapted.  The country was governed for \"revenue only;\" and\r\ntobacco, which cannot be raised in Spain, but is indigenous to Mexico,\r\noffered a fine instrumentality for securing this prime object of\r\ngovernment.  The native population had been in the habit of using \"the\r\nweed\" from a period, back of any recorded history of this continent.\r\nBad habits--if not restrained by law or public opinion--spread more\r\nrapidly and universally than good ones, and the Spanish colonists\r\nadopted the use of tobacco almost as generally as the natives.  Spain,\r\ntherefore, in order to secure the largest revenue from this source,\r\nprohibited the cultivation, except in specified localities--and in these\r\nplaces farmed out the privilege at a very high price.  The tobacco when\r\nraised could only be sold to the government, and the price to the\r\nconsumer was limited only by the avarice of the authorities, and the\r\ncapacity of the people to pay.\r\n\r\nAll laws for the government of the country were enacted in Spain, and\r\nthe officers for their execution were appointed by the Crown, and sent\r\nout to the New El Dorado.  The Mexicans had been brought up ignorant of\r\nhow to legislate or how to rule. When they gained their independence,\r\nafter many years of war, it was the most natural thing in the world that\r\nthey should adopt as their own the laws then in existence.  The only\r\nchange was, that Mexico became her own executor of the laws and the\r\nrecipient of the revenues.  The tobacco tax, yielding so large a revenue\r\nunder the law as it stood, was one of the last, if not the very last, of\r\nthe obnoxious imposts to be repealed.  Now, the citizens are allowed to\r\ncultivate any crops the soil will yield.  Tobacco is cheap, and every\r\nquality can be produced. Its use is by no means so general as when I\r\nfirst visited the country.\r\n\r\nGradually the \"Army of Occupation\" assembled at Corpus Christi.  When it\r\nwas all together it consisted of seven companies of the 2d regiment of\r\ndragoons, four companies of light artillery, five regiments of infantry\r\n--the 3d, 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th--and one regiment of artillery acting as\r\ninfantry--not more than three thousand men in all.  General Zachary\r\nTaylor commanded the whole.  There were troops enough in one body to\r\nestablish a drill and discipline sufficient to fit men and officers for\r\nall they were capable of in case of battle.  The rank and file were\r\ncomposed of men who had enlisted in time of peace, to serve for seven\r\ndollars a month, and were necessarily inferior as material to the\r\naverage volunteers enlisted later in the war expressly to fight, and\r\nalso to the volunteers in the war for the preservation of the Union.\r\nThe men engaged in the Mexican war were brave, and the officers of the\r\nregular army, from highest to lowest, were educated in their profession.\r\nA more efficient army for its number and armament, I do not believe ever\r\nfought a battle than the one commanded by General Taylor in his first\r\ntwo engagements on Mexican--or Texan soil.\r\n\r\nThe presence of United States troops on the edge of the disputed\r\nterritory furthest from the Mexican settlements, was not sufficient to\r\nprovoke hostilities.  We were sent to provoke a fight, but it was\r\nessential that Mexico should commence it.  It was very doubtful whether\r\nCongress would declare war; but if Mexico should attack our troops, the\r\nExecutive could announce, \"Whereas, war exists by the acts of, etc.,\"\r\nand prosecute the contest with vigor.  Once initiated there were but few\r\npublic men who would have the courage to oppose it.  Experience proves\r\nthat the man who obstructs a war in which his nation is engaged, no\r\nmatter whether right or wrong, occupies no enviable place in life or\r\nhistory.  Better for him, individually, to advocate \"war, pestilence,\r\nand famine,\" than to act as obstructionist to a war already begun.  The\r\nhistory of the defeated rebel will be honorable hereafter, compared with\r\nthat of the Northern man who aided him by conspiring against his\r\ngovernment while protected by it.  The most favorable posthumous history\r\nthe stay-at-home traitor can hope for is--oblivion.\r\n\r\nMexico showing no willingness to come to the Nueces to drive the\r\ninvaders from her soil, it became necessary for the \"invaders\" to\r\napproach to within a convenient distance to be struck. Accordingly,\r\npreparations were begun for moving the army to the Rio Grande, to a\r\npoint near Matamoras.  It was desirable to occupy a position near the\r\nlargest centre of population possible to reach, without absolutely\r\ninvading territory to which we set up no claim whatever.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Corpus Christi to Matamoras is about one hundred and\r\nfifty miles.  The country does not abound in fresh water, and the length\r\nof the marches had to be regulated by the distance between water\r\nsupplies.  Besides the streams, there were occasional pools, filled\r\nduring the rainy season, some probably made by the traders, who\r\ntravelled constantly between Corpus Christi and the Rio Grande, and some\r\nby the buffalo. There was not at that time a single habitation,\r\ncultivated field, or herd of domestic animals, between Corpus Christi\r\nand Matamoras.  It was necessary, therefore, to have a wagon train\r\nsufficiently large to transport the camp and garrison equipage,\r\nofficers' baggage, rations for the army, and part rations of grain for\r\nthe artillery horses and all the animals taken from the north, where\r\nthey had been accustomed to having their forage furnished them.  The\r\narmy was but indifferently supplied with transportation.  Wagons and\r\nharness could easily be supplied from the north but mules and horses\r\ncould not so readily be brought.  The American traders and Mexican\r\nsmugglers came to the relief.  Contracts were made for mules at from\r\neight to eleven dollars each.  The smugglers furnished the animals, and\r\ntook their pay in goods of the description before mentioned.  I doubt\r\nwhether the Mexicans received in value from the traders five dollars per\r\nhead for the animals they furnished, and still more, whether they paid\r\nanything but their own time in procuring them.  Such is trade; such is\r\nwar.  The government paid in hard cash to the contractor the stipulated\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nBetween the Rio Grande and the Nueces there was at that time a large\r\nband of wild horses feeding; as numerous, probably, as the band of\r\nbuffalo roaming further north was before its rapid extermination\r\ncommenced.  The Mexicans used to capture these in large numbers and\r\nbring them into the American settlements and sell them.  A picked animal\r\ncould be purchased at from eight to twelve dollars, but taken at\r\nwholesale, they could be bought for thirty-six dollars a dozen.  Some of\r\nthese were purchased for the army, and answered a most useful purpose.\r\nThe horses were generally very strong, formed much like the Norman\r\nhorse, and with very heavy manes and tails.  A number of officers\r\nsupplied themselves with these, and they generally rendered as useful\r\nservice as the northern animal in fact they were much better when\r\ngrazing was the only means of supplying forage.\r\n\r\nThere was no need for haste, and some months were consumed in the\r\nnecessary preparations for a move.  In the meantime the army was engaged\r\nin all the duties pertaining to the officer and the soldier.  Twice,\r\nthat I remember, small trains were sent from Corpus Christi, with\r\ncavalry escorts, to San Antonio and Austin, with paymasters and funds to\r\npay off small detachments of troops stationed at those places.  General\r\nTaylor encouraged officers to accompany these expeditions.  I\r\naccompanied one of them in December, 1845.  The distance from Corpus\r\nChristi to San Antonio was then computed at one hundred and fifty miles.\r\nNow that roads exist it is probably less.  From San Antonio to Austin we\r\ncomputed the distance at one hundred and ten miles, and from the latter\r\nplace back to Corpus Christi at over two hundred miles.  I know the\r\ndistance now from San Antonio to Austin is but little over eighty miles,\r\nso that our computation was probably too high.\r\n\r\nThere was not at the time an individual living between Corpus Christi\r\nand San Antonio until within about thirty miles of the latter point,\r\nwhere there were a few scattering Mexican settlements along the San\r\nAntonio River.  The people in at least one of these hamlets lived\r\nunderground for protection against the Indians.  The country abounded in\r\ngame, such as deer and antelope, with abundance of wild turkeys along\r\nthe streams and where there were nut-bearing woods.  On the Nueces,\r\nabout twenty-five miles up from Corpus Christi, were a few log cabins,\r\nthe remains of a town called San Patricio, but the inhabitants had all\r\nbeen massacred by the Indians, or driven away.\r\n\r\nSan Antonio was about equally divided in population between Americans\r\nand Mexicans.  From there to Austin there was not a single residence\r\nexcept at New Braunfels, on the Guadalupe River.  At that point was a\r\nsettlement of Germans who had only that year come into the State.  At\r\nall events they were living in small huts, about such as soldiers would\r\nhastily construct for temporary occupation.  From Austin to Corpus\r\nChristi there was only a small settlement at Bastrop, with a few farms\r\nalong the Colorado River; but after leaving that, there were no\r\nsettlements except the home of one man, with one female slave, at the\r\nold town of Goliad.  Some of the houses were still standing.  Goliad had\r\nbeen quite a village for the period and region, but some years before\r\nthere had been a Mexican massacre, in which every inhabitant had been\r\nkilled or driven away.  This, with the massacre of the prisoners in the\r\nAlamo, San Antonio, about the same time, more than three hundred men in\r\nall, furnished the strongest justification the Texans had for carrying\r\non the war with so much cruelty.  In fact, from that time until the\r\nMexican war, the hostilities between Texans and Mexicans was so great\r\nthat neither was safe in the neighborhood of the other who might be in\r\nsuperior numbers or possessed of superior arms.  The man we found living\r\nthere seemed like an old friend; he had come from near Fort Jessup,\r\nLouisiana, where the officers of the 3d and 4th infantry and the 2d\r\ndragoons had known him and his family.  He had emigrated in advance of\r\nhis family to build up a home for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTRIP TO AUSTIN--PROMOTION TO FULL SECOND LIEUTENANT--ARMY OF OCCUPATION.\r\n\r\nWhen our party left Corpus Christi it was quite large, including the\r\ncavalry escort, Paymaster, Major Dix, his clerk and the officers who,\r\nlike myself, were simply on leave; but all the officers on leave, except\r\nLieutenant Benjamin--afterwards killed in the valley of Mexico\r\n--Lieutenant, now General, Augur, and myself, concluded to spend their\r\nallotted time at San Antonio and return from there.  We were all to be\r\nback at Corpus Christi by the end of the month.  The paymaster was\r\ndetained in Austin so long that, if we had waited for him, we would have\r\nexceeded our leave.  We concluded, therefore, to start back at once with\r\nthe animals we had, and having to rely principally on grass for their\r\nfood, it was a good six days' journey.  We had to sleep on the prairie\r\nevery night, except at Goliad, and possibly one night on the Colorado,\r\nwithout shelter and with only such food as we carried with us, and\r\nprepared ourselves.  The journey was hazardous on account of Indians,\r\nand there were white men in Texas whom I would not have cared to meet in\r\na secluded place. Lieutenant Augur was taken seriously sick before we\r\nreached Goliad and at a distance from any habitation.  To add to the\r\ncomplication, his horse--a mustang that had probably been captured from\r\nthe band of wild horses before alluded to, and of undoubted longevity at\r\nhis capture--gave out. It was absolutely necessary to get for ward to\r\nGoliad to find a shelter for our sick companion.  By dint of patience\r\nand exceedingly slow movements, Goliad was at last reached, and a\r\nshelter and bed secured for our patient.  We remained over a day, hoping\r\nthat Augur might recover sufficiently to resume his travels.  He did\r\nnot, however, and knowing that Major Dix would be along in a few days,\r\nwith his wagon-train, now empty, and escort, we arranged with our\r\nLouisiana friend to take the best of care of the sick lieutenant until\r\nthus relieved, and went on.\r\n\r\nI had never been a sportsman in my life; had scarcely ever gone in\r\nsearch of game, and rarely seen any when looking for it.  On this trip\r\nthere was no minute of time while travelling between San Patricio and\r\nthe settlements on the San Antonio River, from San Antonio to Austin,\r\nand again from the Colorado River back to San Patricio, when deer or\r\nantelope could not be seen in great numbers. Each officer carried a\r\nshot-gun, and every evening, after going into camp, some would go out\r\nand soon return with venison and wild turkeys enough for the entire\r\ncamp.  I, however, never went out, and had no occasion to fire my gun;\r\nexcept, being detained over a day at Goliad, Benjamin and I concluded to\r\ngo down to the creek--which was fringed with timber, much of it the\r\npecan--and bring back a few turkeys.  We had scarcely reached the edge\r\nof the timber when I heard the flutter of wings overhead, and in an\r\ninstant I saw two or three turkeys flying away.  These were soon\r\nfollowed by more, then more, and more, until a flock of twenty or thirty\r\nhad left from just over my head.  All this time I stood watching the\r\nturkeys to see where they flew--with my gun on my shoulder, and never\r\nonce thought of levelling it at the birds.  When I had time to reflect\r\nupon the matter, I came to the conclusion that as a sportsman I was a\r\nfailure, and went back to the house.  Benjamin remained out, and got as\r\nmany turkeys as he wanted to carry back.\r\n\r\nAfter the second night at Goliad, Benjamin and I started to make the\r\nremainder of the journey alone.  We reached Corpus Christi just in time\r\nto avoid \"absence without leave.\"  We met no one not even an Indian\r\n--during the remainder of our journey, except at San Patricio.  A new\r\nsettlement had been started there in our absence of three weeks, induced\r\npossibly by the fact that there were houses already built, while the\r\nproximity of troops gave protection against the Indians.  On the evening\r\nof the first day out from Goliad we heard the most unearthly howling of\r\nwolves, directly in our front.  The prairie grass was tall and we could\r\nnot see the beasts, but the sound indicated that they were near.  To my\r\near it appeared that there must have been enough of them to devour our\r\nparty, horses and all, at a single meal.  The part of Ohio that I hailed\r\nfrom was not thickly settled, but wolves had been driven out long before\r\nI left.  Benjamin was from Indiana, still less populated, where the wolf\r\nyet roamed over the prairies.  He understood the nature of the animal\r\nand the capacity of a few to make believe there was an unlimited number\r\nof them.  He kept on towards the noise, unmoved.  I followed in his\r\ntrail, lacking moral courage to turn back and join our sick companion.\r\nI have no doubt that if Benjamin had proposed returning to Goliad, I\r\nwould not only have \"seconded the motion\" but have suggested that it\r\nwas very hard-hearted in us to leave Augur sick there in the first\r\nplace; but Benjamin did not propose turning back.  When he did speak it\r\nwas to ask: \"Grant, how many wolves do you think there are in that\r\npack?\" Knowing where he was from, and suspecting that he thought I would\r\nover-estimate the number, I determined to show my acquaintance with the\r\nanimal by putting the estimate below what possibly could be correct, and\r\nanswered:  \"Oh, about twenty,\" very indifferently.  He smiled and rode\r\non.  In a minute we were close upon them, and before they saw us.  There\r\nwere just TWO of them.  Seated upon their haunches, with their mouths\r\nclose together, they had made all the noise we had been hearing for the\r\npast ten minutes.  I have often thought of this incident since when I\r\nhave heard the noise of a few disappointed politicians who had deserted\r\ntheir associates.  There are always more of them before they are\r\ncounted.\r\n\r\nA week or two before leaving Corpus Christi on this trip, I had been\r\npromoted from brevet second-lieutenant, 4th infantry, to full\r\nsecond-lieutenant, 7th infantry.  Frank Gardner,(*1) of the 7th, was\r\npromoted to the 4th in the same orders.  We immediately made application\r\nto be transferred, so as to get back to our old regiments.  On my\r\nreturn, I found that our application had been approved at Washington.\r\nWhile in the 7th infantry I was in the company of Captain Holmes,\r\nafterwards a Lieutenant-general in the Confederate army. I never came in\r\ncontact with him in the war of the Rebellion, nor did he render any very\r\nconspicuous service in his high rank.  My transfer carried me to the\r\ncompany of Captain McCall, who resigned from the army after the Mexican\r\nwar and settled in Philadelphia.  He was prompt, however, to volunteer\r\nwhen the rebellion broke out, and soon rose to the rank of major-general\r\nin the Union army.  I was not fortunate enough to meet him after he\r\nresigned. In the old army he was esteemed very highly as a soldier and\r\ngentleman. Our relations were always most pleasant.\r\n\r\nThe preparations at Corpus Christi for an advance progressed as rapidly\r\nin the absence of some twenty or more lieutenants as if we had been\r\nthere.  The principal business consisted in securing mules, and getting\r\nthem broken to harness.  The process was slow but amusing.  The animals\r\nsold to the government were all young and unbroken, even to the saddle,\r\nand were quite as wild as the wild horses of the prairie.  Usually a\r\nnumber would be brought in by a company of Mexicans, partners in the\r\ndelivery.  The mules were first driven into a stockade, called a corral,\r\ninclosing an acre or more of ground.  The Mexicans,--who were all\r\nexperienced in throwing the lasso,--would go into the corral on\r\nhorseback, with their lassos attached to the pommels of their saddles.\r\nSoldiers detailed as teamsters and black smiths would also enter the\r\ncorral, the former with ropes to serve as halters, the latter with\r\nbranding irons and a fire to keep the irons heated.  A lasso was then\r\nthrown over the neck of a mule, when he would immediately go to the\r\nlength of his tether, first one end, then the other in the air.  While\r\nhe was thus plunging and gyrating, another lasso would be thrown by\r\nanother Mexican, catching the animal by a fore-foot.  This would bring\r\nthe mule to the ground, when he was seized and held by the teamsters\r\nwhile the blacksmith put upon him, with hot irons, the initials \"U. S.\"\r\nRopes were then put about the neck, with a slipnoose which would tighten\r\naround the throat if pulled.  With a man on each side holding these\r\nropes, the mule was released from his other bindings and allowed to\r\nrise.  With more or less difficulty he would be conducted to a picket\r\nrope outside and fastened there.  The delivery of that mule was then\r\ncomplete. This process was gone through with every mule and wild horse\r\nwith the army of occupation.\r\n\r\nThe method of breaking them was less cruel and much more amusing.  It is\r\na well-known fact that where domestic animals are used for specific\r\npurposes from generation to generation, the descendants are easily, as a\r\nrule, subdued to the same uses.  At that time in Northern Mexico the\r\nmule, or his ancestors, the horse and the ass, was seldom used except\r\nfor the saddle or pack.  At all events the Corpus Christi mule resisted\r\nthe new use to which he was being put.  The treatment he was subjected\r\nto in order to overcome his prejudices was summary and effective.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were principally foreigners who had enlisted in our large\r\ncities, and, with the exception of a chance drayman among them, it is\r\nnot probable that any of the men who reported themselves as competent\r\nteamsters had ever driven a mule-team in their lives, or indeed that\r\nmany had had any previous experience in driving any animal whatever to\r\nharness.  Numbers together can accomplish what twice their number acting\r\nindividually could not perform.  Five mules were allotted to each wagon.\r\nA teamster would select at the picket rope five animals of nearly the\r\nsame color and general appearance for his team.  With a full corps of\r\nassistants, other teamsters, he would then proceed to get his mules\r\ntogether.  In two's the men would approach each animal selected,\r\navoiding as far as possible its heels.  Two ropes would be put about the\r\nneck of each animal, with a slip noose, so that he could be choked if\r\ntoo unruly.  They were then led out, harnessed by force and hitched to\r\nthe wagon in the position they had to keep ever after.  Two men remained\r\non either side of the leader, with the lassos about its neck, and one\r\nman retained the same restraining influence over each of the others.\r\nAll being ready, the hold would be slackened and the team started. The\r\nfirst motion was generally five mules in the air at one time, backs\r\nbowed, hind feet extended to the rear.  After repeating this movement a\r\nfew times the leaders would start to run.  This would bring the\r\nbreeching tight against the mules at the wheels, which these last seemed\r\nto regard as a most unwarrantable attempt at coercion and would resist\r\nby taking a seat, sometimes going so far as to lie down.  In time all\r\nwere broken in to do their duty submissively if not cheerfully, but\r\nthere never was a time during the war when it was safe to let a Mexican\r\nmule get entirely loose.  Their drivers were all teamsters by the time\r\nthey got through.\r\n\r\nI recollect one case of a mule that had worked in a team under the\r\nsaddle, not only for some time at Corpus Christi, where he was broken,\r\nbut all the way to the point opposite Matamoras, then to Camargo, where\r\nhe got loose from his fastenings during the night.  He did not run away\r\nat first, but staid in the neighborhood for a day or two, coming up\r\nsometimes to the feed trough even; but on the approach of the teamster\r\nhe always got out of the way.  At last, growing tired of the constant\r\neffort to catch him, he disappeared altogether.  Nothing short of a\r\nMexican with his lasso could have caught him.  Regulations would not\r\nhave warranted the expenditure of a dollar in hiring a man with a lasso\r\nto catch that mule; but they did allow the expenditure \"of the mule,\" on\r\na certificate that he had run away without any fault of the\r\nquartermaster on whose returns he was borne, and also the purchase of\r\nanother to take his place.  I am a competent witness, for I was\r\nregimental quartermaster at the time.\r\n\r\nWhile at Corpus Christi all the officers who had a fancy for riding kept\r\nhorses.  The animals cost but little in the first instance, and when\r\npicketed they would get their living without any cost.  I had three not\r\nlong before the army moved, but a sad accident bereft me of them all at\r\none time.  A colored boy who gave them all the attention they got\r\n--besides looking after my tent and that of a class-mate and\r\nfellow-lieutenant and cooking for us, all for about eight dollars per\r\nmonth, was riding one to water and leading the other two.  The led\r\nhorses pulled him from his seat and all three ran away.  They never were\r\nheard of afterwards.  Shortly after that some one told Captain Bliss,\r\nGeneral Taylor's Adjutant-General, of my misfortune.  \"Yes; I heard\r\nGrant lost five or six dollars' worth of horses the other day,\" he\r\nreplied.  That was a slander; they were broken to the saddle when I got\r\nthem and cost nearly twenty dollars.  I never suspected the colored boy\r\nof malicious intent in letting them get away, because, if they had not\r\nescaped, he could have had one of them to ride on the long march then in\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nADVANCE OF THE ARMY--CROSSING THE COLORADO--THE RIO GRANDE.\r\n\r\nAt last the preparations were complete and orders were issued for the\r\nadvance to begin on the 8th of March.  General Taylor had an army of not\r\nmore than three thousand men.  One battery, the siege guns and all the\r\nconvalescent troops were sent on by water to Brazos Santiago, at the\r\nmouth of the Rio Grande.  A guard was left back at Corpus Christi to\r\nlook after public property and to take care of those who were too sick\r\nto be removed.  The remainder of the army, probably not more than twenty\r\nfive hundred men, was divided into three brigades, with the cavalry\r\nindependent.  Colonel Twiggs, with seven companies of dragoons and a\r\nbattery of light artillery, moved on the 8th.  He was followed by the\r\nthree infantry brigades, with a day's interval between the commands.\r\nThus the rear brigade did not move from Corpus Christi until the 11th of\r\nMarch.  In view of the immense bodies of men moved on the same day over\r\nnarrow roads, through dense forests and across large streams, in our\r\nlate war, it seems strange now that a body of less than three thousand\r\nmen should have been broken into four columns, separated by a day's\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor was opposed to anything like plundering by the troops,\r\nand in this instance, I doubt not, he looked upon the enemy as the\r\naggrieved party and was not willing to injure them further than his\r\ninstructions from Washington demanded.  His orders to the troops\r\nenjoined scrupulous regard for the rights of all peaceable persons and\r\nthe payment of the highest price for all supplies taken for the use of\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nAll officers of foot regiments who had horses were permitted to ride\r\nthem on the march when it did not interfere with their military duties.\r\nAs already related, having lost my \"five or six dollars' worth of\r\nhorses\" but a short time before I determined not to get another, but to\r\nmake the journey on foot.  My company commander, Captain McCall, had two\r\ngood American horses, of considerably more value in that country, where\r\nnative horses were cheap, than they were in the States. He used one\r\nhimself and wanted the other for his servant.  He was quite anxious to\r\nknow whether I did not intend to get me another horse before the march\r\nbegan.  I told him No; I belonged to a foot regiment.  I did not\r\nunderstand the object of his solicitude at the time, but, when we were\r\nabout to start, he said:  \"There, Grant, is a horse for you.\"  I found\r\nthat he could not bear the idea of his servant riding on a long march\r\nwhile his lieutenant went a-foot.  He had found a mustang, a three-year\r\nold colt only recently captured, which had been purchased by one of the\r\ncolored servants with the regiment for the sum of three dollars.  It was\r\nprobably the only horse at Corpus Christi that could have been purchased\r\njust then for any reasonable price.  Five dollars, sixty-six and\r\ntwo-thirds per cent. advance, induced the owner to part with the\r\nmustang.  I was sorry to take him, because I really felt that, belonging\r\nto a foot regiment, it was my duty to march with the men.  But I saw the\r\nCaptain's earnestness in the matter, and accepted the horse for the\r\ntrip.  The day we started was the first time the horse had ever been\r\nunder saddle. I had, however, but little difficulty in breaking him,\r\nthough for the first day there were frequent disagreements between us as\r\nto which way we should go, and sometimes whether we should go at all.\r\nAt no time during the day could I choose exactly the part of the column\r\nI would march with; but after that, I had as tractable a horse as any\r\nwith the army, and there was none that stood the trip better. He never\r\nate a mouthful of food on the journey except the grass he could pick\r\nwithin the length of his picket rope.\r\n\r\nA few days out from Corpus Christi, the immense herd of wild horses that\r\nranged at that time between the Nueces and the Rio Grande was seen\r\ndirectly in advance of the head of the column and but a few miles off.\r\nIt was the very band from which the horse I was riding had been captured\r\nbut a few weeks before. The column was halted for a rest, and a number\r\nof officers, myself among them, rode out two or three miles to the right\r\nto see the extent of the herd.  The country was a rolling prairie, and,\r\nfrom the higher ground, the vision was obstructed only by the earth's\r\ncurvature.  As far as the eye could reach to our right, the herd\r\nextended.  To the left, it extended equally. There was no estimating the\r\nnumber of animals in it; I have no idea that they could all have been\r\ncorralled in the State of Rhode Island, or Delaware, at one time.  If\r\nthey had been, they would have been so thick that the pasturage would\r\nhave given out the first day. People who saw the Southern herd of\r\nbuffalo, fifteen or twenty years ago, can appreciate the  size of the\r\nTexas band of wild horses in 1846.\r\n\r\nAt the point where the army struck the Little Colorado River, the stream\r\nwas quite wide and of sufficient depth for navigation. The water was\r\nbrackish and the banks were fringed with timber. Here the whole army\r\nconcentrated before attempting to cross. The army was not accompanied by\r\na pontoon train, and at that time the troops were not instructed in\r\nbridge building.  To add to the embarrassment of the situation, the army\r\nwas here, for the first time, threatened with opposition. Buglers,\r\nconcealed from our view by the brush on the opposite side, sounded the\r\n\"assembly,\" and other military calls.  Like the wolves before spoken of,\r\nthey gave the impression that there was a large number of them and that,\r\nif the troops were in proportion to the noise, they were sufficient to\r\ndevour General Taylor and his army.  There were probably but few troops,\r\nand those engaged principally in watching the movements of the\r\n\"invader.\"  A few of our cavalry dashed in, and forded and swam the\r\nstream, and all opposition was soon dispersed.  I do not remember that a\r\nsingle shot was fired.\r\n\r\nThe troops waded the stream, which was up to their necks in the deepest\r\npart.  Teams were crossed by attaching a long rope to the end of the\r\nwagon tongue passing it between the two swing mules and by the side of\r\nthe leader, hitching his bridle as well as the bridle of the mules in\r\nrear to it, and carrying the end to men on the opposite shore.  The bank\r\ndown to the water was steep on both sides.  A rope long enough to cross\r\nthe river, therefore, was attached to the back axle of the wagon, and\r\nmen behind would hold the rope to prevent the wagon \"beating\" the mules\r\ninto the water.  This latter rope also served the purpose of bringing\r\nthe end of the forward one back, to be used over again.  The water was\r\ndeep enough for a short distance to swim the little Mexican mules which\r\nthe army was then using, but they, and the wagons, were pulled through\r\nso fast by the men at the end of the rope ahead, that no time was left\r\nthem to show their obstinacy.  In this manner the artillery and\r\ntransportation of the \"army of occupation\" crossed the Colorado River.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the month of March the advance of the army reached\r\nthe Rio Grande and went into camp near the banks of the river, opposite\r\nthe city of Matamoras and almost under the guns of a small fort at the\r\nlower end of the town.  There was not at that time a single habitation\r\nfrom Corpus Christi until the Rio Grande was reached.\r\n\r\nThe work of fortifying was commenced at once.  The fort was laid out by\r\nthe engineers, but the work was done by the soldiers under the\r\nsupervision of their officers, the chief engineer retaining general\r\ndirections.  The Mexicans now became so incensed at our near approach\r\nthat some of their troops crossed the river above us, and made it unsafe\r\nfor small bodies of men to go far beyond the limits of camp.  They\r\ncaptured two companies of dragoons, commanded by Captains Thornton and\r\nHardee.  The latter figured as a general in the late war, on the\r\nConfederate side, and was author of the tactics first used by both\r\narmies.  Lieutenant Theodric Porter, of the 4th infantry, was killed\r\nwhile out with a small detachment; and Major Cross, the assistant\r\nquartermaster-general, had also been killed not far from camp.\r\n\r\nThere was no base of supplies nearer than Point Isabel, on the coast,\r\nnorth of the mouth of the Rio Grande and twenty-five miles away.  The\r\nenemy, if the Mexicans could be called such at this time when no war had\r\nbeen declared, hovered about in such numbers that it was not safe to\r\nsend a wagon train after supplies with any escort that could be spared.\r\nI have already said that General Taylor's whole command on the Rio\r\nGrande numbered less than three thousand men.  He had, however, a few\r\nmore troops at Point Isabel or Brazos Santiago.  The supplies brought\r\nfrom Corpus Christi in wagons were running short.  Work was therefore\r\npushed with great vigor on the defences, to enable the minimum number of\r\ntroops to hold the fort.  All the men who could be employed, were kept\r\nat work from early dawn until darkness closed the labors of the day.\r\nWith all this the fort was not completed until the supplies grew so\r\nshort that further delay in obtaining more could not be thought of.  By\r\nthe latter part of April the work was in a partially defensible\r\ncondition, and the 7th infantry, Major Jacob Brown commanding, was\r\nmarched in to garrison it, with some few pieces of artillery.  All the\r\nsupplies on hand, with the exception of enough to carry the rest of the\r\narmy to Point Isabel, were left with the garrison, and the march was\r\ncommenced with the remainder of the command, every wagon being taken\r\nwith the army.  Early on the second day after starting the force reached\r\nits destination, without opposition from the Mexicans.  There was some\r\ndelay in getting supplies ashore from vessels at anchor in the open\r\nroadstead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE MEXICAN WAR--THE BATTLE OF PALO ALTO--THE BATTLE OF RESACA DE LA\r\nPALMA--ARMY OF INVASION--GENERAL TAYLOR--MOVEMENT ON CAMARGO.\r\n\r\nWhile General Taylor was away with the bulk of his army, the little\r\ngarrison up the river was besieged.  As we lay in our tents upon the\r\nsea-shore, the artillery at the fort on the Rio Grande could be\r\ndistinctly heard.\r\n\r\nThe war had begun.\r\n\r\nThere were no possible means of obtaining news from the garrison, and\r\ninformation from outside could not be otherwise than unfavorable.  What\r\nGeneral Taylor's feelings were during this suspense I do not know; but\r\nfor myself, a young second-lieutenant who had never heard a hostile gun\r\nbefore, I felt sorry that I had enlisted.  A great many men, when they\r\nsmell battle afar off, chafe to get into the fray.  When they say so\r\nthemselves they generally fail to convince their hearers that they are\r\nas anxious as they would like to make believe, and as they approach\r\ndanger they become more subdued.  This rule is not universal, for I have\r\nknown a few men who were always aching for a fight when there was no\r\nenemy near, who were as good as their word when the battle did come.\r\nBut the number of such men is small.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of May the wagons were all loaded and General Taylor started\r\non his return, with his army reinforced at Point Isabel, but still less\r\nthan three thousand strong, to relieve the garrison on the Rio Grande.\r\nThe road from Point Isabel to Matamoras is over an open, rolling,\r\ntreeless prairie, until the timber that borders the bank of the Rio\r\nGrande is reached.  This river, like the Mississippi, flows through a\r\nrich alluvial valley in the most meandering manner, running towards all\r\npoints of the compass at times within a few miles.  Formerly the river\r\nran by Resaca de la Palma, some four or five miles east of the present\r\nchannel.  The old bed of the river at Resaca had become filled at\r\nplaces, leaving a succession of little lakes.  The timber that had\r\nformerly grown upon both banks, and for a considerable distance out, was\r\nstill standing.  This timber was struck six or eight miles out from the\r\nbesieged garrison, at a point known as Palo Alto--\"Tall trees\" or\r\n\"woods.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the forenoon of the 8th of May as Palo Alto was approached, an\r\narmy, certainly outnumbering our little force, was seen, drawn up in\r\nline of battle just in front of the timber.  Their bayonets and\r\nspearheads glistened in the sunlight formidably.  The force was composed\r\nlargely of cavalry armed with lances.  Where we were the grass was tall,\r\nreaching nearly to the shoulders of the men, very stiff, and each stock\r\nwas pointed at the top, and hard and almost as sharp as a\r\ndarning-needle. General Taylor halted his army before the head of column\r\ncame in range of the artillery of the Mexicans.  He then formed a line\r\nof battle, facing the enemy.  His artillery, two batteries and two\r\neighteen-pounder iron guns, drawn by oxen, were placed in position at\r\nintervals along the line.  A battalion was thrown to the rear, commanded\r\nby Lieutenant-Colonel Childs, of the artillery, as reserves.  These\r\npreparations completed, orders were given for a platoon of each company\r\nto stack arms and go to a stream off to the right of the command, to\r\nfill their canteens and also those of the rest of their respective\r\ncompanies.  When the men were all back in their places in line, the\r\ncommand to advance was given.  As I looked down that long line of about\r\nthree thousand armed men, advancing towards a larger force also armed,\r\nI thought what a fearful responsibility General Taylor must feel,\r\ncommanding such a host and so far away from friends.  The Mexicans\r\nimmediately opened fire upon us, first with artillery and then with\r\ninfantry.  At first their shots did not reach us, and the advance was\r\ncontinued.  As we got nearer, the cannon balls commenced going through\r\nthe ranks.  They hurt no one, however, during this advance, because they\r\nwould strike the ground long before they reached our line, and\r\nricochetted through the tall grass so slowly that the men would see them\r\nand open ranks and let them pass.  When we got to a point where the\r\nartillery could be used with effect, a halt was called, and the battle\r\nopened on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe infantry under General Taylor was armed with flint-lock muskets, and\r\npaper cartridges charged with powder, buck-shot and ball.  At the\r\ndistance of a few hundred yards a man might fire at you all day without\r\nyour finding it out.  The artillery was generally six-pounder brass guns\r\nthrowing only solid shot; but General Taylor had with him three or four\r\ntwelve-pounder howitzers throwing shell, besides his eighteen-pounders\r\nbefore spoken of, that had a long range.  This made a powerful armament.\r\nThe Mexicans were armed about as we were so far as their infantry was\r\nconcerned, but their artillery only fired solid shot.  We had greatly\r\nthe advantage in this arm.\r\n\r\nThe artillery was advanced a rod or two in front of the line, and opened\r\nfire.  The infantry stood at order arms as spectators, watching the\r\neffect of our shots upon the enemy, and watching his shots so as to step\r\nout of their way.  It could be seen that the eighteen-pounders and the\r\nhowitzers did a great deal of execution.  On our side there was little\r\nor no loss while we occupied this position.  During the battle Major\r\nRinggold, an accomplished and brave artillery officer, was mortally\r\nwounded, and Lieutenant Luther, also of the artillery, was struck.\r\nDuring the day several advances were made, and just at dusk it became\r\nevident that the Mexicans were falling back. We again advanced, and\r\noccupied at the close of the battle substantially the ground held by the\r\nenemy at the beginning.  In this last move there was a brisk fire upon\r\nour troops, and some execution was done.  One cannon-ball passed through\r\nour ranks, not far from me.  It took off the head of an enlisted man,\r\nand the under jaw of Captain Page of my regiment, while the splinters\r\nfrom the musket of the killed soldier, and his brains and bones, knocked\r\ndown two or three others, including one officer, Lieutenant Wallen,\r\n--hurting them more or less.  Our casualties for the day were nine killed\r\nand forty-seven wounded.\r\n\r\nAt the break of day on the 9th, the army under Taylor was ready to renew\r\nthe battle; but an advance showed that the enemy had entirely left our\r\nfront during the night.  The chaparral before us was impenetrable except\r\nwhere there were roads or trails, with occasionally clear or bare spots\r\nof small dimensions.  A body of men penetrating it might easily be\r\nambushed.  It was better to have a few men caught in this way than the\r\nwhole army, yet it was necessary that the garrison at the river should\r\nbe relieved.  To get to them the chaparral had to be passed.  Thus I\r\nassume General Taylor reasoned.  He halted the army not far in advance\r\nof the ground occupied by the Mexicans the day before, and selected\r\nCaptain C. F. Smith, of the artillery, and Captain McCall, of my\r\ncompany, to take one hundred and fifty picked men each and find where\r\nthe enemy had gone.  This left me in command of the company, an honor\r\nand responsibility I thought very great.\r\n\r\nSmith and McCall found no obstruction in the way of their advance until\r\nthey came up to the succession of ponds, before described, at Resaca.\r\nThe Mexicans had passed them and formed their lines on the opposite\r\nbank.  This position they had strengthened a little by throwing up dead\r\ntrees and brush in their front, and by placing artillery to cover the\r\napproaches and open places.  Smith and McCall deployed on each side of\r\nthe road as well as they could, and engaged the enemy at long range.\r\nWord was sent back, and the advance of the whole army was at once\r\ncommenced.  As we came up we were deployed in like manner.  I was with\r\nthe right wing, and led my company through the thicket wherever a\r\npenetrable place could be found, taking advantage of any clear spot that\r\nwould carry me towards the enemy.  At last I got pretty close up without\r\nknowing it.  The balls commenced to whistle very thick overhead, cutting\r\nthe limbs of the chaparral right and left.  We could not see the enemy,\r\nso I ordered my men to lie down, an order that did not have to be\r\nenforced.  We kept our position until it became evident that the enemy\r\nwere not firing at us, and then withdrew to find better ground to\r\nadvance upon.\r\n\r\nBy this time some progress had been made on our left.  A section of\r\nartillery had been captured by the cavalry, and some prisoners had been\r\ntaken.  The Mexicans were giving way all along the line, and many of\r\nthem had, no doubt, left early.  I at last found a clear space\r\nseparating two ponds.  There seemed to be a few men in front and I\r\ncharged upon them with my company.\r\n\r\nThere was no resistance, and we captured a Mexican colonel, who had been\r\nwounded, and a few men.  Just as I was sending them to the rear with a\r\nguard of two or three men, a private came from the front bringing back\r\none of our officers, who had been badly wounded in advance of where I\r\nwas.  The ground had been charged over before.  My exploit was equal to\r\nthat of the soldier who boasted that he had cut off the leg of one of\r\nthe enemy.  When asked why he did not cut off his head, he replied:\r\n\"Some one had done that before.\"  This left no doubt in my mind but that\r\nthe battle of Resaca de la Palma would have been won, just as it was, if\r\nI had not been there.  There was no further resistance. The evening of\r\nthe 9th the army was encamped on its old ground near the Fort, and the\r\ngarrison was relieved.  The siege had lasted a number of days, but the\r\ncasualties were few in number.  Major Jacob Brown, of the 7th infantry,\r\nthe commanding officer, had been killed, and in his honor the fort was\r\nnamed. Since then a town of considerable importance has sprung up on the\r\nground occupied by the fort and troops, which has also taken his name.\r\n\r\nThe battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma seemed to us engaged, as\r\npretty important affairs; but we had only a faint conception of their\r\nmagnitude until they were fought over in the North by the Press and the\r\nreports came back to us.  At the same time, or about the same time, we\r\nlearned that war existed between the United States and Mexico, by the\r\nacts of the latter country.  On learning this fact General Taylor\r\ntransferred our camps to the south or west bank of the river, and\r\nMatamoras was occupied.  We then became the \"Army of Invasion.\"\r\n\r\nUp to this time Taylor had none but regular troops in his command; but\r\nnow that invasion had already taken place, volunteers for one year\r\ncommenced arriving.  The army remained at Matamoras until sufficiently\r\nreinforced to warrant a movement into the interior.  General Taylor was\r\nnot an officer to trouble the administration much with his demands, but\r\nwas inclined to do the best he could with the means given him.  He felt\r\nhis responsibility as going no further.  If he had thought that he was\r\nsent to perform an impossibility with the means given him, he would\r\nprobably have informed the authorities of his opinion and left them to\r\ndetermine what should be done.  If the judgment was against him he would\r\nhave gone on and done the best he could with the means at hand without\r\nparading his grievance before the public.  No soldier could face either\r\ndanger or responsibility more calmly than he.  These are qualities more\r\nrarely found than genius or physical courage.\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor never made any great show or parade, either of uniform or\r\nretinue.  In dress he was possibly too plain, rarely wearing anything in\r\nthe field to indicate his rank, or even that he was an officer; but he\r\nwas known to every soldier in his army, and was respected by all.  I can\r\ncall to mind only one instance when I saw him in uniform, and one other\r\nwhen I heard of his wearing it, On both occasions he was unfortunate.\r\nThe first was at Corpus Christi.  He had concluded to review his army\r\nbefore starting on the march and gave orders accordingly.  Colonel\r\nTwiggs was then second in rank with the army, and to him was given the\r\ncommand of the review.  Colonel and Brevet Brigadier-General Worth, a\r\nfar different soldier from Taylor in the use of the uniform, was next to\r\nTwiggs in rank, and claimed superiority by virtue of his brevet rank\r\nwhen the accidents of service threw them where one or the other had to\r\ncommand.  Worth declined to attend the review as subordinate to Twiggs\r\nuntil the question was settled by the highest authority.  This broke up\r\nthe review, and the question was referred to Washington for final\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor was himself only a colonel, in real rank, at that time,\r\nand a brigadier-general by brevet.  He was assigned to duty, however, by\r\nthe President, with the rank which his brevet gave him.  Worth was not\r\nso assigned, but by virtue of commanding a division he must, under the\r\narmy regulations of that day, have drawn the pay of his brevet rank.\r\nThe question was submitted to Washington, and no response was received\r\nuntil after the army had reached the Rio Grande.  It was decided against\r\nGeneral Worth, who at once tendered his resignation and left the army,\r\ngoing north, no doubt, by the same vessel that carried it.  This kept\r\nhim out of the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.  Either the\r\nresignation was not accepted, or General Worth withdrew it before action\r\nhad been taken.  At all events he returned to the army in time to\r\ncommand his division in the battle of Monterey, and served with it to\r\nthe end of the war.\r\n\r\nThe second occasion on which General Taylor was said to have donned his\r\nuniform, was in order to receive a visit from the Flag Officer of the\r\nnaval squadron off the mouth of the Rio Grande.  While the army was on\r\nthat river the Flag Officer sent word that he would call on the General\r\nto pay his respects on a certain day.  General Taylor, knowing that\r\nnaval officers habitually wore all the uniform the \"law allowed\" on all\r\noccasions of ceremony, thought it would be only civil to receive his\r\nguest in the same style.  His uniform was therefore got out, brushed up,\r\nand put on, in advance of the visit.  The Flag Officer, knowing General\r\nTaylor's aversion to the wearing of the uniform, and feeling that it\r\nwould be regarded as a compliment should he meet him in civilian's\r\ndress, left off his uniform for this occasion.  The meeting was said to\r\nhave been embarrassing to both, and the conversation was principally\r\napologetic.\r\n\r\nThe time was whiled away pleasantly enough at Matamoras, while we were\r\nwaiting for volunteers.  It is probable that all the most important\r\npeople of the territory occupied by our army left their homes before we\r\ngot there, but with those remaining the best of relations apparently\r\nexisted.  It was the policy of the Commanding General to allow no\r\npillaging, no taking of private property for public or individual use\r\nwithout satisfactory compensation, so that a better market was afforded\r\nthan the people had ever known before.\r\n\r\nAmong the troops that joined us at Matamoras was an Ohio regiment, of\r\nwhich Thomas L. Hamer, the Member of Congress who had given me my\r\nappointment to West Point, was major.  He told me then that he could\r\nhave had the colonelcy, but that as he knew he was to be appointed a\r\nbrigadier-general, he preferred at first to take the lower grade.  I\r\nhave said before that Hamer was one of the ablest men Ohio ever\r\nproduced.  At that time he was in the prime of life, being less than\r\nfifty years of age, and possessed an admirable physique, promising long\r\nlife.  But he was taken sick before Monterey, and died within a few\r\ndays.  I have always believed that had his life been spared, he would\r\nhave been President of the United States during the term filled by\r\nPresident Pierce.  Had Hamer filled that office his partiality for me\r\nwas such, there is but little doubt I should have been appointed to one\r\nof the staff corps of the army--the Pay Department probably--and would\r\ntherefore now be preparing to retire.  Neither of these speculations is\r\nunreasonable, and they are mentioned to show how little men control\r\ntheir own destiny.\r\n\r\nReinforcements having arrived, in the month of August the movement\r\ncommenced from Matamoras to Camargo, the head of navigation on the Rio\r\nGrande.  The line of the Rio Grande was all that was necessary to hold,\r\nunless it was intended to invade Mexico from the North.  In that case\r\nthe most natural route to take was the one which General Taylor\r\nselected.  It entered a pass in the Sierra Madre Mountains, at Monterey,\r\nthrough which the main road runs to the City of Mexico.  Monterey itself\r\nwas a good point to hold, even if the line of the Rio Grande covered all\r\nthe territory we desired to occupy at that time.  It is built on a plain\r\ntwo thousand feet above tide water, where the air is bracing and the\r\nsituation healthy.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of August the army started for Monterey, leaving a small\r\ngarrison at Matamoras.  The troops, with the exception of the artillery,\r\ncavalry, and the brigade to which I belonged, were moved up the river to\r\nCamargo on steamers.  As there were but two or three of these, the boats\r\nhad to make a number of trips before the last of the troops were\r\nup. Those who marched did so by the south side of the river.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Garland, of the 4th infantry, was the brigade\r\ncommander, and on this occasion commanded the entire marching force.\r\nOne day out convinced him that marching by day in that latitude, in the\r\nmonth of August, was not a beneficial sanitary measure, particularly for\r\nNorthern men.  The order of marching was changed and night marches were\r\nsubstituted with the best results.\r\n\r\nWhen Camargo was reached, we found a city of tents outside the Mexican\r\nhamlet.  I was detailed to act as quartermaster and commissary to the\r\nregiment.  The teams that had proven abundantly sufficient to transport\r\nall supplies from Corpus Christi to the Rio Grande over the level\r\nprairies of Texas, were entirely inadequate to the needs of the\r\nreinforced army in a mountainous country.  To obviate the deficiency,\r\npack mules were hired, with Mexicans to pack and drive them.  I had\r\ncharge of the few wagons allotted to the 4th infantry and of the pack\r\ntrain to supplement them.  There were not men enough in the army to\r\nmanage that train without the help of Mexicans who had learned how.  As\r\nit was the difficulty was great enough.  The troops would take up their\r\nmarch at an early hour each day.  After they had started, the tents and\r\ncooking utensils had to be made into packages, so that they could be\r\nlashed to the backs of the mules.  Sheet-iron kettles, tent-poles and\r\nmess chests were inconvenient articles to transport in that way.  It\r\ntook several hours to get ready to start each morning, and by the time\r\nwe were ready some of the mules first loaded would be tired of standing\r\nso long with their loads on their backs. Sometimes one would start to\r\nrun, bowing his back and kicking up until he scattered his load; others\r\nwould lie down and try to disarrange their loads by attempting to get on\r\nthe top of them by rolling on them; others with tent-poles for part of\r\ntheir loads would manage to run a tent-pole on one side of a sapling\r\nwhile they would take the other.  I am not aware of ever having used a\r\nprofane expletive in my life; but I would have the charity to excuse\r\nthose who may have done so, if they were in charge of a train of Mexican\r\npack mules at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nADVANCE ON MONTEREY--THE BLACK FORT--THE BATTLE OF MONTEREY--SURRENDER\r\nOF THE CITY.\r\n\r\nThe advance from Camargo was commenced on the 5th of September. The army\r\nwas divided into four columns, separated from each other by one day's\r\nmarch.  The advance reached Cerralvo in four days and halted for the\r\nremainder of the troops to come up.  By the 13th the rear-guard had\r\narrived, and the same day the advance resumed its march, followed as\r\nbefore, a day separating the divisions.  The forward division halted\r\nagain at Marin, twenty-four miles from Monterey.  Both this place and\r\nCerralvo were nearly deserted, and men, women and children were seen\r\nrunning and scattered over the hills as we approached; but when the\r\npeople returned they found all their abandoned property safe, which must\r\nhave given them a favorable opinion of Los Grengos--\"the Yankees.\"  From\r\nMarin the movement was in mass. On the 19th General Taylor, with his\r\narmy, was encamped at Walnut Springs, within three miles of Monterey.\r\n\r\nThe town is on a small stream coming out of the mountain-pass, and is\r\nbacked by a range of hills of moderate elevation.  To the north, between\r\nthe city and Walnut Springs, stretches an extensive plain.  On this\r\nplain, and entirely outside of the last houses of the city, stood a\r\nstrong fort, enclosed on all sides, to which our army gave the name of\r\n\"Black Fort.\"  Its guns commanded the approaches to the city to the full\r\nextent of their range.  There were two detached spurs of hills or\r\nmountains to the north and northwest of the city, which were also\r\nfortified.  On one of these stood the Bishop's Palace.  The road to\r\nSaltillo leaves the upper or western end of the city under the fire of\r\nthe guns from these heights.  The lower or eastern end was defended by\r\ntwo or three small detached works, armed with artillery and infantry.\r\nTo the south was the mountain stream before mentioned, and back of that\r\nthe range of foot-hills.  The plaza in the centre of the city was the\r\ncitadel, properly speaking.  All the streets leading from it were swept\r\nby artillery, cannon being intrenched behind temporary parapets. The\r\nhouse-tops near the plaza were converted into infantry fortifications by\r\nthe use of sand-bags for parapets.  Such were the defences of Monterey\r\nin September, 1847.  General Ampudia, with a force of certainly ten\r\nthousand men, was in command.\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor's force was about six thousand five hundred strong, in\r\nthree divisions, under Generals Butler, Twiggs and Worth.  The troops\r\nwent into camp at Walnut Springs, while the engineer officers, under\r\nMajor Mansfield--a General in the late war--commenced their\r\nreconnoissance.  Major Mansfield found that it would be practicable to\r\nget troops around, out of range of the Black Fort and the works on the\r\ndetached hills to the north-west of the city, to the Saltillo road.\r\nWith this road in our possession, the enemy would be cut off from\r\nreceiving further supplies, if not from all communication with the\r\ninterior. General Worth, with his division somewhat reinforced, was\r\ngiven the task of gaining possession of the Saltillo road, and of\r\ncarrying the detached works outside the city, in that quarter. He\r\nstarted on his march early in the afternoon of the 20th.  The divisions\r\nunder Generals Butler and Twiggs were drawn up to threaten the east and\r\nnorth sides of the city and the works on those fronts, in support of the\r\nmovement under General Worth. Worth's was regarded as the main attack on\r\nMonterey, and all other operations were in support of it.  His march\r\nthis day was uninterrupted; but the enemy was seen to reinforce heavily\r\nabout the Bishop's Palace and the other outside fortifications on their\r\nleft.  General Worth reached a defensible position just out of range of\r\nthe enemy's guns on the heights north-west of the city, and bivouacked\r\nfor the night.  The engineer officers with him--Captain Sanders and\r\nLieutenant George G. Meade, afterwards the commander of the victorious\r\nNational army at the battle of Gettysburg--made a reconnoissance to the\r\nSaltillo road under cover of night.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 20th General Taylor had established a battery,\r\nconsisting of two twenty-four-pounder howitzers and a ten inch mortar,\r\nat a point from which they could play upon Black Fort.  A natural\r\ndepression in the plain, sufficiently deep to protect men standing in it\r\nfrom the fire from the fort, was selected and the battery established on\r\nthe crest nearest the enemy.  The 4th infantry, then consisting of but\r\nsix reduced companies, was ordered to support the artillerists while\r\nthey were intrenching themselves and their guns.  I was regimental\r\nquartermaster at the time and was ordered to remain in charge of camp\r\nand the public property at Walnut Springs.  It was supposed that the\r\nregiment would return to its camp in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe point for establishing the siege battery was reached and the work\r\nperformed without attracting the attention of the enemy.  At daylight\r\nthe next morning fire was opened on both sides and continued with, what\r\nseemed to me at that day, great fury.  My curiosity got the better of my\r\njudgment, and I mounted a horse and rode to the front to see what was\r\ngoing on.  I had been there but a short time when an order to charge was\r\ngiven, and lacking the moral courage to return to camp--where I had been\r\nordered to stay--I charged with the regiment As soon as the troops were\r\nout of the depression they came under the fire of Black Fort.  As they\r\nadvanced they got under fire from batteries guarding the east, or lower,\r\nend of the city, and of musketry. About one-third of the men engaged in\r\nthe charge were killed or wounded in the space of a few minutes.  We\r\nretreated to get out of fire, not backward, but eastward and\r\nperpendicular to the direct road running into the city from Walnut\r\nSprings.  I was, I believe, the only person in the 4th infantry in the\r\ncharge who was on horseback.  When we got to a lace of safety the\r\nregiment halted and drew itself together--what was left of it.  The\r\nadjutant of the regiment, Lieutenant Hoskins, who was not in robust\r\nhealth, found himself very much fatigued from running on foot in the\r\ncharge and retreat, and, seeing me on horseback, expressed a wish that\r\nhe could be mounted also.  I offered him my horse and he accepted the\r\noffer.  A few minutes later I saw a soldier, a quartermaster's man,\r\nmounted, not far away.  I ran to him, took his horse and was back with\r\nthe regiment in a few minutes.  In a short time we were off again; and\r\nthe next place of safety from the shots of the enemy that I recollect of\r\nbeing in, was a field of cane or corn to the north-east of the lower\r\nbatteries.  The adjutant to whom I had loaned my horse was killed, and I\r\nwas designated to act in his place.\r\n\r\nThis charge was ill-conceived, or badly executed.  We belonged to the\r\nbrigade commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Garland, and he had received\r\norders to charge the lower batteries of the city, and carry them if he\r\ncould without too much loss, for the purpose of creating a diversion in\r\nfavor of Worth, who was conducting the movement which it was intended\r\nshould be decisive.  By a movement by the left flank Garland could have\r\nled his men beyond the range of the fire from Black Fort and advanced\r\ntowards the northeast angle of the city, as well covered from fire as\r\ncould be expected.  There was no undue loss of life in reaching the\r\nlower end of Monterey, except that sustained by Garland's command.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Quitman's brigade, conducted by an officer of engineers, had\r\nreached the eastern end of the city, and was placed under cover of the\r\nhouses without much loss.  Colonel Garland's brigade also arrived at the\r\nsuburbs, and, by the assistance of some of our troops that had reached\r\nhouse-tops from which they could fire into a little battery covering the\r\napproaches to the lower end of the city, the battery was speedily\r\ncaptured and its guns were turned upon another work of the enemy.  An\r\nentrance into the east end of the city was now secured, and the houses\r\nprotected our troops so long as they were inactive.  On the west General\r\nWorth had reached the Saltillo road after some fighting but without\r\nheavy loss.  He turned from his new position and captured the forts on\r\nboth heights in that quarter.  This gave him possession of the upper or\r\nwest end of Monterey.  Troops from both Twiggs's and Butler's divisions\r\nwere in possession of the east end of the town, but the Black Fort to\r\nthe north of the town and the plaza in the centre were still in the\r\npossession of the enemy.  Our camps at Walnut Springs, three miles away,\r\nwere guarded by a company from each regiment.  A regiment of Kentucky\r\nvolunteers guarded the mortars and howitzers engaged against Black Fort.\r\nPractically Monterey was invested.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing done on the 22d by the United States troops; but the\r\nenemy kept up a harmless fire upon us from Black Fort and the batteries\r\nstill in their possession at the east end of the city.  During the night\r\nthey evacuated these; so that on the morning of the 23d we held\r\nundisputed possession of the east end of Monterey.\r\n\r\nTwiggs's division was at the lower end of the city, and well covered\r\nfrom the fire of the enemy.  But the streets leading to the plaza--all\r\nSpanish or Spanish-American towns have near their centres a square\r\ncalled a plaza--were commanded from all directions by artillery.  The\r\nhouses were flat-roofed and but one or two stories high, and about the\r\nplaza the roofs were manned with infantry, the troops being protected\r\nfrom our fire by parapets made of sand-bags.  All advances into the city\r\nwere thus attended with much danger.  While moving along streets which\r\ndid not lead to the plaza, our men were protected from the fire, and\r\nfrom the view, of the enemy except at the crossings; but at these a\r\nvolley of musketry and a discharge of grape-shot were invariably\r\nencountered.  The 3d and 4th regiments of infantry made an advance\r\nnearly to the plaza in this way and with heavy loss.  The loss of the 3d\r\ninfantry in commissioned officers was especially severe.  There were\r\nonly five companies of the regiment and not over twelve officers\r\npresent, and five of these officers were killed.  When within a square\r\nof the plaza this small command, ten companies in all, was brought to a\r\nhalt.  Placing themselves under cover from the shots of the enemy, the\r\nmen would watch to detect a head above the sand-bags on the neighboring\r\nhouses.  The exposure of a single head would bring a volley from our\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nWe had not occupied this position long when it was discovered that our\r\nammunition was growing low.  I volunteered to go back (*2) to the point\r\nwe had started from, report our position to General Twiggs, and ask for\r\nammunition to be forwarded.  We were at this time occupying ground off\r\nfrom the street, in rear of the houses.  My ride back was an exposed\r\none.  Before starting I adjusted myself on the side of my horse furthest\r\nfrom the enemy, and with only one foot holding to the cantle of the\r\nsaddle, and an arm over the neck of the horse exposed, I started at full\r\nrun.  It was only at street crossings that my horse was under fire, but\r\nthese I crossed at such a flying rate that generally I was past and\r\nunder cover of the next block of houses before the enemy fired.  I got\r\nout safely without a scratch.\r\n\r\nAt one place on my ride, I saw a sentry walking in front of a house, and\r\nstopped to inquire what he was doing there.  Finding that the house was\r\nfull of wounded American officers and soldiers, I dismounted and went\r\nin.  I found there Captain Williams, of the Engineer Corps, wounded in\r\nthe head, probably fatally, and Lieutenant Territt, also badly wounded\r\nhis bowels protruding from his wound.  There were quite a number of\r\nsoldiers also.  Promising them to report their situation, I left,\r\nreadjusted myself to my horse, recommenced the run, and was soon with\r\nthe troops at the east end.  Before ammunition could be collected, the\r\ntwo regiments I had been with were seen returning, running the same\r\ngauntlet in getting out that they had passed in going in, but with\r\ncomparatively little loss.  The movement was countermanded and the\r\ntroops were withdrawn.  The poor wounded officers and men I had found,\r\nfell into the hands of the enemy during the night, and died.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on at the east, General Worth, with a small\r\ndivision of troops, was advancing towards the plaza from the opposite\r\nend of the city.  He resorted to a better expedient for getting to the\r\nplaza--the citadel--than we did on the east. Instead of moving by the\r\nopen streets, he advanced through the houses, cutting passageways from\r\none to another.  Without much loss of life, he got so near the plaza\r\nduring the night that before morning, Ampudia, the Mexican commander,\r\nmade overtures for the surrender of the city and garrison.  This stopped\r\nall further hostilities.  The terms of surrender were soon agreed upon.\r\nThe prisoners were paroled and permitted to take their horses and\r\npersonal property with them.\r\n\r\nMy pity was aroused by the sight of the Mexican garrison of Monterey\r\nmarching out of town as prisoners, and no doubt the same feeling was\r\nexperienced by most of our army who witnessed it.  Many of the prisoners\r\nwere cavalry, armed with lances, and mounted on miserable little\r\nhalf-starved horses that did not look as if they could carry their\r\nriders out of town.  The men looked in but little better condition.  I\r\nthought how little interest the men before me had in the results of the\r\nwar, and how little knowledge they had of \"what it was all about.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of the garrison of Monterey a quiet camp life was\r\nled until midwinter.  As had been the case on the Rio Grande, the people\r\nwho remained at their homes fraternized with the \"Yankees\" in the\r\npleasantest manner.  In fact, under the humane policy of our commander,\r\nI question whether the great majority of the Mexican people did not\r\nregret our departure as much as they had regretted our coming.  Property\r\nand person were thoroughly protected, and a market was afforded for all\r\nthe products of the country such as the people had never enjoyed before.\r\nThe educated and wealthy portion of the population here, as elsewhere,\r\nabandoned their homes and remained away from them as long as they were\r\nin the possession of the invaders; but this class formed a very small\r\npercentage of the whole population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL INTRIGUE--BUENA VISTA--MOVEMENT AGAINST VERA CRUZ--SIEGE AND\r\nCAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican war was a political war, and the administration conducting\r\nit desired to make party capital out of it.  General Scott was at the\r\nhead of the army, and, being a soldier of acknowledged professional\r\ncapacity, his claim to the command of the forces in the field was almost\r\nindisputable and does not seem to have been denied by President Polk, or\r\nMarcy, his Secretary of War.  Scott was a Whig and the administration\r\nwas democratic.  General Scott was also known to have political\r\naspirations, and nothing so popularizes a candidate for high civil\r\npositions as military victories.  It would not do therefore to give him\r\ncommand of the \"army of conquest.\"  The plans submitted by Scott for a\r\ncampaign in Mexico were disapproved by the administration, and he\r\nreplied, in a tone possibly a little disrespectful, to the effect that,\r\nif a soldier's plans were not to be supported by the administration,\r\nsuccess could not be expected.  This was on the 27th of May, 1846.  Four\r\ndays later General Scott was notified that he need not go to Mexico.\r\nGeneral Gaines was next in rank, but he was too old and feeble to take\r\nthe field.  Colonel Zachary Taylor--a brigadier-general by brevet--was\r\ntherefore left in command.  He, too, was a Whig, but was not supposed to\r\nentertain any political ambitions; nor did he; but after the fall of\r\nMonterey, his third battle and third complete victory, the Whig papers\r\nat home began to speak of him as the candidate of their party for the\r\nPresidency.  Something had to be done to neutralize his growing\r\npopularity.  He could not be relieved from duty in the field where all\r\nhis battles had been victories:  the design would have been too\r\ntransparent.  It was finally decided to send General Scott to Mexico in\r\nchief command, and to authorize him to carry out his own original plan:\r\nthat is, capture Vera Cruz and march upon the capital of the country.\r\nIt was no doubt supposed that Scott's ambition would lead him to\r\nslaughter Taylor or destroy his chances for the Presidency, and yet it\r\nwas hoped that he would not make sufficient capital himself to secure\r\nthe prize.\r\n\r\nThe administration had indeed a most embarrassing problem to solve.  It\r\nwas engaged in a war of conquest which must be carried to a successful\r\nissue, or the political object would be unattained.  Yet all the capable\r\nofficers of the requisite rank belonged to the opposition, and the man\r\nselected for his lack of political ambition had himself become a\r\nprominent candidate for the Presidency.  It was necessary to destroy his\r\nchances promptly.  The problem was to do this without the loss of\r\nconquest and without permitting another general of the same political\r\nparty to acquire like popularity.  The fact is, the administration of\r\nMr. Polk made every preparation to disgrace Scott, or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, to drive him to such desperation that he would disgrace\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott had opposed conquest by the way of the Rio Grande,\r\nMatamoras and Saltillo from the first.  Now that he was in command of\r\nall the forces in Mexico, he withdrew from Taylor most of his regular\r\ntroops and left him only enough volunteers, as he thought, to hold the\r\nline then in possession of the invading army.  Indeed Scott did not deem\r\nit important to hold anything beyond the Rio Grande, and authorized\r\nTaylor to fall back to that line if he chose.  General Taylor protested\r\nagainst the depletion of his army, and his subsequent movement upon\r\nBuena Vista would indicate that he did not share the views of his chief\r\nin regard to the unimportance of conquest beyond the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nScott had estimated the men and material that would be required to\r\ncapture Vera Cruz and to march on the capital of the country, two\r\nhundred and sixty miles in the interior.  He was promised all he asked\r\nand seemed to have not only the confidence of the President, but his\r\nsincere good wishes.  The promises were all broken.  Only about half the\r\ntroops were furnished that had been pledged, other war material was\r\nwithheld and Scott had scarcely started for Mexico before the President\r\nundertook to supersede him by the appointment of Senator Thomas H.\r\nBenton as lieutenant-general.  This being refused by Congress, the\r\nPresident asked legislative authority to place a junior over a senior of\r\nthe same grade, with the view of appointing Benton to the rank of\r\nmajor-general and then placing him in command of the army, but Congress\r\nfailed to accede to this proposition as well, and Scott remained in\r\ncommand: but every general appointed to serve under him was politically\r\nopposed to the chief, and several were personally hostile.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott reached Brazos Santiago or Point Isabel, at the mouth of\r\nthe Rio Grande, late in December, 1846, and proceeded at once up the\r\nriver to Camargo, where he had written General Taylor to meet him.\r\nTaylor, however, had gone to, or towards Tampico, for the purpose of\r\nestablishing a post there.  He had started on this march before he was\r\naware of General Scott being in the country.  Under these circumstances\r\nScott had to issue his orders designating the troops to be withdrawn\r\nfrom Taylor, without the personal consultation he had expected to hold\r\nwith his subordinate.\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor's victory at Buena Vista, February 22d, 23d, and 24th,\r\n1847, with an army composed almost entirely of volunteers who had not\r\nbeen in battle before, and over a vastly superior force numerically,\r\nmade his nomination for the Presidency by the Whigs a foregone\r\nconclusion.  He was nominated and elected in 1848.  I believe that he\r\nsincerely regretted this turn in his fortunes, preferring the peace\r\nafforded by a quiet life free from abuse to the honor of filling the\r\nhighest office in the gift of any people, the Presidency of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWhen General Scott assumed command of the army of invasion, I was in the\r\ndivision of General David Twiggs, in Taylor's command; but under the new\r\norders my regiment was transferred to the division of General William\r\nWorth, in which I served to the close of the war.  The troops withdrawn\r\nfrom Taylor to form part of the forces to operate against Vera Cruz,\r\nwere assembled at the mouth of the Rio Grande preparatory to embarkation\r\nfor their destination.  I found General Worth a different man from any I\r\nhad before served directly under.  He was nervous, impatient and\r\nrestless on the march, or when important or responsible duty confronted\r\nhim.  There was not the least reason for haste on the march, for it was\r\nknown that it would take weeks to assemble shipping enough at the point\r\nof our embarkation to carry the army, but General Worth moved his\r\ndivision with a rapidity that would have been commendable had he been\r\ngoing to the relief of a beleaguered garrison.  The length of the\r\nmarches was regulated by the distances between places affording a supply\r\nof water for the troops, and these distances were sometimes long and\r\nsometimes short.  General Worth on one occasion at least, after having\r\nmade the full distance intended for the day, and after the troops were\r\nin camp and preparing their food, ordered tents struck and made the\r\nmarch that night which had been intended for the next day.  Some\r\ncommanders can move troops so as to get the maximum distance out of them\r\nwithout fatigue, while others can wear them out in a few days without\r\naccomplishing so much. General Worth belonged to this latter class.  He\r\nenjoyed, however, a fine reputation for his fighting qualities, and thus\r\nattached his officers and men to him.\r\n\r\nThe army lay in camp upon the sand-beach in the neighborhood of the\r\nmouth of the Rio Grande for several weeks, awaiting the arrival of\r\ntransports to carry it to its new field of operations.  The transports\r\nwere all sailing vessels.  The passage was a tedious one, and many of\r\nthe troops were on shipboard over thirty days from the embarkation at\r\nthe mouth of the Rio Grande to the time of debarkation south of Vera\r\nCruz. The trip was a comfortless one for officers and men.  The\r\ntransports used were built for carrying freight and possessed but\r\nlimited accommodations for passengers, and the climate added to the\r\ndiscomfort of all.\r\n\r\nThe transports with troops were assembled in the harbor of Anton\r\nLizardo, some sixteen miles south of Vera Cruz, as they arrived, and\r\nthere awaited the remainder of the fleet, bringing artillery, ammunition\r\nand supplies of all kinds from the North.  With the fleet there was a\r\nlittle steam propeller dispatch-boat--the first vessel of the kind I had\r\never seen, and probably the first of its kind ever seen by any one then\r\nwith the army.  At that day ocean steamers were rare, and what there\r\nwere were sidewheelers.  This little vessel, going through the fleet so\r\nfast, so noiselessly and with its propeller under water out of view,\r\nattracted a great deal of attention.  I recollect that Lieutenant Sidney\r\nSmith, of the 4th infantry, by whom I happened to be standing on the\r\ndeck of a vessel when this propeller was passing, exclaimed, \"Why, the\r\nthing looks as if it was propelled by the force of circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nFinally on the 7th of March, 1847, the little army of ten or twelve\r\nthousand men, given Scott to invade a country with a population of seven\r\nor eight millions, a mountainous country affording the greatest possible\r\nnatural advantages for defence, was all assembled and ready to commence\r\nthe perilous task of landing from vessels lying in the open sea.\r\n\r\nThe debarkation took place inside of the little island of Sacrificios,\r\nsome three miles south of Vera Cruz.  The vessels could not get anywhere\r\nnear shore, so that everything had to be landed in lighters or\r\nsurf-boats; General Scott had provided these before leaving the North.\r\nThe breakers were sometimes high, so that the landing was tedious.  The\r\nmen were got ashore rapidly, because they could wade when they came to\r\nshallow water; but the camp and garrison equipage, provisions,\r\nammunition and all stores had to be protected from the salt water, and\r\ntherefore their landing took several days.  The Mexicans were very kind\r\nto us, however, and threw no obstacles in the way of our landing except\r\nan occasional shot from their nearest fort.  During the debarkation one\r\nshot took off the head of Major Albertis.  No other, I believe, reached\r\nanywhere near the same distance.  On the 9th of March the troops were\r\nlanded and the investment of Vera Cruz, from the Gulf of Mexico south of\r\nthe city to the Gulf again on the north, was soon and easily effected.\r\nThe landing of stores was continued until everything was got ashore.\r\n\r\nVera Cruz, at the time of which I write and up to 1880, was a walled\r\ncity.  The wall extended from the water's edge south of the town to the\r\nwater again on the north.  There were fortifications at intervals along\r\nthe line and at the angles. In front of the city, and on an island half\r\na mile out in the Gulf, stands San Juan de Ulloa, an enclosed\r\nfortification of large dimensions and great strength for that period.\r\nAgainst artillery of the present day the land forts and walls would\r\nprove elements of weakness rather than strength.  After the invading\r\narmy had established their camps out of range of the fire from the city,\r\nbatteries were established, under cover of night, far to the front of\r\nthe line where the troops lay.  These batteries were intrenched and the\r\napproaches sufficiently protected.  If a sortie had been made at any\r\ntime by the Mexicans, the men serving the batteries could have been\r\nquickly reinforced without great exposure to the fire from the enemy's\r\nmain line.  No serious attempt was made to capture the batteries or to\r\ndrive our troops away.\r\n\r\nThe siege continued with brisk firing on our side till the 27th of\r\nMarch, by which time a considerable breach had been made in the wall\r\nsurrounding the city.  Upon this General Morales, who was Governor of\r\nboth the city and of San Juan de Ulloa, commenced a correspondence with\r\nGeneral Scott looking to the surrender of the town, forts and garrison.\r\nOn the 29th Vera Cruz and San Juan de Ulloa were occupied by Scott's\r\narmy.  About five thousand prisoners and four hundred pieces of\r\nartillery, besides large amounts of small arms and ammunition, fell into\r\nthe hands of the victorious force.  The casualties on our side during\r\nthe siege amounted to sixty-four officers and men, killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMARCH TO JALAPA--BATTLE OF CERRO GORDO--PEROTE--PUEBLA--SCOTT AND\r\nTAYLOR.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott had less than twelve thousand men at Vera Cruz. He had\r\nbeen promised by the administration a very much larger force, or claimed\r\nthat he had, and he was a man of veracity. Twelve thousand was a very\r\nsmall army with which to penetrate two hundred and sixty miles into an\r\nenemy's country, and to besiege the capital; a city, at that time, of\r\nlargely over one hundred thousand inhabitants.  Then, too, any line of\r\nmarch that could be selected led through mountain passes easily\r\ndefended. In fact, there were at that time but two roads from Vera Cruz\r\nto the City of Mexico that could be taken by an army; one by Jalapa and\r\nPerote, the other by Cordova and Orizaba, the two coming together on the\r\ngreat plain which extends to the City of Mexico after the range of\r\nmountains is passed.\r\n\r\nIt was very important to get the army away from Vera Cruz as soon as\r\npossible, in order to avoid the yellow fever, or vomito, which usually\r\nvisits that city early in the year, and is very fatal to persons not\r\nacclimated; but transportation, which was expected from the North, was\r\narriving very slowly.  It was absolutely necessary to have enough to\r\nsupply the army to Jalapa, sixty-five miles in the interior and above\r\nthe fevers of the coast.  At that point the country is fertile, and an\r\narmy of the size of General Scott's could subsist there for an\r\nindefinite period.  Not counting the sick, the weak and the garrisons\r\nfor the captured city and fort, the moving column was now less than ten\r\nthousand strong.  This force was composed of three divisions, under\r\nGenerals Twiggs, Patterson, and Worth. The importance of escaping the\r\nvomito was so great that as soon as transportation enough could be got\r\ntogether to move a division the advance was commenced.  On the 8th of\r\nApril, Twiggs's division started for Jalapa.  He was followed very soon\r\nby Patterson, with his division.  General Worth was to bring up the rear\r\nwith his command as soon as transportation enough was assembled to carry\r\nsix days' rations for his troops with the necessary ammunition and camp\r\nand garrison equipage.  It was the 13th of April before this division\r\nleft Vera Cruz.\r\n\r\nThe leading division ran against the enemy at Cerro Gordo, some fifty\r\nmiles west, on the road to Jalapa, and went into camp at Plan del Rio,\r\nabout three miles from the fortifications. General Patterson reached\r\nPlan del Rio with his division soon after Twiggs arrived.  The two were\r\nthen secure against an attack from Santa Anna, who commanded the Mexican\r\nforces.  At all events they confronted the enemy without reinforcements\r\nand without molestation, until the 18th of April.  General Scott had\r\nremained at Vera Cruz to hasten preparations for the field; but on the\r\n12th, learning the situation at the front, he hastened on to take\r\npersonal supervision.  He at once commenced his preparations for the\r\ncapture of the position held by Santa Anna and of the troops holding it.\r\n\r\nCerro Gordo is one of the higher spurs of the mountains some twelve to\r\nfifteen miles east of Jalapa, and Santa Anna had selected this point as\r\nthe easiest to defend against an invading army.  The road, said to have\r\nbeen built by Cortez, zigzags around the mountain-side and was defended\r\nat every turn by artillery.  On either side were deep chasms or mountain\r\nwalls. A direct attack along the road was an impossibility.  A flank\r\nmovement seemed equally impossible.  After the arrival of the\r\ncommanding-general upon the scene, reconnoissances were sent out to\r\nfind, or to make, a road by which the rear of the enemy's works might be\r\nreached without a front attack.  These reconnoissances were made under\r\nthe supervision of Captain Robert E. Lee, assisted by Lieutenants P. G.\r\nT. Beauregard, Isaac I. Stevens, Z. B. Tower, G. W. Smith, George B.\r\nMcClellan, and J. G. Foster, of the corps of engineers, all officers who\r\nattained rank and fame, on one side or the other, in the great conflict\r\nfor the preservation of the unity of the nation.  The reconnoissance was\r\ncompleted, and the labor of cutting out and making roads by the flank of\r\nthe enemy was effected by the 17th of the month.  This was accomplished\r\nwithout the knowledge of Santa Anna or his army, and over ground where\r\nhe supposed it impossible.  On the same day General Scott issued his\r\norder for the attack on the 18th.\r\n\r\nThe attack was made as ordered, and perhaps there was not a battle of\r\nthe Mexican war, or of any other, where orders issued before an\r\nengagement were nearer being a correct report of what afterwards took\r\nplace.  Under the supervision of the engineers, roadways had been opened\r\nover chasms to the right where the walls were so steep that men could\r\nbarely climb them.  Animals could not.  These had been opened under\r\ncover of night, without attracting the notice of the enemy.  The\r\nengineers, who had directed the opening, led the way and the troops\r\nfollowed. Artillery was let down the steep slopes by hand, the men\r\nengaged attaching a strong rope to the rear axle and letting the guns\r\ndown, a piece at a time, while the men at the ropes kept their ground on\r\ntop, paying out gradually, while a few at the front directed the course\r\nof the piece.  In like manner the guns were drawn by hand up the\r\nopposite slopes.  In this way Scott's troops reached their assigned\r\nposition in rear of most of the intrenchments of the enemy, unobserved.\r\nThe attack was made, the Mexican reserves behind the works beat a hasty\r\nretreat, and those occupying them surrendered.  On the left General\r\nPillow's command made a formidable demonstration, which doubtless held a\r\npart of the enemy in his front and contributed to the victory. I am not\r\npretending to give full details of all the battles fought, but of the\r\nportion that I saw.  There were troops engaged on both sides at other\r\npoints in which both sustained losses; but the battle was won as here\r\nnarrated.\r\n\r\nThe surprise of the enemy was complete, the victory overwhelming; some\r\nthree thousand prisoners fell into Scott's hands, also a large amount of\r\nordnance and ordnance stores.  The prisoners were paroled, the artillery\r\nparked and the small arms and ammunition destroyed.  The battle of Buena\r\nVista was probably very important to the success of General Scott at\r\nCerro Gordo and in his entire campaign from Vera Cruz to the great\r\nplains reaching to the City of Mexico.  The only army Santa Anna had to\r\nprotect his capital and the mountain passes west of Vera Cruz, was the\r\none he had with him confronting General Taylor. It is not likely that he\r\nwould have gone as far north as Monterey to attack the United States\r\ntroops when he knew his country was threatened with invasion further\r\nsouth.  When Taylor moved to Saltillo and then advanced on to Buena\r\nVista, Santa Anna crossed the desert confronting the invading army,\r\nhoping no doubt to crush it and get back in time to meet General Scott\r\nin the mountain passes west of Vera Cruz.  His attack on Taylor was\r\ndisastrous to the Mexican army, but, notwithstanding this, he marched\r\nhis army to Cerro Gordo, a distance not much short of one thousand miles\r\nby the line he had to travel, in time to intrench himself well before\r\nScott got there.  If he had been successful at Buena Vista his troops\r\nwould no doubt have made a more stubborn resistance at Cerro Gordo.  Had\r\nthe battle of Buena Vista not been fought Santa Anna would have had time\r\nto move leisurely to meet the invader further south and with an army not\r\ndemoralized nor depleted by defeat.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle the victorious army moved on to Jalapa, where it was in\r\na beautiful, productive and healthy country, far above the fevers of the\r\ncoast.  Jalapa, however, is still in the mountains, and between there\r\nand the great plain the whole line of the road is easy of defence.  It\r\nwas important, therefore, to get possession of the great highway between\r\nthe sea-coast and the capital up to the point where it leaves the\r\nmountains, before the enemy could have time to re-organize and fortify\r\nin our front. Worth's division was selected to go forward to secure this\r\nresult.  The division marched to Perote on the great plain, not far from\r\nwhere the road debouches from the mountains.  There is a low, strong\r\nfort on the plain in front of the town, known as the Castle of Perote.\r\nThis, however, offered no resistance and fell into our hands, with its\r\narmament.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott having now only nine or ten thousand men west of Vera\r\nCruz, and the time of some four thousand of them being about to expire,\r\na long delay was the consequence.  The troops were in a healthy climate,\r\nand where they could subsist for an indefinite period even if their line\r\nback to Vera Cruz should be cut off.  It being ascertained that the men\r\nwhose time would expire before the City of Mexico could possibly fall\r\ninto the hands of the American army, would not remain beyond the term\r\nfor which they had volunteered, the commanding-general determined to\r\ndischarge them at once, for a delay until the expiration of their time\r\nwould have compelled them to pass through Vera Cruz during the season of\r\nthe vomito.  This reduced Scott's force in the field to about five\r\nthousand men.\r\n\r\nEarly in May, Worth, with his division, left Perote and marched on to\r\nPuebla.  The roads were wide and the country open except through one\r\npass in a spur of mountains coming up from the south, through which the\r\nroad runs.  Notwithstanding this the small column was divided into two\r\nbodies, moving a day apart. Nothing occurred on the march of special\r\nnote, except that while lying at the town of Amozoque--an easy day's\r\nmarch east of Puebla--a body of the enemy's cavalry, two or three\r\nthousand strong, was seen to our right, not more than a mile away.  A\r\nbattery or two, with two or three infantry regiments, was sent against\r\nthem and they soon disappeared.  On the 15th of May we entered the city\r\nof Puebla.\r\n\r\nGeneral Worth was in command at Puebla until the latter end of May, when\r\nGeneral Scott arrived.  Here, as well as on the march up, his\r\nrestlessness, particularly under responsibilities, showed itself.\r\nDuring his brief command he had the enemy hovering around near the city,\r\nin vastly superior numbers to his own.  The brigade to which I was\r\nattached changed quarters three different times in about a week,\r\noccupying at first quarters near the plaza, in the heart of the city;\r\nthen at the western entrance; then at the extreme east.  On one occasion\r\nGeneral Worth had the troops in line, under arms, all day, with three\r\ndays' cooked rations in their haversacks.  He galloped from one command\r\nto another proclaiming the near proximity of Santa Anna with an army\r\nvastly superior to his own.  General Scott arrived upon the scene the\r\nlatter part of the month, and nothing more was heard of Santa Anna and\r\nhis myriads.  There were, of course, bodies of mounted Mexicans hovering\r\naround to watch our movements and to pick up stragglers, or small bodies\r\nof troops, if they ventured too far out.  These always withdrew on the\r\napproach of any considerable number of our soldiers.  After the arrival\r\nof General Scott I was sent, as quartermaster, with a large train of\r\nwagons, back two days' march at least, to procure forage.  We had less\r\nthan a thousand men as escort, and never thought of danger.  We procured\r\nfull loads for our entire train at two plantations, which could easily\r\nhave furnished as much more.\r\n\r\nThere had been great delay in obtaining the authority of Congress for\r\nthe raising of the troops asked for by the administration.  A bill was\r\nbefore the National Legislature from early in the session of 1846-7,\r\nauthorizing the creation of ten additional regiments for the war to be\r\nattached to the regular army, but it was the middle of February before\r\nit became a law.  Appointments of commissioned officers had then to be\r\nmade; men had to be enlisted, the regiments equipped and the whole\r\ntransported to Mexico.  It was August before General Scott received\r\nreinforcement sufficient to warrant an advance.  His moving column, not\r\neven now more than ten thousand strong, was in four divisions, commanded\r\nby Generals Twiggs, Worth, Pillow and Quitman.  There was also a cavalry\r\ncorps under General Harney, composed of detachments of the 1st, 2d, and\r\n3d dragoons.  The advance commenced on the 7th of August with Twiggs's\r\ndivision in front.  The remaining three divisions followed, with an\r\ninterval of a day between.  The marches were short, to make\r\nconcentration easier in case of attack.\r\n\r\nI had now been in battle with the two leading commanders conducting\r\narmies in a foreign land.  The contrast between the two was very marked.\r\nGeneral Taylor never wore uniform, but dressed himself entirely for\r\ncomfort.  He moved about the field in which he was operating to see\r\nthrough his own eyes the situation.  Often he would be without staff\r\nofficers, and when he was accompanied by them there was no prescribed\r\norder in which they followed.  He was very much given to sit his horse\r\nside-ways--with both feet on one side--particularly on the battlefield.\r\nGeneral Scott was the reverse in all these particulars.  He always wore\r\nall the uniform prescribed or allowed by law when he inspected his\r\nlines; word would be sent to all division and brigade commanders in\r\nadvance, notifying them of the hour when the commanding general might be\r\nexpected.  This was done so that all the army might be under arms to\r\nsalute their chief as he passed.  On these occasions he wore his dress\r\nuniform, cocked hat, aiguillettes, sabre and spurs.  His staff proper,\r\nbesides all officers constructively on his staff--engineers, inspectors,\r\nquartermasters, etc., that could be spared--followed, also in uniform\r\nand in prescribed order.  Orders were prepared with great care and\r\nevidently with the view that they should be a history of what followed.\r\n\r\nIn their modes of expressing thought, these two generals contrasted\r\nquite as strongly as in their other characteristics.  General Scott was\r\nprecise in language, cultivated a style peculiarly his own; was proud of\r\nhis rhetoric; not averse to speaking of himself, often in the third\r\nperson, and he could bestow praise upon the person he was talking about\r\nwithout the least embarrassment.  Taylor was not a conversationalist,\r\nbut on paper he could put his meaning so plainly that there could be no\r\nmistaking it.  He knew how to express what he wanted to say in the\r\nfewest well-chosen words, but would not sacrifice meaning to the\r\nconstruction of high-sounding sentences.  But with their opposite\r\ncharacteristics both were great and successful soldiers; both were true,\r\npatriotic and upright in all their dealings.  Both were pleasant to\r\nserve under--Taylor was pleasant to serve with.  Scott saw more through\r\nthe eyes of his staff officers than through his own.  His plans were\r\ndeliberately prepared, and fully expressed in orders.  Taylor saw for\r\nhimself, and gave orders to meet the emergency without reference to how\r\nthey would read in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nADVANCE ON THE CITY OF MEXICO--BATTLE OF CONTRERAS--ASSAULT AT\r\nCHURUBUSCO--NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE--BATTLE OF MOLINO DEL REY--STORMING\r\nOF CHAPULTEPEC--SAN COSME--EVACUATION OF THE CITY--HALLS OF THE\r\nMONTEZUMAS.\r\n\r\nThe route followed by the army from Puebla to the City of Mexico was\r\nover Rio Frio mountain, the road leading over which, at the highest\r\npoint, is about eleven thousand feet above tide water. The pass through\r\nthis mountain might have been easily defended, but it was not; and the\r\nadvanced division reached the summit in three days after leaving Puebla.\r\nThe City of Mexico lies west of Rio Frio mountain, on a plain backed by\r\nanother mountain six miles farther west, with others still nearer on the\r\nnorth and south.  Between the western base of Rio Frio and the City of\r\nMexico there are three lakes, Chalco and Xochimilco on the left and\r\nTexcoco on the right, extending to the east end of the City of Mexico.\r\nChalco and Texcoco are divided by a narrow strip of land over which the\r\ndirect road to the city runs.  Xochimilco is also to the left of the\r\nroad, but at a considerable distance south of it, and is connected with\r\nLake Chalco by a narrow channel.  There is a high rocky mound, called El\r\nPenon, on the right of the road, springing up from the low flat ground\r\ndividing the lakes.  This mound was strengthened by intrenchments at its\r\nbase and summit, and rendered a direct attack impracticable.\r\n\r\nScott's army was rapidly concentrated about Ayotla and other points near\r\nthe eastern end of Lake Chalco.  Reconnoissances were made up to within\r\ngun-shot of El Penon, while engineers were seeking a route by the south\r\nside of Lake Chalco to flank the city, and come upon it from the south\r\nand south-west.  A way was found around the lake, and by the 18th of\r\nAugust troops were in St. Augustin Tlalpam, a town about eleven miles\r\ndue south from the plaza of the capital.  Between St. Augustin Tlalpam\r\nand the city lie the hacienda of San Antonio and the village of\r\nChurubusco, and south-west of them is Contreras.  All these points,\r\nexcept St. Augustin Tlalpam, were intrenched and strongly garrisoned.\r\nContreras is situated on the side of a mountain, near its base, where\r\nvolcanic rocks are piled in great confusion, reaching nearly to San\r\nAntonio.  This made the approach to the city from the south very\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThe brigade to which I was attached--Garland's, of Worth's division--was\r\nsent to confront San Antonio, two or three miles from St. Augustin\r\nTlalpam, on the road to Churubusco and the City of Mexico.  The ground\r\non which San Antonio stands is completely in the valley, and the surface\r\nof the land is only a little above the level of the lakes, and, except\r\nto the south-west, it was cut up by deep ditches filled with water.  To\r\nthe south-west is the Pedregal--the volcanic rock before spoken of--over\r\nwhich cavalry or artillery could not be passed, and infantry would make\r\nbut poor progress if confronted by an enemy.  From the position occupied\r\nby Garland's brigade, therefore, no movement could be made against the\r\ndefences of San Antonio except to the front, and by a narrow causeway,\r\nover perfectly level ground, every inch of which was commanded by the\r\nenemy's artillery and infantry.  If Contreras, some three miles west and\r\nsouth, should fall into our hands, troops from there could move to the\r\nright flank of all the positions held by the enemy between us and the\r\ncity.  Under these circumstances General Scott directed the holding of\r\nthe front of the enemy without making an attack until further orders.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of August, the day of reaching San Augustin Tlalpam,\r\nGarland's brigade secured a position within easy range of the advanced\r\nintrenchments of San Antonio, but where his troops were protected by an\r\nartificial embankment that had been thrown up for some other purpose\r\nthan defense.  General Scott at once set his engineers reconnoitring the\r\nworks about Contreras, and on the 19th movements were commenced to get\r\ntroops into positions from which an assault could be made upon the force\r\noccupying that place.  The Pedregal on the north and north-east, and the\r\nmountain on the south, made the passage by either flank of the enemy's\r\ndefences difficult, for their work stood exactly between those natural\r\nbulwarks; but a road was completed during the day and night of the 19th,\r\nand troops were got to the north and west of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThis affair, like that of Cerro Gordo, was an engagement in which the\r\nofficers of the engineer corps won special distinction.  In fact, in\r\nboth cases, tasks which seemed difficult at first sight were made easier\r\nfor the troops that had to execute them than they would have been on an\r\nordinary field.  The very strength of each of these positions was, by\r\nthe skill of the engineers, converted into a defence for the assaulting\r\nparties while securing their positions for final attack.  All the troops\r\nwith General Scott in the valley of Mexico, except a part of the\r\ndivision of General Quitman at San Augustin Tlalpam and the brigade of\r\nGarland (Worth's division) at San Antonio, were engaged at the battle of\r\nContreras, or were on their way, in obedience to the orders of their\r\nchief, to reinforce those who were engaged.  The assault was made on the\r\nmorning of the 20th, and in less than half an hour from the sound of the\r\nadvance the position was in our hands, with many prisoners and large\r\nquantities of ordnance and other stores. The brigade commanded by\r\nGeneral Riley was from its position the most conspicuous in the final\r\nassault, but all did well, volunteers and regulars.\r\n\r\nFrom the point occupied by Garland's brigade we could see the progress\r\nmade at Contreras and the movement of troops toward the flank and rear\r\nof the enemy opposing us.  The Mexicans all the way back to the city\r\ncould see the same thing, and their conduct showed plainly that they did\r\nnot enjoy the sight.  We moved out at once, and found them gone from our\r\nimmediate front.  Clarke's brigade of Worth's division now moved west\r\nover the point of the Pedregal, and after having passed to the north\r\nsufficiently to clear San Antonio, turned east and got on the causeway\r\nleading to Churubusco and the City of Mexico.  When he approached\r\nChurubusco his left, under Colonel Hoffman, attacked a tete-de-pont at\r\nthat place and brought on an engagement.  About an hour after, Garland\r\nwas ordered to advance directly along the causeway, and got up in time\r\nto take part in the engagement.  San Antonio was found evacuated, the\r\nevacuation having probably taken place immediately upon the enemy seeing\r\nthe stars and stripes waving over Contreras.\r\n\r\nThe troops that had been engaged at Contreras, and even then on their\r\nway to that battle-field, were moved by a causeway west of, and parallel\r\nto the one by way of San Antonio and Churubusco.  It was expected by the\r\ncommanding general that these troops would move north sufficiently far\r\nto flank the enemy out of his position at Churubusco, before turning\r\neast to reach the San Antonio road, but they did not succeed in this,\r\nand Churubusco proved to be about the severest battle fought in the\r\nvalley of Mexico.  General Scott coming upon the battle-field about this\r\njuncture, ordered two brigades, under Shields, to move north and turn\r\nthe right of the enemy.  This Shields did, but not without hard fighting\r\nand heavy loss.  The enemy finally gave way, leaving in our hands\r\nprisoners, artillery and small arms.  The balance of the causeway held\r\nby the enemy, up to the very gates of the city, fell in like manner.  I\r\nrecollect at this place that some of the gunners who had stood their\r\nground, were deserters from General Taylor's army on the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nBoth the strategy and tactics displayed by General Scott in these\r\nvarious engagements of the 20th of August, 1847, were faultless as I\r\nlook upon them now, after the lapse of so many years.  As before stated,\r\nthe work of the engineer officers who made the reconnoissances and led\r\nthe different commands to their destinations, was so perfect that the\r\nchief was able to give his orders to his various subordinates with all\r\nthe precision he could use on an ordinary march.  I mean, up to the\r\npoints from which the attack was to commence.  After that point is\r\nreached the enemy often induces a change of orders not before\r\ncontemplated.  The enemy outside the city outnumbered our soldiery quite\r\nthree to one, but they had become so demoralized by the succession of\r\ndefeats this day, that the City of Mexico could have been entered\r\nwithout much further bloodshed.  In fact, Captain Philip Kearney\r\n--afterwards a general in the war of the rebellion--rode with a squadron\r\nof cavalry to the very gates of the city, and would no doubt have\r\nentered with his little force, only at that point he was badly wounded,\r\nas were several of his officers.  He had not heard the call for a halt.\r\n\r\nGeneral Franklin Pierce had joined the army in Mexico, at Puebla, a\r\nshort time before the advance upon the capital commenced.  He had\r\nconsequently not been in any of the engagements of the war up to the\r\nbattle of Contreras.  By an unfortunate fall of his horse on the\r\nafternoon of the 19th he was painfully injured.  The next day, when his\r\nbrigade, with the other troops engaged on the same field, was ordered\r\nagainst the flank and rear of the enemy guarding the different points of\r\nthe road from San Augustin Tlalpam to the city, General Pierce attempted\r\nto accompany them.  He was not sufficiently recovered to do so, and\r\nfainted.  This circumstance gave rise to exceedingly unfair and unjust\r\ncriticisms of him when he became a candidate for the Presidency.\r\nWhatever General Pierce's qualifications may have been for the\r\nPresidency, he was a gentleman and a man of courage.  I was not a\r\nsupporter of him politically, but I knew him more intimately than I did\r\nany other of the volunteer generals.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott abstained from entering the city at this time, because Mr.\r\nNicholas P. Trist, the commissioner on the part of the United States to\r\nnegotiate a treaty of peace with Mexico, was with the army, and either\r\nhe or General Scott thought--probably both of them--that a treaty would\r\nbe more possible while the Mexican government was in possession of the\r\ncapital than if it was scattered and the capital in the hands of an\r\ninvader.  Be this as it may, we did not enter at that time. The army\r\ntook up positions along the slopes of the mountains south of the city,\r\nas far west as Tacubaya.  Negotiations were at once entered into with\r\nSanta Anna, who was then practically THE GOVERNMENT and the immediate\r\ncommander of all the troops engaged in defence of the country.  A truce\r\nwas signed which denied to either party the right to strengthen its\r\nposition, or to receive reinforcements during the continuance of the\r\narmistices, but authorized General Scott to draw supplies for his army\r\nfrom the city in the meantime.\r\n\r\nNegotiations were commenced at once and were kept up vigorously between\r\nMr. Trist and the commissioners appointed on the part of Mexico, until\r\nthe 2d of September.  At that time Mr. Trist handed in his ultimatum.\r\nTexas was to be given up absolutely by Mexico, and New Mexico and\r\nCalifornia ceded to the United States for a stipulated sum to be\r\nafterwards determined.  I do not suppose Mr. Trist had any discretion\r\nwhatever in regard to boundaries. The war was one of conquest, in the\r\ninterest of an institution, and the probabilities are that private\r\ninstructions were for the acquisition of territory out of which new\r\nStates might be carved.  At all events the Mexicans felt so outraged at\r\nthe terms proposed that they commenced preparations for defence, without\r\ngiving notice of the termination of the armistice.  The terms of the\r\ntruce had been violated before, when teams had been sent into the city\r\nto bring out supplies for the army.  The first train entering the city\r\nwas very severely threatened by a mob. This, however, was apologized for\r\nby the authorities and all responsibility for it denied; and thereafter,\r\nto avoid exciting the Mexican people and soldiery, our teams with their\r\nescorts were sent in at night, when the troops were in barracks and the\r\ncitizens in bed.  The circumstance was overlooked and negotiations\r\ncontinued.  As soon as the news reached General Scott of the second\r\nviolation of the armistice, about the 4th of September, he wrote a\r\nvigorous note to President Santa Anna, calling his attention to it, and,\r\nreceiving an unsatisfactory reply, declared the armistice at an end.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott, with Worth's division, was now occupying Tacubaya, a\r\nvillage some four miles south-west of the City of Mexico, and extending\r\nfrom the base up the mountain-side for the distance of half a mile.\r\nMore than a mile west, and also a little above the plain, stands Molino\r\ndel Rey.  The mill is a long stone structure, one story high and several\r\nhundred feet in length.  At the period of which I speak General Scott\r\nsupposed a portion of the mill to be used as a foundry for the casting\r\nof guns.  This, however, proved to be a mistake.  It was valuable to the\r\nMexicans because of the quantity of grain it contained. The building is\r\nflat roofed, and a line of sand-bags over the outer walls rendered the\r\ntop quite a formidable defence for infantry.  Chapultepec is a mound\r\nspringing up from the plain to the height of probably three hundred\r\nfeet, and almost in a direct line between Molino del Rey and the western\r\npart of the city.  It was fortified both on the top and on the rocky and\r\nprecipitous sides.\r\n\r\nThe City of Mexico is supplied with water by two aqueducts, resting on\r\nstrong stone arches.  One of these aqueducts draws its supply of water\r\nfrom a mountain stream coming into it at or near Molino del Rey, and\r\nruns north close to the west base of Chapultepec; thence along the\r\ncentre of a wide road, until it reaches the road running east into the\r\ncity by the Garita San Cosme; from which point the aqueduct and road\r\nboth run east to the city.  The second aqueduct starts from the east\r\nbase of Chapultepec, where it is fed by a spring, and runs north-east to\r\nthe city.  This aqueduct, like the other, runs in the middle of a broad\r\nroad-way, thus leaving a space on each side.  The arches supporting the\r\naqueduct afforded protection for advancing troops as well as to those\r\nengaged defensively.  At points on the San Cosme road parapets were\r\nthrown across, with an embrasure for a single piece of artillery in\r\neach.  At the point where both road and aqueduct turn at right angles\r\nfrom north to east, there was not only one of these parapets supplied by\r\none gun and infantry supports, but the houses to the north of the San\r\nCosme road, facing south and commanding a view of the road back to\r\nChapultepec, were covered with infantry, protected by parapets made of\r\nsandbags.  The roads leading to garitas (the gates) San Cosme and Belen,\r\nby which these aqueducts enter the city, were strongly intrenched.\r\nDeep, wide ditches, filled with water, lined the sides of both roads.\r\nSuch were the defences of the City of Mexico in September, 1847, on the\r\nroutes over which General Scott entered.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Mexican war General Scott had been very partial to General\r\nWorth--indeed he continued so up to the close of hostilities--but, for\r\nsome reason, Worth had become estranged from his chief.  Scott evidently\r\ntook this coldness somewhat to heart.  He did not retaliate, however,\r\nbut on the contrary showed every disposition to appease his subordinate.\r\nIt was understood at the time that he gave Worth authority to plan and\r\nexecute the battle of Molino del Rey without dictation or interference\r\nfrom any one, for the very purpose of restoring their former relations.\r\nThe effort failed, and the two generals remained ever after cold and\r\nindifferent towards each other, if not actually hostile.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Molino del Rey was fought on the 8th of September.  The\r\nnight of the 7th, Worth sent for his brigade and regimental commanders,\r\nwith their staffs, to come to his quarters to receive instructions for\r\nthe morrow.  These orders contemplated a movement up to within striking\r\ndistance of the Mills before daylight.  The engineers had reconnoitred\r\nthe ground as well as possible, and had acquired all the information\r\nnecessary to base proper orders both for approach and attack.\r\n\r\nBy daylight on the morning of the 8th, the troops to be engaged at\r\nMolino were all at the places designated.  The ground in front of the\r\nMills, to the south, was commanded by the artillery from the summit of\r\nChapultepec as well as by the lighter batteries at hand; but a charge\r\nwas made, and soon all was over.  Worth's troops entered the Mills by\r\nevery door, and the enemy beat a hasty retreat back to Chapultepec.  Had\r\nthis victory been followed up promptly, no doubt Americans and Mexicans\r\nwould have gone over the defences of Chapultepec so near together that\r\nthe place would have fallen into our hands without further loss.  The\r\ndefenders of the works could not have fired upon us without endangering\r\ntheir own men.  This was not done, and five days later more valuable\r\nlives were sacrificed to carry works which had been so nearly in our\r\npossession on the 8th.  I do not criticise the failure to capture\r\nChapultepec at this time.  The result that followed the first assault\r\ncould not possibly have been foreseen, and to profit by the unexpected\r\nadvantage, the commanding general must have been on the spot and given\r\nthe necessary instructions at the moment, or the troops must have kept\r\non without orders.  It is always, however, in order to follow a\r\nretreating foe, unless stopped or otherwise directed.  The loss on our\r\nside at Molino del Rey was severe for the numbers engaged.  It was\r\nespecially so among commissioned officers.\r\n\r\nI was with the earliest of the troops to enter the Mills.  In passing\r\nthrough to the north side, looking towards Chapultepec, I happened to\r\nnotice that there were armed Mexicans still on top of the building, only\r\na few feet from many of our men.  Not seeing any stairway or ladder\r\nreaching to the top of the building, I took a few soldiers, and had a\r\ncart that happened to be standing near brought up, and, placing the\r\nshafts against the wall and chocking the wheels so that the cart could\r\nnot back, used the shafts as a sort of ladder extending to within three\r\nor four feet of the top.  By this I climbed to the roof of the building,\r\nfollowed by a few men, but found a private soldier had preceded me by\r\nsome other way.  There were still quite a number of Mexicans on the\r\nroof, among them a major and five or six officers of lower grades, who\r\nhad not succeeded in getting away before our troops occupied the\r\nbuilding.  They still had their arms, while the soldier before mentioned\r\nwas walking as sentry, guarding the prisoners he had SURROUNDED, all by\r\nhimself.  I halted the sentinel, received the swords from the\r\ncommissioned officers, and proceeded, with the assistance of the\r\nsoldiers now with me, to disable the muskets by striking them against\r\nthe edge of the wall, and throw them to the ground below.\r\n\r\nMolino del Rey was now captured, and the troops engaged, with the\r\nexception of an appropriate guard over the captured position and\r\nproperty, were marched back to their quarters in Tacubaya. The\r\nengagement did not last many minutes, but the killed and wounded were\r\nnumerous for the number of troops engaged.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 11th batteries were established which could play\r\nupon the fortifications of Chapultepec.  The bombardment commenced early\r\non the morning of the 12th, but there was no further engagement during\r\nthis day than that of the artillery.  General Scott assigned the capture\r\nof Chapultepec to General Pillow, but did not leave the details to his\r\njudgment. Two assaulting columns, two hundred and fifty men each,\r\ncomposed of volunteers for the occasion, were formed.  They were\r\ncommanded by Captains McKinzie and Casey respectively.  The assault was\r\nsuccessful, but bloody.\r\n\r\nIn later years, if not at the time, the battles of Molino del Rey and\r\nChapultepec have seemed to me to have been wholly unnecessary.  When the\r\nassaults upon the garitas of San Cosme and Belen were determined upon,\r\nthe road running east to the former gate could have been reached easily,\r\nwithout an engagement, by moving along south of the Mills until west of\r\nthem sufficiently far to be out of range, thence north to the road above\r\nmentioned; or, if desirable to keep the two attacking columns nearer\r\ntogether, the troops could have been turned east so as to come on the\r\naqueduct road out of range of the guns from Chapultepec.  In like\r\nmanner, the troops designated to act against Belen could have kept east\r\nof Chapultepec, out of range, and come on to the aqueduct, also out of\r\nrange of Chapultepec. Molino del Rey and Chapultepec would both have\r\nbeen necessarily evacuated if this course had been pursued, for they\r\nwould have been turned.\r\n\r\nGeneral Quitman, a volunteer from the State of Mississippi, who stood\r\nwell with the army both as a soldier and as a man, commanded the column\r\nacting against Belen.  General Worth commanded the column against San\r\nCosme.  When Chapultepec fell the advance commenced along the two\r\naqueduct roads.  I was on the road to San Cosme, and witnessed most that\r\ntook place on that route.  When opposition was encountered our troops\r\nsheltered themselves by keeping under the arches supporting the\r\naqueduct, advancing an arch at a time.  We encountered no serious\r\nobstruction until within gun-shot of the point where the road we were on\r\nintersects that running east to the city, the point where the aqueduct\r\nturns at a right angle.  I have described the defences of this position\r\nbefore.  There were but three commissioned officers besides myself, that\r\nI can now call to mind, with the advance when the above position was\r\nreached. One of these officers was a Lieutenant Semmes, of the Marine\r\nCorps.  I think Captain Gore, and Lieutenant Judah, of the 4th infantry,\r\nwere the others.  Our progress was stopped for the time by the single\r\npiece of artillery at the angle of the roads and the infantry occupying\r\nthe house-tops back from it.\r\n\r\nWest of the road from where we were, stood a house occupying the\r\nsouth-west angle made by the San Cosme road and the road we were moving\r\nupon. A stone wall ran from the house along each of these roads for a\r\nconsiderable distance and thence back until it joined, enclosing quite a\r\nyard about the house.  I watched my opportunity and skipped across the\r\nroad and behind the south wall.  Proceeding cautiously to the west\r\ncorner of the enclosure, I peeped around and seeing nobody, continued,\r\nstill cautiously, until the road running east and west was reached.  I\r\nthen returned to the troops, and called for volunteers.  All that were\r\nclose to me, or that heard me, about a dozen, offered their services.\r\nCommanding them to carry their arms at a trail, I watched our\r\nopportunity and got them across the road and under cover of the wall\r\nbeyond, before the enemy had a shot at us. Our men under cover of the\r\narches kept a close watch on the intrenchments that crossed our path and\r\nthe house-tops beyond, and whenever a head showed itself above the\r\nparapets they would fire at it.  Our crossing was thus made practicable\r\nwithout loss.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached a safe position I instructed my little command again to\r\ncarry their arms at a trail, not to fire at the enemy until they were\r\nordered, and to move very cautiously following me until the San Cosme\r\nroad was reached; we would then be on the flank of the men serving the\r\ngun on the road, and with no obstruction between us and them.  When we\r\nreached the south-west corner of the enclosure before described, I saw\r\nsome United States troops pushing north through a shallow ditch near by,\r\nwho had come up since my reconnaissance.  This was the company of\r\nCaptain Horace Brooks, of the artillery, acting as infantry.  I\r\nexplained to Brooks briefly what I had discovered and what I was about\r\nto do.  He said, as I knew the ground and he did not, I might go on and\r\nhe would follow.  As soon as we got on the road leading to the city the\r\ntroops serving the gun on the parapet retreated, and those on the\r\nhouse-tops near by followed; our men went after them in such close\r\npursuit--the troops we had left under the arches joining--that a second\r\nline across the road, about half-way between the first and the garita,\r\nwas carried. No reinforcements had yet come up except Brooks's company,\r\nand the position we had taken was too advanced to be held by so small a\r\nforce.  It was given up, but retaken later in the day, with some loss.\r\n\r\nWorth's command gradually advanced to the front now open to it.  Later\r\nin the day in reconnoitring I found a church off to the south of the\r\nroad, which looked to me as if the belfry would command the ground back\r\nof the garita San Cosme.  I got an officer of the voltigeurs, with a\r\nmountain howitzer and men to work it, to go with me.  The road being in\r\npossession of the enemy, we had to take the field to the south to reach\r\nthe church.  This took us over several ditches breast deep in water and\r\ngrown up with water plants.  These ditches, however, were not over eight\r\nor ten feet in width.  The howitzer was taken to pieces and carried by\r\nthe men to its destination.  When I knocked for admission a priest came\r\nto the door who, while extremely polite, declined to admit us.  With the\r\nlittle Spanish then at my command, I explained to him that he might save\r\nproperty by opening the door, and he certainly would save himself from\r\nbecoming a prisoner, for a time at least; and besides, I intended to go\r\nin whether he consented or not.  He began to see his duty in the same\r\nlight that I did, and opened the door, though he did not look as if it\r\ngave him special pleasure to do so.  The gun was carried to the belfry\r\nand put together.  We were not more than two or three hundred yards from\r\nSan Cosme.  The shots from our little gun dropped in upon the enemy and\r\ncreated great confusion.  Why they did not send out a small party and\r\ncapture us, I do not know.  We had no infantry or other defences besides\r\nour one gun.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this gun upon the troops about the gate of the city was so\r\nmarked that General Worth saw it from his position. (*3) He was so\r\npleased that he sent a staff officer, Lieutenant Pemberton--later\r\nLieutenant-General commanding the defences of Vicksburg--to bring me to\r\nhim.  He expressed his gratification at the services the howitzer in the\r\nchurch steeple was doing, saying that every shot was effective, and\r\nordered a captain of voltigeurs to report to me with another howitzer to\r\nbe placed along with the one already rendering so much service.  I could\r\nnot tell the General that there was not room enough in the steeple for\r\nanother gun, because he probably would have looked upon such a statement\r\nas a contradiction from a second lieutenant.  I took the captain with\r\nme, but did not use his gun.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 13th of September was spent by the troops under General\r\nWorth in the houses near San Cosme, and in line confronting the general\r\nline of the enemy across to Belen.  The troops that I was with were in\r\nthe houses north of the road leading into the city, and were engaged\r\nduring the night in cutting passage-ways from one house to another\r\ntowards the town.  During the night Santa Anna, with his army--except\r\nthe deserters--left the city.  He liberated all the convicts confined in\r\nthe town, hoping, no doubt, that they would inflict upon us some injury\r\nbefore daylight; but several hours after Santa Anna was out of the way,\r\nthe city authorities sent a delegation to General Scott to ask--if not\r\ndemand--an armistice, respecting church property, the rights of citizens\r\nand the supremacy of the city government in the management of municipal\r\naffairs.  General Scott declined to trammel himself with conditions, but\r\ngave assurances that those who chose to remain within our lines would be\r\nprotected so long as they behaved themselves properly.\r\n\r\nGeneral Quitman had advanced along his line very successfully on the\r\n13th, so that at night his command occupied nearly the same position at\r\nBelen that Worth's troops did about San Cosme. After the interview above\r\nrelated between General Scott and the city council, orders were issued\r\nfor the cautious entry of both columns in the morning.  The troops under\r\nWorth were to stop at the Alameda, a park near the west end of the city.\r\nQuitman was to go directly to the Plaza, and take possession of the\r\nPalace--a mass of buildings on the east side in which Congress has its\r\nsessions, the national courts are held, the public offices are all\r\nlocated, the President resides, and much room is left for museums,\r\nreceptions, etc.  This is the building generally designated as the\r\n\"Halls of the Montezumas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPROMOTION TO FIRST LIEUTENANT--CAPTURE OF THE CITY OF MEXICO--THE ARMY\r\n--MEXICAN SOLDIERS--PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.\r\n\r\nOn entering the city the troops were fired upon by the released\r\nconvicts, and possibly by deserters and hostile citizens.  The streets\r\nwere deserted, and the place presented the appearance of a \"city of the\r\ndead,\" except for this firing by unseen persons from house-tops,\r\nwindows, and around corners.  In this firing the lieutenant-colonel of\r\nmy regiment, Garland, was badly wounded, Lieutenant Sidney Smith, of the\r\n4th infantry, was also wounded mortally.  He died a few days after, and\r\nby his death I was promoted to the grade of first lieutenant.(*4)  I had\r\ngone into the battle of Palo Alto in May, 1846, a second lieutenant, and\r\nI entered the city of Mexico sixteen months later with the same rank,\r\nafter having been in all the engagements possible for any one man and in\r\na regiment that lost more officers during the war than it ever had\r\npresent at any one engagement.  My regiment lost four commissioned\r\nofficers, all senior to me, by steamboat explosions during the Mexican\r\nwar.  The Mexicans were not so discriminating.  They sometimes picked\r\noff my juniors.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott soon followed the troops into the city, in state.  I\r\nwonder that he was not fired upon, but I believe he was not; at all\r\nevents he was not hurt.  He took quarters at first in the \"Halls of the\r\nMontezumas,\" and from there issued his wise and discreet orders for the\r\ngovernment of a conquered city, and for suppressing the hostile acts of\r\nliberated convicts already spoken of--orders which challenge the respect\r\nof all who study them.  Lawlessness was soon suppressed, and the City of\r\nMexico settled down into a quiet, law-abiding place.  The people began\r\nto make their appearance upon the streets without fear of the invaders.\r\nShortly afterwards the bulk of the troops were sent from the city to the\r\nvillages at the foot of the mountains, four or five miles to the south\r\nand south-west.\r\n\r\nWhether General Scott approved of the Mexican war and the manner in\r\nwhich it was brought about, I have no means of knowing.  His orders to\r\ntroops indicate only a soldierly spirit, with probably a little regard\r\nfor the perpetuation of his own fame.  On the other hand, General\r\nTaylor's, I think, indicate that he considered the administration\r\naccountable for the war, and felt no responsibility resting on himself\r\nfurther than for the faithful performance of his duties.  Both generals\r\ndeserve the commendations of their countrymen and to live in the\r\ngrateful memory of this people to the latest generation.\r\n\r\nEarlier in this narrative I have stated that the plain, reached after\r\npassing the mountains east of Perote, extends to the cities of Puebla\r\nand Mexico.  The route travelled by the army before reaching Puebla,\r\ngoes over a pass in a spur of mountain coming up from the south.  This\r\npass is very susceptible of defence by a smaller against a larger force.\r\nAgain, the highest point of the road-bed between Vera Cruz and the City\r\nof Mexico is over Rio Frio mountain, which also might have been\r\nsuccessfully defended by an inferior against a superior force.  But by\r\nmoving north of the mountains, and about thirty miles north of Puebla,\r\nboth of these passes would have been avoided.  The road from Perote to\r\nthe City of Mexico, by this latter route, is as level as the prairies in\r\nour West.  Arriving due north from Puebla, troops could have been\r\ndetached to take possession of that place, and then proceeding west with\r\nthe rest of the army no mountain would have been encountered before\r\nreaching the City of Mexico.  It is true this road would have brought\r\ntroops in by Guadalupe--a town, church and detached spur of mountain\r\nabout two miles north of the capital, all bearing the same general name\r\n--and at this point Lake Texcoco comes near to the mountain, which was\r\nfortified both at the base and on the sides:  but troops could have\r\npassed north of the mountain and come in only a few miles to the\r\nnorth-west, and so flanked the position, as they actually did on the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed to me that this northern route to the City of\r\nMexico, would have been the better one to have taken.  But my later\r\nexperience has taught me two lessons:  first, that things are seen\r\nplainer after the events have occurred; second, that the most confident\r\ncritics are generally those who know the least about the matter\r\ncriticised.  I know just enough about the Mexican war to approve\r\nheartily of most of the generalship, but to differ with a little of it.\r\nIt is natural that an important city like Puebla should not have been\r\npassed with contempt; it may be natural that the direct road to it\r\nshould have been taken; but it could have been passed, its evacuation\r\ninsured and possession acquired without danger of encountering the enemy\r\nin intricate mountain defiles.  In this same way the City of Mexico\r\ncould have been approached without any danger of opposition, except in\r\nthe open field.\r\n\r\nBut General Scott's successes are an answer to all criticism. He invaded\r\na populous country, penetrating two hundred and sixty miles into the\r\ninterior, with a force at no time equal to one-half of that opposed to\r\nhim; he was without a base; the enemy was always intrenched, always on\r\nthe defensive; yet he won every battle, he captured the capital, and\r\nconquered the government.  Credit is due to the troops engaged, it is\r\ntrue, but the plans and the strategy were the general's.\r\n\r\nI had now made marches and been in battle under both General Scott and\r\nGeneral Taylor.  The former divided his force of 10,500 men into four\r\ncolumns, starting a day apart, in moving from Puebla to the capital of\r\nthe nation, when it was known that an army more than twice as large as\r\nhis own stood ready to resist his coming.  The road was broad and the\r\ncountry open except in crossing the Rio Frio mountain.  General Taylor\r\npursued the same course in marching toward an enemy.  He moved even in\r\nsmaller bodies.  I never thought at the time to doubt the infallibility\r\nof these two generals in all matters pertaining to their profession.  I\r\nsupposed they moved in small bodies because more men could not be passed\r\nover a single road on the same day with their artillery and necessary\r\ntrains.  Later I found the fallacy of this belief.  The rebellion, which\r\nfollowed as a sequence to the Mexican war, never could have been\r\nsuppressed if larger bodies of men could not have been moved at the same\r\ntime than was the custom under Scott and Taylor.\r\n\r\nThe victories in Mexico were, in every instance, over vastly superior\r\nnumbers.  There were two reasons for this.  Both General Scott and\r\nGeneral Taylor had such armies as are not often got together.  At the\r\nbattles of Palo Alto and Resaca-de-la-Palma, General Taylor had a small\r\narmy, but it was composed exclusively of regular troops, under the best\r\nof drill and discipline.  Every officer, from the highest to the lowest,\r\nwas educated in his profession, not at West Point necessarily, but in\r\nthe camp, in garrison, and many of them in Indian wars. The rank and\r\nfile were probably inferior, as material out of which to make an army,\r\nto the volunteers that participated in all the later battles of the war;\r\nbut they were brave men, and then drill and discipline brought out all\r\nthere was in them.  A better army, man for man, probably never faced an\r\nenemy than the one commanded by General Taylor in the earliest two\r\nengagements of the Mexican war.  The volunteers who followed were of\r\nbetter material, but without drill or discipline at the start.  They\r\nwere associated with so many disciplined men and professionally educated\r\nofficers, that when they went into engagements it was with a confidence\r\nthey would not have felt otherwise.  They became soldiers themselves\r\nalmost at once.  All these conditions we would enjoy again in case of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican army of that day was hardly an organization.  The private\r\nsoldier was picked up from the lower class of the inhabitants when\r\nwanted; his consent was not asked; he was poorly clothed, worse fed, and\r\nseldom paid.  He was turned adrift when no longer wanted.  The officers\r\nof the lower grades were but little superior to the men.  With all this\r\nI have seen as brave stands made by some of these men as I have ever\r\nseen made by soldiers.  Now Mexico has a standing army larger than that\r\nof the United States.  They have a military school modelled after West\r\nPoint.  Their officers are educated and, no doubt, generally brave.  The\r\nMexican war of 1846-8 would be an impossibility in this generation.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans have shown a patriotism which it would be well if we would\r\nimitate in part, but with more regard to truth.  They celebrate the\r\nanniversaries of Chapultepec and Molino del Rey as of very great\r\nvictories.  The anniversaries are recognized as national holidays.  At\r\nthese two battles, while the United States troops were victorious, it\r\nwas at very great sacrifice of life compared with what the Mexicans\r\nsuffered.  The Mexicans, as on many other occasions, stood up as well as\r\nany troops ever did.  The trouble seemed to be the lack of experience\r\namong the officers, which led them after a certain time to simply quit,\r\nwithout being particularly whipped, but because they had fought enough.\r\nTheir authorities of the present day grow enthusiastic over their theme\r\nwhen telling of these victories, and speak with pride of the large sum\r\nof money they forced us to pay in the end.  With us, now twenty years\r\nafter the close of the most stupendous war ever known, we have writers\r\n--who profess devotion to the nation--engaged in trying to prove that the\r\nUnion forces were not victorious; practically, they say, we were slashed\r\naround from Donelson to Vicksburg and to Chattanooga; and in the East\r\nfrom Gettysburg to Appomattox, when the physical rebellion gave out from\r\nsheer exhaustion.  There is no difference in the amount of romance in\r\nthe two stories.\r\n\r\nI would not have the anniversaries of our victories celebrated, nor\r\nthose of our defeats made fast days and spent in humiliation and prayer;\r\nbut I would like to see truthful history written. Such history will do\r\nfull credit to the courage, endurance and soldierly ability of the\r\nAmerican citizen, no matter what section of the country he hailed from,\r\nor in what ranks he fought.  The justice of the cause which in the end\r\nprevailed, will, I doubt not, come to be acknowledged by every citizen\r\nof the land, in time.  For the present, and so long as there are living\r\nwitnesses of the great war of sections, there will be people who will\r\nnot be consoled for the loss of a cause which they believed to be holy.\r\nAs time passes, people, even of the South, will begin to wonder how it\r\nwas possible that their ancestors ever fought for or justified\r\ninstitutions which acknowledged the right of property in man.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the capital and the dispersal of the government of\r\nMexico, it looked very much as if military occupation of the country for\r\na long time might be necessary. General Scott at once began the\r\npreparation of orders, regulations and laws in view of this contingency.\r\nHe contemplated making the country pay all the expenses of the\r\noccupation, without the army becoming a perceptible burden upon the\r\npeople.  His plan was to levy a direct tax upon the separate states, and\r\ncollect, at the ports left open to trade, a duty on all imports.  From\r\nthe beginning of the war private property had not been taken, either for\r\nthe use of the army or of individuals, without full compensation.  This\r\npolicy was to be pursued.  There were not troops enough in the valley of\r\nMexico to occupy many points, but now that there was no organized army\r\nof the enemy of any size, reinforcements could be got from the Rio\r\nGrande, and there were also new volunteers arriving from time to time,\r\nall by way of Vera Cruz.  Military possession was taken of Cuernavaca,\r\nfifty miles south of the City of Mexico; of Toluca, nearly as far west,\r\nand of Pachuca, a mining town of great importance, some sixty miles to\r\nthe north-east.  Vera Cruz, Jalapa, Orizaba, and Puebla were already in\r\nour possession.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Mexican government had departed in the person of Santa\r\nAnna, and it looked doubtful for a time whether the United States\r\ncommissioner, Mr. Trist, would find anybody to negotiate with.  A\r\ntemporary government, however, was soon established at Queretaro, and\r\nTrist began negotiations for a conclusion of the war.  Before terms were\r\nfinally agreed upon he was ordered back to Washington, but General Scott\r\nprevailed upon him to remain, as an arrangement had been so nearly\r\nreached, and the administration must approve his acts if he succeeded in\r\nmaking such a treaty as had been contemplated in his instructions.  The\r\ntreaty was finally signed the 2d of February, 1848, and accepted by the\r\ngovernment at Washington.  It is that known as the \"Treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo,\" and secured to the United States the Rio Grande as the\r\nboundary of Texas, and the whole territory then included in New Mexico\r\nand Upper California, for the sum of $15,000,000.\r\n\r\nSoon after entering the city of Mexico, the opposition of Generals\r\nPillow, Worth and Colonel Duncan to General Scott became very marked.\r\nScott claimed that they had demanded of the President his removal.  I do\r\nnot know whether this is so or not, but I do know of their unconcealed\r\nhostility to their chief.  At last he placed them in arrest, and\r\npreferred charges against them of insubordination and disrespect.  This\r\nact brought on a crisis in the career of the general commanding.  He had\r\nasserted from the beginning that the administration was hostile to him;\r\nthat it had failed in its promises of men and war material; that the\r\nPresident himself had shown duplicity if not treachery in the endeavor\r\nto procure the appointment of Benton:  and the administration now gave\r\nopen evidence of its enmity.  About the middle of February orders came\r\nconvening a court of inquiry, composed of Brevet Brigadier-General\r\nTowson, the paymaster-general of the army, Brigadier-General Cushing and\r\nColonel Belknap, to inquire into the conduct of the accused and the\r\naccuser, and shortly afterwards orders were received from Washington,\r\nrelieving Scott of the command of the army in the field and assigning\r\nMajor-General William O. Butler of Kentucky to the place.  This order\r\nalso released Pillow, Worth and Duncan from arrest.\r\n\r\nIf a change was to be made the selection of General Butler was agreeable\r\nto every one concerned, so far as I remember to have heard expressions\r\non the subject.  There were many who regarded the treatment of General\r\nScott as harsh and unjust.  It is quite possible that the vanity of the\r\nGeneral had led him to say and do things that afforded a plausible\r\npretext to the administration for doing just what it did and what it had\r\nwanted to do from the start.  The court tried the accuser quite as much\r\nas the accused.  It was adjourned before completing its labors, to meet\r\nin Frederick, Maryland.  General Scott left the country, and never after\r\nhad more than the nominal command of the army until early in 1861.  He\r\ncertainly was not sustained in his efforts to maintain discipline in\r\nhigh places.\r\n\r\nThe efforts to kill off politically the two successful generals, made\r\nthem both candidates for the Presidency.  General Taylor was nominated\r\nin 1848, and was elected.  Four years later General Scott received the\r\nnomination but was badly beaten, and the party nominating him died with\r\nhis defeat.(*5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTREATY OF PEACE--MEXICAN BULL FIGHTS--REGIMENTAL QUARTERMASTER--TRIP TO\r\nPOPOCATAPETL--TRIP TO THE CAVES OF MEXICO.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of peace between the two countries was signed by the\r\ncommissioners of each side early in February, 1848.  It took a\r\nconsiderable time for it to reach Washington, receive the approval of\r\nthe administration, and be finally ratified by the Senate.  It was\r\nnaturally supposed by the army that there would be no more fighting, and\r\nofficers and men were of course anxious to get home, but knowing there\r\nmust be delay they contented themselves as best they could.  Every\r\nSunday there was a bull fight for the amusement of those who would pay\r\ntheir fifty cents.  I attended one of them--just one--not wishing to\r\nleave the country without having witnessed the national sport.  The\r\nsight to me was sickening.  I could not see how human beings could enjoy\r\nthe sufferings of beasts, and often of men, as they seemed to do on\r\nthese occasions.\r\n\r\nAt these sports there are usually from four to six bulls sacrificed.\r\nThe audience occupies seats around the ring in which the exhibition is\r\ngiven, each seat but the foremost rising higher than the one in front,\r\nso that every one can get a full view of the sport.  When all is ready a\r\nbull is turned into the ring.  Three or four men come in, mounted on the\r\nmerest skeletons of horses blind or blind-folded and so weak that they\r\ncould not make a sudden turn with their riders without danger of falling\r\ndown.  The men are armed with spears having a point as sharp as a\r\nneedle.  Other men enter the arena on foot, armed with red flags and\r\nexplosives about the size of a musket cartridge.  To each of these\r\nexplosives is fastened a barbed needle which serves the purpose of\r\nattaching them to the bull by running the needle into the skin.  Before\r\nthe animal is turned loose a lot of these explosives are attached to\r\nhim.  The pain from the pricking of the skin by the needles is\r\nexasperating; but when the explosions of the cartridges commence the\r\nanimal becomes frantic.  As he makes a lunge towards one horseman,\r\nanother runs a spear into him.  He turns towards his last tormentor when\r\na man on foot holds out a red flag; the bull rushes for this and is\r\nallowed to take it on his horns.  The flag drops and covers the eyes of\r\nthe animal so that he is at a loss what to do; it is jerked from him and\r\nthe torment is renewed.  When the animal is worked into an\r\nuncontrollable frenzy, the horsemen withdraw, and the matadores\r\n--literally murderers--enter, armed with knives having blades twelve or\r\neighteen inches long, and sharp.  The trick is to dodge an attack from\r\nthe animal and stab him to the heart as he passes. If these efforts fail\r\nthe bull is finally lassoed, held fast and killed by driving a knife\r\nblade into the spinal column just back of the horns.  He is then dragged\r\nout by horses or mules, another is let into the ring, and the same\r\nperformance is renewed.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion when I was present one of the bulls was not turned aside\r\nby the attacks in the rear, the presentations of the red flag, etc.,\r\netc., but kept right on, and placing his horns under the flanks of a\r\nhorse threw him and his rider to the ground with great force.  The horse\r\nwas killed and the rider lay prostrate as if dead.  The bull was then\r\nlassoed and killed in the manner above described.  Men came in and\r\ncarried the dead man off in a litter.  When the slaughtered bull and\r\nhorse were dragged out, a fresh bull was turned into the ring.\r\nConspicuous among the spectators was the man who had been carried out on\r\na litter but a few minutes before.  He was only dead so far as that\r\nperformance went; but the corpse was so lively that it could not forego\r\nthe chance of witnessing the discomfiture of some of his brethren who\r\nmight not be so fortunate.  There was a feeling of disgust manifested by\r\nthe audience to find that he had come to life again.  I confess that I\r\nfelt sorry to see the cruelty to the bull and the horse.  I did not stay\r\nfor the conclusion of the performance; but while I did stay, there was\r\nnot a bull killed in the prescribed way.\r\n\r\nBull fights are now prohibited in the Federal District--embracing a\r\nterritory around the City of Mexico, somewhat larger than the District\r\nof Columbia--and they are not an institution in any part of the country.\r\nDuring one of my recent visits to Mexico, bull fights were got up in my\r\nhonor at Puebla and at Pachuca.  I was not notified in advance so as to\r\nbe able to decline and thus prevent the performance; but in both cases I\r\ncivilly declined to attend.\r\n\r\nAnother amusement of the people of Mexico of that day, and one which\r\nnearly all indulged in, male and female, old and young, priest and\r\nlayman, was Monte playing.  Regular feast weeks were held every year at\r\nwhat was then known as St. Augustin Tlalpam, eleven miles out of town.\r\nThere were dealers to suit every class and condition of people.  In many\r\nof the booths tlackos--the copper coin of the country, four of them\r\nmaking six and a quarter cents of our money--were piled up in great\r\nquantities, with some silver, to accommodate the people who could not\r\nbet more than a few pennies at a time.  In other booths silver formed\r\nthe bulk of the capital of the bank, with a few doubloons to be changed\r\nif there should be a run of luck against the bank.  In some there was no\r\ncoin except gold.  Here the rich were said to bet away their entire\r\nestates in a single day.  All this is stopped now.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I was kept somewhat busy during the winter of 1847-8.  My\r\nregiment was stationed in Tacubaya.  I was regimental quartermaster and\r\ncommissary.  General Scott had been unable to get clothing for the\r\ntroops from the North.  The men were becoming--well, they needed\r\nclothing.  Material had to be purchased, such as could be obtained, and\r\npeople employed to make it up into \"Yankee uniforms.\"  A quartermaster\r\nin the city was designated to attend to this special duty; but clothing\r\nwas so much needed that it was seized as fast as made up.  A regiment\r\nwas glad to get a dozen suits at a time.  I had to look after this\r\nmatter for the 4th infantry.  Then our regimental fund had run down and\r\nsome of the musicians in the band had been without their extra pay for a\r\nnumber of months.\r\n\r\nThe regimental bands at that day were kept up partly by pay from the\r\ngovernment, and partly by pay from the regimental fund. There was\r\nauthority of law for enlisting a certain number of men as musicians.  So\r\nmany could receive the pay of non-commissioned officers of the various\r\ngrades, and the remainder the pay of privates.  This would not secure a\r\nband leader, nor good players on certain instruments.  In garrison there\r\nare various ways of keeping up a regimental fund sufficient to give\r\nextra pay to musicians, establish libraries and ten-pin alleys,\r\nsubscribe to magazines and furnish many extra comforts to the men.  The\r\nbest device for supplying the fund is to issue bread to the soldiers\r\ninstead of flour.  The ration used to be eighteen ounces per day of\r\neither flour or bread; and one hundred pounds of flour will make one\r\nhundred and forty pounds of bread.  This saving was purchased by the\r\ncommissary for the benefit of the fund.  In the emergency the 4th\r\ninfantry was laboring under, I rented a bakery in the city, hired\r\nbakers--Mexicans--bought fuel and whatever was necessary, and I also got\r\na contract from the chief commissary of the army for baking a large\r\namount of hard bread.  In two months I made more money for the fund than\r\nmy pay amounted to during the entire war.  While stationed at Monterey I\r\nhad relieved the post fund in the same way.  There, however, was no\r\nprofit except in the saving of flour by converting it into bread.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1848 a party of officers obtained leave to visit\r\nPopocatapetl, the highest volcano in America, and to take an escort.  I\r\nwent with the party, many of whom afterwards occupied conspicuous\r\npositions before the country.  Of those who \"went south,\" and attained\r\nhigh rank, there was Lieutenant Richard Anderson, who commanded a corps\r\nat Spottsylvania; Captain Sibley, a major-general, and, after the war,\r\nfor a number of years in the employ of the Khedive of Egypt; Captain\r\nGeorge Crittenden, a rebel general; S. B. Buckner, who surrendered Fort\r\nDonelson; and Mansfield Lovell, who commanded at New Orleans before that\r\ncity fell into the hands of the National troops.  Of those who remained\r\non our side there were Captain Andrew Porter, Lieutenant C. P. Stone and\r\nLieutenant Z. B. Tower.  There were quite a number of other officers,\r\nwhose names I cannot recollect.\r\n\r\nAt a little village (Ozumba) near the base of Popocatapetl, where we\r\npurposed to commence the ascent, we procured guides and two pack mules\r\nwith forage for our horses.  High up on the mountain there was a\r\ndeserted house of one room, called the Vaqueria, which had been occupied\r\nyears before by men in charge of cattle ranging on the mountain.  The\r\npasturage up there was very fine when we saw it, and there were still\r\nsome cattle, descendants of the former domestic herd, which had now\r\nbecome wild.  It was possible to go on horseback as far as the Vaqueria,\r\nthough the road was somewhat hazardous in places. Sometimes it was very\r\nnarrow with a yawning precipice on one side, hundreds of feet down to a\r\nroaring mountain torrent below, and almost perpendicular walls on the\r\nother side.  At one of these places one of our mules loaded with two\r\nsacks of barley, one on each side, the two about as big as he was,\r\nstruck his load against the mountain-side and was precipitated to the\r\nbottom.  The descent was steep but not perpendicular.  The mule rolled\r\nover and over until the bottom was reached, and we supposed of course\r\nthe poor animal was dashed to pieces.  What was our surprise, not long\r\nafter we had gone into bivouac, to see the lost mule, cargo and owner\r\ncoming up the ascent.  The load had protected the animal from serious\r\ninjury; and his owner had gone after him and found a way back to the\r\npath leading up to the hut where we were to stay.\r\n\r\nThe night at the Vaqueria was one of the most unpleasant I ever knew.\r\nIt was very cold and the rain fell in torrents.  A little higher up the\r\nrain ceased and snow began.  The wind blew with great velocity.  The\r\nlog-cabin we were in had lost the roof entirely on one side, and on the\r\nother it was hardly better then a sieve.  There was little or no sleep\r\nthat night.  As soon as it was light the next morning, we started to\r\nmake the ascent to the summit.  The wind continued to blow with violence\r\nand the weather was still cloudy, but there was neither rain nor snow.\r\nThe clouds, however, concealed from our view the country below us,\r\nexcept at times a momentary glimpse could be got through a clear space\r\nbetween them.  The wind carried the loose snow around the mountain-sides\r\nin such volumes as to make it almost impossible to stand up against it.\r\nWe labored on and on, until it became evident that the top could not be\r\nreached before night, if at all in such a storm, and we concluded to\r\nreturn. The descent was easy and rapid, though dangerous, until we got\r\nbelow the snow line.  At the cabin we mounted our horses, and by night\r\nwere at Ozumba.\r\n\r\nThe fatigues of the day and the loss of sleep the night before drove us\r\nto bed early.  Our beds consisted of a place on the dirt-floor with a\r\nblanket under us.  Soon all were asleep; but long before morning first\r\none and then another of our party began to cry out with excruciating\r\npain in the eyes.  Not one escaped it.  By morning the eyes of half the\r\nparty were so swollen that they were entirely closed.  The others\r\nsuffered pain equally.  The feeling was about what might be expected\r\nfrom the prick of a sharp needle at a white heat.  We remained in\r\nquarters until the afternoon bathing our eyes in cold water. This\r\nrelieved us very much, and before night the pain had entirely left.  The\r\nswelling, however, continued, and about half the party still had their\r\neyes entirely closed; but we concluded to make a start back, those who\r\ncould see a little leading the horses of those who could not see at all.\r\nWe moved back to the village of Ameca Ameca, some six miles, and stopped\r\nagain for the night.  The next morning all were entirely well and free\r\nfrom pain.  The weather was clear and Popocatapetl stood out in all its\r\nbeauty, the top looking as if not a mile away, and inviting us to\r\nreturn.  About half the party were anxious to try the ascent again, and\r\nconcluded to do so.  The remainder--I was with the remainder--concluded\r\nthat we had got all the pleasure there was to be had out of mountain\r\nclimbing, and that we would visit the great caves of Mexico, some ninety\r\nmiles from where we then were, on the road to Acapulco.\r\n\r\nThe party that ascended the mountain the second time succeeded in\r\nreaching the crater at the top, with but little of the labor they\r\nencountered in their first attempt.  Three of them--Anderson, Stone and\r\nBuckner--wrote accounts of their journey, which were published at the\r\ntime.  I made no notes of this excursion, and have read nothing about it\r\nsince, but it seems to me that I can see the whole of it as vividly as\r\nif it were but yesterday.  I have been back at Ameca Ameca, and the\r\nvillage beyond, twice in the last five years.  The scene had not changed\r\nmaterially from my recollection of it.\r\n\r\nThe party which I was with moved south down the valley to the town of\r\nCuantla, some forty miles from Ameca Ameca.  The latter stands on the\r\nplain at the foot of Popocatapetl, at an elevation of about eight\r\nthousand feet above tide water.  The slope down is gradual as the\r\ntraveller moves south, but one would not judge that, in going to\r\nCuantla, descent enough had been made to occasion a material change in\r\nthe climate and productions of the soil; but such is the case.  In the\r\nmorning we left a temperate climate where the cereals and fruits are\r\nthose common to the United States, we halted in the evening in a\r\ntropical climate where the orange and banana, the coffee and the\r\nsugar-cane were flourishing.  We had been travelling, apparently,\r\non a plain all day, but in the direction of the flow of water.\r\n\r\nSoon after the capture of the City of Mexico an armistice had been\r\nagreed to, designating the limits beyond which troops of the respective\r\narmies were not to go during its continuance. Our party knew nothing\r\nabout these limits.  As we approached Cuantla bugles sounded the\r\nassembly, and soldiers rushed from the guard-house in the edge of the\r\ntown towards us.  Our party halted, and I tied a white pocket\r\nhandkerchief to a stick and, using it as a flag of truce, proceeded on\r\nto the town.  Captains Sibley and Porter followed a few hundred yards\r\nbehind.  I was detained at the guard-house until a messenger could be\r\ndispatched to the quarters of the commanding general, who authorized\r\nthat I should be conducted to him.  I had been with the general but a\r\nfew minutes when the two officers following announced themselves.  The\r\nMexican general reminded us that it was a violation of the truce for us\r\nto be there.  However, as we had no special authority from our own\r\ncommanding general, and as we knew nothing about the terms of the truce,\r\nwe were permitted to occupy a vacant house outside the guard for the\r\nnight, with the promise of a guide to put us on the road to Cuernavaca\r\nthe next morning.\r\n\r\nCuernavaca is a town west of Guantla.  The country through which we\r\npassed, between these two towns, is tropical in climate and productions\r\nand rich in scenery.  At one point, about half-way between the two\r\nplaces, the road goes over a low pass in the mountains in which there is\r\na very quaint old town, the inhabitants of which at that day were nearly\r\nall full-blooded Indians.  Very few of them even spoke Spanish.  The\r\nhouses were built of stone and generally only one story high.  The\r\nstreets were narrow, and had probably been paved before Cortez visited\r\nthe country.  They had not been graded, but the paving had been done on\r\nthe natural surface.  We had with us one vehicle, a cart, which was\r\nprobably the first wheeled vehicle that had ever passed through that\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nOn a hill overlooking this town stands the tomb of an ancient king; and\r\nit was understood that the inhabitants venerated this tomb very highly,\r\nas well as the memory of the ruler who was supposed to be buried in it.\r\nWe ascended the mountain and surveyed the tomb; but it showed no\r\nparticular marks of architectural taste, mechanical skill or advanced\r\ncivilization.  The next day we went into Cuernavaca.\r\n\r\nAfter a day's rest at Cuernavaca our party set out again on the journey\r\nto the great caves of Mexico.  We had proceeded but a few miles when we\r\nwere stopped, as before, by a guard and notified that the terms of the\r\nexisting armistice did not permit us to go further in that direction.\r\nUpon convincing the guard that we were a mere party of pleasure seekers\r\ndesirous of visiting the great natural curiosities of the country which\r\nwe expected soon to leave, we were conducted to a large hacienda near\r\nby, and directed to remain there until the commanding general of that\r\ndepartment could be communicated with and his decision obtained as to\r\nwhether we should be permitted to pursue our journey.  The guard\r\npromised to send a messenger at once, and expected a reply by night.  At\r\nnight there was no response from the commanding general, but the captain\r\nof the guard was sure he would have a reply by morning.  Again in the\r\nmorning there was no reply.  The second evening the same thing happened,\r\nand finally we learned that the guard had sent no message or messenger\r\nto the department commander.  We determined therefore to go on unless\r\nstopped by a force sufficient to compel obedience.\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours' travel we came to a town where a scene similar to the\r\none at Cuantia occurred.  The commanding officer sent a guide to conduct\r\nour party around the village and to put us upon our road again.  This\r\nwas the last interruption:  that night we rested at a large coffee\r\nplantation, some eight miles from the cave we were on the way to visit.\r\nIt must have been a Saturday night; the peons had been paid off, and\r\nspent part of the night in gambling away their scanty week's earnings.\r\nTheir coin was principally copper, and I do not believe there was a man\r\namong them who had received as much as twenty-five cents in money.  They\r\nwere as much excited, however, as if they had been staking thousands.  I\r\nrecollect one poor fellow, who had lost his last tlacko, pulled off his\r\nshirt and, in the most excited manner, put that up on the turn of a\r\ncard.  Monte was the game played, the place out of doors, near the\r\nwindow of the room occupied by the officers of our party.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we were at the mouth of the cave at an early hour,\r\nprovided with guides, candles and rockets.  We explored to a distance of\r\nabout three miles from the entrance, and found a succession of chambers\r\nof great dimensions and of great beauty when lit up with our rockets.\r\nStalactites and stalagmites of all sizes were discovered.  Some of the\r\nformer were many feet in diameter and extended from ceiling to floor;\r\nsome of the latter were but a few feet high from the floor; but the\r\nformation is going on constantly, and many centuries hence these\r\nstalagmites will extend to the ceiling and become complete columns.  The\r\nstalagmites were all a little concave, and the cavities were filled with\r\nwater.  The water percolates through the roof, a drop at a time--often\r\nthe drops several minutes apart--and more or less charged with mineral\r\nmatter.  Evaporation goes on slowly, leaving the mineral behind.  This\r\nin time makes the immense columns, many of them thousands of tons in\r\nweight, which serve to support the roofs over the vast chambers.  I\r\nrecollect that at one point in the cave one of these columns is of such\r\nhuge proportions that there is only a narrow passage left on either side\r\nof it.  Some of our party became satisfied with their explorations\r\nbefore we had reached the point to which the guides were accustomed to\r\ntake explorers, and started back without guides.  Coming to the large\r\ncolumn spoken of, they followed it entirely around, and commenced\r\nretracing their steps into the bowels of the mountain, without being\r\naware of the fact.  When the rest of us had completed our explorations,\r\nwe started out with our guides, but had not gone far before we saw the\r\ntorches of an approaching party.  We could not conceive who these could\r\nbe, for all of us had come in together, and there were none but\r\nourselves at the entrance when we started in. Very soon we found it was\r\nour friends.  It took them some time to conceive how they had got where\r\nthey were.  They were sure they had kept straight on for the mouth of\r\nthe cave, and had gone about far enough to have reached it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nRETURN OF THE ARMY--MARRIAGE--ORDERED TO THE PACIFIC COAST--CROSSING THE\r\nISTHMUS--ARRIVAL AT SAN FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\nMy experience in the Mexican war was of great advantage to me\r\nafterwards.  Besides the many practical lessons it taught, the war\r\nbrought nearly all the officers of the regular army together so as to\r\nmake them personally acquainted.  It also brought them in contact with\r\nvolunteers, many of whom served in the war of the rebellion afterwards.\r\nThen, in my particular case, I had been at West Point at about the right\r\ntime to meet most of the graduates who were of a suitable age at the\r\nbreaking out of the rebellion to be trusted with large commands.\r\nGraduating in 1843, I was at the military academy from one to four years\r\nwith all cadets who graduated between 1840 and 1846--seven classes.\r\nThese classes embraced more than fifty officers who afterwards became\r\ngenerals on one side or the other in the rebellion, many of them holding\r\nhigh commands.  All the older officers, who became conspicuous in the\r\nrebellion, I had also served with and known in Mexico:  Lee, J. E.\r\nJohnston, A. S. Johnston, Holmes, Hebert and a number of others on the\r\nConfederate side; McCall, Mansfield, Phil. Kearney and others on the\r\nNational side.  The acquaintance thus formed was of immense service to\r\nme in the war of the rebellion--I mean what I learned of the characters\r\nof those to whom I was afterwards opposed.  I do not pretend to say that\r\nall movements, or even many of them, were made with special reference to\r\nthe characteristics of the commander against whom they were directed.\r\nBut my appreciation of my enemies was certainly affected by this\r\nknowledge.  The natural disposition of most people is to clothe a\r\ncommander of a large army whom they do not know, with almost superhuman\r\nabilities.  A large part of the National army, for instance, and most of\r\nthe press of the country, clothed General Lee with just such qualities,\r\nbut I had known him personally, and knew that he was mortal; and it was\r\njust as well that I felt this.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of peace was at last ratified, and the evacuation of Mexico\r\nby United States troops was ordered.  Early in June the troops in the\r\nCity of Mexico began to move out.  Many of them, including the brigade\r\nto which I belonged, were assembled at Jalapa, above the vomito, to\r\nawait the arrival of transports at Vera Cruz:  but with all this\r\nprecaution my regiment and others were in camp on the sand beach in a\r\nJuly sun, for about a week before embarking, while the fever raged with\r\ngreat virulence in Vera Cruz, not two miles away.  I can call to mind\r\nonly one person, an officer, who died of the disease.  My regiment was\r\nsent to Pascagoula, Mississippi, to spend the summer.  As soon as it was\r\nsettled in camp I obtained a leave of absence for four months and\r\nproceeded to St. Louis.  On the 22d of August, 1848, I was married to\r\nMiss Julia Dent, the lady of whom I have before spoken.  We visited my\r\nparents and relations in Ohio, and, at the end of my leave, proceeded to\r\nmy post at Sackett's Harbor, New York.  In April following I was ordered\r\nto Detroit, Michigan, where two years were spent with but few important\r\nincidents.\r\n\r\nThe present constitution of the State of Michigan was ratified during\r\nthis time.  By the terms of one of its provisions, all citizens of the\r\nUnited States residing within the State at the time of the ratification\r\nbecame citizens of Michigan also. During my stay in Detroit there was an\r\nelection for city officers.  Mr. Zachariah Chandler was the candidate of\r\nthe Whigs for the office of Mayor, and was elected, although the city\r\nwas then reckoned democratic.  All the officers stationed there at the\r\ntime who offered their votes were permitted to cast them.  I did not\r\noffer mine, however, as I did not wish to consider myself a citizen of\r\nMichigan.  This was Mr. Chandler's first entry into politics, a career\r\nhe followed ever after with great success, and in which he died enjoying\r\nthe friendship, esteem and love of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1851 the garrison at Detroit was transferred to\r\nSackett's Harbor, and in the following spring the entire 4th infantry\r\nwas ordered to the Pacific Coast.  It was decided that Mrs. Grant should\r\nvisit my parents at first for a few months, and then remain with her own\r\nfamily at their St. Louis home until an opportunity offered of sending\r\nfor her.  In the month of April the regiment was assembled at Governor's\r\nIsland, New York Harbor, and on the 5th of July eight companies sailed\r\nfor Aspinwall.  We numbered a little over seven hundred persons,\r\nincluding the families of officers and soldiers.  Passage was secured\r\nfor us on the old steamer Ohio, commanded at the time by Captain\r\nSchenck, of the navy.  It had not been determined, until a day or two\r\nbefore starting, that the 4th infantry should go by the Ohio;\r\nconsequently, a complement of passengers had already been secured.  The\r\naddition of over seven hundred to this list crowded the steamer most\r\nuncomfortably, especially for the tropics in July.\r\n\r\nIn eight days Aspinwall was reached.  At that time the streets of the\r\ntown were eight or ten inches under water, and foot passengers passed\r\nfrom place to place on raised foot-walks. July is at the height of the\r\nwet season, on the Isthmus.  At intervals the rain would pour down in\r\nstreams, followed in not many minutes by a blazing, tropical summer's\r\nsun.  These alternate changes, from rain to sunshine, were continuous in\r\nthe afternoons.  I wondered how any person could live many months in\r\nAspinwall, and wondered still more why any one tried.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1852 the Panama railroad was completed only to the\r\npoint where it now crosses the Chagres River.  From there passengers\r\nwere carried by boats to Gorgona, at which place they took mules for\r\nPanama, some twenty-five miles further.  Those who travelled over the\r\nIsthmus in those days will remember that boats on the Chagres River were\r\npropelled by natives not inconveniently burdened with clothing.  These\r\nboats carried thirty to forty passengers each.  The crews consisted of\r\nsix men to a boat, armed with long poles.  There were planks wide enough\r\nfor a man to walk on conveniently, running along the sides of each boat\r\nfrom end to end.  The men would start from the bow, place one end of\r\ntheir poles against the river bottom, brace their shoulders against the\r\nother end, and then walk to the stern as rapidly as they could.  In this\r\nway from a mile to a mile and a half an hour could be made, against the\r\ncurrent of the river.\r\n\r\nI, as regimental quartermaster, had charge of the public property and\r\nhad also to look after the transportation.  A contract had been entered\r\ninto with the steamship company in New York for the transportation of\r\nthe regiment to California, including the Isthmus transit.  A certain\r\namount of baggage was allowed per man, and saddle animals were to be\r\nfurnished to commissioned officers and to all disabled persons.  The\r\nregiment, with the exception of one company left as guards to the public\r\nproperty--camp and garrison equipage principally--and the soldiers with\r\nfamilies, took boats, propelled as above described, for Gorgona.  From\r\nthis place they marched to Panama, and were soon comfortably on the\r\nsteamer anchored in the bay, some three or four miles from the town.  I,\r\nwith one company of troops and all the soldiers with families, all the\r\ntents, mess chests and camp kettles, was sent to Cruces, a town a few\r\nmiles higher up the Chagres River than Gorgona.  There I found an\r\nimpecunious American who had taken the contract to furnish\r\ntransportation for the regiment at a stipulated price per hundred pounds\r\nfor the freight and so much for each saddle animal.  But when we reached\r\nCruces there was not a mule, either for pack or saddle, in the place.\r\nThe contractor promised that the animals should be on hand in the\r\nmorning.  In the morning he said that they were on the way from some\r\nimaginary place, and would arrive in the course of the day.  This went\r\non until I saw that he could not procure the animals at all at the price\r\nhe had promised to furnish them for.  The unusual number of passengers\r\nthat had come over on the steamer, and the large amount of freight to\r\npack, had created an unprecedented demand for mules.  Some of the\r\npassengers paid as high as forty dollars for the use of a mule to ride\r\ntwenty-five miles, when the mule would not have sold for ten dollars in\r\nthat market at other times. Meanwhile the cholera had broken out, and\r\nmen were dying every hour.  To diminish the food for the disease, I\r\npermitted the company detailed with me to proceed to Panama.  The\r\ncaptain and the doctors accompanied the men, and I was left alone with\r\nthe sick and the soldiers who had families.  The regiment at Panama was\r\nalso affected with the disease; but there were better accommodations for\r\nthe well on the steamer, and a hospital, for those taken with the\r\ndisease, on an old hulk anchored a mile off.  There were also hospital\r\ntents on shore on the island of Flamingo, which stands in the bay.\r\n\r\nI was about a week at Cruces before transportation began to come in.\r\nAbout one-third of the people with me died, either at Cruces or on the\r\nway to Panama.  There was no agent of the transportation company at\r\nCruces to consult, or to take the responsibility of procuring\r\ntransportation at a price which would secure it.  I therefore myself\r\ndismissed the contractor and made a new contract with a native, at more\r\nthan double the original price.  Thus we finally reached Panama.  The\r\nsteamer, however, could not proceed until the cholera abated, and the\r\nregiment was detained still longer.  Altogether, on the Isthmus and on\r\nthe Pacific side, we were delayed six weeks.  About one-seventh of those\r\nwho left New York harbor with the 4th infantry on the 5th of July, now\r\nlie buried on the Isthmus of Panama or on Flamingo island in Panama Bay.\r\n\r\nOne amusing circumstance occurred while we were lying at anchor in\r\nPanama Bay.  In the regiment there was a Lieutenant Slaughter who was\r\nvery liable to sea-sickness.  It almost made him sick to see the wave of\r\na table-cloth when the servants were spreading it.  Soon after his\r\ngraduation, Slaughter was ordered to California and took passage by a\r\nsailing vessel going around Cape Horn.  The vessel was seven months\r\nmaking the voyage, and Slaughter was sick every moment of the time,\r\nnever more so than while lying at anchor after reaching his place of\r\ndestination. On landing in California he found orders which had come by\r\nthe Isthmus, notifying him of a mistake in his assignment; he should\r\nhave been ordered to the northern lakes.  He started back by the Isthmus\r\nroute and was sick all the way.  But when he arrived at the East he was\r\nagain ordered to California, this time definitely, and at this date was\r\nmaking his third trip.  He was as sick as ever, and had been so for more\r\nthan a month while lying at anchor in the bay.  I remember him well,\r\nseated with his elbows on the table in front of him, his chin between\r\nhis hands, and looking the picture of despair.  At last he broke out, \"I\r\nwish I had taken my father's advice; he wanted me to go into the navy;\r\nif I had done so, I should not have had to go to sea so much.\"  Poor\r\nSlaughter! it was his last sea voyage.  He was killed by Indians in\r\nOregon.\r\n\r\nBy the last of August the cholera had so abated that it was deemed safe\r\nto start.  The disease did not break out again on the way to California,\r\nand we reached San Francisco early in September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO--EARLY CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCES--LIFE ON THE PACIFIC COAST\r\n--PROMOTED CAPTAIN--FLUSH TIMES IN CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco at that day was a lively place.  Gold, or placer digging\r\nas it was called, was at its height.  Steamers plied daily between San\r\nFrancisco and both Stockton and Sacramento. Passengers and gold from the\r\nsouthern mines came by the Stockton boat; from the northern mines by\r\nSacramento.  In the evening when these boats arrived, Long Wharf--there\r\nwas but one wharf in San Francisco in 1852--was alive with people\r\ncrowding to meet the miners as they came down to sell their \"dust\" and\r\nto \"have a time.\"  Of these some were runners for hotels, boarding\r\nhouses or restaurants; others belonged to a class of impecunious\r\nadventurers, of good manners and good presence, who were ever on the\r\nalert to make the acquaintance of people with some ready means, in the\r\nhope of being asked to take a meal at a restaurant.  Many were young men\r\nof good family, good education and gentlemanly instincts.  Their parents\r\nhad been able to support them during their minority, and to give them\r\ngood educations, but not to maintain them afterwards.  From 1849 to 1853\r\nthere was a rush of people to the Pacific coast, of the class described.\r\nAll thought that fortunes were to be picked up, without effort, in the\r\ngold fields on the Pacific.  Some realized more than their most sanguine\r\nexpectations; but for one such there were hundreds disappointed, many of\r\nwhom now fill unknown graves; others died wrecks of their former selves,\r\nand many, without a vicious instinct, became criminals and outcasts.\r\nMany of the real scenes in early California life exceed in strangeness\r\nand interest any of the mere products of the brain of the novelist.\r\n\r\nThose early days in California brought out character.  It was a long way\r\noff then, and the journey was expensive.  The fortunate could go by Cape\r\nHorn or by the Isthmus of Panama; but the mass of pioneers crossed the\r\nplains with their ox-teams.  This took an entire summer.  They were very\r\nlucky when they got through with a yoke of worn-out cattle.  All other\r\nmeans were exhausted in procuring the outfit on the Missouri River.  The\r\nimmigrant, on arriving, found himself a stranger, in a strange land, far\r\nfrom friends.  Time pressed, for the little means that could be realized\r\nfrom the sale of what was left of the outfit would not support a man\r\nlong at California prices.  Many became discouraged.  Others would take\r\noff their coats and look for a job, no matter what it might be.  These\r\nsucceeded as a rule. There were many young men who had studied\r\nprofessions before they went to California, and who had never done a\r\nday's manual labor in their lives, who took in the situation at once and\r\nwent to work to make a start at anything they could get to do.  Some\r\nsupplied carpenters and masons with material--carrying plank, brick, or\r\nmortar, as the case might be; others drove stages, drays, or baggage\r\nwagons, until they could do better.  More became discouraged early and\r\nspent their time looking up people who would \"treat,\" or lounging about\r\nrestaurants and gambling houses where free lunches were furnished daily.\r\nThey were welcomed at these places because they often brought in miners\r\nwho proved good customers.\r\n\r\nMy regiment spent a few weeks at Benicia barracks, and then was ordered\r\nto Fort Vancouver, on the Columbia River, then in Oregon Territory.\r\nDuring the winter of 1852-3 the territory was divided, all north of the\r\nColumbia River being taken from Oregon to make Washington Territory.\r\n\r\nPrices for all kinds of supplies were so high on the Pacific coast from\r\n1849 until at least 1853--that it would have been impossible for\r\nofficers of the army to exist upon their pay, if it had not been that\r\nauthority was given them to purchase from the commissary such supplies\r\nas he kept, at New Orleans wholesale prices.  A cook could not be hired\r\nfor the pay of a captain.  The cook could do better.  At Benicia, in\r\n1852, flour was 25 cents per pound; potatoes were 16 cents; beets,\r\nturnips and cabbage, 6 cents; onions, 37 1/2 cents; meat and other\r\narticles in proportion.  In 1853 at Vancouver vegetables were a little\r\nlower.  I with three other officers concluded that we would raise a crop\r\nfor ourselves, and by selling the surplus realize something handsome.  I\r\nbought a pair of horses that had crossed the plains that summer and were\r\nvery poor.  They recuperated rapidly, however, and proved a good team to\r\nbreak up the ground with.  I performed all the labor of breaking up the\r\nground while the other officers planted the potatoes.  Our crop was\r\nenormous.  Luckily for us the Columbia River rose to a great height from\r\nthe melting of the snow in the mountains in June, and overflowed and\r\nkilled most of our crop.  This saved digging it up, for everybody on the\r\nPacific coast seemed to have come to the conclusion at the same time\r\nthat agriculture would be profitable.  In 1853 more than three-quarters\r\nof the potatoes raised were permitted to rot in the ground, or had to be\r\nthrown away.  The only potatoes we sold were to our own mess.\r\n\r\nWhile I was stationed on the Pacific coast we were free from Indian\r\nwars.  There were quite a number of remnants of tribes in the vicinity\r\nof Portland in Oregon, and of Fort Vancouver in Washington Territory.\r\nThey had generally acquired some of the vices of civilization, but none\r\nof the virtues, except in individual cases.  The Hudson's Bay Company\r\nhad held the North-west with their trading posts for many years before\r\nthe United States was represented on the Pacific coast.  They still\r\nretained posts along the Columbia River and one at Fort Vancouver, when\r\nI was there.  Their treatment of the Indians had brought out the better\r\nqualities of the savages.  Farming had been undertaken by the company to\r\nsupply the Indians with bread and vegetables; they raised some cattle\r\nand horses; and they had now taught the Indians to do the labor of the\r\nfarm and herd. They always compensated them for their labor, and always\r\ngave them goods of uniform quality and at uniform price.\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of the American, the medium of exchange between the\r\nIndian and the white man was pelts.  Afterward it was silver coin.  If\r\nan Indian received in the sale of a horse a fifty dollar gold piece, not\r\nan infrequent occurrence, the first thing he did was to exchange it for\r\nAmerican half dollars. These he could count.  He would then commence his\r\npurchases, paying for each article separately, as he got it.  He would\r\nnot trust any one to add up the bill and pay it all at once.  At that\r\nday fifty dollar gold pieces, not the issue of the government, were\r\ncommon on the Pacific coast.  They were called slugs.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, along the lower Columbia as far as the Cascades and on the\r\nlower Willamette, died off very fast during the year I spent in that\r\nsection; for besides acquiring the vices of the white people they had\r\nacquired also their diseases.  The measles and the small-pox were both\r\namazingly fatal.  In their wild state, before the appearance of the\r\nwhite man among them, the principal complaints they were subject to were\r\nthose produced by long involuntary fasting, violent exercise in pursuit\r\nof game, and over-eating.  Instinct more than reason had taught them a\r\nremedy for these ills.  It was the steam bath.  Something like a\r\nbake-oven was built, large enough to admit a man lying down. Bushes were\r\nstuck in the ground in two rows, about six feet long and some two or\r\nthree feet apart; other bushes connected the rows at one end.  The tops\r\nof the bushes were drawn together to interlace, and confined in that\r\nposition; the whole was then plastered over with wet clay until every\r\nopening was filled. Just inside the open end of the oven the floor was\r\nscooped out so as to make a hole that would hold a bucket or two of\r\nwater. These ovens were always built on the banks of a stream, a big\r\nspring, or pool of water.  When a patient required a bath, a fire was\r\nbuilt near the oven and a pile of stones put upon it. The cavity at the\r\nfront was then filled with water.  When the stones were sufficiently\r\nheated, the patient would draw himself into the oven; a blanket would be\r\nthrown over the open end, and hot stones put into the water until the\r\npatient could stand it no longer.  He was then withdrawn from his steam\r\nbath and doused into the cold stream near by.  This treatment may have\r\nanswered with the early ailments of the Indians.  With the measles or\r\nsmall-pox it would kill every time.\r\n\r\nDuring my year on the Columbia River, the small-pox exterminated one\r\nsmall remnant of a band of Indians entirely, and reduced others\r\nmaterially.  I do not think there was a case of recovery among them,\r\nuntil the doctor with the Hudson Bay Company took the matter in hand and\r\nestablished a hospital.  Nearly every case he treated recovered.  I\r\nnever, myself, saw the treatment described in the preceding paragraph,\r\nbut have heard it described by persons who have witnessed it.  The\r\ndecimation among the Indians I knew of personally, and the hospital,\r\nestablished for their benefit, was a Hudson's Bay building not a stone's\r\nthrow from my own quarters.\r\n\r\nThe death of Colonel Bliss, of the Adjutant General's department, which\r\noccurred July 5th, 1853, promoted me to the captaincy of a company then\r\nstationed at Humboldt Bay, California.  The notice reached me in\r\nSeptember of the same year, and I very soon started to join my new\r\ncommand.  There was no way of reaching Humboldt at that time except to\r\ntake passage on a San Francisco sailing vessel going after lumber.  Red\r\nwood, a species of cedar, which on the Pacific coast takes the place\r\nfilled by white pine in the East, then abounded on the banks of Humboldt\r\nBay.  There were extensive saw-mills engaged in preparing this lumber\r\nfor the San Francisco market, and sailing vessels, used in getting it to\r\nmarket, furnished the only means of communication between Humboldt and\r\nthe balance of the world.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to remain in San Francisco for several days before I found\r\na vessel.  This gave me a good opportunity of comparing the San\r\nFrancisco of 1852 with that of 1853.  As before stated, there had been\r\nbut one wharf in front of the city in 1852--Long Wharf.  In 1853 the\r\ntown had grown out into the bay beyond what was the end of this wharf\r\nwhen I first saw it.  Streets and houses had been built out on piles\r\nwhere the year before the largest vessels visiting the port lay at\r\nanchor or tied to the wharf.  There was no filling under the streets or\r\nhouses.  San Francisco presented the same general appearance as the year\r\nbefore; that is, eating, drinking and gambling houses were conspicuous\r\nfor their number and publicity.  They were on the first floor, with\r\ndoors wide open.  At all hours of the day and night in walking the\r\nstreets, the eye was regaled, on every block near the water front, by\r\nthe sight of players at faro. Often broken places were found in the\r\nstreet, large enough to let a man down into the water below.  I have but\r\nlittle doubt that many of the people who went to the Pacific coast in\r\nthe early days of the gold excitement, and have never been heard from\r\nsince, or who were heard from for a time and then ceased to write, found\r\nwatery graves beneath the houses or streets built over San Francisco\r\nBay.\r\n\r\nBesides the gambling in cards there was gambling on a larger scale in\r\ncity lots.  These were sold \"On Change,\" much as stocks are now sold on\r\nWall Street.  Cash, at time of purchase, was always paid by the broker;\r\nbut the purchaser had only to put up his margin.  He was charged at the\r\nrate of two or three per cent. a month on the difference, besides\r\ncommissions.  The sand hills, some of them almost inaccessible to\r\nfoot-passengers, were surveyed off and mapped into fifty vara lots--a\r\nvara being a Spanish yard.  These were sold at first at very low prices,\r\nbut were sold and resold for higher prices until they went up to many\r\nthousands of dollars.  The brokers did a fine business, and so did many\r\nsuch purchasers as were sharp enough to quit purchasing before the final\r\ncrash came.  As the city grew, the sand hills back of the town furnished\r\nmaterial for filling up the bay under the houses and streets, and still\r\nfurther out. The temporary houses, first built over the water in the\r\nharbor, soon gave way to more solid structures.  The main business part\r\nof the city now is on solid ground, made where vessels of the largest\r\nclass lay at anchor in the early days.  I was in San Francisco again in\r\n1854.  Gambling houses had disappeared from public view.  The city had\r\nbecome staid and orderly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nRESIGNATION--PRIVATE LIFE--LIFE AT GALENA--THE COMING CRISIS.\r\n\r\nMy family, all this while, was at the East.  It consisted now of a wife\r\nand two children.  I saw no chance of supporting them on the Pacific\r\ncoast out of my pay as an army officer.  I concluded, therefore, to\r\nresign, and in March applied for a leave of absence until the end of the\r\nJuly following, tendering my resignation to take effect at the end of\r\nthat time.  I left the Pacific coast very much attached to it, and with\r\nthe full expectation of making it my future home.  That expectation and\r\nthat hope remained uppermost in my mind until the Lieutenant-Generalcy\r\nbill was introduced into Congress in the winter of 1863-4.  The passage\r\nof that bill, and my promotion, blasted my last hope of ever becoming a\r\ncitizen of the further West.\r\n\r\nIn the late summer of 1854 I rejoined my family, to find in it a son\r\nwhom I had never seen, born while I was on the Isthmus of Panama.  I was\r\nnow to commence, at the age of thirty-two, a new struggle for our\r\nsupport.  My wife had a farm near St. Louis, to which we went, but I had\r\nno means to stock it.  A house had to be built also.  I worked very\r\nhard, never losing a day because of bad weather, and accomplished the\r\nobject in a moderate way.  If nothing else could be done I would load a\r\ncord of wood on a wagon and take it to the city for sale.  I managed to\r\nkeep along very well until 1858, when I was attacked by fever and ague.\r\nI had suffered very severely and for a long time from this disease,\r\nwhile a boy in Ohio.  It lasted now over a year, and, while it did not\r\nkeep me in the house, it did interfere greatly with the amount of work I\r\nwas able to perform.  In the fall of 1858 I sold out my stock, crops and\r\nfarming utensils at auction, and gave up farming.\r\n\r\nIn the winter I established a partnership with Harry Boggs, a cousin of\r\nMrs.  Grant, in the real estate agency business.  I spent that winter at\r\nSt. Louis myself, but did not take my family into town until the spring.\r\nOur business might have become prosperous if I had been able to wait for\r\nit to grow.  As it was, there was no more than one person could attend\r\nto, and not enough to support two families.  While a citizen of St.\r\nLouis and engaged in the real estate agency business, I was a candidate\r\nfor the office of county engineer, an office of respectability and\r\nemolument which would have been very acceptable to me at that time.  The\r\nincumbent was appointed by the county court, which consisted of five\r\nmembers.  My opponent had the advantage of birth over me (he was a\r\ncitizen by adoption) and carried off the prize.  I now withdrew from the\r\nco-partnership with Boggs, and, in May, 1860, removed to Galena,\r\nIllinois, and took a clerkship in my father's store.\r\n\r\nWhile a citizen of Missouri, my first opportunity for casting a vote at\r\na Presidential election occurred.  I had been in the army from before\r\nattaining my majority and had thought but little about politics,\r\nalthough I was a Whig by education and a great admirer of Mr. Clay.  But\r\nthe Whig party had ceased to exist before I had an opportunity of\r\nexercising the privilege of casting a ballot; the Know-Nothing party had\r\ntaken its place, but was on the wane; and the Republican party was in a\r\nchaotic state and had not yet received a name.  It had no existence in\r\nthe Slave States except at points on the borders next to Free States.\r\nIn St. Louis City and County, what afterwards became the Republican\r\nparty was known as the Free-Soil Democracy, led by the Honorable Frank\r\nP. Blair.  Most of my neighbors had known me as an officer of the army\r\nwith Whig proclivities.  They had been on the same side, and, on the\r\ndeath of their party, many had become Know-Nothings, or members of the\r\nAmerican party. There was a lodge near my new home, and I was invited to\r\njoin it.  I accepted the invitation; was initiated; attended a meeting\r\njust one week later, and never went to another afterwards.\r\n\r\nI have no apologies to make for having been one week a member of the\r\nAmerican party; for I still think native-born citizens of the United\r\nStates should have as much protection, as many privileges in their\r\nnative country, as those who voluntarily select it for a home.  But all\r\nsecret, oath-bound political parties are dangerous to any nation, no\r\nmatter how pure or how patriotic the motives and principles which first\r\nbring them together.  No political party can or ought to exist when one\r\nof its corner-stones is opposition to freedom of thought and to the\r\nright to worship God \"according to the dictate of one's own conscience,\"\r\nor according to the creed of any religious denomination whatever.\r\nNevertheless, if a sect sets up its laws as binding above the State\r\nlaws, wherever the two come in conflict this claim must be resisted and\r\nsuppressed at whatever cost.\r\n\r\nUp to the Mexican war there were a few out and out abolitionists, men\r\nwho carried their hostility to slavery into all elections, from those\r\nfor a justice of the peace up to the Presidency of the United States.\r\nThey were noisy but not numerous.  But the great majority of people at\r\nthe North, where slavery did not exist, were opposed to the institution,\r\nand looked upon its existence in any part of the country as unfortunate.\r\nThey did not hold the States where slavery existed responsible for it;\r\nand believed that protection should be given to the right of property in\r\nslaves until some satisfactory way could be reached to be rid of the\r\ninstitution.  Opposition to slavery was not a creed of either political\r\nparty.  In some sections more anti-slavery men belonged to the\r\nDemocratic party, and in others to the Whigs.  But with the inauguration\r\nof the Mexican war, in fact with the annexation of Texas, \"the\r\ninevitable conflict\" commenced.\r\n\r\nAs the time for the Presidential election of 1856--the first at which I\r\nhad the opportunity of voting--approached, party feeling began to run\r\nhigh.  The Republican party was regarded in the South and the border\r\nStates not only as opposed to the extension of slavery, but as favoring\r\nthe compulsory abolition of the institution without compensation to the\r\nowners.  The most horrible visions seemed to present themselves to the\r\nminds of people who, one would suppose, ought to have known better.\r\nMany educated and, otherwise, sensible persons appeared to believe that\r\nemancipation meant social equality.  Treason to the Government was\r\nopenly advocated and was not rebuked.  It was evident to my mind that\r\nthe election of a Republican President in 1856 meant the secession of\r\nall the Slave States, and rebellion.  Under these circumstances I\r\npreferred the success of a candidate whose election would prevent or\r\npostpone secession, to seeing the country plunged into a war the end of\r\nwhich no man could foretell.  With a Democrat elected by the unanimous\r\nvote of the Slave States, there could be no pretext for secession for\r\nfour years.  I very much hoped that the passions of the people would\r\nsubside in that time, and the catastrophe be averted altogether; if it\r\nwas not, I believed the country would be better prepared to receive the\r\nshock and to resist it.  I therefore voted for James Buchanan for\r\nPresident.  Four years later the Republican party was successful in\r\nelecting its candidate to the Presidency.  The civilized world has\r\nlearned the consequence.  Four millions of human beings held as chattels\r\nhave been liberated; the ballot has been given to them; the free schools\r\nof the country have been opened to their children.  The nation still\r\nlives, and the people are just as free to avoid social intimacy with the\r\nblacks as ever they were, or as they are with white people.\r\n\r\nWhile living in Galena I was nominally only a clerk supporting myself\r\nand family on a stipulated salary.  In reality my position was\r\ndifferent.  My father had never lived in Galena himself, but had\r\nestablished my two brothers there, the one next younger than myself in\r\ncharge of the business, assisted by the youngest.  When I went there it\r\nwas my father's intention to give up all connection with the business\r\nhimself, and to establish his three sons in it:  but the brother who had\r\nreally built up the business was sinking with consumption, and it was\r\nnot thought best to make any change while he was in this condition.  He\r\nlived until September, 1861, when he succumbed to that insidious disease\r\nwhich always flatters its victims into the belief that they are growing\r\nbetter up to the close of life.  A more honorable man never transacted\r\nbusiness.  In September, 1861, I was engaged in an employment which\r\nrequired all my attention elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDuring the eleven months that I lived in Galena prior to the first call\r\nfor volunteers, I had been strictly attentive to my business, and had\r\nmade but few acquaintances other than customers and people engaged in\r\nthe same line with myself.  When the election took place in November,\r\n1860, I had not been a resident of Illinois long enough to gain\r\ncitizenship and could not, therefore, vote.  I was really glad of this\r\nat the time, for my pledges would have compelled me to vote for Stephen\r\nA. Douglas, who had no possible chance of election.  The contest was\r\nreally between Mr. Breckinridge and Mr. Lincoln; between minority rule\r\nand rule by the majority.  I wanted, as between these candidates, to see\r\nMr. Lincoln elected.  Excitement ran high during the canvass, and\r\ntorch-light processions enlivened the scene in the generally quiet\r\nstreets of Galena many nights during the campaign.  I did not parade\r\nwith either party, but occasionally met with the \"wide awakes\"\r\n--Republicans--in their rooms, and superintended their drill.  It was\r\nevident, from the time of the Chicago nomination to the close of the\r\ncanvass, that the election of the Republican candidate would be the\r\nsignal for some of the Southern States to secede.  I still had hopes\r\nthat the four years which had elapsed since the first nomination of a\r\nPresidential candidate by a party distinctly opposed to slavery\r\nextension, had given time for the extreme pro-slavery sentiment to cool\r\ndown; for the Southerners to think well before they took the awful leap\r\nwhich they had so vehemently threatened.  But I was mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe Republican candidate was elected, and solid substantial people of\r\nthe North-west, and I presume the same order of people throughout the\r\nentire North, felt very serious, but determined, after this event.  It\r\nwas very much discussed whether the South would carry out its threat to\r\nsecede and set up a separate government, the corner-stone of which\r\nshould be, protection to the \"Divine\" institution of slavery.  For there\r\nwere people who believed in the \"divinity\" of human slavery, as there\r\nare now people who believe Mormonism and Polygamy to be ordained by the\r\nMost High.  We forgive them for entertaining such notions, but forbid\r\ntheir practice.  It was generally believed that there would be a flurry;\r\nthat some of the extreme Southern States would go so far as to pass\r\nordinances of secession.  But the common impression was that this step\r\nwas so plainly suicidal for the South, that the movement would not\r\nspread over much of the territory and would not last long.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the founders of our government, the majority of them at least,\r\nregarded the confederation of the colonies as an experiment.  Each\r\ncolony considered itself a separate government; that the confederation\r\nwas for mutual protection against a foreign foe, and the prevention of\r\nstrife and war among themselves.  If there had been a desire on the part\r\nof any single State to withdraw from the compact at any time while the\r\nnumber of States was limited to the original thirteen, I do not suppose\r\nthere would have been any to contest the right, no matter how much the\r\ndetermination might have been regretted. The problem changed on the\r\nratification of the Constitution by all the colonies; it changed still\r\nmore when amendments were added; and if the right of any one State to\r\nwithdraw continued to exist at all after the ratification of the\r\nConstitution, it certainly ceased on the formation of new States, at\r\nleast so far as the new States themselves were concerned.  It was never\r\npossessed at all by Florida or the States west of the Mississippi, all\r\nof which were purchased by the treasury of the entire nation. Texas and\r\nthe territory brought into the Union in consequence of annexation, were\r\npurchased with both blood and treasure; and Texas, with a domain greater\r\nthan that of any European state except Russia, was permitted to retain\r\nas state property all the public lands within its borders.  It would\r\nhave been ingratitude and injustice of the most flagrant sort for this\r\nState to withdraw from the Union after all that had been spent and done\r\nto introduce her; yet, if separation had actually occurred, Texas must\r\nnecessarily have gone with the South, both on account of her\r\ninstitutions and her geographical position. Secession was illogical as\r\nwell as impracticable; it was revolution.\r\n\r\nNow, the right of revolution is an inherent one.  When people are\r\noppressed by their government, it is a natural right they enjoy to\r\nrelieve themselves of the oppression, if they are strong enough, either\r\nby withdrawal from it, or by overthrowing it and substituting a\r\ngovernment more acceptable.  But any people or part of a people who\r\nresort to this remedy, stake their lives, their property, and every\r\nclaim for protection given by citizenship--on the issue.  Victory, or\r\nthe conditions imposed by the conqueror--must be the result.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the war between the States it would have been the exact\r\ntruth if the South had said,--\"We do not want to live with you Northern\r\npeople any longer; we know our institution of slavery is obnoxious to\r\nyou, and, as you are growing numerically stronger than we, it may at\r\nsome time in the future be endangered.  So long as you permitted us to\r\ncontrol the government, and with the aid of a few friends at the North\r\nto enact laws constituting your section a guard against the escape of\r\nour property, we were willing to live with you.  You have been\r\nsubmissive to our rule heretofore; but it looks now as if you did not\r\nintend to continue so, and we will remain in the Union no longer.\"\r\nInstead of this the seceding States cried lustily,--\"Let us alone; you\r\nhave no constitutional power to interfere with us.\"  Newspapers and\r\npeople at the North reiterated the cry.  Individuals might ignore the\r\nconstitution; but the Nation itself must not only obey it, but must\r\nenforce the strictest construction of that instrument; the construction\r\nput upon it by the Southerners themselves.  The fact is the constitution\r\ndid not apply to any such contingency as the one existing from 1861 to\r\n1865.  Its framers never dreamed of such a contingency occurring.  If\r\nthey had foreseen it, the probabilities are they would have sanctioned\r\nthe right of a State or States to withdraw rather than that there should\r\nbe war between brothers.\r\n\r\nThe framers were wise in their generation and wanted to do the very best\r\npossible to secure their own liberty and independence, and that also of\r\ntheir descendants to the latest days.  It is preposterous to suppose\r\nthat the people of one generation can lay down the best and only rules\r\nof government for all who are to come after them, and under unforeseen\r\ncontingencies.  At the time of the framing of our constitution the only\r\nphysical forces that had been subdued and made to serve man and do his\r\nlabor, were the currents in the streams and in the air we breathe. Rude\r\nmachinery, propelled by water power, had been invented; sails to propel\r\nships upon the waters had been set to catch the passing breeze--but the\r\napplication of steam to propel vessels against both wind and current,\r\nand machinery to do all manner of work had not been thought of.  The\r\ninstantaneous transmission of messages around the world by means of\r\nelectricity would probably at that day have been attributed to\r\nwitchcraft or a league with the Devil.  Immaterial circumstances had\r\nchanged as greatly as material ones.  We could not and ought not to be\r\nrigidly bound by the rules laid down under circumstances so different\r\nfor emergencies so utterly unanticipated.  The fathers themselves would\r\nhave been the first to declare that their prerogatives were not\r\nirrevocable.  They would surely have resisted secession could they have\r\nlived to see the shape it assumed.\r\n\r\nI travelled through the Northwest considerably during the winter of\r\n1860-1.  We had customers in all the little towns in south-west\r\nWisconsin, south-east Minnesota and north-east Iowa.  These generally\r\nknew I had been a captain in the regular army and had served through the\r\nMexican war.  Consequently wherever I stopped at night, some of the\r\npeople would come to the public-house where I was, and sit till a late\r\nhour discussing the probabilities of the future.  My own views at that\r\ntime were like those officially expressed by Mr. Seward at a later day,\r\nthat \"the war would be over in ninety days.\"  I continued to entertain\r\nthese views until after the battle of Shiloh.  I believe now that there\r\nwould have been no more battles at the West after the capture of Fort\r\nDonelson if all the troops in that region had been under a single\r\ncommander who would have followed up that victory.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt in my mind now that the prevailing sentiment of\r\nthe South would have been opposed to secession in 1860 and 1861, if\r\nthere had been a fair and calm expression of opinion, unbiased by\r\nthreats, and if the ballot of one legal voter had counted for as much as\r\nthat of any other.  But there was no calm discussion of the question.\r\nDemagogues who were too old to enter the army if there should be a war,\r\nothers who entertained so high an opinion of their own ability that they\r\ndid not believe they could be spared from the direction of the affairs\r\nof state in such an event, declaimed vehemently and unceasingly against\r\nthe North; against its aggressions upon the South; its interference with\r\nSouthern rights, etc., etc.  They denounced the Northerners as cowards,\r\npoltroons, negro-worshippers; claimed that one Southern man was equal to\r\nfive Northern men in battle; that if the South would stand up for its\r\nrights the North would back down.  Mr. Jefferson Davis said in a speech,\r\ndelivered at La Grange, Mississippi, before the secession of that State,\r\nthat he would agree to drink all the blood spilled south of Mason and\r\nDixon's line if there should be a war.  The young men who would have the\r\nfighting to do in case of war, believed all these statements, both in\r\nregard to the aggressiveness of the North and its cowardice.  They, too,\r\ncried out for a separation from such people.  The great bulk of the\r\nlegal voters of the South were men who owned no slaves; their homes were\r\ngenerally in the hills and poor country; their facilities for educating\r\ntheir children, even up to the point of reading and writing, were very\r\nlimited; their interest in the contest was very meagre--what there was,\r\nif they had been capable of seeing it, was with the North; they too\r\nneeded emancipation.  Under the old regime they were looked down upon by\r\nthose who controlled all the affairs in the interest of slave-owners, as\r\npoor white trash who were allowed the ballot so long as they cast it\r\naccording to direction.\r\n\r\nI am aware that this last statement may be disputed and individual\r\ntestimony perhaps adduced to show that in ante-bellum days the ballot\r\nwas as untrammelled in the south as in any section of the country; but\r\nin the face of any such contradiction I reassert the statement.  The\r\nshot-gun was not resorted to.  Masked men did not ride over the country\r\nat night intimidating voters; but there was a firm feeling that a class\r\nexisted in every State with a sort of divine right to control public\r\naffairs.  If they could not get this control by one means they must by\r\nanother.  The end justified the means.  The coercion, if mild, was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThere were two political parties, it is true, in all the States, both\r\nstrong in numbers and respectability, but both equally loyal to the\r\ninstitution which stood paramount in Southern eyes to all other\r\ninstitutions in state or nation.  The slave-owners were the minority,\r\nbut governed both parties.  Had politics ever divided the slave-holders\r\nand the non-slave-holders, the majority would have been obliged to\r\nyield, or internecine war would have been the consequence.  I do not\r\nknow that the Southern people were to blame for this condition of\r\naffairs. There was a time when slavery was not profitable, and the\r\ndiscussion of the merits of the institution was confined almost\r\nexclusively to the territory where it existed.  The States of Virginia\r\nand Kentucky came near abolishing slavery by their own acts, one State\r\ndefeating the measure by a tie vote and the other only lacking one.  But\r\nwhen the institution became profitable, all talk of its abolition ceased\r\nwhere it existed; and naturally, as human nature is constituted,\r\narguments were adduced in its support.  The cotton-gin probably had much\r\nto do with the justification of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1860-1 will be remembered by middle-aged people of to-day\r\nas one of great excitement.  South Carolina promptly seceded after the\r\nresult of the Presidential election was known.  Other Southern States\r\nproposed to follow.  In some of them the Union sentiment was so strong\r\nthat it had to be suppressed by force.  Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky and\r\nMissouri, all Slave States, failed to pass ordinances of secession; but\r\nthey were all represented in the so-called congress of the so-called\r\nConfederate States.  The Governor and Lieutenant-Governor of Missouri,\r\nin 1861, Jackson and Reynolds, were both supporters of the rebellion and\r\ntook refuge with the enemy.  The governor soon died, and the\r\nlieutenant-governor assumed his office; issued proclamations as governor\r\nof the State; was recognized as such by the Confederate Government, and\r\ncontinued his pretensions until the collapse of the rebellion. The South\r\nclaimed the sovereignty of States, but claimed the right to coerce into\r\ntheir confederation such States as they wanted, that is, all the States\r\nwhere slavery existed.  They did not seem to think this course\r\ninconsistent.  The fact is, the Southern slave-owners believed that, in\r\nsome way, the ownership of slaves conferred a sort of patent of\r\nnobility--a right to govern independent of the interest or wishes of\r\nthose who did not hold such property.  They convinced themselves, first,\r\nof the divine origin of the institution and, next, that that particular\r\ninstitution was not safe in the hands of any body of legislators but\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Administration of President Buchanan looked helplessly on\r\nand proclaimed that the general government had no power to interfere;\r\nthat the Nation had no power to save its own life.  Mr. Buchanan had in\r\nhis cabinet two members at least, who were as earnest--to use a mild\r\nterm--in the cause of secession as Mr. Davis or any Southern statesman.\r\nOne of them, Floyd, the Secretary of War, scattered the army so that\r\nmuch of it could be captured when hostilities should commence, and\r\ndistributed the cannon and small arms from Northern arsenals throughout\r\nthe South so as to be on hand when treason wanted them.  The navy was\r\nscattered in like manner.  The President did not prevent his cabinet\r\npreparing for war upon their government, either by destroying its\r\nresources or storing them in the South until a de facto government was\r\nestablished with Jefferson Davis as its President, and Montgomery,\r\nAlabama, as the Capital.  The secessionists had then to leave the\r\ncabinet.  In their own estimation they were aliens in the country which\r\nhad given them birth.  Loyal men were put into their places.  Treason in\r\nthe executive branch of the government was estopped.  But the harm had\r\nalready been done.  The stable door was locked after the horse had been\r\nstolen.\r\n\r\nDuring all of the trying winter of 1860-1, when the Southerners were so\r\ndefiant that they would not allow within their borders the expression of\r\na sentiment hostile to their views, it was a brave man indeed who could\r\nstand up and proclaim his loyalty to the Union.  On the other hand men\r\nat the North--prominent men--proclaimed that the government had no power\r\nto coerce the South into submission to the laws of the land; that if the\r\nNorth undertook to raise armies to go south, these armies would have to\r\nmarch over the dead bodies of the speakers.  A portion of the press of\r\nthe North was constantly proclaiming similar views. When the time\r\narrived for the President-elect to go to the capital of the Nation to be\r\nsworn into office, it was deemed unsafe for him to travel, not only as a\r\nPresident-elect, but as any private citizen should be allowed to do.\r\nInstead of going in a special car, receiving the good wishes of his\r\nconstituents at all the stations along the road, he was obliged to stop\r\non the way and to be smuggled into the capital.  He disappeared from\r\npublic view on his journey, and the next the country knew, his arrival\r\nwas announced at the capital.  There is little doubt that he would have\r\nbeen assassinated if he had attempted to travel openly throughout his\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nOUTBREAK OF THE REBELLION--PRESIDING AT A UNION MEETING--MUSTERING\r\nOFFICER OF STATE TROOPS--LYON AT CAMP JACKSON--SERVICES TENDERED TO THE\r\nGOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe 4th of March, 1861, came, and Abraham Lincoln was sworn to maintain\r\nthe Union against all its enemies.  The secession of one State after\r\nanother followed, until eleven had gone out.  On the 11th of April Fort\r\nSumter, a National fort in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, was\r\nfired upon by the Southerners and a few days after was captured.  The\r\nConfederates proclaimed themselves aliens, and thereby debarred\r\nthemselves of all right to claim protection under the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.  We did not admit the fact that they were aliens, but\r\nall the same, they debarred themselves of the right to expect better\r\ntreatment than people of any other foreign state who make war upon an\r\nindependent nation.  Upon the firing on Sumter President Lincoln issued\r\nhis first call for troops and soon after a proclamation convening\r\nCongress in extra session.  The call was for 75,000 volunteers for\r\nninety days' service.  If the shot fired at Fort Sumter \"was heard\r\naround the world,\" the call of the President for 75,000 men was heard\r\nthroughout the Northern States.  There was not a state in the North of a\r\nmillion of inhabitants that would not have furnished the entire number\r\nfaster than arms could have been supplied to them, if it had been\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of the call for volunteers reached Galena, posters\r\nwere stuck up calling for a meeting of the citizens at the court-house\r\nin the evening.  Business ceased entirely; all was excitement; for a\r\ntime there were no party distinctions; all were Union men, determined to\r\navenge the insult to the national flag.  In the evening the court-house\r\nwas packed.  Although a comparative stranger I was called upon to\r\npreside; the sole reason, possibly, was that I had been in the army and\r\nhad seen service.  With much embarrassment and some prompting I made out\r\nto announce the object of the meeting.  Speeches were in order, but it\r\nis doubtful whether it would have been safe just then to make other than\r\npatriotic ones.  There was probably no one in the house, however, who\r\nfelt like making any other.  The two principal speeches were by B. B.\r\nHoward, the post-master and a Breckinridge Democrat at the November\r\nelection the fall before, and John A. Rawlins, an elector on the Douglas\r\nticket.  E. B. Washburne, with whom I was not acquainted at that time,\r\ncame in after the meeting had been organized, and expressed, I\r\nunderstood afterwards, a little surprise that Galena could not furnish a\r\npresiding officer for such an occasion without taking a stranger.  He\r\ncame forward and was introduced, and made a speech appealing to the\r\npatriotism of the meeting.\r\n\r\nAfter the speaking was over volunteers were called for to form a\r\ncompany.  The quota of Illinois had been fixed at six regiments; and it\r\nwas supposed that one company would be as much as would be accepted from\r\nGalena.  The company was raised and the officers and non-commissioned\r\nofficers elected before the meeting adjourned.  I declined the captaincy\r\nbefore the balloting, but announced that I would aid the company in\r\nevery way I could and would be found in the service in some position if\r\nthere should be a war.  I never went into our leather store after that\r\nmeeting, to put up a package or do other business.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Galena were quite as patriotic as the men.  They could not\r\nenlist, but they conceived the idea of sending their first company to\r\nthe field uniformed.  They came to me to get a description of the United\r\nStates uniform for infantry; subscribed and bought the material;\r\nprocured tailors to cut out the garments, and the ladies made them up.\r\nIn a few days the company was in uniform and ready to report at the\r\nState capital for assignment.  The men all turned out the morning after\r\ntheir enlistment, and I took charge, divided them into squads and\r\nsuperintended their drill.  When they were ready to go to Springfield I\r\nwent with them and remained there until they were assigned to a\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\nThere were so many more volunteers than had been called for that the\r\nquestion whom to accept was quite embarrassing to the governor, Richard\r\nYates.  The legislature was in session at the time, however, and came to\r\nhis relief.  A law was enacted authorizing the governor to accept the\r\nservices of ten additional regiments, one from each congressional\r\ndistrict, for one month, to be paid by the State, but pledged to go into\r\nthe service of the United States if there should be a further call\r\nduring their term.  Even with this relief the governor was still very\r\nmuch embarrassed.  Before the war was over he was like the President\r\nwhen he was taken with the varioloid:  \"at last he had something he\r\ncould give to all who wanted it.\"\r\n\r\nIn time the Galena company was mustered into the United States service,\r\nforming a part of the 11th Illinois volunteer infantry.  My duties, I\r\nthought, had ended at Springfield, and I was prepared to start home by\r\nthe evening train, leaving at nine o'clock.  Up to that time I do not\r\nthink I had been introduced to Governor Yates, or had ever spoken to\r\nhim.  I knew him by sight, however, because he was living at the same\r\nhotel and I often saw him at table.  The evening I was to quit the\r\ncapital I left the supper room before the governor and was standing at\r\nthe front door when he came out.  He spoke to me, calling me by my old\r\narmy title \"Captain,\" and said he understood that I was about leaving\r\nthe city.  I answered that I was.  He said he would be glad if I would\r\nremain over-night and call at the Executive office the next morning.\r\nI complied with his request, and was asked to go into the\r\nAdjutant-General's office and render such assistance as I could, the\r\ngovernor saying that my army experience would be of great service there.\r\nI accepted the proposition.\r\n\r\nMy old army experience I found indeed of very great service.  I was no\r\nclerk, nor had I any capacity to become one.  The only place I ever\r\nfound in my life to put a paper so as to find it again was either a side\r\ncoat-pocket or the hands of a clerk or secretary more careful than\r\nmyself.  But I had been quartermaster, commissary and adjutant in the\r\nfield.  The army forms were familiar to me and I could direct how they\r\nshould be made out.  There was a clerk in the office of the\r\nAdjutant-General who supplied my deficiencies.  The ease with which the\r\nState of Illinois settled its accounts with the government at the close\r\nof the war is evidence of the efficiency of Mr. Loomis as an accountant\r\non a large scale.  He remained in the office until that time.\r\n\r\nAs I have stated, the legislature authorized the governor to accept the\r\nservices of ten additional regiments.  I had charge of mustering these\r\nregiments into the State service.  They were assembled at the most\r\nconvenient railroad centres in their respective congressional districts.\r\nI detailed officers to muster in a portion of them, but mustered three\r\nin the southern part of the State myself.  One of these was to assemble\r\nat Belleville, some eighteen miles south-east of St. Louis.  When I got\r\nthere I found that only one or two companies had arrived. There was no\r\nprobability of the regiment coming together under five days.  This gave\r\nme a few idle days which I concluded to spend in St. Louis.\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable force of State militia at Camp Jackson, on the\r\noutskirts of St. Louis, at the time.  There is but little doubt that it\r\nwas the design of Governor Claiborn Jackson to have these troops ready\r\nto seize the United States arsenal and the city of St. Louis.  Why they\r\ndid not do so I do not know. There was but a small garrison, two\r\ncompanies I think, under Captain N. Lyon at the arsenal, and but for the\r\ntimely services of the Hon. F. P. Blair, I have little doubt that St.\r\nLouis would have gone into rebel hands, and with it the arsenal with all\r\nits arms and ammunition.\r\n\r\nBlair was a leader among the Union men of St. Louis in 1861. There was\r\nno State government in Missouri at the time that would sanction the\r\nraising of troops or commissioned officers to protect United States\r\nproperty, but Blair had probably procured some form of authority from\r\nthe President to raise troops in Missouri and to muster them into the\r\nservice of the United States.  At all events, he did raise a regiment\r\nand took command himself as Colonel.  With this force he reported to\r\nCaptain Lyon and placed himself and regiment under his orders.  It was\r\nwhispered that Lyon thus reinforced intended to break up Camp Jackson\r\nand capture the militia.  I went down to the arsenal in the morning to\r\nsee the troops start out.  I had known Lyon for two years at West Point\r\nand in the old army afterwards.  Blair I knew very well by sight.  I had\r\nheard him speak in the canvass of 1858, possibly several times, but I\r\nhad never spoken to him.  As the troops marched out of the enclosure\r\naround the arsenal, Blair was on his horse outside forming them into\r\nline preparatory to their march.  I introduced myself to him and had a\r\nfew moments' conversation and expressed my sympathy with his purpose.\r\nThis was my first personal acquaintance with the Honorable--afterwards\r\nMajor-General F. P. Blair.  Camp Jackson surrendered without a fight and\r\nthe garrison was marched down to the arsenal as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the enemies of the government in St. Louis had been bold\r\nand defiant, while Union men were quiet but determined.  The enemies had\r\ntheir head-quarters in a central and public position on Pine Street,\r\nnear Fifth--from which the rebel flag was flaunted boldly.  The Union\r\nmen had a place of meeting somewhere in the city, I did not know where,\r\nand I doubt whether they dared to enrage the enemies of the government\r\nby placing the national flag outside their head-quarters.  As soon as\r\nthe news of the capture of Camp Jackson reached the city the condition\r\nof affairs was changed.  Union men became rampant, aggressive, and, if\r\nyou will, intolerant.  They proclaimed their sentiments boldly, and were\r\nimpatient at anything like disrespect for the Union.  The secessionists\r\nbecame quiet but were filled with suppressed rage.  They had been\r\nplaying the bully.  The Union men ordered the rebel flag taken down from\r\nthe building on Pine Street.  The command was given in tones of\r\nauthority and it was taken down, never to be raised again in St. Louis.\r\n\r\nI witnessed the scene.  I had heard of the surrender of the camp and\r\nthat the garrison was on its way to the arsenal.  I had seen the troops\r\nstart out in the morning and had wished them success.  I now determined\r\nto go to the arsenal and await their arrival and congratulate them.  I\r\nstepped on a car standing at the corner of 4th and Pine streets, and saw\r\na crowd of people standing quietly in front of the head-quarters, who\r\nwere there for the purpose of hauling down the flag.  There were squads\r\nof other people at intervals down the street.  They too were quiet but\r\nfilled with suppressed rage, and muttered their resentment at the insult\r\nto, what they called, \"their\" flag.  Before the car I was in had\r\nstarted, a dapper little fellow--he would be called a dude at this day\r\n--stepped in.  He was in a great state of excitement and used adjectives\r\nfreely to express his contempt for the Union and for those who had just\r\nperpetrated such an outrage upon the rights of a free people.  There was\r\nonly one other passenger in the car besides myself when this young man\r\nentered.  He evidently expected to find nothing but sympathy when he got\r\naway from the \"mud sills\" engaged in compelling a \"free people\" to pull\r\ndown a flag they adored.  He turned to me saying:  \"Things have come to\r\na ---- pretty pass when a free people can't choose their own flag.\r\nWhere I came from if a man dares to say a word in favor of the Union we\r\nhang him to a limb of the first tree we come to.\"  I replied that \"after\r\nall we were not so intolerant in St. Louis as we might be; I had not\r\nseen a single rebel hung yet, nor heard of one; there were plenty of\r\nthem who ought to be, however.\"  The young man subsided.  He was so\r\ncrestfallen that I believe if I had ordered him to leave the car he\r\nwould have gone quietly out, saying to himself:  \"More Yankee\r\noppression.\"\r\n\r\nBy nightfall the late defenders of Camp Jackson were all within the\r\nwalls of the St. Louis arsenal, prisoners of war.  The next day I left\r\nSt. Louis for Mattoon, Illinois, where I was to muster in the regiment\r\nfrom that congressional district.  This was the 21st Illinois infantry,\r\nthe regiment of which I subsequently became colonel.  I mustered one\r\nregiment afterwards, when my services for the State were about closed.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General John Pope was stationed at Springfield, as United\r\nStates mustering officer, all the time I was in the State service.  He\r\nwas a native of Illinois and well acquainted with most of the prominent\r\nmen in the State.  I was a carpet-bagger and knew but few of them.\r\nWhile I was on duty at Springfield the senators, representatives in\r\nCongress, ax-governors and the State legislators were nearly all at the\r\nState capital.  The only acquaintance I made among them was with the\r\ngovernor, whom I was serving, and, by chance, with Senator S. A.\r\nDouglas.  The only members of Congress I knew were Washburne and Philip\r\nFoulk.  With the former, though he represented my district and we were\r\ncitizens of the same town, I only became acquainted at the meeting when\r\nthe first company of Galena volunteers was raised.  Foulk I had known in\r\nSt. Louis when I was a citizen of that city.  I had been three years at\r\nWest Point with Pope and had served with him a short time during the\r\nMexican war, under General Taylor.  I saw a good deal of him during my\r\nservice with the State.  On one occasion he said to me that I ought to\r\ngo into the United States service.  I told him I intended to do so if\r\nthere was a war.  He spoke of his acquaintance with the public men of\r\nthe State, and said he could get them to recommend me for a position and\r\nthat he would do all he could for me.  I declined to receive endorsement\r\nfor permission to fight for my country.\r\n\r\nGoing home for a day or two soon after this conversation with General\r\nPope, I wrote from Galena the following letter to the Adjutant-General\r\nof the Army.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALENA, ILLINOIS, May 24, 1861.\r\n\r\nCOL. L. THOMAS Adjt.  Gen.  U. S. A., Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Having served for fifteen years in the regular army, including\r\nfour years at West Point, and feeling it the duty of every one who has\r\nbeen educated at the Government expense to offer their services for the\r\nsupport of that Government, I have the honor, very respectfully, to\r\ntender my services, until the close of the war, in such capacity as may\r\nbe offered.  I would say, in view of my present age and length of\r\nservice, I feel myself competent to command a regiment, if the\r\nPresident, in his judgment, should see fit to intrust one to me.\r\n\r\nSince the first call of the President I have been serving on the staff\r\nof the Governor of this State, rendering such aid as I could in the\r\norganization of our State militia, and am still engaged in that\r\ncapacity.  A letter addressed to me at Springfield, Illinois, will reach\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI am very respectfully, Your obt. svt., U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter failed to elicit an answer from the Adjutant-General of the\r\nArmy.  I presume it was hardly read by him, and certainly it could not\r\nhave been submitted to higher authority. Subsequent to the war General\r\nBadeau having heard of this letter applied to the War Department for a\r\ncopy of it.  The letter could not be found and no one recollected ever\r\nhaving seen it.  I took no copy when it was written.  Long after the\r\napplication of General Badeau, General Townsend, who had become\r\nAdjutant-General of the Army, while packing up papers preparatory to the\r\nremoval of his office, found this letter in some out-of-the-way place.\r\nIt had not been destroyed, but it had not been regularly filed away.\r\n\r\nI felt some hesitation in suggesting rank as high as the colonelcy of a\r\nregiment, feeling somewhat doubtful whether I would be equal to the\r\nposition.  But I had seen nearly every colonel who had been mustered in\r\nfrom the State of Illinois, and some from Indiana, and felt that if they\r\ncould command a regiment properly, and with credit, I could also.\r\n\r\nHaving but little to do after the muster of the last of the regiments\r\nauthorized by the State legislature, I asked and obtained of the\r\ngovernor leave of absence for a week to visit my parents in Covington,\r\nKentucky, immediately opposite Cincinnati.  General McClellan had been\r\nmade a major-general and had his headquarters at Cincinnati.  In reality\r\nI wanted to see him.  I had known him slightly at West Point, where we\r\nserved one year together, and in the Mexican war.  I was in hopes that\r\nwhen he saw me he would offer me a position on his staff.  I called on\r\ntwo successive days at his office but failed to see him on either\r\noccasion, and returned to Springfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAPPOINTED COLONEL OF THE 21ST ILLINOIS--PERSONNEL OF THE REGIMENT\r\n--GENERAL LOGAN--MARCH TO MISSOURI--MOVEMENT AGAINST HARRIS AT FLORIDA,\r\nMO.--GENERAL POPE IN COMMAND--STATIONED AT MEXICO, MO.\r\n\r\nWhile I was absent from the State capital on this occasion the\r\nPresident's second call for troops was issued.  This time it was for\r\n300,000 men, for three years or the war.  This brought into the United\r\nStates service all the regiments then in the State service.  These had\r\nelected their officers from highest to lowest and were accepted with\r\ntheir organizations as they were, except in two instances.  A Chicago\r\nregiment, the 19th infantry, had elected a very young man to the\r\ncolonelcy.  When it came to taking the field the regiment asked to have\r\nanother appointed colonel and the one they had previously chosen made\r\nlieutenant-colonel.  The 21st regiment of infantry, mustered in by me at\r\nMattoon, refused to go into the service with the colonel of their\r\nselection in any position.  While I was still absent Governor Yates\r\nappointed me colonel of this latter regiment.  A few days after I was in\r\ncharge of it and in camp on the fair grounds near Springfield.\r\n\r\nMy regiment was composed in large part of young men of as good social\r\nposition as any in their section of the State.  It embraced the sons of\r\nfarmers, lawyers, physicians, politicians, merchants, bankers and\r\nministers, and some men of maturer years who had filled such positions\r\nthemselves.  There were also men in it who could be led astray; and the\r\ncolonel, elected by the votes of the regiment, had proved to be fully\r\ncapable of developing all there was in his men of recklessness.  It was\r\nsaid that he even went so far at times as to take the guard from their\r\nposts and go with them to the village near by and make a night of it.\r\nWhen there came a prospect of battle the regiment wanted to have some\r\none else to lead them.  I found it very hard work for a few days to\r\nbring all the men into anything like subordination; but the great\r\nmajority favored discipline, and by the application of a little regular\r\narmy punishment all were reduced to as good discipline as one could ask.\r\n\r\nThe ten regiments which had volunteered in the State service for thirty\r\ndays, it will be remembered, had done so with a pledge to go into the\r\nNational service if called upon within that time. When they volunteered\r\nthe government had only called for ninety days' enlistments.  Men were\r\ncalled now for three years or the war.  They felt that this change of\r\nperiod released them from the obligation of re-volunteering.  When I was\r\nappointed colonel, the 21st regiment was still in the State service.\r\nAbout the time they were to be mustered into the United States service,\r\nsuch of them as would go, two members of Congress from the State,\r\nMcClernand and Logan, appeared at the capital and I was introduced to\r\nthem.  I had never seen either of them before, but I had read a great\r\ndeal about them, and particularly about Logan, in the newspapers.  Both\r\nwere democratic members of Congress, and Logan had been elected from the\r\nsouthern district of the State, where he had a majority of eighteen\r\nthousand over his Republican competitor.  His district had been settled\r\noriginally by people from the Southern States, and at the breaking out\r\nof secession they sympathized with the South.  At the first outbreak of\r\nwar some of them joined the Southern army; many others were preparing to\r\ndo so; others rode over the country at night denouncing the Union, and\r\nmade it as necessary to guard railroad bridges over which National\r\ntroops had to pass in southern Illinois, as it was in Kentucky or any of\r\nthe border slave states.  Logan's popularity in this district was\r\nunbounded.  He knew almost enough of the people in it by their Christian\r\nnames, to form an ordinary congressional district.  As he went in\r\npolitics, so his district was sure to go.  The Republican papers had\r\nbeen demanding that he should announce where he stood on the questions\r\nwhich at that time engrossed the whole of public thought.  Some were\r\nvery bitter in their denunciations of his silence.  Logan was not a man\r\nto be coerced into an utterance by threats.  He did, however, come out\r\nin a speech before the adjournment of the special session of Congress\r\nwhich was convened by the President soon after his inauguration, and\r\nannounced his undying loyalty and devotion to the Union. But I had not\r\nhappened to see that speech, so that when I first met Logan my\r\nimpressions were those formed from reading denunciations of him.\r\nMcClernand, on the other hand, had early taken strong grounds for the\r\nmaintenance of the Union and had been praised accordingly by the\r\nRepublican papers.  The gentlemen who presented these two members of\r\nCongress asked me if I would have any objections to their addressing my\r\nregiment.  I hesitated a little before answering.  It was but a few days\r\nbefore the time set for mustering into the United States service such of\r\nthe men as were willing to volunteer for three years or the war.  I had\r\nsome doubt as to the effect a speech from Logan might have; but as he\r\nwas with McClernand, whose sentiments on the all-absorbing questions of\r\nthe day were well known, I gave my consent.  McClernand spoke first; and\r\nLogan followed in a speech which he has hardly equalled since for force\r\nand eloquence.  It breathed a loyalty and devotion to the Union which\r\ninspired my men to such a point that they would have volunteered to\r\nremain in the army as long as an enemy of the country continued to bear\r\narms against it.  They entered the United States service almost to a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nGeneral Logan went to his part of the State and gave his attention to\r\nraising troops.  The very men who at first made it necessary to guard\r\nthe roads in southern Illinois became the defenders of the Union.  Logan\r\nentered the service himself as colonel of a regiment and rapidly rose to\r\nthe rank of major-general.  His district, which had promised at first to\r\ngive much trouble to the government, filled every call made upon it for\r\ntroops, without resorting to the draft.  There was no call made when\r\nthere were not more volunteers than were asked for. That congressional\r\ndistrict stands credited at the War Department to-day with furnishing\r\nmore men for the army than it was called on to supply.\r\n\r\nI remained in Springfield with my regiment until the 3d of July, when I\r\nwas ordered to Quincy, Illinois.  By that time the regiment was in a\r\ngood state of discipline and the officers and men were well up in the\r\ncompany drill.  There was direct railroad communication between\r\nSpringfield and Quincy, but I thought it would be good preparation for\r\nthe troops to march there.  We had no transportation for our camp and\r\ngarrison equipage, so wagons were hired for the occasion and on the 3d\r\nof July we started.  There was no hurry, but fair marches were made\r\nevery day until the Illinois River was crossed.  There I was overtaken\r\nby a dispatch saying that the destination of the regiment had been\r\nchanged to Ironton, Missouri, and ordering me to halt where I was and\r\nawait the arrival of a steamer which had been dispatched up the Illinois\r\nRiver to take the regiment to St. Louis.  The boat, when it did come,\r\ngrounded on a sand-bar a few miles below where we were in camp.  We\r\nremained there several days waiting to have the boat get off the bar,\r\nbut before this occurred news came that an Illinois regiment was\r\nsurrounded by rebels at a point on the Hannibal and St. Joe Railroad\r\nsome miles west of Palmyra, in Missouri, and I was ordered to proceed\r\nwith all dispatch to their relief.  We took the cars and reached Quincy\r\nin a few hours.\r\n\r\nWhen I left Galena for the last time to take command of the 21st\r\nregiment I took with me my oldest son, Frederick D. Grant, then a lad of\r\neleven years of age.  On receiving the order to take rail for Quincy I\r\nwrote to Mrs. Grant, to relieve what I supposed would be her great\r\nanxiety for one so young going into danger, that I would send Fred home\r\nfrom Quincy by river.  I received a prompt letter in reply decidedly\r\ndisapproving my proposition, and urging that the lad should be allowed\r\nto accompany me.  It came too late.  Fred was already on his way up the\r\nMississippi bound for Dubuque, Iowa, from which place there was a\r\nrailroad to Galena.\r\n\r\nMy sensations as we approached what I supposed might be \"a field of\r\nbattle\" were anything but agreeable.  I had been in all the engagements\r\nin Mexico that it was possible for one person to be in; but not in\r\ncommand.  If some one else had been colonel and I had been\r\nlieutenant-colonel I do not think I would have felt any trepidation.\r\nBefore we were prepared to cross the Mississippi River at Quincy my\r\nanxiety was relieved; for the men of the besieged regiment came\r\nstraggling into town.  I am inclined to think both sides got frightened\r\nand ran away.\r\n\r\nI took my regiment to Palmyra and remained there for a few days, until\r\nrelieved by the 19th Illinois infantry.  From Palmyra I proceeded to\r\nSalt River, the railroad bridge over which had been destroyed by the\r\nenemy.  Colonel John M. Palmer at that time commanded the 13th Illinois,\r\nwhich was acting as a guard to workmen who were engaged in rebuilding\r\nthis bridge.  Palmer was my senior and commanded the two regiments as\r\nlong as we remained together.  The bridge was finished in about two\r\nweeks, and I received orders to move against Colonel Thomas Harris, who\r\nwas said to be encamped at the little town of Florida, some twenty-five\r\nmiles south of where we then were.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I now write we had no transportation and the\r\ncountry about Salt River was sparsely settled, so that it took some days\r\nto collect teams and drivers enough to move the camp and garrison\r\nequipage of a regiment nearly a thousand strong, together with a week's\r\nsupply of provision and some ammunition.  While preparations for the\r\nmove were going on I felt quite comfortable; but when we got on the road\r\nand found every house deserted I was anything but easy.  In the\r\ntwenty-five miles we had to march we did not see a person, old or young,\r\nmale or female, except two horsemen who were on a road that crossed\r\nours.  As soon as they saw us they decamped as fast as their horses\r\ncould carry them.  I kept my men in the ranks and forbade their entering\r\nany of the deserted houses or taking anything from them.  We halted at\r\nnight on the road and proceeded the next morning at an early hour.\r\nHarris had been encamped in a creek bottom for the sake of being near\r\nwater. The hills on either side of the creek extend to a considerable\r\nheight, possibly more than a hundred feet.  As we approached the brow of\r\nthe hill from which it was expected we could see Harris' camp, and\r\npossibly find his men ready formed to meet us, my heart kept getting\r\nhigher and higher until it felt to me as though it was in my throat.  I\r\nwould have given anything then to have been back in Illinois, but I had\r\nnot the moral courage to halt and consider what to do; I kept right on.\r\nWhen we reached a point from which the valley below was in full view I\r\nhalted. The place where Harris had been encamped a few days before was\r\nstill there and the marks of a recent encampment were plainly visible,\r\nbut the troops were gone.  My heart resumed its place.  It occurred to\r\nme at once that Harris had been as much afraid of me as I had been of\r\nhim. This was a view of the question I had never taken before; but it\r\nwas one I never forgot afterwards.  From that event to the close of the\r\nwar, I never experienced trepidation upon confronting an enemy, though I\r\nalways felt more or less anxiety.  I never forgot that he had as much\r\nreason to fear my forces as I had his.  The lesson was valuable.\r\n\r\nInquiries at the village of Florida divulged the fact that Colonel\r\nHarris, learning of my intended movement, while my transportation was\r\nbeing collected took time by the forelock and left Florida before I had\r\nstarted from Salt River.  He had increased the distance between us by\r\nforty miles.  The next day I started back to my old camp at Salt River\r\nbridge.  The citizens living on the line of our march had returned to\r\ntheir houses after we passed, and finding everything in good order,\r\nnothing carried away, they were at their front doors ready to greet us\r\nnow.  They had evidently been led to believe that the National troops\r\ncarried death and devastation with them wherever they went.\r\n\r\nIn a short time after our return to Salt River bridge I was ordered with\r\nmy regiment to the town of Mexico.  General Pope was then commanding the\r\ndistrict embracing all of the State of Missouri between the Mississippi\r\nand Missouri rivers, with his headquarters in the village of Mexico.  I\r\nwas assigned to the command of a sub-district embracing the troops in\r\nthe immediate neighborhood, some three regiments of infantry and a\r\nsection of artillery.  There was one regiment encamped by the side of\r\nmine.  I assumed command of the whole and the first night sent the\r\ncommander of the other regiment the parole and countersign.  Not wishing\r\nto be outdone in courtesy, he immediately sent me the countersign for\r\nhis regiment for the night.  When he was informed that the countersign\r\nsent to him was for use with his regiment as well as mine, it was\r\ndifficult to make him understand that this was not an unwarranted\r\ninterference of one colonel over another.  No doubt he attributed it for\r\nthe time to the presumption of a graduate of West Point over a volunteer\r\npure and simple.  But the question was soon settled and we had no\r\nfurther trouble.\r\n\r\nMy arrival in Mexico had been preceded by that of two or three regiments\r\nin which proper discipline had not been maintained, and the men had been\r\nin the habit of visiting houses without invitation and helping\r\nthemselves to food and drink, or demanding them from the occupants.\r\nThey carried their muskets while out of camp and made every man they\r\nfound take the oath of allegiance to the government.  I at once\r\npublished orders prohibiting the soldiers from going into private houses\r\nunless invited by the inhabitants, and from appropriating private\r\nproperty to their own or to government uses.  The people were no longer\r\nmolested or made afraid.  I received the most marked courtesy from the\r\ncitizens of Mexico as long as I remained there.\r\n\r\nUp to this time my regiment had not been carried in the school of the\r\nsoldier beyond the company drill, except that it had received some\r\ntraining on the march from Springfield to the Illinois River.  There was\r\nnow a good opportunity of exercising it in the battalion drill.  While I\r\nwas at West Point the tactics used in the army had been Scott's and the\r\nmusket the flint lock.  I had never looked at a copy of tactics from the\r\ntime of my graduation.  My standing in that branch of studies had been\r\nnear the foot of the class.  In the Mexican war in the summer of 1846, I\r\nhad been appointed regimental quartermaster and commissary and had not\r\nbeen at a battalion drill since.  The arms had been changed since then\r\nand Hardee's tactics had been adopted.  I got a copy of tactics and\r\nstudied one lesson, intending to confine the exercise of the first day\r\nto the commands I had thus learned.  By pursuing this course from day to\r\nday I thought I would soon get through the volume.\r\n\r\nWe were encamped just outside of town on the common, among scattering\r\nsuburban houses with enclosed gardens, and when I got my regiment in\r\nline and rode to the front I soon saw that if I attempted to follow the\r\nlesson I had studied I would have to clear away some of the houses and\r\ngarden fences to make room.  I perceived at once, however, that Hardee's\r\ntactics--a mere translation from the French with Hardee's name attached\r\n--was nothing more than common sense and the progress of the age applied\r\nto Scott's system.  The commands were abbreviated and the movement\r\nexpedited.  Under the old tactics almost every change in the order of\r\nmarch was preceded by a \"halt,\" then came the change, and then the\r\n\"forward march.\"  With the new tactics all these changes could be made\r\nwhile in motion.  I found no trouble in giving commands that would take\r\nmy regiment where I wanted it to go and carry it around all obstacles.\r\nI do not believe that the officers of the regiment ever discovered that\r\nI had never studied the tactics that I used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONED BRIGADIER-GENERAL--COMMAND AT IRONTON, MO.--JEFFERSON CITY\r\n--CAPE GIRARDEAU--GENERAL PRENTISS--SEIZURE OF PADUCAH--HEADQUARTERS AT\r\nCAIRO.\r\n\r\nI had not been in Mexico many weeks when, reading a St. Louis paper,\r\nI found the President had asked the Illinois delegation in Congress\r\nto recommend some citizens of the State for the position of\r\nbrigadier-general, and that they had unanimously recommended me as first\r\non a list of seven.  I was very much surprised because, as I have said,\r\nmy acquaintance with the Congressmen was very limited and I did not know\r\nof anything I had done to inspire such confidence.  The papers of the\r\nnext day announced that my name, with three others, had been sent to the\r\nSenate, and a few days after our confirmation was announced.\r\n\r\nWhen appointed brigadier-general I at once thought it proper that one of\r\nmy aides should come from the regiment I had been commanding, and so\r\nselected Lieutenant C. B. Lagow.  While living in St. Louis, I had had a\r\ndesk in the law office of McClellan, Moody and Hillyer.  Difference in\r\nviews between the members of the firm on the questions of the day, and\r\ngeneral hard times in the border cities, had broken up this firm.\r\nHillyer was quite a young man, then in his twenties, and very brilliant.\r\nI asked him to accept a place on my staff.  I also wanted to take one\r\nman from my new home, Galena.  The canvass in the Presidential campaign\r\nthe fall before had brought out a young lawyer by the name of John A.\r\nRawlins, who proved himself one of the ablest speakers in the State.  He\r\nwas also a candidate for elector on the Douglas ticket.  When Sumter was\r\nfired upon and the integrity of the Union threatened, there was no man\r\nmore ready to serve his country than he.  I wrote at once asking him to\r\naccept the position of assistant adjutant-general with the rank of\r\ncaptain, on my staff.  He was about entering the service as major of a\r\nnew regiment then organizing in the north-western part of the State; but\r\nhe threw this up and accepted my offer.\r\n\r\nNeither Hillyer nor Lagow proved to have any particular taste or special\r\nqualifications for the duties of the soldier, and the former resigned\r\nduring the Vicksburg campaign; the latter I relieved after the battle of\r\nChattanooga.  Rawlins remained with me as long as he lived, and rose to\r\nthe rank of brigadier general and chief-of-staff to the General of the\r\nArmy--an office created for him--before the war closed.  He was an able\r\nman, possessed of great firmness, and could say \"no\" so emphatically to\r\na request which he thought should not be granted that the person he was\r\naddressing would understand at once that there was no use of pressing\r\nthe matter.  General Rawlins was a very useful officer in other ways\r\nthan this.  I became very much attached to him.\r\n\r\nShortly after my promotion I was ordered to Ironton, Missouri, to\r\ncommand a district in that part of the State, and took the 21st\r\nIllinois, my old regiment, with me.  Several other regiments were\r\nordered to the same destination about the same time.  Ironton is on the\r\nIron Mountain railroad, about seventy miles south of St. Louis, and\r\nsituated among hills rising almost to the dignity of mountains.  When I\r\nreached there, about the 8th of August, Colonel B. Gratz Brown\r\n--afterwards Governor of Missouri and in 1872 Vice-Presidential candidate\r\n--was in command.  Some of his troops were ninety days' men and their\r\ntime had expired some time before.  The men had no clothing but what\r\nthey had volunteered in, and much of this was so worn that it would\r\nhardly stay on.  General Hardee--the author of the tactics I did not\r\nstudy--was at Greenville some twenty-five miles further south, it was\r\nsaid, with five thousand Confederate troops.  Under these circumstances\r\nColonel Brown's command was very much demoralized.  A squadron of\r\ncavalry could have ridden into the valley and captured the entire force.\r\nBrown himself was gladder to see me on that occasion than he ever has\r\nbeen since.  I relieved him and sent all his men home within a day or\r\ntwo, to be mustered out of service.\r\n\r\nWithin ten days after reaching Ironton I was prepared to take the\r\noffensive against the enemy at Greenville.  I sent a column east out of\r\nthe valley we were in, with orders to swing around to the south and west\r\nand come into the Greenville road ten miles south of Ironton.  Another\r\ncolumn marched on the direct road and went into camp at the point\r\ndesignated for the two columns to meet. I was to ride out the next\r\nmorning and take personal command of the movement.  My experience\r\nagainst Harris, in northern Missouri, had inspired me with confidence.\r\nBut when the evening train came in, it brought General B. M. Prentiss\r\nwith orders to take command of the district.  His orders did not relieve\r\nme, but I knew that by law I was senior, and at that time even the\r\nPresident did not have the authority to assign a junior to command a\r\nsenior of the same grade.  I therefore gave General Prentiss the\r\nsituation of the troops and the general condition of affairs, and\r\nstarted for St. Louis the same day.  The movement against the rebels at\r\nGreenville went no further.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Louis I was ordered to Jefferson City, the capital of the\r\nState, to take command.  General Sterling Price, of the Confederate\r\narmy, was thought to be threatening the capital, Lexington, Chillicothe\r\nand other comparatively large towns in the central part of Missouri.  I\r\nfound a good many troops in Jefferson City, but in the greatest\r\nconfusion, and no one person knew where they all were.  Colonel\r\nMulligan, a gallant man, was in command, but he had not been educated as\r\nyet to his new profession and did not know how to maintain discipline.\r\nI found that volunteers had obtained permission from the department\r\ncommander, or claimed they had, to raise, some of them, regiments; some\r\nbattalions; some companies--the officers to be commissioned according to\r\nthe number of men they brought into the service.  There were recruiting\r\nstations all over town, with notices, rudely lettered on boards over the\r\ndoors, announcing the arm of service and length of time for which\r\nrecruits at that station would be received.  The law required all\r\nvolunteers to serve for three years or the war.  But in Jefferson City\r\nin August, 1861, they were recruited for different periods and on\r\ndifferent conditions; some were enlisted for six months, some for a\r\nyear, some without any condition as to where they were to serve, others\r\nwere not to be sent out of the State.  The recruits were principally men\r\nfrom regiments stationed there and already in the service, bound for\r\nthree years if the war lasted that long.\r\n\r\nThe city was filled with Union fugitives who had been driven by guerilla\r\nbands to take refuge with the National troops.  They were in a\r\ndeplorable condition and must have starved but for the support the\r\ngovernment gave them.  They had generally made their escape with a team\r\nor two, sometimes a yoke of oxen with a mule or a horse in the lead.  A\r\nlittle bedding besides their clothing and some food had been thrown into\r\nthe wagon.  All else of their worldly goods were abandoned and\r\nappropriated by their former neighbors; for the Union man in Missouri\r\nwho staid at home during the rebellion, if he was not immediately under\r\nthe protection of the National troops, was at perpetual war with his\r\nneighbors.  I stopped the recruiting service, and disposed the troops\r\nabout the outskirts of the city so as to guard all approaches.  Order\r\nwas soon restored.\r\n\r\nI had been at Jefferson City but a few days when I was directed from\r\ndepartment headquarters to fit out an expedition to Lexington,\r\nBooneville and Chillicothe, in order to take from the banks in those\r\ncities all the funds they had and send them to St. Louis.  The western\r\narmy had not yet been supplied with transportation.  It became necessary\r\ntherefore to press into the service teams belonging to sympathizers with\r\nthe rebellion or to hire those of Union men.  This afforded an\r\nopportunity of giving employment to such of the refugees within our\r\nlines as had teams suitable for our purposes.  They accepted the service\r\nwith alacrity.  As fast as troops could be got off they were moved west\r\nsome twenty miles or more.  In seven or eight days from my assuming\r\ncommand at Jefferson City, I had all the troops, except a small\r\ngarrison, at an advanced position and expected to join them myself the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nBut my campaigns had not yet begun, for while seated at my office door,\r\nwith nothing further to do until it was time to start for the front, I\r\nsaw an officer of rank approaching, who proved to be Colonel Jefferson\r\nC. Davis.  I had never met him before, but he introduced himself by\r\nhanding me an order for him to proceed to Jefferson City and relieve me\r\nof the command.  The orders directed that I should report at department\r\nheadquarters at St. Louis without delay, to receive important special\r\ninstructions.  It was about an hour before the only regular train of the\r\nday would start.  I therefore turned over to Colonel Davis my orders,\r\nand hurriedly stated to him the progress that had been made to carry out\r\nthe department instructions already described.  I had at that time but\r\none staff officer, doing myself all the detail work usually performed by\r\nan adjutant-general.  In an hour after being relieved from the command I\r\nwas on my way to St. Louis, leaving my single staff officer(*6) to\r\nfollow the next day with our horses and baggage.\r\n\r\nThe \"important special instructions\" which I received the next day,\r\nassigned me to the command of the district of south-east Missouri,\r\nembracing all the territory south of St. Louis, in Missouri, as well as\r\nall southern Illinois.  At first I was to take personal command of a\r\ncombined expedition that had been ordered for the capture of Colonel\r\nJeff. Thompson, a sort of independent or partisan commander who was\r\ndisputing with us the possession of south-east Missouri.  Troops had\r\nbeen ordered to move from Ironton to Cape Girardeau, sixty or seventy\r\nmiles to the south-east, on the Mississippi River; while the forces at\r\nCape Girardeau had been ordered to move to Jacksonville, ten miles out\r\ntowards Ironton; and troops at Cairo and Bird's Point, at the junction\r\nof the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, were to hold themselves in readiness\r\nto go down the Mississippi to Belmont, eighteen miles below, to be moved\r\nwest from there when an officer should come to command them.  I was the\r\nofficer who had been selected for this purpose.  Cairo was to become my\r\nheadquarters when the expedition terminated.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of my orders I established my temporary headquarters at\r\nCape Girardeau and sent instructions to the commanding officer at\r\nJackson, to inform me of the approach of General Prentiss from Ironton.\r\nHired wagons were kept moving night and day to take additional rations\r\nto Jackson, to supply the troops when they started from there.  Neither\r\nGeneral Prentiss nor Colonel Marsh, who commanded at Jackson, knew their\r\ndestination.  I drew up all the instructions for the contemplated move,\r\nand kept them in my pocket until I should hear of the junction of our\r\ntroops at Jackson.  Two or three days after my arrival at Cape\r\nGirardeau, word came that General Prentiss was approaching that place\r\n(Jackson).  I started at once to meet him there and to give him his\r\norders.  As I turned the first corner of a street after starting, I saw\r\na column of cavalry passing the next street in front of me.  I turned\r\nand rode around the block the other way, so as to meet the head of the\r\ncolumn.  I found there General Prentiss himself, with a large escort.\r\nHe had halted his troops at Jackson for the night, and had come on\r\nhimself to Cape Girardeau, leaving orders for his command to follow him\r\nin the morning.  I gave the General his orders--which stopped him at\r\nJackson--but he was very much aggrieved at being placed under another\r\nbrigadier-general, particularly as he believed himself to be the senior.\r\nHe had been a brigadier, in command at Cairo, while I was mustering\r\nofficer at Springfield without any rank.  But we were nominated at the\r\nsame time for the United States service, and both our commissions bore\r\ndate May 17th, 1861.  By virtue of my former army rank I was, by law,\r\nthe senior.  General Prentiss failed to get orders to his troops to\r\nremain at Jackson, and the next morning early they were reported as\r\napproaching Cape Girardeau.  I then ordered the General very\r\nperemptorily to countermarch his command and take it back to Jackson.\r\nHe obeyed the order, but bade his command adieu when he got them to\r\nJackson, and went to St. Louis and reported himself.  This broke up the\r\nexpedition.  But little harm was done, as Jeff. Thompson moved light and\r\nhad no fixed place for even nominal headquarters.  He was as much at\r\nhome in Arkansas as he was in Missouri and would keep out of the way of\r\na superior force.  Prentiss was sent to another part of the State.\r\n\r\nGeneral Prentiss made a great mistake on the above occasion, one that he\r\nwould not have committed later in the war.  When I came to know him\r\nbetter, I regretted it much.  In consequence of this occurrence he was\r\noff duty in the field when the principal campaign at the West was going\r\non, and his juniors received promotion while he was where none could be\r\nobtained.  He would have been next to myself in rank in the district of\r\nsouth-east Missouri, by virtue of his services in the Mexican war.  He\r\nwas a brave and very earnest soldier.  No man in the service was more\r\nsincere in his devotion to the cause for which we were battling; none\r\nmore ready to make sacrifices or risk life in it.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of September I removed my headquarters to Cairo and found\r\nColonel Richard Oglesby in command of the post.  We had never met, at\r\nleast not to my knowledge.  After my promotion I had ordered my\r\nbrigadier-general's uniform from New York, but it had not yet arrived,\r\nso that I was in citizen's dress.  The Colonel had his office full of\r\npeople, mostly from the neighboring States of Missouri and Kentucky,\r\nmaking complaints or asking favors.  He evidently did not catch my name\r\nwhen I was presented, for on my taking a piece of paper from the table\r\nwhere he was seated and writing the order assuming command of the\r\ndistrict of south-east Missouri, Colonel Richard J. Oglesby to command\r\nthe post at Bird's Point, and handing it to him, he put on an expression\r\nof surprise that looked a little as if he would like to have some one\r\nidentify me.  But he surrendered the office without question.\r\n\r\nThe day after I assumed command at Cairo a man came to me who said he\r\nwas a scout of General Fremont.  He reported that he had just come from\r\nColumbus, a point on the Mississippi twenty miles below on the Kentucky\r\nside, and that troops had started from there, or were about to start, to\r\nseize Paducah, at the mouth of the Tennessee.  There was no time for\r\ndelay; I reported by telegraph to the department commander the\r\ninformation I had received, and added that I was taking steps to get off\r\nthat night to be in advance of the enemy in securing that important\r\npoint.  There was a large number of steamers lying at Cairo and a good\r\nmany boatmen were staying in the town.  It was the work of only a few\r\nhours to get the boats manned, with coal aboard and steam up.  Troops\r\nwere also designated to go aboard.  The distance from Cairo to Paducah\r\nis about forty-five miles.  I did not wish to get there before daylight\r\nof the 6th, and directed therefore that the boats should lie at anchor\r\nout in the stream until the time to start.  Not having received an\r\nanswer to my first dispatch, I again telegraphed to department\r\nheadquarters that I should start for Paducah that night unless I\r\nreceived further orders.  Hearing nothing, we started before midnight\r\nand arrived early the following morning, anticipating the enemy by\r\nprobably not over six or eight hours.  It proved very fortunate that the\r\nexpedition against Jeff. Thompson had been broken up. Had it not been,\r\nthe enemy would have seized Paducah and fortified it, to our very great\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\nWhen the National troops entered the town the citizens were taken by\r\nsurprise.  I never after saw such consternation depicted on the faces of\r\nthe people.  Men, women and children came out of their doors looking\r\npale and frightened at the presence of the invader.  They were expecting\r\nrebel troops that day.  In fact, nearly four thousand men from Columbus\r\nwere at that time within ten or fifteen miles of Paducah on their way to\r\noccupy the place.  I had but two regiments and one battery with me, but\r\nthe enemy did not know this and returned to Columbus.  I stationed my\r\ntroops at the best points to guard the roads leading into the city, left\r\ngunboats to guard the river fronts and by noon was ready to start on my\r\nreturn to Cairo.  Before leaving, however, I addressed a short printed\r\nproclamation to the citizens of Paducah assuring them of our peaceful\r\nintentions, that we had come among them to protect them against the\r\nenemies of our country, and that all who chose could continue their\r\nusual avocations with assurance of the protection of the government.\r\nThis was evidently a relief to them; but the majority would have much\r\npreferred the presence of the other army.  I reinforced Paducah rapidly\r\nfrom the troops at Cape Girardeau; and a day or two later General C. F.\r\nSmith, a most accomplished soldier, reported at Cairo and was assigned\r\nto the command of the post at the mouth of the Tennessee.  In a short\r\ntime it was well fortified and a detachment was sent to occupy\r\nSmithland, at the mouth of the Cumberland.\r\n\r\nThe State government of Kentucky at that time was rebel in sentiment,\r\nbut wanted to preserve an armed neutrality between the North and the\r\nSouth, and the governor really seemed to think the State had a perfect\r\nright to maintain a neutral position. The rebels already occupied two\r\ntowns in the State, Columbus and Hickman, on the Mississippi; and at the\r\nvery moment the National troops were entering Paducah from the Ohio\r\nfront, General Lloyd Tilghman--a Confederate--with his staff and a small\r\ndetachment of men, were getting out in the other direction, while, as I\r\nhave already said, nearly four thousand Confederate troops were on\r\nKentucky soil on their way to take possession of the town. But, in the\r\nestimation of the governor and of those who thought with him, this did\r\nnot justify the National authorities in invading the soil of Kentucky.\r\nI informed the legislature of the State of what I was doing, and my\r\naction was approved by the majority of that body.  On my return to Cairo\r\nI found authority from department headquarters for me to take Paducah\r\n\"if I felt strong enough,\" but very soon after I was reprimanded from\r\nthe same quarters for my correspondence with the legislature and warned\r\nagainst a repetition of the offence.\r\n\r\nSoon after I took command at Cairo, General Fremont entered into\r\narrangements for the exchange of the prisoners captured at Camp Jackson\r\nin the month of May.  I received orders to pass them through my lines to\r\nColumbus as they presented themselves with proper credentials.  Quite a\r\nnumber of these prisoners I had been personally acquainted with before\r\nthe war.  Such of them as I had so known were received at my\r\nheadquarters as old acquaintances, and ordinary routine business was not\r\ndisturbed by their presence.  On one occasion when several were present\r\nin my office my intention to visit Cape Girardeau the next day, to\r\ninspect the troops at that point, was mentioned.  Something transpired\r\nwhich postponed my trip; but a steamer employed by the government was\r\npassing a point some twenty or more miles above Cairo, the next day,\r\nwhen a section of rebel artillery with proper escort brought her to.  A\r\nmajor, one of those who had been at my headquarters the day before, came\r\nat once aboard and after some search made a direct demand for my\r\ndelivery.  It was hard to persuade him that I was not there.  This\r\nofficer was Major Barrett, of St. Louis.  I had been acquainted with his\r\nfamily before the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nGENERAL FREMONT IN COMMAND--MOVEMENT AGAINST BELMONT--BATTLE OF BELMONT\r\n--A NARROW ESCAPE--AFTER THE BATTLE.\r\n\r\nFrom the occupation of Paducah up to the early part of November nothing\r\nimportant occurred with the troops under my command.  I was reinforced\r\nfrom time to time and the men were drilled and disciplined preparatory\r\nfor the service which was sure to come.  By the 1st of November I had\r\nnot fewer than 20,000 men, most of them under good drill and ready to\r\nmeet any equal body of men who, like themselves, had not yet been in an\r\nengagement.  They were growing impatient at lying idle so long, almost\r\nin hearing of the guns of the enemy they had volunteered to fight\r\nagainst.  I asked on one or two occasions to be allowed to move against\r\nColumbus.  It could have been taken soon after the occupation of\r\nPaducah; but before November it was so strongly fortified that it would\r\nhave required a large force and a long siege to capture it.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of October General Fremont took the field in person\r\nand moved from Jefferson City against General Sterling Price, who was\r\nthen in the State of Missouri with a considerable command.  About the\r\nfirst of November I was directed from department headquarters to make a\r\ndemonstration on both sides of the Mississippi River with the view of\r\ndetaining the rebels at Columbus within their lines.  Before my troops\r\ncould be got off, I was notified from the same quarter that there were\r\nsome 3,000 of the enemy on the St. Francis River about fifty miles west,\r\nor south-west, from Cairo, and was ordered to send another force against\r\nthem.  I dispatched Colonel Oglesby at once with troops sufficient to\r\ncompete with the reported number of the enemy.  On the 5th word came\r\nfrom the same source that the rebels were about to detach a large force\r\nfrom Columbus to be moved by boats down the Mississippi and up the White\r\nRiver, in Arkansas, in order to reinforce Price, and I was directed to\r\nprevent this movement if possible.  I accordingly sent a regiment from\r\nBird's Point under Colonel W. H. L. Wallace to overtake and reinforce\r\nOglesby, with orders to march to New Madrid, a point some distance below\r\nColumbus, on the Missouri side.  At the same time I directed General C.\r\nF. Smith to move all the troops he could spare from Paducah directly\r\nagainst Columbus, halting them, however, a few miles from the town to\r\nawait further orders from me.  Then I gathered up all the troops at\r\nCairo and Fort Holt, except suitable guards, and moved them down the\r\nriver on steamers convoyed by two gunboats, accompanying them myself.\r\nMy force consisted of a little over 3,000 men and embraced five\r\nregiments of infantry, two guns and two companies of cavalry.  We\r\ndropped down the river on the 6th to within about six miles of Columbus,\r\ndebarked a few men on the Kentucky side and established pickets to\r\nconnect with the troops from Paducah.\r\n\r\nI had no orders which contemplated an attack by the National troops, nor\r\ndid I intend anything of the kind when I started out from Cairo; but\r\nafter we started I saw that the officers and men were elated at the\r\nprospect of at last having the opportunity of doing what they had\r\nvolunteered to do--fight the enemies of their country.  I did not see\r\nhow I could maintain discipline, or retain the confidence of my command,\r\nif we should return to Cairo without an effort to do something.\r\nColumbus, besides being strongly fortified, contained a garrison much\r\nmore numerous than the force I had with me.  It would not do, therefore,\r\nto attack that point.  About two o'clock on the morning of the 7th, I\r\nlearned that the enemy was crossing troops from Columbus to the west\r\nbank to be dispatched, presumably, after Oglesby.  I knew there was a\r\nsmall camp of Confederates at Belmont, immediately opposite Columbus,\r\nand I speedily resolved to push down the river, land on the Missouri\r\nside, capture Belmont, break up the camp and return.  Accordingly, the\r\npickets above Columbus were drawn in at once, and about daylight the\r\nboats moved out from shore.  In an hour we were debarking on the west\r\nbank of the Mississippi, just out of range of the batteries at Columbus.\r\n\r\nThe ground on the west shore of the river, opposite Columbus, is low and\r\nin places marshy and cut up with sloughs.  The soil is rich and the\r\ntimber large and heavy.  There were some small clearings between Belmont\r\nand the point where we landed, but most of the country was covered with\r\nthe native forests.  We landed in front of a cornfield.  When the\r\ndebarkation commenced, I took a regiment down the river to post it as a\r\nguard against surprise.  At that time I had no staff officer who could\r\nbe trusted with that duty.  In the woods, at a short distance below the\r\nclearing, I found a depression, dry at the time, but which at high water\r\nbecame a slough or bayou.  I placed the men in the hollow, gave them\r\ntheir instructions and ordered them to remain there until they were\r\nproperly relieved.  These troops, with the gunboats, were to protect our\r\ntransports.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the enemy had evidently failed to divine our intentions.\r\nFrom Columbus they could, of course, see our gunboats and transports\r\nloaded with troops.  But the force from Paducah was threatening them\r\nfrom the land side, and it was hardly to be expected that if Columbus\r\nwas our object we would separate our troops by a wide river.  They\r\ndoubtless thought we meant to draw a large force from the east bank,\r\nthen embark ourselves, land on the east bank and make a sudden assault\r\non Columbus before their divided command could be united.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o'clock we started from the point of debarkation, marching\r\nby the flank.  After moving in this way for a mile or a mile and a half,\r\nI halted where there was marshy ground covered with a heavy growth of\r\ntimber in our front, and deployed a large part of my force as\r\nskirmishers.  By this time the enemy discovered that we were moving upon\r\nBelmont and sent out troops to meet us.  Soon after we had started in\r\nline, his skirmishers were encountered and fighting commenced.  This\r\ncontinued, growing fiercer and fiercer, for about four hours, the enemy\r\nbeing forced back gradually until he was driven into his camp. Early in\r\nthis engagement my horse was shot under me, but I got another from one\r\nof my staff and kept well up with the advance until the river was\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nThe officers and men engaged at Belmont were then under fire for the\r\nfirst time.  Veterans could not have behaved better than they did up to\r\nthe moment of reaching the rebel camp.  At this point they became\r\ndemoralized from their victory and failed to reap its full reward.  The\r\nenemy had been followed so closely that when he reached the clear ground\r\non which his camp was pitched he beat a hasty retreat over the river\r\nbank, which protected him from our shots and from view.  This\r\nprecipitate retreat at the last moment enabled the National forces to\r\npick their way without hinderance through the _abatis_--the only\r\nartificial defence the enemy had.  The moment the camp was reached our\r\nmen laid down their arms and commenced rummaging the tents to pick up\r\ntrophies.  Some of the higher officers were little better than the\r\nprivates.  They galloped about from one cluster of men to another and at\r\nevery halt delivered a short eulogy upon the Union cause and the\r\nachievements of the command.\r\n\r\nAll this time the troops we had been engaged with for four hours, lay\r\ncrouched under cover of the river bank, ready to come up and surrender\r\nif summoned to do so; but finding that they were not pursued, they\r\nworked their way up the river and came up on the bank between us and our\r\ntransports.  I saw at the same time two steamers coming from the\r\nColumbus side towards the west shore, above us, black--or gray--with\r\nsoldiers from boiler-deck to roof.  Some of my men were engaged in\r\nfiring from captured guns at empty steamers down the river, out of\r\nrange, cheering at every shot.  I tried to get them to turn their guns\r\nupon the loaded steamers above and not so far away.  My efforts were in\r\nvain.  At last I directed my staff officers to set fire to the camps.\r\nThis drew the fire of the enemy's guns located on the heights of\r\nColumbus.  They had abstained from firing before, probably because they\r\nwere afraid of hitting their own men; or they may have supposed, until\r\nthe camp was on fire, that it was still in the possession of their\r\nfriends.  About this time, too, the men we had driven over the bank were\r\nseen in line up the river between us and our transports.  The alarm\r\n\"surrounded\" was given.  The guns of the enemy and the report of being\r\nsurrounded, brought officers and men completely under control.  At first\r\nsome of the officers seemed to think that to be surrounded was to be\r\nplaced in a hopeless position, where there was nothing to do but\r\nsurrender.  But when I announced that we had cut our way in and could\r\ncut our way out just as well, it seemed a new revelation to officers and\r\nsoldiers.  They formed line rapidly and we started back to our boats,\r\nwith the men deployed as skirmishers as they had been on entering camp.\r\nThe enemy was soon encountered, but his resistance this time was feeble.\r\nAgain the Confederates sought shelter under the river banks.  We could\r\nnot stop, however, to pick them up, because the troops we had seen\r\ncrossing the river had debarked by this time and were nearer our\r\ntransports than we were.  It would be prudent to get them behind us; but\r\nwe were not again molested on our way to the boats.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the fighting our wounded had been carried to the\r\nhouses at the rear, near the place of debarkation.  I now set the troops\r\nto bringing their wounded to the boats.  After this had gone on for some\r\nlittle time I rode down the road, without even a staff officer, to visit\r\nthe guard I had stationed over the approach to our transports.  I knew\r\nthe enemy had crossed over from Columbus in considerable numbers and\r\nmight be expected to attack us as we were embarking.  This guard would\r\nbe encountered first and, as they were in a natural intrenchment, would\r\nbe able to hold the enemy for a considerable time.  My surprise was\r\ngreat to find there was not a single man in the trench.  Riding back to\r\nthe boat I found the officer who had commanded the guard and learned\r\nthat he had withdrawn his force when the main body fell back.  At first\r\nI ordered the guard to return, but finding that it would take some time\r\nto get the men together and march them back to their position, I\r\ncountermanded the order.  Then fearing that the enemy we had seen\r\ncrossing the river below might be coming upon us unawares, I rode out in\r\nthe field to our front, still entirely alone, to observe whether the\r\nenemy was passing.  The field was grown up with corn so tall and thick\r\nas to cut off the view of even a person on horseback, except directly\r\nalong the rows.  Even in that direction, owing to the overhanging blades\r\nof corn, the view was not extensive. I had not gone more than a few\r\nhundred yards when I saw a body of troops marching past me not fifty\r\nyards away.  I looked at them for a moment and then turned my horse\r\ntowards the river and started back, first in a walk, and when I thought\r\nmyself concealed from the view of the enemy, as fast as my horse could\r\ncarry me.  When at the river bank I still had to ride a few hundred\r\nyards to the point where the nearest transport lay.\r\n\r\nThe cornfield in front of our transports terminated at the edge of a\r\ndense forest.  Before I got back the enemy had entered this forest and\r\nhad opened a brisk fire upon the boats.  Our men, with the exception of\r\ndetails that had gone to the front after the wounded, were now either\r\naboard the transports or very near them.  Those who were not aboard soon\r\ngot there, and the boats pushed off.  I was the only man of the National\r\narmy between the rebels and our transports.  The captain of a boat that\r\nhad just pushed out but had not started, recognized me and ordered the\r\nengineer not to start the engine; he then had a plank run out for me.\r\nMy horse seemed to take in the situation.  There was no path down the\r\nbank and every one acquainted with the Mississippi River knows that its\r\nbanks, in a natural state, do not vary at any great angle from the\r\nperpendicular.  My horse put his fore feet over the bank without\r\nhesitation or urging, and with his hind feet well under him, slid down\r\nthe bank and trotted aboard the boat, twelve or fifteen feet away, over\r\na single gang plank.  I dismounted and went at once to the upper deck.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi River was low on the 7th of November, 1861, so that the\r\nbanks were higher than the heads of men standing on the upper decks of\r\nthe steamers.  The rebels were some distance back from the river, so\r\nthat their fire was high and did us but little harm.  Our smoke-stack\r\nwas riddled with bullets, but there were only three men wounded on the\r\nboats, two of whom were soldiers.  When I first went on deck I entered\r\nthe captain's room adjoining the pilot-house, and threw myself on a\r\nsofa.  I did not keep that position a moment, but rose to go out on the\r\ndeck to observe what was going on.  I had scarcely left when a musket\r\nball entered the room, struck the head of the sofa, passed through it\r\nand lodged in the foot.\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy opened fire on the transports our gunboats returned it\r\nwith vigor.  They were well out in the stream and some distance down, so\r\nthat they had to give but very little elevation to their guns to clear\r\nthe banks of the river.  Their position very nearly enfiladed the line\r\nof the enemy while he was marching through the cornfield.  The execution\r\nwas very great, as we could see at the time and as I afterwards learned\r\nmore positively.  We were very soon out of range and went peacefully on\r\nour way to Cairo, every man feeling that Belmont was a great victory and\r\nthat he had contributed his share to it.\r\n\r\nOur loss at Belmont was 485 in killed, wounded and missing. About 125 of\r\nour wounded fell into the hands of the enemy.  We returned with 175\r\nprisoners and two guns, and spiked four other pieces.  The loss of the\r\nenemy, as officially reported, was 642 men, killed, wounded and missing.\r\nWe had engaged about 2,500 men, exclusive of the guard left with the\r\ntransports.  The enemy had about 7,000; but this includes the troops\r\nbrought over from Columbus who were not engaged in the first defence of\r\nBelmont.\r\n\r\nThe two objects for which the battle of Belmont was fought were fully\r\naccomplished.  The enemy gave up all idea of detaching troops from\r\nColumbus.  His losses were very heavy for that period of the war.\r\nColumbus was beset by people looking for their wounded or dead kin, to\r\ntake them home for medical treatment or burial.  I learned later, when I\r\nhad moved further south, that Belmont had caused more mourning than\r\nalmost any other battle up to that time.  The National troops acquired a\r\nconfidence in themselves at Belmont that did not desert them through the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe day after the battle I met some officers from General Polk's\r\ncommand, arranged for permission to bury our dead at Belmont and also\r\ncommenced negotiations for the exchange of prisoners.  When our men went\r\nto bury their dead, before they were allowed to land they were conducted\r\nbelow the point where the enemy had engaged our transports.  Some of the\r\nofficers expressed a desire to see the field; but the request was\r\nrefused with the statement that we had no dead there.\r\n\r\nWhile on the truce-boat I mentioned to an officer, whom I had known both\r\nat West Point and in the Mexican war, that I was in the cornfield near\r\ntheir troops when they passed; that I had been on horseback and had worn\r\na soldier's overcoat at the time.  This officer was on General Polk's\r\nstaff.  He said both he and the general had seen me and that Polk had\r\nsaid to his men, \"There is a Yankee; you may try your marksmanship on\r\nhim if you wish,\" but nobody fired at me.\r\n\r\nBelmont was severely criticised in the North as a wholly unnecessary\r\nbattle, barren of results, or the possibility of them from the\r\nbeginning.  If it had not been fought, Colonel Oglesby would probably\r\nhave been captured or destroyed with his three thousand men.  Then I\r\nshould have been culpable indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HALLECK IN COMMAND--COMMANDING THE DISTRICT OF CAIRO--MOVEMENT\r\nON FORT HENRY--CAPTURE OF FORT HENRY.\r\n\r\nWhile at Cairo I had frequent opportunities of meeting the rebel\r\nofficers of the Columbus garrison.  They seemed to be very fond of\r\ncoming up on steamers under flags of truce.  On two or three occasions I\r\nwent down in like manner.  When one of their boats was seen coming up\r\ncarrying a white flag, a gun would be fired from the lower battery at\r\nFort Holt, throwing a shot across the bow as a signal to come no\r\nfarther.  I would then take a steamer and, with my staff and\r\noccasionally a few other officers, go down to receive the party.  There\r\nwere several officers among them whom I had known before, both at West\r\nPoint and in Mexico. Seeing these officers who had been educated for the\r\nprofession of arms, both at school and in actual war, which is a far\r\nmore efficient training, impressed me with the great advantage the South\r\npossessed over the North at the beginning of the rebellion.  They had\r\nfrom thirty to forty per cent. of the educated soldiers of the Nation.\r\nThey had no standing army and, consequently, these trained soldiers had\r\nto find employment with the troops from their own States.  In this way\r\nwhat there was of military education and training was distributed\r\nthroughout their whole army.  The whole loaf was leavened.\r\n\r\nThe North had a great number of educated and trained soldiers, but the\r\nbulk of them were still in the army and were retained, generally with\r\ntheir old commands and rank, until the war had lasted many months.  In\r\nthe Army of the Potomac there was what was known as the \"regular\r\nbrigade,\" in which, from the commanding officer down to the youngest\r\nsecond lieutenant, every one was educated to his profession.  So, too,\r\nwith many of the batteries; all the officers, generally four in number\r\nto each, were men educated for their profession.  Some of these went\r\ninto battle at the beginning under division commanders who were entirely\r\nwithout military training.  This state of affairs gave me an idea which\r\nI expressed while at Cairo; that the government ought to disband the\r\nregular army, with the exception of the staff corps, and notify the\r\ndisbanded officers that they would receive no compensation while the war\r\nlasted except as volunteers.  The register should be kept up, but the\r\nnames of all officers who were not in the volunteer service at the\r\nclose, should be stricken from it.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of November, two days after the battle of Belmont,\r\nMajor-General H. W. Halleck superseded General Fremont in command of the\r\nDepartment of the Missouri.  The limits of his command took in Arkansas\r\nand west Kentucky east to the Cumberland River.  From the battle of\r\nBelmont until early in February, 1862, the troops under my command did\r\nlittle except prepare for the long struggle which proved to be before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe enemy at this time occupied a line running from the Mississippi\r\nRiver at Columbus to Bowling Green and Mill Springs, Kentucky.  Each of\r\nthese positions was strongly fortified, as were also points on the\r\nTennessee and Cumberland rivers near the Tennessee state line.  The\r\nworks on the Tennessee were called Fort Heiman and Fort Henry, and that\r\non the Cumberland was Fort Donelson.  At these points the two rivers\r\napproached within eleven miles of each other.  The lines of rifle pits\r\nat each place extended back from the water at least two miles, so that\r\nthe garrisons were in reality only seven miles apart.  These positions\r\nwere of immense importance to the enemy; and of course correspondingly\r\nimportant for us to possess ourselves of.  With Fort Henry in our hands\r\nwe had a navigable stream open to us up to Muscle Shoals, in Alabama.\r\nThe Memphis and Charleston Railroad strikes the Tennessee at Eastport,\r\nMississippi, and follows close to the banks of the river up to the\r\nshoals.  This road, of vast importance to the enemy, would cease to be\r\nof use to them for through traffic the moment Fort Henry became ours.\r\nFort Donelson was the gate to Nashville--a place of great military and\r\npolitical importance--and to a rich country extending far east in\r\nKentucky.  These two points in our possession the enemy would\r\nnecessarily be thrown back to the Memphis and Charleston road, or to the\r\nboundary of the cotton states, and, as before stated, that road would be\r\nlost to them for through communication.\r\n\r\nThe designation of my command had been changed after Halleck's arrival,\r\nfrom the District of South-east Missouri to the District of Cairo, and\r\nthe small district commanded by General C. F. Smith, embracing the\r\nmouths of the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, had been added to my\r\njurisdiction.  Early in January, 1862, I was directed by General\r\nMcClellan, through my department commander, to make a reconnoissance in\r\nfavor of Brigadier-General Don Carlos Buell, who commanded the\r\nDepartment of the Ohio, with headquarters at Louisville, and who was\r\nconfronting General S. B. Buckner with a larger Confederate force at\r\nBowling Green.  It was supposed that Buell was about to make some move\r\nagainst the enemy, and my demonstration was intended to prevent the\r\nsending of troops from Columbus, Fort Henry or Donelson to Buckner.  I\r\nat once ordered General Smith to send a force up the west bank of the\r\nTennessee to threaten forts Heiman and Henry; McClernand at the same\r\ntime with a force of 6,000 men was sent out into west Kentucky,\r\nthreatening Columbus with one column and the Tennessee River with\r\nanother. I went with McClernand's command.  The weather was very bad;\r\nsnow and rain fell; the roads, never good in that section, were\r\nintolerable.  We were out more than a week splashing through the mud,\r\nsnow and rain, the men suffering very much.  The object of the\r\nexpedition was accomplished.  The enemy did not send reinforcements to\r\nBowling Green, and General George H. Thomas fought and won the battle of\r\nMill Springs before we returned.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this expedition General Smith reported that he thought it\r\npracticable to capture Fort Heiman.  This fort stood on high ground,\r\ncompletely commanding Fort Henry on the opposite side of the river, and\r\nits possession by us, with the aid of our gunboats, would insure the\r\ncapture of Fort Henry.  This report of Smith's confirmed views I had\r\npreviously held, that the true line of operations for us was up the\r\nTennessee and Cumberland rivers.  With us there, the enemy would be\r\ncompelled to fall back on the east and west entirely out of the State of\r\nKentucky.  On the 6th of January, before receiving orders for this\r\nexpedition, I had asked permission of the general commanding the\r\ndepartment to go to see him at St. Louis.  My object was to lay this\r\nplan of campaign before him.  Now that my views had been confirmed by so\r\nable a general as Smith, I renewed my request to go to St. Louis on what\r\nI deemed important military business.  The leave was granted, but not\r\ngraciously.  I had known General Halleck but very slightly in the old\r\narmy, not having met him either at West Point or during the Mexican war.\r\nI was received with so little cordiality that I perhaps stated the\r\nobject of my visit with less clearness than I might have done, and I had\r\nnot uttered many sentences before I was cut short as if my plan was\r\npreposterous.  I returned to Cairo very much crestfallen.\r\n\r\nFlag-officer Foote commanded the little fleet of gunboats then in the\r\nneighborhood of Cairo and, though in another branch of the service, was\r\nsubject to the command of General Halleck.  He and I consulted freely\r\nupon military matters and he agreed with me perfectly as to the\r\nfeasibility of the campaign up the Tennessee.  Notwithstanding the\r\nrebuff I had received from my immediate chief, I therefore, on the 28th\r\nof January, renewed the suggestion by telegraph that \"if permitted, I\r\ncould take and hold Fort Henry on the Tennessee.\"  This time I was\r\nbacked by Flag-officer Foote, who sent a similar dispatch.  On the 29th\r\nI wrote fully in support of the proposition.  On the 1st of February I\r\nreceived full instructions from department headquarters to move upon\r\nFort Henry.  On the 2d the expedition started.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1862, there were quite a good many steamers laid up at\r\nCairo for want of employment, the Mississippi River being closed against\r\nnavigation below that point.  There were also many men in the town whose\r\noccupation had been following the river in various capacities, from\r\ncaptain down to deck hand But there were not enough of either boats or\r\nmen to move at one time the 17,000 men I proposed to take with me up the\r\nTennessee.  I loaded the boats with more than half the force, however,\r\nand sent General McClernand in command.  I followed with one of the\r\nlater boats and found McClernand had stopped, very properly, nine miles\r\nbelow Fort Henry.  Seven gunboats under Flag-officer Foote had\r\naccompanied the advance.  The transports we had with us had to return to\r\nPaducah to bring up a division from there, with General C. F. Smith in\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nBefore sending the boats back I wanted to get the troops as near to the\r\nenemy as I could without coming within range of their guns.  There was a\r\nstream emptying into the Tennessee on the east side, apparently at about\r\nlong range distance below the fort.  On account of the narrow water-shed\r\nseparating the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers at that point, the stream\r\nmust be insignificant at ordinary stages, but when we were there, in\r\nFebruary, it was a torrent.  It would facilitate the investment of Fort\r\nHenry materially if the troops could be landed south of that stream.  To\r\ntest whether this could be done I boarded the gunboat Essex and\r\nrequested Captain Wm. Porter commanding it, to approach the fort to draw\r\nits fire.  After we had gone some distance past the mouth of the stream\r\nwe drew the fire of the fort, which fell much short of us.  In\r\nconsequence I had made up my mind to return and bring the troops to the\r\nupper side of the creek, when the enemy opened upon us with a rifled gun\r\nthat sent shot far beyond us and beyond the stream.  One shot passed\r\nvery near where Captain Porter and I were standing, struck the deck near\r\nthe stern, penetrated and passed through the cabin and so out into the\r\nriver.  We immediately turned back, and the troops were debarked below\r\nthe mouth of the creek.\r\n\r\nWhen the landing was completed I returned with the transports to Paducah\r\nto hasten up the balance of the troops.  I got back on the 5th with the\r\nadvance, the remainder following as rapidly as the steamers could carry\r\nthem.  At ten o'clock at night, on the 5th, the whole command was not\r\nyet up.  Being anxious to commence operations as soon as possible before\r\nthe enemy could reinforce heavily, I issued my orders for an advance at\r\n11 A.M. on the 6th.  I felt sure that all the troops would be up by that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nFort Henry occupies a bend in the river which gave the guns in the water\r\nbattery a direct fire down the stream.  The camp outside the fort was\r\nintrenched, with rifle pits and outworks two miles back on the road to\r\nDonelson and Dover.  The garrison of the fort and camp was about 2,800,\r\nwith strong reinforcements from Donelson halted some miles out.  There\r\nwere seventeen heavy guns in the fort.  The river was very high, the\r\nbanks being overflowed except where the bluffs come to the water's edge.\r\nA portion of the ground on which Fort Henry stood was two feet deep in\r\nwater.  Below, the water extended into the woods several hundred yards\r\nback from the bank on the east side.  On the west bank Fort Heiman stood\r\non high ground, completely commanding Fort Henry.  The distance from\r\nFort Henry to Donelson is but eleven miles.  The two positions were so\r\nimportant to the enemy, AS HE SAW HIS INTEREST, that it was natural to\r\nsuppose that reinforcements would come from every quarter from which\r\nthey could be got.  Prompt action on our part was imperative.\r\n\r\nThe plan was for the troops and gunboats to start at the same moment.\r\nThe troops were to invest the garrison and the gunboats to attack the\r\nfort at close quarters.  General Smith was to land a brigade of his\r\ndivision on the west bank during the night of the 5th and get it in rear\r\nof Heiman.\r\n\r\nAt the hour designated the troops and gunboats started.  General Smith\r\nfound Fort Heiman had been evacuated before his men arrived.  The\r\ngunboats soon engaged the water batteries at very close quarters, but\r\nthe troops which were to invest Fort Henry were delayed for want of\r\nroads, as well as by the dense forest and the high water in what would\r\nin dry weather have been unimportant beds of streams.  This delay made\r\nno difference in the result.  On our first appearance Tilghman had sent\r\nhis entire command, with the exception of about one hundred men left to\r\nman the guns in the fort, to the outworks on the road to Dover and\r\nDonelson, so as to have them out of range of the guns of our navy; and\r\nbefore any attack on the 6th he had ordered them to retreat on Donelson.\r\nHe stated in his subsequent report that the defence was intended solely\r\nto give his troops time to make their escape.\r\n\r\nTilghman was captured with his staff and ninety men, as well as the\r\narmament of the fort, the ammunition and whatever stores were there.\r\nOur cavalry pursued the retreating column towards Donelson and picked up\r\ntwo guns and a few stragglers; but the enemy had so much the start, that\r\nthe pursuing force did not get in sight of any except the stragglers.\r\n\r\nAll the gunboats engaged were hit many times.  The damage, however,\r\nbeyond what could be repaired by a small expenditure of money, was\r\nslight, except to the Essex.  A shell penetrated the boiler of that\r\nvessel and exploded it, killing and wounding forty-eight men, nineteen\r\nof whom were soldiers who had been detailed to act with the navy.  On\r\nseveral occasions during the war such details were made when the\r\ncomplement of men with the navy was insufficient for the duty before\r\nthem.  After the fall of Fort Henry Captain Phelps, commanding the\r\niron-clad Carondelet, at my request ascended the Tennessee River and\r\nthoroughly destroyed the bridge of the Memphis and Ohio Railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nINVESTMENT OF FORT DONELSON--THE NAVAL OPERATIONS--ATTACK OF THE ENEMY\r\n--ASSAULTING THE WORKS--SURRENDER OF THE FORT.\r\n\r\nI informed the department commander of our success at Fort Henry and\r\nthat on the 8th I would take Fort Donelson.  But the rain continued to\r\nfall so heavily that the roads became impassable for artillery and wagon\r\ntrains.  Then, too, it would not have been prudent to proceed without\r\nthe gunboats.  At least it would have been leaving behind a valuable\r\npart of our available force.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, the day after the fall of Fort Henry, I took my staff and\r\nthe cavalry--a part of one regiment--and made a reconnoissance to within\r\nabout a mile of the outer line of works at Donelson.  I had known\r\nGeneral Pillow in Mexico, and judged that with any force, no matter how\r\nsmall, I could march up to within gunshot of any intrenchments he was\r\ngiven to hold.  I said this to the officers of my staff at the time.  I\r\nknew that Floyd was in command, but he was no soldier, and I judged that\r\nhe would yield to Pillow's pretensions.  I met, as I expected, no\r\nopposition in making the reconnoissance and, besides learning the\r\ntopography of the country on the way and around Fort Donelson, found\r\nthat there were two roads available for marching; one leading to the\r\nvillage of Dover, the other to Donelson.\r\n\r\nFort Donelson is two miles north, or down the river, from Dover.  The\r\nfort, as it stood in 1861, embraced about one hundred acres of land.  On\r\nthe east it fronted the Cumberland; to the north it faced Hickman's\r\ncreek, a small stream which at that time was deep and wide because of\r\nthe back-water from the river; on the south was another small stream, or\r\nrather a ravine, opening into the Cumberland.  This also was filled with\r\nback-water from the river.  The fort stood on high ground, some of it as\r\nmuch as a hundred feet above the Cumberland.  Strong protection to the\r\nheavy guns in the water batteries had been obtained by cutting away\r\nplaces for them in the bluff.  To the west there was a line of rifle\r\npits some two miles back from the river at the farthest point.  This\r\nline ran generally along the crest of high ground, but in one place\r\ncrossed a ravine which opens into the river between the village and the\r\nfort.  The ground inside and outside of this intrenched line was very\r\nbroken and generally wooded.  The trees outside of the rifle-pits had\r\nbeen cut down for a considerable way out, and had been felled so that\r\ntheir tops lay outwards from the intrenchments.  The limbs had been\r\ntrimmed and pointed, and thus formed an _abatis_ in front of the greater\r\npart of the line. Outside of this intrenched line, and extending about\r\nhalf the entire length of it, is a ravine running north and south and\r\nopening into Hickman creek at a point north of the fort.  The entire\r\nside of this ravine next to the works was one long _abatis_.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck commenced his efforts in all quarters to get\r\nreinforcements to forward to me immediately on my departure from Cairo.\r\nGeneral Hunter sent men freely from Kansas, and a large division under\r\nGeneral Nelson, from Buell's army, was also dispatched.  Orders went out\r\nfrom the War Department to consolidate fragments of companies that were\r\nbeing recruited in the Western States so as to make full companies, and\r\nto consolidate companies into regiments.  General Halleck did not\r\napprove or disapprove of my going to Fort Donelson.  He said nothing\r\nwhatever to me on the subject.  He informed Buell on the 7th that I\r\nwould march against Fort Donelson the next day; but on the 10th he\r\ndirected me to fortify Fort Henry strongly, particularly to the land\r\nside, saying that he forwarded me intrenching tools for that purpose.  I\r\nreceived this dispatch in front of Fort Donelson.\r\n\r\nI was very impatient to get to Fort Donelson because I knew the\r\nimportance of the place to the enemy and supposed he would reinforce it\r\nrapidly.  I felt that 15,000 men on the 8th would be more effective than\r\n50,000 a month later.  I asked Flag-officer Foote, therefore, to order\r\nhis gunboats still about Cairo to proceed up the Cumberland River and\r\nnot to wait for those gone to Eastport and  Florence; but the others got\r\nback in time and we started on the 12th.  I had moved McClernand out a\r\nfew miles the night before so as to leave the road as free as possible.\r\n\r\nJust as we were about to start the first reinforcement reached me on\r\ntransports.  It was a brigade composed of six full regiments commanded\r\nby Colonel Thayer, of Nebraska.  As the gunboats were going around to\r\nDonelson by the Tennessee, Ohio and Cumberland rivers, I directed Thayer\r\nto turn about and go under their convoy.\r\n\r\nI started from Fort Henry with 15,000 men, including eight batteries and\r\npart of a regiment of cavalry, and, meeting with no obstruction to\r\ndetain us, the advance arrived in front of the enemy by noon.  That\r\nafternoon and the next day were spent in taking up ground to make the\r\ninvestment as complete as possible.  General Smith had been directed to\r\nleave a portion of his division behind to guard forts Henry and Heiman.\r\nHe left General Lew. Wallace with 2,500 men.  With the remainder of his\r\ndivision he occupied our left, extending to Hickman creek. McClernand\r\nwas on the right and covered the roads running south and south-west from\r\nDover.  His right extended to the back-water up the ravine opening into\r\nthe Cumberland south of the village. The troops were not intrenched, but\r\nthe nature of the ground was such that they were just as well protected\r\nfrom the fire of the enemy as if rifle-pits had been thrown up.  Our\r\nline was generally along the crest of ridges.  The artillery was\r\nprotected by being sunk in the ground.  The men who were not serving the\r\nguns were perfectly covered from fire on taking position a little back\r\nfrom the crest.  The greatest suffering was from want of shelter.  It\r\nwas midwinter and during the siege we had rain and snow, thawing and\r\nfreezing alternately.  It would not do to allow camp-fires except far\r\ndown the hill out of sight of the enemy, and it would not do to allow\r\nmany of the troops to remain there at the same time.  In the march over\r\nfrom Fort Henry numbers of the men had thrown away their blankets and\r\novercoats.  There was therefore much discomfort and absolute suffering.\r\n\r\nDuring the 12th and 13th, and until the arrival of Wallace and Thayer on\r\nthe 14th, the National forces, composed of but 15,000 men, without\r\nintrenchments, confronted an intrenched army of 21,000, without conflict\r\nfurther than what was brought on by ourselves.  Only one gunboat had\r\narrived.  There was a little skirmishing each day, brought on by the\r\nmovement of our troops in securing commanding positions; but there was\r\nno actual fighting during this time except once, on the 13th, in front\r\nof McClernand's command.  That general had undertaken to capture a\r\nbattery of the enemy which was annoying his men.  Without orders or\r\nauthority he sent three regiments to make the assault.  The battery was\r\nin the main line of the enemy, which was defended by his whole army\r\npresent.  Of course the assault was a failure, and of course the loss on\r\nour side was great for the number of men engaged.  In this assault\r\nColonel William Morrison fell badly wounded.  Up to this time the\r\nsurgeons with the army had no difficulty in finding room in the houses\r\nnear our line for all the sick and wounded; but now hospitals were\r\novercrowded. Owing, however, to the energy and skill of the surgeons the\r\nsuffering was not so great as it might have been.  The hospital\r\narrangements at Fort Donelson were as complete as it was possible to\r\nmake them, considering the inclemency of the weather and the lack of\r\ntents, in a sparsely settled country where the houses were generally of\r\nbut one or two rooms.\r\n\r\nOn the return of Captain Walke to Fort Henry on the 10th, I had\r\nrequested him to take the vessels that had accompanied him on his\r\nexpedition up the Tennessee, and get possession of the Cumberland as far\r\nup towards Donelson as possible.  He started without delay, taking,\r\nhowever, only his own gunboat, the Carondelet, towed by the steamer\r\nAlps.  Captain Walke arrived a few miles below Donelson on the 12th, a\r\nlittle after noon. About the time the advance of troops reached a point\r\nwithin gunshot of the fort on the land side, he engaged the water\r\nbatteries at long range.  On the 13th I informed him of my arrival the\r\nday before and of the establishment of most of our batteries, requesting\r\nhim at the same time to attack again that day so that I might take\r\nadvantage of any diversion.  The attack was made and many shots fell\r\nwithin the fort, creating some consternation, as we now know.  The\r\ninvestment on the land side was made as complete as the number of troops\r\nengaged would admit of.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 13th Flag-officer Foote arrived with the\r\niron-clads St. Louis, Louisville and Pittsburg and the wooden gunboats\r\nTyler and Conestoga, convoying Thayer's brigade.  On the morning of the\r\n14th Thayer was landed.  Wallace, whom I had ordered over from Fort\r\nHenry, also arrived about the same time.  Up to this time he had been\r\ncommanding a brigade belonging to the division of General C. F. Smith.\r\nThese troops were now restored to the division they belonged to, and\r\nGeneral Lew. Wallace was assigned to the command of a division composed\r\nof the brigade of Colonel Thayer and other reinforcements that arrived\r\nthe same day.  This new division was assigned to the centre, giving the\r\ntwo flanking divisions an opportunity to close up and form a stronger\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe plan was for the troops to hold the enemy within his lines, while\r\nthe gunboats should attack the water batteries at close quarters and\r\nsilence his guns if possible.  Some of the gunboats were to run the\r\nbatteries, get above the fort and above the village of Dover.  I had\r\nordered a reconnoissance made with the view of getting troops to the\r\nriver above Dover in case they should be needed there.  That position\r\nattained by the gunboats it would have been but a question of time--and\r\na very short time, too--when the garrison would have been compelled to\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nBy three in the afternoon of the 14th Flag-officer Foote was ready, and\r\nadvanced upon the water batteries with his entire fleet.  After coming\r\nin range of the batteries of the enemy the advance was slow, but a\r\nconstant fire was delivered from every gun that could be brought to bear\r\nupon the fort.  I occupied a position on shore from which I could see\r\nthe advancing navy. The leading boat got within a very short distance of\r\nthe water battery, not further off I think than two hundred yards, and I\r\nsoon saw one and then another of them dropping down the river, visibly\r\ndisabled.  Then the whole fleet followed and the engagement closed for\r\nthe day.  The gunboat which Flag-officer Foote was on, besides having\r\nbeen hit about sixty times, several of the shots passing through near\r\nthe waterline, had a shot enter the pilot-house which killed the pilot,\r\ncarried away the wheel and wounded the flag-officer himself.  The\r\ntiller-ropes of another vessel were carried away and she, too, dropped\r\nhelplessly back.  Two others had their pilot-houses so injured that they\r\nscarcely formed a protection to the men at the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had evidently been much demoralized by the assault, but they\r\nwere jubilant when they saw the disabled vessels dropping down the river\r\nentirely out of the control of the men on board.  Of course I only\r\nwitnessed the falling back of our gunboats and felt sad enough at the\r\ntime over the repulse. Subsequent reports, now published, show that the\r\nenemy telegraphed a great victory to Richmond.  The sun went down on the\r\nnight of the 14th of February, 1862, leaving the army confronting Fort\r\nDonelson anything but comforted over the prospects.  The weather had\r\nturned intensely cold; the men were without tents and could not keep up\r\nfires where most of them had to stay, and, as previously stated, many\r\nhad thrown away their overcoats and blankets.  Two of the strongest of\r\nour gunboats had been disabled, presumably beyond the possibility of\r\nrendering any present assistance.  I retired this night not knowing but\r\nthat I would have to intrench my position, and bring up tents for the\r\nmen or build huts under the cover of the hills.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th, before it was yet broad day, a messenger\r\nfrom Flag-officer Foote handed me a note, expressing a desire to see me\r\non the flag-ship and saying that he had been injured the day before so\r\nmuch that he could not come himself to me.  I at once made my\r\npreparations for starting.  I directed my adjutant-general to notify\r\neach of the division commanders of my absence and instruct them to do\r\nnothing to bring on an engagement until they received further orders,\r\nbut to hold their positions.  From the heavy rains that had fallen for\r\ndays and weeks preceding and from the constant use of the roads between\r\nthe troops and the landing four to seven miles below, these roads had\r\nbecome cut up so as to be hardly passable.  The intense cold of the\r\nnight of the 14th-15th had frozen the ground solid.  This made travel on\r\nhorseback even slower than through the mud; but I went as fast as the\r\nroads would allow.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the fleet I found the flag-ship was anchored out in the\r\nstream.  A small boat, however, awaited my arrival and I was soon on\r\nboard with the flag-officer.  He explained to me in short the condition\r\nin which he was left by the engagement of the evening before, and\r\nsuggested that I should intrench while he returned to Mound City with\r\nhis disabled boats, expressing at the time the belief that he could have\r\nthe necessary repairs made and be back in ten days.  I saw the absolute\r\nnecessity of his gunboats going into hospital and did not know but I\r\nshould be forced to the alternative of going through a siege.  But the\r\nenemy relieved me from this necessity.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the National line to visit Flag-officer Foote I had no idea\r\nthat there would be any engagement on land unless I brought it on\r\nmyself.  The conditions for battle were much more favorable to us than\r\nthey had been for the first two days of the investment.  From the 12th\r\nto the 14th we had but 15,000 men of all arms and no gunboats.  Now we\r\nhad been reinforced by a fleet of six naval vessels, a large division of\r\ntroops under General L. Wallace and 2,500 men brought over from Fort\r\nHenry belonging to the division of C. F. Smith.  The enemy, however, had\r\ntaken the initiative.  Just as I landed I met Captain Hillyer of my\r\nstaff, white with fear, not for his personal safety, but for the safety\r\nof the National troops.  He said the enemy had come out of his lines in\r\nfull force and attacked and scattered McClernand's division, which was\r\nin full retreat.  The roads, as I have said, were unfit for making fast\r\ntime, but I got to my command as soon as possible.  The attack had been\r\nmade on the National right.  I was some four or five miles north of our\r\nleft.  The line was about three miles long.  In reaching the point where\r\nthe disaster had occurred I had to pass the divisions of Smith and\r\nWallace.  I saw no sign of excitement on the portion of the line held by\r\nSmith; Wallace was nearer the scene of conflict and had taken part in\r\nit.  He had, at an opportune time, sent Thayer's brigade to the support\r\nof McClernand and thereby contributed to hold the enemy within his\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nI saw everything favorable for us along the line of our left and centre.\r\nWhen I came to the right appearances were different. The enemy had come\r\nout in full force to cut his way out and make his escape.  McClernand's\r\ndivision had to bear the brunt of the attack from this combined force.\r\nHis men had stood up gallantly until the ammunition in their\r\ncartridge-boxes gave out.  There was abundance of ammunition near by\r\nlying on the ground in boxes, but at that stage of the war it was not\r\nall of our commanders of regiments, brigades, or even divisions, who had\r\nbeen educated up to the point of seeing that their men were constantly\r\nsupplied with ammunition during an engagement.  When the men found\r\nthemselves without ammunition they could not stand up against troops who\r\nseemed to have plenty of it.  The division broke and a portion fled, but\r\nmost of the men, as they were not pursued, only fell back out of range\r\nof the fire of the enemy. It must have been about this time that Thayer\r\npushed his brigade in between the enemy and those of our troops that\r\nwere without ammunition.  At all events the enemy fell back within his\r\nintrenchments and was there when I got on the field.\r\n\r\nI saw the men standing in knots talking in the most excited manner.  No\r\nofficer seemed to be giving any directions.  The soldiers had their\r\nmuskets, but no ammunition, while there were tons of it close at hand.\r\nI heard some of the men say that the enemy had come out with knapsacks,\r\nand haversacks filled with rations.  They seemed to think this indicated\r\na determination on his part to stay out and fight just as long as the\r\nprovisions held out.  I turned to Colonel J. D. Webster, of my staff,\r\nwho was with me, and said:  \"Some of our men are pretty badly\r\ndemoralized, but the enemy must be more so, for he has attempted to\r\nforce his way out, but has fallen back:  the one who attacks first now\r\nwill be victorious and the enemy will have to be in a hurry if he gets\r\nahead of me.\"  I determined to make the assault at once on our left.  It\r\nwas clear to my mind that the enemy had started to march out with his\r\nentire force, except a few pickets, and if our attack could be made on\r\nthe left before the enemy could redistribute his forces along the line,\r\nwe would find but little opposition except from the intervening _abatis_.\r\nI directed Colonel Webster to ride with me and call out to the men as we\r\npassed:  \"Fill your cartridge-boxes, quick, and get into line; the enemy\r\nis trying to escape and he must not be permitted to do so.\"  This acted\r\nlike a charm.  The men only wanted some one to give them a command.  We\r\nrode rapidly to Smith's quarters, when I explained the situation to him\r\nand directed him to charge the enemy's works in his front with his whole\r\ndivision, saying at the same time that he would find nothing but a very\r\nthin line to contend with.  The general was off in an incredibly short\r\ntime, going in advance himself to keep his men from firing while they\r\nwere working their way through the _abatis_ intervening between them and\r\nthe enemy.  The outer line of rifle-pits was passed, and the night of\r\nthe 15th General Smith, with much of his division, bivouacked within the\r\nlines of the enemy.  There was now no doubt but that the Confederates\r\nmust surrender or be captured the next day.\r\n\r\nThere seems from subsequent accounts to have been much consternation,\r\nparticularly among the officers of high rank, in Dover during the night\r\nof the 15th.  General Floyd, the commanding officer, who was a man of\r\ntalent enough for any civil position, was no soldier and, possibly, did\r\nnot possess the elements of one.  He was further unfitted for command,\r\nfor the reason that his conscience must have troubled him and made him\r\nafraid.  As Secretary of War he had taken a solemn oath to maintain the\r\nConstitution of the United States and to uphold the same against all its\r\nenemies.  He had betrayed that trust.  As Secretary of War he was\r\nreported through the northern press to have scattered the little army\r\nthe country had so that the most of it could be picked up in detail when\r\nsecession occurred. About a year before leaving the Cabinet he had\r\nremoved arms from northern to southern arsenals.  He continued in the\r\nCabinet of President Buchanan until about the 1st of January, 1861,\r\nwhile he was working vigilantly for the establishment of a confederacy\r\nmade out of United States territory.  Well may he have been afraid to\r\nfall into the hands of National troops.  He would no doubt have been\r\ntried for misappropriating public property, if not for treason, had he\r\nbeen captured.  General Pillow, next in command, was conceited, and\r\nprided himself much on his services in the Mexican war.  He telegraphed\r\nto General Johnston, at Nashville, after our men were within the rebel\r\nrifle-pits, and almost on the eve of his making his escape, that the\r\nSouthern troops had had great success all day.  Johnston forwarded the\r\ndispatch to Richmond.  While the authorities at the capital were reading\r\nit Floyd and Pillow were fugitives.\r\n\r\nA council of war was held by the enemy at which all agreed that it would\r\nbe impossible to hold out longer.  General Buckner, who was third in\r\nrank in the garrison but much the most capable soldier, seems to have\r\nregarded it a duty to hold the fort until the general commanding the\r\ndepartment, A. S. Johnston, should get back to his headquarters at\r\nNashville.  Buckner's report shows, however, that he considered Donelson\r\nlost and that any attempt to hold the place longer would be at the\r\nsacrifice of the command.  Being assured that Johnston was already in\r\nNashville, Buckner too agreed that surrender was the proper thing.\r\nFloyd turned over the command to Pillow, who declined it.  It then\r\ndevolved upon Buckner, who accepted the responsibility of the position.\r\nFloyd and Pillow took possession of all the river transports at Dover\r\nand before morning both were on their way to Nashville, with the brigade\r\nformerly commanded by Floyd and some other troops, in all about 3,000.\r\nSome marched up the east bank of the Cumberland; others went on the\r\nsteamers.  During the night Forrest also, with his cavalry and some\r\nother troops about a thousand in all, made their way out, passing\r\nbetween our right and the river.  They had to ford or swim over the\r\nback-water in the little creek just south of Dover.\r\n\r\nBefore daylight General Smith brought to me the following letter from\r\nGeneral Buckner:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS, FORT DONELSON, February 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nSIR:--In consideration of all the circumstances governing the present\r\nsituation of affairs at this station, I propose to the Commanding\r\nOfficer of the Federal forces the appointment of Commissioners to agree\r\nupon terms of capitulation of the forces and fort under my command, and\r\nin that view suggest an armistice until 12 o'clock to-day.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, Your ob't se'v't, S. B. BUCKNER, Brig.\r\nGen. C. S. A.\r\n\r\nTo Brigadier-General U. S. Grant, Com'ding U. S. Forces, Near Fort\r\nDonelson.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this I responded as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY IN THE FIELD, Camp near Donelson, February 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nGeneral S. B. BUCKNER, Confederate Army.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Yours of this date, proposing armistice and appointment of\r\nCommissioners to settle terms of capitulation, is just received.  No\r\nterms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted.\r\nI propose to move immediately upon your works.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, Your ob't se'v't, U. S. GRANT, Brig. Gen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this I received the following reply:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS, DOVER, TENNESSEE, February 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nTo Brig. Gen'l U. S. GRANT, U. S. Army.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The distribution of the forces under my command, incident to an\r\nunexpected change of commanders, and the overwhelming force under your\r\ncommand, compel me, notwithstanding the brilliant success of the\r\nConfederate arms yesterday, to accept the ungenerous and unchivalrous\r\nterms which you propose.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, Your very ob't se'v't, S. B. BUCKNER, Brig. Gen. C. S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Buckner, as soon as he had dispatched the first of the above\r\nletters, sent word to his different commanders on the line of\r\nrifle-pits, notifying them that he had made a proposition looking to the\r\nsurrender of the garrison, and directing them to notify National troops\r\nin their front so that all fighting might be prevented.  White flags\r\nwere stuck at intervals along the line of rifle-pits, but none over the\r\nfort.  As soon as the last letter from Buckner was received I mounted my\r\nhorse and rode to Dover.  General Wallace, I found, had preceded me an\r\nhour or more.  I presume that, seeing white flags exposed in his front,\r\nhe rode up to see what they meant and, not being fired upon or halted,\r\nhe kept on until he found himself at the headquarters of General\r\nBuckner.\r\n\r\nI had been at West Point three years with Buckner and afterwards served\r\nwith him in the army, so that we were quite well acquainted.  In the\r\ncourse of our conversation, which was very friendly, he said to me that\r\nif he had been in command I would not have got up to Donelson as easily\r\nas I did.  I told him that if he had been in command I should not have\r\ntried in the way I did:  I had invested their lines with a smaller force\r\nthan they had to defend them, and at the same time had sent a brigade\r\nfull 5,000 strong, around by water; I had relied very much upon their\r\ncommander to allow me to come safely up to the outside of their works.\r\nI asked General Buckner about what force he had to surrender.  He\r\nreplied that he could not tell with any degree of accuracy; that all the\r\nsick and weak had been sent to Nashville while we were about Fort Henry;\r\nthat Floyd and Pillow had left during the night, taking many men with\r\nthem; and that Forrest, and probably others, had also escaped during the\r\npreceding night:  the number of casualties he could not tell; but he\r\nsaid I would not find fewer than 12,000, nor more than 15,000.\r\n\r\nHe asked permission to send parties outside of the lines to bury his\r\ndead, who had fallen on the 15th when they tried to get out.  I gave\r\ndirections that his permit to pass our limits should be recognized.  I\r\nhave no reason to believe that this privilege was abused, but it\r\nfamiliarized our guards so much with the sight of Confederates passing\r\nto and fro that I have no doubt many got beyond our pickets unobserved\r\nand went on.  The most of the men who went in that way no doubt thought\r\nthey had had war enough, and left with the intention of remaining out of\r\nthe army.  Some came to me and asked permission to go, saying that they\r\nwere tired of the war and would not be caught in the ranks again, and I\r\nbade them go.\r\n\r\nThe actual number of Confederates at Fort Donelson can never be given\r\nwith entire accuracy.  The largest number admitted by any writer on the\r\nSouthern side, is by Colonel Preston Johnston.  He gives the number at\r\n17,000.  But this must be an underestimate. The commissary general of\r\nprisoners reported having issued rations to 14,623 Fort Donelson\r\nprisoners at Cairo, as they passed that point.  General Pillow reported\r\nthe killed and wounded at 2,000; but he had less opportunity of knowing\r\nthe actual numbers than the officers of McClernand's division, for most\r\nof the killed and wounded fell outside their works, in front of that\r\ndivision, and were buried or cared for by Buckner after the surrender\r\nand when Pillow was a fugitive.  It is known that Floyd and Pillow\r\nescaped during the night of the 15th, taking with them not less than\r\n3,000 men.  Forrest escaped with about 1,000 and others were leaving\r\nsingly and in squads all night.  It is probable that the Confederate\r\nforce at Donelson, on the 15th of February, 1862, was 21,000 in round\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nOn the day Fort Donelson fell I had 27,000 men to confront the\r\nConfederate lines and guard the road four or five miles to the left,\r\nover which all our supplies had to be drawn on wagons. During the 16th,\r\nafter the surrender, additional reinforcements arrived.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege General Sherman had been sent to Smithland, at the\r\nmouth of the Cumberland River, to forward reinforcements and supplies to\r\nme.  At that time he was my senior in rank and there was no authority of\r\nlaw to assign a junior to command a senior of the same grade.  But every\r\nboat that came up with supplies or reinforcements brought a note of\r\nencouragement from Sherman, asking me to call upon him for any\r\nassistance he could render and saying that if he could be of service at\r\nthe front I might send for him and he would waive rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nPROMOTED MAJOR-GENERAL OF VOLUNTEERS--UNOCCUPIED TERRITORY--ADVANCE UPON\r\nNASHVILLE--SITUATION OF THE TROOPS--CONFEDERATE RETREAT--RELIEVED OF THE\r\nCOMMAND--RESTORED TO THE COMMAND--GENERAL SMITH.\r\n\r\nThe news of the fall of Fort Donelson caused great delight all over the\r\nNorth.  At the South, particularly in Richmond, the effect was\r\ncorrespondingly depressing.  I was promptly promoted to the grade of\r\nMajor-General of Volunteers, and confirmed by the Senate.  All three of\r\nmy division commanders were promoted to the same grade and the colonels\r\nwho commanded brigades were made brigadier-generals in the volunteer\r\nservice.  My chief, who was in St. Louis, telegraphed his\r\ncongratulations to General Hunter in Kansas for the services he had\r\nrendered in securing the fall of Fort Donelson by sending reinforcements\r\nso rapidly.  To Washington he telegraphed that the victory was due to\r\nGeneral C. F. Smith; \"promote him,\" he said, \"and the whole country will\r\napplaud.\"  On the 19th there was published at St. Louis a formal order\r\nthanking Flag-officer Foote and myself, and the forces under our\r\ncommand, for the victories on the Tennessee and the Cumberland.  I\r\nreceived no other recognition whatever from General Halleck.  But\r\nGeneral Cullum, his chief of staff, who was at Cairo, wrote me a warm\r\ncongratulatory letter on his own behalf.  I approved of General Smith's\r\npromotion highly, as I did all the promotions that were made.\r\n\r\nMy opinion was and still is that immediately after the fall of Fort\r\nDonelson the way was opened to the National forces all over the\r\nSouth-west without much resistance.  If one general who would have taken\r\nthe responsibility had been in command of all the troops west of the\r\nAlleghanies, he could have marched to Chattanooga, Corinth, Memphis and\r\nVicksburg with the troops we then had, and as volunteering was going on\r\nrapidly over the North there would soon have been force enough at all\r\nthese centres to operate offensively against any body of the enemy that\r\nmight be found near them.  Rapid movements and the acquisition of\r\nrebellious territory would have promoted volunteering, so that\r\nreinforcements could have been had as fast as transportation could have\r\nbeen obtained to carry them to their destination.  On the other hand\r\nthere were tens of thousands of strong able-bodied young men still at\r\ntheir homes in the South-western States, who had not gone into the\r\nConfederate army in February, 1862, and who had no particular desire to\r\ngo.  If our lines had been extended to protect their homes, many of them\r\nnever would have gone.  Providence ruled differently.  Time was given\r\nthe enemy to collect armies and fortify his new positions; and twice\r\nafterwards he came near forcing his north-western front up to the Ohio\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nI promptly informed the department commander of our success at Fort\r\nDonelson and that the way was open now to Clarksville and Nashville; and\r\nthat unless I received orders to the contrary I should take Clarksville\r\non the 21st and Nashville about the 1st of March.  Both these places are\r\non the Cumberland River above Fort Donelson.  As I heard nothing from\r\nheadquarters on the subject, General C. F. Smith was sent to Clarksville\r\nat the time designated and found the place evacuated.  The capture of\r\nforts Henry and Donelson had broken the line the enemy had taken from\r\nColumbus to Bowling Green, and it was known that he was falling back\r\nfrom the eastern point of this line and that Buell was following, or at\r\nleast advancing.  I should have sent troops to Nashville at the time I\r\nsent to Clarksville, but my transportation was limited and there were\r\nmany prisoners to be forwarded north.\r\n\r\nNone of the reinforcements from Buell's army arrived until the 24th of\r\nFebruary.  Then General Nelson came up, with orders to report to me with\r\ntwo brigades, he having sent one brigade to Cairo.  I knew General Buell\r\nwas advancing on Nashville from the north, and I was advised by scouts\r\nthat the rebels were leaving that place, and trying to get out all the\r\nsupplies they could. Nashville was, at that time, one of the best\r\nprovisioned posts in the South.  I had no use for reinforcements now,\r\nand thinking Buell would like to have his troops again, I ordered Nelson\r\nto proceed to Nashville without debarking at Fort Donelson.  I sent a\r\ngunboat also as a convoy.  The Cumberland River was very high at the\r\ntime; the railroad bridge at Nashville had been burned, and all river\r\ncraft had been destroyed, or would be before the enemy left.  Nashville\r\nis on the west bank of the Cumberland, and Buell was approaching from\r\nthe east.  I thought the steamers carrying Nelson's division would be\r\nuseful in ferrying the balance of Buell's forces across.  I ordered\r\nNelson to put himself in communication with Buell as soon as possible,\r\nand if he found him more than two days off from Nashville to return\r\nbelow the city and await orders.  Buell, however, had already arrived in\r\nperson at Edgefield, opposite Nashville, and Mitchell's division of his\r\ncommand reached there the same day. Nelson immediately took possession\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nAfter Nelson had gone and before I had learned of Buell's arrival, I\r\nsent word to department headquarters that I should go to Nashville\r\nmyself on the 28th if I received no orders to the contrary.  Hearing\r\nnothing, I went as I had informed my superior officer I would do.  On\r\narriving at Clarksville I saw a fleet of steamers at the shore--the same\r\nthat had taken Nelson's division--and troops going aboard.  I landed and\r\ncalled on the commanding officer, General C. F. Smith.  As soon as he\r\nsaw me he showed an order he had just received from Buell in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\r\nNASHVILLE, February 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL C. F. SMITH, Commanding U. S. Forces, Clarksville.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--The landing of a portion of our troops, contrary to my\r\nintentions, on the south side of the river has compelled me to hold this\r\nside at every hazard.  If the enemy should assume the offensive, and I\r\nam assured by reliable persons that in view of my position such is his\r\nintention, my force present is altogether inadequate, consisting of only\r\n15,000 men.  I have to request you, therefore, to come forward with all\r\nthe available force under your command.  So important do I consider the\r\noccasion that I think it necessary to give this communication all the\r\nforce of orders, and I send four boats, the Diana, Woodford, John Rain,\r\nand Autocrat, to bring you up.  In five or six days my force will\r\nprobably be sufficient to relieve you.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your ob't srv't, D. C. BUELL, Brigadier-General\r\nComd'g.\r\n\r\nP. S.--The steamers will leave here at 12 o'clock to-night.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Smith said this order was nonsense.  But I told him it was\r\nbetter to obey it.  The General replied, \"of course I must obey,\" and\r\nsaid his men were embarking as fast as they could.  I went on up to\r\nNashville and inspected the position taken by Nelson's troops.  I did\r\nnot see Buell during the day, and wrote him a note saying that I had\r\nbeen in Nashville since early morning and had hoped to meet him.  On my\r\nreturn to the boat we met.  His troops were still east of the river, and\r\nthe steamers that had carried Nelson's division up were mostly at\r\nClarksville to bring Smith's division.  I said to General Buell my\r\ninformation was that the enemy was retreating as fast as possible.\r\nGeneral Buell said there was fighting going on then only ten or twelve\r\nmiles away.  I said:  \"Quite probably; Nashville contained valuable\r\nstores of arms, ammunition and provisions, and the enemy is probably\r\ntrying to carry away all he can.  The fighting is doubtless with the\r\nrear-guard who are trying to protect the trains they are getting away\r\nwith.\"  Buell spoke very positively of the danger Nashville was in of an\r\nattack from the enemy.  I said, in the absence of positive information,\r\nI believed my information was correct.  He responded that he \"knew.\"\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I do not know; but as I came by Clarksville General\r\nSmith's troops were embarking to join you.\"\r\n\r\nSmith's troops were returned the same day.  The enemy were trying to get\r\naway from Nashville and not to return to it.\r\n\r\nAt this time General Albert Sidney Johnston commanded all the\r\nConfederate troops west of the Alleghany Mountains, with the exception\r\nof those in the extreme south.  On the National side the forces\r\nconfronting him were divided into, at first three, then four separate\r\ndepartments.  Johnston had greatly the advantage in having supreme\r\ncommand over all troops that could possibly be brought to bear upon one\r\npoint, while the forces similarly situated on the National side, divided\r\ninto independent commands, could not be brought into harmonious action\r\nexcept by orders from Washington.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1862 Johnston's troops east of the Mississippi\r\noccupied a line extending from Columbus, on his left, to Mill Springs,\r\non his right.  As we have seen, Columbus, both banks of the Tennessee\r\nRiver, the west bank of the Cumberland and Bowling Green, all were\r\nstrongly fortified.  Mill Springs was intrenched.  The National troops\r\noccupied no territory south of the Ohio, except three small garrisons\r\nalong its bank and a force thrown out from Louisville to confront that\r\nat Bowling Green.  Johnston's strength was no doubt numerically inferior\r\nto that of the National troops; but this was compensated for by the\r\nadvantage of being sole commander of all the Confederate forces at the\r\nWest, and of operating in a country where his friends would take care of\r\nhis rear without any detail of soldiers.  But when General George H.\r\nThomas moved upon the enemy at Mill Springs and totally routed him,\r\ninflicting a loss of some 300 killed and wounded, and forts Henry and\r\nHeiman fell into the hands of the National forces, with their armaments\r\nand about 100 prisoners, those losses seemed to dishearten the\r\nConfederate commander so much that he immediately commenced a retreat\r\nfrom Bowling Green on Nashville.  He reached this latter place on the\r\n14th of February, while Donelson was still besieged.  Buell followed\r\nwith a portion of the Army of the Ohio, but he had to march and did not\r\nreach the east bank of the Cumberland opposite Nashville until the 24th\r\nof the month, and then with only one division of his army.\r\n\r\nThe bridge at Nashville had been destroyed and all boats removed or\r\ndisabled, so that a small garrison could have held the place against any\r\nNational troops that could have been brought against it within ten days\r\nafter the arrival of the force from Bowling Green.  Johnston seemed to\r\nlie quietly at Nashville to await the result at Fort Donelson, on which\r\nhe had staked the possession of most of the territory embraced in the\r\nStates of Kentucky and Tennessee.  It is true, the two generals senior\r\nin rank at Fort Donelson were sending him encouraging dispatches, even\r\nclaiming great Confederate victories up to the night of the 16th when\r\nthey must have been preparing for their individual escape. Johnston made\r\na fatal mistake in intrusting so important a command to Floyd, who he\r\nmust have known was no soldier even if he possessed the elements of one.\r\nPillow's presence as second was also a mistake.  If these officers had\r\nbeen forced upon him and designated for that particular command, then he\r\nshould have left Nashville with a small garrison under a trusty officer,\r\nand with the remainder of his force gone to Donelson himself.  If he had\r\nbeen captured the result could not have been worse than it was.\r\n\r\nJohnston's heart failed him upon the first advance of National troops.\r\nHe wrote to Richmond on the 8th of February, \"I think the gunboats of\r\nthe enemy will probably take Fort Donelson without the necessity of\r\nemploying their land force in cooperation.\"  After the fall of that\r\nplace he abandoned Nashville and Chattanooga without an effort to save\r\neither, and fell back into northern Mississippi, where, six weeks later,\r\nhe was destined to end his career.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of leaving Cairo I was singularly unfortunate in not\r\nreceiving dispatches from General Halleck.  The order of the 10th of\r\nFebruary directing me to fortify Fort Henry strongly, particularly to\r\nthe land side, and saying that intrenching tools had been sent for that\r\npurpose, reached me after Donelson was invested.  I received nothing\r\ndirect which indicated that the department commander knew we were in\r\npossession of Donelson.  I was reporting regularly to the chief of\r\nstaff, who had been sent to Cairo, soon after the troops left there, to\r\nreceive all reports from the front and to telegraph the substance to the\r\nSt. Louis headquarters.  Cairo was at the southern end of the telegraph\r\nwire.  Another line was started at once from Cairo to Paducah and\r\nSmithland, at the mouths of the Tennessee and Cumberland respectively.\r\nMy dispatches were all sent to Cairo by boat, but many of those\r\naddressed to me were sent to the operator at the end of the advancing\r\nwire and he failed to forward them.  This operator afterwards proved to\r\nbe a rebel; he deserted his post after a short time and went south\r\ntaking his dispatches with him.  A telegram from General McClellan to me\r\nof February 16th, the day of the surrender, directing me to report in\r\nfull the situation, was not received at my headquarters until the 3d of\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of March I received orders dated March 1st to move my command\r\nback to Fort Henry, leaving only a small garrison at Donelson.  From\r\nFort Henry expeditions were to be sent against Eastport, Mississippi,\r\nand Paris, Tennessee.  We started from Donelson on the 4th, and the same\r\nday I was back on the Tennessee River.  On March 4th I also received the\r\nfollowing dispatch from General Halleck:\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJ.-GEN. U. S. GRANT, Fort Henry:\r\n\r\nYou will place Maj.-Gen. C. F. Smith in command of expedition, and\r\nremain yourself at Fort Henry.  Why do you not obey my orders to report\r\nstrength and positions of your command?\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was surprised.  This was the first intimation I had received that\r\nGeneral Halleck had called for information as to the strength of my\r\ncommand.  On the 6th he wrote to me again.  \"Your going to Nashville\r\nwithout authority, and when your presence with your troops was of the\r\nutmost importance, was a matter of very serious complaint at Washington,\r\nso much so that I was advised to arrest you on your return.\"  This was\r\nthe first I knew of his objecting to my going to Nashville.  That place\r\nwas not beyond the limits of my command, which, it had been expressly\r\ndeclared in orders, were \"not defined.\"  Nashville is west of the\r\nCumberland River, and I had sent troops that had reported to me for duty\r\nto occupy the place.  I turned over the command as directed and then\r\nreplied to General Halleck courteously, but asked to be relieved from\r\nfurther duty under him.\r\n\r\nLater I learned that General Halleck had been calling lustily for more\r\ntroops, promising that he would do something important if he could only\r\nbe sufficiently reinforced.  McClellan asked him what force he then had.\r\nHalleck telegraphed me to supply the information so far as my command\r\nwas concerned, but I received none of his dispatches.  At last Halleck\r\nreported to Washington that he had repeatedly ordered me to give the\r\nstrength of my force, but could get nothing out of me; that I had gone\r\nto Nashville, beyond the limits of my command, without his authority,\r\nand that my army was more demoralized by victory than the army at Bull\r\nRun had been by defeat.  General McClellan, on this information, ordered\r\nthat I should be relieved from duty and that an investigation should be\r\nmade into any charges against me.  He even authorized my arrest.  Thus\r\nin less than two weeks after the victory at Donelson, the two leading\r\ngenerals in the army were in correspondence as to what disposition\r\nshould be made of me, and in less than three weeks I was virtually in\r\narrest and without a command.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of March I was restored to command, and on the 17th Halleck\r\nsent me a copy of an order from the War Department which stated that\r\naccounts of my misbehavior had reached Washington and directed him to\r\ninvestigate and report the facts.  He forwarded also a copy of a\r\ndetailed dispatch from himself to Washington entirely exonerating me;\r\nbut he did not inform me that it was his own reports that had created\r\nall the trouble.  On the contrary, he wrote to me, \"Instead of relieving\r\nyou, I wish you, as soon as your new army is in the field, to assume\r\nimmediate command, and lead it to new victories.\"  In consequence I felt\r\nvery grateful to him, and supposed it was his interposition that had set\r\nme right with the government.  I never knew the truth until General\r\nBadeau unearthed the facts in his researches for his history of my\r\ncampaigns.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck unquestionably deemed General C. F. Smith a much fitter\r\nofficer for the command of all the forces in the military district than\r\nI was, and, to render him available for such command, desired his\r\npromotion to antedate mine and those of the other division commanders.\r\nIt is probable that the general opinion was that Smith's long services\r\nin the army and distinguished deeds rendered him the more proper person\r\nfor such command.  Indeed I was rather inclined to this opinion myself\r\nat that time, and would have served as faithfully under Smith as he had\r\ndone under me.  But this did not justify the dispatches which General\r\nHalleck sent to Washington, or his subsequent concealment of them from\r\nme when pretending to explain the action of my superiors.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the order restoring me to command I proceeded to Savannah\r\non the Tennessee, to which point my troops had advanced.  General Smith\r\nwas delighted to see me and was unhesitating in his denunciation of the\r\ntreatment I had received.  He was on a sick bed at the time, from which\r\nhe never came away alive.  His death was a severe loss to our western\r\narmy.  His personal courage was unquestioned, his judgment and\r\nprofessional acquirements were unsurpassed, and he had the confidence\r\nof those he commanded as well as of those over him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY AT PITTSBURG LANDING--INJURED BY A FALL--THE CONFEDERATE ATTACK\r\nAT SHILOH--THE FIRST DAY'S FIGHT AT SHILOH--GENERAL SHERMAN--CONDITION\r\nOF THE ARMY--CLOSE OF THE FIRST DAY'S FIGHT--THE SECOND DAY'S FIGHT\r\n--RETREAT AND DEFEAT OF THE CONFEDERATES.\r\n\r\nWhen I reassumed command on the 17th of March I found the army divided,\r\nabout half being on the east bank of the Tennessee at Savannah, while\r\none division was at Crump's landing on the west bank about four miles\r\nhigher up, and the remainder at Pittsburg landing, five miles above\r\nCrump's.  The enemy was in force at Corinth, the junction of the two\r\nmost important railroads in the Mississippi valley--one connecting\r\nMemphis and the Mississippi River with the East, and the other leading\r\nsouth to all the cotton states.  Still another railroad connects Corinth\r\nwith Jackson, in west Tennessee.  If we obtained possession of Corinth\r\nthe enemy would have no railroad for the transportation of armies or\r\nsupplies until that running east from Vicksburg was reached.  It was the\r\ngreat strategic position at the West between the Tennessee and the\r\nMississippi rivers and between Nashville and Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nI at once put all the troops at Savannah in motion for Pittsburg\r\nlanding, knowing that the enemy was fortifying at Corinth and collecting\r\nan army there under Johnston.  It was my expectation to march against\r\nthat army as soon as Buell, who had been ordered to reinforce me with\r\nthe Army of the Ohio, should arrive; and the west bank of the river was\r\nthe place to start from.  Pittsburg is only about twenty miles from\r\nCorinth, and Hamburg landing, four miles further up the river, is a mile\r\nor two nearer.  I had not been in command long before I selected Hamburg\r\nas the place to put the Army of the Ohio when it arrived.  The roads\r\nfrom Pittsburg and Hamburg to Corinth converge some eight miles out.\r\nThis disposition of the troops would have given additional roads to\r\nmarch over when the advance commenced, within supporting distance of\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nBefore I arrived at Savannah, Sherman, who had joined the Army of the\r\nTennessee and been placed in command of a division, had made an\r\nexpedition on steamers convoyed by gunboats to the neighborhood of\r\nEastport, thirty miles south, for the purpose of destroying the railroad\r\neast of Corinth.  The rains had been so heavy for some time before that\r\nthe low-lands had become impassable swamps.  Sherman debarked his troops\r\nand started out to accomplish the object of the expedition; but the\r\nriver was rising so rapidly that the back-water up the small tributaries\r\nthreatened to cut off the possibility of getting back to the boats, and\r\nthe expedition had to return without reaching the railroad.  The guns\r\nhad to be hauled by hand through the water to get back to the boats.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of March the army on the Tennessee River consisted of five\r\ndivisions, commanded respectively by Generals C. F. Smith, McClernand,\r\nL. Wallace, Hurlbut and Sherman.  General W. H. L. Wallace was\r\ntemporarily in command of Smith's division, General Smith, as I have\r\nsaid, being confined to his bed. Reinforcements were arriving daily and\r\nas they came up they were organized, first into brigades, then into a\r\ndivision, and the command given to General Prentiss, who had been\r\nordered to report to me.  General Buell was on his way from Nashville\r\nwith 40,000 veterans.  On the 19th of March he was at Columbia,\r\nTennessee, eighty-five miles from Pittsburg.  When all reinforcements\r\nshould have arrived I expected to take the initiative by marching on\r\nCorinth, and had no expectation of needing fortifications, though this\r\nsubject was taken into consideration.  McPherson, my only military\r\nengineer, was directed to lay out a line to intrench.  He did so, but\r\nreported that it would have to be made in rear of the line of encampment\r\nas it then ran.  The new line, while it would be nearer the river, was\r\nyet too far away from the Tennessee, or even from the creeks, to be\r\neasily supplied with water, and in case of attack these creeks would be\r\nin the hands of the enemy.  The fact is, I regarded the campaign we were\r\nengaged in as an offensive one and had no idea that the enemy would\r\nleave strong intrenchments to take the initiative when he knew he would\r\nbe attacked where he was if he remained.  This view, however, did not\r\nprevent every precaution being taken and every effort made to keep\r\nadvised of all movements of the enemy.\r\n\r\nJohnston's cavalry meanwhile had been well out towards our front, and\r\noccasional encounters occurred between it and our outposts.  On the 1st\r\nof April this cavalry became bold and approached our lines, showing that\r\nan advance of some kind was contemplated.  On the 2d Johnston left\r\nCorinth in force to attack my army.  On the 4th his cavalry dashed down\r\nand captured a small picket guard of six or seven men, stationed some\r\nfive miles out from Pittsburg on the Corinth road.  Colonel Buckland\r\nsent relief to the guard at once and soon followed in person with an\r\nentire regiment, and General Sherman followed Buckland taking the\r\nremainder of a brigade.  The pursuit was kept up for some three miles\r\nbeyond the point where the picket guard had been captured, and after\r\nnightfall Sherman returned to camp and reported to me by letter what had\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nAt this time a large body of the enemy was hovering to the west of us,\r\nalong the line of the Mobile and Ohio railroad.  My apprehension was\r\nmuch greater for the safety of Crump's landing than it was for\r\nPittsburg.  I had no apprehension that the enemy could really capture\r\neither place.  But I feared it was possible that he might make a rapid\r\ndash upon Crump's and destroy our transports and stores, most of which\r\nwere kept at that point, and then retreat before Wallace could be\r\nreinforced.  Lew. Wallace's position I regarded as so well chosen that\r\nhe was not removed.\r\n\r\nAt this time I generally spent the day at Pittsburg and returned to\r\nSavannah in the evening.  I was intending to remove my headquarters to\r\nPittsburg, but Buell was expected daily and would come in at Savannah.\r\nI remained at this point, therefore, a few days longer than I otherwise\r\nshould have done, in order to meet him on his arrival.  The skirmishing\r\nin our front, however, had been so continuous from about the 3d of April\r\nthat I did not leave Pittsburg each night until an hour when I felt\r\nthere would be no further danger before the morning.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the 4th, the day of Buckland's advance, I was very much\r\ninjured by my horse falling with me, and on me, while I was trying to\r\nget to the front where firing had been heard.  The night was one of\r\nimpenetrable darkness, with rain pouring down in torrents; nothing was\r\nvisible to the eye except as revealed by the frequent flashes of\r\nlightning.  Under these circumstances I had to trust to the horse,\r\nwithout guidance, to keep the road.  I had not gone far, however, when I\r\nmet General W. H. L. Wallace and Colonel (afterwards General) McPherson\r\ncoming from the direction of the front.  They said all was quiet so far\r\nas the enemy was concerned.  On the way back to the boat my horse's feet\r\nslipped from under him, and he fell with my leg under his body.  The\r\nextreme softness of the ground, from the excessive rains of the few\r\npreceding days, no doubt saved me from a severe injury and protracted\r\nlameness.  As it was, my ankle was very much injured, so much so that my\r\nboot had to be cut off.  For two or three days after I was unable to\r\nwalk except with crutches.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th General Nelson, with a division of Buell's army, arrived at\r\nSavannah and I ordered him to move up the east bank of the river, to be\r\nin a position where he could be ferried over to Crump's landing or\r\nPittsburg as occasion required.  I had learned that General Buell\r\nhimself would be at Savannah the next day, and desired to meet me on his\r\narrival.  Affairs at Pittsburg landing had been such for several days\r\nthat I did not want to be away during the day.  I determined, therefore,\r\nto take a very early breakfast and ride out to meet Buell, and thus save\r\ntime.  He had arrived on the evening of the 5th, but had not advised me\r\nof the fact and I was not aware of it until some time after.  While I\r\nwas at breakfast, however, heavy firing was heard in the direction of\r\nPittsburg landing, and I hastened there, sending a hurried note to Buell\r\ninforming him of the reason why I could not meet him at Savannah.  On\r\nthe way up the river I directed the dispatch-boat to run in close to\r\nCrump's landing, so that I could communicate with General Lew. Wallace.\r\nI found him waiting on a boat apparently expecting to see me, and I\r\ndirected him to get his troops in line ready to execute any orders he\r\nmight receive.  He replied that his troops were already under arms and\r\nprepared to move.\r\n\r\nUp to that time I had felt by no means certain that Crump's landing\r\nmight not be the point of attack.  On reaching the front, however, about\r\neight A.M., I found that the attack on Pittsburg was unmistakable, and\r\nthat nothing more than a small guard, to protect our transports and\r\nstores, was needed at Crump's.  Captain Baxter, a quartermaster on my\r\nstaff, was accordingly directed to go back and order General Wallace to\r\nmarch immediately to Pittsburg by the road nearest the river. Captain\r\nBaxter made a memorandum of this order.  About one P.M., not hearing\r\nfrom Wallace and being much in need of reinforcements, I sent two more\r\nof my staff, Colonel McPherson and Captain Rowley, to bring him up with\r\nhis division.  They reported finding him marching towards Purdy, Bethel,\r\nor some point west from the river, and farther from Pittsburg by several\r\nmiles than when he started.  The road from his first position to\r\nPittsburg landing was direct and near the river.  Between the two points\r\na bridge had been built across Snake Creek by our troops, at which\r\nWallace's command had assisted, expressly to enable the troops at the\r\ntwo places to support each other in case of need.  Wallace did not\r\narrive in time to take part in the first day's fight.  General Wallace\r\nhas since claimed that the order delivered to him by Captain Baxter was\r\nsimply to join the right of the army, and that the road over which he\r\nmarched would have taken him to the road from Pittsburg to Purdy where\r\nit crosses Owl Creek on the right of Sherman; but this is not where I\r\nhad ordered him nor where I wanted him to go.\r\n\r\nI never could see and do not now see why any order was necessary further\r\nthan to direct him to come to Pittsburg landing, without specifying by\r\nwhat route.  His was one of three veteran divisions that had been in\r\nbattle, and its absence was severely felt.  Later in the war General\r\nWallace would not have made the mistake that he committed on the 6th of\r\nApril, 1862.  I presume his idea was that by taking the route he did he\r\nwould be able to come around on the flank or rear of the enemy, and thus\r\nperform an act of heroism that would redound to the credit of his\r\ncommand, as well as to the benefit of his country.\r\n\r\nSome two or three miles from Pittsburg landing was a log meeting-house\r\ncalled Shiloh.  It stood on the ridge which divides the waters of Snake\r\nand Lick creeks, the former emptying into the Tennessee just north of\r\nPittsburg landing, and the latter south.  This point was the key to our\r\nposition and was held by Sherman.  His division was at that time wholly\r\nraw, no part of it ever having been in an engagement; but I thought this\r\ndeficiency was more than made up by the superiority of the commander.\r\nMcClernand was on Sherman's left, with troops that had been engaged at\r\nforts Henry and Donelson and were therefore veterans so far as western\r\ntroops had become such at that stage of the war.  Next to McClernand\r\ncame Prentiss with a raw division, and on the extreme left, Stuart with\r\none brigade of Sherman's division.  Hurlbut was in rear of Prentiss,\r\nmassed, and in reserve at the time of the onset.  The division of\r\nGeneral C. F. Smith was on the right, also in reserve.  General Smith\r\nwas still sick in bed at Savannah, but within hearing of our guns.  His\r\nservices would no doubt have been of inestimable value had his health\r\npermitted his presence.  The command of his division devolved upon\r\nBrigadier-General W. H. L. Wallace, a most estimable and able officer; a\r\nveteran too, for he had served a year in the Mexican war and had been\r\nwith his command at Henry and Donelson.  Wallace was mortally wounded in\r\nthe first day's engagement, and with the change of commanders thus\r\nnecessarily effected in the heat of battle the efficiency of his\r\ndivision was much weakened.\r\n\r\nThe position of our troops made a continuous line from Lick Creek on the\r\nleft to Owl Creek, a branch of Snake Creek, on the right, facing nearly\r\nsouth and possibly a little west.  The water in all these streams was\r\nvery high at the time and contributed to protect our flanks.  The enemy\r\nwas compelled, therefore, to attack directly in front.  This he did with\r\ngreat vigor, inflicting heavy losses on the National side, but suffering\r\nmuch heavier on his own.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate assaults were made with such a disregard of losses on\r\ntheir own side that our line of tents soon fell into their hands.  The\r\nground on which the battle was fought was undulating, heavily timbered\r\nwith scattered clearings, the woods giving some protection to the troops\r\non both sides.  There was also considerable underbrush.  A number of\r\nattempts were made by the enemy to turn our right flank, where Sherman\r\nwas posted, but every effort was repulsed with heavy loss.  But the\r\nfront attack was kept up so vigorously that, to prevent the success of\r\nthese attempts to get on our flanks, the National troops were compelled,\r\nseveral times, to take positions to the rear nearer Pittsburg landing.\r\nWhen the firing ceased at night the National line was all of a mile in\r\nrear of the position it had occupied in the morning.\r\n\r\nIn one of the backward moves, on the 6th, the division commanded by\r\nGeneral Prentiss did not fall back with the others.  This left his\r\nflanks exposed and enabled the enemy to capture him with about 2,200 of\r\nhis officers and men.  General Badeau gives four o'clock of the 6th as\r\nabout the time this capture took place. He may be right as to the time,\r\nbut my recollection is that the hour was later.  General Prentiss\r\nhimself gave the hour as half-past five.  I was with him, as I was with\r\neach of the division commanders that day, several times, and my\r\nrecollection is that the last time I was with him was about half-past\r\nfour, when his division was standing up firmly and the General was as\r\ncool as if expecting victory.  But no matter whether it was four or\r\nlater, the story that he and his command were surprised and captured in\r\ntheir camps is without any foundation whatever.  If it had been true, as\r\ncurrently reported at the time and yet believed by thousands of people,\r\nthat Prentiss and his division had been captured in their beds, there\r\nwould not have been an all-day struggle, with the loss of thousands\r\nkilled and wounded on the Confederate side.\r\n\r\nWith the single exception of a few minutes after the capture of\r\nPrentiss, a continuous and unbroken line was maintained all day from\r\nSnake Creek or its tributaries on the right to Lick Creek or the\r\nTennessee on the left above Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nThere was no hour during the day when there was not heavy firing and\r\ngenerally hard fighting at some point on the line, but seldom at all\r\npoints at the same time.  It was a case of Southern dash against\r\nNorthern pluck and endurance.  Three of the five divisions engaged on\r\nSunday were entirely raw, and many of the men had only received their\r\narms on the way from their States to the field.  Many of them had\r\narrived but a day or two before and were hardly able to load their\r\nmuskets according to the manual.  Their officers were equally ignorant\r\nof their duties. Under these circumstances it is not astonishing that\r\nmany of the regiments broke at the first fire.  In two cases, as I now\r\nremember, colonels led their regiments from the field on first hearing\r\nthe whistle of the enemy's bullets.  In these cases the colonels were\r\nconstitutional cowards, unfit for any military position; but not so the\r\nofficers and men led out of danger by them.  Better troops never went\r\nupon a battle-field than many of these, officers and men, afterwards\r\nproved themselves to be, who fled panic stricken at the first whistle of\r\nbullets and shell at Shiloh.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of Sunday I was continuously engaged in passing from\r\none part of the field to another, giving directions to division\r\ncommanders.  In thus moving along the line, however, I never deemed it\r\nimportant to stay long with Sherman.  Although his troops were then\r\nunder fire for the first time, their commander, by his constant presence\r\nwith them, inspired a confidence in officers and men that enabled them\r\nto render services on that bloody battle-field worthy of the best of\r\nveterans.  McClernand was next to Sherman, and the hardest fighting was\r\nin front of these two divisions.  McClernand told me on that day, the\r\n6th, that he profited much by having so able a commander supporting him.\r\nA casualty to Sherman that would have taken him from the field that day\r\nwould have been a sad one for the troops engaged at Shiloh.  And how\r\nnear we came to this! On the 6th Sherman was shot twice, once in the\r\nhand, once in the shoulder, the ball cutting his coat and making a\r\nslight wound, and a third ball passed through his hat.  In addition to\r\nthis he had several horses shot during the day.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this battle was such that cavalry could not be used in\r\nfront; I therefore formed ours into line in rear, to stop stragglers--of\r\nwhom there were many.  When there would be enough of them to make a\r\nshow, and after they had recovered from their fright, they would be sent\r\nto reinforce some part of the line which needed support, without regard\r\nto their companies, regiments or brigades.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion during the day I rode back as far as the river and met\r\nGeneral Buell, who had just arrived; I do not remember the hour, but at\r\nthat time there probably were as many as four or five thousand\r\nstragglers lying under cover of the river bluff, panic-stricken, most of\r\nwhom would have been shot where they lay, without resistance, before\r\nthey would have taken muskets and marched to the front to protect\r\nthemselves.  This meeting between General Buell and myself was on the\r\ndispatch-boat used to run between the landing and Savannah.  It was\r\nbrief, and related specially to his getting his troops over the river.\r\nAs we left the boat together, Buell's attention was attracted by the men\r\nlying under cover of the river bank.  I saw him berating them and trying\r\nto shame them into joining their regiments.  He even threatened them\r\nwith shells from the gunboats near by.  But it was all to no effect.\r\nMost of these men afterward proved themselves as gallant as any of those\r\nwho saved the battle from which they had deserted.  I have no doubt that\r\nthis sight impressed General Buell with the idea that a line of retreat\r\nwould be a good thing just then.  If he had come in by the front instead\r\nof through the stragglers in the rear, he would have thought and felt\r\ndifferently.  Could he have come through the Confederate rear, he would\r\nhave witnessed there a scene similar to that at our own.  The distant\r\nrear of an army engaged in battle is not the best place from which to\r\njudge correctly what is going on in front.  Later in the war, while\r\noccupying the country between the Tennessee and the Mississippi, I\r\nlearned that the panic in the Confederate lines had not differed much\r\nfrom that within our own.  Some of the country people estimated the\r\nstragglers from Johnston's army as high as 20,000.  Of course this was\r\nan exaggeration.\r\n\r\nThe situation at the close of Sunday was as follows:  along the top of\r\nthe bluff just south of the log-house which stood at Pittsburg landing,\r\nColonel J. D. Webster, of my staff, had arranged twenty or more pieces\r\nof artillery facing south or up the river.  This line of artillery was\r\non the crest of a hill overlooking a deep ravine opening into the\r\nTennessee.  Hurlbut with his division intact was on the right of this\r\nartillery, extending west and possibly a little north.  McClernand came\r\nnext in the general line, looking more to the west.  His division was\r\ncomplete in its organization and ready for any duty.  Sherman came next,\r\nhis right extending to Snake Creek. His command, like the other two, was\r\ncomplete in its organization and ready, like its chief, for any service\r\nit might be called upon to render.  All three divisions were, as a\r\nmatter of course, more or less shattered and depleted in numbers from\r\nthe terrible battle of the day.  The division of W. H. L. Wallace, as\r\nmuch from the disorder arising from changes of division and brigade\r\ncommanders, under heavy fire, as from any other cause, had lost its\r\norganization and did not occupy a place in the line as a division.\r\nPrentiss' command was gone as a division, many of its members having\r\nbeen killed, wounded or captured, but it had rendered valiant services\r\nbefore its final dispersal, and had contributed a good share to the\r\ndefence of Shiloh.\r\n\r\nThe right of my line rested near the bank of Snake Creek, a short\r\ndistance above the bridge which had been built by the troops for the\r\npurpose of connecting Crump's landing and Pittsburg landing.  Sherman\r\nhad posted some troops in a log-house and out-buildings which overlooked\r\nboth the bridge over which Wallace was expected and the creek above that\r\npoint.  In this last position Sherman was frequently attacked before\r\nnight, but held the point until he voluntarily abandoned it to advance\r\nin order to make room for Lew. Wallace, who came up after dark.\r\n\r\nThere was, as I have said, a deep ravine in front of our left. The\r\nTennessee River was very high and there was water to a considerable\r\ndepth in the ravine.  Here the enemy made a last desperate effort to\r\nturn our flank, but was repelled.  The gunboats Tyler and Lexington,\r\nGwin and Shirk commanding, with the artillery under Webster, aided the\r\narmy and effectually checked their further progress.  Before any of\r\nBuell's troops had reached the west bank of the Tennessee, firing had\r\nalmost entirely ceased; anything like an attempt on the part of the\r\nenemy to advance had absolutely ceased.  There was some artillery firing\r\nfrom an unseen enemy, some of his shells passing beyond us; but I do not\r\nremember that there was the whistle of a single musket-ball heard.  As\r\nhis troops arrived in the dusk General Buell marched several of his\r\nregiments part way down the face of the hill where they fired briskly\r\nfor some minutes, but I do not think a single man engaged in this firing\r\nreceived an injury.  The attack had spent its force.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lew. Wallace, with 5,000 effective men, arrived after firing had\r\nceased for the day, and was placed on the right. Thus night came,\r\nWallace came, and the advance of Nelson's division came; but none\r\n--unless night--in time to be of material service to the gallant men who\r\nsaved Shiloh on that first day against large odds.  Buell's loss on the\r\n6th of April was two men killed and one wounded, all members of the 36th\r\nIndiana infantry.  The Army of the Tennessee lost on that day at least\r\n7,000 men.  The presence of two or three regiments of Buell's army on\r\nthe west bank before firing ceased had not the slightest effect in\r\npreventing the capture of Pittsburg landing.\r\n\r\nSo confident was I before firing had ceased on the 6th that the next day\r\nwould bring victory to our arms if we could only take the initiative,\r\nthat I visited each division commander in person before any\r\nreinforcements had reached the field.  I directed them to throw out\r\nheavy lines of skirmishers in the morning as soon as they could see, and\r\npush them forward until they found the enemy, following with their\r\nentire divisions in supporting distance, and to engage the enemy as soon\r\nas found.  To Sherman I told the story of the assault at Fort Donelson,\r\nand said that the same tactics would win at Shiloh.  Victory was assured\r\nwhen Wallace arrived, even if there had been no other support.  I was\r\nglad, however, to see the reinforcements of Buell and credit them with\r\ndoing all there was for them to do.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 6th the remainder of Nelson's division, Buell's\r\narmy crossed the river and were ready to advance in the morning, forming\r\nthe left wing.  Two other divisions, Crittenden's and McCook's, came up\r\nthe river from Savannah in the transports and were on the west bank\r\nearly on the 7th. Buell commanded them in person.  My command was thus\r\nnearly doubled in numbers and efficiency.\r\n\r\nDuring the night rain fell in torrents and our troops were exposed to\r\nthe storm without shelter.  I made my headquarters under a tree a few\r\nhundred yards back from the river bank.  My ankle was so much swollen\r\nfrom the fall of my horse the Friday night preceding, and the bruise was\r\nso painful, that I could get no rest.\r\n\r\nThe drenching rain would have precluded the possibility of sleep without\r\nthis additional cause.  Some time after midnight, growing restive under\r\nthe storm and the continuous pain, I moved back to the log-house under\r\nthe bank.  This had been taken as a hospital, and all night wounded men\r\nwere being brought in, their wounds dressed, a leg or an arm amputated\r\nas the case might require, and everything being done to save life or\r\nalleviate suffering.  The sight was more unendurable than encountering\r\nthe enemy's fire, and I returned to my tree in the rain.\r\n\r\nThe advance on the morning of the 7th developed the enemy in the camps\r\noccupied by our troops before the battle began, more than a mile back\r\nfrom the most advanced position of the Confederates on the day before.\r\nIt is known now that they had not yet learned of the arrival of Buell's\r\ncommand.  Possibly they fell back so far to get the shelter of our tents\r\nduring the rain, and also to get away from the shells that were dropped\r\nupon them by the gunboats every fifteen minutes during the night.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Union troops on the morning of the 7th was as\r\nfollows:  General Lew. Wallace on the right; Sherman on his left; then\r\nMcClernand and then Hurlbut.  Nelson, of Buell's army, was on our\r\nextreme left, next to the river.\r\n\r\nCrittenden was next in line after Nelson and on his right, McCook\r\nfollowed and formed the extreme right of Buell's command.  My old\r\ncommand thus formed the right wing, while the troops directly under\r\nBuell constituted the left wing of the army.  These relative positions\r\nwere retained during the entire day, or until the enemy was driven from\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time the battle became general all along the line.  This\r\nday everything was favorable to the Union side.  We had now become the\r\nattacking party.  The enemy was driven back all day, as we had been the\r\nday before, until finally he beat a precipitate retreat.  The last point\r\nheld by him was near the road leading from the landing to Corinth, on\r\nthe left of Sherman and right of McClernand.  About three o'clock, being\r\nnear that point and seeing that the enemy was giving way everywhere\r\nelse, I gathered up a couple of regiments, or parts of regiments, from\r\ntroops near by, formed them in line of battle and marched them forward,\r\ngoing in front myself to prevent premature or long-range firing.  At\r\nthis point there was a clearing between us and the enemy favorable for\r\ncharging, although exposed.  I knew the enemy were ready to break and\r\nonly wanted a little encouragement from us to go quickly and join their\r\nfriends who had started earlier.  After marching to within musket-range\r\nI stopped and let the troops pass.  The command, CHARGE, was given, and\r\nwas executed with loud cheers and with a run; when the last of the enemy\r\nbroke. (*7)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nSTRUCK BY A BULLET--PRECIPITATE RETREAT OF THE CONFEDERATES\r\n--INTRENCHMENTS AT SHILOH--GENERAL BUELL--GENERAL JOHNSTON--REMARKS ON\r\nSHILOH.\r\n\r\nDuring this second day of the battle I had been moving from right to\r\nleft and back, to see for myself the progress made.  In the early part\r\nof the afternoon, while riding with Colonel McPherson and Major Hawkins,\r\nthen my chief commissary, we got beyond the left of our troops.  We were\r\nmoving along the northern edge of a clearing, very leisurely, toward the\r\nriver above the landing.  There did not appear to be an enemy to our\r\nright, until suddenly a battery with musketry opened upon us from the\r\nedge of the woods on the other side of the clearing. The shells and\r\nballs whistled about our ears very fast for about a minute.  I do not\r\nthink it took us longer than that to get out of range and out of sight.\r\nIn the sudden start we made, Major Hawkins lost his hat.  He did not\r\nstop to pick it up.  When we arrived at a perfectly safe position we\r\nhalted to take an account of damages.  McPherson's horse was panting as\r\nif ready to drop.  On examination it was found that a ball had struck\r\nhim forward of the flank just back of the saddle, and had gone entirely\r\nthrough.  In a few minutes the poor beast dropped dead; he had given no\r\nsign of injury until we came to a stop.  A ball had struck the metal\r\nscabbard of my sword, just below the hilt, and broken it nearly off;\r\nbefore the battle was over it had broken off entirely.  There were\r\nthree of us:  one had lost a horse, killed; one a hat and one a\r\nsword-scabbard.  All were thankful that it was no worse.\r\n\r\nAfter the rain of the night before and the frequent and heavy rains for\r\nsome days previous, the roads were almost impassable.  The enemy\r\ncarrying his artillery and supply trains over them in his retreat, made\r\nthem still worse for troops following.  I wanted to pursue, but had not\r\nthe heart to order the men who had fought desperately for two days,\r\nlying in the mud and rain whenever not fighting, and I did (*8) not feel\r\ndisposed to positively order Buell, or any part of his command, to\r\npursue.  Although the senior in rank at the time I had been so only a\r\nfew weeks.  Buell was, and had been for some time past, a department\r\ncommander, while I commanded only a district.  I did not meet Buell in\r\nperson until too late to get troops ready and pursue with effect; but\r\nhad I seen him at the moment of the last charge I should have at least\r\nrequested him to follow.\r\n\r\nI rode forward several miles the day after the battle, and found that\r\nthe enemy had dropped much, if not all, of their provisions, some\r\nammunition and the extra wheels of their caissons, lightening their\r\nloads to enable them to get off their guns. About five miles out we\r\nfound their field hospital abandoned. An immediate pursuit must have\r\nresulted in the capture of a considerable number of prisoners and\r\nprobably some guns.\r\n\r\nShiloh was the severest battle fought at the West during the war, and\r\nbut few in the East equalled it for hard, determined fighting.  I saw an\r\nopen field, in our possession on the second day, over which the\r\nConfederates had made repeated charges the day before, so covered with\r\ndead that it would have been possible to walk across the clearing, in\r\nany direction, stepping on dead bodies, without a foot touching the\r\nground.  On our side National and Confederate troops were mingled\r\ntogether in about equal proportions; but on the remainder of the field\r\nnearly all were Confederates.  On one part, which had evidently not been\r\nploughed for several years, probably because the land was poor, bushes\r\nhad grown up, some to the height of eight or ten feet. There was not one\r\nof these left standing unpierced by bullets. The smaller ones were all\r\ncut down.\r\n\r\nContrary to all my experience up to that time, and to the experience of\r\nthe army I was then commanding, we were on the defensive.  We were\r\nwithout intrenchments or defensive advantages of any sort, and more than\r\nhalf the army engaged the first day was without experience or even drill\r\nas soldiers.  The officers with them, except the division commanders and\r\npossibly two or three of the brigade commanders, were equally\r\ninexperienced in war.  The result was a Union victory that gave the men\r\nwho achieved it great confidence in themselves ever after.\r\n\r\nThe enemy fought bravely, but they had started out to defeat and destroy\r\nan army and capture a position.  They failed in both, with very heavy\r\nloss in killed and wounded, and must have gone back discouraged and\r\nconvinced that the \"Yankee\" was not an enemy to be despised.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle I gave verbal instructions to division commanders to\r\nlet the regiments send out parties to bury their own dead, and to detail\r\nparties, under commissioned officers from each division, to bury the\r\nConfederate dead in their respective fronts and to report the numbers so\r\nburied.  The latter part of these instructions was not carried out by\r\nall; but they were by those sent from Sherman's division, and by some of\r\nthe parties sent out by McClernand.  The heaviest loss sustained by the\r\nenemy was in front of these two divisions.\r\n\r\nThe criticism has often been made that the Union troops should have been\r\nintrenched at Shiloh.  Up to that time the pick and spade had been but\r\nlittle resorted to at the West.  I had, however, taken this subject\r\nunder consideration soon after re-assuming command in the field, and, as\r\nalready stated, my only military engineer reported unfavorably.  Besides\r\nthis, the troops with me, officers and men, needed discipline and drill\r\nmore than they did experience with the pick, shovel and axe.\r\nReinforcements were arriving almost daily, composed of troops that had\r\nbeen hastily thrown together into companies and regiments--fragments of\r\nincomplete organizations, the men and officers strangers to each other.\r\nUnder all these circumstances I concluded that drill and discipline were\r\nworth more to our men than fortifications.\r\n\r\nGeneral Buell was a brave, intelligent officer, with as much\r\nprofessional pride and ambition of a commendable sort as I ever knew.  I\r\nhad been two years at West Point with him, and had served with him\r\nafterwards, in garrison and in the Mexican war, several years more.  He\r\nwas not given in early life or in mature years to forming intimate\r\nacquaintances.  He was studious by habit, and commanded the confidence\r\nand respect of all who knew him.  He was a strict disciplinarian, and\r\nperhaps did not distinguish sufficiently between the volunteer who\r\n\"enlisted for the war\" and the soldier who serves in time of peace.  One\r\nsystem embraced men who risked life for a principle, and often men of\r\nsocial standing, competence, or wealth and independence of character.\r\nThe other includes, as a rule, only men who could not do as well in any\r\nother occupation.  General Buell became an object of harsh criticism\r\nlater, some going so far as to challenge his loyalty.  No one who knew\r\nhim ever believed him capable of a dishonorable act, and nothing could\r\nbe more dishonorable than to accept high rank and command in war and\r\nthen betray the trust.  When I came into command of the army in 1864, I\r\nrequested the Secretary of War to restore General Buell to duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, during the summer of 1865, I travelled considerably\r\nthrough the North, and was everywhere met by large numbers of people.\r\nEvery one had his opinion about the manner in which the war had been\r\nconducted:  who among the generals had failed, how, and why.\r\nCorrespondents of the press were ever on hand to hear every word\r\ndropped, and were not always disposed to report correctly what did not\r\nconfirm their preconceived notions, either about the conduct of the war\r\nor the individuals concerned in it.  The opportunity frequently occurred\r\nfor me to defend General Buell against what I believed to be most unjust\r\ncharges.  On one occasion a correspondent put in my mouth the very\r\ncharge I had so often refuted--of disloyalty.  This brought from General\r\nBuell a very severe retort, which I saw in the New York World some time\r\nbefore I received the letter itself.  I could very well understand his\r\ngrievance at seeing untrue and disgraceful charges apparently sustained\r\nby an officer who, at the time, was at the head of the army.  I replied\r\nto him, but not through the press.  I kept no copy of my letter, nor did\r\nI ever see it in print; neither did I receive an answer.\r\n\r\nGeneral Albert Sidney Johnston, who commanded the Confederate forces at\r\nthe beginning of the battle, was disabled by a wound on the afternoon of\r\nthe first day.  This wound, as I understood afterwards, was not\r\nnecessarily fatal, or even dangerous.  But he was a man who would not\r\nabandon what he deemed an important trust in the face of danger and\r\nconsequently continued in the saddle, commanding, until so exhausted by\r\nthe loss of blood that he had to be taken from his horse, and soon after\r\ndied.  The news was not long in reaching our side and I suppose was\r\nquite an encouragement to the National soldiers.\r\n\r\nI had known Johnston slightly in the Mexican war and later as an officer\r\nin the regular army.  He was a man of high character and ability.  His\r\ncontemporaries at West Point, and officers generally who came to know\r\nhim personally later and who remained on our side, expected him to prove\r\nthe most formidable man to meet that the Confederacy would produce.\r\n\r\nI once wrote that nothing occurred in his brief command of an army to\r\nprove or disprove the high estimate that had been placed upon his\r\nmilitary ability; but after studying the orders and dispatches of\r\nJohnston I am compelled to materially modify my views of that officer's\r\nqualifications as a soldier.  My judgment now is that he was vacillating\r\nand undecided in his actions.\r\n\r\nAll the disasters in Kentucky and Tennessee were so discouraging to the\r\nauthorities in Richmond that Jefferson Davis wrote an unofficial letter\r\nto Johnston expressing his own anxiety and that of the public, and\r\nsaying that he had made such defence as was dictated by long friendship,\r\nbut that in the absence of a report he needed facts.  The letter was not\r\na reprimand in direct terms, but it was evidently as much felt as though\r\nit had been one.  General Johnston raised another army as rapidly as he\r\ncould, and fortified or strongly intrenched at Corinth.  He knew the\r\nNational troops were preparing to attack him in his chosen position.\r\nBut he had evidently become so disturbed at the results of his\r\noperations that he resolved to strike out in an offensive campaign which\r\nwould restore all that was lost, and if successful accomplish still\r\nmore.  We have the authority of his son and biographer for saying that\r\nhis plan was to attack the forces at Shiloh and crush them; then to\r\ncross the Tennessee and destroy the army of Buell, and push the war\r\nacross the Ohio River.  The design was a bold one; but we have the same\r\nauthority for saying that in the execution Johnston showed vacillation\r\nand indecision.  He left Corinth on the 2d of April and was not ready to\r\nattack until the 6th.  The distance his army had to march was less than\r\ntwenty miles.  Beauregard, his second in command, was opposed to the\r\nattack for two reasons: first, he thought, if let alone the National\r\ntroops would attack the Confederates in their intrenchments; second, we\r\nwere in ground of our own choosing and would necessarily be intrenched.\r\nJohnston not only listened to the objection of Beauregard to an attack,\r\nbut held a council of war on the subject on the morning of the 5th.  On\r\nthe evening of the same day he was in consultation with some of his\r\ngenerals on the same subject, and still again on the morning of the 6th.\r\nDuring this last consultation, and before a decision had been reached,\r\nthe battle began by the National troops opening fire on the enemy. This\r\nseemed to settle the question as to whether there was to be any battle\r\nof Shiloh.  It also seems to me to settle the question as to whether\r\nthere was a surprise.\r\n\r\nI do not question the personal courage of General Johnston, or his\r\nability.  But he did not win the distinction predicted for him by many\r\nof his friends.  He did prove that as a general he was over-estimated.\r\n\r\nGeneral Beauregard was next in rank to Johnston and succeeded to the\r\ncommand, which he retained to the close of the battle and during the\r\nsubsequent retreat on Corinth, as well as in the siege of that place.\r\nHis tactics have been severely criticised by Confederate writers, but I\r\ndo not believe his fallen chief could have done any better under the\r\ncircumstances.  Some of these critics claim that Shiloh was won when\r\nJohnston fell, and that if he had not fallen the army under me would\r\nhave been annihilated or captured.  IFS defeated the Confederates at\r\nShiloh.  There is little doubt that we would have been disgracefully\r\nbeaten IF all the shells and bullets fired by us had passed harmlessly\r\nover the enemy and IF all of theirs had taken effect.  Commanding\r\ngenerals are liable to be killed during engagements; and the fact that\r\nwhen he was shot Johnston was leading a brigade to induce it to make a\r\ncharge which had been repeatedly ordered, is evidence that there was\r\nneither the universal demoralization on our side nor the unbounded\r\nconfidence on theirs which has been claimed.  There was, in fact, no\r\nhour during the day when I doubted the eventual defeat of the enemy,\r\nalthough I was disappointed that reinforcements so near at hand did not\r\narrive at an earlier hour.\r\n\r\nThe description of the battle of Shiloh given by Colonel Wm. Preston\r\nJohnston is very graphic and well told.  The reader will imagine that he\r\ncan see each blow struck, a demoralized and broken mob of Union\r\nsoldiers, each blow sending the enemy more demoralized than ever towards\r\nthe Tennessee River, which was a little more than two miles away at the\r\nbeginning of the onset. If the reader does not stop to inquire why, with\r\nsuch Confederate success for more than twelve hours of hard fighting,\r\nthe National troops were not all killed, captured or driven into the\r\nriver, he will regard the pen picture as perfect.  But I witnessed the\r\nfight from the National side from eight o'clock in the morning until\r\nnight closed the contest.  I see but little in the description that I\r\ncan recognize.  The Confederate troops fought well and deserve\r\ncommendation enough for their bravery and endurance on the 6th of April,\r\nwithout detracting from their antagonists or claiming anything more than\r\ntheir just dues.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the enemy show that their condition at the end of the\r\nfirst day was deplorable; their losses in killed and wounded had been\r\nvery heavy, and their stragglers had been quite as numerous as on the\r\nNational side, with the difference that those of the enemy left the\r\nfield entirely and were not brought back to their respective commands\r\nfor many days.  On the Union side but few of the stragglers fell back\r\nfurther than the landing on the river, and many of these were in line\r\nfor duty on the second day.  The admissions of the highest Confederate\r\nofficers engaged at Shiloh make the claim of a victory for them absurd.\r\nThe victory was not to either party until the battle was over.  It was\r\nthen a Union victory, in which the Armies of the Tennessee and the Ohio\r\nboth participated.  But the Army of the Tennessee fought the entire\r\nrebel army on the 6th and held it at bay until near night; and night\r\nalone closed the conflict and not the three regiments of Nelson's\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nThe Confederates fought with courage at Shiloh, but the particular skill\r\nclaimed I could not and still cannot see; though there is nothing to\r\ncriticise except the claims put forward for it since.  But the\r\nConfederate claimants for superiority in strategy, superiority in\r\ngeneralship and superiority in dash and prowess are not so unjust to the\r\nUnion troops engaged at Shiloh as are many Northern writers.  The troops\r\non both sides were American, and united they need not fear any foreign\r\nfoe.  It is possible that the Southern man started in with a little more\r\ndash than his Northern brother; but he was correspondingly less\r\nenduring.\r\n\r\nThe endeavor of the enemy on the first day was simply to hurl their men\r\nagainst ours--first at one point, then at another, sometimes at several\r\npoints at once.  This they did with daring and energy, until at night\r\nthe rebel troops were worn out.  Our effort during the same time was to\r\nbe prepared to resist assaults wherever made.  The object of the\r\nConfederates on the second day was to get away with as much of their\r\narmy and material as possible.  Ours then was to drive them from our\r\nfront, and to capture or destroy as great a part as possible of their\r\nmen and material.  We were successful in driving them back, but not so\r\nsuccessful in captures as if farther pursuit could have been made.  As\r\nit was, we captured or recaptured on the second day about as much\r\nartillery as we lost on the first; and, leaving out the one great\r\ncapture of Prentiss, we took more prisoners on Monday than the enemy\r\ngained from us on Sunday.  On the 6th Sherman lost seven pieces of\r\nartillery, McClernand six, Prentiss eight, and Hurlbut two batteries.\r\nOn the 7th Sherman captured seven guns, McClernand three and the Army of\r\nthe Ohio twenty.\r\n\r\nAt Shiloh the effective strength of the Union forces on the morning of\r\nthe 6th was 33,000 men.  Lew. Wallace brought 5,000 more after\r\nnightfall.  Beauregard reported the enemy's strength at 40,955.\r\nAccording to the custom of enumeration in the South, this number\r\nprobably excluded every man enlisted as musician or detailed as guard or\r\nnurse, and all commissioned officers--everybody who did not carry a\r\nmusket or serve a cannon. With us everybody in the field receiving pay\r\nfrom the government is counted.  Excluding the troops who fled,\r\npanic-stricken, before they had fired a shot, there was not a time\r\nduring the 6th when we had more than 25,000 men in line. On the 7th\r\nBuell brought 20,000 more.  Of his remaining two divisions, Thomas's did\r\nnot reach the field during the engagement; Wood's arrived before firing\r\nhad ceased, but not in time to be of much service.\r\n\r\nOur loss in the two days' fight was 1,754 killed, 8,408 wounded and\r\n2,885 missing.  Of these, 2,103 were in the Army of the Ohio.\r\nBeauregard reported a total loss of 10,699, of whom 1,728 were killed,\r\n8,012 wounded and 957 missing.  This estimate must be incorrect.  We\r\nburied, by actual count, more of the enemy's dead in front of the\r\ndivisions of McClernand and Sherman alone than here reported, and 4,000\r\nwas the estimate of the burial parties of the whole field.  Beauregard\r\nreports the Confederate force on the 6th at over 40,000, and their total\r\nloss during the two days at 10,699; and at the same time declares that\r\nhe could put only 20,000 men in battle on the morning of the 7th.\r\n\r\nThe navy gave a hearty support to the army at Shiloh, as indeed it\r\nalways did both before and subsequently when I was in command.  The\r\nnature of the ground was such, however, that on this occasion it could\r\ndo nothing in aid of the troops until sundown on the first day.  The\r\ncountry was broken and heavily timbered, cutting off all view of the\r\nbattle from the river, so that friends would be as much in danger from\r\nfire from the gunboats as the foe.  But about sundown, when the National\r\ntroops were back in their last position, the right of the enemy was near\r\nthe river and exposed to the fire of the two gun-boats, which was\r\ndelivered with vigor and effect.  After nightfall, when firing had\r\nentirely ceased on land, the commander of the fleet informed himself,\r\napproximately, of the position of our troops and suggested the idea of\r\ndropping a shell within the lines of the enemy every fifteen minutes\r\nduring the night.  This was done with effect, as is proved by the\r\nConfederate reports.\r\n\r\nUp to the battle of Shiloh I, as well as thousands of other citizens,\r\nbelieved that the rebellion against the Government would collapse\r\nsuddenly and soon, if a decisive victory could be gained over any of its\r\narmies.  Donelson and Henry were such victories.  An army of more than\r\n21,000 men was captured or destroyed.  Bowling Green, Columbus and\r\nHickman, Kentucky, fell in consequence, and Clarksville and Nashville,\r\nTennessee, the last two with an immense amount of stores, also fell into\r\nour hands.  The Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, from their mouths to\r\nthe head of navigation, were secured.  But when Confederate armies were\r\ncollected which not only attempted to hold a line farther south, from\r\nMemphis to Chattanooga, Knoxville and on to the Atlantic, but assumed\r\nthe offensive and made such a gallant effort to regain what had been\r\nlost, then, indeed, I gave up all idea of saving the Union except by\r\ncomplete conquest.  Up to that time it had been the policy of our army,\r\ncertainly of that portion commanded by me, to protect the property of\r\nthe citizens whose territory was invaded, without regard to their\r\nsentiments, whether Union or Secession.  After this, however, I regarded\r\nit as humane to both sides to protect the persons of those found at\r\ntheir homes, but to consume everything that could be used to support or\r\nsupply armies.  Protection was still continued over such supplies as\r\nwere within lines held by us and which we expected to continue to hold;\r\nbut such supplies within the reach of Confederate armies I regarded as\r\nmuch contraband as arms or ordnance stores.  Their destruction was\r\naccomplished without bloodshed and tended to the same result as the\r\ndestruction of armies.  I continued this policy to the close of the war.\r\nPromiscuous pillaging, however, was discouraged and punished.\r\nInstructions were always given to take provisions and forage under the\r\ndirection of commissioned officers who should give receipts to owners,\r\nif at home, and turn the property over to officers of the quartermaster\r\nor commissary departments to be issued as if furnished from our Northern\r\ndepots.  But much was destroyed without receipts to owners, when it\r\ncould not be brought within our lines and would otherwise have gone to\r\nthe support of secession and rebellion.\r\n\r\nThis policy I believe exercised a material influence in hastening the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Shiloh, or Pittsburg landing, has been perhaps less\r\nunderstood, or, to state the case more accurately, more persistently\r\nmisunderstood, than any other engagement between National and\r\nConfederate troops during the entire rebellion. Correct reports of the\r\nbattle have been published, notably by Sherman, Badeau and, in a speech\r\nbefore a meeting of veterans, by General Prentiss; but all of these\r\nappeared long subsequent to the close of the rebellion and after public\r\nopinion had been most erroneously formed.\r\n\r\nI myself made no report to General Halleck, further than was contained\r\nin a letter, written immediately after the battle informing him that an\r\nengagement had been fought and announcing the result.  A few days\r\nafterwards General Halleck moved his headquarters to Pittsburg landing\r\nand assumed command of the troops in the field.  Although next to him in\r\nrank, and nominally in command of my old district and army, I was\r\nignored as much as if I had been at the most distant point of territory\r\nwithin my jurisdiction; and although I was in command of all the troops\r\nengaged at Shiloh I was not permitted to see one of the reports of\r\nGeneral Buell or his subordinates in that battle, until they were\r\npublished by the War Department long after the event.  For this reason I\r\nnever made a full official report of this engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nHALLECK ASSUMES COMMAND IN THE FIELD--THE ADVANCE UPON CORINTH\r\n--OCCUPATION OF CORINTH--THE ARMY SEPARATED.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck arrived at Pittsburg landing on the 11th of April and\r\nimmediately assumed command in the field.  On the 21st General Pope\r\narrived with an army 30,000 strong, fresh from the capture of Island\r\nNumber Ten in the Mississippi River.  He went into camp at Hamburg\r\nlanding five miles above Pittsburg. Halleck had now three armies:  the\r\nArmy of the Ohio, Buell commanding; the Army of the Mississippi, Pope\r\ncommanding; and the Army of the Tennessee.  His orders divided the\r\ncombined force into the right wing, reserve, centre and left wing.\r\nMajor-General George H. Thomas, who had been in Buell's army, was\r\ntransferred with his division to the Army of the Tennessee and given\r\ncommand of the right wing, composed of all of that army except\r\nMcClernand's and Lew. Wallace's divisions. McClernand was assigned to\r\nthe command of the reserve, composed of his own and Lew. Wallace's\r\ndivisions.  Buell commanded the centre, the Army of the Ohio; and Pope\r\nthe left wing, the Army of the Mississippi.  I was named second in\r\ncommand of the whole, and was also supposed to be in command of the\r\nright wing and reserve.\r\n\r\nOrders were given to all the commanders engaged at Shiloh to send in\r\ntheir reports without delay to department headquarters.  Those from\r\nofficers of the Army of the Tennessee were sent through me; but from the\r\nArmy of the Ohio they were sent by General Buell without passing through\r\nmy hands.  General Halleck ordered me, verbally, to send in my report,\r\nbut I positively declined on the ground that he had received the reports\r\nof a part of the army engaged at Shiloh without their coming through me.\r\nHe admitted that my refusal was justifiable under the circumstances, but\r\nexplained that he had wanted to get the reports off before moving the\r\ncommand, and as fast as a report had come to him he had forwarded it to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nPreparations were at once made upon the arrival of the new commander for\r\nan advance on Corinth.  Owl Creek, on our right, was bridged, and\r\nexpeditions were sent to the north-west and west to ascertain if our\r\nposition was being threatened from those quarters; the roads towards\r\nCorinth were corduroyed and new ones made; lateral roads were also\r\nconstructed, so that in case of necessity troops marching by different\r\nroutes could reinforce each other.  All commanders were cautioned\r\nagainst bringing on an engagement and informed in so many words that it\r\nwould be better to retreat than to fight.  By the 30th of April all\r\npreparations were complete; the country west to the Mobile and Ohio\r\nrailroad had been reconnoitred, as well as the road to Corinth as far as\r\nMonterey twelve miles from Pittsburg. Everywhere small bodies of the\r\nenemy had been encountered, but they were observers and not in force to\r\nfight battles.\r\n\r\nCorinth, Mississippi, lies in a south-westerly direction from Pittsburg\r\nlanding and about nineteen miles away as the bird would fly, but\r\nprobably twenty-two by the nearest wagon-road. It is about four miles\r\nsouth of the line dividing the States of Tennessee and Mississippi, and\r\nat the junction of the Mississippi and Chattanooga railroad with the\r\nMobile and Ohio road which runs from Columbus to Mobile.  From Pittsburg\r\nto Corinth the land is rolling, but at no point reaching an elevation\r\nthat makes high hills to pass over.  In 1862 the greater part of the\r\ncountry was covered with forest with intervening clearings and houses.\r\nUnderbrush was dense in the low grounds along the creeks and ravines,\r\nbut generally not so thick on the high land as to prevent men passing\r\nthrough with ease.  There are two small creeks running from north of the\r\ntown and connecting some four miles south, where they form Bridge Creek\r\nwhich empties into the Tuscumbia River.  Corinth is on the ridge between\r\nthese streams and is a naturally strong defensive position.  The creeks\r\nare insignificant in volume of water, but the stream to the east widens\r\nout in front of the town into a swamp impassable in the presence of an\r\nenemy.  On the crest of the west bank of this stream the enemy was\r\nstrongly intrenched.\r\n\r\nCorinth was a valuable strategic point for the enemy to hold, and\r\nconsequently a valuable one for us to possess ourselves of.  We ought to\r\nhave seized it immediately after the fall of Donelson and Nashville,\r\nwhen it could have been taken without a battle, but failing then it\r\nshould have been taken, without delay on the concentration of troops at\r\nPittsburg landing after the battle of Shiloh.  In fact the arrival of\r\nPope should not have been awaited.  There was no time from the battle of\r\nShiloh up to the evacuation of Corinth when the enemy would not have\r\nleft if pushed.  The demoralization among the Confederates from their\r\ndefeats at Henry and Donelson; their long marches from Bowling Green,\r\nColumbus, and Nashville, and their failure at Shiloh; in fact from\r\nhaving been driven out of Kentucky and Tennessee, was so great that a\r\nstand for the time would have been impossible.  Beauregard made\r\nstrenuous efforts to reinforce himself and partially succeeded.  He\r\nappealed to the people of the South-west for new regiments, and received\r\na few.  A. S. Johnston had made efforts to reinforce in the same\r\nquarter, before the battle of Shiloh, but in a different way.  He had\r\nnegroes sent out to him to take the place of teamsters, company cooks\r\nand laborers in every capacity, so as to put all his white men into the\r\nranks.  The people, while willing to send their sons to the field, were\r\nnot willing to part with their negroes.  It is only fair to state that\r\nthey probably wanted their blacks to raise supplies for the army and for\r\nthe families left at home.\r\n\r\nBeauregard, however, was reinforced by Van Dorn immediately after Shiloh\r\nwith 17,000 men.  Interior points, less exposed, were also depleted to\r\nadd to the strength at Corinth.  With these reinforcements and the new\r\nregiments, Beauregard had, during the month of May, 1862, a large force\r\non paper, but probably not much over 50,000 effective men.  We estimated\r\nhis strength at 70,000.  Our own was, in round numbers, 120,000. The\r\ndefensible nature of the ground at Corinth, and the fortifications, made\r\n50,000 then enough to maintain their position against double that number\r\nfor an indefinite time but for the demoralization spoken of.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April the grand army commenced its advance from Shiloh\r\nupon Corinth.  The movement was a siege from the start to the close.\r\nThe National troops were always behind intrenchments, except of course\r\nthe small reconnoitring parties sent to the front to clear the way for\r\nan advance.  Even the commanders of these parties were cautioned, \"not\r\nto bring on an engagement.\" \"It is better to retreat than to fight.\"\r\nThe enemy were constantly watching our advance, but as they were simply\r\nobservers there were but few engagements that even threatened to become\r\nbattles.  All the engagements fought ought to have served to encourage\r\nthe enemy.  Roads were again made in our front, and again corduroyed; a\r\nline was intrenched, and the troops were advanced to the new position.\r\nCross roads were constructed to these new positions to enable the troops\r\nto concentrate in case of attack.  The National armies were thoroughly\r\nintrenched all the way from the Tennessee River to Corinth.\r\n\r\nFor myself I was little more than an observer.  Orders were sent direct\r\nto the right wing or reserve, ignoring me, and advances were made from\r\none line of intrenchments to another without notifying me.  My position\r\nwas so embarrassing in fact that I made several applications during the\r\nsiege to be relieved.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck kept his headquarters generally, if not all the time,\r\nwith the right wing.  Pope being on the extreme left did not see so much\r\nof his chief, and consequently got loose as it were at times.  On the 3d\r\nof May he was at Seven Mile Creek with the main body of his command, but\r\nthrew forward a division to Farmington, within four miles of Corinth.\r\nHis troops had quite a little engagement at Farmington on that day, but\r\ncarried the place with considerable loss to the enemy.  There would then\r\nhave been no difficulty in advancing the centre and right so as to form\r\na new line well up to the enemy, but Pope was ordered back to conform\r\nwith the general line.  On the 8th of May he moved again, taking his\r\nwhole force to Farmington, and pushed out two divisions close to the\r\nrebel line.  Again he was ordered back.  By the 4th of May the centre\r\nand right wing reached Monterey, twelve miles out.  Their advance was\r\nslow from there, for they intrenched with every forward movement.  The\r\nleft wing moved up again on the 25th of May and intrenched itself close\r\nto the enemy.  The creek with the marsh before described, separated the\r\ntwo lines.  Skirmishers thirty feet apart could have maintained either\r\nline at this point.\r\n\r\nOur centre and right were, at this time, extended so that the right of\r\nthe right wing was probably five miles from Corinth and four from the\r\nworks in their front.  The creek, which was a formidable obstacle for\r\neither side to pass on our left, became a very slight obstacle on our\r\nright.  Here the enemy occupied two positions.  One of them, as much as\r\ntwo miles out from his main line, was on a commanding elevation and\r\ndefended by an intrenched battery with infantry supports.  A heavy wood\r\nintervened between this work and the National forces.  In rear to the\r\nsouth there was a clearing extending a mile or more, and south of this\r\nclearing a log-house which had been loop-holed and was occupied by\r\ninfantry.  Sherman's division carried these two positions with some loss\r\nto himself, but with probably greater to the enemy, on the 28th of May,\r\nand on that day the investment of Corinth was complete, or as complete\r\nas it was ever made. Thomas' right now rested west of the Mobile and\r\nOhio railroad. Pope's left commanded the Memphis and Charleston railroad\r\neast of Corinth.\r\n\r\nSome days before I had suggested to the commanding general that I\r\nthought if he would move the Army of the Mississippi at night, by the\r\nrear of the centre and right, ready to advance at daylight, Pope would\r\nfind no natural obstacle in his front and, I believed, no serious\r\nartificial one.  The ground, or works, occupied by our left could be\r\nheld by a thin picket line, owing to the stream and swamp in front.  To\r\nthe right the troops would have a dry ridge to march over.  I was\r\nsilenced so quickly that I felt that possibly I had suggested an\r\nunmilitary movement.\r\n\r\nLater, probably on the 28th of May, General Logan, whose command was\r\nthen on the Mobile and Ohio railroad, said to me that the enemy had been\r\nevacuating for several days and that if allowed he could go into Corinth\r\nwith his brigade.  Trains of cars were heard coming in and going out of\r\nCorinth constantly.  Some of the men who had been engaged in various\r\ncapacities on railroads before the war claimed that they could tell, by\r\nputting their ears to the rail, not only which way the trains were\r\nmoving but which trains were loaded and which were empty.  They said\r\nloaded trains had been going out for several days and empty ones coming\r\nin.  Subsequent events proved the correctness of their judgment.\r\nBeauregard published his orders for the evacuation of Corinth on the\r\n26th of May and fixed the 29th for the departure of his troops, and on\r\nthe 30th of May General Halleck had his whole army drawn up prepared for\r\nbattle and announced in orders that there was every indication that our\r\nleft was to be attacked that morning.  Corinth had already been\r\nevacuated and the National troops marched on and took possession without\r\nopposition.  Everything had been destroyed or carried away.  The\r\nConfederate commander had instructed his soldiers to cheer on the\r\narrival of every train to create the impression among the Yankees that\r\nreinforcements were arriving.  There was not a sick or wounded man left\r\nby the Confederates, nor stores of any kind. Some ammunition had been\r\nblown up--not removed--but the trophies of war were a few Quaker guns,\r\nlogs of about the diameter of ordinary cannon, mounted on wheels of\r\nwagons and pointed in the most threatening manner towards us.\r\n\r\nThe possession of Corinth by the National troops was of strategic\r\nimportance, but the victory was barren in every other particular.  It\r\nwas nearly bloodless.  It is a question whether the MORALE of the\r\nConfederate troops engaged at Corinth was not improved by the immunity\r\nwith which they were permitted to remove all public property and then\r\nwithdraw themselves.  On our side I know officers and men of the Army of\r\nthe Tennessee--and I presume the same is true of those of the other\r\ncommands--were disappointed at the result.  They could not see how the\r\nmere occupation of places was to close the war while large and effective\r\nrebel armies existed.  They believed that a well-directed attack would\r\nat least have partially destroyed the army defending Corinth.  For\r\nmyself I am satisfied that Corinth could have been captured in a two\r\ndays' campaign commenced promptly on the arrival of reinforcements after\r\nthe battle of Shiloh.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck at once commenced erecting fortifications around Corinth\r\non a scale to indicate that this one point must be held if it took the\r\nwhole National army to do it.  All commanding points two or three miles\r\nto the south, south-east and south-west were strongly fortified.  It was\r\nexpected in case of necessity to connect these forts by rifle-pits.\r\nThey were laid out on a scale that would have required 100,000 men to\r\nfully man them.  It was probably thought that a final battle of the war\r\nwould be fought at that point.  These fortifications were never used.\r\nImmediately after the occupation of Corinth by the National troops,\r\nGeneral Pope was sent in pursuit of the retreating garrison and General\r\nBuell soon followed.  Buell was the senior of the two generals and\r\ncommanded the entire column.  The pursuit was kept up for some thirty\r\nmiles, but did not result in the capture of any material of war or\r\nprisoners, unless a few stragglers who had fallen behind and were\r\nwilling captives.  On the 10th of June the pursuing column was all back\r\nat Corinth.  The Army of the Tennessee was not engaged in any of these\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThe Confederates were now driven out of West Tennessee, and on the 6th\r\nof June, after a well-contested naval battle, the National forces took\r\npossession of Memphis and held the Mississippi river from its source to\r\nthat point.  The railroad from Columbus to Corinth was at once put in\r\ngood condition and held by us.  We had garrisons at Donelson,\r\nClarksville and Nashville, on the Cumberland River, and held the\r\nTennessee River from its mouth to Eastport.  New Orleans and Baton Rouge\r\nhad fallen into the possession of the National forces, so that now the\r\nConfederates at the west were narrowed down for all communication with\r\nRichmond to the single line of road running east from Vicksburg.  To\r\ndispossess them of this, therefore, became a matter of the first\r\nimportance.  The possession of the Mississippi by us from Memphis to\r\nBaton Rouge was also a most important object.  It would be equal to the\r\namputation of a limb in its weakening effects upon the enemy.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Corinth a movable force of 80,000 men, besides\r\nenough to hold all the territory acquired, could have been set in motion\r\nfor the accomplishment of any great campaign for the suppression of the\r\nrebellion.  In addition to this fresh troops were being raised to swell\r\nthe effective force.  But the work of depletion commenced.  Buell with\r\nthe Army of the Ohio was sent east, following the line of the Memphis\r\nand Charleston railroad.  This he was ordered to repair as he advanced\r\n--only to have it destroyed by small guerilla bands or other troops as\r\nsoon as he was out of the way.  If he had been sent directly to\r\nChattanooga as rapidly as he could march, leaving two or three divisions\r\nalong the line of the railroad from Nashville forward, he could have\r\narrived with but little fighting, and would have saved much of the loss\r\nof life which was afterwards incurred in gaining Chattanooga.  Bragg\r\nwould then not have had time to raise an army to contest the possession\r\nof middle and east Tennessee and Kentucky; the battles of Stone River\r\nand Chickamauga would not necessarily have been fought; Burnside would\r\nnot have been besieged in Knoxville without the power of helping himself\r\nor escaping; the battle of Chattanooga would not have been fought.\r\nThese are the negative advantages, if the term negative is applicable,\r\nwhich would probably have resulted from prompt movements after Corinth\r\nfell into the possession of the National forces.  The positive results\r\nmight have been:  a bloodless advance to Atlanta, to Vicksburg, or to\r\nany other desired point south of Corinth in the interior of Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MOVED TO MEMPHIS--ON THE ROAD TO MEMPHIS--ESCAPING JACKSON\r\n--COMPLAINTS AND REQUESTS--HALLECK APPOINTED COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF--RETURN\r\nTO CORINTH--MOVEMENTS OF BRAGG--SURRENDER OF CLARKSVILLE--THE ADVANCE\r\nUPON CHATTANOOGA--SHERIDAN COLONEL OF A MICHIGAN REGIMENT.\r\n\r\nMy position at Corinth, with a nominal command and yet no command,\r\nbecame so unbearable that I asked permission of Halleck to remove my\r\nheadquarters to Memphis.  I had repeatedly asked, between the fall of\r\nDonelson and the evacuation of Corinth, to be relieved from duty under\r\nHalleck; but all my applications were refused until the occupation of\r\nthe town.  I then obtained permission to leave the department, but\r\nGeneral Sherman happened to call on me as I was about starting and urged\r\nme so strongly not to think of going, that I concluded to remain.  My\r\napplication to be permitted to remove my headquarters to Memphis was,\r\nhowever, approved, and on the 21st of June I started for that point with\r\nmy staff and a cavalry escort of only a part of one company.  There was\r\na detachment of two or three companies going some twenty-five miles west\r\nto be stationed as a guard to the railroad.  I went under cover of this\r\nescort to the end of their march, and the next morning proceeded to La\r\nGrange with no convoy but the few cavalry men I had with me.\r\n\r\nFrom La Grange to Memphis the distance is forty-seven miles. There were\r\nno troops stationed between these two points, except a small force\r\nguarding a working party which was engaged in repairing the railroad.\r\nNot knowing where this party would be found I halted at La Grange.\r\nGeneral Hurlbut was in command there at the time and had his\r\nheadquarters tents pitched on the lawn of a very commodious country\r\nhouse.  The proprietor was at home and, learning of my arrival, he\r\ninvited General Hurlbut and me to dine with him.  I accepted the\r\ninvitation and spent a very pleasant afternoon with my host, who was a\r\nthorough Southern gentleman fully convinced of the justice of secession.\r\nAfter dinner, seated in the capacious porch, he entertained me with a\r\nrecital of the services he was rendering the cause.  He was too old to\r\nbe in the ranks himself--he must have been quite seventy then--but his\r\nmeans enabled him to be useful in other ways.  In ordinary times the\r\nhomestead where he was now living produced the bread and meat to supply\r\nthe slaves on his main plantation, in the low-lands of Mississippi.  Now\r\nhe raised food and forage on both places, and thought he would have that\r\nyear a surplus sufficient to feed three hundred families of poor men who\r\nhad gone into the war and left their families dependent upon the\r\n\"patriotism\" of those better off.  The crops around me looked fine, and\r\nI had at the moment an idea that about the time they were ready to be\r\ngathered the \"Yankee\" troops would be in the neighborhood and harvest\r\nthem for the benefit of those engaged in the suppression of the\r\nrebellion instead of its support.  I felt, however, the greatest respect\r\nfor the candor of my host and for his zeal in a cause he thoroughly\r\nbelieved in, though our views were as wide apart as it is possible to\r\nconceive.\r\n\r\nThe 23d of June, 1862, on the road from La Grange to Memphis was very\r\nwarm, even for that latitude and season.  With my staff and small escort\r\nI started at an early hour, and before noon we arrived within twenty\r\nmiles of Memphis.  At this point I saw a very comfortable-looking\r\nwhite-haired gentleman seated at the front of his house, a little\r\ndistance from the road.  I let my staff and escort ride ahead while I\r\nhalted and, for an excuse, asked for a glass of water.  I was invited at\r\nonce to dismount and come in.  I found my host very genial and\r\ncommunicative, and staid longer than I had intended, until the lady of\r\nthe house announced dinner and asked me to join them.  The host,\r\nhowever, was not pressing, so that I declined the invitation and,\r\nmounting my horse, rode on.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile west from where I had been stopping a road comes up from\r\nthe southeast, joining that from La Grange to Memphis.  A mile west of\r\nthis junction I found my staff and escort halted and enjoying the shade\r\nof forest trees on the lawn of a house located several hundred feet back\r\nfrom the road, their horses hitched to the fence along the line of the\r\nroad.  I, too, stopped and we remained there until the cool of the\r\nafternoon, and then rode into Memphis.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman with whom I had stopped twenty miles from Memphis was a\r\nMr. De Loche, a man loyal to the Union.  He had not pressed me to tarry\r\nlonger with him because in the early part of my visit a neighbor, a Dr.\r\nSmith, had called and, on being presented to me, backed off the porch as\r\nif something had hit him.  Mr. De Loche knew that the rebel General\r\nJackson was in that neighborhood with a detachment of cavalry.  His\r\nneighbor was as earnest in the southern cause as was Mr. De Loche in\r\nthat of the Union.  The exact location of Jackson was entirely unknown\r\nto Mr. De Loche; but he was sure that his neighbor would know it and\r\nwould give information of my presence, and this made my stay unpleasant\r\nto him after the call of Dr. Smith.\r\n\r\nI have stated that a detachment of troops was engaged in guarding\r\nworkmen who were repairing the railroad east of Memphis.  On the day I\r\nentered Memphis, Jackson captured a small herd of beef cattle which had\r\nbeen sent east for the troops so engaged.  The drovers were not enlisted\r\nmen and he released them.  A day or two after one of these drovers came\r\nto my headquarters and, relating the circumstances of his capture, said\r\nJackson was very much disappointed that he had not captured me; that he\r\nwas six or seven miles south of the Memphis and Charleston railroad when\r\nhe learned that I was stopping at the house of Mr. De Loche, and had\r\nridden with his command to the junction of the road he was on with that\r\nfrom La Grange and Memphis, where he learned that I had passed\r\nthree-quarters of an hour before.  He thought it would be useless to\r\npursue with jaded horses a well-mounted party with so much of a start.\r\nHad he gone three-quarters of a mile farther he would have found me with\r\nmy party quietly resting under the shade of trees and without even arms\r\nin our hands with which to defend ourselves.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson of course did not communicate his disappointment at not\r\ncapturing me to a prisoner, a young drover; but from the talk among the\r\nsoldiers the facts related were learned.  A day or two later Mr. De\r\nLoche called on me in Memphis to apologize for his apparent incivility\r\nin not insisting on my staying for dinner.  He said that his wife\r\naccused him of marked discourtesy, but that, after the call of his\r\nneighbor, he had felt restless until I got away.  I never met General\r\nJackson before the war, nor during it, but have met him since at his\r\nvery comfortable summer home at Manitou Springs, Colorado.  I reminded\r\nhim of the above incident, and this drew from him the response that he\r\nwas thankful now he had not captured me.  I certainly was very thankful\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nMy occupation of Memphis as district headquarters did not last long.\r\nThe period, however, was marked by a few incidents which were novel to\r\nme.  Up to that time I had not occupied any place in the South where the\r\ncitizens were at home in any great numbers.  Dover was within the\r\nfortifications at Fort Donelson, and, as far as I remember, every\r\ncitizen was gone.  There were no people living at Pittsburg landing, and\r\nbut very few at Corinth.  Memphis, however, was a populous city, and\r\nthere were many of the citizens remaining there who were not only\r\nthoroughly impressed with the justice of their cause, but who thought\r\nthat even the \"Yankee soldiery\" must entertain the same views if they\r\ncould only be induced to make an honest confession.  It took hours of my\r\ntime every day to listen to complaints and requests.  The latter were\r\ngenerally reasonable, and if so they were granted; but the complaints\r\nwere not always, or even often, well founded.  Two instances will mark\r\nthe general character.  First:  the officer who commanded at Memphis\r\nimmediately after the city fell into the hands of the National troops\r\nhad ordered one of the churches of the city to be opened to the\r\nsoldiers.  Army chaplains were authorized to occupy the pulpit.  Second:\r\nat the beginning of the war the Confederate Congress had passed a law\r\nconfiscating all property of \"alien enemies\" at the South, including the\r\ndebts of Southerners to Northern men.  In consequence of this law, when\r\nMemphis was occupied the provost-marshal had forcibly collected all the\r\nevidences he could obtain of such debts.\r\n\r\nAlmost the first complaints made to me were these two outrages.  The\r\ngentleman who made the complaints informed me first of his own high\r\nstanding as a lawyer, a citizen and a Christian.  He was a deacon in the\r\nchurch which had been defiled by the occupation of Union troops, and by\r\na Union chaplain filling the pulpit.  He did not use the word \"defile,\"\r\nbut he expressed the idea very clearly.  He asked that the church be\r\nrestored to the former congregation.  I told him that no order had been\r\nissued prohibiting the congregation attending the church.  He said of\r\ncourse the congregation could not hear a Northern clergyman who differed\r\nso radically with them on questions of government.  I told him the\r\ntroops would continue to occupy that church for the present, and that\r\nthey would not be called upon to hear disloyal sentiments proclaimed\r\nfrom the pulpit.  This closed the argument on the first point.\r\n\r\nThen came the second.  The complainant said that he wanted the papers\r\nrestored to him which had been surrendered to the provost-marshal under\r\nprotest; he was a lawyer, and before the establishment of the\r\n\"Confederate States Government\" had been the attorney for a number of\r\nlarge business houses at the North; that \"his government\" had\r\nconfiscated all debts due \"alien enemies,\" and appointed commissioners,\r\nor officers, to collect such debts and pay them over to the\r\n\"government\":  but in his case, owing to his high standing, he had been\r\npermitted to hold these claims for collection, the responsible officials\r\nknowing that he would account to the \"government\" for every dollar\r\nreceived. He said that his \"government,\" when it came in possession of\r\nall its territory, would hold him personally responsible for the claims\r\nhe had surrendered to the provost-marshal.  His impudence was so sublime\r\nthat I was rather amused than indignant.  I told him, however, that if\r\nhe would remain in Memphis I did not believe the Confederate government\r\nwould ever molest him.  He left, no doubt, as much amazed at my\r\nassurance as I was at the brazenness of his request.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of July General Halleck received telegraphic orders\r\nappointing him to the command of all the armies, with headquarters in\r\nWashington.  His instructions pressed him to proceed to his new field of\r\nduty with as little delay as was consistent with the safety and\r\ninterests of his previous command.  I was next in rank, and he\r\ntelegraphed me the same day to report at department headquarters at\r\nCorinth.  I was not informed by the dispatch that my chief had been\r\nordered to a different field and did not know whether to move my\r\nheadquarters or not.  I telegraphed asking if I was to take my staff\r\nwith me, and received word in reply:  \"This place will be your\r\nheadquarters.  You can judge for yourself.\"  I left Memphis for my new\r\nfield without delay, and reached Corinth on the 15th of the month.\r\nGeneral Halleck remained until the 17th of July; but he was very\r\nuncommunicative, and gave me no information as to what I had been called\r\nto Corinth for.\r\n\r\nWhen General Halleck left to assume the duties of general-in-chief I\r\nremained in command of the district of West Tennessee.  Practically I\r\nbecame a department commander, because no one was assigned to that\r\nposition over me and I made my reports direct to the general-in-chief;\r\nbut I was not assigned to the position of department commander until the\r\n25th of October.  General Halleck while commanding the Department of the\r\nMississippi had had control as far east as a line drawn from Chattanooga\r\nnorth.  My district only embraced West Tennessee and Kentucky west of\r\nthe Cumberland River.  Buell, with the Army of the Ohio, had, as\r\npreviously stated, been ordered east towards Chattanooga, with\r\ninstructions to repair the Memphis and Charleston railroad as he\r\nadvanced.  Troops had been sent north by Halleck along the line of the\r\nMobile and Ohio railroad to put it in repair as far as Columbus.  Other\r\ntroops were stationed on the railroad from Jackson, Tennessee, to Grand\r\nJunction, and still others on the road west to Memphis.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the magnificent army of 120,000 men which entered\r\nCorinth on the 30th of May had now become so scattered that I was put\r\nentirely on the defensive in a territory whose population was hostile to\r\nthe Union.  One of the first things I had to do was to construct\r\nfortifications at Corinth better suited to the garrison that could be\r\nspared to man them.  The structures that had been built during the\r\nmonths of May and June were left as monuments to the skill of the\r\nengineer, and others were constructed in a few days, plainer in design\r\nbut suited to the command available to defend them.\r\n\r\nI disposed the troops belonging to the district in conformity with the\r\nsituation as rapidly as possible.  The forces at Donelson, Clarksville\r\nand Nashville, with those at Corinth and along the railroad eastward, I\r\nregarded as sufficient for protection against any attack from the west.\r\nThe Mobile and Ohio railroad was guarded from Rienzi, south of Corinth,\r\nto Columbus; and the Mississippi Central railroad from Jackson,\r\nTennessee, to Bolivar.  Grand Junction and La Grange on the Memphis\r\nrailroad were abandoned.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Army of the Tennessee, and confronting it, was Van Dorn,\r\nwith a sufficient force to organize a movable army of thirty-five to\r\nforty thousand men, after being reinforced by Price from Missouri.  This\r\nmovable force could be thrown against either Corinth, Bolivar or\r\nMemphis; and the best that could be done in such event would be to\r\nweaken the points not threatened in order to reinforce the one that was.\r\nNothing could be gained on the National side by attacking elsewhere,\r\nbecause the territory already occupied was as much as the force present\r\ncould guard.  The most anxious period of the war, to me, was during the\r\ntime the Army of the Tennessee was guarding the territory acquired by\r\nthe fall of Corinth and Memphis and before I was sufficiently reinforced\r\nto take the offensive.  The enemy also had cavalry operating in our\r\nrear, making it necessary to guard every point of the railroad back to\r\nColumbus, on the security of which we were dependent for all our\r\nsupplies. Headquarters were connected by telegraph with all points of\r\nthe command except Memphis and the Mississippi below Columbus.  With\r\nthese points communication was had by the railroad to Columbus, then\r\ndown the river by boat.  To reinforce Memphis would take three or four\r\ndays, and to get an order there for troops to move elsewhere would have\r\ntaken at least two days.  Memphis therefore was practically isolated\r\nfrom the balance of the command.  But it was in Sherman's hands.  Then\r\ntoo the troops were well intrenched and the gunboats made a valuable\r\nauxiliary.\r\n\r\nDuring the two months after the departure of General Halleck there was\r\nmuch fighting between small bodies of the contending armies, but these\r\nencounters were dwarfed by the magnitude of the main battles so as to be\r\nnow almost forgotten except by those engaged in them.  Some of them,\r\nhowever, estimated by the losses on both sides in killed and wounded,\r\nwere equal in hard fighting to most of the battles of the Mexican war\r\nwhich attracted so much of the attention of the public when they\r\noccurred.  About the 23d of July Colonel Ross, commanding at Bolivar,\r\nwas threatened by a large force of the enemy so that he had to be\r\nreinforced from Jackson and Corinth.  On the 27th there was skirmishing\r\non the Hatchie River, eight miles from Bolivar. On the 30th I learned\r\nfrom Colonel P. H. Sheridan, who had been far to the south, that Bragg\r\nin person was at Rome, Georgia, with his troops moving by rail (by way\r\nof Mobile) to Chattanooga and his wagon train marching overland to join\r\nhim at Rome.  Price was at this time at Holly Springs, Mississippi, with\r\na large force, and occupied Grand Junction as an outpost.  I proposed to\r\nthe general-in-chief to be permitted to drive him away, but was informed\r\nthat, while I had to judge for myself, the best use to make of my troops\r\nWAS NOT TO SCATTER THEM, but hold them ready to reinforce Buell.\r\n\r\nThe movement of Bragg himself with his wagon trains to Chattanooga\r\nacross country, while his troops were transported over a long\r\nround-about road to the same destination, without need of guards except\r\nwhen in my immediate front, demonstrates the advantage which troops\r\nenjoy while acting in a country where the people are friendly.  Buell\r\nwas marching through a hostile region and had to have his communications\r\nthoroughly guarded back to a base of supplies.  More men were required\r\nthe farther the National troops penetrated into the enemy's country.  I,\r\nwith an army sufficiently powerful to have destroyed Bragg, was purely\r\non the defensive and accomplishing no more than to hold a force far\r\ninferior to my own.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of August I was ordered from Washington to live upon the\r\ncountry, on the resources of citizens hostile to the government, so far\r\nas practicable.  I was also directed to \"handle rebels within our lines\r\nwithout gloves,\" to imprison them, or to expel them from their homes and\r\nfrom our lines.  I do not recollect having arrested and confined a\r\ncitizen (not a soldier) during the entire rebellion.  I am aware that a\r\ngreat many were sent to northern prisons, particularly to Joliet,\r\nIllinois, by some of my subordinates with the statement that it was my\r\norder.  I had all such released the moment I learned of their arrest;\r\nand finally sent a staff officer north to release every prisoner who was\r\nsaid to be confined by my order.  There were many citizens at home who\r\ndeserved punishment because they were soldiers when an opportunity was\r\nafforded to inflict an injury to the National cause.  This class was not\r\nof the kind that were apt to get arrested, and I deemed it better that a\r\nfew guilty men should escape than that a great many innocent ones should\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of August I was ordered to send two more divisions to Buell.\r\nThey were sent the same day by way of Decatur.  On the 22d Colonel\r\nRodney Mason surrendered Clarksville with six companies of his regiment.\r\n\r\nColonel Mason was one of the officers who had led their regiments off\r\nthe field at almost the first fire of the rebels at Shiloh.  He was by\r\nnature and education a gentleman, and was terribly mortified at his\r\naction when the battle was over.  He came to me with tears in his eyes\r\nand begged to be allowed to have another trial.  I felt great sympathy\r\nfor him and sent him, with his regiment, to garrison Clarksville and\r\nDonelson.  He selected Clarksville for his headquarters, no doubt\r\nbecause he regarded it as the post of danger, it being nearer the enemy.\r\nBut when he was summoned to surrender by a band of guerillas, his\r\nconstitutional weakness overcame him.  He inquired the number of men the\r\nenemy had, and receiving a response indicating a force greater than his\r\nown he said if he could be satisfied of that fact he would surrender.\r\nArrangements were made for him to count the guerillas, and having\r\nsatisfied himself that the enemy had the greater force he surrendered\r\nand informed his subordinate at Donelson of the fact, advising him to do\r\nthe same.  The guerillas paroled their prisoners and moved upon\r\nDonelson, but the officer in command at that point marched out to meet\r\nthem and drove them away.\r\n\r\nAmong other embarrassments, at the time of which I now write, was the\r\nfact that the government wanted to get out all the cotton possible from\r\nthe South and directed me to give every facility toward that end.  Pay\r\nin gold was authorized, and stations on the Mississippi River and on the\r\nrailroad in our possession had to be designated where cotton would be\r\nreceived.  This opened to the enemy not only the means of converting\r\ncotton into money, which had a value all over the world and which they\r\nso much needed, but it afforded them means of obtaining accurate and\r\nintelligent information in regard to our position and strength.  It was\r\nalso demoralizing to the troops.  Citizens obtaining permits from the\r\ntreasury department had to be protected within our lines and given\r\nfacilities to get out cotton by which they realized enormous profits.\r\nMen who had enlisted to fight the battles of their country did not like\r\nto be engaged in protecting a traffic which went to the support of an\r\nenemy they had to fight, and the profits of which went to men who shared\r\nnone of their dangers.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of August Colonel M. D. Leggett, near Bolivar, with the 20th\r\nand 29th Ohio volunteer infantry, was attacked by a force supposed to be\r\nabout 4,000 strong.  The enemy was driven away with a loss of more than\r\none hundred men.  On the 1st of September the bridge guard at Medon was\r\nattacked by guerillas. The guard held the position until reinforced,\r\nwhen the enemy were routed leaving about fifty of their number on the\r\nfield dead or wounded, our loss being only two killed and fifteen\r\nwounded.  On the same day Colonel Dennis, with a force of less than 500\r\ninfantry and two pieces of artillery, met the cavalry of the enemy in\r\nstrong force, a few miles west of Medon, and drove them away with great\r\nloss.  Our troops buried 179 of the enemy's dead, left upon the field.\r\nAfterwards it was found that all the houses in the vicinity of the\r\nbattlefield were turned into hospitals for the wounded.  Our loss, as\r\nreported at the time, was forty-five killed and wounded.  On the 2d of\r\nSeptember I was ordered to send more reinforcements to Buell.  Jackson\r\nand Bolivar were yet threatened, but I sent the reinforcements.  On the\r\n4th I received direct orders to send Granger's division also to\r\nLouisville, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nGeneral Buell had left Corinth about the 10th of June to march upon\r\nChattanooga; Bragg, who had superseded Beauregard in command, sent one\r\ndivision from Tupelo on the 27th of June for the same place.  This gave\r\nBuell about seventeen days' start. If he had not been required to repair\r\nthe railroad as he advanced, the march could have been made in eighteen\r\ndays at the outside, and Chattanooga must have been reached by the\r\nNational forces before the rebels could have possibly got there.  The\r\nroad between Nashville and Chattanooga could easily have been put in\r\nrepair by other troops, so that communication with the North would have\r\nbeen opened in a short time after the occupation of the place by the\r\nNational troops.  If Buell had been permitted to move in the first\r\ninstance, with the whole of the Army of the Ohio and that portion of the\r\nArmy of the Mississippi afterwards sent to him, he could have thrown\r\nfour divisions from his own command along the line of road to repair and\r\nguard it.\r\n\r\nGranger's division was promptly sent on the 4th of September.  I was at\r\nthe station at Corinth when the troops reached that point, and found\r\nGeneral P. H. Sheridan with them.  I expressed surprise at seeing him\r\nand said that I had not expected him to go.  He showed decided\r\ndisappointment at the prospect of being detained.  I felt a little\r\nnettled at his desire to get away and did not detain him.\r\n\r\nSheridan was a first lieutenant in the regiment in which I had served\r\neleven years, the 4th infantry, and stationed on the Pacific coast when\r\nthe war broke out.  He was promoted to a captaincy in May, 1861, and\r\nbefore the close of the year managed in some way, I do not know how, to\r\nget East.  He went to Missouri.  Halleck had known him as a very\r\nsuccessful young officer in managing campaigns against the Indians on\r\nthe Pacific coast, and appointed him acting-quartermaster in south-west\r\nMissouri.  There was no difficulty in getting supplies forward while\r\nSheridan served in that capacity; but he got into difficulty with his\r\nimmediate superiors because of his stringent rules for preventing the\r\nuse of public transportation for private purposes.  He asked to be\r\nrelieved from further duty in the capacity in which he was engaged and\r\nhis request was granted. When General Halleck took the field in April,\r\n1862, Sheridan was assigned to duty on his staff.  During the advance on\r\nCorinth a vacancy occurred in the colonelcy of the 2d Michigan cavalry.\r\nGovernor Blair, of Michigan, telegraphed General Halleck asking him to\r\nsuggest the name of a professional soldier for the vacancy, saying he\r\nwould appoint a good man without reference to his State.  Sheridan was\r\nnamed; and was so conspicuously efficient that when Corinth was reached\r\nhe was assigned to command a cavalry brigade in the Army of the\r\nMississippi.  He was in command at Booneville on the 1st of July with\r\ntwo small regiments, when he was attacked by a force full three times\r\nas numerous as his own.  By very skilful manoeuvres and boldness of\r\nattack he completely routed the enemy.  For this he was made a\r\nbrigadier-general and became a conspicuous figure in the army about\r\nCorinth.  On this account I was sorry to see him leaving me.  His\r\ndeparture was probably fortunate, for he rendered distinguished services\r\nin his new field.\r\n\r\nGranger and Sheridan reached Louisville before Buell got there, and on\r\nthe night of their arrival Sheridan with his command threw up works\r\naround the railroad station for the defence of troops as they came from\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nADVANCE OF VAN DORN AND PRICE--PRICE ENTERS IUKA--BATTLE OF IUKA.\r\n\r\nAt this time, September 4th, I had two divisions of the Army of the\r\nMississippi stationed at Corinth, Rienzi, Jacinto and Danville.  There\r\nwere at Corinth also Davies' division and two brigades of McArthur's,\r\nbesides cavalry and artillery.  This force constituted my left wing, of\r\nwhich Rosecrans was in command.  General Ord commanded the centre, from\r\nBethel to Humboldt on the Mobile and Ohio railroad and from Jackson to\r\nBolivar where the Mississippi Central is crossed by the Hatchie River.\r\nGeneral Sherman commanded on the right at Memphis with two of his\r\nbrigades back at Brownsville, at the crossing of the Hatchie River by\r\nthe Memphis and Ohio railroad.  This made the most convenient\r\narrangement I could devise for concentrating all my spare forces upon\r\nany threatened point.  All the troops of the command were within\r\ntelegraphic communication of each other, except those under Sherman.  By\r\nbringing a portion of his command to Brownsville, from which point there\r\nwas a railroad and telegraph back to Memphis, communication could be had\r\nwith that part of my command within a few hours by the use of couriers.\r\nIn case it became necessary to reinforce Corinth, by this arrangement\r\nall the troops at Bolivar, except a small guard, could be sent by rail\r\nby the way of Jackson in less than twenty-four hours; while the troops\r\nfrom Brownsville could march up to Bolivar to take their place.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of September I learned of the advance of Van Dorn and Price,\r\napparently upon Corinth.  One division was brought from Memphis to\r\nBolivar to meet any emergency that might arise from this move of the\r\nenemy.  I was much concerned because my first duty, after holding the\r\nterritory acquired within my command, was to prevent further reinforcing\r\nof Bragg in Middle Tennessee.  Already the Army of Northern Virginia had\r\ndefeated the army under General Pope and was invading Maryland.  In the\r\nCentre General Buell was on his way to Louisville and Bragg marching\r\nparallel to him with a large Confederate force for the Ohio River.\r\n\r\nI had been constantly called upon to reinforce Buell until at this time\r\nmy entire force numbered less than 50,000 men, of all arms.  This\r\nincluded everything from Cairo south within my jurisdiction.  If I too\r\nshould be driven back, the Ohio River would become the line dividing the\r\nbelligerents west of the Alleghanies, while at the East the line was\r\nalready farther north than when hostilities commenced at the opening of\r\nthe war.  It is true Nashville was never given up after its first\r\ncapture, but it would have been isolated and the garrison there would\r\nhave been obliged to beat a hasty retreat if the troops in West\r\nTennessee had been compelled to fall back.  To say at the end of the\r\nsecond year of the war the line dividing the contestants at the East was\r\npushed north of Maryland, a State that had not seceded, and at the West\r\nbeyond Kentucky, another State which had been always loyal, would have\r\nbeen discouraging indeed.  As it was, many loyal people despaired in the\r\nfall of 1862 of ever saving the Union.  The administration at Washington\r\nwas much concerned for the safety of the cause it held so dear. But I\r\nbelieve there was never a day when the President did not think that, in\r\nsome way or other, a cause so just as ours would come out triumphant.\r\n\r\nUp to the 11th of September Rosecrans still had troops on the railroad\r\neast of Corinth, but they had all been ordered in.  By the 12th all were\r\nin except a small force under Colonel Murphy of the 8th Wisconsin.  He\r\nhad been detained to guard the remainder of the stores which had not yet\r\nbeen brought in to Corinth.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of September General Sterling Price entered Iuka, a town\r\nabout twenty miles east of Corinth on the Memphis and Charleston\r\nrailroad.  Colonel Murphy with a few men was guarding the place.  He\r\nmade no resistance, but evacuated the town on the approach of the enemy.\r\nI was apprehensive lest the object of the rebels might be to get troops\r\ninto Tennessee to reinforce Bragg, as it was afterwards ascertained to\r\nbe.  The authorities at Washington, including the general-in-chief of\r\nthe army, were very anxious, as I have said, about affairs both in East\r\nand Middle Tennessee; and my anxiety was quite as great on their account\r\nas for any danger threatening my command.  I had not force enough at\r\nCorinth to attack Price even by stripping everything; and there was\r\ndanger that before troops could be got from other points he might be far\r\non his way across the Tennessee.  To prevent this all spare forces at\r\nBolivar and Jackson were ordered to Corinth, and cars were concentrated\r\nat Jackson for their transportation.  Within twenty-four hours from the\r\ntransmission of the order the troops were at their destination, although\r\nthere had been a delay of four hours resulting from the forward train\r\ngetting off the track and stopping all the others.  This gave a\r\nreinforcement of near 8,000 men, General Ord in command.  General\r\nRosecrans commanded the district of Corinth with a movable force of\r\nabout 9,000 independent of the garrison deemed necessary to be left\r\nbehind.  It was known that General Van Dorn was about a four days' march\r\nsouth of us, with a large force.  It might have been part of his plan to\r\nattack at Corinth, Price coming from the east while he came up from the\r\nsouth.  My desire was to attack Price before Van Dorn could reach\r\nCorinth or go to his relief.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rosecrans had previously had his headquarters at Iuka, where his\r\ncommand was spread out along the Memphis and Charleston railroad\r\neastward.  While there he had a most excellent map prepared showing all\r\nthe roads and streams in the surrounding country.  He was also\r\npersonally familiar with the ground, so that I deferred very much to him\r\nin my plans for the approach.  We had cars enough to transport all of\r\nGeneral Ord's command, which was to go by rail to Burnsville, a point on\r\nthe road about seven miles west of Iuka.  From there his troops were to\r\nmarch by the north side of the railroad and attack Price from the\r\nnorth-west, while Rosecrans was to move eastward from his position south\r\nof Corinth by way of the Jacinto road.  A small force was to hold the\r\nJacinto road where it turns to the north-east, while the main force\r\nmoved on the Fulton road which comes into Iuka further east.  This plan\r\nwas suggested by Rosecrans.\r\n\r\nBear Creek, a few miles to the east of the Fulton road, is a formidable\r\nobstacle to the movement of troops in the absence of bridges, all of\r\nwhich, in September, 1862, had been destroyed in that vicinity.  The\r\nTennessee, to the north-east, not many miles away, was also a formidable\r\nobstacle for an army followed by a pursuing force.  Ord was on the\r\nnorth-west, and even if a rebel movement had been possible in that\r\ndirection it could have brought only temporary relief, for it would have\r\ncarried Price's army to the rear of the National forces and isolated it\r\nfrom all support.  It looked to me that, if Price would remain in Iuka\r\nuntil we could get there, his annihilation was inevitable.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 18th of September General Ord moved by rail to\r\nBurnsville, and there left the cars and moved out to perform his part of\r\nthe programme.  He was to get as near the enemy as possible during the\r\nday and intrench himself so as to hold his position until the next\r\nmorning.  Rosecrans was to be up by the morning of the 19th on the two\r\nroads before described, and the attack was to be from all three quarters\r\nsimultaneously.  Troops enough were left at Jacinto and Rienzi to detain\r\nany cavalry that Van Dorn might send out to make a sudden dash into\r\nCorinth until I could be notified.  There was a telegraph wire along the\r\nrailroad, so there would be no delay in communication.  I detained cars\r\nand locomotives enough at Burnsville to transport the whole of Ord's\r\ncommand at once, and if Van Dorn had moved against Corinth instead of\r\nIuka I could have thrown in reinforcements to the number of 7,000 or\r\n8,000 before he could have arrived.  I remained at Burnsville with a\r\ndetachment of about 900 men from Ord's command and communicated with my\r\ntwo wings by courier.  Ord met the advance of the enemy soon after\r\nleaving Burnsville.  Quite a sharp engagement ensued, but he drove the\r\nrebels back with considerable loss, including one general officer\r\nkilled.  He maintained his position and was ready to attack by daylight\r\nthe next morning.  I was very much disappointed at receiving a dispatch\r\nfrom Rosecrans after midnight from Jacinto, twenty-two miles from Iuka,\r\nsaying that some of his command had been delayed, and that the rear of\r\nhis column was not yet up as far as Jacinto.  He said, however, that he\r\nwould still be at Iuka by two o'clock the next day.  I did not believe\r\nthis possible because of the distance and the condition of the roads,\r\nwhich was bad; besides, troops after a forced march of twenty miles are\r\nnot in a good condition for fighting the moment they get through.  It\r\nmight do in marching to relieve a beleaguered garrison, but not to make\r\nan assault.  I immediately sent Ord a copy of Rosecrans' dispatch and\r\nordered him to be in readiness to attack the moment he heard the sound\r\nof guns to the south or south-east.  He was instructed to notify his\r\nofficers to be on the alert for any indications of battle. During the\r\n19th the wind blew in the wrong direction to transmit sound either\r\ntowards the point where Ord was, or to Burnsville where I had remained.\r\n\r\nA couple of hours before dark on the 19th Rosecrans arrived with the\r\nhead of his column at Barnets, the point where the Jacinto road to Iuka\r\nleaves the road going east.  He here turned north without sending any\r\ntroops to the Fulton road.  While still moving in column up the Jacinto\r\nroad he met a force of the enemy and had his advance badly beaten and\r\ndriven back upon the main road.  In this short engagement his loss was\r\nconsiderable for the number engaged, and one battery was taken from him.\r\nThe wind was still blowing hard and in the wrong direction to transmit\r\nsounds towards either Ord or me.  Neither he nor I nor any one in either\r\ncommand heard a gun that was fired upon the battle-field.  After the\r\nengagement Rosecrans sent me a dispatch announcing the result.  This was\r\nbrought by a courier.  There was no road between Burnsville and the\r\nposition then occupied by Rosecrans and the country was impassable for a\r\nman on horseback.  The courier bearing the message was compelled to move\r\nwest nearly to Jacinto before he found a road leading to Burnsville.\r\nThis made it a late hour of the night before I learned of the battle\r\nthat had taken place during the afternoon.  I at once notified Ord of\r\nthe fact and ordered him to attack early in the morning.  The next\r\nmorning Rosecrans himself renewed the attack and went into Iuka with but\r\nlittle resistance.  Ord also went in according to orders, without\r\nhearing a gun from the south of town but supposing the troops coming\r\nfrom the south-west must be up by that time.  Rosecrans, however, had\r\nput no troops upon the Fulton road, and the enemy had taken advantage of\r\nthis neglect and retreated by that road during the night.  Word was soon\r\nbrought to me that our troops were in Iuka.  I immediately rode into\r\ntown and found that the enemy was not being pursued even by the cavalry.\r\nI ordered pursuit by the whole of Rosecrans' command and went on with\r\nhim a few miles in person.  He followed only a few miles after I left\r\nhim and then went into camp, and the pursuit was continued no further.\r\nI was disappointed at the result of the battle of Iuka--but I had so\r\nhigh an opinion of General Rosecrans that I found no fault at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nVAN DORN'S MOVEMENTS--BATTLE OF CORINTH--COMMAND OF THE DEPARTMENT OF\r\nTHE TENNESSEE.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of September General Geo. H. Thomas was ordered east to\r\nreinforce Buell.  This threw the army at my command still more on the\r\ndefensive.  The Memphis and Charleston railroad was abandoned, except at\r\nCorinth, and small forces were left at Chewalla and Grand Junction.\r\nSoon afterwards the latter of these two places was given up and Bolivar\r\nbecame our most advanced position on the Mississippi Central railroad.\r\nOur cavalry was kept well to the front and frequent expeditions were\r\nsent out to watch the movements of the enemy.  We were in a country\r\nwhere nearly all the people, except the negroes, were hostile to us and\r\nfriendly to the cause we were trying to suppress.  It was easy,\r\ntherefore, for the enemy to get early information of our every move.\r\nWe, on the contrary, had to go after our information in force, and then\r\noften returned without it.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d Bolivar was threatened by a large force from south of Grand\r\nJunction, supposed to be twenty regiments of infantry with cavalry and\r\nartillery.  I reinforced Bolivar, and went to Jackson in person to\r\nsuperintend the movement of troops to whatever point the attack might be\r\nmade upon.  The troops from Corinth were brought up in time to repel the\r\nthreatened movement without a battle.  Our cavalry followed the enemy\r\nsouth of Davis' mills in Mississippi.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th I found that Van Dorn was apparently endeavoring to strike\r\nthe Mississippi River above Memphis.  At the same time other points\r\nwithin my command were so threatened that it was impossible to\r\nconcentrate a force to drive him away.  There was at this juncture a\r\nlarge Union force at Helena, Arkansas, which, had it been within my\r\ncommand, I could have ordered across the river to attack and break up\r\nthe Mississippi Central railroad far to the south.  This would not only\r\nhave called Van Dorn back, but would have compelled the retention of a\r\nlarge rebel force far to the south to prevent a repetition of such raids\r\non the enemy's line of supplies.  Geographical lines between the\r\ncommands during the rebellion were not always well chosen, or they were\r\ntoo rigidly adhered to.\r\n\r\nVan Dorn did not attempt to get upon the line above Memphis, as had\r\napparently been his intention.  He was simply covering a deeper design;\r\none much more important to his cause.  By the 1st of October it was\r\nfully apparent that Corinth was to be attacked with great force and\r\ndetermination, and that Van Dorn, Lovell, Price, Villepigue and Rust had\r\njoined their strength for this purpose.  There was some skirmishing\r\noutside of Corinth with the advance of the enemy on the 3d.  The rebels\r\nmassed in the north-west angle of the Memphis and Charleston and the\r\nMobile and Ohio railroads, and were thus between the troops at Corinth\r\nand all possible reinforcements.  Any fresh troops for us must come by a\r\ncircuitous route.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 3d, accordingly, I ordered General McPherson, who\r\nwas at Jackson, to join Rosecrans at Corinth with reinforcements picked\r\nup along the line of the railroad equal to a brigade.  Hurlbut had been\r\nordered from Bolivar to march for the same destination; and as Van Dorn\r\nwas coming upon Corinth from the north-west some of his men fell in with\r\nthe advance of Hurlbut's and some skirmishing ensued on the evening of\r\nthe 3d.  On the 4th Van Dorn made a dashing attack, hoping, no doubt, to\r\ncapture Rosecrans before his reinforcements could come up.  In that case\r\nthe enemy himself could have occupied the defences of Corinth and held\r\nat bay all the Union troops that arrived.  In fact he could have taken\r\nthe offensive against the reinforcements with three or four times their\r\nnumber and still left a sufficient garrison in the works about Corinth\r\nto hold them.  He came near success, some of his troops penetrating the\r\nNational lines at least once, but the works that were built after\r\nHalleck's departure enabled Rosecrans to hold his position until the\r\ntroops of both McPherson and Hurlbut approached towards the rebel front\r\nand rear.  The enemy was finally driven back with great slaughter:  all\r\ntheir charges, made with great gallantry, were repulsed.  The loss on\r\nour side was heavy, but nothing to compare with Van Dorn's.  McPherson\r\ncame up with the train of cars bearing his command as close to the enemy\r\nas was prudent, debarked on the rebel flank and got in to the support of\r\nRosecrans just after the repulse.  His approach, as well as that of\r\nHurlbut, was known to the enemy and had a moral effect. General\r\nRosecrans, however, failed to follow up the victory, although I had\r\ngiven specific orders in advance of the battle for him to pursue the\r\nmoment the enemy was repelled.  He did not do so, and I repeated the\r\norder after the battle.  In the first order he was notified that the\r\nforce of 4,000 men which was going to his assistance would be in great\r\nperil if the enemy was not pursued.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ord had joined Hurlbut on the 4th and being senior took command\r\nof his troops.  This force encountered the head of Van Dorn's retreating\r\ncolumn just as it was crossing the Hatchie by a bridge some ten miles\r\nout from Corinth.  The bottom land here was swampy and bad for the\r\noperations of troops, making a good place to get an enemy into.  Ord\r\nattacked the troops that had crossed the bridge and drove them back in a\r\npanic.  Many were killed, and others were drowned by being pushed off\r\nthe bridge in their hurried retreat.  Ord followed and met the main\r\nforce.  He was too weak in numbers to assault, but he held the bridge\r\nand compelled the enemy to resume his retreat by another bridge higher\r\nup the stream.  Ord was wounded in this engagement and the command\r\ndevolved on Hurlbut.\r\n\r\nRosecrans did not start in pursuit till the morning of the 5th and then\r\ntook the wrong road.  Moving in the enemy's country he travelled with a\r\nwagon train to carry his provisions and munitions of war.  His march was\r\ntherefore slower than that of the enemy, who was moving towards his\r\nsupplies.  Two or three hours of pursuit on the day of battle, without\r\nanything except what the men carried on their persons, would have been\r\nworth more than any pursuit commenced the next day could have possibly\r\nbeen.  Even when he did start, if Rosecrans had followed the route taken\r\nby the enemy, he would have come upon Van Dorn in a swamp with a stream\r\nin front and Ord holding the only bridge; but he took the road leading\r\nnorth and towards Chewalla instead of west, and, after having marched as\r\nfar as the enemy had moved to get to the Hatchie, he was as far from\r\nbattle as when he started.  Hurlbut had not the numbers to meet any such\r\nforce as Van Dorn's if they had been in any mood for fighting, and he\r\nmight have been in great peril.\r\n\r\nI now regarded the time to accomplish anything by pursuit as past and,\r\nafter Rosecrans reached Jonesboro, I ordered him to return.  He kept on\r\nto Ripley, however, and was persistent in wanting to go farther.  I\r\nthereupon ordered him to halt and submitted the matter to the\r\ngeneral-in-chief, who allowed me to exercise my judgment in the matter,\r\nbut inquired \"why not pursue?\"  Upon this I ordered Rosecrans back.  Had\r\nhe gone much farther he would have met a greater force than Van Dorn had\r\nat Corinth and behind intrenchments or on chosen ground, and the\r\nprobabilities are he would have lost his army.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Corinth was bloody, our loss being 315 killed, 1,812\r\nwounded and 232 missing.  The enemy lost many more. Rosecrans reported\r\n1,423 dead and 2,225 prisoners.  We fought behind breastworks, which\r\naccounts in some degree for the disparity.  Among the killed on our side\r\nwas General Hackelman.  General Oglesby was badly, it was for some time\r\nsupposed mortally, wounded.  I received a congratulatory letter from the\r\nPresident, which expressed also his sorrow for the losses.\r\n\r\nThis battle was recognized by me as being a decided victory, though not\r\nso complete as I had hoped for, nor nearly so complete as I now think\r\nwas within the easy grasp of the commanding officer at Corinth.  Since\r\nthe war it is known that the result, as it was, was a crushing blow to\r\nthe enemy, and felt by him much more than it was appreciated at the\r\nNorth.  The battle relieved me from any further anxiety for the safety\r\nof the territory within my jurisdiction, and soon after receiving\r\nreinforcements I suggested to the general-in-chief a forward movement\r\nagainst Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of October I learned of Pemberton's being in command at Holly\r\nSprings and much reinforced by conscripts and troops from Alabama and\r\nTexas.  The same day General Rosecrans was relieved from duty with my\r\ncommand, and shortly after he succeeded Buell in the command of the army\r\nin Middle Tennessee.  I was delighted at the promotion of General\r\nRosecrans to a separate command, because I still believed that when\r\nindependent of an immediate superior the qualities which I, at that\r\ntime, credited him with possessing, would show themselves.  As a\r\nsubordinate I found that I could not make him do as I wished, and had\r\ndetermined to relieve him from duty that very day.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the operations just described my force, in round\r\nnumbers, was 48,500.  Of these 4,800 were in Kentucky and Illinois,\r\n7,000 in Memphis, 19,200 from Mound City south, and 17,500 at Corinth.\r\nGeneral McClernand had been authorized from Washington to go north and\r\norganize troops to be used in opening the Mississippi.  These new levies\r\nwith other reinforcements now began to come in.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of October I was placed in command of the Department of the\r\nTennessee.  Reinforcements continued to come from the north and by the\r\n2d of November I was prepared to take the initiative.  This was a great\r\nrelief after the two and a half months of continued defence over a large\r\ndistrict of country, and where nearly every citizen was an enemy ready\r\nto give information of our every move.  I have described very\r\nimperfectly a few of the battles and skirmishes that took place during\r\nthis time.  To describe all would take more space than I can allot to\r\nthe purpose; to make special mention of all the officers and troops who\r\ndistinguished themselves, would take a volume. (*9)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN AGAINST VICKSBURG--EMPLOYING THE FREEDMEN--OCCUPATION OF\r\nHOLLY SPRINGS--SHERMAN ORDERED TO MEMPHIS--SHERMAN'S MOVEMENTS DOWN THE\r\nMISSISSIPPI--VAN DORN CAPTURES HOLLY SPRINGS--COLLECTING FORAGE AND\r\nFOOD.\r\n\r\nVicksburg was important to the enemy because it occupied the first high\r\nground coming close to the river below Memphis.  From there a railroad\r\nruns east, connecting with other roads leading to all points of the\r\nSouthern States.  A railroad also starts from the opposite side of the\r\nriver, extending west as far as Shreveport, Louisiana.  Vicksburg was\r\nthe only channel, at the time of the events of which this chapter\r\ntreats, connecting the parts of the Confederacy divided by the\r\nMississippi.  So long as it was held by the enemy, the free navigation\r\nof the river was prevented.  Hence its importance.  Points on the river\r\nbetween Vicksburg and Port Hudson were held as dependencies; but their\r\nfall was sure to follow the capture of the former place.\r\n\r\nThe campaign against Vicksburg commenced on the 2d of November as\r\nindicated in a dispatch to the general-in-chief in the following words:\r\n\"I have commenced a movement on Grand Junction, with three divisions\r\nfrom Corinth and two from Bolivar.  Will leave here [Jackson, Tennessee]\r\nto-morrow, and take command in person.  If found practicable, I will go\r\nto Holly Springs, and, may be, Grenada, completing railroad and\r\ntelegraph as I go.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time my command was holding the Mobile and Ohio railroad from\r\nabout twenty-five miles south of Corinth, north to Columbus, Kentucky;\r\nthe Mississippi Central from Bolivar north to its junction with the\r\nMobile and Ohio; the Memphis and Charleston from Corinth east to Bear\r\nCreek, and the Mississippi River from Cairo to Memphis.  My entire\r\ncommand was no more than was necessary to hold these lines, and hardly\r\nthat if kept on the defensive.  By moving against the enemy and into his\r\nunsubdued, or not yet captured, territory, driving their army before us,\r\nthese lines would nearly hold themselves; thus affording a large force\r\nfor field operations.  My moving force at that time was about 30,000\r\nmen, and I estimated the enemy confronting me, under Pemberton, at about\r\nthe same number.  General McPherson commanded my left wing and General\r\nC. S. Hamilton the centre, while Sherman was at Memphis with the right\r\nwing.  Pemberton was fortified at the Tallahatchie, but occupied Holly\r\nSprings and Grand Junction on the Mississippi Central railroad.  On the\r\n8th we occupied Grand Junction and La Grange, throwing a considerable\r\nforce seven or eight miles south, along the line of the railroad.  The\r\nroad from Bolivar forward was repaired and put in running order as the\r\ntroops advanced.\r\n\r\nUp to this time it had been regarded as an axiom in war that large\r\nbodies of troops must operate from a base of supplies which they always\r\ncovered and guarded in all forward movements.  There was delay therefore\r\nin repairing the road back, and in gathering and forwarding supplies to\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\nBy my orders, and in accordance with previous instructions from\r\nWashington, all the forage within reach was collected under the\r\nsupervision of the chief quartermaster and the provisions under the\r\nchief commissary, receipts being given when there was any one to take\r\nthem; the supplies in any event to be accounted for as government\r\nstores.  The stock was bountiful, but still it gave me no idea of the\r\npossibility of supplying a moving column in an enemy's country from the\r\ncountry itself.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point, probably, where the first idea of a \"Freedman's\r\nBureau\" took its origin.  Orders of the government prohibited the\r\nexpulsion of the negroes from the protection of the army, when they came\r\nin voluntarily.  Humanity forbade allowing them to starve.  With such an\r\narmy of them, of all ages and both sexes, as had congregated about Grand\r\nJunction, amounting to many thousands, it was impossible to advance.\r\nThere was no special authority for feeding them unless they were\r\nemployed as teamsters, cooks and pioneers with the army; but only\r\nable-bodied young men were suitable for such work.  This labor would\r\nsupport but a very limited percentage of them.  The plantations were all\r\ndeserted; the cotton and corn were ripe: men, women and children above\r\nten years of age could be employed in saving these crops.  To do this\r\nwork with contrabands, or to have it done, organization under a\r\ncompetent chief was necessary.  On inquiring for such a man Chaplain\r\nEaton, now and for many years the very able United States Commissioner\r\nof Education, was suggested.  He proved as efficient in that field as he\r\nhas since done in his present one.  I gave him all the assistants and\r\nguards he called for.  We together fixed the prices to be paid for the\r\nnegro labor, whether rendered to the government or to individuals.  The\r\ncotton was to be picked from abandoned plantations, the laborers to\r\nreceive the stipulated price (my recollection is twelve and a half cents\r\nper pound for picking and ginning) from the quartermaster, he shipping\r\nthe cotton north to be sold for the benefit of the government. Citizens\r\nremaining on their plantations were allowed the privilege of having\r\ntheir crops saved by freedmen on the same terms.\r\n\r\nAt once the freedmen became self-sustaining.  The money was not paid to\r\nthem directly, but was expended judiciously and for their benefit.  They\r\ngave me no trouble afterwards.\r\n\r\nLater the freedmen were engaged in cutting wood along the Mississippi\r\nRiver to supply the large number of steamers on that stream.  A good\r\nprice was paid for chopping wood used for the supply of government\r\nsteamers (steamers chartered and which the government had to supply with\r\nfuel).  Those supplying their own fuel paid a much higher price.  In\r\nthis way a fund was created not only sufficient to feed and clothe all,\r\nold and young, male and female, but to build them comfortable cabins,\r\nhospitals for the sick, and to supply them with many comforts they had\r\nnever known before.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the campaign against Vicksburg I was very much\r\ndisturbed by newspaper rumors that General McClernand was to have a\r\nseparate and independent command within mine, to operate against\r\nVicksburg by way of the Mississippi River.  Two commanders on the same\r\nfield are always one too many, and in this case I did not think the\r\ngeneral selected had either the experience or the qualifications to fit\r\nhim for so important a position.  I feared for the safety of the troops\r\nintrusted to him, especially as he was to raise new levies, raw troops,\r\nto execute so important a trust.  But on the 12th I received a dispatch\r\nfrom General Halleck saying that I had command of all the troops sent to\r\nmy department and authorizing me to fight the enemy where I pleased.\r\nThe next day my cavalry was in Holly Springs, and the enemy fell back\r\nsouth of the Tallahatchie.\r\n\r\nHolly Springs I selected for my depot of supplies and munitions of war,\r\nall of which at that time came by rail from Columbus, Kentucky, except\r\nthe few stores collected about La Grange and Grand Junction.  This was a\r\nlong line (increasing in length as we moved south) to maintain in an\r\nenemy's country.  On the 15th of November, while I was still at Holly\r\nSprings, I sent word to Sherman to meet me at Columbus.  We were but\r\nforty-seven miles apart, yet the most expeditious way for us to meet was\r\nfor me to take the rail to Columbus and Sherman a steamer for the same\r\nplace.  At that meeting, besides talking over my general plans I gave\r\nhim his orders to join me with two divisions and to march them down the\r\nMississippi Central railroad if he could. Sherman, who was always\r\nprompt, was up by the 29th to Cottage Hill, ten miles north of Oxford.\r\nHe brought three divisions with him, leaving a garrison of only four\r\nregiments of infantry, a couple of pieces of artillery and a small\r\ndetachment of cavalry. Further reinforcements he knew were on their way\r\nfrom the north to Memphis.  About this time General Halleck ordered\r\ntroops from Helena, Arkansas (territory west of the Mississippi was not\r\nunder my command then) to cut the road in Pemberton's rear.  The\r\nexpedition was under Generals Hovey and C. C. Washburn and was\r\nsuccessful so far as reaching the railroad was concerned, but the damage\r\ndone was very slight and was soon repaired.\r\n\r\nThe Tallahatchie, which confronted me, was very high, the railroad\r\nbridge destroyed and Pemberton strongly fortified on the south side.  A\r\ncrossing would have been impossible in the presence of an enemy.  I sent\r\nthe cavalry higher up the stream and they secured a crossing.  This\r\ncaused the enemy to evacuate their position, which was possibly\r\naccelerated by the expedition of Hovey and Washburn.  The enemy was\r\nfollowed as far south as Oxford by the main body of troops, and some\r\nseventeen miles farther by McPherson's command.  Here the pursuit was\r\nhalted to repair the railroad from the Tallahatchie northward, in order\r\nto bring up supplies.  The piles on which the railroad bridge rested had\r\nbeen left standing.  The work of constructing a roadway for the troops\r\nwas but a short matter, and, later, rails were laid for cars.\r\n\r\nDuring the delay at Oxford in repairing railroads I learned that an\r\nexpedition down the Mississippi now was inevitable and, desiring to have\r\na competent commander in charge, I ordered Sherman on the 8th of\r\nDecember back to Memphis to take charge. The following were his orders:\r\n\r\nHeadquarters 13th Army Corps, Department of the Tennessee. OXFORD,\r\nMISSISSIPPI, December 8,1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN, Commanding Right Wing:\r\n\r\nYou will proceed, with as little delay as possible, to Memphis,\r\nTennessee, taking with you one division of your present command.  On\r\nyour arrival at Memphis you will assume command of all the troops there,\r\nand that portion of General Curtis's forces at present east of the\r\nMississippi River, and organize them into brigades and divisions in your\r\nown army.  As soon as possible move with them down the river to the\r\nvicinity of Vicksburg, and with the co-operation of the gunboat fleet\r\nunder command of Flag-officer Porter proceed to the reduction of that\r\nplace in such a manner as circumstances, and your own judgment, may\r\ndictate.\r\n\r\nThe amount of rations, forage, land transportation, etc., necessary to\r\ntake, will be left entirely with yourself.  The Quartermaster at St.\r\nLouis will be instructed to send you transportation for 30,000 men;\r\nshould you still find yourself deficient, your quartermaster will be\r\nauthorized to make up the deficiency from such transports as may come\r\ninto the port of Memphis.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Memphis, put yourself in communication with Admiral\r\nPorter, and arrange with him for his co-operation.\r\n\r\nInform me at the earliest practicable day of the time when you will\r\nembark, and such plans as may then be matured.  I will hold the forces\r\nhere in readiness to co-operate with you in such manner as the movements\r\nof the enemy may make necessary.\r\n\r\nLeave the District of Memphis in the command of an efficient officer,\r\nand with a garrison of four regiments of infantry, the siege guns, and\r\nwhatever cavalry may be there.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis idea had presented itself to my mind earlier, for on the 3d of\r\nDecember I asked Halleck if it would not be well to hold the enemy south\r\nof the Yallabusha and move a force from Helena and Memphis on Vicksburg.\r\nOn the 5th again I suggested, from Oxford, to Halleck that if the Helena\r\ntroops were at my command I though it would be possible to take them and\r\nthe Memphis forces south of the mouth of the Yazoo River, and thus\r\nsecure Vicksburg and the State of Mississippi.  Halleck on the same day,\r\nthe 5th of December, directed me not to attempt to hold the country\r\nsouth of the Tallahatchie, but to collect 25,000 troops at Memphis by\r\nthe 20th for the Vicksburg expedition.  I sent Sherman with two\r\ndivisions at once, informed the general-in-chief of the fact, and asked\r\nwhether I should command the expedition down the river myself or send\r\nSherman.  I was authorized to do as I though best for the accomplishment\r\nof the great object in view.  I sent Sherman and so informed General\r\nHalleck.\r\n\r\nAs stated, my action in sending Sherman back was expedited by a desire\r\nto get him in command of the forces separated from my direct\r\nsupervision.  I feared that delay might bring McClernand, who was his\r\nsenior and who had authority from the President and Secretary of War to\r\nexercise that particular command,--and independently.  I doubted\r\nMcClernand's fitness; and I had good reason to believe that in\r\nforestalling him I was by no means giving offence to those whose\r\nauthority to command was above both him and me.\r\n\r\nNeither my orders to General Sherman, nor the correspondence between us\r\nor between General Halleck and myself, contemplated at the time my going\r\nfurther south than the Yallabusha. Pemberton's force in my front was the\r\nmain part of the garrison of Vicksburg, as the force with me was the\r\ndefence of the territory held by us in West Tennessee and Kentucky.  I\r\nhoped to hold Pemberton in my front while Sherman should get in his rear\r\nand into Vicksburg.  The further north the enemy could be held the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nIt was understood, however, between General Sherman and myself that our\r\nmovements were to be co-operative; if Pemberton could not be held away\r\nfrom Vicksburg I was to follow him; but at that time it was not expected\r\nto abandon the railroad north of the Yallabusha.  With that point as a\r\nsecondary base of supplies, the possibility of moving down the Yazoo\r\nuntil communications could be opened with the Mississippi was\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention, and so understood by Sherman and his command, that\r\nif the enemy should fall back I would follow him even to the gates of\r\nVicksburg.  I intended in such an event to hold the road to Grenada on\r\nthe Yallabusha and cut loose from there, expecting to establish a new\r\nbase of supplies on the Yazoo, or at Vicksburg itself, with Grenada to\r\nfall back upon in case of failure.  It should be remembered that at the\r\ntime I speak of it had not been demonstrated that an army could operate\r\nin an enemy's territory depending upon the country for supplies.  A halt\r\nwas called at Oxford with the advance seventeen miles south of there, to\r\nbring up the road to the latter point and to bring supplies of food,\r\nforage and munitions to the front.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of December I received orders from Washington to divide my\r\ncommand into four army corps, with General McClernand to command one of\r\nthem and to be assigned to that part of the army which was to operate\r\ndown the Mississippi.  This interfered with my plans, but probably\r\nresulted in my ultimately taking the command in person.  McClernand was\r\nat that time in Springfield, Illinois.  The order was obeyed without any\r\ndelay.  Dispatches were sent to him the same day in conformity.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th General Van Dorn appeared at Holly Springs, my secondary\r\nbase of supplies, captured the garrison of 1,500 men commanded by\r\nColonel Murphy, of the 8th Wisconsin regiment, and destroyed all our\r\nmunitions of war, food and forage.  The capture was a disgraceful one to\r\nthe officer commanding but not to the troops under him.  At the same\r\ntime Forrest got on our line of railroad between Jackson, Tennessee, and\r\nColumbus, Kentucky, doing much damage to it.  This cut me off from all\r\ncommunication with the north for more than a week, and it was more than\r\ntwo weeks before rations or forage could be issued from stores obtained\r\nin the regular way.  This demonstrated the impossibility of maintaining\r\nso long a line of road over which to draw supplies for an army moving in\r\nan enemy's country.  I determined, therefore, to abandon my campaign\r\ninto the interior with Columbus as a base, and returned to La Grange and\r\nGrand Junction destroying the road to my front and repairing the road to\r\nMemphis, making the Mississippi river the line over which to draw\r\nsupplies.  Pemberton was falling back at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe moment I received the news of Van Dorn's success I sent the cavalry\r\nat the front back to drive him from the country.  He had start enough to\r\nmove north destroying the railroad in many places, and to attack several\r\nsmall garrisons intrenched as guards to the railroad.  All these he\r\nfound warned of his coming and prepared to receive him.  Van Dorn did\r\nnot succeed in capturing a single garrison except the one at Holly\r\nSprings, which was larger than all the others attacked by him put\r\ntogether.  Murphy was also warned of Van Dorn's approach, but made no\r\npreparations to meet him.  He did not even notify his command.\r\n\r\nColonel Murphy was the officer who, two months before, had evacuated\r\nIuka on the approach of the enemy.  General Rosecrans denounced him for\r\nthe act and desired to have him tried and punished.  I sustained the\r\ncolonel at the time because his command was a small one compared with\r\nthat of the enemy--not one-tenth as large--and I thought he had done\r\nwell to get away without falling into their hands.  His leaving large\r\nstores to fall into Price's possession I looked upon as an oversight and\r\nexcused it on the ground of inexperience in military matters. He should,\r\nhowever, have destroyed them.  This last surrender demonstrated to my\r\nmind that Rosecrans' judgment of Murphy's conduct at Iuka was correct.\r\nThe surrender of Holly Springs was most reprehensible and showed either\r\nthe disloyalty of Colonel Murphy to the cause which he professed to\r\nserve, or gross cowardice.\r\n\r\nAfter the war was over I read from the diary of a lady who accompanied\r\nGeneral Pemberton in his retreat from the Tallahatchie, that the retreat\r\nwas almost a panic.  The roads were bad and it was difficult to move the\r\nartillery and trains.  Why there should have been a panic I do not see.\r\nNo expedition had yet started down the Mississippi River.  Had I known\r\nthe demoralized condition of the enemy, or the fact that central\r\nMississippi abounded so in all army supplies, I would have been in\r\npursuit of Pemberton while his cavalry was destroying the roads in my\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nAfter sending cavalry to drive Van Dorn away, my next order was to\r\ndispatch all the wagons we had, under proper escort, to collect and\r\nbring in all supplies of forage and food from a region of fifteen miles\r\neast and west of the road from our front back to Grand Junction, leaving\r\ntwo months' supplies for the families of those whose stores were taken.\r\nI was amazed at the quantity of supplies the country afforded.  It\r\nshowed that we could have subsisted off the country for two months\r\ninstead of two weeks without going beyond the limits designated.  This\r\ntaught me a lesson which was taken advantage of later in the campaign\r\nwhen our army lived twenty days with the issue of only five days'\r\nrations by the commissary.  Our loss of supplies was great at Holly\r\nSprings, but it was more than compensated for by those taken from the\r\ncountry and by the lesson taught.\r\n\r\nThe news of the capture of Holly Springs and the destruction of our\r\nsupplies caused much rejoicing among the people remaining in Oxford.\r\nThey came with broad smiles on their faces, indicating intense joy, to\r\nask what I was going to do now without anything for my soldiers to eat.\r\nI told them that I was not disturbed; that I had already sent troops and\r\nwagons to collect all the food and forage they could find for fifteen\r\nmiles on each side of the road.  Countenances soon changed, and so did\r\nthe inquiry.  The next was, \"What are WE to do?\"  My response was that\r\nwe had endeavored to feed ourselves from our own northern resources\r\nwhile visiting them; but their friends in gray had been uncivil enough\r\nto destroy what we had brought along, and it could not be expected that\r\nmen, with arms in their hands, would starve in the midst of plenty.  I\r\nadvised them to emigrate east, or west, fifteen miles and assist in\r\neating up what we left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MOVED TO HOLLY SPRINGS--GENERAL M'CLERNAND IN COMMAND\r\n--ASSUMING COMMAND AT YOUNG'S POINT--OPERATIONS ABOVE VICKSBURG\r\n--FORTIFICATIONS ABOUT VICKSBURG--THE CANAL--LAKE PROVIDENCE\r\n--OPERATIONS AT YAZOO PASS.\r\n\r\nThis interruption in my communications north--I was really cut off from\r\ncommunication with a great part of my own command during this time\r\n--resulted in Sherman's moving from Memphis before McClernand could\r\narrive, for my dispatch of the 18th did not reach McClernand.  Pemberton\r\ngot back to Vicksburg before Sherman got there.  The rebel positions\r\nwere on a bluff on the Yazoo River, some miles above its mouth.  The\r\nwaters were high so that the bottoms were generally overflowed, leaving\r\nonly narrow causeways of dry land between points of debarkation and the\r\nhigh bluffs.  These were fortified and defended at all points.  The\r\nrebel position was impregnable against any force that could be brought\r\nagainst its front.  Sherman could not use one-fourth of his force.  His\r\nefforts to capture the city, or the high ground north of it, were\r\nnecessarily unavailing.\r\n\r\nSherman's attack was very unfortunate, but I had no opportunity of\r\ncommunicating with him after the destruction of the road and telegraph\r\nto my rear on the 20th.  He did not know but what I was in the rear of\r\nthe enemy and depending on him to open a new base of supplies for the\r\ntroops with me.  I had, before he started from Memphis, directed him to\r\ntake with him a few small steamers suitable for the navigation of the\r\nYazoo, not knowing but that I might want them to supply me after cutting\r\nloose from my base at Grenada.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d I removed my headquarters back to Holly Springs.  The troops\r\nwere drawn back gradually, but without haste or confusion, finding\r\nsupplies abundant and no enemy following.  The road was not damaged\r\nsouth of Holly Springs by Van Dorn, at least not to an extent to cause\r\nany delay.  As I had resolved to move headquarters to Memphis, and to\r\nrepair the road to that point, I remained at Holly Springs until this\r\nwork was completed.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of January, the work on the road from Holly Springs to Grand\r\nJunction and thence to Memphis being completed, I moved my headquarters\r\nto the latter place.  During the campaign here described, the losses\r\n(mostly captures) were about equal, crediting the rebels with their\r\nHolly Springs capture, which they could not hold.\r\n\r\nWhen Sherman started on his expedition down the river he had 20,000 men,\r\ntaken from Memphis, and was reinforced by 12,000 more at Helena,\r\nArkansas.  The troops on the west bank of the river had previously been\r\nassigned to my command.  McClernand having received the orders for his\r\nassignment reached the mouth of the Yazoo on the 2d of January, and\r\nimmediately assumed command of all the troops with Sherman, being a part\r\nof his own corps, the 13th, and all of Sherman's, the 15th.  Sherman,\r\nand Admiral Porter with the fleet, had withdrawn from the Yazoo. After\r\nconsultation they decided that neither the army nor navy could render\r\nservice to the cause where they were, and learning that I had withdrawn\r\nfrom the interior of Mississippi, they determined to return to the\r\nArkansas River and to attack Arkansas Post, about fifty miles up that\r\nstream and garrisoned by about five or six thousand men.  Sherman had\r\nlearned of the existence of this force through a man who had been\r\ncaptured by the enemy with a steamer loaded with ammunition and other\r\nsupplies intended for his command.  The man had made his escape.\r\nMcClernand approved this move reluctantly, as Sherman says.  No obstacle\r\nwas encountered until the gunboats and transports were within range of\r\nthe fort.  After three days' bombardment by the navy an assault was made\r\nby the troops and marines, resulting in the capture of the place, and in\r\ntaking 5,000 prisoners and 17 guns.  I was at first disposed to\r\ndisapprove of this move as an unnecessary side movement having no\r\nespecial bearing upon the work before us; but when the result was\r\nunderstood I regarded it as very important.  Five thousand Confederate\r\ntroops left in the rear might have caused us much trouble and loss of\r\nproperty while navigating the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the reduction of Arkansas Post and the capture of the\r\ngarrison, McClernand returned with his entire force to Napoleon, at the\r\nmouth of the Arkansas River.  From here I received messages from both\r\nSherman and Admiral Porter, urging me to come and take command in\r\nperson, and expressing their distrust of McClernand's ability and\r\nfitness for so important and intricate an expedition.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th I visited McClernand and his command at Napoleon. It was\r\nhere made evident to me that both the army and navy were so distrustful\r\nof McClernand's fitness to command that, while they would do all they\r\ncould to insure success, this distrust was an element of weakness.  It\r\nwould have been criminal to send troops under these circumstances into\r\nsuch danger.  By this time I had received authority to relieve\r\nMcClernand, or to assign any person else to the command of the river\r\nexpedition, or to assume command in person.  I felt great embarrassment\r\nabout McClernand.  He was the senior major-general after myself within\r\nthe department.  It would not do, with his rank and ambition, to assign\r\na junior over him.  Nothing was left, therefore, but to assume the\r\ncommand myself.  I would have been glad to put Sherman in command, to\r\ngive him an opportunity to accomplish what he had failed in the December\r\nbefore; but there seemed no other way out of the difficulty, for he was\r\njunior to McClernand.  Sherman's failure needs no apology.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th I ordered General McClernand with the entire command, to\r\nYoung's Point and Milliken's Bend, while I returned to Memphis to make\r\nall the necessary preparation for leaving the territory behind me\r\nsecure.  General Hurlbut with the 16th corps was left in command.  The\r\nMemphis and Charleston railroad was held, while the Mississippi Central\r\nwas given up.  Columbus was the only point between Cairo and Memphis, on\r\nthe river, left with a garrison.  All the troops and guns from the posts\r\non the abandoned railroad and river were sent to the front.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of January I arrived at Young's Point and assumed command\r\nthe following day.  General McClernand took exception in a most\r\ncharacteristic way--for him.  His correspondence with me on the subject\r\nwas more in the nature of a reprimand than a protest. It was highly\r\ninsubordinate, but I overlooked it, as I believed, for the good of the\r\nservice.  General McClernand was a politician of very considerable\r\nprominence in his State; he was a member of Congress when the secession\r\nwar broke out; he belonged to that political party which furnished all\r\nthe opposition there was to a vigorous prosecution of the war for saving\r\nthe Union; there was no delay in his declaring himself for the Union at\r\nall hazards, and there was no uncertain sound in his declaration of\r\nwhere he stood in the contest before the country.  He also gave up his\r\nseat in Congress to take the field in defence of the principles he had\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe real work of the campaign and siege of Vicksburg now began.  The\r\nproblem was to secure a footing upon dry ground on the east side of the\r\nriver from which the troops could operate against Vicksburg.  The\r\nMississippi River, from Cairo south, runs through a rich alluvial valley\r\nof many miles in width, bound on the east by land running from eighty up\r\nto two or more hundred feet above the river.  On the west side the\r\nhighest land, except in a few places, is but little above the highest\r\nwater.  Through this valley the river meanders in the most tortuous way,\r\nvarying in direction to all points of the compass.  At places it runs to\r\nthe very foot of the bluffs. After leaving Memphis, there are no such\r\nhighlands coming to the water's edge on the east shore until Vicksburg\r\nis reached.\r\n\r\nThe intervening land is cut up by bayous filled from the river in high\r\nwater--many of them navigable for steamers.  All of them would be,\r\nexcept for overhanging trees, narrowness and tortuous course, making it\r\nimpossible to turn the bends with vessels of any considerable length.\r\nMarching across this country in the face of an enemy was impossible;\r\nnavigating it proved equally impracticable.  The strategical way\r\naccording to the rule, therefore, would have been to go back to Memphis;\r\nestablish that as a base of supplies; fortify it so that the storehouses\r\ncould be held by a small garrison, and move from there along the line of\r\nrailroad, repairing as we advanced, to the Yallabusha, or to Jackson,\r\nMississippi.  At this time the North had become very much discouraged.\r\nMany strong Union men believed that the war must prove a failure.  The\r\nelections of 1862 had gone against the party which was for the\r\nprosecution of the war to save the Union if it took the last man and the\r\nlast dollar.  Voluntary enlistments had ceased throughout the greater\r\npart of the North, and the draft had been resorted to to fill up our\r\nranks.  It was my judgment at the time that to make a backward movement\r\nas long as that from Vicksburg to Memphis, would be interpreted, by many\r\nof those yet full of hope for the preservation of the Union, as a\r\ndefeat, and that the draft would be resisted, desertions ensue and the\r\npower to capture and punish deserters lost. There was nothing left to be\r\ndone but to go FORWARD TO A DECISIVE VICTORY.  This was in my mind from\r\nthe moment I took command in person at Young's Point.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1862-3 was a noted one for continuous high water in the\r\nMississippi and for heavy rains along the lower river. To get dry land,\r\nor rather land above the water, to encamp the troops upon, took many\r\nmiles of river front.  We had to occupy the levees and the ground\r\nimmediately behind.  This was so limited that one corps, the 17th, under\r\nGeneral McPherson, was at Lake Providence, seventy miles above\r\nVicksburg.\r\n\r\nIt was in January the troops took their position opposite Vicksburg.\r\nThe water was very high and the rains were incessant.  There seemed no\r\npossibility of a land movement before the end of March or later, and it\r\nwould not do to lie idle all this time.  The effect would be\r\ndemoralizing to the troops and injurious to their health.  Friends in\r\nthe North would have grown more and more discouraged, and enemies in the\r\nsame section more and more insolent in their gibes and denunciation of\r\nthe cause and those engaged in it.\r\n\r\nI always admired the South, as bad as I thought their cause, for the\r\nboldness with which they silenced all opposition and all croaking, by\r\npress or by individuals, within their control.  War at all times,\r\nwhether a civil war between sections of a common country or between\r\nnations, ought to be avoided, if possible with honor.  But, once entered\r\ninto, it is too much for human nature to tolerate an enemy within their\r\nranks to give aid and comfort to the armies of the opposing section or\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nVicksburg, as stated before, is on the first high land coming to the\r\nriver's edge, below that on which Memphis stands.  The bluff, or high\r\nland, follows the left bank of the Yazoo for some distance and continues\r\nin a southerly direction to the Mississippi River, thence it runs along\r\nthe Mississippi to Warrenton, six miles below.  The Yazoo River leaves\r\nthe high land a short distance below Haines' Bluff and empties into the\r\nMississippi nine miles above Vicksburg.  Vicksburg is built on this high\r\nland where the Mississippi washes the base of the hill.  Haines' Bluff,\r\neleven miles from Vicksburg, on the Yazoo River, was strongly fortified.\r\nThe whole distance from there to Vicksburg and thence to Warrenton was\r\nalso intrenched, with batteries at suitable distances and rifle-pits\r\nconnecting them.\r\n\r\nFrom Young's Point the Mississippi turns in a north-easterly direction\r\nto a point just above the city, when it again turns and runs\r\nsouth-westerly, leaving vessels, which might attempt to run the blockade,\r\nexposed to the fire of batteries six miles below the city before they\r\nwere in range of the upper batteries.  Since then the river has made a\r\ncut-off, leaving what was the peninsula in front of the city, an island.\r\nNorth of the Yazoo was all a marsh, heavily timbered, cut up with\r\nbayous, and much overflowed.  A front attack was therefore impossible,\r\nand was never contemplated; certainly not by me. The problem then\r\nbecame, how to secure a landing on high ground east of the Mississippi\r\nwithout an apparent retreat.  Then commenced a series of experiments to\r\nconsume time, and to divert the attention of the enemy, of my troops and\r\nof the public generally.  I, myself, never felt great confidence that\r\nany of the experiments resorted to would prove successful. Nevertheless\r\nI was always prepared to take advantage of them in case they did.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 General Thomas Williams had come up from New Orleans and cut a\r\nditch ten or twelve feet wide and about as deep, straight across from\r\nYoung's Point to the river below.  The distance across was a little over\r\na mile.  It was Williams' expectation that when the river rose it would\r\ncut a navigable channel through; but the canal started in an eddy from\r\nboth ends, and, of course, it only filled up with water on the rise\r\nwithout doing any execution in the way of cutting.  Mr. Lincoln had\r\nnavigated the Mississippi in his younger days and understood well its\r\ntendency to change its channel, in places, from time to time.  He set\r\nmuch store accordingly by this canal.  General McClernand had been,\r\ntherefore, directed before I went to Young's Point to push the work of\r\nwidening and deepening this canal.  After my arrival the work was\r\ndiligently pushed with about 4,000 men--as many as could be used to\r\nadvantage--until interrupted by a sudden rise in the river that broke a\r\ndam at the upper end, which had been put there to keep the water out\r\nuntil the excavation was completed.  This was on the 8th of March.\r\n\r\nEven if the canal had proven a success, so far as to be navigable for\r\nsteamers, it could not have been of much advantage to us.  It runs in a\r\ndirection almost perpendicular to the line of bluffs on the opposite\r\nside, or east bank, of the river.  As soon as the enemy discovered what\r\nwe were doing he established a battery commanding the canal throughout\r\nits length.  This battery soon drove out our dredges, two in number,\r\nwhich were doing the work of thousands of men.  Had the canal been\r\ncompleted it might have proven of some use in running transports\r\nthrough, under the cover of night, to use below; but they would yet have\r\nto run batteries, though for a much shorter distance.\r\n\r\nWhile this work was progressing we were busy in other directions, trying\r\nto find an available landing on high ground on the east bank of the\r\nriver, or to make water-ways to get below the city, avoiding the\r\nbatteries.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of January, the day after my arrival at the front, I ordered\r\nGeneral McPherson, stationed with his corps at Lake Providence, to cut\r\nthe levee at that point.  If successful in opening a channel for\r\nnavigation by this route, it would carry us to the Mississippi River\r\nthrough the mouth of the Red River, just above Port Hudson and four\r\nhundred miles below Vicksburg by the river.\r\n\r\nLake Providence is a part of the old bed of the Mississippi, about a\r\nmile from the present channel.  It is six miles long and has its outlet\r\nthrough Bayou Baxter, Bayou Macon, and the Tensas, Washita and Red\r\nRivers.  The last three are navigable streams at all seasons.  Bayous\r\nBaxter and Macon are narrow and tortuous, and the banks are covered with\r\ndense forests overhanging the channel.  They were also filled with\r\nfallen timber, the accumulation of years.  The land along the\r\nMississippi River, from Memphis down, is in all instances highest next\r\nto the river, except where the river washes the bluffs which form the\r\nboundary of the valley through which it winds.  Bayou Baxter, as it\r\nreaches lower land, begins to spread out and disappears entirely in a\r\ncypress swamp before it reaches the Macon.  There was about two feet of\r\nwater in this swamp at the time.  To get through it, even with vessels\r\nof the lightest draft, it was necessary to clear off a belt of heavy\r\ntimber wide enough to make a passage way.  As the trees would have to be\r\ncut close to the bottom--under water--it was an undertaking of great\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of February I visited General McPherson, and remained with\r\nhim several days.  The work had not progressed so far as to admit the\r\nwater from the river into the lake, but the troops had succeeded in\r\ndrawing a small steamer, of probably not over thirty tons' capacity,\r\nfrom the river into the lake.  With this we were able to explore the\r\nlake and bayou as far as cleared.  I saw then that there was scarcely a\r\nchance of this ever becoming a practicable route for moving troops\r\nthrough an enemy's country.  The distance from Lake Providence to the\r\npoint where vessels going by that route would enter the Mississippi\r\nagain, is about four hundred and seventy miles by the main river.  The\r\ndistance would probably be greater by the tortuous bayous through which\r\nthis new route would carry us.  The enemy held Port Hudson, below where\r\nthe Red River debouches, and all the Mississippi above to Vicksburg.\r\nThe Red River, Washita and Tensas were, as has been said, all navigable\r\nstreams, on which the enemy could throw small bodies of men to obstruct\r\nour passage and pick off our troops with their sharpshooters.  I let the\r\nwork go on, believing employment was better than idleness for the men.\r\nThen, too, it served as a cover for other efforts which gave a better\r\nprospect of success.  This work was abandoned after the canal proved a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Wilson of my staff was sent to Helena, Arkansas, to\r\nexamine and open a way through Moon Lake and the Yazoo Pass if possible.\r\nFormerly there was a route by way of an inlet from the Mississippi River\r\ninto Moon Lake, a mile east of the river, thence east through Yazoo Pass\r\nto Coldwater, along the latter to the Tallahatchie, which joins the\r\nYallabusha about two hundred and fifty miles below Moon Lake and forms\r\nthe Yazoo River.  These were formerly navigated by steamers trading with\r\nthe rich plantations along their banks; but the State of Mississippi had\r\nbuilt a strong levee across the inlet some years before, leaving the\r\nonly entrance for vessels into this rich region the one by way of the\r\nmouth of the Yazoo several hundreds of miles below.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of February this dam, or levee, was cut.  The river being high\r\nthe rush of water through the cut was so great that in a very short time\r\nthe entire obstruction was washed away. The bayous were soon filled and\r\nmuch of the country was overflowed. This pass leaves the Mississippi\r\nRiver but a few miles below Helena. On the 24th General Ross, with his\r\nbrigade of about 4,500 men on transports, moved into this new water-way.\r\nThe rebels had obstructed the navigation of Yazoo Pass and the Coldwater\r\nby felling trees into them.  Much of the timber in this region being of\r\ngreater specific gravity than water, and being of great size, their\r\nremoval was a matter of great labor; but it was finally accomplished,\r\nand on the 11th of March Ross found himself, accompanied by two gunboats\r\nunder the command of Lieutenant-Commander Watson Smith, confronting a\r\nfortification at Greenwood, where the Tallahatchie and Yallabusha unite\r\nand the Yazoo begins.  The bends of the rivers are such at this point as\r\nto almost form an island, scarcely above water at that stage of the\r\nriver.  This island was fortified and manned.  It was named Fort\r\nPemberton after the commander at Vicksburg.  No land approach was\r\naccessible.  The troops, therefore, could render no assistance towards\r\nan assault further than to establish a battery on a little piece of\r\nground which was discovered above water.  The gunboats, however,\r\nattacked on the 11th and again on the 13th of March.  Both efforts were\r\nfailures and were not renewed.  One gunboat was disabled and we lost six\r\nmen killed and twenty-five wounded. The loss of the enemy was less.\r\n\r\nFort Pemberton was so little above the water that it was thought that a\r\nrise of two feet would drive the enemy out.  In hope of enlisting the\r\nelements on our side, which had been so much against us up to this time,\r\na second cut was made in the Mississippi levee, this time directly\r\nopposite Helena, or six miles above the former cut.  It did not\r\naccomplish the desired result, and Ross, with his fleet, started back.\r\nOn the 22d he met Quinby with a brigade at Yazoo Pass.  Quinby was the\r\nsenior of Ross, and assumed command.  He was not satisfied with\r\nreturning to his former position without seeing for himself whether\r\nanything could be accomplished.  Accordingly Fort Pemberton was\r\nrevisited by our troops; but an inspection was sufficient this time\r\nwithout an attack.  Quinby, with his command, returned with but little\r\ndelay.  In the meantime I was much exercised for the safety of Ross, not\r\nknowing that Quinby had been able to join him.  Reinforcements were of\r\nno use in a country covered with water, as they would have to remain on\r\nboard of their transports.  Relief had to come from another quarter.  So\r\nI determined to get into the Yazoo below Fort Pemberton.\r\n\r\nSteel's Bayou empties into the Yazoo River between Haines' Bluff and its\r\nmouth.  It is narrow, very tortuous, and fringed with a very heavy\r\ngrowth of timber, but it is deep.  It approaches to within one mile of\r\nthe Mississippi at Eagle Bend, thirty miles above Young's Point.\r\nSteel's Bayou connects with Black Bayou, Black Bayou with Deer Creek,\r\nDeer Creek with Rolling Fork, Rolling Fork with the Big Sunflower River,\r\nand the Big Sunflower with the Yazoo River about ten miles above Haines'\r\nBluff in a right line but probably twenty or twenty-five miles by the\r\nwinding of the river.  All these waterways are of about the same nature\r\nso far as navigation is concerned, until the Sunflower is reached; this\r\naffords free navigation.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Porter explored this waterway as far as Deer Creek on the 14th\r\nof March, and reported it navigable.  On the next day he started with\r\nfive gunboats and four mortar-boats.  I went with him for some distance.\r\nThe heavy overhanging timber retarded progress very much, as did also\r\nthe short turns in so narrow a stream.  The gunboats, however, ploughed\r\ntheir way through without other damage than to their appearance.  The\r\ntransports did not fare so well although they followed behind. The road\r\nwas somewhat cleared for them by the gunboats.  In the evening I\r\nreturned to headquarters to hurry up reinforcements. Sherman went in\r\nperson on the 16th, taking with him Stuart's division of the 15th corps.\r\nThey took large river transports to Eagle Bend on the Mississippi, where\r\nthey debarked and marched across to Steel's Bayou, where they\r\nre-embarked on the transports.  The river steamers, with their tall\r\nsmokestacks and light guards extending out, were so much impeded that\r\nthe gunboats got far ahead.  Porter, with his fleet, got within a few\r\nhundred yards of where the sailing would have been clear and free from\r\nthe obstructions caused by felling trees into the water, when he\r\nencountered rebel sharp-shooters, and his progress was delayed by\r\nobstructions in his front.  He could do nothing with gunboats against\r\nsharpshooters.  The rebels, learning his route, had sent in about 4,000\r\nmen--many more than there were sailors in the fleet.\r\n\r\nSherman went back, at the request of the admiral, to clear out Black\r\nBayou and to hurry up reinforcements, which were far behind.  On the\r\nnight of the 19th he received notice from the admiral that he had been\r\nattacked by sharp-shooters and was in imminent peril.  Sherman at once\r\nreturned through Black Bayou in a canoe, and passed on until he met a\r\nsteamer, with the last of the reinforcements he had, coming up.  They\r\ntried to force their way through Black Bayou with their steamer, but,\r\nfinding it slow and tedious work, debarked and pushed forward on foot.\r\nIt was night when they landed, and intensely dark.  There was but a\r\nnarrow strip of land above water, and that was grown up with underbrush\r\nor cane.  The troops lighted their way through this with candles carried\r\nin their hands for a mile and a half, when they came to an open\r\nplantation.  Here the troops rested until morning.  They made twenty-one\r\nmiles from this resting-place by noon the next day, and were in time to\r\nrescue the fleet.  Porter had fully made up his mind to blow up the\r\ngunboats rather than have them fall into the hands of the enemy.  More\r\nwelcome visitors he probably never met than the \"boys in blue\" on this\r\noccasion.  The vessels were backed out and returned to their rendezvous\r\non the Mississippi; and thus ended in failure the fourth attempt to get\r\nin rear of Vicksburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE BAYOUS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI--CRITICISMS OF THE  NORTHERN PRESS\r\n--RUNNING THE BATTERIES--LOSS OF THE INDIANOLA--DISPOSITION OF THE\r\nTROOPS.\r\n\r\nThe original canal scheme was also abandoned on the 27th of March.  The\r\neffort to make a waterway through Lake Providence and the connecting\r\nbayous was abandoned as wholly impracticable about the same time.\r\n\r\nAt Milliken's Bend, and also at Young's Point, bayous or channels start,\r\nwhich connecting with other bayous passing Richmond, Louisiana, enter\r\nthe Mississippi at Carthage twenty-five or thirty miles above Grand\r\nGulf.  The Mississippi levee cuts the supply of water off from these\r\nbayous or channels, but all the rainfall behind the levee, at these\r\npoints, is carried through these same channels to the river below.  In\r\ncase of a crevasse in this vicinity, the water escaping would find its\r\noutlet through the same channels.  The dredges and laborers from the\r\ncanal having been driven out by overflow and the enemy's batteries, I\r\ndetermined to open these other channels, if possible.  If successful the\r\neffort would afford a route, away from the enemy's batteries, for our\r\ntransports.  There was a good road back of the levees, along these\r\nbayous, to carry the troops, artillery and wagon trains over whenever\r\nthe water receded a little, and after a few days of dry weather.\r\nAccordingly, with the abandonment of all the other plans for reaching a\r\nbase heretofore described, this new one was undertaken.\r\n\r\nAs early as the 4th of February I had written to Halleck about this\r\nroute, stating that I thought it much more practicable than the other\r\nundertaking (the Lake Providence route), and that it would have been\r\naccomplished with much less labor if commenced before the water had got\r\nall over the country.\r\n\r\nThe upper end of these bayous being cut off from a water supply, further\r\nthan the rainfall back of the levees, was grown up with dense timber for\r\na distance of several miles from their source.  It was necessary,\r\ntherefore, to clear this out before letting in the water from the river.\r\nThis work was continued until the waters of the river began to recede\r\nand the road to Richmond, Louisiana, emerged from the water.  One small\r\nsteamer and some barges were got through this channel, but no further\r\nuse could be made of it because of the fall in the river. Beyond this it\r\nwas no more successful than the other experiments with which the winter\r\nwas whiled away.  All these failures would have been very discouraging\r\nif I had expected much from the efforts; but I had not.  From the first\r\nthe most I hoped to accomplish was the passage of transports, to be used\r\nbelow Vicksburg, without exposure to the long line of batteries\r\ndefending that city.\r\n\r\nThis long, dreary and, for heavy and continuous rains and high water,\r\nunprecedented winter was one of great hardship to all engaged about\r\nVicksburg.  The river was higher than its natural banks from December,\r\n1862, to the following April.  The war had suspended peaceful pursuits\r\nin the South, further than the production of army supplies, and in\r\nconsequence the levees were neglected and broken in many places and the\r\nwhole country was covered with water.  Troops could scarcely find dry\r\nground on which to pitch their tents.  Malarial fevers broke out among\r\nthe men.  Measles and small-pox also attacked them.  The hospital\r\narrangements and medical attendance were so perfect, however, that the\r\nloss of life was much less than might have been expected.  Visitors to\r\nthe camps went home with dismal stories to relate; Northern papers came\r\nback to the soldiers with these stories exaggerated.  Because I would\r\nnot divulge my ultimate plans to visitors, they pronounced me idle,\r\nincompetent and unfit to command men in an emergency, and clamored for\r\nmy removal.  They were not to be satisfied, many of them, with my simple\r\nremoval, but named who my successor should be. McClernand, Fremont,\r\nHunter and McClellan were all mentioned in this connection.  I took no\r\nsteps to answer these complaints, but continued to do my duty, as I\r\nunderstood it, to the best of my ability.  Every one has his\r\nsuperstitions.  One of mine is that in positions of great responsibility\r\nevery one should do his duty to the best of his ability where assigned\r\nby competent authority, without application or the use of influence to\r\nchange his position.  While at Cairo I had watched with very great\r\ninterest the operations of the Army of the Potomac, looking upon that as\r\nthe main field of the war.  I had no idea, myself, of ever having any\r\nlarge command, nor did I suppose that I was equal to one; but I had the\r\nvanity to think that as a cavalry officer I might succeed very well in\r\nthe command of a brigade. On one occasion, in talking about this to my\r\nstaff officers, all of whom were civilians without any military\r\neducation whatever, I said that I would give anything if I were\r\ncommanding a brigade of cavalry in the Army of the Potomac and I\r\nbelieved I could do some good.  Captain Hillyer spoke up and suggested\r\nthat I make application to be transferred there to command the cavalry.\r\nI then told him that I would cut my right arm off first, and mentioned\r\nthis superstition.\r\n\r\nIn time of war the President, being by the Constitution\r\nCommander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, is responsible for the\r\nselection of commanders.  He should not be embarrassed in making his\r\nselections.  I having been selected, my responsibility ended with my\r\ndoing the best I knew how.  If I had sought the place, or obtained it\r\nthrough personal or political influence, my belief is that I would have\r\nfeared to undertake any plan of my own conception, and would probably\r\nhave awaited direct orders from my distant superiors.  Persons obtaining\r\nimportant commands by application or political influence are apt to keep\r\na written record of complaints and predictions of defeat, which are\r\nshown in case of disaster.  Somebody must be responsible for their\r\nfailures.\r\n\r\nWith all the pressure brought to bear upon them, both President Lincoln\r\nand General Halleck stood by me to the end of the campaign.  I had never\r\nmet Mr.  Lincoln, but his support was constant.\r\n\r\nAt last the waters began to recede; the roads crossing the peninsula\r\nbehind the levees of the bayous, were emerging from the waters; the\r\ntroops were all concentrated from distant points at Milliken's Bend\r\npreparatory to a final move which was to crown the long, tedious and\r\ndiscouraging labors with success.\r\n\r\nI had had in contemplation the whole winter the movement by land to a\r\npoint below Vicksburg from which to operate, subject only to the\r\npossible but not expected success of some one of the expedients resorted\r\nto for the purpose of giving us a different base.  This could not be\r\nundertaken until the waters receded.  I did not therefore communicate\r\nthis plan, even to an officer of my staff, until it was necessary to\r\nmake preparations for the start.  My recollection is that Admiral Porter\r\nwas the first one to whom I mentioned it.  The co-operation of the navy\r\nwas absolutely essential to the success (even to the contemplation) of\r\nsuch an enterprise.  I had no more authority to command Porter than he\r\nhad to command me.  It was necessary to have part of his fleet below\r\nVicksburg if the troops went there.  Steamers to use as ferries were\r\nalso essential.  The navy was the only escort and protection for these\r\nsteamers, all of which in getting below had to run about fourteen miles\r\nof batteries. Porter fell into the plan at once, and suggested that he\r\nhad better superintend the preparation of the steamers selected to run\r\nthe batteries, as sailors would probably understand the work better than\r\nsoldiers.  I was glad to accept his proposition, not only because I\r\nadmitted his argument, but because it would enable me to keep from the\r\nenemy a little longer our designs. Porter's fleet was on the east side\r\nof the river above the mouth of the Yazoo, entirely concealed from the\r\nenemy by the dense forests that intervened.  Even spies could not get\r\nnear him, on account of the undergrowth and overflowed lands.\r\nSuspicions of some mysterious movements were aroused.  Our river guards\r\ndiscovered one day a small skiff moving quietly and mysteriously up the\r\nriver near the east shore, from the direction of Vicksburg, towards the\r\nfleet.  On overhauling the boat they found a small white flag, not much\r\nlarger than a handkerchief, set up in the stern, no doubt intended as a\r\nflag of truce in case of discovery.  The boat, crew and passengers were\r\nbrought ashore to me.  The chief personage aboard proved to be Jacob\r\nThompson, Secretary of the Interior under the administration of\r\nPresident Buchanan.  After a pleasant conversation of half an hour or\r\nmore I allowed the boat and crew, passengers and all, to return to\r\nVicksburg, without creating a suspicion that there was a doubt in my\r\nmind as to the good faith of Mr. Thompson and his flag.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Porter proceeded with the preparation of the steamers for their\r\nhazardous passage of the enemy's batteries.  The great essential was to\r\nprotect the boilers from the enemy's shot, and to conceal the fires\r\nunder the boilers from view.  This he accomplished by loading the\r\nsteamers, between the guards and boilers on the boiler deck up to the\r\ndeck above, with bales of hay and cotton, and the deck in front of the\r\nboilers in the same way, adding sacks of grain.  The hay and grain would\r\nbe wanted below, and could not be transported in sufficient quantity by\r\nthe muddy roads over which we expected to march.\r\n\r\nBefore this I had been collecting, from St. Louis and Chicago, yawls and\r\nbarges to be used as ferries when we got below.  By the 16th of April\r\nPorter was ready to start on his perilous trip.  The advance, flagship\r\nBenton, Porter commanding, started at ten o'clock at night, followed at\r\nintervals of a few minutes by the Lafayette with a captured steamer, the\r\nPrice, lashed to her side, the Louisville, Mound City, Pittsburgh and\r\nCarondelet--all of these being naval vessels.  Next came the transports\r\n--Forest Queen, Silver Wave and Henry Clay, each towing barges loaded\r\nwith coal to be used as fuel by the naval and transport steamers when\r\nbelow the batteries.  The gunboat Tuscumbia brought up the rear.  Soon\r\nafter the start a battery between Vicksburg and Warrenton opened fire\r\nacross the intervening peninsula, followed by the upper batteries, and\r\nthen by batteries all along the line.  The gunboats ran up close under\r\nthe bluffs, delivering their fire in return at short distances, probably\r\nwithout much effect.  They were under fire for more than two hours and\r\nevery vessel was struck many times, but with little damage to the\r\ngunboats.  The transports did not fare so well.  The Henry Clay was\r\ndisabled and deserted by her crew. Soon after a shell burst in the\r\ncotton packed about the boilers, set the vessel on fire and burned her\r\nto the water's edge.  The burning mass, however, floated down to\r\nCarthage before grounding, as did also one of the barges in tow.\r\n\r\nThe enemy were evidently expecting our fleet, for they were ready to\r\nlight up the river by means of bonfires on the east side and by firing\r\nhouses on the point of land opposite the city on the Louisiana side.\r\nThe sight was magnificent, but terrible.  I witnessed it from the deck\r\nof a river transport, run out into the middle of the river and as low\r\ndown as it was prudent to go.  My mind was much relieved when I learned\r\nthat no one on the transports had been killed and but few, if any,\r\nwounded.  During the running of the batteries men were stationed in the\r\nholds of the transports to partially stop with cotton shot-holes that\r\nmight be made in the hulls.  All damage was afterwards soon repaired\r\nunder the direction of Admiral Porter.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of passing batteries had been tried before this, however,\r\nduring the war.  Admiral Farragut had run the batteries at Port Hudson\r\nwith the flagship Hartford and one iron-clad and visited me from below\r\nVicksburg.  The 13th of February Admiral Porter had sent the gunboat\r\nIndianola, Lieutenant-Commander George Brown commanding, below.  She met\r\nColonel Ellet of the Marine brigade below Natchez on a captured steamer.\r\nTwo of the Colonel's fleet had previously run the batteries, producing\r\nthe greatest consternation among the people along the Mississippi from\r\nVicksburg (*10) to the Red River.\r\n\r\nThe Indianola remained about the mouth of the Red River some days, and\r\nthen started up the Mississippi.  The Confederates soon raised the Queen\r\nof the West, (*11) and repaired her.  With this vessel and the ram Webb,\r\nwhich they had had for some time in the Red River, and two other\r\nsteamers, they followed the Indianola. The latter was encumbered with\r\nbarges of coal in tow, and consequently could make but little speed\r\nagainst the rapid current of the Mississippi.  The Confederate fleet\r\novertook her just above Grand Gulf, and attacked her after dark on the\r\n24th of February.  The Indianola was superior to all the others in\r\narmament, and probably would have destroyed them or driven them away,\r\nbut for her encumbrance.  As it was she fought them for an hour and a\r\nhalf, but, in the dark, was struck seven or eight times by the ram and\r\nother vessels, and was finally disabled and reduced to a sinking\r\ncondition.  The armament was thrown overboard and the vessel run ashore.\r\nOfficers and crew then surrendered.\r\n\r\nI had started McClernand with his corps of four divisions on the 29th of\r\nMarch, by way of Richmond, Louisiana, to New Carthage, hoping that he\r\nmight capture Grand Gulf before the balance of the troops could get\r\nthere; but the roads were very bad, scarcely above water yet.  Some\r\nmiles from New Carthage the levee to Bayou Vidal was broken in several\r\nplaces, overflowing the roads for the distance of two miles.  Boats were\r\ncollected from the surrounding bayous, and some constructed on the spot\r\nfrom such material as could be collected, to transport the troops across\r\nthe overflowed interval.  By the 6th of April McClernand had reached New\r\nCarthage with one division and its artillery, the latter ferried through\r\nthe woods by these boats.  On the 17th I visited New Carthage in person,\r\nand saw that the process of getting troops through in the way we were\r\ndoing was so tedious that a better method must be devised.  The water\r\nwas falling, and in a few days there would not be depth enough to use\r\nboats; nor would the land be dry enough to march over.  McClernand had\r\nalready found a new route from Smith's plantation where the crevasse\r\noccurred, to Perkins' plantation, eight to twelve miles below New\r\nCarthage.  This increased the march from Milliken's Bend from\r\ntwenty-seven to nearly forty miles.  Four bridges had to be built across\r\nbayous, two of them each over six hundred feet long, making about two\r\nthousand feet of bridging in all.  The river falling made the current in\r\nthese bayous very rapid, increasing the difficulty of building and\r\npermanently fastening these bridges; but the ingenuity of the \"Yankee\r\nsoldier\" was equal to any emergency.  The bridges were soon built of\r\nsuch material as could be found near by, and so substantial were they\r\nthat not a single mishap occurred in crossing all the army with\r\nartillery, cavalry and wagon trains, except the loss of one siege gun\r\n(a thirty-two pounder).  This, if my memory serves me correctly, broke\r\nthrough the only pontoon bridge we had in all our march across the\r\npeninsula. These bridges were all built by McClernand's command, under\r\nthe supervision of Lieutenant Hains of the Engineer Corps.\r\n\r\nI returned to Milliken's Bend on the 18th or 19th, and on the 20th\r\nissued the following final order for the movement of troops:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE, MILLIKEN'S BEND, LOUISIANA,\r\nApril 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nSpecial Orders, No. 110. *         *         *         *         * *\r\n* VIII.  The following orders are published for the information and\r\nguidance of the \"Army in the Field,\" in its present movement to obtain a\r\nfoothold on the east bank of the Mississippi River, from which Vicksburg\r\ncan be approached by practicable roads.\r\n\r\nFirst.--The Thirteenth army corps, Major-General John A. McClernand\r\ncommanding, will constitute the right wing.\r\n\r\nSecond.--The Fifteenth army corps, Major-General W. T. Sherman\r\ncommanding, will constitute the left wing.\r\n\r\nThird.--The Seventeenth army corps, Major-General James B. McPherson\r\ncommanding, will constitute the centre.\r\n\r\nFourth.--The order of march to New Carthage will be from right to left.\r\n\r\nFifth.--Reserves will be formed by divisions from each army corps; or,\r\nan entire army corps will be held as a reserve, as necessity may\r\nrequire.  When the reserve is formed by divisions, each division will\r\nremain under the immediate command of its respective corps commander,\r\nunless otherwise specially ordered for a particular emergency.\r\n\r\nSixth.--Troops will be required to bivouac, until proper facilities can\r\nbe afforded for the transportation of camp equipage.\r\n\r\nSeventh.--In the present movement, one tent will be allowed to each\r\ncompany for the protection of rations from rain; one wall tent for each\r\nregimental headquarters; one wall tent for each brigade headquarters;\r\nand one wall tent for each division headquarters; corps commanders\r\nhaving the books and blanks of their respective commands to provide for,\r\nare authorized to take such tents as are absolutely necessary, but not\r\nto exceed the number allowed by General Orders No. 160, A. G. O., series\r\nof 1862.\r\n\r\nEighth.--All the teams of the three army corps, under the immediate\r\ncharge of the quartermasters bearing them on their returns, will\r\nconstitute a train for carrying supplies and ordnance and the authorized\r\ncamp equipage of the army.\r\n\r\nNinth.--As fast as the Thirteenth army corps advances, the Seventeenth\r\narmy corps will take its place; and it, in turn, will be followed in\r\nlike manner by the Fifteenth army corps.\r\n\r\nTenth.--Two regiments from each army corps will be detailed by corps\r\ncommanders, to guard the lines from Richmond to New Carthage.\r\n\r\nEleventh.--General hospitals will be established by the medical director\r\nbetween Duckport and Milliken's Bend.  All sick and disabled soldiers\r\nwill be left in these hospitals.  Surgeons in charge of hospitals will\r\nreport convalescents as fast as they become fit for duty.  Each corps\r\ncommander will detail an intelligent and good drill officer, to remain\r\nbehind and take charge of the convalescents of their respective corps;\r\nofficers so detailed will organize the men under their charge into\r\nsquads and companies, without regard to the regiments they belong to;\r\nand in the absence of convalescent commissioned officers to command\r\nthem, will appoint non-commissioned officers or privates.  The force so\r\norganized will constitute the guard of the line from Duckport to\r\nMilliken's Bend.  They will furnish all the guards and details required\r\nfor general hospitals, and with the contrabands that may be about the\r\ncamps, will furnish all the details for loading and unloading boats.\r\n\r\nTwelfth.--The movement of troops from Milliken's Bend to New Carthage\r\nwill be so conducted as to allow the transportation of ten days' supply\r\nof rations, and one-half the allowance of ordnance, required by previous\r\norders.\r\n\r\nThirteenth.--Commanders are authorized and enjoined to collect all the\r\nbeef cattle, corn and other necessary supplies on the line of march; but\r\nwanton destruction of property, taking of articles useless for military\r\npurposes, insulting citizens, going into and searching houses without\r\nproper orders from division commanders, are positively prohibited.  All\r\nsuch irregularities must be summarily punished.\r\n\r\nFourteenth.--Brigadier-General J. C.  Sullivan is appointed to the\r\ncommand of all the forces detailed for the protection of the line from\r\nhere to New Carthage.  His particular attention is called to General\r\nOrders, No. 69, from Adjutant-General's Office, Washington, of date\r\nMarch 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nBy order of MAJOR-GENERAL U. S.  GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcClernand was already below on the Mississippi.  Two of McPherson's\r\ndivisions were put upon the march immediately.  The third had not yet\r\narrived from Lake Providence; it was on its way to Milliken's Bend and\r\nwas to follow on arrival.\r\n\r\nSherman was to follow McPherson.  Two of his divisions were at Duckport\r\nand Young's Point, and the third under Steele was under orders to return\r\nfrom Greenville, Mississippi, where it had been sent to expel a rebel\r\nbattery that had been annoying our transports.\r\n\r\nIt had now become evident that the army could not be rationed by a wagon\r\ntrain over the single narrow and almost impassable road between\r\nMilliken's Bend and Perkins' plantation.  Accordingly six more steamers\r\nwere protected as before, to run the batteries, and were loaded with\r\nsupplies.  They took twelve barges in tow, loaded also with rations.  On\r\nthe night of the 22d of April they ran the batteries, five getting\r\nthrough more or less disabled while one was sunk.  About half the barges\r\ngot through with their needed freight.\r\n\r\nWhen it was first proposed to run the blockade at Vicksburg with river\r\nsteamers there were but two captains or masters who were willing to\r\naccompany their vessels, and but one crew. Volunteers were called for\r\nfrom the army, men who had had experience in any capacity in navigating\r\nthe western rivers. Captains, pilots, mates, engineers and deck-hands\r\nenough presented themselves to take five times the number of vessels we\r\nwere moving through this dangerous ordeal.  Most of them were from\r\nLogan's division, composed generally of men from the southern part of\r\nIllinois and from Missouri.  All but two of the steamers were commanded\r\nby volunteers from the army, and all but one so manned.  In this\r\ninstance, as in all others during the war, I found that volunteers could\r\nbe found in the ranks and among the commissioned officers to meet every\r\ncall for aid whether mechanical or professional.  Colonel W. S. Oliver\r\nwas master of transportation on this occasion by special detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nATTACK ON GRAND GULF--OPERATIONS BELOW VICKSBURG.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th my headquarters were with the advance at Perkins'\r\nplantation.  Reconnoissances were made in boats to ascertain whether\r\nthere was high land on the east shore of the river where we might land\r\nabove Grand Gulf.  There was none practicable. Accordingly the troops\r\nwere set in motion for Hard Times, twenty-two miles farther down the\r\nriver and nearly opposite Grand Gulf.  The loss of two steamers and six\r\nbarges reduced our transportation so that only 10,000 men could be moved\r\nby water. Some of the steamers that had got below were injured in their\r\nmachinery, so that they were only useful as barges towed by those less\r\nseverely injured.  All the troops, therefore, except what could be\r\ntransported in one trip, had to march.  The road lay west of Lake St.\r\nJoseph.  Three large bayous had to be crossed.  They were rapidly\r\nbridged in the same manner as those previously encountered. (*12)\r\n\r\nOn the 27th McClernand's corps was all at Hard Times, and McPherson's\r\nwas following closely.  I had determined to make the attempt to effect a\r\nlanding on the east side of the river as soon as possible.  Accordingly,\r\non the morning of the 29th, McClernand was directed to embark all the\r\ntroops from his corps that our transports and barges could carry.  About\r\n10,000 men were so embarked.  The plan was to have the navy silence the\r\nguns at Grand Gulf, and to have as many men as possible ready to debark\r\nin the shortest possible time under cover of the fire of the navy and\r\ncarry the works by storm.  The following order was issued:\r\n\r\nPERKINS PLANTATION, LA., April 27,1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL J. A. MCCLERNAND, Commanding 13th A. C.\r\n\r\nCommence immediately the embarkation of your corps, or so much of it as\r\nthere is transportation for.  Have put aboard the artillery and every\r\narticle authorized in orders limiting baggage, except the men, and hold\r\nthem in readiness, with their places assigned, to be moved at a moment's\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\nAll the troops you may have, except those ordered to remain behind, send\r\nto a point nearly opposite Grand Gulf, where you see, by special orders\r\nof this date, General McPherson is ordered to send one division.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the attack will be for the navy to attack and silence all\r\nthe batteries commanding the river.  Your corps will be on the river,\r\nready to run to and debark on the nearest eligible land below the\r\npromontory first brought to view passing down the river.  Once on shore,\r\nhave each commander instructed beforehand to form his men the best the\r\nground will admit of, and take possession of the most commanding points,\r\nbut avoid separating your command so that it cannot support itself.  The\r\nfirst object is to get a foothold where our troops can maintain\r\nthemselves until such time as preparations can be made and troops\r\ncollected for a forward movement.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Porter has proposed to place his boats in the position indicated\r\nto you a few days ago, and to bring over with them such troops as may be\r\nbelow the city after the guns of the enemy are silenced.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the enemy will occupy positions back from the city, out\r\nof range of the gunboats, so as to make it desirable to run past Grand\r\nGulf and land at Rodney.  In case this should prove the plan, a signal\r\nwill be arranged and you duly informed, when the transports are to start\r\nwith this view.  Or, it may be expedient for the boats to run past, but\r\nnot the men.  In this case, then, the transports would have to be\r\nbrought back to where the men could land and move by forced marches to\r\nbelow Grand Gulf, re-embark rapidly and proceed to the latter place.\r\nThere will be required, then, three signals; one, to indicate that the\r\ntransports can run down and debark the troops at Grand Gulf; one, that\r\nthe transports can run by without the troops; and the last, that the\r\ntransports can run by with the troops on board.\r\n\r\nShould the men have to march, all baggage and artillery will be left to\r\nrun the blockade.\r\n\r\nIf not already directed, require your men to keep three days' rations in\r\ntheir haversacks, not to be touched until a movement commences.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 8 o'clock A.M., 29th, Porter made the attack with his entire strength\r\npresent, eight gunboats.  For nearly five and a half hours the attack\r\nwas kept up without silencing a single gun of the enemy.  All this time\r\nMcClernand's 10,000 men were huddled together on the transports in the\r\nstream ready to attempt a landing if signalled.  I occupied a tug from\r\nwhich I could see the effect of the battle on both sides, within range\r\nof the enemy's guns; but a small tug, without armament, was not\r\ncalculated to attract the fire of batteries while they were being\r\nassailed themselves.  About half-past one the fleet withdrew, seeing\r\ntheir efforts were entirely unavailing.  The enemy ceased firing as soon\r\nas we withdrew.  I immediately signalled the Admiral and went aboard his\r\nship.  The navy lost in this engagement eighteen killed and fifty-six\r\nwounded.  A large proportion of these were of the crew of the flagship,\r\nand most of those from a single shell which penetrated the ship's side\r\nand exploded between decks where the men were working their guns.  The\r\nsight of the mangled and dying men which met my eye as I boarded the\r\nship was sickening.\r\n\r\nGrand Gulf is on a high bluff where the river runs at the very foot of\r\nit.  It is as defensible upon its front as Vicksburg and, at that time,\r\nwould have been just as impossible to capture by a front attack.  I\r\ntherefore requested Porter to run the batteries with his fleet that\r\nnight, and to take charge of the transports, all of which would be\r\nwanted below.\r\n\r\nThere is a long tongue of land from the Louisiana side extending towards\r\nGrand Gulf, made by the river running nearly east from about three miles\r\nabove and nearly in the opposite direction from that point for about the\r\nsame distance below.  The land was so low and wet that it would not have\r\nbeen practicable to march an army across but for a levee.  I had had\r\nthis explored before, as well as the east bank below to ascertain if\r\nthere was a possible point of debarkation north of Rodney.  It was found\r\nthat the top of the levee afforded a good road to march upon.\r\n\r\nPorter, as was always the case with him, not only acquiesced in the\r\nplan, but volunteered to use his entire fleet as transports.  I had\r\nintended to make this request, but he anticipated me.  At dusk, when\r\nconcealed from the view of the enemy at Grand Gulf, McClernand landed\r\nhis command on the west bank.  The navy and transports ran the batteries\r\nsuccessfully. The troops marched across the point of land under cover of\r\nnight, unobserved.  By the time it was light the enemy saw our whole\r\nfleet, ironclads, gunboats, river steamers and barges, quietly moving\r\ndown the river three miles below them, black, or rather blue, with\r\nNational troops.\r\n\r\nWhen the troops debarked, the evening of the 29th, it was expected that\r\nwe would have to go to Rodney, about nine miles below, to find a\r\nlanding; but that night a colored man came in who informed me that a\r\ngood landing would be found at Bruinsburg, a few miles above Rodney,\r\nfrom which point there was a good road leading to Port Gibson some\r\ntwelve miles in the interior.  The information was found correct, and\r\nour landing was effected without opposition.\r\n\r\nSherman had not left his position above Vicksburg yet.  On the morning\r\nof the 27th I ordered him to create a diversion by moving his corps up\r\nthe Yazoo and threatening an attack on Haines' Bluff.\r\n\r\nMy object was to compel Pemberton to keep as much force about Vicksburg\r\nas I could, until I could secure a good footing on high land east of the\r\nriver.  The move was eminently successful and, as we afterwards learned,\r\ncreated great confusion about Vicksburg and doubts about our real\r\ndesign.  Sherman moved the day of our attack on Grand Gulf, the 29th,\r\nwith ten regiments of his command and eight gunboats which Porter had\r\nleft above Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nHe debarked his troops and apparently made every preparation to attack\r\nthe enemy while the navy bombarded the main forts at Haines' Bluff.\r\nThis move was made without a single casualty in either branch of the\r\nservice.  On the first of May Sherman received orders from me (sent from\r\nHard Times the evening of the 29th of April) to withdraw from the front\r\nof Haines' Bluff and follow McPherson with two divisions as fast as he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nI had established a depot of supplies at Perkins' plantation. Now that\r\nall our gunboats were below Grand Gulf it was possible that the enemy\r\nmight fit out boats in the Big Black with improvised armament and\r\nattempt to destroy these supplies. McPherson was at Hard Times with a\r\nportion of his corps, and the depot was protected by a part of his\r\ncommand.  The night of the 29th I directed him to arm one of the\r\ntransports with artillery and send it up to Perkins' plantation as a\r\nguard; and also to have the siege guns we had brought along moved there\r\nand put in position.\r\n\r\nThe embarkation below Grand Gulf took place at De Shroon's, Louisiana,\r\nsix miles above Bruinsburg, Mississippi.  Early on the morning of 30th\r\nof April McClernand's corps and one division of McPherson's corps were\r\nspeedily landed.\r\n\r\nWhen this was effected I felt a degree of relief scarcely ever equalled\r\nsince.  Vicksburg was not yet taken it is true, nor were its defenders\r\ndemoralized by any of our previous moves.  I was now in the enemy's\r\ncountry, with a vast river and the stronghold of Vicksburg between me\r\nand my base of supplies.  But I was on dry ground on the same side of\r\nthe river with the enemy.  All the campaigns, labors, hardships and\r\nexposures from the month of December previous to this time that had been\r\nmade and endured, were for the accomplishment of this one object.\r\n\r\nI had with me the 13th corps, General McClernand commanding, and two\r\nbrigades of Logan's division of the 17th corps, General McPherson\r\ncommanding--in all not more than twenty thousand men to commence the\r\ncampaign with.  These were soon reinforced by the remaining brigade of\r\nLogan's division and Crocker's division of the 17th corps.  On the 7th\r\nof May I was further reinforced by Sherman with two divisions of his,\r\nthe 15th corps.  My total force was then about thirty-three thousand\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe enemy occupied Grand Gulf, Haines' Bluff and Jackson with a force of\r\nnearly sixty thousand men.  Jackson is fifty miles east of Vicksburg and\r\nis connected with it by a railroad.  My first problem was to capture\r\nGrand Gulf to use as a base.\r\n\r\nBruinsburg is two miles from high ground.  The bottom at that point is\r\nhigher than most of the low land in the valley of the Mississippi, and a\r\ngood road leads to the bluff.  It was natural to expect the garrison\r\nfrom Grand Gulf to come out to meet us and prevent, if they could, our\r\nreaching this solid base.  Bayou Pierre enters the Mississippi just\r\nabove Bruinsburg and, as it is a navigable stream and was high at the\r\ntime, in order to intercept us they had to go by Port Gibson, the\r\nnearest point where there was a bridge to cross upon.  This more than\r\ndoubled the distance from Grand Gulf to the high land back of\r\nBruinsburg.  No time was to be lost in securing this foothold. Our\r\ntransportation was not sufficient to move all the army across the river\r\nat one trip, or even two; but the landing of the 13th corps and one\r\ndivision of the 17th was effected during the day, April 30th, and early\r\nevening.  McClernand was advanced as soon as ammunition and two days'\r\nrations (to last five) could be issued to his men.  The bluffs were\r\nreached an hour before sunset and McClernand was pushed on, hoping to\r\nreach Port Gibson and save the bridge spanning the Bayou Pierre before\r\nthe enemy could get there; for crossing a stream in the presence of an\r\nenemy is always difficult.  Port Gibson, too, is the starting point of\r\nroads to Grand Gulf, Vicksburg and Jackson.\r\n\r\nMcClernand's advance met the enemy about five miles west of Port Gibson\r\nat Thompson's plantation.  There was some firing during the night, but\r\nnothing rising to the dignity of a battle until daylight.  The enemy had\r\ntaken a strong natural position with most of the Grand Gulf garrison,\r\nnumbering about seven or eight thousand men, under General Bowen.  His\r\nhope was to hold me in check until reinforcements under Loring could\r\nreach him from Vicksburg; but Loring did not come in time to render much\r\nassistance south of Port Gibson.  Two brigades of McPherson's corps\r\nfollowed McClernand as fast as rations and ammunition could be issued,\r\nand were ready to take position upon the battlefield whenever the 13th\r\ncorps could be got out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe country in this part of Mississippi stands on edge, as it were, the\r\nroads running along the ridges except when they occasionally pass from\r\none ridge to another.  Where there are no clearings the sides of the\r\nhills are covered with a very heavy growth of timber and with\r\nundergrowth, and the ravines are filled with vines and canebrakes,\r\nalmost impenetrable.  This makes it easy for an inferior force to delay,\r\nif not defeat, a far superior one.\r\n\r\nNear the point selected by Bowen to defend, the road to Port Gibson\r\ndivides, taking two ridges which do not diverge more than a mile or two\r\nat the widest point.  These roads unite just outside the town.  This\r\nmade it necessary for McClernand to divide his force.  It was not only\r\ndivided, but it was separated by a deep ravine of the character above\r\ndescribed.  One flank could not reinforce the other except by marching\r\nback to the junction of the roads.  McClernand put the divisions of\r\nHovey, Carr and A. J. Smith upon the right-hand branch and Osterhaus on\r\nthe left.  I was on the field by ten A.M., and inspected both flanks in\r\nperson.  On the right the enemy, if not being pressed back, was at least\r\nnot repulsing our advance.  On the left, however, Osterhaus was not\r\nfaring so well.  He had been repulsed with some loss.  As soon as the\r\nroad could be cleared of McClernand's troops I ordered up McPherson, who\r\nwas close upon the rear of the 13th corps, with two brigades of Logan's\r\ndivision.  This was about noon.  I ordered him to send one brigade\r\n(General John E. Smith's was selected) to support Osterhaus, and to move\r\nto the left and flank the enemy out of his position.  This movement\r\ncarried the brigade over a deep ravine to a third ridge and, when\r\nSmith's troops were seen well through the ravine, Osterhaus was directed\r\nto renew his front attack.  It was successful and unattended by heavy\r\nloss.  The enemy was sent in full retreat on their right, and their left\r\nfollowed before sunset.  While the movement to our left was going on,\r\nMcClernand, who was with his right flank, sent me frequent requests for\r\nreinforcements, although the force with him was not being pressed.  I\r\nhad been upon the ground and knew it did not admit of his engaging all\r\nthe men he had.  We followed up our victory until night overtook us\r\nabout two miles from Port Gibson; then the troops went into bivouac for\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF PORT GIBSON--GRIERSON'S RAID--OCCUPATION OF GRAND GULF\r\n--MOVEMENT UP THE BIG BLACK--BATTLE OF RAYMOND.\r\n\r\nWe started next morning for Port Gibson as soon as it was light enough\r\nto see the road.  We were soon in the town, and I was delighted to find\r\nthat the enemy had not stopped to contest our crossing further at the\r\nbridge, which he had burned.  The troops were set to work at once to\r\nconstruct a bridge across the South Fork of the Bayou Pierre.  At this\r\ntime the water was high and the current rapid.  What might be called a\r\nraft-bridge was soon constructed from material obtained from wooden\r\nbuildings, stables, fences, etc., which sufficed for carrying the whole\r\narmy over safely.  Colonel J. H. Wilson, a member of my staff, planned\r\nand superintended the construction of this bridge, going into the water\r\nand working as hard as any one engaged.  Officers and men generally\r\njoined in this work.  When it was finished the army crossed and marched\r\neight miles beyond to the North Fork that day.  One brigade of Logan's\r\ndivision was sent down the stream to occupy the attention of a rebel\r\nbattery, which had been left behind with infantry supports to prevent\r\nour repairing the burnt railroad bridge.  Two of his brigades were sent\r\nup the bayou to find a crossing and reach the North Fork to repair the\r\nbridge there.  The enemy soon left when he found we were building a\r\nbridge elsewhere.  Before leaving Port Gibson we were reinforced by\r\nCrocker's division, McPherson's corps, which had crossed the Mississippi\r\nat Bruinsburg and come up without stopping except to get two days'\r\nrations.  McPherson still had one division west of the Mississippi\r\nRiver, guarding the road from Milliken's Bend to the river below until\r\nSherman's command should relieve it.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Bruinsburg for the front I left my son Frederick, who had\r\njoined me a few weeks before, on board one of the gunboats asleep, and\r\nhoped to get away without him until after Grand Gulf should fall into\r\nour hands; but on waking up he learned that I had gone, and being guided\r\nby the sound of the battle raging at Thompson's Hill--called the Battle\r\nof Port Gibson--found his way to where I was.  He had no horse to ride\r\nat the time, and I had no facilities for even preparing a meal.  He,\r\ntherefore, foraged around the best he could until we reached Grand Gulf.\r\nMr. C. A. Dana, then an officer of the War Department, accompanied me on\r\nthe Vicksburg campaign and through a portion of the siege.  He was in\r\nthe same situation as Fred so far as transportation and mess\r\narrangements were concerned.  The first time I call to mind seeing\r\neither of them, after the battle, they were mounted on two enormous\r\nhorses, grown white from age, each equipped with dilapidated saddles and\r\nbridles.\r\n\r\nOur trains arrived a few days later, after which we were all perfectly\r\nequipped.\r\n\r\nMy son accompanied me throughout the campaign and siege, and caused no\r\nanxiety either to me or to his mother, who was at home.  He looked out\r\nfor himself and was in every battle of the campaign.  His age, then not\r\nquite thirteen, enabled him to take in all he saw, and to retain a\r\nrecollection of it that would not be possible in more mature years.\r\n\r\nWhen the movement from Bruinsburg commenced we were without a wagon\r\ntrain.  The train still west of the Mississippi was carried around with\r\nproper escort, by a circuitous route from Milliken's Bend to Hard Times\r\nseventy or more miles below, and did not get up for some days after the\r\nbattle of Port Gibson. My own horses, headquarters' transportation,\r\nservants, mess chest, and everything except what I had on, was with this\r\ntrain. General A. J. Smith happened to have an extra horse at Bruinsburg\r\nwhich I borrowed, with a saddle-tree without upholstering further than\r\nstirrups.  I had no other for nearly a week.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to have transportation for ammunition. Provisions could\r\nbe taken from the country; but all the ammunition that can be carried on\r\nthe person is soon exhausted when there is much fighting.  I directed,\r\ntherefore, immediately on landing that all the vehicles and draft\r\nanimals, whether horses, mules, or oxen, in the vicinity should be\r\ncollected and loaded to their capacity with ammunition.  Quite a train\r\nwas collected during the 30th, and a motley train it was.  In it could\r\nbe found fine carriages, loaded nearly to the top with boxes of\r\ncartridges that had been pitched in promiscuously, drawn by mules with\r\nplough, harness, straw collars, rope-lines, etc.; long-coupled wagons,\r\nwith racks for carrying cotton bales, drawn by oxen, and everything that\r\ncould be found in the way of transportation on a plantation, either for\r\nuse or pleasure.  The making out of provision returns was stopped for\r\nthe time.  No formalities were to retard our progress until a position\r\nwas secured when the time could be spared to observe them.\r\n\r\nIt was at Port Gibson I first heard through a Southern paper of the\r\ncomplete success of Colonel Grierson, who was making a raid through\r\ncentral Mississippi.  He had started from La Grange April 17th with\r\nthree regiments of about 1,700 men.  On the 21st he had detached Colonel\r\nHatch with one regiment to destroy the railroad between Columbus and\r\nMacon and then return to La Grange.  Hatch had a sharp fight with the\r\nenemy at Columbus and retreated along the railroad, destroying it at\r\nOkalona and Tupelo, and arriving in La Grange April 26.  Grierson\r\ncontinued his movement with about 1,000 men, breaking the Vicksburg and\r\nMeridian railroad and the New Orleans and Jackson railroad, arriving at\r\nBaton Rouge May 2d.  This raid was of great importance, for Grierson had\r\nattracted the attention of the enemy from the main movement against\r\nVicksburg.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 2d of May the bridge over the North Fork was\r\nrepaired, and the troops commenced crossing at five the next morning.\r\nBefore the leading brigade was over it was fired upon by the enemy from\r\na commanding position; but they were soon driven off.  It was evident\r\nthat the enemy was covering a retreat from Grand Gulf to Vicksburg.\r\nEvery commanding position from this (Grindstone) crossing to Hankinson's\r\nferry over the Big Black was occupied by the retreating foe to delay our\r\nprogress. McPherson, however, reached Hankinson's ferry before night,\r\nseized the ferry boat, and sent a detachment of his command across and\r\nseveral miles north on the road to Vicksburg.  When the junction of the\r\nroad going to Vicksburg with the road from Grand Gulf to Raymond and\r\nJackson was reached, Logan with his division was turned to the left\r\ntowards Grand Gulf.  I went with him a short distance from this\r\njunction.  McPherson had encountered the largest force yet met since the\r\nbattle of Port Gibson and had a skirmish nearly approaching a battle;\r\nbut the road Logan had taken enabled him to come up on the enemy's right\r\nflank, and they soon gave way.  McPherson was ordered to hold\r\nHankinson's ferry and the road back to Willow Springs with one division;\r\nMcClernand, who was now in the rear, was to join in this as well as to\r\nguard the line back down the bayou.  I did not want to take the chances\r\nof having an enemy lurking in our rear.\r\n\r\nOn the way from the junction to Grand Gulf, where the road comes into\r\nthe one from Vicksburg to the same place six or seven miles out, I\r\nlearned that the last of the enemy had retreated past that place on\r\ntheir way to Vicksburg.  I left Logan to make the proper disposition of\r\nhis troops for the night, while I rode into the town with an escort of\r\nabout twenty cavalry.  Admiral Porter had already arrived with his\r\nfleet.  The enemy had abandoned his heavy guns and evacuated the place.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached Grand Gulf May 3d I had not been with my baggage since\r\nthe 27th of April and consequently had had no change of underclothing,\r\nno meal except such as I could pick up sometimes at other headquarters,\r\nand no tent to cover me.  The first thing I did was to get a bath,\r\nborrow some fresh underclothing from one of the naval officers and\r\nget a good meal on the flag-ship.  Then I wrote letters to the\r\ngeneral-in-chief informing him of our present position, dispatches to be\r\ntelegraphed from Cairo, orders to General Sullivan commanding above\r\nVicksburg, and gave orders to all my corps commanders.  About twelve\r\no'clock at night I was through my work and started for Hankinson's\r\nferry, arriving there before daylight.  While at Grand Gulf I heard from\r\nBanks, who was on the Red River, and who said that he could not be at\r\nPort Hudson before the 10th of May and then with only 15,000 men.  Up to\r\nthis time my intention had been to secure Grand Gulf, as a base of\r\nsupplies, detach McClernand's corps to Banks and co-operate with him in\r\nthe reduction of Port Hudson.\r\n\r\nThe news from Banks forced upon me a different plan of campaign from the\r\none intended.  To wait for his co-operation would have detained me at\r\nleast a month.  The reinforcements would not have reached ten thousand\r\nmen after deducting casualties and necessary river guards at all high\r\npoints close to the river for over three hundred miles.  The enemy would\r\nhave strengthened his position and been reinforced by more men than\r\nBanks could have brought. I therefore determined to move independently\r\nof Banks, cut loose from my base, destroy the rebel force in rear of\r\nVicksburg and invest or capture the city.\r\n\r\nGrand Gulf was accordingly given up as a base and the authorities at\r\nWashington were notified.  I knew well that Halleck's caution would lead\r\nhim to disapprove of this course; but it was the only one that gave any\r\nchance of success.  The time it would take to communicate with\r\nWashington and get a reply would be so great that I could not be\r\ninterfered with until it was demonstrated whether my plan was\r\npracticable.  Even Sherman, who afterwards ignored bases of supplies\r\nother than what were afforded by the country while marching through four\r\nStates of the Confederacy with an army more than twice as large as mine\r\nat this time, wrote me from Hankinson's ferry, advising me of the\r\nimpossibility of supplying our army over a single road.  He urged me to\r\n\"stop all troops till your army is partially supplied with wagons, and\r\nthen act as quick as possible; for this road will be jammed, as sure as\r\nlife.\"  To this I replied:  \"I do not calculate upon the possibility of\r\nsupplying the army with full rations from Grand Gulf.  I know it will be\r\nimpossible without constructing additional roads.  What I do expect is\r\nto get up what rations of hard bread, coffee and salt we can, and make\r\nthe country furnish the balance.\"  We started from Bruinsburg with an\r\naverage of about two days' rations, and received no more from our own\r\nsupplies for some days; abundance was found in the mean time.  A delay\r\nwould give the enemy time to reinforce and fortify.\r\n\r\nMcClernand's and McPherson's commands were kept substantially as they\r\nwere on the night of the 2d, awaiting supplies sufficient to give them\r\nthree days' rations in haversacks.  Beef, mutton, poultry and forage\r\nwere found in abundance.  Quite a quantity of bacon and molasses was\r\nalso secured from the country, but bread and coffee could not be\r\nobtained in quantity sufficient for all the men.  Every plantation,\r\nhowever, had a run of stone, propelled by mule power, to grind corn for\r\nthe owners and their slaves.  All these were kept running while we were\r\nstopping, day and night, and when we were marching, during the night, at\r\nall plantations covered by the troops.  But the product was taken by the\r\ntroops nearest by, so that the majority of the command was destined to\r\ngo without bread until a new base was established on the Yazoo above\r\nVicksburg.\r\n\r\nWhile the troops were awaiting the arrival of rations I ordered\r\nreconnoissances made by McClernand and McPherson, with the view of\r\nleading the enemy to believe that we intended to cross the Big Black and\r\nattack the city at once.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th Sherman arrived at Grand Gulf and crossed his command that\r\nnight and the next day.  Three days' rations had been brought up from\r\nGrand Gulf for the advanced troops and were issued.  Orders were given\r\nfor a forward movement the next day.  Sherman was directed to order up\r\nBlair, who had been left behind to guard the road from Milliken's Bend\r\nto Hard Times with two brigades.\r\n\r\nThe quartermaster at Young's Point was ordered to send two hundred\r\nwagons with Blair, and the commissary was to load them with hard bread,\r\ncoffee, sugar, salt and one hundred thousand pounds of salt meat.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d Hurlbut, who had been left at Memphis, was ordered to send\r\nfour regiments from his command to Milliken's Bend to relieve Blair's\r\ndivision, and on the 5th he was ordered to send Lauman's division in\r\naddition, the latter to join the army in the field.  The four regiments\r\nwere to be taken from troops near the river so that there would be no\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 6th McPherson drew in his troops north of the\r\nBig Black and was off at an early hour on the road to Jackson, via Rocky\r\nSprings, Utica and Raymond.  That night he and McClernand were both at\r\nRocky Springs ten miles from Hankinson's ferry.  McPherson remained\r\nthere during the 8th, while McClernand moved to Big Sandy and Sherman\r\nmarched from Grand Gulf to Hankinson's ferry.  The 9th, McPherson moved\r\nto a point within a few miles west of Utica; McClernand and Sherman\r\nremained where they were.  On the 10th McPherson moved to Utica, Sherman\r\nto Big Sandy; McClernand was still at Big Sandy.  The 11th, McClernand\r\nwas at Five Mile Creek; Sherman at Auburn; McPherson five miles advanced\r\nfrom Utica. May 12th, McClernand was at Fourteen Mile Creek; Sherman at\r\nFourteen Mile Creek; McPherson at Raymond after a battle.\r\n\r\nAfter McPherson crossed the Big Black at Hankinson's ferry Vicksburg\r\ncould have been approached and besieged by the south side.  It is not\r\nprobable, however, that Pemberton would have permitted a close\r\nbesiegement.  The broken nature of the ground would have enabled him to\r\nhold a strong defensible line from the river south of the city to the\r\nBig Black, retaining possession of the railroad back to that point.  It\r\nwas my plan, therefore, to get to the railroad east of Vicksburg, and\r\napproach from that direction.  Accordingly, McPherson's troops that had\r\ncrossed the Big Black were withdrawn and the movement east to Jackson\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated before, the country is very much broken and the roads\r\ngenerally confined to the tops of the hills.  The troops were moved one\r\n(sometimes two) corps at a time to reach designated points out parallel\r\nto the railroad and only from six to ten miles from it.  McClernand's\r\ncorps was kept with its left flank on the Big Black guarding all the\r\ncrossings.  Fourteen Mile Creek, a stream substantially parallel with\r\nthe railroad, was reached and crossings effected by McClernand and\r\nSherman with slight loss.  McPherson was to the right of Sherman,\r\nextending to Raymond.  The cavalry was used in this advance in\r\nreconnoitring to find the roads:  to cover our advances and to find the\r\nmost practicable routes from one command to another so they could\r\nsupport each other in case of an attack.  In making this move I\r\nestimated Pemberton's movable force at Vicksburg at about eighteen\r\nthousand men, with smaller forces at Haines' Bluff and Jackson.  It\r\nwould not be possible for Pemberton to attack me with all his troops at\r\none place, and I determined to throw my army between his and fight him\r\nin detail.  This was done with success, but I found afterwards that I\r\nhad entirely under-estimated Pemberton's strength.\r\n\r\nUp to this point our movements had been made without serious opposition.\r\nMy line was now nearly parallel with the Jackson and Vicksburg railroad\r\nand about seven miles south of it.  The right was at Raymond eighteen\r\nmiles from Jackson, McPherson commanding; Sherman in the centre on\r\nFourteen Mile Creek, his advance thrown across; McClernand to the left,\r\nalso on Fourteen Mile Creek, advance across, and his pickets within two\r\nmiles of Edward's station, where the enemy had concentrated a\r\nconsiderable force and where they undoubtedly expected us to attack.\r\nMcClernand's left was on the Big Black.  In all our moves, up to this\r\ntime, the left had hugged the Big Black closely, and all the ferries had\r\nbeen guarded to prevent the enemy throwing a force on our rear.\r\n\r\nMcPherson encountered the enemy, five thousand strong with two batteries\r\nunder General Gregg, about two miles out of Raymond. This was about two\r\nP.M.  Logan was in advance with one of his brigades.  He deployed and\r\nmoved up to engage the enemy. McPherson ordered the road in rear to be\r\ncleared of wagons, and the balance of Logan's division, and Crocker's,\r\nwhich was still farther in rear, to come forward with all dispatch.  The\r\norder was obeyed with alacrity.  Logan got his division in position for\r\nassault before Crocker could get up, and attacked with vigor, carrying\r\nthe enemy's position easily, sending Gregg flying from the field not to\r\nappear against our front again until we met at Jackson.\r\n\r\nIn this battle McPherson lost 66 killed, 339 wounded, and 37 missing\r\n--nearly or quite all from Logan's division.  The enemy's loss was 100\r\nkilled, 305 wounded, besides 415 taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nI regarded Logan and Crocker as being as competent division commanders\r\nas could be found in or out of the army and both equal to a much higher\r\ncommand.  Crocker, however, was dying of consumption when he\r\nvolunteered.  His weak condition never put him on the sick report when\r\nthere was a battle in prospect, as long as he could keep on his feet.\r\nHe died not long after the close of the rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT AGAINST JACKSON--FALL OF JACKSON--INTERCEPTING THE ENEMY\r\n--BATTLE OF CHAMPION'S HILL.\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached me of McPherson's victory at Raymond about sundown\r\nmy position was with Sherman.  I decided at once to turn the whole\r\ncolumn towards Jackson and capture that place without delay.\r\n\r\nPemberton was now on my left, with, as I supposed, about 18,000 men; in\r\nfact, as I learned afterwards, with nearly 50,000.  A force was also\r\ncollecting on my right, at Jackson, the point where all the railroads\r\ncommunicating with Vicksburg connect. All the enemy's supplies of men\r\nand stores would come by that point.  As I hoped in the end to besiege\r\nVicksburg I must first destroy all possibility of aid.  I therefore\r\ndetermined to move swiftly towards Jackson, destroy or drive any force\r\nin that direction and then turn upon Pemberton.  But by moving against\r\nJackson, I uncovered my own communication.  So I finally decided to have\r\nnone--to cut loose altogether from my base and move my whole force\r\neastward.  I then had no fears for my communications, and if I moved\r\nquickly enough could turn upon Pemberton before he could attack me in\r\nthe rear.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, all previous orders given during the day for movements on\r\nthe 13th were annulled by new ones.  McPherson was ordered at daylight\r\nto move on Clinton, ten miles from Jackson; Sherman was notified of my\r\ndetermination to capture Jackson and work from there westward.  He was\r\nordered to start at four in the morning and march to Raymond.\r\nMcClernand was ordered to march with three divisions by Dillon's to\r\nRaymond.  One was left to guard the crossing of the Big Black.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th I had received a letter from Banks, on the Red River, asking\r\nreinforcements.  Porter had gone to his assistance with a part of his\r\nfleet on the 3d, and I now wrote to him describing my position and\r\ndeclining to send any troops.  I looked upon side movements as long as\r\nthe enemy held Port Hudson and Vicksburg as a waste of time and\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nGeneral Joseph E. Johnston arrived at Jackson in the night of the 13th\r\nfrom Tennessee, and immediately assumed command of all the Confederate\r\ntroops in Mississippi.  I knew he was expecting reinforcements from the\r\nsouth and east. On the 6th I had written to General Halleck:\r\n\"Information from the other side leaves me to believe the enemy are\r\nbringing forces from Tullahoma.\"\r\n\r\nUp to this time my troops had been kept in supporting distances of each\r\nother, as far as the nature of the country would admit.  Reconnoissances\r\nwere constantly made from each corps to enable them to acquaint\r\nthemselves with the most practicable routes from one to another in case\r\na union became necessary.\r\n\r\nMcPherson reached Clinton with the advance early on the 13th and\r\nimmediately set to work destroying the railroad.  Sherman's advance\r\nreached Raymond before the last of McPherson's command had got out of\r\nthe town.  McClernand withdrew from the front of the enemy, at Edward's\r\nstation, with much skill and without loss, and reached his position for\r\nthe night in good order.  On the night of the 13th, McPherson was\r\nordered to march at early dawn upon Jackson, only fifteen miles away.\r\nSherman was given the same order; but he was to move by the direct road\r\nfrom Raymond to Jackson, which is south of the road McPherson was on and\r\ndoes not approach within two miles of it at the point where it crossed\r\nthe line of intrenchments which, at that time, defended the city.\r\nMcClernand was ordered to move one division of his command to Clinton,\r\none division a few miles beyond Mississippi Springs following Sherman's\r\nline, and a third to Raymond.  He was also directed to send his siege\r\nguns, four in number with the troops going by Mississippi Springs.\r\nMcClernand's position was an advantageous one in any event. With one\r\ndivision at Clinton he was in position to reinforce McPherson, at\r\nJackson, rapidly if it became necessary; the division beyond Mississippi\r\nSprings was equally available to reinforce Sherman; the one at Raymond\r\ncould take either road. He still had two other divisions farther back\r\nnow that Blair had come up, available within a day at Jackson.  If this\r\nlast command should not be wanted at Jackson, they were already one\r\nday's march from there on their way to Vicksburg and on three different\r\nroads leading to the latter city.  But the most important consideration\r\nin my mind was to have a force confronting Pemberton if he should come\r\nout to attack my rear. This I expected him to do; as shown further on,\r\nhe was directed by Johnston to make this very move.\r\n\r\nI notified General Halleck that I should attack the State capital on the\r\n14th.  A courier carried the dispatch to Grand Gulf through an\r\nunprotected country.\r\n\r\nSherman and McPherson communicated with each other during the night and\r\narranged to reach Jackson at about the same hour.  It rained in torrents\r\nduring the night of the 13th and the fore part of the day of the 14th.\r\nThe roads were intolerable, and in some places on Sherman's line, where\r\nthe land was low, they were covered more than a foot deep with water.\r\nBut the troops never murmured.  By nine o'clock Crocker, of McPherson's\r\ncorps, who was now in advance, came upon the enemy's pickets and\r\nspeedily drove them in upon the main body.  They were outside of the\r\nintrenchments in a strong position, and proved to be the troops that had\r\nbeen driven out of Raymond.  Johnston had been reinforced; during the\r\nnight by Georgia and South Carolina regiments, so that his force\r\namounted to eleven thousand men, and he was expecting still more.\r\n\r\nSherman also came upon the rebel pickets some distance out from the\r\ntown, but speedily drove them in.  He was now on the south and\r\nsouth-west of Jackson confronting the Confederates behind their\r\nbreastworks, while McPherson's right was nearly two miles north,\r\noccupying a line running north and south across the Vicksburg railroad.\r\nArtillery was brought up and reconnoissances made preparatory to an\r\nassault. McPherson brought up Logan's division while he deployed\r\nCrocker's for the assault.  Sherman made similar dispositions on the\r\nright.  By eleven A.M. both were ready to attack.  Crocker moved his\r\ndivision forward, preceded by a strong skirmish line.  These troops at\r\nonce encountered the enemy's advance and drove it back on the main body,\r\nwhen they returned to their proper regiment and the whole division\r\ncharged, routing the enemy completely and driving him into this main\r\nline.  This stand by the enemy was made more than two miles outside of\r\nhis main fortifications. McPherson followed up with his command until\r\nwithin range of the guns of the enemy from their intrenchments, when he\r\nhalted to bring his troops into line and reconnoitre to determine the\r\nnext move.  It was now about noon.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on Sherman was confronting a rebel battery which\r\nenfiladed the road on which he was marching--the Mississippi Springs\r\nroad--and commanded a bridge spanning a stream over which he had to\r\npass.  By detaching right and left the stream was forced and the enemy\r\nflanked and speedily driven within the main line.  This brought our\r\nwhole line in front of the enemy's line of works, which was continuous\r\non the north, west and south sides from the Pearl River north of the\r\ncity to the same river south.  I was with Sherman.  He was confronted by\r\na force sufficient to hold us back.  Appearances did not justify an\r\nassault where we were.  I had directed Sherman to send a force to the\r\nright, and to reconnoitre as far as to the Pearl River.  This force,\r\nTuttle's division, not returning I rode to the right with my staff, and\r\nsoon found that the enemy had left that part of the line.  Tuttle's\r\nmovement or McPherson's pressure had no doubt led Johnston to order a\r\nretreat, leaving only the men at the guns to retard us while he was\r\ngetting away.  Tuttle had seen this and, passing through the lines\r\nwithout resistance, came up in the rear of the artillerists confronting\r\nSherman and captured them with ten pieces of artillery.  I rode\r\nimmediately to the State House, where I was soon followed by Sherman.\r\nAbout the same time McPherson discovered that the enemy was leaving his\r\nfront, and advanced Crocker, who was so close upon the enemy that they\r\ncould not move their guns or destroy them.  He captured seven guns and,\r\nmoving on, hoisted the National flag over the rebel capital of\r\nMississippi.  Stevenson's brigade was sent to cut off the rebel retreat,\r\nbut was too late or not expeditious enough.\r\n\r\nOur loss in this engagement was:  McPherson, 37 killed, 228 wounded;\r\nSherman, 4 killed and 21 wounded and missing.  The enemy lost 845\r\nkilled, wounded and captured.  Seventeen guns fell into our hands, and\r\nthe enemy destroyed by fire their store-houses, containing a large\r\namount of commissary stores.\r\n\r\nOn this day Blair reached New Auburn and joined McClernand's 4th\r\ndivision.  He had with him two hundred wagons loaded with rations, the\r\nonly commissary supplies received during the entire campaign.\r\n\r\nI slept that night in the room that Johnston was said to have occupied\r\nthe night before.\r\n\r\nAbout four in the afternoon I sent for the corps commanders and directed\r\nthe dispositions to be made of their troops.  Sherman was to remain in\r\nJackson until he destroyed that place as a railroad centre, and\r\nmanufacturing city of military supplies. He did the work most\r\neffectually.  Sherman and I went together into a manufactory which had\r\nnot ceased work on account of the battle nor for the entrance of Yankee\r\ntroops.  Our presence did not seem to attract the attention of either\r\nthe manager or the operatives, most of whom were girls.  We looked on\r\nfor a while to see the tent cloth which they were making roll out of the\r\nlooms, with \"C. S. A.\"  woven in each bolt.  There was an immense amount\r\nof cotton, in bales, stacked outside.  Finally I told Sherman I thought\r\nthey had done work enough.  The operatives were told they could leave\r\nand take with them what cloth they could carry.  In a few minutes cotton\r\nand factory were in a blaze. The proprietor visited Washington while I\r\nwas President to get his pay for this property, claiming that it was\r\nprivate.  He asked me to give him a statement of the fact that his\r\nproperty had been destroyed by National troops, so that he might use it\r\nwith Congress where he was pressing, or proposed to press, his claim.  I\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 13th Johnston sent the following dispatch to\r\nPemberton at Edward's station:  \"I have lately arrived, and learn that\r\nMajor-General Sherman is between us with four divisions at Clinton.  It\r\nis important to establish communication, that you may be reinforced.  If\r\npracticable, come up in his rear at once.  To beat such a detachment\r\nwould be of immense value.  All the troops you can quickly assemble\r\nshould be brought.  Time is all-important.\"  This dispatch was sent in\r\ntriplicate, by different messengers.  One of the messengers happened to\r\nbe a loyal man who had been expelled from Memphis some months before by\r\nHurlbut for uttering disloyal and threatening sentiments. There was a\r\ngood deal of parade about his expulsion, ostensibly as a warning to\r\nthose who entertained the sentiments he expressed; but Hurlbut and the\r\nexpelled man understood each other.  He delivered his copy of Johnston's\r\ndispatch to McPherson who forwarded it to me.\r\n\r\nReceiving this dispatch on the 14th I ordered McPherson to move promptly\r\nin the morning back to Bolton, the nearest point where Johnston could\r\nreach the road.  Bolton is about twenty miles west of Jackson.  I also\r\ninformed McClernand of the capture of Jackson and sent him the following\r\norder:  \"It is evidently the design of the enemy to get north of us and\r\ncross the Big Black, and beat us into Vicksburg.  We must not allow them\r\nto do this.  Turn all your forces towards Bolton station, and make all\r\ndispatch in getting there.  Move troops by the most direct road from\r\nwherever they may be on the receipt of this order.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to Blair I wrote:  \"Their design is evidently to cross the Big Black\r\nand pass down the peninsula between the Big Black and Yazoo rivers.  We\r\nmust beat them.  Turn your troops immediately to Bolton; take all the\r\ntrains with you.  Smith's division, and any other troops now with you,\r\nwill go to the same place.  If practicable, take parallel roads, so as\r\nto divide your troops and train.\"\r\n\r\nJohnston stopped on the Canton road only six miles north of Jackson, the\r\nnight of the 14th.  He sent from there to Pemberton dispatches\r\nannouncing the loss of Jackson, and the following order:\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the reinforcements are all up, they must be united to the\r\nrest of the army.  I am anxious to see a force assembled that may be\r\nable to inflict a heavy blow upon the enemy.  Can Grant supply himself\r\nfrom the Mississippi?  Can you not cut him off from it, and above all,\r\nshould he be compelled to fall back for want of supplies, beat him.\"\r\n\r\nThe concentration of my troops was easy, considering the character of\r\nthe country.  McPherson moved along the road parallel with and near the\r\nrailroad.  McClernand's command was, one division (Hovey's) on the road\r\nMcPherson had to take, but with a start of four miles.  One (Osterhaus)\r\nwas at Raymond, on a converging road that intersected the other near\r\nChampion's Hill; one (Carr's) had to pass over the same road with\r\nOsterhaus, but being back at Mississippi Springs, would not be detained\r\nby it; the fourth (Smith's) with Blair's division, was near Auburn with\r\na different road to pass over.  McClernand faced about and moved\r\npromptly.  His cavalry from Raymond seized Bolton by half-past nine in\r\nthe morning, driving out the enemy's pickets and capturing several men.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 15th Hovey was at Bolton; Carr and Osterhaus were about\r\nthree miles south, but abreast, facing west; Smith was north of Raymond\r\nwith Blair in his rear.\r\n\r\nMcPherson's command, with Logan in front, had marched at seven o'clock,\r\nand by four reached Hovey and went into camp; Crocker bivouacked just in\r\nHovey's rear on the Clinton road.  Sherman with two divisions, was in\r\nJackson, completing the destruction of roads, bridges and military\r\nfactories.  I rode in person out to Clinton.  On my arrival I ordered\r\nMcClernand to move early in the morning on Edward's station, cautioning\r\nhim to watch for the enemy and not bring on an engagement unless he felt\r\nvery certain of success.\r\n\r\nI naturally expected that Pemberton would endeavor to obey the orders of\r\nhis superior, which I have shown were to attack us at Clinton.  This,\r\nindeed, I knew he could not do; but I felt sure he would make the\r\nattempt to reach that point.  It turned out, however, that he had\r\ndecided his superior's plans were impracticable, and consequently\r\ndetermined to move south from Edward's station and get between me and my\r\nbase.  I, however, had no base, having abandoned it more than a week\r\nbefore.  On the 15th Pemberton had actually marched south from Edward's\r\nstation, but the rains had swollen Baker's Creek, which he had to cross\r\nso much that he could not ford it, and the bridges were washed away.\r\nThis brought him back to the Jackson road, on which there was a good\r\nbridge over Baker's Creek.  Some of his troops were marching until\r\nmidnight to get there.  Receiving here early on the 16th a repetition of\r\nhis order to join Johnston at Clinton, he concluded to obey, and sent a\r\ndispatch to his chief, informing him of the route by which he might be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nAbout five o'clock in the morning (16th) two men, who had been employed\r\non the Jackson and Vicksburg railroad, were brought to me.  They\r\nreported that they had passed through Pemberton's army in the night, and\r\nthat it was still marching east. They reported him to have eighty\r\nregiments of infantry and ten batteries; in all, about twenty-five\r\nthousand men.\r\n\r\nI had expected to leave Sherman at Jackson another day in order to\r\ncomplete his work; but getting the above information I sent him orders\r\nto move with all dispatch to Bolton, and to put one division with an\r\nammunition train on the road at once, with directions to its commander\r\nto march with all possible speed until he came up to our rear.  Within\r\nan hour after receiving this order Steele's division was on the road.\r\nAt the same time I dispatched to Blair, who was near Auburn, to move\r\nwith all speed to Edward's station.  McClernand was directed to embrace\r\nBlair in his command for the present.  Blair's division was a part of\r\nthe 15th army corps (Sherman's); but as it was on its way to join its\r\ncorps, it naturally struck our left first, now that we had faced about\r\nand were moving west. The 15th corps, when it got up, would be on our\r\nextreme right.  McPherson was directed to get his trains out of the way\r\nof the troops, and to follow Hovey's division as closely as possible.\r\nMcClernand had two roads about three miles apart, converging at Edward's\r\nstation, over which to march his troops.  Hovey's division of his corps\r\nhad the advance on a third road (the Clinton) still farther north.\r\nMcClernand was directed to move Blair's and A. J. Smith's divisions by\r\nthe southernmost of these roads, and Osterhaus and Carr by the middle\r\nroad.  Orders were to move cautiously with skirmishers to the front to\r\nfeel for the enemy.\r\n\r\nSmith's division on the most southern road was the first to encounter\r\nthe enemy's pickets, who were speedily driven in. Osterhaus, on the\r\nmiddle road, hearing the firing, pushed his skirmishers forward, found\r\nthe enemy's pickets and forced them back to the main line.  About the\r\nsame time Hovey encountered the enemy on the northern or direct wagon\r\nroad from Jackson to Vicksburg.  McPherson was hastening up to join\r\nHovey, but was embarrassed by Hovey's trains occupying the roads.  I was\r\nstill back at Clinton.  McPherson sent me word of the situation, and\r\nexpressed the wish that I was up.  By half-past seven I was on the road\r\nand proceeded rapidly to the front, ordering all trains that were in\r\nfront of troops off the road.  When I arrived Hovey's skirmishing\r\namounted almost to a battle.\r\n\r\nMcClernand was in person on the middle road and had a shorter distance\r\nto march to reach the enemy's position than McPherson.  I sent him word\r\nby a staff officer to push forward and attack.  These orders were\r\nrepeated several times without apparently expediting McClernand's\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nChampion's Hill, where Pemberton had chosen his position to receive us,\r\nwhether taken by accident or design, was well selected.  It is one of\r\nthe highest points in that section, and commanded all the ground in\r\nrange.  On the east side of the ridge, which is quite precipitous, is a\r\nravine running first north, then westerly, terminating at Baker's Creek.\r\nIt was grown up thickly with large trees and undergrowth, making it\r\ndifficult to penetrate with troops, even when not defended.  The ridge\r\noccupied by the enemy terminated abruptly where the ravine turns\r\nwesterly.  The left of the enemy occupied the north end of this ridge.\r\nThe Bolton and Edward's station wagon-road turns almost due south at\r\nthis point and ascends the ridge, which it follows for about a mile;\r\nthen turning west, descends by a gentle declivity to Baker's Creek,\r\nnearly a mile away.  On the west side the slope of the ridge is gradual\r\nand is cultivated from near the summit to the creek.  There was, when we\r\nwere there, a narrow belt of timber near the summit west of the road.\r\n\r\nFrom Raymond there is a direct road to Edward's station, some three\r\nmiles west of Champion's Hill.  There is one also to Bolton.  From this\r\nlatter road there is still another, leaving it about three and a half\r\nmiles before reaching Bolton and leads direct to the same station.  It\r\nwas along these two roads that three divisions of McClernand's corps,\r\nand Blair of Sherman's, temporarily under McClernand, were moving.\r\nHovey of McClernand's command was with McPherson, farther north on the\r\nroad from Bolton direct to Edward's station.  The middle road comes into\r\nthe northern road at the point where the latter turns to the west and\r\ndescends to Baker's Creek; the southern road is still several miles\r\nsouth and does not intersect the others until it reaches Edward's\r\nstation.  Pemberton's lines covered all these roads, and faced east.\r\nHovey's line, when it first drove in the enemy's pickets, was formed\r\nparallel to that of the enemy and confronted his left.\r\n\r\nBy eleven o'clock the skirmishing had grown into a hard-contested\r\nbattle.  Hovey alone, before other troops could be got to assist him,\r\nhad captured a battery of the enemy.  But he was not able to hold his\r\nposition and had to abandon the artillery.  McPherson brought up his\r\ntroops as fast as possible, Logan in front, and posted them on the right\r\nof Hovey and across the flank of the enemy.  Logan reinforced Hovey with\r\none brigade from his division; with his other two he moved farther west\r\nto make room for Crocker, who was coming up as rapidly as the roads\r\nwould admit.  Hovey was still being heavily pressed, and was calling on\r\nme for more reinforcements.  I ordered Crocker, who was now coming up,\r\nto send one brigade from his division. McPherson ordered two batteries\r\nto be stationed where they nearly enfiladed the enemy's line, and they\r\ndid good execution.\r\n\r\nFrom Logan's position now a direct forward movement carried him over\r\nopen fields, in rear of the enemy and in a line parallel with them.  He\r\ndid make exactly this move, attacking, however, the enemy through the\r\nbelt of woods covering the west slope of the hill for a short distance.\r\nUp to this time I had kept my position near Hovey where we were the most\r\nheavily pressed; but about noon I moved with a part of my staff by our\r\nright around, until I came up with Logan himself.  I found him near the\r\nroad leading down to Baker's Creek.  He was actually in command of the\r\nonly road over which the enemy could retreat; Hovey, reinforced by two\r\nbrigades from McPherson's command, confronted the enemy's left; Crocker,\r\nwith two brigades, covered their left flank; McClernand two hours\r\nbefore, had been within two miles and a half of their centre with two\r\ndivisions, and the two divisions, Blair's and A. J. Smith's, were\r\nconfronting the rebel right; Ransom, with a brigade of McArthur's\r\ndivision of the 17th corps (McPherson's), had crossed the river at Grand\r\nGulf a few days before, and was coming up on their right flank.  Neither\r\nLogan nor I knew that we had cut off the retreat of the enemy.  Just at\r\nthis juncture a messenger came from Hovey, asking for more\r\nreinforcements.  There were none to spare.  I then gave an order to move\r\nMcPherson's command by the left flank around to Hovey. This uncovered\r\nthe rebel line of retreat, which was soon taken advantage of by the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, Hovey, reinforced as he was by a brigade from\r\nLogan and another from Crocker, and by Crocker gallantly coming up with\r\ntwo other brigades on his right, had made several assaults, the last one\r\nabout the time the road was opened to the rear.  The enemy fled\r\nprecipitately.  This was between three and four o'clock.  I rode\r\nforward, or rather back, to where the middle road intersects the north\r\nroad, and found the skirmishers of Carr's division just coming in.\r\nOsterhaus was farther south and soon after came up with skirmishers\r\nadvanced in like manner.  Hovey's division, and McPherson's two\r\ndivisions with him, had marched and fought from early dawn, and were not\r\nin the best condition to follow the retreating foe.  I sent orders to\r\nOsterhaus to pursue the enemy, and to Carr, whom I saw personally, I\r\nexplained the situation and directed him to pursue vigorously as far as\r\nthe Big Black, and to cross it if he could; Osterhaus to follow him.\r\nThe pursuit was continued until after dark.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Champion's Hill lasted about four hours, hard fighting,\r\npreceded by two or three hours of skirmishing, some of which almost rose\r\nto the dignity of battle.  Every man of Hovey's division and of\r\nMcPherson's two divisions was engaged during the battle.  No other part\r\nof my command was engaged at all, except that as described before.\r\nOsterhaus's and A. J. Smith's divisions had encountered the rebel\r\nadvanced pickets as early as half-past seven.  Their positions were\r\nadmirable for advancing upon the enemy's line.  McClernand, with two\r\ndivisions, was within a few miles of the battle-field long before noon\r\nand in easy hearing.  I sent him repeated orders by staff officers fully\r\ncompetent to explain to him the situation.  These traversed the wood\r\nseparating us, without escort, and directed him to push forward; but he\r\ndid not come.  It is true, in front of McClernand there was a small\r\nforce of the enemy and posted in a good position behind a ravine\r\nobstructing his advance; but if he had moved to the right by the road my\r\nstaff officers had followed the enemy must either have fallen back or\r\nbeen cut off.  Instead of this he sent orders to Hovey, who belonged to\r\nhis corps, to join on to his right flank.  Hovey was bearing the brunt\r\nof the battle at the time.  To obey the order he would have had to pull\r\nout from the front of the enemy and march back as far as McClernand had\r\nto advance to get into battle and substantially over the same ground.\r\nOf course I did not permit Hovey to obey the order of his intermediate\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\nWe had in this battle about 15,000 men absolutely engaged.  This\r\nexcludes those that did not get up, all of McClernand's command except\r\nHovey.  Our loss was 410 killed, 1,844 wounded and 187 missing.  Hovey\r\nalone lost 1,200 killed, wounded and missing--more than one-third of his\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nHad McClernand come up with reasonable promptness, or had I known the\r\nground as I did afterwards, I cannot see how Pemberton could have\r\nescaped with any organized force.  As it was he lost over three thousand\r\nkilled and wounded and about three thousand captured in battle and in\r\npursuit.  Loring's division, which was the right of Pemberton's line,\r\nwas cut off from the retreating army and never got back into Vicksburg.\r\nPemberton himself fell back that night to the Big Black River.  His\r\ntroops did not stop before midnight and many of them left before the\r\ngeneral retreat commenced, and no doubt a good part of them returned to\r\ntheir homes.  Logan alone captured 1,300 prisoners and eleven guns.\r\nHovey captured 300 under fire and about 700 in all, exclusive of 500\r\nsick and wounded whom he paroled, thus making 1,200.\r\n\r\nMcPherson joined in the advance as soon as his men could fill their\r\ncartridge-boxes, leaving one brigade to guard our wounded.  The pursuit\r\nwas continued as long as it was light enough to see the road.  The night\r\nof the 16th of May found McPherson's command bivouacked from two to six\r\nmiles west of the battlefield, along the line of the road to Vicksburg.\r\nCarr and Osterhaus were at Edward's station, and Blair was about three\r\nmiles south-east; Hovey remained on the field where his troops had\r\nfought so bravely and bled so freely.  Much war material abandoned by\r\nthe enemy was picked up on the battle-field, among it thirty pieces of\r\nartillery.  I pushed through the advancing column with my staff and kept\r\nin advance until after night. Finding ourselves alone we stopped and\r\ntook possession of a vacant house.  As no troops came up we moved back a\r\nmile or more until we met the head of the column just going into bivouac\r\non the road.  We had no tents, so we occupied the porch of a house which\r\nhad been taken for a rebel hospital and which was filled with wounded\r\nand dying who had been brought from the battle-field we had just left.\r\n\r\nWhile a battle is raging one can see his enemy mowed down by the\r\nthousand, or the ten thousand, with great composure; but after the\r\nbattle these scenes are distressing, and one is naturally disposed to do\r\nas much to alleviate the suffering of an enemy as a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF BLACK RIVER BRIDGE--CROSSING THE BIG BLACK--INVESTMENT OF\r\nVICKSBURG--ASSAULTING THE WORKS.\r\n\r\nWe were now assured of our position between Johnston and Pemberton,\r\nwithout a possibility of a junction of their forces.  Pemberton might\r\nhave made a night march to the Big Black, crossed the bridge there and,\r\nby moving north on the west side, have eluded us and finally returned to\r\nJohnston.  But this would have given us Vicksburg.  It would have been\r\nhis proper move, however, and the one Johnston would have made had he\r\nbeen in Pemberton's place.  In fact it would have been in conformity\r\nwith Johnston's orders to Pemberton.\r\n\r\nSherman left Jackson with the last of his troops about noon on the 16th\r\nand reached Bolton, twenty miles west, before halting.  His rear guard\r\ndid not get in until two A.M. the 17th, but renewed their march by\r\ndaylight.  He paroled his prisoners at Jackson, and was forced to leave\r\nhis own wounded in care of surgeons and attendants.  At Bolton he was\r\ninformed of our victory.  He was directed to commence the march early\r\nnext day, and to diverge from the road he was on to Bridgeport on the\r\nBig Black River, some eleven miles above the point where we expected to\r\nfind the enemy.  Blair was ordered to join him there with the pontoon\r\ntrain as early as possible.\r\n\r\nThis movement brought Sherman's corps together, and at a point where I\r\nhoped a crossing of the Big Black might be effected and Sherman's corps\r\nused to flank the enemy out of his position in our front, thus opening a\r\ncrossing for the remainder of the army.  I informed him that I would\r\nendeavor to hold the enemy in my front while he crossed the river.\r\n\r\nThe advance division, Carr's (McClernand's corps), resumed the pursuit\r\nat half-past three A.M. on the 17th, followed closely by Osterhaus,\r\nMcPherson bringing up the rear with his corps.  As I expected, the enemy\r\nwas found in position on the Big Black.  The point was only six miles\r\nfrom that where my advance had rested for the night, and was reached at\r\nan early hour.  Here the river makes a turn to the west, and has washed\r\nclose up to the high land; the east side is a low bottom, sometimes\r\noverflowed at very high water, but was cleared and in cultivation.  A\r\nbayou runs irregularly across this low land, the bottom of which,\r\nhowever, is above the surface of the Big Black at ordinary stages.  When\r\nthe river is full water runs through it, converting the point of land\r\ninto an island.  The bayou was grown up with timber, which the enemy had\r\nfelled into the ditch.  At this time there was a foot or two of water in\r\nit. The rebels had constructed a parapet along the inner bank of this\r\nbayou by using cotton bales from the plantation close by and throwing\r\ndirt over them.  The whole was thoroughly commanded from the height west\r\nof the river.  At the upper end of the bayou there was a strip of\r\nuncleared land which afforded a cover for a portion of our men.  Carr's\r\ndivision was deployed on our right, Lawler's brigade forming his extreme\r\nright and reaching through these woods to the river above.  Osterhaus'\r\ndivision was deployed to the left of Carr and covered the enemy's entire\r\nfront.  McPherson was in column on the road, the head close by, ready to\r\ncome in wherever he could be of assistance.\r\n\r\nWhile the troops were standing as here described an officer from Banks'\r\nstaff came up and presented me with a letter from General Halleck, dated\r\nthe 11th of May.  It had been sent by the way of New Orleans to Banks to\r\nbe forwarded to me.  It ordered me to return to Grand Gulf and to\r\nco-operate from there with Banks against Port Hudson, and then to return\r\nwith our combined forces to besiege Vicksburg.  I told the officer that\r\nthe order came too late, and that Halleck would not give it now if he\r\nknew our position.  The bearer of the dispatch insisted that I ought to\r\nobey the order, and was giving arguments to support his position when I\r\nheard great cheering to the right of our line and, looking in that\r\ndirection, saw Lawler in his shirt sleeves leading a charge upon the\r\nenemy.  I immediately mounted my horse and rode in the direction of the\r\ncharge, and saw no more of the officer who delivered the dispatch; I\r\nthink not even to this day.\r\n\r\nThe assault was successful.  But little resistance was made. The enemy\r\nfled from the west bank of the river, burning the bridge behind him and\r\nleaving the men and guns on the east side to fall into our hands.  Many\r\ntried to escape by swimming the river. Some succeeded and some were\r\ndrowned in the attempt. Eighteen guns were captured and 1,751 prisoners.\r\nOur loss was 39 killed, 237 wounded and 3 missing.  The enemy probably\r\nlost but few men except those captured and drowned.  But for the\r\nsuccessful and complete destruction of the bridge, I have but little\r\ndoubt that we should have followed the enemy so closely as to prevent\r\nhis occupying his defences around Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nAs the bridge was destroyed and the river was high, new bridges had to\r\nbe built.  It was but little after nine o'clock A.M. when the capture\r\ntook place.  As soon as work could be commenced, orders were given for\r\nthe construction of three bridges.  One was taken charge of by\r\nLieutenant Hains, of the Engineer Corps, one by General McPherson\r\nhimself and one by General Ransom, a most gallant and intelligent\r\nvolunteer officer.  My recollection is that Hains built a raft bridge;\r\nMcPherson a pontoon, using cotton bales in large numbers, for pontoons;\r\nand that Ransom felled trees on opposite banks of the river, cutting\r\nonly on one side of the tree, so that they would fall with their tops\r\ninterlacing in the river, without the trees being entirely severed from\r\ntheir stumps.  A bridge was then made with these trees to support the\r\nroadway.  Lumber was taken from buildings, cotton gins and wherever\r\nfound, for this purpose.  By eight o'clock in the morning of the 18th\r\nall three bridges were complete and the troops were crossing.\r\n\r\nSherman reached Bridgeport about noon of the 17th and found Blair with\r\nthe pontoon train already there.  A few of the enemy were intrenched on\r\nthe west bank, but they made little resistance and soon surrendered.\r\nTwo divisions were crossed that night and the third the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th I moved along the Vicksburg road in advance of the troops\r\nand as soon as possible joined Sherman.  My first anxiety was to secure\r\na base of supplies on the Yazoo River above Vicksburg.  Sherman's line\r\nof march led him to the very point on Walnut Hills occupied by the enemy\r\nthe December before when he was repulsed.  Sherman was equally anxious\r\nwith myself.  Our impatience led us to move in advance of the column and\r\nwell up with the advanced skirmishers.  There were some detached works\r\nalong the crest of the hill.  These were still occupied by the enemy, or\r\nelse the garrison from Haines' Bluff had not all got past on their way\r\nto Vicksburg.  At all events the bullets of the enemy whistled by thick\r\nand fast for a short time.  In a few minutes Sherman had the pleasure of\r\nlooking down from the spot coveted so much by him the December before on\r\nthe ground where his command had lain so helpless for offensive action.\r\nHe turned to me, saying that up to this minute he had felt no positive\r\nassurance of success.  This, however, he said was the end of one of the\r\ngreatest campaigns in history and I ought to make a report of it at\r\nonce.  Vicksburg was not yet captured, and there was no telling what\r\nmight happen before it was taken; but whether captured or not, this was\r\na complete and successful campaign.  I do not claim to quote Sherman's\r\nlanguage; but the substance only.  My reason for mentioning this\r\nincident will appear further on.\r\n\r\nMcPherson, after crossing the Big Black, came into the Jackson and\r\nVicksburg road which Sherman was on, but to his rear.  He arrived at\r\nnight near the lines of the enemy, and went into camp.  McClernand moved\r\nby the direct road near the railroad to Mount Albans, and then turned to\r\nthe left and put his troops on the road from Baldwin's ferry to\r\nVicksburg.  This brought him south of McPherson.  I now had my three\r\ncorps up the works built for the defence of Vicksburg, on three roads\r\n--one to the north, one to the east and one to the south-east of the city.\r\nBy the morning of the 19th the investment was as complete as my limited\r\nnumber of troops would allow.  Sherman was on the right, and covered the\r\nhigh ground from where it overlooked the Yazoo as far south-east as his\r\ntroops would extend.  McPherson joined on to his left, and occupied\r\nground on both sides of the Jackson road.  McClernand took up the ground\r\nto his left and extended as far towards Warrenton as he could, keeping a\r\ncontinuous line.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th there was constant skirmishing with the enemy while we were\r\ngetting into better position.  The enemy had been much demoralized by\r\nhis defeats at Champion's Hill and the Big Black, and I believed he\r\nwould not make much effort to hold Vicksburg. Accordingly, at two\r\no'clock I ordered an assault.  It resulted in securing more advanced\r\npositions for all our troops where they were fully covered from the fire\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe 20th and 21st were spent in strengthening our position and in making\r\nroads in rear of the army, from Yazoo River or Chickasaw Bayou.  Most of\r\nthe army had now been for three weeks with only five days' rations\r\nissued by the commissary.  They had an abundance of food, however, but\r\nbegan to feel the want of bread.  I remember that in passing around to\r\nthe left of the line on the 21st, a soldier, recognizing me, said in\r\nrather a low voice, but yet so that I heard him, \"Hard tack.\"  In a\r\nmoment the cry was taken up all along the line, \"Hard tack! Hard tack!\"\r\nI told the men nearest to me that we had been engaged ever since the\r\narrival of the troops in building a road over which to supply them with\r\neverything they needed.  The cry was instantly changed to cheers.  By\r\nthe night of the 21st all the troops had full rations issued to them.\r\nThe bread and coffee were highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI now determined on a second assault.  Johnston was in my rear, only\r\nfifty miles away, with an army not much inferior in numbers to the one I\r\nhad with me, and I knew he was being reinforced. There was danger of his\r\ncoming to the assistance of Pemberton, and after all he might defeat my\r\nanticipations of capturing the garrison if, indeed, he did not prevent\r\nthe capture of the city.  The immediate capture of Vicksburg would save\r\nsending me the reinforcements which were so much wanted elsewhere, and\r\nwould set free the army under me to drive Johnston from the State.  But\r\nthe first consideration of all was--the troops believed they could carry\r\nthe works in their front, and would not have worked so patiently in the\r\ntrenches if they had not been allowed to try.\r\n\r\nThe attack was ordered to commence on all parts of the line at ten\r\no'clock A.M. on the 22d with a furious cannonade from every battery in\r\nposition.  All the corps commanders set their time by mine so that all\r\nmight open the engagement at the same minute. The attack was gallant,\r\nand portions of each of the three corps succeeded in getting up to the\r\nvery parapets of the enemy and in planting their battle flags upon them;\r\nbut at no place were we able to enter.  General McClernand reported that\r\nhe had gained the enemy's intrenchments at several points, and wanted\r\nreinforcements.  I occupied a position from which I believed I could see\r\nas well as he what took place in his front, and I did not see the\r\nsuccess he reported.  But his request for reinforcements being repeated\r\nI could not ignore it, and sent him Quinby's division of the 17th corps.\r\nSherman and McPherson were both ordered to renew their assaults as a\r\ndiversion in favor of McClernand.  This last attack only served to\r\nincrease our casualties without giving any benefit whatever.  As soon as\r\nit was dark our troops that had reached the enemy's line and been\r\nobliged to remain there for security all day, were withdrawn; and thus\r\nended the last assault upon Vicksburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF VICKSBURG.\r\n\r\nI now determined upon a regular siege--to \"out-camp the enemy,\" as it\r\nwere, and to incur no more losses.  The experience of the 22d convinced\r\nofficers and men that this was best, and they went to work on the\r\ndefences and approaches with a will.  With the navy holding the river,\r\nthe investment of Vicksburg was complete.  As long as we could hold our\r\nposition the enemy was limited in supplies of food, men and munitions of\r\nwar to what they had on hand.  These could not last always.\r\n\r\nThe crossing of troops at Bruinsburg commenced April 30th.  On the 18th\r\nof May the army was in rear of Vicksburg.  On the 19th, just twenty days\r\nafter the crossing, the city was completely invested and an assault had\r\nbeen made:  five distinct battles (besides continuous skirmishing) had\r\nbeen fought and won by the Union forces; the capital of the State had\r\nfallen and its arsenals, military manufactories and everything useful\r\nfor military purposes had been destroyed; an average of about one\r\nhundred and eighty miles had been marched by the troops engaged; but\r\nfive days' rations had been issued, and no forage; over six thousand\r\nprisoners had been captured, and as many more of the enemy had been\r\nkilled or wounded; twenty-seven heavy cannon and sixty-one field-pieces\r\nhad fallen into our hands; and four hundred miles of the river, from\r\nVicksburg to Port Hudson, had become ours.  The Union force that had\r\ncrossed the Mississippi River up to this time was less than forty-three\r\nthousand men. One division of these, Blair's, only arrived in time to\r\ntake part in the battle of Champion's Hill, but was not engaged there;\r\nand one brigade, Ransom's of McPherson's corps, reached the field after\r\nthe battle.  The enemy had at Vicksburg, Grand Gulf, Jackson, and on the\r\nroads between these places, over sixty thousand men.  They were in their\r\nown country, where no rear guards were necessary.  The country is\r\nadmirable for defence, but difficult for the conduct of an offensive\r\ncampaign.  All their troops had to be met.  We were fortunate, to say\r\nthe least, in meeting them in detail:  at Port Gibson seven or eight\r\nthousand; at Raymond, five thousand; at Jackson, from eight to eleven\r\nthousand; at Champion's Hill, twenty-five thousand; at the Big Black,\r\nfour thousand.  A part of those met at Jackson were all that was left of\r\nthose encountered at Raymond.  They were beaten in detail by a force\r\nsmaller than their own, upon their own ground.  Our loss up to this time\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n                             KILLED  WOUNDED  MISSING\r\n\r\n Port Gibson.....              131     719      25\r\n South Fork Bayou Pierre.....   ..       1      ..\r\n Skirmishes, May 3 .....         1       9      ..\r\n Fourteen Mile Creek.....        6      24      ..\r\n Raymond...............         66     339      39\r\n Jackson.....                   42     251       7\r\n Champion's Hill.....          410   1,844     187\r\n Big Black.....                 39     237       3\r\n Bridgeport.....                ..       1      ..\r\n Total.....                    695   3,425     259\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the wounded many were but slightly so, and continued on duty.  Not\r\nhalf of them were disabled for any length of time.\r\n\r\nAfter the unsuccessful assault of the 22d the work of the regular siege\r\nbegan.  Sherman occupied the right starting from the river above\r\nVicksburg, McPherson the centre (McArthur's division now with him) and\r\nMcClernand the left, holding the road south to Warrenton.  Lauman's\r\ndivision arrived at this time and was placed on the extreme left of the\r\nline.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between the assaults of the 19th and 22d, roads had been\r\ncompleted from the Yazoo River and Chickasaw Bayou, around the rear of\r\nthe army, to enable us to bring up supplies of food and ammunition;\r\nground had been selected and cleared on which the troops were to be\r\nencamped, and tents and cooking utensils were brought up.  The troops\r\nhad been without these from the time of crossing the Mississippi up to\r\nthis time.  All was now ready for the pick and spade.  Prentiss and\r\nHurlbut were ordered to send forward every man that could be spared.\r\nCavalry especially was wanted to watch the fords along the Big Black,\r\nand to observe Johnston.  I knew that Johnston was receiving\r\nreinforcements from Bragg, who was confronting Rosecrans in Tennessee.\r\nVicksburg was so important to the enemy that I believed he would make\r\nthe most strenuous efforts to raise the siege, even at the risk of\r\nlosing ground elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMy line was more than fifteen miles long, extending from Haines' Bluff\r\nto Vicksburg, thence to Warrenton.  The line of the enemy was about\r\nseven.  In addition to this, having an enemy at Canton and Jackson, in\r\nour rear, who was being constantly reinforced, we required a second line\r\nof defence facing the other way.  I had not troops enough under my\r\ncommand to man these.  General Halleck appreciated the situation and,\r\nwithout being asked, forwarded reinforcements with all possible\r\ndispatch.\r\n\r\nThe ground about Vicksburg is admirable for defence.  On the north it is\r\nabout two hundred feet above the Mississippi River at the highest point\r\nand very much cut up by the washing rains; the ravines were grown up\r\nwith cane and underbrush, while the sides and tops were covered with a\r\ndense forest.  Farther south the ground flattens out somewhat, and was\r\nin cultivation.  But here, too, it was cut up by ravines and small\r\nstreams.  The enemy's line of defence followed the crest of a ridge from\r\nthe river north of the city eastward, then southerly around to the\r\nJackson road, full three miles back of the city; thence in a\r\nsouthwesterly direction to the river.  Deep ravines of the description\r\ngiven lay in front of these defences.  As there is a succession of\r\ngullies, cut out by rains along the side of the ridge, the line was\r\nnecessarily very irregular.  To follow each of these spurs with\r\nintrenchments, so as to command the slopes on either side, would have\r\nlengthened their line very much. Generally therefore, or in many places,\r\ntheir line would run from near the head of one gully nearly straight to\r\nthe head of another, and an outer work triangular in shape, generally\r\nopen in the rear, was thrown up on the point; with a few men in this\r\nouter work they commanded the approaches to the main line completely.\r\n\r\nThe work to be done, to make our position as strong against the enemy as\r\nhis was against us, was very great.  The problem was also complicated by\r\nour wanting our line as near that of the enemy as possible.  We had but\r\nfour engineer officers with us. Captain Prime, of the Engineer Corps,\r\nwas the chief, and the work at the beginning was mainly directed by him.\r\nHis health soon gave out, when he was succeeded by Captain Comstock,\r\nalso of the Engineer Corps.  To provide assistants on such a long line I\r\ndirected that all officers who had graduated at West Point, where they\r\nhad necessarily to study military engineering, should in addition to\r\ntheir other duties assist in the work.\r\n\r\nThe chief quartermaster and the chief commissary were graduates.  The\r\nchief commissary, now the Commissary-General of the Army, begged off,\r\nhowever, saying that there was nothing in engineering that he was good\r\nfor unless he would do for a sap-roller.  As soldiers require rations\r\nwhile working in the ditches as well as when marching and fighting, and\r\nas we would be sure to lose him if he was used as a sap-roller, I let\r\nhim off.  The general is a large man; weighs two hundred and twenty\r\npounds, and is not tall.\r\n\r\nWe had no siege guns except six thirty-two pounders, and there were none\r\nat the West to draw from.  Admiral Porter, however, supplied us with a\r\nbattery of navy-guns of large calibre, and with these, and the field\r\nartillery used in the campaign, the siege began.  The first thing to do\r\nwas to get the artillery in batteries where they would occupy commanding\r\npositions; then establish the camps, under cover from the fire of the\r\nenemy but as near up as possible; and then construct rifle-pits and\r\ncovered ways, to connect the entire command by the shortest route.  The\r\nenemy did not harass us much while we were constructing our batteries.\r\nProbably their artillery ammunition was short; and their infantry was\r\nkept down by our sharpshooters, who were always on the alert and ready\r\nto fire at a head whenever it showed itself above the rebel works.\r\n\r\nIn no place were our lines more than six hundred yards from the enemy.\r\nIt was necessary, therefore, to cover our men by something more than\r\nthe ordinary parapet.  To give additional protection sand bags,\r\nbullet-proof, were placed along the tops of the parapets far enough\r\napart to make loop-holes for musketry.  On top of these, logs were put.\r\nBy these means the men were enabled to walk about erect when off duty,\r\nwithout fear of annoyance from sharpshooters.  The enemy used in their\r\ndefence explosive musket-balls, no doubt thinking that, bursting over\r\nour men in the trenches, they would do some execution; but I do not\r\nremember a single case where a man was injured by a piece of one of\r\nthese shells. When they were hit and the ball exploded, the wound was\r\nterrible.  In these cases a solid ball would have hit as well.  Their\r\nuse is barbarous, because they produce increased suffering without any\r\ncorresponding advantage to those using them.\r\n\r\nThe enemy could not resort to our method to protect their men, because\r\nwe had an inexhaustible supply of ammunition to draw upon and used it\r\nfreely.  Splinters from the timber would have made havoc among the men\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThere were no mortars with the besiegers, except what the navy had in\r\nfront of the city; but wooden ones were made by taking logs of the\r\ntoughest wood that could be found, boring them out for six or twelve\r\npound shells and binding them with strong iron bands.  These answered as\r\ncoehorns, and shells were successfully thrown from them into the\r\ntrenches of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe labor of building the batteries and intrenching was largely done by\r\nthe pioneers, assisted by negroes who came within our lines and who were\r\npaid for their work; but details from the troops had often to be made.\r\nThe work was pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and when an advanced\r\nposition was secured and covered from the fire of the enemy the\r\nbatteries were advanced.  By the 30th of June there were two hundred and\r\ntwenty guns in position, mostly light field-pieces, besides a battery of\r\nheavy guns belonging to, manned and commanded by the navy.  We were now\r\nas strong for defence against the garrison of Vicksburg as they were\r\nagainst us; but I knew that Johnston was in our rear, and was receiving\r\nconstant reinforcements from the east. He had at this time a larger\r\nforce than I had had at any time prior to the battle of Champion's Hill.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of the arrival of the Union army behind Vicksburg\r\nreached the North, floods of visitors began to pour in.  Some came to\r\ngratify curiosity; some to see sons or brothers who had passed through\r\nthe terrible ordeal; members of the Christian and Sanitary Associations\r\ncame to minister to the wants of the sick and the wounded.  Often those\r\ncoming to see a son or brother would bring a dozen or two of poultry.\r\nThey did not know how little the gift would be appreciated.  Many of the\r\nsoldiers had lived so much on chickens, ducks and turkeys without bread\r\nduring the march, that the sight of poultry, if they could get bacon,\r\nalmost took away their appetite.  But the intention was good.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest arrivals was the Governor of Illinois, with most of\r\nthe State officers.  I naturally wanted to show them what there was of\r\nmost interest.  In Sherman's front the ground was the most broken and\r\nmost wooded, and more was to be seen without exposure.  I therefore took\r\nthem to Sherman's headquarters and presented them.  Before starting out\r\nto look at the lines--possibly while Sherman's horse was being saddled\r\n--there were many questions asked about the late campaign, about which\r\nthe North had been so imperfectly informed.  There was a little knot\r\naround Sherman and another around me, and I heard Sherman repeating, in\r\nthe most animated manner, what he had said to me when we first looked\r\ndown from Walnut Hills upon the land below on the 18th of May, adding:\r\n\"Grant is entitled to every bit of the credit for the campaign; I\r\nopposed it. I wrote him a letter about it.\"  But for this speech it is\r\nnot likely that Sherman's opposition would have ever been heard of.  His\r\nuntiring energy and great efficiency during the campaign entitle him to\r\na full share of all the credit due for its success.  He could not have\r\ndone more if the plan had been his own. (*13)\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of May I sent Blair's division up the Yazoo to drive out a\r\nforce of the enemy supposed to be between the Big Black and the Yazoo.\r\nThe country was rich and full of supplies of both food and forage.\r\nBlair was instructed to take all of it.  The cattle were to be driven in\r\nfor the use of our army, and the food and forage to be consumed by our\r\ntroops or destroyed by fire; all bridges were to be destroyed, and the\r\nroads rendered as nearly impassable as possible.  Blair went forty-five\r\nmiles and was gone almost a week.  His work was effectually done.  I\r\nrequested Porter at this time to send the marine brigade, a floating\r\nnondescript force which had been assigned to his command and which\r\nproved very useful, up to Haines' Bluff to hold it until reinforcements\r\ncould be sent.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th I also received a letter from Banks, asking me to reinforce\r\nhim with ten thousand men at Port Hudson.  Of course I could not comply\r\nwith his request, nor did I think he needed them.  He was in no danger\r\nof an attack by the garrison in his front, and there was no army\r\norganizing in his rear to raise the siege.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of June a brigade from Hurlbut's command arrived, General\r\nKimball commanding.  It was sent to Mechanicsburg, some miles north-east\r\nof Haines' Bluff and about midway between the Big Black and the Yazoo.\r\nA brigade of Blair's division and twelve hundred cavalry had already, on\r\nBlair's return from the Yazoo, been sent to the same place with\r\ninstructions to watch the crossings of the Big Black River, to destroy\r\nthe roads in his (Blair's) front, and to gather or destroy all supplies.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of June our little force of colored and white troops across\r\nthe Mississippi, at Milliken's Bend, were attacked by about 3,000 men\r\nfrom Richard Taylor's trans-Mississippi command.  With the aid of the\r\ngunboats they were speedily repelled.  I sent Mower's brigade over with\r\ninstructions to drive the enemy beyond the Tensas Bayou; and we had no\r\nfurther trouble in that quarter during the siege.  This was the first\r\nimportant engagement of the war in which colored troops were under fire.\r\nThese men were very raw, having all been enlisted since the beginning of\r\nthe siege, but they behaved well.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of June a full division arrived from Hurlbut's command, under\r\nGeneral Sooy Smith.  It was sent immediately to Haines' Bluff, and\r\nGeneral C. C. Washburn was assigned to the general command at that\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th a strong division arrived from the Department of the\r\nMissouri under General Herron, which was placed on our left. This cut\r\noff the last possible chance of communication between Pemberton and\r\nJohnston, as it enabled Lauman to close up on McClernand's left while\r\nHerron intrenched from Lauman to the water's edge.  At this point the\r\nwater recedes a few hundred yards from the high land.  Through this\r\nopening no doubt the Confederate commanders had been able to get\r\nmessengers under cover of night.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th General Parke arrived with two divisions of Burnside's\r\ncorps, and was immediately dispatched to Haines' Bluff.  These latter\r\ntroops--Herron's and Parke's--were the reinforcements already spoken of\r\nsent by Halleck in anticipation of their being needed.  They arrived\r\nnone too soon.\r\n\r\nI now had about seventy-one thousand men.  More than half were disposed\r\nacross the peninsula, between the Yazoo at Haines' Bluff and the Big\r\nBlack, with the division of Osterhaus watching the crossings of the\r\nlatter river farther south and west from the crossing of the Jackson\r\nroad to Baldwin's ferry and below.\r\n\r\nThere were eight roads leading into Vicksburg, along which and their\r\nimmediate sides, our work was specially pushed and batteries advanced;\r\nbut no commanding point within range of the enemy was neglected.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th I received a letter from General Sherman and one on the 18th\r\nfrom General McPherson, saying that their respective commands had\r\ncomplained to them of a fulsome, congratulatory order published by\r\nGeneral McClernand to the 13th corps, which did great injustice to the\r\nother troops engaged in the campaign.  This order had been sent North\r\nand published, and now papers containing it had reached our camps.  The\r\norder had not been heard of by me, and certainly not by troops outside\r\nof McClernand's command until brought in this way.  I at once wrote to\r\nMcClernand, directing him to send me a copy of this order.  He did so,\r\nand I at once relieved him from the command of the 13th army corps and\r\nordered him back to Springfield, Illinois.  The publication of his order\r\nin the press was in violation of War Department orders and also of mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nJOHNSTON'S MOVEMENTS--FORTIFICATIONS AT HAINES' BLUFF--EXPLOSION OF THE\r\nMINE--EXPLOSION OF THE SECOND MINE--PREPARING FOR THE ASSAULT--THE FLAG\r\nOF TRUCE--MEETING WITH PEMBERTON--NEGOTIATIONS FOR SURRENDER--ACCEPTING\r\nTHE TERMS--SURRENDER OF VICKSBURG.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of June positive information was received that Johnston had\r\ncrossed the Big Black River for the purpose of attacking our rear, to\r\nraise the siege and release Pemberton. The correspondence between\r\nJohnston and Pemberton shows that all expectation of holding Vicksburg\r\nhad by this time passed from Johnston's mind.  I immediately ordered\r\nSherman to the command of all the forces from Haines' Bluff to the Big\r\nBlack River. This amounted now to quite half the troops about Vicksburg.\r\nBesides these, Herron and A. J. Smith's divisions were ordered to hold\r\nthemselves in readiness to reinforce Sherman.  Haines' Bluff had been\r\nstrongly fortified on the land side, and on all commanding points from\r\nthere to the Big Black at the railroad crossing batteries had been\r\nconstructed.  The work of connecting by rifle-pits where this was not\r\nalready done, was an easy task for the troops that were to defend them.\r\n\r\nWe were now looking west, besieging Pemberton, while we were also\r\nlooking east to defend ourselves against an expected siege by Johnston.\r\nBut as against the garrison of Vicksburg we were as substantially\r\nprotected as they were against us.  Where we were looking east and north\r\nwe were strongly fortified, and on the defensive.  Johnston evidently\r\ntook in the situation and wisely, I think, abstained from making an\r\nassault on us because it would simply have inflicted loss on both sides\r\nwithout accomplishing any result.  We were strong enough to have taken\r\nthe offensive against him; but I did not feel disposed to take any risk\r\nof losing our hold upon Pemberton's army, while I would have rejoiced at\r\nthe opportunity of defending ourselves against an attack by Johnston.\r\n\r\nFrom the 23d of May the work of fortifying and pushing forward our\r\nposition nearer to the enemy had been steadily progressing.  At three\r\npoints on the Jackson road, in front of Leggett's brigade, a sap was run\r\nup to the enemy's parapet, and by the 25th of June we had it undermined\r\nand the mine charged. The enemy had countermined, but did not succeed in\r\nreaching our mine.  At this particular point the hill on which the rebel\r\nwork stands rises abruptly.  Our sap ran close up to the outside of the\r\nenemy's parapet.  In fact this parapet was also our protection.  The\r\nsoldiers of the two sides occasionally conversed pleasantly across this\r\nbarrier; sometimes they exchanged the hard bread of the Union soldiers\r\nfor the tobacco of the Confederates; at other times the enemy threw over\r\nhand-grenades, and often our men, catching them in their hands, returned\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOur mine had been started some distance back down the hill; consequently\r\nwhen it had extended as far as the parapet it was many feet below it.\r\nThis caused the failure of the enemy in his search to find and destroy\r\nit.  On the 25th of June at three o'clock, all being ready, the mine was\r\nexploded.  A heavy artillery fire all along the line had been ordered to\r\nopen with the explosion.  The effect was to blow the top of the hill off\r\nand make a crater where it stood.  The breach was not sufficient to\r\nenable us to pass a column of attack through.  In fact, the enemy having\r\nfailed to reach our mine had thrown up a line farther back, where most\r\nof the men guarding that point were placed.  There were a few men,\r\nhowever, left at the advance line, and others working in the\r\ncountermine, which was still being pushed to find ours.  All that were\r\nthere were thrown into the air, some of them coming down on our side,\r\nstill alive.  I remember one colored man, who had been under ground at\r\nwork when the explosion took place, who was thrown to our side.  He was\r\nnot much hurt, but terribly frightened.  Some one asked him how high he\r\nhad gone up.  \"Dun no, massa, but t'ink 'bout t'ree mile,\" was his\r\nreply.  General Logan commanded at this point and took this colored man\r\nto his quarters, where he did service to the end of the siege.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the explosion took place the crater was seized by two\r\nregiments of our troops who were near by, under cover, where they had\r\nbeen placed for the express purpose.  The enemy made a desperate effort\r\nto expel them, but failed, and soon retired behind the new line.  From\r\nhere, however, they threw hand-grenades, which did some execution.  The\r\ncompliment was returned by our men, but not with so much effect.  The\r\nenemy could lay their grenades on the parapet, which alone divided the\r\ncontestants, and roll them down upon us; while from our side they had to\r\nbe thrown over the parapet, which was at considerable elevation.  During\r\nthe night we made efforts to secure our position in the crater against\r\nthe missiles of the enemy, so as to run trenches along the outer base of\r\ntheir parapet, right and left; but the enemy continued throwing their\r\ngrenades, and brought boxes of field ammunition (shells), the fuses of\r\nwhich they would light with portfires, and throw them by hand into our\r\nranks.  We found it impossible to continue this work.  Another mine was\r\nconsequently started which was exploded on the 1st of July, destroying\r\nan entire rebel redan, killing and wounding a considerable number of its\r\noccupants and leaving an immense chasm where it stood.  No attempt to\r\ncharge was made this time, the experience of the 25th admonishing us.\r\nOur loss in the first affair was about thirty killed and wounded.  The\r\nenemy must have lost more in the two explosions than we did in the\r\nfirst.  We lost none in the second.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the work of mining and pushing our position\r\nnearer to the enemy was prosecuted with vigor, and I determined to\r\nexplode no more mines until we were ready to explode a number at\r\ndifferent points and assault immediately after.  We were up now at three\r\ndifferent points, one in front of each corps, to where only the parapet\r\nof the enemy divided us.\r\n\r\nAt this time an intercepted dispatch from Johnston to Pemberton informed\r\nme that Johnston intended to make a determined attack upon us in order\r\nto relieve the garrison at Vicksburg.  I knew the garrison would make no\r\nformidable effort to relieve itself.  The picket lines were so close to\r\neach other--where there was space enough between the lines to post\r\npickets--that the men could converse.  On the 21st of June I was\r\ninformed, through this means, that Pemberton was preparing to escape, by\r\ncrossing to the Louisiana side under cover of night; that he had\r\nemployed workmen in making boats for that purpose; that the men had been\r\ncanvassed to ascertain if they would make an assault on the \"Yankees\" to\r\ncut their way out; that they had refused, and almost mutinied, because\r\ntheir commander would not surrender and relieve their sufferings, and\r\nhad only been pacified by the assurance that boats enough would be\r\nfinished in a week to carry them all over.  The rebel pickets also said\r\nthat houses in the city had been pulled down to get material to build\r\nthese boats with.  Afterwards this story was verified:  on entering the\r\ncity we found a large number of very rudely constructed boats.\r\n\r\nAll necessary steps were at once taken to render such an attempt\r\nabortive.  Our pickets were doubled; Admiral Porter was notified, so\r\nthat the river might be more closely watched; material was collected on\r\nthe west bank of the river to be set on fire and light up the river if\r\nthe attempt was made; and batteries were established along the levee\r\ncrossing the peninsula on the Louisiana side.  Had the attempt been made\r\nthe garrison of Vicksburg would have been drowned, or made prisoners on\r\nthe Louisiana side.  General Richard Taylor was expected on the west\r\nbank to co-operate in this movement, I believe, but he did not come, nor\r\ncould he have done so with a force sufficient to be of service.  The\r\nMississippi was now in our possession from its source to its mouth,\r\nexcept in the immediate front of Vicksburg and of Port Hudson.  We had\r\nnearly exhausted the country, along a line drawn from Lake Providence to\r\nopposite Bruinsburg.  The roads west were not of a character to draw\r\nsupplies over for any considerable force.\r\n\r\nBy the 1st of July our approaches had reached the enemy's ditch at a\r\nnumber of places.  At ten points we could move under cover to within\r\nfrom five to one hundred yards of the enemy.  Orders were given to make\r\nall preparations for assault on the 6th of July.  The debouches were\r\nordered widened to afford easy egress, while the approaches were also to\r\nbe widened to admit the troops to pass through four abreast.  Plank, and\r\nbags filled with cotton packed in tightly, were ordered prepared, to\r\nenable the troops to cross the ditches.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 1st of July Johnston was between Brownsville and the\r\nBig Black, and wrote Pemberton from there that about the 7th of the\r\nmonth an attempt would be made to create a diversion to enable him to\r\ncut his way out.  Pemberton was a prisoner before this message reached\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOn July 1st Pemberton, seeing no hope of outside relief, addressed the\r\nfollowing letter to each of his four division commanders:\r\n\r\n\"Unless the siege of Vicksburg is raised, or supplies are thrown in, it\r\nwill become necessary very shortly to evacuate the place.  I see no\r\nprospect of the former, and there are many great, if not insuperable\r\nobstacles in the way of the latter. You are, therefore, requested to\r\ninform me with as little delay as possible, as to the condition of your\r\ntroops and their ability to make the marches and undergo the fatigues\r\nnecessary to accomplish a successful evacuation.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of his generals suggested surrender, and the other two practically\r\ndid the same.  They expressed the opinion that an attempt to evacuate\r\nwould fail.  Pemberton had previously got a message to Johnston\r\nsuggesting that he should try to negotiate with me for a release of the\r\ngarrison with their arms.  Johnston replied that it would be a\r\nconfession of weakness for him to do so; but he authorized Pemberton to\r\nuse his name in making such an arrangement.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d about ten o'clock A.M. white flags appeared on a portion of\r\nthe rebel works.  Hostilities along that part of the line ceased at\r\nonce.  Soon two persons were seen coming towards our lines bearing a\r\nwhite flag.  They proved to be General Bowen, a division commander, and\r\nColonel Montgomery, aide-de-camp to Pemberton, bearing the following\r\nletter to me:\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to propose an armistice for--hours, with the view to\r\narranging terms for the capitulation of Vicksburg.  To this end, if\r\nagreeable to you, I will appoint three commissioners, to meet a like\r\nnumber to be named by yourself at such place and hour to-day as you may\r\nfind convenient.  I make this proposition to save the further effusion\r\nof blood, which must otherwise be shed to a frightful extent, feeling\r\nmyself fully able to maintain my position for a yet indefinite period.\r\nThis communication will be handed you under a flag of truce, by\r\nMajor-General John S. Bowen.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious sight to officers and soldiers on the line where these\r\nwhite flags were visible, and the news soon spread to all parts of the\r\ncommand.  The troops felt that their long and weary marches, hard\r\nfighting, ceaseless watching by night and day, in a hot climate,\r\nexposure to all sorts of weather, to diseases and, worst of all, to the\r\ngibes of many Northern papers that came to them saying all their\r\nsuffering was in vain, that Vicksburg would never be taken, were at last\r\nat an end and the Union sure to be saved.\r\n\r\nBowen was received by General A. J. Smith, and asked to see me.  I had\r\nbeen a neighbor of Bowen's in Missouri, and knew him well and favorably\r\nbefore the war; but his request was refused.  He then suggested that I\r\nshould meet Pemberton.  To this I sent a verbal message saying that, if\r\nPemberton desired it, I would meet him in front of McPherson's corps at\r\nthree o'clock that afternoon.  I also sent the following written reply\r\nto Pemberton's letter:\r\n\r\n\"Your note of this date is just received, proposing an armistice for\r\nseveral hours, for the purpose of arranging terms of capitulation\r\nthrough commissioners, to be appointed, etc.  The useless effusion of\r\nblood you propose stopping by this course can be ended at any time you\r\nmay choose, by the unconditional surrender of the city and garrison.\r\nMen who have shown so much endurance and courage as those now in\r\nVicksburg, will always challenge the respect of an adversary, and I can\r\nassure you will be treated with all the respect due to prisoners of war.\r\nI do not favor the proposition of appointing commissioners to arrange\r\nthe terms of capitulation, because I have no terms other than those\r\nindicated above.\"\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock Pemberton appeared at the point suggested in my verbal\r\nmessage, accompanied by the same officers who had borne his letter of\r\nthe morning.  Generals Ord, McPherson, Logan and A. J. Smith, and\r\nseveral officers of my staff, accompanied me. Our place of meeting was\r\non a hillside within a few hundred feet of the rebel lines.  Near by\r\nstood a stunted oak-tree, which was made historical by the event.  It\r\nwas but a short time before the last vestige of its body, root and limb\r\nhad disappeared, the fragments taken as trophies.  Since then the same\r\ntree has furnished as many cords of wood, in the shape of trophies, as\r\n\"The True Cross.\"\r\n\r\nPemberton and I had served in the same division during part of the\r\nMexican War.  I knew him very well therefore, and greeted him as an old\r\nacquaintance.  He soon asked what terms I proposed to give his army if\r\nit surrendered.  My answer was the same as proposed in my reply to his\r\nletter.  Pemberton then said, rather snappishly, \"The conference might\r\nas well end,\" and turned abruptly as if to leave.  I said, \"Very well.\"\r\nGeneral Bowen, I saw, was very anxious that the surrender should be\r\nconsummated. His manner and remarks while Pemberton and I were talking,\r\nshowed this.  He now proposed that he and one of our generals should\r\nhave a conference.  I had no objection to this, as nothing could be made\r\nbinding upon me that they might propose. Smith and Bowen accordingly had\r\na conference, during which Pemberton and I, moving a short distance away\r\ntowards the enemy's lines were in conversation.  After a while Bowen\r\nsuggested that the Confederate army should be allowed to march out with\r\nthe honors of war, carrying their small arms and field artillery.  This\r\nwas promptly and unceremoniously rejected.  The interview here ended, I\r\nagreeing, however, to send a letter giving final terms by ten o'clock\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nWord was sent to Admiral Porter soon after the correspondence with\r\nPemberton commenced, so that hostilities might be stopped on the part of\r\nboth army and navy.  It was agreed on my paging with Pemberton that they\r\nshould not be renewed until our correspondence ceased.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to my headquarters I sent for all the corps and division\r\ncommanders with the army immediately confronting Vicksburg.  Half the\r\narmy was from eight to twelve miles off, waiting for Johnston.  I\r\ninformed them of the contents of Pemberton's letters, of my reply and\r\nthe substance of the interview, and that I was ready to hear any\r\nsuggestion; but would hold the power of deciding entirely in my own\r\nhands.  This was the nearest approach to a \"council of war\" I ever held.\r\nAgainst the general, and almost unanimous judgment of the council I sent\r\nthe following letter:\r\n\r\n\"In conformity with agreement of this afternoon, I will submit the\r\nfollowing proposition for the surrender of the City of Vicksburg, public\r\nstores, etc.  On your accepting the terms proposed, I will march in one\r\ndivision as a guard, and take possession at eight A.M. to-morrow.  As\r\nsoon as rolls can be made out, and paroles be signed by officers and\r\nmen, you will be allowed to march out of our lines, the officers taking\r\nwith them their side-arms and clothing, and the field, staff and cavalry\r\nofficers one horse each.  The rank and file will be allowed all their\r\nclothing, but no other property.  If these conditions are accepted, any\r\namount of rations you may deem necessary can be taken from the stores\r\nyou now have, and also the necessary cooking utensils for preparing\r\nthem.  Thirty wagons also, counting two two-horse or mule teams as one,\r\nwill be allowed to transport such articles as cannot be carried along.\r\nThe same conditions will be allowed to all sick and wounded officers and\r\nsoldiers as fast as they become able to travel.  The paroles for these\r\nlatter must be signed, however, whilst officers present are authorized\r\nto sign the roll of prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the cartel then in force, prisoners captured by either\r\narmy were required to be forwarded as soon as possible to either Aiken's\r\nlanding below Dutch Gap on the James River, or to Vicksburg, there to be\r\nexchanged, or paroled until they could be exchanged.  There was a\r\nConfederate commissioner at Vicksburg, authorized to make the exchange.\r\nI did not propose to take him a prisoner, but to leave him free to\r\nperform the functions of his office.  Had I insisted upon an\r\nunconditional surrender there would have been over thirty thousand men\r\nto transport to Cairo, very much to the inconvenience of the army on the\r\nMississippi.  Thence the prisoners would have had to be transported by\r\nrail to Washington or Baltimore; thence again by steamer to Aiken's--all\r\nat very great expense.  At Aiken's they would have had to be paroled,\r\nbecause the Confederates did not have Union prisoners to give in\r\nexchange.  Then again Pemberton's army was largely composed of men whose\r\nhomes were in the South-west; I knew many of them were tired of the war\r\nand would get home just as soon as they could.  A large number of them\r\nhad voluntarily come into our lines during the siege, and requested to\r\nbe sent north where they could get employment until the war was over and\r\nthey could go to their homes.\r\n\r\nLate at night I received the following reply to my last letter:\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of\r\nthis date, proposing terms of capitulation for this garrison and post.\r\nIn the main your terms are accepted; but, in justice both to the honor\r\nand spirit of my troops manifested in the defence of Vicksburg, I have\r\nto submit the following amendments, which, if acceded to by you, will\r\nperfect the agreement between us.  At ten o'clock A.M. to-morrow, I\r\npropose to evacuate the works in and around Vicksburg, and to surrender\r\nthe city and garrison under my command, by marching out with my colors\r\nand arms, stacking them in front of my present lines.  After which you\r\nwill take possession.  Officers to retain their side-arms and personal\r\nproperty, and the rights and property of citizens to be respected.\"\r\n\r\nThis was received after midnight.  My reply was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of 3d\r\nJuly.  The amendment proposed by you cannot be acceded to in full.  It\r\nwill be necessary to furnish every officer and man with a parole signed\r\nby himself, which, with the completion of the roll of prisoners, will\r\nnecessarily take some time.  Again, I can make no stipulations with\r\nregard to the treatment of citizens and their private property.  While I\r\ndo not propose to cause them any undue annoyance or loss, I cannot\r\nconsent to leave myself under any restraint by stipulations. The\r\nproperty which officers will be allowed to take with them will be as\r\nstated in my proposition of last evening; that is, officers will be\r\nallowed their private baggage and side-arms, and mounted officers one\r\nhorse each.  If you mean by your proposition for each brigade to march\r\nto the front of the lines now occupied by it, and stack arms at ten\r\no'clock A.M., and then return to the inside and there remain as\r\nprisoners until properly paroled, I will make no objection to it.\r\nShould no notification be received of your acceptance of my terms by\r\nnine o'clock A.M. I shall regard them as having been rejected, and shall\r\nact accordingly.  Should these terms be accepted, white flags should be\r\ndisplayed along your lines to prevent such of my troops as may not have\r\nbeen notified, from firing upon your men.\"\r\n\r\nPemberton promptly accepted these terms.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege there had been a good deal of friendly sparring between\r\nthe soldiers of the two armies, on picket and where the lines were close\r\ntogether.  All rebels were known as \"Johnnies,\" all Union troops as\r\n\"Yanks.\"  Often \"Johnny\" would call:  \"Well, Yank, when are you coming\r\ninto town?\"  The reply was sometimes: \"We propose to celebrate the 4th\r\nof July there.\"  Sometimes it would be:  \"We always treat our prisoners\r\nwith kindness and do not want to hurt them;\" or, \"We are holding you as\r\nprisoners of war while you are feeding yourselves.\"  The garrison, from\r\nthe commanding general down, undoubtedly expected an assault on the\r\nfourth.  They knew from the temper of their men it would be successful\r\nwhen made; and that would be a greater humiliation than to surrender.\r\nBesides it would be attended with severe loss to them.\r\n\r\nThe Vicksburg paper, which we received regularly through the courtesy of\r\nthe rebel pickets, said prior to the fourth, in speaking of the \"Yankee\"\r\nboast that they would take dinner in Vicksburg that day, that the best\r\nreceipt for cooking a rabbit was \"First ketch your rabbit.\"  The paper\r\nat this time and for some time previous was printed on the plain side of\r\nwall paper.  The last number was issued on the fourth and announced that\r\nwe had \"caught our rabbit.\"\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that Pemberton commenced his correspondence on the third\r\nwith a two-fold purpose:  first, to avoid an assault, which he knew\r\nwould be successful, and second, to prevent the capture taking place on\r\nthe great national holiday, the anniversary of the Declaration of\r\nAmerican Independence. Holding out for better terms as he did he\r\ndefeated his aim in the latter particular.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour the garrison of Vicksburg marched out of their\r\nworks and formed line in front, stacked arms and marched back in good\r\norder.  Our whole army present witnessed this scene without cheering.\r\nLogan's division, which had approached nearest the rebel works, was the\r\nfirst to march in; and the flag of one of the regiments of his division\r\nwas soon floating over the court-house.  Our soldiers were no sooner\r\ninside the lines than the two armies began to fraternize.  Our men had\r\nhad full rations from the time the siege commenced, to the close.  The\r\nenemy had been suffering, particularly towards the last.  I myself saw\r\nour men taking bread from their haversacks and giving it to the enemy\r\nthey had so recently been engaged in starving out.  It was accepted with\r\navidity and with thanks.\r\n\r\nPemberton says in his report:\r\n\r\n\"If it should be asked why the 4th of July was selected as the day for\r\nsurrender, the answer is obvious.  I believed that upon that day I\r\nshould obtain better terms.  Well aware of the vanity of our foe, I knew\r\nthey would attach vast importance to the entrance on the 4th of July\r\ninto the stronghold of the great river, and that, to gratify their\r\nnational vanity, they would yield then what could not be extorted from\r\nthem at any other time.\"\r\n\r\nThis does not support my view of his reasons for selecting the day he\r\ndid for surrendering.  But it must be recollected that his first letter\r\nasking terms was received about 10 o'clock A.M., July 3d.  It then could\r\nhardly be expected that it would take twenty-four hours to effect a\r\nsurrender.  He knew that Johnston was in our rear for the purpose of\r\nraising the siege, and he naturally would want to hold out as long as he\r\ncould.  He knew his men would not resist an assault, and one was\r\nexpected on the fourth.  In our interview he told me he had rations\r\nenough to hold out for some time--my recollection is two weeks.  It was\r\nthis statement that induced me to insert in the terms that he was to\r\ndraw rations for his men from his own supplies.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July General Holmes, with an army of eight or nine\r\nthousand men belonging to the trans-Mississippi department, made an\r\nattack upon Helena, Arkansas.  He was totally defeated by General\r\nPrentiss, who was holding Helena with less than forty-two hundred\r\nsoldiers.  Holmes reported his loss at 1,636, of which 173 were killed;\r\nbut as Prentiss buried 400, Holmes evidently understated his losses.\r\nThe Union loss was 57 killed, 127 wounded, and between 30 and 40\r\nmissing.  This was the last effort on the part of the Confederacy to\r\nraise the siege of Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nOn the third, as soon as negotiations were commenced, I notified Sherman\r\nand directed him to be ready to take the offensive against Johnston,\r\ndrive him out of the State and destroy his army if he could.  Steele and\r\nOrd were directed at the same time to be in readiness to join Sherman as\r\nsoon as the surrender took place.  Of this Sherman was notified.\r\n\r\nI rode into Vicksburg with the troops, and went to the river to exchange\r\ncongratulations with the navy upon our joint victory. At that time I\r\nfound that many of the citizens had been living under ground.  The\r\nridges upon which Vicksburg is built, and those back to the Big Black,\r\nare composed of a deep yellow clay of great tenacity.  Where roads and\r\nstreets are cut through, perpendicular banks are left and stand as well\r\nas if composed of stone.  The magazines of the enemy were made by\r\nrunning passage-ways into this clay at places where there were deep\r\ncuts.  Many citizens secured places of safety for their families by\r\ncarving out rooms in these embankments.  A door-way in these cases would\r\nbe cut in a high bank, starting from the level of the road or street,\r\nand after running in a few feet a room of the size required was carved\r\nout of the clay, the dirt being removed by the door-way.  In some\r\ninstances I saw where two rooms were cut out, for a single family, with\r\na door-way in the clay wall separating them.  Some of these were\r\ncarpeted and furnished with considerable elaboration.  In these the\r\noccupants were fully secure from the shells of the navy, which were\r\ndropped into the city night and dav without intermission.\r\n\r\nI returned to my old headquarters outside in the afternoon, and did not\r\nmove into the town until the sixth.  On the afternoon of the fourth I\r\nsent Captain Wm. M. Dunn of my staff to Cairo, the nearest point where\r\nthe telegraph could be reached, with a dispatch to the general-in-chief.\r\nIt was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The enemy surrendered this morning.  The only terms allowed is their\r\nparole as prisoners of war.  This I regard as a great advantage to us at\r\nthis moment.  It saves, probably, several days in the capture, and\r\nleaves troops and transports ready for immediate service.  Sherman, with\r\na large force, moves immediately on Johnston, to drive him from the\r\nState.  I will send troops to the relief of Banks, and return the 9th\r\narmy corps to Burnside.\"\r\n\r\nThis news, with the victory at Gettysburg won the same day, lifted a\r\ngreat load of anxiety from the minds of the President, his Cabinet and\r\nthe loyal people all over the North.  The fate of the Confederacy was\r\nsealed when Vicksburg fell.  Much hard fighting was to be done\r\nafterwards and many precious lives were to be sacrificed; but the MORALE\r\nwas with the supporters of the Union ever after.\r\n\r\nI at the same time wrote to General Banks informing him of the fall and\r\nsending him a copy of the terms; also saying I would send him all the\r\ntroops he wanted to insure the capture of the only foothold the enemy\r\nnow had on the Mississippi River. General Banks had a number of copies\r\nof this letter printed, or at least a synopsis of it, and very soon a\r\ncopy fell into the hands of General Gardner, who was then in command of\r\nPort Hudson.  Gardner at once sent a letter to the commander of the\r\nNational forces saying that he had been informed of the surrender of\r\nVicksburg and telling how the information reached him.  He added that if\r\nthis was true, it was useless for him to hold out longer.  General Banks\r\ngave him assurances that Vicksburg had been surrendered, and General\r\nGardner surrendered unconditionally on the 9th of July.  Port Hudson\r\nwith nearly 6,000 prisoners, 51 guns, 5,000 small-arms and other stores\r\nfell into the hands of the Union forces:  from that day to the close of\r\nthe rebellion the Mississippi River, from its source to its mouth,\r\nremained in the control of the National troops.\r\n\r\nPemberton and his army were kept in Vicksburg until the whole could be\r\nparoled.  The paroles were in duplicate, by organization (one copy for\r\neach, Federals and Confederates), and signed by the commanding officers\r\nof the companies or regiments.  Duplicates were also made for each\r\nsoldier and signed by each individually, one to be retained by the\r\nsoldier signing and one to be retained by us.  Several hundred refused\r\nto sign their paroles, preferring to be sent to the North as prisoners\r\nto being sent back to fight again.  Others again kept out of the way,\r\nhoping to escape either alternative.\r\n\r\nPemberton appealed to me in person to compel these men to sign their\r\nparoles, but I declined.  It also leaked out that many of the men who\r\nhad signed their paroles, intended to desert and go to their homes as\r\nsoon as they got out of our lines.  Pemberton hearing this, again\r\nappealed to me to assist him.  He wanted arms for a battalion, to act as\r\nguards in keeping his men together while being marched to a camp of\r\ninstruction, where he expected to keep them until exchanged.  This\r\nrequest was also declined.  It was precisely what I expected and hoped\r\nthat they would do.  I told him, however, that I would see that they\r\nmarched beyond our lines in good order.  By the eleventh, just one week\r\nafter the surrender, the paroles were completed and the Confederate\r\ngarrison marched out.  Many deserted, and fewer of them were ever\r\nreturned to the ranks to fight again than would have been the case had\r\nthe surrender been unconditional and the prisoners sent to the James\r\nRiver to be paroled.\r\n\r\nAs soon as our troops took possession of the city guards were\r\nestablished along the whole line of parapet, from the river above to the\r\nriver below.  The prisoners were allowed to occupy their old camps\r\nbehind the intrenchments.  No restraint was put upon them, except by\r\ntheir own commanders.  They were rationed about as our own men, and from\r\nour supplies.  The men of the two armies fraternized as if they had been\r\nfighting for the same cause.  When they passed out of the works they had\r\nso long and so gallantly defended, between lines of their late\r\nantagonists, not a cheer went up, not a remark was made that would give\r\npain.  Really, I believe there was a feeling of sadness just then in the\r\nbreasts of most of the Union soldiers at seeing the dejection of their\r\nlate antagonists.\r\n\r\nThe day before the departure the following order was issued:\r\n\r\n\"Paroled prisoners will be sent out of here to-morrow.  They will be\r\nauthorized to cross at the railroad bridge, and move from there to\r\nEdward's Ferry, (*14) and on by way of Raymond. Instruct the commands to\r\nbe orderly and quiet as these prisoners pass, to make no offensive\r\nremarks, and not to harbor any who fall out of ranks after they have\r\npassed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nRETROSPECT OF THE CAMPAIGN--SHERMAN'S MOVEMENTS--PROPOSED MOVEMENT UPON\r\nMOBILE--A PAINFUL ACCIDENT--ORDERED TO REPORT AT CAIRO.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Vicksburg, with its garrison, ordnance and ordnance\r\nstores, and the successful battles fought in reaching them, gave new\r\nspirit to the loyal people of the North.  New hopes for the final\r\nsuccess of the cause of the Union were inspired.  The victory gained at\r\nGettysburg, upon the same day, added to their hopes.  Now the\r\nMississippi River was entirely in the possession of the National troops;\r\nfor the fall of Vicksburg gave us Port Hudson at once.  The army of\r\nnorthern Virginia was driven out of Pennsylvania and forced back to\r\nabout the same ground it occupied in 1861.  The Army of the Tennessee\r\nunited with the Army of the Gulf, dividing the Confederate States\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nThe first dispatch I received from the government after the fall of\r\nVicksburg was in these words:\r\n\r\n\"I fear your paroling the prisoners at Vicksburg, without actual\r\ndelivery to a proper agent as required by the seventh article of the\r\ncartel, may be construed into an absolute release, and that the men will\r\nimmediately be placed in the ranks of the enemy. Such has been the case\r\nelsewhere.  If these prisoners have not been allowed to depart, you will\r\ndetain them until further orders.\"\r\n\r\nHalleck did not know that they had already been delivered into the hands\r\nof Major Watts, Confederate commissioner for the exchange of prisoners.\r\n\r\nAt Vicksburg 31,600 prisoners were surrendered, together with 172 cannon\r\nabout 60,000 muskets and a large amount of ammunition.  The small-arms\r\nof the enemy were far superior to the bulk of ours.  Up to this time our\r\ntroops at the West had been limited to the old United States flint-lock\r\nmuskets changed into percussion, or the Belgian musket imported early in\r\nthe war--almost as dangerous to the person firing it as to the one aimed\r\nat--and a few new and improved arms.  These were of many different\r\ncalibers, a fact that caused much trouble in distributing ammunition\r\nduring an engagement.  The enemy had generally new arms which had run\r\nthe blockade and were of uniform caliber.  After the surrender I\r\nauthorized all colonels whose regiments were armed with inferior\r\nmuskets, to place them in the stack of captured arms and replace them\r\nwith the latter.  A large number of arms turned in to the Ordnance\r\nDepartment as captured, were thus arms that had really been used by the\r\nUnion army in the capture of Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nIn this narrative I have not made the mention I should like of officers,\r\ndead and alive, whose services entitle them to special mention.  Neither\r\nhave I made that mention of the navy which its services deserve.\r\nSuffice it to say, the close of the siege of Vicksburg found us with an\r\narmy unsurpassed, in proportion to its numbers, taken as a whole of\r\nofficers and men.  A military education was acquired which no other\r\nschool could have given. Men who thought a company was quite enough for\r\nthem to command properly at the beginning, would have made good\r\nregimental or brigade commanders; most of the brigade commanders were\r\nequal to the command of a division, and one, Ransom, would have been\r\nequal to the command of a corps at least. Logan and Crocker ended the\r\ncampaign fitted to command independent armies.\r\n\r\nGeneral F. P. Blair joined me at Milliken's Bend a full-fledged general,\r\nwithout having served in a lower grade.  He commanded a division in the\r\ncampaign.  I had known Blair in Missouri, where I had voted against him\r\nin 1858 when he ran for Congress.  I knew him as a frank, positive and\r\ngenerous man, true to his friends even to a fault, but always a leader.\r\nI dreaded his coming; I knew from experience that it was more difficult\r\nto command two generals desiring to be leaders than it was to command\r\none army officered intelligently and with subordination.  It affords me\r\nthe greatest pleasure to record now my agreeable disappointment in\r\nrespect to his character.  There was no man braver than he, nor was\r\nthere any who obeyed all orders of his superior in rank with more\r\nunquestioning alacrity.  He was one man as a soldier, another as a\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\nThe navy under Porter was all it could be, during the entire campaign.\r\nWithout its assistance the campaign could not have been successfully\r\nmade with twice the number of men engaged.  It could not have been made\r\nat all, in the way it was, with any number of men without such\r\nassistance.  The most perfect harmony reigned between the two arms of\r\nthe service.  There never was a request made, that I am aware of, either\r\nof the flag-officer or any of his subordinates, that was not promptly\r\ncomplied with.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of Vicksburg was suggested and developed by circumstances.\r\nThe elections of 1862 had gone against the prosecution of the war.\r\nVoluntary enlistments had nearly ceased and the draft had been resorted\r\nto; this was resisted, and a defeat or backward movement would have made\r\nits execution impossible.  A forward movement to a decisive victory was\r\nnecessary.  Accordingly I resolved to get below Vicksburg, unite with\r\nBanks against Port Hudson, make New Orleans a base and, with that base\r\nand Grand Gulf as a starting point, move our combined forces against\r\nVicksburg.  Upon reaching Grand Gulf, after running its batteries and\r\nfighting a battle, I received a letter from Banks informing me that he\r\ncould not be at Port Hudson under ten days, and then with only fifteen\r\nthousand men.  The time was worth more than the reinforcements; I\r\ntherefore determined to push into the interior of the enemy's country.\r\n\r\nWith a large river behind us, held above and below by the enemy, rapid\r\nmovements were essential to success.  Jackson was captured the day after\r\na new commander had arrived, and only a few days before large\r\nreinforcements were expected.  A rapid movement west was made; the\r\ngarrison of Vicksburg was met in two engagements and badly defeated, and\r\ndriven back into its stronghold and there successfully besieged.  It\r\nlooks now as though Providence had directed the course of the campaign\r\nwhile the Army of the Tennessee executed the decree.\r\n\r\nUpon the surrender of the garrison of Vicksburg there were three things\r\nthat required immediate attention.  The first was to send a force to\r\ndrive the enemy from our rear, and out of the State.  The second was to\r\nsend reinforcements to Banks near Port Hudson, if necessary, to complete\r\nthe triumph of opening the Mississippi from its source to its mouth to\r\nthe free navigation of vessels bearing the Stars and Stripes.  The third\r\nwas to inform the authorities at Washington and the North of the good\r\nnews, to relieve their long suspense and strengthen their confidence in\r\nthe ultimate success of the cause they had so much at heart.\r\n\r\nSoon after negotiations were opened with General Pemberton for the\r\nsurrender of the city, I notified Sherman, whose troops extended from\r\nHaines' Bluff on the left to the crossing of the Vicksburg and Jackson\r\nroad over the Big Black on the right, and directed him to hold his\r\ncommand in readiness to advance and drive the enemy from the State as\r\nsoon as Vicksburg surrendered.  Steele and Ord were directed to be in\r\nreadiness to join Sherman in his move against General Johnston, and\r\nSherman was advised of this also.  Sherman moved promptly, crossing the\r\nBig Black at three different points with as many columns, all\r\nconcentrating at Bolton, twenty miles west of Jackson.\r\n\r\nJohnston heard of the surrender of Vicksburg almost as soon as it\r\noccurred, and immediately fell back on Jackson.  On the 8th of July\r\nSherman was within ten miles of Jackson and on the 11th was close up to\r\nthe defences of the city and shelling the town.  The siege was kept up\r\nuntil the morning of the 17th, when it was found that the enemy had\r\nevacuated during the night.  The weather was very hot, the roads dusty\r\nand the water bad. Johnston destroyed the roads as he passed and had so\r\nmuch the start that pursuit was useless; but Sherman sent one division,\r\nSteele's, to Brandon, fourteen miles east of Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe National loss in the second capture of Jackson was less than one\r\nthousand men, killed, wounded and missing.  The Confederate loss was\r\nprobably less, except in captured.  More than this number fell into our\r\nhands as prisoners.\r\n\r\nMedicines and food were left for the Confederate wounded and sick who\r\nhad to be left behind.  A large amount of rations was issued to the\r\nfamilies that remained in Jackson.  Medicine and food were also sent to\r\nRaymond for the destitute families as well as the sick and wounded, as I\r\nthought it only fair that we should return to these people some of the\r\narticles we had taken while marching through the country.  I wrote to\r\nSherman: \"Impress upon the men the importance of going through the State\r\nin an orderly manner, abstaining from taking anything not absolutely\r\nnecessary for their subsistence while travelling. They should try to\r\ncreate as favorable an impression as possible upon the people.\"\r\nProvisions and forage, when called for by them, were issued to all the\r\npeople, from Bruinsburg to Jackson and back to Vicksburg, whose\r\nresources had been taken for the supply of our army.  Very large\r\nquantities of groceries and provisions were so issued.\r\n\r\nSherman was ordered back to Vicksburg, and his troops took much the same\r\nposition they had occupied before--from the Big Black to Haines' Bluff.\r\nHaving cleaned up about Vicksburg and captured or routed all regular\r\nConfederate forces for more than a hundred miles in all directions, I\r\nfelt that the troops that had done so much should be allowed to do more\r\nbefore the enemy could recover from the blow he had received, and while\r\nimportant points might be captured without bloodshed.  I suggested to\r\nthe General-in-chief the idea of a campaign against Mobile, starting\r\nfrom Lake Pontchartrain.  Halleck preferred another course.  The\r\npossession of the trans-Mississippi by the Union forces seemed to\r\npossess more importance in his mind than almost any campaign east of the\r\nMississippi.  I am well aware that the President was very anxious to\r\nhave a foothold in Texas, to stop the clamor of some of the foreign\r\ngovernments which seemed to be seeking a pretext to interfere in the\r\nwar, at least so far as to recognize belligerent rights to the\r\nConfederate States.  This, however, could have been easily done without\r\nwasting troops in western Louisiana and eastern Texas, by sending a\r\ngarrison at once to Brownsville on the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nHalleck disapproved of my proposition to go against Mobile, so that I\r\nwas obliged to settle down and see myself put again on the defensive as\r\nI had been a year before in west Tennessee.  It would have been an easy\r\nthing to capture Mobile at the time I proposed to go there.  Having that\r\nas a base of operations, troops could have been thrown into the interior\r\nto operate against General Bragg's army.  This would necessarily have\r\ncompelled Bragg to detach in order to meet this fire in his rear.  If he\r\nhad not done this the troops from Mobile could have inflicted\r\ninestimable damage upon much of the country from which his army and\r\nLee's were yet receiving their supplies.  I was so much impressed with\r\nthis idea that I renewed my request later in July and again about the\r\n1st of August, and proposed sending all the troops necessary, asking\r\nonly the assistance of the navy to protect the debarkation of troops at\r\nor near Mobile.  I also asked for a leave of absence to visit New\r\nOrleans, particularly if my suggestion to move against Mobile should be\r\napproved. Both requests were refused.  So far as my experience with\r\nGeneral Halleck went it was very much easier for him to refuse a favor\r\nthan to grant one.  But I did not regard this as a favor. It was simply\r\nin line of duty, though out of my department.\r\n\r\nThe General-in-chief having decided against me, the depletion of an\r\narmy, which had won a succession of great victories, commenced, as had\r\nbeen the case the year before after the fall of Corinth when the army\r\nwas sent where it would do the least good.  By orders, I sent to Banks a\r\nforce of 4,000 men; returned the 9th corps to Kentucky and, when\r\ntransportation had been collected, started a division of 5,000 men to\r\nSchofield in Missouri where Price was raiding the State.  I also\r\ndetached a brigade under Ransom to Natchez, to garrison that place\r\npermanently.  This latter move was quite fortunate as to the time when\r\nRansom arrived there.  The enemy happened to have a large number, about\r\n5,000 head, of beef cattle there on the way from Texas to feed the\r\nEastern armies, and also a large amount of munitions of war which had\r\nprobably come through Texas from the Rio Grande and which were on the\r\nway to Lee's and other armies in the East.\r\n\r\nThe troops that were left with me around Vicksburg were very busily and\r\nunpleasantly employed in making expeditions against guerilla bands and\r\nsmall detachments of cavalry which infested the interior, and in\r\ndestroying mills, bridges and rolling stock on the railroads.  The\r\nguerillas and cavalry were not there to fight but to annoy, and\r\ntherefore disappeared on the first approach of our troops.\r\n\r\nThe country back of Vicksburg was filled with deserters from Pemberton's\r\narmy and, it was reported, many from Johnston's also.  The men\r\ndetermined not to fight again while the war lasted.  Those who lived\r\nbeyond the reach of the Confederate army wanted to get to their homes.\r\nThose who did not, wanted to get North where they could work for their\r\nsupport till the war was over.  Besides all this there was quite a peace\r\nfeeling, for the time being, among the citizens of that part of\r\nMississippi, but this feeling soon subsided.  It is not probable that\r\nPemberton got off with over 4,000 of his army to the camp where he\r\nproposed taking them, and these were in a demoralized condition.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of August I further depleted my army by sending the 13th\r\ncorps, General Ord commanding, to Banks.  Besides this I received orders\r\nto co-operate with the latter general in movements west of the\r\nMississippi.  Having received this order I went to New Orleans to confer\r\nwith Banks about the proposed movement.  All these movements came to\r\nnaught.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit I reviewed Banks' army a short distance above\r\nCarrollton.  The horse I rode was vicious and but little used, and on my\r\nreturn to New Orleans ran away and, shying at a locomotive in the\r\nstreet, fell, probably on me.  I was rendered insensible, and when I\r\nregained consciousness I found myself in a hotel near by with several\r\ndoctors attending me.  My leg was swollen from the knee to the thigh,\r\nand the swelling, almost to the point of bursting, extended along the\r\nbody up to the arm-pit.  The pain was almost beyond endurance.  I lay at\r\nthe hotel something over a week without being able to turn myself in\r\nbed.  I had a steamer stop at the nearest point possible, and was\r\ncarried to it on a litter.  I was then taken to Vicksburg, where I\r\nremained unable to move for some time afterwards.\r\n\r\nWhile I was absent General Sherman declined to assume command because,\r\nhe said, it would confuse the records; but he let all the orders be made\r\nin my name, and was glad to render any assistance he could.  No orders\r\nwere issued by my staff, certainly no important orders, except upon\r\nconsultation with and approval of Sherman.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of September, while I was still in New Orleans, Halleck\r\ntelegraphed to me to send all available forces to Memphis and thence to\r\nTuscumbia, to co-operate with Rosecrans for the relief of Chattanooga.\r\nOn the 15th he telegraphed again for all available forces to go to\r\nRosecrans.  This was received on the 27th.  I was still confined to my\r\nbed, unable to rise from it without assistance; but I at once ordered\r\nSherman to send one division to Memphis as fast as transports could be\r\nprovided.  The division of McPherson's corps, which had got off and was\r\non the way to join Steele in Arkansas, was recalled and sent, likewise,\r\nto report to Hurlbut at Memphis.  Hurlbut was directed to forward these\r\ntwo divisions with two others from his own corps at once, and also to\r\nsend any other troops that might be returning there.  Halleck suggested\r\nthat some good man, like Sherman or McPherson, should be sent to Memphis\r\nto take charge of the troops going east. On this I sent Sherman, as\r\nbeing, I thought, the most suitable person for an independent command,\r\nand besides he was entitled to it if it had to be given to any one.  He\r\nwas directed to take with him another division of his corps.  This left\r\none back, but having one of McPherson's divisions he had still the\r\nequivalent.\r\n\r\nBefore the receipt by me of these orders the battle of Chickamauga had\r\nbeen fought and Rosecrans forced back into Chattanooga. The\r\nadministration as well as the General-in-chief was nearly frantic at the\r\nsituation of affairs there.  Mr. Charles A. Dana, an officer of the War\r\nDepartment, was sent to Rosecrans' headquarters.  I do not know what his\r\ninstructions were, but he was still in Chattanooga when I arrived there\r\nat a later period.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Halleck suggested that I should go to Nashville as soon as\r\nable to move and take general direction of the troops moving from the\r\nwest. I received the following dispatch dated October 3d:  \"It is the\r\nwish of the Secretary of War that as soon as General Grant is able he\r\nwill come to Cairo and report by telegraph.\"  I was still very lame, but\r\nstarted without delay.  Arriving at Columbus on the 16th I reported by\r\ntelegraph:  \"Your dispatch from Cairo of the 3d directing me to report\r\nfrom Cairo was received at 11.30 on the 10th.  Left the same day with\r\nstaff and headquarters and am here en route for Cairo.\"\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL MEMOIRS OF U. S.

I left Cairo within\r\nan hour or two after the receipt of this dispatch, going by rail via\r\nIndianapolis. Just as the train I was on was starting out of the depot\r\nat Indianapolis a messenger came running up to stop it, saying the\r\nSecretary of War was coming into the station and wanted to see me.\r\n\r\nI had never met Mr. Stanton up to that time, though we had held frequent\r\nconversations over the wires the year before, when I was in Tennessee.\r\nOccasionally at night he would order the wires between the War\r\nDepartment and my headquarters to be connected, and we would hold a\r\nconversation for an hour or two.  On this occasion the Secretary was\r\naccompanied by Governor Brough of Ohio, whom I had never met, though he\r\nand my father had been old acquaintances.  Mr. Stanton dismissed the\r\nspecial train that had brought him to Indianapolis, and accompanied me\r\nto Louisville.\r\n\r\nUp to this time no hint had been given me of what was wanted after I\r\nleft Vicksburg, except the suggestion in one of Halleck's dispatches\r\nthat I had better go to Nashville and superintend the operation of\r\ntroops sent to relieve Rosecrans. Soon after we started the Secretary\r\nhanded me two orders, saying that I might take my choice of them.  The\r\ntwo were identical in all but one particular.  Both created the\r\n\"Military Division of Mississippi,\" (giving me the command) composed of\r\nthe Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the Tennessee, and all\r\nthe territory from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi River north of\r\nBanks's command in the south-west.  One order left the department\r\ncommanders as they were, while the other relieved Rosecrans and assigned\r\nThomas to his place.  I accepted the latter.  We reached Louisville\r\nafter night and, if I remember rightly, in a cold, drizzling rain.  The\r\nSecretary of War told me afterwards that he caught a cold on that\r\noccasion from which he never expected to recover.  He never did.\r\n\r\nA day was spent in Louisville, the Secretary giving me the military news\r\nat the capital and talking about the disappointment at the results of\r\nsome of the campaigns.  By the evening of the day after our arrival all\r\nmatters of discussion seemed exhausted, and I left the hotel to spend\r\nthe evening away, both Mrs. Grant (who was with me) and myself having\r\nrelatives living in Louisville.  In the course of the evening Mr.\r\nStanton received a dispatch from Mr. C. A. Dana, then in Chattanooga,\r\ninforming him that unless prevented Rosecrans would retreat, and\r\nadvising peremptory orders against his doing so.\r\n\r\nAs stated before, after the fall of Vicksburg I urged strongly upon the\r\ngovernment the propriety of a movement against Mobile.  General\r\nRosecrans had been at Murfreesboro', Tennessee, with a large and\r\nwell-equipped army from early in the year 1863, with Bragg confronting\r\nhim with a force quite equal to his own at first, considering it was on\r\nthe defensive.  But after the investment of Vicksburg Bragg's army was\r\nlargely depleted to strengthen Johnston, in Mississippi, who was being\r\nreinforced to raise the siege.  I frequently wrote General Halleck\r\nsuggesting that Rosecrans should move against Bragg.  By so doing he\r\nwould either detain the latter's troops where they were or lay\r\nChattanooga open to capture.  General Halleck strongly approved the\r\nsuggestion, and finally wrote me that he had repeatedly ordered\r\nRosecrans to advance, but that the latter had constantly failed to\r\ncomply with the order, and at last, after having held a council of war,\r\nhad replied in effect that it was a military maxim \"not to fight two\r\ndecisive battles at the same time.\"  If true, the maxim was not\r\napplicable in this case.  It would be bad to be defeated in two decisive\r\nbattles fought the same day, but it would not be bad to win them.  I,\r\nhowever, was fighting no battle, and the siege of Vicksburg had drawn\r\nfrom Rosecrans' front so many of the enemy that his chances of victory\r\nwere much greater than they would be if he waited until the siege was\r\nover, when these troops could be returned.  Rosecrans was ordered to\r\nmove against the army that was detaching troops to raise the siege.\r\nFinally he did move, on the 24th of June, but ten days afterwards\r\nVicksburg surrendered, and the troops sent from Bragg were free to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that I recommended to the general-in-chief the\r\nmovement against Mobile.  I knew the peril the Army of the Cumberland\r\nwas in, being depleted continually, not only by ordinary casualties, but\r\nalso by having to detach troops to hold its constantly extending line\r\nover which to draw supplies, while the enemy in front was as constantly\r\nbeing strengthened.  Mobile was important to the enemy, and in the\r\nabsence of a threatening force was guarded by little else than\r\nartillery.  If threatened by land and from the water at the same time\r\nthe prize would fall easily, or troops would have to be sent to its\r\ndefence.  Those troops would necessarily come from Bragg.  My judgment\r\nwas overruled, and the troops under my command were dissipated over\r\nother parts of the country where it was thought they could render the\r\nmost service.\r\n\r\nSoon it was discovered in Washington that Rosecrans was in trouble and\r\nrequired assistance.  The emergency was now too immediate to allow us to\r\ngive this assistance by making an attack in rear of Bragg upon Mobile.\r\nIt was therefore necessary to reinforce directly, and troops were sent\r\nfrom every available point.\r\n\r\nRosecrans had very skilfully manoeuvred Bragg south of the Tennessee\r\nRiver, and through and beyond Chattanooga. If he had stopped and\r\nintrenched, and made himself strong there, all would have been right and\r\nthe mistake of not moving earlier partially compensated.  But he pushed\r\non, with his forces very much scattered, until Bragg's troops from\r\nMississippi began to join him.  Then Bragg took the initiative.\r\nRosecrans had to fall back in turn, and was able to get his army\r\ntogether at Chickamauga, some miles south-east of Chattanooga, before\r\nthe main battle was brought on.  The battle was fought on the 19th and\r\n20th of September, and Rosecrans was badly defeated, with a heavy loss\r\nin artillery and some sixteen thousand men killed, wounded and captured.\r\nThe corps under Major-General George H. Thomas stood its ground, while\r\nRosecrans, with Crittenden and McCook, returned to Chattanooga. Thomas\r\nreturned also, but later, and with his troops in good order.  Bragg\r\nfollowed and took possession of Missionary Ridge, overlooking\r\nChattanooga. He also occupied Lookout Mountain, west of the town, which\r\nRosecrans had abandoned, and with it his control of the river and the\r\nriver road as far back as Bridgeport.  The National troops were now\r\nstrongly intrenched in Chattanooga Valley, with the Tennessee River\r\nbehind them and the enemy occupying commanding heights to the east and\r\nwest, with a strong line across the valley from mountain to mountain,\r\nand with Chattanooga Creek, for a large part of the way, in front of\r\ntheir line.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th Halleck telegraphed me the above results, and directed all\r\nthe forces that could be spared from my department to be sent to\r\nRosecrans.  Long before this dispatch was received Sherman was on his\r\nway, and McPherson was moving east with most of the garrison of\r\nVicksburg.\r\n\r\nA retreat at that time would have been a terrible disaster.  It would\r\nnot only have been the loss of a most important strategic position to\r\nus, but it would have been attended with the loss of all the artillery\r\nstill left with the Army of the Cumberland and the annihilation of that\r\narmy itself, either by capture or demoralization.\r\n\r\nAll supplies for Rosecrans had to be brought from Nashville. The\r\nrailroad between this base and the army was in possession of the\r\ngovernment up to Bridgeport, the point at which the road crosses to the\r\nsouth side of the Tennessee River; but Bragg, holding Lookout and\r\nRaccoon mountains west of Chattanooga, commanded the railroad, the river\r\nand the shortest and best wagon-roads, both south and north of the\r\nTennessee, between Chattanooga and Bridgeport.  The distance between\r\nthese two places is but twenty-six miles by rail, but owing to the\r\nposition of Bragg, all supplies for Rosecrans had to be hauled by a\r\ncircuitous route north of the river and over a mountainous country,\r\nincreasing the distance to over sixty miles.\r\n\r\nThis country afforded but little food for his animals, nearly ten\r\nthousand of which had already starved, and not enough were left to draw\r\na single piece of artillery or even the ambulances to convey the sick.\r\nThe men had been on half rations of hard bread for a considerable time,\r\nwith but few other supplies except beef driven from Nashville across the\r\ncountry.  The region along the road became so exhausted of food for the\r\ncattle that by the time they reached Chattanooga they were much in the\r\ncondition of the few animals left alive there--\"on the lift.\" Indeed,\r\nthe beef was so poor that the soldiers were in the habit of saying, with\r\na faint facetiousness, that they were living on \"half rations of hard\r\nbread and BEEF DRIED ON THE HOOF.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be transported but food, and the troops were without\r\nsufficient shoes or other clothing suitable for the advancing season.\r\nWhat they had was well worn.  The fuel within the Federal lines was\r\nexhausted, even to the stumps of trees. There were no teams to draw it\r\nfrom the opposite bank, where it was abundant.  The only way of\r\nsupplying fuel, for some time before my arrival, had been to cut trees\r\non the north bank of the river at a considerable distance up the stream,\r\nform rafts of it and float it down with the current, effecting a landing\r\non the south side within our lines by the use of paddles or poles. It\r\nwould then be carried on the shoulders of the men to their camps.\r\n\r\nIf a retreat had occurred at this time it is not probable that any of\r\nthe army would have reached the railroad as an organized body, if\r\nfollowed by the enemy.\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of Mr. Dana's dispatch Mr. Stanton sent for me. Finding\r\nthat I was out he became nervous and excited, inquiring of every person\r\nhe met, including guests of the house, whether they knew where I was,\r\nand bidding them find me and send me to him at once.  About eleven\r\no'clock I returned to the hotel, and on my way, when near the house,\r\nevery person met was a messenger from the Secretary, apparently\r\npartaking of his impatience to see me.  I hastened to the room of the\r\nSecretary and found him pacing the floor rapidly in his dressing-gown.\r\nSaying that the retreat must be prevented, he showed me the dispatch.  I\r\nimmediately wrote an order assuming command of the Military Division of\r\nthe Mississippi, and telegraphed it to General Rosecrans.  I then\r\ntelegraphed to him the order from Washington assigning Thomas to the\r\ncommand of the Army of the Cumberland; and to Thomas that he must hold\r\nChattanooga at all hazards, informing him at the same time that I would\r\nbe at the front as soon as possible.  A prompt reply was received from\r\nThomas, saying, \"We will hold the town till we starve.\"  I appreciated\r\nthe force of this dispatch later when I witnessed the condition of\r\naffairs which prompted it.  It looked, indeed, as if but two courses\r\nwere open:  one to starve, the other to surrender or be captured.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 20th of October I started, with my staff, and\r\nproceeded as far as Nashville.  At that time it was not prudent to\r\ntravel beyond that point by night, so I remained in Nashville until the\r\nnext morning.  Here I met for the first time Andrew Johnson, Military\r\nGovernor of Tennessee.  He delivered a speech of welcome.  His composure\r\nshowed that it was by no means his maiden effort.  It was long, and I\r\nwas in torture while he was delivering it, fearing something would be\r\nexpected from me in response.  I was relieved, however, the people\r\nassembled having apparently heard enough.  At all events they commenced\r\na general hand-shaking, which, although trying where there is so much of\r\nit, was a great relief to me in this emergency.\r\n\r\nFrom Nashville I telegraphed to Burnside, who was then at Knoxville,\r\nthat important points in his department ought to be fortified, so that\r\nthey could be held with the least number of men; to Admiral Porter at\r\nCairo, that Sherman's advance had passed Eastport, Mississippi, that\r\nrations were probably on their way from St. Louis by boat for supplying\r\nhis army, and requesting him to send a gunboat to convoy them; and to\r\nThomas, suggesting that large parties should be put at work on the\r\nwagon-road then in use back to Bridgeport.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 21st we took the train for the front, reaching\r\nStevenson Alabama, after dark.  Rosecrans was there on his way north.\r\nHe came into my car and we held a brief interview, in which he described\r\nvery clearly the situation at Chattanooga, and made some excellent\r\nsuggestions as to what should be done.  My only wonder was that he had\r\nnot carried them out.  We then proceeded to Bridgeport, where we stopped\r\nfor the night.  From here we took horses and made our way by Jasper and\r\nover Waldron's Ridge to Chattanooga. There had been much rain, and the\r\nroads were almost impassable from mud, knee-deep in places, and from\r\nwash-outs on the mountain sides.  I had been on crutches since the time\r\nof my fall in New Orleans, and had to be carried over places where it\r\nwas not safe to cross on horseback.  The roads were strewn with the\r\ndebris of broken wagons and the carcasses of thousands of starved mules\r\nand horses.  At Jasper, some ten or twelve miles from Bridgeport, there\r\nwas a halt.  General O. O. Howard had his headquarters there.  From this\r\npoint I telegraphed Burnside to make every effort to secure five hundred\r\nrounds of ammunition for his artillery and small-arms.  We stopped for\r\nthe night at a little hamlet some ten or twelve miles farther on.  The\r\nnext day we reached Chattanooga a little before dark.  I went directly\r\nto General Thomas's headquarters, and remaining there a few days, until\r\nI could establish my own.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening most of the general officers called in to pay their\r\nrespects and to talk about the condition of affairs.  They pointed out\r\non the map the line, marked with a red or blue pencil, which Rosecrans\r\nhad contemplated falling back upon.  If any of them had approved the\r\nmove they did not say so to me.  I found General W. F. Smith occupying\r\nthe position of chief engineer of the Army of the Cumberland.  I had\r\nknown Smith as a cadet at West Point, but had no recollection of having\r\nmet him after my graduation, in 1843, up to this time.  He explained the\r\nsituation of the two armies and the topography of the country so plainly\r\nthat I could see it without an inspection.  I found that he had\r\nestablished a saw-mill on the banks of the river, by utilizing an old\r\nengine found in the neighborhood; and, by rafting logs from the north\r\nside of the river above, had got out the lumber and completed pontoons\r\nand roadway plank for a second bridge, one flying bridge being there\r\nalready.  He was also rapidly getting out the materials and constructing\r\nthe boats for a third bridge.  In addition to this he had far under way\r\na steamer for plying between Chattanooga and Bridgeport whenever we\r\nmight get possession of the river.  This boat consisted of a scow, made\r\nof the plank sawed out at the mill, housed in, and a stern wheel\r\nattached which was propelled by a second engine taken from some shop or\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\nI telegraphed to Washington this night, notifying General Halleck of my\r\narrival, and asking to have General Sherman assigned to the command of\r\nthe Army of the Tennessee, headquarters in the field.  The request was\r\nat once complied with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nASSUMING THE COMMAND AT CHATTANOOGA--OPENING A LINE OF SUPPLIES--BATTLE\r\nOF WAUHATCHIE--ON THE PICKET LINE.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 24th, I started out to make a personal inspection,\r\ntaking Thomas and Smith with me, besides most of the members of my\r\npersonal staff.  We crossed to the north side of the river, and, moving\r\nto the north of detached spurs of hills, reached the Tennessee at\r\nBrown's Ferry, some three miles below Lookout Mountain, unobserved by\r\nthe enemy.  Here we left our horses back from the river and approached\r\nthe water on foot. There was a picket station of the enemy on the\r\nopposite side, of about twenty men, in full view, and we were within\r\neasy range. They did not fire upon us nor seem to be disturbed by our\r\npresence.  They must have seen that we were all commissioned officers.\r\nBut, I suppose, they looked upon the garrison of Chattanooga as\r\nprisoners of war, feeding or starving themselves, and thought it would\r\nbe inhuman to kill any of them except in self-defence.\r\n\r\nThat night I issued orders for opening the route to Bridgeport--a\r\ncracker line, as the soldiers appropriately termed it.  They had been so\r\nlong on short rations that my first thought was the establishment of a\r\nline over which food might reach them.\r\n\r\nChattanooga is on the south bank of the Tennessee, where that river runs\r\nnearly due west.  It is at the northern end of a valley five or six\r\nmiles in width, through which Chattanooga Creek runs.  To the east of\r\nthe valley is Missionary Ridge, rising from five to eight hundred feet\r\nabove the creek and terminating somewhat abruptly a half mile or more\r\nbefore reaching the Tennessee.  On the west of the valley is Lookout\r\nMountain, twenty-two hundred feet above-tide water.  Just below the town\r\nthe Tennessee makes a turn to the south and runs to the base of Lookout\r\nMountain, leaving no level ground between the mountain and river.  The\r\nMemphis and Charleston Railroad passes this point, where the mountain\r\nstands nearly perpendicular. East of Missionary Ridge flows the South\r\nChickamauga River; west of Lookout Mountain is Lookout Creek; and west\r\nof that, Raccoon Mountains.  Lookout Mountain, at its northern end,\r\nrises almost perpendicularly for some distance, then breaks off in a\r\ngentle slope of cultivated fields to near the summit, where it ends in a\r\npalisade thirty or more feet in height.  On the gently sloping ground,\r\nbetween the upper and lower palisades, there is a single farmhouse,\r\nwhich is reached by a wagon-road from the valley east.\r\n\r\nThe intrenched line of the enemy commenced on the north end of\r\nMissionary Ridge and extended along the crest for some distance south,\r\nthence across Chattanooga valley to Lookout Mountain. Lookout Mountain\r\nwas also fortified and held by the enemy, who also kept troops in\r\nLookout valley west, and on Raccoon Mountain, with pickets extending\r\ndown the river so as to command the road on the north bank and render it\r\nuseless to us.  In addition to this there was an intrenched line in\r\nChattanooga valley extending from the river east of the town to Lookout\r\nMountain, to make the investment complete.  Besides the fortifications\r\non Mission Ridge, there was a line at the base of the hill, with\r\noccasional spurs of rifle-pits half-way up the front.  The enemy's\r\npickets extended out into the valley towards the town, so far that the\r\npickets of the two armies could converse.  At one point they were\r\nseparated only by the narrow creek which gives its name to the valley\r\nand town, and from which both sides drew water.  The Union lines were\r\nshorter than those of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThus the enemy, with a vastly superior force, was strongly fortified to\r\nthe east, south, and west, and commanded the river below.  Practically,\r\nthe Army of the Cumberland was besieged. The enemy had stopped with his\r\ncavalry north of the river the passing of a train loaded with ammunition\r\nand medical supplies.  The Union army was short of both, not having\r\nammunition enough for a day's fighting.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck had, long before my coming into this new field, ordered\r\nparts of the 11th and 12th corps, commanded respectively by Generals\r\nHoward and Slocum, Hooker in command of the whole, from the Army of the\r\nPotomac to reinforce Rosecrans.  It would have been folly to send them\r\nto Chattanooga to help eat up the few rations left there.  They were\r\nconsequently left on the railroad, where supplies could be brought to\r\nthem.  Before my arrival, Thomas ordered their concentration at\r\nBridgeport.\r\n\r\nGeneral W. F. Smith had been so instrumental in preparing for the move\r\nwhich I was now about to make, and so clear in his judgment about the\r\nmanner of making it, that I deemed it but just to him that he should\r\nhave command of the troops detailed to execute the design, although he\r\nwas then acting as a staff officer and was not in command of troops.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of October, after my return to Chattanooga, the following\r\ndetails were made:  General Hooker, who was now at Bridgeport, was\r\nordered to cross to the south side of the Tennessee and march up by\r\nWhitesides and Wauhatchie to Brown's Ferry.  General Palmer, with a\r\ndivision of the 14th corps, Army of the Cumberland, was ordered to move\r\ndown the river on the north side, by a back road, until opposite\r\nWhitesides, then cross and hold the road in Hooker's rear after he had\r\npassed. Four thousand men were at the same time detailed to act under\r\nGeneral Smith directly from Chattanooga. Eighteen hundred of them, under\r\nGeneral Hazen, were to take sixty pontoon boats, and under cover of\r\nnight float by the pickets of the enemy at the north base of Lookout,\r\ndown to Brown's Ferry, then land on the south side and capture or drive\r\naway the pickets at that point.  Smith was to march with the remainder\r\nof the detail, also under cover of night, by the north bank of the river\r\nto Brown's Ferry, taking with him all the material for laying the bridge\r\nas soon as the crossing was secured.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, Hooker crossed the river at Bridgeport and commenced his\r\neastward march.  At three o'clock on the morning of the 27th, Hazen\r\nmoved into the stream with his sixty pontoons and eighteen hundred brave\r\nand well-equipped men.  Smith started enough in advance to be near the\r\nriver when Hazen should arrive.  There are a number of detached spurs of\r\nhills north of the river at Chattanooga, back of which is a good road\r\nparallel to the stream, sheltered from the view from the top of Lookout.\r\nIt was over this road Smith marched.  At five o'clock Hazen landed at\r\nBrown's Ferry, surprised the picket guard, and captured most of it.  By\r\nseven o'clock the whole of Smith's force was ferried over and in\r\npossession of a height commanding the ferry.  This was speedily\r\nfortified, while a detail was laying the pontoon bridge.  By ten o'clock\r\nthe bridge was laid, and our extreme right, now in Lookout valley, was\r\nfortified and connected with the rest of the army.  The two bridges over\r\nthe Tennessee River--a flying one at Chattanooga and the new one at\r\nBrown's Ferry--with the road north of the river, covered from both the\r\nfire and the view of the enemy, made the connection complete.  Hooker\r\nfound but slight obstacles in his way, and on the afternoon of the 28th\r\nemerged into Lookout valley at Wauhatchie.  Howard marched on to Brown's\r\nFerry, while Geary, who commanded a division in the 12th corps, stopped\r\nthree miles south.  The pickets of the enemy on the river below were now\r\ncut off, and soon came in and surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe river was now opened to us from Lookout valley to Bridgeport.\r\nBetween Brown's Ferry and Kelly's Ferry the Tennessee runs through a\r\nnarrow gorge in the mountains, which contracts the stream so much as to\r\nincrease the current beyond the capacity of an ordinary steamer to stem\r\nit.  To get up these rapids, steamers must be cordelled; that is, pulled\r\nup by ropes from the shore.  But there is no difficulty in navigating\r\nthe stream from Bridgeport to Kelly's Ferry.  The latter point is only\r\neight miles from Chattanooga and connected with it by a good wagon-road,\r\nwhich runs through a low pass in the Raccoon Mountains on the south side\r\nof the river to Brown's Ferry, thence on the north side to the river\r\nopposite Chattanooga. There were several steamers at Bridgeport, and\r\nabundance of forage, clothing and provisions.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Chattanooga I had telegraphed back to Nashville for a good\r\nsupply of vegetables and small rations, which the troops had been so\r\nlong deprived of.  Hooker had brought with him from the east a full\r\nsupply of land transportation.  His animals had not been subjected to\r\nhard work on bad roads without forage, but were in good condition.  In\r\nfive days from my arrival in Chattanooga the way was open to Bridgeport\r\nand, with the aid of steamers and Hooker's teams, in a week the troops\r\nwere receiving full rations.  It is hard for any one not an eye-witness\r\nto realize the relief this brought.  The men were soon reclothed and\r\nalso well fed, an abundance of ammunition was brought up, and a\r\ncheerfulness prevailed not before enjoyed in many weeks.  Neither\r\nofficers nor men looked upon themselves any longer as doomed.  The weak\r\nand languid appearance of the troops, so visible before, disappeared at\r\nonce.  I do not know what the effect was on the other side, but assume\r\nit must have been correspondingly depressing.  Mr. Davis had visited\r\nBragg but a short time before, and must have perceived our condition to\r\nbe about as Bragg described it in his subsequent report.  \"These\r\ndispositions,\" he said, \"faithfully sustained, insured the enemy's\r\nspeedy evacuation of Chattanooga for want of food and forage.  Possessed\r\nof the shortest route to his depot, and the one by which reinforcements\r\nmust reach him, we held him at our mercy, and his destruction was only a\r\nquestion of time.\"  But the dispositions were not \"faithfully\r\nsustained,\" and I doubt not but thousands of men engaged in trying to\r\n\"sustain\" them now rejoice that they were not.  There was no time during\r\nthe rebellion when I did not think, and often say, that the South was\r\nmore to be benefited by its defeat than the North.  The latter had the\r\npeople, the institutions, and the territory to make a great and\r\nprosperous nation.  The former was burdened with an institution\r\nabhorrent to all civilized people not brought up under it, and one which\r\ndegraded labor, kept it in ignorance, and enervated the governing class.\r\nWith the outside world at war with this institution, they could not have\r\nextended their territory.  The labor of the country was not skilled, nor\r\nallowed to become so.  The whites could not toil without becoming\r\ndegraded, and those who did were denominated \"poor white trash.\"  The\r\nsystem of labor would have soon exhausted the soil and left the people\r\npoor.  The non-slaveholders would have left the country, and the small\r\nslaveholder must have sold out to his more fortunate neighbor.  Soon the\r\nslaves would have outnumbered the masters, and, not being in sympathy\r\nwith them, would have risen in their might and exterminated them.  The\r\nwar was expensive to the South as well as to the North, both in blood\r\nand treasure, but it was worth all it cost.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was surprised by the movements which secured to us a line of\r\nsupplies.  He appreciated its importance, and hastened to try to recover\r\nthe line from us.  His strength on Lookout Mountain was not equal to\r\nHooker's command in the valley below.  From Missionary Ridge he had to\r\nmarch twice the distance we had from Chattanooga, in order to reach\r\nLookout Valley; but on the night of the 28th and 29th an attack was made\r\non Geary at Wauhatchie by Longstreet's corps.  When the battle\r\ncommenced, Hooker ordered Howard up from Brown's Ferry.  He had three\r\nmiles to march to reach Geary.  On his way he was fired upon by rebel\r\ntroops from a foot-hill to the left of the road and from which the road\r\nwas commanded.  Howard turned to the left, charged up the hill and\r\ncaptured it before the enemy had time to intrench, taking many\r\nprisoners.  Leaving sufficient men to hold this height, he pushed on to\r\nreinforce Geary.  Before he got up, Geary had been engaged for about\r\nthree hours against a vastly superior force.  The night was so dark that\r\nthe men could not distinguish one from another except by the light of\r\nthe flashes of their muskets.  In the darkness and uproar Hooker's\r\nteamsters became frightened and deserted their teams.  The mules also\r\nbecame frightened, and breaking loose from their fastenings stampeded\r\ndirectly towards the enemy.  The latter, no doubt, took this for a\r\ncharge, and stampeded in turn.  By four o'clock in the morning the\r\nbattle had entirely ceased, and our \"cracker line\" was never afterward\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nIn securing possession of Lookout Valley, Smith lost one man killed and\r\nfour or five wounded.  The enemy lost most of his pickets at the ferry,\r\ncaptured.  In the night engagement of the 28th-9th Hooker lost 416\r\nkilled and wounded.  I never knew the loss of the enemy, but our troops\r\nburied over one hundred and fifty of his dead and captured more than a\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nAfter we had secured the opening of a line over which to bring our\r\nsupplies to the army, I made a personal inspection to see the situation\r\nof the pickets of the two armies.  As I have stated, Chattanooga Creek\r\ncomes down the centre of the valley to within a mile or such a matter of\r\nthe town of Chattanooga, then bears off westerly, then north-westerly,\r\nand enters the Tennessee River at the foot of Lookout Mountain.  This\r\ncreek, from its mouth up to where it bears off west, lay between the two\r\nlines of pickets, and the guards of both armies drew their water from\r\nthe same stream.  As I would be under short-range fire and in an open\r\ncountry, I took nobody with me, except, I believe, a bugler, who stayed\r\nsome distance to the rear.  I rode from our right around to our left.\r\nWhen I came to the camp of the picket guard of our side, I heard the\r\ncall, \"Turn out the guard for the commanding general.\"  I replied,\r\n\"Never mind the guard,\" and they were dismissed and went back to their\r\ntents. Just back of these, and about equally distant from the creek,\r\nwere the guards of the Confederate pickets.  The sentinel on their post\r\ncalled out in like manner, \"Turn out the guard for the commanding\r\ngeneral,\" and, I believe, added, \"General Grant.\"  Their line in a\r\nmoment front-faced to the north, facing me, and gave a salute, which I\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nThe most friendly relations seemed to exist between the pickets of the\r\ntwo armies.  At one place there was a tree which had fallen across the\r\nstream, and which was used by the soldiers of both armies in drawing\r\nwater for their camps.  General Longstreet's corps was stationed there\r\nat the time, and wore blue of a little different shade from our uniform.\r\nSeeing a soldier in blue on this log, I rode up to him, commenced\r\nconversing with him, and asked whose corps he belonged to.  He was very\r\npolite, and, touching his hat to me, said he belonged to General\r\nLongstreet's corps.  I asked him a few questions--but not with a view of\r\ngaining any particular information--all of which he answered, and I rode\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF THE ARMY--REBUILDING THE RAILROAD--GENERAL BURNSIDE'S\r\nSITUATION--ORDERS FOR BATTLE--PLANS FOR THE ATTACK--HOOKER'S POSITION\r\n--SHERMAN'S MOVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nHaving got the Army of the Cumberland in a comfortable position, I now\r\nbegan to look after the remainder of my new command. Burnside was in\r\nabout as desperate a condition as the Army of the Cumberland had been,\r\nonly he was not yet besieged.  He was a hundred miles from the nearest\r\npossible base, Big South Fork of the Cumberland River, and much farther\r\nfrom any railroad we had possession of.  The roads back were over\r\nmountains, and all supplies along the line had long since been\r\nexhausted.  His animals, too, had been starved, and their carcasses\r\nlined the road from Cumberland Gap, and far back towards Lexington, Ky.\r\nEast Tennessee still furnished supplies of beef, bread and forage, but\r\nit did not supply ammunition, clothing, medical supplies, or small\r\nrations, such as coffee, sugar, salt and rice.\r\n\r\nSherman had started from Memphis for Corinth on the 11th of October.\r\nHis instructions required him to repair the road in his rear in order to\r\nbring up supplies.  The distance was about three hundred and thirty\r\nmiles through a hostile country.  His entire command could not have\r\nmaintained the road if it had been completed.  The bridges had all been\r\ndestroyed by the enemy, and much other damage done.  A hostile community\r\nlived along the road; guerilla bands infested the country, and more or\r\nless of the cavalry of the enemy was still in the West.  Often Sherman's\r\nwork was destroyed as soon as completed, and he only a short distance\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe Memphis and Charleston Railroad strikes the Tennessee River at\r\nEastport, Mississippi.  Knowing the difficulty Sherman would have to\r\nsupply himself from Memphis, I had previously ordered supplies sent from\r\nSt. Louis on small steamers, to be convoyed by the navy, to meet him at\r\nEastport.  These he got.  I now ordered him to discontinue his work of\r\nrepairing roads and to move on with his whole force to Stevenson,\r\nAlabama, without delay.  This order was borne to Sherman by a messenger,\r\nwho paddled down the Tennessee in a canoe and floated over Muscle\r\nShoals; it was delivered at Iuka on the 27th.  In this Sherman was\r\nnotified that the rebels were moving a force towards Cleveland, East\r\nTennessee, and might be going to Nashville, in which event his troops\r\nwere in the best position to beat them there.  Sherman, with his\r\ncharacteristic promptness, abandoned the work he was engaged upon and\r\npushed on at once.  On the 1st of November he crossed the Tennessee at\r\nEastport, and that day was in Florence, Alabama, with the head of\r\ncolumn, while his troops were still crossing at Eastport, with Blair\r\nbringing up the rear.\r\n\r\nSherman's force made an additional army, with cavalry, artillery, and\r\ntrains, all to be supplied by the single track road from Nashville.  All\r\nindications pointed also to the probable necessity of supplying\r\nBurnside's command in East Tennessee, twenty-five thousand more, by the\r\nsame route.  A single track could not do this.  I gave, therefore, an\r\norder to Sherman to halt General G. M. Dodge's command, of about eight\r\nthousand men, at Athens, and subsequently directed the latter to arrange\r\nhis troops along the railroad from Decatur north towards Nashville, and\r\nto rebuild that road.  The road from Nashville to Decatur passes over a\r\nbroken country, cut up with innumerable streams, many of them of\r\nconsiderable width, and with valleys far below the road-bed.  All the\r\nbridges over these had been destroyed, and the rails taken up and\r\ntwisted by the enemy.  All the cars and locomotives not carried off had\r\nbeen destroyed as effectually as they knew how to destroy them.  All\r\nbridges and culverts had been destroyed between Nashville and Decatur,\r\nand thence to Stevenson, where the Memphis and Charleston and the\r\nNashville and Chattanooga roads unite.  The rebuilding of this road\r\nwould give us two roads as far as Stevenson over which to supply the\r\narmy.  From Bridgeport, a short distance farther east, the river\r\nsupplements the road.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dodge, besides being a most capable soldier, was an experienced\r\nrailroad builder.  He had no tools to work with except those of the\r\npioneers--axes, picks, and spades.  With these he was able to intrench\r\nhis men and protect them against surprises by small parties of the\r\nenemy.  As he had no base of supplies until the road could be completed\r\nback to Nashville, the first matter to consider after protecting his men\r\nwas the getting in of food and forage from the surrounding country.  He\r\nhad his men and teams bring in all the grain they could find, or all\r\nthey needed, and all the cattle for beef, and such other food as could\r\nbe found.  Millers were detailed from the ranks to run the mills along\r\nthe line of the army.  When these were not near enough to the troops for\r\nprotection they were taken down and moved up to the line of the road.\r\nBlacksmith shops, with all the iron and steel found in them, were moved\r\nup in like manner.  Blacksmiths were detailed and set to work making the\r\ntools necessary in railroad and bridge building.  Axemen were put to\r\nwork getting out timber for bridges and cutting fuel for locomotives\r\nwhen the road should be completed.  Car-builders were set to work\r\nrepairing the locomotives and cars.  Thus every branch of railroad\r\nbuilding, making tools to work with, and supplying the workmen with\r\nfood, was all going on at once, and without the aid of a mechanic or\r\nlaborer except what the command itself furnished.  But rails and cars\r\nthe men could not make without material, and there was not enough\r\nrolling stock to keep the road we already had worked to its full\r\ncapacity.  There were no rails except those in use.  To supply these\r\ndeficiencies I ordered eight of the ten engines General McPherson had at\r\nVicksburg to be sent to Nashville, and all the cars he had except ten.\r\nI also ordered the troops in West Tennessee to points on the river and\r\non the Memphis and Charleston road, and ordered the cars, locomotives\r\nand rails from all the railroads except the Memphis and Charleston to\r\nNashville.  The military manager of railroads also was directed to\r\nfurnish more rolling stock and, as far as he could, bridge material.\r\nGeneral Dodge had the work assigned him finished within forty days after\r\nreceiving his orders.  The number of bridges to rebuild was one hundred\r\nand eighty-two, many of them over deep and wide chasms; the length of\r\nroad repaired was one hundred and two miles.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's troops, which it was thought were either moving against\r\nBurnside or were going to Nashville, went no farther than Cleveland.\r\nTheir presence there, however, alarmed the authorities at Washington,\r\nand, on account of our helpless condition at Chattanooga, caused me much\r\nuneasiness.  Dispatches were constantly coming, urging me to do\r\nsomething for Burnside's relief; calling attention to the importance of\r\nholding East Tennessee; saying the President was much concerned for the\r\nprotection of the loyal people in that section, etc.  We had not at\r\nChattanooga animals to pull a single piece of artillery, much less a\r\nsupply train.  Reinforcements could not help Burnside, because he had\r\nneither supplies nor ammunition sufficient for them; hardly, indeed,\r\nbread and meat for the men he had.  There was no relief possible for him\r\nexcept by expelling the enemy from Missionary Ridge and about\r\nChattanooga.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of November Longstreet left our front with about fifteen\r\nthousand troops, besides Wheeler's cavalry, five thousand more, to go\r\nagainst Burnside.  The situation seemed desperate, and was more\r\naggravating because nothing could be done until Sherman should get up.\r\nThe authorities at Washington were now more than ever anxious for the\r\nsafety of Burnside's army, and plied me with dispatches faster than\r\never, urging that something should be done for his relief.  On the 7th,\r\nbefore Longstreet could possibly have reached Knoxville, I ordered\r\nThomas peremptorily to attack the enemy's right, so as to force the\r\nreturn of the troops that had gone up the valley.  I directed him to\r\ntake mules, officers' horses, or animals wherever he could get them to\r\nmove the necessary artillery.  But he persisted in the declaration that\r\nhe could not move a single piece of artillery, and could not see how he\r\ncould possibly comply with the order.  Nothing was left to be done but\r\nto answer Washington dispatches as best I could; urge Sherman forward,\r\nalthough he was making every effort to get forward, and encourage\r\nBurnside to hold on, assuring him that in a short time he should be\r\nrelieved.  All of Burnside's dispatches showed the greatest confidence\r\nin his ability to hold his position as long as his ammunition held out.\r\nHe even suggested the propriety of abandoning the territory he held\r\nsouth and west of Knoxville, so as to draw the enemy farther from his\r\nbase and make it more difficult for him to get back to Chattanooga when\r\nthe battle should begin.  Longstreet had a railroad as far as Loudon;\r\nbut from there to Knoxville he had to rely on wagon trains. Burnside's\r\nsuggestion, therefore, was a good one, and it was adopted.  On the 14th\r\nI telegraphed him:\r\n\r\n\"Sherman's advance has reached Bridgeport.  His whole force will be\r\nready to move from there by Tuesday at farthest.  If you can hold\r\nLongstreet in check until he gets up, or by skirmishing and falling back\r\ncan avoid serious loss to yourself and gain time, I will be able to\r\nforce the enemy back from here and place a force between Longstreet and\r\nBragg that must inevitably make the former take to the mountain-passes\r\nby every available road, to get to his supplies.  Sherman would have\r\nbeen here before this but for high water in Elk River driving him some\r\nthirty miles up that river to cross.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again later in the day, indicating my plans for his relief, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Your dispatch and Dana's just received.  Being there, you can tell\r\nbetter how to resist Longstreet's attack than I can direct.  With your\r\nshowing you had better give up Kingston at the last moment and save the\r\nmost productive part of your possessions.  Every arrangement is now made\r\nto throw Sherman's force across the river, just at and below the mouth\r\nof Chickamauga Creek, as soon as it arrives.  Thomas will attack on his\r\nleft at the same time, and together it is expected to carry Missionary\r\nRidge, and from there push a force on to the railroad between Cleveland\r\nand Dalton.  Hooker will at the same time attack, and, if he can, carry\r\nLookout Mountain.  The enemy now seems to be looking for an attack on\r\nhis left flank.  This favors us.  To further confirm this, Sherman's\r\nadvance division will march direct from Whiteside to Trenton.  The\r\nremainder of his force will pass over a new road just made from\r\nWhiteside to Kelly's Ferry, thus being concealed from the enemy, and\r\nleave him to suppose the whole force is going up Lookout Valley.\r\nSherman's advance has only just reached Bridgeport.  The rear will only\r\nreach there on the 16th.  This will bring it to the 19th as the earliest\r\nday for making the combined movement as desired.  Inform me if you think\r\nyou can sustain yourself until this time.  I can hardly conceive of the\r\nenemy breaking through at Kingston and pushing for Kentucky.  If they\r\nshould, however, a new problem would be left for solution.  Thomas has\r\nordered a division of cavalry to the vicinity of Sparta. I will\r\nascertain if they have started, and inform you.  It will be entirely out\r\nof the question to send you ten thousand men, not because they cannot be\r\nspared, but how would they be fed after they got even one day east from\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\nLongstreet, for some reason or other, stopped at Loudon until the 13th.\r\nThat being the terminus of his railroad communications, it is probable\r\nhe was directed to remain there awaiting orders.  He was in a position\r\nthreatening Knoxville, and at the same time where he could be brought\r\nback speedily to Chattanooga. The day after Longstreet left Loudon,\r\nSherman reached Bridgeport in person and proceeded on to see me that\r\nevening, the 14th, and reached Chattanooga the next day.\r\n\r\nMy orders for battle were all prepared in advance of Sherman's arrival\r\n(*15), except the dates, which could not be fixed while troops to be\r\nengaged were so far away.  The possession of Lookout Mountain was of no\r\nspecial advantage to us now.  Hooker was instructed to send Howard's\r\ncorps to the north side of the Tennessee, thence up behind the hills on\r\nthe north side, and to go into camp opposite Chattanooga; with the\r\nremainder of the command, Hooker was, at a time to be afterwards\r\nappointed, to ascend the western slope between the upper and lower\r\npalisades, and so get into Chattanooga valley.\r\n\r\nThe plan of battle was for Sherman to attack the enemy's right flank,\r\nform a line across it, extend our left over South Chickamauga River so\r\nas to threaten or hold the railroad in Bragg's rear, and thus force him\r\neither to weaken his lines elsewhere or lose his connection with his\r\nbase at Chickamauga Station.  Hooker was to perform like service on our\r\nright.  His problem was to get from Lookout Valley to Chattanooga Valley\r\nin the most expeditious way possible; cross the latter valley rapidly to\r\nRossville, south of Bragg's line on Missionary Ridge, form line there\r\nacross the ridge facing north, with his right flank extended to\r\nChickamauga Valley east of the ridge, thus threatening the enemy's rear\r\non that flank and compelling him to reinforce this also.  Thomas, with\r\nthe Army of the Cumberland, occupied the centre, and was to assault\r\nwhile the enemy was engaged with most of his forces on his two flanks.\r\n\r\nTo carry out this plan, Sherman was to cross the Tennessee at Brown's\r\nFerry and move east of Chattanooga to a point opposite the north end of\r\nMission Ridge, and to place his command back of the foot-hills out of\r\nsight of the enemy on the ridge.  There are two streams called\r\nChickamauga emptying into the Tennessee River east of Chattanooga--North\r\nChickamauga, taking its rise in Tennessee, flowing south, and emptying\r\ninto the river some seven or eight miles east; while the South\r\nChickamauga, which takes its rise in Georgia, flows northward, and\r\nempties into the Tennessee some three or four miles above the town.\r\nThere were now one hundred and sixteen pontoons in the North Chickamauga\r\nRiver, their presence there being unknown to the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt night a division was to be marched up to that point, and at two\r\no'clock in the morning moved down with the current, thirty men in each\r\nboat.  A few were to land east of the mouth of the South Chickamauga,\r\ncapture the pickets there, and then lay a bridge connecting the two\r\nbanks of the river.  The rest were to land on the south side of the\r\nTennessee, where Missionary Ridge would strike it if prolonged, and a\r\nsufficient number of men to man the boats were to push to the north side\r\nto ferry over the main body of Sherman's command while those left on the\r\nsouth side intrenched themselves.  Thomas was to move out from his lines\r\nfacing the ridge, leaving enough of Palmer's corps to guard against an\r\nattack down the valley.  Lookout Valley being of no present value to us,\r\nand being untenable by the enemy if we should secure Missionary Ridge,\r\nHooker's orders were changed.  His revised orders brought him to\r\nChattanooga by the established route north of the Tennessee.  He was\r\nthen to move out to the right to Rossville.\r\n\r\nHooker's position in Lookout Valley was absolutely essential to us so\r\nlong as Chattanooga was besieged.  It was the key to our line for\r\nsupplying the army.  But it was not essential after the enemy was\r\ndispersed from our front, or even after the battle for this purpose was\r\nbegun.  Hooker's orders, therefore, were designed to get his force past\r\nLookout Mountain and Chattanooga Valley, and up to Missionary Ridge.  By\r\ncrossing the north face of Lookout the troops would come into\r\nChattanooga Valley in rear of the line held by the enemy across the\r\nvalley, and would necessarily force its evacuation.  Orders were\r\naccordingly given to march by this route.  But days before the battle\r\nbegan the advantages as well as the disadvantages of this plan of action\r\nwere all considered.  The passage over the mountain was a difficult one\r\nto make in the face of an enemy.  It might consume so much time as to\r\nlose us the use of the troops engaged in it at other points where they\r\nwere more wanted.  After reaching Chattanooga Valley, the creek of the\r\nsame name, quite a formidable stream to get an army over, had to be\r\ncrossed.  I was perfectly willing that the enemy should keep Lookout\r\nMountain until we got through with the troops on Missionary Ridge.  By\r\nmarching Hooker to the north side of the river, thence up the stream,\r\nand recrossing at the town, he could be got in position at any named\r\ntime; when in this new position, he would have Chattanooga Creek behind\r\nhim, and the attack on Missionary Ridge would unquestionably cause the\r\nevacuation by the enemy of his line across the valley and on Lookout\r\nMountain.  Hooker's order was changed accordingly.  As explained\r\nelsewhere, the original order had to be reverted to, because of a flood\r\nin the river rendering the bridge at Brown's Ferry unsafe for the\r\npassage of troops at the exact juncture when it was wanted to bring all\r\nthe troops together against Missionary Ridge.\r\n\r\nThe next day after Sherman's arrival I took him, with Generals Thomas\r\nand Smith and other officers, to the north side of the river, and showed\r\nthem the ground over which Sherman had to march, and pointed out\r\ngenerally what he was expected to do.  I, as well as the authorities in\r\nWashington, was still in a great state of anxiety for Burnside's safety.\r\nBurnside himself, I believe, was the only one who did not share in this\r\nanxiety. Nothing could be done for him, however, until Sherman's troops\r\nwere up.  As soon, therefore, as the inspection was over, Sherman\r\nstarted for Bridgeport to hasten matters, rowing a boat himself, I\r\nbelieve, from Kelly's Ferry.  Sherman had left Bridgeport the night\r\nof the 14th, reached Chattanooga the evening of the 15th, made the\r\nabove-described inspection on the morning of the 16th, and started back\r\nthe same evening to hurry up his command, fully appreciating the\r\nimportance of time.\r\n\r\nHis march was conducted with as much expedition as the roads and season\r\nwould admit of.  By the 20th he was himself at Brown's Ferry with the\r\nhead of column, but many of his troops were far behind, and one division\r\n(Ewing's) was at Trenton, sent that way to create the impression that\r\nLookout was to be taken from the south.  Sherman received his orders at\r\nthe ferry, and was asked if he could not be ready for the assault the\r\nfollowing morning.  News had been received that the battle had been\r\ncommenced at Knoxville.  Burnside had been cut off from telegraphic\r\ncommunications.  The President, the Secretary of War, and General\r\nHalleck, were in an agony of suspense.  My suspense was also great, but\r\nmore endurable, because I was where I could soon do something to relieve\r\nthe situation.  It was impossible to get Sherman's troops up for the\r\nnext day.  I then asked him if they could not be got up to make the\r\nassault on the morning of the 22d, and ordered Thomas to move on that\r\ndate.  But the elements were against us.  It rained all the 20th and\r\n21st. The river rose so rapidly that it was difficult to keep the\r\npontoons in place.\r\n\r\nGeneral Orlando B. Willcox, a division commander under Burnside, was at\r\nthis time occupying a position farther up the valley than Knoxville\r\n--about Maynardville--and was still in telegraphic communication with the\r\nNorth.  A dispatch was received from him saying that he was threatened\r\nfrom the east.  The following was sent in reply:\r\n\r\n\"If you can communicate with General Burnside, say to him that our\r\nattack on Bragg will commence in the morning.  If successful, such a\r\nmove will be made as I think will relieve East Tennessee, if he can hold\r\nout.  Longstreet passing through our lines to Kentucky need not cause\r\nalarm.  He would find the country so bare that he would lose his\r\ntransportation and artillery before reaching Kentucky, and would meet\r\nsuch a force before he got through, that he could not return.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, Sherman continued his crossing without intermission as fast as\r\nhis troops could be got up.  The crossing had to be effected in full\r\nview of the enemy on the top of Lookout Mountain.  Once over, however,\r\nthe troops soon disappeared behind the detached hill on the north side,\r\nand would not come to view again, either to watchmen on Lookout Mountain\r\nor Missionary Ridge, until they emerged between the hills to strike the\r\nbank of the river.  But when Sherman's advance reached a point opposite\r\nthe town of Chattanooga, Howard, who, it will be remembered, had been\r\nconcealed behind the hills on the north side, took up his line of march\r\nto join the troops on the south side.  His crossing was in full view\r\nboth from Missionary Ridge and the top of Lookout, and the enemy of\r\ncourse supposed these troops to be Sherman's.  This enabled Sherman to\r\nget to his assigned position without discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR BATTLE--THOMAS CARRIES THE FIRST LINE OF THE ENEMY\r\n--SHERMAN CARRIES MISSIONARY RIDGE--BATTLE OF LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN\r\n--GENERAL HOOKER'S FIGHT.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, when so much was occurring to discourage--rains falling so\r\nheavily as to delay the passage of troops over the river at Brown's\r\nFerry and threatening the entire breaking of the bridge; news coming of\r\na battle raging at Knoxville; of Willcox being threatened by a force\r\nfrom the east--a letter was received from Bragg which contained these\r\nwords:  \"As there may still be some non-combatants in Chattanooga, I\r\ndeem it proper to notify you that prudence would dictate their early\r\nwithdrawal.\" Of course, I understood that this was a device intended to\r\ndeceive; but I did not know what the intended deception was.  On the\r\n22d, however, a deserter came in who informed me that Bragg was leaving\r\nour front, and on that day Buckner's division was sent to reinforce\r\nLongstreet at Knoxville, and another division started to follow but was\r\nrecalled.  The object of Bragg's letter, no doubt, was in some way to\r\ndetain me until Knoxville could be captured, and his troops there be\r\nreturned to Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 21st the rest of the pontoon boats, completed,\r\none hundred and sixteen in all, were carried up to and placed in North\r\nChickamauga. The material for the roadway over these was deposited out\r\nof view of the enemy within a few hundred yards of the bank of the\r\nTennessee, where the north end of the bridge was to rest.\r\n\r\nHearing nothing from Burnside, and hearing much of the distress in\r\nWashington on his account, I could no longer defer operations for his\r\nrelief.  I determined, therefore, to do on the 23d, with the Army of the\r\nCumberland, what had been intended to be done on the 24th.\r\n\r\nThe position occupied by the Army of the Cumberland had been made very\r\nstrong for defence during the months it had been besieged.  The line was\r\nabout a mile from the town, and extended from Citico Creek, a small\r\nstream running near the base of Missionary Ridge and emptying into the\r\nTennessee about two miles below the mouth of the South Chickamauga, on\r\nthe left, to Chattanooga Creek on the right.  All commanding points on\r\nthe line were well fortified and well equipped with artillery.  The\r\nimportant elevations within the line had all been carefully fortified\r\nand supplied with a proper armament.  Among the elevations so fortified\r\nwas one to the east of the town, named Fort Wood.  It owed its\r\nimportance chiefly to the fact that it lay between the town and\r\nMissionary Ridge, where most of the strength of the enemy was.  Fort\r\nWood had in it twenty-two pieces of artillery, most of which would reach\r\nthe nearer points of the enemy's line.  On the morning of the 23d\r\nThomas, according to instructions, moved Granger's corps of two\r\ndivisions, Sheridan and T. J. Wood commanding, to the foot of Fort Wood,\r\nand formed them into line as if going on parade, Sheridan on the right,\r\nWood to the left, extending to or near Citico Creek.  Palmer, commanding\r\nthe 14th corps, held that part of our line facing south and southwest.\r\nHe supported Sheridan with one division (Baird's), while his other\r\ndivision under Johnson remained in the trenches, under arms, ready to be\r\nmoved to any point. Howard's corps was moved in rear of the centre.  The\r\npicket lines were within a few hundred yards of each other.  At two\r\no'clock in the afternoon all were ready to advance.  By this time the\r\nclouds had lifted so that the enemy could see from his elevated position\r\nall that was going on.  The signal for advance was given by a booming of\r\ncannon from Fort Wood and other points on the line.  The rebel pickets\r\nwere soon driven back upon the main guards, which occupied minor and\r\ndetached heights between the main ridge and our lines.  These too were\r\ncarried before halting, and before the enemy had time to reinforce their\r\nadvance guards.  But it was not without loss on both sides. This\r\nmovement secured to us a line fully a mile in advance of the one we\r\noccupied in the morning, and the one which the enemy had occupied up to\r\nthis time.  The fortifications were rapidly turned to face the other\r\nway.  During the following night they were made strong.  We lost in this\r\npreliminary action about eleven hundred killed and wounded, while the\r\nenemy probably lost quite as heavily, including the prisoners that were\r\ncaptured. With the exception of the firing of artillery, kept up from\r\nMissionary Ridge and Fort Wood until night closed in, this ended the\r\nfighting for the first day.\r\n\r\nThe advantage was greatly on our side now, and if I could only have been\r\nassured that Burnside could hold out ten days longer I should have\r\nrested more easily.  But we were doing the best we could for him and the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nBy the night of the 23d Sherman's command was in a position to move,\r\nthough one division (Osterhaus's) had not yet crossed the river at\r\nBrown's Ferry.  The continuous rise in the Tennessee had rendered it\r\nimpossible to keep the bridge at that point in condition for troops to\r\ncross; but I was determined to move that night even without this\r\ndivision.  Orders were sent to Osterhaus accordingly to report to\r\nHooker, if he could not cross by eight o'clock on the morning of the\r\n24th.  Because of the break in the bridge, Hooker's orders were again\r\nchanged, but this time only back to those first given to him.\r\n\r\nGeneral W. F. Smith had been assigned to duty as Chief Engineer of the\r\nMilitary Division.  To him were given the general direction of moving\r\ntroops by the boats from North Chickamauga, laying the bridge after they\r\nreached their position, and generally all the duties pertaining to his\r\noffice of chief engineer.  During the night General Morgan L. Smith's\r\ndivision was marched to the point where the pontoons were, and the\r\nbrigade of Giles A. Smith was selected for the delicate duty of manning\r\nthe boats and surprising the enemy's pickets on the south bank of the\r\nriver.  During this night also General J. M. Brannan, chief of\r\nartillery, moved forty pieces of artillery, belonging to the Army of the\r\nCumberland, and placed them on the north side of the river so as to\r\ncommand the ground opposite, to aid in protecting the approach to the\r\npoint where the south end of the bridge was to rest.  He had to use\r\nSherman's artillery horses for this purpose, Thomas having none.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock in the morning, November 24th, Giles A. Smith pushed out\r\nfrom the North Chickamauga with his one hundred and sixteen boats, each\r\nloaded with thirty brave and well-armed men.  The boats with their\r\nprecious freight dropped down quietly with the current to avoid\r\nattracting the attention of any one who could convey information to the\r\nenemy, until arriving near the mouth of South Chickamauga. Here a few\r\nboats were landed, the troops debarked, and a rush was made upon the\r\npicket guard known to be at that point.  The guard were surprised, and\r\ntwenty of their number captured.  The remainder of the troops effected a\r\nlanding at the point where the bridge was to start, with equally good\r\nresults.  The work of ferrying over Sherman's command from the north\r\nside of the Tennessee was at once commenced, using the pontoons for the\r\npurpose.  A steamer was also brought up from the town to assist.  The\r\nrest of M. L. Smith's division came first, then the division of John E.\r\nSmith.  The troops as they landed were put to work intrenching their\r\nposition.  By daylight the two entire divisions were over, and well\r\ncovered by the works they had built.\r\n\r\nThe work of laying the bridge, on which to cross the artillery and\r\ncavalry, was now begun.  The ferrying over the infantry was continued\r\nwith the steamer and the pontoons, taking the pontoons, however, as fast\r\nas they were wanted to put in their place in the bridge.  By a little\r\npast noon the bridge was completed, as well as one over the South\r\nChickamauga connecting the troops left on that side with their comrades\r\nbelow, and all the infantry and artillery were on the south bank of the\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nSherman at once formed his troops for assault on Missionary Ridge.  By\r\none o'clock he started with M. L. Smith on his left, keeping nearly the\r\ncourse of Chickamauga River; J. E. Smith next to the right and a little\r\nto the rear; and Ewing still farther to the right and also a little to\r\nthe rear of J. E. Smith's command, in column, ready to deploy to the\r\nright if an enemy should come from that direction.  A good skirmish line\r\npreceded each of these columns.  Soon the foot of the hill was reached;\r\nthe skirmishers pushed directly up, followed closely by their supports.\r\nBy half-past three Sherman was in possession of the height without\r\nhaving sustained much loss.  A brigade from each division was now\r\nbrought up, and artillery was dragged to the top of the hill by hand.\r\nThe enemy did not seem to be aware of this movement until the top of the\r\nhill was gained.  There had been a drizzling rain during the day, and\r\nthe clouds were so low that Lookout Mountain and the top of Missionary\r\nRidge were obscured from the view of persons in the valley.  But now the\r\nenemy opened fire upon their assailants, and made several attempts with\r\ntheir skirmishers to drive them away, but without avail.  Later in the\r\nday a more determined attack was made, but this, too, failed, and\r\nSherman was left to fortify what he had gained.\r\n\r\nSherman's cavalry took up its line of march soon after the bridge was\r\ncompleted, and by half-past three the whole of it was over both bridges\r\nand on its way to strike the enemy's communications at Chickamauga\r\nStation.  All of Sherman's command was now south of the Tennessee.\r\nDuring the afternoon General Giles A. Smith was severely wounded and\r\ncarried from the field.\r\n\r\nThomas having done on the 23d what was expected of him on the 24th,\r\nthere was nothing for him to do this day except to strengthen his\r\nposition.  Howard, however, effected a crossing of Citico Creek and a\r\njunction with Sherman, and was directed to report to him.  With two or\r\nthree regiments of his command he moved in the morning along the banks\r\nof the Tennessee, and reached the point where the bridge was being laid.\r\nHe went out on the bridge as far as it was completed from the south end,\r\nand saw Sherman superintending the work from the north side and moving\r\nhimself south as fast as an additional boat was put in and the roadway\r\nput upon it.  Howard reported to his new chief across the chasm between\r\nthem, which was now narrow and in a few minutes closed.\r\n\r\nWhile these operations were going on to the east of Chattanooga, Hooker\r\nwas engaged on the west.  He had three divisions: Osterhaus's, of the\r\n15th corps, Army of the Tennessee; Geary's, 12th corps, Army of the\r\nPotomac; and Cruft's, 14th corps, Army of the Cumberland.  Geary was on\r\nthe right at Wauhatchie, Cruft at the centre, and Osterhaus near Brown's\r\nFerry.  These troops were all west of Lookout Creek.  The enemy had the\r\neast bank of the creek strongly picketed and intrenched, and three\r\nbrigades of troops in the rear to reinforce them if attacked.  These\r\nbrigades occupied the summit of the mountain.  General Carter L.\r\nStevenson was in command of the whole.  Why any troops, except artillery\r\nwith a small infantry guard, were kept on the mountain-top, I do not\r\nsee.  A hundred men could have held the summit--which is a palisade for\r\nmore than thirty feet down--against the assault of any number of men\r\nfrom the position Hooker occupied.\r\n\r\nThe side of Lookout Mountain confronting Hooker's command was rugged,\r\nheavily timbered, and full of chasms, making it difficult to advance\r\nwith troops, even in the absence of an opposing force.  Farther up, the\r\nground becomes more even and level, and was in cultivation.  On the east\r\nside the slope is much more gradual, and a good wagon road, zigzagging\r\nup it, connects the town of Chattanooga with the summit.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 24th Hooker moved Geary's division,\r\nsupported by a brigade of Cruft's, up Lookout Creek, to effect a\r\ncrossing.  The remainder of Cruft's division was to seize the bridge\r\nover the creek, near the crossing of the railroad. Osterhaus was to move\r\nup to the bridge and cross it.  The bridge was seized by Gross's brigade\r\nafter a slight skirmish with the pickets guarding it.  This attracted\r\nthe enemy so that Geary's movement farther up was not observed.  A heavy\r\nmist obscured him from the view of the troops on the top of the\r\nmountain.  He crossed the creek almost unobserved, and captured the\r\npicket of over forty men on guard near by.  He then commenced ascending\r\nthe mountain directly in his front.  By this time the enemy was seen\r\ncoming down from their camps on the mountain slope, and filing into\r\ntheir rifle-pits to contest the crossing of the bridge.  By eleven\r\no'clock the bridge was complete.  Osterhaus was up, and after some sharp\r\nskirmishing the enemy was driven away with considerable loss in killed\r\nand captured.\r\n\r\nWhile the operations at the bridge were progressing, Geary was pushing\r\nup the hill over great obstacles, resisted by the enemy directly in his\r\nfront, and in face of the guns on top of the mountain.  The enemy,\r\nseeing their left flank and rear menaced, gave way, and were followed by\r\nCruft and Osterhaus.  Soon these were up abreast of Geary, and the whole\r\ncommand pushed up the hill, driving the enemy in advance.  By noon Geary\r\nhad gained the open ground on the north slope of the mountain, with his\r\nright close up to the base of the upper palisade, but there were strong\r\nfortifications in his front.  The rest of the command coming up, a line\r\nwas formed from the base of the upper palisade to the mouth of\r\nChattanooga Creek.\r\n\r\nThomas and I were on the top of Orchard Knob.  Hooker's advance now made\r\nour line a continuous one.  It was in full view, extending from the\r\nTennessee River, where Sherman had crossed, up Chickamauga River to the\r\nbase of Mission Ridge, over the top of the north end of the ridge to\r\nChattanooga Valley, then along parallel to the ridge a mile or more,\r\nacross the valley to the mouth of Chattanooga Creek, thence up the slope\r\nof Lookout Mountain to the foot of the upper palisade.  The day was\r\nhazy, so that Hooker's operations were not visible to us except at\r\nmoments when the clouds would rise.  But the sound of his artillery and\r\nmusketry was heard incessantly.  The enemy on his front was partially\r\nfortified, but was soon driven out of his works.  During the afternoon\r\nthe clouds, which had so obscured the top of Lookout all day as to hide\r\nwhatever was going on from the view of those below, settled down and\r\nmade it so dark where Hooker was as to stop operations for the time.  At\r\nfour o'clock Hooker reported his position as impregnable.  By a little\r\nafter five direct communication was established, and a brigade of troops\r\nwas sent from Chattanooga to reinforce him.  These troops had to cross\r\nChattanooga Creek and met with some opposition, but soon overcame it,\r\nand by night the commander, General Carlin, reported to Hooker and was\r\nassigned to his left.  I now telegraphed to Washington:  \"The fight\r\nto-day progressed favorably.  Sherman carried the end of Missionary\r\nRidge, and his right is now at the tunnel, and his left at Chickamauga\r\nCreek. Troops from Lookout Valley carried the point of the mountain, and\r\nnow hold the eastern slope and a point high up.  Hooker reports two\r\nthousand prisoners taken, besides which a small number have fallen into\r\nour hands from Missionary Ridge.\"  The next day the President replied:\r\n\"Your dispatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here.  Well\r\ndone. Many thanks to all.  Remember Burnside.\"  And Halleck also\r\ntelegraphed: \"I congratulate you on the success thus far of your plans.\r\nI fear that Burnside is hard pushed, and that any further delay may\r\nprove fatal.  I know you will do all in your power to relieve him.\"\r\n\r\nThe division of Jefferson C. Davis, Army of the Cumberland, had been\r\nsent to the North Chickamauga to guard the pontoons as they were\r\ndeposited in the river, and to prevent all ingress or egress of\r\ncitizens.  On the night of the 24th his division, having crossed with\r\nSherman, occupied our extreme left from the upper bridge over the plain\r\nto the north base of Missionary Ridge. Firing continued to a late hour\r\nin the night, but it was not connected with an assault at any point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF CHATTANOOGA--A GALLANT CHARGE--COMPLETE ROUT OF THE ENEMY\r\n--PURSUIT OF THE CONFEDERATES--GENERAL BRAGG--REMARKS ON CHATTANOOGA.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock at night, when all was quiet, I began to give orders\r\nfor the next day, and sent a dispatch to Willcox to encourage Burnside.\r\nSherman was directed to attack at daylight.  Hooker was ordered to move\r\nat the same hour, and endeavor to intercept the enemy's retreat if he\r\nstill remained; if he had gone, then to move directly to Rossville and\r\noperate against the left and rear of the force on Missionary Ridge.\r\nThomas was not to move until Hooker had reached Missionary Ridge.  As I\r\nwas with him on Orchard Knob, he would not move without further orders\r\nfrom me.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 25th opened clear and bright, and the whole field was\r\nin full view from the top of Orchard Knob.  It remained so all day.\r\nBragg's headquarters were in full view, and officers--presumably staff\r\nofficers--could be seen coming and going constantly.\r\n\r\nThe point of ground which Sherman had carried on the 24th was almost\r\ndisconnected from the main ridge occupied by the enemy. A low pass, over\r\nwhich there is a wagon road crossing the hill, and near which there is a\r\nrailroad tunnel, intervenes between the two hills.  The problem now was\r\nto get to the main ridge. The enemy was fortified on the point; and back\r\nfarther, where the ground was still higher, was a second fortification\r\ncommanding the first.  Sherman was out as soon as it was light enough to\r\nsee, and by sunrise his command was in motion.  Three brigades held the\r\nhill already gained.  Morgan L. Smith moved along the east base of\r\nMissionary Ridge; Loomis along the west base, supported by two brigades\r\nof John E. Smith's division; and Corse with his brigade was between the\r\ntwo, moving directly towards the hill to be captured.  The ridge is\r\nsteep and heavily wooded on the east side, where M. L. Smith's troops\r\nwere advancing, but cleared and with a more gentle slope on the west\r\nside.  The troops advanced rapidly and carried the extreme end of the\r\nrebel works.  Morgan L. Smith advanced to a point which cut the enemy\r\noff from the railroad bridge and the means of bringing up supplies by\r\nrail from Chickamauga Station, where the main depot was located.  The\r\nenemy made brave and strenuous efforts to drive our troops from the\r\nposition we had gained, but without success.  The contest lasted for two\r\nhours.  Corse, a brave and efficient commander, was badly wounded in\r\nthis assault.  Sherman now threatened both Bragg's flank and his stores,\r\nand made it necessary for him to weaken other points of his line to\r\nstrengthen his right.  From the position I occupied I could see column\r\nafter column of Bragg's forces moving against Sherman.  Every\r\nConfederate gun that could be brought to bear upon the Union forces was\r\nconcentrated upon him.  J. E. Smith, with two brigades, charged up the\r\nwest side of the ridge to the support of Corse's command, over open\r\nground and in the face of a heavy fire of both artillery and musketry,\r\nand reached the very parapet of the enemy.  He lay here for a time, but\r\nthe enemy coming with a heavy force upon his right flank, he was\r\ncompelled to fall back, followed by the foe.  A few hundred yards\r\nbrought Smith's troops into a wood, where they were speedily reformed,\r\nwhen they charged and drove the attacking party back to his\r\nintrenchments.\r\n\r\nSeeing the advance, repulse, and second advance of J. E. Smith from the\r\nposition I occupied, I directed Thomas to send a division to reinforce\r\nhim.  Baird's division was accordingly sent from the right of Orchard\r\nKnob.  It had to march a considerable distance directly under the eye of\r\nthe enemy to reach its position.  Bragg at once commenced massing in the\r\nsame direction.  This was what I wanted.  But it had now got to be late\r\nin the afternoon, and I had expected before this to see Hooker crossing\r\nthe ridge in the neighborhood of Rossville and compelling Bragg to mass\r\nin that direction also.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had evacuated Lookout Mountain during the night, as I expected\r\nhe would.  In crossing the valley he burned the bridge over Chattanooga\r\nCreek, and did all he could to obstruct the roads behind him.  Hooker\r\nwas off bright and early, with no obstructions in his front but distance\r\nand the destruction above named.  He was detained four hours crossing\r\nChattanooga Creek, and thus was lost the immediate advantage I expected\r\nfrom his forces.  His reaching Bragg's flank and extending across it was\r\nto be the signal for Thomas's assault of the ridge.  But Sherman's\r\ncondition was getting so critical that the assault for his relief could\r\nnot be delayed any longer.\r\n\r\nSheridan's and Wood's divisions had been lying under arms from early\r\nmorning, ready to move the instant the signal was given. I now directed\r\nThomas to order the charge at once (*16). I watched eagerly to see the\r\neffect, and became impatient at last that there was no indication of any\r\ncharge being made.  The centre of the line which was to make the charge\r\nwas near where Thomas and I stood, but concealed from view by an\r\nintervening forest.  Turning to Thomas to inquire what caused the delay,\r\nI was surprised to see Thomas J. Wood, one of the division commanders\r\nwho was to make the charge, standing talking to him.  I spoke to General\r\nWood, asking him why he did not charge as ordered an hour before.  He\r\nreplied very promptly that this was the first he had heard of it, but\r\nthat he had been ready all day to move at a moment's notice.  I told him\r\nto make the charge at once.  He was off in a moment, and in an\r\nincredibly short time loud cheering was heard, and he and Sheridan were\r\ndriving the enemy's advance before them towards Missionary Ridge.  The\r\nConfederates were strongly intrenched on the crest of the ridge in front\r\nof us, and had a second line half-way down and another at the base. Our\r\nmen drove the troops in front of the lower line of rifle-pits so\r\nrapidly, and followed them so closely, that rebel and Union troops went\r\nover the first line of works almost at the same time.  Many rebels were\r\ncaptured and sent to the rear under the fire of their own friends higher\r\nup the hill.  Those that were not captured retreated, and were pursued.\r\nThe retreating hordes being between friends and pursuers caused the\r\nenemy to fire high to avoid killing their own men.  In fact, on that\r\noccasion the Union soldier nearest the enemy was in the safest position.\r\nWithout awaiting further orders or stopping to reform, on our troops\r\nwent to the second line of works; over that and on for the crest--thus\r\neffectually carrying out my orders of the 18th for the battle and of the\r\n24th (*17) for this charge.\r\n\r\nI watched their progress with intense interest.  The fire along the\r\nrebel line was terrific.  Cannon and musket balls filled the air:  but\r\nthe damage done was in small proportion to the ammunition expended.  The\r\npursuit continued until the crest was reached, and soon our men were\r\nseen climbing over the Confederate barriers at different points in front\r\nof both Sheridan's and Wood's divisions.  The retreat of the enemy along\r\nmost of his line was precipitate and the panic so great that Bragg and\r\nhis officers lost all control over their men.  Many were captured, and\r\nthousands threw away their arms in their flight.\r\n\r\nSheridan pushed forward until he reached the Chickamauga River at a\r\npoint above where the enemy crossed.  He met some resistance from troops\r\noccupying a second hill in rear of Missionary Ridge, probably to cover\r\nthe retreat of the main body and of the artillery and trains.  It was\r\nnow getting dark, but Sheridan, without halting on that account pushed\r\nhis men forward up this second hill slowly and without attracting the\r\nattention of the men placed to defend it, while he detached to the right\r\nand left to surround the position.  The enemy discovered the movement\r\nbefore these dispositions were complete, and beat a hasty retreat,\r\nleaving artillery, wagon trains, and many prisoners in our hands.  To\r\nSheridan's prompt movement the Army of the Cumberland, and the nation,\r\nare indebted for the bulk of the capture of prisoners, artillery, and\r\nsmall-arms that day. Except for his prompt pursuit, so much in this way\r\nwould not have been accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhile the advance up Mission Ridge was going forward, General Thomas\r\nwith staff, General Gordon Granger, commander of the corps making the\r\nassault, and myself and staff occupied Orchard Knob, from which the\r\nentire field could be observed.  The moment the troops were seen going\r\nover the last line of rebel defences, I ordered Granger to join his\r\ncommand, and mounting my horse I rode to the front.  General Thomas left\r\nabout the same time. Sheridan on the extreme right was already in\r\npursuit of the enemy east of the ridge.  Wood, who commanded the\r\ndivision to the left of Sheridan, accompanied his men on horseback in\r\nthe charge, but did not join Sheridan in the pursuit.  To the left, in\r\nBaird's front where Bragg's troops had massed against Sherman, the\r\nresistance was more stubborn and the contest lasted longer.  I ordered\r\nGranger to follow the enemy with Wood's division, but he was so much\r\nexcited, and kept up such a roar of musketry in the direction the enemy\r\nhad taken, that by the time I could stop the firing the enemy had got\r\nwell out of the way.  The enemy confronting Sherman, now seeing\r\neverything to their left giving way, fled also.  Sherman, however, was\r\nnot aware of the extent of our success until after nightfall, when he\r\nreceived orders to pursue at daylight in the morning.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Sherman discovered that the enemy had left his front he\r\ndirected his reserves, Davis's division of the Army of the Cumberland,\r\nto push over the pontoon-bridge at the mouth of the Chickamauga, and to\r\nmove forward to Chickamauga Station.  He ordered Howard to move up the\r\nstream some two miles to where there was an old bridge, repair it during\r\nthe night, and follow Davis at four o'clock in the morning.  Morgan L.\r\nSmith was ordered to reconnoitre the tunnel to see if that was still\r\nheld.  Nothing was found there but dead bodies of men of both armies.\r\nThe rest of Sherman's command was directed to follow Howard at daylight\r\nin the morning to get on to the railroad towards Graysville.\r\n\r\nHooker, as stated, was detained at Chattanooga Creek by the destruction\r\nof the bridge at that point.  He got his troops over, with the exception\r\nof the artillery, by fording the stream at a little after three o'clock.\r\nLeaving his artillery to follow when the bridge should be reconstructed,\r\nhe pushed on with the remainder of his command.  At Rossville he came\r\nupon the flank of a division of the enemy, which soon commenced a\r\nretreat along the ridge.  This threw them on Palmer.  They could make\r\nbut little resistance in the position they were caught in, and as many\r\nof them as could do so escaped.  Many, however, were captured.  Hooker's\r\nposition during the night of the 25th was near Rossville, extending east\r\nof the ridge.  Palmer was on his left, on the road to Graysville.\r\n\r\nDuring the night I telegraphed to Willcox that Bragg had been defeated,\r\nand that immediate relief would be sent to Burnside if he could hold\r\nout; to Halleck I sent an announcement of our victory, and informed him\r\nthat forces would be sent up the valley to relieve Burnside.\r\n\r\nBefore the battle of Chattanooga opened I had taken measures for the\r\nrelief of Burnside the moment the way should be clear. Thomas was\r\ndirected to have the little steamer that had been built at Chattanooga\r\nloaded to its capacity with rations and ammunition.  Granger's corps was\r\nto move by the south bank of the Tennessee River to the mouth of the\r\nHolston, and up that to Knoxville accompanied by the boat.  In addition\r\nto the supplies transported by boat, the men were to carry forty rounds\r\nof ammunition in their cartridge-boxes, and four days' rations in\r\nhaversacks.\r\n\r\nIn the battle of Chattanooga, troops from the Army of the Potomac, from\r\nthe Army of the Tennessee, and from the Army of the Cumberland\r\nparticipated.  In fact, the accidents growing out of the heavy rains and\r\nthe sudden rise in the Tennessee River so mingled the troops that the\r\norganizations were not kept together, under their respective commanders,\r\nduring the battle.  Hooker, on the right, had Geary's division of the\r\n12th corps, Army of the Potomac; Osterhaus's division of the 15th corps,\r\nArmy of the Tennessee; and Cruft's division of the Army of the\r\nCumberland.  Sherman had three divisions of his own army, Howard's corps\r\nfrom the Army of the Potomac, and Jefferson C. Davis's division of the\r\nArmy of the Cumberland.  There was no jealousy--hardly rivalry.  Indeed,\r\nI doubt whether officers or men took any note at the time of the fact of\r\nthis intermingling of commands.  All saw a defiant foe surrounding them,\r\nand took it for granted that every move was intended to dislodge him,\r\nand it made no difference where the troops came from so that the end was\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe victory at Chattanooga was won against great odds, considering the\r\nadvantage the enemy had of position, and was accomplished more easily\r\nthan was expected by reason of Bragg's making several grave mistakes:\r\nfirst, in sending away his ablest corps commander with over twenty\r\nthousand troops; second, in sending away a division of troops on the eve\r\nof battle; third, in placing so much of a force on the plain in front of\r\nhis impregnable position.\r\n\r\nIt was known that Mr. Jefferson Davis had visited Bragg on Missionary\r\nRidge a short time before my reaching Chattanooga. It was reported and\r\nbelieved that he had come out to reconcile a serious difference between\r\nBragg and Longstreet, and finding this difficult to do, planned the\r\ncampaign against Knoxville, to be conducted by the latter general.  I\r\nhad known both Bragg and Longstreet before the war, the latter very\r\nwell.  We had been three years at West Point together, and, after my\r\ngraduation, for a time in the same regiment.  Then we served together in\r\nthe Mexican War.  I had known Bragg in Mexico, and met him occasionally\r\nsubsequently.  I could well understand how there might be an\r\nirreconcilable difference between them.\r\n\r\nBragg was a remarkably intelligent and well-informed man, professionally\r\nand otherwise.  He was also thoroughly upright. But he was possessed of\r\nan irascible temper, and was naturally disputatious.  A man of the\r\nhighest moral character and the most correct habits, yet in the old army\r\nhe was in frequent trouble. As a subordinate he was always on the\r\nlookout to catch his commanding officer infringing his prerogatives; as\r\na post commander he was equally vigilant to detect the slightest\r\nneglect, even of the most trivial order.\r\n\r\nI have heard in the old army an anecdote very characteristic of Bragg.\r\nOn one occasion, when stationed at a post of several companies commanded\r\nby a field officer, he was himself commanding one of the companies and\r\nat the same time acting as post quartermaster and commissary.  He was\r\nfirst lieutenant at the time, but his captain was detached on other\r\nduty.  As commander of the company he made a requisition upon the\r\nquartermaster--himself--for something he wanted.  As quartermaster he\r\ndeclined to fill the requisition, and endorsed on the back of it his\r\nreasons for so doing.  As company commander he responded to this, urging\r\nthat his requisition called for nothing but what he was entitled to, and\r\nthat it was the duty of the quartermaster to fill it.  As quartermaster\r\nhe still persisted that he was right.  In this condition of affairs\r\nBragg referred the whole matter to the commanding officer of the post.\r\nThe latter, when he saw the nature of the matter referred, exclaimed:\r\n\"My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarrelled with every officer in the army,\r\nand now you are quarrelling with yourself!\"\r\n\r\nLongstreet was an entirely different man.  He was brave, honest,\r\nintelligent, a very capable soldier, subordinate to his superiors, just\r\nand kind to his subordinates, but jealous of his own rights, which he\r\nhad the courage to maintain.  He was never on the lookout to detect a\r\nslight, but saw one as soon as anybody when intentionally given.\r\n\r\nIt may be that Longstreet was not sent to Knoxville for the reason\r\nstated, but because Mr. Davis had an exalted opinion of his own military\r\ngenius, and thought he saw a chance of \"killing two birds with one\r\nstone.\"  On several occasions during the war he came to the relief of\r\nthe Union army by means of his SUPERIOR MILITARY GENIUS.\r\n\r\nI speak advisedly when I saw Mr. Davis prided himself on his military\r\ncapacity.  He says so himself, virtually, in his answer to the notice of\r\nhis nomination to the Confederate presidency. Some of his generals have\r\nsaid so in their writings since the downfall of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nMy recollection is that my first orders for the battle of Chattanooga\r\nwere as fought.  Sherman was to get on Missionary Ridge, as he did;\r\nHooker to cross the north end of Lookout Mountain, as he did, sweep\r\nacross Chattanooga Valley and get across the south end of the ridge near\r\nRossville.  When Hooker had secured that position the Army of the\r\nCumberland was to assault in the centre.  Before Sherman arrived,\r\nhowever, the order was so changed as that Hooker was directed to come to\r\nChattanooga by the north bank of the Tennessee River.  The waters in the\r\nriver, owing to heavy rains, rose so fast that the bridge at Brown's\r\nFerry could not be maintained in a condition to be used in crossing\r\ntroops upon it.  For this reason Hooker's orders were changed by\r\ntelegraph back to what they were originally.------\r\n\r\nNOTE.--From this point on this volume was written (with the exception of\r\nthe campaign in the Wilderness, which had been previously written) by\r\nGeneral Grant, after his great illness in April, and the present\r\narrangement of the subject-matter was made by him between the 10th and\r\n18th of July, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nTHE RELIEF OF KNOXVILLE--HEADQUARTERS MOVED TO NASHVILLE--VISITING\r\nKNOXVILLE-CIPHER DISPATCHES--WITHHOLDING ORDERS.\r\n\r\nChattanooga now being secure to the National troops beyond any doubt, I\r\nimmediately turned my attention to relieving Knoxville, about the\r\nsituation of which the President, in particular, was very anxious.\r\nPrior to the battles, I had made preparations for sending troops to the\r\nrelief of Burnside at the very earliest moment after securing\r\nChattanooga. We had there two little steamers which had been built and\r\nfitted up from the remains of old boats and put in condition to run.\r\nGeneral Thomas was directed to have one of these boats loaded with\r\nrations and ammunition and move up the Tennessee River to the mouth of\r\nthe Holston, keeping the boat all the time abreast of the troops.\r\nGeneral Granger, with the 4th corps reinforced to make twenty thousand\r\nmen, was to start the moment Missionary Ridge was carried, and under no\r\ncircumstances were the troops to return to their old camps.  With the\r\nprovisions carried, and the little that could be got in the country, it\r\nwas supposed he could hold out until Longstreet was driven away, after\r\nwhich event East Tennessee would furnish abundance of food for\r\nBurnside's army and his own also.\r\n\r\nWhile following the enemy on the 26th, and again on the morning of the\r\n27th, part of the time by the road to Ringgold, I directed Thomas,\r\nverbally, not to start Granger until he received further orders from me;\r\nadvising him that I was going to the front to more fully see the\r\nsituation.  I was not right sure but that Bragg's troops might be over\r\ntheir stampede by the time they reached Dalton.  In that case Bragg\r\nmight think it well to take the road back to Cleveland, move thence\r\ntowards Knoxville, and, uniting with Longstreet, make a sudden dash upon\r\nBurnside.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at Ringgold, however, on the 27th, I saw that the retreat\r\nwas most earnest.  The enemy had been throwing away guns, caissons and\r\nsmall-arms, abandoning provisions, and, altogether, seemed to be moving\r\nlike a disorganized mob, with the exception of Cleburne's division,\r\nwhich was acting as rear-guard to cover the retreat.\r\n\r\nWhen Hooker moved from Rossville toward Ringgold Palmer's division took\r\nthe road to Graysville, and Sherman moved by the way of Chickamauga\r\nStation toward the same point.  As soon as I saw the situation at\r\nRinggold I sent a staff officer back to Chattanooga to advise Thomas of\r\nthe condition of affairs, and direct him by my orders to start Granger\r\nat once.  Feeling now that the troops were already on the march for the\r\nrelief of Burnside I was in no hurry to get back, but stayed at Ringgold\r\nthrough the day to prepare for the return of our troops.\r\n\r\nRinggold is in a valley in the mountains, situated between East\r\nChickamauga Creek and Taylor's Ridge, and about twenty miles south-east\r\nfrom Chattanooga. I arrived just as the artillery that Hooker had left\r\nbehind at Chattanooga Creek got up.  His men were attacking Cleburne's\r\ndivision, which had taken a strong position in the adjacent hills so as\r\nto cover the retreat of the Confederate army through a narrow gorge\r\nwhich presents itself at that point.  Just beyond the gorge the valley\r\nis narrow, and the creek so tortuous that it has to be crossed a great\r\nmany times in the course of the first mile.  This attack was\r\nunfortunate, and cost us some men unnecessarily.  Hooker captured,\r\nhowever, 3 pieces of artillery and 230 prisoners, and 130 rebel dead\r\nwere left upon the field.\r\n\r\nI directed General Hooker to collect the flour and wheat in the\r\nneighboring mills for the use of the troops, and then to destroy the\r\nmills and all other property that could be of use to the enemy, but not\r\nto make any wanton destruction.\r\n\r\nAt this point Sherman came up, having reached Graysville with his\r\ntroops, where he found Palmer had preceded him.  Palmer had picked up\r\nmany prisoners and much abandoned property on the route.  I went back in\r\nthe evening to Graysville with Sherman, remained there over night and\r\ndid not return to Chattanooga until the following night, the 29th.  I\r\nthen found that Thomas had not yet started Granger, thus having lost a\r\nfull day which I deemed of so much importance in determining the fate of\r\nKnoxville.  Thomas and Granger were aware that on the 23d of the month\r\nBurnside had telegraphed that his supplies would last for ten or twelve\r\ndays and during that time he could hold out against Longstreet, but if\r\nnot relieved within the time indicated he would be obliged to surrender\r\nor attempt to retreat.  To effect a retreat would have been an\r\nimpossibility.  He was already very low in ammunition, and with an army\r\npursuing he would not have been able to gather supplies.\r\n\r\nFinding that Granger had not only not started but was very reluctant to\r\ngo, he having decided for himself that it was a very bad move to make, I\r\nsent word to General Sherman of the situation and directed him to march\r\nto the relief of Knoxville.  I also gave him the problem that we had to\r\nsolve--that Burnside had now but four to six days supplies left, and\r\nthat he must be relieved within that time.\r\n\r\nSherman, fortunately, had not started on his return from Graysville,\r\nhaving sent out detachments on the railroad which runs from Dalton to\r\nCleveland and Knoxville to thoroughly destroy that road, and these\r\ntroops had not yet returned to camp.  I was very loath to send Sherman,\r\nbecause his men needed rest after their long march from Memphis and hard\r\nfighting at Chattanooga. But I had become satisfied that Burnside would\r\nnot be rescued if his relief depended upon General Granger's movements.\r\n\r\nSherman had left his camp on the north side of the Tennessee River, near\r\nChattanooga, on the night of the 23d, the men having two days' cooked\r\nrations in their haversacks.  Expecting to be back in their tents by\r\nthat time and to be engaged in battle while out, they took with them\r\nneither overcoats nor blankets. The weather was already cold, and at\r\nnight they must have suffered more or less.  The two days' rations had\r\nalready lasted them five days; and they were now to go through a country\r\nwhich had been run over so much by Confederate troops that there was but\r\nlittle probability of finding much food.  They did, however, succeed in\r\ncapturing some flour.  They also found a good deal of bran in some of\r\nthe mills, which the men made up into bread; and in this and other ways\r\nthey eked out an existence until they could reach Knoxville.\r\n\r\nI was so very anxious that Burnside should get news of the steps being\r\ntaken for his relief, and thus induce him to hold out a little longer if\r\nit became necessary, that I determined to send a message to him.  I\r\ntherefore sent a member of my staff, Colonel J. H. Wilson, to get into\r\nKnoxville if he could report to Burnside the situation fully, and give\r\nhim all the encouragement possible.  Mr. Charles A. Dana was at\r\nChattanooga during the battle, and had been there even before I assumed\r\ncommand.  Mr. Dana volunteered to accompany Colonel Wilson, and did\r\naccompany him.  I put the information of what was being done for the\r\nrelief of Knoxville into writing, and directed that in some way or other\r\nit must be secretly managed so as to have a copy of this fall into the\r\nhands of General Longstreet.  They made the trip safely; General\r\nLongstreet did learn of Sherman's coming in advance of his reaching\r\nthere, and Burnside was prepared to hold out even for a longer time if\r\nit had been necessary.\r\n\r\nBurnside had stretched a boom across the Holston River to catch scows\r\nand flats as they floated down.  On these, by previous arrangements with\r\nthe loyal people of East Tennessee, were placed flour and corn, with\r\nforage and provisions generally, and were thus secured for the use of\r\nthe Union troops.  They also drove cattle into Knoxville by the east\r\nside, which was not covered by the enemy; so that when relief arrived\r\nBurnside had more provisions on hand than when he had last reported.\r\n\r\nOur total loss (not including Burnside's) in all these engagements\r\namounted to 757 killed, 4,529 wounded and 330 missing.  We captured\r\n6,142 prisoners--about 50 per cent. more than the enemy reported for\r\ntheir total loss--40 pieces of artillery, 69 artillery carriages and\r\ncaissons and over 7,000 stands of small-arms.  The enemy's loss in arms\r\nwas probably much greater than here reported, because we picked up a\r\ngreat many that were found abandoned.\r\n\r\nI had at Chattanooga, in round numbers, about 60,000 men.  Bragg had\r\nabout half this number, but his position was supposed to be impregnable.\r\nIt was his own fault that he did not have more men present.  He had sent\r\nLongstreet away with his corps swelled by reinforcements up to over\r\ntwenty thousand men, thus reducing his own force more than one-third and\r\ndepriving himself of the presence of the ablest general of his command.\r\nHe did this, too, after our troops had opened a line of communication by\r\nway of Brown's and Kelly's ferries with Bridgeport, thus securing full\r\nrations and supplies of every kind; and also when he knew reinforcements\r\nwere coming to me.  Knoxville was of no earthly use to him while\r\nChattanooga was in our hands.  If he should capture Chattanooga,\r\nKnoxville with its garrison would have fallen into his hands without a\r\nstruggle.  I have never been able to see the wisdom of this move.\r\n\r\nThen, too, after Sherman had arrived, and when Bragg knew that he was on\r\nthe north side of the Tennessee River, he sent Buckner's division to\r\nreinforce Longstreet.  He also started another division a day later, but\r\nour attack having commenced before it reached Knoxville Bragg ordered it\r\nback.  It had got so far, however, that it could not return to\r\nChattanooga in time to be of service there.  It is possible this latter\r\nblunder may have been made by Bragg having become confused as to what\r\nwas going on on our side.  Sherman had, as already stated, crossed to\r\nthe north side of the Tennessee River at Brown's Ferry, in full view of\r\nBragg's troops from Lookout Mountain, a few days before the attack.\r\nThey then disappeared behind foot hills, and did not come to the view of\r\nthe troops on Missionary Ridge until they met their assault.  Bragg knew\r\nit was Sherman's troops that had crossed, and, they being so long out of\r\nview, may have supposed that they had gone up the north bank of the\r\nTennessee River to the relief of Knoxville and that Longstreet was\r\ntherefore in danger.  But the first great blunder, detaching Longstreet,\r\ncannot be accounted for in any way I know of.  If he had captured\r\nChattanooga, East Tennessee would have fallen without a struggle.  It\r\nwould have been a victory for us to have got our army away from\r\nChattanooga safely.  It was a manifold greater victory to drive away the\r\nbesieging army; a still greater one to defeat that army in his chosen\r\nground and nearly annihilate it.\r\n\r\nThe probabilities are that our loss in killed was the heavier, as we\r\nwere the attacking party.  The enemy reported his loss in killed at 361:\r\nbut as he reported his missing at 4,146, while we held over 6,000 of\r\nthem as prisoners, and there must have been hundreds if not thousands\r\nwho deserted, but little reliance can be placed on this report.  There\r\nwas certainly great dissatisfaction with Bragg on the part of the\r\nsoldiers for his harsh treatment of them, and a disposition to get away\r\nif they could.  Then, too, Chattanooga, following in the same half year\r\nwith Gettysburg in the East and Vicksburg in the West, there was much\r\nthe same feeling in the South at this time that there had been in the\r\nNorth the fall and winter before.  If the same license had been allowed\r\nthe people and press in the South that was allowed in the North,\r\nChattanooga would probably have been the last battle fought for the\r\npreservation of the Union.\r\n\r\nGeneral William F. Smith's services in these battles had been such that\r\nI thought him eminently entitled to promotion.  I was aware that he had\r\npreviously been named by the President for promotion to the grade of\r\nmajor-general, but that the Senate had rejected the nomination.  I was\r\nnot aware of the reasons for this course, and therefore strongly\r\nrecommended him for a major-generalcy.  My recommendation was heeded and\r\nthe appointment made.\r\n\r\nUpon the raising of the siege of Knoxville I, of course, informed the\r\nauthorities at Washington--the President and Secretary of War--of the\r\nfact, which caused great rejoicing there.  The President especially was\r\nrejoiced that Knoxville had been relieved (*18) without further\r\nbloodshed.  The safety of Burnside's army and the loyal people of East\r\nTennessee had been the subject of much anxiety to the President for\r\nseveral months, during which time he was doing all he could to relieve\r\nthe situation; sending a new commander (*19) with a few thousand troops\r\nby the way of Cumberland Gap, and telegraphing me daily, almost hourly,\r\nto \"remember Burnside,\" \"do something for Burnside,\" and other appeals\r\nof like tenor.  He saw no escape for East Tennessee until after our\r\nvictory at Chattanooga. Even then he was afraid that Burnside might be\r\nout of ammunition, in a starving condition, or overpowered:  and his\r\nanxiety was still intense until he heard that Longstreet had been driven\r\nfrom the field.\r\n\r\nBurnside followed Longstreet only to Strawberry Plains, some twenty\r\nmiles or more east, and then stopped, believing that Longstreet would\r\nleave the State.  The latter did not do so, however, but stopped only a\r\nshort distance farther on and subsisted his army for the entire winter\r\noff East Tennessee. Foster now relieved Burnside.  Sherman made\r\ndisposition of his troops along the Tennessee River in accordance with\r\ninstructions.  I left Thomas in command at Chattanooga, and, about the\r\n20th of December, moved my headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nNashville was the most central point from which to communicate with my\r\nentire military division, and also with the authorities at Washington.\r\nWhile remaining at Chattanooga I was liable to have my telegraphic\r\ncommunications cut so as to throw me out of communication with both my\r\ncommand and Washington.\r\n\r\nNothing occurred at Nashville worthy of mention during the winter, (*20)\r\nso I set myself to the task of having troops in positions from which\r\nthey could move to advantage, and in collecting all necessary supplies\r\nso as to be ready to claim a due share of the enemy's attention upon the\r\nappearance of the first good weather in the spring.  I expected to\r\nretain the command I then had, and prepared myself for the campaign\r\nagainst Atlanta. I also had great hopes of having a campaign made\r\nagainst Mobile from the Gulf.  I expected after Atlanta fell to occupy\r\nthat place permanently, and to cut off Lee's army from the West by way\r\nof the road running through Augusta to Atlanta and thence south-west.  I\r\nwas preparing to hold Atlanta with a small garrison, and it was my\r\nexpectation to push through to Mobile if that city was in our\r\npossession:  if not, to Savannah; and in this manner to get possession\r\nof the only east and west railroad that would then be left to the enemy.\r\nBut the spring campaign against Mobile was not made.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Ohio had been getting supplies over Cumberland Gap until\r\ntheir animals had nearly all starved.  I now determined to go myself to\r\nsee if there was any possible chance of using that route in the spring,\r\nand if not to abandon it. Accordingly I left Nashville in the latter\r\npart of December by rail for Chattanooga. From Chattanooga I took one of\r\nthe little steamers previously spoken of as having been built there,\r\nand, putting my horses aboard, went up to the junction of the Clinch\r\nwith the Tennessee.  From that point the railroad had been repaired up\r\nto Knoxville and out east to Strawberry Plains.  I went by rail\r\ntherefore to Knoxville, where I remained for several days.  General John\r\nG. Foster was then commanding the Department of the Ohio.  It was an\r\nintensely cold winter, the thermometer being down as low as zero every\r\nmorning for more than a week while I was at Knoxville and on my way from\r\nthere on horseback to Lexington, Kentucky, the first point where I could\r\nreach rail to carry me back to my headquarters at Nashville.\r\n\r\nThe road over Cumberland Gap, and back of it, was strewn with debris of\r\nbroken wagons and dead animals, much as I had found it on my first trip\r\nto Chattanooga over Waldron's Ridge.  The road had been cut up to as\r\ngreat a depth as clay could be by mules and wagons, and in that\r\ncondition frozen; so that the ride of six days from Strawberry Plains to\r\nLexington over these holes and knobs in the road was a very cheerless\r\none, and very disagreeable.\r\n\r\nI found a great many people at home along that route, both in Tennessee\r\nand Kentucky, and, almost universally, intensely loyal.  They would\r\ncollect in little places where we would stop of evenings, to see me,\r\ngenerally hearing of my approach before we arrived.  The people\r\nnaturally expected to see the commanding general the oldest person in\r\nthe party.  I was then forty-one years of age, while my medical director\r\nwas gray-haired and probably twelve or more years my senior.  The crowds\r\nwould generally swarm around him, and thus give me an opportunity of\r\nquietly dismounting and getting into the house.  It also gave me an\r\nopportunity of hearing passing remarks from one spectator to another\r\nabout their general.  Those remarks were apt to be more complimentary to\r\nthe cause than to the appearance of the supposed general, owing to his\r\nbeing muffled up, and also owing to the travel-worn condition we were\r\nall in after a hard day's ride.  I was back in Nashville by the 13th of\r\nJanuary, 1864.\r\n\r\nWhen I started on this trip it was necessary for me to have some person\r\nalong who could turn dispatches into cipher, and who could also read the\r\ncipher dispatches which I was liable to receive daily and almost hourly.\r\nUnder the rules of the War Department at that time, Mr. Stanton had\r\ntaken entire control of the matter of regulating the telegraph and\r\ndetermining how it should be used, and of saying who, and who alone,\r\nshould have the ciphers.  The operators possessed of the ciphers, as\r\nwell as the ciphers used, were practically independent of the commanders\r\nwhom they were serving immediately under, and had to report to the War\r\nDepartment through General Stager all the dispatches which they received\r\nor forwarded.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to leave the telegraphic operator back at Nashville,\r\nbecause that was the point at which all dispatches to me would come, to\r\nbe forwarded from there.  As I have said, it was necessary for me also\r\nto have an operator during this inspection who had possession of this\r\ncipher to enable me to telegraph to my division and to the War\r\nDepartment without my dispatches being read by all the operators along\r\nthe line of wires over which they were transmitted.  Accordingly I\r\nordered the cipher operator to turn over the key to Captain Cyrus B.\r\nComstock, of the Corps of Engineers, whom I had selected as a wise and\r\ndiscreet man who certainly could be trusted with the cipher if the\r\noperator at my headquarters could.\r\n\r\nThe operator refused point blank to turn over the key to Captain\r\nComstock as directed by me, stating that his orders from the War\r\nDepartment were not to give it to anybody--the commanding general or any\r\none else.  I told him I would see whether he would or not.  He said that\r\nif he did he would be punished.  I told him if he did not he most\r\ncertainly would be punished. Finally, seeing that punishment was certain\r\nif he refused longer to obey my order, and being somewhat remote (even\r\nif he was not protected altogether from the consequences of his\r\ndisobedience to his orders) from the War Department, he yielded.  When I\r\nreturned from Knoxville I found quite a commotion.  The operator had\r\nbeen reprimanded very severely and ordered to be relieved.  I informed\r\nthe Secretary of War, or his assistant secretary in charge of the\r\ntelegraph, Stager, that the man could not be relieved, for he had only\r\nobeyed my orders.  It was absolutely necessary for me to have the\r\ncipher, and the man would most certainly have been punished if he had\r\nnot delivered it; that they would have to punish me if they punished\r\nanybody, or words to that effect.\r\n\r\nThis was about the only thing approaching a disagreeable difference\r\nbetween the Secretary of War and myself that occurred until the war was\r\nover, when we had another little spat.  Owing to his natural disposition\r\nto assume all power and control in all matters that he had anything\r\nwhatever to do with, he boldly took command of the armies, and, while\r\nissuing no orders on the subject, prohibited any order from me going out\r\nof the adjutant-general's office until he had approved it.  This was\r\ndone by directing the adjutant-general to hold any orders that came from\r\nme to be issued from the adjutant-general's office until he had examined\r\nthem and given his approval.  He never disturbed himself, either, in\r\nexamining my orders until it was entirely convenient for him; so that\r\norders which I had prepared would often lie there three or four days\r\nbefore he would sanction them.  I remonstrated against this in writing,\r\nand the Secretary apologetically restored me to my rightful position of\r\nGeneral-in-Chief of the Army.  But he soon lapsed again and took control\r\nmuch as before.\r\n\r\nAfter the relief of Knoxville Sherman had proposed to Burnside that he\r\nshould go with him to drive Longstreet out of Tennessee; but Burnside\r\nassured him that with the troops which had been brought by Granger, and\r\nwhich were to be left, he would be amply prepared to dispose of\r\nLongstreet without availing himself of this offer.  As before stated\r\nSherman's command had left their camps north of the Tennessee, near\r\nChattanooga, with two days' rations in their haversacks, without coats\r\nor blankets, and without many wagons, expecting to return to their camps\r\nby the end of that time.  The weather was now cold and they were\r\nsuffering, but still they were ready to make the further sacrifice, had\r\nit been required, for the good of the cause which had brought them into\r\nservice.  Sherman, having accomplished the object for which he was sent,\r\nmarched back leisurely to his old camp on the Tennessee River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS IN MISSISSIPPI--LONGSTREET IN EAST TENNESSEE--COMMISSIONED\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL--COMMANDING THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES--FIRST\r\nINTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return from Knoxville I ordered Sherman to distribute his\r\nforces from Stevenson to Decatur and thence north to Nashville; Sherman\r\nsuggested that he be permitted to go back to Mississippi, to the limits\r\nof his own department and where most of his army still remained, for the\r\npurpose of clearing out what Confederates might still be left on the\r\neast bank of the Mississippi River to impede its navigation by our\r\nboats.  He expected also to have the co-operation of Banks to do the\r\nsame thing on the west shore.  Of course I approved heartily.\r\n\r\nAbout the 10th of January Sherman was back in Memphis, where Hurlbut\r\ncommanded, and got together his Memphis men, or ordered them collected\r\nand sent to Vicksburg.  He then went to Vicksburg and out to where\r\nMcPherson was in command, and had him organize his surplus troops so as\r\nto give him about 20,000 men in all.\r\n\r\nSherman knew that General (Bishop) Polk was occupying Meridian with his\r\nheadquarters, and had two divisions of infantry with a considerable\r\nforce of cavalry scattered west of him.  He determined, therefore, to\r\nmove directly upon Meridian.\r\n\r\nI had sent some 2,500 cavalry under General Sooy Smith to Sherman's\r\ndepartment, and they had mostly arrived before Sherman got to Memphis.\r\nHurlbut had 7,000 cavalry, and Sherman ordered him to reinforce Smith so\r\nas to give the latter a force of about 7,000 with which to go against\r\nForrest, who was then known to be south-east from Memphis.  Smith was\r\nordered to move about the 1st of February.\r\n\r\nWhile Sherman was waiting at Vicksburg for the arrival of Hurlbut with\r\nhis surplus men, he sent out scouts to ascertain the position and\r\nstrength of the enemy and to bring back all the information they could\r\ngather.  When these scouts returned it was through them that he got the\r\ninformation of General Polk's being at Meridian, and of the strength and\r\ndisposition of his command.\r\n\r\nForrest had about 4,000 cavalry with him, composed of thoroughly\r\nwell-disciplined men, who under so able a leader were very effective.\r\nSmith's command was nearly double that of Forrest, but not equal, man to\r\nman, for the lack of a successful experience such as Forrest's men had\r\nhad.  The fact is, troops who have fought a few battles and won, and\r\nfollowed up their victories, improve upon what they were before to an\r\nextent that can hardly be counted by percentage.  The difference in\r\nresult is often decisive victory instead of inglorious defeat.  This\r\nsame difference, too, is often due to the way troops are officered, and\r\nfor the particular kind of warfare which Forrest had carried on neither\r\narmy could present a more effective officer than he was.\r\n\r\nSherman got off on the 3d of February and moved out on his expedition,\r\nmeeting with no opposition whatever until he crossed the Big Black, and\r\nwith no great deal of opposition after that until he reached Jackson,\r\nMississippi.  This latter place he reached on the 6th or 7th, Brandon on\r\nthe 8th, and Morton on the 9th.  Up to this time he moved in two columns\r\nto enable him to get a good supply of forage, etc., and expedite the\r\nmarch. Here, however, there were indications of the concentration of\r\nConfederate infantry, and he was obliged to keep his army close\r\ntogether.  He had no serious engagement; but he met some of the enemy\r\nwho destroyed a few of his wagons about Decatur, Mississippi, where, by\r\nthe way, Sherman himself came near being picked up.\r\n\r\nHe entered Meridian on the 14th of the month, the enemy having retreated\r\ntoward Demopolis, Alabama. He spent several days in Meridian in\r\nthoroughly destroying the railroad to the north and south, and also for\r\nthe purpose of hearing from Sooy Smith, who he supposed had met Forrest\r\nbefore this time and he hoped had gained a decisive victory because of a\r\nsuperiority of numbers. Hearing nothing of him, however, he started on\r\nhis return trip to Vicksburg.  There he learned that Smith, while\r\nwaiting for a few of his men who had been ice-bound in the Ohio River,\r\ninstead of getting off on the 1st as expected, had not left until the\r\n11th.  Smith did meet Forrest, but the result was decidedly in Forrest's\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nSherman had written a letter to Banks, proposing a co-operative movement\r\nwith him against Shreveport, subject to my approval.  I disapproved of\r\nSherman's going himself, because I had other important work for him to\r\ndo, but consented that he might send a few troops to the aid of Banks,\r\nthough their time to remain absent must be limited.  We must have them\r\nfor the spring campaign.  The trans-Mississippi movement proved\r\nabortive.\r\n\r\nMy eldest son, who had accompanied me on the Vicksburg campaign and\r\nsiege, had while there contracted disease, which grew worse, until he\r\nhad grown so dangerously ill that on the 24th of January I obtained\r\npermission to go to St. Louis, where he was staying at the time, to see\r\nhim, hardly expecting to find him alive on my arrival.  While I was\r\npermitted to go, I was not permitted to turn over my command to any one\r\nelse, but was directed to keep the headquarters with me and to\r\ncommunicate regularly with all parts of my division and with Washington,\r\njust as though I had remained at Nashville.\r\n\r\nWhen I obtained this leave I was at Chattanooga, having gone there again\r\nto make preparations to have the troops of Thomas in the southern part\r\nof Tennessee co-operate with Sherman's movement in Mississippi.  I\r\ndirected Thomas, and Logan who was at Scottsboro, Alabama, to keep up a\r\nthreatening movement to the south against J. E. Johnston, who had again\r\nrelieved Bragg, for the purpose of making him keep as many troops as\r\npossible there.\r\n\r\nI learned through Confederate sources that Johnston had already sent two\r\ndivisions in the direction of Mobile, presumably to operate against\r\nSherman, and two more divisions to Longstreet in East Tennessee.  Seeing\r\nthat Johnston had depleted in this way, I directed Thomas to send at\r\nleast ten thousand men, besides Stanley's division which was already to\r\nthe east, into East Tennessee, and notified Schofield, who was now in\r\ncommand in East Tennessee, of this movement of troops into his\r\ndepartment and also of the reinforcements Longstreet had received.  My\r\nobject was to drive Longstreet out of East Tennessee as a part of the\r\npreparations for my spring campaign.\r\n\r\nAbout this time General Foster, who had been in command of the\r\nDepartment of the Ohio after Burnside until Schofield relieved him\r\n(*21), advised me that he thought it would be a good thing to keep\r\nLongstreet just where he was; that he was perfectly quiet in East\r\nTennessee, and if he was forced to leave there, his whole well-equipped\r\narmy would be free to go to any place where it could effect the most for\r\ntheir cause.  I thought the advice was good, and, adopting that view,\r\ncountermanded the orders for pursuit of Longstreet.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of February I ordered Thomas to take Dalton and hold it, if\r\npossible; and I directed him to move without delay. Finding that he had\r\nnot moved, on the 17th I urged him again to start, telling him how\r\nimportant it was, that the object of the movement was to co-operate with\r\nSherman, who was moving eastward and might be in danger.  Then again on\r\nthe 21st, he not yet having started, I asked him if he could not start\r\nthe next day.  He finally got off on the 22d or 23d.  The enemy fell\r\nback from his front without a battle, but took a new position quite as\r\nstrong and farther to the rear.  Thomas reported that he could not go\r\nany farther, because it was impossible with his poor teams, nearly\r\nstarved, to keep up supplies until the railroads were repaired.  He soon\r\nfell back.\r\n\r\nSchofield also had to return for the same reason.  He could not carry\r\nsupplies with him, and Longstreet was between him and the supplies still\r\nleft in the country.  Longstreet, in his retreat, would be moving\r\ntowards his supplies, while our forces, following, would be receding\r\nfrom theirs.  On the 2d of March, however, I learned of Sherman's\r\nsuccess, which eased my mind very much.  The next day, the 3d, I was\r\nordered to Washington.\r\n\r\nThe bill restoring the grade of lieutenant-general of the army had\r\npassed through Congress and became a law on the 26th of February.  My\r\nnomination had been sent to the Senate on the 1st of March and confirmed\r\nthe next day (the 2d).  I was ordered to Washington on the 3d to receive\r\nmy commission, and started the day following that.  The commission was\r\nhanded to me on the 9th.  It was delivered to me at the Executive\r\nMansion by President Lincoln in the presence of his Cabinet, my eldest\r\nson, those of my staff who were with me and and a few other visitors.\r\n\r\nThe President in presenting my commission read from a paper--stating,\r\nhowever, as a preliminary, and prior to the delivery of it, that he had\r\ndrawn that up on paper, knowing my disinclination to speak in public,\r\nand handed me a copy in advance so that I might prepare a few lines of\r\nreply.  The President said:\r\n\r\n\"General Grant, the nation's appreciation of what you have done, and its\r\nreliance upon you for what remains to be done in the existing great\r\nstruggle, are now presented, with this commission constituting you\r\nlieutenant-general in the Army of the United States.  With this high\r\nhonor, devolves upon you, also, a corresponding responsibility.  As the\r\ncountry herein trusts you, so, under God, it will sustain you.  I\r\nscarcely need to add, that, with what I here speak for the nation, goes\r\nmy own hearty personal concurrence.\"\r\n\r\nTo this I replied:  \"Mr. President, I accept the commission, with\r\ngratitude for the high honor conferred.  With the aid of the noble\r\narmies that have fought in so many fields for our common country, it\r\nwill be my earnest endeavor not to disappoint your expectations.  I feel\r\nthe full weight of the responsibilities now devolving on me; and I know\r\nthat if they are met, it will be due to those armies, and above all, to\r\nthe favor of that Providence which leads both nations and men.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th I visited the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac at\r\nBrandy Station; then returned to Washington, and pushed west at once to\r\nmake my arrangements for turning over the commands there and giving\r\ngeneral directions for the preparations to be made for the spring\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nIt had been my intention before this to remain in the West, even if I\r\nwas made lieutenant-general; but when I got to Washington and saw the\r\nsituation it was plain that here was the point for the commanding\r\ngeneral to be.  No one else could, probably, resist the pressure that\r\nwould be brought to bear upon him to desist from his own plans and\r\npursue others.  I determined, therefore, before I started back to have\r\nSherman advanced to my late position, McPherson to Sherman's in command\r\nof the department, and Logan to the command of McPherson's corps. These\r\nchanges were all made on my recommendation and without hesitation.  My\r\ncommission as lieutenant-general was given to me on the 9th of March,\r\n1864.  On the following day, as already stated, I visited General Meade,\r\ncommanding the Army of the Potomac, at his headquarters at Brandy\r\nStation, north of the Rapidan.  I had known General Meade slightly in\r\nthe Mexican war, but had not met him since until this visit.  I was a\r\nstranger to most of the Army of the Potomac, I might say to all except\r\nthe officers of the regular army who had served in the Mexican war.\r\nThere had been some changes ordered in the organization of that army\r\nbefore my promotion.  One was the consolidation of five corps into\r\nthree, thus throwing some officers of rank out of important commands.\r\nMeade evidently thought that I might want to make still one more change\r\nnot yet ordered.  He said to me that I might want an officer who had\r\nserved with me in the West, mentioning Sherman specially, to take his\r\nplace.  If so, he begged me not to hesitate about making the change.  He\r\nurged that the work before us was of such vast importance to the whole\r\nnation that the feeling or wishes of no one person should stand in the\r\nway of selecting the right men for all positions.  For himself, he would\r\nserve to the best of his ability wherever placed.  I assured him that I\r\nhad no thought of substituting any one for him.  As to Sherman, he could\r\nnot be spared from the West.\r\n\r\nThis incident gave me even a more favorable opinion of Meade than did\r\nhis great victory at Gettysburg the July before.  It is men who wait to\r\nbe selected, and not those who seek, from whom we may always expect the\r\nmost efficient service.\r\n\r\nMeade's position afterwards proved embarrassing to me if not to him.  He\r\nwas commanding an army and, for nearly a year previous to my taking\r\ncommand of all the armies, was in supreme command of the Army of the\r\nPotomac--except from the authorities at Washington.  All other general\r\nofficers occupying similar positions were independent in their commands\r\nso far as any one present with them was concerned.  I tried to make\r\nGeneral Meade's position as nearly as possible what it would have been\r\nif I had been in Washington or any other place away from his command.  I\r\ntherefore gave all orders for the movements of the Army of the Potomac\r\nto Meade to have them executed.  To avoid the necessity of having to\r\ngive orders direct, I established my headquarters near his, unless there\r\nwere reasons for locating them elsewhere.  This sometimes happened, and\r\nI had on occasions to give orders direct to the troops affected.  On the\r\n11th I returned to Washington and, on the day after, orders were\r\npublished by the War Department placing me in command of all the armies.\r\nI had left Washington the night before to return to my old command in\r\nthe West and to meet Sherman whom I had telegraphed to join me in\r\nNashville.\r\n\r\nSherman assumed command of the military division of the Mississippi on\r\nthe 18th of March, and we left Nashville together for Cincinnati.  I had\r\nSherman accompany me that far on my way back to Washington so that we\r\ncould talk over the matters about which I wanted to see him, without\r\nlosing any more time from my new command than was necessary.  The first\r\npoint which I wished to discuss was particularly about the co-operation\r\nof his command with mine when the spring campaign should commence. There\r\nwere also other and minor points, minor as compared with the great\r\nimportance of the question to be decided by sanguinary war--the\r\nrestoration to duty of officers who had been relieved from important\r\ncommands, namely McClellan, Burnside and Fremont in the East, and Buell,\r\nMcCook, Negley and Crittenden in the West.\r\n\r\nSome time in the winter of 1863-64 I had been invited by the\r\ngeneral-in-chief to give my views of the campaign I thought advisable\r\nfor the command under me--now Sherman's.  General J. E. Johnston was\r\ndefending Atlanta and the interior of Georgia with an army, the largest\r\npart of which was stationed at Dalton, about 38 miles south of\r\nChattanooga. Dalton is at the junction of the railroad from Cleveland\r\nwith the one from Chattanooga to Atlanta.\r\n\r\nThere could have been no difference of opinion as to the first duty of\r\nthe armies of the military division of the Mississippi.  Johnston's army\r\nwas the first objective, and that important railroad centre, Atlanta,\r\nthe second.  At the time I wrote General Halleck giving my views of the\r\napproaching campaign, and at the time I met General Sherman, it was\r\nexpected that General Banks would be through with the campaign which he\r\nhad been ordered upon before my appointment to the command of all the\r\narmies, and would be ready to co-operate with the armies east of the\r\nMississippi, his part in the programme being to move upon Mobile by land\r\nwhile the navy would close the harbor and assist to the best of its\r\nability. (*22) The plan therefore was for Sherman to attack Johnston and\r\ndestroy his army if possible, to capture Atlanta and hold it, and with\r\nhis troops and those of Banks to hold a line through to Mobile, or at\r\nleast to hold Atlanta and command the railroad running east and west,\r\nand the troops from one or other of the armies to hold important points\r\non the southern road, the only east and west road that would be left in\r\nthe possession of the enemy.  This would cut the Confederacy in two\r\nagain, as our gaining possession of the Mississippi River had done\r\nbefore.  Banks was not ready in time for the part assigned to him, and\r\ncircumstances that could not be foreseen determined the campaign which\r\nwas afterwards made, the success and grandeur of which has resounded\r\nthroughout all lands.\r\n\r\nIn regard to restoring officers who had been relieved from important\r\ncommands to duty again, I left Sherman to look after those who had been\r\nremoved in the West while I looked out for the rest.  I directed,\r\nhowever, that he should make no assignment until I could speak to the\r\nSecretary of War about the matter.  I shortly after recommended to the\r\nSecretary the assignment of General Buell to duty.  I received the\r\nassurance that duty would be offered to him; and afterwards the\r\nSecretary told me that he had offered Buell an assignment and that the\r\nlatter had declined it, saying that it would be degradation to accept\r\nthe assignment offered.  I understood afterwards that he refused to\r\nserve under either Sherman or Canby because he had ranked them both.\r\nBoth graduated before him and ranked him in the old army.  Sherman\r\nranked him as a brigadier-general.  All of them ranked me in the old\r\narmy, and Sherman and Buell did as brigadiers.  The worst excuse a\r\nsoldier can make for declining service is that he once ranked the\r\ncommander he is ordered to report to.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of March I was back in Washington, and on the 26th took up my\r\nheadquarters at Culpeper Court-House, a few miles south of the\r\nheadquarters of the Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nAlthough hailing from Illinois myself, the State of the President, I\r\nnever met Mr. Lincoln until called to the capital to receive my\r\ncommission as lieutenant-general.  I knew him, however, very well and\r\nfavorably from the accounts given by officers under me at the West who\r\nhad known him all their lives.  I had also read the remarkable series of\r\ndebates between Lincoln and Douglas a few years before, when they were\r\nrival candidates for the United States Senate.  I was then a resident of\r\nMissouri, and by no means a \"Lincoln man\" in that contest; but I\r\nrecognized then his great ability.\r\n\r\nIn my first interview with Mr. Lincoln alone he stated to me that he had\r\nnever professed to be a military man or to know how campaigns should be\r\nconducted, and never wanted to interfere in them:  but that\r\nprocrastination on the part of commanders, and the pressure from the\r\npeople at the North and Congress, WHICH WAS ALWAYS WITH HIM, forced him\r\ninto issuing his series of \"Military Orders\"--one, two, three, etc.  He\r\ndid not know but they were all wrong, and did know that some of them\r\nwere.  All he wanted or had ever wanted was some one who would take the\r\nresponsibility and act, and call on him for all the assistance needed,\r\npledging himself to use all the power of the government in rendering\r\nsuch assistance.  Assuring him that I would do the best I could with the\r\nmeans at hand, and avoid as far as possible annoying him or the War\r\nDepartment, our first interview ended.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War I had met once before only, but felt that I knew\r\nhim better.\r\n\r\nWhile commanding in West Tennessee we had occasionally held\r\nconversations over the wires, at night, when they were not being\r\notherwise used.  He and General Halleck both cautioned me against giving\r\nthe President my plans of campaign, saying that he was so kind-hearted,\r\nso averse to refusing anything asked of him, that some friend would be\r\nsure to get from him all he knew.  I should have said that in our\r\ninterview the President told me he did not want to know what I proposed\r\nto do.  But he submitted a plan of campaign of his own which he wanted\r\nme to hear and then do as I pleased about.  He brought out a map of\r\nVirginia on which he had evidently marked every position occupied by the\r\nFederal and Confederate armies up to that time.  He pointed out on the\r\nmap two streams which empty into the Potomac, and suggested that the\r\narmy might be moved on boats and landed between the mouths of these\r\nstreams.  We would then have the Potomac to bring our supplies, and the\r\ntributaries would protect our flanks while we moved out.  I listened\r\nrespectfully, but did not suggest that the same streams would protect\r\nLee's flanks while he was shutting us up.\r\n\r\nI did not communicate my plans to the President, nor did I to the\r\nSecretary of War or to General Halleck.\r\n\r\nMarch the 26th my headquarters were, as stated, at Culpeper, and the\r\nwork of preparing for an early campaign commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY SITUATION--PLANS FOR THE CAMPAIGN--SHERIDAN ASSIGNED TO\r\nCOMMAND OF THE CAVALRY--FLANK MOVEMENTS--FORREST AT FORT PILLOW--GENERAL\r\nBANKS'S EXPEDITION--COLONEL MOSBY--AN INCIDENT OF THE WILDERNESS\r\nCAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nWhen I assumed command of all the armies the situation was about this:\r\nthe Mississippi River was guarded from St. Louis to its mouth; the line\r\nof the Arkansas was held, thus giving us all the North-west north of\r\nthat river.  A few points in Louisiana not remote from the river were\r\nheld by the Federal troops, as was also the mouth of the Rio Grande.\r\nEast of the Mississippi we held substantially all north of the Memphis\r\nand Charleston Railroad as far east as Chattanooga, thence along the\r\nline of the Tennessee and Holston rivers, taking in nearly all of the\r\nState of Tennessee.  West Virginia was in our hands; and that part of\r\nold Virginia north of the Rapidan and east of the Blue Ridge we also\r\nheld.  On the sea-coast we had Fortress Monroe and Norfolk in Virginia;\r\nPlymouth, Washington and New Berne in North Carolina; Beaufort, Folly\r\nand Morris islands, Hilton Head, Port Royal and Fort Pulaski in South\r\nCarolina and Georgia; Fernandina, St. Augustine, Key West and Pensacola\r\nin Florida. The balance of the Southern territory, an empire in extent,\r\nwas still in the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nSherman, who had succeeded me in the command of the military division of\r\nthe Mississippi, commanded all the troops in the territory west of the\r\nAlleghanies and north of Natchez, with a large movable force about\r\nChattanooga. His command was subdivided into four departments, but the\r\ncommanders all reported to Sherman and were subject to his orders.  This\r\narrangement, however, insured the better protection of all lines of\r\ncommunication through the acquired territory, for the reason that these\r\ndifferent department commanders could act promptly in case of a sudden\r\nor unexpected raid within their respective jurisdictions without\r\nawaiting the orders of the division commander.\r\n\r\nIn the East the opposing forces stood in substantially the same\r\nrelations towards each other as three years before, or when the war\r\nbegan; they were both between the Federal and Confederate capitals.  It\r\nis true, footholds had been secured by us on the sea-coast, in Virginia\r\nand North Carolina, but, beyond that, no substantial advantage had been\r\ngained by either side.  Battles had been fought of as great severity as\r\nhad ever been known in war, over ground from the James River and\r\nChickahominy, near Richmond, to Gettysburg and Chambersburg, in\r\nPennsylvania, with indecisive results, sometimes favorable to the\r\nNational army, sometimes to the Confederate army; but in every instance,\r\nI believe, claimed as victories for the South by the Southern press if\r\nnot by the Southern generals.  The Northern press, as a whole, did not\r\ndiscourage these claims; a portion of it always magnified rebel success\r\nand belittled ours, while another portion, most sincerely earnest in\r\ntheir desire for the preservation of the Union and the overwhelming\r\nsuccess of the Federal armies, would nevertheless generally express\r\ndissatisfaction with whatever victories were gained because they were\r\nnot more complete.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the Army of the Potomac not engaged in guarding lines of\r\ncommunication was on the northern bank of the Rapidan.  The Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia confronting it on the opposite bank of the same river,\r\nwas strongly intrenched and commanded by the acknowledged ablest general\r\nin the Confederate army.  The country back to the James River is cut up\r\nwith many streams, generally narrow, deep, and difficult to cross except\r\nwhere bridged.  The region is heavily timbered, and the roads narrow,\r\nand very bad after the least rain.  Such an enemy was not, of course,\r\nunprepared with adequate fortifications at convenient intervals all the\r\nway back to Richmond, so that when driven from one fortified position\r\nthey would always have another farther to the rear to fall back into.\r\n\r\nTo provision an army, campaigning against so formidable a foe through\r\nsuch a country, from wagons alone seemed almost impossible.  System and\r\ndiscipline were both essential to its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe Union armies were now divided into nineteen departments, though four\r\nof them in the West had been concentrated into a single military\r\ndivision.  The Army of the Potomac was a separate command and had no\r\nterritorial limits.  There were thus seventeen distinct commanders.\r\nBefore this time these various armies had acted separately and\r\nindependently of each other, giving the enemy an opportunity often of\r\ndepleting one command, not pressed, to reinforce another more actively\r\nengaged.  I determined to stop this.  To this end I regarded the Army of\r\nthe Potomac as the centre, and all west to Memphis along the line\r\ndescribed as our position at the time, and north of it, the right wing;\r\nthe Army of the James, under General Butler, as the left wing, and all\r\nthe troops south, as a force in rear of the enemy.  Some of these latter\r\nwere occupying positions from which they could not render service\r\nproportionate to their numerical strength.  All such were depleted to\r\nthe minimum necessary to hold their positions as a guard against\r\nblockade runners; where they could not do this their positions were\r\nabandoned altogether.  In this way ten thousand men were added to the\r\nArmy of the James from South Carolina alone, with General Gillmore in\r\ncommand.  It was not contemplated that General Gillmore should leave his\r\ndepartment; but as most of his troops were taken, presumably for active\r\nservice, he asked to accompany them and was permitted to do so.\r\nOfficers and soldiers on furlough, of whom there were many thousands,\r\nwere ordered to their proper commands; concentration was the order of\r\nthe day, and to have it accomplished in time to advance at the earliest\r\nmoment the roads would permit was the problem.\r\n\r\nAs a reinforcement to the Army of the Potomac, or to act in support of\r\nit, the 9th army corps, over twenty thousand strong, under General\r\nBurnside, had been rendezvoused at Annapolis, Maryland.  This was an\r\nadmirable position for such a reinforcement.  The corps could be brought\r\nat the last moment as a reinforcement to the Army of the Potomac, or it\r\ncould be thrown on the sea-coast, south of Norfolk, in Virginia or North\r\nCarolina, to operate against Richmond from that direction.  In fact\r\nBurnside and the War Department both thought the 9th corps was intended\r\nfor such an expedition up to the last moment.\r\n\r\nMy general plan now was to concentrate all the force possible against\r\nthe Confederate armies in the field.  There were but two such, as we\r\nhave seen, east of the Mississippi River and facing north.  The Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee commanding, was on the south\r\nbank of the Rapidan, confronting the Army of the Potomac; the second,\r\nunder General Joseph E. Johnston, was at Dalton, Georgia, opposed to\r\nSherman who was still at Chattanooga. Beside these main armies the\r\nConfederates had to guard the Shenandoah Valley, a great storehouse to\r\nfeed their armies from, and their line of communications from Richmond\r\nto Tennessee.  Forrest, a brave and intrepid cavalry general, was in the\r\nWest with a large force; making a larger command necessary to hold what\r\nwe had gained in Middle and West Tennessee.  We could not abandon any\r\nterritory north of the line held by the enemy because it would lay the\r\nNorthern States open to invasion.  But as the Army of the Potomac was\r\nthe principal garrison for the protection of Washington even while it\r\nwas moving on Lee, so all the forces to the west, and the Army of the\r\nJames, guarded their special trusts when advancing from them as well as\r\nwhen remaining at them.  Better indeed, for they forced the enemy to\r\nguard his own lines and resources at a greater distance from ours, and\r\nwith a greater force.  Little expeditions could not so well be sent out\r\nto destroy a bridge or tear up a few miles of railroad track, burn a\r\nstorehouse, or inflict other little annoyances.  Accordingly I arranged\r\nfor a simultaneous movement all along the line.  Sherman was to move\r\nfrom Chattanooga, Johnston's army and Atlanta being his objective\r\npoints. (*23)  Crook, commanding in West Virginia, was to move from the\r\nmouth of the Gauley River with a cavalry force and some artillery, the\r\nVirginia and Tennessee Railroad to be his objective.  Either the enemy\r\nwould have to keep a large force to protect their communications, or see\r\nthem destroyed and a large amount of forage and provision, which they so\r\nmuch needed, fall into our hands.  Sigel was in command in the Valley of\r\nVirginia. He was to advance up the valley, covering the North from an\r\ninvasion through that channel as well while advancing as by remaining\r\nnear Harper's Ferry.  Every mile he advanced also gave us possession of\r\nstores on which Lee relied.  Butler was to advance by the James River,\r\nhaving Richmond and Petersburg as his objective.\r\n\r\nBefore the advance commenced I visited Butler at Fort Monroe. This was\r\nthe first time I had ever met him.  Before giving him any order as to\r\nthe part he was to play in the approaching campaign I invited his views.\r\nThey were very much such as I intended to direct, and as I did direct\r\n(*24), in writing, before leaving.\r\n\r\nGeneral W. F. Smith, who had been promoted to the rank of major-general\r\nshortly after the battle of Chattanooga on my recommendation, had not\r\nyet been confirmed.  I found a decided prejudice against his\r\nconfirmation by a majority of the Senate, but I insisted that his\r\nservices had been such that he should be rewarded.  My wishes were now\r\nreluctantly complied with, and I assigned him to the command of one of\r\nthe corps under General Butler.  I was not long in finding out that the\r\nobjections to Smith's promotion were well founded.\r\n\r\nIn one of my early interviews with the President I expressed my\r\ndissatisfaction with the little that had been accomplished by the\r\ncavalry so far in the war, and the belief that it was capable of\r\naccomplishing much more than it had done if under a thorough leader.  I\r\nsaid I wanted the very best man in the army for that command.  Halleck\r\nwas present and spoke up, saying: \"How would Sheridan do?\"  I replied:\r\n\"The very man I want.\" The President said I could have anybody I wanted.\r\nSheridan was telegraphed for that day, and on his arrival was assigned\r\nto the command of the cavalry corps with the Army of the Potomac.  This\r\nrelieved General Alfred Pleasonton.  It was not a reflection on that\r\nofficer, however, for I did not know but that he had been as efficient\r\nas any other cavalry commander.\r\n\r\nBanks in the Department of the Gulf was ordered to assemble all the\r\ntroops he had at New Orleans in time to join in the general move, Mobile\r\nto be his objective.\r\n\r\nAt this time I was not entirely decided as to whether I should move the\r\nArmy of the Potomac by the right flank of the enemy, or by his left.\r\nEach plan presented advantages. (*25)  If by his right--my left--the\r\nPotomac, Chesapeake Bay and tributaries would furnish us an easy hauling\r\ndistance of every position the army could occupy from the Rapidan to the\r\nJames River.  But Lee could, if he chose, detach or move his whole army\r\nnorth on a line rather interior to the one I would have to take in\r\nfollowing.  A movement by his left--our right--would obviate this; but\r\nall that was done would have to be done with the supplies and ammunition\r\nwe started with.  All idea of adopting this latter plan was abandoned\r\nwhen the limited quantity of supplies possible to take with us was\r\nconsidered.  The country over which we would have to pass was so\r\nexhausted of all food or forage that we would be obliged to carry\r\neverything with us.\r\n\r\nWhile these preparations were going on the enemy was not entirely idle.\r\nIn the West Forrest made a raid in West Tennessee up to the northern\r\nborder, capturing the garrison of four or five hundred men at Union\r\nCity, and followed it up by an attack on Paducah, Kentucky, on the banks\r\nof the Ohio.  While he was able to enter the city he failed to capture\r\nthe forts or any part of the garrison.  On the first intelligence of\r\nForrest's raid I telegraphed Sherman to send all his cavalry against\r\nhim, and not to let him get out of the trap he had put himself into.\r\nSherman had anticipated me by sending troops against him before he got\r\nmy order.\r\n\r\nForrest, however, fell back rapidly, and attacked the troops at Fort\r\nPillow, a station for the protection of the navigation of the\r\nMississippi River.  The garrison consisted of a regiment of colored\r\ntroops, infantry, and a detachment of Tennessee cavalry.  These troops\r\nfought bravely, but were overpowered.  I will leave Forrest in his\r\ndispatches to tell what he did with them.\r\n\r\n\"The river was dyed,\" he says, \"with the blood of the slaughtered for\r\ntwo hundred yards.  The approximate loss was upward of five hundred\r\nkilled, but few of the officers escaping.  My loss was about twenty\r\nkilled.  It is hoped that these facts will demonstrate to the Northern\r\npeople that negro soldiers cannot cope with Southerners.\"  Subsequently\r\nForrest made a report in which he left out the part which shocks\r\nhumanity to read.\r\n\r\nAt the East, also, the rebels were busy.  I had said to Halleck that\r\nPlymouth and Washington, North Carolina, were unnecessary to hold.  It\r\nwould be better to have the garrisons engaged there added to Butler's\r\ncommand.  If success attended our arms both places, and others too,\r\nwould fall into our hands naturally. These places had been occupied by\r\nFederal troops before I took command of the armies, and I knew that the\r\nExecutive would be reluctant to abandon them, and therefore explained my\r\nviews; but before my views were carried out the rebels captured the\r\ngarrison at Plymouth.  I then ordered the abandonment of Washington, but\r\ndirected the holding of New Berne at all hazards.  This was essential\r\nbecause New Berne was a port into which blockade runners could enter.\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks had gone on an expedition up the Red River long before my\r\npromotion to general command.  I had opposed the movement strenuously,\r\nbut acquiesced because it was the order of my superior at the time.  By\r\ndirection of Halleck I had reinforced Banks with a corps of about ten\r\nthousand men from Sherman's command.  This reinforcement was wanted back\r\nbadly before the forward movement commenced.  But Banks had got so far\r\nthat it seemed best that he should take Shreveport on the Red River, and\r\nturn over the line of that river to Steele, who commanded in Arkansas,\r\nto hold instead of the line of the Arkansas.  Orders were given\r\naccordingly, and with the expectation that the campaign would be ended\r\nin time for Banks to return A. J. Smith's command to where it belonged\r\nand get back to New Orleans himself in time to execute his part in the\r\ngeneral plan.  But the expedition was a failure.  Banks did not get back\r\nin time to take part in the programme as laid down. Nor was Smith\r\nreturned until long after the movements of May, 1864, had been begun.\r\nThe services of forty thousand veteran troops, over and above the number\r\nrequired to hold all that was necessary in the Department of the Gulf,\r\nwere thus paralyzed. It is but just to Banks, however, to say that his\r\nexpedition was ordered from Washington and he was in no way responsible\r\nexcept for the conduct of it.  I make no criticism on this point.  He\r\nopposed the expedition.\r\n\r\nBy the 27th of April spring had so far advanced as to justify me in\r\nfixing a day for the great move.  On that day Burnside left Annapolis to\r\noccupy Meade's position between Bull Run and the Rappahannock.  Meade\r\nwas notified and directed to bring his troops forward to his advance.\r\nOn the following day Butler was notified of my intended advance on the\r\n4th of May, and he was directed to move the night of the same day and\r\nget as far up the James River as possible by daylight, and push on from\r\nthere to accomplish the task given him.  He was also notified that\r\nreinforcements were being collected in Washington City, which would be\r\nforwarded to him should the enemy fall back into the trenches at\r\nRichmond.  The same day Sherman was directed to get his forces up ready\r\nto advance on the 5th.  Sigel was in Winchester and was notified to move\r\nin conjunction with the others.\r\n\r\nThe criticism has been made by writers on the campaign from the Rapidan\r\nto the James River that all the loss of life could have been obviated by\r\nmoving the army there on transports.  Richmond was fortified and\r\nintrenched so perfectly that one man inside to defend was more than\r\nequal to five outside besieging or assaulting.  To get possession of\r\nLee's army was the first great object.  With the capture of his army\r\nRichmond would necessarily follow.  It was better to fight him outside\r\nof his stronghold than in it.  If the Army of the Potomac had been moved\r\nbodily to the James River by water Lee could have moved a part of his\r\nforces back to Richmond, called Beauregard from the south to reinforce\r\nit, and with the balance moved on to Washington. Then, too, I ordered a\r\nmove, simultaneous with that of the Army of the Potomac, up the James\r\nRiver by a formidable army already collected at the mouth of the river.\r\n\r\nWhile my headquarters were at Culpeper, from the 26th of March to the\r\n4th of May, I generally visited Washington once a week to confer with\r\nthe Secretary of War and President.  On the last occasion, a few days\r\nbefore moving, a circumstance occurred which came near postponing my\r\npart in the campaign altogether. Colonel John S. Mosby had for a long\r\ntime been commanding a partisan corps, or regiment, which operated in\r\nthe rear of the Army of the Potomac.  On my return to the field on this\r\noccasion, as the train approached Warrenton Junction, a heavy cloud of\r\ndust was seen to the east of the road as if made by a body of cavalry on\r\na charge.  Arriving at the junction the train was stopped and inquiries\r\nmade as to the cause of the dust. There was but one man at the station,\r\nand he informed us that Mosby had crossed a few minutes before at full\r\nspeed in pursuit of Federal cavalry.  Had he seen our train coming, no\r\ndoubt he would have let his prisoners escape to capture the train.  I\r\nwas on a special train, if I remember correctly, without any guard.\r\n\r\nSince the close of the war I have come to know Colonel Mosby personally,\r\nand somewhat intimately.  He is a different man entirely from what I had\r\nsupposed.  He is slender, not tall, wiry, and looks as if he could\r\nendure any amount of physical exercise.  He is able, and thoroughly\r\nhonest and truthful. There were probably but few men in the South who\r\ncould have commanded successfully a separate detachment in the rear of\r\nan opposing army, and so near the border of hostilities, as long as he\r\ndid without losing his entire command.\r\n\r\nOn this same visit to Washington I had my last interview with the\r\nPresident before reaching the James River.  He had of course become\r\nacquainted with the fact that a general movement had been ordered all\r\nalong the line, and seemed to think it a new feature in war.  I\r\nexplained to him that it was necessary to have a great number of troops\r\nto guard and hold the territory we had captured, and to prevent\r\nincursions into the Northern States.  These troops could perform this\r\nservice just as well by advancing as by remaining still; and by\r\nadvancing they would compel the enemy to keep detachments to hold them\r\nback, or else lay his own territory open to invasion.  His answer was:\r\n\"Oh, yes!  I see that.  As we say out West, if a man can't skin he must\r\nhold a leg while somebody else does.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a certain incident connected with the Wilderness campaign of\r\nwhich it may not be out of place to speak; and to avoid a digression\r\nfurther on I will mention it here.\r\n\r\nA few days before my departure from Culpeper the Honorable E. B.\r\nWashburne visited me there, and remained with my headquarters for some\r\ndistance south, through the battle in the Wilderness and, I think, to\r\nSpottsylvania. He was accompanied by a Mr. Swinton, whom he presented as\r\na literary gentleman who wished to accompany the army with a view of\r\nwriting a history of the war when it was over.  He assured me--and I\r\nhave no doubt Swinton gave him the assurance--that he was not present as\r\na correspondent of the press.  I expressed an entire willingness to have\r\nhim (Swinton) accompany the army, and would have allowed him to do so as\r\na correspondent, restricted, however, in the character of the\r\ninformation he could give.  We received Richmond papers with about as\r\nmuch regularity as if there had been no war, and knew that our papers\r\nwere received with equal regularity by the Confederates.  It was\r\ndesirable, therefore, that correspondents should not be privileged spies\r\nof the enemy within our lines.\r\n\r\nProbably Mr. Swinton expected to be an invited guest at my headquarters,\r\nand was disappointed that he was not asked to become so.  At all events\r\nhe was not invited, and soon I found that he was corresponding with some\r\npaper (I have now forgotten which one), thus violating his word either\r\nexpressed or implied.  He knew of the assurance Washburne had given as\r\nto the character of his mission.  I never saw the man from the day of\r\nour introduction to the present that I recollect.  He accompanied us,\r\nhowever, for a time at least.\r\n\r\nThe second night after crossing the Rapidan (the night of the 5th of\r\nMay) Colonel W. R. Rowley, of my staff, was acting as night officer at\r\nmy headquarters.  A short time before midnight I gave him verbal\r\ninstructions for the night.  Three days later I read in a Richmond paper\r\na verbatim report of these instructions.\r\n\r\nA few nights still later (after the first, and possibly after the\r\nsecond, day's fighting in the Wilderness) General Meade came to my tent\r\nfor consultation, bringing with him some of his staff officers.  Both\r\nhis staff and mine retired to the camp-fire some yards in front of the\r\ntent, thinking our conversation should be private.  There was a stump a\r\nlittle to one side, and between the front of the tent and camp-fire.\r\nOne of my staff, Colonel T. S. Bowers, saw what he took to be a man\r\nseated on the ground and leaning against the stump, listening to the\r\nconversation between Meade and myself.  He called the attention of\r\nColonel Rowley to it.  The latter immediately took the man by the\r\nshoulder and asked him, in language more forcible than polite, what he\r\nwas doing there.  The man proved to be Swinton, the \"historian,\" and his\r\nreplies to the question were evasive and unsatisfactory, and he was\r\nwarned against further eaves-dropping.\r\n\r\nThe next I heard of Mr. Swinton was at Cold Harbor.  General Meade came\r\nto my headquarters saying that General Burnside had arrested Swinton,\r\nwho at some previous time had given great offence, and had ordered him\r\nto be shot that afternoon.  I promptly ordered the prisoner to be\r\nreleased, but that he must be expelled from the lines of the army not to\r\nreturn again on pain of punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nCOMMENCEMENT OF THE GRAND CAMPAIGN--GENERAL BUTLER'S POSITION\r\n--SHERIDAN'S FIRST RAID.\r\n\r\nThe armies were now all ready to move for the accomplishment of a single\r\nobject.  They were acting as a unit so far as such a thing was possible\r\nover such a vast field.  Lee, with the capital of the Confederacy, was\r\nthe main end to which all were working.  Johnston, with Atlanta, was an\r\nimportant obstacle in the way of our accomplishing the result aimed at,\r\nand was therefore almost an independent objective.  It was of less\r\nimportance only because the capture of Johnston and his army would not\r\nproduce so immediate and decisive a result in closing the rebellion as\r\nwould the possession of Richmond, Lee and his army.  All other troops\r\nwere employed exclusively in support of these two movements.  This was\r\nthe plan; and I will now endeavor to give, as concisely as I can, the\r\nmethod of its execution, outlining first the operations of minor\r\ndetached but co-operative columns.\r\n\r\nAs stated before, Banks failed to accomplish what he had been sent to do\r\non the Red River, and eliminated the use of forty thousand veterans\r\nwhose cooperation in the grand campaign had been expected--ten thousand\r\nwith Sherman and thirty thousand against Mobile.\r\n\r\nSigel's record is almost equally brief.  He moved out, it is true,\r\naccording to programme; but just when I was hoping to hear of good work\r\nbeing done in the valley I received instead the following announcement\r\nfrom Halleck:  \"Sigel is in full retreat on Strasburg.  He will do\r\nnothing but run; never did anything else.\"  The enemy had intercepted\r\nhim about New Market and handled him roughly, leaving him short six\r\nguns, and some nine hundred men out of his six thousand.\r\n\r\nThe plan had been for an advance of Sigel's forces in two columns.\r\nThough the one under his immediate command failed ingloriously the other\r\nproved more fortunate.  Under Crook and Averell his western column\r\nadvanced from the Gauley in West Virginia at the appointed time, and\r\nwith more happy results. They reached the Virginia and Tennessee\r\nRailroad at Dublin and destroyed a depot of supplies, besides tearing up\r\nseveral miles of road and burning the bridge over New River.  Having\r\naccomplished this they recrossed the Alleghanies to Meadow Bluffs and\r\nthere awaited further orders.\r\n\r\nButler embarked at Fort Monroe with all his command, except the cavalry\r\nand some artillery which moved up the south bank of the James River.\r\nHis steamers moved first up Chesapeake Bay and York River as if\r\nthreatening the rear of Lee's army.  At midnight they turned back, and\r\nButler by daylight was far up the James River.  He seized City Point and\r\nBermuda Hundred early in the day, without loss and, no doubt, very much\r\nto the surprise of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThis was the accomplishment of the first step contemplated in my\r\ninstructions to Butler.  He was to act from here, looking to Richmond as\r\nhis objective point.  I had given him to understand that I should aim to\r\nfight Lee between the Rapidan and Richmond if he would stand; but should\r\nLee fall back into Richmond I would follow up and make a junction of the\r\narmies of the Potomac and the James on the James River.  He was directed\r\nto secure a footing as far up the south side of the river as he could at\r\nas early a date as possible.\r\n\r\nButler was in position by the 6th of May and had begun intrenching, and\r\non the 7th he sent out his cavalry from Suffolk to cut the Weldon\r\nRailroad.  He also sent out detachments to destroy the railroad between\r\nPetersburg and Richmond, but no great success attended these latter\r\nefforts.  He made no great effort to establish himself on that road and\r\nneglected to attack Petersburg, which was almost defenceless.  About the\r\n11th he advanced slowly until he reached the works at Drury's Bluff,\r\nabout half way between Bermuda Hundred and Richmond.  In the mean time\r\nBeauregard had been gathering reinforcements.  On the 16th he attacked\r\nButler with great vigor, and with such success as to limit very\r\nmaterially the further usefulness of the Army of the James as a distinct\r\nfactor in the campaign.  I afterward ordered a portion of it to join the\r\nArmy of the Potomac, leaving a sufficient force with Butler to man his\r\nworks, hold securely the footing he had already gained and maintain a\r\nthreatening front toward the rear of the Confederate capital.\r\n\r\nThe position which General Butler had chosen between the two rivers, the\r\nJames and Appomattox, was one of great natural strength, one where a\r\nlarge area of ground might be thoroughly inclosed by means of a single\r\nintrenched line, and that a very short one in comparison with the extent\r\nof territory which it thoroughly protected.  His right was protected by\r\nthe James River, his left by the Appomattox, and his rear by their\r\njunction--the two streams uniting near by.  The bends of the two streams\r\nshortened the line that had been chosen for intrenchments, while it\r\nincreased the area which the line inclosed.\r\n\r\nPrevious to ordering any troops from Butler I sent my chief engineer,\r\nGeneral Barnard, from the Army of the Potomac to that of the James to\r\ninspect Butler's position and ascertain whether I could again safely\r\nmake an order for General Butler's movement in co-operation with mine,\r\nnow that I was getting so near Richmond; or, if I could not, whether his\r\nposition was strong enough to justify me in withdrawing some of his\r\ntroops and having them brought round by water to White House to join me\r\nand reinforce the Army of the Potomac.  General Barnard reported the\r\nposition very strong for defensive purposes, and that I could do the\r\nlatter with great security; but that General Butler could not move from\r\nwhere he was, in co-operation, to produce any effect. He said that the\r\ngeneral occupied a place between the James and Appomattox rivers which\r\nwas of great strength, and where with an inferior force he could hold it\r\nfor an indefinite length of time against a superior; but that he could\r\ndo nothing offensively.  I then asked him why Butler could not move out\r\nfrom his lines and push across the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad to\r\nthe rear and on the south side of Richmond.  He replied that it was\r\nimpracticable, because the enemy had substantially the same line across\r\nthe neck of land that General Butler had.  He then took out his pencil\r\nand drew a sketch of the locality, remarking that the position was like\r\na bottle and that Butler's line of intrenchments across the neck\r\nrepresented the cork; that the enemy had built an equally strong line\r\nimmediately in front of him across the neck; and it was therefore as if\r\nButler was in a bottle.  He was perfectly safe against an attack; but,\r\nas Barnard expressed it, the enemy had corked the bottle and with a\r\nsmall force could hold the cork in its place.  This struck me as being\r\nvery expressive of his position, particularly when I saw the hasty\r\nsketch which General Barnard had drawn; and in making my subsequent\r\nreport I used that expression without adding quotation marks, never\r\nthinking that anything had been said that would attract attention--as\r\nthis did, very much to the annoyance, no doubt, of General Butler and, I\r\nknow, very much to my own.  I found afterwards that this was mentioned\r\nin the notes of General Badeau's book, which, when they were shown to\r\nme, I asked to have stricken out; yet it was retained there, though\r\nagainst my wishes.\r\n\r\nI make this statement here because, although I have often made it\r\nbefore, it has never been in my power until now to place it where it\r\nwill correct history; and I desire to rectify all injustice that I may\r\nhave done to individuals, particularly to officers who were gallantly\r\nserving their country during the trying period of the war for the\r\npreservation of the Union. General Butler certainly gave his very\r\nearnest support to the war; and he gave his own best efforts personally\r\nto the suppression of the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe further operations of the Army of the James can best be treated of\r\nin connection with those of the Army of the Potomac, the two being so\r\nintimately associated and connected as to be substantially one body in\r\nwhich the individuality of the supporting wing is merged.\r\n\r\nBefore giving the reader a summary of Sherman's great Atlanta campaign,\r\nwhich must conclude my description of the various co-operative movements\r\npreparatory to proceeding with that of the operations of the centre, I\r\nwill briefly mention Sheridan's first raid upon Lee's communications\r\nwhich, though an incident of the operations on the main line and not\r\nspecifically marked out in the original plan, attained in its brilliant\r\nexecution and results all the proportions of an independent campaign.\r\nBy thus anticipating, in point of time, I will be able to more perfectly\r\nobserve the continuity of events occurring in my immediate front when I\r\nshall have undertaken to describe our advance from the Rapidan.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of May, just after the battle of the Wilderness and when we\r\nwere moving on Spottsylvania I directed Sheridan verbally to cut loose\r\nfrom the Army of the Potomac, pass around the left of Lee's army and\r\nattack his cavalry:  to cut the two roads--one running west through\r\nGordonsville, Charlottesville and Lynchburg, the other to Richmond, and,\r\nwhen compelled to do so for want of forage and rations, to move on to\r\nthe James River and draw these from Butler's supplies.  This move took\r\nhim past the entire rear of Lee's army.  These orders were also given in\r\nwriting through Meade.\r\n\r\nThe object of this move was three-fold.  First, if successfully\r\nexecuted, and it was, he would annoy the enemy by cutting his line of\r\nsupplies and telegraphic communications, and destroy or get for his own\r\nuse supplies in store in the rear and coming up.  Second, he would draw\r\nthe enemy's cavalry after him, and thus better protect our flanks, rear\r\nand trains than by remaining with the army.  Third, his absence would\r\nsave the trains drawing his forage and other supplies from\r\nFredericksburg, which had now become our base.  He started at daylight\r\nthe next morning, and accomplished more than was expected.  It was\r\nsixteen days before he got back to the Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nThe course Sheridan took was directly to Richmond.  Before night Stuart,\r\ncommanding the Confederate cavalry, came on to the rear of his command.\r\nBut the advance kept on, crossed the North Anna, and at Beaver Dam, a\r\nstation on the Virginia Central Railroad, recaptured four hundred Union\r\nprisoners on their way to Richmond, destroyed the road and used and\r\ndestroyed a large amount of subsistence and medical stores.\r\n\r\nStuart, seeing that our cavalry was pushing towards Richmond, abandoned\r\nthe pursuit on the morning of the 10th and, by a detour and an\r\nexhausting march, interposed between Sheridan and Richmond at Yellow\r\nTavern, only about six miles north of the city.  Sheridan destroyed the\r\nrailroad and more supplies at Ashland, and on the 11th arrived in\r\nStuart's front.  A severe engagement ensued in which the losses were\r\nheavy on both sides, but the rebels were beaten, their leader mortally\r\nwounded, and some guns and many prisoners were captured.\r\n\r\nSheridan passed through the outer defences of Richmond, and could, no\r\ndoubt, have passed through the inner ones.  But having no supports near\r\nhe could not have remained.  After caring for his wounded he struck for\r\nthe James River below the city, to communicate with Butler and to rest\r\nhis men and horses as well as to get food and forage for them.\r\n\r\nHe moved first between the Chickahominy and the James, but in the\r\nmorning (the 12th) he was stopped by batteries at Mechanicsville.  He\r\nthen turned to cross to the north side of the Chickahominy by Meadow\r\nBridge.  He found this barred, and the defeated Confederate cavalry,\r\nreorganized, occupying the opposite side.  The panic created by his\r\nfirst entrance within the outer works of Richmond having subsided troops\r\nwere sent out to attack his rear.\r\n\r\nHe was now in a perilous position, one from which but few generals could\r\nhave extricated themselves.  The defences of Richmond, manned, were to\r\nthe right, the Chickahominy was to the left with no bridge remaining and\r\nthe opposite bank guarded, to the rear was a force from Richmond.  This\r\nforce was attacked and beaten by Wilson's and Gregg's divisions, while\r\nSheridan turned to the left with the remaining division and hastily\r\nbuilt a bridge over the Chickahominy under the fire of the enemy, forced\r\na crossing and soon dispersed the Confederates he found there. The enemy\r\nwas held back from the stream by the fire of the troops not engaged in\r\nbridge building.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th Sheridan was at Bottom's Bridge, over the Chickahominy.  On\r\nthe 14th he crossed this stream and on that day went into camp on the\r\nJames River at Haxall's Landing.  He at once put himself into\r\ncommunication with General Butler, who directed all the supplies he\r\nwanted to be furnished.\r\n\r\nSheridan had left the Army of the Potomac at Spottsylvania, but did not\r\nknow where either this or Lee's army was now.  Great caution therefore\r\nhad to be exercised in getting back.  On the 17th, after resting his\r\ncommand for three days, he started on his return.  He moved by the way\r\nof White House.  The bridge over the Pamunkey had been burned by the\r\nenemy, but a new one was speedily improvised and the cavalry crossed\r\nover it.  On the 22d he was at Aylett's on the Matapony, where he\r\nlearned the position of the two armies.  On the 24th he joined us on the\r\nmarch from North Anna to Cold Harbor, in the vicinity of Chesterfield.\r\n\r\nSheridan in this memorable raid passed entirely around Lee's army:\r\nencountered his cavalry in four engagements, and defeated them in all;\r\nrecaptured four hundred Union prisoners and killed and captured many of\r\nthe enemy; destroyed and used many supplies and munitions of war;\r\ndestroyed miles of railroad and telegraph, and freed us from annoyance\r\nby the cavalry of the enemy for more than two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nSHERMAN'S CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA--SIEGE OF ATLANTA--DEATH OF GENERAL\r\nMCPHERSON--ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE ANDERSONVILLE--CAPTURE OF ATLANTA.\r\n\r\nAfter separating from Sherman in Cincinnati I went on to Washington, as\r\nalready stated, while he returned to Nashville to assume the duties of\r\nhis new command.  His military division was now composed of four\r\ndepartments and embraced all the territory west of the Alleghany\r\nMountains and east of the Mississippi River, together with the State of\r\nArkansas in the trans-Mississippi.  The most easterly of these was the\r\nDepartment of the Ohio, General Schofield commanding; the next was the\r\nDepartment of the Cumberland, General Thomas commanding; the third the\r\nDepartment of the Tennessee, General McPherson commanding; and General\r\nSteele still commanded the trans-Mississippi, or Department of Arkansas.\r\nThe last-named department was so far away that Sherman could not\r\ncommunicate with it very readily after starting on his spring campaign,\r\nand it was therefore soon transferred from his military division to that\r\nof the Gulf, where General Canby, who had relieved General Banks, was in\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the armies, as I have stated in a former chapter, were\r\nto be simultaneous, I fixing the day to start when the season should be\r\nfar enough advanced, it was hoped, for the roads to be in a condition\r\nfor the troops to march.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman at once set himself to work preparing for the task which\r\nwas assigned him to accomplish in the spring campaign.  McPherson lay at\r\nHuntsville with about twenty-four thousand men, guarding those points of\r\nTennessee which were regarded as most worth holding; Thomas, with over\r\nsixty thousand men of the Army of the Cumberland, was at Chattanooga;\r\nand Schofield, with about fourteen thousand men, was at Knoxville. With\r\nthese three armies, numbering about one hundred thousand men in all,\r\nSherman was to move on the day fixed for the general advance, with a\r\nview of destroying Johnston's army and capturing Atlanta. He visited\r\neach of these commands to inform himself as to their condition, and it\r\nwas found to be, speaking generally, good.\r\n\r\nOne of the first matters to turn his attention to was that of getting,\r\nbefore the time arrived for starting, an accumulation of supplies\r\nforward to Chattanooga, sufficiently large to warrant a movement.  He\r\nfound, when he got to that place, that the trains over the single-track\r\nrailroad, which was frequently interrupted for a day or two at a time,\r\nwere only sufficient to meet the daily wants of the troops without\r\nbringing forward any surplus of any kind.  He found, however, that\r\ntrains were being used to transport all the beef cattle, horses for the\r\ncavalry, and even teams that were being brought to the front.  He at\r\nonce changed all this, and required beef cattle, teams, cavalry horses,\r\nand everything that could travel, even the troops, to be marched, and\r\nused the road exclusively for transporting supplies.  In this way he was\r\nable to accumulate an abundance before the time finally fixed upon for\r\nthe move, the 4th of May.\r\n\r\nAs I have said already, Johnston was at Dalton, which was nearly\r\none-fourth of the way between Chattanooga and Atlanta. The country is\r\nmountainous all the way to Atlanta, abounding in mountain streams, some\r\nof them of considerable volume.  Dalton is on ground where water drains\r\ntowards Atlanta and into one of the main streams rising north-east from\r\nthere and flowing south-west--this being the general direction which all\r\nthe main streams of that section take, with smaller tributaries entering\r\ninto them.  Johnston had been preparing himself for this campaign during\r\nthe entire winter.  The best positions for defence had been selected all\r\nthe way from Dalton back to Atlanta, and very strongly intrenched; so\r\nthat, as he might be forced to fall back from one position, he would\r\nhave another to fall into in his rear.  His position at Dalton was so\r\nvery strongly intrenched that no doubt he expected, or at least hoped,\r\nto hold Sherman there and prevent him from getting any further.  With a\r\nless skilful general, and one disposed to take no risks, I have no doubt\r\nthat he would have succeeded.\r\n\r\nSherman's plan was to start Schofield, who was farthest back, a few days\r\nin advance from Knoxville, having him move on the direct road to Dalton.\r\nThomas was to move out to Ringgold.  It had been Sherman's intention to\r\ncross McPherson over the Tennessee River at Huntsville or Decatur, and\r\nmove him south from there so as to have him come into the road running\r\nfrom Chattanooga to Atlanta a good distance to the rear of the point\r\nJohnston was occupying; but when that was contemplated it was hoped that\r\nMcPherson alone would have troops enough to cope with Johnston, if the\r\nlatter should move against him while unsupported by the balance of the\r\narmy.  In this he was disappointed.  Two of McPherson's veteran\r\ndivisions had re-enlisted on the express provision that they were to\r\nhave a furlough.  This furlough had not yet expired, and they were not\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThen, again, Sherman had lent Banks two divisions under A. J. Smith, the\r\nwinter before, to co-operate with the trans-Mississippi forces, and this\r\nwith the express pledge that they should be back by a time specified, so\r\nas to be prepared for this very campaign.  It is hardly necessary to say\r\nthey were not returned.  That department continued to absorb troops to\r\nno purpose to the end of the war.  This left McPherson so weak that the\r\npart of the plan above indicated had to be changed.  He was therefore\r\nbrought up to Chattanooga and moved from there on a road to the right of\r\nThomas--the two coming together about Dalton.  The three armies were\r\nabreast, all ready to start promptly on time.\r\n\r\nSherman soon found that Dalton was so strongly fortified that it was\r\nuseless to make any attempt to carry it by assault; and even to carry it\r\nby regular approaches was impracticable.  There was a narrowing up in\r\nthe mountain, between the National and Confederate armies, through which\r\na stream, a wagon road and a railroad ran.  Besides, the stream had been\r\ndammed so that the valley was a lake.  Through this gorge the troops\r\nwould have to pass.  McPherson was therefore sent around by the right,\r\nto come out by the way of Snake Creek Gap into the rear of the enemy.\r\nThis was a surprise to Johnston, and about the 13th he decided to\r\nabandon his position at Dalton.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th there was very hard fighting about Resaca; but our cavalry\r\nhaving been sent around to the right got near the road in the enemy's\r\nrear.  Again Johnston fell back, our army pursuing.  The pursuit was\r\ncontinued to Kingston, which was reached on the 19th with very little\r\nfighting, except that Newton's division overtook the rear of Johnston's\r\narmy and engaged it.  Sherman was now obliged to halt for the purpose of\r\nbringing up his railroad trains.  He was depending upon the railroad for\r\nall of his supplies, and as of course the railroad was wholly destroyed\r\nas Johnston fell back, it had to be rebuilt.  This work was pushed\r\nforward night and day, and caused much less delay than most persons\r\nwould naturally expect in a mountainous country where there were so many\r\nbridges to be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nThe campaign to Atlanta was managed with the most consummate skill, the\r\nenemy being flanked out of one position after another all the way there.\r\nIt is true this was not accomplished without a good deal of fighting\r\n--some of it very hard fighting, rising to the dignity of very important\r\nbattles--neither were single positions gained in a day.  On the\r\ncontrary, weeks were spent at some; and about Atlanta more than a month\r\nwas consumed.\r\n\r\nIt was the 23d of May before the road was finished up to the rear of\r\nSherman's army and the pursuit renewed.  This pursuit brought him up to\r\nthe vicinity of Allatoona. This place was very strongly intrenched, and\r\nnaturally a very defensible position. An assault upon it was not thought\r\nof, but preparations were made to flank the enemy out of it.  This was\r\ndone by sending a large force around our right, by the way of Dallas, to\r\nreach the rear of the enemy.  Before reaching there, however, they found\r\nthe enemy fortified in their way, and there resulted hard fighting for\r\nabout a week at a place called New Hope Church.  On the left our troops\r\nalso were fortified, and as close up to the enemy as they could get.\r\nThey kept working still farther around to the left toward the railroad.\r\nThis was the case more particularly with the cavalry.  By the 4th of\r\nJune Johnston found that he was being hemmed in so rapidly that he drew\r\noff and Allatoona was left in our possession.\r\n\r\nAllatoona, being an important place, was strongly intrenched for\r\noccupation by our troops before advancing farther, and made a secondary\r\nbase of supplies.  The railroad was finished up to that point, the\r\nintrenchments completed, storehouses provided for food, and the army got\r\nin readiness for a further advance. The rains, however, were falling in\r\nsuch torrents that it was impossible to move the army by the side roads\r\nwhich they would have to move upon in order to turn Johnston out of his\r\nnew position.\r\n\r\nWhile Sherman's army lay here, General F. P. Blair returned to it,\r\nbringing with him the two divisions of veterans who had been on\r\nfurlough.\r\n\r\nJohnston had fallen back to Marietta and Kenesaw Mountain, where strong\r\nintrenchments awaited him.  At this latter place our troops made an\r\nassault upon the enemy's lines after having got their own lines up close\r\nto him, and failed, sustaining considerable loss.  But during the\r\nprogress of the battle Schofield was gaining ground to the left; and the\r\ncavalry on his left were gaining still more toward the enemy's rear.\r\nThese operations were completed by the 3d of July, when it was found\r\nthat Johnston had evacuated the place.  He was pursued at once.  Sherman\r\nhad made every preparation to abandon the railroad, leaving a strong\r\nguard in his intrenchments.  He had intended, moving out with twenty\r\ndays' rations and plenty of ammunition, to come in on the railroad again\r\nat the Chattahoochee River.  Johnston frustrated this plan by himself\r\nstarting back as above stated.  This time he fell back to the\r\nChattahoochee.\r\n\r\nAbout the 5th of July he was besieged again, Sherman getting easy\r\npossession of the Chattahoochee River both above and below him.  The\r\nenemy was again flanked out of his position, or so frightened by\r\nflanking movements that on the night of the 9th he fell back across the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nHere Johnston made a stand until the 17th, when Sherman's old tactics\r\nprevailed again and the final movement toward Atlanta began.  Johnston\r\nwas now relieved of the command, and Hood superseded him.\r\n\r\nJohnston's tactics in this campaign do not seem to have met with much\r\nfavor, either in the eyes of the administration at Richmond, or of the\r\npeople of that section of the South in which he was commanding.  The\r\nvery fact of a change of commanders being ordered under such\r\ncircumstances was an indication of a change of policy, and that now they\r\nwould become the aggressors--the very thing our troops wanted.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I think that Johnston's tactics were right. Anything\r\nthat could have prolonged the war a year beyond the time that it did\r\nfinally close, would probably have exhausted the North to such an extent\r\nthat they might then have abandoned the contest and agreed to a\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\nAtlanta was very strongly intrenched all the way around in a circle\r\nabout a mile and a half outside of the city.  In addition to this, there\r\nwere advanced intrenchments which had to be taken before a close siege\r\ncould be commenced.\r\n\r\nSure enough, as indicated by the change of commanders, the enemy was\r\nabout to assume the offensive.  On the 20th he came out and attacked the\r\nArmy of the Cumberland most furiously.  Hooker's corps, and Newton's and\r\nJohnson's divisions were the principal ones engaged in this contest,\r\nwhich lasted more than an hour; but the Confederates were then forced to\r\nfall back inside their main lines.  The losses were quite heavy on both\r\nsides.  On this day General Gresham, since our Postmaster-General, was\r\nvery badly wounded.  During the night Hood abandoned his outer lines,\r\nand our troops were advanced.  The investment had not been relinquished\r\nfor a moment during the day.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 21st Hood moved out again, passing by our left\r\nflank, which was then in motion to get a position farther in rear of\r\nhim, and a desperate battle ensued, which lasted most of the day of the\r\n22d.  At first the battle went very much in favor of the Confederates,\r\nour troops being somewhat surprised.  While our troops were advancing\r\nthey were struck in flank, and their flank was enveloped.  But they had\r\nbecome too thorough veterans to be thrown into irreparable confusion by\r\nan unexpected attack when off their guard, and soon they were in order\r\nand engaging the enemy, with the advantage now of knowing where their\r\nantagonist was.  The field of battle continued to expand until it\r\nembraced about seven miles of ground.  Finally, however, and before\r\nnight, the enemy was driven back into the city (*26).\r\n\r\nIt was during this battle that McPherson, while passing from one column\r\nto another, was instantly killed.  In his death the army lost one of its\r\nablest, purest and best generals.\r\n\r\nGarrard had been sent out with his cavalry to get upon the railroad east\r\nof Atlanta and to cut it in the direction of Augusta. He was successful\r\nin this, and returned about the time of the battle.  Rousseau had also\r\ncome up from Tennessee with a small division of cavalry, having crossed\r\nthe Tennessee River about Decatur and made a raid into Alabama. Finally,\r\nwhen hard pressed, he had come in, striking the railroad in rear of\r\nSherman, and reported to him about this time.\r\n\r\nThe battle of the 22d is usually known as the Battle of Atlanta,\r\nalthough the city did not fall into our hands until the 2d of September.\r\nPreparations went on, as before, to flank the enemy out of his position.\r\nThe work was tedious, and the lines that had to be maintained were very\r\nlong.  Our troops were gradually worked around to the east until they\r\nstruck the road between Decatur and Atlanta. These lines were strongly\r\nfortified, as were those to the north and west of the city--all as close\r\nup to the enemy's lines as practicable--in order to hold them with the\r\nsmallest possible number of men, the design being to detach an army to\r\nmove by our right and try to get upon the railroad down south of\r\nAtlanta.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th the movement by the right flank commenced.  On the 28th the\r\nenemy struck our right flank, General Logan commanding, with great\r\nvigor.  Logan intrenched himself hastily, and by that means was enabled\r\nto resist all assaults and inflict a great deal of damage upon the\r\nenemy.  These assaults were continued to the middle of the afternoon,\r\nand resumed once or twice still later in the day.  The enemy's losses in\r\nthese unsuccessful assaults were fearful.\r\n\r\nDuring that evening the enemy in Logan's front withdrew into the town.\r\nThis now left Sherman's army close up to the Confederate lines,\r\nextending from a point directly east of the city around by the north and\r\nwest of it for a distance of fully ten miles; the whole of this line\r\nbeing intrenched, and made stronger every day they remained there.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of July Sherman sent Stoneman to destroy the\r\nrailroads to the south, about Macon.  He was then to go east and, if\r\npossible, release our prisoners about Andersonville. There were painful\r\nstories current at the time about the great hardships these prisoners\r\nhad to endure in the way of general bad treatment, in the way in which\r\nthey were housed, and in the way in which they were fed.  Great sympathy\r\nwas felt for them; and it was thought that even if they could be turned\r\nloose upon the country it would be a great relief to them.  But the\r\nattempt proved a failure.  McCook, who commanded a small brigade, was\r\nfirst reported to have been captured; but he got back, having inflicted\r\na good deal of damage upon the enemy.  He had also taken some prisoners;\r\nbut encountering afterwards a largely superior force of the enemy he was\r\nobliged to drop his prisoners and get back as best he could with what\r\nmen he had left.  He had lost several hundred men out of his small\r\ncommand.  On the 4th of August Colonel Adams, commanding a little\r\nbrigade of about a thousand men, returned reporting Stoneman and all but\r\nhimself as lost.  I myself had heard around Richmond of the capture of\r\nStoneman, and had sent Sherman word, which he received.  The rumor was\r\nconfirmed there, also, from other sources.  A few days after Colonel\r\nAdams's return Colonel Capron also got in with a small detachment and\r\nconfirmed the report of the capture of Stoneman with something less than\r\na thousand men.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Stoneman, finding the escape of all his force was\r\nimpossible, had made arrangements for the escape of two divisions.  He\r\ncovered the movement of these divisions to the rear with a force of\r\nabout seven hundred men, and at length surrendered himself and this\r\ndetachment to the commanding Confederate.  In this raid, however, much\r\ndamage was inflicted upon the enemy by the destruction of cars,\r\nlocomotives, army wagons, manufactories of military supplies, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th and 5th Sherman endeavored to get upon the railroad to our\r\nright, where Schofield was in command, but these attempts failed\r\nutterly.  General Palmer was charged with being the cause of this\r\nfailure, to a great extent, by both General Sherman and General\r\nSchofield; but I am not prepared to say this, although a question seems\r\nto have arisen with Palmer as to whether Schofield had any right to\r\ncommand him.  If he did raise this question while an action was going\r\non, that act alone was exceedingly reprehensible.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Wheeler got upon our railroad north of Resaca and\r\ndestroyed it nearly up to Dalton.  This cut Sherman off from\r\ncommunication with the North for several days.  Sherman responded to\r\nthis attack on his lines of communication by directing one upon theirs.\r\n\r\nKilpatrick started on the night of the 18th of August to reach the Macon\r\nroad about Jonesboro.  He succeeded in doing so, passed entirely around\r\nthe Confederate lines of Atlanta, and was back again in his former\r\nposition on our left by the 22d.  These little affairs, however,\r\ncontributed but very little to the grand result.  They annoyed, it is\r\ntrue, but any damage thus done to a railroad by any cavalry expedition\r\nis soon repaired.\r\n\r\nSherman made preparations for a repetition of his tactics; that is, for\r\na flank movement with as large a force as could be got together to some\r\npoint in the enemy's rear.  Sherman commenced this last movement on the\r\n25th of August, and on the 1st of September was well up towards the\r\nrailroad twenty miles south of Atlanta.  Here he found Hardee\r\nintrenched, ready to meet him.  A battle ensued, but he was unable to\r\ndrive Hardee away before night set in.  Under cover of the night,\r\nhowever, Hardee left of his own accord.  That night Hood blew up his\r\nmilitary works, such as he thought would be valuable in our hands, and\r\ndecamped.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at daylight General H. W. Slocum, who was commanding\r\nnorth of the city, moved in and took possession of Atlanta, and notified\r\nSherman.  Sherman then moved deliberately back, taking three days to\r\nreach the city, and occupied a line extending from Decatur on the left\r\nto Atlanta in the centre, with his troops extending out of the city for\r\nsome distance to the right.\r\n\r\nThe campaign had lasted about four months, and was one of the most\r\nmemorable in history.  There was but little if anything in the whole\r\ncampaign, now that it is over, to criticise at all, and nothing to\r\ncriticise severely.  It was creditable alike to the general who\r\ncommanded and the army which had executed it. Sherman had on this\r\ncampaign some bright, wide-awake division and brigade commanders whose\r\nalertness added a host to the efficiency of his command.\r\n\r\nThe troops now went to work to make themselves comfortable, and to enjoy\r\na little rest after their arduous campaign.  The city of Atlanta was\r\nturned into a military base.  The citizens were all compelled to leave.\r\nSherman also very wisely prohibited the assembling of the army of\r\nsutlers and traders who always follow in the wake of an army in the\r\nfield, if permitted to do so, from trading with the citizens and getting\r\nthe money of the soldiers for articles of but little use to them, and\r\nfor which they are made to pay most exorbitant prices.  He limited the\r\nnumber of these traders to one for each of his three armies.\r\n\r\nThe news of Sherman's success reached the North instantaneously, and set\r\nthe country all aglow.  This was the first great political campaign for\r\nthe Republicans in their canvass of 1864.  It was followed later by\r\nSheridan's campaign in the Shenandoah Valley; and these two campaigns\r\nprobably had more effect in settling the election of the following\r\nNovember than all the speeches, all the bonfires, and all the parading\r\nwith banners and bands of music in the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nGRAND MOVEMENT OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC--CROSSING THE RAPIDAN\r\n--ENTERING THE WILDERNESS--BATTLE OF THE WILDERNESS.\r\n\r\nSoon after midnight, May 3d-4th, the Army of the Potomac moved out from\r\nits position north Rapidan, to start upon that memorable campaign,\r\ndestined to result in the capture of the Confederate capital and the\r\narmy defending it.  This was not to be accomplished, however, without as\r\ndesperate fighting as the world has ever witnessed; not to be\r\nconsummated in a day, a week, a month, single season.  The losses\r\ninflicted, and endured, were destined to be severe; but the armies now\r\nconfronting each other had already been in deadly conflict for a period\r\nof three years, with immense losses in killed, by death from sickness,\r\ncaptured and wounded; and neither had made any real progress\r\naccomplishing the final end.  It is true the Confederates had, so far,\r\nheld their capital, and they claimed this to be their sole object.  But\r\npreviously they had boldly proclaimed their intention to capture\r\nPhiladelphia, New York, and the National Capital, and had made several\r\nattempts to do so, and once or twice had come fearfully near making\r\ntheir boast good--too near for complacent contemplation by the loyal\r\nNorth. They had also come near losing their own capital on at least one\r\noccasion.  So here was a stand-off.  The campaign now begun was destined\r\nto result in heavier losses, to both armies, in a given time, than any\r\npreviously suffered; but the carnage was to be limited to a single year,\r\nand to accomplish all that had been anticipated or desired at the\r\nbeginning in that time.  We had to have hard fighting to achieve this.\r\nThe two armies had been confronting each other so long, without any\r\ndecisive result, that they hardly knew which could whip.\r\n\r\nTen days' rations, with a supply of forage and ammunition were taken in\r\nwagons.  Beef cattle were driven with the trains, and butchered as\r\nwanted.  Three days rations in addition, in haversacks, and fifty rounds\r\nof cartridges, were carried on the person of each soldier.\r\n\r\nThe country over which the army had to operate, from the Rapidan to the\r\ncrossing of the James River, is rather flat, and is cut by numerous\r\nstreams which make their way to the Chesapeake Bay.  The crossings of\r\nthese streams by the army were generally made not far above tide-water,\r\nand where they formed a considerable obstacle to the rapid advance of\r\ntroops even when the enemy did not appear in opposition.  The country\r\nroads were narrow and poor. Most of the country is covered with a dense\r\nforest, in places, like the Wilderness and along the Chickahominy,\r\nalmost impenetrable even for infantry except along the roads.  All\r\nbridges were naturally destroyed before the National troops came to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Potomac was composed of three infantry and one cavalry\r\ncorps, commanded respectively by Generals W. S. Hancock, G. K. Warren,\r\n(*27) John Sedgwick and P. H. Sheridan.  The artillery was commanded by\r\nGeneral Henry J. Hunt.  This arm was in such abundance that the fourth\r\nof it could not be used to advantage in such a country as we were\r\ndestined to pass through.  The surplus was much in the way, taking up as\r\nit did so much of the narrow and bad roads, and consuming so much of the\r\nforage and other stores brought up by the trains.\r\n\r\nThe 5th corps, General Warren commanding, was in advance on the right,\r\nand marched directly for Germania Ford, preceded by one division of\r\ncavalry, under General J. H. Wilson.  General Sedgwick followed Warren\r\nwith the 6th corps.  Germania Ford was nine or ten miles below the right\r\nof Lee's line.  Hancock, with the 2d corps, moved by another road,\r\nfarther east, directly upon Ely's Ford, six miles below Germania,\r\npreceded by Gregg's division of cavalry, and followed by the artillery.\r\nTorbert's division of cavalry was left north of the Rapidan, for the\r\ntime, to picket the river and prevent the enemy from crossing and\r\ngetting into our rear.  The cavalry seized the two crossings before\r\ndaylight, drove the enemy's pickets guarding them away, and by six\r\no'clock A.M. had the pontoons laid ready for the crossing of the\r\ninfantry and artillery.  This was undoubtedly a surprise to Lee.  The\r\nfact that the movement was unopposed proves this.\r\n\r\nBurnside, with the 9th corps, was left back at Warrenton, guarding the\r\nrailroad from Bull Run forward to preserve control of it in case our\r\ncrossing the Rapidan should be long delayed. He was instructed, however,\r\nto advance at once on receiving notice that the army had crossed; and a\r\ndispatch was sent to him a little after one P.M. giving the information\r\nthat our crossing had been successful.\r\n\r\nThe country was heavily wooded at all the points of crossing,\r\nparticularly on the south side of the river.  The battle-field from the\r\ncrossing of the Rapidan until the final movement from the Wilderness\r\ntoward Spottsylvania was of the same character. There were some\r\nclearings and small farms within what might be termed the battle-field;\r\nbut generally the country was covered with a dense forest.  The roads\r\nwere narrow and bad.  All the conditions were favorable for defensive\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThere are two roads, good for that part of Virginia, running from Orange\r\nCourt House to the battle-field.  The most southerly of these roads is\r\nknown as the Orange Court House Plank Road, the northern one as the\r\nOrange Turnpike.  There are also roads from east of the battle-field\r\nrunning to Spottsylvania Court House, one from Chancellorsville,\r\nbranching at Aldrich's; the western branch going by Piney Branch Church,\r\nAlsop's, thence by the Brock Road to Spottsylvania; the east branch goes\r\nby Gates's, thence to Spottsylvania.  The Brock Road runs from Germania\r\nFord through the battle-field and on to the Court House.  As\r\nSpottsylvania is approached the country is cut up with numerous roads,\r\nsome going to the town direct, and others crossing so as to connect the\r\nfarms with roads going there.\r\n\r\nLee's headquarters were at Orange Court House.  From there to\r\nFredericksburg he had the use of the two roads above described running\r\nnearly parallel to the Wilderness.  This gave him unusual facilities,\r\nfor that country, for concentrating his forces to his right.  These\r\nroads strike the road from Germania Ford in the Wilderness.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the crossing of the infantry was assured, the cavalry pushed\r\nforward, Wilson's division by Wilderness Tavern to Parker's store, on\r\nthe Orange Plank Road; Gregg to the left towards Chancellorsville.\r\nWarren followed Wilson and reached the Wilderness Tavern by noon, took\r\nposition there and intrenched.  Sedgwick followed Warren.  He was across\r\nthe river and in camp on the south bank, on the right of Warren, by\r\nsundown.  Hancock, with the 2d corps, moved parallel with Warren and\r\ncamped about six miles east of him.  Before night all the troops, and by\r\nthe evening of the 5th the trains of more than four thousand wagons,\r\nwere safely on the south side of the river.\r\n\r\nThere never was a corps better organized than was the quartermaster's\r\ncorps with the Army of the Potomac in 1864. With a wagon-train that\r\nwould have extended from the Rapidan to Richmond, stretched along in\r\nsingle file and separated as the teams necessarily would be when moving,\r\nwe could still carry only three days' forage and about ten to twelve\r\ndays' rations, besides a supply of ammunition.  To overcome all\r\ndifficulties, the chief quartermaster, General Rufus Ingalls, had marked\r\non each wagon the corps badge with the division color and the number of\r\nthe brigade.  At a glance, the particular brigade to which any wagon\r\nbelonged could be told.  The wagons were also marked to note the\r\ncontents:  if ammunition, whether for artillery or infantry; if forage,\r\nwhether grain or hay; if rations, whether, bread, pork, beans, rice,\r\nsugar, coffee or whatever it might be.  Empty wagons were never allowed\r\nto follow the army or stay in camp.  As soon as a wagon was empty it\r\nwould return to the base of supply for a load of precisely the same\r\narticle that had been taken from it.  Empty trains were obliged to leave\r\nthe road free for loaded ones.  Arriving near the army they would be\r\nparked in fields nearest to the brigades they belonged to.  Issues,\r\nexcept of ammunition, were made at night in all cases.  By this system\r\nthe hauling of forage for the supply train was almost wholly dispensed\r\nwith.  They consumed theirs at the depots.\r\n\r\nI left Culpeper Court House after all the troops had been put in motion,\r\nand passing rapidly to the front, crossed the Rapidan in advance of\r\nSedgwick's corps; and established headquarters for the afternoon and\r\nnight in a deserted house near the river.\r\n\r\nOrders had been given, long before this movement began, to cut down the\r\nbaggage of officers and men to the lowest point possible.\r\nNotwithstanding this I saw scattered along the road from Culpeper to\r\nGermania Ford wagon-loads of new blankets and overcoats, thrown away by\r\nthe troops to lighten their knapsacks; an improvidence I had never\r\nwitnessed before.\r\n\r\nLee, while his pickets and signal corps must have discovered at a very\r\nearly hour on the morning of the 4th of May, that the Army of the\r\nPotomac was moving, evidently did not learn until about one o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon by what route we would confront his army.  This I judge\r\nfrom the fact that at 1.15 P.M., an hour and a quarter after Warren had\r\nreached Old Wilderness Tavern, our officers took off rebel signals\r\nwhich, when translated, were seen to be an order to his troops to occupy\r\ntheir intrenchments at Mine Run.\r\n\r\nHere at night dispatches were received announcing that Sherman, Butler\r\nand Crook had moved according to programme.\r\n\r\nOn discovering the advance of the Army of the Potomac, Lee ordered Hill,\r\nEwell and Longstreet, each commanding corps, to move to the right to\r\nattack us, Hill on the Orange Plank Road, Longstreet to follow on the\r\nsame road.  Longstreet was at this time--middle of the afternoon--at\r\nGordonsville, twenty or more miles away.  Ewell was ordered by the\r\nOrange Pike.  He was near by and arrived some four miles east of Mine\r\nRun before bivouacking for the night.\r\n\r\nMy orders were given through General Meade for an early advance on the\r\nmorning of the 5th.  Warren was to move to Parker's store, and Wilson's\r\ncavalry--then at Parker's store--to move on to Craig's meeting-house.\r\nSedgwick followed Warren, closing in on his right.  The Army of the\r\nPotomac was facing to the west, though our advance was made to the\r\nsouth, except when facing the enemy.  Hancock was to move south-westward\r\nto join on the left of Warren, his left to reach to Shady Grove Church.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock, before reaching Parker's store, Warren discovered the\r\nenemy.  He sent word back to this effect, and was ordered to halt and\r\nprepare to meet and attack him.  Wright, with his division of Sedgwick's\r\ncorps, was ordered, by any road he could find, to join on to Warren's\r\nright, and Getty with his division, also of Sedgwick's corps, was\r\nordered to move rapidly by Warren's rear and get on his left.  This was\r\nthe speediest way to reinforce Warren who was confronting the enemy on\r\nboth the Orange plank and turnpike roads.\r\n\r\nBurnside had moved promptly on the 4th, on receiving word that the Army\r\nof the Potomac had safely crossed the Rapidan.  By making a night march,\r\nalthough some of his troops had to march forty miles to reach the river,\r\nhe was crossing with the head of his column early on the morning of the\r\n5th.  Meade moved his headquarters on to Old Wilderness Tavern, four\r\nmiles south of the river, as soon as it was light enough to see the\r\nroad.  I remained to hasten Burnside's crossing and to put him in\r\nposition.  Burnside at this time was not under Meade's command, and was\r\nhis senior in rank.  Getting information of the proximity of the enemy,\r\nI informed Meade, and without waiting to see Burnside, at once moved\r\nforward my headquarters to where Meade was.\r\n\r\nIt was my plan then, as it was on all other occasions, to take the\r\ninitiative whenever the enemy could be drawn from his intrenchments if\r\nwe were not intrenched ourselves.  Warren had not yet reached the point\r\nwhere he was to halt, when he discovered the enemy near by.  Neither\r\nparty had any advantage of position.  Warren was, therefore, ordered to\r\nattack as soon as he could prepare for it.  At nine o'clock Hancock was\r\nordered to come up to the support of Getty.  He himself arrived at\r\nGetty's front about noon, but his troops were yet far in the rear.\r\nGetty was directed to hold his position at all hazards until relieved.\r\nAbout this hour Warren was ready, and attacked with favorable though not\r\ndecisive results.  Getty was somewhat isolated from Warren and was in a\r\nprecarious condition for a time.  Wilson, with his division of cavalry,\r\nwas farther south, and was cut off from the rest of the army.  At two\r\no'clock Hancock's troops began to arrive, and immediately he was ordered\r\nto join Getty and attack the enemy.  But the heavy timber and narrow\r\nroads prevented him from getting into position for attack as promptly as\r\nhe generally did when receiving such orders.  At four o'clock he again\r\nreceived his orders to attack, and General Getty received orders from\r\nMeade a few minutes later to attack whether Hancock was ready or not.\r\nHe met the enemy under Heth within a few hundred yards.\r\n\r\nHancock immediately sent two divisions, commanded by Birney and Mott,\r\nand later two brigades, Carroll's and Owen's, to the support of Getty.\r\nThis was timely and saved Getty.  During the battle Getty and Carroll\r\nwere wounded, but remained on the field.  One of Birney's most gallant\r\nbrigade commanders--Alexander Hays--was killed.\r\n\r\nI had been at West Point with Hays for three years, and had served with\r\nhim through the Mexican war, a portion of the time in the same regiment.\r\nHe was a most gallant officer, ready to lead his command wherever\r\nordered.  With him it was \"Come, boys,\" not \"Go.\"\r\n\r\nWadsworth's division and Baxter's brigade of the 2d division were sent\r\nto reinforce Hancock and Getty; but the density of the intervening\r\nforest was such that, there being no road to march upon, they did not\r\nget up with the head of column until night, and bivouacked where they\r\nwere without getting into position.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon Sheridan sent Gregg's division of cavalry to Todd's\r\nTavern in search of Wilson.  This was fortunate.  He found Wilson\r\nengaged with a superior force under General Rosser, supported by\r\ninfantry, and falling back before it.  Together they were strong enough\r\nto turn the tables upon the enemy and themselves become aggressive.\r\nThey soon drove the rebel cavalry back beyond Corbin's Bridge.\r\n\r\nFighting between Hancock and Hill continued until night put a close to\r\nit.  Neither side made any special progress.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the battle of the 5th of May my orders were given for\r\nthe following morning.  We knew Longstreet with 12,000 men was on his\r\nway to join Hill's right, near the Brock Road, and might arrive during\r\nthe night.  I was anxious that the rebels should not take the initiative\r\nin the morning, and therefore ordered Hancock to make an assault at 4.30\r\no'clock.  Meade asked to have the hour changed to six.  Deferring to his\r\nwishes as far as I was willing, the order was modified and five was\r\nfixed as the hour to move.\r\n\r\nHancock had now fully one-half of the Army of the Potomac. Wadsworth\r\nwith his division, which had arrived the night before, lay in a line\r\nperpendicular to that held by Hill, and to the right of Hancock.  He was\r\ndirected to move at the same time, and to attack Hill's left.\r\n\r\nBurnside, who was coming up with two divisions, was directed to get in\r\nbetween Warren and Wadsworth, and attack as soon as he could get in\r\nposition to do so.  Sedgwick and Warren were to make attacks in their\r\nfront, to detain as many of the enemy as they could and to take\r\nadvantage of any attempt to reinforce Hill from that quarter.  Burnside\r\nwas ordered if he should succeed in breaking the enemy's centre, to\r\nswing around to the left and envelop the right of Lee's army.  Hancock\r\nwas informed of all the movements ordered.\r\n\r\nBurnside had three divisions, but one of them--a colored division--was\r\nsent to guard the wagon train, and he did not see it again until July.\r\n\r\nLee was evidently very anxious that there should be no battle on his\r\nright until Longstreet got up.  This is evident from the fact that\r\nnotwithstanding the early hour at which I had ordered the assault, both\r\nfor the purpose of being the attacking party and to strike before\r\nLongstreet got up, Lee was ahead in his assault on our right.  His\r\npurpose was evident, but he failed.\r\n\r\nHancock was ready to advance by the hour named, but learning in time\r\nthat Longstreet was moving a part of his corps by the Catharpin Road,\r\nthus threatening his left flank, sent a division of infantry, commanded\r\nby General Barlow, with all his artillery, to cover the approaches by\r\nwhich Longstreet was expected.  This disposition was made in time to\r\nattack as ordered.  Hancock moved by the left of the Orange Plank Road,\r\nand Wadsworth by the right of it. The fighting was desperate for about\r\nan hour, when the enemy began to break up in great confusion.\r\n\r\nI believed then, and see no reason to change that opinion now, that if\r\nthe country had been such that Hancock and his command could have seen\r\nthe confusion and panic in the lines of the enemy, it would have been\r\ntaken advantage of so effectually that Lee would not have made another\r\nstand outside of his Richmond defences.\r\n\r\nGibbon commanded Hancock's left, and was ordered to attack, but was not\r\nable to accomplish much.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 6th Sheridan was sent to connect with Hancock's\r\nleft and attack the enemy's cavalry who were trying to get on our left\r\nand rear.  He met them at the intersection of the Furnace and Brock\r\nroads and at Todd's Tavern, and defeated them at both places.  Later he\r\nwas attacked, and again the enemy was repulsed.\r\n\r\nHancock heard the firing between Sheridan and Stuart, and thinking the\r\nenemy coming by that road, still further reinforced his position\r\nguarding the entrance to the Brock Road.  Another incident happened\r\nduring the day to further induce Hancock to weaken his attacking column.\r\nWord reached him that troops were seen moving towards him from the\r\ndirection of Todd's Tavern, and Brooke's brigade was detached to meet\r\nthis new enemy; but the troops approaching proved to be several hundred\r\nconvalescents coming from Chancellorsville, by the road Hancock had\r\nadvanced upon, to join their respective commands.  At 6.50 o'clock A.M.,\r\nBurnside, who had passed Wilderness Tavern at six o'clock, was ordered\r\nto send a division to the support of Hancock, but to continue with the\r\nremainder of his command in the execution of his previous order.  The\r\ndifficulty of making a way through the dense forests prevented Burnside\r\nfrom getting up in time to be of any service on the forenoon of the\r\nsixth.\r\n\r\nHancock followed Hill's retreating forces, in the morning, a mile or\r\nmore.  He maintained this position until, along in the afternoon,\r\nLongstreet came upon him.  The retreating column of Hill meeting\r\nreinforcements that had not yet been engaged, became encouraged and\r\nreturned with them.  They were enabled, from the density of the forest,\r\nto approach within a few hundred yards of our advance before being\r\ndiscovered.  Falling upon a brigade of Hancock's corps thrown to the\r\nadvance, they swept it away almost instantly.  The enemy followed up his\r\nadvantage and soon came upon Mott's division, which fell back in great\r\nconfusion.  Hancock made dispositions to hold his advanced position, but\r\nafter holding it for a time, fell back into the position that he had\r\nheld in the morning, which was strongly intrenched.  In this engagement\r\nthe intrepid Wadsworth while trying to rally his men was mortally\r\nwounded and fell into the hands of the enemy.  The enemy followed up,\r\nbut made no immediate attack.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate General Jenkins was killed and Longstreet seriously\r\nwounded in this engagement.  Longstreet had to leave the field, not to\r\nresume command for many weeks.  His loss was a severe one to Lee, and\r\ncompensated in a great measure for the mishap, or misapprehensions,\r\nwhich had fallen to our lot during the day.\r\n\r\nAfter Longstreet's removal from the field Lee took command of his right\r\nin person.  He was not able, however, to rally his men to attack\r\nHancock's position, and withdrew from our front for the purpose of\r\nreforming.  Hancock sent a brigade to clear his front of all remnants\r\nthat might be left of Longstreet's or Hill's commands.  This brigade\r\nhaving been formed at right angles to the intrenchments held by\r\nHancock's command, swept down the whole length of them from left to\r\nright.  A brigade of the enemy was encountered in this move; but it\r\nbroke and disappeared without a contest.\r\n\r\nFiring was continued after this, but with less fury.  Burnside had not\r\nyet been able to get up to render any assistance.  But it was now only\r\nabout nine in the morning, and he was getting into position on Hancock's\r\nright.\r\n\r\nAt 4.15 in the afternoon Lee attacked our left.  His line moved up to\r\nwithin a hundred yards of ours and opened a heavy fire. This status was\r\nmaintained for about half an hour.  Then a part of Mott's division and\r\nWard's brigade of Birney's division gave way and retired in disorder.\r\nThe enemy under R. H. Anderson took advantage of this and pushed through\r\nour line, planting their flags on a part of the intrenchments not on\r\nfire.  But owing to the efforts of Hancock, their success was but\r\ntemporary.  Carroll, of Gibbon's division, moved at a double quick with\r\nhis brigade and drove back the enemy, inflicting great loss.  Fighting\r\nhad continued from five in the morning sometimes along the whole line,\r\nat other times only in places. The ground fought over had varied in\r\nwidth, but averaged three-quarters of a mile.  The killed, and many of\r\nthe severely wounded, of both armies, lay within this belt where it was\r\nimpossible to reach them.  The woods were set on fire by the bursting\r\nshells, and the conflagration raged.  The wounded who had not strength\r\nto move themselves were either suffocated or burned to death.  Finally\r\nthe fire communicated with our breastworks, in places.  Being\r\nconstructed of wood, they burned with great fury.  But the battle still\r\nraged, our men firing through the flames until it became too hot to\r\nremain longer.\r\n\r\nLee was now in distress.  His men were in confusion, and his personal\r\nefforts failed to restore order.  These facts, however, were learned\r\nsubsequently, or we would have taken advantage of his condition and no\r\ndoubt gained a decisive success.  His troops were withdrawn now, but I\r\nrevoked the order, which I had given previously to this assault, for\r\nHancock to attack, because his troops had exhausted their ammunition and\r\ndid not have time to replenish from the train, which was at some\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nBurnside, Sedgwick, and Warren had all kept up an assault during all\r\nthis time; but their efforts had no other effect than to prevent the\r\nenemy from reinforcing his right from the troops in their front.\r\n\r\nI had, on the 5th, ordered all the bridges over the Rapidan to be taken\r\nup except one at Germania Ford.\r\n\r\nThe troops on Sedgwick's right had been sent to enforce our left.  This\r\nleft our right in danger of being turned, and us of being cut off from\r\nall present base of supplies.  Sedgwick had refused his right and\r\nintrenched it for protection against attack.  But late in the afternoon\r\nof the 6th Early came out from his lines in considerable force and got\r\nin upon Sedgwick's right, notwithstanding the precautions taken, and\r\ncreated considerable confusion.  Early captured several hundred\r\nprisoners, among them two general officers.  The defence, however, was\r\nvigorous; and night coming on, the enemy was thrown into as much\r\nconfusion as our troops, engaged, were.  Early says in his Memoirs that\r\nif we had discovered the confusion in his lines we might have brought\r\nfresh troops to his great discomfort.  Many officers, who had not been\r\nattacked by Early, continued coming to my headquarters even after\r\nSedgwick had rectified his lines a little farther to the rear, with news\r\nof the disaster, fully impressed with the idea that the enemy was\r\npushing on and would soon be upon me.\r\n\r\nDuring the night all of Lee's army withdrew within their intrenchments.\r\nOn the morning of the 7th General Custer drove the enemy's cavalry from\r\nCatharpin Furnace to Todd's Tavern. Pickets and skirmishers were sent\r\nalong our entire front to find the position of the enemy.  Some went as\r\nfar as a mile and a half before finding him. But Lee showed no\r\ndisposition to come out of his Works.  There was no battle during the\r\nday, and but little firing except in Warren's front; he being directed\r\nabout noon to make a reconnoissance in force.  This drew some sharp\r\nfiring, but there was no attempt on the part of Lee to drive him back.\r\nThis ended the Battle of the Wilderness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE BATTLE--TELEGRAPH AND SIGNAL SERVICE--MOVEMENT BY THE LEFT\r\nFLANK.\r\n\r\nMore desperate fighting has not been witnessed on this continent than\r\nthat of the 5th and 6th of May.  Our victory consisted in having\r\nsuccessfully crossed a formidable stream, almost in the face of an\r\nenemy, and in getting the army together as a unit. We gained an\r\nadvantage on the morning of the 6th, which, if it had been followed up,\r\nmust have proven very decisive.  In the evening the enemy gained an\r\nadvantage; but was speedily repulsed.  As we stood at the close, the two\r\narmies were relatively in about the same condition to meet each other as\r\nwhen the river divided them.  But the fact of having safely crossed was\r\na victory.\r\n\r\nOur losses in the Wilderness were very severe.  Those of the\r\nConfederates must have been even more so; but I have no means of\r\nspeaking with accuracy upon this point.  The Germania Ford bridge was\r\ntransferred to Ely's Ford to facilitate the transportation of the\r\nwounded to Washington.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well here as elsewhere to state two things connected with\r\nall movements of the Army of the Potomac:  first, in every change of\r\nposition or halt for the night, whether confronting the enemy or not,\r\nthe moment arms were stacked the men intrenched themselves.  For this\r\npurpose they would build up piles of logs or rails if they could be\r\nfound in their front, and dig a ditch, throwing the dirt forward on the\r\ntimber.  Thus the digging they did counted in making a depression to\r\nstand in, and increased the elevation in front of them.  It was\r\nwonderful how quickly they could in this way construct defences of\r\nconsiderable strength.  When a halt was made with the view of assaulting\r\nthe enemy, or in his presence, these would be strengthened or their\r\npositions changed under the direction of engineer officers.  The second\r\nwas, the use made of the telegraph and signal corps.  Nothing could be\r\nmore complete than the organization and discipline of this body of brave\r\nand intelligent men.  Insulated wires--insulated so that they would\r\ntransmit messages in a storm, on the ground or under water--were wound\r\nupon reels, making about two hundred pounds weight of wire to each reel.\r\nTwo men and one mule were detailed to each reel.  The pack-saddle on\r\nwhich this was carried was provided with a rack like a sawbuck placed\r\ncrosswise of the saddle, and raised above it so that the reel, with its\r\nwire, would revolve freely.  There was a wagon, supplied with a\r\ntelegraph operator, battery and telegraph instruments for each division,\r\neach corps, each army, and one for my headquarters.  There were wagons\r\nalso loaded with light poles, about the size and length of a wall tent\r\npole, supplied with an iron spike in one end, used to hold the wires up\r\nwhen laid, so that wagons and artillery would not run over them.  The\r\nmules thus loaded were assigned to brigades, and always kept with the\r\ncommand they were assigned to.  The operators were also assigned to\r\nparticular headquarters, and never changed except by special orders.\r\n\r\nThe moment the troops were put in position to go into camp all the men\r\nconnected with this branch of service would proceed to put up their\r\nwires.  A mule loaded with a coil of wire would be led to the rear of\r\nthe nearest flank of the brigade he belonged to, and would be led in a\r\nline parallel thereto, while one man would hold an end of the wire and\r\nuncoil it as the mule was led off.  When he had walked the length of the\r\nwire the whole of it would be on the ground.  This would be done in rear\r\nof every brigade at the same time.  The ends of all the wires would then\r\nbe joined, making a continuous wire in the rear of the whole army.  The\r\nmen, attached to brigades or divisions, would all commence at once\r\nraising the wires with their telegraph poles. This was done by making a\r\nloop in the wire and putting it over the spike and raising the pole to a\r\nperpendicular position.  At intervals the wire would be attached to\r\ntrees, or some other permanent object, so that one pole was sufficient\r\nat a place. In the absence of such a support two poles would have to be\r\nused, at intervals, placed at an angle so as to hold the wire firm in\r\nits place.  While this was being done the telegraph wagons would take\r\ntheir positions near where the headquarters they belonged to were to be\r\nestablished, and would connect with the wire. Thus, in a few minutes\r\nlonger time than it took a mule to walk the length of its coil,\r\ntelegraphic communication would be effected between all the headquarters\r\nof the army.  No orders ever had to be given to establish the telegraph.\r\n\r\nThe signal service was used on the march.  The men composing this corps\r\nwere assigned to specified commands.  When movements were made, they\r\nwould go in advance, or on the flanks, and seize upon high points of\r\nground giving a commanding view of the country, if cleared, or would\r\nclimb tall trees on the highest points if not cleared, and would denote,\r\nby signals, the positions of different parts of our own army, and often\r\nthe movements of the enemy.  They would also take off the signals of the\r\nenemy and transmit them.  It would sometimes take too long a time to\r\nmake translations of intercepted dispatches for us to receive any\r\nbenefit from them.  But sometimes they gave useful information.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 7th I received news from Washington announcing\r\nthat Sherman had probably attacked Johnston that day, and that Butler\r\nhad reached City Point safely and taken it by surprise on the 5th.  I\r\nhad given orders for a movement by the left flank, fearing that Lee\r\nmight move rapidly to Richmond to crush Butler before I could get there.\r\n\r\nMy order for this movement was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S., May 7, 1864, 6.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Commanding A. P.\r\n\r\nMake all preparations during the day for a night march to take position\r\nat Spottsylvania C. H. with one army corps, at Todd's Tavern with one,\r\nand another near the intersection of the Piney Branch and Spottsylvania\r\nroad with the road from Alsop's to Old Court House.  If this move is\r\nmade the trains should be thrown forward early in the morning to the Ny\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nI think it would be advisable in making the change to leave Hancock\r\nwhere he is until Warren passes him.  He could then follow and become\r\nthe right of the new line.  Burnside will move to Piney Branch Church.\r\nSedgwick can move along the pike to Chancellorsville and on to his\r\ndestination.  Burnside will move on the plank road to the intersection\r\nof it with the Orange and Fredericksburg plank road, then follow\r\nSedgwick to his place of destination.\r\n\r\nAll vehicles should be got out of hearing of the enemy before the troops\r\nmove, and then move off quietly.\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that the enemy concentrate for a heavy attack\r\non Hancock this afternoon.  In case they do we must be prepared to\r\nresist them, and follow up any success we may gain, with our whole\r\nforce.  Such a result would necessarily modify these instructions.\r\n\r\nAll the hospitals should be moved to-day to Chancellorsville.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the 7th Sheridan had a fight with the rebel cavalry at Todd's\r\nTavern, but routed them, thus opening the way for the troops that were\r\nto go by that route at night.  Soon after dark Warren withdrew from the\r\nfront of the enemy, and was soon followed by Sedgwick.  Warren's march\r\ncarried him immediately behind the works where Hancock's command lay on\r\nthe Brock Road.  With my staff and a small escort of cavalry I preceded\r\nthe troops.  Meade with his staff accompanied me.  The greatest\r\nenthusiasm was manifested by Hancock's men as we passed by.  No doubt it\r\nwas inspired by the fact that the movement was south. It indicated to\r\nthem that they had passed through the \"beginning of the end\" in the\r\nbattle just fought.  The cheering was so lusty that the enemy must have\r\ntaken it for a night attack.  At all events it drew from him a furious\r\nfusillade of artillery and musketry, plainly heard but not felt by us.\r\n\r\nMeade and I rode in advance.  We had passed but a little way beyond our\r\nleft when the road forked.  We looked to see, if we could, which road\r\nSheridan had taken with his cavalry during the day.  It seemed to be the\r\nright-hand one, and accordingly we took it.  We had not gone far,\r\nhowever, when Colonel C. B. Comstock, of my staff, with the instinct of\r\nthe engineer, suspecting that we were on a road that would lead us into\r\nthe lines of the enemy, if he, too, should be moving, dashed by at a\r\nrapid gallop and all alone.  In a few minutes he returned and reported\r\nthat Lee was moving, and that the road we were on would bring us into\r\nhis lines in a short distance.  We returned to the forks of the road,\r\nleft a man to indicate the right road to the head of Warren's column\r\nwhen it should come up, and continued our journey to Todd's Tavern,\r\nwhere we arrived after midnight.\r\n\r\nMy object in moving to Spottsylvania was two-fold:  first, I did not\r\nwant Lee to get back to Richmond in time to attempt to crush Butler\r\nbefore I could get there; second, I wanted to get between his army and\r\nRichmond if possible; and, if not, to draw him into the open field.  But\r\nLee, by accident, beat us to Spottsylvania.  Our wagon trains had been\r\nordered easterly of the roads the troops were to march upon before the\r\nmovement commenced.  Lee interpreted this as a semi-retreat of the Army\r\nof the Potomac to Fredericksburg, and so informed his government.\r\nAccordingly he ordered Longstreet's corps--now commanded by Anderson--to\r\nmove in the morning (the 8th) to Spottsylvania.  But the woods being\r\nstill on fire, Anderson could not go into bivouac, and marched directly\r\non to his destination that night.  By this accident Lee got possession\r\nof Spottsylvania.  It is impossible to say now what would have been the\r\nresult if Lee's orders had been obeyed as given; but it is certain that\r\nwe would have been in Spottsylvania, and between him and his capital.\r\nMy belief is that there would have been a race between the two armies to\r\nsee which could reach Richmond first, and the Army of the Potomac would\r\nhave had the shorter line.  Thus, twice since crossing the Rapidan we\r\ncame near closing the campaign, so far as battles were concerned, from\r\nthe Rapidan to the James River or Richmond.  The first failure was\r\ncaused by our not following up the success gained over Hill's corps on\r\nthe morning of the 6th, as before described:  the second, when fires\r\ncaused by that battle drove Anderson to make a march during the night of\r\nthe 7th-8th which he was ordered to commence on the morning of the 8th.\r\nBut accident often decides the fate of battle.\r\n\r\nSheridan's cavalry had had considerable fighting during the afternoon of\r\nthe 7th, lasting at Todd's Tavern until after night, with the field his\r\nat the close.  He issued the necessary orders for seizing Spottsylvania\r\nand holding the bridge over the Po River, which Lee's troops would have\r\nto cross to get to Spottsylvania.  But Meade changed Sheridan's orders\r\nto Merritt--who was holding the bridge--on his arrival at Todd's Tavern,\r\nand thereby left the road free for Anderson when he came up.  Wilson,\r\nwho was ordered to seize the town, did so, with his division of cavalry;\r\nbut he could not hold it against the Confederate corps which had not\r\nbeen detained at the crossing of the Po, as it would have been but for\r\nthe unfortunate change in Merritt's orders.  Had he been permitted to\r\nexecute the orders Sheridan gave him, he would have been guarding with\r\ntwo brigades of cavalry the bridge over the Po River which Anderson had\r\nto cross, and must have detained him long enough to enable Warren to\r\nreinforce Wilson and hold the town.\r\n\r\nAnderson soon intrenched himself--if indeed the intrenchments were not\r\nalready made--immediately across Warren's front. Warren was not aware of\r\nhis presence, but probably supposed it was the cavalry which Merritt had\r\nengaged earlier in the day. He assaulted at once, but was repulsed.  He\r\nsoon organized his men, as they were not pursued by the enemy, and made\r\na second attack, this time with his whole corps.  This time he succeeded\r\nin gaining a position immediately in the enemy's front, where he\r\nintrenched.  His right and left divisions--the former Crawford's, the\r\nlatter Wadsworth's, now commanded by Cutler--drove the enemy back some\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAt this time my headquarters had been advanced to Piney Branch Church.\r\nI was anxious to crush Anderson before Lee could get a force to his\r\nsupport.  To this end Sedgwick who was at Piney Branch Church, was\r\nordered to Warren's support.  Hancock, who was at Todd's Tavern, was\r\nnotified of Warren's engagement, and was directed to be in readiness to\r\ncome up.  Burnside, who was with the wagon trains at Aldrich's on our\r\nextreme left, received the same instructions.  Sedgwick was slow in\r\ngetting up for some reason--probably unavoidable, because he was never\r\nat fault when serious work was to be done--so that it was near night\r\nbefore the combined forces were ready to attack.  Even then all of\r\nSedgwick's command did not get into the engagement.  Warren led the last\r\nassault, one division at a time, and of course it failed.\r\n\r\nWarren's difficulty was twofold:  when he received an order to do\r\nanything, it would at once occur to his mind how all the balance of the\r\narmy should be engaged so as properly to co-operate with him.  His ideas\r\nwere generally good, but he would forget that the person giving him\r\norders had thought of others at the time he had of him.  In like manner,\r\nwhen he did get ready to execute an order, after giving most intelligent\r\ninstructions to division commanders, he would go in with one division,\r\nholding the others in reserve until he could superintend their movements\r\nin person also, forgetting that division commanders could execute an\r\norder without his presence.  His difficulty was constitutional and\r\nbeyond his control.  He was an officer of superior ability, quick\r\nperceptions, and personal courage to accomplish anything that could be\r\ndone with a small command.\r\n\r\nLee had ordered Hill's corps--now commanded by Early--to move by the\r\nvery road we had marched upon.  This shows that even early in the\r\nmorning of the 8th Lee had not yet become acquainted with my move, but\r\nstill thought that the Army of the Potomac had gone to Fredericksburg.\r\nIndeed, he informed the authorities at Richmond he had possession of\r\nSpottsylvania and was on my flank. Anderson was in possession of\r\nSpottsylvania, through no foresight of Lee, however.  Early only found\r\nthat he had been following us when he ran against Hancock at Todd's\r\nTavern.  His coming detained Hancock from the battle-field of\r\nSpottsylvania for that day; but he, in like manner, kept Early back and\r\nforced him to move by another route.\r\n\r\nHad I ordered the movement for the night of the 7th by my left flank, it\r\nwould have put Hancock in the lead.  It would also have given us an hour\r\nor earlier start.  It took all that time for Warren to get the head of\r\nhis column to the left of Hancock after he had got his troops out of\r\ntheir line confronting the enemy.  This hour, and Hancock's capacity to\r\nuse his whole force when necessary, would, no doubt, have enabled him to\r\ncrush Anderson before he could be reinforced.  But the movement made was\r\ntactical.  It kept the troops in mass against a possible assault by the\r\nenemy.  Our left occupied its intrenchments while the two corps to the\r\nright passed.  If an attack had been made by the enemy he would have\r\nfound the 2d corps in position, fortified, and, practically, the 5th and\r\n6th corps in position as reserves, until his entire front was passed.\r\nBy a left flank movement the army would have been scattered while still\r\npassing the front of the enemy, and before the extreme right had got by\r\nit would have been very much exposed.  Then, too, I had not yet learned\r\nthe special qualifications of the different corps commanders.  At that\r\ntime my judgment was that Warren was the man I would suggest to succeed\r\nMeade should anything happen to that gallant soldier to take him from\r\nthe field.  As I have before said, Warren was a gallant soldier, an able\r\nman; and he was beside thoroughly imbued with the solemnity and\r\nimportance of the duty he had to perform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF SPOTTSYLVANIA--HANCOCK'S POSITION--ASSAULT OF WARREN'S AND\r\nWRIGHT'S CORPS--UPTON PROMOTED ON THE FIELD--GOOD NEWS FROM BUTLER AND\r\nSHERIDAN.\r\n\r\nThe Mattapony River is formed by the junction of the Mat, the Ta, the Po\r\nand the Ny rivers, the last being the northernmost of the four.  It\r\ntakes its rise about a mile south and a little east of the Wilderness\r\nTavern.  The Po rises south-west of the place, but farther away.\r\nSpottsylvania is on the ridge dividing these two streams, and where they\r\nare but a few miles apart.  The Brock Road reaches Spottsylvania without\r\ncrossing either of these streams. Lee's army coming up by the Catharpin\r\nRoad, had to cross the Po at Wooden Bridge.  Warren and Hancock came by\r\nthe Brock Road.  Sedgwick crossed the Ny at Catharpin Furnace. Burnside\r\ncoming by Aldrich's to Gates's house, had to cross the Ny near the\r\nenemy.  He found pickets at the bridge, but they were soon driven off by\r\na brigade of Willcox's division, and the stream was crossed.  This\r\nbrigade was furiously attacked; but the remainder of the division coming\r\nup, they were enabled to hold their position, and soon fortified it.\r\n\r\nAbout the time I received the news of this attack, word came from\r\nHancock that Early had left his front.  He had been forced over to the\r\nCatharpin Road, crossing the Po at Corbin's and again at Wooden Bridge.\r\nThese are the bridges Sheridan had given orders to his cavalry to occupy\r\non the 8th, while one division should occupy Spottsylvania.  These\r\nmovements of the enemy gave me the idea that Lee was about to make the\r\nattempt to get to, or towards, Fredericksburg to cut off my supplies.  I\r\nmade arrangements to attack his right and get between him and Richmond\r\nif he should try to execute this design.  If he had any such intention\r\nit was abandoned as soon as Burnside was established south of the Ny.\r\n\r\nThe Po and the Ny are narrow little streams, but deep, with abrupt\r\nbanks, and bordered by heavily wooded and marshy bottoms--at the time we\r\nwere there--and difficult to cross except where bridged.  The country\r\nabout was generally heavily timbered, but with occasional clearings.  It\r\nwas a much better country to conduct a defensive campaign in than an\r\noffensive one.\r\n\r\nBy noon of the 9th the position of the two armies was as follows:  Lee\r\noccupied a semicircle facing north, north-west and north-east, inclosing\r\nthe town.  Anderson was on his left extending to the Po, Ewell came\r\nnext, then Early.  Warren occupied our right, covering the Brock and\r\nother roads converging at Spottsylvania; Sedgwick was to his left and\r\nBurnside on our extreme left.  Hancock was yet back at Todd's Tavern,\r\nbut as soon as it was known that Early had left Hancock's front the\r\nlatter was ordered up to Warren's right.  He formed a line with three\r\ndivisions on the hill overlooking the Po early in the afternoon, and was\r\nordered to cross the Po and get on the enemy's flank.  The fourth\r\ndivision of Hancock's corps, Mott commanding, was left at Todd's when\r\nthe corps first came up; but in the afternoon it was brought up and\r\nplaced to the left of Sedgwick's--now Wright's--6th corps.  In the\r\nmorning General Sedgwick had been killed near the right of his\r\nintrenchments by rebel sharpshooters.  His loss was a severe one to the\r\nArmy of the Potomac and to the Nation.  General H. G. Wright succeeded\r\nhim in the command of his corps.\r\n\r\nHancock was now, nine P.M. of the 9th of May, across the left flank of\r\nLee's army, but separated from it, and also from the remainder of\r\nMeade's army, by the Po River.  But for the lateness of the hour and the\r\ndarkness of the night he would have attempted to cross the river again\r\nat Wooden Bridge, thus bringing himself on the same side with both\r\nfriend and foe.\r\n\r\nThe Po at the points where Hancock's corps crossed runs nearly due east.\r\nJust below his lower crossing--the troops crossed at three points--it\r\nturns due south, and after passing under Wooden Bridge soon resumes a\r\nmore easterly direction.  During the night this corps built three\r\nbridges over the Po; but these were in rear.\r\n\r\nThe position assumed by Hancock's corps forced Lee to reinforce his left\r\nduring the night.  Accordingly on the morning of the 10th, when Hancock\r\nrenewed his effort to get over the Po to his front, he found himself\r\nconfronted by some of Early's command, which had been brought from the\r\nextreme right of the enemy during the night.  He succeeded in effecting\r\na crossing with one brigade, however, but finding the enemy intrenched\r\nin his front, no more were crossed.\r\n\r\nHancock reconnoitred his front on the morning of the 10th, with the view\r\nof forcing a crossing, if it was found that an advantage could be\r\ngained.  The enemy was found strongly intrenched on the high ground\r\noverlooking the river, and commanding the Wooden Bridge with artillery.\r\nAnderson's left rested on the Po, where it turns south; therefore, for\r\nHancock to cross over--although it would bring him to the same side of\r\nthe stream with the rest of the army--would still farther isolate him\r\nfrom it.  The stream would have to be crossed twice in the face of the\r\nenemy to unite with the main body.  The idea of crossing was therefore\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nLee had weakened the other parts of his line to meet this movement of\r\nHancock's, and I determined to take advantage of it.  Accordingly in the\r\nmorning, orders were issued for an attack in the afternoon on the centre\r\nby Warren's and Wright's corps, Hancock to command all the attacking\r\nforce.  Two of his divisions were brought to the north side of the Po.\r\nGibbon was placed to the right of Warren, and Birney in his rear as a\r\nreserve.  Barlow's division was left south of the stream, and Mott of\r\nthe same corps was still to the left of Wright's corps.  Burnside was\r\nordered to reconnoitre his front in force, and, if an opportunity\r\npresented, to attack with vigor.  The enemy seeing Barlow's division\r\nisolated from the rest of the army, came out and attacked with fury.\r\nBarlow repulsed the assault with great slaughter, and with considerable\r\nloss to himself.  But the enemy reorganized and renewed the assault.\r\nBirney was now moved to the high ground overlooking the river crossings\r\nbuilt by our troops, and covered the crossings.  The second assault was\r\nrepulsed, again with severe loss to the enemy, and Barlow was withdrawn\r\nwithout further molestation. General T. G. Stevenson was killed in this\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nBetween the lines, where Warren's assault was to take place, there was a\r\nravine grown up with large trees and underbrush, making it almost\r\nimpenetrable by man.  The slopes on both sides were also covered with a\r\nheavy growth of timber.  Warren, before noon, reconnoitred his front\r\ntwice, the first time with one and the second with two divisions.  He\r\nwas repulsed on both occasions, but gained such information of the\r\nground as to induce him to report recommending the assault.\r\n\r\nWright also reconnoitred his front and gained a considerably advanced\r\nposition from the one he started from.  He then organized a storming\r\nparty, consisting of twelve regiments, and assigned Colonel Emory Upton,\r\nof the 121st New York Volunteers, to the command of it.  About four\r\no'clock in the afternoon the assault was ordered, Warren's and Wright's\r\ncorps, with Mott's division of Hancock's corps, to move simultaneously.\r\nThe movement was prompt, and in a few minutes the fiercest of struggles\r\nbegan.  The battle-field was so densely covered with forest that but\r\nlittle could be seen, by any one person, as to the progress made.  Meade\r\nand I occupied the best position we could get, in rear of Warren.\r\n\r\nWarren was repulsed with heavy loss, General J. C. Rice being among the\r\nkilled.  He was not followed, however, by the enemy, and was thereby\r\nenabled to reorganize his command as soon as covered from the guns of\r\nthe enemy.  To the left our success was decided, but the advantage was\r\nlost by the feeble action of Mott.  Upton with his assaulting party\r\npushed forward and crossed the enemy's intrenchments.  Turning to the\r\nright and left he captured several guns and some hundreds of prisoners.\r\nMott was ordered to his assistance but failed utterly.  So much time was\r\nlost in trying to get up the troops which were in the right position to\r\nreinforce, that I ordered Upton to withdraw; but the officers and men of\r\nhis command were so averse to giving up the advantage they had gained\r\nthat I withdrew the order.  To relieve them, I ordered a renewal of the\r\nassault.  By this time Hancock, who had gone with Birney's division to\r\nrelieve Barlow, had returned, bringing the division with him.  His corps\r\nwas now joined with Warren's and Wright's in this last assault.  It was\r\ngallantly made, many men getting up to, and over, the works of the\r\nenemy; but they were not able to hold them.  At night they were\r\nwithdrawn.  Upton brought his prisoners with him, but the guns he had\r\ncaptured he was obliged to abandon.  Upton had gained an important\r\nadvantage, but a lack in others of the spirit and dash possessed by him\r\nlost it to us.  Before leaving Washington I had been authorized to\r\npromote officers on the field for special acts of gallantry.  By this\r\nauthority I conferred the rank of brigadier-general upon Upton on the\r\nspot, and this act was confirmed by the President.  Upton had been badly\r\nwounded in this fight.\r\n\r\nBurnside on the left had got up to within a few hundred yards of\r\nSpottsylvania Court House, completely turning Lee's right.  He was not\r\naware of the importance of the advantage he had gained, and I, being\r\nwith the troops where the heavy fighting was, did not know of it at the\r\ntime.  He had gained his position with but little fighting, and almost\r\nwithout loss.  Burnside's position now separated him widely from\r\nWright's corps, the corps nearest to him.  At night he was ordered to\r\njoin on to this.  This brought him back about a mile, and lost to us an\r\nimportant advantage.  I attach no blame to Burnside for this, but I do\r\nto myself for not having had a staff officer with him to report to me\r\nhis position.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had not dared to come out of his line at any point to follow\r\nup his advantage, except in the single instance of his attack on Barlow.\r\nThen he was twice repulsed with heavy loss, though he had an entire\r\ncorps against two brigades.  Barlow took up his bridges in the presence\r\nof this force.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th there was no battle and but little firing; none except by\r\nMott who made a reconnoissance to ascertain if there was a weak point in\r\nthe enemy's line.\r\n\r\nI wrote the following letter to General Halleck:\r\n\r\n\r\nNEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H., May 11, 1864--8.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Chief of Staff of the Army, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nWe have now ended the 6th day of very hard fighting.  The result up to\r\nthis time is much in our favor.  But our losses have been heavy as well\r\nas those of the enemy.  We have lost to this time eleven general\r\nofficers killed, wounded and missing, and probably twenty thousand men.\r\nI think the loss of the enemy must be greater--we having taken over four\r\nthousand prisoners in battle, whilst he has taken from us but few except\r\na few stragglers.  I am now sending back to Belle Plain all my wagons\r\nfor a fresh supply of provisions and ammunition, and purpose to fight it\r\nout on this line if it takes all summer.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of reinforcements here will be very encouraging to the men,\r\nand I hope they will be sent as fast as possible, and in as great\r\nnumbers.  My object in having them sent to Belle Plain was to use them\r\nas an escort to our supply trains.  If it is more convenient to send\r\nthem out by train to march from the railroad to Belle Plain or\r\nFredericksburg, send them so.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied the enemy are very shaky, and are only kept up to the\r\nmark by the greatest exertions on the part of their officers, and by\r\nkeeping them intrenched in every position they take.\r\n\r\nUp to this time there is no indication of any portion of Lee's army\r\nbeing detached for the defence of Richmond.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd also, I received information, through the War Department, from\r\nGeneral Butler that his cavalry under Kautz had cut the railroad south\r\nof Petersburg, separating Beauregard from Richmond, and had whipped\r\nHill, killing, wounding and capturing many.  Also that he was\r\nintrenched, and could maintain himself.  On this same day came news from\r\nSheridan to the effect that he had destroyed ten miles of the railroad\r\nand telegraph between Lee and Richmond, one and a half million rations,\r\nand most of the medical stores for his army.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th I had directed Sheridan verbally to cut loose from the Army\r\nof the Potomac and pass around the left of Lee's army and attack his\r\ncavalry and communications, which was successfully executed in the\r\nmanner I have already described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nHANCOCK'S ASSAULT-LOSSES OF THE CONFEDERATES--PROMOTIONS RECOMMENDED\r\n--DISCOMFITURE OF THE ENEMY--EWELL'S ATTACK-REDUCING THE ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\nIn the reconnoissance made by Mott on the 11th, a salient was discovered\r\nat the right centre. I determined that an assault should be made at that\r\npoint. (*28) Accordingly in the afternoon Hancock was ordered to move\r\nhis command by the rear of Warren and Wright, under cover of night, to\r\nWright's left, and there form it for an assault at four o'clock the next\r\nmorning.  The night was dark, it rained heavily, and the road was\r\ndifficult, so that it was midnight when he reached the point where he\r\nwas to halt.  It took most of the night to get the men in position for\r\ntheir advance in the morning.  The men got but little rest.  Burnside\r\nwas ordered to attack (*29) on the left of the salient at the same hour.\r\nI sent two of my staff officers to impress upon him the importance of\r\npushing forward vigorously.  Hancock was notified of this.  Warren and\r\nWright were ordered to hold themselves in readiness to join in the\r\nassault if circumstances made it advisable.  I occupied a central\r\nposition most convenient for receiving information from all points.\r\nHancock put Barlow on his left, in double column, and Birney to his\r\nright.  Mott followed Birney, and Gibbon was held in reserve.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 12th opened foggy, delaying the start more than half\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nThe ground over which Hancock had to pass to reach the enemy, was\r\nascending and heavily wooded to within two or three hundred yards of the\r\nenemy's intrenchments.  In front of Birney there was also a marsh to\r\ncross.  But, notwithstanding all these difficulties, the troops pushed\r\non in quick time without firing a gun, and when within four or five\r\nhundred yards of the enemy's line broke out in loud cheers, and with a\r\nrush went up to and over the breastworks.  Barlow and Birney entered\r\nalmost simultaneously.  Here a desperate hand-to-hand conflict took\r\nplace.  The men of the two sides were too close together to fire, but\r\nused their guns as clubs.  The hand conflict was soon over.  Hancock's\r\ncorps captured some four thousand prisoners among them a division and a\r\nbrigade commander twenty or more guns with their horses, caissons, and\r\nammunition, several thousand stand of arms, and many colors.  Hancock,\r\nas soon as the hand-to-hand conflict was over, turned the guns of the\r\nenemy against him and advanced inside the rebel lines.  About six\r\no'clock I ordered Warren's corps to the support of Hancock's. Burnside,\r\non the left, had advanced up east of the salient to the very parapet of\r\nthe enemy.  Potter, commanding one of his divisions, got over but was\r\nnot able to remain there.  However, he inflicted a heavy loss upon the\r\nenemy; but not without loss in return.\r\n\r\nThis victory was important, and one that Lee could not afford to leave\r\nus in full possession of.  He made the most strenuous efforts to regain\r\nthe position he had lost.  Troops were brought up from his left and\r\nattacked Hancock furiously.  Hancock was forced to fall back:  but he\r\ndid so slowly, with his face to the enemy, inflicting on him heavy loss,\r\nuntil behind the breastworks he had captured.  These he turned, facing\r\nthem the other way, and continued to hold.  Wright was ordered up to\r\nreinforce Hancock, and arrived by six o'clock.  He was wounded soon\r\nafter coming up but did not relinquish the command of his corps,\r\nalthough the fighting lasted until one o'clock the next morning.  At\r\neight o'clock Warren was ordered up again, but was so slow in making his\r\ndispositions that his orders were frequently repeated, and with\r\nemphasis.  At eleven o'clock I gave Meade written orders to relieve\r\nWarren from his command if he failed to move promptly. Hancock placed\r\nbatteries on high ground in his rear, which he used against the enemy,\r\nfiring over the heads of his own troops.\r\n\r\nBurnside accomplished but little on our left of a positive nature, but\r\nnegatively a great deal.  He kept Lee from reinforcing his centre from\r\nthat quarter.  If the 5th corps, or rather if Warren, had been as prompt\r\nas Wright was with the 6th corps, better results might have been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nLee massed heavily from his left flank on the broken point of his line.\r\nFive times during the day he assaulted furiously, but without dislodging\r\nour troops from their new position.  His losses must have been fearful.\r\nSometimes the belligerents would be separated by but a few feet.  In one\r\nplace a tree, eighteen inches in diameter, was cut entirely down by\r\nmusket balls.  All the trees between the lines were very much cut to\r\npieces by artillery and musketry.  It was three o'clock next morning\r\nbefore the fighting ceased.  Some of our troops had then been twenty\r\nhours under fire.  In this engagement we did not lose a single\r\norganization, not even a company.  The enemy lost one division with its\r\ncommander, one brigade and one regiment, with heavy losses\r\nelsewhere.(*30)  Our losses were heavy, but, as stated, no whole company\r\nwas captured.  At night Lee took a position in rear of his former one,\r\nand by the following morning he was strongly intrenched in it.\r\n\r\nWarren's corps was now temporarily broken up, Cutler's division sent to\r\nWright, and Griffin's to Hancock.  Meade ordered his chief of staff,\r\nGeneral Humphreys, to remain with Warren and the remaining division, and\r\nauthorized him to give it orders in his name.\r\n\r\nDuring the day I was passing along the line from wing to wing\r\ncontinuously.  About the centre stood a house which proved to be\r\noccupied by an old lady and her daughter.  She showed such unmistakable\r\nsigns of being strongly Union that I stopped.  She said she had not seen\r\na Union flag for so long a time that it did her heart good to look upon\r\nit again.  She said her husband and son, being, Union men, had had to\r\nleave early in the war, and were now somewhere in the Union army, if\r\nalive.  She was without food or nearly so, so I ordered rations issued\r\nto her, and promised to find out if I could where the husband and son\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nThere was no fighting on the 13th, further than a little skirmishing\r\nbetween Mott's division and the enemy.  I was afraid that Lee might be\r\nmoving out, and I did not want him to go without my knowing it. The\r\nindications were that he was moving, but it was found that he was only\r\ntaking his new position back from the salient that had been captured.\r\nOur dead were buried this day.  Mott's division was reduced to a\r\nbrigade, and assigned to Birney's division.\r\n\r\nDuring this day I wrote to Washington recommending Sherman and Meade\r\n(*31) for promotion to the grade of Major-General in the regular army;\r\nHancock for Brigadier-General; Wright, Gibbon and Humphreys to be\r\nMajor-Generals of Volunteers; and Upton and Carroll to be Brigadiers.\r\nUpton had already been named as such, but the appointment had to be\r\nconfirmed by the Senate on the nomination of the President.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 13th Warren and Wright were moved by the rear to the\r\nleft of Burnside.  The night was very dark and it rained heavily, the\r\nroads were so bad that the troops had to cut trees and corduroy the road\r\na part of the way, to get through.  It was midnight before they got to\r\nthe point where they were to halt, and daylight before the troops could\r\nbe organized to advance to their position in line.  They gained their\r\nposition in line, however, without any fighting, except a little in\r\nWright's front.  Here Upton had to contend for an elevation which we\r\nwanted and which the enemy was not disposed to yield.  Upton first drove\r\nthe enemy, and was then repulsed in turn.  Ayres coming to his support\r\nwith his brigade (of Griffin's division, Warren's corps), the position\r\nwas secured and fortified.  There was no more battle during the 14th.\r\nThis brought our line east of the Court House and running north and\r\nsouth and facing west.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 14th-15th Lee moved to cover this new front.\r\nThis left Hancock without an enemy confronting him.  He was brought to\r\nthe rear of our new centre, ready to be moved in any direction he might\r\nbe wanted.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th news came from Butler and Averill.  The former reported the\r\ncapture of the outer works at Drury's Bluff, on the James River, and\r\nthat his cavalry had cut the railroad and telegraph south of Richmond on\r\nthe Danville road:  and the latter, the destruction of a depot of\r\nsupplies at Dublin, West Virginia, and the breaking of New River Bridge\r\non the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.  The next day news came from\r\nSherman and Sheridan.  Sherman had forced Johnston out of Dalton,\r\nGeorgia, and was following him south.  The report from Sheridan embraced\r\nhis operations up to his passing the outer defences of Richmond.  The\r\nprospect must now have been dismal in Richmond. The road and telegraph\r\nwere cut between the capital and Lee. The roads and wires were cut in\r\nevery direction from the rebel capital.  Temporarily that city was cut\r\noff from all communication with the outside except by courier.  This\r\ncondition of affairs, however, was of but short duration.\r\n\r\nI wrote Halleck:\r\n\r\n\r\nNEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H., May 16, 1864, 8 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Washington, D. C.:\r\n\r\nWe have had five days almost constant rain without any prospect yet of\r\nit clearing up.  The roads have now become so impassable that ambulances\r\nwith wounded men can no longer run between here and Fredericksburg.  All\r\noffensive operations necessarily cease until we can have twenty-four\r\nhours of dry weather.  The army is in the best of spirits, and feel the\r\ngreatest confidence of ultimate success. *        *        *        *\r\n*        * You can assure the President and Secretary of War that the\r\nelements alone have suspended hostilities, and that it is in no manner\r\ndue to weakness or exhaustion on our part.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition of the roads was such that nothing was done on the 17th.\r\nBut that night Hancock and Wright were to make a night march back to\r\ntheir old positions, and to make an assault at four o'clock in the\r\nmorning.  Lee got troops back in time to protect his old line, so the\r\nassault was unsuccessful.  On this day (18th) the news was almost as\r\ndiscouraging to us as it had been two days before in the rebel capital.\r\nAs stated above, Hancock's and Wright's corps had made an unsuccessful\r\nassault. News came that Sigel had been defeated at New Market, badly,\r\nand was retreating down the valley.  Not two hours before, I had sent\r\nthe inquiry to Halleck whether Sigel could not get to Staunton to stop\r\nsupplies coming from there to Lee.  I asked at once that Sigel might be\r\nrelieved, and some one else put in his place. Hunter's name was\r\nsuggested, and I heartily approved.  Further news from Butler reported\r\nhim driven from Drury's Bluff, but still in possession of the Petersburg\r\nroad.  Banks had been defeated in Louisiana, relieved, and Canby put in\r\nhis place. This change of commander was not on my suggestion.  All this\r\nnews was very discouraging.  All of it must have been known by the enemy\r\nbefore it was by me.  In fact, the good news (for the enemy) must have\r\nbeen known to him at the moment I thought he was in despair, and his\r\nanguish had been already relieved when we were enjoying his supposed\r\ndiscomfiture, But this was no time for repining.  I immediately gave\r\norders for a movement by the left flank, on towards Richmond, to\r\ncommence on the night of the 19th.  I also asked Halleck to secure the\r\ncooperation of the navy in changing our base of supplies from\r\nFredericksburg to Port Royal, on the Rappahannock.\r\n\r\nUp to this time I had received no reinforcements, except six thousand\r\nraw troops under Brigadier General Robert O. Tyler, just arrived.  They\r\nhad not yet joined their command, Hancock's corps, but were on our\r\nright.  This corps had been brought to the rear of the centre, ready to\r\nmove in any direction.  Lee, probably suspecting some move on my part,\r\nand seeing our right entirely abandoned, moved Ewell's corps about five\r\no'clock in the afternoon, with Early's as a reserve, to attack us in\r\nthat quarter.  Tyler had come up from Fredericksburg, and had been\r\nhalted on the road to the right of our line, near Kitching's brigade of\r\nWarren's corps.  Tyler received the attack with his raw troops, and they\r\nmaintained their position, until reinforced, in a manner worthy of\r\nveterans.\r\n\r\nHancock was in a position to reinforce speedily, and was the soldier to\r\ndo it without waiting to make dispositions.  Birney was thrown to\r\nTyler's right and Crawford to his left, with Gibbon as a reserve; and\r\nEwell was whirled back speedily and with heavy loss.\r\n\r\nWarren had been ordered to get on Ewell's flank and in his rear, to cut\r\nhim off from his intrenchments.  But his efforts were so feeble that\r\nunder the cover of night Ewell got back with only the loss of a few\r\nhundred prisoners, besides his killed and wounded.  The army being\r\nengaged until after dark, I rescinded the order for the march by our\r\nleft flank that night.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was discovered that the enemy were coming out to attack, I\r\nnaturally supposed they would detach a force to destroy our trains.  The\r\nwithdrawal of Hancock from the right uncovered one road from\r\nSpottsylvania to Fredericksburg over which trains drew our supplies.\r\nThis was guarded by a division of colored troops, commanded by General\r\nFerrero, belonging to Burnside's corps.  Ferrero was therefore promptly\r\nnotified, and ordered to throw his cavalry pickets out to the south and\r\nbe prepared to meet the enemy if he should come; if he had to retreat to\r\ndo so towards Fredericksburg.  The enemy did detach as expected, and\r\ncaptured twenty-five or thirty wagons which, however, were soon retaken.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the disasters that had befallen us in the past few\r\ndays, Lee could be reinforced largely, and I had no doubt he would be.\r\nBeauregard had come up from the south with troops to guard the\r\nConfederate capital when it was in danger.  Butler being driven back,\r\nmost of the troops could be sent to Lee. Hoke was no longer needed in\r\nNorth Carolina; and Sigel's troops having gone back to Cedar Creek,\r\nwhipped, many troops could be spared from the valley.\r\n\r\nThe Wilderness and Spottsylvania battles convinced me that we had more\r\nartillery than could ever be brought into action at any one time.  It\r\noccupied much of the road in marching, and taxed the trains in bringing\r\nup forage.  Artillery is very useful when it can be brought into action,\r\nbut it is a very burdensome luxury where it cannot be used.  Before\r\nleaving Spottsylvania, therefore, I sent back to the defences of\r\nWashington over one hundred pieces of artillery, with the horses and\r\ncaissons.  This relieved the roads over which we were to march of more\r\nthan two hundred six-horse teams, and still left us more artillery than\r\ncould be advantageously used.  In fact, before reaching the James River\r\nI again reduced the artillery with the army largely.\r\n\r\nI believed that, if one corps of the army was exposed on the road to\r\nRichmond, and at a distance from the main army, Lee would endeavor to\r\nattack the exposed corps before reinforcements could come up; in which\r\ncase the main army could follow Lee up and attack him before he had time\r\nto intrench.  So I issued the following orders:\r\n\r\n\r\nNEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H., VA., May 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nBefore daylight to-morrow morning I propose to draw Hancock and Burnside\r\nfrom the position they now hold, and put Burnside to the left of Wright.\r\nWright and Burnside should then force their way up as close to the enemy\r\nas they can get without a general engagement, or with a general\r\nengagement if the enemy will come out of their works to fight, and\r\nintrench.  Hancock should march and take up a position as if in support\r\nof the two left corps. To-morrow night, at twelve or one o'clock, he\r\nwill be moved south-east with all his force and as much cavalry as can\r\nbe given to him, to get as far towards Richmond on the line of the\r\nFredericksburg Railroad as he can make, fighting the enemy in whatever\r\nforce he can find him.  If the enemy make a general move to meet this,\r\nthey will be followed by the other three corps of the army, and\r\nattacked, if possible, before time is given to intrench.\r\n\r\nSuitable directions will at once be given for all trains and surplus\r\nartillery to conform to this movement.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, Lee showing no signs of coming out of his lines, orders\r\nwere renewed for a left-flank movement, to commence after night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT BY THE LEFT FLANK--BATTLE OF NORTH ANNA--AN INCIDENT OF THE\r\nMARCH--MOVING ON RICHMOND--SOUTH OF THE PAMUNKEY--POSITION OF THE\r\nNATIONAL ARMY.\r\n\r\nWe were now to operate in a different country from any we had before\r\nseen in Virginia.  The roads were wide and good, and the country well\r\ncultivated.  No men were seen except those bearing arms, even the black\r\nman having been sent away.  The country, however, was new to us, and we\r\nhad neither guides nor maps to tell us where the roads were, or where\r\nthey led to.  Engineer and staff officers were put to the dangerous duty\r\nof supplying the place of both maps and guides.  By reconnoitring they\r\nwere enabled to locate the roads in the vicinity of each army corps.\r\nOur course was south, and we took all roads leading in that direction\r\nwhich would not separate the army too widely.\r\n\r\nHancock who had the lead had marched easterly to Guiney's Station, on\r\nthe Fredericksburg Railroad, thence southerly to Bowling Green and\r\nMilford.  He was at Milford by the night of the 21st.  Here he met a\r\ndetachment of Pickett's division coming from Richmond to reinforce Lee.\r\nThey were speedily driven away, and several hundred captured.  Warren\r\nfollowed on the morning of the 21st, and reached Guiney's Station that\r\nnight without molestation.  Burnside and Wright were retained at\r\nSpottsylvania to keep up the appearance of an intended assault, and to\r\nhold Lee, if possible, while Hancock and Warren should get start enough\r\nto interpose between him and Richmond.\r\n\r\nLee had now a superb opportunity to take the initiative either by\r\nattacking Wright and Burnside alone, or by following by the Telegraph\r\nRoad and striking Hancock's and Warren's corps, or even Hancock's alone,\r\nbefore reinforcements could come up.  But he did not avail himself of\r\neither opportunity.  He seemed really to be misled as to my designs; but\r\nmoved by his interior line--the Telegraph Road--to make sure of keeping\r\nbetween his capital and the Army of the Potomac.  He never again had\r\nsuch an opportunity of dealing a heavy blow.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the 21st Burnside, 9th corps, moved out followed by\r\nWright, 6th corps.  Burnside was to take the Telegraph Road; but finding\r\nStanard's Ford, over the Po, fortified and guarded, he turned east to\r\nthe road taken by Hancock and Warren without an attempt to dislodge the\r\nenemy.  The night of the 21st I had my headquarters near the 6th corps,\r\nat Guiney's Station, and the enemy's cavalry was between us and Hancock.\r\nThere was a slight attack on Burnside's and Wright's corps as they moved\r\nout of their lines; but it was easily repulsed.  The object probably was\r\nonly to make sure that we were not leaving a force to follow upon the\r\nrear of the Confederates.\r\n\r\nBy the morning of the 22d Burnside and Wright were at Guiney's Station.\r\nHancock's corps had now been marching and fighting continuously for\r\nseveral days, not having had rest even at night much of the time.  They\r\nwere, therefore, permitted to rest during the 22d.  But Warren was\r\npushed to Harris's Store, directly west of Milford, and connected with\r\nit by a good road, and Burnside was sent to New Bethel Church.  Wright's\r\ncorps was still back at Guiney's Station.\r\n\r\nI issued the following order for the movement of the troops the next\r\nday:\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW BETHEL, VA., May 22, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nDirect corps commanders to hold their troops in readiness to march at\r\nfive A.M. to-morrow.  At that hour each command will send out cavalry\r\nand infantry on all roads to their front leading south, and ascertain,\r\nif possible, where the enemy is. If beyond the South Anna, the 5th and\r\n6th corps will march to the forks of the road, where one branch leads to\r\nBeaver Dam Station, the other to Jericho Bridge, then south by roads\r\nreaching the Anna, as near to and east of Hawkins Creek as they can be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe 2d corps will move to Chesterfield Ford.  The 9th corps will be\r\ndirected to move at the same time to Jericho Bridge.  The map only shows\r\ntwo roads for the four corps to march upon, but, no doubt, by the use of\r\nplantation roads, and pressing in guides, others can be found, to give\r\none for each corps.\r\n\r\nThe troops will follow their respective reconnoitring parties. The\r\ntrains will be moved at the same time to Milford Station.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters will follow the 9th corps.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarren's corps was moved from Harris's Store to Jericho Ford, Wright's\r\nfollowing.  Warren arrived at the ford early in the afternoon, and by\r\nfive o'clock effected a crossing under the protection of sharpshooters.\r\nThe men had to wade in water up to their waists.  As soon as enough\r\ntroops were over to guard the ford, pontoons were laid and the artillery\r\nand the rest of the troops crossed.  The line formed was almost\r\nperpendicular to the course of the river--Crawford on the left, next to\r\nthe river, Griffin in the centre, and Cutler on the right.  Lee was\r\nfound intrenched along the front of their line.  The whole of Hill's\r\ncorps was sent against Warren's right before it had got in position.  A\r\nbrigade of Cutler's division was driven back, the enemy following, but\r\nassistance coming up the enemy was in turn driven back into his trenches\r\nwith heavy loss in killed and wounded, with about five hundred prisoners\r\nleft in our hands. By night Wright's corps was up ready to reinforce\r\nWarren.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d Hancock's corps was moved to the wooden bridge which spans\r\nthe North Anna River just west of where the Fredericksburg Railroad\r\ncrosses.  It was near night when the troops arrived. They found the\r\nbridge guarded, with troops intrenched, on the north side.  Hancock sent\r\ntwo brigades, Egan's and Pierce's, to the right and left, and when\r\nproperly disposed they charged simultaneously.  The bridge was carried\r\nquickly, the enemy retreating over it so hastily that many were shoved\r\ninto the river, and some of them were drowned.  Several hundred\r\nprisoners were captured.  The hour was so late that Hancock did not\r\ncross until next morning.\r\n\r\nBurnside's corps was moved by a middle road running between those\r\ndescribed above, and which strikes the North Anna at Ox Ford, midway\r\nbetween Telegraph Road and Jericho Ford.  The hour of its arrival was\r\ntoo late to cross that night.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th Hancock's corps crossed to the south side of the river\r\nwithout opposition, and formed line facing nearly west. The railroad in\r\nrear was taken possession of and destroyed as far as possible.  Wright's\r\ncorps crossed at Jericho early the same day, and took position to the\r\nright of Warren's corps, extending south of the Virginia Central\r\nRailroad.  This road was torn up for a considerable distance to the rear\r\n(west), the ties burned, and the rails bent and twisted by heating them\r\nover the burning ties.  It was found, however, that Burnside's corps\r\ncould not cross at Ox Ford.  Lee had taken a position with his centre on\r\nthe river at this point, with the two wings thrown back, his line making\r\nan acute angle where it overlooked the river.\r\n\r\nBefore the exact position of the whole of Lee's line was accurately\r\nknown, I directed Hancock and Warren each to send a brigade to Ox Ford\r\nby the south side of the river.  They found the enemy too strong to\r\njustify a serious attack.  A third ford was found between Ox Ford and\r\nJericho.  Burnside was directed to cross a division over this ford, and\r\nto send one division to Hancock.  Crittenden was crossed by this\r\nnewly-discovered ford, and formed up the river to connect with\r\nCrawford's left.  Potter joined Hancock by way of the wooden bridge.\r\nCrittenden had a severe engagement with some of Hill's corps on his\r\ncrossing the river, and lost heavily.  When joined to Warren's corps he\r\nwas no further molested.  Burnside still guarded Ox Ford from the north\r\nside.\r\n\r\nLee now had his entire army south of the North Anna.  Our lines covered\r\nhis front, with the six miles separating the two wings guarded by but a\r\nsingle division.  To get from one wing to the other the river would have\r\nto be crossed twice.  Lee could reinforce any part of his line from all\r\npoints of it in a very short march; or could concentrate the whole of it\r\nwherever he might choose to assault.  We were, for the time, practically\r\ntwo armies besieging.\r\n\r\nLee had been reinforced, and was being reinforced, largely. About this\r\ntime the very troops whose coming I had predicted, had arrived or were\r\ncoming in.  Pickett with a full division from Richmond was up; Hoke from\r\nNorth Carolina had come with a brigade; and Breckinridge was there:  in\r\nall probably not less than fifteen thousand men.  But he did not attempt\r\nto drive us from the field.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d or 23d I received dispatches from Washington saying that\r\nSherman had taken Kingston, crossed the Etowah River and was advancing\r\ninto Georgia.\r\n\r\nI was seated at the time on the porch of a fine plantation house waiting\r\nfor Burnside's corps to pass.  Meade and his staff, besides my own\r\nstaff, were with me.  The lady of the house, a Mrs. Tyler, and an\r\nelderly lady, were present.  Burnside seeing us, came up on the porch,\r\nhis big spurs and saber rattling as he walked.  He touched his hat\r\npolitely to the ladies, and remarked that he supposed they had never\r\nseen so many \"live Yankees\" before in their lives.  The elderly lady\r\nspoke up promptly saying, \"Oh yes, I have; many more.\"  \"Where?\" said\r\nBurnside. \"In Richmond.\"  Prisoners, of course, was understood.\r\n\r\nI read my dispatch aloud, when it was received.  This threw the younger\r\nlady into tears. I found the information she had received (and I suppose\r\nit was the information generally in circulation through the South) was\r\nthat Lee was driving us from the State in the most demoralized condition\r\nand that in the South-west our troops were but little better than\r\nprisoners of war.  Seeing our troops moving south was ocular proof that\r\na part of her information was incorrect, and she asked me if my news\r\nfrom Sherman was true.  I assured her that there was no doubt about it.\r\nI left a guard to protect the house from intrusion until the troops\r\nshould have all passed, and assured her that if her husband was in\r\nhiding she could bring him in and he should be protected also.  But I\r\npresume he was in the Confederate army.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th I gave orders, through Halleck, to Hunter, who had relieved\r\nSigel, to move up the Valley of Virginia, cross over the Blue Ridge to\r\nCharlottesville and go as far as Lynchburg if possible, living upon the\r\ncountry and cutting the railroads and canal as he went.  After doing\r\nthis he could find his way back to his base, or join me.\r\n\r\nOn the same day news was received that Lee was falling back on Richmond.\r\nThis proved not to be true.  But we could do nothing where we were\r\nunless Lee would assume the offensive. I determined, therefore, to draw\r\nout of our present position and make one more effort to get between him\r\nand Richmond.  I had no expectation now, however, of succeeding in this;\r\nbut I did expect to hold him far enough west to enable me to reach the\r\nJames River high up.  Sheridan was now again with the Army of the\r\nPotomac.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th I informed the government at Washington of the position of\r\nthe two armies; of the reinforcements the enemy had received; of the\r\nmove I proposed to make (*32); and directed that our base of supplies\r\nshould be shifted to White House, on the Pamunkey.  The wagon train and\r\nguards moved directly from Port Royal to White House.  Supplies moved\r\naround by water, guarded by the navy.  Orders had previously been sent,\r\nthrough Halleck, for Butler to send Smith's corps to White House.  This\r\norder was repeated on the 25th, with directions that they should be\r\nlanded on the north side of the Pamunkey, and marched until they joined\r\nthe Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nIt was a delicate move to get the right wing of the Army of the Potomac\r\nfrom its position south of the North Anna in the presence of the enemy.\r\nTo accomplish it, I issued the following order:\r\n\r\n\r\nQUARLES' MILLS, VA., May 25, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR GENERAL MEADE, Commanding A. P.\r\n\r\nDirect Generals Warren and Wright to withdraw all their teams and\r\nartillery, not in position, to the north side of the river to-morrow.\r\nSend that belonging to General Wright's corps as far on the road to\r\nHanover Town as it can go, without attracting attention to the fact.\r\nSend with it Wright's best division or division under his ablest\r\ncommander.  Have their places filled up in the line so if possible the\r\nenemy will not notice their withdrawal.  Send the cavalry to-morrow\r\nafternoon, or as much of it as you may deem necessary, to watch and\r\nseize, if they can, Littlepage's Bridge and Taylor's Ford, and to remain\r\non one or other side of the river at these points until the infantry and\r\nartillery all pass.  As soon as it is dark to-morrow night start the\r\ndivision which you withdraw first from Wright's corps to make a forced\r\nmarch to Hanover Town, taking with them no teams to impede their march.\r\nAt the same time this division starts commence withdrawing all of the\r\n5th and 6th corps from the south side of the river, and march them for\r\nthe same place.  The two divisions of the 9th corps not now with\r\nHancock, may be moved down the north bank of the river where they will\r\nbe handy to support Hancock if necessary, or will be that much on their\r\nroad to follow the 5th and 6th corps.  Hancock should hold his command\r\nin readiness to follow as soon as the way is clear for him. To-morrow it\r\nwill leave nothing for him to do, but as soon as he can he should get\r\nall his teams and spare artillery on the road or roads which he will\r\nhave to take.  As soon as the troops reach Hanover Town they should get\r\npossession of all the crossings they can in that neighborhood.  I think\r\nit would be well to make a heavy cavalry demonstration on the enemy's\r\nleft, to-morrow afternoon, also.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilson's division of cavalry was brought up from the left and moved by\r\nour right south to Little River.  Here he manoeuvred to give the\r\nimpression that we were going to attack the left flank of Lee's army.\r\n\r\nUnder cover of night our right wing was withdrawn to the north side of\r\nthe river, Lee being completely deceived by Wilson's feint.  On the\r\nafternoon of the 26th Sheridan moved, sending Gregg's and Torbert's\r\ncavalry to Taylor's and Littlepage's fords towards Hanover.  As soon as\r\nit was dark both divisions moved quietly to Hanover Ferry, leaving small\r\nguards behind to keep up the impression that crossings were to be\r\nattempted in the morning.  Sheridan was followed by a division of\r\ninfantry under General Russell.  On the morning of the 27th the crossing\r\nwas effected with but little loss, the enemy losing thirty or forty,\r\ntaken prisoners.  Thus a position was secured south of the Pamunkey.\r\n\r\nRussell stopped at the crossing while the cavalry pushed on to Hanover\r\nTown.  Here Barringer's, formerly Gordon's, brigade of rebel cavalry was\r\nencountered, but it was speedily driven away.\r\n\r\nWarren's and Wright's corps were moved by the rear of Burnside's and\r\nHancock's corps.  When out of the way these latter corps followed,\r\nleaving pickets confronting the enemy.  Wilson's cavalry followed last,\r\nwatching all the fords until everything had recrossed; then taking up\r\nthe pontoons and destroying other bridges, became the rear-guard.\r\n\r\nTwo roads were traversed by the troops in this move.  The one nearest to\r\nand north of the North Anna and Pamunkey was taken by Wright, followed\r\nby Hancock.  Warren, followed by Burnside, moved by a road farther\r\nnorth, and longer.  The trains moved by a road still farther north, and\r\nhad to travel a still greater distance.  All the troops that had crossed\r\nthe Pamunkey on the morning of the 27th remained quiet during the rest\r\nof the day, while the troops north of that stream marched to reach the\r\ncrossing that had been secured for them.\r\n\r\nLee had evidently been deceived by our movement from North Anna; for on\r\nthe morning of the 27th he telegraphed to Richmond: \"Enemy crossed to\r\nnorth side, and cavalry and infantry crossed at Hanover Town.\"  The\r\ntroops that had then crossed left his front the night of the 25th.\r\n\r\nThe country we were now in was a difficult one to move troops over.  The\r\nstreams were numerous, deep and sluggish, sometimes spreading out into\r\nswamps grown up with impenetrable growths of trees and underbrush.  The\r\nbanks were generally low and marshy, making the streams difficult to\r\napproach except where there were roads and bridges.\r\n\r\nHanover Town is about twenty miles from Richmond.  There are two roads\r\nleading there; the most direct and shortest one crossing the\r\nChickahominy at Meadow Bridge, near the Virginia Central Railroad, the\r\nsecond going by New and Old Cold Harbor.  A few miles out from Hanover\r\nTown there is a third road by way of Mechanicsville to Richmond.  New\r\nCold Harbor was important to us because while there we both covered the\r\nroads back to White House (where our supplies came from), and the roads\r\nsouth-east over which we would have to pass to get to the James River\r\nbelow the Richmond defences.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 28th the army made an early start, and by noon all\r\nhad crossed except Burnside's corps.  This was left on the north side\r\ntemporarily to guard the large wagon train.  A line was at once formed\r\nextending south from the river, Wright's corps on the right, Hancock's\r\nin the centre, and Warren's on the left, ready to meet the enemy if he\r\nshould come.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Sheridan was directed to reconnoitre towards\r\nMechanicsville to find Lee's position.  At Hawes' Shop, just where the\r\nmiddle road leaves the direct road to Richmond, he encountered the\r\nConfederate cavalry dismounted and partially intrenched.  Gregg attacked\r\nwith his division, but was unable to move the enemy.  In the evening\r\nCuster came up with a brigade. The attack was now renewed, the cavalry\r\ndismounting and charging as infantry.  This time the assault was\r\nsuccessful, both sides losing a considerable number of men.  But our\r\ntroops had to bury the dead, and found that more Confederate than Union\r\nsoldiers had been killed.  The position was easily held, because our\r\ninfantry was near.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th a reconnoissance was made in force, to find the position of\r\nLee.  Wright's corps pushed to Hanover Court House.  Hancock's corps\r\npushed toward Totopotomoy Creek; Warren's corps to the left on the Shady\r\nGrove Church Road, while Burnside was held in reserve. Our advance was\r\npushed forward three miles on the left with but little fighting.  There\r\nwas now an appearance of a movement past our left flank, and Sheridan\r\nwas sent to meet it.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th Hancock moved to the Totopotomoy, where he found the enemy\r\nstrongly fortified.  Wright was moved to the right of Hancock's corps,\r\nand Burnside was brought forward and crossed, taking position to the\r\nleft of Hancock.  Warren moved up near Huntley Corners on the Shady\r\nGrove Church Road.  There was some skirmishing along the centre, and in\r\nthe evening Early attacked Warren with some vigor, driving him back at\r\nfirst, and threatening to turn our left flank.  As the best means of\r\nreinforcing the left, Hancock was ordered to attack in his front.  He\r\ncarried and held the rifle-pits.  While this was going on Warren got his\r\nmen up, repulsed Early, and drove him more than a mile.\r\n\r\nOn this day I wrote to Halleck ordering all the pontoons in Washington\r\nto be sent to City Point.\r\n\r\nIn the evening news was received of the arrival of Smith with his corps\r\nat White House.  I notified Meade, in writing, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nNEAR HAWES' SHOP, VA., 6.40 P.M., May 30, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Commanding A. P.\r\n\r\nGeneral Smith will debark his force at the White House tonight and start\r\nup the south bank of the Pamunkey at an early hour, probably at 3 A.M.\r\nin the morning.  It is not improbable that the enemy, being aware of\r\nSmith's movement, will be feeling to get on our left flank for the\r\npurpose of cutting him off, or by a dash to crush him and get back\r\nbefore we are aware of it. Sheridan ought to be notified to watch the\r\nenemy's movements well out towards Cold Harbor, and also on the\r\nMechanicsville road.  Wright should be got well massed on Hancock's\r\nright, so that, if it becomes necessary, he can take the place of the\r\nlatter readily whilst troops are being thrown east of the Totopotomoy if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nI want Sheridan to send a cavalry force of at least half a brigade, if\r\nnot a whole brigade, at 5 A.M. in the morning, to communicate with Smith\r\nand to return with him.  I will send orders for Smith by the messenger\r\nyou send to Sheridan with his orders.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also notified Smith of his danger, and the precautions that would be\r\ntaken to protect him.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 30th Lee's position was substantially from Atlee's\r\nStation on the Virginia Central Railroad south and east to the vicinity\r\nof Cold Harbor.  Ours was:  The left of Warren's corps was on the Shady\r\nGrove Road, extending to the Mechanicsville Road and about three miles\r\nsouth of the Totopotomoy.  Burnside to his right, then Hancock, and\r\nWright on the extreme right, extending towards Hanover Court House, six\r\nmiles south-east of it.  Sheridan with two divisions of cavalry was\r\nwatching our left front towards Cold Harbor.  Wilson with his division\r\non our right was sent to get on the Virginia Central Railroad and\r\ndestroy it as far back as possible.  He got possession of Hanover Court\r\nHouse the next day after a skirmish with Young's cavalry brigade.  The\r\nenemy attacked Sheridan's pickets, but reinforcements were sent up and\r\nthe attack was speedily repulsed and the enemy followed some distance\r\ntowards Cold Harbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nADVANCE ON COLD HARBOR--AN ANECDOTE OF THE WAR--BATTLE OF COLD HARBOR\r\n--CORRESPONDENCE WITH LEE--RETROSPECTIVE.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st Sheridan advanced to near Old Cold Harbor.  He found it\r\nintrenched and occupied by cavalry and infantry.  A hard fight ensued\r\nbut the place was carried.  The enemy well knew the importance of Cold\r\nHarbor to us, and seemed determined that we should not hold it.  He\r\nreturned with such a large force that Sheridan was about withdrawing\r\nwithout making any effort to hold it against such odds; but about the\r\ntime he commenced the evacuation he received orders to hold the place at\r\nall hazards, until reinforcements could be sent to him.  He speedily\r\nturned the rebel works to face against them and placed his men in\r\nposition for defence.  Night came on before the enemy was ready for\r\nassault.\r\n\r\nWright's corps was ordered early in the evening to march directly to\r\nCold Harbor passing by the rear of the army.  It was expected to arrive\r\nby daylight or before; but the night was dark and the distance great, so\r\nthat it was nine o'clock the 1st of June before it reached its\r\ndestination.  Before the arrival of Wright the enemy had made two\r\nassaults on Sheridan, both of which were repulsed with heavy loss to the\r\nenemy.  Wright's corps coming up, there was no further assault on Cold\r\nHarbor.\r\n\r\nSmith, who was coming up from White House, was also directed to march\r\ndirectly to Cold Harbor, and was expected early on the morning of the\r\n1st of June; but by some blunder the order which reached Smith directed\r\nhim to Newcastle instead of Cold Harbor.  Through this blunder Smith did\r\nnot reach his destination until three o'clock in the afternoon, and then\r\nwith tired and worn-out men from their long and dusty march.  He landed\r\ntwelve thousand five hundred men from Butler's command, but a division\r\nwas left at White House temporarily and many men had fallen out of ranks\r\nin their long march.\r\n\r\nBefore the removal of Wright's corps from our right, after dark on the\r\n31st, the two lines, Federal and Confederate, were so close together at\r\nthat point that either side could detect directly any movement made by\r\nthe other.  Finding at daylight that Wright had left his front, Lee\r\nevidently divined that he had gone to our left.  At all events, soon\r\nafter light on the 1st of June Anderson, who commanded the corps on\r\nLee's left, was seen moving along Warren's front.  Warren was ordered to\r\nattack him vigorously in flank, while Wright was directed to move out\r\nand get on his front.  Warren fired his artillery at the enemy; but lost\r\nso much time in making ready that the enemy got by, and at three o'clock\r\nhe reported the enemy was strongly intrenched in his front, and besides\r\nhis lines were so long that he had no mass of troops to move with.  He\r\nseemed to have forgotten that lines in rear of an army hold themselves\r\nwhile their defenders are fighting in their front.  Wright reconnoitred\r\nsome distance to his front:  but the enemy finding Old Cold Harbor\r\nalready taken had halted and fortified some distance west.\r\n\r\nBy six o'clock in the afternoon Wright and Smith were ready to make an\r\nassault.  In front of both the ground was clear for several hundred\r\nyards and then became wooded.  Both charged across this open space and\r\ninto the wood, capturing and holding the first line of rifle-pits of the\r\nenemy, and also capturing seven or eight hundred prisoners.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, the enemy charged Warren three separate times\r\nwith vigor, but were repulsed each time with loss.  There was no officer\r\nmore capable, nor one more prompt in acting, than Warren when the enemy\r\nforced him to it.  There was also an attack upon Hancock's and\r\nBurnside's corps at the same time; but it was feeble and probably only\r\nintended to relieve Anderson who was being pressed by Wright and Smith.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the enemy made frequent attacks with the view of\r\ndispossessing us of the important position we had gained, but without\r\neffecting their object.\r\n\r\nHancock was moved from his place in line during the night and ordered to\r\nthe left of Wright.  I expected to take the offensive on the morning of\r\nthe 2d, but the night was so dark, the heat and dust so excessive and\r\nthe roads so intricate and hard to keep, that the head of column only\r\nreached Old Cold Harbor at six o'clock, but was in position at 7.30 A.M.\r\nPreparations were made for an attack in the afternoon, but did not take\r\nplace until the next morning.  Warren's corps was moved to the left to\r\nconnect with Smith:  Hancock's corps was got into position to the left\r\nof Wright's, and Burnside was moved to Bethesda Church in reserve. While\r\nWarren and Burnside were making these changes the enemy came out several\r\ntimes and attacked them, capturing several hundred prisoners.  The\r\nattacks were repulsed, but not followed up as they should have been.  I\r\nwas so annoyed at this that I directed Meade to instruct his corps\r\ncommanders that they should seize all such opportunities when they\r\noccurred, and not wait for orders, all of our manoeuvres being made for\r\nthe very purpose of getting the enemy out of his cover.\r\n\r\nOn this day Wilson returned from his raid upon the Virginia Central\r\nRailroad, having damaged it considerably.  But, like ourselves, the\r\nrebels had become experts in repairing such damage.  Sherman, in his\r\nmemoirs, relates an anecdote of his campaign to Atlanta that well\r\nillustrates this point.  The rebel cavalry lurking in his rear to burn\r\nbridges and obstruct his communications had become so disgusted at\r\nhearing trains go whistling by within a few hours after a bridge had\r\nbeen burned, that they proposed to try blowing up some of the tunnels.\r\nOne of them said, \"No use, boys, Old Sherman carries duplicate tunnels\r\nwith him, and will replace them as fast as you can blow them up; better\r\nsave your powder.\"\r\n\r\nSheridan was engaged reconnoitring the banks of the Chickahominy, to\r\nfind crossings and the condition of the roads.  He reported favorably.\r\n\r\nDuring the night Lee moved his left up to make his line correspond to\r\nours.  His lines extended now from the Totopotomoy to New Cold Harbor.\r\nMine from Bethesda Church by Old Cold Harbor to the Chickahominy, with a\r\ndivision of cavalry guarding our right.  An assault was ordered for the\r\n3d, to be made mainly by the corps of Hancock, Wright and Smith; but\r\nWarren and Burnside were to support it by threatening Lee's left, and to\r\nattack with great earnestness if he should either reinforce more\r\nthreatened points by drawing from that quarter or if a favorable\r\nopportunity should present itself.\r\n\r\nThe corps commanders were to select the points in their respective\r\nfronts where they would make their assaults.  The move was to commence\r\nat half-past four in the morning.  Hancock sent Barlow and Gibbon\r\nforward at the appointed hour, with Birney as a reserve.  Barlow pushed\r\nforward with great vigor, under a heavy fire of both artillery and\r\nmusketry, through thickets and swamps.  Notwithstanding all the\r\nresistance of the enemy and the natural obstructions to overcome, he\r\ncarried a position occupied by the enemy outside their main line where\r\nthe road makes a deep cut through a bank affording as good a shelter for\r\ntroops as if it had been made for that purpose.  Three pieces of\r\nartillery had been captured here, and several hundred prisoners.  The\r\nguns were immediately turned against the men who had just been using\r\nthem.  No (*33) assistance coming to him, he (Barlow) intrenched under\r\nfire and continued to hold his place.  Gibbon was not so fortunate in\r\nhis front.  He found the ground over which he had to pass cut up with\r\ndeep ravines, and a morass difficult to cross.  But his men struggled on\r\nuntil some of them got up to the very parapet covering the enemy.\r\nGibbon gained ground much nearer the enemy than that which he left, and\r\nhere he intrenched and held fast.\r\n\r\nWright's corps moving in two lines captured the outer rifle-pits in\r\ntheir front, but accomplished nothing more.  Smith's corps also gained\r\nthe outer rifle-pits in its front.  The ground over which this corps\r\n(18th) had to move was the most exposed of any over which charges were\r\nmade.  An open plain intervened between the contending forces at this\r\npoint, which was exposed both to a direct and a cross fire.  Smith,\r\nhowever, finding a ravine running towards his front, sufficiently deep\r\nto protect men in it from cross fire, and somewhat from a direct fire,\r\nput Martindale's division in it, and with Brooks supporting him on the\r\nleft and Devens on the right succeeded in gaining the outer--probably\r\npicket--rifle-pits.  Warren and Burnside also advanced and gained\r\nground--which brought the whole army on one line.\r\n\r\nThis assault cost us heavily and probably without benefit to compensate:\r\nbut the enemy was not cheered by the occurrence sufficiently to induce\r\nhim to take the offensive.  In fact, nowhere after the battle of the\r\nWilderness did Lee show any disposition to leave his defences far behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFighting was substantially over by half-past seven in the morning.  At\r\neleven o'clock I started to visit all the corps commanders to see for\r\nmyself the different positions gained and to get their opinion of the\r\npracticability of doing anything more in their respective fronts.\r\n\r\nHancock gave the opinion that in his front the enemy was too strong to\r\nmake any further assault promise success.  Wright thought he could gain\r\nthe lines of the enemy, but it would require the cooperation of\r\nHancock's and Smith's corps.  Smith thought a lodgment possible, but was\r\nnot sanguine:  Burnside thought something could be done in his front,\r\nbut Warren differed.  I concluded, therefore to make no more assaults,\r\nand a little after twelve directed in the following letter that all\r\noffensive action should cease.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD HARBOR, June 3, 1864.-12.30 P.M. MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,\r\n\r\nCommanding A. P.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of corps commanders not being sanguine of success in case an\r\nassault is ordered, you may direct a suspension of farther advance for\r\nthe present.  Hold our most advanced positions and strengthen them.\r\nWhilst on the defensive our line may be contracted from the right if\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nReconnoissances should be made in front of every corps and advances made\r\nto advantageous positions by regular approaches. To aid the expedition\r\nunder General Hunter it is necessary that we should detain all the army\r\nnow with Lee until the former gets well on his way to Lynchburg.  To do\r\nthis effectually it will be better to keep the enemy out of the\r\nintrenchments of Richmond than to have them go back there.\r\n\r\nWright and Hancock should be ready to assault in case the enemy should\r\nbreak through General Smith's lines, and all should be ready to resist\r\nan assault.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the day was spent in strengthening the line we now\r\nheld.  By night we were as strong against Lee as he was against us.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the enemy quitted our right front, abandoning some of\r\ntheir wounded, and without burying their dead.  These we were able to\r\ncare for.  But there were many dead and wounded men between the lines of\r\nthe contending forces, which were now close together, who could not be\r\ncared for without a cessation of hostilities.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD HARBOR, VA., June 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL R.  E. LEE, Commanding Confederate Army.\r\n\r\nIt is reported to me that there are wounded men, probably of both\r\narmies, now lying exposed and suffering between the lines occupied\r\nrespectively by the two armies.  Humanity would dictate that some\r\nprovision should be made to provide against such hardships.  I would\r\npropose, therefore, that hereafter, when no battle is raging, either\r\nparty be authorized to send to any point between the pickets or skirmish\r\nlines, unarmed men bearing litters to pick up their dead or wounded,\r\nwithout being fired upon by the other party.  Any other method, equally\r\nfair to both parties, you may propose for meeting the end desired will\r\nbe accepted by me.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nLee replied that he feared such an arrangement would lead to\r\nmisunderstanding, and proposed that in future, when either party wished\r\nto remove their dead and wounded, a flag of truce be sent.  I answered\r\nthis immediately by saying:\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD HARBOR, VA., June 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding Army of N. Va.\r\n\r\nYour communication of yesterday's date is received.  I will send\r\nimmediately, as you propose, to collect the dead and wounded between the\r\nlines of the two armies, and will also instruct that you be allowed to\r\ndo the same.  I propose that the time for doing this be between the\r\nhours of 12 M. and 3 P.M. to-day.  I will direct all parties going out\r\nto bear a white flag, and not to attempt to go beyond where we have dead\r\nor wounded, and not beyond or on ground occupied by your troops.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nLee's response was that he could not consent to the burial of the dead\r\nand removal of the wounded in the way I proposed, but when either party\r\ndesired such permission it should be asked for by flag of truce and he\r\nhad directed that any parties I may have sent out, as mentioned in my\r\nletter, to be turned back.  I answered:\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD HARBOR, VA, June 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL R. E. LEE. Commanding Army, N. Va.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge that wounded men are now suffering from want of attention,\r\nbetween the two armies, compels me to ask a suspension of hostilities\r\nfor sufficient time to collect them in, say two hours.  Permit me to say\r\nthat the hours you may fix upon for this will be agreeable to me, and\r\nthe same privilege will be extended to such parties as you may wish to\r\nsend out on the same duty without further application.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nLee acceded to this; but delays in transmitting the correspondence\r\nbrought it to the 7th of June--forty-eight hours after it commenced\r\n--before parties were got out to collect the men left upon the field.\r\nIn the meantime all but two of the wounded had died.  And I wrote to\r\nLee:\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD HARBOR, VA., June 7, 1864. 10.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nGEN. R. E. LEE, Commanding Army of N. Va.\r\n\r\nI regret that your note of seven P.M. yesterday should have been\r\nreceived at the nearest corps headquarters, to where it was delivered,\r\nafter the hour which had been given for the removal of the dead and\r\nwounded had expired; 10.45 P.M. was the hour at which it was received at\r\ncorps headquarters, and between eleven and twelve it reached my\r\nheadquarters.  As a consequence, it was not understood by the troops of\r\nthis army that there was a cessation of hostilities for the purpose of\r\ncollecting the dead and wounded, and none were collected.  Two officers\r\nand six men of the 8th and 25th North Carolina Regts., who were out in\r\nsearch of the bodies of officers of their respective regiments, were\r\ncaptured and brought into our lines, owing to this want of\r\nunderstanding.  I regret this, but will state that as soon as I learned\r\nthe fact, I directed that they should not be held as prisoners, but must\r\nbe returned to their commands.  These officers and men having been\r\ncarelessly brought through our lines to the rear have not determined\r\nwhether they will be sent back the way they came, or whether they will\r\nbe sent by some other route.\r\n\r\nRegretting that all my efforts for alleviating the sufferings of wounded\r\nmen left upon the battle-field have been rendered nugatory, I remain,\r\n&c.,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever\r\nmade.  I might say the same thing of the assault of the 22d of May,\r\n1863, at Vicksburg.  At Cold Harbor no advantage whatever was gained to\r\ncompensate for the heavy loss we sustained.  Indeed, the advantages\r\nother than those of relative losses, were on the Confederate side.\r\nBefore that, the Army of Northern Virginia seemed to have acquired a\r\nwholesome regard for the courage, endurance, and soldierly qualities\r\ngenerally of the Army of the Potomac.  They no longer wanted to fight\r\nthem \"one Confederate to five Yanks.\"  Indeed, they seemed to have given\r\nup any idea of gaining any advantage of their antagonist in the open\r\nfield.  They had come to much prefer breastworks in their front to the\r\nArmy of the Potomac.  This charge seemed to revive their hopes\r\ntemporarily; but it was of short duration.  The effect upon the Army of\r\nthe Potomac was the reverse.  When we reached the James River, however,\r\nall effects of the battle of Cold Harbor seemed to have disappeared.\r\n\r\nThere was more justification for the assault at Vicksburg.  We were in a\r\nSouthern climate, at the beginning of the hot season.  The Army of the\r\nTennessee had won five successive victories over the garrison of\r\nVicksburg in the three preceding weeks.  They had driven a portion of\r\nthat army from Port Gibson with considerable loss, after having flanked\r\nthem out of their stronghold at Grand Gulf.  They had attacked another\r\nportion of the same army at Raymond, more than fifty miles farther in\r\nthe interior of the State, and driven them back into Jackson with great\r\nloss in killed, wounded, captured and missing, besides loss of large and\r\nsmall arms:  they had captured the capital of the State of Mississippi,\r\nwith a large amount of materials of war and manufactures.  Only a few\r\ndays before, they had beaten the enemy then penned up in the town first\r\nat Champion's Hill, next at Big Black River Bridge, inflicting upon him\r\na loss of fifteen thousand or more men (including those cut off from\r\nreturning) besides large losses in arms and ammunition.  The Army of the\r\nTennessee had come to believe that they could beat their antagonist\r\nunder any circumstances.  There was no telling how long a regular siege\r\nmight last.  As I have stated, it was the beginning of the hot season in\r\na Southern climate.  There was no telling what the casualties might be\r\namong Northern troops working and living in trenches, drinking surface\r\nwater filtered through rich vegetation, under a tropical sun.  If\r\nVicksburg could have been carried in May, it would not only have saved\r\nthe army the risk it ran of a greater danger than from the bullets of\r\nthe enemy, but it would have given us a splendid army, well equipped and\r\nofficered, to operate elsewhere with. These are reasons justifying the\r\nassault.  The only benefit we gained--and it was a slight one for so\r\ngreat a sacrifice--was that the men worked cheerfully in the trenches\r\nafter that, being satisfied with digging the enemy out.  Had the assault\r\nnot been made, I have no doubt that the majority of those engaged in the\r\nsiege of Vicksburg would have believed that had we assaulted it would\r\nhave proven successful, and would have saved life, health and comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nLEFT FLANK MOVEMENT ACROSS THE CHICKAHOMINY AND JAMES--GENERAL LEE\r\n--VISIT TO BUTLER--THE MOVEMENT ON PETERSBURG--THE INVESTMENT OF\r\nPETERSBURG.\r\n\r\nLee's position was now so near Richmond, and the intervening swamps of\r\nthe Chickahominy so great an obstacle to the movement of troops in the\r\nface of an enemy, that I determined to make my next left flank move\r\ncarry the Army of the Potomac south of the James River. (*34)\r\nPreparations for this were promptly commenced. The move was a hazardous\r\none to make:  the Chickahominy River, with its marshy and heavily\r\ntimbered approaches, had to be crossed; all the bridges over it east of\r\nLee were destroyed; the enemy had a shorter line and better roads to\r\ntravel on to confront me in crossing; more than fifty miles intervened\r\nbetween me and Butler, by the roads I should have to travel, with both\r\nthe James and the Chickahominy unbridged to cross; and last, the Army of\r\nthe Potomac had to be got out of a position but a few hundred yards from\r\nthe enemy at the widest place.  Lee, if he did not choose to follow me,\r\nmight, with his shorter distance to travel and his bridges over the\r\nChickahominy and the James, move rapidly on Butler and crush him before\r\nthe army with me could come to his relief.  Then too he might spare\r\ntroops enough to send against Hunter who was approaching Lynchburg,\r\nliving upon the country he passed through, and without ammunition\r\nfurther than what he carried with him.\r\n\r\nBut the move had to be made, and I relied upon Lee's not seeing my\r\ndanger as I saw it.  Besides we had armies on both sides of the James\r\nRiver and not far from the Confederate capital.  I knew that its safety\r\nwould be a matter of the first consideration with the executive,\r\nlegislative and judicial branches of the so-called Confederate\r\ngovernment, if it was not with the military commanders.  But I took all\r\nthe precaution I knew of to guard against all dangers.\r\n\r\nSheridan was sent with two divisions, to communicate with Hunter and to\r\nbreak up the Virginia Central Railroad and the James River Canal, on the\r\n7th of June, taking instructions to Hunter to come back with him (*35).\r\nHunter was also informed by way of Washington and the Valley that\r\nSheridan was on the way to meet him.  The canal and Central Road, and\r\nthe regions penetrated by them, were of vast importance to the enemy,\r\nfurnishing and carrying a large per cent. of all the supplies for the\r\nArmy of Northern Virginia and the people of Richmond.  Before Sheridan\r\ngot off on the 7th news was received from Hunter reporting his advance\r\nto Staunton and successful engagement with the enemy near that place on\r\nthe 5th, in which the Confederate commander, W. S. Jones, was killed.\r\nOn the 4th of June the enemy having withdrawn his left corps, Burnside\r\non our right was moved up between Warren and Smith.  On the 5th Birney\r\nreturned to Hancock, which extended his left now to the Chickahominy,\r\nand Warren was withdrawn to Cold Harbor.  Wright was directed to send\r\ntwo divisions to the left to extend down the banks of that stream to\r\nBottom's Bridge.  The cavalry extended still farther east to Jones's\r\nBridge.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th Abercrombie--who was in command at White House, and who had\r\nbeen in command at our base of supplies in all the changes made from the\r\nstart--was ordered to take up the iron from the York River Railroad and\r\nput it on boats, and to be in readiness to move by water to City Point.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th Meade was directed to fortify a line down the bank\r\noverlooking the Chickahominy, under cover of which the army could move.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th Abercrombie was directed to send all organized troops\r\narriving at White House, without debarking from their transports, to\r\nreport to Butler.  Halleck was at this time instructed to send all\r\nreinforcements to City Point.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th I wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD HARBOR, VA., June 11, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GEN. B. F. BUTLER, Commanding Department of Va. and N. C.\r\n\r\nThe movement to transfer this army to the south side of the James River\r\nwill commence after dark to-morrow night.  Col. Comstock, of my staff,\r\nwas sent specially to ascertain what was necessary to make your position\r\nsecure in the interval during which the enemy might use most of his\r\nforce against you, and also, to ascertain what point on the river we\r\nshould reach to effect a crossing if it should not be practicable to\r\nreach this side of the river at Bermuda Hundred.  Colonel Comstock has\r\nnot yet returned, so that I cannot make instructions as definite as I\r\nwould wish, but the time between this and Sunday night being so short in\r\nwhich to get word to you, I must do the best I can.  Colonel Dent goes\r\nto the Chickahominy to take to you the 18th corps.  The corps will leave\r\nits position in the trenches as early in the evening, tomorrow, as\r\npossible, and make a forced march to Cole's Landing or Ferry, where it\r\nshould reach by ten A.M. the following morning.  This corps numbers now\r\n15,300 men.  They take with them neither wagons nor artillery; these\r\nlatter marching with the balance of the army to the James River.  The\r\nremainder of the army will cross the Chickahominy at Long Bridge and at\r\nJones's, and strike the river at the most practicable crossing below\r\nCity Point.\r\n\r\nI directed several days ago that all reinforcements for the army should\r\nbe sent to you.  I am not advised of the number that may have gone, but\r\nsuppose you have received from six to ten thousand.  General Smith will\r\nalso reach you as soon as the enemy could, going by the way of Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe balance of the force will not be more than one day behind, unless\r\ndetained by the whole of Lee's army, in which case you will be strong\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nI wish you would direct the proper staff officers, your chief-engineer\r\nand your chief-quartermaster, to commence at once the collection of all\r\nthe means in their reach for crossing the army on its arrival.  If there\r\nis a point below City Point where a pontoon bridge can be thrown, have\r\nit laid.\r\n\r\nExpecting the arrival of the 18th corps by Monday night, if you deem it\r\npracticable from the force you have to seize and hold Petersburg, you\r\nmay prepare to start, on the arrival of troops to hold your present\r\nlines.  I do not want Petersburg visited, however, unless it is held,\r\nnor an attempt to take it, unless you feel a reasonable degree of\r\nconfidence of success.  If you should go there, I think troops should\r\ntake nothing with them except what they can carry, depending upon\r\nsupplies being sent after the place is secured.  If Colonel Dent should\r\nnot succeed in securing the requisite amount of transportation for the\r\n18th corps before reaching you, please have the balance supplied.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\nP. S.--On reflection I will send the 18th corps by way of White House.\r\nThe distance which they will have to march will be enough shorter to\r\nenable them to reach you about the same time, and the uncertainty of\r\nnavigation on the Chickahominy will be avoided.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD HARBOR, VA., June 11,1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL G. G. MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nColonel Comstock, who visited the James River for the purpose of\r\nascertaining the best point below Bermuda Hundred to which to march the\r\narmy has not yet returned.  It is now getting so late, however, that all\r\npreparations may be made for the move to-morrow night without waiting\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nThe movement will be made as heretofore agreed upon, that is, the 18th\r\ncorps make a rapid march with the infantry alone, their wagons and\r\nartillery accompanying the balance of the army to Cole's Landing or\r\nFerry, and there embark for City Point, losing no time for rest until\r\nthey reach the latter point.\r\n\r\nThe 5th corps will seize Long Bridge and move out on the Long Bridge\r\nRoad to its junction with Quaker Road, or until stopped by the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe other three corps will follow in such order as you may direct, one\r\nof them crossing at Long Bridge, and two at Jones's Bridge.  After the\r\ncrossing is effected, the most practicable roads will be taken to reach\r\nabout Fort Powhattan.  Of course, this is supposing the enemy makes no\r\nopposition to our advance.  The 5th corps, after securing the passage of\r\nthe balance of the army, will join or follow in rear of the corps which\r\ncrosses the same bridge with themselves.  The wagon trains should be\r\nkept well east of the troops, and if a crossing can be found, or made\r\nlower down than Jones's they should take it.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\nP. S.--In view of the long march to reach Cole's Landing, and the\r\nuncertainty of being able to embark a large number of men there, the\r\ndirection of the 18th corps may be changed to White House.  They should\r\nbe directed to load up transports, and start them as fast as loaded\r\nwithout waiting for the whole corps or even whole divisions to go\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time word was received (through the Richmond papers of the\r\n11th) that Crook and Averell had united and were moving east.  This,\r\nwith the news of Hunter's successful engagement near Staunton, was no\r\ndoubt known to Lee before it was to me. Then Sheridan leaving with two\r\ndivisions of cavalry, looked indeed threatening, both to Lee's\r\ncommunications and supplies. Much of his cavalry was sent after\r\nSheridan, and Early with Ewell's entire corps was sent to the Valley.\r\nSupplies were growing scarce in Richmond, and the sources from which to\r\ndraw them were in our hands.  People from outside began to pour into\r\nRichmond to help eat up the little on hand.  Consternation reigned\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th Smith was ordered to move at night to White House, not to\r\nstop until he reached there, and to take boats at once for City Point,\r\nleaving his trains and artillery to move by land.\r\n\r\nSoon after dark some of the cavalry at Long Bridge effected a crossing\r\nby wading and floundering through the water and mud, leaving their\r\nhorses behind, and drove away the cavalry pickets.  A pontoon bridge was\r\nspeedily thrown across, over which the remainder of the army soon passed\r\nand pushed out for a mile or two to watch and detain any advance that\r\nmight be made from the other side.  Warren followed the cavalry, and by\r\nthe morning of the 13th had his whole corps over.  Hancock followed\r\nWarren.  Burnside took the road to Jones's Bridge, followed by Wright.\r\nFerrero's division, with the wagon train, moved farther east, by Window\r\nShades and Cole's Ferry, our rear being covered by cavalry.\r\n\r\nIt was known that the enemy had some gunboats at Richmond. These might\r\nrun down at night and inflict great damage upon us before they could be\r\nsunk or captured by our navy.  General Butler had, in advance, loaded\r\nsome vessels with stone ready to be sunk so as to obstruct the channel\r\nin an emergency.  On the 13th I sent orders to have these sunk as high\r\nup the river as we could guard them, and prevent their removal by the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Warren's corps was over the Chickahominy it marched out and\r\njoined the cavalry in holding the roads from Richmond while the army\r\npassed.  No attempt was made by the enemy to impede our march, however,\r\nbut Warren and Wilson reported the enemy strongly fortified in their\r\nfront.  By the evening of the 13th Hancock's corps was at Charles City\r\nCourt House on the James River.  Burnside's and Wright's corps were on\r\nthe Chickahominy, and crossed during the night, Warren's corps and the\r\ncavalry still covering the army.  The material for a pontoon bridge was\r\nalready at hand and the work of laying it was commenced immediately,\r\nunder the superintendence of Brigadier-General Benham, commanding the\r\nengineer brigade.  On the evening of the 14th the crossing commenced,\r\nHancock in advance, using both the bridge and boats.\r\n\r\nWhen the Wilderness campaign commenced the Army of the Potomac,\r\nincluding Burnside's--which was a separate command until the 24th of May\r\nwhen it was incorporated with the main army--numbered about 116,000 men.\r\nDuring the progress of the campaign about 40,000 reinforcements were\r\nreceived.  At the crossing of the James River June 14th-15th the army\r\nnumbered about 115,000.  Besides the ordinary losses incident to a\r\ncampaign of six weeks' nearly constant fighting or skirmishing, about\r\none-half of the artillery was sent back to Washington, and many men were\r\ndischarged by reason of the expiration of their term of service.* In\r\nestimating our strength every enlisted man and every commissioned\r\nofficer present is included, no matter how employed; in bands, sick in\r\nfield hospitals, hospital attendants, company cooks and all.  Operating\r\nin an enemy's country, and being supplied always from a distant base,\r\nlarge detachments had at all times to be sent from the front, not only\r\nto guard the base of supplies and the roads to it, but all the roads\r\nleading to our flanks and rear.  We were also operating in a country\r\nunknown to us, and without competent guides or maps showing the roads\r\naccurately.\r\n\r\nThe manner of estimating numbers in the two armies differs materially.\r\nIn the Confederate army often only bayonets are taken into account,\r\nnever, I believe, do they estimate more than are handling the guns of\r\nthe artillery and armed with muskets (*36) or carbines.  Generally the\r\nlatter are far enough away to be excluded from the count in any one\r\nfield.  Officers and details of enlisted men are not included.  In the\r\nNorthern armies the estimate is most liberal, taking in all connected\r\nwith the army and drawing pay.\r\n\r\nEstimated in the same manner as ours, Lee had not less than 80,000 men\r\nat the start.  His reinforcements were about equal to ours during the\r\ncampaign, deducting the discharged men and those sent back.  He was on\r\nthe defensive, and in a country in which every stream, every road, every\r\nobstacle to the movement of troops and every natural defence was\r\nfamiliar to him and his army.  The citizens were all friendly to him and\r\nhis cause, and could and did furnish him with accurate reports of our\r\nevery move.  Rear guards were not necessary for him, and having always a\r\nrailroad at his back, large wagon trains were not required. All\r\ncircumstances considered we did not have any advantage in numbers.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee, who had led the Army of Northern Virginia in all these\r\ncontests, was a very highly estimated man in the Confederate army and\r\nStates, and filled also a very high place in the estimation of the\r\npeople and press of the Northern States.  His praise was sounded\r\nthroughout the entire North after every action he was engaged in:  the\r\nnumber of his forces was always lowered and that of the National forces\r\nexaggerated.  He was a large, austere man, and I judge difficult of\r\napproach to his subordinates.  To be extolled by the entire press of the\r\nSouth after every engagement, and by a portion of the press North with\r\nequal vehemence, was calculated to give him the entire confidence of his\r\ntroops and to make him feared by his antagonists.  It was not an\r\nuncommon thing for my staff-officers to hear from Eastern officers,\r\n\"Well, Grant has never met Bobby Lee yet.\"  There were good and true\r\nofficers who believe now that the Army of Northern Virginia was superior\r\nto the Army of the Potomac man to man.  I do not believe so, except as\r\nthe advantages spoken of above made them so.  Before the end I believe\r\nthe difference was the other way.  The Army of Northern Virginia became\r\ndespondent and saw the end.  It did not please them.  The National army\r\nsaw the same thing, and were encouraged by it.\r\n\r\nThe advance of the Army of the Potomac reached the James on the 14th of\r\nJune.  Preparations were at once commenced for laying the pontoon\r\nbridges and crossing the river.  As already stated, I had previously\r\nordered General Butler to have two vessels loaded with stone and carried\r\nup the river to a point above that occupied by our gunboats, where the\r\nchannel was narrow, and sunk there so as to obstruct the passage and\r\nprevent Confederate gunboats from coming down the river.  Butler had had\r\nthese boats filled and put in position, but had not had them sunk before\r\nmy arrival.  I ordered this done, and also directed that he should turn\r\nover all material and boats not then in use in the river to be used in\r\nferrying the troops across.\r\n\r\nI then, on the 14th, took a steamer and ran up to Bermuda Hundred to see\r\nGeneral Butler for the purpose of directing a movement against\r\nPetersburg, while our troops of the Army of the Potomac were crossing.\r\n\r\nI had sent General W. F. Smith back from Cold Harbor by the way of White\r\nHouse, thence on steamers to City Point for the purpose of giving\r\nGeneral Butler more troops with which to accomplish this result.\r\nGeneral Butler was ordered to send Smith with his troops reinforced, as\r\nfar as that could be conveniently done, from other parts of the Army of\r\nthe James.  He gave Smith about six thousand reinforcements, including\r\nsome twenty-five hundred cavalry under Kautz, and about thirty-five\r\nhundred colored infantry under Hinks.\r\n\r\nThe distance which Smith had to move to reach the enemy's lines was\r\nabout six miles, and the Confederate advance line of works was but two\r\nmiles outside of Petersburg.  Smith was to move under cover of night, up\r\nclose to the enemy's works, and assault as soon as he could after\r\ndaylight.  I believed then, and still believe, that Petersburg could\r\nhave been easily captured at that time.  It only had about 2,500 men in\r\nthe defences besides some irregular troops, consisting of citizens and\r\nemployees in the city who took up arms in case of emergency.  Smith\r\nstarted as proposed, but his advance encountered a rebel force\r\nintrenched between City Point and their lines outside of Petersburg.\r\nThis position he carried, with some loss to the enemy; but there was so\r\nmuch delay that it was daylight before his troops really got off from\r\nthere.  While there I informed General Butler that Hancock's corps would\r\ncross the river and move to Petersburg to support Smith in case the\r\nlatter was successful, and that I could reinforce there more rapidly\r\nthan Lee could reinforce from his position.\r\n\r\nI returned down the river to where the troops of the Army of the Potomac\r\nnow were, communicated to General Meade, in writing, the directions I\r\nhad given to General Butler and directed him (Meade) to cross Hancock's\r\ncorps over under cover of night, and push them forward in the morning to\r\nPetersburg; halting them, however, at a designated point until they\r\ncould hear from Smith.  I also informed General Meade that I had ordered\r\nrations from Bermuda Hundred for Hancock's corps, and desired him to\r\nissue them speedily, and to lose no more time than was absolutely\r\nnecessary.  The rations did not reach him, however, and Hancock, while\r\nhe got all his corps over during the night, remained until half-past ten\r\nin the hope of receiving them.  He then moved without them, and on the\r\nroad received a note from General W. F. Smith, asking him to come on.\r\nThis seems to be the first information that General Hancock had received\r\nof the fact that he was to go to Petersburg, or that anything particular\r\nwas expected of him.  Otherwise he would have been there by four o'clock\r\nin the afternoon.\r\n\r\nSmith arrived in front of the enemy's lines early in the forenoon of the\r\n15th, and spent the day until after seven o'clock in the evening in\r\nreconnoitering what appeared to be empty works.  The enemy's line\r\nconsisted of redans occupying commanding positions, with rifle-pits\r\nconnecting them.  To the east side of Petersburg, from the Appomattox\r\nback, there were thirteen of these redans extending a distance of\r\nseveral miles, probably three.  If they had been properly manned they\r\ncould have held out against any force that could have attacked them, at\r\nleast until reinforcements could have got up from the north of Richmond.\r\n\r\nSmith assaulted with the colored troops, and with success.  By nine\r\no'clock at night he was in possession of five of these redans and, of\r\ncourse, of the connecting lines of rifle-pits. All of them contained\r\nartillery, which fell into our hands. Hancock came up and proposed to\r\ntake any part assigned to him; and Smith asked him to relieve his men\r\nwho were in the trenches.\r\n\r\nNext morning, the 16th, Hancock himself was in command, and captured\r\nanother redan.  Meade came up in the afternoon and succeeded Hancock,\r\nwho had to be relieved, temporarily, from the command of his corps on\r\naccount of the breaking out afresh of the wound he had received at\r\nGettysburg.  During the day Meade assaulted and carried one more redan\r\nto his right and two to his left.  In all this we lost very heavily.\r\nThe works were not strongly manned, but they all had guns in them which\r\nfell into our hands, together with the men who were handling them in the\r\neffort to repel these assaults.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Beauregard, who had commanded south of Richmond, had\r\nreceived no reinforcements, except Hoke's division from Drury's\r\nBluff,(*37) which had arrived on the morning of the 16th; though he had\r\nurged the authorities very strongly to send them, believing, as he did,\r\nthat Petersburg would be a valuable prize which we might seek.\r\n\r\nDuring the 17th the fighting was very severe and the losses heavy; and\r\nat night our troops occupied about the same position they had occupied\r\nin the morning, except that they held a redan which had been captured by\r\nPotter during the day.  During the night, however, Beauregard fell back\r\nto the line which had been already selected, and commenced fortifying\r\nit.  Our troops advanced on the 18th to the line which he had abandoned,\r\nand found that the Confederate loss had been very severe, many of the\r\nenemy's dead still remaining in the ditches and in front of them.\r\n\r\nColonel J. L. Chamberlain, of the 20th Maine, was wounded on the 18th.\r\nHe was gallantly leading his brigade at the time, as he had been in\r\nthe habit of doing in all the engagements in which he had previously\r\nbeen engaged.  He had several times been recommended for a\r\nbrigadier-generalcy for gallant and meritorious conduct.  On this\r\noccasion, however, I promoted him on the spot, and forwarded a copy of\r\nmy order to the War Department, asking that my act might be confirmed\r\nand Chamberlain's name sent to the Senate for confirmation without any\r\ndelay.  This was done, and at last a gallant and meritorious officer\r\nreceived partial justice at the hands of his government, which he had\r\nserved so faithfully and so well.\r\n\r\nIf General Hancock's orders of the 15th had been communicated to him,\r\nthat officer, with his usual promptness, would undoubtedly have been\r\nupon the ground around Petersburg as early as four o'clock in the\r\nafternoon of the 15th.  The days were long and it would have given him\r\nconsiderable time before night.  I do not think there is any doubt that\r\nPetersburg itself could have been carried without much loss; or, at\r\nleast, if protected by inner detached works, that a line could have been\r\nestablished very much in rear of the one then occupied by the enemy.\r\nThis would have given us control of both the Weldon and South Side\r\nrailroads.  This would also have saved an immense amount of hard\r\nfighting which had to be done from the 15th to the 18th, and would have\r\ngiven us greatly the advantage in the long siege which ensued.\r\n\r\nI now ordered the troops to be put under cover and allowed some of the\r\nrest which they had so long needed.  They remained quiet, except that\r\nthere was more or less firing every day, until the 22d, when General\r\nMeade ordered an advance towards the Weldon Railroad.  We were very\r\nanxious to get to that road, and even round to the South Side Railroad\r\nif possible.\r\n\r\nMeade moved Hancock's corps, now commanded by Birney, to the left, with\r\na view to at least force the enemy to stay within the limits of his own\r\nline.  General Wright, with the 6th corps, was ordered by a road farther\r\nsouth, to march directly for the Weldon road.  The enemy passed in\r\nbetween these two corps and attacked vigorously, and with very serious\r\nresults to the National troops, who were then withdrawn from their\r\nadvanced position.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Potomac was given the investment of Petersburg, while\r\nthe Army of the James held Bermuda Hundred and all the ground we\r\npossessed north of the James River.  The 9th corps, Burnside's, was\r\nplaced upon the right at Petersburg; the 5th, Warren's, next; the 2d,\r\nBirney's, next; then the 6th, Wright's, broken off to the left and\r\nsouth.  Thus began the siege of Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nRAID ON THE VIRGINIA CENTRAL RAILROAD--RAID ON THE WELDON RAILROAD\r\n--EARLY 'S MOVEMENT UPON WASHINGTON--MINING THE WORKS BEFORE PETERSBURG\r\n--EXPLOSION OF THE MINE BEFORE PETERSBURG--CAMPAIGN IN THE SHENANDOAH\r\nVALLEY--CAPTURE OF THE WELDON RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of June, while at Cold Harbor, I had as already indicated\r\nsent Sheridan with two divisions of cavalry to destroy as much as he\r\ncould of the Virginia Central Railroad.  General Hunter had been\r\noperating up the Shenandoah Valley with some success, having fought a\r\nbattle near Staunton where he captured a great many prisoners, besides\r\nkilling and wounding a good many men.  After the battle he formed a\r\njunction at Staunton with Averell and Crook, who had come up from the\r\nKanawha, or Gauley River.  It was supposed, therefore, that General\r\nHunter would be about Charlottesville, Virginia, by the time Sheridan\r\ncould get there, doing on the way the damage that he was sent to do.\r\n\r\nI gave Sheridan instructions to have Hunter, in case he should meet him\r\nabout Charlottesville, join and return with him to the Army of the\r\nPotomac.  Lee, hearing of Hunter's success in the valley, started\r\nBreckinridge out for its defence at once. Learning later of Sheridan's\r\ngoing with two divisions, he also sent Hampton with two divisions of\r\ncavalry, his own and Fitz-Hugh Lee's.\r\n\r\nSheridan moved to the north side of the North Anna to get out west, and\r\nlearned of the movement of these troops to the south side of the same\r\nstream almost as soon as they had started. He pushed on to get to\r\nTrevilian Station to commence his destruction at that point.  On the\r\nnight of the 10th he bivouacked some six or seven miles east of\r\nTrevilian, while Fitz-Hugh Lee was the same night at Trevilian Station\r\nand Hampton but a few miles away.\r\n\r\nDuring the night Hampton ordered an advance on Sheridan, hoping, no\r\ndoubt, to surprise and very badly cripple him.  Sheridan, however, by a\r\ncounter move sent Custer on a rapid march to get between the two\r\ndivisions of the enemy and into their rear. This he did successfully, so\r\nthat at daylight, when the assault was made, the enemy found himself at\r\nthe same time resisted in front and attacked in rear, and broke in some\r\nconfusion.  The losses were probably very light on both sides in killed\r\nand wounded, but Sheridan got away with some five hundred prisoners and\r\nsent them to City Point.\r\n\r\nDuring that day, the 11th, Sheridan moved into Trevilian Station, and\r\nthe following day proceeded to tear up the road east and west.  There\r\nwas considerable fighting during the whole of the day, but the work of\r\ndestruction went on.  In the meantime, at night, the enemy had taken\r\npossession of the crossing which Sheridan had proposed to take to go\r\nnorth when he left Trevilian.  Sheridan learned, however, from some of\r\nthe prisoners he had captured here, that General Hunter was about\r\nLynchburg, and therefore that there was no use of his going on to\r\nCharlottesville with a view to meet him.\r\n\r\nSheridan started back during the night of the 12th, and made his way\r\nnorth and farther east, coming around by the north side of White House,\r\nand arriving there on the 21st.  Here he found an abundance of forage\r\nfor his animals, food for his men, and security while resting.  He had\r\nbeen obliged to leave about ninety of his own men in the field-hospital\r\nwhich he had established near Trevilian, and these necessarily fell into\r\nthe hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhite House up to this time had been a depot; but now that our troops\r\nwere all on the James River, it was no longer wanted as a store of\r\nsupplies.  Sheridan was, therefore, directed to break it up; which he\r\ndid on the 22d of June, bringing the garrison and an immense wagon train\r\nwith him.  All these were over the James River by the 26th of the month,\r\nand Sheridan ready to follow.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Meade had sent Wilson's division on a raid to destroy\r\nthe Weldon and South Side roads.  Now that Sheridan was safe and Hampton\r\nfree to return to Richmond with his cavalry, Wilson's position became\r\nprecarious.  Meade therefore, on the 27th, ordered Sheridan over the\r\nriver to make a demonstration in favor of Wilson.  Wilson got back,\r\nthough not without severe loss, having struck both roads, but the damage\r\ndone was soon repaired.\r\n\r\nAfter these events comparative quiet reigned about Petersburg until late\r\nin July.  The time, however, was spent in strengthening the\r\nintrenchments and making our position generally more secure against a\r\nsudden attack.  In the meantime I had to look after other portions of my\r\ncommand, where things had not been going on so favorably, always, as I\r\ncould have wished.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hunter who had been appointed to succeed Sigel in the Shenandoah\r\nValley immediately took up the offensive.  He met the enemy on the 5th\r\nof June at Piedmont, and defeated him.  On the 8th he formed a junction\r\nwith Crook and Averell at Staunton, from which place he moved direct on\r\nLynchburg, via Lexington, which he reached and invested on the 16th.  Up\r\nto this time he was very successful; and but for the difficulty of\r\ntaking with him sufficient ordnance stores over so long a march, through\r\na hostile country, he would, no doubt, have captured Lynchburg. The\r\ndestruction of the enemy's supplies and manufactories had been very\r\ngreat.  To meet this movement under General Hunter, General Lee sent\r\nEarly with his corps, a part of which reached Lynchburg before Hunter.\r\nAfter some skirmishing on the 17th and 18th, General Hunter, owing to a\r\nwant of ammunition to give battle, retired from before the place.\r\nUnfortunately, this want of ammunition left him no choice of route for\r\nhis return but by the way of the Gauley and Kanawha rivers, thence up\r\nthe Ohio River, returning to Harper's Ferry by way of the Baltimore and\r\nOhio Railroad.  A long time was consumed in making this movement.\r\nMeantime the valley was left open to Early's troops, and others in that\r\nquarter; and Washington also was uncovered. Early took advantage of this\r\ncondition of affairs and moved on Washington.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Hunter, General Lew Wallace, with headquarters at\r\nBaltimore, commanded the department in which the Shenandoah lay.  His\r\nsurplus of troops with which to move against the enemy was small in\r\nnumber.  Most of these were raw and, consequently, very much inferior to\r\nour veterans and to the veterans which Early had with him; but the\r\nsituation of Washington was precarious, and Wallace moved with\r\ncommendable promptitude to meet the enemy at the Monocacy.  He could\r\nhardly have expected to defeat him badly, but he hoped to cripple and\r\ndelay him until Washington could be put into a state of preparation for\r\nhis reception.  I had previously ordered General Meade to send a\r\ndivision to Baltimore for the purpose of adding to the defences of\r\nWashington, and he had sent Ricketts's division of the 6th corps\r\n(Wright's), which arrived in Baltimore on the 8th of July.  Finding that\r\nWallace had gone to the front with his command, Ricketts immediately\r\ntook the cars and followed him to the Monocacy with his entire division.\r\nThey met the enemy and, as might have been expected, were defeated; but\r\nthey succeeded in stopping him for the day on which the battle took\r\nplace.  The next morning Early started on his march to the capital of\r\nthe Nation, arriving before it on the 11th.\r\n\r\nLearning of the gravity of the situation I had directed General Meade to\r\nalso order Wright with the rest of his corps directly to Washington for\r\nthe relief of that place, and the latter reached there the very day that\r\nEarly arrived before it.  The 19th corps, which had been stationed in\r\nLouisiana, having been ordered up to reinforce the armies about\r\nRichmond, had about this time arrived at Fortress Monroe, on their way\r\nto join us. I diverted them from that point to Washington, which place\r\nthey reached, almost simultaneously with Wright, on the 11th.  The 19th\r\ncorps was commanded by Major-General Emory.\r\n\r\nEarly made his reconnoissance with a view of attacking on the following\r\nmorning, the 12th; but the next morning he found our intrenchments,\r\nwhich were very strong, fully manned.  He at once commenced to retreat,\r\nWright following.  There is no telling how much this result was\r\ncontributed to by General Lew Wallace's leading what might well be\r\nconsidered almost a forlorn hope.  If Early had been but one day earlier\r\nhe might have entered the capital before the arrival of the\r\nreinforcements I had sent. Whether the delay caused by the battle\r\namounted to a day or not, General Wallace contributed on this occasion,\r\nby the defeat of the troops under him a greater benefit to the cause\r\nthan often falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to render\r\nby means of a victory.\r\n\r\nFarther west also the troubles were threatening.  Some time before,\r\nForrest had met Sturgis in command of some of our cavalry in Mississippi\r\nand handled him very roughly, gaining a very great victory over him.\r\nThis left Forrest free to go almost where he pleased, and to cut the\r\nroads in rear of Sherman who was then advancing.  Sherman was abundantly\r\nable to look after the army that he was immediately with, and all of his\r\nmilitary division so long as he could communicate with it; but it was my\r\nplace to see that he had the means with which to hold his rear.  Two\r\ndivisions under A. J. Smith had been sent to Banks in Louisiana some\r\nmonths before.  Sherman ordered these back, with directions to attack\r\nForrest.  Smith met and defeated him very badly.  I then directed that\r\nSmith should hang to Forrest and not let him go; and to prevent by all\r\nmeans his getting upon the Memphis and Nashville Railroad.  Sherman had\r\nanticipated me in this matter, and given the same orders in substance;\r\nbut receiving my directions for this order to Smith, he repeated it.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of June General Burnside had commenced running a mine from\r\nabout the centre of his front under the Confederate works confronting\r\nhim.  He was induced to do this by Colonel Pleasants, of the\r\nPennsylvania Volunteers, whose regiment was mostly composed of miners,\r\nand who was himself a practical miner.  Burnside had submitted the\r\nscheme to Meade and myself, and we both approved of it, as a means of\r\nkeeping the men occupied.  His position was very favorable for carrying\r\non this work, but not so favorable for the operations to follow its\r\ncompletion.  The position of the two lines at that point were only about\r\na hundred yards apart with a comparatively deep ravine intervening.  In\r\nthe bottom of this ravine the work commenced.  The position was\r\nunfavorable in this particular: that the enemy's line at that point was\r\nre-entering, so that its front was commanded by their own lines both to\r\nthe right and left.  Then, too, the ground was sloping upward back of\r\nthe Confederate line for a considerable distance, and it was presumable\r\nthat the enemy had, at least, a detached work on this highest point.\r\nThe work progressed, and on the 23d of July the mine was finished ready\r\nfor charging; but I had this work of charging deferred until we were\r\nready for it.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of July several deserters came in and said that there was\r\ngreat consternation in Richmond, and that Lee was coming out to make an\r\nattack upon us the object being to put us on the defensive so that he\r\nmight detach troops to go to Georgia where the army Sherman was\r\noperating against was said to be in great trouble.  I put the army\r\ncommanders, Meade and Butler, on the lookout, but the attack was not\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nI concluded, then, a few days later, to do something in the way of\r\noffensive movement myself, having in view something of the same object\r\nthat Lee had had.  Wright's and Emory's corps were in Washington, and\r\nwith this reduction of my force Lee might very readily have spared some\r\ntroops from the defences to send West.  I had other objects in view,\r\nhowever, besides keeping Lee where he was.  The mine was constructed and\r\nready to be exploded, and I wanted to take that occasion to carry\r\nPetersburg if I could.  It was the object, therefore, to get as many of\r\nLee's troops away from the south side of the James River as possible.\r\nAccordingly, on the 26th, we commenced a movement with Hancock's corps\r\nand Sheridan's cavalry to the north side by the way of Deep Bottom,\r\nwhere Butler had a pontoon bridge laid. The plan, in the main, was to\r\nlet the cavalry cut loose and, joining with Kautz's cavalry of the Army\r\nof the James, get by Lee's lines and destroy as much as they could of\r\nthe Virginia Central Railroad, while, in the mean time, the infantry was\r\nto move out so as to protect their rear and cover their retreat back\r\nwhen they should have got through with their work.  We were successful\r\nin drawing the enemy's troops to the north side of the James as I\r\nexpected.  The mine was ordered to be charged, and the morning of the\r\n30th of July was the time fixed for its explosion.  I gave Meade minute\r\norders (*38) on the 24th directing how I wanted the assault conducted,\r\nwhich orders he amplified into general instructions for the guidance of\r\nthe troops that were to be engaged.\r\n\r\nMeade's instructions, which I, of course, approved most heartily, were\r\nall that I can see now was necessary.  The only further precaution which\r\nhe could have taken, and which he could not foresee, would have been to\r\nhave different men to execute them.\r\n\r\nThe gallery to the mine was over five hundred feet long from where it\r\nentered the ground to the point where it was under the enemy's works,\r\nand with a cross gallery of something over eighty feet running under\r\ntheir lines.  Eight chambers had been left, requiring a ton of powder\r\neach to charge them.  All was ready by the time I had prescribed; and on\r\nthe 29th Hancock and Sheridan were brought back near the James River\r\nwith their troops.  Under cover of night they started to recross the\r\nbridge at Deep Bottom, and to march directly for that part of our lines\r\nin front of the mine.\r\n\r\nWarren was to hold his line of intrenchments with a sufficient number of\r\nmen and concentrate the balance on the right next to Burnside's corps,\r\nwhile Ord, now commanding the 18th corps, temporarily under Meade, was\r\nto form in the rear of Burnside to support him when he went in.  All\r\nwere to clear off the parapets and the _abatis_ in their front so as to\r\nleave the space as open as possible, and be able to charge the moment\r\nthe mine had been sprung and Burnside had taken possession.  Burnside's\r\ncorps was not to stop in the crater at all but push on to the top of the\r\nhill, supported on the right and left by Ord's and Warren's corps.\r\n\r\nWarren and Ord fulfilled their instructions perfectly so far as making\r\nready was concerned.  Burnside seemed to have paid no attention whatever\r\nto the instructions, and left all the obstruction in his own front for\r\nhis troops to get over in the best way they could.  The four divisions\r\nof his corps were commanded by Generals Potter, Willcox, Ledlie and\r\nFerrero.  The last was a colored division; and Burnside selected it to\r\nmake the assault.  Meade interfered with this.  Burnside then took\r\nLedlie's division--a worse selection than the first could have been.  In\r\nfact, Potter and Willcox were the only division commanders Burnside had\r\nwho were equal to the occasion.  Ledlie besides being otherwise\r\ninefficient, proved also to possess disqualification less common among\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThere was some delay about the explosion of the mine so that it did not\r\ngo off until about five o'clock in the morning.  When it did explode it\r\nwas very successful, making a crater twenty feet deep and something like\r\na hundred feet in length.  Instantly one hundred and ten cannon and\r\nfifty mortars, which had been placed in the most commanding positions\r\ncovering the ground to the right and left of where the troops were to\r\nenter the enemy's lines, commenced playing.  Ledlie's division marched\r\ninto the crater immediately on the explosion, but most of the men\r\nstopped there in the absence of any one to give directions; their\r\ncommander having found some safe retreat to get into before they\r\nstarted.  There was some delay on the left and right in advancing, but\r\nsome of the troops did get in and turn to the right and left, carrying\r\nthe rifle-pits as I expected they would do.\r\n\r\nThere had been great consternation in Petersburg, as we were well aware,\r\nabout a rumored mine that we were going to explode.  They knew we were\r\nmining, and they had failed to cut our mine off by countermining, though\r\nBeauregard had taken the precaution to run up a line of intrenchments to\r\nthe rear of that part of their line fronting where they could see that\r\nour men were at work.  We had learned through deserters who had come in\r\nthat the people had very wild rumors about what was going on on our\r\nside.  They said that we had undermined the whole of Petersburg; that\r\nthey were resting upon a slumbering volcano and did not know at what\r\nmoment they might expect an eruption.  I somewhat based my calculations\r\nupon this state of feeling, and expected that when the mine was exploded\r\nthe troops to the right and left would flee in all directions, and that\r\nour troops, if they moved promptly, could get in and strengthen\r\nthemselves before the enemy had come to a realization of the true\r\nsituation.  It was just as I expected it would be.  We could see the men\r\nrunning without any apparent object except to get away. It was half an\r\nhour before musketry firing, to amount to anything, was opened upon our\r\nmen in the crater.  It was an hour before the enemy got artillery up to\r\nplay upon them; and it was nine o'clock before Lee got up reinforcements\r\nfrom his right to join in expelling our troops.\r\n\r\nThe effort was a stupendous failure.  It cost us about four thousand\r\nmen, mostly, however, captured; and all due to inefficiency on the part\r\nof the corps commander and the incompetency of the division commander\r\nwho was sent to lead the assault.\r\n\r\nAfter being fully assured of the failure of the mine, and finding that\r\nmost of that part of Lee's army which had been drawn north of the James\r\nRiver were still there, I gave Meade directions to send a corps of\r\ninfantry and the cavalry next morning, before Lee could get his forces\r\nback, to destroy fifteen or twenty miles of the Weldon Railroad.  But\r\nmisfortunes never come singly.  I learned during that same afternoon\r\nthat Wright's pursuit of Early was feeble because of the constant and\r\ncontrary orders he had been receiving from Washington, while I was cut\r\noff from immediate communication by reason of our cable across\r\nChesapeake Bay being broken.  Early, however, was not aware of the fact\r\nthat Wright was not pursuing until he had reached Strasburg.  Finding\r\nthat he was not pursued he turned back to Winchester, where Crook was\r\nstationed with a small force, and drove him out.  He then pushed north\r\nuntil he had reached the Potomac, then he sent McCausland across to\r\nChambersburg, Pa., to destroy that town.  Chambersburg was a purely\r\ndefenceless town with no garrison whatever, and no fortifications; yet\r\nMcCausland, under Early's orders, burned the place and left about three\r\nhundred families houseless.  This occurred on the 30th of July.  I\r\nrescinded my orders for the troops to go out to destroy the Weldon\r\nRailroad, and directed them to embark for Washington City.  After\r\nburning Chambersburg McCausland retreated, pursued by our cavalry,\r\ntowards Cumberland.  They were met and defeated by General Kelley and\r\ndriven into Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe Shenandoah Valley was very important to the Confederates, because it\r\nwas the principal storehouse they now had for feeding their armies about\r\nRichmond.  It was well known that they would make a desperate struggle\r\nto maintain it.  It had been the source of a great deal of trouble to us\r\nheretofore to guard that outlet to the north, partly because of the\r\nincompetency of some of the commanders, but chiefly because of\r\ninterference from Washington.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be the policy of General Halleck and Secretary Stanton to\r\nkeep any force sent there, in pursuit of the invading army, moving right\r\nand left so as to keep between the enemy and our capital; and, generally\r\nspeaking, they pursued this policy until all knowledge of the\r\nwhereabouts of the enemy was lost. They were left, therefore, free to\r\nsupply themselves with horses, beef cattle, and such provisions as they\r\ncould carry away from Western Maryland and Pennsylvania.  I determined\r\nto put a stop to this.  I started Sheridan at once for that field of\r\noperation, and on the following day sent another division of his\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\nI had previously asked to have Sheridan assigned to that command, but\r\nMr. Stanton objected, on the ground that he was too young for so\r\nimportant a command.  On the 1st of August when I sent reinforcements\r\nfor the protection of Washington, I sent the following orders:\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA.,\r\n\r\nAugust 1, 1864, 11.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Washington D. C.\r\n\r\nI am sending General Sheridan for temporary duty whilst the enemy is\r\nbeing expelled from the border.  Unless General Hunter is in the field\r\nin person, I want Sheridan put in command of all the troops in the\r\nfield, with instructions to put himself south of the enemy and follow\r\nhim to the death.  Wherever the enemy goes let our troops go also.  Once\r\nstarted up the valley they ought to be followed until we get possession\r\nof the Virginia Central Railroad.  If General Hunter is in the field,\r\ngive Sheridan direct command of the 6th corps and cavalry division. All\r\nthe cavalry, I presume, will reach Washington in the course of\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President in some way or other got to see this dispatch of mine\r\ndirecting certain instructions to be given to the commanders in the\r\nfield, operating against Early, and sent me the following very\r\ncharacteristic dispatch:\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICE U. S. MILITARY TELEGRAPH, WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C.,\r\nAugust 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nCypher. 6 P.M.,\r\n\r\nLT. GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.\r\n\r\nI have seen your despatch in which you say, \"I want Sheridan put in\r\ncommand of all the troops in the field, with instructions to put himself\r\nsouth of the enemy, and follow him to the death. Wherever the enemy\r\ngoes, let our troops go also.\"  This, I think, is exactly right, as to\r\nhow our forces should move.  But please look over the despatches you may\r\nhave received from here, even since you made that order, and discover,\r\nif you can, that there is any idea in the head of any one here, of\r\n\"putting our army south of the enemy,\" or of \"following him to the\r\ndeath\" in any direction.  I repeat to you it will neither be done nor\r\nattempted unless you watch it every day, and hour, and force it.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI replied to this that \"I would start in two hours for Washington,\" and\r\nsoon got off, going directly to the Monocacy without stopping at\r\nWashington on my way.  I found General Hunter's army encamped there,\r\nscattered over the fields along the banks of the Monocacy, with many\r\nhundreds of cars and locomotives, belonging to the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nRailroad, which he had taken the precaution to bring back and collect at\r\nthat point.  I asked the general where the enemy was.  He replied that\r\nhe did not know.  He said the fact was, that he was so embarrassed with\r\norders from Washington moving him first to the right and then to the\r\nleft that he had lost all trace of the enemy.\r\n\r\nI then told the general that I would find out where the enemy was, and\r\nat once ordered steam got up and trains made up, giving directions to\r\npush for Halltown, some four miles above Harper's Ferry, in the\r\nShenandoah Valley.  The cavalry and the wagon trains were to march, but\r\nall the troops that could be transported by the cars were to go in that\r\nway.  I knew that the valley was of such importance to the enemy that,\r\nno matter how much he was scattered at that time, he would in a very\r\nshort time be found in front of our troops moving south.\r\n\r\nI then wrote out General Hunter's instructions. (*39)  I told him that\r\nSheridan was in Washington, and still another division was on its way;\r\nand suggested that he establish the headquarters of the department at\r\nany point that would suit him best, Cumberland, Baltimore, or elsewhere,\r\nand give Sheridan command of the troops in the field.  The general\r\nreplied to this, that he thought he had better be relieved entirely.  He\r\nsaid that General Halleck seemed so much to distrust his fitness for the\r\nposition he was in that he thought somebody else ought to be there.  He\r\ndid not want, in any way, to embarrass the cause; thus showing a\r\npatriotism that was none too common in the army.  There were not many\r\nmajor-generals who would voluntarily have asked to have the command of a\r\ndepartment taken from them on the supposition that for some particular\r\nreason, or for any reason, the service would be better performed.  I\r\ntold him, \"very well then,\" and telegraphed at once for Sheridan to come\r\nto the Monocacy, and suggested that I would wait and meet him there.\r\n\r\nSheridan came at once by special train, but reached there after the\r\ntroops were all off.  I went to the station and remained there until he\r\narrived.  Myself and one or two of my staff were about all the Union\r\npeople, except General Hunter and his staff, who were left at the\r\nMonocacy when Sheridan arrived.  I hastily told Sheridan what had been\r\ndone and what I wanted him to do, giving him, at the same time, the\r\nwritten instructions which had been prepared for General Hunter and\r\ndirected to that officer.\r\n\r\nSheridan now had about 30,000 men to move with, 8,000 of them being\r\ncavalry.  Early had about the same number, but the superior ability of\r\nthe National commander over the Confederate commander was so great that\r\nall the latter's advantage of being on the defensive was more than\r\ncounterbalanced by this circumstance.  As I had predicted, Early was\r\nsoon found in front of Sheridan in the valley, and Pennsylvania and\r\nMaryland were speedily freed from the invaders.  The importance of the\r\nvalley was so great to the Confederates that Lee reinforced Early, but\r\nnot to the extent that we thought and feared he would.\r\n\r\nTo prevent as much as possible these reinforcements from being sent out\r\nfrom Richmond, I had to do something to compel Lee to retain his forces\r\nabout his capital.  I therefore gave orders for another move to the\r\nnorth side of the James River, to threaten Richmond.  Hancock's corps,\r\npart of the 10th corps under Birney, and Gregg's division of cavalry\r\nwere crossed to the north side of the James during the night of the\r\n13th-14th of August.  A threatening position was maintained for a number\r\nof days, with more or less skirmishing, and some tolerably hard\r\nfighting; although it was my object and my instructions that anything\r\nlike a battle should be avoided, unless opportunities should present\r\nthemselves which would insure great success. General Meade was left in\r\ncommand of the few troops around Petersburg, strongly intrenched; and\r\nwas instructed to keep a close watch upon the enemy in that quarter, and\r\nhimself to take advantage of any weakening that might occur through an\r\neffort on the part of the enemy to reinforce the north side.  There was\r\nno particular victory gained on either side; but during that time no\r\nmore reinforcements were sent to the valley.\r\n\r\nI informed Sheridan of what had been done to prevent reinforcements\r\nbeing sent from Richmond against him, and also that the efforts we had\r\nmade had proven that one of the divisions which we supposed had gone to\r\nthe valley was still at Richmond, because we had captured six or seven\r\nhundred prisoners from that division, each of its four brigades having\r\ncontributed to our list of captures.  I also informed him that but one\r\ndivision had gone, and it was possible that I should be able to prevent\r\nthe going of any more.\r\n\r\nTo add to my embarrassment at this time Sherman, who was now near\r\nAtlanta, wanted reinforcements.  He was perfectly willing to take the\r\nraw troops then being raised in the North-west, saying that he could\r\nteach them more soldiering in one day among his troops than they would\r\nlearn in a week in a camp of instruction.  I therefore asked that all\r\ntroops in camps of instruction in the North-west be sent to him.\r\nSherman also wanted to be assured that no Eastern troops were moving out\r\nagainst him.  I informed him of what I had done and assured him that I\r\nwould hold all the troops there that it was possible for me to hold, and\r\nthat up to that time none had gone.  I also informed him that his real\r\ndanger was from Kirby Smith, who commanded the trans-Mississippi\r\nDepartment.  If Smith should escape Steele, and get across the\r\nMississippi River, he might move against him.  I had, therefore, asked\r\nto have an expedition ready to move from New Orleans against Mobile in\r\ncase Kirby Smith should get across.  This would have a tendency to draw\r\nhim to the defence of that place, instead of going against Sherman.\r\n\r\nRight in the midst of all these embarrassments Halleck informed me that\r\nthere was an organized scheme on foot in the North to resist the draft,\r\nand suggested that it might become necessary to draw troops from the\r\nfield to put it down.  He also advised taking in sail, and not going too\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nThe troops were withdrawn from the north side of the James River on the\r\nnight of the 20th.  Before they were withdrawn, however, and while most\r\nof Lee's force was on that side of the river, Warren had been sent with\r\nmost of the 5th corps to capture the Weldon Railroad.  He took up his\r\nline of march well back to the rear, south of the enemy, while the\r\ntroops remaining in the trenches extended so as to cover that part of\r\nthe line which he had vacated by moving out.  From our left, near the\r\nold line, it was about three miles to the Weldon Railroad.  A division\r\nwas ordered from the right of the Petersburg line to reinforce Warren,\r\nwhile a division was brought back from the north side of the James River\r\nto take its place.\r\n\r\nThis road was very important to the enemy.  The limits from which his\r\nsupplies had been drawn were already very much contracted, and I knew\r\nthat he must fight desperately to protect it.  Warren carried the road,\r\nthough with heavy loss on both sides.  He fortified his new position,\r\nand our trenches were then extended from the left of our main line to\r\nconnect with his new one.  Lee made repeated attempts to dislodge\r\nWarren's corps, but without success, and with heavy loss.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Warren was fortified and reinforcements reached him, troops\r\nwere sent south to destroy the bridges on the Weldon Railroad; and with\r\nsuch success that the enemy had to draw in wagons, for a distance of\r\nabout thirty miles, all the supplies they got thereafter from that\r\nsource.  It was on the 21st that Lee seemed to have given up the Weldon\r\nRailroad as having been lost to him; but along about the 24th or 25th he\r\nmade renewed attempts to recapture it; again he failed and with very\r\nheavy losses to him as compared with ours.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 20th our troops on the north side of the James were\r\nwithdrawn, and Hancock and Gregg were sent south to destroy the Weldon\r\nRailroad.  They were attacked on the 25th at Reams's Station, and after\r\ndesperate fighting a part of our line gave way, losing five pieces of\r\nartillery.  But the Weldon Railroad never went out of our possession\r\nfrom the 18th of August to the close of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nSHERIDAN'S ADVANCE--VISIT TO SHERIDAN--SHERIDAN'S VICTORY IN THE\r\nSHENANDOAH--SHERIDAN'S RIDE TO WINCHESTER--CLOSE OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE\r\nWINTER.\r\n\r\nWe had our troops on the Weldon Railroad contending against a large\r\nforce that regarded this road of so much importance that they could\r\nafford to expend many lives in retaking it; Sherman just getting through\r\nto Atlanta with great losses of men from casualties, discharges and\r\ndetachments left along as guards to occupy and hold the road in rear of\r\nhim; Washington threatened but a short time before, and now Early being\r\nstrengthened in the valley so as, probably, to renew that attempt.  It\r\nkept me pretty active in looking after all these points.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of August Sheridan had advanced on Early up the Shenandoah\r\nValley, Early falling back to Strasburg.  On the 12th I learned that Lee\r\nhad sent twenty pieces of artillery, two divisions of infantry and a\r\nconsiderable cavalry force to strengthen Early.  It was important that\r\nSheridan should be informed of this, so I sent the information to\r\nWashington by telegraph, and directed a courier to be sent from there to\r\nget the message to Sheridan at all hazards, giving him the information.\r\nThe messenger, an officer of the army, pushed through with great energy\r\nand reached Sheridan just in time. The officer went through by way of\r\nSnicker's Gap, escorted by some cavalry.  He found Sheridan just making\r\nhis preparations to attack Early in his chosen position.  Now, however,\r\nhe was thrown back on the defensive.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of September I started to visit General Sheridan in the\r\nShenandoah Valley.  My purpose was to have him attack Early, or drive\r\nhim out of the valley and destroy that source of supplies for Lee's\r\narmy.  I knew it was impossible for me to get orders through Washington\r\nto Sheridan to make a move, because they would be stopped there and such\r\norders as Halleck's caution (and that of the Secretary of War) would\r\nsuggest would be given instead, and would, no doubt, be contradictory to\r\nmine.  I therefore, without stopping at Washington, went directly\r\nthrough to Charlestown, some ten miles above Harper's Ferry, and waited\r\nthere to see General Sheridan, having sent a courier in advance to\r\ninform him where to meet me.\r\n\r\nWhen Sheridan arrived I asked him if he had a map showing the positions\r\nof his army and that of the enemy.  He at once drew one out of his side\r\npocket, showing all roads and streams, and the camps of the two armies.\r\nHe said that if he had permission he would move so and so (pointing out\r\nhow) against the Confederates, and that he could \"whip them.\"  Before\r\nstarting I had drawn up a plan of campaign for Sheridan, which I had\r\nbrought with me; but, seeing that he was so clear and so positive in his\r\nviews and so confident of success, I said nothing about this and did not\r\ntake it out of my pocket.\r\n\r\nSheridan's wagon trains were kept at Harper's Ferry, where all of his\r\nstores were.  By keeping the teams at that place, their forage did not\r\nhave to be hauled to them.  As supplies of ammunition, provisions and\r\nrations for the men were wanted, trains would be made up to deliver the\r\nstores to the commissaries and quartermasters encamped at Winchester.\r\nKnowing that he, in making preparations to move at a given day, would\r\nhave to bring up wagons trains from Harper's Ferry, I asked him if he\r\ncould be ready to get off by the following Tuesday.  This was on Friday.\r\n\"O Yes,\" he said, he \"could be off before daylight on Monday.\"  I told\r\nhim then to make the attack at that time and according to his own plan;\r\nand I immediately started to return to the army about Richmond.  After\r\nvisiting Baltimore and Burlington, New Jersey, I arrived at City Point\r\non the 19th.\r\n\r\nOn the way out to Harper's Ferry I had met Mr. Robert Garrett, President\r\nof the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.  He seemed very anxious to know when\r\nworkmen might be put upon the road again so as to make repairs and put\r\nit in shape for running.  It was a large piece of property to have\r\nstanding idle.  I told him I could not answer then positively but would\r\ntry and inform him before a great while.  On my return Mr. Garrett met\r\nme again with the same and I told him I thought that by the Wednesday he\r\nmight send his workmen out on his road.  I gave him no further\r\ninformation however, and he had no suspicion of how I expected to have\r\nthe road cleared for his workmen.\r\n\r\nSheridan moved at the time he had fixed upon.  He met Early at the\r\ncrossing of Opequon Creek, and won a most decisive victory--one which\r\nelectrified the country.  Early had invited this attack himself by his\r\nbad generalship and made the victory easy.  He had sent G. T. Anderson's\r\ndivision east of the Blue Ridge before I went to Harper's Ferry; and\r\nabout the time I arrived there he started other divisions (leaving but\r\ntwo in their camps) to march to Martinsburg for the purpose destroying\r\nthe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at that point.  Early here learned that\r\nI had been with Sheridan and, supposing there was some movement on foot,\r\nstarted back as soon as he got the information.  But his forces were\r\nseparated and, as I have said, he was very badly defeated.  He fell back\r\nto Fisher's Hill, Sheridan following.\r\n\r\nThe valley is narrow at that point, and Early made another stand there,\r\nbehind works which extended across.  But Sheridan turned both his flanks\r\nand again sent him speeding up the valley, following in hot pursuit.\r\nThe pursuit was continued up the valley to Mount Jackson and New Market.\r\nSheridan captured about eleven hundred prisoners and sixteen guns.  The\r\nhouses which he passed all along the route were found to be filled with\r\nEarly's wounded, and the country swarmed with his deserters.  Finally,\r\non the 25th, Early turned from the valley eastward, leaving Sheridan at\r\nHarrisonburg in undisputed possession.\r\n\r\nNow one of the main objects of the expedition began to be accomplished.\r\nSheridan went to work with his command, gathering in the crops, cattle,\r\nand everything in the upper part of the valley required by our troops;\r\nand especially taking what might be of use to the enemy.  What he could\r\nnot take away he destroyed, so that the enemy would not be invited to\r\ncome back there.  I congratulated Sheridan upon his recent great victory\r\nand had a salute of a hundred guns fired in honor of it, the guns being\r\naimed at the enemy around Petersburg.  I also notified the other\r\ncommanders throughout the country, who also fired salutes in honor of\r\nhis victory.\r\n\r\nI had reason to believe that the administration was a little afraid to\r\nhave a decisive battle at that time, for fear it might go against us and\r\nhave a bad effect on the November elections. The convention which had\r\nmet and made its nomination of the Democratic candidate for the\r\npresidency had declared the war a failure.  Treason was talked as boldly\r\nin Chicago at that convention as ever been in Charleston.  It was a\r\nquestion whether the government would then have had the power to make\r\narrests and punish those who talked treason.  But this decisive victory\r\nwas the most effective campaign argument made in the canvass.\r\n\r\nSheridan, in his pursuit, got beyond where they could hear from him in\r\nWashington, and the President became very much frightened about him.  He\r\nwas afraid that the hot pursuit had been a little like that of General\r\nCass was said to have been, in one of our Indian wars, when he was an\r\nofficer of army.  Cass was pursuing the Indians so closely that the\r\nfirst thing he knew he found himself in front, and the Indians pursuing\r\nhim.  The President was afraid that Sheridan had got on the other side\r\nof Early and that Early was in behind him.  He was afraid that Sheridan\r\nwas getting so far away that reinforcements would be sent out from\r\nRichmond to enable Early to beat him.  I replied to the President that I\r\nhad taken steps to prevent Lee from sending reinforcements to Early, by\r\nattacking the former where he was.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of September, to retain Lee in his position, I sent Ord with\r\nthe 18th corps and Birney with the 10th corps to make an advance on\r\nRichmond, to threaten it.  Ord moved with the left wing up to Chaffin's\r\nBluff; Birney with the 10th corps took a road farther north; while Kautz\r\nwith the cavalry took the Darby road, still farther to the north.  They\r\ngot across the river by the next morning, and made an effort to surprise\r\nthe enemy.  In that, however, they were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's lines were very strong and very intricate. Stannard's\r\ndivision of the 18th corps with General Burnham's brigade leading, tried\r\nan assault against Fort Harrison and captured it with sixteen guns and a\r\ngood many prisoners. Burnham was killed in the assault.  Colonel Stevens\r\nwho succeeded him was badly wounded; and his successor also fell in the\r\nsame way.  Some works to the right and left were also carried with the\r\nguns in them--six in number--and a few more prisoners.  Birney's troops\r\nto the right captured the enemy's intrenched picket-lines, but were\r\nunsuccessful in their efforts upon the main line.\r\n\r\nOur troops fortified their new position, bringing Fort Harrison into the\r\nnew line and extending it to the river.  This brought us pretty close to\r\nthe enemy on the north side of the James, and the two opposing lines\r\nmaintained their relative positions to the close of the siege.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon a further attempt was made to advance, but it failed.\r\nOrd fell badly wounded, and had to be relieved; the command devolved\r\nupon General Heckman, and later General Weitzel was assigned to the\r\ncommand of the 18th corps.  During the night Lee reinforced his troops\r\nabout Fort Gilmer, which was at the right of Fort Harrison, by eight\r\nadditional brigades from Petersburg, and attempted to retake the works\r\nwhich we had captured by concentrating ten brigades against them.  All\r\ntheir efforts failed, their attacks being all repulsed with very heavy\r\nloss.  In one of these assaults upon us General Stannard, a gallant\r\nofficer who was defending Fort Harrison, lost an arm. Our casualties\r\nduring these operations amounted to 394 killed, I,554 wounded and 324\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nWhilst this was going on General Meade was instructed to keep up an\r\nappearance of moving troops to our extreme left.  Parke and Warren were\r\nkept with two divisions, each under arms, ready to move leaving their\r\nenclosed batteries manned, with a scattering line on the other\r\nintrenchments.  The object of this was to prevent reinforcements from\r\ngoing to the north side of the river.  Meade was instructed to watch the\r\nenemy closely and, if Lee weakened his lines, to make an attack.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th these troops moved out, under Warren, and captured an\r\nadvanced intrenched camp at Peeble's farm, driving the enemy back to the\r\nmain line.  Our troops followed and made an attack in the hope of\r\ncarrying the enemy's main line; but in this they were unsuccessful and\r\nlost a large number of men, mostly captured.  The number of killed and\r\nwounded was not large.  The next day our troops advanced again and\r\nestablished themselves, intrenching a new line about a mile in front of\r\nthe enemy.  This advanced Warren's position on the Weldon Railroad very\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nSheridan having driven the enemy out of the valley, and taken the\r\nproductions of the valley so that instead of going there for supplies\r\nthe enemy would have to bring his provisions with him if he again\r\nentered it, recommended a reduction of his own force, the surplus to be\r\nsent where it could be of more use.  I approved of his suggestion, and\r\nordered him to send Wright's corps back to the James River.  I further\r\ndirected him to repair the railroad up the Shenandoah Valley towards the\r\nadvanced position which we would hold with a small force.  The troops\r\nwere to be sent to Washington by the way of Culpeper, in order to watch\r\nthe east side of the Blue Ridge, and prevent the enemy from getting into\r\nthe rear of Sheridan while he was still doing his work of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe valley was so very important, however, to the Confederate army that,\r\ncontrary to our expectations, they determined to make one more strike,\r\nand save it if possible before the supplies should be all destroyed.\r\nReinforcements were sent therefore to Early, and this before any of our\r\ntroops had been withdrawn. Early prepared to strike Sheridan at\r\nHarrisonburg; but the latter had not remained there.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of October Sheridan commenced retiring down the valley,\r\ntaking or destroying all the food and forage and driving the cattle\r\nbefore him, Early following.  At Fisher's Hill Sheridan turned his\r\ncavalry back on that of Early, which, under the lead of Rosser, was\r\npursuing closely, and routed it most completely, capturing eleven guns\r\nand a large number of prisoners.  Sheridan lost only about sixty men.\r\nHis cavalry pursued the enemy back some twenty-five miles.  On the 10th\r\nof October the march down the valley was again resumed, Early again\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nI now ordered Sheridan to halt, and to improve the opportunity if\r\nafforded by the enemy's having been sufficiently weakened, to move back\r\nagain and cut the James River Canal and Virginia Central Railroad.  But\r\nthis order had to go through Washington where it was intercepted; and\r\nwhen Sheridan received what purported to be a statement of what I wanted\r\nhim to do it was something entirely different.  Halleck informed\r\nSheridan that it was my wish for him to hold a forward position as a\r\nbase from which to act against Charlottesville and Gordonsville; that he\r\nshould fortify this position and provision it.\r\n\r\nSheridan objected to this most decidedly; and I was impelled to\r\ntelegraph him, on the 14th, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., October 14, 1864.--12.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Cedar Creek, Va.\r\n\r\nWhat I want is for you to threaten the Virginia Central Railroad and\r\ncanal in the manner your judgment tells you is best, holding yourself\r\nready to advance, if the enemy draw off their forces. If you make the\r\nenemy hold a force equal to your own for the protection of those\r\nthoroughfares, it will accomplish nearly as much as their destruction.\r\nIf you cannot do this, then the next best thing to do is to send here\r\nall the force you can.  I deem a good cavalry force necessary for your\r\noffensive, as well as defensive operations.  You need not therefore send\r\nhere more than one division of cavalry.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nSheridan having been summoned to Washington City, started on the 15th\r\nleaving Wright in command.  His army was then at Cedar Creek, some\r\ntwenty miles south of Winchester.  The next morning while at Front\r\nRoyal, Sheridan received a dispatch from Wright, saying that a dispatch\r\nfrom Longstreet to Early had been intercepted.  It directed the latter\r\nto be ready to move and to crush Sheridan as soon as he, Longstreet,\r\narrived.  On the receipt of this news Sheridan ordered the cavalry up\r\nthe valley to join Wright.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of October Early was ready to move, and during the night\r\nsucceeded in getting his troops in the rear of our left flank, which\r\nfled precipitately and in great confusion down the valley, losing\r\neighteen pieces of artillery and a thousand or more prisoners.  The\r\nright under General Getty maintained a firm and steady front, falling\r\nback to Middletown where it took a position and made a stand.  The\r\ncavalry went to the rear, seized the roads leading to Winchester and\r\nheld them for the use of our troops in falling back, General Wright\r\nhaving ordered a retreat back to that place.\r\n\r\nSheridan having left Washington on the 18th, reached Winchester that\r\nnight.  The following morning he started to join his command.  He had\r\nscarcely got out of town, when he met his men returning in panic from\r\nthe front and also heard heavy firing to the south.  He immediately\r\nordered the cavalry at Winchester to be deployed across the valley to\r\nstop the stragglers.  Leaving members of his staff to take care of\r\nWinchester and the public property there, he set out with a small escort\r\ndirectly for the scene of battle.  As he met the fugitives he ordered\r\nthem to turn back, reminding them that they were going the wrong way.\r\nHis presence soon restored confidence.  Finding themselves worse\r\nfrightened than hurt the men did halt and turn back.  Many of those who\r\nhad run ten miles got back in time to redeem their reputation as gallant\r\nsoldiers before night.\r\n\r\nWhen Sheridan got to the front he found Getty and Custer still holding\r\ntheir ground firmly between the Confederates and our retreating troops.\r\nEverything in the rear was now ordered up. Sheridan at once proceeded to\r\nintrench his position; and he awaited an assault from the enemy.  This\r\nwas made with vigor, and was directed principally against Emory's corps,\r\nwhich had sustained the principal loss in the first attack.  By one\r\no'clock the attack was repulsed.  Early was so badly damaged that he\r\nseemed disinclined to make another attack, but went to work to intrench\r\nhimself with a view to holding the position he had already gained.  He\r\nthought, no doubt, that Sheridan would be glad enough to leave him\r\nunmolested; but in this he was mistaken.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the afternoon Sheridan advanced.  He sent his\r\ncavalry by both flanks, and they penetrated to the enemy's rear.  The\r\ncontest was close for a time, but at length the left of the enemy broke,\r\nand disintegration along the whole line soon followed.  Early tried to\r\nrally his men, but they were followed so closely that they had to give\r\nway very quickly every time they attempted to make a stand.  Our\r\ncavalry, having pushed on and got in the rear of the Confederates,\r\ncaptured twenty-four pieces of artillery, besides retaking what had been\r\nlost in the morning.  This victory pretty much closed the campaigning in\r\nthe Valley of Virginia.  All the Confederate troops were sent back to\r\nRichmond with the exception of one division of infantry and a little\r\ncavalry.  Wright's corps was ordered back to the Army of the Potomac,\r\nand two other divisions were withdrawn from the valley.  Early had lost\r\nmore men in killed, wounded and captured in the valley than Sheridan had\r\ncommanded from first to last.\r\n\r\nOn more than one occasion in these engagements General R. B. Hayes, who\r\nsucceeded me as President of the United States, bore a very honorable\r\npart.  His conduct on the field was marked by conspicuous gallantry as\r\nwell as the display of qualities of a higher order than that of mere\r\npersonal daring.  This might well have been expected of one who could\r\nwrite at the time he is said to have done so:  \"Any officer fit for duty\r\nwho at this crisis would abandon his post to electioneer for a seat in\r\nCongress, ought to be scalped.\"  Having entered the army as a Major of\r\nVolunteers at the beginning of the war, General Hayes attained by\r\nmeritorious service the rank of Brevet Major-General before its close.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the James River the enemy attacked Kautz's cavalry\r\non the 7th of October, and drove it back with heavy loss in killed,\r\nwounded and prisoners, and the loss of all the artillery.  This was\r\nfollowed up by an attack on our intrenched infantry line, but was\r\nrepulsed with severe slaughter.  On the 13th a reconnoissance was sent\r\nout by General Butler, with a view to drive the enemy from some new\r\nworks he was constructing, which resulted in heavy loss to us.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th I ordered General Meade to attempt to get possession of the\r\nSouth Side Railroad, and for that purpose to advance on the 27th.  The\r\nattempt proved a failure, however, the most advanced of our troops not\r\ngetting nearer than within six miles of the point aimed for.  Seeing the\r\nimpossibility of its accomplishment I ordered the troops to withdraw,\r\nand they were all back in their former positions the next day.\r\n\r\nButler, by my directions, also made a demonstration on the north side of\r\nthe James River in order to support this move, by detaining there the\r\nConfederate troops who were on that side. He succeeded in this, but\r\nfailed of further results by not marching past the enemy's left before\r\nturning in on the Darby road and by reason of simply coming up against\r\ntheir lines in place.\r\n\r\nThis closed active operations around Richmond for the winter. Of course\r\nthere was frequent skirmishing between pickets, but no serious battle\r\nwas fought near either Petersburg or Richmond. It would prolong this\r\nwork to give a detailed account of all that took place from day to day\r\naround Petersburg and at other parts of my command, and it would not\r\ninterest the general reader if given.  All these details can be found by\r\nthe military student in a series of books published by the Scribners,\r\nBadeau's history of my campaigns, and also in the publications of the\r\nWar Department, including both the National and Confederate reports.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of November General Hancock was relieved from the\r\ncommand of the 2d corps by the Secretary of War and ordered to\r\nWashington, to organize and command a corps of veteran troops to be\r\ndesignated the 1st corps.  It was expected that this would give him a\r\nlarge command to co-operate with in the spring.  It was my expectation,\r\nat the time, that in the final operations Hancock should move either up\r\nthe valley, or else east of the Blue Ridge to Lynchburg; the idea being\r\nto make the spring campaign the close of the war.  I expected, with\r\nSherman coming up from the South, Meade south of Petersburg and around\r\nRichmond, and Thomas's command in Tennessee with depots of supplies\r\nestablished in the eastern part of that State, to move from the\r\ndirection of Washington or the valley towards Lynchburg.  We would then\r\nhave Lee so surrounded that his supplies would be cut off entirely,\r\nmaking it impossible for him to support his army.\r\n\r\nGeneral Humphreys, chief-of-staff of the Army of the Potomac, was\r\nassigned to the command of the 2d corps, to succeed Hancock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA--SHERMAN'S MARCH TO THE SEA--WAR ANECDOTES--THE\r\nMARCH ON SAVANNAH--INVESTMENT OF SAVANNAH--CAPTURE OF SAVANNAH.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the operations in the military division of the\r\nMississippi, and accompany Sherman in his march to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe possession of Atlanta by us narrowed the territory of the enemy very\r\nmaterially and cut off one of his two remaining lines of roads from east\r\nto west.\r\n\r\nA short time after the fall of Atlanta Mr. Davis visited Palmetto and\r\nMacon and made speeches at each place.  He spoke at Palmetto on the 20th\r\nof September, and at Macon on the 22d. Inasmuch as he had relieved\r\nJohnston and appointed Hood, and Hood had immediately taken the\r\ninitiative, it is natural to suppose that Mr. Davis was disappointed\r\nwith General Johnston's policy.  My own judgment is that Johnston acted\r\nvery wisely:  he husbanded his men and saved as much of his territory as\r\nhe could, without fighting decisive battles in which all might be lost.\r\nAs Sherman advanced, as I have show, his army became spread out, until,\r\nif this had been continued, it would have been easy to destroy it in\r\ndetail.  I know that both Sherman and I were rejoiced when we heard of\r\nthe change.  Hood was unquestionably a brave, gallant soldier and not\r\ndestitute of ability; but unfortunately his policy was to fight the\r\nenemy wherever he saw him, without thinking much of the consequences of\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nIn his speeches Mr. Davis denounced Governor Brown, of Georgia, and\r\nGeneral Johnston in unmeasured terms, even insinuating that their\r\nloyalty to the Southern cause was doubtful.  So far as General Johnston\r\nis concerned, I think Davis did him a great injustice in this\r\nparticular.  I had know the general before the war and strongly believed\r\nit would be impossible for him to accept a high commission for the\r\npurpose of betraying the cause he had espoused.  There, as I have said,\r\nI think that his policy was the best one that could have been pursued by\r\nthe whole South--protract the war, which was all that was necessary to\r\nenable them to gain recognition in the end.  The North was already\r\ngrowing weary, as the South evidently was also, but with this\r\ndifference.  In the North the people governed, and could stop\r\nhostilities whenever they chose to stop supplies.  The South was a\r\nmilitary camp, controlled absolutely by the government with soldiers to\r\nback it, and the war could have been protracted, no matter to what\r\nextent the discontent reached, up to the point of open mutiny of the\r\nsoldiers themselves.  Mr. Davis's speeches were frank appeals to the\r\npeople of Georgia and that portion of the South to come to their relief.\r\nHe tried to assure his frightened hearers that the Yankees were rapidly\r\ndigging their own graves; that measures were already being taken to cut\r\nthem off from supplies from the North; and that with a force in front,\r\nand cut off from the rear, they must soon starve in the midst of a\r\nhostile people.  Papers containing reports of these speeches immediately\r\nreached the Northern States, and they were republished.  Of course, that\r\ncaused no alarm so long as telegraphic communication was kept up with\r\nSherman.\r\n\r\nWhen Hood was forced to retreat from Atlanta he moved to the south-west\r\nand was followed by a portion of Sherman's army.  He soon appeared upon\r\nthe railroad in Sherman's rear, and with his whole army began destroying\r\nthe road.  At the same time also the work was begun in Tennessee and\r\nKentucky which Mr. Davis had assured his hearers at Palmetto and Macon\r\nwould take place.  He ordered Forrest (about the ablest cavalry general\r\nin the South) north for this purpose; and Forrest and Wheeler carried\r\nout their orders with more or less destruction, occasionally picking up\r\na garrison.  Forrest indeed performed the very remarkable feat of\r\ncapturing, with cavalry, two gunboats and a number of transports,\r\nsomething the accomplishment of which is very hard to account for.\r\nHood's army had been weakened by Governor Brown's withdrawing the\r\nGeorgia State troops for the purpose of gathering in the season's crops\r\nfor the use of the people and for the use of the army.  This not only\r\ndepleted Hood's forces but it served a most excellent purpose in\r\ngathering in supplies of food and forage for the use of our army in its\r\nsubsequent march.  Sherman was obliged to push on with his force and go\r\nhimself with portions of it hither and thither, until it was clearly\r\ndemonstrated to him that with the army he then had it would be\r\nimpossible to hold the line from Atlanta back and leave him any force\r\nwhatever with which to take the offensive.  Had that plan been adhered\r\nto, very large reinforcements would have been necessary; and Mr. Davis's\r\nprediction of the destruction of the army would have been realized, or\r\nelse Sherman would have been obliged to make a successful retreat, which\r\nMr. Davis said in his speeches would prove more disastrous than\r\nNapoleon's retreat from Moscow.\r\n\r\nThese speeches of Mr. Davis were not long in reaching Sherman. He took\r\nadvantage of the information they gave, and made all the preparation\r\npossible for him to make to meet what now became expected, attempts to\r\nbreak his communications.  Something else had to be done:  and to\r\nSherman's sensible and soldierly mind the idea was not long in dawning\r\nupon him, not only that something else had to be done, but what that\r\nsomething else should be.\r\n\r\nOn September 10th I telegraphed Sherman as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., Sept. 10, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\nSo soon as your men are sufficiently rested, and preparations can be\r\nmade, it is desirable that another campaign should be commenced.  We\r\nwant to keep the enemy constantly pressed to the end of the war.  If we\r\ngive him no peace whilst the war lasts, the end cannot be distant.  Now\r\nthat we have all of Mobile Bay that is valuable, I do not know but it\r\nwill be the best move to transfer Canby's troops to act upon Savannah,\r\nwhilst you move on Augusta. I should like to hear from you, however, in\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nSherman replied promptly:\r\n\r\n\"If I could be sure of finding provisions and ammunition at Augusta, or\r\nColumbus, Georgia, I can march to Milledgeville, and compel Hood to give\r\nup Augusta or Macon, and then turn on the other.  * * * If you can\r\nmanage to take the Savannah River as high up as Augusta, or the\r\nChattahoochee as far up as Columbus, I can sweep the whole State of\r\nGeorgia.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th I sent a special messenger, one of my own staff, with a\r\nletter inviting Sherman's views about the next campaign.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., Sept. 12, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL W. T.  SHERMAN, Commanding Mill Division of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nI send Lieutenant-Colonel Porter, of my staff, with this. Colonel Porter\r\nwill explain to you the exact condition of affairs here better than I\r\ncan do in the limits of a letter. Although I feel myself strong enough\r\nfor offensive operations, I am holding on quietly to get advantage of\r\nrecruits and convalescents, who are coming forward very rapidly.  My\r\nlines are necessarily very long, extending from Deep Bottom north of the\r\nJames across the peninsula formed by the Appomattox and the James, and\r\nsouth of the Appomattox to the Weldon Road.  This line is very strongly\r\nfortified, and can be held with comparatively few men, but from its\r\ngreat length takes many in the aggregate.  I propose, when I do move, to\r\nextend my left so as to control what is known as the South Side, or\r\nLynchburg and Petersburg Road, then if possible to keep the Danville\r\nRoad cut.  At the same time this move is made, I want to send a force of\r\nfrom six to ten thousand men against Wilmington.\r\n\r\nThe way I propose to do this is to land the men north of Fort Fisher,\r\nand hold that point.  At the same time a large naval fleet will be\r\nassembled there, and the iron-clads will run the batteries as they did\r\nat Mobile.  This will give us the same control of the harbor of\r\nWilmington that we now have of the harbor of Mobile. What you are to do\r\nwith the forces at your command, I do not see. The difficulties of\r\nsupplying your army, except when you are constantly moving, beyond where\r\nyou are, I plainly see.  If it had not been for Price's movements Canby\r\nwould have sent twelve thousand more men to Mobile.  From your command\r\non the Mississippi an equal number could have been taken.  With these\r\nforces my idea would have been to divide them, sending one half to\r\nMobile and the other half to Savannah.  You could then move as proposed\r\nin your telegram, so as to threaten Macon and Augusta equally.\r\nWhichever was abandoned by the enemy you could take and open up a new\r\nbase of supplies.  My object now in sending a staff officer is not so\r\nmuch to suggest operations for you, as to get your views and have plans\r\nmatured by the time everything can be got ready.  It will probably be\r\nthe 5th of October before any of the plans herein indicated will be\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nIf you have any promotions to recommend, send the names forward and I\r\nwill approve them. * * *\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis reached Sherman on September 20th.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of September Sherman reported to Washington that Hood's\r\ntroops were in his rear.  He had provided against this by sending a\r\ndivision to Chattanooga and a division to Rome, Georgia, which was in\r\nthe rear of Hood, supposing that Hood would fall back in the direction\r\nfrom which he had come to reach the railroad.  At the same time Sherman\r\nand Hood kept up a correspondence relative to the exchange of prisoners,\r\nthe treatment of citizens, and other matters suitable to be arranged\r\nbetween hostile commanders in the field.  On the 27th of September I\r\ntelegraphed Sherman as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., September 27, 1864--10.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN:\r\n\r\nI have directed all recruits and new troops from the Western States to\r\nbe sent to Nashville, to receive their further orders from you.  * * *\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 29th Sherman sent Thomas back to Chattanooga, and afterwards to\r\nNashville, with another division (Morgan's) of the advanced army.\r\nSherman then suggested that, when he was prepared, his movements should\r\ntake place against Milledgeville and then to Savannah.  His expectation\r\nat that time was, to make this movement as soon as he could get up his\r\nsupplies.  Hood was moving in his own country, and was moving light so\r\nthat he could make two miles to Sherman's one.  He depended upon the\r\ncountry to gather his supplies, and so was not affected by delays.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, until this unexpected state of affairs happened, Mobile\r\nhad been looked upon as the objective point of Sherman's army.  It had\r\nbeen a favorite move of mine from 1862, when I first suggested to the\r\nthen commander-in-chief that the troops in Louisiana, instead of\r\nfrittering away their time in the trans-Mississippi, should move\r\nagainst Mobile.  I recommended this from time to time until I came into\r\ncommand of the army, the last of March 1864.  Having the power in my own\r\nhands, I now ordered the concentration of supplies, stores and troops,\r\nin the department of the Gulf about New Orleans, with a view to a move\r\nagainst Mobile, in support of, and in conjunction with, the other armies\r\noperating in the field.  Before I came into command, these troops had\r\nbeen scattered over the trans-Mississippi department in such a way that\r\nthey could not be, or were not, gotten back in time to take any part in\r\nthe original movement; hence the consideration, which had caused Mobile\r\nto be selected as the objective point for Sherman's army to find his\r\nnext base of supplies after having cut loose from Atlanta, no longer\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nGeneral G. M. Dodge, an exceedingly efficient officer, having been badly\r\nwounded, had to leave the army about the first of October. He was in\r\ncommand of two divisions of the 16th corps, consolidated into one.\r\nSherman then divided his army into the right and left wings the right\r\ncommanded by General O. O. Howard and the left by General Slocum.\r\nGeneral Dodge's two divisions were assigned, one to each of these wings.\r\nHoward's command embraced the 15th and 17th corps, and Slocum's the 14th\r\nand 20th corps, commanded by Generals Jeff. C. Davis and A. S. Williams.\r\nGenerals Logan and Blair commanded the two corps composing the right\r\nwing.  About this time they left to take part in the presidential\r\nelection, which took place that year, leaving their corps to Osterhaus\r\nand Ransom.  I have no doubt that their leaving was at the earnest\r\nsolicitation of the War Department. General Blair got back in time to\r\nresume his command and to proceed with it throughout the march to the\r\nsea and back to the grand review at Washington.  General Logan did not\r\nreturn to his command until after it reached Savannah.\r\n\r\nLogan felt very much aggrieved at the transfer of General Howard from\r\nthat portion of the Army of the Potomac which was then with the Western\r\nArmy, to the command of the Army of the Tennessee, with which army\r\nGeneral Logan had served from the battle of Belmont to the fall of\r\nAtlanta--having passed successively through all grades from colonel\r\ncommanding a regiment to general commanding a brigade, division and army\r\ncorps, until upon the death of McPherson the command of the entire Army\r\nof the Tennessee devolved upon him in the midst of a hotly contested\r\nbattle.  He conceived that he had done his full duty as commander in\r\nthat engagement; and I can bear testimony, from personal observation,\r\nthat he had proved himself fully equal to all the lower positions which\r\nhe had occupied as a soldier.  I will not pretend to question the motive\r\nwhich actuated Sherman in taking an officer from another army to\r\nsupersede General Logan.  I have no doubt, whatever, that he did this\r\nfor what he considered would be to the good of the service, which was\r\nmore important than that the personal feelings of any individual should\r\nnot be aggrieved; though I doubt whether he had an officer with him who\r\ncould have filled the place as Logan would have done.  Differences of\r\nopinion must exist between the best of friends as to policies in war,\r\nand of judgment as to men's fitness.  The officer who has the command,\r\nhowever, should be allowed to judge of the fitness of the officers under\r\nhim, unless he is very manifestly wrong.\r\n\r\nSherman's army, after all the depletions, numbered about sixty thousand\r\neffective men.  All weak men had been left to hold the rear, and those\r\nremaining were not only well men, but strong and hardy, so that he had\r\nsixty thousand as good soldiers as ever trod the earth; better than any\r\nEuropean soldiers, because they not only worked like a machine but the\r\nmachine thought. European armies know very little what they are fighting\r\nfor, and care less. Included in these sixty thousand troops, there were\r\ntwo small divisions of cavalry, numbering altogether about four thousand\r\nmen.  Hood had about thirty-five to forty thousand men, independent of\r\nForrest, whose forces were operating in Tennessee and Kentucky, as Mr.\r\nDavis had promised they should.  This part of Mr. Davis's military plan\r\nwas admirable, and promised the best results of anything he could have\r\ndone, according to my judgment. I say this because I have criticised his\r\nmilitary judgment in the removal of Johnston, and also in the\r\nappointment of Hood.  I am aware, however, that there was high feeling\r\nexisting at that time between Davis and his subordinate, whom I regarded\r\nas one of his ablest lieutenants.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of October the railroad back from Atlanta was again very\r\nbadly broken, Hood having got on the track with his army. Sherman saw\r\nafter night, from a high point, the road burning for miles.  The defence\r\nof the railroad by our troops was very gallant, but they could not hold\r\npoints between their intrenched positions against Hood's whole army; in\r\nfact they made no attempt to do so; but generally the intrenched\r\npositions were held, as well as important bridges, and store located at\r\nthem. Allatoona, for instance, was defended by a small force of men\r\nunder the command of General Corse, one of the very able and efficient\r\nvolunteer officers produced by the war.  He, with a small force, was cut\r\noff from the remainder of the National army and was attacked with great\r\nvigor by many times his own number. Sherman from his high position could\r\nsee the battle raging, with the Confederate troops between him and his\r\nsubordinate.  He sent men, of course, to raise the temporary siege, but\r\nthe time that would be necessarily consumed in reaching Corse, would be\r\nso great that all occupying the intrenchments might be dead.  Corse was\r\na man who would never surrender.  From a high position some of Sherman's\r\nsignal corps discovered a signal flag waving from a hole in the block\r\nhouse at Allatoona.  It was from Corse.  He had been shot through the\r\nface, but he signalled to his chief a message which left no doubt of his\r\ndetermination to hold his post at all hazards.  It was at this point\r\nprobably, that Sherman first realized that with the forces at his\r\ndisposal, the keeping open of his line of communication with the North\r\nwould be impossible if he expected to retain any force with which to\r\noperate offensively beyond Atlanta.  He proposed, therefore, to destroy\r\nthe roads back to Chattanooga, when all ready to move, and leave the\r\nlatter place garrisoned.  Yet, before abandoning the railroad, it was\r\nnecessary that he should repair damages already done, and hold the road\r\nuntil he could get forward such supplies, ordnance stores and small\r\nrations, as he wanted to carry with him on his proposed march, and to\r\nreturn to the north his surplus artillery; his object being to move\r\nlight and to have no more artillery than could be used to advantage on\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nSherman thought Hood would follow him, though he proposed to prepare for\r\nthe contingency of the latter moving the other way while he was moving\r\nsouth, by making Thomas strong enough to hold Tennessee and Kentucky.\r\nI, myself, was thoroughly satisfied that Hood would go north, as he did.\r\nOn the 2d of November I telegraphed Sherman authorizing him definitely\r\nto move according to the plan he had proposed:  that is, cutting loose\r\nfrom his base, giving up Atlanta and the railroad back to Chattanooga.\r\nTo strengthen Thomas he sent Stanley (4th corps) back, and also ordered\r\nSchofield, commanding the Army of the Ohio, twelve thousand strong, to\r\nreport to him.  In addition to this, A. J. Smith, who, with two\r\ndivisions of Sherman's army, was in Missouri aiding Rosecrans in driving\r\nthe enemy from that State, was under orders to return to Thomas and,\r\nunder the most unfavorable circumstances, might be expected to arrive\r\nthere long before Hood could reach Nashville.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the new levies of troops that were being raised in\r\nthe  North-west went to Thomas as rapidly as enrolled and equipped.\r\nThomas, without any of these additions spoken of, had a garrison at\r\nChattanooga which had been strengthened by one division and garrisons at\r\nBridgeport, Stevenson, Decatur, Murfreesboro, and Florence.  There were\r\nalready with him in Nashville ten thousand soldiers in round numbers,\r\nand many thousands of employees in the quartermaster's and other\r\ndepartments who could be put in the intrenchments in front of Nashville,\r\nfor its defence.  Also, Wilson was there with ten thousand dismounted\r\ncavalrymen, who were being equipped for the field.  Thomas had at this\r\ntime about forty-five thousand men without any of the reinforcements\r\nhere above enumerated.  These reinforcements gave him  altogether about\r\nseventy thousand men, without counting what might be added by the new\r\nlevies already spoken of.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Beauregard arrived upon the field, not to supersede Hood\r\nin command, but to take general charge over the entire district in which\r\nHood and Sherman were, or might be, operating.  He made the most frantic\r\nappeals to the citizens for assistance to be rendered in every way:  by\r\nsending reinforcements, by destroying supplies on the line of march of\r\nthe invaders, by destroying the bridges over which they would have to\r\ncross, and by, in every way, obstructing the roads to their front. But\r\nit was hard to convince the people of the propriety of destroying\r\nsupplies which were so much needed by themselves, and each one hoped\r\nthat his own possessions might escape.\r\n\r\nHood soon started north, and went into camp near Decatur, Alabama, where\r\nhe remained until the 29th of October, but without making an attack on\r\nthe garrison of that place.\r\n\r\nThe Tennessee River was patrolled by gunboats, from Muscle Shoals east;\r\nand, also, below the second shoals out to the Ohio River.  These, with\r\nthe troops that might be concentrated from the garrisons along the river\r\nat any point where Hood might choose to attempt to cross, made it\r\nimpossible for him to cross the Tennessee at any place where it was\r\nnavigable.  But Muscle Shoals is not navigable, and below them again is\r\nanother shoal which also obstructs navigation.  Hood therefore moved\r\ndown to a point nearly opposite Florence, Alabama, crossed over and\r\nremained there for some time, collecting supplies of food, forage and\r\nammunition. All of these had to come from a considerable distance south,\r\nbecause the region in which he was then situated was mountainous, with\r\nsmall valleys which produced but little, and what they had produced had\r\nlong since been exhausted.  On the 1st of November I suggested to\r\nSherman, and also asked his views thereon, the propriety of destroying\r\nHood before he started on his campaign.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of November, as stated, I approved definitely his making his\r\nproposed campaign through Georgia, leaving Hood behind to the tender\r\nmercy of Thomas and the troops in his command.  Sherman fixed the 10th\r\nof November as the day of starting.\r\n\r\nSherman started on that day to get back to Atlanta, and on the 15th the\r\nreal march to the sea commenced.  The right wing, under Howard, and the\r\ncavalry went to Jonesboro, Milledgeville, then the capital of Georgia,\r\nbeing Sherman's objective or stopping place on the way to Savannah.  The\r\nleft wing moved to Stone Mountain, along roads much farther east than\r\nthose taken by the right wing. Slocum was in command, and threatened\r\nAugusta as the point to which he was moving, but he was to turn off and\r\nmeet the right wing at Milledgeville.\r\n\r\nAtlanta was destroyed so far as to render it worthless for military\r\npurposes before starting, Sherman himself remaining over a day to\r\nsuperintend the work, and see that it was well done. Sherman's orders\r\nfor this campaign were perfect.  Before starting, he had sent back all\r\nsick, disabled and weak men, retaining nothing but the hardy,\r\nwell-inured soldiers to accompany him on his long march in prospect.\r\nHis artillery was reduced to sixty-five guns. The ammunition carried\r\nwith them was two hundred rounds for musket and gun.  Small rations were\r\ntaken in a small wagon train, which was loaded to its capacity for rapid\r\nmovement.  The army was expected to live on the country, and to always\r\nkeep the wagons full of forage and provisions against a possible delay\r\nof a few days.\r\n\r\nThe troops, both of the right and left wings, made most of their advance\r\nalong the line of railroads, which they destroyed.  The method adopted\r\nto perform this work, was to burn and destroy all the bridges and\r\nculverts, and for a long distance, at places, to tear up the track and\r\nbend the rails.  Soldiers to do this rapidly would form a line along one\r\nside of the road with crowbars and poles, place these under the rails\r\nand, hoisting all at once, turn over many rods of road at one time.  The\r\nties would then be placed in piles, and the rails, as they were\r\nloosened, would be carried and put across these log heaps.  When a\r\nsufficient number of rails were placed upon a pile of ties it would be\r\nset on fire.  This would heat the rails very much more in the middle,\r\nthat being over the main part of the fire, than at the ends, so that\r\nthey would naturally bend of their own weight; but the soldiers, to\r\nincrease the damage, would take tongs and, one or two men at each end of\r\nthe rail, carry it with force against the nearest tree and twist it\r\naround, thus leaving rails forming bands to ornament the forest trees of\r\nGeorgia. All this work was going on at the same time, there being a\r\nsufficient number of men detailed for that purpose. Some piled the logs\r\nand built the fire; some put the rails upon the fire; while others would\r\nbend those that were sufficiently heated: so that, by the time the last\r\nbit of road was torn up, that it was designed to destroy at a certain\r\nplace, the rails previously taken up were already destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe organization for supplying the army was very complete.  Each brigade\r\nfurnished a company to gather supplies of forage and provisions for the\r\ncommand to which they belonged.  Strict injunctions were issued against\r\npillaging, or otherwise unnecessarily annoying the people; but\r\neverything in shape of food for man and forage for beast was taken.  The\r\nsupplies were turned over to the brigade commissary and quartermaster,\r\nand were issued by them to their respective commands precisely the same\r\nas if they had been purchased.  The captures consisted largely of\r\ncattle, sheep, poultry, some bacon, cornmeal, often molasses, and\r\noccasionally coffee or other small rations.\r\n\r\nThe skill of these men, called by themselves and the army \"bummers,\" in\r\ncollecting their loads and getting back to their respective commands,\r\nwas marvellous.  When they started out in the morning, they were always\r\non foot; but scarcely one of them returned in the evening without being\r\nmounted on a horse or mule. These would be turned in for the general use\r\nof the army, and the next day these men would start out afoot and return\r\nagain in the evening mounted.\r\n\r\nMany of the exploits of these men would fall under the head of romance;\r\nindeed, I am afraid that in telling some of their experiences, the\r\nromance got the better of the truth upon which the story was founded,\r\nand that, in the way many of these anecdotes are told, very little of\r\nthe foundation is left.  I suspect that most of them consist chiefly of\r\nthe fiction added to make the stories better.  In one instance it was\r\nreported that a few men of Sherman's army passed a house where they\r\ndiscovered some chickens under the dwelling.  They immediately proceeded\r\nto capture them, to add to the army's supplies.  The lady of the house,\r\nwho happened to be at home, made piteous appeals to have these spared,\r\nsaying they were a few she had put away to save by permission of other\r\nparties who had preceded and who had taken all the others that she had.\r\nThe soldiers seemed moved at her appeal; but looking at the chickens\r\nagain they were tempted and one of them replied:  \"The rebellion must be\r\nsuppressed if it takes the last chicken in the Confederacy,\" and\r\nproceeded to appropriate the last one.\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote characteristic of these times has been told. The South,\r\nprior to the rebellion, kept bloodhounds to pursue runaway slaves who\r\ntook refuge in the neighboring swamps, and also to hunt convicts.\r\nOrders were issued to kill all these animals as they were met with.  On\r\none occasion a soldier picked up a poodle, the favorite pet of its\r\nmistress, and was carrying it off to execution when the lady made a\r\nstrong appeal to him to spare it. The soldier replied, \"Madam, our\r\norders are to kill every bloodhound.\"  \"But this is not a bloodhound,\"\r\nsaid the lady.  \"Well, madam, we cannot tell what it will grow into if\r\nwe leave it behind,\" said the soldier as he went off with it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these anecdotes, and the necessary hardship they would\r\nseem to imply, I do not believe there was much unwarrantable pillaging\r\nconsidering that we were in the enemy's territory and without any\r\nsupplies except such as the country afforded.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d Sherman, with the left wing, reached Milledgeville. The right\r\nwing was not far off:  but proceeded on its way towards Savannah\r\ndestroying the road as it went.  The troops at Milledgeville remained\r\nover a day to destroy factories, buildings used for military purposes,\r\netc., before resuming its march.\r\n\r\nThe governor, who had been almost defying Mr. Davis before this, now\r\nfled precipitately, as did the legislature of the State and all the\r\nState officers.  The governor, Sherman says, was careful to carry away\r\neven his garden vegetables, while he left the archives of the State to\r\nfall into our hands.  The only military force that was opposed to\r\nSherman's forward march was the Georgia militia, a division under the\r\ncommand of General G. W. Smith, and a battalion under Harry Wayne.\r\nNeither the quality of the forces nor their numbers was sufficient to\r\neven retard the progress of Sherman's army.\r\n\r\nThe people at the South became so frantic at this time at the successful\r\ninvasion of Georgia that they took the cadets from the military college\r\nand added them to the ranks of the militia.  They even liberated the\r\nState convicts under promise from them that they would serve in the\r\narmy.  I have but little doubt that the worst acts that were attributed\r\nto Sherman's army were committed by these convicts, and by other\r\nSouthern people who ought to have been under sentence--such people as\r\ncould be found in every community, North and South--who took advantage\r\nof their country being invaded to commit crime.  They were in but little\r\ndanger of detection, or of arrest even if detected.\r\n\r\nThe Southern papers in commenting upon Sherman's movements pictured him\r\nas in the most deplorable condition:  stating that his men were\r\nstarving, that they were demoralized and wandering about almost without\r\nobject, aiming only to reach the sea coast and get under the protection\r\nof our navy.  These papers got to the North and had more or less effect\r\nupon the minds of the people, causing much distress to all loyal persons\r\nparticularly to those who had husbands, sons or brothers with Sherman.\r\nMr. Lincoln seeing these accounts, had a letter written asking me if I\r\ncould give him anything that he could say to the loyal people that would\r\ncomfort them.  I told him there was not the slightest occasion for\r\nalarm; that with 60,000 such men as Sherman had with him, such a\r\ncommanding officer as he was could not be cut off in the open country.\r\nHe might possibly be prevented from reaching the point he had started\r\nout to reach, but he would get through somewhere and would finally get\r\nto his chosen destination:  and even if worst came to worst he could\r\nreturn North.  I heard afterwards of Mr. Lincoln's saying, to those who\r\nwould inquire of him as to what he thought about the safety of Sherman's\r\narmy, that Sherman was all right:  \"Grant says they are safe with such a\r\ngeneral, and that if they cannot get out where they want to, they can\r\ncrawl back by the hole they went in at.\"\r\n\r\nWhile at Milledgeville the soldiers met at the State House, organized a\r\nlegislature, and proceeded to business precisely as if they were the\r\nlegislative body belonging to the State of Georgia. The debates were\r\nexciting, and were upon the subject of the situation the South was in at\r\nthat time, particularly the State of Georgia.  They went so far as to\r\nrepeal, after a spirited and acrimonious debate, the ordinance of\r\nsecession.\r\n\r\nThe next day (24th) Sherman continued his march, going by the way of\r\nWaynesboro and Louisville, Millen being the next objective and where the\r\ntwo columns (the right and left wings) were to meet.  The left wing\r\nmoved to the left of the direct road, and the cavalry still farther off\r\nso as to make it look as though Augusta was the point they were aiming\r\nfor.  They moved on all the roads they could find leading in that\r\ndirection.  The cavalry was sent to make a rapid march in hope of\r\nsurprising Millen before the Union prisoners could be carried away; but\r\nthey failed in this.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Milledgeville to Millen was about one hundred miles.\r\nAt this point Wheeler, who had been ordered from Tennessee, arrived and\r\nswelled the numbers and efficiency of the troops confronting Sherman.\r\nHardee, a native of Georgia, also came, but brought no troops with him.\r\nIt was intended that he should raise as large an army as possible with\r\nwhich to intercept Sherman's march.  He did succeed in raising some\r\ntroops, and with these and those under the command of Wheeler and Wayne,\r\nhad an army sufficient to cause some annoyance but no great detention.\r\nOur cavalry and Wheeler's had a pretty severe engagement, in which\r\nWheeler was driven towards Augusta, thus giving the idea that Sherman\r\nwas probably making for that point.\r\n\r\nMillen was reached on the 3d of December, and the march was resumed the\r\nfollowing day for Savannah, the final objective. Bragg had now been sent\r\nto Augusta with some troops.  Wade Hampton was there also trying to\r\nraise cavalry sufficient to destroy Sherman's army.  If he ever raised a\r\nforce it was too late to do the work expected of it.  Hardee's whole\r\nforce probably numbered less than ten thousand men.\r\n\r\nFrom Millen to Savannah the country is sandy and poor, and affords but\r\nvery little forage other than rice straw, which was then growing.  This\r\nanswered a very good purpose as forage, and the rice grain was an\r\naddition to the soldier's rations.  No further resistance worthy of note\r\nwas met with, until within a few miles of Savannah.  This place was\r\nfound to be intrenched and garrisoned.  Sherman proceeded at once on his\r\narrival to invest the place, and found that the enemy had placed\r\ntorpedoes in the ground, which were to explode when stepped on by man or\r\nbeast. One of these exploded under an officer's horse, blowing the\r\nanimal to pieces and tearing one of the legs of the officer so badly\r\nthat it had to be amputated.  Sherman at once ordered his prisoners to\r\nthe front, moving them in a compact body in advance, to either explode\r\nthe torpedoes or dig them up.  No further explosion took place.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December the siege of Savannah commenced. Sherman then,\r\nbefore proceeding any further with operations for the capture of the\r\nplace, started with some troops to open communication with our fleet,\r\nwhich he expected to find in the lower harbor or as near by as the forts\r\nof the enemy would permit. In marching to the coast he encountered Fort\r\nMcAllister, which it was necessary to reduce before the supplies he\r\nmight find on shipboard could be made available.  Fort McAllister was\r\nsoon captured by an assault made by General Hazen's division.\r\nCommunication was then established with the fleet.  The capture of\r\nSavannah then only occupied a few days, and involved no great loss of\r\nlife.  The garrison, however, as we shall see, was enabled to escape by\r\ncrossing the river and moving eastward.\r\n\r\nWhen Sherman had opened communication with the fleet he found there a\r\nsteamer, which I had forwarded to him, carrying the accumulated mails\r\nfor his army, also supplies which I supposed he would be in need of.\r\nGeneral J. G. Foster, who commanded all the troops south of North\r\nCarolina on the Atlantic sea-board, visited General Sherman before he\r\nhad opened communication with the fleet, with the view of ascertaining\r\nwhat assistance he could be to him.  Foster returned immediately to his\r\nown headquarters at Hilton Head, for the purpose of sending Sherman\r\nsiege guns, and also if he should find he had them to spare, supplies of\r\nclothing, hard bread, etc., thinking that these articles might not be\r\nfound outside.  The mail on the steamer which I sent down, had been\r\ncollected by Colonel A. H. Markland of the Post Office Department, who\r\nwent in charge of it.  On this same vessel I sent an officer of my staff\r\n(Lieutenant Dunn) with the following letter to General Sherman:\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., Dec. 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL W. T.  SHERMAN, Commanding Armies near Savannah, Ga.\r\n\r\nThe little information gleaned from the Southern press, indicating no\r\ngreat obstacle to your progress, I have directed your mails (which had\r\nbeen previously collected at Baltimore by Colonel Markland, Special\r\nAgent of the Post Office Department) to be sent as far as the blockading\r\nsquadron off Savannah, to be forwarded to you as soon as heard from on\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nNot liking to rejoice before the victory is assured, I abstain from\r\ncongratulating you and those under your command, until bottom has been\r\nstruck.  I have never had a fear, however, for the result.\r\n\r\nSince you left Atlanta, no very great progress has been made here. The\r\nenemy has been closely watched though, and prevented from detaching\r\nagainst you.  I think not one man has gone from here, except some twelve\r\nor fifteen hundred dismounted cavalry.  Bragg has gone from Wilmington.\r\nI am trying to take advantage of his absence to get possession of that\r\nplace.  Owing to some preparations Admiral Porter and General Butler are\r\nmaking to blow up Fort Fisher (which, while hoping for the best, I do\r\nnot believe a particle in), there is a delay in getting this expedition\r\noff.  I hope they will be ready to start by the 7th, and that Bragg will\r\nnot have started back by that time.\r\n\r\nIn this letter I do not intend to give you anything like directions for\r\nfuture action, but will state a general idea I have, and will get your\r\nviews after you have established yourself on the sea-coast. With your\r\nveteran army I hope to get control of the only two through routes from\r\neast to west possessed by the enemy before the fall of Atlanta.  The\r\ncondition will be filled by holding Savannah and Augusta, or by holding\r\nany other port to the east of Savannah and Branchville.  If Wilmington\r\nfalls, a force from there can co-operate with you.\r\n\r\nThomas has got back into the defences of Nashville, with Hood close upon\r\nhim.  Decatur has been abandoned, and so have all the roads except the\r\nmain one leading to Chattanooga.  Part of this falling back was\r\nundoubtedly necessary and all of it may have been.  It did not look so,\r\nhowever, to me.  In my opinion, Thomas far outnumbers Hood in infantry.\r\nIn cavalry, Hood has the advantage in morale and numbers.  I hope yet\r\nthat Hood will be badly crippled if not destroyed.  The general news you\r\nwill learn from the papers better than I could give it.\r\n\r\nAfter all becomes quiet, and roads become so bad up here that there is\r\nlikely to be a week or two when nothing can be done, I will run down the\r\ncoast to see you.  If you desire it, I will ask Mrs. Sherman to go with\r\nme.\r\n\r\nYours truly, U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General\r\n\r\n\r\nI quote this letter because it gives the reader a full knowledge of the\r\nevents of that period.\r\n\r\nSherman now (the 15th) returned to Savannah to complete its investment\r\nand insure the surrender of the garrison.  The country about Savannah is\r\nlow and marshy, and the city was well intrenched from the river above to\r\nthe river below; and assaults could not be made except along a\r\ncomparatively narrow causeway. For this reason assaults must have\r\nresulted in serious destruction of life to the Union troops, with the\r\nchance of failing altogether. Sherman therefore decided upon a complete\r\ninvestment of the place.  When he believed this investment completed, he\r\nsummoned the garrison to surrender.  General Hardee, who was in command,\r\nreplied in substance that the condition of affairs was not such as\r\nSherman had described.  He said he was in full communication with his\r\ndepartment and was receiving supplies constantly.\r\n\r\nHardee, however, was cut off entirely from all communication with the\r\nwest side of the river, and by the river itself to the north and south.\r\nOn the South Carolina side the country was all rice fields, through\r\nwhich it would have been impossible to bring supplies so that Hardee had\r\nno possible communication with the outside world except by a dilapidated\r\nplank road starting from the west bank of the river.  Sherman, receiving\r\nthis reply, proceeded in person to a point on the coast, where General\r\nFoster had troops stationed under General Hatch, for the purpose of\r\nmaking arrangements with the latter officer to go through by one of the\r\nnumerous channels running inland along that part of the coast of South\r\nCarolina, to the plank road which General Hardee still possessed, and\r\nthus to cut him off from the last means he had of getting supplies, if\r\nnot of communication.\r\n\r\nWhile arranging for this movement, and before the attempt to execute the\r\nplan had been commenced, Sherman received information through one of his\r\nstaff officers that the enemy had evacuated Savannah the night before.\r\nThis was the night of the 21st of December.  Before evacuating the place\r\nHardee had blown up the navy yard.  Some iron-clads had been destroyed,\r\nas well as other property that might have been valuable to us; but he\r\nleft an immense amount of stores untouched, consisting of cotton,\r\nrailroad cars, workshops, numerous pieces of artillery, and several\r\nthousand stands of small arms.\r\n\r\nA little incident occurred, soon after the fall of Savannah, which\r\nSherman relates in his Memoirs, and which is worthy of repetition.\r\nSavannah was one of the points where blockade runners entered. Shortly\r\nafter the city fell into our possession, a blockade runner came sailing\r\nup serenely, not doubting but the Confederates were still in possession.\r\nIt was not molested, and the captain did not find out his mistake until\r\nhe had tied up and gone to the Custom House, where he found a new\r\noccupant of the building, and made a less profitable disposition of his\r\nvessel and cargo than he had expected.\r\n\r\nAs there was some discussion as to the authorship of Sherman's march to\r\nthe sea, by critics of his book when it appeared before the public, I\r\nwant to state here that no question upon that subject was ever raised\r\nbetween General Sherman and myself. Circumstances made the plan on which\r\nSherman expected to act impracticable, as as commander of the forces he\r\nnecessarily had to devise a new on which would give more promise of\r\nsuccess: consequently he recommended the destruction of the railroad\r\nback to Chattanooga, and that he should be authorized then to move, as\r\nhe did, from Atlanta forward.  His suggestions were finally approved,\r\nalthough they did not immediately find favor in Washington.  Even when\r\nit came to the time of starting, the greatest apprehension, as to the\r\npropriety of the campaign he was about commence, filled the mind of the\r\nPresident, induced no doubt by his advisers.  This went so far as to\r\nmove the President to ask me to suspend Sherman's march for a day or two\r\nuntil I could think the matter over.  My recollection is, though I find\r\nno record to show it, that out of deference to the President's wish I\r\ndid send a dispatch to Sherman asking him to wait a day or two, or else\r\nthe connections between us were already cut so that I could not do so.\r\nHowever this may be, the question of who devised the plan of march from\r\nAtlanta to Savannah is easily answered:  it was clearly Sherman, and to\r\nhim also belongs the credit of its brilliant execution.  It was hardly\r\npossible that any one else than those on the spot could have devised a\r\nnew plan of campaign to supersede one that did not promise success.\r\n(*40)\r\n\r\nI was in favor of Sherman's plan from the time it was first submitted to\r\nme.  My chief of staff, however, was very bitterly opposed to it and, as\r\nI learned subsequently, finding that he could not move me, he appealed\r\nto the authorities at Washington to stop it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF FRANKLIN--THE BATTLE OF NASHVILLE.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Hood succeeded in crossing the Tennessee River between\r\nMuscle Shoals and the lower shoals at the end of October, 1864.  Thomas\r\nsent Schofield with the 4th and 23d corps, together with three brigades\r\nof Wilson's cavalry to Pulaski to watch him.  On the 17th of November\r\nHood started and moved in such a manner as to avoid Schofield, thereby\r\nturning his position.  Hood had with him three infantry corps, commanded\r\nrespectively by Stephen D. Lee, Stewart and Cheatham.  These, with his\r\ncavalry, numbered about forty-five thousand men. Schofield had, of all\r\narms, about thirty thousand.  Thomas's orders were, therefore, for\r\nSchofield to watch the movements of the enemy, but not to fight a battle\r\nif he could avoid it; but to fall back in case of an advance on\r\nNashville, and to fight the enemy, as he fell back, so as to retard the\r\nenemy's movements until he could be reinforced by Thomas himself.  As\r\nsoon as Schofield saw this movement of Hood's, he sent his trains to the\r\nrear, but did not fall back himself until the 21st, and then only to\r\nColumbia.  At Columbia there was a slight skirmish but no battle.  From\r\nthis place Schofield then retreated to Franklin.  He had sent his wagons\r\nin advance, and Stanley had gone with them with two divisions to protect\r\nthem.  Cheatham's corps of Hood's army pursued the wagon train and went\r\ninto camp at Spring Hill, for the night of the 29th.\r\n\r\nSchofield retreating from Columbia on the 29th, passed Spring Hill,\r\nwhere Cheatham was bivouacked, during the night without molestation,\r\nthough within half a mile of where the Confederates were encamped.  On\r\nthe morning of the 30th he had arrived at Franklin.\r\n\r\nHood followed closely and reached Franklin in time to make an attack the\r\nsame day.  The fight was very desperate and sanguinary.  The Confederate\r\ngenerals led their men in the repeated charges, and the loss among them\r\nwas of unusual proportions.  This fighting continued with great severity\r\nuntil long after the night closed in, when the Confederates drew off.\r\nGeneral Stanley, who commanded two divisions of the Union troops, and\r\nwhose troops bore the brunt of the battle, was wounded in the fight, but\r\nmaintained his position.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's loss at Franklin, according to Thomas's report, was 1,750\r\nburied upon the field by our troops, 3,800 in the hospital, and 702\r\nprisoners besides.  Schofield's loss, as officially reported, was 189\r\nkilled, 1,033 wounded, and 1,104 captured and missing.\r\n\r\nThomas made no effort to reinforce Schofield at Franklin, as it seemed\r\nto me at the time he should have done, and fight out the battle there.\r\nHe simply ordered Schofield to continue his retreat to Nashville, which\r\nthe latter did during that night and the next day.\r\n\r\nThomas, in the meantime, was making his preparations to receive Hood.\r\nThe road to Chattanooga was still well guarded with strong garrisons at\r\nMurfreesboro, Stevenson, Bridgeport and Chattanooga.  Thomas had\r\npreviously given up Decatur and had been reinforced by A. J. Smith's two\r\ndivisions just returned from Missouri.  He also had Steedman's division\r\nand R. S. Granger's, which he had drawn from the front.  His\r\nquartermaster's men, about ten thousand in number, had been organized\r\nand armed under the command of the chief quartermaster, General J. L.\r\nDonaldson, and placed in the fortifications under the general\r\nsupervision of General Z. B. Tower, of the United States Engineers.\r\n\r\nHood was allowed to move upon Nashville, and to invest that place almost\r\nwithout interference.  Thomas was strongly fortified in his position, so\r\nthat he would have been safe against the attack of Hood.  He had troops\r\nenough even to annihilate him in the open field.  To me his delay was\r\nunaccountable--sitting there and permitting himself to be invested, so\r\nthat, in the end, to raise the siege he would have to fight the enemy\r\nstrongly posted behind fortifications.  It is true the weather was very\r\nbad.  The rain was falling and freezing as it fell, so that the ground\r\nwas covered with a sheet of ice, that made it very difficult to move.\r\nBut I was afraid that the enemy would find means of moving, elude Thomas\r\nand manage to get north of the Cumberland River.  If he did this, I\r\napprehended most serious results from the campaign in the North, and was\r\nafraid we might even have to send troops from the East to head him off\r\nif he got there, General Thomas's movements being always so deliberate\r\nand so slow, though effective in defence.\r\n\r\nI consequently urged Thomas in frequent dispatches sent from City\r\nPoint(*41) to make the attack at once.  The country was alarmed, the\r\nadministration was alarmed, and I was alarmed lest the very thing would\r\ntake place which I have just described that is, Hood would get north.\r\nIt was all without avail further than to elicit dispatches from Thomas\r\nsaying that he was getting ready to move as soon as he could, that he\r\nwas making preparations, etc.  At last I had to say to General Thomas\r\nthat I should be obliged to remove him unless he acted promptly.  He\r\nreplied that he was very sorry, but he would move as soon as he could.\r\n\r\nGeneral Logan happening to visit City Point about that time, and knowing\r\nhim as a prompt, gallant and efficient officer, I gave him an order to\r\nproceed to Nashville to relieve Thomas.  I directed him, however, not to\r\ndeliver the order or publish it until he reached there, and if Thomas\r\nhad moved, then not to deliver it at all, but communicate with me by\r\ntelegraph.  After Logan started, in thinking over the situation, I\r\nbecame restless, and concluded to go myself.  I went as far as\r\nWashington City, when a dispatch was received from General Thomas\r\nannouncing his readiness at last to move, and designating the time of\r\nhis movement.  I concluded to wait until that time. He did move, and was\r\nsuccessful from the start.  This was on the 15th of December.  General\r\nLogan was at Louisville at the time this movement was made, and\r\ntelegraphed the fact to Washington, and proceeded no farther himself.\r\n\r\nThe battle during the 15th was severe, but favorable to the Union\r\ntroops, and continued until night closed in upon the combat.  The next\r\nday the battle was renewed.  After a successful assault upon Hood's men\r\nin their intrenchments the enemy fled in disorder, routed and broken,\r\nleaving their dead, their artillery and small arms in great numbers on\r\nthe field, besides the wounded that were captured.  Our cavalry had\r\nfought on foot as infantry, and had not their horses with them; so that\r\nthey were not ready to join in the pursuit the moment the enemy\r\nretreated.  They sent back, however, for their horses, and endeavored to\r\nget to Franklin ahead of Hood's broken army by the Granny White Road,\r\nbut too much time was consumed in getting started.  They had got but a\r\nfew miles beyond the scene of the battle when they found the enemy's\r\ncavalry dismounted and behind intrenchments covering the road on which\r\nthey were advancing. Here another battle ensued, our men dismounting and\r\nfighting on foot, in which the Confederates were again routed and driven\r\nin great disorder.  Our cavalry then went into bivouac, and renewed the\r\npursuit on the following morning.  They were too late.  The enemy\r\nalready had possession of Franklin, and was beyond them. It now became a\r\nchase in which the Confederates had the lead.\r\n\r\nOur troops continued the pursuit to within a few miles of Columbia,\r\nwhere they found the rebels had destroyed the railroad bridge as well as\r\nall other bridges over Duck River.  The heavy rains of a few days before\r\nhad swelled the stream into a mad torrent, impassable except on bridges.\r\nUnfortunately, either through a mistake in the wording of the order or\r\notherwise, the pontoon bridge which was to have been sent by rail out to\r\nFranklin, to be taken thence with the pursuing column, had gone toward\r\nChattanooga.  There was, consequently, a delay of some four days in\r\nbuilding bridges out of the remains of the old railroad bridge.  Of\r\ncourse Hood got such a start in this time that farther pursuit was\r\nuseless, although it was continued for some distance, but without coming\r\nupon him again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION AGAINST FORT FISHER--ATTACK ON THE FORT--FAILURE OF THE\r\nEXPEDITION--SECOND EXPEDITION AGAINST THE FORT--CAPTURE OF FORT FISHER.\r\n\r\nUp to January, 1865, the enemy occupied Fort Fisher, at the mouth of\r\nCape Fear River and below the City of Wilmington.  This port was of\r\nimmense importance to the Confederates, because it formed their\r\nprincipal inlet for blockade runners by means of which they brought in\r\nfrom abroad such supplies and munitions of war as they could not produce\r\nat home.  It was equally important to us to get possession of it, not\r\nonly because it was desirable to cut off their supplies so as to insure\r\na speedy termination of the war, but also because foreign governments,\r\nparticularly the British Government, were constantly threatening that\r\nunless ours could maintain the blockade of that coast they should cease\r\nto recognize any blockade.  For these reasons I determined, with the\r\nconcurrence of the Navy Department, in December, to send an expedition\r\nagainst Fort Fisher for the purpose of capturing it.\r\n\r\nTo show the difficulty experienced in maintaining the blockade, I will\r\nmention a circumstance that took place at Fort Fisher after its fall.\r\nTwo English blockade runners came in at night.  Their commanders, not\r\nsupposing the fort had fallen, worked their way through all our fleet\r\nand got into the river unobserved.  They then signalled the fort,\r\nannouncing their arrival.  There was a colored man in the fort who had\r\nbeen there before and who understood these signals.  He informed General\r\nTerry what reply he should make to have them come in, and Terry did as\r\nhe advised.  The vessels came in, their officers entirely unconscious\r\nthat they were falling into the hands of the Union forces.  Even after\r\nthey were brought in to the fort they were entertained in conversation\r\nfor some little time before suspecting that the Union troops were\r\noccupying the fort.  They were finally informed that their vessels and\r\ncargoes were prizes.\r\n\r\nI selected General Weitzel, of the Army of the James, to go with the\r\nexpedition, but gave instructions through General Butler.  He commanded\r\nthe department within whose geographical limits Fort Fisher was\r\nsituated, as well as Beaufort and other points on that coast held by our\r\ntroops; he was, therefore, entitled to the right of fitting out the\r\nexpedition against Fort Fisher.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler conceived the idea that if a steamer loaded heavily with\r\npowder could be run up to near the shore under the fort and exploded, it\r\nwould create great havoc and make the capture an easy matter.  Admiral\r\nPorter, who was to command the naval squadron, seemed to fall in with\r\nthe idea, and it was not disapproved of in Washington; the navy was\r\ntherefore given the task of preparing the steamer for this purpose.  I\r\nhad no confidence in the success of the scheme, and so expressed myself;\r\nbut as no serious harm could come of the experiment, and the authorities\r\nat Washington seemed desirous to have it tried, I permitted it.  The\r\nsteamer was sent to Beaufort, North Carolina, and was there loaded with\r\npowder and prepared for the part she was to play in the reduction of\r\nFort Fisher.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler chose to go in command of the expedition himself, and was\r\nall ready to sail by the 9th of December (1864).  Very heavy storms\r\nprevailed, however, at that time along that part of the sea-coast, and\r\nprevented him from getting off until the 13th or 14th.  His advance\r\narrived off Fort Fisher on the 15th.  The naval force had been already\r\nassembled, or was assembling, but they were obliged to run into Beaufort\r\nfor munitions, coal, etc.; then, too, the powder-boat was not yet fully\r\nprepared. The fleet was ready to proceed on the 18th; but Butler, who\r\nhad remained outside from the 15th up to that time, now found himself\r\nout of coal, fresh water, etc., and had to put into Beaufort to\r\nreplenish.  Another storm overtook him, and several days more were lost\r\nbefore the army and navy were both ready at the same time to co-operate.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 23d the powder-boat was towed in by a gunboat as\r\nnear to the fort as it was safe to run.  She was then propelled by her\r\nown machinery to within about five hundred yards of the shore.  There\r\nthe clockwork, which was to explode her within a certain length of time,\r\nwas set and she was abandoned.  Everybody left, and even the vessels put\r\nout to sea to prevent the effect of the explosion upon them.  At two\r\no'clock in the morning the explosion took place--and produced no more\r\neffect on the fort, or anything else on land, than the bursting of a\r\nboiler anywhere on the Atlantic Ocean would have done.  Indeed when the\r\ntroops in Fort Fisher heard the explosion they supposed it was the\r\nbursting of a boiler in one of the Yankee gunboats.\r\n\r\nFort Fisher was situated upon a low, flat peninsula north of Cape Fear\r\nRiver.  The soil is sandy.  Back a little the peninsula is very heavily\r\nwooded, and covered with fresh-water swamps.  The fort ran across this\r\npeninsula, about five hundred yards in width, and extended along the sea\r\ncoast about thirteen hundred yards.  The fort had an armament of 21 guns\r\nand 3 mortars on the land side, and 24 guns on the sea front.  At that\r\ntime it was only garrisoned by four companies of infantry, one light\r\nbattery and the gunners at the heavy guns less than seven hundred men\r\nwith a reserve of less than a thousand men five miles up the peninsula.\r\nGeneral Whiting of the Confederate army was in command, and General\r\nBragg was in command of the force at Wilmington.  Both commenced calling\r\nfor reinforcements the moment they saw our troops landing.  The Governor\r\nof North Carolina called for everybody who could stand behind a parapet\r\nand shoot a gun, to join them.  In this way they got two or three\r\nhundred additional men into Fort Fisher; and Hoke's division, five or\r\nsix thousand strong, was sent down from Richmond.  A few of these troops\r\narrived the very day that Butler was ready to advance.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th the fleet formed for an attack in arcs of concentric\r\ncircles, their heavy iron-clads going in very close range, being nearest\r\nthe shore, and leaving intervals or spaces so that the outer vessels\r\ncould fire between them.  Porter was thus enabled to throw one hundred\r\nand fifteen shells per minute.  The damage done to the fort by these\r\nshells was very slight, only two or three cannon being disabled in the\r\nfort.  But the firing silenced all the guns by making it too hot for the\r\nmen to maintain their positions about them and compelling them to seek\r\nshelter in the bomb-proofs.\r\n\r\nOn the next day part of Butler's troops under General Adelbert Ames\r\neffected a landing out of range of the fort without difficulty.  This\r\nwas accomplished under the protection of gunboats sent for the purpose,\r\nand under cover of a renewed attack upon the fort by the fleet.  They\r\nformed a line across the peninsula and advanced, part going north and\r\npart toward the fort, covering themselves as they did so.  Curtis pushed\r\nforward and came near to Fort Fisher, capturing the small garrison at\r\nwhat was called the Flag Pond Battery.  Weitzel accompanied him to\r\nwithin a half a mile of the works.  Here he saw that the fort had not\r\nbeen injured, and so reported to Butler, advising against an assault.\r\nAmes, who had gone north in his advance, captured 228 of the reserves.\r\nThese prisoners reported to Butler that sixteen hundred of Hoke's\r\ndivision of six thousand from Richmond had already arrived and the rest\r\nwould soon be in his rear.\r\n\r\nUpon these reports Butler determined to withdraw his troops from the\r\npeninsula and return to the fleet.  At that time there had not been a\r\nman on our side injured except by one of the shells from the fleet.\r\nCurtis had got within a few yards of the works.  Some of his men had\r\nsnatched a flag from the parapet of the fort, and others had taken a\r\nhorse from the inside of the stockade.  At night Butler informed Porter\r\nof his withdrawal, giving the reasons above stated, and announced his\r\npurpose as soon as his men could embark to start for Hampton Roads.\r\nPorter represented to him that he had sent to Beaufort for more\r\nammunition.  He could fire much faster than he had been doing, and would\r\nkeep the enemy from showing himself until our men were within twenty\r\nyards of the fort, and he begged that Butler would leave some brave\r\nfellows like those who had snatched the flag from the parapet and taken\r\nthe horse from the fort.\r\n\r\nButler was unchangeable.  He got all his troops aboard, except Curtis's\r\nbrigade, and started back.  In doing this, Butler made a fearful\r\nmistake.  My instructions to him, or to the officer who went in command\r\nof the expedition, were explicit in the statement that to effect a\r\nlanding would be of itself a great victory, and if one should be\r\neffected, the foothold must not be relinquished; on the contrary, a\r\nregular siege of the fort must be commenced and, to guard against\r\ninterference by reason of storms, supplies of provisions must be laid in\r\nas soon as they could be got on shore.  But General Butler seems to have\r\nlost sight of this part of his instructions, and was back at Fort Monroe\r\non the 28th.\r\n\r\nI telegraphed to the President as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., Dec. 28, 1864.--8.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nThe Wilmington expedition has proven a gross and culpable failure.  Many\r\nof the troops are back here.  Delays and free talk of the object of the\r\nexpedition enabled the enemy to move troops to Wilmington to defeat it.\r\nAfter the expedition sailed from Fort Monroe, three days of fine weather\r\nwere squandered, during which the enemy was without a force to protect\r\nhimself. Who is to blame will, I hope, be known.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nPorter sent dispatches to the Navy Department in which he complained\r\nbitterly of having been abandoned by the army just when the fort was\r\nnearly in our possession, and begged that our troops might be sent back\r\nagain to cooperate, but with a different commander.  As soon as I heard\r\nthis I sent a messenger to Porter with a letter asking him to hold on.\r\nI assured him that I fully sympathized with him in his disappointment,\r\nand that I would send the same troops back with a different commander,\r\nwith some reinforcements to offset those which the enemy had received.\r\nI told him it would take some little time to get transportation for the\r\nadditional troops; but as soon as it could be had the men should be on\r\ntheir way to him, and there would be no delay on my part.  I selected A.\r\nH. Terry to command.\r\n\r\nIt was the 6th of January before the transports could be got ready and\r\nthe troops aboard.  They sailed from Fortress Monroe on that day.  The\r\nobject and destination of the second expedition were at the time kept a\r\nsecret to all except a few in the Navy Department and in the army to\r\nwhom it was necessary to impart the information.  General Terry had not\r\nthe slightest idea of where he was going or what he was to do.  He\r\nsimply knew that he was going to sea and that he had his orders with\r\nhim, which were to be opened when out at sea.\r\n\r\nHe was instructed to communicate freely with Porter and have entire\r\nharmony between army and navy, because the work before them would\r\nrequire the best efforts of both arms of service. They arrived off\r\nBeaufort on the 8th. A heavy storm, however, prevented a landing at\r\nFort Fisher until the 13th.  The navy prepared itself for attack about\r\nas before, and the same time assisted the army in landing, this time\r\nfive miles away.  Only iron-clads fired at first; the object being to\r\ndraw the fire of the enemy's guns so as to ascertain their positions.\r\nThis object being accomplished, they then let in their shots thick and\r\nfast.  Very soon the guns were all silenced, and the fort showed evident\r\nsigns of being much injured.\r\n\r\nTerry deployed his men across the peninsula as had been done before, and\r\nat two o'clock on the following morning was up within two miles of the\r\nfort with a respectable _abatis_ in front of his line. His artillery was\r\nall landed on that day, the 14th.  Again Curtis's brigade of Ame's\r\ndivision had the lead. By noon they had carried an unfinished work less\r\nthan a half mile from the fort, and turned it so as to face the other\r\nway.\r\n\r\nTerry now saw Porter and arranged for an assault on the following day.\r\nThe two commanders arranged their signals so that they could communicate\r\nwith each other from time to time as they might have occasion.  At day\r\nlight the fleet commenced its firing.  The time agreed upon for the\r\nassault was the middle of the afternoon, and Ames who commanded the\r\nassaulting column moved at 3.30.  Porter landed a force of sailors and\r\nmarines to move against the sea-front in co-operation with Ames's\r\nassault.  They were under Commander Breese of the navy.  These sailors\r\nand marines had worked their way up to within a couple of hundred yards\r\nof the fort before the assault.  The signal was given and the assault\r\nwas made; but the poor sailors and marines were repulsed and very badly\r\nhandled by the enemy, losing 280 killed and wounded out of their number.\r\n\r\nCurtis's brigade charged successfully though met by a heavy fire, some\r\nof the men having to wade through the swamp up to their waists to reach\r\nthe fort.  Many were wounded, of course, and some killed; but they soon\r\nreached the palisades.  These they cut away, and pushed on through.  The\r\nother troops then came up, Pennypacker's following Curtis, and Bell, who\r\ncommanded the 3d brigade of Ames's division, following Pennypacker.  But\r\nthe fort was not yet captured though the parapet was gained.\r\n\r\nThe works were very extensive.  The large parapet around the work would\r\nhave been but very little protection to those inside except when they\r\nwere close up under it.  Traverses had, therefore, been run until really\r\nthe work was a succession of small forts enclosed by a large one.  The\r\nrebels made a desperate effort to hold the fort, and had to be driven\r\nfrom these traverses one by one.  The fight continued till long after\r\nnight.  Our troops gained first one traverse and then another, and by 10\r\no'clock at night the place was carried.  During this engagement the\r\nsailors, who had been repulsed in their assault on the bastion, rendered\r\nthe best service they could by reinforcing Terry's northern line--thus\r\nenabling him to send a detachment to the assistance of Ames.  The fleet\r\nkept up a continuous fire upon that part of the fort which was still\r\noccupied by the enemy.  By means of signals they could be informed where\r\nto direct their shots.\r\n\r\nDuring the succeeding nights the enemy blew up Fort Caswell on the\r\nopposite side of Cape Fear River, and abandoned two extensive works on\r\nSmith's Island in the river.\r\n\r\nOur captures in all amounted to 169 guns, besides small-arms, with full\r\nsupplies of ammunition, and 2,083 prisoners.  In addition to these,\r\nthere were about 700 dead and wounded left there.  We had lost 110\r\nkilled and 536 wounded.\r\n\r\nIn this assault on Fort Fisher, Bell, one of the brigade commanders, was\r\nkilled, and two, Curtis and Pennypacker, were badly wounded.\r\n\r\nSecretary Stanton, who was on his way back from Savannah, arrived off\r\nFort Fisher soon after it fell.  When he heard the good news he promoted\r\nall the officers of any considerable rank for their conspicuous\r\ngallantry.  Terry had been nominated for major-general, but had not been\r\nconfirmed.  This confirmed him; and soon after I recommended him for a\r\nbrigadier-generalcy in the regular army, and it was given to him for\r\nthis victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nSHERMAN'S MARCH NORTH--SHERIDAN ORDERED TO LYNCHBURG--CANBY ORDERED TO\r\nMOVE AGAINST MOBILE--MOVEMENTS OF SCHOFIELD AND THOMAS--CAPTURE OF\r\nCOLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA--SHERMAN IN THE CAROLINAS.\r\n\r\nWhen news of Sherman being in possession of Savannah reached the North,\r\ndistinguished statesmen and visitors began to pour in to see him.  Among\r\nothers who went was the Secretary of War, who seemed much pleased at the\r\nresult of his campaign.  Mr. Draper, the collector of customs of New\r\nYork, who was with Mr. Stanton's party, was put in charge of the public\r\nproperty that had been abandoned and captured.  Savannah was then turned\r\nover to General Foster's command to hold, so that Sherman might have his\r\nown entire army free to operate as might be decided upon in the future.\r\nI sent the chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac (General Barnard)\r\nwith letters to General Sherman.  He remained some time with the\r\ngeneral, and when he returned brought back letters, one of which\r\ncontained suggestions from Sherman as to what ought to be done in\r\nco-operation with him, when he should have started upon his march\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nI must not neglect to state here the fact that I had no idea originally\r\nof having Sherman march from Savannah to Richmond, or even to North\r\nCarolina.  The season was bad, the roads impassable for anything except\r\nsuch an army as he had, and I should not have thought of ordering such a\r\nmove.  I had, therefore, made preparations to collect transports to\r\ncarry Sherman and his army around to the James River by water, and so\r\ninformed him.  On receiving this letter he went to work immediately to\r\nprepare for the move, but seeing that it would require a long time to\r\ncollect the transports, he suggested the idea then of marching up north\r\nthrough the Carolinas.  I was only too happy to approve this; for if\r\nsuccessful, it promised every advantage.  His march through Georgia had\r\nthoroughly destroyed all lines of transportation in that State, and had\r\ncompletely cut the enemy off from all sources of supply to the west of\r\nit.  If North and South Carolina were rendered helpless so far as\r\ncapacity for feeding Lee's army was concerned, the Confederate garrison\r\nat Richmond would be reduced in territory, from which to draw supplies,\r\nto very narrow limits in the State of Virginia; and, although that\r\nsection of the country was fertile, it was already well exhausted of\r\nboth forage and food.  I approved Sherman's suggestion therefore at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nThe work of preparation was tedious, because supplies, to load the\r\nwagons for the march, had to be brought from a long distance.  Sherman\r\nwould now have to march through a country furnishing fewer provisions\r\nthan that he had previously been operating in during his march to the\r\nsea.  Besides, he was confronting, or marching toward, a force of the\r\nenemy vastly superior to any his troops had encountered on their\r\nprevious march; and the territory through which he had to pass had now\r\nbecome of such vast importance to the very existence of the Confederate\r\narmy, that the most desperate efforts were to be expected in order to\r\nsave it.\r\n\r\nSherman, therefore, while collecting the necessary supplies to start\r\nwith, made arrangements with Admiral Dahlgren, who commanded that part\r\nof the navy on the South Carolina and Georgia coast, and General Foster,\r\ncommanding the troops, to take positions, and hold a few points on the\r\nsea coast, which he (Sherman) designated, in the neighborhood of\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\nThis provision was made to enable him to fall back upon the sea coast,\r\nin case he should encounter a force sufficient to stop his onward\r\nprogress.  He also wrote me a letter, making suggestions as to what he\r\nwould like to have done in support of his movement farther north.  This\r\nletter was brought to City Point by General Barnard at a time when I\r\nhappened to be going to Washington City, where I arrived on the 21st of\r\nJanuary.  I cannot tell the provision I had already made to co-operate\r\nwith Sherman, in anticipation of his expected movement, better than by\r\ngiving my reply to this letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 21,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN, Commanding Mill Div. of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--Your letters brought by General Barnard were received at City\r\nPoint, and read with interest.  Not having them with me, however, I\r\ncannot say that in this I will be able to satisfy you on all points of\r\nrecommendation.  As I arrived here at one P.M., and must leave at six\r\nP.M., having in the meantime spent over three hours with the Secretary\r\nand General Halleck, I must be brief.  Before your last request to have\r\nThomas make a campaign into the heart of Alabama, I had ordered\r\nSchofield to Annapolis, Md., with his corps.  The advance (six thousand)\r\nwill reach the seaboard by the 23d, the remainder following as rapidly\r\nas railroad transportation can be procured from Cincinnati.  The corps\r\nnumbers over twenty-one thousand men.  I was induced to do this because\r\nI did not believe Thomas could possibly be got off before spring.  His\r\npursuit of Hood indicated a sluggishness that satisfied me that he would\r\nnever do to conduct one of your campaigns.  The command of the advance\r\nof the pursuit was left to subordinates, whilst Thomas followed far\r\nbehind.  When Hood had crossed the Tennessee, and those in pursuit had\r\nreached it, Thomas had not much more than half crossed the State, from\r\nwhence he returned to Nashville to take steamer for Eastport. He is\r\npossessed of excellent judgment, great coolness and honesty, but he is\r\nnot good on a pursuit.  He also reported his troops fagged, and that it\r\nwas necessary to equip up.  This report and a determination to give the\r\nenemy no rest determined me to use his surplus troops elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThomas is still left with a sufficient force surplus to go to Selma\r\nunder an energetic leader.  He has been telegraphed to, to know whether\r\nhe could go, and, if so, which of the several routes he would select.\r\nNo reply is yet received.  Canby has been ordered to act offensively\r\nfrom the sea-coast to the interior, towards Montgomery and Selma.\r\nThomas's forces will move from the north at an early day, or some of his\r\ntroops will be sent to Canby.  Without further reinforcements Canby will\r\nhave a moving column of twenty thousand men.\r\n\r\nFort Fisher, you are aware, has been captured.  We have a force there of\r\neight thousand effective.  At New Bern about half the number.  It is\r\nrumored, through deserters, that Wilmington also has fallen.  I am\r\ninclined to believe the rumor, because on the 17th we knew the enemy\r\nwere blowing up their works about Fort Caswell, and that on the 18th\r\nTerry moved on Wilmington.\r\n\r\nIf Wilmington is captured, Schofield will go there.  If not, he will be\r\nsent to New Bern.  In either event, all the surplus forces at the two\r\npoints will move to the interior toward Goldsboro' in co-operation with\r\nyour movements.  From either point, railroad communications can be run\r\nout, there being here abundance of rolling-stock suited to the gauge of\r\nthose roads.\r\n\r\nThere have been about sixteen thousand men sent from Lee's army south.\r\nOf these, you will have fourteen thousand against you, if Wilmington is\r\nnot held by the enemy, casualties at Fort Fisher having overtaken about\r\ntwo thousand.\r\n\r\nAll these troops are subject to your orders as you come in communication\r\nwith them.  They will be so instructed.  From about Richmond I will\r\nwatch Lee closely, and if he detaches much more, or attempts to\r\nevacuate, will pitch in.  In the meantime, should you be brought to a\r\nhalt anywhere, I can send two corps of thirty thousand effective men to\r\nyour support, from the troops about Richmond.\r\n\r\nTo resume:  Canby is ordered to operate to the interior from the Gulf.\r\nA. J. Smith may go from the north, but I think it doubtful.  A force of\r\ntwenty-eight or thirty thousand will co-operate with you from New Bern\r\nor Wilmington, or both.  You can call for reinforcements.\r\n\r\nThis will be handed you by Captain Hudson, of my staff, who will return\r\nwith any message you may have for me.  If there is anything I can do for\r\nyou in the way of having supplies on ship-board, at any point on the\r\nsea-coast, ready for you, let me know it.\r\n\r\nYours truly, U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had written on the 18th of January to General Sherman, giving him the\r\nnews of the battle of Nashville.  He was much pleased at the result,\r\nalthough, like myself, he had been very much disappointed at Thomas for\r\npermitting Hood to cross the Tennessee River and nearly the whole State\r\nof Tennessee, and come to Nashville to be attacked there.  He, however,\r\nas I had done, sent Thomas a warm congratulatory letter.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of January, 1865, the resolutions of thanks to Sherman and\r\nhis army passed by Congress were approved.\r\n\r\nSherman, after the capture, at once had the debris cleared up,\r\ncommencing the work by removing the piling and torpedoes from the river,\r\nand taking up all obstructions.  He had then intrenched the city, so\r\nthat it could be held by a small garrison.  By the middle of January all\r\nhis work was done, except the accumulation of supplies to commence his\r\nmovement with.\r\n\r\nHe proposed to move in two columns, one from Savannah, going along by\r\nthe river of the same name, and the other by roads farther east,\r\nthreatening Charleston.  He commenced the advance by moving his right\r\nwing to Beaufort, South Carolina, then to Pocotaligo by water.  This\r\ncolumn, in moving north, threatened Charleston, and, indeed, it was not\r\ndetermined at first that they would have a force visit Charleston.\r\nSouth Carolina had done so much to prepare the public mind of the South\r\nfor secession, and had been so active in precipitating the decision of\r\nthe question before the South was fully prepared to meet it, that there\r\nwas, at that time, a feeling throughout the North and also largely\r\nentertained by people of the South, that the State of South Carolina,\r\nand Charleston, the hot-bed of secession in particular, ought to have a\r\nheavy hand laid upon them.  In fact, nothing but the decisive results\r\nthat followed, deterred the radical portion of the people from\r\ncondemning the movement, because Charleston had been left out.  To pass\r\ninto the interior would, however, be to insure the evacuation of the\r\ncity, and its possession by the navy and Foster's troops.  It is so\r\nsituated between two formidable rivers that a small garrison could have\r\nheld it against all odds as long as their supplies would hold out.\r\nSherman therefore passed it by.\r\n\r\nBy the first of February all preparations were completed for the final\r\nmarch, Columbia, South Carolina, being the first objective;\r\nFayetteville, North Carolina, the second; and Goldsboro, or\r\nneighborhood, the final one, unless something further should be\r\ndetermined upon.  The right wing went from Pocotaligo, and the left from\r\nabout Hardeeville on the Savannah River, both columns taking a pretty\r\ndirect route for Columbia.  The cavalry, however, were to threaten\r\nCharleston on the right, and Augusta on the left.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of January Fort Fisher had fallen, news of which Sherman had\r\nreceived before starting out on his march.  We already had New Bern and\r\nhad soon Wilmington, whose fall followed that of Fort Fisher; as did\r\nother points on the sea coast, where the National troops were now in\r\nreadiness to co-operate with Sherman's advance when he had passed\r\nFayetteville.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of January I ordered Canby, in command at New Orleans, to\r\nmove against Mobile, Montgomery and Selma, Alabama, for the purpose of\r\ndestroying roads, machine shops, etc.  On the 8th of February I ordered\r\nSheridan, who was in the Valley of Virginia, to push forward as soon as\r\nthe weather would permit and strike the canal west of Richmond at or\r\nabout Lynchburg; and on the 20th I made the order to go to Lynchburg as\r\nsoon as the roads would permit, saying:  \"As soon as it is possible to\r\ntravel, I think you will have no difficulty about reaching Lynchburg\r\nwith a cavalry force alone.  From there you could destroy the railroad\r\nand canal in every direction, so as to be of no further use to the\r\nrebellion. * * * This additional raid, with one starting from East\r\nTennessee under Stoneman, numbering about four or five thousand cavalry;\r\none from Eastport, Mississippi, ten thousand cavalry; Canby, from Mobile\r\nBay, with about eighteen thousand mixed troops--these three latter\r\npushing for Tuscaloosa, Selma and Montgomery; and Sherman with a large\r\narmy eating out the vitals of South Carolina--is all that will be wanted\r\nto leave nothing for the rebellion to stand upon.  I would advise you to\r\novercome great obstacles to accomplish this.  Charleston was evacuated\r\non Tuesday last.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of February, more than a month after Canby had received his\r\norders, I again wrote to him, saying that I was extremely anxious to\r\nhear of his being in Alabama.  I notified him, also, that I had sent\r\nGrierson to take command of his cavalry, he being a very efficient\r\nofficer.  I further suggested that Forrest was probably in Mississippi,\r\nand if he was there, he would find him an officer of great courage and\r\ncapacity whom it would be difficult to get by.  I still further informed\r\nhim that Thomas had been ordered to start a cavalry force into\r\nMississippi on the 20th of February, or as soon as possible thereafter.\r\nThis force did not get off however.\r\n\r\nAll these movements were designed to be in support of Sherman's march,\r\nthe object being to keep the Confederate troops in the West from leaving\r\nthere.  But neither Canby nor Thomas could be got off in time.  I had\r\nsome time before depleted Thomas's army to reinforce Canby, for the\r\nreason that Thomas had failed to start an expedition which he had been\r\nordered to send out, and to have the troops where they might do\r\nsomething.  Canby seemed to be equally deliberate in all of his\r\nmovements.  I ordered him to go in person; but he prepared to send a\r\ndetachment under another officer.  General Granger had got down to New\r\nOrleans, in some way or other, and I wrote Canby that he must not put\r\nhim in command of troops.  In spite of this he asked the War Department\r\nto assign Granger to the command of a corps.\r\n\r\nAlmost in despair of having adequate service rendered to the cause in\r\nthat quarter, I said to Canby:  \"I am in receipt of a dispatch * * *\r\ninforming me that you have made requisitions for a construction corps\r\nand material to build seventy miles of railroad.  I have directed that\r\nnone be sent.  Thomas's army has been depleted to send a force to you\r\nthat they might be where they could act in winter, and at least detain\r\nthe force the enemy had in the West.  If there had been any idea of\r\nrepairing railroads, it could have been done much better from the North,\r\nwhere we already had the troops.  I expected your movements to be\r\nco-operative with Sherman's last.  This has now entirely failed.  I\r\nwrote to you long ago, urging you to push promptly and to live upon the\r\ncountry, and destroy railroads, machine shops, etc., not to build them.\r\nTake Mobile and hold it, and push your forces to the interior--to\r\nMontgomery and to Selma. Destroy railroads, rolling stock, and\r\neverything useful for carrying on war, and, when you have done this,\r\ntake such positions as can be supplied by water.  By this means alone\r\nyou can occupy positions from which the enemy's roads in the interior\r\ncan be kept broken.\"\r\n\r\nMost of these expeditions got off finally, but too late to render any\r\nservice in the direction for which they were designed.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, ready to intercept his advance, consisted of Hardee's troops\r\nand Wheeler's cavalry, perhaps less than fifteen thousand men in all;\r\nbut frantic efforts were being made in Richmond, as I was sure would be\r\nthe case, to retard Sherman's movements. Everything possible was being\r\ndone to raise troops in the South.  Lee dispatched against Sherman the\r\ntroops which had been sent to relieve Fort Fisher, which, including\r\nthose of the other defences of the harbor and its neighborhood,\r\namounted, after deducting the two thousand killed, wounded and captured,\r\nto fourteen thousand men.  After Thomas's victory at Nashville what\r\nremained, of Hood's army were gathered together and forwarded as rapidly\r\nas possible to the east to co-operate with these forces; and, finally,\r\nGeneral Joseph E. Johnston, one of the ablest commanders of the South\r\nthough not in favor with the administration (or at least with Mr.\r\nDavis), was put in command of all the troops in North and South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nSchofield arrived at Annapolis in the latter part of January, but before\r\nsending his troops to North Carolina I went with him down the coast to\r\nsee the situation of affairs, as I could give fuller directions after\r\nbeing on the ground than I could very well have given without.  We soon\r\nreturned, and the troops were sent by sea to Cape Fear River.  Both New\r\nBern and Wilmington are connected with Raleigh by railroads which unite\r\nat Goldsboro.  Schofield was to land troops at Smithville, near the\r\nmouth of the Cape Fear River on the west side, and move up to secure the\r\nWilmington and Charlotteville Railroad.  This column took their pontoon\r\nbridges with them, to enable them to cross over to the island south of\r\nthe city of Wilmington.  A large body was sent by the north side to\r\nco-operate with them.  They succeeded in taking the city on the 22d of\r\nFebruary.  I took the precaution to provide for Sherman's army, in case\r\nhe should be forced to turn in toward the sea coast before reaching\r\nNorth Carolina, by forwarding supplies to every place where he was\r\nliable to have to make such a deflection from his projected march.  I\r\nalso sent railroad rolling stock, of which we had a great abundance, now\r\nthat we were not operating the roads in Virginia.  The gauge of the\r\nNorth Carolina railroads being the same as the Virginia railroads had\r\nbeen altered too; these cars and locomotives were ready for use there\r\nwithout any change.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of January I countermanded the orders given to Thomas to\r\nmove south to Alabama and Georgia.  (I had previously reduced his force\r\nby sending a portion of it to Terry.)  I directed in lieu of this\r\nmovement, that he should send Stoneman through East Tennessee, and push\r\nhim well down toward Columbia, South Carolina, in support of Sherman.\r\nThomas did not get Stoneman off in time, but, on the contrary, when I\r\nhad supposed he was on his march in support of Sherman I heard of his\r\nbeing in Louisville, Kentucky.  I immediately changed the order, and\r\ndirected Thomas to send him toward Lynchburg.  Finally, however, on the\r\n12th of March, he did push down through the north-western end of South\r\nCarolina, creating some consternation.  I also ordered Thomas to send\r\nthe 4th corps (Stanley's) to Bull Gap and to destroy no more roads east\r\nof that.  I also directed him to concentrate supplies at Knoxville, with\r\na view to a probable movement of his army through that way toward\r\nLynchburg.\r\n\r\nGoldsboro is four hundred and twenty-five miles from Savannah. Sherman's\r\nmarch was without much incident until he entered Columbia, on the 17th\r\nof February.  He was detained in his progress by having to repair and\r\ncorduroy the roads, and rebuild the bridges.  There was constant\r\nskirmishing and fighting between the cavalry of the two armies, but this\r\ndid not retard the advance of the infantry.  Four days, also, were lost\r\nin making complete the destruction of the most important railroads south\r\nof Columbia; there was also some delay caused by the high water, and the\r\ndestruction of the bridges on the line of the road.  A formidable river\r\nhad to be crossed near Columbia, and that in the face of a small\r\ngarrison under General Wade Hampton.  There was but little delay,\r\nhowever, further than that caused by high water in the stream.  Hampton\r\nleft as Sherman approached, and the city was found to be on fire.\r\n\r\nThere has since been a great deal of acrimony displayed in discussions\r\nof the question as to who set Columbia on fire. Sherman denies it on the\r\npart of his troops, and Hampton denies it on the part of the\r\nConfederates.  One thing is certain:  as soon as our troops took\r\npossession, they at once proceeded to extinguish the flames to the best\r\nof their ability with the limited means at hand.  In any case, the\r\nexample set by the Confederates in burning the village of Chambersburg,\r\nPa., a town which was not garrisoned, would seem to make a defence of\r\nthe act of firing the seat of government of the State most responsible\r\nfor the conflict then raging, not imperative.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate troops having vacated the city, the mayor took\r\npossession, and sallied forth to meet the commander of the National\r\nforces for the purpose of surrendering the town, making terms for the\r\nprotection of property, etc.  Sherman paid no attention at all to the\r\noverture, but pushed forward and took the town without making any\r\nconditions whatever with its citizens.  He then, however, co-operated\r\nwith the mayor in extinguishing the flames and providing for the people\r\nwho were rendered destitute by this destruction of their homes.  When he\r\nleft there he even gave the mayor five hundred head of cattle to be\r\ndistributed among the citizens, to tide them over until some arrangement\r\ncould be made for their future supplies.  He remained in Columbia until\r\nthe roads, public buildings, workshops and everything that could be\r\nuseful to the enemy were destroyed.  While at Columbia, Sherman learned\r\nfor the first time that what remained of Hood's army was confronting\r\nhim, under the command of General Beauregard.\r\n\r\nCharleston was evacuated on the 18th of February, and Foster garrisoned\r\nthe place.  Wilmington was captured on the 22d. Columbia and Cheraw\r\nfarther north, were regarded as so secure from invasion that the wealthy\r\npeople of Charleston and Augusta had sent much of their valuable\r\nproperty to these two points to be stored.  Among the goods sent there\r\nwere valuable carpets, tons of old Madeira, silverware, and furniture.\r\nI am afraid much of these goods fell into the hands of our troops.\r\nThere was found at Columbia a large amount of powder, some artillery,\r\nsmall-arms and fixed ammunition.  These, of course were among the\r\narticles destroyed.  While here, Sherman also learned of Johnston's\r\nrestoration to command.  The latter was given, as already stated, all\r\ntroops in North and South Carolina.  After the completion of the\r\ndestruction of public property about Columbia, Sherman proceeded on his\r\nmarch and reached Cheraw without any special opposition and without\r\nincident to relate. The railroads, of course, were thoroughly destroyed\r\non the way.  Sherman remained a day or two at Cheraw; and, finally, on\r\nthe 6th of March crossed his troops over the Pedee and advanced straight\r\nfor Fayetteville.  Hardee and Hampton were there, and barely escaped.\r\nSherman reached Fayetteville on the 11th of March.  He had dispatched\r\nscouts from Cheraw with letters to General Terry, at Wilmington, asking\r\nhim to send a steamer with some supplies of bread, clothing and other\r\narticles which he enumerated.  The scouts got through successfully, and\r\na boat was sent with the mail and such articles for which Sherman had\r\nasked as were in store at Wilmington; unfortunately, however, those\r\nstores did not contain clothing.\r\n\r\nFour days later, on the 15th, Sherman left Fayetteville for Goldsboro.\r\nThe march, now, had to be made with great caution, for he was\r\napproaching Lee's army and nearing the country that still remained open\r\nto the enemy.  Besides, he was confronting all that he had had to\r\nconfront in his previous march up to that point, reinforced by the\r\ngarrisons along the road and by what remained of Hood's army.  Frantic\r\nappeals were made to the people to come in voluntarily and swell the\r\nranks of our foe.  I presume, however, that Johnston did not have in all\r\nover 35,000 or 40,000 men.  The people had grown tired of the war, and\r\ndesertions from the Confederate army were much more numerous than the\r\nvoluntary accessions.\r\n\r\nThere was some fighting at Averysboro on the 16th between Johnston's\r\ntroops and Sherman's, with some loss; and at Bentonville on the 19th and\r\n21st of March, but Johnston withdrew from the contest before the morning\r\nof the 22d.  Sherman's loss in these last engagements in killed,\r\nwounded, and missing, was about sixteen hundred.  Sherman's troops at\r\nlast reached Goldsboro on the 23d of the month and went into bivouac;\r\nand there his men were destined to have a long rest.  Schofield was\r\nthere to meet him with the troops which had been sent to Wilmington.\r\n\r\nSherman was no longer in danger.  He had Johnston confronting him; but\r\nwith an army much inferior to his own, both in numbers and morale.  He\r\nhad Lee to the north of him with a force largely superior; but I was\r\nholding Lee with a still greater force, and had he made his escape and\r\ngotten down to reinforce Johnston, Sherman, with the reinforcements he\r\nnow had from Schofield and Terry, would have been able to hold the\r\nConfederates at bay for an indefinite period.  He was near the sea-shore\r\nwith his back to it, and our navy occupied the harbors.  He had a\r\nrailroad to both Wilmington and New Bern, and his flanks were thoroughly\r\nprotected by streams, which intersect that part of the country and\r\ndeepen as they approach the sea.  Then, too, Sherman knew that if Lee\r\nshould escape me I would be on his heels, and he and Johnson together\r\nwould be crushed in one blow if they attempted to make a stand.  With\r\nthe loss of their capital, it is doubtful whether Lee's army would have\r\namounted to much as an army when it reached North Carolina.  Johnston's\r\narmy was demoralized by constant defeat and would hardly have made an\r\noffensive movement, even if they could have been induced to remain on\r\nduty.  The men of both Lee's and Johnston's armies were, like their\r\nbrethren of the North, as brave as men can be; but no man is so brave\r\nthat he may not meet such defeats and disasters as to discourage him and\r\ndampen his ardor for any cause, no matter how just he deems it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nARRIVAL OF THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS--LINCOLN AND THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS\r\n--AN ANECDOTE OF LINCOLN--THE WINTER BEFORE PETERSBURG--SHERIDAN DESTROYS\r\nTHE RAILROAD--GORDON CARRIES THE PICKET LINE--PARKE RECAPTURES THE LINE\r\n--THE LINE OF BATTLE OF WHITE OAK ROAD.\r\n\r\nOn the last of January, 1865, peace commissioners from the so-called\r\nConfederate States presented themselves on our lines around Petersburg,\r\nand were immediately conducted to my headquarters at City Point.  They\r\nproved to be Alexander H. Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederacy,\r\nJudge Campbell, Assistant-Secretary of War, and R. M. T. Hunt, formerly\r\nUnited States Senator and then a member of the Confederate Senate.\r\n\r\nIt was about dark when they reached my headquarters, and I at once\r\nconducted them to the steam Mary Martin, a Hudson River boat which was\r\nvery comfortably fitted up for the use of passengers.  I at once\r\ncommunicated by telegraph with Washington and informed the Secretary of\r\nWar and the President of the arrival of these commissioners and that\r\ntheir object was to negotiate terms of peace between the United States\r\nand, as they termed it, the Confederate Government.  I was instructed to\r\nretain them at City Point, until the President, or some one whom he\r\nwould designate, should come to meet them.  They remained several days\r\nas guests on board the boat.  I saw them quite frequently, though I have\r\nno recollection of having had any conversation whatever with them on the\r\nsubject of their mission.  It was something I had nothing to do with,\r\nand I therefore did not wish to express any views on the subject.  For\r\nmy own part I never had admitted, and never was ready to admit, that\r\nthey were the representatives of a GOVERNMENT.  There had been too great\r\na waste of blood and treasure to concede anything of the kind.  As long\r\nas they remained there, however, our relations were pleasant and I found\r\nthem all very agreeable gentlemen.  I directed the captain to furnish\r\nthem with the best the boat afforded, and to administer to their comfort\r\nin every way possible.  No guard was placed over them and no restriction\r\nwas put upon their movements; nor was there any pledge asked that they\r\nwould not abuse the privileges extended to them.  They were permitted to\r\nleave the boat when they felt like it, and did so, coming up on the bank\r\nand visiting me at my headquarters.\r\n\r\nI had never met either of these gentlemen before the war, but knew them\r\nwell by reputation and through their public services, and I had been a\r\nparticular admirer of Mr. Stephens.  I had always supposed that he was a\r\nvery small man, but when I saw him in the dusk of the evening I was very\r\nmuch surprised to find so large a man as he seemed to be.  When he got\r\ndown on to the boat I found that he was wearing a coarse gray woollen\r\novercoat, a manufacture that had been introduced into the South during\r\nthe rebellion.  The cloth was thicker than anything of the kind I had\r\never seen, even in Canada.  The overcoat extended nearly to his feet,\r\nand was so large that it gave him the appearance of being an\r\naverage-sized man.  He took this off when he reached the cabin of the\r\nboat, and I was struck with the apparent change in size, in the coat and\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days, about the 2d of February, I received a dispatch from\r\nWashington, directing me to send the commissioners to Hampton Roads to\r\nmeet the President and a member of the cabinet.  Mr. Lincoln met them\r\nthere and had an interview of short duration.  It was not a great while\r\nafter they met that the President visited me at City Point.  He spoke of\r\nhis having met the commissioners, and said he had told them that there\r\nwould be no use in entering into any negotiations unless they would\r\nrecognize, first:  that the Union as a whole must be forever preserved,\r\nand second:  that slavery must be abolished. If they were willing to\r\nconcede these two points, then he was ready to enter into negotiations\r\nand was almost willing to hand them a blank sheet of paper with his\r\nsignature attached for them to fill in the terms upon which they were\r\nwilling to live with us in the Union and be one people.  He always\r\nshowed a generous and kindly spirit toward the Southern people, and I\r\nnever heard him abuse an enemy.  Some of the cruel things said about\r\nPresident Lincoln, particularly in the North, used to pierce him to the\r\nheart; but never in my presence did he evince a revengeful disposition\r\nand I saw a great deal of him at City Point, for he seemed glad to get\r\naway from the cares and anxieties of the capital.\r\n\r\nRight here I might relate an anecdote of Mr. Lincoln.  It was on the\r\noccasion of his visit to me just after he had talked with the peace\r\ncommissioners at Hampton Roads.  After a little conversation, he asked\r\nme if I had seen that overcoat of Stephens's.  I replied that I had.\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"did you see him take it off?\"  I said yes.  \"Well,\"\r\nsaid he, \"didn't you think it was the biggest shuck and the littlest ear\r\nthat ever you did see?\"  Long afterwards I told this story to the\r\nConfederate General J. B. Gordon, at the time a member of the Senate.\r\nHe repeated it to Stephens, and, as I heard afterwards, Stephens laughed\r\nimmoderately at the simile of Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the winter, after the departure of the peace commissioners,\r\npassed off quietly and uneventfully, except for two or three little\r\nincidents.  On one occasion during this period, while I was visiting\r\nWashington City for the purpose of conferring with the administration,\r\nthe enemy's cavalry under General Wade Hampton, passing our extreme left\r\nand then going to the south, got in east of us.  Before their presence\r\nwas known, they had driven off a large number of beef cattle that were\r\ngrazing in that section.  It was a fair capture, and they were\r\nsufficiently needed by the Confederates.  It was only retaliating for\r\nwhat we had done, sometimes for many weeks at a time, when out of\r\nsupplies taking what the Confederate army otherwise would have gotten.\r\nAs appears in this book, on one single occasion we captured five\r\nthousand head of cattle which were crossing the Mississippi River near\r\nPort Hudson on their way from Texas to supply the Confederate army in\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nOne of the most anxious periods of my experience during the rebellion\r\nwas the last few weeks before Petersburg.  I felt that the situation of\r\nthe Confederate army was such that they would try to make an escape at\r\nthe earliest practicable moment, and I was afraid, every morning, that I\r\nwould awake from my sleep to hear that Lee had gone, and that nothing\r\nwas left but a picket line.  He had his railroad by the way of Danville\r\nsouth, and I was afraid that he was running off his men and all stores\r\nand ordnance except such as it would be necessary to carry with him for\r\nhis immediate defence.  I knew he could move much more lightly and more\r\nrapidly than I, and that, if he got the start, he would leave me behind\r\nso that we would have the same army to fight again farther south and the\r\nwar might be prolonged another year.\r\n\r\nI was led to this fear by the fact that I could not see how it was\r\npossible for the Confederates to hold out much longer where they were.\r\nThere is no doubt that Richmond would have been evacuated much sooner\r\nthan it was, if it had not been that it was the capital of the so-called\r\nConfederacy, and the fact of evacuating the capital would, of course,\r\nhave had a very demoralizing effect upon the Confederate army.  When it\r\nwas evacuated (as we shall see further on), the Confederacy at once\r\nbegan to crumble and fade away.  Then, too, desertions were taking\r\nplace, not only among those who were with General Lee in the\r\nneighborhood of their capital, but throughout the whole Confederacy.  I\r\nremember that in a conversation with me on one occasion long prior to\r\nthis, General Butler remarked that the Confederates would find great\r\ndifficulty in getting more men for their army; possibly adding, though I\r\nam not certain as to this, \"unless they should arm the slave.\"\r\n\r\nThe South, as we all knew, were conscripting every able-bodied man\r\nbetween the ages of eighteen and forty-five; and now they had passed a\r\nlaw for the further conscription of boys from fourteen to eighteen,\r\ncalling them the junior reserves, and men from forty-five to sixty to be\r\ncalled the senior reserves.  The latter were to hold the necessary\r\npoints not in immediate danger, and especially those in the rear.\r\nGeneral Butler, in alluding to this conscription, remarked that they\r\nwere thus \"robbing both the cradle and the grave,\" an expression which I\r\nafterwards used in writing a letter to Mr. Washburn.\r\n\r\nIt was my belief that while the enemy could get no more recruits they\r\nwere losing at least a regiment a day, taking it throughout the entire\r\narmy, by desertions alone.  Then by casualties of war, sickness, and\r\nother natural causes, their losses were much heavier.  It was a mere\r\nquestion of arithmetic to calculate how long they could hold out while\r\nthat rate of depletion was going on.  Of course long before their army\r\nwould be thus reduced to nothing the army which we had in the field\r\nwould have been able to capture theirs.  Then too I knew from the great\r\nnumber of desertions, that the men who had fought so bravely, so\r\ngallantly and so long for the cause which they believed in--and as\r\nearnestly, I take it, as our men believed in the cause for which they\r\nwere fighting--had lost hope and become despondent.  Many of them were\r\nmaking application to be sent North where they might get employment\r\nuntil the war was over, when they could return to their Southern homes.\r\n\r\nFor these and other reasons I was naturally very impatient for the time\r\nto come when I could commence the spring campaign, which I thoroughly\r\nbelieved would close the war.\r\n\r\nThere were two considerations I had to observe, however, and which\r\ndetained me.  One was the fact that the winter had been one of heavy\r\nrains, and the roads were impassable for artillery and teams.  It was\r\nnecessary to wait until they had dried sufficiently to enable us to move\r\nthe wagon trains and artillery necessary to the efficiency of an army\r\noperating in the enemy's country.  The other consideration was that\r\nGeneral Sheridan with the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac was\r\noperating on the north side of the James River, having come down from\r\nthe Shenandoah. It was necessary that I should have his cavalry with me,\r\nand I was therefore obliged to wait until he could join me south of the\r\nJames River.\r\n\r\nLet us now take account of what he was doing.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of March I had heard from Sheridan.  He had met Early between\r\nStaunton and Charlottesville and defeated him, capturing nearly his\r\nentire command.  Early and some of his officers escaped by finding\r\nrefuge in the neighboring houses or in the woods.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th I heard from him again.  He had turned east, to come to\r\nWhite House.  He could not go to Lynchburg as ordered, because the rains\r\nhad been so very heavy and the streams were so very much swollen.  He\r\nhad a pontoon train with him, but it would not reach half way across\r\nsome of the streams, at their then stage of water, which he would have\r\nto get over in going south as first ordered.\r\n\r\nI had supplies sent around to White House for him, and kept the depot\r\nthere open until he arrived.  We had intended to abandon it because the\r\nJames River had now become our base of supplies.\r\n\r\nSheridan had about ten thousand cavalry with him, divided into two\r\ndivisions commanded respectively by Custer and Devin. General Merritt\r\nwas acting as chief of cavalry.  Sheridan moved very light, carrying\r\nonly four days' provisions with him, with a larger supply of coffee,\r\nsalt and other small rations, and a very little else besides ammunition.\r\nThey stopped at Charlottesville and commenced tearing up the railroad\r\nback toward Lynchburg.  He also sent a division along the James River\r\nCanal to destroy locks, culverts etc.  All mills and factories along the\r\nlines of march of his troops were destroyed also.\r\n\r\nSheridan had in this way consumed so much time that his making a march\r\nto White House was now somewhat hazardous.  He determined therefore to\r\nfight his way along the railroad and canal till he was as near to\r\nRichmond as it was possible to get, or until attacked.  He did this,\r\ndestroying the canal as far as Goochland, and the railroad to a point as\r\nnear Richmond as he could get.  On the 10th he was at Columbia.  Negroes\r\nhad joined his column to the number of two thousand or more, and they\r\nassisted considerably in the work of destroying the railroads and the\r\ncanal.  His cavalry was in as fine a condition as when he started,\r\nbecause he had been able to find plenty of forage. He had captured most\r\nof Early's horses and picked up a good many others on the road.  When he\r\nreached Ashland he was assailed by the enemy in force.  He resisted\r\ntheir assault with part of his command, moved quickly across the South\r\nand North Anna, going north, and reached White House safely on the 19th.\r\n\r\nThe time for Sherman to move had to be fixed with reference to the time\r\nhe could get away from Goldsboro where he then was. Supplies had to be\r\ngot up to him which would last him through a long march, as there would\r\nprobably not be much to be obtained in the country through which he\r\nwould pass.  I had to arrange, therefore, that he should start from\r\nwhere he was, in the neighborhood of Goldsboro on the 18th of April, the\r\nearliest day at which he supposed he could be ready.\r\n\r\nSherman was anxious that I should wait where I was until he could come\r\nup, and make a sure thing of it; but I had determined to move as soon as\r\nthe roads and weather would admit of my doing so.  I had been tied down\r\nsomewhat in the matter of fixing any time at my pleasure for starting,\r\nuntil Sheridan, who was on his way from the Shenandoah Valley to join\r\nme, should arrive, as both his presence and that of his cavalry were\r\nnecessary to the execution of the plans which I had in mind.  However,\r\nhaving arrived at White House on the 19th of March, I was enabled to\r\nmake my plans.\r\n\r\nPrompted by my anxiety lest Lee should get away some night before I was\r\naware of it, and having the lead of me, push into North Carolina to join\r\nwith Johnston in attempting to crush out Sherman, I had, as early as the\r\n1st of the month of March, given instructions to the troops around\r\nPetersburg to keep a sharp lookout to see that such a movement should\r\nnot escape their notice, and to be ready strike at once if it was\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that early in the month of March Mr. Davis and General\r\nLee had a consultation about the situation of affairs in and about and\r\nPetersburg, and they both agreed places were no longer tenable for them,\r\nand that they must get away as soon as possible.  They, too, were\r\nwaiting for dry roads, or a condition of the roads which would make it\r\npossible to move.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee, in aid of his plan of escape, and to secure a wider opening\r\nto enable them to reach the Danville Road with greater security than he\r\nwould have in the way the two armies were situated, determined upon an\r\nassault upon the right of our lines around Petersburg.  The night of the\r\n24th of March was fixed upon for this assault, and General Gordon was\r\nassigned to the execution of the plan.  The point between Fort Stedman\r\nand Battery No. 10, where our lines were closest together, was selected\r\nas the point of his attack.  The attack was to be made at night, and the\r\ntroops were to get possession of the higher ground in the rear where\r\nthey supposed we had intrenchments, then sweep to the right and left,\r\ncreate a panic in the lines of our army, and force me to contract my\r\nlines.  Lee hoped this would detain me a few days longer and give him an\r\nopportunity of escape.  The plan was well conceived and the execution of\r\nit very well done indeed, up to the point of carrying a portion of our\r\nline.\r\n\r\nGordon assembled his troops under the cover of night, at the point at\r\nwhich they were to make their charge, and got possession of our\r\npicket-line, entirely without the knowledge of the troops inside of our\r\nmain line of intrenchments; this reduced the distance he would have to\r\ncharge over to not much more than fifty yards.  For some time before the\r\ndeserters had been coming in with great frequency, often bringing their\r\narms with them, and this the Confederate general knew.  Taking advantage\r\nof this knowledge he sent his pickets, with their arms, creeping through\r\nto ours as if to desert.  When they got to our lines they at once took\r\npossession and sent our pickets to the rear as prisoners. In the main\r\nline our men were sleeping serenely, as if in great security.  This plan\r\nwas to have been executed and much damage done before daylight; but the\r\ntroops that were to reinforce Gordon had to be brought from the north\r\nside of the James River and, by some accident on the railroad on their\r\nway over, they were detained for a considerable time; so that it got to\r\nbe nearly daylight before they were ready to make the charge.\r\n\r\nThe charge, however, was successful and almost without loss, the enemy\r\npassing through our lines between Fort Stedman and Battery No. 10.  Then\r\nturning to the right and left they captured the fort and the battery,\r\nwith all the arms and troops in them. Continuing the charge, they also\r\ncarried batteries Eleven and Twelve to our left, which they turned\r\ntoward City Point.\r\n\r\nMeade happened to be at City Point that night, and this break in his\r\nline cut him off from all communication with his headquarters.  Parke,\r\nhowever, commanding the 9th corps when this breach took place,\r\ntelegraphed the facts to Meade's headquarters, and learning that the\r\ngeneral was away, assumed command himself and with commendable\r\npromptitude made all preparations to drive the enemy back.  General\r\nTidball gathered a large number of pieces of artillery and planted them\r\nin rear of the captured works so as to sweep the narrow space of ground\r\nbetween the lines very thoroughly.  Hartranft was soon out with his\r\ndivision, as also was Willcox.  Hartranft to the right of the breach\r\nheaded the rebels off in that direction and rapidly drove them back into\r\nFort Stedman.  On the other side they were driven back into the\r\nintrenchments which they had captured, and batteries eleven and twelve\r\nwere retaken by Willcox early in the morning.\r\n\r\nParke then threw a line around outside of the captured fort and\r\nbatteries, and communication was once more established.  The artillery\r\nfire was kept up so continuously that it was impossible for the\r\nConfederates to retreat, and equally impossible for reinforcements to\r\njoin them.  They all, therefore, fell captives into our hands.  This\r\neffort of Lee's cost him about four thousand men, and resulted in their\r\nkilling, wounding and capturing about two thousand of ours.\r\n\r\nAfter the recapture of the batteries taken by the Confederates, our\r\ntroops made a charge and carried the enemy's intrenched picket line,\r\nwhich they strengthened and held.  This, in turn, gave us but a short\r\ndistance to charge over when our attack came to be made a few days\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe day that Gordon was making dispositions for this attack (24th of\r\nMarch) I issued my orders for the movement to commence on the 29th.\r\nOrd, with three divisions of infantry and Mackenzie's cavalry, was to\r\nmove in advance on the night of the 27th, from the north side of the\r\nJames River and take his place on our extreme left, thirty miles away.\r\nHe left Weitzel with the rest of the Army of the James to hold Bermuda\r\nHundred and the north of the James River.  The engineer brigade was to\r\nbe left at City Point, and Parke's corps in the lines about Petersburg.\r\n(*42)\r\n\r\nOrd was at his place promptly.  Humphreys and Warren were then on our\r\nextreme left with the 2d and 5th corps.  They were directed on the\r\narrival of Ord, and on his getting into position in their places, to\r\ncross Hatcher's Run and extend out west toward Five Forks, the object\r\nbeing to get into a position from which we could strike the South Side\r\nRailroad and ultimately the Danville Railroad.  There was considerable\r\nfighting in taking up these new positions for the 2d and 5th corps, in\r\nwhich the Army of the James had also to participate somewhat, and the\r\nlosses were quite severe.\r\n\r\nThis was what was known as the Battle of White Oak Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW WITH SHERIDAN--GRAND MOVEMENT OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC\r\n--SHERIDAN'S ADVANCE ON FIVE FORKS--BATTLE OF FIVE FORKS--PARKE AND\r\nWRIGHT STORM THE ENEMY'S LINE--BATTLES BEFORE PETERSBURG.\r\n\r\nSheridan reached City Point on the 26th day of March.  His horses, of\r\ncourse, were jaded and many of them had lost their shoes.  A few days of\r\nrest were necessary to recuperate the animals and also to have them shod\r\nand put in condition for moving.  Immediately on General Sheridan's\r\narrival at City Point I prepared his instructions for the move which I\r\nhad decided upon.  The movement was to commence on the 29th of the\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the instructions I had given him, Sheridan walked out of\r\nmy tent, and I followed to have some conversation with him by himself\r\n--not in the presence of anybody else, even of a member of my staff.  In\r\npreparing his instructions I contemplated just what took place; that is\r\nto say, capturing Five Forks, driving the enemy from Petersburg and\r\nRichmond and terminating the contest before separating from the enemy.\r\nBut the Nation had already become restless and discouraged at the\r\nprolongation of the war, and many believed that it would never terminate\r\nexcept by compromise.  Knowing that unless my plan proved an entire\r\nsuccess it would be interpreted as a disastrous defeat, I provided in\r\nthese instructions that in a certain event he was to cut loose from the\r\nArmy of the Potomac and his base of supplies, and living upon the\r\ncountry proceed south by the way of the Danville Railroad, or near it,\r\nacross the Roanoke, get in the rear of Johnston, who was guarding that\r\nroad, and cooperate with Sherman in destroying Johnston; then with these\r\ncombined forces to help carry out the instructions which Sherman already\r\nhad received, to act in cooperation with the armies around Petersburg\r\nand Richmond.\r\n\r\nI saw that after Sheridan had read his instructions he seemed somewhat\r\ndisappointed at the idea, possibly, of having to cut loose again from\r\nthe Army of the Potomac, and place himself between the two main armies\r\nof the enemy.  I said to him: \"General, this portion of your\r\ninstructions I have put in merely as a blind;\" and gave him the reason\r\nfor doing so, heretofore described.  I told him that, as a matter of\r\nfact, I intended to close the war right here, with this movement, and\r\nthat he should go no farther.  His face at once brightened up, and\r\nslapping his hand on his leg he said:  \"I am glad to hear it, and we can\r\ndo it.\"\r\n\r\nSheridan was not however to make his movement against Five Forks until\r\nhe got further instructions from me.\r\n\r\nOne day, after the movement I am about to describe had commenced, and\r\nwhen his cavalry was on our extreme left and far to the rear, south,\r\nSheridan rode up to where my headquarters were then established, at\r\nDabney's Mills.  He met some of my staff officers outside, and was\r\nhighly jubilant over the prospects of success, giving reasons why he\r\nbelieved this would prove the final and successful effort.  Although my\r\nchief-of-staff had urged very strongly that we return to our position\r\nabout City Point and in the lines around Petersburg, he asked Sheridan\r\nto come in to see me and say to me what he had been saying to them.\r\nSheridan felt a little modest about giving his advice where it had not\r\nbeen asked; so one of my staff came in and told me that Sheridan had\r\nwhat they considered important news, and suggested that I send for him.\r\nI did so, and was glad to see the spirit of confidence with which he was\r\nimbued. Knowing as I did from experience, of what great value that\r\nfeeling of confidence by a commander was, I determined to make a\r\nmovement at once, although on account of the rains which had fallen\r\nafter I had started out the roads were still very heavy.  Orders were\r\ngiven accordingly.\r\n\r\nFinally the 29th of March came, and fortunately there having been a few\r\ndays free from rain, the surface of the ground was dry, giving\r\nindications that the time had come when we could move.  On that date I\r\nmoved out with all the army available after leaving sufficient force to\r\nhold the line about Petersburg.  It soon set in raining again however,\r\nand in a very short time the roads became practically impassable for\r\nteams, and almost so for cavalry.  Sometimes a horse or mule would be\r\nstanding apparently on firm ground, when all at once one foot would\r\nsink, and as he commenced scrambling to catch himself all his feet would\r\nsink and he would have to be drawn by hand out of the quicksands so\r\ncommon in that part of Virginia and other southern States.  It became\r\nnecessary therefore to build corduroy roads every foot of the way as we\r\nadvanced, to move our artillery upon.  The army had become so accustomed\r\nto this kind of work, and were so well prepared for it, that it was done\r\nvery rapidly.  The next day, March 30th, we had made sufficient progress\r\nto the south-west to warrant me in starting Sheridan with his cavalry\r\nover by Dinwiddie with instructions to then come up by the road leading\r\nnorth-west to Five Forks, thus menacing the right of Lee's line.\r\n\r\nThis movement was made for the purpose of extending our lines to the\r\nwest as far as practicable towards the enemy's extreme right, or Five\r\nForks.  The column moving detached from the army still in the trenches\r\nwas, excluding the cavalry, very small.  The forces in the trenches were\r\nthemselves extending to the left flank. Warren was on the extreme left\r\nwhen the extension began, but Humphreys was marched around later and\r\nthrown into line between him and Five Forks.\r\n\r\nMy hope was that Sheridan would be able to carry Five Forks, get on the\r\nenemy's right flank and rear, and force them to weaken their centre to\r\nprotect their right so that an assault in the centre might be\r\nsuccessfully made.  General Wright's corps had been designated to make\r\nthis assault, which I intended to order as soon as information reached\r\nme of Sheridan's success.  He was to move under cover as close to the\r\nenemy as he could get.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to suppose that Lee would understand my design to be to\r\nget up to the South Side and ultimately to the Danville Railroad, as\r\nsoon as he had heard of the movement commenced on the 29th.  These roads\r\nwere so important to his very existence while he remained in Richmond\r\nand Petersburg, and of such vital importance to him even in case of\r\nretreat, that naturally he would make most strenuous efforts to defend\r\nthem.  He did on the 30th send Pickett with five brigades to reinforce\r\nFive Forks.  He also sent around to the right of his army some two or\r\nthree other divisions, besides directing that other troops be held in\r\nreadiness on the north side of the James River to come over on call.  He\r\ncame over himself to superintend in person the defence of his right\r\nflank.\r\n\r\nSheridan moved back to Dinwiddie Court-House on the night of the 30th,\r\nand then took a road leading north-west to Five Forks.  He had only his\r\ncavalry with him.  Soon encountering the rebel cavalry he met with a\r\nvery stout resistance.  He gradually drove them back however until in\r\nthe neighborhood of Five Forks.  Here he had to encounter other troops\r\nbesides those he had been contending with, and was forced to give way.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of affairs he notified me of what had taken place and\r\nstated that he was falling back toward Dinwiddie gradually and slowly,\r\nand asked me to send Wright's corps to his assistance.  I replied to him\r\nthat it was impossible to send Wright's corps because that corps was\r\nalready in line close up to the enemy, where we should want to assault\r\nwhen the proper time came, and was besides a long distance from him; but\r\nthe 2d (Humphreys's) and 5th (Warren's) corps were on our extreme left\r\nand a little to the rear of it in a position to threaten the left flank\r\nof the enemy at Five Forks, and that I would send Warren.\r\n\r\nAccordingly orders were sent to Warren to move at once that night (the\r\n31st) to Dinwiddie Court House and put himself in communication with\r\nSheridan as soon as possible, and report to him.  He was very slow in\r\nmoving, some of his troops not starting until after 5 o'clock next\r\nmorning.  When he did move it was done very deliberately, and on\r\narriving at Gravelly Run he found the stream swollen from the recent\r\nrains so that he regarded it as not fordable.  Sheridan of course knew\r\nof his coming, and being impatient to get the troops up as soon as\r\npossible, sent orders to him to hasten.  He was also hastened or at\r\nleast ordered to move up rapidly by General Meade.  He now felt that he\r\ncould not cross that creek without bridges, and his orders were changed\r\nto move so as to strike the pursuing enemy in flank or get in their\r\nrear; but he was so late in getting up that Sheridan determined to move\r\nforward without him.  However, Ayres's division of Warren's corps\r\nreached him in time to be in the fight all day, most of the time\r\nseparated from the remainder of the 5th corps and fighting directly\r\nunder Sheridan.\r\n\r\nWarren reported to Sheridan about 11 o'clock on the 1st, but the whole\r\nof his troops were not up so as to be much engaged until late in the\r\nafternoon.  Griffin's division in backing to get out of the way of a\r\nsevere cross fire of the enemy was found marching away from the\r\nfighting.  This did not continue long, however; the division was brought\r\nback and with Ayres's division did most excellent service during the\r\nday.  Crawford's division of the same corps had backed still farther\r\noff, and although orders were sent repeatedly to bring it up, it was\r\nlate before it finally got to where it could be of material assistance.\r\nOnce there it did very excellent service.\r\n\r\nSheridan succeeded by the middle of the afternoon or a little later, in\r\nadvancing up to the point from which to make his designed assault upon\r\nFive Forks itself.  He was very impatient to make the assault and have\r\nit all over before night, because the ground he occupied would be\r\nuntenable for him in bivouac during the night.  Unless the assault was\r\nmade and was successful, he would be obliged to return to Dinwiddie\r\nCourt-House, or even further than that for the night.\r\n\r\nIt was at this junction of affairs that Sheridan wanted to get\r\nCrawford's division in hand, and he also wanted Warren.  He sent staff\r\nofficer after staff officer in search of Warren, directing that general\r\nto report to him, but they were unable to find him.  At all events\r\nSheridan was unable to get that officer to him.  Finally he went\r\nhimself.  He issued an order relieving Warren and assigning Griffin to\r\nthe command of the 5th corps. The troops were then brought up and the\r\nassault successfully made.\r\n\r\nI was so much dissatisfied with Warren's dilatory movements in the\r\nbattle of White Oak Road and in his failure to reach Sheridan in time,\r\nthat I was very much afraid that at the last moment he would fail\r\nSheridan.  He was a man of fine intelligence, great earnestness, quick\r\nperception, and could make his dispositions as quickly as any officer,\r\nunder difficulties where he was forced to act.  But I had before\r\ndiscovered a defect which was beyond his control, that was very\r\nprejudicial to his usefulness in emergencies like the one just before\r\nus.  He could see every danger at a glance before he had encountered it.\r\nHe would not only make preparations to meet the danger which might\r\noccur, but he would inform his commanding officer what others should do\r\nwhile he was executing his move.\r\n\r\nI had sent a staff officer to General Sheridan to call his attention to\r\nthese defects, and to say that as much as I liked General Warren, now\r\nwas not a time when we could let our personal feelings for any one stand\r\nin the way of success; and if his removal was necessary to success, not\r\nto hesitate.  It was upon that authorization that Sheridan removed\r\nWarren.  I was very sorry that it had been done, and regretted still\r\nmore that I had not long before taken occasion to assign him to another\r\nfield of duty.\r\n\r\nIt was dusk when our troops under Sheridan went over the parapets of the\r\nenemy.  The two armies were mingled together there for a time in such\r\nmanner that it was almost a question which one was going to demand the\r\nsurrender of the other.  Soon, however, the enemy broke and ran in every\r\ndirection; some six thousand prisoners, besides artillery and small-arms\r\nin large quantities, falling into our hands.  The flying troops were\r\npursued in different directions, the cavalry and 5th corps under\r\nSheridan pursuing the larger body which moved north-west.\r\n\r\nThis pursuit continued until about nine o'clock at night, when Sheridan\r\nhalted his troops, and knowing the importance to him of the part of the\r\nenemy's line which had been captured, returned, sending the 5th corps\r\nacross Hatcher's Run to just south-west of Petersburg, and facing them\r\ntoward it.  Merritt, with the cavalry, stopped and bivouacked west of\r\nFive Forks.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition which affairs were in on the night of the 1st of\r\nApril.  I then issued orders for an assault by Wright and Parke at four\r\no'clock on the morning of the 2d.  I also ordered the 2d corps, General\r\nHumphreys, and General Ord with the Army of the James, on the left, to\r\nhold themselves in readiness to take any advantage that could be taken\r\nfrom weakening in their front.\r\n\r\nI notified Mr. Lincoln at City Point of the success of the day; in fact\r\nI had reported to him during the day and evening as I got news, because\r\nhe was so much interested in the movements taking place that I wanted to\r\nrelieve his mind as much as I could.  I notified Weitzel on the north\r\nside of the James River, directing him, also, to keep close up to the\r\nenemy, and take advantage of the withdrawal of troops from there to\r\npromptly enter the city of Richmond.\r\n\r\nI was afraid that Lee would regard the possession of Five Forks as of so\r\nmuch importance that he would make a last desperate effort to retake it,\r\nrisking everything upon the cast of a single die.  It was for this\r\nreason that I had ordered the assault to take place at once, as soon as\r\nI had received the news of the capture of Five Forks.  The corps\r\ncommanders, however, reported that it was so dark that the men could not\r\nsee to move, and it would be impossible to make the assault then. But we\r\nkept up a continuous artillery fire upon the enemy around the whole line\r\nincluding that north of the James River, until it was light enough to\r\nmove, which was about a quarter to five in the morning.\r\n\r\nAt that hour Parke's and Wright's corps moved out as directed, brushed\r\nthe _abatis_ from their front as they advanced under a heavy fire of\r\nmusketry and artillery, and went without flinching directly on till they\r\nmounted the parapets and threw themselves inside of the enemy's line.\r\nParke, who was on the right, swept down to the right and captured a very\r\nconsiderable length of line in that direction, but at that point the\r\nouter was so near the inner line which closely enveloped the city of\r\nPetersburg that he could make no advance forward and, in fact, had a\r\nvery serious task to turn the lines which he had captured to the defence\r\nof his own troops and to hold them; but he succeeded in this.\r\n\r\nWright swung around to his left and moved to Hatcher's Run, sweeping\r\neverything before him.  The enemy had traverses in rear of his captured\r\nline, under cover of which he made something of a stand, from one to\r\nanother, as Wright moved on; but the latter met no serious obstacle.  As\r\nyou proceed to the left the outer line becomes gradually much farther\r\nfrom the inner one, and along about Hatcher's Run they must be nearly\r\ntwo miles apart. Both Parke and Wright captured a considerable amount of\r\nartillery and some prisoners--Wright about three thousand of them.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Ord and Humphreys, in obedience to the instructions they\r\nhad received, had succeeded by daylight, or very early in the morning,\r\nin capturing the intrenched picket-lines in their front; and before\r\nWright got up to that point, Ord had also succeeded in getting inside of\r\nthe enemy's intrenchments.  The second corps soon followed; and the\r\nouter works of Petersburg were in the hands of the National troops,\r\nnever to be wrenched from them again.  When Wright reached Hatcher's\r\nRun, he sent a regiment to destroy the South Side Railroad just outside\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nMy headquarters were still at Dabney's saw-mills.  As soon as I received\r\nthe news of Wright's success, I sent dispatches announcing the fact to\r\nall points around the line, including the troops at Bermuda Hundred and\r\nthose on the north side of the James, and to the President at City\r\nPoint.  Further dispatches kept coming in, and as they did I sent the\r\nadditional news to these points.  Finding at length that they were all\r\nin, I mounted my horse to join the troops who were inside the works.\r\nWhen I arrived there I rode my horse over the parapet just as Wright's\r\nthree thousand prisoners were coming out.  I was soon joined inside by\r\nGeneral Meade and his staff.\r\n\r\nLee made frantic efforts to recover at least part of the lost ground.\r\nParke on our right was repeatedly assaulted, but repulsed every effort.\r\nBefore noon Longstreet was ordered up from the north side of the James\r\nRiver thus bringing the bulk of Lee's army around to the support of his\r\nextreme right.  As soon as I learned this I notified Weitzel and\r\ndirected him to keep up close to the enemy and to have Hartsuff,\r\ncommanding the Bermuda Hundred front, to do the same thing, and if they\r\nfound any break to go in; Hartsuff especially should do so, for this\r\nwould separate Richmond and Petersburg.\r\n\r\nSheridan, after he had returned to Five Forks, swept down to Petersburg,\r\ncoming in on our left.  This gave us a continuous line from the\r\nAppomattox River below the city to the same river above.  At eleven\r\no'clock, not having heard from Sheridan, I reinforced Parke with two\r\nbrigades from City Point.  With this additional force he completed his\r\ncaptured works for better defence, and built back from his right, so as\r\nto protect his flank.  He also carried in and made an _abatis_ between\r\nhimself and the enemy.  Lee brought additional troops and artillery\r\nagainst Parke even after this was done, and made several assaults with\r\nvery heavy losses.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had in addition to their intrenched line close up to\r\nPetersburg, two enclosed works outside of it, Fort Gregg and Fort\r\nWhitworth.  We thought it had now become necessary to carry them by\r\nassault.  About one o'clock in the day, Fort Gregg was assaulted by\r\nFoster's division of the 24th corps (Gibbon's), supported by two\r\nbrigades from Ord's command.  The battle was desperate and the National\r\ntroops were repulsed several times; but it was finally carried, and\r\nimmediately the troops in Fort Whitworth evacuated the place.  The guns\r\nof Fort Gregg were turned upon the retreating enemy, and the commanding\r\nofficer with some sixty of the men of Fort Whitworth surrendered.\r\n\r\nI had ordered Miles in the morning to report to Sheridan.  In moving to\r\nexecute this order he came upon the enemy at the intersection of the\r\nWhite Oak Road and the Claiborne Road.  The enemy fell back to\r\nSutherland Station on the South Side Road and were followed by Miles.\r\nThis position, naturally a strong and defensible one, was also strongly\r\nintrenched.  Sheridan now came up and Miles asked permission from him to\r\nmake the assault, which Sheridan gave.  By this time Humphreys had got\r\nthrough the outer works in his front, and came up also and assumed\r\ncommand over Miles, who commanded a division in his corps.  I had sent\r\nan order to Humphreys to turn to his right and move towards Petersburg.\r\nThis order he now got, and started off, thus leaving Miles alone.  The\r\nlatter made two assaults, both of which failed, and he had to fall back\r\na few hundred yards.\r\n\r\nHearing that Miles had been left in this position, I directed Humphreys\r\nto send a division back to his relief.  He went himself.\r\n\r\nSheridan before starting to sweep down to Petersburg had sent Merritt\r\nwith his cavalry to the west to attack some Confederate cavalry that had\r\nassembled there.  Merritt drove them north to the Appomattox River.\r\nSheridan then took the enemy at Sutherland Station on the reverse side\r\nfrom where Miles was, and the two together captured the place, with a\r\nlarge number of prisoners and some pieces of artillery, and put the\r\nremainder, portions of three Confederate corps, to flight.  Sheridan\r\nfollowed, and drove them until night, when further pursuit was stopped.\r\nMiles bivouacked for the night on the ground which he with Sheridan had\r\ncarried so handsomely by assault.  I cannot explain the situation here\r\nbetter than by giving my dispatch to City Point that evening:\r\n\r\n\r\nBOYDTON ROAD, NEAR PETERSBURG, April 2, 1865.--4.40 P.M.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL T. S. BOWERS, City Point.\r\n\r\nWe are now up and have a continuous line of troops, and in a few hours\r\nwill be intrenched from the Appomattox below Petersburg to the river\r\nabove.  Heth's and Wilcox's divisions, such part of them as were not\r\ncaptured, were cut off from town, either designedly on their part or\r\nbecause they could not help it. Sheridan with the cavalry and 5th corps\r\nis above them.  Miles's division, 2d corps, was sent from the White Oak\r\nRoad to Sutherland Station on the South Side Railroad, where he met\r\nthem, and at last accounts was engaged with them.  Not knowing whether\r\nSheridan would get up in time, General Humphreys was sent with another\r\ndivision from here.  The whole captures since the army started out\r\ngunning will amount to not less than twelve thousand men, and probably\r\nfifty pieces of artillery.  I do not know the number of men and guns\r\naccurately however.  * * *  I think the President might come out and pay\r\nus a visit tomorrow.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the night of April 2d our line was intrenched from the river\r\nabove to the river below.  I ordered a bombardment to be commenced the\r\nnext morning at five A.M., to be followed by an assault at six o'clock;\r\nbut the enemy evacuated Petersburg early in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTURE OF PETERSBURG--MEETING PRESIDENT LINCOLN IN PETERSBURG--THE\r\nCAPTURE OF RICHMOND--PURSUING THE ENEMY--VISIT TO SHERIDAN AND MEADE.\r\n\r\nGeneral Meade and I entered Petersburg on the morning of the 3d and took\r\na position under cover of a house which protected us from the enemy's\r\nmusketry which was flying thick and fast there.  As we would\r\noccasionally look around the corner we could see the streets and the\r\nAppomattox bottom, presumably near the bridge, packed with the\r\nConfederate army.  I did not have artillery brought up, because I was\r\nsure Lee was trying to make his escape, and I wanted to push immediately\r\nin pursuit.  At all events I had not the heart to turn the artillery\r\nupon such a mass of defeated and fleeing men, and I hoped to capture\r\nthem soon.\r\n\r\nSoon after the enemy had entirely evacuated Petersburg, a man came in\r\nwho represented himself to be an engineer of the Army of Northern\r\nVirginia.  He said that Lee had for some time been at work preparing a\r\nstrong enclosed intrenchment, into which he would throw himself when\r\nforced out of Petersburg, and fight his final battle there; that he was\r\nactually at that time drawing his troops from Richmond, and falling back\r\ninto this prepared work. This statement was made to General Meade and\r\nmyself when we were together.  I had already given orders for the\r\nmovement up the south side of the Appomattox for the purpose of heading\r\noff Lee; but Meade was so much impressed by this man's story that he\r\nthought we ought to cross the Appomattox there at once and move against\r\nLee in his new position.  I knew that Lee was no fool, as he would have\r\nbeen to have put himself and his army between two formidable streams\r\nlike the James and Appomattox rivers, and between two such armies as\r\nthose of the Potomac and the James. Then these streams coming together\r\nas they did to the east of him, it would be only necessary to close up\r\nin the west to have him thoroughly cut off from all supplies or\r\npossibility of reinforcement.  It would only have been a question of\r\ndays, and not many of them, if he had taken the position assigned to him\r\nby the so-called engineer, when he would have been obliged to surrender\r\nhis army.  Such is one of the ruses resorted to in war to deceive your\r\nantagonist.  My judgment was that Lee would necessarily have to evacuate\r\nRichmond, and that the only course for him to pursue would be to follow\r\nthe Danville Road. Accordingly my object was to secure a point on that\r\nroad south of Lee, and I told Meade this.  He suggested that if Lee was\r\ngoing that way we would follow him.  My reply was that we did not want\r\nto follow him; we wanted to get ahead of him and cut him off, and if he\r\nwould only stay in the position he (Meade) believed him to be in at that\r\ntime, I wanted nothing better; that when we got in possession of the\r\nDanville Railroad, at its crossing of the Appomattox River, if we still\r\nfound him between the two rivers, all we had to do was to move eastward\r\nand close him up.  That we would then have all the advantage we could\r\npossibly have by moving directly against him from Petersburg, even if he\r\nremained in the position assigned him by the engineer officer.\r\n\r\nI had held most of the command aloof from the intrenchments, so as to\r\nstart them out on the Danville Road early in the morning, supposing that\r\nLee would be gone during the night.  During the night I strengthened\r\nSheridan by sending him Humphreys's corps.\r\n\r\nLee, as we now know, had advised the authorities at Richmond, during the\r\nday, of the condition of affairs, and told them it would be impossible\r\nfor him to hold out longer than night, if he could hold out that long.\r\nDavis was at church when he received Lee's dispatch.  The congregation\r\nwas dismissed with the notice that there would be no evening service.\r\nThe rebel government left Richmond about two o'clock in the afternoon of\r\nthe 2d.\r\n\r\nAt night Lee ordered his troops to assemble at Amelia Court House, his\r\nobject being to get away, join Johnston if possible, and to try to crush\r\nSherman before I could get there.  As soon as I was sure of this I\r\nnotified Sheridan and directed him to move out on the Danville Railroad\r\nto the south side of the Appomattox River as speedily as possible.  He\r\nreplied that he already had some of his command nine miles out.  I then\r\nordered the rest of the Army of the Potomac under Meade to follow the\r\nsame road in the morning.  Parke's corps followed by the same road, and\r\nthe Army of the James was directed to follow the road which ran\r\nalongside of the South Side Railroad to Burke's Station, and to repair\r\nthe railroad and telegraph as they proceeded.  That road was a 5 feet\r\ngauge, while our rolling stock was all of the 4 feet 8 1/2 inches gauge;\r\nconsequently the rail on one side of the track had to be taken up\r\nthroughout the whole length and relaid so as to conform to the gauge of\r\nour cars and locomotives.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was at City Point at the time, and had been for some days.\r\nI would have let him know what I contemplated doing, only while I felt a\r\nstrong conviction that the move was going to be successful, yet it might\r\nnot prove so; and then I would have only added another to the many\r\ndisappointments he had been suffering for the past three years.  But\r\nwhen we started out he saw that we were moving for a purpose, and\r\nbidding us Godspeed, remained there to hear the result.\r\n\r\nThe next morning after the capture of Petersburg, I telegraphed Mr.\r\nLincoln asking him to ride out there and see me, while I would await his\r\narrival.  I had started all the troops out early in the morning, so that\r\nafter the National army left Petersburg there was not a soul to be seen,\r\nnot even an animal in the streets.  There was absolutely no one there,\r\nexcept my staff officers and, possibly, a small escort of cavalry.  We\r\nhad selected the piazza of a deserted house, and occupied it until the\r\nPresident arrived.\r\n\r\nAbout the first thing that Mr. Lincoln said to me, after warm\r\ncongratulations for the victory, and thanks both to myself and to the\r\narmy which had accomplished it, was:  \"Do you know, general, that I have\r\nhad a sort of a sneaking idea for some days that you intended to do\r\nsomething like this.\"  Our movements having been successful up to this\r\npoint, I no longer had any object in concealing from the President all\r\nmy movements, and the objects I had in view.  He remained for some days\r\nnear City Point, and I communicated with him frequently and fully by\r\ntelegraph.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln knew that it had been arranged for Sherman to join me at a\r\nfixed time, to co-operate in the destruction of Lee's army.  I told him\r\nthat I had been very anxious to have the Eastern armies vanquish their\r\nold enemy who had so long resisted all their repeated and gallant\r\nattempts to subdue them or drive them from their capital.  The Western\r\narmies had been in the main successful until they had conquered all the\r\nterritory from the Mississippi River to the State of North Carolina, and\r\nwere now almost ready to knock at the back door of Richmond, asking\r\nadmittance.  I said to him that if the Western armies should be even\r\nupon the field, operating against Richmond and Lee, the credit would be\r\ngiven to them for the capture, by politicians and non-combatants from\r\nthe section of country which those troops hailed from.  It might lead to\r\ndisagreeable bickerings between members of Congress of the East and\r\nthose of the West in some of their debates.  Western members might be\r\nthrowing it up to the members of the East that in the suppression of the\r\nrebellion they were not able to capture an army, or to accomplish much\r\nin the way of contributing toward that end, but had to wait until the\r\nWestern armies had conquered all the territory south and west of them,\r\nand then come on to help them capture the only army they had been\r\nengaged with.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said he saw that now, but had never thought of it before,\r\nbecause his anxiety was so great that he did not care where the aid came\r\nfrom so the work was done.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Potomac has every reason to be proud of its four years'\r\nrecord in the suppression of the rebellion.  The army it had to fight\r\nwas the protection to the capital of a people which was attempting to\r\nfound a nation upon the territory of the United States.  Its loss would\r\nbe the loss of the cause.  Every energy, therefore, was put forth by the\r\nConfederacy to protect and maintain their capital.  Everything else\r\nwould go if it went. Lee's army had to be strengthened to enable it to\r\nmaintain its position, no matter what territory was wrested from the\r\nSouth in another quarter.\r\n\r\nI never expected any such bickering as I have indicated, between the\r\nsoldiers of the two sections; and, fortunately, there has been none\r\nbetween the politicians.  Possibly I am the only one who thought of the\r\nliability of such a state of things in advance.\r\n\r\nWhen our conversation was at an end Mr. Lincoln mounted his horse and\r\nstarted on his return to City Point, while I and my staff started to\r\njoin the army, now a good many miles in advance.  Up to this time I had\r\nnot received the report of the capture of Richmond.\r\n\r\nSoon after I left President Lincoln I received a dispatch from General\r\nWeitzel which notified me that he had taken possession of Richmond at\r\nabout 8.15 o'clock in the morning of that day, the 3d, and that he had\r\nfound the city on fire in two places. The city was in the most utter\r\nconfusion.  The authorities had taken the precaution to empty all the\r\nliquor into the gutter, and to throw out the provisions which the\r\nConfederate government had left, for the people to gather up.  The city\r\nhad been deserted by the authorities, civil and military, without any\r\nnotice whatever that they were about to leave.  In fact, up to the very\r\nhour of the evacuation the people had been led to believe that Lee had\r\ngained an important victory somewhere around Petersburg.\r\n\r\nWeitzel's command found evidence of great demoralization in Lee's army,\r\nthere being still a great many men and even officers in the town.  The\r\ncity was on fire.  Our troops were directed to extinguish the flames,\r\nwhich they finally succeeded in doing. The fire had been started by some\r\none connected with the retreating army.  All authorities deny that it\r\nwas authorized, and I presume it was the work of excited men who were\r\nleaving what they regarded as their capital and may have felt that it\r\nwas better to destroy it than have it fall into the hands of their\r\nenemy.  Be that as it may, the National troops found the city in flames,\r\nand used every effort to extinguish them.\r\n\r\nThe troops that had formed Lee's right, a great many of them, were cut\r\noff from getting back into Petersburg, and were pursued by our cavalry\r\nso hotly and closely that they threw away caissons, ammunition,\r\nclothing, and almost everything to lighten their loads, and pushed along\r\nup the Appomattox River until finally they took water and crossed over.\r\n\r\nI left Mr. Lincoln and started, as I have already said, to join the\r\ncommand, which halted at Sutherland Station, about nine miles out.  We\r\nhad still time to march as much farther, and time was an object; but the\r\nroads were bad and the trains belonging to the advance corps had blocked\r\nup the road so that it was impossible to get on.  Then, again, our\r\ncavalry had struck some of the enemy and were pursuing them; and the\r\norders were that the roads should be given up to the cavalry whenever\r\nthey appeared.  This caused further delay.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wright, who was in command of one of the corps which were left\r\nback, thought to gain time by letting his men go into bivouac and trying\r\nto get up some rations for them, and clearing out the road, so that when\r\nthey did start they would be uninterrupted.  Humphreys, who was far\r\nahead, was also out of rations.  They did not succeed in getting them up\r\nthrough the night; but the Army of the Potomac, officers and men, were\r\nso elated by the reflection that at last they were following up a\r\nvictory to its end, that they preferred marching without rations to\r\nrunning a possible risk of letting the enemy elude them.  So the march\r\nwas resumed at three o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nMerritt's cavalry had struck the enemy at Deep Creek, and driven them\r\nnorth to the Appomattox, where, I presume, most of them were forced to\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 4th I learned that Lee had ordered rations up from\r\nDanville for his famishing army, and that they were to meet him at\r\nFarmville.  This showed that Lee had already abandoned the idea of\r\nfollowing the railroad down to Danville, but had determined to go\r\nfarther west, by the way of Farmville.  I notified Sheridan of this and\r\ndirected him to get possession of the road before the supplies could\r\nreach Lee.  He responded that he had already sent Crook's division to\r\nget upon the road between Burkesville and Jetersville, then to face\r\nnorth and march along the road upon the latter place; and he thought\r\nCrook must be there now.  The bulk of the army moved directly for\r\nJetersville by two roads.\r\n\r\nAfter I had received the dispatch from Sheridan saying that Crook was on\r\nthe Danville Road, I immediately ordered Meade to make a forced march\r\nwith the Army of the Potomac, and to send Parke's corps across from the\r\nroad they were on to the South Side Railroad, to fall in the rear of the\r\nArmy of the James and to protect the railroad which that army was\r\nrepairing as it went along.\r\n\r\nOur troops took possession of Jetersville and in the telegraph office,\r\nthey found a dispatch from Lee, ordering two hundred thousand rations\r\nfrom Danville.  The dispatch had not been sent, but Sheridan sent a\r\nspecial messenger with it to Burkesville and had it forwarded from\r\nthere.  In the meantime, however, dispatches from other sources had\r\nreached Danville, and they knew there that our army was on the line of\r\nthe road; so that they sent no further supplies from that quarter.\r\n\r\nAt this time Merritt and Mackenzie, with the cavalry, were off between\r\nthe road which the Army of the Potomac was marching on and the\r\nAppomattox River, and were attacking the enemy in flank.  They picked up\r\na great many prisoners and forced the abandonment of some property.\r\n\r\nLee intrenched himself at Amelia Court House, and also his advance north\r\nof Jetersville, and sent his troops out to collect forage.  The country\r\nwas very poor and afforded but very little.  His foragers scattered a\r\ngreat deal; many of them were picked up by our men, and many others\r\nnever returned to the Army of Northern Virginia.\r\n\r\nGriffin's corps was intrenched across the railroad south of Jetersville,\r\nand Sheridan notified me of the situation.  I again ordered Meade up\r\nwith all dispatch, Sheridan having but the one corps of infantry with a\r\nlittle cavalry confronting Lee's entire army.  Meade, always prompt in\r\nobeying orders, now pushed forward with great energy, although he was\r\nhimself sick and hardly able to be out of bed.  Humphreys moved at two,\r\nand Wright at three o'clock in the morning, without rations, as I have\r\nsaid, the wagons being far in the rear.\r\n\r\nI stayed that night at Wilson's Station on the South Side Railroad.  On\r\nthe morning of the 5th I sent word to Sheridan of the progress Meade was\r\nmaking, and suggested that he might now attack Lee.  We had now no other\r\nobjective than the Confederate armies, and I was anxious to close the\r\nthing up at once.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th I marched again with Ord's command until within about ten\r\nmiles of Burkesville, where I stopped to let his army pass. I then\r\nreceived from Sheridan the following dispatch:\r\n\r\n\"The whole of Lee's army is at or near Amelia Court House, and on this\r\nside of it.  General Davies, whom I sent out to Painesville on their\r\nright flank, has just captured six pieces of artillery and some wagons.\r\nWe can capture the Army of Northern Virginia if force enough can be\r\nthrown to this point, and then advance upon it.  My cavalry was at\r\nBurkesville yesterday, and six miles beyond, on the Danville Road, last\r\nnight.  General Lee is at Amelia Court House in person.  They are out of\r\nrations, or nearly so.  They were advancing up the railroad towards\r\nBurkesville yesterday, when we intercepted them at this point.\"\r\n\r\nIt now became a life and death struggle with Lee to get south to his\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nSheridan, thinking the enemy might turn off immediately towards\r\nFarmville, moved Davies's brigade of cavalry out to watch him. Davies\r\nfound the movement had already commenced.  He attacked and drove away\r\ntheir cavalry which was escorting wagons to the west, capturing and\r\nburning 180 wagons.  He also captured five pieces of artillery.  The\r\nConfederate infantry then moved against him and probably would have\r\nhandled him very roughly, but Sheridan had sent two more brigades of\r\ncavalry to follow Davies, and they came to his relief in time.  A sharp\r\nengagement took place between these three brigades of cavalry and the\r\nenemy's infantry, but the latter was repulsed.\r\n\r\nMeade himself reached Jetersville about two o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nbut in advance of all his troops.  The head of Humphreys's corps\r\nfollowed in about an hour afterwards. Sheridan stationed the troops as\r\nthey came up, at Meade's request, the latter still being very sick.  He\r\nextended two divisions of this corps off to the west of the road to the\r\nleft of Griffin's corps, and one division to the right.  The cavalry by\r\nthis time had also come up, and they were put still farther off to the\r\nleft, Sheridan feeling certain that there lay the route by which the\r\nenemy intended to escape.  He wanted to attack, feeling that if time was\r\ngiven, the enemy would get away; but Meade prevented this, preferring to\r\nwait till his troops were all up.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Sheridan sent me a letter which had been handed to him\r\nby a colored man, with a note from himself saying that he wished I was\r\nthere myself.  The letter was dated Amelia Court House, April 5th, and\r\nsigned by Colonel Taylor.  It was to his mother, and showed the\r\ndemoralization of the Confederate army. Sheridan's note also gave me the\r\ninformation as here related of the movements of that day.  I received a\r\nsecond message from Sheridan on the 5th, in which he urged more\r\nemphatically the importance of my presence.  This was brought to me by a\r\nscout in gray uniform.  It was written on tissue paper, and wrapped up\r\nin tin-foil such as chewing tobacco is folded in.  This was a precaution\r\ntaken so that if the scout should be captured he could take this\r\ntin-foil out of his pocket and putting it into his mouth, chew it.  It\r\nwould cause no surprise at all to see a Confederate soldier chewing\r\ntobacco. It was nearly night when this letter was received.  I gave Ord\r\ndirections to continue his march to Burkesville and there intrench\r\nhimself for the night, and in the morning to move west to cut off all\r\nthe roads between there and Farmville.\r\n\r\nI then started with a few of my staff and a very small escort of\r\ncavalry, going directly through the woods, to join Meade's army.  The\r\ndistance was about sixteen miles; but the night being dark our progress\r\nwas slow through the woods in the absence of direct roads.  However, we\r\ngot to the outposts about ten o'clock in the evening, and after some\r\nlittle parley convinced the sentinels of our identity and were conducted\r\nin to where Sheridan was bivouacked.  We talked over the situation for\r\nsome little time, Sheridan explaining to me what he thought Lee was\r\ntrying to do, and that Meade's orders, if carried out, moving to the\r\nright flank, would give him the coveted opportunity of escaping us and\r\nputting us in rear of him.\r\n\r\nWe then together visited Meade, reaching his headquarters about\r\nmidnight.  I explained to Meade that we did not want to follow the\r\nenemy; we wanted to get ahead of him, and that his orders would allow\r\nthe enemy to escape, and besides that, I had no doubt that Lee was\r\nmoving right then.  Meade changed his orders at once.  They were now\r\ngiven for an advance on Amelia Court House, at an early hour in the\r\nmorning, as the army then lay; that is, the infantry being across the\r\nrailroad, most of it to the west of the road, with the cavalry swung out\r\nstill farther to the left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF SAILOR'S CREEK--ENGAGEMENT AT FARMVILLE--CORRESPONDENCE WITH\r\nGENERAL LEE--SHERIDAN INTERCEPTS THE ENEMY.\r\n\r\nThe Appomattox, going westward, takes a long sweep to the south-west\r\nfrom the neighborhood of the Richmond and Danville Railroad bridge, and\r\nthen trends north-westerly.  Sailor's Creek, an insignificant stream,\r\nrunning northward, empties into the Appomattox between the High Bridge\r\nand Jetersville.  Near the High Bridge the stage road from Petersburg to\r\nLynchburg crosses the Appomattox River, also on a bridge.  The railroad\r\nruns on the north side of the river to Farmville, a few miles west, and\r\nfrom there, recrossing, continues on the south side of it.  The roads\r\ncoming up from the south-east to Farmville cross the Appomattox River\r\nthere on a bridge and run on the north side, leaving the Lynchburg and\r\nPetersburg Railroad well to the left.\r\n\r\nLee, in pushing out from Amelia Court House, availed himself of all the\r\nroads between the Danville Road and Appomattox River to move upon, and\r\nnever permitted the head of his columns to stop because of any fighting\r\nthat might be going on in his rear.  In this way he came very near\r\nsucceeding in getting to his provision trains and eluding us with at\r\nleast part of his army.\r\n\r\nAs expected, Lee's troops had moved during the night before, and our\r\narmy in moving upon Amelia Court House soon encountered them.  There was\r\na good deal of fighting before Sailor's Creek was reached.  Our cavalry\r\ncharged in upon a body of theirs which was escorting a wagon train in\r\norder to get it past our left.  A severe engagement ensued, in which we\r\ncaptured many prisoners, and many men also were killed and wounded.\r\nThere was as much gallantry displayed by some of the Confederates in\r\nthese little engagements as was displayed at any time during the war,\r\nnotwithstanding the sad defeats of the past week.\r\n\r\nThe armies finally met on Sailor's Creek, when a heavy engagement took\r\nplace, in which infantry, artillery and cavalry were all brought into\r\naction.  Our men on the right, as they were brought in against the\r\nenemy, came in on higher ground, and upon his flank, giving us every\r\nadvantage to be derived from the lay of the country.  Our firing was\r\nalso very much more rapid, because the enemy commenced his retreat\r\nwestward and in firing as he retreated had to turn around every time he\r\nfired.  The enemy's loss was very heavy, as well in killed and wounded\r\nas in captures.  Some six general officers fell into our hands in this\r\nengagement, and seven thousand men were made prisoners.  This engagement\r\nwas commenced in the middle of the afternoon of the 6th, and the retreat\r\nand pursuit were continued until nightfall, when the armies bivouacked\r\nupon the ground where the night had overtaken them.\r\n\r\nWhen the move towards Amelia Court House had commenced that morning, I\r\nordered Wright's corps, which was on the extreme right, to be moved to\r\nthe left past the whole army, to take the place of Griffin's, and\r\nordered the latter at the same time to move by and place itself on the\r\nright.  The object of this movement was to get the 6th corps, Wright's,\r\nnext to the cavalry, with which they had formerly served so harmoniously\r\nand so efficiently in the valley of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe 6th corps now remained with the cavalry and under Sheridan's direct\r\ncommand until after the surrender.\r\n\r\nOrd had been directed to take possession of all the roads southward\r\nbetween Burkesville and the High Bridge.  On the morning of the 6th he\r\nsent Colonel Washburn with two infantry regiments with instructions to\r\ndestroy High Bridge and to return rapidly to Burkesville Station; and he\r\nprepared himself to resist the enemy there.  Soon after Washburn had\r\nstarted Ord became a little alarmed as to his safety and sent Colonel\r\nRead, of his staff, with about eighty cavalrymen, to overtake him and\r\nbring him back.  Very shortly after this he heard that the head of Lee's\r\ncolumn had got up to the road between him and where Washburn now was,\r\nand attempted to send reinforcements, but the reinforcements could not\r\nget through.  Read, however, had got through ahead of the enemy.  He\r\nrode on to Farmville and was on his way back again when he found his\r\nreturn cut off, and Washburn confronting apparently the advance of Lee's\r\narmy.  Read drew his men up into line of battle, his force now\r\nconsisting of less than six hundred men, infantry and cavalry, and rode\r\nalong their front, making a speech to his men to inspire them with the\r\nsame enthusiasm that he himself felt.  He then gave the order to charge.\r\nThis little band made several charges, of course unsuccessful ones, but\r\ninflicted a loss upon the enemy more than equal to their own entire\r\nnumber.  Colonel Read fell mortally wounded, and then Washburn; and at\r\nthe close of the conflict nearly every officer of the command and most\r\nof the rank and file had been either killed or wounded.  The remainder\r\nthen surrendered.  The Confederates took this to be only the advance of\r\na larger column which had headed them off, and so stopped to intrench;\r\nso that this gallant band of six hundred had checked the progress of a\r\nstrong detachment of the Confederate army.\r\n\r\nThis stoppage of Lee's column no doubt saved to us the trains following.\r\nLee himself pushed on and crossed the wagon road bridge near the High\r\nBridge, and attempted to destroy it.  He did set fire to it, but the\r\nflames had made but little headway when Humphreys came up with his corps\r\nand drove away the rear-guard which had been left to protect it while it\r\nwas being burned up.  Humphreys forced his way across with some loss,\r\nand followed Lee to the intersection of the road crossing at Farmville\r\nwith the one from Petersburg.  Here Lee held a position which was very\r\nstrong, naturally, besides being intrenched.  Humphreys was alone,\r\nconfronting him all through the day, and in a very hazardous position.\r\nHe put on a bold face, however, and assaulted with some loss, but was\r\nnot assaulted in return.\r\n\r\nOur cavalry had gone farther south by the way of Prince Edward's Court\r\nHouse, along with the 5th corps (Griffin's), Ord falling in between\r\nGriffin and the Appomattox.  Crook's division of cavalry and Wright's\r\ncorps pushed on west of Farmville.  When the cavalry reached Farmville\r\nthey found that some of the Confederates were in ahead of them, and had\r\nalready got their trains of provisions back to that point; but our\r\ntroops were in time to prevent them from securing anything to eat,\r\nalthough they succeeded in again running the trains off, so that we did\r\nnot get them for some time.  These troops retreated to the north side of\r\nthe Appomattox to join Lee, and succeeded in destroying the bridge after\r\nthem.  Considerable fighting ensued there between Wright's corps and a\r\nportion of our cavalry and the Confederates, but finally the cavalry\r\nforded the stream and drove them away.  Wright built a foot-bridge for\r\nhis men to march over on and then marched out to the junction of the\r\nroads to relieve Humphreys, arriving there that night.  I had stopped\r\nthe night before at Burkesville Junction.  Our troops were then pretty\r\nmuch all out of the place, but we had a field hospital there, and Ord's\r\ncommand was extended from that point towards Farmville.\r\n\r\nHere I met Dr. Smith, a Virginian and an officer of the regular army,\r\nwho told me that in a conversation with General Ewell, one of the\r\nprisoners and a relative of his, Ewell had said that when we had got\r\nacross the James River he knew their cause was lost, and it was the duty\r\nof their authorities to make the best terms they could while they still\r\nhad a right to claim concessions. The authorities thought differently,\r\nhowever.  Now the cause was lost and they had no right to claim\r\nanything.  He said further, that for every man that was killed after\r\nthis in the war somebody is responsible, and it would be but very little\r\nbetter than murder.  He was not sure that Lee would consent to surrender\r\nhis army without being able to consult with the President, but he hoped\r\nhe would.\r\n\r\nI rode in to Farmville on the 7th, arriving there early in the day.\r\nSheridan and Ord were pushing through, away to the south.  Meade was\r\nback towards the High Bridge, and Humphreys confronting Lee as before\r\nstated.  After having gone into bivouac at Prince Edward's Court House,\r\nSheridan learned that seven trains of provisions and forage were at\r\nAppomattox, and determined to start at once and capture them; and a\r\nforced march was necessary in order to get there before Lee's army could\r\nsecure them.  He wrote me a note telling me this.  This fact, together\r\nwith the incident related the night before by Dr. Smith, gave me the\r\nidea of opening correspondence with General Lee on the subject of the\r\nsurrender of his army.  I therefore wrote to him on this day, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S., 5 P.M., April 7, 1865.\r\n\r\nGENERAL R. E. LEE Commanding C. S. A.\r\n\r\nThe result of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of\r\nfurther resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia in this\r\nstruggle.  I feel that it is so, and regard it as my duty to shift from\r\nmyself the responsibility of any further effusion of blood, by asking of\r\nyou the surrender of that portion of the Confederate States army known\r\nas the Army of Northern Virginia.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nLee replied on the evening of the same day as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 7, 1865.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:  I have received your note of this day.  Though not\r\nentertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of further\r\nresistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia, I reciprocate\r\nyour desire to avoid useless effusion of blood, and therefore before\r\nconsidering your proposition, ask the terms you will offer on condition\r\nof its surrender.\r\n\r\nR. E. LEE, General.\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GENERAL U. S. GRANT, Commanding Armies of the U. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was not satisfactory, but I regarded it as deserving another letter\r\nand wrote him as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 8, 1865.\r\n\r\nGENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding C. S. A.\r\n\r\nYour note of last evening in reply to mine of same date, asking the\r\ncondition on which I will accept the surrender of the Army of Northern\r\nVirginia is just received.  In reply I would say that, peace being my\r\ngreat desire, there is but one condition I would insist upon, namely:\r\nthat the men and officers surrendered shall be disqualified for taking\r\nup arms again against the Government of the United States until properly\r\nexchanged.  I will meet you, or will designate officers to meet any\r\nofficers you may name for the same purpose, at any point agreeable to\r\nyou, for the purpose of arranging definitely the terms upon which the\r\nsurrender of the Army of Northern Virginia will be received.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nLee's army was rapidly crumbling.  Many of his soldiers had enlisted\r\nfrom that part of the State where they now were, and were continually\r\ndropping out of the ranks and going to their homes.  I know that I\r\noccupied a hotel almost destitute of furniture at Farmville, which had\r\nprobably been used as a Confederate hospital.  The next morning when I\r\ncame out I found a Confederate colonel there, who reported to me and\r\nsaid that he was the proprietor of that house, and that he was a colonel\r\nof a regiment that had been raised in that neighborhood.  He said that\r\nwhen he came along past home, he found that he was the only man of the\r\nregiment remaining with Lee's army, so he just dropped out, and now\r\nwanted to surrender himself.  I told him to stay there and he would not\r\nbe molested.  That was one regiment which had been eliminated from Lee's\r\nforce by this crumbling process.\r\n\r\nAlthough Sheridan had been marching all day, his troops moved with\r\nalacrity and without any straggling.  They began to see the end of what\r\nthey had been fighting four years for.  Nothing seemed to fatigue them.\r\nThey were ready to move without rations and travel without rest until\r\nthe end.  Straggling had entirely ceased, and every man was now a rival\r\nfor the front.  The infantry marched about as rapidly as the cavalry\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nSheridan sent Custer with his division to move south of Appomattox\r\nStation, which is about five miles south-west of the Court House, to get\r\nwest of the trains and destroy the roads to the rear.  They got there\r\nthe night of the 8th, and succeeded partially; but some of the train men\r\nhad just discovered the movement of our troops and succeeded in running\r\noff three of the trains.  The other four were held by Custer.\r\n\r\nThe head of Lee's column came marching up there on the morning of the\r\n9th, not dreaming, I suppose, that there were any Union soldiers near.\r\nThe Confederates were surprised to find our cavalry had possession of\r\nthe trains.  However, they were desperate and at once assaulted, hoping\r\nto recover them.  In the melee that ensued they succeeded in burning one\r\nof the trains, but not in getting anything from it.  Custer then ordered\r\nthe other trains run back on the road towards Farmville, and the fight\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nSo far, only our cavalry and the advance of Lee's army were engaged.\r\nSoon, however, Lee's men were brought up from the rear, no doubt\r\nexpecting they had nothing to meet but our cavalry.  But our infantry\r\nhad pushed forward so rapidly that by the time the enemy got up they\r\nfound Griffin's corps and the Army of the James confronting them.  A\r\nsharp engagement ensued, but Lee quickly set up a white flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nNEGOTIATIONS AT APPOMATTOX--INTERVIEW WITH LEE AT MCLEAN'S HOUSE--THE\r\nTERMS OF SURRENDER--LEE'S SURRENDER--INTERVIEW WITH LEE AFTER THE\r\nSURRENDER.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th I had followed the Army of the Potomac in rear of Lee.  I was\r\nsuffering very severely with a sick headache, and stopped at a farmhouse\r\non the road some distance in rear of the main body of the army.  I spent\r\nthe night in bathing my feet in hot water and mustard, and putting\r\nmustard plasters on my wrists and the back part of my neck, hoping to be\r\ncured by morning. During the night I received Lee's answer to my letter\r\nof the 8th, inviting an interview between the lines on the following\r\nmorning. (*43)  But it was for a different purpose from that of\r\nsurrendering his army, and I answered him as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S., April 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nGENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding C. S. A.\r\n\r\nYour note of yesterday is received.  As I have no authority to treat on\r\nthe subject of peace, the meeting proposed for ten A.M. to-day could\r\nlead to no good.  I will state, however, General, that I am equally\r\nanxious for peace with yourself, and the whole North entertains the same\r\nfeeling.  The terms upon which peace can be had are well understood.  By\r\nthe South laying down their arms they will hasten that most desirable\r\nevent, save thousands of human lives and hundreds of millions of\r\nproperty not yet destroyed.  Sincerely hoping that all our difficulties\r\nmay be settled without the loss of another life, I subscribe myself,\r\netc.,\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI proceeded at an early hour in the morning, still suffering with the\r\nheadache, to get to the head of the column.  I was not more than two or\r\nthree miles from Appomattox Court House at the time, but to go direct I\r\nwould have to pass through Lee's army, or a portion of it.  I had\r\ntherefore to move south in order to get upon a road coming up from\r\nanother direction.\r\n\r\nWhen the white flag was put out by Lee, as already described, I was in\r\nthis way moving towards Appomattox Court House, and consequently could\r\nnot be communicated with immediately, and be informed of what Lee had\r\ndone.  Lee, therefore, sent a flag to the rear to advise Meade and one\r\nto the front to Sheridan, saying that he had sent a message to me for\r\nthe purpose of having a meeting to consult about the surrender of his\r\narmy, and asked for a suspension of hostilities until I could be\r\ncommunicated with.  As they had heard nothing of this until the fighting\r\nhad got to be severe and all going against Lee, both of these commanders\r\nhesitated very considerably about suspending hostilities at all.  They\r\nwere afraid it was not in good faith, and we had the Army of Northern\r\nVirginia where it could not escape except by some deception.  They,\r\nhowever, finally consented to a suspension of hostilities for two hours\r\nto give an opportunity of communicating with me in that time, if\r\npossible.  It was found that, from the route I had taken, they would\r\nprobably not be able to communicate with me and get an answer back\r\nwithin the time fixed unless the messenger should pass through the rebel\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nLee, therefore, sent an escort with the officer bearing this message\r\nthrough his lines to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:  I received your note of this morning on the picket-line\r\nwhither I had come to meet you and ascertain definitely what terms were\r\nembraced in your proposal of yesterday with reference to the surrender\r\nof this army.  I now request an interview in accordance with the offer\r\ncontained in your letter of yesterday for that purpose.\r\n\r\nR. E. LEE, General.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT Commanding U. S. Armies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the officer reached me I was still suffering with the sick\r\nheadache, but the instant I saw the contents of the note I was cured.  I\r\nwrote the following note in reply and hastened on:\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nGENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding C. S. Armies.\r\n\r\nYour note of this date is but this moment (11.50 A.M.) received, in\r\nconsequence of my having passed from the Richmond and Lynchburg road to\r\nthe Farmville and Lynchburg road.  I am at this writing about four miles\r\nwest of Walker's Church and will push forward to the front for the\r\npurpose of meeting you. Notice sent to me on this road where you wish\r\nthe interview to take place will meet me.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was conducted at once to where Sheridan was located with his troops\r\ndrawn up in line of battle facing the Confederate army near by.  They\r\nwere very much excited, and expressed their view that this was all a\r\nruse employed to enable the Confederates to get away.  They said they\r\nbelieved that Johnston was marching up from North Carolina now, and Lee\r\nwas moving to join him; and they would whip the rebels where they now\r\nwere in five minutes if I would only let them go in.  But I had no doubt\r\nabout the good faith of Lee, and pretty soon was conducted to where he\r\nwas.  I found him at the house of a Mr. McLean, at Appomattox Court\r\nHouse, with Colonel Marshall, one of his staff officers, awaiting my\r\narrival.  The head of his column was occupying a hill, on a portion of\r\nwhich was an apple orchard, beyond a little valley which separated it\r\nfrom that on the crest of which Sheridan's forces were drawn up in line\r\nof battle to the south.\r\n\r\nBefore stating what took place between General Lee and myself, I will\r\ngive all there is of the story of the famous apple tree.\r\n\r\nWars produce many stories of fiction, some of which are told until they\r\nare believed to be true.  The war of the rebellion was no exception to\r\nthis rule, and the story of the apple tree is one of those fictions\r\nbased on a slight foundation of fact. As I have said, there was an apple\r\norchard on the side of the hill occupied by the Confederate forces.\r\nRunning diagonally up the hill was a wagon road, which, at one point,\r\nran very near one of the trees, so that the wheels of vehicles had, on\r\nthat side, cut off the roots of this tree, leaving a little embankment.\r\nGeneral Babcock, of my staff, reported to me that when he first met\r\nGeneral Lee he was sitting upon this embankment with his feet in the\r\nroad below and his back resting against the tree.  The story had no\r\nother foundation than that.  Like many other stories, it would be very\r\ngood if it was only true.\r\n\r\nI had known General Lee in the old army, and had served with him in the\r\nMexican War; but did not suppose, owing to the difference in our age and\r\nrank, that he would remember me, while I would more naturally remember\r\nhim distinctly, because he was the chief of staff of General Scott in\r\nthe Mexican War.\r\n\r\nWhen I had left camp that morning I had not expected so soon the result\r\nthat was then taking place, and consequently was in rough garb.  I was\r\nwithout a sword, as I usually was when on horseback on the field, and\r\nwore a soldier's blouse for a coat, with the shoulder straps of my rank\r\nto indicate to the army who I was. When I went into the house I found\r\nGeneral Lee.  We greeted each other, and after shaking hands took our\r\nseats.  I had my staff with me, a good portion of whom were in the room\r\nduring the whole of the interview.\r\n\r\nWhat General Lee's feelings were I do not know.  As he was a man of much\r\ndignity, with an impassible face, it was impossible to say whether he\r\nfelt inwardly glad that the end had finally come, or felt sad over the\r\nresult, and was too manly to show it. Whatever his feelings, they were\r\nentirely concealed from my observation; but my own feelings, which had\r\nbeen quite jubilant on the receipt of his letter, were sad and\r\ndepressed.  I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfall\r\nof a foe who had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so much\r\nfor a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst for\r\nwhich a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least\r\nexcuse.  I do not question, however, the sincerity of the great mass of\r\nthose who were opposed to us.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee was dressed in a full uniform which was entirely new, and\r\nwas wearing a sword of considerable value, very likely the sword which\r\nhad been presented by the State of Virginia; at all events, it was an\r\nentirely different sword from the one that would ordinarily be worn in\r\nthe field.  In my rough traveling suit, the uniform of a private with\r\nthe straps of a lieutenant-general, I must have contrasted very\r\nstrangely with a man so handsomely dressed, six feet high and of\r\nfaultless form. But this was not a matter that I thought of until\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nWe soon fell into a conversation about old army times.  He remarked that\r\nhe remembered me very well in the old army; and I told him that as a\r\nmatter of course I remembered him perfectly, but from the difference in\r\nour rank and years (there being about sixteen years' difference in our\r\nages), I had thought it very likely that I had not attracted his\r\nattention sufficiently to be remembered by him after such a long\r\ninterval.  Our conversation grew so pleasant that I almost forgot the\r\nobject of our meeting.  After the conversation had run on in this style\r\nfor some time, General Lee called my attention to the object of our\r\nmeeting, and said that he had asked for this interview for the purpose\r\nof getting from me the terms I proposed to give his army.  I said that I\r\nmeant merely that his army should lay down their arms, not to take them\r\nup again during the continuance of the war unless duly and properly\r\nexchanged.  He said that he had so understood my letter.\r\n\r\nThen we gradually fell off again into conversation about matters foreign\r\nto the subject which had brought us together.  This continued for some\r\nlittle time, when General Lee again interrupted the course of the\r\nconversation by suggesting that the terms I proposed to give his army\r\nought to be written out. I called to General Parker, secretary on my\r\nstaff, for writing materials, and commenced writing out the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPOMATTOX C. H., VA.,\r\n\r\nAp 19th, 1865.\r\n\r\nGEN. R. E. LEE, Comd'g C. S. A.\r\n\r\nGEN:  In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the 8th\r\ninst., I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of N. Va. on the\r\nfollowing terms, to wit:  Rolls of all the officers and men to be made\r\nin duplicate.  One copy to be given to an officer designated by me, the\r\nother to be retained by such officer or officers as you may designate.\r\nThe officers to give their individual paroles not to take up arms\r\nagainst the Government of the United States until properly exchanged,\r\nand each company or regimental commander sign a like parole for the men\r\nof their commands.  The arms, artillery and public property to be parked\r\nand stacked, and turned over to the officer appointed by me to receive\r\nthem.  This will not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor their\r\nprivate horses or baggage.  This done, each officer and man will be\r\nallowed to return to their homes, not to be disturbed by United States\r\nauthority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in force\r\nwhere they may reside.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, U. S. GRANT, Lt. Gen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I put my pen to the paper I did not know the first word that I\r\nshould make use of in writing the terms.  I only knew what was in my\r\nmind, and I wished to express it clearly, so that there could be no\r\nmistaking it.  As I wrote on, the thought occurred to me that the\r\nofficers had their own private horses and effects, which were important\r\nto them, but of no value to us; also that it would be an unnecessary\r\nhumiliation to call upon them to deliver their side arms.\r\n\r\nNo conversation, not one word, passed between General Lee and myself,\r\neither about private property, side arms, or kindred subjects.  He\r\nappeared to have no objections to the terms first proposed; or if he had\r\na point to make against them he wished to wait until they were in\r\nwriting to make it.  When he read over that part of the terms about side\r\narms, horses and private property of the officers, he remarked, with\r\nsome feeling, I thought, that this would have a happy effect upon his\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nThen, after a little further conversation, General Lee remarked to me\r\nagain that their army was organized a little differently from the army\r\nof the United States (still maintaining by implication that we were two\r\ncountries); that in their army the cavalrymen and artillerists owned\r\ntheir own horses; and he asked if he was to understand that the men who\r\nso owned their horses were to be permitted to retain them.  I told him\r\nthat as the terms were written they would not; that only the officers\r\nwere permitted to take their private property.  He then, after reading\r\nover the terms a second time, remarked that that was clear.\r\n\r\nI then said to him that I thought this would be about the last battle of\r\nthe war--I sincerely hoped so; and I said further I took it that most of\r\nthe men in the ranks were small farmers. The whole country had been so\r\nraided by the two armies that it was doubtful whether they would be able\r\nto put in a crop to carry themselves and their families through the next\r\nwinter without the aid of the horses they were then riding.  The United\r\nStates did not want them and I would, therefore, instruct the officers I\r\nleft behind to receive the paroles of his troops to let every man of the\r\nConfederate army who claimed to own a horse or mule take the animal to\r\nhis home.  Lee remarked again that this would have a happy effect.\r\n\r\nHe then sat down and wrote out the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--I received your letter of this date containing the terms of\r\nthe surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.  As\r\nthey are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the\r\n8th inst., they are accepted.  I will proceed to designate the proper\r\nofficers to carry the stipulations into effect.\r\n\r\nR. E. LEE, General. LIEUT.-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile duplicates of the two letters were being made, the Union generals\r\npresent were severally presented to General Lee.\r\n\r\nThe much talked of surrendering of Lee's sword and my handing it back,\r\nthis and much more that has been said about it is the purest romance.\r\nThe word sword or side arms was not mentioned by either of us until I\r\nwrote it in the terms.  There was no premeditation, and it did not occur\r\nto me until the moment I wrote it down.  If I had happened to omit it,\r\nand General Lee had called my attention to it, I should have put it in\r\nthe terms precisely as I acceded to the provision about the soldiers\r\nretaining their horses.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee, after all was completed and before taking his leave,\r\nremarked that his army was in a very bad condition for want of food, and\r\nthat they were without forage; that his men had been living for some\r\ndays on parched corn exclusively, and that he would have to ask me for\r\nrations and forage.  I told him \"certainly,\" and asked for how many men\r\nhe wanted rations.  His answer was \"about twenty-five thousand;\" and I\r\nauthorized him to send his own commissary and quartermaster to\r\nAppomattox Station, two or three miles away, where he could have, out of\r\nthe trains we had stopped, all the provisions wanted.  As for forage, we\r\nhad ourselves depended almost entirely upon the country for that.\r\n\r\nGenerals Gibbon, Griffin and Merritt were designated by me to carry into\r\neffect the paroling of Lee's troops before they should start for their\r\nhomes--General Lee leaving Generals Longstreet, Gordon and Pendleton for\r\nthem to confer with in order to facilitate this work.  Lee and I then\r\nseparated as cordially as we had met, he returning to his own lines, and\r\nall went into bivouac for the night at Appomattox.\r\n\r\nSoon after Lee's departure I telegraphed to Washington as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS APPOMATTOX C. H., VA., April 9th, 1865, 4.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War, Washington.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia this afternoon on\r\nterms proposed by myself.  The accompanying additional correspondence\r\nwill show the conditions fully.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen news of the surrender first reached our lines our men commenced\r\nfiring a salute of a hundred guns in honor of the victory.  I at once\r\nsent word, however, to have it stopped.  The Confederates were now our\r\nprisoners, and we did not want to exult over their downfall.\r\n\r\nI determined to return to Washington at once, with a view to putting a\r\nstop to the purchase of supplies, and what I now deemed other useless\r\noutlay of money.  Before leaving, however, I thought I (*44) would like\r\nto see General Lee again; so next morning I rode out beyond our lines\r\ntowards his headquarters, preceded by a bugler and a staff-officer\r\ncarrying a white flag.\r\n\r\nLee soon mounted his horse, seeing who it was, and met me.  We had there\r\nbetween the lines, sitting on horseback, a very pleasant conversation of\r\nover half an hour, in the course of which Lee said to me that the South\r\nwas a big country and that we might have to march over it three or four\r\ntimes before the war entirely ended, but that we would now be able to do\r\nit as they could no longer resist us.  He expressed it as his earnest\r\nhope, however, that we would not be called upon to cause more loss and\r\nsacrifice of life; but he could not foretell the result.  I then\r\nsuggested to General Lee that there was not a man in the Confederacy\r\nwhose influence with the soldiery and the whole people was as great as\r\nhis, and that if he would now advise the surrender of all the armies I\r\nhad no doubt his advice would be followed with alacrity.  But Lee said,\r\nthat he could not do that without consulting the President first.  I\r\nknew there was no use to urge him to do anything against his ideas of\r\nwhat was right.\r\n\r\nI was accompanied by my staff and other officers, some of whom seemed to\r\nhave a great desire to go inside the Confederate lines.  They finally\r\nasked permission of Lee to do so for the purpose of seeing some of their\r\nold army friends, and the permission was granted.  They went over, had a\r\nvery pleasant time with their old friends, and brought some of them back\r\nwith them when they returned.\r\n\r\nWhen Lee and I separated he went back to his lines and I returned to the\r\nhouse of Mr. McLean.  Here the officers of both armies came in great\r\nnumbers, and seemed to enjoy the meeting as much as though they had been\r\nfriends separated for a long time while fighting battles under the same\r\nflag.  For the time being it looked very much as if all thought of the\r\nwar had escaped their minds.  After an hour pleasantly passed in this\r\nway I set out on horseback, accompanied by my staff and a small escort,\r\nfor Burkesville Junction, up to which point the railroad had by this\r\ntime been repaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nMORALE OF THE TWO ARMIES--RELATIVE CONDITIONS OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH\r\n--PRESIDENT LINCOLN VISITS RICHMOND--ARRIVAL AT WASHINGTON--PRESIDENT\r\nLINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION--PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S POLICY.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Petersburg, and when the armies of the Potomac and the\r\nJames were in motion to head off Lee's army, the morale of the National\r\ntroops had greatly improved.  There was no more straggling, no more rear\r\nguards.  The men who in former times had been falling back, were now, as\r\nI have already stated, striving to get to the front.  For the first time\r\nin four weary years they felt that they were now nearing the time when\r\nthey could return to their homes with their country saved.  On the other\r\nhand, the Confederates were more than correspondingly depressed.  Their\r\ndespondency increased with each returning day, and especially after the\r\nbattle of Sailor's Creek.  They threw away their arms in constantly\r\nincreasing numbers, dropping out of the ranks and betaking themselves to\r\nthe woods in the hope of reaching their homes.  I have already instanced\r\nthe case of the entire disintegration of a regiment whose colonel I met\r\nat Farmville.  As a result of these and other influences, when Lee\r\nfinally surrendered at Appomattox, there were only 28,356 officers and\r\nmen left to be paroled, and many of these were without arms.  It was\r\nprobably this latter fact which gave rise to the statement sometimes\r\nmade, North and South, that Lee surrendered a smaller number of men than\r\nwhat the official figures show.  As a matter of official record, and in\r\naddition to the number paroled as given above, we captured between March\r\n29th and the date of surrender 19,132 Confederates, to say nothing of\r\nLee's other losses, killed, wounded and missing, during the series of\r\ndesperate conflicts which marked his headlong and determined flight.\r\nThe same record shows the number of cannon, including those at\r\nAppomattox, to have been 689 between the dates named.\r\n\r\nThere has always been a great conflict of opinion as to the number of\r\ntroops engaged in every battle, or all important battles, fought between\r\nthe sections, the South magnifying the number of Union troops engaged\r\nand belittling their own. Northern writers have fallen, in many\r\ninstances, into the same error.  I have often heard gentlemen, who were\r\nthoroughly loyal to the Union, speak of what a splendid fight the South\r\nhad made and successfully continued for four years before yielding, with\r\ntheir twelve million of people against our twenty, and of the twelve\r\nfour being colored slaves, non-combatants.  I will add to their\r\nargument.  We had many regiments of brave and loyal men who volunteered\r\nunder great difficulty from the twelve million belonging to the South.\r\n\r\nBut the South had rebelled against the National government.  It was not\r\nbound by any constitutional restrictions.  The whole South was a\r\nmilitary camp.  The occupation of the colored people was to furnish\r\nsupplies for the army.  Conscription was resorted to early, and embraced\r\nevery male from the age of eighteen to forty-five, excluding only those\r\nphysically unfit to serve in the field, and the necessary number of\r\ncivil officers of State and intended National government.  The old and\r\nphysically disabled furnished a good portion of these.  The slaves, the\r\nnon-combatants, one-third of the whole, were required to work in the\r\nfield without regard to sex, and almost without regard to age.  Children\r\nfrom the age of eight years could and did handle the hoe; they were not\r\nmuch older when they began to hold the plough.  The four million of\r\ncolored non-combatants were equal to more than three times their number\r\nin the North, age for age and sex for sex, in supplying food from the\r\nsoil to support armies.  Women did not work in the fields in the North,\r\nand children attended school.\r\n\r\nThe arts of peace were carried on in the North.  Towns and cities grew\r\nduring the war.  Inventions were made in all kinds of machinery to\r\nincrease the products of a day's labor in the shop, and in the field.\r\nIn the South no opposition was allowed to the government which had been\r\nset up and which would have become real and respected if the rebellion\r\nhad been successful.  No rear had to be protected.  All the troops in\r\nservice could be brought to the front to contest every inch of ground\r\nthreatened with invasion.  The press of the South, like the people who\r\nremained at home, were loyal to the Southern cause.\r\n\r\nIn the North, the country, the towns and the cities presented about the\r\nsame appearance they do in time of peace.  The furnace was in blast, the\r\nshops were filled with workmen, the fields were cultivated, not only to\r\nsupply the population of the North and the troops invading the South,\r\nbut to ship abroad to pay a part of the expense of the war.  In the\r\nNorth the press was free up to the point of open treason.  The citizen\r\ncould entertain his views and express them.  Troops were necessary in\r\nthe Northern States to prevent prisoners from the Southern army being\r\nreleased by outside force, armed and set at large to destroy by fire our\r\nNorthern cities.  Plans were formed by Northern and Southern citizens to\r\nburn our cities, to poison the water supplying them, to spread infection\r\nby importing clothing from infected regions, to blow up our river and\r\nlake steamers--regardless of the destruction of innocent lives.  The\r\ncopperhead disreputable portion of the press magnified rebel successes,\r\nand belittled those of the Union army.  It was, with a large following,\r\nan auxiliary to the Confederate army.  The North would have been much\r\nstronger with a hundred thousand of these men in the Confederate ranks\r\nand the rest of their kind thoroughly subdued, as the Union sentiment\r\nwas in the South, than we were as the battle was fought.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, the whole South was a military camp.  The colored\r\npeople, four million in number, were submissive, and worked in the field\r\nand took care of the families while the able-bodied white men were at\r\nthe front fighting for a cause destined to defeat.  The cause was\r\npopular, and was enthusiastically supported by the young men.  The\r\nconscription took all of them.  Before the war was over, further\r\nconscriptions took those between fourteen and eighteen years of age as\r\njunior reserves, and those between forty-five and sixty as senior\r\nreserves.  It would have been an offence, directly after the war, and\r\nperhaps it would be now, to ask any able-bodied man in the South, who\r\nwas between the ages of fourteen and sixty at any time during the war,\r\nwhether he had been in the Confederate army.  He would assert that he\r\nhad, or account for his absence from the ranks.  Under such\r\ncircumstances it is hard to conceive how the North showed such a\r\nsuperiority of force in every battle fought.  I know they did not.\r\n\r\nDuring 1862 and '3, John H. Morgan, a partisan officer, of no military\r\neducation, but possessed of courage and endurance, operated in the rear\r\nof the Army of the Ohio in Kentucky and Tennessee.  He had no base of\r\nsupplies to protect, but was at home wherever he went.  The army\r\noperating against the South, on the contrary, had to protect its lines\r\nof communication with the North, from which all supplies had to come to\r\nthe front.  Every foot of road had to be guarded by troops stationed at\r\nconvenient distances apart.  These guards could not render assistance\r\nbeyond the points where stationed.  Morgan was foot-loose and could\r\noperate where, his information--always correct--led him to believe he\r\ncould do the greatest damage.  During the time he was operating in this\r\nway he killed, wounded and captured several times the number he ever had\r\nunder his command at any one time.  He destroyed many millions of\r\nproperty in addition. Places he did not attack had to be guarded as if\r\nthreatened by him.  Forrest, an abler soldier, operated farther west,\r\nand held from the National front quite as many men as could be spared\r\nfor offensive operations.  It is safe to say that more than half the\r\nNational army was engaged in guarding lines of supplies, or were on\r\nleave, sick in hospital or on detail which prevented their bearing arms.\r\nThen, again, large forces were employed where no Confederate army\r\nconfronted them.  I deem it safe to say that there were no large\r\nengagements where the National numbers compensated for the advantage of\r\nposition and intrenchment occupied by the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in pursuit of General Lee, the President went to Richmond in\r\ncompany with Admiral Porter, and on board his flagship.  He found the\r\npeople of that city in great consternation.  The leading citizens among\r\nthe people who had remained at home surrounded him, anxious that\r\nsomething should be done to relieve them from suspense.  General Weitzel\r\nwas not then in the city, having taken offices in one of the neighboring\r\nvillages after his troops had succeeded in subduing the conflagration\r\nwhich they had found in progress on entering the Confederate capital.\r\nThe President sent for him, and, on his arrival, a short interview was\r\nhad on board the vessel, Admiral Porter and a leading citizen of\r\nVirginia being also present. After this interview the President wrote an\r\norder in about these words, which I quote from memory:  \"General Weitzel\r\nis authorized to permit the body calling itself the Legislature of\r\nVirginia to meet for the purpose of recalling the Virginia troops from\r\nthe Confederate armies.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately some of the gentlemen composing that body wrote out a call\r\nfor a meeting and had it published in their papers.  This call, however,\r\nwent very much further than Mr. Lincoln had contemplated, as he did not\r\nsay the \"Legislature of Virginia\" but \"the body which called itself the\r\nLegislature of Virginia.\" Mr. Stanton saw the call as published in the\r\nNorthern papers the very next issue and took the liberty of\r\ncountermanding the order authorizing any meeting of the Legislature, or\r\nany other body, and this notwithstanding the fact that the President was\r\nnearer the spot than he was.\r\n\r\nThis was characteristic of Mr. Stanton.  He was a man who never\r\nquestioned his own authority, and who always did in war time what he\r\nwanted to do.  He was an able constitutional lawyer and jurist; but the\r\nConstitution was not an impediment to him while the war lasted.  In this\r\nlatter particular I entirely agree with the view he evidently held.  The\r\nConstitution was not framed with a view to any such rebellion as that of\r\n1861-5.  While it did not authorize rebellion it made no provision\r\nagainst it.  Yet the right to resist or suppress rebellion is as\r\ninherent as the right of self-defence, and as natural as the right of an\r\nindividual to preserve his life when in jeopardy.  The Constitution was\r\ntherefore in abeyance for the time being, so far as it in any way\r\naffected the progress and termination of the war.\r\n\r\nThose in rebellion against the government of the United States were not\r\nrestricted by constitutional provisions, or any other, except the acts\r\nof their Congress, which was loyal and devoted to the cause for which\r\nthe South was then fighting.  It would be a hard case when one-third of\r\na nation, united in rebellion against the national authority, is\r\nentirely untrammeled, that the other two-thirds, in their efforts to\r\nmaintain the Union intact, should be restrained by a Constitution\r\nprepared by our ancestors for the express purpose of insuring the\r\npermanency of the confederation of the States.\r\n\r\nAfter I left General Lee at Appomattox Station, I went with my staff and\r\na few others directly to Burkesville Station on my way to Washington.\r\nThe road from Burkesville back having been newly repaired and the ground\r\nbeing soft, the train got off the track frequently, and, as a result, it\r\nwas after midnight of the second day when I reached City Point.  As soon\r\nas possible I took a dispatch-boat thence to Washington City.\r\n\r\nWhile in Washington I was very busy for a time in preparing the\r\nnecessary orders for the new state of affairs; communicating with my\r\ndifferent commanders of separate departments, bodies of troops, etc.\r\nBut by the 14th I was pretty well through with this work, so as to be\r\nable to visit my children, who were then in Burlington, New Jersey,\r\nattending school.  Mrs. Grant was with me in Washington at the time, and\r\nwe were invited by President and Mrs. Lincoln to accompany them to the\r\ntheatre on the evening of that day.  I replied to the President's verbal\r\ninvitation to the effect, that if we were in the city we would take\r\ngreat pleasure in accompanying them; but that I was very anxious to get\r\naway and visit my children, and if I could get through my work during\r\nthe day I should do so.  I did get through and started by the evening\r\ntrain on the 14th, sending Mr. Lincoln word, of course, that I would not\r\nbe at the theatre.\r\n\r\nAt that time the railroad to New York entered Philadelphia on Broad\r\nStreet; passengers were conveyed in ambulances to the Delaware River,\r\nand then ferried to Camden, at which point they took the cars again.\r\nWhen I reached the ferry, on the east side of the City of Philadelphia,\r\nI found people awaiting my arrival there; and also dispatches informing\r\nme of the assassination of the President and Mr. Seward, and of the\r\nprobable assassination of the Vice President, Mr. Johnson, and\r\nrequesting my immediate return.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible for me to describe the feeling that overcame me\r\nat the news of these assassinations, more especially the assassination\r\nof the President.  I knew his goodness of heart, his generosity, his\r\nyielding disposition, his desire to have everybody happy, and above all\r\nhis desire to see all the people of the United States enter again upon\r\nthe full privileges of citizenship with equality among all.  I knew also\r\nthe feeling that Mr. Johnson had expressed in speeches and conversation\r\nagainst the Southern people, and I feared that his course towards them\r\nwould be such as to repel, and make them unwilling citizens; and if they\r\nbecame such they would remain so for a long while.  I felt that\r\nreconstruction had been set back, no telling how far.\r\n\r\nI immediately arranged for getting a train to take me back to Washington\r\nCity; but Mrs. Grant was with me; it was after midnight and Burlington\r\nwas but an hour away.  Finding that I could accompany her to our house\r\nand return about as soon as they would be ready to take me from the\r\nPhiladelphia station, I went up with her and returned immediately by the\r\nsame special train.  The joy that I had witnessed among the people in\r\nthe street and in public places in Washington when I left there, had\r\nbeen turned to grief; the city was in reality a city of mourning.  I\r\nhave stated what I believed then the effect of this would be, and my\r\njudgment now is that I was right.  I believe the South would have been\r\nsaved from very much of the hardness of feeling that was engendered by\r\nMr. Johnson's course towards them during the first few months of his\r\nadministration.  Be this as it may, Mr. Lincoln's assassination was\r\nparticularly unfortunate for the entire nation.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson's course towards the South did engender bitterness of\r\nfeeling.  His denunciations of treason and his ever-ready remark,\r\n\"Treason is a crime and must be made odious,\" was repeated to all those\r\nmen of the South who came to him to get some assurances of safety so\r\nthat they might go to work at something with the feeling that what they\r\nobtained would be secure to them.  He uttered his denunciations with\r\ngreat vehemence, and as they were accompanied with no assurances of\r\nsafety, many Southerners were driven to a point almost beyond endurance.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States is, in a large degree, or ought to\r\nbe, a representative of the feeling, wishes and judgment of those over\r\nwhom he presides; and the Southerners who read the denunciations of\r\nthemselves and their people must have come to the conclusion that he\r\nuttered the sentiments of the Northern people; whereas, as a matter of\r\nfact, but for the assassination of Mr. Lincoln, I believe the great\r\nmajority of the Northern people, and the soldiers unanimously, would\r\nhave been in favor of a speedy reconstruction on terms that would be the\r\nleast humiliating to the people who had rebelled against their\r\ngovernment.  They believed, I have no doubt, as I did, that besides\r\nbeing the mildest, it was also the wisest, policy.\r\n\r\nThe people who had been in rebellion must necessarily come back into the\r\nUnion, and be incorporated as an integral part of the nation.  Naturally\r\nthe nearer they were placed to an equality with the people who had not\r\nrebelled, the more reconciled they would feel with their old\r\nantagonists, and the better citizens they would be from the beginning.\r\nThey surely would not make good citizens if they felt that they had a\r\nyoke around their necks.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the majority of the Northern people at that time\r\nwere in favor of negro suffrage.  They supposed that it would naturally\r\nfollow the freedom of the negro, but that there would be a time of\r\nprobation, in which the ex-slaves could prepare themselves for the\r\nprivileges of citizenship before the full right would be conferred; but\r\nMr. Johnson, after a complete revolution of sentiment, seemed to regard\r\nthe South not only as an oppressed people, but as the people best\r\nentitled to consideration of any of our citizens.  This was more than\r\nthe people who had secured to us the perpetuation of the Union were\r\nprepared for, and they became more radical in their views.  The\r\nSoutherners had the most power in the executive branch, Mr. Johnson\r\nhaving gone to their side; and with a compact South, and such sympathy\r\nand support as they could get from the North, they felt that they would\r\nbe able to control the nation at once, and already many of them acted as\r\nif they thought they were entitled to do so.\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Johnson, fighting Congress on the one hand, and receiving the\r\nsupport of the South on the other, drove Congress, which was\r\noverwhelmingly republican, to the passing of first one measure and then\r\nanother to restrict his power.  There being a solid South on one side\r\nthat was in accord with the political party in the North which had\r\nsympathized with the rebellion, it finally, in the judgment of Congress\r\nand of the majority of the legislatures of the States, became necessary\r\nto enfranchise the negro, in all his ignorance.  In this work, I shall\r\nnot discuss the question of how far the policy of Congress in this\r\nparticular proved a wise one.  It became an absolute necessity, however,\r\nbecause of the foolhardiness of the President and the blindness of the\r\nSouthern people to their own interest.  As to myself, while strongly\r\nfavoring the course that would be the least humiliating to the people\r\nwho had been in rebellion, I gradually worked up to the point where,\r\nwith the majority of the people, I favored immediate enfranchisement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nSHERMAN AND JOHNSTON--JOHNSTON'S SURRENDER TO SHERMAN--CAPTURE OF\r\nMOBILE--WILSON'S EXPEDITION--CAPTURE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS--GENERAL\r\nTHOMAS'S QUALITIES--ESTIMATE OF GENERAL CANBY.\r\n\r\nWhen I left Appomattox I ordered General Meade to proceed leisurely back\r\nto Burkesville Station with the Army of the Potomac and the Army of the\r\nJames, and to go into camp there until further orders from me.  General\r\nJohnston, as has been stated before, was in North Carolina confronting\r\nGeneral Sherman.  It could not be known positively, of course, whether\r\nJohnston would surrender on the news of Lee's surrender, though I\r\nsupposed he would; and if he did not, Burkesville Station was the\r\nnatural point from which to move to attack him.  The army which I could\r\nhave sent against him was superior to his, and that with which Sherman\r\nconfronted him was also superior; and between the two he would\r\nnecessarily have been crushed, or driven away.  With the loss of their\r\ncapital and the Army of Northern Virginia it was doubtful whether\r\nJohnston's men would have the spirit to stand.  My belief was that he\r\nwould make no such attempt; but I adopted this course as a precaution\r\nagainst what might happen, however improbable.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with my starting from City Point, I sent a messenger to\r\nNorth Carolina by boat with dispatches to General Sherman, informing him\r\nof the surrender of Lee and his army; also of the terms which I had\r\ngiven him; and I authorized Sherman to give the same terms to Johnston\r\nif the latter chose to accept them.  The country is familiar with the\r\nterms that Sherman agreed to CONDITIONALLY, because they embraced a\r\npolitical question as well as a military one and he would therefore have\r\nto confer with the government before agreeing to them definitely.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman had met Mr. Lincoln at City Point while visiting there\r\nto confer with me about our final movement, and knew what Mr. Lincoln\r\nhad said to the peace commissioners when he met them at Hampton Roads,\r\nviz.:  that before he could enter into negotiations with them they would\r\nhave to agree to two points: one being that the Union should be\r\npreserved, and the other that slavery should be abolished; and if they\r\nwere ready to concede these two points he was almost ready to sign his\r\nname to a blank piece of paper and permit them to fill out the balance\r\nof the terms upon which we would live together.  He had also seen\r\nnotices in the newspapers of Mr. Lincoln's visit to Richmond, and had\r\nread in the same papers that while there he had authorized the convening\r\nof the Legislature of Virginia.\r\n\r\nSherman thought, no doubt, in adding to the terms that I had made with\r\ngeneral Lee, that he was but carrying out the wishes of the President of\r\nthe United States.  But seeing that he was going beyond his authority,\r\nhe made it a point that the terms were only conditional.  They signed\r\nthem with this understanding, and agreed to a truce until the terms\r\ncould be sent to Washington for approval; if approved by the proper\r\nauthorities there, they would then be final; if not approved, then he\r\nwould give due notice, before resuming hostilities.  As the world knows,\r\nSherman, from being one of the most popular generals of the land\r\n(Congress having even gone so far as to propose a bill providing for a\r\nsecond lieutenant-general for the purpose of advancing him to that\r\ngrade), was denounced by the President and Secretary of War in very\r\nbitter terms.  Some people went so far as to denounce him as a traitor\r\n--a most preposterous term to apply to a man who had rendered so much\r\nservice as he had, even supposing he had made a mistake in granting such\r\nterms as he did to Johnston and his army.  If Sherman had taken\r\nauthority to send Johnston with his army home, with their arms to be put\r\nin the arsenals of their own States, without submitting the question to\r\nthe authorities at Washington, the suspicions against him might have\r\nsome foundation.  But the feeling against Sherman died out very rapidly,\r\nand it was not many weeks before he was restored to the fullest\r\nconfidence of the American people.\r\n\r\nWhen, some days after my return to Washington, President Johnson and the\r\nSecretary of war received the terms which General Sherman had forwarded\r\nfor approval, a cabinet meeting was immediately called and I was sent\r\nfor.  There seemed to be the greatest consternation, lest Sherman would\r\ncommit the government to terms which they were not willing to accede to\r\nand which he had no right to grant.  A message went out directing the\r\ntroops in the South not to obey General Sherman.  I was ordered to\r\nproceed at once to North Carolina and take charge of matter there\r\nmyself. Of course I started without delay, and reached there as soon as\r\npossible.  I repaired to Raleigh, where Sherman was, as quietly as\r\npossible, hoping to see him without even his army learning of my\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived I went to Sherman's headquarters, and we were at once\r\ncloseted together.  I showed him the instruction and orders under which\r\nI visited him.  I told him that I wanted him to notify General Johnston\r\nthat the terms which they had conditionally agreed upon had not been\r\napproved in Washington, and that he was authorized to offer the same\r\nterms I had given General Lee.  I sent Sherman to do this himself.  I\r\ndid not wish the knowledge of my presence to be known to the army\r\ngenerally; so I left it to Sherman to negotiate the terms of the\r\nsurrender solely by himself, and without the enemy knowing that I was\r\nanywhere near the field.  As soon as possible I started to get away, to\r\nleave Sherman quite free and untrammelled.\r\n\r\nAt Goldsboro', on my way back, I met a mail, containing the last\r\nnewspapers, and I found in them indications of great excitement in the\r\nNorth over the terms Sherman had given Johnston; and harsh orders that\r\nhad been promulgated by the President and Secretary of War.  I knew that\r\nSherman must see these papers, and I fully realized what great\r\nindignation they would cause him, though I do not think his feelings\r\ncould have been more excited than were my own.  But like the true and\r\nloyal soldier that he was, he carried out the instructions I had given\r\nhim, obtained the surrender of Johnston's army, and settled down in his\r\ncamp about Raleigh, to await final orders.\r\n\r\nThere were still a few expeditions out in the South that could not be\r\ncommunicated with, and had to be left to act according to the judgment\r\nof their respective commanders.  With these it was impossible to tell\r\nhow the news of the surrender of Lee and Johnston, of which they must\r\nhave heard, might affect their judgment as to what was best to do.\r\n\r\nThe three expeditions which I had tried so hard to get off from the\r\ncommands of Thomas and Canby did finally get off:  one under Canby\r\nhimself, against Mobile, late in March; that under Stoneman from East\r\nTennessee on the 20th; and the one under Wilson, starting from Eastport,\r\nMississippi, on the 22d of March.  They were all eminently successful,\r\nbut without any good result. Indeed much valuable property was destroyed\r\nand many lives lost at a time when we would have liked to spare them.\r\nThe war was practically over before their victories were gained.  They\r\nwere so late in commencing operations, that they did not hold any troops\r\naway that otherwise would have been operating against the armies which\r\nwere gradually forcing the Confederate armies to a surrender.  The only\r\npossible good that we may have experienced from these raids was by\r\nStoneman's getting near Lynchburg about the time the armies of the\r\nPotomac and the James were closing in on Lee at Appomattox.\r\n\r\nStoneman entered North Carolina and then pushed north to strike the\r\nVirginia and Tennessee Railroad.  He got upon that road, destroyed its\r\nbridges at different places and rendered the road useless to the enemy\r\nup to within a few miles of Lynchburg.  His approach caused the\r\nevacuation of that city about the time we were at Appomattox, and was\r\nthe cause of a commotion we heard of there.  He then pushed south, and\r\nwas operating in the rear of Johnston's army about the time the\r\nnegotiations were going on between Sherman and Johnston for the latter's\r\nsurrender.  In this raid Stoneman captured and destroyed a large amount\r\nof stores, while fourteen guns and nearly two thousand prisoners were\r\nthe trophies of his success.\r\n\r\nCanby appeared before Mobile on the 27th of March.  The city of Mobile\r\nwas protected by two forts, besides other intrenchments--Spanish Fort,\r\non the east side of the bay, and Fort Blakely, north of the city.  These\r\nforts were invested.  On the night of the 8th of April, the National\r\ntroops having carried the enemy's works at one point, Spanish Fort was\r\nevacuated; and on the 9th, the very day of Lee's surrender, Blakely was\r\ncarried by assault, with a considerable loss to us.  On the 11th the\r\ncity was evacuated.\r\n\r\nI had tried for more than two years to have an expedition sent against\r\nMobile when its possession by us would have been of great advantage.  It\r\nfinally cost lives to take it when its possession was of no importance,\r\nand when, if left alone, it would within a few days have fallen into our\r\nhands without any bloodshed whatever.\r\n\r\nWilson moved out with full 12,000 men, well equipped and well armed.  He\r\nwas an energetic officer and accomplished his work rapidly.  Forrest was\r\nin his front, but with neither his old-time army nor his old-time\r\nprestige.  He now had principally conscripts.  His conscripts were\r\ngenerally old men and boys.  He had a few thousand regular cavalry left,\r\nbut not enough to even retard materially the progress of Wilson's\r\ncavalry.  Selma fell on the 2d of April, with a large number of\r\nprisoners and a large quantity of war material, machine shops, etc., to\r\nbe disposed of by the victors.  Tuscaloosa, Montgomery and West Point\r\nfell in quick succession.  These were all important points to the enemy\r\nby reason of their railroad connections, as depots of supplies, and\r\nbecause of their manufactories of war material.  They were fortified or\r\nintrenched, and there was considerable fighting before they were\r\ncaptured.  Macon surrendered on the 21st of April.  Here news was\r\nreceived of the negotiations for the surrender of Johnston's army.\r\nWilson belonged to the military division commanded by Sherman, and of\r\ncourse was bound by his terms.  This stopped all fighting.\r\n\r\nGeneral Richard Taylor had now become the senior Confederate officer\r\nstill at liberty east of the Mississippi River, and on the 4th of May he\r\nsurrendered everything within the limits of this extensive command.\r\nGeneral E. Kirby Smith surrendered the trans-Mississippi department on\r\nthe 26th of May, leaving no other Confederate army at liberty to\r\ncontinue the war.\r\n\r\nWilson's raid resulted in the capture of the fugitive president of the\r\ndefunct confederacy before he got out of the country. This occurred at\r\nIrwinsville, Georgia, on the 11th of May.  For myself, and I believe Mr.\r\nLincoln shared the feeling, I would have been very glad to have seen Mr.\r\nDavis succeed in escaping, but for one reason:  I feared that if not\r\ncaptured, he might get into the trans-Mississippi region and there set\r\nup a more contracted confederacy.  The young men now out of homes and\r\nout of employment might have rallied under his standard and protracted\r\nthe war yet another year.  The Northern people were tired of the war,\r\nthey were tired of piling up a debt which would be a further mortgage\r\nupon their homes.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, I believe, wanted Mr. Davis to escape, because he did not\r\nwish to deal with the matter of his punishment.  He knew there would be\r\npeople clamoring for the punishment of the ex-Confederate president, for\r\nhigh treason.  He thought blood enough had already been spilled to atone\r\nfor our wickedness as a nation.  At all events he did not wish to be the\r\njudge to decide whether more should be shed or not.  But his own life\r\nwas sacrificed at the hands of an assassin before the ex-president of\r\nthe Confederacy was a prisoner in the hands of the government which he\r\nhad lent all his talent and all his energies to destroy.\r\n\r\nAll things are said to be wisely directed, and for the best interest of\r\nall concerned.  This reflection does not, however, abate in the\r\nslightest our sense of bereavement in the untimely loss of so good and\r\ngreat a man as Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nHe would have proven the best friend the South could have had, and saved\r\nmuch of the wrangling and bitterness of feeling brought out by\r\nreconstruction under a President who at first wished to revenge himself\r\nupon Southern men of better social standing than himself, but who still\r\nsought their recognition, and in a short time conceived the idea and\r\nadvanced the proposition to become their Moses to lead them triumphantly\r\nout of all their difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe story of the legislation enacted during the reconstruction period to\r\nstay the hands of the President is too fresh in the minds of the people\r\nto be told now.  Much of it, no doubt, was unconstitutional; but it was\r\nhoped that the laws enacted would serve their purpose before the\r\nquestion of constitutionality could be submitted to the judiciary and a\r\ndecision obtained. These laws did serve their purpose, and now remain \"a\r\ndead letter\" upon the statute books of the United States, no one taking\r\ninterest enough in them to give them a passing thought.\r\n\r\nMuch was said at the time about the garb Mr. Davis was wearing when he\r\nwas captured.  I cannot settle this question from personal knowledge of\r\nthe facts; but I have been under the belief, from information given to\r\nme by General Wilson shortly after the event, that when Mr. Davis\r\nlearned that he was surrounded by our cavalry he was in his tent dressed\r\nin a gentleman's dressing gown.  Naturally enough, Mr. Davis wanted to\r\nescape, and would not reflect much how this should be accomplished\r\nprovided it might be done successfully.  If captured, he would be no\r\nordinary prisoner.  He represented all there was of that hostility to\r\nthe government which had caused four years of the bloodiest war--and the\r\nmost costly in other respects of which history makes any record.  Every\r\none supposed he would be tried for treason if captured, and that he\r\nwould be executed.  Had he succeeded in making his escape in any\r\ndisguise it would have been adjudged a good thing afterwards by his\r\nadmirers.\r\n\r\nAs my official letters on file in the War Department, as well as my\r\nremarks in this book, reflect upon General Thomas by dwelling somewhat\r\nupon his tardiness, it is due to myself, as well as to him, that I give\r\nmy estimate of him as a soldier.  The same remark will apply also in the\r\ncase of General Canby.  I had been at West Point with Thomas one year,\r\nand had known him later in the old army.  He was a man of commanding\r\nappearance, slow and deliberate in speech and action; sensible, honest\r\nand brave.  He possessed valuable soldierly qualities in an eminent\r\ndegree.  He gained the confidence of all who served under him, and\r\nalmost their love.  This implies a very valuable quality.  It is a\r\nquality which calls out the most efficient services of the troops\r\nserving under the commander possessing it.\r\n\r\nThomas's dispositions were deliberately made, and always good. He could\r\nnot be driven from a point he was given to hold.  He was not as good,\r\nhowever, in pursuit as he was in action.  I do not believe that he could\r\never have conducted Sherman's army from Chattanooga to Atlanta against\r\nthe defences and the commander guarding that line in 1864.  On the other\r\nhand, if it had been given him to hold the line which Johnston tried to\r\nhold, neither that general nor Sherman, nor any other officer could have\r\ndone it better.\r\n\r\nThomas was a valuable officer, who richly deserved, as he has received,\r\nthe plaudits of his countrymen for the part he played in the great\r\ntragedy of 1861-5.\r\n\r\nGeneral Canby was an officer of great merit.  He was naturally studious,\r\nand inclined to the law.  There have been in the army but very few, if\r\nany, officers who took as much interest in reading and digesting every\r\nact of Congress and every regulation for the government of the army as\r\nhe.  His knowledge gained in this way made him a most valuable staff\r\nofficer, a capacity in which almost all his army services were rendered\r\nup to the time of his being assigned to the Military Division of the\r\nGulf.  He was an exceedingly modest officer, though of great talent and\r\nlearning.  I presume his feelings when first called upon to command a\r\nlarge army against a fortified city, were somewhat like my own when\r\nmarching a regiment against General Thomas Harris in Missouri in 1861.\r\nNeither of us would have felt the slightest trepidation in going into\r\nbattle with some one else commanding.  Had Canby been in other\r\nengagements afterwards, he would, I have no doubt, have advanced without\r\nany fear arising from a sense of the responsibility.  He was afterwards\r\nkilled in the lava beds of Southern Oregon, while in pursuit of the\r\nhostile Modoc Indians.  His character was as pure as his talent and\r\nlearning were great.  His services were valuable during the war, but\r\nprincipally as a bureau officer.  I have no idea that it was from choice\r\nthat his services were rendered in an office, but because of his\r\nsuperior efficiency there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE WAR--THE MARCH TO WASHINGTON--ONE OF LINCOLN'S ANECDOTES\r\n--GRAND REVIEW AT WASHINGTON--CHARACTERISTICS OF LINCOLN AND STANTON\r\n--ESTIMATE OF THE DIFFERENT CORPS COMMANDERS.\r\n\r\nThings began to quiet down, and as the certainty that there would be no\r\nmore armed resistance became clearer, the troops in North Carolina and\r\nVirginia were ordered to march immediately to the capital, and go into\r\ncamp there until mustered out.  Suitable garrisons were left at the\r\nprominent places throughout the South to insure obedience to the laws\r\nthat might be enacted for the government of the several States, and to\r\ninsure security to the lives and property of all classes.  I do not know\r\nhow far this was necessary, but I deemed it necessary, at that time,\r\nthat such a course should be pursued.  I think now that these garrisons\r\nwere continued after they ceased to be absolutely required; but it is\r\nnot to be expected that such a rebellion as was fought between the\r\nsections from 1861 to 1865 could terminate without leaving many serious\r\napprehensions in the mind of the people as to what should be done.\r\n\r\nSherman marched his troops from Goldsboro, up to Manchester, on the\r\nsouth side of the James River, opposite Richmond, and there put them in\r\ncamp, while he went back to Savannah to see what the situation was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIt was during this trip that the last outrage was committed upon him.\r\nHalleck had been sent to Richmond to command Virginia, and had issued\r\norders prohibiting even Sherman's own troops from obeying his,\r\nSherman's, orders.  Sherman met the papers on his return, containing\r\nthis order of Halleck, and very justly felt indignant at the outrage.\r\nOn his arrival at Fortress Monroe returning from Savannah, Sherman\r\nreceived an invitation from Halleck to come to Richmond and be his\r\nguest.  This he indignantly refused, and informed Halleck, furthermore,\r\nthat he had seen his order.  He also stated that he was coming up to\r\ntake command of his troops, and as he marched through it would probably\r\nbe as well for Halleck not to show himself, because he (Sherman) would\r\nnot be responsible for what some rash person might do through\r\nindignation for the treatment he had received.  Very soon after that,\r\nSherman received orders from me to proceed to Washington City, and to go\r\ninto camp on the south side of the city pending the mustering-out of the\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nThere was no incident worth noting in the march northward from\r\nGoldsboro, to Richmond, or in that from Richmond to Washington City.\r\nThe army, however, commanded by Sherman, which had been engaged in all\r\nthe battles of the West and had marched from the Mississippi through the\r\nSouthern States to the sea, from there to Goldsboro, and thence to\r\nWashington City, had passed over many of the battle-fields of the Army\r\nof the Potomac, thus having seen, to a greater extent than any other\r\nbody of troops, the entire theatre of the four years' war for the\r\npreservation of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe march of Sherman's army from Atlanta to the sea and north to\r\nGoldsboro, while it was not accompanied with the danger that was\r\nanticipated, yet was magnificent in its results, and equally magnificent\r\nin the way it was conducted.  It had an important bearing, in various\r\nways, upon the great object we had in view, that of closing the war.\r\nAll the States east of the Mississippi River up to the State of Georgia,\r\nhad felt the hardships of the war.  Georgia, and South Carolina, and\r\nalmost all of North Carolina, up to this time, had been exempt from\r\ninvasion by the Northern armies, except upon their immediate sea coasts.\r\nTheir newspapers had given such an account of Confederate success, that\r\nthe people who remained at home had been convinced that the Yankees had\r\nbeen whipped from first to last, and driven from pillar to post, and\r\nthat now they could hardly be holding out for any other purpose than to\r\nfind a way out of the war with honor to themselves.\r\n\r\nEven during this march of Sherman's the newspapers in his front were\r\nproclaiming daily that his army was nothing better than a mob of men who\r\nwere frightened out of their wits and hastening, panic-stricken, to try\r\nto get under the cover of our navy for protection against the Southern\r\npeople.  As the army was seen marching on triumphantly, however, the\r\nminds of the people became disabused and they saw the true state of\r\naffairs.  In turn they became disheartened, and would have been glad to\r\nsubmit without compromise.\r\n\r\nAnother great advantage resulting from this march, and which was\r\ncalculated to hasten the end, was the fact that the great storehouse of\r\nGeorgia was entirely cut off from the Confederate armies.  As the troops\r\nadvanced north from Savannah, the destruction of the railroads in South\r\nCarolina and the southern part of North Carolina, further cut off their\r\nresources and left the armies still in Virginia and North Carolina\r\ndependent for supplies upon a very small area of country, already very\r\nmuch exhausted of food and forage.\r\n\r\nIn due time the two armies, one from Burkesville Junction and the other\r\nfrom the neighborhood of Raleigh, North Carolina, arrived and went into\r\ncamp near the Capital, as directed.  The troops were hardy, being inured\r\nto fatigue, and they appeared in their respective camps as ready and fit\r\nfor duty as they had ever been in their lives.  I doubt whether an equal\r\nbody of men of any nation, take them man for man, officer for officer,\r\nwas ever gotten together that would have proved their equal in a great\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThe armies of Europe are machines; the men are brave and the officers\r\ncapable; but the majority of the soldiers in most of the nations of\r\nEurope are taken from a class of people who are not very intelligent and\r\nwho have very little interest in the contest in which they are called\r\nupon to take part.  Our armies were composed of men who were able to\r\nread, men who knew what they were fighting for, and could not be induced\r\nto serve as soldiers, except in an emergency when the safety of the\r\nnation was involved, and so necessarily must have been more than equal\r\nto men who fought merely because they were brave and because they were\r\nthoroughly drilled and inured to hardships.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing of particular importance occurred during the time\r\nthese troops were in camp before starting North.\r\n\r\nI remember one little incident which I will relate as an anecdote\r\ncharacteristic of Mr. Lincoln.  It occurred a day after I reached\r\nWashington, and about the time General Meade reached Burkesville with\r\nthe army.  Governor Smith of Virginia had left Richmond with the\r\nConfederate States government, and had gone to Danville.  Supposing I\r\nwas necessarily with the army at Burkesville, he addressed a letter to\r\nme there informing me that, as governor of the Commonwealth of the State\r\nof Virginia, he had temporarily removed the State capital from Richmond\r\nto Danville, and asking if he would be permitted to perform the\r\nfunctions of his office there without molestation by the Federal\r\nauthorities.  I give this letter only in substance.  He also inquired of\r\nme whether in case he was not allowed to perform the duties of his\r\noffice, he with a few others might not be permitted to leave the country\r\nand go abroad without interference.  General Meade being informed that a\r\nflag of truce was outside his pickets with a letter to me, at once sent\r\nout and had the letter brought in without informing the officer who\r\nbrought it that I was not present.  He read the letter and telegraphed\r\nme its contents. Meeting Mr. Lincoln shortly after receiving this\r\ndispatch, I repeated its contents to him.  Mr. Lincoln, supposing I was\r\nasking for instructions, said, in reply to that part of Governor Smith's\r\nletter which inquired whether he with a few friends would be permitted\r\nto leave the country unmolested, that his position was like that of a\r\ncertain Irishman (giving the name) he knew in Springfield who was very\r\npopular with the people, a man of considerable promise, and very much\r\nliked.  Unfortunately he had acquired the habit of drinking, and his\r\nfriends could see that the habit was growing on him.  These friends\r\ndetermined to make an effort to save him, and to do this they drew up a\r\npledge to abstain from all alcoholic drinks.  They asked Pat to join\r\nthem in signing the pledge, and he consented.  He had been so long out\r\nof the habit of using plain water as a beverage that he resorted to\r\nsoda-water as a substitute.  After a few days this began to grow\r\ndistasteful to him.  So holding the glass behind him, he said:  \"Doctor,\r\ncouldn't you drop a bit of brandy in that unbeknownst to myself.\"\r\n\r\nI do not remember what the instructions were the President gave me, but\r\nI know that Governor Smith was not permitted to perform the duties of\r\nhis office.  I also know that if Mr. Lincoln had been spared, there\r\nwould have been no efforts made to prevent any one from leaving the\r\ncountry who desired to do so.  He would have been equally willing to\r\npermit the return of the same expatriated citizens after they had time\r\nto repent of their choice.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of May orders were issued by the adjutant-general for a\r\ngrand review by the President and his cabinet of Sherman's and Meade's\r\narmies.  The review commenced on the 23d and lasted two days.  Meade's\r\narmy occupied over six hours of the first day in passing the grand stand\r\nwhich had been erected in front of the President's house.  Sherman\r\nwitnessed this review from the grand stand which was occupied by the\r\nPresident and his cabinet.  Here he showed his resentment for the cruel\r\nand harsh treatment that had unnecessarily been inflicted upon him by\r\nthe Secretary of War, by refusing to take his extended hand.\r\n\r\nSherman's troops had been in camp on the south side of the Potomac.\r\nDuring the night of the 23d he crossed over and bivouacked not far from\r\nthe Capitol.  Promptly at ten o'clock on the morning of the 24th, his\r\ntroops commenced to pass in review.  Sherman's army made a different\r\nappearance from that of the Army of the Potomac.  The latter had been\r\noperating where they received directly from the North full supplies of\r\nfood and clothing regularly:  the review of this army therefore was the\r\nreview of a body of 65,000 well-drilled, well-disciplined and orderly\r\nsoldiers inured to hardship and fit for any duty, but without the\r\nexperience of gathering their own food and supplies in an enemy's\r\ncountry, and of being ever on the watch. Sherman's army was not so\r\nwell-dressed as the Army of the Potomac, but their marching could not\r\nbe excelled; they gave the appearance of men who had been thoroughly\r\ndrilled to endure hardships, either by long and continuous marches or\r\nthrough exposure to any climate, without the ordinary shelter of a camp.\r\nThey exhibited also some of the order of march through Georgia where the\r\n\"sweet potatoes sprung up from the ground\" as Sherman's army went\r\nmarching through.  In the rear of a company there would be a captured\r\nhorse or mule loaded with small cooking utensils, captured chickens and\r\nother food picked up for the use of the men.  Negro families who had\r\nfollowed the army would sometimes come along in the rear of a company,\r\nwith three or four children packed upon a single mule, and the mother\r\nleading it.\r\n\r\nThe sight was varied and grand:  nearly all day for two successive days,\r\nfrom the Capitol to the Treasury Building, could be seen a mass of\r\norderly soldiers marching in columns of companies.  The National flag\r\nwas flying from almost every house and store; the windows were filled\r\nwith spectators; the door-steps and side-walks were crowded with colored\r\npeople and poor whites who did not succeed in securing better quarters\r\nfrom which to get a view of the grand armies.  The city was about as\r\nfull of strangers who had come to see the sights as it usually is on\r\ninauguration day when a new President takes his seat.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to again allude to President Lincoln and the\r\nSecretary of War, Mr. Stanton, who were the great conspicuous figures in\r\nthe executive branch of the government. There is no great difference of\r\nopinion now, in the public mind, as to the characteristics of the\r\nPresident.  With Mr. Stanton the case is different.  They were the very\r\nopposite of each other in almost every particular, except that each\r\npossessed great ability.  Mr. Lincoln gained influence over men by\r\nmaking them feel that it was a pleasure to serve him.  He preferred\r\nyielding his own wish to gratify others, rather than to insist upon\r\nhaving his own way.  It distressed him to disappoint others.  In matters\r\nof public duty, however, he had what he wished, but in the least\r\noffensive way.  Mr. Stanton never questioned his own authority to\r\ncommand, unless resisted.  He cared nothing for the feeling of others.\r\nIn fact it seemed to be pleasanter to him to disappoint than to gratify.\r\nHe felt no hesitation in assuming the functions of the executive, or in\r\nacting without advising with him.  If his act was not sustained, he\r\nwould change it--if he saw the matter would be followed up until he did\r\nso.\r\n\r\nIt was generally supposed that these two officials formed the complement\r\nof each other.  The Secretary was required to prevent the President's\r\nbeing imposed upon.  The President was required in the more responsible\r\nplace of seeing that injustice was not done to others.  I do not know\r\nthat this view of these two men is still entertained by the majority of\r\nthe people.  It is not a correct view, however, in my estimation.  Mr.\r\nLincoln did not require a guardian to aid him in the fulfilment of a\r\npublic trust.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was not timid, and he was willing to trust his generals in\r\nmaking and executing their plans.  The Secretary was very timid, and it\r\nwas impossible for him to avoid interfering with the armies covering the\r\ncapital when it was sought to defend it by an offensive movement against\r\nthe army guarding the Confederate capital.  He could see our weakness,\r\nbut he could not see that the enemy was in danger.  The enemy would not\r\nhave been in danger if Mr. Stanton had been in the field.  These\r\ncharacteristics of the two officials were clearly shown shortly after\r\nEarly came so near getting into the capital.\r\n\r\nAmong the army and corps commanders who served with me during the war\r\nbetween the States, and who attracted much public attention, but of\r\nwhose ability as soldiers I have not yet given any estimate, are Meade,\r\nHancock, Sedgwick, Burnside, Terry and Hooker.  There were others of\r\ngreat merit, such as Griffin, Humphreys, Wright and Mackenzie.  Of those\r\nfirst named, Burnside at one time had command of the Army of the\r\nPotomac, and later of the Army of the Ohio.  Hooker also commanded the\r\nArmy of the Potomac for a short time.\r\n\r\nGeneral Meade was an officer of great merit, with drawbacks to his\r\nusefulness that were beyond his control.  He had been an officer of the\r\nengineer corps before the war, and consequently had never served with\r\ntroops until he was over forty-six years of age.  He never had, I\r\nbelieve, a command of less than a brigade.  He saw clearly and\r\ndistinctly the position of the enemy, and the topography of the country\r\nin front of his own position.  His first idea was to take advantage of\r\nthe lay of the ground, sometimes without reference to the direction we\r\nwanted to move afterwards.  He was subordinate to his superiors in rank\r\nto the extent that he could execute an order which changed his own plans\r\nwith the same zeal he would have displayed if the plan had been his own.\r\nHe was brave and conscientious, and commanded the respect of all who\r\nknew him.  He was unfortunately of a temper that would get beyond his\r\ncontrol, at times, and make him speak to officers of high rank in the\r\nmost offensive manner.  No one saw this fault more plainly than he\r\nhimself, and no one regretted it more.  This made it unpleasant at\r\ntimes, even in battle, for those around him to approach him even with\r\ninformation.  In spite of this defect he was a most valuable officer and\r\ndeserves a high place in the annals of his country.\r\n\r\nGeneral Burnside was an officer who was generally liked and respected.\r\nHe was not, however, fitted to command an army.  No one knew this better\r\nthan himself.  He always admitted his blunders, and extenuated those of\r\nofficers under him beyond what they were entitled to.  It was hardly his\r\nfault that he was ever assigned to a separate command.\r\n\r\nOf Hooker I saw but little during the war.  I had known him very well\r\nbefore, however.  Where I did see him, at Chattanooga, his achievement\r\nin bringing his command around the point of Lookout Mountain and into\r\nChattanooga Valley was brilliant.  I nevertheless regarded him as a\r\ndangerous man.  He was not subordinate to his superiors.  He was\r\nambitious to the extent of caring nothing for the rights of others.  His\r\ndisposition was, when engaged in battle, to get detached from the main\r\nbody of the army and exercise a separate command, gathering to his\r\nstandard all he could of his juniors.\r\n\r\nHancock stands the most conspicuous figure of all the general officers\r\nwho did not exercise a separate command.  He commanded a corps longer\r\nthan any other one, and his name was never mentioned as having committed\r\nin battle a blunder for which he was responsible.  He was a man of very\r\nconspicuous personal appearance.  Tall, well-formed and, at the time of\r\nwhich I now write, young and fresh-looking, he presented an appearance\r\nthat would attract the attention of an army as he passed.  His genial\r\ndisposition made him friends, and his personal courage and his presence\r\nwith his command in the thickest of the fight won for him the confidence\r\nof troops serving under him.  No matter how hard the fight, the 2d corps\r\nalways felt that their commander was looking after them.\r\n\r\nSedgwick was killed at Spottsylvania before I had an opportunity of\r\nforming an estimate of his qualifications as a soldier from personal\r\nobservation.  I had known him in Mexico when both of us were\r\nlieutenants, and when our service gave no indication that either of us\r\nwould ever be equal to the command of a brigade. He stood very high in\r\nthe army, however, as an officer and a man. He was brave and\r\nconscientious.  His ambition was not great, and he seemed to dread\r\nresponsibility.  He was willing to do any amount of battling, but always\r\nwanted some one else to direct. He declined the command of the Army of\r\nthe Potomac once, if not oftener.\r\n\r\nGeneral Alfred H. Terry came into the army as a volunteer without a\r\nmilitary education.  His way was won without political influence up to\r\nan important separate command--the expedition against Fort Fisher, in\r\nJanuary, 1865.  His success there was most brilliant, and won for him\r\nthe rank of brigadier-general in the regular army and of major-general\r\nof volunteers.  He is a man who makes friends of those under him by his\r\nconsideration of their wants and their dues.  As a commander, he won\r\ntheir confidence by his coolness in action and by his clearness of\r\nperception in taking in the situation under which he was placed at any\r\ngiven time.\r\n\r\nGriffin, Humphreys, and Mackenzie were good corps commanders, but came\r\ninto that position so near to the close of the war as not to attract\r\npublic attention.  All three served as such, in the last campaign of the\r\narmies of the Potomac and the James, which culminated at Appomattox\r\nCourt House, on the 9th of April, 1865.  The sudden collapse of the\r\nrebellion monopolized attention to the exclusion of almost everything\r\nelse.  I regarded Mackenzie as the most promising young officer in the\r\narmy.  Graduating at West Point, as he did, during the second year of\r\nthe war, he had won his way up to the command of a corps before its\r\nclose.  This he did upon his own merit and without influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the great War of the Rebellion against the United Status\r\nwill have to be attributed to slavery.  For some years before the war\r\nbegan it was a trite saying among some politicians that \"A state half\r\nslave and half free cannot exist.\"  All must become slave or all free,\r\nor the state will go down.  I took no part myself in any such view of\r\nthe case at the time, but since the war is over, reviewing the whole\r\nquestion, I have come to the conclusion that the saying is quite true.\r\n\r\nSlavery was an institution that required unusual guarantees for its\r\nsecurity wherever it existed; and in a country like ours where the\r\nlarger portion of it was free territory inhabited by an intelligent and\r\nwell-to-do population, the people would naturally have but little\r\nsympathy with demands upon them for its protection.  Hence the people of\r\nthe South were dependent upon keeping control of the general government\r\nto secure the perpetuation of their favorite institution.  They were\r\nenabled to maintain this control long after the States where slavery\r\nexisted had ceased to have the controlling power, through the assistance\r\nthey received from odd men here and there throughout the Northern\r\nStates.  They saw their power waning, and this led them to encroach upon\r\nthe prerogatives and independence of the Northern States by enacting\r\nsuch laws as the Fugitive Slave Law.  By this law every Northern man\r\nwas obliged, when properly summoned, to turn out and help apprehend\r\nthe runaway slave of a Southern man.  Northern marshals became\r\nslave-catchers, and Northern courts had to contribute to the support\r\nand protection of the institution.\r\n\r\nThis was a degradation which the North would not permit any longer than\r\nuntil they could get the power to expunge such laws from the statute\r\nbooks.  Prior to the time of these encroachments the great majority of\r\nthe people of the North had no particular quarrel with slavery, so long\r\nas they were not forced to have it themselves.  But they were not\r\nwilling to play the role of police for the South in the protection of\r\nthis particular institution.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the country, before we had railroads, telegraphs\r\nand steamboats--in a word, rapid transit of any sort--the States were\r\neach almost a separate nationality.  At that time the subject of slavery\r\ncaused but little or no disturbance to the public mind.  But the country\r\ngrew, rapid transit was established, and trade and commerce between the\r\nStates got to be so much greater than before, that the power of the\r\nNational government became more felt and recognized and, therefore, had\r\nto be enlisted in the cause of this institution.\r\n\r\nIt is probably well that we had the war when we did.  We are better off\r\nnow than we would have been without it, and have made more rapid\r\nprogress than we otherwise should have made.  The civilized nations of\r\nEurope have been stimulated into unusual activity, so that commerce,\r\ntrade, travel, and thorough acquaintance among people of different\r\nnationalities, has become common; whereas, before, it was but the few\r\nwho had ever had the privilege of going beyond the limits of their own\r\ncountry or who knew anything about other people.  Then, too, our\r\nrepublican institutions were regarded as experiments up to the breaking\r\nout of the rebellion, and monarchical Europe generally believed that our\r\nrepublic was a rope of sand that would part the moment the slightest\r\nstrain was brought upon it.  Now it has shown itself capable of dealing\r\nwith one of the greatest wars that was ever made, and our people have\r\nproven themselves to be the most formidable in war of any nationality.\r\n\r\nBut this war was a fearful lesson, and should teach us the necessity of\r\navoiding wars in the future.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of some of the European states during our troubles shows the\r\nlack of conscience of communities where the responsibility does not come\r\nupon a single individual.  Seeing a nation that extended from ocean to\r\nocean, embracing the better part of a continent, growing as we were\r\ngrowing in population, wealth and intelligence, the European nations\r\nthought it would be well to give us a check.  We might, possibly, after\r\na while threaten their peace, or, at least, the perpetuity of their\r\ninstitutions.  Hence, England was constantly finding fault with the\r\nadministration at Washington because we were not able to keep up an\r\neffective blockade.  She also joined, at first, with France and Spain in\r\nsetting up an Austrian prince upon the throne in Mexico, totally\r\ndisregarding any rights or claims that Mexico had of being treated as an\r\nindependent power.  It is true they trumped up grievances as a pretext,\r\nbut they were only pretexts which can always be found when wanted.\r\n\r\nMexico, in her various revolutions, had been unable to give that\r\nprotection to the subjects of foreign nations which she would have liked\r\nto give, and some of her revolutionary leaders had forced loans from\r\nthem.  Under pretence of protecting their citizens, these nations seized\r\nupon Mexico as a foothold for establishing a European monarchy upon our\r\ncontinent, thus threatening our peace at home.  I, myself, regarded this\r\nas a direct act of war against the United States by the powers engaged,\r\nand supposed as a matter of course that the United States would treat it\r\nas such when their hands were free to strike.  I often spoke of the\r\nmatter to Mr. Lincoln and the Secretary of War, but never heard any\r\nspecial views from them to enable me to judge what they thought or felt\r\nabout it.  I inferred that they felt a good deal as I did, but were\r\nunwilling to commit themselves while we had our own troubles upon our\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nAll of the powers except France very soon withdrew from the armed\r\nintervention for the establishment of an Austrian prince upon the throne\r\nof Mexico; but the governing people of these countries continued to the\r\nclose of the war to throw obstacles in our way.  After the surrender of\r\nLee, therefore, entertaining the opinion here expressed, I sent Sheridan\r\nwith a corps to the Rio Grande to have him where he might aid Juarez in\r\nexpelling the French from Mexico.  These troops got off before they\r\ncould be stopped; and went to the Rio Grande, where Sheridan distributed\r\nthem up and down the river, much to the consternation of the troops in\r\nthe quarter of Mexico bordering on that stream.  This soon led to a\r\nrequest from France that we should withdraw our troops from the Rio\r\nGrande and to negotiations for the withdrawal of theirs.  Finally\r\nBazaine was withdrawn from Mexico by order of the French Government.\r\nFrom that day the empire began to totter.  Mexico was then able to\r\nmaintain her independence without aid from us.\r\n\r\nFrance is the traditional ally and friend of the United States.  I did\r\nnot blame France for her part in the scheme to erect a monarchy upon the\r\nruins of the Mexican Republic.  That was the scheme of one man, an\r\nimitator without genius or merit.  He had succeeded in stealing the\r\ngovernment of his country, and made a change in its form against the\r\nwishes and instincts of his people.  He tried to play the part of the\r\nfirst Napoleon, without the ability to sustain that role.  He sought by\r\nnew conquests to add to his empire and his glory; but the signal failure\r\nof his scheme of conquest was the precursor of his own overthrow.\r\n\r\nLike our own war between the States, the Franco-Prussian war was an\r\nexpensive one; but it was worth to France all it cost her people.  It\r\nwas the completion of the downfall of Napoleon III.  The beginning was\r\nwhen he landed troops on this continent.  Failing here, the prestige of\r\nhis name--all the prestige he ever had--was gone.  He must achieve a\r\nsuccess or fall.  He tried to strike down his neighbor, Prussia--and\r\nfell.\r\n\r\nI never admired the character of the first Napoleon; but I recognize his\r\ngreat genius.  His work, too, has left its impress for good on the face\r\nof Europe.  The third Napoleon could have no claim to having done a good\r\nor just act.\r\n\r\nTo maintain peace in the future it is necessary to be prepared for war.\r\nThere can scarcely be a possible chance of a conflict, such as the last\r\none, occurring among our own people again; but, growing as we are, in\r\npopulation, wealth and military power, we may become the envy of nations\r\nwhich led us in all these particulars only a few years ago; and unless\r\nwe are prepared for it we may be in danger of a combined movement being\r\nsome day made to crush us out.  Now, scarcely twenty years after the\r\nwar, we seem to have forgotten the lessons it taught, and are going on\r\nas if in the greatest security, without the power to resist an invasion\r\nby the fleets of fourth-rate European powers for a time until we could\r\nprepare for them.\r\n\r\nWe should have a good navy, and our sea-coast defences should be put in\r\nthe finest possible condition.  Neither of these cost much when it is\r\nconsidered where the money goes, and what we get in return.  Money\r\nexpended in a fine navy, not only adds to our security and tends to\r\nprevent war in the future, but is very material aid to our commerce with\r\nforeign nations in the meantime.  Money spent upon sea-coast defences is\r\nspent among our own people, and all goes back again among the people.\r\nThe work accomplished, too, like that of the navy, gives us a feeling of\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nEngland's course towards the United States during the rebellion\r\nexasperated the people of this country very much against the mother\r\ncountry.  I regretted it.  England and the United States are natural\r\nallies, and should be the best of friends.  They speak one language, and\r\nare related by blood and other ties.  We together, or even either\r\nseparately, are better qualified than any other people to establish\r\ncommerce between all the nationalities of the world.\r\n\r\nEngland governs her own colonies, and particularly those embracing\r\nthe people of different races from her own, better than any other\r\nnation.  She is just to the conquered, but rigid.  She makes them\r\nself-supporting, but gives the benefit of labor to the laborer.  She\r\ndoes not seem to look upon the colonies as outside possessions which she\r\nis at liberty to work for the support and aggrandizement of the home\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe hostility of England to the United States during our rebellion was\r\nnot so much real as it was apparent.  It was the hostility of the\r\nleaders of one political party.  I am told that there was no time during\r\nthe civil war when they were able to get up in England a demonstration\r\nin favor of secession, while these were constantly being gotten up in\r\nfavor of the Union, or, as they called it, in favor of the North.  Even\r\nin Manchester, which suffered so fearfully by having the cotton cut off\r\nfrom her mills, they had a monster demonstration in favor of the North\r\nat the very time when their workmen were almost famishing.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the question of a conflict between races may come up\r\nin the future, as did that between freedom and slavery before.  The\r\ncondition of the colored man within our borders may become a source of\r\nanxiety, to say the least.  But he was brought to our shores by\r\ncompulsion, and he now should be considered as having as good a right to\r\nremain here as any other class of our citizens.  It was looking to a\r\nsettlement of this question that led me to urge the annexation of Santo\r\nDomingo during the time I was President of the United States.\r\n\r\nSanto Domingo was freely offered to us, not only by the administration,\r\nbut by all the people, almost without price. The island is upon our\r\nshores, is very fertile, and is capable of supporting fifteen millions\r\nof people.  The products of the soil are so valuable that labor in her\r\nfields would be so compensated as to enable those who wished to go there\r\nto quickly repay the cost of their passage.  I took it that the colored\r\npeople would go there in great numbers, so as to have independent states\r\ngoverned by their own race.  They would still be States of the Union,\r\nand under the protection of the General Government; but the citizens\r\nwould be almost wholly colored.\r\n\r\nBy the war with Mexico, we had acquired, as we have seen, territory\r\nalmost equal in extent to that we already possessed. It was seen that\r\nthe volunteers of the Mexican war largely composed the pioneers to\r\nsettle up the Pacific coast country. Their numbers, however, were\r\nscarcely sufficient to be a nucleus for the population of the important\r\npoints of the territory acquired by that war.  After our rebellion, when\r\nso many young men were at liberty to return to their homes, they found\r\nthey were not satisfied with the farm, the store, or the work-shop of\r\nthe villages, but wanted larger fields.  The mines of the mountains\r\nfirst attracted them; but afterwards they found that rich valleys and\r\nproductive grazing and farming lands were there.  This territory, the\r\ngeography of which was not known to us at the close of the rebellion, is\r\nnow as well mapped as any portion of our country.  Railroads traverse it\r\nin every direction, north, south, east, and west.  The mines are worked.\r\nThe high lands are used for grazing purposes, and rich agricultural\r\nlands are found in many of the valleys.  This is the work of the\r\nvolunteer.  It is probable that the Indians would have had control of\r\nthese lands for a century yet but for the war.  We must conclude,\r\ntherefore, that wars are not always evils unmixed with some good.\r\n\r\nPrior to the rebellion the great mass of the people were satisfied to\r\nremain near the scenes of their birth.  In fact an immense majority of\r\nthe whole people did not feel secure against coming to want should they\r\nmove among entire strangers.  So much was the country divided into small\r\ncommunities that localized idioms had grown up, so that you could almost\r\ntell what section a person was from by hearing him speak.  Before, new\r\nterritories were settled by a \"class\"; people who shunned contact with\r\nothers; people who, when the country began to settle up around them,\r\nwould push out farther from civilization.  Their guns furnished meat,\r\nand the cultivation of a very limited amount of the soil, their bread\r\nand vegetables.  All the streams abounded with fish.  Trapping would\r\nfurnish pelts to be brought into the States once a year, to pay for\r\nnecessary articles which they could not raise--powder, lead, whiskey,\r\ntobacco and some store goods.  Occasionally some little articles of\r\nluxury would enter into these purchases--a quarter of a pound of tea,\r\ntwo or three pounds of coffee, more of sugar, some playing cards, and if\r\nanything was left over of the proceeds of the sale, more whiskey.\r\n\r\nLittle was known of the topography of the country beyond the settlements\r\nof these frontiersmen.  This is all changed now. The war begot a spirit\r\nof independence and enterprise.  The feeling now is, that a youth must\r\ncut loose from his old surroundings to enable him to get up in the\r\nworld.  There is now such a commingling of the people that particular\r\nidioms and pronunciation are no longer localized to any great extent;\r\nthe country has filled up \"from the centre all around to the sea\";\r\nrailroads connect the two oceans and all parts of the interior; maps,\r\nnearly perfect, of every part of the country are now furnished the\r\nstudent of geography.\r\n\r\nThe war has made us a nation of great power and intelligence. We have\r\nbut little to do to preserve peace, happiness and prosperity at home,\r\nand the respect of other nations.  Our experience ought to teach us the\r\nnecessity of the first; our power secures the latter.\r\n\r\nI feel that we are on the eve of a new era, when there is to be great\r\nharmony between the Federal and Confederate.  I cannot stay to be a\r\nliving witness to the correctness of this prophecy; but I feel it within\r\nme that it is to be so.  The universally kind feeling expressed for me\r\nat a time when it was supposed that each day would prove my last, seemed\r\nto me the beginning of the answer to \"Let us have peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe expression of these kindly feelings were not restricted to a section\r\nof the country, nor to a division of the people.  They came from\r\nindividual citizens of all nationalities; from all denominations--the\r\nProtestant, the Catholic, and the Jew; and from the various societies of\r\nthe land--scientific, educational, religious or otherwise.  Politics did\r\nnot enter into the matter at all.\r\n\r\nI am not egotist enough to suppose all this significance should be given\r\nbecause I was the object of it.  But the war between the States was a\r\nvery bloody and a very costly war.  One side or the other had to yield\r\nprinciples they deemed dearer than life before it could be brought to an\r\nend.  I commanded the whole of the mighty host engaged on the victorious\r\nside.  I was, no matter whether deservedly so or not, a representative\r\nof that side of the controversy.  It is a significant and gratifying\r\nfact that Confederates should have joined heartily in this spontaneous\r\nmove.  I hope the good feeling inaugurated may continue to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nREPORT OF LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT, OF THE UNITED STATES ARMIES\r\n1864-65.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, WASHINGTON, D. C., July 22,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nHON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nSIR:  I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations\r\nof the Armies of the United States from the date of my appointment to\r\ncommand the same.\r\n\r\nFrom an early period in the rebellion I had been impressed with the idea\r\nthat active and continuous operations of all the troops that could be\r\nbrought into the field, regardless of season and weather, were necessary\r\nto a speedy termination of the war.  The resources of the enemy and his\r\nnumerical strength were far inferior to ours; but as an offset to this,\r\nwe had a vast territory, with a population hostile to the government, to\r\ngarrison, and long lines of river and railroad communications to\r\nprotect, to enable us to supply the operating armies.\r\n\r\nThe armies in the East and West acted independently and without concert,\r\nlike a balky team, no two ever pulling together, enabling the enemy to\r\nuse to great advantage his interior lines of communication for\r\ntransporting troops from East to West, reinforcing the army most\r\nvigorously pressed, and to furlough large numbers, during seasons of\r\ninactivity on our part, to go to their homes and do the work of\r\nproducing, for the support of their armies.  It was a question whether\r\nour numerical strength and resources were not more than balanced by\r\nthese disadvantages and the enemy's superior position.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, I was firm in the conviction that no peace could be had\r\nthat would be stable and conducive to the happiness of the people, both\r\nNorth and South, until the military power of the rebellion was entirely\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nI therefore determined, first, to use the greatest number of troops\r\npracticable against the armed force of the enemy; preventing him from\r\nusing the same force at different seasons against first one and then\r\nanother of our armies, and the possibility of repose for refitting and\r\nproducing necessary supplies for carrying on resistance.  Second, to\r\nhammer continuously against the armed force of the enemy and his\r\nresources, until by mere attrition, if in no other way, there should be\r\nnothing left to him but an equal submission with the loyal section of\r\nour common country to the constitution and laws of the land.\r\n\r\nThese views have been kept constantly in mind, and orders given and\r\ncampaigns made to carry them out.  Whether they might have been better\r\nin conception and execution is for the people, who mourn the loss of\r\nfriends fallen, and who have to pay the pecuniary cost, to say.  All I\r\ncan say is, that what I have done has been done conscientiously, to the\r\nbest of my ability, and in what I conceived to be for the best interests\r\nof the whole country.\r\n\r\nAt the date when this report begins, the situation of the contending\r\nforces was about as follows:  The Mississippi River was strongly\r\ngarrisoned by Federal troops, from St.  Louis, Missouri, to its mouth.\r\nThe line of the Arkansas was also held, thus giving us armed possession\r\nof all west of the Mississippi, north of that stream.  A few points in\r\nSouthern Louisiana, not remote from the river, were held by us, together\r\nwith a small garrison at and near the mouth of the Rio Grande.  All the\r\nbalance of the vast territory of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas was in\r\nthe almost undisputed possession of the enemy, with an army of probably\r\nnot less than eighty thousand effective men, that could have been\r\nbrought into the field had there been sufficient opposition to have\r\nbrought them out.  The let-alone policy had demoralized this force so\r\nthat probably but little more than one-half of it was ever present in\r\ngarrison at any one time.  But the one-half, or forty thousand men, with\r\nthe bands of guerillas scattered through Missouri, Arkansas, and along\r\nthe Mississippi River, and the disloyal character of much of the\r\npopulation, compelled the use of a large number of troops to keep\r\nnavigation open on the river, and to protect the loyal people to the\r\nwest of it.  To the east of the Mississippi we held substantially with\r\nthe line of the Tennessee and Holston rivers, running eastward to\r\ninclude nearly all of the State of Tennessee.  South of Chattanooga, a\r\nsmall foothold had been obtained in Georgia, sufficient to protect East\r\nTennessee from incursions from the enemy's force at Dalton, Georgia.\r\nWest Virginia was substantially within our lines.  Virginia, with the\r\nexception of the northern border, the Potomac River, a small area about\r\nthe mouth of James River, covered by the troops at Norfolk and Fort\r\nMonroe, and the territory covered by the Army of the Potomac lying along\r\nthe Rapidan, was in the possession of the enemy.  Along the sea-coast\r\nfootholds had been obtained at Plymouth, Washington, and New Bern, in\r\nNorth Carolina; Beaufort, Folly and Morris Islands, Hilton Head, Fort\r\nPulaski, and Port Royal, in South Carolina; Fernandina and St.\r\nAugustine, in Florida. Key West and Pensacola were also in our\r\npossession, while all the important ports were blockaded by the navy.\r\nThe accompanying map, a copy of which was sent to General Sherman and\r\nother commanders in March, 1864, shows by red lines the territory\r\noccupied by us at the beginning of the rebellion, and at the opening of\r\nthe campaign of 1864, while those in blue are the lines which it was\r\nproposed to occupy.\r\n\r\nBehind the Union lines there were many bands of guerillas and a large\r\npopulation disloyal to the government, making it necessary to guard\r\nevery foot of road or river used in supplying our armies.  In the South,\r\na reign of military despotism prevailed, which made every man and boy\r\ncapable of bearing arms a soldier; and those who could not bear arms in\r\nthe field acted as provosts for collecting deserters and returning them.\r\nThis enabled the enemy to bring almost his entire strength into the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had concentrated the bulk of his forces east of the\r\nMississippi into two armies, commanded by Generals R. E. Lee and J. E.\r\nJohnston, his ablest and best generals.  The army commanded by Lee\r\noccupied the south bank of the Rapidan, extending from Mine Run\r\nwestward, strongly intrenched, covering and defending Richmond, the\r\nrebel capital, against the Army of the Potomac. The army under Johnston\r\noccupied a strongly intrenched position at Dalton, Georgia, covering and\r\ndefending Atlanta, Georgia, a place of great importance as a railroad\r\ncentre, against the armies under Major-General W. T. Sherman.  In\r\naddition to these armies he had a large cavalry force under Forrest, in\r\nNorth-east Mississippi; a considerable force, of all arms, in the\r\nShenandoah Valley, and in the western part of Virginia and extreme\r\neastern part of Tennessee; and also confronting our sea-coast garrisons,\r\nand holding blockaded ports where we had no foothold upon land.\r\n\r\nThese two armies, and the cities covered and defended by them, were the\r\nmain objective points of the campaign.\r\n\r\nMajor-General W. T. Sherman, who was appointed to the command of the\r\nMilitary Division of the Mississippi, embracing all the armies and\r\nterritory east of the Mississippi River to the Alleghanies and the\r\nDepartment of Arkansas, west of the Mississippi, had the immediate\r\ncommand of the armies operating against Johnston.\r\n\r\nMajor-General George G. Meade had the immediate command of the Army of\r\nthe Potomac, from where I exercised general supervision of the movements\r\nof all our armies.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman was instructed to move against Johnston's army, to break\r\nit up, and to go into the interior of the enemy's country as far as he\r\ncould, inflicting all the damage he could upon their war resources.  If\r\nthe enemy in his front showed signs of joining Lee, to follow him up to\r\nthe full extent of his ability, while I would prevent the concentration\r\nof Lee upon him, if it was in the power of the Army of the Potomac to do\r\nso.  More specific written instructions were not given, for the reason\r\nthat I had talked over with him the plans of the campaign, and was\r\nsatisfied that he understood them and would execute them to the fullest\r\nextent possible.\r\n\r\nMajor-General N. P. Banks, then on an expedition up Red River against\r\nShreveport, Louisiana (which had been organized previous to my\r\nappointment to command), was notified by me on the 15th of March, of the\r\nimportance it was that Shreveport should be taken at the earliest\r\npossible day, and that if he found that the taking of it would occupy\r\nfrom ten to fifteen days' more time than General Sherman had given his\r\ntroops to be absent from their command, he would send them back at the\r\ntime specified by General Sherman, even if it led to the abandonment of\r\nthe main object of the Red River expedition, for this force was\r\nnecessary to movements east of the Mississippi; that should his\r\nexpedition prove successful, he would hold Shreveport and the Red River\r\nwith such force as he might deem necessary, and return the balance of\r\nhis troops to the neighborhood of New Orleans, commencing no move for\r\nthe further acquisition of territory, unless it was to make that then\r\nheld by him more easily held; that it might be a part of the spring\r\ncampaign to move against Mobile; that it certainly would be, if troops\r\nenough could be obtained to make it without embarrassing other\r\nmovements; that New Orleans would be the point of departure for such an\r\nexpedition; also, that I had directed General Steele to make a real move\r\nfrom Arkansas, as suggested by him (General Banks), instead of a\r\ndemonstration, as Steele thought advisable.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of March, in addition to the foregoing notification and\r\ndirections, he was instructed as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"1st.  If successful in your expedition against Shreveport, that you\r\nturn over the defence of the Red River to General Steele and the navy.\r\n\r\n\"2d.  That you abandon Texas entirely, with the exception of your hold\r\nupon the Rio Grande.  This can be held with four thousand men, if they\r\nwill turn their attention immediately to fortifying their positions.  At\r\nleast one-half of the force required for this service might be taken\r\nfrom the colored troops.\r\n\r\n\"3d.  By properly fortifying on the Mississippi River, the force to\r\nguard it from Port Hudson to New Orleans can be reduced to ten thousand\r\nmen, if not to a less number.  Six thousand more would then hold all the\r\nrest of the territory necessary to hold until active operations can\r\nagain be resumed west of the river. According to your last return, this\r\nwould give you a force of over thirty thousand effective men with which\r\nto move against Mobile.  To this I expect to add five thousand men from\r\nMissouri.  If however, you think the force here stated too small to hold\r\nthe territory regarded as necessary to hold possession of, I would say\r\nconcentrate at least twenty-five thousand men of your present command\r\nfor operations against Mobile.  With these and such additions as I can\r\ngive you from elsewhere, lose no time in making a demonstration, to be\r\nfollowed by an attack upon Mobile.  Two or more iron-clads will be\r\nordered to report to Admiral Farragut.  This gives him a strong naval\r\nfleet with which to co-operate.  You can make your own arrangements with\r\nthe admiral for his co-operation, and select your own line of approach.\r\nMy own idea of the matter is that Pascagoula should be your base; but,\r\nfrom your long service in the Gulf Department, you will know best about\r\nthe matter.  It is intended that your movements shall be co-operative\r\nwith movements elsewhere, and you cannot now start too soon.  All I\r\nwould now add is, that you commence the concentration of your forces at\r\nonce.  Preserve a profound secrecy of what you intend doing, and start\r\nat the earliest possible moment.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor-General Meade was instructed that Lee's army would be his\r\nobjective point; that wherever Lee went he would go also.  For his\r\nmovement two plans presented themselves:  One to cross the Rapidan below\r\nLee, moving by his right flank; the other above, moving by his left.\r\nEach presented advantages over the other, with corresponding objections.\r\nBy crossing above, Lee would be cut off from all chance of ignoring\r\nRichmond or going north on a raid.  But if we took this route, all we\r\ndid would have to be done whilst the rations we started with held out;\r\nbesides, it separated us from Butler, so that he could not be directed\r\nhow to cooperate.  If we took the other route, Brandy Station could be\r\nused as a base of supplies until another was secured on the York or\r\nJames rivers.  Of these, however, it was decided to take the lower\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nThe following letter of instruction was addressed to Major-General B. F.\r\nButler:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"FORT MONROE, VIRGINIA, April 2, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:-In the spring campaign, which it is desirable shall commence\r\nat as early a day as practicable, it is proposed to have cooperative\r\naction of all the armies in the field, as far as this object can be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\"It will not be possible to unite our armies into two or three large\r\nones to act as so many units, owing to the absolute necessity of holding\r\non to the territory already taken from the enemy.  But, generally\r\nspeaking, concentration can be practically effected by armies moving to\r\nthe interior of the enemy's country from the territory they have to\r\nguard.  By such movement, they interpose themselves between the enemy\r\nand the country to be guarded, thereby reducing the number necessary to\r\nguard important points, or at least occupy the attention of a part of\r\nthe enemy's force, if no greater object is gained. Lee's army and\r\nRichmond being the greater objects towards which our attention must be\r\ndirected in the next campaign, it is desirable to unite all the force we\r\ncan against them.  The necessity of covering Washington with the Army of\r\nthe Potomac, and of covering your department with your army, makes it\r\nimpossible to unite these forces at the beginning of any move. I\r\npropose, therefore, what comes nearest this of anything that seems\r\npracticable:  The Army of the Potomac will act from its present base,\r\nLee's army being the objective point.  You will collect all the forces\r\nfrom your command that can be spared from garrison duty--I should say\r\nnot less than twenty thousand effective men--to operate on the south\r\nside of James River, Richmond being your objective point.  To the force\r\nyou already have will be added about ten thousand men from South\r\nCarolina, under Major-General Gillmore, who will command them in person.\r\nMajor-General W. F. Smith is ordered to report to you, to command the\r\ntroops sent into the field from your own department.\r\n\r\n\"General Gillmore will be ordered to report to you at Fortress Monroe,\r\nwith all the troops on transports, by the 18th instant, or as soon\r\nthereafter as practicable.  Should you not receive notice by that time\r\nto move, you will make such disposition of them and your other forces as\r\nyou may deem best calculated to deceive the enemy as to the real move to\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\n\"When you are notified to move, take City Point with as much force as\r\npossible.  Fortify, or rather intrench, at once, and concentrate all\r\nyour troops for the field there as rapidly as you can.  From City Point\r\ndirections cannot be given at this time for your further movements.\r\n\r\n\"The fact that has already been stated--that is, that Richmond is to be\r\nyour objective point, and that there is to be co-operation between your\r\nforce and the Army of the Potomac--must be your guide.  This indicates\r\nthe necessity of your holding close to the south bank of the James River\r\nas you advance.  Then, should the enemy be forced into his intrenchments\r\nin Richmond, the Army of the Potomac would follow, and by means of\r\ntransports the two armies would become a unit.\r\n\r\n\"All the minor details of your advance are left entirely to your\r\ndirection. If, however, you think it practicable to use your cavalry\r\nsouth of you, so as to cut the railroad about Hicksford, about the time\r\nof the general advance, it would be of immense advantage.\r\n\r\n\"You will please forward for my information, at the earliest practicable\r\nday, all orders, details, and instructions you may give for the\r\nexecution of this order.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL B. F. BUTLER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 16th these instructions were substantially reiterated. On the\r\n19th, in order to secure full co-operation between his army and that of\r\nGeneral Meade, he was informed that I expected him to move from Fort\r\nMonroe the same day that General Meade moved from Culpeper.  The exact\r\ntime I was to telegraph him as soon as it was fixed, and that it would\r\nnot be earlier than the 27th of April; that it was my intention to fight\r\nLee between Culpeper and Richmond, if he would stand.  Should he,\r\nhowever, fall back into Richmond, I would follow up and make a junction\r\nwith his (General Butler's) army on the James River; that, could I be\r\ncertain he would be able to invest Richmond on the south side, so as to\r\nhave his left resting on the James, above the city, I would form the\r\njunction there; that circumstances might make this course advisable\r\nanyhow; that he should use every exertion to secure footing as far up\r\nthe south side of the river as he could, and as soon as possible after\r\nthe receipt of orders to move; that if he could not carry the city, he\r\nshould at least detain as large a force there as possible.\r\n\r\nIn co-operation with the main movements against Lee and Johnston, I was\r\ndesirous of using all other troops necessarily kept in departments\r\nremote from the fields of immediate operations, and also those kept in\r\nthe background for the protection of our extended lines between the\r\nloyal States and the armies operating against them.\r\n\r\nA very considerable force, under command of Major-General Sigel, was so\r\nheld for the protection of West Virginia, and the frontiers of Maryland\r\nand Pennsylvania.  Whilst these troops could not be withdrawn to distant\r\nfields without exposing the North to invasion by comparatively small\r\nbodies of the enemy, they could act directly to their front, and give\r\nbetter protection than if lying idle in garrison.  By such a movement\r\nthey would either compel the enemy to detach largely for the protection\r\nof his supplies and lines of communication, or he would lose them.\r\nGeneral Sigel was therefore directed to organize all his available force\r\ninto two expeditions, to move from Beverly and Charleston, under command\r\nof Generals Ord and Crook, against the East Tennessee and Virginia\r\nRailroad. Subsequently, General Ord having been relieved at his own\r\nrequest, General Sigel was instructed at his own suggestion, to give up\r\nthe expedition by Beverly, and to form two columns, one under General\r\nCrook, on the Kanawha, numbering about ten thousand men, and one on the\r\nShenandoah, numbering about seven thousand men.  The one on the\r\nShenandoah to assemble between Cumberland and the Shenandoah, and the\r\ninfantry and artillery advanced to Cedar Creek with such cavalry as\r\ncould be made available at the moment, to threaten the enemy in the\r\nShenandoah Valley, and advance as far as possible; while General Crook\r\nwould take possession of Lewisburg with part of his force and move down\r\nthe Tennessee Railroad, doing as much damage as he could, destroying the\r\nNew River Bridge and the salt-works, at Saltville, Va.\r\n\r\nOwing to the weather and bad condition of the roads, operations were\r\ndelayed until the 1st of May, when, everything being in readiness and\r\nthe roads favorable, orders were given for a general movement of all the\r\narmies not later than the 4th of May.\r\n\r\nMy first object being to break the military power of the rebellion, and\r\ncapture the enemy's important strongholds, made me desirous that General\r\nButler should succeed in his movement against Richmond, as that would\r\ntend more than anything else, unless it were the capture of Lee's army,\r\nto accomplish this desired result in the East. If he failed, it was my\r\ndetermination, by hard fighting, either to compel Lee to retreat, or to\r\nso cripple him that he could not detach a large force to go north, and\r\nstill retain enough for the defence of Richmond.  It was well\r\nunderstood, by both Generals Butler and Meade, before starting on the\r\ncampaign, that it was my intention to put both their armies south of the\r\nJames River, in case of failure to destroy Lee without it.\r\n\r\nBefore giving General Butler his instructions, I visited him at Fort\r\nMonroe, and in conversation pointed out the apparent importance of\r\ngetting possession of Petersburg, and destroying railroad communication\r\nas far south as possible.  Believing, however, in the practicability of\r\ncapturing Richmond unless it was reinforced, I made that the objective\r\npoint of his operations.  As the Army of the Potomac was to move\r\nsimultaneously with him, Lee could not detach from his army with safety,\r\nand the enemy did not have troops elsewhere to bring to the defence of\r\nthe city in time to meet a rapid movement from the north of James River.\r\n\r\nI may here state that, commanding all the armies as I did, I tried, as\r\nfar as possible, to leave General Meade in independent command of the\r\nArmy of the Potomac.  My instructions for that army were all through\r\nhim, and were general in their nature, leaving all the details and the\r\nexecution to him.  The campaigns that followed proved him to be the\r\nright man in the right place.  His commanding always in the presence of\r\nan officer superior to him in rank, has drawn from him much of that\r\npublic attention that his zeal and ability entitle him to, and which he\r\nwould otherwise have received.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the Army of the Potomac commenced early on the morning\r\nof the 4th of May, under the immediate direction and orders of\r\nMajor-General Meade, pursuant to instructions.  Before night, the whole\r\narmy was across the Rapidan (the fifth and sixth corps crossing at\r\nGermania Ford, and the second corps at Ely's Ford, the cavalry, under\r\nMajor-General Sheridan, moving in advance,) with the greater part of its\r\ntrains, numbering about four thousand wagons, meeting with but slight\r\nopposition.  The average distance travelled by the troops that day was\r\nabout twelve miles.  This I regarded as a great success, and it removed\r\nfrom my mind the most serious apprehensions I had entertained, that of\r\ncrossing the river in the face of an active, large, well-appointed, and\r\nably commanded army, and how so large a train was to be carried through\r\na hostile country, and protected.  Early on the 5th, the advance corps\r\n(the fifth, Major-General G. K. Warren commanding) met and engaged the\r\nenemy outside his intrenchments near Mine Run.  The battle raged\r\nfuriously all day, the whole army being brought into the fight as fast\r\nas the corps could be got upon the field, which, considering the density\r\nof the forest and narrowness of the roads, was done with commendable\r\npromptness.\r\n\r\nGeneral Burnside, with the ninth corps, was, at the time the Army of the\r\nPotomac moved, left with the bulk of his corps at the crossing of the\r\nRappahannock River and Alexandria Railroad, holding the road back to\r\nBull Run, with instructions not to move until he received notice that a\r\ncrossing of the Rapidan was secured, but to move promptly as soon as\r\nsuch notice was received.  This crossing he was apprised of on the\r\nafternoon of the 4th.  By six o'clock of the morning of the 6th he was\r\nleading his corps into action near the Wilderness Tavern, some of his\r\ntroops having marched a distance of over thirty miles, crossing both the\r\nRappahannock and Rapidan rivers.  Considering that a large proportion,\r\nprobably two-thirds of his command, was composed of new troops,\r\nunaccustomed to marches, and carrying the accoutrements of a soldier,\r\nthis was a remarkable march.\r\n\r\nThe battle of the Wilderness was renewed by us at five o'clock on the\r\nmorning of the 6th, and continued with unabated fury until darkness set\r\nin, each army holding substantially the same position that they had on\r\nthe evening of the 5th.  After dark, the enemy made a feeble attempt to\r\nturn our right flank, capturing several hundred prisoners and creating\r\nconsiderable confusion.  But the promptness of General Sedgwick, who was\r\npersonally present and commanded that part of our line, soon reformed it\r\nand restored order.  On the morning of the 7th, reconnoissances showed\r\nthat the enemy had fallen behind his intrenched lines, with pickets to\r\nthe front, covering a part of the battle-field.  From this it was\r\nevident to my mind that the two days' fighting had satisfied him of his\r\ninability to further maintain the contest in the open field,\r\nnotwithstanding his advantage of position, and that he would wait an\r\nattack behind his works. I therefore determined to push on and put my\r\nwhole force between him and Richmond; and orders were at once issued for\r\na movement by his right flank.  On the night of the 7th, the march was\r\ncommenced towards Spottsylvania Court House, the fifth corps moving on\r\nthe most direct road.  But the enemy having become apprised of our\r\nmovement, and having the shorter line, was enabled to reach there first.\r\nOn the 8th, General Warren met a force of the enemy, which had been sent\r\nout to oppose and delay his advance, to gain time to fortify the line\r\ntaken up at Spottsylvania.  This force was steadily driven back on the\r\nmain force, within the recently constructed works, after considerable\r\nfighting, resulting in severe loss to both sides.  On the morning of the\r\n9th, General Sheridan started on a raid against the enemy's lines of\r\ncommunication with Richmond.  The 9th, 10th, and 11th were spent in\r\nmanoeuvring and fighting, without decisive results.  Among the killed on\r\nthe 9th was that able and distinguished soldier Major-General John\r\nSedgwick, commanding the sixth army corps.  Major-General H. G. Wright\r\nsucceeded him in command.  Early on the morning of the 12th a general\r\nattack was made on the enemy in position.  The second corps,\r\nMajor-General Hancock commanding, carried a salient of his line,\r\ncapturing most of Johnson's division of Ewell's corps and twenty pieces\r\nof artillery.  But the resistance was so obstinate that the advantage\r\ngained did not prove decisive.  The 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, and\r\n18th, were consumed in manoeuvring and awaiting the arrival of\r\nreinforcements from Washington.  Deeming it impracticable to make any\r\nfurther attack upon the enemy at Spottsylvania Court House, orders were\r\nissued on the 15th with a view to a movement to the North Anna, to\r\ncommence at twelve o'clock on the night of the 19th.  Late in the\r\nafternoon of the 19th, Ewell's corps came out of its works on our\r\nextreme right flank; but the attack was promptly repulsed, with heavy\r\nloss. This delayed the movement to the North Anna until the night of the\r\n21st, when it was commenced.  But the enemy again, having the shorter\r\nline, and being in possession of the main roads, was enabled to reach\r\nthe North Anna in advance of us, and took position behind it.  The fifth\r\ncorps reached the North Anna on the afternoon of the 23d, closely\r\nfollowed by the sixth corps. The second and ninth corps got up about the\r\nsame time, the second holding the railroad bridge, and the ninth lying\r\nbetween that and Jericho Ford.  General Warren effected a crossing the\r\nsame afternoon, and got a position without much opposition. Soon after\r\ngetting into position he was violently attacked, but repulsed the enemy\r\nwith great slaughter.  On the 25th, General Sheridan rejoined the Army\r\nof the Potomac from the raid on which he started from Spottsylvania,\r\nhaving destroyed the depots at Beaver Dam and Ashland stations, four\r\ntrains of cars, large supplies of rations, and many miles of\r\nrailroad-track; recaptured about four hundred of our men on their way to\r\nRichmond as prisoners of war; met and defeated the enemy's cavalry at\r\nYellow Tavern; carried the first line of works around Richmond (but\r\nfinding the second line too strong to be carried by assault), recrossed\r\nto the north bank of the Chickahominy at Meadow Bridge under heavy fire,\r\nand moved by a detour to Haxall's Landing, on the James River, where he\r\ncommunicated with General Butler.  This raid had the effect of drawing\r\noff the whole of the enemy's cavalry force, making it comparatively easy\r\nto guard our trains.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler moved his main force up the James River, in pursuance of\r\ninstructions, on the 4th of May, General Gillmore having joined him with\r\nthe tenth corps.  At the same time he sent a force of one thousand eight\r\nhundred cavalry, by way of West Point, to form a junction with him\r\nwherever he might get a foothold, and a force of three thousand cavalry,\r\nunder General Kautz, from Suffolk, to operate against the road south of\r\nPetersburg and Richmond.  On the 5th, he occupied, without opposition,\r\nboth City Point and Bermuda Hundred, his movement being a complete\r\nsurprise.  On the 6th, he was in position with his main army, and\r\ncommenced intrenching.  On the 7th he made a reconnoissance against the\r\nPetersburg and Richmond Railroad, destroying a portion of it after some\r\nfighting.  On the 9th he telegraphed as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS, NEAR BERMUDA LANDING, May 9, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"HON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\"Our operations may be summed up in a few words.  With one thousand\r\nseven hundred cavalry we have advanced up the Peninsula, forced the\r\nChickahominy, and have safely, brought them to their present position.\r\nThese were colored cavalry, and are now holding our advance pickets\r\ntowards Richmond.\r\n\r\n\"General Kautz, with three thousand cavalry from Suffolk, on the same\r\nday with our movement up James River, forced the Black Water, burned the\r\nrailroad bridge at Stony Creek, below Petersburg, cutting into\r\nBeauregard's force at that point.\r\n\r\n\"We have landed here, intrenched ourselves, destroyed many miles of\r\nrailroad, and got a position which, with proper supplies, we can hold\r\nout against the whole of Lee's army.  I have ordered up the supplies.\r\n\r\n\"Beauregard, with a large portion of his force, was left south by the\r\ncutting of the railroads by Kautz.  That portion which reached\r\nPetersburg under Hill I have whipped to-day, killing and wounding many,\r\nand taking many prisoners, after a severe and well-contested fight.\r\n\r\n\"General Grant will not be troubled with any further reinforcements to\r\nLee from Beauregard's force.\r\n\r\n\"BENJ. F. BUTLER, Major-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 13th and morning of the 14th he carried a portion\r\nof the enemy's first line of defences at Drury's Bluff, or Fort Darling,\r\nwith small loss.  The time thus consumed from the 6th lost to us the\r\nbenefit of the surprise and capture of Richmond and Petersburg,\r\nenabling, as it did, Beauregard to collect his loose forces in North and\r\nSouth Carolina, and bring them to the defence of those places.  On the\r\n16th, the enemy attacked General Butler in his position in front of\r\nDrury's Bluff.  He was forced back, or drew back, into his intrenchments\r\nbetween the forks of the James and Appomattox rivers, the enemy\r\nintrenching strongly in his front, thus covering his railroads, the\r\ncity, and all that was valuable to him.  His army, therefore, though in\r\na position of great security, was as completely shut off from further\r\noperations directly against Richmond as if it had been in a bottle\r\nstrongly corked.  It required but a comparatively small force of the\r\nenemy to hold it there.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, General Kautz, with his cavalry, was started on a raid\r\nagainst the Danville Railroad, which he struck at Coalfield, Powhatan,\r\nand Chula Stations, destroying them, the railroad-track, two freight\r\ntrains, and one locomotive, together with large quantities of commissary\r\nand other stores; thence, crossing to the South Side Road, struck it at\r\nWilson's, Wellsville, and Black's and White's Stations, destroying the\r\nroad and station-houses; thence he proceeded to City Point, which he\r\nreached on the 18th.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of April, and prior to the movement of General Butler, the\r\nenemy, with a land force under General Hoke and an iron-clad ram,\r\nattacked Plymouth, N. C., commanded by General H. W. Wessells, and our\r\ngunboats there, and, after severe fighting, the place was carried by\r\nassault, and the entire garrison and armament captured.  The gunboat\r\nSmithfield was sunk, and the Miami disabled.\r\n\r\nThe army sent to operate against Richmond having hermetically sealed\r\nitself up at Bermuda Hundred, the enemy was enabled to bring the most,\r\nif not all, the reinforcements brought from the south by Beauregard\r\nagainst the Army of the Potomac. In addition to this reinforcement, a\r\nvery considerable one, probably not less than fifteen thousand men, was\r\nobtained by calling in the scattered troops under Breckinridge from the\r\nwestern part of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe position of Bermuda Hundred was as easy to defend as it was\r\ndifficult to operate from against the enemy.  I determined, therefore,\r\nto bring from it all available forces, leaving enough only to secure\r\nwhat had been gained; and accordingly, on the 22d, I directed that they\r\nbe sent forward, under command of Major-General W. F. Smith, to join the\r\nArmy of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of May, the 9th army corps, commanded by Major-General A. E.\r\nBurnside, was assigned to the Army of the Potomac, and from this time\r\nforward constituted a portion of Major-General Meade's command.\r\n\r\nFinding the enemy's position on the North Anna stronger than either of\r\nhis previous ones, I withdrew on the night of the 26th to the north bank\r\nof the North Anna, and moved via Hanover Town to turn the enemy's\r\nposition by his right.\r\n\r\nGenerals Torbert's and Merritt's divisions of cavalry, under Sheridan,\r\nand the 6th corps, led the advance, crossed the Pamunkey River at\r\nHanover Town, after considerable fighting, and on the 28th the two\r\ndivisions of cavalry had a severe, but successful engagement with the\r\nenemy at Hawes's Shop.  On the 29th and 30th we advanced, with heavy\r\nskirmishing, to the Hanover Court House and Cold Harbor Road, and\r\ndeveloped the enemy's position north of the Chickahominy.  Late on the\r\nevening of the last day the enemy came out and attacked our left, but\r\nwas repulsed with very considerable loss.  An attack was immediately\r\nordered by General Meade, along his whole line, which resulted in\r\ndriving the enemy from a part of his intrenched skirmish line.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st, General Wilson's division of cavalry destroyed the railroad\r\nbridges over the South Anna River, after defeating the enemy's cavalry.\r\nGeneral Sheridan, on the same day, reached Cold Harbor, and held it\r\nuntil relieved by the 6th corps and General Smith's command, which had\r\njust arrived, via White House, from General Butler's army.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of June an attack was made at five P.M. by the 6th corps\r\nand the troops under General Smith, the other corps being held in\r\nreadiness to advance on the receipt of orders. This resulted in our\r\ncarrying and holding the enemy's first line of works in front of the\r\nright of the 6th corps, and in front of General Smith.  During the\r\nattack the enemy made repeated assaults on each of the corps not engaged\r\nin the main attack, but was repulsed with heavy loss in every instance.\r\nThat night he made several assaults to regain what he had lost in the\r\nday, but failed.  The 2d was spent in getting troops into position for\r\nan attack on the 3d.  On the 3d of June we again assaulted the enemy's\r\nworks, in the hope of driving him from his position.  In this attempt\r\nour loss was heavy, while that of the enemy, I have reason to believe,\r\nwas comparatively light.  It was the only general attack made from the\r\nRapidan to the James which did not inflict upon the enemy losses to\r\ncompensate for our own losses.  I would not be understood as saying that\r\nall previous attacks resulted in victories to our arms, or accomplished\r\nas much as I had hoped from them; but they inflicted upon the enemy\r\nsevere losses, which tended, in the end, to the complete overthrow of\r\nthe rebellion.\r\n\r\nFrom the proximity of the enemy to his defences around Richmond, it was\r\nimpossible, by any flank movement, to interpose between him and the\r\ncity.  I was still in a condition to either move by his left flank, and\r\ninvest Richmond from the north side, or continue my move by his right\r\nflank to the south side of the James.  While the former might have been\r\nbetter as a covering for Washington, yet a full survey of all the ground\r\nsatisfied me that it would be impracticable to hold a line north and\r\neast of Richmond that would protect the Fredericksburg Railroad, a long,\r\nvulnerable line, which would exhaust much of our strength to guard, and\r\nthat would have to be protected to supply the army, and would leave open\r\nto the enemy all his lines of communication on the south side of the\r\nJames.  My idea, from the start, had been to beat Lee's army north of\r\nRichmond, if possible.  Then, after destroying his lines of\r\ncommunication north of the James River, to transfer the army to the\r\nsouth side, and besiege Lee in Richmond, or follow him south if he\r\nshould retreat.  After the battle of the Wilderness, it was evident that\r\nthe enemy deemed it of the first importance to run no risks with the\r\narmy he then had.  He acted purely on the defensive, behind breastworks,\r\nor feebly on the offensive immediately in front of them, and where, in\r\ncase of repulse, he could easily retire behind them.  Without a greater\r\nsacrifice of life than I was willing to make, all could not be\r\naccomplished that I had designed north of Richmond.  I therefore\r\ndetermined to continue to hold substantially the ground we then\r\noccupied, taking advantage of any favorable circumstances that might\r\npresent themselves, until the cavalry could be sent to Charlottesville\r\nand Gordonsville to effectually break up the railroad connection between\r\nRichmond and the Shenandoah Valley and Lynchburg; and when the cavalry\r\ngot well off, to move the army to the south side of the James River, by\r\nthe enemy's right flank, where I felt I could cut off all his sources of\r\nsupply, except by the canal.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, two divisions of cavalry, under General Sheridan, got off on\r\nthe expedition against the Virginia Central Railroad, with instructions\r\nto Hunter, whom I hoped he would meet near Charlottesville, to join his\r\nforces to Sheridan's, and after the work laid out for them was\r\nthoroughly done, to join the Army of the Potomac by the route laid down\r\nin Sheridan's instructions.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of June, General Butler sent a force of infantry, under\r\nGeneral Gillmore, and of cavalry under General Kautz, to capture\r\nPetersburg, if possible, and destroy the railroad and common bridges\r\nacross the Appomattox.  The cavalry carried the works on the south side,\r\nand penetrated well in towards the town, but were forced to retire.\r\nGeneral Gillmore, finding the works which he approached very strong, and\r\ndeeming an assault impracticable, returned to Bermuda Hundred without\r\nattempting one.\r\n\r\nAttaching great importance to the possession of Petersburg, I sent back\r\nto Bermuda Hundred and City Point, General Smith's command by water, via\r\nthe White House, to reach there in advance of the Army of the Potomac.\r\nThis was for the express purpose of securing Petersburg before the\r\nenemy, becoming aware of our intention, could reinforce the place.\r\n\r\nThe movement from Cold Harbor commenced after dark on the evening of the\r\n12th.  One division of cavalry, under General Wilson, and the 5th corps,\r\ncrossed the Chickahominy at Long Bridge, and moved out to White Oak\r\nSwamp, to cover the crossings of the other corps.  The advance corps\r\nreached James River, at Wilcox's Landing and Charles City Court House,\r\non the night of the 13th.\r\n\r\nDuring three long years the Armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginia\r\nhad been confronting each other.  In that time they had fought more\r\ndesperate battles than it probably ever before fell to the lot of two\r\narmies to fight, without materially changing the vantage ground of\r\neither.  The Southern press and people, with more shrewdness than was\r\ndisplayed in the North, finding that they had failed to capture\r\nWashington and march on to New York, as they had boasted they would do,\r\nassumed that they only defended their Capital and Southern territory.\r\nHence, Antietam, Gettysburg, and all the other battles that had been\r\nfought, were by them set down as failures on our part, and victories for\r\nthem.  Their army believed this.  It produced a morale which could only\r\nbe overcome by desperate and continuous hard fighting.  The battles of\r\nthe Wilderness, Spottsylvania, North Anna and Cold Harbor, bloody and\r\nterrible as they were on our side, were even more damaging to the enemy,\r\nand so crippled him as to make him wary ever after of taking the\r\noffensive.  His losses in men were probably not so great, owing to the\r\nfact that we were, save in the Wilderness, almost invariably the\r\nattacking party; and when he did attack, it was in the open field.  The\r\ndetails of these battles, which for endurance and bravery on the part of\r\nthe soldiery, have rarely been surpassed, are given in the report of\r\nMajor-General Meade, and the subordinate reports accompanying it.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign of forty-three days, from the Rapidan to the James\r\nRiver, the army had to be supplied from an ever-shifting base, by\r\nwagons, over narrow roads, through a densely wooded country, with a lack\r\nof wharves at each new base from which to conveniently discharge\r\nvessels.  Too much credit cannot, therefore, be awarded to the\r\nquartermaster and commissary departments for the zeal and efficiency\r\ndisplayed by them. Under the general supervision of the chief\r\nquartermaster, Brigadier-General R. Ingalls, the trains were made to\r\noccupy all the available roads between the army and our water-base, and\r\nbut little difficulty was experienced in protecting them.\r\n\r\nThe movement in the Kanawha and Shenandoah valleys, under General Sigel,\r\ncommenced on the 1st of May.  General Crook, who had the immediate\r\ncommand of the Kanawha expedition, divided his forces into two columns,\r\ngiving one, composed of cavalry, to General Averell.  They crossed the\r\nmountains by separate routes. Averell struck the Tennessee and Virginia\r\nRailroad, near Wytheville, on the 10th, and proceeding to New River and\r\nChristiansburg, destroyed the road, several important bridges and\r\ndepots, including New River Bridge, forming a junction with Crook at\r\nUnion on the 15th.  General Sigel moved up the Shenandoah Valley, met\r\nthe enemy at New Market on the 15th, and, after a severe engagement, was\r\ndefeated with heavy loss, and retired behind Cedar Creek.  Not regarding\r\nthe operations of General Sigel as satisfactory, I asked his removal\r\nfrom command, and Major-General Hunter appointed to supersede him.  His\r\ninstructions were embraced in the following dispatches to Major-General\r\nH. W. Halleck, chief of staff of the army:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE, VA. \"May 20, 1864.\r\n\r\n*        *        *        *        *        *        * \"The enemy are\r\nevidently relying for supplies greatly on such as are brought over the\r\nbranch road running through Staunton.  On the whole, therefore, I think\r\nit would be better for General Hunter to move in that direction; reach\r\nStaunton and Gordonsville or Charlottesville, if he does not meet too\r\nmuch opposition.  If he can hold at bay a force equal to his own, he\r\nwill be doing good service.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"JERICHO FORD, VA., May 25, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"If Hunter can possibly get to Charlottesville and Lynchburg, he should\r\ndo so, living on the country.  The railroads and canal should be\r\ndestroyed beyond possibility of repairs for weeks. Completing this, he\r\ncould find his way back to his original base, or from about Gordonsville\r\njoin this army.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Hunter immediately took up the offensive, and, moving up the\r\nShenandoah Valley, met the enemy on the 5th of June at Piedmont, and,\r\nafter a battle of ten hours, routed and defeated him, capturing on the\r\nfield of battle one thousand five hundred men, three pieces of\r\nartillery, and three hundred stand of small arms.  On the 8th of the\r\nsame month he formed a junction with Crook and Averell at Staunton, from\r\nwhich place he moved direct on Lynchburg, via Lexington, which place he\r\nreached and invested on the 16th day of June.  Up to this time he was\r\nvery successful; and but for the difficulty of taking with him\r\nsufficient ordnance stores over so long a march, through a hostile\r\ncountry, he would, no doubt, have captured that, to the enemy important,\r\npoint.  The destruction of the enemy's supplies and manufactories was\r\nvery great.  To meet this movement under General Hunter, General Lee\r\nsent a force, perhaps equal to a corps, a part of which reached\r\nLynchburg a short time before Hunter.  After some skirmishing on the\r\n17th and 18th, General Hunter, owing to a want of ammunition to give\r\nbattle, retired from before the place.  Unfortunately, this want of\r\nammunition left him no choice of route for his return but by way of\r\nKanawha. This lost to us the use of his troops for several weeks from\r\nthe defence of the North.\r\n\r\nHad General Hunter moved by way of Charlottesville, instead of\r\nLexington, as his instructions contemplated, he would have been in a\r\nposition to have covered the Shenandoah Valley against the enemy, should\r\nthe force he met have seemed to endanger it.  If it did not, he would\r\nhave been within easy distance of the James River Canal, on the main\r\nline of communication between Lynchburg and the force sent for its\r\ndefence.  I have never taken exception to the operations of General\r\nHunter, and am not now disposed to find fault with him, for I have no\r\ndoubt he acted within what he conceived to be the spirit of his\r\ninstructions and the interests of the service.  The promptitude of his\r\nmovements and his gallantry should entitle him to the commendation of\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Army of the Potomac:  The 2d corps commenced crossing\r\nthe James River on the morning of the 14th by ferry-boats at Wilcox's\r\nLanding.  The laying of the pontoon-bridge was completed about midnight\r\nof the 14th, and the crossing of the balance of the army was rapidly\r\npushed forward by both bridge and ferry.\r\n\r\nAfter the crossing had commenced, I proceeded by steamer to Bermuda\r\nHundred to give the necessary orders for the immediate capture of\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nThe instructions to General Butler were verbal, and were for him to send\r\nGeneral Smith immediately, that night, with all the troops he could give\r\nhim without sacrificing the position he then held.  I told him that I\r\nwould return at once to the Army of the Potomac, hasten its crossing and\r\nthrow it forward to Petersburg by divisions as rapidly as it could be\r\ndone, that we could reinforce our armies more rapidly there than the\r\nenemy could bring troops against us.  General Smith got off as directed,\r\nand confronted the enemy's pickets near Petersburg before daylight next\r\nmorning, but for some reason that I have never been able to\r\nsatisfactorily understand, did not get ready to assault his main lines\r\nuntil near sundown.  Then, with a part of his command only, he made the\r\nassault, and carried the lines north-east of Petersburg from the\r\nAppomattox River, for a distance of over two and a half miles, capturing\r\nfifteen pieces of artillery and three hundred prisoners.  This was about\r\nseven P.M. Between the line thus captured and Petersburg there were no\r\nother works, and there was no evidence that the enemy had reinforced\r\nPetersburg with a single brigade from any source. The night was clear\r\nthe moon shining brightly and favorable to further operations.  General\r\nHancock, with two divisions of the 2d corps, reached General Smith just\r\nafter dark, and offered the service of these troops as he (Smith) might\r\nwish, waiving rank to the named commander, who he naturally supposed\r\nknew best the position of affairs, and what to do with the troops.  But\r\ninstead of taking these troops and pushing at once into Petersburg, he\r\nrequested General Hancock to relieve a part of his line in the captured\r\nworks, which was done before midnight.\r\n\r\nBy the time I arrived the next morning the enemy was in force. An attack\r\nwas ordered to be made at six o'clock that evening by the troops under\r\nSmith and the 2d and 9th corps.  It required until that time for the 9th\r\ncorps to get up and into position. The attack was made as ordered, and\r\nthe fighting continued with but little intermission until six o'clock\r\nthe next morning, and resulted in our carrying the advance and some of\r\nthe main works of the enemy to the right (our left) of those previously\r\ncaptured by General Smith, several pieces of artillery, and over four\r\nhundred prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe 5th corps having got up, the attacks were renewed and persisted in\r\nwith great vigor on the 17th and 18th, but only resulted in forcing the\r\nenemy into an interior line, from which he could not be dislodged.  The\r\nadvantages of position gained by us were very great.  The army then\r\nproceeded to envelop Petersburg towards the South Side Railroad as far\r\nas possible without attacking fortifications.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th the enemy, to reinforce Petersburg, withdrew from a part of\r\nhis intrenchment in front of Bermuda Hundred, expecting, no doubt, to\r\nget troops from north of the James to take the place of those withdrawn\r\nbefore we could discover it.  General Butler, taking advantage of this,\r\nat once moved a force on the railroad between Petersburg and Richmond.\r\nAs soon as I was apprised of the advantage thus gained, to retain it I\r\nordered two divisions of the 6th corps, General Wright commanding, that\r\nwere embarking at Wilcox's Landing, under orders for City Point, to\r\nreport to General Butler at Bermuda Hundred, of which General Butler was\r\nnotified, and the importance of holding a position in advance of his\r\npresent line urged upon him.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock in the afternoon General Butler was forced back to the\r\nline the enemy had withdrawn from in the morning. General Wright, with\r\nhis two divisions, joined General Butler on the forenoon of the 17th,\r\nthe latter still holding with a strong picket-line the enemy's works.\r\nBut instead of putting these divisions into the enemy's works to hold\r\nthem, he permitted them to halt and rest some distance in the rear of\r\nhis own line. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon the enemy\r\nattacked and drove in his pickets and re-occupied his old line.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 20th and morning of the 21st a lodgment was effected\r\nby General Butler, with one brigade of infantry, on the north bank of\r\nthe James, at Deep Bottom, and connected by pontoon-bridge with Bermuda\r\nHundred.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th, General Sheridan, on his return from his expedition against\r\nthe Virginia Central Railroad, arrived at the White House just as the\r\nenemy's cavalry was about to attack it, and compelled it to retire.  The\r\nresult of this expedition was, that General Sheridan met the enemy's\r\ncavalry near Trevilian Station, on the morning of the 11th of June, whom\r\nhe attacked, and after an obstinate contest drove from the field in\r\ncomplete rout.  He left his dead and nearly all his wounded in our\r\nhands, and about four hundred prisoners and several hundred horses.  On\r\nthe 12th he destroyed the railroad from Trevilian Station to Louisa\r\nCourt House.  This occupied until three o'clock P.M., when he advanced\r\nin the direction of Gordonsville.  He found the enemy reinforced by\r\ninfantry, behind well-constructed rifle-pits, about five miles from the\r\nlatter place and too strong to successfully assault.  On the extreme\r\nright, however, his reserve brigade carried the enemy's works twice, and\r\nwas twice driven therefrom by infantry.  Night closed the contest.  Not\r\nhaving sufficient ammunition to continue the engagement, and his animals\r\nbeing without forage (the country furnishing but inferior grazing), and\r\nhearing nothing from General Hunter, he withdrew his command to the\r\nnorth side of the North Anna, and commenced his return march, reaching\r\nWhite House at the time before stated.  After breaking up the depot at\r\nthat place, he moved to the James River, which he reached safely after\r\nheavy fighting.  He commenced crossing on the 25th, near Fort Powhatan,\r\nwithout further molestation, and rejoined the Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d, General Wilson, with his own division of cavalry of the Army\r\nof the Potomac, and General Kautz's division of cavalry of the Army of\r\nthe James moved against the enemy's railroads south of Richmond.\r\nStriking the Weldon Railroad at Reams's Station, destroying the depot\r\nand several miles of the road, and the South Side road about fifteen\r\nmiles from Petersburg, to near Nottoway Station, where he met and\r\ndefeated a force of the enemy's cavalry.  He reached Burkesville Station\r\non the afternoon of the 23d, and from there destroyed the Danville\r\nRailroad to Roanoke Bridge, a distance of twenty-five miles, where he\r\nfound the enemy in force, and in a position from which he could not\r\ndislodge him.  He then commenced his return march, and on the 28th met\r\nthe enemy's cavalry in force at the Weldon Railroad crossing of Stony\r\nCreek, where he had a severe but not decisive engagement.  Thence he\r\nmade a detour from his left with a view of reaching Reams's Station\r\n(supposing it to be in our possession).  At this place he was met by the\r\nenemy's cavalry, supported by infantry, and forced to retire, with the\r\nloss of his artillery and trains.  In this last encounter, General\r\nKautz, with a part of his command, became separated, and made his way\r\ninto our lines.  General Wilson, with the remainder of his force,\r\nsucceeded in crossing the Nottoway River and coming in safely on our\r\nleft and rear.  The damage to the enemy in this expedition more than\r\ncompensated for the losses we sustained.  It severed all connection by\r\nrailroad with Richmond for several weeks.\r\n\r\nWith a view of cutting the enemy's railroad from near Richmond to the\r\nAnna rivers, and making him wary of the situation of his army in the\r\nShenandoah, and, in the event of failure in this, to take advantage of\r\nhis necessary withdrawal of troops from Petersburg, to explode a mine\r\nthat had been prepared in front of the 9th corps and assault the enemy's\r\nlines at that place, on the night of the 26th of July the 2d corps and\r\ntwo divisions of the cavalry corps and Kautz's cavalry were crossed to\r\nthe north bank of the James River and joined the force General Butler\r\nhad there.  On the 27th the enemy was driven from his intrenched\r\nposition, with the loss of four pieces of artillery.  On the 28th our\r\nlines were extended from Deep Bottom to New Market Road, but in getting\r\nthis position were attacked by the enemy in heavy force.  The fighting\r\nlasted for several hours, resulting in considerable loss to both sides.\r\nThe first object of this move having failed, by reason of the very large\r\nforce thrown there by the enemy, I determined to take advantage of the\r\ndiversion made, by assaulting Petersburg before he could get his force\r\nback there.  One division of the 2d corps was withdrawn on the night of\r\nthe 28th, and moved during the night to the rear of the 18th corps, to\r\nrelieve that corps in the line, that it might be foot-loose in the\r\nassault to be made.  The other two divisions of the 2d corps and\r\nSheridan's cavalry were crossed over on the night of the 29th and moved\r\nin front of Petersburg.  On the morning of the 30th, between four and\r\nfive o'clock, the mine was sprung, blowing up a battery and most of a\r\nregiment, and the advance of the assaulting column, formed of the 9th\r\ncorps, immediately took possession of the crater made by the explosion,\r\nand the line for some distance to the right and left of it, and a\r\ndetached line in front of it, but for some cause failed to advance\r\npromptly to the ridge beyond.  Had they done this, I have every reason\r\nto believe that Petersburg would have fallen.  Other troops were\r\nimmediately pushed forward, but the time consumed in getting them up\r\nenabled the enemy to rally from his surprise (which had been complete),\r\nand get forces to this point for its defence.  The captured line thus\r\nheld being untenable, and of no advantage to us, the troops were\r\nwithdrawn, but not without heavy loss.  Thus terminated in disaster what\r\npromised to be the most successful assault of the campaign.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the enemy's ascertaining that General Hunter was\r\nretreating from Lynchburg by way of the Kanawha River, thus laying the\r\nShenandoah Valley open for raid into Maryland and Pennsylvania, he\r\nreturned northward and moved down that valley.  As soon as this movement\r\nof the enemy was ascertained, General Hunter, who had reached the\r\nKanawha River, was directed to move his troops without delay, by river\r\nand railroad, to Harper's Ferry; but owing to the difficulty of\r\nnavigation by reason of low water and breaks in the railroad, great\r\ndelay was experienced in getting there.  It became necessary, therefore,\r\nto find other troops to check this movement of the enemy.  For this\r\npurpose the 6th corps was taken from the armies operating against\r\nRichmond, to which was added the 19th corps, then fortunately beginning\r\nto arrive in Hampton Roads from the Gulf Department, under orders issued\r\nimmediately after the ascertainment of the result of the Red River\r\nexpedition.  The garrisons of Baltimore and Washington were at this time\r\nmade up of heavy-artillery regiments, hundred days' men, and detachments\r\nfrom the invalid corps.  One division under command of General Ricketts,\r\nof the 6th corps, was sent to Baltimore, and the remaining two divisions\r\nof the 6th corps, under General Wright, were subsequently sent to\r\nWashington.  On the 3d of July the enemy approached Martinsburg.\r\nGeneral Sigel, who was in command of our forces there, retreated across\r\nthe Potomac at Shepherdtown; and General Weber, commanding at Harper's\r\nFerry, crossed the occupied Hagerstown, moving a strong column towards\r\nFrederick City.  General Wallace, with Rickett's division and his own\r\ncommand, the latter mostly new and undisciplined troops, pushed out from\r\nBaltimore with great promptness, and met the enemy in force on the\r\nMonocacy, near the crossing of the railroad bridge.  His force was not\r\nsufficient to insure success, but he fought the enemy nevertheless, and\r\nalthough it resulted in a defeat to our arms, yet it detained the enemy,\r\nand thereby served to enable General Wright to reach Washington with two\r\ndivision of the 6th corps, and the advance of the 19th corps, before\r\nhim.  From Monocacy the enemy moved on Washington, his cavalry advance\r\nreaching Rockville on the evening of the 10th.  On the 12th a\r\nreconnoissance was thrown out in front of Fort Stevens, to ascertain the\r\nenemy's position and force.  A severe skirmish ensued, in which we lost\r\nabout two hundred and eighty in killed and wounded.  The enemy's loss\r\nwas probably greater.  He commenced retreating during the night.\r\nLearning the exact condition of affairs at Washington, I requested by\r\ntelegraph, at forty-five minutes past eleven P.M., on the 12th, the\r\nassignment of Major-General H. G. Wright to the command of all the\r\ntroops that could be made available to operate in the field against the\r\nenemy, and directed that he should get outside of the trenches with all\r\nthe force he could, and push Early to the last moment.  General Wright\r\ncommenced the pursuit on the 13th; on the 18th the enemy was overtaken\r\nat Snicker's Ferry, on the Shenandoah, when a sharp skirmish occurred;\r\nand on the 20th, General Averell encountered and defeated a portion of\r\nthe rebel army at Winchester, capturing four pieces of artillery and\r\nseveral hundred prisoners.\r\n\r\nLearning that Early was retreating south towards Lynchburg or Richmond,\r\nI directed that the 6th and 19th corps be got back to the armies\r\noperating against Richmond, so that they might be used in a movement\r\nagainst Lee before the return of the troops sent by him into the valley;\r\nand that Hunter should remain in the Shenandoah Valley, keeping between\r\nany force of the enemy and Washington, acting on the defensive as much\r\nas possible.  I felt that if the enemy had any notion of returning, the\r\nfact would be developed before the 6th and 19th corps could leave\r\nWashington.  Subsequently, the 19th corps was excepted form the order to\r\nreturn to the James.\r\n\r\nAbout the 25th it became evident that the enemy was again advancing upon\r\nMaryland and Pennsylvania, and the 6th corps, then at Washington, was\r\nordered back to the vicinity of Harper's Ferry.  The rebel force moved\r\ndown the valley, and sent a raiding party into Pennsylvania which on the\r\n30th burned Chambersburg, and then retreated, pursued by our cavalry,\r\ntowards Cumberland.  They were met and defeated by General Kelley, and\r\nwith diminished numbers escaped into the mountains of West Virginia.\r\nFrom the time of the first raid the telegraph wires were frequently down\r\nbetween Washington and City Point, making it necessary to transmit\r\nmessages a part of the way by boat.  It took from twenty-four to\r\nthirty-six hours to get dispatches through and return answers would be\r\nreceived showing a different state of facts from those on which they\r\nwere based, causing confusion and apparent contradiction of orders that\r\nmust have considerably embarrassed those who had to execute them, and\r\nrendered operations against the enemy less effective than they otherwise\r\nwould have been. To remedy this evil, it was evident to my mind that\r\nsome person should have the supreme command of all the forces in the\r\nDepartment of West Virginia, Washington, Susquehanna, and the Middle\r\nDepartment, and I so recommended.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of August, I ordered General Sheridan to report in person to\r\nMajor-General Halleck, chief of staff, at Washington, with a view to his\r\nassignment to the command of all the forces against Early.  At this time\r\nthe enemy was concentrated in the neighborhood of Winchester, while our\r\nforces, under General Hunter, were concentrated on the Monocacy, at the\r\ncrossing of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, leaving open to the enemy\r\nWestern Maryland and Southern Pennsylvania.  From where I was, I\r\nhesitated to give positive orders for the movement of our forces at\r\nMonocacy, lest by so doing I should expose Washington. Therefore, on the\r\n4th, I left City Point to visit Hunter's command, and determine for\r\nmyself what was best to be done.  On arrival there, and after\r\nconsultation with General Hunter, I issued to him the following\r\ninstructions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MONOCACY BRIDGE, MARYLAND, August 5, 1864--8 P.M.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:--Concentrate all your available force without delay in the\r\nvicinity of Harper's Ferry, leaving only such railroad guards and\r\ngarrisons for public property as may be necessary.  Use, in this\r\nconcentrating, the railroad, if by so doing time can be saved.  From\r\nHarper's Ferry, if it is found that the enemy has moved north of the\r\nPotomac in large force, push north, following him and attacking him\r\nwherever found; follow him, if driven south of the Potomac, as long as\r\nit is safe to do so.  If it is ascertained that the enemy has but a\r\nsmall force north of the Potomac, then push south with the main force,\r\ndetaching under a competent commander, a sufficient force to look after\r\nthe raiders, and drive them to their homes.  In detaching such a force,\r\nthe brigade of the cavalry now en route from Washington via Rockville\r\nmay be taken into account.\r\n\r\n\"There are now on their way to join you three other brigades of the best\r\ncavalry, numbering at least five thousand men and horses.  These will be\r\ninstructed, in the absence of further orders, to join you by the south\r\nside of the Potomac.  One brigade will probably start to-morrow.  In\r\npushing up the Shenandoah Valley, where it is expected you will have to\r\ngo first or last, it is desirable that nothing should be left to invite\r\nthe enemy to return.  Take all provisions, forage, and stock wanted for\r\nthe use of your command; such as cannot be consumed, destroy.  It is not\r\ndesirable that the buildings should be destroyed--they should rather be\r\nprotected; but the people should be informed that, so long as an army\r\ncan subsist among them, recurrence of theses raids must be expected, and\r\nwe are determined to stop them at all hazards.\r\n\r\n\"Bear in mind, the object is to drive the enemy south; and to do this\r\nyou want to keep him always in sight.  Be guided in your course by the\r\ncourse he takes.\r\n\r\n\"Make your own arrangements for supplies of all kinds, giving regular\r\nvouchers for such as may be taken from loyal citizens in the country\r\nthrough which you march.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL D. HUNTER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe troops were immediately put in motion, and the advance reached\r\nHalltown that night.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hunter having, in our conversation, expressed a willingness to\r\nbe relieved from command, I telegraphed to have General Sheridan, then\r\nat Washington, sent to Harper's Ferry by the morning train, with orders\r\nto take general command of all the troops in the field, and to call on\r\nGeneral Hunter at Monocacy, who would turn over to him my letter of\r\ninstructions.  I remained at Monocacy until General Sheridan arrived, on\r\nthe morning of the 6th, and, after a conference with him in relation to\r\nmilitary affairs in that vicinity, I returned to City Point by way of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of August, the Middle Department, and the Departments of West\r\nVirginia, Washington, and Susquehanna, were constituted into the \"Middle\r\nMilitary Division,\" and  Major-General Sheridan was assigned to\r\ntemporary command of the same.\r\n\r\nTwo divisions of cavalry, commanded by Generals Torbert and Wilson, were\r\nsent to Sheridan from the Army of the Potomac. The first reached him at\r\nHarper's Ferry about the 11th of August.\r\n\r\nHis operations during the month of August and the fore part of September\r\nwere both of an offensive and defensive character, resulting in many\r\nsevere skirmishes, principally by the cavalry, in which we were\r\ngenerally successful, but no general engagement took place.  The two\r\narmies lay in such a position--the enemy on the west bank of the Opequon\r\nCreek covering Winchester, and our forces in front of Berryville--that\r\neither could bring on a battle at any time.  Defeat to us would lay open\r\nto the enemy the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania for long distances\r\nbefore another army could be interposed to check him.  Under these\r\ncircumstances I hesitated about allowing the initiative to be taken.\r\nFinally, the use of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the Chesapeake\r\nand Ohio Canal, which were both obstructed by the enemy, became so\r\nindispensably necessary to us, and the importance of relieving\r\nPennsylvania and Maryland from continuously threatened invasion so\r\ngreat, that I determined the risk should be taken.  But fearing to\r\ntelegraph the order for an attack without knowing more than I did of\r\nGeneral Sheridan's feelings as to what would be the probable result, I\r\nleft City Point on the 15th of September to visit him at his\r\nheadquarters, to decide, after conference with him, what should be done.\r\nI met him at Charlestown, and he pointed out so distinctly how each army\r\nlay; what he could do the moment he was authorized, and expressed such\r\nconfidence of success, that I saw there were but two words of\r\ninstructions necessary--Go in!  For the conveniences of forage, the\r\nteams for supplying the army were kept at Harper's Ferry.  I asked him\r\nif he could get out his teams and supplies in time to make an attack on\r\nthe ensuing Tuesday morning.  His reply was, that he could before\r\ndaylight on Monday.  He was off promptly to time, and I may here add,\r\nthat the result was such that I have never since deemed it necessary to\r\nvisit General Sheridan before giving him orders.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 19th, General Sheridan attacked General\r\nEarly at the crossing on the Opequon Creek, and after a most sanguinary\r\nand bloody battle, lasting until five o'clock in the evening, defeated\r\nhim with heavy loss, carrying his entire position from Opequon Creek to\r\nWinchester, capturing several thousand prisoners and five pieces of\r\nartillery.  The enemy rallied, and made a stand in a strong position at\r\nFisher's Hill, where he was attacked, and again defeated with heavy loss\r\non the 20th [22d].  Sheridan pursued him with great energy through\r\nHarrisonburg, Staunton, and the gaps of the Blue Ridge.  After stripping\r\nthe upper valley of most of the supplies and provisions for the rebel\r\narmy, he returned to Strasburg, and took position on the north side of\r\nCedar Creek.\r\n\r\nHaving received considerable reinforcements, General Early again\r\nreturned to the valley, and, on the 9th of October, his cavalry\r\nencountered ours near Strasburg, where the rebels were defeated, with\r\nthe loss of eleven pieces of artillery and three hundred and fifty\r\nprisoners.  On the night of the 18th, the enemy crossed the mountains\r\nwhich separate the branches of the Shenandoah, forded the North Fork,\r\nand early on the morning of the 19th, under cover of the darkness and\r\nthe fog, surprised and turned our left flank, and captured the batteries\r\nwhich enfiladed our whole line.  Our troops fell back with heavy loss\r\nand in much confusion, but were finally rallied between Middletown and\r\nNewtown.  At this juncture, General Sheridan, who was at Winchester when\r\nthe battle commenced arrived on the field, arranged his lines just in\r\ntime to repulse a heavy attack of the enemy, and immediately assuming\r\nthe offensive, he attacked in turn with great vigor.  The enemy was\r\ndefeated with great slaughter, and the loss of most of his artillery and\r\ntrains, and the trophies he had captured in the morning.  The wreck of\r\nhis army escaped during the night, and fled in the direction of Staunton\r\nand Lynchburg.  Pursuit was made to Mount Jackson. Thus ended this, the\r\nenemy's last attempt to invade the North via the Shenandoah Valley.  I\r\nwas now enabled to return the 6th corps to the Army of the Potomac, and\r\nto send one division from Sheridan's army to the Army of the James, and\r\nanother to Savannah, Georgia, to hold Sherman's new acquisitions on the\r\nsea-coast, and thus enable him to move without detaching from his force\r\nfor that purpose.\r\n\r\nReports from various sources led me to believe that the enemy had\r\ndetached three divisions from Petersburg to reinforce Early in the\r\nShenandoah Valley.  I therefore sent the 2d corps and Gregg's division\r\nof cavalry, of the Army of the Potomac, and a force of General Butler's\r\narmy, on the night of the 13th of August, to threaten Richmond from the\r\nnorth side of the James, to prevent him from sending troops away, and,\r\nif possible, to draw back those sent.  In this move we captured six\r\npieces of artillery and several hundred prisoners, detained troops that\r\nwere under marching orders, and ascertained that but one division\r\n(Kershaw's), of the three reputed detached, had gone.\r\n\r\nThe enemy having withdrawn heavily from Petersburg to resist this\r\nmovement, the 5th corps, General Warren commanding, was moved out on the\r\n18th, and took possession of the Weldon Railroad.  During the day he had\r\nconsiderable fighting.  To regain possession of the road, the enemy made\r\nrepeated and desperate assaults, but was each time repulsed with great\r\nloss.  On the night of the 20th, the troops on the north side of the\r\nJames were withdrawn, and Hancock and Gregg returned to the front at\r\nPetersburg.  On the 25th, the 2d corps and Gregg's division of cavalry,\r\nwhile at Reams's Station destroying the railroad, were attacked, and\r\nafter desperate fighting, a part of our line gave way, and five pieces\r\nof artillery fell into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nBy the 12th of September, a branch railroad was completed from the City\r\nPoint and Petersburg Railroad to the Weldon Railroad, enabling us to\r\nsupply, without difficulty, in all weather, the army in front of\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nThe extension of our lines across the Weldon Railroad compelled the\r\nenemy to so extend his, that it seemed he could have but few troops\r\nnorth of the James for the defence of Richmond.  On the night of the\r\n28th, the 10th corps, Major-General Birney, and the 18th corps,\r\nMajor-General Ord commanding, of General Butler's army, were crossed to\r\nthe north side of the James, and advanced on the morning of the 29th,\r\ncarrying the very strong fortifications and intrenchments below\r\nChaffin's Farm, known as Fort Harrison, capturing fifteen pieces of\r\nartillery, and the New Market Road and intrenchments.  This success was\r\nfollowed up by a gallant assault upon Fort Gilmer, immediately in front\r\nof the Chaffin Farm fortifications, in which we were repulsed with heavy\r\nloss.  Kautz's cavalry was pushed forward on the road to the right of\r\nthis, supported by infantry, and reached the enemy's inner line, but was\r\nunable to get further.  The position captured from the enemy was so\r\nthreatening to Richmond, that I determined to hold it.  The enemy made\r\nseveral desperate attempts to dislodge us, all of which were\r\nunsuccessful, and for which he paid dearly.  On the morning of the 30th,\r\nGeneral Meade sent out a reconnoissance with a view to attacking the\r\nenemy's line, if it was found sufficiently weakened by withdrawal of\r\ntroops to the north side.  In this reconnoissance we captured and held\r\nthe enemy's works near Poplar Spring Church.  In the afternoon, troops\r\nmoving to get to the left of the point gained were attacked by the enemy\r\nin heavy force, and compelled to fall back until supported by the forces\r\nholding the captured works. Our cavalry under Gregg was also attacked,\r\nbut repulsed the enemy with great loss.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of October, the enemy attacked Kautz's cavalry north of the\r\nJames, and drove it back with heavy loss in killed, wounded, and\r\nprisoners, and the loss of all the artillery eight or nine pieces.  This\r\nhe followed up by an attack on our intrenched infantry line, but was\r\nrepulsed with severe slaughter.  On the 13th, a reconnoissance was sent\r\nout by General Butler, with a view to drive the enemy from some new\r\nworks he was constructing, which resulted in very heavy loss to us.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th, the Army of the Potomac, leaving only sufficient men to\r\nhold its fortified line, moved by the enemy's right flank.  The 2d\r\ncorps, followed by two divisions of the 5th corps, with the cavalry in\r\nadvance and covering our left flank, forced a passage of Hatcher's Run,\r\nand moved up the south side of it towards the South Side Railroad, until\r\nthe 2d corps and part of the cavalry reached the Boydton Plank Road\r\nwhere it crosses Hatcher's Run.  At this point we were six miles distant\r\nfrom the South Side Railroad, which I had hoped by this movement to\r\nreach and hold.  But finding that we had not reached the end of the\r\nenemy's fortifications, and no place presenting itself for a successful\r\nassault by which he might be doubled up and shortened, I determined to\r\nwithdraw to within our fortified line.  Orders were given accordingly.\r\nImmediately upon receiving a report that General Warren had connected\r\nwith General Hancock, I returned to my headquarters.  Soon after I left\r\nthe enemy moved out across Hatcher's Run, in the gap between Generals\r\nHancock and Warren, which was not closed as reported, and made a\r\ndesperate attack on General Hancock's right and rear.  General Hancock\r\nimmediately faced his corps to meet it, and after a bloody combat drove\r\nthe enemy within his works, and withdrew that night to his old position.\r\n\r\nIn support of this movement, General Butler made a demonstration on the\r\nnorth side of the James, and attacked the enemy on the Williamsburg\r\nRoad, and also on the York River Railroad.  In the former he was\r\nunsuccessful; in the latter he succeeded in carrying a work which was\r\nafterwards abandoned, and his forces withdrawn to their former\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the operations in front of Petersburg and\r\nRichmond, until the spring campaign of 1865, were confined to the\r\ndefence and extension of our lines, and to offensive movements for\r\ncrippling the enemy's lines of communication, and to prevent his\r\ndetaching any considerable force to send south.  By the 7th of February,\r\nour lines were extended to Hatcher's Run, and the Weldon Railroad had\r\nbeen destroyed to Hicksford.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman moved from Chattanooga on the 6th of May, with the\r\nArmies of the Cumberland, Tennessee, and Ohio, commanded, respectively,\r\nby Generals Thomas McPherson, and Schofield, upon Johnston's army at\r\nDalton; but finding the enemy's position at Buzzard's Roost, covering\r\nDalton, too strong to be assaulted, General McPherson was sent through\r\nSnake Gap to turn it, while Generals Thomas and Schofield threatened it\r\nin front and on the north.  This movement was successful.  Johnston,\r\nfinding his retreat likely to be cut off, fell back to his fortified\r\nposition at Resaca, where he was attacked on the afternoon of May 15th.\r\nA heavy battle ensued.  During the night the enemy retreated south.\r\nLate on the 17th, his rear-guard was overtaken near Adairsville, and\r\nheavy skirmishing followed.  The next morning, however, he had again\r\ndisappeared.  He was vigorously pursued, and was overtaken at Cassville\r\non the 19th, but during the ensuing night retreated across the Etowah.\r\nWhile these operations were going on, General Jefferson C. Davis's\r\ndivision of Thomas's army was sent to Rome, capturing it with its forts\r\nand artillery, and its valuable mills and foundries.  General Sherman,\r\nhaving give his army a few days' rest at this point, again put it in\r\nmotion on the 23d, for Dallas, with a view of turning the difficult pass\r\nat Allatoona.  On the afternoon of the 25th, the advance, under General\r\nHooker, had a severe battle with the enemy, driving him back to New Hope\r\nChurch, near Dallas.  Several sharp encounters occurred at this point.\r\nThe most important was on the 28th, when the enemy assaulted General\r\nMcPherson at Dallas, but received a terrible and bloody repulse.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of June, Johnston abandoned his intrenched position at New\r\nHope Church, and retreated to the strong positions of Kenesaw, Pine, and\r\nLost mountains.  He was forced to yield the two last-named places, and\r\nconcentrate his army on Kenesaw, where, on the 27th, Generals Thomas and\r\nMcPherson made a determined but unsuccessful assault.  On the night of\r\nthe 2d of July, Sherman commenced moving his army by the right flank,\r\nand on the morning of the 3d, found that the enemy, in consequence of\r\nthis movement, had abandoned Kenesaw and retreated across the\r\nChattahoochee.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman remained on the Chattahoochee to give his men rest and\r\nget up stores until the 17th of July, when he resumed his operations,\r\ncrossed the Chattahoochee, destroyed a large portion of the railroad to\r\nAugusta, and drove the enemy back to Atlanta. At this place General Hood\r\nsucceeded General Johnston in command of the rebel army, and assuming\r\nthe offensive-defensive policy, made several severe attacks upon Sherman\r\nin the vicinity of Atlanta, the most desperate and determined of which\r\nwas on the 22d of July.  About one P.M. of this day the brave,\r\naccomplished, and noble-hearted McPherson was killed.  General Logan\r\nsucceeded him, and commanded the Army of the Tennessee through this\r\ndesperate battle, and until he was superseded by Major-General Howard,\r\non the 26th, with the same success and ability that had characterized\r\nhim in the command of a corps or division.\r\n\r\nIn all these attacks the enemy was repulsed with great loss. Finding it\r\nimpossible to entirely invest the place, General Sherman, after securing\r\nhis line of communications across the Chattahoochee, moved his main\r\nforce round by the enemy's left flank upon the Montgomery and Macon\r\nroads, to draw the enemy from his fortifications.  In this he succeeded,\r\nand after defeating the enemy near Rough-and-Ready, Jonesboro, and\r\nLovejoy's, forcing him to retreat to the south, on the 2d of September\r\noccupied Atlanta, the objective point of his campaign.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of this move, the rebel cavalry, under Wheeler, attempted\r\nto cut his communications in the rear, but was repulsed at Dalton, and\r\ndriven into East Tennessee, whence it proceeded west to McMinnville,\r\nMurfreesboro, and Franklin, and was finally driven south of the\r\nTennessee.  The damage done by this raid was repaired in a few days.\r\n\r\nDuring the partial investment of Atlanta, General Rousseau joined\r\nGeneral Sherman with a force of cavalry from Decatur, having made a\r\nsuccessful raid upon the Atlanta and Montgomery Railroad, and its\r\nbranches near Opelika. Cavalry raids were also made by Generals McCook,\r\nGarrard, and Stoneman, to cut the remaining Railroad communication with\r\nAtlanta.  The first two were successful the latter, disastrous.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman's movement from Chattanooga to Atlanta was prompt,\r\nskilful, and brilliant.  The history of his flank movements and battles\r\nduring that memorable campaign will ever be read with an interest\r\nunsurpassed by anything in history.\r\n\r\nHis own report, and those of his subordinate commanders, accompanying\r\nit, give the details of that most successful campaign.\r\n\r\nHe was dependent for the supply of his armies upon a single-track\r\nrailroad from Nashville to the point where he was operating.  This\r\npassed the entire distance through a hostile country, and every foot of\r\nit had to be protected by troops. The cavalry force of the enemy under\r\nForrest, in Northern Mississippi, was evidently waiting for Sherman to\r\nadvance far enough into the mountains of Georgia, to make a retreat\r\ndisastrous, to get upon this line and destroy it beyond the possibility\r\nof further use.  To guard against this danger, Sherman left what he\r\nsupposed to be a sufficient force to operate against Forrest in West\r\nTennessee.  He directed General Washburn, who commanded there, to send\r\nBrigadier-General S. D. Sturgis in command of this force to attack him.\r\nOn the morning of the 10th of June, General Sturgis met the enemy near\r\nGuntown, Mississippi, was badly beaten, and driven back in utter rout\r\nand confusion to Memphis, a distance of about one hundred miles, hotly\r\npursued by the enemy.  By this, however, the enemy was defeated in his\r\ndesigns upon Sherman's line of communications. The persistency with\r\nwhich he followed up this success exhausted him, and made a season for\r\nrest and repairs necessary.  In the meantime, Major-General A. J. Smith,\r\nwith the troops of the Army of the Tennessee that had been sent by\r\nGeneral Sherman to General Banks, arrived at Memphis on their return\r\nfrom Red River, where they had done most excellent service.  He was\r\ndirected by General Sherman to immediately take the offensive against\r\nForrest.  This he did with the promptness and effect which has\r\ncharacterized his whole military career.  On the 14th of July, he met\r\nthe enemy at Tupelo, Mississippi, and whipped him badly.  The fighting\r\ncontinued through three days.  Our loss was small compared with that of\r\nthe enemy.  Having accomplished the object of his expedition, General\r\nSmith returned to Memphis.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of March and April this same force under Forrest\r\nannoyed us considerably.  On the 24th of March it captured Union City,\r\nKentucky, and its garrison, and on the 24th attacked Paducah, commanded\r\nby Colonel S. G. Hicks, 40th Illinois Volunteers.  Colonel H., having\r\nbut a small force, withdrew to the forts near the river, from where he\r\nrepulsed the enemy and drove him from the place.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of April, part of this force, under the rebel General\r\nBuford, summoned the garrison of Columbus, Kentucky, to surrender, but\r\nreceived for reply from Colonel Lawrence, 34th New Jersey Volunteers,\r\nthat being placed there by his Government with adequate force to hold\r\nhis post and repel all enemies from it, surrender was out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the same day Forrest attacked Fort Pillow, Tennessee,\r\ngarrisoned by a detachment of Tennessee cavalry and the 1st Regiment\r\nAlabama colored troops, commanded by Major Booth.  The garrison fought\r\nbravely until about three o'clock in the afternoon, when the enemy\r\ncarried the works by assault; and, after our men threw down their arms,\r\nproceeded to an inhuman and merciless massacre of the garrison.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, General Buford, having failed at Columbus, appeared before\r\nPaducah, but was again driven off.\r\n\r\nGuerillas and raiders, seemingly emboldened by Forrest's operations,\r\nwere also very active in Kentucky.  The most noted of these was Morgan.\r\nWith a force of from two to three thousand cavalry, he entered the State\r\nthrough Pound Gap in the latter part of May.  On the 11th of June they\r\nattacked and captured Cynthiana, with its entire garrison.  On the 12th\r\nhe was overtaken by General Burbridge, and completely routed with heavy\r\nloss, and was finally driven out of the State.  This notorious guerilla\r\nwas afterwards surprised and killed near Greenville, Tennessee, and his\r\ncommand captured and dispersed by General Gillem.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of official reports of the commencement of the Red River\r\nexpedition, except so far as relates to the movements of the troops sent\r\nby General Sherman under General A. J. Smith, I am unable to give the\r\ndate of its starting.  The troops under General Smith, comprising two\r\ndivisions of the 16th and a detachment of the 17th army corps, left\r\nVicksburg on the 10th of March, and reached the designated point on Red\r\nRiver one day earlier than that appointed by General Banks.  The rebel\r\nforces at Fort de Russy, thinking to defeat him, left the fort on the\r\n14th to give him battle in the open field; but, while occupying the\r\nenemy with skirmishing and demonstrations, Smith pushed forward to Fort\r\nde Russy, which had been left with a weak garrison, and captured it with\r\nits garrison about three hundred and fifty men, eleven pieces of\r\nartillery, and many small-arms.  Our loss was but slight.  On the 15th\r\nhe pushed forward to Alexandria, which place he reached on the 18th.  On\r\nthe 21st he had an engagement with the enemy at Henderson's Hill, in\r\nwhich he defeated him, capturing two hundred and ten prisoners and four\r\npieces of artillery.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, he again attacked and defeated the enemy under the rebel\r\nGeneral Taylor, at Cane River.  By the 26th, General Banks had assembled\r\nhis whole army at Alexandria, and pushed forward to Grand Ecore.  On the\r\nmorning of April 6th he moved from Grand Ecore.  On the afternoon of the\r\n7th, he advanced and met the enemy near Pleasant Hill, and drove him\r\nfrom the field.  On the same afternoon the enemy made a stand eight\r\nmiles beyond Pleasant Hill, but was again compelled to retreat.  On the\r\n8th, at Sabine Cross Roads and Peach Hill, the enemy attacked and\r\ndefeated his advance, capturing nineteen pieces of artillery and an\r\nimmense amount of transportation and stores.  During the night, General\r\nBanks fell back to Pleasant Hill, where another battle was fought on the\r\n9th, and the enemy repulsed with great loss.  During the night, General\r\nBanks continued his retrograde movement to Grand Ecore, and thence to\r\nAlexandria, which he reached on the 27th of April.  Here a serious\r\ndifficulty arose in getting Admiral Porter's fleet which accompanied the\r\nexpedition, over the rapids, the water having fallen so much since they\r\npassed up as to prevent their return.  At the suggestion of Colonel (now\r\nBrigadier-General) Bailey, and under his superintendence, wing-dams were\r\nconstructed, by which the channel was contracted so that the fleet\r\npassed down the rapids in safety.\r\n\r\nThe army evacuated Alexandria on the 14th of May, after considerable\r\nskirmishing with the enemy's advance, and reached Morganzia and Point\r\nCoupee near the end of the month.  The disastrous termination of this\r\nexpedition, and the lateness of the season, rendered impracticable the\r\ncarrying out of my plans of a movement in force sufficient to insure the\r\ncapture of Mobile.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of March, Major-General Steele left Little Rock with the 7th\r\narmy corps, to  cooperate with General Banks's expedition on the Red\r\nRiver, and reached Arkadelphia on the 28th.  On the 16th of April, after\r\ndriving the enemy before him, he was joined, near Elkin's Ferry, in\r\nWashita County, by General Thayer, who had marched from Fort Smith.\r\nAfter several severe skirmishes, in which the enemy was defeated,\r\nGeneral Steele reached Camden, which he occupied about the middle of\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nOn learning the defeat and consequent retreat of General Banks on Red\r\nRiver, and the loss of one of his own trains at Mark's Mill, in Dallas\r\nCounty, General Steele determined to fall back to the Arkansas River.\r\nHe left Camden on the 26th of April, and reached Little Rock on the 2d\r\nof May.  On the 30th of April, the enemy attacked him while crossing\r\nSaline River at Jenkins's Ferry, but was repulsed with considerable\r\nloss.  Our loss was about six hundred in killed, wounded and prisoners.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Canby, who had been assigned to the command of the\r\n\"Military Division of the West Mississippi,\" was therefore directed to\r\nsend the 19th army corps to join the armies operating against Richmond,\r\nand to limit the remainder of his command to such operations as might be\r\nnecessary to hold the positions and lines of communications he then\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\nBefore starting General A. J. Smith's troops back to Sherman, General\r\nCanby sent a part of it to disperse a force of the enemy that was\r\ncollecting near the Mississippi River.  General Smith met and defeated\r\nthis force near Lake Chicot on the 5th of June.  Our loss was about\r\nforty killed and seventy wounded.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of July, General Canby sent Major-General Gordon\r\nGranger, with such forces as he could collect, to co-operate with\r\nAdmiral Farragut against the defences of Mobile Bay.  On the 8th of\r\nAugust, Fort Gaines surrendered to the combined naval and land forces.\r\nFort Powell was blown up and abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th, Fort Morgan was invested, and, after a severe bombardment,\r\nsurrendered on the 23d.  The total captures amounted to one thousand\r\nfour hundred and sixty-four prisoners, and one hundred and four pieces\r\nof artillery.\r\n\r\nAbout the last of August, it being reported that the rebel General\r\nPrice, with a force of about ten thousand men, had reached Jacksonport,\r\non his way to invade Missouri, General A. J. Smith's command, then en\r\nroute from Memphis to join Sherman, was ordered to Missouri.  A cavalry\r\nforce was also, at the same time, sent from Memphis, under command of\r\nColonel Winslow.  This made General Rosecrans's forces superior to those\r\nof Price, and no doubt was entertained he would be able to check Price\r\nand drive him back; while the forces under General Steele, in Arkansas,\r\nwould cut off his retreat.  On the 26th day of September, Price attacked\r\nPilot Knob and forced the garrison to retreat, and thence moved north to\r\nthe Missouri River, and continued up that river towards Kansas.  General\r\nCurtis, commanding Department of Kansas, immediately collected such\r\nforces as he could to repel the invasion of Kansas, while General\r\nRosecrans's cavalry was operating in his rear.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was brought to battle on the Big Blue and defeated, with the\r\nloss of nearly all his artillery and trains and a large number of\r\nprisoners.  He made a precipitate retreat to Northern Arkansas.  The\r\nimpunity with which Price was enabled to roam over the State of Missouri\r\nfor a long time, and the incalculable mischief done by him, show to how\r\nlittle purpose a superior force may be used.  There is no reason why\r\nGeneral Rosecrans should not have concentrated his forces, and beaten\r\nand driven Price before the latter reached Pilot Knob.\r\n\r\nSeptember 20th, the enemy's cavalry, under Forrest, crossed the\r\nTennessee near Waterloo, Alabama, and on the 23d attacked the garrison\r\nat Athens, consisting of six hundred men, which capitulated on the 24th.\r\nSoon after the surrender two regiments of reinforcements arrived, and\r\nafter a severe fight were compelled to surrender.  Forrest destroyed the\r\nrailroad westward, captured the garrison at Sulphur Branch trestle,\r\nskirmished with the garrison at Pulaski on the 27th, and on the same day\r\ncut the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad near Tullahoma and Dechard.\r\nOn the morning of the 30th, one column of Forrest's command, under\r\nBuford, appeared before Huntsville, and summoned the surrender of the\r\ngarrison.  Receiving an answer in the negative, he remained in the\r\nvicinity of the place until next morning, when he again summoned its\r\nsurrender, and received the same reply as on the night before.  He\r\nwithdrew in the direction of Athens which place had been regarrisoned,\r\nand attacked it on the afternoon of the 1st of October, but without\r\nsuccess.  On the morning of the 2d he renewed his attack, but was\r\nhandsomely repulsed.\r\n\r\nAnother column under Forrest appeared before Columbia on the morning of\r\nthe 1st, but did not make an attack.  On the morning of the 3d he moved\r\ntowards Mount Pleasant.  While these operations were going on, every\r\nexertion was made by General Thomas to destroy the forces under Forrest\r\nbefore he could recross the Tennessee, but was unable to prevent his\r\nescape to Corinth, Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIn September, an expedition under General Burbridge was sent to destroy\r\nthe saltworks at Saltville, Virginia. He met the enemy on the 2d of\r\nOctober, about three miles and a half from Saltville, and drove him into\r\nhis strongly intrenched position around the salt-works, from which he\r\nwas unable to dislodge him.  During the night he withdrew his command\r\nand returned to Kentucky.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman, immediately after the fall of Atlanta, put his armies\r\nin camp in and about the place, and made all preparations for refitting\r\nand supplying them for future service.  The great length of road from\r\nAtlanta to the Cumberland River, however, which had to be guarded,\r\nallowed the troops but little rest.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Jefferson Davis made a speech in Macon, Georgia, which\r\nwas reported in the papers of the South, and soon became known to the\r\nwhole country, disclosing the plans of the enemy, thus enabling General\r\nSherman to fully meet them.  He exhibited the weakness of supposing that\r\nan army that had been beaten and fearfully decimated in a vain attempt\r\nat the defensive, could successfully undertake the offensive against the\r\narmy that had so often defeated it.\r\n\r\nIn execution of this plan, Hood, with this army, was soon reported to\r\nthe south-west of Atlanta. Moving far to Sherman's right, he succeeded\r\nin reaching the railroad about Big Shanty, and moved north on it.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman, leaving a force to hold Atlanta, with the remainder of\r\nhis army fell upon him and drove him to Gadsden, Alabama. Seeing the\r\nconstant annoyance he would have with the roads to his rear if he\r\nattempted to hold Atlanta, General Sherman proposed the abandonment and\r\ndestruction of that place, with all the railroads leading to it, and\r\ntelegraphed me as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CENTREVILLE, GEORGIA\", October 10--noon.\r\n\r\n\"Dispatch about Wilson just received.  Hood is now crossing Coosa River,\r\ntwelve miles below Rome, bound west.  If he passes over the Mobile and\r\nOhio road, had I not better execute the plan of my letter sent by\r\nColonel Porter, and leave General Thomas with the troops now in\r\nTennessee to defend the State?  He will have an ample force when the\r\nreinforcements ordered reach Nashville.\r\n\r\n\"W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.\r\n\"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a full understanding of the plan referred to in this dispatch, I\r\nquote from the letter sent by Colonel Porter:\r\n\r\n\"I will therefore give my opinion, that your army and Canby's should be\r\nreinforced to the maximum; that after you get Wilmington, you strike for\r\nSavannah and the river; that Canby be instructed to hold the Mississippi\r\nRiver, and send a force to get Columbus, Georgia, either by the way of\r\nthe Alabama or the Appalachicola, and that I keep Hood employed and put\r\nmy army in final order for a march on Augusta, Columbia, and Charleston,\r\nto be ready as soon as Wilmington is sealed as to commerce and the city\r\nof Savannah is in our possession.\"  This was in reply to a letter of\r\nmine of date September 12th, in answer to a dispatch of his containing\r\nsubstantially the same proposition, and in which I informed him of a\r\nproposed movement against Wilmington, and of the situation in Virginia,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA,\r\n\r\n\"October 11, 1864--11 A.M.\r\n\r\n\"Your dispatch of October 10th received.  Does it not look as if Hood\r\nwas going to attempt the invasion of Middle Tennessee, using the Mobile\r\nand Ohio and Memphis and Charleston roads to supply his base on the\r\nTennessee River, about Florence or Decatur?  If he does this, he ought\r\nto be met and prevented from getting north of the Tennessee River.  If\r\nyou were to cut loose, I do not believe you would meet Hood's army, but\r\nwould be bushwhacked by all the old men and little boys, and such\r\nrailroad guards as are still left at home.  Hood would probably strike\r\nfor Nashville, thinking that by going north he could inflict greater\r\ndamage upon us than we could upon the rebels by going south.  If there\r\nis any way of getting at Hood's army, I would prefer that, but I must\r\ntrust to your own judgment.  I find I shall not be able to send a force\r\nfrom here to act with you on Savannah. Your movements, therefore, will\r\nbe independent of mine; at least until the fall of Richmond takes place.\r\nI am afraid Thomas, with such lines of road as he has to protect, could\r\nnot prevent Hood from going north.  With Wilson turned loose, with all\r\nyour cavalry, you will find the rebels put much more on the defensive\r\nthan heretofore.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"KINGSTON, GEORGIA, \"October 11--11 A.M.\r\n\r\n\"Hood moved his army from Palmetto Station across by Dallas and\r\nCedartown, and is now on the Coosa River, south of Rome.  He threw one\r\ncorps on my road at Acworth, and I was forced to follow.  I hold Atlanta\r\nwith the 20th corps, and have strong detachments along my line.  This\r\nreduces my active force to a comparatively small army.  We cannot remain\r\nhere on the defensive.  With the twenty-five thousand men, and the bold\r\ncavalry he has, he can constantly break my roads.  I would infinitely\r\nprefer to make a wreck of the road, and of the country from Chattanooga\r\nto Atlanta including the latter city send back all my wounded and\r\nworthless, and with my effective army, move through Georgia, smashing\r\nthings, to the sea. Hood may turn into Tennessee and Kentucky, but I\r\nbelieve he will be forced to follow me.  Instead of my being on the\r\ndefensive, I would be on the offensive; instead of guessing at what he\r\nmeans to do, he would have to guess at my plans.  The difference in war\r\nis full twenty-five per cent.  I can make Savannah, Charleston, or the\r\nmouth of the Chattahoochee.\r\n\r\n\"Answer quick, as I know we will not have the telegraph long.\r\n\r\n\"W. T.

If you are satisfied the trip to the\r\nsea-coast can be made, holding the line of the Tennessee River firmly,\r\nyou may make it, destroying all the railroad south of Dalton or\r\nChattanooga, as you think best.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the original design to hold Atlanta, and by getting through to\r\nthe coast, with a garrison left on the southern railroads, leading east\r\nand west, through Georgia, to effectually sever the east from the west.\r\nIn other words, cut the would-be Confederacy in two again, as it had\r\nbeen cut once by our gaining possession of the Mississippi River.\r\nGeneral Sherman's plan virtually effected this object.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman commenced at once his preparations for his proposed\r\nmovement, keeping his army in position in the meantime to watch Hood.\r\nBecoming satisfied that Hood had moved westward from Gadsden across Sand\r\nMountain, General Sherman sent the 4th corps,  Major-General Stanley\r\ncommanding, and the 23d corps, Major-General Schofield commanding, back\r\nto Chattanooga to report to Major-General Thomas, at Nashville, whom he\r\nhad placed in command of all the troops of his military division, save\r\nthe four army corps and cavalry division he designed to move with\r\nthrough Georgia. With the troops thus left at his disposal, there was\r\nlittle doubt that General Thomas could hold the line of the Tennessee,\r\nor, in the event Hood should force it, would be able to concentrate and\r\nbeat him in battle.  It was therefore readily consented to that Sherman\r\nshould start for the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nHaving concentrated his troops at Atlanta by the 14th of November, he\r\ncommenced his march, threatening both Augusta and Macon.  His coming-out\r\npoint could not be definitely fixed. Having to gather his subsistence as\r\nhe marched through the country, it was not impossible that a force\r\ninferior to his own might compel him to head for such point as he could\r\nreach, instead of such as he might prefer.  The blindness of the enemy,\r\nhowever, in ignoring his movement, and sending Hood's army, the only\r\nconsiderable force he had west of Richmond and east of the Mississippi\r\nRiver, northward on an offensive campaign, left the whole country open,\r\nand Sherman's route to his own choice.\r\n\r\nHow that campaign was conducted, how little opposition was met with, the\r\ncondition of the country through which the armies passed, the capture of\r\nFort McAllister, on the Savannah River, and the occupation of Savannah\r\non the 21st of December, are all clearly set forth in General Sherman's\r\nadmirable report.\r\n\r\nSoon after General Sherman commenced his march from Atlanta, two\r\nexpeditions, one from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and one from Vicksburg,\r\nMississippi, were started by General Canby to cut the enemy's lines of\r\ncommunication with Mobile and detain troops in that field.  General\r\nFoster, commanding Department of the South, also sent an expedition, via\r\nBroad River, to destroy the railroad between Charleston and Savannah.\r\nThe expedition from Vicksburg, under command of Brevet Brigadier-General\r\nE. D. Osband (colonel 3d United States colored cavalry), captured, on\r\nthe 27th of November, and destroyed the Mississippi Central Railroad\r\nbridge and trestle-work over Big Black River, near Canton, thirty miles\r\nof the road, and two locomotives, besides large amounts of stores.  The\r\nexpedition from Baton Rouge was without favorable results.  The\r\nexpedition from the Department of the South, under the immediate command\r\nof Brigadier-General John P. Hatch, consisting of about five thousand\r\nmen of all arms, including a brigade from the navy, proceeded up Broad\r\nRiver and debarked at Boyd's Neck on the 29th of November, from where it\r\nmoved to strike the railroad at Grahamsville.  At Honey Hill, about\r\nthree miles from Grahamsville, the enemy was found and attacked in a\r\nstrongly fortified position, which resulted, after severe fighting, in\r\nour repulse with a loss of seven hundred and forty-six in killed,\r\nwounded, and missing.  During the night General Hatch withdrew.  On the\r\n6th of December General Foster obtained a position covering the\r\nCharleston and Savannah Railroad, between the Coosawhatchie and\r\nTulifinny rivers.\r\n\r\nHood, instead of following Sherman, continued his move northward, which\r\nseemed to me to be leading to his certain doom.  At all events, had I\r\nhad the power to command both armies, I should not have changed the\r\norders under which he seemed to be acting.  On the 26th of October, the\r\nadvance of Hood's army attacked the garrison at Decatur, Alabama, but\r\nfailing to carry the place, withdrew towards Courtland, and succeeded,\r\nin the face of our cavalry, in effecting a lodgment on the north side of\r\nthe Tennessee River, near Florence.  On the 28th, Forrest reached the\r\nTennessee, at Fort Heiman, and captured a gunboat and three transports.\r\nOn the 2d of November he planted batteries above and below Johnsonville,\r\non the opposite side of the river, isolating three gunboats and eight\r\ntransports.  On the 4th the enemy opened his batteries upon the place,\r\nand was replied to from the gunboats and the garrison.  The gunboats\r\nbecoming disabled were set on fire, as also were the transports, to\r\nprevent their falling into the hands of the enemy.  About a million and\r\na half dollars' worth of store and property on the levee and in\r\nstorehouses was consumed by fire.  On the 5th the enemy disappeared and\r\ncrossed to the north side of the Tennessee River, above Johnsonville,\r\nmoving towards Clifton, and subsequently joined Hood.  On the night of\r\nthe 5th, General Schofield, with the advance of the 23d corps, reached\r\nJohnsonville, but finding the enemy gone, was ordered to Pulaski, and\r\nwas put in command of all the troopers there, with instruction to watch\r\nthe movements of Hood and retard his advance, but not to risk a general\r\nengagement until the arrival of General A. J. Smith's command from\r\nMissouri, and until General Wilson could get his cavalry remounted.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th, General Hood continued his advance.  General Thomas,\r\nretarding him as much as possible, fell back towards Nashville for the\r\npurpose of concentrating his command and gaining time for the arrival of\r\nreinforcements.  The enemy coming up with our main force, commanded by\r\nGeneral Schofield, at Franklin, on the 30th, assaulted our works\r\nrepeatedly during the afternoon until late at night, but were in every\r\ninstance repulsed.  His loss in this battle was one thousand seven\r\nhundred and fifty killed, seven hundred and two prisoners, and three\r\nthousand eight hundred wounded.  Among his losses were six general\r\nofficers killed, six wounded, and one captured.  Our entire loss was two\r\nthousand three hundred.  This was the first serious opposition the enemy\r\nmet with, and I am satisfied was the fatal blow to all his expectations.\r\nDuring the night, General Schofield fell back towards Nashville.  This\r\nleft the field to the enemy--not lost by battle, but voluntarily\r\nabandoned--so that General Thomas's whole force might be brought\r\ntogether.  The enemy followed up and commenced the establishment of his\r\nline in front of Nashville on the 2d of December.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was ascertained that Hood was crossing the Tennessee\r\nRiver, and that Price was going out of Missouri, General Rosecrans was\r\nordered to send to General Thomas the troops of General A. J. Smith's\r\ncommand, and such other troops as he could spare.  The advance of this\r\nreinforcement reached Nashville on the 30th of November.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th December, General Thomas attacked Hood in\r\nposition, and, in a battle lasting two days, defeated and drove him from\r\nthe field in the utmost confusion, leaving in our hand most of his\r\nartillery and many thousand prisoners, including four general officers.\r\n\r\nBefore the battle of Nashville I grew very impatient over, as it\r\nappeared to me, the unnecessary delay.  This impatience was increased\r\nupon learning that the enemy had sent a force of cavalry across the\r\nCumberland into Kentucky.  I feared Hood would cross his whole army and\r\ngive us great trouble there. After urging upon General Thomas the\r\nnecessity of immediately assuming the offensive, I started West to\r\nsuperintend matters there in person.  Reaching Washington City, I\r\nreceived General Thomas's dispatch announcing his attack upon the enemy,\r\nand the result as far as the battle had progressed.  I was delighted.\r\nAll fears and apprehensions were dispelled.  I am not yet satisfied but\r\nthat General Thomas, immediately upon the appearance of Hood before\r\nNashville, and before he had time to fortify, should have moved out with\r\nhis whole force and given him battle, instead of waiting to remount his\r\ncavalry, which delayed him until the inclemency of the weather made it\r\nimpracticable to attack earlier than he did.  But his final defeat of\r\nHood was so complete, that it will be accepted as a vindication of that\r\ndistinguished officer's judgment.\r\n\r\nAfter Hood's defeat at Nashville he retreated, closely pursued by\r\ncavalry and infantry, to the Tennessee River, being forced to abandon\r\nmany pieces of artillery and most of his transportation.  On the 28th of\r\nDecember our advanced forces ascertained that he had made good his\r\nescape to the south side of the river.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the rains having set in heavily in Tennessee and North\r\nAlabama, making it difficult to move army transportation and artillery,\r\nGeneral Thomas stopped the pursuit by his main force at the Tennessee\r\nRiver.  A small force of cavalry, under Colonel W. J. Palmer, 15th\r\nPennsylvania Volunteers, continued to follow Hood for some distance,\r\ncapturing considerable transportation and all the enemy's\r\npontoon-bridge.  The details of these operations will be found\r\nclearly set forth in General Thomas's report.\r\n\r\nA cavalry expedition, under Brevet Major-General Grierson, started from\r\nMemphis on the 21st of December.  On the 25th he surprised and captured\r\nForrest's dismounted camp at Verona, Mississippi, on the Mobile and Ohio\r\nRailroad, destroyed the railroad, sixteen cars loaded with wagons and\r\npontoons for Hood's army, four thousand new English carbines, and large\r\namounts of public stores.  On the morning of the 28th he attacked and\r\ncaptured a force of the enemy at Egypt, and destroyed a train of\r\nfourteen cars; thence turning to the south-west, he struck the\r\nMississippi Central Railroad at Winona, destroyed the factories and\r\nlarge amounts of stores at Bankston, and the machine-shops and public\r\nproperty at Grenada, arriving at Vicksburg January 5th.\r\n\r\nDuring the operations in Middle Tennessee, the enemy, with a force under\r\nGeneral Breckinridge, entered East Tennessee.  On the 13th of November\r\nhe attacked General Gillem, near Morristown, capturing his artillery and\r\nseveral hundred prisoners.  Gillem, with what was left of his command,\r\nretreated to Knoxville.  Following up his success, Breckinridge moved to\r\nnear Knoxville, but withdrew on the 18th, followed by General Ammen.\r\nUnder the directions of General Thomas, General Stoneman concentrated\r\nthe commands of Generals Burbridge and Gillem near Bean's Station to\r\noperate against Breckinridge, and destroy or drive him into Virginia\r\n--destroy the salt-works at Saltville, and the railroad into Virginia\r\nas far as he could go without endangering his command.  On the 12th of\r\nDecember he commenced his movement, capturing and dispersing the enemy's\r\nforces wherever he met them.  On the 16th he struck the enemy, under\r\nVaughn, at Marion, completely routing and pursuing him to Wytheville,\r\ncapturing all his artillery, trains, and one hundred and ninety-eight\r\nprisoners; and destroyed Wytheville, with its stores and supplies, and\r\nthe extensive lead-works near there. Returning to Marion, he met a force\r\nunder Breckinridge, consisting, among other troops, of the garrison of\r\nSaltville, that had started in pursuit.  He at once made arrangements to\r\nattack it the next morning; but morning found Breckinridge gone.  He\r\nthen moved directly to Saltville, and destroyed the extensive salt-works\r\nat that place, a large amount of stores, and captured eight pieces of\r\nartillery.  Having thus successfully executed his instructions, he\r\nreturned General Burbridge to Lexington and General Gillem to Knoxville.\r\n\r\nWilmington, North Carolina, was the most important sea-coast port left\r\nto the enemy through which to get supplies from abroad, and send cotton\r\nand other products out by blockade-runners, besides being a place of\r\ngreat strategic value.  The navy had been making strenuous exertions to\r\nseal the harbor of Wilmington, but with only partial effect.  The nature\r\nof the outlet of Cape Fear River was such, that it required watching for\r\nso great a distance that, without possession of the land north of New\r\nInlet, or Fort Fisher, it was impossible for the navy to entirely close\r\nthe harbor against the entrance of blockade-runners.\r\n\r\nTo secure the possession of this land required the co-operation of a\r\nland force, which I agreed to furnish.  Immediately commenced the\r\nassemblage in Hampton Roads, under Admiral D. D. Porter, of the most\r\nformidable armada ever collected for concentration upon one given point.\r\nThis necessarily attracted the attention of the enemy, as well as that\r\nof the loyal North; and through the imprudence of the public press, and\r\nvery likely of officers of both branches of service, the exact object of\r\nthe expedition became a subject of common discussion in the newspapers\r\nboth North and South.  The enemy, thus warned, prepared to meet it.\r\nThis caused a postponement of the expedition until the later part of\r\nNovember, when, being again called upon by Hon. G. V. Fox, Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Navy, I agreed to furnish the men required at once, and\r\nwent myself, in company with Major-General Butler, to Hampton Roads,\r\nwhere we had a conference with Admiral Porter as to the force required\r\nand the time of starting.  A force of six thousand five hundred men was\r\nregarded as sufficient.  The time of starting was not definitely\r\narranged, but it was thought all would be ready by the 6th of December,\r\nif not before.  Learning, on the 30th of November, that Bragg had gone\r\nto Georgia, taking with him most of the forces about Wilmington, I\r\ndeemed it of the utmost importance that the expedition should reach its\r\ndestination before the return of Bragg, and directed General Butler to\r\nmake all arrangements for the departure of Major-General Weitzel, who\r\nhad been designated to command the land forces, so that the navy might\r\nnot be detained one moment.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of December, the following instructions were given:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, December 6, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:  The first object of the expedition under General Weitzel is\r\nto close to the enemy the port of Wilmington.  If successful in this,\r\nthe second will be to capture Wilmington itself.  There are reasonable\r\ngrounds to hope for success, if advantage can be taken of the absence of\r\nthe greater part of the enemy's forces now looking after Sherman in\r\nGeorgia.  The directions you have given for the numbers and equipment of\r\nthe expedition are all right, except in the unimportant matter of where\r\nthey embark and the amount of intrenching tools to be taken.  The object\r\nof the expedition will be gained by effecting a landing on the main land\r\nbetween Cape Fear River and the Atlantic, north of the north entrance to\r\nthe river.  Should such landing be effected while the enemy still holds\r\nFort Fisher and the batteries guarding the entrance to the river, then\r\nthe troops should intrench themselves, and, by co-operating with the\r\nnavy, effect the reduction and capture of those places.  These in our\r\nhands, the navy could enter the harbor, and the port of Wilmington would\r\nbe sealed.  Should Fort Fisher and the point of land on which it is\r\nbuilt fall into the hands of our troops immediately on landing, then it\r\nwill be worth the attempt to capture Wilmington by a forced march and\r\nsurprise.  If time is consumed in gaining the first object of the\r\nexpedition, the second will become a matter of after consideration.\r\n\r\n\"The details for execution are intrusted to you and the officer\r\nimmediately in command of the troops.\r\n\r\n\"Should the troops under General Weitzel fail to effect a landing at or\r\nnear Fort Fisher, they will be returned to the armies operating against\r\nRichmond without delay.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL B. F. BUTLER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler commanding the army from which the troops were taken for\r\nthis enterprise, and the territory within which they were to operate,\r\nmilitary courtesy required that all orders and instructions should go\r\nthrough him.  They were so sent, but General Weitzel has since\r\nofficially informed me that he never received the foregoing\r\ninstructions, nor was he aware of their existence, until he read General\r\nButler's published official report of the Fort Fisher failure, with my\r\nindorsement and papers accompanying it.  I had no idea of General\r\nButler's accompanying the expedition until the evening before it got off\r\nfrom Bermuda Hundred, and then did not dream but that General Weitzel\r\nhad received all the instructions, and would be in command.  I rather\r\nformed the idea that General Butler was actuated by a desire to witness\r\nthe effect of the explosion of the powder-boat.  The expedition was\r\ndetained several days at Hampton Roads, awaiting the loading of the\r\npowder-boat.\r\n\r\nThe importance of getting the Wilmington expedition off without any\r\ndelay, with or without the powder-boat, had been urged upon General\r\nButler, and he advised to so notify Admiral Porter.\r\n\r\nThe expedition finally got off on the 13th of December, and arrived at\r\nthe place of rendezvous, off New Inlet, near Fort Fisher, on the evening\r\nof the 15th.  Admiral Porter arrived on the evening of the 18th, having\r\nput in at Beaufort to get ammunition for the monitors.  The sea becoming\r\nrough, making it difficult to land troops, and the supply of water and\r\ncoal being about exhausted, the transport fleet put back to Beaufort to\r\nreplenish; this, with the state of the weather, delayed the return to\r\nthe place of rendezvous until the 24th.  The powder-boat was exploded on\r\nthe morning of the 24th, before the return of General Butler from\r\nBeaufort; but it would seem, from the notice taken of it in the Southern\r\nnewspapers, that the enemy were never enlightened as to the object of\r\nthe explosion until they were informed by the Northern press.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th a landing was effected without opposition, and a\r\nreconnoissance, under Brevet Brigadier-General Curtis, pushed up towards\r\nthe fort.  But before receiving a full report of the result of this\r\nreconnoissance, General Butler, in direct violation of the instructions\r\ngiven, ordered the re-embarkation of the troops and the return of the\r\nexpedition.  The re-embarkation was accomplished by the morning of the\r\n27th.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the expedition officers and men among them Brevet\r\nMajor-General (then Brevet Brigadier-General) N. M. Curtis,\r\nFirst-Lieutenant G. W. Ross, 117th Regiment New York Volunteers,\r\nFirst-Lieutenant William H. Walling, and Second-Lieutenant George\r\nSimpson, 142d New York Volunteers voluntarily reported to me that when\r\nrecalled they were nearly into the fort, and, in their opinion, it could\r\nhave been taken without much loss.\r\n\r\nSoon after the return of the expedition, I received a dispatch from the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, and a letter from Admiral Porter, informing me\r\nthat the fleet was still off Fort Fisher, and expressing the conviction\r\nthat, under a proper leader, the place could be taken.  The natural\r\nsupposition with me was, that when the troops abandoned the expedition,\r\nthe navy would do so also.  Finding it had not, however, I answered on\r\nthe 30th of December, advising Admiral Porter to hold on, and that I\r\nwould send a force and make another attempt to take the place.  This\r\ntime I selected Brevet Major-General (now Major-General) A. H. Terry to\r\ncommand the expedition.  The troops composing it consisted of the same\r\nthat composed the former, with the addition of a small brigade,\r\nnumbering about one thousand five hundred, and a small siege train.  The\r\nlatter it was never found necessary to land.  I communicated direct to\r\nthe commander of the expedition the following instructions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, January 3, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:  The expedition intrusted to your command has been fitted out\r\nto renew the attempt to capture Fort Fisher, N. C., and Wilmington\r\nultimately, if the fort falls.  You will then proceed with as little\r\ndelay as possible to the naval fleet lying off Cape Fear River, and\r\nreport the arrival of yourself and command to Admiral D. D. Porter,\r\ncommanding North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.\r\n\r\n\"It is exceedingly desirable that the most complete understanding should\r\nexist between yourself and the naval commander.  I suggest, therefore,\r\nthat you consult with Admiral Porter freely, and get from him the part\r\nto be performed by each branch of the public service, so that there may\r\nbe unity of action.  It would be well to have the whole programme laid\r\ndown in writing.  I have served with Admiral Porter, and know that you\r\ncan rely on his judgment and his nerve to undertake what he proposes.  I\r\nwould, therefore, defer to him as much as is consistent with your own\r\nresponsibilities.  The first object to be attained is to get a firm\r\nposition on the spit of land on which Fort Fisher is built, from which\r\nyou can operate against that fort.  You want to look to the\r\npracticability of receiving your supplies, and to defending yourself\r\nagainst superior forces sent against you by any of the avenues left open\r\nto the enemy. If such a position can be obtained, the siege of Fort\r\nFisher will not be abandoned until its reduction is accomplished, or\r\nanother plan of campaign is ordered from these headquarters.\r\n\r\n\"My own views are, that if you effect a landing, the navy ought to run a\r\nportion of their fleet into Cape Fear River, while the balance of it\r\noperates on the outside.  Land forces cannot invest Fort Fisher, or cut\r\nit off from supplies or reinforcements, while the river is in possession\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"A siege-train will be loaded on vessels and sent to Fort Monroe, in\r\nreadiness to be sent to you if required.  All other supplies can be\r\ndrawn from Beaufort as you need them.\r\n\r\n\"Keep the fleet of vessels with you until your position is assured.\r\nWhen you find they can be spared, order them back, or such of them as\r\nyou can spare, to Fort Monroe, to report for orders.\r\n\r\n\"In case of failure to effect a landing, bring your command back to\r\nBeaufort, and report to these headquarters for further instructions.\r\nYou will not debark at Beaufort until so directed.\r\n\r\n\"General Sheridan has been ordered to send a division of troops to\r\nBaltimore and place them on sea-going vessels.  These troops will be\r\nbrought to Fort Monroe and kept there on the vessels until you are heard\r\nfrom.  Should you require them, they will be sent to you.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"BREVET MAJOR-GENERAL A. H. TERRY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel C. B. Comstock, aide-de-camp (now brevet\r\nbrigadier-general), who accompanied the former expedition,\r\nwas assigned, in orders, as chief-engineer to this.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that these instructions did not differ materially from\r\nthose given for the first expedition, and that in neither instance was\r\nthere an order to assault Fort Fisher. This was a matter left entirely\r\nto the discretion of the commanding officer.\r\n\r\nThe expedition sailed from Fort Monroe on the morning of the 6th,\r\narriving at the rendezvous, off Beaufort, on the 8th, where, owing to\r\nthe difficulties of the weather, it lay until the morning of the 12th,\r\nwhen it got under way and reached its destination that evening.  Under\r\ncover of the fleet, the disembarkation of the troops commenced on the\r\nmorning of the 13th, and by three o'clock P.M. was completed without\r\nloss.  On the 14th a reconnoissance was pushed to within five hundred\r\nyards of Fort Fisher, and a small advance work taken possession of and\r\nturned into a defensive line against any attempt that might be made from\r\nthe fort.  This reconnoissance disclosed the fact that the front of the\r\nwork had been seriously injured by the navy fire.  In the afternoon of\r\nthe 15th the fort was assaulted, and after most desperate fighting was\r\ncaptured, with its entire garrison and armament.  Thus was secured, by\r\nthe combined efforts of the navy and army, one of the most important\r\nsuccesses of the war.  Our loss was:  killed, one hundred and ten;\r\nwounded, five hundred and thirty-six.  On the 16th and the 17th the\r\nenemy abandoned and blew up Fort Caswell and the works on Smith's\r\nIsland, which were immediately occupied by us.  This gave us entire\r\ncontrol of the mouth of the Cape Fear River.\r\n\r\nAt my request, Mayor-General B. F. Butler was relieved, and\r\nMajor-General E. O. C. Ord assigned to the Department of Virginia and\r\nNorth Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe defence of the line of the Tennessee no longer requiring the force\r\nwhich had beaten and nearly destroyed the only army now threatening it,\r\nI determined to find other fields of operation for General Thomas's\r\nsurplus troops--fields from which they would co-operate with other\r\nmovements.  General Thomas was therefore directed to collect all troops,\r\nnot essential to hold his communications at Eastport, in readiness for\r\norders.  On the 7th of January, General Thomas was directed, if he was\r\nassured of the departure of Hood south from Corinth, to send General\r\nSchofield with his corps east with as little delay as possible.  This\r\ndirection was promptly complied with, and the advance of the corps\r\nreached Washington on the 23d of the same month, whence it was sent to\r\nFort Fisher and New Bern.  On the 26th he was directed to send General\r\nA. J. Smith's command and a division of cavalry to report to General\r\nCanby.  By the 7th of February the whole force was en route for its\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nThe State of North Carolina was constituted into a military department,\r\nand General Schofield assigned to command, and placed under the orders\r\nof Major-General Sherman.  The following instructions were given him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, VA., January 31, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:-- *    *    *    Your movements are intended as co-operative\r\nwith Sherman's through the States of South and North Carolina.  The\r\nfirst point to be attained is to secure Wilmington.  Goldsboro' will\r\nthen be your objective point, moving either from Wilmington or New Bern,\r\nor both, as you deem best.  Should you not be able to reach Goldsboro',\r\nyou will advance on the line or lines of railway connecting that place\r\nwith the sea-coast--as near to it as you can, building the road behind\r\nyou.  The enterprise under you has two objects:  the first is to give\r\nGeneral Sherman material aid, if needed, in his march north; the second,\r\nto open a base of supplies for him on his line of march.  As soon,\r\ntherefore, as you can determine which of the two points, Wilmington or\r\nNew Bern, you can best use for throwing supplies from, to the interior,\r\nyou will commence the accumulation of twenty days' rations and forage\r\nfor sixty thousand men and twenty thousand animals.  You will get of\r\nthese as many as you can house and protect to such point in the interior\r\nas you may be able to occupy.  I believe General Palmer has received\r\nsome instructions direct from General Sherman on the subject of securing\r\nsupplies for his army.  You will learn what steps he has taken, and be\r\ngoverned in your requisitions accordingly.  A supply of ordnance stores\r\nwill also be necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Make all requisitions upon the chiefs of their respective departments\r\nin the field with me at City Point.  Communicate with me by every\r\nopportunity, and should you deem it necessary at any time, send a\r\nspecial boat to Fortress Monroe, from which point you can communicate by\r\ntelegraph.\r\n\r\n\"The supplies referred to in these instructions are exclusive of those\r\nrequired for your own command.\r\n\r\n\"The movements of the enemy may justify, or even make it your imperative\r\nduty, to cut loose from your base, and strike for the interior to aid\r\nSherman.  In such case you will act on your own judgment without waiting\r\nfor instructions.  You will report, however, what you purpose doing.\r\nThe details for carrying out these instructions are necessarily left to\r\nyou.  I would urge, however, if I did not know that you are already\r\nfully alive to the importance of it, prompt action.  Sherman may be\r\nlooked for in the neighborhood of Goldsboro' any time from the 22d to\r\nthe 28th of February; this limits your time very materially.\r\n\r\n\"If rolling-stock is not secured in the capture of Wilmington, it can be\r\nsupplied from Washington.  A large force of railroad men have already\r\nbeen sent to Beaufort, and other mechanics will go to Fort Fisher in a\r\nday or two.  On this point I have informed you by telegraph.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to giving these instructions I had visited Fort Fisher,\r\naccompanied by General Schofield, for the purpose of seeing for myself\r\nthe condition of things, and personally conferring with General Terry\r\nand Admiral Porter as to what was best to be done.\r\n\r\nAnticipating the arrival of General Sherman at Savannah his army\r\nentirely foot-loose, Hood being then before Nashville, Tennessee, the\r\nSouthern railroads destroyed, so that it would take several months to\r\nre-establish a through line from west to east, and regarding the capture\r\nof Lee's army as the most important operation towards closing the\r\nrebellion--I sent orders to General Sherman on the 6th of December, that\r\nafter establishing a base on the sea-coast, with necessary garrison, to\r\ninclude all his artillery and cavalry, to come by water to City Point\r\nwith the balance of his command.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of December, having received information of the defeat and\r\nutter rout of Hood's army by General Thomas, and that, owing to the\r\ngreat difficulty of procuring ocean transportation, it would take over\r\ntwo months to transport Sherman's army, and doubting whether he might\r\nnot contribute as much towards the desired result by operating from\r\nwhere he was, I wrote to him to that effect, and asked him for his views\r\nas to what would be best to do.  A few days after this I received a\r\ncommunication from General Sherman, of date 16th December, acknowledging\r\nthe receipt of my order of the 6th, and informing me of his preparations\r\nto carry it into effect as soon as he could get transportation.  Also\r\nthat he had expected, upon reducing Savannah, instantly to march to\r\nColumbia, South Carolina, thence to Raleigh, and thence to report to me;\r\nbut that this would consume about six weeks' time after the fall of\r\nSavannah, whereas by sea he could probably reach me by the middle of\r\nJanuary.  The confidence he manifested in this letter of being able to\r\nmarch up and join me pleased me, and, without waiting for a reply to my\r\nletter of the 18th, I directed him, on the 28th of December, to make\r\npreparations to start as he proposed, without delay, to break up the\r\nrailroads in North and South Carolina, and join the armies operating\r\nagainst Richmond as soon as he could.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of January I informed General Sherman that I had ordered the\r\n23d corps,  Major-General Schofield commanding, east; that it numbered\r\nabout twenty-one thousand men; that we had at Fort Fisher, about eight\r\nthousand men; at New Bern, about four thousand; that if Wilmington was\r\ncaptured, General Schofield would go there; if not, he would be sent to\r\nNew Bern; that, in either event, all the surplus force at both points\r\nwould move to the interior towards Goldsboro', in co-operation with his\r\nmovement; that from either point railroad communication could be run\r\nout; and that all these troops would be subject to his orders as he came\r\ninto communication with them.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to his instructions, General Schofield proceeded to reduce\r\nWilmington, North Carolina, in co-operation with the navy under Admiral\r\nPorter, moving his forces up both sides of the Cape Fear River.  Fort\r\nAnderson, the enemy's main defence on the west bank of the river, was\r\noccupied on the morning of the 19th, the enemy having evacuated it after\r\nour appearance before it.\r\n\r\nAfter fighting on 20th and 21st, our troops entered Wilmington on the\r\nmorning of the 22d, the enemy having retreated towards Goldsboro' during\r\nthe night.  Preparations were at once made for a movement on Goldsboro'\r\nin two columns--one from Wilmington, and the other from New Bern--and to\r\nrepair the railroad leading there from each place, as well as to supply\r\nGeneral Sherman by Cape Fear River, towards Fayetteville, if it became\r\nnecessary.  The column from New Bern was attacked on the 8th of March,\r\nat Wise's Forks, and driven back with the loss of several hundred\r\nprisoners.  On the 11th the enemy renewed his attack upon our intrenched\r\nposition, but was repulsed with severe loss, and fell back during the\r\nnight.  On the 14th the Neuse River was crossed and Kinston occupied,\r\nand on the 21st Goldsboro' was entered. The column from Wilmington\r\nreached Cox's Bridge, on the Neuse River, ten miles above Goldsboro', on\r\nthe 22d.\r\n\r\nBy the 1st of February, General Sherman's whole army was in motion from\r\nSavannah.  He captured Columbia, South Carolina, on the 17th; thence\r\nmoved on Goldsboro', North Carolina, via Fayetteville, reaching the\r\nlatter place on the 12th of March, opening up communication with General\r\nSchofield by way of Cape Fear River.  On the 15th he resumed his march\r\non Goldsboro'.  He met a force of the enemy at Averysboro', and after a\r\nsevere fight defeated and compelled it to retreat.  Our loss in this\r\nengagement was about six hundred.  The enemy's loss was much greater.\r\nOn the 18th the combined forces of the enemy, under Joe Johnston,\r\nattacked his advance at Bentonville, capturing three guns and driving it\r\nback upon the main body.  General Slocum, who was in the advance\r\nascertaining that the whole of Johnston's army was in the front,\r\narranged his troops on the defensive, intrenched himself and awaited\r\nreinforcements, which were pushed forward.  On the night of the 21st the\r\nenemy retreated to Smithfield, leaving his dead and wounded in our\r\nhands.  From there Sherman continued to Goldsboro', which place had been\r\noccupied by General Schofield on the 21st (crossing the Neuse River ten\r\nmiles above there, at Cox's Bridge, where General Terry had got\r\npossession and thrown a pontoon-bridge on the 22d), thus forming a\r\njunction with the columns from New Bern and Wilmington.\r\n\r\nAmong the important fruits of this campaign was the fall of Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina. It was evacuated by the enemy on the night of the 17th\r\nof February, and occupied by our forces on the 18th.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 31st of January, General Thomas was directed to\r\nsend a cavalry expedition, under General Stoneman, from East Tennessee,\r\nto penetrate South Carolina well down towards Columbia, to destroy the\r\nrailroads and military resources of the country, and return, if he was\r\nable, to East Tennessee by way of Salisbury, North Carolina, releasing\r\nour prisoners there, if possible.  Of the feasibility of this latter,\r\nhowever, General Stoneman was to judge.  Sherman's movements, I had no\r\ndoubt, would attract the attention of all the force the enemy could\r\ncollect, and facilitate the execution of this.  General Stoneman was so\r\nlate in making his start on this expedition (and Sherman having passed\r\nout of the State of South Carolina), on the 27th of February I directed\r\nGeneral Thomas to change his course, and order him to repeat his raid of\r\nlast fall, destroying the railroad towards Lynchburg as far as he could.\r\nThis would keep him between our garrisons in East Tennessee and the\r\nenemy.  I regarded it not impossible that in the event of the enemy\r\nbeing driven from Richmond, he might fall back to Lynchburg and attempt\r\na raid north through East Tennessee.  On the 14th of February the\r\nfollowing communication was sent to General Thomas:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, VA., February 14, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"General Canby is preparing a movement from Mobile Bay against Mobile\r\nand the interior of Alabama. His force will consist of about twenty\r\nthousand men, besides A. J. Smith's command.  The cavalry you have sent\r\nto Canby will be debarked at Vicksburg. It, with the available cavalry\r\nalready in that section, will move from there eastward, in co-operation.\r\nHood's army has been terribly reduced by the severe punishment you gave\r\nit in Tennessee, by desertion consequent upon their defeat, and now by\r\nthe withdrawal of many of them to oppose Sherman.  (I take it a large\r\nportion of the infantry has been so withdrawn.  It is so asserted in the\r\nRichmond papers, and a member of the rebel Congress said a few days\r\nsince in a speech, that one-half of it had been brought to South\r\nCarolina to oppose Sherman.)  This being true, or even if it is not\r\ntrue, Canby's movement will attract all the attention of the enemy, and\r\nleave the advance from your standpoint easy.  I think it advisable,\r\ntherefore, that you prepare as much of a cavalry force as you can spare,\r\nand hold it in readiness to go south.  The object would be threefold:\r\nfirst, to attract as much of the enemy's force as possible, to insure\r\nsuccess to Canby; second, to destroy the enemy's line of communications\r\nand military resources; third, to destroy or capture their forces\r\nbrought into the field. Tuscaloosa and Selma would probably be the\r\npoints to direct the expedition against.  This, however, would not be so\r\nimportant as the mere fact of penetrating deep into Alabama.  Discretion\r\nshould be left to the officer commanding the expedition to go where,\r\naccording to the information he may receive, he will best secure the\r\nobjects named above.\r\n\r\n\"Now that your force has been so much depleted, I do not know what\r\nnumber of men you can put into the field.  If not more than five\r\nthousand men, however, all cavalry, I think it will be sufficient.  It\r\nis not desirable that you should start this expedition until the one\r\nleaving Vicksburg has been three or four days out, or even a week.  I do\r\nnot know when it will start, but will inform you by telegraph as soon as\r\nI learn.  If you should hear through other sources before hearing from\r\nme, you can act on the information received.\r\n\r\n\"To insure success your cavalry should go with as little wagon-train as\r\npossible, relying upon the country for supplies.  I would also reduce\r\nthe number of guns to a battery, or the number of batteries, and put the\r\nextra teams to the guns taken.  No guns or caissons should be taken with\r\nless than eight horses.\r\n\r\n\"Please inform me by telegraph, on receipt of this, what force you think\r\nyou will be able to send under these directions.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL G. H. THOMAS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 15th, he was directed to start the expedition as soon after the\r\n20th as he could get it off.\r\n\r\nI deemed it of the utmost importance, before a general movement of the\r\narmies operating against Richmond, that all communications with the\r\ncity, north of James River, should be cut off.  The enemy having\r\nwithdrawn the bulk of his force from the Shenandoah Valley and sent it\r\nsouth, or replaced troops sent from Richmond, and desiring to reinforce\r\nSherman, if practicable, whose cavalry was greatly inferior in numbers\r\nto that of the enemy, I determined to make a move from the Shenandoah,\r\nwhich, if successful, would accomplish the first at least, and possibly\r\nthe latter of the objects.  I therefore telegraphed General Sheridan as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, VA., February 20, 1865--1 P.M.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:--As soon as it is possible to travel, I think you will have no\r\ndifficulty about reaching Lynchburg with a cavalry force alone.  From\r\nthere you could destroy the railroad and canal in every direction, so as\r\nto be of no further use to the rebellion.  Sufficient cavalry should be\r\nleft behind to look after Mosby's gang.  From Lynchburg, if information\r\nyou might get there would justify it, you will strike south, heading the\r\nstreams in Virgina to the westward of Danville, and push on and join\r\nGeneral Sherman.  This additional raid, with one now about starting from\r\nEast Tennessee under Stoneman, numbering four or give thousand cavalry,\r\none from Vicksburg, numbering seven or eight thousand cavalry, one from\r\nEastport, Mississippi, then thousand cavalry, Canby from Mobile Bay,\r\nwith about thirty-eight thousand mixed troops, these three latter\r\npushing for Tuscaloosa, Selma, and Montgomery, and Sherman with a large\r\narmy eating out the vitals of South Carolina, is all that will be wanted\r\nto leave nothing for the rebellion to stand upon.  I would advise you to\r\novercome great obstacles to accomplish this.  Charleston was evacuated\r\non Tuesday 1st.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 25th I received a dispatch from General Sheridan, inquiring where\r\nSherman was aiming for, and if I could give him definite information as\r\nto the points he might be expected to move on, this side of Charlotte,\r\nNorth Carolina.  In answer, the following telegram was sent him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, VA., February 25, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:--Sherman's movements will depend on the amount of opposition\r\nhe meets with from the enemy.  If strongly opposed, he may possibly have\r\nto fall back to Georgetown, S. C., and fit out for a new start.  I\r\nthink, however, all danger for the necessity of going to that point has\r\npassed.  I believe he has passed Charlotte.  He may take Fayetteville on\r\nhis way to Goldsboro'.  If you reach Lynchburg, you will have to be\r\nguided in your after movements by the information you obtain.  Before\r\nyou could possibly reach Sherman, I think you would find him moving from\r\nGoldsboro' towards Raleigh, or engaging the enemy strongly posted at one\r\nor the other of these places, with railroad communications opened from\r\nhis army to Wilmington or New Bern.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Sheridan moved from Winchester on the 27th of February, with two\r\ndivisions of cavalry, numbering about five thousand each.  On the 1st of\r\nMarch he secured the bridge, which the enemy attempted to destroy,\r\nacross the middle fork of the Shenandoah, at Mount Crawford, and entered\r\nStaunton on the 2d, the enemy having retreated to Waynesboro'.  Thence\r\nhe pushed on to Waynesboro', where he found the enemy in force in an\r\nintrenched position, under General Early.  Without stopping to make a\r\nreconnoissance, an immediate attack was made, the position was carried,\r\nand sixteen hundred prisoners, eleven pieces of artillery, with horses\r\nand caissons complete, two hundred wagons and teams loaded with\r\nsubsistence, and seventeen battle-flags, were captured.  The prisoners,\r\nunder an escort of fifteen hundred men, were sent back to Winchester.\r\nThence he marched on Charlottesville, destroying effectually the\r\nrailroad and bridges as he went, which place he reached on the 3d.  Here\r\nhe remained two days, destroying the railroad towards Richmond and\r\nLynchburg, including the large iron bridges over the north and south\r\nforks of the Rivanna River and awaited the arrival of his trains.  This\r\nnecessary delay caused him to abandon the idea of capturing Lynchburg.\r\nOn the morning of the 6th, dividing his force into two columns, he sent\r\none to Scottsville, whence it marched up the James River Canal to New\r\nMarket, destroying every lock, and in many places the bank of the canal.\r\nFrom here a force was pushed out from this column to Duiguidsville, to\r\nobtain possession of the bridge across the James River at that place,\r\nbut failed.  The enemy burned it on our approach.  The enemy also burned\r\nthe bridge across the river at Hardwicksville.  The other column moved\r\ndown the railroad towards Lynchburg, destroying it as far as Amherst\r\nCourt House, sixteen miles from Lynchburg; thence across the country,\r\nuniting with the column at New Market.  The river being very high, his\r\npontoons would not reach across it; and the enemy having destroyed the\r\nbridges by which he had hoped to cross the river and get on the South\r\nSide Railroad about Farmville, and destroy it to Appomattox Court House,\r\nthe only thing left for him was to return to Winchester or strike a base\r\nat the White House. Fortunately, he chose the latter.  From New Market\r\nhe took up his line of march, following the canal towards Richmond,\r\ndestroying every lock upon it and cutting the banks wherever\r\npracticable, to a point eight miles east of Goochland, concentrating the\r\nwhole force at Columbia on the 10th.  Here he rested one day, and sent\r\nthrough by scouts information of his whereabouts and purposes, and a\r\nrequest for supplies to meet him at White House, which reached me on the\r\nnight of the 12th.  An infantry force was immediately sent to get\r\npossession of White House, and supplies were forwarded.  Moving from\r\nColumbia in a direction to threaten Richmond, to near Ashland Station,\r\nhe crossed the Annas, and after having destroyed all the bridges and\r\nmany miles of the railroad, proceeded down the north bank of the\r\nPamunkey to White House, which place he reached on the 19th.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this the following communication was sent to General Thomas:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 7, 1865--9.30 A.M.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:--I think it will be advisable now for you to repair the\r\nrailroad in East Tennessee, and throw a good force up to Bull's Gap and\r\nfortify there.  Supplies at Knoxville could always be got forward as\r\nrequired.  With Bull's Gap fortified, you can occupy as outposts about\r\nall of East Tennessee, and be prepared, if it should be required of you\r\nin the spring, to make a campaign towards Lynchburg, or into North\r\nCarolina.  I do not think Stoneman should break the road until he gets\r\ninto Virginia, unless it should be to cut off rolling-stock that may be\r\ncaught west of that.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL G. H. THOMAS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that in March, 1865, General Canby was moving an\r\nadequate force against Mobile and the army defending it under General\r\nDick Taylor; Thomas was pushing out two large and well-appointed cavalry\r\nexpeditions--one from Middle Tennessee under Brevet Major-General Wilson\r\nagainst the enemy's vital points in Alabama, the other from East\r\nTennessee, under Major-General Stoneman, towards Lynchburg--and\r\nassembling the remainder of his available forces, preparatory to\r\ncommence offensive operations from East Tennessee; General Sheridan's\r\ncavalry was at White House; the armies of the Potomac and James were\r\nconfronting the enemy, under Lee, in his defences of Richmond and\r\nPetersburg; General Sherman with his armies, reinforced by that of\r\nGeneral Schofield, was at Goldsboro'; General Pope was making\r\npreparations for a spring campaign against the enemy under Kirby Smith\r\nand Price, west of the Mississippi; and General Hancock was\r\nconcentrating a force in the vicinity of Winchester, Virginia, to guard\r\nagainst invasion or to operate offensively, as might prove necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter the long march by General Sheridan's cavalry over winter roads, it\r\nwas necessary to rest and refit at White House.  At this time the\r\ngreatest source of uneasiness to me was the fear that the enemy would\r\nleave his strong lines about Petersburg and Richmond for the purpose of\r\nuniting with Johnston, and before he was driven from them by battle, or\r\nI was prepared to make an effectual pursuit.  On the 24th of March,\r\nGeneral Sheridan moved from White House, crossed the James River at\r\nJones's Landing, and formed a junction with the Army of the Potomac in\r\nfront of Petersburg on the 27th.  During this move, General Ord sent\r\nforces to cover the crossings of the Chickahominy.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of March the following instructions for a general movement\r\nof the armies operating against Richmond were issued:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 24, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:  On the 29th instant the armies operating against Richmond\r\nwill be moved by our left, for the double purpose of turning the enemy\r\nout of his present position around Petersburg, and to insure the success\r\nof the cavalry under General Sheridan, which will start at the same\r\ntime, in its efforts to reach and destroy the South Side and Danville\r\nrailroads.  Two corps of the Army of the Potomac will be moved at first\r\nin two columns, taking the two roads crossing Hatcher's Run, nearest\r\nwhere the present line held by us strikes that stream, both moving\r\ntowards Dinwiddie Court House.\r\n\r\n\"The cavalry under General Sheridan, joined by the division now under\r\nGeneral Davies, will move at the same time by the Weldon Road and the\r\nJerusalem Plank Road, turning west from the latter before crossing the\r\nNottoway, and west with the whole column before reaching Stony Creek.\r\nGeneral Sheridan will then move independently, under other instructions\r\nwhich will be given him.  All dismounted cavalry belonging to the Army\r\nof the Potomac, and the dismounted cavalry from the Middle Military\r\nDivision not required for guarding property belonging to their arm of\r\nservice, will report to Brigadier-General Benham, to be added to the\r\ndefences of City Point.  Major-General Parke will be left in command of\r\nall the army left for holding the lines about Petersburg and City Point,\r\nsubject of course to orders from the commander of the Army of the\r\nPotomac.  The 9th army corps will be left intact, to hold the present\r\nline of works so long as the whole line now occupied by us is held.  If,\r\nhowever, the troops to the left of the 9th corps are withdrawn, then the\r\nleft of the corps may be thrown back so as to occupy the position held\r\nby the army prior to the capture of the Weldon Road.  All troops to the\r\nleft of the 9th corps will be held in readiness to move at the shortest\r\nnotice by such route as may be designated when the order is given.\r\n\r\n\"General Ord will detach three divisions, two white and one colored, or\r\nso much of them as he can, and hold his present lines, and march for the\r\npresent left of the Army of the Potomac.  In the absence of further\r\norders, or until further orders are given, the white divisions will\r\nfollow the left column of the Army of the Potomac, and the colored\r\ndivision the right column.  During the movement Major-General Weitzel\r\nwill be left in command of all the forces remaining behind from the Army\r\nof the James.\r\n\r\n\"The movement of troops from the Army of the James will commence on the\r\nnight of the 27th instant.  General Ord will leave behind the minimum\r\nnumber of cavalry necessary for picket duty, in the absence of the main\r\narmy.  A cavalry expedition, from General Ord's command, will also be\r\nstarted from Suffolk, to leave there on Saturday, the 1st of April,\r\nunder Colonel Sumner, for the purpose of cutting the railroad about\r\nHicksford.  This, if accomplished, will have to be a surprise, and\r\ntherefore from three to five hundred men will be sufficient.  They\r\nshould, however, be supported by all the infantry that can be spared\r\nfrom Norfolk and Portsmouth, as far out as to where the cavalry crosses\r\nthe Blackwater.  The crossing should probably be at Uniten.  Should\r\nColonel Sumner succeed in reaching the Weldon Road, he will be\r\ninstructed to do all the damage possible to the triangle of roads\r\nbetween Hicksford, Weldon, and Gaston.  The railroad bridge at Weldon\r\nbeing fitted up for the passage of carriages, it might be practicable to\r\ndestroy any accumulation of supplies the enemy may have collected south\r\nof the Roanoke. All the troops will move with four days' rations in\r\nhaversacks and eight days' in wagons.  To avoid as much hauling as\r\npossible, and to give the Army of the James the same number of days'\r\nsupplies with the Army of the Potomac, General Ord will direct his\r\ncommissary and quartermaster to have sufficient supplies delivered at\r\nthe terminus of the road to fill up in passing.  Sixty rounds of\r\nammunition per man will be taken in wagons, and as much grain as the\r\ntransportation on hand will carry, after taking the specified amount of\r\nother supplies.  The densely wooded country in which the army has to\r\noperate making the use of much artillery impracticable, the amount taken\r\nwith the army will be reduced to six or eight guns to each division, at\r\nthe option of the army commanders.\r\n\r\n\"All necessary preparations for carrying these directions into operation\r\nmay be commenced at once.  The reserves of the 9th corps should be\r\nmassed as much as possible.  While I would not now order an\r\nunconditional attack on the enemy's line by them, they should be ready\r\nand should make the attack if the enemy weakens his line in their front,\r\nwithout waiting for orders.  In case they carry the line, then the whole\r\nof the 9th corps could follow up so as to join or co-operate with the\r\nbalance of the army.  To prepare for this, the 9th corps will have\r\nrations issued to them, same as the balance of the army.  General\r\nWeitzel will keep vigilant watch upon his front, and if found at all\r\npracticable to break through at any point, he will do so.  A success\r\nnorth of the James should be followed up with great promptness.  An\r\nattack will not be feasible unless it is found that the enemy has\r\ndetached largely.  In that case it may be regarded as evident that the\r\nenemy are relying upon their local reserves principally for the defence\r\nof Richmond.  Preparations may be made for abandoning all the line north\r\nof the James, except inclosed works only to be abandoned, however, after\r\na break is made in the lines of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"By these instructions a large part of the armies operating against\r\nRichmond is left behind.  The enemy, knowing this, may, as an only\r\nchance, strip their lines to the merest skeleton, in the hope of\r\nadvantage not being taken of it, while they hurl everything against the\r\nmoving column, and return.  It cannot be impressed too strongly upon\r\ncommanders of troops left in the trenches not to allow this to occur\r\nwithout taking advantage of it.  The very fact of the enemy coming out\r\nto attack, if he does so, might be regarded as almost conclusive\r\nevidence of such a weakening of his lines.  I would have it particularly\r\nenjoined upon corps commanders that, in case of an attack from the\r\nenemy, those not attacked are not to wait for orders from the commanding\r\nofficer of the army to which they belong, but that they will move\r\npromptly, and notify the commander of their action.  I would also enjoin\r\nthe same action on the part of division commanders when other parts of\r\ntheir corps are engaged.  In like manner, I would urge the importance of\r\nfollowing up a repulse of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERALS MEADE, ORD, AND SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 25th the enemy assaulted our lines in front\r\nof the 9th corps (which held from the Appomattox River towards our\r\nleft), and carried Fort Stedman, and a part of the line to the right and\r\nleft of it, established themselves and turned the guns of the fort\r\nagainst us, but our troops on either flank held their ground until the\r\nreserves were brought up, when the enemy was driven back with a heavy\r\nloss in killed and wounded, and one thousand nine hundred prisoners.\r\nOur loss was sixty-eight killed, three hundred and thirty-seven wounded,\r\nand five hundred and six missing.  General Meade at once ordered the\r\nother corps to advance and feel the enemy in their respective fronts.\r\nPushing forward, they captured and held the enemy's strongly intrenched\r\npicket-line in front of the 2d and 6th corps, and eight hundred and\r\nthirty-four prisoners.  The enemy made desperate attempts to retake this\r\nline, but without success.  Our loss in front of these was fifty-two\r\nkilled, eight hundred and sixty-four wounded, and two hundred and seven\r\nmissing.  The enemy's loss in killed and wounded was far greater.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman having got his troops all quietly in camp about\r\nGoldsboro', and his preparations for furnishing supplies to them\r\nperfected, visited me at City Point on the 27th of March, and stated\r\nthat he would be ready to move, as he had previously written me, by the\r\n10th of April, fully equipped and rationed for twenty days, if it should\r\nbecome necessary to bring his command to bear against Lee's army, in\r\nco-operation with our forces in front of Richmond and Petersburg.\r\nGeneral Sherman proposed in this movement to threaten Raleigh, and then,\r\nby turning suddenly to the right, reach the Roanoke at Gaston or\r\nthereabouts, whence he could move on to the Richmond and Danville\r\nRailroad, striking it in the vicinity of Burkesville, or join the armies\r\noperating against Richmond, as might be deemed best.  This plan he was\r\ndirected to carry into execution, if he received no further directions\r\nin the meantime.  I explained to him the movement I had ordered to\r\ncommence on the 29th of March.  That if it should not prove as entirely\r\nsuccessful as I hoped, I would cut the cavalry loose to destroy the\r\nDanville and South Side railroads, and thus deprive the enemy of further\r\nsupplies, and also to prevent the rapid concentration of Lee's and\r\nJohnston's armies.\r\n\r\nI had spent days of anxiety lest each morning should bring the report\r\nthat the enemy had retreated the night before.  I was firmly convinced\r\nthat Sherman's crossing the Roanoke would be the signal for Lee to\r\nleave.  With Johnston and him combined, a long, tedious, and expensive\r\ncampaign, consuming most of the summer, might become necessary.  By\r\nmoving out I would put the army in better condition for pursuit, and\r\nwould at least, by the destruction of the Danville Road, retard the\r\nconcentration of the two armies of Lee and Johnston, and cause the enemy\r\nto abandon much material that he might otherwise save.  I therefore\r\ndetermined not to delay the movement ordered.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 27th, Major-General Ord, with two divisions of the\r\n24th corps, Major-General Gibbon commanding, and one division of the\r\n25th corps, Brigadier-General Birney commanding, and MacKenzie's\r\ncavalry, took up his line of march in pursuance of the foregoing\r\ninstructions, and reached the position assigned him near Hatcher's Run\r\non the morning of the 29th.  On the 28th the following instructions were\r\ngiven to General Sheridan:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, VA., March 28, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:--The 5th army corps will move by the Vaughn Road at three A.M.\r\nto-morrow morning.  The 2d moves at about nine A.M., having but about\r\nthree miles to march to reach the point designated for it to take on the\r\nright of the 5th corps, after the latter reaching Dinwiddie Court House.\r\nMove your cavalry at as early an hour as you can, and without being\r\nconfined to any particular road or roads.  You may go out by the nearest\r\nroads in rear of the 5th corps, pass by its left, and passing near to or\r\nthrough Dinwiddie, reach the right and rear of the enemy as soon as you\r\ncan.  It is not the intention to attack the enemy in his intrenched\r\nposition, but to force him out, if possible. Should he come out and\r\nattack us, or get himself where he can be attacked, move in with your\r\nentire force in your own way, and with the full reliance that the army\r\nwill engage or follow, as circumstances will dictate.  I shall be on the\r\nfield, and will probably be able to communicate with you.  Should I not\r\ndo so, and you find that the enemy keeps within his main intrenched\r\nline, you may cut loose and push for the Danville Road.  If you find it\r\npracticable, I would like you to cross the South Side Road, between\r\nPetersburg and Burkesville, and destroy it to some extent.  I would not\r\nadvise much detention, however, until you reach the Danville Road, which\r\nI would like you to strike as near to the Appomattox as possible.  Make\r\nyour destruction on that road as complete as possible.  You can then\r\npass on to the South Side Road, west of Burkesville, and destroy that in\r\nlike manner.\r\n\r\n\"After having accomplished the destruction of the two railroads, which\r\nare now the only avenues of supply to Lee's army, you may return to this\r\narmy, selecting your road further south, or you may go on into North\r\nCarolina and join General Sherman.  Should you select the latter course,\r\nget the information to me as early as possible, so that I may send\r\norders to meet you at Goldsboro'.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 29th the movement commenced.  At night the cavalry\r\nwas at Dinwiddie Court House, and the left of our infantry line extended\r\nto the Quaker Road, near its intersection with the Boydton Plank Road.\r\nThe position of the troops from left to right was as follows:  Sheridan,\r\nWarren, Humphreys, Ord, Wright, Parke.\r\n\r\nEverything looked favorable to the defeat of the enemy and the capture\r\nof Petersburg and Richmond, if the proper effort was made.  I therefore\r\naddressed the following communication to General Sheridan, having\r\npreviously informed him verbally not to cut loose for the raid\r\ncontemplated in his orders until he received notice from me to do so:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"GRAVELLY CREEK, March 29, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:--Our line is now unbroken from the Appomattox to Dinwiddie.\r\nWe are all ready, however, to give up all, from the Jerusalem Plank Road\r\nto Hatcher's Run, whenever the forces can be used advantageously.  After\r\ngetting into line south of Hatcher's, we pushed forward to find the\r\nenemy's position. General Griffin was attacked near where the Quaker\r\nRoad intersects the Boydton Road, but repulsed it easily, capturing\r\nabout one hundred men.  Humphreys reached Dabney's Mill, and was pushing\r\non when last heard from.\r\n\r\n\"I now feel like ending the matter, if it is possible to do so, before\r\ngoing back.  I do not want you, therefore, to cut loose and go after the\r\nenemy's roads at present.  In the morning push around the enemy, if you\r\ncan, and get on to his right rear.  The movements of the enemy's cavalry\r\nmay, of course, modify your action.  We will act all together as one\r\narmy here, until it is seen what can be done with the enemy.  The\r\nsignal-officer at Cobb's Hill reported, at half-past eleven A.M., that a\r\ncavalry column had passed that point from Richmond towards Petersburg,\r\ntaking forty minutes to pass.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the night of the 29th to the morning of the 31st the rain fell in\r\nsuch torrents as to make it impossible to move a wheeled vehicle, except\r\nas corduroy roads were laid in front of them. During the 30th, Sheridan\r\nadvanced from Dinwiddie Court House towards Five Forks, where he found\r\nthe enemy in full force. General Warren advanced and extended his line\r\nacross the Boydton Plank Road to near the White Oak Road, with a view of\r\ngetting across the latter; but, finding the enemy strong in his front\r\nand extending beyond his left, was directed to hold on where he was, and\r\nfortify.  General Humphreys drove the enemy from his front into his main\r\nline on the Hatcher, near Burgess's Mills. Generals Ord, Wright, and\r\nParke made examinations in their fronts to determine the feasibility of\r\nan assault on the enemy's lines.  The two latter reported favorably.\r\nThe enemy confronting us as he did, at every point from Richmond to our\r\nextreme left, I conceived his lines must be weakly held, and could be\r\npenetrated if my estimate of his forces was correct.  I determined,\r\ntherefore, to extend our line no farther, but to reinforce General\r\nSheridan with a corps of infantry, and thus enable him to cut loose and\r\nturn the enemy's right flank, and with the other corps assault the\r\nenemy's lines.  The result of the offensive effort of the enemy the week\r\nbefore, when he assaulted Fort Stedman, particularly favored this.  The\r\nenemy's intrenched  picket-line captured by us at that time threw the\r\nlines occupied by the belligerents so close together at some points that\r\nit was but a moment's run from one to the other. Preparations were at\r\nonce made to relieve General Humphreys's corps, to report to General\r\nSheridan; but the condition of the roads prevented immediate movement.\r\nOn the morning of the 31st, General Warren reported favorably to getting\r\npossession of the White Oak Road, and was directed to do so.  To\r\naccomplish this, he moved with one division, instead of his whole corps,\r\nwhich was attacked by the enemy in superior force and driven back on the\r\n2d division before it had time to form, and it, in turn, forced back\r\nupon the 3d division, when the enemy was checked.  A division of the 2d\r\ncorps was immediately sent to his support, the enemy driven back with\r\nheavy loss, and possession of the White Oak Road gained.  Sheridan\r\nadvanced, and with a portion of his cavalry got possession of the Five\r\nForks; but the enemy, after the affair with the 5th corps, reinforced\r\nthe rebel cavalry, defending that point with infantry, and forced him\r\nback towards Dinwiddie Court House.  Here General Sheridan displayed\r\ngreat generalship.  Instead of retreating with his whole command on the\r\nmain army, to tell the story of superior forces encountered, he deployed\r\nhis cavalry on foot, leaving only mounted men enough to take charge of\r\nthe horses.  This compelled the enemy to deploy over a vast extent of\r\nwooded and broken country, and made his progress slow.  At this juncture\r\nhe dispatched to me what had taken place, and that he was dropping back\r\nslowly on Dinwiddie Court House.  General Mackenzie's cavalry and one\r\ndivision of the 5th corps were immediately ordered to his assistance.\r\nSoon after receiving a report from General Meade that Humphreys could\r\nhold our position on the Boydton Road, and that the other two divisions\r\nof the 5th corps could go to Sheridan, they were so ordered at once.\r\nThus the operations of the day necessitated the sending of Warren,\r\nbecause of his accessibility, instead of Humphreys, as was intended, and\r\nprecipitated intended movements.  On the morning of the 1st of April,\r\nGeneral Sheridan, reinforced by General Warren, drove the enemy back on\r\nFive Forks, where, late in the evening, he assaulted and carried his\r\nstrongly fortified position, capturing all his artillery and between\r\nfive and six thousand prisoners.\r\n\r\nAbout the close of this battle, Brevet Major-General Charles Griffin\r\nrelieved Major-General Warren in command of the 5th corps.  The report\r\nof this reached me after nightfall.  Some apprehensions filled my mind\r\nlest the enemy might desert his lines during the night, and by falling\r\nupon General Sheridan before assistance could reach him, drive him from\r\nhis position and open the way for retreat.  To guard against this,\r\nGeneral Miles's division of Humphreys's corps was sent to reinforce him,\r\nand a bombardment was commenced and kept up until four o'clock in the\r\nmorning (April 2), when an assault was ordered on the enemy's lines.\r\nGeneral Wright penetrated the lines with his whole corps, sweeping\r\neverything before him, and to his left towards Hatcher's Run, capturing\r\nmany guns and several thousand prisoners.  He was closely followed by\r\ntwo divisions of General Ord's command, until he met the other division\r\nof General Ord's that had succeeded in forcing the enemy's lines near\r\nHatcher's Run. Generals Wright and Ord immediately swung to the right,\r\nand closed all of the enemy on that side of them in Petersburg, while\r\nGeneral Humphreys pushed forward with two divisions and joined General\r\nWright on the left.  General Parke succeeded in carrying the enemy's\r\nmain line, capturing guns and prisoners, but was unable to carry his\r\ninner line.  General Sheridan being advised of the condition of affairs,\r\nreturned General Miles to his proper command.  On reaching the enemy's\r\nlines immediately surrounding Petersburg, a portion of General Gibbon's\r\ncorps, by a most gallant charge, captured two strong inclosed works--the\r\nmost salient and commanding south of Petersburg--thus materially\r\nshortening the line of investment necessary for taking in the city.  The\r\nenemy south of Hatcher's Run retreated westward to Sutherland's Station,\r\nwhere they were overtaken by Miles's division.  A severe engagement\r\nensued, and lasted until both his right and left flanks were threatened\r\nby the approach of General Sheridan, who was moving from Ford's Station\r\ntowards Petersburg, and a division sent by General Meade from the front\r\nof Petersburg, when he broke in the utmost confusion, leaving in our\r\nhands his guns and many prisoners.  This force retreated by the main\r\nroad along the Appomattox River.  During the night of the 2d the enemy\r\nevacuated Petersburg and Richmond, and retreated towards Danville.  On\r\nthe morning of the 3d pursuit was commenced.  General Sheridan pushed\r\nfor the Danville Road, keeping near the Appomattox, followed by General\r\nMeade with the 2d and 6th corps, while General Ord moved for\r\nBurkesville, along the South Side Road; the 9th corps stretched along\r\nthat road behind him.  On the 4th, General Sheridan struck the Danville\r\nRoad near Jetersville, where he learned that Lee was at Amelia Court\r\nHouse.  He immediately intrenched himself and awaited the arrival of\r\nGeneral Meade, who reached there the next day. General Ord reached\r\nBurkesville on the evening of the 5th.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 5th, I addressed Major-General Sherman the\r\nfollowing communication:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WILSON'S STATION, April 5, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:  All indications now are that Lee will attempt to reach\r\nDanville with the remnant of his force.  Sheridan, who was up with him\r\nlast night, reports all that is left, horse, foot, and dragoons, at\r\ntwenty thousand, much demoralized.  We hope to reduce this number\r\none-half.  I shall push on to Burkesville, and if a stand is made at\r\nDanville, will in a very few days go there.  If you can possibly do so,\r\npush on from where you are, and let us see if we cannot finish the job\r\nwith Lee's and Johnston's armies.  Whether it will be better for you to\r\nstrike for Greensboro', or nearer to Danville, you will be better able\r\nto judge when you receive this.  Rebel armies now are the only strategic\r\npoints to strike at.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 6th, it was found that General Lee was moving west\r\nof Jetersville, towards Danville.  General Sheridan moved with his\r\ncavalry (the 5th corps having been returned to General Meade on his\r\nreaching Jetersville) to strike his flank, followed by the 6th corps,\r\nwhile the 2d and 5th corps pressed hard after, forcing him to abandon\r\nseveral hundred wagons and several pieces of artillery.  General Ord\r\nadvanced from Burkesville towards Farmville, sending two regiments of\r\ninfantry and a squadron of cavalry, under Brevet Brigadier-General\r\nTheodore Read, to reach and destroy the bridges.  This advance met the\r\nhead of Lee's column near Farmville, which it heroically attacked and\r\ndetained until General Read was killed and his small force overpowered.\r\nThis caused a delay in the enemy's movements, and enabled General Ord to\r\nget well up with the remainder of his force, on meeting which, the enemy\r\nimmediately intrenched himself.  In the afternoon, General Sheridan\r\nstruck the enemy south of Sailors' Creek, captured sixteen pieces of\r\nartillery and about four hundred wagons, and detained him until the 6th\r\ncorps got up, when a general attack of infantry and cavalry was made,\r\nwhich resulted in the capture of six or seven thousand prisoners, among\r\nwhom were many general officers.  The movements of the 2d corps and\r\nGeneral Ord's command contributed greatly to the day's success.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 7th the pursuit was renewed, the cavalry, except\r\none division, and the 5th corps moving by Prince Edward's Court House;\r\nthe 6th corps, General Ord's command, and one division of cavalry, on\r\nFarmville; and the 2d corps by the High Bridge Road.  It was soon found\r\nthat the enemy had crossed to the north side of the Appomattox; but so\r\nclose was the pursuit, that the 2d corps got possession of the common\r\nbridge at High Bridge before the enemy could destroy it, and immediately\r\ncrossed over.  The 6th corps and a division of cavalry crossed at\r\nFarmville to its support.\r\n\r\nFeeling now that General Lee's chance of escape was utterly hopeless, I\r\naddressed him the following communication from Farmville:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"April 7, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL--The result of the last week must convince you of the\r\nhopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern\r\nVirginia in this struggle.  I feel that it is so, and regard it as my\r\nduty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion of\r\nblood, by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate\r\nStates army known as the Army of Northern Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"GENERAL R. E. LEE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 8th, before leaving, I received at Farmville\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"April 7, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:  I have received your note of this date.  Though not\r\nentertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of further\r\nresistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia, I reciprocate\r\nyour desire to avoid useless effusion of blood, and therefore, before\r\nconsidering your proposition, ask the terms you will offer on condition\r\nof its surrender.\r\n\r\n\"R. E. LEE, General.\r\n\"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this I immediately replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"April 8, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:--Your note of last evening, in reply to mine of same date,\r\nasking the condition on which I will accept the surrender of the Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia, is just received.  In reply, I would say, that peace\r\nbeing my great desire, there is but one condition I would insist upon\r\n--namely, That the men and officers surrendered shall be disqualified for\r\ntaking up arms again against the Government of the United States until\r\nproperly exchanged.  I will meet you, or will designate officers to meet\r\nany officers you may name for the same purpose, at any point agreeable\r\nto you, for the purpose of arranging definitely the terms upon which the\r\nsurrender of the Army of the Northern Virginia will be received.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"GENERAL R. E. LEE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 8th the pursuit was resumed. General Meade\r\nfollowed north of the Appomattox, and General Sheridan, with all the\r\ncavalry, pushed straight ahead for Appomattox Station, followed by\r\nGeneral Ord's command and the 5th corps. During the day General Meade's\r\nadvance had considerable fighting with the enemy's rear-guard, but was\r\nunable to bring on a general engagement.  Late in the evening General\r\nSheridan struck the railroad at Appomattox Station, drove the enemy from\r\nthere, and captured twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train,\r\nand four trains of cars loaded with supplies for Lee's army.  During\r\nthis day I accompanied General Meade's column, and about midnight\r\nreceived the following communication from General Lee:\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 8, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:--I received, at a late hour, your note of to-day.  In mine of\r\nyesterday I did not intend to propose the surrender of the Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia, but to ask the terms of your proposition.  To be\r\nfrank, I do not think the emergency has arisen to call for the surrender\r\nof this army; but as the restoration of peace should be the sole object\r\nof all, I desired to know whether your proposals would lead to that end.\r\nI cannot, therefore, meet you with a view to the surrender of the Army\r\nof Northern Virginia; but as far as your proposal may affect the\r\nConfederate States forces under my command, and tend to the restoration\r\nof peace, I should be pleased to meet you at ten A.M. to-morrow on the\r\nold stage-road to Richmond, between the picket-lines of the two armies.\r\n\r\n\"R. E. LEE, General.\r\n\"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 9th I returned him an answer as follows, and\r\nimmediately started to join the column south of the Appomattox:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"April 9, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:--Your note of yesterday is received.  I have no authority to\r\ntreat on the subject of peace; the meeting proposed for ten A.M. to-day\r\ncould lead to no good.  I will state, however, general, that I am\r\nequally anxious for peace with yourself, and the whole North entertains\r\nthe same feeling.  The terms upon which peace can be had are well\r\nunderstood.  By the South laying down their arms they will hasten that\r\nmost desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and hundreds of\r\nmillions of property not yet destroyed.  Seriously hoping that all our\r\ndifficulties may be settled without the loss of another life, I\r\nsubscribe myself, etc.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"GENERAL R. E. LEE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this morning of the 9th, General Ord's command and the 5th corps\r\nreached Appomattox Station just as the enemy was making a desperate\r\neffort to break through our cavalry.  The infantry was at once thrown\r\nin.  Soon after a white flag was received, requesting a suspension of\r\nhostilities pending negotiations for a surrender.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching General Sheridan's headquarters, I received the\r\nfollowing from General Lee:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"April 9, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:--I received your note of this morning on the picket-line,\r\nwhither I had come to meet you, and ascertain definitely what terms were\r\nembraced in your proposal of yesterday with reference to the surrender\r\nof this army.  I now ask an interview, in accordance with the offer\r\ncontained in your letter of yesterday, for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"R. E. LEE, General.\r\n\"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interview was held at Appomattox Court-House, the result of which is\r\nset forth in the following correspondence:\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPOMATTOX COURT-HOUSE, Virginia, April 9, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:  In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the\r\n8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of Northern\r\nVirginia on the following terms, to wit:  Rolls of all the officers and\r\nmen to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an officer to be\r\ndesignated by me, the other to be retained by such officer or officers\r\nas you may designate.  The officers to give their individual paroles not\r\nto take up arms against the Government of the United States until\r\nproperly exchanged; and each company or regimental commander sign a like\r\nparole for the men of their commands.  The arms, artillery, and public\r\nproperty to be parked and stacked, and turned over to the officers\r\nappointed by me to receive them.  This will not embrace the side-arms of\r\nthe officers, nor their private horses or baggage.  This done, each\r\nofficer and man will be allowed to return to his home, not to be\r\ndisturbed by United States authority so long as they observe their\r\nparoles and the laws in force where they may reside.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\"GENERAL R. E. LEE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:  I have received your letter of this date containing the terms\r\nof surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.  As\r\nthey are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the\r\n8th instant, they are accepted.  I will proceed to designate the proper\r\nofficers to carry the stipulations into effect.\r\n\r\n\"R. E. LEE, General.\r\n\"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe command of Major-General Gibbon, the 5th army corps under Griffin,\r\nand Mackenzie's cavalry, were designated to remain at Appomattox\r\nCourt-House until the paroling of the surrendered army was completed,\r\nand to take charge of the public property. The remainder of the army\r\nimmediately returned to the vicinity of Burkesville.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee's great influence throughout the whole South caused his\r\nexample to be followed, and to-day the result is that the armies lately\r\nunder his leadership are at their homes, desiring peace and quiet, and\r\ntheir arms are in the hands of our ordnance officers.\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of my letter of the 5th, General Sherman moved directly\r\nagainst Joe Johnston, who retreated rapidly on and through Raleigh,\r\nwhich place General Sherman occupied on the morning of the 13th.  The\r\nday preceding, news of the surrender of General Lee reached him at\r\nSmithfield.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th a correspondence was opened between General Sherman and\r\nGeneral Johnston, which resulted on the 18th in an agreement for a\r\nsuspension of hostilities, and a memorandum or basis for peace, subject\r\nto the approval of the President.  This agreement was disapproved by the\r\nPresident on the 21st, which disapproval, together with your\r\ninstructions, was communicated to General Sherman by me in person on the\r\nmorning of the 24th, at Raleigh, North Carolina, in obedience to your\r\norders.  Notice was at once given by him to General Johnston for the\r\ntermination of the truce that had been entered into.  On the 25th\r\nanother meeting between them was agreed upon, to take place on the 26th,\r\nwhich terminated in the surrender and disbandment of Johnston's army\r\nupon substantially the same terms as were given to General Lee.\r\n\r\nThe expedition under General Stoneman from East Tennessee got off on the\r\n20th of March, moving by way of Boone, North Carolina, and struck the\r\nrailroad at Wytheville, Chambersburg, and Big Lick.  The force striking\r\nit at Big Lick pushed on to within a few miles of Lynchburg, destroying\r\nthe important bridges, while with the main force he effectually\r\ndestroyed it between New River and Big Lick, and then turned for\r\nGreensboro', on the North Carolina Railroad; struck that road and\r\ndestroyed the bridges between Danville and Greensboro', and between\r\nGreensboro' and the Yadkin, together with the depots of supplies along\r\nit, and captured four hundred prisoners.  At Salisbury he attacked and\r\ndefeated a force of the enemy under General Gardiner, capturing fourteen\r\npieces of artillery and one thousand three hundred and sixty-four\r\nprisoners, and destroyed large amounts of army stores.  At this place he\r\ndestroyed fifteen miles of railroad and the bridges towards Charlotte.\r\nThence he moved to Slatersville.\r\n\r\nGeneral Canby, who had been directed in January to make preparations for\r\na movement from Mobile Bay against Mobile and the interior of Alabama,\r\ncommenced his movement on the 20th of March.  The 16th corps,\r\nMajor-General A. J. Smith commanding, moved from Fort Gaines by water to\r\nFish River; the 13th corps, under Major-General Gordon Granger, moved\r\nfrom Fort Morgan and joined the 16th corps on Fish River, both moving\r\nthence on Spanish Fort and investing it on the 27th; while Major-General\r\nSteele's command moved from Pensacola, cut the railroad leading from\r\nTensas to Montgomery, effected a junction with them, and partially\r\ninvested Fort Blakely.  After a severe bombardment of Spanish Fort, a\r\npart of its line was carried on the 8th of April.  During the night the\r\nenemy evacuated the fort.  Fort Blakely was carried by assault on the\r\n9th, and many prisoners captured; our loss was considerable.  These\r\nsuccesses practically opened to us the Alabama River, and enabled us to\r\napproach Mobile from the north.  On the night of the 11th the city was\r\nevacuated, and was taken possession of by our forces on the morning of\r\nthe 12th.\r\n\r\nThe expedition under command of Brevet Major-General Wilson, consisting\r\nof twelve thousand five hundred mounted men, was delayed by rains until\r\nMarch 22d, when it moved from Chickasaw, Alabama.  On the 1st of April,\r\nGeneral Wilson encountered the enemy in force under Forrest near\r\nEbenezer Church, drove him in confusion, captured three hundred\r\nprisoners and three guns, and destroyed the central bridge over the\r\nCahawba River.  On the 2d he attacked and captured the fortified city of\r\nSelma, defended by Forrest, with seven thousand men and thirty-two guns,\r\ndestroyed the arsenal, armory, naval foundry, machine-shops, vast\r\nquantities of stores, and captured three thousand prisoners.  On the 4th\r\nhe captured and destroyed Tuscaloosa.  On the 10th he crossed the\r\nAlabama River, and after sending information of his operations to\r\nGeneral Canby, marched on Montgomery, which place he occupied on the\r\n14th, the enemy having abandoned it.  At this place many stores and five\r\nsteamboats fell into our hands.  Thence a force marched direct on\r\nColumbus, and another on West Point, both of which places were assaulted\r\nand captured on the 16th.  At the former place we got one thousand five\r\nhundred prisoners and fifty-two field-guns, destroyed two gunboats, the\r\nnavy yard, foundries, arsenal, many factories, and much other public\r\nproperty.  At the latter place we got three hundred prisoners, four\r\nguns, and destroyed nineteen locomotives and three hundred cars.  On the\r\n20th he took possession of Macon, Georgia, with sixty field-guns, one\r\nthousand two hundred militia, and five generals, surrendered by General\r\nHowell Cobb.  General Wilson, hearing that Jeff. Davis was trying to\r\nmake his escape, sent forces in pursuit and succeeded in capturing him\r\non the morning of May 11th.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th day of May, General Dick Taylor surrendered to General Canby\r\nall the remaining rebel forces east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nA force sufficient to insure an easy triumph over the enemy under Kirby\r\nSmith, west of the Mississippi, was immediately put in motion for Texas,\r\nand Major-General Sheridan designated for its immediate command; but on\r\nthe 26th day of May, and before they reached their destination, General\r\nKirby Smith surrendered his entire command to Major-General Canby.  This\r\nsurrender did not take place, however, until after the capture of the\r\nrebel President and Vice-President; and the bad faith was exhibited of\r\nfirst disbanding most of his army and permitting an indiscriminate\r\nplunder of public property.\r\n\r\nOwing to the report that many of those lately in arms against the\r\ngovernment had taken refuge upon the soil of Mexico, carrying with them\r\narms rightfully belonging to the United States, which had been\r\nsurrendered to us by agreement among them some of the leaders who had\r\nsurrendered in person and the disturbed condition of affairs on the Rio\r\nGrande, the orders for troops to proceed to Texas were not changed.\r\n\r\nThere have been severe combats, raids, expeditions, and movements to\r\ndefeat the designs and purposes of the enemy, most of them reflecting\r\ngreat credit on our arms, and which contributed greatly to our final\r\ntriumph, that I have not mentioned.  Many of these will be found clearly\r\nset forth in the reports herewith submitted; some in the telegrams and\r\nbrief dispatches announcing them, and others, I regret to say, have not\r\nas yet been officially reported.\r\n\r\nFor information touching our Indian difficulties, I would respectfully\r\nrefer to the reports of the commanders of departments in which they have\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nIt has been my fortune to see the armies of both the West and the East\r\nfight battles, and from what I have seen I know there is no difference\r\nin their fighting qualities.  All that it was possible for men to do in\r\nbattle they have done.  The Western armies commenced their battles in\r\nthe Mississippi Valley, and received the final surrender of the remnant\r\nof the principal army opposed to them in North Carolina.  The armies of\r\nthe East commenced their battles on the river from which the Army of the\r\nPotomac derived its name, and received the final surrender of their old\r\nantagonists at Appomattox Court House, Virginia.  The splendid\r\nachievements of each have nationalized our victories removed all\r\nsectional jealousies (of which we have unfortunately experienced too\r\nmuch), and the cause of crimination and recrimination that might have\r\nfollowed had either section failed in its duty.  All have a proud\r\nrecord, and all sections can well congratulate themselves and each other\r\nfor having done their full share in restoring the supremacy of law over\r\nevery foot of territory belonging to the United States.  Let them hope\r\nfor perpetual peace and harmony with that enemy, whose manhood, however\r\nmistaken the cause, drew forth such herculean deeds of valor.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Very respectfully, your obedient servant, U. S.\r\nGRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n     __________\r\n     FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     (*1) Afterwards General Gardner, C.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*2) General Garland expressed a wish to get a message back to\r\n     General Twiggs, his division commander, or General Taylor, to\r\n     the effect that he was nearly out of ammunition and must have\r\n     more sent to him, or otherwise be reinforced.

He\r\n     recommended this uniformly, or at least frequently, in his\r\n     annual reports to the Secretary of War, but never got any\r\n     hearing.  Now, as he had conquered the state, he made\r\n     assessments upon the different large towns and cities occupied\r\n     by our troops, in proportion to their capacity to pay, and\r\n     appointed officers to receive the money.  In addition to the sum\r\n     thus realized he had derived, through capture at Cerro Gordo,\r\n     sales of captured government tobacco, etc., sums which swelled\r\n     the fund to a total of about $220,000.  Portions of this fund\r\n     were distributed among the rank and file, given to the wounded\r\n     in hospital, or applied in other ways, leaving a balance of some\r\n     $118,000 remaining unapplied at the close of the war.  After the\r\n     war was over and the troops all home, General Scott applied to\r\n     have this money, which had never been turned into the Treasury\r\n     of the United States, expended in establishing such homes as he\r\n     had previously recommended.  This fund was the foundation of the\r\n     Soldiers' Home at Washington City, and also one at Harrodsburgh,\r\n     Kentucky.\r\n\r\n     The latter went into disuse many years ago.  In fact it never\r\n     had many soldiers in it, and was, I believe, finally sold.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*5) The Mexican war made three presidential candidates, Scott,\r\n     Taylor and Pierce--and any number of aspirants for that high\r\n     office.  It made also governors of States, members of the\r\n     cabinet, foreign ministers and other officers of high rank both\r\n     in state and nation.  The rebellion, which contained more war in\r\n     a single day, at some critical periods, than the whole Mexican\r\n     war in two years, has not been so fruitful of political results\r\n     to those engaged on the Union side.  On the other side, the side\r\n     of the South, nearly every man who holds office of any sort\r\n     whatever, either in the state or in the nation, was a\r\n     Confederate soldier, but this is easily accounted for from the\r\n     fact that the South was a military camp, and there were very few\r\n     people of a suitable age to be in the army who were not in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*6) C. B. Lagow, the others not yet having joined me.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*7) NOTE.--Since writing this chapter I have received from Mrs.\r\n     W. H. L. Wallace, widow of the gallant general who was killed in\r\n     the first day's fight on the field of Shiloh, a letter from\r\n     General Lew. Wallace to him dated the morning of the 5th.  At\r\n     the date of this letter it was well known that the Confederates\r\n     had troops out along the Mobile & Ohio railroad west of Crump's\r\n     landing and Pittsburg landing, and were also collecting near\r\n     Shiloh.  This letter shows that at that time General Lew.\r\n     Wallace was making preparations for the emergency that might\r\n     happen for the passing of reinforcements between Shiloh and his\r\n     position, extending from Crump's landing westward, and he sends\r\n     it over the road running from Adamsville to the Pittsburg\r\n     landing and Purdy road.  These two roads intersect nearly a mile\r\n     west of the crossing of the latter over Owl Creek, where our\r\n     right rested.  In this letter General Lew. Wallace advises\r\n     General W. H. L. Wallace that he will send \"to-morrow\" (and his\r\n     letter also says \"April 5th,\" which is the same day the letter\r\n     was dated and which, therefore, must have been written on the\r\n     4th) some cavalry to report to him at his headquarters, and\r\n     suggesting the propriety of General W. H. L. Wallace's sending a\r\n     company back with them for the purpose of having the cavalry at\r\n     the two landings familiarize themselves with the road so that\r\n     they could \"act promptly in case of emergency as guides to and\r\n     from the different camps.\"\r\n\r\n     This modifies very materially what I have said, and what has\r\n     been said by others, of the conduct of General Lew. Wallace at\r\n     the battle of Shiloh.  It shows that he naturally, with no more\r\n     experience than he had at the time in the profession of arms,\r\n     would take the particular road that he did start upon in the\r\n     absence of orders to move by a different road.\r\n\r\n     The mistake he made, and which probably caused his apparent\r\n     dilatoriness, was that of advancing some distance after he found\r\n     that the firing, which would be at first directly to his front\r\n     and then off to the left, had fallen back until it had got very\r\n     much in rear of the position of his advance.  This falling back\r\n     had taken place before I sent General Wallace orders to move up\r\n     to Pittsburg landing and, naturally, my order was to follow the\r\n     road nearest the river.  But my order was verbal, and to a staff\r\n     officer who was to deliver it to General Wallace, so that I am\r\n     not competent to say just what order the General actually\r\n     received.\r\n\r\n     General Wallace's division was stationed, the First brigade at\r\n     Crump's landing, the Second out two miles, and the Third two and\r\n     a half miles out.  Hearing the sounds of battle General Wallace\r\n     early ordered his First and Third brigades to concentrate on the\r\n     Second.  If the position of our front had not changed, the road\r\n     which Wallace took would have been somewhat shorter to our right\r\n     than the River road.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n     MOUNT MACGREGOR, NEW YORK, June 21, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*8) NOTE:  In an article on the battle of Shiloh which I wrote\r\n     for the Century Magazine, I stated that General A. McD. McCook,\r\n     who commanded a division of Buell's army, expressed some\r\n     unwillingness to pursue the enemy on Monday, April 7th, because\r\n     of the condition of his troops.  General Badeau, in his history,\r\n     also makes the same statement, on my authority.  Out of justice\r\n     to General McCook and his command, I must say that they left a\r\n     point twenty-two miles east of Savannah on the morning of the\r\n     6th.  From the heavy rains of a few days previous and the\r\n     passage of trains and artillery, the roads were necessarily deep\r\n     in mud, which made marching slow.  The division had not only\r\n     marched through this mud the day before, but it had been in the\r\n     rain all night without rest.  It was engaged in the battle of\r\n     the second day and did as good service as its position\r\n     allowed.  In fact an opportunity occurred for it to perform a\r\n     conspicuous act of gallantry which elicited the highest\r\n     commendation from division commanders in the Army of the\r\n     Tennessee.  General Sherman both in his memoirs and report makes\r\n     mention of this fact.  General McCook himself belongs to a family\r\n     which furnished many volunteers to the army.  I refer to these\r\n     circumstances with minuteness because I did General McCook\r\n     injustice in my article in the Century, though not to the extent\r\n     one would suppose from the public press.  I am not willing to do\r\n     any one an injustice, and if convinced that I have done one, I\r\n     am always willing to make the fullest admission.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*9) NOTE.--For gallantry in the various engagements, from the\r\n     time I was left in command down to 26th of October and on my\r\n     recommendation, Generals McPherson and C. S. Hamilton were\r\n     promoted to be Major-Generals, and Colonels C. C. Marsh, 20th\r\n     Illinois, M. M. Crocker, 13th Iowa J. A. Mower, 11th Missouri,\r\n     M. D. Leggett, 78th Ohio, J. D. Stevenson, 7th Missouri, and\r\n     John E. Smith, 45th Illinois, to be Brigadiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*10) Colonel Ellet reported having attacked a Confederate\r\n     battery on the Red River two days before with one of his boats,\r\n     the De Soto.  Running aground, he was obliged to abandon his\r\n     vessel.  However, he reported that he set fire to her and blew\r\n     her up.  Twenty of his men fell into the hands of the enemy.\r\n     With the balance he escaped on the small captured steamer, the\r\n     New Era, and succeeded in passing the batteries at Grand Gulf\r\n     and reaching the vicinity of Vicksburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*11) One of Colonel Ellet's vessels which had run the blockade\r\n     on February the 2d and been sunk in the Red River.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*12) NOTE.--On this occasion Governor Richard Yates, of\r\n     Illinois, happened to be on a visit to the army and accompanied\r\n     me to Carthage.  I furnished an ambulance for his use and that\r\n     of some of the State officers who accompanied him.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*13) NOTE.--When General Sherman first learned of the move I\r\n     proposed to make, he called to see me about it.  I recollect\r\n     that I had transferred my headquarters from a boat in the river\r\n     to a house a short distance back from the levee.  I was seated\r\n     on the piazza engaged in conversation with my staff when Sherman\r\n     came up.  After a few moments' conversation he said that he would\r\n     like to see me alone.  We passed into the house together and shut\r\n     the door after us.  Sherman then expressed his alarm at the move\r\n     I had ordered, saying that I was putting myself in a position\r\n     voluntarily which an enemy would be glad to manoeuvre a year--or\r\n     a long time--to get me in.  I was going into the enemy's country,\r\n     with a large river behind me and the enemy holding points\r\n     strongly fortified above and below.  He said that it was an\r\n     axiom in war that when any great body of troops moved against an\r\n     enemy they should do so from a base of supplies, which they would\r\n     guard as they would the apple of the eye, etc.  He pointed out\r\n     all the difficulties that might be encountered in the campaign\r\n     proposed, and stated in turn what would be the true campaign to\r\n     make.  This was, in substance, to go back until high ground\r\n     could be reached on the east bank of the river; fortify there\r\n     and establish a depot of supplies, and move from there, being\r\n     always prepared to fall back upon it in case of disaster.  I\r\n     said this would take us back to Memphis.  Sherman then said that\r\n     was the very place he would go to, and would move by railroad\r\n     from Memphis to Grenada, repairing the road as we advanced.  To\r\n     this I replied, the country is already disheartened over the\r\n     lack of success on the part of our armies; the last election\r\n     went against the vigorous prosecution of the war, voluntary\r\n     enlistments had ceased throughout most of the North and\r\n     conscription was already resorted to, and if we went back so far\r\n     as Memphis it would discourage the people so much that bases of\r\n     supplies would be of no use:  neither men to hold them nor\r\n     supplies to put in them would be furnished.  The problem for us\r\n     was to move forward to a decisive victory, or our cause was\r\n     lost.  No progress was being made in any other field, and we had\r\n     to go on.\r\n\r\n     Sherman wrote to my adjutant general, Colonel J. A. Rawlins,\r\n     embodying his views of the campaign that should be made, and\r\n     asking him to advise me to at least get the views of my generals\r\n     upon the subject.  Colonel Rawlins showed me the letter, but I\r\n     did not see any reason for changing my plans.  The letter was\r\n     not answered and the subject was not subsequently mentioned\r\n     between Sherman and myself to the end of the war, that I\r\n     remember of.  I did not regard the letter as official, and\r\n     consequently did not preserve it.  General Sherman furnished a\r\n     copy himself to General Badeau, who printed it in his history of\r\n     my campaigns.  I did not regard either the conversation between\r\n     us or the letter to my adjutant-general as protests, but simply\r\n     friendly advice which the relations between us fully\r\n     justified.  Sherman gave the same energy to make the campaign a\r\n     success that he would or could have done if it had been ordered\r\n     by himself.  I make this statement here to correct an impression\r\n     which was circulated at the close of the war to Sherman's\r\n     prejudice, and for which there was no fair foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*14) Meant Edward's Station.\r\n\r\n     (*15) CHATTANOOGA, November 18, 1863.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN:\r\n\r\n     Enclosed herewith I send you copy of instructions to\r\n     Major-General Thomas.  You having been over the ground in\r\n     person, and having heard the whole matter discussed, further\r\n     instructions will not be necessary for you.  It is particularly\r\n     desirable that a force should be got through to the railroad\r\n     between Cleveland and Dalton, and Longstreet thus cut off from\r\n     communication with the South, but being confronted by a large\r\n     force here, strongly located, it is not easy to tell how this is\r\n     to be effected until the result of our first effort is known.\r\n\r\n     I will add, however, what is not shown in my instructions to\r\n     Thomas, that a brigade of cavalry has been ordered here which,\r\n     if it arrives in time, will be thrown across the Tennessee above\r\n     Chickamauga, and may be able to make the trip to Cleveland or\r\n     thereabouts.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT\r\n     Maj.-Gen'l.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CHATTANOOGA, November 18, 1863.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL GEO. H. THOMAS,\r\n     Chattanooga:\r\n\r\n     All preparations should be made for attacking the enemy's\r\n     position on Missionary Ridge by Saturday at daylight.  Not being\r\n     provided with a map giving names of roads, spurs of the\r\n     mountains, and other places, such definite instructions cannot\r\n     be given as might be desirable.  However, the general plan, you\r\n     understand, is for Sherman, with the force brought with him\r\n     strengthened by a division from your command, to effect a\r\n     crossing of the Tennessee River just below the mouth of\r\n     Chickamauga; his crossing to be protected by artillery from the\r\n     heights on the north bank of the river (to be located by your\r\n     chief of artillery), and to secure the heights on the northern\r\n     extremity to about the railroad tunnel before the enemy can\r\n     concentrate against him.  You will co-operate with Sherman.  The\r\n     troops in Chattanooga Valley should be well concentrated on your\r\n     left flank, leaving only the necessary force to defend\r\n     fortifications on the right and centre, and a movable column of\r\n     one division in readiness to move wherever ordered.  This\r\n     division should show itself as threateningly as possible on the\r\n     most practicable line for making an attack up the valley.  Your\r\n     effort then will be to form a junction with Sherman, making your\r\n     advance well towards the northern end of Missionary Ridge, and\r\n     moving as near simultaneously with him as possible.  The\r\n     junction once formed and the ridge carried, communications will\r\n     be at once established between the two armies by roads on the\r\n     south bank of the river.  Further movements will then depend on\r\n     those of the enemy.  Lookout Valley, I think, will be easily\r\n     held by Geary's division and what troops you may still have\r\n     there belonging to the old Army of the Cumberland.  Howard's\r\n     corps can then be held in readiness to act either with you at\r\n     Chattanooga or with Sherman.  It should be marched on Friday\r\n     night to a position on the north side of the river, not lower\r\n     down than the first pontoon-bridge, and there held in readiness\r\n     for such orders as may become necessary.  All these troops will\r\n     be provided with two days' cooked rations in haversacks, and one\r\n     hundred rounds of ammunition on the person of each infantry\r\n     soldier.  Special care should be taken by all officers to see\r\n     that ammunition is not wasted or unnecessarily fired away.  You\r\n     will call on the engineer department for such preparations as\r\n     you may deem necessary for carrying your infantry and artillery\r\n     over the creek.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*16) In this order authority was given for the troops to reform\r\n     after taking the first line of rifle-pits preparatory to carrying\r\n     the ridge.\r\n\r\n     (*17) CHATTANOOGA, November 24,1863.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL. CEO. H. THOMAS,\r\n     Chattanooga\r\n\r\n     General Sherman carried Missionary Ridge as far as the tunnel\r\n     with only slight skirmishing.  His right now rests at the tunnel\r\n     and on top of the hill, his left at Chickamauga Creek.  I have\r\n     instructed General Sherman to advance as soon as it is light in\r\n     the morning, and your attack, which will be simultaneous, will\r\n     be in cooperation.  Your command will either carry the\r\n     rifle-pits and ridge directly in front of them, or move to the\r\n     left, as the presence of the enemy may require.  If Hooker's\r\n     position on the mountain [cannot be maintained] with a small\r\n     force, and it is found impracticable to carry the top from where\r\n     he is, it would be advisable for him to move up the valley with\r\n     all the force he can spare, and ascend by the first practicable\r\n     road.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n\r\n     Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*18) WASHINGTON, D. C.,\r\n     December 8, 1863, 10.2 A.M.\r\n\r\n     MAJ.-GENERAL U. S. GRANT:\r\n\r\n     Understanding that your lodgment at Knoxville and at Chattanooga\r\n     is now secure, I wish to tender you, and all under your command,\r\n     my more than thanks, my profoundest gratitude for the skill,\r\n     courage, and perseverance with which you and they, over so great\r\n     difficulties, have effected that important object.  God bless you\r\n     all,\r\n\r\n     A. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n     President U. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*19) General John G.

The\r\n     scabbard was of gold, and was ornamented with a scroll running\r\n     nearly its entire length, displaying in engraved letters the\r\n     names of the battles in which General Grant had participated.\r\n\r\n     Congress also gave him a vote of thanks for the victories at\r\n     Chattanooga, and voted him a gold medal for Vicksburg and\r\n     Chattanooga. All such things are now in the possession of the\r\n     government at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*21) WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n     December 29, 1863.\r\n\r\n     MAJ.-GENERAL U. S.

C.,\r\n     April 4, 1864.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN,\r\n     Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n     GENERAL:--It is my design, if the enemy keep quiet and allow me\r\n     to take the initiative in the spring campaign, to work all parts\r\n     of the army together, and somewhat towards a common centre.  For\r\n     your information I now write you my programme, as at present\r\n     determined upon.\r\n\r\n     I have sent orders to Banks, by private messenger, to finish up\r\n     his present expedition against Shreveport with all dispatch; to\r\n     turn over the defence of Red River to General Steele and the\r\n     navy and to return your troops to you and his own to New\r\n     Orleans; to abandon all of Texas, except the Rio Grande, and to\r\n     hold that with not to exceed four thousand men; to reduce the\r\n     number of troops on the Mississippi to the lowest number\r\n     necessary to hold it, and to collect from his command not less\r\n     than twenty-five thousand men.  To this I will add five thousand\r\n     men from Missouri.  With this force he is to commence operations\r\n     against Mobile as soon as he can.  It will be impossible for him\r\n     to commence too early.\r\n\r\n     Gillmore joins Butler with ten thousand men, and the two operate\r\n     against Richmond from the south side of the James River.  This\r\n     will give Butler thirty-three thousand men to operate with, W.\r\n     F. Smith commanding the right wing of his forces and Gillmore\r\n     the left wing.  I will stay with the Army of the Potomac,\r\n     increased by Burnside's corps of not less than twenty-five\r\n     thousand effective men, and operate directly against Lee's army,\r\n     wherever it may be found.\r\n\r\n     Sigel collects all his available force in two columns, one,\r\n     under Ord and Averell, to start from Beverly, Virginia, and the\r\n     other, under Crook, to start from Charleston on the Kanawha, to\r\n     move against the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.\r\n\r\n     Crook will have all cavalry, and will endeavor to get in about\r\n     Saltville, and move east from there to join Ord.  His force will\r\n     be all cavalry, while Ord will have from ten to twelve thousand\r\n     men of all arms.\r\n\r\n     You I propose to move against Johnston's army, to break it up\r\n     and to get into the interior of the enemy's country as far as\r\n     you can, inflicting all the damage you can against their war\r\n     resources.\r\n\r\n     I do not propose to lay down for you a plan of campaign, but\r\n     simply lay down the work it is desirable to have done and leave\r\n     you free to execute it in your own way.  Submit to me, however,\r\n     as early as you can, your plan of operations.\r\n\r\n     As stated, Banks is ordered to commence operations as soon as he\r\n     can.  Gillmore is ordered to report at Fortress Monroe by the\r\n     18th inst., or as soon thereafter as practicable.  Sigel is\r\n     concentrating now.  None will move from their places of\r\n     rendezvous until I direct, except Banks.  I want to be ready to\r\n     move by the 25th inst., if possible.  But all I can now direct\r\n     is that you get ready as soon as possible.  I know you will have\r\n     difficulties to encounter in getting through the mountains to\r\n     where supplies are abundant, but I believe you will accomplish\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     From the expedition from the Department of West Virginia I do\r\n     not calculate on very great results; but it is the only way I\r\n     can take troops from there.  With the long line of railroad\r\n     Sigel has to protect, he can spare no troops except to move\r\n     directly to his front.  In this way he must get through to\r\n     inflict great damage on the enemy, or the enemy must detach from\r\n     one of his armies a large force to prevent it.  In other words,\r\n     if Sigel can't skin himself he can hold a leg while some one\r\n     else skins.\r\n\r\n     I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*24) See instructions to Butler, in General Grant's report,\r\n     Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*25) IN FIELD, CULPEPER C. H., VA.,\r\n     April 9, 1864.\r\n\r\n     MAJ.-GENERAL GEO. G. MEADE\r\n     Com'd'g Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\n     For information and as instruction to govern your preparations\r\n     for the coming campaign, the following is communicated\r\n     confidentially for your own perusal alone.\r\n\r\n     So far as practicable all the armies are to move together, and\r\n     towards one common centre.  Banks has been instructed to turn\r\n     over the guarding of the Red River to General Steele and the\r\n     navy, to abandon Texas with the exception of the Rio Grande, and\r\n     to concentrate all the force he can, not less than 25,000 men, to\r\n     move on Mobile.  This he is to do without reference to other\r\n     movements.  From the scattered condition of his command,\r\n     however, he cannot possibly get it together to leave New Orleans\r\n     before the 1st of May, if so soon.  Sherman will move at the same\r\n     time you do, or two or three days in advance, Jo. Johnston's army\r\n     being his objective point, and the heart of Georgia his ultimate\r\n     aim.  If successful he will secure the line from Chattanooga to\r\n     Mobile with the aid of Banks.\r\n\r\n     Sigel cannot spare troops from his army to reinforce either of\r\n     the great armies, but he can aid them by moving directly to his\r\n     front.  This he has been directed to do, and is now making\r\n     preparations for it.  Two columns of his command will make south\r\n     at the same time with the general move; one from Beverly, from\r\n     ten to twelve thousand strong, under Major-General Ord; the\r\n     other from Charleston, Va., principally cavalry, under\r\n     Brig.-General Crook.  The former of these will endeavor to reach\r\n     the Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, about south of Covington,\r\n     and if found practicable will work eastward to Lynchburg and\r\n     return to its base by way of the Shenandoah Valley, or join\r\n     you.  The other will strike at Saltville, Va., and come eastward\r\n     to join Ord.  The cavalry from Ord's command will try tributaries which\r\n     would furnish us an easy line over which to bring all supplies to\r\n     within easy hauling distance of every position the army could\r\n     occupy from the Rapidan to the James River.  But Lee could, if\r\n     he chose, detach or move his whole army north on a line rather\r\n     interior to the one I would have to take in following.  A\r\n     movement by his left--our right--would obviate this; but all\r\n     that was done would have to be done with the supplies and\r\n     ammunition we started with.  All idea of adopting this latter\r\n     plan was abandoned when the limited quantity of supplies\r\n     possible to take with us was considered.  The country over which\r\n     we would have to pass was so exhausted of all food or forage that\r\n     we would be obliged to carry everything with us.\r\n\r\n     While these preparations were going on the enemy was not\r\n     entirely idle.  In the West Forrest made a raid in West\r\n     Tennessee up to the northern border, capturing the garrison of\r\n     four or five hundred men at Union City, and followed it up by an\r\n     attack on Paducah, Kentucky, on the banks of the Ohio.  While he\r\n     was able to enter the city he failed to capture the forts or any\r\n     part of the garrison.  On the first intelligence of Forrest's\r\n     raid I telegraphed Sherman to send all his cavalry against him,\r\n     and not to let him get out of the trap he had put himself\r\n     into.  Sherman had anticipated me by sending troops against him\r\n     before he got my order.\r\n\r\n     Forrest, however, fell back rapidly, and attacked the troops at\r\n     Fort Pillow, a station for the protection of the navigation of\r\n     the Mississippi River.  The garrison to force a passage\r\n     southward, if they are successful in reaching the Virginia and\r\n     Tennessee Railroad, to cut the main lines of the road connecting\r\n     Richmond with all the South and South-west.\r\n\r\n     Gillmore will join Butler with about 10,000 men from South\r\n     Carolina. Butler can reduce his garrison so as to take 23,000\r\n     men into the field directly to his front.  The force will be\r\n     commanded by Maj.-General W. F. Smith.  With Smith and Gillmore,\r\n     Butler will seize City Point, and operate against Richmond from\r\n     the south side of the river.  His movement will be simultaneous\r\n     with yours.\r\n\r\n     Lee's army will be your objective point.  Wherever Lee goes,\r\n     there you will go also.  The only point upon which I am now in\r\n     doubt is, whether it will be better to cross the Rapidan above\r\n     or below him.  Each plan presents great advantages over the\r\n     other with corresponding objections.  By crossing above, Lee is\r\n     cut off from all chance of ignoring Richmond and going north on\r\n     a raid.  But if we take this route, all we do must be done\r\n     whilst the rations we start with hold out.  We separate from\r\n     Butler so that he cannot be directed how to co-operate.  By the\r\n     other route Brandy Station can be used as a base of supplies\r\n     until another is secured on the York or James rivers.\r\n\r\n     These advantages and objections I will talk over with you more\r\n     fully than I can write them.\r\n\r\n     Burnside with a force of probably 25,000 men will reinforce\r\n     you.  Immediately upon his arrival, which will be shortly after\r\n     the 20th inst., I will give him the defence of the road from\r\n     Bull Run as far south as we wish to hold it.  This will enable\r\n     you to collect all your strength about Brandy Station and to the\r\n     front.\r\n\r\n     There will be naval co-operation on the James River, and\r\n     transports and ferries will be provided so that should Lee fall\r\n     back into his intrenchments at Richmond, Butler's force and\r\n     yours will be a unit, or at least can be made to act as such.\r\n     What I would direct then, is that you commence at once reducing\r\n     baggage to the very lowest possible standard.  Two wagons to a\r\n     regiment of five hundred men is the greatest number that should\r\n     be allowed, for all baggage, exclusive of subsistence stores and\r\n     ordnance stores.  One wagon to brigade and one to division\r\n     headquarters is sufficient and about two to corps headquarters.\r\n\r\n     Should by Lee's right flank be our route, you will want to make\r\n     arrangements for having supplies of all sorts promptly forwarded\r\n     to White House on the Pamunkey.  Your estimates for this\r\n     contingency should be made at once.  If not wanted there, there\r\n     is every probability they will be wanted on the James River or\r\n     elsewhere.\r\n\r\n     If Lee's left is turned, large provision will have to be made\r\n     for ordnance stores.  I would say not much short of five hundred\r\n     rounds of infantry ammunition would do.  By the other, half the\r\n     amount would be sufficient.\r\n\r\n     U. S.

C.\r\n\r\n     I beg leave to recommend the following promotions be made for\r\n     gallant and distinguished services in the last eight days'\r\n     battles, to wit:  Brigadier-General H. G. Wright and\r\n     Brigadier-General John Gibbon to be Major-Generals; Colonel S.\r\n     S. Carroll, 8th Ohio Volunteers Colonel E. Upton, 121st New York\r\n     Volunteers; Colonel William McCandless, 2d Pennsylvania Reserves,\r\n     to be Brigadier-Generals. I would also recommend Major-General W.\r\n     S. Hancock for Brigadier-General in the regular army.  His\r\n     services and qualifications are eminently deserving of this\r\n     recognition.  In making these recommendations I do not wish the\r\n     claims of General G. M. Dodge for promotion forgotten, but\r\n     recommend his name to be sent in at the same time.  I would also\r\n     ask to have General Wright assigned to the command of the Sixth\r\n     Army Corps.  I would further ask the confirmation of General\r\n     Humphreys to the rank of Major-General.\r\n\r\n     General Meade has more than met my most sanguine expectations.\r\n     He and Sherman are the fittest officers for large commands I\r\n     have come in contact with.  If their services can be rewarded by\r\n     promotion to the rank of Major-Generals in the regular army the\r\n     honor would be worthily bestowed, and I would feel personally\r\n     gratified.  I would not like to see one of these promotions at\r\n     this time without seeing both.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*32) QUARLES' MILLS, VA., May 26, 1864.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK,\r\n     Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n     The relative position of the two armies is now as follows: Lee's\r\n     right rests on a swamp east of the Richmond and Fredericksburg\r\n     road and south of the North Anna, his centre on the river at Ox\r\n     Ford, and his left at Little River with the crossings of Little\r\n     River guarded as far up as we have gone. Hancock with his corps\r\n     and one division of the 9th corps crossed at Chesterfield Ford\r\n     and covers the right wing of Lee's army. One division of the 9th\r\n     corps is on the north bank of the Anna at Ox Ford, with bridges\r\n     above and below at points nearest to it where both banks are\r\n     held by us, so that it could reinforce either wing of our army\r\n     with equal facility.  The 5th and 6th corps with one division of\r\n     the 9th corps run from the south bank of the Anna from a short\r\n     distance above Ox Ford to Little River, and parallel with and\r\n     near to the enemy.\r\n\r\n     To make a direct attack from either wing would cause a slaughter\r\n     of our men that even success would not justify.  To turn the\r\n     enemy by his right, between the two Annas is impossible on\r\n     account of the swamp upon which his right rests.  To turn him by\r\n     the left leaves Little River, New Found River and South Anna\r\n     River, all of them streams presenting considerable obstacles to\r\n     the movement of our army, to be crossed.  I have determined\r\n     therefore to turn the enemy's right by crossing at or near\r\n     Hanover Town.  This crosses all three streams at once, and\r\n     leaves us still where we can draw supplies.\r\n\r\n     During the last night the teams and artillery not in position,\r\n     belonging to the right wing of our army, and one division of\r\n     that wing were quietly withdrawn to the north bank of the river\r\n     and moved down to the rear of the left.  As soon as it is dark\r\n     this division with most of the cavalry will commence a forced\r\n     march for Hanover Town to seize and hold the crossings.  The\r\n     balance of the right wing will withdraw at the same hour, and\r\n     follow as rapidly as possible.  The left wing will also withdraw\r\n     from the south bank of the river to-night and follow in rear of\r\n     the right wing.  Lee's army is really whipped.  The prisoners we\r\n     now take show it, and the action of his army shows it\r\n     unmistakably.  A battle with them outside of intrenchments\r\n     cannot be had.  Our men feel that they have gained the MORALE\r\n     over the enemy, and attack him with confidence.  I may be\r\n     mistaken, but I feel that our success over Lee's army is already\r\n     assured.  The promptness and rapidity with which you have\r\n     forwarded reinforcements has contributed largely to the feeling\r\n     of confidence inspired in our men, and to break down that of the\r\n     enemy.\r\n\r\n     We are destroying all the rails we can on the Central and\r\n     Fredericksburg roads.  I want to leave a gap on the roads north\r\n     of Richmond so big that to get a single track they will have to\r\n     import rail from elsewhere.  Even if a crossing is not effected\r\n     at Hanover Town it will probably be necessary for us to move on\r\n     down the Pamunkey until a crossing is effected.  I think it\r\n     advisable therefore to change our base of supplies from Port\r\n     Royal to the White House.  I wish you would direct this change\r\n     at once, and also direct Smith to put the railroad bridge there\r\n     in condition for crossing troops and artillery and leave men to\r\n     hold it.\r\n\r\n     U.

P.\r\n\r\n     The moment it becomes certain that an assault cannot succeed,\r\n     suspend the offensive; but when one does succeed, push it\r\n     vigorously and if necessary pile in troops at the successful\r\n     point from wherever they can be taken.  I shall go to where you\r\n     are in the course of an hour.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*34) COLD HARBOR, June 5,1864.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Chief of Staff of the Army, Washington,\r\n     D. C.\r\n\r\n     A full survey of all the ground satisfies me that it would be\r\n     impracticable to hold a line north-east of Richmond that would\r\n     protect the Fredericksburg Railroad to enable us to use that\r\n     road for supplying the army.  To do so would give us a long\r\n     vulnerable line of road to protect, exhausting much of our\r\n     strength to guard it, and would leave open to the enemy all of\r\n     his lines of communication on the south side of the James.  My\r\n     idea from the start has been to beat Lee's army if possible\r\n     north of Richmond; then after destroying his lines of\r\n     communication on the north side of the James River to transfer\r\n     the army to the south side and besiege Lee in Richmond, or\r\n     follow him south if he should retreat.\r\n\r\n     I now find, after over thirty days of trial, the enemy deems it\r\n     of the first importance to run no risks with the armies they now\r\n     have.  They act purely on the defensive behind breastworks, or\r\n     feebly on the offensive immediately in front of them, and where\r\n     in case of repulse they can instantly retire behind them.\r\n     Without a greater sacrifice of human life than I am willing to\r\n     make all cannot be accomplished that I had designed outside of\r\n     the city.  I have therefore resolved upon the following plan:\r\n\r\n     I will continue to hold substantially the ground now occupied by\r\n     the Army of the Potomac, taking advantage of any favorable\r\n     circumstance that may present itself until the cavalry can be\r\n     sent west to destroy the Virginia Central Railroad from about\r\n     Beaver Dam for some twenty-five or thirty miles west.  When this\r\n     is effected I will move the army to the south side of the James\r\n     River, either by crossing the Chickahominy and marching near to\r\n     City Point, or by going to the mouth of the Chickahominy on\r\n     north side and crossing there.  To provide for this last and\r\n     most possible contingency, several ferry-boats of the largest\r\n     class ought to be immediately provided.\r\n\r\n     Once on the south side of the James River, I can cut off all\r\n     sources of supply to the enemy except what is furnished by the\r\n     canal.  If Hunter succeeds in reaching Lynchburg, that will be\r\n     lost to him also.  Should Hunter not succeed, I will still make\r\n     the effort to destroy the canal by sending cavalry up the south\r\n     side of the river with a pontoon train to cross wherever they\r\n     can.\r\n\r\n     The feeling of the two armies now seems to be that the rebels\r\n     can protect themselves only by strong intrenchments, whilst our\r\n     army is not only confident of protecting itself without\r\n     intrenchments, but that it can beat and drive the enemy wherever\r\n     and whenever he can be found without this protection.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*35) COLD HARBOR, VA., June 6, 1864.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL D. HUNTER\r\n\r\n     Commanding Dept. W. Va.\r\n\r\n     General Sheridan leaves here to-morrow morning, with\r\n     instructions to proceed to Charlottesville, Va., and to commence\r\n     there the destruction of the Va. Cen. R. R., destroying this way\r\n     as much as possible.  The complete destruction of this road and\r\n     of the canal on James River is of great importance to us.\r\n     According to the instructions I sent to General Halleck for your\r\n     guidance, you were to proceed to Lynchburg and commence there. It\r\n     would be of great value to us to get possession of Lynchburg for\r\n     a single day.  But that point is of so much importance to the\r\n     enemy, that in attempting to get it such resistance may be met\r\n     as to defeat your getting onto the road or canal at all.  I see,\r\n     in looking over the letter to General Halleck on the subject of\r\n     your instructions, that it rather indicates that your route\r\n     should be from Staunton via Charlottesville.  If you have so\r\n     understood it, you will be doing just what I want.  The\r\n     direction I would now give is, that if this letter reaches you\r\n     in the valley between Staunton and Lynchburg, you immediately\r\n     turn east by the most practicable road.  From thence move\r\n     eastward along the line of the road, destroying it completely\r\n     and thoroughly, until you join General Sheridan.  After the work\r\n     laid out for General Sheridan and yourself is thoroughly done,\r\n     proceed to join the Army of the Potomac by the route laid out in\r\n     General Sheridan's instructions.\r\n\r\n     If any portion of your force, especially your cavalry, is needed\r\n     back in your Department, you are authorized to send it back.\r\n\r\n     If on receipt of this you should be near to Lynchburg and deem\r\n     it practicable to detach a cavalry force to destroy the canal.\r\n     Lose no opportunity to destroy the canal.\r\n\r\n     U.

They no doubt\r\n     expected troops from north of the James River to take their\r\n     place before we discovered it.  General Butler took advantage of\r\n     this and moved a force at once upon the railroad and plank road\r\n     between Richmond and Petersburg, which I hope to retain\r\n     possession of.\r\n\r\n     Too much credit cannot be given to the troops and their\r\n     commanders for the energy and fortitude displayed during the\r\n     last five days.  Day and night has been all the same, no delays\r\n     being allowed on any account.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieut.-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*38) CITY POINT, VA., July 24, 1864.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,\r\n     Commanding, etc.\r\n\r\n     The engineer officers who made a survey of the front from\r\n     Bermuda Hundred report against the probability of success from\r\n     an attack there.  The chances they think will be better on\r\n     Burnside's front.  If this is attempted it will be necessary to\r\n     concentrate all the force possible at the point in the enemy's\r\n     line we expect to penetrate.  All officers should be fully\r\n     impressed with the absolute necessity of pushing entirely beyond\r\n     the enemy's present line, if they should succeed in penetrating\r\n     it, and of getting back to their present line promptly if they\r\n     should not succeed in breaking through.\r\n\r\n     To the right and left of the point of assault all the artillery\r\n     possible should be brought to play upon the enemy in front\r\n     during the assault.  Their lines would be sufficient for the\r\n     support of the artillery, and all the reserves could be brought\r\n     on the flanks of their commands nearest to the point of assault,\r\n     ready to follow in if successful.  The field artillery and\r\n     infantry held in the lines during the first assault should be in\r\n     readiness to move at a moment's notice either to their front or\r\n     to follow the main assault, as they should receive orders.  One\r\n     thing, however, should be impressed on corps commanders.  If\r\n     they see the enemy giving away on their front or moving from it\r\n     to reinforce a heavily assaulted portion of their line, they\r\n     should take advantage of such knowledge and act promptly without\r\n     waiting for orders from army commanders.  General Ord can\r\n     co-operate with his corps in this movement, and about five\r\n     thousand troops from Bermuda Hundred can be sent to reinforce\r\n     you or can be used to threaten an assault between the Appomattox\r\n     and James rivers, as may be deemed best.\r\n\r\n     This should be done by Tuesday morning, if done at all.  If not\r\n     attempted, we will then start at the date indicated to destroy\r\n     the railroad as far as Hicksford at least, and to Weldon if\r\n     possible.\r\n\r\n             *        *        *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n     Whether we send an expedition on the road or assault at\r\n     Petersburg, Burnside's mine will be blown up....\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*39) See letter, August 5th, Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*40) See Appendix, letters of Oct. 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*41) CITY POINT, VA., December 2,1864.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,\r\n     Nashville Tenn.\r\n\r\n     If Hood is permitted to remain quietly about Nashville, you will\r\n     lose all the road back to Chattanooga and possibly have to\r\n     abandon the line of the Tennessee.  Should he attack you it is\r\n     all well, but if he does not you should attack him before he\r\n     fortifies.  Arm and put in the trenches your quartermaster\r\n     employees, citizens, etc.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CITY POINT, VA., December 2, 1864.--1.30 P.M.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,\r\n     Nashville, Tenn.\r\n\r\n     With your citizen employees armed, you can move out of Nashville\r\n     with all your army and force the enemy to retire or fight upon\r\n     ground of your own choosing.  After the repulse of Hood at\r\n     Franklin, it looks to me that instead of falling back to\r\n     Nashville we should have taken the offensive against the enemy\r\n     where he was.  At this distance, however, I may err as to the\r\n     best method of dealing with the enemy.  You will now suffer\r\n     incalculable injury upon your railroads if Hood is not speedily\r\n     disposed of.  Put forth therefore every possible exertion to\r\n     attain this end.  Should you get him to retreating give him no\r\n     peace.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CITY POINT, VA., December 5, 1864.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,\r\n     Nashville, Tenn.\r\n\r\n     Is there not danger of Forrest moving down the Cumberland to\r\n     where he can cross it?  It seems to me whilst you should be\r\n     getting up your cavalry as rapidly as possible to look after\r\n     Forrest, Hood should be attacked where he is.  Time strengthens\r\n     him in all possibility as much as it does you.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CITY POINT, VA., December 6, 1864--4 P.M.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,\r\n     Nashville, Tenn.\r\n\r\n     Attack Hood at once and wait no longer for a remnant of your\r\n     cavalry.  There is great danger of delay resulting in a campaign\r\n     back to the Ohio River.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CITY POINT, VA., December 8, 1864.--8.30 P.M.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,\r\n     Nashville, Tenn.\r\n\r\n     Your dispatch of yesterday received.  It looks to me evident the\r\n     enemy are trying to cross the Cumberland River, and are\r\n     scattered.  Why not attack at once?  By all means avoid the\r\n     contingency of a foot race to see which, you or Hood, can beat\r\n     to the Ohio.  If you think necessary call on the governors of\r\n     States to send a force into Louisville to meet the enemy if he\r\n     should cross the river.  You clearly never should cross except\r\n     in rear of the enemy.  Now is one of the finest opportunities\r\n     ever presented of destroying one of the three armies of the\r\n     enemy.  If destroyed he never can replace it.  Use the means at\r\n     your command, and you can do this and cause a rejoicing that\r\n     will resound from one end of the land to the other.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CITY POINT, VA., December 11, 1864.--4 P.M.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,\r\n     Nashville, Tenn.\r\n\r\n     If you delay attack longer the mortifying spectacle will be\r\n     witnessed of a rebel army moving for the Ohio River, and you\r\n     will be forced to act, accepting such weather as you find.  Let\r\n     there be no further delay.  Hood cannot even stand a drawn\r\n     battle so far from his supplies of ordnance stores.  If he\r\n     retreats and you follow, he must lose his material and much of\r\n     his army.  I am in hopes of receiving a dispatch from you to-day\r\n     announcing that you have moved.  Delay no longer for weather or\r\n     reinforcements.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON, D. C., December 15, 1864.\r\n\r\n     MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS,\r\n     Nashville, Tenn.\r\n\r\n     I was just on my way to Nashville, but receiving a dispatch from\r\n     Van Duzer detailing your splendid success of to-day, I shall go\r\n     no further.  Push the enemy now and give him no rest until he is\r\n     entirely destroyed.  Your army will cheerfully suffer many\r\n     privations to break up Hood's army and render it useless for\r\n     future operations.  Do not stop for trains or supplies, but take\r\n     them from the country as the enemy have done.  Much is now\r\n     expected.\r\n\r\n     U. S. GRANT,\r\n     Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*42) See orders to Major-General Meade, Ord, and Sheridan,\r\n     March 24th, Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*43) See Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (*44) NOTE.--The fac-simile of the terms of Lee's surrender\r\n     inserted at this place, was copied from the original document\r\n     furnished the publishers through the courtesy of General Ely S.\r\n     Parker, Military Secretary on General Grant's staff at the time\r\n     of the surrender.\r\n\r\n     Three pages of paper were prepared in General Grant's manifold\r\n     order book on which he wrote the terms, and the interlineations\r\n     and erasures were added by General Parker at the suggestion of\r\n     General Grant.  After such alteration it was handed to General\r\n     Lee, who put on his glasses, read it, and handed it back to\r\n     General Grant.  The original was then transcribed by General\r\n     Parker upon official headed paper and a copy furnished General\r\n     Lee.\r\n\r\n     The fac-simile herewith shows the color of the paper of the\r\n     original document and all interlineations and erasures.\r\n\r\n     There is a popular error to the effect that Generals Grant and\r\n     Lee each signed the articles of surrender.  The document in the\r\n     form of a letter was signed only by General Grant, in the parlor\r\n     of McLean's house while General Lee was sitting in the room, and\r\n     General Lee immediately wrote a letter accepting the terms and\r\n     handed it to General Grant.",
