The nature and character of slavery have been subjects of an\r\nalmost endless variety of artistic representation; and after the\r\nbrilliant achievements in that field, and while those achievements are\r\nyet fresh in the memory of the million, he who would add another to the\r\nlegion, must possess the charm of transcendent excellence, or apologize\r\nfor something worse than rashness. The reader is, therefore, assured,\r\nwith all due promptitude, that his attention is not invited to a work\r\nof ART, but to a work of FACTS—Facts, terrible and almost incredible,\r\nit may be yet FACTS, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nI am authorized to say that there is not a fictitious name nor place in\r\nthe whole volume; but that names and places are literally given, and\r\nthat every transaction therein described actually transpired.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best Preface to this volume is furnished in the following\r\nletter of Mr. Douglass, written in answer to my urgent solicitation for\r\nsuch a work:\r\n\r\nROCHESTER, N. Y. _July_ 2, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND: I have long entertained, as you very well know, a somewhat\r\npositive repugnance to writing or speaking anything for the public,\r\nwhich could, with any degree of plausibilty, make me liable to the\r\nimputation of seeking personal notoriety, for its own sake.\r\nEntertaining that feeling very sincerely, and permitting its control,\r\nperhaps, quite unreasonably, I have often refused to narrate my\r\npersonal experience in public anti-slavery meetings, and in\r\nsympathizing circles, when urged to do so by friends, with whose views\r\nand wishes, ordinarily, it were a pleasure to comply. In my letters and\r\nspeeches, I have generally aimed to discuss the question of Slavery in\r\nthe light of fundamental principles, and upon facts, notorious and open\r\nto all; making, I trust, no more of the fact of my own former\r\nenslavement, than circumstances seemed absolutely to require. I have\r\nnever placed my opposition to slavery on a basis so narrow as my own\r\nenslavement, but rather upon the indestructible and unchangeable laws\r\nof human nature, every one of which is perpetually and flagrantly\r\nviolated by the slave system. I have also felt that it was best for\r\nthose having histories worth the writing—or supposed to be so—to commit\r\nsuch work to hands other than their own. To write of one’s self, in\r\nsuch a manner as not to incur the imputation of weakness, vanity, and\r\negotism, is a work within the ability of but few; and I have little\r\nreason to believe that I belong to that fortunate few.\r\n\r\nThese considerations caused me to hesitate, when first you kindly urged\r\nme to prepare for publication a full account of my life as a slave, and\r\nmy life as a freeman.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I see, with you, many reasons for regarding my\r\nautobiography as exceptional in its character, and as being, in some\r\nsense, naturally beyond the reach of those reproaches which honorable\r\nand sensitive minds dislike to incur. It is not to illustrate any\r\nheroic achievements of a man, but to vindicate a just and beneficent\r\nprinciple, in its application to the whole human family, by letting in\r\nthe light of truth upon a system, esteemed by some as a blessing, and\r\nby others as a curse and a crime. I agree with you, that this system is\r\nnow at the bar of public opinion—not only of this country, but of the\r\nwhole civilized world—for judgment. Its friends have made for it the\r\nusual plea—“not guilty;” the case must, therefore, proceed. Any facts,\r\neither from slaves, slaveholders, or by-standers, calculated to\r\nenlighten the public mind, by revealing the true nature, character, and\r\ntendency of the slave system, are in order, and can scarcely be\r\ninnocently withheld.\r\n\r\nI see, too, that there are special reasons why I should write my own\r\nbiography, in preference to employing another to do it. Not only is\r\nslavery on trial, but unfortunately, the enslaved people are also on\r\ntrial. It is alleged, that they are, naturally, inferior; that they are\r\n_so low_ in the scale of humanity, and so utterly stupid, that they are\r\nunconscious of their wrongs, and do not apprehend their rights.\r\nLooking, then, at your request, from this stand-point, and wishing\r\neverything of which you think me capable to go to the benefit of my\r\nafflicted people, I part with my doubts and hesitation, and proceed to\r\nfurnish you the desired manuscript; hoping that you may be able to make\r\nsuch arrangements for its publication as shall be best adapted to\r\naccomplish that good which you so enthusiastically anticipate.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS\r\n\r\nThere was little necessity for doubt and hesitation on the part of Mr.\r\nDouglass, as to the propriety of his giving to the world a full account\r\nof himself. A man who was born and brought up in slavery, a living\r\nwitness of its horrors; who often himself experienced its cruelties;\r\nand who, despite the depressing influences surrounding his birth, youth\r\nand manhood, has risen, from a dark and almost absolute obscurity, to\r\nthe distinguished position which he now occupies, might very well\r\nassume the existence of a commendable curiosity, on the part of the\r\npublic, to know the facts of his remarkable history.\r\n\r\nEDITOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a man raises himself from the lowest condition in society to the\r\nhighest, mankind pay him the tribute of their admiration; when he\r\naccomplishes this elevation by native energy, guided by prudence and\r\nwisdom, their admiration is increased; but when his course, onward and\r\nupward, excellent in itself, furthermore proves a possible, what had\r\nhitherto been regarded as an impossible, reform, then he becomes a\r\nburning and a shining light, on which the aged may look with gladness,\r\nthe young with hope, and the down-trodden, as a representative of what\r\nthey may themselves become. To such a man, dear reader, it is my\r\nprivilege to introduce you.\r\n\r\nThe life of Frederick Douglass, recorded in the pages which follow, is\r\nnot merely an example of self-elevation under the most adverse\r\ncircumstances; it is, moreover, a noble vindication of the highest aims\r\nof the American anti-slavery movement. The real object of that movement\r\nis not only to disenthrall, it is, also, to bestow upon the Negro the\r\nexercise of all those rights, from the possession of which he has been\r\nso long debarred.\r\n\r\nBut this full recognition of the colored man to the right, and the\r\nentire admission of the same to the full privileges, political,\r\nreligious and social, of manhood, requires powerful effort on the part\r\nof the enthralled, as well as on the part of those who would\r\ndisenthrall them. The people at large must feel the conviction, as well\r\nas admit the abstract logic, of human equality; the Negro, for the\r\nfirst time in the world’s history, brought in full contact with high\r\ncivilization, must prove his title first to all that is demanded for\r\nhim; in the teeth of unequal chances, he must prove himself equal to\r\nthe mass of those who oppress him—therefore, absolutely superior to his\r\napparent fate, and to their relative ability. And it is most cheering\r\nto the friends of freedom, today, that evidence of this equality is\r\nrapidly accumulating, not from the ranks of the half-freed colored\r\npeople of the free states, but from the very depths of slavery itself;\r\nthe indestructible equality of man to man is demonstrated by the ease\r\nwith which black men, scarce one remove from barbarism—if slavery can\r\nbe honored with such a distinction—vault into the high places of the\r\nmost advanced and painfully acquired civilization. Ward and Garnett,\r\nWells Brown and Pennington, Loguen and Douglass, are banners on the\r\nouter wall, under which abolition is fighting its most successful\r\nbattles, because they are living exemplars of the practicability of the\r\nmost radical abolitionism; for, they were all of them born to the doom\r\nof slavery, some of them remained slaves until adult age, yet they all\r\nhave not only won equality to their white fellow citizens, in civil,\r\nreligious, political and social rank, but they have also illustrated\r\nand adorned our common country by their genius, learning and eloquence.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics whereby Mr. Douglass has won first rank among these\r\nremarkable men, and is still rising toward highest rank among living\r\nAmericans, are abundantly laid bare in the book before us. Like the\r\nautobiography of Hugh Miller, it carries us so far back into early\r\nchildhood, as to throw light upon the question, “when positive and\r\npersistent memory begins in the human being.” And, like Hugh Miller, he\r\nmust have been a shy old-fashioned child, occasionally oppressed by\r\nwhat he could not well account for, peering and poking about among the\r\nlayers of right and wrong, of tyrant and thrall, and the wonderfulness\r\nof that hopeless tide of things which brought power to one race, and\r\nunrequited toil to another, until, finally, he stumbled upon his\r\n“first-found Ammonite,” hidden away down in the depths of his own\r\nnature, and which revealed to him the fact that liberty and right, for\r\nall men, were anterior to slavery and wrong. When his knowledge of the\r\nworld was bounded by the visible horizon on Col. Lloyd’s plantation,\r\nand while every thing around him bore a fixed, iron stamp, as if it had\r\nalways been so, this was, for one so young, a notable discovery.\r\n\r\nTo his uncommon memory, then, we must add a keen and accurate insight\r\ninto men and things; an original breadth of common sense which enabled\r\nhim to see, and weigh, and compare whatever passed before him, and\r\nwhich kindled a desire to search out and define their relations to\r\nother things not so patent, but which never succumbed to the marvelous\r\nnor the supernatural; a sacred thirst for liberty and for learning,\r\nfirst as a means of attaining liberty, then as an end in itself most\r\ndesirable; a will; an unfaltering energy and determination to obtain\r\nwhat his soul pronounced desirable; a majestic self-hood; determined\r\ncourage; a deep and agonizing sympathy with his embruted, crushed and\r\nbleeding fellow slaves, and an extraordinary depth of passion, together\r\nwith that rare alliance between passion and intellect, which enables\r\nthe former, when deeply roused, to excite, develop and sustain the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nWith these original gifts in view, let us look at his schooling; the\r\nfearful discipline through which it pleased God to prepare him for the\r\nhigh calling on which he has since entered—the advocacy of emancipation\r\nby the people who are not slaves. And for this special mission, his\r\nplantation education was better than any he could have acquired in any\r\nlettered school. What he needed, was facts and experiences, welded to\r\nacutely wrought up sympathies, and these he could not elsewhere have\r\nobtained, in a manner so peculiarly adapted to his nature. His physical\r\nbeing was well trained, also, running wild until advanced into boyhood;\r\nhard work and light diet, thereafter, and a skill in handicraft in\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nFor his special mission, then, this was, considered in connection with\r\nhis natural gifts, a good schooling; and, for his special mission, he\r\ndoubtless “left school” just at the proper moment. Had he remained\r\nlonger in slavery—had he fretted under bonds until the ripening of\r\nmanhood and its passions, until the drear agony of slave-wife and\r\nslave-children had been piled upon his already bitter experiences—then,\r\nnot only would his own history have had another termination, but the\r\ndrama of American slavery would have been essentially varied; for I\r\ncannot resist the belief, that the boy who learned to read and write as\r\nhe did, who taught his fellow slaves these precious acquirements as he\r\ndid, who plotted for their mutual escape as he did, would, when a man\r\nat bay, strike a blow which would make slavery reel and stagger.\r\nFurthermore, blows and insults he bore, at the moment, without\r\nresentment; deep but suppressed emotion rendered him insensible to\r\ntheir sting; but it was afterward, when the memory of them went\r\nseething through his brain, breeding a fiery indignation at his injured\r\nself-hood, that the resolve came to resist, and the time fixed when to\r\nresist, and the plot laid, how to resist; and he always kept his\r\nself-pledged word. In what he undertook, in this line, he looked fate\r\nin the face, and had a cool, keen look at the relation of means to\r\nends. Henry Bibb, to avoid chastisement, strewed his master’s bed with\r\ncharmed leaves and _was whipped_. Frederick Douglass quietly pocketed a\r\nlike _fetiche_, compared his muscles with those of Covey—and _whipped\r\nhim_.\r\n\r\nIn the history of his life in bondage, we find, well developed, that\r\ninherent and continuous energy of character which will ever render him\r\ndistinguished. What his hand found to do, he did with his might; even\r\nwhile conscious that he was wronged out of his daily earnings, he\r\nworked, and worked hard. At his daily labor he went with a will; with\r\nkeen, well set eye, brawny chest, lithe figure, and fair sweep of arm,\r\nhe would have been king among calkers, had that been his mission.\r\n\r\nIt must not be overlooked, in this glance at his education, that Mr.\r\nDouglass lacked one aid to which so many men of mark have been deeply\r\nindebted—he had neither a mother’s care, nor a mother’s culture, save\r\nthat which slavery grudgingly meted out to him. Bitter nurse! may not\r\neven her features relax with human feeling, when she gazes at such\r\noffspring! How susceptible he was to the kindly influences of\r\nmother-culture, may be gathered from his own words, on page 57: “It has\r\nbeen a life-long standing grief to me, that I know so little of my\r\nmother, and that I was so early separated from her. The counsels of her\r\nlove must have been beneficial to me. The side view of her face is\r\nimaged on my memory, and I take few steps in life, without feeling her\r\npresence; but the image is mute, and I have no striking words of hers\r\ntreasured up.”\r\n\r\nFrom the depths of chattel slavery in Maryland, our author escaped into\r\nthe caste-slavery of the north, in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Here he\r\nfound oppression assuming another, and hardly less bitter, form; of\r\nthat very handicraft which the greed of slavery had taught him, his\r\nhalf-freedom denied him the exercise for an honest living; he found\r\nhimself one of a class—free colored men—whose position he has described\r\nin the following words:\r\n\r\n“Aliens are we in our native land. The fundamental principles of the\r\nrepublic, to which the humblest white man, whether born here or\r\nelsewhere, may appeal with confidence, in the hope of awakening a\r\nfavorable response, are held to be inapplicable to us. The glorious\r\ndoctrines of your revolutionary fathers, and the more glorious\r\nteachings of the Son of God, are construed and applied against us. We\r\nare literally scourged beyond the beneficent range of both authorities,\r\nhuman and divine. * * * * American humanity hates us, scorns us,\r\ndisowns and denies, in a thousand ways, our very personality. The\r\noutspread wing of American christianity, apparently broad enough to\r\ngive shelter to a perishing world, refuses to cover us. To us, its\r\nbones are brass, and its features iron. In running thither for shelter\r\nand succor, we have only fled from the hungry blood-hound to the\r\ndevouring wolf—from a corrupt and selfish world, to a hollow and\r\nhypocritical church.”—_Speech before American and Foreign Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety, May_, 1854.\r\n\r\nFour years or more, from 1837 to 1841, he struggled on, in New Bedford,\r\nsawing wood, rolling casks, or doing what labor he might, to support\r\nhimself and young family; four years he brooded over the scars which\r\nslavery and semi-slavery had inflicted upon his body and soul; and\r\nthen, with his wounds yet unhealed, he fell among the Garrisonians—a\r\nglorious waif to those most ardent reformers. It happened one day, at\r\nNantucket, that he, diffidently and reluctantly, was led to address an\r\nanti-slavery meeting. He was about the age when the younger Pitt\r\nentered the House of Commons; like Pitt, too, he stood up a born\r\norator.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, who was happily present, writes thus of Mr.\r\nDouglass’ maiden effort; “I shall never forget his first speech at the\r\nconvention—the extraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind—the\r\npowerful impression it created upon a crowded auditory, completely\r\ntaken by surprise. * * * I think I never hated slavery so intensely as\r\nat that moment; certainly, my perception of the enormous outrage which\r\nis inflicted by it on the godlike nature of its victims, was rendered\r\nfar more clear than ever. There stood one in physical proportions and\r\nstature commanding and exact—in intellect richly endowed—in natural\r\neloquence a prodigy.” 1\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to compare Mr. Douglass’s account of this meeting\r\nwith Mr. Garrison’s. Of the two, I think the latter the most correct.\r\nIt must have been a grand burst of eloquence! The pent up agony,\r\nindignation and pathos of an abused and harrowed boyhood and youth,\r\nbursting out in all their freshness and overwhelming earnestness!\r\n\r\nThis unique introduction to its great leader, led immediately to the\r\nemployment of Mr. Douglass as an agent by the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety. So far as his self-relying and independent character would\r\npermit, he became, after the strictest sect, a Garrisonian. It is not\r\ntoo much to say, that he formed a complement which they needed, and\r\nthey were a complement equally necessary to his “make-up.” With his\r\ndeep and keen sensitiveness to wrong, and his wonderful memory, he came\r\nfrom the land of bondage full of its woes and its evils, and painting\r\nthem in characters of living light; and, on his part, he found, told\r\nout in sound Saxon phrase, all those principles of justice and right\r\nand liberty, which had dimly brooded over the dreams of his youth,\r\nseeking definite forms and verbal expression. It must have been an\r\nelectric flashing of thought, and a knitting of soul, granted to but\r\nfew in this life, and will be a life-long memory to those who\r\nparticipated in it. In the society, moreover, of Wendell Phillips,\r\nEdmund Quincy, William Lloyd Garrison, and other men of earnest faith\r\nand refined culture, Mr. Douglass enjoyed the high advantage of their\r\nassistance and counsel in the labor of self-culture, to which he now\r\naddressed himself with wonted energy. Yet, these gentlemen, although\r\nproud of Frederick Douglass, failed to fathom, and bring out to the\r\nlight of day, the highest qualities of his mind; the force of their own\r\neducation stood in their own way: they did not delve into the mind of a\r\ncolored man for capacities which the pride of race led them to believe\r\nto be restricted to their own Saxon blood. Bitter and vindictive\r\nsarcasm, irresistible mimicry, and a pathetic narrative of his own\r\nexperiences of slavery, were the intellectual manifestations which they\r\nencouraged him to exhibit on the platform or in the lecture desk.\r\n\r\nA visit to England, in 1845, threw Mr. Douglass among men and women of\r\nearnest souls and high culture, and who, moreover, had never drank of\r\nthe bitter waters of American caste. For the first time in his life, he\r\nbreathed an atmosphere congenial to the longings of his spirit, and\r\nfelt his manhood free and unrestricted. The cordial and manly greetings\r\nof the British and Irish audiences in public, and the refinement and\r\nelegance of the social circles in which he mingled, not only as an\r\nequal, but as a recognized man of genius, were, doubtless, genial and\r\npleasant resting places in his hitherto thorny and troubled journey\r\nthrough life. There are joys on the earth, and, to the wayfaring\r\nfugitive from American slavery or American caste, this is one of them.\r\n\r\nBut his sojourn in England was more than a joy to Mr. Douglass. Like\r\nthe platform at Nantucket, it awakened him to the consciousness of new\r\npowers that lay in him. From the pupilage of Garrisonism he rose to the\r\ndignity of a teacher and a thinker; his opinions on the broader aspects\r\nof the great American question were earnestly and incessantly sought,\r\nfrom various points of view, and he must, perforce, bestir himself to\r\ngive suitable answer. With that prompt and truthful perception which\r\nhas led their sisters in all ages of the world to gather at the feet\r\nand support the hands of reformers, the gentlewomen of England 2 were\r\nforemost to encourage and strengthen him to carve out for himself a\r\npath fitted to his powers and energies, in the life-battle against\r\nslavery and caste to which he was pledged. And one stirring thought,\r\ninseparable from the British idea of the evangel of freedom, must have\r\nsmote his ear from every side—\r\n\r\nHereditary bondmen! know ye not\r\nWho would be free, themselves mast strike the blow?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of this visit was, that on his return to the United States,\r\nhe established a newspaper. This proceeding was sorely against the\r\nwishes and the advice of the leaders of the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety, but our author had fully grown up to the conviction of a truth\r\nwhich they had once promulged, but now forgotten, to wit: that in their\r\nown elevation—self-elevation—colored men have a blow to strike “on\r\ntheir own hook,” against slavery and caste. Differing from his Boston\r\nfriends in this matter, diffident in his own abilities, reluctant at\r\ntheir dissuadings, how beautiful is the loyalty with which he still\r\nclung to their principles in all things else, and even in this.\r\n\r\nNow came the trial hour. Without cordial support from any large body of\r\nmen or party on this side the Atlantic, and too far distant in space\r\nand immediate interest to expect much more, after the much already\r\ndone, on the other side, he stood up, almost alone, to the arduous\r\nlabor and heavy expenditure of editor and lecturer. The Garrison party,\r\nto which he still adhered, did not want a _colored_ newspaper—there was\r\nan odor of _caste_ about it; the Liberty party could hardly be expected\r\nto give warm support to a man who smote their principles as with a\r\nhammer; and the wide gulf which separated the free colored people from\r\nthe Garrisonians, also separated them from their brother, Frederick\r\nDouglass.\r\n\r\nThe arduous nature of his labors, from the date of the establishment of\r\nhis paper, may be estimated by the fact, that anti-slavery papers in\r\nthe United States, even while organs of, and when supported by,\r\nanti-slavery parties, have, with a single exception, failed to pay\r\nexpenses. Mr. Douglass has maintained, and does maintain, his paper\r\nwithout the support of any party, and even in the teeth of the\r\nopposition of those from whom he had reason to expect counsel and\r\nencouragement. He has been compelled, at one and the same time, and\r\nalmost constantly, during the past seven years, to contribute matter to\r\nits columns as editor, and to raise funds for its support as lecturer.\r\nIt is within bounds to say, that he has expended twelve thousand\r\ndollars of his own hard earned money, in publishing this paper, a\r\nlarger sum than has been contributed by any one individual for the\r\ngeneral advancement of the colored people. There had been many other\r\npapers published and edited by colored men, beginning as far back as\r\n1827, when the Rev. Samuel E. Cornish and John B. Russworm (a graduate\r\nof Bowdoin college, and afterward Governor of Cape Palmas) published\r\nthe _Freedom’s Journal_, in New York City; probably not less than one\r\nhundred newspaper enterprises have been started in the United States,\r\nby free colored men, born free, and some of them of liberal education\r\nand fair talents for this work; but, one after another, they have\r\nfallen through, although, in several instances, anti-slavery friends\r\ncontributed to their support. 3 It had almost been given up, as an\r\nimpracticable thing, to maintain a colored newspaper, when Mr.\r\nDouglass, with fewest early advantages of all his competitors, essayed,\r\nand has proved the thing perfectly practicable, and, moreover, of great\r\npublic benefit. This paper, in addition to its power in holding up the\r\nhands of those to whom it is especially devoted, also affords\r\nirrefutable evidence of the justice, safety and practicability of\r\nImmediate Emancipation; it further proves the immense loss which\r\nslavery inflicts on the land while it dooms such energies as his to the\r\nhereditary degradation of slavery.\r\n\r\nIt has been said in this Introduction, that Mr. Douglass had raised\r\nhimself by his own efforts to the highest position in society. As a\r\nsuccessful editor, in our land, he occupies this position. Our editors\r\nrule the land, and he is one of them. As an orator and thinker, his\r\nposition is equally high, in the opinion of his countrymen. If a\r\nstranger in the United States would seek its most distinguished men—the\r\nmovers of public opinion—he will find their names mentioned, and their\r\nmovements chronicled, under the head of “BY MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH,” in the\r\ndaily papers. The keen caterers for the public attention, set down, in\r\nthis column, such men only as have won high mark in the public esteem.\r\nDuring the past winter—1854-5—very frequent mention of Frederick\r\nDouglass was made under this head in the daily papers; his name glided\r\nas often—this week from Chicago, next week from Boston—over the\r\nlightning wires, as the name of any other man, of whatever note. To no\r\nman did the people more widely nor more earnestly say, _“Tell me thy\r\nthought!”_ And, somehow or other, revolution seemed to follow in his\r\nwake. His were not the mere words of eloquence which Kossuth speaks of,\r\nthat delight the ear and then pass away. No! They were _work_-able,\r\n_do_-able words, that brought forth fruits in the revolution in\r\nIllinois, and in the passage of the franchise resolutions by the\r\nAssembly of New York.\r\n\r\nAnd the secret of his power, what is it? He is a Representative\r\nAmerican man—a type of his countrymen. Naturalists tell us that a full\r\ngrown man is a resultant or representative of all animated nature on\r\nthis globe; beginning with the early embryo state, then representing\r\nthe lowest forms of organic life, 4 and passing through every\r\nsubordinate grade or type, until he reaches the last and\r\nhighest—manhood. In like manner, and to the fullest extent, has\r\nFrederick Douglass passed through every gradation of rank comprised in\r\nour national make-up, and bears upon his person and upon his soul every\r\nthing that is American. And he has not only full sympathy with every\r\nthing American; his proclivity or bent, to active toil and visible\r\nprogress, are in the strictly national direction, delighting to\r\noutstrip “all creation.”\r\n\r\nNor have the natural gifts, already named as his, lost anything by his\r\nsevere training. When unexcited, his mental processes are probably\r\nslow, but singularly clear in perception, and wide in vision, the\r\nunfailing memory bringing up all the facts in their every aspect;\r\nincongruities he lays hold of incontinently, and holds up on the edge\r\nof his keen and telling wit. But this wit never descends to frivolity;\r\nit is rigidly in the keeping of his truthful common sense, and always\r\nused in illustration or proof of some point which could not so readily\r\nbe reached any other way. “Beware of a Yankee when he is feeding,” is a\r\nshaft that strikes home in a matter never so laid bare by satire\r\nbefore. “The Garrisonian views of disunion, if carried to a successful\r\nissue, would only place the people of the north in the same relation to\r\nAmerican slavery which they now bear to the slavery of Cuba or the\r\nBrazils,” is a statement, in a few words, which contains the result and\r\nthe evidence of an argument which might cover pages, but could not\r\ncarry stronger conviction, nor be stated in less pregnable form. In\r\nproof of this, I may say, that having been submitted to the attention\r\nof the Garrisonians in print, in March, it was repeated before them at\r\ntheir business meeting in May—the platform, _par excellence_, on which\r\nthey invite free fight, _a l’outrance_, to all comers. It was given out\r\nin the clear, ringing tones, wherewith the hall of shields was wont to\r\nresound of old, yet neither Garrison, nor Phillips, nor May, nor\r\nRemond, nor Foster, nor Burleigh, with his subtle steel of “the ice\r\nbrook’s temper,” ventured to break a lance upon it! The doctrine of the\r\ndissolution of the Union, as a means for the abolition of American\r\nslavery, was silenced upon the lips that gave it birth, and in the\r\npresence of an array of defenders who compose the keenest intellects in\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n_“The man who is right is a majority”_ is an aphorism struck out by Mr.\r\nDouglass in that great gathering of the friends of freedom, at\r\nPittsburgh, in 1852, where he towered among the highest, because, with\r\nabilities inferior to none, and moved more deeply than any, there was\r\nneither policy nor party to trammel the outpourings of his soul. Thus\r\nwe find, opposed to all disadvantages which a black man in the United\r\nStates labors and struggles under, is this one vantage ground—when the\r\nchance comes, and the audience where he may have a say, he stands forth\r\nthe freest, most deeply moved and most earnest of all men.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of Mr. Douglass, that his descriptive and declamatory\r\npowers, admitted to be of the very highest order, take precedence of\r\nhis logical force. Whilst the schools might have trained him to the\r\nexhibition of the formulas of deductive logic, nature and circumstances\r\nforced him into the exercise of the higher faculties required by\r\ninduction. The first ninety pages of this “Life in Bondage,” afford\r\nspecimens of observing, comparing, and careful classifying, of such\r\nsuperior character, that it is difficult to believe them the results of\r\na child’s thinking; he questions the earth, and the children and the\r\nslaves around him again and again, and finally looks to _“God in the\r\nsky”_ for the why and the wherefore of the unnatural thing, slavery.\r\n_“Yes, if indeed thou art, wherefore dost thou suffer us to be slain?”_\r\nis the only prayer and worship of the God-forsaken Dodos in the heart\r\nof Africa. Almost the same was his prayer. One of his earliest\r\nobservations was that white children should know their ages, while the\r\ncolored children were ignorant of theirs; and the songs of the slaves\r\ngrated on his inmost soul, because a something told him that harmony in\r\nsound, and music of the spirit, could not consociate with miserable\r\ndegradation.\r\n\r\nTo such a mind, the ordinary processes of logical deduction are like\r\nproving that two and two make four. Mastering the intermediate steps by\r\nan intuitive glance, or recurring to them as Ferguson resorted to\r\ngeometry, it goes down to the deeper relation of things, and brings out\r\nwhat may seem, to some, mere statements, but which are new and\r\nbrilliant generalizations, each resting on a broad and stable basis.\r\nThus, Chief Justice Marshall gave his decisions, and then told Brother\r\nStory to look up the authorities—and they never differed from him.\r\nThus, also, in his “Lecture on the Anti-Slavery Movement,” delivered\r\nbefore the Rochester Ladies’ Anti-Slavery Society, Mr. Douglass\r\npresents a mass of thought, which, without any showy display of logic\r\non his part, requires an exercise of the reasoning faculties of the\r\nreader to keep pace with him. And his “Claims of the Negro\r\nEthnologically Considered,” is full of new and fresh thoughts on the\r\ndawning science of race-history.\r\n\r\nIf, as has been stated, his intellection is slow, when unexcited, it is\r\nmost prompt and rapid when he is thoroughly aroused. Memory, logic,\r\nwit, sarcasm, invective pathos and bold imagery of rare structural\r\nbeauty, well up as from a copious fountain, yet each in its proper\r\nplace, and contributing to form a whole, grand in itself, yet complete\r\nin the minutest proportions. It is most difficult to hedge him in a\r\ncorner, for his positions are taken so deliberately, that it is rare to\r\nfind a point in them undefended aforethought. Professor Reason tells me\r\nthe following: “On a recent visit of a public nature, to Philadelphia,\r\nand in a meeting composed mostly of his colored brethren, Mr. Douglass\r\nproposed a comparison of views in the matters of the relations and\r\nduties of ‘our people;’ he holding that prejudice was the result of\r\ncondition, and could be conquered by the efforts of the degraded\r\nthemselves. A gentleman present, distinguished for logical acumen and\r\nsubtlety, and who had devoted no small portion of the last twenty-five\r\nyears to the study and elucidation of this very question, held the\r\nopposite view, that prejudice is innate and unconquerable. He\r\nterminated a series of well dove-tailed, Socratic questions to Mr.\r\nDouglass, with the following: ‘If the legislature at Harrisburgh should\r\nawaken, to-morrow morning, and find each man’s skin turned black and\r\nhis hair woolly, what could they do to remove prejudice?’ ‘Immediately\r\npass laws entitling black men to all civil, political and social\r\nprivileges,’ was the instant reply—and the questioning ceased.”\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable mental phenomenon in Mr. Douglass, is his style in\r\nwriting and speaking. In March, 1855, he delivered an address in the\r\nassembly chamber before the members of the legislature of the state of\r\nNew York. An eye witness 5 describes the crowded and most intelligent\r\naudience, and their rapt attention to the speaker, as the grandest\r\nscene he ever witnessed in the capitol. Among those whose eyes were\r\nriveted on the speaker full two hours and a half, were Thurlow Weed and\r\nLieutenant Governor Raymond; the latter, at the conclusion of the\r\naddress, exclaimed to a friend, “I would give twenty thousand dollars,\r\nif I could deliver that address in that manner.” Mr. Raymond is a first\r\nclass graduate of Dartmouth, a rising politician, ranking foremost in\r\nthe legislature; of course, his ideal of oratory must be of the most\r\npolished and finished description.\r\n\r\nThe style of Mr. Douglass in writing, is to me an intellectual puzzle.\r\nThe strength, affluence and terseness may easily be accounted for,\r\nbecause the style of a man is the man; but how are we to account for\r\nthat rare polish in his style of writing, which, most critically\r\nexamined, seems the result of careful early culture among the best\r\nclassics of our language; it equals if it does not surpass the style of\r\nHugh Miller, which was the wonder of the British literary public, until\r\nhe unraveled the mystery in the most interesting of autobiographies.\r\nBut Frederick Douglass was still calking the seams of Baltimore\r\nclippers, and had only written a “pass,” at the age when Miller’s style\r\nwas already formed.\r\n\r\nI asked William Whipper, of Pennsylvania, the gentleman alluded to\r\nabove, whether he thought Mr. Douglass’s power inherited from the\r\nNegroid, or from what is called the Caucasian side of his make up?\r\nAfter some reflection, he frankly answered, “I must admit, although\r\nsorry to do so, that the Caucasian predominates.” At that time, I\r\nalmost agreed with him; but, facts narrated in the first part of this\r\nwork, throw a different light on this interesting question.\r\n\r\nWe are left in the dark as to who was the paternal ancestor of our\r\nauthor; a fact which generally holds good of the Romuluses and Remuses\r\nwho are to inaugurate the new birth of our republic. In the absence of\r\ntestimony from the Caucasian side, we must see what evidence is given\r\non the other side of the house.\r\n\r\n“My grandmother, though advanced in years, * * * was yet a woman of\r\npower and spirit. She was marvelously straight in figure, elastic and\r\nmuscular.” (p. 46.)\r\n\r\nAfter describing her skill in constructing nets, her perseverance in\r\nusing them, and her wide-spread fame in the agricultural way he adds,\r\n“It happened to her—as it will happen to any careful and thrifty person\r\nresiding in an ignorant and improvident neighborhood—to enjoy the\r\nreputation of being born to good luck.” And his grandmother was a black\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n“My mother was tall, and finely proportioned; of deep black, glossy\r\ncomplexion; had regular features; and among other slaves was remarkably\r\nsedate in her manners.” “Being a field hand, she was obliged to walk\r\ntwelve miles and return, between nightfall and daybreak, to see her\r\nchildren” (p. 54.) “I shall never forget the indescribable expression\r\nof her countenance when I told her that I had had no food since\r\nmorning. * * * There was pity in her glance at me, and a fiery\r\nindignation at Aunt Katy at the same time; * * * * she read Aunt Katy a\r\nlecture which she never forgot.” (p. 56.) “I learned after my mother’s\r\ndeath, that she could read, and that she was the _only_ one of all the\r\nslaves and colored people in Tuckahoe who enjoyed that advantage. How\r\nshe acquired this knowledge, I know not, for Tuckahoe is the last place\r\nin the world where she would be apt to find facilities for learning.”\r\n(p. 57.) “There is, in _Prichard’s Natural History of Man_, the head of\r\na figure—on page 157—the features of which so resemble those of my\r\nmother, that I often recur to it with something of the feeling which I\r\nsuppose others experience when looking upon the pictures of dear\r\ndeparted ones.” (p. 52.)\r\n\r\nThe head alluded to is copied from the statue of Ramses the Great, an\r\nEgyptian king of the nineteenth dynasty. The authors of the _Types of\r\nMankind_ give a side view of the same on page 148, remarking that the\r\nprofile, “like Napoleon’s, is superbly European!” The nearness of its\r\nresemblance to Mr. Douglass’ mother rests upon the evidence of his\r\nmemory, and judging from his almost marvelous feats of recollection of\r\nforms and outlines recorded in this book, this testimony may be\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nThese facts show that for his energy, perseverance, eloquence,\r\ninvective, sagacity, and wide sympathy, he is indebted to his Negro\r\nblood. The very marvel of his style would seem to be a development of\r\nthat other marvel—how his mother learned to read. The versatility of\r\ntalent which he wields, in common with Dumas, Ira Aldridge, and Miss\r\nGreenfield, would seem to be the result of the grafting of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon on good, original, Negro stock. If the friends of\r\n“Caucasus” choose to claim, for that region, what remains after this\r\nanalysis—to wit: combination—they are welcome to it. They will forgive\r\nme for reminding them that the term “Caucasian” is dropped by recent\r\nwriters on Ethnology; for the people about Mount Caucasus, are, and\r\nhave ever been, Mongols. The great “white race” now seek paternity,\r\naccording to Dr. Pickering, in Arabia—“Arida Nutrix” of the best breed\r\nof horses &c. Keep on, gentlemen; you will find yourselves in Africa,\r\nby-and-by. The Egyptians, like the Americans, were a _mixed race_, with\r\nsome Negro blood circling around the throne, as well as in the mud\r\nhovels.\r\n\r\nThis is the proper place to remark of our author, that the same strong\r\nself-hood, which led him to measure strength with Mr. Covey, and to\r\nwrench himself from the embrace of the Garrisonians, and which has\r\nborne him through many resistances to the personal indignities offered\r\nhim as a colored man, sometimes becomes a hyper-sensitiveness to such\r\nassaults as men of his mark will meet with, on paper. Keen and\r\nunscrupulous opponents have sought, and not unsuccessfully, to pierce\r\nhim in this direction; for well they know, that if assailed, he will\r\nsmite back.\r\n\r\nIt is not without a feeling of pride, dear reader, that I present you\r\nwith this book. The son of a self-emancipated bond-woman, I feel joy in\r\nintroducing to you my brother, who has rent his own bonds, and who, in\r\nhis every relation—as a public man, as a husband and as a father—is\r\nsuch as does honor to the land which gave him birth. I shall place this\r\nbook in the hands of the only child spared me, bidding him to strive\r\nand emulate its noble example. You may do likewise. It is an American\r\nbook, for Americans, in the fullest sense of the idea. It shows that\r\nthe worst of our institutions, in its worst aspect, cannot keep down\r\nenergy, truthfulness, and earnest struggle for the right. It proves the\r\njustice and practicability of Immediate Emancipation. It shows that any\r\nman in our land, “no matter in what battle his liberty may have been\r\ncloven down, * * * * no matter what complexion an Indian or an African\r\nsun may have burned upon him,” not only may “stand forth redeemed and\r\ndisenthralled,” but may also stand up a candidate for the highest\r\nsuffrage of a great people—the tribute of their honest, hearty\r\nadmiration. Reader, _Vale! New York_\r\n\r\nJAMES M’CUNE SMITH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. _Childhood_\r\n\r\n\r\nPLACE OF BIRTH—CHARACTER OF THE DISTRICT—TUCKAHOE—ORIGIN OF THE\r\nNAME—CHOPTANK RIVER—TIME OF BIRTH—GENEALOGICAL TREES—MODE OF COUNTING\r\nTIME—NAMES OF GRANDPARENTS—THEIR POSITION—GRANDMOTHER ESPECIALLY\r\nESTEEMED—“BORN TO GOOD LUCK”—SWEET POTATOES—SUPERSTITION—THE LOG\r\nCABIN—ITS CHARMS—SEPARATING CHILDREN—MY AUNTS—THEIR NAMES—FIRST\r\nKNOWLEDGE OF BEING A SLAVE—OLD MASTER—GRIEFS AND JOYS OF\r\nCHILDHOOD—COMPARATIVE HAPPINESS OF THE SLAVE-BOY AND THE SON OF A\r\nSLAVEHOLDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Talbot county, Eastern Shore, Maryland, near Easton, the county town\r\nof that county, there is a small district of country, thinly populated,\r\nand remarkable for nothing that I know of more than for the worn-out,\r\nsandy, desert-like appearance of its soil, the general dilapidation of\r\nits farms and fences, the indigent and spiritless character of its\r\ninhabitants, and the prevalence of ague and fever.\r\n\r\nThe name of this singularly unpromising and truly famine stricken\r\ndistrict is Tuckahoe, a name well known to all Marylanders, black and\r\nwhite. It was given to this section of country probably, at the first,\r\nmerely in derision; or it may possibly have been applied to it, as I\r\nhave heard, because some one of its earlier inhabitants had been guilty\r\nof the petty meanness of stealing a hoe—or taking a hoe that did not\r\nbelong to him. Eastern Shore men usually pronounce the word _took_, as\r\n_tuck; Took-a-hoe_, therefore, is, in Maryland parlance, _Tuckahoe_.\r\nBut, whatever may have been its origin—and about this I will not be\r\npositive—that name has stuck to the district in question; and it is\r\nseldom mentioned but with contempt and derision, on account of the\r\nbarrenness of its soil, and the ignorance, indolence, and poverty of\r\nits people. Decay and ruin are everywhere visible, and the thin\r\npopulation of the place would have quitted it long ago, but for the\r\nChoptank river, which runs through it, from which they take abundance\r\nof shad and herring, and plenty of ague and fever.\r\n\r\nIt was in this dull, flat, and unthrifty district, or neighborhood,\r\nsurrounded by a white population of the lowest order, indolent and\r\ndrunken to a proverb, and among slaves, who seemed to ask, _“Oh! what’s\r\nthe use?”_ every time they lifted a hoe, that I—without any fault of\r\nmine was born, and spent the first years of my childhood.\r\n\r\nThe reader will pardon so much about the place of my birth, on the\r\nscore that it is always a fact of some importance to know where a man\r\nis born, if, indeed, it be important to know anything about him. In\r\nregard to the _time_ of my birth, I cannot be as definite as I have\r\nbeen respecting the _place_. Nor, indeed, can I impart much knowledge\r\nconcerning my parents. Genealogical trees do not flourish among slaves.\r\nA person of some consequence here in the north, sometimes designated\r\n_father_, is literally abolished in slave law and slave practice. It is\r\nonly once in a while that an exception is found to this statement. I\r\nnever met with a slave who could tell me how old he was. Few\r\nslave-mothers know anything of the months of the year, nor of the days\r\nof the month. They keep no family records, with marriages, births, and\r\ndeaths. They measure the ages of their children by spring time, winter\r\ntime, harvest time, planting time, and the like; but these soon become\r\nundistinguishable and forgotten. Like other slaves, I cannot tell how\r\nold I am. This destitution was among my earliest troubles. I learned\r\nwhen I grew up, that my master—and this is the case with masters\r\ngenerally—allowed no questions to be put to him, by which a slave might\r\nlearn his age. Such questions deemed evidence of impatience, and even\r\nof impudent curiosity. From certain events, however, the dates of which\r\nI have since learned, I suppose myself to have been born about the year\r\n1817.\r\n\r\nThe first experience of life with me that I now remember—and I remember\r\nit but hazily—began in the family of my grandmother and grandfather.\r\nBetsey and Isaac Baily. They were quite advanced in life, and had long\r\nlived on the spot where they then resided. They were considered old\r\nsettlers in the neighborhood, and, from certain circumstances, I infer\r\nthat my grandmother, especially, was held in high esteem, far higher\r\nthan is the lot of most colored persons in the slave states. She was a\r\ngood nurse, and a capital hand at making nets for catching shad and\r\nherring; and these nets were in great demand, not only in Tuckahoe, but\r\nat Denton and Hillsboro, neighboring villages. She was not only good at\r\nmaking the nets, but was also somewhat famous for her good fortune in\r\ntaking the fishes referred to. I have known her to be in the water half\r\nthe day. Grandmother was likewise more provident than most of her\r\nneighbors in the preservation of seedling sweet potatoes, and it\r\nhappened to her—as it will happen to any careful and thrifty person\r\nresiding in an ignorant and improvident community—to enjoy the\r\nreputation of having been born to “good luck.” Her “good luck” was\r\nowing to the exceeding care which she took in preventing the succulent\r\nroot from getting bruised in the digging, and in placing it beyond the\r\nreach of frost, by actually burying it under the hearth of her cabin\r\nduring the winter months. In the time of planting sweet potatoes,\r\n“Grandmother Betty,” as she was familiarly called, was sent for in all\r\ndirections, simply to place the seedling potatoes in the hills; for\r\nsuperstition had it, that if “Grandmamma Betty but touches them at\r\nplanting, they will be sure to grow and flourish.” This high reputation\r\nwas full of advantage to her, and to the children around her. Though\r\nTuckahoe had but few of the good things of life, yet of such as it did\r\npossess grandmother got a full share, in the way of presents. If good\r\npotato crops came after her planting, she was not forgotten by those\r\nfor whom she planted; and as she was remembered by others, so she\r\nremembered the hungry little ones around her.\r\n\r\nThe dwelling of my grandmother and grandfather had few pretensions. It\r\nwas a log hut, or cabin, built of clay, wood, and straw. At a distance\r\nit resembled—though it was smaller, less commodious and less\r\nsubstantial—the cabins erected in the western states by the first\r\nsettlers. To my child’s eye, however, it was a noble structure,\r\nadmirably adapted to promote the comforts and conveniences of its\r\ninmates. A few rough, Virginia fence-rails, flung loosely over the\r\nrafters above, answered the triple purpose of floors, ceilings, and\r\nbedsteads. To be sure, this upper apartment was reached only by a\r\nladder—but what in the world for climbing could be better than a\r\nladder? To me, this ladder was really a high invention, and possessed a\r\nsort of charm as I played with delight upon the rounds of it. In this\r\nlittle hut there was a large family of children: I dare not say how\r\nmany. My grandmother—whether because too old for field service, or\r\nbecause she had so faithfully discharged the duties of her station in\r\nearly life, I know not—enjoyed the high privilege of living in a cabin,\r\nseparate from the quarter, with no other burden than her own support,\r\nand the necessary care of the little children, imposed. She evidently\r\nesteemed it a great fortune to live so. The children were not her own,\r\nbut her grandchildren—the children of her daughters. She took delight\r\nin having them around her, and in attending to their few wants. The\r\npractice of separating children from their mother, and hiring the\r\nlatter out at distances too great to admit of their meeting, except at\r\nlong intervals, is a marked feature of the cruelty and barbarity of the\r\nslave system. But it is in harmony with the grand aim of slavery,\r\nwhich, always and everywhere, is to reduce man to a level with the\r\nbrute. It is a successful method of obliterating from the mind and\r\nheart of the slave, all just ideas of the sacredness of _the family_,\r\nas an institution.\r\n\r\nMost of the children, however, in this instance, being the children of\r\nmy grandmother’s daughters, the notions of family, and the reciprocal\r\nduties and benefits of the relation, had a better chance of being\r\nunderstood than where children are placed—as they often are in the\r\nhands of strangers, who have no care for them, apart from the wishes of\r\ntheir masters. The daughters of my grandmother were five in number.\r\nTheir names were JENNY, ESTHER, MILLY, PRISCILLA, and HARRIET. The\r\ndaughter last named was my mother, of whom the reader shall learn more\r\nby-and-by.\r\n\r\nLiving here, with my dear old grandmother and grandfather, it was a\r\nlong time before I knew myself to be _a slave_. I knew many other\r\nthings before I knew that. Grandmother and grandfather were the\r\ngreatest people in the world to me; and being with them so snugly in\r\ntheir own little cabin—I supposed it be their own—knowing no higher\r\nauthority over me or the other children than the authority of\r\ngrandmamma, for a time there was nothing to disturb me; but, as I grew\r\nlarger and older, I learned by degrees the sad fact, that the “little\r\nhut,” and the lot on which it stood, belonged not to my dear old\r\ngrandparents, but to some person who lived a great distance off, and\r\nwho was called, by grandmother, “OLD MASTER.” I further learned the\r\nsadder fact, that not only the house and lot, but that grandmother\r\nherself, (grandfather was free,) and all the little children around\r\nher, belonged to this mysterious personage, called by grandmother, with\r\nevery mark of reverence, “Old Master.” Thus early did clouds and\r\nshadows begin to fall upon my path. Once on the track—troubles never\r\ncome singly—I was not long in finding out another fact, still more\r\ngrievous to my childish heart. I was told that this “old master,” whose\r\nname seemed ever to be mentioned with fear and shuddering, only allowed\r\nthe children to live with grandmother for a limited time, and that in\r\nfact as soon as they were big enough, they were promptly taken away, to\r\nlive with the said “old master.” These were distressing revelations\r\nindeed; and though I was quite too young to comprehend the full import\r\nof the intelligence, and mostly spent my childhood days in gleesome\r\nsports with the other children, a shade of disquiet rested upon me.\r\n\r\nThe absolute power of this distant “old master” had touched my young\r\nspirit with but the point of its cold, cruel iron, and left me\r\nsomething to brood over after the play and in moments of repose.\r\nGrandmammy was, indeed, at that time, all the world to me; and the\r\nthought of being separated from her, in any considerable time, was more\r\nthan an unwelcome intruder. It was intolerable.\r\n\r\nChildren have their sorrows as well as men and women; and it would be\r\nwell to remember this in our dealings with them. SLAVE-children _are_\r\nchildren, and prove no exceptions to the general rule. The liability to\r\nbe separated from my grandmother, seldom or never to see her again,\r\nhaunted me. I dreaded the thought of going to live with that mysterious\r\n“old master,” whose name I never heard mentioned with affection, but\r\nalways with fear. I look back to this as among the heaviest of my\r\nchildhood’s sorrows. My grandmother! my grandmother! and the little\r\nhut, and the joyous circle under her care, but especially _she_, who\r\nmade us sorry when she left us but for an hour, and glad on her\r\nreturn,—how could I leave her and the good old home?\r\n\r\nBut the sorrows of childhood, like the pleasures of after life, are\r\ntransient. It is not even within the power of slavery to write\r\n_indelible_ sorrow, at a single dash, over the heart of a child.\r\n\r\nThe tear down childhood’s cheek that flows,\r\nIs like the dew-drop on the rose—\r\nWhen next the summer breeze comes by,\r\nAnd waves the bush—the flower is dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is, after all, but little difference in the measure of\r\ncontentment felt by the slave-child neglected and the slaveholder’s\r\nchild cared for and petted. The spirit of the All Just mercifully holds\r\nthe balance for the young.\r\n\r\nThe slaveholder, having nothing to fear from impotent childhood, easily\r\naffords to refrain from cruel inflictions; and if cold and hunger do\r\nnot pierce the tender frame, the first seven or eight years of the\r\nslave-boy’s life are about as full of sweet content as those of the\r\nmost favored and petted _white_ children of the slaveholder. The\r\nslave-boy escapes many troubles which befall and vex his white brother.\r\nHe seldom has to listen to lectures on propriety of behavior, or on\r\nanything else. He is never chided for handling his little knife and\r\nfork improperly or awkwardly, for he uses none. He is never reprimanded\r\nfor soiling the table-cloth, for he takes his meals on the clay floor.\r\nHe never has the misfortune, in his games or sports, of soiling or\r\ntearing his clothes, for he has almost none to soil or tear. He is\r\nnever expected to act like a nice little gentleman, for he is only a\r\nrude little slave. Thus, freed from all restraint, the slave-boy can\r\nbe, in his life and conduct, a genuine boy, doing whatever his boyish\r\nnature suggests; enacting, by turns, all the strange antics and freaks\r\nof horses, dogs, pigs, and barn-door fowls, without in any manner\r\ncompromising his dignity, or incurring reproach of any sort. He\r\nliterally runs wild; has no pretty little verses to learn in the\r\nnursery; no nice little speeches to make for aunts, uncles, or cousins,\r\nto show how smart he is; and, if he can only manage to keep out of the\r\nway of the heavy feet and fists of the older slave boys, he may trot\r\non, in his joyous and roguish tricks, as happy as any little heathen\r\nunder the palm trees of Africa. To be sure, he is occasionally\r\nreminded, when he stumbles in the path of his master—and this he early\r\nlearns to avoid—that he is eating his _“white bread,”_ and that he will\r\nbe made to _“see sights”_ by-and-by. The threat is soon forgotten; the\r\nshadow soon passes, and our sable boy continues to roll in the dust, or\r\nplay in the mud, as bests suits him, and in the veriest freedom. If he\r\nfeels uncomfortable, from mud or from dust, the coast is clear; he can\r\nplunge into the river or the pond, without the ceremony of undressing,\r\nor the fear of wetting his clothes; his little tow-linen shirt—for that\r\nis all he has on—is easily dried; and it needed ablution as much as did\r\nhis skin. His food is of the coarsest kind, consisting for the most\r\npart of cornmeal mush, which often finds it way from the wooden tray to\r\nhis mouth in an oyster shell. His days, when the weather is warm, are\r\nspent in the pure, open air, and in the bright sunshine. He always\r\nsleeps in airy apartments; he seldom has to take powders, or to be paid\r\nto swallow pretty little sugar-coated pills, to cleanse his blood, or\r\nto quicken his appetite. He eats no candies; gets no lumps of loaf\r\nsugar; always relishes his food; cries but little, for nobody cares for\r\nhis crying; learns to esteem his bruises but slight, because others so\r\nesteem them. In a word, he is, for the most part of the first eight\r\nyears of his life, a spirited, joyous, uproarious, and happy boy, upon\r\nwhom troubles fall only like water on a duck’s back. And such a boy, so\r\nfar as I can now remember, was the boy whose life in slavery I am now\r\nnarrating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. _Removed from My First Home_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAME “OLD MASTER” A TERROR—COLONEL LLOYD’S PLANTATION—WYE\r\nRIVER—WHENCE ITS NAME—POSITION OF THE LLOYDS—HOME ATTRACTION—MEET\r\nOFFERING—JOURNEY FROM TUCKAHOE TO WYE RIVER—SCENE ON REACHING OLD\r\nMASTER’S—DEPARTURE OF GRANDMOTHER—STRANGE MEETING OF SISTERS AND\r\nBROTHERS—REFUSAL TO BE COMFORTED—SWEET SLEEP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat mysterious individual referred to in the first chapter as an\r\nobject of terror among the inhabitants of our little cabin, under the\r\nominous title of “old master,” was really a man of some consequence. He\r\nowned several farms in Tuckahoe; was the chief clerk and butler on the\r\nhome plantation of Col. Edward Lloyd; had overseers on his own farms;\r\nand gave directions to overseers on the farms belonging to Col. Lloyd.\r\nThis plantation is situated on Wye river—the river receiving its name,\r\ndoubtless, from Wales, where the Lloyds originated. They (the Lloyds)\r\nare an old and honored family in Maryland, exceedingly wealthy. The\r\nhome plantation, where they have resided, perhaps for a century or\r\nmore, is one of the largest, most fertile, and best appointed, in the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nAbout this plantation, and about that queer old master—who must be\r\nsomething more than a man, and something worse than an angel—the reader\r\nwill easily imagine that I was not only curious, but eager, to know all\r\nthat could be known. Unhappily for me, however, all the information I\r\ncould get concerning him increased my great dread of being carried\r\nthither—of being separated from and deprived of the protection of my\r\ngrandmother and grandfather. It was, evidently, a great thing to go to\r\nCol. Lloyd’s; and I was not without a little curiosity to see the\r\nplace; but no amount of coaxing could induce in me the wish to remain\r\nthere. The fact is, such was my dread of leaving the little cabin, that\r\nI wished to remain little forever, for I knew the taller I grew the\r\nshorter my stay. The old cabin, with its rail floor and rail bedsteads\r\nupstairs, and its clay floor downstairs, and its dirt chimney, and\r\nwindowless sides, and that most curious piece of workmanship dug in\r\nfront of the fireplace, beneath which grandmammy placed the sweet\r\npotatoes to keep them from the frost, was MY HOME—the only home I ever\r\nhad; and I loved it, and all connected with it. The old fences around\r\nit, and the stumps in the edge of the woods near it, and the squirrels\r\nthat ran, skipped, and played upon them, were objects of interest and\r\naffection. There, too, right at the side of the hut, stood the old\r\nwell, with its stately and skyward-pointing beam, so aptly placed\r\nbetween the limbs of what had once been a tree, and so nicely balanced\r\nthat I could move it up and down with only one hand, and could get a\r\ndrink myself without calling for help. Where else in the world could\r\nsuch a well be found, and where could such another home be met with?\r\nNor were these all the attractions of the place. Down in a little\r\nvalley, not far from grandmammy’s cabin, stood Mr. Lee’s mill, where\r\nthe people came often in large numbers to get their corn ground. It was\r\na watermill; and I never shall be able to tell the many things thought\r\nand felt, while I sat on the bank and watched that mill, and the\r\nturning of that ponderous wheel. The mill-pond, too, had its charms;\r\nand with my pinhook, and thread line, I could get _nibbles_, if I could\r\ncatch no fish. But, in all my sports and plays, and in spite of them,\r\nthere would, occasionally, come the painful foreboding that I was not\r\nlong to remain there, and that I must soon be called away to the home\r\nof old master.\r\n\r\nI was A SLAVE—born a slave and though the fact was incomprehensible to\r\nme, it conveyed to my mind a sense of my entire dependence on the will\r\nof _somebody_ I had never seen; and, from some cause or other, I had\r\nbeen made to fear this somebody above all else on earth. Born for\r\nanother’s benefit, as the _firstling_ of the cabin flock I was soon to\r\nbe selected as a meet offering to the fearful and inexorable _demigod_,\r\nwhose huge image on so many occasions haunted my childhood’s\r\nimagination. When the time of my departure was decided upon, my\r\ngrandmother, knowing my fears, and in pity for them, kindly kept me\r\nignorant of the dreaded event about to transpire. Up to the morning (a\r\nbeautiful summer morning) when we were to start, and, indeed, during\r\nthe whole journey—a journey which, child as I was, I remember as well\r\nas if it were yesterday—she kept the sad fact hidden from me. This\r\nreserve was necessary; for, could I have known all, I should have given\r\ngrandmother some trouble in getting me started. As it was, I was\r\nhelpless, and she—dear woman!—led me along by the hand, resisting, with\r\nthe reserve and solemnity of a priestess, all my inquiring looks to the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Tuckahoe to Wye river—where my old master lived—was\r\nfull twelve miles, and the walk was quite a severe test of the\r\nendurance of my young legs. The journey would have proved too severe\r\nfor me, but that my dear old grandmother—blessings on her\r\nmemory!—afforded occasional relief by “toting” me (as Marylanders have\r\nit) on her shoulder. My grandmother, though advanced in years—as was\r\nevident from more than one gray hair, which peeped from between the\r\nample and graceful folds of her newly-ironed bandana turban—was yet a\r\nwoman of power and spirit. She was marvelously straight in figure,\r\nelastic, and muscular. I seemed hardly to be a burden to her. She would\r\nhave “toted” me farther, but that I felt myself too much of a man to\r\nallow it, and insisted on walking. Releasing dear grandmamma from\r\ncarrying me, did not make me altogether independent of her, when we\r\nhappened to pass through portions of the somber woods which lay between\r\nTuckahoe and Wye river. She often found me increasing the energy of my\r\ngrip, and holding her clothing, lest something should come out of the\r\nwoods and eat me up. Several old logs and stumps imposed upon me, and\r\ngot themselves taken for wild beasts. I could see their legs, eyes, and\r\nears, or I could see something like eyes, legs, and ears, till I got\r\nclose enough to them to see that the eyes were knots, washed white with\r\nrain, and the legs were broken limbs, and the ears, only ears owing to\r\nthe point from which they were seen. Thus early I learned that the\r\npoint from which a thing is viewed is of some importance.\r\n\r\nAs the day advanced the heat increased; and it was not until the\r\nafternoon that we reached the much dreaded end of the journey. I found\r\nmyself in the midst of a group of children of many colors; black,\r\nbrown, copper colored, and nearly white. I had not seen so many\r\nchildren before. Great houses loomed up in different directions, and a\r\ngreat many men and women were at work in the fields. All this hurry,\r\nnoise, and singing was very different from the stillness of Tuckahoe.\r\nAs a new comer, I was an object of special interest; and, after\r\nlaughing and yelling around me, and playing all sorts of wild tricks,\r\nthey (the children) asked me to go out and play with them. This I\r\nrefused to do, preferring to stay with grandmamma. I could not help\r\nfeeling that our being there boded no good to me. Grandmamma looked\r\nsad. She was soon to lose another object of affection, as she had lost\r\nmany before. I knew she was unhappy, and the shadow fell from her brow\r\non me, though I knew not the cause.\r\n\r\nAll suspense, however, must have an end; and the end of mine, in this\r\ninstance, was at hand. Affectionately patting me on the head, and\r\nexhorting me to be a good boy, grandmamma told me to go and play with\r\nthe little children. “They are kin to you,” said she; “go and play with\r\nthem.” Among a number of cousins were Phil, Tom, Steve, and Jerry,\r\nNance and Betty.\r\n\r\nGrandmother pointed out my brother PERRY, my sister SARAH, and my\r\nsister ELIZA, who stood in the group. I had never seen my brother nor\r\nmy sisters before; and, though I had sometimes heard of them, and felt\r\na curious interest in them, I really did not understand what they were\r\nto me, or I to them. We were brothers and sisters, but what of that?\r\nWhy should they be attached to me, or I to them? Brothers and sisters\r\nwe were by blood; but _slavery_ had made us strangers. I heard the\r\nwords brother and sisters, and knew they must mean something; but\r\nslavery had robbed these terms of their true meaning. The experience\r\nthrough which I was passing, they had passed through before. They had\r\nalready been initiated into the mysteries of old master’s domicile, and\r\nthey seemed to look upon me with a certain degree of compassion; but my\r\nheart clave to my grandmother. Think it not strange, dear reader, that\r\nso little sympathy of feeling existed between us. The conditions of\r\nbrotherly and sisterly feeling were wanting—we had never nestled and\r\nplayed together. My poor mother, like many other slave-women, had many\r\n_children_, but NO FAMILY! The domestic hearth, with its holy lessons\r\nand precious endearments, is abolished in the case of a slave-mother\r\nand her children. “Little children, love one another,” are words seldom\r\nheard in a slave cabin.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to play with my brother and sisters, but they were\r\nstrangers to me, and I was full of fear that grandmother might leave\r\nwithout taking me with her. Entreated to do so, however, and that, too,\r\nby my dear grandmother, I went to the back part of the house, to play\r\nwith them and the other children. _Play_, however, I did not, but stood\r\nwith my back against the wall, witnessing the playing of the others. At\r\nlast, while standing there, one of the children, who had been in the\r\nkitchen, ran up to me, in a sort of roguish glee, exclaiming, “Fed,\r\nFed! grandmammy gone! grandmammy gone!” I could not believe it; yet,\r\nfearing the worst, I ran into the kitchen, to see for myself, and found\r\nit even so. Grandmammy had indeed gone, and was now far away, “clean”\r\nout of sight. I need not tell all that happened now. Almost\r\nheart-broken at the discovery, I fell upon the ground, and wept a boy’s\r\nbitter tears, refusing to be comforted. My brother and sisters came\r\naround me, and said, “Don’t cry,” and gave me peaches and pears, but I\r\nflung them away, and refused all their kindly advances. I had never\r\nbeen deceived before; and I felt not only grieved at parting—as I\r\nsupposed forever—with my grandmother, but indignant that a trick had\r\nbeen played upon me in a matter so serious.\r\n\r\nIt was now late in the afternoon. The day had been an exciting and\r\nwearisome one, and I knew not how or where, but I suppose I sobbed\r\nmyself to sleep. There is a healing in the angel wing of sleep, even\r\nfor the slave-boy; and its balm was never more welcome to any wounded\r\nsoul than it was to mine, the first night I spent at the domicile of\r\nold master. The reader may be surprised that I narrate so minutely an\r\nincident apparently so trivial, and which must have occurred when I was\r\nnot more than seven years old; but as I wish to give a faithful history\r\nof my experience in slavery, I cannot withhold a circumstance which, at\r\nthe time, affected me so deeply. Besides, this was, in fact, my first\r\nintroduction to the realities of slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. _Parentage_\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FATHER SHROUDED IN MYSTERY—MY MOTHER—HER PERSONAL\r\nAPPEARANCE—INTERFERENCE OF SLAVERY WITH THE NATURAL AFFECTIONS OF\r\nMOTHER AND CHILDREN—SITUATION OF MY MOTHER—HER NIGHTLY VISITS TO HER\r\nBOY—STRIKING INCIDENT—HER DEATH—HER PLACE OF BURIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the reader will now be kind enough to allow me time to grow bigger,\r\nand afford me an opportunity for my experience to become greater, I\r\nwill tell him something, by-and-by, of slave life, as I saw, felt, and\r\nheard it, on Col. Edward Lloyd’s plantation, and at the house of old\r\nmaster, where I had now, despite of myself, most suddenly, but not\r\nunexpectedly, been dropped. Meanwhile, I will redeem my promise to say\r\nsomething more of my dear mother.\r\n\r\nI say nothing of _father_, for he is shrouded in a mystery I have never\r\nbeen able to penetrate. Slavery does away with fathers, as it does away\r\nwith families. Slavery has no use for either fathers or families, and\r\nits laws do not recognize their existence in the social arrangements of\r\nthe plantation. When they _do_ exist, they are not the outgrowths of\r\nslavery, but are antagonistic to that system. The order of civilization\r\nis reversed here. The name of the child is not expected to be that of\r\nits father, and his condition does not necessarily affect that of the\r\nchild. He may be the slave of Mr. Tilgman; and his child, when born,\r\nmay be the slave of Mr. Gross. He may be a _freeman;_ and yet his child\r\nmay be a _chattel_. He may be white, glorying in the purity of his\r\nAnglo-Saxon blood; and his child may be ranked with the blackest\r\nslaves. Indeed, he _may_ be, and often _is_, master and father to the\r\nsame child. He can be father without being a husband, and may sell his\r\nchild without incurring reproach, if the child be by a woman in whose\r\nveins courses one thirty-second part of African blood. My father was a\r\nwhite man, or nearly white. It was sometimes whispered that my master\r\nwas my father.\r\n\r\nBut to return, or rather, to begin. My knowledge of my mother is very\r\nscanty, but very distinct. Her personal appearance and bearing are\r\nineffaceably stamped upon my memory. She was tall, and finely\r\nproportioned; of deep black, glossy complexion; had regular features,\r\nand, among the other slaves, was remarkably sedate in her manners.\r\nThere is in _Prichard’s Natural History of Man_, the head of a\r\nfigure—on page 157—the features of which so resemble those of my\r\nmother, that I often recur to it with something of the feeling which I\r\nsuppose others experience when looking upon the pictures of dear\r\ndeparted ones.\r\n\r\nYet I cannot say that I was very deeply attached to my mother;\r\ncertainly not so deeply as I should have been had our relations in\r\nchildhood been different. We were separated, according to the common\r\ncustom, when I was but an infant, and, of course, before I knew my\r\nmother from any one else.\r\n\r\nThe germs of affection with which the Almighty, in his wisdom and\r\nmercy, arms the hopeless infant against the ills and vicissitudes of\r\nhis lot, had been directed in their growth toward that loving old\r\ngrandmother, whose gentle hand and kind deportment it was in the first\r\neffort of my infantile understanding to comprehend and appreciate.\r\nAccordingly, the tenderest affection which a beneficent Father allows,\r\nas a partial compensation to the mother for the pains and lacerations\r\nof her heart, incident to the maternal relation, was, in my case,\r\ndiverted from its true and natural object, by the envious, greedy, and\r\ntreacherous hand of slavery. The slave-mother can be spared long enough\r\nfrom the field to endure all the bitterness of a mother’s anguish, when\r\nit adds another name to a master’s ledger, but _not_ long enough to\r\nreceive the joyous reward afforded by the intelligent smiles of her\r\nchild. I never think of this terrible interference of slavery with my\r\ninfantile affections, and its diverting them from their natural course,\r\nwithout feelings to which I can give no adequate expression.\r\n\r\nI do not remember to have seen my mother at my grandmother’s at any\r\ntime. I remember her only in her visits to me at Col. Lloyd’s\r\nplantation, and in the kitchen of my old master. Her visits to me there\r\nwere few in number, brief in duration, and mostly made in the night.\r\nThe pains she took, and the toil she endured, to see me, tells me that\r\na true mother’s heart was hers, and that slavery had difficulty in\r\nparalyzing it with unmotherly indifference.\r\n\r\nMy mother was hired out to a Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve miles\r\nfrom old master’s, and, being a field hand, she seldom had leisure, by\r\nday, for the performance of the journey. The nights and the distance\r\nwere both obstacles to her visits. She was obliged to walk, unless\r\nchance flung into her way an opportunity to ride; and the latter was\r\nsometimes her good luck. But she always had to walk one way or the\r\nother. It was a greater luxury than slavery could afford, to allow a\r\nblack slave-mother a horse or a mule, upon which to travel twenty-four\r\nmiles, when she could walk the distance. Besides, it is deemed a\r\nfoolish whim for a slave-mother to manifest concern to see her\r\nchildren, and, in one point of view, the case is made out—she can do\r\nnothing for them. She has no control over them; the master is even more\r\nthan the mother, in all matters touching the fate of her child. Why,\r\nthen, should she give herself any concern? She has no responsibility.\r\nSuch is the reasoning, and such the practice. The iron rule of the\r\nplantation, always passionately and violently enforced in that\r\nneighborhood, makes flogging the penalty of failing to be in the field\r\nbefore sunrise in the morning, unless special permission be given to\r\nthe absenting slave. “I went to see my child,” is no excuse to the ear\r\nor heart of the overseer.\r\n\r\nOne of the visits of my mother to me, while at Col. Lloyd’s, I remember\r\nvery vividly, as affording a bright gleam of a mother’s love, and the\r\nearnestness of a mother’s care.\r\n\r\n“I had on that day offended “Aunt Katy,” (called “Aunt” by way of\r\nrespect,) the cook of old master’s establishment. I do not now remember\r\nthe nature of my offense in this instance, for my offenses were\r\nnumerous in that quarter, greatly depending, however, upon the mood of\r\nAunt Katy, as to their heinousness; but she had adopted, that day, her\r\nfavorite mode of punishing me, namely, making me go without food all\r\nday—that is, from after breakfast. The first hour or two after dinner,\r\nI succeeded pretty well in keeping up my spirits; but though I made an\r\nexcellent stand against the foe, and fought bravely during the\r\nafternoon, I knew I must be conquered at last, unless I got the\r\naccustomed reenforcement of a slice of corn bread, at sundown. Sundown\r\ncame, but _no bread_, and, in its stead, their came the threat, with a\r\nscowl well suited to its terrible import, that she “meant to _starve\r\nthe life out of me!”_ Brandishing her knife, she chopped off the heavy\r\nslices for the other children, and put the loaf away, muttering, all\r\nthe while, her savage designs upon myself. Against this disappointment,\r\nfor I was expecting that her heart would relent at last, I made an\r\nextra effort to maintain my dignity; but when I saw all the other\r\nchildren around me with merry and satisfied faces, I could stand it no\r\nlonger. I went out behind the house, and cried like a fine fellow! When\r\ntired of this, I returned to the kitchen, sat by the fire, and brooded\r\nover my hard lot. I was too hungry to sleep. While I sat in the corner,\r\nI caught sight of an ear of Indian corn on an upper shelf of the\r\nkitchen. I watched my chance, and got it, and, shelling off a few\r\ngrains, I put it back again. The grains in my hand, I quickly put in\r\nsome ashes, and covered them with embers, to roast them. All this I did\r\nat the risk of getting a brutual thumping, for Aunt Katy could beat, as\r\nwell as starve me. My corn was not long in roasting, and, with my keen\r\nappetite, it did not matter even if the grains were not exactly done. I\r\neagerly pulled them out, and placed them on my stool, in a clever\r\nlittle pile. Just as I began to help myself to my very dry meal, in\r\ncame my dear mother. And now, dear reader, a scene occurred which was\r\naltogether worth beholding, and to me it was instructive as well as\r\ninteresting. The friendless and hungry boy, in his extremest need—and\r\nwhen he did not dare to look for succor—found himself in the strong,\r\nprotecting arms of a mother; a mother who was, at the moment (being\r\nendowed with high powers of manner as well as matter) more than a match\r\nfor all his enemies. I shall never forget the indescribable expression\r\nof her countenance, when I told her that I had had no food since\r\nmorning; and that Aunt Katy said she “meant to starve the life out of\r\nme.” There was pity in her glance at me, and a fiery indignation at\r\nAunt Katy at the same time; and, while she took the corn from me, and\r\ngave me a large ginger cake, in its stead, she read Aunt Katy a lecture\r\nwhich she never forgot. My mother threatened her with complaining to\r\nold master in my behalf; for the latter, though harsh and cruel\r\nhimself, at times, did not sanction the meanness, injustice, partiality\r\nand oppressions enacted by Aunt Katy in the kitchen. That night I\r\nlearned the fact, that I was, not only a child, but _somebody’s_ child.\r\nThe “sweet cake” my mother gave me was in the shape of a heart, with a\r\nrich, dark ring glazed upon the edge of it. I was victorious, and well\r\noff for the moment; prouder, on my mother’s knee, than a king upon his\r\nthrone. But my triumph was short. I dropped off to sleep, and waked in\r\nthe morning only to find my mother gone, and myself left at the mercy\r\nof the sable virago, dominant in my old master’s kitchen, whose fiery\r\nwrath was my constant dread.\r\n\r\nI do not remember to have seen my mother after this occurrence. Death\r\nsoon ended the little communication that had existed between us; and\r\nwith it, I believe, a life judging from her weary, sad, down-cast\r\ncountenance and mute demeanor—full of heartfelt sorrow. I was not\r\nallowed to visit her during any part of her long illness; nor did I see\r\nher for a long time before she was taken ill and died. The heartless\r\nand ghastly form of _slavery_ rises between mother and child, even at\r\nthe bed of death. The mother, at the verge of the grave, may not gather\r\nher children, to impart to them her holy admonitions, and invoke for\r\nthem her dying benediction. The bond-woman lives as a slave, and is\r\nleft to die as a beast; often with fewer attentions than are paid to a\r\nfavorite horse. Scenes of sacred tenderness, around the death-bed,\r\nnever forgotten, and which often arrest the vicious and confirm the\r\nvirtuous during life, must be looked for among the free, though they\r\nsometimes occur among the slaves. It has been a life-long, standing\r\ngrief to me, that I knew so little of my mother; and that I was so\r\nearly separated from her. The counsels of her love must have been\r\nbeneficial to me. The side view of her face is imaged on my memory, and\r\nI take few steps in life, without feeling her presence; but the image\r\nis mute, and I have no striking words of her’s treasured up.\r\n\r\nI learned, after my mother’s death, that she could read, and that she\r\nwas the _only_ one of all the slaves and colored people in Tuckahoe who\r\nenjoyed that advantage. How she acquired this knowledge, I know not,\r\nfor Tuckahoe is the last place in the world where she would be apt to\r\nfind facilities for learning. I can, therefore, fondly and proudly\r\nascribe to her an earnest love of knowledge. That a “field hand” should\r\nlearn to read, in any slave state, is remarkable; but the achievement\r\nof my mother, considering the place, was very extraordinary; and, in\r\nview of that fact, I am quite willing, and even happy, to attribute any\r\nlove of letters I possess, and for which I have got—despite of\r\nprejudices only too much credit, _not_ to my admitted Anglo-Saxon\r\npaternity, but to the native genius of my sable, unprotected, and\r\nuncultivated _mother_—a woman, who belonged to a race whose mental\r\nendowments it is, at present, fashionable to hold in disparagement and\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nSummoned away to her account, with the impassable gulf of slavery\r\nbetween us during her entire illness, my mother died without leaving me\r\na single intimation of _who_ my father was. There was a whisper, that\r\nmy master was my father; yet it was only a whisper, and I cannot say\r\nthat I ever gave it credence. Indeed, I now have reason to think he was\r\nnot; nevertheless, the fact remains, in all its glaring odiousness,\r\nthat, by the laws of slavery, children, in all cases, are reduced to\r\nthe condition of their mothers. This arrangement admits of the greatest\r\nlicense to brutal slaveholders, and their profligate sons, brothers,\r\nrelations and friends, and gives to the pleasure of sin, the additional\r\nattraction of profit. A whole volume might be written on this single\r\nfeature of slavery, as I have observed it.\r\n\r\nOne might imagine, that the children of such connections, would fare\r\nbetter, in the hands of their masters, than other slaves. The rule is\r\nquite the other way; and a very little reflection will satisfy the\r\nreader that such is the case. A man who will enslave his own blood, may\r\nnot be safely relied on for magnanimity. Men do not love those who\r\nremind them of their sins unless they have a mind to repent—and the\r\nmulatto child’s face is a standing accusation against him who is master\r\nand father to the child. What is still worse, perhaps, such a child is\r\na constant offense to the wife. She hates its very presence, and when a\r\nslaveholding woman hates, she wants not means to give that hate telling\r\neffect. Women—white women, I mean—are IDOLS at the south, not WIVES,\r\nfor the slave women are preferred in many instances; and if these\r\n_idols_ but nod, or lift a finger, woe to the poor victim: kicks, cuffs\r\nand stripes are sure to follow. Masters are frequently compelled to\r\nsell this class of their slaves, out of deference to the feelings of\r\ntheir white wives; and shocking and scandalous as it may seem for a man\r\nto sell his own blood to the traffickers in human flesh, it is often an\r\nact of humanity toward the slave-child to be thus removed from his\r\nmerciless tormentors.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of the design of my simple story, to comment\r\nupon every phase of slavery not within my experience as a slave.\r\n\r\nBut, I may remark, that, if the lineal descendants of Ham are only to\r\nbe enslaved, according to the scriptures, slavery in this country will\r\nsoon become an unscriptural institution; for thousands are ushered into\r\nthe world, annually, who—like myself—owe their existence to white\r\nfathers, and, most frequently, to their masters, and master’s sons. The\r\nslave-woman is at the mercy of the fathers, sons or brothers of her\r\nmaster. The thoughtful know the rest.\r\n\r\nAfter what I have now said of the circumstances of my mother, and my\r\nrelations to her, the reader will not be surprised, nor be disposed to\r\ncensure me, when I tell but the simple truth, viz: that I received the\r\ntidings of her death with no strong emotions of sorrow for her, and\r\nwith very little regret for myself on account of her loss. I had to\r\nlearn the value of my mother long after her death, and by witnessing\r\nthe devotion of other mothers to their children.\r\n\r\nThere is not, beneath the sky, an enemy to filial affection so\r\ndestructive as slavery. It had made my brothers and sisters strangers\r\nto me; it converted the mother that bore me, into a myth; it shrouded\r\nmy father in mystery, and left me without an intelligible beginning in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nMy mother died when I could not have been more than eight or nine years\r\nold, on one of old master’s farms in Tuckahoe, in the neighborhood of\r\nHillsborough. Her grave is, as the grave of the dead at sea, unmarked,\r\nand without stone or stake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. _A General Survey of the Slave Plantation_\r\n\r\n\r\nISOLATION OF LLOYD S PLANTATION—PUBLIC OPINION THERE NO PROTECTION TO\r\nTHE SLAVE—ABSOLUTE POWER OF THE OVERSEER—NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL CHARMS\r\nOF THE PLACE—ITS BUSINESS-LIKE APPEARANCE—SUPERSTITION ABOUT THE BURIAL\r\nGROUND—GREAT IDEAS OF COL.

LLOYD—FAMILY OF CAPT. ANTHONY—HIS SOCIAL POSITION—NOTIONS OF RANK\r\nAND STATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that slavery, in the state of Maryland, exists\r\nin its mildest form, and that it is totally divested of those harsh and\r\nterrible peculiarities, which mark and characterize the slave system,\r\nin the southern and south-western states of the American union. The\r\nargument in favor of this opinion, is the contiguity of the free\r\nstates, and the exposed condition of slavery in Maryland to the moral,\r\nreligious and humane sentiment of the free states.\r\n\r\nI am not about to refute this argument, so far as it relates to slavery\r\nin that state, generally; on the contrary, I am willing to admit that,\r\nto this general point, the arguments is well grounded. Public opinion\r\nis, indeed, an unfailing restraint upon the cruelty and barbarity of\r\nmasters, overseers, and slave-drivers, whenever and wherever it can\r\nreach them; but there are certain secluded and out-of-the-way places,\r\neven in the state of Maryland, seldom visited by a single ray of\r\nhealthy public sentiment—where slavery, wrapt in its own congenial,\r\nmidnight darkness, _can_, and _does_, develop all its malign and\r\nshocking characteristics; where it can be indecent without shame, cruel\r\nwithout shuddering, and murderous without apprehension or fear of\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nJust such a secluded, dark, and out-of-the-way place, is the “home\r\nplantation” of Col. Edward Lloyd, on the Eastern Shore, Maryland. It is\r\nfar away from all the great thoroughfares, and is proximate to no town\r\nor village. There is neither school-house, nor town-house in its\r\nneighborhood. The school-house is unnecessary, for there are no\r\nchildren to go to school. The children and grand-children of Col. Lloyd\r\nwere taught in the house, by a private tutor—a Mr. Page a tall, gaunt\r\nsapling of a man, who did not speak a dozen words to a slave in a whole\r\nyear. The overseers’ children go off somewhere to school; and they,\r\ntherefore, bring no foreign or dangerous influence from abroad, to\r\nembarrass the natural operation of the slave system of the place. Not\r\neven the mechanics—through whom there is an occasional out-burst of\r\nhonest and telling indignation, at cruelty and wrong on other\r\nplantations—are white men, on this plantation. Its whole public is made\r\nup of, and divided into, three classes—SLAVEHOLDERS, SLAVES and\r\nOVERSEERS. Its blacksmiths, wheelwrights, shoemakers, weavers, and\r\ncoopers, are slaves. Not even commerce, selfish and iron-hearted at it\r\nis, and ready, as it ever is, to side with the strong against the\r\nweak—the rich against the poor—is trusted or permitted within its\r\nsecluded precincts. Whether with a view of guarding against the escape\r\nof its secrets, I know not, but it is a fact, the every leaf and grain\r\nof the produce of this plantation, and those of the neighboring farms\r\nbelonging to Col. Lloyd, are transported to Baltimore in Col. Lloyd’s\r\nown vessels; every man and boy on board of which—except the captain—are\r\nowned by him. In return, everything brought to the plantation, comes\r\nthrough the same channel. Thus, even the glimmering and unsteady light\r\nof trade, which sometimes exerts a civilizing influence, is excluded\r\nfrom this “tabooed” spot.\r\n\r\nNearly all the plantations or farms in the vicinity of the “home\r\nplantation” of Col. Lloyd, belong to him; and those which do not, are\r\nowned by personal friends of his, as deeply interested in maintaining\r\nthe slave system, in all its rigor, as Col. Lloyd himself. Some of his\r\nneighbors are said to be even more stringent than he. The Skinners, the\r\nPeakers, the Tilgmans, the Lockermans, and the Gipsons, are in the same\r\nboat; being slaveholding neighbors, they may have strengthened each\r\nother in their iron rule. They are on intimate terms, and their\r\ninterests and tastes are identical.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in such a quarter, the reader will see, is not likely to\r\nvery efficient in protecting the slave from cruelty. On the contrary,\r\nit must increase and intensify his wrongs. Public opinion seldom\r\ndiffers very widely from public practice. To be a restraint upon\r\ncruelty and vice, public opinion must emanate from a humane and\r\nvirtuous community. To no such humane and virtuous community, is Col.\r\nLloyd’s plantation exposed. That plantation is a little nation of its\r\nown, having its own language, its own rules, regulations and customs.\r\nThe laws and institutions of the state, apparently touch it nowhere.\r\nThe troubles arising here, are not settled by the civil power of the\r\nstate. The overseer is generally accuser, judge, jury, advocate and\r\nexecutioner. The criminal is always dumb. The overseer attends to all\r\nsides of a case.\r\n\r\nThere are no conflicting rights of property, for all the people are\r\nowned by one man; and they can themselves own no property. Religion and\r\npolitics are alike excluded. One class of the population is too high to\r\nbe reached by the preacher; and the other class is too low to be cared\r\nfor by the preacher. The poor have the gospel preached to them, in this\r\nneighborhood, only when they are able to pay for it. The slaves, having\r\nno money, get no gospel. The politician keeps away, because the people\r\nhave no votes, and the preacher keeps away, because the people have no\r\nmoney. The rich planter can afford to learn politics in the parlor, and\r\nto dispense with religion altogether.\r\n\r\nIn its isolation, seclusion, and self-reliant independence, Col.\r\nLloyd’s plantation resembles what the baronial domains were during the\r\nmiddle ages in Europe. Grim, cold, and unapproachable by all genial\r\ninfluences from communities without, _there it stands;_ full three\r\nhundred years behind the age, in all that relates to humanity and\r\nmorals.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not the only view that the place presents.\r\nCivilization is shut out, but nature cannot be. Though separated from\r\nthe rest of the world; though public opinion, as I have said, seldom\r\ngets a chance to penetrate its dark domain; though the whole place is\r\nstamped with its own peculiar, ironlike individuality; and though\r\ncrimes, high-handed and atrocious, may there be committed, with almost\r\nas much impunity as upon the deck of a pirate ship—it is, nevertheless,\r\naltogether, to outward seeming, a most strikingly interesting place,\r\nfull of life, activity, and spirit; and presents a very favorable\r\ncontrast to the indolent monotony and languor of Tuckahoe. Keen as was\r\nmy regret and great as was my sorrow at leaving the latter, I was not\r\nlong in adapting myself to this, my new home. A man’s troubles are\r\nalways half disposed of, when he finds endurance his only remedy. I\r\nfound myself here; there was no getting away; and what remained for me,\r\nbut to make the best of it? Here were plenty of children to play with,\r\nand plenty of places of pleasant resort for boys of my age, and boys\r\nolder. The little tendrils of affection, so rudely and treacherously\r\nbroken from around the darling objects of my grandmother’s hut,\r\ngradually began to extend, and to entwine about the new objects by\r\nwhich I now found myself surrounded.\r\n\r\nThere was a windmill (always a commanding object to a child’s eye) on\r\nLong Point—a tract of land dividing Miles river from the Wye a mile or\r\nmore from my old master’s house. There was a creek to swim in, at the\r\nbottom of an open flat space, of twenty acres or more, called “the Long\r\nGreen”—a very beautiful play-ground for the children.\r\n\r\nIn the river, a short distance from the shore, lying quietly at anchor,\r\nwith her small boat dancing at her stern, was a large sloop—the Sally\r\nLloyd; called by that name in honor of a favorite daughter of the\r\ncolonel. The sloop and the mill were wondrous things, full of thoughts\r\nand ideas. A child cannot well look at such objects without _thinking_.\r\n\r\nThen here were a great many houses; human habitations, full of the\r\nmysteries of life at every stage of it. There was the little red house,\r\nup the road, occupied by Mr. Sevier, the overseer. A little nearer to\r\nmy old master’s, stood a very long, rough, low building, literally\r\nalive with slaves, of all ages, conditions and sizes. This was called\r\n“the Longe Quarter.” Perched upon a hill, across the Long Green, was a\r\nvery tall, dilapidated, old brick building—the architectural dimensions\r\nof which proclaimed its erection for a different purpose—now occupied\r\nby slaves, in a similar manner to the Long Quarter. Besides these,\r\nthere were numerous other slave houses and huts, scattered around in\r\nthe neighborhood, every nook and corner of which was completely\r\noccupied. Old master’s house, a long, brick building, plain, but\r\nsubstantial, stood in the center of the plantation life, and\r\nconstituted one independent establishment on the premises of Col.\r\nLloyd.\r\n\r\nBesides these dwellings, there were barns, stables, store-houses, and\r\ntobacco-houses; blacksmiths’ shops, wheelwrights’ shops, coopers’\r\nshops—all objects of interest; but, above all, there stood the grandest\r\nbuilding my eyes had then ever beheld, called, by every one on the\r\nplantation, the “Great House.” This was occupied by Col. Lloyd and his\r\nfamily. They occupied it; _I_ enjoyed it. The great house was\r\nsurrounded by numerous and variously shaped out-buildings. There were\r\nkitchens, wash-houses, dairies, summer-house, green-houses, hen-houses,\r\nturkey-houses, pigeon-houses, and arbors, of many sizes and devices,\r\nall neatly painted, and altogether interspersed with grand old trees,\r\nornamental and primitive, which afforded delightful shade in summer,\r\nand imparted to the scene a high degree of stately beauty. The great\r\nhouse itself was a large, white, wooden building, with wings on three\r\nsides of it. In front, a large portico, extending the entire length of\r\nthe building, and supported by a long range of columns, gave to the\r\nwhole establishment an air of solemn grandeur. It was a treat to my\r\nyoung and gradually opening mind, to behold this elaborate exhibition\r\nof wealth, power, and vanity. The carriage entrance to the house was a\r\nlarge gate, more than a quarter of a mile distant from it; the\r\nintermediate space was a beautiful lawn, very neatly trimmed, and\r\nwatched with the greatest care. It was dotted thickly over with\r\ndelightful trees, shrubbery, and flowers. The road, or lane, from the\r\ngate to the great house, was richly paved with white pebbles from the\r\nbeach, and, in its course, formed a complete circle around the\r\nbeautiful lawn. Carriages going in and retiring from the great house,\r\nmade the circuit of the lawn, and their passengers were permitted to\r\nbehold a scene of almost Eden-like beauty. Outside this select\r\ninclosure, were parks, where as about the residences of the English\r\nnobility—rabbits, deer, and other wild game, might be seen, peering and\r\nplaying about, with none to molest them or make them afraid. The tops\r\nof the stately poplars were often covered with the red-winged\r\nblack-birds, making all nature vocal with the joyous life and beauty of\r\ntheir wild, warbling notes. These all belonged to me, as well as to\r\nCol. Edward Lloyd, and for a time I greatly enjoyed them.\r\n\r\nA short distance from the great house, were the stately mansions of the\r\ndead, a place of somber aspect. Vast tombs, embowered beneath the\r\nweeping willow and the fir tree, told of the antiquities of the Lloyd\r\nfamily, as well as of their wealth. Superstition was rife among the\r\nslaves about this family burying ground. Strange sights had been seen\r\nthere by some of the older slaves. Shrouded ghosts, riding on great\r\nblack horses, had been seen to enter; balls of fire had been seen to\r\nfly there at midnight, and horrid sounds had been repeatedly heard.\r\nSlaves know enough of the rudiments of theology to believe that those\r\ngo to hell who die slaveholders; and they often fancy such persons\r\nwishing themselves back again, to wield the lash. Tales of sights and\r\nsounds, strange and terrible, connected with the huge black tombs, were\r\na very great security to the grounds about them, for few of the slaves\r\nfelt like approaching them even in the day time. It was a dark, gloomy\r\nand forbidding place, and it was difficult to feel that the spirits of\r\nthe sleeping dust there deposited, reigned with the blest in the realms\r\nof eternal peace.\r\n\r\nThe business of twenty or thirty farms was transacted at this, called,\r\nby way of eminence, “great house farm.” These farms all belonged to\r\nCol. Lloyd, as did, also, the slaves upon them. Each farm was under the\r\nmanagement of an overseer. As I have said of the overseer of the home\r\nplantation, so I may say of the overseers on the smaller ones; they\r\nstand between the slave and all civil constitutions—their word is law,\r\nand is implicitly obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe colonel, at this time, was reputed to be, and he apparently was,\r\nvery rich. His slaves, alone, were an immense fortune. These, small and\r\ngreat, could not have been fewer than one thousand in number, and\r\nthough scarcely a month passed without the sale of one or more lots to\r\nthe Georgia traders, there was no apparent diminution in the number of\r\nhis human stock: the home plantation merely groaned at a removal of the\r\nyoung increase, or human crop, then proceeded as lively as ever.\r\nHorse-shoeing, cart-mending, plow-repairing, coopering, grinding, and\r\nweaving, for all the neighboring farms, were performed here, and slaves\r\nwere employed in all these branches. “Uncle Tony” was the blacksmith;\r\n“Uncle Harry” was the cartwright; “Uncle Abel” was the shoemaker; and\r\nall these had hands to assist them in their several departments.\r\n\r\nThese mechanics were called “uncles” by all the younger slaves, not\r\nbecause they really sustained that relationship to any, but according\r\nto plantation _etiquette_, as a mark of respect, due from the younger\r\nto the older slaves. Strange, and even ridiculous as it may seem, among\r\na people so uncultivated, and with so many stern trials to look in the\r\nface, there is not to be found, among any people, a more rigid\r\nenforcement of the law of respect to elders, than they maintain. I set\r\nthis down as partly constitutional with my race, and partly\r\nconventional. There is no better material in the world for making a\r\ngentleman, than is furnished in the African. He shows to others, and\r\nexacts for himself, all the tokens of respect which he is compelled to\r\nmanifest toward his master. A young slave must approach the company of\r\nthe older with hat in hand, and woe betide him, if he fails to\r\nacknowledge a favor, of any sort, with the accustomed _“tank’ee,”_ &c.\r\nSo uniformly are good manners enforced among slaves, I can easily\r\ndetect a “bogus” fugitive by his manners.\r\n\r\nAmong other slave notabilities of the plantation, was one called by\r\neverybody Uncle Isaac Copper. It is seldom that a slave gets a surname\r\nfrom anybody in Maryland; and so completely has the south shaped the\r\nmanners of the north, in this respect, that even abolitionists make\r\nvery little of the surname of a Negro. The only improvement on the\r\n“Bills,” “Jacks,” “Jims,” and “Neds” of the south, observable here is,\r\nthat “William,” “John,” “James,” “Edward,” are substituted. It goes\r\nagainst the grain to treat and address a Negro precisely as they would\r\ntreat and address a white man. But, once in a while, in slavery as in\r\nthe free states, by some extraordinary circumstance, the Negro has a\r\nsurname fastened to him, and holds it against all conventionalities.\r\nThis was the case with Uncle Isaac Copper. When the “uncle” was\r\ndropped, he generally had the prefix “doctor,” in its stead. He was our\r\ndoctor of medicine, and doctor of divinity as well. Where he took his\r\ndegree I am unable to say, for he was not very communicative to\r\ninferiors, and I was emphatically such, being but a boy seven or eight\r\nyears old. He was too well established in his profession to permit\r\nquestions as to his native skill, or his attainments. One qualification\r\nhe undoubtedly had—he was a confirmed _cripple;_ and he could neither\r\nwork, nor would he bring anything if offered for sale in the market.\r\nThe old man, though lame, was no sluggard. He was a man that made his\r\ncrutches do him good service. He was always on the alert, looking up\r\nthe sick, and all such as were supposed to need his counsel. His\r\nremedial prescriptions embraced four articles. For diseases of the\r\nbody, _Epsom salts and castor oil;_ for those of the soul, _the Lord’s\r\nPrayer_, and _hickory switches_!\r\n\r\nI was not long at Col. Lloyd’s before I was placed under the care of\r\nDoctor Issac Copper. I was sent to him with twenty or thirty other\r\nchildren, to learn the “Lord’s Prayer.” I found the old gentleman\r\nseated on a huge three-legged oaken stool, armed with several large\r\nhickory switches; and, from his position, he could reach—lame as he\r\nwas—any boy in the room. After standing awhile to learn what was\r\nexpected of us, the old gentleman, in any other than a devotional tone,\r\ncommanded us to kneel down. This done, he commenced telling us to say\r\neverything he said. “Our Father”—this was repeated after him with\r\npromptness and uniformity; “Who art in heaven”—was less promptly and\r\nuniformly repeated; and the old gentleman paused in the prayer, to give\r\nus a short lecture upon the consequences of inattention, both immediate\r\nand future, and especially those more immediate. About these he was\r\nabsolutely certain, for he held in his right hand the means of bringing\r\nall his predictions and warnings to pass. On he proceeded with the\r\nprayer; and we with our thick tongues and unskilled ears, followed him\r\nto the best of our ability. This, however, was not sufficient to please\r\nthe old gentleman. Everybody, in the south, wants the privilege of\r\nwhipping somebody else. Uncle Isaac shared the common passion of his\r\ncountry, and, therefore, seldom found any means of keeping his\r\ndisciples in order short of flogging. “Say everything I say;” and bang\r\nwould come the switch on some poor boy’s undevotional head. _“What you\r\nlooking at there”—“Stop that pushing”_—and down again would come the\r\nlash.\r\n\r\nThe whip is all in all. It is supposed to secure obedience to the\r\nslaveholder, and is held as a sovereign remedy among the slaves\r\nthemselves, for every form of disobedience, temporal or spiritual.\r\nSlaves, as well as slaveholders, use it with an unsparing hand. Our\r\ndevotions at Uncle Isaac’s combined too much of the tragic and comic,\r\nto make them very salutary in a spiritual point of view; and it is due\r\nto truth to say, I was often a truant when the time for attending the\r\npraying and flogging of Doctor Isaac Copper came on.\r\n\r\nThe windmill under the care of Mr. Kinney, a kind hearted old\r\nEnglishman, was to me a source of infinite interest and pleasure. The\r\nold man always seemed pleased when he saw a troop of darkey little\r\nurchins, with their tow-linen shirts fluttering in the breeze,\r\napproaching to view and admire the whirling wings of his wondrous\r\nmachine. From the mill we could see other objects of deep interest.\r\nThese were, the vessels from St. Michael’s, on their way to Baltimore.\r\nIt was a source of much amusement to view the flowing sails and\r\ncomplicated rigging, as the little crafts dashed by, and to speculate\r\nupon Baltimore, as to the kind and quality of the place. With so many\r\nsources of interest around me, the reader may be prepared to learn that\r\nI began to think very highly of Col. L.‘s plantation. It was just a\r\nplace to my boyish taste. There were fish to be caught in the creek, if\r\none only had a hook and line; and crabs, clams and oysters were to be\r\ncaught by wading, digging and raking for them. Here was a field for\r\nindustry and enterprise, strongly inviting; and the reader may be\r\nassured that I entered upon it with spirit.\r\n\r\nEven the much dreaded old master, whose merciless fiat had brought me\r\nfrom Tuckahoe, gradually, to my mind, parted with his terrors. Strange\r\nenough, his reverence seemed to take no particular notice of me, nor of\r\nmy coming. Instead of leaping out and devouring me, he scarcely seemed\r\nconscious of my presence. The fact is, he was occupied with matters\r\nmore weighty and important than either looking after or vexing me. He\r\nprobably thought as little of my advent, as he would have thought of\r\nthe addition of a single pig to his stock!\r\n\r\nAs the chief butler on Col. Lloyd’s plantation, his duties were\r\nnumerous and perplexing. In almost all important matters he answered in\r\nCol. Lloyd’s stead. The overseers of all the farms were in some sort\r\nunder him, and received the law from his mouth. The colonel himself\r\nseldom addressed an overseer, or allowed an overseer to address him.\r\nOld master carried the keys of all store houses; measured out the\r\nallowance for each slave at the end of every month; superintended the\r\nstoring of all goods brought to the plantation; dealt out the raw\r\nmaterial to all the handicraftsmen; shipped the grain, tobacco, and all\r\nsaleable produce of the plantation to market, and had the general\r\noversight of the coopers’ shop, wheelwrights’ shop, blacksmiths’ shop,\r\nand shoemakers’ shop. Besides the care of these, he often had business\r\nfor the plantation which required him to be absent two and three days.\r\n\r\nThus largely employed, he had little time, and perhaps as little\r\ndisposition, to interfere with the children individually. What he was\r\nto Col. Lloyd, he made Aunt Katy to him. When he had anything to say or\r\ndo about us, it was said or done in a wholesale manner; disposing of us\r\nin classes or sizes, leaving all minor details to Aunt Katy, a person\r\nof whom the reader has already received no very favorable impression.\r\nAunt Katy was a woman who never allowed herself to act greatly within\r\nthe margin of power granted to her, no matter how broad that authority\r\nmight be. Ambitious, ill-tempered and cruel, she found in her present\r\nposition an ample field for the exercise of her ill-omened qualities.\r\nShe had a strong hold on old master she was considered a first rate\r\ncook, and she really was very industrious. She was, therefore, greatly\r\nfavored by old master, and as one mark of his favor, she was the only\r\nmother who was permitted to retain her children around her. Even to\r\nthese children she was often fiendish in her brutality. She pursued her\r\nson Phil, one day, in my presence, with a huge butcher knife, and dealt\r\na blow with its edge which left a shocking gash on his arm, near the\r\nwrist. For this, old master did sharply rebuke her, and threatened that\r\nif she ever should do the like again, he would take the skin off her\r\nback. Cruel, however, as Aunt Katy was to her own children, at times\r\nshe was not destitute of maternal feeling, as I often had occasion to\r\nknow, in the bitter pinches of hunger I had to endure. Differing from\r\nthe practice of Col. Lloyd, old master, instead of allowing so much for\r\neach slave, committed the allowance for all to the care of Aunt Katy,\r\nto be divided after cooking it, amongst us. The allowance, consisting\r\nof coarse corn-meal, was not very abundant—indeed, it was very slender;\r\nand in passing through Aunt Katy’s hands, it was made more slender\r\nstill, for some of us. William, Phil and Jerry were her children, and\r\nit is not to accuse her too severely, to allege that she was often\r\nguilty of starving myself and the other children, while she was\r\nliterally cramming her own. Want of food was my chief trouble the first\r\nsummer at my old master’s. Oysters and clams would do very well, with\r\nan occasional supply of bread, but they soon failed in the absence of\r\nbread. I speak but the simple truth, when I say, I have often been so\r\npinched with hunger, that I have fought with the dog—“Old Nep”—for the\r\nsmallest crumbs that fell from the kitchen table, and have been glad\r\nwhen I won a single crumb in the combat. Many times have I followed,\r\nwith eager step, the waiting-girl when she went out to shake the table\r\ncloth, to get the crumbs and small bones flung out for the cats. The\r\nwater, in which meat had been boiled, was as eagerly sought for by me.\r\nIt was a great thing to get the privilege of dipping a piece of bread\r\nin such water; and the skin taken from rusty bacon, was a positive\r\nluxury. Nevertheless, I sometimes got full meals and kind words from\r\nsympathizing old slaves, who knew my sufferings, and received the\r\ncomforting assurance that I should be a man some day. “Never mind,\r\nhoney—better day comin’,” was even then a solace, a cheering\r\nconsolation to me in my troubles. Nor were all the kind words I\r\nreceived from slaves. I had a friend in the parlor, as well, and one to\r\nwhom I shall be glad to do justice, before I have finished this part of\r\nmy story.\r\n\r\nI was not long at old master’s, before I learned that his surname was\r\nAnthony, and that he was generally called “Captain Anthony”—a title\r\nwhich he probably acquired by sailing a craft in the Chesapeake Bay.\r\nCol. Lloyd’s slaves never called Capt. Anthony “old master,” but always\r\nCapt. Anthony; and _me_ they called “Captain Anthony Fred.” There is\r\nnot, probably, in the whole south, a plantation where the English\r\nlanguage is more imperfectly spoken than on Col. Lloyd’s. It is a\r\nmixture of Guinea and everything else you please. At the time of which\r\nI am now writing, there were slaves there who had been brought from the\r\ncoast of Africa. They never used the “s” in indication of the\r\npossessive case. “Cap’n Ant’ney Tom,” “Lloyd Bill,” “Aunt Rose Harry,”\r\nmeans “Captain Anthony’s Tom,” “Lloyd’s Bill,” &c. _“Oo you dem long\r\nto?”_ means, “Whom do you belong to?” _“Oo dem got any peachy?”_ means,\r\n“Have you got any peaches?” I could scarcely understand them when I\r\nfirst went among them, so broken was their speech; and I am persuaded\r\nthat I could not have been dropped anywhere on the globe, where I could\r\nreap less, in the way of knowledge, from my immediate associates, than\r\non this plantation. Even “MAS’ DANIEL,” by his association with his\r\nfather’s slaves, had measurably adopted their dialect and their ideas,\r\nso far as they had ideas to be adopted. The equality of nature is\r\nstrongly asserted in childhood, and childhood requires children for\r\nassociates. _Color_ makes no difference with a child. Are you a child\r\nwith wants, tastes and pursuits common to children, not put on, but\r\nnatural? then, were you black as ebony you would be welcome to the\r\nchild of alabaster whiteness. The law of compensation holds here, as\r\nwell as elsewhere. Mas’ Daniel could not associate with ignorance\r\nwithout sharing its shade; and he could not give his black playmates\r\nhis company, without giving them his intelligence, as well. Without\r\nknowing this, or caring about it, at the time, I, for some cause or\r\nother, spent much of my time with Mas’ Daniel, in preference to\r\nspending it with most of the other boys.\r\n\r\nMas’ Daniel was the youngest son of Col. Lloyd; his older brothers were\r\nEdward and Murray—both grown up, and fine looking men. Edward was\r\nespecially esteemed by the children, and by me among the rest; not that\r\nhe ever said anything to us or for us, which could be called especially\r\nkind; it was enough for us, that he never looked nor acted scornfully\r\ntoward us. There were also three sisters, all married; one to Edward\r\nWinder; a second to Edward Nicholson; a third to Mr. Lownes.\r\n\r\nThe family of old master consisted of two sons, Andrew and Richard; his\r\ndaughter, Lucretia, and her newly married husband, Capt. Auld. This was\r\nthe house family. The kitchen family consisted of Aunt Katy, Aunt\r\nEsther, and ten or a dozen children, most of them older than myself.\r\nCapt. Anthony was not considered a rich slaveholder, but was pretty\r\nwell off in the world. He owned about thirty _“head”_ of slaves, and\r\nthree farms in Tuckahoe. The most valuable part of his property was his\r\nslaves, of whom he could afford to sell one every year. This crop,\r\ntherefore, brought him seven or eight hundred dollars a year, besides\r\nhis yearly salary, and other revenue from his farms.\r\n\r\nThe idea of rank and station was rigidly maintained on Col. Lloyd’s\r\nplantation. Our family never visited the great house, and the Lloyds\r\nnever came to our home. Equal non-intercourse was observed between\r\nCapt. Anthony’s family and that of Mr. Sevier, the overseer.\r\n\r\nSuch, kind reader, was the community, and such the place, in which my\r\nearliest and most lasting impressions of slavery, and of slave-life,\r\nwere received; of which impressions you will learn more in the coming\r\nchapters of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. _Gradual Initiation to the Mysteries of Slavery_\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWING ACQUAINTANCE WITH OLD MASTER—HIS CHARACTER—EVILS OF\r\nUNRESTRAINED PASSION—APPARENT TENDERNESS—OLD MASTER A MAN OF\r\nTROUBLE—CUSTOM OF MUTTERING TO HIMSELF—NECESSITY OF BEING AWARE OF HIS\r\nWORDS—THE SUPPOSED OBTUSENESS OF SLAVE-CHILDREN—BRUTAL OUTRAGE—DRUNKEN\r\nOVERSEER—SLAVEHOLDER’S IMPATIENCE—WISDOM OF APPEALING TO SUPERIORS—THE\r\nSLAVEHOLDER S WRATH BAD AS THAT OF THE OVERSEER—A BASE AND SELFISH\r\nATTEMPT TO BREAK UP A COURTSHIP—A HARROWING SCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough my old master—Capt. Anthony—gave me at first, (as the reader\r\nwill have already seen) very little attention, and although that little\r\nwas of a remarkably mild and gentle description, a few months only were\r\nsufficient to convince me that mildness and gentleness were not the\r\nprevailing or governing traits of his character. These excellent\r\nqualities were displayed only occasionally. He could, when it suited\r\nhim, appear to be literally insensible to the claims of humanity, when\r\nappealed to by the helpless against an aggressor, and he could himself\r\ncommit outrages, deep, dark and nameless. Yet he was not by nature\r\nworse than other men. Had he been brought up in a free state,\r\nsurrounded by the just restraints of free society—restraints which are\r\nnecessary to the freedom of all its members, alike and equally—Capt.\r\nAnthony might have been as humane a man, and every way as respectable,\r\nas many who now oppose the slave system; certainly as humane and\r\nrespectable as are members of society generally. The slaveholder, as\r\nwell as the slave, is the victim of the slave system. A man’s character\r\ngreatly takes its hue and shape from the form and color of things about\r\nhim. Under the whole heavens there is no relation more unfavorable to\r\nthe development of honorable character, than that sustained by the\r\nslaveholder to the slave. Reason is imprisoned here, and passions run\r\nwild. Like the fires of the prairie, once lighted, they are at the\r\nmercy of every wind, and must burn, till they have consumed all that is\r\ncombustible within their remorseless grasp. Capt. Anthony could be\r\nkind, and, at times, he even showed an affectionate disposition. Could\r\nthe reader have seen him gently leading me by the hand—as he sometimes\r\ndid—patting me on the head, speaking to me in soft, caressing tones and\r\ncalling me his “little Indian boy,” he would have deemed him a kind old\r\nman, and really, almost fatherly. But the pleasant moods of a\r\nslaveholder are remarkably brittle; they are easily snapped; they\r\nneither come often, nor remain long. His temper is subjected to\r\nperpetual trials; but, since these trials are never borne patiently,\r\nthey add nothing to his natural stock of patience.\r\n\r\nOld master very early impressed me with the idea that he was an unhappy\r\nman. Even to my child’s eye, he wore a troubled, and at times, a\r\nhaggard aspect. His strange movements excited my curiosity, and\r\nawakened my compassion. He seldom walked alone without muttering to\r\nhimself; and he occasionally stormed about, as if defying an army of\r\ninvisible foes. “He would do this, that, and the other; he’d be d—d if\r\nhe did not,”—was the usual form of his threats. Most of his leisure was\r\nspent in walking, cursing and gesticulating, like one possessed by a\r\ndemon. Most evidently, he was a wretched man, at war with his own soul,\r\nand with all the world around him. To be overheard by the children,\r\ndisturbed him very little. He made no more of our presence, than of\r\nthat of the ducks and geese which he met on the green. He little\r\nthought that the little black urchins around him, could see, through\r\nthose vocal crevices, the very secrets of his heart. Slaveholders ever\r\nunderrate the intelligence with which they have to grapple. I really\r\nunderstood the old man’s mutterings, attitudes and gestures, about as\r\nwell as he did himself. But slaveholders never encourage that kind of\r\ncommunication, with the slaves, by which they might learn to measure\r\nthe depths of his knowledge. Ignorance is a high virtue in a human\r\nchattel; and as the master studies to keep the slave ignorant, the\r\nslave is cunning enough to make the master think he succeeds. The slave\r\nfully appreciates the saying, “where ignorance is bliss, ‘tis folly to\r\nbe wise.” When old master’s gestures were violent, ending with a\r\nthreatening shake of the head, and a sharp snap of his middle finger\r\nand thumb, I deemed it wise to keep at a respectable distance from him;\r\nfor, at such times, trifling faults stood, in his eyes, as momentous\r\noffenses; and, having both the power and the disposition, the victim\r\nhad only to be near him to catch the punishment, deserved or\r\nundeserved.\r\n\r\nOne of the first circumstances that opened my eyes to the cruelty and\r\nwickedness of slavery, and the heartlessness of my old master, was the\r\nrefusal of the latter to interpose his authority, to protect and shield\r\na young woman, who had been most cruelly abused and beaten by his\r\noverseer in Tuckahoe. This overseer—a Mr. Plummer—was a man like most\r\nof his class, little better than a human brute; and, in addition to his\r\ngeneral profligacy and repulsive coarseness, the creature was a\r\nmiserable drunkard. He was, probably, employed by my old master, less\r\non account of the excellence of his services, than for the cheap rate\r\nat which they could be obtained. He was not fit to have the management\r\nof a drove of mules. In a fit of drunken madness, he committed the\r\noutrage which brought the young woman in question down to my old\r\nmaster’s for protection. This young woman was the daughter of Milly, an\r\nown aunt of mine. The poor girl, on arriving at our house, presented a\r\npitiable appearance. She had left in haste, and without preparation;\r\nand, probably, without the knowledge of Mr. Plummer. She had traveled\r\ntwelve miles, bare-footed, bare-necked and bare-headed. Her neck and\r\nshoulders were covered with scars, newly made; and not content with\r\nmarring her neck and shoulders, with the cowhide, the cowardly brute\r\nhad dealt her a blow on the head with a hickory club, which cut a\r\nhorrible gash, and left her face literally covered with blood. In this\r\ncondition, the poor young woman came down, to implore protection at the\r\nhands of my old master. I expected to see him boil over with rage at\r\nthe revolting deed, and to hear him fill the air with curses upon the\r\nbrutual Plummer; but I was disappointed. He sternly told her, in an\r\nangry tone, he “believed she deserved every bit of it,” and, if she did\r\nnot go home instantly, he would himself take the remaining skin from\r\nher neck and back. Thus was the poor girl compelled to return, without\r\nredress, and perhaps to receive an additional flogging for daring to\r\nappeal to old master against the overseer.\r\n\r\nOld master seemed furious at the thought of being troubled by such\r\ncomplaints. I did not, at that time, understand the philosophy of his\r\ntreatment of my cousin. It was stern, unnatural, violent. Had the man\r\nno bowels of compassion? Was he dead to all sense of humanity? No. I\r\nthink I now understand it. This treatment is a part of the system,\r\nrather than a part of the man. Were slaveholders to listen to\r\ncomplaints of this sort against the overseers, the luxury of owning\r\nlarge numbers of slaves, would be impossible. It would do away with the\r\noffice of overseer, entirely; or, in other words, it would convert the\r\nmaster himself into an overseer. It would occasion great loss of time\r\nand labor, leaving the overseer in fetters, and without the necessary\r\npower to secure obedience to his orders. A privilege so dangerous as\r\nthat of appeal, is, therefore, strictly prohibited; and any one\r\nexercising it, runs a fearful hazard. Nevertheless, when a slave has\r\nnerve enough to exercise it, and boldly approaches his master, with a\r\nwell-founded complaint against an overseer, though he may be repulsed,\r\nand may even have that of which he complains repeated at the time, and,\r\nthough he may be beaten by his master, as well as by the overseer, for\r\nhis temerity, in the end the policy of complaining is, generally,\r\nvindicated by the relaxed rigor of the overseer’s treatment. The latter\r\nbecomes more careful, and less disposed to use the lash upon such\r\nslaves thereafter. It is with this final result in view, rather than\r\nwith any expectation of immediate good, that the outraged slave is\r\ninduced to meet his master with a complaint. The overseer very\r\nnaturally dislikes to have the ear of the master disturbed by\r\ncomplaints; and, either upon this consideration, or upon advice and\r\nwarning privately given him by his employers, he generally modifies the\r\nrigor of his rule, after an outbreak of the kind to which I have been\r\nreferring.\r\n\r\nHowsoever the slaveholder may allow himself to act toward his slave,\r\nand, whatever cruelty he may deem it wise, for example’s sake, or for\r\nthe gratification of his humor, to inflict, he cannot, in the absence\r\nof all provocation, look with pleasure upon the bleeding wounds of a\r\ndefenseless slave-woman. When he drives her from his presence without\r\nredress, or the hope of redress, he acts, generally, from motives of\r\npolicy, rather than from a hardened nature, or from innate brutality.\r\nYet, let but his own temper be stirred, his own passions get loose, and\r\nthe slave-owner will go _far beyond_ the overseer in cruelty. He will\r\nconvince the slave that his wrath is far more terrible and boundless,\r\nand vastly more to be dreaded, than that of the underling overseer.\r\nWhat may have been mechanically and heartlessly done by the overseer,\r\nis now done with a will. The man who now wields the lash is\r\nirresponsible. He may, if he pleases, cripple or kill, without fear of\r\nconsequences; except in so far as it may concern profit or loss. To a\r\nman of violent temper—as my old master was—this was but a very slender\r\nand inefficient restraint. I have seen him in a tempest of passion,\r\nsuch as I have just described—a passion into which entered all the\r\nbitter ingredients of pride, hatred, envy, jealousy, and the\r\nthrist(sic) for revenge.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which I am about to narrate, and which gave rise to\r\nthis fearful tempest of passion, are not singular nor isolated in slave\r\nlife, but are common in every slaveholding community in which I have\r\nlived. They are incidental to the relation of master and slave, and\r\nexist in all sections of slave-holding countries.\r\n\r\nThe reader will have noticed that, in enumerating the names of the\r\nslaves who lived with my old master, _Esther_ is mentioned. This was a\r\nyoung woman who possessed that which is ever a curse to the slave-girl;\r\nnamely—personal beauty. She was tall, well formed, and made a fine\r\nappearance. The daughters of Col. Lloyd could scarcely surpass her in\r\npersonal charms. Esther was courted by Ned Roberts, and he was as fine\r\nlooking a young man, as she was a woman. He was the son of a favorite\r\nslave of Col. Lloyd. Some slaveholders would have been glad to promote\r\nthe marriage of two such persons; but, for some reason or other, my old\r\nmaster took it upon him to break up the growing intimacy between Esther\r\nand Edward. He strictly ordered her to quit the company of said\r\nRoberts, telling her that he would punish her severely if he ever found\r\nher again in Edward’s company. This unnatural and heartless order was,\r\nof course, broken. A woman’s love is not to be annihilated by the\r\nperemptory command of any one, whose breath is in his nostrils. It was\r\nimpossible to keep Edward and Esther apart. Meet they would, and meet\r\nthey did. Had old master been a man of honor and purity, his motives,\r\nin this matter, might have been viewed more favorably. As it was, his\r\nmotives were as abhorrent, as his methods were foolish and\r\ncontemptible. It was too evident that he was not concerned for the\r\ngirl’s welfare. It is one of the damning characteristics of the slave\r\nsystem, that it robs its victims of every earthly incentive to a holy\r\nlife. The fear of God, and the hope of heaven, are found sufficient to\r\nsustain many slave-women, amidst the snares and dangers of their\r\nstrange lot; but, this side of God and heaven, a slave-woman is at the\r\nmercy of the power, caprice and passion of her owner. Slavery provides\r\nno means for the honorable continuance of the race. Marriage as\r\nimposing obligations on the parties to it—has no existence here, except\r\nin such hearts as are purer and higher than the standard morality\r\naround them. It is one of the consolations of my life, that I know of\r\nmany honorable instances of persons who maintained their honor, where\r\nall around was corrupt.\r\n\r\nEsther was evidently much attached to Edward, and abhorred—as she had\r\nreason to do—the tyrannical and base behavior of old master. Edward was\r\nyoung, and fine looking, and he loved and courted her. He might have\r\nbeen her husband, in the high sense just alluded to; but WHO and _what_\r\nwas this old master? His attentions were plainly brutal and selfish,\r\nand it was as natural that Esther should loathe him, as that she should\r\nlove Edward. Abhorred and circumvented as he was, old master, having\r\nthe power, very easily took revenge. I happened to see this exhibition\r\nof his rage and cruelty toward Esther. The time selected was singular.\r\nIt was early in the morning, when all besides was still, and before any\r\nof the family, in the house or kitchen, had left their beds. I saw but\r\nfew of the shocking preliminaries, for the cruel work had begun before\r\nI awoke. I was probably awakened by the shrieks and piteous cries of\r\npoor Esther. My sleeping place was on the floor of a little, rough\r\ncloset, which opened into the kitchen; and through the cracks of its\r\nunplaned boards, I could distinctly see and hear what was going on,\r\nwithout being seen by old master. Esther’s wrists were firmly tied, and\r\nthe twisted rope was fastened to a strong staple in a heavy wooden\r\njoist above, near the fireplace. Here she stood, on a bench, her arms\r\ntightly drawn over her breast. Her back and shoulders were bare to the\r\nwaist. Behind her stood old master, with cowskin in hand, preparing his\r\nbarbarous work with all manner of harsh, coarse, and tantalizing\r\nepithets. The screams of his victim were most piercing. He was cruelly\r\ndeliberate, and protracted the torture, as one who was delighted with\r\nthe scene. Again and again he drew the hateful whip through his hand,\r\nadjusting it with a view of dealing the most pain-giving blow. Poor\r\nEsther had never yet been severely whipped, and her shoulders were\r\nplump and tender. Each blow, vigorously laid on, brought screams as\r\nwell as blood. _“Have mercy; Oh! have mercy”_ she cried; “_I won’t do\r\nso no more;”_ but her piercing cries seemed only to increase his fury.\r\nHis answers to them are too coarse and blasphemous to be produced here.\r\nThe whole scene, with all its attendants, was revolting and shocking,\r\nto the last degree; and when the motives of this brutal castigation are\r\nconsidered,—language has no power to convey a just sense of its awful\r\ncriminality. After laying on some thirty or forty stripes, old master\r\nuntied his suffering victim, and let her get down. She could scarcely\r\nstand, when untied. From my heart I pitied her, and—child though I\r\nwas—the outrage kindled in me a feeling far from peaceful; but I was\r\nhushed, terrified, stunned, and could do nothing, and the fate of\r\nEsther might be mine next. The scene here described was often repeated\r\nin the case of poor Esther, and her life, as I knew it, was one of\r\nwretchedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. _Treatment of Slaves on Lloyd’s Plantation_\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY REFLECTIONS ON SLAVERY—PRESENTIMENT OF ONE DAY BEING A\r\nFREEMAN—COMBAT BETWEEN AN OVERSEER AND A SLAVEWOMAN—THE ADVANTAGES OF\r\nRESISTANCE—ALLOWANCE DAY ON THE HOME PLANTATION—THE SINGING OF\r\nSLAVES—AN EXPLANATION—THE SLAVES FOOD AND CLOTHING—NAKED CHILDREN—LIFE\r\nIN THE QUARTER—DEPRIVATION OF SLEEP—NURSING CHILDREN CARRIED TO THE\r\nFIELD—DESCRIPTION OF THE COWSKIN—THE ASH-CAKE—MANNER OF MAKING IT—THE\r\nDINNER HOUR—THE CONTRAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heart-rending incidents, related in the foregoing chapter, led me,\r\nthus early, to inquire into the nature and history of slavery. _Why am\r\nI a slave? Why are some people slaves, and others masters? Was there\r\never a time this was not so? How did the relation commence?_ These were\r\nthe perplexing questions which began now to claim my thoughts, and to\r\nexercise the weak powers of my mind, for I was still but a child, and\r\nknew less than children of the same age in the free states. As my\r\nquestions concerning these things were only put to children a little\r\nolder, and little better informed than myself, I was not rapid in\r\nreaching a solid footing. By some means I learned from these inquiries\r\nthat _“God, up in the sky,”_ made every body; and that he made _white_\r\npeople to be masters and mistresses, and _black_ people to be slaves.\r\nThis did not satisfy me, nor lessen my interest in the subject. I was\r\ntold, too, that God was good, and that He knew what was best for me,\r\nand best for everybody. This was less satisfactory than the first\r\nstatement; because it came, point blank, against all my notions of\r\ngoodness. It was not good to let old master cut the flesh off Esther,\r\nand make her cry so. Besides, how did people know that God made black\r\npeople to be slaves? Did they go up in the sky and learn it? or, did He\r\ncome down and tell them so? All was dark here. It was some relief to my\r\nhard notions of the goodness of God, that, although he made white men\r\nto be slaveholders, he did not make them to be _bad_ slaveholders, and\r\nthat, in due time, he would punish the bad slaveholders; that he would,\r\nwhen they died, send them to the bad place, where they would be “burnt\r\nup.” Nevertheless, I could not reconcile the relation of slavery with\r\nmy crude notions of goodness.\r\n\r\nThen, too, I found that there were puzzling exceptions to this theory\r\nof slavery on both sides, and in the middle. I knew of blacks who were\r\n_not_ slaves; I knew of whites who were _not_ slaveholders; and I knew\r\nof persons who were _nearly_ white, who were slaves. _Color_,\r\ntherefore, was a very unsatisfactory basis for slavery.\r\n\r\nOnce, however, engaged in the inquiry, I was not very long in finding\r\nout the true solution of the matter. It was not _color_, but _crime_,\r\nnot _God_, but _man_, that afforded the true explanation of the\r\nexistence of slavery; nor was I long in finding out another important\r\ntruth, viz: what man can make, man can unmake. The appalling darkness\r\nfaded away, and I was master of the subject. There were slaves here,\r\ndirect from Guinea; and there were many who could say that their\r\nfathers and mothers were stolen from Africa—forced from their homes,\r\nand compelled to serve as slaves. This, to me, was knowledge; but it\r\nwas a kind of knowledge which filled me with a burning hatred of\r\nslavery, increased my suffering, and left me without the means of\r\nbreaking away from my bondage. Yet it was knowledge quite worth\r\npossessing. I could not have been more than seven or eight years old,\r\nwhen I began to make this subject my study. It was with me in the woods\r\nand fields; along the shore of the river, and wherever my boyish\r\nwanderings led me; and though I was, at that time, quite ignorant of\r\nthe existence of the free states, I distinctly remember being, _even\r\nthen_, most strongly impressed with the idea of being a freeman some\r\nday. This cheering assurance was an inborn dream of my human nature a\r\nconstant menace to slavery—and one which all the powers of slavery were\r\nunable to silence or extinguish.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the brutal flogging of my Aunt Esther—for she was my\r\nown aunt—and the horrid plight in which I had seen my cousin from\r\nTuckahoe, who had been so badly beaten by the cruel Mr. Plummer, my\r\nattention had not been called, especially, to the gross features of\r\nslavery. I had, of course, heard of whippings and of savage\r\n_rencontres_ between overseers and slaves, but I had always been out of\r\nthe way at the times and places of their occurrence. My plays and\r\nsports, most of the time, took me from the corn and tobacco fields,\r\nwhere the great body of the hands were at work, and where scenes of\r\ncruelty were enacted and witnessed. But, after the whipping of Aunt\r\nEsther, I saw many cases of the same shocking nature, not only in my\r\nmaster’s house, but on Col. Lloyd’s plantation. One of the first which\r\nI saw, and which greatly agitated me, was the whipping of a woman\r\nbelonging to Col. Lloyd, named Nelly. The offense alleged against\r\nNelly, was one of the commonest and most indefinite in the whole\r\ncatalogue of offenses usually laid to the charge of slaves, viz:\r\n“impudence.” This may mean almost anything, or nothing at all, just\r\naccording to the caprice of the master or overseer, at the moment. But,\r\nwhatever it is, or is not, if it gets the name of “impudence,” the\r\nparty charged with it is sure of a flogging. This offense may be\r\ncommitted in various ways; in the tone of an answer; in answering at\r\nall; in not answering; in the expression of countenance; in the motion\r\nof the head; in the gait, manner and bearing of the slave. In the case\r\nunder consideration, I can easily believe that, according to all\r\nslaveholding standards, here was a genuine instance of impudence. In\r\nNelly there were all the necessary conditions for committing the\r\noffense. She was a bright mulatto, the recognized wife of a favorite\r\n“hand” on board Col. Lloyd’s sloop, and the mother of five sprightly\r\nchildren. She was a vigorous and spirited woman, and one of the most\r\nlikely, on the plantation, to be guilty of impudence. My attention was\r\ncalled to the scene, by the noise, curses and screams that proceeded\r\nfrom it; and, on going a little in that direction, I came upon the\r\nparties engaged in the skirmish. Mr. Siever, the overseer, had hold of\r\nNelly, when I caught sight of them; he was endeavoring to drag her\r\ntoward a tree, which endeavor Nelly was sternly resisting; but to no\r\npurpose, except to retard the progress of the overseer’s plans.\r\nNelly—as I have said—was the mother of five children; three of them\r\nwere present, and though quite small (from seven to ten years old, I\r\nshould think) they gallantly came to their mother’s defense, and gave\r\nthe overseer an excellent pelting with stones. One of the little\r\nfellows ran up, seized the overseer by the leg and bit him; but the\r\nmonster was too busily engaged with Nelly, to pay any attention to the\r\nassaults of the children. There were numerous bloody marks on Mr.\r\nSevier’s face, when I first saw him, and they increased as the struggle\r\nwent on. The imprints of Nelly’s fingers were visible, and I was glad\r\nto see them. Amidst the wild screams of the children—“_Let my mammy\r\ngo”—“let my mammy go_”—there escaped, from between the teeth of the\r\nbullet-headed overseer, a few bitter curses, mingled with threats, that\r\n“he would teach the d—d b—h how to give a white man impudence.” There\r\nis no doubt that Nelly felt herself superior, in some respects, to the\r\nslaves around her. She was a wife and a mother; her husband was a\r\nvalued and favorite slave. Besides, he was one of the first hands on\r\nboard of the sloop, and the sloop hands—since they had to represent the\r\nplantation abroad—were generally treated tenderly. The overseer never\r\nwas allowed to whip Harry; why then should he be allowed to whip\r\nHarry’s wife? Thoughts of this kind, no doubt, influenced her; but, for\r\nwhatever reason, she nobly resisted, and, unlike most of the slaves,\r\nseemed determined to make her whipping cost Mr. Sevier as much as\r\npossible. The blood on his (and her) face, attested her skill, as well\r\nas her courage and dexterity in using her nails. Maddened by her\r\nresistance, I expected to see Mr. Sevier level her to the ground by a\r\nstunning blow; but no; like a savage bull-dog—which he resembled both\r\nin temper and appearance—he maintained his grip, and steadily dragged\r\nhis victim toward the tree, disregarding alike her blows, and the cries\r\nof the children for their mother’s release. He would, doubtless, have\r\nknocked her down with his hickory stick, but that such act might have\r\ncost him his place. It is often deemed advisable to knock a _man_ slave\r\ndown, in order to tie him, but it is considered cowardly and\r\ninexcusable, in an overseer, thus to deal with a _woman_. He is\r\nexpected to tie her up, and to give her what is called, in southern\r\nparlance, a “genteel flogging,” without any very great outlay of\r\nstrength or skill. I watched, with palpitating interest, the course of\r\nthe preliminary struggle, and was saddened by every new advantage\r\ngained over her by the ruffian. There were times when she seemed likely\r\nto get the better of the brute, but he finally overpowered her, and\r\nsucceeded in getting his rope around her arms, and in firmly tying her\r\nto the tree, at which he had been aiming. This done, and Nelly was at\r\nthe mercy of his merciless lash; and now, what followed, I have no\r\nheart to describe. The cowardly creature made good his every threat;\r\nand wielded the lash with all the hot zest of furious revenge. The\r\ncries of the woman, while undergoing the terrible infliction, were\r\nmingled with those of the children, sounds which I hope the reader may\r\nnever be called upon to hear. When Nelly was untied, her back was\r\ncovered with blood. The red stripes were all over her shoulders. She\r\nwas whipped—severely whipped; but she was not subdued, for she\r\ncontinued to denounce the overseer, and to call him every vile name. He\r\nhad bruised her flesh, but had left her invincible spirit undaunted.\r\nSuch floggings are seldom repeated by the same overseer. They prefer to\r\nwhip those who are most easily whipped. The old doctrine that\r\nsubmission is the very best cure for outrage and wrong, does not hold\r\ngood on the slave plantation. He is whipped oftenest, who is whipped\r\neasiest; and that slave who has the courage to stand up for himself\r\nagainst the overseer, although he may have many hard stripes at the\r\nfirst, becomes, in the end, a freeman, even though he sustain the\r\nformal relation of a slave. “You can shoot me but you can’t whip me,”\r\nsaid a slave to Rigby Hopkins; and the result was that he was neither\r\nwhipped nor shot. If the latter had been his fate, it would have been\r\nless deplorable than the living and lingering death to which cowardly\r\nand slavish souls are subjected. I do not know that Mr. Sevier ever\r\nundertook to whip Nelly again. He probably never did, for it was not\r\nlong after his attempt to subdue her, that he was taken sick, and died.\r\nThe wretched man died as he had lived, unrepentant; and it was\r\nsaid—with how much truth I know not—that in the very last hours of his\r\nlife, his ruling passion showed itself, and that when wrestling with\r\ndeath, he was uttering horrid oaths, and flourishing the cowskin, as\r\nthough he was tearing the flesh off some helpless slave. One thing is\r\ncertain, that when he was in health, it was enough to chill the blood,\r\nand to stiffen the hair of an ordinary man, to hear Mr. Sevier talk.\r\nNature, or his cruel habits, had given to his face an expression of\r\nunusual savageness, even for a slave-driver. Tobacco and rage had worn\r\nhis teeth short, and nearly every sentence that escaped their\r\ncompressed grating, was commenced or concluded with some outburst of\r\nprofanity. His presence made the field alike the field of blood, and of\r\nblasphemy. Hated for his cruelty, despised for his cowardice, his death\r\nwas deplored by no one outside his own house—if indeed it was deplored\r\nthere; it was regarded by the slaves as a merciful interposition of\r\nProvidence. Never went there a man to the grave loaded with heavier\r\ncurses. Mr. Sevier’s place was promptly taken by a Mr. Hopkins, and the\r\nchange was quite a relief, he being a very different man. He was, in\r\nall respects, a better man than his predecessor; as good as any man can\r\nbe, and yet be an overseer. His course was characterized by no\r\nextraordinary cruelty; and when he whipped a slave, as he sometimes\r\ndid, he seemed to take no especial pleasure in it, but, on the\r\ncontrary, acted as though he felt it to be a mean business. Mr. Hopkins\r\nstayed but a short time; his place much to the regret of the slaves\r\ngenerally—was taken by a Mr. Gore, of whom more will be said hereafter.\r\nIt is enough, for the present, to say, that he was no improvement on\r\nMr. Sevier, except that he was less noisy and less profane.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the business-like aspect of Col. Lloyd’s\r\nplantation. This business-like appearance was much increased on the two\r\ndays at the end of each month, when the slaves from the different farms\r\ncame to get their monthly allowance of meal and meat. These were gala\r\ndays for the slaves, and there was much rivalry among them as to _who_\r\nshould be elected to go up to the great house farm for the allowance,\r\nand, indeed, to attend to any business at this (for them) the capital.\r\nThe beauty and grandeur of the place, its numerous slave population,\r\nand the fact that Harry, Peter and Jake the sailors of the sloop—almost\r\nalways kept, privately, little trinkets which they bought at Baltimore,\r\nto sell, made it a privilege to come to the great house farm. Being\r\nselected, too, for this office, was deemed a high honor. It was taken\r\nas a proof of confidence and favor; but, probably, the chief motive of\r\nthe competitors for the place, was, a desire to break the dull monotony\r\nof the field, and to get beyond the overseer’s eye and lash. Once on\r\nthe road with an ox team, and seated on the tongue of his cart, with no\r\noverseer to look after him, the slave was comparatively free; and, if\r\nthoughtful, he had time to think. Slaves are generally expected to sing\r\nas well as to work. A silent slave is not liked by masters or\r\noverseers. _“Make a noise,” “make a noise,”_ and _“bear a hand,”_ are\r\nthe words usually addressed to the slaves when there is silence amongst\r\nthem. This may account for the almost constant singing heard in the\r\nsouthern states. There was, generally, more or less singing among the\r\nteamsters, as it was one means of letting the overseer know where they\r\nwere, and that they were moving on with the work. But, on allowance\r\nday, those who visited the great house farm were peculiarly excited and\r\nnoisy. While on their way, they would make the dense old woods, for\r\nmiles around, reverberate with their wild notes. These were not always\r\nmerry because they were wild. On the contrary, they were mostly of a\r\nplaintive cast, and told a tale of grief and sorrow. In the most\r\nboisterous outbursts of rapturous sentiment, there was ever a tinge of\r\ndeep melancholy. I have never heard any songs like those anywhere since\r\nI left slavery, except when in Ireland. There I heard the same _wailing\r\nnotes_, and was much affected by them. It was during the famine of\r\n1845-6. In all the songs of the slaves, there was ever some expression\r\nin praise of the great house farm; something which would flatter the\r\npride of the owner, and, possibly, draw a favorable glance from him.\r\n\r\nI am going away to the great house farm,\r\nO yea!  O yea!  O yea!\r\nMy old master is a good old master,\r\nO yea!  O yea!  O yea!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis they would sing, with other words of their own improvising—jargon\r\nto others, but full of meaning to themselves. I have sometimes thought,\r\nthat the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress truly\r\nspiritual-minded men and women with the soul-crushing and death-dealing\r\ncharacter of slavery, than the reading of whole volumes of its mere\r\nphysical cruelties. They speak to the heart and to the soul of the\r\nthoughtful. I cannot better express my sense of them now, than ten\r\nyears ago, when, in sketching my life, I thus spoke of this feature of\r\nmy plantation experience:\r\n\r\nI did not, when a slave, understand the deep meanings of those rude,\r\nand apparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle, so\r\nthat I neither saw or heard as those without might see and hear. They\r\ntold a tale which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension;\r\nthey were tones, loud, long and deep, breathing the prayer and\r\ncomplaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone\r\nwas a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance\r\nfrom chains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my\r\nspirits, and filled my heart with ineffable sadness. The mere\r\nrecurrence, even now, afflicts my spirit, and while I am writing these\r\nlines, my tears are falling. To those songs I trace my first glimmering\r\nconceptions of the dehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get\r\nrid of that conception. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my\r\nhatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds.\r\nIf any one wishes to be impressed with a sense of the soul-killing\r\npower of slavery, let him go to Col. Lloyd’s plantation, and, on\r\nallowance day, place himself in the deep, pine woods, and there let\r\nhim, in silence, thoughtfully analyze the sounds that shall pass\r\nthrough the chambers of his soul, and if he is not thus impressed, it\r\nwill only be because “there is no flesh in his obdurate heart.”\r\n\r\nThe remark is not unfrequently made, that slaves are the most contended\r\nand happy laborers in the world. They dance and sing, and make all\r\nmanner of joyful noises—so they do; but it is a great mistake to\r\nsuppose them happy because they sing. The songs of the slave represent\r\nthe sorrows, rather than the joys, of his heart; and he is relieved by\r\nthem, only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears. Such is the\r\nconstitution of the human mind, that, when pressed to extremes, it\r\noften avails itself of the most opposite methods. Extremes meet in mind\r\nas in matter. When the slaves on board of the “Pearl” were overtaken,\r\narrested, and carried to prison—their hopes for freedom blasted—as they\r\nmarched in chains they sang, and found (as Emily Edmunson tells us) a\r\nmelancholy relief in singing. The singing of a man cast away on a\r\ndesolate island, might be as appropriately considered an evidence of\r\nhis contentment and happiness, as the singing of a slave. Sorrow and\r\ndesolation have their songs, as well as joy and peace. Slaves sing more\r\nto _make_ themselves happy, than to express their happiness.\r\n\r\nIt is the boast of slaveholders, that their slaves enjoy more of the\r\nphysical comforts of life than the peasantry of any country in the\r\nworld. My experience contradicts this. The men and the women slaves on\r\nCol. Lloyd’s farm, received, as their monthly allowance of food, eight\r\npounds of pickled pork, or their equivalent in fish. The pork was often\r\ntainted, and the fish was of the poorest quality—herrings, which would\r\nbring very little if offered for sale in any northern market. With\r\ntheir pork or fish, they had one bushel of Indian meal—unbolted—of\r\nwhich quite fifteen per cent was fit only to feed pigs. With this, one\r\npint of salt was given; and this was the entire monthly allowance of a\r\nfull grown slave, working constantly in the open field, from morning\r\nuntil night, every day in the month except Sunday, and living on a\r\nfraction more than a quarter of a pound of meat per day, and less than\r\na peck of corn-meal per week. There is no kind of work that a man can\r\ndo which requires a better supply of food to prevent physical\r\nexhaustion, than the field-work of a slave. So much for the slave’s\r\nallowance of food; now for his raiment. The yearly allowance of\r\nclothing for the slaves on this plantation, consisted of two tow-linen\r\nshirts—such linen as the coarsest crash towels are made of; one pair of\r\ntrowsers of the same material, for summer, and a pair of trowsers and a\r\njacket of woolen, most slazily put together, for winter; one pair of\r\nyarn stockings, and one pair of shoes of the coarsest description. The\r\nslave’s entire apparel could not have cost more than eight dollars per\r\nyear. The allowance of food and clothing for the little children, was\r\ncommitted to their mothers, or to the older slavewomen having the care\r\nof them. Children who were unable to work in the field, had neither\r\nshoes, stockings, jackets nor trowsers given them. Their clothing\r\nconsisted of two coarse tow-linen shirts—already described—per year;\r\nand when these failed them, as they often did, they went naked until\r\nthe next allowance day. Flocks of little children from five to ten\r\nyears old, might be seen on Col. Lloyd’s plantation, as destitute of\r\nclothing as any little heathen on the west coast of Africa; and this,\r\nnot merely during the summer months, but during the frosty weather of\r\nMarch. The little girls were no better off than the boys; all were\r\nnearly in a state of nudity.\r\n\r\nAs to beds to sleep on, they were known to none of the field hands;\r\nnothing but a coarse blanket—not so good as those used in the north to\r\ncover horses—was given them, and this only to the men and women. The\r\nchildren stuck themselves in holes and corners, about the quarters;\r\noften in the corner of the huge chimneys, with their feet in the ashes\r\nto keep them warm. The want of beds, however, was not considered a very\r\ngreat privation. Time to sleep was of far greater importance, for, when\r\nthe day’s work is done, most of the slaves have their washing, mending\r\nand cooking to do; and, having few or none of the ordinary facilities\r\nfor doing such things, very many of their sleeping hours are consumed\r\nin necessary preparations for the duties of the coming day.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping apartments—if they may be called such—have little regard\r\nto comfort or decency. Old and young, male and female, married and\r\nsingle, drop down upon the common clay floor, each covering up with his\r\nor her blanket,—the only protection they have from cold or exposure.\r\nThe night, however, is shortened at both ends. The slaves work often as\r\nlong as they can see, and are late in cooking and mending for the\r\ncoming day; and, at the first gray streak of morning, they are summoned\r\nto the field by the driver’s horn.\r\n\r\nMore slaves are whipped for oversleeping than for any other fault.\r\nNeither age nor sex finds any favor. The overseer stands at the quarter\r\ndoor, armed with stick and cowskin, ready to whip any who may be a few\r\nminutes behind time. When the horn is blown, there is a rush for the\r\ndoor, and the hindermost one is sure to get a blow from the overseer.\r\nYoung mothers who worked in the field, were allowed an hour, about ten\r\no’clock in the morning, to go home to nurse their children. Sometimes\r\nthey were compelled to take their children with them, and to leave them\r\nin the corner of the fences, to prevent loss of time in nursing them.\r\nThe overseer generally rides about the field on horseback. A cowskin\r\nand a hickory stick are his constant companions. The cowskin is a kind\r\nof whip seldom seen in the northern states. It is made entirely of\r\nuntanned, but dried, ox hide, and is about as hard as a piece of\r\nwell-seasoned live oak. It is made of various sizes, but the usual\r\nlength is about three feet. The part held in the hand is nearly an inch\r\nin thickness; and, from the extreme end of the butt or handle, the\r\ncowskin tapers its whole length to a point. This makes it quite elastic\r\nand springy. A blow with it, on the hardest back, will gash the flesh,\r\nand make the blood start. Cowskins are painted red, blue and green, and\r\nare the favorite slave whip. I think this whip worse than the\r\n“cat-o’nine-tails.” It condenses the whole strength of the arm to a\r\nsingle point, and comes with a spring that makes the air whistle. It is\r\na terrible instrument, and is so handy, that the overseer can always\r\nhave it on his person, and ready for use. The temptation to use it is\r\never strong; and an overseer can, if disposed, always have cause for\r\nusing it. With him, it is literally a word and a blow, and, in most\r\ncases, the blow comes first.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, slaves do not come to the quarters for either\r\nbreakfast or dinner, but take their “ash cake” with them, and eat it in\r\nthe field. This was so on the home plantation; probably, because the\r\ndistance from the quarter to the field, was sometimes two, and even\r\nthree miles.\r\n\r\nThe dinner of the slaves consisted of a huge piece of ash cake, and a\r\nsmall piece of pork, or two salt herrings. Not having ovens, nor any\r\nsuitable cooking utensils, the slaves mixed their meal with a little\r\nwater, to such thickness that a spoon would stand erect in it; and,\r\nafter the wood had burned away to coals and ashes, they would place the\r\ndough between oak leaves and lay it carefully in the ashes, completely\r\ncovering it; hence, the bread is called ash cake. The surface of this\r\npeculiar bread is covered with ashes, to the depth of a sixteenth part\r\nof an inch, and the ashes, certainly, do not make it very grateful to\r\nthe teeth, nor render it very palatable. The bran, or coarse part of\r\nthe meal, is baked with the fine, and bright scales run through the\r\nbread. This bread, with its ashes and bran, would disgust and choke a\r\nnorthern man, but it is quite liked by the slaves. They eat it with\r\navidity, and are more concerned about the quantity than about the\r\nquality. They are far too scantily provided for, and are worked too\r\nsteadily, to be much concerned for the quality of their food. The few\r\nminutes allowed them at dinner time, after partaking of their coarse\r\nrepast, are variously spent. Some lie down on the “turning row,” and go\r\nto sleep; others draw together, and talk; and others are at work with\r\nneedle and thread, mending their tattered garments. Sometimes you may\r\nhear a wild, hoarse laugh arise from a circle, and often a song. Soon,\r\nhowever, the overseer comes dashing through the field. _“Tumble up!\r\nTumble up_, and to _work, work,”_ is the cry; and, now, from twelve\r\no’clock (mid-day) till dark, the human cattle are in motion, wielding\r\ntheir clumsy hoes; hurried on by no hope of reward, no sense of\r\ngratitude, no love of children, no prospect of bettering their\r\ncondition; nothing, save the dread and terror of the slave-driver’s\r\nlash. So goes one day, and so comes and goes another.\r\n\r\nBut, let us now leave the rough usage of the field, where vulgar\r\ncoarseness and brutal cruelty spread themselves and flourish, rank as\r\nweeds in the tropics; where a vile wretch, in the shape of a man,\r\nrides, walks, or struts about, dealing blows, and leaving gashes on\r\nbroken-spirited men and helpless women, for thirty dollars per month—a\r\nbusiness so horrible, hardening and disgraceful, that, rather, than\r\nengage in it, a decent man would blow his own brains out—and let the\r\nreader view with me the equally wicked, but less repulsive aspects of\r\nslave life; where pride and pomp roll luxuriously at ease; where the\r\ntoil of a thousand men supports a single family in easy idleness and\r\nsin. This is the great house; it is the home of the LLOYDS! Some idea\r\nof its splendor has already been given—and, it is here that we shall\r\nfind that height of luxury which is the opposite of that depth of\r\npoverty and physical wretchedness that we have just now been\r\ncontemplating. But, there is this difference in the two extremes; viz:\r\nthat in the case of the slave, the miseries and hardships of his lot\r\nare imposed by others, and, in the master’s case, they are imposed by\r\nhimself. The slave is a subject, subjected by others; the slaveholder\r\nis a subject, but he is the author of his own subjection. There is more\r\ntruth in the saying, that slavery is a greater evil to the master than\r\nto the slave, than many, who utter it, suppose. The self-executing laws\r\nof eternal justice follow close on the heels of the evil-doer here, as\r\nwell as elsewhere; making escape from all its penalties impossible.\r\nBut, let others philosophize; it is my province here to relate and\r\ndescribe; only allowing myself a word or two, occasionally, to assist\r\nthe reader in the proper understanding of the facts narrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. _Life in the Great House_\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMFORTS AND LUXURIES—ELABORATE EXPENDITURE—HOUSE SERVANTS—MEN SERVANTS\r\nAND MAID SERVANTS—APPEARANCES—SLAVE ARISTOCRACY—STABLE AND CARRIAGE\r\nHOUSE—BOUNDLESS HOSPITALITY—FRAGRANCE OF RICH DISHES—THE DECEPTIVE\r\nCHARACTER OF SLAVERY—SLAVES SEEM HAPPY—SLAVES AND SLAVEHOLDERS ALIKE\r\nWRETCHED—FRETFUL DISCONTENT OF SLAVEHOLDERS—FAULT-FINDING—OLD\r\nBARNEY—HIS PROFESSION—WHIPPING—HUMILIATING SPECTACLE—CASE\r\nEXCEPTIONAL—WILLIAM WILKS—SUPPOSED SON OF COL. LLOYD—CURIOUS\r\nINCIDENT—SLAVES PREFER RICH MASTERS TO POOR ONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe close-fisted stinginess that fed the poor slave on coarse corn-meal\r\nand tainted meat; that clothed him in crashy tow-linen, and hurried him\r\nto toil through the field, in all weathers, with wind and rain beating\r\nthrough his tattered garments; that scarcely gave even the young\r\nslave-mother time to nurse her hungry infant in the fence corner;\r\nwholly vanishes on approaching the sacred precincts of the great house,\r\nthe home of the Lloyds. There the scriptural phrase finds an exact\r\nillustration; the highly favored inmates of this mansion are literally\r\narrayed “in purple and fine linen,” and fare sumptuously every day! The\r\ntable groans under the heavy and blood-bought luxuries gathered with\r\npainstaking care, at home and abroad. Fields, forests, rivers and seas,\r\nare made tributary here. Immense wealth, and its lavish expenditure,\r\nfill the great house with all that can please the eye, or tempt the\r\ntaste. Here, appetite, not food, is the great _desideratum_. Fish,\r\nflesh and fowl, are here in profusion. Chickens, of all breeds; ducks,\r\nof all kinds, wild and tame, the common, and the huge Muscovite; Guinea\r\nfowls, turkeys, geese, and pea fowls, are in their several pens, fat\r\nand fatting for the destined vortex. The graceful swan, the mongrels,\r\nthe black-necked wild goose; partridges, quails, pheasants and pigeons;\r\nchoice water fowl, with all their strange varieties, are caught in this\r\nhuge family net. Beef, veal, mutton and venison, of the most select\r\nkinds and quality, roll bounteously to this grand consumer. The teeming\r\nriches of the Chesapeake bay, its rock, perch, drums, crocus, trout,\r\noysters, crabs, and terrapin, are drawn hither to adorn the glittering\r\ntable of the great house. The dairy, too, probably the finest on the\r\nEastern Shore of Maryland—supplied by cattle of the best English stock,\r\nimported for the purpose, pours its rich donations of fragant cheese,\r\ngolden butter, and delicious cream, to heighten the attraction of the\r\ngorgeous, unending round of feasting. Nor are the fruits of the earth\r\nforgotten or neglected. The fertile garden, many acres in size,\r\nconstituting a separate establishment, distinct from the common\r\nfarm—with its scientific gardener, imported from Scotland (a Mr.\r\nMcDermott) with four men under his direction, was not behind, either in\r\nthe abundance or in the delicacy of its contributions to the same full\r\nboard. The tender asparagus, the succulent celery, and the delicate\r\ncauliflower; egg plants, beets, lettuce, parsnips, peas, and French\r\nbeans, early and late; radishes, cantelopes, melons of all kinds; the\r\nfruits and flowers of all climes and of all descriptions, from the\r\nhardy apple of the north, to the lemon and orange of the south,\r\nculminated at this point. Baltimore gathered figs, raisins, almonds and\r\njuicy grapes from Spain. Wines and brandies from France; teas of\r\nvarious flavor, from China; and rich, aromatic coffee from Java, all\r\nconspired to swell the tide of high life, where pride and indolence\r\nrolled and lounged in magnificence and satiety.\r\n\r\nBehind the tall-backed and elaborately wrought chairs, stand the\r\nservants, men and maidens—fifteen in number—discriminately selected,\r\nnot only with a view to their industry and faithfulness, but with\r\nspecial regard to their personal appearance, their graceful agility and\r\ncaptivating address. Some of these are armed with fans, and are fanning\r\nreviving breezes toward the over-heated brows of the alabaster ladies;\r\nothers watch with eager eye, and with fawn-like step anticipate and\r\nsupply wants before they are sufficiently formed to be announced by\r\nword or sign.\r\n\r\nThese servants constituted a sort of black aristocracy on Col. Lloyd’s\r\nplantation. They resembled the field hands in nothing, except in color,\r\nand in this they held the advantage of a velvet-like glossiness, rich\r\nand beautiful. The hair, too, showed the same advantage. The delicate\r\ncolored maid rustled in the scarcely worn silk of her young mistress,\r\nwhile the servant men were equally well attired from the over-flowing\r\nwardrobe of their young masters; so that, in dress, as well as in form\r\nand feature, in manner and speech, in tastes and habits, the distance\r\nbetween these favored few, and the sorrow and hunger-smitten multitudes\r\nof the quarter and the field, was immense; and this is seldom passed\r\nover.\r\n\r\nLet us now glance at the stables and the carriage house, and we shall\r\nfind the same evidences of pride and luxurious extravagance. Here are\r\nthree splendid coaches, soft within and lustrous without. Here, too,\r\nare gigs, phaetons, barouches, sulkeys and sleighs. Here are saddles\r\nand harnesses—beautifully wrought and silver mounted—kept with every\r\ncare. In the stable you will find, kept only for pleasure, full\r\nthirty-five horses, of the most approved blood for speed and beauty.\r\nThere are two men here constantly employed in taking care of these\r\nhorses. One of these men must be always in the stable, to answer every\r\ncall from the great house. Over the way from the stable, is a house\r\nbuilt expressly for the hounds—a pack of twenty-five or thirty—whose\r\nfare would have made glad the heart of a dozen slaves. Horses and\r\nhounds are not the only consumers of the slave’s toil. There was\r\npracticed, at the Lloyd’s, a hospitality which would have astonished\r\nand charmed any health-seeking northern divine or merchant, who might\r\nhave chanced to share it. Viewed from his own table, and _not_ from the\r\nfield, the colonel was a model of generous hospitality. His house was,\r\nliterally, a hotel, for weeks during the summer months. At these times,\r\nespecially, the air was freighted with the rich fumes of baking,\r\nboiling, roasting and broiling. The odors I shared with the winds; but\r\nthe meats were under a more stringent monopoly except that,\r\noccasionally, I got a cake from Mas’ Daniel. In Mas’ Daniel I had a\r\nfriend at court, from whom I learned many things which my eager\r\ncuriosity was excited to know. I always knew when company was expected,\r\nand who they were, although I was an outsider, being the property, not\r\nof Col. Lloyd, but of a servant of the wealthy colonel. On these\r\noccasions, all that pride, taste and money could do, to dazzle and\r\ncharm, was done.\r\n\r\nWho could say that the servants of Col. Lloyd were not well clad and\r\ncared for, after witnessing one of his magnificent entertainments? Who\r\ncould say that they did not seem to glory in being the slaves of such a\r\nmaster? Who, but a fanatic, could get up any sympathy for persons whose\r\nevery movement was agile, easy and graceful, and who evinced a\r\nconsciousness of high superiority? And who would ever venture to\r\nsuspect that Col. Lloyd was subject to the troubles of ordinary\r\nmortals? Master and slave seem alike in their glory here? Can it all be\r\nseeming? Alas! it may only be a sham at last! This immense wealth; this\r\ngilded splendor; this profusion of luxury; this exemption from toil;\r\nthis life of ease; this sea of plenty; aye, what of it all? Are the\r\npearly gates of happiness and sweet content flung open to such suitors?\r\n_far from it!_ The poor slave, on his hard, pine plank, but scantily\r\ncovered with his thin blanket, sleeps more soundly than the feverish\r\nvoluptuary who reclines upon his feather bed and downy pillow. Food, to\r\nthe indolent lounger, is poison, not sustenance. Lurking beneath all\r\ntheir dishes, are invisible spirits of evil, ready to feed the\r\nself-deluded gormandizers which aches, pains, fierce temper,\r\nuncontrolled passions, dyspepsia, rheumatism, lumbago and gout; and of\r\nthese the Lloyds got their full share. To the pampered love of ease,\r\nthere is no resting place. What is pleasant today, is repulsive\r\ntomorrow; what is soft now, is hard at another time; what is sweet in\r\nthe morning, is bitter in the evening. Neither to the wicked, nor to\r\nthe idler, is there any solid peace: _“Troubled, like the restless\r\nsea.”_\r\n\r\nI had excellent opportunities of witnessing the restless discontent and\r\nthe capricious irritation of the Lloyds. My fondness for horses—not\r\npeculiar to me more than to other boys attracted me, much of the time,\r\nto the stables. This establishment was especially under the care of\r\n“old” and “young” Barney—father and son. Old Barney was a fine looking\r\nold man, of a brownish complexion, who was quite portly, and wore a\r\ndignified aspect for a slave. He was, evidently, much devoted to his\r\nprofession, and held his office an honorable one. He was a farrier as\r\nwell as an ostler; he could bleed, remove lampers from the mouths of\r\nthe horses, and was well instructed in horse medicines. No one on the\r\nfarm knew, so well as Old Barney, what to do with a sick horse. But his\r\ngifts and acquirements were of little advantage to him. His office was\r\nby no means an enviable one. He often got presents, but he got stripes\r\nas well; for in nothing was Col. Lloyd more unreasonable and exacting,\r\nthan in respect to the management of his pleasure horses. Any supposed\r\ninattention to these animals were sure to be visited with degrading\r\npunishment. His horses and dogs fared better than his men. Their beds\r\nmust be softer and cleaner than those of his human cattle. No excuse\r\ncould shield Old Barney, if the colonel only suspected something wrong\r\nabout his horses; and, consequently, he was often punished when\r\nfaultless. It was absolutely painful to listen to the many unreasonable\r\nand fretful scoldings, poured out at the stable, by Col. Lloyd, his\r\nsons and sons-in-law. Of the latter, he had three—Messrs. Nicholson,\r\nWinder and Lownes. These all lived at the great house a portion of the\r\nyear, and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they\r\npleased, which was by no means unfrequently. A horse was seldom brought\r\nout of the stable to which no objection could be raised. “There was\r\ndust in his hair;” “there was a twist in his reins;” “his mane did not\r\nlie straight;” “he had not been properly grained;” “his head did not\r\nlook well;” “his fore-top was not combed out;” “his fetlocks had not\r\nbeen properly trimmed;” something was always wrong. Listening to\r\ncomplaints, however groundless, Barney must stand, hat in hand, lips\r\nsealed, never answering a word. He must make no reply, no explanation;\r\nthe judgment of the master must be deemed infallible, for his power is\r\nabsolute and irresponsible. In a free state, a master, thus complaining\r\nwithout cause, of his ostler, might be told—“Sir, I am sorry I cannot\r\nplease you, but, since I have done the best I can, your remedy is to\r\ndismiss me.” Here, however, the ostler must stand, listen and tremble.\r\nOne of the most heart-saddening and humiliating scenes I ever\r\nwitnessed, was the whipping of Old Barney, by Col. Lloyd himself. Here\r\nwere two men, both advanced in years; there were the silvery locks of\r\nCol. L., and there was the bald and toil-worn brow of Old Barney;\r\nmaster and slave; superior and inferior here, but _equals_ at the bar\r\nof God; and, in the common course of events, they must both soon meet\r\nin another world, in a world where all distinctions, except those based\r\non obedience and disobedience, are blotted out forever. “Uncover your\r\nhead!” said the imperious master; he was obeyed. “Take off your jacket,\r\nyou old rascal!” and off came Barney’s jacket. “Down on your knees!”\r\ndown knelt the old man, his shoulders bare, his bald head glistening in\r\nthe sun, and his aged knees on the cold, damp ground. In his humble and\r\ndebasing attitude, the master—that master to whom he had given the best\r\nyears and the best strength of his life—came forward, and laid on\r\nthirty lashes, with his horse whip. The old man bore it patiently, to\r\nthe last, answering each blow with a slight shrug of the shoulders, and\r\na groan. I cannot think that Col. Lloyd succeeded in marring the flesh\r\nof Old Barney very seriously, for the whip was a light, riding whip;\r\nbut the spectacle of an aged man—a husband and a father—humbly kneeling\r\nbefore a worm of the dust, surprised and shocked me at the time; and\r\nsince I have grown old enough to think on the wickedness of slavery,\r\nfew facts have been of more value to me than this, to which I was a\r\nwitness. It reveals slavery in its true color, and in its maturity of\r\nrepulsive hatefulness. I owe it to truth, however, to say, that this\r\nwas the first and the last time I ever saw Old Barney, or any other\r\nslave, compelled to kneel to receive a whipping.\r\n\r\nI saw, at the stable, another incident, which I will relate, as it is\r\nillustrative of a phase of slavery to which I have already referred in\r\nanother connection. Besides two other coachmen, Col. Lloyd owned one\r\nnamed William, who, strangely enough, was often called by his surname,\r\nWilks, by white and colored people on the home plantation. Wilks was a\r\nvery fine looking man. He was about as white as anybody on the\r\nplantation; and in manliness of form, and comeliness of features, he\r\nbore a very striking resemblance to Mr. Murray Lloyd. It was whispered,\r\nand pretty generally admitted as a fact, that William Wilks was a son\r\nof Col. Lloyd, by a highly favored slave-woman, who was still on the\r\nplantation. There were many reasons for believing this whisper, not\r\nonly in William’s appearance, but in the undeniable freedom which he\r\nenjoyed over all others, and his apparent consciousness of being\r\nsomething more than a slave to his master. It was notorious, too, that\r\nWilliam had a deadly enemy in Murray Lloyd, whom he so much resembled,\r\nand that the latter greatly worried his father with importunities to\r\nsell William. Indeed, he gave his father no rest until he did sell him,\r\nto Austin Woldfolk, the great slave-trader at that time. Before selling\r\nhim, however, Mr. L. tried what giving William a whipping would do,\r\ntoward making things smooth; but this was a failure. It was a\r\ncompromise, and defeated itself; for, immediately after the infliction,\r\nthe heart-sickened colonel atoned to William for the abuse, by giving\r\nhim a gold watch and chain. Another fact, somewhat curious, is, that\r\nthough sold to the remorseless _Woldfolk_, taken in irons to Baltimore\r\nand cast into prison, with a view to being driven to the south,\r\nWilliam, by _some_ means—always a mystery to me—outbid all his\r\npurchasers, paid for himself, _and now resides in Baltimore, a_\r\nFREEMAN. Is there not room to suspect, that, as the gold watch was\r\npresented to atone for the whipping, a purse of gold was given him by\r\nthe same hand, with which to effect his purchase, as an atonement for\r\nthe indignity involved in selling his own flesh and blood. All the\r\ncircumstances of William, on the great house farm, show him to have\r\noccupied a different position from the other slaves, and, certainly,\r\nthere is nothing in the supposed hostility of slaveholders to\r\namalgamation, to forbid the supposition that William Wilks was the son\r\nof Edward Lloyd. _Practical_ amalgamation is common in every\r\nneighborhood where I have been in slavery.\r\n\r\nCol. Lloyd was not in the way of knowing much of the real opinions and\r\nfeelings of his slaves respecting him. The distance between him and\r\nthem was far too great to admit of such knowledge. His slaves were so\r\nnumerous, that he did not know them when he saw them. Nor, indeed, did\r\nall his slaves know him. In this respect, he was inconveniently rich.\r\nIt is reported of him, that, while riding along the road one day, he\r\nmet a colored man, and addressed him in the usual way of speaking to\r\ncolored people on the public highways of the south: “Well, boy, who do\r\nyou belong to?” “To Col. Lloyd,” replied the slave. “Well, does the\r\ncolonel treat you well?” “No, sir,” was the ready reply. “What? does he\r\nwork you too hard?” “Yes, sir.” “Well, don’t he give enough to eat?”\r\n“Yes, sir, he gives me enough, such as it is.” The colonel, after\r\nascertaining where the slave belonged, rode on; the slave also went on\r\nabout his business, not dreaming that he had been conversing with his\r\nmaster. He thought, said and heard nothing more of the matter, until\r\ntwo or three weeks afterwards. The poor man was then informed by his\r\noverseer, that, for having found fault with his master, he was now to\r\nbe sold to a Georgia trader. He was immediately chained and handcuffed;\r\nand thus, without a moment’s warning he was snatched away, and forever\r\nsundered from his family and friends, by a hand more unrelenting than\r\nthat of death. _This_ is the penalty of telling the simple truth, in\r\nanswer to a series of plain questions. It is partly in consequence of\r\nsuch facts, that slaves, when inquired of as to their condition and the\r\ncharacter of their masters, almost invariably say they are contented,\r\nand that their masters are kind. Slaveholders have been known to send\r\nspies among their slaves, to ascertain, if possible, their views and\r\nfeelings in regard to their condition. The frequency of this had the\r\neffect to establish among the slaves the maxim, that a still tongue\r\nmakes a wise head. They suppress the truth rather than take the\r\nconsequence of telling it, and, in so doing, they prove themselves a\r\npart of the human family. If they have anything to say of their master,\r\nit is, generally, something in his favor, especially when speaking to\r\nstrangers. I was frequently asked, while a slave, if I had a kind\r\nmaster, and I do not remember ever to have given a negative reply. Nor\r\ndid I, when pursuing this course, consider myself as uttering what was\r\nutterly false; for I always measured the kindness of my master by the\r\nstandard of kindness set up by slaveholders around us. However, slaves\r\nare like other people, and imbibe similar prejudices. They are apt to\r\nthink _their condition_ better than that of others. Many, under the\r\ninfluence of this prejudice, think their own masters are better than\r\nthe masters of other slaves; and this, too, in some cases, when the\r\nvery reverse is true. Indeed, it is not uncommon for slaves even to\r\nfall out and quarrel among themselves about the relative kindness of\r\ntheir masters, contending for the superior goodness of his own over\r\nthat of others. At the very same time, they mutually execrate their\r\nmasters, when viewed separately. It was so on our plantation. When Col.\r\nLloyd’s slaves met those of Jacob Jepson, they seldom parted without a\r\nquarrel about their masters; Col. Lloyd’s slaves contending that he was\r\nthe richest, and Mr. Jepson’s slaves that he was the smartest, man of\r\nthe two. Col. Lloyd’s slaves would boost his ability to buy and sell\r\nJacob Jepson; Mr. Jepson’s slaves would boast his ability to whip Col.\r\nLloyd. These quarrels would almost always end in a fight between the\r\nparties; those that beat were supposed to have gained the point at\r\nissue. They seemed to think that the greatness of their masters was\r\ntransferable to themselves. To be a SLAVE, was thought to be bad\r\nenough; but to be a _poor man’s_ slave, was deemed a disgrace, indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. _A Chapter of Horrors_\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTIN GORE—A SKETCH OF HIS CHARACTER—OVERSEERS AS A CLASS—THEIR\r\nPECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS—THE MARKED INDIVIDUALITY OF AUSTIN GORE—HIS\r\nSENSE OF DUTY—HOW HE WHIPPED—MURDER OF POOR DENBY—HOW IT\r\nOCCURRED—SENSATION—HOW GORE MADE PEACE WITH COL. LLOYD—THE MURDER\r\nUNPUNISHED—ANOTHER DREADFUL MURDER NARRATED—NO LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION\r\nOF SLAVES CAN BE ENFORCED IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have already intimated elsewhere, the slaves on Col. Lloyd’s\r\nplantation, whose hard lot, under Mr. Sevier, the reader has already\r\nnoticed and deplored, were not permitted to enjoy the comparatively\r\nmoderate rule of Mr. Hopkins. The latter was succeeded by a very\r\ndifferent man. The name of the new overseer was Austin Gore. Upon this\r\nindividual I would fix particular attention; for under his rule there\r\nwas more suffering from violence and bloodshed than had—according to\r\nthe older slaves ever been experienced before on this plantation. I\r\nconfess, I hardly know how to bring this man fitly before the reader.\r\nHe was, it is true, an overseer, and possessed, to a large extent, the\r\npeculiar characteristics of his class; yet, to call him merely an\r\noverseer, would not give the reader a fair notion of the man. I speak\r\nof overseers as a class. They are such. They are as distinct from the\r\nslaveholding gentry of the south, as are the fishwomen of Paris, and\r\nthe coal-heavers of London, distinct from other members of society.\r\nThey constitute a separate fraternity at the south, not less marked\r\nthan is the fraternity of Park Lane bullies in New York. They have been\r\narranged and classified by that great law of attraction, which\r\ndetermines the spheres and affinities of men; which ordains, that men,\r\nwhose malign and brutal propensities predominate over their moral and\r\nintellectual endowments, shall, naturally, fall into those employments\r\nwhich promise the largest gratification to those predominating\r\ninstincts or propensities. The office of overseer takes this raw\r\nmaterial of vulgarity and brutality, and stamps it as a distinct class\r\nof southern society. But, in this class, as in all other classes, there\r\nare characters of marked individuality, even while they bear a general\r\nresemblance to the mass. Mr. Gore was one of those, to whom a general\r\ncharacterization would do no manner of justice. He was an overseer; but\r\nhe was something more. With the malign and tyrannical qualities of an\r\noverseer, he combined something of the lawful master. He had the\r\nartfulness and the mean ambition of his class; but he was wholly free\r\nfrom the disgusting swagger and noisy bravado of his fraternity. There\r\nwas an easy air of independence about him; a calm self-possession, and\r\na sternness of glance, which might well daunt hearts less timid than\r\nthose of poor slaves, accustomed from childhood and through life to\r\ncower before a driver’s lash. The home plantation of Col. Lloyd\r\nafforded an ample field for the exercise of the qualifications for\r\noverseership, which he possessed in such an eminent degree.\r\n\r\nMr. Gore was one of those overseers, who could torture the slightest\r\nword or look into impudence; he had the nerve, not only to resent, but\r\nto punish, promptly and severely. He never allowed himself to be\r\nanswered back, by a slave. In this, he was as lordly and as imperious\r\nas Col. Edward Lloyd, himself; acting always up to the maxim,\r\npractically maintained by slaveholders, that it is better that a dozen\r\nslaves suffer under the lash, without fault, than that the master or\r\nthe overseer should _seem_ to have been wrong in the presence of the\r\nslave. _Everything must be absolute here_. Guilty or not guilty, it is\r\nenough to be accused, to be sure of a flogging. The very presence of\r\nthis man Gore was painful, and I shunned him as I would have shunned a\r\nrattlesnake. His piercing, black eyes, and sharp, shrill voice, ever\r\nawakened sensations of terror among the slaves. For so young a man (I\r\ndescribe him as he was, twenty-five or thirty years ago) Mr. Gore was\r\nsingularly reserved and grave in the presence of slaves. He indulged in\r\nno jokes, said no funny things, and kept his own counsels. Other\r\noverseers, how brutal soever they might be, were, at times, inclined to\r\ngain favor with the slaves, by indulging a little pleasantry; but Gore\r\nwas never known to be guilty of any such weakness. He was always the\r\ncold, distant, unapproachable _overseer_ of Col. Edward Lloyd’s\r\nplantation, and needed no higher pleasure than was involved in a\r\nfaithful discharge of the duties of his office. When he whipped, he\r\nseemed to do so from a sense of duty, and feared no consequences. What\r\nHopkins did reluctantly, Gore did with alacrity. There was a stern\r\nwill, an iron-like reality, about this Gore, which would have easily\r\nmade him the chief of a band of pirates, had his environments been\r\nfavorable to such a course of life. All the coolness, savage barbarity\r\nand freedom from moral restraint, which are necessary in the character\r\nof a pirate-chief, centered, I think, in this man Gore. Among many\r\nother deeds of shocking cruelty which he perpetrated, while I was at\r\nMr. Lloyd’s, was the murder of a young colored man, named Denby. He was\r\nsometimes called Bill Denby, or Demby; (I write from sound, and the\r\nsounds on Lloyd’s plantation are not very certain.) I knew him well. He\r\nwas a powerful young man, full of animal spirits, and, so far as I\r\nknow, he was among the most valuable of Col. Lloyd’s slaves. In\r\nsomething—I know not what—he offended this Mr. Austin Gore, and, in\r\naccordance with the custom of the latter, he under took to flog him. He\r\ngave Denby but few stripes; the latter broke away from him and plunged\r\ninto the creek, and, standing there to the depth of his neck in water,\r\nhe refused to come out at the order of the overseer; whereupon, for\r\nthis refusal, _Gore shot him dead!_ It is said that Gore gave Denby\r\nthree calls, telling him that if he did not obey the last call, he\r\nwould shoot him. When the third call was given, Denby stood his ground\r\nfirmly; and this raised the question, in the minds of the by-standing\r\nslaves—“Will he dare to shoot?” Mr. Gore, without further parley, and\r\nwithout making any further effort to induce Denby to come out of the\r\nwater, raised his gun deliberately to his face, took deadly aim at his\r\nstanding victim, and, in an instant, poor Denby was numbered with the\r\ndead. His mangled body sank out of sight, and only his warm, red blood\r\nmarked the place where he had stood.\r\n\r\nThis devilish outrage, this fiendish murder, produced, as it was well\r\ncalculated to do, a tremendous sensation. A thrill of horror flashed\r\nthrough every soul on the plantation, if I may except the guilty wretch\r\nwho had committed the hell-black deed. While the slaves generally were\r\npanic-struck, and howling with alarm, the murderer himself was calm and\r\ncollected, and appeared as though nothing unusual had happened. The\r\natrocity roused my old master, and he spoke out, in reprobation of it;\r\nbut the whole thing proved to be less than a nine days’ wonder. Both\r\nCol. Lloyd and my old master arraigned Gore for his cruelty in the\r\nmatter, but this amounted to nothing. His reply, or explanation—as I\r\nremember to have heard it at the time was, that the extraordinary\r\nexpedient was demanded by necessity; that Denby had become\r\nunmanageable; that he had set a dangerous example to the other slaves;\r\nand that, without some such prompt measure as that to which he had\r\nresorted, were adopted, there would be an end to all rule and order on\r\nthe plantation. That very convenient covert for all manner of cruelty\r\nand outrage that cowardly alarm-cry, that the slaves would _“take the\r\nplace,”_ was pleaded, in extenuation of this revolting crime, just as\r\nit had been cited in defense of a thousand similar ones. He argued,\r\nthat if one slave refused to be corrected, and was allowed to escape\r\nwith his life, when he had been told that he should lose it if he\r\npersisted in his course, the other slaves would soon copy his example;\r\nthe result of which would be, the freedom of the slaves, and the\r\nenslavement of the whites. I have every reason to believe that Mr.\r\nGore’s defense, or explanation, was deemed satisfactory—at least to\r\nCol. Lloyd. He was continued in his office on the plantation. His fame\r\nas an overseer went abroad, and his horrid crime was not even submitted\r\nto judicial investigation. The murder was committed in the presence of\r\nslaves, and they, of course, could neither institute a suit, nor\r\ntestify against the murderer. His bare word would go further in a court\r\nof law, than the united testimony of ten thousand black witnesses.\r\n\r\nAll that Mr. Gore had to do, was to make his peace with Col. Lloyd.\r\nThis done, and the guilty perpetrator of one of the most foul murders\r\ngoes unwhipped of justice, and uncensured by the community in which he\r\nlives. Mr. Gore lived in St. Michael’s, Talbot county, when I left\r\nMaryland; if he is still alive he probably yet resides there; and I\r\nhave no reason to doubt that he is now as highly esteemed, and as\r\ngreatly respected, as though his guilty soul had never been stained\r\nwith innocent blood. I am well aware that what I have now written will\r\nby some be branded as false and malicious. It will be denied, not only\r\nthat such a thing ever did transpire, as I have now narrated, but that\r\nsuch a thing could happen in _Maryland_. I can only say—believe it or\r\nnot—that I have said nothing but the literal truth, gainsay it who may.\r\n\r\nI speak advisedly when I say this,—that killing a slave, or any colored\r\nperson, in Talbot county, Maryland, is not treated as a crime, either\r\nby the courts or the community. Mr. Thomas Lanman, ship carpenter, of\r\nSt. Michael’s, killed two slaves, one of whom he butchered with a\r\nhatchet, by knocking his brains out. He used to boast of the commission\r\nof the awful and bloody deed. I have heard him do so, laughingly,\r\nsaying, among other things, that he was the only benefactor of his\r\ncountry in the company, and that when “others would do as much as he\r\nhad done, we should be relieved of the d—d niggers.”\r\n\r\nAs an evidence of the reckless disregard of human life where the life\r\nis that of a slave I may state the notorious fact, that the wife of Mr.\r\nGiles Hicks, who lived but a short distance from Col. Lloyd’s, with her\r\nown hands murdered my wife’s cousin, a young girl between fifteen and\r\nsixteen years of age—mutilating her person in a most shocking manner.\r\nThe atrocious woman, in the paroxysm of her wrath, not content with\r\nmurdering her victim, literally mangled her face, and broke her breast\r\nbone. Wild, however, and infuriated as she was, she took the precaution\r\nto cause the slave-girl to be buried; but the facts of the case coming\r\nabroad, very speedily led to the disinterment of the remains of the\r\nmurdered slave-girl. A coroner’s jury was assembled, who decided that\r\nthe girl had come to her death by severe beating. It was ascertained\r\nthat the offense for which this girl was thus hurried out of the world,\r\nwas this: she had been set that night, and several preceding nights, to\r\nmind Mrs. Hicks’s baby, and having fallen into a sound sleep, the baby\r\ncried, waking Mrs. Hicks, but not the slave-girl. Mrs. Hicks, becoming\r\ninfuriated at the girl’s tardiness, after calling several times, jumped\r\nfrom her bed and seized a piece of fire-wood from the fireplace; and\r\nthen, as she lay fast asleep, she deliberately pounded in her skull and\r\nbreast-bone, and thus ended her life. I will not say that this most\r\nhorrid murder produced no sensation in the community. It _did_ produce\r\na sensation; but, incredible to tell, the moral sense of the community\r\nwas blunted too entirely by the ordinary nature of slavery horrors, to\r\nbring the murderess to punishment. A warrant was issued for her arrest,\r\nbut, for some reason or other, that warrant was never served. Thus did\r\nMrs. Hicks not only escape condign punishment, but even the pain and\r\nmortification of being arraigned before a court of justice.\r\n\r\nWhilst I am detailing the bloody deeds that took place during my stay\r\non Col. Lloyd’s plantation, I will briefly narrate another dark\r\ntransaction, which occurred about the same time as the murder of Denby\r\nby Mr. Gore.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the river Wye, opposite from Col. Lloyd’s, there lived a\r\nMr. Beal Bondley, a wealthy slaveholder. In the direction of his land,\r\nand near the shore, there was an excellent oyster fishing ground, and\r\nto this, some of the slaves of Col. Lloyd occasionally resorted in\r\ntheir little canoes, at night, with a view to make up the deficiency of\r\ntheir scanty allowance of food, by the oysters that they could easily\r\nget there. This, Mr. Bondley took it into his head to regard as a\r\ntrespass, and while an old man belonging to Col. Lloyd was engaged in\r\ncatching a few of the many millions of oysters that lined the bottom of\r\nthat creek, to satisfy his hunger, the villainous Mr. Bondley, lying in\r\nambush, without the slightest ceremony, discharged the contents of his\r\nmusket into the back and shoulders of the poor old man. As good fortune\r\nwould have it, the shot did not prove mortal, and Mr. Bondley came\r\nover, the next day, to see Col. Lloyd—whether to pay him for his\r\nproperty, or to justify himself for what he had done, I know not; but\r\nthis I _can_ say, the cruel and dastardly transaction was speedily\r\nhushed up; there was very little said about it at all, and nothing was\r\npublicly done which looked like the application of the principle of\r\njustice to the man whom _chance_, only, saved from being an actual\r\nmurderer. One of the commonest sayings to which my ears early became\r\naccustomed, on Col. Lloyd’s plantation and elsewhere in Maryland, was,\r\nthat it was _“worth but half a cent to kill a nigger, and a half a cent\r\nto bury him;”_ and the facts of my experience go far to justify the\r\npractical truth of this strange proverb. Laws for the protection of the\r\nlives of the slaves, are, as they must needs be, utterly incapable of\r\nbeing enforced, where the very parties who are nominally protected, are\r\nnot permitted to give evidence, in courts of law, against the only\r\nclass of persons from whom abuse, outrage and murder might be\r\nreasonably apprehended. While I heard of numerous murders committed by\r\nslaveholders on the Eastern Shores of Maryland, I never knew a solitary\r\ninstance in which a slaveholder was either hung or imprisoned for\r\nhaving murdered a slave. The usual pretext for killing a slave is, that\r\nthe slave has offered resistance. Should a slave, when assaulted, but\r\nraise his hand in self defense, the white assaulting party is fully\r\njustified by southern, or Maryland, public opinion, in shooting the\r\nslave down. Sometimes this is done, simply because it is alleged that\r\nthe slave has been saucy. But here I leave this phase of the society of\r\nmy early childhood, and will relieve the kind reader of these\r\nheart-sickening details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. _Personal Treatment_\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS LUCRETIA—HER KINDNESS—HOW IT WAS MANIFESTED—“IKE”—A BATTLE WITH\r\nHIM—THE CONSEQUENCES THEREOF—MISS LUCRETIA’S BALSAM—BREAD—HOW I\r\nOBTAINED IT—BEAMS OF SUNLIGHT AMIDST THE GENERAL DARKNESS—SUFFERING\r\nFROM COLD—HOW WE TOOK OUR MEALS—ORDERS TO PREPARE FOR\r\nBALTIMORE—OVERJOYED AT THE THOUGHT OF QUITTING THE\r\nPLANTATION—EXTRAORDINARY CLEANSING—COUSIN TOM’S VERSION OF\r\nBALTIMORE—ARRIVAL THERE—KIND RECEPTION GIVEN ME BY MRS. SOPHIA\r\nAULD—LITTLE TOMMY—MY NEW POSITION—MY NEW DUTIES—A TURNING POINT IN MY\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have nothing cruel or shocking to relate of my own personal\r\nexperience, while I remained on Col. Lloyd’s plantation, at the home of\r\nmy old master. An occasional cuff from Aunt Katy, and a regular\r\nwhipping from old master, such as any heedless and mischievous boy\r\nmight get from his father, is all that I can mention of this sort. I\r\nwas not old enough to work in the field, and, there being little else\r\nthan field work to perform, I had much leisure. The most I had to do,\r\nwas, to drive up the cows in the evening, to keep the front yard clean,\r\nand to perform small errands for my young mistress, Lucretia Auld. I\r\nhave reasons for thinking this lady was very kindly disposed toward me,\r\nand, although I was not often the object of her attention, I constantly\r\nregarded her as my friend, and was always glad when it was my privilege\r\nto do her a service. In a family where there was so much that was\r\nharsh, cold and indifferent, the slightest word or look of kindness\r\npassed, with me, for its full value. Miss Lucretia—as we all continued\r\nto call her long after her marriage—had bestowed upon me such words and\r\nlooks as taught me that she pitied me, if she did not love me. In\r\naddition to words and looks, she sometimes gave me a piece of bread and\r\nbutter; a thing not set down in the bill of fare, and which must have\r\nbeen an extra ration, planned aside from either Aunt Katy or old\r\nmaster, solely out of the tender regard and friendship she had for me.\r\nThen, too, I one day got into the wars with Uncle Able’s son, “Ike,”\r\nand had got sadly worsted; in fact, the little rascal had struck me\r\ndirectly in the forehead with a sharp piece of cinder, fused with iron,\r\nfrom the old blacksmith’s forge, which made a cross in my forehead very\r\nplainly to be seen now. The gash bled very freely, and I roared very\r\nloudly and betook myself home. The coldhearted Aunt Katy paid no\r\nattention either to my wound or my roaring, except to tell me it served\r\nme right; I had no business with Ike; it was good for me; I would now\r\nkeep away _“from dem Lloyd niggers.”_ Miss Lucretia, in this state of\r\nthe case, came forward; and, in quite a different spirit from that\r\nmanifested by Aunt Katy, she called me into the parlor (an extra\r\nprivilege of itself) and, without using toward me any of the\r\nhard-hearted and reproachful epithets of my kitchen tormentor, she\r\nquietly acted the good Samaritan. With her own soft hand she washed the\r\nblood from my head and face, fetched her own balsam bottle, and with\r\nthe balsam wetted a nice piece of white linen, and bound up my head.\r\nThe balsam was not more healing to the wound in my head, than her\r\nkindness was healing to the wounds in my spirit, made by the unfeeling\r\nwords of Aunt Katy. After this, Miss Lucretia was my friend. I felt her\r\nto be such; and I have no doubt that the simple act of binding up my\r\nhead, did much to awaken in her mind an interest in my welfare. It is\r\nquite true, that this interest was never very marked, and it seldom\r\nshowed itself in anything more than in giving me a piece of bread when\r\nI was hungry; but this was a great favor on a slave plantation, and I\r\nwas the only one of the children to whom such attention was paid. When\r\nvery hungry, I would go into the back yard and play under Miss\r\nLucretia’s window. When pretty severely pinched by hunger, I had a\r\nhabit of singing, which the good lady very soon came to understand as a\r\npetition for a piece of bread. When I sung under Miss Lucretia’s\r\nwindow, I was very apt to get well paid for my music. The reader will\r\nsee that I now had two friends, both at important points—Mas’ Daniel at\r\nthe great house, and Miss Lucretia at home. From Mas’ Daniel I got\r\nprotection from the bigger boys; and from Miss Lucretia I got bread, by\r\nsinging when I was hungry, and sympathy when I was abused by that\r\ntermagant, who had the reins of government in the kitchen. For such\r\nfriendship I felt deeply grateful, and bitter as are my recollections\r\nof slavery, I love to recall any instances of kindness, any sunbeams of\r\nhumane treatment, which found way to my soul through the iron grating\r\nof my house of bondage. Such beams seem all the brighter from the\r\ngeneral darkness into which they penetrate, and the impression they\r\nmake is vividly distinct and beautiful.\r\n\r\nAs I have before intimated, I was seldom whipped—and never severely—by\r\nmy old master. I suffered little from the treatment I received, except\r\nfrom hunger and cold. These were my two great physical troubles. I\r\ncould neither get a sufficiency of food nor of clothing; but I suffered\r\nless from hunger than from cold. In hottest summer and coldest winter,\r\nI was kept almost in a state of nudity; no shoes, no stockings, no\r\njacket, no trowsers; nothing but coarse sackcloth or tow-linen, made\r\ninto a sort of shirt, reaching down to my knees. This I wore night and\r\nday, changing it once a week. In the day time I could protect myself\r\npretty well, by keeping on the sunny side of the house; and in bad\r\nweather, in the corner of the kitchen chimney. The great difficulty\r\nwas, to keep warm during the night. I had no bed. The pigs in the pen\r\nhad leaves, and the horses in the stable had straw, but the children\r\nhad no beds. They lodged anywhere in the ample kitchen. I slept,\r\ngenerally, in a little closet, without even a blanket to cover me. In\r\nvery cold weather. I sometimes got down the bag in which corn-meal was\r\nusually carried to the mill, and crawled into that. Sleeping there,\r\nwith my head in and feet out, I was partly protected, though not\r\ncomfortable. My feet have been so cracked with the frost, that the pen\r\nwith which I am writing might be laid in the gashes. The manner of\r\ntaking our meals at old master’s, indicated but little refinement. Our\r\ncorn-meal mush, when sufficiently cooled, was placed in a large wooden\r\ntray, or trough, like those used in making maple sugar here in the\r\nnorth. This tray was set down, either on the floor of the kitchen, or\r\nout of doors on the ground; and the children were called, like so many\r\npigs; and like so many pigs they would come, and literally devour the\r\nmush—some with oyster shells, some with pieces of shingles, and none\r\nwith spoons. He that eat fastest got most, and he that was strongest\r\ngot the best place; and few left the trough really satisfied. I was the\r\nmost unlucky of any, for Aunt Katy had no good feeling for me; and if I\r\npushed any of the other children, or if they told her anything\r\nunfavorable of me, she always believed the worst, and was sure to whip\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAs I grew older and more thoughtful, I was more and more filled with a\r\nsense of my wretchedness. The cruelty of Aunt Katy, the hunger and cold\r\nI suffered, and the terrible reports of wrong and outrage which came to\r\nmy ear, together with what I almost daily witnessed, led me, when yet\r\nbut eight or nine years old, to wish I had never been born. I used to\r\ncontrast my condition with the black-birds, in whose wild and sweet\r\nsongs I fancied them so happy! Their apparent joy only deepened the\r\nshades of my sorrow. There are thoughtful days in the lives of\r\nchildren—at least there were in mine when they grapple with all the\r\ngreat, primary subjects of knowledge, and reach, in a moment,\r\nconclusions which no subsequent experience can shake. I was just as\r\nwell aware of the unjust, unnatural and murderous character of slavery,\r\nwhen nine years old, as I am now. Without any appeal to books, to laws,\r\nor to authorities of any kind, it was enough to accept God as a father,\r\nto regard slavery as a crime.\r\n\r\nI was not ten years old when I left Col. Lloyd’s plantation for\r\nBalitmore(sic). I left that plantation with inexpressible joy. I never\r\nshall forget the ecstacy with which I received the intelligence from my\r\nfriend, Miss Lucretia, that my old master had determined to let me go\r\nto Baltimore to live with Mr. Hugh Auld, a brother to Mr. Thomas Auld,\r\nmy old master’s son-in-law. I received this information about three\r\ndays before my departure. They were three of the happiest days of my\r\nchildhood. I spent the largest part of these three days in the creek,\r\nwashing off the plantation scurf, and preparing for my new home. Mrs.\r\nLucretia took a lively interest in getting me ready. She told me I must\r\nget all the dead skin off my feet and knees, before I could go to\r\nBaltimore, for the people there were very cleanly, and would laugh at\r\nme if I looked dirty; and, besides, she was intending to give me a pair\r\nof trowsers, which I should not put on unless I got all the dirt off.\r\nThis was a warning to which I was bound to take heed; for the thought\r\nof owning a pair of trowsers, was great, indeed. It was almost a\r\nsufficient motive, not only to induce me to scrub off the _mange_ (as\r\npig drovers would call it) but the skin as well. So I went at it in\r\ngood earnest, working for the first time in the hope of reward. I was\r\ngreatly excited, and could hardly consent to sleep, lest I should be\r\nleft. The ties that, ordinarily, bind children to their homes, were all\r\nsevered, or they never had any existence in my case, at least so far as\r\nthe home plantation of Col. L. was concerned. I therefore found no\r\nsevere trail at the moment of my departure, such as I had experienced\r\nwhen separated from my home in Tuckahoe. My home at my old master’s was\r\ncharmless to me; it was not home, but a prison to me; on parting from\r\nit, I could not feel that I was leaving anything which I could have\r\nenjoyed by staying. My mother was now long dead; my grandmother was far\r\naway, so that I seldom saw her; Aunt Katy was my unrelenting tormentor;\r\nand my two sisters and brothers, owing to our early separation in life,\r\nand the family-destroying power of slavery, were, comparatively,\r\nstrangers to me. The fact of our relationship was almost blotted out. I\r\nlooked for _home_ elsewhere, and was confident of finding none which I\r\nshould relish less than the one I was leaving. If, however, I found in\r\nmy new home to which I was going with such blissful\r\nanticipations—hardship, whipping and nakedness, I had the questionable\r\nconsolation that I should not have escaped any one of these evils by\r\nremaining under the management of Aunt Katy. Then, too, I thought,\r\nsince I had endured much in this line on Lloyd’s plantation, I could\r\nendure as much elsewhere, and especially at Baltimore; for I had\r\nsomething of the feeling about that city which is expressed in the\r\nsaying, that being “hanged in England, is better than dying a natural\r\ndeath in Ireland.” I had the strongest desire to see Baltimore. My\r\ncousin Tom—a boy two or three years older than I—had been there, and\r\nthough not fluent (he stuttered immoderately) in speech, he had\r\ninspired me with that desire, by his eloquent description of the place.\r\nTom was, sometimes, Capt. Auld’s cabin boy; and when he came from\r\nBaltimore, he was always a sort of hero amongst us, at least till his\r\nBaltimore trip was forgotten. I could never tell him of anything, or\r\npoint out anything that struck me as beautiful or powerful, but that he\r\nhad seen something in Baltimore far surpassing it. Even the great house\r\nitself, with all its pictures within, and pillars without, he had the\r\nhardihood to say “was nothing to Baltimore.” He bought a trumpet (worth\r\nsix pence) and brought it home; told what he had seen in the windows of\r\nstores; that he had heard shooting crackers, and seen soldiers; that he\r\nhad seen a steamboat; that there were ships in Baltimore that could\r\ncarry four such sloops as the “Sally Lloyd.” He said a great deal about\r\nthe market-house; he spoke of the bells ringing; and of many other\r\nthings which roused my curiosity very much; and, indeed, which\r\nheightened my hopes of happiness in my new home.\r\n\r\nWe sailed out of Miles river for Baltimore early on a Saturday morning.\r\nI remember only the day of the week; for, at that time, I had no\r\nknowledge of the days of the month, nor, indeed, of the months of the\r\nyear. On setting sail, I walked aft, and gave to Col. Lloyd’s\r\nplantation what I hoped would be the last look I should ever give to\r\nit, or to any place like it. My strong aversion to the great farm, was\r\nnot owing to my own personal suffering, but the daily suffering of\r\nothers, and to the certainty that I must, sooner or later, be placed\r\nunder the barbarous rule of an overseer, such as the accomplished Gore,\r\nor the brutal and drunken Plummer. After taking this last view, I\r\nquitted the quarter deck, made my way to the bow of the sloop, and\r\nspent the remainder of the day in looking ahead; interesting myself in\r\nwhat was in the distance, rather than what was near by or behind. The\r\nvessels, sweeping along the bay, were very interesting objects. The\r\nbroad bay opened like a shoreless ocean on my boyish vision, filling me\r\nwith wonder and admiration.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon, we reached Annapolis, the capital of the state,\r\nstopping there not long enough to admit of my going ashore. It was the\r\nfirst large town I had ever seen; and though it was inferior to many a\r\nfactory village in New England, my feelings, on seeing it, were excited\r\nto a pitch very little below that reached by travelers at the first\r\nview of Rome. The dome of the state house was especially imposing, and\r\nsurpassed in grandeur the appearance of the great house. The great\r\nworld was opening upon me very rapidly, and I was eagerly acquainting\r\nmyself with its multifarious lessons.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in Baltimore on Sunday morning, and landed at Smith’s wharf,\r\nnot far from Bowly’s wharf. We had on board the sloop a large flock of\r\nsheep, for the Baltimore market; and, after assisting in driving them\r\nto the slaughter house of Mr. Curtis, on Loudon Slater’s Hill, I was\r\nspeedily conducted by Rich—one of the hands belonging to the sloop—to\r\nmy new home in Alliciana street, near Gardiner’s ship-yard, on Fell’s\r\nPoint. Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Auld, my new mistress and master, were both at\r\nhome, and met me at the door with their rosy cheeked little son,\r\nThomas, to take care of whom was to constitute my future occupation. In\r\nfact, it was to “little Tommy,” rather than to his parents, that old\r\nmaster made a present of me; and though there was no _legal_ form or\r\narrangement entered into, I have no doubt that Mr. and Mrs. Auld felt\r\nthat, in due time, I should be the legal property of their bright-eyed\r\nand beloved boy, Tommy. I was struck with the appearance, especially,\r\nof my new mistress. Her face was lighted with the kindliest emotions;\r\nand the reflex influence of her countenance, as well as the tenderness\r\nwith which she seemed to regard me, while asking me sundry little\r\nquestions, greatly delighted me, and lit up, to my fancy, the pathway\r\nof my future. Miss Lucretia was kind; but my new mistress, “Miss\r\nSophy,” surpassed her in kindness of manner. Little Thomas was\r\naffectionately told by his mother, that _“there was his Freddy,”_ and\r\nthat “Freddy would take care of him;” and I was told to “be kind to\r\nlittle Tommy”—an injunction I scarcely needed, for I had already fallen\r\nin love with the dear boy; and with these little ceremonies I was\r\ninitiated into my new home, and entered upon my peculiar duties, with\r\nnot a cloud above the horizon.\r\n\r\nI may say here, that I regard my removal from Col. Lloyd’s plantation\r\nas one of the most interesting and fortunate events of my life. Viewing\r\nit in the light of human likelihoods, it is quite probable that, but\r\nfor the mere circumstance of being thus removed before the rigors of\r\nslavery had fastened upon me; before my young spirit had been crushed\r\nunder the iron control of the slave-driver, instead of being, today, a\r\nFREEMAN, I might have been wearing the galling chains of slavery. I\r\nhave sometimes felt, however, that there was something more intelligent\r\nthan _chance_, and something more certain than _luck_, to be seen in\r\nthe circumstance. If I have made any progress in knowledge; if I have\r\ncherished any honorable aspirations, or have, in any manner, worthily\r\ndischarged the duties of a member of an oppressed people; this little\r\ncircumstance must be allowed its due weight in giving my life that\r\ndirection. I have ever regarded it as the first plain manifestation of\r\nthat\r\n\r\nDivinity that shapes our ends,\r\nRough hew them as we will.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was not the only boy on the plantation that might have been sent to\r\nlive in Baltimore. There was a wide margin from which to select. There\r\nwere boys younger, boys older, and boys of the same age, belonging to\r\nmy old master some at his own house, and some at his farm—but the high\r\nprivilege fell to my lot.\r\n\r\nI may be deemed superstitious and egotistical, in regarding this event\r\nas a special interposition of Divine Providence in my favor; but the\r\nthought is a part of my history, and I should be false to the earliest\r\nand most cherished sentiments of my soul, if I suppressed, or hesitated\r\nto avow that opinion, although it may be characterized as irrational by\r\nthe wise, and ridiculous by the scoffer. From my earliest recollections\r\nof serious matters, I date the entertainment of something like an\r\nineffaceable conviction, that slavery would not always be able to hold\r\nme within its foul embrace; and this conviction, like a word of living\r\nfaith, strengthened me through the darkest trials of my lot. This good\r\nspirit was from God; and to him I offer thanksgiving and praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. _Life in Baltimore_\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY ANNOYANCES—PLANTATION REGRETS—MY MISTRESS, MISS SOPHA—HER\r\nHISTORY—HER KINDNESS TO ME—MY MASTER, HUGH AULD—HIS SOURNESS—MY\r\nINCREASED SENSITIVENESS—MY COMFORTS—MY OCCUPATION—THE BANEFUL EFFECTS\r\nOF SLAVEHOLDING ON MY DEAR AND GOOD MISTRESS—HOW SHE COMMENCED TEACHING\r\nME TO READ—WHY SHE CEASED TEACHING ME—CLOUDS GATHERING OVER MY BRIGHT\r\nPROSPECTS—MASTER AULD’S EXPOSITION OF THE TRUE PHILOSOPHY OF\r\nSLAVERY—CITY SLAVES—PLANTATION SLAVES—THE CONTRAST—EXCEPTIONS—MR.\r\nHAMILTON’S TWO SLAVES, HENRIETTA AND MARY—MRS. HAMILTON’S CRUEL\r\nTREATMENT OF THEM—THE PITEOUS ASPECT THEY PRESENTED—NO POWER MUST COME\r\nBETWEEN THE SLAVE AND THE SLAVEHOLDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce in Baltimore, with hard brick pavements under my feet, which\r\nalmost raised blisters, by their very heat, for it was in the height of\r\nsummer; walled in on all sides by towering brick buildings; with troops\r\nof hostile boys ready to pounce upon me at every street corner; with\r\nnew and strange objects glaring upon me at every step, and with\r\nstartling sounds reaching my ears from all directions, I for a time\r\nthought that, after all, the home plantation was a more desirable place\r\nof residence than my home on Alliciana street, in Baltimore. My country\r\neyes and ears were confused and bewildered here; but the boys were my\r\nchief trouble. They chased me, and called me _“Eastern Shore man,”_\r\ntill really I almost wished myself back on the Eastern Shore. I had to\r\nundergo a sort of moral acclimation, and when that was over, I did much\r\nbetter. My new mistress happily proved to be all she _seemed_ to be,\r\nwhen, with her husband, she met me at the door, with a most beaming,\r\nbenignant countenance. She was, naturally, of an excellent disposition,\r\nkind, gentle and cheerful. The supercilious contempt for the rights and\r\nfeelings of the slave, and the petulance and bad humor which generally\r\ncharacterize slaveholding ladies, were all quite absent from kind\r\n“Miss” Sophia’s manner and bearing toward me. She had, in truth, never\r\nbeen a slaveholder, but had—a thing quite unusual in the south—depended\r\nalmost entirely upon her own industry for a living. To this fact the\r\ndear lady, no doubt, owed the excellent preservation of her natural\r\ngoodness of heart, for slavery can change a saint into a sinner, and an\r\nangel into a demon. I hardly knew how to behave toward “Miss Sopha,” as\r\nI used to call Mrs. Hugh Auld. I had been treated as a _pig_ on the\r\nplantation; I was treated as a _child_ now. I could not even approach\r\nher as I had formerly approached Mrs. Thomas Auld. How could I hang\r\ndown my head, and speak with bated breath, when there was no pride to\r\nscorn me, no coldness to repel me, and no hatred to inspire me with\r\nfear? I therefore soon learned to regard her as something more akin to\r\na mother, than a slaveholding mistress. The crouching servility of a\r\nslave, usually so acceptable a quality to the haughty slaveholder, was\r\nnot understood nor desired by this gentle woman. So far from deeming it\r\nimpudent in a slave to look her straight in the face, as some\r\nslaveholding ladies do, she seemed ever to say, “look up, child; don’t\r\nbe afraid; see, I am full of kindness and good will toward you.” The\r\nhands belonging to Col. Lloyd’s sloop, esteemed it a great privilege to\r\nbe the bearers of parcels or messages to my new mistress; for whenever\r\nthey came, they were sure of a most kind and pleasant reception. If\r\nlittle Thomas was her son, and her most dearly beloved child, she, for\r\na time, at least, made me something like his half-brother in her\r\naffections. If dear Tommy was exalted to a place on his mother’s knee,\r\n“Feddy” was honored by a place at his mother’s side. Nor did he lack\r\nthe caressing strokes of her gentle hand, to convince him that, though\r\n_motherless_, he was not _friendless_. Mrs. Auld was not only a\r\nkind-hearted woman, but she was remarkably pious; frequent in her\r\nattendance of public worship, much given to reading the bible, and to\r\nchanting hymns of praise, when alone. Mr. Hugh Auld was altogether a\r\ndifferent character. He cared very little about religion, knew more of\r\nthe world, and was more of the world, than his wife. He set out,\r\ndoubtless to be—as the world goes—a respectable man, and to get on by\r\nbecoming a successful ship builder, in that city of ship building. This\r\nwas his ambition, and it fully occupied him. I was, of course, of very\r\nlittle consequence to him, compared with what I was to good Mrs. Auld;\r\nand, when he smiled upon me, as he sometimes did, the smile was\r\nborrowed from his lovely wife, and, like all borrowed light, was\r\ntransient, and vanished with the source whence it was derived. While I\r\nmust characterize Master Hugh as being a very sour man, and of\r\nforbidding appearance, it is due to him to acknowledge, that he was\r\nnever very cruel to me, according to the notion of cruelty in Maryland.\r\nThe first year or two which I spent in his house, he left me almost\r\nexclusively to the management of his wife. She was my law-giver. In\r\nhands so tender as hers, and in the absence of the cruelties of the\r\nplantation, I became, both physically and mentally, much more sensitive\r\nto good and ill treatment; and, perhaps, suffered more from a frown\r\nfrom my mistress, than I formerly did from a cuff at the hands of Aunt\r\nKaty. Instead of the cold, damp floor of my old master’s kitchen, I\r\nfound myself on carpets; for the corn bag in winter, I now had a good\r\nstraw bed, well furnished with covers; for the coarse corn-meal in the\r\nmorning, I now had good bread, and mush occasionally; for my poor\r\ntow-lien shirt, reaching to my knees, I had good, clean clothes. I was\r\nreally well off. My employment was to run errands, and to take care of\r\nTommy; to prevent his getting in the way of carriages, and to keep him\r\nout of harm’s way generally. Tommy, and I, and his mother, got on\r\nswimmingly together, for a time. I say _for a time_, because the fatal\r\npoison of irresponsible power, and the natural influence of slavery\r\ncustoms, were not long in making a suitable impression on the gentle\r\nand loving disposition of my excellent mistress. At first, Mrs. Auld\r\nevidently regarded me simply as a child, like any other child; she had\r\nnot come to regard me as _property_. This latter thought was a thing of\r\nconventional growth. The first was natural and spontaneous. A noble\r\nnature, like hers, could not, instantly, be wholly perverted; and it\r\ntook several years to change the natural sweetness of her temper into\r\nfretful bitterness. In her worst estate, however, there were, during\r\nthe first seven years I lived with her, occasional returns of her\r\nformer kindly disposition.\r\n\r\nThe frequent hearing of my mistress reading the bible for she often\r\nread aloud when her husband was absent soon awakened my curiosity in\r\nrespect to this _mystery_ of reading, and roused in me the desire to\r\nlearn. Having no fear of my kind mistress before my eyes, (she had then\r\ngiven me no reason to fear,) I frankly asked her to teach me to read;\r\nand, without hesitation, the dear woman began the task, and very soon,\r\nby her assistance, I was master of the alphabet, and could spell words\r\nof three or four letters. My mistress seemed almost as proud of my\r\nprogress, as if I had been her own child; and, supposing that her\r\nhusband would be as well pleased, she made no secret of what she was\r\ndoing for me. Indeed, she exultingly told him of the aptness of her\r\npupil, of her intention to persevere in teaching me, and of the duty\r\nwhich she felt it to teach me, at least to read _the bible_. Here arose\r\nthe first cloud over my Baltimore prospects, the precursor of drenching\r\nrains and chilling blasts.\r\n\r\nMaster Hugh was amazed at the simplicity of his spouse, and, probably\r\nfor the first time, he unfolded to her the true philosophy of slavery,\r\nand the peculiar rules necessary to be observed by masters and\r\nmistresses, in the management of their human chattels. Mr. Auld\r\npromptly forbade continuance of her instruction; telling her, in the\r\nfirst place, that the thing itself was unlawful; that it was also\r\nunsafe, and could only lead to mischief. To use his own words, further,\r\nhe said, “if you give a nigger an inch, he will take an ell;” “he\r\nshould know nothing but the will of his master, and learn to obey it.”\r\n“if you teach that nigger—speaking of myself—how to read the bible,\r\nthere will be no keeping him;” “it would forever unfit him for the\r\nduties of a slave;” and “as to himself, learning would do him no good,\r\nbut probably, a great deal of harm—making him disconsolate and\r\nunhappy.” “If you learn him now to read, he’ll want to know how to\r\nwrite; and, this accomplished, he’ll be running away with himself.”\r\nSuch was the tenor of Master Hugh’s oracular exposition of the true\r\nphilosophy of training a human chattel; and it must be confessed that\r\nhe very clearly comprehended the nature and the requirements of the\r\nrelation of master and slave. His discourse was the first decidedly\r\nanti-slavery lecture to which it had been my lot to listen. Mrs. Auld\r\nevidently felt the force of his remarks; and, like an obedient wife,\r\nbegan to shape her course in the direction indicated by her husband.\r\nThe effect of his words, _on me_, was neither slight nor transitory.\r\nHis iron sentences—cold and harsh—sunk deep into my heart, and stirred\r\nup not only my feelings into a sort of rebellion, but awakened within\r\nme a slumbering train of vital thought. It was a new and special\r\nrevelation, dispelling a painful mystery, against which my youthful\r\nunderstanding had struggled, and struggled in vain, to wit: the _white_\r\nman’s power to perpetuate the enslavement of the _black_ man. “Very\r\nwell,” thought I; “knowledge unfits a child to be a slave.” I\r\ninstinctively assented to the proposition; and from that moment I\r\nunderstood the direct pathway from slavery to freedom. This was just\r\nwhat I needed; and I got it at a time, and from a source, whence I\r\nleast expected it. I was saddened at the thought of losing the\r\nassistance of my kind mistress; but the information, so instantly\r\nderived, to some extent compensated me for the loss I had sustained in\r\nthis direction. Wise as Mr. Auld was, he evidently underrated my\r\ncomprehension, and had little idea of the use to which I was capable of\r\nputting the impressive lesson he was giving to his wife. _He_ wanted me\r\nto be _a slave;_ I had already voted against that on the home\r\nplantation of Col. Lloyd. That which he most loved I most hated; and\r\nthe very determination which he expressed to keep me in ignorance, only\r\nrendered me the more resolute in seeking intelligence. In learning to\r\nread, therefore, I am not sure that I do not owe quite as much to the\r\nopposition of my master, as to the kindly assistance of my amiable\r\nmistress. I acknowledge the benefit rendered me by the one, and by the\r\nother; believing, that but for my mistress, I might have grown up in\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nI had resided but a short time in Baltimore, before I observed a marked\r\ndifference in the manner of treating slaves, generally, from which I\r\nhad witnessed in that isolated and out-of-the-way part of the country\r\nwhere I began life. A city slave is almost a free citizen, in\r\nBaltimore, compared with a slave on Col. Lloyd’s plantation. He is much\r\nbetter fed and clothed, is less dejected in his appearance, and enjoys\r\nprivileges altogether unknown to the whip-driven slave on the\r\nplantation. Slavery dislikes a dense population, in which there is a\r\nmajority of non-slaveholders. The general sense of decency that must\r\npervade such a population, does much to check and prevent those\r\noutbreaks of atrocious cruelty, and those dark crimes without a name,\r\nalmost openly perpetrated on the plantation. He is a desperate\r\nslaveholder who will shock the humanity of his non-slaveholding\r\nneighbors, by the cries of the lacerated slaves; and very few in the\r\ncity are willing to incur the odium of being cruel masters. I found, in\r\nBaltimore, that no man was more odious to the white, as well as to the\r\ncolored people, than he, who had the reputation of starving his slaves.\r\nWork them, flog them, if need be, but don’t starve them. These are,\r\nhowever, some painful exceptions to this rule. While it is quite true\r\nthat most of the slaveholders in Baltimore feed and clothe their slaves\r\nwell, there are others who keep up their country cruelties in the city.\r\n\r\nAn instance of this sort is furnished in the case of a family who lived\r\ndirectly opposite to our house, and were named Hamilton. Mrs. Hamilton\r\nowned two slaves. Their names were Henrietta and Mary. They had always\r\nbeen house slaves. One was aged about twenty-two, and the other about\r\nfourteen. They were a fragile couple by nature, and the treatment they\r\nreceived was enough to break down the constitution of a horse. Of all\r\nthe dejected, emaciated, mangled and excoriated creatures I ever saw,\r\nthose two girls—in the refined, church going and Christian city of\r\nBaltimore were the most deplorable. Of stone must that heart be made,\r\nthat could look upon Henrietta and Mary, without being sickened to the\r\ncore with sadness. Especially was Mary a heart-sickening object. Her\r\nhead, neck and shoulders, were literally cut to pieces. I have\r\nfrequently felt her head, and found it nearly covered over with\r\nfestering sores, caused by the lash of her cruel mistress. I do not\r\nknow that her master ever whipped her, but I have often been an eye\r\nwitness of the revolting and brutal inflictions by Mrs. Hamilton; and\r\nwhat lends a deeper shade to this woman’s conduct, is the fact, that,\r\nalmost in the very moments of her shocking outrages of humanity and\r\ndecency, she would charm you by the sweetness of her voice and her\r\nseeming piety. She used to sit in a large rocking chair, near the\r\nmiddle of the room, with a heavy cowskin, such as I have elsewhere\r\ndescribed; and I speak within the truth when I say, that these girls\r\nseldom passed that chair, during the day, without a blow from that\r\ncowskin, either upon their bare arms, or upon their shoulders. As they\r\npassed her, she would draw her cowskin and give them a blow, saying,\r\n_“move faster, you black jip!”_ and, again, _“take that, you black\r\njip!”_ continuing, _“if you don’t move faster, I will give you more.”_\r\nThen the lady would go on, singing her sweet hymns, as though her\r\n_righteous_ soul were sighing for the holy realms of paradise.\r\n\r\nAdded to the cruel lashings to which these poor slave-girls were\r\nsubjected—enough in themselves to crush the spirit of men—they were,\r\nreally, kept nearly half starved; they seldom knew what it was to eat a\r\nfull meal, except when they got it in the kitchens of neighbors, less\r\nmean and stingy than the psalm-singing Mrs. Hamilton. I have seen poor\r\nMary contending for the offal, with the pigs in the street. So much was\r\nthe poor girl pinched, kicked, cut and pecked to pieces, that the boys\r\nin the street knew her only by the name of _“pecked,”_ a name derived\r\nfrom the scars and blotches on her neck, head and shoulders.\r\n\r\nIt is some relief to this picture of slavery in Baltimore, to say—what\r\nis but the simple truth—that Mrs. Hamilton’s treatment of her slaves\r\nwas generally condemned, as disgraceful and shocking; but while I say\r\nthis, it must also be remembered, that the very parties who censured\r\nthe cruelty of Mrs. Hamilton, would have condemned and promptly\r\npunished any attempt to interfere with Mrs. Hamilton’s _right_ to cut\r\nand slash her slaves to pieces. There must be no force between the\r\nslave and the slaveholder, to restrain the power of the one, and\r\nprotect the weakness of the other; and the cruelty of Mrs. Hamilton is\r\nas justly chargeable to the upholders of the slave system, as\r\ndrunkenness is chargeable on those who, by precept and example, or by\r\nindifference, uphold the drinking system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. _“A Change Came O’er the Spirit of My Dream”_\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW I LEARNED TO READ—MY MISTRESS—HER SLAVEHOLDING DUTIES—THEIR\r\nDEPLORABLE EFFECTS UPON HER ORIGINALLY NOBLE NATURE—THE CONFLICT IN HER\r\nMIND—HER FINAL OPPOSITION TO MY LEARNING TO READ—TOO LATE—SHE HAD GIVEN\r\nME THE INCH, I WAS RESOLVED TO TAKE THE ELL—HOW I PURSUED MY\r\nEDUCATION—MY TUTORS—HOW I COMPENSATED THEM—WHAT PROGRESS I\r\nMADE—SLAVERY—WHAT I HEARD SAID ABOUT IT—THIRTEEN YEARS OLD—THE\r\n_Columbian Orator_—A RICH SCENE—A DIALOGUE—SPEECHES OF CHATHAM,\r\nSHERIDAN, PITT AND FOX—KNOWLEDGE EVER INCREASING—MY EYES\r\nOPENED—LIBERTY—HOW I PINED FOR IT—MY SADNESS—THE DISSATISFACTION OF MY\r\nPOOR MISTRESS—MY HATRED OF SLAVERY—ONE UPAS TREE OVERSHADOWED US BOTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nI lived in the family of Master Hugh, at Baltimore, seven years, during\r\nwhich time—as the almanac makers say of the weather—my condition was\r\nvariable. The most interesting feature of my history here, was my\r\nlearning to read and write, under somewhat marked disadvantages. In\r\nattaining this knowledge, I was compelled to resort to indirections by\r\nno means congenial to my nature, and which were really humiliating to\r\nme. My mistress—who, as the reader has already seen, had begun to teach\r\nme was suddenly checked in her benevolent design, by the strong advice\r\nof her husband. In faithful compliance with this advice, the good lady\r\nhad not only ceased to instruct me, herself, but had set her face as a\r\nflint against my learning to read by any means. It is due, however, to\r\nmy mistress to say, that she did not adopt this course in all its\r\nstringency at the first. She either thought it unnecessary, or she\r\nlacked the depravity indispensable to shutting me up in mental\r\ndarkness. It was, at least, necessary for her to have some training,\r\nand some hardening, in the exercise of the slaveholder’s prerogative,\r\nto make her equal to forgetting my human nature and character, and to\r\ntreating me as a thing destitute of a moral or an intellectual nature.\r\nMrs. Auld—my mistress—was, as I have said, a most kind and\r\ntender-hearted woman; and, in the humanity of her heart, and the\r\nsimplicity of her mind, she set out, when I first went to live with\r\nher, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see, that, in entering upon the duties of a slaveholder,\r\nsome little experience is needed. Nature has done almost nothing to\r\nprepare men and women to be either slaves or slaveholders. Nothing but\r\nrigid training, long persisted in, can perfect the character of the one\r\nor the other. One cannot easily forget to love freedom; and it is as\r\nhard to cease to respect that natural love in our fellow creatures. On\r\nentering upon the career of a slaveholding mistress, Mrs. Auld was\r\nsingularly deficient; nature, which fits nobody for such an office, had\r\ndone less for her than any lady I had known. It was no easy matter to\r\ninduce her to think and to feel that the curly-headed boy, who stood by\r\nher side, and even leaned on her lap; who was loved by little Tommy,\r\nand who loved little Tommy in turn; sustained to her only the relation\r\nof a chattel. I was _more_ than that, and she felt me to be more than\r\nthat. I could talk and sing; I could laugh and weep; I could reason and\r\nremember; I could love and hate. I was human, and she, dear lady, knew\r\nand felt me to be so. How could she, then, treat me as a brute, without\r\na mighty struggle with all the noble powers of her own soul. That\r\nstruggle came, and the will and power of the husband was victorious.\r\nHer noble soul was overthrown; but, he that overthrew it did not,\r\nhimself, escape the consequences. He, not less than the other parties,\r\nwas injured in his domestic peace by the fall.\r\n\r\nWhen I went into their family, it was the abode of happiness and\r\ncontentment. The mistress of the house was a model of affection and\r\ntenderness. Her fervent piety and watchful uprightness made it\r\nimpossible to see her without thinking and feeling—“_that woman is a\r\nChristian_.” There was no sorrow nor suffering for which she had not a\r\ntear, and there was no innocent joy for which she did not a smile. She\r\nhad bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every\r\nmourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability to\r\ndivest her of these excellent qualities, and her home of its early\r\nhappiness. Conscience cannot stand much violence. Once thoroughly\r\nbroken down, _who_ is he that can repair the damage? It may be broken\r\ntoward the slave, on Sunday, and toward the master on Monday. It cannot\r\nendure such shocks. It must stand entire, or it does not stand at all.\r\nIf my condition waxed bad, that of the family waxed not better. The\r\nfirst step, in the wrong direction, was the violence done to nature and\r\nto conscience, in arresting the benevolence that would have enlightened\r\nmy young mind. In ceasing to instruct me, she must begin to justify\r\nherself _to_ herself; and, once consenting to take sides in such a\r\ndebate, she was riveted to her position. One needs very little\r\nknowledge of moral philosophy, to see _where_ my mistress now landed.\r\nShe finally became even more violent in her opposition to my learning\r\nto read, than was her husband himself. She was not satisfied with\r\nsimply doing as _well_ as her husband had commanded her, but seemed\r\nresolved to better his instruction. Nothing appeared to make my poor\r\nmistress—after her turning toward the downward path—more angry, than\r\nseeing me, seated in some nook or corner, quietly reading a book or a\r\nnewspaper. I have had her rush at me, with the utmost fury, and snatch\r\nfrom my hand such newspaper or book, with something of the wrath and\r\nconsternation which a traitor might be supposed to feel on being\r\ndiscovered in a plot by some dangerous spy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Auld was an apt woman, and the advice of her husband, and her own\r\nexperience, soon demonstrated, to her entire satisfaction, that\r\neducation and slavery are incompatible with each other. When this\r\nconviction was thoroughly established, I was most narrowly watched in\r\nall my movements. If I remained in a separate room from the family for\r\nany considerable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of having a\r\nbook, and was at once called upon to give an account of myself. All\r\nthis, however, was entirely _too late_. The first, and never to be\r\nretraced, step had been taken. In teaching me the alphabet, in the days\r\nof her simplicity and kindness, my mistress had given me the _“inch,”_\r\nand now, no ordinary precaution could prevent me from taking the\r\n_“ell.”_\r\n\r\nSeized with a determination to learn to read, at any cost, I hit upon\r\nmany expedients to accomplish the desired end. The plea which I mainly\r\nadopted, and the one by which I was most successful, was that of using\r\nmy young white playmates, with whom I met in the streets as teachers. I\r\nused to carry, almost constantly, a copy of Webster’s spelling book in\r\nmy pocket; and, when sent of errands, or when play time was allowed me,\r\nI would step, with my young friends, aside, and take a lesson in\r\nspelling. I generally paid my _tuition fee_ to the boys, with bread,\r\nwhich I also carried in my pocket. For a single biscuit, any of my\r\nhungry little comrades would give me a lesson more valuable to me than\r\nbread. Not every one, however, demanded this consideration, for there\r\nwere those who took pleasure in teaching me, whenever I had a chance to\r\nbe taught by them. I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or\r\nthree of those little boys, as a slight testimonial of the gratitude\r\nand affection I bear them, but prudence forbids; not that it would\r\ninjure me, but it might, possibly, embarrass them; for it is almost an\r\nunpardonable offense to do any thing, directly or indirectly, to\r\npromote a slave’s freedom, in a slave state. It is enough to say, of my\r\nwarm-hearted little play fellows, that they lived on Philpot street,\r\nvery near Durgin & Bailey’s shipyard.\r\n\r\nAlthough slavery was a delicate subject, and very cautiously talked\r\nabout among grown up people in Maryland, I frequently talked about\r\nit—and that very freely—with the white boys. I would, sometimes, say to\r\nthem, while seated on a curb stone or a cellar door, “I wish I could be\r\nfree, as you will be when you get to be men.” “You will be free, you\r\nknow, as soon as you are twenty-one, and can go where you like, but I\r\nam a slave for life. Have I not as good a right to be free as you\r\nhave?” Words like these, I observed, always troubled them; and I had no\r\nsmall satisfaction in wringing from the boys, occasionally, that fresh\r\nand bitter condemnation of slavery, that springs from nature, unseared\r\nand unperverted. Of all consciences let me have those to deal with\r\nwhich have not been bewildered by the cares of life. I do not remember\r\never to have met with a _boy_, while I was in slavery, who defended the\r\nslave system; but I have often had boys to console me, with the hope\r\nthat something would yet occur, by which I might be made free. Over and\r\nover again, they have told me, that “they believed I had as good a\r\nright to be free as _they_ had;” and that “they did not believe God\r\never made any one to be a slave.” The reader will easily see, that such\r\nlittle conversations with my play fellows, had no tendency to weaken my\r\nlove of liberty, nor to render me contented with my condition as a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nWhen I was about thirteen years old, and had succeeded in learning to\r\nread, every increase of knowledge, especially respecting the FREE\r\nSTATES, added something to the almost intolerable burden of the\r\nthought—I AM A SLAVE FOR LIFE. To my bondage I saw no end. It was a\r\nterrible reality, and I shall never be able to tell how sadly that\r\nthought chafed my young spirit. Fortunately, or unfortunately, about\r\nthis time in my life, I had made enough money to buy what was then a\r\nvery popular school book, viz: the _Columbian Orator_. I bought this\r\naddition to my library, of Mr. Knight, on Thames street, Fell’s Point,\r\nBaltimore, and paid him fifty cents for it. I was first led to buy this\r\nbook, by hearing some little boys say they were going to learn some\r\nlittle pieces out of it for the Exhibition. This volume was, indeed, a\r\nrich treasure, and every opportunity afforded me, for a time, was spent\r\nin diligently perusing it. Among much other interesting matter, that\r\nwhich I had perused and reperused with unflagging satisfaction, was a\r\nshort dialogue between a master and his slave. The slave is represented\r\nas having been recaptured, in a second attempt to run away; and the\r\nmaster opens the dialogue with an upbraiding speech, charging the slave\r\nwith ingratitude, and demanding to know what he has to say in his own\r\ndefense. Thus upbraided, and thus called upon to reply, the slave\r\nrejoins, that he knows how little anything that he can say will avail,\r\nseeing that he is completely in the hands of his owner; and with noble\r\nresolution, calmly says, “I submit to my fate.” Touched by the slave’s\r\nanswer, the master insists upon his further speaking, and recapitulates\r\nthe many acts of kindness which he has performed toward the slave, and\r\ntells him he is permitted to speak for himself. Thus invited to the\r\ndebate, the quondam slave made a spirited defense of himself, and\r\nthereafter the whole argument, for and against slavery, was brought\r\nout. The master was vanquished at every turn in the argument; and\r\nseeing himself to be thus vanquished, he generously and meekly\r\nemancipates the slave, with his best wishes for his prosperity. It is\r\nscarcely neccessary(sic) to say, that a dialogue, with such an origin,\r\nand such an ending—read when the fact of my being a slave was a\r\nconstant burden of grief—powerfully affected me; and I could not help\r\nfeeling that the day might come, when the well-directed answers made by\r\nthe slave to the master, in this instance, would find their counterpart\r\nin myself.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not all the fanaticism which I found in this\r\n_Columbian Orator_. I met there one of Sheridan’s mighty speeches, on\r\nthe subject of Catholic Emancipation, Lord Chatham’s speech on the\r\nAmerican war, and speeches by the great William Pitt and by Fox. These\r\nwere all choice documents to me, and I read them, over and over again,\r\nwith an interest that was ever increasing, because it was ever gaining\r\nin intelligence; for the more I read them, the better I understood\r\nthem. The reading of these speeches added much to my limited stock of\r\nlanguage, and enabled me to give tongue to many interesting thoughts,\r\nwhich had frequently flashed through my soul, and died away for want of\r\nutterance. The mighty power and heart-searching directness of truth,\r\npenetrating even the heart of a slaveholder, compelling him to yield up\r\nhis earthly interests to the claims of eternal justice, were finely\r\nillustrated in the dialogue, just referred to; and from the speeches of\r\nSheridan, I got a bold and powerful denunciation of oppression, and a\r\nmost brilliant vindication of the rights of man. Here was, indeed, a\r\nnoble acquisition. If I ever wavered under the consideration, that the\r\nAlmighty, in some way, ordained slavery, and willed my enslavement for\r\nhis own glory, I wavered no longer. I had now penetrated the secret of\r\nall slavery and oppression, and had ascertained their true foundation\r\nto be in the pride, the power and the avarice of man. The dialogue and\r\nthe speeches were all redolent of the principles of liberty, and poured\r\nfloods of light on the nature and character of slavery. With a book of\r\nthis kind in my hand, my own human nature, and the facts of my\r\nexperience, to help me, I was equal to a contest with the religious\r\nadvocates of slavery, whether among the whites or among the colored\r\npeople, for blindness, in this matter, is not confined to the former. I\r\nhave met many religious colored people, at the south, who are under the\r\ndelusion that God requires them to submit to slavery, and to wear their\r\nchains with meekness and humility. I could entertain no such nonsense\r\nas this; and I almost lost my patience when I found any colored man\r\nweak enough to believe such stuff. Nevertheless, the increase of\r\nknowledge was attended with bitter, as well as sweet results. The more\r\nI read, the more I was led to abhor and detest slavery, and my\r\nenslavers. “Slaveholders,” thought I, “are only a band of successful\r\nrobbers, who left their homes and went into Africa for the purpose of\r\nstealing and reducing my people to slavery.” I loathed them as the\r\nmeanest and the most wicked of men. As I read, behold! the very\r\ndiscontent so graphically predicted by Master Hugh, had already come\r\nupon me. I was no longer the light-hearted, gleesome boy, full of mirth\r\nand play, as when I landed first at Baltimore. Knowledge had come;\r\nlight had penetrated the moral dungeon where I dwelt; and, behold!\r\nthere lay the bloody whip, for my back, and here was the iron chain;\r\nand my good, _kind master_, he was the author of my situation. The\r\nrevelation haunted me, stung me, and made me gloomy and miserable. As I\r\nwrithed under the sting and torment of this knowledge, I almost envied\r\nmy fellow slaves their stupid contentment. This knowledge opened my\r\neyes to the horrible pit, and revealed the teeth of the frightful\r\ndragon that was ready to pounce upon me, but it opened no way for my\r\nescape. I have often wished myself a beast, or a bird—anything, rather\r\nthan a slave. I was wretched and gloomy, beyond my ability to describe.\r\nI was too thoughtful to be happy. It was this everlasting thinking\r\nwhich distressed and tormented me; and yet there was no getting rid of\r\nthe subject of my thoughts. All nature was redolent of it. Once\r\nawakened by the silver trump of knowledge, my spirit was roused to\r\neternal wakefulness. Liberty! the inestimable birthright of every man,\r\nhad, for me, converted every object into an asserter of this great\r\nright. It was heard in every sound, and beheld in every object. It was\r\never present, to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition. The\r\nmore beautiful and charming were the smiles of nature, the more\r\nhorrible and desolate was my condition. I saw nothing without seeing\r\nit, and I heard nothing without hearing it. I do not exaggerate, when I\r\nsay, that it looked from every star, smiled in every calm, breathed in\r\nevery wind, and moved in every storm.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that my state of mind had something to do with the\r\nchange in the treatment adopted, by my once kind mistress toward me. I\r\ncan easily believe, that my leaden, downcast, and discontented look,\r\nwas very offensive to her. Poor lady! She did not know my trouble, and\r\nI dared not tell her. Could I have freely made her acquainted with the\r\nreal state of my mind, and given her the reasons therefor, it might\r\nhave been well for both of us. Her abuse of me fell upon me like the\r\nblows of the false prophet upon his ass; she did not know that an\r\n_angel_ stood in the way; and—such is the relation of master and slave\r\nI could not tell her. Nature had made us _friends;_ slavery made us\r\n_enemies_. My interests were in a direction opposite to hers, and we\r\nboth had our private thoughts and plans. She aimed to keep me ignorant;\r\nand I resolved to know, although knowledge only increased my\r\ndiscontent. My feelings were not the result of any marked cruelty in\r\nthe treatment I received; they sprung from the consideration of my\r\nbeing a slave at all. It was _slavery_—not its mere _incidents_—that I\r\nhated. I had been cheated. I saw through the attempt to keep me in\r\nignorance; I saw that slaveholders would have gladly made me believe\r\nthat they were merely acting under the authority of God, in making a\r\nslave of me, and in making slaves of others; and I treated them as\r\nrobbers and deceivers. The feeding and clothing me well, could not\r\natone for taking my liberty from me. The smiles of my mistress could\r\nnot remove the deep sorrow that dwelt in my young bosom. Indeed, these,\r\nin time, came only to deepen my sorrow. She had changed; and the reader\r\nwill see that I had changed, too. We were both victims to the same\r\novershadowing evil—_she_, as mistress, I, as slave. I will not censure\r\nher harshly; she cannot censure me, for she knows I speak but the\r\ntruth, and have acted in my opposition to slavery, just as she herself\r\nwould have acted, in a reverse of circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. _Religious Nature Awakened_\r\n\r\n\r\nABOLITIONISTS SPOKEN OF—MY EAGERNESS TO KNOW WHAT THIS WORD MEANT—MY\r\nCONSULTATION OF THE DICTIONARY—INCENDIARY INFORMATION—HOW AND WHERE\r\nDERIVED—THE ENIGMA SOLVED—NATHANIEL TURNER’S INSURRECTION—THE\r\nCHOLERA—RELIGION—FIRST AWAKENED BY A METHODIST MINISTER NAMED HANSON—MY\r\nDEAR AND GOOD OLD COLORED FRIEND, LAWSON—HIS CHARACTER AND\r\nOCCUPATION—HIS INFLUENCE OVER ME—OUR MUTUAL ATTACHMENT—THE COMFORT I\r\nDERIVED FROM HIS TEACHING—NEW HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS—HEAVENLY LIGHT\r\nAMIDST EARTHLY DARKNESS—THE TWO IRISHMEN ON THE WHARF—THEIR\r\nCONVERSATION—HOW I LEARNED TO WRITE—WHAT WERE MY AIMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst in the painful state of mind described in the foregoing chapter,\r\nalmost regretting my very existence, because doomed to a life of\r\nbondage, so goaded and so wretched, at times, that I was even tempted\r\nto destroy my own life, I was keenly sensitive and eager to know any,\r\nand every thing that transpired, having any relation to the subject of\r\nslavery. I was all ears, all eyes, whenever the words _slave, slavery_,\r\ndropped from the lips of any white person, and the occasions were not\r\nunfrequent when these words became leading ones, in high, social\r\ndebate, at our house. Every little while, I could hear Master Hugh, or\r\nsome of his company, speaking with much warmth and excitement about\r\n_“abolitionists.”_ Of _who_ or _what_ these were, I was totally\r\nignorant. I found, however, that whatever they might be, they were most\r\ncordially hated and soundly abused by slaveholders, of every grade. I\r\nvery soon discovered, too, that slavery was, in some sort, under\r\nconsideration, whenever the abolitionists were alluded to. This made\r\nthe term a very interesting one to me. If a slave, for instance, had\r\nmade good his escape from slavery, it was generally alleged, that he\r\nhad been persuaded and assisted by the abolitionists. If, also, a slave\r\nkilled his master—as was sometimes the case—or struck down his\r\noverseer, or set fire to his master’s dwelling, or committed any\r\nviolence or crime, out of the common way, it was certain to be said,\r\nthat such a crime was the legitimate fruits of the abolition movement.\r\nHearing such charges often repeated, I, naturally enough, received the\r\nimpression that abolition—whatever else it might be—could not be\r\nunfriendly to the slave, nor very friendly to the slaveholder. I\r\ntherefore set about finding out, if possible, _who_ and _what_ the\r\nabolitionists were, and _why_ they were so obnoxious to the\r\nslaveholders. The dictionary afforded me very little help. It taught me\r\nthat abolition was the “act of abolishing;” but it left me in ignorance\r\nat the very point where I most wanted information—and that was, as to\r\nthe _thing_ to be abolished. A city newspaper, the _Baltimore\r\nAmerican_, gave me the incendiary information denied me by the\r\ndictionary. In its columns I found, that, on a certain day, a vast\r\nnumber of petitions and memorials had been presented to congress,\r\npraying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and\r\nfor the abolition of the slave trade between the states of the Union.\r\nThis was enough. The vindictive bitterness, the marked caution, the\r\nstudied reverse, and the cumbrous ambiguity, practiced by our white\r\nfolks, when alluding to this subject, was now fully explained. Ever,\r\nafter that, when I heard the words “abolition,” or “abolition\r\nmovement,” mentioned, I felt the matter one of a personal concern; and\r\nI drew near to listen, when I could do so, without seeming too\r\nsolicitous and prying. There was HOPE in those words. Ever and anon,\r\ntoo, I could see some terrible denunciation of slavery, in our\r\npapers—copied from abolition papers at the north—and the injustice of\r\nsuch denunciation commented on. These I read with avidity. I had a deep\r\nsatisfaction in the thought, that the rascality of slaveholders was not\r\nconcealed from the eyes of the world, and that I was not alone in\r\nabhorring the cruelty and brutality of slavery. A still deeper train of\r\nthought was stirred. I saw that there was _fear_, as well as _rage_, in\r\nthe manner of speaking of the abolitionists. The latter, therefore, I\r\nwas compelled to regard as having some power in the country; and I felt\r\nthat they might, possibly, succeed in their designs. When I met with a\r\nslave to whom I deemed it safe to talk on the subject, I would impart\r\nto him so much of the mystery as I had been able to penetrate. Thus,\r\nthe light of this grand movement broke in upon my mind, by degrees; and\r\nI must say, that, ignorant as I then was of the philosophy of that\r\nmovement, I believe in it from the first—and I believed in it, partly,\r\nbecause I saw that it alarmed the consciences of slaveholders. The\r\ninsurrection of Nathaniel Turner had been quelled, but the alarm and\r\nterror had not subsided. The cholera was on its way, and the thought\r\nwas present, that God was angry with the white people because of their\r\nslaveholding wickedness, and, therefore, his judgments were abroad in\r\nthe land. It was impossible for me not to hope much from the abolition\r\nmovement, when I saw it supported by the Almighty, and armed with\r\nDEATH!\r\n\r\nPrevious to my contemplation of the anti-slavery movement, and its\r\nprobable results, my mind had been seriously awakened to the subject of\r\nreligion. I was not more than thirteen years old, when I felt the need\r\nof God, as a father and protector. My religious nature was awakened by\r\nthe preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson. He thought\r\nthat all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight\r\nof God; that they were, by nature, rebels against His government; and\r\nthat they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God, through\r\nChrist. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was\r\nrequired of me; but one thing I knew very well—I was wretched, and had\r\nno means of making myself otherwise. Moreover, I knew that I could pray\r\nfor light. I consulted a good colored man, named Charles Johnson; and,\r\nin tones of holy affection, he told me to pray, and what to pray for. I\r\nwas, for weeks, a poor, brokenhearted mourner, traveling through the\r\ndarkness and misery of doubts and fears. I finally found that change of\r\nheart which comes by “casting all one’s care” upon God, and by having\r\nfaith in Jesus Christ, as the Redeemer, Friend, and Savior of those who\r\ndiligently seek Him.\r\n\r\nAfter this, I saw the world in a new light. I seemed to live in a new\r\nworld, surrounded by new objects, and to be animated by new hopes and\r\ndesires. I loved all mankind—slaveholders not excepted; though I\r\nabhorred slavery more than ever. My great concern was, now, to have the\r\nworld converted. The desire for knowledge increased, and especially did\r\nI want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the bible. I have\r\ngathered scattered pages from this holy book, from the filthy street\r\ngutters of Baltimore, and washed and dried them, that in the moments of\r\nmy leisure, I might get a word or two of wisdom from them. While thus\r\nreligiously seeking knowledge, I became acquainted with a good old\r\ncolored man, named Lawson. A more devout man than he, I never saw. He\r\ndrove a dray for Mr. James Ramsey, the owner of a rope-walk on Fell’s\r\nPoint, Baltimore. This man not only prayed three time a day, but he\r\nprayed as he walked through the streets, at his work—on his dray\r\neverywhere. His life was a life of prayer, and his words (when he spoke\r\nto his friends,) were about a better world. Uncle Lawson lived near\r\nMaster Hugh’s house; and, becoming deeply attached to the old man, I\r\nwent often with him to prayer-meeting, and spent much of my leisure\r\ntime with him on Sunday. The old man could read a little, and I was a\r\ngreat help to him, in making out the hard words, for I was a better\r\nreader than he. I could teach him _“the letter,”_ but he could teach me\r\n_“the spirit;”_ and high, refreshing times we had together, in singing,\r\npraying and glorifying God. These meetings with Uncle Lawson went on\r\nfor a long time, without the knowledge of Master Hugh or my mistress.\r\nBoth knew, however, that I had become religious, and they seemed to\r\nrespect my conscientious piety. My mistress was still a professor of\r\nreligion, and belonged to class. Her leader was no less a person than\r\nthe Rev. Beverly Waugh, the presiding elder, and now one of the bishops\r\nof the Methodist Episcopal church. Mr. Waugh was then stationed over\r\nWilk street church. I am careful to state these facts, that the reader\r\nmay be able to form an idea of the precise influences which had to do\r\nwith shaping and directing my mind.\r\n\r\nIn view of the cares and anxieties incident to the life she was then\r\nleading, and, especially, in view of the separation from religious\r\nassociations to which she was subjected, my mistress had, as I have\r\nbefore stated, become lukewarm, and needed to be looked up by her\r\nleader. This brought Mr. Waugh to our house, and gave me an opportunity\r\nto hear him exhort and pray. But my chief instructor, in matters of\r\nreligion, was Uncle Lawson. He was my spiritual father; and I loved him\r\nintensely, and was at his house every chance I got.\r\n\r\nThis pleasure was not long allowed me. Master Hugh became averse to my\r\ngoing to Father Lawson’s, and threatened to whip me if I ever went\r\nthere again. I now felt myself persecuted by a wicked man; and I\r\n_would_ go to Father Lawson’s, notwithstanding the threat. The good old\r\nman had told me, that the “Lord had a great work for me to do;” and I\r\nmust prepare to do it; and that he had been shown that I must preach\r\nthe gospel. His words made a deep impression on my mind, and I verily\r\nfelt that some such work was before me, though I could not see _how_ I\r\nshould ever engage in its performance. “The good Lord,” he said, “would\r\nbring it to pass in his own good time,” and that I must go on reading\r\nand studying the scriptures. The advice and the suggestions of Uncle\r\nLawson, were not without their influence upon my character and destiny.\r\nHe threw my thoughts into a channel from which they have never entirely\r\ndiverged. He fanned my already intense love of knowledge into a flame,\r\nby assuring me that I was to be a useful man in the world. When I would\r\nsay to him, “How can these things be and what can _I_ do?” his simple\r\nreply was, _“Trust in the Lord.”_ When I told him that “I was a slave,\r\nand a slave FOR LIFE,” he said, “the Lord can make you free, my dear.\r\nAll things are possible with him, only _have faith in God.”_ “Ask, and\r\nit shall be given.” “If you want liberty,” said the good old man, “ask\r\nthe Lord for it, _in faith_, AND HE WILL GIVE IT TO YOU.”\r\n\r\nThus assured, and cheered on, under the inspiration of hope, I worked\r\nand prayed with a light heart, believing that my life was under the\r\nguidance of a wisdom higher than my own. With all other blessings\r\nsought at the mercy seat, I always prayed that God would, of His great\r\nmercy, and in His own good time, deliver me from my bondage.\r\n\r\nI went, one day, on the wharf of Mr. Waters; and seeing two Irishmen\r\nunloading a large scow of stone, or ballast I went on board, unasked,\r\nand helped them. When we had finished the work, one of the men came to\r\nme, aside, and asked me a number of questions, and among them, if I\r\nwere a slave. I told him “I was a slave, and a slave for life.” The\r\ngood Irishman gave his shoulders a shrug, and seemed deeply affected by\r\nthe statement. He said, “it was a pity so fine a little fellow as\r\nmyself should be a slave for life.” They both had much to say about the\r\nmatter, and expressed the deepest sympathy with me, and the most\r\ndecided hatred of slavery. They went so far as to tell me that I ought\r\nto run away, and go to the north; that I should find friends there, and\r\nthat I would be as free as anybody. I, however, pretended not to be\r\ninterested in what they said, for I feared they might be treacherous.\r\nWhite men have been known to encourage slaves to escape, and then—to\r\nget the reward—they have kidnapped them, and returned them to their\r\nmasters. And while I mainly inclined to the notion that these men were\r\nhonest and meant me no ill, I feared it might be otherwise. I\r\nnevertheless remembered their words and their advice, and looked\r\nforward to an escape to the north, as a possible means of gaining the\r\nliberty for which my heart panted. It was not my enslavement, at the\r\nthen present time, that most affected me; the being a slave _for life_,\r\nwas the saddest thought. I was too young to think of running away\r\nimmediately; besides, I wished to learn how to write, before going, as\r\nI might have occasion to write my own pass. I now not only had the hope\r\nof freedom, but a foreshadowing of the means by which I might, some\r\nday, gain that inestimable boon. Meanwhile, I resolved to add to my\r\neducational attainments the art of writing.\r\n\r\nAfter this manner I began to learn to write: I was much in the ship\r\nyard—Master Hugh’s, and that of Durgan & Bailey—and I observed that the\r\ncarpenters, after hewing and getting a piece of timber ready for use,\r\nwrote on it the initials of the name of that part of the ship for which\r\nit was intended. When, for instance, a piece of timber was ready for\r\nthe starboard side, it was marked with a capital “S.” A piece for the\r\nlarboard side was marked “L;” larboard forward, “L. F.;” larboard aft,\r\nwas marked “L. A.;” starboard aft, “S. A.;” and starboard forward “S.\r\nF.” I soon learned these letters, and for what they were placed on the\r\ntimbers.\r\n\r\nMy work was now, to keep fire under the steam box, and to watch the\r\nship yard while the carpenters had gone to dinner. This interval gave\r\nme a fine opportunity for copying the letters named. I soon astonished\r\nmyself with the ease with which I made the letters; and the thought was\r\nsoon present, “if I can make four, I can make more.” But having made\r\nthese easily, when I met boys about Bethel church, or any of our\r\nplay-grounds, I entered the lists with them in the art of writing, and\r\nwould make the letters which I had been so fortunate as to learn, and\r\nask them to “beat that if they could.” With playmates for my teachers,\r\nfences and pavements for my copy books, and chalk for my pen and ink, I\r\nlearned the art of writing. I, however, afterward adopted various\r\nmethods of improving my hand. The most successful, was copying the\r\n_italics_ in Webster’s spelling book, until I could make them all\r\nwithout looking on the book. By this time, my little “Master Tommy” had\r\ngrown to be a big boy, and had written over a number of copy books, and\r\nbrought them home. They had been shown to the neighbors, had elicited\r\ndue praise, and were now laid carefully away. Spending my time between\r\nthe ship yard and house, I was as often the lone keeper of the latter\r\nas of the former. When my mistress left me in charge of the house, I\r\nhad a grand time; I got Master Tommy’s copy books and a pen and ink,\r\nand, in the ample spaces between the lines, I wrote other lines, as\r\nnearly like his as possible. The process was a tedious one, and I ran\r\nthe risk of getting a flogging for marring the highly prized copy books\r\nof the oldest son. In addition to those opportunities, sleeping, as I\r\ndid, in the kitchen loft—a room seldom visited by any of the family—I\r\ngot a flour barrel up there, and a chair; and upon the head of that\r\nbarrel I have written (or endeavored to write) copying from the bible\r\nand the Methodist hymn book, and other books which had accumulated on\r\nmy hands, till late at night, and when all the family were in bed and\r\nasleep. I was supported in my endeavors by renewed advice, and by holy\r\npromises from the good Father Lawson, with whom I continued to meet,\r\nand pray, and read the scriptures. Although Master Hugh was aware of my\r\ngoing there, I must say, for his credit, that he never executed his\r\nthreat to whip me, for having thus, innocently, employed-my leisure\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. _The Vicissitudes of Slave Life_\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF OLD MASTER’S SON RICHARD, SPEEDILY FOLLOWED BY THAT OF OLD\r\nMASTER—VALUATION AND DIVISION OF ALL THE PROPERTY, INCLUDING THE\r\nSLAVES—MY PRESENCE REQUIRED AT HILLSBOROUGH TO BE APPRAISED AND\r\nALLOTTED TO A NEW OWNER—MY SAD PROSPECTS AND GRIEF—PARTING—THE UTTER\r\nPOWERLESSNESS OF THE SLAVES TO DECIDE THEIR OWN DESTINY—A GENERAL DREAD\r\nOF MASTER ANDREW—HIS WICKEDNESS AND CRUELTY—MISS LUCRETIA MY NEW\r\nOWNER—MY RETURN TO BALTIMORE—JOY UNDER THE ROOF OF MASTER HUGH—DEATH OF\r\nMRS.

Lloyd’s plantation, in _form_ the slave of Master Hugh, I was, in\r\n_fact_, and in _law_, the slave of my old master, Capt. Anthony. Very\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time after I went to Baltimore, my old master’s\r\nyoungest son, Richard, died; and, in three years and six months after\r\nhis death, my old master himself died, leaving only his son, Andrew,\r\nand his daughter, Lucretia, to share his estate. The old man died while\r\non a visit to his daughter, in Hillsborough, where Capt. Auld and Mrs.\r\nLucretia now lived. The former, having given up the command of Col.\r\nLloyd’s sloop, was now keeping a store in that town.\r\n\r\nCut off, thus unexpectedly, Capt. Anthony died intestate; and his\r\nproperty must now be equally divided between his two children, Andrew\r\nand Lucretia.\r\n\r\nThe valuation and the division of slaves, among contending heirs, is an\r\nimportant incident in slave life. The character and tendencies of the\r\nheirs, are generally well understood among the slaves who are to be\r\ndivided, and all have their aversions and preferences. But, neither\r\ntheir aversions nor their preferences avail them anything.\r\n\r\nOn the death of old master, I was immediately sent for, to be valued\r\nand divided with the other property. Personally, my concern was,\r\nmainly, about my possible removal from the home of Master Hugh, which,\r\nafter that of my grandmother, was the most endeared to me. But, the\r\nwhole thing, as a feature of slavery, shocked me. It furnished me anew\r\ninsight into the unnatural power to which I was subjected. My\r\ndetestation of slavery, already great, rose with this new conception of\r\nits enormity.\r\n\r\nThat was a sad day for me, a sad day for little Tommy, and a sad day\r\nfor my dear Baltimore mistress and teacher, when I left for the Eastern\r\nShore, to be valued and divided. We, all three, wept bitterly that day;\r\nfor we might be parting, and we feared we were parting, forever. No one\r\ncould tell among which pile of chattels I should be flung. Thus early,\r\nI got a foretaste of that painful uncertainty which slavery brings to\r\nthe ordinary lot of mortals. Sickness, adversity and death may\r\ninterfere with the plans and purposes of all; but the slave has the\r\nadded danger of changing homes, changing hands, and of having\r\nseparations unknown to other men. Then, too, there was the intensified\r\ndegradation of the spectacle. What an assemblage! Men and women, young\r\nand old, married and single; moral and intellectual beings, in open\r\ncontempt of their humanity, level at a blow with horses, sheep, horned\r\ncattle and swine! Horses and men—cattle and women—pigs and children—all\r\nholding the same rank in the scale of social existence; and all\r\nsubjected to the same narrow inspection, to ascertain their value in\r\ngold and silver—the only standard of worth applied by slaveholders to\r\nslaves! How vividly, at that moment, did the brutalizing power of\r\nslavery flash before me! Personality swallowed up in the sordid idea of\r\nproperty! Manhood lost in chattelhood!\r\n\r\nAfter the valuation, then came the division. This was an hour of high\r\nexcitement and distressing anxiety. Our destiny was now to be _fixed\r\nfor life_, and we had no more voice in the decision of the question,\r\nthan the oxen and cows that stood chewing at the haymow. One word from\r\nthe appraisers, against all preferences or prayers, was enough to\r\nsunder all the ties of friendship and affection, and even to separate\r\nhusbands and wives, parents and children. We were all appalled before\r\nthat power, which, to human seeming, could bless or blast us in a\r\nmoment. Added to the dread of separation, most painful to the majority\r\nof the slaves, we all had a decided horror of the thought of falling\r\ninto the hands of Master Andrew. He was distinguished for cruelty and\r\nintemperance.\r\n\r\nSlaves generally dread to fall into the hands of drunken owners. Master\r\nAndrew was almost a confirmed sot, and had already, by his reckless\r\nmismanagement and profligate dissipation, wasted a large portion of old\r\nmaster’s property. To fall into his hands, was, therefore, considered\r\nmerely as the first step toward being sold away to the far south. He\r\nwould spend his fortune in a few years, and his farms and slaves would\r\nbe sold, we thought, at public outcry; and we should be hurried away to\r\nthe cotton fields, and rice swamps, of the sunny south. This was the\r\ncause of deep consternation.\r\n\r\nThe people of the north, and free people generally, I think, have less\r\nattachment to the places where they are born and brought up, than have\r\nthe slaves. Their freedom to go and come, to be here and there, as they\r\nlist, prevents any extravagant attachment to any one particular place,\r\nin their case. On the other hand, the slave is a fixture; he has no\r\nchoice, no goal, no destination; but is pegged down to a single spot,\r\nand must take root here, or nowhere. The idea of removal elsewhere,\r\ncomes, generally, in the shape of a threat, and in punishment of crime.\r\nIt is, therefore, attended with fear and dread. A slave seldom thinks\r\nof bettering his condition by being sold, and hence he looks upon\r\nseparation from his native place, with none of the enthusiasm which\r\nanimates the bosoms of young freemen, when they contemplate a life in\r\nthe far west, or in some distant country where they intend to rise to\r\nwealth and distinction. Nor can those from whom they separate, give\r\nthem up with that cheerfulness with which friends and relations yield\r\neach other up, when they feel that it is for the good of the departing\r\none that he is removed from his native place. Then, too, there is\r\ncorrespondence, and there is, at least, the hope of reunion, because\r\nreunion is _possible_. But, with the slave, all these mitigating\r\ncircumstances are wanting. There is no improvement in his condition\r\n_probable_,—no correspondence _possible_,—no reunion attainable. His\r\ngoing out into the world, is like a living man going into the tomb,\r\nwho, with open eyes, sees himself buried out of sight and hearing of\r\nwife, children and friends of kindred tie.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the likelihoods and possibilities of our\r\ncircumstances, I probably suffered more than most of my fellow\r\nservants. I had known what it was to experience kind, and even tender\r\ntreatment; they had known nothing of the sort. Life, to them, had been\r\nrough and thorny, as well as dark. They had—most of them—lived on my\r\nold master’s farm in Tuckahoe, and had felt the reign of Mr. Plummer’s\r\nrule. The overseer had written his character on the living parchment of\r\nmost of their backs, and left them callous; my back (thanks to my early\r\nremoval from the plantation to Baltimore) was yet tender. I had left a\r\nkind mistress at Baltimore, who was almost a mother to me. She was in\r\ntears when we parted, and the probabilities of ever seeing her again,\r\ntrembling in the balance as they did, could not be viewed without alarm\r\nand agony. The thought of leaving that kind mistress forever, and,\r\nworse still, of being the slave of Andrew Anthony—a man who, but a few\r\ndays before the division of the property, had, in my presence, seized\r\nmy brother Perry by the throat, dashed him on the ground, and with the\r\nheel of his boot stamped him on the head, until the blood gushed from\r\nhis nose and ears—was terrible! This fiendish proceeding had no better\r\napology than the fact, that Perry had gone to play, when Master Andrew\r\nwanted him for some trifling service. This cruelty, too, was of a piece\r\nwith his general character. After inflicting his heavy blows on my\r\nbrother, on observing me looking at him with intense astonishment, he\r\nsaid, “_That_ is the way I will serve you, one of these days;” meaning,\r\nno doubt, when I should come into his possession. This threat, the\r\nreader may well suppose, was not very tranquilizing to my feelings. I\r\ncould see that he really thirsted to get hold of me. But I was there\r\nonly for a few days. I had not received any orders, and had violated\r\nnone, and there was, therefore, no excuse for flogging me.\r\n\r\nAt last, the anxiety and suspense were ended; and they ended, thanks to\r\na kind Providence, in accordance with my wishes. I fell to the portion\r\nof Mrs. Lucretia—the dear lady who bound up my head, when the savage\r\nAunt Katy was adding to my sufferings her bitterest maledictions.\r\n\r\nCapt. Thomas Auld and Mrs. Lucretia at once decided on my return to\r\nBaltimore. They knew how sincerely and warmly Mrs. Hugh Auld was\r\nattached to me, and how delighted Mr. Hugh’s son would be to have me\r\nback; and, withal, having no immediate use for one so young, they\r\nwillingly let me off to Baltimore.\r\n\r\nI need not stop here to narrate my joy on returning to Baltimore, nor\r\nthat of little Tommy; nor the tearful joy of his mother; nor the\r\nevident saticfaction(sic) of Master Hugh. I was just one month absent\r\nfrom Baltimore, before the matter was decided; and the time really\r\nseemed full six months.\r\n\r\nOne trouble over, and on comes another. The slave’s life is full of\r\nuncertainty. I had returned to Baltimore but a short time, when the\r\ntidings reached me, that my friend, Mrs. Lucretia, who was only second\r\nin my regard to Mrs. Hugh Auld, was dead, leaving her husband and only\r\none child—a daughter, named Amanda.\r\n\r\nShortly after the death of Mrs. Lucretia, strange to say, Master Andrew\r\ndied, leaving his wife and one child. Thus, the whole family of\r\nAnthonys was swept away; only two children remained. All this happened\r\nwithin five years of my leaving Col. Lloyd’s.\r\n\r\nNo alteration took place in the condition of the slaves, in consequence\r\nof these deaths, yet I could not help feeling less secure, after the\r\ndeath of my friend, Mrs. Lucretia, than I had done during her life.\r\nWhile she lived, I felt that I had a strong friend to plead for me in\r\nany emergency. Ten years ago, while speaking of the state of things in\r\nour family, after the events just named, I used this language:\r\n\r\nNow all the property of my old master, slaves included, was in the\r\nhands of strangers—strangers who had nothing to do in accumulating it.\r\nNot a slave was left free. All remained slaves, from youngest to\r\noldest. If any one thing in my experience, more than another, served to\r\ndeepen my conviction of the infernal character of slavery, and to fill\r\nme with unutterable loathing of slaveholders, it was their base\r\ningratitude to my poor old grandmother. She had served my old master\r\nfaithfully from youth to old age. She had been the source of all his\r\nwealth; she had peopled his plantation with slaves; she had become a\r\ngreat-grandmother in his service. She had rocked him in infancy,\r\nattended him in childhood, served him through life, and at his death\r\nwiped from his icy brow the cold death-sweat, and closed his eyes\r\nforever. She was nevertheless left a slave—a slave for life—a slave in\r\nthe hands of strangers; and in their hands she saw her children, her\r\ngrandchildren, and her great-grandchildren, divided, like so many\r\nsheep, without being gratified with the small privilege of a single\r\nword, as to their or her own destiny. And, to cap the climax of their\r\nbase ingratitude and fiendish barbarity, my grandmother, who was now\r\nvery old, having outlived my old master and all his children, having\r\nseen the beginning and end of all of them, and her present owners\r\nfinding she was of but little value, her frame already racked with the\r\npains of old age, and complete helplessness fast stealing over her once\r\nactive limbs, they took her to the woods, built her a little hut, put\r\nup a little mud-chimney, and then made her welcome to the privilege of\r\nsupporting herself there in perfect loneliness; thus virtually turning\r\nher out to die! If my poor old grandmother now lives, she lives to\r\nsuffer in utter loneliness; she lives to remember and mourn over the\r\nloss of children, the loss of grandchildren, and the loss of\r\ngreat-grandchildren. They are, in the language of the slave’s poet,\r\nWhittier—\r\n\r\nGone, gone, sold and gone,\r\nTo the rice swamp dank and lone,\r\nWhere the slave-whip ceaseless swings,\r\nWhere the noisome insect stings,\r\nWhere the fever-demon strews\r\nPoison with the falling dews,\r\nWhere the sickly sunbeams glare\r\nThrough the hot and misty air:—\r\n          Gone, gone, sold and gone\r\n          To the rice swamp dank and lone,\r\n          From Virginia hills and waters—\r\n          Woe is me, my stolen daughters!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hearth is desolate. The children, the unconscious children, who\r\nonce sang and danced in her presence, are gone. She gropes her way, in\r\nthe darkness of age, for a drink of water. Instead of the voices of her\r\nchildren, she hears by day the moans of the dove, and by night the\r\nscreams of the hideous owl. All is gloom. The grave is at the door. And\r\nnow, when weighed down by the pains and aches of old age, when the head\r\ninclines to the feet, when the beginning and ending of human existence\r\nmeet, and helpless infancy and painful old age combine together—at this\r\ntime, this most needful time, the time for the exercise of that\r\ntenderness and affection which children only can exercise toward a\r\ndeclining parent—my poor old grandmother, the devoted mother of twelve\r\nchildren, is left all alone, in yonder little hut, before a few dim\r\nembers.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the death of Mrs. Lucretia, Master Thomas married his\r\nsecond wife. Her name was Rowena Hamilton, the eldest daughter of Mr.\r\nWilliam Hamilton, a rich slaveholder on the Eastern Shore of Maryland,\r\nwho lived about five miles from St. Michael’s, the then place of my\r\nmaster’s residence.\r\n\r\nNot long after his marriage, Master Thomas had a misunderstanding with\r\nMaster Hugh, and, as a means of punishing his brother, he ordered him\r\nto send me home.\r\n\r\nAs the ground of misunderstanding will serve to illustrate the\r\ncharacter of southern chivalry, and humanity, I will relate it.\r\n\r\nAmong the children of my Aunt Milly, was a daughter, named Henny. When\r\nquite a child, Henny had fallen into the fire, and burnt her hands so\r\nbad that they were of very little use to her. Her fingers were drawn\r\nalmost into the palms of her hands. She could make out to do something,\r\nbut she was considered hardly worth the having—of little more value\r\nthan a horse with a broken leg. This unprofitable piece of human\r\nproperty, ill shapen, and disfigured, Capt. Auld sent off to Baltimore,\r\nmaking his brother Hugh welcome to her services.\r\n\r\nAfter giving poor Henny a fair trial, Master Hugh and his wife came to\r\nthe conclusion, that they had no use for the crippled servant, and they\r\nsent her back to Master Thomas. Thus, the latter took as an act of\r\ningratitude, on the part of his brother; and, as a mark of his\r\ndispleasure, he required him to send me immediately to St. Michael’s,\r\nsaying, if he cannot keep _“Hen,”_ he shall not have _“Fred.”_\r\n\r\nHere was another shock to my nerves, another breaking up of my plans,\r\nand another severance of my religious and social alliances. I was now a\r\nbig boy. I had become quite useful to several young colored men, who\r\nhad made me their teacher. I had taught some of them to read, and was\r\naccustomed to spend many of my leisure hours with them. Our attachment\r\nwas strong, and I greatly dreaded the separation. But regrets,\r\nespecially in a slave, are unavailing. I was only a slave; my wishes\r\nwere nothing, and my happiness was the sport of my masters.\r\n\r\nMy regrets at now leaving Baltimore, were not for the same reasons as\r\nwhen I before left that city, to be valued and handed over to my proper\r\nowner. My home was not now the pleasant place it had formerly been. A\r\nchange had taken place, both in Master Hugh, and in his once pious and\r\naffectionate wife. The influence of brandy and bad company on him, and\r\nthe influence of slavery and social isolation upon her, had wrought\r\ndisastrously upon the characters of both. Thomas was no longer “little\r\nTommy,” but was a big boy, and had learned to assume the airs of his\r\nclass toward me. My condition, therefore, in the house of Master Hugh,\r\nwas not, by any means, so comfortable as in former years. My\r\nattachments were now outside of our family. They were felt to those to\r\nwhom I _imparted_ instruction, and to those little white boys from whom\r\nI _received_ instruction. There, too, was my dear old father, the pious\r\nLawson, who was, in christian graces, the very counterpart of “Uncle”\r\nTom. The resemblance is so perfect, that he might have been the\r\noriginal of Mrs. Stowe’s christian hero. The thought of leaving these\r\ndear friends, greatly troubled me, for I was going without the hope of\r\never returning to Baltimore again; the feud between Master Hugh and his\r\nbrother being bitter and irreconcilable, or, at least, supposed to be\r\nso.\r\n\r\nIn addition to thoughts of friends from whom I was parting, as I\r\nsupposed, _forever_, I had the grief of neglected chances of escape to\r\nbrood over. I had put off running away, until now I was to be placed\r\nwhere the opportunities for escaping were much fewer than in a large\r\ncity like Baltimore.\r\n\r\nOn my way from Baltimore to St. Michael’s, down the Chesapeake bay, our\r\nsloop—the “Amanda”—was passed by the steamers plying between that city\r\nand Philadelphia, and I watched the course of those steamers, and,\r\nwhile going to St. Michael’s, I formed a plan to escape from slavery;\r\nof which plan, and matters connected therewith the kind reader shall\r\nlearn more hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. _Experience in St. Michael’s_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE—ITS INHABITANTS—THEIR OCCUPATION AND LOW PROPENSITIES\r\nCAPTAN(sic) THOMAS AULD—HIS CHARACTER—HIS SECOND WIFE, ROWENA—WELL\r\nMATCHED—SUFFERINGS FROM HUNGER—OBLIGED TO TAKE FOOD—MODE OF ARGUMENT IN\r\nVINDICATION THEREOF—NO MORAL CODE OF FREE SOCIETY CAN APPLY TO SLAVE\r\nSOCIETY—SOUTHERN CAMP MEETING—WHAT MASTER THOMAS DID\r\nTHERE—HOPES—SUSPICIONS ABOUT HIS CONVERSION—THE RESULT—FAITH AND WORKS\r\nENTIRELY AT VARIANCE—HIS RISE AND PROGRESS IN THE CHURCH—POOR COUSIN\r\n“HENNY”—HIS TREATMENT OF HER—THE METHODIST PREACHERS—THEIR UTTER\r\nDISREGARD OF US—ONE EXCELLENT EXCEPTION—REV.

There were a few\r\ncomfortable dwellings in it, but the place, as a whole, wore a dull,\r\nslovenly, enterprise-forsaken aspect. The mass of the buildings were\r\nwood; they had never enjoyed the artificial adornment of paint, and\r\ntime and storms had worn off the bright color of the wood, leaving them\r\nalmost as black as buildings charred by a conflagration.\r\n\r\nSt. Michael’s had, in former years, (previous to 1833, for that was the\r\nyear I went to reside there,) enjoyed some reputation as a ship\r\nbuilding community, but that business had almost entirely given place\r\nto oyster fishing, for the Baltimore and Philadelphia markets—a course\r\nof life highly unfavorable to morals, industry, and manners. Miles\r\nriver was broad, and its oyster fishing grounds were extensive; and the\r\nfishermen were out, often, all day, and a part of the night, during\r\nautumn, winter and spring. This exposure was an excuse for carrying\r\nwith them, in considerable quanties(sic), spirituous liquors, the then\r\nsupposed best antidote for cold. Each canoe was supplied with its jug\r\nof rum; and tippling, among this class of the citizens of St.\r\nMichael’s, became general. This drinking habit, in an ignorant\r\npopulation, fostered coarseness, vulgarity and an indolent disregard\r\nfor the social improvement of the place, so that it was admitted, by\r\nthe few sober, thinking people who remained there, that St. Michael’s\r\nhad become a very _unsaintly_, as well as unsightly place, before I\r\nwent there to reside.\r\n\r\nI left Baltimore for St. Michael’s in the month of March, 1833. I know\r\nthe year, because it was the one succeeding the first cholera in\r\nBaltimore, and was the year, also, of that strange phenomenon, when the\r\nheavens seemed about to part with its starry train. I witnessed this\r\ngorgeous spectacle, and was awe-struck. The air seemed filled with\r\nbright, descending messengers from the sky. It was about daybreak when\r\nI saw this sublime scene. I was not without the suggestion, at the\r\nmoment, that it might be the harbinger of the coming of the Son of Man;\r\nand, in my then state of mind, I was prepared to hail Him as my friend\r\nand deliverer. I had read, that the “stars shall fall from heaven”; and\r\nthey were now falling. I was suffering much in my mind. It did seem\r\nthat every time the young tendrils of my affection became attached,\r\nthey were rudely broken by some unnatural outside power; and I was\r\nbeginning to look away to heaven for the rest denied me on earth.\r\n\r\nBut, to my story. It was now more than seven years since I had lived\r\nwith Master Thomas Auld, in the family of my old master, on Col.\r\nLloyd’s plantation. We were almost entire strangers to each other; for,\r\nwhen I knew him at the house of my old master, it was not as a\r\n_master_, but simply as “Captain Auld,” who had married old master’s\r\ndaughter. All my lessons concerning his temper and disposition, and the\r\nbest methods of pleasing him, were yet to be learnt. Slaveholders,\r\nhowever, are not very ceremonious in approaching a slave; and my\r\nignorance of the new material in shape of a master was but transient.\r\nNor was my mistress long in making known her animus. She was not a\r\n“Miss Lucretia,” traces of whom I yet remembered, and the more\r\nespecially, as I saw them shining in the face of little Amanda, her\r\ndaughter, now living under a step-mother’s government. I had not\r\nforgotten the soft hand, guided by a tender heart, that bound up with\r\nhealing balsam the gash made in my head by Ike, the son of Abel. Thomas\r\nand Rowena, I found to be a well-matched pair. _He_ was stingy, and\r\n_she_ was cruel; and—what was quite natural in such cases—she possessed\r\nthe ability to make him as cruel as herself, while she could easily\r\ndescend to the level of his meanness. In the house of Master Thomas, I\r\nwas made—for the first time in seven years to feel the pinchings of\r\nhunger, and this was not very easy to bear.\r\n\r\nFor, in all the changes of Master Hugh’s family, there was no change in\r\nthe bountifulness with which they supplied me with food. Not to give a\r\nslave enough to eat, is meanness intensified, and it is so recognized\r\namong slaveholders generally, in Maryland. The rule is, no matter how\r\ncoarse the food, only let there be enough of it. This is the theory,\r\nand—in the part of Maryland I came from—the general practice accords\r\nwith this theory. Lloyd’s plantation was an exception, as was, also,\r\nthe house of Master Thomas Auld.\r\n\r\nAll know the lightness of Indian corn-meal, as an article of food, and\r\ncan easily judge from the following facts whether the statements I have\r\nmade of the stinginess of Master Thomas, are borne out. There were four\r\nslaves of us in the kitchen, and four whites in the great house Thomas\r\nAuld, Mrs. Auld, Hadaway Auld (brother of Thomas Auld) and little\r\nAmanda. The names of the slaves in the kitchen, were Eliza, my sister;\r\nPriscilla, my aunt; Henny, my cousin; and myself. There were eight\r\npersons in the family. There was, each week, one half bushel of\r\ncorn-meal brought from the mill; and in the kitchen, corn-meal was\r\nalmost our exclusive food, for very little else was allowed us. Out of\r\nthis bushel of corn-meal, the family in the great house had a small\r\nloaf every morning; thus leaving us, in the kitchen, with not quite a\r\nhalf a peck per week, apiece. This allowance was less than half the\r\nallowance of food on Lloyd’s plantation. It was not enough to subsist\r\nupon; and we were, therefore, reduced to the wretched necessity of\r\nliving at the expense of our neighbors. We were compelled either to\r\nbeg, or to steal, and we did both. I frankly confess, that while I\r\nhated everything like stealing, _as such_, I nevertheless did not\r\nhesitate to take food, when I was hungry, wherever I could find it. Nor\r\nwas this practice the mere result of an unreasoning instinct; it was,\r\nin my case, the result of a clear apprehension of the claims of\r\nmorality. I weighed and considered the matter closely, before I\r\nventured to satisfy my hunger by such means. Considering that my labor\r\nand person were the property of Master Thomas, and that I was by him\r\ndeprived of the necessaries of life necessaries obtained by my own\r\nlabor—it was easy to deduce the right to supply myself with what was my\r\nown. It was simply appropriating what was my own to the use of my\r\nmaster, since the health and strength derived from such food were\r\nexerted in _his_ service. To be sure, this was stealing, according to\r\nthe law and gospel I heard from St. Michael’s pulpit; but I had already\r\nbegun to attach less importance to what dropped from that quarter, on\r\nthat point, while, as yet, I retained my reverence for religion. It was\r\nnot always convenient to steal from master, and the same reason why I\r\nmight, innocently, steal from him, did not seem to justify me in\r\nstealing from others. In the case of my master, it was only a question\r\nof _removal_—the taking his meat out of one tub, and putting it into\r\nanother; the ownership of the meat was not affected by the transaction.\r\nAt first, he owned it in the _tub_, and last, he owned it in _me_. His\r\nmeat house was not always open. There was a strict watch kept on that\r\npoint, and the key was on a large bunch in Rowena’s pocket. A great\r\nmany times have we, poor creatures, been severely pinched with hunger,\r\nwhen meat and bread have been moulding under the lock, while the key\r\nwas in the pocket of our mistress. This had been so when she _knew_ we\r\nwere nearly half starved; and yet, that mistress, with saintly air,\r\nwould kneel with her husband, and pray each morning that a merciful God\r\nwould bless them in basket and in store, and save them, at last, in his\r\nkingdom. But I proceed with the argument.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary that right to steal from _others_ should be\r\nestablished; and this could only rest upon a wider range of\r\ngeneralization than that which supposed the right to steal from my\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nIt was sometime before I arrived at this clear right. The reader will\r\nget some idea of my train of reasoning, by a brief statement of the\r\ncase. “I am,” thought I, “not only the slave of Thomas, but I am the\r\nslave of society at large. Society at large has bound itself, in form\r\nand in fact, to assist Master Thomas in robbing me of my rightful\r\nliberty, and of the just reward of my labor; therefore, whatever rights\r\nI have against Master Thomas, I have, equally, against those\r\nconfederated with him in robbing me of liberty. As society has marked\r\nme out as privileged plunder, on the principle of self-preservation I\r\nam justified in plundering in turn. Since each slave belongs to all;\r\nall must, therefore, belong to each.”\r\n\r\nI shall here make a profession of faith which may shock some, offend\r\nothers, and be dissented from by all. It is this: Within the bounds of\r\nhis just earnings, I hold that the slave is fully justified in helping\r\nhimself to the _gold and silver, and the best apparel of his master, or\r\nthat of any other slaveholder; and that such taking is not stealing in\r\nany just sense of that word_.\r\n\r\nThe morality of _free_ society can have no application to _slave_\r\nsociety. Slaveholders have made it almost impossible for the slave to\r\ncommit any crime, known either to the laws of God or to the laws of\r\nman. If he steals, he takes his own; if he kills his master, he\r\nimitates only the heroes of the revolution. Slaveholders I hold to be\r\nindividually and collectively responsible for all the evils which grow\r\nout of the horrid relation, and I believe they will be so held at the\r\njudgment, in the sight of a just God. Make a man a slave, and you rob\r\nhim of moral responsibility. Freedom of choice is the essence of all\r\naccountability. But my kind readers are, probably, less concerned about\r\nmy opinions, than about that which more nearly touches my personal\r\nexperience; albeit, my opinions have, in some sort, been formed by that\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nBad as slaveholders are, I have seldom met with one so entirely\r\ndestitute of every element of character capable of inspiring respect,\r\nas was my present master, Capt. Thomas Auld.\r\n\r\nWhen I lived with him, I thought him incapable of a noble action. The\r\nleading trait in his character was intense selfishness. I think he was\r\nfully aware of this fact himself, and often tried to conceal it. Capt.\r\nAuld was not a _born_ slaveholder—not a birthright member of the\r\nslaveholding oligarchy. He was only a slaveholder by _marriage-right;_\r\nand, of all slaveholders, these latter are, _by far_, the most\r\nexacting. There was in him all the love of domination, the pride of\r\nmastery, and the swagger of authority, but his rule lacked the vital\r\nelement of consistency. He could be cruel; but his methods of showing\r\nit were cowardly, and evinced his meanness rather than his spirit. His\r\ncommands were strong, his enforcement weak.\r\n\r\nSlaves are not insensible to the whole-souled characteristics of a\r\ngenerous, dashing slaveholder, who is fearless of consequences; and\r\nthey prefer a master of this bold and daring kind—even with the risk of\r\nbeing shot down for impudence to the fretful, little soul, who never\r\nuses the lash but at the suggestion of a love of gain.\r\n\r\nSlaves, too, readily distinguish between the birthright bearing of the\r\noriginal slaveholder and the assumed attitudes of the accidental\r\nslaveholder; and while they cannot respect either, they certainly\r\ndespise the latter more than the former.\r\n\r\nThe luxury of having slaves wait upon him was something new to Master\r\nThomas; and for it he was wholly unprepared. He was a slaveholder,\r\nwithout the ability to hold or manage his slaves. We seldom called him\r\n“master,” but generally addressed him by his “bay craft” title—“_Capt.\r\nAuld_.” It is easy to see that such conduct might do much to make him\r\nappear awkward, and, consequently, fretful. His wife was especially\r\nsolicitous to have us call her husband “master.” Is your _master_ at\r\nthe store?”—“Where is your _master_?”—“Go and tell your _master”_—“I\r\nwill make your _master_ acquainted with your conduct”—she would say;\r\nbut we were inapt scholars. Especially were I and my sister Eliza inapt\r\nin this particular. Aunt Priscilla was less stubborn and defiant in her\r\nspirit than Eliza and myself; and, I think, her road was less rough\r\nthan ours.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1833, when I had almost become desperate under\r\nthe treatment of Master Thomas, and when I entertained more strongly\r\nthan ever the oft-repeated determination to run away, a circumstance\r\noccurred which seemed to promise brighter and better days for us all.\r\nAt a Methodist camp-meeting, held in the Bay Side (a famous place for\r\ncampmeetings) about eight miles from St. Michael’s, Master Thomas came\r\nout with a profession of religion. He had long been an object of\r\ninterest to the church, and to the ministers, as I had seen by the\r\nrepeated visits and lengthy exhortations of the latter. He was a fish\r\nquite worth catching, for he had money and standing. In the community\r\nof St. Michael’s he was equal to the best citizen. He was strictly\r\ntemperate; _perhaps_, from principle, but most likely, from interest.\r\nThere was very little to do for him, to give him the appearance of\r\npiety, and to make him a pillar in the church. Well, the camp-meeting\r\ncontinued a week; people gathered from all parts of the county, and two\r\nsteamboat loads came from Baltimore. The ground was happily chosen;\r\nseats were arranged; a stand erected; a rude altar fenced in, fronting\r\nthe preachers’ stand, with straw in it for the accommodation of\r\nmourners. This latter would hold at least one hundred persons. In\r\nfront, and on the sides of the preachers’ stand, and outside the long\r\nrows of seats, rose the first class of stately tents, each vieing with\r\nthe other in strength, neatness, and capacity for accommodating its\r\ninmates. Behind this first circle of tents was another, less imposing,\r\nwhich reached round the camp-ground to the speakers’ stand. Outside\r\nthis second class of tents were covered wagons, ox carts, and vehicles\r\nof every shape and size. These served as tents to their owners. Outside\r\nof these, huge fires were burning, in all directions, where roasting,\r\nand boiling, and frying, were going on, for the benefit of those who\r\nwere attending to their own spiritual welfare within the circle.\r\n_Behind_ the preachers’ stand, a narrow space was marked out for the\r\nuse of the colored people. There were no seats provided for this class\r\nof persons; the preachers addressed them, _“over the left,”_ if they\r\naddressed them at all. After the preaching was over, at every service,\r\nan invitation was given to mourners to come into the pen; and, in some\r\ncases, ministers went out to persuade men and women to come in. By one\r\nof these ministers, Master Thomas Auld was persuaded to go inside the\r\npen. I was deeply interested in that matter, and followed; and, though\r\ncolored people were not allowed either in the pen or in front of the\r\npreachers’ stand, I ventured to take my stand at a sort of half-way\r\nplace between the blacks and whites, where I could distinctly see the\r\nmovements of mourners, and especially the progress of Master Thomas.\r\n\r\n“If he has got religion,” thought I, “he will emancipate his slaves;\r\nand if he should not do so much as this, he will, at any rate, behave\r\ntoward us more kindly, and feed us more generously than he has\r\nheretofore done.” Appealing to my own religious experience, and judging\r\nmy master by what was true in my own case, I could not regard him as\r\nsoundly converted, unless some such good results followed his\r\nprofession of religion.\r\n\r\nBut in my expectations I was doubly disappointed; Master Thomas was\r\n_Master Thomas_ still. The fruits of his righteousness were to show\r\nthemselves in no such way as I had anticipated. His conversion was not\r\nto change his relation toward men—at any rate not toward BLACK men—but\r\ntoward God. My faith, I confess, was not great. There was something in\r\nhis appearance that, in my mind, cast a doubt over his conversion.\r\nStanding where I did, I could see his every movement. I watched\r\nnarrowly while he remained in the little pen; and although I saw that\r\nhis face was extremely red, and his hair disheveled, and though I heard\r\nhim groan, and saw a stray tear halting on his cheek, as if inquiring\r\n“which way shall I go?”—I could not wholly confide in the genuineness\r\nof his conversion. The hesitating behavior of that tear-drop and its\r\nloneliness, distressed me, and cast a doubt upon the whole transaction,\r\nof which it was a part. But people said, _“Capt. Auld had come\r\nthrough,”_ and it was for me to hope for the best. I was bound to do\r\nthis, in charity, for I, too, was religious, and had been in the church\r\nfull three years, although now I was not more than sixteen years old.\r\nSlaveholders may, sometimes, have confidence in the piety of some of\r\ntheir slaves; but the slaves seldom have confidence in the piety of\r\ntheir masters. _“He cant go to heaven with our blood in his skirts_,”\r\nis a settled point in the creed of every slave; rising superior to all\r\nteaching to the contrary, and standing forever as a fixed fact. The\r\nhighest evidence the slaveholder can give the slave of his acceptance\r\nwith God, is the emancipation of his slaves. This is proof that he is\r\nwilling to give up all to God, and for the sake of God. Not to do this,\r\nwas, in my estimation, and in the opinion of all the slaves, an\r\nevidence of half-heartedness, and wholly inconsistent with the idea of\r\ngenuine conversion. I had read, also, somewhere in the Methodist\r\nDiscipline, the following question and answer:\r\n\r\n“_Question_. What shall be done for the extirpation of slavery?\r\n\r\n“_Answer_. We declare that we are much as ever convinced of the great\r\nevil of slavery; therefore, no slaveholder shall be eligible to any\r\nofficial station in our church.”\r\n\r\nThese words sounded in my ears for a long time, and encouraged me to\r\nhope. But, as I have before said, I was doomed to disappointment.\r\nMaster Thomas seemed to be aware of my hopes and expectations\r\nconcerning him. I have thought, before now, that he looked at me in\r\nanswer to my glances, as much as to say, “I will teach you, young man,\r\nthat, though I have parted with my sins, I have not parted with my\r\nsense. I shall hold my slaves, and go to heaven too.”\r\n\r\nPossibly, to convince us that we must not presume _too much_ upon his\r\nrecent conversion, he became rather more rigid and stringent in his\r\nexactions. There always was a scarcity of good nature about the man;\r\nbut now his whole countenance was _soured_ over with the seemings of\r\npiety. His religion, therefore, neither made him emancipate his slaves,\r\nnor caused him to treat them with greater humanity. If religion had any\r\neffect on his character at all, it made him more cruel and hateful in\r\nall his ways. The natural wickedness of his heart had not been removed,\r\nbut only reinforced, by the profession of religion. Do I judge him\r\nharshly? God forbid. Facts _are_ facts. Capt. Auld made the greatest\r\nprofession of piety. His house was, literally, a house of prayer. In\r\nthe morning, and in the evening, loud prayers and hymns were heard\r\nthere, in which both himself and his wife joined; yet, _no more meal_\r\nwas brought from the mill, _no more attention_ was paid to the moral\r\nwelfare of the kitchen; and nothing was done to make us feel that the\r\nheart of Master Thomas was one whit better than it was before he went\r\ninto the little pen, opposite to the preachers’ stand, on the camp\r\nground.\r\n\r\nOur hopes (founded on the discipline) soon vanished; for the\r\nauthorities let him into the church _at once_, and before he was out of\r\nhis term of _probation_, I heard of his leading class! He distinguished\r\nhimself greatly among the brethren, and was soon an exhorter. His\r\nprogress was almost as rapid as the growth of the fabled vine of Jack’s\r\nbean. No man was more active than he, in revivals. He would go many\r\nmiles to assist in carrying them on, and in getting outsiders\r\ninterested in religion. His house being one of the holiest, if not the\r\nhappiest in St. Michael’s, became the “preachers’ home.” These\r\npreachers evidently liked to share Master Thomas’s hospitality; for\r\nwhile he _starved us_, he _stuffed_ them. Three or four of these\r\nambassadors of the gospel—according to slavery—have been there at a\r\ntime; all living on the fat of the land, while we, in the kitchen, were\r\nnearly starving. Not often did we get a smile of recognition from these\r\nholy men. They seemed almost as unconcerned about our getting to\r\nheaven, as they were about our getting out of slavery. To this general\r\ncharge there was one exception—the Rev. GEORGE COOKMAN. Unlike Rev.\r\nMessrs. Storks, Ewry, Hickey, Humphrey and Cooper (all whom were on the\r\nSt. Michael’s circuit) he kindly took an interest in our temporal and\r\nspiritual welfare. Our souls and our bodies were all alike sacred in\r\nhis sight; and he really had a good deal of genuine anti-slavery\r\nfeeling mingled with his colonization ideas. There was not a slave in\r\nour neighborhood that did not love, and almost venerate, Mr. Cookman.\r\nIt was pretty generally believed that he had been chiefly instrumental\r\nin bringing one of the largest slaveholders—Mr. Samuel Harrison—in that\r\nneighborhood, to emancipate all his slaves, and, indeed, the general\r\nimpression was, that Mr. Cookman had labored faithfully with\r\nslaveholders, whenever he met them, to induce them to emancipate their\r\nbondmen, and that he did this as a religious duty. When this good man\r\nwas at our house, we were all sure to be called in to prayers in the\r\nmorning; and he was not slow in making inquiries as to the state of our\r\nminds, nor in giving us a word of exhortation and of encouragement.\r\nGreat was the sorrow of all the slaves, when this faithful preacher of\r\nthe gospel was removed from the Talbot county circuit. He was an\r\neloquent preacher, and possessed what few ministers, south of Mason\r\nDixon’s line, possess, or _dare_ to show, viz: a warm and philanthropic\r\nheart. The Mr. Cookman, of whom I speak, was an Englishman by birth,\r\nand perished while on his way to England, on board the ill-fated\r\n“President”. Could the thousands of slaves in Maryland know the fate of\r\nthe good man, to whose words of comfort they were so largely indebted,\r\nthey would thank me for dropping a tear on this page, in memory of\r\ntheir favorite preacher, friend and benefactor.\r\n\r\nBut, let me return to Master Thomas, and to my experience, after his\r\nconversion. In Baltimore, I could, occasionally, get into a Sabbath\r\nschool, among the free children, and receive lessons, with the rest;\r\nbut, having already learned both to read and to write, I was more of a\r\nteacher than a pupil, even there. When, however, I went back to the\r\nEastern Shore, and was at the house of Master Thomas, I was neither\r\nallowed to teach, nor to be taught. The whole community—with but a\r\nsingle exception, among the whites—frowned upon everything like\r\nimparting instruction either to slaves or to free colored persons. That\r\nsingle exception, a pious young man, named Wilson, asked me, one day,\r\nif I would like to assist him in teaching a little Sabbath school, at\r\nthe house of a free colored man in St. Michael’s, named James Mitchell.\r\nThe idea was to me a delightful one, and I told him I would gladly\r\ndevote as much of my Sabbath as I could command, to that most laudable\r\nwork. Mr. Wilson soon mustered up a dozen old spelling books, and a few\r\ntestaments; and we commenced operations, with some twenty scholars, in\r\nour Sunday school. Here, thought I, is something worth living for; here\r\nis an excellent chance for usefulness; and I shall soon have a company\r\nof young friends, lovers of knowledge, like some of my Baltimore\r\nfriends, from whom I now felt parted forever.\r\n\r\nOur first Sabbath passed delightfully, and I spent the week after very\r\njoyously. I could not go to Baltimore, but I could make a little\r\nBaltimore here. At our second meeting, I learned that there was some\r\nobjection to the existence of the Sabbath school; and, sure enough, we\r\nhad scarcely got at work—_good work_, simply teaching a few colored\r\nchildren how to read the gospel of the Son of God—when in rushed a mob,\r\nheaded by Mr. Wright Fairbanks and Mr. Garrison West—two\r\nclass-leaders—and Master Thomas; who, armed with sticks and other\r\nmissiles, drove us off, and commanded us never to meet for such a\r\npurpose again. One of this pious crew told me, that as for my part, I\r\nwanted to be another Nat Turner; and if I did not look out, I should\r\nget as many balls into me, as Nat did into him. Thus ended the infant\r\nSabbath school, in the town of St. Michael’s. The reader will not be\r\nsurprised when I say, that the breaking up of my Sabbath school, by\r\nthese class-leaders, and professedly holy men, did not serve to\r\nstrengthen my religious convictions. The cloud over my St. Michael’s\r\nhome grew heavier and blacker than ever.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely the agency of Master Thomas, in breaking up and\r\ndestroying my Sabbath school, that shook my confidence in the power of\r\nsouthern religion to make men wiser or better; but I saw in him all the\r\ncruelty and meanness, _after_ his conversion, which he had exhibited\r\nbefore he made a profession of religion. His cruelty and meanness were\r\nespecially displayed in his treatment of my unfortunate cousin, Henny,\r\nwhose lameness made her a burden to him. I have no extraordinary\r\npersonal hard usage toward myself to complain of, against him, but I\r\nhave seen him tie up the lame and maimed woman, and whip her in a\r\nmanner most brutal, and shocking; and then, with blood-chilling\r\nblasphemy, he would quote the passage of scripture, “That servant which\r\nknew his lord’s will, and prepared not himself, neither did according\r\nto his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.” Master would keep this\r\nlacerated woman tied up by her wrists, to a bolt in the joist, three,\r\nfour and five hours at a time. He would tie her up early in the\r\nmorning, whip her with a cowskin before breakfast; leave her tied up;\r\ngo to his store, and, returning to his dinner, repeat the castigation;\r\nlaying on the rugged lash, on flesh already made raw by repeated blows.\r\nHe seemed desirous to get the poor girl out of existence, or, at any\r\nrate, off his hands. In proof of this, he afterwards gave her away to\r\nhis sister Sarah (Mrs. Cline) but, as in the case of Master Hugh, Henny\r\nwas soon returned on his hands. Finally, upon a pretense that he could\r\ndo nothing with her (I use his own words) he “set her adrift, to take\r\ncare of herself.” Here was a recently converted man, holding, with\r\ntight grasp, the well-framed, and able bodied slaves left him by old\r\nmaster—the persons, who, in freedom, could have taken care of\r\nthemselves; yet, turning loose the only cripple among them, virtually\r\nto starve and die.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, had Master Thomas been asked, by some pious northern brother,\r\n_why_ he continued to sustain the relation of a slaveholder, to those\r\nwhom he retained, his answer would have been precisely the same as many\r\nother religious slaveholders have returned to that inquiry, viz: “I\r\nhold my slaves for their own good.”\r\n\r\nBad as my condition was when I lived with Master Thomas, I was soon to\r\nexperience a life far more goading and bitter. The many differences\r\nspringing up between myself and Master Thomas, owing to the clear\r\nperception I had of his character, and the boldness with which I\r\ndefended myself against his capricious complaints, led him to declare\r\nthat I was unsuited to his wants; that my city life had affected me\r\nperniciously; that, in fact, it had almost ruined me for every good\r\npurpose, and had fitted me for everything that was bad. One of my\r\ngreatest faults, or offenses, was that of letting his horse get away,\r\nand go down to the farm belonging to his father-in-law. The animal had\r\na liking for that farm, with which I fully sympathized. Whenever I let\r\nit out, it would go dashing down the road to Mr. Hamilton’s, as if\r\ngoing on a grand frolic. My horse gone, of course I must go after it.\r\nThe explanation of our mutual attachment to the place is the same; the\r\nhorse found there good pasturage, and I found there plenty of bread.\r\nMr. Hamilton had his faults, but starving his slaves was not among\r\nthem. He gave food, in abundance, and that, too, of an excellent\r\nquality. In Mr. Hamilton’s cook—Aunt Mary—I found a most generous and\r\nconsiderate friend. She never allowed me to go there without giving me\r\nbread enough to make good the deficiencies of a day or two. Master\r\nThomas at last resolved to endure my behavior no longer; he could\r\nneither keep me, nor his horse, we liked so well to be at his\r\nfather-in-law’s farm. I had now lived with him nearly nine months, and\r\nhe had given me a number of severe whippings, without any visible\r\nimprovement in my character, or my conduct; and now he was resolved to\r\nput me out—as he said—“_to be broken._”\r\n\r\nThere was, in the Bay Side, very near the camp ground, where my master\r\ngot his religious impressions, a man named Edward Covey, who enjoyed\r\nthe execrated reputation, of being a first rate hand at breaking young\r\nNegroes. This Covey was a poor man, a farm renter; and this reputation\r\n(hateful as it was to the slaves and to all good men) was, at the same\r\ntime, of immense advantage to him. It enabled him to get his farm\r\ntilled with very little expense, compared with what it would have cost\r\nhim without this most extraordinary reputation. Some slaveholders\r\nthought it an advantage to let Mr. Covey have the government of their\r\nslaves a year or two, almost free of charge, for the sake of the\r\nexcellent training such slaves got under his happy management! Like\r\nsome horse breakers, noted for their skill, who ride the best horses in\r\nthe country without expense, Mr. Covey could have under him, the most\r\nfiery bloods of the neighborhood, for the simple reward of returning\r\nthem to their owners, _well broken_. Added to the natural fitness of\r\nMr. Covey for the duties of his profession, he was said to “enjoy\r\nreligion,” and was as strict in the cultivation of piety, as he was in\r\nthe cultivation of his farm. I was made aware of his character by some\r\nwho had been under his hand; and while I could not look forward to\r\ngoing to him with any pleasure, I was glad to get away from St.\r\nMichael’s. I was sure of getting enough to eat at Covey’s, even if I\r\nsuffered in other respects. _This_, to a hungry man, is not a prospect\r\nto be regarded with indifference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. _Covey, the Negro Breaker_\r\n\r\n\r\nJOURNEY TO MY NEW MASTER’S—MEDITATIONS BY THE WAY—VIEW OF COVEY’S\r\nRESIDENCE—THE FAMILY—MY AWKWARDNESS AS A FIELD HAND—A CRUEL BEATING—WHY\r\nIT WAS GIVEN—DESCRIPTION OF COVEY—FIRST ADVENTURE AT OX DRIVING—HAIR\r\nBREADTH ESCAPES—OX AND MAN ALIKE PROPERTY—COVEY’S MANNER OF PROCEEDING\r\nTO WHIP—HARD LABOR BETTER THAN THE WHIP FOR BREAKING DOWN THE\r\nSPIRIT—CUNNING AND TRICKERY OF COVEY—FAMILY WORSHIP—SHOCKING CONTEMPT\r\nFOR CHASTITY—I AM BROKEN DOWN—GREAT MENTAL AGITATION IN CONTRASTING THE\r\nFREEDOM OF THE SHIPS WITH HIS OWN SLAVERY—ANGUISH BEYOND DESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning of the first of January, 1834, with its chilling wind and\r\npinching frost, quite in harmony with the winter in my own mind, found\r\nme, with my little bundle of clothing on the end of a stick, swung\r\nacross my shoulder, on the main road, bending my way toward Covey’s,\r\nwhither I had been imperiously ordered by Master Thomas. The latter had\r\nbeen as good as his word, and had committed me, without reserve, to the\r\nmastery of Mr. Edward Covey. Eight or ten years had now passed since I\r\nhad been taken from my grandmother’s cabin, in Tuckahoe; and these\r\nyears, for the most part, I had spent in Baltimore, where—as the reader\r\nhas already seen—I was treated with comparative tenderness. I was now\r\nabout to sound profounder depths in slave life. The rigors of a field,\r\nless tolerable than the field of battle, awaited me. My new master was\r\nnotorious for his fierce and savage disposition, and my only\r\nconsolation in going to live with him was, the certainty of finding him\r\nprecisely as represented by common fame. There was neither joy in my\r\nheart, nor elasticity in my step, as I started in search of the\r\ntyrant’s home. Starvation made me glad to leave Thomas Auld’s, and the\r\ncruel lash made me dread to go to Covey’s. Escape was impossible; so,\r\nheavy and sad, I paced the seven miles, which separated Covey’s house\r\nfrom St. Michael’s—thinking much by the solitary way—averse to my\r\ncondition; but _thinking_ was all I could do. Like a fish in a net,\r\nallowed to play for a time, I was now drawn rapidly to the shore,\r\nsecured at all points. “I am,” thought I, “but the sport of a power\r\nwhich makes no account, either of my welfare or of my happiness. By a\r\nlaw which I can clearly comprehend, but cannot evade nor resist, I am\r\nruthlessly snatched from the hearth of a fond grandmother, and hurried\r\naway to the home of a mysterious ‘old master;’ again I am removed from\r\nthere, to a master in Baltimore; thence am I snatched away to the\r\nEastern Shore, to be valued with the beasts of the field, and, with\r\nthem, divided and set apart for a possessor; then I am sent back to\r\nBaltimore; and by the time I have formed new attachments, and have\r\nbegun to hope that no more rude shocks shall touch me, a difference\r\narises between brothers, and I am again broken up, and sent to St.\r\nMichael’s; and now, from the latter place, I am footing my way to the\r\nhome of a new master, where, I am given to understand, that, like a\r\nwild young working animal, I am to be broken to the yoke of a bitter\r\nand life-long bondage.”\r\n\r\nWith thoughts and reflections like these, I came in sight of a small\r\nwood-colored building, about a mile from the main road, which, from the\r\ndescription I had received, at starting, I easily recognized as my new\r\nhome. The Chesapeake bay—upon the jutting banks of which the little\r\nwood-colored house was standing—white with foam, raised by the heavy\r\nnorth-west wind; Poplar Island, covered with a thick, black pine\r\nforest, standing out amid this half ocean; and Kent Point, stretching\r\nits sandy, desert-like shores out into the foam-cested bay—were all in\r\nsight, and deepened the wild and desolate aspect of my new home.\r\n\r\nThe good clothes I had brought with me from Baltimore were now worn\r\nthin, and had not been replaced; for Master Thomas was as little\r\ncareful to provide us against cold, as against hunger. Met here by a\r\nnorth wind, sweeping through an open space of forty miles, I was glad\r\nto make any port; and, therefore, I speedily pressed on to the little\r\nwood-colored house. The family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Covey; Miss\r\nKemp (a broken-backed woman) a sister of Mrs. Covey; William Hughes,\r\ncousin to Edward Covey; Caroline, the cook; Bill Smith, a hired man;\r\nand myself. Bill Smith, Bill Hughes, and myself, were the working force\r\nof the farm, which consisted of three or four hundred acres. I was now,\r\nfor the first time in my life, to be a field hand; and in my new\r\nemployment I found myself even more awkward than a green country boy\r\nmay be supposed to be, upon his first entrance into the bewildering\r\nscenes of city life; and my awkwardness gave me much trouble. Strange\r\nand unnatural as it may seem, I had been at my new home but three days,\r\nbefore Mr. Covey (my brother in the Methodist church) gave me a bitter\r\nforetaste of what was in reserve for me. I presume he thought, that\r\nsince he had but a single year in which to complete his work, the\r\nsooner he began, the better. Perhaps he thought that by coming to blows\r\nat once, we should mutually better understand our relations. But to\r\nwhatever motive, direct or indirect, the cause may be referred, I had\r\nnot been in his possession three whole days, before he subjected me to\r\na most brutal chastisement. Under his heavy blows, blood flowed freely,\r\nand wales were left on my back as large as my little finger. The sores\r\non my back, from this flogging, continued for weeks, for they were kept\r\nopen by the rough and coarse cloth which I wore for shirting. The\r\noccasion and details of this first chapter of my experience as a field\r\nhand, must be told, that the reader may see how unreasonable, as well\r\nas how cruel, my new master, Covey, was. The whole thing I found to be\r\ncharacteristic of the man; and I was probably treated no worse by him\r\nthan scores of lads who had previously been committed to him, for\r\nreasons similar to those which induced my master to place me with him.\r\nBut, here are the facts connected with the affair, precisely as they\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nOn one of the coldest days of the whole month of January, 1834, I was\r\nordered, at day break, to get a load of wood, from a forest about two\r\nmiles from the house. In order to perform this work, Mr. Covey gave me\r\na pair of unbroken oxen, for, it seems, his breaking abilities had not\r\nbeen turned in this direction; and I may remark, in passing, that\r\nworking animals in the south, are seldom so well trained as in the\r\nnorth. In due form, and with all proper ceremony, I was introduced to\r\nthis huge yoke of unbroken oxen, and was carefully told which was\r\n“Buck,” and which was “Darby”—which was the “in hand,” and which was\r\nthe “off hand” ox. The master of this important ceremony was no less a\r\nperson than Mr. Covey, himself; and the introduction was the first of\r\nthe kind I had ever had. My life, hitherto, had led me away from horned\r\ncattle, and I had no knowledge of the art of managing them. What was\r\nmeant by the “in ox,” as against the “off ox,” when both were equally\r\nfastened to one cart, and under one yoke, I could not very easily\r\ndivine; and the difference, implied by the names, and the peculiar\r\nduties of each, were alike _Greek_ to me. Why was not the “off ox”\r\ncalled the “in ox?” Where and what is the reason for this distinction\r\nin names, when there is none in the things themselves? After initiating\r\nme into the _“woa,” “back” “gee,” “hither”_—the entire spoken language\r\nbetween oxen and driver—Mr. Covey took a rope, about ten feet long and\r\none inch thick, and placed one end of it around the horns of the “in\r\nhand ox,” and gave the other end to me, telling me that if the oxen\r\nstarted to run away, as the scamp knew they would, I must hold on to\r\nthe rope and stop them. I need not tell any one who is acquainted with\r\neither the strength of the disposition of an untamed ox, that this\r\norder was about as unreasonable as a command to shoulder a mad bull! I\r\nhad never driven oxen before, and I was as awkward, as a driver, as it\r\nis possible to conceive. It did not answer for me to plead ignorance,\r\nto Mr. Covey; there was something in his manner that quite forbade\r\nthat. He was a man to whom a slave seldom felt any disposition to\r\nspeak. Cold, distant, morose, with a face wearing all the marks of\r\ncaptious pride and malicious sternness, he repelled all advances. Covey\r\nwas not a large man; he was only about five feet ten inches in height,\r\nI should think; short necked, round shoulders; of quick and wiry\r\nmotion, of thin and wolfish visage; with a pair of small, greenish-gray\r\neyes, set well back under a forehead without dignity, and constantly in\r\nmotion, and floating his passions, rather than his thoughts, in sight,\r\nbut denying them utterance in words. The creature presented an\r\nappearance altogether ferocious and sinister, disagreeable and\r\nforbidding, in the extreme. When he spoke, it was from the corner of\r\nhis mouth, and in a sort of light growl, like a dog, when an attempt is\r\nmade to take a bone from him. The fellow had already made me believe\r\nhim even _worse_ than he had been presented. With his directions, and\r\nwithout stopping to question, I started for the woods, quite anxious to\r\nperform my first exploit in driving, in a creditable manner. The\r\ndistance from the house to the woods gate a full mile, I should\r\nthink—was passed over with very little difficulty; for although the\r\nanimals ran, I was fleet enough, in the open field, to keep pace with\r\nthem; especially as they pulled me along at the end of the rope; but,\r\non reaching the woods, I was speedily thrown into a distressing plight.\r\nThe animals took fright, and started off ferociously into the woods,\r\ncarrying the cart, full tilt, against trees, over stumps, and dashing\r\nfrom side to side, in a manner altogether frightful. As I held the\r\nrope, I expected every moment to be crushed between the cart and the\r\nhuge trees, among which they were so furiously dashing. After running\r\nthus for several minutes, my oxen were, finally, brought to a stand, by\r\na tree, against which they dashed themselves with great violence,\r\nupsetting the cart, and entangling themselves among sundry young\r\nsaplings. By the shock, the body of the cart was flung in one\r\ndirection, and the wheels and tongue in another, and all in the\r\ngreatest confusion. There I was, all alone, in a thick wood, to which I\r\nwas a stranger; my cart upset and shattered; my oxen entangled, wild,\r\nand enraged; and I, poor soul! but a green hand, to set all this\r\ndisorder right. I knew no more of oxen than the ox driver is supposed\r\nto know of wisdom. After standing a few moments surveying the damage\r\nand disorder, and not without a presentiment that this trouble would\r\ndraw after it others, even more distressing, I took one end of the cart\r\nbody, and, by an extra outlay of strength, I lifted it toward the\r\naxle-tree, from which it had been violently flung; and after much\r\npulling and straining, I succeeded in getting the body of the cart in\r\nits place. This was an important step out of the difficulty, and its\r\nperformance increased my courage for the work which remained to be\r\ndone. The cart was provided with an ax, a tool with which I had become\r\npretty well acquainted in the ship yard at Baltimore. With this, I cut\r\ndown the saplings by which my oxen were entangled, and again pursued my\r\njourney, with my heart in my mouth, lest the oxen should again take it\r\ninto their senseless heads to cut up a caper. My fears were groundless.\r\nTheir spree was over for the present, and the rascals now moved off as\r\nsoberly as though their behavior had been natural and exemplary. On\r\nreaching the part of the forest where I had been, the day before,\r\nchopping wood, I filled the cart with a heavy load, as a security\r\nagainst another running away. But, the neck of an ox is equal in\r\nstrength to iron. It defies all ordinary burdens, when excited. Tame\r\nand docile to a proverb, when _well_ trained, the ox is the most sullen\r\nand intractable of animals when but half broken to the yoke.\r\n\r\nI now saw, in my situation, several points of similarity with that of\r\nthe oxen. They were property, so was I; they were to be broken, so was\r\nI. Covey was to break me, I was to break them; break and be broken—such\r\nis life.\r\n\r\nHalf the day already gone, and my face not yet homeward! It required\r\nonly two day’s experience and observation to teach me, that such\r\napparent waste of time would not be lightly overlooked by Covey. I\r\ntherefore hurried toward home; but, on reaching the lane gate, I met\r\nwith the crowning disaster for the day. This gate was a fair specimen\r\nof southern handicraft. There were two huge posts, eighteen inches in\r\ndiameter, rough hewed and square, and the heavy gate was so hung on one\r\nof these, that it opened only about half the proper distance. On\r\narriving here, it was necessary for me to let go the end of the rope on\r\nthe horns of the “in hand ox;” and now as soon as the gate was open,\r\nand I let go of it to get the rope, again, off went my oxen—making\r\nnothing of their load—full tilt; and in doing so they caught the huge\r\ngate between the wheel and the cart body, literally crushing it to\r\nsplinters, and coming only within a few inches of subjecting me to a\r\nsimilar crushing, for I was just in advance of the wheel when it struck\r\nthe left gate post. With these two hair-breadth escape, I thought I\r\ncould sucessfully(sic) explain to Mr. Covey the delay, and avert\r\napprehended punishment. I was not without a faint hope of being\r\ncommended for the stern resolution which I had displayed in\r\naccomplishing the difficult task—a task which, I afterwards learned,\r\neven Covey himself would not have undertaken, without first driving the\r\noxen for some time in the open field, preparatory to their going into\r\nthe woods. But, in this I was disappointed. On coming to him, his\r\ncountenance assumed an aspect of rigid displeasure, and, as I gave him\r\na history of the casualties of my trip, his wolfish face, with his\r\ngreenish eyes, became intensely ferocious. “Go back to the woods\r\nagain,” he said, muttering something else about wasting time. I hastily\r\nobeyed; but I had not gone far on my way, when I saw him coming after\r\nme. My oxen now behaved themselves with singular propriety, opposing\r\ntheir present conduct to my representation of their former antics. I\r\nalmost wished, now that Covey was coming, they would do something in\r\nkeeping with the character I had given them; but no, they had already\r\nhad their spree, and they could afford now to be extra good, readily\r\nobeying my orders, and seeming to understand them quite as well as I\r\ndid myself. On reaching the woods, my tormentor—who seemed all the way\r\nto be remarking upon the good behavior of his oxen—came up to me, and\r\nordered me to stop the cart, accompanying the same with the threat that\r\nhe would now teach me how to break gates, and idle away my time, when\r\nhe sent me to the woods. Suiting the action to the word, Covey paced\r\noff, in his own wiry fashion, to a large, black gum tree, the young\r\nshoots of which are generally used for ox _goads_, they being\r\nexceedingly tough. Three of these _goads_, from four to six feet long,\r\nhe cut off, and trimmed up, with his large jack-knife. This done, he\r\nordered me to take off my clothes. To this unreasonable order I made no\r\nreply, but sternly refused to take off my clothing. “If you will beat\r\nme,” thought I, “you shall do so over my clothes.” After many threats,\r\nwhich made no impression on me, he rushed at me with something of the\r\nsavage fierceness of a wolf, tore off the few and thinly worn clothes I\r\nhad on, and proceeded to wear out, on my back, the heavy goads which he\r\nhad cut from the gum tree. This flogging was the first of a series of\r\nfloggings; and though very severe, it was less so than many which came\r\nafter it, and these, for offenses far lighter than the gate breaking.\r\n\r\nI remained with Mr. Covey one year (I cannot say I _lived_ with him)\r\nand during the first six months that I was there, I was whipped, either\r\nwith sticks or cowskins, every week. Aching bones and a sore back were\r\nmy constant companions. Frequent as the lash was used, Mr. Covey\r\nthought less of it, as a means of breaking down my spirit, than that of\r\nhard and long continued labor. He worked me steadily, up to the point\r\nof my powers of endurance. From the dawn of day in the morning, till\r\nthe darkness was complete in the evening, I was kept at hard work, in\r\nthe field or the woods. At certain seasons of the year, we were all\r\nkept in the field till eleven and twelve o’clock at night. At these\r\ntimes, Covey would attend us in the field, and urge us on with words or\r\nblows, as it seemed best to him. He had, in his life, been an overseer,\r\nand he well understood the business of slave driving. There was no\r\ndeceiving him. He knew just what a man or boy could do, and he held\r\nboth to strict account. When he pleased, he would work himself, like a\r\nvery Turk, making everything fly before him. It was, however, scarcely\r\nnecessary for Mr. Covey to be really present in the field, to have his\r\nwork go on industriously. He had the faculty of making us feel that he\r\nwas always present. By a series of adroitly managed surprises, which he\r\npracticed, I was prepared to expect him at any moment. His plan was,\r\nnever to approach the spot where his hands were at work, in an open,\r\nmanly and direct manner. No thief was ever more artful in his devices\r\nthan this man Covey. He would creep and crawl, in ditches and gullies;\r\nhide behind stumps and bushes, and practice so much of the cunning of\r\nthe serpent, that Bill Smith and I—between ourselves—never called him\r\nby any other name than _“the snake.”_ We fancied that in his eyes and\r\nhis gait we could see a snakish resemblance. One half of his\r\nproficiency in the art of Negro breaking, consisted, I should think, in\r\nthis species of cunning. We were never secure. He could see or hear us\r\nnearly all the time. He was, to us, behind every stump, tree, bush and\r\nfence on the plantation. He carried this kind of trickery so far, that\r\nhe would sometimes mount his horse, and make believe he was going to\r\nSt. Michael’s; and, in thirty minutes afterward, you might find his\r\nhorse tied in the woods, and the snake-like Covey lying flat in the\r\nditch, with his head lifted above its edge, or in a fence corner,\r\nwatching every movement of the slaves! I have known him walk up to us\r\nand give us special orders, as to our work, in advance, as if he were\r\nleaving home with a view to being absent several days; and before he\r\ngot half way to the house, he would avail himself of our inattention to\r\nhis movements, to turn short on his heels, conceal himself behind a\r\nfence corner or a tree, and watch us until the going down of the sun.\r\nMean and contemptible as is all this, it is in keeping with the\r\ncharacter which the life of a slaveholder is calculated to produce.\r\nThere is no earthly inducement, in the slave’s condition, to incite him\r\nto labor faithfully. The fear of punishment is the sole motive for any\r\nsort of industry, with him. Knowing this fact, as the slaveholder does,\r\nand judging the slave by himself, he naturally concludes the slave will\r\nbe idle whenever the cause for this fear is absent. Hence, all sorts of\r\npetty deceptions are practiced, to inspire this fear.\r\n\r\nBut, with Mr. Covey, trickery was natural. Everything in the shape of\r\nlearning or religion, which he possessed, was made to conform to this\r\nsemi-lying propensity. He did not seem conscious that the practice had\r\nanything unmanly, base or contemptible about it. It was a part of an\r\nimportant system, with him, essential to the relation of master and\r\nslave. I thought I saw, in his very religious devotions, this\r\ncontrolling element of his character. A long prayer at night made up\r\nfor the short prayer in the morning; and few men could seem more\r\ndevotional than he, when he had nothing else to do.\r\n\r\nMr. Covey was not content with the cold style of family worship,\r\nadopted in these cold latitudes, which begin and end with a simple\r\nprayer. No! the voice of praise, as well as of prayer, must be heard in\r\nhis house, night and morning. At first, I was called upon to bear some\r\npart in these exercises; but the repeated flogging given me by Covey,\r\nturned the whole thing into mockery. He was a poor singer, and mainly\r\nrelied on me for raising the hymn for the family, and when I failed to\r\ndo so, he was thrown into much confusion. I do not think that he ever\r\nabused me on account of these vexations. His religion was a thing\r\naltogether apart from his worldly concerns. He knew nothing of it as a\r\nholy principle, directing and controlling his daily life, making the\r\nlatter conform to the requirements of the gospel. One or two facts will\r\nillustrate his character better than a volume of generalties(sic).\r\n\r\nI have already said, or implied, that Mr. Edward Covey was a poor man.\r\nHe was, in fact, just commencing to lay the foundation of his fortune,\r\nas fortune is regarded in a slave state. The first condition of wealth\r\nand respectability there, being the ownership of human property, every\r\nnerve is strained, by the poor man, to obtain it, and very little\r\nregard is had to the manner of obtaining it. In pursuit of this object,\r\npious as Mr. Covey was, he proved himself to be as unscrupulous and\r\nbase as the worst of his neighbors. In the beginning, he was only\r\nable—as he said—“to buy one slave;” and, scandalous and shocking as is\r\nthe fact, he boasted that he bought her simply “_as a breeder_.” But\r\nthe worst is not told in this naked statement. This young woman\r\n(Caroline was her name) was virtually compelled by Mr. Covey to abandon\r\nherself to the object for which he had purchased her; and the result\r\nwas, the birth of twins at the end of the year. At this addition to his\r\nhuman stock, both Edward Covey and his wife, Susan, were ecstatic with\r\njoy. No one dreamed of reproaching the woman, or of finding fault with\r\nthe hired man—Bill Smith—the father of the children, for Mr. Covey\r\nhimself had locked the two up together every night, thus inviting the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nBut I will pursue this revolting subject no further. No better\r\nillustration of the unchaste and demoralizing character of slavery can\r\nbe found, than is furnished in the fact that this professedly Christian\r\nslaveholder, amidst all his prayers and hymns, was shamelessly and\r\nboastfully encouraging, and actually compelling, in his own house,\r\nundisguised and unmitigated fornication, as a means of increasing his\r\nhuman stock. I may remark here, that, while this fact will be read with\r\ndisgust and shame at the north, it will be _laughed at_, as smart and\r\npraiseworthy in Mr. Covey, at the south; for a man is no more condemned\r\nthere for buying a woman and devoting her to this life of dishonor,\r\nthan for buying a cow, and raising stock from her. The same rules are\r\nobserved, with a view to increasing the number and quality of the\r\nformer, as of the latter.\r\n\r\nI will here reproduce what I said of my own experience in this wretched\r\nplace, more than ten years ago:\r\n\r\nIf at any one time of my life, more than another, I was made to drink\r\nthe bitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six\r\nmonths of my stay with Mr. Covey. We were worked all weathers. It was\r\nnever too hot or too cold; it could never rain, blow, snow, or hail too\r\nhard for us to work in the field. Work, work, work, was scarcely more\r\nthe order of the day than the night. The longest days were too short\r\nfor him, and the shortest nights were too long for him. I was somewhat\r\nunmanageable when I first went there; but a few months of his\r\ndiscipline tamed me. Mr. Covey succeeded in breaking me. I was broken\r\nin body, soul and spirit. My natural elasticity was crushed; my\r\nintellect languished; the disposition to read departed; the cheerful\r\nspark that lingered about my eye died; the dark night of slavery closed\r\nin upon me; and behold a man transformed into a brute!\r\n\r\nSunday was my only leisure time. I spent this in a sort of beast-like\r\nstupor, between sleep and wake, under some large tree. At times, I\r\nwould rise up, a flash of energetic freedom would dart through my soul,\r\naccompanied with a faint beam of hope, flickered for a moment, and then\r\nvanished. I sank down again, mourning over my wretched condition. I was\r\nsometimes prompted to take my life, and that of Covey, but was\r\nprevented by a combination of hope and fear. My sufferings on this\r\nplantation seem now like a dream rather than a stern reality.\r\n\r\nOur house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake bay, whose broad\r\nbosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable\r\nglobe. Those beautiful vessels, robed in purest white, so delightful to\r\nthe eye of freemen, were to me so many shrouded ghosts, to terrify and\r\ntorment me with thoughts of my wretched condition. I have often, in the\r\ndeep stillness of a summer’s Sabbath, stood all alone upon the banks of\r\nthat noble bay, and traced, with saddened heart and tearful eye, the\r\ncountless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean. The sight of\r\nthese always affected me powerfully. My thoughts would compel\r\nutterance; and there, with no audience but the Almighty, I would pour\r\nout my soul’s complaint in my rude way, with an apostrophe to the\r\nmoving multitude of ships:\r\n\r\n“You are loosed from your moorings, and free; I am fast in my chains,\r\nand am a slave! You move merrily before the gentle gale, and I sadly\r\nbefore the bloody whip! You are freedom’s swift-winged angels, that fly\r\naround the world; I am confined in bands of iron! O, that I were free!\r\nO, that I were on one of your gallant decks, and under your protecting\r\nwing! Alas! betwixt me and you the turbid waters roll. Go on, go on. O\r\nthat I could also go! Could I but swim! If I could fly! O, why was I\r\nborn a man, of whom to make a brute! The glad ship is gone; she hides\r\nin the dim distance. I am left in the hottest hell of unending slavery.\r\nO God, save me! God, deliver me! Let me be free! Is there any God? Why\r\nam I a slave? I will run away. I will not stand it. Get caught, or get\r\nclear, I’ll try it. I had as well die with ague as with fever. I have\r\nonly one life to lose. I had as well be killed running as die standing.\r\nOnly think of it; one hundred miles straight north, and I am free! Try\r\nit? Yes! God helping me, I will. It cannot be that I shall live and die\r\na slave. I will take to the water. This very bay shall yet bear me into\r\nfreedom. The steamboats steered in a north-east coast from North Point.\r\nI will do the same; and when I get to the head of the bay, I will turn\r\nmy canoe adrift, and walk straight through Delaware into Pennsylvania.\r\nWhen I get there, I shall not be required to have a pass; I will travel\r\nwithout being disturbed. Let but the first opportunity offer, and come\r\nwhat will, I am off. Meanwhile, I will try to bear up under the yoke. I\r\nam not the only slave in the world. Why should I fret? I can bear as\r\nmuch as any of them. Besides, I am but a boy, and all boys are bound to\r\nsome one. It may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my\r\nhappiness when I get free. There is a better day coming.”\r\n\r\nI shall never be able to narrate the mental experience through which it\r\nwas my lot to pass during my stay at Covey’s. I was completely wrecked,\r\nchanged and bewildered; goaded almost to madness at one time, and at\r\nanother reconciling myself to my wretched condition. Everything in the\r\nway of kindness, which I had experienced at Baltimore; all my former\r\nhopes and aspirations for usefulness in the world, and the happy\r\nmoments spent in the exercises of religion, contrasted with my then\r\npresent lot, but increased my anguish.\r\n\r\nI suffered bodily as well as mentally. I had neither sufficient time in\r\nwhich to eat or to sleep, except on Sundays. The overwork, and the\r\nbrutal chastisements of which I was the victim, combined with that\r\never-gnawing and soul-devouring thought—“_I am a slave—a slave for\r\nlife—a slave with no rational ground to hope for freedom_”—rendered me\r\na living embodiment of mental and physical wretchedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. _Another Pressure of the Tyrant’s Vice_\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE AT COVEY’S SUMMED UP—FIRST SIX MONTHS SEVERER THAN THE\r\nSECOND—PRELIMINARIES TO THE CHANCE—REASONS FOR NARRATING THE\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES—SCENE IN TREADING YARD—TAKEN ILL—UNUSUAL BRUTALITY OF\r\nCOVEY—ESCAPE TO ST. MICHAEL’S—THE PURSUIT—SUFFERING IN THE WOODS—DRIVEN\r\nBACK AGAIN TO COVEY’S—BEARING OF MASTER THOMAS—THE SLAVE IS NEVER\r\nSICK—NATURAL TO EXPECT SLAVES TO FEIGN SICKNESS—LAZINESS OF\r\nSLAVEHOLDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing chapter, with all its horrid incidents and shocking\r\nfeatures, may be taken as a fair representation of the first six months\r\nof my life at Covey’s. The reader has but to repeat, in his own mind,\r\nonce a week, the scene in the woods, where Covey subjected me to his\r\nmerciless lash, to have a true idea of my bitter experience there,\r\nduring the first period of the breaking process through which Mr. Covey\r\ncarried me. I have no heart to repeat each separate transaction, in\r\nwhich I was victim of his violence and brutality. Such a narration\r\nwould fill a volume much larger than the present one. I aim only to\r\ngive the reader a truthful impression of my slave life, without\r\nunnecessarily affecting him with harrowing details.\r\n\r\nAs I have elsewhere intimated that my hardships were much greater\r\nduring the first six months of my stay at Covey’s, than during the\r\nremainder of the year, and as the change in my condition was owing to\r\ncauses which may help the reader to a better understanding of human\r\nnature, when subjected to the terrible extremities of slavery, I will\r\nnarrate the circumstances of this change, although I may seem thereby\r\nto applaud my own courage. You have, dear reader, seen me humbled,\r\ndegraded, broken down, enslaved, and brutalized, and you understand how\r\nit was done; now let us see the converse of all this, and how it was\r\nbrought about; and this will take us through the year 1834.\r\n\r\nOn one of the hottest days of the month of August, of the year just\r\nmentioned, had the reader been passing through Covey’s farm, he might\r\nhave seen me at work, in what is there called the “treading yard”—a\r\nyard upon which wheat is trodden out from the straw, by the horses’\r\nfeet. I was there, at work, feeding the “fan,” or rather bringing wheat\r\nto the fan, while Bill Smith was feeding. Our force consisted of Bill\r\nHughes, Bill Smith, and a slave by the name of Eli; the latter having\r\nbeen hired for this occasion. The work was simple, and required\r\nstrength and activity, rather than any skill or intelligence, and yet,\r\nto one entirely unused to such work, it came very hard. The heat was\r\nintense and overpowering, and there was much hurry to get the wheat,\r\ntrodden out that day, through the fan; since, if that work was done an\r\nhour before sundown, the hands would have, according to a promise of\r\nCovey, that hour added to their night’s rest. I was not behind any of\r\nthem in the wish to complete the day’s work before sundown, and, hence,\r\nI struggled with all my might to get the work forward. The promise of\r\none hour’s repose on a week day, was sufficient to quicken my pace, and\r\nto spur me on to extra endeavor. Besides, we had all planned to go\r\nfishing, and I certainly wished to have a hand in that. But I was\r\ndisappointed, and the day turned out to be one of the bitterest I ever\r\nexperienced. About three o’clock, while the sun was pouring down his\r\nburning rays, and not a breeze was stirring, I broke down; my strength\r\nfailed me; I was seized with a violent aching of the head, attended\r\nwith extreme dizziness, and trembling in every limb. Finding what was\r\ncoming, and feeling it would never do to stop work, I nerved myself up,\r\nand staggered on until I fell by the side of the wheat fan, feeling\r\nthat the earth had fallen upon me. This brought the entire work to a\r\ndead stand. There was work for four; each one had his part to perform,\r\nand each part depended on the other, so that when one stopped, all were\r\ncompelled to stop. Covey, who had now become my dread, as well as my\r\ntormentor, was at the house, about a hundred yards from where I was\r\nfanning, and instantly, upon hearing the fan stop, he came down to the\r\ntreading yard, to inquire into the cause of our stopping. Bill Smith\r\ntold him I was sick, and that I was unable longer to bring wheat to the\r\nfan.\r\n\r\nI had, by this time, crawled away, under the side of a post-and-rail\r\nfence, in the shade, and was exceeding ill. The intense heat of the\r\nsun, the heavy dust rising from the fan, the stooping, to take up the\r\nwheat from the yard, together with the hurrying, to get through, had\r\ncaused a rush of blood to my head. In this condition, Covey finding out\r\nwhere I was, came to me; and, after standing over me a while, he asked\r\nme what the matter was. I told him as well as I could, for it was with\r\ndifficulty that I could speak. He then gave me a savage kick in the\r\nside, which jarred my whole frame, and commanded me to get up. The man\r\nhad obtained complete control over me; and if he had commanded me to do\r\nany possible thing, I should, in my then state of mind, have endeavored\r\nto comply. I made an effort to rise, but fell back in the attempt,\r\nbefore gaining my feet. The brute now gave me another heavy kick, and\r\nagain told me to rise. I again tried to rise, and succeeded in gaining\r\nmy feet; but upon stooping to get the tub with which I was feeding the\r\nfan, I again staggered and fell to the ground; and I must have so\r\nfallen, had I been sure that a hundred bullets would have pierced me,\r\nas the consequence. While down, in this sad condition, and perfectly\r\nhelpless, the merciless Negro breaker took up the hickory slab, with\r\nwhich Hughes had been striking off the wheat to a level with the sides\r\nof the half bushel measure (a very hard weapon) and with the sharp edge\r\nof it, he dealt me a heavy blow on my head which made a large gash, and\r\ncaused the blood to run freely, saying, at the same time, “If _you have\r\ngot the headache, I’ll cure you_.” This done, he ordered me again to\r\nrise, but I made no effort to do so; for I had made up my mind that it\r\nwas useless, and that the heartless monster might now do his worst; he\r\ncould but kill me, and that might put me out of my misery. Finding me\r\nunable to rise, or rather despairing of my doing so, Covey left me,\r\nwith a view to getting on with the work without me. I was bleeding very\r\nfreely, and my face was soon covered with my warm blood. Cruel and\r\nmerciless as was the motive that dealt that blow, dear reader, the\r\nwound was fortunate for me. Bleeding was never more efficacious. The\r\npain in my head speedily abated, and I was soon able to rise. Covey\r\nhad, as I have said, now left me to my fate; and the question was,\r\nshall I return to my work, or shall I find my way to St. Michael’s, and\r\nmake Capt. Auld acquainted with the atrocious cruelty of his brother\r\nCovey, and beseech him to get me another master? Remembering the object\r\nhe had in view, in placing me under the management of Covey, and\r\nfurther, his cruel treatment of my poor crippled cousin, Henny, and his\r\nmeanness in the matter of feeding and clothing his slaves, there was\r\nlittle ground to hope for a favorable reception at the hands of Capt.\r\nThomas Auld. Nevertheless, I resolved to go straight to Capt. Auld,\r\nthinking that, if not animated by motives of humanity, he might be\r\ninduced to interfere on my behalf from selfish considerations. “He\r\ncannot,” thought I, “allow his property to be thus bruised and\r\nbattered, marred and defaced; and I will go to him, and tell him the\r\nsimple truth about the matter.” In order to get to St. Michael’s, by\r\nthe most favorable and direct road, I must walk seven miles; and this,\r\nin my sad condition, was no easy performance. I had already lost much\r\nblood; I was exhausted by over exertion; my sides were sore from the\r\nheavy blows planted there by the stout boots of Mr. Covey; and I was,\r\nin every way, in an unfavorable plight for the journey. I however\r\nwatched my chance, while the cruel and cunning Covey was looking in an\r\nopposite direction, and started off, across the field, for St.\r\nMichael’s. This was a daring step; if it failed, it would only\r\nexasperate Covey, and increase the rigors of my bondage, during the\r\nremainder of my term of service under him; but the step was taken, and\r\nI must go forward. I succeeded in getting nearly half way across the\r\nbroad field, toward the woods, before Mr. Covey observed me. I was\r\nstill bleeding, and the exertion of running had started the blood\r\nafresh. _“Come back! Come back!”_ vociferated Covey, with threats of\r\nwhat he would do if I did not return instantly. But, disregarding his\r\ncalls and his threats, I pressed on toward the woods as fast as my\r\nfeeble state would allow. Seeing no signs of my stopping, Covey caused\r\nhis horse to be brought out and saddled, as if he intended to pursue\r\nme. The race was now to be an unequal one; and, thinking I might be\r\noverhauled by him, if I kept the main road, I walked nearly the whole\r\ndistance in the woods, keeping far enough from the road to avoid\r\ndetection and pursuit. But, I had not gone far, before my little\r\nstrength again failed me, and I laid down. The blood was still oozing\r\nfrom the wound in my head; and, for a time, I suffered more than I can\r\ndescribe. There I was, in the deep woods, sick and emaciated, pursued\r\nby a wretch whose character for revolting cruelty beggars all\r\nopprobrious speech—bleeding, and almost bloodless. I was not without\r\nthe fear of bleeding to death. The thought of dying in the woods, all\r\nalone, and of being torn to pieces by the buzzards, had not yet been\r\nrendered tolerable by my many troubles and hardships, and I was glad\r\nwhen the shade of the trees, and the cool evening breeze, combined with\r\nmy matted hair to stop the flow of blood. After lying there about three\r\nquarters of an hour, brooding over the singular and mournful lot to\r\nwhich I was doomed, my mind passing over the whole scale or circle of\r\nbelief and unbelief, from faith in the overruling providence of God, to\r\nthe blackest atheism, I again took up my journey toward St. Michael’s,\r\nmore weary and sad than in the morning when I left Thomas Auld’s for\r\nthe home of Mr. Covey. I was bare-footed and bare-headed, and in my\r\nshirt sleeves. The way was through bogs and briers, and I tore my feet\r\noften during the journey. I was full five hours in going the seven or\r\neight miles; partly, because of the difficulties of the way, and\r\npartly, because of the feebleness induced by my illness, bruises and\r\nloss of blood. On gaining my master’s store, I presented an appearance\r\nof wretchedness and woe, fitted to move any but a heart of stone. From\r\nthe crown of my head to the sole of my feet, there were marks of blood.\r\nMy hair was all clotted with dust and blood, and the back of my shirt\r\nwas literally stiff with the same. Briers and thorns had scarred and\r\ntorn my feet and legs, leaving blood marks there. Had I escaped from a\r\nden of tigers, I could not have looked worse than I did on reaching St.\r\nMichael’s. In this unhappy plight, I appeared before my professedly\r\n_Christian_ master, humbly to invoke the interposition of his power and\r\nauthority, to protect me from further abuse and violence. I had begun\r\nto hope, during the latter part of my tedious journey toward St.\r\nMichael’s, that Capt. Auld would now show himself in a nobler light\r\nthan I had ever before seen him. I was disappointed. I had jumped from\r\na sinking ship into the sea; I had fled from the tiger to something\r\nworse. I told him all the circumstances, as well as I could; how I was\r\nendeavoring to please Covey; how hard I was at work in the present\r\ninstance; how unwilling I sunk down under the heat, toil and pain; the\r\nbrutal manner in which Covey had kicked me in the side; the gash cut in\r\nmy head; my hesitation about troubling him (Capt. Auld) with\r\ncomplaints; but, that now I felt it would not be best longer to conceal\r\nfrom him the outrages committed on me from time to time by Covey. At\r\nfirst, master Thomas seemed somewhat affected by the story of my\r\nwrongs, but he soon repressed his feelings and became cold as iron. It\r\nwas impossible—as I stood before him at the first—for him to seem\r\nindifferent. I distinctly saw his human nature asserting its conviction\r\nagainst the slave system, which made cases like mine _possible;_ but,\r\nas I have said, humanity fell before the systematic tyranny of slavery.\r\nHe first walked the floor, apparently much agitated by my story, and\r\nthe sad spectacle I presented; but, presently, it was _his_ turn to\r\ntalk. He began moderately, by finding excuses for Covey, and ending\r\nwith a full justification of him, and a passionate condemnation of me.\r\n“He had no doubt I deserved the flogging. He did not believe I was\r\nsick; I was only endeavoring to get rid of work. My dizziness was\r\nlaziness, and Covey did right to flog me, as he had done.” After thus\r\nfairly annihilating me, and rousing himself by his own eloquence, he\r\nfiercely demanded what I wished _him_ to do in the case!\r\n\r\nWith such a complete knock-down to all my hopes, as he had given me,\r\nand feeling, as I did, my entire subjection to his power, I had very\r\nlittle heart to reply. I must not affirm my innocence of the\r\nallegations which he had piled up against me; for that would be\r\nimpudence, and would probably call down fresh violence as well as wrath\r\nupon me. The guilt of a slave is always, and everywhere, presumed; and\r\nthe innocence of the slaveholder or the slave employer, is always\r\nasserted. The word of the slave, against this presumption, is generally\r\ntreated as impudence, worthy of punishment. “Do you contradict me, you\r\nrascal?” is a final silencer of counter statements from the lips of a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nCalming down a little in view of my silence and hesitation, and,\r\nperhaps, from a rapid glance at the picture of misery I presented, he\r\ninquired again, “what I would have him do?” Thus invited a second time,\r\nI told Master Thomas I wished him to allow me to get a new home and to\r\nfind a new master; that, as sure as I went back to live with Mr. Covey\r\nagain, I should be killed by him; that he would never forgive my coming\r\nto him (Capt. Auld) with a complaint against him (Covey); that, since I\r\nhad lived with him, he almost crushed my spirit, and I believed that he\r\nwould ruin me for future service; that my life was not safe in his\r\nhands. This, Master Thomas _(my brother in the church)_ regarded as\r\n“nonsence(sic).” “There was no danger of Mr. Covey’s killing me; he was\r\na good man, industrious and religious, and he would not think of\r\nremoving me from that home; besides,” said he and this I found was the\r\nmost distressing thought of all to him—“if you should leave Covey now,\r\nthat your year has but half expired, I should lose your wages for the\r\nentire year. You belong to Mr. Covey for one year, and you _must go\r\nback_ to him, come what will. You must not trouble me with any more\r\nstories about Mr. Covey; and if you do not go immediately home, I will\r\nget hold of you myself.” This was just what I expected, when I found he\r\nhad _prejudged_ the case against me. “But, Sir,” I said, “I am sick and\r\ntired, and I cannot get home to-night.” At this, he again relented, and\r\nfinally he allowed me to remain all night at St. Michael’s; but said I\r\nmust be off early in the morning, and concluded his directions by\r\nmaking me swallow a huge dose of _epsom salts_—about the only medicine\r\never administered to slaves.\r\n\r\nIt was quite natural for Master Thomas to presume I was feigning\r\nsickness to escape work, for he probably thought that were _he_ in the\r\nplace of a slave with no wages for his work, no praise for well doing,\r\nno motive for toil but the lash—he would try every possible scheme by\r\nwhich to escape labor. I say I have no doubt of this; the reason is,\r\nthat there are not, under the whole heavens, a set of men who cultivate\r\nsuch an intense dread of labor as do the slaveholders. The charge of\r\nlaziness against the slave is ever on their lips, and is the standing\r\napology for every species of cruelty and brutality. These men literally\r\n“bind heavy burdens, grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s\r\nshoulders; but they, themselves, will not move them with one of their\r\nfingers.”\r\n\r\nMy kind readers shall have, in the next chapter—what they were led,\r\nperhaps, to expect to find in this—namely: an account of my partial\r\ndisenthrallment from the tyranny of Covey, and the marked change which\r\nit brought about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. _The Last Flogging_\r\n\r\n\r\nA SLEEPLESS NIGHT—RETURN TO COVEY’S—PURSUED BY COVEY—THE CHASE\r\nDEFEATED—VENGEANCE POSTPONED—MUSINGS IN THE WOODS—THE\r\nALTERNATIVE—DEPLORABLE SPECTACLE—NIGHT IN THE WOODS—EXPECTED\r\nATTACK—ACCOSTED BY SANDY, A FRIEND, NOT A HUNTER—SANDY’S\r\nHOSPITALITY—THE “ASH CAKE” SUPPER—THE INTERVIEW WITH SANDY—HIS\r\nADVICE—SANDY A CONJURER AS WELL AS A CHRISTIAN—THE MAGIC ROOT—STRANGE\r\nMEETING WITH COVEY—HIS MANNER—COVEY’S SUNDAY FACE—MY DEFENSIVE\r\nRESOLVE—THE FIGHT—THE VICTORY, AND ITS RESULTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSleep itself does not always come to the relief of the weary in body,\r\nand the broken in spirit; especially when past troubles only foreshadow\r\ncoming disasters. The last hope had been extinguished. My master, who I\r\ndid not venture to hope would protect me as _a man_, had even now\r\nrefused to protect me as _his property;_ and had cast me back, covered\r\nwith reproaches and bruises, into the hands of a stranger to that mercy\r\nwhich was the soul of the religion he professed. May the reader never\r\nspend such a night as that allotted to me, previous to the morning\r\nwhich was to herald my return to the den of horrors from which I had\r\nmade a temporary escape.\r\n\r\nI remained all night—sleep I did not—at St. Michael’s; and in the\r\nmorning (Saturday) I started off, according to the order of Master\r\nThomas, feeling that I had no friend on earth, and doubting if I had\r\none in heaven. I reached Covey’s about nine o’clock; and just as I\r\nstepped into the field, before I had reached the house, Covey, true to\r\nhis snakish habits, darted out at me from a fence corner, in which he\r\nhad secreted himself, for the purpose of securing me. He was amply\r\nprovided with a cowskin and a rope; and he evidently intended to _tie\r\nme up_, and to wreak his vengeance on me to the fullest extent. I\r\nshould have been an easy prey, had he succeeded in getting his hands\r\nupon me, for I had taken no refreshment since noon on Friday; and this,\r\ntogether with the pelting, excitement, and the loss of blood, had\r\nreduced my strength. I, however, darted back into the woods, before the\r\nferocious hound could get hold of me, and buried myself in a thicket,\r\nwhere he lost sight of me. The corn-field afforded me cover, in getting\r\nto the woods. But for the tall corn, Covey would have overtaken me, and\r\nmade me his captive. He seemed very much chagrined that he did not\r\ncatch me, and gave up the chase, very reluctantly; for I could see his\r\nangry movements, toward the house from which he had sallied, on his\r\nforay.\r\n\r\nWell, now I am clear of Covey, and of his wrathful lash, for present. I\r\nam in the wood, buried in its somber gloom, and hushed in its solemn\r\nsilence; hid from all human eyes; shut in with nature and nature’s God,\r\nand absent from all human contrivances. Here was a good place to pray;\r\nto pray for help for deliverance—a prayer I had often made before. But\r\nhow could I pray? Covey could pray—Capt. Auld could pray—I would fain\r\npray; but doubts (arising partly from my own neglect of the means of\r\ngrace, and partly from the sham religion which everywhere prevailed,\r\ncast in my mind a doubt upon all religion, and led me to the conviction\r\nthat prayers were unavailing and delusive) prevented my embracing the\r\nopportunity, as a religious one. Life, in itself, had almost become\r\nburdensome to me. All my outward relations were against me; I must stay\r\nhere and starve (I was already hungry) or go home to Covey’s, and have\r\nmy flesh torn to pieces, and my spirit humbled under the cruel lash of\r\nCovey. This was the painful alternative presented to me. The day was\r\nlong and irksome. My physical condition was deplorable. I was weak,\r\nfrom the toils of the previous day, and from the want of food and rest;\r\nand had been so little concerned about my appearance, that I had not\r\nyet washed the blood from my garments. I was an object of horror, even\r\nto myself. Life, in Baltimore, when most oppressive, was a paradise to\r\nthis. What had I done, what had my parents done, that such a life as\r\nthis should be mine? That day, in the woods, I would have exchanged my\r\nmanhood for the brutehood of an ox.\r\n\r\nNight came. I was still in the woods, unresolved what to do. Hunger had\r\nnot yet pinched me to the point of going home, and I laid myself down\r\nin the leaves to rest; for I had been watching for hunters all day, but\r\nnot being molested during the day, I expected no disturbance during the\r\nnight. I had come to the conclusion that Covey relied upon hunger to\r\ndrive me home; and in this I was quite correct—the facts showed that he\r\nhad made no effort to catch me, since morning.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, I heard the step of a man in the woods. He was coming\r\ntoward the place where I lay. A person lying still has the advantage\r\nover one walking in the woods, in the day time, and this advantage is\r\nmuch greater at night. I was not able to engage in a physical struggle,\r\nand I had recourse to the common resort of the weak. I hid myself in\r\nthe leaves to prevent discovery. But, as the night rambler in the woods\r\ndrew nearer, I found him to be a _friend_, not an enemy; it was a slave\r\nof Mr. William Groomes, of Easton, a kind hearted fellow, named\r\n“Sandy.” Sandy lived with Mr. Kemp that year, about four miles from St.\r\nMichael’s. He, like myself had been hired out by the year; but, unlike\r\nmyself, had not been hired out to be broken. Sandy was the husband of a\r\nfree woman, who lived in the lower part of _“Potpie Neck,”_ and he was\r\nnow on his way through the woods, to see her, and to spend the Sabbath\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had ascertained that the disturber of my solitude was not\r\nan enemy, but the good-hearted Sandy—a man as famous among the slaves\r\nof the neighborhood for his good nature, as for his good sense I came\r\nout from my hiding place, and made myself known to him. I explained the\r\ncircumstances of the past two days, which had driven me to the woods,\r\nand he deeply compassionated my distress. It was a bold thing for him\r\nto shelter me, and I could not ask him to do so; for, had I been found\r\nin his hut, he would have suffered the penalty of thirty-nine lashes on\r\nhis bare back, if not something worse. But Sandy was too generous to\r\npermit the fear of punishment to prevent his relieving a brother\r\nbondman from hunger and exposure; and, therefore, on his own motion, I\r\naccompanied him to his home, or rather to the home of his wife—for the\r\nhouse and lot were hers. His wife was called up—for it was now about\r\nmidnight—a fire was made, some Indian meal was soon mixed with salt and\r\nwater, and an ash cake was baked in a hurry to relieve my hunger.\r\nSandy’s wife was not behind him in kindness—both seemed to esteem it a\r\nprivilege to succor me; for, although I was hated by Covey and by my\r\nmaster, I was loved by the colored people, because _they_ thought I was\r\nhated for my knowledge, and persecuted because I was feared. I was the\r\n_only_ slave _now_ in that region who could read and write. There had\r\nbeen one other man, belonging to Mr. Hugh Hamilton, who could read (his\r\nname was “Jim”), but he, poor fellow, had, shortly after my coming into\r\nthe neighborhood, been sold off to the far south. I saw Jim ironed, in\r\nthe cart, to be carried to Easton for sale—pinioned like a yearling for\r\nthe slaughter. My knowledge was now the pride of my brother slaves;\r\nand, no doubt, Sandy felt something of the general interest in me on\r\nthat account. The supper was soon ready, and though I have feasted\r\nsince, with honorables, lord mayors and aldermen, over the sea, my\r\nsupper on ash cake and cold water, with Sandy, was the meal, of all my\r\nlife, most sweet to my taste, and now most vivid in my memory.\r\n\r\nSupper over, Sandy and I went into a discussion of what was _possible_\r\nfor me, under the perils and hardships which now overshadowed my path.\r\nThe question was, must I go back to Covey, or must I now tempt to run\r\naway? Upon a careful survey, the latter was found to be impossible; for\r\nI was on a narrow neck of land, every avenue from which would bring me\r\nin sight of pursuers. There was the Chesapeake bay to the right, and\r\n“Pot-pie” river to the left, and St. Michael’s and its neighborhood\r\noccupying the only space through which there was any retreat.\r\n\r\nI found Sandy an old advisor. He was not only a religious man, but he\r\nprofessed to believe in a system for which I have no name. He was a\r\ngenuine African, and had inherited some of the so-called magical\r\npowers, said to be possessed by African and eastern nations. He told me\r\nthat he could help me; that, in those very woods, there was an herb,\r\nwhich in the morning might be found, possessing all the powers required\r\nfor my protection (I put his thoughts in my own language); and that, if\r\nI would take his advice, he would procure me the root of the herb of\r\nwhich he spoke. He told me further, that if I would take that root and\r\nwear it on my right side, it would be impossible for Covey to strike me\r\na blow; that with this root about my person, no white man could whip\r\nme. He said he had carried it for years, and that he had fully tested\r\nits virtues. He had never received a blow from a slaveholder since he\r\ncarried it; and he never expected to receive one, for he always meant\r\nto carry that root as a protection. He knew Covey well, for Mrs. Covey\r\nwas the daughter of Mr. Kemp; and he (Sandy) had heard of the barbarous\r\ntreatment to which I was subjected, and he wanted to do something for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nNow all this talk about the root, was to me, very absurd and\r\nridiculous, if not positively sinful. I at first rejected the idea that\r\nthe simple carrying a root on my right side (a root, by the way, over\r\nwhich I walked every time I went into the woods) could possess any such\r\nmagic power as he ascribed to it, and I was, therefore, not disposed to\r\ncumber my pocket with it. I had a positive aversion to all pretenders\r\nto _“divination.”_ It was beneath one of my intelligence to countenance\r\nsuch dealings with the devil, as this power implied. But, with all my\r\nlearning—it was really precious little—Sandy was more than a match for\r\nme. “My book learning,” he said, “had not kept Covey off me” (a\r\npowerful argument just then) and he entreated me, with flashing eyes,\r\nto try this. If it did me no good, it could do me no harm, and it would\r\ncost me nothing, any way. Sandy was so earnest, and so confident of the\r\ngood qualities of this weed, that, to please him, rather than from any\r\nconviction of its excellence, I was induced to take it. He had been to\r\nme the good Samaritan, and had, almost providentially, found me, and\r\nhelped me when I could not help myself; how did I know but that the\r\nhand of the Lord was in it? With thoughts of this sort, I took the\r\nroots from Sandy, and put them in my right hand pocket.\r\n\r\nThis was, of course, Sunday morning. Sandy now urged me to go home,\r\nwith all speed, and to walk up bravely to the house, as though nothing\r\nhad happened. I saw in Sandy too deep an insight into human nature,\r\nwith all his superstition, not to have some respect for his advice; and\r\nperhaps, too, a slight gleam or shadow of his superstition had fallen\r\nupon me. At any rate, I started off toward Covey’s, as directed by\r\nSandy. Having, the previous night, poured my griefs into Sandy’s ears,\r\nand got him enlisted in my behalf, having made his wife a sharer in my\r\nsorrows, and having, also, become well refreshed by sleep and food, I\r\nmoved off, quite courageously, toward the much dreaded Covey’s.\r\nSingularly enough, just as I entered his yard gate, I met him and his\r\nwife, dressed in their Sunday best—looking as smiling as angels—on\r\ntheir way to church. The manner of Covey astonished me. There was\r\nsomething really benignant in his countenance. He spoke to me as never\r\nbefore; told me that the pigs had got into the lot, and he wished me to\r\ndrive them out; inquired how I was, and seemed an altered man. This\r\nextraordinary conduct of Covey, really made me begin to think that\r\nSandy’s herb had more virtue in it than I, in my pride, had been\r\nwilling to allow; and, had the day been other than Sunday, I should\r\nhave attributed Covey’s altered manner solely to the magic power of the\r\nroot. I suspected, however, that the _Sabbath_, and not the _root_, was\r\nthe real explanation of Covey’s manner. His religion hindered him from\r\nbreaking the Sabbath, but not from breaking my skin. He had more\r\nrespect for the _day_ than for the _man_, for whom the day was\r\nmercifully given; for while he would cut and slash my body during the\r\nweek, he would not hesitate, on Sunday, to teach me the value of my\r\nsoul, or the way of life and salvation by Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nAll went well with me till Monday morning; and then, whether the root\r\nhad lost its virtue, or whether my tormentor had gone deeper into the\r\nblack art than myself (as was sometimes said of him), or whether he had\r\nobtained a special indulgence, for his faithful Sabbath day’s worship,\r\nit is not necessary for me to know, or to inform the reader; but, this\r\nI _may_ say—the pious and benignant smile which graced Covey’s face on\r\n_Sunday_, wholly disappeared on _Monday_. Long before daylight, I was\r\ncalled up to go and feed, rub, and curry the horses. I obeyed the call,\r\nand would have so obeyed it, had it been made at an earilier(sic) hour,\r\nfor I had brought my mind to a firm resolve, during that Sunday’s\r\nreflection, viz: to obey every order, however unreasonable, if it were\r\npossible, and, if Mr. Covey should then undertake to beat me, to defend\r\nand protect myself to the best of my ability. My religious views on the\r\nsubject of resisting my master, had suffered a serious shock, by the\r\nsavage persecution to which I had been subjected, and my hands were no\r\nlonger tied by my religion. Master Thomas’s indifference had served the\r\nlast link. I had now to this extent “backslidden” from this point in\r\nthe slave’s religious creed; and I soon had occasion to make my fallen\r\nstate known to my Sunday-pious brother, Covey.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was obeying his order to feed and get the horses ready for the\r\nfield, and when in the act of going up the stable loft for the purpose\r\nof throwing down some blades, Covey sneaked into the stable, in his\r\npeculiar snake-like way, and seizing me suddenly by the leg, he brought\r\nme to the stable floor, giving my newly mended body a fearful jar. I\r\nnow forgot my roots, and remembered my pledge to _stand up in my own\r\ndefense_. The brute was endeavoring skillfully to get a slip-knot on my\r\nlegs, before I could draw up my feet. As soon as I found what he was up\r\nto, I gave a sudden spring (my two day’s rest had been of much service\r\nto me,) and by that means, no doubt, he was able to bring me to the\r\nfloor so heavily. He was defeated in his plan of tying me. While down,\r\nhe seemed to think he had me very securely in his power. He little\r\nthought he was—as the rowdies say—“in” for a “rough and tumble” fight;\r\nbut such was the fact. Whence came the daring spirit necessary to\r\ngrapple with a man who, eight-and-forty hours before, could, with his\r\nslightest word have made me tremble like a leaf in a storm, I do not\r\nknow; at any rate, _I was resolved to fight_, and, what was better\r\nstill, I was actually hard at it. The fighting madness had come upon\r\nme, and I found my strong fingers firmly attached to the throat of my\r\ncowardly tormentor; as heedless of consequences, at the moment, as\r\nthough we stood as equals before the law. The very color of the man was\r\nforgotten. I felt as supple as a cat, and was ready for the snakish\r\ncreature at every turn. Every blow of his was parried, though I dealt\r\nno blows in turn. I was strictly on the _defensive_, preventing him\r\nfrom injuring me, rather than trying to injure him. I flung him on the\r\nground several times, when he meant to have hurled me there. I held him\r\nso firmly by the throat, that his blood followed my nails. He held me,\r\nand I held him.\r\n\r\nAll was fair, thus far, and the contest was about equal. My resistance\r\nwas entirely unexpected, and Covey was taken all aback by it, for he\r\ntrembled in every limb. _“Are you going to resist_, you scoundrel?”\r\nsaid he. To which, I returned a polite _“Yes sir;”_ steadily gazing my\r\ninterrogator in the eye, to meet the first approach or dawning of the\r\nblow, which I expected my answer would call forth. But, the conflict\r\ndid not long remain thus equal. Covey soon cried out lustily for help;\r\nnot that I was obtaining any marked advantage over him, or was injuring\r\nhim, but because he was gaining none over me, and was not able, single\r\nhanded, to conquer me. He called for his cousin Hughs, to come to his\r\nassistance, and now the scene was changed. I was compelled to give\r\nblows, as well as to parry them; and, since I was, in any case, to\r\nsuffer for resistance, I felt (as the musty proverb goes) that “I might\r\nas well be hanged for an old sheep as a lamb.” I was still _defensive_\r\ntoward Covey, but _aggressive_ toward Hughs; and, at the first approach\r\nof the latter, I dealt a blow, in my desperation, which fairly sickened\r\nmy youthful assailant. He went off, bending over with pain, and\r\nmanifesting no disposition to come within my reach again. The poor\r\nfellow was in the act of trying to catch and tie my right hand, and\r\nwhile flattering himself with success, I gave him the kick which sent\r\nhim staggering away in pain, at the same time that I held Covey with a\r\nfirm hand.\r\n\r\nTaken completely by surprise, Covey seemed to have lost his usual\r\nstrength and coolness. He was frightened, and stood puffing and\r\nblowing, seemingly unable to command words or blows. When he saw that\r\npoor Hughes was standing half bent with pain—his courage quite gone the\r\ncowardly tyrant asked if I “meant to persist in my resistance.” I told\r\nhim “_I did mean to resist, come what might_;” that I had been by him\r\ntreated like a _brute_, during the last six months; and that I should\r\nstand it _no longer_. With that, he gave me a shake, and attempted to\r\ndrag me toward a stick of wood, that was lying just outside the stable\r\ndoor. He meant to knock me down with it; but, just as he leaned over to\r\nget the stick, I seized him with both hands by the collar, and, with a\r\nvigorous and sudden snatch, I brought my assailant harmlessly, his full\r\nlength, on the _not_ overclean ground—for we were now in the cow yard.\r\nHe had selected the place for the fight, and it was but right that he\r\nshould have all the advantges(sic) of his own selection.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Bill, the hiredman, came home. He had been to Mr.\r\nHemsley’s, to spend the Sunday with his nominal wife, and was coming\r\nhome on Monday morning, to go to work. Covey and I had been skirmishing\r\nfrom before daybreak, till now, that the sun was almost shooting his\r\nbeams over the eastern woods, and we were still at it. I could not see\r\nwhere the matter was to terminate. He evidently was afraid to let me\r\ngo, lest I should again make off to the woods; otherwise, he would\r\nprobably have obtained arms from the house, to frighten me. Holding me,\r\nCovey called upon Bill for assistance. The scene here, had something\r\ncomic about it. “Bill,” who knew _precisely_ what Covey wished him to\r\ndo, affected ignorance, and pretended he did not know what to do. “What\r\nshall I do, Mr. Covey,” said Bill. “Take hold of him—take hold of him!”\r\nsaid Covey. With a toss of his head, peculiar to Bill, he said,\r\n“indeed, Mr. Covey I want to go to work.” _“This is_ your work,” said\r\nCovey; “take hold of him.” Bill replied, with spirit, “My master hired\r\nme here, to work, and _not_ to help you whip Frederick.” It was now my\r\nturn to speak. “Bill,” said I, “don’t put your hands on me.” To which\r\nhe replied, “My GOD! Frederick, I ain’t goin’ to tech ye,” and Bill\r\nwalked off, leaving Covey and myself to settle our matters as best we\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nBut, my present advantage was threatened when I saw Caroline (the\r\nslave-woman of Covey) coming to the cow yard to milk, for she was a\r\npowerful woman, and could have mastered me very easily, exhausted as I\r\nnow was. As soon as she came into the yard, Covey attempted to rally\r\nher to his aid. Strangely—and, I may add, fortunately—Caroline was in\r\nno humor to take a hand in any such sport. We were all in open\r\nrebellion, that morning. Caroline answered the command of her master to\r\n_“take hold of me,”_ precisely as Bill had answered, but in _her_, it\r\nwas at greater peril so to answer; she was the slave of Covey, and he\r\ncould do what he pleased with her. It was _not_ so with Bill, and Bill\r\nknew it. Samuel Harris, to whom Bill belonged, did not allow his slaves\r\nto be beaten, unless they were guilty of some crime which the law would\r\npunish. But, poor Caroline, like myself, was at the mercy of the\r\nmerciless Covey; nor did she escape the dire effects of her refusal. He\r\ngave her several sharp blows.\r\n\r\nCovey at length (two hours had elapsed) gave up the contest. Letting me\r\ngo, he said—puffing and blowing at a great rate—“Now, you scoundrel, go\r\nto your work; I would not have whipped you half so much as I have had\r\nyou not resisted.” The fact was, _he had not whipped me at all_. He had\r\nnot, in all the scuffle, drawn a single drop of blood from me. I had\r\ndrawn blood from him; and, even without this satisfaction, I should\r\nhave been victorious, because my aim had not been to injure him, but to\r\nprevent his injuring me.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole six months that I lived with Covey, after this\r\ntransaction, he never laid on me the weight of his finger in anger. He\r\nwould, occasionally, say he did not want to have to get hold of me\r\nagain—a declaration which I had no difficulty in believing; and I had a\r\nsecret feeling, which answered, “You need not wish to get hold of me\r\nagain, for you will be likely to come off worse in a second fight than\r\nyou did in the first.”\r\n\r\nWell, my dear reader, this battle with Mr. Covey—undignified as it was,\r\nand as I fear my narration of it is—was the turning point in my _“life\r\nas a slave_.” It rekindled in my breast the smouldering embers of\r\nliberty; it brought up my Baltimore dreams, and revived a sense of my\r\nown manhood. I was a changed being after that fight. I was _nothing_\r\nbefore; I WAS A MAN NOW. It recalled to life my crushed self-respect\r\nand my self-confidence, and inspired me with a renewed determination to\r\nbe A FREEMAN. A man, without force, is without the essential dignity of\r\nhumanity. Human nature is so constituted, that it cannot _honor_ a\r\nhelpless man, although it can _pity_ him; and even this it cannot do\r\nlong, if the signs of power do not arise.\r\n\r\nHe can only understand the effect of this combat on my spirit, who has\r\nhimself incurred something, hazarded something, in repelling the unjust\r\nand cruel aggressions of a tyrant. Covey was a tyrant, and a cowardly\r\none, withal. After resisting him, I felt as I had never felt before. It\r\nwas a resurrection from the dark and pestiferous tomb of slavery, to\r\nthe heaven of comparative freedom. I was no longer a servile coward,\r\ntrembling under the frown of a brother worm of the dust, but, my\r\nlong-cowed spirit was roused to an attitude of manly independence. I\r\nhad reached the point, at which I was _not afraid to die_. This spirit\r\nmade me a freeman in _fact_, while I remained a slave in _form_. When a\r\nslave cannot be flogged he is more than half free. He has a domain as\r\nbroad as his own manly heart to defend, and he is really _“a power on\r\nearth_.” While slaves prefer their lives, with flogging, to instant\r\ndeath, they will always find Christians enough, like unto Covey, to\r\naccommodate that preference. From this time, until that of my escape\r\nfrom slavery, I was never fairly whipped. Several attempts were made to\r\nwhip me, but they were always unsuccessful. Bruises I did get, as I\r\nshall hereafter inform the reader; but the case I have been describing,\r\nwas the end of the brutification to which slavery had subjected me.\r\n\r\nThe reader will be glad to know why, after I had so grievously offended\r\nMr. Covey, he did not have me taken in hand by the authorities; indeed,\r\nwhy the law of Maryland, which assigns hanging to the slave who resists\r\nhis master, was not put in force against me; at any rate, why I was not\r\ntaken up, as is usual in such cases, and publicly whipped, for an\r\nexample to other slaves, and as a means of deterring me from committing\r\nthe same offense again. I confess, that the easy manner in which I got\r\noff, for a long time, a surprise to me, and I cannot, even now, fully\r\nexplain the cause.\r\n\r\nThe only explanation I can venture to suggest, is the fact, that Covey\r\nwas, probably, ashamed to have it known and confessed that he had been\r\nmastered by a boy of sixteen. Mr. Covey enjoyed the unbounded and very\r\nvaluable reputation, of being a first rate overseer and _Negro\r\nbreaker_. By means of this reputation, he was able to procure his hands\r\nfor _very trifling_ compensation, and with very great ease. His\r\ninterest and his pride mutually suggested the wisdom of passing the\r\nmatter by, in silence. The story that he had undertaken to whip a lad,\r\nand had been resisted, was, of itself, sufficient to damage him; for\r\nhis bearing should, in the estimation of slaveholders, be of that\r\nimperial order that should make such an occurrence _impossible_. I\r\njudge from these circumstances, that Covey deemed it best to give me\r\nthe go-by. It is, perhaps, not altogether creditable to my natural\r\ntemper, that, after this conflict with Mr. Covey, I did, at times,\r\npurposely aim to provoke him to an attack, by refusing to keep with the\r\nother hands in the field, but I could never bully him to another\r\nbattle. I had made up my mind to do him serious damage, if he ever\r\nagain attempted to lay violent hands on me.\r\n\r\nHereditary bondmen, know ye not\r\nWho would be free, themselves must strike the blow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. _New Relations and Duties_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF MASTERS—BENEFITS DERIVED BY THE CHANGE—FAME OF THE FIGHT WITH\r\nCOVEY—RECKLESS UNCONCERN—MY ABHORRENCE OF SLAVERY—ABILITY TO READ A\r\nCAUSE OF PREJUDICE—THE HOLIDAYS—HOW SPENT—SHARP HIT AT SLAVERY—EFFECTS\r\nOF HOLIDAYS—A DEVICE OF SLAVERY—DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COVEY AND\r\nFREELAND—AN IRRELIGIOUS MASTER PREFERRED TO A RELIGIOUS ONE—CATALOGUE\r\nOF FLOGGABLE OFFENSES—HARD LIFE AT COVEY’S USEFUL—IMPROVED CONDITION\r\nNOT FOLLOWED BY CONTENTMENT—CONGENIAL SOCIETY AT FREELAND’S—SABBATH\r\nSCHOOL INSTITUTED—SECRECY NECESSARY—AFFECTIONATE RELATIONS OF TUTOR AND\r\nPUPILS—CONFIDENCE AND FRIENDSHIP AMONG SLAVES—I DECLINE PUBLISHING\r\nPARTICULARS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH MY FRIENDS—SLAVERY THE INVITER OF\r\nVENGEANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy term of actual service to Mr. Edward Covey ended on Christmas day,\r\n1834. I gladly left the snakish Covey, although he was now as gentle as\r\na lamb. My home for the year 1835 was already secured—my next master\r\nwas already selected. There is always more or less excitement about the\r\nmatter of changing hands, but I had become somewhat reckless. I cared\r\nvery little into whose hands I fell—I meant to fight my way. Despite of\r\nCovey, too, the report got abroad, that I was hard to whip; that I was\r\nguilty of kicking back; that though generally a good tempered Negro, I\r\nsometimes “_got the devil in me_.” These sayings were rife in Talbot\r\ncounty, and they distinguished me among my servile brethren. Slaves,\r\ngenerally, will fight each other, and die at each other’s hands; but\r\nthere are few who are not held in awe by a white man. Trained from the\r\ncradle up, to think and feel that their masters are superior, and\r\ninvested with a sort of sacredness, there are few who can outgrow or\r\nrise above the control which that sentiment exercises. I had now got\r\nfree from it, and the thing was known. One bad sheep will spoil a whole\r\nflock. Among the slaves, I was a bad sheep. I hated slavery,\r\nslaveholders, and all pertaining to them; and I did not fail to inspire\r\nothers with the same feeling, wherever and whenever opportunity was\r\npresented. This made me a marked lad among the slaves, and a suspected\r\none among the slaveholders. A knowledge of my ability to read and\r\nwrite, got pretty widely spread, which was very much against me.\r\n\r\nThe days between Christmas day and New Year’s, are allowed the slaves\r\nas holidays. During these days, all regular work was suspended, and\r\nthere was nothing to do but to keep fires, and look after the stock.\r\nThis time was regarded as our own, by the grace of our masters, and we,\r\ntherefore used it, or abused it, as we pleased. Those who had families\r\nat a distance, were now expected to visit them, and to spend with them\r\nthe entire week. The younger slaves, or the unmarried ones, were\r\nexpected to see to the cattle, and attend to incidental duties at home.\r\nThe holidays were variously spent. The sober, thinking and industrious\r\nones of our number, would employ themselves in manufacturing corn\r\nbrooms, mats, horse collars and baskets, and some of these were very\r\nwell made. Another class spent their time in hunting opossums, coons,\r\nrabbits, and other game. But the majority spent the holidays in sports,\r\nball playing, wrestling, boxing, running foot races, dancing, and\r\ndrinking whisky; and this latter mode of spending the time was\r\ngenerally most agreeable to their masters. A slave who would work\r\nduring the holidays, was thought, by his master, undeserving of\r\nholidays. Such an one had rejected the favor of his master. There was,\r\nin this simple act of continued work, an accusation against slaves; and\r\na slave could not help thinking, that if he made three dollars during\r\nthe holidays, he might make three hundred during the year. Not to be\r\ndrunk during the holidays, was disgraceful; and he was esteemed a lazy\r\nand improvident man, who could not afford to drink whisky during\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\nThe fiddling, dancing and _“jubilee beating_,” was going on in all\r\ndirections. This latter performance is strictly southern. It supplies\r\nthe place of a violin, or of other musical instruments, and is played\r\nso easily, that almost every farm has its “Juba” beater. The performer\r\nimprovises as he beats, and sings his merry songs, so ordering the\r\nwords as to have them fall pat with the movement of his hands. Among a\r\nmass of nonsense and wild frolic, once in a while a sharp hit is given\r\nto the meanness of slaveholders. Take the following, for an example:\r\n\r\n_We raise de wheat,\r\nDey gib us de corn;\r\nWe bake de bread,\r\nDey gib us de cruss;\r\nWe sif de meal,\r\nDey gib us de huss;\r\nWe peal de meat,\r\nDey gib us de skin,\r\nAnd dat’s de way\r\nDey takes us in.\r\nWe skim de pot,\r\nDey gib us the liquor,\r\nAnd say dat’s good enough for nigger.\r\n          Walk over! walk over!\r\nTom butter and de fat;\r\n          Poor nigger you can’t get over dat;\r\n                              Walk over_!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not a bad summary of the palpable injustice and fraud of\r\nslavery, giving—as it does—to the lazy and idle, the comforts which God\r\ndesigned should be given solely to the honest laborer. But to the\r\nholiday’s.\r\n\r\nJudging from my own observation and experience, I believe these\r\nholidays to be among the most effective means, in the hands of\r\nslaveholders, of keeping down the spirit of insurrection among the\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nTo enslave men, successfully and safely, it is necessary to have their\r\nminds occupied with thoughts and aspirations short of the liberty of\r\nwhich they are deprived. A certain degree of attainable good must be\r\nkept before them. These holidays serve the purpose of keeping the minds\r\nof the slaves occupied with prospective pleasure, within the limits of\r\nslavery. The young man can go wooing; the married man can visit his\r\nwife; the father and mother can see their children; the industrious and\r\nmoney loving can make a few dollars; the great wrestler can win\r\nlaurels; the young people can meet, and enjoy each other’s society; the\r\ndrunken man can get plenty of whisky; and the religious man can hold\r\nprayer meetings, preach, pray and exhort during the holidays. Before\r\nthe holidays, these are pleasures in prospect; after the holidays, they\r\nbecome pleasures of memory, and they serve to keep out thoughts and\r\nwishes of a more dangerous character. Were slaveholders at once to\r\nabandon the practice of allowing their slaves these liberties,\r\nperiodically, and to keep them, the year round, closely confined to the\r\nnarrow circle of their homes, I doubt not that the south would blaze\r\nwith insurrections. These holidays are conductors or safety valves to\r\ncarry off the explosive elements inseparable from the human mind, when\r\nreduced to the condition of slavery. But for these, the rigors of\r\nbondage would become too severe for endurance, and the slave would be\r\nforced up to dangerous desperation. Woe to the slaveholder when he\r\nundertakes to hinder or to prevent the operation of these electric\r\nconductors. A succession of earthquakes would be less destructive, than\r\nthe insurrectionary fires which would be sure to burst forth in\r\ndifferent parts of the south, from such interference.\r\n\r\nThus, the holidays, became part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrongs\r\nand inhumanity of slavery. Ostensibly, they are institutions of\r\nbenevolence, designed to mitigate the rigors of slave life, but,\r\npractically, they are a fraud, instituted by human selfishness, the\r\nbetter to secure the ends of injustice and oppression. The slave’s\r\nhappiness is not the end sought, but, rather, the master’s safety. It\r\nis not from a generous unconcern for the slave’s labor that this\r\ncessation from labor is allowed, but from a prudent regard to the\r\nsafety of the slave system. I am strengthened in this opinion, by the\r\nfact, that most slaveholders like to have their slaves spend the\r\nholidays in such a manner as to be of no real benefit to the slaves. It\r\nis plain, that everything like rational enjoyment among the slaves, is\r\nfrowned upon; and only those wild and low sports, peculiar to\r\nsemi-civilized people, are encouraged. All the license allowed, appears\r\nto have no other object than to disgust the slaves with their temporary\r\nfreedom, and to make them as glad to return to their work, as they were\r\nto leave it. By plunging them into exhausting depths of drunkenness and\r\ndissipation, this effect is almost certain to follow. I have known\r\nslaveholders resort to cunning tricks, with a view of getting their\r\nslaves deplorably drunk. A usual plan is, to make bets on a slave, that\r\nhe can drink more whisky than any other; and so to induce a rivalry\r\namong them, for the mastery in this degradation. The scenes, brought\r\nabout in this way, were often scandalous and loathsome in the extreme.\r\nWhole multitudes might be found stretched out in brutal drunkenness, at\r\nonce helpless and disgusting. Thus, when the slave asks for a few hours\r\nof virtuous freedom, his cunning master takes advantage of his\r\nignorance, and cheers him with a dose of vicious and revolting\r\ndissipation, artfully labeled with the name of LIBERTY. We were induced\r\nto drink, I among the rest, and when the holidays were over, we all\r\nstaggered up from our filth and wallowing, took a long breath, and went\r\naway to our various fields of work; feeling, upon the whole, rather\r\nglad to go from that which our masters artfully deceived us into the\r\nbelief was freedom, back again to the arms of slavery. It was not what\r\nwe had taken it to be, nor what it might have been, had it not been\r\nabused by us. It was about as well to be a slave to _master_, as to be\r\na slave to _rum_ and _whisky._\r\n\r\nI am the more induced to take this view of the holiday system, adopted\r\nby slaveholders, from what I know of their treatment of slaves, in\r\nregard to other things. It is the commonest thing for them to try to\r\ndisgust their slaves with what they do not want them to have, or to\r\nenjoy. A slave, for instance, likes molasses; he steals some; to cure\r\nhim of the taste for it, his master, in many cases, will go away to\r\ntown, and buy a large quantity of the _poorest_ quality, and set it\r\nbefore his slave, and, with whip in hand, compel him to eat it, until\r\nthe poor fellow is made to sicken at the very thought of molasses. The\r\nsame course is often adopted to cure slaves of the disagreeable and\r\ninconvenient practice of asking for more food, when their allowance has\r\nfailed them. The same disgusting process works well, too, in other\r\nthings, but I need not cite them. When a slave is drunk, the\r\nslaveholder has no fear that he will plan an insurrection; no fear that\r\nhe will escape to the north. It is the sober, thinking slave who is\r\ndangerous, and needs the vigilance of his master, to keep him a slave.\r\nBut, to proceed with my narrative.\r\n\r\nOn the first of January, 1835, I proceeded from St. Michael’s to Mr.\r\nWilliam Freeland’s, my new home. Mr. Freeland lived only three miles\r\nfrom St. Michael’s, on an old worn out farm, which required much labor\r\nto restore it to anything like a self-supporting establishment.\r\n\r\nI was not long in finding Mr. Freeland to be a very different man from\r\nMr. Covey. Though not rich, Mr. Freeland was what may be called a\r\nwell-bred southern gentleman, as different from Covey, as a\r\nwell-trained and hardened Negro breaker is from the best specimen of\r\nthe first families of the south. Though Freeland was a slaveholder, and\r\nshared many of the vices of his class, he seemed alive to the sentiment\r\nof honor. He had some sense of justice, and some feelings of humanity.\r\nHe was fretful, impulsive and passionate, but I must do him the justice\r\nto say, he was free from the mean and selfish characteristics which\r\ndistinguished the creature from which I had now, happily, escaped. He\r\nwas open, frank, imperative, and practiced no concealments, disdaining\r\nto play the spy. In all this, he was the opposite of the crafty Covey.\r\n\r\nAmong the many advantages gained in my change from Covey’s to\r\nFreeland’s—startling as the statement may be—was the fact that the\r\nlatter gentleman made no profession of religion. I assert _most\r\nunhesitatingly_, that the religion of the south—as I have observed it\r\nand proved it—is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes; the\r\njustifier of the most appalling barbarity; a sanctifier of the most\r\nhateful frauds; and a secure shelter, under which the darkest, foulest,\r\ngrossest, and most infernal abominations fester and flourish. Were I\r\nagain to be reduced to the condition of a slave, _next_ to that\r\ncalamity, I should regard the fact of being the slave of a religious\r\nslaveholder, the greatest that could befall me. For all slaveholders\r\nwith whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders are the worst. I have\r\nfound them, almost invariably, the vilest, meanest and basest of their\r\nclass. Exceptions there may be, but this is true of religious\r\nslaveholders, _as a class_. It is not for me to explain the fact.\r\nOthers may do that; I simply state it as a fact, and leave the\r\ntheological, and psychological inquiry, which it raises, to be decided\r\nby others more competent than myself. Religious slaveholders, like\r\nreligious persecutors, are ever extreme in their malice and violence.\r\nVery near my new home, on an adjoining farm, there lived the Rev.\r\nDaniel Weeden, who was both pious and cruel after the real Covey\r\npattern. Mr. Weeden was a local preacher of the Protestant Methodist\r\npersuasion, and a most zealous supporter of the ordinances of religion,\r\ngenerally. This Weeden owned a woman called “Ceal,” who was a standing\r\nproof of his mercilessness. Poor Ceal’s back, always scantily clothed,\r\nwas kept literally raw, by the lash of this religious man and gospel\r\nminister. The most notoriously wicked man—so called in distinction from\r\nchurch members—could hire hands more easily than this brute. When sent\r\nout to find a home, a slave would never enter the gates of the preacher\r\nWeeden, while a sinful sinner needed a hand. Be have ill, or behave\r\nwell, it was the known maxim of Weeden, that it is the duty of a master\r\nto use the lash. If, for no other reason, he contended that this was\r\nessential to remind a slave of his condition, and of his master’s\r\nauthority. The good slave must be whipped, to be _kept_ good, and the\r\nbad slave must be whipped, to be _made_ good. Such was Weeden’s theory,\r\nand such was his practice. The back of his slave-woman will, in the\r\njudgment, be the swiftest witness against him.\r\n\r\nWhile I am stating particular cases, I might as well immortalize\r\nanother of my neighbors, by calling him by name, and putting him in\r\nprint. He did not think that a “chiel” was near, “taking notes,” and\r\nwill, doubtless, feel quite angry at having his character touched off\r\nin the ragged style of a slave’s pen. I beg to introduce the reader to\r\nREV. RIGBY HOPKINS. Mr. Hopkins resides between Easton and St.\r\nMichael’s, in Talbot county, Maryland. The severity of this man made\r\nhim a perfect terror to the slaves of his neighborhood. The peculiar\r\nfeature of his government, was, his system of whipping slaves, as he\r\nsaid, _in advance_ of deserving it. He always managed to have one or\r\ntwo slaves to whip on Monday morning, so as to start his hands to their\r\nwork, under the inspiration of a new assurance on Monday, that his\r\npreaching about kindness, mercy, brotherly love, and the like, on\r\nSunday, did not interfere with, or prevent him from establishing his\r\nauthority, by the cowskin. He seemed to wish to assure them, that his\r\ntears over poor, lost and ruined sinners, and his pity for them, did\r\nnot reach to the blacks who tilled his fields. This saintly Hopkins\r\nused to boast, that he was the best hand to manage a Negro in the\r\ncounty. He whipped for the smallest offenses, by way of preventing the\r\ncommission of large ones.\r\n\r\nThe reader might imagine a difficulty in finding faults enough for such\r\nfrequent whipping. But this is because you have no idea how easy a\r\nmatter it is to offend a man who is on the look-out for offenses. The\r\nman, unaccustomed to slaveholding, would be astonished to observe how\r\nmany _foggable_ offenses there are in the slaveholder’s catalogue of\r\ncrimes; and how easy it is to commit any one of them, even when the\r\nslave least intends it. A slaveholder, bent on finding fault, will\r\nhatch up a dozen a day, if he chooses to do so, and each one of these\r\nshall be of a punishable description. A mere look, word, or motion, a\r\nmistake, accident, or want of power, are all matters for which a slave\r\nmay be whipped at any time. Does a slave look dissatisfied with his\r\ncondition? It is said, that he has the devil in him, and it must be\r\nwhipped out. Does he answer _loudly_, when spoken to by his master,\r\nwith an air of self-consciousness? Then, must he be taken down a\r\nbutton-hole lower, by the lash, well laid on. Does he forget, and omit\r\nto pull off his hat, when approaching a white person? Then, he must, or\r\nmay be, whipped for his bad manners. Does he ever venture to vindicate\r\nhis conduct, when harshly and unjustly accused? Then, he is guilty of\r\nimpudence, one of the greatest crimes in the social catalogue of\r\nsouthern society. To allow a slave to escape punishment, who has\r\nimpudently attempted to exculpate himself from unjust charges,\r\npreferred against him by some white person, is to be guilty of great\r\ndereliction of duty. Does a slave ever venture to suggest a better way\r\nof doing a thing, no matter what? He is, altogether, too officious—wise\r\nabove what is written—and he deserves, even if he does not get, a\r\nflogging for his presumption. Does he, while plowing, break a plow, or\r\nwhile hoeing, break a hoe, or while chopping, break an ax? No matter\r\nwhat were the imperfections of the implement broken, or the natural\r\nliabilities for breaking, the slave can be whipped for carelessness.\r\nThe _reverend_ slaveholder could always find something of this sort, to\r\njustify him in using the lash several times during the week.\r\nHopkins—like Covey and Weeden—were shunned by slaves who had the\r\nprivilege (as many had) of finding their own masters at the end of each\r\nyear; and yet, there was not a man in all that section of country, who\r\nmade a louder profession of religion, than did MR. RIGBY HOPKINS.\r\n\r\nBut, to continue the thread of my story, through my experience when at\r\nMr. William Freeland’s.\r\n\r\nMy poor, weather-beaten bark now reached smoother water, and gentler\r\nbreezes. My stormy life at Covey’s had been of service to me. The\r\nthings that would have seemed very hard, had I gone direct to Mr.\r\nFreeland’s, from the home of Master Thomas, were now (after the\r\nhardships at Covey’s) “trifles light as air.” I was still a field hand,\r\nand had come to prefer the severe labor of the field, to the enervating\r\nduties of a house servant. I had become large and strong; and had begun\r\nto take pride in the fact, that I could do as much hard work as some of\r\nthe older men. There is much rivalry among slaves, at times, as to\r\nwhich can do the most work, and masters generally seek to promote such\r\nrivalry. But some of us were too wise to race with each other very\r\nlong. Such racing, we had the sagacity to see, was not likely to pay.\r\nWe had our times for measuring each other’s strength, but we knew too\r\nmuch to keep up the competition so long as to produce an extraordinary\r\nday’s work. We knew that if, by extraordinary exertion, a large\r\nquantity of work was done in one day, the fact, becoming known to the\r\nmaster, might lead him to require the same amount every day. This\r\nthought was enough to bring us to a dead halt when over so much excited\r\nfor the race.\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Freeland’s, my condition was every way improved. I was no longer\r\nthe poor scape-goat that I was when at Covey’s, where every wrong thing\r\ndone was saddled upon me, and where other slaves were whipped over my\r\nshoulders. Mr. Freeland was too just a man thus to impose upon me, or\r\nupon any one else.\r\n\r\nIt is quite usual to make one slave the object of especial abuse, and\r\nto beat him often, with a view to its effect upon others, rather than\r\nwith any expectation that the slave whipped will be improved by it, but\r\nthe man with whom I now was, could descend to no such meanness and\r\nwickedness. Every man here was held individually responsible for his\r\nown conduct.\r\n\r\nThis was a vast improvement on the rule at Covey’s. There, I was the\r\ngeneral pack horse. Bill Smith was protected, by a positive prohibition\r\nmade by his rich master, and the command of the rich slaveholder is LAW\r\nto the poor one; Hughes was favored, because of his relationship to\r\nCovey; and the hands hired temporarily, escaped flogging, except as\r\nthey got it over my poor shoulders. Of course, this comparison refers\r\nto the time when Covey _could_ whip me.\r\n\r\nMr. Freeland, like Mr. Covey, gave his hands enough to eat, but, unlike\r\nMr. Covey, he gave them time to take their meals; he worked us hard\r\nduring the day, but gave us the night for rest—another advantage to be\r\nset to the credit of the sinner, as against that of the saint. We were\r\nseldom in the field after dark in the evening, or before sunrise in the\r\nmorning. Our implements of husbandry were of the most improved pattern,\r\nand much superior to those used at Covey’s.\r\n\r\nNothwithstanding the improved condition which was now mine, and the\r\nmany advantages I had gained by my new home, and my new master, I was\r\nstill restless and discontented. I was about as hard to please by a\r\nmaster, as a master is by slave. The freedom from bodily torture and\r\nunceasing labor, had given my mind an increased sensibility, and\r\nimparted to it greater activity. I was not yet exactly in right\r\nrelations. “How be it, that was not first which is spiritual, but that\r\nwhich is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual.” When entombed\r\nat Covey’s, shrouded in darkness and physical wretchedness, temporal\r\nwellbeing was the grand _desideratum;_ but, temporal wants supplied,\r\nthe spirit puts in its claims. Beat and cuff your slave, keep him\r\nhungry and spiritless, and he will follow the chain of his master like\r\na dog; but, feed and clothe him well—work him moderately—surround him\r\nwith physical comfort—and dreams of freedom intrude. Give him a _bad_\r\nmaster, and he aspires to a _good_ master; give him a good master, and\r\nhe wishes to become his _own_ master. Such is human nature. You may\r\nhurl a man so low, beneath the level of his kind, that he loses all\r\njust ideas of his natural position; but elevate him a little, and the\r\nclear conception of rights arises to life and power, and leads him\r\nonward. Thus elevated, a little, at Freeland’s, the dreams called into\r\nbeing by that good man, Father Lawson, when in Baltimore, began to\r\nvisit me; and shoots from the tree of liberty began to put forth tender\r\nbuds, and dim hopes of the future began to dawn.\r\n\r\nI found myself in congenial society, at Mr. Freeland’s. There were\r\nHenry Harris, John Harris, Handy Caldwell, and Sandy Jenkins. 6\r\n\r\nHenry and John were brothers, and belonged to Mr. Freeland. They were\r\nboth remarkably bright and intelligent, though neither of them could\r\nread. Now for mischief! I had not been long at Freeland’s before I was\r\nup to my old tricks. I early began to address my companions on the\r\nsubject of education, and the advantages of intelligence over\r\nignorance, and, as far as I dared, I tried to show the agency of\r\nignorance in keeping men in slavery. Webster’s spelling book and the\r\n_Columbian Orator_ were looked into again. As summer came on, and the\r\nlong Sabbath days stretched themselves over our idleness, I became\r\nuneasy, and wanted a Sabbath school, in which to exercise my gifts, and\r\nto impart the little knowledge of letters which I possessed, to my\r\nbrother slaves. A house was hardly necessary in the summer time; I\r\ncould hold my school under the shade of an old oak tree, as well as any\r\nwhere else. The thing was, to get the scholars, and to have them\r\nthoroughly imbued with the desire to learn. Two such boys were quickly\r\nsecured, in Henry and John, and from them the contagion spread. I was\r\nnot long bringing around me twenty or thirty young men, who enrolled\r\nthemselves, gladly, in my Sabbath school, and were willing to meet me\r\nregularly, under the trees or elsewhere, for the purpose of learning to\r\nread. It was surprising with what ease they provided themselves with\r\nspelling books. These were mostly the cast off books of their young\r\nmasters or mistresses. I taught, at first, on our own farm. All were\r\nimpressed with the necessity of keeping the matter as private as\r\npossible, for the fate of the St. Michael’s attempt was notorious, and\r\nfresh in the minds of all. Our pious masters, at St. Michael’s, must\r\nnot know that a few of their dusky brothers were learning to read the\r\nword of God, lest they should come down upon us with the lash and\r\nchain. We might have met to drink whisky, to wrestle, fight, and to do\r\nother unseemly things, with no fear of interruption from the saints or\r\nsinners of St. Michael’s.\r\n\r\nBut, to meet for the purpose of improving the mind and heart, by\r\nlearning to read the sacred scriptures, was esteemed a most dangerous\r\nnuisance, to be instantly stopped. The slaveholders of St. Michael’s,\r\nlike slaveholders elsewhere, would always prefer to see the slaves\r\nengaged in degrading sports, rather than to see them acting like moral\r\nand accountable beings.\r\n\r\nHad any one asked a religious white man, in St. Michael’s, twenty years\r\nago, the names of three men in that town, whose lives were most after\r\nthe pattern of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, the first three would\r\nhave been as follows:\r\n\r\nGARRISON WEST, _Class Leader_.\r\nWRIGHT FAIRBANKS, _Class Leader_.\r\nTHOMAS AULD, _Class Leader_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet, these were men who ferociously rushed in upon my Sabbath\r\nschool, at St. Michael’s, armed with mob-like missiles, and I must say,\r\nI thought him a Christian, until he took part in bloody by the lash.\r\nThis same Garrison West was my class leader, and I must say, I thought\r\nhim a Christian, until he took part in breaking up my school. He led me\r\nno more after that. The plea for this outrage was then, as it is now\r\nand at all times—the danger to good order. If the slaves learnt to\r\nread, they would learn something else, and something worse. The peace\r\nof slavery would be disturbed; slave rule would be endangered. I leave\r\nthe reader to characterize a system which is endangered by such causes.\r\nI do not dispute the soundness of the reasoning. It is perfectly sound;\r\nand, if slavery be _right_, Sabbath schools for teaching slaves to read\r\nthe bible are _wrong_, and ought to be put down. These Christian class\r\nleaders were, to this extent, consistent. They had settled the\r\nquestion, that slavery is _right_, and, by that standard, they\r\ndetermined that Sabbath schools are wrong. To be sure, they were\r\nProtestant, and held to the great Protestant right of every man to\r\n_“search the scriptures”_ for himself; but, then, to all general rules,\r\nthere are _exceptions_. How convenient! What crimes may not be\r\ncommitted under the doctrine of the last remark. But, my dear, class\r\nleading Methodist brethren, did not condescend to give me a reason for\r\nbreaking up the Sabbath school at St. Michael’s; it was enough that\r\nthey had determined upon its destruction. I am, however, digressing.\r\n\r\nAfter getting the school cleverly into operation, the second time\r\nholding it in the woods, behind the barn, and in the shade of trees—I\r\nsucceeded in inducing a free colored man, who lived several miles from\r\nour house, to permit me to hold my school in a room at his house. He,\r\nvery kindly, gave me this liberty; but he incurred much peril in doing\r\nso, for the assemblage was an unlawful one. I shall not mention, here,\r\nthe name of this man; for it might, even now, subject him to\r\npersecution, although the offenses were committed more than twenty\r\nyears ago. I had, at one time, more than forty scholars, all of the\r\nright sort; and many of them succeeded in learning to read. I have met\r\nseveral slaves from Maryland, who were once my scholars; and who\r\nobtained their freedom, I doubt not, partly in consequence of the ideas\r\nimparted to them in that school. I have had various employments during\r\nmy short life; but I look back to _none_ with more satisfaction, than\r\nto that afforded by my Sunday school. An attachment, deep and lasting,\r\nsprung up between me and my persecuted pupils, which made parting from\r\nthem intensely grievous; and, when I think that most of these dear\r\nsouls are yet shut up in this abject thralldom, I am overwhelmed with\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\nBesides my Sunday school, I devoted three evenings a week to my fellow\r\nslaves, during the winter. Let the reader reflect upon the fact, that,\r\nin this christian country, men and women are hiding from professors of\r\nreligion, in barns, in the woods and fields, in order to learn to read\r\nthe _holy bible_. Those dear souls, who came to my Sabbath school, came\r\n_not_ because it was popular or reputable to attend such a place, for\r\nthey came under the liability of having forty stripes laid on their\r\nnaked backs. Every moment they spend in my school, they were under this\r\nterrible liability; and, in this respect, I was sharer with them. Their\r\nminds had been cramped and starved by their cruel masters; the light of\r\neducation had been completely excluded; and their hard earnings had\r\nbeen taken to educate their master’s children. I felt a delight in\r\ncircumventing the tyrants, and in blessing the victims of their curses.\r\n\r\nThe year at Mr. Freeland’s passed off very smoothly, to outward\r\nseeming. Not a blow was given me during the whole year. To the credit\r\nof Mr. Freeland—irreligious though he was—it must be stated, that he\r\nwas the best master I ever had, until I became my own master, and\r\nassumed for myself, as I had a right to do, the responsibility of my\r\nown existence and the exercise of my own powers. For much of the\r\nhappiness—or absence of misery—with which I passed this year with Mr.\r\nFreeland, I am indebted to the genial temper and ardent friendship of\r\nmy brother slaves. They were, every one of them, manly, generous and\r\nbrave, yes; I say they were brave, and I will add, fine looking. It is\r\nseldom the lot of mortals to have truer and better friends than were\r\nthe slaves on this farm. It is not uncommon to charge slaves with great\r\ntreachery toward each other, and to believe them incapable of confiding\r\nin each other; but I must say, that I never loved, esteemed, or\r\nconfided in men, more than I did in these. They were as true as steel,\r\nand no band of brothers could have been more loving. There were no mean\r\nadvantages taken of each other, as is sometimes the case where slaves\r\nare situated as we were; no tattling; no giving each other bad names to\r\nMr. Freeland; and no elevating one at the expense of the other. We\r\nnever undertook to do any thing, of any importance, which was likely to\r\naffect each other, without mutual consultation. We were generally a\r\nunit, and moved together. Thoughts and sentiments were exchanged\r\nbetween us, which might well be called very incendiary, by oppressors\r\nand tyrants; and perhaps the time has not even now come, when it is\r\nsafe to unfold all the flying suggestions which arise in the minds of\r\nintelligent slaves. Several of my friends and brothers, if yet alive,\r\nare still in some part of the house of bondage; and though twenty years\r\nhave passed away, the suspicious malice of slavery might punish them\r\nfor even listening to my thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe slaveholder, kind or cruel, is a slaveholder still—the every hour\r\nviolator of the just and inalienable rights of man; and he is,\r\ntherefore, every hour silently whetting the knife of vengeance for his\r\nown throat. He never lisps a syllable in commendation of the fathers of\r\nthis republic, nor denounces any attempted oppression of himself,\r\nwithout inviting the knife to his own throat, and asserting the rights\r\nof rebellion for his own slaves.\r\n\r\nThe year is ended, and we are now in the midst of the Christmas\r\nholidays, which are kept this year as last, according to the general\r\ndescription previously given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. _The Run-Away Plot_\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YEAR’S THOUGHTS AND MEDITATIONS—AGAIN BOUGHT BY FREELAND—NO\r\nAMBITION TO BE A SLAVE—KINDNESS NO COMPENSATION FOR SLAVERY—INCIPIENT\r\nSTEPS TOWARD ESCAPE—CONSIDERATIONS LEADING THERETO—IRRECONCILABLE\r\nHOSTILITY TO SLAVERY—SOLEMN VOW TAKEN—PLAN DIVULGED TO THE\r\nSLAVES—_Columbian Orator—_SCHEME GAINS FAVOR, DESPITE PRO-SLAVERY\r\nPREACHING—DANGER OF DISCOVERY—SKILL OF SLAVEHOLDERS IN READING THE\r\nMINDS OF THEIR SLAVES—SUSPICION AND COERCION—HYMNS WITH DOUBLE\r\nMEANING—VALUE, IN DOLLARS, OF OUR COMPANY—PRELIMINARY\r\nCONSULTATION—PASS-WORD—CONFLICTS OF HOPE AND FEAR—DIFFICULTIES TO BE\r\nOVERCOME—IGNORANCE OF GEOGRAPHY—SURVEY OF IMAGINARY DIFFICULTIES—EFFECT\r\nON OUR MINDS—PATRICK HENRY—SANDY BECOMES A DREAMER—ROUTE TO THE NORTH\r\nLAID OUT—OBJECTIONS CONSIDERED—FRAUDS PRACTICED ON FREEMEN—PASSES\r\nWRITTEN—ANXIETIES AS THE TIME DREW NEAR—DREAD OF FAILURE—APPEALS TO\r\nCOMRADES—STRANGE PRESENTIMENT—COINCIDENCE—THE BETRAYAL DISCOVERED—THE\r\nMANNER OF ARRESTING US—RESISTANCE MADE BY HENRY HARRIS—ITS EFFECT—THE\r\nUNIQUE SPEECH OF MRS.

The mind naturally occupies itself with the mysteries\r\nof life in all its phases—the ideal, the real and the actual. Sober\r\npeople look both ways at the beginning of the year, surveying the\r\nerrors of the past, and providing against possible errors of the\r\nfuture. I, too, was thus exercised. I had little pleasure in\r\nretrospect, and the prospect was not very brilliant. “Notwithstanding,”\r\nthought I, “the many resolutions and prayers I have made, in behalf of\r\nfreedom, I am, this first day of the year 1836, still a slave, still\r\nwandering in the depths of spirit-devouring thralldom. My faculties and\r\npowers of body and soul are not my own, but are the property of a\r\nfellow mortal, in no sense superior to me, except that he has the\r\nphysical power to compel me to be owned and controlled by him. By the\r\ncombined physical force of the community, I am his slave—a slave for\r\nlife.” With thoughts like these, I was perplexed and chafed; they\r\nrendered me gloomy and disconsolate. The anguish of my mind may not be\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year 1835, Mr. Freeland, my temporary master, had\r\nbought me of Capt. Thomas Auld, for the year 1836. His promptness in\r\nsecuring my services, would have been flattering to my vanity, had I\r\nbeen ambitious to win the reputation of being a valuable slave. Even as\r\nit was, I felt a slight degree of complacency at the circumstance. It\r\nshowed he was as well pleased with me as a slave, as I was with him as\r\na master. I have already intimated my regard for Mr. Freeland, and I\r\nmay say here, in addressing northern readers—where is no selfish motive\r\nfor speaking in praise of a slaveholder—that Mr. Freeland was a man of\r\nmany excellent qualities, and to me quite preferable to any master I\r\never had.\r\n\r\nBut the kindness of the slavemaster only gilds the chain of slavery,\r\nand detracts nothing from its weight or power. The thought that men are\r\nmade for other and better uses than slavery, thrives best under the\r\ngentle treatment of a kind master. But the grim visage of slavery can\r\nassume no smiles which can fascinate the partially enlightened slave,\r\ninto a forgetfulness of his bondage, nor of the desirableness of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nI was not through the first month of this, my second year with the kind\r\nand gentlemanly Mr. Freeland, before I was earnestly considering and\r\nadvising plans for gaining that freedom, which, when I was but a mere\r\nchild, I had ascertained to be the natural and inborn right of every\r\nmember of the human family. The desire for this freedom had been\r\nbenumbed, while I was under the brutalizing dominion of Covey; and it\r\nhad been postponed, and rendered inoperative, by my truly pleasant\r\nSunday school engagements with my friends, during the year 1835, at Mr.\r\nFreeland’s. It had, however, never entirely subsided. I hated slavery,\r\nalways, and the desire for freedom only needed a favorable breeze, to\r\nfan it into a blaze, at any moment. The thought of only being a\r\ncreature of the _present_ and the _past_, troubled me, and I longed to\r\nhave a _future_—a future with hope in it. To be shut up entirely to the\r\npast and present, is abhorrent to the human mind; it is to the\r\nsoul—whose life and happiness is unceasing progress—what the prison is\r\nto the body; a blight and mildew, a hell of horrors. The dawning of\r\nthis, another year, awakened me from my temporary slumber, and roused\r\ninto life my latent, but long cherished aspirations for freedom. I was\r\nnow not only ashamed to be contented in slavery, but ashamed to _seem_\r\nto be contented, and in my present favorable condition, under the mild\r\nrule of Mr. F., I am not sure that some kind reader will not condemn me\r\nfor being over ambitious, and greatly wanting in proper humility, when\r\nI say the truth, that I now drove from me all thoughts of making the\r\nbest of my lot, and welcomed only such thoughts as led me away from the\r\nhouse of bondage. The intense desires, now felt, _to be free_,\r\nquickened by my present favorable circumstances, brought me to the\r\ndetermination to act, as well as to think and speak. Accordingly, at\r\nthe beginning of this year 1836, I took upon me a solemn vow, that the\r\nyear which had now dawned upon me should not close, without witnessing\r\nan earnest attempt, on my part, to gain my liberty. This vow only bound\r\nme to make my escape individually; but the year spent with Mr. Freeland\r\nhad attached me, as with “hooks of steel,” to my brother slaves. The\r\nmost affectionate and confiding friendship existed between us; and I\r\nfelt it my duty to give them an opportunity to share in my virtuous\r\ndetermination by frankly disclosing to them my plans and purposes.\r\nToward Henry and John Harris, I felt a friendship as strong as one man\r\ncan feel for another; for I could have died with and for them. To them,\r\ntherefore, with a suitable degree of caution, I began to disclose my\r\nsentiments and plans; sounding them, the while on the subject of\r\nrunning away, provided a good chance should offer. I scarcely need tell\r\nthe reader, that I did my _very best_ to imbue the minds of my dear\r\nfriends with my own views and feelings. Thoroughly awakened, now, and\r\nwith a definite vow upon me, all my little reading, which had any\r\nbearing on the subject of human rights, was rendered available in my\r\ncommunications with my friends. That (to me) gem of a book, the\r\n_Columbian Orator_, with its eloquent orations and spicy dialogues,\r\ndenouncing oppression and slavery—telling of what had been dared, done\r\nand suffered by men, to obtain the inestimable boon of liberty—was\r\nstill fresh in my memory, and whirled into the ranks of my speech with\r\nthe aptitude of well trained soldiers, going through the drill. The\r\nfact is, I here began my public speaking. I canvassed, with Henry and\r\nJohn, the subject of slavery, and dashed against it the condemning\r\nbrand of God’s eternal justice, which it every hour violates. My fellow\r\nservants were neither indifferent, dull, nor inapt. Our feelings were\r\nmore alike than our opinions. All, however, were ready to act, when a\r\nfeasible plan should be proposed. “Show us _how_ the thing is to be\r\ndone,” said they, “and all is clear.”\r\n\r\nWe were all, except Sandy, quite free from slaveholding priestcraft. It\r\nwas in vain that we had been taught from the pulpit at St. Michael’s,\r\nthe duty of obedience to our masters; to recognize God as the author of\r\nour enslavement; to regard running away an offense, alike against God\r\nand man; to deem our enslavement a merciful and beneficial arrangement;\r\nto esteem our condition, in this country, a paradise to that from which\r\nwe had been snatched in Africa; to consider our hard hands and dark\r\ncolor as God’s mark of displeasure, and as pointing us out as the\r\nproper subjects of slavery; that the relation of master and slave was\r\none of reciprocal benefits; that our work was not more serviceable to\r\nour masters, than our master’s thinking was serviceable to us. I say,\r\nit was in vain that the pulpit of St. Michael’s had constantly\r\ninculcated these plausible doctrine. Nature laughed them to scorn. For\r\nmy own part, I had now become altogether too big for my chains. Father\r\nLawson’s solemn words, of what I ought to be, and might be, in the\r\nprovidence of God, had not fallen dead on my soul. I was fast verging\r\ntoward manhood, and the prophecies of my childhood were still\r\nunfulfilled. The thought, that year after year had passed away, and my\r\nresolutions to run away had failed and faded—that I was _still a\r\nslave_, and a slave, too, with chances for gaining my freedom\r\ndiminished and still diminishing—was not a matter to be slept over\r\neasily; nor did I easily sleep over it.\r\n\r\nBut here came a new trouble. Thoughts and purposes so incendiary as\r\nthose I now cherished, could not agitate the mind long, without danger\r\nof making themselves manifest to scrutinizing and unfriendly beholders.\r\nI had reason to fear that my sable face might prove altogether too\r\ntransparent for the safe concealment of my hazardous enterprise. Plans\r\nof greater moment have leaked through stone walls, and revealed their\r\nprojectors. But, here was no stone wall to hide my purpose. I would\r\nhave given my poor, tell tale face for the immoveable countenance of an\r\nIndian, for it was far from being proof against the daily, searching\r\nglances of those with whom I met.\r\n\r\nIt is the interest and business of slaveholders to study human nature,\r\nwith a view to practical results, and many of them attain astonishing\r\nproficiency in discerning the thoughts and emotions of slaves. They\r\nhave to deal not with earth, wood, or stone, but with _men;_ and, by\r\nevery regard they have for their safety and prosperity, they must study\r\nto know the material on which they are at work. So much intellect as\r\nthe slaveholder has around him, requires watching. Their safety depends\r\nupon their vigilance. Conscious of the injustice and wrong they are\r\nevery hour perpetrating, and knowing what they themselves would do if\r\nmade the victims of such wrongs, they are looking out for the first\r\nsigns of the dread retribution of justice. They watch, therefore, with\r\nskilled and practiced eyes, and have learned to read, with great\r\naccuracy, the state of mind and heart of the slaves, through his sable\r\nface. These uneasy sinners are quick to inquire into the matter, where\r\nthe slave is concerned. Unusual sobriety, apparent abstraction,\r\nsullenness and indifference—indeed, any mood out of the common\r\nway—afford ground for suspicion and inquiry. Often relying on their\r\nsuperior position and wisdom, they hector and torture the slave into a\r\nconfession, by affecting to know the truth of their accusations. “You\r\nhave got the devil in you,” say they, “and we will whip him out of\r\nyou.” I have often been put thus to the torture, on bare suspicion.\r\nThis system has its disadvantages as well as their opposite. The slave\r\nis sometimes whipped into the confession of offenses which he never\r\ncommitted. The reader will see that the good old rule—“a man is to be\r\nheld innocent until proved to be guilty”—does not hold good on the\r\nslave plantation. Suspicion and torture are the approved methods of\r\ngetting at the truth, here. It was necessary for me, therefore, to keep\r\na watch over my deportment, lest the enemy should get the better of me.\r\n\r\nBut with all our caution and studied reserve, I am not sure that Mr.\r\nFreeland did not suspect that all was not right with us. It _did_ seem\r\nthat he watched us more narrowly, after the plan of escape had been\r\nconceived and discussed amongst us. Men seldom see themselves as others\r\nsee them; and while, to ourselves, everything connected with our\r\ncontemplated escape appeared concealed, Mr. Freeland may have, with the\r\npeculiar prescience of a slaveholder, mastered the huge thought which\r\nwas disturbing our peace in slavery.\r\n\r\nI am the more inclined to think that he suspected us, because, prudent\r\nas we were, as I now look back, I can see that we did many silly\r\nthings, very well calculated to awaken suspicion. We were, at times,\r\nremarkably buoyant, singing hymns and making joyous exclamations,\r\nalmost as triumphant in their tone as if we reached a land of freedom\r\nand safety. A keen observer might have detected in our repeated singing\r\nof\r\n\r\n_O Canaan, sweet Canaan,\r\nI am bound for the land of Canaan,_\r\n\r\n\r\nsomething more than a hope of reaching heaven. We meant to reach the\r\n_north_—and the north was our Canaan.\r\n\r\n_I thought I heard them say,\r\nThere were lions in the way,\r\nI don’t expect to Star\r\n          Much longer here._\r\n\r\n_Run to Jesus—shun the danger—\r\nI don’t expect to stay\r\n          Much longer here_.\r\n\r\n\r\nwas a favorite air, and had a double meaning. In the lips of some, it\r\nmeant the expectation of a speedy summons to a world of spirits; but,\r\nin the lips of _our_ company, it simply meant, a speedy pilgrimage\r\ntoward a free state, and deliverance from all the evils and dangers of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nI had succeeded in winning to my (what slaveholders would call wicked)\r\nscheme, a company of five young men, the very flower of the\r\nneighborhood, each one of whom would have commanded one thousand\r\ndollars in the home market. At New Orleans, they would have brought\r\nfifteen hundred dollars a piece, and, perhaps, more. The names of our\r\nparty were as follows: Henry Harris; John Harris, brother to Henry;\r\nSandy Jenkins, of root memory; Charles Roberts, and Henry Bailey. I was\r\nthe youngest, but one, of the party. I had, however, the advantage of\r\nthem all, in experience, and in a knowledge of letters. This gave me\r\ngreat influence over them. Perhaps not one of them, left to himself,\r\nwould have dreamed of escape as a possible thing. Not one of them was\r\nself-moved in the matter. They all wanted to be free; but the serious\r\nthought of running away, had not entered into their minds, until I won\r\nthem to the undertaking. They all were tolerably well off—for\r\nslaves—and had dim hopes of being set free, some day, by their masters.\r\nIf any one is to blame for disturbing the quiet of the slaves and\r\nslave-masters of the neighborhood of St. Michael’s, _I am the man_. I\r\nclaim to be the instigator of the high crime (as the slaveholders\r\nregard it) and I kept life in it, until life could be kept in it no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nPending the time of our contemplated departure out of our Egypt, we met\r\noften by night, and on every Sunday. At these meetings we talked the\r\nmatter over; told our hopes and fears, and the difficulties discovered\r\nor imagined; and, like men of sense, we counted the cost of the\r\nenterprise to which we were committing ourselves.\r\n\r\nThese meetings must have resembled, on a small scale, the meetings of\r\nrevolutionary conspirators, in their primary condition. We were\r\nplotting against our (so called) lawful rulers; with this difference\r\nthat we sought our own good, and not the harm of our enemies. We did\r\nnot seek to overthrow them, but to escape from them. As for Mr.\r\nFreeland, we all liked him, and would have gladly remained with him,\r\n_as freeman_. LIBERTY was our aim; and we had now come to think that we\r\nhad a right to liberty, against every obstacle even against the lives\r\nof our enslavers.\r\n\r\nWe had several words, expressive of things, important to us, which we\r\nunderstood, but which, even if distinctly heard by an outsider, would\r\nconvey no certain meaning. I have reasons for suppressing these\r\n_pass-words_, which the reader will easily divine. I hated the secrecy;\r\nbut where slavery is powerful, and liberty is weak, the latter is\r\ndriven to concealment or to destruction.\r\n\r\nThe prospect was not always a bright one. At times, we were almost\r\ntempted to abandon the enterprise, and to get back to that comparative\r\npeace of mind, which even a man under the gallows might feel, when all\r\nhope of escape had vanished. Quiet bondage was felt to be better than\r\nthe doubts, fears and uncertainties, which now so sadly perplexed and\r\ndisturbed us.\r\n\r\nThe infirmities of humanity, generally, were represented in our little\r\nband. We were confident, bold and determined, at times; and, again,\r\ndoubting, timid and wavering; whistling, like the boy in the graveyard,\r\nto keep away the spirits.\r\n\r\nTo look at the map, and observe the proximity of Eastern Shore,\r\nMaryland, to Delaware and Pennsylvania, it may seem to the reader quite\r\nabsurd, to regard the proposed escape as a formidable undertaking. But\r\nto _understand_, some one has said a man must _stand under_. The real\r\ndistance was great enough, but the imagined distance was, to our\r\nignorance, even greater. Every slaveholder seeks to impress his slave\r\nwith a belief in the boundlessness of slave territory, and of his own\r\nalmost illimitable power. We all had vague and indistinct notions of\r\nthe geography of the country.\r\n\r\nThe distance, however, is not the chief trouble. The nearer are the\r\nlines of a slave state and the borders of a free one, the greater the\r\nperil. Hired kidnappers infest these borders. Then, too, we knew that\r\nmerely reaching a free state did not free us; that, wherever caught, we\r\ncould be returned to slavery. We could see no spot on this side the\r\nocean, where we could be free. We had heard of Canada, the real Canaan\r\nof the American bondmen, simply as a country to which the wild goose\r\nand the swan repaired at the end of winter, to escape the heat of\r\nsummer, but not as the home of man. I knew something of theology, but\r\nnothing of geography. I really did not, at that time, know that there\r\nwas a state of New York, or a state of Massachusetts. I had heard of\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey, and all the southern states, but\r\nwas ignorant of the free states, generally. New York city was our\r\nnorthern limit, and to go there, and be forever harassed with the\r\nliability of being hunted down and returned to slavery—with the\r\ncertainty of being treated ten times worse than we had ever been\r\ntreated before was a prospect far from delightful, and it might well\r\ncause some hesitation about engaging in the enterprise. The case,\r\nsometimes, to our excited visions, stood thus: At every gate through\r\nwhich we had to pass, we saw a watchman; at every ferry, a guard; on\r\nevery bridge, a sentinel; and in every wood, a patrol or slave-hunter.\r\nWe were hemmed in on every side. The good to be sought, and the evil to\r\nbe shunned, were flung in the balance, and weighed against each other.\r\nOn the one hand, there stood slavery; a stern reality, glaring\r\nfrightfully upon us, with the blood of millions in his polluted\r\nskirts—terrible to behold—greedily devouring our hard earnings and\r\nfeeding himself upon our flesh. Here was the evil from which to escape.\r\nOn the other hand, far away, back in the hazy distance, where all forms\r\nseemed but shadows, under the flickering light of the north star—behind\r\nsome craggy hill or snow-covered mountain—stood a doubtful freedom,\r\nhalf frozen, beckoning us to her icy domain. This was the good to be\r\nsought. The inequality was as great as that between certainty and\r\nuncertainty. This, in itself, was enough to stagger us; but when we\r\ncame to survey the untrodden road, and conjecture the many possible\r\ndifficulties, we were appalled, and at times, as I have said, were upon\r\nthe point of giving over the struggle altogether.\r\n\r\nThe reader can have little idea of the phantoms of trouble which flit,\r\nin such circumstances, before the uneducated mind of the slave. Upon\r\neither side, we saw grim death assuming a variety of horrid shapes.\r\nNow, it was starvation, causing us, in a strange and friendless land,\r\nto eat our own flesh. Now, we were contending with the waves (for our\r\njourney was in part by water) and were drowned. Now, we were hunted by\r\ndogs, and overtaken and torn to pieces by their merciless fangs. We\r\nwere stung by scorpions—chased by wild beasts—bitten by snakes; and,\r\nworst of all, after having succeeded in swimming rivers—encountering\r\nwild beasts—sleeping in the woods—suffering hunger, cold, heat and\r\nnakedness—we supposed ourselves to be overtaken by hired kidnappers,\r\nwho, in the name of the law, and for their thrice accursed reward,\r\nwould, perchance, fire upon us—kill some, wound others, and capture\r\nall. This dark picture, drawn by ignorance and fear, at times greatly\r\nshook our determination, and not unfrequently caused us to\r\n\r\nRather bear those ills we had\r\nThan fly to others which we knew not of.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not disposed to magnify this circumstance in my experience, and\r\nyet I think I shall seem to be so disposed, to the reader. No man can\r\ntell the intense agony which is felt by the slave, when wavering on the\r\npoint of making his escape. All that he has is at stake; and even that\r\nwhich he has not, is at stake, also. The life which he has, may be\r\nlost, and the liberty which he seeks, may not be gained.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry, to a listening senate, thrilled by his magic eloquence,\r\nand ready to stand by him in his boldest flights, could say, GIVE ME\r\nLIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH, and this saying was a sublime one, even for a\r\nfreeman; but, incomparably more sublime, is the same sentiment, when\r\n_practically_ asserted by men accustomed to the lash and chain—men\r\nwhose sensibilities must have become more or less deadened by their\r\nbondage. With us it was a _doubtful_ liberty, at best, that we sought;\r\nand a certain, lingering death in the rice swamps and sugar fields, if\r\nwe failed. Life is not lightly regarded by men of sane minds. It is\r\nprecious, alike to the pauper and to the prince—to the slave, and to\r\nhis master; and yet, I believe there was not one among us, who would\r\nnot rather have been shot down, than pass away life in hopeless\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of our preparations, Sandy, the root man, became\r\ntroubled. He began to have dreams, and some of them were very\r\ndistressing. One of these, which happened on a Friday night, was, to\r\nhim, of great significance; and I am quite ready to confess, that I\r\nfelt somewhat damped by it myself. He said, “I dreamed, last night,\r\nthat I was roused from sleep, by strange noises, like the voices of a\r\nswarm of angry birds, that caused a roar as they passed, which fell\r\nupon my ear like a coming gale over the tops of the trees. Looking up\r\nto see what it could mean,” said Sandy, “I saw you, Frederick, in the\r\nclaws of a huge bird, surrounded by a large number of birds, of all\r\ncolors and sizes. These were all picking at you, while you, with your\r\narms, seemed to be trying to protect your eyes. Passing over me, the\r\nbirds flew in a south-westerly direction, and I watched them until they\r\nwere clean out of sight. Now, I saw this as plainly as I now see you;\r\nand furder, honey, watch de Friday night dream; dare is sumpon in it,\r\nshose you born; dare is, indeed, honey.”\r\n\r\nI confess I did not like this dream; but I threw off concern about it,\r\nby attributing it to the general excitement and perturbation consequent\r\nupon our contemplated plan of escape. I could not, however, shake off\r\nits effect at once. I felt that it boded me no good. Sandy was\r\nunusually emphatic and oracular, and his manner had much to do with the\r\nimpression made upon me.\r\n\r\nThe plan of escape which I recommended, and to which my comrades\r\nassented, was to take a large canoe, owned by Mr. Hamilton, and, on the\r\nSaturday night previous to the Easter holidays, launch out into the\r\nChesapeake bay, and paddle for its head—a distance of seventy miles\r\nwith all our might. Our course, on reaching this point, was, to turn\r\nthe canoe adrift, and bend our steps toward the north star, till we\r\nreached a free state.\r\n\r\nThere were several objections to this plan. One was, the danger from\r\ngales on the bay. In rough weather, the waters of the Chesapeake are\r\nmuch agitated, and there is danger, in a canoe, of being swamped by the\r\nwaves. Another objection was, that the canoe would soon be missed; the\r\nabsent persons would, at once, be suspected of having taken it; and we\r\nshould be pursued by some of the fast sailing bay craft out of St.\r\nMichael’s. Then, again, if we reached the head of the bay, and turned\r\nthe canoe adrift, she might prove a guide to our track, and bring the\r\nland hunters after us.\r\n\r\nThese and other objections were set aside, by the stronger ones which\r\ncould be urged against every other plan that could then be suggested.\r\nOn the water, we had a chance of being regarded as fishermen, in the\r\nservice of a master. On the other hand, by taking the land route,\r\nthrough the counties adjoining Delaware, we should be subjected to all\r\nmanner of interruptions, and many very disagreeable questions, which\r\nmight give us serious trouble. Any white man is authorized to stop a\r\nman of color, on any road, and examine him, and arrest him, if he so\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nBy this arrangement, many abuses (considered such even by slaveholders)\r\noccur. Cases have been known, where freemen have been called upon to\r\nshow their free papers, by a pack of ruffians—and, on the presentation\r\nof the papers, the ruffians have torn them up, and seized their victim,\r\nand sold him to a life of endless bondage.\r\n\r\nThe week before our intended start, I wrote a pass for each of our\r\nparty, giving them permission to visit Baltimore, during the Easter\r\nholidays. The pass ran after this manner:\r\n\r\nThis is to certify, that I, the undersigned, have given the bearer, my\r\nservant, John, full liberty to go to Baltimore, to spend the Easter\r\nholidays.\r\n\r\n\r\nW.H.\r\nNear St. Michael’s, Talbot county, Maryland\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we were not going to Baltimore, and were intending to land\r\neast of North Point, in the direction where I had seen the Philadelphia\r\nsteamers go, these passes might be made useful to us in the lower part\r\nof the bay, while steering toward Baltimore. These were not, however,\r\nto be shown by us, until all other answers failed to satisfy the\r\ninquirer. We were all fully alive to the importance of being calm and\r\nself-possessed, when accosted, if accosted we should be; and we more\r\ntimes than one rehearsed to each other how we should behave in the hour\r\nof trial.\r\n\r\nThese were long, tedious days and nights. The suspense was painful, in\r\nthe extreme. To balance probabilities, where life and liberty hang on\r\nthe result, requires steady nerves. I panted for action, and was glad\r\nwhen the day, at the close of which we were to start, dawned upon us.\r\nSleeping, the night before, was out of the question. I probably felt\r\nmore deeply than any of my companions, because I was the instigator of\r\nthe movement. The responsibility of the whole enterprise rested on my\r\nshoulders. The glory of success, and the shame and confusion of\r\nfailure, could not be matters of indifference to me. Our food was\r\nprepared; our clothes were packed up; we were all ready to go, and\r\nimpatient for Saturday morning—considering that the last morning of our\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the tempest and tumult of my brain, that morning. The\r\nreader will please to bear in mind, that, in a slave state, an\r\nunsuccessful runaway is not only subjected to cruel torture, and sold\r\naway to the far south, but he is frequently execrated by the other\r\nslaves. He is charged with making the condition of the other slaves\r\nintolerable, by laying them all under the suspicion of their\r\nmasters—subjecting them to greater vigilance, and imposing greater\r\nlimitations on their privileges. I dreaded murmurs from this quarter.\r\nIt is difficult, too, for a slavemaster to believe that slaves escaping\r\nhave not been aided in their flight by some one of their fellow slaves.\r\nWhen, therefore, a slave is missing, every slave on the place is\r\nclosely examined as to his knowledge of the undertaking; and they are\r\nsometimes even tortured, to make them disclose what they are suspected\r\nof knowing of such escape.\r\n\r\nOur anxiety grew more and more intense, as the time of our intended\r\ndeparture for the north drew nigh. It was truly felt to be a matter of\r\nlife and death with us; and we fully intended to _fight_ as well as\r\n_run_, if necessity should occur for that extremity. But the trial hour\r\nwas not yet to come. It was easy to resolve, but not so easy to act. I\r\nexpected there might be some drawing back, at the last. It was natural\r\nthat there should be; therefore, during the intervening time, I lost no\r\nopportunity to explain away difficulties, to remove doubts, to dispel\r\nfears, and to inspire all with firmness. It was too late to look back;\r\nand _now_ was the time to go forward. Like most other men, we had done\r\nthe talking part of our work, long and well; and the time had come to\r\n_act_ as if we were in earnest, and meant to be as true in action as in\r\nwords. I did not forget to appeal to the pride of my comrades, by\r\ntelling them that, if after having solemnly promised to go, as they had\r\ndone, they now failed to make the attempt, they would, in effect, brand\r\nthemselves with cowardice, and might as well sit down, fold their arms,\r\nand acknowledge themselves as fit only to be _slaves_. This detestable\r\ncharacter, all were unwilling to assume. Every man except Sandy (he,\r\nmuch to our regret, withdrew) stood firm; and at our last meeting we\r\npledged ourselves afresh, and in the most solemn manner, that, at the\r\ntime appointed, we _would_ certainly start on our long journey for a\r\nfree country. This meeting was in the middle of the week, at the end of\r\nwhich we were to start.\r\n\r\nEarly that morning we went, as usual, to the field, but with hearts\r\nthat beat quickly and anxiously. Any one intimately acquainted with us,\r\nmight have seen that all was not well with us, and that some monster\r\nlingered in our thoughts. Our work that morning was the same as it had\r\nbeen for several days past—drawing out and spreading manure. While thus\r\nengaged, I had a sudden presentiment, which flashed upon me like\r\nlightning in a dark night, revealing to the lonely traveler the gulf\r\nbefore, and the enemy behind. I instantly turned to Sandy Jenkins, who\r\nwas near me, and said to him, _“Sandy, we are betrayed;_ something has\r\njust told me so.” I felt as sure of it, as if the officers were there\r\nin sight. Sandy said, “Man, dat is strange; but I feel just as you do.”\r\nIf my mother—then long in her grave—had appeared before me, and told me\r\nthat we were betrayed, I could not, at that moment, have felt more\r\ncertain of the fact.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes after this, the long, low and distant notes of the\r\nhorn summoned us from the field to breakfast. I felt as one may be\r\nsupposed to feel before being led forth to be executed for some great\r\noffense. I wanted no breakfast; but I went with the other slaves toward\r\nthe house, for form’s sake. My feelings were not disturbed as to the\r\nright of running away; on that point I had no trouble, whatever. My\r\nanxiety arose from a sense of the consequences of failure.\r\n\r\nIn thirty minutes after that vivid presentiment came the apprehended\r\ncrash. On reaching the house, for breakfast, and glancing my eye toward\r\nthe lane gate, the worst was at once made known. The lane gate off Mr.\r\nFreeland’s house, is nearly a half mile from the door, and shaded by\r\nthe heavy wood which bordered the main road. I was, however, able to\r\ndescry four white men, and two colored men, approaching. The white men\r\nwere on horseback, and the colored men were walking behind, and seemed\r\nto be tied. _“It is all over with us,”_ thought I, _“we are surely\r\nbetrayed_.” I now became composed, or at least comparatively so, and\r\ncalmly awaited the result. I watched the ill-omened company, till I saw\r\nthem enter the gate. Successful flight was impossible, and I made up my\r\nmind to stand, and meet the evil, whatever it might be; for I was not\r\nwithout a slight hope that things might turn differently from what I at\r\nfirst expected. In a few moments, in came Mr. William Hamilton, riding\r\nvery rapidly, and evidently much excited. He was in the habit of riding\r\nvery slowly, and was seldom known to gallop his horse. This time, his\r\nhorse was nearly at full speed, causing the dust to roll thick behind\r\nhim. Mr. Hamilton, though one of the most resolute men in the whole\r\nneighborhood, was, nevertheless, a remarkably mild spoken man; and,\r\neven when greatly excited, his language was cool and circumspect. He\r\ncame to the door, and inquired if Mr. Freeland was in. I told him that\r\nMr. Freeland was at the barn. Off the old gentleman rode, toward the\r\nbarn, with unwonted speed. Mary, the cook, was at a loss to know what\r\nwas the matter, and I did not profess any skill in making her\r\nunderstand. I knew she would have united, as readily as any one, in\r\ncursing me for bringing trouble into the family; so I held my peace,\r\nleaving matters to develop themselves, without my assistance. In a few\r\nmoments, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Freeland came down from the barn to the\r\nhouse; and, just as they made their appearance in the front yard, three\r\nmen (who proved to be constables) came dashing into the lane, on\r\nhorseback, as if summoned by a sign requiring quick work. A few seconds\r\nbrought them into the front yard, where they hastily dismounted, and\r\ntied their horses. This done, they joined Mr. Freeland and Mr.\r\nHamilton, who were standing a short distance from the kitchen. A few\r\nmoments were spent, as if in consulting how to proceed, and then the\r\nwhole party walked up to the kitchen door. There was now no one in the\r\nkitchen but myself and John Harris. Henry and Sandy were yet at the\r\nbarn. Mr. Freeland came inside the kitchen door, and with an agitated\r\nvoice, called me by name, and told me to come forward; that there was\r\nsome gentlemen who wished to see me. I stepped toward them, at the\r\ndoor, and asked what they wanted, when the constables grabbed me, and\r\ntold me that I had better not resist; that I had been in a scrape, or\r\nwas said to have been in one; that they were merely going to take me\r\nwhere I could be examined; that they were going to carry me to St.\r\nMichael’s, to have me brought before my master. They further said,\r\nthat, in case the evidence against me was not true, I should be\r\nacquitted. I was now firmly tied, and completely at the mercy of my\r\ncaptors. Resistance was idle. They were five in number, armed to the\r\nvery teeth. When they had secured me, they next turned to John Harris,\r\nand, in a few moments, succeeded in tying him as firmly as they had\r\nalready tied me. They next turned toward Henry Harris, who had now\r\nreturned from the barn. “Cross your hands,” said the constables, to\r\nHenry. “I won’t” said Henry, in a voice so firm and clear, and in a\r\nmanner so determined, as for a moment to arrest all proceedings. “Won’t\r\nyou cross your hands?” said Tom Graham, the constable. “_No I won’t_,”\r\nsaid Henry, with increasing emphasis. Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Freeland, and\r\nthe officers, now came near to Henry. Two of the constables drew out\r\ntheir shining pistols, and swore by the name of God, that he should\r\ncross his hands, or they would shoot him down. Each of these hired\r\nruffians now cocked their pistols, and, with fingers apparently on the\r\ntriggers, presented their deadly weapons to the breast of the unarmed\r\nslave, saying, at the same time, if he did not cross his hands, they\r\nwould “blow his d—d heart out of him.”\r\n\r\n_“Shoot! shoot me!”_ said Henry. “_You can’t kill me but once_.\r\nShoot!—shoot! and be d—d. _I won’t be tied_.” This, the brave fellow\r\nsaid in a voice as defiant and heroic in its tone, as was the language\r\nitself; and, at the moment of saying this, with the pistols at his very\r\nbreast, he quickly raised his arms, and dashed them from the puny hands\r\nof his assassins, the weapons flying in opposite directions. Now came\r\nthe struggle. All hands was now rushed upon the brave fellow, and,\r\nafter beating him for some time, they succeeded in overpowering and\r\ntying him. Henry put me to shame; he fought, and fought bravely. John\r\nand I had made no resistance. The fact is, I never see much use in\r\nfighting, unless there is a reasonable probability of whipping\r\nsomebody. Yet there was something almost providential in the resistance\r\nmade by the gallant Henry. But for that resistance, every soul of us\r\nwould have been hurried off to the far south. Just a moment previous to\r\nthe trouble with Henry, Mr. Hamilton _mildly_ said—and this gave me the\r\nunmistakable clue to the cause of our arrest—“Perhaps we had now better\r\nmake a search for those protections, which we understand Frederick has\r\nwritten for himself and the rest.” Had these passes been found, they\r\nwould have been point blank proof against us, and would have confirmed\r\nall the statements of our betrayer. Thanks to the resistance of Henry,\r\nthe excitement produced by the scuffle drew all attention in that\r\ndirection, and I succeeded in flinging my pass, unobserved, into the\r\nfire. The confusion attendant upon the scuffle, and the apprehension of\r\nfurther trouble, perhaps, led our captors to forego, for the present,\r\nany search for _“those protections” which Frederick was said to have\r\nwritten for his companions_; so we were not yet convicted of the\r\npurpose to run away; and it was evident that there was some doubt, on\r\nthe part of all, whether we had been guilty of such a purpose.\r\n\r\nJust as we were all completely tied, and about ready to start toward\r\nSt. Michael’s, and thence to jail, Mrs. Betsey Freeland (mother to\r\nWilliam, who was very much attached—after the southern fashion—to Henry\r\nand John, they having been reared from childhood in her house) came to\r\nthe kitchen door, with her hands full of biscuits—for we had not had\r\ntime to take our breakfast that morning—and divided them between Henry\r\nand John. This done, the lady made the following parting address to me,\r\nlooking and pointing her bony finger at me. “You devil! you yellow\r\ndevil! It was you that put it into the heads of Henry and John to run\r\naway. But for _you_, you _long legged yellow devil_, Henry and John\r\nwould never have thought of running away.” I gave the lady a look,\r\nwhich called forth a scream of mingled wrath and terror, as she slammed\r\nthe kitchen door, and went in, leaving me, with the rest, in hands as\r\nharsh as her own broken voice.\r\n\r\nCould the kind reader have been quietly riding along the main road to\r\nor from Easton, that morning, his eye would have met a painful sight.\r\nHe would have seen five young men, guilty of no crime, save that of\r\npreferring _liberty_ to a life of _bondage_, drawn along the public\r\nhighway—firmly bound together—tramping through dust and heat,\r\nbare-footed and bare-headed—fastened to three strong horses, whose\r\nriders were armed to the teeth, with pistols and daggers—on their way\r\nto prison, like felons, and suffering every possible insult from the\r\ncrowds of idle, vulgar people, who clustered around, and heartlessly\r\nmade their failure the occasion for all manner of ribaldry and sport.\r\nAs I looked upon this crowd of vile persons, and saw myself and friends\r\nthus assailed and persecuted, I could not help seeing the fulfillment\r\nof Sandy’s dream. I was in the hands of moral vultures, and firmly held\r\nin their sharp talons, and was hurried away toward Easton, in a\r\nsouth-easterly direction, amid the jeers of new birds of the same\r\nfeather, through every neighborhood we passed. It seemed to me (and\r\nthis shows the good understanding between the slaveholders and their\r\nallies) that every body we met knew the cause of our arrest, and were\r\nout, awaiting our passing by, to feast their vindictive eyes on our\r\nmisery and to gloat over our ruin. Some said, _I ought to be hanged_,\r\nand others, _I ought to be burnt_, others, I ought to have the _“hide”_\r\ntaken from my back; while no one gave us a kind word or sympathizing\r\nlook, except the poor slaves, who were lifting their heavy hoes, and\r\nwho cautiously glanced at us through the post-and-rail fences, behind\r\nwhich they were at work. Our sufferings, that morning, can be more\r\neasily imagined than described. Our hopes were all blasted, at a blow.\r\nThe cruel injustice, the victorious crime, and the helplessness of\r\ninnocence, led me to ask, in my ignorance and weakness “Where now is\r\nthe God of justice and mercy? And why have these wicked men the power\r\nthus to trample upon our rights, and to insult our feelings?” And yet,\r\nin the next moment, came the consoling thought, _“The day of oppressor\r\nwill come at last.”_ Of one thing I could be glad—not one of my dear\r\nfriends, upon whom I had brought this great calamity, either by word or\r\nlook, reproached me for having led them into it. We were a band of\r\nbrothers, and never dearer to each other than now. The thought which\r\ngave us the most pain, was the probable separation which would now take\r\nplace, in case we were sold off to the far south, as we were likely to\r\nbe. While the constables were looking forward, Henry and I, being\r\nfastened together, could occasionally exchange a word, without being\r\nobserved by the kidnappers who had us in charge. “What shall I do with\r\nmy pass?” said Henry. “Eat it with your biscuit,” said I; “it won’t do\r\nto tear it up.” We were now near St. Michael’s. The direction\r\nconcerning the passes was passed around, and executed. _“Own nothing!”_\r\nsaid I. _“Own nothing!”_ was passed around and enjoined, and assented\r\nto. Our confidence in each other was unshaken; and we were quite\r\nresolved to succeed or fail together—as much after the calamity which\r\nhad befallen us, as before.\r\n\r\nOn reaching St. Michael’s, we underwent a sort of examination at my\r\nmaster’s store, and it was evident to my mind, that Master Thomas\r\nsuspected the truthfulness of the evidence upon which they had acted in\r\narresting us; and that he only affected, to some extent, the\r\npositiveness with which he asserted our guilt. There was nothing said\r\nby any of our company, which could, in any manner, prejudice our cause;\r\nand there was hope, yet, that we should be able to return to our\r\nhomes—if for nothing else, at least to find out the guilty man or woman\r\nwho had betrayed us.\r\n\r\nTo this end, we all denied that we had been guilty of intended flight.\r\nMaster Thomas said that the evidence he had of our intention to run\r\naway, was strong enough to hang us, in a case of murder. “But,” said I,\r\n“the cases are not equal. If murder were committed, some one must have\r\ncommitted it—the thing is done! In our case, nothing has been done! We\r\nhave not run away. Where is the evidence against us? We were quietly at\r\nour work.” I talked thus, with unusual freedom, to bring out the\r\nevidence against us, for we all wanted, above all things, to know the\r\nguilty wretch who had betrayed us, that we might have something\r\ntangible upon which to pour the execrations. From something which\r\ndropped, in the course of the talk, it appeared that there was but one\r\nwitness against us—and that that witness could not be produced. Master\r\nThomas would not tell us _who_ his informant was; but we suspected, and\r\nsuspected _one_ person _only_. Several circumstances seemed to point\r\nSANDY out, as our betrayer. His entire knowledge of our plans his\r\nparticipation in them—his withdrawal from us—his dream, and his\r\nsimultaneous presentiment that we were betrayed—the taking us, and the\r\nleaving him—were calculated to turn suspicion toward him; and yet, we\r\ncould not suspect him. We all loved him too well to think it _possible_\r\nthat he could have betrayed us. So we rolled the guilt on other\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nWe were literally dragged, that morning, behind horses, a distance of\r\nfifteen miles, and placed in the Easton jail. We were glad to reach the\r\nend of our journey, for our pathway had been the scene of insult and\r\nmortification. Such is the power of public opinion, that it is hard,\r\neven for the innocent, to feel the happy consolations of innocence,\r\nwhen they fall under the maledictions of this power. How could we\r\nregard ourselves as in the right, when all about us denounced us as\r\ncriminals, and had the power and the disposition to treat us as such.\r\n\r\nIn jail, we were placed under the care of Mr. Joseph Graham, the\r\nsheriff of the county. Henry, and John, and myself, were placed in one\r\nroom, and Henry Baily and Charles Roberts, in another, by themselves.\r\nThis separation was intended to deprive us of the advantage of concert,\r\nand to prevent trouble in jail.\r\n\r\nOnce shut up, a new set of tormentors came upon us. A swarm of imps, in\r\nhuman shape the slave-traders, deputy slave-traders, and agents of\r\nslave-traders—that gather in every country town of the state, watching\r\nfor chances to buy human flesh (as buzzards to eat carrion) flocked in\r\nupon us, to ascertain if our masters had placed us in jail to be sold.\r\nSuch a set of debased and villainous creatures, I never saw before, and\r\nhope never to see again. I felt myself surrounded as by a pack of\r\n_fiends_, fresh from _perdition_. They laughed, leered, and grinned at\r\nus; saying, “Ah! boys, we’ve got you, havn’t we? So you were about to\r\nmake your escape? Where were you going to?” After taunting us, and\r\npeering at us, as long as they liked, they one by one subjected us to\r\nan examination, with a view to ascertain our value; feeling our arms\r\nand legs, and shaking us by the shoulders to see if we were sound and\r\nhealthy; impudently asking us, “how we would like to have them for\r\nmasters?” To such questions, we were, very much to their annoyance,\r\nquite dumb, disdaining to answer them. For one, I detested the\r\nwhisky-bloated gamblers in human flesh; and I believe I was as much\r\ndetested by them in turn. One fellow told me, “if he had me, he would\r\ncut the devil out of me pretty quick.”\r\n\r\nThese Negro buyers are very offensive to the genteel southern Christian\r\npublic. They are looked upon, in respectable Maryland society, as\r\nnecessary, but detestable characters. As a class, they are hardened\r\nruffians, made such by nature and by occupation. Their ears are made\r\nquite familiar with the agonizing cry of outraged and woe-smitted\r\nhumanity. Their eyes are forever open to human misery. They walk amid\r\ndesecrated affections, insulted virtue, and blasted hopes. They have\r\ngrown intimate with vice and blood; they gloat over the wildest\r\nillustrations of their soul-damning and earth-polluting business, and\r\nare moral pests. Yes; they are a legitimate fruit of slavery; and it is\r\na puzzle to make out a case of greater villainy for them, than for the\r\nslaveholders, who make such a class _possible_. They are mere hucksters\r\nof the surplus slave produce of Maryland and Virginia coarse, cruel,\r\nand swaggering bullies, whose very breathing is of blasphemy and blood.\r\n\r\nAside from these slave-buyers, who infested the prison, from time to\r\ntime, our quarters were much more comfortable than we had any right to\r\nexpect they would be. Our allowance of food was small and coarse, but\r\nour room was the best in the jail—neat and spacious, and with nothing\r\nabout it necessarily reminding us of being in prison, but its heavy\r\nlocks and bolts and the black, iron lattice-work at the windows. We\r\nwere prisoners of state, compared with most slaves who are put into\r\nthat Easton jail. But the place was not one of contentment. Bolts, bars\r\nand grated windows are not acceptable to freedom-loving people of any\r\ncolor. The suspense, too, was painful. Every step on the stairway was\r\nlistened to, in the hope that the comer would cast a ray of light on\r\nour fate. We would have given the hair off our heads for half a dozen\r\nwords with one of the waiters in Sol. Lowe’s hotel. Such waiters were\r\nin the way of hearing, at the table, the probable course of things. We\r\ncould see them flitting about in their white jackets in front of this\r\nhotel, but could speak to none of them.\r\n\r\nSoon after the holidays were over, contrary to all our expectations,\r\nMessrs. Hamilton and Freeland came up to Easton; not to make a bargain\r\nwith the “Georgia traders,” nor to send us up to Austin Woldfolk, as is\r\nusual in the case of run-away slaves, but to release Charles, Henry\r\nHarris, Henry Baily and John Harris, from prison, and this, too,\r\nwithout the infliction of a single blow. I was now left entirely alone\r\nin prison. The innocent had been taken, and the guilty left. My friends\r\nwere separated from me, and apparently forever. This circumstance\r\ncaused me more pain than any other incident connected with our capture\r\nand imprisonment. Thirty-nine lashes on my naked and bleeding back,\r\nwould have been joyfully borne, in preference to this separation from\r\nthese, the friends of my youth. And yet, I could not but feel that I\r\nwas the victim of something like justice. Why should these young men,\r\nwho were led into this scheme by me, suffer as much as the instigator?\r\nI felt glad that they were leased from prison, and from the dread\r\nprospect of a life (or death I should rather say) in the rice swamps.\r\nIt is due to the noble Henry, to say, that he seemed almost as\r\nreluctant to leave the prison with me in it, as he was to be tied and\r\ndragged to prison. But he and the rest knew that we should, in all the\r\nlikelihoods of the case, be separated, in the event of being sold; and\r\nsince we were now completely in the hands of our owners, we all\r\nconcluded it would be best to go peaceably home.\r\n\r\nNot until this last separation, dear reader, had I touched those\r\nprofounder depths of desolation, which it is the lot of slaves often to\r\nreach. I was solitary in the world, and alone within the walls of a\r\nstone prison, left to a fate of life-long misery. I had hoped and\r\nexpected much, for months before, but my hopes and expectations were\r\nnow withered and blasted. The ever dreaded slave life in Georgia,\r\nLouisiana and Alabama—from which escape is next to impossible now, in\r\nmy loneliness, stared me in the face. The possibility of ever becoming\r\nanything but an abject slave, a mere machine in the hands of an owner,\r\nhad now fled, and it seemed to me it had fled forever. A life of living\r\ndeath, beset with the innumerable horrors of the cotton field, and the\r\nsugar plantation, seemed to be my doom. The fiends, who rushed into the\r\nprison when we were first put there, continued to visit me, and to ply\r\nme with questions and with their tantalizing remarks. I was insulted,\r\nbut helpless; keenly alive to the demands of justice and liberty, but\r\nwith no means of asserting them. To talk to those imps about justice\r\nand mercy, would have been as absurd as to reason with bears and\r\ntigers. Lead and steel are the only arguments that they understand.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining in this life of misery and despair about a week, which,\r\nby the way, seemed a month, Master Thomas, very much to my surprise,\r\nand greatly to my relief, came to the prison, and took me out, for the\r\npurpose, as he said, of sending me to Alabama, with a friend of his,\r\nwho would emancipate me at the end of eight years. I was glad enough to\r\nget out of prison; but I had no faith in the story that this friend of\r\nCapt. Auld would emancipate me, at the end of the time indicated.\r\nBesides, I never had heard of his having a friend in Alabama, and I\r\ntook the announcement, simply as an easy and comfortable method of\r\nshipping me off to the far south. There was a little scandal, too,\r\nconnected with the idea of one Christian selling another to the Georgia\r\ntraders, while it was deemed every way proper for them to sell to\r\nothers. I thought this friend in Alabama was an invention, to meet this\r\ndifficulty, for Master Thomas was quite jealous of his Christian\r\nreputation, however unconcerned he might be about his real Christian\r\ncharacter. In these remarks, however, it is possible that I do Master\r\nThomas Auld injustice. He certainly did not exhaust his power upon me,\r\nin the case, but acted, upon the whole, very generously, considering\r\nthe nature of my offense. He had the power and the provocation to send\r\nme, without reserve, into the very everglades of Florida, beyond the\r\nremotest hope of emancipation; and his refusal to exercise that power,\r\nmust be set down to his credit.\r\n\r\nAfter lingering about St. Michael’s a few days, and no friend from\r\nAlabama making his appearance, to take me there, Master Thomas decided\r\nto send me back again to Baltimore, to live with his brother Hugh, with\r\nwhom he was now at peace; possibly he became so by his profession of\r\nreligion, at the camp-meeting in the Bay Side. Master Thomas told me\r\nthat he wished me to go to Baltimore, and learn a trade; and that, if I\r\nbehaved myself properly, he would _emancipate me at twenty-five!_\r\nThanks for this one beam of hope in the future. The promise had but one\r\nfault; it seemed too good to be true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. _Apprenticeship Life_\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTHING LOST BY THE ATTEMPT TO RUN AWAY—COMRADES IN THEIR OLD\r\nHOMES—REASONS FOR SENDING ME AWAY—RETURN TO BALTIMORE—CONTRAST BETWEEN\r\nTOMMY AND THAT OF HIS COLORED COMPANION—TRIALS IN GARDINER’S SHIP\r\nYARD—DESPERATE FIGHT—ITS CAUSES—CONFLICT BETWEEN WHITE AND BLACK\r\nLABOR—DESCRIPTION OF THE OUTRAGE—COLORED TESTIMONY NOTHING—CONDUCT OF\r\nMASTER HUGH—SPIRIT OF SLAVERY IN BALTIMORE—MY CONDITION IMPROVES—NEW\r\nASSOCIATIONS—SLAVEHOLDER’S RIGHT TO TAKE HIS WAGES—HOW TO MAKE A\r\nCONTENTED SLAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell! dear reader, I am not, as you may have already inferred, a loser\r\nby the general upstir, described in the foregoing chapter. The little\r\ndomestic revolution, notwithstanding the sudden snub it got by the\r\ntreachery of somebody—I dare not say or think who—did not, after all,\r\nend so disastrously, as when in the iron cage at Easton, I conceived it\r\nwould. The prospect, from that point, did look about as dark as any\r\nthat ever cast its gloom over the vision of the anxious, out-looking,\r\nhuman spirit. “All is well that ends well.” My affectionate comrades,\r\nHenry and John Harris, are still with Mr. William Freeland. Charles\r\nRoberts and Henry Baily are safe at their homes. I have not, therefore,\r\nany thing to regret on their account. Their masters have mercifully\r\nforgiven them, probably on the ground suggested in the spirited little\r\nspeech of Mrs. Freeland, made to me just before leaving for the\r\njail—namely: that they had been allured into the wicked scheme of\r\nmaking their escape, by me; and that, but for me, they would never have\r\ndreamed of a thing so shocking! My friends had nothing to regret,\r\neither; for while they were watched more closely on account of what had\r\nhappened, they were, doubtless, treated more kindly than before, and\r\ngot new assurances that they would be legally emancipated, some day,\r\nprovided their behavior should make them deserving, from that time\r\nforward. Not a blow, as I learned, was struck any one of them. As for\r\nMaster William Freeland, good, unsuspecting soul, he did not believe\r\nthat we were intending to run away at all. Having given—as he\r\nthought—no occasion to his boys to leave him, he could not think it\r\nprobable that they had entertained a design so grievous. This, however,\r\nwas not the view taken of the matter by “Mas’ Billy,” as we used to\r\ncall the soft spoken, but crafty and resolute Mr. William Hamilton. He\r\nhad no doubt that the crime had been meditated; and regarding me as the\r\ninstigator of it, he frankly told Master Thomas that he must remove me\r\nfrom that neighborhood, or he would shoot me down. He would not have\r\none so dangerous as “Frederick” tampering with his slaves. William\r\nHamilton was not a man whose threat might be safely disregarded. I have\r\nno doubt that he would have proved as good as his word, had the warning\r\ngiven not been promptly taken. He was furious at the thought of such a\r\npiece of high-handed _theft_, as we were about to perpetrate the\r\nstealing of our own bodies and souls! The feasibility of the plan, too,\r\ncould the first steps have been taken, was marvelously plain. Besides,\r\nthis was a _new_ idea, this use of the bay. Slaves escaping, until now,\r\nhad taken to the woods; they had never dreamed of profaning and abusing\r\nthe waters of the noble Chesapeake, by making them the highway from\r\nslavery to freedom. Here was a broad road of destruction to slavery,\r\nwhich, before, had been looked upon as a wall of security by\r\nslaveholders. But Master Billy could not get Mr. Freeland to see\r\nmatters precisely as he did; nor could he get Master Thomas so excited\r\nas he was himself. The latter—I must say it to his credit—showed much\r\nhumane feeling in his part of the transaction, and atoned for much that\r\nhad been harsh, cruel and unreasonable in his former treatment of me\r\nand others. His clemency was quite unusual and unlooked for. “Cousin\r\nTom” told me that while I was in jail, Master Thomas was very unhappy;\r\nand that the night before his going up to release me, he had walked the\r\nfloor nearly all night, evincing great distress; that very tempting\r\noffers had been made to him, by the Negro-traders, but he had rejected\r\nthem all, saying that _money could not tempt him to sell me to the far\r\nsouth_. All this I can easily believe, for he seemed quite reluctant to\r\nsend me away, at all. He told me that he only consented to do so,\r\nbecause of the very strong prejudice against me in the neighborhood,\r\nand that he feared for my safety if I remained there.\r\n\r\nThus, after three years spent in the country, roughing it in the field,\r\nand experiencing all sorts of hardships, I was again permitted to\r\nreturn to Baltimore, the very place, of all others, short of a free\r\nstate, where I most desired to live. The three years spent in the\r\ncountry, had made some difference in me, and in the household of Master\r\nHugh. “Little Tommy” was no longer _little_ Tommy; and I was not the\r\nslender lad who had left for the Eastern Shore just three years before.\r\nThe loving relations between me and Mas’ Tommy were broken up. He was\r\nno longer dependent on me for protection, but felt himself a _man_,\r\nwith other and more suitable associates. In childhood, he scarcely\r\nconsidered me inferior to himself certainly, as good as any other boy\r\nwith whom he played; but the time had come when his _friend_ must\r\nbecome his _slave_. So we were cold, and we parted. It was a sad thing\r\nto me, that, loving each other as we had done, we must now take\r\ndifferent roads. To him, a thousand avenues were open. Education had\r\nmade him acquainted with all the treasures of the world, and liberty\r\nhad flung open the gates thereunto; but I, who had attended him seven\r\nyears, and had watched over him with the care of a big brother,\r\nfighting his battles in the street, and shielding him from harm, to an\r\nextent which had induced his mother to say, “Oh! Tommy is always safe,\r\nwhen he is with Freddy,” must be confined to a single condition. He\r\ncould grow, and become a MAN; I could grow, though I could _not_ become\r\na man, but must remain, all my life, a minor—a mere boy. Thomas Auld,\r\nJunior, obtained a situation on board the brig “Tweed,” and went to\r\nsea. I know not what has become of him; he certainly has my good wishes\r\nfor his welfare and prosperity. There were few persons to whom I was\r\nmore sincerely attached than to him, and there are few in the world I\r\nwould be more pleased to meet.\r\n\r\nVery soon after I went to Baltimore to live, Master Hugh succeeded in\r\ngetting me hired to Mr. William Gardiner, an extensive ship builder on\r\nFell’s Point. I was placed here to learn to calk, a trade of which I\r\nalready had some knowledge, gained while in Mr. Hugh Auld’s ship-yard,\r\nwhen he was a master builder. Gardiner’s, however, proved a very\r\nunfavorable place for the accomplishment of that object. Mr. Gardiner\r\nwas, that season, engaged in building two large man-of-war vessels,\r\nprofessedly for the Mexican government. These vessels were to be\r\nlaunched in the month of July, of that year, and, in failure thereof,\r\nMr. G. would forfeit a very considerable sum of money. So, when I\r\nentered the ship-yard, all was hurry and driving. There were in the\r\nyard about one hundred men; of these about seventy or eighty were\r\nregular carpenters—privileged men. Speaking of my condition here I\r\nwrote, years ago—and I have now no reason to vary the picture as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThere was no time to learn any thing. Every man had to do that which he\r\nknew how to do. In entering the ship-yard, my orders from Mr. Gardiner\r\nwere, to do whatever the carpenters commanded me to do. This was\r\nplacing me at the beck and call of about seventy-five men. I was to\r\nregard all these as masters. Their word was to be my law. My situation\r\nwas a most trying one. At times I needed a dozen pair of hands. I was\r\ncalled a dozen ways in the space of a single minute. Three or four\r\nvoices would strike my ear at the same moment. It was—“Fred., come help\r\nme to cant this timber here.” “Fred., come carry this timber\r\nyonder.”—“Fred., bring that roller here.”—“Fred., go get a fresh can of\r\nwater.”—“Fred., come help saw off the end of this timber.”—“Fred., go\r\nquick and get the crow bar.”—“Fred., hold on the end of this\r\nfall.”—“Fred., go to the blacksmith’s shop, and get a new punch.”—\r\n\r\n“Hurra, Fred.! run and bring me a cold chisel.”—“I say, Fred., bear a\r\nhand, and get up a fire as quick as lightning under that\r\nsteam-box.”—“Halloo, nigger! come, turn this grindstone.”—“Come, come!\r\nmove, move! and _bowse_ this timber forward.”—“I say, darkey, blast\r\nyour eyes, why don’t you heat up some pitch?”—“Halloo! halloo! halloo!”\r\n(Three voices at the same time.) “Come here!—Go there!—Hold on where\r\nyou are! D—n you, if you move, I’ll knock your brains out!”\r\n\r\nSuch, dear reader, is a glance at the school which was mine, during,\r\nthe first eight months of my stay at Baltimore. At the end of the eight\r\nmonths, Master Hugh refused longer to allow me to remain with Mr.\r\nGardiner. The circumstance which led to his taking me away, was a\r\nbrutal outrage, committed upon me by the white apprentices of the\r\nship-yard. The fight was a desperate one, and I came out of it most\r\nshockingly mangled. I was cut and bruised in sundry places, and my left\r\neye was nearly knocked out of its socket. The facts, leading to this\r\nbarbarous outrage upon me, illustrate a phase of slavery destined to\r\nbecome an important element in the overthrow of the slave system, and I\r\nmay, therefore state them with some minuteness. That phase is this:\r\n_the conflict of slavery with the interests of the white mechanics and\r\nlaborers of the south_. In the country, this conflict is not so\r\napparent; but, in cities, such as Baltimore, Richmond, New Orleans,\r\nMobile, &c., it is seen pretty clearly. The slaveholders, with a\r\ncraftiness peculiar to themselves, by encouraging the enmity of the\r\npoor, laboring white man against the blacks, succeeds in making the\r\nsaid white man almost as much a slave as the black slave himself. The\r\ndifference between the white slave, and the black slave, is this: the\r\nlatter belongs to _one_ slaveholder, and the former belongs to _all_\r\nthe slaveholders, collectively. The white slave has taken from him, by\r\nindirection, what the black slave has taken from him, directly, and\r\nwithout ceremony. Both are plundered, and by the same plunderers. The\r\nslave is robbed, by his master, of all his earnings, above what is\r\nrequired for his bare physical necessities; and the white man is robbed\r\nby the slave system, of the just results of his labor, because he is\r\nflung into competition with a class of laborers who work without wages.\r\nThe competition, and its injurious consequences, will, one day, array\r\nthe nonslaveholding white people of the slave states, against the slave\r\nsystem, and make them the most effective workers against the great\r\nevil. At present, the slaveholders blind them to this competition, by\r\nkeeping alive their prejudice against the slaves, _as men_—not against\r\nthem _as slaves_. They appeal to their pride, often denouncing\r\nemancipation, as tending to place the white man, on an equality with\r\nNegroes, and, by this means, they succeed in drawing off the minds of\r\nthe poor whites from the real fact, that, by the rich slave-master,\r\nthey are already regarded as but a single remove from equality with the\r\nslave. The impression is cunningly made, that slavery is the only power\r\nthat can prevent the laboring white man from falling to the level of\r\nthe slave’s poverty and degradation. To make this enmity deep and\r\nbroad, between the slave and the poor white man, the latter is allowed\r\nto abuse and whip the former, without hinderance. But—as I have\r\nsuggested—this state of facts prevails _mostly_ in the country. In the\r\ncity of Baltimore, there are not unfrequent murmurs, that educating the\r\nslaves to be mechanics may, in the end, give slavemasters power to\r\ndispense with the services of the poor white man altogether. But, with\r\ncharacteristic dread of offending the slaveholders, these poor, white\r\nmechanics in Mr. Gardiner’s ship-yard—instead of applying the natural,\r\nhonest remedy for the apprehended evil, and objecting at once to work\r\nthere by the side of slaves—made a cowardly attack upon the free\r\ncolored mechanics, saying _they_ were eating the bread which should be\r\neaten by American freemen, and swearing that they would not work with\r\nthem. The feeling was, _really_, against having their labor brought\r\ninto competition with that of the colored people at all; but it was too\r\nmuch to strike directly at the interest of the slaveholders; and,\r\ntherefore proving their servility and cowardice they dealt their blows\r\non the poor, colored freeman, and aimed to prevent _him_ from serving\r\nhimself, in the evening of life, with the trade with which he had\r\nserved his master, during the more vigorous portion of his days. Had\r\nthey succeeded in driving the black freemen out of the ship-yard, they\r\nwould have determined also upon the removal of the black slaves. The\r\nfeeling was very bitter toward all colored people in Baltimore, about\r\nthis time (1836), and they—free and slave suffered all manner of insult\r\nand wrong.\r\n\r\nUntil a very little before I went there, white and black ship\r\ncarpenters worked side by side, in the ship yards of Mr. Gardiner, Mr.\r\nDuncan, Mr. Walter Price, and Mr. Robb. Nobody seemed to see any\r\nimpropriety in it. To outward seeming, all hands were well satisfied.\r\nSome of the blacks were first rate workmen, and were given jobs\r\nrequiring highest skill. All at once, however, the white carpenters\r\nknocked off, and swore that they would no longer work on the same stage\r\nwith free Negroes. Taking advantage of the heavy contract resting upon\r\nMr. Gardiner, to have the war vessels for Mexico ready to launch in\r\nJuly, and of the difficulty of getting other hands at that season of\r\nthe year, they swore they would not strike another blow for him, unless\r\nhe would discharge his free colored workmen.\r\n\r\nNow, although this movement did not extend to me, _in form_, it did\r\nreach me, _in fact_. The spirit which it awakened was one of malice and\r\nbitterness, toward colored people _generally_, and I suffered with the\r\nrest, and suffered severely. My fellow apprentices very soon began to\r\nfeel it to be degrading to work with me. They began to put on high\r\nlooks, and to talk contemptuously and maliciously of _“the Niggers;”_\r\nsaying, that “they would take the country,” that “they ought to be\r\nkilled.” Encouraged by the cowardly workmen, who, knowing me to be a\r\nslave, made no issue with Mr. Gardiner about my being there, these\r\nyoung men did their utmost to make it impossible for me to stay. They\r\nseldom called me to do any thing, without coupling the call with a\r\ncurse, and Edward North, the biggest in every thing, rascality\r\nincluded, ventured to strike me, whereupon I picked him up, and threw\r\nhim into the dock. Whenever any of them struck me, I struck back again,\r\nregardless of consequences. I could manage any of them _singly_, and,\r\nwhile I could keep them from combining, I succeeded very well. In the\r\nconflict which ended my stay at Mr. Gardiner’s, I was beset by four of\r\nthem at once—Ned North, Ned Hays, Bill Stewart, and Tom Humphreys. Two\r\nof them were as large as myself, and they came near killing me, in\r\nbroad day light. The attack was made suddenly, and simultaneously. One\r\ncame in front, armed with a brick; there was one at each side, and one\r\nbehind, and they closed up around me. I was struck on all sides; and,\r\nwhile I was attending to those in front, I received a blow on my head,\r\nfrom behind, dealt with a heavy hand-spike. I was completely stunned by\r\nthe blow, and fell, heavily, on the ground, among the timbers. Taking\r\nadvantage of my fall, they rushed upon me, and began to pound me with\r\ntheir fists. I let them lay on, for a while, after I came to myself,\r\nwith a view of gaining strength. They did me little damage, so far;\r\nbut, finally, getting tired of that sport, I gave a sudden surge, and,\r\ndespite their weight, I rose to my hands and knees. Just as I did this,\r\none of their number (I know not which) planted a blow with his boot in\r\nmy left eye, which, for a time, seemed to have burst my eyeball. When\r\nthey saw my eye completely closed, my face covered with blood, and I\r\nstaggering under the stunning blows they had given me, they left me. As\r\nsoon as I gathered sufficient strength, I picked up the hand-spike,\r\nand, madly enough, attempted to pursue them; but here the carpenters\r\ninterfered, and compelled me to give up my frenzied pursuit. It was\r\nimpossible to stand against so many.\r\n\r\nDear reader, you can hardly believe the statement, but it is true, and,\r\ntherefore, I write it down: not fewer than fifty white men stood by,\r\nand saw this brutal and shameless outrage committed, and not a man of\r\nthem all interposed a single word of mercy. There were four against\r\none, and that one’s face was beaten and battered most horribly, and no\r\none said, “that is enough;” but some cried out, “Kill him—kill him—kill\r\nthe d—d nigger! knock his brains out—he struck a white person.” I\r\nmention this inhuman outcry, to show the character of the men, and the\r\nspirit of the times, at Gardiner’s ship yard, and, indeed, in Baltimore\r\ngenerally, in 1836. As I look back to this period, I am almost amazed\r\nthat I was not murdered outright, in that ship yard, so murderous was\r\nthe spirit which prevailed there. On two occasions, while there, I came\r\nnear losing my life. I was driving bolts in the hold, through the\r\nkeelson, with Hays. In its course, the bolt bent. Hays cursed me, and\r\nsaid that it was my blow which bent the bolt. I denied this, and\r\ncharged it upon him. In a fit of rage he seized an adze, and darted\r\ntoward me. I met him with a maul, and parried his blow, or I should\r\nhave then lost my life. A son of old Tom Lanman (the latter’s double\r\nmurder I have elsewhere charged upon him), in the spirit of his\r\nmiserable father, made an assault upon me, but the blow with his maul\r\nmissed me. After the united assault of North, Stewart, Hays and\r\nHumphreys, finding that the carpenters were as bitter toward me as the\r\napprentices, and that the latter were probably set on by the former, I\r\nfound my only chances for life was in flight. I succeeded in getting\r\naway, without an additional blow. To strike a white man, was death, by\r\nLynch law, in Gardiner’s ship yard; nor was there much of any other law\r\ntoward colored people, at that time, in any other part of Maryland. The\r\nwhole sentiment of Baltimore was murderous.\r\n\r\nAfter making my escape from the ship yard, I went straight home, and\r\nrelated the story of the outrage to Master Hugh Auld; and it is due to\r\nhim to say, that his conduct—though he was not a religious man—was\r\nevery way more humane than that of his brother, Thomas, when I went to\r\nthe latter in a somewhat similar plight, from the hands of _“Brother\r\nEdward Covey.”_ He listened attentively to my narration of the\r\ncircumstances leading to the ruffianly outrage, and gave many proofs of\r\nhis strong indignation at what was done. Hugh was a rough, but\r\nmanly-hearted fellow, and, at this time, his best nature showed itself.\r\n\r\nThe heart of my once almost over-kind mistress, Sophia, was again\r\nmelted in pity toward me. My puffed-out eye, and my scarred and\r\nblood-covered face, moved the dear lady to tears. She kindly drew a\r\nchair by me, and with friendly, consoling words, she took water, and\r\nwashed the blood from my face. No mother’s hand could have been more\r\ntender than hers. She bound up my head, and covered my wounded eye with\r\na lean piece of fresh beef. It was almost compensation for the\r\nmurderous assault, and my suffering, that it furnished and occasion for\r\nthe manifestation, once more, of the orignally(sic) characteristic\r\nkindness of my mistress. Her affectionate heart was not yet dead,\r\nthough much hardened by time and by circumstances.\r\n\r\nAs for Master Hugh’s part, as I have said, he was furious about it; and\r\nhe gave expression to his fury in the usual forms of speech in that\r\nlocality. He poured curses on the heads of the whole ship yard company,\r\nand swore that he would have satisfaction for the outrage. His\r\nindignation was really strong and healthy; but, unfortunately, it\r\nresulted from the thought that his rights of property, in my person,\r\nhad not been respected, more than from any sense of the outrage\r\ncommitted on me _as a man_. I inferred as much as this, from the fact\r\nthat he could, himself, beat and mangle when it suited him to do so.\r\nBent on having satisfaction, as he said, just as soon as I got a little\r\nthe better of my bruises, Master Hugh took me to Esquire Watson’s\r\noffice, on Bond street, Fell’s Point, with a view to procuring the\r\narrest of those who had assaulted me. He related the outrage to the\r\nmagistrate, as I had related it to him, and seemed to expect that a\r\nwarrant would, at once, be issued for the arrest of the lawless\r\nruffians.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson heard it all, and instead of drawing up his warrant, he\r\ninquired.—\r\n\r\n“Mr. Auld, who saw this assault of which you speak?”\r\n\r\n“It was done, sir, in the presence of a ship yard full of hands.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Watson, “I am sorry, but I cannot move in this matter\r\nexcept upon the oath of white witnesses.”\r\n\r\n“But here’s the boy; look at his head and face,” said the excited\r\nMaster Hugh; _“they_ show _what_ has been done.”\r\n\r\nBut Watson insisted that he was not authorized to do anything, unless\r\n_white_ witnesses of the transaction would come forward, and testify to\r\nwhat had taken place. He could issue no warrant on my word, against\r\nwhite persons; and, if I had been killed in the presence of a _thousand\r\nblacks_, their testimony, combined would have been insufficient to\r\narrest a single murderer. Master Hugh, for once, was compelled to say,\r\nthat this state of things was _too bad;_ and he left the office of the\r\nmagistrate, disgusted.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was impossible to get any white man to testify against my\r\nassailants. The carpenters saw what was done; but the actors were but\r\nthe agents of their malice, and only what the carpenters sanctioned.\r\nThey had cried, with one accord, _“Kill the nigger!” “Kill the\r\nnigger!”_ Even those who may have pitied me, if any such were among\r\nthem, lacked the moral courage to come and volunteer their evidence.\r\nThe slightest manifestation of sympathy or justice toward a person of\r\ncolor, was denounced as abolitionism; and the name of abolitionist,\r\nsubjected its bearer to frightful liabilities. “D—n _abolitionists,”_\r\nand _“Kill the niggers,”_ were the watch-words of the foul-mouthed\r\nruffians of those days. Nothing was done, and probably there would not\r\nhave been any thing done, had I been killed in the affray. The laws and\r\nthe morals of the Christian city of Baltimore, afforded no protection\r\nto the sable denizens of that city.\r\n\r\nMaster Hugh, on finding he could get no redress for the cruel wrong,\r\nwithdrew me from the employment of Mr. Gardiner, and took me into his\r\nown family, Mrs. Auld kindly taking care of me, and dressing my wounds,\r\nuntil they were healed, and I was ready to go again to work.\r\n\r\nWhile I was on the Eastern Shore, Master Hugh had met with reverses,\r\nwhich overthrew his business; and he had given up ship building in his\r\nown yard, on the City Block, and was now acting as foreman of Mr.\r\nWalter Price. The best he could now do for me, was to take me into Mr.\r\nPrice’s yard, and afford me the facilities there, for completing the\r\ntrade which I had began to learn at Gardiner’s. Here I rapidly became\r\nexpert in the use of my calking tools; and, in the course of a single\r\nyear, I was able to command the highest wages paid to journeymen\r\ncalkers in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that I was now of some pecuniary value to my\r\nmaster. During the busy season, I was bringing six and seven dollars\r\nper week. I have, sometimes, brought him as much as nine dollars a\r\nweek, for the wages were a dollar and a half per day.\r\n\r\nAfter learning to calk, I sought my own employment, made my own\r\ncontracts, and collected my own earnings; giving Master Hugh no trouble\r\nin any part of the transactions to which I was a party.\r\n\r\nHere, then, were better days for the Eastern Shore _slave_. I was now\r\nfree from the vexatious assalts(sic) of the apprentices at Mr.\r\nGardiner’s; and free from the perils of plantation life, and once more\r\nin a favorable condition to increase my little stock of education,\r\nwhich had been at a dead stand since my removal from Baltimore. I had,\r\non the Eastern Shore, been only a teacher, when in company with other\r\nslaves, but now there were colored persons who could instruct me. Many\r\nof the young calkers could read, write and cipher. Some of them had\r\nhigh notions about mental improvement; and the free ones, on Fell’s\r\nPoint, organized what they called the _“East Baltimore Mental\r\nImprovement Society.”_ To this society, notwithstanding it was intended\r\nthat only free persons should attach themselves, I was admitted, and\r\nwas, several times, assigned a prominent part in its debates. I owe\r\nmuch to the society of these young men.\r\n\r\nThe reader already knows enough of the _ill_ effects of good treatment\r\non a slave, to anticipate what was now the case in my improved\r\ncondition. It was not long before I began to show signs of disquiet\r\nwith slavery, and to look around for means to get out of that condition\r\nby the shortest route. I was living among _free men;_ and was, in all\r\nrespects, equal to them by nature and by attainments. _Why should I be\r\na slave?_ There was _no_ reason why I should be the thrall of any man.\r\n\r\nBesides, I was now getting—as I have said—a dollar and fifty cents per\r\nday. I contracted for it, worked for it, earned it, collected it; it\r\nwas paid to me, and it was _rightfully_ my own; and yet, upon every\r\nreturning Saturday night, this money—my own hard earnings, every cent\r\nof it—was demanded of me, and taken from me by Master Hugh. He did not\r\nearn it; he had no hand in earning it; why, then, should he have it? I\r\nowed him nothing. He had given me no schooling, and I had received from\r\nhim only my food and raiment; and for these, my services were supposed\r\nto pay, from the first. The right to take my earnings, was the right of\r\nthe robber. He had the power to compel me to give him the fruits of my\r\nlabor, and this power was his only right in the case. I became more and\r\nmore dissatisfied with this state of things; and, in so becoming, I\r\nonly gave proof of the same human nature which every reader of this\r\nchapter in my life—slaveholder, or nonslaveholder—is conscious of\r\npossessing.\r\n\r\nTo make a contented slave, you must make a thoughtless one. It is\r\nnecessary to darken his moral and mental vision, and, as far as\r\npossible, to annihilate his power of reason. He must be able to detect\r\nno inconsistencies in slavery. The man that takes his earnings, must be\r\nable to convince him that he has a perfect right to do so. It must not\r\ndepend upon mere force; the slave must know no Higher Law than his\r\nmaster’s will. The whole relationship must not only demonstrate, to his\r\nmind, its necessity, but its absolute rightfulness. If there be one\r\ncrevice through which a single drop can fall, it will certainly rust\r\noff the slave’s chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. _My Escape from Slavery_\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOSING INCIDENTS OF “MY LIFE AS A SLAVE”—REASONS WHY FULL PARTICULARS\r\nOF THE MANNER OF MY ESCAPE WILL NOT BE GIVEN—CRAFTINESS AND MALICE OF\r\nSLAVEHOLDERS—SUSPICION OF AIDING A SLAVE’S ESCAPE ABOUT AS DANGEROUS AS\r\nPOSITIVE EVIDENCE—WANT OF WISDOM SHOWN IN PUBLISHING DETAILS OF THE\r\nESCAPE OF THE FUGITIVES—PUBLISHED ACCOUNTS REACH THE MASTERS, NOT THE\r\nSLAVES—SLAVEHOLDERS STIMULATED TO GREATER WATCHFULNESS—MY\r\nCONDITION—DISCONTENT—SUSPICIONS IMPLIED BY MASTER HUGH’S MANNER, WHEN\r\nRECEIVING MY WAGES—HIS OCCASIONAL GENEROSITY!—DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY\r\nOF ESCAPE—EVERY AVENUE GUARDED—PLAN TO OBTAIN MONEY—I AM ALLOWED TO\r\nHIRE MY TIME—A GLEAM OF HOPE—ATTENDS CAMP-MEETING, WITHOUT\r\nPERMISSION—ANGER OF MASTER HUGH THEREAT—THE RESULT—MY PLANS OF ESCAPE\r\nACCELERATED THERBY—THE DAY FOR MY DEPARTURE FIXED—HARASSED BY DOUBTS\r\nAND FEARS—PAINFUL THOUGHTS OF SEPARATION FROM FRIENDS—THE ATTEMPT\r\nMADE—ITS SUCCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will now make the kind reader acquainted with the closing incidents\r\nof my “Life as a Slave,” having already trenched upon the limit\r\nallotted to my “Life as a Freeman.” Before, however, proceeding with\r\nthis narration, it is, perhaps, proper that I should frankly state, in\r\nadvance, my intention to withhold a part of the(sic) connected with my\r\nescape from slavery. There are reasons for this suppression, which I\r\ntrust the reader will deem altogether valid. It may be easily\r\nconceived, that a full and complete statement of all facts pertaining\r\nto the flight of a bondman, might implicate and embarrass some who may\r\nhave, wittingly or unwittingly, assisted him; and no one can wish me to\r\ninvolve any man or woman who has befriended me, even in the liability\r\nof embarrassment or trouble.\r\n\r\nKeen is the scent of the slaveholder; like the fangs of the\r\nrattlesnake, his malice retains its poison long; and, although it is\r\nnow nearly seventeen years since I made my escape, it is well to be\r\ncareful, in dealing with the circumstances relating to it. Were I to\r\ngive but a shadowy outline of the process adopted, with characteristic\r\naptitude, the crafty and malicious among the slaveholders might,\r\npossibly, hit upon the track I pursued, and involve some one in\r\nsuspicion which, in a slave state, is about as bad as positive\r\nevidence. The colored man, there, must not only shun evil, but shun the\r\nvery _appearance_ of evil, or be condemned as a criminal. A\r\nslaveholding community has a peculiar taste for ferreting out offenses\r\nagainst the slave system, justice there being more sensitive in its\r\nregard for the peculiar rights of this system, than for any other\r\ninterest or institution. By stringing together a train of events and\r\ncircumstances, even if I were not very explicit, the means of escape\r\nmight be ascertained, and, possibly, those means be rendered,\r\nthereafter, no longer available to the liberty-seeking children of\r\nbondage I have left behind me. No antislavery man can wish me to do\r\nanything favoring such results, and no slaveholding reader has any\r\nright to expect the impartment of such information.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, it would afford me pleasure, and perhaps would\r\nmaterially add to the interest of my story, were I at liberty to\r\ngratify a curiosity which I know to exist in the minds of many, as to\r\nthe manner of my escape, I must deprive myself of this pleasure, and\r\nthe curious of the gratification, which such a statement of facts would\r\nafford. I would allow myself to suffer under the greatest imputations\r\nthat evil minded men might suggest, rather than exculpate myself by\r\nexplanation, and thereby run the hazards of closing the slightest\r\navenue by which a brother in suffering might clear himself of the\r\nchains and fetters of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe practice of publishing every new invention by which a slave is\r\nknown to have escaped from slavery, has neither wisdom nor necessity to\r\nsustain it. Had not Henry Box Brown and his friends attracted\r\nslaveholding attention to the manner of his escape, we might have had a\r\nthousand _Box Browns_ per annum. The singularly original plan adopted\r\nby William and Ellen Crafts, perished with the first using, because\r\nevery slaveholder in the land was apprised of it. The _salt water\r\nslave_ who hung in the guards of a steamer, being washed three days and\r\nthree nights—like another Jonah—by the waves of the sea, has, by the\r\npublicity given to the circumstance, set a spy on the guards of every\r\nsteamer departing from southern ports.\r\n\r\nI have never approved of the very public manner, in which some of our\r\nwestern friends have conducted what _they_ call the _“Under-ground\r\nRailroad,”_ but which, I think, by their open declarations, has been\r\nmade, most emphatically, the _“Upper_-ground Railroad.” Its stations\r\nare far better known to the slaveholders than to the slaves. I honor\r\nthose good men and women for their noble daring, in willingly\r\nsubjecting themselves to persecution, by openly avowing their\r\nparticipation in the escape of slaves; nevertheless, the good resulting\r\nfrom such avowals, is of a very questionable character. It may kindle\r\nan enthusiasm, very pleasant to inhale; but that is of no practical\r\nbenefit to themselves, nor to the slaves escaping. Nothing is more\r\nevident, than that such disclosures are a positive evil to the slaves\r\nremaining, and seeking to escape. In publishing such accounts, the\r\nanti-slavery man addresses the slaveholder, _not the slave;_ he\r\nstimulates the former to greater watchfulness, and adds to his\r\nfacilities for capturing his slave. We owe something to the slaves,\r\nsouth of Mason and Dixon’s line, as well as to those north of it; and,\r\nin discharging the duty of aiding the latter, on their way to freedom,\r\nwe should be careful to do nothing which would be likely to hinder the\r\nformer, in making their escape from slavery. Such is my detestation of\r\nslavery, that I would keep the merciless slaveholder profoundly\r\nignorant of the means of flight adopted by the slave. He should be left\r\nto imagine himself surrounded by myriads of invisible tormentors, ever\r\nready to snatch, from his infernal grasp, his trembling prey. In\r\npursuing his victim, let him be left to feel his way in the dark; let\r\nshades of darkness, commensurate with his crime, shut every ray of\r\nlight from his pathway; and let him be made to feel, that, at every\r\nstep he takes, with the hellish purpose of reducing a brother man to\r\nslavery, he is running the frightful risk of having his hot brains\r\ndashed out by an invisible hand.\r\n\r\nBut, enough of this. I will now proceed to the statement of those\r\nfacts, connected with my escape, for which I am alone responsible, and\r\nfor which no one can be made to suffer but myself.\r\n\r\nMy condition in the year (1838) of my escape, was, comparatively, a\r\nfree and easy one, so far, at least, as the wants of the physical man\r\nwere concerned; but the reader will bear in mind, that my troubles from\r\nthe beginning, have been less physical than mental, and he will thus be\r\nprepared to find, after what is narrated in the previous chapters, that\r\nslave life was adding nothing to its charms for me, as I grew older,\r\nand became better acquainted with it. The practice, from week to week,\r\nof openly robbing me of all my earnings, kept the nature and character\r\nof slavery constantly before me. I could be robbed by _indirection_,\r\nbut this was _too_ open and barefaced to be endured. I could see no\r\nreason why I should, at the end of each week, pour the reward of my\r\nhonest toil into the purse of any man. The thought itself vexed me, and\r\nthe manner in which Master Hugh received my wages, vexed me more than\r\nthe original wrong. Carefully counting the money and rolling it out,\r\ndollar by dollar, he would look me in the face, as if he would search\r\nmy heart as well as my pocket, and reproachfully ask me, “_Is that\r\nall_?”—implying that I had, perhaps, kept back part of my wages; or, if\r\nnot so, the demand was made, possibly, to make me feel, that, after\r\nall, I was an “unprofitable servant.” Draining me of the last cent of\r\nmy hard earnings, he would, however, occasionally—when I brought home\r\nan extra large sum—dole out to me a sixpence or a shilling, with a\r\nview, perhaps, of kindling up my gratitude; but this practice had the\r\nopposite effect—it was an admission of _my right to the whole sum_. The\r\nfact, that he gave me any part of my wages, was proof that he suspected\r\nthat I had a right _to the whole of them_. I always felt uncomfortable,\r\nafter having received anything in this way, for I feared that the\r\ngiving me a few cents, might, possibly, ease his conscience, and make\r\nhim feel himself a pretty honorable robber, after all!\r\n\r\nHeld to a strict account, and kept under a close watch—the old\r\nsuspicion of my running away not having been entirely removed—escape\r\nfrom slavery, even in Baltimore, was very difficult. The railroad from\r\nBaltimore to Philadelphia was under regulations so stringent, that even\r\n_free_ colored travelers were almost excluded. They must have _free_\r\npapers; they must be measured and carefully examined, before they were\r\nallowed to enter the cars; they only went in the day time, even when so\r\nexamined. The steamboats were under regulations equally stringent. All\r\nthe great turnpikes, leading northward, were beset with kidnappers, a\r\nclass of men who watched the newspapers for advertisements for runaway\r\nslaves, making their living by the accursed reward of slave hunting.\r\n\r\nMy discontent grew upon me, and I was on the look-out for means of\r\nescape. With money, I could easily have managed the matter, and,\r\ntherefore, I hit upon the plan of soliciting the privilege of hiring my\r\ntime. It is quite common, in Baltimore, to allow slaves this privilege,\r\nand it is the practice, also, in New Orleans. A slave who is considered\r\ntrustworthy, can, by paying his master a definite sum regularly, at the\r\nend of each week, dispose of his time as he likes. It so happened that\r\nI was not in very good odor, and I was far from being a trustworthy\r\nslave. Nevertheless, I watched my opportunity when Master Thomas came\r\nto Baltimore (for I was still his property, Hugh only acted as his\r\nagent) in the spring of 1838, to purchase his spring supply of goods,\r\nand applied to him, directly, for the much-coveted privilege of hiring\r\nmy time. This request Master Thomas unhesitatingly refused to grant;\r\nand he charged me, with some sternness, with inventing this stratagem\r\nto make my escape. He told me, “I could go _nowhere_ but he could catch\r\nme; and, in the event of my running away, I might be assured he should\r\nspare no pains in his efforts to recapture me.” He recounted, with a\r\ngood deal of eloquence, the many kind offices he had done me, and\r\nexhorted me to be contented and obedient. “Lay out no plans for the\r\nfuture,” said he. “If you behave yourself properly, I will take care of\r\nyou.” Now, kind and considerate as this offer was, it failed to soothe\r\nme into repose. In spite of Master Thomas, and, I may say, in spite of\r\nmyself, also, I continued to think, and worse still, to think almost\r\nexclusively about the injustice and wickedness of slavery. No effort of\r\nmine or of his could silence this trouble-giving thought, or change my\r\npurpose to run away.\r\n\r\nAbout two months after applying to Master Thomas for the privilege of\r\nhiring my time, I applied to Master Hugh for the same liberty,\r\nsupposing him to be unacquainted with the fact that I had made a\r\nsimilar application to Master Thomas, and had been refused. My boldness\r\nin making this request, fairly astounded him at the first. He gazed at\r\nme in amazement. But I had many good reasons for pressing the matter;\r\nand, after listening to them awhile, he did not absolutely refuse, but\r\ntold me he would think of it. Here, then, was a gleam of hope. Once\r\nmaster of my own time, I felt sure that I could make, over and above my\r\nobligation to him, a dollar or two every week. Some slaves have made\r\nenough, in this way, to purchase their freedom. It is a sharp spur to\r\nindustry; and some of the most enterprising colored men in Baltimore\r\nhire themselves in this way. After mature reflection—as I must suppose\r\nit was Master Hugh granted me the privilege in question, on the\r\nfollowing terms: I was to be allowed all my time; to make all bargains\r\nfor work; to find my own employment, and to collect my own wages; and,\r\nin return for this liberty, I was required, or obliged, to pay him\r\nthree dollars at the end of each week, and to board and clothe myself,\r\nand buy my own calking tools. A failure in any of these particulars\r\nwould put an end to my privilege. This was a hard bargain. The wear and\r\ntear of clothing, the losing and breaking of tools, and the expense of\r\nboard, made it necessary for me to earn at least six dollars per week,\r\nto keep even with the world. All who are acquainted with calking, know\r\nhow uncertain and irregular that employment is. It can be done to\r\nadvantage only in dry weather, for it is useless to put wet oakum into\r\na seam. Rain or shine, however, work or no work, at the end of each\r\nweek the money must be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nMaster Hugh seemed to be very much pleased, for a time, with this\r\narrangement; and well he might be, for it was decidedly in his favor.\r\nIt relieved him of all anxiety concerning me. His money was sure. He\r\nhad armed my love of liberty with a lash and a driver, far more\r\nefficient than any I had before known; and, while he derived all the\r\nbenefits of slaveholding by the arrangement, without its evils, I\r\nendured all the evils of being a slave, and yet suffered all the care\r\nand anxiety of a responsible freeman. “Nevertheless,” thought I, “it is\r\na valuable privilege another step in my career toward freedom.” It was\r\nsomething even to be permitted to stagger under the disadvantages of\r\nliberty, and I was determined to hold on to the newly gained footing,\r\nby all proper industry. I was ready to work by night as well as by day;\r\nand being in the enjoyment of excellent health, I was able not only to\r\nmeet my current expenses, but also to lay by a small sum at the end of\r\neach week. All went on thus, from the month of May till August;\r\nthen—for reasons which will become apparent as I proceed—my much valued\r\nliberty was wrested from me.\r\n\r\nDuring the week previous to this (to me) calamitous event, I had made\r\narrangements with a few young friends, to accompany them, on Saturday\r\nnight, to a camp-meeting, held about twelve miles from Baltimore. On\r\nthe evening of our intended start for the camp-ground, something\r\noccurred in the ship yard where I was at work, which detained me\r\nunusually late, and compelled me either to disappoint my young friends,\r\nor to neglect carrying my weekly dues to Master Hugh. Knowing that I\r\nhad the money, and could hand it to him on another day, I decided to go\r\nto camp-meeting, and to pay him the three dollars, for the past week,\r\non my return. Once on the camp-ground, I was induced to remain one day\r\nlonger than I had intended, when I left home. But, as soon as I\r\nreturned, I went straight to his house on Fell street, to hand him his\r\n(my) money. Unhappily, the fatal mistake had been committed. I found\r\nhim exceedingly angry. He exhibited all the signs of apprehension and\r\nwrath, which a slaveholder may be surmised to exhibit on the supposed\r\nescape of a favorite slave. “You rascal! I have a great mind to give\r\nyou a severe whipping. How dare you go out of the city without first\r\nasking and obtaining my permission?” “Sir,” said I, “I hired my time\r\nand paid you the price you asked for it. I did not know that it was any\r\npart of the bargain that I should ask you when or where I should go.”\r\n\r\n“You did not know, you rascal! You are bound to show yourself here\r\nevery Saturday night.” After reflecting, a few moments, he became\r\nsomewhat cooled down; but, evidently greatly troubled, he said, “Now,\r\nyou scoundrel! you have done for yourself; you shall hire your time no\r\nlonger. The next thing I shall hear of, will be your running away.\r\nBring home your tools and your clothes, at once. I’ll teach you how to\r\ngo off in this way.”\r\n\r\nThus ended my partial freedom. I could hire my time no longer; and I\r\nobeyed my master’s orders at once. The little taste of liberty which I\r\nhad had—although as the reader will have seen, it was far from being\r\nunalloyed—by no means enhanced my contentment with slavery. Punished\r\nthus by Master Hugh, it was now my turn to punish him. “Since,” thought\r\nI, “you _will_ make a slave of me, I will await your orders in all\r\nthings;” and, instead of going to look for work on Monday morning, as I\r\nhad formerly done, I remained at home during the entire week, without\r\nthe performance of a single stroke of work. Saturday night came, and he\r\ncalled upon me, as usual, for my wages. I, of course, told him I had\r\ndone no work, and had no wages. Here we were at the point of coming to\r\nblows. His wrath had been accumulating during the whole week; for he\r\nevidently saw that I was making no effort to get work, but was most\r\naggravatingly awaiting his orders, in all things. As I look back to\r\nthis behavior of mine, I scarcely know what possessed me, thus to\r\ntrifle with those who had such unlimited power to bless or to blast me.\r\nMaster Hugh raved and swore his determination to _“get hold of me;”_\r\nbut, wisely for _him_, and happily for _me_, his wrath only employed\r\nthose very harmless, impalpable missiles, which roll from a limber\r\ntongue. In my desperation, I had fully made up my mind to measure\r\nstrength with Master Hugh, in case he should undertake to execute his\r\nthreats. I am glad there was no necessity for this; for resistance to\r\nhim could not have ended so happily for me, as it did in the case of\r\nCovey. He was not a man to be safely resisted by a slave; and I freely\r\nown, that in my conduct toward him, in this instance, there was more\r\nfolly than wisdom. Master Hugh closed his reproofs, by telling me that,\r\nhereafter, I need give myself no uneasiness about getting work; that he\r\n“would, himself, see to getting work for me, and enough of it, at\r\nthat.” This threat I confess had some terror in it; and, on thinking\r\nthe matter over, during the Sunday, I resolved, not only to save him\r\nthe trouble of getting me work, but that, upon the third day of\r\nSeptember, I would attempt to make my escape from slavery. The refusal\r\nto allow me to hire my time, therefore, hastened the period of flight.\r\nI had three weeks, now, in which to prepare for my journey.\r\n\r\nOnce resolved, I felt a certain degree of repose, and on Monday,\r\ninstead of waiting for Master Hugh to seek employment for me, I was up\r\nby break of day, and off to the ship yard of Mr. Butler, on the City\r\nBlock, near the draw-bridge. I was a favorite with Mr. B., and, young\r\nas I was, I had served as his foreman on the float stage, at calking.\r\nOf course, I easily obtained work, and, at the end of the week—which by\r\nthe way was exceedingly fine I brought Master Hugh nearly nine dollars.\r\nThe effect of this mark of returning good sense, on my part, was\r\nexcellent. He was very much pleased; he took the money, commended me,\r\nand told me I might have done the same thing the week before. It is a\r\nblessed thing that the tyrant may not always know the thoughts and\r\npurposes of his victim. Master Hugh little knew what my plans were. The\r\ngoing to camp-meeting without asking his permission—the insolent\r\nanswers made to his reproaches—the sulky deportment the week after\r\nbeing deprived of the privilege of hiring my time—had awakened in him\r\nthe suspicion that I might be cherishing disloyal purposes. My object,\r\ntherefore, in working steadily, was to remove suspicion, and in this I\r\nsucceeded admirably. He probably thought I was never better satisfied\r\nwith my condition, than at the very time I was planning my escape. The\r\nsecond week passed, and again I carried him my full week’s wages—_nine\r\ndollars;_ and so well pleased was he, that he gave me TWENTY-FIVE\r\nCENTS! and “bade me make good use of it!” I told him I would, for one\r\nof the uses to which I meant to put it, was to pay my fare on the\r\nunderground railroad.\r\n\r\nThings without went on as usual; but I was passing through the same\r\ninternal excitement and anxiety which I had experienced two years and a\r\nhalf before. The failure, in that instance, was not calculated to\r\nincrease my confidence in the success of this, my second attempt; and I\r\nknew that a second failure could not leave me where my first did—I must\r\neither get to the _far north_, or be sent to the _far south_. Besides\r\nthe exercise of mind from this state of facts, I had the painful\r\nsensation of being about to separate from a circle of honest and warm\r\nhearted friends, in Baltimore. The thought of such a separation, where\r\nthe hope of ever meeting again is excluded, and where there can be no\r\ncorrespondence, is very painful. It is my opinion, that thousands would\r\nescape from slavery who now remain there, but for the strong cords of\r\naffection that bind them to their families, relatives and friends. The\r\ndaughter is hindered from escaping, by the love she bears her mother,\r\nand the father, by the love he bears his children; and so, to the end\r\nof the chapter. I had no relations in Baltimore, and I saw no\r\nprobability of ever living in the neighborhood of sisters and brothers;\r\nbut the thought of leaving my friends, was among the strongest\r\nobstacles to my running away. The last two days of the week—Friday and\r\nSaturday—were spent mostly in collecting my things together, for my\r\njourney. Having worked four days that week, for my master, I handed him\r\nsix dollars, on Saturday night. I seldom spent my Sundays at home; and,\r\nfor fear that something might be discovered in my conduct, I kept up my\r\ncustom, and absented myself all day. On Monday, the third day of\r\nSeptember, 1838, in accordance with my resolution, I bade farewell to\r\nthe city of Baltimore, and to that slavery which had been my abhorrence\r\nfrom childhood.\r\n\r\nHow I got away—in what direction I traveled—whether by land or by\r\nwater; whether with or without assistance—must, for reasons already\r\nmentioned, remain unexplained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE as a FREEMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. _Liberty Attained_\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSITION FROM SLAVERY TO FREEDOM—A WANDERER IN NEW YORK—FEELINGS ON\r\nREACHING THAT CITY—AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE MET—UNFAVORABLE\r\nIMPRESSIONS—LONELINESS AND INSECURITY—APOLOGY FOR SLAVES WHO RETURN TO\r\nTHEIR MASTERS—COMPELLED TO TELL MY CONDITION—SUCCORED BY A SAILOR—DAVID\r\nRUGGLES—THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD—MARRIAGE—BAGGAGE TAKEN FROM\r\nME—KINDNESS OF NATHAN JOHNSON—MY CHANGE OF NAME—DARK NOTIONS OF\r\nNORTHERN CIVILIZATION—THE CONTRAST—COLORED PEOPLE IN NEW BEDFORD—AN\r\nINCIDENT ILLUSTRATING THEIR SPIRIT—A COMMON LABORER—DENIED WORK AT MY\r\nTRADE—THE FIRST WINTER AT THE NORTH—REPULSE AT THE DOORS OF THE\r\nCHURCH—SANCTIFIED HATE—THE _Liberator_ AND ITS EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity for any extended notice of the incidents of this\r\npart of my life. There is nothing very striking or peculiar about my\r\ncareer as a freeman, when viewed apart from my life as a slave. The\r\nrelation subsisting between my early experience and that which I am now\r\nabout to narrate, is, perhaps, my best apology for adding another\r\nchapter to this book.\r\n\r\nDisappearing from the kind reader, in a flying cloud or balloon (pardon\r\nthe figure), driven by the wind, and knowing not where I should\r\nland—whether in slavery or in freedom—it is proper that I should\r\nremove, at once, all anxiety, by frankly making known where I alighted.\r\nThe flight was a bold and perilous one; but here I am, in the great\r\ncity of New York, safe and sound, without loss of blood or bone. In\r\nless than a week after leaving Baltimore, I was walking amid the\r\nhurrying throng, and gazing upon the dazzling wonders of Broadway. The\r\ndreams of my childhood and the purposes of my manhood were now\r\nfulfilled. A free state around me, and a free earth under my feet! What\r\na moment was this to me! A whole year was pressed into a single day. A\r\nnew world burst upon my agitated vision. I have often been asked, by\r\nkind friends to whom I have told my story, how I felt when first I\r\nfound myself beyond the limits of slavery; and I must say here, as I\r\nhave often said to them, there is scarcely anything about which I could\r\nnot give a more satisfactory answer. It was a moment of joyous\r\nexcitement, which no words can describe. In a letter to a friend,\r\nwritten soon after reaching New York. I said I felt as one might be\r\nsupposed to feel, on escaping from a den of hungry lions. But, in a\r\nmoment like that, sensations are too intense and too rapid for words.\r\nAnguish and grief, like darkness and rain, may be described, but joy\r\nand gladness, like the rainbow of promise, defy alike the pen and\r\npencil.\r\n\r\nFor ten or fifteen years I had been dragging a heavy chain, with a huge\r\nblock attached to it, cumbering my every motion. I had felt myself\r\ndoomed to drag this chain and this block through life. All efforts,\r\nbefore, to separate myself from the hateful encumbrance, had only\r\nseemed to rivet me the more firmly to it. Baffled and discouraged at\r\ntimes, I had asked myself the question, May not this, after all, be\r\nGod’s work? May He not, for wise ends, have doomed me to this lot? A\r\ncontest had been going on in my mind for years, between the clear\r\nconsciousness of right and the plausible errors of superstition;\r\nbetween the wisdom of manly courage, and the foolish weakness of\r\ntimidity. The contest was now ended; the chain was severed; God and\r\nright stood vindicated. I was A FREEMAN, and the voice of peace and joy\r\nthrilled my heart.\r\n\r\nFree and joyous, however, as I was, joy was not the only sensation I\r\nexperienced. It was like the quick blaze, beautiful at the first, but\r\nwhich subsiding, leaves the building charred and desolate. I was soon\r\ntaught that I was still in an enemy’s land. A sense of loneliness and\r\ninsecurity oppressed me sadly. I had been but a few hours in New York,\r\nbefore I was met in the streets by a fugitive slave, well known to me,\r\nand the information I got from him respecting New York, did nothing to\r\nlessen my apprehension of danger. The fugitive in question was\r\n“Allender’s Jake,” in Baltimore; but, said he, I am “WILLIAM DIXON,” in\r\nNew York! I knew Jake well, and knew when Tolly Allender and Mr. Price\r\n(for the latter employed Master Hugh as his foreman, in his shipyard on\r\nFell’s Point) made an attempt to recapture Jake, and failed. Jake told\r\nme all about his circumstances, and how narrowly he escaped being taken\r\nback to slavery; that the city was now full of southerners, returning\r\nfrom the springs; that the black people in New York were not to be\r\ntrusted; that there were hired men on the lookout for fugitives from\r\nslavery, and who, for a few dollars, would betray me into the hands of\r\nthe slave-catchers; that I must trust no man with my secret; that I\r\nmust not think of going either on the wharves to work, or to a\r\nboarding-house to board; and, worse still, this same Jake told me it\r\nwas not in his power to help me. He seemed, even while cautioning me,\r\nto be fearing lest, after all, I might be a party to a second attempt\r\nto recapture him. Under the inspiration of this thought, I must suppose\r\nit was, he gave signs of a wish to get rid of me, and soon left me his\r\nwhitewash brush in hand—as he said, for his work. He was soon lost to\r\nsight among the throng, and I was alone again, an easy prey to the\r\nkidnappers, if any should happen to be on my track.\r\n\r\nNew York, seventeen years ago, was less a place of safety for a runaway\r\nslave than now, and all know how unsafe it now is, under the new\r\nfugitive slave bill. I was much troubled. I had very little money\r\nenough to buy me a few loaves of bread, but not enough to pay board,\r\noutside a lumber yard. I saw the wisdom of keeping away from the ship\r\nyards, for if Master Hugh pursued me, he would naturally expect to find\r\nme looking for work among the calkers. For a time, every door seemed\r\nclosed against me. A sense of my loneliness and helplessness crept over\r\nme, and covered me with something bordering on despair. In the midst of\r\nthousands of my fellowmen, and yet a perfect stranger! In the midst of\r\nhuman brothers, and yet more fearful of them than of hungry wolves! I\r\nwas without home, without friends, without work, without money, and\r\nwithout any definite knowledge of which way to go, or where to look for\r\nsuccor.\r\n\r\nSome apology can easily be made for the few slaves who have, after\r\nmaking good their escape, turned back to slavery, preferring the actual\r\nrule of their masters, to the life of loneliness, apprehension, hunger,\r\nand anxiety, which meets them on their first arrival in a free state.\r\nIt is difficult for a freeman to enter into the feelings of such\r\nfugitives. He cannot see things in the same light with the slave,\r\nbecause he does not, and cannot, look from the same point from which\r\nthe slave does. “Why do you tremble,” he says to the slave “you are in\r\na free state;” but the difficulty is, in realizing that he is in a free\r\nstate, the slave might reply. A freeman cannot understand why the\r\nslave-master’s shadow is bigger, to the slave, than the might and\r\nmajesty of a free state; but when he reflects that the slave knows more\r\nabout the slavery of his master than he does of the might and majesty\r\nof the free state, he has the explanation. The slave has been all his\r\nlife learning the power of his master—being trained to dread his\r\napproach—and only a few hours learning the power of the state. The\r\nmaster is to him a stern and flinty reality, but the state is little\r\nmore than a dream. He has been accustomed to regard every white man as\r\nthe friend of his master, and every colored man as more or less under\r\nthe control of his master’s friends—the white people. It takes stout\r\nnerves to stand up, in such circumstances. A man, homeless,\r\nshelterless, breadless, friendless, and moneyless, is not in a\r\ncondition to assume a very proud or joyous tone; and in just this\r\ncondition was I, while wandering about the streets of New York city and\r\nlodging, at least one night, among the barrels on one of its wharves. I\r\nwas not only free from slavery, but I was free from home, as well. The\r\nreader will easily see that I had something more than the simple fact\r\nof being free to think of, in this extremity.\r\n\r\nI kept my secret as long as I could, and at last was forced to go in\r\nsearch of an honest man—a man sufficiently _human_ not to betray me\r\ninto the hands of slave-catchers. I was not a bad reader of the human\r\nface, nor long in selecting the right man, when once compelled to\r\ndisclose the facts of my condition to some one.\r\n\r\nI found my man in the person of one who said his name was Stewart. He\r\nwas a sailor, warm-hearted and generous, and he listened to my story\r\nwith a brother’s interest. I told him I was running for my freedom—knew\r\nnot where to go—money almost gone—was hungry—thought it unsafe to go\r\nthe shipyards for work, and needed a friend. Stewart promptly put me in\r\nthe way of getting out of my trouble. He took me to his house, and went\r\nin search of the late David Ruggles, who was then the secretary of the\r\nNew York Vigilance Committee, and a very active man in all anti-slavery\r\nworks. Once in the hands of Mr. Ruggles, I was comparatively safe. I\r\nwas hidden with Mr. Ruggles several days. In the meantime, my intended\r\nwife, Anna, came on from Baltimore—to whom I had written, informing her\r\nof my safe arrival at New York—and, in the presence of Mrs. Mitchell\r\nand Mr. Ruggles, we were married, by Rev. James W. C. Pennington.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruggles 7 was the first officer on the under-ground railroad with\r\nwhom I met after reaching the north, and, indeed, the first of whom I\r\never heard anything. Learning that I was a calker by trade, he promptly\r\ndecided that New Bedford was the proper place to send me. “Many ships,”\r\nsaid he, “are there fitted out for the whaling business, and you may\r\nthere find work at your trade, and make a good living.” Thus, in one\r\nfortnight after my flight from Maryland, I was safe in New Bedford,\r\nregularly entered upon the exercise of the rights, responsibilities,\r\nand duties of a freeman.\r\n\r\nI may mention a little circumstance which annoyed me on reaching New\r\nBedford. I had not a cent of money, and lacked two dollars toward\r\npaying our fare from Newport, and our baggage not very costly—was taken\r\nby the stage driver, and held until I could raise the money to redeem\r\nit. This difficulty was soon surmounted. Mr. Nathan Johnson, to whom we\r\nhad a line from Mr. Ruggles, not only received us kindly and\r\nhospitably, but, on being informed about our baggage, promptly loaned\r\nme two dollars with which to redeem my little property. I shall ever be\r\ndeeply grateful, both to Mr. and Mrs. Nathan Johnson, for the lively\r\ninterest they were pleased to take in me, in this hour of my extremest\r\nneed. They not only gave myself and wife bread and shelter, but taught\r\nus how to begin to secure those benefits for ourselves. Long may they\r\nlive, and may blessings attend them in this life and in that which is\r\nto come!\r\n\r\nOnce initiated into the new life of freedom, and assured by Mr. Johnson\r\nthat New Bedford was a safe place, the comparatively unimportant\r\nmatter, as to what should be my name, came up for considertion(sic). It\r\nwas necessary to have a name in my new relations. The name given me by\r\nmy beloved mother was no less pretentious than “Frederick Augustus\r\nWashington Bailey.” I had, however, before leaving Maryland, dispensed\r\nwith the _Augustus Washington_, and retained the name _Frederick\r\nBailey_. Between Baltimore and New Bedford, however, I had several\r\ndifferent names, the better to avoid being overhauled by the hunters,\r\nwhich I had good reason to believe would be put on my track. Among\r\nhonest men an honest man may well be content with one name, and to\r\nacknowledge it at all times and in all places; but toward fugitives,\r\nAmericans are not honest. When I arrived at New Bedford, my name was\r\nJohnson; and finding that the Johnson family in New Bedford were\r\nalready quite numerous—sufficiently so to produce some confusion in\r\nattempts to distinguish one from another—there was the more reason for\r\nmaking another change in my name. In fact, “Johnson” had been assumed\r\nby nearly every slave who had arrived in New Bedford from Maryland, and\r\nthis, much to the annoyance of the original “Johnsons” (of whom there\r\nwere many) in that place. Mine host, unwilling to have another of his\r\nown name added to the community in this unauthorized way, after I spent\r\na night and a day at his house, gave me my present name. He had been\r\nreading the “Lady of the Lake,” and was pleased to regard me as a\r\nsuitable person to wear this, one of Scotland’s many famous names.\r\nConsidering the noble hospitality and manly character of Nathan\r\nJohnson, I have felt that he, better than I, illustrated the virtues of\r\nthe great Scottish chief. Sure I am, that had any slave-catcher entered\r\nhis domicile, with a view to molest any one of his household, he would\r\nhave shown himself like him of the “stalwart hand.”\r\n\r\nThe reader will be amused at my ignorance, when I tell the notions I\r\nhad of the state of northern wealth, enterprise, and civilization. Of\r\nwealth and refinement, I supposed the north had none. My _Columbian\r\nOrator_, which was almost my only book, had not done much to enlighten\r\nme concerning northern society. The impressions I had received were all\r\nwide of the truth. New Bedford, especially, took me by surprise, in the\r\nsolid wealth and grandeur there exhibited. I had formed my notions\r\nrespecting the social condition of the free states, by what I had seen\r\nand known of free, white, non-slaveholding people in the slave states.\r\nRegarding slavery as the basis of wealth, I fancied that no people\r\ncould become very wealthy without slavery. A free white man, holding no\r\nslaves, in the country, I had known to be the most ignorant and\r\npoverty-stricken of men, and the laughing stock even of slaves\r\nthemselves—called generally by them, in derision, _“poor white trash_.”\r\nLike the non-slaveholders at the south, in holding no slaves, I suppose\r\nthe northern people like them, also, in poverty and degradation. Judge,\r\nthen, of my amazement and joy, when I found—as I did find—the very\r\nlaboring population of New Bedford living in better houses, more\r\nelegantly furnished—surrounded by more comfort and refinement—than a\r\nmajority of the slaveholders on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. There\r\nwas my friend, Mr. Johnson, himself a colored man (who at the south\r\nwould have been regarded as a proper marketable commodity), who lived\r\nin a better house—dined at a richer board—was the owner of more\r\nbooks—the reader of more newspapers—was more conversant with the\r\npolitical and social condition of this nation and the world—than\r\nnine-tenths of all the slaveholders of Talbot county, Maryland. Yet Mr.\r\nJohnson was a working man, and his hands were hardened by honest toil.\r\nHere, then, was something for observation and study. Whence the\r\ndifference? The explanation was soon furnished, in the superiority of\r\nmind over simple brute force. Many pages might be given to the\r\ncontrast, and in explanation of its causes. But an incident or two will\r\nsuffice to show the reader as to how the mystery gradually vanished\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\nMy first afternoon, on reaching New Bedford, was spent in visiting the\r\nwharves and viewing the shipping. The sight of the broad brim and the\r\nplain, Quaker dress, which met me at every turn, greatly increased my\r\nsense of freedom and security. “I am among the Quakers,” thought I,\r\n“and am safe.” Lying at the wharves and riding in the stream, were\r\nfull-rigged ships of finest model, ready to start on whaling voyages.\r\nUpon the right and the left, I was walled in by large granite-fronted\r\nwarehouses, crowded with the good things of this world. On the wharves,\r\nI saw industry without bustle, labor without noise, and heavy toil\r\nwithout the whip. There was no loud singing, as in southern ports,\r\nwhere ships are loading or unloading—no loud cursing or swearing—but\r\neverything went on as smoothly as the works of a well adjusted machine.\r\nHow different was all this from the nosily fierce and clumsily absurd\r\nmanner of labor-life in Baltimore and St. Michael’s! One of the first\r\nincidents which illustrated the superior mental character of northern\r\nlabor over that of the south, was the manner of unloading a ship’s\r\ncargo of oil. In a southern port, twenty or thirty hands would have\r\nbeen employed to do what five or six did here, with the aid of a single\r\nox attached to the end of a fall. Main strength, unassisted by skill,\r\nis slavery’s method of labor. An old ox, worth eighty dollars, was\r\ndoing, in New Bedford, what would have required fifteen thousand\r\ndollars worth of human bones and muscles to have performed in a\r\nsouthern port. I found that everything was done here with a scrupulous\r\nregard to economy, both in regard to men and things, time and strength.\r\nThe maid servant, instead of spending at least a tenth part of her time\r\nin bringing and carrying water, as in Baltimore, had the pump at her\r\nelbow. The wood was dry, and snugly piled away for winter. Woodhouses,\r\nin-door pumps, sinks, drains, self-shutting gates, washing machines,\r\npounding barrels, were all new things, and told me that I was among a\r\nthoughtful and sensible people. To the ship-repairing dock I went, and\r\nsaw the same wise prudence. The carpenters struck where they aimed, and\r\nthe calkers wasted no blows in idle flourishes of the mallet. I learned\r\nthat men went from New Bedford to Baltimore, and bought old ships, and\r\nbrought them here to repair, and made them better and more valuable\r\nthan they ever were before. Men talked here of going whaling on a four\r\n_years’_ voyage with more coolness than sailors where I came from\r\ntalked of going a four _months’_ voyage.\r\n\r\nI now find that I could have landed in no part of the United States,\r\nwhere I should have found a more striking and gratifying contrast to\r\nthe condition of the free people of color in Baltimore, than I found\r\nhere in New Bedford. No colored man is really free in a slaveholding\r\nstate. He wears the badge of bondage while nominally free, and is often\r\nsubjected to hardships to which the slave is a stranger; but here in\r\nNew Bedford, it was my good fortune to see a pretty near approach to\r\nfreedom on the part of the colored people. I was taken all aback when\r\nMr. Johnson—who lost no time in making me acquainted with the fact—told\r\nme that there was nothing in the constitution of Massachusetts to\r\nprevent a colored man from holding any office in the state. There, in\r\nNew Bedford, the black man’s children—although anti-slavery was then\r\nfar from popular—went to school side by side with the white children,\r\nand apparently without objection from any quarter. To make me at home,\r\nMr. Johnson assured me that no slaveholder could take a slave from New\r\nBedford; that there were men there who would lay down their lives,\r\nbefore such an outrage could be perpetrated. The colored people\r\nthemselves were of the best metal, and would fight for liberty to the\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nSoon after my arrival in New Bedford, I was told the following story,\r\nwhich was said to illustrate the spirit of the colored people in that\r\ngoodly town: A colored man and a fugitive slave happened to have a\r\nlittle quarrel, and the former was heard to threaten the latter with\r\ninforming his master of his whereabouts. As soon as this threat became\r\nknown, a notice was read from the desk of what was then the only\r\ncolored church in the place, stating that business of importance was to\r\nbe then and there transacted. Special measures had been taken to secure\r\nthe attendance of the would-be Judas, and had proved successful.\r\nAccordingly, at the hour appointed, the people came, and the betrayer\r\nalso. All the usual formalities of public meetings were scrupulously\r\ngone through, even to the offering prayer for Divine direction in the\r\nduties of the occasion. The president himself performed this part of\r\nthe ceremony, and I was told that he was unusually fervent. Yet, at the\r\nclose of his prayer, the old man (one of the numerous family of\r\nJohnsons) rose from his knees, deliberately surveyed his audience, and\r\nthen said, in a tone of solemn resolution, _“Well, friends, we have got\r\nhim here, and I would now recommend that you young men should just take\r\nhim outside the door and kill him.”_ With this, a large body of the\r\ncongregation, who well understood the business they had come there to\r\ntransact, made a rush at the villain, and doubtless would have killed\r\nhim, had he not availed himself of an open sash, and made good his\r\nescape. He has never shown his head in New Bedford since that time.\r\nThis little incident is perfectly characteristic of the spirit of the\r\ncolored people in New Bedford. A slave could not be taken from that\r\ntown seventeen years ago, any more than he could be so taken away now.\r\nThe reason is, that the colored people in that city are educated up to\r\nthe point of fighting for their freedom, as well as speaking for it.\r\n\r\nOnce assured of my safety in New Bedford, I put on the habiliments of a\r\ncommon laborer, and went on the wharf in search of work. I had no\r\nnotion of living on the honest and generous sympathy of my colored\r\nbrother, Johnson, or that of the abolitionists. My cry was like that of\r\nHood’s laborer, “Oh! only give me work.” Happily for me, I was not long\r\nin searching. I found employment, the third day after my arrival in New\r\nBedford, in stowing a sloop with a load of oil for the New York market.\r\nIt was new, hard, and dirty work, even for a calker, but I went at it\r\nwith a glad heart and a willing hand. I was now my own master—a\r\ntremendous fact—and the rapturous excitement with which I seized the\r\njob, may not easily be understood, except by some one with an\r\nexperience like mine. The thoughts—“I can work! I can work for a\r\nliving; I am not afraid of work; I have no Master Hugh to rob me of my\r\nearnings”—placed me in a state of independence, beyond seeking\r\nfriendship or support of any man. That day’s work I considered the real\r\nstarting point of something like a new existence. Having finished this\r\njob and got my pay for the same, I went next in pursuit of a job at\r\ncalking. It so happened that Mr. Rodney French, late mayor of the city\r\nof New Bedford, had a ship fitting out for sea, and to which there was\r\na large job of calking and coppering to be done. I applied to that\r\nnoblehearted man for employment, and he promptly told me to go to work;\r\nbut going on the float-stage for the purpose, I was informed that every\r\nwhite man would leave the ship if I struck a blow upon her. “Well,\r\nwell,” thought I, “this is a hardship, but yet not a very serious one\r\nfor me.” The difference between the wages of a calker and that of a\r\ncommon day laborer, was an hundred per cent in favor of the former; but\r\nthen I was free, and free to work, though not at my trade. I now\r\nprepared myself to do anything which came to hand in the way of turning\r\nan honest penny; sawed wood—dug cellars—shoveled coal—swept chimneys\r\nwith Uncle Lucas Debuty—rolled oil casks on the wharves—helped to load\r\nand unload vessels—worked in Ricketson’s candle works—in Richmond’s\r\nbrass foundery, and elsewhere; and thus supported myself and family for\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nThe first winter was unusually severe, in consequence of the high\r\nprices of food; but even during that winter we probably suffered less\r\nthan many who had been free all their lives. During the hardest of the\r\nwinter, I hired out for nine dolars(sic) a month; and out of this\r\nrented two rooms for nine dollars per quarter, and supplied my wife—who\r\nwas unable to work—with food and some necessary articles of furniture.\r\nWe were closely pinched to bring our wants within our means; but the\r\njail stood over the way, and I had a wholesome dread of the\r\nconsequences of running in debt. This winter past, and I was up with\r\nthe times—got plenty of work—got well paid for it—and felt that I had\r\nnot done a foolish thing to leave Master Hugh and Master Thomas. I was\r\nnow living in a new world, and was wide awake to its advantages. I\r\nearly began to attend the meetings of the colored people of New\r\nBedford, and to take part in them. I was somewhat amazed to see colored\r\nmen drawing up resolutions and offering them for consideration. Several\r\ncolored young men of New Bedford, at that period, gave promise of great\r\nusefulness. They were educated, and possessed what seemed to me, at the\r\ntime, very superior talents. Some of them have been cut down by death,\r\nand others have removed to different parts of the world, and some\r\nremain there now, and justify, in their present activities, my early\r\nimpressions of them.\r\n\r\nAmong my first concerns on reaching New Bedford, was to become united\r\nwith the church, for I had never given up, in reality, my religious\r\nfaith. I had become lukewarm and in a backslidden state, but I was\r\nstill convinced that it was my duty to join the Methodist church. I was\r\nnot then aware of the powerful influence of that religious body in\r\nfavor of the enslavement of my race, nor did I see how the northern\r\nchurches could be responsible for the conduct of southern churches;\r\nneither did I fully understand how it could be my duty to remain\r\nseparate from the church, because bad men were connected with it. The\r\nslaveholding church, with its Coveys, Weedens, Aulds, and Hopkins, I\r\ncould see through at once, but I could not see how Elm Street church,\r\nin New Bedford, could be regarded as sanctioning the Christianity of\r\nthese characters in the church at St. Michael’s. I therefore resolved\r\nto join the Methodist church in New Bedford, and to enjoy the spiritual\r\nadvantage of public worship. The minister of the Elm Street Methodist\r\nchurch, was the Rev. Mr. Bonney; and although I was not allowed a seat\r\nin the body of the house, and was proscribed on account of my color,\r\nregarding this proscription simply as an accommodation of the\r\nuncoverted congregation who had not yet been won to Christ and his\r\nbrotherhood, I was willing thus to be proscribed, lest sinners should\r\nbe driven away form the saving power of the gospel. Once converted, I\r\nthought they would be sure to treat me as a man and a brother.\r\n“Surely,” thought I, “these Christian people have none of this feeling\r\nagainst color. They, at least, have renounced this unholy feeling.”\r\nJudge, then, dear reader, of my astonishment and mortification, when I\r\nfound, as soon I did find, all my charitable assumptions at fault.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity was soon afforded me for ascertaining the exact position\r\nof Elm Street church on that subject. I had a chance of seeing the\r\nreligious part of the congregation by themselves; and although they\r\ndisowned, in effect, their black brothers and sisters, before the\r\nworld, I did think that where none but the saints were assembled, and\r\nno offense could be given to the wicked, and the gospel could not be\r\n“blamed,” they would certainly recognize us as children of the same\r\nFather, and heirs of the same salvation, on equal terms with\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe occasion to which I refer, was the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper,\r\nthat most sacred and most solemn of all the ordinances of the Christian\r\nchurch. Mr. Bonney had preached a very solemn and searching discourse,\r\nwhich really proved him to be acquainted with the inmost secerts(sic)\r\nof the human heart. At the close of his discourse, the congregation was\r\ndismissed, and the church remained to partake of the sacrament. I\r\nremained to see, as I thought, this holy sacrament celebrated in the\r\nspirit of its great Founder.\r\n\r\nThere were only about a half dozen colored members attached to the Elm\r\nStreet church, at this time. After the congregation was dismissed,\r\nthese descended from the gallery, and took a seat against the wall most\r\ndistant from the altar. Brother Bonney was very animated, and sung very\r\nsweetly, “Salvation ‘tis a joyful sound,” and soon began to administer\r\nthe sacrament. I was anxious to observe the bearing of the colored\r\nmembers, and the result was most humiliating. During the whole\r\nceremony, they looked like sheep without a shepherd. The white members\r\nwent forward to the altar by the bench full; and when it was evident\r\nthat all the whites had been served with the bread and wine, Brother\r\nBonney—pious Brother Bonney—after a long pause, as if inquiring whether\r\nall the whites members had been served, and fully assuring himself on\r\nthat important point, then raised his voice to an unnatural pitch, and\r\nlooking to the corner where his black sheep seemed penned, beckoned\r\nwith his hand, exclaiming, “Come forward, colored friends! come\r\nforward! You, too, have an interest in the blood of Christ. God is no\r\nrespecter of persons. Come forward, and take this holy sacrament to\r\nyour comfort.” The colored members poor, slavish souls went forward, as\r\ninvited. I went out, and have never been in that church since, although\r\nI honestly went there with a view to joining that body. I found it\r\nimpossible to respect the religious profession of any who were under\r\nthe dominion of this wicked prejudice, and I could not, therefore, feel\r\nthat in joining them, I was joining a Christian church, at all. I tried\r\nother churches in New Bedford, with the same result, and finally, I\r\nattached myself to a small body of colored Methodists, known as the\r\nZion Methodists. Favored with the affection and confidence of the\r\nmembers of this humble communion, I was soon made a classleader and a\r\nlocal preacher among them. Many seasons of peace and joy I experienced\r\namong them, the remembrance of which is still precious, although I\r\ncould not see it to be my duty to remain with that body, when I found\r\nthat it consented to the same spirit which held my brethren in chains.\r\n\r\nIn four or five months after reaching New Bedford, there came a young\r\nman to me, with a copy of the _Liberator_, the paper edited by WILLIAM\r\nLLOYD GARRISON, and published by ISAAC KNAPP, and asked me to subscribe\r\nfor it. I told him I had but just escaped from slavery, and was of\r\ncourse very poor, and remarked further, that I was unable to pay for it\r\nthen; the agent, however, very willingly took me as a subscriber, and\r\nappeared to be much pleased with securing my name to his list. From\r\nthis time I was brought in contact with the mind of William Lloyd\r\nGarrison. His paper took its place with me next to the bible.\r\n\r\nThe _Liberator_ was a paper after my own heart. It detested slavery\r\nexposed hypocrisy and wickedness in high places—made no truce with the\r\ntraffickers in the bodies and souls of men; it preached human\r\nbrotherhood, denounced oppression, and, with all the solemnity of God’s\r\nword, demanded the complete emancipation of my race. I not only liked—I\r\n_loved_ this paper, and its editor. He seemed a match for all the\r\noponents(sic) of emancipation, whether they spoke in the name of the\r\nlaw, or the gospel. His words were few, full of holy fire, and straight\r\nto the point. Learning to love him, through his paper, I was prepared\r\nto be pleased with his presence. Something of a hero worshiper, by\r\nnature, here was one, on first sight, to excite my love and reverence.\r\n\r\nSeventeen years ago, few men possessed a more heavenly countenance than\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, and few men evinced a more genuine or a more\r\nexalted piety. The bible was his text book—held sacred, as the word of\r\nthe Eternal Father—sinless perfection—complete submission to insults\r\nand injuries—literal obedience to the injunction, if smitten on one\r\nside to turn the other also. Not only was Sunday a Sabbath, but all\r\ndays were Sabbaths, and to be kept holy. All sectarism false and\r\nmischievous—the regenerated, throughout the world, members of one body,\r\nand the HEAD Christ Jesus. Prejudice against color was rebellion\r\nagainst God. Of all men beneath the sky, the slaves, because most\r\nneglected and despised, were nearest and dearest to his great heart.\r\nThose ministers who defended slavery from the bible, were of their\r\n“father the devil”; and those churches which fellowshiped slaveholders\r\nas Christians, were synagogues of Satan, and our nation was a nation of\r\nliars. Never loud or noisy—calm and serene as a summer sky, and as\r\npure. “You are the man, the Moses, raised up by God, to deliver his\r\nmodern Israel from bondage,” was the spontaneous feeling of my heart,\r\nas I sat away back in the hall and listened to his mighty words; mighty\r\nin truth—mighty in their simple earnestness.\r\n\r\nI had not long been a reader of the _Liberator_, and listener to its\r\neditor, before I got a clear apprehension of the principles of the\r\nanti-slavery movement. I had already the spirit of the movement, and\r\nonly needed to understand its principles and measures. These I got from\r\nthe _Liberator_, and from those who believed in that paper. My\r\nacquaintance with the movement increased my hope for the ultimate\r\nfreedom of my race, and I united with it from a sense of delight, as\r\nwell as duty.\r\n\r\nEvery week the _Liberator_ came, and every week I made myself master of\r\nits contents. All the anti-slavery meetings held in New Bedford I\r\npromptly attended, my heart burning at every true utterance against the\r\nslave system, and every rebuke of its friends and supporters. Thus\r\npassed the first three years of my residence in New Bedford. I had not\r\nthen dreamed of the posibility(sic) of my becoming a public advocate of\r\nthe cause so deeply imbedded in my heart. It was enough for me to\r\nlisten—to receive and applaud the great words of others, and only\r\nwhisper in private, among the white laborers on the wharves, and\r\nelsewhere, the truths which burned in my breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. _Introduced to the Abolitionists_\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SPEECH AT NANTUCKET—MUCH SENSATION—EXTRAORDINARY SPEECH OF MR.\r\nGARRISON—AUTHOR BECOMES A PUBLIC LECTURER—FOURTEEN YEARS\r\nEXPERIENCE—YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM—A BRAND NEW FACT—MATTER OF MY AUTHOR’S\r\nSPEECH—COULD NOT FOLLOW THE PROGRAMME—FUGITIVE SLAVESHIP DOUBTED—TO\r\nSETTLE ALL DOUBT I WRITE MY EXPERIENCE OF SLAVERY—DANGER OF RECAPTURE\r\nINCREASED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1841, a grand anti-slavery convention was held in\r\nNantucket, under the auspices of Mr. Garrison and his friends. Until\r\nnow, I had taken no holiday since my escape from slavery. Having worked\r\nvery hard that spring and summer, in Richmond’s brass\r\nfoundery—sometimes working all night as well as all day—and needing a\r\nday or two of rest, I attended this convention, never supposing that I\r\nshould take part in the proceedings. Indeed, I was not aware that any\r\none connected with the convention even so much as knew my name. I was,\r\nhowever, quite mistaken. Mr. William C. Coffin, a prominent\r\nabolitionst(sic) in those days of trial, had heard me speaking to my\r\ncolored friends, in the little school house on Second street, New\r\nBedford, where we worshiped. He sought me out in the crowd, and invited\r\nme to say a few words to the convention. Thus sought out, and thus\r\ninvited, I was induced to speak out the feelings inspired by the\r\noccasion, and the fresh recollection of the scenes through which I had\r\npassed as a slave. My speech on this occasion is about the only one I\r\never made, of which I do not remember a single connected sentence. It\r\nwas with the utmost difficulty that I could stand erect, or that I\r\ncould command and articulate two words without hesitation and\r\nstammering. I trembled in every limb. I am not sure that my\r\nembarrassment was not the most effective part of my speech, if speech\r\nit could be called. At any rate, this is about the only part of my\r\nperformance that I now distinctly remember. But excited and convulsed\r\nas I was, the audience, though remarkably quiet before, became as much\r\nexcited as myself. Mr. Garrison followed me, taking me as his text; and\r\nnow, whether I had made an eloquent speech in behalf of freedom or not,\r\nhis was one never to be forgotten by those who heard it. Those who had\r\nheard Mr. Garrison oftenest, and had known him longest, were\r\nastonished. It was an effort of unequaled power, sweeping down, like a\r\nvery tornado, every opposing barrier, whether of sentiment or opinion.\r\nFor a moment, he possessed that almost fabulous inspiration, often\r\nreferred to but seldom attained, in which a public meeting is\r\ntransformed, as it were, into a single individuality—the orator\r\nwielding a thousand heads and hearts at once, and by the simple majesty\r\nof his all controlling thought, converting his hearers into the express\r\nimage of his own soul. That night there were at least one thousand\r\nGarrisonians in Nantucket! A(sic) the close of this great meeting, I\r\nwas duly waited on by Mr. John A. Collins—then the general agent of the\r\nMassachusetts anti-slavery society—and urgently solicited by him to\r\nbecome an agent of that society, and to publicly advocate its\r\nanti-slavery principles. I was reluctant to take the proffered\r\nposition. I had not been quite three years from slavery—was honestly\r\ndistrustful of my ability—wished to be excused; publicity exposed me to\r\ndiscovery and arrest by my master; and other objections came up, but\r\nMr. Collins was not to be put off, and I finally consented to go out\r\nfor three months, for I supposed that I should have got to the end of\r\nmy story and my usefulness, in that length of time.\r\n\r\nHere opened upon me a new life a life for which I had had no\r\npreparation. I was a “graduate from the peculiar institution,” Mr.\r\nCollins used to say, when introducing me, _“with my diploma written on\r\nmy back!”_ The three years of my freedom had been spent in the hard\r\nschool of adversity. My hands had been furnished by nature with\r\nsomething like a solid leather coating, and I had bravely marked out\r\nfor myself a life of rough labor, suited to the hardness of my hands,\r\nas a means of supporting myself and rearing my children.\r\n\r\nNow what shall I say of this fourteen years’ experience as a public\r\nadvocate of the cause of my enslaved brothers and sisters? The time is\r\nbut as a speck, yet large enough to justify a pause for\r\nretrospection—and a pause it must only be.\r\n\r\nYoung, ardent, and hopeful, I entered upon this new life in the full\r\ngush of unsuspecting enthusiasm. The cause was good; the men engaged in\r\nit were good; the means to attain its triumph, good; Heaven’s blessing\r\nmust attend all, and freedom must soon be given to the pining millions\r\nunder a ruthless bondage. My whole heart went with the holy cause, and\r\nmy most fervent prayer to the Almighty Disposer of the hearts of men,\r\nwere continually offered for its early triumph. “Who or what,” thought\r\nI, “can withstand a cause so good, so holy, so indescribably glorious.\r\nThe God of Israel is with us. The might of the Eternal is on our side.\r\nNow let but the truth be spoken, and a nation will start forth at the\r\nsound!” In this enthusiastic spirit, I dropped into the ranks of\r\nfreedom’s friends, and went forth to the battle. For a time I was made\r\nto forget that my skin was dark and my hair crisped. For a time I\r\nregretted that I could not have shared the hardships and dangers\r\nendured by the earlier workers for the slave’s release. I soon,\r\nhowever, found that my enthusiasm had been extravagant; that hardships\r\nand dangers were not yet passed; and that the life now before me, had\r\nshadows as well as sunbeams.\r\n\r\nAmong the first duties assigned me, on entering the ranks, was to\r\ntravel, in company with Mr. George Foster, to secure subscribers to the\r\n_Anti-slavery Standard_ and the _Liberator_. With him I traveled and\r\nlectured through the eastern counties of Massachusetts. Much interest\r\nwas awakened—large meetings assembled. Many came, no doubt, from\r\ncuriosity to hear what a Negro could say in his own cause. I was\r\ngenerally introduced as a _“chattel”—_a_“thing”_—a piece of southern\r\n_“property”_—the chairman assuring the audience that _it_ could speak.\r\nFugitive slaves, at that time, were not so plentiful as now; and as a\r\nfugitive slave lecturer, I had the advantage of being a _“brand new\r\nfact”_—the first one out. Up to that time, a colored man was deemed a\r\nfool who confessed himself a runaway slave, not only because of the\r\ndanger to which he exposed himself of being retaken, but because it was\r\na confession of a very _low_ origin! Some of my colored friends in New\r\nBedford thought very badly of my wisdom for thus exposing and degrading\r\nmyself. The only precaution I took, at the beginning, to prevent Master\r\nThomas from knowing where I was, and what I was about, was the\r\nwithholding my former name, my master’s name, and the name of the state\r\nand county from which I came. During the first three or four months, my\r\nspeeches were almost exclusively made up of narrations of my own\r\npersonal experience as a slave. “Let us have the facts,” said the\r\npeople. So also said Friend George Foster, who always wished to pin me\r\ndown to my simple narrative. “Give us the facts,” said Collins, “we\r\nwill take care of the philosophy.” Just here arose some embarrassment.\r\nIt was impossible for me to repeat the same old story month after\r\nmonth, and to keep up my interest in it. It was new to the people, it\r\nis true, but it was an old story to me; and to go through with it night\r\nafter night, was a task altogether too mechanical for my nature. “Tell\r\nyour story, Frederick,” would whisper my then revered friend, William\r\nLloyd Garrison, as I stepped upon the platform. I could not always\r\nobey, for I was now reading and thinking. New views of the subject were\r\npresented to my mind. It did not entirely satisfy me to _narrate_\r\nwrongs; I felt like _denouncing_ them. I could not always curb my moral\r\nindignation for the perpetrators of slaveholding villainy, long enough\r\nfor a circumstantial statement of the facts which I felt almost\r\neverybody must know. Besides, I was growing, and needed room. “People\r\nwon’t believe you ever was a slave, Frederick, if you keep on this\r\nway,” said Friend Foster. “Be yourself,” said Collins, “and tell your\r\nstory.” It was said to me, “Better have a _little_ of the plantation\r\nmanner of speech than not; ‘tis not best that you seem too learned.”\r\nThese excellent friends were actuated by the best of motives, and were\r\nnot altogether wrong in their advice; and still I must speak just the\r\nword that seemed to _me_ the word to be spoken _by_ me.\r\n\r\nAt last the apprehended trouble came. People doubted if I had ever been\r\na slave. They said I did not talk like a slave, look like a slave, nor\r\nact like a slave, and that they believed I had never been south of\r\nMason and Dixon’s line. “He don’t tell us where he came from—what his\r\nmaster’s name was—how he got away—nor the story of his experience.\r\nBesides, he is educated, and is, in this, a contradiction of all the\r\nfacts we have concerning the ignorance of the slaves.” Thus, I was in a\r\npretty fair way to be denounced as an impostor. The committee of the\r\nMassachusetts anti-slavery society knew all the facts in my case, and\r\nagreed with me in the prudence of keeping them private. They,\r\ntherefore, never doubted my being a genuine fugitive; but going down\r\nthe aisles of the churches in which I spoke, and hearing the free\r\nspoken Yankees saying, repeatedly, _“He’s never been a slave, I’ll\r\nwarrant ye_,” I resolved to dispel all doubt, at no distant day, by\r\nsuch a revelation of facts as could not be made by any other than a\r\ngenuine fugitive.\r\n\r\nIn a little less than four years, therefore, after becoming a public\r\nlecturer, I was induced to write out the leading facts connected with\r\nmy experience in slavery, giving names of persons, places, and\r\ndates—thus putting it in the power of any who doubted, to ascertain the\r\ntruth or falsehood of my story of being a fugitive slave. This\r\nstatement soon became known in Maryland, and I had reason to believe\r\nthat an effort would be made to recapture me.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that any open attempt to secure me as a slave could\r\nhave succeeded, further than the obtainment, by my master, of the money\r\nvalue of my bones and sinews. Fortunately for me, in the four years of\r\nmy labors in the abolition cause, I had gained many friends, who would\r\nhave suffered themselves to be taxed to almost any extent to save me\r\nfrom slavery. It was felt that I had committed the double offense of\r\nrunning away, and exposing the secrets and crimes of slavery and\r\nslaveholders. There was a double motive for seeking my\r\nreenslavement—avarice and vengeance; and while, as I have said, there\r\nwas little probability of successful recapture, if attempted openly, I\r\nwas constantly in danger of being spirited away, at a moment when my\r\nfriends could render me no assistance. In traveling about from place to\r\nplace—often alone I was much exposed to this sort of attack. Any one\r\ncherishing the design to betray me, could easily do so, by simply\r\ntracing my whereabouts through the anti-slavery journals, for my\r\nmeetings and movements were promptly made known in advance. My true\r\nfriends, Mr. Garrison and Mr. Phillips, had no faith in the power of\r\nMassachusetts to protect me in my right to liberty. Public sentiment\r\nand the law, in their opinion, would hand me over to the tormentors.\r\nMr. Phillips, especially, considered me in danger, and said, when I\r\nshowed him the manuscript of my story, if in my place, he would throw\r\nit into the fire. Thus, the reader will observe, the settling of one\r\ndifficulty only opened the way for another; and that though I had\r\nreached a free state, and had attained position for public usefulness,\r\nI ws(sic) still tormented with the liability of losing my liberty. How\r\nthis liability was dispelled, will be related, with other incidents, in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. _Twenty-One Months in Great Britain_\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD ARISING OUT OF UNPROPITIOUS EVENTS—DENIED CABIN\r\nPASSAGE—PROSCRIPTION TURNED TO GOOD ACCOUNT—THE HUTCHINSON FAMILY—THE\r\nMOB ON BOARD THE “CAMBRIA”—HAPPY INTRODUCTION TO THE BRITISH\r\nPUBLIC—LETTER ADDRESSED TO WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON—TIME AND LABORS WHILE\r\nABROAD—FREEDOM PURCHASED—MRS. HENRY RICHARDSON—FREE\r\nPAPERS—ABOLITIONISTS DISPLEASED WITH THE RANSOM—HOW MY ENERGIES WERE\r\nDIRECTED—RECEPTION SPEECH IN LONDON—CHARACTER OF THE SPEECH\r\nDEFENDED—CIRCUMSTANCES EXPLAINED—CAUSES CONTRIBUTING TO THE SUCCESS OF\r\nMY MISSION—FREE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND—TESTIMONIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe allotments of Providence, when coupled with trouble and anxiety,\r\noften conceal from finite vision the wisdom and goodness in which they\r\nare sent; and, frequently, what seemed a harsh and invidious\r\ndispensation, is converted by after experience into a happy and\r\nbeneficial arrangement. Thus, the painful liability to be returned\r\nagain to slavery, which haunted me by day, and troubled my dreams by\r\nnight, proved to be a necessary step in the path of knowledge and\r\nusefulness. The writing of my pamphlet, in the spring of 1845,\r\nendangered my liberty, and led me to seek a refuge from republican\r\nslavery in monarchical England. A rude, uncultivated fugitive slave was\r\ndriven, by stern necessity, to that country to which young American\r\ngentlemen go to increase their stock of knowledge, to seek pleasure, to\r\nhave their rough, democratic manners softened by contact with English\r\naristocratic refinement. On applying for a passage to England, on board\r\nthe “Cambria”, of the Cunard line, my friend, James N. Buffum, of Lynn,\r\nMassachusetts, was informed that I could not be received on board as a\r\ncabin passenger. American prejudice against color triumphed over\r\nBritish liberality and civilization, and erected a color test and\r\ncondition for crossing the sea in the cabin of a British vessel. The\r\ninsult was keenly felt by my white friends, but to me, it was common,\r\nexpected, and therefore, a thing of no great consequence, whether I\r\nwent in the cabin or in the steerage. Moreover, I felt that if I could\r\nnot go into the first cabin, first-cabin passengers could come into the\r\nsecond cabin, and the result justified my anticipations to the fullest\r\nextent. Indeed, I soon found myself an object of more general interest\r\nthan I wished to be; and so far from being degraded by being placed in\r\nthe second cabin, that part of the ship became the scene of as much\r\npleasure and refinement, during the voyage, as the cabin itself. The\r\nHutchinson Family, celebrated vocalists—fellow-passengers—often came to\r\nmy rude forecastle deck, and sung their sweetest songs, enlivening the\r\nplace with eloquent music, as well as spirited conversation, during the\r\nvoyage. In two days after leaving Boston, one part of the ship was\r\nabout as free to me as another. My fellow-passengers not only visited\r\nme, but invited me to visit them, on the saloon deck. My visits there,\r\nhowever, were but seldom. I preferred to live within my privileges, and\r\nkeep upon my own premises. I found this quite as much in accordance\r\nwith good policy, as with my own feelings. The effect was, that with\r\nthe majority of the passengers, all color distinctions were flung to\r\nthe winds, and I found myself treated with every mark of respect, from\r\nthe beginning to the end of the voyage, except in a single instance;\r\nand in that, I came near being mobbed, for complying with an invitation\r\ngiven me by the passengers, and the captain of the “Cambria,” to\r\ndeliver a lecture on slavery. Our New Orleans and Georgia passengers\r\nwere pleased to regard my lecture as an insult offered to them, and\r\nswore I should not speak. They went so far as to threaten to throw me\r\noverboard, and but for the firmness of Captain Judkins, probably would\r\nhave (under the inspiration of _slavery_ and _brandy_) attempted to put\r\ntheir threats into execution. I have no space to describe this scene,\r\nalthough its tragic and comic peculiarities are well worth describing.\r\nAn end was put to the _melee_, by the captain’s calling the ship’s\r\ncompany to put the salt water mobocrats in irons. At this determined\r\norder, the gentlemen of the lash scampered, and for the rest of the\r\nvoyage conducted themselves very decorously.\r\n\r\nThis incident of the voyage, in two days after landing at Liverpool,\r\nbrought me at once before the British public, and that by no act of my\r\nown. The gentlemen so promptly snubbed in their meditated violence,\r\nflew to the press to justify their conduct, and to denounce me as a\r\nworthless and insolent Negro. This course was even less wise than the\r\nconduct it was intended to sustain; for, besides awakening something\r\nlike a national interest in me, and securing me an audience, it brought\r\nout counter statements, and threw the blame upon themselves, which they\r\nhad sought to fasten upon me and the gallant captain of the ship.\r\n\r\nSome notion may be formed of the difference in my feelings and\r\ncircumstances, while abroad, from the following extract from one of a\r\nseries of letters addressed by me to Mr. Garrison, and published in the\r\n_Liberator_. It was written on the first day of January, 1846:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND GARRISON: Up to this time, I have given no direct\r\nexpression of the views, feelings, and opinions which I have formed,\r\nrespecting the character and condition of the people of this land. I\r\nhave refrained thus, purposely. I wish to speak advisedly, and in order\r\nto do this, I have waited till, I trust, experience has brought my\r\nopinions to an intelligent maturity. I have been thus careful, not\r\nbecause I think what I say will have much effect in shaping the\r\nopinions of the world, but because whatever of influence I may possess,\r\nwhether little or much, I wish it to go in the right direction, and\r\naccording to truth. I hardly need say that, in speaking of Ireland, I\r\nshall be influenced by no prejudices in favor of America. I think my\r\ncircumstances all forbid that. I have no end to serve, no creed to\r\nuphold, no government to defend; and as to nation, I belong to none. I\r\nhave no protection at home, or resting-place abroad. The land of my\r\nbirth welcomes me to her shores only as a slave, and spurns with\r\ncontempt the idea of treating me differently; so that I am an outcast\r\nfrom the society of my childhood, and an outlaw in the land of my\r\nbirth. “I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers\r\nwere.” That men should be patriotic, is to me perfectly natural; and as\r\na philosophical fact, I am able to give it an _intellectual_\r\nrecognition. But no further can I go. If ever I had any patriotism, or\r\nany capacity for the feeling, it was whipped out of me long since, by\r\nthe lash of the American soul-drivers.\r\n\r\nIn thinking of America, I sometimes find myself admiring her bright\r\nblue sky, her grand old woods, her fertile fields, her beautiful\r\nrivers, her mighty lakes, and star-crowned mountains. But my rapture is\r\nsoon checked, my joy is soon turned to mourning. When I remember that\r\nall is cursed with the infernal spirit of slaveholding, robbery, and\r\nwrong; when I remember that with the waters of her noblest rivers, the\r\ntears of my brethren are borne to the ocean, disregarded and forgotten,\r\nand that her most fertile fields drink daily of the warm blood of my\r\noutraged sisters; I am filled with unutterable loathing, and led to\r\nreproach myself that anything could fall from my lips in praise of such\r\na land. America will not allow her children to love her. She seems bent\r\non compelling those who would be her warmest friends, to be her worst\r\nenemies. May God give her repentance, before it is too late, is the\r\nardent prayer of my heart. I will continue to pray, labor, and wait,\r\nbelieving that she cannot always be insensible to the dictates of\r\njustice, or deaf to the voice of humanity.\r\n\r\nMy opportunities for learning the character and condition of the people\r\nof this land have been very great. I have traveled almost from the Hill\r\nof Howth to the Giant’s Causeway, and from the Giant’s Causway, to Cape\r\nClear. During these travels, I have met with much in the chara@@ and\r\ncondition of the people to approve, and much to condemn; much that\r\n@@thrilled me with pleasure, and very much that has filled me with\r\npain. I @@ @@t, in this letter, attempt to give any description of\r\nthose scenes which have given me pain. This I will do hereafter. I have\r\nenough, and more than your subscribers will be disposed to read at one\r\ntime, of the bright side of the picture. I can truly say, I have spent\r\nsome of the happiest moments of my life since landing in this country.\r\nI seem to have undergone a transformation. I live a new life. The warm\r\nand generous cooperation extended to me by the friends of my despised\r\nrace; the prompt and liberal manner with which the press has rendered\r\nme its aid; the glorious enthusiasm with which thousands have flocked\r\nto hear the cruel wrongs of my down-trodden and long-enslaved\r\nfellow-countrymen portrayed; the deep sympathy for the slave, and the\r\nstrong abhorrence of the slaveholder, everywhere evinced; the\r\ncordiality with which members and ministers of various religious\r\nbodies, and of various shades of religious opinion, have embraced me,\r\nand lent me their aid; the kind of hospitality constantly proffered to\r\nme by persons of the highest rank in society; the spirit of freedom\r\nthat seems to animate all with whom I come in contact, and the entire\r\nabsence of everything that looked like prejudice against me, on account\r\nof the color of my skin—contrasted so strongly with my long and bitter\r\nexperience in the United States, that I look with wonder and amazement\r\non the transition. In the southern part of the United States, I was a\r\nslave, thought of and spoken of as property; in the language of the\r\nLAW, “_held, taken, reputed, and adjudged to be a chattel in the hands\r\nof my owners and possessors, and their executors, administrators, and\r\nassigns, to all intents, constructions, and purposes whatsoever_.”\r\n(Brev. Digest, 224). In the northern states, a fugitive slave, liable\r\nto be hunted at any moment, like a felon, and to be hurled into the\r\nterrible jaws of slavery—doomed by an inveterate prejudice against\r\ncolor to insult and outrage on every hand (Massachusetts out of the\r\nquestion)—denied the privileges and courtesies common to others in the\r\nuse of the most humble means of conveyance—shut out from the cabins on\r\nsteamboats—refused admission to respectable hotels—caricatured,\r\nscorned, scoffed, mocked, and maltreated with impunity by any one (no\r\nmatter how black his heart), so he has a white skin. But now behold the\r\nchange! Eleven days and a half gone, and I have crossed three thousand\r\nmiles of the perilous deep. Instead of a democratic government, I am\r\nunder a monarchical government. Instead of the bright, blue sky of\r\nAmerica, I am covered with the soft, grey fog of the Emerald Isle. I\r\nbreathe, and lo! the chattel becomes a man. I gaze around in vain for\r\none who will question my equal humanity, claim me as his slave, or\r\noffer me an insult. I employ a cab—I am seated beside white people—I\r\nreach the hotel—I enter the same door—I am shown into the same parlor—I\r\ndine at the same table and no one is offended. No delicate nose grows\r\ndeformed in my presence. I find no difficulty here in obtaining\r\nadmission into any place of worship, instruction, or amusement, on\r\nequal terms with people as white as any I ever saw in the United\r\nStates. I meet nothing to remind me of my complexion. I find myself\r\nregarded and treated at every turn with the kindness and deference paid\r\nto white people. When I go to church, I am met by no upturned nose and\r\nscornful lip to tell me, “_We don’t allow niggers in here_!”\r\n\r\nI remember, about two years ago, there was in Boston, near the\r\nsouth-west corner of Boston Common, a menagerie. I had long desired to\r\nsee such a collection as I understood was being exhibited there. Never\r\nhaving had an opportunity while a slave, I resolved to seize this, my\r\nfirst, since my escape. I went, and as I approached the entrance to\r\ngain admission, I was met and told by the door-keeper, in a harsh and\r\ncontemptuous tone, “_We don’t allow niggers in here_.” I also remember\r\nattending a revival meeting in the Rev. Henry Jackson’s meeting-house,\r\nat New Bedford, and going up the broad aisle to find a seat, I was met\r\nby a good deacon, who told me, in a pious tone, “_We don’t allow\r\nniggers in here_!” Soon after my arrival in New Bedford, from the\r\nsouth, I had a strong desire to attend the Lyceum, but was told, “_They\r\ndon’t allow niggers in here_!” While passing from New York to Boston,\r\non the steamer Massachusetts, on the night of the 9th of December,\r\n1843, when chilled almost through with the cold, I went into the cabin\r\nto get a little warm. I was soon touched upon the shoulder, and told,\r\n“_We don’t allow niggers in here_!” On arriving in Boston, from an\r\nanti-slavery tour, hungry and tired, I went into an eating-house, near\r\nmy friend, Mr. Campbell’s to get some refreshments. I was met by a lad\r\nin a white apron, “_We don’t allow niggers in here_!” A week or two\r\nbefore leaving the United States, I had a meeting appointed at\r\nWeymouth, the home of that glorious band of true abolitionists, the\r\nWeston family, and others. On attempting to take a seat in the omnibus\r\nto that place, I was told by the driver (and I never shall forget his\r\nfiendish hate). “_I don’t allow niggers in here_!” Thank heaven for the\r\nrespite I now enjoy! I had been in Dublin but a few days, when a\r\ngentleman of great respectability kindly offered to conduct me through\r\nall the public buildings of that beautiful city; and a little\r\nafterward, I found myself dining with the lord mayor of Dublin. What a\r\npity there was not some American democratic Christian at the door of\r\nhis splendid mansion, to bark out at my approach, “_They don’t allow\r\nniggers in here_!” The truth is, the people here know nothing of the\r\nrepublican Negro hate prevalent in our glorious land. They measure and\r\nesteem men according to their moral and intellectual worth, and not\r\naccording to the color of their skin. Whatever may be said of the\r\naristocracies here, there is none based on the color of a man’s skin.\r\nThis species of aristocracy belongs preeminently to “the land of the\r\nfree, and the home of the brave.” I have never found it abroad, in any\r\nbut Americans. It sticks to them wherever they go. They find it almost\r\nas hard to get rid of, as to get rid of their skins.\r\n\r\nThe second day after my arrival at Liverpool, in company with my\r\nfriend, Buffum, and several other friends, I went to Eaton Hall, the\r\nresidence of the Marquis of Westminster, one of the most splendid\r\nbuildings in England. On approaching the door, I found several of our\r\nAmerican passengers, who came out with us in the “Cambria,” waiting for\r\nadmission, as but one party was allowed in the house at a time. We all\r\nhad to wait till the company within came out. And of all the faces,\r\nexpressive of chagrin, those of the Americans were preeminent. They\r\nlooked as sour as vinegar, and as bitter as gall, when they found I was\r\nto be admitted on equal terms with themselves. When the door was\r\nopened, I walked in, on an equal footing with my white fellow-citizens,\r\nand from all I could see, I had as much attention paid me by the\r\nservants that showed us through the house, as any with a paler skin. As\r\nI walked through the building, the statuary did not fall down, the\r\npictures did not leap from their places, the doors did not refuse to\r\nopen, and the servants did not say, “_We don’t allow niggers in here_!”\r\n\r\nA happy new-year to you, and all the friends of freedom.\r\n\r\nMy time and labors, while abroad were divided between England, Ireland,\r\nScotland, and Wales. Upon this experience alone, I might write a book\r\ntwice the size of this, _My Bondage and My Freedom_. I visited and\r\nlectured in nearly all the large towns and cities in the United\r\nKingdom, and enjoyed many favorable opportunities for observation and\r\ninformation. But books on England are abundant, and the public may,\r\ntherefore, dismiss any fear that I am meditating another infliction in\r\nthat line; though, in truth, I should like much to write a book on\r\nthose countries, if for nothing else, to make grateful mention of the\r\nmany dear friends, whose benevolent actions toward me are ineffaceably\r\nstamped upon my memory, and warmly treasured in my heart. To these\r\nfriends I owe my freedom in the United States. On their own motion,\r\nwithout any solicitation from me (Mrs. Henry Richardson, a clever lady,\r\nremarkable for her devotion to every good work, taking the lead), they\r\nraised a fund sufficient to purchase my freedom, and actually paid it\r\nover, and placed the papers 8 of my manumission in my hands, before\r\nthey would tolerate the idea of my returning to this, my native\r\ncountry. To this commercial transaction I owe my exemption from the\r\ndemocratic operation of the Fugitive Slave Bill of 1850. But for this,\r\nI might at any time become a victim of this most cruel and scandalous\r\nenactment, and be doomed to end my life, as I began it, a slave. The\r\nsum paid for my freedom was one hundred and fifty pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nSome of my uncompromising anti-slavery friends in this country failed\r\nto see the wisdom of this arrangement, and were not pleased that I\r\nconsented to it, even by my silence. They thought it a violation of\r\nanti-slavery principles—conceding a right of property in man—and a\r\nwasteful expenditure of money. On the other hand, viewing it simply in\r\nthe light of a ransom, or as money extorted by a robber, and my liberty\r\nof more value than one hundred and fifty pounds sterling, I could not\r\nsee either a violation of the laws of morality, or those of economy, in\r\nthe transaction.\r\n\r\nIt is true, I was not in the possession of my claimants, and could have\r\neasily remained in England, for the same friends who had so generously\r\npurchased my freedom, would have assisted me in establishing myself in\r\nthat country. To this, however, I could not consent. I felt that I had\r\na duty to perform—and that was, to labor and suffer with the oppressed\r\nin my native land. Considering, therefore, all the circumstances—the\r\nfugitive slave bill included—I think the very best thing was done in\r\nletting Master Hugh have the hundred and fifty pounds sterling, and\r\nleaving me free to return to my appropriate field of labor. Had I been\r\na private person, having no other relations or duties than those of a\r\npersonal and family nature, I should never have consented to the\r\npayment of so large a sum for the privilege of living securely under\r\nour glorious republican form of government. I could have remained in\r\nEngland, or have gone to some other country; and perhaps I could even\r\nhave lived unobserved in this. But to this I could not consent. I had\r\nalready become somewhat notorious, and withal quite as unpopular as\r\nnotorious; and I was, therefore, much exposed to arrest and recapture.\r\n\r\nThe main object to which my labors in Great Britain were directed, was\r\nthe concentration of the moral and religious sentiment of its people\r\nagainst American slavery. England is often charged with having\r\nestablished slavery in the United States, and if there were no other\r\njustification than this, for appealing to her people to lend their\r\nmoral aid for the abolition of slavery, I should be justified. My\r\nspeeches in Great Britain were wholly extemporaneous, and I may not\r\nalways have been so guarded in my expressions, as I otherwise should\r\nhave been. I was ten years younger then than now, and only seven years\r\nfrom slavery. I cannot give the reader a better idea of the nature of\r\nmy discourses, than by republishing one of them, delivered in Finsbury\r\nchapel, London, to an audience of about two thousand persons, and which\r\nwas published in the _London Universe_, at the time. 9\r\n\r\nThose in the United States who may regard this speech as being harsh in\r\nits spirit and unjust in its statements, because delivered before an\r\naudience supposed to be anti-republican in their principles and\r\nfeelings, may view the matter differently, when they learn that the\r\ncase supposed did not exist. It so happened that the great mass of the\r\npeople in England who attended and patronized my anti-slavery meetings,\r\nwere, in truth, about as good republicans as the mass of Americans, and\r\nwith this decided advantage over the latter—they are lovers of\r\nrepublicanism for all men, for black men as well as for white men. They\r\nare the people who sympathize with Louis Kossuth and Mazzini, and with\r\nthe oppressed and enslaved, of every color and nation, the world over.\r\nThey constitute the democratic element in British politics, and are as\r\nmuch opposed to the union of church and state as we, in America, are to\r\nsuch an union. At the meeting where this speech was delivered, Joseph\r\nSturge—a world-wide philanthropist, and a member of the society of\r\nFriends—presided, and addressed the meeting. George William Alexander,\r\nanother Friend, who has spent more than an Ameriacn(sic) fortune in\r\npromoting the anti-slavery cause in different sections of the world,\r\nwas on the platform; and also Dr. Campbell (now of the _British\r\nBanner_) who combines all the humane tenderness of Melanchthon, with\r\nthe directness and boldness of Luther. He is in the very front ranks of\r\nnon-conformists, and looks with no unfriendly eye upon America. George\r\nThompson, too, was there; and America will yet own that he did a true\r\nman’s work in relighting the rapidly dying-out fire of true\r\nrepublicanism in the American heart, and be ashamed of the treatment he\r\nmet at her hands. Coming generations in this country will applaud the\r\nspirit of this much abused republican friend of freedom. There were\r\nothers of note seated on the platform, who would gladly ingraft upon\r\nEnglish institutions all that is purely republican in the institutions\r\nof America. Nothing, therefore, must be set down against this speech on\r\nthe score that it was delivered in the presence of those who cannot\r\nappreciate the many excellent things belonging to our system of\r\ngovernment, and with a view to stir up prejudice against republican\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nAgain, let it also be remembered—for it is the simple truth—that\r\nneither in this speech, nor in any other which I delivered in England,\r\ndid I ever allow myself to address Englishmen as against Americans. I\r\ntook my stand on the high ground of human brotherhood, and spoke to\r\nEnglishmen as men, in behalf of men. Slavery is a crime, not against\r\nEnglishmen, but against God, and all the members of the human family;\r\nand it belongs to the whole human family to seek its suppression. In a\r\nletter to Mr. Greeley, of the New York Tribune, written while abroad, I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\nI am, nevertheless aware that the wisdom of exposing the sins of one\r\nnation in the ear of another, has been seriously questioned by good and\r\nclear-sighted people, both on this and on your side of the Atlantic.\r\nAnd the thought is not without weight on my own mind. I am satisfied\r\nthat there are many evils which can be best removed by confining our\r\nefforts to the immediate locality where such evils exist. This,\r\nhowever, is by no means the case with the system of slavery. It is such\r\na giant sin—such a monstrous aggregation of iniquity—so hardening to\r\nthe human heart—so destructive to the moral sense, and so well\r\ncalculated to beget a character, in every one around it, favorable to\r\nits own continuance,—that I feel not only at liberty, but abundantly\r\njustified, in appealing to the whole world to aid in its removal.\r\n\r\nBut, even if I had—as has been often charged—labored to bring American\r\ninstitutions generally into disrepute, and had not confined my labors\r\nstrictly within the limits of humanity and morality, I should not have\r\nbeen without illustrious examples to support me. Driven into semi-exile\r\nby civil and barbarous laws, and by a system which cannot be thought of\r\nwithout a shudder, I was fully justified in turning, if possible, the\r\ntide of the moral universe against the heaven-daring outrage.\r\n\r\nFour circumstances greatly assisted me in getting the question of\r\nAmerican slavery before the British public. First, the mob on board the\r\n“Cambria,” already referred to, which was a sort of national\r\nannouncement of my arrival in England. Secondly, the highly\r\nreprehensible course pursued by the Free Church of Scotland, in\r\nsoliciting, receiving, and retaining money in its sustentation fund for\r\nsupporting the gospel in Scotland, which was evidently the ill-gotten\r\ngain of slaveholders and slave-traders. Third, the great Evangelical\r\nAlliance—or rather the attempt to form such an alliance, which should\r\ninclude slaveholders of a certain description—added immensely to the\r\ninterest felt in the slavery question. About the same time, there was\r\nthe World’s Temperance Convention, where I had the misfortune to come\r\nin collision with sundry American doctors of divinity—Dr. Cox among the\r\nnumber—with whom I had a small controversy.\r\n\r\nIt has happened to me—as it has happened to most other men engaged in a\r\ngood cause—often to be more indebted to my enemies than to my own skill\r\nor to the assistance of my friends, for whatever success has attended\r\nmy labors. Great surprise was expressed by American newspapers, north\r\nand south, during my stay in Great Britain, that a person so illiterate\r\nand insignificant as myself could awaken an interest so marked in\r\nEngland. These papers were not the only parties surprised. I was myself\r\nnot far behind them in surprise. But the very contempt and scorn, the\r\nsystematic and extravagant disparagement of which I was the object,\r\nserved, perhaps, to magnify my few merits, and to render me of some\r\naccount, whether deserving or not. A man is sometimes made great, by\r\nthe greatness of the abuse a portion of mankind may think proper to\r\nheap upon him. Whether I was of as much consequence as the English\r\npapers made me out to be, or not, it was easily seen, in England, that\r\nI could not be the ignorant and worthless creature, some of the\r\nAmerican papers would have them believe I was. Men, in their senses, do\r\nnot take bowie-knives to kill mosquitoes, nor pistols to shoot flies;\r\nand the American passengers who thought proper to get up a mob to\r\nsilence me, on board the “Cambria,” took the most effective method of\r\ntelling the British public that I had something to say.\r\n\r\nBut to the second circumstance, namely, the position of the Free Church\r\nof Scotland, with the great Doctors Chalmers, Cunningham, and Candlish\r\nat its head. That church, with its leaders, put it out of the power of\r\nthe Scotch people to ask the old question, which we in the north have\r\noften most wickedly asked—“_What have we to do with slavery_?” That\r\nchurch had taken the price of blood into its treasury, with which to\r\nbuild _free_ churches, and to pay _free_ church ministers for preaching\r\nthe gospel; and, worse still, when honest John Murray, of Bowlien\r\nBay—now gone to his reward in heaven—with William Smeal, Andrew Paton,\r\nFrederick Card, and other sterling anti-slavery men in Glasgow,\r\ndenounced the transaction as disgraceful and shocking to the religious\r\nsentiment of Scotland, this church, through its leading divines,\r\ninstead of repenting and seeking to mend the mistake into which it had\r\nfallen, made it a flagrant sin, by undertaking to defend, in the name\r\nof God and the bible, the principle not only of taking the money of\r\nslave-dealers to build churches, but of holding fellowship with the\r\nholders and traffickers in human flesh. This, the reader will see,\r\nbrought up the whole question of slavery, and opened the way to its\r\nfull discussion, without any agency of mine. I have never seen a people\r\nmore deeply moved than were the people of Scotland, on this very\r\nquestion. Public meeting succeeded public meeting. Speech after speech,\r\npamphlet after pamphlet, editorial after editorial, sermon after\r\nsermon, soon lashed the conscientious Scotch people into a perfect\r\n_furore_. “SEND BACK THE MONEY!” was indignantly cried out, from\r\nGreenock to Edinburgh, and from Edinburgh to Aberdeen. George Thompson,\r\nof London, Henry C. Wright, of the United States, James N. Buffum, of\r\nLynn, Massachusetts, and myself were on the anti-slavery side; and\r\nDoctors Chalmers, Cunningham, and Candlish on the other. In a conflict\r\nwhere the latter could have had even the show of right, the truth, in\r\nour hands as against them, must have been driven to the wall; and while\r\nI believe we were able to carry the conscience of the country against\r\nthe action of the Free Church, the battle, it must be confessed, was a\r\nhard-fought one. Abler defenders of the doctrine of fellowshiping\r\nslaveholders as christians, have not been met with. In defending this\r\ndoctrine, it was necessary to deny that slavery is a sin. If driven\r\nfrom this position, they were compelled to deny that slaveholders were\r\nresponsible for the sin; and if driven from both these positions, they\r\nmust deny that it is a sin in such a sense, and that slaveholders are\r\nsinners in such a sense, as to make it wrong, in the circumstances in\r\nwhich they were placed, to recognize them as Christians. Dr. Cunningham\r\nwas the most powerful debater on the slavery side of the question; Mr.\r\nThompson was the ablest on the anti-slavery side. A scene occurred\r\nbetween these two men, a parallel to which I think I never witnessed\r\nbefore, and I know I never have since. The scene was caused by a single\r\nexclamation on the part of Mr. Thompson.\r\n\r\nThe general assembly of the Free Church was in progress at Cannon\r\nMills, Edinburgh. The building would hold about twenty-five hundred\r\npersons; and on this occasion it was densely packed, notice having been\r\ngiven that Doctors Cunningham and Candlish would speak, that day, in\r\ndefense of the relations of the Free Church of Scotland to slavery in\r\nAmerica. Messrs. Thompson, Buffum, myself, and a few anti-slavery\r\nfriends, attended, but sat at such a distance, and in such a position,\r\nthat, perhaps we were not observed from the platform. The excitement\r\nwas intense, having been greatly increased by a series of meetings held\r\nby Messrs. Thompson, Wright, Buffum, and myself, in the most splendid\r\nhall in that most beautiful city, just previous to the meetings of the\r\ngeneral assembly. “SEND BACK THE MONEY!” stared at us from every street\r\ncorner; “SEND BACK THE MONEY!” in large capitals, adorned the broad\r\nflags of the pavement; “SEND BACK THE MONEY!” was the chorus of the\r\npopular street songs; “SEND BACK THE MONEY!” was the heading of leading\r\neditorials in the daily newspapers. This day, at Cannon Mills, the\r\ngreat doctors of the church were to give an answer to this loud and\r\nstern demand. Men of all parties and all sects were most eager to hear.\r\nSomething great was expected. The occasion was great, the men great,\r\nand great speeches were expected from them.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the outside pressure upon Doctors Cunningham and\r\nCandlish, there was wavering in their own ranks. The conscience of the\r\nchurch itself was not at ease. A dissatisfaction with the position of\r\nthe church touching slavery, was sensibly manifest among the members,\r\nand something must be done to counteract this untoward influence. The\r\ngreat Dr. Chalmers was in feeble health, at the time. His most potent\r\neloquence could not now be summoned to Cannon Mills, as formerly. He\r\nwhose voice was able to rend asunder and dash down the granite walls of\r\nthe established church of Scotland, and to lead a host in solemn\r\nprocession from it, as from a doomed city, was now old and enfeebled.\r\nBesides, he had said his word on this very question; and his word had\r\nnot silenced the clamor without, nor stilled the anxious heavings\r\nwithin. The occasion was momentous, and felt to be so. The church was\r\nin a perilous condition. A change of some sort must take place in her\r\ncondition, or she must go to pieces. To stand where she did, was\r\nimpossible. The whole weight of the matter fell on Cunningham and\r\nCandlish. No shoulders in the church were broader than theirs; and I\r\nmust say, badly as I detest the principles laid down and defended by\r\nthem, I was compelled to acknowledge the vast mental endowments of the\r\nmen. Cunningham rose; and his rising was the signal for almost\r\ntumultous applause. You will say this was scarcely in keeping with the\r\nsolemnity of the occasion, but to me it served to increase its grandeur\r\nand gravity. The applause, though tumultuous, was not joyous. It seemed\r\nto me, as it thundered up from the vast audience, like the fall of an\r\nimmense shaft, flung from shoulders already galled by its crushing\r\nweight. It was like saying, “Doctor, we have borne this burden long\r\nenough, and willingly fling it upon you. Since it was you who brought\r\nit upon us, take it now, and do what you will with it, for we are too\r\nweary to bear it. [“no close”].\r\n\r\nDoctor Cunningham proceeded with his speech, abounding in logic,\r\nlearning, and eloquence, and apparently bearing down all opposition;\r\nbut at the moment—the fatal moment—when he was just bringing all his\r\narguments to a point, and that point being, that neither Jesus Christ\r\nnor his holy apostles regarded slaveholding as a sin, George Thompson,\r\nin a clear, sonorous, but rebuking voice, broke the deep stillness of\r\nthe audience, exclaiming, HEAR! HEAR! HEAR! The effect of this simple\r\nand common exclamation is almost incredible. It was as if a granite\r\nwall had been suddenly flung up against the advancing current of a\r\nmighty river. For a moment, speaker and audience were brought to a dead\r\nsilence. Both the doctor and his hearers seemed appalled by the\r\naudacity, as well as the fitness of the rebuke. At length a shout went\r\nup to the cry of “_Put him out_!” Happily, no one attempted to execute\r\nthis cowardly order, and the doctor proceeded with his discourse. Not,\r\nhowever, as before, did the learned doctor proceed. The exclamation of\r\nThompson must have reechoed itself a thousand times in his memory,\r\nduring the remainder of his speech, for the doctor never recovered from\r\nthe blow.\r\n\r\nThe deed was done, however; the pillars of the church—_the proud, Free\r\nChurch of Scotland_—were committed and the humility of repentance was\r\nabsent. The Free Church held on to the blood-stained money, and\r\ncontinued to justify itself in its position—and of course to apologize\r\nfor slavery—and does so till this day. She lost a glorious opportunity\r\nfor giving her voice, her vote, and her example to the cause of\r\nhumanity; and to-day she is staggering under the curse of the enslaved,\r\nwhose blood is in her skirts. The people of Scotland are, to this day,\r\ndeeply grieved at the course pursued by the Free Church, and would\r\nhail, as a relief from a deep and blighting shame, the “sending back\r\nthe money” to the slaveholders from whom it was gathered.\r\n\r\nOne good result followed the conduct of the Free Church; it furnished\r\nan occasion for making the people of Scotland thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith the character of slavery, and for arraying against the system the\r\nmoral and religious sentiment of that country. Therefore, while we did\r\nnot succeed in accomplishing the specific object of our mission,\r\nnamely—procure the sending back of the money—we were amply justified by\r\nthe good which really did result from our labors.\r\n\r\nNext comes the Evangelical Alliance. This was an attempt to form a\r\nunion of all evangelical Christians throughout the world. Sixty or\r\nseventy American divines attended, and some of them went there merely\r\nto weave a world-wide garment with which to clothe evangelical\r\nslaveholders. Foremost among these divines, was the Rev. Samuel Hanson\r\nCox, moderator of the New School Presbyterian General Assembly. He and\r\nhis friends spared no pains to secure a platform broad enough to hold\r\nAmerican slaveholders, and in this partly succeeded. But the question\r\nof slavery is too large a question to be finally disposed of, even by\r\nthe Evangelical Alliance. We appealed from the judgment of the\r\nAlliance, to the judgment of the people of Great Britain, and with the\r\nhappiest effect. This controversy with the Alliance might be made the\r\nsubject of extended remark, but I must forbear, except to say, that\r\nthis effort to shield the Christian character of slaveholders greatly\r\nserved to open a way to the British ear for anti-slavery discussion,\r\nand that it was well improved.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last circumstance that assisted me in getting before the\r\nBritish public, was an attempt on the part of certain doctors of\r\ndivinity to silence me on the platform of the World’s Temperance\r\nConvention. Here I was brought into point blank collison with Rev. Dr.\r\nCox, who made me the subject not only of bitter remark in the\r\nconvention, but also of a long denunciatory letter published in the New\r\nYork Evangelist and other American papers. I replied to the doctor as\r\nwell as I could, and was successful in getting a respectful hearing\r\nbefore the British public, who are by nature and practice ardent lovers\r\nof fair play, especially in a conflict between the weak and the strong.\r\n\r\nThus did circumstances favor me, and favor the cause of which I strove\r\nto be the advocate. After such distinguished notice, the public in both\r\ncountries was compelled to attach some importance to my labors. By the\r\nvery ill usage I received at the hands of Dr. Cox and his party, by the\r\nmob on board the “Cambria,” by the attacks made upon me in the American\r\nnewspapers, and by the aspersions cast upon me through the organs of\r\nthe Free Church of Scotland, I became one of that class of men, who,\r\nfor the moment, at least, “have greatness forced upon them.” People\r\nbecame the more anxious to hear for themselves, and to judge for\r\nthemselves, of the truth which I had to unfold. While, therefore, it is\r\nby no means easy for a stranger to get fairly before the British\r\npublic, it was my lot to accomplish it in the easiest manner possible.\r\n\r\nHaving continued in Great Britain and Ireland nearly two years, and\r\nbeing about to return to America—not as I left it, a slave, but a\r\nfreeman—leading friends of the cause of emancipation in that country\r\nintimated their intention to make me a testimonial, not only on grounds\r\nof personal regard to myself, but also to the cause to which they were\r\nso ardently devoted. How far any such thing could have succeeded, I do\r\nnot know; but many reasons led me to prefer that my friends should\r\nsimply give me the means of obtaining a printing press and printing\r\nmaterials, to enable me to start a paper, devoted to the interests of\r\nmy enslaved and oppressed people. I told them that perhaps the greatest\r\nhinderance to the adoption of abolition principles by the people of the\r\nUnited States, was the low estimate, everywhere in that country, placed\r\nupon the Negro, as a man; that because of his assumed natural\r\ninferiority, people reconciled themselves to his enslavement and\r\noppression, as things inevitable, if not desirable. The grand thing to\r\nbe done, therefore, was to change the estimation in which the colored\r\npeople of the United States were held; to remove the prejudice which\r\ndepreciated and depressed them; to prove them worthy of a higher\r\nconsideration; to disprove their alleged inferiority, and demonstrate\r\ntheir capacity for a more exalted civilization than slavery and\r\nprejudice had assigned to them. I further stated, that, in my judgment,\r\na tolerably well conducted press, in the hands of persons of the\r\ndespised race, by calling out the mental energies of the race itself;\r\nby making them acquainted with their own latent powers; by enkindling\r\namong them the hope that for them there is a future; by developing\r\ntheir moral power; by combining and reflecting their talents—would\r\nprove a most powerful means of removing prejudice, and of awakening an\r\ninterest in them. I further informed them—and at that time the\r\nstatement was true—that there was not, in the United States, a single\r\nnewspaper regularly published by the colored people; that many attempts\r\nhad been made to establish such papers; but that, up to that time, they\r\nhad all failed. These views I laid before my friends. The result was,\r\nnearly two thousand five hundred dollars were speedily raised toward\r\nstarting my paper. For this prompt and generous assistance, rendered\r\nupon my bare suggestion, without any personal efforts on my part, I\r\nshall never cease to feel deeply grateful; and the thought of\r\nfulfilling the noble expectations of the dear friends who gave me this\r\nevidence of their confidence, will never cease to be a motive for\r\npersevering exertion.\r\n\r\nProposing to leave England, and turning my face toward America, in the\r\nspring of 1847, I was met, on the threshold, with something which\r\npainfully reminded me of the kind of life which awaited me in my native\r\nland. For the first time in the many months spent abroad, I was met\r\nwith proscription on account of my color. A few weeks before departing\r\nfrom England, while in London, I was careful to purchase a ticket, and\r\nsecure a berth for returning home, in the “Cambria”—the steamer in\r\nwhich I left the United States—paying therefor the round sum of forty\r\npounds and nineteen shillings sterling. This was first cabin fare. But\r\non going aboard the Cambria, I found that the Liverpool agent had\r\nordered my berth to be given to another, and had forbidden my entering\r\nthe saloon! This contemptible conduct met with stern rebuke from the\r\nBritish press. For, upon the point of leaving England, I took occasion\r\nto expose the disgusting tyranny, in the columns of the London _Times_.\r\nThat journal, and other leading journals throughout the United Kingdom,\r\nheld up the outrage to unmitigated condemnation. So good an opportunity\r\nfor calling out a full expression of British sentiment on the subject,\r\nhad not before occurred, and it was most fully embraced. The result\r\nwas, that Mr. Cunard came out in a letter to the public journals,\r\nassuring them of his regret at the outrage, and promising that the like\r\nshould never occur again on board his steamers; and the like, we\r\nbelieve, has never since occurred on board the steamships of the Cunard\r\nline.\r\n\r\nIt is not very pleasant to be made the subject of such insults; but if\r\nall such necessarily resulted as this one did, I should be very happy\r\nto bear, patiently, many more than I have borne, of the same sort.\r\nAlbeit, the lash of proscription, to a man accustomed to equal social\r\nposition, even for a time, as I was, has a sting for the soul hardly\r\nless severe than that which bites the flesh and draws the blood from\r\nthe back of the plantation slave. It was rather hard, after having\r\nenjoyed nearly two years of equal social privileges in England, often\r\ndining with gentlemen of great literary, social, political, and\r\nreligious eminence never, during the whole time, having met with a\r\nsingle word, look, or gesture, which gave me the slightest reason to\r\nthink my color was an offense to anybody—now to be cooped up in the\r\nstern of the “Cambria,” and denied the right to enter the saloon, lest\r\nmy dark presence should be deemed an offense to some of my democratic\r\nfellow-passengers. The reader will easily imagine what must have been\r\nmy feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. _Various Incidents_\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPER ENTERPRISE—UNEXPECTED OPPOSITION—THE OBJECTIONS TO IT—THEIR\r\nPLAUSIBILITY ADMITTED—MOTIVES FOR COMING TO ROCHESTER—DISCIPLE OF MR.\r\nGARRISON—CHANGE OF OPINION—CAUSES LEADING TO IT—THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE\r\nCHANGE—PREJUDICE AGAINST COLOR—AMUSING CONDESCENSION—“JIM CROW\r\nCARS”—COLLISIONS WITH CONDUCTORS AND BRAKEMEN—TRAINS ORDERED NOT TO\r\nSTOP AT LYNN—AMUSING DOMESTIC SCENE—SEPARATE TABLES FOR MASTER AND\r\nMAN—PREJUDICE UNNATURAL—ILLUSTRATIONS—IN HIGH COMPANY—ELEVATION OF THE\r\nFREE PEOPLE OF COLOR—PLEDGE FOR THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now given the reader an imperfect sketch of nine years’\r\nexperience in freedom—three years as a common laborer on the wharves of\r\nNew Bedford, four years as a lecturer in New England, and two years of\r\nsemi-exile in Great Britain and Ireland. A single ray of light remains\r\nto be flung upon my life during the last eight years, and my story will\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nA trial awaited me on my return from England to the United States, for\r\nwhich I was but very imperfectly prepared. My plans for my then future\r\nusefulness as an anti-slavery advocate were all settled. My friends in\r\nEngland had resolved to raise a given sum to purchase for me a press\r\nand printing materials; and I already saw myself wielding my pen, as\r\nwell as my voice, in the great work of renovating the public mind, and\r\nbuilding up a public sentiment which should, at least, send slavery and\r\noppression to the grave, and restore to “liberty and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness” the people with whom I had suffered, both as a slave and as\r\na freeman. Intimation had reached my friends in Boston of what I\r\nintended to do, before my arrival, and I was prepared to find them\r\nfavorably disposed toward my much cherished enterprise. In this I was\r\nmistaken. I found them very earnestly opposed to the idea of my\r\nstarting a paper, and for several reasons. First, the paper was not\r\nneeded; secondly, it would interfere with my usefulness as a lecturer;\r\nthirdly, I was better fitted to speak than to write; fourthly, the\r\npaper could not succeed. This opposition, from a quarter so highly\r\nesteemed, and to which I had been accustomed to look for advice and\r\ndirection, caused me not only to hesitate, but inclined me to abandon\r\nthe enterprise. All previous attempts to establish such a journal\r\nhaving failed, I felt that probably I should but add another to the\r\nlist of failures, and thus contribute another proof of the mental and\r\nmoral deficiencies of my race. Very much that was said to me in respect\r\nto my imperfect literary acquirements, I felt to be most painfully\r\ntrue. The unsuccessful projectors of all the previous colored\r\nnewspapers were my superiors in point of education, and if they failed,\r\nhow could I hope for success? Yet I did hope for success, and persisted\r\nin the undertaking. Some of my English friends greatly encouraged me to\r\ngo forward, and I shall never cease to be grateful for their words of\r\ncheer and generous deeds.\r\n\r\nI can easily pardon those who have denounced me as ambitious and\r\npresumptuous, in view of my persistence in this enterprise. I was but\r\nnine years from slavery. In point of mental experience, I was but nine\r\nyears old. That one, in such circumstances, should aspire to establish\r\na printing press, among an educated people, might well be considered,\r\nif not ambitious, quite silly. My American friends looked at me with\r\nastonishment! “A wood-sawyer” offering himself to the public as an\r\neditor! A slave, brought up in the very depths of ignorance, assuming\r\nto instruct the highly civilized people of the north in the principles\r\nof liberty, justice, and humanity! The thing looked absurd.\r\nNevertheless, I persevered. I felt that the want of education, great as\r\nit was, could be overcome by study, and that knowledge would come by\r\nexperience; and further (which was perhaps the most controlling\r\nconsideration). I thought that an intelligent public, knowing my early\r\nhistory, would easily pardon a large share of the deficiencies which I\r\nwas sure that my paper would exhibit. The most distressing thing,\r\nhowever, was the offense which I was about to give my Boston friends,\r\nby what seemed to them a reckless disregard of their sage advice. I am\r\nnot sure that I was not under the influence of something like a slavish\r\nadoration of my Boston friends, and I labored hard to convince them of\r\nthe wisdom of my undertaking, but without success. Indeed, I never\r\nexpect to succeed, although time has answered all their original\r\nobjections. The paper has been successful. It is a large sheet, costing\r\neighty dollars per week—has three thousand subscribers—has been\r\npublished regularly nearly eight years—and bids fair to stand eight\r\nyears longer. At any rate, the eight years to come are as full of\r\npromise as were the eight that are past.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be concealed, however, that the maintenance of such a\r\njournal, under the circumstances, has been a work of much difficulty;\r\nand could all the perplexity, anxiety, and trouble attending it, have\r\nbeen clearly foreseen, I might have shrunk from the undertaking. As it\r\nis, I rejoice in having engaged in the enterprise, and count it joy to\r\nhave been able to suffer, in many ways, for its success, and for the\r\nsuccess of the cause to which it has been faithfully devoted. I look\r\nupon the time, money, and labor bestowed upon it, as being amply\r\nrewarded, in the development of my own mental and moral energies, and\r\nin the corresponding development of my deeply injured and oppressed\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nFrom motives of peace, instead of issuing my paper in Boston, among my\r\nNew England friends, I came to Rochester, western New York, among\r\nstrangers, where the circulation of my paper could not interfere with\r\nthe local circulation of the _Liberator_ and the _Standard;_ for at\r\nthat time I was, on the anti-slavery question, a faithful disciple of\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, and fully committed to his doctrine touching\r\nthe pro-slavery character of the constitution of the United States, and\r\nthe _non-voting principle_, of which he is the known and distinguished\r\nadvocate. With Mr. Garrison, I held it to be the first duty of the\r\nnon-slaveholding states to dissolve the union with the slaveholding\r\nstates; and hence my cry, like his, was, “No union with slaveholders.”\r\nWith these views, I came into western New York; and during the first\r\nfour years of my labor here, I advocated them with pen and tongue,\r\naccording to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nAbout four years ago, upon a reconsideration of the whole subject, I\r\nbecame convinced that there was no necessity for dissolving the “union\r\nbetween the northern and southern states;” that to seek this\r\ndissolution was no part of my duty as an abolitionist; that to abstain\r\nfrom voting, was to refuse to exercise a legitimate and powerful means\r\nfor abolishing slavery; and that the constitution of the United States\r\nnot only contained no guarantees in favor of slavery, but, on the\r\ncontrary, it is, in its letter and spirit, an anti-slavery instrument,\r\ndemanding the abolition of slavery as a condition of its own existence,\r\nas the supreme law of the land.\r\n\r\nHere was a radical change in my opinions, and in the action logically\r\nresulting from that change. To those with whom I had been in agreement\r\nand in sympathy, I was now in opposition. What they held to be a great\r\nand important truth, I now looked upon as a dangerous error. A very\r\npainful, and yet a very natural, thing now happened. Those who could\r\nnot see any honest reasons for changing their views, as I had done,\r\ncould not easily see any such reasons for my change, and the common\r\npunishment of apostates was mine.\r\n\r\nThe opinions first entertained were naturally derived and honestly\r\nentertained, and I trust that my present opinions have the same claims\r\nto respect. Brought directly, when I escaped from slavery, into contact\r\nwith a class of abolitionists regarding the constitution as a\r\nslaveholding instrument, and finding their views supported by the\r\nunited and entire history of every department of the government, it is\r\nnot strange that I assumed the constitution to be just what their\r\ninterpretation made it. I was bound, not only by their superior\r\nknowledge, to take their opinions as the true ones, in respect to the\r\nsubject, but also because I had no means of showing their unsoundness.\r\nBut for the responsibility of conducting a public journal, and the\r\nnecessity imposed upon me of meeting opposite views from abolitionists\r\nin this state, I should in all probability have remained as firm in my\r\ndisunion views as any other disciple of William Lloyd Garrison.\r\n\r\nMy new circumstances compelled me to re-think the whole subject, and to\r\nstudy, with some care, not only the just and proper rules of legal\r\ninterpretation, but the origin, design, nature, rights, powers, and\r\nduties of civil government, and also the relations which human beings\r\nsustain to it. By such a course of thought and reading, I was conducted\r\nto the conclusion that the constitution of the United\r\nStates—inaugurated “to form a more perfect union, establish justice,\r\ninsure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote\r\nthe general welfare, and secure the blessing of liberty”—could not well\r\nhave been designed at the same time to maintain and perpetuate a system\r\nof rapine and murder, like slavery; especially, as not one word can be\r\nfound in the constitution to authorize such a belief. Then, again, if\r\nthe declared purposes of an instrument are to govern the meaning of all\r\nits parts and details, as they clearly should, the constitution of our\r\ncountry is our warrant for the abolition of slavery in every state in\r\nthe American Union. I mean, however, not to argue, but simply to state\r\nmy views. It would require very many pages of a volume like this, to\r\nset forth the arguments demonstrating the unconstitutionality and the\r\ncomplete illegality of slavery in our land; and as my experience, and\r\nnot my arguments, is within the scope and contemplation of this volume,\r\nI omit the latter and proceed with the former.\r\n\r\nI will now ask the kind reader to go back a little in my story, while I\r\nbring up a thread left behind for convenience sake, but which, small as\r\nit is, cannot be properly omitted altogether; and that thread is\r\nAmerican prejudice against color, and its varied illustrations in my\r\nown experience.\r\n\r\nWhen I first went among the abolitionists of New England, and began to\r\ntravel, I found this prejudice very strong and very annoying. The\r\nabolitionists themselves were not entirely free from it, and I could\r\nsee that they were nobly struggling against it. In their eagerness,\r\nsometimes, to show their contempt for the feeling, they proved that\r\nthey had not entirely recovered from it; often illustrating the saying,\r\nin their conduct, that a man may “stand up so straight as to lean\r\nbackward.” When it was said to me, “Mr. Douglass, I will walk to\r\nmeeting with you; I am not afraid of a black man,” I could not help\r\nthinking—seeing nothing very frightful in my appearance—“And why should\r\nyou be?” The children at the north had all been educated to believe\r\nthat if they were bad, the old _black_ man—not the old _devil_—would\r\nget them; and it was evidence of some courage, for any so educated to\r\nget the better of their fears.\r\n\r\nThe custom of providing separate cars for the accommodation of colored\r\ntravelers, was established on nearly all the railroads of New England,\r\na dozen years ago. Regarding this custom as fostering the spirit of\r\ncaste, I made it a rule to seat myself in the cars for the\r\naccommodation of passengers generally. Thus seated, I was sure to be\r\ncalled upon to betake myself to the “_Jim Crow car_.” Refusing to obey,\r\nI was often dragged out of my seat, beaten, and severely bruised, by\r\nconductors and brakemen. Attempting to start from Lynn, one day, for\r\nNewburyport, on the Eastern railroad, I went, as my custom was, into\r\none of the best railroad carriages on the road. The seats were very\r\nluxuriant and beautiful. I was soon waited upon by the conductor, and\r\nordered out; whereupon I demanded the reason for my invidious removal.\r\nAfter a good deal of parleying, I was told that it was because I was\r\nblack. This I denied, and appealed to the company to sustain my denial;\r\nbut they were evidently unwilling to commit themselves, on a point so\r\ndelicate, and requiring such nice powers of discrimination, for they\r\nremained as dumb as death. I was soon waited on by half a dozen fellows\r\nof the baser sort (just such as would volunteer to take a bull-dog out\r\nof a meeting-house in time of public worship), and told that I must\r\nmove out of that seat, and if I did not, they would drag me out. I\r\nrefused to move, and they clutched me, head, neck, and shoulders. But,\r\nin anticipation of the stretching to which I was about to be subjected,\r\nI had interwoven myself among the seats. In dragging me out, on this\r\noccasion, it must have cost the company twenty-five or thirty dollars,\r\nfor I tore up seats and all. So great was the excitement in Lynn, on\r\nthe subject, that the superintendent, Mr. Stephen A. Chase, ordered the\r\ntrains to run through Lynn without stopping, while I remained in that\r\ntown; and this ridiculous farce was enacted. For several days the\r\ntrains went dashing through Lynn without stopping. At the same time\r\nthat they excluded a free colored man from their cars, this same\r\ncompany allowed slaves, in company with their masters and mistresses,\r\nto ride unmolested.\r\n\r\nAfter many battles with the railroad conductors, and being roughly\r\nhandled in not a few instances, proscription was at last abandoned; and\r\nthe “Jim Crow car”—set up for the degradation of colored people—is\r\nnowhere found in New England. This result was not brought about without\r\nthe intervention of the people, and the threatened enactment of a law\r\ncompelling railroad companies to respect the rights of travelers. Hon.\r\nCharles Francis Adams performed signal service in the Massachusetts\r\nlegislature, in bringing this reformation; and to him the colored\r\ncitizens of that state are deeply indebted.\r\n\r\nAlthough often annoyed, and sometimes outraged, by this prejudice\r\nagainst color, I am indebted to it for many passages of quiet\r\namusement. A half-cured subject of it is sometimes driven into awkward\r\nstraits, especially if he happens to get a genuine specimen of the race\r\ninto his house.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1843, I was traveling and lecturing, in company with\r\nWilliam A. White, Esq., through the state of Indiana. Anti-slavery\r\nfriends were not very abundant in Indiana, at that time, and beds were\r\nnot more plentiful than friends. We often slept out, in preference to\r\nsleeping in the houses, at some points. At the close of one of our\r\nmeetings, we were invited home with a kindly-disposed old farmer, who,\r\nin the generous enthusiasm of the moment, seemed to have forgotten that\r\nhe had but one spare bed, and that his guests were an ill-matched pair.\r\nAll went on pretty well, till near bed time, when signs of uneasiness\r\nbegan to show themselves, among the unsophisticated sons and daughters.\r\nWhite is remarkably fine looking, and very evidently a born gentleman;\r\nthe idea of putting us in the same bed was hardly to be tolerated; and\r\nyet, there we were, and but the one bed for us, and that, by the way,\r\nwas in the same room occupied by the other members of the family.\r\nWhite, as well as I, perceived the difficulty, for yonder slept the old\r\nfolks, there the sons, and a little farther along slept the daughters;\r\nand but one other bed remained. Who should have this bed, was the\r\npuzzling question. There was some whispering between the old folks,\r\nsome confused looks among the young, as the time for going to bed\r\napproached. After witnessing the confusion as long as I liked, I\r\nrelieved the kindly-disposed family by playfully saying, “Friend White,\r\nhaving got entirely rid of my prejudice against color, I think, as a\r\nproof of it, I must allow you to sleep with me to-night.” White kept up\r\nthe joke, by seeming to esteem himself the favored party, and thus the\r\ndifficulty was removed. If we went to a hotel, and called for dinner,\r\nthe landlord was sure to set one table for White and another for me,\r\nalways taking him to be master, and me the servant. Large eyes were\r\ngenerally made when the order was given to remove the dishes from my\r\ntable to that of White’s. In those days, it was thought strange that a\r\nwhite man and a colored man could dine peaceably at the same table, and\r\nin some parts the strangeness of such a sight has not entirely\r\nsubsided.\r\n\r\nSome people will have it that there is a natural, an inherent, and an\r\ninvincible repugnance in the breast of the white race toward\r\ndark-colored people; and some very intelligent colored men think that\r\ntheir proscription is owing solely to the color which nature has given\r\nthem. They hold that they are rated according to their color, and that\r\nit is impossible for white people ever to look upon dark races of men,\r\nor men belonging to the African race, with other than feelings of\r\naversion. My experience, both serious and mirthful, combats this\r\nconclusion. Leaving out of sight, for a moment, grave facts, to this\r\npoint, I will state one or two, which illustrate a very interesting\r\nfeature of American character as well as American prejudice. Riding\r\nfrom Boston to Albany, a few years ago, I found myself in a large car,\r\nwell filled with passengers. The seat next to me was about the only\r\nvacant one. At every stopping place we took in new passengers, all of\r\nwhom, on reaching the seat next to me, cast a disdainful glance upon\r\nit, and passed to another car, leaving me in the full enjoyment of a\r\nhole form. For a time, I did not know but that my riding there was\r\nprejudicial to the interest of the railroad company. A circumstance\r\noccurred, however, which gave me an elevated position at once. Among\r\nthe passengers on this train was Gov. George N. Briggs. I was not\r\nacquainted with him, and had no idea that I was known to him, however,\r\nI was, for upon observing me, the governor left his place, and making\r\nhis way toward me, respectfully asked the privilege of a seat by my\r\nside; and upon introducing himself, we entered into a conversation very\r\npleasant and instructive to me. The despised seat now became honored.\r\nHis excellency had removed all the prejudice against sitting by the\r\nside of a Negro; and upon his leaving it, as he did, on reaching\r\nPittsfield, there were at least one dozen applicants for the place. The\r\ngovernor had, without changing my skin a single shade, made the place\r\nrespectable which before was despicable.\r\n\r\nA similar incident happened to me once on the Boston and New Bedford\r\nrailroad, and the leading party to it has since been governor of the\r\nstate of Massachusetts. I allude to Col. John Henry Clifford. Lest the\r\nreader may fancy I am aiming to elevate myself, by claiming too much\r\nintimacy with great men, I must state that my only acquaintance with\r\nCol. Clifford was formed while I was _his hired servant_, during the\r\nfirst winter of my escape from slavery. I owe it him to say, that in\r\nthat relation I found him always kind and gentlemanly. But to the\r\nincident. I entered a car at Boston, for New Bedford, which, with the\r\nexception of a single seat was full, and found I must occupy this, or\r\nstand up, during the journey. Having no mind to do this, I stepped up\r\nto the man having the next seat, and who had a few parcels on the seat,\r\nand gently asked leave to take a seat by his side. My fellow-passenger\r\ngave me a look made up of reproach and indignation, and asked me why I\r\nshould come to that particular seat. I assured him, in the gentlest\r\nmanner, that of all others this was the seat for me. Finding that I was\r\nactually about to sit down, he sang out, “O! stop, stop! and let me get\r\nout!” Suiting the action to the word, up the agitated man got, and\r\nsauntered to the other end of the car, and was compelled to stand for\r\nmost of the way thereafter. Halfway to New Bedford, or more, Col.\r\nClifford, recognizing me, left his seat, and not having seen me before\r\nsince I had ceased to wait on him (in everything except hard arguments\r\nagainst his pro-slavery position), apparently forgetful of his rank,\r\nmanifested, in greeting me, something of the feeling of an old friend.\r\nThis demonstration was not lost on the gentleman whose dignity I had,\r\nan hour before, most seriously offended. Col. Clifford was known to be\r\nabout the most aristocratic gentleman in Bristol county; and it was\r\nevidently thought that I must be somebody, else I should not have been\r\nthus noticed, by a person so distinguished. Sure enough, after Col.\r\nClifford left me, I found myself surrounded with friends; and among the\r\nnumber, my offended friend stood nearest, and with an apology for his\r\nrudeness, which I could not resist, although it was one of the lamest\r\never offered. With such facts as these before me—and I have many of\r\nthem—I am inclined to think that pride and fashion have much to do with\r\nthe treatment commonly extended to colored people in the United States.\r\nI once heard a very plain man say (and he was cross-eyed, and awkwardly\r\nflung together in other respects) that he should be a handsome man when\r\npublic opinion shall be changed.\r\n\r\nSince I have been editing and publishing a journal devoted to the cause\r\nof liberty and progress, I have had my mind more directed to the\r\ncondition and circumstances of the free colored people than when I was\r\nthe agent of an abolition society. The result has been a corresponding\r\nchange in the disposition of my time and labors. I have felt it to be a\r\npart of my mission—under a gracious Providence to impress my sable\r\nbrothers in this country with the conviction that, notwithstanding the\r\nten thousand discouragements and the powerful hinderances, which beset\r\ntheir existence in this country—notwithstanding the blood-written\r\nhistory of Africa, and her children, from whom we have descended, or\r\nthe clouds and darkness (whose stillness and gloom are made only more\r\nawful by wrathful thunder and lightning) now overshadowing\r\nthem—progress is yet possible, and bright skies shall yet shine upon\r\ntheir pathway; and that “Ethiopia shall yet reach forth her hand unto\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\nBelieving that one of the best means of emancipating the slaves of the\r\nsouth is to improve and elevate the character of the free colored\r\npeople of the north I shall labor in the future, as I have labored in\r\nthe past, to promote the moral, social, religious, and intellectual\r\nelevation of the free colored people; never forgetting my own humble\r\norgin(sic), nor refusing, while Heaven lends me ability, to use my\r\nvoice, my pen, or my vote, to advocate the great and primary work of\r\nthe universal and unconditional emancipation of my entire race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION SPEECH 10. At Finsbury Chapel, Moorfields, England, May 12,\r\n\r\n\r\n1846\r\n\r\nMr. Douglass rose amid loud cheers, and said: I feel exceedingly glad\r\nof the opportunity now afforded me of presenting the claims of my\r\nbrethren in bonds in the United States, to so many in London and from\r\nvarious parts of Britain, who have assembled here on the present\r\noccasion. I have nothing to commend me to your consideration in the way\r\nof learning, nothing in the way of education, to entitle me to your\r\nattention; and you are aware that slavery is a very bad school for\r\nrearing teachers of morality and religion. Twenty-one years of my life\r\nhave been spent in slavery—personal slavery—surrounded by degrading\r\ninfluences, such as can exist nowhere beyond the pale of slavery; and\r\nit will not be strange, if under such circumstances, I should betray,\r\nin what I have to say to you, a deficiency of that refinement which is\r\nseldom or ever found, except among persons that have experienced\r\nsuperior advantages to those which I have enjoyed. But I will take it\r\nfor granted that you know something about the degrading influences of\r\nslavery, and that you will not expect great things from me this\r\nevening, but simply such facts as I may be able to advance immediately\r\nin connection with my own experience of slavery.\r\n\r\nNow, what is this system of slavery? This is the subject of my lecture\r\nthis evening—what is the character of this institution? I am about to\r\nanswer the inquiry, what is American slavery? I do this the more\r\nreadily, since I have found persons in this country who have identified\r\nthe term slavery with that which I think it is not, and in some\r\ninstances, I have feared, in so doing, have rather (unwittingly, I\r\nknow) detracted much from the horror with which the term slavery is\r\ncontemplated. It is common in this country to distinguish every bad\r\nthing by the name of slavery. Intemperance is slavery; to be deprived\r\nof the right to vote is slavery, says one; to have to work hard is\r\nslavery, says another; and I do not know but that if we should let them\r\ngo on, they would say that to eat when we are hungry, to walk when we\r\ndesire to have exercise, or to minister to our necessities, or have\r\nnecessities at all, is slavery. I do not wish for a moment to detract\r\nfrom the horror with which the evil of intemperance is contemplated—not\r\nat all; nor do I wish to throw the slightest obstruction in the way of\r\nany political freedom that any class of persons in this country may\r\ndesire to obtain. But I am here to say that I think the term slavery is\r\nsometimes abused by identifying it with that which it is not. Slavery\r\nin the United States is the granting of that power by which one man\r\nexercises and enforces a right of property in the body and soul of\r\nanother. The condition of a slave is simply that of the brute beast. He\r\nis a piece of property—a marketable commodity, in the language of the\r\nlaw, to be bought or sold at the will and caprice of the master who\r\nclaims him to be his property; he is spoken of, thought of, and treated\r\nas property. His own good, his conscience, his intellect, his\r\naffections, are all set aside by the master. The will and the wishes of\r\nthe master are the law of the slave. He is as much a piece of property\r\nas a horse. If he is fed, he is fed because he is property. If he is\r\nclothed, it is with a view to the increase of his value as property.\r\nWhatever of comfort is necessary to him for his body or soul that is\r\ninconsistent with his being property, is carefully wrested from him,\r\nnot only by public opinion, but by the law of the country. He is\r\ncarefully deprived of everything that tends in the slightest degree to\r\ndetract from his value as property. He is deprived of education. God\r\nhas given him an intellect; the slaveholder declares it shall not be\r\ncultivated. If his moral perception leads him in a course contrary to\r\nhis value as property, the slaveholder declares he shall not exercise\r\nit. The marriage institution cannot exist among slaves, and one-sixth\r\nof the population of democratic America is denied its privileges by the\r\nlaw of the land. What is to be thought of a nation boasting of its\r\nliberty, boasting of its humanity, boasting of its Christianity,\r\nboasting of its love of justice and purity, and yet having within its\r\nown borders three millions of persons denied by law the right of\r\nmarriage?—what must be the condition of that people? I need not lift up\r\nthe veil by giving you any experience of my own. Every one that can put\r\ntwo ideas together, must see the most fearful results from such a state\r\nof things as I have just mentioned. If any of these three millions find\r\nfor themselves companions, and prove themselves honest, upright,\r\nvirtuous persons to each other, yet in these cases—few as I am bound to\r\nconfess they are—the virtuous live in constant apprehension of being\r\ntorn asunder by the merciless men-stealers that claim them as their\r\nproperty. This is American slavery; no marriage—no education—the light\r\nof the gospel shut out from the dark mind of the bondman—and he\r\nforbidden by law to learn to read. If a mother shall teach her children\r\nto read, the law in Louisiana proclaims that she may be hanged by the\r\nneck. If the father attempt to give his son a knowledge of letters, he\r\nmay be punished by the whip in one instance, and in another be killed,\r\nat the discretion of the court. Three millions of people shut out from\r\nthe light of knowledge! It is easy for you to conceive the evil that\r\nmust result from such a state of things.\r\n\r\nI now come to the physical evils of slavery. I do not wish to dwell at\r\nlength upon these, but it seems right to speak of them, not so much to\r\ninfluence your minds on this question, as to let the slaveholders of\r\nAmerica know that the curtain which conceals their crimes is being\r\nlifted abroad; that we are opening the dark cell, and leading the\r\npeople into the horrible recesses of what they are pleased to call\r\ntheir domestic institution. We want them to know that a knowledge of\r\ntheir whippings, their scourgings, their brandings, their chainings, is\r\nnot confined to their plantations, but that some Negro of theirs has\r\nbroken loose from his chains—has burst through the dark incrustation of\r\nslavery, and is now exposing their deeds of deep damnation to the gaze\r\nof the christian people of England.\r\n\r\nThe slaveholders resort to all kinds of cruelty. If I were disposed, I\r\nhave matter enough to interest you on this question for five or six\r\nevenings, but I will not dwell at length upon these cruelties. Suffice\r\nit to say, that all of the peculiar modes of torture that were resorted\r\nto in the West India islands, are resorted to, I believe, even more\r\nfrequently, in the United States of America. Starvation, the bloody\r\nwhip, the chain, the gag, the thumb-screw, cat-hauling, the\r\ncat-o’-nine-tails, the dungeon, the blood-hound, are all in requisition\r\nto keep the slave in his condition as a slave in the United States. If\r\nany one has a doubt upon this point, I would ask him to read the\r\nchapter on slavery in Dickens’s _Notes on America_. If any man has a\r\ndoubt upon it, I have here the “testimony of a thousand witnesses,”\r\nwhich I can give at any length, all going to prove the truth of my\r\nstatement. The blood-hound is regularly trained in the United States,\r\nand advertisements are to be found in the southern papers of the Union,\r\nfrom persons advertising themselves as blood-hound trainers, and\r\noffering to hunt down slaves at fifteen dollars a piece, recommending\r\ntheir hounds as the fleetest in the neighborhood, never known to fail.\r\nAdvertisements are from time to time inserted, stating that slaves have\r\nescaped with iron collars about their necks, with bands of iron about\r\ntheir feet, marked with the lash, branded with red-hot irons, the\r\ninitials of their master’s name burned into their flesh; and the\r\nmasters advertise the fact of their being thus branded with their own\r\nsignature, thereby proving to the world, that, however damning it may\r\nappear to non-slavers, such practices are not regarded discreditable\r\namong the slaveholders themselves. Why, I believe if a man should brand\r\nhis horse in this country—burn the initials of his name into any of his\r\ncattle, and publish the ferocious deed here—that the united execrations\r\nof Christians in Britain would descend upon him. Yet in the United\r\nStates, human beings are thus branded. As Whittier says—\r\n\r\n... Our countrymen in chains,\r\nThe whip on woman’s shrinking flesh,\r\nOur soil yet reddening with the stains\r\nCaught from her scourgings warm and fresh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe slave-dealer boldly publishes his infamous acts to the world. Of\r\nall things that have been said of slavery to which exception has been\r\ntaken by slaveholders, this, the charge of cruelty, stands foremost,\r\nand yet there is no charge capable of clearer demonstration, than that\r\nof the most barbarous inhumanity on the part of the slaveholders toward\r\ntheir slaves. And all this is necessary; it is necessary to resort to\r\nthese cruelties, in order to _make the slave a slave_, and to _keep him\r\na slave_. Why, my experience all goes to prove the truth of what you\r\nwill call a marvelous proposition, that the better you treat a slave,\r\nthe more you destroy his value _as a slave_, and enhance the\r\nprobability of his eluding the grasp of the slaveholder; the more\r\nkindly you treat him, the more wretched you make him, while you keep\r\nhim in the condition of a slave. My experience, I say, confirms the\r\ntruth of this proposition. When I was treated exceedingly ill; when my\r\nback was being scourged daily; when I was whipped within an inch of my\r\nlife—_life_ was all I cared for. “Spare my life,” was my continual\r\nprayer. When I was looking for the blow about to be inflicted upon my\r\nhead, I was not thinking of my liberty; it was my life. But, as soon as\r\nthe blow was not to be feared, then came the longing for liberty. If a\r\nslave has a bad master, his ambition is to get a better; when he gets a\r\nbetter, he aspires to have the best; and when he gets the best, he\r\naspires to be his own master. But the slave must be brutalized to keep\r\nhim as a slave. The slaveholder feels this necessity. I admit this\r\nnecessity. If it be right to hold slaves at all, it is right to hold\r\nthem in the only way in which they can be held; and this can be done\r\nonly by shutting out the light of education from their minds, and\r\nbrutalizing their persons. The whip, the chain, the gag, the\r\nthumb-screw, the blood-hound, the stocks, and all the other bloody\r\nparaphernalia of the slave system, are indispensably necessary to the\r\nrelation of master and slave. The slave must be subjected to these, or\r\nhe ceases to be a slave. Let him know that the whip is burned; that the\r\nfetters have been turned to some useful and profitable employment; that\r\nthe chain is no longer for his limbs; that the blood-hound is no longer\r\nto be put upon his track; that his master’s authority over him is no\r\nlonger to be enforced by taking his life—and immediately he walks out\r\nfrom the house of bondage and asserts his freedom as a man. The\r\nslaveholder finds it necessary to have these implements to keep the\r\nslave in bondage; finds it necessary to be able to say, “Unless you do\r\nso and so; unless you do as I bid you—I will take away your life!”\r\n\r\nSome of the most awful scenes of cruelty are constantly taking place in\r\nthe middle states of the Union. We have in those states what are called\r\nthe slave-breeding states. Allow me to speak plainly. Although it is\r\nharrowing to your feelings, it is necessary that the facts of the case\r\nshould be stated. We have in the United States slave-breeding states.\r\nThe very state from which the minister from our court to yours comes,\r\nis one of these states—Maryland, where men, women, and children are\r\nreared for the market, just as horses, sheep, and swine are raised for\r\nthe market. Slave-rearing is there looked upon as a legitimate trade;\r\nthe law sanctions it, public opinion upholds it, the church does not\r\ncondemn it. It goes on in all its bloody horrors, sustained by the\r\nauctioneer’s block. If you would see the cruelties of this system, hear\r\nthe following narrative. Not long since the following scene occurred. A\r\nslave-woman and a slaveman had united themselves as man and wife in the\r\nabsence of any law to protect them as man and wife. They had lived\r\ntogether by the permission, not by right, of their master, and they had\r\nreared a family. The master found it expedient, and for his interest,\r\nto sell them. He did not ask them their wishes in regard to the matter\r\nat all; they were not consulted. The man and woman were brought to the\r\nauctioneer’s block, under the sound of the hammer. The cry was raised,\r\n“Here goes; who bids cash?” Think of it—a man and wife to be sold! The\r\nwoman was placed on the auctioneer’s block; her limbs, as is customary,\r\nwere brutally exposed to the purchasers, who examined her with all the\r\nfreedom with which they would examine a horse. There stood the husband,\r\npowerless; no right to his wife; the master’s right preeminent. She was\r\nsold. He was next brought to the auctioneer’s block. His eyes followed\r\nhis wife in the distance; and he looked beseechingly, imploringly, to\r\nthe man that had bought his wife, to buy him also. But he was at length\r\nbid off to another person. He was about to be separated forever from\r\nher he loved. No word of his, no work of his, could save him from this\r\nseparation. He asked permission of his new master to go and take the\r\nhand of his wife at parting. It was denied him. In the agony of his\r\nsoul he rushed from the man who had just bought him, that he might take\r\na farewell of his wife; but his way was obstructed, he was struck over\r\nthe head with a loaded whip, and was held for a moment; but his agony\r\nwas too great. When he was let go, he fell a corpse at the feet of his\r\nmaster. His heart was broken. Such scenes are the everyday fruits of\r\nAmerican slavery. Some two years since, the Hon. Seth. M. Gates, an\r\nanti-slavery gentleman of the state of New York, a representative in\r\nthe congress of the United States, told me he saw with his own eyes the\r\nfollowing circumstances. In the national District of Columbia, over\r\nwhich the star-spangled emblem is constantly waving, where orators are\r\never holding forth on the subject of American liberty, American\r\ndemocracy, American republicanism, there are two slave prisons. When\r\ngoing across a bridge, leading to one of these prisons, he saw a young\r\nwoman run out, bare-footed and bare-headed, and with very little\r\nclothing on. She was running with all speed to the bridge he was\r\napproaching. His eye was fixed upon her, and he stopped to see what was\r\nthe matter. He had not paused long before he saw three men run out\r\nafter her. He now knew what the nature of the case was; a slave\r\nescaping from her chains—a young woman, a sister—escaping from the\r\nbondage in which she had been held. She made her way to the bridge, but\r\nhad not reached, ere from the Virginia side there came two\r\nslaveholders. As soon as they saw them, her pursuers called out, “Stop\r\nher!” True to their Virginian instincts, they came to the rescue of\r\ntheir brother kidnappers, across the bridge. The poor girl now saw that\r\nthere was no chance for her. It was a trying time. She knew if she went\r\nback, she must be a slave forever—she must be dragged down to the\r\nscenes of pollution which the slaveholders continually provide for most\r\nof the poor, sinking, wretched young women, whom they call their\r\nproperty. She formed her resolution; and just as those who were about\r\nto take her, were going to put hands upon her, to drag her back, she\r\nleaped over the balustrades of the bridge, and down she went to rise no\r\nmore. She chose death, rather than to go back into the hands of those\r\nchristian slaveholders from whom she had escaped.\r\n\r\nCan it be possible that such things as these exist in the United\r\nStates? Are not these the exceptions? Are any such scenes as this\r\ngeneral? Are not such deeds condemned by the law and denounced by\r\npublic opinion? Let me read to you a few of the laws of the\r\nslaveholding states of America. I think no better exposure of slavery\r\ncan be made than is made by the laws of the states in which slavery\r\nexists. I prefer reading the laws to making any statement in\r\nconfirmation of what I have said myself; for the slaveholders cannot\r\nobject to this testimony, since it is the calm, the cool, the\r\ndeliberate enactment of their wisest heads, of their most\r\nclear-sighted, their own constituted representatives. “If more than\r\nseven slaves together are found in any road without a white person,\r\ntwenty lashes a piece; for visiting a plantation without a written\r\npass, ten lashes; for letting loose a boat from where it is made fast,\r\nthirty-nine lashes for the first offense; and for the second, shall\r\nhave cut off from his head one ear; for keeping or carrying a club,\r\nthirty-nine lashes; for having any article for sale, without a ticket\r\nfrom his master, ten lashes; for traveling in any other than the most\r\nusual and accustomed road, when going alone to any place, forty lashes;\r\nfor traveling in the night without a pass, forty lashes.” I am afraid\r\nyou do not understand the awful character of these lashes. You must\r\nbring it before your mind. A human being in a perfect state of nudity,\r\ntied hand and foot to a stake, and a strong man standing behind with a\r\nheavy whip, knotted at the end, each blow cutting into the flesh, and\r\nleaving the warm blood dripping to the feet; and for these trifles.\r\n“For being found in another person’s negro-quarters, forty lashes; for\r\nhunting with dogs in the woods, thirty lashes; for being on horseback\r\nwithout the written permission of his master, twenty-five lashes; for\r\nriding or going abroad in the night, or riding horses in the day time,\r\nwithout leave, a slave may be whipped, cropped, or branded in the cheek\r\nwith the letter R. or otherwise punished, such punishment not extending\r\nto life, or so as to render him unfit for labor.” The laws referred to,\r\nmay be found by consulting _Brevard’s Digest; Haywood’s Manual;\r\nVirginia Revised Code; Prince’s Digest; Missouri Laws; Mississippi\r\nRevised Code_. A man, for going to visit his brethren, without the\r\npermission of his master—and in many instances he may not have that\r\npermission; his master, from caprice or other reasons, may not be\r\nwilling to allow it—may be caught on his way, dragged to a post, the\r\nbranding-iron heated, and the name of his master or the letter R\r\nbranded into his cheek or on his forehead. They treat slaves thus, on\r\nthe principle that they must punish for light offenses, in order to\r\nprevent the commission of larger ones. I wish you to mark that in the\r\nsingle state of Virginia there are seventy-one crimes for which a\r\ncolored man may be executed; while there are only three of these\r\ncrimes, which, when committed by a white man, will subject him to that\r\npunishment. There are many of these crimes which if the white man did\r\nnot commit, he would be regarded as a scoundrel and a coward. In the\r\nstate of Maryland, there is a law to this effect: that if a slave shall\r\nstrike his master, he may be hanged, his head severed from his body,\r\nhis body quartered, and his head and quarters set up in the most\r\nprominent places in the neighborhood. If a colored woman, in the\r\ndefense of her own virtue, in defense of her own person, should shield\r\nherself from the brutal attacks of her tyrannical master, or make the\r\nslightest resistance, she may be killed on the spot. No law whatever\r\nwill bring the guilty man to justice for the crime.\r\n\r\nBut you will ask me, can these things be possible in a land professing\r\nChristianity? Yes, they are so; and this is not the worst. No; a darker\r\nfeature is yet to be presented than the mere existence of these facts.\r\nI have to inform you that the religion of the southern states, at this\r\ntime, is the great supporter, the great sanctioner of the bloody\r\natrocities to which I have referred. While America is printing tracts\r\nand bibles; sending missionaries abroad to convert the heathen;\r\nexpending her money in various ways for the promotion of the gospel in\r\nforeign lands—the slave not only lies forgotten, uncared for, but is\r\ntrampled under foot by the very churches of the land. What have we in\r\nAmerica? Why, we have slavery made part of the religion of the land.\r\nYes, the pulpit there stands up as the great defender of this cursed\r\n_institution_, as it is called. Ministers of religion come forward and\r\ntorture the hallowed pages of inspired wisdom to sanction the bloody\r\ndeed. They stand forth as the foremost, the strongest defenders of this\r\n“institution.” As a proof of this, I need not do more than state the\r\ngeneral fact, that slavery has existed under the droppings of the\r\nsanctuary of the south for the last two hundred years, and there has\r\nnot been any war between the _religion_ and the _slavery_ of the south.\r\nWhips, chains, gags, and thumb-screws have all lain under the droppings\r\nof the sanctuary, and instead of rusting from off the limbs of the\r\nbondman, those droppings have served to preserve them in all their\r\nstrength. Instead of preaching the gospel against this tyranny, rebuke,\r\nand wrong, ministers of religion have sought, by all and every means,\r\nto throw in the back-ground whatever in the bible could be construed\r\ninto opposition to slavery, and to bring forward that which they could\r\ntorture into its support. This I conceive to be the darkest feature of\r\nslavery, and the most difficult to attack, because it is identified\r\nwith religion, and exposes those who denounce it to the charge of\r\ninfidelity. Yes, those with whom I have been laboring, namely, the old\r\norganization anti-slavery society of America, have been again and again\r\nstigmatized as infidels, and for what reason? Why, solely in\r\nconsequence of the faithfulness of their attacks upon the slaveholding\r\nreligion of the southern states, and the northern religion that\r\nsympathizes with it. I have found it difficult to speak on this matter\r\nwithout persons coming forward and saying, “Douglass, are you not\r\nafraid of injuring the cause of Christ? You do not desire to do so, we\r\nknow; but are you not undermining religion?” This has been said to me\r\nagain and again, even since I came to this country, but I cannot be\r\ninduced to leave off these exposures. I love the religion of our\r\nblessed Savior. I love that religion that comes from above, in the\r\n“wisdom of God,” which is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy\r\nto be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and\r\nwithout hypocrisy. I love that religion that sends its votaries to bind\r\nup the wounds of him that has fallen among thieves. I love that\r\nreligion that makes it the duty of its disciples to visit the father\r\nless and the widow in their affliction. I love that religion that is\r\nbased upon the glorious principle, of love to God and love to man;\r\nwhich makes its followers do unto others as they themselves would be\r\ndone by. If you demand liberty to yourself, it says, grant it to your\r\nneighbors. If you claim a right to think for yourself, it says, allow\r\nyour neighbors the same right. If you claim to act for yourself, it\r\nsays, allow your neighbors the same right. It is because I love this\r\nreligion that I hate the slaveholding, the woman-whipping, the\r\nmind-darkening, the soul-destroying religion that exists in the\r\nsouthern states of America. It is because I regard the one as good, and\r\npure, and holy, that I cannot but regard the other as bad, corrupt, and\r\nwicked. Loving the one I must hate the other; holding to the one I must\r\nreject the other.\r\n\r\nI may be asked, why I am so anxious to bring this subject before the\r\nBritish public—why I do not confine my efforts to the United States? My\r\nanswer is, first, that slavery is the common enemy of mankind, and all\r\nmankind should be made acquainted with its abominable character. My\r\nnext answer is, that the slave is a man, and, as such, is entitled to\r\nyour sympathy as a brother. All the feelings, all the susceptibilities,\r\nall the capacities, which you have, he has. He is a part of the human\r\nfamily. He has been the prey—the common prey—of Christendom for the\r\nlast three hundred years, and it is but right, it is but just, it is\r\nbut proper, that his wrongs should be known throughout the world. I\r\nhave another reason for bringing this matter before the British public,\r\nand it is this: slavery is a system of wrong, so blinding to all\r\naround, so hardening to the heart, so corrupting to the morals, so\r\ndeleterious to religion, so sapping to all the principles of justice in\r\nits immediate vicinity, that the community surrounding it lack the\r\nmoral stamina necessary to its removal. It is a system of such gigantic\r\nevil, so strong, so overwhelming in its power, that no one nation is\r\nequal to its removal. It requires the humanity of Christianity, the\r\nmorality of the world to remove it. Hence, I call upon the people of\r\nBritain to look at this matter, and to exert the influence I am about\r\nto show they possess, for the removal of slavery from America. I can\r\nappeal to them, as strongly by their regard for the slaveholder as for\r\nthe slave, to labor in this cause. I am here, because you have an\r\ninfluence on America that no other nation can have. You have been drawn\r\ntogether by the power of steam to a marvelous extent; the distance\r\nbetween London and Boston is now reduced to some twelve or fourteen\r\ndays, so that the denunciations against slavery, uttered in London this\r\nweek, may be heard in a fortnight in the streets of Boston, and\r\nreverberating amidst the hills of Massachusetts. There is nothing said\r\nhere against slavery that will not be recorded in the United States. I\r\nam here, also, because the slaveholders do not want me to be here; they\r\nwould rather that I were not here. I have adopted a maxim laid down by\r\nNapoleon, never to occupy ground which the enemy would like me to\r\noccupy. The slaveholders would much rather have me, if I will denounce\r\nslavery, denounce it in the northern states, where their friends and\r\nsupporters are, who will stand by and mob me for denouncing it. They\r\nfeel something as the man felt, when he uttered his prayer, in which he\r\nmade out a most horrible case for himself, and one of his neighbors\r\ntouched him and said, “My friend, I always had the opinion of you that\r\nyou have now expressed for yourself—that you are a very great sinner.”\r\nComing from himself, it was all very well, but coming from a stranger\r\nit was rather cutting. The slaveholders felt that when slavery was\r\ndenounced among themselves, it was not so bad; but let one of the\r\nslaves get loose, let him summon the people of Britain, and make known\r\nto them the conduct of the slaveholders toward their slaves, and it\r\ncuts them to the quick, and produces a sensation such as would be\r\nproduced by nothing else. The power I exert now is something like the\r\npower that is exerted by the man at the end of the lever; my influence\r\nnow is just in proportion to the distance that I am from the United\r\nStates. My exposure of slavery abroad will tell more upon the hearts\r\nand consciences of slaveholders, than if I was attacking them in\r\nAmerica; for almost every paper that I now receive from the United\r\nStates, comes teeming with statements about this fugitive Negro,\r\ncalling him a “glib-tongued scoundrel,” and saying that he is running\r\nout against the institutions and people of America. I deny the charge\r\nthat I am saying a word against the institutions of America, or the\r\npeople, as such. What I have to say is against slavery and\r\nslaveholders. I feel at liberty to speak on this subject. I have on my\r\nback the marks of the lash; I have four sisters and one brother now\r\nunder the galling chain. I feel it my duty to cry aloud and spare not.\r\nI am not averse to having the good opinion of my fellow creatures. I am\r\nnot averse to being kindly regarded by all men; but I am bound, even at\r\nthe hazard of making a large class of religionists in this country hate\r\nme, oppose me, and malign me as they have done—I am bound by the\r\nprayers, and tears, and entreaties of three millions of kneeling\r\nbondsmen, to have no compromise with men who are in any shape or form\r\nconnected with the slaveholders of America. I expose slavery in this\r\ncountry, because to expose it is to kill it. Slavery is one of those\r\nmonsters of darkness to whom the light of truth is death. Expose\r\nslavery, and it dies. Light is to slavery what the heat of the sun is\r\nto the root of a tree; it must die under it. All the slaveholder asks\r\nof me is silence. He does not ask me to go abroad and preach _in favor_\r\nof slavery; he does not ask any one to do that. He would not say that\r\nslavery is a good thing, but the best under the circumstances. The\r\nslaveholders want total darkness on the subject. They want the hatchway\r\nshut down, that the monster may crawl in his den of darkness, crushing\r\nhuman hopes and happiness, destroying the bondman at will, and having\r\nno one to reprove or rebuke him. Slavery shrinks from the light; it\r\nhateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest its deeds should be\r\nreproved. To tear off the mask from this abominable system, to expose\r\nit to the light of heaven, aye, to the heat of the sun, that it may\r\nburn and wither it out of existence, is my object in coming to this\r\ncountry. I want the slaveholder surrounded, as by a wall of\r\nanti-slavery fire, so that he may see the condemnation of himself and\r\nhis system glaring down in letters of light. I want him to feel that he\r\nhas no sympathy in England, Scotland, or Ireland; that he has none in\r\nCanada, none in Mexico, none among the poor wild Indians; that the\r\nvoice of the civilized, aye, and savage world is against him. I would\r\nhave condemnation blaze down upon him in every direction, till, stunned\r\nand overwhelmed with shame and confusion, he is compelled to let go the\r\ngrasp he holds upon the persons of his victims, and restore them to\r\ntheir long-lost rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell’s Reply\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Rev. Dr. Campbell’s brilliant reply we extract the following:\r\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS, “the beast of burden,” the portion of “goods and\r\nchattels,” the representative of three millions of men, has been raised\r\nup! Shall I say the _man?_ If there is a man on earth, he is a man. My\r\nblood boiled within me when I heard his address tonight, and thought\r\nthat he had left behind him three millions of such men.\r\n\r\nWe must see more of this man; we must have more of this man. One would\r\nhave taken a voyage round the globe some forty years back—especially\r\nsince the introduction of steam—to have heard such an exposure of\r\nslavery from the lips of a slave. It will be an era in the individual\r\nhistory of the present assembly. Our children—our boys and girls—I have\r\ntonight seen the delightful sympathy of their hearts evinced by their\r\nheaving breasts, while their eyes sparkled with wonder and admiration,\r\nthat this black man—this slave—had so much logic, so much wit, so much\r\nfancy, so much eloquence. He was something more than a man, according\r\nto their little notions. Then, I say, we must hear him again. We have\r\ngot a purpose to accomplish. He has appealed to the pulpit of England.\r\nThe English pulpit is with him. He has appealed to the press of\r\nEngland; the press of England is conducted by English hearts, and that\r\npress will do him justice. About ten days hence, and his second master,\r\nwho may well prize “such a piece of goods,” will have the pleasure of\r\nreading his burning words, and his first master will bless himself that\r\nhe has got quit of him. We have to create public opinion, or rather,\r\nnot to create it, for it is created already; but we have to foster it;\r\nand when tonight I heard those magnificent words—the words of Curran,\r\nby which my heart, from boyhood, has ofttimes been deeply moved—I\r\nrejoice to think that they embody an instinct of an Englishman’s\r\nnature. I heard, with inexpressible delight, how they told on this\r\nmighty mass of the citizens of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nBritain has now no slaves; we can therefore talk to the other nations\r\nnow, as we could not have talked a dozen years ago. I want the whole of\r\nthe London ministry to meet Douglass. For as his appeal is to England,\r\nand throughout England, I should rejoice in the idea of churchmen and\r\ndissenters merging all sectional distinctions in this cause. Let us\r\nhave a public breakfast. Let the ministers meet him; let them hear him;\r\nlet them grasp his hand; and let him enlist their sympathies on behalf\r\nof the slave. Let him inspire them with abhorrence of the\r\nman-stealer—the slaveholder. No slaveholding American shall ever my\r\ncross my door. No slaveholding or slavery-supporting minister shall\r\never pollute my pulpit. While I have a tongue to speak, or a hand to\r\nwrite, I will, to the utmost of my power, oppose these slaveholding\r\nmen. We must have Douglass amongst us to aid in fostering public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe great conflict with slavery must now take place in America; and\r\nwhile they are adding other slave states to the Union, our business is\r\nto step forward and help the abolitionists there. It is a pleasing\r\ncircumstance that such a body of men has risen in America, and whilst\r\nwe hurl our thunders against her slavers, let us make a distinction\r\nbetween those who advocate slavery and those who oppose it. George\r\nThompson has been there. This man, Frederick Douglass, has been there,\r\nand has been compelled to flee. I wish, when he first set foot on our\r\nshores, he had made a solemn vow, and said, “Now that I am free, and in\r\nthe sanctuary of freedom, I will never return till I have seen the\r\nemancipation of my country completed.” He wants to surround these men,\r\nthe slaveholders, as by a wall of fire; and he himself may do much\r\ntoward kindling it. Let him travel over the island—east, west, north,\r\nand south—everywhere diffusing knowledge and awakening principle, till\r\nthe whole nation become a body of petitioners to America. He will, he\r\nmust, do it. He must for a season make England his home. He must send\r\nfor his wife. He must send for his children. I want to see the sons and\r\ndaughters of such a sire. We, too, must do something for him and them\r\nworthy of the English name. I do not like the idea of a man of such\r\nmental dimensions, such moral courage, and all but incomparable talent,\r\nhaving his own small wants, and the wants of a distant wife and\r\nchildren, supplied by the poor profits of his publication, the sketch\r\nof his life. Let the pamphlet be bought by tens of thousands. But we\r\nwill do something more for him, shall we not?\r\n\r\nIt only remains that we pass a resolution of thanks to Frederick\r\nDouglass, the slave that was, the man that is! He that was covered with\r\nchains, and that is now being covered with glory, and whom we will send\r\nback a gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO HIS OLD MASTER. 11. To My Old Master, Thomas Auld\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR—The long and intimate, though by no means friendly, relation which\r\nunhappily subsisted between you and myself, leads me to hope that you\r\nwill easily account for the great liberty which I now take in\r\naddressing you in this open and public manner. The same fact may remove\r\nany disagreeable surprise which you may experience on again finding\r\nyour name coupled with mine, in any other way than in an advertisement,\r\naccurately describing my person, and offering a large sum for my\r\narrest. In thus dragging you again before the public, I am aware that I\r\nshall subject myself to no inconsiderable amount of censure. I shall\r\nprobably be charged with an unwarrantable, if not a wanton and reckless\r\ndisregard of the rights and properties of private life. There are those\r\nnorth as well as south who entertain a much higher respect for rights\r\nwhich are merely conventional, than they do for rights which are\r\npersonal and essential. Not a few there are in our country, who, while\r\nthey have no scruples against robbing the laborer of the hard earned\r\nresults of his patient industry, will be shocked by the extremely\r\nindelicate manner of bringing your name before the public. Believing\r\nthis to be the case, and wishing to meet every reasonable or plausible\r\nobjection to my conduct, I will frankly state the ground upon which I\r\njustfy(sic) myself in this instance, as well as on former occasions\r\nwhen I have thought proper to mention your name in public. All will\r\nagree that a man guilty of theft, robbery, or murder, has forfeited the\r\nright to concealment and private life; that the community have a right\r\nto subject such persons to the most complete exposure. However much\r\nthey may desire retirement, and aim to conceal themselves and their\r\nmovements from the popular gaze, the public have a right to ferret them\r\nout, and bring their conduct before the proper tribunals of the country\r\nfor investigation. Sir, you will undoubtedly make the proper\r\napplication of these generally admitted principles, and will easily see\r\nthe light in which you are regarded by me; I will not therefore\r\nmanifest ill temper, by calling you hard names. I know you to be a man\r\nof some intelligence, and can readily determine the precise estimate\r\nwhich I entertain of your character. I may therefore indulge in\r\nlanguage which may seem to others indirect and ambiguous, and yet be\r\nquite well understood by yourself.\r\n\r\nI have selected this day on which to address you, because it is the\r\nanniversary of my emancipation; and knowing no better way, I am led to\r\nthis as the best mode of celebrating that truly important events. Just\r\nten years ago this beautiful September morning, yon bright sun beheld\r\nme a slave—a poor degraded chattel—trembling at the sound of your\r\nvoice, lamenting that I was a man, and wishing myself a brute. The\r\nhopes which I had treasured up for weeks of a safe and successful\r\nescape from your grasp, were powerfully confronted at this last hour by\r\ndark clouds of doubt and fear, making my person shake and my bosom to\r\nheave with the heavy contest between hope and fear. I have no words to\r\ndescribe to you the deep agony of soul which I experienced on that\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten morning—for I left by daylight. I was making a\r\nleap in the dark. The probabilities, so far as I could by reason\r\ndetermine them, were stoutly against the undertaking. The preliminaries\r\nand precautions I had adopted previously, all worked badly. I was like\r\none going to war without weapons—ten chances of defeat to one of\r\nvictory. One in whom I had confided, and one who had promised me\r\nassistance, appalled by fear at the trial hour, deserted me, thus\r\nleaving the responsibility of success or failure solely with myself.\r\nYou, sir, can never know my feelings. As I look back to them, I can\r\nscarcely realize that I have passed through a scene so trying. Trying,\r\nhowever, as they were, and gloomy as was the prospect, thanks be to the\r\nMost High, who is ever the God of the oppressed, at the moment which\r\nwas to determine my whole earthly career, His grace was sufficient; my\r\nmind was made up. I embraced the golden opportunity, took the morning\r\ntide at the flood, and a free man, young, active, and strong, is the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nI have often thought I should like to explain to you the grounds upon\r\nwhich I have justified myself in running away from you. I am almost\r\nashamed to do so now, for by this time you may have discovered them\r\nyourself. I will, however, glance at them. When yet but a child about\r\nsix years old, I imbibed the determination to run away. The very first\r\nmental effort that I now remember on my part, was an attempt to solve\r\nthe mystery—why am I a slave? and with this question my youthful mind\r\nwas troubled for many days, pressing upon me more heavily at times than\r\nothers. When I saw the slave-driver whip a slave-woman, cut the blood\r\nout of her neck, and heard her piteous cries, I went away into the\r\ncorner of the fence, wept and pondered over the mystery. I had, through\r\nsome medium, I know not what, got some idea of God, the Creator of all\r\nmankind, the black and the white, and that he had made the blacks to\r\nserve the whites as slaves. How he could do this and be _good_, I could\r\nnot tell. I was not satisfied with this theory, which made God\r\nresponsible for slavery, for it pained me greatly, and I have wept over\r\nit long and often. At one time, your first wife, Mrs. Lucretia, heard\r\nme sighing and saw me shedding tears, and asked of me the matter, but I\r\nwas afraid to tell her. I was puzzled with this question, till one\r\nnight while sitting in the kitchen, I heard some of the old slaves\r\ntalking of their parents having been stolen from Africa by white men,\r\nand were sold here as slaves. The whole mystery was solved at once.\r\nVery soon after this, my Aunt Jinny and Uncle Noah ran away, and the\r\ngreat noise made about it by your father-in-law, made me for the first\r\ntime acquainted with the fact, that there were free states as well as\r\nslave states. From that time, I resolved that I would some day run\r\naway. The morality of the act I dispose of as follows: I am myself; you\r\nare yourself; we are two distinct persons, equal persons. What you are,\r\nI am. You are a man, and so am I. God created both, and made us\r\nseparate beings. I am not by nature bond to you, or you to me. Nature\r\ndoes not make your existence depend upon me, or mine to depend upon\r\nyours. I cannot walk upon your legs, or you upon mine. I cannot breathe\r\nfor you, or you for me; I must breathe for myself, and you for\r\nyourself. We are distinct persons, and are each equally provided with\r\nfaculties necessary to our individual existence. In leaving you, I took\r\nnothing but what belonged to me, and in no way lessened your means for\r\nobtaining an _honest_ living. Your faculties remained yours, and mine\r\nbecame useful to their rightful owner. I therefore see no wrong in any\r\npart of the transaction. It is true, I went off secretly; but that was\r\nmore your fault than mine. Had I let you into the secret, you would\r\nhave defeated the enterprise entirely; but for this, I should have been\r\nreally glad to have made you acquainted with my intentions to leave.\r\n\r\nYou may perhaps want to know how I like my present condition. I am free\r\nto say, I greatly prefer it to that which I occupied in Maryland. I am,\r\nhowever, by no means prejudiced against the state as such. Its\r\ngeography, climate, fertility, and products, are such as to make it a\r\nvery desirable abode for any man; and but for the existence of slavery\r\nthere, it is not impossible that I might again take up my abode in that\r\nstate. It is not that I love Maryland less, but freedom more. You will\r\nbe surprised to learn that people at the north labor under the strange\r\ndelusion that if the slaves were emancipated at the south, they would\r\nflock to the north. So far from this being the case, in that event, you\r\nwould see many old and familiar faces back again to the south. The fact\r\nis, there are few here who would not return to the south in the event\r\nof emancipation. We want to live in the land of our birth, and to lay\r\nour bones by the side of our fathers; and nothing short of an intense\r\nlove of personal freedom keeps us from the south. For the sake of this,\r\nmost of us would live on a crust of bread and a cup of cold water.\r\n\r\nSince I left you, I have had a rich experience. I have occupied\r\nstations which I never dreamed of when a slave. Three out of the ten\r\nyears since I left you, I spent as a common laborer on the wharves of\r\nNew Bedford, Massachusetts. It was there I earned my first free dollar.\r\nIt was mine. I could spend it as I pleased. I could buy hams or herring\r\nwith it, without asking any odds of anybody. That was a precious dollar\r\nto me. You remember when I used to make seven, or eight, or even nine\r\ndollars a week in Baltimore, you would take every cent of it from me\r\nevery Saturday night, saying that I belonged to you, and my earnings\r\nalso. I never liked this conduct on your part—to say the best, I\r\nthought it a little mean. I would not have served you so. But let that\r\npass. I was a little awkward about counting money in New England\r\nfashion when I first landed in New Bedford. I came near betraying\r\nmyself several times. I caught myself saying phip, for fourpence; and\r\nat one time a man actually charged me with being a runaway, whereupon I\r\nwas silly enough to become one by running away from him, for I was\r\ngreatly afraid he might adopt measures to get me again into slavery, a\r\ncondition I then dreaded more than death.\r\n\r\nI soon learned, however, to count money, as well as to make it, and got\r\non swimmingly. I married soon after leaving you; in fact, I was engaged\r\nto be married before I left you; and instead of finding my companion a\r\nburden, she was truly a helpmate. She went to live at service, and I to\r\nwork on the wharf, and though we toiled hard the first winter, we never\r\nlived more happily. After remaining in New Bedford for three years, I\r\nmet with William Lloyd Garrison, a person of whom you have _possibly_\r\nheard, as he is pretty generally known among slaveholders. He put it\r\ninto my head that I might make myself serviceable to the cause of the\r\nslave, by devoting a portion of my time to telling my own sorrows, and\r\nthose of other slaves, which had come under my observation. This was\r\nthe commencement of a higher state of existence than any to which I had\r\never aspired. I was thrown into society the most pure, enlightened, and\r\nbenevolent, that the country affords. Among these I have never\r\nforgotten you, but have invariably made you the topic of\r\nconversation—thus giving you all the notoriety I could do. I need not\r\ntell you that the opinion formed of you in these circles is far from\r\nbeing favorable. They have little respect for your honesty, and less\r\nfor your religion.\r\n\r\nBut I was going on to relate to you something of my interesting\r\nexperience. I had not long enjoyed the excellent society to which I\r\nhave referred, before the light of its excellence exerted a beneficial\r\ninfluence on my mind and heart. Much of my early dislike of white\r\npersons was removed, and their manners, habits, and customs, so\r\nentirely unlike what I had been used to in the kitchen-quarters on the\r\nplantations of the south, fairly charmed me, and gave me a strong\r\ndisrelish for the coarse and degrading customs of my former condition.\r\nI therefore made an effort so to improve my mind and deportment, as to\r\nbe somewhat fitted to the station to which I seemed almost\r\nprovidentially called. The transition from degradation to\r\nrespectability was indeed great, and to get from one to the other\r\nwithout carrying some marks of one’s former condition, is truly a\r\ndifficult matter. I would not have you think that I am now entirely\r\nclear of all plantation peculiarities, but my friends here, while they\r\nentertain the strongest dislike to them, regard me with that charity to\r\nwhich my past life somewhat entitles me, so that my condition in this\r\nrespect is exceedingly pleasant. So far as my domestic affairs are\r\nconcerned, I can boast of as comfortable a dwelling as your own. I have\r\nan industrious and neat companion, and four dear children—the oldest a\r\ngirl of nine years, and three fine boys, the oldest eight, the next\r\nsix, and the youngest four years old. The three oldest are now going\r\nregularly to school—two can read and write, and the other can spell,\r\nwith tolerable correctness, words of two syllables. Dear fellows! they\r\nare all in comfortable beds, and are sound asleep, perfectly secure\r\nunder my own roof. There are no slaveholders here to rend my heart by\r\nsnatching them from my arms, or blast a mother’s dearest hopes by\r\ntearing them from her bosom. These dear children are ours—not to work\r\nup into rice, sugar, and tobacco, but to watch over, regard, and\r\nprotect, and to rear them up in the nurture and admonition of the\r\ngospel—to train them up in the paths of wisdom and virtue, and, as far\r\nas we can, to make them useful to the world and to themselves. Oh! sir,\r\na slaveholder never appears to me so completely an agent of hell, as\r\nwhen I think of and look upon my dear children. It is then that my\r\nfeelings rise above my control. I meant to have said more with respect\r\nto my own prosperity and happiness, but thoughts and feelings which\r\nthis recital has quickened, unfit me to proceed further in that\r\ndirection. The grim horrors of slavery rise in all their ghastly terror\r\nbefore me; the wails of millions pierce my heart and chill my blood. I\r\nremember the chain, the gag, the bloody whip; the death-like gloom\r\novershadowing the broken spirit of the fettered bondman; the appalling\r\nliability of his being torn away from wife and children, and sold like\r\na beast in the market. Say not that this is a picture of fancy. You\r\nwell know that I wear stripes on my back, inflicted by your direction;\r\nand that you, while we were brothers in the same church, caused this\r\nright hand, with which I am now penning this letter, to be closely tied\r\nto my left, and my person dragged, at the pistol’s mouth, fifteen\r\nmiles, from the Bay Side to Easton, to be sold like a beast in the\r\nmarket, for the alleged crime of intending to escape from your\r\npossession. All this, and more, you remember, and know to be perfectly\r\ntrue, not only of yourself, but of nearly all of the slaveholders\r\naround you.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, you are probably the guilty holder of at least three of\r\nmy own dear sisters, and my only brother, in bondage. These you regard\r\nas your property. They are recorded on your ledger, or perhaps have\r\nbeen sold to human flesh-mongers, with a view to filling our own\r\never-hungry purse. Sir, I desire to know how and where these dear\r\nsisters are. Have you sold them? or are they still in your possession?\r\nWhat has become of them? are they living or dead? And my dear old\r\ngrandmother, whom you turned out like an old horse to die in the\r\nwoods—is she still alive? Write and let me know all about them. If my\r\ngrandmother be still alive, she is of no service to you, for by this\r\ntime she must be nearly eighty years old—too old to be cared for by one\r\nto whom she has ceased to be of service; send her to me at Rochester,\r\nor bring her to Philadelphia, and it shall be the crowning happiness of\r\nmy life to take care of her in her old age. Oh! she was to me a mother\r\nand a father, so far as hard toil for my comfort could make her such.\r\nSend me my grandmother! that I may watch over and take care of her in\r\nher old age. And my sisters—let me know all about them. I would write\r\nto them, and learn all I want to know of them, without disturbing you\r\nin any way, but that, through your unrighteous conduct, they have been\r\nentirely deprived of the power to read and write. You have kept them in\r\nutter ignorance, and have therefore robbed them of the sweet enjoyments\r\nof writing or receiving letters from absent friends and relatives. Your\r\nwickedness and cruelty, committed in this respect on your\r\nfellow-creatures, are greater than all the stripes you have laid upon\r\nmy back or theirs. It is an outrage upon the soul, a war upon the\r\nimmortal spirit, and one for which you must give account at the bar of\r\nour common Father and Creator.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility which you have assumed in this regard is truly\r\nawful, and how you could stagger under it these many years is\r\nmarvelous. Your mind must have become darkened, your heart hardened,\r\nyour conscience seared and petrified, or you would have long since\r\nthrown off the accursed load, and sought relief at the hands of a\r\nsin-forgiving God. How, let me ask, would you look upon me, were I,\r\nsome dark night, in company with a band of hardened villains, to enter\r\nthe precincts of your elegant dwelling, and seize the person of your\r\nown lovely daughter, Amanda, and carry her off from your family,\r\nfriends, and all the loved ones of her youth—make her my slave—compel\r\nher to work, and I take her wages—place her name on my ledger as\r\nproperty—disregard her personal rights—fetter the powers of her\r\nimmortal soul by denying her the right and privilege of learning to\r\nread and write—feed her coarsely—clothe her scantily, and whip her on\r\nthe naked back occasionally; more, and still more horrible, leave her\r\nunprotected—a degraded victim to the brutal lust of fiendish overseers,\r\nwho would pollute, blight, and blast her fair soul—rob her of all\r\ndignity—destroy her virtue, and annihilate in her person all the graces\r\nthat adorn the character of virtuous womanhood? I ask, how would you\r\nregard me, if such were my conduct? Oh! the vocabulary of the damned\r\nwould not afford a word sufficiently infernal to express your idea of\r\nmy God-provoking wickedness. Yet, sir, your treatment of my beloved\r\nsisters is in all essential points precisely like the case I have now\r\nsupposed. Damning as would be such a deed on my part, it would be no\r\nmore so than that which you have committed against me and my sisters.\r\n\r\nI will now bring this letter to a close; you shall hear from me again\r\nunless you let me hear from you. I intend to make use of you as a\r\nweapon with which to assail the system of slavery—as a means of\r\nconcentrating public attention on the system, and deepening the horror\r\nof trafficking in the souls and bodies of men. I shall make use of you\r\nas a means of exposing the character of the American church and\r\nclergy—and as a means of bringing this guilty nation, with yourself, to\r\nrepentance. In doing this, I entertain no malice toward you personally.\r\nThere is no roof under which you would be more safe than mine, and\r\nthere is nothing in my house which you might need for your comfort,\r\nwhich I would not readily grant. Indeed, I should esteem it a privilege\r\nto set you an example as to how mankind ought to treat each other.\r\n\r\nI am your fellow-man, but not your slave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF SLAVERY. Extract from a Lecture on Slavery, at Rochester,\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 1, 1850\r\n\r\nMore than twenty years of my life were consumed in a state of slavery.\r\nMy childhood was environed by the baneful peculiarities of the slave\r\nsystem. I grew up to manhood in the presence of this hydra headed\r\nmonster—not as a master—not as an idle spectator—not as the guest of\r\nthe slaveholder—but as A SLAVE, eating the bread and drinking the cup\r\nof slavery with the most degraded of my brother-bondmen, and sharing\r\nwith them all the painful conditions of their wretched lot. In\r\nconsideration of these facts, I feel that I have a right to speak, and\r\nto speak _strongly_. Yet, my friends, I feel bound to speak truly.\r\n\r\nGoading as have been the cruelties to which I have been\r\nsubjected—bitter as have been the trials through which I have\r\npassed—exasperating as have been, and still are, the indignities\r\noffered to my manhood—I find in them no excuse for the slightest\r\ndeparture from truth in dealing with any branch of this subject.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I will state, as well as I can, the legal and social\r\nrelation of master and slave. A master is one—to speak in the\r\nvocabulary of the southern states—who claims and exercises a right of\r\nproperty in the person of a fellow-man. This he does with the force of\r\nthe law and the sanction of southern religion. The law gives the master\r\nabsolute power over the slave. He may work him, flog him, hire him out,\r\nsell him, and, in certain contingencies, _kill_ him, with perfect\r\nimpunity. The slave is a human being, divested of all rights—reduced to\r\nthe level of a brute—a mere “chattel” in the eye of the law—placed\r\nbeyond the circle of human brotherhood—cut off from his kind—his name,\r\nwhich the “recording angel” may have enrolled in heaven, among the\r\nblest, is impiously inserted in a _master’s ledger_, with horses,\r\nsheep, and swine. In law, the slave has no wife, no children, no\r\ncountry, and no home. He can own nothing, possess nothing, acquire\r\nnothing, but what must belong to another. To eat the fruit of his own\r\ntoil, to clothe his person with the work of his own hands, is\r\nconsidered stealing. He toils that another may reap the fruit; he is\r\nindustrious that another may live in idleness; he eats unbolted meal\r\nthat another may eat the bread of fine flour; he labors in chains at\r\nhome, under a burning sun and biting lash, that another may ride in\r\nease and splendor abroad; he lives in ignorance that another may be\r\neducated; he is abused that another may be exalted; he rests his\r\ntoil-worn limbs on the cold, damp ground that another may repose on the\r\nsoftest pillow; he is clad in coarse and tattered raiment that another\r\nmay be arrayed in purple and fine linen; he is sheltered only by the\r\nwretched hovel that a master may dwell in a magnificent mansion; and to\r\nthis condition he is bound down as by an arm of iron.\r\n\r\nFrom this monstrous relation there springs an unceasing stream of most\r\nrevolting cruelties. The very accompaniments of the slave system stamp\r\nit as the offspring of hell itself. To ensure good behavior, the\r\nslaveholder relies on the whip; to induce proper humility, he relies on\r\nthe whip; to rebuke what he is pleased to term insolence, he relies on\r\nthe whip; to supply the place of wages as an incentive to toil, he\r\nrelies on the whip; to bind down the spirit of the slave, to imbrute\r\nand destroy his manhood, he relies on the whip, the chain, the gag, the\r\nthumb-screw, the pillory, the bowie knife the pistol, and the\r\nblood-hound. These are the necessary and unvarying accompaniments of\r\nthe system. Wherever slavery is found, these horrid instruments are\r\nalso found. Whether on the coast of Africa, among the savage tribes, or\r\nin South Carolina, among the refined and civilized, slavery is the\r\nsame, and its accompaniments one and the same. It makes no difference\r\nwhether the slaveholder worships the God of the Christians, or is a\r\nfollower of Mahomet, he is the minister of the same cruelty, and the\r\nauthor of the same misery. _Slavery_ is always _slavery;_ always the\r\nsame foul, haggard, and damning scourge, whether found in the eastern\r\nor in the western hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThere is a still deeper shade to be given to this picture. The physical\r\ncruelties are indeed sufficiently harassing and revolting; but they are\r\nas a few grains of sand on the sea shore, or a few drops of water in\r\nthe great ocean, compared with the stupendous wrongs which it inflicts\r\nupon the mental, moral, and religious nature of its hapless victims. It\r\nis only when we contemplate the slave as a moral and intellectual\r\nbeing, that we can adequately comprehend the unparalleled enormity of\r\nslavery, and the intense criminality of the slaveholder. I have said\r\nthat the slave was a man. “What a piece of work is man! How noble in\r\nreason! How infinite in faculties! In form and moving how express and\r\nadmirable! In action how like an angel! In apprehension how like a God!\r\nThe beauty of the world! The paragon of animals!”\r\n\r\nThe slave is a man, “the image of God,” but “a little lower than the\r\nangels;” possessing a soul, eternal and indestructible; capable of\r\nendless happiness, or immeasurable woe; a creature of hopes and fears,\r\nof affections and passions, of joys and sorrows, and he is endowed with\r\nthose mysterious powers by which man soars above the things of time and\r\nsense, and grasps, with undying tenacity, the elevating and sublimely\r\nglorious idea of a God. It is _such_ a being that is smitten and\r\nblasted. The first work of slavery is to mar and deface those\r\ncharacteristics of its victims which distinguish _men_ from _things_,\r\nand _persons_ from _property_. Its first aim is to destroy all sense of\r\nhigh moral and religious responsibility. It reduces man to a mere\r\nmachine. It cuts him off from his Maker, it hides from him the laws of\r\nGod, and leaves him to grope his way from time to eternity in the dark,\r\nunder the arbitrary and despotic control of a frail, depraved, and\r\nsinful fellow-man. As the serpent-charmer of India is compelled to\r\nextract the deadly teeth of his venomous prey before he is able to\r\nhandle him with impunity, so the slaveholder must strike down the\r\nconscience of the slave before he can obtain the entire mastery over\r\nhis victim.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, the first business of the enslaver of men to blunt,\r\ndeaden, and destroy the central principle of human responsibility.\r\nConscience is, to the individual soul, and to society, what the law of\r\ngravitation is to the universe. It holds society together; it is the\r\nbasis of all trust and confidence; it is the pillar of all moral\r\nrectitude. Without it, suspicion would take the place of trust; vice\r\nwould be more than a match for virtue; men would prey upon each other,\r\nlike the wild beasts of the desert; and earth would become a _hell_.\r\n\r\nNor is slavery more adverse to the conscience than it is to the mind.\r\nThis is shown by the fact, that in every state of the American Union,\r\nwhere slavery exists, except the state of Kentucky, there are laws\r\nabsolutely prohibitory of education among the slaves. The crime of\r\nteaching a slave to read is punishable with severe fines and\r\nimprisonment, and, in some instances, with _death itself_.\r\n\r\nNor are the laws respecting this matter a dead letter. Cases may occur\r\nin which they are disregarded, and a few instances may be found where\r\nslaves may have learned to read; but such are isolated cases, and only\r\nprove the rule. The great mass of slaveholders look upon education\r\namong the slaves as utterly subversive of the slave system. I well\r\nremember when my mistress first announced to my master that she had\r\ndiscovered that I could read. His face colored at once with surprise\r\nand chagrin. He said that “I was ruined, and my value as a slave\r\ndestroyed; that a slave should know nothing but to obey his master;\r\nthat to give a negro an inch would lead him to take an ell; that having\r\nlearned how to read, I would soon want to know how to write; and that\r\nby-and-by I would be running away.” I think my audience will bear\r\nwitness to the correctness of this philosophy, and to the literal\r\nfulfillment of this prophecy.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly well understood at the south, that to educate a slave\r\nis to make him discontened(sic) with slavery, and to invest him with a\r\npower which shall open to him the treasures of freedom; and since the\r\nobject of the slaveholder is to maintain complete authority over his\r\nslave, his constant vigilance is exercised to prevent everything which\r\nmilitates against, or endangers, the stability of his authority.\r\nEducation being among the menacing influences, and, perhaps, the most\r\ndangerous, is, therefore, the most cautiously guarded against.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we do not often hear of the enforcement of the law,\r\npunishing as a crime the teaching of slaves to read, but this is not\r\nbecause of a want of disposition to enforce it. The true reason or\r\nexplanation of the matter is this: there is the greatest unanimity of\r\nopinion among the white population in the south in favor of the policy\r\nof keeping the slave in ignorance. There is, perhaps, another reason\r\nwhy the law against education is so seldom violated. The slave is too\r\npoor to be able to offer a temptation sufficiently strong to induce a\r\nwhite man to violate it; and it is not to be supposed that in a\r\ncommunity where the moral and religious sentiment is in favor of\r\nslavery, many martyrs will be found sacrificing their liberty and lives\r\nby violating those prohibitory enactments.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, then, darkness reigns over the abodes of the\r\nenslaved, and “how great is that darkness!”\r\n\r\nWe are sometimes told of the contentment of the slaves, and are\r\nentertained with vivid pictures of their happiness. We are told that\r\nthey often dance and sing; that their masters frequently give them\r\nwherewith to make merry; in fine, that they have little of which to\r\ncomplain. I admit that the slave does sometimes sing, dance, and appear\r\nto be merry. But what does this prove? It only proves to my mind, that\r\nthough slavery is armed with a thousand stings, it is not able entirely\r\nto kill the elastic spirit of the bondman. That spirit will rise and\r\nwalk abroad, despite of whips and chains, and extract from the cup of\r\nnature occasional drops of joy and gladness. No thanks to the\r\nslaveholder, nor to slavery, that the vivacious captive may sometimes\r\ndance in his chains; his very mirth in such circumstances stands before\r\nGod as an accusing angel against his enslaver.\r\n\r\nIt is often said, by the opponents of the anti-slavery cause, that the\r\ncondition of the people of Ireland is more deplorable than that of the\r\nAmerican slaves. Far be it from me to underrate the sufferings of the\r\nIrish people. They have been long oppressed; and the same heart that\r\nprompts me to plead the cause of the American bondman, makes it\r\nimpossible for me not to sympathize with the oppressed of all lands.\r\nYet I must say that there is no analogy between the two cases. The\r\nIrishman is poor, but he is not a slave. He may be in rags, but he is\r\nnot a slave. He is still the master of his own body, and can say with\r\nthe poet, “The hand of Douglass is his own.” “The world is all before\r\nhim, where to choose;” and poor as may be my opinion of the British\r\nparliament, I cannot believe that it will ever sink to such a depth of\r\ninfamy as to pass a law for the recapture of fugitive Irishmen! The\r\nshame and scandal of kidnapping will long remain wholly monopolized by\r\nthe American congress. The Irishman has not only the liberty to\r\nemigrate from his country, but he has liberty at home. He can write,\r\nand speak, and cooperate for the attainment of his rights and the\r\nredress of his wrongs.\r\n\r\nThe multitude can assemble upon all the green hills and fertile plains\r\nof the Emerald Isle; they can pour out their grievances, and proclaim\r\ntheir wants without molestation; and the press, that “swift-winged\r\nmessenger,” can bear the tidings of their doings to the extreme bounds\r\nof the civilized world. They have their “Conciliation Hall,” on the\r\nbanks of the Liffey, their reform clubs, and their newspapers; they\r\npass resolutions, send forth addresses, and enjoy the right of\r\npetition. But how is it with the American slave? Where may he assemble?\r\nWhere is his Conciliation Hall? Where are his newspapers? Where is his\r\nright of petition? Where is his freedom of speech? his liberty of the\r\npress? and his right of locomotion? He is said to be happy; happy men\r\ncan speak. But ask the slave what is his condition—what his state of\r\nmind—what he thinks of enslavement? and you had as well address your\r\ninquiries to the _silent dead_. There comes no _voice_ from the\r\nenslaved. We are left to gather his feelings by imagining what ours\r\nwould be, were our souls in his soul’s stead.\r\n\r\nIf there were no other fact descriptive of slavery, than that the slave\r\nis dumb, this alone would be sufficient to mark the slave system as a\r\ngrand aggregation of human horrors.\r\n\r\nMost who are present, will have observed that leading men in this\r\ncountry have been putting forth their skill to secure quiet to the\r\nnation. A system of measures to promote this object was adopted a few\r\nmonths ago in congress. The result of those measures is known. Instead\r\nof quiet, they have produced alarm; instead of peace, they have brought\r\nus war; and so it must ever be.\r\n\r\nWhile this nation is guilty of the enslavement of three millions of\r\ninnocent men and women, it is as idle to think of having a sound and\r\nlasting peace, as it is to think there is no God to take cognizance of\r\nthe affairs of men. There can be no peace to the wicked while slavery\r\ncontinues in the land. It will be condemned; and while it is condemned\r\nthere will be agitation. Nature must cease to be nature; men must\r\nbecome monsters; humanity must be transformed; Christianity must be\r\nexterminated; all ideas of justice and the laws of eternal goodness\r\nmust be utterly blotted out from the human soul—ere a system so foul\r\nand infernal can escape condemnation, or this guilty republic can have\r\na sound, enduring peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINHUMANITY OF SLAVERY. Extract from A Lecture on Slavery, at Rochester,\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 8, 1850\r\n\r\nThe relation of master and slave has been called patriarchal, and only\r\nsecond in benignity and tenderness to that of the parent and child.\r\nThis representation is doubtless believed by many northern people; and\r\nthis may account, in part, for the lack of interest which we find among\r\npersons whom we are bound to believe to be honest and humane. What,\r\nthen, are the facts? Here I will not quote my own experience in\r\nslavery; for this you might call one-sided testimony. I will not cite\r\nthe declarations of abolitionists; for these you might pronounce\r\nexaggerations. I will not rely upon advertisements cut from newspapers;\r\nfor these you might call isolated cases. But I will refer you to the\r\nlaws adopted by the legislatures of the slave states. I give you such\r\nevidence, because it cannot be invalidated nor denied. I hold in my\r\nhand sundry extracts from the slave codes of our country, from which I\r\nwill quote. * * *\r\n\r\nNow, if the foregoing be an indication of kindness, _what is cruelty_?\r\nIf this be parental affection, _what is bitter malignity_? A more\r\natrocious and blood-thirsty string of laws could not well be conceived\r\nof. And yet I am bound to say that they fall short of indicating the\r\nhorrible cruelties constantly practiced in the slave states.\r\n\r\nI admit that there are individual slaveholders less cruel and barbarous\r\nthan is allowed by law; but these form the exception. The majority of\r\nslaveholders find it necessary, to insure obedience, at times, to avail\r\nthemselves of the utmost extent of the law, and many go beyond it. If\r\nkindness were the rule, we should not see advertisements filling the\r\ncolumns of almost every southern newspaper, offering large rewards for\r\nfugitive slaves, and describing them as being branded with irons,\r\nloaded with chains, and scarred by the whip. One of the most telling\r\ntestimonies against the pretended kindness of slaveholders, is the fact\r\nthat uncounted numbers of fugitives are now inhabiting the Dismal\r\nSwamp, preferring the untamed wilderness to their cultivated\r\nhomes—choosing rather to encounter hunger and thirst, and to roam with\r\nthe wild beasts of the forest, running the hazard of being hunted and\r\nshot down, than to submit to the authority of _kind_ masters.\r\n\r\nI tell you, my friends, humanity is never driven to such an unnatural\r\ncourse of life, without great wrong. The slave finds more of the milk\r\nof human kindness in the bosom of the savage Indian, than in the heart\r\nof his _Christian_ master. He leaves the man of the _bible_, and takes\r\nrefuge with the man of the _tomahawk_. He rushes from the praying\r\nslaveholder into the paws of the bear. He quits the homes of men for\r\nthe haunts of wolves. He prefers to encounter a life of trial, however\r\nbitter, or death, however terrible, to dragging out his existence under\r\nthe dominion of these _kind_ masters.\r\n\r\nThe apologists for slavery often speak of the abuses of slavery; and\r\nthey tell us that they are as much opposed to those abuses as we are;\r\nand that they would go as far to correct those abuses and to ameliorate\r\nthe condition of the slave as anybody. The answer to that view is, that\r\nslavery is itself an abuse; that it lives by abuse; and dies by the\r\nabsence of abuse. Grant that slavery is right; grant that the relations\r\nof master and slave may innocently exist; and there is not a single\r\noutrage which was ever committed against the slave but what finds an\r\napology in the very necessity of the case. As we said by a slaveholder\r\n(the Rev. A. G. Few) to the Methodist conference, “If the relation be\r\nright, the means to maintain it are also right;” for without those\r\nmeans slavery could not exist. Remove the dreadful scourge—the plaited\r\nthong—the galling fetter—the accursed chain—and let the slaveholder\r\nrely solely upon moral and religious power, by which to secure\r\nobedience to his orders, and how long do you suppose a slave would\r\nremain on his plantation? The case only needs to be stated; it carries\r\nits own refutation with it.\r\n\r\nAbsolute and arbitrary power can never be maintained by one man over\r\nthe body and soul of another man, without brutal chastisement and\r\nenormous cruelty.\r\n\r\nTo talk of _kindness_ entering into a relation in which one party is\r\nrobbed of wife, of children, of his hard earnings, of home, of friends,\r\nof society, of knowledge, and of all that makes this life desirable, is\r\nmost absurd, wicked, and preposterous.\r\n\r\nI have shown that slavery is wicked—wicked, in that it violates the\r\ngreat law of liberty, written on every human heart—wicked, in that it\r\nviolates the first command of the decalogue—wicked, in that it fosters\r\nthe most disgusting licentiousness—wicked, in that it mars and defaces\r\nthe image of God by cruel and barbarous inflictions—wicked, in that it\r\ncontravenes the laws of eternal justice, and tramples in the dust all\r\nthe humane and heavenly precepts of the New Testament.\r\n\r\nThe evils resulting from this huge system of iniquity are not confined\r\nto the states south of Mason and Dixon’s line. Its noxious influence\r\ncan easily be traced throughout our northern borders. It comes even as\r\nfar north as the state of New York. Traces of it may be seen even in\r\nRochester; and travelers have told me it casts its gloomy shadows\r\nacross the lake, approaching the very shores of Queen Victoria’s\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nThe presence of slavery may be explained by—as it is the explanation\r\nof—the mobocratic violence which lately disgraced New York, and which\r\nstill more recently disgraced the city of Boston. These violent\r\ndemonstrations, these outrageous invasions of human rights, faintly\r\nindicate the presence and power of slavery here. It is a significant\r\nfact, that while meetings for almost any purpose under heaven may be\r\nheld unmolested in the city of Boston, that in the same city, a meeting\r\ncannot be peaceably held for the purpose of preaching the doctrine of\r\nthe American Declaration of Independence, “that all men are created\r\nequal.” The pestiferous breath of slavery taints the whole moral\r\natmosphere of the north, and enervates the moral energies of the whole\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe moment a foreigner ventures upon our soil, and utters a natural\r\nrepugnance to oppression, that moment he is made to feel that there is\r\nlittle sympathy in this land for him. If he were greeted with smiles\r\nbefore, he meets with frowns now; and it shall go well with him if he\r\nbe not subjected to that peculiarly fining method of showing fealty to\r\nslavery, the assaults of a mob.\r\n\r\nNow, will any man tell me that such a state of things is natural, and\r\nthat such conduct on the part of the people of the north, springs from\r\na consciousness of rectitude? No! every fibre of the human heart unites\r\nin detestation of tyranny, and it is only when the human mind has\r\nbecome familiarized with slavery, is accustomed to its injustice, and\r\ncorrupted by its selfishness, that it fails to record its abhorrence of\r\nslavery, and does not exult in the triumphs of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe northern people have been long connected with slavery; they have\r\nbeen linked to a decaying corpse, which has destroyed the moral health.\r\nThe union of the government; the union of the north and south, in the\r\npolitical parties; the union in the religious organizations of the\r\nland, have all served to deaden the moral sense of the northern people,\r\nand to impregnate them with sentiments and ideas forever in conflict\r\nwith what as a nation we call _genius of American institutions_.\r\nRightly viewed, this is an alarming fact, and ought to rally all that\r\nis pure, just, and holy in one determined effort to crush the monster\r\nof corruption, and to scatter “its guilty profits” to the winds. In a\r\nhigh moral sense, as well as in a national sense, the whole American\r\npeople are responsible for slavery, and must share, in its guilt and\r\nshame, with the most obdurate men-stealers of the south.\r\n\r\nWhile slavery exists, and the union of these states endures, every\r\nAmerican citizen must bear the chagrin of hearing his country branded\r\nbefore the world as a nation of liars and hypocrites; and behold his\r\ncherished flag pointed at with the utmost scorn and derision. Even now\r\nan American _abroad_ is pointed out in the crowd, as coming from a land\r\nwhere men gain their fortunes by “the blood of souls,” from a land of\r\nslave markets, of blood-hounds, and slave-hunters; and, in some\r\ncircles, such a man is shunned altogether, as a moral pest. Is it not\r\ntime, then, for every American to awake, and inquire into his duty with\r\nrespect to this subject?\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips—the eloquent New England orator—on his return from\r\nEurope, in 1842, said, “As I stood upon the shores of Genoa, and saw\r\nfloating on the placid waters of the Mediterranean, the beautiful\r\nAmerican war ship Ohio, with her masts tapering proportionately aloft,\r\nand an eastern sun reflecting her noble form upon the sparkling waters,\r\nattracting the gaze of the multitude, my first impulse was of pride, to\r\nthink myself an American; but when I thought that the first time that\r\ngallant ship would gird on her gorgeous apparel, and wake from beneath\r\nher sides her dormant thunders, it would be in defense of the African\r\nslave trade, I blushed in utter _shame_ for my country.”\r\n\r\nLet me say again, _slavery is alike the sin and the shame of the\r\nAmerican people;_ it is a blot upon the American name, and the only\r\nnational reproach which need make an American hang his head in shame,\r\nin the presence of monarchical governments.\r\n\r\nWith this gigantic evil in the land, we are constantly told to look _at\r\nhome;_ if we say ought against crowned heads, we are pointed to our\r\nenslaved millions; if we talk of sending missionaries and bibles\r\nabroad, we are pointed to three millions now lying in worse than\r\nheathen darkness; if we express a word of sympathy for Kossuth and his\r\nHungarian fugitive brethren, we are pointed to that horrible and\r\nhell-black enactment, “the fugitive slave bill.”\r\n\r\nSlavery blunts the edge of all our rebukes of tyranny abroad—the\r\ncriticisms that we make upon other nations, only call forth ridicule,\r\ncontempt, and scorn. In a word, we are made a reproach and a by-word to\r\na mocking earth, and we must continue to be so made, so long as slavery\r\ncontinues to pollute our soil.\r\n\r\nWe have heard much of late of the virtue of patriotism, the love of\r\ncountry, &c., and this sentiment, so natural and so strong, has been\r\nimpiously appealed to, by all the powers of human selfishness, to\r\ncherish the viper which is stinging our national life away. In its\r\nname, we have been called upon to deepen our infamy before the world,\r\nto rivet the fetter more firmly on the limbs of the enslaved, and to\r\nbecome utterly insensible to the voice of human woe that is wafted to\r\nus on every southern gale. We have been called upon, in its name, to\r\ndesecrate our whole land by the footprints of slave-hunters, and even\r\nto engage ourselves in the horrible business of kidnapping.\r\n\r\nI, too, would invoke the spirit of patriotism; not in a narrow and\r\nrestricted sense, but, I trust, with a broad and manly signification;\r\nnot to cover up our national sins, but to inspire us with sincere\r\nrepentance; not to hide our shame from the the(sic) world’s gaze, but\r\nutterly to abolish the cause of that shame; not to explain away our\r\ngross inconsistencies as a nation, but to remove the hateful, jarring,\r\nand incongruous elements from the land; not to sustain an egregious\r\nwrong, but to unite all our energies in the grand effort to remedy that\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nI would invoke the spirit of patriotism, in the name of the law of the\r\nliving God, natural and revealed, and in the full belief that\r\n“righteousness exalteth a nation, while sin is a reproach to any\r\npeople.” “He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that\r\ndespiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from the\r\nholding of bribes, he shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall\r\nbe the munitions of rocks, bread shall be given him, his water shall be\r\nsure.”\r\n\r\nWe have not only heard much lately of patriotism, and of its aid being\r\ninvoked on the side of slavery and injustice, but the very prosperity\r\nof this people has been called in to deafen them to the voice of duty,\r\nand to lead them onward in the pathway of sin. Thus has the blessing of\r\nGod been converted into a curse. In the spirit of genuine patriotism, I\r\nwarn the American people, by all that is just and honorable, to BEWARE!\r\n\r\nI warn them that, strong, proud, and prosperous though we be, there is\r\na power above us that can “bring down high looks; at the breath of\r\nwhose mouth our wealth may take wings; and before whom every knee shall\r\nbow;” and who can tell how soon the avenging angel may pass over our\r\nland, and the sable bondmen now in chains, may become the instruments\r\nof our nation’s chastisement! Without appealing to any higher feeling,\r\nI would warn the American people, and the American government, to be\r\nwise in their day and generation. I exhort them to remember the history\r\nof other nations; and I remind them that America cannot always sit “as\r\na queen,” in peace and repose; that prouder and stronger governments\r\nthan this have been shattered by the bolts of a just God; that the time\r\nmay come when those they now despise and hate, may be needed; when\r\nthose whom they now compel by oppression to be enemies, may be wanted\r\nas friends. What has been, may be again. There is a point beyond which\r\nhuman endurance cannot go. The crushed worm may yet turn under the heel\r\nof the oppressor. I warn them, then, with all solemnity, and in the\r\nname of retributive justice, _to look to their ways;_ for in an evil\r\nhour, those sable arms that have, for the last two centuries, been\r\nengaged in cultivating and adorning the fair fields of our country, may\r\nyet become the instruments of terror, desolation, and death, throughout\r\nour borders.\r\n\r\nIt was the sage of the Old Dominion that said—while speaking of the\r\npossibility of a conflict between the slaves and the slaveholders—“God\r\nhas no attribute that could take sides with the oppressor in such a\r\ncontest. I tremble for my country when I reflect that God _is just_,\r\nand that his justice cannot sleep forever.” Such is the warning voice\r\nof Thomas Jefferson; and every day’s experience since its utterance\r\nuntil now, confirms its wisdom, and commends its truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT TO THE SLAVE IS THE FOURTH OF JULY?. Extract from an Oration, at\r\n\r\n\r\nRochester, July 5, 1852\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens—Pardon me, and allow me to ask, why am I called upon to\r\nspeak here to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your\r\nnational independence? Are the great principles of political freedom\r\nand of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence,\r\nextended to us? and am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble\r\noffering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits, and\r\nexpress devout gratitude for the blessings, resulting from your\r\nindependence to us?\r\n\r\nWould to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer\r\ncould be truthfully returned to these questions! Then would my task be\r\nlight, and my burden easy and delightful. For who is there so cold that\r\na nation’s sympathy could not warm him? Who so obdurate and dead to the\r\nclaims of gratitude, that would not thankfully acknowledge such\r\npriceless benefits? Who so stolid and selfish, that would not give his\r\nvoice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation’s jubilee, when the chains\r\nof servitude had been torn from his limbs? I am not that man. In a case\r\nlike that, the dumb might eloquently speak, and the “lame man leap as\r\nan hart.”\r\n\r\nBut, such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of\r\nthe disparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this\r\nglorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the\r\nimmeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you this day\r\nrejoice, are not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice,\r\nliberty, prosperity, and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is\r\nshared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to\r\nyou, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth of July is\r\n_yours_, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in\r\nfetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him\r\nto join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious\r\nirony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak to-day?\r\nIf so, there is a parallel to your conduct. And let me warn you that it\r\nis dangerous to copy the example of a nation whose crimes, towering up\r\nto heaven, were thrown down by the breath of the Almighty, burying that\r\nnation in irrecoverable ruin! I can to-day take up the plaintive lament\r\nof a peeled and woe-smitten people.\r\n\r\n“By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yea! we wept when we\r\nremembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst\r\nthereof. For there, they that carried us away captive, required of us a\r\nsong; and they who wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one\r\nof the songs of Zion. How can we sing the Lord’s song in a strange\r\nland? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her\r\ncunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of\r\nmy mouth.”\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, above your national, tumultous joy, I hear the\r\nmournful wail of millions, whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday,\r\nare to-day rendered more intolerable by the jubilant shouts that reach\r\nthem. If I do forget, if I do not faithfully remember those bleeding\r\nchildren of sorrow this day, “may my right hand forget her cunning, and\r\nmay my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!” To forget them, to pass\r\nlightly over their wrongs, and to chime in with the popular theme,\r\nwould be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a\r\nreproach before God and the world. My subject, then, fellow-citizens,\r\nis AMERICAN SLAVERY. I shall see this day and its popular\r\ncharacteristics from the slave’s point of view. Standing there,\r\nidentified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not\r\nhesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct\r\nof this nation never looked blacker to me than on this Fourth of July.\r\nWhether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions\r\nof the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and\r\nrevolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and\r\nsolemnly binds herself to be false to the future. Standing with God and\r\nthe crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the name of\r\nhumanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered,\r\nin the name of the constitution and the bible, which are disregarded\r\nand trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all\r\nthe emphasis I can command, everything that serves to perpetuate\r\nslavery—the great sin and shame of America! “I will not equivocate; I\r\nwill not excuse;” I will use the severest language I can command; and\r\nyet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgment is not\r\nblinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not\r\nconfess to be right and just.\r\n\r\nBut I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this\r\ncircumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a\r\nfavorable impression on the public mind. Would you argue more, and\r\ndenounce less, would you persuade more and rebuke less, your cause\r\nwould be much more likely to succeed. But, I submit, where all is plain\r\nthere is nothing to be argued. What point in the anti-slavery creed\r\nwould you have me argue? On what branch of the subject do the people of\r\nthis country need light? Must I undertake to prove that the slave is a\r\nman? That point is conceded already. Nobody doubts it. The slaveholders\r\nthemselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their\r\ngovernment. They acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the\r\npart of the slave. There are seventy-two crimes in the state of\r\nVirginia, which, if committed by a black man (no matter how ignorant he\r\nbe), subject him to the punishment of death; while only two of these\r\nsame crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment. What is\r\nthis but the acknowledgement that the slave is a moral, intellectual,\r\nand responsible being. The manhood of the slave is conceded. It is\r\nadmitted in the fact that southern statute books are covered with\r\nenactments forbidding, under severe fines and penalties, the teaching\r\nof the slave to read or write. When you can point to any such laws, in\r\nreference to the beasts of the field, then I may consent to argue the\r\nmanhood of the slave. When the dogs in your streets, when the fowls of\r\nthe air, when the cattle on your hills, when the fish of the sea, and\r\nthe reptiles that crawl, shall be unable to distinguish the slave from\r\na brute, then will I argue with you that the slave is a man!\r\n\r\nFor the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the Negro\r\nrace. Is it not astonishing that, while we are plowing, planting, and\r\nreaping, using all kinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses,\r\nconstructing bridges, building ships, working in metals of brass, iron,\r\ncopper, silver, and gold; that, while we are reading, writing, and\r\ncyphering, acting as clerks, merchants, and secretaries, having among\r\nus lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors, editors, orators, and\r\nteachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises\r\ncommon to other men—digging gold in California, capturing the whale in\r\nthe Pacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hillside, living, moving,\r\nacting, thinking, planning, living in families as husbands, wives, and\r\nchildren, and, above all, confessing and worshiping the Christian’s\r\nGod, and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave—we\r\nare called upon to prove that we are men!\r\n\r\nWould you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? that he is the\r\nrightful owner of his own body? You have already declared it. Must I\r\nargue the wrongfulness of slavery? Is that a question for republicans?\r\nIs it to be settled by the rules of logic and argumentation, as a\r\nmatter beset with great difficulty, involving a doubtful application of\r\nthe principle of justice, hard to be understood? How should I look\r\nto-day in the presence of Americans, dividing and subdividing a\r\ndiscourse, to show that men have a natural right to freedom, speaking\r\nof it relatively and positively, negatively and affirmatively? To do\r\nso, would be to make myself ridiculous, and to offer an insult to your\r\nunderstanding. There is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven that\r\ndoes not know that slavery is wrong for _him_.\r\n\r\nWhat! am I to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes, to rob them of\r\ntheir liberty, to work them without wages, to keep them ignorant of\r\ntheir relations to their fellow-men, to beat them with sticks, to flay\r\ntheir flesh with the lash, to load their limbs with irons, to hunt them\r\nwith dogs, to sell them at auction, to sunder their families, to knock\r\nout their teeth, to burn their flesh, to starve them into obedience and\r\nsubmission to their masters? Must I argue that a system, thus marked\r\nwith blood and stained with pollution, is wrong? No; I will not. I have\r\nbetter employment for my time and strength than such arguments would\r\nimply.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, remains to be argued? Is it that slavery is not divine;\r\nthat God did not establish it; that our doctors of divinity are\r\nmistaken? There is blasphemy in the thought. That which is inhuman\r\ncannot be divine. Who can reason on such a proposition! They that can,\r\nmay! I cannot. The time for such argument is past.\r\n\r\nAt a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is\r\nneeded. Oh! had I the ability, and could I reach the nation’s ear, I\r\nwould to-day pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting\r\nreproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. For it is not light that\r\nis needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need\r\nthe storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation\r\nmust be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the\r\npropriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation\r\nmust be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed\r\nand denounced.\r\n\r\nWhat to the American slave is your Fourth of July? I answer, a day that\r\nreveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross\r\ninjustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your\r\ncelebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your\r\nnational greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty\r\nand heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass-fronted impudence;\r\nyour shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and\r\nhymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade\r\nand solemnity, are to him mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and\r\nhypocrisy—a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation\r\nof savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more\r\nshocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at\r\nthis very hour.\r\n\r\nGo where you may, search where you will, roam through all the\r\nmonarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through South\r\nAmerica, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay\r\nyour facts by the side of the every-day practices of this nation, and\r\nyou will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless\r\nhypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNAL SLAVE TRADE. Extract from an Oration, at Rochester, July\r\n\r\n\r\n5, 1852\r\n\r\nTake the American slave trade, which, we are told by the papers, is\r\nespecially prosperous just now. Ex-senator Benton tells us that the\r\nprice of men was never higher than now. He mentions the fact to show\r\nthat slavery is in no danger. This trade is one of the peculiarities of\r\nAmerican institutions. It is carried on in all the large towns and\r\ncities in one-half of this confederacy; and millions are pocketed every\r\nyear by dealers in this horrid traffic. In several states this trade is\r\na chief source of wealth. It is called (in contradistinction to the\r\nforeign slave trade) _“the internal slave trade_.” It is, probably,\r\ncalled so, too, in order to divert from it the horror with which the\r\nforeign slave trade is contemplated. That trade has long since been\r\ndenounced by this government as piracy. It has been denounced with\r\nburning words, from the high places of the nation, as an execrable\r\ntraffic. To arrest it, to put an end to it, this nation keeps a\r\nsquadron, at immense cost, on the coast of Africa. Everywhere in this\r\ncountry, it is safe to speak of this foreign slave trade as a most\r\ninhuman traffic, opposed alike to the laws of God and of man. The duty\r\nto extirpate and destroy it is admitted even by our _doctors of\r\ndivinity_. In order to put an end to it, some of these last have\r\nconsented that their colored brethren (nominally free) should leave\r\nthis country, and establish themselves on the western coast of Africa.\r\nIt is, however, a notable fact, that, while so much execration is\r\npoured out by Americans, upon those engaged in the foreign slave trade,\r\nthe men engaged in the slave trade between the states pass without\r\ncondemnation, and their business is deemed honorable.\r\n\r\nBehold the practical operation of this internal slave trade—the\r\nAmerican slave trade sustained by American politics and American\r\nreligion! Here you will see men and women reared like swine for the\r\nmarket. You know what is a swine-drover? I will show you a man-drover.\r\nThey inhabit all our southern states. They perambulate the country, and\r\ncrowd the highways of the nation with droves of human stock. You will\r\nsee one of these human-flesh-jobbers, armed with pistol, whip, and\r\nbowie-knife, driving a company of a hundred men, women, and children,\r\nfrom the Potomac to the slave market at New Orleans. These wretched\r\npeople are to be sold singly, or in lots, to suit purchasers. They are\r\nfood for the cotton-field and the deadly sugar-mill. Mark the sad\r\nprocession as it moves wearily along, and the inhuman wretch who drives\r\nthem. Hear his savage yells and his blood-chilling oaths, as he hurries\r\non his affrighted captives. There, see the old man, with locks thinned\r\nand gray. Cast one glance, if you please, upon that young mother, whose\r\nshoulders are bare to the scorching sun, her briny tears falling on the\r\nbrow of the babe in her arms. See, too, that girl of thirteen, weeping,\r\nyes, weeping, as she thinks of the mother from whom she has been torn.\r\nThe drove moves tardily. Heat and sorrow have nearly consumed their\r\nstrength. Suddenly you hear a quick snap, like the discharge of a\r\nrifle; the fetters clank, and the chain rattles simultaneously; your\r\nears are saluted with a scream that seems to have torn its way to the\r\ncenter of your soul. The crack you heard was the sound of the slave\r\nwhip; the scream you heard was from the woman you saw with the babe.\r\nHer speed had faltered under the weight of her child and her chains;\r\nthat gash on her shoulder tells her to move on. Follow this drove to\r\nNew Orleans. Attend the auction; see men examined like horses; see the\r\nforms of women rudely and brutally exposed to the shocking gaze of\r\nAmerican slave-buyers. See this drove sold and separated forever; and\r\nnever forget the deep, sad sobs that arose from that scattered\r\nmultitude. Tell me, citizens, where, under the sun, can you witness a\r\nspectacle more fiendish and shocking. Yet this is but a glance at the\r\nAmerican slave trade, as it exists at this moment, in the ruling part\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nI was born amid such sights and scenes. To me the American slave trade\r\nis a terrible reality. When a child, my soul was often pierced with a\r\nsense of its horrors. I lived on Philpot street, Fell’s Point,\r\nBaltimore, and have watched from the wharves the slave ships in the\r\nbasin, anchored from the shore, with their cargoes of human flesh,\r\nwaiting for favorable winds to waft them down the Chesapeake. There\r\nwas, at that time, a grand slave mart kept at the head of Pratt street,\r\nby Austin Woldfolk. His agents were sent into every town and county in\r\nMaryland, announcing their arrival through the papers, and on flaming\r\nhand-bills, headed, “cash for negroes.” These men were generally well\r\ndressed, and very captivating in their manners; ever ready to drink, to\r\ntreat, and to gamble. The fate of many a slave has depended upon the\r\nturn of a single card; and many a child has been snatched from the arms\r\nof its mothers by bargains arranged in a state of brutal drunkenness.\r\n\r\nThe flesh-mongers gather up their victims by dozens, and drive them,\r\nchained, to the general depot at Baltimore. When a sufficient number\r\nhave been collected here, a ship is chartered, for the purpose of\r\nconveying the forlorn crew to Mobile or to New Orleans. From the\r\nslave-prison to the ship, they are usually driven in the darkness of\r\nnight; for since the anti-slavery agitation a certain caution is\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIn the deep, still darkness of midnight, I have been often aroused by\r\nthe dead, heavy footsteps and the piteous cries of the chained gangs\r\nthat passed our door. The anguish of my boyish heart was intense; and I\r\nwas often consoled, when speaking to my mistress in the morning, to\r\nhear her say that the custom was very wicked; that she hated to hear\r\nthe rattle of the chains, and the heart-rending cries. I was glad to\r\nfind one who sympathized with me in my horror.\r\n\r\nFellow citizens, this murderous traffic is to-day in active operation\r\nin this boasted republic. In the solitude of my spirit, I see clouds of\r\ndust raised on the highways of the south; I see the bleeding footsteps;\r\nI hear the doleful wail of fettered humanity, on the way to the slave\r\nmarkets, where the victims are to be sold like horses, sheep, and\r\nswine, knocked off to the highest bidder. There I see the tenderest\r\nties ruthlessly broken, to gratify the lust, caprice, and rapacity of\r\nthe buyers and sellers of men. My soul sickens at the sight.\r\n\r\nIs this the land your fathers loved?\r\n    The freedom which they toiled to win?\r\nIs this the earth whereon they moved?\r\n    Are these the graves they slumber in?\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a still more inhuman, disgraceful, and scandalous state of things\r\nremains to be presented. By an act of the American congress, not yet\r\ntwo years old, slavery has been nationalized in its most horrible and\r\nrevolting form. By that act, Mason and Dixon’s line has been\r\nobliterated; New York has become as Virginia; and the power to hold,\r\nhunt, and sell men, women, and children as slaves, remains no longer a\r\nmere state institution, but is now an institution of the whole United\r\nStates. The power is coextensive with the star-spangled banner and\r\nAmerican christianity. Where these go, may also go the merciless\r\nslave-hunter. Where these are, man is not sacred. He is a bird for the\r\nsportsman’s gun. By that most foul and fiendish of all human decrees,\r\nthe liberty and person of every man are put in peril. Your broad\r\nrepublican domain is a hunting-ground for _men_. Not for thieves and\r\nrobbers, enemies of society, merely, but for men guilty of no crime.\r\nYour law-makers have commanded all good citizens to engage in this\r\nhellish sport. Your president, your secretary of state, your lords,\r\nnobles, and ecclesiastics, enforce as a duty you owe to your free and\r\nglorious country and to your God, that you do this accursed thing. Not\r\nfewer than forty Americans have within the past two years been hunted\r\ndown, and without a moment’s warning, hurried away in chains, and\r\nconsigned to slavery and excruciating torture. Some of these have had\r\nwives and children dependent on them for bread; but of this no account\r\nwas made. The right of the hunter to his prey, stands superior to the\r\nright of marriage, and to _all_ rights in this republic, the rights of\r\nGod included! For black men there are neither law, justice, humanity,\r\nnor religion. The fugitive slave law makes MERCY TO THEM A CRIME; and\r\nbribes the judge who tries them. An American judge GETS TEN DOLLARS FOR\r\nEVERY VICTIM HE CONSIGNS to slavery, and five, when he fails to do so.\r\nThe oath of an(sic) two villains is sufficient, under this hell-black\r\nenactment, to send the most pious and exemplary black man into the\r\nremorseless jaws of slavery! His own testimony is nothing. He can bring\r\nno witnesses for himself. The minister of American justice is bound by\r\nthe law to hear but _one side_, and that side is the side of the\r\noppressor. Let this damning fact be perpetually told. Let it be\r\nthundered around the world, that, in tyrant-killing, king hating,\r\npeople-loving, democratic, Christian America, the seats of justice are\r\nfilled with judges, who hold their office under an open and palpable\r\n_bribe_, and are bound, in deciding in the case of a man’s liberty, _to\r\nhear only his accusers!_\r\n\r\nIn glaring violation of justice, in shameless disregard of the forms of\r\nadministering law, in cunning arrangement to entrap the defenseless,\r\nand in diabolical intent, this fugitive slave law stands alone in the\r\nannals of tyrannical legislation. I doubt if there be another nation on\r\nthe globe having the brass and the baseness to put such a law on the\r\nstatute-book. If any man in this assembly thinks differently from me in\r\nthis matter, and feels able to disprove my statements, I will gladly\r\nconfront him at any suitable time and place he may select.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVERY PARTY. Extract from a Speech Delivered before the A. A. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nSociety, in New York, May, 1853.\r\n\r\nSir, it is evident that there is in this country a purely slavery\r\nparty—a party which exists for no other earthly purpose but to promote\r\nthe interests of slavery. The presence of this party is felt everywhere\r\nin the republic. It is known by no particular name, and has assumed no\r\ndefinite shape; but its branches reach far and wide in the church and\r\nin the state. This shapeless and nameless party is not intangible in\r\nother and more important respects. That party, sir, has determined upon\r\na fixed, definite, and comprehensive policy toward the whole colored\r\npopulation of the United States. What that policy is, it becomes us as\r\nabolitionists, and especially does it become the colored people\r\nthemselves, to consider and to understand fully. We ought to know who\r\nour enemies are, where they are, and what are their objects and\r\nmeasures. Well, sir, here is my version of it—not original with me—but\r\nmine because I hold it to be true.\r\n\r\nI understand this policy to comprehend five cardinal objects. They are\r\nthese: 1st. The complete suppression of all anti-slavery discussion.\r\n2d. The expatriation of the entire free people of color from the United\r\nStates. 3d. The unending perpetuation of slavery in this republic. 4th.\r\nThe nationalization of slavery to the extent of making slavery\r\nrespected in every state of the Union. 5th. The extension of slavery\r\nover Mexico and the entire South American states.\r\n\r\nSir, these objects are forcibly presented to us in the stern logic of\r\npassing events; in the facts which are and have been passing around us\r\nduring the last three years. The country has been and is now dividing\r\non these grand issues. In their magnitude, these issues cast all others\r\ninto the shade, depriving them of all life and vitality. Old party ties\r\nare broken. Like is finding its like on either side of these great\r\nissues, and the great battle is at hand. For the present, the best\r\nrepresentative of the slavery party in politics is the democratic\r\nparty. Its great head for the present is President Pierce, whose boast\r\nit was, before his election, that his whole life had been consistent\r\nwith the interests of slavery, that he is above reproach on that score.\r\nIn his inaugural address, he reassures the south on this point. Well,\r\nthe head of the slave power being in power, it is natural that the pro\r\nslavery elements should cluster around the administration, and this is\r\nrapidly being done. A fraternization is going on. The stringent\r\nprotectionists and the free-traders strike hands. The supporters of\r\nFillmore are becoming the supporters of Pierce. The silver-gray whig\r\nshakes hands with the hunker democrat; the former only differing from\r\nthe latter in name. They are of one heart, one mind, and the union is\r\nnatural and perhaps inevitable. Both hate Negroes; both hate progress;\r\nboth hate the “higher law;” both hate William H. Seward; both hate the\r\nfree democratic party; and upon this hateful basis they are forming a\r\nunion of hatred. “Pilate and Herod are thus made friends.” Even the\r\ncentral organ of the whig party is extending its beggar hand for a\r\nmorsel from the table of slavery democracy, and when spurned from the\r\nfeast by the more deserving, it pockets the insult; when kicked on one\r\nside it turns the other, and preseveres in its importunities. The fact\r\nis, that paper comprehends the demands of the times; it understands the\r\nage and its issues; it wisely sees that slavery and freedom are the\r\ngreat antagonistic forces in the country, and it goes to its own side.\r\nSilver grays and hunkers all understand this. They are, therefore,\r\nrapidly sinking all other questions to nothing, compared with the\r\nincreasing demands of slavery. They are collecting, arranging, and\r\nconsolidating their forces for the accomplishment of their appointed\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe keystone to the arch of this grand union of the slavery party of\r\nthe United States, is the compromise of 1850. In that compromise we\r\nhave all the objects of our slaveholding policy specified. It is, sir,\r\nfavorable to this view of the designs of the slave power, that both the\r\nwhig and the democratic party bent lower, sunk deeper, and strained\r\nharder, in their conventions, preparatory to the late presidential\r\nelection, to meet the demands of the slavery party than at any previous\r\ntime in their history. Never did parties come before the northern\r\npeople with propositions of such undisguised contempt for the moral\r\nsentiment and the religious ideas of that people. They virtually asked\r\nthem to unite in a war upon free speech, and upon conscience, and to\r\ndrive the Almighty presence from the councils of the nation. Resting\r\ntheir platforms upon the fugitive slave bill, they boldly asked the\r\npeople for political power to execute the horrible and hell-black\r\nprovisions of that bill. The history of that election reveals, with\r\ngreat clearness, the extent to which slavery has shot its leprous\r\ndistillment through the life-blood of the nation. The party most\r\nthoroughly opposed to the cause of justice and humanity, triumphed;\r\nwhile the party suspected of a leaning toward liberty, was\r\noverwhelmingly defeated, some say annihilated.\r\n\r\nBut here is a still more important fact, illustrating the designs of\r\nthe slave power. It is a fact full of meaning, that no sooner did the\r\ndemocratic slavery party come into power, than a system of legislation\r\nwas presented to the legislatures of the northern states, designed to\r\nput the states in harmony with the fugitive slave law, and the\r\nmalignant bearing of the national government toward the colored\r\ninhabitants of the country. This whole movement on the part of the\r\nstates, bears the evidence of having one origin, emanating from one\r\nhead, and urged forward by one power. It was simultaneous, uniform, and\r\ngeneral, and looked to one end. It was intended to put thorns under\r\nfeet already bleeding; to crush a people already bowed down; to enslave\r\na people already but half free; in a word, it was intended to\r\ndiscourage, dishearten, and drive the free colored people out of the\r\ncountry. In looking at the recent black law of Illinois, one is struck\r\ndumb with its enormity. It would seem that the men who enacted that\r\nlaw, had not only banished from their minds all sense of justice, but\r\nall sense of shame. It coolly proposes to sell the bodies and souls of\r\nthe blacks to increase the intelligence and refinement of the whites;\r\nto rob every black stranger who ventures among them, to increase their\r\nliterary fund.\r\n\r\nWhile this is going on in the states, a pro-slavery, political board of\r\nhealth is established at Washington. Senators Hale, Chase, and Sumner\r\nare robbed of a part of their senatorial dignity and consequence as\r\nrepresenting sovereign states, because they have refused to be\r\ninoculated with the slavery virus. Among the services which a senator\r\nis expected by his state to perform, are many that can only be done\r\nefficiently on committees; and, in saying to these honorable senators,\r\nyou shall not serve on the committees of this body, the slavery party\r\ntook the responsibility of robbing and insulting the states that sent\r\nthem. It is an attempt at Washington to decide for the states who shall\r\nbe sent to the senate. Sir, it strikes me that this aggression on the\r\npart of the slave power did not meet at the hands of the proscribed\r\nsenators the rebuke which we had a right to expect would be\r\nadministered. It seems to me that an opportunity was lost, that the\r\ngreat principle of senatorial equality was left undefended, at a time\r\nwhen its vindication was sternly demanded. But it is not to the purpose\r\nof my present statement to criticise the conduct of our friends. I am\r\npersuaded that much ought to be left to the discretion of anti slavery\r\nmen in congress, and charges of recreancy should never be made but on\r\nthe most sufficient grounds. For, of all the places in the world where\r\nan anti-slavery man needs the confidence and encouragement of friends,\r\nI take Washington to be that place.\r\n\r\nLet me now call attention to the social influences which are operating\r\nand cooperating with the slavery party of the country, designed to\r\ncontribute to one or all of the grand objects aimed at by that party.\r\nWe see here the black man attacked in his vital interests; prejudice\r\nand hate are excited against him; enmity is stirred up between him and\r\nother laborers. The Irish people, warm-hearted, generous, and\r\nsympathizing with the oppressed everywhere, when they stand upon their\r\nown green island, are instantly taught, on arriving in this Christian\r\ncountry, to hate and despise the colored people. They are taught to\r\nbelieve that we eat the bread which of right belongs to them. The cruel\r\nlie is told the Irish, that our adversity is essential to their\r\nprosperity. Sir, the Irish-American will find out his mistake one day.\r\nHe will find that in assuming our avocation he also has assumed our\r\ndegradation. But for the present we are sufferers. The old employments\r\nby which we have heretofore gained our livelihood, are gradually, and\r\nit may be inevitably, passing into other hands. Every hour sees us\r\nelbowed out of some employment to make room perhaps for some\r\nnewly-arrived emigrants, whose hunger and color are thought to give\r\nthem a title to especial favor. White men are becoming house-servants,\r\ncooks, and stewards, common laborers, and flunkeys to our gentry, and,\r\nfor aught I see, they adjust themselves to their stations with all\r\nbecoming obsequiousness. This fact proves that if we cannot rise to the\r\nwhites, the whites can fall to us. Now, sir, look once more. While the\r\ncolored people are thus elbowed out of employment; while the enmity of\r\nemigrants is being excited against us; while state after state enacts\r\nlaws against us; while we are hunted down, like wild game, and\r\noppressed with a general feeling of insecurity—the American\r\ncolonization society—that old offender against the best interests and\r\nslanderer of the colored people—awakens to new life, and vigorously\r\npresses its scheme upon the consideration of the people and the\r\ngovernment. New papers are started—some for the north and some for the\r\nsouth—and each in its tone adapting itself to its latitude. Government,\r\nstate and national, is called upon for appropriations to enable the\r\nsociety to send us out of the country by steam! They want steamers to\r\ncarry letters and Negroes to Africa. Evidently, this society looks upon\r\nour “extremity as its opportunity,” and we may expect that it will use\r\nthe occasion well. They do not deplore, but glory, in our misfortunes.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, I must hasten. I have thus briefly given my view of one\r\naspect of the present condition and future prospects of the colored\r\npeople of the United States. And what I have said is far from\r\nencouraging to my afflicted people. I have seen the cloud gather upon\r\nthe sable brows of some who hear me. I confess the case looks black\r\nenough. Sir, I am not a hopeful man. I think I am apt even to\r\nundercalculate the benefits of the future. Yet, sir, in this seemingly\r\ndesperate case, I do not despair for my people. There is a bright side\r\nto almost every picture of this kind; and ours is no exception to the\r\ngeneral rule. If the influences against us are strong, those for us are\r\nalso strong. To the inquiry, will our enemies prevail in the execution\r\nof their designs. In my God and in my soul, I believe they _will not_.\r\nLet us look at the first object sought for by the slavery party of the\r\ncountry, viz: the suppression of anti slavery discussion. They desire\r\nto suppress discussion on this subject, with a view to the peace of the\r\nslaveholder and the security of slavery. Now, sir, neither the\r\nprinciple nor the subordinate objects here declared, can be at all\r\ngained by the slave power, and for this reason: It involves the\r\nproposition to padlock the lips of the whites, in order to secure the\r\nfetters on the limbs of the blacks. The right of speech, precious and\r\npriceless, _cannot, will not_, be surrendered to slavery. Its\r\nsuppression is asked for, as I have said, to give peace and security to\r\nslaveholders. Sir, that thing cannot be done. God has interposed an\r\ninsuperable obstacle to any such result. “There can be _no peace_,\r\nsaith my God, to the wicked.” Suppose it were possible to put down this\r\ndiscussion, what would it avail the guilty slaveholder, pillowed as he\r\nis upon heaving bosoms of ruined souls? He could not have a peaceful\r\nspirit. If every anti-slavery tongue in the nation were silent—every\r\nanti-slavery organization dissolved—every anti-slavery press\r\ndemolished—every anti slavery periodical, paper, book, pamphlet, or\r\nwhat not, were searched out, gathered, deliberately burned to ashes,\r\nand their ashes given to the four winds of heaven, still, still the\r\nslaveholder could have _“no peace_.” In every pulsation of his heart,\r\nin every throb of his life, in every glance of his eye, in the breeze\r\nthat soothes, and in the thunder that startles, would be waked up an\r\naccuser, whose cause is, “Thou art, verily, guilty concerning thy\r\nbrother.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENT. Extracts from a Lecture before Various\r\n\r\n\r\nAnti-Slavery Bodies, in the Winter of 1855.\r\n\r\nA grand movement on the part of mankind, in any direction, or for any\r\npurpose, moral or political, is an interesting fact, fit and proper to\r\nbe studied. It is such, not only for those who eagerly participate in\r\nit, but also for those who stand aloof from it—even for those by whom\r\nit is opposed. I take the anti-slavery movement to be such an one, and\r\na movement as sublime and glorious in its character, as it is holy and\r\nbeneficent in the ends it aims to accomplish. At this moment, I deem it\r\nsafe to say, it is properly engrossing more minds in this country than\r\nany other subject now before the American people. The late John C.\r\nCalhoun—one of the mightiest men that ever stood up in the American\r\nsenate—did not deem it beneath him; and he probably studied it as\r\ndeeply, though not as honestly, as Gerrit Smith, or William Lloyd\r\nGarrison. He evinced the greatest familiarity with the subject; and the\r\ngreatest efforts of his last years in the senate had direct reference\r\nto this movement. His eagle eye watched every new development connected\r\nwith it; and he was ever prompt to inform the south of every important\r\nstep in its progress. He never allowed himself to make light of it; but\r\nalways spoke of it and treated it as a matter of grave import; and in\r\nthis he showed himself a master of the mental, moral, and religious\r\nconstitution of human society. Daniel Webster, too, in the better days\r\nof his life, before he gave his assent to the fugitive slave bill, and\r\ntrampled upon all his earlier and better convictions—when his eye was\r\nyet single—he clearly comprehended the nature of the elements involved\r\nin this movement; and in his own majestic eloquence, warned the south,\r\nand the country, to have a care how they attempted to put it down. He\r\nis an illustration that it is easier to give, than to take, good\r\nadvice. To these two men—the greatest men to whom the nation has yet\r\ngiven birth—may be traced the two great facts of the present—the south\r\ntriumphant, and the north humbled. Their names may stand thus—Calhoun\r\nand domination—Webster and degradation. Yet again. If to the enemies of\r\nliberty this subject is one of engrossing interest, vastly more so\r\nshould it be such to freedom’s friends. The latter, it leads to the\r\ngates of all valuable knowledge—philanthropic, ethical, and religious;\r\nfor it brings them to the study of man, wonderfully and fearfully\r\nmade—the proper study of man through all time—the open book, in which\r\nare the records of time and eternity.\r\n\r\nOf the existence and power of the anti-slavery movement, as a fact, you\r\nneed no evidence. The nation has seen its face, and felt the\r\ncontrolling pressure of its hand. You have seen it moving in all\r\ndirections, and in all weathers, and in all places, appearing most\r\nwhere desired least, and pressing hardest where most resisted. No place\r\nis exempt. The quiet prayer meeting, and the stormy halls of national\r\ndebate, share its presence alike. It is a common intruder, and of\r\ncourse has the name of being ungentlemanly. Brethren who had long sung,\r\nin the most affectionate fervor, and with the greatest sense of\r\nsecurity,\r\n\r\nTogether let us sweetly live—together let us die,\r\n\r\n\r\nhave been suddenly and violently separated by it, and ranged in hostile\r\nattitude toward each other. The Methodist, one of the most powerful\r\nreligious organizations of this country, has been rent asunder, and its\r\nstrongest bolts of denominational brotherhood started at a single\r\nsurge. It has changed the tone of the northern pulpit, and modified\r\nthat of the press. A celebrated divine, who, four years ago, was for\r\nflinging his own mother, or brother, into the remorseless jaws of the\r\nmonster slavery, lest he should swallow up the Union, now recognizes\r\nanti-slavery as a characteristic of future civilization. Signs and\r\nwonders follow this movement; and the fact just stated is one of them.\r\nParty ties are loosened by it; and men are compelled to take sides for\r\nor against it, whether they will or not. Come from where he may, or\r\ncome for what he may, he is compelled to show his hand. What is this\r\nmighty force? What is its history? and what is its destiny? Is it\r\nancient or modern, transient or permanent? Has it turned aside, like a\r\nstranger and a sojourner, to tarry for a night? or has it come to rest\r\nwith us forever? Excellent chances are here for speculation; and some\r\nof them are quite profound. We might, for instance, proceed to inquire\r\nnot only into the philosophy of the anti-slavery movement, but into the\r\nphilosophy of the law, in obedience to which that movement started into\r\nexistence. We might demand to know what is that law or power, which, at\r\ndifferent times, disposes the minds of men to this or that particular\r\nobject—now for peace, and now for war—now for freedom, and now for\r\nslavery; but this profound question I leave to the abolitionists of the\r\nsuperior class to answer. The speculations which must precede such\r\nanswer, would afford, perhaps, about the same satisfaction as the\r\nlearned theories which have rained down upon the world, from time to\r\ntime, as to the origin of evil. I shall, therefore, avoid water in\r\nwhich I cannot swim, and deal with anti-slavery as a fact, like any\r\nother fact in the history of mankind, capable of being described and\r\nunderstood, both as to its internal forces, and its external phases and\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n[After an eloquent, a full, and highly interesting exposition of the\r\nnature, character, and history of the anti-slavery movement, from the\r\ninsertion of which want of space precludes us, he concluded in the\r\nfollowing happy manner.]\r\n\r\nPresent organizations may perish, but the cause will go on. That cause\r\nhas a life, distinct and independent of the organizations patched up\r\nfrom time to time to carry it forward. Looked at, apart from the bones\r\nand sinews and body, it is a thing immortal. It is the very essence of\r\njustice, liberty, and love. The moral life of human society, it cannot\r\ndie while conscience, honor, and humanity remain. If but one be filled\r\nwith it, the cause lives. Its incarnation in any one individual man,\r\nleaves the whole world a priesthood, occupying the highest moral\r\neminence even that of disinterested benevolence. Whoso has ascended his\r\nheight, and has the grace to stand there, has the world at his feet,\r\nand is the world’s teacher, as of divine right. He may set in judgment\r\non the age, upon the civilization of the age, and upon the religion of\r\nthe age; for he has a test, a sure and certain test, by which to try\r\nall institutions, and to measure all men. I say, he may do this, but\r\nthis is not the chief business for which he is qualified. The great\r\nwork to which he is called is not that of judgment. Like the Prince of\r\nPeace, he may say, if I judge, I judge righteous judgment; still\r\nmainly, like him, he may say, this is not his work. The man who has\r\nthoroughly embraced the principles of justice, love, and liberty, like\r\nthe true preacher of Christianity, is less anxious to reproach the\r\nworld of its sins, than to win it to repentance. His great work on\r\nearth is to exemplify, and to illustrate, and to ingraft those\r\nprinciples upon the living and practical understandings of all men\r\nwithin the reach of his influence. This is his work; long or short his\r\nyears, many or few his adherents, powerful or weak his\r\ninstrumentalities, through good report, or through bad report, this is\r\nhis work. It is to snatch from the bosom of nature the latent facts of\r\neach individual man’s experience, and with steady hand to hold them up\r\nfresh and glowing, enforcing, with all his power, their acknowledgment\r\nand practical adoption. If there be but _one_ such man in the land, no\r\nmatter what becomes of abolition societies and parties, there will be\r\nan anti-slavery cause, and an anti-slavery movement. Fortunately for\r\nthat cause, and fortunately for him by whom it is espoused, it requires\r\nno extraordinary amount of talent to preach it or to receive it when\r\npreached. The grand secret of its power is, that each of its principles\r\nis easily rendered appreciable to the faculty of reason in man, and\r\nthat the most unenlightened conscience has no difficulty in deciding on\r\nwhich side to register its testimony. It can call its preachers from\r\namong the fishermen, and raise them to power. In every human breast, it\r\nhas an advocate which can be silent only when the heart is dead. It\r\ncomes home to every man’s understanding, and appeals directly to every\r\nman’s conscience. A man that does not recognize and approve for himself\r\nthe rights and privileges contended for, in behalf of the American\r\nslave, has not yet been found. In whatever else men may differ, they\r\nare alike in the apprehension of their natural and personal rights. The\r\ndifference between abolitionists and those by whom they are opposed, is\r\nnot as to principles. All are agreed in respect to these. The manner of\r\napplying them is the point of difference.\r\n\r\nThe slaveholder himself, the daily robber of his equal brother,\r\ndiscourses eloquently as to the excellency of justice, and the man who\r\nemploys a brutal driver to flay the flesh of his negroes, is not\r\noffended when kindness and humanity are commended. Every time the\r\nabolitionist speaks of justice, the anti-abolitionist assents says,\r\nyes, I wish the world were filled with a disposition to render to every\r\nman what is rightfully due him; I should then get what is due me.\r\nThat’s right; let us have justice. By all means, let us have justice.\r\nEvery time the abolitionist speaks in honor of human liberty, he\r\ntouches a chord in the heart of the anti-abolitionist, which responds\r\nin harmonious vibrations. Liberty—yes, that is evidently my right, and\r\nlet him beware who attempts to invade or abridge that right. Every time\r\nhe speaks of love, of human brotherhood, and the reciprocal duties of\r\nman and man, the anti-abolitionist assents—says, yes, all right—all\r\ntrue—we cannot have such ideas too often, or too fully expressed. So he\r\nsays, and so he feels, and only shows thereby that he is a man as well\r\nas an anti-abolitionist. You have only to keep out of sight the manner\r\nof applying your principles, to get them endorsed every time.\r\nContemplating himself, he sees truth with absolute clearness and\r\ndistinctness. He only blunders when asked to lose sight of himself. In\r\nhis own cause he can beat a Boston lawyer, but he is dumb when asked to\r\nplead the cause of others. He knows very well whatsoever he would have\r\ndone unto himself, but is quite in doubt as to having the same thing\r\ndone unto others. It is just here, that lions spring up in the path of\r\nduty, and the battle once fought in heaven is refought on the earth. So\r\nit is, so hath it ever been, and so must it ever be, when the claims of\r\njustice and mercy make their demand at the door of human selfishness.\r\nNevertheless, there is that within which ever pleads for the right and\r\nthe just.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have taken a sober view of the present anti-slavery\r\nmovement. I am sober, but not hopeless. There is no denying, for it is\r\neverywhere admitted, that the anti-slavery question is the great moral\r\nand social question now before the American people. A state of things\r\nhas gradually been developed, by which that question has become the\r\nfirst thing in order. It must be met. Herein is my hope. The great idea\r\nof impartial liberty is now fairly before the American people.\r\nAnti-slavery is no longer a thing to be prevented. The time for\r\nprevention is past. This is great gain. When the movement was younger\r\nand weaker—when it wrought in a Boston garret to human apprehension, it\r\nmight have been silently put out of the way. Things are different now.\r\nIt has grown too large—its friends are too numerous—its facilities too\r\nabundant—its ramifications too extended—its power too omnipotent, to be\r\nsnuffed out by the contingencies of infancy. A thousand strong men\r\nmight be struck down, and its ranks still be invincible. One flash from\r\nthe heart-supplied intellect of Harriet Beecher Stowe could light a\r\nmillion camp fires in front of the embattled host of slavery, which not\r\nall the waters of the Mississippi, mingled as they are with blood,\r\ncould extinguish. The present will be looked to by after coming\r\ngenerations, as the age of anti-slavery literature—when supply on the\r\ngallop could not keep pace with the ever growing demand—when a picture\r\nof a Negro on the cover was a help to the sale of a book—when\r\nconservative lyceums and other American literary associations began\r\nfirst to select their orators for distinguished occasions from the\r\nranks of the previously despised abolitionists. If the anti-slavery\r\nmovement shall fail now, it will not be from outward opposition, but\r\nfrom inward decay. Its auxiliaries are everywhere. Scholars, authors,\r\norators, poets, and statesmen give it their aid. The most brilliant of\r\nAmerican poets volunteer in its service. Whittier speaks in burning\r\nverse to more than thirty thousand, in the National Era. Your own\r\nLongfellow whispers, in every hour of trial and disappointment, “labor\r\nand wait.” James Russell Lowell is reminding us that “men are more than\r\ninstitutions.” Pierpont cheers the heart of the pilgrim in search of\r\nliberty, by singing the praises of “the north star.” Bryant, too, is\r\nwith us; and though chained to the car of party, and dragged on amidst\r\na whirl of political excitement, he snatches a moment for letting drop\r\na smiling verse of sympathy for the man in chains. The poets are with\r\nus. It would seem almost absurd to say it, considering the use that has\r\nbeen made of them, that we have allies in the Ethiopian songs; those\r\nsongs that constitute our national music, and without which we have no\r\nnational music. They are heart songs, and the finest feelings of human\r\nnature are expressed in them. “Lucy Neal,” “Old Kentucky Home,” and\r\n“Uncle Ned,” can make the heart sad as well as merry, and can call\r\nforth a tear as well as a smile. They awaken the sympathies for the\r\nslave, in which antislavery principles take root, grow, and flourish.\r\nIn addition to authors, poets, and scholars at home, the moral sense of\r\nthe civilized world is with us. England, France, and Germany, the three\r\ngreat lights of modern civilization, are with us, and every American\r\ntraveler learns to regret the existence of slavery in his country. The\r\ngrowth of intelligence, the influence of commerce, steam, wind, and\r\nlightning are our allies. It would be easy to amplify this summary, and\r\nto swell the vast conglomeration of our material forces; but there is a\r\ndeeper and truer method of measuring the power of our cause, and of\r\ncomprehending its vitality. This is to be found in its accordance with\r\nthe best elements of human nature. It is beyond the power of slavery to\r\nannihilate affinities recognized and established by the Almighty. The\r\nslave is bound to mankind by the powerful and inextricable net-work of\r\nhuman brotherhood. His voice is the voice of a man, and his cry is the\r\ncry of a man in distress, and man must cease to be man before he can\r\nbecome insensible to that cry. It is the righteous of the cause—the\r\nhumanity of the cause—which constitutes its potency. As one genuine\r\nbankbill is worth more than a thousand counterfeits, so is one man,\r\nwith right on his side, worth more than a thousand in the wrong. “One\r\nmay chase a thousand, and put ten thousand to flight.” It is,\r\ntherefore, upon the goodness of our cause, more than upon all other\r\nauxiliaries, that we depend for its final triumph.\r\n\r\nAnother source of congratulations is the fact that, amid all the\r\nefforts made by the church, the government, and the people at large, to\r\nstay the onward progress of this movement, its course has been onward,\r\nsteady, straight, unshaken, and unchecked from the beginning. Slavery\r\nhas gained victories large and numerous; but never as against this\r\nmovement—against a temporizing policy, and against northern timidity,\r\nthe slave power has been victorious; but against the spread and\r\nprevalence in the country, of a spirit of resistance to its aggression,\r\nand of sentiments favorable to its entire overthrow, it has yet\r\naccomplished nothing. Every measure, yet devised and executed, having\r\nfor its object the suppression of anti-slavery, has been as idle and\r\nfruitless as pouring oil to extinguish fire. A general rejoicing took\r\nplace on the passage of “the compromise measures” of 1850. Those\r\nmeasures were called peace measures, and were afterward termed by both\r\nthe great parties of the country, as well as by leading statesmen, a\r\nfinal settlement of the whole question of slavery; but experience has\r\nlaughed to scorn the wisdom of pro-slavery statesmen; and their final\r\nsettlement of agitation seems to be the final revival, on a broader and\r\ngrander scale than ever before, of the question which they vainly\r\nattempted to suppress forever. The fugitive slave bill has especially\r\nbeen of positive service to the anti-slavery movement. It has\r\nillustrated before all the people the horrible character of slavery\r\ntoward the slave, in hunting him down in a free state, and tearing him\r\naway from wife and children, thus setting its claims higher than\r\nmarriage or parental claims. It has revealed the arrogant and\r\noverbearing spirit of the slave states toward the free states;\r\ndespising their principles—shocking their feelings of humanity, not\r\nonly by bringing before them the abominations of slavery, but by\r\nattempting to make them parties to the crime. It has called into\r\nexercise among the colored people, the hunted ones, a spirit of manly\r\nresistance well calculated to surround them with a bulwark of sympathy\r\nand respect hitherto unknown. For men are always disposed to respect\r\nand defend rights, when the victims of oppression stand up manfully for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThere is another element of power added to the anti-slavery movement,\r\nof great importance; it is the conviction, becoming every day more\r\ngeneral and universal, that slavery must be abolished at the south, or\r\nit will demoralize and destroy liberty at the north. It is the nature\r\nof slavery to beget a state of things all around it favorable to its\r\nown continuance. This fact, connected with the system of bondage, is\r\nbeginning to be more fully realized. The slave-holder is not satisfied\r\nto associate with men in the church or in the state, unless he can\r\nthereby stain them with the blood of his slaves. To be a slave-holder\r\nis to be a propagandist from necessity; for slavery can only live by\r\nkeeping down the under-growth morality which nature supplies. Every\r\nnew-born white babe comes armed from the Eternal presence, to make war\r\non slavery. The heart of pity, which would melt in due time over the\r\nbrutal chastisements it sees inflicted on the helpless, must be\r\nhardened. And this work goes on every day in the year, and every hour\r\nin the day.\r\n\r\nWhat is done at home is being done also abroad here in the north. And\r\neven now the question may be asked, have we at this moment a single\r\nfree state in the Union? The alarm at this point will become more\r\ngeneral. The slave power must go on in its career of exactions. Give,\r\ngive, will be its cry, till the timidity which concedes shall give\r\nplace to courage, which shall resist. Such is the voice of experience,\r\nsuch has been the past, such is the present, and such will be that\r\nfuture, which, so sure as man is man, will come. Here I leave the\r\nsubject; and I leave off where I began, consoling myself and\r\ncongratulating the friends of freedom upon the fact that the\r\nanti-slavery cause is not a new thing under the sun; not some moral\r\ndelusion which a few years’ experience may dispel. It has appeared\r\namong men in all ages, and summoned its advocates from all ranks. Its\r\nfoundations are laid in the deepest and holiest convictions, and from\r\nwhatever soul the demon, selfishness, is expelled, there will this\r\ncause take up its abode. Old as the everlasting hills; immovable as the\r\nthrone of God; and certain as the purposes of eternal power, against\r\nall hinderances, and against all delays, and despite all the mutations\r\nof human instrumentalities, it is the faith of my soul, that this\r\nanti-slavery cause will triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Letter, Introduction to _Life of Frederick Douglass_,\r\nBoston, 1841.]\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ One of these ladies, impelled by the same noble spirit\r\nwhich carried Miss Nightingale to Scutari, has devoted her time, her\r\nuntiring energies, to a great extent her means, and her high literary\r\nabilities, to the advancement and support of Frederick Douglass’ Paper,\r\nthe only organ of the downtrodden, edited and published by one of\r\nthemselves, in the United States.]\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ Mr. Stephen Myers, of Albany, deserves mention as one of\r\nthe most persevering among the colored editorial fraternity.]\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ The German physiologists have even discovered vegetable\r\nmatter—starch—in the human body.
